[00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:06.626]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.626 --> 00:00:08.388]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.388 --> 00:00:10.149]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:11.730]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.292]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.292 --> 00:00:17.475]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:22.419]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:29.846]  Like dusk, sun sets on 2015.
[00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:31.007]  Now only three days left.
[00:00:31.977 --> 00:00:33.937]  Thank you so much for joining us, my friends.
[00:00:33.937 --> 00:00:35.898]  We're live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:35.898 --> 00:00:45.760]  It is Monday, the 28th day of December 2015, as we prepare to plunge into 2016 and beyond.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:58.083]  One of the first major preppers, and of course, anti-New World Order researchers, Steve Quayle, always thought-provoking, will be joining us in the second hour today.
[00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.294]  I intend to have open phones as well.
[00:01:04.294 --> 00:01:17.308]  But I was really thinking yesterday while I was out hiking with my son on the Austin Greenbelt.
[00:01:20.742 --> 00:01:26.104]  About what really is happening to our culture and our society.
[00:01:26.104 --> 00:01:31.987]  Removing who the major players are, even the controllers, or even what their master plan is.
[00:01:31.987 --> 00:01:33.808]  Where it's going.
[00:01:33.808 --> 00:01:38.350]  What's wrong with us?
[00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.951]  And I don't just mean Americans, obviously.
[00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:43.112]  I mean the planet itself.
[00:01:43.112 --> 00:01:48.174]  What's wrong with us?
[00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:49.495]  And it comes down to what?
[00:01:52.284 --> 00:02:12.412]  Many historians have pointed out, many sociologists, many anthropologists, many psychologists, but also just common sense breakdown shows that we are a very, very, very sick society.
[00:02:12.412 --> 00:02:16.054]  We are a rotting society.
[00:02:16.054 --> 00:02:18.755]  Matt Drudge was here a few months ago and he was criticized
[00:02:20.017 --> 00:02:25.259]  By some of the corporate media for saying that many Americans are sick mentally.
[00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.080]  We have a very sick country.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.862]  And he didn't say that from a position of, oh, I'm smart, I'm successful, and you're sick and pathetic.
[00:02:34.862 --> 00:02:39.443]  He said it with fear, or better word, be concerned.
[00:02:39.443 --> 00:02:43.505]  Maybe horror?
[00:02:43.505 --> 00:02:44.365]  Because let me tell you,
[00:02:47.335 --> 00:03:08.759]  You go out into any quote progressive liberal area, and boy conservatives have got their problems too, but you go into a trendy area and you call for banning free speech, you call for restricting freedom, you call for any evil you can imagine, but say it's for the Democratic Party, and they will salute and run that idea up the flagpole.
[00:03:11.067 --> 00:03:13.009]  They're dangerous.
[00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:15.271]  Very dangerous.
[00:03:15.271 --> 00:03:25.460]  And the climate for true oppression, for hardcore execution of totalitarianism,
[00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:33.307]  Has never been riper, not just here in the United States, but all over the world.
[00:03:33.307 --> 00:03:48.433]  And you add super weapons and huge populations and media, and most of the public in the Western world unable to tie their shoelaces, politically, or even physically.
[00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:53.395]  It is a time bomb of biblical proportions.
[00:03:55.117 --> 00:04:04.302]  And everything else we look at is just polishing silverware on the deck of the Titanic, 30 minutes into it hitting an iceberg.
[00:04:04.302 --> 00:04:07.144]  It's a fool's errand.
[00:04:07.144 --> 00:04:08.604]  Now, I can sit here and cover all this.
[00:04:08.604 --> 00:04:09.285]  It's interesting.
[00:04:09.285 --> 00:04:09.985]  It's entertaining.
[00:04:09.985 --> 00:04:11.046]  It's informative.
[00:04:11.046 --> 00:04:13.027]  It's what new listeners will be into.
[00:04:13.027 --> 00:04:22.032]  And I can't just sit here and be repetitive about globalism, but without even doing any research on fluoride this weekend, I saw a newscast
[00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:29.172]  And three mainstream news articles saying, okay, maybe it's not good for you, maybe it's bad.
[00:04:29.172 --> 00:04:32.874]  And you say, well, what does that mean?
[00:04:32.874 --> 00:04:42.240]  It means, folks, that they know it's all coming out, it was done by design, and they're trying to walk some of this stuff back now to the London Guardian today about how bad fluoride is for you.
[00:04:45.336 --> 00:04:48.238]  And you say, well, you say things are so bad, but now good things are happening.
[00:04:48.238 --> 00:04:48.738]  Exactly.
[00:04:48.738 --> 00:04:52.520]  It is a mixed bag, is what we're talking about.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.622]  We're in the fights, what I'm getting to.
[00:04:55.622 --> 00:04:56.002]  Stay with us.
[00:04:56.002 --> 00:04:59.444]  It's a big broadcast.
[00:04:59.444 --> 00:05:08.849]  GOP presidential hopeful Rand Paul has introduced legislation intended to block any effort by the incumbent president to enforce gun control by executive action.
[00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:14.072]  Paul's legislation named the Separation of Powers Restoration and Second Amendment Protection Act
[00:05:14.232 --> 00:05:21.097]  would render any action on gun legislation by the President which circumvents Congress as advisory only in nature.
[00:05:21.097 --> 00:05:29.943]  Paul's bill would apply to any executive action on gun control that either infringes upon congressional authority or potentially violates the Second Amendment.
[00:05:29.943 --> 00:05:38.709]  The bill then mandates that once an executive action has been classified as advisory only, it would require Congress to pass it in order for it to take effect.
[00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:42.752]  The bill also outlines that it is within their power for a state official
[00:05:42.992 --> 00:05:43.372]  We're good.
[00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.652]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:02.652 --> 00:06:10.917]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:06:10.917 --> 00:06:16.321]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:06:16.321 --> 00:06:18.862]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:06:18.862 --> 00:06:20.964]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:06:29.173 --> 00:06:33.556]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[00:06:33.556 --> 00:06:37.718]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.
[00:06:37.718 --> 00:06:42.641]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:06:42.641 --> 00:06:47.304]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.

[00:06:54.248 --> 00:06:56.089]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:06:58.931 --> 00:07:05.835]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[00:07:05.835 --> 00:07:08.717]  We've always offered five months free.
[00:07:08.717 --> 00:07:14.280]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.062]  PrisonPlanet.tv began 15 years ago.
[00:07:18.062 --> 00:07:21.344]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[00:07:21.344 --> 00:07:30.310]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books, and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:39.155]  You don't just get six months free when you sign up from Christmas through New Year's, you also get to share that membership with up to 20 people simultaneously.
[00:07:39.355 --> 00:07:39.756]  We're good.
[00:08:16.627 --> 00:08:17.768]  Big Brother.
[00:08:17.768 --> 00:08:19.569]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:19.569 --> 00:08:21.510]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.151]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:08:23.151 --> 00:08:24.812]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:24.812 --> 00:08:31.496]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:31.496 --> 00:08:33.217]  Take me to the center!
[00:08:33.217 --> 00:08:37.460]  Take me through the centuries to supersonic years!
[00:08:54.628 --> 00:08:59.290]  And what is the symptom of the universe that's written in our eyes?
[00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:03.372]  We're trying to answer that question today.
[00:09:03.372 --> 00:09:04.313]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:09:04.313 --> 00:09:07.934]  2015 is on its deathbed right now.
[00:09:07.934 --> 00:09:13.637]  The fire that began 362 days ago is almost out of its eyes.
[00:09:20.694 --> 00:09:28.800]  What was once a baby and then a child and then a man is now crawling into its deathbed.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:39.148]  And a whole nother year, a whole nother orbit of the sun is about to begin.
[00:09:39.148 --> 00:09:47.434]  But still humankind looks down into the dirt and worships the gods of Madison Avenue and Wall Street.
[00:09:47.434 --> 00:09:49.856]  The gods that would take their collective soul
[00:09:51.161 --> 00:09:52.582]  And bargain it.
[00:09:52.582 --> 00:09:54.562]  Sell it.
[00:09:54.562 --> 00:10:00.925]  For the perception of success.
[00:10:00.925 --> 00:10:03.426]  Wheels within wheels.
[00:10:03.426 --> 00:10:08.448]  Counterfeits of copies that were never real to begin with.
[00:10:08.448 --> 00:10:11.650]  Frauds built upon lies.
[00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:15.311]  Built upon shaky ground.
[00:10:15.311 --> 00:10:16.612]  Built upon an attempt
[00:10:18.988 --> 00:10:30.491]  For fallen men to play God.
[00:10:30.491 --> 00:10:31.472]  Where to start?
[00:10:31.472 --> 00:10:41.935]  As usual, there's too much news, so let me just calmly, because I really want to try to be calm today, at least for part of the broadcast, just give you some of the headlines.
[00:10:41.935 --> 00:10:44.836]  And then you can connect the dots however you'd like.
[00:10:44.836 --> 00:10:46.096]  Here's the London Guardian.
[00:10:48.044 --> 00:10:56.071]  Adding fluoride to water supply may have no benefits, say experts.
[00:10:56.071 --> 00:10:58.354]  And then you read the article.
[00:10:58.354 --> 00:11:08.543]  The headline should be, Top Experts and Hundreds of Studies Show Lower IQ in Children, Bladder Cancer, Bone Cancer, and Reduced Fertility.
[00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:10.505]  It actually says that in the fourth paragraph.
[00:11:12.318 --> 00:11:16.039]  That's the major paper in England and the English paper of Europe.
[00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:21.742]  The most read paper probably in the world.
[00:11:21.742 --> 00:11:24.323]  It's also in the Daily Mail.
[00:11:24.323 --> 00:11:28.564]  Oh, I may have heard that before 20 years ago on a show hosted by Alex Jones.
[00:11:28.564 --> 00:11:37.348]  And by the way, I don't want credit for that, but they had almost 400 articles last Monday, eight days ago.
[00:11:39.761 --> 00:11:50.689]  A syndicated column by Rachel Maddow in the Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, LA Times, I mean it was in, you could see the numbers, it was like 387 or something.
[00:11:50.689 --> 00:11:52.511]  The next day it was even more, it was in more papers.
[00:11:52.511 --> 00:12:02.879]  The next day, I didn't add them together, I think it was like 700 papers in two days saying I am totally insane and believe that Obama sends tornadoes.
[00:12:03.968 --> 00:12:14.518]  And that WASP live under the UN building, and then it would mix in there, and he says fluoride's bad for you.
[00:12:17.756 --> 00:12:18.756]  There were different versions.
[00:12:18.756 --> 00:12:22.558]  One of them, the original was like five pages long, but a lot of papers cut it down.
[00:12:22.558 --> 00:12:25.018]  So I don't know which version you read.
[00:12:25.018 --> 00:12:42.364]  And you sit there, I mean, I've got 26 Harvard studies, hundreds of Japanese, Chinese, I've got dozens and dozens of University of Texas studies, some of them back in the 30s, rat studies, reducing fertility, lowering their cognitive ability, that's their thinking, their IQs.
[00:12:44.226 --> 00:12:55.654]  The physical IQ of North Americans since fluoridation in 1947 is down upwards of 20 points, and it's accelerated.
[00:12:55.654 --> 00:12:59.216]  I can pull up the main... I mean, folks, it's not that we're not getting educated.
[00:12:59.216 --> 00:13:01.838]  We've been hit with a chemical weapon.
[00:13:01.838 --> 00:13:06.141]  That's one article I've got of literally probably 150 today.
[00:13:06.141 --> 00:13:06.481]  Conservatively.
[00:13:10.114 --> 00:13:11.655]  There's probably 200 articles.
[00:13:11.655 --> 00:13:13.796]  Each one just as important as that.
[00:13:13.796 --> 00:13:17.097]  And you read, oh it may not help you!
[00:13:17.097 --> 00:13:19.878]  And then you read the article, because it's like they've got to tell you.
[00:13:19.878 --> 00:13:37.246]  They think the public's so stunned now, that when their reporters come to them, who are well-meaning people, like Haroon Sidquay at the London Guardian, and says, all these experts are coming out, even people in the National Health Service of England say take it out of the water.
[00:13:37.246 --> 00:13:39.607]  They go, yeah, go ahead and say it might not help people.
[00:13:41.667 --> 00:13:46.889]  Because then it's like, told, like, hi, my name's Count Dracula, I live in the castle up the hill.
[00:13:46.889 --> 00:13:48.030]  You have a nice little cottage here.
[00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:51.371]  Do you mind if I come in?
[00:13:51.371 --> 00:13:53.212]  Sure, come on in.
[00:13:53.212 --> 00:13:55.293]  Oh, thank you.
[00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:58.094]  I've got to go now, but thanks for inviting me in.
[00:13:58.094 --> 00:14:02.336]  I'll be back.
[00:14:02.336 --> 00:14:04.877]  They metaphysically have to tell you what they're doing.
[00:14:07.441 --> 00:14:09.863]  And folks, I've got news for you.
[00:14:09.863 --> 00:14:15.368]  Most water supplies in the United States get their fluoride from China.
[00:14:15.368 --> 00:14:22.434]  And my main goal is to just report something here and challenge listeners to call local news, and the local news does investigations.
[00:14:22.434 --> 00:14:25.817]  And we got Oklahoma and Arkansas, of all places, a few years ago.
[00:14:25.817 --> 00:14:29.039]  They did local newscasts on what we talked about, thank God.
[00:14:29.039 --> 00:14:30.981]  That's the listeners taking action.
[00:14:30.981 --> 00:14:34.124]  And they actually went and got the Chinese-made fluoride
[00:14:35.046 --> 00:14:37.647]  That just says fluoride in the bag from China has a skull and crossbones.
[00:14:37.647 --> 00:14:44.128]  They went and tested it and in one town it had 300 plus chemicals and the other had 200 and something.
[00:14:44.128 --> 00:14:46.409]  Lead, mercury, arsenic, you name it.
[00:14:46.409 --> 00:14:50.830]  They don't just put hydrofluorosilic acid in the water.
[00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.211]  They don't just put sodium fluoride in the water.
[00:14:54.211 --> 00:15:02.593]  They put hundreds of chemicals including ground up radium in limestone.
[00:15:02.593 --> 00:15:03.034]  Radium.
[00:15:04.798 --> 00:15:06.259]  Radium.
[00:15:06.259 --> 00:15:08.800]  Radioactive isotopes.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.820]  People don't believe me.
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:10.701]  They call local news.
[00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:11.201]  They laugh.
[00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:14.102]  They go stick a Geiger counter to city pipes.
[00:15:14.102 --> 00:15:15.503]  Off the charts, folks.
[00:15:15.503 --> 00:15:16.063]  And that's what I mean.
[00:15:16.063 --> 00:15:18.424]  It's a Twilight Zone episode.
[00:15:18.424 --> 00:15:20.165]  That's one article.
[00:15:20.165 --> 00:15:26.768]  And so where are we now that every few days I see articles going, oh, you might not want to give your kids fluoride.
[00:15:26.768 --> 00:15:28.188]  It gives them fluorosis.
[00:15:28.188 --> 00:15:31.730]  They're trying to creep out and go, maybe we were a little wrong.
[00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:32.950]  Folks, they weren't wrong.
[00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:34.091]  They knew what they did.
[00:15:35.669 --> 00:15:49.918]  And they've moved on now to stacked genes in corn and wheat and soybeans that are designed to literally transmutate.
[00:15:49.918 --> 00:15:52.200]  That's not supposed to happen unless you quote have cancer.
[00:15:53.499 --> 00:15:57.621]  Mutations start in the genetic and an embryonic level and generally play out from there.
[00:15:57.621 --> 00:16:00.863]  These are mutations while you're alive.
[00:16:00.863 --> 00:16:11.329]  While you're already run your original genetic program, they're injecting it in and we're getting mutations never before seen and just thousands of new cancers.
[00:16:11.329 --> 00:16:12.609]  Thousands!
[00:16:12.609 --> 00:16:14.750]  Thousands are arriving!
[00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:15.371]  Plagues!
[00:16:17.674 --> 00:16:25.588]  Everywhere, everywhere are 25, 30, 40 year old women I know and friends know, they're just dying of lung cancer everywhere.
[00:16:25.588 --> 00:16:27.732]  They don't even smoke.
[00:16:30.455 --> 00:16:41.718]  Because there's a particular virus, a family of viruses that have been found in many vaccines, it's beyond the SV40, that particularly hits women and gives them lung cancer.
[00:16:41.718 --> 00:16:52.780]  And see, this is hitting different people, like males can't handle mercury because our blood-brain barrier is not as strong, so 87% of autistics are boys.
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.921]  We're not as strong blood-brain barrier as women.
[00:16:55.677 --> 00:16:57.658]  But in other areas, women are weaker.
[00:16:57.658 --> 00:17:05.423]  And then, I get to hear about feminists at Time Magazine are mad that Harrison Ford got paid more money than the girl that played Rey.
[00:17:05.423 --> 00:17:15.130]  That's how they stand up for you, while the establishment slowly murders you.
[00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:22.915]  And I'll be at a party or something, and there'll be some weird feminist trying to dominate, shooting their mouth off, trying to say stuff to men to make them guilty, guys groveling to them, and I'll just go,
[00:17:24.465 --> 00:17:26.446]  This is an end of the human race program.
[00:17:26.446 --> 00:17:28.548]  It's a scientific takeover.
[00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:33.391]  Stop coming in here to exercise your assertiveness and dominate people.
[00:17:33.391 --> 00:17:37.834]  Then they start usually groveling or apologizing, and I go, listen, I don't want you to grovel or apologize.
[00:17:37.834 --> 00:17:40.255]  I know nobody ever stood up to you.
[00:17:40.255 --> 00:17:41.916]  You've been trained to be a basket case.
[00:17:41.916 --> 00:17:43.197]  You're under attack.
[00:17:43.197 --> 00:17:53.804]  You've been given a false imprint of what you're supposed to be threatened by so the globalists can savage you psychologically, culturally, spiritually, mentally, and you're unaware of what's even going on.
[00:17:57.418 --> 00:18:03.381]  I mean, it's a joke to walk around in the public and to know the type of attack they're under.
[00:18:03.381 --> 00:18:12.626]  Health experts are calling for a moratorium on water fluoridation, claiming that the benefits of such schemes are opposed to those topical fluoride directly applied to the teeth are unproven.
[00:18:12.626 --> 00:18:21.030]  Furthermore, critics cite studies showing identifying a number of possible negative associations of fluoride, including bone cancer, bladder cancer,
[00:18:22.392 --> 00:18:26.975]  Hyperthyroidism just exploding in women, hip fractures, and lower IQ!
[00:18:26.975 --> 00:18:28.716]  Oh!
[00:18:28.716 --> 00:18:30.878]  The London Guardian?
[00:18:30.878 --> 00:18:34.641]  Where's my apologies from all the conservative hosts that attack me?
[00:18:34.641 --> 00:18:35.101]  Oh!
[00:18:35.101 --> 00:18:36.021]  The 28 pages?
[00:18:36.021 --> 00:18:38.183]  We have senators and congressmen who've looked at it?
[00:18:38.183 --> 00:18:40.685]  Say our government stood down?
[00:18:40.685 --> 00:18:43.046]  Protected the Bin Ladens?
[00:18:43.046 --> 00:18:46.509]  Ordered the FBI in five states not to stop the hijackers?
[00:18:50.916 --> 00:18:52.937]  Bare minimum order to stand down.
[00:18:52.937 --> 00:18:56.979]  Attacked the country that didn't attack us, Iraq.
[00:18:56.979 --> 00:18:59.840]  Oh, 9-11, truth was right again!
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.981]  Oh, where's the apology?
[00:19:00.981 --> 00:19:02.922]  I could go on for days.
[00:19:02.922 --> 00:19:07.003]  We broke Benghazi, the week it happened, and said it was a hit for missiles.
[00:19:07.003 --> 00:19:12.146]  And I'm not bragging, but I'm willing to go up to every machine gun nest and throw political hand grenades in.
[00:19:13.462 --> 00:19:25.665]  So just understand, while everybody else sits back and makes fun of Alex Jones, or Infowars, or says we're wrong, or we lie about this or that, that's because they're either little cowards, they're gutter snipes, or they're on the globalist payroll.
[00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:30.286]  We will continue to trailblaze 110% committed to the truth.
[00:19:30.286 --> 00:19:31.907]  And we'll stumble, we'll fall.
[00:19:31.907 --> 00:19:34.667]  We're always going towards the objective, given it our 110%.
[00:19:34.667 --> 00:19:38.468]  And that's my commitment to you going into 2016.
[00:19:38.468 --> 00:19:40.109]  I told you a year ago I was turning the heat up.
[00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.433]  We're turning it up even more next year.
[00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:46.417]  Because we're going in, through, and beyond.
[00:19:46.417 --> 00:19:49.841]  We're on a collision course with the New World Order.
[00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:52.965]  And nothing but the good Lord above is going to stop us.
[00:19:52.965 --> 00:19:57.090]  Because if God be with us, who can be against us?
[00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:06.659]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country.
[00:20:06.659 --> 00:20:10.661]  It caught me totally by surprise, and it involves FEMA.
[00:20:10.661 --> 00:20:14.063]  I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof.
[00:20:14.063 --> 00:20:19.147]  Revealing their secret could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[00:20:19.747 --> 00:20:30.273]  Watch the viral video at FEMA3.com before it disappears again, but be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is, they must know something we don't.
[00:20:30.273 --> 00:20:40.279]  Go to FEMA3.com to see the number one item you should be hoarding and why supplies of this critical item are so low or even completely sold out at many stores across America.

[00:24:00.135 --> 00:24:20.268]  No one knows what it's like to be the bad man To be the sad man behind blue eyes No one knows what it's like to be hated
[00:24:22.006 --> 00:24:27.307]  To telling only lies.
[00:24:27.307 --> 00:24:29.608]  Imagine working for MSNBC.
[00:24:29.608 --> 00:24:33.709]  They're brief folks.
[00:24:33.709 --> 00:24:35.349]  They know the program.
[00:24:35.349 --> 00:24:37.630]  Rachel Maddow, Melissa Harris-Perry.
[00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:46.532]  They're different programs.
[00:24:46.532 --> 00:24:47.632]  They're the most dishonorable,
[00:24:49.781 --> 00:24:57.568]  Heartless, soulless scum you could ever imagine.
[00:24:57.568 --> 00:25:03.854]  I got into my whole quandary, my problem, because I could spend an entire three-hour, four-hour show, or now four hours, 11 a.m.
[00:25:03.854 --> 00:25:04.655]  to 3 p.m.
[00:25:04.655 --> 00:25:06.977]  Central.
[00:25:06.977 --> 00:25:09.759]  I could spend days, really, on this one article.
[00:25:09.759 --> 00:25:13.383]  Adding fluoride to water supply may have no benefit, say experts.
[00:25:16.124 --> 00:25:21.091]  Critics call for end of scheme designed to prevent tooth decay in children saying its effectiveness remains unproven.
[00:25:21.091 --> 00:25:26.860]  So they run that spin and then get into, oh, here's all these studies that it gives you cancer and lowers your IQ.
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:32.348]  I mean, you don't drink sunscreen to not get a suntan or not get burned.
[00:25:33.311 --> 00:25:34.612]  And it's not even fluoride.
[00:25:34.612 --> 00:25:56.047]  They take heavy metal, grignard reagent, toxic waste from the fertilizer and metal smelting and other industrial systems, and they have a 1940s waiver, World War II waiver, to then process it and put it into feeds, put it into foods, put it into medicines, put it into anything they want.
[00:25:56.047 --> 00:25:59.450]  Now, they do have a strange law that passed later in the 70s, you can look it up.
[00:26:00.606 --> 00:26:05.589]  Where have you ever noticed you'll get lawn fertilizer and it'll say not for crops?
[00:26:05.589 --> 00:26:10.931]  Because it's got toxins in it?
[00:26:10.931 --> 00:26:16.754]  So, they won't even let you put this in some of the crop fertilizer.
[00:26:16.754 --> 00:26:21.157]  By the way, they use fluoride as a pesticide, still.
[00:26:21.157 --> 00:26:24.859]  EPA said take it out four years ago, they still haven't done it.
[00:26:24.859 --> 00:26:28.741]  And it bioaccumulates, they spray it on grapes, they spray it on basically on everything.
[00:26:28.741 --> 00:26:29.381]  It's one of the top
[00:26:30.933 --> 00:26:31.453]  Pesticides.
[00:26:31.453 --> 00:26:36.596]  There's been a pesticide used for 200 years in Europe and the United States.
[00:26:36.596 --> 00:26:37.897]  Over 200.
[00:26:37.897 --> 00:26:41.118]  It was used right around after the Revolutionary War.
[00:26:41.118 --> 00:26:42.819]  It's one of the oldest pesticides known.
[00:26:42.819 --> 00:26:46.301]  Oh, but the scientists didn't know when they put it in the water what it would do.
[00:26:46.301 --> 00:26:58.188]  They put an excitotoxin adjuvant bug killer into your food and water.
[00:26:59.389 --> 00:27:01.231]  And see, I can just keep going for hours.
[00:27:01.231 --> 00:27:02.812]  It's a fact.
[00:27:02.812 --> 00:27:06.916]  And so, what does that say about who runs things?
[00:27:06.916 --> 00:27:08.837]  Riddle me this.
[00:27:08.837 --> 00:27:15.603]  For five years, our hijacked criminal government has been funding al-Qaeda, known as al-Nusra.
[00:27:15.603 --> 00:27:16.824]  Same group, admittedly.
[00:27:16.824 --> 00:27:20.568]  Remember that Reuters headline?
[00:27:20.568 --> 00:27:23.811]  US says Russia bombing the good rebels.
[00:27:23.811 --> 00:27:26.193]  The al-Nusra group, al-Qaeda of Syria.
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.641]  With a straight face, first paragraph, and it was all over the news.
[00:27:30.641 --> 00:27:34.202]  How dare you bomb the good guys Al-Qaeda?
[00:27:34.202 --> 00:27:38.063]  Just throwing it in our face, rubbing it in our face.
[00:27:38.063 --> 00:27:47.126]  And then they send them over there, and they murder over 300,000 people, the majority of them Christians, in the most heinous ways.
[00:27:47.126 --> 00:27:56.249]  They press the young girls down to age five into sex slavery, and then hundreds of jihadis line up and rape them until they die.
[00:27:57.523 --> 00:28:03.787]  Two, three days, no food, no water, being beaten savagely until they die.
[00:28:03.787 --> 00:28:05.769]  Look it up.
[00:28:05.769 --> 00:28:09.651]  Syrian rebels rape women and children to death.
[00:28:09.651 --> 00:28:11.232]  Look up that headline.
[00:28:11.232 --> 00:28:13.434]  They eat hearts on television.
[00:28:13.434 --> 00:28:18.597]  And who does our government fund this very scum?
[00:28:18.597 --> 00:28:23.761]  Oh, they put bug poison in your water and spray it on most of the powdered
[00:28:24.827 --> 00:28:30.268]  Preparations for biscuits, bread, pancake mix?
[00:28:30.268 --> 00:28:31.729]  300 parts?
[00:28:31.729 --> 00:28:33.009]  600 parts?
[00:28:33.009 --> 00:28:34.449]  900 parts per million?
[00:28:34.449 --> 00:28:35.470]  Look it up.
[00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:40.331]  Do you know what 1.6 parts per million does to an IQ?
[00:28:40.331 --> 00:28:46.352]  On average in federal studies, 10 point reductions every three years of use.
[00:28:46.352 --> 00:28:47.553]  Devastatedly stupid.
[00:28:48.925 --> 00:28:50.966]  You'd lose 20, 30 points.
[00:28:50.966 --> 00:28:54.729]  If you were an average person, you're now mentally retarded.
[00:28:54.729 --> 00:28:59.011]  If you were a genius, you're now just smart.
[00:28:59.011 --> 00:29:02.113]  Isn't that a gift from the loving people?
[00:29:02.113 --> 00:29:04.215]  Oh, but judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:29:04.215 --> 00:29:05.355]  Everything else they do.
[00:29:05.355 --> 00:29:07.877]  Infant mortality is exploding back up off the charts now.
[00:29:09.753 --> 00:29:13.574]  Pediatric cancers are up tens of thousands of percentage points.
[00:29:13.574 --> 00:29:15.475]  By the way, that's just a few cancers.
[00:29:15.475 --> 00:29:16.995]  I actually looked it up this weekend.
[00:29:16.995 --> 00:29:23.137]  Some cancers that didn't exist 20 years ago are up hundreds of thousands of percentage points in their growth curves.
[00:29:23.137 --> 00:29:24.957]  They didn't exist before.
[00:29:24.957 --> 00:29:26.097]  And now they're just everywhere.
[00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:29.118]  And it's all by design.
[00:29:29.118 --> 00:29:35.660]  And any of the real treatments or things they develop testing on us are securited into the globalist
[00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:47.076]  Reservations, their techno city systems, their shadow government basins, for use by the elite, not to be transferred to us!
[00:29:47.076 --> 00:29:48.596]  We'll be back!
[00:29:48.596 --> 00:29:52.518]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.518 --> 00:29:55.220]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.286 --> 00:30:02.788]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:30:02.788 --> 00:30:11.033]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:30:11.033 --> 00:30:16.457]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:30:16.457 --> 00:30:18.978]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:30:18.978 --> 00:30:21.080]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:30.270]  BrainForce is here.
[00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:32.491]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:30:32.491 --> 00:30:37.473]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:30:37.473 --> 00:30:40.774]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:30:40.774 --> 00:30:44.255]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:30:44.255 --> 00:30:46.235]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:30:46.235 --> 00:30:50.336]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean.
[00:30:50.336 --> 00:30:55.918]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:30:59.853 --> 00:31:06.659]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[00:31:06.659 --> 00:31:09.541]  We've always offered five months free.
[00:31:09.541 --> 00:31:15.466]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[00:31:15.466 --> 00:31:18.889]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[00:31:18.889 --> 00:31:22.192]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[00:31:22.192 --> 00:31:24.934]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books,
[00:31:25.094 --> 00:31:25.594]  We're good to go.
[00:31:42.128 --> 00:31:49.695]  You can also sign up for a trial month and only pay $5.95, and then 20 of you and your friends and family can watch PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:49.695 --> 00:31:51.958]  Get 20 memberships at half price.
[00:31:51.958 --> 00:31:53.880]  Be the Paul Revere in your community.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.423]  That's 6 months free when you sign up for a year at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:59.406 --> 00:32:03.289]  A lot of people's lives and bodies are out of balance.
[00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:08.713]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops optimize pH level and get rid of harmful waste and acid.
[00:32:08.713 --> 00:32:13.257]  Just a few drops in water restores vibrance and energy and gets you back in balance.

[00:33:15.752 --> 00:33:20.379]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:20.379 --> 00:33:24.265]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:29.477 --> 00:33:56.014]  When you start reading the globalist white papers, when you start reading the globalist textbooks that they use at PhD and above level, when they talk about us as ugly animals that must be exterminated, that must have our free will taken, that must be dumbed down before their world government can come into place, and then how we'll all be systematically wiped out with designer bio-weapons that the controllers will be given immunity to, you know why Ian Fleming wrote Moonraker at that point.
[00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:02.753]  And then, well, football games don't matter as much as they did.
[00:34:02.753 --> 00:34:09.818]  Or somebody cutting you off in traffic doesn't really matter anymore because you don't take it personal anymore.
[00:34:09.818 --> 00:34:12.920]  You are now awake while the rest of the public sleeps.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:20.285]  But you're not a psychological, spiritual, cultural vampire like the globalists.
[00:34:20.285 --> 00:34:22.907]  There are two types of people in general.
[00:34:22.907 --> 00:34:25.649]  Those that are awake, those that aren't.
[00:34:25.649 --> 00:34:27.731]  But in the group that's awake, there is the
[00:34:29.542 --> 00:34:41.127]  Separation of those that decide to use the ignorance of the general public against them, and those that decide to try to empower the general public.
[00:34:41.127 --> 00:34:49.371]  And the general public's been given all these different programs, all these different learned responses, all these different hypnotic suggestions, you name it.
[00:34:49.371 --> 00:34:54.333]  It's all being used and tested as they develop better and better systems of control.
[00:34:55.515 --> 00:35:05.926]  You're looking at engineered victims, and they're certainly dangerous, they're certainly arrogant, they're certainly narcissistic, they're certainly sociopathic, they're certainly insecure.
[00:35:05.926 --> 00:35:10.370]  It's a mix of what they've done to the public.
[00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:11.752]  And it's very easy to hate them.
[00:35:11.752 --> 00:35:14.154]  It's very easy to want to hide from them.
[00:35:15.086 --> 00:35:29.373]  But we have to get in there and find as many of these people that still have some consciousness as we can to try to get in there and shake them out of their trance so they can start looking around them and get out of this matrix.
[00:35:29.373 --> 00:35:34.296]  It really comes down to that.
[00:35:34.296 --> 00:35:42.080]  So, the worst thing you can do is sardonically start having the attitude of the establishment and just seeing the public as a bunch of dumb lemmings.
[00:35:43.493 --> 00:35:50.596]  And then getting off on that, having some sort of sick satisfaction.
[00:35:50.596 --> 00:35:54.818]  That's the worst thing you can do, because this isn't funny.
[00:35:54.818 --> 00:36:04.463]  And don't think all this cultural evil, all this cultural twistedness, isn't going to blow back on everybody.
[00:36:04.463 --> 00:36:12.547]  That's another big lie the establishment have told themselves, that they somehow can transcend what they've helped do.
[00:36:15.831 --> 00:36:21.496]  Now I just mentioned one article and went off on a 30 minute jag about it.
[00:36:21.496 --> 00:36:24.578]  But it's a pretty big deal.
[00:36:24.578 --> 00:36:30.923]  They've always known that you need a very small amount of calcium fluoride in your diet or you'll die.
[00:36:30.923 --> 00:36:36.207]  And it's used in bone formation and a lot of other activities in the body.
[00:36:36.207 --> 00:36:43.073]  What they put in the water is not calcium fluoride.
[00:36:43.073 --> 00:36:43.193]  It's
[00:36:45.393 --> 00:36:51.754]  Jacked up, electrified acid.
[00:36:51.754 --> 00:36:59.955]  That then is an adjuvant so they don't have to put as many of the other drugs in the water supply that they add for social engineering.
[00:36:59.955 --> 00:37:05.256]  It's a booster, a money saver.
[00:37:05.256 --> 00:37:06.657]  Don't you understand?
[00:37:06.657 --> 00:37:07.997]  You want to make fun of the public?
[00:37:07.997 --> 00:37:09.737]  Folks, they're drugged.
[00:37:09.737 --> 00:37:11.818]  They were raised in front of televisions from birth.
[00:37:11.818 --> 00:37:14.458]  It's a wonder they can function at the level they can.
[00:37:20.052 --> 00:37:21.253]  Again, that's what this comes down to.
[00:37:21.253 --> 00:37:37.189]  It's the incredible, over-the-top, epic, legendary truth that we are living in the beginning of a directed, scientific dictatorship that is meant to end humanity as we know it.
[00:37:37.189 --> 00:37:43.836]  And again, that's the emergency transmission I continue to send out because outside of that, all of this is just window dressing.
[00:37:50.592 --> 00:37:56.275]  That's one article out of hundreds.
[00:37:56.275 --> 00:37:57.536]  Let me get into some of these articles.
[00:37:57.536 --> 00:37:59.617]  I mean, look at this one.
[00:37:59.617 --> 00:38:05.480]  Obamacare is sucking up to 10% of Americans' incomes.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.401]  And that's on top of what healthcare used to cost.
[00:38:07.401 --> 00:38:09.822]  I mean, just devastating.
[00:38:09.822 --> 00:38:11.703]  Talk about a wet blanket on the economy.
[00:38:11.703 --> 00:38:13.384]  That's it.
[00:38:13.384 --> 00:38:15.065]  The cashless society cometh.
[00:38:15.065 --> 00:38:18.487]  European nations, such as Sweden and Denmark, are eradicating cash.
[00:38:19.363 --> 00:38:28.448]  The average person thinks that if they just accept something, that gives them power over it.
[00:38:28.448 --> 00:38:35.693]  Instead of understanding, they can then tax you, track you, control you, and then make you pay money to use the digital money.
[00:38:37.563 --> 00:38:42.046]  It will give them the greatest control over individual freedom in markets the world has ever seen.
[00:38:42.046 --> 00:38:45.207]  If you think they're rigging markets now, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:38:45.207 --> 00:38:48.649]  And they're not rigging markets to make the general public prosperous.
[00:38:48.649 --> 00:38:52.932]  They're rigging markets to consolidate control.
[00:38:52.932 --> 00:38:57.554]  But I hear the average yuppie go, I don't care, I just want a chip, it'll be so much easier.
[00:38:57.554 --> 00:38:58.915]  Oh, it'll be a lot easier.
[00:38:58.915 --> 00:39:06.079]  Yeah, they want to move us to a system where underground economies are impossible because they really care about us.
[00:39:08.103 --> 00:39:20.075]  We're not being domesticated because we're going to be like Shetland ponies on the back hundred acres that the little girls go out to and feed sugar cubes to.
[00:39:20.075 --> 00:39:24.120]  We're not being domesticated to even be eaten.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.223]  Though in the process our organs will be harvested when the elite want to.
[00:39:29.164 --> 00:39:40.768]  We're being domesticated because we're seen as a dangerous scourge that has to be defanged, declawed, and chained down before we are decapitated.
[00:39:40.768 --> 00:39:45.070]  And the chains are going on right now.
[00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:52.972]  And I'm here, transcending all the mindless politics, the distractions, the diversions, and telling you the elite have a plan to go to the stars.
[00:39:52.972 --> 00:39:54.373]  And we ain't in that club.
[00:39:58.248 --> 00:40:05.174]  And then the Klan bashing black people and the Black Lives Matter people running around stirring up trouble for Soros.
[00:40:05.174 --> 00:40:07.516]  All of it becomes a sick joke.
[00:40:07.516 --> 00:40:16.664]  When you go, why would they have a weird Nazi collaborator running the Democratic Party?
[00:40:16.664 --> 00:40:18.766]  Because that's who these people are.
[00:40:18.766 --> 00:40:21.348]  They're not Nazis.
[00:40:21.348 --> 00:40:25.132]  They just like somebody that was so soulless he'd sell out his own people.
[00:40:27.381 --> 00:40:30.363]  They admire each other's evil.
[00:40:30.363 --> 00:40:43.451]  They admire each other for how many people they've killed.
[00:40:43.451 --> 00:40:44.071]  Good God.
[00:40:44.071 --> 00:40:47.974]  I don't think the average person's read a billion percent of these books like I have.
[00:40:47.974 --> 00:40:49.675]  I mean, they're so evil.
[00:40:52.927 --> 00:40:56.188]  To brag about how he helped create the Khmer Rouge.
[00:40:56.188 --> 00:41:00.409]  To kill 35% of the population.
[00:41:00.409 --> 00:41:09.151]  And to watch him at Council on Foreign Relations meetings when they salute him and just look at him like he is a rock star.
[00:41:09.151 --> 00:41:11.452]  Only thing these people respect is somebody that's killed millions.
[00:41:11.452 --> 00:41:17.574]  And that's why I sit there and watch his daughter on TV say she wants our guns.
[00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:23.512]  And spur race-baiting garbage.
[00:41:23.512 --> 00:41:26.513]  And that's why she just makes me want to throw up.
[00:41:26.513 --> 00:41:28.153]  I don't even hate her.
[00:41:28.153 --> 00:41:33.895]  I just see an enemy.
[00:41:33.895 --> 00:41:39.957]  I just see a threat to my family.
[00:41:39.957 --> 00:41:41.878]  It's time to grow up, folks.
[00:41:41.878 --> 00:41:44.019]  It's time to assess the real threat.
[00:41:44.019 --> 00:41:45.339]  We're ready.
[00:41:45.339 --> 00:41:47.560]  We know the enemy operation.
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:48.060]  We're committed.
[00:41:50.595 --> 00:42:00.703]  And the most important thing about this broadcast is we're giving insiders who are somewhat compartmentalized a chance to decompartmentalize and to know we're telling the truth.
[00:42:00.703 --> 00:42:07.069]  And to really ask yourself, do you really think you can work with this and it's not going to burn you and your family in the end?
[00:42:08.228 --> 00:42:12.550]  You may say, well, I'm just waiting for others to wake up and hopefully, you know, this thing gets rolled back.
[00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:17.972]  Historically, these things get rolled back and I just want to stay out of the way until the pendulum swings the other way.
[00:42:17.972 --> 00:42:26.396]  They're trying to suspend those laws now and bring in what they call the final revolution.
[00:42:26.396 --> 00:42:32.118]  And when you read deeper into the final revolution, look that term up.
[00:42:34.682 --> 00:42:50.268]  It is a world-ending, human-ending, God-event, in their words, where they overwrite in a giant satanic ritual, basically, is what all this is.
[00:42:50.268 --> 00:42:59.492]  The GMO, the splicing the bugs with humans, the cows with humans growing in utero for harvesting in China.
[00:43:00.899 --> 00:43:02.219]  You know, that's on record.
[00:43:02.219 --> 00:43:04.560]  They got stocks that trade on it.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:10.042]  Fifteen years ago, I was like reading stock portfolios about cameras and microphones, listening and watching.
[00:43:10.042 --> 00:43:11.543]  I'd come and say, look!
[00:43:11.543 --> 00:43:12.603]  Oh, shut up, crazy!
[00:43:12.603 --> 00:43:15.664]  Nowadays, it's like, sure, they watch and listen.
[00:43:15.664 --> 00:43:24.827]  And humans being grown inside cows up to full size to get larger organs, and you're just like, what?
[00:43:24.827 --> 00:43:26.548]  Not in Kansas anymore, folks!
[00:43:27.807 --> 00:43:29.608]  People say, well, why aren't you afraid they'll come get you?
[00:43:29.608 --> 00:43:31.569]  They already got me!
[00:43:31.569 --> 00:43:39.813]  They've already got jet-spraying aluminum everywhere and they admitted it last week, and the plants are dying, the bugs, they're just crazy people!
[00:43:39.813 --> 00:43:48.218]  They're overriding the planet.
[00:43:48.218 --> 00:43:56.943]  They're playing God, and they just believe that they'll develop all these super technologies in the process that will allow them to just repopulate worlds
[00:43:58.882 --> 00:44:00.843]  Well, whenever they want, like they're God.
[00:44:00.843 --> 00:44:09.226]  And all I'm saying is, I wasn't consulted, you weren't consulted.
[00:44:09.226 --> 00:44:13.408]  Guys, this monitor's dead in here, just a heads up.
[00:44:13.408 --> 00:44:17.650]  So, let me continue here.
[00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:19.271]  Here, now let's go back to the news.
[00:44:19.271 --> 00:44:21.972]  Obamacare is sucking up to 10% of Americans' incomes.
[00:44:23.374 --> 00:44:26.977]  The FBI wants Austin residents to be on high alert, but there's no specific threat.
[00:44:26.977 --> 00:44:29.719]  Really, the open borders and all the jihadis being brought in.
[00:44:29.719 --> 00:44:33.002]  TSA hit with lawsuit after Nixon body scanner opt-out.
[00:44:33.002 --> 00:44:34.623]  We'll be getting into that.
[00:44:34.623 --> 00:44:37.945]  TSA quietly moves to make body scanners mandatory.
[00:44:37.945 --> 00:44:39.166]  And they're going to go on the streets next.
[00:44:39.166 --> 00:44:42.649]  I'm going to get into that after the break.
[00:44:42.649 --> 00:44:44.791]  But I kind of got into this story and went off on that jag.
[00:44:44.791 --> 00:44:46.732]  The cashless society cometh.
[00:44:46.732 --> 00:44:50.055]  European nations such as Sweden and Denmark are eradicating cash.
[00:44:51.465 --> 00:44:57.347]  And they're also creating internal checkpoints, and if you criticize any radical Muslims, you get arrested.
[00:44:57.347 --> 00:45:08.112]  And now another region, Corsica of Italy, has banned all rallies following a series of violent anti-Muslim protests, because they brought hundreds of thousands into Corsica alone.
[00:45:09.471 --> 00:45:13.373]  And they're attacking and raping people, so folks fought back, so just free speech is banned.
[00:45:13.373 --> 00:45:16.774]  Just like in France and Germany, they use a threat to then ban our speech.
[00:45:16.774 --> 00:45:20.135]  As I said with Benghazi, they're going to ship all the weapons in, attack Europe.
[00:45:20.135 --> 00:45:22.056]  When they do, they're going to take all of our rights.
[00:45:22.056 --> 00:45:24.377]  And then ban criticizing the radical Muslims.
[00:45:24.377 --> 00:45:27.358]  That's the response.
[00:45:27.358 --> 00:45:29.479]  Again, because the globalists are bringing down the West.
[00:45:29.479 --> 00:45:31.360]  They've already brought down the Middle East, Africa.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:38.923]  They want to bring everything down except for their golden fields, their Elysiums, their controlled sectors.
[00:45:40.814 --> 00:45:44.216]  Can you guys queue up Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement?
[00:45:44.216 --> 00:45:45.817]  Just go to YouTube.
[00:45:45.817 --> 00:45:48.459]  Endgame.
[00:45:48.459 --> 00:46:00.606]  And I want to play the first five minutes or so.
[00:46:00.606 --> 00:46:05.609]  This film was made like eight and a half, nine years ago and then you watch it, people watch it and they go, oh yeah, this is all happened.
[00:46:06.628 --> 00:46:07.609]  What, did this come out this year?
[00:46:07.609 --> 00:46:10.471]  And they go, oh my God, no, this is nine years old.
[00:46:10.471 --> 00:46:13.253]  No, this didn't come out this year.
[00:46:13.253 --> 00:46:18.518]  And so you watch it and you go, oh yeah, this has all pretty much happened.
[00:46:18.518 --> 00:46:22.821]  It's all being announced.
[00:46:22.821 --> 00:46:25.183]  That's how stupid they think you are.
[00:46:25.183 --> 00:46:26.984]  And I'm not here to make anybody scared, folks.
[00:46:26.984 --> 00:46:28.386]  This is already going on.
[00:46:28.386 --> 00:46:31.088]  You might as well say no to it and say you're not going to go along with it.
[00:46:32.165 --> 00:46:38.649]  I mean, you think Bank of America want to charge you $5 every time you make a transaction on your credit card or bank debit card is bad?
[00:46:38.649 --> 00:46:42.071]  That's nothing when they're done with you.
[00:46:42.071 --> 00:46:45.774]  This is about total control.
[00:46:45.774 --> 00:46:47.275]  Let's continue with some of the headlines.
[00:46:47.275 --> 00:46:48.316]  Czech President!
[00:46:48.316 --> 00:46:52.999]  We are facing an organized invasion and not spontaneous movement of refugees.
[00:46:52.999 --> 00:46:53.679]  That's right.
[00:46:53.679 --> 00:46:56.321]  And it's coordinated by Angela Merkel and the EU.
[00:46:59.036 --> 00:47:00.997]  Confessions of an ISIS soldier.
[00:47:00.997 --> 00:47:02.518]  The training took place in Turkey.
[00:47:02.518 --> 00:47:03.999]  Tell us something we didn't know.
[00:47:03.999 --> 00:47:04.940]  Berlin, Germany.
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:05.580]  I am a Muslim.
[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:06.141]  What are you?
[00:47:06.141 --> 00:47:10.604]  Muslims beat Christians for Christmas fun all over the country.
[00:47:10.604 --> 00:47:11.905]  They're asked, are you a Muslim?
[00:47:11.905 --> 00:47:12.725]  If not, you are.
[00:47:12.725 --> 00:47:13.726]  Knockout game.
[00:47:13.726 --> 00:47:15.227]  And the Germans are politically correct.
[00:47:15.227 --> 00:47:18.389]  They submit and literally roll over in fetal positions.
[00:47:18.389 --> 00:47:20.550]  That's good!
[00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:21.871]  They have been trained well.
[00:47:25.592 --> 00:47:30.413]  Iraq troops close to capturing Maramadi from ISIS.
[00:47:30.413 --> 00:47:37.735]  And so Turkey's been responding by, of course, sending in, well, they've invaded Iraq and have been attacking the Iraqi military.
[00:47:37.735 --> 00:47:39.655]  Oh, but they're not with ISIS, no!
[00:47:39.655 --> 00:47:44.916]  You want to know what I really get concerned about, though?
[00:47:44.916 --> 00:47:48.396]  There's two stories here that tie together.
[00:47:48.396 --> 00:47:50.977]  Gonorrhea could become untreatable.
[00:47:52.841 --> 00:47:54.322]  That's right.
[00:47:54.322 --> 00:47:57.664]  In most cases, the antibiotics aren't working anymore.
[00:47:57.664 --> 00:48:11.111]  But that's okay, because I have a BBC News article here where diseases that were thought cured are back.
[00:48:11.111 --> 00:48:12.852]  Here it is.
[00:48:12.852 --> 00:48:13.732]  This is CNN.
[00:48:13.732 --> 00:48:16.334]  Disease resurgence!
[00:48:16.334 --> 00:48:16.414]  Oh!
[00:48:18.126 --> 00:48:23.470]  Scurvy, because folks don't know to eat any vitamin C. That's how debilitated and dumb everybody is.
[00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:26.032]  I see people all over the place with just skin falling off their arms.
[00:48:26.032 --> 00:48:27.773]  And I go, Harry, did your teeth all just fall out?
[00:48:27.773 --> 00:48:29.914]  Yeah, they fell out a year ago.
[00:48:29.914 --> 00:48:40.242]  You need to, you need to, you need to, you know, get vitamin C. And they go, I drink fruit juice, sun-kissed, orange-flavored pop.
[00:48:40.919 --> 00:48:44.442]  They'll look at you with their tongue going, with their teeth loose.
[00:48:44.442 --> 00:48:50.808]  I used to work as a dental assistant in college, and I would see them coming by, and I would say, yes, this is scurvy.
[00:48:50.808 --> 00:48:52.749]  And I'd say, but that doesn't exist anymore.
[00:48:52.749 --> 00:48:54.190]  He goes, no, it's widespread.
[00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:56.372]  I try to tell them, but they don't listen.
[00:48:56.372 --> 00:48:58.634]  There'd be people in there 25, 30, 40, 50, 60.
[00:48:58.634 --> 00:49:00.316]  It gets worse as you get older.
[00:49:00.316 --> 00:49:03.539]  People don't absorb the nutrients anymore.
[00:49:03.539 --> 00:49:06.501]  And I tell them, you need to eat vegetables.
[00:49:06.501 --> 00:49:07.362]  I don't like them!
[00:49:11.684 --> 00:49:13.986]  Of course, we've told you a lot about how scurvy is widespread.
[00:49:13.986 --> 00:49:14.986]  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:49:14.986 --> 00:49:16.467]  You don't need vitamin C, I forgot.
[00:49:16.467 --> 00:49:17.968]  Another conspiracy theory.
[00:49:17.968 --> 00:49:19.029]  I'm sorry.
[00:49:19.029 --> 00:49:21.591]  You do need fluoride.
[00:49:21.591 --> 00:49:23.472]  Vitamin F, as in F-U.
[00:49:23.472 --> 00:49:30.377]  Oh, cholera's up 300 percent, a nice third world disease in the U.S.
[00:49:30.377 --> 00:49:31.578]  Oh, and guess what else?
[00:49:31.578 --> 00:49:32.839]  Oh, drug immune.
[00:49:32.839 --> 00:49:33.980]  You cannot be treated TB.
[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:39.322]  Oh, oh, we'd complain about Latin America and all that pouring in?
[00:49:39.322 --> 00:49:42.563]  You know, where millions die every few years and stuff like TB?
[00:49:42.563 --> 00:49:44.524]  No problem, we're gonna get it now.
[00:49:44.524 --> 00:49:46.705]  Because, you know, the Statue of Liberty!
[00:49:46.705 --> 00:49:51.327]  I'll tell you what, Alex, if you don't wanna scream, if you wanna scream, people, get rid of the Statue of Liberty!
[00:49:51.327 --> 00:50:02.973]  And I'm like, Jesse, they kept you for three to six months at Ellis Island to make sure you didn't have TB, or the Black Plague.
[00:50:02.973 --> 00:50:03.613]  See how that works?
[00:50:05.575 --> 00:50:08.056]  See how that works?
[00:50:08.056 --> 00:50:10.338]  And now it's just spreading everywhere.
[00:50:10.338 --> 00:50:13.520]  Oh, gonorrhea.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:15.601]  You see, the elite just don't care.
[00:50:15.601 --> 00:50:18.522]  They don't care.
[00:50:18.522 --> 00:50:23.105]  They don't tell you when they give your one-year-old that flu shot that it's on the insert.
[00:50:23.105 --> 00:50:27.648]  It can fry their pancreas and give them what they're gonna call type 1 diabetes.
[00:50:27.648 --> 00:50:31.029]  They're gonna tell you it's genetic.
[00:50:31.029 --> 00:50:32.350]  Well, it's like saying, yeah, it's genetic.
[00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:33.611]  If you cut somebody's head off, they die.
[00:50:36.152 --> 00:50:36.873]  Nobody's gonna tell ya.
[00:50:36.873 --> 00:50:39.495]  You gotta look it up yourself.
[00:50:39.495 --> 00:50:46.322]  Look at this man walks off cliff and plummets 60 feet to his death on Christmas Day while distracted by his cell phone.
[00:50:46.322 --> 00:50:47.783]  I see this all the time.
[00:50:47.783 --> 00:50:54.930]  See these stories all tie together because they won't even save themselves because they're in such a trance they don't even know it.
[00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:55.590]  We'll be back.
[00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:56.051]  Stay with us.
[00:50:59.861 --> 00:51:02.604]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[00:51:02.604 --> 00:51:06.068]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:10.792]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[00:51:10.792 --> 00:51:16.214]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[00:51:16.214 --> 00:51:17.715]  How is this even possible?
[00:51:17.715 --> 00:51:25.238]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[00:51:25.238 --> 00:51:32.901]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[00:51:32.901 --> 00:51:36.103]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[00:51:36.383 --> 00:51:44.187]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[00:51:44.187 --> 00:51:47.348]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[00:51:47.348 --> 00:51:51.470]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:52.170]  That's Greens75.com.

[00:52:58.433 --> 00:53:02.655]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:53:02.655 --> 00:53:03.295]  It's true.
[00:53:03.295 --> 00:53:07.437]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:53:07.437 --> 00:53:09.838]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:53:09.838 --> 00:53:14.300]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:27.485]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.

[00:53:49.049 --> 00:53:50.350]  For the love of clean water.
[00:54:14.475 --> 00:54:16.199]  Alright, I have covered maybe 10 stories.
[00:54:16.199 --> 00:54:20.929]  I've probably got, I don't know, 150, 160 or more left.
[00:54:20.929 --> 00:54:24.857]  We've got Steve Quayle joining us with the latest attacks on Trump.
[00:54:26.863 --> 00:54:29.765]  Donald Trump takes aim at Bill Clinton for sexism.
[00:54:29.765 --> 00:54:34.708]  We've told you that he's going to go after them on the rape, on the rest of it.
[00:54:34.708 --> 00:54:40.772]  If they want to attack Donald Trump as a 9-11 truther, Trump is ready to let them attack first, and then he's going to destroy them.
[00:54:40.772 --> 00:54:43.633]  You notice they started attacking him coming on and then dropped it real fast.
[00:54:43.633 --> 00:54:45.174]  They figured it out.
[00:54:45.174 --> 00:54:51.218]  And then, now that that's already happened, and I know they're watching a little closer, that's good!
[00:54:51.218 --> 00:54:52.879]  Good, you're learning New World Order.
[00:54:52.879 --> 00:54:54.100]  You're learning CIA.
[00:54:59.421 --> 00:55:05.344]  All the young little socialists and snot noses at the new CIA think you're going to beat the old CIA.
[00:55:05.344 --> 00:55:07.945]  You're pretty stupid.
[00:55:07.945 --> 00:55:13.067]  And I'm not affiliated with the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:55:13.067 --> 00:55:16.509]  The point is, we are 2.0 Americana.
[00:55:16.509 --> 00:55:19.110]  InfoWars is here to defend the Republic.
[00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:26.894]  If all these federal agencies want to be overrun by foreign interest and sell the country down the road, there's going to be people that are going to oppose you.
[00:55:26.894 --> 00:55:27.374]  Period.
[00:55:28.356 --> 00:55:32.218]  Have you figured that out yet?
[00:55:32.218 --> 00:55:36.180]  But the folks advising Trump are smart.
[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:40.143]  Real smart.
[00:55:40.143 --> 00:55:41.163]  They've judged the public.
[00:55:41.163 --> 00:55:42.104]  They know what's going on.
[00:55:42.104 --> 00:55:45.185]  The only question is, is Trump completely real?
[00:55:45.185 --> 00:55:47.127]  Compared to Hillary, he is.
[00:55:47.127 --> 00:55:51.729]  Compared to Bernie Sanders or Jeb Bush, he is.
[00:55:51.729 --> 00:55:56.192]  Everybody loves to pile on Trump and exaggerate what he said or take it out of context.
[00:55:56.192 --> 00:55:56.712]  I'm not doing it.
[00:56:03.735 --> 00:56:08.916]  Now, continuing, we're going to get into what's happening in the economy.
[00:56:08.916 --> 00:56:13.318]  We're going to get into more of what I mentioned with the TSA.
[00:56:13.318 --> 00:56:19.939]  Coming back with the naked body scanners, and now they want to put them in malls and on highways and everywhere else, while the border stays wide open.
[00:56:19.939 --> 00:56:28.822]  That's like saying, leave the castle gates open, bring in the enemy, but then search the castle guards' wives when they're in the bathroom.
[00:56:33.141 --> 00:56:34.377]  That's all coming up as well.
[00:56:36.641 --> 00:56:46.343]  Now, I want to spend a few minutes on this first, and it's both a news announcement, but it's also a plug for the operation, a great way for you to fund the InfoWar.
[00:56:46.343 --> 00:56:49.263]  This obviously is one of the slowest times of the year in January.
[00:56:49.263 --> 00:56:53.784]  This is one of the reasons why we end up losing money in the first part of a new year.
[00:56:53.784 --> 00:56:54.704]  I don't want to do that.
[00:56:54.704 --> 00:57:00.745]  I want to be able to fund this operation, hire more people, do more, be more effective, not just stay the same size or contract.
[00:57:00.745 --> 00:57:03.986]  You need to buy the products at InfoWarStore.com so that we can
[00:57:04.446 --> 00:57:07.428]  Have the financial provisioning we need in this war.
[00:57:07.428 --> 00:57:08.329]  This is a war.
[00:57:08.329 --> 00:57:09.730]  And they're great products.
[00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:11.070]  Very competitively priced.
[00:57:11.070 --> 00:57:12.031]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:12.031 --> 00:57:13.972]  Look at this headline.
[00:57:13.972 --> 00:57:16.374]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:57:16.374 --> 00:57:17.175]  Number of the week.
[00:57:17.175 --> 00:57:20.717]  Billions in gift cards go unspent.
[00:57:20.717 --> 00:57:22.438]  Billions and billions a year.
[00:57:22.438 --> 00:57:23.679]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:57:23.679 --> 00:57:26.541]  Governments grab unused gift cards.
[00:57:26.541 --> 00:57:28.182]  They just grab the digital money after a year.
[00:57:29.972 --> 00:57:31.813]  Other states do it as well.
[00:57:31.813 --> 00:57:32.594]  Here's another report.
[00:57:32.594 --> 00:57:35.937]  Gift card balance, use it or lose it.
[00:57:35.937 --> 00:57:41.401]  Even if you've forgotten about the gift card balance, that doesn't mean retailers and state governments have.
[00:57:41.401 --> 00:57:49.847]  That's why they love gift cards, because around 30% of the time on average in the United States, it varies in other countries, people don't use the gift card.
[00:57:49.847 --> 00:57:52.529]  They forget about it.
[00:57:52.529 --> 00:57:56.533]  Well, all I'm saying is, fund the Infowar, get high quality nutraceuticals,
[00:57:57.628 --> 00:58:03.095]  And Infowarslife.com, like the X2, or Super Male or Super Female, I mean, just try it.
[00:58:03.095 --> 00:58:05.398]  You've heard the rave reviews.
[00:58:05.398 --> 00:58:07.121]  4.8 stars in third-party sites.
[00:58:07.121 --> 00:58:09.103]  I mean, this really is amazing.
[00:58:09.103 --> 00:58:11.266]  The Deep Cleanse, I mean, just scores of products.
[00:58:11.266 --> 00:58:11.847]  Brain Force.
[00:58:12.608 --> 00:58:15.529]  I was talking to a top formulator just last week and they said, man, that's a great formula.
[00:58:15.529 --> 00:58:16.690]  And I was like, of course it is.
[00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:19.171]  We wanted to have the best at the lowest price.
[00:58:19.171 --> 00:58:20.471]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:20.471 --> 00:58:22.112]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:22.112 --> 00:58:29.395]  Use your gift cards from Christmas right through New Year's to support the InfoWar and get 15% off the entire store.
[00:58:29.395 --> 00:58:35.378]  Use promo code GIFTFIFTEEN at checkout and get 15% off the entire store when you use any gift card.
[00:58:36.451 --> 00:58:37.391]  Take advantage of it.
[00:58:37.391 --> 00:58:43.334]  Infowarsstore.com and know you're funding a titanous force against tyranny.
[00:58:43.334 --> 00:58:45.335]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:57.412 --> 00:58:59.753]  The best-selling single of all time.
[00:58:59.753 --> 00:59:03.255]  In excess of a hundred million copies sold worldwide.
[00:59:03.255 --> 00:59:10.879]  But our college kids, raised in a narrative of white privilege and microaggression, think it's an offense to people of color.
[00:59:10.879 --> 00:59:17.142]  It's insulting to people of color, perpetuates the idea that white is naturally good, and that other colors are bad.
[00:59:17.142 --> 00:59:19.883]  And we feel that that's a microaggression.
[00:59:19.883 --> 00:59:21.964]  Here's a clue, boys and girls.
[00:59:21.964 --> 00:59:23.665]  It's about snow.
[00:59:25.526 --> 00:59:38.050]  The government educational establishment is destroying any connection to existing culture so that they can create a new political culture, one of censorship and intolerance done in the name of tolerance.
[00:59:38.050 --> 00:59:39.230]  Fight back.
[00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:40.731]  Give the gift of knowledge.
[00:59:40.731 --> 00:59:44.992]  Send your friends to InfoWars, the cure for political correctness.
[00:59:44.992 --> 00:59:46.853]  And tell them Merry Christmas.
[00:59:51.670 --> 01:00:04.013]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.013 --> 01:00:13.635]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:17.945 --> 01:00:22.066]  One of the top stories on InfoWars.com.
[01:00:22.066 --> 01:00:29.867]  In the national poll, a large percentage of Democrats think that Donald Trump is worse than ISIS.
[01:00:48.097 --> 01:00:55.521]  But they love Barack Obama, who you can clearly say is the commander of ISIS.
[01:00:55.521 --> 01:01:12.531]  But the fairy godmother that delivers the magic beams in the form of high-impact tow missiles and stinger missiles and other goodies left in the stockings of her little goblins, ISIS, al-Nusra, al-Qaeda.
[01:01:12.531 --> 01:01:14.032]  Hillary Clinton is the fairy godmother.
[01:01:17.492 --> 01:01:24.794]  And now these headlines, legal experts cite Islamic State as a reason to get rid of people's free speech.
[01:01:24.794 --> 01:01:28.475]  See, we have to conform to radical Islam.
[01:01:28.475 --> 01:01:35.637]  We have to give our rights up, because we're bad.
[01:01:35.637 --> 01:01:45.680]  But now the New York Times has blamed Saddam Hussein for creating ISIS, even though it's the very group he fought out of Saudi Arabia.
[01:01:46.516 --> 01:01:57.160]  Unless Saudi Arabia was involved in 9-11 to blame Iraq so they could be brought down and install the caliphate in Iraq.
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:10.966]  But the New York Times comes out and they blame Donald Trump and they blame Saddam Hussein, people who had nothing to do with ISIS,
[01:02:15.922 --> 01:02:18.044]  That's what they think of you.
[01:02:18.044 --> 01:02:22.047]  Oh my gosh, I've run into people that go, you read the New York Times?
[01:02:22.047 --> 01:02:22.948]  So-called intellectuals.
[01:02:22.948 --> 01:02:34.217]  I mean, they'll see you reading it on an iPad at a coffee shop, or they'll see you walking with a copy of it under your arms.
[01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:35.158]  This has happened a few times.
[01:02:35.158 --> 01:02:36.800]  They go, oh, the New York Times, ooh.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:44.006]  See, they go to these movies, these so-called liberal intellectual events to feel.
[01:02:45.563 --> 01:02:52.786]  Like they're intellectual, and the most dry, boring, ironic movies.
[01:02:52.786 --> 01:03:05.450]  I mean, I went and saw Trumbo this weekend, hailed, and of course it has a great actor in it, and it's an interesting movie, but I mean, the victims, oh, the blacklist, oh, and they couldn't write.
[01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:10.512]  And of course the blacklist was bad from an Americana perspective.
[01:03:10.512 --> 01:03:13.153]  And I wouldn't restrict people's free speech to write.
[01:03:14.633 --> 01:03:19.115]  But did they kill 150 million people like communists?
[01:03:19.115 --> 01:03:24.158]  Communists, during that blacklist, had already killed about 100 million people.
[01:03:24.158 --> 01:03:26.159]  And folks were scared over here.
[01:03:26.159 --> 01:03:30.282]  The whole movie attacked John Wayne, made him to be a devil.
[01:03:30.282 --> 01:03:34.664]  Oh, I'm sorry a couple hundred writers got blacklisted from big studios.
[01:03:34.664 --> 01:03:36.385]  I mean, I actually am.
[01:03:36.385 --> 01:03:39.907]  But you would think that they had hung on the cross by Christ.
[01:03:42.264 --> 01:03:52.171]  When I've been around these leftists, these types, and man, they talk about putting patriots and Christians and people in forced labor camps, and every time they get control, they do, and they are nasty.
[01:03:52.171 --> 01:03:53.692]  They are nasty.
[01:03:53.692 --> 01:04:00.497]  They've got a lot of well-meaning leftists that follow along behind them.
[01:04:00.497 --> 01:04:05.240]  But, oh my gosh, two hundred and something of you didn't get the right screenplays for a decade?
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.002]  And some of you even lost your houses?
[01:04:08.002 --> 01:04:08.743]  Wow!
[01:04:08.743 --> 01:04:16.232]  I can play a clip of MSNBC going, of course the IRS is going after the Tea Party and Christian groups and stuff and indicting people.
[01:04:16.232 --> 01:04:16.973]  You're a racist!
[01:04:16.973 --> 01:04:17.854]  You deserve it!
[01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:21.298]  They get up there and they go, we're coming after you with the IRS!
[01:04:21.298 --> 01:04:22.559]  Ha ha ha!
[01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:23.560]  We're gonna get ya!
[01:04:24.855 --> 01:04:27.036]  We're going to sic homeland security on you.
[01:04:27.036 --> 01:04:29.017]  We're going to take your free speech.
[01:04:29.017 --> 01:04:33.978]  We're not going to hand out one tax exemption to Christian groups that are conservative the last four years.
[01:04:33.978 --> 01:04:35.319]  We're going to run your life.
[01:04:35.319 --> 01:04:36.399]  We're going to come after you.
[01:04:36.399 --> 01:04:40.361]  We're going to ship guns into Mexico to blame you for it.
[01:04:40.361 --> 01:04:43.402]  We're going to engage in all the stuff that makes Nixon look like an angel.
[01:04:43.402 --> 01:04:46.403]  But it's okay, because the left's behind it.
[01:04:46.403 --> 01:04:49.064]  I mean, exactly what they do everywhere else.
[01:04:50.629 --> 01:04:57.994]  But they're these little egalitarian, humanitarian sweethearts that are going to protect us from John Wayne.
[01:04:59.158 --> 01:05:05.600]  A Syrian refugee admitted his main goal is not to escape war or ISIS persecution, but to convert Europeans to Islam.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.421]  He said, quote, And he's not the only one.
[01:05:07.421 --> 01:05:13.543]  Influential Shiite recently gave a speech in which he encouraged radical Muslims to use the migrant crisis to, quote, breed with Europeans and conquer their countries.
[01:05:26.667 --> 01:05:30.330]  But this modern-day Islamic conquest is not just happening only in Europe.
[01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:37.056]  Here in the U.S., radical Muslims are building their own Islamic compounds and communities, while telling Christians and other non-Muslims to keep out.
[01:05:37.056 --> 01:05:39.297]  And these communities are rapidly expanding.
[01:05:39.297 --> 01:05:43.641]  In fact, the Obama administration has admitted nearly 400 Syrian refugees into the U.S.
[01:05:43.641 --> 01:05:45.923]  since the November 13th Paris attacks.
[01:05:45.923 --> 01:05:47.604]  And only one of them is a Christian.
[01:05:47.604 --> 01:05:50.607]  But Christians comprise about 10% of the population in Syria.
[01:05:50.607 --> 01:05:54.670]  So why isn't the Obama administration allowing more Christian refugees into the U.S.?
[01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:55.511]  I'll let you decide.
[01:05:55.791 --> 01:05:59.272]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com.

[01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:02.302]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:07:02.302 --> 01:07:10.526]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:15.949]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:07:36.994 --> 01:07:40.295]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:07:40.295 --> 01:07:43.776]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:07:43.776 --> 01:07:45.756]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:07:45.756 --> 01:07:47.877]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:07:47.877 --> 01:07:49.857]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[01:08:06.744 --> 01:08:10.813]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:08:10.813 --> 01:08:12.557]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.157 --> 01:08:25.019]  The desert's quiet.
[01:08:25.019 --> 01:08:27.681]  Cleveland's cold.
[01:08:27.681 --> 01:08:31.563]  So the story ends, we're told.
[01:08:31.563 --> 01:08:33.804]  Another great Texan wrote this song.
[01:08:33.804 --> 01:08:35.565]  Townes Van Zandt.
[01:08:35.565 --> 01:08:36.646]  Sung by Merle Haggard.
[01:08:36.646 --> 01:08:37.927]  And now he's grown old.
[01:08:56.363 --> 01:08:57.763]  There's a little Willie Nelson right there.
[01:08:57.763 --> 01:09:09.245]  Willie Nelson in his prime, the 1980s.
[01:09:09.245 --> 01:09:14.286]  There's a paradox happening worldwide right now.
[01:09:14.286 --> 01:09:24.148]  Because as evil rises, as tyranny unclogs itself, many people who've been in denial are now deciding to actually serve evil.
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:43.047]  Many people are now swearing allegiance to world government, swearing allegiance to anti-human eugenics, swearing allegiance to GMOs, swearing allegiance to fluoride, swearing allegiance to forced inoculation, swearing allegiance to Obamacare, even if it's admittedly there to double and triple prices and screw them over.
[01:09:44.841 --> 01:09:53.828]  People are doubling down on the fraud, but still, in even greater numbers, they're awakening and pledging to stand against it, but asking, what do we do?
[01:09:53.828 --> 01:10:03.895]  How do we attack a false paradigm, a false culture, a false economy, a system designed to envelop us?
[01:10:03.895 --> 01:10:08.578]  You go back to the great labors, an allegory, of Hercules.
[01:10:08.578 --> 01:10:13.642]  He had defeated all these great beasts and monsters and finally had to go into the underworld.
[01:10:14.718 --> 01:10:16.339]  But in the underworld, he couldn't see anything.
[01:10:16.339 --> 01:10:18.379]  It was darkness.
[01:10:18.379 --> 01:10:21.380]  And suddenly, his strength was used against him.
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:26.242]  How did Hercules finish that greatest of works?
[01:10:26.242 --> 01:10:30.524]  Greatest of labors?
[01:10:30.524 --> 01:10:35.265]  My friends, we have to recognize that we're under attack.
[01:10:35.265 --> 01:10:39.607]  We have to understand how real it is, or we don't have any hope.
[01:10:41.963 --> 01:10:43.443]  And there is a lot of good news.
[01:10:43.443 --> 01:10:44.884]  World government's being admitted.
[01:10:44.884 --> 01:10:49.445]  The fact that carbon taxes are meant to shut down society and make the elite even richer is coming out.
[01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:52.586]  The fact that fluoride's killing people is all over mainstream news.
[01:10:52.586 --> 01:11:00.509]  As more and more scientist groups at the British Ministry of Health Service, in our own FDA and EPA say, take it out.
[01:11:00.509 --> 01:11:04.650]  I read that article on Engardian last hour.
[01:11:04.650 --> 01:11:08.171]  They'd make fun of you about bisphenol A ten years ago.
[01:11:08.171 --> 01:11:09.612]  Now they're taking it out of the products.
[01:11:10.848 --> 01:11:17.335]  The truth is, voting with our conscience, voting with our dollars, voting with our feet, voting with our actions, is the power we have.
[01:11:17.335 --> 01:11:20.738]  And that's why they want the cashless society control grid.
[01:11:20.738 --> 01:11:26.564]  That's why big banks are announcing, we're not going to let you have cash, you can't use cash in Europe, the US.
[01:11:26.564 --> 01:11:30.267]  Companies are saying, we won't even take a 20, if you go to places like Target.
[01:11:31.158 --> 01:11:36.180]  Because they want to track and control everything and they want to shut down small cash businesses.
[01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:37.501]  They want to shut down Amish.
[01:11:37.501 --> 01:11:39.442]  They want to shut down farmers markets.
[01:11:39.442 --> 01:11:42.183]  They want to shut down people selling raw milk.
[01:11:42.183 --> 01:11:49.426]  They want to shut down normal human stability and sustainability under sustainability.
[01:11:49.426 --> 01:11:52.267]  Everything's the opposite with them.
[01:11:52.267 --> 01:11:56.309]  Steve Quayle is going to be joining us 20 minutes to the next hour, getting into his view of what's happening in the world.
[01:11:57.446 --> 01:11:59.467]  Superbugs are intensifying, you name it.
[01:11:59.467 --> 01:12:06.408]  We're going to talk about the real threats going into 2016 and what he expects the globalists to do.
[01:12:06.408 --> 01:12:11.350]  It is such good news, though, that our own military is continuing to say no.
[01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:14.510]  Cy Hirsch reported last week what we told you years ago.
[01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:20.012]  The Pentagon's been leaking intelligence to the Syrians and now to the Russians.
[01:12:20.012 --> 01:12:24.093]  The article said that with Dempsey leaving as the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, that stopped.
[01:12:24.093 --> 01:12:24.933]  It did not stop.
[01:12:27.119 --> 01:12:30.762]  And people were intimidated before by the NSA and being indicted.
[01:12:30.762 --> 01:12:40.972]  But what the government's doing is so criminal that top brass and even low-level people are doing things that previously they would have gotten in trouble for that they don't care if they get in trouble now.
[01:12:40.972 --> 01:12:47.218]  And in that, the establishment has run into a dead end because people aren't intimidated anymore to the same extent.
[01:12:47.478 --> 01:13:04.745]  Because the military realizes there is no future if they don't say no, because they're getting ready to let ISIS launch terror attacks all over the West, and then use that to ban the free speech of Christians, conservatives, libertarians, and veterans, and they've done it in Europe, declaring martial law from Italy to Germany to France!
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:10.481]  They call it civil emergency in England, where you can't criticize radical Islam.
[01:13:10.481 --> 01:13:12.041]  You can't criticize communists.
[01:13:12.041 --> 01:13:14.202]  You can't go out and demonstrate if you're a Christian.
[01:13:14.202 --> 01:13:22.424]  Even the Bishop of Canterbury, who is not a conservative, came out and said Christians are being exterminated worldwide because it's happening.
[01:13:22.424 --> 01:13:29.886]  And our normalcy bias is so insane that we sit here and know it's happening and do nothing.
[01:13:29.886 --> 01:13:30.826]  And I understand why.
[01:13:30.826 --> 01:13:31.466]  What do you do?
[01:13:34.184 --> 01:13:38.365]  I've built a media operation that reaches 20 million people a week.
[01:13:38.365 --> 01:13:42.746]  Steve Quayle reaches millions a week and writes books and does what he can to get people thinking outside the box.
[01:13:42.746 --> 01:13:45.787]  But regardless, you've got to start pulling out of their system.
[01:13:45.787 --> 01:13:48.288]  And you've got to criticize their system.
[01:13:48.288 --> 01:13:53.869]  And when the TSA comes out and says we're going to naked body scan you, whether you like it or not, you sue them.
[01:13:53.869 --> 01:13:55.410]  And you go out and you demonstrate.
[01:13:55.410 --> 01:13:59.291]  And you point out it's not the TSA's fault, it's Congress doing it.
[01:13:59.291 --> 01:14:03.252]  Who exempts themselves from the naked body scanners on record, but not citizens.
[01:14:05.011 --> 01:14:10.314]  And it hasn't caught one terrorist, because they leave the borders open and bring them in, so they can use the threat to take our rights.
[01:14:10.314 --> 01:14:17.398]  And if you put up with naked body scanners in the airports, next it's going to be in the shopping malls, which they're calling for.
[01:14:17.398 --> 01:14:19.759]  It's a naked fraud.
[01:14:19.759 --> 01:14:27.403]  You know, I sat out here this last hour, I'm going to play three minutes of it and then go to Steve Quayle, who I appreciate joining us.
[01:14:27.403 --> 01:14:29.444]  Because it illustrates, this film was made in 2007,
[01:14:32.432 --> 01:14:35.274]  That's now 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago.
[01:14:35.274 --> 01:14:36.615]  And you notice the intro to it.
[01:14:36.615 --> 01:14:40.419]  It starts with a few minutes of music and then has the intro about the near future.
[01:14:40.419 --> 01:14:41.720]  Compact cities.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:42.981]  All activity controlled.
[01:14:42.981 --> 01:14:44.022]  Track traced.
[01:14:44.022 --> 01:14:46.343]  This is what they're announcing with the micro apartments.
[01:14:46.343 --> 01:14:49.026]  This is what they're announcing with the driverless cars.
[01:14:49.026 --> 01:14:54.430]  They're announcing the end of humans being able to control our own destiny.
[01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:56.412]  Of prisons being built around us.
[01:14:56.412 --> 01:14:57.593]  Feudalism.
[01:14:57.593 --> 01:15:00.295]  Where if the king doesn't like it, he just shuts the food off.
[01:15:00.295 --> 01:15:01.056]  Total control!
[01:15:03.362 --> 01:15:08.905]  And people think being sycophantic servants of this will protect them, it will ensure your destruction.
[01:15:08.905 --> 01:15:14.909]  I'm gonna skip this one network break coming up so we get this time back to Steve Quayle, but let's go to this clip from Endgame.
[01:15:14.909 --> 01:15:18.631]  That's free online.
[01:15:18.631 --> 01:15:21.933]  We should repost it and say, you know, the film that came true.
[01:15:21.933 --> 01:15:26.456]  Send it out to folks so they understand that most of the film has already come true.
[01:15:26.456 --> 01:15:28.697]  Now do you want the rest of it to come true, folks?
[01:15:28.697 --> 01:15:30.258]  Because where we're being drugged to
[01:15:31.741 --> 01:15:33.162]  It's a very horrible place.
[01:15:33.162 --> 01:15:38.765]  Let's go to the intro to the film.
[01:15:38.765 --> 01:15:44.088]  Countless people hate the New World Order and will die protesting against it.
[01:15:44.088 --> 01:15:44.489]  H.G.
[01:15:44.489 --> 01:15:47.130]  Wells in his book, The New World Order, 1939.
[01:15:47.130 --> 01:16:00.298]  I appeared before the Congressional Committee to tell what I knew of activities which might lead to an attempt to set up a fascist dictatorship.
[01:16:01.283 --> 01:16:07.108]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[01:16:07.108 --> 01:16:12.412]  The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.
[01:16:12.412 --> 01:16:22.601]  And we are as a people, inherently and historically, opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings.
[01:16:22.601 --> 01:16:27.445]  President Bush signed a formal agreement that will end the United States as we know it.
[01:16:27.445 --> 01:16:29.847]  And he took the step without approval from either of the U.S.
[01:16:29.847 --> 01:16:30.107]  Congress.
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:34.001]  The people of the United States.
[01:16:34.001 --> 01:16:37.883]  The secret organizations of the world power elite are no longer secret.
[01:16:37.883 --> 01:16:40.925]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:16:40.925 --> 01:16:45.887]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:16:45.887 --> 01:16:47.128]  I'm Jim Tucker.
[01:16:47.128 --> 01:16:50.789]  I've chased Bilderberg for 30 years.
[01:16:50.789 --> 01:16:52.950]  I'll never give up the chase.
[01:16:52.950 --> 01:17:00.214]  Bilderberg's plan for the whole world is nothing less than world government.
[01:17:01.889 --> 01:17:03.170]  I'm not comfortable with that at all.
[01:17:03.170 --> 01:17:06.451]  Who elected these guys to run the planet?
[01:17:06.451 --> 01:17:08.372]  They are the elitists.
[01:17:08.372 --> 01:17:13.834]  They feel they should run the world for their own selfish interests.
[01:17:13.834 --> 01:17:16.615]  Now we can see a new world coming into view.
[01:17:16.615 --> 01:17:22.678]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[01:17:22.678 --> 01:17:29.401]  Bloomberg is making great progress toward a world government, and only an educated, informed public can stop them in their tracks.
[01:17:33.832 --> 01:17:40.917]  It's good to be back at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:17:40.917 --> 01:17:47.640]  As Pete mentioned, I've been a member for a long time and was actually a director for some period of time.
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:52.343]  I never mentioned that when I was campaigning for re-election back home in Wyoming.
[01:17:52.343 --> 01:17:55.285]  Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories.
[01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:04.533]  I need you to move off the property, please.
[01:18:04.533 --> 01:18:06.976]  It's a trust worth five.
[01:18:06.976 --> 01:18:15.723]  There's mail diverters right there.
[01:18:15.723 --> 01:18:19.266]  The Trans-Texas Corridor is a vital part because we stopped here in Texas.
[01:18:19.266 --> 01:18:24.471]  We stopped the New World Order right here in Texas.
[01:18:24.471 --> 01:18:25.872]  This thing started here.
[01:18:27.797 --> 01:18:31.280]  And to save this country, we kill this damn thing here.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:47.732]  There is a chance for the President of the United States to carry out a phrase his father used, and that is a New World Order.
[01:18:58.838 --> 01:19:01.639]  Your New World Order will fall!
[01:19:01.639 --> 01:19:04.499]  Humanity will defeat you!
[01:19:04.499 --> 01:19:05.459]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[01:19:28.237 --> 01:19:35.165]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:19:35.165 --> 01:19:39.591]  Once free nations are slaves to the will of a tiny elite.
[01:19:39.591 --> 01:19:42.274]  The dawn of a new dark age is upon mankind.
[01:19:43.965 --> 01:19:46.626]  Countries are a thing of the past.
[01:19:46.626 --> 01:19:50.068]  Every form of independence is under attack.
[01:19:50.068 --> 01:19:55.570]  With the family and even the individual itself nearing extinction.
[01:19:55.570 --> 01:20:00.632]  Close to 80% of the Earth's population has been eliminated.
[01:20:00.632 --> 01:20:09.276]  The remnants of a once free humanity are forced to live within highly controlled, compact, prison-like cities.
[01:20:09.276 --> 01:20:10.837]  Travel is highly restricted.
[01:20:12.003 --> 01:20:19.287]  Super highways connect the megacities and keep the population from entering into unauthorized zones.
[01:20:19.287 --> 01:20:22.128]  No human activity is private.
[01:20:22.128 --> 01:20:26.631]  AI supercomputers chronicle and categorize every action.
[01:20:26.631 --> 01:20:33.714]  A prison planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks whose power can never be challenged.
[01:20:33.714 --> 01:20:36.456]  This is the vision of the global elite, their goal.
[01:20:38.155 --> 01:20:43.698]  A program of total dehumanization where the science of tyranny is law.
[01:20:43.698 --> 01:20:50.362]  A worldwide control grid designed to ensure the overlord's monopoly of power forever.
[01:20:50.362 --> 01:20:58.787]  Our species will be condemned to this nightmare future unless the masses are awakened to the New World Order master plan and mobilized to defeat it.
[01:21:01.287 --> 01:21:13.697]  Erected by a secretive group, the Georgia Guidestones are a testament to the elite's plan for a world religion, global laws, with a global court and army to enforce it.
[01:21:13.697 --> 01:21:16.379]  All right, that's like five minutes from my film, Endgame.
[01:21:16.379 --> 01:21:20.402]  And you watch the film, it's free online, that's just from YouTube, so it wasn't that high-res.
[01:21:20.402 --> 01:21:24.365]  We have, obviously, the DVD, and infowarestore.com, and HD.
[01:21:24.365 --> 01:21:27.608]  But it's just important to show people so they know what's going to happen to them.
[01:21:28.308 --> 01:21:31.571]  And then they may not wake up right away, but down the road they'll remember.
[01:21:31.571 --> 01:21:35.394]  And people really need to know exactly what they're facing.
[01:21:35.394 --> 01:21:38.516]  Steve Quayle joins us about 20 minutes into the next hour.
[01:21:38.516 --> 01:21:40.578]  I appreciate Steve Quayle joining us.
[01:21:40.578 --> 01:21:42.439]  Again, he's been a syndicated radio host.
[01:21:42.439 --> 01:21:44.040]  Been on air for about 25 years.
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:45.281]  Best-selling author.
[01:21:45.281 --> 01:21:47.323]  One of the first major survivalists and preppers.
[01:21:47.323 --> 01:21:48.924]  SteveQuayle.com.
[01:21:48.924 --> 01:21:52.307]  Frequent guest, of course, on Coast to Coast AM with George Norrie.
[01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:55.109]  SteveQuayle.com is his site.
[01:21:55.949 --> 01:21:57.510]  Wow, Steve, there's so much to cover.
[01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:58.731]  I just threw out a lot.
[01:21:58.731 --> 01:22:07.818]  I want to cover the entire gambit with you, but first, the ISIS, the terror threats, the arrogance to use the terror that they brought in and then take our rights.
[01:22:07.818 --> 01:22:09.839]  I mean, this is so transparent.
[01:22:09.839 --> 01:22:21.588]  As you know, a big push last week by the Smithsonian and the federal government and NASA admitting that the jet aerosol is from the engines and from the fuel and is terraforming the planet.
[01:22:22.695 --> 01:22:24.756]  Admitting chemtrails last week.
[01:22:24.756 --> 01:22:26.637]  Admitting fluorides killing people this week.
[01:22:26.637 --> 01:22:29.097]  I mean, these are government announcements.
[01:22:29.097 --> 01:22:33.019]  Just a lot of bizarreness going on, good and bad.
[01:22:33.019 --> 01:22:36.040]  So much happening with the stock markets.
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.140]  The year nothing worked.
[01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:39.401]  Stocks, bonds and cash went nowhere this year.
[01:22:39.401 --> 01:22:42.422]  That's a CNBC report.
[01:22:42.422 --> 01:22:45.924]  Czech president talks about the EU with an organized plan to implode the countries.
[01:22:46.884 --> 01:22:55.011]  I mean, it is just an incredible time to be alive right now, and obviously next year most analysts agree it's just going to get more insane.
[01:22:55.011 --> 01:23:00.316]  Steve Quill to break down the real state of the planet, not just the State of the Union, joins us.
[01:23:00.316 --> 01:23:01.517]  Steve Quill, thank you for coming on.
[01:23:02.338 --> 01:23:12.642]  Well, thank you, Alex, and let's just draw everyone's attention to the fact now the voluminous evidence that the United States is the funding source behind ISIS.
[01:23:12.642 --> 01:23:16.423]  It is the provisioning source behind ISIS.
[01:23:16.423 --> 01:23:30.908]  Obviously, we've been caught with our hands in the cookie jar of incredible evil, incredible terror, and it's got to strike a chord, Alex, in every American's heart that we are the ones that are funding the most atrocious
[01:23:31.328 --> 01:23:32.129]  We're good.
[01:23:48.542 --> 01:24:01.618]  The idea is simply this, and this is what I think everyone misses, is that with the entity that's in the White House, we now are seeing the full-scale implementation and Islamic takeover of the United States.
[01:24:01.618 --> 01:24:05.383]  Now, remember this, and I think it's important, Alex, as you and I have detailed,
[01:24:05.983 --> 01:24:12.787]  After World War II, and this is important, the Nazis dissembled, if you will.
[01:24:12.787 --> 01:24:14.188]  They scattered throughout the world.
[01:24:14.188 --> 01:24:17.249]  We brought a whole bunch of them in under Operation Paperclip.
[01:24:17.249 --> 01:24:23.733]  And for the record, Alex, you and I were the first two to talk about Marcus Wolf, Nostazi, and Primakov setting up.
[01:24:24.493 --> 01:24:34.319]  Uh, the FEMA data control banks, if you will, and then which led to Facebook and all the other self, if you will, erecting intelligence dossiers.
[01:24:34.319 --> 01:24:39.102]  But this is all the revival of Nazism, and it never left the world.
[01:24:39.102 --> 01:24:43.244]  You and I have talked excessively in our early years on talk radio of who banked it, who
[01:24:43.644 --> 01:24:53.591]  Who the banking families of the United States, banking families of Europe, even George Bush's father and grandfather involved with the Nazis.
[01:24:53.591 --> 01:24:55.253]  But here's the important thing.
[01:24:55.253 --> 01:24:56.233]  Why all of a sudden?
[01:24:56.233 --> 01:24:56.574]  I don't know.
[01:24:56.574 --> 01:25:01.037]  Have you had time to watch Hunting Hitler on the National Geographic Channel?
[01:25:01.037 --> 01:25:05.660]  Yes, and I even know Tim Kennedy, who's the special forces individual out there.
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:06.941]  And I'm not at liberty to say
[01:25:07.882 --> 01:25:25.169]  Some of the things I was told about the show, but clearly they already knew where, I mean Tim didn't know, but Bayer of the CIA and others already knew where they were going, what they were doing, because that's been known by the CIA since then, because they were the ones that let the Nazis go there, and that's even been declassified.
[01:25:26.198 --> 01:25:27.239]  Absolutely.
[01:25:27.239 --> 01:25:54.577]  Now, people have got to ask themselves, why all of a sudden, with actually, you know, 70 years or 70 plus years of a total lockout, and obviously the FBI's files on Hitler, I mean, they knew where he was every step of the way, they knew where Mengele was, they knew where some of the people that basically don't even know these names, but the Germans, in their high technology, in their experiments on humanity, Dr. Mengele, Mengele's twinning, Mengele's cloning,
[01:25:55.515 --> 01:26:13.290]  The fact is that our CIA has been, from day one under Dulles, pretty much, Ellen Dulles, D-U-L-L-E-S, has been pretty much, if you will, a Nazi import, and now we've got the situation going where we're seeing racial purity.
[01:26:13.290 --> 01:26:23.059]  And how many times, Alex, have you talked about everything from Margaret Sanger, Planned Parenthood, you know, the whole idea of the Nazi Society for Racial
[01:26:24.059 --> 01:26:35.621]  Now we're seeing entire groups of people marked for destruction by ISIS, and I promise you, whoever is heading up ISIS, the real heads of it, are just laughing in the face of it.
[01:26:35.621 --> 01:26:39.902]  And let's expand on that, because eugenics came out of England and the United States.
[01:26:39.902 --> 01:26:44.083]  Hitler was a creation of that, so it was just bringing home people they agreed with.
[01:26:44.083 --> 01:26:48.804]  You have to understand, all the real eugenicists were, quote, liberals.
[01:26:49.364 --> 01:26:56.610]  And that's how they sold the idea of the government's gonna take care of you, but it's really so they can run your life and dominate what you do.
[01:26:56.610 --> 01:27:05.997]  And so the 36,000 Nazis brought here on record were used to head up NASA, every major federal agency, you name it, from behind the scenes.
[01:27:06.377 --> 01:27:13.583]  They'd be there 20, 30, 40 years as the shadow directors with other directors in front of them because they had so much dirt on them.
[01:27:13.583 --> 01:27:16.325]  They fully controlled them and the Germans would follow orders.
[01:27:16.325 --> 01:27:19.788]  They're well known for that and are very smart and good at organizing.
[01:27:19.788 --> 01:27:22.030]  You know, that's the cliche, but it's certainly true.
[01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:25.613]  And so from scientific developments, you name it, that all came here.
[01:27:25.613 --> 01:27:33.200]  The shadow government went underground in 1947, used the Nazis as the excuse to keep it all secret because you couldn't tell the public.
[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:40.647]  And so now we have this breakaway civilization they've built, and more and more they're dribbling out what they've constructed.
[01:27:40.647 --> 01:27:41.508]  Here's a question.
[01:27:41.508 --> 01:27:46.493]  Why do you think they're admitting, okay, we shipped the Nazis out of South America?
[01:27:46.493 --> 01:27:49.576]  Okay, yeah, we are spraying you and changing the atmosphere.
[01:27:49.576 --> 01:27:50.177]  Just trust us.
[01:27:50.177 --> 01:27:51.638]  It's for your own good.
[01:27:51.638 --> 01:27:56.924]  I mean, they're just coming out with more and more while simultaneously telling people it doesn't exist.
[01:27:57.844 --> 01:28:01.827]  Well, I think the answer to that is the Illuminati are flat-out Satanists.
[01:28:01.827 --> 01:28:05.369]  They are flat-out Luciferian worshippers.
[01:28:05.369 --> 01:28:12.453]  Hitler, the early years of Hitler in Munich, basically talks about even his wars when the Prince of Hell entered him.
[01:28:12.453 --> 01:28:16.116]  Everybody surrounding Hitler was in a cult, if you will.
[01:28:16.116 --> 01:28:22.900]  The higher-ups in the SS, which by the way, stood for Black Sun, Schwarz und Sonnen, and forgive my German, but the point being...
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:24.300]  By the way, that's all been admitted.
[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:26.541]  That was in the British wartime secret reports.
[01:28:26.541 --> 01:28:34.344]  They were getting the SS castle and trying to channel the devil into Hitler and they had the black magic Tibetan monks there.
[01:28:34.344 --> 01:28:35.984]  I mean, they were whacked out of their minds.
[01:28:35.984 --> 01:28:40.126]  They would cut SS officers' heads off and try to portend the future looking into their eyes.
[01:28:42.054 --> 01:29:00.312]  Well, I think that the idea of now it breaking, let me share this, if people understood the sophistication of human cloning and twinning back even in 1946-47 when Mangala was both in Argentina, Brazil, and every place else around the globe.
[01:29:00.892 --> 01:29:07.255]  If people would study this history, you've got to understand, they who control history control the future.
[01:29:07.255 --> 01:29:21.381]  And Alex, in the book I've just written, It's Gone Wildfire, and this is critical, Empire Beneath the Ice, How the Nazis Won World War II, you cannot prove, outside of all the empiric evidence, that that statement's not true.
[01:29:21.381 --> 01:29:26.723]  You just mentioned our defense and aerospace industry, all of them, Bell Aerospace,
[01:29:27.305 --> 01:29:32.266]  Nassau, Martin Marietta, all the sophisticated top Nazis in the world.
[01:29:32.266 --> 01:29:36.107]  But one of the most famous ones was called Hans Kammler.
[01:29:36.107 --> 01:29:36.867]  K-A-M-M-L-E-R.
[01:29:36.867 --> 01:29:37.267]  Stay there.
[01:29:37.267 --> 01:29:37.967]  Tell us about that.
[01:29:37.967 --> 01:29:43.028]  I want to get back into cloning, too, because they were cloning rabbits back in the 40s, but they suppressed that.
[01:29:43.028 --> 01:29:45.068]  They're cloning everything, folks.
[01:29:45.068 --> 01:29:46.408]  Again, advanced technology.
[01:29:46.408 --> 01:29:48.309]  Stay with us.
[01:29:48.309 --> 01:29:49.709]  We're on the march.

[01:31:59.662 --> 01:32:03.263]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?

[01:33:42.535 --> 01:33:42.915]  800-259-9231.
[01:33:42.915 --> 01:33:47.018]  Steve Quayle is our guest.
[01:33:47.018 --> 01:33:53.042]  He's a multi-time best-selling author.
[01:33:53.042 --> 01:33:55.984]  His newest book is Empire Beneath the Ice.
[01:33:55.984 --> 01:33:59.186]  We'll have him back on another occasion to just get into that specifics.
[01:33:59.186 --> 01:34:01.867]  You can find out more at stevequayle.com.
[01:34:01.867 --> 01:34:02.888]  Now before I go any further,
[01:34:04.091 --> 01:34:11.216]  We are funded by TV viewers and radio listeners that want hardcore information out there and believe in what we're doing.
[01:34:11.216 --> 01:34:13.137]  Or who just believe in folks that promote the First Amendment.
[01:34:13.137 --> 01:34:15.739]  You know, we're here to defend the First Amendment.
[01:34:15.739 --> 01:34:17.340]  It's under attack, not just the Second Amendment.
[01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:19.101]  I have news on that as well.
[01:34:19.101 --> 01:34:28.647]  Very serious gun restrictions being attempted through legislation in Congress now and at the state level and also extrajudicially by shooing gun manufacturers.
[01:34:28.647 --> 01:34:32.010]  So the next big offensive on our guns is here, folks.
[01:34:32.010 --> 01:34:33.631]  The alarm is being raised.
[01:34:35.432 --> 01:34:46.599]  But I noticed I was looking at statistics and I've got Wall Street Journal articles, you name it here, government grabs unused gift cards, billions a year, unused.
[01:34:46.599 --> 01:34:48.681]  Billions in gift cards go unspent.
[01:34:48.681 --> 01:34:50.422]  Again, Wall Street Journal.
[01:34:50.422 --> 01:35:01.889]  And I was thinking, why don't we just say 15% off with anybody using a gift card when you go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:35:01.889 --> 01:35:02.970]  And by the way, folks,
[01:35:04.039 --> 01:35:08.640]  They're all just basically credit cards, so it doesn't matter.
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:10.601]  Everyone can get the 15% off.
[01:35:10.601 --> 01:35:11.561]  That's really what it is.
[01:35:11.561 --> 01:35:15.062]  It's a store-wide sale for 15% and we're going to run it.
[01:35:15.062 --> 01:35:18.183]  That's on top of a bunch of specials that are running.
[01:35:18.183 --> 01:35:31.387]  15% off store-wide, but in an attempt to get people to actually dig through stuff and use that old card before it stops working, usually in about a year, year and a half, the government just takes the money.
[01:35:31.387 --> 01:35:32.727]  Legally, the companies aren't allowed to do it.
[01:35:34.918 --> 01:35:36.339]  Why not use those gift cards?
[01:35:36.339 --> 01:35:43.322]  Why not dig through there and then get Survival Shield X2, the good halogen that blocks the bad halogens and has done so much for my health, and you've heard the rave reviews.
[01:35:43.322 --> 01:35:44.683]  Why not get some Super Mill Vitality?
[01:35:44.683 --> 01:35:47.784]  Why not get some Oxy Powder and flush out your intestines?
[01:35:47.784 --> 01:35:48.284]  Why not?
[01:35:48.284 --> 01:35:53.767]  I mean, these are really the very best products that we could come up with.
[01:35:55.268 --> 01:35:56.870]  Non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:59.413]  The widest selection you'll find anywhere.
[01:35:59.413 --> 01:36:04.438]  We set out to carry all the major quality brands and then have the lowest prices.
[01:36:04.438 --> 01:36:06.821]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:36:06.821 --> 01:36:08.482]  Now's the time to get ready for that spring garden.
[01:36:08.482 --> 01:36:10.244]  You've got to get ready months before.
[01:36:10.244 --> 01:36:11.546]  And you support the broadcast.
[01:36:13.231 --> 01:36:14.672]  Hundreds and hundreds of great items.
[01:36:14.672 --> 01:36:16.873]  By the way, there are a few of the Hillary for Prison shirts left.
[01:36:16.873 --> 01:36:17.974]  It is limited edition.
[01:36:17.974 --> 01:36:19.255]  We're not making any more.
[01:36:19.255 --> 01:36:21.517]  A few sizes are left of those limited edition.
[01:36:21.517 --> 01:36:24.839]  I wish I wouldn't have said it was limited edition because it's such a hot shirt now.
[01:36:24.839 --> 01:36:30.122]  There's this effect where all these beautiful ladies are out on the campaign trail for Donald Trump wearing the shirt.
[01:36:30.122 --> 01:36:33.865]  That trend started when Biggs went to Dallas wearing one and it got a bunch of attention.
[01:36:33.865 --> 01:36:38.408]  So now there's all these different Trump babes.
[01:36:38.408 --> 01:36:40.910]  In fact, I think you guys can just look it up.
[01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:42.631]  Trump babe in Michigan.
[01:36:43.511 --> 01:36:45.412]  Wearing the shirt was a great photo of that.
[01:36:45.412 --> 01:36:47.713]  More and more of that's happening.
[01:36:47.713 --> 01:36:51.134]  A lot of stuff at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:36:51.134 --> 01:36:53.075]  Your purchases make it all possible.
[01:36:53.075 --> 01:36:55.996]  Also, we're running this through to the first of the year.
[01:36:55.996 --> 01:36:59.418]  Six months free to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:10.923]  And so it is your purchase that makes this possible.
[01:37:10.923 --> 01:37:15.607]  And when you get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, normally it's $5.95 a month.
[01:37:15.607 --> 01:37:18.830]  Normally when you get a year, you get like two months off the price.
[01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:20.171]  This is six months off.
[01:37:20.171 --> 01:37:22.454]  We've never done this.
[01:37:22.454 --> 01:37:28.279]  You get it half price and 20 people can use each membership and that just helps us pay for the bandwidth.
[01:37:28.279 --> 01:37:32.083]  It's on Boxee, Roku, cable systems, your smart TVs, everything.
[01:37:32.083 --> 01:37:33.044]  It works basically on everything.
[01:37:34.824 --> 01:37:36.465]  And we just keep adding more and more to it.
[01:37:36.465 --> 01:37:41.369]  So PrisonPlanet.tv and it is your purchases that fund this vital operation.
[01:37:41.369 --> 01:37:42.770]  I cannot stress that enough.
[01:37:42.770 --> 01:37:44.091]  I cannot thank you enough.
[01:37:44.091 --> 01:37:52.737]  And then we become a platform to bring everybody on here from Ron Paul to Matt Drudge to Donald Trump to Steve Quayle to you name it.
[01:37:53.809 --> 01:37:59.574]  And to folks that are successfully suing the TSA and the naked body scanners, we're on the march.
[01:37:59.574 --> 01:38:09.421]  The globalist technocracy is in a lot of trouble, but because it's been able to take our tax money globally, operate in secret under national security, we don't know how big the monstrosity is.
[01:38:09.421 --> 01:38:11.963]  And Steve Quayle gets into some pretty wild stuff.
[01:38:11.963 --> 01:38:18.669]  But I remember him talking about cloning 20 years ago, and I had BBC articles that were saying, oh, we've cloned humans.
[01:38:20.031 --> 01:38:21.775]  But we kill them in utero.
[01:38:21.775 --> 01:38:23.459]  In the uterus.
[01:38:23.459 --> 01:38:23.920]  In utero.
[01:38:24.926 --> 01:38:31.892]  And then I remember reading articles in like 1998 about human clones in the utero of cows.
[01:38:31.892 --> 01:38:38.017]  But they change the human genetics 1% or 2% with chimpanzee or cow or pig.
[01:38:38.017 --> 01:38:40.418]  Usually cow or pig because then it doesn't get rejected.
[01:38:40.418 --> 01:38:42.740]  They grow them in pigs as well, humans.
[01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:44.682]  Is there a debate about do they have rights?
[01:38:44.682 --> 01:38:48.885]  Where is the no clone testing on your bottles of drugs or whatever?
[01:38:48.885 --> 01:38:50.306]  See, there's not even debate about it.
[01:38:50.306 --> 01:38:54.410]  While we're worried about puppy dogs and stuff being tested on, which I'm against as well,
[01:38:56.075 --> 01:38:58.097]  Or guinea pigs.
[01:38:58.097 --> 01:39:05.586]  There's not even a discussion about from Costa Rica to Hong Kong to Beijing, China.
[01:39:05.586 --> 01:39:07.849]  These are some of the worst places.
[01:39:07.849 --> 01:39:12.334]  Massive human cloning going on and they just call it embryonic stem cells.
[01:39:13.527 --> 01:39:17.188]  Just like we told you 20 years ago, they're selling baby parts at Planned Parenthood.
[01:39:17.188 --> 01:39:22.149]  And the word was, sometimes keeping the partial births alive longer so they could be dissected.
[01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:24.509]  That's now coming out at some of the abortuaries.
[01:39:24.509 --> 01:39:27.710]  You see how you couldn't believe it, but we were right.
[01:39:27.710 --> 01:39:34.612]  I told folks five years ago that they were actually heating hospitals in England, as I was told by an insider, with baby parts.
[01:39:34.612 --> 01:39:36.492]  Now it came out in the news two years ago.
[01:39:36.492 --> 01:39:38.352]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[01:39:38.352 --> 01:39:40.593]  And I think that's one problem we have is that
[01:39:41.893 --> 01:39:56.126]  The admitted fantastical stuff, like humans that have been genetically changed so they, quote, don't have rights and don't get rejected, that are then grown in, not artificial uteruses, but in large mammal uteruses, this is what we know is going on.
[01:39:56.126 --> 01:40:07.476]  Thousands of pharmaceutical crops with live viruses in them, merging with plants and animals, frankenfish being put in the ocean, I mean, it's so incredible, it's unbelievable.
[01:40:08.834 --> 01:40:10.414]  But no one will get upset about it.
[01:40:10.414 --> 01:40:17.716]  No one cares about the admissions, but will freak out all day if somebody saw a chupacabra in their backyard with no proof.
[01:40:17.716 --> 01:40:22.618]  And so I don't understand that paradox where, Steve Quayle, I'm not knocking folks to talk about chupacabras.
[01:40:22.618 --> 01:40:26.419]  The point is, we have real spider goats going on for 30 years.
[01:40:26.419 --> 01:40:27.979]  I didn't know about it until 20 years ago.
[01:40:27.979 --> 01:40:31.960]  We have real glow-in-the-dark cats and dogs you can buy in Asia.
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:34.261]  They won't allow it here because they don't want the public to freak out.
[01:40:35.043 --> 01:40:37.065]  You know, they're part jellyfish.
[01:40:37.065 --> 01:40:40.067]  And if a new listener is hearing this, I know it sounds insane, but it's real.
[01:40:40.067 --> 01:40:55.520]  So, Steve Quill, what is this paradox where they admit the Emergency Centers Establishment Act with the FEMA camps, Army.mil says they're preparing to re-educate Americans in them for political beliefs, how they're going to break our families up, but I can't get anybody to go to the document, but they'll
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:02.222]  Some guy shows a train station and says he thinks it's one and it gets 5 million views when it's not.
[01:41:02.222 --> 01:41:09.025]  So then Glenn Beck can say we're making stuff up and show a train station that we didn't say was a FEMA camp, but say we said it's a FEMA camp.
[01:41:09.025 --> 01:41:12.086]  So that's why I try to be careful and only report on what we can prove.
[01:41:12.086 --> 01:41:16.768]  I know the rabbit hole goes a trillion miles deeper, but how do you deal with this paradox?
[01:41:18.183 --> 01:41:24.868]  Well, first of all, you've got to understand that I believe that we are the most mind-controlled population in the world.
[01:41:24.868 --> 01:41:30.392]  I get into that, Alex, in realms I never even touched in my new book, Empire Beneath the Ice.
[01:41:30.392 --> 01:41:31.193]  It's fine.
[01:41:31.193 --> 01:41:32.474]  Let me just share this.
[01:41:32.474 --> 01:41:33.635]  We're talking about this.
[01:41:33.635 --> 01:41:36.537]  Peter Goodgate made a powerful statement.
[01:41:36.537 --> 01:41:39.760]  And a lot of people are asking, why all this Hitler stuff?
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:41.241]  And this will answer your question.
[01:41:41.981 --> 01:41:44.262]  And I'm going to quote Goodgame, one quick paragraph.
[01:41:44.262 --> 01:41:52.844]  The answer to what drove Hitler can be found by examining Hitler's relationship with the occult, his involvement in the dark arts of sorcery and demon or spirit possession.
[01:41:52.844 --> 01:42:06.427]  And then Revelation 17, 8 says, the beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go forth into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names are not written in the book of life on the foundations of the world.
[01:42:07.148 --> 01:42:09.110]  Cloning has been so sophisticated.
[01:42:09.110 --> 01:42:23.711]  One of the things that got me in a lot of trouble years ago, and if it wouldn't have been for some brave guys in Austin, God bless you, those people in Austin know who I'm talking about, would have led to an event where I would no longer be on Alex Jones, my show, or anybody's show.
[01:42:24.415 --> 01:42:26.797]  The advanced cloning, Alex.
[01:42:26.797 --> 01:42:29.639]  I prove, you know this, I footnote everything.
[01:42:29.639 --> 01:42:37.584]  I prove it, but I can't overcome, nor can you overcome, or we overcome, the denial of uncomfortability, okay?
[01:42:38.434 --> 01:42:47.601]  The people want you to be the tip of the spear, want me to be the tip of the spear, the bow of the icebreaker, you know?
[01:42:47.601 --> 01:42:49.003]  And guess what?
[01:42:49.003 --> 01:42:59.111]  If the bow on the icebreaker doesn't hit the ice first, meaning that which stands against it, the rest of the ship, you know, won't be able to make it through the ice.
[01:42:59.111 --> 01:43:01.873]  So we're living in a world of supernatural
[01:43:02.546 --> 01:43:07.651]  demonic, and I believe, a fallen angel infestation, okay?
[01:43:07.651 --> 01:43:14.558]  Remember this, everybody you and I quote in the New World Order, the globalists, all these guys are Luciferians.
[01:43:14.558 --> 01:43:19.944]  To them, Lucifer is more real than Jesus Christ is to the Christians, okay?
[01:43:20.584 --> 01:43:22.226]  No, I'm not saying that's the case.
[01:43:22.226 --> 01:43:27.171]  I'm saying they take their Luciferianism to the nth degree.
[01:43:27.171 --> 01:43:29.673]  I'm talking about baby parts, okay?
[01:43:29.673 --> 01:43:40.985]  This is... Ladies and gentlemen, the Nazis are the ones who provided Margaret Sanger with her intellectual quasi-supernatural evil.
[01:43:41.745 --> 01:43:47.330]  If the devil's goals destroy mankind, Alex, and I believe that's what you believe too... I agree.
[01:43:47.330 --> 01:43:48.671]  They had to betray Hitler.
[01:43:48.671 --> 01:43:49.933]  This is all on record.
[01:43:49.933 --> 01:43:51.754]  Literally, folks, if you look into it.
[01:43:51.754 --> 01:44:08.469]  He had to play the bad cop so America, England, and others could play the good cop with the soft eugenics under the table so that people wouldn't see that Hitler was actually just one expression to be defeated so then their system could come into full power with a global government.
[01:44:08.949 --> 01:44:15.393]  Based on the agreements that were made after World War II for the dollar to be the world reserve currency.
[01:44:15.393 --> 01:44:25.340]  Well, that's true, but remember that in the last days when the Antichrist does show up on the scene, it says that the kings of the earth will give their power unto him.
[01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:26.361]  That's right.
[01:44:26.361 --> 01:44:27.742]  They'll fall down and worship him.
[01:44:27.742 --> 01:44:29.443]  And this is something I've got to say.
[01:44:29.443 --> 01:44:34.026]  The entity in the slaughterhouse, those are my words for the current American policy,
[01:44:35.027 --> 01:44:48.056]  We're seeing now the fulfillment, or forgive me, the inception of the Islamic, if you will, the return of the Mahdi, and that he can only return after World War III.
[01:44:50.606 --> 01:44:53.347]  You know, Alex, people used to say to me, you're crazy, Quayle.
[01:44:53.347 --> 01:44:55.028]  There's not going to be a nuclear war.
[01:44:55.028 --> 01:44:56.448]  Everybody would get us destroyed.
[01:44:56.448 --> 01:44:58.809]  Meanwhile, China moves into Syria.
[01:44:58.809 --> 01:45:00.409]  Russia's there.
[01:45:00.409 --> 01:45:05.551]  We're doing, NATO just moved in its AWACS planes, which is a direct challenge to Vladimir Putin.
[01:45:05.951 --> 01:45:10.174]  Putin's given, I believe, every chance for America to step away.
[01:45:10.174 --> 01:45:13.536]  But there's an unseen hand, Alex, and it is the devil.
[01:45:13.536 --> 01:45:15.357]  It's Luciferianism.
[01:45:15.357 --> 01:45:19.200]  And no matter who you quote, I quote, we can take them in concept.
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:26.985]  How many times over the years you've been on talk radio have you quoted all the population control quotes from everything from Cousteau to Prince Philip?
[01:45:26.985 --> 01:45:27.766]  You name it.
[01:45:27.766 --> 01:45:28.466]  Everybody.
[01:45:28.466 --> 01:45:30.828]  Yet people don't want to admit it.
[01:45:30.828 --> 01:45:32.609]  Now we see the geoengineering.
[01:45:32.609 --> 01:45:35.511]  Remember how much flak I caught when I first broke that story?
[01:45:36.752 --> 01:45:39.033]  And for the record, I'm not taking credit for it.
[01:45:39.033 --> 01:45:39.674]  No, it's true.
[01:45:39.674 --> 01:45:47.620]  You're the first person I remember breaking that there was atmospheric weather manipulation going on with things being added to the fuel to be dispersed by the engines.
[01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:50.162]  You dug out the patents, all of it, absolutely.
[01:45:50.162 --> 01:45:54.886]  You and then also Dr. Nick Begich, I think he came after you.
[01:45:54.886 --> 01:45:55.346]  Right.
[01:45:55.346 --> 01:45:57.148]  Angels don't play this harp.
[01:45:57.148 --> 01:46:01.011]  And the situation is that now we've got Nazi technology.
[01:46:01.011 --> 01:46:02.732]  But here's what I want people to understand.
[01:46:03.556 --> 01:46:09.682]  Dr. Mengele's driving force was to keep the seed of the Fuhrer going.
[01:46:09.682 --> 01:46:26.317]  There's a little town in Brazil that has, I think, 10% of its population, six to seven hundred sets of twins, Claudio Cordei, or Cordei, C-O-D-I-T-I, and I don't speak Spanish, so I apologize for slaughtering that, but the point being is that twinning was
[01:46:27.938 --> 01:46:43.327]  Alex, I've talked to people, I'm sure you have too, and now when every news story on Matt Drudge's site, you know, the point is, is that cloning is so far advanced, and gene editing, and the super soldiers, everything now is coming into play.
[01:46:43.327 --> 01:46:53.372]  And I said to people, I said, when this stuff begins to be implemented on a global scale, it will come from your left side, your right side, it will come from underneath you, it will come from behind you.
[01:46:53.812 --> 01:47:02.914]  And it's basically their idea, same strategy, Clara Piven, is to overwhelm the system and overwhelm the census.
[01:47:02.914 --> 01:47:08.675]  And I believe that America, even more so than any country, has been numbed and dumbed down.
[01:47:08.675 --> 01:47:18.096]  And look, people want to look at sports fine, but entertainment has nourished and blinded the thinking process of most Americans.
[01:47:18.096 --> 01:47:20.977]  Now the NBA is on an anti-gun rant, and I want to say this.
[01:47:21.577 --> 01:47:27.440]  I'm on record as stating anybody who will take your guns away is your executioner.
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:29.221]  They can't give me any BS, they can't give me crap.
[01:47:29.221 --> 01:47:29.661]  That's right.
[01:47:29.661 --> 01:47:37.684]  Anybody promoting gun control, especially organized media, is a conscious enemy of you and your family who literally wants to break you and destroy you.
[01:47:37.684 --> 01:47:40.806]  Now remember that when you still watch the NBA or the NFL.
[01:47:40.806 --> 01:47:47.549]  Remember that when you're not actively out opening dialogues with people, exposing that these people are our enemies.
[01:47:48.527 --> 01:47:49.587]  Absolutely.
[01:47:49.587 --> 01:47:56.250]  And again, people forget who really went to work on propaganda.
[01:47:56.250 --> 01:47:58.151]  Let's look at it realistically.
[01:47:58.151 --> 01:48:03.973]  By the way, I put up a story yesterday on my website, Angela Merkel, that she was the head of the Stasi.
[01:48:03.973 --> 01:48:10.256]  She denied it, but CNN backed it up with all their Stasi, meaning East German secret police.
[01:48:10.256 --> 01:48:14.458]  Ask yourself, why would she, as the, if you will,
[01:48:15.739 --> 01:48:19.803]  The head of Germany allow the total destruction of Germany.
[01:48:19.803 --> 01:48:26.049]  Well, it's because the Illuminati has a one... Here's the thing, Alex, they don't get, the people don't get.
[01:48:26.049 --> 01:48:27.930]  It's order ab chaos.
[01:48:27.930 --> 01:48:32.415]  You're seeing the global chaos now to bring about the New World Order.
[01:48:32.415 --> 01:48:33.996]  Well, absolutely.
[01:48:33.996 --> 01:48:35.598]  I mean, look, they can make cats.
[01:48:36.274 --> 01:48:37.295]  That are part spider.
[01:48:37.295 --> 01:48:39.336]  They can make goats that are part spider.
[01:48:39.336 --> 01:48:42.658]  For 20 years that you could buy in Hong Kong glow-in-the-dark monkeys.
[01:48:42.658 --> 01:48:46.080]  I mean, I'm showing people mainstream news articles right now.
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:47.421]  This is not a joke.
[01:48:47.421 --> 01:48:51.604]  And I always see comments on InfoWars going, he was talking about glowing cats again today.
[01:48:51.604 --> 01:48:53.505]  They won't even go research it.
[01:48:53.505 --> 01:48:56.007]  It's mainstream news.
[01:48:56.007 --> 01:48:57.208]  This is what's going on.
[01:48:58.226 --> 01:48:59.207]  Absolutely.
[01:48:59.207 --> 01:49:14.300]  And here's the thing, you know, when there's a department of propaganda in the military, most of those people that'll take you on, or me on, and all the different, I hate Alex, I hate Steve, I hate this, I hate that forms, people who are on those forms have got to ask themselves,
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:16.841]  What have these people done to inform?
[01:49:16.841 --> 01:49:20.523]  Look, your record stands for what it is, my record stands for what it is.
[01:49:20.523 --> 01:49:26.726]  They can complain, they can moan, they can destroy our reputation, try.
[01:49:26.726 --> 01:49:32.269]  They can do all these things, but they can't account for being wrong for the last 20 years, can they?
[01:49:32.269 --> 01:49:35.330]  No, they want to change the subject onto us.
[01:49:35.330 --> 01:49:37.431]  I mean, look at this, you speak of the Islamic invasion.
[01:49:37.431 --> 01:49:38.412]  I would hear you on this.
[01:49:38.812 --> 01:49:43.333]  And a lot of others a decade ago and go, they're not really going to use the Muslims, the radical Muslims, to take over.
[01:49:43.333 --> 01:49:45.234]  I knew they were going to have a clash of civilizations.
[01:49:45.234 --> 01:49:46.314]  They admitted that.
[01:49:46.314 --> 01:49:47.915]  But, I mean, here it is.
[01:49:47.915 --> 01:49:48.895]  Organized Europe.
[01:49:48.895 --> 01:49:49.876]  Advertisers come in.
[01:49:49.876 --> 01:49:53.297]  They actually bring in the Sunni refugees that are the jihadist.
[01:49:53.297 --> 01:49:55.137]  They know they're going to attack.
[01:49:55.137 --> 01:49:56.538]  Common sense is suspended.
[01:49:57.478 --> 01:50:02.741]  Steve, and when they do attack us, they announce that citizens are going to lose their rights.
[01:50:02.741 --> 01:50:06.783]  It turns out the FBI was blocked from going after the San Bernardino people.
[01:50:06.783 --> 01:50:09.845]  I mean, they really are going to bring in these proxy armies.
[01:50:09.845 --> 01:50:12.246]  How bad is the Islamic invasion going to get of Europe?
[01:50:12.246 --> 01:50:13.187]  I mean, what's the endgame there?
[01:50:13.982 --> 01:50:22.970]  Well, the endgame is the complete dissolution of Europe for, I don't know, a brief time period, and then you're going to see total war against the Muslims.
[01:50:22.970 --> 01:50:25.632]  You probably saw Poland said, we'll raise an army of 150,000.
[01:50:25.632 --> 01:50:28.054]  I clap and salute.
[01:50:28.054 --> 01:50:29.776]  The President of Hungary said not here.
[01:50:29.776 --> 01:50:32.738]  The President of the Czech Republic said not here.
[01:50:32.738 --> 01:50:36.882]  And it's fascinating, isn't it, Alex, that the idea of those very same
[01:50:37.462 --> 01:50:42.424]  People that withstood the Muslim invasion of Europe are withstanding them now.
[01:50:42.424 --> 01:50:52.788]  Meanwhile, we just got the news today, you probably saw it, that in those 70-year-old declassified records, it shows that the French government, the Vichy government, was working with the Nazis to exterminate the Jews.
[01:50:52.788 --> 01:50:54.348]  I don't know if you saw that story yet.
[01:50:54.348 --> 01:50:55.109]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:50:55.109 --> 01:50:56.389]  That's how they took over France.
[01:50:56.389 --> 01:50:57.689]  France didn't even fight.
[01:50:57.689 --> 01:50:58.650]  The Germans infiltrated them.

[01:53:28.177 --> 01:53:31.238]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:53:31.238 --> 01:53:33.858]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:53:33.858 --> 01:53:34.599]  Croix River.
[01:53:34.599 --> 01:53:36.839]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:53:36.839 --> 01:53:39.800]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:40.680]  His excuse?
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:42.000]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.621]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:53:43.621 --> 01:53:49.382]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[01:54:03.948 --> 01:54:04.488]  to 3 p.m.
[01:54:04.488 --> 01:54:06.509]  Central, we're here live.
[01:54:06.509 --> 01:54:12.571]  Steve Quayle's our guest, about 20-30 minutes to the next hour, and we'll go to Simon, Frank, Ray, Mike, Chris, and others.
[01:54:12.571 --> 01:54:21.473]  By the way, last week I started telling a story on air, a true story that I've never really gotten into, and then a video was put out about it, and it went viral.
[01:54:21.473 --> 01:54:23.953]  I'll put that on TV screen for TV viewers.
[01:54:23.953 --> 01:54:26.094]  For radio listeners, I will give you the headline.
[01:54:27.617 --> 01:54:31.460]  Assassin brought in to kill Alex Jones dies in police shootout.
[01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:35.904]  That was the headline, whoever gave the headlines that day came up with.
[01:54:35.904 --> 01:54:45.751]  The reason I think of this is Steve Quayle talked about a case where some special forces people found out about a plan to kill him about a decade ago and it got stopped at a public event.
[01:54:45.751 --> 01:54:50.375]  That's why Quayle hasn't really been in public or been seen since then.
[01:54:50.375 --> 01:54:51.276]  Here's what I want to tell you.
[01:54:52.552 --> 01:54:57.393]  Since I mentioned this, I am going to get all the documents together and do a short piece on it.
[01:54:57.393 --> 01:55:02.034]  But it's not the kind of thing that you want to give attention to.
[01:55:02.034 --> 01:55:06.955]  I mean, it's really weird when you're actually talking about yourself.
[01:55:06.955 --> 01:55:10.396]  But I love the trolls on there, you know, saying, oh, that's not true.
[01:55:10.396 --> 01:55:12.656]  You know, none of this happened.
[01:55:12.656 --> 01:55:17.097]  It's like the time the FBI came here about the Obama deception and was asking about the Obama deception.
[01:55:18.086 --> 01:55:20.588]  And then a year later at a trial, it actually came up.
[01:55:20.588 --> 01:55:23.050]  It was sealed via a subpoena.
[01:55:23.050 --> 01:55:25.952]  I couldn't tell you why they were here.
[01:55:25.952 --> 01:55:27.513]  And then, oh, it was true, wasn't it?
[01:55:27.513 --> 01:55:34.157]  Well, a couple years ago, the Austin police chief was here to discuss a bunch of issues on air.
[01:55:34.157 --> 01:55:38.821]  And he said, hey, you know, you know, we basically stopped some guy coming to kill you two weeks ago.
[01:55:41.107 --> 01:55:43.568]  He goes, I was too busy to come on, but once this happened, you were asking me on.
[01:55:43.568 --> 01:55:44.709]  I came on to tell you.
[01:55:44.709 --> 01:55:45.889]  He goes, you really don't know about this.
[01:55:45.889 --> 01:55:49.130]  He goes, well, I can't talk about it, but you'll know soon.
[01:55:49.130 --> 01:55:54.132]  And the guy that came here reportedly to do this last name was Chaney.
[01:55:54.132 --> 01:55:55.273]  And they've got the files there.
[01:55:55.273 --> 01:55:57.514]  I was just looking at him during the break.
[01:55:57.514 --> 01:55:58.654]  And then he came here.
[01:55:58.654 --> 01:55:59.595]  They caught him.
[01:55:59.595 --> 01:56:01.495]  They couldn't keep him in jail.
[01:56:01.495 --> 01:56:02.356]  They ran him out of town.
[01:56:04.013 --> 01:56:09.601]  And then the police in California went after him and he died in a firefight with them and a house got burned down.
[01:56:09.601 --> 01:56:12.445]  I mean, this was in the news in California.
[01:56:12.445 --> 01:56:13.927]  I was sent this by detectives there.
[01:56:14.781 --> 01:56:21.483]  And so, okay, I'll do a piece on it, but notice the trolls will say that's a lie, because that's what their job is.
[01:56:21.483 --> 01:56:23.463]  And people are like, why haven't we heard about this before?
[01:56:23.463 --> 01:56:37.047]  Well, because if you haven't experienced this, like my cousin just retired out of the army, but they were getting stuff from like cartels in their mailboxes saying where they lived and what their family was doing.
[01:56:37.047 --> 01:56:41.328]  Until you've experienced this stuff, you sit there in your basements as your little men,
[01:56:42.128 --> 01:56:46.512]  And then you point at people in the arena and you tell us what's true and what isn't.
[01:56:46.512 --> 01:56:47.913]  Oh, that couldn't be happening.
[01:56:47.913 --> 01:56:55.200]  Because until you've experienced all this, you just don't know how real it is.
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:56.702]  And I'll go back.
[01:56:56.702 --> 01:57:02.827]  I wasn't telling the story in a kind of half-baked way because I just barely went over it.
[01:57:02.827 --> 01:57:07.432]  Because I was talking about the fact that the police were looking out
[01:57:08.542 --> 01:57:09.743]  For me.
[01:57:09.743 --> 01:57:14.487]  And they weren't using illegal data, they were using social network scrubbing systems to see what people were saying.
[01:57:14.487 --> 01:57:21.793]  So it's a weird paradox where the kind of spy system probably saved my life and got a cop killed.
[01:57:21.793 --> 01:57:24.815]  And then I was just saying it's weird like, oh, the police won.
[01:57:24.815 --> 01:57:27.617]  It's an interesting paradox.
[01:57:27.617 --> 01:57:30.960]  And so Quayle talked about that and it made me think of, we're going to break in a minute and a half.
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:32.561]  Steve, I'm sorry I'm ranting so much today.
[01:57:32.561 --> 01:57:36.565]  It's just that people don't know how real this stuff is.
[01:57:36.565 --> 01:57:36.825]  Go ahead.
[01:57:38.283 --> 01:57:44.729]  Well, Alex, again, I thank God for everyone that prays for your safety, prays for my safety, my family's safety.
[01:57:44.729 --> 01:57:47.391]  But, you know, ladies and gentlemen, there's a whole group.
[01:57:47.391 --> 01:57:55.999]  I had a lieutenant colonel in my office from NORAD, you know, and he was basically telling me with tears in his eyes.
[01:57:55.999 --> 01:57:56.880]  I knew him.
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:01.144]  His father was a former business associate of mine 20 years ago.
[01:58:01.144 --> 01:58:02.465]  We did film stuff together.
[01:58:02.925 --> 01:58:09.687]  And with tears in his eyes, he said, Steve, we're going to do everything we can to destroy you guys on talk radio.
[01:58:09.687 --> 01:58:10.687]  We'll destroy you.
[01:58:10.687 --> 01:58:12.288]  We'll put innuendos out there.
[01:58:12.288 --> 01:58:13.408]  He said, I can't take it.
[01:58:13.408 --> 01:58:14.809]  He said, I'm a Christian.
[01:58:14.809 --> 01:58:18.330]  So Alex, I thank God for the intercept of that.
[01:58:18.330 --> 01:58:21.411]  And look, there are people that tell you stuff.
[01:58:21.411 --> 01:58:26.252]  I'll say things like, well, a certain general in the special forces told me, I don't believe it.
[01:58:26.252 --> 01:58:27.293]  Quayle won't tell his name.
[01:58:27.293 --> 01:58:27.453]  What?
[01:58:27.453 --> 01:58:29.373]  He makes his crap up, you know?
[01:58:29.373 --> 01:58:31.514]  And sure enough, stuff will happen, just like I've been told.
[01:58:31.994 --> 01:58:32.794]  Can I tell you something?
[01:58:32.794 --> 01:58:33.495]  We're there, Alex.
[01:58:33.495 --> 01:58:35.435]  I mean, make the bottom line.
[01:58:35.435 --> 01:58:35.876]  Stay there.
[01:58:35.876 --> 01:58:36.876]  Come back to the bottom line.
[01:58:36.876 --> 01:58:37.236]  70 seconds.
[01:58:37.236 --> 01:58:38.917]  We'll run right to you, Steve.
[01:58:38.917 --> 01:58:40.558]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:58:40.558 --> 01:58:41.178]  Third hour.
[01:58:41.178 --> 01:58:42.418]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:42.418 --> 01:58:44.299]  And there's a fourth hour.

[01:58:47.681 --> 01:58:55.884]  I'm dreaming of a white Christmas.
[01:58:57.344 --> 01:58:59.706]  The best-selling single of all time.
[01:58:59.706 --> 01:59:03.189]  In excess of a hundred million copies sold worldwide.
[01:59:03.189 --> 01:59:11.015]  But our college kids, raised on a narrative of white privilege and microaggression, think it's an offense to people of color.
[01:59:11.015 --> 01:59:12.377]  It's insulting to people of color.
[01:59:12.377 --> 01:59:17.080]  It perpetuates the idea that white is naturally good and that other colors are bad.
[01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:19.843]  And we feel that that's a microaggression.
[01:59:19.843 --> 01:59:21.904]  Here's a clue, boys and girls.
[01:59:21.904 --> 01:59:23.586]  It's about snow.
[01:59:25.467 --> 01:59:37.998]  The government educational establishment is destroying any connection to existing culture so that they can create a new political culture, one of censorship and intolerance done in the name of tolerance.
[01:59:37.998 --> 01:59:39.159]  Fight back.
[01:59:39.159 --> 01:59:40.680]  Give the gift of knowledge.
[01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:44.943]  Send your friends to InfoWars, the cure for political correctness.
[01:59:44.943 --> 01:59:46.805]  And tell them Merry Christmas.
[01:59:51.134 --> 01:59:53.722]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:10.353 --> 02:00:12.234]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:00:12.234 --> 02:00:19.620]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:19.620 --> 02:00:28.787]  Steve Quayle, your calls are coming up here in just a moment, but Steve Quayle was about to get to what he said was the bottom line, Steve Quayle.
[02:00:33.843 --> 02:00:35.064]  Yes, go ahead, Steve.
[02:00:35.064 --> 02:00:37.585]  Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know if the music was still playing.
[02:00:37.585 --> 02:00:43.248]  Bottom line is, everything that you and I have warned about and others have warned about is in play now.
[02:00:43.248 --> 02:00:45.690]  It's no longer a matter of conjecture.
[02:00:45.690 --> 02:00:50.433]  It's no matter of being able to say, well, you're going to see this stuff.
[02:00:50.433 --> 02:00:51.593]  It's all playing out.
[02:00:51.593 --> 02:00:53.895]  By the way, as we're on the radio today, and it's the 28th,
[02:00:55.115 --> 02:00:56.196]  We're good to go.
[02:01:17.106 --> 02:01:31.336]  He knows he's going to have a problem with the total Islamic invasion of even Russia, because Russia's bordered by what, eight breakaway republics, or what were breakaway republics that are still very strongly Muslim-oriented.
[02:01:31.336 --> 02:01:36.179]  So the fact that that's happening while you and I are on the air, what more has to happen, Alex?
[02:01:36.179 --> 02:01:37.960]  Seriously, what more has to happen?
[02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:41.623]  And by the way, I went on record 20 years ago as human beings are completely
[02:01:42.083 --> 02:01:42.504]  We're good to go.
[02:02:04.406 --> 02:02:18.921]  But the ones who they would dupe that would basically have our mannerisms, our characterisms, and our downloads of what makes us us, the bottom line is outside of the spirit that God gave us, those, they would be almost unknowable.
[02:02:19.681 --> 02:02:31.972]  Let me say this, if you listen to all the elites in their own admissions, from Ray Kurzweil to you name it, they say we're going to have new clone bodies and we're going to be supermen and nobody else is going to get to have this.
[02:02:31.972 --> 02:02:37.957]  There's a genetic arms race to obtain this and so much of it's secret, who knows what they've really got.
[02:02:37.957 --> 02:02:45.103]  I mean, 20 years ago, the communist Chinese were cloning cows that were part human to create human milk.
[02:02:45.863 --> 02:02:49.584]  I mean, it's been on the market for a decade in China, at least.
[02:02:49.584 --> 02:02:52.585]  I tell the average person in the street that, they laugh at me.
[02:02:52.585 --> 02:02:55.626]  Oh, there's a cow that's part human!
[02:02:55.626 --> 02:02:58.406]  They won't even Google it, Steve.
[02:02:58.406 --> 02:02:59.166]  I know.
[02:02:59.166 --> 02:03:00.007]  Well, here's the thing.
[02:03:00.007 --> 02:03:12.170]  I'm praying as your audience increases and my audience increases, while we still have breath and the protection of Almighty God, which I thank the Lord for, and I do thank the Lord that the attempt on your life was unsuccessful.
[02:03:12.170 --> 02:03:13.050]  But Alex, listen.
[02:03:13.710 --> 02:03:23.273]  Every day, as things speed up, and it comes at us from all directions, people have got to understand something.
[02:03:23.273 --> 02:03:25.994]  That when they go for the guns, they're going for the guns.
[02:03:25.994 --> 02:03:27.554]  It will be a blitzkrieg.
[02:03:27.554 --> 02:03:28.875]  There you go for a German word.
[02:03:29.915 --> 02:03:31.956]  Well, I can't believe that.
[02:03:31.956 --> 02:03:35.277]  They've got 200, 300 million guns in America.
[02:03:35.277 --> 02:03:38.158]  Yeah, but you're not... How do I say this?
[02:03:38.158 --> 02:03:45.761]  Most people that are hunters don't know how to take on a Delta team, if you will, or Spetsnaz, or the Chinese...
[02:03:46.161 --> 02:03:47.541]  Well, it's going to be beyond that.
[02:03:47.541 --> 02:03:56.304]  They're going to have a patriot shoot up a school or something, and it's going to be so embarrassing that you're going to be blamed with that if you don't submit and turn in the semi-auto.
[02:03:56.304 --> 02:03:57.704]  They admit their plan.
[02:03:57.704 --> 02:04:02.766]  Once people agree to one group being banned, then they will start banning monthly everything after that.
[02:04:03.499 --> 02:04:05.301]  Right, and people have got to get it together.
[02:04:05.301 --> 02:04:07.322]  This isn't about taking away your guns.
[02:04:07.322 --> 02:04:09.244]  They plan to blow the gun owners away.
[02:04:09.244 --> 02:04:14.408]  A specific Canadian general was heard on a recorded message.
[02:04:14.408 --> 02:04:16.850]  I think Hawk was the one that broadcast it.
[02:04:16.850 --> 02:04:17.911]  And, well, I know he was.
[02:04:17.911 --> 02:04:20.574]  The deal is, basically, here's what the general said.
[02:04:20.574 --> 02:04:23.016]  Paraphrase, but it wasn't a tough statement to remember.
[02:04:23.576 --> 02:04:30.440]  The Americans don't understand when they go into the camps, they don't come out, and all of their stuff becomes a spoils of war.
[02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:35.463]  You know the old statement, you never find a U-Haul trailer behind a hearse?
[02:04:35.463 --> 02:04:38.145]  But I think you do intellectually in America.
[02:04:38.145 --> 02:04:43.248]  Somehow people think, well if I just give them my semi-automatic then I can go back and watch as the world...
[02:04:43.288 --> 02:04:45.811]  They want the gun because they want your kids.
[02:04:45.811 --> 02:04:46.832]  They want you.
[02:04:46.832 --> 02:04:47.853]  They want it all.
[02:04:47.853 --> 02:04:55.560]  They want to sit there with the little socialists and all these professors and people literally running camps, kicking our guts in while we're chained down.
[02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:57.843]  It's about a power trip for these bags of us.

[02:06:58.891 --> 02:07:05.798]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered 6 months free at Christmas.
[02:07:05.798 --> 02:07:08.682]  We've always offered 5 months free.
[02:07:08.682 --> 02:07:14.588]  But since I announced 6 free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[02:07:14.588 --> 02:07:18.032]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[02:07:18.032 --> 02:07:20.995]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[02:07:21.295 --> 02:07:30.263]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books, and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:08:10.865 --> 02:08:14.948]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:08:14.948 --> 02:08:16.529]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:16.529 --> 02:08:20.091]  Steve Quayle of SteveQuayle.com is our guest.
[02:08:20.091 --> 02:08:26.215]  His latest book is a best-seller, Empire Beneath the Ice, dealing with all the Nazification of America.
[02:08:26.215 --> 02:08:29.457]  I want to be clear, it doesn't mean go after the, quote, minorities.
[02:08:29.457 --> 02:08:32.459]  It means a system of social control.
[02:08:32.459 --> 02:08:35.901]  Eugenicists are on record saying, we're not going to go against certain races or people.
[02:08:35.901 --> 02:08:38.423]  We're going to go against basically everybody.
[02:08:40.282 --> 02:08:42.403]  And it's a science of social control.
[02:08:42.403 --> 02:08:46.444]  I want to go to Simon, Frank, Ray, Mike, Chris, and others.
[02:08:46.444 --> 02:08:52.205]  We're going to have our guests at the bottom of the hour that'll get into a bunch of special reports and other key intel we have not yet covered.
[02:08:52.205 --> 02:08:57.186]  But Steve, I've got to ask you this question briefly and then go to these calls.
[02:08:57.186 --> 02:09:06.169]  Matt Drudge was here a few months ago, but I've talked to a lot of other people in media, syndicated talk radio, big local talk radio, you name it.
[02:09:07.933 --> 02:09:23.041]  For people that don't know, most of even your smaller radio change and TV change are financed or controlled one way or another by JP Morgan, by Wells Fargo, Berkshire Hathaway.
[02:09:23.041 --> 02:09:24.922]  The big one of course is Goldman Sachs.
[02:09:26.294 --> 02:09:27.615]  They're involved in everything.
[02:09:27.615 --> 02:09:30.457]  And I was taken off XM last year.
[02:09:30.457 --> 02:09:32.159]  Very successful on there.
[02:09:32.159 --> 02:09:40.105]  After being on like seven years, I was taken off a lot of medium-sized company radio stations.
[02:09:40.105 --> 02:09:41.306]  And they'd say, nope, no problem.
[02:09:41.306 --> 02:09:41.926]  We have the ratings.
[02:09:41.926 --> 02:09:42.367]  No problem.
[02:09:42.367 --> 02:09:43.728]  People love you.
[02:09:43.728 --> 02:09:45.309]  In fact, we've had you on here for years.
[02:09:45.309 --> 02:09:47.451]  Will you please just not attack us when we take you off?
[02:09:47.451 --> 02:09:48.892]  We'll be honest with you.
[02:09:48.892 --> 02:09:50.153]  It is a corporate decision.
[02:09:52.097 --> 02:09:54.559]  And that's what's going on.
[02:09:54.559 --> 02:10:01.723]  And they're getting rid of locals who are on the radio, conservative morning hosting people.
[02:10:01.723 --> 02:10:02.904]  And I've talked to these folks.
[02:10:02.904 --> 02:10:05.886]  It's not to bring in newer, cheaper people.
[02:10:05.886 --> 02:10:07.467]  They are putting liberals on.
[02:10:07.467 --> 02:10:09.988]  They're putting on fake pseudo-conservatives.
[02:10:09.988 --> 02:10:11.589]  So here's how the teams work.
[02:10:11.589 --> 02:10:13.010]  We're going to your calls.
[02:10:13.010 --> 02:10:18.814]  You'll have one guy who's a pseudo-conservative but kind of loses the arguments.
[02:10:18.814 --> 02:10:20.115]  Then you'll have the, quote, liberal.
[02:10:21.553 --> 02:10:24.915]  And that's who they're putting on everywhere.
[02:10:24.915 --> 02:10:27.918]  And they even tell people, can you do this new format?
[02:10:27.918 --> 02:10:29.379]  This is what the consultants say.
[02:10:29.379 --> 02:10:34.662]  And what it means is you do what the consultant says, not because you're going to make money or because it's going to be successful.
[02:10:34.662 --> 02:10:41.327]  You do what the corporate consultant says, because then the ad agency will give you money.
[02:10:41.327 --> 02:10:42.228]  So Steve Quayle,
[02:10:43.562 --> 02:10:46.846]  There is a purge of libertarian patriot media.
[02:10:46.846 --> 02:10:49.610]  They're coming out to the internet as well because we're exploding.
[02:10:49.610 --> 02:10:51.152]  Because we are hurting them.
[02:10:51.152 --> 02:10:57.560]  They can't have this criminal takeover and have the TPP rule America outside of law and do forced inoculations if we're on the air.
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:10:58.642]  But don't they get it?
[02:10:59.246 --> 02:11:03.470]  That the transmission already went out to the police and military and others?
[02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:05.472]  And that people now know?
[02:11:05.472 --> 02:11:09.416]  Don't they get that we didn't just sit here flat-footed the last twenty-something years?
[02:11:09.416 --> 02:11:10.977]  Yourself and countless others?
[02:11:10.977 --> 02:11:13.079]  And that we now are in a fighting position?
[02:11:13.079 --> 02:11:14.461]  Don't they understand that, Steve Coyle?
[02:11:15.471 --> 02:11:25.561]  I think they're blinded by their rage and the lies they believe, the Luciferian lies, Valhalla, if you will, without any reference to God.
[02:11:25.561 --> 02:11:29.324]  It's a spiritual battle, Alex, but it takes place in the physical realm.
[02:11:29.324 --> 02:11:34.029]  I think the problem is that the professing Christian church has become
[02:11:34.489 --> 02:11:45.797]  The weakest expression of that which the men of faith, the men you and I quote, the men you and I read in the Bible laid down their lives for, and Dietrich Bonhoeffer withstood the Nazis.
[02:11:45.797 --> 02:11:47.218]  I mean, let's face it.
[02:11:47.218 --> 02:11:49.339]  There are very few Bonhoeffers in this world.
[02:11:49.339 --> 02:11:58.185]  There's a whole lot of just embrace the enemies we're in, people, because everybody, Jesus said, friendship with the world is enmity with God, okay?
[02:11:58.185 --> 02:12:01.287]  But people will choose political correctness
[02:12:01.907 --> 02:12:07.930]  As long as nobody messes with their big screen TV or whatever it is.
[02:12:07.930 --> 02:12:10.471]  So basically, I call it narcosynthesis.
[02:12:10.471 --> 02:12:14.633]  Narcosynthesis has another meaning, but here's how I define narcosynthesis.
[02:12:14.633 --> 02:12:19.655]  When, you know, what's his name, was it Lennon who said religion is the opiate of the masses?
[02:12:19.655 --> 02:12:21.956]  Television is the opiate of the masses.
[02:12:21.956 --> 02:12:23.436]  Marshall McLuhan was right.
[02:12:23.436 --> 02:12:28.559]  It's not the messages that we see on TV, it's the TV that is the message itself.
[02:12:28.559 --> 02:12:29.599]  That's why they call it television.
[02:12:30.980 --> 02:12:33.442]  The medium is the message.
[02:12:33.442 --> 02:12:35.704]  Yes, sir, that's what I'm trying to say.
[02:12:35.704 --> 02:12:36.384]  Well, that's it.
[02:12:36.384 --> 02:12:37.345]  I've got articles here.
[02:12:37.345 --> 02:12:45.011]  Man walks off cliff and plummets 60 feet to his death on Christmas Day while distracted by his cell phone.
[02:12:45.011 --> 02:12:51.116]  Literally, third world diseases are becoming antibiotic immune, not resistant.
[02:12:51.116 --> 02:12:53.058]  All these diseases are exploding.
[02:12:53.058 --> 02:12:55.399]  Mass death statistically is increasing.
[02:12:55.399 --> 02:12:56.720]  All sorts of real problems.
[02:12:57.561 --> 02:13:02.505]  And our elites don't even care because they've got advanced medicines and technologies that basically protect them.
[02:13:02.505 --> 02:13:03.746]  It's well known.
[02:13:03.746 --> 02:13:11.093]  And it's just crazy that the average person, Steve Quayle, would want to go along with this thinking they'll be safe.
[02:13:11.093 --> 02:13:15.256]  I've talked to a lot of really famous people, as I know you do, off record.
[02:13:15.256 --> 02:13:20.601]  And some of them, you know, just, you know, people think of them as, you know, Mr. Tough Guy.
[02:13:21.448 --> 02:13:26.532]  But they can't believe that I'm willing to go on air and do this stuff.
[02:13:26.532 --> 02:13:31.255]  I talked to so many military people, famous special forces people, you name it.
[02:13:31.255 --> 02:13:34.017]  They're scared of this system.
[02:13:34.017 --> 02:13:38.541]  But I don't get how I'd be scared not to fight it and let it win.
[02:13:38.541 --> 02:13:41.603]  I'm not fighting this because I'm full of courage, I'm fighting it because
[02:13:42.103 --> 02:13:45.846]  I realize I'm like, you know, a dog in a cage being lowered into water.
[02:13:45.846 --> 02:13:47.687]  I need to get out of here or I'm going to drown.
[02:13:47.687 --> 02:13:49.789]  I mean, don't they have survival instincts?
[02:13:49.789 --> 02:13:52.811]  When you see something like this coming, you can't run from this.
[02:13:52.811 --> 02:13:54.172]  All you can do is fight it.
[02:13:54.172 --> 02:13:55.513]  Where is the fighting spirit?
[02:13:55.513 --> 02:14:01.017]  I mean, I know people are waking up, but where's the fighting spirit, Steve Quayle, to really get aggressive with this?
[02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:07.537]  Well, it's mind control, Alex, and it's the numbing and dumbing down, okay?
[02:14:07.537 --> 02:14:14.204]  Nobody's at a fighting prime when, number one, they refuse to even acknowledge that there's a war on.
[02:14:14.204 --> 02:14:19.710]  Also, the thing is that people have no fear of God anymore, but they have fear of man.
[02:14:19.710 --> 02:14:21.853]  And I said this on the radio, and I stand by it.
[02:14:22.133 --> 02:14:27.458]  Do you realize everybody who was outed out of the military, their top positions, generals, admirals, etc.
[02:14:27.458 --> 02:14:34.845]  took an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign, domestic, yet they basically left with their pensions and they went quiet.
[02:14:34.845 --> 02:14:37.367]  There's maybe a few exceptions, you know some of them.
[02:14:37.367 --> 02:14:41.351]  Now I know in the background, when all hell breaks loose, so do they, okay?
[02:14:41.351 --> 02:14:42.712]  So it's not hopeless.
[02:14:42.712 --> 02:14:46.956]  But I can tell you this, the country is totally given over to witchcraft,
[02:14:47.456 --> 02:14:51.257]  Satanism, Luciferianism, and globalism.
[02:14:51.257 --> 02:15:02.521]  And again, what you're seeing is, you have talked, I've talked, ladies and gentlemen, you're talking a quarter of a billion people all in all that have been murdered when global disarmament went into play.
[02:15:02.521 --> 02:15:04.762]  Well listen, listen, my left is getting really aggressive.
[02:15:05.342 --> 02:15:08.323]  Now, two, they're doing all sorts of dirty tricks behind the scenes.
[02:15:08.323 --> 02:15:18.326]  Even their low-level minions are, like, demonically activating, like, zombies getting a radio frequency, and I use that as an allegory, and, like, false police reports.
[02:15:18.326 --> 02:15:19.206]  You name it.
[02:15:19.206 --> 02:15:23.387]  Starting fights with me in, you know, lines at checkout counters because of who I am.
[02:15:23.387 --> 02:15:24.868]  They're like, it's their time.
[02:15:24.868 --> 02:15:27.609]  They're, like, charging up.
[02:15:27.609 --> 02:15:28.969]  They feel their hour is here.
[02:15:29.764 --> 02:15:36.008]  Well, you're correct, and the Bible talks specifically about that, where war is going to be made on the saints, you know?
[02:15:36.008 --> 02:15:37.349]  And the thing is, they know.
[02:15:37.349 --> 02:15:38.170]  Can I say something?
[02:15:38.170 --> 02:15:45.295]  They know now they've got legal cover, they know they've got evil spiritual cover, and the problem is the Christians don't get it.
[02:15:45.295 --> 02:15:46.035]  They're serious.
[02:15:46.035 --> 02:15:50.198]  And by the way, Alex, just as a word of encouragement,
[02:15:50.558 --> 02:15:59.065]  You know, the people that you know that are capable of providing you, you know, 24-hour security, I would recommend you update it.
[02:15:59.065 --> 02:16:00.065]  I really would.
[02:16:00.065 --> 02:16:08.372]  The point being is I've learned something living in the world of death threats and operations, you know, against me is that you cannot take it for granted.
[02:16:08.652 --> 02:16:09.392]  I don't know.
[02:16:23.660 --> 02:16:25.101]  By the way, I want to keep you for the full hour.
[02:16:25.101 --> 02:16:29.824]  I want to get into World War 3 after the callers if you can stay for the rest of the hour.
[02:16:29.824 --> 02:16:30.624]  I want to get into
[02:16:49.828 --> 02:16:55.609]  The former head of DIA going public, as you know, two months ago and saying our government created ISIS, runs it, premeditated.
[02:16:55.609 --> 02:16:59.410]  That's a big act of courage in this land of cowards.
[02:16:59.410 --> 02:17:09.192]  Where that's going, and the fact that how this could trigger World War III, or the next big war, with what Russia's doing, and you're right, Putin has given launch power to the generals in the field.
[02:17:09.192 --> 02:17:13.493]  Unprecedented danger, and the average yuppie is just making jokes.
[02:17:13.973 --> 02:17:15.373]  The Daily Beast is making jokes.
[02:17:15.373 --> 02:17:16.854]  They really all think it's funny.
[02:17:16.854 --> 02:17:18.614]  We're going to skip this network break.
[02:17:18.614 --> 02:17:20.495]  I want to go to these callers now.
[02:17:20.495 --> 02:17:21.715]  Simon in Florida.
[02:17:21.715 --> 02:17:24.516]  You're on the air worldwide with Steve Quayle.
[02:17:24.516 --> 02:17:24.896]  Go ahead.
[02:17:24.896 --> 02:17:26.696]  Hey, gentlemen.
[02:17:26.696 --> 02:17:27.557]  How are we doing today?
[02:17:27.557 --> 02:17:28.237]  We're all right, brother.
[02:17:28.237 --> 02:17:29.697]  Go ahead.
[02:17:29.697 --> 02:17:30.037]  Great.
[02:17:30.037 --> 02:17:31.338]  Good questions for Steve.
[02:17:31.338 --> 02:17:36.259]  Steve, we know things will be like they were in the days of Noah before the return of Christ.
[02:17:36.969 --> 02:17:48.553]  And I wanted to know what you thought about climate change and geoengineering and what they might have to do with possible giants and changing the atmospheric pressure and oxygen levels to create that.
[02:17:48.553 --> 02:17:56.116]  Specifically, I want to get, you know, where we can prove here is that they've come out with the Smithsonian and others and admitted that the jet condensation, not crystals,
[02:17:56.616 --> 02:17:59.779]  But the jet fumes are creating terraforming.
[02:17:59.779 --> 02:18:04.143]  The Earth is 22 to 31 percent darker, depending on what area you look at.
[02:18:04.143 --> 02:18:16.015]  And it's a big secret program to add the different aluminum dioxide, barium, and other isotopes to the jet fuel through the classic jet engine to disperse and aerosolize.
[02:18:16.015 --> 02:18:17.116]  So I want to go back to that question.
[02:18:17.116 --> 02:18:17.917]  Thank you for the call, Simon.
[02:18:18.337 --> 02:18:22.500]  Why are they now kind of admitting some of this?
[02:18:22.500 --> 02:18:28.164]  And clearly, if they have weather weapons, then they could create earth calamities to push their carbon taxes.
[02:18:28.164 --> 02:18:30.385]  What's really behind this from your research?
[02:18:30.385 --> 02:18:34.648]  Well, first of all, Simon's on to something, and here's the deal, Alex.
[02:18:34.648 --> 02:18:39.992]  Geoengineering, and again, an Austin general told me this, it's TERROR-forming.
[02:18:39.992 --> 02:18:41.933]  T-E-R-R-O-R-forming.
[02:18:42.475 --> 02:18:46.718]  The idea is to do away with humanity as you know it now.
[02:18:46.718 --> 02:18:57.987]  The idea is to come up with a, if you will, hybridized vestige of former humanity and bring in an atmosphere that's similar, which will support the life.
[02:18:57.987 --> 02:19:03.971]  Look, you said something that's really, I think, even beyond the depth of what most people can understand.
[02:19:03.971 --> 02:19:06.553]  You said it's almost like all the demons have been turned loose.
[02:19:06.553 --> 02:19:08.234]  All hell has opened up.
[02:19:08.234 --> 02:19:09.015]  And I know this sounds
[02:19:09.355 --> 02:19:17.099]  Almost metaphoric, and the monsters out there, the two-legged monsters that are terrestrial origin will say, oh, I don't believe all that stuff he's talking about.
[02:19:17.099 --> 02:19:32.687]  What Simon the Caller was talking about is they are actually manipulating the atmosphere to make it inhospitable to mankind, but very hospitable to the genetic mutations, and what I call the monsters are making laboratories, you know?
[02:19:32.687 --> 02:19:36.309]  All I know is this stuff is all really going on, and if what we know
[02:19:37.253 --> 02:19:37.733]  Right.
[02:19:37.733 --> 02:19:44.157]  I mean, Hillary said taking over the internet is going to be the new Manhattan Project, and she admitted we have many other Manhattan Projects.
[02:19:44.157 --> 02:19:44.817]  They do.
[02:19:44.817 --> 02:19:48.119]  And they're just taking all our resources and building God knows what.
[02:19:48.119 --> 02:19:53.382]  They act like they don't care, and then every chance they get, they're massacring Christians all over the world.
[02:19:53.382 --> 02:19:55.443]  And it is spiritual.
[02:19:55.443 --> 02:19:56.724]  They want to play God.
[02:19:56.724 --> 02:19:57.905]  They want to do ugly things.
[02:19:57.905 --> 02:19:59.766]  Frank, in New York, you're on the air.
[02:19:59.766 --> 02:20:00.366]  Thanks for holding.
[02:20:00.366 --> 02:20:00.727]  Go ahead.
[02:20:00.727 --> 02:20:03.348]  Good afternoon, my friends.
[02:20:03.348 --> 02:20:04.088]  How are you?
[02:20:04.088 --> 02:20:04.529]  Good, brother.
[02:20:04.529 --> 02:20:04.789]  Go ahead.
[02:20:06.181 --> 02:20:09.322]  Okay, I have a question for you, Alex, and another question for Mr. Keller.
[02:20:09.322 --> 02:20:09.862]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:20:09.862 --> 02:20:11.843]  I have a question to talk to you, sir.
[02:20:11.843 --> 02:20:12.263]  How are you?
[02:20:12.263 --> 02:20:14.184]  Thank you.
[02:20:14.184 --> 02:20:18.425]  Okay, um, you guys were talking about, um, you know, mixing the seed.
[02:20:18.425 --> 02:20:29.869]  You know, in the Bible, it states, um, keep my decrees, do not make, do not make different kinds of animals, do not plant your field with two kinds of seed, do not wear clothing woven of two kinds of material.
[02:20:30.407 --> 02:20:33.549]  Um, these people, and you're absolutely right, these people are Luciferians.
[02:20:33.549 --> 02:20:40.814]  I mean, even, you know, when the God of Eden, you know, when he ate that apple, you know, the devil basically said, you will become God.
[02:20:40.814 --> 02:20:48.580]  So these people believe that they're gonna, their salvation is through Nazism, that they're gonna live forever, which is, which is totally a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a.
[02:20:49.280 --> 02:20:50.200]  They're playing God.
[02:20:50.200 --> 02:20:59.263]  They're on a total power trip, being promised by the God of this world, whether it's real or not for atheists, the archetype, the mass consciousness, whatever you want to call it, it's real.
[02:20:59.263 --> 02:21:02.164]  Like Kurzweil said, I don't believe in God yet, I'm going to become God.
[02:21:02.164 --> 02:21:10.807]  The globalists believe they're a God, and the God they act like, historically, is the exact duplicate of Lucifer the devil, Steve Quayle.
[02:21:11.803 --> 02:21:16.488]  Well God in the book of Genesis set up barriers and said what he created was good.
[02:21:16.488 --> 02:21:19.811]  So every barrier that God created is now coming down.
[02:21:19.811 --> 02:21:22.774]  That's what Jesus meant when he said the gates of hell would not prevail.
[02:21:22.774 --> 02:21:26.958]  And men's genetics were mixed and all this wild stuff that reads like a science fiction book.
[02:21:26.958 --> 02:21:27.219]  I know.
[02:21:27.719 --> 02:21:29.521]  I just, the public, I don't think can handle all this.
[02:21:29.521 --> 02:21:35.026]  The point is the elite believe it, and then God destroyed all the life to get rid of this abomination.
[02:21:35.026 --> 02:21:46.217]  Well, whether that happened or not, folks, and of course I'm a Christian, I know it did, it's all happening again, and the elite are following the Bible to a T, except they think Lucifer is the winner, Steve.
[02:21:46.397 --> 02:21:47.337]  Absolutely.
[02:21:47.337 --> 02:21:51.680]  Look, the Vatican, I'm doing, you know, just, you know, we're doing our True Legends series.
[02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:56.542]  My film team just got back from Europe, you know, Rome.
[02:21:56.542 --> 02:22:02.124]  And what I'm telling you this, Alex, is what Tom Horne and others, Chris Putnam, you had Leo Zagami on your show.
[02:22:02.124 --> 02:22:03.965]  Others are saying the same thing.
[02:22:03.965 --> 02:22:15.731]  Look, they're ready to announce, whether people believe it or not, they're ready to announce that God did not create us, that we are the alien offspring of extraterrestrials.
[02:22:15.811 --> 02:22:17.673]  That's what Prometheus is, their real religion.
[02:22:17.673 --> 02:22:19.614]  Even the New York Times admitted that.
[02:22:19.614 --> 02:22:21.516]  The transpermia stuff.
[02:22:21.516 --> 02:22:27.521]  And then expanding on that, they've got the Vatican, astronomy, and saying, oh yes, there are other flocks, oh yes, aliens.
[02:22:27.521 --> 02:22:36.188]  I mean, clearly, is it going to be a Project Bluebeam where they admit they have plans, just like in China, they're projecting these fake cities in the sky to freak everybody out?
[02:22:36.188 --> 02:22:36.989]  I mean, will it be real?
[02:22:37.677 --> 02:22:40.439]  Well, it'll be beyond real, okay?
[02:22:40.439 --> 02:22:44.803]  Bluebeam and the technology for Bluebeam, you know, I mean, that goes back a long time.
[02:22:44.803 --> 02:22:47.585]  That's 20 years old plus, you know, I remember talking about that.
[02:22:47.585 --> 02:22:50.687]  You start talking about that when you first started your radio career.
[02:22:50.687 --> 02:22:59.134]  But the point is that what I'm talking about is the real manifestation, and you're seeing that with, what is it, childhoods and, you know,
[02:22:59.934 --> 02:23:07.177]  Uh, the Arthur C. Clarke that's on the SyFy channel, where the aliens are cloaked, but they finally manifest themselves.
[02:23:07.177 --> 02:23:09.698]  And they can give you anything and everything you want.
[02:23:09.698 --> 02:23:14.240]  That's the inventor of the communications satellite, Arthur C. Clarke, MI6.
[02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:15.601]  They give you everything you want.
[02:23:15.601 --> 02:23:17.502]  There's a little payoff at the end, though.
[02:23:18.297 --> 02:23:19.698]  Right, and here's the thing.
[02:23:19.698 --> 02:23:24.763]  You cannot separate the evil that's happening now from its supernatural origin.
[02:23:24.763 --> 02:23:28.266]  One of the differences, I always try and deal with the root of the matter.
[02:23:28.266 --> 02:23:33.511]  And when I spend, you know, all the years I've spent on this stuff researching it, footnoting it, I can tell you this.
[02:23:33.511 --> 02:23:39.196]  I've learned that people can handle it if it's presented in a historically footnoted version.
[02:23:39.196 --> 02:23:39.857]  For instance,
[02:23:40.237 --> 02:23:44.021]  You know, Empire Beneath the Ice, how the Nazis won World War II.
[02:23:44.021 --> 02:23:49.125]  Most people have never stated publicly, that I know, that the Nazis won World War II.
[02:23:49.125 --> 02:23:50.807]  The evidence is there.
[02:23:50.807 --> 02:23:54.350]  And yet, when we talk about genetic experiments, we talk about weather control.
[02:23:54.350 --> 02:24:03.678]  You know, you and I did a show on your show together, I guess an interview, on xenogenesis and the idea of sex robots, okay?
[02:24:03.678 --> 02:24:05.340]  Look, these guys are perverts.
[02:24:05.740 --> 02:24:14.725]  You know, we're seeing every form of mythological, of legendary mixes going on in the headlines.
[02:24:14.725 --> 02:24:27.692]  They're getting us ready with Facebook having 50 different sexual orientations, so when they, with the chemicals in the food and water making us behave in artificial ways, we won't even know what to do because our minds have been so scrambled.
[02:24:28.493 --> 02:24:29.474]  Absolutely.
[02:24:29.474 --> 02:24:30.234]  And look at the men.
[02:24:30.234 --> 02:24:37.118]  You know, there's a scripture, a curse that comes upon a nation that forgets God that says the men in the midst of you become women.
[02:24:37.118 --> 02:24:53.307]  Who would have ever thought with the advent of the birth control pill and the estrogen going into the water systems of the world's, you know, those who are at least in the Western world, look at what's happening to pretty much the Western world and especially, and this isn't a racist statement,
[02:24:53.647 --> 02:25:01.633]  But eugenics was aimed at the black community, and thank God there's a lot of really smart blacks out there that are listening to you and listening to me on that.
[02:25:01.633 --> 02:25:15.202]  But the birth control, you know, you probably quoted it, the former head of Morocco made the statement that the ultimate weapon of the invasionary forces of Mohammed would be the wombs of their women.
[02:25:15.202 --> 02:25:19.225]  So now you've got, and by the way, I don't call them immigrants, I call them invasionists, okay?
[02:25:19.785 --> 02:25:28.477]  The idea of hundreds of thousands of people coming into this country that cannot be screened, are not being screened, and are being armed.
[02:25:28.477 --> 02:25:29.499]  Alex, all the weapons.
[02:25:30.012 --> 02:25:40.676]  All the ammunition that you and I carried the stories on, that's all in strategically placed warehouses for the armies of the Mahdi, which are already within our border.
[02:25:40.676 --> 02:25:48.418]  It's not when it happens, excuse me, it is when it happens, but the more important question is, watch it happening before your eyes.
[02:25:48.418 --> 02:25:50.639]  It should be the ultimate wake-up call.
[02:25:53.314 --> 02:25:55.555]  I want to go back to calls.
[02:25:55.555 --> 02:25:58.997]  All I know is the elite believe in all this bizarre occult stuff.
[02:25:58.997 --> 02:26:03.519]  They believe they're communicating with entities that are giving them advanced knowledge.
[02:26:03.519 --> 02:26:06.561]  You look at all the stuff that's going on around us, all the technology.
[02:26:06.561 --> 02:26:10.863]  You look at how everything's hidden and it's basically a fraud right behind the scenes.
[02:26:10.863 --> 02:26:16.946]  And I can't even get the general public to admit that there are emergency centers that have already been built at military bases
[02:26:17.626 --> 02:26:26.629]  Which the army.mil, we'll put the internment camp document up, says we're going to quote re-educate Americans and how they're going to process their social security numbers.
[02:26:26.629 --> 02:26:29.230]  I mean, I wish none of this was true.
[02:26:29.230 --> 02:26:41.995]  And then anybody in the know, it's a weird paradox, Steve, and I'm going to go back to calls, but it's woken up the military, especially mid-level and high-level, because they now have to know it's real because they might go operational.
[02:26:41.995 --> 02:26:43.476]  They know the cover story's bull.
[02:26:44.923 --> 02:26:47.984]  But then the general public doesn't know about it.
[02:26:47.984 --> 02:26:52.786]  So it has had the effect of waking up a lot of people in the government, which is paradoxical.
[02:26:52.786 --> 02:27:00.069]  You think of the government as the enemy under a corrupt system, but actually it's one of the more awake groups because they are not as compartmentalized.
[02:27:00.069 --> 02:27:01.750]  And so I just don't see where this goes.
[02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:09.453]  I don't see the globalists are in as good a position as they would like us to believe, except then
[02:27:10.353 --> 02:27:16.623]  It doesn't matter how out in the open it is to us, because for people in a trance, it just, it doesn't even matter.
[02:27:16.623 --> 02:27:19.608]  So it's just, wow, I mean, what an exciting time to be alive, Steve.
[02:27:20.596 --> 02:27:33.861]  Well it is Alex and again the thing is is that the best we can do is by the grace of God and and the love that God has for his creation that he doesn't want to see destroyed you know the Bible says God's people perish for lack of knowledge.
[02:27:33.861 --> 02:27:49.487]  We give them the knowledge but they have to they have their hearts have to become alive okay to the truth you know the truth is so foreign now look we have the greatest manifestation of lies coming from the US government that's ever taken place and people take it as
[02:27:50.561 --> 02:27:52.363]  If they say it, it's got to be true.
[02:27:52.363 --> 02:28:01.852]  You know, you can give all the statistics on gun control, you can show all the pictures of people being shot in the head in trenches, but to the liberal, the agenda, okay?
[02:28:01.852 --> 02:28:07.678]  The agenda, listen, the liberal mindset is like Michael Savage says, in my opinion, it's a mental disorder.
[02:28:08.198 --> 02:28:17.703]  And what's happening is that you have almost a universal nightmare of denial going on in the masses.
[02:28:17.703 --> 02:28:24.967]  But that's exactly what the globalists, the satanists, the luciferians, and the devil himself want.
[02:28:24.967 --> 02:28:27.988]  Their whole goal, I haven't read Childhood Zen in probably 20 years.
[02:28:29.949 --> 02:28:31.591]  Yeah, and Odyssey Clark was MI6.
[02:28:31.591 --> 02:28:37.757]  This is literally their plan, except it's humans thinking they're going to become a god and merge with it.
[02:28:37.757 --> 02:28:40.620]  But you take out the aliens, it's childhood's end.
[02:28:40.620 --> 02:28:41.261]  That's their plan.
[02:28:42.415 --> 02:28:49.900]  Well, absolutely, but also, look, we know that the Antichrist, the person who Antichrist means takes the place of Jesus Christ.
[02:28:49.900 --> 02:28:53.483]  Jesus said, I came, you received me, not another will come claiming to be me.
[02:28:53.483 --> 02:28:56.025]  That's why they need this false world war.
[02:28:56.025 --> 02:29:04.171]  They need the World War III, which then the Antichrist will claim is Armageddon, and he now is the Christ in place of Jesus Christ.
[02:29:04.171 --> 02:29:11.216]  And the point is, is that it's a spiritual war, but unfortunately, Alex, all the prophecies of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Zechariah,
[02:29:11.716 --> 02:29:22.161]  You know, Daniel, Hosea, Amos, all the Old Testament prophets, we're in the times right now that they prophesied and people say, I don't believe all that stuff.
[02:29:22.161 --> 02:29:32.346]  Well, then you explain to me how this could all come about with a global mind outside of an entity apart from that global mind orchestrating it.
[02:29:32.346 --> 02:29:36.148]  I call it the symphony from hell and Lucifer as its conductor.
[02:29:36.348 --> 02:29:45.699]  And everything they're doing is pushing an end to your individual consciousness and buying into this larger consciousness, but it's not a good consciousness you're buying into.
[02:29:45.699 --> 02:29:46.700]  It's pure death.
[02:29:46.700 --> 02:29:47.541]  It hates you.
[02:29:47.541 --> 02:29:48.442]  More calls coming up.
[02:29:48.442 --> 02:29:49.824]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.824 --> 02:29:52.347]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.347 --> 02:29:55.030]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.224 --> 02:30:00.645]  Are you looking for affordable housing?
[02:30:00.645 --> 02:30:02.846]  Well, check out these headlines.
[02:30:02.846 --> 02:30:05.407]  60,000 New Yorkers sign up for tiny house development.
[02:30:05.407 --> 02:30:07.689]  265 square foot apartments.
[02:30:07.689 --> 02:30:10.390]  But would you pay $3,000 a month for this?
[02:30:10.390 --> 02:30:14.992]  Next, inside NYC's impossibly small 100 square foot apartment.
[02:30:14.992 --> 02:30:16.953]  It only goes for $2,800 a month.
[02:30:16.953 --> 02:30:19.515]  Or how about life in a 90 square foot box?
[02:30:19.515 --> 02:30:24.397]  Woman's apartment takes cramped New York living to the extreme, but she's living in the West Village for just $7.75 a month.
[02:30:25.538 --> 02:30:26.699]  And here's one out of New York.
[02:30:55.518 --> 02:30:58.982]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:30:58.982 --> 02:31:02.486]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:02.486 --> 02:31:10.735]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:10.735 --> 02:31:15.741]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:31:16.141 --> 02:31:18.665]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[02:31:58.607 --> 02:32:05.512]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[02:32:05.512 --> 02:32:08.414]  We've always offered five months free.
[02:32:08.414 --> 02:32:14.298]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[02:32:14.298 --> 02:32:17.740]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[02:32:17.740 --> 02:32:20.702]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.

[02:33:11.563 --> 02:33:22.388]  Look, I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen, but it does happen.
[02:33:22.388 --> 02:33:29.831]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.831 --> 02:33:32.992]  The supernatural would be radio a thousand years ago.
[02:33:32.992 --> 02:33:37.714]  Supernatural just means something that isn't known, isn't in the visible light spectrum.
[02:33:41.570 --> 02:33:50.115]  But I was thinking about the allegory of Childhood's End, and we're going back to your calls because Steve Quayle brought it up that I'm going to get into the whole World War scenario with Russia.
[02:33:50.115 --> 02:33:59.281]  But if you look at that plot of Childhood's End, not the miniseries, I haven't seen it, but I'm told it's different on SyFy Channel.
[02:34:00.305 --> 02:34:21.629]  But the book itself, written by the inventor of the communications satellite, and a bunch of other stuff, MI6 futurist, MI6 mastermind, the late, great Arthur C. Clarke, he realized that all of his books were an allegory, and he actually wrote essays on this, admitting it, that like, 2001 is a parable.
[02:34:21.629 --> 02:34:29.531]  Because, you know, only one human transcends and goes to the Stargate, and he's gotta defeat the
[02:34:31.149 --> 02:34:36.613]  AI first, the artificial intelligence, his own creation, which the elite admit they expect to have a battle with.
[02:34:36.613 --> 02:34:38.915]  I mean, these people, this is a religion, folks.
[02:34:38.915 --> 02:34:41.197]  This is all planned out.
[02:34:41.197 --> 02:34:49.563]  And then if they can create AI, harness it, control it, then they're gonna go and be these star children and the new sun will be born Lucifer.
[02:34:49.563 --> 02:34:53.466]  I mean, that's the plot of those three books.
[02:34:53.466 --> 02:34:57.209]  Gee, I wonder what he's telling you when the new star is called Lucifer, the new god's born.
[02:34:57.209 --> 02:35:00.672]  The humans go to the dimension, come back, ignite the sun,
[02:35:02.708 --> 02:35:03.568]  They're a new God.
[02:35:03.568 --> 02:35:09.670]  And they said they can take us there.
[02:35:09.670 --> 02:35:12.010]  They got a brand new God.
[02:35:12.010 --> 02:35:14.331]  And they can slay us there.
[02:35:14.331 --> 02:35:17.331]  They can kill us there, so we can be reborn.
[02:35:17.331 --> 02:35:20.012]  They got a brand new God.
[02:35:20.012 --> 02:35:21.412]  Brand new God.
[02:35:21.412 --> 02:35:23.653]  That's what they're telling us.
[02:35:25.063 --> 02:35:26.644]  And that's it.
[02:35:26.644 --> 02:35:27.545]  Oh, free healthcare.
[02:35:27.545 --> 02:35:28.346]  Oh, free goodies.
[02:35:28.346 --> 02:35:29.106]  Oh, free shots.
[02:35:29.106 --> 02:35:30.027]  Oh, we're gonna help you.
[02:35:30.027 --> 02:35:34.030]  But it's not even like Childhood's End, where they give you the shot and you live an extra hundred years.
[02:35:34.030 --> 02:35:40.675]  They give you the shot, you fall down and have to start having convulsions!
[02:35:40.675 --> 02:35:53.124]  That's how incredible the mind control is, is the inserts on the vaccines say they don't protect you, say they can kill you, say they can give you all these disorders, lowers your immunity to the flu,
[02:35:55.302 --> 02:35:57.743]  And people look at me and they go, that can't be true.
[02:35:57.743 --> 02:35:58.784]  The system's good.
[02:35:58.784 --> 02:36:01.505]  And I go, just read the insert, please, please, please.
[02:36:01.505 --> 02:36:05.406]  No, I'm not going to.
[02:36:05.406 --> 02:36:08.588]  And there is that mass Stockholm syndrome.
[02:36:08.588 --> 02:36:14.130]  My term, mass Stockholm syndrome.
[02:36:14.130 --> 02:36:15.871]  And again, it's that paradox of
[02:36:19.329 --> 02:36:38.598]  Most people that actually work in the CIA or the FBI or all these different agencies or contractors themselves are either ideologues who are compartmentalized and believe what they're doing or they're completely freaked out, completely whacked out and completely scared and they're just trying to do the limited amount of bad they can.
[02:36:38.598 --> 02:36:40.199]  That's not going to save any of you people.
[02:36:40.199 --> 02:36:41.380]  We're going to go to your calls, Ray.
[02:36:43.052 --> 02:36:47.775]  Mike and Chris and Karen and Maya, Steve Quayle, SteveQuayle.com is our guest.
[02:36:47.775 --> 02:36:55.400]  You can look at Steve Quayle's view of the world and say, man, that's pretty far out, some of it, but I thought it was basically 50% far out 20 years ago.
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:36:57.641]  Now I think it's like 10% far out.
[02:36:57.641 --> 02:37:03.064]  But the point is, whatever the truth is, every time we finally learn it, it's even freakier!
[02:37:03.064 --> 02:37:05.206]  And I go back to that paradox, Steve, when we're going to these calls.
[02:37:07.136 --> 02:37:23.604]  How is it, I've noticed this, that if I have an actual army.mil document that's on army.mil saying that they are preparing hundreds of thousands of employees and private contractors to man emergency centers with re-education camps for the American people.
[02:37:23.604 --> 02:37:25.825]  In fact, guys just type in re-education camp army manual.
[02:37:27.719 --> 02:37:29.240]  No one attacks me on it.
[02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:30.861]  No one says it's not true.
[02:37:30.861 --> 02:37:32.102]  There's no Rachel Maddow.
[02:37:32.102 --> 02:37:33.082]  There's no CNN.
[02:37:33.082 --> 02:37:36.584]  There's no... They'll just go make up something I said and attack that strawman.
[02:37:36.584 --> 02:37:43.328]  They'll never... They know it's real, FM39-40 and others.
[02:37:43.328 --> 02:37:44.769]  But they won't even address it.
[02:37:44.769 --> 02:37:47.550]  I mean, you've been around these people.
[02:37:47.550 --> 02:37:48.391]  I mean, I've been around them.
[02:37:49.500 --> 02:38:01.847]  What's weird is, at that level though, they're so sycophantic and such cowards, they're not like some special forces captain or colonel or general, totally freaked out, hiding out in the middle of nowhere with their family because they know too much.
[02:38:01.847 --> 02:38:04.729]  At least they don't love it and think it's cute because they're real people.
[02:38:04.729 --> 02:38:07.451]  It's these soft, weird cowards are the ultimate
[02:38:08.564 --> 02:38:10.344]  Progenitor of the takeover.
[02:38:10.344 --> 02:38:13.405]  They're giving birth to it because they never were on hard times.
[02:38:13.405 --> 02:38:14.985]  They never got beat up.
[02:38:14.985 --> 02:38:16.745]  They never went through real hell.
[02:38:16.745 --> 02:38:18.166]  They never saw real evil.
[02:38:18.166 --> 02:38:36.409]  They're divorced from it, sitting back with the instrumentality of high-tech enslavement, playing the instrument like they're virtuosos, proud of themselves, not seeing that they stand in the jaws of a huge, stinking,
[02:38:38.101 --> 02:38:43.704]  red-eyed anglerfish that is their papa, but it isn't their papa.
[02:38:43.704 --> 02:38:48.687]  I mean, they don't get that at the top of the pyramid, you can smell the death.
[02:38:48.687 --> 02:38:50.168]  You can see it.
[02:38:50.168 --> 02:38:53.930]  Those of us, it's just like, oh my God, the smoke coming out of it.
[02:38:53.930 --> 02:38:55.531]  I mean, I don't even want to get close to it.
[02:38:55.531 --> 02:38:58.913]  It just reeks of directly out of the pit of hell.
[02:38:58.913 --> 02:39:05.077]  I mean, death to this planet, engineered spiritual virus meant to shut us down and kill us.
[02:39:05.797 --> 02:39:15.964]  And then they just sit there hopping around rejoicing when they're the biggest schmuck, chump, idiots I've ever seen in my life.
[02:39:15.964 --> 02:39:34.198]  I mean, they are such born losers that they think they're actually part of the winning team when history and everything shows, and what's currently happening, that this system will personally tear its minions to part because they're totally unprotected spiritually.
[02:39:34.818 --> 02:39:39.585]  I mean, I just don't know how they don't see the incredible peril they're in.
[02:39:39.585 --> 02:39:41.368]  Because they're such cowards.
[02:39:41.368 --> 02:39:49.020]  But they're so cowardly, they convince themselves they're safe when they're in the most dangerous position they could be in.
[02:39:49.020 --> 02:39:49.641]  Go ahead, my friend.
[02:39:50.771 --> 02:40:07.066]  Well, first of all, Alex, you know, I couldn't agree more wholeheartedly, and even passages in the Old Testament talk about all these rich and powerful people, when they are in hell, and they see Lucifer there, too, and they're saying, is this the man that caused the nations to tremble?
[02:40:07.066 --> 02:40:12.691]  I want to draw attention to something I received today, and I think you just received it a couple hours ago, so I want you to
[02:40:13.391 --> 02:40:20.074]  I just posted a couple hours ago, it's a conversation, one paragraph about what they're doing to come take the guns away, okay?
[02:40:20.074 --> 02:40:22.715]  It's between a guy named Jim and Michael.
[02:40:22.715 --> 02:40:28.197]  He said, the guy said, Steve, I sent a friend the link, the story about the testing gun confiscation in Illinois.
[02:40:28.197 --> 02:40:30.858]  He worked for the Sheriff's Department for 25 years.
[02:40:30.858 --> 02:40:32.659]  Here's his reply today.
[02:40:32.659 --> 02:40:35.880]  I would have said there's no way this is going to happen.
[02:40:36.460 --> 02:40:44.606]  My son worked with a man that told her his son, a Marine, was training for gun confiscation in a war in the boundaries of the U.S.
[02:40:44.606 --> 02:40:50.930]  His son has been training down south and the dad spoke with him before November and this was what the son told dad.
[02:40:50.930 --> 02:40:54.973]  Time to make sure your kit, in other words your prepper supply, are ready and sound.
[02:40:54.973 --> 02:40:57.415]  Civil War II is almost ready to start.
[02:40:57.415 --> 02:41:01.898]  It sounds to me like, it sounds to me, when do you want to sit down and talk?
[02:41:01.898 --> 02:41:02.699]  Question mark.
[02:41:02.699 --> 02:41:04.460]  God help us, Michael.
[02:41:04.460 --> 02:41:05.981]  So, Alex, the thing is, look,
[02:41:06.890 --> 02:41:18.935]  We've laid out over and over and over thousands of hours of broadcasts, thousands of documents, thousands of news links, thousands of interviews, okay?
[02:41:18.935 --> 02:41:20.496]  Literally.
[02:41:20.496 --> 02:41:23.637]  And telling people from insiders this is coming.
[02:41:24.545 --> 02:41:26.988]  And it's, you know, it's the four monkeys.
[02:41:26.988 --> 02:41:33.516]  Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil, and certainly don't speak out against evil.
[02:41:33.516 --> 02:41:37.121]  And now it's manifesting openly as they prepare to go operational.
[02:41:37.121 --> 02:41:38.402]  And I'm going to say this.
[02:41:38.402 --> 02:41:39.063]  Make no mistake.
[02:41:39.844 --> 02:42:06.140]  We're here at the castle gates, there's holes knocked through the armored door, there's flames shooting out, there's rocks being hurtled over, and then we're sitting here with countless other patriots around the world of every race, color, and creed, trying to hold the gates up, and then all these trendies are sitting around bitching, going, I don't see any enemies, I don't see any problems, I don't see any takeover, waiting for those gates to crumble and fall.
[02:42:06.140 --> 02:42:08.342]  Undoubtedly, if it wasn't for Ron Paul,
[02:42:09.474 --> 02:42:15.822]  And countless others, patriots out there over the years, exposing this from Barry Goldwater to you name it.
[02:42:16.909 --> 02:42:18.629]  We'd already be in this system.
[02:42:18.629 --> 02:42:21.030]  So I love how we're trying to hold it back.
[02:42:21.030 --> 02:42:25.211]  Undoubtedly, the globalists admit what the new order is about 15 years behind.
[02:42:25.211 --> 02:42:26.472]  And then they're bitching at us.
[02:42:26.472 --> 02:42:27.892]  And now we've finally been pushed back.
[02:42:27.892 --> 02:42:28.992]  We're sliding.
[02:42:28.992 --> 02:42:30.413]  World government's being announced.
[02:42:30.413 --> 02:42:32.273]  We're all being verified.
[02:42:32.273 --> 02:42:40.555]  That's why they're bringing in the censorship now to shut us up and shut us down, because now they know our credibility is about to explode.
[02:42:40.555 --> 02:42:41.776]  How do you see the brakes on this?
[02:42:41.776 --> 02:42:42.376]  And we're going to calls.
[02:42:43.407 --> 02:42:45.408]  Well, you know, I can tell you something.
[02:42:45.408 --> 02:42:50.289]  Mushroom clouds speak louder than piss-poor excuses, okay?
[02:42:50.289 --> 02:42:54.510]  I'm sorry for the word, but that's the only way I know how to explain it right now.
[02:42:54.510 --> 02:43:00.192]  Alex, it is insanity that people are hearing World War III, seeing World War III,
[02:43:00.652 --> 02:43:17.291]  Hearing about overflights of different nations, bombers, and submarines off our coasts, and still you've got a guy that goes on vacation, and the Middle East is inflamed, and people, you know, I gotta tell you something, Assad of Syria is the only guy standing up for Christians!
[02:43:17.791 --> 02:43:25.215]  The point is that if you can't even put two and two together to equal four, we go into Iraq, we totally destabilize it.
[02:43:25.215 --> 02:43:28.857]  We go into Libya, we totally destroy it and destabilize it.
[02:43:28.857 --> 02:43:33.819]  We have destabilized, destabilized, but it all fits the plan of global upheaval.
[02:43:33.819 --> 02:43:42.644]  In that global upheaval, a Western nation that turned from fighting terrorism has now turned internal.
[02:43:43.024 --> 02:43:45.566]  And all of the terrorists are inside the gate.
[02:43:45.566 --> 02:43:47.668]  The barbarians are outside the gate.
[02:43:47.668 --> 02:43:50.149]  And what we're fighting for is the last life.
[02:43:50.149 --> 02:43:51.610]  The last husband who gets it.
[02:43:51.610 --> 02:43:53.312]  The last wife who gets it.
[02:43:53.312 --> 02:43:58.215]  We're saying, God, people, and I'm saying, I'm praying, not using the name Lord in vain.
[02:43:58.215 --> 02:44:01.177]  I'm saying, God, help the people's eyes to be open.
[02:44:01.177 --> 02:44:04.700]  But the bottom line is when people embrace the occult.
[02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:12.969]  I can tell you this, Alex, and I gotta share this, I lay it out so clearly in Empire Beneath the Ice, how the Nazis won World War II.
[02:44:12.969 --> 02:44:23.101]  You cannot separate the darkest forces, everything that you consider evil, that you articulate as evil, you cannot separate that from what's going on in our government.
[02:44:23.101 --> 02:44:24.002]  And they brought it with them.
[02:44:24.022 --> 02:44:28.569]  We're selling the baby parts, funding the radicalizers to kill the Christians.
[02:44:28.569 --> 02:44:37.261]  You see our government go out of its way to do evil things, even though it hurts the interest of those elites, because it's not about money.
[02:44:38.331 --> 02:44:41.512]  It is about prosecuting a war and an old score.
[02:44:41.512 --> 02:44:43.473]  And so it's ancient Russia.
[02:44:43.473 --> 02:44:45.073]  It's ancient Syria.
[02:44:45.073 --> 02:44:50.535]  Not that they're even perfect, but they know in the globalist plan they are slated for destruction.
[02:44:50.535 --> 02:44:52.656]  So they are fighting.
[02:44:52.656 --> 02:44:56.837]  Because they have not been fully taken under the spell of the New World Order.
[02:44:56.837 --> 02:44:57.958]  Let's go to some calls here.
[02:44:57.958 --> 02:44:59.538]  Very well said, Steve Quayle.
[02:44:59.538 --> 02:45:01.119]  Let's talk to Ray in Iowa.
[02:45:01.119 --> 02:45:02.079]  Thank you for holding.
[02:45:02.079 --> 02:45:02.819]  Up next, Mike.
[02:45:02.819 --> 02:45:04.740]  Go ahead.
[02:45:04.740 --> 02:45:06.801]  This is Ray in Iowa.
[02:45:06.801 --> 02:45:07.041]  Go ahead.
[02:45:07.970 --> 02:45:11.293]  Oh yeah, hey listen, blessings my brothers.
[02:45:11.293 --> 02:45:12.794]  I have a question.
[02:45:12.794 --> 02:45:21.180]  I was stationed over in Germany during the Cold War and you know, a lot of the rumors were that Hitler had gotten out of there.
[02:45:21.180 --> 02:45:30.647]  In fact, you had talked about that earlier in the show, Steve Quayle, that you had been following that on the History Channel, hunting Hitler.
[02:45:30.647 --> 02:45:36.211]  And I had been kind of following that as well and I guess my question would be at this point is,
[02:45:37.104 --> 02:45:42.718]  Certainly Putin or the Russians must know that he got out of there.
[02:45:42.718 --> 02:45:44.964]  Oh, they do?
[02:45:44.964 --> 02:45:45.385]  Excuse me?
[02:45:45.993 --> 02:45:46.974]  Yeah, they do.
[02:45:46.974 --> 02:45:50.316]  Stalin said, and I'll quote Stalin, that bastard got away.
[02:45:50.316 --> 02:45:54.279]  And that's what even Putin, you know, you're, you're, you're, you're really onto something here.
[02:45:54.279 --> 02:46:01.405]  Putin made claims about, they're not going to sit back and watch the resurrection of the Nazis.
[02:46:01.405 --> 02:46:03.486]  They will not sit back and do it.
[02:46:03.486 --> 02:46:05.948]  So what I think you're going for, caller, is a fact.
[02:46:05.948 --> 02:46:06.789]  Yes, they do.
[02:46:06.789 --> 02:46:08.930]  And Putin is starting to blow the lid.
[02:46:08.930 --> 02:46:13.534]  My guess is he's going to blow the lid on the whole Nazi control.
[02:46:14.054 --> 02:46:18.779]  They studied that Hitler skull, it was a female skull, it's not even a male skull.
[02:46:18.779 --> 02:46:21.402]  Eisenhower said there's no evidence Hitler died.
[02:46:21.402 --> 02:46:28.188]  And then look, even hunting Hitler, for the record Alex, I started my book eight months before the first story broke on Hitler.
[02:46:28.188 --> 02:46:34.475]  So I would say this, I would say that people need to understand the occult, the Luciferian agenda.
[02:46:34.475 --> 02:46:36.617]  You cannot, the Nazis,
[02:46:37.097 --> 02:46:39.960]  Opened the first Stargates the beyond the ancients.
[02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:57.114]  Okay in contemporary time and people say well, I don't believe in that Well, it doesn't matter what you believe in every Native American site in the United States around the world has spirals indicating Stargate So I didn't mean to cut the collar off But he's really on to something and the Russians are ready to play that revelation soon in my opinion
[02:46:57.779 --> 02:47:04.485]  Well, you notice Putin's coming out saying global warming's the plan to take over the world and enslave everybody, that the Western governments run the drug trade.
[02:47:04.485 --> 02:47:16.195]  I mean, Putin is exposing everything, and he wasn't doing that just a few years ago, but when they started shutting down Russia, putting the sanctions on, he really is spilling the beans on them.
[02:47:16.195 --> 02:47:21.200]  Who do you think Putin is, and who are the Russians in this whole history?
[02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:24.483]  Because in mainline evangelical CIA-run
[02:47:25.678 --> 02:47:28.240]  Influence Christianity and mob bashing evangelicals.
[02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:30.782]  That's who they targeted because it's such a good group of people.
[02:47:30.782 --> 02:47:32.684]  They try to pump that Russia's the enemy.
[02:47:32.684 --> 02:47:37.147]  And obviously Russia was a globalist evil created by the globalists.
[02:47:37.147 --> 02:47:38.368]  The Soviets were horrible.
[02:47:38.368 --> 02:47:39.549]  Communism is horrible.
[02:47:39.549 --> 02:47:40.790]  You look at what we have here today.
[02:47:40.790 --> 02:47:42.952]  That's exactly what they're now establishing.
[02:47:42.952 --> 02:47:44.393]  But what has Russia become now?
[02:47:45.356 --> 02:47:50.659]  Well, I think Putin has gone back to his Christian, when I say Christian, Russian Orthodox roots.
[02:47:50.659 --> 02:47:52.920]  I think he's shown remarkable restraint.
[02:47:52.920 --> 02:48:07.867]  I also believe that you've seen, basically, a topsy-turvy, where the United States used to, quote, be Christian largely, you know, and no matter what the entity says, we were founded, at least on Christian principles.
[02:48:07.867 --> 02:48:14.410]  The idea is that Putin now, as the head priest of the Russian Orthodox Church, blessing his men,
[02:48:14.910 --> 02:48:15.050]  And I
[02:48:38.061 --> 02:48:47.771]  That's always been part of the larger plan, is have us carry out the globalist agenda, then we get the blame, then the EU and the Chinese basically merge, giving us the blame for everything.
[02:48:47.771 --> 02:48:51.896]  And I do see in some of their plans, they do want to knock the US out and Russia out in the end.
[02:48:52.810 --> 02:48:57.593]  Well, Russia knows the Chinese are its biggest adversary, and let me share this.
[02:48:57.593 --> 02:49:02.336]  Strange bedfellows, and the enemies, you know, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[02:49:02.336 --> 02:49:06.319]  That only goes as long as, you know, you have a mutual enemy.
[02:49:06.319 --> 02:49:16.726]  Russia knows that it cannot compete with China's industrial base from the standpoint of sheer amount of population, but Russia leads in high-energy physics and weapons.
[02:49:16.726 --> 02:49:18.707]  They have some of the most sophisticated systems.
[02:49:18.707 --> 02:49:21.669]  Their fighters aren't built with Chinese parts.
[02:49:22.109 --> 02:49:33.918]  The point being, our F-35 is, and look, every time, whether it's a Donald Cook forcing a nuclear sub-boomer to surface or taking out aircraft, the Russians are saying, don't you understand what we can do?
[02:49:33.918 --> 02:49:50.690]  So I think Putin, I don't think he's rushing headlong into nuclear war, but I believe he knows that this government, under the control of the entities behind the curtain, are pushing for nuclear war, and he has a philosophy, I want people to hear this, the Russian philosophy is, you strike first.
[02:49:51.991 --> 02:50:00.153]  Well, if you expand and look at all of this, we have crazy people running this country.
[02:50:00.153 --> 02:50:03.274]  And they really are out to get anybody who's self-sufficient.
[02:50:03.274 --> 02:50:04.174]  I mean, that's what it comes down to.
[02:50:04.174 --> 02:50:07.555]  They want you under their cult control.
[02:50:07.555 --> 02:50:09.916]  Let's see who's been holding the longest here.
[02:50:09.916 --> 02:50:11.756]  Let's go to Mike and then Chris.
[02:50:11.756 --> 02:50:13.077]  Mike, you're on the air from Texas.
[02:50:13.077 --> 02:50:13.357]  Welcome.
[02:50:15.236 --> 02:50:16.697]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:50:16.697 --> 02:50:22.102]  I just wanted to know if you or Steve Coyle have heard of Dr. Steven Greer.
[02:50:22.102 --> 02:50:31.210]  He is trying to expose a secret government that handles all the secret bases and things like that.
[02:50:31.210 --> 02:50:32.411]  Yeah, I mean, I'm aware of that.
[02:50:32.411 --> 02:50:33.952]  Look, here's the deal.
[02:50:34.927 --> 02:50:41.630]  I can't get people to look at the National Security Act of 1947 that's public, or the NGOs, or the continuity of government programs.
[02:50:41.630 --> 02:50:43.471]  It's all there and admitted.
[02:50:43.471 --> 02:50:48.413]  And all the people I see always talking about secret bases, this, stuff, that, it's all conjecture and hearsay.
[02:50:48.413 --> 02:50:57.337]  And then no one will look at all the admissions of what Eisenhower warned about in 1961 in his farewell address of the technological elite in a breakaway civilization.
[02:50:59.415 --> 02:51:06.522]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country.
[02:51:06.522 --> 02:51:10.506]  It caught me totally by surprise and it involves FEMA.
[02:51:10.506 --> 02:51:13.909]  I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof.
[02:51:13.909 --> 02:51:18.994]  Revealing their secret could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[02:51:19.594 --> 02:51:30.118]  Watch the viral video at FEMA3.com before it disappears again, but be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is, they must know something we don't.
[02:51:30.118 --> 02:51:40.142]  Go to FEMA3.com to see the number one item you should be hoarding and why supplies of this critical item are so low or even completely sold out at many stores across America.
[02:51:40.842 --> 02:51:42.063]  Don't miss out.
[02:51:42.063 --> 02:51:47.265]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in recent days.
[02:51:47.265 --> 02:51:52.868]  Go to FEMA3.com and discover the number one most critical item in a crisis.
[02:51:52.868 --> 02:51:56.510]  Watch the shocking video right now at FEMA3.com.
[02:51:56.510 --> 02:51:57.650]  Again, that's FEMA3.com.
[02:51:59.091 --> 02:52:02.274]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[02:52:02.274 --> 02:52:04.636]  Deep Cleanse by Infowarslife.com.
[02:52:04.636 --> 02:52:11.662]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[02:52:16.966 --> 02:52:25.994]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.
[02:52:26.374 --> 02:52:35.267]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[02:52:35.267 --> 02:52:42.158]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigerex herbal processing technique.
[02:52:42.358 --> 02:52:48.700]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.

[02:52:57.582 --> 02:53:02.063]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.
[02:53:02.063 --> 02:53:05.544]  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[02:53:06.761 --> 02:53:10.243]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[02:53:10.243 --> 02:53:15.686]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[02:53:15.686 --> 02:53:17.186]  How is this even possible?
[02:53:17.186 --> 02:53:24.710]  Turns out, the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[02:53:24.710 --> 02:53:32.354]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[02:53:32.354 --> 02:53:35.576]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[02:53:35.836 --> 02:53:43.662]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[02:53:43.662 --> 02:53:46.824]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping.
[02:53:46.824 --> 02:53:50.947]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[02:53:50.947 --> 02:53:51.648]  That's Greens75.com.
[02:53:51.648 --> 02:53:52.048]  Greens75.com.
[02:54:09.048 --> 02:54:15.570]  Rob Dew is coming up host in the fourth hour, and he's got a ton of breaking news and information he's going to be covering.
[02:54:15.570 --> 02:54:18.651]  I want to try to go to more of your calls in this segment than the next.
[02:54:18.651 --> 02:54:30.634]  I'm not going to belabor this, but you hear my sponsors when I'm endorsing a product by name, and you also hear the products that I endorse that we sell at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:54:30.634 --> 02:54:31.995]  The Radio Network are great folks.
[02:54:31.995 --> 02:54:33.635]  They've got their sponsors.
[02:54:33.635 --> 02:54:34.716]  I'm sure a lot of them are great.
[02:54:34.716 --> 02:54:35.456]  I can't speak for them.
[02:54:36.465 --> 02:54:41.026]  When you hear me say that Survival Shield Nacin Iodine X2 has changed my life, it really did.
[02:54:41.026 --> 02:54:44.027]  What I'm talking about is super male vitality.
[02:54:44.027 --> 02:54:51.969]  Just a bunch of known, organic, cold-pressed herbs has done for my energy, my libido, my weight loss.
[02:54:51.969 --> 02:54:54.229]  I mean, it's been staggering what's happened.
[02:54:54.229 --> 02:54:55.450]  Super female vitality.
[02:54:55.450 --> 02:54:59.571]  I mean, just give it a try, and then you're funding the operation.
[02:54:59.571 --> 02:55:03.932]  But I believe you're going to come back and get more, because almost everybody does, because it's so good.
[02:55:05.677 --> 02:55:08.821]  We have 15% off throughout the whole store.
[02:55:08.821 --> 02:55:09.882]  That's what it is.
[02:55:09.882 --> 02:55:14.989]  With promo code at the end of it.
[02:55:14.989 --> 02:55:17.552]  Promo code GIFT15.
[02:55:17.552 --> 02:55:24.541]  But it's to encourage folks to use those gift cards that most people don't end up, you know, using all the money off of them.
[02:55:25.435 --> 02:55:25.835]  We're good to go.
[02:55:43.803 --> 02:55:47.608]  Well, they'll have garden organizations in your area.
[02:55:47.608 --> 02:55:50.231]  Or go out in the middle on the side of the highway and plant stuff.
[02:55:50.231 --> 02:55:53.114]  Gorilla planting is going on everywhere.
[02:55:53.114 --> 02:55:55.898]  Where people are planting fruit trees, you name it, on the side of the highway.
[02:55:55.898 --> 02:55:57.019]  They're growing, they're doing great.
[02:55:57.019 --> 02:56:00.123]  I mean, this is really cool stuff you can do.
[02:56:00.123 --> 02:56:00.604]  To plant.
[02:56:01.653 --> 02:56:08.415]  The opposite of what the globalists are planning, these devil plants that don't produce seeds and spread all these bad genetics.
[02:56:08.415 --> 02:56:11.136]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:56:11.136 --> 02:56:13.017]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:56:13.017 --> 02:56:15.098]  And the Hillary for Prison shirts are selling out.
[02:56:15.098 --> 02:56:16.458]  They're a limited edition.
[02:56:16.458 --> 02:56:17.599]  There are a few sizes left.
[02:56:17.599 --> 02:56:19.559]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:56:19.559 --> 02:56:22.460]  We've got Steve Quayle with us.
[02:56:22.460 --> 02:56:24.721]  Let's go ahead and take another phone call for him.
[02:56:24.721 --> 02:56:26.282]  Let's talk to Ned in Oregon.
[02:56:26.282 --> 02:56:27.322]  You're on the air with Steve Quayle.
[02:56:29.638 --> 02:56:30.678]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:56:30.678 --> 02:56:31.018]  Go ahead.
[02:56:31.018 --> 02:56:33.099]  I'm glad I got a chance to talk to both of you.
[02:56:33.099 --> 02:56:45.462]  I wanted to have you address, both of you, I know AJ is involved, has known about David Icke for a long time, how David Icke's reptilian interaction and Luciferian thing keep on going on that direction.
[02:56:45.462 --> 02:56:50.883]  I still think that those reptilians are a big part of the problem, and I'll take the answer off air.
[02:56:50.883 --> 02:56:51.083]  Thanks.
[02:56:52.145 --> 02:56:54.806]  Well, here's the deal, and I'll get Steve to comment on this.
[02:56:54.806 --> 02:56:56.267]  I don't get into space aliens.
[02:56:56.267 --> 02:56:57.748]  I don't get into all that.
[02:56:57.748 --> 02:57:01.270]  The elite act like vampires.
[02:57:01.270 --> 02:57:04.572]  The royal family in England is Transylvanian, related to Vlad the Impaler.
[02:57:04.572 --> 02:57:06.333]  You can't make that up.
[02:57:06.333 --> 02:57:08.274]  A lot of dead kids have been dug up on their property.
[02:57:08.274 --> 02:57:10.135]  David Icke,
[02:57:10.675 --> 02:57:13.417]  Twenty-something years ago, you know, I was accusing them of killing kids.
[02:57:13.417 --> 02:57:23.843]  And ten years ago, on my show, I was naming names of people like Savelle at the BBC saying, you know, he had sex with dead kids and they slit their throats in front of the Prime Minister.
[02:57:23.843 --> 02:57:27.305]  And I remember delaying David Eigen saying, you can't say that on air.
[02:57:27.305 --> 02:57:27.565]  Okay?
[02:57:30.427 --> 02:57:31.687]  Then it all came out was true.
[02:57:31.687 --> 02:57:35.689]  So, at this point, I mean, Katie, bar the door, who knows?
[02:57:35.689 --> 02:57:39.070]  But they might as well be eight-foot tall, blood-drinking lizards.
[02:57:39.070 --> 02:57:40.771]  I mean, they act just like them.
[02:57:40.771 --> 02:57:42.892]  I mean, whether they are or aren't, might as well be.
[02:57:42.892 --> 02:57:43.352]  Steve Quayle?
[02:57:44.434 --> 02:57:45.695]  Well, I gotta tell you something.
[02:57:45.695 --> 02:57:48.936]  I think that's evil-like compared to what's coming upon the Earth.
[02:57:48.936 --> 02:57:54.319]  Jesus said men's hearts failing them for fear of looking after those things coming up on the Earth.
[02:57:54.319 --> 02:57:58.821]  You know, Alex, again, I'm trying in the last, uh, how many months of freedom we have.
[02:57:58.821 --> 02:58:01.242]  If it goes five, six, I don't know.
[02:58:01.242 --> 02:58:03.223]  Next week, next year, I don't know.
[02:58:03.223 --> 02:58:05.024]  But what I do know is this.
[02:58:05.024 --> 02:58:10.527]  Our time of being able to inform and the people's time of being able to prepare.
[02:58:10.527 --> 02:58:12.868]  It's a clash of the titans.
[02:58:13.508 --> 02:58:16.409]  And they'd better make the best use they can.
[02:58:16.409 --> 02:58:21.110]  And that, and by the way, I think, and I'll say this on your show, this is the last book I'm writing.
[02:58:21.110 --> 02:58:23.391]  I basically, I think I've covered it all.
[02:58:23.391 --> 02:58:24.731]  It is the end result.
[02:58:24.731 --> 02:58:32.113]  It's the, uh, if you will, it's both the root and fruit of the evil coming upon the earth, the, you know, empire beneath the ice.
[02:58:32.113 --> 02:58:36.234]  And the deal is from now on, I'm going into videos through legends because you
[02:58:36.414 --> 02:58:37.175]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:58:37.175 --> 02:58:38.517]  I want to come back to you.
[02:58:38.517 --> 02:58:40.719]  Final segment, then we hand the baton to Rob Deuce.
[02:58:40.719 --> 02:58:41.520]  Spread the word, folks.
[02:58:41.520 --> 02:58:42.501]  Tell people to tune in.
[02:58:42.501 --> 02:58:43.723]  We've got to get out of our trance.
[02:58:43.723 --> 02:58:44.864]  We've got to get people awake.
[02:58:44.864 --> 02:58:45.866]  A lot of stuff's going on.
[02:58:48.973 --> 02:58:52.494]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:58:52.494 --> 02:59:00.736]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:59:00.736 --> 02:59:06.157]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:59:06.157 --> 02:59:08.678]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:59:08.678 --> 02:59:10.778]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[02:59:10.778 --> 02:59:14.979]  Secure your DNA force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:59:18.832 --> 02:59:19.932]  BrainForce is here.
[02:59:19.932 --> 02:59:22.133]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:59:22.133 --> 02:59:27.134]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:59:27.134 --> 02:59:28.834]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[02:59:28.834 --> 02:59:30.415]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:59:30.415 --> 02:59:33.896]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:59:33.896 --> 02:59:35.876]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:59:35.876 --> 02:59:36.796]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:59:36.796 --> 02:59:37.977]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:59:37.977 --> 02:59:39.997]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[02:59:39.997 --> 02:59:45.558]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:51.509 --> 02:59:54.125]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.950 --> 03:00:19.635]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:19.635 --> 03:00:23.438]  Empire Beneath the Ice, available exclusively at cql.com.
[03:00:23.438 --> 03:00:24.519]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:00:24.519 --> 03:00:26.160]  Infowars.com is our main site.
[03:00:26.160 --> 03:00:29.743]  A lot of big news is broken there in the last hour, I haven't gotten to.
[03:00:29.743 --> 03:00:34.326]  David Spade, Obama should have more dignity than to appear on reality TV.
[03:00:34.326 --> 03:00:35.067]  Why does that matter?
[03:00:35.067 --> 03:00:37.969]  So many Hollywood stars are going public against the Obamas.
[03:00:37.969 --> 03:00:40.130]  Kurt Russell for the Second Amendment, you name it.
[03:00:40.130 --> 03:00:42.032]  It shows there's major rumbling.
[03:00:43.447 --> 03:00:45.867]  And people don't, I always told you, they don't want to be Republican or Democrat.
[03:00:45.867 --> 03:00:46.968]  They want to be Libertarian.
[03:00:46.968 --> 03:00:47.788]  They want to be Patriots.
[03:00:47.788 --> 03:00:52.489]  What did Kurt Russell say word for word last week?
[03:00:52.489 --> 03:00:58.150]  So there is a lot of craziness going on, ladies and gentlemen, but there's also a good Lord above.
[03:00:58.150 --> 03:00:59.870]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Australia.
[03:00:59.870 --> 03:01:00.970]  You're on the air with Steve Quayle.
[03:01:00.970 --> 03:01:04.251]  Go ahead.
[03:01:04.251 --> 03:01:04.971]  Do me a big favor.
[03:01:04.971 --> 03:01:06.911]  Yeah, just turn your radio off and we'll hear from you.
[03:01:06.911 --> 03:01:08.952]  Thank you.
[03:01:08.952 --> 03:01:09.392]  Oh, okay.
[03:01:09.392 --> 03:01:10.572]  Just give me a sec, please.
[03:01:11.314 --> 03:01:27.681]  Yeah, one-on-one of radio, folks, is you gotta turn that radio pretty much off, or it'll create, with a ten-second delay or the internet delay, a big delay, and then folks sit there and talk to us while they listen to themselves, and it just doesn't seem to work out too well.
[03:01:27.681 --> 03:01:29.682]  But we'll see what happens with John.
[03:01:29.682 --> 03:01:32.023]  John, you back yet?
[03:01:32.023 --> 03:01:33.524]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, good, good.
[03:01:33.524 --> 03:01:34.284]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:01:34.284 --> 03:01:35.505]  Good, brother, go ahead.
[03:01:35.505 --> 03:01:36.165]  God bless you, go ahead.
[03:01:36.772 --> 03:01:46.119]  Yeah, I just wanted to ask Steve if he knows about the second beast that speaks like a dragon that has two horns like a lamb.
[03:01:46.119 --> 03:01:47.220]  What's his take on it?
[03:01:47.220 --> 03:01:54.846]  Because I know what it actually means, but if Steve could tell me, he may actually know, so he might be someone else who knows.
[03:01:55.706 --> 03:02:05.010]  Well, because of the time it would take to answer that, you know, send me an email, steve777 at stevequell.com, I'll answer you privately.
[03:02:05.010 --> 03:02:07.931]  It just takes too long and we're down to, what, the last three minutes, Alex?
[03:02:07.931 --> 03:02:11.873]  So we'd better, out of respect, go to the next call or whatever.
[03:02:11.873 --> 03:02:14.914]  But again, folks, if you don't believe in the Bible, that's your issue.
[03:02:14.914 --> 03:02:19.296]  The elites, I've been to Bohemian Grub, I've infiltrated it, they really believe this stuff.
[03:02:20.774 --> 03:02:22.735]  So, metaphysically, that's what we're dealing with.
[03:02:22.735 --> 03:02:28.279]  John, what do you think about all the craziness going on in the world?
[03:02:28.279 --> 03:02:30.760]  Oh, it's crazy.
[03:02:30.760 --> 03:02:34.122]  This is all being set up for the beast, for the little horn.
[03:02:34.122 --> 03:02:35.523]  That the ten horns give their power to?
[03:02:35.523 --> 03:02:41.527]  Yeah, yeah, and he's meant to knock out three.
[03:02:41.527 --> 03:02:42.167]  Absolutely.
[03:02:42.167 --> 03:02:43.828]  Let's go back to Steve Quayle here briefly.
[03:02:43.828 --> 03:02:44.468]  Thank you for the call.
[03:02:44.468 --> 03:02:45.809]  Call me again when you have more time, John.
[03:02:45.809 --> 03:02:47.910]  I'm sorry to squeeze in all these great callers.
[03:02:47.910 --> 03:02:48.551]  But Steve Quayle,
[03:02:49.833 --> 03:02:55.666]  Isn't it crazy that the UN has ten regions, three mega regions, and actually calls them kingdoms?
[03:02:55.666 --> 03:02:57.890]  I mean, they really are following the Bible.
[03:02:58.926 --> 03:02:59.987]  Well, absolutely.
[03:02:59.987 --> 03:03:02.888]  Actually, the Bible declared the end at the beginning.
[03:03:02.888 --> 03:03:08.291]  You know, the Bible says, surely the Lord God will do nothing except He reveals His secrets to His servants of prophets.
[03:03:08.291 --> 03:03:20.216]  We have the testimony of history, but see, people live in denial of the relevance of God, and you know, one of the literal words of the Lord we're seeing is, a wall unto the nation that forgets God.
[03:03:20.216 --> 03:03:22.838]  If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
[03:03:22.838 --> 03:03:22.978]  Sure.
[03:03:23.778 --> 03:03:27.000]  That's something that you have to deal with every day as well as I do.
[03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:31.163]  Lord, the foundations of this country are in effect destroyed.
[03:03:31.163 --> 03:03:43.252]  And if the salty earth won't stand up, speak up, and act up for that which is right, you know, look, we're a couple guys, and by the grace of God, we've got the influence we've got.
[03:03:44.432 --> 03:03:52.716]  But you know this Alex, you know from the flack you get and from still, the nothing changing, it's all waiting for the button to be pressed.
[03:03:52.716 --> 03:04:02.681]  People know, once the button's pressed, I'll put it into gun control terms, when they absolutely say they're going for the guns, that's when everything kicks into high gear in my opinion.
[03:04:03.161 --> 03:04:05.523]  Look, there is manifest evil taking over.
[03:04:05.523 --> 03:04:07.805]  If we don't admit it and say no, it takes over.
[03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:25.620]  Absolutely.
[03:04:25.620 --> 03:04:26.441]  Thanks Alex, bye bye.
[03:04:45.856 --> 03:04:51.284]  He's gonna come in here in the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock central time, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:04:51.284 --> 03:04:53.427]  Six months free when you sign up for a year right now.
[03:04:53.427 --> 03:04:56.171]  We've never offered a special like that at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:04:56.171 --> 03:04:57.133]  Take advantage of it.
[03:04:57.133 --> 03:04:57.834]  20 people can use it.
[03:04:58.976 --> 03:05:00.436]  Are you looking for affordable housing?
[03:05:00.436 --> 03:05:02.617]  Well, check out these headlines.
[03:05:02.617 --> 03:05:05.077]  60,000 New Yorkers sign up for tiny house development.
[03:05:05.077 --> 03:05:07.438]  265 square foot apartments.
[03:05:07.438 --> 03:05:10.139]  But would you pay $3,000 a month for this?
[03:05:10.139 --> 03:05:14.740]  Next, inside NYC's impossibly small 100 square foot apartment.
[03:05:14.740 --> 03:05:16.700]  It only goes for $2,800 a month.
[03:05:16.700 --> 03:05:19.261]  Or how about life in a 90 square foot box?
[03:05:19.261 --> 03:05:24.142]  Woman's apartment takes cramped New York living to the extreme, but she's living in the West Village for just $7.75 a month.
[03:05:25.302 --> 03:05:26.603]  And here's one out of New York.
[03:05:26.603 --> 03:05:30.906]  What living in a dumpster for a year taught this professor about the things we don't need.
[03:05:30.906 --> 03:05:32.807]  All these articles have one thing in common.
[03:05:32.807 --> 03:05:36.529]  You are being trained and conditioned to accept less.
[03:05:36.529 --> 03:05:40.792]  We are living in a society that's going through monumental technological changes.
[03:05:40.792 --> 03:05:44.134]  We have the ability to create systems where everyone can prosper.
[03:05:44.134 --> 03:05:45.415]  But what's going on?
[03:05:45.415 --> 03:05:51.639]  The social engineers and social controllers of the world want us to expect less while paying more.
[03:05:51.639 --> 03:05:52.900]  It's all about social control.
[03:05:53.240 --> 03:05:55.260]  And this is the main reason why they won it.
[03:05:55.260 --> 03:05:58.741]  Rob Due reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:05:58.741 --> 03:06:05.643]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.tv, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[03:06:05.643 --> 03:06:08.543]  We've always offered five months free.
[03:06:08.543 --> 03:06:14.444]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[03:06:14.444 --> 03:06:16.265]  PrisonPlanet.tv began 15 years ago.
[03:06:17.865 --> 03:06:21.166]  It's grown into Infowars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[03:06:21.166 --> 03:06:30.129]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books, and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:30.129 --> 03:06:40.832]  You don't just get six months free when you sign up from Christmas through New Year's, you also get to share that membership with up to 20 people simultaneously using your username.
[03:06:41.112 --> 03:06:48.677]  You can also sign up for a trial month and only pay $5.95, and then 20 of you and your friends and family can watch PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:48.677 --> 03:06:50.759]  You get 20 memberships at half price.
[03:06:50.759 --> 03:06:52.860]  Be the Paul Revere in your community.
[03:06:52.860 --> 03:06:56.422]  That's 6 months free when you sign up for a year at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:58.647 --> 03:07:01.850]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[03:07:01.850 --> 03:07:04.192]  Deep Cleanse by Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:04.192 --> 03:07:11.218]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[03:07:11.218 --> 03:07:16.523]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanse is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[03:07:16.523 --> 03:07:25.531]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.
[03:07:25.951 --> 03:07:34.818]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[03:07:34.818 --> 03:07:41.903]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spite G-Rex herbal processing technique.
[03:07:41.903 --> 03:07:47.887]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs, backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.
[03:07:48.267 --> 03:07:53.195]  If you wish to find deep cleanse and experience the all-in-one cleansing visit Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:53.195 --> 03:07:55.137]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:08:08.189 --> 03:08:12.900]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:12.900 --> 03:08:17.952]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:27.910 --> 03:08:30.413]  We are live in the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:08:30.413 --> 03:08:34.316]  I'm your host Rob Doo, joining you in the big studio.
[03:08:34.316 --> 03:08:37.860]  Don't get to do the fourth hour too much out of this big studio, so this should be a lot of fun.
[03:08:37.860 --> 03:08:44.527]  Got my Wake Up America coffee cup and coffee right here, ready to go.
[03:08:44.527 --> 03:08:46.188]  Got a lot of news.
[03:08:46.188 --> 03:08:47.670]  If you were listening to the regular show,
[03:08:49.551 --> 03:08:57.637]  Then you heard my one minute rant on the tiny houses that they're basically trying to condition you to be a trendy slave.
[03:08:57.637 --> 03:09:05.382]  And if they can condition you to accept a small closet that you live in and pay $3,000 a month for it, then they can get you to do anything.
[03:09:05.382 --> 03:09:08.044]  They can get you to pay a ton of money for Obamacare.
[03:09:08.044 --> 03:09:12.648]  They can get you to accept the fact that we have to go to war with an enemy that we fund.
[03:09:13.488 --> 03:09:18.149]  And I'm going to play a report on that that we did earlier in December that pretty much has gone viral.
[03:09:18.149 --> 03:09:20.289]  It's got over 300,000 views.
[03:09:20.289 --> 03:09:23.770]  We just did a report akin to that over the weekend.
[03:09:23.770 --> 03:09:24.930]  I came in and shot one with Alex.
[03:09:24.930 --> 03:09:27.851]  Obama and ISIS caught eradicating Christianity.
[03:09:27.851 --> 03:09:29.751]  That's got 74,000 views.
[03:09:29.751 --> 03:09:34.972]  You know, came up here on a Saturday and Jones called me up and said, hey, we need to shoot a report.
[03:09:34.972 --> 03:09:36.833]  There's a ton of news going out.
[03:09:36.833 --> 03:09:38.393]  And in that report, he talks about
[03:09:39.213 --> 03:09:46.817]  How since Obama came into office, the attacks on Christians have increased in the Middle East.
[03:09:46.817 --> 03:09:48.018]  That's when it happened.
[03:09:48.018 --> 03:09:56.162]  It wasn't really going on when George Bush was there, although he did plenty to lay the pavement and groundwork and the battle plan for what we see today.
[03:09:56.162 --> 03:09:58.644]  This is a two-armed strategy here.
[03:09:58.644 --> 03:10:08.329]  You think the Republicans are good and going to help you out, and they smack you in the face with a bunch of wars and false flag terror, and then the Democrats come along and clean you up with the left hook.
[03:10:09.525 --> 03:10:12.386]  Well, let's go back to this Daily Mail article.
[03:10:12.386 --> 03:10:15.748]  60,000 New Yorkers sign up for tiny house development.
[03:10:15.748 --> 03:10:19.730]  265 square foot apartments with retractable beds attract huge waves of interest.
[03:10:19.730 --> 03:10:22.631]  But would you pay $3,000 a month for this?
[03:10:22.631 --> 03:10:24.612]  And it shows how trendy they look.
[03:10:24.612 --> 03:10:26.933]  It looks like it's filled with IKEA furniture.
[03:10:26.933 --> 03:10:27.974]  I'll go to some of the photos here.
[03:10:27.974 --> 03:10:30.075]  You guys can get them overhead.
[03:10:30.075 --> 03:10:34.077]  And that's Carmel Place, a new development with 55 properties.
[03:10:34.077 --> 03:10:36.998]  But what's interesting about this is that New York has now said there can be no
[03:10:38.559 --> 03:10:38.799]  We don't
[03:10:58.223 --> 03:11:08.129]  How millennials, they're the new, I guess, bellwether for everything, they don't like their parents' old furniture, the old solid furniture made of real wood.
[03:11:08.129 --> 03:11:12.652]  They want IKEA cheap furniture that falls apart after a few years.
[03:11:12.652 --> 03:11:20.016]  That's what they're into because they've been sold that dream, that that is the dream is to have your own apartment filled with, and I'm not blaming, you know, I own IKEA furniture.
[03:11:20.016 --> 03:11:23.098]  It's cheap and it's good and it's pretty solid overall.
[03:11:23.098 --> 03:11:24.979]  But if your parents are giving you a nice antique,
[03:11:26.434 --> 03:11:27.315]  You should take that.
[03:11:27.315 --> 03:11:29.116]  One, you don't have to pay for anything.
[03:11:29.116 --> 03:11:29.897]  You can refinish it.
[03:11:29.897 --> 03:11:32.899]  You can do a lot of things with these antiques, but they're not trained on it.
[03:11:32.899 --> 03:11:37.603]  They're trained to take this small living, living in where you can't turn, like submarines.
[03:11:37.603 --> 03:11:38.844]  Submarine living.
[03:11:38.844 --> 03:11:39.625]  Here's another one.
[03:11:39.625 --> 03:11:41.706]  Came out in February of this year.
[03:11:41.706 --> 03:11:43.168]  Life in a 90-square-foot box.
[03:11:43.168 --> 03:11:46.670]  Woman's apartment takes cramped New York living to an extreme.
[03:11:46.670 --> 03:11:51.955]  But she's in the West Village for just $7.75 a month, which is pretty much a steal in that area.
[03:11:51.955 --> 03:11:55.578]  But she's living in a 90-square-foot box, and you can see the picture of it right there.
[03:11:56.418 --> 03:11:58.080]  A new kind of micro apartment.
[03:11:58.080 --> 03:12:03.125]  New York fashion industry worker Mary Helen Rao calls this 90 square foot apartment in the West Village home.
[03:12:03.125 --> 03:12:07.489]  Okay, so it's all and they put these out all over the place.
[03:12:07.489 --> 03:12:08.229]  I've got articles.
[03:12:08.229 --> 03:12:10.131]  I just did a short, a short look.
[03:12:10.131 --> 03:12:10.612]  Here's another one.
[03:12:11.472 --> 03:12:15.775]  From August, inside NYC's impossibly small 100 square foot apartment.
[03:12:15.775 --> 03:12:19.658]  Well, the lady living in the West Village has got this guy beat by 10 square feet.
[03:12:19.658 --> 03:12:20.798]  She's going even smaller.
[03:12:20.798 --> 03:12:22.219]  She's even more trendy.
[03:12:22.219 --> 03:12:22.820]  Here's one.
[03:12:22.820 --> 03:12:24.061]  Tiny space, big price.
[03:12:24.061 --> 03:12:25.722]  Micro apartments in Portland.
[03:12:25.722 --> 03:12:28.083]  The units might be tiny, but that price isn't.
[03:12:28.083 --> 03:12:28.443]  That's right.
[03:12:28.443 --> 03:12:32.006]  They're training you to accept and pay more for less.
[03:12:33.809 --> 03:12:36.872]  And are we running into time to play that report?
[03:12:36.872 --> 03:12:37.973]  Am I running out of time?
[03:12:37.973 --> 03:12:39.794]  Okay, all right.
[03:12:39.794 --> 03:12:42.717]  I just want to show you two more articles and we're going to go to this ISIS report.
[03:12:42.717 --> 03:12:44.698]  Next big thing, micro apartments coming to Detroit.
[03:12:44.698 --> 03:12:52.425]  There are acres and acres of space in Detroit that you can, that they're bulldozing houses and they don't want anybody living there.
[03:12:52.425 --> 03:12:54.526]  They're rewilding these areas.
[03:12:54.526 --> 03:12:56.268]  So what's their solution?
[03:12:56.268 --> 03:12:59.811]  Make small apartments and make people, you know, cram them into them.
[03:12:59.811 --> 03:13:00.632]  And then Washington Post,
[03:13:01.272 --> 03:13:06.154]  What Living in a Dumpster for a Year taught this professor about the things that we don't need.
[03:13:06.154 --> 03:13:06.774]  That's right.
[03:13:06.774 --> 03:13:09.795]  And the people that are selling you this are multi-gazillionaires.
[03:13:09.795 --> 03:13:15.077]  They're billionaires that want you to live with nothing while they have everything and they get all the resources.
[03:13:15.077 --> 03:13:21.099]  And this was another article, I think this is out of the New Yorker, Micro Apartments Utopia or Dystopia.
[03:13:21.099 --> 03:13:25.240]  This is a pretty interesting read that talks about, you know, what are they really selling you?
[03:13:25.240 --> 03:13:28.341]  Are they selling you a turd in a sandwich?
[03:13:28.341 --> 03:13:29.502]  It's exactly what they're selling you.
[03:13:29.502 --> 03:13:30.342]  Let's go to this report now.
[03:13:31.263 --> 03:13:36.930]  This is about how, just kind of lays out the history of Obama and how he's running ISIS and quarterback and everything.
[03:13:36.930 --> 03:13:39.493]  He even, I even put his Freudian slip in there a couple times.
[03:13:39.493 --> 03:13:41.656]  It's got 323,000 views.
[03:13:41.656 --> 03:13:43.739]  I'll give you the title when we get back, but let's go to that report.
[03:13:44.642 --> 03:13:50.447]  Last night on my orders, America's armed forces began strikes against ISIL targets in Syria.
[03:13:50.447 --> 03:13:50.707]  U.S.
[03:13:50.707 --> 03:13:57.512]  counterterrorism officials asking why are ISIS fighters driving so many similar trucks and where are they getting them from?
[03:13:57.512 --> 03:14:03.397]  How do we know that the arms that are going to the Syrian rebels are not going to get into the hands of ISIS?
[03:14:03.957 --> 03:14:12.807]  Because if we had people who were there to funnel it to the right people, and I know these people, and I know who they are, and I know how to do it, and so do other people.
[03:14:12.807 --> 03:14:20.176]  You are basically saying that even in government at the time, you knew those groups were around, you saw this analysis, and you were arguing against it, but who wasn't listening?
[03:14:21.247 --> 03:14:23.468]  I think the administration.
[03:14:23.468 --> 03:14:29.490]  In an interview with the New Yorker magazine, he compares groups linked to Al-Qaeda to an amateur basketball team.
[03:14:29.490 --> 03:14:37.532]  Intelligence officials in Pakistan say a local commander from the terrorist network Islamic State has admitted receiving funds transferred via the US.
[03:14:37.532 --> 03:14:39.373]  He made the confession while being interrogated.
[03:14:39.893 --> 03:14:47.157]  Today we learned that the same group may now be in possession of a deadly cache of American-made firepower, Stinger missiles.
[03:14:47.157 --> 03:14:48.897]  I didn't think it was a willful decision.
[03:14:48.897 --> 03:14:52.419]  A willful decision to go support an insurgency that had Salafists, Al-Qaeda, and Muslim Brotherhood.
[03:14:52.419 --> 03:15:00.283]  Well, a willful decision to do what they're doing, which you have to really ask the President, what is it that he actually is doing?
[03:15:01.164 --> 03:15:08.990]  As I've said before, this aspect of our strategy was moving too slowly, but the fall of Ramadi has galvanized the Iraqi government.
[03:15:08.990 --> 03:15:17.076]  So with the additional steps I ordered last month, we're speeding up training of ISIL forces, including volunteers from Sunni tribes in Anbar province.
[03:15:17.256 --> 03:15:17.676]  Now U.S.
[03:15:17.676 --> 03:15:22.878]  military aircraft have dropped ammunition in areas held by ISIL terror group in Iraq.
[03:15:22.878 --> 03:15:31.021]  According to volunteer forces who are fighting the terrorists, American helicopters dropped boxes of weapons in Yathrib and Balad districts in the Salahuddin province.
[03:15:31.021 --> 03:15:44.325]  We now hear that President Obama will ask Congress for 5.3 billion dollars to equip and train Iraqi soldiers and quote-unquote moderate Syrian rebels to fight the Islamic State militants.
[03:15:44.605 --> 03:15:46.587]  Do you know that he made the Air Force drop leaflets?
[03:15:59.179 --> 03:16:03.022]  Telling the ISIS truck drivers to get out that bombs were gonna fall.
[03:16:03.022 --> 03:16:04.123]  Did you know that?
[03:16:04.123 --> 03:16:05.905]  Does anyone know that he did that?
[03:16:05.905 --> 03:16:09.067]  This is gonna make people think twice about this guy.
[03:16:09.067 --> 03:16:12.930]  This is not as clear as it may be of he's just a pacifist or a liberal.
[03:16:12.930 --> 03:16:15.032]  There's something more here, Donald.
[03:16:15.032 --> 03:16:17.114]  And it's been more than a year now.
[03:16:17.114 --> 03:16:22.939]  ISIS's capabilities seem to be expanding.
[03:16:22.939 --> 03:16:27.703]  Were you aware that they had the capability of pulling off the kind of attack that they did in Paris?
[03:16:28.896 --> 03:16:34.581]  Are you concerned and do you think they have that same capability to strike in the United States?
[03:16:34.581 --> 03:16:46.590]  The unclassified reports have estimated that in just the first 12 months of renewed ISIS operations in Syria and Iraq, they've recruited more than 22,000 foreign fighters.
[03:16:46.590 --> 03:16:49.773]  At least 4,000 are Westerners.
[03:16:49.773 --> 03:16:53.916]  So those are Americans, Brits, French citizens, German citizens.
[03:16:54.056 --> 03:16:56.658]  It was very disturbing to pull this from the U.M.
[03:16:56.658 --> 03:17:11.089]  website in September that says of the 381,412 arrivals that came across the Mediterranean Sea just this year, up to September, that 15% were children, 13% were women, and 72% were men.
[03:17:17.674 --> 03:17:24.842]  Such a backlash against Syrian refugees coming to the United States after the word that some of these attackers may have passed through Syria.
[03:17:24.842 --> 03:17:27.765]  31 governors now say they don't want them living in their states.
[03:17:27.765 --> 03:17:31.029]  Many presidential candidates calling for a ban or religious test.
[03:17:31.029 --> 03:17:33.512]  Congress moving for a moratorium on new refugees.
[03:17:33.852 --> 03:17:40.594]  They point out there's an extensive vetting process that includes the intelligence community, the departments of state and homeland security.
[03:17:40.594 --> 03:17:51.518]  In fact, George... The concerns in Syria is that we don't have the systems in place on the ground to collect the information to vet.
[03:17:51.518 --> 03:17:53.159]  That would be the concern.
[03:17:53.159 --> 03:17:59.381]  Yes, I think that's the challenge we're all talking about, is that we can only query against that which we have collected.
[03:18:00.101 --> 03:18:06.470]  You can't account for what you don't know, and that goes to the intelligence deficit that I think is embedded in your question.
[03:18:06.470 --> 03:18:09.415]  But apparently they're scared of widows and orphans.
[03:18:10.575 --> 03:18:15.257]  Coming into the United States of America as part of our tradition of compassion.
[03:18:15.257 --> 03:18:17.898]  It's a terror threat unlike any Europe or the U.S.
[03:18:17.898 --> 03:18:18.899]  has seen before.
[03:18:18.899 --> 03:18:21.580]  It's the ultimate stealth weapon for ISIS.
[03:18:21.580 --> 03:18:26.142]  A female suicide bomber is like a stealth precision weapon.
[03:18:26.142 --> 03:18:29.383]  Stealth precision weapon, Brian, and this is a major change in strategy.
[03:18:29.383 --> 03:18:35.046]  Thanks to our military and counterterrorism professionals, America is safer.
[03:18:35.987 --> 03:18:43.131]  We may have somebody who comes to us and is simply not on our radar for any discernible reason.
[03:18:43.131 --> 03:18:50.635]  And there may also be the possibility that somebody decides to do something bad after they've been admitted through the process.
[03:18:50.635 --> 03:19:04.262]  We do not close our hearts to these victims of such violence and somehow start equating
[03:19:05.231 --> 03:19:08.034]  The issue of refugees with the issue of terrorism.
[03:19:08.034 --> 03:19:16.182]  They're reaching out to various countries that have been fighting ISIS in Syria and Iraq, urging followers to attack in their home country.
[03:19:16.182 --> 03:19:20.647]  The FBI is still gathering the facts about what happened in San Bernardino, but here's what we know.
[03:19:22.071 --> 03:19:27.476]  The victims were brutally murdered and injured by one of their co-workers and his wife.
[03:19:27.476 --> 03:19:35.784]  So far we have no evidence that the killers were directed by a terrorist organization overseas or that they were part of a broader conspiracy here at home.
[03:19:35.784 --> 03:19:44.532]  Because we have the clearest indication yet that that shooting rampaged two days ago in San Bernardino, California was an act of terror inspired by ISIS.
[03:19:45.312 --> 03:19:46.413]  What a surprise, though.
[03:19:46.413 --> 03:19:47.094]  What a surprise.
[03:19:47.094 --> 03:19:50.797]  It's been seven years since he's been in office, and yet all he does is attack Christians.
[03:19:50.797 --> 03:19:52.098]  Obama caught running ISIS.
[03:19:52.098 --> 03:19:53.118]  Get that out to everybody you know.
[03:19:53.118 --> 03:19:59.683]  Coming up, I'm going to tell you ways that you can get out of Obamacare instead of paying those high costs, and a man who sued the TSA twice, coming up.
[03:19:59.683 --> 03:20:03.126]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?

[03:23:53.744 --> 03:23:57.165]  From all of us here at SupernaturalSilver.com.
[03:24:13.595 --> 03:24:16.956]  Rob Dew here for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:16.956 --> 03:24:18.617]  Call your local radio station.
[03:24:18.617 --> 03:24:19.897]  Ask them if they're carrying the fourth hour.
[03:24:19.897 --> 03:24:22.979]  It's a whole other hour of the show that they could be getting.
[03:24:22.979 --> 03:24:24.259]  And it's on TV as well.
[03:24:24.259 --> 03:24:26.600]  You can go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:24:26.600 --> 03:24:27.220]  Watch the whole thing.
[03:24:27.220 --> 03:24:28.841]  Look at the articles that we're showing you.
[03:24:28.841 --> 03:24:35.384]  The last piece we just played for the second part of that segment was how Obama was caught running ISIS.
[03:24:36.204 --> 03:24:51.237]  Video's got 323,000 views right now, put that out in December, and it just shows you the power of our listeners and our fans out there and fans of freedom that are sick and tired of the wool being pulled over everyone's eyes and they're just trying to show people what's going on.
[03:24:51.237 --> 03:24:56.241]  I mean, he admits it, that it's a Freudian slip, obviously, but he admits that they're training ISIS.
[03:24:56.241 --> 03:24:58.082]  I just think it's so ridiculous.
[03:24:58.082 --> 03:25:02.086]  So, as I said as we were going to break, I was going to talk about three ways to get out of Obamacare.
[03:25:03.348 --> 03:25:10.409]  And I'm actually in one of these, and I've used it for a couple years now, so I can attest that it does work for me.
[03:25:10.409 --> 03:25:13.930]  But here's the article out of Fox Business.
[03:25:13.930 --> 03:25:18.011]  Obamacare premiums will increase in 2016, but by how much?
[03:25:18.011 --> 03:25:22.572]  Well, they say the annual deductibles for the silver plan are going to increase 17%.
[03:25:22.572 --> 03:25:25.973]  So you're going to have the deductible from $2,800 going to $4,400.
[03:25:28.803 --> 03:25:33.184]  And that's what you have to pay before they start paying any of those out-of-pocket costs.
[03:25:33.184 --> 03:25:37.365]  And for the Family Silver Plan, it's going to go from $5,800 to $6,800, so an extra $1,000.
[03:25:37.365 --> 03:25:46.346]  And the average term of the deductible skyrocketed in some states, including Washington, which saw a 76% increase, or roughly $3,500 a year.
[03:25:46.346 --> 03:25:47.627]  Mississippi, 42%.
[03:25:47.627 --> 03:25:49.107]  South Carolina, 37%.
[03:25:49.107 --> 03:25:52.428]  Now insurance is only supposed to be in case you need it.
[03:25:52.428 --> 03:25:53.168]  It's not supposed to be
[03:25:54.489 --> 03:26:04.158]  You're paying all this money to these big executives of these insurance companies who help write the Obamacare plan so they can go on luxury vacations while you're scrambling to pay your bills each month.
[03:26:04.158 --> 03:26:11.926]  But just so you have insurance, and this is what people don't understand, you're paying that premium every month, $500, $600, $700, some people $1,200 a month.
[03:26:15.572 --> 03:26:19.595]  Then, the insurance doesn't kick in and start paying until after you get to the deductible.
[03:26:19.595 --> 03:26:21.156]  That's another little add-on they put on.
[03:26:21.156 --> 03:26:22.758]  So that your deductible may be $5,000.
[03:26:22.758 --> 03:26:29.723]  So in addition to paying all this money each month, they're not gonna touch your bill until it gets over a certain amount.
[03:26:29.723 --> 03:26:31.304]  Some plans it's $2,500.
[03:26:31.304 --> 03:26:35.367]  Some plans, you have to pay a lot for a plan that's $500 a month.
[03:26:35.367 --> 03:26:39.571]  Now, I'm gonna go over three groups out there.
[03:26:39.571 --> 03:26:41.892]  They're called health sharing groups.
[03:26:41.892 --> 03:26:44.795]  And basically what they do is, there's not a big infrastructure.
[03:26:45.563 --> 03:26:49.987]  You join the group, you pay your monthly fee, and you pay it directly to people.
[03:26:49.987 --> 03:26:51.027]  Whatever they determine out.
[03:26:51.027 --> 03:26:54.850]  And that comes, and it's a lot less than what you're going to pay for Obamacare.
[03:26:54.850 --> 03:26:55.991]  First one's Liberty HealthShare.
[03:26:55.991 --> 03:27:01.576]  We actually had the head of Liberty HealthShare on about a year ago, maybe a year and a half ago, talking about this.
[03:27:01.576 --> 03:27:04.378]  And the costs of healthcare are stacked against you.
[03:27:04.378 --> 03:27:06.299]  So this is their bold alternative.
[03:27:06.299 --> 03:27:07.380]  And basically it's...
[03:27:08.641 --> 03:27:17.446]  You gotta put on your big boy pants, you gotta do a little bit of work, but let me tell you, it's worth it in the end because you really don't need insurance unless you get hurt.
[03:27:17.446 --> 03:27:19.607]  And the chances are you're not gonna get hurt.
[03:27:19.607 --> 03:27:25.171]  Chances are you really don't need all this insurance that they're telling you you have to have.
[03:27:25.171 --> 03:27:25.811]  So this is one way.
[03:27:25.811 --> 03:27:27.012]  Samaritan is another one.
[03:27:27.012 --> 03:27:27.992]  Samaritan Ministries.
[03:27:27.992 --> 03:27:31.714]  I'm actually a member, my whole family is a member of Samaritan Ministries.
[03:27:31.714 --> 03:27:36.637]  We pay, I think it's like $4.03 a month for the whole family.
[03:27:36.637 --> 03:27:37.798]  And what we have to cover,
[03:27:38.624 --> 03:27:39.865]  Which you could call a deductible.
[03:27:39.865 --> 03:27:41.767]  They don't call it a deductible.
[03:27:41.767 --> 03:27:46.130]  But after $300, it kicks in.
[03:27:46.130 --> 03:27:48.872]  So, do you like $2,500 deductible?
[03:27:48.872 --> 03:27:51.874]  Or $300 but we're not going to call it a deductible.
[03:27:51.874 --> 03:27:53.976]  They're just not going to cover the first $300 of it.
[03:27:53.976 --> 03:27:57.979]  But after that, we just had our fourth child.
[03:27:57.979 --> 03:28:00.401]  Lovely little girl.
[03:28:00.401 --> 03:28:01.122]  All of it was covered.
[03:28:03.327 --> 03:28:05.088]  By the Health Sharing Ministry.
[03:28:05.088 --> 03:28:06.910]  Thank you, Samaritan.
[03:28:06.910 --> 03:28:11.353]  And then there's Medishare, M-E-D-I-S-H-A-R-E.
[03:28:11.353 --> 03:28:18.797]  A lot of these, the only reason these three are, you can opt out of Obamacare is because they came in in the 90s, since 1993.
[03:28:18.797 --> 03:28:23.621]  All these have been around that long, so they were able to opt out of the Obamacare
[03:28:24.441 --> 03:28:24.861]  I don't know.
[03:28:46.150 --> 03:28:51.894]  Um, salaries are not increasing as much unless you're working for the government and those seem to go up astronomically.
[03:28:51.894 --> 03:28:54.676]  Uh, here's an article Don Salazar just put out.
[03:28:54.676 --> 03:28:58.658]  David Spade, Obama should have more dignity than to appear on reality TV.
[03:28:58.658 --> 03:29:03.822]  I think that Michelle Obama's son or Michelle Obama's on Ellen more than I am, says Joe Dirtstar.
[03:29:03.822 --> 03:29:11.147]  And he was confronted by TMZ after he put this, he put out a tweet and then he erased it, probably got some backlash.
[03:29:11.147 --> 03:29:13.408]  You can't talk about Obama.
[03:29:13.408 --> 03:29:15.550]  So here's what he had to say when confronted by TMZ.
[03:29:17.796 --> 03:29:20.957]  You criticized Obama for going on the Bear Grylls, running wild shows.
[03:29:20.957 --> 03:29:28.020]  I criticized Obama because I thought, you know, a president should have a little more dignity.
[03:29:28.020 --> 03:29:34.363]  I mean, I realized that Woodrow Wilson went on Dancing with the Stars once, but what presidents do in reality shows?
[03:29:34.363 --> 03:29:36.264]  It just sounds weird to me, right?
[03:29:36.264 --> 03:29:38.584]  I mean, it's just too much, so.
[03:29:38.584 --> 03:29:42.306]  I think that, you know, Michelle Obama is not as important as I am.
[03:29:42.506 --> 03:29:43.927]  Yeah, it's very weird.
[03:29:43.927 --> 03:29:47.250]  It's very weird that we have our president appearing on reality TV shows.
[03:29:47.250 --> 03:29:49.451]  Hey, when we get back, we're gonna have the man who sued the TSA twice now.
[03:29:49.451 --> 03:29:50.152]  Stay tuned.
[03:29:59.105 --> 03:30:00.566]  Are you looking for affordable housing?
[03:30:00.566 --> 03:30:02.747]  Well, check out these headlines.
[03:30:02.747 --> 03:30:05.308]  60,000 New Yorkers sign up for tiny house development.
[03:30:05.308 --> 03:30:07.570]  265 square foot apartments.
[03:30:07.570 --> 03:30:10.271]  But would you pay $3,000 a month for this?
[03:30:10.271 --> 03:30:14.893]  Next, inside NYC's impossibly small 100 square foot apartment.
[03:30:14.893 --> 03:30:16.834]  It only goes for $2,800 a month.
[03:30:16.834 --> 03:30:19.396]  Or how about life in a 90 square foot box?
[03:30:19.396 --> 03:30:24.278]  Woman's apartment takes cramped New York living to the extreme, but she's living in the West Village for just $7.75 a month.
[03:30:25.439 --> 03:30:26.740]  And here's one out of New York.
[03:30:26.740 --> 03:30:31.041]  What living in a dumpster for a year taught this professor about the things we don't need.
[03:30:31.041 --> 03:30:32.942]  All these articles have one thing in common.
[03:30:32.942 --> 03:30:36.664]  You are being trained and conditioned to accept less.
[03:30:36.664 --> 03:30:40.926]  We are living in a society that's going through monumental technological changes.
[03:30:40.926 --> 03:30:44.287]  We have the ability to create systems where everyone can prosper.
[03:30:44.287 --> 03:30:45.528]  But what's going on?
[03:30:45.528 --> 03:30:51.750]  The social engineers and social controllers of the world want us to expect less while paying more.
[03:30:51.750 --> 03:30:53.011]  It's all about social control.
[03:30:53.371 --> 03:30:55.393]  And this is the main reason why they won it.
[03:30:55.393 --> 03:30:58.936]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:30:58.936 --> 03:31:06.162]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[03:33:11.923 --> 03:33:20.408]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:33:20.408 --> 03:33:24.770]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:24.770 --> 03:33:28.952]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:33:28.952 --> 03:33:30.533]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:34.508 --> 03:33:46.555]  Alright, I'm your host Rob Dew, this is the fourth hour, at the bottom of the hour, about a half an hour left, and our next guest coming up, John Corbett, has sued the DSA not once, but twice.
[03:33:46.555 --> 03:33:52.559]  The first time he just kind of sat around in limbo and got rejected by the Supreme Court, because they don't want to talk about this security theater.
[03:33:52.559 --> 03:33:54.380]  But where it all goes back to, where does it all go back to?
[03:33:54.380 --> 03:33:58.863]  Well, if you have seen Police State 4 The Rise of FEMA, you know where it all starts.
[03:33:59.915 --> 03:34:01.456]  The birth of the TSA.
[03:34:01.456 --> 03:34:06.660]  Right there, Chapter 8, you can go to and watch all about the underwear bomber.
[03:34:06.660 --> 03:34:11.023]  And how, within days, we came out talking about how it was a false flag government operation.
[03:34:11.023 --> 03:34:11.623]  Why?
[03:34:11.623 --> 03:34:13.785]  Not because we just decided to say that.
[03:34:13.785 --> 03:34:16.387]  Well, no, just because there was a witness.
[03:34:16.387 --> 03:34:17.447]  There was a witness there saying,
[03:34:18.948 --> 03:34:21.829]  I saw a well-dressed man get this bomber onto the plane.
[03:34:21.829 --> 03:34:23.890]  His name was Kurt Haskell and he's an attorney.
[03:34:23.890 --> 03:34:26.532]  Not a guy to run around and just make up stories like that.
[03:34:26.532 --> 03:34:28.012]  He was coming back from safari with his wife.
[03:34:28.012 --> 03:34:29.033]  Very successful attorney.
[03:34:29.033 --> 03:34:33.075]  Both him and his wife were attorneys at the time living in the Detroit area.
[03:34:33.075 --> 03:34:37.637]  And we put out several interviews with Kurt Haskell.
[03:34:37.637 --> 03:34:41.919]  There's one that I actually went to Detroit and interviewed him on camera, in person.
[03:34:42.856 --> 03:34:44.777]  And got him to talk about the whole story.
[03:34:44.777 --> 03:34:51.879]  Everything from seeing the well-dressed man get him onto the plane, to seeing the FBI tackle the guy and bring him off the plane.
[03:34:51.879 --> 03:34:54.660]  But they kept everybody on the plane for 20 minutes.
[03:34:54.660 --> 03:34:57.701]  And then how they didn't check anybody else's bags.
[03:34:57.701 --> 03:35:01.602]  They just let everybody sit around with the bags in a closed room.
[03:35:01.602 --> 03:35:03.743]  And then he kept wanting to talk about this sharp-dressed man.
[03:35:03.743 --> 03:35:05.003]  Nobody wanted to talk to him about it.
[03:35:05.003 --> 03:35:06.323]  Nobody wanted to say anything about it.
[03:35:06.323 --> 03:35:09.544]  Nobody cared because they knew that was a government operation.
[03:35:09.544 --> 03:35:11.225]  So there's no reason to even go there.
[03:35:12.611 --> 03:35:22.321]  We've played you the clips of, I think his name is Patrick Kennedy, talking about how they had an operation going on and they didn't want to disclose that they were watching somebody, so they let him go through.
[03:35:22.321 --> 03:35:23.463]  They let the underwear bomber go through.
[03:35:23.463 --> 03:35:24.243]  They let it happen.
[03:35:24.243 --> 03:35:25.164]  They let it happen.
[03:35:25.164 --> 03:35:26.346]  Admitted from a government official.
[03:35:27.617 --> 03:35:35.163]  So, in response to this, John Corbett decides to bypass and show how easily you could fake these TSA body scanners.
[03:35:35.163 --> 03:35:41.929]  But before that, right after the underwear bomber happened, you had Michael Chertoff, who was head of Homeland Security for a while.
[03:35:41.929 --> 03:35:47.354]  He's running around after this happened saying, we gotta get body scanners, we gotta get body scanners, that's the only way we can stop an underwear bomb.
[03:35:47.814 --> 03:35:51.956]  Or a boob bomb or a pregnancy bomb is with body scanners.
[03:35:51.956 --> 03:36:04.942]  Oh, it turns out he represents Rampage Scan and made hundreds of millions of dollars off that technology being put into airports all over the country, making you and your kids and your wife go through the naked body scanner.
[03:36:06.127 --> 03:36:08.988]  And we showed you that it shows a naked image of your body.
[03:36:08.988 --> 03:36:20.273]  We showed you that there's DNA that could be reprogrammed with those waves, the microwaves, the little microwaves that come out of the machine.
[03:36:20.273 --> 03:36:24.975]  So he filed a lawsuit, this recent one, just on December 24th.
[03:36:24.975 --> 03:36:26.376]  Paul Joseph Watson wrote about it.
[03:36:26.376 --> 03:36:31.298]  TSA hit with lawsuit after nixing body scanner opt-out.
[03:36:31.298 --> 03:36:32.879]  And our guest is on the line right now.
[03:36:32.879 --> 03:36:33.859]  John, how are you doing?
[03:36:36.755 --> 03:36:38.056]  Hey Rob, good to be with you again.
[03:36:38.056 --> 03:36:38.536]  Yeah.
[03:36:38.536 --> 03:36:43.019]  So, Professional Troublemaker, is that .com or .org?
[03:36:43.019 --> 03:36:45.000]  Professional-troublemaker.com.
[03:36:45.000 --> 03:36:46.941]  Professional-troublemaker.com.
[03:36:46.941 --> 03:36:48.902]  That is definitely what you are.
[03:36:48.902 --> 03:37:03.170]  Back in 2012, you put out the video showing you sewing in a little side pocket in a garment and going through the TSA body scanner with a little metal, it looked like a makeup case, but that could be the size of a bomb or a weapon or anything.
[03:37:03.996 --> 03:37:08.680]  And you showed that it could be done, and then you sued the TSA, and then they hit you with a gag order.
[03:37:08.680 --> 03:37:18.708]  Why don't you take everybody through the timeline of this, since you started working on this odyssey of going against a useless government agency.
[03:37:20.413 --> 03:37:22.734]  Sure, it's been a long time, over five years now.
[03:37:22.734 --> 03:37:25.034]  Basically, the body scanners went into primary screening.
[03:37:25.034 --> 03:37:32.416]  That is, they were the front devices in airports across the country in October of 2010.
[03:37:32.416 --> 03:37:38.138]  So since then, I filed my lawsuit against the scanners in November 2010.
[03:37:38.138 --> 03:37:45.680]  I've gone through incredible litigation just to figure out what the right court to hear it is and what the rules around hearing that case will be and so forth.
[03:37:51.144 --> 03:37:53.926]  About two to three years just to figure that part out.
[03:37:53.926 --> 03:37:57.428]  And then another year for them to say that they actually didn't want to hear it at all.
[03:37:57.428 --> 03:37:57.808]  Right.
[03:37:57.808 --> 03:37:58.889]  Yeah, they finally threw it out.
[03:37:58.889 --> 03:38:00.370]  They hit you with a gag order.
[03:38:00.370 --> 03:38:03.571]  They put out a redacted... I'm looking for that document right now.
[03:38:03.571 --> 03:38:06.073]  They put out... Here it is.
[03:38:06.073 --> 03:38:09.775]  And it's from the article by Don Salazar.
[03:38:09.775 --> 03:38:12.836]  DOJ censors blogger for documents they released.
[03:38:12.836 --> 03:38:13.937]  They put out these documents.
[03:38:13.937 --> 03:38:15.638]  I'm going to give you guys a larger scan right here.
[03:38:15.638 --> 03:38:17.579]  Y'all can see that.
[03:38:17.579 --> 03:38:18.980]  And what they redact out
[03:38:20.467 --> 03:38:31.572]  And even on the global scale, including Middle Eastern countries with extreme civil unrest and a high prevalence of improvised explosive devices in use on the ground, explosives on airplanes are extremely rare.
[03:38:31.572 --> 03:38:40.335]  For example, the TSA analyzed hijackings in 2007 and found seven hijacking incidents across the globe, but none of them involved actual explosive devices.
[03:38:40.335 --> 03:38:43.597]  So, they say they're extremely rare in the document.
[03:38:43.597 --> 03:38:44.357]  There it is right there.
[03:38:44.357 --> 03:38:46.258]  But they censored you.
[03:38:46.258 --> 03:38:47.698]  They said you couldn't talk about that.
[03:38:47.698 --> 03:38:48.839]  They put a gag order on you.
[03:38:49.619 --> 03:39:03.664]  Yeah, unfortunately I'm actually still under that gag order so I can't even comment on that other than to say I'm glad that you guys found it and are sharing it with the people, but as far as its contents, I unfortunately am prohibited by law from commenting on it.
[03:39:03.664 --> 03:39:08.166]  That's our loving country for you, right there, telling you you can't talk about information they put out.
[03:39:08.166 --> 03:39:10.227]  That's why they don't want to show you the 28 pages of that 9-11 report.
[03:39:11.767 --> 03:39:12.328]  Well, go on.
[03:39:12.328 --> 03:39:17.131]  So, now you've filed this new lawsuit in response to what the TSA has done.
[03:39:17.131 --> 03:39:22.755]  The TSA put out a report saying they're not going to allow people to opt out of the body scanners anymore.
[03:39:22.755 --> 03:39:25.878]  So, talk about that, why you've hit them with a new lawsuit.
[03:39:25.878 --> 03:39:26.398]  That's right.
[03:39:26.398 --> 03:39:31.322]  So, since 2010, when these lawsuits started coming in, I wasn't the only one.
[03:39:31.322 --> 03:39:37.767]  There's about half a dozen attorneys and law students and so forth across the country that filed suits.
[03:39:37.767 --> 03:39:40.809]  In each of the cases, the Department of Justice has said, one of the reasons why
[03:39:41.525 --> 03:39:49.047]  These body scanners should be considered constitutional is that they're optional because you can opt for a pat-down.
[03:39:49.047 --> 03:39:50.487]  A pat-down isn't really a great option.
[03:39:50.487 --> 03:39:54.488]  They're basically saying, choose death by this way or this way or so forth.
[03:39:54.488 --> 03:39:55.609]  But they said it was optional.
[03:39:55.609 --> 03:40:06.971]  And now that all these lawsuits have been finally thrown out, the TSA is now going back on what they're saying and saying, nope, now that they're not optional, at any time we can actually force you to go through these scanners.
[03:40:06.971 --> 03:40:09.072]  So that's why I filed suit about a week ago.
[03:40:10.342 --> 03:40:12.223]  And where is your suit right now?
[03:40:12.223 --> 03:40:15.564]  What is the progress of it?
[03:40:15.564 --> 03:40:17.445]  So the suit is just at the beginning part.
[03:40:17.445 --> 03:40:23.967]  The TSA has a period of time to respond to it, probably a few weeks, and they can ask for a few more weeks if they need to.
[03:40:23.967 --> 03:40:36.232]  The lawsuit asked for a preliminary injunction, so that'll be the first thing that's heard to ask the court to say, you know, while we're thinking about this case, the TSA should hold on this new order and continue screening the way it was before.
[03:40:37.673 --> 03:40:46.985]  There's at least one other case that also has a motion for, in that case, a temporary restraining order, which will be heard in probably this week.
[03:40:48.459 --> 03:40:52.982]  So, there's a few fronts that the TSA is being challenged on about this.
[03:40:52.982 --> 03:41:02.347]  The other interesting thing is that this new rule was just arbitrarily made up by the TSA without what we call notice and comment rulemaking.
[03:41:02.347 --> 03:41:16.455]  So, these federal agencies that are about to make a federal regulation or rule or issue an order that affects the public are required by the Administrative Procedures Act to give notice in this document they call the Federal Register, which is a collection of
[03:41:17.246 --> 03:41:21.779]  All these notices and they're supposed to ask or listen to comments from the public.
[03:41:23.732 --> 03:41:30.237]  When the TSA implemented the body scanners in 2010, they didn't do so, and they were ordered by a court in D.C.
[03:41:30.237 --> 03:41:31.178]  to actually do so.
[03:41:31.178 --> 03:41:35.121]  So they actually asked for comments in 2013, but still have not responded to them.
[03:41:35.121 --> 03:41:41.226]  But notwithstanding the original body scanner decision in 2010, they've now put out a new decision making them mandatory.
[03:41:41.226 --> 03:41:44.589]  They've again failed to do notice and comment rulemaking.
[03:41:44.589 --> 03:41:48.992]  So the TSA is basically saying we can do what we want, when we want, and we don't think the courts are going to stop us.
[03:41:48.992 --> 03:41:51.855]  So that's what we're hoping is that
[03:41:53.416 --> 03:41:56.638]  Yeah, your sky's breaking up.
[03:41:56.638 --> 03:42:01.160]  There's a couple rules and we're going to ask you to follow those.
[03:42:01.160 --> 03:42:01.961]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:42:01.961 --> 03:42:04.042]  This is a total lawlessness of our government.
[03:42:04.042 --> 03:42:08.205]  They make up these rules and regulations basically out of fairy tales.
[03:42:08.205 --> 03:42:09.045]  We showed it.
[03:42:09.045 --> 03:42:11.607]  Police State for the Rise of FEMA, Chapter 8.
[03:42:11.607 --> 03:42:13.628]  You can go to it and watch all about the underwear bomber.
[03:42:14.108 --> 03:42:36.467]  All about how it was a total lie, it was an operation, they admitted it was an operation, we've proved it time and time again, yet they keep up with these lies, they keep talking about them, they keep creating new versions of them, and now they create these laws where you can't opt out of the body scanners that they put in, and they just, they don't even ask for public comment, they just say, that's it, you don't have a say in what we do to you.
[03:42:36.467 --> 03:42:42.092]  And if they can get through this, John talk about this, if they can do this, if they can force you into a machine,
[03:42:43.433 --> 03:42:47.858]  And say, without even public comment, what can they do to us after that?
[03:42:47.858 --> 03:42:49.621]  What else can they do to us, John?
[03:42:49.621 --> 03:42:55.568]  You know, if the courts won't accept a challenge on this one, on making these machines mandatory...
[03:42:56.460 --> 03:42:59.741]  It really is a question of how far can they go?
[03:42:59.741 --> 03:43:01.122]  And what are the boundaries?
[03:43:01.122 --> 03:43:08.604]  And if they can get away with this essentially virtual strip search, can they do a physical strip search?
[03:43:08.604 --> 03:43:10.044]  Can they ask you to bend over?
[03:43:10.044 --> 03:43:12.125]  I don't know where that line is.
[03:43:12.125 --> 03:43:17.747]  We're asking the course to finally say, all right, you found the line, you've hit it, go back a few steps.
[03:43:19.028 --> 03:43:20.589]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:43:20.589 --> 03:43:25.614]  I've probably made, I don't know, 15, 20 flights since the body scanners have gone in place.
[03:43:25.614 --> 03:43:27.275]  Never gone through a body scanner.
[03:43:27.275 --> 03:43:32.340]  Always had to opt out and go for the pat-down, which is just as humiliating.
[03:43:32.340 --> 03:43:34.362]  I think it's more humiliating than the pat-down.
[03:43:34.362 --> 03:43:35.843]  I think they did that on purpose.
[03:43:35.843 --> 03:43:40.587]  They create this invasive process where, you know, they basically touch every part of your body.
[03:43:41.428 --> 03:43:45.731]  Through the clothes and even pull open your waistband and look inside.
[03:43:45.731 --> 03:43:47.392]  I mean, it's pretty demeaning.
[03:43:47.392 --> 03:43:51.695]  And the guys that line up for that are, you know, seem to be like guys who would like to do stuff like that.
[03:43:51.695 --> 03:43:55.537]  Not, although a couple of times I had guys like, man, I'm so sorry.
[03:43:55.537 --> 03:43:56.197]  I got to do this.
[03:43:56.197 --> 03:43:56.658]  I got to do it.
[03:43:56.658 --> 03:43:58.519]  I got my manager watching me over there.
[03:43:58.519 --> 03:44:01.421]  I got to do the full court press is what he called it.
[03:44:01.421 --> 03:44:08.005]  And of course, you laugh to try and mask the uncomfortableness of the situation.
[03:44:09.065 --> 03:44:22.493]  But it just shows you what kind of demons are running the TSA that they could just... And this is all created to set up, now they've got the TSA in train stations, they're bringing them out to concerts, they're bringing them to sporting events.
[03:44:22.493 --> 03:44:23.894]  When's it going to stop?
[03:44:23.894 --> 03:44:29.218]  I mean, are they going to have body scanner machines set up at every giant public gathering that we all have to walk through?
[03:44:29.218 --> 03:44:30.498]  And you're right.
[03:44:30.498 --> 03:44:34.361]  They're trying to find out where they can go, how far they can take it.
[03:44:35.504 --> 03:44:48.973]  And what other media, John, what other media have you been contacted, has contacted you about this case?
[03:44:48.973 --> 03:44:50.814]  Yeah, it sounds like his Skype.
[03:44:50.814 --> 03:44:55.798]  You know what, let's try to go on the phone maybe and keep him on video Skype and just go to phone on there.
[03:44:57.571 --> 03:44:58.914]  Let's just look at this.
[03:44:58.914 --> 03:45:00.999]  Go back to 2010.
[03:45:00.999 --> 03:45:01.961]  Fear pays.
[03:45:01.961 --> 03:45:06.010]  Chertoff ex-security officials slammed for cashing in on government experience.
[03:45:07.611 --> 03:45:22.083]  After last month's plot to send bombs to Yemen to the United States aboard a cargo plane, former Homeland Security Chief Michael Chertoff's whiskerless visage was ubiquitous on cable news, solemnly warning the nation needed stronger security procedures.
[03:45:22.083 --> 03:45:24.945]  And of course he was talking about body scanners the whole time.
[03:45:24.945 --> 03:45:32.631]  In the past year and a half, this is back in 2010, $118 million in stimulus funds have been used to buy technology from RapaScan.
[03:45:32.631 --> 03:45:34.833]  But all that money hasn't produced many jobs.
[03:45:35.708 --> 03:45:41.953]  Of course, that's all Huffington Post is caring about, if their government's using this money to create jobs.
[03:45:41.953 --> 03:45:55.323]  The ARRA Act, it was the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, accounts for only 84 positions, according to a Huffington Post analyst of government data, meaning that roughly $1.4 million was spent to create each job.
[03:45:55.323 --> 03:45:56.765]  Yeah, this is a giant payoff.
[03:45:56.765 --> 03:46:01.608]  This is a payoff for people who served the government well, who stood up and lied to the American people.
[03:46:02.449 --> 03:46:04.110]  Participate in some of these events.
[03:46:04.110 --> 03:46:09.673]  Who knows how many bodies are buried from the Chertoff regime.
[03:46:09.673 --> 03:46:14.875]  But all this was done to fool the American people and tell them they needed this security theater.
[03:46:14.875 --> 03:46:15.675]  Because it doesn't work.
[03:46:15.675 --> 03:46:19.017]  They even admit it doesn't work in their own reports, which we just showed you.
[03:46:19.017 --> 03:46:20.198]  This is from 2013.
[03:46:20.198 --> 03:46:24.480]  It's a Don Salazar article, internal documents.
[03:46:24.480 --> 03:46:26.661]  Body scanners pat-downs not for terrorists.
[03:46:27.594 --> 03:46:29.515]  That's in a Don Salazar article from 2013.
[03:46:29.515 --> 03:46:32.838]  So we've been covering this for years.
[03:46:32.838 --> 03:46:36.480]  Years and years and we go through it over and over again.
[03:46:36.480 --> 03:46:38.381]  It's just ridiculous.
[03:46:38.381 --> 03:46:40.683]  And I want to find the one that shows.
[03:46:40.683 --> 03:46:41.464]  Here it is.
[03:46:41.464 --> 03:46:42.804]  This is from 2014.
[03:46:42.804 --> 03:46:46.227]  Research definitively proves CSA body scanners are useless.
[03:46:46.647 --> 03:46:59.978]  Researchers with three of the nation's top universities have concluded that TSA body scanners can be easily defeated by anyone with a micodium of know-how confirming what InfoWars reported first two years ago.
[03:46:59.978 --> 03:47:01.279]  So we did that back in 2012.
[03:47:01.279 --> 03:47:10.947]  In essence, the machines which are supposed to detect weapons can be fooled by anyone hiding a weapon on the side of his or her body and render it invisible against the scan's black background.
[03:47:10.947 --> 03:47:14.350]  Did we get John back?
[03:47:14.350 --> 03:47:14.530]  Okay.
[03:47:17.128 --> 03:47:21.471]  Yeah, let's go to, is this the one that's showing people how he defeated it?
[03:47:21.471 --> 03:47:22.552]  Yeah.
[03:47:22.552 --> 03:47:23.672]  Okay, yeah, let's go to that video.
[03:47:23.672 --> 03:47:29.936]  Let's show how easy it is to defeat these body scanners that they say you have to walk through for your safety.
[03:47:29.936 --> 03:47:36.861]  To put it to the test, I bought a sewing kit from the dollar store, broke out my 8th grade home ec skills, and sewed a pocket directly on the side of a shirt.
[03:47:36.861 --> 03:47:40.663]  Then I took a random metallic object, in this case a heavy metal carrying case,
[03:47:41.994 --> 03:47:44.756]  That would easily alarm any of the old metal detectors.
[03:47:44.756 --> 03:47:48.458]  And I walk through a backscatter x-ray at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.
[03:47:48.458 --> 03:47:49.838]  On video, of course.
[03:47:49.838 --> 03:47:56.963]  While I'm not about to win any videography awards for my hidden camera footage, you can watch as I walk through the security line with the metal object in my new side pocket.
[03:47:56.963 --> 03:48:02.906]  My camera gets placed on a conveyor belt and goes through its own x-ray, and when it comes out, I'm through, and the object never left my pocket.
[03:48:03.780 --> 03:48:04.881]  Maybe just a fluke.
[03:48:04.881 --> 03:48:12.665]  Okay, let's try again at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport through one of the TSA's newest machines, a millimeter wave scanner with automated threat detection built in.
[03:48:12.665 --> 03:48:24.372]  With a metallic object in my side pocket, I enter the security line, my device goes through its own x-ray, I pass through, and I exit with the object without any complaints from the TSA.
[03:48:24.372 --> 03:48:24.813]  There it is!
[03:48:26.052 --> 03:48:27.093]  It's funny that he's saying that.
[03:48:47.998 --> 03:49:02.624]  The official media that responded to that video was actually contacted by the TSA's Public Relations Department and threatened against publishing the video, saying that they were helping someone just to disparage the TSA.
[03:49:03.448 --> 03:49:08.110]  If the TSA never came out and said that the video wasn't true, they never came out to refute the claims.
[03:49:08.110 --> 03:49:13.252]  The problem is, the vulnerabilities that I showed the world in 2012 still exist today.
[03:49:13.252 --> 03:49:20.255]  We're going to go into 2016, so about four years later, with the same vulnerability that would allow me to take an AK-47 through a body scanner.
[03:49:21.218 --> 03:49:22.319]  Exactly.
[03:49:22.319 --> 03:49:24.000]  Exactly.
[03:49:24.000 --> 03:49:32.107]  And their next move after you put out that video is to attack you, saying you're bad for putting out this information.
[03:49:32.107 --> 03:49:35.170]  Here's an article from 2012 as well.
[03:49:35.170 --> 03:49:40.675]  John Corbett, TSA and FOO Airport admit lying in FOIA response.
[03:49:40.675 --> 03:49:41.675]  They say they can.
[03:49:41.675 --> 03:49:42.276]  Tell us about that.
[03:49:42.276 --> 03:49:44.498]  They can just lie to you whenever they want as well.
[03:49:44.498 --> 03:49:45.178]  What happened back in 2012?
[03:49:46.738 --> 03:49:52.420]  You know, by law, they have to produce responses to FOIA requests, and they have to be lawful responses.
[03:49:52.420 --> 03:49:59.242]  But the only problem is there's no penalty if they're caught red-handed not doing it.
[03:49:59.242 --> 03:50:06.845]  Basically, the only penalty is that they're asked to release the documents that they were supposed to release in the first place after extensive litigation.
[03:50:06.845 --> 03:50:12.147]  So it's in their interest to basically take these responses and either not respond, or in this case, they flat-out lied.
[03:50:12.147 --> 03:50:16.088]  They flat-out told me they didn't have security video, when in fact it turned out they did.
[03:50:17.298 --> 03:50:18.659]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:50:18.659 --> 03:50:26.001]  You know, and you're going to believe that they don't have security cameras set up in that little area where they're going through all these pat-downs.
[03:50:26.001 --> 03:50:27.442]  It's ludicrous!
[03:50:27.442 --> 03:50:32.684]  They have this little... there, and they have signs that say, this camera is under video surveillance.
[03:50:32.684 --> 03:50:38.306]  So I went back, took pictures of the sign of the domes, and I said, well, if these aren't your cameras, whose are they?
[03:50:38.945 --> 03:50:41.247]  And then they finally admitted that there were cameras.
[03:50:41.247 --> 03:50:42.468]  Yeah, ridiculous.
[03:50:42.468 --> 03:50:45.490]  John, you're going to be back on Thursday with Alex talking more about this.
[03:50:45.490 --> 03:50:47.911]  I mean, just going through the entire lives of the TSA.
[03:50:47.911 --> 03:50:49.212]  I can't wait to see that interview.
[03:50:49.212 --> 03:50:51.274]  Thank you for joining us now.
[03:50:51.274 --> 03:50:56.858]  John Corbett of... I'm going to go to your website when we come back, professional-troublemaker.com.

[03:54:09.386 --> 03:54:10.587]  Join us tonight at 7 p.m.
[03:54:10.587 --> 03:54:12.628]  Central for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:54:12.628 --> 03:54:13.688]  David Knight will be hosting.
[03:54:13.688 --> 03:54:18.411]  He's going to be talking about all the wars that are coming our way in 2016.
[03:54:18.411 --> 03:54:26.054]  He's also going to be interviewing Larry Pratt to talk about a new bill that's coming after your assault weapons.
[03:54:26.054 --> 03:54:33.038]  Although some like to call them semi-automatics or defense weapons for when crazy people
[03:54:34.645 --> 03:54:34.805]  Yes, sir.
[03:54:49.386 --> 03:54:55.248]  Basically, we're gearing it around these gift cards that you get throughout the year, Christmas, birthday.
[03:54:55.248 --> 03:54:56.348]  People use them.
[03:54:56.348 --> 03:54:57.128]  It's a $50 gift card.
[03:54:57.128 --> 03:55:00.149]  You buy something that's $40, you get $10 left on it.
[03:55:00.149 --> 03:55:01.650]  Grab all those old gift cards.
[03:55:01.650 --> 03:55:03.270]  Go use them at the InfoWars store.
[03:55:03.270 --> 03:55:07.031]  It supports what we're doing, and it's money that you're leaving sitting around.
[03:55:07.031 --> 03:55:12.253]  That's why these companies love giving out gift cards, because people use them once, they got a little bit left over.
[03:55:12.253 --> 03:55:14.994]  Billions of dollars go left unspent.
[03:55:15.802 --> 03:55:28.549]  So, grab your, find your old gift cards, see how much is left on them, get on InfoWarsStore.com, we got InfoWarsLife, we've got some survivalist products, we've got water filters, anything you can think of.
[03:55:28.549 --> 03:55:29.910]  We've got some great movies.
[03:55:29.910 --> 03:55:35.033]  Hey, maybe pick up a copy of Police Day for the Rise of FEMA, go to Chapter 8, learn about the underwear bomber.
[03:55:35.033 --> 03:55:42.918]  And what was interesting about this is as we were making this film, which had nothing to do with the underwear bomber, it hadn't even happened yet, it kicks off in December of 2009.
[03:55:45.854 --> 03:55:47.415]  That starts happening.
[03:55:47.415 --> 03:55:52.979]  And as we're making this, I go, Alex, we've got to add this to the movie.
[03:55:52.979 --> 03:55:57.143]  And it ends up being a pretty long segment in the movie.
[03:55:57.143 --> 03:55:57.983]  How long is it?
[03:55:57.983 --> 03:56:00.025]  It is 2 hours and 15 minutes.
[03:56:00.025 --> 03:56:02.206]  Plus, we've got 33 minutes of bonus footage.
[03:56:02.206 --> 03:56:03.988]  It's a very long film.
[03:56:03.988 --> 03:56:08.931]  I'm proud to be a co-director on that with Alex Jones and Jason Douglas.
[03:56:08.931 --> 03:56:13.395]  And it was just about a year in production and post-production.
[03:56:13.835 --> 03:56:28.298]  Well, so go to Pittsburgh, show you what they were doing there for the G20, how they were training the police to see us as animals and as people that should be shot at with pepper spray, beanbags, and sound cannons.
[03:56:28.298 --> 03:56:29.499]  That was all training.
[03:56:29.499 --> 03:56:34.660]  They brought police from all over the country to learn how to control you, because they're getting that government money.
[03:56:36.292 --> 03:56:37.333]  And that's the way that goes.
[03:56:37.333 --> 03:56:39.775]  So definitely join us tonight at 7 p.m.
[03:56:39.775 --> 03:56:41.096]  Central.
[03:56:41.096 --> 03:56:46.119]  I don't even know what's on the Drudge Report right now.
[03:56:46.119 --> 03:56:48.681]  I haven't even checked.
[03:56:48.681 --> 03:56:50.122]  ISIS top story in 2015.
[03:56:50.122 --> 03:56:53.004]  It should be ISIS funded by U.S.
[03:56:53.004 --> 03:56:53.385]  government.
[03:56:53.385 --> 03:56:56.147]  Top story in 2015.
[03:56:56.147 --> 03:57:02.471]  FEC chair who sought to regulate Drudge slams colleagues as dysfunctional.
[03:57:02.471 --> 03:57:04.133]  Refresh that one.
[03:57:04.133 --> 03:57:04.593]  Is this old?
[03:57:08.240 --> 03:57:11.302]  I don't know how to work an iPad.
[03:57:11.302 --> 03:57:11.842]  Ah, there it is.
[03:57:11.842 --> 03:57:12.222]  Poll.
[03:57:12.222 --> 03:57:14.083]  Clinton Trump in dead heat.
[03:57:14.083 --> 03:57:15.084]  So this is new.
[03:57:15.084 --> 03:57:16.004]  Alright.
[03:57:16.004 --> 03:57:18.045]  CNN anchor passes out on live TV.
[03:57:18.045 --> 03:57:19.446]  She's six months pregnant.
[03:57:19.446 --> 03:57:24.269]  But she probably has to work to pay to live wherever CNN's broadcasting.
[03:57:24.269 --> 03:57:27.571]  She can't afford to not work at this point.
[03:57:28.517 --> 03:57:30.578]  And then you can see Granny's Magical Christmas.
[03:57:30.578 --> 03:57:34.879]  There's Hare Hillary out walking with her grandchild.
[03:57:34.879 --> 03:57:37.880]  Well, you should look into who the Clinton daughter married.
[03:57:37.880 --> 03:57:38.540]  Very interesting.
[03:57:38.540 --> 03:57:40.701]  And there's Bill in the background.
[03:57:40.701 --> 03:57:44.062]  They're going to pull Bill out, try to push Hillary in your face.
[03:57:44.062 --> 03:57:45.382]  You going to let them do it?
[03:57:46.564 --> 03:57:51.589]  Hopefully you'll be out there at some of these events Hillary's at, asking her questions she doesn't want to answer.
[03:57:51.589 --> 03:57:52.790]  Ask her about the emails.
[03:57:52.790 --> 03:57:54.371]  Ask her about Benghazi.
[03:57:54.371 --> 03:57:56.633]  Ask her about what she did at the State Department.
[03:57:56.633 --> 03:57:58.815]  Yeah, what did you do about bullying?
[03:57:58.815 --> 03:57:59.616]  People be mean.
[03:57:59.616 --> 03:58:02.679]  Yeah, ask her about issues of no significance, like bullying.
[03:58:02.679 --> 03:58:07.744]  You know, one way to defeat a bully is to punch them in the nose and usually back down pretty quickly.
[03:58:08.840 --> 03:58:10.642]  That's our show for today.
