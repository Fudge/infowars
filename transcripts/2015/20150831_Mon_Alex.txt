[00:00:05.342 --> 00:00:06.644]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.644 --> 00:00:08.426]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.426 --> 00:00:10.188]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.188 --> 00:00:11.750]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.313]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:17.498]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.498 --> 00:00:21.563]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.254 --> 00:00:46.703]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this Monday, August 31st, 2015 worldwide transmission.
[00:00:46.703 --> 00:00:49.846]  We're going to be looking at the latest developments with the world economy.
[00:00:49.846 --> 00:00:52.649]  We're going to be looking at the latest developments in election 2016.
[00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.351]  We're going to be interviewing
[00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:04.129]  Matthew Heinemann, the incredible director of the film Cartel Land.
[00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:14.035]  It's one of the most daring documentaries I've ever seen inside the government-controlled drug war in Mexico.
[00:01:14.035 --> 00:01:16.417]  It didn't win the Sundance
[00:01:18.021 --> 00:01:21.862]  Sundance Film Festival Best Documentary Award as well.
[00:01:21.862 --> 00:01:30.484]  He will be joining us coming up to look at what could happen in America, what's already happening in the United States under this phony drug war.
[00:01:30.484 --> 00:01:39.506]  We'll have strong criticisms of the drug war and strike directly at the root of it that is helping degenerate our society into a dark age bedlam.
[00:01:40.575 --> 00:01:50.763]  Bonnie Hari's launching a new initiative today, The Food Babe, and we've got a bunch of news we're going to break down on the fight for health freedom, the fight to be able to choose the food we eat, and the labeling.
[00:01:50.763 --> 00:01:54.607]  A lot of breaking news on that front.
[00:01:54.607 --> 00:02:00.592]  That said, interspersed with those guests today, I'm lining up right now
[00:02:03.027 --> 00:02:28.233]  Either at the bottom of this hour or in the fourth hour during overdrive, and if not tomorrow, a gentleman that comes highly recommended by Sheriff Richard Mack and by others, who is running for sheriff down in Houston in Harris County, and he can give us the inside scoop on exactly what's going on down there with this police officer, the sheriff's deputy that was shot dead Friday.
[00:02:29.193 --> 00:02:37.300]  And it took the mainstream media until today to even begin to say, oh, it might have been racially motivated.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.661]  This is all the White House.
[00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:47.468]  This is all MSNBC, MTV pushing this and triggering mentally ill people to take action.
[00:02:47.468 --> 00:02:49.690]  And it goes both ways.
[00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:57.376]  We saw the attack that took place with Roof in Charleston, killing nine people.
[00:02:57.376 --> 00:02:58.577]  And as is tit for tat,
[00:03:01.035 --> 00:03:04.617]  begins to snowball, it can get out of control very, very quickly.
[00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:07.778]  But why would the social engineers be pushing this?
[00:03:07.778 --> 00:03:09.739]  Obviously, it's divide and conquer.
[00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:20.503]  But more importantly, they want a brand revolution, not as going after criminals in government, not in actually going for the head of the snake.
[00:03:20.503 --> 00:03:22.784]  That's above Obama.
[00:03:22.784 --> 00:03:25.245]  The offshore central banks.
[00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:29.507]  But to then have revolution be focused on the average cop on the beat.
[00:03:30.691 --> 00:03:36.975]  And that's because a revolution pointed at the police will fail.
[00:03:36.975 --> 00:03:40.417]  Because it's not a just revolution.
[00:03:40.417 --> 00:03:47.781]  Shooting people in the back is discrediting, it's murderous, it's pathetic.
[00:03:47.781 --> 00:03:50.503]  I don't care if it's a crazed psycho cop or a crazed psycho.
[00:03:51.553 --> 00:03:54.994]  Racist, black guy, white guy, whatever.
[00:03:54.994 --> 00:03:58.155]  On its face, I'll have no part of that revolution.
[00:03:58.155 --> 00:04:06.457]  I will have part in the new renaissance and a rediscovery of what made civilizations great.
[00:04:06.457 --> 00:04:11.058]  I know the ideas I promote will win the fight for the hearts and minds.
[00:04:11.058 --> 00:04:14.559]  All I need is a chance to present them to the public and we'll win.
[00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:17.079]  That's why they fight tooth and nail.
[00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.280]  That's what the Clinton White House papers show at their library.
[00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.371]  I don't know.
[00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:42.062]  So when we come back, the latest.
[00:04:42.062 --> 00:04:43.583]  Here's from the London Guardian.
[00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:48.385]  Central banks can't save the markets from a crash, and they shouldn't even try.
[00:04:48.385 --> 00:04:50.306]  All this and more straight ahead.
[00:04:50.306 --> 00:04:51.426]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:51.426 --> 00:04:53.748]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:04:53.748 --> 00:04:56.249]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:02.989]  I was born on the prairies where the wind blew free.
[00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:05.691]  And there was nothing to break the light of the sun.
[00:05:05.691 --> 00:05:08.573]  I was born where there were no enclosures.
[00:05:08.573 --> 00:05:09.773]  Geronimo.
[00:05:09.773 --> 00:05:14.777]  I wonder what he thinks of the permanent checkpoints where you're quizzed about your citizenship.
[00:05:14.777 --> 00:05:18.680]  About having to submit to bag searches to ride public transportation.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.442]  His thoughts on non-violent offenders riding away in prisons.
[00:05:22.442 --> 00:05:26.165]  They say that in these current times we are more quote, civilized.
[00:05:26.385 --> 00:05:28.888]  But are we really more free?
[00:05:28.888 --> 00:05:37.981]  When the Persian army demanded King Leonidas and his Spartans surrender their arms, the outnumbered king shouted, Molon lave, or come and take them.
[00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:43.969]  Even though Leonidas was eventually defeated by a much larger adversary, he is not remembered for his loss.
[00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:48.234]  He lives in history as a beacon of defiance and self-defense.
[00:05:48.234 --> 00:05:51.697]  The desire to disarm the people is nothing new.
[00:05:51.697 --> 00:05:58.725]  Arm yourself with knowledge at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.TV, and the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.

[00:07:17.161 --> 00:07:29.113]  It is concentrated herbs and natural organic compounds known to energize the body's natural processes that are blocked by estrogen mimickers and other toxic elements in the food chain.
[00:07:29.113 --> 00:07:34.158]  Super Mill Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com has sold out multiple times in the last three months.
[00:07:34.298 --> 00:07:41.882]  To fix that problem, we have now produced the biggest and most concentrated high-quality batch of Super Mel Vitality in the product's history.

[00:07:49.187 --> 00:07:52.148]  Now it's time to get your body in balance and fight back.
[00:07:52.148 --> 00:07:58.172]  I'm Alex Jones for Super Mel Vitality and InfoWarsLife.com, and I salute you, our supporters!
[00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:19.774]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:19.774 --> 00:08:30.882]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:30.882 --> 00:08:43.551]  Revolution in their hearts, the children start to march.
[00:08:46.752 --> 00:08:49.814]  And George Soros is directing them.
[00:08:49.814 --> 00:08:50.375]  Problem.
[00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:51.035]  Reaction.
[00:08:51.035 --> 00:08:52.516]  Solution.
[00:08:52.516 --> 00:08:53.577]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:53.577 --> 00:08:53.897]  Welcome.
[00:08:53.897 --> 00:09:02.924]  Thank you for joining us on this 31st day of August, 2015, this Monday Transmission.
[00:09:02.924 --> 00:09:05.666]  We're going to do a fourth hour of Overdrive today.
[00:09:05.666 --> 00:09:11.951]  Within the next two weeks, we're going to launch the fourth hour live every day, co-hosted by myself most days.
[00:09:12.765 --> 00:09:21.247]  But many days it will be my reporters, their guests, special guests and others co-hosting the fourth hour.
[00:09:21.247 --> 00:09:27.789]  That'll be a roundup of news, the latest breaking news, video clips, special reports.
[00:09:27.789 --> 00:09:29.910]  It's going to be very, very powerful.
[00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.811]  And I'm just getting the reporters warmed up to it.
[00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:43.731]  I mean, they like the idea, but I'm getting them eased into the deep water of live radio slash TV by having different reporters host the show.
[00:09:43.731 --> 00:09:50.136]  So the fourth hour will be hosted by Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs, the dynamic duo today.
[00:09:50.136 --> 00:09:58.462]  And I was going to have this sheriff's candidate down in Harris County, down in Houston on myself.
[00:09:58.462 --> 00:10:01.765]  But I thought, why not just get him on with these guys?
[00:10:03.496 --> 00:10:09.081]  And of course, Richard Mack, he comes highly recommended from Richard Mack, from a lot of other folks.
[00:10:09.081 --> 00:10:13.145]  If you go to his website, he's a former Marine, police officer, you name it.
[00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:28.659]  Carl Pittman, he's got the endorsement of Sheriff Arpaio, and he is running for sheriff down there in the county where the sheriff's deputy in the very sheriff department he's running for was just executed.
[00:10:28.659 --> 00:10:29.560]  Darren, go forth.
[00:10:30.788 --> 00:10:38.515]  So I've been talking via text with Carl Pittman and it comes highly recommended from retired Army Colonel filmmaker Chuck Undersea.
[00:10:38.515 --> 00:10:39.957]  This well knows him.
[00:10:39.957 --> 00:10:41.999]  Chuck put me in contact with him yesterday.
[00:10:41.999 --> 00:10:46.363]  So it looks like we're gonna have Carl Pittman on either in the fourth hour today or tomorrow.
[00:10:46.363 --> 00:10:48.404]  The reason I'm excited about it is
[00:10:49.406 --> 00:10:54.550]  He sounds, acts just like a David Clark.
[00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:59.674]  Really smart, focused, patriotic, not left, not right, a constitutionalist.
[00:10:59.674 --> 00:11:02.436]  Says he wants to restore the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:11:02.436 --> 00:11:06.519]  That's the type of sheriffs and police chiefs we need in this country.
[00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:15.526]  Not little federal minions that basically just repeat the whole Southern Poverty Law Center garbage.
[00:11:15.526 --> 00:11:16.387]  Because make no mistake,
[00:11:17.622 --> 00:11:22.767]  George Soros has overthrown more than 15 countries in the last 30 years.
[00:11:22.767 --> 00:11:25.109]  The last one was Ukraine two years ago.
[00:11:25.109 --> 00:11:29.954]  George Soros has openly tried to crash the U.S.
[00:11:29.954 --> 00:11:31.415]  dollar, repeatedly, on record.
[00:11:31.415 --> 00:11:32.356]  He's proud of it.
[00:11:32.356 --> 00:11:36.540]  George Soros is a wanted man in multiple European countries.
[00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:50.436]  George Soros is funding the racist, kill the cops, kill the white people, Black Lives Matter movement that is being given so much attention and support by the White House.
[00:11:50.436 --> 00:11:59.501]  And that's being done to build revolution as attacking local government so the feds can come in as the savior.
[00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:01.622]  Period.
[00:12:01.622 --> 00:12:06.104]  This is a destabilization operation and many departments are intimidated by this.
[00:12:07.366 --> 00:12:21.738]  So they're rolling over and telling the feds, you come in and you tell us how to run our operations and you tell us how to hire and who to fire and we'll do whatever you say and basically become federalized and embed BATF agents in every major unit.
[00:12:21.738 --> 00:12:23.599]  I mean, it's a nightmare scenario.
[00:12:23.599 --> 00:12:25.000]  It's happening right now.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.104]  And this is the intimidation, this is the political correctness, this is the takeover.
[00:12:30.104 --> 00:12:32.346]  Are there problems in departments across the country?
[00:12:32.346 --> 00:12:32.907]  Absolutely.
[00:12:33.843 --> 00:12:34.883]  Is there militarization?
[00:12:34.883 --> 00:12:35.983]  That's a problem.
[00:12:35.983 --> 00:12:36.724]  Absolutely.
[00:12:36.724 --> 00:12:56.528]  But it's the globalists that set up that culture, set it up to fail, give them all the federal riot gear, the MRAPs, the sound cannons, the microwave guns, and then tell them the Tea Party and veterans are the enemy, and then they have the media promote some isolated but truly disgusting events,
[00:12:57.645 --> 00:13:15.743]  and very questionable events of police officers killing innocent people and then they project that and make it racial wrapped up in class envy a classic bonafide one hundred and ten percent destabilization communist tactic
[00:13:16.533 --> 00:13:36.818]  And if you look at where Obama and Reverend Wright and all these people come from, it is directly out of the Communist Manifesto, it is directly out of Bill Ayers, it is directly out of Rules for Radicals, Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book to Lucifer, who Hillary Clinton wrote a bunch of letters to praising his tactics.
[00:13:36.818 --> 00:13:40.979]  How did Obama get his cousin Odinga the prime ministership of Kenya?
[00:13:40.979 --> 00:13:42.580]  There was no such thing as a prime ministership.
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.560]  There was an elected president.
[00:13:44.858 --> 00:13:54.463]  When he and his Muslim minority couldn't get elected president, Obama told them in an open letter, start riots, don't stop, and they will give you a position in the government.
[00:13:54.463 --> 00:13:55.763]  And they did.
[00:13:55.763 --> 00:14:02.767]  That's what these tactics are, is terrorism, and I don't use that term lightly, and bullying.
[00:14:02.767 --> 00:14:11.431]  True terrorism is violence, or the threat of violence, for a political or economic aim.
[00:14:12.895 --> 00:14:19.420]  Look up the classic definition, and that's what you'll find.
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.244]  And this is horribly evil people with unbelievable wealth.
[00:14:24.244 --> 00:14:26.566]  George Soros isn't just worth 10 million, folks.
[00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:28.428]  He's got accounts all over the world.
[00:14:28.428 --> 00:14:30.049]  He's well-known to be one of these shadow elites.
[00:14:30.049 --> 00:14:36.715]  And I use Soros because he's the most visible, arrogant head of all this.
[00:14:36.715 --> 00:14:41.639]  But beneath that, beneath that iceberg tip, there's a giant organization
[00:14:42.571 --> 00:14:50.214]  The Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Endowment, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with Warren Buffett.
[00:14:50.214 --> 00:14:55.276]  There is all the ACORN type groups and organizations.
[00:14:55.276 --> 00:15:06.260]  Battleground Texas, all these groups are pushing for a cultural clash, are pushing for a major
[00:15:07.682 --> 00:15:14.007]  Crisis out of which the feds themselves controlled by offshore interest can come in as the saviors.
[00:15:14.007 --> 00:15:20.392]  And again, Forbes says that Soros is worth 24 billion dollars.
[00:15:20.392 --> 00:15:27.817]  And then it gets into how George Soros is the winner of Obama's war on coal, shutting down almost half our coal power plants.
[00:15:27.817 --> 00:15:31.100]  Turns out Soros is invested in the alternatives to that.
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.541]  See how these people operate?
[00:15:34.073 --> 00:15:37.016]  They are mafia kingpins.
[00:15:37.016 --> 00:15:39.638]  Who else could be a Nazi collaborator?
[00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:47.044]  A hound sniffing out hidden Jews and teaching the Nazis the Jewish tactics to hide their wealth and escape.
[00:15:47.044 --> 00:15:51.388]  But George Soros when he was 14, 15, and 16.
[00:15:51.388 --> 00:15:55.472]  And then not getting in trouble and basically running the Democratic Party today.
[00:15:55.472 --> 00:15:56.833]  It's outrageous.
[00:16:00.077 --> 00:16:07.384]  And you don't hear a word from the Jewish organizations about it because they're bought and paid for and controlled by the very same interest.
[00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:10.107]  It's sickening.
[00:16:10.107 --> 00:16:13.671]  Truly sickening.
[00:16:13.671 --> 00:16:16.514]  I mean, I've got more videos we could play for you.
[00:16:18.194 --> 00:16:34.606]  I've seen more than 20 Black Lives Matters videos from Texas and New York and Missouri where they say, pigs in a blanket, only good pigs have wings, let's give pigs wings, that means angels, you know, kill them.
[00:16:34.606 --> 00:16:38.309]  Outright chants, deck the halls with dead cops, fa la la la la la.
[00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:48.937]  And then the cops are being shot, they are being killed on a weekly basis, when they're in their patrol cars, when they're pumping gas, when they're at accident scenes.
[00:16:48.937 --> 00:17:02.461]  And all that's going to make the police do is freak out even more and get even more paranoid of people in general, but black folks particularly, to where they will slow roll and will not respond in your neighborhoods and you'll be fed on by criminals.
[00:17:04.051 --> 00:17:25.233]  And yes, they will then be paranoid and will lash out and will be heavy-handed and it'll create incredible friction and divide and conquer that'll be visited upon innocent people and that's exactly what George Soros and the Democrats want because that will then drive you even more to the Democratic Party's rebranding as a pure racial organization
[00:17:25.874 --> 00:17:30.775]  Like they were in the days of the Klan, but this time for black people, Hispanics, and others.
[00:17:30.775 --> 00:17:42.957]  And they'll coddle, and they'll have TV shows about how you're victims, and how they're going to get the bad cops, and how they're going to federalize them, when the whole time they played the entire paradigm.
[00:17:42.957 --> 00:17:53.640]  And there is a new video out today, Black Lives Matter chant called Disgusting by Police Leader, CBS News, Minnesota, David Clark.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.100]  And they marched yesterday,
[00:17:56.443 --> 00:18:02.527]  And chanted, pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon.
[00:18:02.527 --> 00:18:09.791]  What officers and others say they find offensive is also protected free speech.
[00:18:09.791 --> 00:18:19.517]  When you start saying, kill people, which some of these groups have actually said, you know, we need to see dead cops.
[00:18:19.517 --> 00:18:23.320]  When that gets pushed, it is no longer free speech.
[00:18:25.128 --> 00:18:31.754]  But all that has to happen is the police have to realize that they need to get their house in order in many cases.
[00:18:31.754 --> 00:18:33.696]  They understand they've been set up.
[00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:37.099]  They need to understand that globalization is here.
[00:18:37.099 --> 00:18:40.062]  The local takeover of states, counties and cities is here.
[00:18:40.062 --> 00:18:43.966]  And the social engineers need to have a way
[00:18:46.923 --> 00:19:01.159]  To again brand the civil war they're going to start as racially based and then that's the smoke screen for the UN and the globalist in phase two to come in with the new reconciliation UN run government.
[00:19:02.093 --> 00:19:14.639]  Which is actually being proposed right now, to have the UN come in and oversee our elections, open our borders up, the Pope's coming to speak, probably in the middle of more stock market collapse, more racial tension.
[00:19:14.639 --> 00:19:27.086]  You can see all this being lined up right now, and just last week, two cops got shot and killed, in racially motivated activity, it's clear, and we see the
[00:19:28.154 --> 00:19:35.359]  Reporter and the cameraman killed and the guy wants to start a race war, he says, and the media won't even call it racially based.
[00:19:35.359 --> 00:19:37.700]  Can you imagine if a white guy went and did this?
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:48.928]  You'd never hear the end of it, which we didn't with the Charleston situation, which again, he said he was doing it because of the race war that he saw from his perspective from MSNBC.
[00:19:48.928 --> 00:19:52.190]  So they're triggering both sides to do this.
[00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:55.492]  It's an example of mass mind control.
[00:19:55.492 --> 00:19:57.253]  We'll be back and tell you where it's all going.
[00:19:57.253 --> 00:19:57.674]  Stay with us.
[00:19:59.655 --> 00:20:02.116]  Honey, why are there fish swimming in our bathtub?
[00:20:02.116 --> 00:20:03.056]  Aren't they cute?
[00:20:03.056 --> 00:20:08.218]  You need more Omega-3s, and those fish oil pills with toxins and heavy metals are scary.
[00:20:08.218 --> 00:20:10.319]  So I'm making fish oil from scratch.
[00:20:10.319 --> 00:20:10.759]  Oh, boy.
[00:20:10.759 --> 00:20:13.280]  Didn't I tell you I'm ordering Nutrigold fish oil?
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.981]  It's exceptionally pure.
[00:20:14.981 --> 00:20:16.482]  That's what they all say.
[00:20:16.482 --> 00:20:17.202]  No, really.
[00:20:17.202 --> 00:20:24.185]  Nutrigold's fish oil is concentrated from pure cold water fish straight off the Alaskan coast and manufactured right here in the USA.
[00:20:24.545 --> 00:20:30.129]  Well, cold Alaskan waters are much more pristine than the polluted waters that other fish oils are sourced from.
[00:20:30.129 --> 00:20:31.250]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:36.233]  And it's 5-star certified to meet international purity, potency, and freshness standards.
[00:20:36.233 --> 00:20:37.674]  Well, that sounds even better!
[00:20:37.674 --> 00:20:38.094]  Great.
[00:20:38.094 --> 00:20:40.056]  I'll be in my office ordering a few bottles.

[00:23:56.352 --> 00:23:57.233]  Come and take it!
[00:24:20.724 --> 00:24:25.387]  One of the chants heard from protesters is being called disgusting by rank-and-file St.
[00:24:25.387 --> 00:24:26.828]  Paul police officers.
[00:24:26.828 --> 00:24:33.892]  Police Federation leaders say the threatening refrain is divisive and dangerous and won't lead to improved police relations.
[00:24:33.892 --> 00:24:37.555]  As Bill Hudson explains, march organizers say they're not about to apologize.
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:48.764]  By most accounts, it was a peaceful march down Snelling Avenue, though intended to disrupt leisure to deliver a message of justice.
[00:24:48.764 --> 00:24:52.506]  We weren't surprised that it was peaceful, but we were glad that everything worked out right.
[00:24:52.506 --> 00:24:56.388]  But along the way, protesters broke into a pointed refrain.
[00:24:59.389 --> 00:25:02.911]  What some may find offensive is also free speech.
[00:25:02.911 --> 00:25:09.574]  What's ironic here is that marchers were being protected by the very officers targeted in the chant.
[00:25:09.574 --> 00:25:11.795]  Statements and chants like that are just ignorant.
[00:25:11.795 --> 00:25:13.676]  You know, I find it absolutely disgusting.
[00:25:14.056 --> 00:25:15.938]  Officer Dave Titus heads the St.
[00:25:15.938 --> 00:25:17.640]  Paul Police Federation.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:26.488]  He called it dangerous and outrageous rhetoric, especially coming just hours after a Texas deputy was gunned down in cold blood.
[00:25:26.488 --> 00:25:37.419]  I don't think chanting or singing chants that are basically promoting killing police officers is peaceful.
[00:25:37.759 --> 00:25:43.564]  March organizer Rashad Turner says there's a big difference between words and actions.
[00:25:43.564 --> 00:25:44.926]  It definitely wasn't a threat.
[00:25:44.926 --> 00:25:49.290]  You know, I don't know if they would have received it differently if we'd have said maybe on a stick or something like that.
[00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:52.573]  But, you know, we're out there chanting, we're using our voices.
[00:25:52.573 --> 00:25:55.756]  Rhetoric that doesn't appear to have stopped with a march.
[00:25:55.756 --> 00:25:57.117]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:25:57.117 --> 00:26:02.162]  Alright, and that is some of the mild stuff that's being pushed, but here's the deal.
[00:26:03.021 --> 00:26:05.602]  These Black Lives Matter groups are useful idiots.
[00:26:05.602 --> 00:26:11.083]  They're run by the social engineers at the Ford Foundation, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the White House, Hillary.
[00:26:11.083 --> 00:26:12.544]  They're all connected.
[00:26:12.544 --> 00:26:14.724]  George Soros funds the whole thing.
[00:26:14.724 --> 00:26:17.285]  This is meant to create bad race relations.
[00:26:17.285 --> 00:26:21.126]  When you're in a restaurant or driving down the road, people beating on your car, blocking the road.
[00:26:21.126 --> 00:26:28.528]  I mean, we've had some of the Black Lives Matter thug types, black and white, show up and threaten to attack our reporters.
[00:26:28.528 --> 00:26:31.649]  Reporters have been attacked all over the country, including black reporters.
[00:26:32.611 --> 00:26:35.632]  It's an excuse to go out and act like thugs.
[00:26:35.632 --> 00:26:43.114]  And I'll just say it, you look at the actual Black Lives Matter group, not protesters against police brutality or problems, they're very legitimate.
[00:26:43.114 --> 00:26:49.555]  I'll be honest, it looks like a bunch of lazy, stupid, super overweight, dumb couch potatoes.
[00:26:49.555 --> 00:26:56.757]  And I'm not attacking folks that get overweight, but on average those people probably weighed 350 pounds in Minnesota.
[00:26:56.757 --> 00:26:58.958]  I mean, they've been sitting around on a couch, on welfare,
[00:27:01.306 --> 00:27:10.371]  Watching TV all day, watching MSNBC, actually believing white people are hiding under the table and are going to come out and kill them.
[00:27:10.371 --> 00:27:26.019]  And it's just so sad to watch these spoiled brats who are entitled, including all the little white politically correct yuppies that I've seen in countless videos, you know, chanting, deck the halls with dead cops and pigs in a blanket, you know, fry them like bacon.
[00:27:27.358 --> 00:27:33.560]  I see the comments online, the tweets, time to start busting caps in them, time to start killing cops.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:37.062]  People praise on Twitter.
[00:27:37.062 --> 00:27:41.743]  Watson's on vacation for the next week, but if our writers want to go to Twitter, that's a story right there.
[00:27:41.743 --> 00:27:43.624]  I saw it this morning and this weekend.
[00:27:43.624 --> 00:27:45.905]  I forgot to tell you, people praising the dead cop.
[00:27:45.905 --> 00:27:47.886]  That'll teach these cops how to behave.
[00:27:47.886 --> 00:27:48.746]  No, it won't.
[00:27:48.746 --> 00:27:53.748]  It'll make the cops become more militaristic, more paranoid.
[00:27:53.748 --> 00:27:56.489]  Again, the central government
[00:27:57.984 --> 00:28:11.490]  wants to start a race war in this country, as I've been saying for many years, and they're going to start it right when the economic collapse starts, to act like the collapse is caused by the riots, by the destabilization.
[00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:15.152]  They'll also probably start a foreign war right when the collapse comes.
[00:28:15.152 --> 00:28:17.253]  Notice what's happening off the coast of China.
[00:28:17.253 --> 00:28:18.814]  Notice what's happening in North Korea.
[00:28:18.814 --> 00:28:20.394]  Notice what's happening in Ukraine.
[00:28:20.394 --> 00:28:22.515]  Notice what's happening in Georgia right now.
[00:28:22.515 --> 00:28:25.937]  The world is moving into chaos by design.
[00:28:27.517 --> 00:28:28.918]  And that's why I get so upset.
[00:28:28.918 --> 00:28:30.139]  We need to stop this.
[00:28:30.139 --> 00:28:32.500]  This is stupid.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.343]  All lives matter, and all black lives matter.
[00:28:36.343 --> 00:28:49.051]  You want to get upset about some dead black people, maybe a couple hundred black people get shot and killed in questionable circumstances by the police, and that's too many.
[00:28:49.051 --> 00:28:51.013]  But, I mean, we've talked about it.
[00:28:52.266 --> 00:28:58.288]  50 plus percent of black people never get born in this country, they get aborted, and they're targeted for that.
[00:28:58.288 --> 00:29:01.329]  But I can't get any of these leftist black people to care!
[00:29:01.329 --> 00:29:12.613]  Because it's too much fun to tune into Al Sharpton and to be manipulated, to be played with, to be absolutely scammed!
[00:29:12.613 --> 00:29:16.054]  And for the police as well, I'm going to talk about this in the second hour.
[00:29:18.851 --> 00:29:20.735]  Drug culture is bad.
[00:29:20.735 --> 00:29:22.137]  Drugs attract bad people.
[00:29:22.137 --> 00:29:25.143]  It's got a lot of bad things connected to it.
[00:29:25.143 --> 00:29:26.505]  And by making drugs illegal...
[00:29:27.839 --> 00:29:33.062]  In the 30s, it made it lucrative, it made it criminal, and it made it get worse.
[00:29:33.062 --> 00:29:42.327]  And no one can deny that criminal central banks are shipping drugs in and using the drug war to corrupt the police.
[00:29:42.327 --> 00:29:46.850]  So we'll talk about problems with the police in the second hour, okay?
[00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:48.751]  But the answer is not randomly shooting cops in the head.
[00:29:48.751 --> 00:29:49.932]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.932 --> 00:29:52.453]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.453 --> 00:29:55.135]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.083]  Here's a story for all you supporters of the war on drugs.
[00:30:02.083 --> 00:30:07.308]  Cocaine production plummets after DEA kicked out of Bolivia from the website TheAntimedia.org.
[00:30:07.308 --> 00:30:15.337]  According to data released by the United Nations, cocaine production in that country declined by 11% in the past year, making the fourth year in a row of steady decrease.
[00:30:15.337 --> 00:30:18.060]  It was just seven years ago that the DEA was kicked out of Bolivia.
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.864]  And only three years after that, progress was finally made.
[00:30:20.864 --> 00:30:27.894]  The strategy employed by the Bolivian government may surprise many prohibitionists because it did not involve strong-arm police state tactics.
[00:30:27.894 --> 00:30:32.881]  Instead, they worked to find alternative crops for farmers to grow that would actually make them more money.
[00:30:32.881 --> 00:30:34.343]  Bolivia has adopted a policy

[00:32:34.304 --> 00:32:34.644]  We're good.
[00:33:09.215 --> 00:33:14.876]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:14.876 --> 00:33:17.256]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:17.256 --> 00:33:29.079]  I have worked tirelessly for 20 years to fight the construction of the police state.
[00:33:37.961 --> 00:33:45.989]  To stop the globalization of the federal government and the globalization of local police through the federal government.
[00:33:45.989 --> 00:33:56.539]  We did succeed in informing the public of the danger, but we failed in stopping the transformation.
[00:33:56.539 --> 00:34:01.865]  But just as Homeland Security was set up to supposedly protect us from Al-Qaeda,
[00:34:03.223 --> 00:34:12.852]  Now our government openly funds Al Qaeda and ISIS and tells us that Homeland Security is mainly for veterans, gun owners, and the Tea Party, and Christians.
[00:34:12.852 --> 00:34:21.501]  And the IRS publicly, openly, nakedly targets and persecutes Christians, Second Amendment groups, veterans groups.
[00:34:21.501 --> 00:34:28.107]  There is a war on veterans, on police,
[00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:37.030]  On gun owners, on property owners, on Christians, on libertarians.
[00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:45.292]  Because we aren't compatible with this new collectivist world government system.
[00:34:45.292 --> 00:34:56.634]  And that's why it's so wonderful to have all of these different black sheriffs and people running for sheriff around the country
[00:34:58.444 --> 00:35:10.295]  Who happened to be black because it absolutely sabotages the narrative that if you're a quote minority you can't be in the liberty movement.
[00:35:10.295 --> 00:35:19.424]  Plus I've heard this particular man running for sheriff down in Houston give a speech and I mean David Clark
[00:35:20.473 --> 00:35:20.653]  I think?
[00:35:40.489 --> 00:35:41.129]  Together.
[00:35:41.129 --> 00:35:42.949]  It's over for the globalists.
[00:35:42.949 --> 00:35:47.310]  And I know that's obvious, but that's why they're pushing racial division.
[00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:51.771]  It's so disgusting how naked it is.
[00:35:51.771 --> 00:35:54.551]  The word is naked.
[00:35:54.551 --> 00:35:56.772]  It's so obvious they're doing it.
[00:35:56.772 --> 00:35:58.552]  They admit they're doing it.
[00:35:58.552 --> 00:36:02.053]  It's so diabolical, it's criminal.
[00:36:02.053 --> 00:36:09.654]  It is sedition to spend $33 million in Ferguson alone in the last year and a half
[00:36:16.226 --> 00:36:33.895]  To have Soros combined with the media openly trying to create just absolute hysterical feverish hatred at injustice that is blown out of proportion to where it's the only issue in the world.
[00:36:33.895 --> 00:36:40.118]  And then to point that politically at local government, it's so crystal clear what this is meant to do.
[00:36:43.427 --> 00:36:46.529]  And it lets you know that we have seen only the beginning.
[00:36:46.529 --> 00:37:07.345]  Can you imagine with the Obamacare, and the borders open, and the power plants getting shut off, and the attacks on the Second Amendment outside of law, and the funding of ISIS and Al Qaeda, and the world government being announced, the lawlessness of the people that have grabbed control of our government.
[00:37:08.996 --> 00:37:14.781]  Why are they now in a campaign demonizing state government?
[00:37:14.781 --> 00:37:23.128]  Because they know when things get really bad, the avenue to stop it will be the states getting together and saying no to the captured federal government.
[00:37:23.128 --> 00:37:37.019]  They know that's the main constitutional avenue, and so they're already preparing it like it's Civil War II in the narrative, where the average Democrat that you talk to thinks 1776 was when the South was defeated.
[00:37:39.466 --> 00:37:41.907]  Or when Hitler was defeated.
[00:37:41.907 --> 00:38:02.172]  People think 4th of July, we've gone out in Austin, we've gone out in California, and trendies believe that the American consciousness is the Civil War or is World War II, and then they project our war with the Nazis back onto America and imply that the police
[00:38:03.263 --> 00:38:05.923]  And white people are all Nazis.
[00:38:05.923 --> 00:38:13.265]  This is the Hollywood narrative and it's so incredibly ass-backwards.
[00:38:13.265 --> 00:38:28.368]  But when you've got an ignorant public that can't tell you the three branches of government, that can't tell you the state capital on average, that can't tell you who the vice president is in many cases.
[00:38:28.368 --> 00:38:29.968]  There's a new video on InfoWars.com
[00:38:32.159 --> 00:38:45.625]  That Mark Dice went out and shot in Southern California where people believe the Loch Ness Monster has been captured and is being held at SeaWorld.
[00:38:45.625 --> 00:38:58.371]  This is the same place he goes to the university and to the beachfront boardwalk where 8 out of 10 people say put gun owners in forced labor camps.
[00:38:58.371 --> 00:39:00.912]  Where 8 out of 10 people say ban the Bill of Rights for Hillary.
[00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:05.733]  And these aren't people that can't speak English.
[00:39:05.733 --> 00:39:11.597]  These are articulate people where he goes, yeah, we want to put them in, you know, forced labor camps and take their guns and imprison them.
[00:39:11.597 --> 00:39:16.180]  And the Democrat guy goes, you don't tell me, buddy, I'm ready.
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:21.324]  These are folks lusting after power, lusting after political correctness.
[00:39:24.457 --> 00:39:32.903]  And they will do whatever they're told by the establishment because they don't have a worldview.
[00:39:32.903 --> 00:39:38.127]  They regurgitate whatever they're told.
[00:39:38.127 --> 00:39:50.216]  And more and more of this country is filled with people like this, who are just automatons, who want to sit on the couch and get their welfare check all day.
[00:39:50.216 --> 00:39:53.258]  That's the pressure from below, and the pressure from above.
[00:39:56.274 --> 00:40:13.889]  The pressure being driven down by the less than one-tenth of one percent of the ultra-rich to play the giant unwashed mass off against the liberty, the property, the engine of freedom that's left in this country.
[00:40:13.889 --> 00:40:17.833]  This is a consolidation war.
[00:40:17.833 --> 00:40:20.115]  And it's so essential for viewers to understand
[00:40:21.141 --> 00:40:22.602]  This is not talk.
[00:40:22.602 --> 00:40:24.123]  This is not hyperbole.
[00:40:24.123 --> 00:40:27.905]  This is not talking points or rhetoric.
[00:40:27.905 --> 00:40:40.072]  I do not have the vocabulary to describe to you how real this is and how diabolical this is and how serious this is.
[00:40:44.195 --> 00:40:55.731]  The Globalists plan to bring in another 30, 40, 50 million illegals, baptize them into socialist communist ideology, Bill Ayers, Bernadine Smith, Saul Alinsky ideology.
[00:40:55.731 --> 00:40:57.454]  They will stage terror attacks.
[00:40:57.454 --> 00:40:58.736]  They will blame it on the Liberty Movement.
[00:41:00.282 --> 00:41:07.568]  And they will have a purge and they will arrest hundreds of thousands of veterans, police, patriots, you name it.
[00:41:07.568 --> 00:41:11.051]  If we don't get involved and get aggressive, that's where they want to take us.
[00:41:11.051 --> 00:41:12.752]  They say they want to arrest us.
[00:41:12.752 --> 00:41:14.473]  They say they want to come after us.
[00:41:14.473 --> 00:41:17.135]  They say they want to kill us.
[00:41:17.135 --> 00:41:22.059]  And this happens in most other countries when they become corrupt and collapse.
[00:41:22.059 --> 00:41:26.363]  Why then don't people understand it's happening here?
[00:41:26.363 --> 00:41:27.624]  They hate bitter clingers.
[00:41:29.104 --> 00:41:36.148]  But if we use their attack to wake people up, we can rally humanity and absolutely defeat them politically.
[00:41:36.148 --> 00:41:38.509]  And we're on the verge of that right now.
[00:41:38.509 --> 00:41:39.390]  They can feel it.
[00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:40.551]  They can see it.
[00:41:40.551 --> 00:41:50.336]  That's why you're seeing a bum rush to the finish line, pulling out every stop.
[00:41:50.336 --> 00:41:56.520]  And we can't be mad at these zombies that think the Loch Ness Monster was captured, or who don't know
[00:41:59.258 --> 00:42:00.519]  What the 4th of July is.
[00:42:00.519 --> 00:42:02.320]  Almost everyone he talked to, what's 4th of July?
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.262]  It's when we seceded and then defeated the South.
[00:42:05.262 --> 00:42:07.563]  It's when we beat Hitler.
[00:42:07.563 --> 00:42:09.104]  That's because that's not taught.
[00:42:09.104 --> 00:42:11.006]  That's not in the culture.
[00:42:11.006 --> 00:42:13.667]  That's not promoted.
[00:42:13.667 --> 00:42:23.193]  It's those ideas that then bore the fruit of more equality later.
[00:42:23.193 --> 00:42:26.195]  I want to go to this piece, then we'll get into the economic news.
[00:42:26.195 --> 00:42:26.636]  It's just
[00:42:28.072 --> 00:42:49.983]  The fact that we're getting police shot every week, sometimes every day, and we've got camera people getting killed, and reporters getting killed, and it's all basically racially motivated, and you've got to dig in the media to even find where it's being said.
[00:42:49.983 --> 00:42:54.705]  Sheriff blames anti-police rhetoric for killing a white police officer.
[00:42:54.705 --> 00:42:56.506]  Well, it's beyond anti-police.
[00:42:57.842 --> 00:43:11.507]  It's racist, it's being pushed, and this young man, who has obviously had problems, was manipulated into believing he was doing something valiant.
[00:43:11.507 --> 00:43:16.548]  And you've got folks saying, oh, we're just joking, talking about killing police.
[00:43:16.548 --> 00:43:17.749]  It's all just free speech.
[00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:33.861]  And now this gentleman will be sent to death row undoubtedly and spend 20 years waiting to be given lethal injection.
[00:43:33.861 --> 00:43:36.124]  Let's go to this Mark Dice piece.
[00:43:36.124 --> 00:43:41.810]  Then we're going to come back and get into central banks can't save the markets from a crash they shouldn't even try.
[00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:43.091]  Here is the Mark Dice piece.
[00:43:43.806 --> 00:43:52.630]  Probably saw on the news that this morning the hunters did capture what they have called the Loch Ness Monster, Nessie.
[00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.950]  Really?
[00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:58.452]  And we're just asking people if they think Nessie should be set free.
[00:43:58.452 --> 00:44:02.354]  Is that really fair to keep her in captivity like this?
[00:44:02.354 --> 00:44:04.395]  No, I think they should just let Nessie free.
[00:44:04.395 --> 00:44:08.237]  I mean, well, supposedly if they find her, that's messed up to keep an animal captured.
[00:44:08.237 --> 00:44:09.877]  You probably didn't check the news.
[00:44:09.877 --> 00:44:10.718]  No, yeah, no.
[00:44:12.159 --> 00:44:22.950]  It's, I mean there's occasionally the marine biologists will find these old animals that have thought to have been extinct and so they did capture the Loch Ness Monster, 17 foot long.
[00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:23.571]  Wow!
[00:44:23.571 --> 00:44:30.017]  And a lot of people are saying that it's really unfair to keep Nessie in captivity.
[00:44:30.017 --> 00:44:31.018]  These people will sign anything.
[00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:33.802]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:33.802 --> 00:44:38.486]  I think it's like, you know, animal rights, like, it's the same thing as humans, like, let them be free, you know?
[00:44:38.486 --> 00:44:48.333]  It's like, not right, as I said, that to keep, you know, a special being, like a special animal, like, keep and, like, show them off to people.
[00:44:48.333 --> 00:44:55.039]  It's like, no, let the animal be free and let, you know, other people enjoy the view and let, you know, let them be in nature, basically.
[00:44:55.039 --> 00:44:58.722]  What's your reaction to the discovery and the capture
[00:44:58.942 --> 00:45:10.749]  I'm actually surprised because I didn't even know it because I'm not from here so I never really watched the news and I'm just surprised that they found Loch Ness Monster but they should let her go free.
[00:45:10.749 --> 00:45:11.209]  Yeah.
[00:45:11.209 --> 00:45:12.330]  Alright, that's what we thought too.
[00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:13.291]  Thank you very much.
[00:45:13.291 --> 00:45:19.914]  Affirmed authentic today, a platysaurus dwelling deep within the waters of the loch.
[00:45:19.914 --> 00:45:20.295]  Really?
[00:45:20.295 --> 00:45:21.675]  Captured this morning.
[00:45:21.675 --> 00:45:22.116]  Really?
[00:45:22.116 --> 00:45:25.638]  Getting people's reactions to this historic find.
[00:45:25.638 --> 00:45:27.379]  They should turn it loose and leave it alone.
[00:45:28.952 --> 00:45:33.197]  Yeah, PETA is demanding that Nessie be set free immediately.
[00:45:33.197 --> 00:45:34.839]  You agree with their stance?
[00:45:34.839 --> 00:45:35.940]  Yes.
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:39.064]  I mean, it's a wild animal, just like any other animal.
[00:45:39.064 --> 00:45:42.208]  There's probably another one out there.
[00:45:42.208 --> 00:45:42.909]  His wife?
[00:45:42.909 --> 00:45:43.910]  Or her husband?
[00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:44.751]  Or whatever, yeah.
[00:45:45.865 --> 00:45:49.426]  Yeah, you know, it's kind of funny how man does things sometimes.
[00:45:49.426 --> 00:45:50.927]  We're just ruining everything.
[00:45:50.927 --> 00:45:53.888]  They see something they don't understand and what do they do with it?
[00:45:53.888 --> 00:45:55.548]  They grab it, drag it away.
[00:45:55.548 --> 00:45:56.949]  And put it in a zoo.
[00:45:56.949 --> 00:45:57.509]  Yeah.
[00:45:57.509 --> 00:46:00.530]  So we're gonna free Messi.
[00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:01.530]  You agree?
[00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:01.910]  I agree.
[00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:04.591]  Okay, thank you.
[00:46:04.591 --> 00:46:10.313]  On the news today that they actually... I'm sorry.
[00:46:10.313 --> 00:46:11.674]  I can't do this with a straight face.
[00:46:14.059 --> 00:46:22.045]  Well, we were going to try to tell you that they found the Loch Ness Monster to see what your reactions were, but I couldn't hold a straight face.
[00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:25.127]  So we're going to go talk to someone else.
[00:46:25.127 --> 00:46:29.670]  So a lot of people are calling for Nessie's return into the wild in Loch Ness.
[00:46:31.912 --> 00:46:37.014]  Do you think it's unfair to keep her in captivity after she was free all these years to roam?
[00:46:37.014 --> 00:46:37.635]  Absolutely.
[00:46:37.635 --> 00:46:42.137]  How SeaWorld deals with their orcas in general is disgusting.
[00:46:42.137 --> 00:46:43.717]  Watch blackfish.
[00:46:43.717 --> 00:46:44.538]  It's really eye-opening.
[00:46:44.538 --> 00:46:48.400]  Well, this is an extremely endangered species we're talking about here.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.100]  That's even worse.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.525]  The only one really known in existence.
[00:46:52.525 --> 00:46:55.809]  Is it fair to study her?
[00:46:55.809 --> 00:47:01.257]  Again, these people are actually smart compared to the usual ones because at least they have an argument for why.
[00:47:01.257 --> 00:47:04.703]  It's showing how gullible they are and how they'll sign on to anything.
[00:47:05.523 --> 00:47:09.587]  But they've got all these movies coming out about bullying of handicapped kids and stuff.
[00:47:09.587 --> 00:47:11.008]  And then I was researching them.
[00:47:11.008 --> 00:47:13.210]  There's three major movies coming out in the next year about this.
[00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:14.351]  Documentaries.
[00:47:14.351 --> 00:47:15.271]  Well, two of them are documentaries.
[00:47:15.271 --> 00:47:17.433]  One of them is a film based on a true story.
[00:47:17.433 --> 00:47:29.484]  And all of it at the end is financed by Soros groups to ban free speech and get hate speech bills passed, where if someone says what you said hurts their feelings, then you don't have free speech.
[00:47:31.783 --> 00:47:36.525]  And you notice the Feds have directed the cops to try to stop people filming in public as well.
[00:47:36.525 --> 00:47:38.025]  That violates the First Amendment.
[00:47:38.025 --> 00:47:42.047]  So there's this major war on legitimate free speech.
[00:47:42.047 --> 00:47:45.068]  And it's done with this whole politically correct backdrop.
[00:47:45.068 --> 00:47:47.249]  You can see the whole video at InfoWars.com.
[00:47:47.249 --> 00:47:50.210]  The Loch Ness Monster found and captured alive.
[00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:52.431]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[00:47:52.431 --> 00:47:55.352]  And again, we're just illustrating absurdity there.
[00:47:56.274 --> 00:47:57.655]  There's another report.
[00:47:57.655 --> 00:48:00.056]  Obama has declared open season on cops.
[00:48:00.056 --> 00:48:03.779]  University of Texas removes Jefferson Davis, Woodrow Wilson statues.
[00:48:03.779 --> 00:48:07.461]  Obama has renamed a mountain from a U.S.
[00:48:07.461 --> 00:48:09.463]  president to a native name.
[00:48:09.463 --> 00:48:14.126]  And again, it can sound nice on the surface, but that's what communist regimes do is start renaming everything.
[00:48:14.126 --> 00:48:16.687]  I mean, this is not good.
[00:48:16.687 --> 00:48:20.330]  It just sets the precedent that they control reality.
[00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:22.891]  Because the president gets to name things.
[00:48:22.891 --> 00:48:23.472]  He's God.
[00:48:25.293 --> 00:48:28.997]  Obama makes waves by renaming third largest peak.
[00:48:28.997 --> 00:48:35.083]  Bernie Sanders blames financial elite for economic crisis.
[00:48:35.083 --> 00:48:41.930]  Incorrectly claims climate change is a major issue for Americans.
[00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:46.174]  New York Times, a massive gun grab, only way to impact violent crime.
[00:48:46.174 --> 00:48:48.016]  They're calling for gun confiscation.
[00:48:50.009 --> 00:48:52.010]  There's another article by Ron Paul.
[00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:57.232]  Many blame the crash on China's recent currency devaluation.
[00:48:57.232 --> 00:49:00.834]  It is true that the crash was caused by a flawed monetary policy.
[00:49:00.834 --> 00:49:07.857]  However, the fault lies not with China's central bank, but with the U.S.
[00:49:07.857 --> 00:49:09.278]  Federal Reserve.
[00:49:09.278 --> 00:49:10.978]  And Paul's article breaks that down.
[00:49:10.978 --> 00:49:18.222]  We've had a bunch of experts on that concur with that in the last few weeks, that it's the Federal Reserve's
[00:49:19.258 --> 00:49:25.301]  Massive overprinting and issuance of dollars worldwide that's pushing these huge bubbles.
[00:49:25.301 --> 00:49:27.703]  We're gonna be breaking that down after the break.
[00:49:27.703 --> 00:49:37.148]  Briefly, the ultimate energy is not derived out of caffeine or some stimulant.
[00:49:37.148 --> 00:49:39.609]  It's derived from giving your body the building blocks it needs.
[00:49:39.609 --> 00:49:47.294]  The number one building block is organic methylcobalamin, vitamin B12, taken sublingually under the tongue,
[00:49:49.002 --> 00:49:50.883]  Absolutely powerful.
[00:49:50.883 --> 00:49:54.403]  It's had a huge effect for myself, my family, and others.
[00:49:54.403 --> 00:50:00.865]  Your purchase of Secret 12 helps fund the operation, so it's a win-win.

[00:50:28.495 --> 00:50:29.916]  Take it right under the tongue.
[00:50:29.916 --> 00:50:33.477]  B12 is known for its energy-boosting effects, and it really works.
[00:50:33.477 --> 00:50:35.497]  I'm going to tell you secret 12 every morning.

[00:54:17.817 --> 00:54:19.478]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:54:19.478 --> 00:54:20.098]  to 2 p.m.
[00:54:20.098 --> 00:54:23.240]  Central we are here live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:27.542]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:54:27.542 --> 00:54:32.925]  In some of the other news, Rand Paul promises to shut down NSA data center if he becomes president.
[00:54:32.925 --> 00:54:36.447]  Will convert it into a constitutional center to study the Fourth Amendment.
[00:54:36.447 --> 00:54:36.987]  Love that!
[00:54:39.639 --> 00:54:50.704]  Continuing here, a Saudi-led coalition airstrike kills 36 more in one day in Yemen, all of them civilians, that's Reuters.
[00:54:50.704 --> 00:54:56.686]  Federal appeals court, speaking of NSA, overturns blocking of NSA mass telephone spying.
[00:54:56.686 --> 00:55:02.548]  Law allowed the cell collection had been ruled unconstitutional.
[00:55:02.548 --> 00:55:03.969]  But they never stopped, they kept doing it.
[00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:08.632]  Donald Trump says U.S.
[00:55:08.632 --> 00:55:10.573]  treats illegals better than vets.
[00:55:10.573 --> 00:55:15.916]  Well, yeah, they don't put out Homeland Security reports saying veterans are the number one terror group.
[00:55:15.916 --> 00:55:22.320]  They don't give the vets, you know, free health care and then you get to have their baby for free.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:27.483]  The vet might get some quote free health care if you can jump through all the hoops, but their wife doesn't.
[00:55:27.483 --> 00:55:34.267]  Illegal immigrants in many cases, not in all cases, but many cases, are treated better than our veterans who are the greatest people we have.
[00:55:35.484 --> 00:55:37.485]  said Trump.
[00:55:37.485 --> 00:55:41.568]  And of course he was attacked for saying that.
[00:55:41.568 --> 00:55:44.890]  That's just some of the news on that front up at Infowars.com.
[00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:47.472]  Here is the big economic news.
[00:55:47.472 --> 00:55:52.556]  Central banks can't save the markets from a crash and they shouldn't even try.
[00:55:52.556 --> 00:55:59.220]  Alarming data from China was met with a soothing hint about monetary policy.
[00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:04.444]  But treasuries cannot keep pumping cheap credit into a series of asset bubbles.
[00:56:05.885 --> 00:56:12.931]  And interesting how this featured article at the London Guardian does not say who wrote it.
[00:56:12.931 --> 00:56:16.434]  So I guess that means it's from the editorial board of the Guardian.
[00:56:16.434 --> 00:56:22.519]  And you read this, it sounds like something Ron Paul would say, something I would say.
[00:56:22.519 --> 00:56:32.848]  As the common sense begins to basically permeate out that you're not going to be able to pump up bubbles with just fiat currency and fiat derivatives and fiat counterfeit instruments.
[00:56:32.848 --> 00:56:34.009]  Those won't feed you.
[00:56:35.697 --> 00:56:40.340]  Those won't actually power a society.
[00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:56.730]  But the globalists that are in control are actively trying to shut down the real jobs, the real farms, the real energy, the real manufacturing base, and only allow economic development in zones that are exempt from taxation, basically controlled by them.
[00:56:56.730 --> 00:56:58.971]  This is a takeover.
[00:56:58.971 --> 00:57:01.273]  This financial crisis is orchestrated.
[00:57:02.827 --> 00:57:14.991]  And as it intensifies, get ready for new calls for more too-big-to-fail infusions of taxpayer money, which gives the globalists first use of all the fiat money.
[00:57:14.991 --> 00:57:18.912]  Then they pass it on to us as it loses value.
[00:57:18.912 --> 00:57:27.395]  Like children clinging to their parents, stock market traders turned to their central banks last week as they sought protection from the frightening economic figures coming out of China.
[00:57:28.385 --> 00:57:36.691]  Surely, they asked, the central banks would ward off the approaching boogeyman, as they had so many times since the 2008 crash.
[00:57:36.691 --> 00:57:37.012]  The U.S.
[00:57:37.012 --> 00:57:40.474]  Federal Reserve came up with the goods.
[00:57:40.474 --> 00:57:49.181]  The President of the Federal Reserve of the Bank of New York hinted that the interest rates rise may be expected next month was likely to be delayed.
[00:57:49.181 --> 00:57:53.124]  They're going to keep the QE going, as we predicted.
[00:57:53.124 --> 00:57:57.487]  A signal that borrowing costs would remain at rock bottom was all it took.
[00:57:58.666 --> 00:58:02.788]  And again, they act like the Fed's doing this because we want it.
[00:58:02.788 --> 00:58:11.151]  They keep dangling it out there till we beg for it, so they can say it's our fault when this all happens.
[00:58:11.151 --> 00:58:14.633]  And the article goes on, it's excellent, it breaks it all down.
[00:58:14.633 --> 00:58:19.655]  Financial Times reports, Beijing's abandoned large-scale share purchases.
[00:58:19.655 --> 00:58:21.176]  So that means they're going to let their market go down.
[00:58:24.353 --> 00:58:29.217]  And disrupting major ad revenue online, Apple's ad blockers rile publishers.
[00:58:29.217 --> 00:58:32.479]  It blocks all the ads on any Apple device.
[00:58:32.479 --> 00:58:34.401]  Will be, except Apple ads.
[00:58:34.401 --> 00:58:37.423]  By the way, that clearly is a monopoly.
[00:58:37.423 --> 00:58:40.985]  Where are the trust busters to say nobody else's ads?
[00:58:40.985 --> 00:58:44.568]  You put it on your website and they block it on their systems.
[00:58:44.568 --> 00:58:46.249]  So you can only see their ads.
[00:58:46.249 --> 00:58:48.371]  That is clearly, clearly a trust.
[00:58:49.131 --> 00:58:52.654]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:58:52.654 --> 00:59:00.879]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:00.879 --> 00:59:06.323]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:59:06.323 --> 00:59:08.825]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:08.825 --> 00:59:10.946]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:59:51.235 --> 00:59:53.825]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.222 --> 01:00:06.523]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.523 --> 01:00:08.284]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.284 --> 01:00:10.045]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.045 --> 01:00:11.646]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.646 --> 01:00:13.187]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.187 --> 01:00:17.370]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:21.433]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:42.021]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are here broadcasting worldwide.
[01:00:42.021 --> 01:00:45.682]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Monday edition.
[01:00:45.682 --> 01:00:46.963]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:00:46.963 --> 01:00:55.466]  We have the documentary filmmaker, we're going to have the trailer for you as well, for a film I saw about a month ago here in Austin, Texas.
[01:00:55.466 --> 01:01:00.287]  It's won a bunch of awards and the film is Cartel Land.
[01:01:00.287 --> 01:01:02.848]  Just to show you what the drug war has done in Mexico,
[01:01:05.086 --> 01:01:10.389]  As really a warning to where this society and this country is going as well.
[01:01:10.389 --> 01:01:19.594]  As the economy breaks down and as illicit black market systems are the only place people can make money.
[01:01:19.594 --> 01:01:26.857]  You add a bunch of guns in the mix that only criminals have, the general public doesn't have it.
[01:01:26.857 --> 01:01:31.120]  You have corrupt police forces that are bought and paid for by the cartels and the CIA.
[01:01:32.566 --> 01:01:35.807]  It is a disastrous, disastrous mix.
[01:01:35.807 --> 01:01:48.313]  So we have the director of Cartel Land joining us coming up, and that's Matthew Heinemann, CartelLandMovie.com.
[01:01:48.313 --> 01:01:53.915]  But a very powerful film, very, very disturbing as well.
[01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:58.114]  So that's coming up in the next segment.
[01:01:58.114 --> 01:02:13.361]  And then we're going to have Vani Hari, the food babe, on with us, covering health issues, food issues, activism, because the movement to have GMO labeling, the movement to not buy GMO processed garbage, is destroying the globalists right now.
[01:02:13.361 --> 01:02:17.583]  It's one of the main areas, if not the main area, that we're having success.
[01:02:17.583 --> 01:02:19.663]  And she's right at the tip of the spear.
[01:02:19.663 --> 01:02:20.804]  And it's really a testament
[01:02:22.298 --> 01:02:24.339]  To what voting with our dollars does.
[01:02:24.339 --> 01:02:28.822]  That's why the globalists are in a race to sew everything up.
[01:02:28.822 --> 01:02:49.376]  Because if the left and the right ever wake up to the fact that we're in a controlled paradigm, if we ever wake up to the fact that both parties are controlled, if we ever wake up to the fact that the same people that run the white supremacist groups run the liberal and socialist and communist and Jewish groups and other organizations, and that it's a controlled dialectic, it's game over.
[01:02:51.348 --> 01:03:05.837]  And that's what I'm here to try to get people to do is to think outside the box and to really see and understand the overall manipulation that is taking place and unfolding.
[01:03:05.837 --> 01:03:09.019]  We will do the fourth hour, the entire fourth hour today.
[01:03:09.019 --> 01:03:14.443]  Again, I did the fourth hour for about five years.
[01:03:14.443 --> 01:03:18.685]  For the first 12 years or so, I did three hours every day, 11 a.m.
[01:03:18.685 --> 01:03:18.845]  to 2 p.m.
[01:03:21.178 --> 01:03:24.819]  And for about five years, I did a fourth hour.
[01:03:24.819 --> 01:03:31.042]  But launching the Nightly News and my other administrative duties, it was just too exhausting.
[01:03:31.042 --> 01:03:38.124]  But a lot of stations kept carrying the fourth hour, and I thought, you know, we're getting five hours a day on satellite for TV.
[01:03:38.124 --> 01:03:40.665]  Four hours during the day, an hour at night for the Nightly News.
[01:03:40.665 --> 01:03:42.225]  We just set all that up.
[01:03:42.225 --> 01:03:49.028]  Why not just have the fourth hour and truly get my reporters, who are smart folks,
[01:03:50.865 --> 01:03:54.788]  Out of the box of taping shows.
[01:03:54.788 --> 01:03:56.609]  We do the Nightly News live sometimes.
[01:03:56.609 --> 01:03:59.771]  They get really good after, say, a five-hour marathon Nightly News.
[01:03:59.771 --> 01:04:03.694]  We do that during elections and things, sometimes a ten-hour long.
[01:04:03.694 --> 01:04:10.218]  So we'll just start throwing everybody in the deep end of the pool every weekday in the fourth hour.
[01:04:10.218 --> 01:04:15.542]  Some days I'll be there, some days I'll host the whole hour and have a special guest, but a lot of days, most days,
[01:04:17.148 --> 01:04:25.715]  It will be Leon McAdoo, Jakari Jackson, Darren McBreen, David Knight, and the rest of the crew.
[01:04:25.715 --> 01:04:27.376]  We'll have some of the writers in here.
[01:04:27.376 --> 01:04:29.357]  We'll have guests.
[01:04:29.357 --> 01:04:31.039]  Sometimes we'll have activist guests in.
[01:04:31.039 --> 01:04:36.503]  Sometimes we'll randomly get some folks off the street, bring them in here, see what they think about what's going on.
[01:04:36.503 --> 01:04:39.725]  We'll premiere a lot of stuff in the fourth hour as well.
[01:04:39.725 --> 01:04:41.526]  It's going to become probably the best hour.
[01:04:43.255 --> 01:04:49.978]  Of TV slash radio that we do every day to the fourth hours on satellite, TV and radio.
[01:04:49.978 --> 01:04:50.958]  It's back.
[01:04:50.958 --> 01:04:55.540]  Find showtimes, listings, the tales and info.org.com forward slash show.
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:56.100]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:59.198 --> 01:05:01.840]  Here's a story for all you supporters of the war on drugs.
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:07.085]  Cocaine production plummets after DEA kicked out of Bolivia from the website TheAntimedia.org.
[01:05:07.085 --> 01:05:15.112]  According to data released by the United Nations, cocaine production in that country declined by 11% in the past year, making the fourth year in a row of steady decrease.
[01:05:15.112 --> 01:05:17.815]  It was just seven years ago that the DEA was kicked out of Bolivia.
[01:05:18.075 --> 01:05:20.637]  And only three years after that, progress was finally made.
[01:05:20.637 --> 01:05:27.643]  The strategy employed by the Bolivian government may surprise many prohibitionists because it did not involve strong-arm police state tactics.
[01:05:27.643 --> 01:05:32.648]  Instead, they worked to find alternative crops for farmers to grow that would actually make them more money.
[01:05:32.648 --> 01:05:34.129]  Bolivia has adopted a policy
[01:05:34.289 --> 01:05:42.477]  Where coca cultivation is allowed in traditional areas alongside alternative development and others, said Antonio DeLeo from the UN Office of Drugs and Crime.
[01:05:42.477 --> 01:05:42.957]  The U.S.
[01:05:42.957 --> 01:05:46.641]  is still involved in Afghanistan and look at the heroin production coming out of that area.
[01:05:46.641 --> 01:05:47.842]  It has skyrocketed.
[01:05:47.842 --> 01:05:50.344]  Is the United States really against the war on drugs?
[01:05:50.344 --> 01:05:52.326]  Or is it just against the people who use them?
[01:05:52.326 --> 01:05:55.749]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:05:55.749 --> 01:05:58.031]  Subscribe to the Alex Jones Channel for more reports.
[01:05:59.056 --> 01:06:06.258]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:20.861]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com has taken colloidal silver to the next level using a cutting-edge technique
[01:06:21.001 --> 01:06:23.302]  That is free of toxic artificial additives.
[01:06:23.302 --> 01:06:31.123]  Infowarslife.com developed Silver Bullet by closely working with one of the top silver manufacturing labs in the United States.
[01:06:31.123 --> 01:06:34.804]  We set out to bring you the very best at the lowest price.

[01:06:47.247 --> 01:06:48.287]  Exclusively available
[01:06:48.487 --> 01:07:02.876]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[01:07:02.876 --> 01:07:16.265]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world, so prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[01:07:16.425 --> 01:07:25.210]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[01:07:25.210 --> 01:07:27.051]  This is the good halogen.
[01:07:27.051 --> 01:07:30.113]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[01:07:30.113 --> 01:07:42.120]  Now we at Infowarslife.com are bringing you the only source of clean, pure, 99.99 Ultra Pure Deep Earth Crystals from more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.401]  Watch the informational videos

[01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:14.496]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America, and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[01:08:14.496 --> 01:08:18.520]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.582]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:08:20.582 --> 01:08:22.783]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:08:22.783 --> 01:08:24.785]  John has a long mustache.
[01:08:24.785 --> 01:08:26.827]  John has a long mustache.
[01:08:26.827 --> 01:08:29.689]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans, another day closer to victory.
[01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:33.813]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[01:08:39.691 --> 01:08:41.573]  But they took a lot of people away.
[01:08:41.573 --> 01:08:43.714]  People that they thought were gonna make trouble for them.
[01:08:43.714 --> 01:08:46.917]  People that had guns and things they wanted, they just took them away.
[01:08:46.917 --> 01:08:48.298]  Where?
[01:08:48.298 --> 01:08:50.399]  Re-education camps, that's what they call it.
[01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:58.626]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, or recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:08:58.626 --> 01:09:02.509]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[01:09:07.649 --> 01:09:10.031]  I'm a solid citizen.
[01:09:10.031 --> 01:09:11.432]  I refuse to recognize you guys.
[01:09:22.262 --> 01:09:24.083]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[01:09:24.083 --> 01:09:25.123]  would you see that happening?
[01:09:25.123 --> 01:09:29.906]  I mean we've got a lot of constitutionless and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[01:09:29.906 --> 01:09:39.710]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[01:09:39.710 --> 01:09:45.713]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States.
[01:09:45.713 --> 01:09:50.275]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community
[01:09:57.045 --> 01:09:59.607]  That's what we're doing here, and let's not kid about it.
[01:09:59.607 --> 01:10:04.629]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[01:10:04.629 --> 01:10:07.851]  Put your gun down, really?
[01:10:07.851 --> 01:10:12.834]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:14.695]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:10:14.695 --> 01:10:19.778]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[01:10:19.778 --> 01:10:23.701]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:10:34.059 --> 01:10:45.176]  Red Dawn came out in the early 1980s, and it parallels historically what's happened to other countries that have been infiltrated, that have been taken over.
[01:10:45.176 --> 01:10:48.761]  In this case, by a communist invasion from the South.
[01:10:48.761 --> 01:10:49.642]  And of course, it's fiction.
[01:10:50.623 --> 01:10:53.665]  But many times, fiction parallels reality.
[01:10:53.665 --> 01:10:58.288]  We have Central and South America in massive decline, collapsing.
[01:10:58.288 --> 01:11:01.631]  Mexico's been a failed state for about seven, eight years.
[01:11:01.631 --> 01:11:17.822]  It's my view that the phony drug war, along with poverty and corruption of the government and the military, I've had a lot of professors on the concur, is what has allowed Mexico to become a failed state with more than 100,000 dead that we know of in the last decade.
[01:11:18.854 --> 01:11:28.603]  That violence is now accelerating upwards of a third of Arizona has signs saying do not enter these areas controlled by cartels.
[01:11:28.603 --> 01:11:32.546]  Our government can't and won't stop what's happening.
[01:11:32.546 --> 01:11:37.331]  The CIA has been caught working with the cartels, shipping a lot of the drugs in.
[01:11:38.595 --> 01:11:48.807]  Now about a month ago, I went to the local theater, the local art house theater, the Arbor, in North Austin, to see a film, Cartel Land.
[01:11:48.807 --> 01:11:50.849]  CartelLandMovie.com.
[01:11:50.849 --> 01:11:56.896]  And I had followed the vigilantes in Mexico getting arms and defending themselves.
[01:11:56.896 --> 01:11:57.797]  I had followed
[01:11:58.678 --> 01:12:12.081]  The cartel and the government's response, but to see the footage and the shootouts and the deaths and the safe houses and the police cooking the drugs and all of it added multiple dimensions to it.
[01:12:13.055 --> 01:12:17.858]  I've got to say, it's one of the most powerful documentaries I've ever seen.
[01:12:17.858 --> 01:12:20.479]  Matthew Heineman joins us to the bottom of the hour.
[01:12:20.479 --> 01:12:24.802]  I'm going to play the trailer for Cartel Land movie coming up here in a few minutes.
[01:12:24.802 --> 01:12:26.483]  And no, I'm not invested in it.
[01:12:26.483 --> 01:12:27.584]  No, I'm not selling it.
[01:12:27.584 --> 01:12:31.326]  I mean, I'm promoting it because you want to see what the drug war is.
[01:12:31.326 --> 01:12:32.607]  This is it.
[01:12:32.607 --> 01:12:34.948]  And it was so fair.
[01:12:34.948 --> 01:12:41.472]  He didn't show the paramilitary folks on the Arizona side as just hillbilly racist.
[01:12:42.469 --> 01:12:44.958]  He showed them as human beings.
[01:12:44.958 --> 01:12:48.250]  And there's a little undercurrent of some racial stuff, because that's honest.
[01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:48.692]  That's there.
[01:12:50.006 --> 01:12:59.991]  Basically, he found what I found going to Arizona, going to South Texas, going over to Mexico, my reporter's going over to Mexico, but we've done nothing compared to what he did.
[01:12:59.991 --> 01:13:02.552]  I mean, you talk about dangerous.
[01:13:02.552 --> 01:13:10.776]  I've seen a lot of combat footage that troops have sent back that have been in combat, two, three, four tours, and they didn't see this much action.
[01:13:10.776 --> 01:13:18.340]  So this guy deserves a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star for bravery if journalism issued such awards.
[01:13:19.704 --> 01:13:22.987]  Matthew Heinemann, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:13:22.987 --> 01:13:26.391]  All I can say is congratulations on what you produced.
[01:13:26.391 --> 01:13:27.492]  It's really amazing.
[01:13:27.492 --> 01:13:34.319]  Tell us about how you made Part 1 and Part 2, and those two parts, and just your view on the drug war and where all this is going.
[01:13:36.274 --> 01:13:37.895]  Yeah, well, thanks for having me on.
[01:13:37.895 --> 01:13:39.096]  I really appreciate it.
[01:13:39.096 --> 01:13:48.482]  I think with Cartel Land, I really wanted to take this issue of narco-violence and take it out of the headlines and put myself right into the middle of the action.
[01:13:48.482 --> 01:13:54.866]  There's been a lot of glorification of drug violence in TV shows and movies.
[01:13:55.786 --> 01:14:09.173]  And, you know, I really wanted to take an apolitical look and see how this narco-violence was affecting everyday people, and then the response of everyday people rising up to fight back, and then, you know, what happens when they do so.
[01:14:09.173 --> 01:14:20.719]  And so, you know, I was embedded with these two different groups, one in Arizona, one in Mexico, over the course of a year, and, you know, embarked on this journey that I never could have imagined or predicted.
[01:14:24.059 --> 01:14:29.872]  Continue to break down this saga or this quest.
[01:14:29.872 --> 01:14:30.694]  Yeah, I mean, I think...
[01:14:34.197 --> 01:14:39.902]  It's really, really complicated, this issue of the drug wars.
[01:14:39.902 --> 01:14:47.428]  My goal was not to do a big policy film or be the definitive film on the drug wars.
[01:14:47.428 --> 01:14:55.616]  My goal was to tell a human story through these characters, through these citizens who have taken the law into their own hands to fight for what they believe in.
[01:14:57.357 --> 01:15:01.699]  At the heart of this film are these two men, Tim Naylor Foley on the U.S.
[01:15:01.699 --> 01:15:11.103]  side and El Doctor, a small-time physician in the state of Michoacán in Mexico, who are leading these two different vigilante groups.
[01:15:11.103 --> 01:15:12.764]  They're both 55-year-old men.
[01:15:12.764 --> 01:15:15.125]  They both believe that the government has failed them.
[01:15:16.865 --> 01:15:17.406]  We're good to go.
[01:15:40.985 --> 01:15:44.712]  Whereas in Arizona, we're not seeing that same type of violence.
[01:15:44.712 --> 01:15:51.704]  And the vigilante fight is a little bit more a fear that these Mexican drug wars will seep its way across our borders.
[01:15:54.813 --> 01:16:00.640]  But it is the fear and the concern and the preparation that stops it from completely taking over.
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:06.386]  We have had homes burned down, severed heads, a lot of drug war crime in the Southwest.
[01:16:06.386 --> 01:16:12.453]  I don't think it's anywhere near as bad as Mexico, I agree with you, but I think that's what's so powerful about your film.
[01:16:13.374 --> 01:16:35.593]  And so refreshing is that you don't give any commentary, you show what they're really saying, and you get the humanness of all the different factions in Mexico, the factions over here, and it's just nauseating, but at the same time exhilarating to actually be like a fly on the wall.
[01:16:35.593 --> 01:16:38.716]  I mean, all I can say is just an amazing job.
[01:16:40.077 --> 01:16:40.717]  Thank you so much.
[01:16:40.717 --> 01:16:47.779]  I mean, you know, I think to me one of the big problems in America, one of the biggest problems in America, is how polarized media has become.
[01:16:47.779 --> 01:16:56.681]  How, you know, people on all sides of the political spectrum are fed information that they don't necessarily trust.
[01:16:56.681 --> 01:16:59.002]  And, you know, that's why, you know, I really...
[01:17:00.262 --> 01:17:04.745]  You know, I have my own personal beliefs, my own political beliefs, but that's not, that's not important.
[01:17:04.745 --> 01:17:13.791]  You know, I think what's important is to tell a truthful and honest story, um, and to let the people, uh, with whom I spent time tell the story themselves.
[01:17:13.791 --> 01:17:14.792]  And that's what I tried to do.
[01:17:14.792 --> 01:17:19.836]  You know, I, I, I think, you know, my opinion, my views are, are not important.
[01:17:19.836 --> 01:17:22.677]  What's important is, is to show what's happening.
[01:17:22.677 --> 01:17:27.501]  And I think that's the beauty of documentary film, is to open people's eyes to a world that they've never seen before.
[01:17:29.099 --> 01:17:34.704]  I don't want to give the film away, but I have a personal question.
[01:17:34.704 --> 01:17:53.502]  Obviously you've got one of the founders of the vigilante movement, and he comes off as a really good guy, and then later you discover that he's not completely perfect, but then I looked over to my friends that were with me and I said, and I don't want to give it away, spoiler alert, but he looks over to his
[01:17:55.725 --> 01:18:11.705]  Well, I don't want to give it away, but what I'm getting at, I looked over and I said, I bet he's already basically broken up with his wife, but then you never really find out if he broke up with her before or after or if he's cheating on his wife right in front of the cameras.
[01:18:14.341 --> 01:18:17.622]  If you don't mind, I'd prefer not to try to get into it too much.
[01:18:17.622 --> 01:18:32.424]  I think one of the beauties of the film is that the film unravels in a way that you can't really necessarily script or imagine, and so I'd like to let the viewers... Sure, but that's a pretty good teaser I just gave you, isn't it?
[01:18:32.424 --> 01:18:34.505]  Hey, I'll take what I can get.
[01:18:34.505 --> 01:18:36.565]  Let's talk about how the film's doing.
[01:18:36.565 --> 01:18:37.765]  I mean, I haven't really followed that.
[01:18:37.765 --> 01:18:39.325]  I know it won a bunch of awards.
[01:18:39.325 --> 01:18:42.646]  Tell us about the awards it won, and then where folks can find it.
[01:18:43.359 --> 01:18:44.340]  Sure.
[01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:47.421]  So the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.
[01:18:47.421 --> 01:18:57.487]  I was very lucky to win the Best Director Award and Best Cinematography Award at the Sundance Film Festival.
[01:18:57.487 --> 01:19:06.793]  It's played at festivals all across the world, and then it opened in movie theaters in early July, playing theaters all across the United States.
[01:19:07.313 --> 01:19:10.775]  It's still playing in some theaters, um, in different places.
[01:19:10.775 --> 01:19:19.439]  Um, and, you know, I think the best way to find out information about the film is our website, cartellandmovie.com, or our Facebook page, facebook.com slash cartelland.
[01:19:19.439 --> 01:19:25.962]  Uh, in early October, it will be out, uh, on iTunes and, and Video On Demand.
[01:19:25.962 --> 01:19:29.183]  Um, and so people will be able to get it online.
[01:19:29.183 --> 01:19:31.384]  And then it'll eventually be on A&E, uh, in 2016.
[01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:44.997]  Well, all I can say is, for people that haven't seen it, I don't normally get filmmakers on and gush over it, especially, you know, stuff that's more mainstream, but this is not mainstream.
[01:19:44.997 --> 01:19:49.800]  Had you ever made a film or been involved in something this dangerous before?
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.321]  I'm not, you know, I'm not a war reporter.
[01:19:51.321 --> 01:19:54.043]  I've never ever been in any situations like this before.
[01:19:54.043 --> 01:19:55.003]  Well, you are now.
[01:19:55.003 --> 01:19:59.046]  I mean, you're a seasoned war reporter spending a year in what I saw.
[01:19:59.046 --> 01:20:02.208]  Torture bases, getting shot at, stuff blowing up.
[01:20:02.208 --> 01:20:03.469]  I mean, man, I tell you.
[01:20:04.949 --> 01:20:11.792]  Yeah, you know, it was absolutely terrifying, and I don't think I was necessarily prepared for what I was going to see, you know.
[01:20:11.792 --> 01:20:23.198]  Through the process of making this film, I found myself in shootouts between the vigilantes and the cartel, you know, torture chambers, meth labs, places I never could have imagined being in.
[01:20:23.198 --> 01:20:31.842]  And, you know, at first, I think, you know, one of the interesting things about the film is, you know, at first it seemed like a very simple story, a very simple story of
[01:20:33.936 --> 01:20:38.259]  You know, everyday citizens rising up to fight back against an evil cartel.
[01:20:38.259 --> 01:20:43.963]  And over time, the lines between good and evil became ever more blurry.
[01:20:43.963 --> 01:20:44.724]  That's right.
[01:20:44.724 --> 01:20:47.546]  It shows how the corruption takes place.
[01:20:47.546 --> 01:20:57.493]  Yeah, and it shows the corruption between the cartels, the government, and ultimately the vigilantes, without giving too much away.
[01:20:57.493 --> 01:21:03.218]  And I think that's what's so scary, especially in Mexico, is that
[01:21:04.502 --> 01:21:07.203]  No, there's an absolute lack of rule of law.
[01:21:07.203 --> 01:21:12.344]  What we see is the failure of government institutions.
[01:21:12.344 --> 01:21:21.287]  I think one of the saddest things for me is to see the suffering of everyday people, the suffering of everyday citizens living in this lawless world.
[01:21:23.274 --> 01:21:24.955]  You know, and the fear.
[01:21:24.955 --> 01:21:29.658]  There's a young woman in the beginning of the film.
[01:21:29.658 --> 01:21:33.101]  It's a really dramatic scene in which the auto defenses take over town.
[01:21:33.101 --> 01:21:36.103]  The military comes in and disarms them.
[01:21:36.103 --> 01:21:39.926]  And then the citizens come and surround the army.
[01:21:40.966 --> 01:21:44.770]  Uh, and to defend the auto defenses, to defend the vigilantes.
[01:21:44.770 --> 01:21:48.313]  There's a young woman who's screaming, uh, face to face with the army.
[01:21:48.313 --> 01:21:53.838]  And we later find out that she, um, both of her parents were killed by the cartel.
[01:21:53.838 --> 01:21:56.260]  Her brothers were killed by the cartel.
[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:59.443]  And she was too scared to go to the police.
[01:21:59.443 --> 01:22:03.506]  She was too scared that the police either were the cartel or were being paid by the cartel.
[01:22:04.907 --> 01:22:07.268]  Or we're directly working with the cartel.
[01:22:07.268 --> 01:22:12.110]  And so, you know, that's the world in which this movie begins.
[01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:16.371]  And it's a very scary world.
[01:22:16.371 --> 01:22:25.674]  Expanding on that, I know when my reporters have gone into Mexico and covered drug houses and things like that, the FBI shows up, wants to debrief them afterwards.
[01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:27.415]  Have you ever been approached by the FBI, the CIA?
[01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:35.205]  Um, not, not, not, not directly, uh, as of yet.
[01:22:35.205 --> 01:22:38.807]  Well, I'm surprised you haven't.
[01:22:38.807 --> 01:22:41.149]  I mean, you've seen a lot of stuff nobody else has seen.
[01:22:41.149 --> 01:22:43.231]  How, how did you get them to trust you so much?
[01:22:43.231 --> 01:22:46.674]  I mean, they bring you into auto defense torture centers.
[01:22:46.674 --> 01:22:50.216]  They, I mean, the police cook methamphetamine in front of you.
[01:22:50.216 --> 01:22:55.501]  How did you get them to trust you so much?
[01:22:55.501 --> 01:22:56.361]  I think, you know, one of,
[01:22:57.455 --> 01:23:00.041]  With a film like this, you know, the biggest thing is access.
[01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:04.030]  And, you know, I really didn't want to tell a story through experts or talking heads or...
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:11.121]  You know, government officials, I want to tell the story through the eyes of the vigilantes themselves.
[01:23:11.121 --> 01:23:15.122]  And in terms of getting them to trust me, I think there's a variety of factors.
[01:23:15.122 --> 01:23:19.483]  I think, for one, being honest and truthful with your intentions.
[01:23:19.483 --> 01:23:23.684]  You know, I wasn't trying to, as I said earlier, I wasn't trying to bring an agenda.
[01:23:23.684 --> 01:23:30.506]  I was very clear with them that I wanted to let them tell the story and to follow the journey as it naturally happened.
[01:23:30.506 --> 01:23:34.327]  A filmmaker mentor of mine once said that
[01:23:34.887 --> 01:23:38.068]  If you end up with a story that you started with and you weren't listening along the way.
[01:23:38.068 --> 01:23:41.249]  And I think that's good advice for life.
[01:23:41.249 --> 01:23:43.029]  And I think it's good advice for filmmaking.
[01:23:43.029 --> 01:23:43.949]  Sure.
[01:23:43.949 --> 01:23:46.310]  Being open to the story changing.
[01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:50.031]  But you know, another thing that I think really helped was they were risking their lives.
[01:23:50.031 --> 01:23:52.592]  They were dying, fighting for this cause.
[01:23:52.592 --> 01:23:55.412]  And I was right alongside them to do so.
[01:23:55.412 --> 01:23:57.253]  Excuse me, right alongside them filming them.
[01:23:58.493 --> 01:24:00.554]  I think that's how you were able to do it, correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:24:00.554 --> 01:24:12.657]  You were in at the beginning of the rebellion, of the peasant uprising, against the corrupt police, against the cartels, the battles, the defeats, when they were pure, and then you're with them for over a year as things start to degenerate.
[01:24:12.657 --> 01:24:15.178]  That's why you were already in, because you were in from the start.
[01:24:16.351 --> 01:24:21.995]  Yeah, I wasn't in from the absolute beginning, but I was there, you know, early on.
[01:24:21.995 --> 01:24:35.024]  And I think, yeah, as I said, you know, they're risking their lives and by me being alongside them, there's a level of respect that I had with them that, you know, I was willing to risk my life and the life of my crew to tell this story.
[01:24:35.024 --> 01:24:38.846]  And so I think that's what's so upsetting is you see how brave the Mexican people are.
[01:24:38.846 --> 01:24:41.908]  They're smart, they're funny, and they have a failed culture.
[01:24:41.908 --> 01:24:44.790]  And I look at America, on average, we're so soft.
[01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:45.791]  I don't care what color we are.
[01:24:46.431 --> 01:24:49.253]  I mean, if we start collapsing like that, we're going to be in deep trouble.
[01:24:49.253 --> 01:24:51.914]  And, you know, the veneer of civilization is very thin.
[01:24:51.914 --> 01:24:57.457]  If the drug war continues, in my view, and our society continues to break down, I think we could become like Mexico.
[01:24:57.457 --> 01:25:00.398]  No, no.
[01:25:00.398 --> 01:25:02.019]  I mean, you know, let's hope not.
[01:25:02.019 --> 01:25:04.961]  And, you know, I'm an eternal optimist.
[01:25:04.961 --> 01:25:06.982]  You know, I believe in the goodness of humanity.
[01:25:06.982 --> 01:25:13.605]  And, you know, I want to believe that, you know, one day this corruption and this violence in Mexico will stop.
[01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:16.430]  You know, we think about 9-11.
[01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:19.511]  I don't have the exact numbers.
[01:25:19.511 --> 01:25:22.171]  I think it was roughly 3,500, 4,000 people that were killed.
[01:25:22.171 --> 01:25:26.732]  And look how much that changed the course of America.
[01:25:26.732 --> 01:25:32.473]  You know, here in Mexico, we have almost 100,000 people killed.
[01:25:32.473 --> 01:25:36.774]  I mean, it's a war that's happening in the country just south of us.
[01:25:36.774 --> 01:25:41.615]  And I really hope that through the cartel end, I can open people's eyes to that war.
[01:25:43.057 --> 01:25:43.457]  Absolutely.
[01:25:43.457 --> 01:25:44.740]  I want to talk about your next project.
[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:45.481]  Then we're going to go to break.
[01:25:45.481 --> 01:25:45.962]  You've got to leave.
[01:25:45.962 --> 01:25:49.048]  I'm going to come back and actually play the trailer and have some final comments.
[01:25:49.048 --> 01:25:51.694]  Again, we have the director of Cartel Land on with us right now.
[01:25:52.577 --> 01:25:56.239]  But you didn't set out to make something libertarian based.
[01:25:56.239 --> 01:25:58.500]  I understand that it's not political.
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:03.342]  You don't demonize the paramilitary militia that's on the border.
[01:26:03.342 --> 01:26:04.742]  There's some good groups, some bad groups.
[01:26:04.742 --> 01:26:05.223]  I've been there.
[01:26:05.223 --> 01:26:06.103]  I've looked at it.
[01:26:06.103 --> 01:26:11.786]  Seems like you chose a group from about what I've seen that really represents what these paramilitaries are really like.
[01:26:11.786 --> 01:26:13.046]  The ones I know.
[01:26:13.046 --> 01:26:14.367]  There's a few bad groups out there.
[01:26:15.047 --> 01:26:15.107]  Um...
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:46.843]  Again, I don't believe, I don't know what your political background is.
[01:26:46.843 --> 01:26:50.686]  I probably should have done more research before coming on the show.
[01:26:50.686 --> 01:26:51.987]  But I don't think it frankly matters.
[01:26:51.987 --> 01:26:53.608]  I don't think it matters what my background is.
[01:26:53.608 --> 01:26:59.392]  I think as a journalist, as a filmmaker, your job is to tell a truthful story.
[01:26:59.972 --> 01:27:04.634]  Yeah, you did that, and that's so rare to then see that it's going to be on mainstream TV.
[01:27:04.634 --> 01:27:15.378]  You know, Ian, and various people I respect it, is I think, you know, there's no judgment that's brought into this, you know, and I wish the world could work more often.
[01:27:15.378 --> 01:27:19.279]  Sure, but nobody seeing this is going to want us to have an open border with Mexico, I can tell you right now.
[01:27:20.646 --> 01:27:21.927]  I mean, I'm a libertarian.
[01:27:21.927 --> 01:27:27.271]  I want open borders if we didn't have all this high welfare to draw in people that are just gonna be deadbeats.
[01:27:27.271 --> 01:27:36.899]  So, I mean, all I'm saying is you put out a really truthful film from my research, and I just think that's really rare, and so kudos to Sundance, kudos to A&E, kudos to everybody.
[01:27:36.899 --> 01:27:42.183]  I mean, if mainstream TV starts going this direction, they'll have ratings again, because people just want the truth.
[01:27:42.183 --> 01:27:47.507]  Yeah, you know, and I think, you know, regardless of politics, I think that
[01:27:49.296 --> 01:27:55.199]  I wish media, and I hope with Cartel Land, you know, what are you doing if you're preaching to the choir?
[01:27:55.199 --> 01:27:58.160]  What are you doing if you just attract, you know, one sector of America?
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:02.462]  I think with media and journalism and film, you know, you should be attracting all sides.
[01:28:02.462 --> 01:28:09.145]  And I think if we're all talking together rather than all, you know, siloed and talking in part, then maybe some good can happen.
[01:28:09.145 --> 01:28:16.228]  And I think that's, you know, that was my goal with this film, is that hopefully, you know, we can attract an audience.
[01:28:19.271 --> 01:28:20.752]  You're Skype's breaking up a little bit.
[01:28:20.752 --> 01:28:22.712]  We're going to let it re-stabilize for a moment again.
[01:28:22.712 --> 01:28:28.393]  We have the director of Cartel Land, CartelLandMovie.com, Matthew Heinemann.
[01:28:28.393 --> 01:28:37.295]  In closing, sir, if your Skype's back, any other parts of the film that we didn't get to see and what are you working on next?
[01:28:37.295 --> 01:28:38.436]  Can you hear me now?
[01:28:38.436 --> 01:28:39.076]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[01:28:39.076 --> 01:28:39.956]  What are you working on next?
[01:28:41.215 --> 01:28:44.116]  I'm developing a few different films.
[01:28:44.116 --> 01:28:46.956]  I might make another film in this space.
[01:28:46.956 --> 01:28:48.597]  To be honest, I'm not totally sure.
[01:28:48.597 --> 01:28:51.517]  So we'll see.
[01:28:51.517 --> 01:28:53.858]  I'm excited to keep making films.
[01:28:53.858 --> 01:28:56.318]  I feel very lucky and honored to be able to do that.
[01:28:56.318 --> 01:29:01.560]  And hopefully I'll make another one very soon.
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:05.441]  Have you caught the bug of wartime journalism?
[01:29:05.441 --> 01:29:06.261]  I don't know if I have.
[01:29:08.524 --> 01:29:10.548]  I guess a little bit of me has, probably.
[01:29:10.548 --> 01:29:15.978]  Every time I see the film, I get a little bit of the adrenaline rush.
[01:29:17.025 --> 01:29:18.326]  You know, I love my family.
[01:29:18.326 --> 01:29:19.246]  I love my girlfriend.
[01:29:19.246 --> 01:29:22.127]  You know, I don't know if I want to keep putting myself at risk.
[01:29:22.127 --> 01:29:22.807]  So, we'll see.
[01:29:22.807 --> 01:29:23.648]  You know?
[01:29:23.648 --> 01:29:29.890]  I was about to say, you can get out while the getting's good and count your lucky stars, because I think he had a pretty good chance of getting killed.
[01:29:29.890 --> 01:29:33.831]  Folks that haven't seen the film, people get killed around him quite a few times.
[01:29:33.831 --> 01:29:36.272]  Thank you so much, and again, we salute you.
[01:29:36.272 --> 01:29:37.453]  A great American filmmaker.
[01:29:37.453 --> 01:29:41.734]  Can't wait to follow your other work, sir.
[01:29:41.734 --> 01:29:42.935]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:42.935 --> 01:29:43.255]  Stay with us.
[01:29:43.255 --> 01:29:45.676]  I'm going to play the trailer for Cartel Land straight ahead.
[01:29:48.587 --> 01:29:51.588]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.588 --> 01:29:59.409]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.409 --> 01:30:05.251]  Since yesterday's early morning Virginia news shooting, we now know more about the shooter Vester Lee Flanagan.
[01:30:05.251 --> 01:30:10.652]  He exasperated his bosses with his stiff and nervous delivery and by his inability to use a teleprompter.
[01:30:10.652 --> 01:30:14.673]  He was also reprimanded for wearing a President Obama badge during an election report.
[01:30:14.793 --> 01:30:21.175]  In the report, his supervisor writes, this is a clear violation not only of Schertz County policy, but of standard journalistic ethics.
[01:30:21.175 --> 01:30:25.697]  Journalists, and particularly reporters who appear on television, must abide by a different standard.
[01:30:25.697 --> 01:30:29.319]  President Obama responded saying guns are worse than terrorism.
[01:30:29.319 --> 01:30:36.061]  What we know is that the number of people who die from gun-related incidents around this country dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism, the president added.
[01:30:36.061 --> 01:30:43.264]  Trump responded by saying, the problem is not guns, it's mental illness, which echoes the infamous appearance Alex Jones made on the Piers Morgan Show.
[01:30:43.424 --> 01:30:44.485]  How about Prozac?
[01:30:44.485 --> 01:30:46.826]  You know the number one... Oh, that's a big sponsor, isn't it?
[01:30:46.826 --> 01:30:48.427]  Don't want to talk about the U.S.
[01:30:48.427 --> 01:30:54.190]  number one cause of death is suicide now because they give people suicide mass murder pills!
[01:30:54.190 --> 01:30:57.032]  Check out the video reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[01:30:57.032 --> 01:30:58.833]  Rob Due reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:30:59.173 --> 01:31:08.255]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:31:08.255 --> 01:31:16.657]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:31:16.657 --> 01:31:21.538]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:31:21.538 --> 01:31:24.919]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[01:31:26.479 --> 01:31:27.199]  We're good to go.

[01:33:10.498 --> 01:33:15.342]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:33:15.342 --> 01:33:17.024]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:17.024 --> 01:33:18.685]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:18.685 --> 01:33:29.955]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.955 --> 01:33:33.618]  I want to open the phones up after I play several reports here.
[01:33:36.141 --> 01:33:41.930]  On what you think about the shooting last week of the TV reporter and the cameraman.
[01:33:41.930 --> 01:33:45.194]  Now the cold-blooded murder of this sheriff's deputy in Houston.
[01:33:47.415 --> 01:33:50.318]  And are you watching the same news I'm watching, reading the same papers I'm watching?
[01:33:50.318 --> 01:33:53.761]  I mean, there's hardly any news out there that this is racially motivated.
[01:33:53.761 --> 01:34:06.134]  The Associated Press is still acting like the Sheriff's Department is out of bounds for saying they believe it's connected to the national rhetoric being put out by Black Lives Matter.
[01:34:08.479 --> 01:34:19.088]  I mean, you better believe that if it was a white guy running around shooting black people, like with the Charleston situation, they would be saying it was racially motivated and then blaming all white people.
[01:34:19.088 --> 01:34:21.010]  Well, we're not blaming all black people for this.
[01:34:21.010 --> 01:34:25.154]  We're blaming mentally ill, unstable haters.
[01:34:25.154 --> 01:34:29.558]  And they need to be decried and explained to that this isn't good.
[01:34:32.554 --> 01:34:34.775]  When black people get murdered in cold blood, it's wrong.
[01:34:34.775 --> 01:34:36.897]  When cops get murdered in cold blood, it's wrong.
[01:34:36.897 --> 01:34:38.558]  When white people get murdered, it's wrong.
[01:34:38.558 --> 01:34:40.559]  It's just wrong.
[01:34:40.559 --> 01:34:45.702]  I don't sit there when nine blacks get killed and go, yeah, there's one for the white team.
[01:34:45.702 --> 01:34:49.524]  I go, there's one for the globalists who just orchestrated us getting in a fight with each other.
[01:34:52.130 --> 01:34:55.693]  That's why I've been harping on this, because you see movies like Cartel Land.
[01:34:55.693 --> 01:35:01.078]  The globalists want to convert America into a police state, drug war zone.
[01:35:01.078 --> 01:35:03.460]  That's why the government ships the narcotics in.
[01:35:03.460 --> 01:35:07.123]  But the government, with the big banks, ships it in from the top.
[01:35:07.123 --> 01:35:09.285]  We have the congressional hearings in the 60s, the 70s, and the 90s.
[01:35:11.516 --> 01:35:13.157]  We have the declassifications.
[01:35:13.157 --> 01:35:17.718]  We have the big banks that have admitted to laundering hundreds of billions a year.
[01:35:17.718 --> 01:35:19.619]  They control it.
[01:35:19.619 --> 01:35:22.400]  Then they have Hollywood act like the drug culture's cool.
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:25.601]  There's a lot of money associated with it, so young people get involved.
[01:35:25.601 --> 01:35:27.702]  Your daughters become prostitutes.
[01:35:27.702 --> 01:35:30.103]  It degenerates the society.
[01:35:30.103 --> 01:35:35.465]  And now our economy is based on the prisons and the drug war.
[01:35:35.465 --> 01:35:37.886]  So you get involved in a gangbanger culture.
[01:35:37.886 --> 01:35:38.906]  MTV pushes it.
[01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:43.612]  Acts like it's underground.
[01:35:43.612 --> 01:35:45.273]  The cops take the bait.
[01:35:45.273 --> 01:35:47.334]  Try to shut down the gangster rap.
[01:35:47.334 --> 01:35:48.995]  Everybody then thinks it's super cool.
[01:35:48.995 --> 01:35:53.757]  It goes white hot, super platinum.
[01:35:53.757 --> 01:35:58.320]  The young people all start dressing like prisoners with their pants hanging down around their butts.
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:00.961]  The cops are trained that's the enemy.
[01:36:00.961 --> 01:36:03.083]  You're trained the cops are the enemy.
[01:36:03.083 --> 01:36:07.105]  And then you have a full-on war in America, which has been on slow burn.
[01:36:08.336 --> 01:36:24.468]  But I believe we're about to see a slow-motion race war, a slow-motion drug war, that makes the 80s carnage and crime rate soaring look like a walk in the park.
[01:36:24.468 --> 01:36:27.270]  All the signs of destabilization are there.
[01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:34.856]  We're going into a depression, we have all these problems, and the system wants to brand it as racial so the globalists don't get the blame.
[01:36:36.314 --> 01:36:45.636]  And so the middle class, whether they be black or white, calls for law and order and gives up their rights because so many citizens and so many cops are getting killed.
[01:36:45.636 --> 01:36:52.738]  Then they're going to stage terror attacks, blame it on the Liberty Movement, and have a roundup of the Liberty Movement.
[01:36:52.738 --> 01:36:55.039]  They'll also be a roundup of the leftist black movement.
[01:36:57.475 --> 01:36:59.837]  And I'm telling you, that's where this is going.
[01:36:59.837 --> 01:37:16.292]  I told you long before this started, reading the manuals, reading the documents, reading the restricted info that we got from our sources, published here, confirmed to be accurate, that the only way they could pull this off, looking at their battle plan, was with what you're now seeing.
[01:37:16.292 --> 01:37:21.237]  So we were able to project forward the enemy battle plan.
[01:37:21.237 --> 01:37:23.218]  It's actually easier than connecting the dots.
[01:37:24.093 --> 01:37:27.094]  So I want to take a few phone calls on this issue.
[01:37:27.094 --> 01:37:29.495]  Has the race war already begun?
[01:37:29.495 --> 01:37:31.635]  And how do we short circuit it?
[01:37:31.635 --> 01:37:34.556]  I think you do like what happened in Charleston.
[01:37:34.556 --> 01:37:45.220]  Black folks, white folks, Hispanic, everybody coming together, prayer vigils, putting flowers at the church, decrying this little drug head, maggot that did it.
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:50.181]  Well, let's hear some people decrying what this latest scumbag did, shooting this cop.
[01:37:50.181 --> 01:37:51.402]  Turns out, didn't even know him.
[01:37:52.185 --> 01:37:53.548]  Hadn't done anything.
[01:37:53.548 --> 01:37:56.694]  And he cowardly shot him in the back.
[01:37:56.694 --> 01:37:57.997]  People say, oh, I'm sick of the cops.
[01:37:57.997 --> 01:37:58.598]  Good, let him die.
[01:37:59.844 --> 01:38:02.765]  How would you like it if it was somebody you knew, your neighbor, your dad?
[01:38:02.765 --> 01:38:04.366]  This guy had two children.
[01:38:04.366 --> 01:38:05.827]  He was involved in the community.
[01:38:05.827 --> 01:38:06.807]  He had a good record.
[01:38:06.807 --> 01:38:08.128]  And he's dead.
[01:38:08.128 --> 01:38:09.308]  Executed.
[01:38:09.308 --> 01:38:16.391]  All these leftists that call for killing cops, you're against the death penalty for people found guilty, but it's okay for you if a cop gets killed.
[01:38:16.391 --> 01:38:25.215]  And I'll tell you something, it's because you've never been involved in real violence, you've never seen real stuff go down, and so your little kids thinking it's tough to sit around talking about killing people.
[01:38:25.215 --> 01:38:26.496]  It's not tough, it's not cool.
[01:38:27.856 --> 01:38:30.598]  And here's the key.
[01:38:30.598 --> 01:38:42.087]  If things unravel in this civilization like it's starting to do, it's going to be you soft people out there and all you people on the left that want all these free government goodies.
[01:38:42.087 --> 01:38:48.151]  When the liberty's gone, when the prosperity's gone, the New World Order's not going to take care of you.
[01:38:48.151 --> 01:38:49.712]  They have no respect for you.
[01:38:49.712 --> 01:38:51.453]  You're useless.
[01:38:51.453 --> 01:38:52.294]  You're stupid.
[01:38:53.843 --> 01:38:56.326]  As long as you stay under their control.
[01:38:56.326 --> 01:38:57.787]  I want you to be free.
[01:38:57.787 --> 01:38:59.189]  I want you to wake up.
[01:38:59.189 --> 01:39:00.710]  I want you to get involved.
[01:39:00.710 --> 01:39:02.532]  I want you to see outside the box.
[01:39:02.532 --> 01:39:05.896]  I want you to be empowered.
[01:39:05.896 --> 01:39:07.337]  I'm a prideful person.
[01:39:07.337 --> 01:39:11.882]  I'm not saying that's good, but I have pride in humanity, pride in you, pride in myself.
[01:39:11.882 --> 01:39:12.823]  I want to believe in you.
[01:39:16.513 --> 01:39:40.724]  And that's why when I see MSNBC, MTV putting out weaponized media saying only whites can be racist, being white inherently is bad, whites deserve what they get, blah blah blah, it makes me so sick because the people running that are consciously evil and have a plan to bring this country down.
[01:39:40.724 --> 01:39:44.766]  And you have movies like Django and all the rest of it that
[01:39:46.033 --> 01:39:57.682]  Is meant to inflame racial division, meant to sell the idea that white people are inherently bad, and that you've personally been wronged, so you can go out and find some white people to kill.
[01:39:57.682 --> 01:40:06.810]  And that's the message that Hollywood wants to be put out, and it's all part of this climate being pushed with all these movies coming out at once.
[01:40:08.197 --> 01:40:10.239]  Focusing on police oppression.
[01:40:10.239 --> 01:40:11.901]  Focusing on police abuse.
[01:40:11.901 --> 01:40:20.549]  Not because they're going to reform the problems that are real, that we've tried to reform for 20 years, but because they want to have a clash of civilizations.
[01:40:20.549 --> 01:40:24.833]  Now let's go to this trailer, because I mentioned it, for Cartel Land.
[01:40:24.833 --> 01:40:27.175]  Here it is.
[01:40:27.175 --> 01:40:32.120]  There's an imaginary line up there between right and wrong, good and evil.
[01:40:37.365 --> 01:40:39.626]  I believe what I'm doing is good.
[01:40:39.626 --> 01:40:47.751]  And what I'm standing up against is evil.
[01:40:47.751 --> 01:40:49.072]  It's the cartels.
[01:40:49.072 --> 01:40:53.234]  They're the ones terrorizing their own country.
[01:40:53.234 --> 01:40:58.617]  And now they're starting to do it over here.
[01:41:08.587 --> 01:41:10.448]  What would you do?
[01:41:10.448 --> 01:41:12.650]  Wait for them to come for you?
[01:41:12.650 --> 01:41:24.117]  Or defend you?
[01:41:24.117 --> 01:41:31.762]  The cartel scouts keep getting away.
[01:41:31.762 --> 01:41:34.884]  The government doesn't provide the security guarantees the people need.
[01:41:34.884 --> 01:41:35.644]  Can we arm ourselves?
[01:41:42.283 --> 01:41:47.824]  They're taking back what is theirs from the cartel.
[01:41:47.824 --> 01:41:49.204]  This way should be done up here too.
[01:41:49.204 --> 01:41:52.925]  If anybody touches me, drop them.
[01:41:52.925 --> 01:42:00.607]  Isali?
[01:42:00.607 --> 01:42:04.247]  There's a law called eye for eye and tooth for tooth.
[01:42:04.247 --> 01:42:10.269]  Step back.
[01:42:16.357 --> 01:42:22.018]  I'm going to kill you!
[01:42:22.018 --> 01:42:26.059]  When are we going to become the criminals we're fighting?
[01:42:26.059 --> 01:42:26.880]  Who do you work with?
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:41.543]  You're watching this because I stopped existing.
[01:42:51.775 --> 01:42:54.858]  And again, it just came out about a month and a half ago.
[01:42:54.858 --> 01:42:58.141]  It's already pretty much left the theaters, but I thought it was a very powerful film.
[01:42:58.141 --> 01:42:59.462]  It deserved to be recognized.
[01:42:59.462 --> 01:43:03.386]  It deserved to get some attention here.
[01:43:03.386 --> 01:43:05.708]  Because you find out that the vigilantes on the U.S.
[01:43:05.708 --> 01:43:09.232]  side and on the Mexican side are basically the same people.
[01:43:09.232 --> 01:43:11.634]  They have the same views, the same beliefs, the same desires.
[01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:26.699]  It's the opposite of a Robert Rodriguez movie where Don Johnson's dressed up as a white racist sheriff shooting pregnant Mexican women in the stomach.
[01:43:26.699 --> 01:43:27.679]  That's not real.
[01:43:27.679 --> 01:43:28.919]  That's not going on.
[01:43:28.919 --> 01:43:29.979]  That's not happening.
[01:43:29.979 --> 01:43:36.581]  It's Mexicans that have killed over 100,000 Mexicans.
[01:43:36.581 --> 01:43:41.422]  But the political correct crowd would somehow try to imply that it was America's fault.
[01:43:41.422 --> 01:43:45.263]  That's why the White House, it came out in the memos, CBS News, three years ago.
[01:43:49.056 --> 01:43:54.760]  They shipped those guns down there so they could blame the violence on the Second Amendment.
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:44:02.126]  When the drug cartels are buying full auto from Europe and from the big banks.
[01:44:02.126 --> 01:44:12.153]  Turned out that a lot of those guns that got shipped down there ended up getting used by the citizens to fight off the drug cartels and to re-stabilize and take back control of the communities.
[01:44:12.153 --> 01:44:14.475]  The problem is the cartels then just kill the leadership
[01:44:15.871 --> 01:44:26.400]  of the good vigilante groups, or have the government put them in prison, and then take their number two guys, who they've bought off, and put them in charge.
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:28.962]  And that's the cycle of corruption.
[01:44:28.962 --> 01:44:31.965]  And it's happening here in this republic.
[01:44:31.965 --> 01:44:35.348]  And the system needs to cut it off now.
[01:44:35.348 --> 01:44:38.650]  We need to decriminalize drugs across the board now.
[01:44:38.650 --> 01:44:40.452]  That doesn't mean sell them to kids.
[01:44:40.452 --> 01:44:43.374]  It means treat them just like big pharma stuff.
[01:44:43.374 --> 01:44:43.835]  Control it.
[01:44:44.957 --> 01:44:50.902]  Tax it, regulate it, it'll take the criminal element out, but the big central banks are the main ones running it.
[01:44:50.902 --> 01:44:56.326]  That's why they lobby to keep the drug war going.
[01:44:56.326 --> 01:44:59.328]  Police departments are addicted to the money as well.
[01:44:59.328 --> 01:45:02.070]  It's corrupted many police departments.
[01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:05.693]  It's going to corrupt the whole nation if we don't stop it now.
[01:45:05.693 --> 01:45:07.754]  I have a big announcement I'm going to be making.
[01:45:07.754 --> 01:45:12.158]  I'm going to play this video that breaks it down.
[01:45:12.158 --> 01:45:13.499]  If we don't do this,
[01:45:16.249 --> 01:45:28.480]  I will be able to fund the launch of the InfoWar to hundreds of UHF, VHF and cable systems.
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:30.301]  We've got more than 50 that are showing interest.
[01:45:30.301 --> 01:45:36.187]  We've got six or seven that are already signed on, already currently taking it, just as we turned it on three weeks ago.
[01:45:38.499 --> 01:45:42.861]  It's well worth it if we reach 50 UHF, VHF, and 50 cable systems.
[01:45:42.861 --> 01:45:44.502]  I think it'll be a lot more than that.
[01:45:44.502 --> 01:45:45.822]  We already have places like Houston.
[01:45:45.822 --> 01:45:47.483]  We're on basic cable.
[01:45:47.483 --> 01:45:48.683]  That's a huge feat.
[01:45:48.683 --> 01:45:51.645]  And they also have a broadcast station down there.
[01:45:51.645 --> 01:45:53.926]  And we've got a lot of stations lining up to pick it up.
[01:45:53.926 --> 01:45:59.068]  What I don't have is the infrastructure for affiliate relations to work with the stations.
[01:45:59.068 --> 01:46:01.489]  What I don't have is enough reporters or writers.
[01:46:01.489 --> 01:46:03.090]  We have enough to do it basically
[01:46:04.346 --> 01:46:18.404]  But when you add all the money in for the closed captioning, satellite feeds, legal, other issues like that, we're going to expend all the capital this operation has.
[01:46:18.404 --> 01:46:19.946]  And that's not a good position to be in.
[01:46:19.946 --> 01:46:21.088]  You want to have some backup.
[01:46:23.183 --> 01:46:28.024]  Because we deal with the occasional dirty trick, the occasional problem, things we have to handle.
[01:46:28.024 --> 01:46:31.105]  I mean, any business, any operation needs really six months of capital.
[01:46:31.105 --> 01:46:32.925]  We got a couple months of capital.
[01:46:32.925 --> 01:46:35.846]  And if I do this, and if you don't support us, I'll expend that.
[01:46:35.846 --> 01:46:39.167]  Which I'm ready to do, because I'm not going to sit here and have half measures.
[01:46:39.167 --> 01:46:40.767]  I'm going to go all out against the globalists.
[01:46:40.767 --> 01:46:41.987]  We're going to skip this network break.
[01:46:41.987 --> 01:46:48.909]  It'll be the last one I skip today.
[01:46:48.909 --> 01:46:51.530]  But I do need your support.
[01:46:51.530 --> 01:46:52.470]  And I do need your help.
[01:46:54.104 --> 01:46:55.665]  We are in the face of the globalists.
[01:46:55.665 --> 01:46:58.746]  We're basically vigilante media.
[01:46:58.746 --> 01:47:00.366]  We transcend the labels.
[01:47:00.366 --> 01:47:01.527]  We're for basic freedom.
[01:47:01.527 --> 01:47:15.292]  You have a right to private property, a right to not be forced to take vaccines, a right to not have your guns taken, a right to be sovereign, a right to not have foreigners come in and get everything free, to be a political group, to vote you into slavery.
[01:47:15.292 --> 01:47:18.393]  I don't care what color you are, where you're from, you have basic rights.
[01:47:18.393 --> 01:47:21.574]  We promote basic pro-human ideas.
[01:47:21.574 --> 01:47:23.175]  We promote common sense.
[01:47:24.991 --> 01:47:27.232]  We promote life.
[01:47:27.232 --> 01:47:28.513]  You got left wing, you got right wing?
[01:47:28.513 --> 01:47:29.033]  No.
[01:47:29.033 --> 01:47:33.336]  There's the life wing, and there's the death wing.
[01:47:33.336 --> 01:47:35.417]  And the globalists are the cult of the death wing.
[01:47:38.151 --> 01:47:39.712]  That's the wings they fly on.
[01:47:39.712 --> 01:47:41.032]  It's what they live by.
[01:47:41.032 --> 01:47:42.072]  They are predators.
[01:47:42.072 --> 01:47:42.813]  They love death.
[01:47:42.813 --> 01:47:43.593]  They love disease.
[01:47:43.593 --> 01:47:44.613]  They love fraud.
[01:47:44.613 --> 01:47:45.654]  They love squalor.
[01:47:45.654 --> 01:47:47.394]  They love a dumbed-down population.
[01:47:47.394 --> 01:47:49.155]  They can feed on like cattle.
[01:47:49.155 --> 01:47:50.576]  I don't think you're cattle.
[01:47:50.576 --> 01:47:52.096]  I don't think I'm cattle.
[01:47:52.096 --> 01:47:56.518]  Because when I think of you as cattle, I've just dehumanized myself.
[01:47:56.518 --> 01:47:58.759]  That's a power trip.
[01:47:58.759 --> 01:48:01.100]  It's easier to laugh at the dumbed-down masses.
[01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:02.020]  I actually cry.
[01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:04.941]  I laugh on the surface because it's not funny.
[01:48:04.941 --> 01:48:06.582]  It makes me sick.
[01:48:06.582 --> 01:48:07.462]  It's gallows humor.
[01:48:09.804 --> 01:48:11.085]  I know I'm right.
[01:48:11.085 --> 01:48:12.727]  I know I'm dead on.
[01:48:12.727 --> 01:48:14.849]  I know I understand the enemy's operations.
[01:48:14.849 --> 01:48:15.890]  I've read their books.
[01:48:15.890 --> 01:48:17.151]  I've read their white papers.
[01:48:17.151 --> 01:48:18.833]  I've studied the New World Order.
[01:48:18.833 --> 01:48:20.074]  I know their game plan.
[01:48:20.074 --> 01:48:24.038]  We've accurately, on so many fronts, predicted what they're going to do.
[01:48:24.038 --> 01:48:26.701]  They can't stand it.
[01:48:26.701 --> 01:48:31.406]  And now, this operation needs to go to the next level, now!
[01:48:33.379 --> 01:48:47.123]  And believe me, I was sitting around talking to my dad last night at my grandmother's 90th birthday, or lunch, I should say, before the radio show, and I said, I know I can go to 40 million a week we're reaching, and if it does that, it'll be 100 million.
[01:48:47.123 --> 01:48:55.106]  I know I can get so big and so damaging to the globalists, they're gonna come after me, but I said, my cells won't let me not do it.
[01:48:56.237 --> 01:48:57.599]  It's not about showing off.
[01:48:57.599 --> 01:48:59.261]  It's not about wanting to fight.
[01:48:59.261 --> 01:49:03.647]  It's about knowing that I am aiding and abetting the New World Order if I don't go into this 110%.
[01:49:03.647 --> 01:49:07.793]  And I've got a Trump card, and that's Jesus Christ.
[01:49:07.793 --> 01:49:09.796]  And so it's whatever God's will is will happen to me.
[01:49:09.796 --> 01:49:10.737]  I'm at peace.
[01:49:10.737 --> 01:49:13.181]  The only selfish thing I ask God is to protect my children.
[01:49:14.417 --> 01:49:21.080]  And I will 100% never submit, never back down, never give in, never sell out.
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:23.501]  I commit before God Almighty.
[01:49:23.501 --> 01:49:33.185]  And all I ask is you, the listeners and viewers, to understand that none of us are perfect, none of us have all the answers, but if our heart's right, and if we want justice, and if we take action,
[01:49:34.245 --> 01:49:37.307]  God will lead, God will direct us, even if we don't believe in God.
[01:49:37.307 --> 01:49:40.669]  The universe, energy, whatever, providence, it works.
[01:49:40.669 --> 01:49:41.349]  It's real.
[01:49:41.349 --> 01:49:42.390]  The enemy knows it.
[01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:54.296]  They worship the God of death, and of disease, and of fraud, and of oppression, and of balkanization, and divide and conquer.
[01:49:54.296 --> 01:49:55.657]  It's easy to be evil.
[01:49:55.657 --> 01:49:57.958]  It's easy to play those games.
[01:49:57.958 --> 01:49:58.939]  I know how the new order works.
[01:49:58.939 --> 01:50:00.820]  I wanted to come in here and play their tactics.
[01:50:01.889 --> 01:50:05.932]  Even today, I could shoot to high levels in their organization.
[01:50:05.932 --> 01:50:10.575]  They've tried to hire me so many times, makes my head spin.
[01:50:10.575 --> 01:50:11.415]  That's what they do.
[01:50:11.415 --> 01:50:12.976]  They get you to join them.
[01:50:12.976 --> 01:50:14.377]  I'll never join them.
[01:50:14.377 --> 01:50:15.678]  Ever!
[01:50:15.678 --> 01:50:17.459]  And that's the commitment.
[01:50:17.459 --> 01:50:20.501]  But it's joining them to not go 110%.
[01:50:20.501 --> 01:50:22.662]  I didn't want to grow this operation eight years ago.
[01:50:22.662 --> 01:50:25.164]  I wanted to stay small.
[01:50:25.164 --> 01:50:27.906]  I wanted to just underground reach millions of people, make films.
[01:50:28.999 --> 01:50:36.801]  I knew how dangerous it was and I looked at myself in the mirror one day and I hit my knees and I just said, God, I don't want to be a coward.
[01:50:36.801 --> 01:50:37.801]  Help me be strong.
[01:50:37.801 --> 01:50:39.322]  Help me go all the way.
[01:50:39.322 --> 01:50:40.122]  And that's what we've done.
[01:50:40.122 --> 01:50:43.803]  And now I'm going to go even closer to the gates.
[01:50:43.803 --> 01:50:47.864]  I'm going to go all the way in, right into the throne room of the New World Order.
[01:50:48.604 --> 01:50:59.628]  Right up front, in front of the kings of this age, and let them know, as imperfect as I am, I stand for life, I stand for justice, and I'm not afraid.
[01:50:59.628 --> 01:51:03.429]  And whatever happens to me, that's in God's plan.
[01:51:03.429 --> 01:51:11.932]  So believe me, I don't want the work, I don't want the hassle of more reporters, and more writers, and more stuff, and more things I gotta worry about, and more things I gotta deal with, but I'm gonna do it.
[01:51:12.861 --> 01:51:26.577]  Because I'm going for broke, all in, doubling, tripling, quadrupling down, because I'm not gonna sit there when I'm 75, with my heart failing in some hospital, wishing I'd have gone all the way.
[01:51:26.577 --> 01:51:27.778]  Wishing I'd have fought harder.
[01:51:28.737 --> 01:51:30.238]  Wishing I would have done more.
[01:51:30.238 --> 01:51:32.601]  I'm gonna do it now!
[01:51:32.601 --> 01:51:34.122]  But I need your help to do it.
[01:51:34.122 --> 01:51:35.724]  So join me in this fight.
[01:51:35.724 --> 01:51:37.926]  Let's go to this piece we're putting out.
[01:51:37.926 --> 01:51:39.948]  We're posting it to InfoWars.com.
[01:51:39.948 --> 01:51:41.990]  Operation Money Bomb 2015.
[01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.670]  Email it.
[01:51:42.670 --> 01:51:43.291]  Twitter it.
[01:51:43.291 --> 01:51:44.112]  Facebook it.
[01:51:44.112 --> 01:51:46.374]  It's going up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:51:46.374 --> 01:51:52.760]  Help us get this video out to everyone and make it go viral so we can raise a million dollars to reach 400 million more people.
[01:51:53.564 --> 01:52:02.480]  If we reach 20 million more people a week, which is just doubling the audience, most of them tune in and out, in the aggregate that'll be about 400 million people in the next year.
[01:52:04.517 --> 01:52:09.100]  That's how many we're talking about in Mexico, the U.S., and Canada that potentially we can hit.
[01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:19.247]  But the derivatives of this, once we launch this, I'm gonna turn the satellites on in Europe, Africa, Asia, once we get the money.
[01:52:19.247 --> 01:52:27.252]  I plan to take profits, if we're able to put this on TV with a few ads per hour and make money, I intend to go worldwide with this.
[01:52:27.252 --> 01:52:30.414]  Now let's go ahead and go to this breakdown.
[01:52:34.551 --> 01:52:38.573]  Totalitarianism comes in many different flavors throughout history.
[01:52:38.573 --> 01:52:40.713]  It can come from the right wing, the left wing.
[01:52:40.713 --> 01:52:42.774]  It can come from religious cults.
[01:52:42.774 --> 01:52:45.955]  It can come from a foreign invading army.
[01:52:45.955 --> 01:52:52.598]  And in the modern 21st century, it's basically coming from political correctness.
[01:52:52.598 --> 01:53:00.381]  Masquerading as the Renaissance, masquerading as liberalism, it seeks to shut down free speech.
[01:53:01.301 --> 01:53:13.538]  And the controlled globalist left has willing accomplices in the Republican Party and other conservative and libertarian organizations and groups throughout the world.
[01:53:13.538 --> 01:53:16.862]  The robber barons that control this planet are not free market.
[01:53:17.734 --> 01:53:26.586]  They are monopoly men who seek to have systems free of competition controlled by offshore combines above the law.
[01:53:26.586 --> 01:53:31.993]  The main mission of InfoWars.com and my 20 years on air.
[01:53:32.874 --> 01:53:42.200]  ...is to shatter the left-right paradigm and to get the public to become aware of what's really governing and controlling society on a mass scale.
[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:47.304]  Bottom line, we have reached that legendary, colossal moment in history.
[01:53:48.104 --> 01:53:55.531]  Where the next thousand years of human development, our very destiny, is being decided.
[01:53:55.531 --> 01:53:59.714]  That's why we're launching Operation Money Bomb 2015.
[01:53:59.714 --> 01:54:03.518]  The first money bomb I've done in three years.
[01:54:03.518 --> 01:54:08.242]  Because we only do these if they're critical to be able to build up our infrastructure.
[01:54:08.602 --> 01:54:24.907]  And with the money we raise from this, we will be able to stay on the satellites and get on UHF, VHF, and cable stations across North America, reaching tens of millions of more people right at the time they're receptive and looking for answers.
[01:54:24.907 --> 01:54:30.209]  Starting September 16th through the 17th, we're going to broadcast live
[01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:32.009]  From 11 a.m.
[01:54:32.009 --> 01:54:34.570]  on the 16th through 2 p.m.
[01:54:34.570 --> 01:54:44.233]  on the 17th for 27 hours with an amazing lineup of guests, investigative journalists, documentary films, and more.
[01:54:44.233 --> 01:54:46.674]  We are seeking to raise a million dollars
[01:54:47.254 --> 01:54:53.980]  So that we can reach 400 million extra people potentially in the next year.
[01:54:53.980 --> 01:55:02.228]  Because if you do the math and if you look at the numbers that we're already getting from affiliates and from the internet and from YouTube and from Facebook and all the platforms.
[01:55:02.708 --> 01:55:06.490]  We are reaching 20 million people a week.
[01:55:06.490 --> 01:55:18.217]  If you put all that together over a year, that's upwards of 200 million different individuals around the world is how the algorithm metrics come out.
[01:55:18.217 --> 01:55:24.020]  So I simply want to double that in the next 12 months after launching this money bomb.
[01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:29.843]  Just the satellites, the closed captioning under federal law and other regulations will cost us right at
[01:55:30.263 --> 01:55:30.543]  Thank you.
[01:55:48.932 --> 01:56:00.058]  With the collapsing economy and the hard times we're going into, that we have the funds it takes to keep this beacon of truth exposing globalism and dehumanization operating.
[01:56:00.058 --> 01:56:14.466]  So join us this September 16th and 17th for what I believe will be the final money bomb that InfoWars ever runs as we prepare to launch to the next and final level of global awakening.
[01:56:14.466 --> 01:56:16.647]  Because as Mahatma Gandhi famously said,
[01:56:17.367 --> 01:56:19.568]  First, they ignore you.
[01:56:19.568 --> 01:56:21.148]  Then, they laugh at you.
[01:56:21.148 --> 01:56:22.629]  Then, they attack you.
[01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:23.889]  Then, you win.
[01:56:23.889 --> 01:56:26.990]  We are in that process of being massively attacked.
[01:56:26.990 --> 01:56:31.831]  And in the face, we're charging up, getting ready, and going in.
[01:56:31.831 --> 01:56:36.573]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash money bomb for all the information.
[01:56:36.573 --> 01:56:44.375]  And in closing, I want to say this to all of you patriots out there across the globe that spread the word about our operation and that have supported us.
[01:56:44.375 --> 01:56:46.056]  History is happening right now.
[01:56:46.916 --> 01:56:50.560]  The destiny of humanity is being decided right now.
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:59.650]  And Infowars, which you the viewers and listeners and activists stand at the heart of, is the engine that has made all this possible.
[01:56:59.650 --> 01:57:02.053]  You're not standing behind the Infowar.
[01:57:02.053 --> 01:57:03.895]  You are standing at the center of it.
[01:57:04.495 --> 01:57:08.056]  You are right beside us in this fight.
[01:57:08.056 --> 01:57:21.000]  And I guarantee you, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Sam Adams would be incredibly proud of what you've done in defense of human freedom, in defense of true liberty.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:26.361]  So from myself, Alex Jones, and the entire InfoWars crew, we salute you.
[01:57:26.361 --> 01:57:33.623]  Join us this September 16th and 17th for the 27-hour Money Bomb in defense of human liberty.

[01:57:49.606 --> 01:57:52.547]  The high quality nutraceuticals, the books, the videos, all of it.
[01:57:52.547 --> 01:58:02.550]  It just takes a lot of money to fund and run this operation and to pay my crew a livable wage so they can take care of their families and stay focused on the fight.
[01:58:03.729 --> 01:58:09.573]  But you can go to InfoWars.com forward slash show to find links.

[01:58:22.037 --> 01:58:25.498]  Always go crazy when we do stuff like this.
[01:58:25.498 --> 01:58:27.158]  But regardless, we're doing it.
[01:58:27.158 --> 01:58:28.858]  Regardless, we're launching it.
[01:58:28.858 --> 01:58:33.439]  So, InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWars.com forward slash money bomb.
[01:58:33.439 --> 01:58:36.000]  And please support our local MNF and affiliates as well.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:36.620]  We'll be back.
[01:58:36.620 --> 01:58:37.180]  Stay with us.
[01:58:37.180 --> 01:58:43.061]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.061 --> 01:58:45.222]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:49.295 --> 01:58:53.377]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[01:58:53.377 --> 01:59:03.842]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[01:59:03.842 --> 01:59:06.763]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[01:59:06.903 --> 01:59:15.711]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[01:59:15.711 --> 01:59:17.572]  This is the good halogen.
[01:59:17.572 --> 01:59:20.635]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[01:59:20.635 --> 01:59:32.646]  Now we at InfoWarsLife.com are bringing you the only source of clean, pure, 99.99 Ultra Pure Deep Earth Crystals from more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:59:32.646 --> 01:59:33.907]  Watch the informational videos
[01:59:34.227 --> 01:59:36.429]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:05.117 --> 02:00:09.962]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.962 --> 02:00:11.543]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.543 --> 02:00:13.085]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.085 --> 02:00:17.269]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.269 --> 02:00:21.333]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.195 --> 02:00:39.016]  Here's Paul Watson with a key report.
[02:00:39.016 --> 02:00:41.397]  We're going to talk about racism.
[02:00:41.397 --> 02:00:47.059]  According to MTV's Francesca Ramsey, it's impossible for black people to be racist.
[02:00:47.059 --> 02:00:55.281]  Ramsey claims that the dictionary definition of racism, the hatred or intolerance of another race, isn't the true meaning of racism.
[02:00:55.281 --> 02:00:56.862]  Because it's just the dictionary.
[02:00:57.042 --> 02:00:57.683]  Really?
[02:00:57.683 --> 02:00:59.025]  Isn't that convenient?
[02:00:59.025 --> 02:01:05.753]  So it's okay for social justice warriors to claim, just look at the dictionary definition, when it comes to feminism.
[02:01:05.753 --> 02:01:09.958]  All you morons who are too f***ing stupid to look up the definition of feminism.
[02:01:09.958 --> 02:01:13.523]  With no mention of the fact that radical feminism, in practice,
[02:01:13.863 --> 02:01:21.788]  has virtually nothing to do with the dictionary definition of feminism, but suddenly different rules apply when you're talking about racism.
[02:01:21.788 --> 02:01:26.731]  Ramsey says black people can't be racist towards white people, only prejudiced.
[02:01:26.731 --> 02:01:28.912]  Reverse racism is not a thing.
[02:01:28.912 --> 02:01:31.654]  First off, that has no legal basis whatsoever.
[02:01:31.654 --> 02:01:37.337]  According to the 1968 Civil Rights Act and the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act,
[02:01:37.677 --> 02:01:44.839]  A racially motivated hate crime carries the same punishment no matter the race of the perpetrator or the victim.
[02:01:44.839 --> 02:01:49.060]  Secondly, she claims it's only racism if it's backed by a major institution.
[02:01:49.060 --> 02:01:58.603]  But when a person of color discriminates or stereotypes a white person because of their race, in the United States, they don't have the institutional power to back them up and say that those feelings are okay.
[02:01:58.843 --> 02:02:00.844]  Oh, you mean like affirmative action?
[02:02:00.844 --> 02:02:10.768]  Major institutions of learning giving African-Americans college places based on their skin color and not their academic achievement in favor of whites.
[02:02:10.768 --> 02:02:12.048]  Is that racist?
[02:02:12.048 --> 02:02:19.311]  Goldsmiths University, a major institution, refusing to fire student diversity officer Bahama Stafford
[02:02:22.472 --> 02:02:26.795]  Is that racist?
[02:02:26.795 --> 02:02:43.943]  The major institution of media routinely ignoring or downplaying the fact that black people are 27 times more likely to attack white people than vice versa, while collectively blaming all white people when one nutcase goes on a rampage.
[02:02:43.943 --> 02:02:45.184]  Is that racist?
[02:02:45.184 --> 02:02:47.165]  Only white people can be racist.
[02:02:47.705 --> 02:02:48.365]  Really?
[02:02:48.365 --> 02:02:53.547]  Black people are racist, are the most racist people than any other race on this planet.
[02:02:53.547 --> 02:03:01.609]  Was it not racist when Bryce Williams shot dead Allison Parker live on air in order to create what he called a race war?
[02:03:01.609 --> 02:03:06.991]  Was it not racist when a gang of black radicals called for lynching whites and killing cops
[02:03:07.631 --> 02:03:12.615]  Just days before Deputy Darren Goforth was gunned down in cold blood.
[02:03:12.615 --> 02:03:19.621]  Was it not racist when the major institution of media refused to identify the suspect as black?
[02:03:19.621 --> 02:03:25.145]  Was it not racist when a black couple beat this white woman while yelling, wrong hood, bitch!
[02:03:31.185 --> 02:03:40.832]  Is it not racist for the major institution, which is MTV, to endlessly make TV shows and YouTube videos lecturing white people about how racist they are?
[02:03:40.832 --> 02:03:41.353]  Seriously.
[02:03:41.713 --> 02:03:44.777]  This channel is called MTV News.
[02:03:44.777 --> 02:03:47.641]  Music Television News.
[02:03:47.641 --> 02:03:52.608]  Yet over half of the previous 24 videos have been about racism.
[02:03:52.608 --> 02:03:58.696]  Plus it's completely inaccurate to claim that only major institutions wield power in today's society.
[02:03:59.156 --> 02:04:02.057]  Twitter outrage mobs wield huge power.
[02:04:02.057 --> 02:04:06.658]  We see them getting people fired and destroying people's lives all the time.
[02:04:06.658 --> 02:04:13.320]  And almost every time that happens, it's white people being publicly shamed for saying something politically incorrect.
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:17.201]  Good people can unintentionally say and do racist things.
[02:04:17.201 --> 02:04:20.582]  But not if you're killing white people to try and start a race war.
[02:04:20.582 --> 02:04:22.622]  No, that's not racist at all, is it?
[02:04:22.622 --> 02:04:27.084]  Or just wind up supporting racist institutions and practices without even realizing it.
[02:04:27.084 --> 02:04:27.764]  Alright, that's enough.
[02:04:29.073 --> 02:04:31.795]  Full reports up on InfoWars.com.
[02:04:31.795 --> 02:04:34.696]  We have to stop doing what the politically correct people tell us.
[02:04:34.696 --> 02:04:44.122]  They're nobodies on power trips that want to get society at each other's throats so they can play the part of the savior and the referees.
[02:04:44.122 --> 02:04:47.064]  So they need to be rebuked.
[02:04:47.064 --> 02:04:48.185]  They are the racist.
[02:04:48.185 --> 02:04:49.005]  They are the fraud.
[02:04:49.005 --> 02:04:50.306]  They are the joke.
[02:04:50.306 --> 02:04:52.167]  They know what they're doing.
[02:04:52.167 --> 02:04:54.108]  It's time to treat them with disdain.
[02:04:54.108 --> 02:04:56.289]  Not to coddle or grovel to them.
[02:04:56.289 --> 02:04:56.890]  That's the answer.
[02:04:59.221 --> 02:05:04.966]  On Sunday, crews removed the Jefferson Davis and Woodrow Wilson statues from the UT Main Mall.
[02:05:04.966 --> 02:05:13.772]  Since the church shooting in South Carolina, the Black Lives Matter movement had been calling for the removal of Confederate flags and Civil War statues from across the country.
[02:05:13.772 --> 02:05:15.434]  But did you know 12 U.S.
[02:05:15.434 --> 02:05:18.296]  presidents owned slaves, including Ulysses S. Grant?
[02:05:18.296 --> 02:05:19.817]  Now let's look at Woodrow Wilson.
[02:05:19.817 --> 02:05:27.283]  Here's a president that intentionally prolonged World War I at the behest of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace so America could be fundamentally changed.
[02:05:27.483 --> 02:05:35.587]  And if you look at the transfer of wealth that has taken place since then, a case could be made that Woodrow Wilson is probably the biggest purveyor of slavery in the United States.
[02:05:35.587 --> 02:05:37.868]  He also signed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.
[02:05:37.868 --> 02:05:42.030]  The Federal Reserve is still printing up free money and bailing out banks.
[02:05:42.030 --> 02:05:46.612]  The policies that he signed back in 1913 are keeping us all debt slaves today.
[02:05:46.612 --> 02:05:51.654]  But you won't find any mention of Woodrow Wilson, the Federal Reserve Act, or debt slavery in the mainstream media.
[02:05:51.914 --> 02:05:55.656]  You can see video of the statues being removed on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[02:05:55.656 --> 02:05:58.898]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.

[02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:09.463]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[02:07:09.463 --> 02:07:17.169]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.

[02:07:33.842 --> 02:07:37.425]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:07:37.765 --> 02:07:44.390]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:49.534]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[02:07:49.534 --> 02:07:53.256]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:53.256 --> 02:07:55.138]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:08:16.245 --> 02:08:20.922]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.638 --> 02:08:25.799]  I'm Bonnie Harre from foodbabe.com.
[02:08:25.799 --> 02:08:32.802]  As you may know, I'm known for getting the yoga mat chemical azodicarbonamide out of Subway's Famous Bread last year.
[02:08:32.802 --> 02:08:39.165]  Over 100,000 of you signed this petition, and without you, Subway would have never made this change.
[02:08:39.165 --> 02:08:42.026]  I thank you so much for making that happen.
[02:08:42.026 --> 02:08:46.087]  But I'm not here today to talk about yoga mats or shoe rubber.
[02:08:46.087 --> 02:08:50.149]  There's an even bigger issue that we need to address at Subway.
[02:08:50.149 --> 02:08:52.110]  I've been working with several experts
[02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:58.892]  ...and consumer advocacy groups for the past year on this very important issue, and we are now ready to take action.
[02:08:58.892 --> 02:09:00.613]  And we need your help.
[02:09:00.613 --> 02:09:05.834]  Subway is serving us meat that is raised with antibiotics, and this is irresponsible.
[02:09:05.834 --> 02:09:14.777]  That's because antibiotics are being routinely fed to farm animals, not to treat diseases, but to fatten them up and make them grow bigger on less food.
[02:09:14.777 --> 02:09:20.459]  Almost all of the antibiotics in the U.S., about 80% of them, are fed to farm animals.
[02:09:20.859 --> 02:09:29.422]  This overuse of growth-promoting antibiotics is creating superbugs that could threaten the entire human population.
[02:09:29.422 --> 02:09:37.824]  When animals are constantly fed low levels of antibiotics, they become a breeding ground for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and it's spreading to humans.
[02:09:37.824 --> 02:09:46.147]  We now have bacterial infections that only a few years ago could be cured and are now not responsive to any known antibiotics.
[02:09:46.707 --> 02:09:51.349]  Thousands of people are dying and experts believe it's going to get worse.
[02:09:51.349 --> 02:09:56.471]  Some major food companies have taken action by committing to stop this practice.
[02:09:56.471 --> 02:10:00.473]  Meanwhile, Subway headquarters is silent on the issue.
[02:10:00.473 --> 02:10:13.999]  This April, we sent a letter to the CEO of Subway, Fred DeLuca, asking him to engage with us to discuss opportunities for them to step up as leaders and to commit to eliminating these antibiotics from their chicken suppliers.
[02:10:14.159 --> 02:10:20.227]  And eventually to eliminate these antibiotics across all supply chains including their turkey, beef and pork.
[02:10:20.227 --> 02:10:23.572]  Subway has a responsibility to make this happen.
[02:10:23.572 --> 02:10:28.839]  Join us and sign the petition at foodbabe.com slash subwaymeat.
[02:10:28.839 --> 02:10:31.122]  I know together we can make this happen.
[02:10:34.983 --> 02:11:00.371]  Now Food Babe is only one of hundreds of prominent activists in North America, but she's probably had more than, I don't know, 20 or so successes with initiatives getting chemicals out of the beer, you name it, because this audience and other audiences take action, contact these different industries, and then once a big operation like McDonald's or Subway does the right thing, then basically everybody else follows suit.
[02:11:01.923 --> 02:11:11.570]  And if you look at the social engineering of the globalists and of the big petrochemical manufacturers, they're putting their toxic wastes as additives in the food.
[02:11:11.570 --> 02:11:13.371]  It's not just fluoride in the water.
[02:11:13.371 --> 02:11:16.373]  And again, they're cutting the fluoride in the water by half.
[02:11:16.373 --> 02:11:19.055]  They've banned it as a pesticide.
[02:11:19.055 --> 02:11:23.058]  They've gone from laughing at us 10 years ago to having to take action.
[02:11:23.058 --> 02:11:26.080]  Bisphenol A is being removed out of more and more plastics.
[02:11:28.169 --> 02:11:38.006]  This is a microcosm of every other political and socio-economic and cultural phenomenon when we take action, but it comes from the grassroots.
[02:11:38.006 --> 02:11:41.011]  You don't see the establishment right wing or left wing
[02:11:41.909 --> 02:11:44.230]  Coming up with really effective grassroots campaigns.
[02:11:44.230 --> 02:11:48.152]  They're like, oh, tax carbon that plants breathe.
[02:11:48.152 --> 02:11:55.056]  But ignore genetic engineering and all the rest of the serious stuff that really is damaging our environment and our way of life.
[02:11:55.056 --> 02:11:56.577]  We're part of the planet.
[02:11:56.577 --> 02:11:57.798]  What affects the planet affects us.
[02:11:58.792 --> 02:12:13.121]  And so people are always saying to me on the street, yeah, you know, you're against forced vaccines, you expose GMO, you're against fluoridation, all those things, but then you're not for carbon taxes, and you're not for, well, because it's a scam.
[02:12:13.121 --> 02:12:17.985]  China, if we shut down our power plants, has dirty plants and more of it goes into the air.
[02:12:17.985 --> 02:12:19.285]  I want clean plants.
[02:12:19.285 --> 02:12:20.326]  We have them.
[02:12:20.326 --> 02:12:21.207]  They're shutting them down.
[02:12:22.383 --> 02:12:28.567]  They show you water vapor in the winter, hot water vapor coming out of a smokestack, and go, look at the smoke!
[02:12:28.567 --> 02:12:31.949]  There is nothing there but water and carbon dioxide.
[02:12:31.949 --> 02:12:36.712]  Now they know they can't get you to list that as a pollutant, so they list carbon dioxide.
[02:12:36.712 --> 02:12:40.554]  The point is, is that the elite don't care about the planet.
[02:12:40.554 --> 02:12:45.277]  They sell their whole agenda, they do, but that's not what they're doing.
[02:12:45.277 --> 02:12:47.638]  I want my great-great-grandkids to have a planet.
[02:12:47.638 --> 02:12:48.759]  I want yours to have a planet.
[02:12:50.569 --> 02:13:00.293]  I'm concerned about all this, genuinely, and what makes me upset is all these George Soros-funded groups could care less.
[02:13:00.293 --> 02:13:19.481]  Now, VaniHariFoodBabe.com forward slash SubwayMeat, this is such a big deal because you can feed turkeys, chickens, cows, pigs, whatever species you're farming in really unsanitary, really horrible environments, and if you give them steroids, and if you give them hormones,
[02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:33.005]  And you give them other chemicals and you give them these toxic antibiotics, they will get fat, they will get bloated, even in piles of excrement and bugs all over.
[02:13:33.005 --> 02:13:36.270]  The problem is, that's unethical and torturing an animal.
[02:13:37.952 --> 02:13:40.793]  Then you're eating that, and it's being passed on.
[02:13:40.793 --> 02:13:44.694]  That's what's linked to obesity, health problems, the rise of superbugs.
[02:13:44.694 --> 02:13:45.754]  She just talked about that.
[02:13:45.754 --> 02:13:54.156]  And then every time she comes on, particularly this show and launches an initiative, they have articles attacking her, saying she's not a scientist.
[02:13:54.156 --> 02:13:58.197]  She is holding up studies and news articles and admissions.
[02:13:58.197 --> 02:14:06.959]  She's just articulate, attractive, smart, knows how to engage in public relations, and is a focal point of somebody that cares.
[02:14:08.109 --> 02:14:14.493]  And so they want to change the subject from what she's saying to, oh, look, it's just some pretty woman.
[02:14:14.493 --> 02:14:21.338]  Notice how, again, in the political correct world, if she was pushing something the system wanted, that would be decried.
[02:14:21.338 --> 02:14:27.983]  But because she's pushing something they don't want, they engage in sexist-type activities towards her.
[02:14:27.983 --> 02:14:32.146]  I mean, I don't care what color you are, if you're a woman or a man, if you're fighting for liberty.
[02:14:33.658 --> 02:14:40.162]  And fighting so that I don't have to go through a minefield to find meat to where my kids won't, you know, be sick all the time.
[02:14:40.162 --> 02:14:57.453]  And again, there's been massive pressure the last 15 years on synthetic bovine growth hormone in the milk that's made kids have all sorts of weird growth disorders, that's caused all sorts of premature puberty, all sorts of problems.
[02:14:58.700 --> 02:15:01.623]  If you want to go get a prescription and take growth hormone, that's your issue.
[02:15:01.623 --> 02:15:03.244]  There are some health risks, obviously.
[02:15:03.244 --> 02:15:04.805]  But should we put our children on it?
[02:15:04.805 --> 02:15:13.513]  And because of activists, I remember 15 years ago, 16 years ago, when they were suing Fox News out of Florida for running a report about it.
[02:15:13.513 --> 02:15:17.677]  When they would come after you if you criticized Roundup and do a slap suit.
[02:15:17.677 --> 02:15:19.959]  Notice we've come so far now, that's not really happening.
[02:15:21.052 --> 02:15:24.274]  Because we're on the march, we're winning.
[02:15:24.274 --> 02:15:26.215]  Now, that's my intro to that.
[02:15:26.215 --> 02:15:32.338]  Vani Hari, talk about your new initiative, but why don't you talk about some of the successes you've had, others have had.
[02:15:32.338 --> 02:15:34.939]  I mean, it looks like an avalanche of success.
[02:15:34.939 --> 02:15:39.042]  McDonald's is getting ready to basically go out of business, a lot of analysts think.
[02:15:39.042 --> 02:15:42.984]  Tyson instantly backs off and says, we'll stop buying tortured chickens.
[02:15:42.984 --> 02:15:46.666]  I mean, it's gone from belligerence to like, they're basically
[02:15:47.748 --> 02:15:55.493]  Capitulating in many fronts while still using PR firms to come after you, myself, and others.
[02:15:55.493 --> 02:15:59.536]  Yeah, there is an absolute avalanche of change happening.
[02:15:59.536 --> 02:16:02.117]  Thank you so much, first of all, for having me on here, Alex.
[02:16:02.117 --> 02:16:02.938]  I really appreciate it.
[02:16:02.938 --> 02:16:03.918]  It's been a little while.
[02:16:03.918 --> 02:16:07.741]  I went off the book tour and I needed to take a little break, but I'm back at it.
[02:16:07.741 --> 02:16:15.186]  And I'm back at it with this campaign because really, what's really important here, everything I've learned about the food industry,
[02:16:15.806 --> 02:16:17.227]  Every single thing.
[02:16:17.227 --> 02:16:23.593]  It all goes down to Monsanto, the GMOs, the corn and the soy that we're feeding all of these animals.
[02:16:23.593 --> 02:16:30.840]  And when we feed our animals things that aren't healthy, they got to keep them healthy in really inhumane environments.
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:32.882]  And that's what's happening with the antibiotic issue.
[02:16:33.562 --> 02:16:34.203]  I don't know.
[02:16:52.458 --> 02:17:00.587]  Then you've also got the fact that these antibiotics, they've found, increase the meat on these animals.
[02:17:00.587 --> 02:17:06.794]  It actually helps them grow faster, which actually produces more meat for the industry.
[02:17:06.794 --> 02:17:12.200]  And so these two practices, experts believe, and it's not only me who's saying this, I'm working with
[02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:15.422]  Several different groups that are pressuring Subway right now.
[02:17:15.422 --> 02:17:19.704]  Everyone from the NRDC to Friends of the Earth, Consumers Union, U.S.
[02:17:19.704 --> 02:17:24.287]  PIRG, FACT, I mean I have them all listed here, Center Food Safety.
[02:17:24.287 --> 02:17:30.090]  Sure, you always act in coalitions and then the mainstream media acts like you're just out here on your own making this up.
[02:17:30.598 --> 02:17:32.140]  Yeah, yeah, they do do that.
[02:17:32.140 --> 02:17:40.192]  And it's not even the mainstream media, it's the people that the food industry and the chemical industry have paid to be experts in this space.
[02:17:40.192 --> 02:17:44.398]  The same type of folks that say that they can drink Roundup, but then when they're asked to on camera won't do it.
[02:17:44.963 --> 02:18:05.513]  Yeah, oh absolutely, and there's a really great example of that happening very recently where a professor was quoted in the Atlantic, New York Times, NPR, and all articles critical about my work who was actually paid by Monsanto even though he told reporters when he was being interviewed that he has no ties to Monsanto.
[02:18:05.993 --> 02:18:14.857]  So, you know, thankfully, because of FOIA requests and other things, this information's coming out about how these so-called experts are tied to industry.
[02:18:14.857 --> 02:18:22.181]  But what's really interesting is this issue really affects all of us, whether we are vegan, vegetarian, whether we eat at Subway or not.
[02:18:23.001 --> 02:18:35.088]  The overuse of antibiotics can affect us because we can be subjected to these superbugs or antibiotic-resistant bacteria in our water, in our soil, on other food that you eat.
[02:18:35.088 --> 02:18:39.350]  So it's everywhere because the overuse of antibiotics... It's breeding superbugs!
[02:18:40.034 --> 02:18:40.995]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:18:40.995 --> 02:18:47.681]  Over 80% of the antibiotics used in this country is used on animals, they say.
[02:18:47.681 --> 02:18:52.044]  And Subway is one of the largest corporations in the world.
[02:18:52.044 --> 02:18:57.949]  They own, I think, close to $6 billion worth of purchasing power from the meat industry.
[02:18:57.949 --> 02:19:04.375]  And when I launched this campaign last Monday, on the heels of many other campaigns that were also launched,
[02:19:05.315 --> 02:19:12.597]  Not only did we get over 30,000 signatures in just a few days, but Subway was forced to respond by the end of week.
[02:19:12.597 --> 02:19:20.839]  So late Friday night they came out with a small concession saying that they're going to try to remove antibiotics from their chickens by 2016, but won't
[02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:23.520]  Talk
[02:19:41.428 --> 02:19:45.089]  Head over to foodbabe.com slash SubwayMeat and lend your voice.
[02:19:45.089 --> 02:19:46.150]  I really appreciate it.
[02:19:46.150 --> 02:19:51.332]  But even more so, go to Subway's Facebook page, tweet at them, ask them for more details.
[02:19:51.332 --> 02:19:53.933]  We deserve a formal commitment.
[02:19:53.933 --> 02:19:54.833]  Absolutely.
[02:19:54.833 --> 02:19:57.854]  We need to be concerned about our food and the garbage that's in it.
[02:19:57.854 --> 02:19:59.015]  This is about a global awakening.
[02:20:00.103 --> 02:20:07.390]  If you're worried about your health and you're tired of the nasty side effects of harsh drugs or antibiotics, then look no further.

[02:20:59.065 --> 02:21:03.311]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:21:03.311 --> 02:21:03.932]  It's true.
[02:21:03.932 --> 02:21:08.098]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:21:08.098 --> 02:21:10.481]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:21:10.481 --> 02:21:14.948]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[02:24:07.317 --> 02:24:09.778]  Since we mentioned it, it's so unbelievable.
[02:24:09.778 --> 02:24:13.440]  New listeners may not have actually seen or heard this, so I think I'm making it up.
[02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:31.548]  Here's Patrick Moore, a big chemical lobbyist connected to Monsanto, who'd gone around for years saying he would drink a glass of Roundup, or glyphosate, and that it was safe enough to drink, and when the reporter, I guess with CBC, asked him to do it, he won't do it.
[02:24:32.312 --> 02:24:36.035]  And then I have CBS News saying mercury is good for your children.
[02:24:36.035 --> 02:24:37.296]  That's what the industry says.
[02:24:37.296 --> 02:24:38.417]  So take your vaccines.
[02:24:38.417 --> 02:24:43.461]  Well, I'm no rocket scientist, but glyphosate is connected to cancer, very poisonous.
[02:24:43.461 --> 02:24:44.863]  That's been known forever.
[02:24:44.863 --> 02:24:47.765]  They suppressed that in the studies back in the 80s.
[02:24:47.765 --> 02:24:51.748]  And mercury is one of the most deadly heavy metals in the body.
[02:24:51.748 --> 02:24:59.235]  But here is that famous clip from, I guess, about two years ago, where he was confronted and said, all right, here's a glass of Roundup, bud.
[02:24:59.235 --> 02:25:00.015]  Go ahead and drink it.
[02:25:00.015 --> 02:25:00.376]  Here it is.
[02:25:01.510 --> 02:25:06.554]  I do not believe that glyphosate in Argentina is causing increases in cancer.
[02:25:06.554 --> 02:25:09.896]  You can drink a whole quart of it and it won't hurt you.
[02:25:09.896 --> 02:25:10.817]  You want to drink some?
[02:25:10.817 --> 02:25:11.638]  We have some here.
[02:25:11.638 --> 02:25:13.379]  I'd be happy to, actually.
[02:25:13.379 --> 02:25:14.780]  Not really.
[02:25:14.780 --> 02:25:15.220]  Not really?
[02:25:15.220 --> 02:25:16.742]  I know it wouldn't hurt me.
[02:25:16.742 --> 02:25:17.702]  If you say so.
[02:25:17.702 --> 02:25:18.683]  I have some glyphosate.
[02:25:18.683 --> 02:25:19.564]  No, I'm not stupid.
[02:25:20.024 --> 02:25:23.066]  Okay, so you you know, but I know it's dangerous.
[02:25:23.066 --> 02:25:26.829]  I know people try to commit suicide with it and fail fairly regularly.
[02:25:26.829 --> 02:25:27.470]  Tell the truth.
[02:25:27.470 --> 02:25:29.031]  It's not dangerous to humans.
[02:25:29.031 --> 02:25:29.912]  No, it's not.
[02:25:29.912 --> 02:25:31.833]  So are you ready to drink one glass?
[02:25:31.833 --> 02:25:33.935]  No, I'm not an idiot.
[02:25:33.935 --> 02:25:35.516]  Interview me about golden rice.
[02:25:35.516 --> 02:25:37.017]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:25:37.017 --> 02:25:38.038]  Okay, then it's finished.
[02:25:38.038 --> 02:25:40.119]  Then the interview is finished.
[02:25:40.119 --> 02:25:41.841]  That's a good way to solve things.
[02:25:41.841 --> 02:25:43.522]  Yeah.
[02:25:43.522 --> 02:25:44.383]  You're a complete jerk.
[02:25:47.691 --> 02:25:50.876]  I think, guys, just Google, Mercury's good for you.
[02:25:50.876 --> 02:25:52.298]  And it's a CBS thing.
[02:25:52.298 --> 02:25:54.321]  Uh-oh, we have it here.
[02:25:54.321 --> 02:25:55.964]  Let's play Mercury's good for you.
[02:25:55.964 --> 02:25:57.607]  Because remember, we're the conspiracy theorists.
[02:25:58.476 --> 02:26:01.577]  You know, hey, they drink it and only die some of the time from a glass of it.
[02:26:01.577 --> 02:26:02.518]  You know, it's not that bad.
[02:26:02.518 --> 02:26:05.419]  It only kills you some of the time if you drink a whole glass right away.
[02:26:05.419 --> 02:26:07.040]  And you know, mercury?
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:08.921]  You drink a teaspoon of it, it'll kill you.
[02:26:08.921 --> 02:26:09.461]  But you know what?
[02:26:09.461 --> 02:26:10.702]  It's good for you.
[02:26:10.702 --> 02:26:11.862]  It's good in the vaccine.
[02:26:11.862 --> 02:26:13.183]  Here it is.
[02:26:13.183 --> 02:26:18.005]  And stick of your glasses and contact lenses, a new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[02:26:18.005 --> 02:26:18.365]  Yay!
[02:26:18.365 --> 02:26:21.447]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter, Steven Mapper.
[02:26:24.036 --> 02:26:30.479]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[02:26:30.479 --> 02:26:37.401]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[02:26:37.401 --> 02:26:44.524]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:26:44.524 --> 02:26:46.525]  And if you have a business, you didn't build that?
[02:26:46.525 --> 02:26:48.126]  And two plus two equals five?
[02:26:48.886 --> 02:26:53.892]  And under Obamacare it's free, which it's not, and everything else.
[02:26:53.892 --> 02:26:55.394]  And nobody's coming after your guns either.
[02:26:56.670 --> 02:26:59.611]  Vani Har, this is a short segment, 18-minute long segment coming up.
[02:26:59.611 --> 02:27:04.994]  We can really flesh this out in some of the latest news, but foodbabe.com forward slash subway meet.
[02:27:04.994 --> 02:27:07.095]  Folks need to get your latest promo video.
[02:27:07.095 --> 02:27:09.196]  They need to send it out on Twitter, Facebook.
[02:27:09.196 --> 02:27:14.979]  They need to contact Subway, because it seems like every time we take action now, they're caving in.
[02:27:14.979 --> 02:27:22.463]  And so many ads I see for fast food now, or grocery stores, period, or advertising, we're fresh, we're organic, we're safe.
[02:27:22.463 --> 02:27:24.564]  It seems like we're reaching a critical mass moment.
[02:27:25.393 --> 02:27:42.866]  Yeah, you know, finally people, because of the Subway campaign last year that I actually announced here on the day that I launched it to get out azodicarbonamide, the yoga mat chemical out of Subway bread, finally opened people's eyes up to eating fresh isn't really eating fresh.
[02:27:42.866 --> 02:27:45.708]  And now people need to pay attention to the meat.
[02:27:45.868 --> 02:27:51.472]  Because 7.6 million subs are sold every single day by Subway.
[02:27:51.472 --> 02:27:57.196]  They are the largest by number of chains of restaurants, even though they're losing money just like McDonald's.
[02:27:57.196 --> 02:28:02.340]  I think they lost more money last year than even McDonald's from the reports that I just read.
[02:28:02.340 --> 02:28:06.503]  And so this is really a shift in consumer perspective and there's a whole like
[02:28:06.903 --> 02:28:13.247]  Snowball revolution of changes happening where these corporations are starting to remove artificial food dyes.
[02:28:13.247 --> 02:28:15.389]  They're starting to go antibiotic free.
[02:28:15.389 --> 02:28:18.271]  They're starting to offer more organic options.
[02:28:18.271 --> 02:28:20.472]  But we've got a long way to go.
[02:28:20.472 --> 02:28:27.377]  And unfortunately, some of these brands have lost so much of our trust that I don't know if they'll even survive.
[02:28:27.377 --> 02:28:36.243]  And really, you know, you see that with McDonald's, you see that with Subway, and there's so many other trust issues happening with Subway as it is.
[02:28:36.243 --> 02:28:36.543]  And so
[02:28:36.943 --> 02:28:58.049]  We're really at a critical moment here where our voting with our dollars, our petitioning these companies, our making more and more people aware of these issues is really creating a shift in momentum in terms of conventional food that was poorly raised, full of toxins, to now food that is organic and real and whole.
[02:28:58.049 --> 02:28:59.869]  And that is really what we need to go back to.
[02:28:59.889 --> 02:29:03.652]  That's creating a whole new economy for us where that food can now be exported.
[02:29:03.652 --> 02:29:18.744]  I've been reading how we have to import most of our organic food and the farming associations aren't even telling farmers, hey you can be making a lot of money with organics because there's such a culture controlled by big pharma and by the big industries to not let farmers know this.
[02:29:19.502 --> 02:29:41.630]  Yeah and you know you look at Chipotle and they're having to get some of their beef and pork from other countries because we just don't have enough here that's raised humanely that isn't antibiotic free and so we're you know now outsourcing our food and we need to go back and take a look at our farmers here and see how we can change their practices from within and that's how these type of campaigns start to do that.
[02:29:41.630 --> 02:29:47.172]  Once huge companies like Subway and others like McDonald's and Chick-fil-A and others who have actually made
[02:29:47.312 --> 02:29:48.313]  It scales the whole market.
[02:29:48.313 --> 02:29:50.056]  It's like when Walmart carries your product.
[02:29:50.056 --> 02:29:51.098]  It's set.
[02:29:51.098 --> 02:29:52.740]  I mean, we make them cave in, it's over.
[02:29:52.740 --> 02:29:53.301]  We'll be back.
[02:29:59.218 --> 02:30:01.880]  Here's a story for all you supporters of the war on drugs.
[02:30:01.880 --> 02:30:07.104]  Cocaine production plummets after DEA kicked out of Bolivia from the website TheAntimedia.org.
[02:30:07.104 --> 02:30:15.130]  According to data released by the United Nations, cocaine production in that country declined by 11% in the past year, making the fourth year in a row of steady decrease.
[02:30:15.130 --> 02:30:17.832]  It was just seven years ago that the DEA was kicked out of Bolivia.
[02:30:18.092 --> 02:30:20.654]  And only three years after that, progress was finally made.
[02:30:20.654 --> 02:30:27.679]  The strategy employed by the Bolivian government may surprise many prohibitionists because it did not involve strong-arm police state tactics.
[02:30:27.679 --> 02:30:32.663]  Instead, they worked to find alternative crops for farmers to grow that would actually make them more money.
[02:30:32.663 --> 02:30:34.144]  Bolivia has adopted a policy
[02:30:34.304 --> 02:30:42.487]  Where coca cultivation is allowed in traditional areas alongside alternative development and others, said Antonio DeLeo from the UN Office of Drugs and Crime.
[02:30:42.487 --> 02:30:42.968]  The U.S.
[02:30:42.968 --> 02:30:46.649]  is still involved in Afghanistan, and look at the heroin production coming out of that area.
[02:30:46.649 --> 02:30:47.870]  It has skyrocketed.
[02:30:47.870 --> 02:30:50.351]  Is the United States really against the war on drugs?
[02:30:50.351 --> 02:30:52.331]  Or is it just against the people who use them?
[02:30:52.331 --> 02:30:55.753]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.

[02:33:24.281 --> 02:33:28.044]  Drugs report has them lined up nicely.
[02:33:28.044 --> 02:33:29.504]  Cop hunting.
[02:33:29.504 --> 02:33:33.107]  Houston deputy shot 15 times in the back.
[02:33:33.107 --> 02:33:35.208]  Suspect in ambush held without bond.
[02:33:35.208 --> 02:33:38.370]  Sheriff says Obama started this war on police.
[02:33:38.370 --> 02:33:43.833]  Dangerous rhetoric as Black Lives Matter continues to chant pigs in a blanket.
[02:33:43.833 --> 02:33:44.774]  Cop hunting.
[02:33:47.663 --> 02:33:52.525]  is what the suspect reportedly was out doing.
[02:33:52.525 --> 02:33:59.248]  And it's all directly out of the whole Black Lives Matter movement.
[02:33:59.248 --> 02:34:07.411]  Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs will host the entire fourth hour today at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:34:07.411 --> 02:34:11.253]  We're bringing the fourth hour back, so affiliates are welcome to start picking that hour up.
[02:34:13.399 --> 02:34:25.610]  And they're going to have a man running for sheriff who's endorsed by Sheriff Arpaio, by Richard Mack, who's a constitutionalist, and he's down there to give us the inside scoop on what happened.
[02:34:27.222 --> 02:34:32.664]  And on where he sees the situation going, Vani Hari, the food babe, is with us.
[02:34:32.664 --> 02:34:37.266]  I've got a bunch of medical, food news, cannabis news I want to run over with her.
[02:34:37.266 --> 02:34:47.951]  Anthony Guciardi's here, who's our food and health reporter in studio with Vani Hari, the food babe, launching another initiative.
[02:34:47.951 --> 02:34:49.632]  Let me ask you this question, food babe.
[02:34:52.110 --> 02:34:56.254]  Talk about globalism or all these other things that are being pushed by the establishment.
[02:34:56.254 --> 02:35:03.460]  Once the people turn against them, it doesn't matter how much support they put behind it, it's over.
[02:35:03.460 --> 02:35:05.662]  To me, I keep saying this, this really is the model.
[02:35:06.576 --> 02:35:14.283]  Of how to bring down so many other things that are being force-fed from the top down, all these initiatives coming to a head.
[02:35:14.283 --> 02:35:23.791]  I mean, sure, Monsanto shot down mandatory labeling in California and other states, but just the process of the public being educated made them go out and make their right decision anyways.
[02:35:23.791 --> 02:35:29.036]  So it doesn't matter if they stole those elections, stole those referendums, which I think they did.
[02:35:29.036 --> 02:35:30.257]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[02:35:31.385 --> 02:35:35.767]  The battle in the court of public opinion is what is going to end up bringing them down.
[02:35:35.767 --> 02:35:38.528]  So how do you expect this to now flesh out?
[02:35:38.528 --> 02:35:40.449]  What do you think the next shoe to drop is?
[02:35:40.449 --> 02:35:43.570]  And how do you think they're going to strike back?
[02:35:43.570 --> 02:35:48.252]  So I think what's happening right now is you've got an interesting situation.
[02:35:48.252 --> 02:35:54.354]  You've got major fast food chains losing money hand over fist every single quarter.
[02:35:54.354 --> 02:35:58.476]  You've got the conventional food sector losing money or staying stagnant.
[02:35:58.476 --> 02:35:59.156]  The only
[02:35:59.676 --> 02:36:16.765]  Companies that are continuing to increase in growth or organic and natural and when they increase in growth or they increase in Just consumer demand what I see happening now is these multi billion dollar conglomerates are actually buying up these corporations we've seen
[02:36:17.325 --> 02:36:22.088]  We've got Hormel by Applegate, which is an organic, sustainable meat brand.
[02:36:22.088 --> 02:36:24.329]  We've got General Mills by Annie's.
[02:36:24.329 --> 02:36:29.833]  We've just got Coca-Cola, who's investing in Suja Juice, that is a green juice company.
[02:36:29.833 --> 02:36:41.300]  And so, really, these major corporations, I don't know if they'll ever be gone in terms of the big, major food corporations, or if they're going to just continue to buy up
[02:36:41.860 --> 02:36:42.621]  Consumers
[02:37:02.961 --> 02:37:07.665]  So that's how they're striking back, and we see that with the TPP, the multinational model.
[02:37:07.665 --> 02:37:15.091]  They come in, they buy them up, then they change the rules and laws so you can't keep GMO out of your country and you can't label.
[02:37:15.091 --> 02:37:22.258]  And so they buy it up, then they change the laws, and no matter how many companies we try to go patronize or support, they just buy those up.
[02:37:22.258 --> 02:37:24.800]  So that's how the empire is going to strike back.
[02:37:25.927 --> 02:37:28.089]  That's exactly what's going to happen.
[02:37:28.089 --> 02:37:38.235]  And what we can do as consumers is just shape their products and hold them accountable when they do buy these different organic and natural brands to make sure they don't change.
[02:37:38.235 --> 02:37:44.099]  Now, some organic brands have changed dramatically when they've been bought by these bigger corporations.
[02:37:44.099 --> 02:37:45.119]  I'll give you an example.
[02:37:45.119 --> 02:37:49.842]  Campbell's bought Plum Organics, which is a baby food company, was 100% organic.
[02:37:49.842 --> 02:37:53.465]  And now they have non-organic meat products and dairy products in Target.
[02:37:54.065 --> 02:38:16.109]  So, like, people are buying plum thinking it was organic or healthier, healthier than the alternative of Gerber and other things, but now they're watering down their food, and so it's really important for us to always stay on our toes, read ingredient labels, and make sure these companies don't change their ingredients and practices after they've been bought by these major conglomerates.
[02:38:16.109 --> 02:38:21.310]  One of the other big angles you're looking at right now, and then I've got Anthony Gucciardi here with some breaking news to get your take on.
[02:38:22.435 --> 02:38:26.658]  Yeah, the other big angles that I'm looking at right now is false advertising.
[02:38:26.658 --> 02:38:38.166]  You know, just this morning I learned of Chipotle being sued in San Francisco because they are under the impression, consumers are under the impression that it's completely GMO free.
[02:38:38.166 --> 02:38:45.631]  However, their meat, some of their meat is raised with GMO feed and then also they're still serving Coca-Cola that's full of GMOs.
[02:38:45.631 --> 02:38:47.293]  And so consumers are now
[02:38:47.873 --> 02:38:50.094]  Contacting lawyers and saying, you know what?
[02:38:50.094 --> 02:38:51.374]  It's not all GMO free.
[02:38:51.374 --> 02:38:57.017]  This is false advertising and they're suing even the good guys that are trying to do the right thing.
[02:38:57.017 --> 02:39:09.562]  And so I've seen that start to happen as well as I see what's happening right now within awareness that's happening in terms of understanding what's GMO free and what's not.
[02:39:09.562 --> 02:39:11.902]  And there's a lot of different false advertising going on.
[02:39:11.902 --> 02:39:14.503]  I'll give you another example is Boar's Head Products.
[02:39:14.503 --> 02:39:15.604]  This is a major meat
[02:39:16.124 --> 02:39:17.584]  Yeah, I think it's a great question.
[02:39:17.584 --> 02:39:18.524]  I think it's a great question.
[02:39:18.524 --> 02:39:20.045]  I think it's a great question.
[02:39:20.045 --> 02:39:21.345]  I think it's a great question.
[02:39:21.345 --> 02:39:22.025]  I think it's a great question.
[02:39:22.025 --> 02:39:23.305]  I think it's a great question.
[02:39:23.305 --> 02:39:24.445]  I think it's a great question.
[02:39:24.445 --> 02:39:25.706]  I think it's a great question.
[02:39:25.706 --> 02:39:27.266]  I think it's a great question.
[02:39:27.266 --> 02:39:28.426]  I think it's a great question.
[02:39:28.426 --> 02:39:29.746]  I think it's a great question.
[02:39:29.746 --> 02:39:30.687]  I think it's a great question.
[02:39:30.687 --> 02:39:32.067]  I think it's a great question.
[02:39:32.067 --> 02:39:32.867]  I think it's a great question.
[02:39:32.867 --> 02:39:33.767]  I think it's a great question.
[02:39:33.767 --> 02:39:34.727]  I think it's a great question.
[02:39:34.727 --> 02:39:36.267]  I think it's a great question.
[02:39:36.267 --> 02:39:37.268]  I think it's a great question.
[02:39:45.389 --> 02:39:53.417]  Absolutely.
[02:39:53.417 --> 02:40:00.063]  People are trying to, you know, ride this wave and say they're natural, say they're artificial free, but they're not quite there yet.
[02:40:00.063 --> 02:40:08.732]  And so it's up to us, you know, activists and other consumers who are becoming aware about all these different intricacies to like speak up and make sure people know about it.
[02:40:09.426 --> 02:40:13.412]  Anthony Gucciardi, you've got a bunch of news basically integrated into what she's saying.
[02:40:13.412 --> 02:40:16.737]  I do have a lot of news and also I want to say there is a lot of deception in labeling.
[02:40:16.737 --> 02:40:21.524]  For example, I've pointed out before, someone can call something like an organic line.
[02:40:21.524 --> 02:40:23.026]  I could say, Anthony's Organics.
[02:40:23.456 --> 02:40:23.636]  I don't
[02:40:42.981 --> 02:40:44.162]  Real purified water?
[02:40:44.162 --> 02:40:48.383]  Yeah, that's one attack I hear is, oh, none of it's perfect, you can never do it, just go with everything bad.
[02:40:48.383 --> 02:40:49.864]  That used to be my attitude.
[02:40:49.864 --> 02:40:50.544]  No!
[02:40:50.544 --> 02:40:55.026]  No, we change it by trying to make our lives better and others' lives better incrementally.
[02:40:55.026 --> 02:40:58.867]  Exactly, because listening to all this, it's super overwhelming for the average person.
[02:40:58.867 --> 02:41:03.329]  The average person doesn't even know really what a GMO is or how to know if they're eating GMOs.
[02:41:03.329 --> 02:41:11.052]  So when we talk about all these things the corporations are doing, buying up all these organic companies, which is going on, it's almost impossible to catch every little angle.
[02:41:11.212 --> 02:41:15.795]  Even with these things like the registered trademarks where it says Joe's Organics and it's not even organic.
[02:41:15.795 --> 02:41:19.778]  But just buying organic and trying your best to be healthy is key.
[02:41:19.778 --> 02:41:22.740]  And I think it is motivational to think about how much you're avoiding.
[02:41:22.740 --> 02:41:23.880]  Because look at this study.
[02:41:23.880 --> 02:41:24.381]  Study.
[02:41:24.381 --> 02:41:27.243]  GMO soy accumulates cancer-causing formaldehyde.
[02:41:27.243 --> 02:41:28.464]  This is a new study.
[02:41:28.464 --> 02:41:40.812]  In a groundbreaking new study published in the peer-reviewed journal Agricultural Sciences, researchers have found that when soy is genetically engineered, it disrupts the plant's natural ability to control stress and sparks the production of carcinogenic formaldehyde.
[02:41:41.572 --> 02:41:58.503]  The new research, led by MIT-trained biologists, the researchers discovered that the accumulation of formaldehyde, the known carcinogen, and a dramatic depletion of glutathione, which is essential for your overall production of the liver, an antioxidant necessary for cellular detoxification, is a result of genetic tinkering with soy plants.
[02:41:58.503 --> 02:42:01.705]  So they're messing with soy, modifying it.
[02:42:01.705 --> 02:42:03.045]  They admit they don't know what's happening.
[02:42:03.045 --> 02:42:04.727]  They admit they don't know what's going on.
[02:42:04.727 --> 02:42:08.149]  Former EPA scientists are voicing their opposition against this.
[02:42:08.149 --> 02:42:09.750]  Everyone is freaking out about this new study.
[02:42:10.510 --> 02:42:12.811]  And we're still sitting here eating it.
[02:42:12.811 --> 02:42:19.254]  We know it's causing formaldehyde to develop in the accumulation when they mess with the soy, but we're still eating it.
[02:42:19.254 --> 02:42:24.476]  That's why, like Alex was saying earlier, we're being forced to import soy from Romania.
[02:42:24.476 --> 02:42:28.177]  Because, organic soy, because people aren't buying the GMOs anymore.
[02:42:28.177 --> 02:42:30.138]  The House of Cards is crumbling.
[02:42:30.138 --> 02:42:30.878]  We are deflated.
[02:42:30.878 --> 02:42:37.701]  That's what's crazy, the only farmers we know, because we're in farming and ranching family business still, is organics.
[02:42:37.701 --> 02:42:39.942]  Real organic, and you gotta get the certifications
[02:42:41.773 --> 02:42:48.159]  And they'll be farmers going out of business because all they know how to do is deal with Monsanto or Archer Daniels Midland.
[02:42:48.159 --> 02:42:53.764]  They don't know that the free market is the way for them out because you'll go to the farmers market
[02:42:54.775 --> 02:43:06.078]  You'll go to one of these events where they've got the Blue Ribbon Pigs and the rest of it, the fair, and it's all sponsored by Monsanto, and it's only their farmers that are there.
[02:43:06.078 --> 02:43:16.140]  So they are using the ignorance of folks to continue this, and America is exceptional in that we are exceptionally unhealthy, we have exceptional amounts of GMO.
[02:43:16.880 --> 02:43:23.645]  Vani Hari, I've seen the statistics, but aren't we in the top two or three worst nations for additives and GMO?
[02:43:23.645 --> 02:43:28.269]  Don't we lead the world in a GMO toxic dumping ground?
[02:43:28.863 --> 02:43:29.884]  No, absolutely.
[02:43:29.884 --> 02:43:34.606]  And we're one of the only countries that doesn't label GMOs, even though 65 other countries do.
[02:43:34.606 --> 02:43:39.668]  Russia, China, India, most of, you know, some countries.
[02:43:39.668 --> 02:43:42.229]  I just went to Tanzania and Rwanda.
[02:43:42.229 --> 02:43:48.953]  They don't even allow GMOs to be grown there, and they're getting a lot of pressure to be from their neighboring countries to grow it and from Monsanto.
[02:43:48.953 --> 02:43:49.173]  And it's
[02:43:49.693 --> 02:44:16.420]  You know, going to those countries that people think like people are starving and people are really worse off without GMOs, going there and actually visiting and seeing how they farm and seeing what they're doing is really inspiring because not only do they have an amazing biodiversity of so many different crops, not just corn and soy and canola, but like everything under the sun from cabbage to avocados to carrots and everything being grown there that they can, I mean, they're like
[02:44:16.980 --> 02:44:23.610]  They're absolutely had the most rich soil and I can't even imagine the devastation that would happen.
[02:44:23.610 --> 02:44:26.014]  Sweet potatoes, roses, most of the roses you get are from Africa.
[02:44:27.864 --> 02:44:40.551]  I mean, yeah, I mean, I can't even imagine the devastation that would happen if they started this monoculture type crops there that would just degrade the soil time after time and just strip it of all this amazing nutrients.
[02:44:40.551 --> 02:44:45.774]  And so it's really inspiring to see some of these countries like fight back and say no to Monsanto.
[02:44:45.774 --> 02:44:47.795]  And it's really great that that's happening.
[02:44:48.935 --> 02:45:01.703]  We're like, you know, what's really crazy to me is that we are one of the countries that has the most rights out of any citizens across the globe, and the right that we don't have is the right to know what's in our food.
[02:45:01.703 --> 02:45:02.984]  And they go beyond that, though.
[02:45:02.984 --> 02:45:14.592]  They'll ban our right to know what's in our food with the DARK Act, which passed the House and is now going to be voted on next month by the Senate, which says, literally, mandatory labeling of GMOs will be illegal.
[02:45:14.972 --> 02:45:17.774]  And that was pushed by the very representatives that are paid off.
[02:45:17.774 --> 02:45:21.357]  Yeah, that's in case a state does have a referendum and says, no, we're going to label.
[02:45:21.357 --> 02:45:22.838]  The feds are saying, no, you can't.
[02:45:22.838 --> 02:45:23.859]  Which Texas may do.
[02:45:23.859 --> 02:45:26.381]  I mean, Vermont already has it mandatory GMO labeling.
[02:45:26.381 --> 02:45:31.785]  So this will be the feds coming in and saying, no, you're not allowed to know if GMOs are in your food, period.
[02:45:31.785 --> 02:45:33.026]  And this is likely going to be fast.
[02:45:33.226 --> 02:45:37.749]  Everyone needs to know if their senator votes for that, that they are complete traitors to American rights.
[02:46:03.226 --> 02:46:06.188]  And the Africans used to love the West when they saw the Western medicine man.
[02:46:22.439 --> 02:46:33.707]  Uh, you know, 60, 70, 80 years ago, but now the African leaders say, we know you're stacking traits in there with your Terminator genetics and others that are going to end our agriculture.
[02:46:33.707 --> 02:46:41.752]  And the Africans are reading statements to shareholders from 10 years ago and more from Monsanto admitting the plan is a genetic monopoly.
[02:46:41.752 --> 02:46:45.455]  So the Africans understand we get seeds out of what we plant over and over again.
[02:46:45.455 --> 02:46:47.336]  You're conquering us with this.
[02:46:47.336 --> 02:46:48.457]  We don't want it.
[02:46:48.457 --> 02:46:51.719]  And then our media goes, dumb Africans don't want our free food.
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:55.762]  Well, yeah, because they take the vaccines and get sterilized.
[02:46:55.762 --> 02:47:00.287]  They've already experienced how wondrous it all is to be under this.
[02:47:00.287 --> 02:47:02.229]  They don't want to be destroyed.
[02:47:02.229 --> 02:47:09.696]  And they also attack the Argentinians, because the Argentinian children would develop these massive tumors being around the Monsanto GMO soy fields and things like that.
[02:47:09.696 --> 02:47:13.259]  And they'd always say, oh, they're crazy, they're third world idiots, they don't know what they're talking about.
[02:47:13.259 --> 02:47:15.101]  The villagers, they believe in myths.
[02:47:15.101 --> 02:47:16.543]  They think their gods are doing it.
[02:47:16.963 --> 02:47:23.565]  Yeah, they actually accused them of mishandling their chemicals, right?
[02:47:23.565 --> 02:47:25.345]  Like, mishandling their chemicals.
[02:47:25.345 --> 02:47:34.487]  Like, first of all, if the chemical is harmless, I mean, it's just so ridiculous what they've done to an entire population of farmers.
[02:47:34.487 --> 02:47:35.967]  Sure, the truth is it gets in the well water.
[02:47:35.967 --> 02:47:37.548]  It gets in the well water.
[02:47:37.548 --> 02:47:37.648]  Yeah.
[02:47:38.578 --> 02:47:39.759]  Anthony, what was that part you were going to finish?
[02:47:39.759 --> 02:47:41.021]  Yeah, so this is a new study.
[02:47:41.021 --> 02:47:42.102]  We've got a bunch of studies today.
[02:47:42.102 --> 02:47:43.904]  It seems like a new one comes out every day.
[02:47:43.904 --> 02:47:44.325]  Study.
[02:47:44.325 --> 02:47:49.170]  Children exposed to GMO soy pesticides suffer serious genetic damage.
[02:47:49.170 --> 02:47:55.397]  A 2015 study has shown that children exposed to pesticides used to grow GM soy suffer serious genetic damage.
[02:47:55.397 --> 02:47:56.379]  Research for... Wait a minute.
[02:47:56.379 --> 02:47:58.461]  You mean weed killer might not be good for my children?
[02:47:58.561 --> 02:47:59.901]  Yeah, who would have thought, right?
[02:47:59.901 --> 02:48:00.602]  Oh, you're crazy.
[02:48:00.602 --> 02:48:01.402]  You're insane.
[02:48:01.402 --> 02:48:02.882]  The Argentinians are crazy.
[02:48:02.882 --> 02:48:15.306]  Researchers from the National University of Rio Cuarto, Cordoba, compared children who lived close to a GM soy field growing area in Argentina to children who lived in another city in Cordoba that was not adjacent to GM soy fields.
[02:48:15.306 --> 02:48:21.008]  Genetic damage in the group of exposed children was 44% higher than in the unexposed children.
[02:48:21.408 --> 02:48:28.911]  Living less than 500 meters from crops, routinely sprayed with glyphosate and other pesticides, they had serious, serious genetic damage.
[02:48:28.911 --> 02:48:29.451]  Amazing.
[02:48:29.451 --> 02:48:31.953]  And we're going to be back in the next segment and finish up with these news items.
[02:48:31.953 --> 02:48:34.934]  Before we do that, I wanted to have Vani Hari, the food babe, finish up.
[02:48:34.934 --> 02:48:37.815]  Launching her new initiative last week, already having an effect.
[02:48:37.815 --> 02:48:39.676]  Last week, you wrote an article, Drudge picked it up.
[02:48:40.496 --> 02:48:40.897]  I don't know.
[02:49:03.900 --> 02:49:07.945]  Get the biggest, as you said, fast food chain out there in the U.S.
[02:49:07.945 --> 02:49:10.568]  at least, Subway, to get the antibiotics out of their meat.
[02:49:11.311 --> 02:49:18.756]  Yeah, you know, 23,000 people die every single year in the United States, 700,000 worldwide because of this issue.
[02:49:18.756 --> 02:49:24.479]  Because of superbugs, we're being exposed to it in our water, in our soil, and in our food.
[02:49:24.479 --> 02:49:36.187]  And we really have an obligation as consumers, as humans, to protect antibiotics so that when we want to have them, when we want to use them to fight off superbugs or any type of bugs,
[02:49:36.687 --> 02:49:38.549]  We should be able to do that.
[02:49:38.549 --> 02:49:42.093]  And right now, we're in situations where that's just not possible.
[02:49:42.093 --> 02:49:45.276]  A million Americans are affected every single year by this issue.
[02:49:45.276 --> 02:49:51.782]  My dad personally was affected by this issue, was, you know, was affected by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
[02:49:51.782 --> 02:49:54.825]  By the way, when you use that number, you're using their number.
[02:49:54.825 --> 02:49:56.327]  I mean, it's a lot higher than that.
[02:49:56.980 --> 02:49:58.821]  Yeah, well, yeah, I am using their number.
[02:49:58.821 --> 02:50:02.983]  So who really knows what the real figure is and what they might be hiding from us.
[02:50:02.983 --> 02:50:07.625]  But I'll tell you this, you know, I was talking to the former general of the U.S.
[02:50:07.625 --> 02:50:12.847]  Army, Wesley Clark, at the Democratic National Convention a few years ago.
[02:50:12.847 --> 02:50:16.389]  And he said to me, I said to him, you know, what's the biggest food issue for you?
[02:50:16.389 --> 02:50:17.309]  And this is a U.S.
[02:50:17.309 --> 02:50:18.010]  Army guy, right?
[02:50:18.490 --> 02:50:18.730]  More
[02:50:33.829 --> 02:50:37.712]  We need to see a capitulation to life and join the life wing, not the death wing.
[02:50:37.712 --> 02:50:38.693]  Food Babes, thank you so much.
[02:50:38.693 --> 02:50:39.354]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:50:39.354 --> 02:50:39.674]  We'll be back.
[02:50:39.674 --> 02:50:39.934]  Stay with us.
[02:50:39.934 --> 02:50:40.535]  Fourth Hour coming up.
[02:50:59.091 --> 02:51:05.173]  So I say to Mark at lunch, look, you know, I keep hearing from the government that, you know, they're worried someday ISIS may get here.
[02:51:05.173 --> 02:51:11.015]  Then I go, duh, Garland, Texas, Mohammed cartoon shooting, ISIS is already here.
[02:51:11.015 --> 02:51:13.195]  I'm not waiting for these people to defend me.
[02:51:13.195 --> 02:51:17.577]  If they don't know ISIS is here already, they got no clue, I'm taking care of myself.
[02:51:17.577 --> 02:51:22.478]  Guns80.com, AR-15 kits, 30 shot magazines, great prices.
[02:51:22.478 --> 02:51:24.119]  They've even got the Hillary special.
[02:51:24.119 --> 02:51:25.339]  Guns80.com, that's 844-2Guns80, Guns80.com.
[02:51:29.002 --> 02:51:32.825]  Just recently, we've witnessed some of the most catastrophic disasters in history.

[02:51:39.450 --> 02:51:43.272]  Of course, we're talking about the foods from SurvivalFoodAlliance.com.

[02:52:28.257 --> 02:52:29.477]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:52:29.477 --> 02:52:33.979]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:52:33.979 --> 02:52:39.660]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:52:39.660 --> 02:52:43.221]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:52:43.221 --> 02:52:45.942]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:52:45.942 --> 02:52:50.943]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[02:53:12.296 --> 02:53:16.319]  We'll also never store your credit card information and email address on a computer.
[02:53:16.319 --> 02:53:18.621]  Your email address will never be shared or sold.
[02:53:18.621 --> 02:53:20.762]  We'll never limit the number of boxes you can purchase.
[02:53:20.762 --> 02:53:24.185]  We'll never use outside packers or use relabeled food from another company.
[02:53:24.605 --> 02:53:33.093]  Our meals are naturally high in fiber, carbs and protein and everything is packed with oxygen absorbers and Mylar pouches under our direct supervision at our plant in Oregon.

[02:53:51.193 --> 02:53:51.914]  That's 30dayfoodsupply.com at 800-700-2184.
[02:54:08.473 --> 02:54:19.420]  Well, I made the big announcement towards the end of the last hour, and the video breaking it down, the call to arms of the InfoWars, is at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:54:19.420 --> 02:54:20.981]  Please retweet it.
[02:54:20.981 --> 02:54:23.463]  Please post it to your Facebook, send out your email.
[02:54:23.463 --> 02:54:24.704]  We'll be broadcasting 27 hours live.
[02:54:27.194 --> 02:54:45.730]  Coming up on the 16th and 17th, and I haven't done one of these in three years, because we were able to expand, build the new studios, hire more crew, with the revenue coming in from the sales at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, PrisonPlanet.tv subscriptions, and outside advertising.
[02:54:47.759 --> 02:54:51.462]  The country's in free fall, advertising revenues down across the board.
[02:54:51.462 --> 02:54:55.344]  We already saw this years ago, moved into direct sales with high quality products.
[02:54:55.344 --> 02:55:02.109]  So we're doing okay in the face of this depression, but really don't have the money to expand and finish going on television.
[02:55:04.588 --> 02:55:06.529]  This will reach incredible amounts of people.
[02:55:06.529 --> 02:55:08.350]  This is the best bang for the buck.
[02:55:08.350 --> 02:55:15.315]  It'll be self-funding once we get on more TV stations, UHF, VHF, which are already turning us on.
[02:55:15.315 --> 02:55:18.276]  It's officially, I haven't announced the coordinates and done the rollout yet.
[02:55:18.276 --> 02:55:21.378]  I'll do that on the 16th, but stations are already there.
[02:55:21.378 --> 02:55:23.920]  It's already happening, so I want to thank them.
[02:55:23.920 --> 02:55:26.801]  But people understand, used to this sound like a hardcore show.
[02:55:26.801 --> 02:55:28.783]  Now, people go, I guess this stuff's true.
[02:55:28.783 --> 02:55:30.584]  We better put it on air.
[02:55:30.584 --> 02:55:31.905]  There's no problem getting viewers.
[02:55:32.793 --> 02:55:39.598]  Imagine you watch mainstream television normally, you're flipping through and you come to a three-hour show of this, or the nightly news.
[02:55:39.598 --> 02:55:42.520]  People are like, what in tarnations is this?
[02:55:42.520 --> 02:55:47.204]  There's a big report out today that mainstream TV ratings are yet down again.
[02:55:47.204 --> 02:55:49.185]  Even sports has plateaued.
[02:55:49.185 --> 02:55:51.547]  And they say it's going to alternative media.
[02:55:51.547 --> 02:55:52.888]  All that means is competition.
[02:55:54.025 --> 02:55:57.246]  And we are the biggest slice of that competition.
[02:55:57.246 --> 02:55:58.566]  And we're here to shake things up.
[02:55:58.566 --> 02:56:00.527]  And what we do goes a long way.
[02:56:00.527 --> 02:56:02.267]  So check out that video.
[02:56:02.267 --> 02:56:02.827]  Big announcement.
[02:56:02.827 --> 02:56:09.589]  InfoWars plan to take the InfoWars to the next level and to wake up 400 million people revealed.
[02:56:09.589 --> 02:56:11.790]  Please help us get that out to everybody.
[02:56:11.790 --> 02:56:13.010]  I have barely plugged today.
[02:56:13.010 --> 02:56:15.130]  Didn't plug last hour.
[02:56:15.130 --> 02:56:17.451]  Plugged for maybe one minute in the first hour.
[02:56:17.451 --> 02:56:20.492]  I'm the worst at actually plugging and trying to fund us.
[02:56:21.933 --> 02:56:29.463]  Speaking of drug-resistant bugs and stuff, I personally have my backup Coil Silver Bullet at m4warslife.com.
[02:56:33.186 --> 02:56:36.668]  One of our hottest products, methylcobalamin, vitamin B12.
[02:56:36.668 --> 02:56:38.249]  That's 10% off right now.
[02:56:38.249 --> 02:56:40.371]  You talk about clean, good energy.
[02:56:40.371 --> 02:56:41.171]  That's what it does for me.
[02:56:41.171 --> 02:56:45.314]  Briefly, Anthony Gucciardi, before we go to break, come back with five minutes on more news.
[02:56:45.314 --> 02:56:54.060]  Then Joe Biggs, Jakari Jackson are coming in with some huge breaking intel on the situation in Houston and the war on police that the White House is running.
[02:56:54.060 --> 02:56:56.481]  Tell us why Secret 12 is so special.
[02:56:56.481 --> 02:56:57.342]  Paul, I take some.
[02:56:57.862 --> 02:57:13.964]  Secret 12 is awesome because it's methylcobalamin, which is the medical grade B12 that you would usually inject into yourself, but obviously you don't inject it, you take it under the tongue, and then it has adenosylcobalamin, which are two of the most bioavailable, bioactive forms of B12, and there's a ton of it in it.
[02:57:13.964 --> 02:57:15.165]  It's mega bang for your buck.
[02:57:15.646 --> 02:57:18.847]  I mean, just to get into it, it's 41,000% of daily value.
[02:57:18.847 --> 02:57:23.108]  So this is a super form of B12 that is super powerful, super vital.
[02:57:23.108 --> 02:57:24.368]  And it's not synthetic, it's alive.
[02:57:24.368 --> 02:57:25.368]  Yeah, it's not synthetic.
[02:57:25.368 --> 02:57:26.228]  I've tried the synthetics.
[02:57:26.228 --> 02:57:28.189]  There's no sugar in it, it's the sweetest thing you've ever tasted.
[02:57:28.189 --> 02:57:33.690]  Yes, it is pure B12, methylcobalamin, adenosylcobalamin, powerfully bioactive.
[02:57:33.690 --> 02:57:35.610]  And I've tried the synthetics.
[02:57:35.610 --> 02:57:38.831]  I've even tried the injectable synthetics just to see the difference.
[02:57:38.831 --> 02:57:42.832]  And I can tell you, the synthetics make me feel lethargic, make me feel gross.
[02:57:42.832 --> 02:57:43.492]  We did it together!
[02:57:44.272 --> 02:57:46.933]  We went and saw one medical doctor, I went and saw another.
[02:57:46.933 --> 02:57:49.213]  One of them gave you synthetic, the other one gave you real.
[02:57:49.213 --> 02:57:50.514]  Cyanic Mahleman, yeah.
[02:57:50.514 --> 02:57:52.634]  Which is literally made from cyanide, by the way.
[02:57:52.634 --> 02:57:55.055]  A derivative, a base of it.
[02:57:55.055 --> 02:57:56.315]  So anyway... It did nothing for me.
[02:57:56.315 --> 02:57:57.675]  It made me feel like crap.
[02:57:57.675 --> 02:57:59.516]  But this actually makes me feel good.
[02:57:59.516 --> 02:58:02.157]  Remember, you had ten bottles of it they gave you and you threw away nine.
[02:58:02.157 --> 02:58:03.877]  Yeah, I don't even want those.
[02:58:03.877 --> 02:58:05.157]  And they're expensive, too.
[02:58:05.157 --> 02:58:07.418]  The injectable stuff you get from the doctor is like a hundred dollars.
[02:58:08.218 --> 02:58:11.482]  This is 10% off right now on InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:58:11.482 --> 02:58:12.082]  I use it every day.
[02:58:12.082 --> 02:58:14.985]  You just put it in my protein shaker, you put it in a glass of water, it'll take it right away.
[02:58:14.985 --> 02:58:17.288]  Yeah, you get a bigger effect under the tongue, but I just put it in water.
[02:58:18.814 --> 02:58:21.795]  I mean, it's amazing, and this is a product we never really push or promote it.
[02:58:21.795 --> 02:58:22.216]  It's true.
[02:58:22.216 --> 02:58:24.657]  It's already one of the top sellers, because... It sells anyway.
[02:58:24.657 --> 02:58:29.339]  Because people try it and they go, oh my gosh, no one has ever put out a vitamin B12 we know like this.
[02:58:29.339 --> 02:58:32.100]  No, it's absolutely the most bioavailable out there.
[02:58:32.100 --> 02:58:32.480]  I love it.
[02:58:32.480 --> 02:58:33.381]  I take it every single day.
[02:58:33.381 --> 02:58:36.342]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:58:36.342 --> 02:58:38.763]  And that's what funds the operation.
[02:58:38.763 --> 02:58:39.364]  We'll be back.
[02:58:39.364 --> 02:58:39.864]  Stay with us.

[03:00:17.181 --> 03:00:20.562]  We are back live, final segment I'm going to be hosting with Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:00:20.562 --> 03:00:25.343]  Then, Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson are coming into the studio to break down
[03:00:26.943 --> 03:00:29.285]  The race war in the media is starting.
[03:00:29.285 --> 03:00:34.149]  And now, police chiefs, sheriffs and others are saying this is the White House running this.
[03:00:34.149 --> 03:00:48.522]  Which is good, because it's true, that means they may back off, but it lets you know what a reckless, crazy, revolutionary government we've got, run by a bunch of billionaires, that wants to have some class warfare breakdown where we all kill each other.
[03:00:48.522 --> 03:00:51.605]  Do you think America is dumb enough to buy into this, Anthony?
[03:00:52.236 --> 03:00:54.377]  I don't think America is dumb enough to buy into it.
[03:00:54.377 --> 03:01:02.901]  I think a lot of Americans are force-fed an ideology they don't even believe in, but they think everyone else believes in it, so they want to fit in with the pack, with the herd.
[03:01:02.901 --> 03:01:05.522]  But what they don't realize is it's a facade.
[03:01:05.522 --> 03:01:06.582]  It's artificial facade.
[03:01:06.582 --> 03:01:10.684]  It's an artificial mind prison that is pushed like that video you played earlier from MTV.
[03:01:10.684 --> 03:01:11.845]  That's absolutely insane.
[03:01:11.845 --> 03:01:13.525]  No one in their right mind would agree with that.
[03:01:13.525 --> 03:01:16.267]  I think if you polled people, 99% would disagree.
[03:01:16.267 --> 03:01:19.128]  But they see it on TV, they think it's big, they think it's cool.
[03:01:19.748 --> 03:01:28.014]  They think they're in the movie Entourage, where everyone is just in LA, and it's awesome, and Hollywood's cool, and everyone's so cool, and we want to be- Meanwhile, Hollywood is collapsing.
[03:01:28.014 --> 03:01:30.276]  Yeah, meanwhile, it's totally disgusting over there.
[03:01:30.276 --> 03:01:31.517]  They don't realize that though.
[03:01:31.517 --> 03:01:32.417]  It's a facade.
[03:01:32.417 --> 03:01:33.318]  They want to be part of it.
[03:01:33.318 --> 03:01:35.920]  They don't want to be looked at by their peers as an outcast.
[03:01:35.920 --> 03:01:38.262]  That's why so many people are afraid to voice their actual views.
[03:01:38.262 --> 03:01:39.823]  I mean, if you went to a grocery store,
[03:01:40.103 --> 03:01:43.165]  How uncomfortable would you feel saying, hey, sir, that's GMO.
[03:01:43.165 --> 03:01:44.886]  You know, most people would never do that.
[03:01:44.886 --> 03:01:47.787]  They know it's bad, but they don't want to be outcast by people.
[03:01:47.787 --> 03:01:49.728]  By the way, I see a pregnant woman with her husband on the street.
[03:01:49.728 --> 03:01:51.629]  I stop and say, look into vaccines.
[03:01:51.629 --> 03:01:52.670]  I've seen you do it.
[03:01:52.670 --> 03:01:54.411]  Read the insert.
[03:01:54.411 --> 03:01:55.712]  And my family kind of gets tired of it.
[03:01:55.712 --> 03:01:58.073]  They go, oh my gosh, can you just stop?
[03:01:58.073 --> 03:01:58.573]  They used to.
[03:01:58.573 --> 03:02:00.134]  Now they get it, and they warn people.
[03:02:00.134 --> 03:02:01.435]  You tell everybody.
[03:02:01.435 --> 03:02:02.075]  That's the difference.
[03:02:02.075 --> 03:02:04.436]  You're willing to talk to anybody, and I'm willing to talk to most people, too.
[03:02:04.436 --> 03:02:05.297]  Well, here's the thing.
[03:02:06.570 --> 03:02:10.615]  If I'm late or something, I won't do it, but I am not aiding and abetting the enemy.
[03:02:10.615 --> 03:02:17.302]  I don't want to spend my time and warn somebody and have them laugh at me or whatever, but I gotta do it to help them, or it's on me.
[03:02:17.302 --> 03:02:21.587]  I mean, if I knew people were drinking some poison out of a well, I'd have to tell them it was poison in it.
[03:02:21.667 --> 03:02:25.932]  Well, it's always weird when we talk to people because you'll be like, hey, that fluoride is bad for you and that type of stuff.
[03:02:25.932 --> 03:02:26.793]  That's not true.
[03:02:26.793 --> 03:02:28.675]  You'll reference studies from Harvard and everything.
[03:02:28.675 --> 03:02:29.596]  That can't be true.
[03:02:29.596 --> 03:02:31.718]  And then they look it up and they freak out.
[03:02:31.718 --> 03:02:36.664]  People either don't know or they just pretend to be part of the ideology that's been pushed.
[03:02:36.664 --> 03:02:38.985]  Exactly, and by the way, I'm not in people's business.
[03:02:38.985 --> 03:02:42.086]  I hear gunshots at the neighbor's house or whatever, you know, out in the country.
[03:02:42.086 --> 03:02:44.688]  I don't call the cops.
[03:02:44.688 --> 03:02:51.090]  I mind my own business, but it's my business if people are poisoning themselves because it's going to come back on me and my family.
[03:02:51.090 --> 03:02:52.591]  I have a responsibility to warn people.
[03:02:52.691 --> 03:02:57.677]  Well, how about if you let your kids hang out with some other family and they serve a bunch of junk to them or, you know, give them whatever.
[03:02:57.677 --> 03:03:00.341]  Say, oh, you should go take your vaccinations and do this and this and this.
[03:03:00.341 --> 03:03:01.983]  It is your business.
[03:03:01.983 --> 03:03:03.345]  My children go to a great school.
[03:03:03.345 --> 03:03:08.251]  You know, they were homeschooled for a long time, but they wanted to play sports and things, so they got to a nice little private school.
[03:03:08.251 --> 03:03:10.133]  Great people, but still, some of the kids there...
[03:03:10.934 --> 03:03:13.937]  Tell them, oh, you don't take vaccines, you're going to die.
[03:03:13.937 --> 03:03:16.000]  It's illegal not to take vaccines.
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:17.421]  It just shows the brainwashing.
[03:03:17.421 --> 03:03:17.821]  Right.
[03:03:17.821 --> 03:03:18.983]  From the other kids.
[03:03:18.983 --> 03:03:22.947]  It doesn't even matter whether or not we're going to talk about the health issues of the vaccinations.
[03:03:22.947 --> 03:03:24.949]  It's your choice to do it or not do it.
[03:03:24.949 --> 03:03:28.433]  But overall, I think people don't buy into any of these ideologies.
[03:03:28.433 --> 03:03:30.395]  I don't think people buy into that MTV video.
[03:03:30.655 --> 03:03:37.876]  I think it's just contrived and it makes it seem like everyone thinks it's true when it's on television because it's a magic box illuminated in front of you.
[03:03:37.876 --> 03:03:38.396]  Sure.
[03:03:38.396 --> 03:03:43.877]  And the government is saying that cops inherently are racist and want to kill everybody.
[03:03:43.877 --> 03:03:48.958]  Again, mindlessly applying it to a group, setting the standard that the media is God.
[03:03:48.958 --> 03:03:53.499]  Just like Obama says, I'm going to Alaska, I'm going to change the name of a mountain.
[03:03:53.499 --> 03:03:55.179]  Since when can the president do that?
[03:03:55.179 --> 03:03:58.180]  Since when does the first lady tell us what our kids need at school?
[03:03:58.880 --> 03:04:01.701]  And I bet that guy that killed the cop is going to have something to say about it.
[03:04:01.701 --> 03:04:03.522]  Oh, you know, well, Black Lives Matter.
[03:04:03.522 --> 03:04:06.924]  Remember that one guy that was tried for, like, raping a woman or whatever?
[03:04:06.924 --> 03:04:08.205]  And he's like, Black Lives Matter.
[03:04:08.205 --> 03:04:11.206]  Well, another guy killed the two white kids and then said the same thing.
[03:04:11.206 --> 03:04:12.167]  It's totally insane.
[03:04:12.167 --> 03:04:12.767]  It means nothing.
[03:04:12.767 --> 03:04:15.468]  But they think that they have people on their side with that, when in reality, they don't.
[03:04:15.468 --> 03:04:21.591]  Well, it's like the Klan getting filled with the same rhetoric, but just against another group, would think, well, this is a black guy, so I had to lynch him.
[03:04:21.591 --> 03:04:22.452]  Yeah.
[03:04:22.452 --> 03:04:23.152]  It wasn't black.
[03:04:23.152 --> 03:04:24.513]  I mean, it's a white cop.
[03:04:24.513 --> 03:04:25.133]  I had to shoot him.
[03:04:25.393 --> 03:04:26.735]  It's artificial racism.
[03:04:26.735 --> 03:04:27.776]  It's not even there.
[03:04:27.776 --> 03:04:29.498]  There's not even real racism right now.
[03:04:29.498 --> 03:04:36.525]  It's all artificial in the sense, there's obviously real racism, but the race war artificial mindset of Black Lives Matter and all that is contrived.
[03:04:36.525 --> 03:04:41.191]  Well, that's coming up, and they've got the clips, the latest pigs in a blanket, fry them up, pigs with wings.
[03:04:41.191 --> 03:04:44.194]  They've got it all, Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs, and we break it down.
[03:04:44.194 --> 03:04:46.577]  And they have a police officer coming on, he's running for sheriff.
[03:04:47.217 --> 03:04:49.121]  Uh, who, a former Marine.
[03:04:49.121 --> 03:04:51.224]  He's been endorsed by a lot of Patriots.
[03:04:51.224 --> 03:04:53.989]  Uh, this guy could be the next, uh, David Clark.
[03:04:53.989 --> 03:04:57.135]  And he's gonna be joining us coming up in about 30 minutes, so stay with us.
[03:04:59.895 --> 03:05:02.496]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[03:05:02.496 --> 03:05:03.596]  Get back to nature.

[03:06:59.042 --> 03:07:05.707]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:07:05.707 --> 03:07:13.834]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:07:13.834 --> 03:07:21.680]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:27.083]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:07:27.083 --> 03:07:32.305]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[03:07:32.305 --> 03:07:36.647]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[03:07:36.647 --> 03:07:37.728]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:07:37.728 --> 03:07:42.250]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[03:07:47.133 --> 03:07:49.654]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[03:08:01.857 --> 03:08:08.499]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:08.499 --> 03:08:11.480]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:14.562 --> 03:08:17.505]  And welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:17.505 --> 03:08:20.888]  Myself, Jakari Jackson, Joe Biggs, here riding shotgun.
[03:08:20.888 --> 03:08:27.113]  Alex is bringing back the fourth hour, so this is a great way to inform you, to inform your local stations.
[03:08:27.113 --> 03:08:34.199]  If they don't carry it, you may give them a call, say, hey, you guys may want to pick this up and find out what's going on over at InfoWars.com.
[03:08:34.199 --> 03:08:35.441]  Now, coming up a little bit,
[03:08:36.141 --> 03:08:36.361]  I think?
[03:09:06.082 --> 03:09:08.625]  It's coming up very soon, the 16th, 17th.
[03:09:08.625 --> 03:09:12.430]  It's going to be a 24-hour, excuse me, 27-hour broadcast.
[03:09:12.430 --> 03:09:14.433]  I'm going to be on, of course, Joe Biggs.
[03:09:14.433 --> 03:09:24.646]  I'm really interested to see what Joe Biggs is going to say, because he does a lot of kind of co-hosting, but when you get into that host chair, Joe, what do you think you're going to be talking about?
[03:09:25.609 --> 03:09:27.831]  Well, I'm going to try to get some exciting guests on.
[03:09:27.831 --> 03:09:34.736]  I've got three hours to cover, and it's going to be during the peak hours of midnight to 3 a.m., so it should be interesting.
[03:09:34.736 --> 03:09:37.157]  Those are always the interesting hours.
[03:09:37.157 --> 03:09:43.022]  I'm sure we're going to get some very interesting callers coming in with some highly entertaining topics to discuss.
[03:09:43.022 --> 03:09:49.406]  Yeah, that midnight to 3, or I guess pretty much that midnight to around 5 or 6, you get very interesting callers.
[03:09:49.406 --> 03:09:50.367]  I mean, on anything.
[03:09:50.367 --> 03:09:54.230]  If you have a local radio station, those are always the people who come in and have very
[03:09:54.890 --> 03:09:55.831]  Interesting things to say.
[03:09:55.831 --> 03:09:57.111]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:09:57.111 --> 03:09:58.152]  So it will be fun.
[03:09:58.152 --> 03:10:09.639]  And like I said, we're trying to raise a million dollars so we can reach 400 million and essentially help widen this broadcast so we can reach more people, get more people awake, so they can find out what's going on.
[03:10:09.639 --> 03:10:12.360]  And it's amazing the amount of people we're already reaching at this point in time.
[03:10:12.360 --> 03:10:19.324]  Just imagine the 400 million people getting informed on a daily basis about what's going on in the world.
[03:10:19.324 --> 03:10:22.106]  Truly, not the lies that the mainstream media is telling you.
[03:10:22.606 --> 03:10:27.349]  And it's very exciting because we've seen a lot of growth on Twitter, on Facebook, on YouTube.
[03:10:27.349 --> 03:10:31.571]  The Alex Jones Channel is growing and we definitely encourage you to subscribe to that.
[03:10:31.571 --> 03:10:33.272]  But enough of all that.
[03:10:33.272 --> 03:10:35.194]  Joe, let's talk about some of the issues that are going on.
[03:10:35.194 --> 03:10:38.495]  I know we're talking a little bit off camera about some gun issues.
[03:10:38.495 --> 03:10:40.737]  And we have this article that's on InfoWars.com.
[03:10:40.737 --> 03:10:42.518]  It's one of the top articles.
[03:10:42.518 --> 03:10:44.159]  New York Times Barrow.
[03:10:44.159 --> 03:10:47.461]  Massive gun grab, the only way to impact violent crime.
[03:10:48.001 --> 03:10:55.426]  So, you know Joe, as much as these people, these gun grabbers say that we don't want to take your guns, they're saying right here, we want to take your guns.
[03:10:55.426 --> 03:11:06.934]  Just like, you weren't there but it was before you worked here, we went out to the Alamo and Alex gave that speech, and they said nobody's trying to take your guns, why simultaneously handing you a flyer saying let's ban assault weapons.
[03:11:06.934 --> 03:11:11.257]  And it's like, we don't want to take your guns, like it says here on this paper that you want to take our guns away.
[03:11:11.357 --> 03:11:14.598]  Well, the interesting thing about it is the growth of social media.
[03:11:14.598 --> 03:11:21.839]  The fact that people are so informed quickly now about what's going on versus how it used to be before, you know, Twitter, Facebook, all that.
[03:11:21.839 --> 03:11:28.220]  So it seems like there's a lot more gun violence going on, when in actuality, a lot of the stuff's pretty much the same.
[03:11:28.220 --> 03:11:31.561]  It's just that now everyone's got a camera or a phone with a camera in it.
[03:11:31.561 --> 03:11:38.543]  Everyone can upload to Twitter really quick, Instagram, whatever it may be, and get something out that normally people wouldn't even hear about or be covered in the news.
[03:11:38.543 --> 03:11:40.123]  But because social media is so strong,
[03:11:40.743 --> 03:11:46.591]  These outlets are being forced to cover these different shooting scenarios and things like that.
[03:11:46.591 --> 03:11:55.943]  And of course you're going to have people out there like Virginia try to use an incredibly horrible situation that happened and hijack it to use it to push gun control.
[03:11:56.483 --> 03:12:04.368]  Yes, because, just that point you brought up, what used to be a local news story can easily become a national, if not international, news story overnight.
[03:12:04.368 --> 03:12:15.514]  And it's very unfortunate that these incidents happen, but when you have a situation like, I think it was back in 2012, a 12-year-old Oklahoma girl, somebody broke into her home, she was home alone, she shot the guy, that wasn't
[03:12:15.734 --> 03:12:21.419]  You know, international news that a young lady used a firearm to defend herself, or any of these other situations.
[03:12:21.419 --> 03:12:26.083]  And I know you know this very well, with this recent shooting at the recruiting offices.
[03:12:26.083 --> 03:12:39.055]  You know, yes, that did get a lot of media attention, but they quickly dropped it because they didn't want to talk about that this building full of highly trained men weren't able to protect themselves, and the gun-free zone sign on the door didn't stop a single bullet that I'm aware of.
[03:12:39.500 --> 03:12:53.345]  Yeah, and then you have the Department of the Army coming out releasing statements saying that it's a security threat for patriots, for people to go out there and stand guard because they feel it's their obligation as an American citizen to go out and help protect the ones that aren't able to protect themselves.
[03:12:53.345 --> 03:12:58.147]  It's just like if you're driving down the road and you see someone being beat, you're going to pull over and help that person.
[03:12:58.147 --> 03:13:01.468]  It's so ridiculous, Joe, when we're talking about the people who can't protect themselves.
[03:13:01.468 --> 03:13:03.248]  These are our military men and women.
[03:13:03.248 --> 03:13:03.568]  Exactly.
[03:13:03.568 --> 03:13:04.529]  They shouldn't be a soft target.
[03:13:05.229 --> 03:13:05.990]  Why are we making them though?
[03:13:05.990 --> 03:13:07.471]  It blows my mind.
[03:13:07.471 --> 03:13:17.379]  And when we went out there, you spent more time than I did, but we went out there and people's wives would come up to us and say, hey, my husband can't come out here and say anything to you officially, but I just want to say I really appreciate it.
[03:13:17.379 --> 03:13:22.603]  They were trying to buy us donuts and pizzas and wanted to take us out, you know, wherever, to the steakhouse.
[03:13:22.603 --> 03:13:22.783]  Yeah.
[03:13:23.803 --> 03:13:35.608]  But you know it's interesting, there's another article up right now actually by Steve Watson at Infowars.com, poll 60% of Americans against more gun control, more than two-thirds say shootings are a mental problem.
[03:13:35.608 --> 03:13:44.752]  And that's one of the big issues, is the fact that there is a mental problem going on, that you have these doctors who push these psychotropic drugs and they don't ever have to
[03:13:45.851 --> 03:13:50.318]  To be responsible for those actions of those drugs, the adverse reactions.
[03:13:50.318 --> 03:13:52.661]  I used to have to take that stuff when I was in the military.
[03:13:52.661 --> 03:13:53.963]  It made me suicidal.
[03:13:53.963 --> 03:13:55.946]  It made me crazy out of my mind.
[03:13:55.946 --> 03:13:59.050]  And the day that I flushed that stuff down the toilet, I never once
[03:14:00.399 --> 03:14:00.739]  I don't know.
[03:14:25.216 --> 03:14:25.916]  Slingshots?
[03:14:25.916 --> 03:14:28.077]  Yeah, whatever works.
[03:14:28.077 --> 03:14:30.438]  Banning the gun is not going to eliminate the problem.
[03:14:30.438 --> 03:14:38.820]  I just saw this article today, I can't recall if it was on drugs or not, but it was about a woman who drowned two of her kids in a bathtub and the third one escaped and got away.
[03:14:38.820 --> 03:14:40.441]  Are you going to ban the bathtub now?
[03:14:40.441 --> 03:14:41.001]  Of course not.
[03:14:41.001 --> 03:14:44.102]  You understand that this was an incident of a mentally ill person.
[03:14:44.102 --> 03:14:50.444]  I don't know if she was on drugs or not, but a mentally ill person who used whatever was in her means to commit her offense.
[03:14:50.444 --> 03:14:52.685]  I mean, yeah, just imagine a world where there are no guns.
[03:14:53.598 --> 03:14:57.160]  Back in biblical times, when there wasn't anything like that, Cain and Abel.
[03:14:57.160 --> 03:14:58.080]  Use a rock.
[03:14:58.080 --> 03:15:10.166]  I mean, someone's gonna find someone, someone has ill intentions, someone has hate in their heart, and they really want to cross that line from sanity to just going, you know, bat crazy and doing something.
[03:15:10.166 --> 03:15:10.646]  They'll do it.
[03:15:10.646 --> 03:15:14.748]  If there's no gun, they're gonna, I mean, you could literally, I could use this microphone and just bludgeon someone with it.
[03:15:15.228 --> 03:15:17.870]  So, I mean, will we ban microphones after that?
[03:15:17.870 --> 03:15:24.213]  And we had the article, I think it was a couple years ago, that blunt objects like hammers and baseball bats were killing record numbers of people.
[03:15:24.213 --> 03:15:25.114]  FBI's own number.
[03:15:25.114 --> 03:15:29.716]  You're more likely to be stabbed to death than shot with a real assault rifle.
[03:15:29.716 --> 03:15:30.857]  You know, at least in this country.
[03:15:31.667 --> 03:15:34.550]  Yeah, I just don't get people's logic when it comes to that.
[03:15:34.550 --> 03:15:38.674]  When one of these tragedies happens, people start thinking with their emotions.
[03:15:38.674 --> 03:15:45.221]  They're not using facts, they're not sitting back and going, alright, how is this going to affect us as a country if we really do try to ban guns?
[03:15:45.221 --> 03:15:52.087]  Now you're taking someone's right to protect themselves, their property, and their family away from them because of a few bad people out there who've made
[03:15:52.828 --> 03:15:53.929]  I don't think so.
[03:16:11.002 --> 03:16:14.105]  At the same numbers with firearms, these crimes are still happening.
[03:16:14.105 --> 03:16:21.712]  And the flip side of that, you look at someplace like Mexico, where it has very low civilian gun ownership, but the cartels obviously didn't get that memo.
[03:16:21.712 --> 03:16:26.236]  They're riding around with guns, you know, hanging journalists from flagpoles and doing all types of crazy things.
[03:16:26.236 --> 03:16:27.637]  Yeah, criminals love gun control.
[03:16:27.637 --> 03:16:30.240]  And that's all that's going to do is give them an edge in the game.
[03:16:30.700 --> 03:16:30.960]  Yeah.
[03:16:30.960 --> 03:16:34.444]  You're going to give them that upper hand that they need to continue to go out and do stuff.
[03:16:34.444 --> 03:16:42.993]  Because if I'm a criminal and I'm sitting down in my car driving through and I'm going to, you know, do a home invasion, if I know everyone on this block doesn't have a gun, I'm going to feel pretty good.
[03:16:42.993 --> 03:16:43.894]  My odds are pretty good.
[03:16:43.894 --> 03:16:45.576]  This guy might have a baseball bat.
[03:16:45.576 --> 03:16:47.318]  I might have to do a couple ducking and dodging.
[03:16:47.318 --> 03:16:50.661]  But at the end of the day, if I can dodge that first swing, I can, you know, put a round in.
[03:16:51.562 --> 03:16:53.523]  So that's how they're going to think.
[03:16:53.523 --> 03:17:02.507]  I need to be, I want to know that when I'm at home and I hear something bang or knock over and the door open up, I can go out there, have my firearm and be responsible.
[03:17:02.507 --> 03:17:09.451]  I don't have to shoot the guy, but I can at least show that gun and make that guy rethink his decision about coming into my home and turn away.
[03:17:10.071 --> 03:17:12.614]  Yeah, and that's what a lot of times people forget.
[03:17:12.614 --> 03:17:13.955]  It is a deterrent.
[03:17:13.955 --> 03:17:20.261]  You don't always have to shoot the guy because they go out and they watch James Bond shoot somebody 300 yards away with a little PPK.
[03:17:20.261 --> 03:17:22.363]  I mean, it doesn't really work like that in real life.
[03:17:22.363 --> 03:17:27.288]  You know, you can just pull a gun out on somebody who's entering your home and they say, whoa, it's really not that serious anymore.
[03:17:28.280 --> 03:17:30.981]  Yeah, they're going to rethink their life decisions at that point in time.
[03:17:30.981 --> 03:17:33.702]  They're going to find God really quick, and they're going to get out of there.
[03:17:33.702 --> 03:17:34.062]  Yeah.
[03:17:34.062 --> 03:17:39.104]  And they're going to, hopefully, make the right decision to never do that again, because they've been given a second chance.
[03:17:39.104 --> 03:17:43.506]  You know, everyone thinks that if you have this gun, you're going to automatically just be pulling the trigger.
[03:17:43.506 --> 03:17:48.607]  I have a gun with me all the time, and I don't have any desire to wave it around, do anything.
[03:17:48.607 --> 03:17:55.230]  It's there purely for my protection, and if I were to see something happen, like an active shooter situation, and I was there, and I had my concealed,
[03:17:56.078 --> 03:18:03.304]  I can help the situation out, because when seconds count, some police officers aren't going to be able to be there until after it's too late, and then there's a body count.
[03:18:03.304 --> 03:18:08.168]  Yeah, and that's not knocking the police, that's just saying they can't be everywhere at every time.
[03:18:08.168 --> 03:18:16.576]  And what you're talking about, people with these firearms, one of the big arguments against open carry is that if it's legal, everybody's going to do it.
[03:18:16.576 --> 03:18:20.959]  Well, my home state of Oklahoma passed it back in 2013, I believe is when it became law.
[03:18:22.100 --> 03:18:26.443]  And when I go home, you know, Christmas or, you know, summertime, I went here in May.
[03:18:26.443 --> 03:18:32.646]  I've seen, since it passed in 2013, two people open carry who weren't police officers.
[03:18:32.646 --> 03:18:33.587]  It's not some big deal.
[03:18:33.587 --> 03:18:38.670]  You know, if you want to, I'm glad you have that right to do so, but it's not the thing that everybody's going to run out and do it.
[03:18:39.192 --> 03:18:42.373]  Yeah, I mean, I have the ability to open carry all over the place, but I mean, I don't do it.
[03:18:42.373 --> 03:18:43.153]  I use good judgment.
[03:18:43.153 --> 03:18:47.835]  I mean, we do a lot of open carry marches, you and I, and a lot of the people around here in Texas.
[03:18:47.835 --> 03:18:55.698]  It's more for opening dialogue with people, people who don't quite understand anything about guns.
[03:18:55.698 --> 03:18:59.619]  We can use that as a platform when we go out there and we walk around.
[03:19:00.259 --> 03:19:01.279]  And we use good judgment.
[03:19:01.279 --> 03:19:02.720]  You know, we don't have our hands on the trigger.
[03:19:02.720 --> 03:19:04.521]  It's at the low ready, pointed down.
[03:19:04.521 --> 03:19:06.902]  We're not having it up in the air, the muzzle flashing around.
[03:19:06.902 --> 03:19:08.863]  You know, we're trying to do the right thing.
[03:19:08.863 --> 03:19:11.744]  We engage in conversation and speak to people about the Second Amendment.
[03:19:11.744 --> 03:19:15.505]  At the end of the day, we usually open up a lot of eyes and inform a lot of people on subjects like that.
[03:19:15.505 --> 03:19:21.968]  Yeah, because I guess there's a lot of stigma from people who haven't actually been to one of these rallies or actually seen it in their cities.
[03:19:21.968 --> 03:19:23.269]  So, you know, somebody in, you know, L.A.
[03:19:23.269 --> 03:19:25.390]  or whatever has never encountered something like this.
[03:19:25.390 --> 03:19:27.530]  They think it's, you know, people running in fear for their lives.
[03:19:27.530 --> 03:19:28.291]  I mean, I've been to
[03:19:29.031 --> 03:19:31.832]  Conservative number 20 open carry rallies.
[03:19:31.832 --> 03:19:34.133]  I've never seen anybody run in fear for their life.
[03:19:34.133 --> 03:19:39.056]  There's some people who may cross the street, but nobody runs up and like, the world's about to end.
[03:19:39.056 --> 03:19:40.356]  None of that's going on.
[03:19:40.356 --> 03:19:47.439]  So when we come back, not this break, but the next break, we'll have the sheriff, Carl Pittman, or the sheriff candidates.
[03:19:47.439 --> 03:19:50.721]  So stay tuned for this and so much more coming up on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:50.721 --> 03:19:52.982]  I'm Jakari Jackson sitting here with Joe Biggs.

[03:21:58.736 --> 03:22:02.321]  Okay, honey, I have to ask and be honest here.
[03:22:02.321 --> 03:22:03.844]  Have you been taking a little blue pill?
[03:22:05.043 --> 03:22:07.384]  You've been pretty good in the bedroom lately.
[03:22:07.384 --> 03:22:09.224]  No, I swear.
[03:22:09.224 --> 03:22:13.065]  You didn't pick anything up at the Pharmacia last month in Cancun?
[03:22:13.065 --> 03:22:13.805]  No.
[03:22:13.805 --> 03:22:15.586]  Well, something's different.
[03:22:15.586 --> 03:22:18.586]  I have been taking that heart and body extract you bought me.
[03:22:18.586 --> 03:22:20.987]  But that's for your heart and to control your cholesterol.

[03:24:18.254 --> 03:24:23.257]  Well, I want to give a real quick plug for Supermail.
[03:24:23.257 --> 03:24:31.281]  Now, this is a product that I personally use on a daily basis, so it's really done a lot for me.
[03:24:31.281 --> 03:24:35.083]  I remember the first day I actually took it, I didn't really know what to expect.
[03:24:35.083 --> 03:24:37.144]  I was like, eh, we'll see what happens.
[03:24:37.144 --> 03:24:39.646]  You know, I don't really ever, I never really took supplements much.
[03:24:40.859 --> 03:24:44.523]  But let me tell you, this stuff is phenomenal.
[03:24:44.523 --> 03:24:48.808]  When I took it, I mean, immediately, the energy set in.
[03:24:48.808 --> 03:24:54.113]  And as far as libido goes, I was definitely impressed with that.
[03:24:54.113 --> 03:24:59.739]  And let's just say the old lady at the house was very pleased with super male vitality, just as much as I was.
[03:25:00.874 --> 03:25:04.396]  I definitely say it's something worth stinking your dollars in.
[03:25:04.396 --> 03:25:06.937]  It definitely helps support the operation.
[03:25:06.937 --> 03:25:12.499]  And it gives you and I the ability to go out and do these trips, cover these different tours.
[03:25:12.499 --> 03:25:19.022]  Yeah, these different events because, you know, as many trips that we go on, especially you, Joe, there's many we don't get to cover.
[03:25:19.022 --> 03:25:20.502]  And people ask, why don't you guys cover this?
[03:25:20.502 --> 03:25:21.443]  Why don't you cover that?
[03:25:21.443 --> 03:25:24.144]  You know, we go as time and finances allow.
[03:25:24.144 --> 03:25:26.825]  And when you go and you purchase something like Supermail Vitality,
[03:25:27.225 --> 03:25:27.645]  We're good to go.
[03:25:46.036 --> 03:25:49.799]  When people automatically, when they come up to me, it's not just like, hey Joe Biggs or whatever like that.
[03:25:49.799 --> 03:25:50.740]  It's like, hey man, look at this.
[03:25:50.740 --> 03:25:52.382]  And they pull out of their pocket.
[03:25:52.382 --> 03:25:55.805]  You'll see like the ladies will pull this out of their purse or the guys out of their pockets.
[03:25:55.805 --> 03:25:59.228]  Like, hey man, I just wanted to show you that, you know, we support what you're doing.
[03:25:59.228 --> 03:26:00.068]  We're using this.
[03:26:00.068 --> 03:26:03.491]  It's tremendously helped us in many ways, you know, with, you know.
[03:26:04.232 --> 03:26:05.153]  The family in general.
[03:26:27.108 --> 03:26:27.428]  We're good.
[03:26:44.216 --> 03:26:45.417]  So definitely check that out.
[03:26:45.417 --> 03:26:47.379]  Infowarshop.com.
[03:26:47.379 --> 03:26:51.924]  Now we have this clip that we alluded to earlier, the New York Times Burrow.
[03:26:51.924 --> 03:26:54.146]  Whenever the guys are ready, we can run that clip.
[03:26:54.146 --> 03:26:58.290]  And this is basically a clip of, we hear all these people saying, we don't want to ban your guns.
[03:26:58.290 --> 03:26:59.832]  This is somebody saying, we want to ban your guns.
[03:26:59.932 --> 03:27:00.693]  That's not just this guy.
[03:27:00.693 --> 03:27:02.055]  I mean, he's some some pundit.
[03:27:02.055 --> 03:27:14.070]  I mean, but you have people like Feinstein, you have guys like Bloomberg and everybody else Holder running these things, and they say they want to take your guns away or brainwash you into thinking about your firearms in a drastically different way.
[03:27:14.070 --> 03:27:15.011]  So I believe we have that clip.
[03:27:15.011 --> 03:27:16.233]  Let's go ahead and take a look.
[03:27:17.352 --> 03:27:19.594]  Hillary Clinton made her comments about gun reform.
[03:27:19.594 --> 03:27:20.354]  What do you make of that?
[03:27:20.354 --> 03:27:21.595]  I'll start with you, Josh.
[03:27:21.595 --> 03:27:25.397]  Well, I mean, it's what I would expect a Democratic presidential candidate to say.
[03:27:25.397 --> 03:27:31.600]  But, you know, if Hillary Clinton becomes president, she will be a president facing a Republican House, at least, possibly also a Republican Senate.
[03:27:31.600 --> 03:27:37.724]  So, you know, I don't think that there will be significant change in gun policy if Hillary Clinton is president.
[03:27:37.724 --> 03:27:40.965]  I mean, we already have a Democratic president now, and we haven't had significant change on it.
[03:27:40.965 --> 03:27:45.768]  But I would also note, the things that we talk about in the United States are so at the margins on this stuff.
[03:27:46.088 --> 03:27:48.649]  I wonder about how much they would really impact gun violence.
[03:27:48.649 --> 03:27:58.994]  If you did something like Australia did, where you really take away massive amounts of guns that people have, reduce the rate of gun ownership substantially in society, you could have a big impact on violent crime.
[03:27:58.994 --> 03:28:05.296]  But, I mean, changes with background checks will help at the margin, but I wouldn't expect that to have big impacts.
[03:28:05.296 --> 03:28:08.038]  Well, didn't this last shooter pass a background check?
[03:28:08.038 --> 03:28:13.020]  He went to a retail store, a local gun retail store, like an Academy Sports or whatever it may be.
[03:28:13.860 --> 03:28:25.944]  Went through the exact paperwork that I would have to go to, you just recently purchased... Yeah, and more to that, you were there, you were witness to this, I just bought a Glock at a gun show, what was it, two weeks ago, and I sat down there and did paperwork.
[03:28:25.944 --> 03:28:32.526]  This gun show loophole, you can go, I went in there, I have a concealed carry license, and I had to fill out paperwork for this firearm.
[03:28:32.526 --> 03:28:38.908]  Yeah, exactly, I watch you fill it out, they call it in, they make sure that everything's copacetic, everything's good, the call comes back through,
[03:28:39.940 --> 03:28:40.400]  You're good to go?
[03:28:40.400 --> 03:28:41.080]  Yeah.
[03:28:41.080 --> 03:28:46.362]  I mean, so, you know, the Virginia mayor coming out saying that we need these stiffer background checks.
[03:28:46.362 --> 03:28:47.963]  I mean, that's not going to do anything.
[03:28:47.963 --> 03:28:52.584]  At the end of the day, all you're going to do when they do a massive gun sweep, you know what's going to affect?
[03:28:52.584 --> 03:28:54.485]  You and I, the law-abiding citizens.
[03:28:54.485 --> 03:28:56.626]  It's not going to affect the criminals who are going to get in and out.
[03:28:56.626 --> 03:29:00.227]  Nobody's coming to take your guns like they didn't do it door to door during Hurricane Katrina.
[03:29:00.907 --> 03:29:07.349]  ABC News, you can go Google that right now and see how they have the police and National Guard going door-to-door taking people's houses.
[03:29:07.349 --> 03:29:12.791]  I think they even punched some old lady in the face to get her little revolver or whatever she had on her.
[03:29:12.791 --> 03:29:14.371]  Just completely ridiculous.
[03:29:14.371 --> 03:29:15.692]  And am I saying it's imminent?
[03:29:15.692 --> 03:29:16.852]  Is it going to happen next week?
[03:29:16.852 --> 03:29:19.513]  No, I'm not anticipating that to happen next week.
[03:29:19.513 --> 03:29:26.475]  I'm just saying it has happened before and that's not something we want to see happen again, especially with the massive data that they're trying to collect.
[03:29:26.815 --> 03:29:27.516]  So stay tuned.
[03:29:27.516 --> 03:29:29.677]  Coming up after this break we'll have Carl Pittman.
[03:29:29.677 --> 03:29:32.859]  He's running for a sheriff down in Harris County.
[03:29:32.859 --> 03:29:35.441]  That's in the Houston area, so stay tuned for that.
[03:29:35.441 --> 03:29:36.782]  We'll be back more after this.
[03:29:36.782 --> 03:29:48.510]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:48.510 --> 03:29:49.911]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.911 --> 03:29:52.433]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.433 --> 03:29:55.135]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.601 --> 03:30:07.882]  If you're worried about your health, and you're tired of the nasty side effects of harsh drugs or antibiotics, then look no further.
[03:30:07.882 --> 03:30:10.703]  Supernatural Silver is the answer.

[03:30:59.827 --> 03:31:03.912]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[03:31:03.912 --> 03:31:14.385]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[03:31:14.385 --> 03:31:17.309]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[03:31:17.449 --> 03:31:26.233]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[03:31:26.233 --> 03:31:28.094]  This is the good halogen.
[03:31:28.094 --> 03:31:31.156]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[03:31:31.156 --> 03:31:43.161]  Now we at Infowarslife.com are bringing you the only source of clean, pure 99.99 Ultra Pure Deep Earth Crystals from more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.

[03:31:59.389 --> 03:32:02.350]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[03:32:02.350 --> 03:32:06.491]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[03:32:06.491 --> 03:32:08.772]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[03:32:08.772 --> 03:32:13.934]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[03:32:13.934 --> 03:32:15.754]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[03:32:15.754 --> 03:32:17.295]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[03:32:17.295 --> 03:32:18.775]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[03:32:18.775 --> 03:32:21.816]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[03:32:22.136 --> 03:32:27.519]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[03:32:27.519 --> 03:32:36.843]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights and measures.
[03:32:36.843 --> 03:32:39.204]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[03:32:39.204 --> 03:32:40.585]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[03:32:45.267 --> 03:32:45.767]  I think so.
[03:33:14.381 --> 03:33:16.323]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.323 --> 03:33:17.664]  This is the fourth hour.
[03:33:17.664 --> 03:33:19.845]  Jakari Jackson along with Joe Biggs.
[03:33:19.845 --> 03:33:23.328]  This is going to become a regular thing, so we definitely thank you for joining us.
[03:33:23.328 --> 03:33:28.993]  And if you don't have the fourth hour in your community, go ahead and give your local radio station a call and say, hey, we want you guys to pick this up.
[03:33:29.773 --> 03:33:32.215]  Now we have Mr. Carl Pittman.
[03:33:32.215 --> 03:33:34.816]  He is a sheriff candidate down in Harris County.
[03:33:34.816 --> 03:33:38.738]  That's in the Houston area, a very short section of his biography.
[03:33:38.738 --> 03:33:43.701]  He joined the United States Marine Corps in July of 1981 as an infantry marine.
[03:33:43.701 --> 03:33:49.745]  He also had experience as a black and hispanic, with the black and hispanic gangs and the Mexican mafia.
[03:33:49.745 --> 03:33:51.026]  This is investigating them.
[03:33:51.366 --> 03:33:56.388]  And it led him to become a California Superior Court qualified expert on gangs and narcotics.
[03:33:56.388 --> 03:33:59.230]  This is just a very short section of his biography.
[03:33:59.230 --> 03:34:01.470]  We definitely thank him for joining us today.
[03:34:01.470 --> 03:34:02.351]  How you doing today, Carl?
[03:34:02.972 --> 03:34:04.093]  I'm doing excellent.
[03:34:04.093 --> 03:34:05.113]  How are you gentlemen doing?
[03:34:05.113 --> 03:34:05.633]  Great.
[03:34:05.633 --> 03:34:07.234]  Very well, very well.
[03:34:07.234 --> 03:34:19.800]  So, before we get into anything else, we know that we had this shooting that happened just this past weekend, very unfortunate, a very cowardly act to walk up to somebody and shoot them when they weren't expecting it at the gas station of all places.
[03:34:19.800 --> 03:34:23.461]  So, what is your initial reaction to that, Carl?
[03:34:23.461 --> 03:34:28.684]  Well, you know, I, being a professional peace officer, I've learned not to jump to conclusions,
[03:34:30.202 --> 03:34:42.752]  The very best thing that we can make out of this is this was just a callous, cowardly act and apparently targeted at Deputy Goforth for the very reason that he was simply wearing a uniform.
[03:34:44.059 --> 03:34:44.660]  That's right.
[03:34:44.660 --> 03:34:51.165]  And, you know, we've reported a lot on police brutality, other things going on in the country, and I always try to put that disclaimer out there.
[03:34:51.165 --> 03:34:53.807]  When I talk about police, I'm not talking about all police officers.
[03:34:53.807 --> 03:35:00.852]  I say that this officer that did this particular action of these officers, that may be the case, but it's not all law enforcement.
[03:35:00.852 --> 03:35:06.797]  And even for those officers that I have an issue with, it's no means to go up and shoot somebody in the back of the head.
[03:35:06.797 --> 03:35:11.201]  You know, that's definitely not the type of recourse that we want to see going on in our communities.
[03:35:11.721 --> 03:35:20.163]  Now Carl, so tell us a little bit about yourself and what makes you want to run for the Sheriff's Office down in the Houston area?
[03:35:20.163 --> 03:35:27.225]  Well, you know, to cut straight to the chase, I believe our country is in deep, deep trouble.
[03:35:27.225 --> 03:35:33.526]  And it is in deep trouble because many of our leaders have completely ignored the Constitution.
[03:35:34.469 --> 03:35:38.775]  And we are watching this from Washington and trickle down through government.
[03:35:38.775 --> 03:35:40.297]  We've seen this happen.
[03:35:40.297 --> 03:35:50.669]  As you mentioned in my bio there, I am a veteran United States Marine, and I took an oath a long time ago, actually, when I was just 17 years old.
[03:35:52.191 --> 03:36:04.548]  That to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and to provide, you know, this idea that we
[03:36:05.550 --> 03:36:09.956]  In America have taken for granted everything we have.
[03:36:09.956 --> 03:36:11.819]  And I think we've gotten soft.
[03:36:11.819 --> 03:36:14.663]  And I think we need to return to law and order.
[03:36:14.663 --> 03:36:22.374]  And I think that if we do these things, we have a great opportunity to salvage America and bring it back again.
[03:36:22.793 --> 03:36:33.903]  Yeah, we have this generation of entitlement that's coming up now, where people feel like they should just be given everything, no one really wants to work hard for anything, and people just want to complain and, you know, everything needs to be politically correct.
[03:36:33.903 --> 03:36:39.789]  People are afraid to kind of get up and stand up for something and really be what an American is truly all about.
[03:36:39.789 --> 03:36:40.710]  Okay.
[03:36:42.213 --> 03:36:43.473]  That's exactly right.
[03:36:43.473 --> 03:36:47.754]  Now, Mr. Pittman, so you're a law enforcement officer.
[03:36:47.754 --> 03:36:59.497]  Is there anything that you see in the country, as far as how certain situations have been reacted to, you know, namely Ferguson or any other place around the country, that you would, if you had the power, you would change?
[03:36:59.497 --> 03:37:07.478]  As far as maybe engaging the public, use of tear gas, rubber bullets, is that an all-purpose thing in your opinion, or what are your thoughts on that?
[03:37:07.478 --> 03:37:10.139]  Well, you know, I think long before it comes to that, I think
[03:37:11.821 --> 03:37:25.612]  Leadership in law enforcement must develop relationships with the public so we start to change this mentality that police officers are out there to simply harm them and put them in jail.
[03:37:25.612 --> 03:37:34.259]  You know, some of the ideas that I have is working with youngsters so that they never see the doors of our jails because I think that's a success.
[03:37:35.159 --> 03:37:40.161]  There are some people out there that, regardless of what we do, we're not going to make them happy.
[03:37:40.161 --> 03:37:46.364]  And so, of course, they're going to be anti-law enforcement, and that's just the way it is.
[03:37:46.364 --> 03:37:48.805]  But we never shy away from doing our duties.
[03:37:48.805 --> 03:37:57.168]  So, you know, if we have an option that we can remedy a situation without using deadly force, we surely ought to use that.
[03:37:57.168 --> 03:37:59.629]  There's no doubt in my mind about that.
[03:37:59.629 --> 03:38:03.711]  Our desire is not to harm anyone, and surely not to kill anyone.
[03:38:04.471 --> 03:38:13.016]  Uh, but so often, uh, the people that we deal with dictate how these, uh, incidents come to a conclusion.
[03:38:13.016 --> 03:38:23.902]  Now, what things are being done, if any, about this, uh, so-called just black radical group calling for the killing of cops that this apparently happened just a couple of days prior to, uh, Officer Goforth being executed?
[03:38:23.902 --> 03:38:26.023]  Do you know anything about that?
[03:38:26.023 --> 03:38:28.224]  Well, you know, I, I don't know which, uh,
[03:38:29.028 --> 03:38:40.957]  Group you're speaking of, but I can tell you, you know, as listening to various things, you know, Minister Louis Farrakhan has literally called for the execution of whites.
[03:38:40.957 --> 03:38:48.123]  The new Black Panther Party has surely talked about going out and hurting and harming and killing police officers.
[03:38:49.163 --> 03:38:52.024]  You know, this is the society that we live in.
[03:38:52.024 --> 03:38:56.945]  And because we've watched lawlessness has become accepted.
[03:38:56.945 --> 03:39:03.206]  Even in the White House, you know, we have a president that is not willing to stand up for law and order.
[03:39:03.206 --> 03:39:05.547]  And that is a sad, sad thing.
[03:39:05.547 --> 03:39:08.208]  And so I think we're going to see more of this.
[03:39:08.208 --> 03:39:14.009]  But as a leader, and here in Harris County, it would surely be something that I will do as sheriff.
[03:39:14.609 --> 03:39:23.561]  And something I do just in my normal activities, you go out and you talk to people, you develop relationships, and you know, there has to be an element of trust.
[03:39:23.561 --> 03:39:32.112]  If the community doesn't trust the police and the police don't trust the community, you're going to have these types of things happen and they're going to happen more and more frequently.
[03:39:32.773 --> 03:39:34.635]  Yeah, that's kind of what we noticed in Ferguson.
[03:39:34.635 --> 03:39:43.003]  There was a lack of that leadership, boots on the ground by the police officers talking with the protesters at the beginning when we first got there, right Jakari?
[03:39:43.003 --> 03:39:43.244]  Yes.
[03:39:43.244 --> 03:39:51.112]  You saw these guys rolling up in MRAPs and, you know, they've got all their tactical gear on and then you're sitting there, you know, with, you know, shorts on and flip-flops.
[03:39:51.112 --> 03:39:54.775]  The next thing you know you've got a laser dot on your chest from a sniper on top of an MRAP.
[03:39:55.376 --> 03:39:58.319]  I mean, you back someone into a corner like that, people are going to act out of control.
[03:39:58.319 --> 03:40:08.030]  So, I mean, I think it's a great idea that you need to, as a police officer, to get out there and try to mingle with the crowds, talk to the people in your community, and try to build a better rapport.
[03:40:09.210 --> 03:40:09.870]  Absolutely.
[03:40:09.870 --> 03:40:15.732]  And these things happen long in advance of an incident like we've seen happen around the country.
[03:40:15.732 --> 03:40:21.394]  You know, law enforcement has in all of the ways that we have progressed over the years.
[03:40:21.394 --> 03:40:23.615]  I came into this business in 1985, 30 years ago this summer.
[03:40:26.116 --> 03:40:32.159]  And, you know, we've come through community-oriented policing, which is very relevant and valid today.
[03:40:32.159 --> 03:40:37.841]  But we have to be the ones who extend a hand.
[03:40:37.841 --> 03:40:40.482]  And again, everybody's not going to want to work with us.
[03:40:40.482 --> 03:40:47.685]  Everybody's not going to want to return our desire to make peace when we can.
[03:40:47.685 --> 03:40:51.047]  But what law enforcement cannot do is shy away from their duties.
[03:40:51.968 --> 03:40:59.318]  And fail to do what is required of them because if we don't, we can easily lose society.
[03:40:59.318 --> 03:41:04.485]  You know, I was a police sergeant in Southern California when the Rodney King riots happened.
[03:41:04.485 --> 03:41:07.530]  And I can tell you that is not something we want to see here in Houston.
[03:41:08.393 --> 03:41:14.659]  That's good, that's very good to know because that was quite the scene out there with the Rodney King incident.
[03:41:14.659 --> 03:41:21.286]  Now, Mr. Pittman, I have some issues here from your website and it says you have a tough stand against illegal immigration.
[03:41:21.286 --> 03:41:26.751]  Do you have any type of policies that you would like to implement or anything that you would like to see done to stem that?
[03:41:26.751 --> 03:41:32.297]  Well, you know, when you ask if whether I have policies in place, you know, peace officers are
[03:41:33.340 --> 03:41:39.707]  Restricted to the laws that our legislators give us in order to solve these problems.
[03:41:39.707 --> 03:41:41.488]  And there are plenty of laws on the books.
[03:41:41.488 --> 03:41:50.678]  The problems is that a lot of because of government bureaucracy and red tape, you know, officers and agencies aren't
[03:41:51.562 --> 03:41:52.722]  Doing what they should do.
[03:41:52.722 --> 03:41:59.204]  The city of Houston here, quite frankly, is on every list that you can find that talks about sanctuary cities.
[03:41:59.204 --> 03:42:00.484]  Houston is on it.
[03:42:00.484 --> 03:42:01.865]  And why is that happening?
[03:42:01.865 --> 03:42:09.486]  Police officers in the city of Houston are prohibited from doing certain things when it comes to dealing with illegal aliens.
[03:42:09.486 --> 03:42:12.047]  And so, you know, we will enforce the law.
[03:42:12.799 --> 03:42:28.571]  And I will, through the Department, excuse me, through the Office of the Sheriff, when elected, I will work with and hope that our legislators here in Texas will give us some of the things that we need legislatively to deal with this problem.
[03:42:28.571 --> 03:42:33.194]  Because if we don't, we're going to lose what we know America is.
[03:42:33.194 --> 03:42:41.100]  And that would be a sad thing when you think of all those who came before us who have died and suffered and offered up so much if we lose it.
[03:42:42.145 --> 03:42:42.626]  That's right.
[03:42:42.626 --> 03:42:46.490]  And also, I see on here, the Sheriff Pittman posse.
[03:42:46.490 --> 03:42:51.555]  What exactly is it that says it's a thousand man plus volunteer posse?
[03:42:51.555 --> 03:42:56.401]  Well, you know, so often, so much of America and so many communities
[03:42:57.327 --> 03:43:01.868]  There's this belief that it's the police versus the public.
[03:43:01.868 --> 03:43:07.449]  And there is no better situation that when you can get people engaged in their government.
[03:43:07.449 --> 03:43:22.673]  And the Posse is simply will be a supplement to everything else we do, whether it's going out to help us look for a lost child, whether it's going out and working public events and partner them up with certified law enforcement officers.
[03:43:22.673 --> 03:43:23.513]  But it is a way
[03:43:24.093 --> 03:43:35.382]  To bring people in from every single corner of this community and have them be involved so they take ownership in not only the Sheriff's Office but their community.
[03:43:35.382 --> 03:43:39.025]  What are your thoughts on Sheriff David Clark out of Minnesota?
[03:43:39.025 --> 03:43:45.811]  His comments, I believe it was yesterday on Fox, where he called Black Lives Matter, Black Lies Matter.
[03:43:45.811 --> 03:43:49.574]  What do you think about this and this movement going on across the country right now?
[03:43:49.574 --> 03:43:52.836]  Well, you know, I'm a pretty fair-minded person and I
[03:43:54.713 --> 03:44:01.157]  Color is not something that I spend a lot of time paying attention to unless I'm shopping for a car or suit.
[03:44:01.157 --> 03:44:04.260]  Everyone needs to be treated equally.
[03:44:04.260 --> 03:44:05.420]  All lives matter.
[03:44:05.420 --> 03:44:13.246]  So to say that a black life is more important than a white life or a brown life, quite frankly, that's just as racist as anything else.
[03:44:13.246 --> 03:44:18.749]  Sure, have there been things in this country perpetrated against black people over the history of this country?
[03:44:18.749 --> 03:44:19.790]  Absolutely.
[03:44:19.790 --> 03:44:23.833]  But I don't think we would be intelligent folks to spend our time
[03:44:24.233 --> 03:44:25.233]  I'm dwelling on that.
[03:44:25.233 --> 03:44:26.754]  We have to move ahead.
[03:44:26.754 --> 03:44:31.375]  We need to be positive and we need to try to solve some of the problems that we can do something about.
[03:44:31.375 --> 03:44:38.717]  And I guarantee you, this rhetoric of Black Lives Matter, because what they're saying is, no other lives do.
[03:44:38.717 --> 03:44:40.338]  All lives matter.
[03:44:40.338 --> 03:44:42.919]  That is my belief as a human being and a Christian.
[03:44:42.919 --> 03:44:43.719]  All lives matter.
[03:44:44.397 --> 03:44:50.244]  It's very interesting because you have a lot of people that kind of say that, you know, racism is just out of control right now in the country.
[03:44:50.244 --> 03:44:52.167]  And I was speaking with an older black gentleman yesterday.
[03:44:52.167 --> 03:44:55.350]  I was hanging out with him at this bar down in Kyle.
[03:44:55.350 --> 03:44:57.613]  And we were talking about he said, you know, 50 years ago,
[03:44:58.553 --> 03:45:05.536]  If you and I wouldn't be able to sit here and have this conversation in a bar together, me as a black guy, you as a white guy, we wouldn't be able to do that.
[03:45:05.536 --> 03:45:16.381]  He said the fact that you and I right now are sharing a drink together, talking about the government, talking about politics, having a good time, not really worried about that, it shows you this country has progressed and moved forward.
[03:45:16.381 --> 03:45:21.644]  So there's a lot of people out there in the mainstream media want to keep pushing this narrative that white people hate black people, black people hate white people.
[03:45:21.644 --> 03:45:25.866]  I've never even thought about it until the last year where that's all you hear on the news.
[03:45:27.165 --> 03:45:32.066]  Well, because, you know, it's a commentary that there are a few people in this country that want to push.
[03:45:32.066 --> 03:45:36.027]  You know, it makes a lot of people money, it keeps a lot of people in fear.
[03:45:36.027 --> 03:45:38.968]  That's a big thing, fear, yeah.
[03:45:38.968 --> 03:45:46.970]  When you think about it, you know, here in Texas and still down in the South, but particularly here in Texas, we have a holiday, Juneteenth, the 19th of June.
[03:45:47.848 --> 03:45:54.214]  And the news of the freedom that had been obtained by slaves reached Galveston, Texas, June 19, 1865.
[03:45:54.214 --> 03:45:57.156]  If my math is right, that's just slightly over 150 years ago.
[03:46:01.630 --> 03:46:11.798]  So for anyone to walk around and still try and accuse someone of slavery or what happened during slavery is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard.
[03:46:11.798 --> 03:46:17.283]  Because I don't think anybody that either was a slave or participated in slavery is still alive today.
[03:46:17.283 --> 03:46:20.285]  So a lot of people just need to grow up.
[03:46:20.285 --> 03:46:22.487]  And sure, we can take ownership of our history.
[03:46:22.487 --> 03:46:23.768]  We need to do that.
[03:46:23.768 --> 03:46:26.790]  And so we make sure that we don't repeat some of these same mistakes.
[03:46:26.790 --> 03:46:27.271]  Exactly.
[03:46:27.951 --> 03:46:44.086]  It is very sad that when I think of it, and I think it's so many people that sacrifice so much from every race, whether it's blacks, whether it's the Asians that came and helped and we built this country, and now we see it being ripped apart over race.
[03:46:44.086 --> 03:46:45.528]  And that is a sad, sad thing.
[03:46:46.374 --> 03:47:01.820]  I want to talk to you about some of the rhetoric, and that's a very good answer there, Sheriff, or potential Sheriff, about some of the rhetoric we've heard around the country about constitutional groups, things coming out of the SPLC, labeling constitutionalists, libertarians, and that matter, terrorists.
[03:47:01.820 --> 03:47:04.861]  Do you share that type of opinion or viewpoint?
[03:47:04.861 --> 03:47:15.145]  Well, I tell you what, you know, if you go back in, you know, the founding of this country, I'm sure the king in England probably called our founding fathers something akin to terrorists.
[03:47:15.626 --> 03:47:35.899]  You know, if we stand up and, you know, the beautiful thing about our government and the way that our, shall I say, our country, you know, the one thing that was not settled at the inception of this country and our founding documents was slavery, but that was taken care of.
[03:47:35.899 --> 03:47:44.925]  And when you think about how far we've come, and yes, we still have a ways to go, to call people who love this country, what I call patriots,
[03:47:46.187 --> 03:47:51.570]  And the government wants to call terrorists or domestic terrorists.
[03:47:51.570 --> 03:47:59.795]  Well, we've seen that if we don't stand up that, you know, you can call me any name you want.
[03:47:59.795 --> 03:48:03.597]  Just don't call me lacking in doing my duty.
[03:48:03.597 --> 03:48:06.839]  And so I'm not I'm not really caught up in names.
[03:48:06.839 --> 03:48:10.701]  I think people that love their country ought to demonstrate it every way they can.
[03:48:12.253 --> 03:48:12.894]  That's right.
[03:48:12.894 --> 03:48:16.956]  Going back to the topics on your website, you have the Second Amendment.
[03:48:16.956 --> 03:48:18.617]  So you have it also quoted here.
[03:48:18.617 --> 03:48:21.619]  So I take it it's very important to you.
[03:48:21.619 --> 03:48:27.363]  So when you see people with their gun rights, things such as open carry, is that something that you frown on?
[03:48:27.363 --> 03:48:29.805]  Or what are your thoughts on that?
[03:48:29.805 --> 03:48:31.646]  I am a strict constitutionalist.
[03:48:32.338 --> 03:48:37.601]  Constitution clearly talks about and says that the right shall not be infringed.
[03:48:37.601 --> 03:48:39.722]  I don't know what is so complicated about that.
[03:48:39.722 --> 03:48:43.144]  I don't think we need to have any drawn-out legal discussion.
[03:48:43.144 --> 03:48:52.650]  The right of freedom-loving, liberty-minded Americans to be armed goes back to the beginning and before the actual beginning of this country.
[03:48:53.170 --> 03:48:58.134]  So, if someone wants to walk around and carry a gun, God bless them.
[03:48:58.134 --> 03:49:07.983]  You know, you so often said in my profession that when something happens and it's, you know, happening in a matter of seconds, it takes the police to get there in minutes.
[03:49:07.983 --> 03:49:11.846]  And so, you know, I don't want to live in a populace of sheep.
[03:49:11.846 --> 03:49:16.250]  I want to live in a populace of people that can help protect themselves and that's what we need to do.
[03:49:16.610 --> 03:49:21.794]  That's what one of the sheriffs, I believe, in Detroit was saying as well, that people need to be armed.
[03:49:21.794 --> 03:49:24.076]  Because like you said, we can't be everywhere at the exact same time.
[03:49:24.076 --> 03:49:25.917]  It's going to take us some time to get there.
[03:49:25.917 --> 03:49:29.841]  And a lot of times, by the time that you're able to get there, things could already have gone wrong.
[03:49:29.841 --> 03:49:33.704]  So it's better for people to be armed and have that right to protect themselves.
[03:49:33.704 --> 03:49:37.126]  There was a guy in Detroit whose car was stolen.
[03:49:37.126 --> 03:49:39.108]  And he had his gun and the guy turned around and
[03:49:40.589 --> 03:49:44.072]  Aimed a vehicle and started coming back at him to run him over.
[03:49:44.072 --> 03:49:50.556]  And he said he saw the guy go for his gun and his vehicle that was just stolen, so the guy was about to run him over and then shoot him out of his own vehicle.
[03:49:50.556 --> 03:49:54.619]  He pulled out, shot the guy, the guy went into a tree and ended the entire thing.
[03:49:54.619 --> 03:49:57.441]  Now if he wouldn't have had that, he could have been ran over.
[03:49:57.441 --> 03:49:59.523]  So it's great to be able to protect yourself.
[03:49:59.523 --> 03:50:00.344]  Yeah.
[03:50:00.344 --> 03:50:01.625]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:50:01.625 --> 03:50:07.989]  Alright, Mr. Pittman, I think we're about to go out to break here in a moment, but we'll be right back after this break.
[03:50:07.989 --> 03:50:08.169]  So,
[03:50:09.555 --> 03:50:10.877]  Final thoughts with this segment.
[03:50:10.877 --> 03:50:16.004]  Was there anything that you want the people to know about you that maybe we didn't touch on?
[03:50:16.004 --> 03:50:18.227]  Well, you know what's important to me?
[03:50:18.227 --> 03:50:23.594]  People love to accuse folks of having all sorts of agendas and reasons why they do things.
[03:50:24.361 --> 03:50:36.891]  My agenda is making sure that we maintain law and order, that we protect and defend the Constitution, because if we don't do that, this experiment known as America is going to fail.
[03:50:36.891 --> 03:50:40.394]  And so, that's my agenda, is making sure that we don't fail.
[03:50:41.485 --> 03:50:45.366]  Sounds like the agenda is liberty and freedom, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[03:50:45.366 --> 03:50:49.207]  All right, Carl Pittman, we'll be back right after this break, so hang tight.
[03:50:49.207 --> 03:50:51.187]  We'll get your final thoughts coming up after this.
[03:50:51.187 --> 03:50:51.687]  Stay tuned.
[03:50:51.687 --> 03:50:53.028]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:50:53.028 --> 03:50:55.408]  Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs in the fourth hour.
[03:51:05.106 --> 03:51:07.127]  Hey neighbor, what are you doing digging?
[03:51:07.127 --> 03:51:08.828]  You had a heart attack last year.
[03:51:08.828 --> 03:51:10.329]  Oh, I know.
[03:51:10.329 --> 03:51:12.250]  I was told no more hard labor.
[03:51:12.250 --> 03:51:13.831]  Then why are you digging?
[03:51:13.831 --> 03:51:15.672]  Well, I've been taking extendovite.
[03:51:15.672 --> 03:51:17.434]  It's been approved to help my heart.
[03:51:17.434 --> 03:51:18.474]  Extendovite?
[03:51:18.474 --> 03:51:19.355]  Is that a new drug?
[03:51:20.205 --> 03:51:21.565]  No, not a drug.
[03:51:21.565 --> 03:51:25.406]  It's more like an herbal combination made from garlic and cayenne.
[03:51:25.406 --> 03:51:26.027]  Herbal?
[03:51:26.027 --> 03:51:27.547]  How can that help?
[03:51:27.547 --> 03:51:32.128]  Well, actually, we've taken herbs for thousands of years, and Xtendivite is doing the job for me.
[03:51:32.128 --> 03:51:34.729]  Does your doctor know about Xtendivite?
[03:51:34.729 --> 03:51:38.310]  Yeah, my doctor knows, and he said it seems to be working for you, so don't stop taking it.
[03:51:38.610 --> 03:51:40.372]  I feel great taking Xtendivite.
[03:51:40.372 --> 03:51:41.533]  I don't want to stop.

[03:54:07.890 --> 03:54:09.712]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:09.712 --> 03:54:13.215]  This is the fourth hour with Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs.
[03:54:13.215 --> 03:54:16.478]  We'll get back to our interview or finish up our interview in just one second.
[03:54:16.478 --> 03:54:20.823]  But before we do that, I want to give you guys a quick testimonial about OxyPowder.
[03:54:20.823 --> 03:54:26.348]  Now, out of all the InfoWars Life products that we have, this is probably the one I take the most regular.
[03:54:26.348 --> 03:54:27.909]  I take it several times a week.
[03:54:28.790 --> 03:54:33.711]  And it basically cleans you out, to put it quite bluntly, anything that's in there.
[03:54:33.711 --> 03:54:41.433]  You know, I like to go eat a lot of good Texas barbecue and a steak dinner, but that's not necessarily something that you want to stick around in your intestines.
[03:54:41.433 --> 03:54:44.413]  So I take the oxy powder and flush all that stuff out.
[03:54:44.413 --> 03:54:45.374]  You know, it's real good.
[03:54:45.374 --> 03:54:50.355]  I definitely recommend that you have time to sit at home if you're going to take it.
[03:54:50.355 --> 03:54:51.335]  Take it at the nighttime.
[03:54:51.335 --> 03:54:52.055]  You take it at nighttime?
[03:54:52.515 --> 03:54:53.175]  I take it at night.
[03:54:53.175 --> 03:54:54.956]  I take it in the morning when I come in.
[03:54:54.956 --> 03:54:57.197]  That explains a lot of it.
[03:54:57.197 --> 03:54:58.057]  It works fast.
[03:54:58.057 --> 03:54:58.897]  It's really good.
[03:54:58.897 --> 03:55:00.097]  It's good and healthy.
[03:55:00.097 --> 03:55:01.378]  Yeah, it's good for you.
[03:55:01.378 --> 03:55:07.500]  It's a real good thing, but I prefer to take it at night while I'm at home because you don't want to be caught out at the grocery store or someplace else.
[03:55:08.860 --> 03:55:14.064]  But whether you take a day or night, it's a good thing to have, and you can get that at theinfowarshop.com.
[03:55:14.064 --> 03:55:17.266]  Now, finishing things up with our guest Carl Pittman.
[03:55:17.266 --> 03:55:21.948]  He is running for Sheriff down in Harris County that is in the Houston area.
[03:55:21.948 --> 03:55:28.472]  So we've been asking a lot of questions here, Carl, and we gave you a chance to expand upon your platform.
[03:55:28.472 --> 03:55:32.495]  Just tell us, you know, anything else people need to know about Carl Pittman.
[03:55:32.495 --> 03:55:37.658]  Well, I will share with you some of the individuals who have endorsed me.
[03:55:38.504 --> 03:55:41.907]  My good friend, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, out in Arizona.
[03:55:41.907 --> 03:55:48.112]  My good friend, Sheriff Richard Mack, who is the founder of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association.
[03:55:48.112 --> 03:55:55.499]  And my good friend, the Second Amendment protector, who will tell you how it is, Ted Nugent.
[03:55:55.499 --> 03:56:01.324]  And many, many other businessmen and people across this state and now across the country.
[03:56:02.219 --> 03:56:05.486]  You know, there's nothing wrong with loving your country.
[03:56:05.486 --> 03:56:07.490]  There's absolutely nothing wrong with it.
[03:56:07.490 --> 03:56:12.641]  If you look around, you know, whether it's your home, your cars, your families, your wealth.
[03:56:13.527 --> 03:56:20.291]  Everything you have could become nothing if we lose our liberties and our freedoms.
[03:56:20.291 --> 03:56:37.960]  So I would just ask everyone to take a real serious look at what's happening in this country and quit using the old idea that you don't want to be involved with politics, because I promise you, whether you want to or not, politics will be involved with you.
[03:56:38.652 --> 03:56:40.152]  That's a very good statement.
[03:56:40.152 --> 03:56:42.633]  Now this is probably going to be one of our last questions.
[03:56:42.633 --> 03:56:49.175]  I want to know what you think is going to happen or where you see things going if we continue to see these assaults on police officers.
[03:56:49.175 --> 03:56:56.157]  We know the recent one in Houston, I believe it was earlier this year, the two officers in a patrol car.
[03:56:56.157 --> 03:56:57.917]  Louisiana as well, I believe.
[03:56:57.917 --> 03:57:00.778]  If these things continue to happen, where do you see all this going?
[03:57:02.113 --> 03:57:05.676]  Well, I surely don't like where it's headed.
[03:57:05.676 --> 03:57:11.180]  And again, you know, it's going to require us to rethink the way we go about doing our business in law enforcement.
[03:57:11.180 --> 03:57:22.008]  You know, there's been a lot of talk as recently as it always seems to pop up when a single officer unit gets attacked that we need to go to multiple, you know, at least two, two officer units.
[03:57:22.008 --> 03:57:24.970]  Well, that's not always financially feasible in every community.
[03:57:24.970 --> 03:57:30.214]  So we've got to rethink our tactics and really take a look at everything we do
[03:57:30.854 --> 03:57:44.806]  But if we don't get this under control, this is going to be one of the worst snapshots in history that when we have literally open hunting season on police officers.
[03:57:44.806 --> 03:57:49.890]  All right, Carl Pittman, can you tell us how we can stay in touch with you and also how anybody else can get in touch with you?
[03:57:50.407 --> 03:58:01.693]  Sure, you can visit my website at www.carlforsheriff.com.
[03:58:01.693 --> 03:58:02.774]  I'd love to hear from you.
[03:58:02.774 --> 03:58:06.056]  Follow me on Facebook and Twitter.
[03:58:06.056 --> 03:58:08.897]  Just get involved, wherever you are, get involved.
[03:58:10.198 --> 03:58:18.686]  I am asking you to stand up wherever you are because the last thing in the world you want to do is find yourself living on your knees.
[03:58:18.686 --> 03:58:20.468]  And quickly, Carl, when is the election?
[03:58:21.446 --> 03:58:23.307]  Our primary is in March.
[03:58:23.307 --> 03:58:27.070]  I believe the actual primary election day is Tuesday, March 1st.
[03:58:27.070 --> 03:58:29.132]  Early voting will start in mid-February.
[03:58:29.132 --> 03:58:32.634]  You know, we have began and we will continue.
[03:58:32.634 --> 03:58:33.034]  Thank you, Carl.
[03:58:33.034 --> 03:58:34.415]  We've got about five seconds left.
[03:58:34.415 --> 03:58:35.776]  Definitely appreciate you, Carl Pittman.
[03:58:35.776 --> 03:58:37.477]  Go check out his site.
[03:58:37.477 --> 03:58:37.998]  Stay tuned.
