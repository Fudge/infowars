[00:00:03.905 --> 00:00:07.607]  Hillary Clinton's constant private email drama has taken on a new level of undeniable criminality.
[00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:08.728]  As the nation's chief diplomat,
[00:00:22.495 --> 00:00:37.808]  Hillary Clinton was responsible for ascertaining whether information in her possession was classified and acknowledged that negligent handling of that information could jeopardize national security, according to a copy of an agreement she signed upon taking the job.
[00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:46.376]  A day after assuming office as Secretary of State, Clinton signed a sensitive compartmented information non-disclosure agreement.
[00:00:46.676 --> 00:00:51.959]  that laid out criminal penalties for any unauthorized disclosure of classified information.
[00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:57.322]  The Competitive Enterprises Institute obtained the contract through an open records request.
[00:00:57.642 --> 00:01:09.988]  The Sensitive Compartmented Information Nondisclosure Agreement details how Hillary has been granted access to Sensitive Compartmented Information, or SCI, classified information.
[00:01:10.188 --> 00:01:15.551]  The agreement states that Hillary hereby acknowledges that the disclosure of SCI may constitute
[00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:16.312]  Bottom line?
[00:01:36.252 --> 00:01:36.512]  U.S.
[00:01:36.552 --> 00:01:47.823]  intelligence officials determined at least four and up to 305 of the emails Hillary's aides printed out were from Hillary's personal server and were SCI at the time they were written.
[00:01:48.183 --> 00:01:53.348]  Two of the emails discussed classified drone information deemed top secret by the CIA.
[00:01:53.808 --> 00:01:57.712]  Hillary's private server was never authorized to be used for SCI.
[00:01:57.952 --> 00:02:01.054]  Hillary claims she didn't know the information was classified.
[00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:02.435]  The New York Post reported,
[00:02:28.092 --> 00:02:44.907]  The agreement states, I understand that it is my responsibility to consult with appropriate management authorities in the department in order to ensure that I know whether information or material within my knowledge or control that I have reason to believe might be SCI.
[00:02:45.367 --> 00:02:45.808]  Busted!
[00:02:46.468 --> 00:02:51.891]  Oh sure, it's a constant distraction from the real issues and most Americans are just sick of hearing about it.
[00:02:52.391 --> 00:03:00.636]  But allowing Hillary to continue her vampiric rise to power would be comparable to electing Richard Nixon after he had been impeached.
[00:03:00.976 --> 00:03:03.817]  People have got to know whether or not their president's a crook.
[00:03:04.558 --> 00:03:05.378]  Well, I'm not a crook.
[00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.500]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:03:08.817 --> 00:03:13.741]  Hillary is a danger to national security, whether she is charged or not.
[00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:16.764]  Clearly, the iron has never been hotter.
[00:03:16.944 --> 00:03:28.914]  If there is any pulse at all in DC, then federal officials will do the job that is required according to this newly released Hillary damning non-disclosure agreement.
[00:03:29.274 --> 00:03:31.196]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:03:38.325 --> 00:03:44.451]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:47.775]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:03:47.795 --> 00:03:49.516]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!

[00:03:55.903 --> 00:04:01.809]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down our pants on the streets?
[00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.691]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
