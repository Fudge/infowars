[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:02.737]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:23.709 --> 00:00:24.470]  Big Brother.
[00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.091]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:27.711]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:28.572 --> 00:00:29.973]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:31.454]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:31.894 --> 00:00:36.557]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:43.257]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, October the 4th, 2015.
[00:00:43.437 --> 00:00:44.939]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.886]  I'm back from covering the martial law events that we had in the Northeast.
[00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:51.508]  I was gone last week.
[00:00:51.528 --> 00:00:54.912]  I had to take a little bit of time and decompress after
[00:00:55.713 --> 00:00:57.594]  That depressing situation.
[00:00:58.234 --> 00:01:01.575]  We covered the politics of what the Pope was selling.
[00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:03.216]  We covered the martial law there.
[00:01:03.736 --> 00:01:06.357]  And I have to say, it just kept getting worse.
[00:01:06.417 --> 00:01:10.958]  It wasn't the amount of time that we were there, but it was what we saw in Philadelphia.
[00:01:11.018 --> 00:01:14.759]  My wife had told me that it was going to be much worse in Philadelphia.
[00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:16.320]  And I said, oh, they all like to brag about
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.921]  What a giant martial law presence they're going to create.
[00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:25.984]  But they shut down that entire city and the saddest thing is the people loved it.
[00:01:26.744 --> 00:01:30.386]  They were just reveling in how safe they were.
[00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:34.828]  You have to understand that the TSA was not there to keep them safe.
[00:01:34.868 --> 00:01:40.511]  The TSA was there to keep them away from the Pope, away from one man.
[00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:41.851]  There to protect one man.
[00:01:41.891 --> 00:01:44.853]  There to protect a government official, if you will.
[00:01:45.353 --> 00:01:46.793]  From another country.
[00:01:46.873 --> 00:02:01.118]  And of course, it's amazing to see in Washington and in New York, where they have the President and the Congress all the time, or the UN, where they had leaders of all these different countries, how they stepped up the protection in the wake of the Pope being there.
[00:02:01.158 --> 00:02:05.299]  So we're going to talk about some of what we saw, some of the politics that was there.
[00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:12.161]  And we had an amazing interview with some people who were part of a network of those who had been abused by priests.
[00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:14.022]  And I want you to hear what they have to say.
[00:02:14.682 --> 00:02:20.408]  But of course, the big stories that we're going to be talking about are the shootings that happened at the end of the week and the reactions to those.
[00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:26.054]  We have CNN turning this into a white shooter.
[00:02:26.114 --> 00:02:29.498]  Even though he's mixed race, we have a story that's up on the Drudge Report.
[00:02:30.178 --> 00:02:39.526]  An Infowars story, CNN turns mixed-race Oregon shooter into a white man and the LA Times is claiming that he was a white supremacist.
[00:02:39.546 --> 00:02:46.973]  We're going to talk about the motivations and the way they're turning this again, yet another story that they're using for divide and conquer.
[00:02:47.473 --> 00:02:48.374]  And of course the
[00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:52.298]  The media is spinning this back and saying we have a war.
[00:02:52.358 --> 00:02:59.306]  That's one of the comments of the man who was the father of the newspaper reporter in Virginia.
[00:02:59.907 --> 00:03:01.949]  As part of that shooting, he says there's a war going on.
[00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.531]  Yes, there's a war at multiple levels.
[00:03:04.292 --> 00:03:11.717]  There's a political war, there's a racial war, there's a divide and conquer that is being pushed by the President, by the media, and that's not being talked about.
[00:03:11.737 --> 00:03:14.778]  We're going to have the reactions though of various candidates.
[00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:20.842]  One of the reactions of candidates, Joe Biden, and let's be honest, Joe Biden is running for President.
[00:03:20.902 --> 00:03:21.703]  That's been admitted.
[00:03:22.323 --> 00:03:24.124]  He hasn't made the official announcement.
[00:03:24.164 --> 00:03:30.028]  He's still, I would say, Joe Biden his time, but he started making comparisons when he talked about the Second Amendment.
[00:03:30.048 --> 00:03:32.890]  He says, you don't have a right to have fighter jets.
[00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.675]  Well, we're going to talk about what the man who has control of the fighter jets has been doing.
[00:03:39.416 --> 00:03:50.067]  Just as we had this shooter in Oregon attack nine people because they were Christians, Obama attacked a hospital because they had some Taliban patients there.
[00:03:50.267 --> 00:03:55.792]  He continued the attack for over a half hour after the Doctors Without Borders had alerted them.
[00:03:55.832 --> 00:03:58.214]  Of course, they knew where that hospital was.
[00:03:58.254 --> 00:04:01.016]  They knew that they were treating people of all different types.
[00:04:01.496 --> 00:04:03.398]  You don't attack hospitals.
[00:04:03.678 --> 00:04:05.880]  You don't attack Red Cross vehicles.
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.681]  You don't shoot medics.
[00:04:08.242 --> 00:04:09.943]  Those are called war crimes.
[00:04:10.304 --> 00:04:12.325]  There's international laws against that.
[00:04:12.946 --> 00:04:17.630]  So we've got a president who killed 19 at a hospital that he attacked.
[00:04:18.336 --> 00:04:19.277]  We're going to talk about that.
[00:04:19.637 --> 00:04:28.145]  Don't lecture us on Second Amendment issues when you are using fighter jets to attack hospitals.
[00:04:28.465 --> 00:04:31.208]  You are a war criminal for doing that.
[00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:32.930]  I'm not the only one saying that.
[00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.311]  The UN is saying that.
[00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:36.993]  The Doctors Without Borders are saying that.
[00:04:37.734 --> 00:04:47.336]  They knew that hospital was a, they had notified them back at the end of September and they contacted them and the attack continued for 30 minutes.
[00:04:47.957 --> 00:05:02.300]  We're also going to talk about what this back and forth in Syria is showing us about the real intentions of the United States in Syria and the use of these Islamic Jihadi terrorists as surrogates for American foreign policy.
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.840]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.681]  We're going to have a report from Alex Jones when we come back.
[00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:08.923]  He's going to talk about the liberal sacraments of the left.
[00:05:09.403 --> 00:05:14.426]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:05:14.566 --> 00:05:20.450]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.273]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:05:25.473 --> 00:05:28.795]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:05:29.035 --> 00:05:30.616]  No needles, no injections.

[00:06:00.876 --> 00:06:01.416]  This is our land.
[00:06:01.436 --> 00:06:01.936]  These are our people.
[00:06:01.956 --> 00:06:02.316]  The workers.
[00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:35.323]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:07:00.082 --> 00:07:02.607]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:07:07.005 --> 00:07:13.591]  Gentlemen, Alex Jones here with breaking news and information reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:07:14.272 --> 00:07:19.978]  Now, as you know, a few days ago in Oregon there was another tragic shooting, 10 people dead.
[00:07:20.698 --> 00:07:31.369]  The man who shot and killed at least 10 people on Thursday openly asked people if they were Christians, just like Columbine, and if they said yes and wouldn't recant their faith, killed them.
[00:07:32.281 --> 00:07:36.565]  But there is almost no corporate mainstream media reporting on that fact.
[00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:38.646]  It's buried in local newspapers.
[00:07:39.267 --> 00:07:43.570]  Imagine if someone went in and asked if they were, quote, gay, and then shot them if they were.
[00:07:44.011 --> 00:07:52.157]  You would have guilt being projected onto all libertarians, all conservatives, all Christians, as if we had committed the crime.
[00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:54.780]  But instead, it's being covered up.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.963]  Just like the racist, crazy, black guy shooting the white reporters.
[00:07:59.684 --> 00:08:00.965]  And then that got swept under the rug.
[00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.671]  This is all part of the larger social engineering.
[00:08:04.711 --> 00:08:12.676]  But in a chilling development, President Obama in multiple speeches has said, we need to look at solutions.
[00:08:13.597 --> 00:08:18.459]  Not just more legislation, but solutions like Australia and the UK had.
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.322]  Well, those solutions in the 90s were total gun confiscation.
[00:08:24.063 --> 00:08:27.845]  In fact, the real Crocodile Dundee, this was in the NRA magazine over a decade ago,
[00:08:29.031 --> 00:08:38.274]  The real Crocodile Dundee that the movie was based on, famous trapper, famous outdoorsman, refused to turn in his guns and the police came and killed him in his home.
[00:08:39.615 --> 00:08:40.335]  He shot three of them.
[00:08:41.135 --> 00:08:44.677]  But this is where gun confiscation goes, is into firefights.
[00:08:45.537 --> 00:08:48.058]  And this is the type of civil war they want to start.
[00:08:49.298 --> 00:08:53.663]  They project this guilt on the gun owners for mass shootings that kill 167 people a year on average.
[00:08:53.683 --> 00:08:53.883]  167 people.
[00:08:53.963 --> 00:08:57.907]  Out of 330 million people, it's one of the rarest forms of death, a mass shooting.
[00:08:57.927 --> 00:08:59.168]  11,000 die a year and change, sometimes 12,000 from guns.
[00:08:59.589 --> 00:09:00.369]  Most of them are suicides.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.941]  Then the next statistic looking up is cops shooting criminals.
[00:09:13.961 --> 00:09:15.341]  Then it's citizens shooting criminals.
[00:09:16.301 --> 00:09:18.822]  Way down there at the bottom is criminals shooting citizens.
[00:09:19.162 --> 00:09:19.802]  That's the truth.
[00:09:19.842 --> 00:09:21.102]  We're an armed society.
[00:09:21.422 --> 00:09:22.523]  And here it is from Breitbart.
[00:09:23.423 --> 00:09:25.383]  Obama goes beyond mere gun control.
[00:09:25.723 --> 00:09:26.884]  Hints of confiscation.
[00:09:27.244 --> 00:09:32.445]  And then it's got his quotes here saying we need to do basically what our friends and allies have done.
[00:09:32.745 --> 00:09:34.245]  Great Britain, Australia and others like it.
[00:09:34.745 --> 00:09:37.726]  And so he goes into talking about going beyond legislation.
[00:09:39.221 --> 00:09:42.922]  Shifting gears, talking about weapons in the hands of, quote, good guys.
[00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:47.823]  I'm not saying the Russians are perfect, but compared to ISIS or Al-Qaeda, they are the good guys.
[00:09:48.503 --> 00:09:53.424]  They're being attacked, their only warm water port in the Mediterranean is being attacked.
[00:09:54.004 --> 00:09:55.105]  Syria is being attacked.
[00:09:55.225 --> 00:10:04.187]  They're being attacked by IS-type terrorists in Tajikistan and in other areas south of Russia, places like Chechnya.
[00:10:04.747 --> 00:10:11.049]  So the Russians have gone in and are actually targeting al-Nusra, which is al-Qaeda, which is the command group of ISIS.
[00:10:11.489 --> 00:10:17.130]  And they're also targeting ISIS, and they're releasing the drone footage of those successful attacks taking place.
[00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.611]  Our government on record funded all the radical Islamists to go into that area.
[00:10:22.832 --> 00:10:24.152]  There are no moderate rebels.
[00:10:24.472 --> 00:10:29.893]  They're trying to turn Syria over to Saudi Arabia that already conquered Syria in the last century.
[00:10:30.153 --> 00:10:31.354]  So they've taken Syria before.
[00:10:31.374 --> 00:10:32.054]  Let's go to this article.
[00:10:33.074 --> 00:10:44.623]  Russian Air Force destroys terrorist command center says the defense ministry releases the video and says that they have hit at least 20 times, 20 sorties against the Islamic State.
[00:10:45.003 --> 00:10:47.845]  You can see the photos, the video, all of it.
[00:10:47.985 --> 00:10:52.348]  It should be American pilots there bombing al-Qaeda.
[00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:56.191]  And of course I made a big deal about this on Friday because it was a huge deal.
[00:10:56.671 --> 00:11:01.315]  I showed everybody Reuters reporting on it where it openly admitted
[00:11:02.552 --> 00:11:18.392]  Reuters, that Al-Nusra is the name of Al-Qaeda in Syria, and that the Russians' first target they hit on Wednesday of last week, with more than 30 attacks, was Al-Nusra command bases, and they actually said, which is an Al-Qaeda group.
[00:11:19.272 --> 00:11:22.973]  And so our government criticized Russia for striking al-Qaeda.
[00:11:23.513 --> 00:11:27.915]  This is how upside down all of this has gotten 14 years after 9-11.
[00:11:28.495 --> 00:11:34.537]  But the truth is, we went after Iraq for 9-11 when Saudi Arabia has been proven to have been involved with our government.
[00:11:35.478 --> 00:11:44.821]  So they use the attacks of 9-11 to go after Iraq, to destabilize the whole Middle East, and then the very people involved in it now have proxy wars taking over.
[00:11:46.198 --> 00:11:48.739]  Let's shift gears now out of that situation.
[00:11:48.759 --> 00:11:53.539]  It's something I warn pregnant women about all the time because I know families this has happened to in Austin.
[00:11:53.559 --> 00:11:57.960]  I know families across the country that have told me about it and sent me their horror stories.
[00:11:58.801 --> 00:12:02.361]  About a third of the marijuana tests they give pregnant women turn out to be false positives.
[00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:05.142]  But so what if a woman has been smoking marijuana?
[00:12:05.702 --> 00:12:07.522]  Is it better to take their kids away from them?
[00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:11.303]  And now it's back in the news up on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:11.443 --> 00:12:15.424]  New mothers tested for drugs without their consent by some Alabama hospitals.
[00:12:16.124 --> 00:12:19.425]  A woman who tested positive for drugs in a hospital can be arrested.
[00:12:19.885 --> 00:12:21.425]  And they take your children away.
[00:12:21.445 --> 00:12:22.385]  That's from all gov.
[00:12:23.025 --> 00:12:25.486]  And you can go read that story at InfoWars.com.
[00:12:25.966 --> 00:12:30.967]  And the reason I'm just bringing that in here is showing how there's a whole predator system.
[00:12:31.367 --> 00:12:40.189]  While the government ships in the majority of the drugs, the big banks launder the drug money, that women aren't being told, when you go in to have a baby at a hospital, they're going to test you for more than 15 drugs.
[00:12:42.017 --> 00:12:43.498]  From prescription to illegal.
[00:12:44.298 --> 00:12:46.659]  And then they're going to ask you, do you have a prescription for this?
[00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:48.039]  Or, why are you smoking marijuana?
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:55.823]  They're not reading you your rights, they're not telling you that they're working with the police, that they have a health department computer terminal that they're entering all that data in.
[00:12:56.083 --> 00:13:01.365]  They're not telling you when they send your husband into the next room to fill out paperwork, that when they ask you, you got enough money, honey?
[00:13:01.825 --> 00:13:02.865]  He treats you nice, honey?
[00:13:03.165 --> 00:13:07.167]  That they're about to put that in a health department report to send CPS to take your kids.
[00:13:08.207 --> 00:13:09.068]  Just like they announced to you,
[00:13:10.365 --> 00:13:16.386]  Social Security recipients direct transfer their money, they're now going to be declared incompetent and have their guns taken.
[00:13:17.207 --> 00:13:19.207]  Even though they pressure you to do automatic wire transfer.
[00:13:19.467 --> 00:13:22.488]  This is the type of stuff that's just going on in this police state.
[00:13:23.648 --> 00:13:30.090]  And then finally, mothers don't have a right with their children to say no to vaccines according to government, but trans-able.
[00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:36.051]  This is a serious story at InfoWars.com with Sirius National Television promoting it.
[00:13:37.259 --> 00:13:54.197]  About how wonderful it was that this woman wanted to be blind and so she poured Drano in her eyes and a psychologist helped pour it in her eyes and it's so beautiful and shouldn't taxpayers pay for people that are going to be on full disability because they had perfect sight and wanted to be blind.
[00:13:55.194 --> 00:14:00.078]  And now, if you have sight, does that hurt someone else's feelings?
[00:14:00.778 --> 00:14:11.046]  Because they say, if you're transgendered, that someone being a father or a mother or a boy or a girl or he or she might hurt you, because you're not a he or she, you're a whatever you think you are that day.
[00:14:11.286 --> 00:14:16.850]  Maybe a box, maybe a dog, maybe an Eiffel Tower, maybe an Easter Bunny, maybe a Keebler Elf, maybe a wombat.
[00:14:18.231 --> 00:14:24.796]  I don't know, it's just whatever you want, everyone has to then follow your lead and do whatever you say, and oh my gosh, you're the boss.
[00:14:25.216 --> 00:14:26.257]  It's social control.
[00:14:26.597 --> 00:14:29.759]  But now, what if other people have sight and you don't?
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.981]  Should we gouge everyone's eyes out to make us equal?
[00:14:33.542 --> 00:14:35.643]  It's now reaching that insane point.
[00:14:36.224 --> 00:14:42.408]  When Jewel Shumping had a psychologist pour drain cleaner in her eyes to blind her, the reason she gave
[00:14:42.768 --> 00:14:47.052]  Was precisely the same justification given by transgender people who have their genitals surgically removed.
[00:14:47.413 --> 00:14:51.216]  And of course now the new move is make this tax payer funded.
[00:14:51.497 --> 00:15:04.970]  You can go see the interview with her, we can play more of it coming up here in future reports, with a straight face, with straight news, like this is a good thing, and you're close minded if you don't accept it.
[00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.810]  You're not cool.
[00:15:07.331 --> 00:15:12.137]  I went blind on purpose, but I don't feel it was a choice.
[00:15:12.918 --> 00:15:13.599]  There you go!
[00:15:13.619 --> 00:15:15.762]  And then it's just how sexy, how cool.
[00:15:15.782 --> 00:15:20.548]  So we're given all these faux rights, while our basic rights are being taken away.
[00:15:21.129 --> 00:15:22.950]  Alright, that's it for this update report.
[00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:25.851]  Alex Jones signing off for now for InfoWars.com.
[00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:28.932]  This is a hardcore globalist takeover to destabilize humanity.
[00:15:29.252 --> 00:15:29.932]  Wake up to it.
[00:15:30.032 --> 00:15:30.672]  Get involved.
[00:15:31.012 --> 00:15:31.733]  Say no to it.
[00:15:32.233 --> 00:15:41.596]  And continue to spread the word about alternative independent media that transcends left and right and is just about preserving human dignity, human liberty, and empowering everybody.
[00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:44.057]  But to empower everybody, you gotta have free will.
[00:15:44.597 --> 00:15:46.518]  You gotta have some winners, some losers.
[00:15:46.818 --> 00:15:52.341]  You gotta have free association to choose in the free market what you like, what you believe.
[00:15:52.601 --> 00:15:58.264]  And then the great people together will vote through our actions to build a better world.
[00:15:58.384 --> 00:15:59.824]  That's the system I stand for.
[00:15:59.925 --> 00:16:01.886]  Free will, free association.

[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.262]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:19:12.562 --> 00:19:17.585]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[00:19:17.625 --> 00:19:18.065]  I don't know.
[00:19:39.033 --> 00:19:39.973]  BrainForce is here.

[00:19:50.638 --> 00:19:53.840]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.920]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.

[00:20:12.882 --> 00:20:15.544]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:31.921 --> 00:20:34.064]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:34.545 --> 00:20:35.967]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:42.136]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, October the 4th, 2015.
[00:20:42.276 --> 00:20:47.002]  I am David Knight, and as you just heard from Alex Jones as he was reporting,
[00:20:47.823 --> 00:20:57.836]  What has happened in the last couple of days, we've had now a major push from Obama trying to use the latest shooting to push for outright gun confiscation.
[00:20:57.876 --> 00:21:03.142]  And of course they're also using it to push for a race war here within this country.
[00:21:03.863 --> 00:21:09.049]  I want to talk about that, and I want to talk about the real war that is heating up in Syria.
[00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:16.898]  We're approaching something that is looking very much like the beginnings of a possible world war, what we've been concerned about for quite some time.
[00:21:16.938 --> 00:21:20.061]  We're seeing that not only in Syria, but also in the Ukraine.
[00:21:20.802 --> 00:21:23.704]  We're going to analyze what's going on there and what's behind it.
[00:21:24.385 --> 00:21:32.732]  As I was out last week, I was listening to Alex Jones' interview with Annie Jacobson and the book that she wrote about the history of DARPA.
[00:21:33.092 --> 00:21:39.477]  I listened to that interview, got me interested in the book, and on my drive home, I listened to the beginning of that book.
[00:21:39.938 --> 00:21:40.919]  It is an amazing book.
[00:21:41.738 --> 00:21:49.100]  You really need to get that, to educate yourself, to educate others about the history of the dark side of our government.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.741]  You need to understand the character of our government.
[00:21:51.761 --> 00:21:57.903]  And I like the way that she takes it all the way back to the Cold War, when she starts talking about the history of DARPA.
[00:21:57.943 --> 00:22:00.204]  It's not a cold documentary type of book.
[00:22:00.724 --> 00:22:01.884]  She has a lot of detail.
[00:22:01.904 --> 00:22:03.925]  She paints a very, very vivid picture
[00:22:04.665 --> 00:22:09.611]  Beginning with the first test of a hydrogen bomb, the fusion bomb.
[00:22:10.151 --> 00:22:12.934]  They were concerned they were going to set the atmosphere on fire because...
[00:22:14.016 --> 00:22:16.218]  It fuses hydrogen atoms.
[00:22:16.758 --> 00:22:21.261]  They thought it might get uncontrolled, and actually, for a while they thought it might.
[00:22:21.321 --> 00:22:25.824]  It was two and a half times larger than they'd expected, so it scared them quite a bit.
[00:22:26.645 --> 00:22:41.416]  When they showed Eisenhower the radiation pattern, the intense radiation, they overlaid that radiation pattern over the northeastern United States, cities where I just was, following the Pope, Washington, New York, Philadelphia.
[00:22:42.176 --> 00:22:51.783]  Showing that most of the people in those areas, in that northeastern corridor, would die from one hydrogen bomb, just from the radiation, just within a couple of hours.
[00:22:52.324 --> 00:22:54.305]  Many more people would die shortly after that.
[00:22:54.885 --> 00:22:59.789]  There was a lot of concern in the country at that time about what they could do for civil defense.
[00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.372]  So they had a hearing, and they had Senator Kefauver,
[00:23:04.446 --> 00:23:10.150]  You might have heard of in many other contexts, but he had a hearing on what are you going to do about civil defense.
[00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:17.815]  The man who got up and testified under oath said, well, we're going to build a few bunkers in the cities, but for the most part, we want people to try to get out of the city.
[00:23:17.855 --> 00:23:19.997]  And he said, well, what are they going to do when they get out of the city?
[00:23:20.817 --> 00:23:22.779]  We recommend that they drive as far as they can.
[00:23:23.379 --> 00:23:29.563]  And then when they see the flash, they get out of their car and lie in a ditch on the side of the road and maybe cover themselves with something.
[00:23:30.844 --> 00:23:33.166]  And they could not believe what they were hearing.
[00:23:34.042 --> 00:23:44.507]  He then modified it and said, well we've talked about possibly putting them in some long concrete tubes that we then might cover up with some dirt.
[00:23:45.747 --> 00:23:47.708]  It was absolutely ridiculous.
[00:23:47.748 --> 00:23:59.133]  And of course we've had many instances of people looking at duck and cover, the nonsense that was put out, the propaganda films that our government put out in the 1960s to try to make people feel better.
[00:23:59.775 --> 00:24:07.017]  There was a cartoon that came out, I think, in the 80s from the UK, making fun of the civil defense preparations in Britain.
[00:24:07.437 --> 00:24:17.980]  It was an older couple, there was a nuclear war, they followed to the letter what they were told to do and the flyers from their government, and you watch them die slowly from radiation poisoning.
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.701]  That is what our government is concerned about.
[00:24:21.741 --> 00:24:25.382]  And of course, at the same time, they were telling Eisenhower to sell this
[00:24:26.644 --> 00:24:34.857]  Any Jacobson talks about her book, The Pentagon's Brain, she talks about how he was conflicted with this because he had seen the radiation patterns.
[00:24:34.877 --> 00:24:37.260]  He knew that all of this was total nonsense.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.963]  There wasn't anything they were going to be able to do.
[00:24:40.165 --> 00:24:41.166]  The people who were
[00:24:42.125 --> 00:24:47.308]  The people who triggered the explosion on Bikini Island nearly died from radiation themselves.
[00:24:47.368 --> 00:24:50.029]  They were in a hardened facility.
[00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:57.473]  It had ten feet of soil over three foot thick concrete walls and the radiation was so high inside of that.
[00:24:58.213 --> 00:25:00.154]  They were miles away from ground zero.
[00:25:00.314 --> 00:25:02.756]  Radiation was so high even in that preparation bunker.
[00:25:03.595 --> 00:25:04.695]  That they nearly died.
[00:25:05.496 --> 00:25:12.577]  So Eisenhower knew all this, and he was asked to sell this civil defense to the people at the same time.
[00:25:13.338 --> 00:25:32.323]  They had German scientists who came over from Operation Paperclip building bunkers inside of mountains for them that were essentially a thousand-foot-thick concrete walls so that Eisenhower, or whoever was president, could survive in a kind of Dr. Strangelove scenario.
[00:25:33.283 --> 00:25:34.964]  This is your compassionate government.
[00:25:35.525 --> 00:25:37.786]  This is the government that wants you to give up everything.
[00:25:38.047 --> 00:25:38.967]  All of your liberties.
[00:25:39.207 --> 00:25:42.630]  They want you to give up your guns because they're going to keep you safe.
[00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.191]  Because they care about you.
[00:25:44.812 --> 00:25:44.972]  No.
[00:25:45.352 --> 00:25:45.712]  No they don't.
[00:25:45.972 --> 00:25:47.514]  Let me give you a couple of other examples.
[00:25:48.373 --> 00:25:50.094]  This just came out the last couple of days.
[00:25:50.234 --> 00:25:56.759]  Secret Service targeting of Representative Jason Chaffez could give pause to other lawmakers.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:00.743]  The Secret Service went after him because he investigated their incompetence.
[00:26:01.283 --> 00:26:02.444]  So they exposed him.
[00:26:02.564 --> 00:26:12.512]  Even Sensenbrenner, the lead author of the Patriot Act, has protested lax oversight of the National Security Agency's activities and this leak.
[00:26:13.092 --> 00:26:26.985]  So, the lawmakers are very concerned about this because they realize that even if they question the Praetorian Guard that guards the President for incompetence, they themselves could become targets of blackmail.
[00:26:27.765 --> 00:26:32.209]  That's where this secret, dark government that answers no questions
[00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:36.491]  That's why it's very important for you to understand the background of DARPA.
[00:26:36.511 --> 00:26:39.132]  It's important for you to understand the background of the NSA.
[00:26:39.512 --> 00:26:44.294]  To know that it was created by executive order by President Truman.
[00:26:44.974 --> 00:26:52.997]  And when they were questioned on it, on their abuses, of what they did in the 1970s, we had the Church hearings, in the Senate we had the Pike hearings, in the House.
[00:26:53.258 --> 00:26:59.480]  And when Representative Pike asked the NSA, and of course it was a big deal to have the NSA even appear at a hearing, when he asked him,
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.823]  Show me what your charter says you can do.
[00:27:02.903 --> 00:27:06.266]  Because at that time, they were spying on Americans illegally.
[00:27:07.167 --> 00:27:12.091]  The NSA director told him, I'm not going to show you the executive order that created us.
[00:27:12.352 --> 00:27:15.014]  And he was absolutely amazed.
[00:27:15.415 --> 00:27:19.919]  Congressman Pike said, we're giving you tens of billions of dollars a year and you won't even show us your charter?
[00:27:20.649 --> 00:27:21.290]  And he said yes.
[00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:24.452]  That's the kind of dark, secret government we have.
[00:27:24.492 --> 00:27:25.253]  Here's another example.
[00:27:25.313 --> 00:27:27.214]  Mint Press blacked out pages.
[00:27:27.294 --> 00:27:27.514]  U.S.
[00:27:27.554 --> 00:27:32.658]  government snubs ACLU over targeted killing and a freedom of information request.
[00:27:32.678 --> 00:27:33.259]  They say the U.S.
[00:27:33.299 --> 00:27:40.925]  government gave the ACLU the equivalent of the middle finger in response to requests for records on the targeted killing program, an eight-page letter
[00:27:41.385 --> 00:27:43.827]  From the Director for National Intelligence, James Clapper.
[00:27:43.847 --> 00:27:54.135]  This is a guy who lied to Senator Wyden, saying that there was no surveillance of people, just about a month before Ed Snowden released all of his documents.
[00:27:55.356 --> 00:28:02.682]  James Clapper released this eight-page letter to a couple of senators, Republican Senator Chambliss and Democrat Senator Feinstein.
[00:28:03.523 --> 00:28:07.726]  And the eight pages were completely blacked out, except for one sentence at the bottom.
[00:28:08.601 --> 00:28:13.513]  Says, we hope this information has been helpful and we look forward to continuing to work with the committee on this bill.
[00:28:14.755 --> 00:28:21.538]  This is a kind of Orwellian doublespeak that is worthy of Terry Gilliam's Brazil, one of my favorite movies.
[00:28:21.558 --> 00:28:22.018]  But you know what?
[00:28:22.698 --> 00:28:24.659]  I don't like living in that kind of a movie.
[00:28:25.119 --> 00:28:26.440]  And that's the kind of movie we're living in.
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.520]  One more example.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:40.185]  In 2013, the ACLU received a response on the Freedom of Information Act request for information from the FBI on how it interpreted law enforcement's requirements to get a search warrant to put a GPS device on a suspect's car.
[00:28:40.825 --> 00:28:44.908]  The FBI sent the ACLU two documents entirely blacked out.
[00:28:45.168 --> 00:28:52.814]  110 pages of blacked out documents were returned in compliance with the Freedom of Information Act.
[00:28:53.274 --> 00:28:55.856]  That is the kind of arrogance that we have from our government.
[00:28:56.156 --> 00:29:02.981]  And I'm going to give you some more examples of arrogance going after gun control, shooting up hospitals at the same time.
[00:29:03.001 --> 00:29:04.862]  Yes, that's our president, President Obama.
[00:29:04.882 --> 00:29:05.863]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:29:11.632 --> 00:29:21.018]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:29:21.358 --> 00:29:23.919]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:29:24.059 --> 00:29:27.401]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:29:27.602 --> 00:29:33.645]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[00:29:33.945 --> 00:29:36.467]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[00:29:36.647 --> 00:29:38.789]  And then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[00:29:39.069 --> 00:29:45.234]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[00:29:45.454 --> 00:29:52.900]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:30:00.443]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[00:30:09.298 --> 00:30:14.744]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:30:15.045 --> 00:30:29.501]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:30:29.741 --> 00:30:37.564]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:30:37.744 --> 00:30:43.186]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:30:43.306 --> 00:30:46.687]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:30:46.867 --> 00:30:50.868]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:30:51.009 --> 00:30:54.890]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:59.315]  LiverShield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.
[00:30:59.435 --> 00:31:04.441]  Secure your LiverShield today exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com for the lowest price available.

[00:31:08.666 --> 00:31:14.092]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife Vitamin B12 formulation.

[00:31:20.414 --> 00:31:25.016]  Methocobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:28.537]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:31:28.777 --> 00:31:30.357]  No needles, no injections.

[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:39.941]  Brain Force is here.
[00:31:40.121 --> 00:31:42.222]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:31:42.322 --> 00:31:47.064]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:31:47.324 --> 00:31:48.965]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[00:31:49.025 --> 00:31:50.466]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:31:50.606 --> 00:31:53.828]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:31:54.088 --> 00:31:55.789]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:31:56.069 --> 00:31:56.969]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:31:56.989 --> 00:31:57.930]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:00.070]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:07.293]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:32:08.854 --> 00:32:15.736]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:33:30.251 --> 00:33:35.424]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:35.945 --> 00:33:38.211]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:40.026 --> 00:33:42.668]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:42.748 --> 00:33:43.989]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:46.110]  We're going to talk about the shooting in Oregon.
[00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:52.514]  We're going to talk about how Obama is using it, surprise, surprise, to push gun control, but going a little bit farther.
[00:33:52.915 --> 00:33:59.159]  This time talking about gun confiscation, hinting very clearly at gun confiscation.
[00:33:59.219 --> 00:34:00.800]  We're going to talk about how the media spends this.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:04.923]  We're going to talk about the reaction of various politicians running for
[00:34:06.143 --> 00:34:15.271]  President from both parties and we're also going to talk about the mass shooting killing spree of Barack Obama himself that just happened in the last day or so.
[00:34:16.051 --> 00:34:19.474]  Before we do I want to let you know that liver shield is back in stock.
[00:34:20.055 --> 00:34:23.958]  We keep selling out of liver shield and there's a really good reason for it.
[00:34:23.998 --> 00:34:33.606]  It uses a powerful blend of wild crafted herbs specifically formulated to support natural function and detoxification of the liver and the gallbladder.
[00:34:34.346 --> 00:34:35.187]  Try Liver Shield.
[00:34:35.367 --> 00:34:39.429]  Learn how to perform a liver flush at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:41.091]  This is a limited run.
[00:34:41.151 --> 00:34:43.252]  We keep selling out of it very, very often.
[00:34:43.272 --> 00:34:45.013]  As soon as we get it in, it sells out.
[00:34:45.333 --> 00:34:47.975]  And we have it in stock right now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:34:47.995 --> 00:34:52.458]  Let me read you a couple of reviews from people who leave reviews on our site.
[00:34:52.478 --> 00:34:55.900]  And again, that's a good way to see if the products are right for you.
[00:34:55.961 --> 00:35:03.806]  I like to read reviews at the bottom of products or books at Amazon before I purchase, whether I get it from Amazon or whether I get it from a local retailer.
[00:35:04.486 --> 00:35:08.067]  I like to get other people's responses when they use the product.
[00:35:08.087 --> 00:35:09.828]  This is what some people have said about Liver Shield.
[00:35:09.848 --> 00:35:10.728]  This is from M.P.
[00:35:11.128 --> 00:35:11.989]  Donellan, Florida.
[00:35:12.009 --> 00:35:14.450]  He says, this product is exactly what it says it is.
[00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.150]  I would buy it again and again.
[00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.071]  The results are true.
[00:35:17.191 --> 00:35:18.351]  I even feel much better.
[00:35:18.751 --> 00:35:21.512]  I'm female and I am not afraid to say so.
[00:35:21.652 --> 00:35:23.773]  In my 50s, I had no idea I could feel this good.
[00:35:24.353 --> 00:35:26.214]  I would recommend this product to anyone.
[00:35:26.274 --> 00:35:27.335]  Do just as directed.
[00:35:27.715 --> 00:35:28.915]  You'll be shocked at the results.
[00:35:28.975 --> 00:35:32.477]  I eat right, exercise, and do it all, but I still needed this.
[00:35:32.557 --> 00:35:33.377]  Results proved it.
[00:35:33.618 --> 00:35:34.318]  She says do it.
[00:35:34.838 --> 00:35:36.279]  Also from Carl in the UK.
[00:35:36.379 --> 00:35:39.080]  He says this is hardcore detox stuff.
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:40.861]  I would advise anyone to read up on this.
[00:35:41.241 --> 00:35:41.661]  It works.
[00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:46.504]  And again, you can find out how to perform a liver flush at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:35:46.824 --> 00:35:50.446]  And Liver Shield is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:35:52.199 --> 00:36:00.106]  Now, some of the things that have come out of this shooting, first of all, this interesting article about one of the heroes that came out of this, Chris Mintz.
[00:36:00.706 --> 00:36:06.592]  There's a GoFundMe page for him, and it raised half a million dollars in just 24 hours.
[00:36:06.752 --> 00:36:10.015]  Actually, since this article has been written, it's gone up another $223,000.
[00:36:10.055 --> 00:36:11.536]  It was $723,000 just before the show began, when I last looked.
[00:36:17.361 --> 00:36:28.465]  From what I understand, of course it's not really clear what happened there, but it appears from the narratives that I've seen, that as the shooter was trying to get into another room, he tried to hold the door back.
[00:36:28.505 --> 00:36:31.046]  He was shot multiple times, various parts of his body.
[00:36:31.766 --> 00:36:37.308]  He was shot in his legs as well as, I think, his arms and hands, but he's going to have to learn how to walk.
[00:36:37.768 --> 00:36:38.390]  All over again.
[00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:48.450]  If you want to try to help him, you can find the address for that GoFundMe project embedded in the article there, talking about how people are chipping in to help him.
[00:36:49.059 --> 00:36:50.640]  And again, this is a veteran.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:59.042]  This is somebody who's been trained to respond quickly, to run to the sound of shots, rather than running away.
[00:36:59.082 --> 00:37:02.564]  Just like these people in the Paris train attack.
[00:37:02.584 --> 00:37:04.804]  Remember, it was a couple of months ago, maybe?
[00:37:04.904 --> 00:37:06.125]  I don't know if it was that long ago.
[00:37:06.185 --> 00:37:09.466]  Maybe it was just about a month ago, but there was a would-be shooter.
[00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:23.699]  Got on a train, and there were a couple of vets there, along with a British citizen, and they rushed the guy and subdued him before he was able to shoot other people on the train.
[00:37:24.439 --> 00:37:25.420]  One of them was injured.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:39.910]  And the interesting thing is that one of these heroes from that Paris train potential attack, Alex Scarlatos, actually is an alumni of that same community college where this shooting just happened.
[00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:45.654]  He said, I would have tried to take him down, and that's precisely what the other veteran did.
[00:37:46.175 --> 00:37:50.438]  You know, we never know what's going to happen in our life, how we're going to respond.
[00:37:51.239 --> 00:38:00.046]  And it's interesting, many of us, I think, look at this and say, well, if somebody pointed a gun at you and you knew they were going to kill you, if you said you were a Christian, what would you say?
[00:38:00.066 --> 00:38:04.230]  I looked at that and it's, you know, honestly, I don't know.
[00:38:05.325 --> 00:38:10.487]  I would say that I wouldn't deny Jesus, but Peter said that, and he did it anyway.
[00:38:10.527 --> 00:38:13.509]  You know, God's grace is big enough either way.
[00:38:14.689 --> 00:38:20.012]  But the main thing that I can't understand is why people wouldn't rush the shooter.
[00:38:20.932 --> 00:38:23.253]  I don't understand lining up and waiting.
[00:38:23.313 --> 00:38:29.596]  I wasn't there, I don't know all the details that people have said, but I simply don't understand not fighting back.
[00:38:30.236 --> 00:38:33.638]  Not trying to save your life, not trying to save other people's lives.
[00:38:34.397 --> 00:38:40.400]  So regardless of what you would do in that kind of a situation, I mean, my first response would not be to give an answer.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.001]  My response would be to run at him.
[00:38:42.842 --> 00:38:43.442]  I would hope.
[00:38:43.782 --> 00:38:47.724]  I would hope that if everybody were to run at him, at least some of the people would take him down.
[00:38:47.824 --> 00:38:55.488]  And that's essentially what is behind the idea of us having the ability and the will to protect ourselves.
[00:38:56.149 --> 00:38:57.910]  That's one of the reasons we have the Second Amendment.
[00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:01.832]  But the other reason we have the Second Amendment is as a check on government power.
[00:39:02.847 --> 00:39:13.091]  As I was just mentioning in the last segment, talking about the way the government reacted to the nuclear situation during the Cold War with Russia back in the 60s.
[00:39:13.911 --> 00:39:23.114]  Of course, there was the Mutual Assured Destruction policy, saying that, well, we're going to try to arm ourselves to the extent that there won't be a war.
[00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:26.235]  That was the way that they approached the Cold War.
[00:39:26.295 --> 00:39:31.637]  And quite frankly, the Second Amendment is really a Mutual Assured Destruction pact as well.
[00:39:32.338 --> 00:39:44.549]  I've had many people say to me, you realize, of course, that you're not going to be able to stop the military with all of their equipment, the sophisticated, high firepower equipment that they have.
[00:39:44.569 --> 00:39:46.411]  You're not going to be able to stop them with your pistols.
[00:39:47.231 --> 00:39:50.735]  And I would always remind them of what happened in the Warsaw Ghetto.
[00:39:52.193 --> 00:39:54.294]  There you had a lot of people who were disarmed.
[00:39:54.674 --> 00:39:57.055]  Jews were lined up in the Warsaw Ghetto by the Nazis.
[00:39:57.075 --> 00:39:58.335]  They were guarded by the Nazis.
[00:39:59.335 --> 00:40:06.337]  And with a few hammers, they got one or two pistols and then began collecting arms from soldiers that they killed.
[00:40:06.998 --> 00:40:14.760]  And before long, you had an entire panzer division that was penned down by citizens who had the will to resist.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.001]  That was what they needed, was the will.
[00:40:18.018 --> 00:40:20.100]  If you have the will, you will find the tools.
[00:40:20.481 --> 00:40:21.862]  Firearms are simply tools.
[00:40:23.064 --> 00:40:31.092]  And the only way they could put down that rebellion, even with a couple of Panzer divisions, was to burn the entire city to the ground.
[00:40:31.953 --> 00:40:38.160]  We saw that recreated at Waco a few decades later, on exactly the same day, April the 19th.
[00:40:39.451 --> 00:40:51.296]  So understand that we may not win wars, but our government, even with all of its firepower, has never won an asymmetric war since World War II.
[00:40:51.777 --> 00:40:53.117]  They've never won an asymmetric war.
[00:40:53.658 --> 00:40:54.558]  They will admit it to you.
[00:40:55.919 --> 00:40:57.319]  And that's what we need to understand.
[00:40:57.519 --> 00:41:00.421]  It is a deterrence to tyranny.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:09.569]  You don't have to have a fighting war, and we hope that doesn't happen, just as we had always hoped through the Cold War there would not be a nuclear exchange.
[00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:12.092]  It truly is a nuclear option.
[00:41:12.993 --> 00:41:14.194]  But it has to be there.
[00:41:14.615 --> 00:41:19.821]  That's why the founders of our country created the Second Amendment as a deterrence to tyranny.
[00:41:20.682 --> 00:41:21.563]  If you don't have it,
[00:41:22.537 --> 00:41:23.837]  What do you think is going to happen?
[00:41:24.317 --> 00:41:28.959]  When I looked at the headlines, and actually I saw a USA Today paper, a physical paper.
[00:41:29.399 --> 00:41:33.300]  I look at USA Today online all the time, but it had been a long time since I saw the paper.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.220]  I was on vacation.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:40.742]  The headline said something to the effect, mass shooting at school dot dot dot again.
[00:41:41.502 --> 00:41:41.762]  Again.
[00:41:41.782 --> 00:41:49.905]  And when I looked at that I thought, does USA Today do that when we have yet another case of police brutality?
[00:41:50.445 --> 00:41:50.845]  Do they put
[00:41:51.681 --> 00:41:56.684]  Police nearly kill or do kill someone who is in handcuffs again.
[00:41:56.704 --> 00:42:02.589]  Do you really want to have the government be the only ones who have access to weapons?
[00:42:02.609 --> 00:42:05.991]  Do you want them to have a total monopoly on force?
[00:42:06.912 --> 00:42:08.433]  I don't want to see a situation like that.
[00:42:09.417 --> 00:42:12.079]  Take a look at this article that is on Infowars.com.
[00:42:12.119 --> 00:42:14.481]  Cops rupture handcuffed man's spleen.
[00:42:14.521 --> 00:42:15.161]  They laugh at him.
[00:42:15.181 --> 00:42:18.524]  They take pictures as he lay dying and begging.
[00:42:18.544 --> 00:42:21.185]  This is a police sergeant and an officer.
[00:42:21.206 --> 00:42:23.887]  They were finally fired 14 months.
[00:42:23.907 --> 00:42:24.368]  14 months!
[00:42:26.169 --> 00:42:41.158]  After surveillance video caught the officer violently kneeing a handcuffed man after rupturing the man's spleen, the officers ignored his pleas for medical attention for nearly hours while laughing at him off camera, later lying to investigators regarding the incident.
[00:42:41.178 --> 00:42:42.739]  Let's play a little bit of a clip of that.
[00:42:43.679 --> 00:42:44.640]  We'll do that when we come back.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:45.401]  We're going to go to break.
[00:42:45.941 --> 00:42:49.224]  When we come back, we're going to play a little bit of a clip of that for you.
[00:42:49.384 --> 00:42:54.909]  And I want you to understand, just as the Greeks said about power, a fish rots from the head down.
[00:42:54.949 --> 00:43:01.694]  And of course, we see this government corruption in Washington starting there and corrupting the police at the local level.
[00:43:02.035 --> 00:43:05.378]  That's what we have to be aware of, and that's what we have to push back.
[00:43:05.438 --> 00:43:05.898]  Stay with us.
[00:43:06.118 --> 00:43:06.679]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:08.365 --> 00:43:10.167]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:43:10.188 --> 00:43:15.214]  Now, armed Air Force vet was prevented from stopping Oregon gunman, article up by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:43:15.374 --> 00:43:24.106]  An Air Force veteran who had a licensed concealed carry gun was prevented by staff from intervening in the shooting yesterday at the Oregon Community College during which 10 people were killed.
[00:43:24.246 --> 00:43:28.007]  John Parker was situated in a building about 200 yards away from where the shooting began.
[00:43:28.247 --> 00:43:31.628]  There were a few people in the Vet Center and then we heard the shooting happen.
[00:43:31.708 --> 00:43:34.249]  We got up and we were going to go over and see what we could do.
[00:43:34.569 --> 00:43:37.790]  Immediately, the school staff stopped us and told us to get inside of the building.
[00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:40.410]  Essentially, the staff wouldn't let us go to assist.
[00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:46.552]  One courageous man who also tried to apprehend the shooter, Army veteran Chris Mintz, ended up being shot five times.
[00:43:46.812 --> 00:43:47.893]  Mince was unarmed.
[00:43:48.073 --> 00:43:54.136]  In asserting his right to concealed carry, Parker was knowingly violating a rule which declared the college to be a gun-free zone.
[00:43:54.356 --> 00:43:57.717]  This is why we need to arm our students.
[00:43:57.877 --> 00:44:04.300]  I guarantee you the students in Oregon wish they had the ability to be able to defend themselves and those around them.
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:06.882]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.

[00:46:02.611 --> 00:46:06.393]  Many of the products at InfoWarsLife.com are true game changers.
[00:46:06.413 --> 00:46:07.293]  They are compounds.
[00:46:14.616 --> 00:46:15.036]  I don't know.
[00:46:43.117 --> 00:46:48.602]  You're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[00:46:48.742 --> 00:46:51.925]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[00:46:52.045 --> 00:46:56.069]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[00:46:56.229 --> 00:46:58.371]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[00:46:58.551 --> 00:47:05.517]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:47:12.961 --> 00:47:15.722]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:20.585 --> 00:47:26.487]  They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[00:47:28.548 --> 00:47:34.531]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[00:47:34.551 --> 00:47:37.893]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[00:47:41.621 --> 00:47:42.882]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:42.943 --> 00:47:44.184]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:47:44.885 --> 00:47:47.908]  I want to get back to the shooting in Oregon, how it's being used.
[00:47:47.948 --> 00:47:50.311]  Of course, it's being used to start up a race war.
[00:47:50.331 --> 00:47:53.654]  Obama's implying that he wants to go to gun confiscation.
[00:47:54.428 --> 00:48:02.013]  I want to talk about that, but before I do, real quickly, we have Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine now in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[00:48:02.133 --> 00:48:04.474]  It's my number one pick for you and your family.
[00:48:04.914 --> 00:48:08.537]  It's always been super high-quality nascent iodine.
[00:48:08.957 --> 00:48:12.219]  It's a great nutrient supplement that you need in your life.
[00:48:12.259 --> 00:48:13.199]  You need to have iodine.
[00:48:13.219 --> 00:48:14.500]  They've taken it out of your food.
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:17.302]  This is a way that you can make sure that you are getting
[00:48:17.822 --> 00:48:20.724]  The amount of iodine that your body needs each day.
[00:48:20.824 --> 00:48:24.226]  I take it every day, and I'm stocking up on it now while it's in stock.
[00:48:24.666 --> 00:48:28.909]  It's ultra-clean, ultra-powerful, derived from our limited supply of deep earth crystals.
[00:48:29.009 --> 00:48:30.690]  Plus, it funds our operation.
[00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:33.072]  It's a win across the board.
[00:48:33.092 --> 00:48:34.813]  A win-win situation, as Alex says.
[00:48:34.893 --> 00:48:36.694]  It's a 360 win.
[00:48:37.114 --> 00:48:42.037]  Get your X2 Nascent Iodine at Infowarslife.com while supplies last.
[00:48:42.097 --> 00:48:44.039]  And again, we do have that in stock right now.
[00:48:44.639 --> 00:48:44.799]  I think?
[00:49:01.807 --> 00:49:04.928]  They roughed him up, kicked him as he was handcuffed.
[00:49:04.948 --> 00:49:06.328]  They kicked him in the stomach.
[00:49:06.788 --> 00:49:11.330]  They say he was upset and injured after they left him handcuffed inside of a jail cell.
[00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:14.631]  He then head-butted the glass window on the cell door.
[00:49:15.031 --> 00:49:17.592]  And then we have this surveillance video.
[00:49:17.612 --> 00:49:18.912]  I want to play a little bit of this for you.
[00:49:20.379 --> 00:49:27.041]  That's what happened to 40-year-old Robert Lease last August after being arrested by OPD for leaving a bar without paying for his drink.
[00:49:27.481 --> 00:49:40.264]  Lease's lawyer says after Lease headbutts the holding cell window, catching his cap in the crack, Orlando officer Peter Delio slammed Lease with a knee strike so forceful it ruptured his spleen and an artery.
[00:49:40.584 --> 00:49:42.004]  Let me help you.
[00:49:42.164 --> 00:49:43.004]  Stop resisting!
[00:49:43.045 --> 00:49:44.825]  I'm not resisting!
[00:49:45.045 --> 00:49:45.625]  There you are!
[00:49:45.925 --> 00:49:46.905]  Get up, scumbag!
[00:49:46.925 --> 00:49:48.866]  You wanna be a tough guy?
[00:49:51.696 --> 00:49:53.877]  Okay, so you can see that in what they're describing.
[00:49:54.057 --> 00:49:57.839]  For those of you who are listening on the radio, they're basically throwing him around.
[00:49:57.919 --> 00:49:59.520]  After kneeing him, they throw him around.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.801]  They say, like a rag doll, it says in the article.
[00:50:02.362 --> 00:50:07.124]  Then they delayed calling the medics when they came in.
[00:50:07.164 --> 00:50:08.365]  They misdirected the medics.
[00:50:08.465 --> 00:50:11.626]  And you can watch this video if you look at the article on Infowars.com.
[00:50:12.447 --> 00:50:13.767]  So, here's the situation.
[00:50:13.787 --> 00:50:16.289]  They were suspended for a week without pay.
[00:50:17.401 --> 00:50:21.304]  Finally, in March, they were arrested and charged with felony battery.
[00:50:22.245 --> 00:50:25.127]  This is why we have to have videos.
[00:50:25.147 --> 00:50:26.648]  This is why we need to watch the police.
[00:50:26.668 --> 00:50:37.797]  But we need to also understand that these kinds of rules, this kind of engagement with the police, this kind of bullying that goes unpunished, is what is corrupting our police departments.
[00:50:37.877 --> 00:50:40.439]  And it's being encouraged from Washington.
[00:50:41.687 --> 00:50:46.769]  We looked at what happened in New Mexico with the shooting of a homeless man that drew attention to a lot of this.
[00:50:46.789 --> 00:50:50.391]  This is one of the first shootings, I think, that really captured a lot of people's imagination.
[00:50:50.431 --> 00:50:52.772]  Of course, this is going on continuously.
[00:50:52.852 --> 00:50:56.874]  Obama says he's kind of become routine to see school shootings.
[00:50:56.894 --> 00:51:01.676]  Well, they're not nearly as routine as police shootings, let me tell you, or police beatings.
[00:51:01.776 --> 00:51:02.577]  What is driving this?
[00:51:03.357 --> 00:51:07.539]  A new curriculum was being taught at the New Mexico State Police Academy.
[00:51:08.099 --> 00:51:12.161]  And a guy who had been an instructor there for a very long time says, I refuse to teach this.
[00:51:12.481 --> 00:51:15.183]  This is a shoot first curriculum.
[00:51:15.743 --> 00:51:17.484]  I'm not going to teach people to shoot first.
[00:51:18.044 --> 00:51:19.905]  That's what the federal government wants done, though.
[00:51:20.525 --> 00:51:21.666]  And that's what they are pushing.
[00:51:22.691 --> 00:51:25.453]  They're also pushing a war, a race war.
[00:51:25.513 --> 00:51:28.214]  We have this article that's up on the Drudge Report today.
[00:51:28.254 --> 00:51:32.597]  CNN turns the mixed-race Oregon shooter into a white man.
[00:51:33.037 --> 00:51:37.240]  And of course, the LA Times also claims that he's a white supremacist.
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:40.802]  CNN did not show photos of his mother, who is black.
[00:51:40.842 --> 00:51:41.242]  They showed
[00:51:41.782 --> 00:51:41.963]  I think?
[00:51:57.885 --> 00:51:59.866]  And yet you see that where we had the shooting in Virginia,
[00:52:23.973 --> 00:52:27.175]  The racial undertones on that were completely ignored.
[00:52:27.235 --> 00:52:29.216]  They focused instead on gun control.
[00:52:29.236 --> 00:52:37.981]  They didn't focus on the fact that he had followed the narrative from Obama, from Black Lives Matter, from the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:52:38.001 --> 00:52:40.942]  They didn't pay any attention to that whatsoever.
[00:52:40.982 --> 00:52:43.784]  They focused strictly on pushing gun control.
[00:52:43.844 --> 00:52:45.105]  And now we've got the father
[00:52:45.945 --> 00:52:48.287]  Of that reporter in Virginia who was shot.
[00:52:48.988 --> 00:52:54.792]  He's now using his daughter's death to make himself a Democrat Party celebrity pushing gun control.
[00:52:54.872 --> 00:53:01.657]  His name is Andy Parker and he put out a USA Today editorial that says the Oregon shooting shows that we are at war.
[00:53:02.697 --> 00:53:05.559]  Now he's saying that they're at war with the NRA.
[00:53:06.159 --> 00:53:19.368]  But no, this is a race war, this is a cultural war, this is a political war of divide and conquer that is created by Obama, by the media, by the Southern Poverty Law Center, by Black Lives Matter that is funded by George Soros.
[00:53:19.749 --> 00:53:22.771]  That is the kind of war that they are pushing.
[00:53:23.791 --> 00:53:29.075]  You know, wars are preceded by propaganda and that's precisely what they have done.
[00:53:29.335 --> 00:53:30.356]  When I was in Oregon,
[00:53:31.328 --> 00:53:41.204]  We were on vacation, and we were in Portland, Oregon, and we went to a, uh, it was an old elementary school that had been transformed into a hotel and a restaurant, and we were just walking through looking at what they had done.
[00:53:41.224 --> 00:53:43.668]  It was kind of interesting architecturally, and so we were walking the halls.
[00:53:44.525 --> 00:53:51.452]  I heard a presentation that was going on in a room there, and I heard all these Southern Poverty Law Center talking points.
[00:53:52.292 --> 00:54:09.429]  And I stopped and I walked over there and I took a little bit of video and I just kind of looked to see what they were talking about, and up on the projector behind the speaker, this was the title of the event that they had there, The Resurgence of Hate Crimes in America, Charleston and Beyond.
[00:54:10.387 --> 00:54:18.919]  And of course they were talking about the white shooter in Charleston that went in and shot the black Christians in a church, sat there and prayed with them for a while, and then shot them.
[00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:23.205]  But it was one week, one week, after this Virginia shooting.
[00:54:23.988 --> 00:54:26.989]  Did they talk at all about Vester Flanagan?
[00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.650]  No.
[00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:30.731]  There was not anything said about Vester Flanagan.
[00:54:30.991 --> 00:54:32.812]  Let me read you some of the stuff I've got.
[00:54:32.852 --> 00:54:34.132]  Yeah, you can get a shot of this.
[00:54:34.933 --> 00:54:36.914]  I took photographs of their flyer.
[00:54:37.514 --> 00:54:39.255]  This was a thing called Race Talks.
[00:54:39.295 --> 00:54:42.396]  Let me give you some of the topics that these people put out in Race Talks.
[00:54:42.436 --> 00:54:43.897]  This is something that's run by a church.
[00:54:44.777 --> 00:54:46.718]  Uh, that's in the local area, a liberal church.
[00:54:47.198 --> 00:54:48.779]  Some of these, learning to be white.
[00:54:49.079 --> 00:54:50.520]  That was one of their topics before this.
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.961]  Another one, Islam, a religion of peace.
[00:54:53.341 --> 00:54:56.903]  And again, the resurgence of hate crimes in America, Charleston and beyond.
[00:54:57.704 --> 00:55:01.626]  Talking about some very obscure cases that I was not even aware of.
[00:55:02.566 --> 00:55:18.573]  But completely ignoring the situation in Virginia where we were given a shooter manifesto that said he was attacking these people because they were racist, because they were white, and of course that is precisely what they are teaching in these race talks.
[00:55:19.033 --> 00:55:24.416]  They want to say that, you know, cross-cultural adoption and African-American hair care.
[00:55:24.896 --> 00:55:25.376]  That's fine.
[00:55:25.536 --> 00:55:25.957]  That's fine.
[00:55:25.977 --> 00:55:31.179]  I have friends, you know, it wasn't possible for us to adopt a black child 30, 40 years ago.
[00:55:31.219 --> 00:55:32.200]  We tried in North Carolina.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:32.780]  They wouldn't do it.
[00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:34.381]  I now have some friends who have done that.
[00:55:34.581 --> 00:55:36.002]  I'm in favor of that.
[00:55:36.042 --> 00:55:38.363]  I think that's a great idea.
[00:55:38.463 --> 00:55:42.025]  There's so many children who are locked up in the system who can't get out.
[00:55:42.685 --> 00:55:48.008]  Especially black children, because their parents, many of them, have been locked up in this insane war on drugs.
[00:55:48.628 --> 00:56:02.515]  I'm not saying that the children should be given to the parents if they're addicts, but I also know that there are a lot of people who are locked away in mandatory minimum sentences because of possession of marijuana, something that doesn't necessarily threaten anyone.
[00:56:03.096 --> 00:56:03.476]  Nevertheless,
[00:56:04.795 --> 00:56:15.537]  What they're selling here is the narrative of white privilege, white people are evil, only white people can be racist, and that's precisely what we're hearing from the media.
[00:56:15.657 --> 00:56:21.078]  And they're ignoring the war against white people that we saw with this shooter in Virginia.
[00:56:21.538 --> 00:56:24.979]  Instead, we hear from this Oregon shooter's dad.
[00:56:25.639 --> 00:56:29.120]  He says, quote, that's what guns are, the killers.
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:30.840]  He said the guns are the killers.
[00:56:31.854 --> 00:56:34.638]  You understand, guns are inanimate objects.
[00:56:35.579 --> 00:56:35.799]  Okay?
[00:56:35.859 --> 00:56:38.663]  They cannot, they don't run out and shoot people.
[00:56:39.404 --> 00:56:39.684]  Okay?
[00:56:40.245 --> 00:56:47.915]  We need to have an investigation of this guy's background and we need to maybe, maybe we do need to change some of the gun laws.
[00:56:48.669 --> 00:56:57.836]  Maybe we need to make some of the parents civilly liable if they're unwilling to take any responsibility for the actions of their children as this parent is.
[00:56:58.397 --> 00:56:59.477]  You got this Oregon shooter.
[00:57:00.598 --> 00:57:02.320]  He's the father of this guy.
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:04.561]  But he's not responsible for anything.
[00:57:04.861 --> 00:57:07.223]  No, an inanimate object is responsible.
[00:57:07.744 --> 00:57:13.128]  And we should take the firearms from people who have used them to protect their families.
[00:57:13.988 --> 00:57:17.311]  We should take firearms from people who are law-abiding citizens who haven't harmed anyone.
[00:57:18.939 --> 00:57:22.262]  We shouldn't allow... the guns are the issue, okay?
[00:57:22.282 --> 00:57:23.323]  He says, don't buy guns!
[00:57:23.443 --> 00:57:24.143]  Don't buy guns!
[00:57:24.564 --> 00:57:25.264]  Don't buy guns!
[00:57:25.364 --> 00:57:27.306]  Three times he said, guns are the killers.
[00:57:27.726 --> 00:57:33.371]  No, you need to take some personal responsibility, especially if you're the dad of a mass killer.
[00:57:33.891 --> 00:57:36.453]  And we need to look to see what this guy's background was.
[00:57:36.493 --> 00:57:37.074]  He was on...
[00:57:37.894 --> 00:57:44.318]  He was being treated for psychological issues, and that is what we have seen as the underlying cause.
[00:57:44.678 --> 00:57:45.199]  SSRIs.
[00:57:45.259 --> 00:57:46.459]  Do background checks on those.
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:49.421]  Register people who get SSRIs.
[00:57:49.561 --> 00:57:52.543]  They're the ones who do mass murder suicides.
[00:57:52.563 --> 00:57:53.023]  Stay with us.
[00:57:53.283 --> 00:57:53.944]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:58.536 --> 00:57:59.757]  Another major health threat.
[00:57:59.797 --> 00:58:04.699]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:58:04.779 --> 00:58:07.400]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:14.222]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:58:14.483 --> 00:58:17.344]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:58:17.484 --> 00:58:20.425]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:58:20.525 --> 00:58:22.426]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:58:22.446 --> 00:58:25.267]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:58:25.367 --> 00:58:30.889]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:34.590]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:58:34.610 --> 00:58:37.591]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:58:37.711 --> 00:58:44.793]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:58:45.013 --> 00:58:48.074]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[00:58:48.234 --> 00:58:54.496]  Go to infowarsstore.com today to purchase your ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System.
[00:58:54.616 --> 00:58:57.117]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:59.398 --> 00:59:04.879]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:59:05.139 --> 00:59:19.584]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:59:19.844 --> 00:59:27.748]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:59:27.848 --> 00:59:33.130]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:36.792]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:59:36.972 --> 00:59:40.974]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:59:41.114 --> 00:59:44.976]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:59:45.416 --> 00:59:46.557]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:12.074 --> 01:00:18.081]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:18.701 --> 01:00:21.725]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:23.166 --> 01:00:28.292]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:28.332 --> 01:00:29.573]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:00:30.234 --> 01:00:32.436]  We're going to talk about Obama's
[01:00:33.527 --> 01:00:39.269]  Hinting at gun control, actually at confiscation, way beyond gun control.
[01:00:39.329 --> 01:00:41.269]  Now they're hinting at confiscation.
[01:00:41.889 --> 01:00:44.310]  We also have this article that came out at New American.
[01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:48.491]  It's a creepy new US Army patch, a pro-Islamic symbol.
[01:00:48.551 --> 01:00:51.012]  If you look at this picture, it's absolutely amazing.
[01:00:51.052 --> 01:00:58.194]  On the one side, they have crossed scimitars in a circle that is actually the emblem of the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:00:58.934 --> 01:01:05.978]  And on the right, we have a cross scimitars of the US Army in a new patch that they just put out.
[01:01:06.039 --> 01:01:17.426]  And of course, when we look at what's going on in Syria, and we're going to look at that also this hour, what's going on in Syria, you have to ask yourself, what are we doing there?
[01:01:18.186 --> 01:01:22.410]  We look at the response of Russia and the back and forth between Russia and the United States.
[01:01:22.691 --> 01:01:28.677]  This article from Infowars.com, quote, they're hopping mad in the US and in Saudi Arabia.
[01:01:28.697 --> 01:01:32.761]  And of course that is a comment from a Syrian ambassador.
[01:01:34.282 --> 01:01:35.664]  We have to look at what's going on there.
[01:01:35.684 --> 01:01:39.287]  We have to look at our ally in the area, Saudi Arabia.
[01:01:39.407 --> 01:01:39.808]  And of course,
[01:01:41.634 --> 01:01:48.156]  Prime Minister Cameron has come in from the UK and said, this is an evil man that we're coming after.
[01:01:48.216 --> 01:01:51.457]  This is a horrible man, Assad, that we have to get out.
[01:01:52.017 --> 01:01:59.659]  Now, he may very well be, but I can tell you that I'm not seeing him beheading people in the streets like our ally Saudi Arabia.
[01:02:00.419 --> 01:02:07.105]  I'm not seeing Syria invading other countries like Saudi Arabia, our ally, has in Yemen.
[01:02:07.625 --> 01:02:12.609]  And so you have to ask yourself, when you see this creepy new army patch, where we've got U.S.
[01:02:12.649 --> 01:02:23.098]  soldiers now with an emblem that looks exactly like the Muslim Brotherhood with crossed scimitars, and supposedly that's for the people that are going to be fighting ISIS.
[01:02:24.379 --> 01:02:26.581]  I really have to question what's going on.
[01:02:27.222 --> 01:02:34.409]  And at the same time that Obama is talking about gun confiscation, we have him attacking a hospital.
[01:02:34.969 --> 01:02:40.574]  This is what our military has done in the last day or so in Afghanistan.
[01:02:40.614 --> 01:02:44.158]  There was a massive attack on a hospital there, killing 19 people.
[01:02:45.919 --> 01:03:03.349]  So, you have to ask yourself, when we have an Oregon shooter who kills nine people that he singled out as Christians, we have a President shooter who just killed 19 people, singled out in a hospital, because some of the people in the hospital were Taliban patients.
[01:03:04.619 --> 01:03:08.703]  That doesn't justify it, except in the eyes of the U.S.
[01:03:08.783 --> 01:03:09.384]  military.
[01:03:10.204 --> 01:03:12.126]  And that is very, very concerning.
[01:03:12.146 --> 01:03:15.569]  You have to understand, you don't attack hospitals.
[01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:18.392]  You don't shoot Red Cross vehicles.
[01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:20.234]  You don't shoot medics.
[01:03:20.654 --> 01:03:24.137]  Those are the rules, the laws of international war.
[01:03:24.618 --> 01:03:27.621]  There is a point at which we are supposed to pull this back.
[01:03:28.592 --> 01:03:29.413]  But not the U.S.
[01:03:29.433 --> 01:03:29.793]  military.
[01:03:29.833 --> 01:03:31.374]  This was not a single strike.
[01:03:31.414 --> 01:03:32.755]  We're going to talk about what happened.
[01:03:32.835 --> 01:03:35.537]  It went on for over a half hour.
[01:03:36.118 --> 01:03:38.019]  And we have an article up on Infowars.com.
[01:03:38.379 --> 01:03:40.381]  Patients were burning in their beds.
[01:03:40.561 --> 01:03:44.144]  Witnesses recall the horrific Kunduz Hospital airstrike.
[01:03:45.265 --> 01:03:51.630]  How can a president get on a moral high horse and talk about a shooting
[01:03:53.815 --> 01:04:01.464]  In a college where they singled out Christians and say we need to take guns from innocent people when they do this sort of thing.
[01:04:02.485 --> 01:04:04.627]  Absolutely amazing, the hypocrisy.
[01:04:05.148 --> 01:04:09.893]  Maybe we should have some background checks for president instead of gun owners.
[01:04:10.754 --> 01:04:13.156]  Maybe there ought to be a waiting period for wars.
[01:04:14.264 --> 01:04:21.832]  Maybe there ought to be a process by which we declare war instead of just having the president go out and do it as a dictator.
[01:04:21.852 --> 01:04:22.853]  Yeah, we have a constitution.
[01:04:22.893 --> 01:04:26.417]  We have a constitutional law that he violates on a regular basis.
[01:04:26.858 --> 01:04:32.203]  We also have international laws against war crimes, which they also violate.
[01:04:32.984 --> 01:04:46.351]  I want to talk briefly about what's going on in the polls, of course, and we're going to cover some of what's happening with some of the politicians, as well as their responses to this shooting, because that's part of the background check for president.
[01:04:47.032 --> 01:04:54.496]  And this is one of the very few issues on which there is a substantive difference between the two major political parties.
[01:04:54.556 --> 01:04:56.437]  On most of them, they're exactly the same.
[01:04:57.097 --> 01:05:01.781]  On the war in Syria, on ISIS, the policy is exactly the same.
[01:05:01.841 --> 01:05:03.202]  But on this, there's a difference.
[01:05:03.222 --> 01:05:04.583]  And we're going to talk about that when we come back.
[01:05:04.623 --> 01:05:04.983]  Stay with us.
[01:05:09.304 --> 01:05:10.105]  Alex Jones here.

[01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:30.139]  We need to be self-sufficient.
[01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:35.423]  And if you don't have high-quality, long-lasting, storable foods, I believe you're making a huge mistake.

[01:06:08.644 --> 01:06:15.445]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[01:06:16.386 --> 01:06:17.926]  Government is the problem.
[01:06:20.888 --> 01:06:27.696]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.
[01:06:28.597 --> 01:06:35.785]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[01:06:36.666 --> 01:06:38.408]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:38.809 --> 01:06:41.692]  Because there is a war on, for your mind.
[01:06:43.677 --> 01:06:47.286]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:47.346 --> 01:06:50.133]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Sunday, October 4th, 2015.
[01:06:52.361 --> 01:06:55.402]  We've been talking about the responses to the shooting in Oregon.
[01:06:55.442 --> 01:06:58.803]  We're also going to talk about the shooting in Afghanistan.
[01:06:58.823 --> 01:07:05.204]  The shooting of a hospital by our president, who gets on his moral high horse and says that we need to confiscate guns.
[01:07:05.224 --> 01:07:06.204]  That's what he's hinting at.
[01:07:06.244 --> 01:07:08.905]  We have an article at Infowars.com talking about that.
[01:07:09.205 --> 01:07:12.706]  I want to break down a little bit more of what's going on in Oregon.
[01:07:12.746 --> 01:07:15.446]  Of course, we have the article at Infowars.com.
[01:07:15.466 --> 01:07:17.147]  So the Oregon shooters' guns were legal.
[01:07:17.647 --> 01:07:18.007]  Now what?
[01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:19.689]  Change the gun law?
[01:07:19.749 --> 01:07:23.912]  Well, you know, if you're going to change the gun laws, you need to change the Second Amendment.
[01:07:24.553 --> 01:07:35.362]  We've had a lot of gun laws that have been put on that are in violation of the Second Amendment already, because the Second Amendment says you shall not infringe the Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms.
[01:07:36.363 --> 01:07:42.170]  Infringe means that you're going to erase it by chipping away with it at the edges, okay?
[01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:51.560]  Like moving your fence onto your neighbor's property, and if it gets left there for a long period of time, the law says, well, he's accepted that, and so now that property is yours.
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.022]  So then you move it a little bit farther.
[01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:54.724]  That's the process of infringement.
[01:07:54.884 --> 01:07:58.887]  That's the way they've been destroying the right to keep and bear arms.
[01:07:58.967 --> 01:07:59.687]  It's not a privilege.
[01:07:59.887 --> 01:08:02.329]  It's not something that is created by the Second Amendment.
[01:08:02.369 --> 01:08:05.931]  It is something that is a fundamental right we possess as humans.
[01:08:06.752 --> 01:08:09.013]  And that was set up as a prohibition to government.
[01:08:09.053 --> 01:08:14.097]  So, if you're going to enact gun laws, you've got to get rid of the Second Amendment.
[01:08:14.157 --> 01:08:18.900]  But, of course, we have a government that doesn't believe that they're bound by the Constitution that they take an oath to.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:29.610]  The Constitution that they appeal to for their authority they constantly violate, whether it's the Fourth Amendment or the Second Amendment or the First Amendment, as they are doing in many instances.
[01:08:30.251 --> 01:08:40.280]  We have a government that has created a massive war here on our own citizens, a war on drugs that they have absolutely no constitutional authority for.
[01:08:41.121 --> 01:08:45.525]  Go back and look at the constitutional amendment that was necessary to prohibit alcohol.
[01:08:45.605 --> 01:08:49.929]  Where is the corresponding amendment to prohibit any of these things that they prohibit?
[01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:54.674]  Whether it's marijuana, or cocaine, or cancer drugs.
[01:08:56.129 --> 01:08:59.512]  Everything is prohibited unless it is expressly permitted by our government.
[01:08:59.833 --> 01:09:01.274]  That is not the Constitution.
[01:09:01.834 --> 01:09:05.658]  We had a government at one point in time that recognized the authority of the Constitution.
[01:09:05.998 --> 01:09:12.705]  They knew that they needed to have an amendment to the Constitution to give them the power to regulate and prohibit alcohol.
[01:09:13.045 --> 01:09:13.926]  And then they repealed that.
[01:09:14.206 --> 01:09:14.887]  And there is no
[01:09:16.468 --> 01:09:20.270]  Constitutional amendment that gives them the power to prohibit drugs.
[01:09:20.310 --> 01:09:21.270]  So they just ignore it.
[01:09:21.330 --> 01:09:27.353]  So we could have the same thing happen with firearms, even though we have a Second Amendment that prohibits that.
[01:09:27.413 --> 01:09:39.858]  Just like we have the government constantly violating our Fourth Amendment rights with the TSA and other intrusions by the NSA looking at all the information of individuals without search warrants.
[01:09:40.831 --> 01:09:43.574]  But of course, Obama mocks gun rights activists.
[01:09:43.594 --> 01:09:45.896]  This is another article at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:46.196 --> 01:09:48.899]  Says that they are crackpot conspiracy theories.
[01:09:48.939 --> 01:09:56.586]  He says, they think that any gun safety measures are somehow an assault on freedom, or communistic, or a plot by me.
[01:09:57.537 --> 01:10:01.698]  Well, where would we get the idea that gun control was communistic?
[01:10:02.378 --> 01:10:07.300]  Would it be that Chairman Mao said that power comes out of the barrel of a gun?
[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:12.761]  Would it be that authoritarian governments have always begun by confiscating guns?
[01:10:13.901 --> 01:10:18.663]  We did a video in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting here at InfoWars.
[01:10:18.683 --> 01:10:22.744]  We talked about democide, the long history of death by government.
[01:10:23.646 --> 01:10:30.789]  We showed how gun control preceded massive purges of the civilizations by the governments themselves.
[01:10:30.809 --> 01:10:35.311]  The governments would turn against their citizens, first taking away their guns.
[01:10:35.932 --> 01:10:38.573]  And now we have Obama hinting at confiscation.
[01:10:38.633 --> 01:10:42.315]  He says, we know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting,
[01:10:42.935 --> 01:10:49.722]  Have been able to craft laws that almost, he doesn't even say that they eliminated shootings, he says they almost eliminate mass shootings.
[01:10:49.762 --> 01:10:50.643]  Because you know what, folks?
[01:10:51.124 --> 01:10:57.470]  You do have mass shootings in places like Great Britain, Australia, and countries like ours.
[01:10:57.490 --> 01:11:02.155]  He goes on to say, those countries, they did not eliminate mass shootings, you can still have them there.
[01:11:02.195 --> 01:11:03.857]  Because if you're the only person with a gun,
[01:11:04.818 --> 01:11:06.640]  Then everyone is helpless.
[01:11:07.421 --> 01:11:09.183]  But he is hinting broadly at that.
[01:11:10.043 --> 01:11:11.965]  Here's some facts, okay?
[01:11:12.506 --> 01:11:15.909]  This is from the Breitbart article that talks about that quote.
[01:11:16.450 --> 01:11:19.994]  And they mention how in 1994, the number of firearms was 192 million in private hands.
[01:11:20.014 --> 01:11:21.215]  In 2009, that increased to 310 million.
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:29.002]  What happened to murder by firearm?
[01:11:29.423 --> 01:11:30.844]  Well, it went from 6.6 per 100,000 in 1993 to 3.2 in 2011.
[01:11:31.084 --> 01:11:33.166]  So let me recap that for you, those numbers.
[01:11:33.186 --> 01:11:34.167]  We had a 60% increase in private firearms.
[01:11:34.187 --> 01:11:35.568]  And we had a 52% decrease in homicide by firearm.
[01:11:35.608 --> 01:11:36.109]  Do you understand?
[01:11:52.785 --> 01:11:57.151]  Increased firearms in private hands, decreased death by firearms.
[01:11:58.333 --> 01:11:59.955]  That is the reality of this.
[01:12:00.015 --> 01:12:05.864]  So, maybe we should have, as I said in the last segment, maybe we should have some background checks for President.
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:10.542]  Maybe we should have waiting periods before they start wars.
[01:12:10.882 --> 01:12:13.763]  Maybe we should actually follow the law, follow the Constitution.
[01:12:14.023 --> 01:12:15.444]  Let's look at some background checks.
[01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:19.846]  Here's what some of the people said about the push for gun control.
[01:12:19.866 --> 01:12:21.127]  This is what Mike Huckabee said.
[01:12:21.627 --> 01:12:22.927]  He said, let's ask this question.
[01:12:23.528 --> 01:12:25.308]  What stopped the shooter in Oregon yesterday?
[01:12:25.368 --> 01:12:26.069]  What stopped him?
[01:12:26.129 --> 01:12:28.050]  He said he was continuing to shoot.
[01:12:28.190 --> 01:12:29.010]  But what stopped him?
[01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:31.631]  It was a police officer with what?
[01:12:32.152 --> 01:12:33.092]  With a conversation?
[01:12:33.612 --> 01:12:34.673]  With a reading from a book?
[01:12:35.461 --> 01:12:38.565]  No, it was a cop with a gun that stopped him.
[01:12:39.166 --> 01:12:50.902]  And Huckabee went on to say, we've got a nation and a world in which people have just obliterated that sense of moral character, of responsibility, and of accountability for their actions.
[01:12:51.122 --> 01:12:52.684]  Nothing exemplifies that better.
[01:12:53.385 --> 01:13:01.194]  ...than the father of this shooter saying that guns kill, don't buy guns, and we need to take away everybody's guns.
[01:13:01.595 --> 01:13:05.659]  Because he won't accept any personal responsibility for the actions of his son.
[01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:18.678]  And if we're going to put any new laws, maybe we should add some kind of financial liability for the parents of people who do this type of thing, because he's not about to accept any personal responsibility.
[01:13:18.798 --> 01:13:22.180]  Here's what Hillary Clinton says in an article on Infowars.com.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:26.563]  Hillary Clinton calls for mass movement to eradicate the Second Amendment.
[01:13:26.623 --> 01:13:28.064]  She says she will never relent.
[01:13:29.298 --> 01:13:31.039]  And what is she not going to relent on?
[01:13:31.359 --> 01:13:36.402]  She's not going to relent in her war on the Bill of Rights because that's fundamentally what we're talking about.
[01:13:36.982 --> 01:13:43.466]  But of course, the way that she and others want to couch this is they want to have a war on the NRA.
[01:13:44.106 --> 01:13:45.407]  Donald Trump went to Tennessee.
[01:13:46.087 --> 01:13:48.748]  And he pushed his Second Amendment protection program.
[01:13:48.768 --> 01:13:50.788]  He had 3,000 people waiting to hear him.
[01:13:50.828 --> 01:13:53.728]  It was a sell-out, standing-room-only crowd.
[01:13:53.768 --> 01:13:57.489]  He had 1,000 people standing outside in the rain to hear him.
[01:13:58.209 --> 01:14:03.650]  And he unabashedly waved a copy of the Second Amendment position paper that he has on his website.
[01:14:03.670 --> 01:14:05.711]  He's got two position papers that are very detailed.
[01:14:05.731 --> 01:14:07.071]  We've talked about these in the past.
[01:14:07.191 --> 01:14:08.051]  One is on immigration.
[01:14:08.791 --> 01:14:11.032]  The Second Amendment was the second one that he put up.
[01:14:11.072 --> 01:14:12.012]  It was on September the 18th.
[01:14:13.112 --> 01:14:15.636]  And I thought there was some stuff in it that was very good.
[01:14:15.736 --> 01:14:19.140]  Some of it, I wasn't too happy with the way that he set it up.
[01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:20.782]  I thought it might be some issues.
[01:14:21.403 --> 01:14:22.785]  But again, you know what?
[01:14:22.885 --> 01:14:24.707]  Overall, I thought it was a great position paper.
[01:14:25.368 --> 01:14:29.834]  The question, again, with any of these candidates is, do they really believe this?
[01:14:30.535 --> 01:14:32.636]  Are they really going to do what they say?
[01:14:32.836 --> 01:14:36.817]  But this is what he's saying, and it is always helpful to have people saying the right thing.
[01:14:37.398 --> 01:14:40.759]  And what Donald Trump said now, this is in the light of what happened in Oregon.
[01:14:40.799 --> 01:14:47.461]  Now every time something happens like this, they don't blame mental illness, that our mental health care is out of whack and all the other problems.
[01:14:47.481 --> 01:14:50.322]  He said, no, by the way, it was a gun-free zone.
[01:14:51.183 --> 01:14:55.765]  Well, it's not just mental illness, and that's one of the things that's tricky about his program.
[01:14:55.785 --> 01:14:56.625]  He did mention that.
[01:14:57.671 --> 01:14:59.031]  A lot of Republicans understand that.
[01:14:59.051 --> 01:15:09.034]  But we have to understand that if people are going to have their firearms taken away because of mental illness, we need to go through a full due process situation.
[01:15:09.054 --> 01:15:13.396]  We don't need to have that done on the orders of one psychiatrist.
[01:15:14.196 --> 01:15:21.218]  It needs to be treated as if you were taking away somebody's property, or if you're putting them in jail.
[01:15:21.258 --> 01:15:22.959]  They need to have full process.
[01:15:22.979 --> 01:15:24.299]  They need to have a jury trial.
[01:15:24.879 --> 01:15:26.840]  They need to have a lawyer present in that.
[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:29.661]  If they have due process, I don't have a problem with that.
[01:15:30.001 --> 01:15:36.643]  I think that is a very dangerous thing to take people's firearms away, though, on the orders of a single doctor.
[01:15:36.663 --> 01:15:37.863]  We've seen how that's been pushed.
[01:15:38.323 --> 01:15:44.046]  In the VA administration saying that people were incompetent merely because they had their checks automatically deposited.
[01:15:44.086 --> 01:15:44.946]  They used that.
[01:15:45.026 --> 01:15:45.967]  That's how bad it can get.
[01:15:46.467 --> 01:15:47.828]  So we have to be careful about that.
[01:15:48.708 --> 01:15:50.529]  Now we have, and this is one more reaction.
[01:15:50.569 --> 01:15:51.950]  I want to talk about this when we come back.
[01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:58.973]  Joe Biden says that you don't have a right in the Second Amendment to use a bazooka or a fighter jet.
[01:15:59.593 --> 01:16:00.794]  That's not what this is about.
[01:16:00.834 --> 01:16:06.016]  But we're going to talk about somebody who is a terrorist who terrorized the hospital using jet fighters when we come back.
[01:16:06.076 --> 01:16:07.417]  That will be President Obama.
[01:16:08.377 --> 01:16:13.379]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:53.613]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.

[01:18:08.917 --> 01:18:13.003]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[01:18:13.223 --> 01:18:17.428]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[01:18:17.468 --> 01:18:24.758]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[01:18:24.918 --> 01:18:35.448]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[01:18:35.588 --> 01:18:38.931]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[01:18:39.131 --> 01:18:40.152]  What do you have to lose?

[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:51.861]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[01:18:51.981 --> 01:18:56.003]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[01:18:56.183 --> 01:18:58.304]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[01:18:58.484 --> 01:19:05.448]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.

[01:20:50.755 --> 01:20:53.556]  You're hosted on this Sunday, October 4th, 2015.
[01:20:53.856 --> 01:20:59.177]  The last segment, I was talking about some of the comments of various politicians.
[01:20:59.257 --> 01:21:04.579]  Of course, Hillary Clinton says she's never going to relent in her attack on guns.
[01:21:05.659 --> 01:21:07.419]  That's on the Second Amendment, folks.
[01:21:07.439 --> 01:21:11.200]  That's what she's going to never relent on, is her attack on our rights.
[01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:13.241]  Obama is hinting at
[01:21:14.441 --> 01:21:25.148]  All out confiscation as being the only solution because of course there weren't any laws violated in the possession of this shooters guns So we just have to get rid of them all together.
[01:21:25.168 --> 01:21:26.089]  That's Obama's position.
[01:21:26.129 --> 01:21:43.781]  I read you a couple of comments from Republican candidates Huckabee who talked about personal responsibility who talked about the fact that he was stopped not with ideas Not with a reading not with a book, but he was stopped with a cop with a gun stopping him But of course actually he committed suicide, but that would have stopped him
[01:21:44.441 --> 01:21:45.562]  Much, much earlier.
[01:21:46.482 --> 01:21:51.605]  This went on for at least 10 minutes before the shooter, we're told, committed suicide.
[01:21:51.625 --> 01:22:00.391]  And then we have the craziest response, and that was from Joe Biden, who takes the assault weapon scare tactics to all new levels.
[01:22:00.431 --> 01:22:04.133]  I'll tell you what he had to say about that and how this is reflected
[01:22:04.873 --> 01:22:08.974]  And what our own president is pushing in Afghanistan.
[01:22:09.094 --> 01:22:16.056]  In just one moment before we do, I want to let you know that this hour the Alex Jones Show is brought to you by products that we sell at Infowarslife.com.
[01:22:16.096 --> 01:22:17.997]  Products like Brain Force.
[01:22:18.397 --> 01:22:20.538]  This is something that I use all the time.
[01:22:20.558 --> 01:22:20.758]  I found
[01:22:21.858 --> 01:22:26.742]  More than any of the other products, I have found that I can feel the effects of this.
[01:22:27.442 --> 01:22:30.385]  This is something that's different from energy drinks, it's different from supplements.
[01:22:30.785 --> 01:22:36.369]  It uses natural brain activation ingredients, things like Yerba Mate extract, Alpha GPC.
[01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:42.193]  It already has hundreds of five-star reviews that you can read on InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:22:42.493 --> 01:22:44.954]  These are certified reviews by a third-party review system.
[01:22:44.974 --> 01:22:47.175]  Let me read you a couple of those about BrainForce.
[01:22:47.636 --> 01:22:50.897]  This one is from Whaler Matt in Cincinnati, Ohio.
[01:22:50.937 --> 01:22:52.178]  He said, this stuff is amazing.
[01:22:52.698 --> 01:22:57.061]  In terms of computer ease, it's like upgrading from a dual-core to a quad-core.
[01:22:57.501 --> 01:22:59.843]  More pipelines in the brain are open to multitask.
[01:22:59.883 --> 01:23:02.905]  I find myself not wondering in conversations when talking to others.
[01:23:03.365 --> 01:23:06.388]  No harsh letdown like caffeine or energy drinks.
[01:23:07.148 --> 01:23:08.729]  Another one from Jonathan in Fort Worth.
[01:23:08.769 --> 01:23:12.552]  He said, this product is one of the main reasons I outperform all of my co-workers.
[01:23:12.692 --> 01:23:13.593]  I work in a call center.
[01:23:14.053 --> 01:23:18.714]  And I always finish the day with a better report than anyone else, and I have brain force to thank for that.
[01:23:18.774 --> 01:23:19.874]  So, take a look at it.
[01:23:19.934 --> 01:23:24.916]  See people who say that they found it useful or didn't find it useful.
[01:23:24.956 --> 01:23:25.756]  Most people did.
[01:23:26.356 --> 01:23:29.517]  As I said, it's got hundreds of five-star reviews there.
[01:23:30.357 --> 01:23:31.537]  And you can get that right now.
[01:23:31.617 --> 01:23:34.158]  It's in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[01:23:34.578 --> 01:23:36.539]  It's something that I really do like.
[01:23:36.579 --> 01:23:38.539]  It's one of the products that I use the most.
[01:23:39.539 --> 01:23:42.060]  Now, going back to what Joe Biden said.
[01:23:43.171 --> 01:23:46.612]  Liberals have always used the phrase assault weapons.
[01:23:46.692 --> 01:23:51.694]  Never really defining what an assault weapon is, but I guess maybe now we have a definition from Joe Biden.
[01:23:51.734 --> 01:23:54.715]  He says the Second Amendment doesn't say you can own a bazooka.
[01:23:55.076 --> 01:23:58.217]  It doesn't say you could own an F-15 with Hellfire missiles.
[01:23:58.257 --> 01:23:58.617]  There you go.
[01:23:58.657 --> 01:24:00.017]  He's taken it to all new levels.
[01:24:00.998 --> 01:24:08.661]  Let me explain something to Joe Biden, because I remember when the Clarence Thomas hearings were going on that he had the biggest problem
[01:24:09.588 --> 01:24:12.431]  With Clarence Thomas' writings about natural law.
[01:24:13.372 --> 01:24:17.316]  Joe Biden doesn't think that you have any natural rights.
[01:24:18.017 --> 01:24:21.180]  Joe Biden thinks that you have government-granted privileges.
[01:24:21.421 --> 01:24:22.462]  You see how he phrased this?
[01:24:22.522 --> 01:24:24.744]  First of all, it's ridiculous, okay?
[01:24:25.104 --> 01:24:31.571]  There wasn't a bazooka or a jet plane used in this shooting that he's trying to piggyback his political agenda on.
[01:24:32.412 --> 01:24:36.393]  But he takes it from the standpoint, the Second Amendment doesn't say you can.
[01:24:37.014 --> 01:24:37.174]  No.
[01:24:37.854 --> 01:24:40.495]  The Second Amendment is not about giving us privileges.
[01:24:40.755 --> 01:24:42.475]  It's not about telling us what we can do.
[01:24:42.675 --> 01:24:45.196]  It's about telling the government what it cannot do.
[01:24:45.816 --> 01:24:54.579]  And that is infringe on our fundamental rights to protect ourselves from criminals, whether they're individual criminals or whether they're criminals in the government.
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.500]  And let me tell you something.
[01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:03.024]  Military weapons are protected by the Second Amendment.
[01:25:04.105 --> 01:25:06.367]  Muskets were state-of-the-art weapons.
[01:25:06.667 --> 01:25:12.012]  It wasn't something that a different class of arms that the citizens were allowed to have.
[01:25:12.092 --> 01:25:16.375]  No, they relied on a citizen militia, not a permanent standing army.
[01:25:17.369 --> 01:25:29.315]  That was one of the designs of our country, that we were going to be protected from foreign invasion, from insurrection internally, from tyranny internally, by an armed citizen militia that would have everything that they needed to protect themselves.
[01:25:30.236 --> 01:25:40.842]  Those who were disarmed at Concord and Lexington by the British had not only muskets, they also had cannons, and that's what began the Revolutionary War.
[01:25:41.877 --> 01:25:44.958]  So don't talk to me about what we're allowed to have.
[01:25:45.158 --> 01:25:51.361]  Let's talk about whether or not we have a president who is capable of controlling guns.
[01:25:51.521 --> 01:25:54.462]  Whether we have a president who's capable of controlling the military.
[01:25:55.302 --> 01:25:56.303]  We have U.S.
[01:25:56.423 --> 01:26:06.708]  officials investigating an airstrike in Afghanistan, they say, this is on Fox News, that killed at least 19 doctors at a Doctors Without Borders hospital.
[01:26:07.549 --> 01:26:14.193]  Taliban fighters were among those that were in the hospital, so this is a possible motive of the Defense Department.
[01:26:15.134 --> 01:26:28.820]  We know that when WikiLeaks showed via the file that Manning got and then published through WikiLeaks, we saw the military killing at a distance people on the ground.
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:31.681]  We saw them shooting a guy carrying a camera.
[01:26:31.721 --> 01:26:34.703]  We saw them strafing an ambulance when it came up.
[01:26:35.443 --> 01:26:36.384]  What did our government do?
[01:26:37.164 --> 01:26:38.785]  Did it punish the soldiers that did that?
[01:26:39.085 --> 01:26:41.126]  Did it punish the soldiers that laughed about that?
[01:26:41.889 --> 01:26:44.651]  Did it punish their commanders for not doing anything about it?
[01:26:44.771 --> 01:26:44.971]  No.
[01:26:45.792 --> 01:26:47.112]  They put Manning in jail.
[01:26:47.953 --> 01:26:50.595]  They tried to put Julian Assange in jail.
[01:26:51.175 --> 01:26:56.098]  And so now we have defense officials saying we, quote, regret the loss of innocent life.
[01:26:56.839 --> 01:27:04.344]  They say the incident could have been avoided, however, if the Taliban had not used the hospital as a base and the civilians there as human shields.
[01:27:04.864 --> 01:27:06.045]  That's not what happened.
[01:27:07.455 --> 01:27:16.178]  It is reported by the New York Times that this was pointed out to all combatants there, both sides, that this was a hospital.
[01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:19.079]  It is a war crime to shoot ambulances.
[01:27:19.439 --> 01:27:22.320]  It is a war crime to shoot up the Red Cross, to shoot up a medic.
[01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:26.461]  This is why they have at least 19 people, three of them reportedly children.
[01:27:27.301 --> 01:27:28.942]  This is from a senior UN official.
[01:27:29.502 --> 01:27:31.463]  Equated this to a war crime.
[01:27:31.483 --> 01:27:40.046]  The New York Times reports they were assaulted from the air for 30 to 45 minutes, resulting in a large fire that burned some patients to death in their beds.
[01:27:40.646 --> 01:27:45.988]  Among those killed were 12 of the charity group's staff members, said the Doctors Without Borders.
[01:27:46.488 --> 01:27:50.910]  They say the event is utterly tragic, inexcusable, and possibly even criminal.
[01:27:50.950 --> 01:27:53.232]  That is from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
[01:27:53.272 --> 01:28:01.076]  He added, if established as deliberate in a court of law, an airstrike on a hospital may amount to a war crime.
[01:28:01.136 --> 01:28:02.637]  This is from our government.
[01:28:03.137 --> 01:28:07.963]  Who is pontificating now about this shooting saying they need to take away our weapons.
[01:28:08.063 --> 01:28:14.810]  Perhaps we need to take away some of the power from our president and from the military who did this.
[01:28:15.211 --> 01:28:22.840]  They say the bombing continued for more than 30 minutes after American and Afghan military officials in Kabul and Washington were informed.
[01:28:23.956 --> 01:28:29.642]  They say 12 Doctors Without Borders staff members were killed along with seven patients, again, three of them children.
[01:28:30.243 --> 01:28:32.886]  And we have the article up on Infowars.com.
[01:28:33.186 --> 01:28:34.868]  Patients were burning in their beds.
[01:28:35.289 --> 01:28:38.672]  Witnesses recall the horrific Kunduz hospital airstrikes.
[01:28:39.153 --> 01:28:39.994]  Here's what one of the
[01:28:41.235 --> 01:28:51.999]  Communication said they added that precise locations of its facilities had been communicated to all parties in the military conflict on multiple occasions, with the latest communication being on September 29th.
[01:28:52.239 --> 01:28:54.420]  The bombs, they said, were very precise.
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:56.401]  The planes continued to circle around.
[01:28:56.441 --> 01:28:58.581]  They continued the attack for 30 minutes.
[01:28:58.621 --> 01:29:00.282]  This was not one mistake.
[01:29:00.382 --> 01:29:03.443]  They were very precise and a continued attack for 30 minutes.
[01:29:03.703 --> 01:29:04.684]  This is a war crime.
[01:29:05.024 --> 01:29:05.504]  Stay with us.
[01:29:05.764 --> 01:29:08.045]  We'll be right back and we're going to talk about what's going on in Syria.
[01:29:08.365 --> 01:29:12.186]  Just when you think the government couldn't get any more ludicrous, the U.S.
[01:29:12.246 --> 01:29:19.948]  Environmental Protection Agency has taken to social media to point out the harmful effects of sunny days on plant life.
[01:29:20.148 --> 01:29:20.688]  That's right.
[01:29:20.868 --> 01:29:23.969]  The agency tweeted, Think sunny days are good for plants?
[01:29:24.289 --> 01:29:24.930]  Not always.
[01:29:25.210 --> 01:29:29.751]  Sunlight causes ozone to form, which harms foliage and weakens trees.
[01:29:30.231 --> 01:29:36.212]  Makes you wonder how did the planet survive for millennia before a big bloated government came along to protect it?
[01:29:36.512 --> 01:29:47.535]  Let's just point out the absurdity of the EPA highlighting the alleged danger of sunlight as the world is facing numerous legitimate environmental issues, some of which have been caused by the agency itself.
[01:29:47.715 --> 01:29:57.177]  Let's not forget this is the same agency that polluted the Animas River with more than 3 million gallons of toxic waste last month in an effort to cover up that disaster.
[01:29:57.657 --> 01:30:01.758]  EPA officials refused to provide data to the press on the extent of the damage.
[01:30:02.079 --> 01:30:07.821]  Read the article, Obama's EPA warns sunlight dangerous to plants at InfoWars.com.
[01:30:09.321 --> 01:30:18.344]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:30:18.404 --> 01:30:26.527]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:30:26.807 --> 01:30:31.490]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:30:31.670 --> 01:30:38.394]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:30:38.474 --> 01:30:45.558]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:30:45.658 --> 01:30:52.502]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:30:52.662 --> 01:30:57.026]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:32:07.863 --> 01:32:12.326]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:32:12.606 --> 01:32:17.449]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:32:17.449 --> 01:32:18.129]  I don't know.
[01:32:39.033 --> 01:32:39.953]  BrainForce is here.
[01:32:40.154 --> 01:32:42.234]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:32:42.354 --> 01:32:47.097]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:32:47.337 --> 01:32:50.498]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:32:50.638 --> 01:32:53.840]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:55.920]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:32:56.101 --> 01:32:58.021]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:32:58.201 --> 01:33:00.082]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:33:00.202 --> 01:33:05.725]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[01:33:38.445 --> 01:33:39.866]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:40.126 --> 01:33:41.286]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:41.787 --> 01:33:46.309]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:48.450 --> 01:33:49.830]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:49.870 --> 01:33:52.532]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Sunday, October 4th, 2015.
[01:33:52.772 --> 01:33:55.413]  We have an article up on InfoWars.com.
[01:33:55.853 --> 01:33:58.854]  Quote, they're hopping mad in the US and Saudi Arabia.
[01:33:58.914 --> 01:34:00.695]  That is a Syrian legislator.
[01:34:01.236 --> 01:34:03.917]  And he's talking about Russian strikes in Syria.
[01:34:05.014 --> 01:34:05.755]  The U.S.
[01:34:06.255 --> 01:34:11.078]  media, the Western governments, are pushing back against this.
[01:34:11.098 --> 01:34:20.724]  And many people are asking, well, why didn't they do this years ago when we had the pictures of the convoy of Jeeps and light weapons stringing for miles?
[01:34:20.925 --> 01:34:24.567]  One A-10 Warthog could have taken those guys out and they didn't do anything.
[01:34:25.468 --> 01:34:30.131]  But we have Obama saying that the Russian airstrikes are strengthening ISIS.
[01:34:31.212 --> 01:34:31.732]  Is that true?
[01:34:32.513 --> 01:34:41.379]  If it really makes them stronger, then why would Obama bomb a hospital in Afghanistan because it's got a couple of Taliban fighters in it?
[01:34:42.179 --> 01:34:45.442]  Unapologetically saying, well, they shouldn't have Taliban fighters there.
[01:34:46.274 --> 01:34:48.375]  And again, they knew it was a hospital.
[01:34:48.395 --> 01:34:50.317]  They continued the attack for over 30 minutes.
[01:34:50.357 --> 01:34:53.319]  We had 19 people killed, three of them children.
[01:34:53.799 --> 01:34:56.200]  People were burning to death in their beds.
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:57.741]  They could not get out of there.
[01:34:57.801 --> 01:35:00.543]  But of course, we're allied with Saudi Arabia.
[01:35:00.923 --> 01:35:05.026]  They're trying to make a case for Assad being the most evil man on the planet.
[01:35:05.046 --> 01:35:06.687]  That's always the case whenever we go to war.
[01:35:08.356 --> 01:35:12.418]  You always have to make the bad guy a strongman Noriega.
[01:35:12.838 --> 01:35:16.581]  Or you have Saddam Hussein who is taking babies off of ventilators.
[01:35:16.701 --> 01:35:18.402]  All these things lies, of course.
[01:35:19.062 --> 01:35:25.505]  People who were previous partners of our CIA, then they become the villains when the time is right to get rid of these people.
[01:35:25.525 --> 01:35:27.847]  But what's going on right now in Syria?
[01:35:28.787 --> 01:35:31.650]  This article we have on Infowars.com is from Zero Hedge.
[01:35:31.730 --> 01:35:36.675]  It says, two days, and this is two days ago, we're now two days into Russia's air campaign.
[01:35:37.116 --> 01:35:40.179]  Both Moscow and the West are rushing to spin the narrative.
[01:35:40.219 --> 01:35:40.660]  Very true.
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:41.621]  He says, the U.S.
[01:35:41.681 --> 01:35:47.967]  is portraying Russian airstrikes as supportive of a murderous regime and an imminent threat to civilians is key.
[01:35:47.987 --> 01:35:49.328]  Now this is the same
[01:35:50.029 --> 01:35:52.110]  Government says this is a threat to civilians.
[01:35:52.130 --> 01:35:54.170]  The Russians are possibly going to kill civilians.
[01:35:54.350 --> 01:36:00.472]  This is the same administration that just bombed a hospital for 30 minutes in Afghanistan.
[01:36:00.912 --> 01:36:03.513]  That's how concerned they are about civilian casualties.
[01:36:04.213 --> 01:36:07.034]  They go on and say in the article, the notion that the US
[01:36:08.103 --> 01:36:26.767]  has now finally managed to identify the quote-unquote good guys in Syria after failing to get it right for four years and that now evil Russia is deliberately targeting those good guys simply because they're the good guys is laughable to the point one wonders if CNN and others pushed back on being compelled to spin it that way.
[01:36:26.787 --> 01:36:35.129]  It's such a ridiculous narrative and this of course is what the lawmaker says he says they're hopping mad in Saudi Arabia the US and Qatar because of their defeat
[01:36:35.649 --> 01:36:39.390]  And because of the victory of Russia and Syria and the unraveling of the fact that the U.S.
[01:36:39.450 --> 01:36:42.952]  and its allies are not serious about fighting ISIS.
[01:36:44.032 --> 01:36:45.373]  That's the takeaway, folks.
[01:36:45.613 --> 01:36:47.093]  We're not serious about fighting them.
[01:36:47.393 --> 01:36:48.914]  We created them.
[01:36:49.194 --> 01:36:51.355]  We could have taken them out at any point.
[01:36:51.835 --> 01:36:55.196]  And that's the point that Putin is making when he talks about this.
[01:36:55.236 --> 01:36:58.137]  But here's what Obama had to say when he went to the U.N.
[01:36:58.157 --> 01:36:58.918]  Let's play that clip.
[01:36:59.578 --> 01:37:04.840]  ISIL has now lost nearly a third of the populated areas in Iraq that it had controlled.
[01:37:06.054 --> 01:37:14.100]  Eighteen countries are now helping to train and support Iraqi forces, including Sunni volunteers who want to push ISIL out of their communities.
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:26.348]  ISIL has been pushed back from large sections of northeastern Syria, including the key city of Tal Abyad, putting new pressure on its stronghold of Raqqa.
[01:37:27.329 --> 01:37:32.052]  And ISIL has been cut off from almost the entire region bordering Turkey.
[01:37:33.513 --> 01:37:44.125]  Together we're pursuing a comprehensive strategy that is informed by our success over many years in crippling the Al Qaeda core in the tribal regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[01:37:45.006 --> 01:37:47.129]  And we are harnessing all of our tools.
[01:37:48.190 --> 01:37:52.015]  Military, intelligence, economic,
[01:37:53.158 --> 01:37:54.620]  Yeah, really?
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:56.502]  Okay, they're not doing anything, folks.
[01:37:56.562 --> 01:37:58.685]  We know that this has been going on for quite some time.
[01:37:59.065 --> 01:38:06.654]  They tried propaganda methods to start a war by saying that there was a sarin gas attack on people by the Syrian government.
[01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:08.216]  That was totally debunked.
[01:38:08.256 --> 01:38:10.138]  We showed that as a false flag.
[01:38:10.839 --> 01:38:15.484]  And the Russians are pointing out that there is no moderate opposition in Syria.
[01:38:15.524 --> 01:38:17.366]  This is an article on Infowars.com.
[01:38:17.907 --> 01:38:25.215]  They say, I don't think, this is Vladimir Putin's spokesperson, he says, I don't think anyone has yet explained what moderate opposition is.
[01:38:26.067 --> 01:38:34.514]  Putin demonstrated quite active interest in the issue and asked in which way the moderate opposition was different from the M-moderate opposition.
[01:38:34.574 --> 01:38:40.739]  Yeah, remember it was McCain who met with the moderate leaders and now they've outed themselves as ISIS leaders?
[01:38:41.869 --> 01:38:44.190]  Remember that story from about a week and a half ago?
[01:38:44.210 --> 01:38:46.211]  And of course, where did these guys come from?
[01:38:46.231 --> 01:38:56.874]  A lot of these particular leaders that McCain and others met with, they were Chechen jihadis, islamicists, that were being used against Russia.
[01:38:56.934 --> 01:38:59.375]  That's why Russia is upset about this.
[01:38:59.435 --> 01:39:01.316]  Of course, they're allied with Syria.
[01:39:01.356 --> 01:39:03.516]  There's some other geopolitical issues going on.
[01:39:03.537 --> 01:39:07.178]  They've been Syria's ally for a very long time, but they also understand
[01:39:07.938 --> 01:39:12.441]  That Islamic terrorists have been used as proxies for the U.S.
[01:39:12.481 --> 01:39:13.782]  government and the CIA.
[01:39:14.483 --> 01:39:21.408]  We are creating this cancer that is building and metastasizing all over the world and Russia is attacking it.
[01:39:21.548 --> 01:39:23.229]  The very fact that the U.S.
[01:39:23.249 --> 01:39:36.418]  has been caught repeatedly arming and training and bringing these Chechen rebels in to infiltrate Syria and then not attacking them, that is all very telling that they are our cancer that we're trying to unleash on the world.
[01:39:36.838 --> 01:39:37.079]  Why?
[01:39:37.839 --> 01:39:38.719]  So that the U.S.
[01:39:38.999 --> 01:39:42.401]  can have an excuse to build up the military-industrial complex.
[01:39:42.421 --> 01:39:43.561]  They want a new Cold War.
[01:39:43.581 --> 01:39:44.821]  They want a new arms race.
[01:39:45.562 --> 01:39:47.762]  They want an arms race for terrorism.
[01:39:47.802 --> 01:39:50.463]  They want the police surveillance state to ramp up.
[01:39:50.523 --> 01:39:53.084]  So they want there to be a permanent war against terrorists.
[01:39:53.104 --> 01:39:54.725]  So they have to create a terrorist threat.
[01:39:54.785 --> 01:39:58.946]  And now they bring Russia into it because they want to get the big guns out there.
[01:39:59.926 --> 01:40:16.361]  Some of the military-industrial complex, I imagine, is upset because you can't really justify strategic fighter-bombers, you know, the really big ticket items there, you know, as the guy, as George C. Scott said, and Dr. Strangelove, you know, you see these guys come running really low, it's amazing to see it.
[01:40:16.401 --> 01:40:18.523]  Well, it's also amazing to pay for this.
[01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:21.461]  And that's what the military-industrial complex wants.
[01:40:21.501 --> 01:40:26.142]  They want an excuse to have a new Cold War, and they're starting a new Cold War.
[01:40:26.162 --> 01:40:31.224]  But let's look at what's happening in Syria when ISIS, our surrogates, come in.
[01:40:31.664 --> 01:40:38.066]  They have 11 rules for Christians, and these rules sound very much like our ally, Saudi Arabia.
[01:40:38.707 --> 01:40:43.288]  ISIS jihadists have issued 11 commandments for those who are staying in there.
[01:40:43.308 --> 01:40:44.449]  You have to sign a contract.
[01:40:44.469 --> 01:40:47.550]  You have to pay a tax that's imposed on non-Muslims.
[01:40:48.570 --> 01:40:49.631]  Or you can leave, they say.
[01:40:50.031 --> 01:40:54.555]  But of course they have their IDs, so they can't quite leave at the moment.
[01:40:54.575 --> 01:40:55.595]  But here's some of these rules.
[01:40:55.816 --> 01:41:02.941]  They say the stipulations prohibit the establishment of churches, they expose Muslims to Christian religious symbols.
[01:41:02.981 --> 01:41:14.250]  So they don't want to have the establishment of churches, they don't want any exposure of Muslims to Christian religious symbols, and they want to ban possessions of weapons and trading pork or wine.
[01:41:14.770 --> 01:41:18.619]  Now, two of those things sound very much like the Obama administration, don't they?
[01:41:19.401 --> 01:41:24.453]  Ban all Christian religious symbols, okay, and ban possession of weapons.
[01:41:25.265 --> 01:41:34.472]  The only thing that we're not getting from our people, of course, is that Obama and Washington haven't tried to ban trading pork or wine.
[01:41:34.992 --> 01:41:39.035]  But it looks very much like the Democrat platform, these 11 rules from ISIS.
[01:41:39.055 --> 01:41:43.378]  But we have to understand that Saudi Arabia has beheaded more people than ISIS has.
[01:41:44.119 --> 01:41:47.361]  And they have attacked and invaded their neighbor, Yemen.
[01:41:47.821 --> 01:41:49.723]  Massive civilian casualties in Yemen.
[01:41:49.763 --> 01:41:53.545]  Have you heard the American press complaining about what's going on in Yemen?
[01:41:53.726 --> 01:41:53.866]  No.
[01:41:54.810 --> 01:41:57.972]  Have you heard very much about the bombing of the hospital in Afghanistan?
[01:41:58.012 --> 01:41:58.432]  Not really.
[01:41:58.472 --> 01:42:05.437]  But you haven't heard anything about what's going on in Yemen because that's our allies, Saudi Arabia.
[01:42:06.138 --> 01:42:08.119]  Syria is not attacking its neighbors.
[01:42:08.999 --> 01:42:10.100]  It's Saudi Arabia.
[01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:11.221]  Who is the real threat?
[01:42:11.481 --> 01:42:14.723]  And of course, as I mentioned earlier, we've got this creepy new army patch.
[01:42:14.743 --> 01:42:15.964]  This is from New American.
[01:42:16.284 --> 01:42:18.726]  They show the Muslim Brotherhood patch and the U.S.
[01:42:18.846 --> 01:42:22.689]  Army patch, and they both have crossed scimitars on them.
[01:42:22.729 --> 01:42:24.070]  They look very much alike.
[01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:29.413]  These rules, as I pointed out from ISIS, they look very much like Democrat Party platform.
[01:42:29.693 --> 01:42:31.034]  Now, the Russians say that the U.S.
[01:42:31.134 --> 01:42:32.315]  is not bombing ISIS.
[01:42:32.335 --> 01:42:34.856]  This is another article from Infowars.com.
[01:42:35.177 --> 01:42:36.438]  Kurt Nemo pointed this out.
[01:42:36.458 --> 01:42:40.840]  He said, quote, McCain accused us of striking out at U.S.-trained insurgents.
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:46.244]  However, since they've either run away or joined al-Qaeda, hitting them is mission impossible.
[01:42:46.704 --> 01:42:47.104]  I want my baby!
[01:42:47.124 --> 01:42:47.705]  I want my baby again!
[01:42:47.725 --> 01:42:47.885]  Why?
[01:42:47.905 --> 01:42:47.985]  Why?
[01:42:48.005 --> 01:42:48.085]  Why?
[01:43:11.565 --> 01:43:20.948]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:43:21.288 --> 01:43:23.849]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:43:23.869 --> 01:43:27.370]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:33.572]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[01:43:33.872 --> 01:43:38.714]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:43:38.994 --> 01:43:45.179]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.

[01:45:46.996 --> 01:45:50.197]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.

[01:47:04.784 --> 01:47:07.405]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:24.423 --> 01:47:27.926]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:47:28.487 --> 01:47:31.829]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:31.930 --> 01:47:35.513]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:35.573 --> 01:47:36.874]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:47:37.454 --> 01:47:50.946]  In this last segment, I want to talk about some of the things that I saw and experienced in the three cities that, in my perspective, were under martial law, or at least a rehearsal for martial law.
[01:47:52.128 --> 01:48:05.153]  Let's understand that every time they have an event, whether it is a Super Bowl or whether it's a papal visit, it's always an excuse for the government to ramp up its
[01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.850]  Security state.
[01:48:07.230 --> 01:48:09.191]  And that's what we saw in massive amounts.
[01:48:09.271 --> 01:48:11.894]  Philadelphia was just beyond description.
[01:48:12.554 --> 01:48:14.175]  I had to take a little bit of time off.
[01:48:14.255 --> 01:48:16.657]  I was really, really upset.
[01:48:17.358 --> 01:48:18.979]  I felt like I had been in prison.
[01:48:19.059 --> 01:48:20.220]  It was absolutely amazing.
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:26.245]  And of course, the level of security is really not an issue of the Pope.
[01:48:26.305 --> 01:48:27.666]  It's not an issue that I have with the Pope.
[01:48:28.843 --> 01:48:34.705]  I do have, excuse me, issues with the Pope based on what he was doing here.
[01:48:34.805 --> 01:48:38.126]  He wasn't here for a moral message.
[01:48:38.426 --> 01:48:40.726]  No, he was here selling an agenda.
[01:48:40.786 --> 01:48:42.027]  And I want to talk about that.
[01:48:42.087 --> 01:48:52.389]  And I want to talk about some of the people that I met, some of the people that I interviewed there, survivors of sexual abuse by priests as children.
[01:48:52.449 --> 01:48:53.850]  And I have some very, very
[01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:55.030]  Good to go.
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:15.823]  The All Natural Sleep Support, formulated by Infowarslife.com.
[01:49:16.284 --> 01:49:18.065]  I've taken melatonin in the past.
[01:49:18.106 --> 01:49:19.527]  I've used it for jet lag.
[01:49:20.007 --> 01:49:23.430]  I've had benefits from that, but this has a lot more than just melatonin.
[01:49:23.450 --> 01:49:25.012]  It has valerian root extract.
[01:49:25.072 --> 01:49:26.453]  It has melatonin.
[01:49:26.473 --> 01:49:29.115]  It has chamomile flower extract, L-tropophan.
[01:49:29.356 --> 01:49:31.998]  That's the thing that makes you sleepy in Turkey.
[01:49:32.278 --> 01:49:36.983]  So these are natural ingredients that are there things that will assist you to get to sleep.

[01:49:40.706 --> 01:49:43.329]  Again, that's at Infowarslife.com.
[01:49:44.450 --> 01:49:48.855]  Now, while we were there and covering this story of the papal visit,
[01:49:50.083 --> 01:49:54.425]  I came across this mask of the Pope in New York.
[01:49:54.665 --> 01:49:56.486]  I'll hold this here so we don't get any glare on it.
[01:49:56.506 --> 01:49:57.486]  I actually took a picture.
[01:49:57.506 --> 01:50:03.148]  I was in a white shirt and I held it up to my face and I had some real alert trolls that said, that's fake.
[01:50:04.689 --> 01:50:05.589]  That's photoshopped.
[01:50:06.409 --> 01:50:10.251]  Yeah, you know, but the question is, I thought that was pretty obvious that it was fake.
[01:50:10.291 --> 01:50:10.891]  It was a joke.
[01:50:11.011 --> 01:50:14.353]  But the question is, can they see through the real facade?
[01:50:14.993 --> 01:50:17.514]  Do they really understand why the Pope was here?
[01:50:18.407 --> 01:50:23.449]  And this goes beyond the problems that I had with martial law in Philadelphia and elsewhere.
[01:50:24.130 --> 01:50:25.730]  It goes to the agenda that's being sold.
[01:50:25.770 --> 01:50:30.112]  And understand that the Pope is being used as a moral facade.
[01:50:30.733 --> 01:50:34.654]  And you know, behind this mask of the Pope, there are other masks that are there.
[01:50:34.714 --> 01:50:41.577]  He's in front, he's putting a moral face on the issue of climate change and sustainability, quote-unquote.
[01:50:42.438 --> 01:50:44.839]  And that in and of itself is another mask
[01:50:45.933 --> 01:50:48.573]  That is in front of global governance.
[01:50:49.594 --> 01:50:50.054]  You understand?
[01:50:50.074 --> 01:50:51.414]  There's multiple layers to this.
[01:50:51.494 --> 01:50:52.154]  It's like an onion.
[01:50:53.154 --> 01:50:57.995]  They weren't able to sell climate change as a facade for global government.
[01:50:58.015 --> 01:51:00.876]  They haven't been able to do that on a scientific and political basis.
[01:51:00.976 --> 01:51:01.896]  People see through the fraud.
[01:51:01.936 --> 01:51:12.818]  Even people who believe that there's man-made global warming see through the fraud of cap-and-trade, of carbon taxes, the indulgences that we're supposed to pay that are going to save the planet.
[01:51:12.958 --> 01:51:14.078]  Even if you believe
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:19.244]  That we have man-made global warming that is caused by CO2.
[01:51:19.824 --> 01:51:21.166]  And again, we've talked about that before.
[01:51:21.186 --> 01:51:22.267]  I'm not even going to cover that now.
[01:51:22.387 --> 01:51:29.313]  Even if you see that, you understand that what's being proposed is cap-and-trade, really is cap-and-tax.
[01:51:30.214 --> 01:51:31.856]  You have to understand that's not going to solve the problem.
[01:51:31.876 --> 01:51:35.999]  And you have to understand that the Pope came here to put a moral face on that.
[01:51:37.641 --> 01:51:38.301]  And I have to say,
[01:51:39.315 --> 01:52:01.071]  If he's going to try to put a moral face on it when he has rejected the traditional concerns of the Catholic Church in terms of traditional marriage, in terms of abortion, his silence on that, his tolerance of all of those things, and his tolerance of abuse within the church.
[01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:16.338]  When he became Pope, two and a half years ago, he said that, he told the largest Italian newspaper in terms of circulation, La Repubblica, he said that, in his estimate, there were 2% of the priests were child abusers.
[01:52:16.498 --> 01:52:17.880]  That would be about 8,000 priests.
[01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:20.323]  Has he done anything to get rid of these priests?
[01:52:21.104 --> 01:52:21.284]  No.
[01:52:21.885 --> 01:52:22.545]  Not a single one.
[01:52:23.166 --> 01:52:27.449]  And you have to understand that when someone is a pedophile, they don't just do it once and stop.
[01:52:28.170 --> 01:52:29.070]  It continues on.
[01:52:29.211 --> 01:52:35.656]  I want you to hear the story of one of the ladies that we talked to that is actively involved now in an organization called SNAP.
[01:52:35.896 --> 01:52:39.198]  Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.
[01:52:39.499 --> 01:52:47.685]  This is her story about sexual abuse and I want you to see this and understand how the corruption has been institutionalized.
[01:52:47.705 --> 01:52:48.546]  Here's what she had to say.
[01:52:49.737 --> 01:52:59.040]  Because I was abused as a child from the ages of 9 to 11 by a priest in Alexandria, Virginia, who was a newly ordained priest.
[01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:01.941]  He came to our house and he kind of adopted our family.
[01:53:02.461 --> 01:53:03.601]  He ate dinner with us.
[01:53:03.681 --> 01:53:05.242]  He went on vacation with us.
[01:53:06.542 --> 01:53:08.223]  He became like a member of the family.
[01:53:08.503 --> 01:53:09.143]  And I loved him.
[01:53:09.543 --> 01:53:10.283]  And I adored him.
[01:53:10.603 --> 01:53:12.844]  And he used that to start abusing me.
[01:53:13.721 --> 01:53:20.784]  And I didn't tell anyone until the age of 48 because he told me I'd go to hell and also because I was raised Catholic.
[01:53:21.524 --> 01:53:25.905]  And the nuns had told me that he was sent by God.
[01:53:26.486 --> 01:53:30.467]  And so I thought he was sent by God to punish me and that I was a bad person.
[01:53:30.827 --> 01:53:33.068]  And so I decided to go to the church.
[01:53:33.808 --> 01:53:35.809]  And I thought, they're going to help me.
[01:53:35.869 --> 01:53:37.409]  They're going to be compassionate.
[01:53:37.449 --> 01:53:38.650]  They're going to make me feel better.
[01:53:39.230 --> 01:53:44.797]  And so I went to the church, and the first priest I spoke to, I cried for over an hour, telling him my story.
[01:53:44.837 --> 01:53:52.667]  And I told him that I felt like I was going to hell, and that I didn't think God loved me anymore, and that this was my fault, and I was a bad person.
[01:53:53.208 --> 01:53:56.672]  And at the end of that meeting, I didn't get any reassurances from him.
[01:53:57.313 --> 01:54:01.999]  And I felt so abandoned that I pulled away from the church, and I also pulled away from God.
[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:04.662]  And at that point, I didn't know what to do.
[01:54:04.962 --> 01:54:09.748]  Grooming is what a predator often does, not only with a child, but with a family.
[01:54:09.768 --> 01:54:10.349]  Let's cut that short.
[01:54:10.389 --> 01:54:14.513]  Now, they were both saying they were pictures of themselves at the time that they were abused.
[01:54:15.234 --> 01:54:17.175]  And I want to cut that definition.
[01:54:17.215 --> 01:54:18.996]  That's very important that you understand what grooming is.
[01:54:19.036 --> 01:54:24.018]  But I want you to hear what they had to say about changing the statute of limitations.
[01:54:24.039 --> 01:54:28.040]  Because that's one of the things that they were most concerned about is there's a very short statute of limitations.
[01:54:28.461 --> 01:54:34.444]  Most people who are abused as children don't come out about that until they're in their mid to late 40s.
[01:54:35.024 --> 01:54:36.465]  And there was a hearing in Virginia
[01:54:37.325 --> 01:54:44.574]  And the only person to show up and speak against changing the statute of limitations was the Catholic Archbishop.
[01:54:44.654 --> 01:54:45.835]  Here's what they had to say about that.
[01:54:46.236 --> 01:54:56.948]  Bishop Fenn, who was convicted of endangering children in Kansas City, and he couldn't even teach CCD in his own diocese.
[01:54:57.509 --> 01:54:59.910]  But yet, for two years, he remained the bishop.
[01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:02.330]  And when he did resign, it was quietly.
[01:55:02.871 --> 01:55:06.272]  No one said he resigned because he endangered children.
[01:55:06.552 --> 01:55:11.913]  He got to keep his title, his honors, so that doesn't act as a deterrent to any other bishop.
[01:55:11.993 --> 01:55:12.854]  You know, you abuse?
[01:55:13.194 --> 01:55:13.754]  It's okay.
[01:55:13.794 --> 01:55:16.675]  You can go ahead and keep your honors, and so forth.
[01:55:17.195 --> 01:55:19.756]  And, you know, what kind of answer is that for protecting children?
[01:55:20.036 --> 01:55:27.098]  The archbishop during the last grand jury investigation, and there have been two here in Philadelphia, Justin Regali.
[01:55:27.518 --> 01:55:34.462]  When the grand jury report was handed down, I believe there were 37 predators still in ministry.
[01:55:35.263 --> 01:55:45.609]  And through the grand jury and the trials of Monsignor Lynn, who was convicted of knowingly moving child predators and endangering children, and he is in prison for that part he played.
[01:55:46.329 --> 01:55:47.470]  But Cardinal Bregali,
[01:55:48.616 --> 01:55:49.597]  Quietly resigned.
[01:55:49.737 --> 01:55:52.318]  He's living a life completely.
[01:55:52.358 --> 01:55:53.339]  He hasn't lost his title.
[01:55:53.359 --> 01:55:54.580]  Hasn't lost his paycheck.
[01:55:55.180 --> 01:56:00.143]  And this weekend, we've noticed him in the front pew here at all the festivities.
[01:56:00.403 --> 01:56:01.423]  He's being honored.
[01:56:02.044 --> 01:56:03.765]  And yet he left in disgrace.
[01:56:04.445 --> 01:56:12.770]  So to us, the message is, if you protect the predators, if you keep the church's secret, if you keep the lid on the scandal, you'll be rewarded.
[01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:14.272]  Not, you'll be held accountable.
[01:56:14.753 --> 01:56:25.949]  So how do you take the Pope's words of children are important, the families are everything, and then square that with, well, if you protect the predators who are raping the kids, it's okay.
[01:56:26.189 --> 01:56:29.194]  I think the number is less than 2% of pedophiles are convicted.
[01:56:30.126 --> 01:56:32.467]  And it's because of the statute of limitations.
[01:56:33.267 --> 01:56:40.049]  And the government's research says anyone who's sexually abused as a child doesn't come forward until they're in their mid to late 40s.
[01:56:40.729 --> 01:56:49.752]  So for most, in most states, then they are beyond the statute of limitations and the predator is free to go on and abuse again.
[01:56:49.812 --> 01:56:57.794]  The Department of Justice needs to put in incentives out there for states to change the statute of limitations, or better yet, abolish it.
[01:56:58.534 --> 01:57:20.640]  So that you know you can't hide behind the statute of limitations and the church is certainly hid behind the statute of limitations When reforms have come up and right now there's a bill before the New York legislature Pennsylvania and Washington DC all the places the Pope has been and the only opposition they're facing is the Catholic Church so the Pope could say
[01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:27.403]  Bishops, you may not oppose these law reforms that will make it easier for victims to come forward.
[01:57:27.523 --> 01:57:29.845]  And not only that, you should be fighting... Let's cut it right there.
[01:57:29.905 --> 01:57:34.647]  You have to understand, the only opposition they had to speak against this was a Catholic Archbishop.
[01:57:34.727 --> 01:57:37.168]  And what he said to them was, this will affect my priests.
[01:57:37.769 --> 01:57:43.672]  Understand the cynicism of a Pope who comes here to make a moral case for climate change.
[01:57:44.472 --> 01:57:52.020]  And yet, he goes to the very site where there's been the worst abuse in Philadelphia, and he has a world meeting of families.
[01:57:52.420 --> 01:57:53.461]  That's the cynicism.
[01:57:53.701 --> 01:57:55.443]  That's the facade you need to see through.
[01:57:56.023 --> 01:57:56.744]  That's it for today.
[01:57:56.824 --> 01:57:58.446]  Join us tomorrow for InfoWars.com.
