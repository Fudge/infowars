[00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.872]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.912 --> 00:00:25.956]  It is Friday, October 23rd, 2015 and I'm Leigh-Anne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:27.278]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:33.427 --> 00:00:34.247]  While the U.S.
[00:00:34.307 --> 00:00:37.868]  gives bailouts, Iceland puts dirty bankers in prison.
[00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.730]  Then, a former Planned Parenthood employee talks about the Texas clinic raids.
[00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:45.911]  And who watches the Watchmen?
[00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:47.932]  Well, Alex Jones, of course.
[00:00:48.512 --> 00:00:49.112]  That's next.
[00:00:49.432 --> 00:00:49.972]  Alright, how you doing?
[00:00:50.032 --> 00:00:50.533]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:51.073 --> 00:00:53.534]  InfoWars.com, in here visiting our buddies at Google.
[00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.014]  What are you guys about to do here tonight?
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.721]  Well, I bet Google told me in an update that it uses the camera and microphone to listen to me in my house.
[00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:03.901]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[00:01:03.941 --> 00:01:04.261]  Thank you.
[00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:06.522]  Well, thanks for putting up with me.
[00:01:06.542 --> 00:01:07.342]  Thank you.
[00:01:07.362 --> 00:01:07.922]  Appreciate it.
[00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:08.982]  A couple of listeners.
[00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:10.382]  All right, anyways.
[00:01:11.623 --> 00:01:12.883]  Listen, we care about humans.
[00:01:12.923 --> 00:01:13.723]  We are the resistance.
[00:01:14.383 --> 00:01:17.284]  Just remember, when robots take all your family's jobs in a few years, we're here.
[00:01:17.324 --> 00:01:18.044]  We're here for the people.
[00:01:18.524 --> 00:01:19.244]  We're here for the humans.
[00:01:19.264 --> 00:01:20.644]  All right, we're standing up as hard as we can.
[00:01:21.304 --> 00:01:22.265]  Later, it's going to get bad.
[00:01:22.605 --> 00:01:23.425]  You'll break the conditioning then.
[00:01:23.525 --> 00:01:23.685]  Okay.
[00:01:33.903 --> 00:01:43.288]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:01:43.628 --> 00:01:46.249]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.671]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:55.914]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:58.736]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[00:01:58.936 --> 00:02:01.058]  And then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[00:02:01.338 --> 00:02:07.523]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[00:02:07.723 --> 00:02:15.209]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:22.735]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[00:02:26.618 --> 00:02:28.319]  That's ChildEase exclusively.

[00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:39.023]  Well, they say if you jail the bankers, this whole New World Order scheme would come down like a house of cards.
[00:02:39.563 --> 00:02:40.604]  But while the U.S.
[00:02:40.664 --> 00:02:44.466]  and Europe were bailing out the crooks, Iceland did just that.
[00:02:44.827 --> 00:02:52.852]  In fact, Iceland has now sentenced another five high-level bankers to prison for directly contributing to the collapse of their country's economy in 2008.
[00:02:53.392 --> 00:02:58.696]  This brings the total to 26 corrupt bankers that Iceland has sent to prison.
[00:02:59.116 --> 00:03:04.879]  Most of them being CEOs of large financial institutions rather than low-level traders.
[00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:17.824]  Now, most of those jailed will serve two to five years, and their crimes include market manipulation, embezzlement, and breach of fiduciary duties, all of which help to destroy their country's economy.
[00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:27.328]  Now, of course, these prosecutions have been possible because rather than protect the very institutions responsible for the collapse, they took them to task.
[00:03:27.408 --> 00:03:28.349]  They let them fail.
[00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:33.692]  And then they created a financial supervisory authority to strictly oversee the banks.
[00:03:34.432 --> 00:03:35.953]  But that's not here what we do in America.
[00:03:36.093 --> 00:03:38.334]  In America, they're just too big to jail.
[00:03:38.994 --> 00:03:40.415]  Iceland is the answer for the world.
[00:03:41.015 --> 00:03:44.597]  They were told they owed something like 85, 90 billion dollars.
[00:03:44.617 --> 00:03:55.383]  If you go back to the time six years ago, during the banker bailout at the end of 2008 globally, they just arrested their finance ministers, got all the documents, and found that they owed about four billion dollars or less.
[00:03:56.395 --> 00:04:00.658]  In fact, some estimates were less than a billion, but the point is they debated a billion, four billion was the max.
[00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:03.500]  Some estimates were as low as 800 million.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.921]  The point is 800 million to four billion.
[00:04:05.401 --> 00:04:12.586]  They've paid back several billion of it now with interest, and they've now arrested 26 corrupt bankers that were involved in the scam.
[00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:19.850]  It turns out the head finance minister had signed the government on to big British, Swiss, and U.S.
[00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.591]  banks debt that wasn't theirs.
[00:04:21.631 --> 00:04:22.352]  And why is that important?
[00:04:22.872 --> 00:04:23.973]  It's the exact same model.
[00:04:24.534 --> 00:04:35.263]  Here in the United States, in Greece, in Spain, in Portugal, in Italy, where the number is normally above 90% of the debt that we're signed on to is not ours.
[00:04:36.063 --> 00:04:38.445]  Just like we have 19 trillion of debt that's U.S.
[00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:43.649]  debt, but even signed on to way more other international obligations and things that aren't our debts.
[00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.334]  And then the bankers that basically honcho all this, they're able to get full control over society.
[00:04:49.374 --> 00:04:52.977]  So there is that extremely important article up on InfoWars.com.
[00:04:53.365 --> 00:05:01.089]  In the U.S., Congress gave American banks a $700 billion TARP bailout at the expense of taxpayers.
[00:05:01.489 --> 00:05:02.710]  Not one banker in the U.S.
[00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.252]  has even been charged with a crime relating to the financial collapse.
[00:05:06.292 --> 00:05:09.013]  There's still virtually no regulation of the banks.
[00:05:09.373 --> 00:05:19.158]  And in fact, they're now raking in record profits, $160 billion annually, all from money that they create out of thin air.
[00:05:19.438 --> 00:05:22.880]  So this is a common theme in our present-day government.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.681]  Protecting the crooks.
[00:05:25.401 --> 00:05:29.983]  And just like that, there's also going to be no charges filed for Lois Lerner.
[00:05:30.003 --> 00:05:32.584]  Now, this is former IRS official Lois Lerner.
[00:05:32.604 --> 00:05:35.725]  They're not going to charge her or anyone else at the agency.
[00:05:35.785 --> 00:05:38.106]  They're just, DOJ announced they're dropping the case.
[00:05:38.587 --> 00:05:47.430]  Now, let's not forget, Lois Lerner did the kind of things that Nixon was impeached for, using the IRS to go against political foes.
[00:05:47.751 --> 00:05:50.252]  So she's going to face no charges and
[00:05:51.432 --> 00:06:00.959]  For targeting conservatives, and probably because if we actually could find those servers, we'd find that those directives came from the very top of the Obama administration.
[00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:16.349]  Now, they do say that the probe found substantial evidence of mismanagement, poor judgment, and institutional inertia, leading to the belief by many tax-exempt applicants that the IRS targeted them based on their political viewpoints.
[00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:19.092]  But poor management is not a crime.
[00:06:30.595 --> 00:06:35.498]  Basically, they're saying our entire government would be in prison if mismanagement was a crime.
[00:06:35.578 --> 00:06:39.061]  The whole government is guilty of institutional inertia.
[00:06:39.541 --> 00:06:49.548]  And now this mismanagement, of course, is the exact same excuse used when they were investigating what happened to that missing $6 billion from Hillary Clinton's State Department.
[00:06:49.848 --> 00:06:51.529]  It was also just, you know, they said that
[00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:53.990]  They were just really bad at doing their paperwork.
[00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.791]  Oh well, forget about that money.
[00:06:56.251 --> 00:06:57.871]  And of course, that's who we need as president.
[00:06:57.911 --> 00:07:00.492]  Someone who loses six billion dollars.
[00:07:01.033 --> 00:07:07.195]  Now, speaking of getting away with criminal negligence, Hillary testified in front of the Benghazi committee yesterday.
[00:07:07.215 --> 00:07:13.218]  And if you've seen the videos, she laughed about going home to bed the night of the attacks.
[00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:18.640]  She all but blamed Ambassador Stevens for his own death, saying that he was in charge of his own safety.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.922]  And she also said that she did not blame it on any video.
[00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:30.144]  So when it comes to Hillary's performance at the Benghazi Committee hearing, a picture is worth a thousand words.
[00:07:30.464 --> 00:07:35.826]  Take a look at how the New York Times covered it versus, say, another publication like the Wall Street Journal.
[00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:38.207]  They've got a picture of her there and they say,
[00:07:38.887 --> 00:07:43.171]  Basically, that Hillary, here she's smug and she let others do the yelling this time.
[00:07:43.531 --> 00:07:47.334]  Well, the Wall Street Journal showed some other pictures of what was really going on that day.
[00:07:47.354 --> 00:07:53.719]  Um, her just looking so smug, laughing, they omitted her two minute coughing fit.
[00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:59.844]  But that's, that's all you really need to know about what the media is going to try and spin the Benghazi hearing.
[00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:06.269]  But here's all you need to know about Hillary's testimony from a mother of one of the victims in the Benghazi attack.
[00:08:06.989 --> 00:08:10.730]  With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans.
[00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:15.992]  Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans?
[00:08:16.572 --> 00:08:19.113]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:08:19.453 --> 00:08:25.876]  It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.
[00:08:27.476 --> 00:08:29.657]  When you heard that, what went through your mind?
[00:08:30.998 --> 00:08:31.838]  She's lying!
[00:08:33.174 --> 00:08:35.497]  She's absolutely lying!
[00:08:36.058 --> 00:08:44.529]  So is it finally time to see a revolution in this country or will people like Hillary and her crooked cronies remain too big to jail?
[00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.713]  Now, we're certainly seeing the elite start to scramble.
[00:08:48.114 --> 00:08:52.137]  We've reported many times before record profits there in the home security business.
[00:08:52.517 --> 00:08:56.120]  Paranoid super-rich becoming obsessed with home security.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:09.990]  Watson's got an article up on InfoWars talking about how billionaires are splashing out on high-tech panic rooms, blast-proof windows, hidden spy cameras, all sorts of things to protect themselves, protect their riches, of course.
[00:09:10.811 --> 00:09:15.294]  Should they really be worried about soaring crime rates, or is it something else?
[00:09:15.374 --> 00:09:18.596]  Are they beginning to realize that it finally might be time to pay the piper?
[00:09:24.023 --> 00:09:25.704]  74 combined years in prison.
[00:09:26.204 --> 00:09:34.470]  That's how Iceland's Supreme Court and the Reykjavik District Court respond to those responsible for Iceland's financial collapse.
[00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:45.578]  This brings the total to 26 bankers now behind bars in Iceland, with most being CEOs of large financial institutions rather than low-level traders.
[00:09:46.098 --> 00:09:52.103]  Most of those jailed will serve terms of two to five years, according to a report by Iceland magazine.
[00:09:52.503 --> 00:10:00.986]  Which notes that three executives at Lands Banken and two at Cowpea along with one prominent investor have been prosecuted.
[00:10:01.386 --> 00:10:06.128]  Their crimes include market manipulation, embezzlement and breach of fiduciary duties.
[00:10:06.288 --> 00:10:18.093]  Their market manipulation destroyed the country's economy and to this day Iceland is still having to repay the global loan sharks at the IMF as well as governments of other countries which kept the nation operating.
[00:10:18.593 --> 00:10:35.240]  Iceland Magazine explains that rather than protect and reward the very institutions responsible for the collapse, and the blood-sucking vermin that run them, the Icelandic government let them collapse, and then created a financial supervisory authority to strictly oversee the banks.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:41.682]  Iceland's President Grimson noted, Why are the banks considered to be the holy churches of the modern economy?
[00:10:41.962 --> 00:10:45.924]  Why are private banks not like airlines and telecommunication companies?
[00:10:46.224 --> 00:10:46.905]  We're good to go.
[00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:09.262]  Iceland's President Grimson explained their strategy.
[00:11:09.702 --> 00:11:16.223]  We were wise enough not to follow the traditional prevailing orthodoxies of the Western financial world in the last 30 years.
[00:11:16.483 --> 00:11:25.545]  We introduced currency controls, we let the banks fail, we provided support for the poor, and we didn't introduce austerity measures like you're seeing in Europe.
[00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:28.426]  While the country's economy is far from what it once was,
[00:11:28.946 --> 00:11:31.768]  It has stabilized and is in a position to recover.
[00:11:31.948 --> 00:11:40.615]  Meanwhile, the governments of the US and Europe bailed out most of those responsible for playing a direct role in the financial crisis that crippled the global economy.
[00:11:56.587 --> 00:11:57.027]  The U.S.
[00:11:57.087 --> 00:12:03.870]  Congress gave American banks a $700 billion TARP bailout at the expense of the taxpayers.
[00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:05.511]  Not one banker in the U.S.
[00:12:05.551 --> 00:12:08.853]  has even been charged with a crime relating to the financial collapse.
[00:12:09.093 --> 00:12:15.056]  There is still virtually no regulation of the banks, and they are pulling in a near-record $160 billion in annual profits.
[00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:20.278]  All for money created out of thin air.
[00:12:20.539 --> 00:12:30.984]  The Department of Justice, Underholder, and now Lynch continues to pretend to do the hard work associated with reining in the financial criminal banking institutions laundering drug cartel money.
[00:12:31.305 --> 00:12:36.147]  But fines and even penalties don't send the message that the banksters received in Iceland.
[00:12:36.688 --> 00:12:40.790]  Jail the bankers, the ones at the top, and free the taxpayers.
[00:12:42.628 --> 00:12:47.049]  It may be the most important meme the people of the United States could ever support.
[00:12:47.469 --> 00:12:52.431]  Jailing the bankers would bring the New World Order down like a house of cards.
[00:12:52.531 --> 00:12:55.492]  We have a large house blend, please.
[00:12:55.852 --> 00:12:57.012]  Alright, let me get that for you.
[00:12:57.392 --> 00:12:59.433]  Oh yeah, he's definitely one.
[00:13:01.693 --> 00:13:02.374]  I gotta ask you this.
[00:13:02.494 --> 00:13:03.855]  It's just a matter of national security.
[00:13:04.256 --> 00:13:05.317]  I'm an important person now.
[00:13:06.178 --> 00:13:07.499]  Is there a reason you're paying with cash?
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.902]  I don't understand how that's any of your business.
[00:13:10.442 --> 00:13:12.664]  I have a couple of 20s here, so I'm just gonna give you a 20.
[00:13:12.764 --> 00:13:14.066]  Is that cool?
[00:13:14.506 --> 00:13:16.688]  Oh my God, there are everywhere!
[00:13:17.229 --> 00:13:19.071]  Oh, thank you everybody!
[00:13:19.612 --> 00:13:20.152]  Oh, hold on.
[00:13:20.172 --> 00:13:21.533]  I gotta get my stuff together.
[00:13:21.614 --> 00:13:24.296]  I'm checking... John Ballard for InfoWars.com
[00:13:27.435 --> 00:13:34.018]  Coming up later in the show, I'm going to be speaking with former Planned Parenthood director turned whistleblower, Abby Johnson.
[00:13:34.058 --> 00:13:39.621]  She's going to be joining me to discuss the Texas raids yesterday on Planned Parenthood clinics.
[00:13:39.981 --> 00:13:44.403]  But first, today the House of Representatives has moved to defund Planned Parenthood.
[00:13:44.663 --> 00:13:52.447]  They've approved a bill that will use the reconciliation process to approve legislation to defund the Planned Parenthood abortion business.
[00:13:53.127 --> 00:14:03.570]  The bill is going to prohibit all federal mandatory funding for one year to abortion providers while the House continues its investigation into Planned Parenthood's activities.
[00:14:04.131 --> 00:14:13.554]  Now, of course, Planned Parenthood has recently announced that it's going to stop selling aborted baby parts, although it will still harvest and donate them to science.
[00:14:14.174 --> 00:14:16.915]  Ah, but I thought nothing illegal was going down?
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.602]  We're going to talk about what's going on with the Planned Parenthood investigation.
[00:14:22.102 --> 00:14:26.204]  We have Abby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood employee.
[00:14:26.584 --> 00:14:29.946]  Actually, she was a manager at one of the Planned Parenthoods, became a whistleblower.
[00:14:30.707 --> 00:14:32.728]  She's going to be with us in the fourth hour.
[00:14:33.348 --> 00:14:53.714]  And there's an interesting revelation that came out today in the House committee that is investigating the Planned Parenthood videos that were done by the undercover investigation, that was done by the Center for Medical Progress, and of course the line of defense that Planned Parenthood came back with was, these are deceptively edited videos.
[00:14:54.594 --> 00:14:57.295]  So the House was investigating what appeared to be
[00:14:58.115 --> 00:15:04.580]  Very clearly, if you watch the videos, certainly they were skirting the law in terms of partial birth abortion.
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:14.506]  They were skirting the law in terms of soliciting body parts and procuring body parts for Stem Cell Express and other companies like that.
[00:15:15.287 --> 00:15:19.070]  So that appeared to be what was in the videos, but they said, no, no, no, they've deceptively edited it.
[00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:23.473]  So the House Committee that is investigating this said, well, give us the raw footage.
[00:15:24.639 --> 00:15:32.705]  So they gave the raw footage to the House, and then an abortion group said, oh wait a minute, you don't release that raw footage.
[00:15:33.205 --> 00:15:35.627]  Why would they not want to release the raw footage?
[00:15:35.667 --> 00:15:37.409]  I thought it was deceptively edited.
[00:15:37.789 --> 00:15:39.050]  I thought it was just a hoax.
[00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:46.655]  The raw footage should exonerate Planned Parenthood if that was true, but they were very adamant not to let that go out.
[00:15:47.076 --> 00:15:48.277]  Now we learn from Politico,
[00:15:48.877 --> 00:16:01.685]  That complete raw footage from the Planned Parenthood video surfaced Thursday on a conservative website, Got News, whose editor said he'd gotten it from a House staffer despite lawmakers' pledge to keep it confidential.
[00:16:02.245 --> 00:16:11.971]  Editor Charles Johnson released the full footage on Thursday after the National Abortion Federation got a temporary restraining order a day earlier prohibiting any dissemination.
[00:16:12.631 --> 00:16:18.226]  Johnson said he would, quote, contest any unconstitutional prior restraint of speech.
[00:16:18.848 --> 00:16:19.489]  Good for him.
[00:16:20.845 --> 00:16:33.473]  Well, in a time of creeping surveillance everywhere, you might have heard by now that Google absolutely freaked out when Alex Jones stormed their Austin headquarters, turning the cameras around on them.
[00:16:33.853 --> 00:16:44.720]  Now, we played a shorter version of that report today on the Alex Jones Radio Show, and we are going to have a longer, extended version with all the goodies coming up right after this short break.
[00:16:54.946 --> 00:17:05.729]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[00:17:06.049 --> 00:17:08.270]  It's time to stop submitting to this tyranny!
[00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.551]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[00:17:11.171 --> 00:17:13.952]  Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works.
[00:17:15.472 --> 00:17:18.173]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[00:17:18.353 --> 00:17:21.934]  Tyranny with a capital T. You should reject these voices.
[00:17:22.715 --> 00:17:24.035]  Everything that's been done
[00:17:25.233 --> 00:17:41.749]  With torture, mendition, the NDAA, the Patriot Acts 1 and 2, from day one, was focused on the American people, period.
[00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:43.571]  That's it.
[00:17:44.719 --> 00:17:53.247]  It's always been about erasing the Bill of Rights and Constitution and rolling out NSA spying publicly, saying it's for Al-Qaeda.
[00:17:53.667 --> 00:17:57.751]  Rolling out torture, saying it's for Al-Qaeda, but it's really for the general public.
[00:17:58.111 --> 00:18:06.699]  Rolling out total control and the end of any underground free market systems in the name of fighting Al-Qaeda, but really shutting down any type of free commerce.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.122]  This is all about converting us
[00:18:09.662 --> 00:18:21.789]  From a free society to a tyranny with a capital T. Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:18:22.089 --> 00:18:36.498]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:18:36.778 --> 00:18:44.624]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:18:44.784 --> 00:18:50.249]  And when you visit Infowarslife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a 6-day liver detox.
[00:18:50.349 --> 00:18:53.751]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:18:53.911 --> 00:18:57.935]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:18:58.035 --> 00:19:01.958]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:19:02.458 --> 00:19:02.918]  We're good to go.
[00:19:28.683 --> 00:19:31.846]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:19:32.126 --> 00:19:32.266]  Right?
[00:19:32.286 --> 00:19:34.648]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:19:35.009 --> 00:19:38.532]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:19:38.572 --> 00:19:41.735]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:19:42.235 --> 00:19:47.019]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.422]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:19:49.782 --> 00:19:54.186]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:19:54.386 --> 00:19:56.448]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.530]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:19:58.650 --> 00:19:58.810]  Exactly.
[00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:02.714]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:20:03.235 --> 00:20:11.282]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:20:19.294 --> 00:20:28.704]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:20:29.024 --> 00:20:31.586]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:35.070]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:41.296]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[00:20:41.596 --> 00:20:46.440]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:52.905]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[00:20:53.125 --> 00:21:00.571]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[00:21:00.851 --> 00:21:08.116]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[00:21:08.396 --> 00:21:11.878]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:11.999 --> 00:21:15.561]  That's ChildEase exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:18.103]  Knockout is back if you want
[00:21:18.783 --> 00:21:27.527]  A product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep restful sleep.
[00:21:27.687 --> 00:21:28.428]  Knockouts it.
[00:21:28.828 --> 00:21:30.529]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:40.153]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:21:40.553 --> 00:21:42.334]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:21:42.894 --> 00:21:43.775]  It's the same price.
[00:21:44.495 --> 00:21:50.378]  As leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece, it has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult.
[00:21:50.918 --> 00:21:57.162]  It's got the GABA, so it would probably cost $50 to take all this as separate pills.
[00:21:57.662 --> 00:21:57.802]  It's $19.95.
[00:21:58.522 --> 00:22:00.844]  You take one or two of these,
[00:22:01.944 --> 00:22:05.227]  And it just is really clean, restful sleep is what the reviews are.
[00:22:05.568 --> 00:22:06.649]  It's what I've experienced.
[00:22:07.089 --> 00:22:09.452]  And it just synergistically puts everything in there.
[00:22:09.472 --> 00:22:11.033]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:22:11.193 --> 00:22:13.135]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:22:19.517 --> 00:22:23.540]  Well here's the latest proposal from the totalitarian PC crowd.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:31.925]  Now Silicon Valley experts are saying that they want to use pop-ups to shame people who make offensive posts on the internet.
[00:22:32.345 --> 00:22:34.507]  Now this is tech expert Adria Richards.
[00:22:34.767 --> 00:22:45.494]  She was interviewed for a Wired magazine piece about online harassment and she suggested that pop-ups could be used to shame people who make racist internet posts or use offensive words.
[00:22:45.894 --> 00:22:47.175]  There could be little pop-up warnings.
[00:22:47.455 --> 00:22:50.737]  Hey, a lot of people have reported they don't like receiving this word.
[00:22:51.037 --> 00:22:52.739]  Do you still want to post this?
[00:22:53.319 --> 00:22:56.561]  Oh, that'll be just as annoying as all those pop-up ads that we have everywhere.
[00:22:56.921 --> 00:23:03.826]  Now, surprisingly, the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Nadia Khayali agreed with this.
[00:23:03.926 --> 00:23:06.327]  She remarked, yeah, can we shame people with pop-ups?
[00:23:06.628 --> 00:23:08.809]  Because shame seems to work a lot better.
[00:23:09.089 --> 00:23:11.231]  Hey, did you know you're being racist right now?
[00:23:12.091 --> 00:23:18.172]  So it's sort of like the MTV crowd is just going to be everywhere now policing all of your posts on the internet.
[00:23:18.592 --> 00:23:27.694]  Now let's not forget that feminists just last month went before a United Nations panel on cyber violence to push for this very same thing.
[00:23:27.974 --> 00:23:34.216]  They wanted to censor anyone who calls them stupid or disagrees with anything that they have to say on the internet.
[00:23:35.276 --> 00:23:36.637]  This is very totalitarian.
[00:23:36.977 --> 00:23:55.110]  The Washington Post labeled the UN plan a radical, dangerous vision for the future of the web and warned that it could force social networks to proactively police every profile and post and mandate that government agencies only license those who agree to do so.
[00:23:55.491 --> 00:23:57.732]  Oh my goodness, and we've talked about that before.
[00:23:58.152 --> 00:24:01.455]  Your permission to use the internet just like they do in China.
[00:24:01.475 --> 00:24:04.017]  Of course, the only plus I could see to that is that
[00:24:04.757 --> 00:24:11.363]  I would get a trigger warning if someone wants to post a picture saying, check your privilege, or, oh hey, look, I'm running a race and free bleeding!
[00:24:12.144 --> 00:24:16.968]  Everything we type into the internet helps the artificial intelligence learn.
[00:24:17.288 --> 00:24:18.970]  Who cares about the consequences?
[00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:21.152]  It's just like with autonomous vehicles.
[00:24:21.192 --> 00:24:27.598]  There might be a few casualties along the way, but the ultimate goals of the empire will be accomplished.
[00:24:27.978 --> 00:24:31.579]  Just take a look at this autonomous Tesla being driven.
[00:24:32.259 --> 00:24:37.280]  The car is malfunctioning, the guy is driving it along, and it's going happily, and then... Oh!
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:38.920]  Exactly.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:44.061]  It's one thing to have your software crash on you, but the vehicle that you are riding in?
[00:24:44.501 --> 00:24:45.101]  Absolutely not.
[00:24:45.141 --> 00:24:47.802]  So who's looking out for little brother?
[00:24:48.122 --> 00:24:49.742]  Who's watching the watchers?
[00:24:50.162 --> 00:24:55.883]  Now, it's okay for Google to watch our every move, but heavens forbid we start watching them.
[00:24:56.243 --> 00:25:00.324]  Now, Google freaked out when Alex Jones stormed their Austin headquarters.
[00:25:00.764 --> 00:25:08.247]  Google, of course, is notorious for spying on internet users, but when Alex attempted to film inside, he was immediately asked to leave.
[00:25:08.607 --> 00:25:11.868]  Jones and the crew were told that the company didn't allow video recording.
[00:25:12.188 --> 00:25:18.970]  And this is despite the fact that a huge sign on the wall made it very clear that Google was recording everyone who was inside the vicinity.
[00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:30.095]  But when Jones, of course, pointed out that Google had secretly installed software on computers that can listen to people's conversations without them knowing, that's when the Google reps got a little nervous.
[00:25:31.836 --> 00:25:34.737]  Google has announced they're watching and listening to you over your microphones and camera.
[00:25:35.178 --> 00:25:42.041]  Is it the politically correct thing to do to submit to the viewing, but say it's not happening because in a free country they're not watching you, even though they admit they are?
[00:25:42.081 --> 00:25:42.921]  Is that the proper mode?
[00:25:43.822 --> 00:25:44.602]  I don't have a comment.
[00:25:45.002 --> 00:25:45.503]  Not right now.
[00:25:45.823 --> 00:25:47.584]  It's just best to submit to the machine takeover.
[00:25:47.644 --> 00:25:48.224]  I agree with you.
[00:25:58.001 --> 00:26:01.583]  The way some people see it, Big Brother is watching and his name is Google.
[00:26:01.863 --> 00:26:06.726]  Google's wearable computer is also facing stiff resistance, mostly over privacy concerns.
[00:26:06.906 --> 00:26:09.408]  Eric Schmidt is Google's CEO.
[00:26:09.848 --> 00:26:14.271]  If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.
[00:26:14.662 --> 00:26:19.004]  In the not-too-distant future, you'll likely see some of these cruising past you.
[00:26:19.204 --> 00:26:20.885]  There's what I call the creepy line.
[00:26:21.225 --> 00:26:25.708]  I would argue that implanting things in your brain is beyond the creepy line.
[00:26:26.188 --> 00:26:26.828]  Yes, yes.
[00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:30.770]  At least for the moment, until the technology gets better.
[00:26:33.552 --> 00:26:37.874]  Now, a lot of times, people ask me why I do confrontational things.
[00:26:37.894 --> 00:26:38.934]  I don't do as much as I used to.
[00:26:39.515 --> 00:26:41.436]  It's because the globalists are confronting us.
[00:26:42.196 --> 00:26:43.076]  They're getting in our face.
[00:26:43.096 --> 00:26:43.977]  They're doing things to us.
[00:26:45.433 --> 00:26:47.155]  And they're taking our data.
[00:26:47.775 --> 00:26:54.241]  And it's time we just give them a little bit of the aggressiveness they give us to illustrate how what they do is hidden hand.
[00:26:54.922 --> 00:26:56.063]  What they do is digital.
[00:26:56.864 --> 00:27:02.229]  The real power in this world is still, and will get even more powerful in the future, physical.
[00:27:02.929 --> 00:27:10.716]  As less people get physical, as less people deal in third dimension and use their mind for fourth and fifth dimension thinking, what we're doing right now is where it's all at.
[00:27:10.736 --> 00:27:11.057]  Let's go in.
[00:27:16.118 --> 00:27:18.019]  Hello ma'am, Alex Jones, how are you doing?
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.000]  I'm well sir, how are you?
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:19.541]  Good, good.
[00:27:19.561 --> 00:27:20.862]  This looks like an exciting event tonight.
[00:27:20.902 --> 00:27:22.043]  How are you doing, Alex Jones?
[00:27:22.363 --> 00:27:24.805]  InfoWars.com and here visiting our buddies at Google.
[00:27:26.126 --> 00:27:27.307]  What are you guys about to do here tonight?
[00:27:27.647 --> 00:27:29.668]  Actually, we don't allow recording in here.
[00:27:29.969 --> 00:27:34.012]  Well, but Google told me in an update that it uses the camera and microphone to listen to me in my house.
[00:27:35.433 --> 00:27:36.834]  Just one second.
[00:27:36.854 --> 00:27:40.937]  You don't allow recording in here, but you got our camera right there on the computer that Google says it uses to watch people.
[00:27:41.938 --> 00:27:43.059]  I'm a little confused by that.
[00:27:44.445 --> 00:27:47.646]  I mean, we got everybody getting roped in here, and then we're just here with a camera.
[00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:49.387]  I mean, Google's got its cameras on all our computers.
[00:27:49.407 --> 00:27:50.027]  We use Google.
[00:27:50.867 --> 00:27:51.448]  Watching us.
[00:27:54.188 --> 00:27:55.209]  I mean, just explain that to me.
[00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:59.010]  How can he say we shouldn't have a camera in here when Google is all about selling our data?
[00:28:00.691 --> 00:28:03.552]  You just listen to us inside our houses without asking?
[00:28:03.852 --> 00:28:04.792]  And try to take our cars over?
[00:28:05.713 --> 00:28:06.133]  Is that all?
[00:28:06.513 --> 00:28:08.093]  You lobby government to take our cars away?
[00:28:09.094 --> 00:28:10.594]  Anyway, so we're just here with a camera.
[00:28:10.854 --> 00:28:11.855]  Google has phones
[00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:14.830]  You know, dialing in, watching us, listening to us?
[00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:17.831]  I mean, I'm really trying to figure this out.
[00:28:17.991 --> 00:28:19.211]  Let's go look at some of the food over here.
[00:28:20.411 --> 00:28:20.811]  Here we go.
[00:28:22.872 --> 00:28:23.372]  Absolutely.
[00:28:23.692 --> 00:28:24.872]  Oh, we can't videotape in here?
[00:28:26.333 --> 00:28:27.513]  Don't worry, we're already streaming it live.
[00:28:27.553 --> 00:28:28.493]  You won't stop our transmission.
[00:28:29.113 --> 00:28:30.453]  Anyways, we're here inside Google.
[00:28:31.373 --> 00:28:32.134]  Invitation only.
[00:28:32.554 --> 00:28:37.275]  Google doesn't tell you it's invitation only when they hack into your house and watch and track everything you're doing.
[00:28:38.215 --> 00:28:38.895]  Look, we got lots of...
[00:28:41.201 --> 00:28:42.843]  Oh, whoa, whoa, please don't touch our equipment.
[00:28:42.863 --> 00:28:44.645]  I'm not going to touch your Google.
[00:28:44.845 --> 00:28:46.086]  Whoa, ma'am, don't touch me, please.
[00:28:46.266 --> 00:28:47.348]  This is a private event, sir.
[00:28:47.388 --> 00:28:49.770]  Well, ma'am, I don't want to... Well, I need you to not touch me.
[00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:50.771]  Well, I need you to leave, sir.
[00:28:51.052 --> 00:28:52.233]  Okay, but is it a private event?
[00:28:52.253 --> 00:28:53.674]  Is Google watching and listening inside here?
[00:28:53.774 --> 00:28:54.976]  I do not work for Google.
[00:28:55.016 --> 00:28:55.897]  Well, you shouldn't be touching me.
[00:28:55.937 --> 00:28:56.417]  That's assault.
[00:28:56.958 --> 00:28:58.399]  Well, you shouldn't be invading trespass.
[00:28:58.539 --> 00:29:00.642]  Actually, well, I need a police officer to tell me that.
[00:29:00.662 --> 00:29:01.663]  You need to go ahead and have them call.
[00:29:03.962 --> 00:29:04.762]  Yeah, do that, go ahead.
[00:29:05.262 --> 00:29:08.784]  So again, Google trespasses on us, tracks and listens to everything we do.
[00:29:09.585 --> 00:29:11.946]  We come here, and what did I say the response would be?
[00:29:12.307 --> 00:29:22.973]  We're polite, we're nice, and this is how Google ropes in all the local community and gives them a little free cheese and stuff, like you do a mouse before it gets in the trap and slams the door shut.
[00:29:23.873 --> 00:29:30.337]  But just like we've had all the NSA whistleblowers on, we're going to continue to expose the public front of the NSA.
[00:29:30.357 --> 00:29:31.418]  Come on, let's go back outside now.
[00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:39.612]  One of our latest additions to InfoWars, he's going to introduce himself now, just pointed out some key HUMET, or human intelligence, when he was inside.
[00:29:39.632 --> 00:29:41.113]  So we're going to go back in and show everybody.
[00:29:41.993 --> 00:29:42.614]  Michael Zimmerman.
[00:29:43.314 --> 00:29:50.638]  When we were inside just now, I noticed a sign on the window that says, when you're in this building, everything that goes on here is going to be recorded for this event.
[00:29:51.118 --> 00:29:57.141]  So you're on camera no matter where you are in the Google building, and they'll capture you on camera.
[00:29:57.421 --> 00:29:58.061]  But they're mad at us.
[00:29:58.101 --> 00:29:58.781]  Come show us the sign.
[00:29:58.821 --> 00:29:59.182]  Exactly.
[00:29:59.222 --> 00:29:59.882]  Come show us the sign.
[00:30:00.362 --> 00:30:01.082]  Here we go, round two.
[00:30:01.102 --> 00:30:02.063]  They're going to get really upset now.
[00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:07.270]  And just, Mr. Zimmerman, please point this out to us.
[00:30:08.431 --> 00:30:09.371]  Ma'am, we are back.
[00:30:09.451 --> 00:30:10.251]  We appreciate you.
[00:30:10.271 --> 00:30:13.133]  Real quick, I was here to see the sign.
[00:30:13.213 --> 00:30:18.215]  This says that everybody's being filmed in here by Google, just like they film you inside your house.
[00:30:18.755 --> 00:30:21.516]  So what would the issue be with us in here filming?
[00:30:21.556 --> 00:30:22.677]  Nothing against your event, ma'am.
[00:30:22.697 --> 00:30:24.437]  I'm sorry the Google spider has caught you.
[00:30:24.777 --> 00:30:25.758]  But notice to the public,
[00:30:27.674 --> 00:30:30.295]  Film and videotape is presently being shot in this location.
[00:30:30.415 --> 00:30:33.856]  All areas in this event are likely to be filmed for the least part of the event's duration.
[00:30:34.476 --> 00:30:36.357]  Now that's from Google, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:37.237 --> 00:30:38.197]  So that's what goes on.
[00:30:38.297 --> 00:30:39.298]  Thank you, Google Fiber.
[00:30:39.398 --> 00:30:43.479]  See it on Infowars.com and on the Google platform YouTube.
[00:30:44.119 --> 00:30:46.140]  Because we use the enemy's platforms against them.
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:46.920]  Thank you.
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:53.127]  You know, Alex, we've come a long way with our understanding of Google, with our understanding of the tracking technology.
[00:30:53.147 --> 00:31:06.063]  I mean, years ago you talked to someone on the street, they didn't have no idea they were being tracked in their Google searches to the extent they know now in their apps that they're accepting to give away all of their information to essentially the Borg system when they download iPhone apps or Android apps.
[00:31:07.059 --> 00:31:21.106]  I want to ask you where you see all this going with the future of AI cars, driverless cars, because I don't know about you, personally, I'm not against the advancements of technology, which absolutely we're not, and I'm not against the idea, even some day, of AI-based cars.
[00:31:21.666 --> 00:31:36.373]  My problem is the control system of the AI cars, the control system of forcing you into it, the control system of saying that you are a human slug without any ability to do anything for yourself, and these driverless AI systems and
[00:31:36.673 --> 00:31:44.337]  Well, that's it, Anthony.
[00:31:45.198 --> 00:31:46.559]  We didn't ask for this.
[00:31:46.759 --> 00:31:54.603]  It was Trojan Horse, not just with Google, but into all the cars, the other PC systems, the Apple systems, you name it.
[00:31:54.984 --> 00:31:58.766]  They get together in these big giant corporate board meetings with governmental leaders,
[00:31:59.406 --> 00:32:02.088]  This stuff's been declassified over the last 50 years.
[00:32:02.148 --> 00:32:06.992]  This has been happening with DARPA and other agencies, and they decide the future.
[00:32:07.172 --> 00:32:22.265]  We've built this artificiality that has so many positive angles to it, but overall, the screen time, the television watching, lowering our IQ, causing brain damage, this is not debatable.
[00:32:27.116 --> 00:32:28.758]  The knowledge of the ancients.
[00:32:29.078 --> 00:32:32.621]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:32:32.901 --> 00:32:35.504]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:32:35.824 --> 00:32:39.267]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:32:39.467 --> 00:32:43.171]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts.
[00:32:43.251 --> 00:32:43.411]  I'm good.
[00:33:07.523 --> 00:33:10.664]  Well, I mean, the Alexa Pure is really a culmination of all of my experience.
[00:33:10.684 --> 00:33:11.464]  It was posed to me as
[00:33:37.389 --> 00:33:39.390]  An extremely challenging project.
[00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:55.659]  They wanted a product that would actually operate without any electricity, so you had no pressure, you had to do it all by gravity, and they really effectively said, we need everything imaginable to be removed efficiently, way higher than 99%.
[00:33:56.879 --> 00:33:59.941]  And so the result was, it's an extreme challenge.
[00:34:00.601 --> 00:34:05.724]  I worked on it for quite a long time, and basically what we've done is we've created
[00:34:06.317 --> 00:34:09.700]  The only filter, to my knowledge, that hits all three.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:17.626]  It will remove, effectively, all the major metals, all the major non-metals, such as fluoride.
[00:34:18.027 --> 00:34:23.471]  It will take out all known microbiological threats, including viral, bacterial, and cysts.
[00:34:24.191 --> 00:34:30.256]  And it will take out organic chemicals of pretty much everything, without exception.
[00:34:30.296 --> 00:34:32.198]  It's a very, very powerful device.
[00:34:32.882 --> 00:34:37.883]  I don't believe that there's anything else out there in the world that can do that, especially under gravity flow conditions.
[00:34:38.284 --> 00:34:40.024]  The fit and finish are fantastic.
[00:34:40.044 --> 00:34:43.805]  No compromise was made on the quality of the construction.
[00:34:44.845 --> 00:34:51.887]  So, I mean, it's really a remarkable achievement on their part, and I feel very proud, actually, to be part of the team that put that together.
[00:34:52.447 --> 00:34:54.208]  What's your view overall on fluoride?
[00:34:54.983 --> 00:35:04.051]  Well, okay, so we actually tested against both the fluoride ion and the fluorosilicate that you mentioned, which is the additive that people put into water under federal control.
[00:35:04.591 --> 00:35:08.394]  And basically, we removed both of them with equal efficiency.
[00:35:08.795 --> 00:35:14.079]  So we wanted to be sure that no matter how fluoride is added to the water, it can be intercepted and removed.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.521]  So that's how we've dealt with that.
[00:35:16.841 --> 00:35:21.165]  All I can tell you is that we tested against all known fluoride chemicals that are added to water.
[00:35:21.673 --> 00:35:25.555]  The new ones and the old ones, and we removed them all of equal efficiency.
[00:35:25.575 --> 00:35:30.858]  And it's your belief that this is the best gravity-fed filter of the design out there available to the public?
[00:35:31.498 --> 00:35:32.159]  Without a doubt.
[00:35:32.379 --> 00:35:37.161]  I mean, most of these gravity flow filters are at best simple particulate filters.
[00:35:37.562 --> 00:35:40.283]  They remove dirt and debris, sediment.
[00:35:40.903 --> 00:35:43.725]  They're not going to be capable of intercepting a viral particle.
[00:35:44.484 --> 00:35:47.605]  To the degree, we're talking quantitative reduction below detection.
[00:35:47.825 --> 00:35:49.586]  No one can touch that kind of capability.
[00:35:49.746 --> 00:35:54.427]  Well, I'm impressed and I want to thank you so much for your time today.
[00:35:54.847 --> 00:36:04.350]  It is the Alexa Pure Pro family of water filtration systems available discounted exclusively at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:36:04.971 --> 00:36:08.652]  I want to thank Mr. Redhawk for allowing us to be part of the launch of this.
[00:36:09.512 --> 00:36:12.174]  It's on sale right now for their main unit, $177.
[00:36:12.534 --> 00:36:15.176]  Leading competitors that aren't even as good or more than that.
[00:36:15.196 --> 00:36:25.522]  And they've also got the survival spring type straw system for survival that is an absolute must-have.
[00:36:30.404 --> 00:36:46.601]  And so while they were building the Trojan horse, while they were putting their grid in place, which is now basically in place for this AI takeover, and that's in Google's own words, founded 16 years ago, they met and said, listen, we're not just building a search engine, we're not just working with DARPA and In-Q-Tel and the CIA.
[00:36:46.942 --> 00:36:48.223]  This is like in Wire Magazine now.
[00:36:49.264 --> 00:36:51.805]  And I was told this by NSA insiders like 14 years ago.
[00:36:51.885 --> 00:36:53.146]  Now it's in the news.
[00:36:53.766 --> 00:37:06.951]  Oh, we set out to build an artificially intelligent system that interfaces with billions of humans in lifetime and that basically humans are now nodes or eyeballs or robot droids or drones of Google.
[00:37:07.691 --> 00:37:10.632]  And Google is allowed to get past laws, other people can't.
[00:37:11.032 --> 00:37:17.973]  Google has this government relationship with NASA, you name it, nobody else has, because it is really a governmental institution.
[00:37:18.293 --> 00:37:19.813]  And I don't want to single Google out.
[00:37:20.674 --> 00:37:28.575]  Google compared to like Apple, which is even bigger, and some of these other globalist corporations, is actually, are nice guys compared.
[00:37:29.075 --> 00:37:32.936]  And I don't just say that because, you know, I don't want to mess with Google, that's just the truth.
[00:37:33.536 --> 00:37:48.828]  That they understand keep the web free keep it somewhat open while they grow to get their data to be able to become a sentient AI system and many scientists believe and we'll put the articles up here on screen that Google has already actually become
[00:37:50.409 --> 00:37:59.396]  Take your destiny in your hands and don't let these people control your future and dominate who you are.
[00:37:59.836 --> 00:38:12.306]  Discover what's really happening and realize that everything you do, the energy you expend, is being sucked off by these people to build their castle in the clouds, to build their world and you're not supposed to have any part of that.
[00:38:13.007 --> 00:38:13.888]  That's a load of crap.
[00:38:14.508 --> 00:38:19.232]  We're going to expose what's happening and we're going to, by our actions, change what these groups are doing.
[00:38:20.073 --> 00:38:22.175]  We're going to reach out to the executives of these companies.
[00:38:22.195 --> 00:38:24.937]  We're going to reach out to their children, their wives, their husbands.
[00:38:25.237 --> 00:38:30.162]  We're going to lay out an alternative to this program that's based on free will.
[00:38:30.462 --> 00:38:37.148]  And I assure you, if you take action and get involved in that discussion and creating that reality, these systems will fall.
[00:38:37.448 --> 00:38:38.549]  They're scared of you.
[00:38:38.849 --> 00:38:40.650]  And they know once humanity's unchained,
[00:38:41.331 --> 00:38:43.853]  They're not going to be able to have their control of the future and play God.
[00:38:44.113 --> 00:38:45.254]  And that's what they're scared of.
[00:38:45.754 --> 00:38:49.677]  But this fight's been played out in this universe many times, believe that.
[00:38:50.497 --> 00:38:53.499]  And 999 times out of a thousand, they failed.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.301]  And that's why they're so scared.
[00:38:56.041 --> 00:38:58.643]  They've gotten better at what they do, but in the end, they will fall.
[00:38:59.023 --> 00:38:59.804]  Is the street okay?
[00:38:59.884 --> 00:39:00.524]  We're welcome inside?
[00:39:02.145 --> 00:39:02.566]  Well, thank you.
[00:39:02.586 --> 00:39:02.986]  You're sweet.
[00:39:04.822 --> 00:39:08.646]  I'm not sure everyone here would like to be on camera per se.
[00:39:08.686 --> 00:39:10.388]  It's a public event so you can come in.
[00:39:10.888 --> 00:39:11.729]  You work with Google, ma'am?
[00:39:11.749 --> 00:39:12.250]  They're very nice.
[00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:13.231]  I do, I do.
[00:39:13.251 --> 00:39:17.756]  When are they coming out with robots to replace you is what I want to know because you're too nice.
[00:39:17.796 --> 00:39:21.580]  So yeah, we happen to be hosting the city and the county here for an event.
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.222]  I'd actually appreciate not
[00:39:23.848 --> 00:39:24.548]  Alright, well you're being sweet.
[00:39:24.588 --> 00:39:33.051]  We just wanted to show that Google watches us and listens to us on the internet, and we just came and just figured people would freak out if we had a camera, which they kind of did.
[00:39:33.431 --> 00:39:37.813]  And there's a sign saying, though, that Google videotapes you inside, so we just... It's just all cameras.
[00:39:37.853 --> 00:39:39.013]  I mean, that's all we're showing.
[00:39:39.033 --> 00:39:41.274]  So I'd appreciate not being... Okay, well you're sweet.
[00:39:41.454 --> 00:39:42.655]  Hey, officers, be safe tonight.
[00:39:44.075 --> 00:39:44.976]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[00:39:45.016 --> 00:39:45.316]  Thank you.
[00:39:46.696 --> 00:39:47.617]  Well, thanks for putting up with me.
[00:39:48.197 --> 00:39:48.997]  Thank you, appreciate it.
[00:39:49.057 --> 00:39:50.057]  Couple listeners.
[00:39:50.778 --> 00:39:51.438]  Alright, anyways.
[00:39:52.671 --> 00:39:53.932]  Listen, we care about humans.
[00:39:53.992 --> 00:39:54.773]  We are the resistance.
[00:39:55.433 --> 00:39:57.955]  Just remember, robots take all your family's jobs in a few years.
[00:39:57.995 --> 00:39:58.336]  We're here.
[00:39:58.376 --> 00:39:59.076]  We're here for the people.
[00:39:59.577 --> 00:40:00.297]  We're here for the humans.
[00:40:00.317 --> 00:40:01.719]  Alright, we're standing up as hard as we can.
[00:40:02.339 --> 00:40:03.320]  Later it's going to get bad.
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:04.501]  You'll break the conditioning then.
[00:40:04.541 --> 00:40:04.781]  Okay.
[00:40:05.101 --> 00:40:05.642]  Thank you very much.
[00:40:05.662 --> 00:40:06.102]  Appreciate it.
[00:40:07.563 --> 00:40:13.749]  And folks, if you want to stand up against the artificial intelligence that is Google, the NSA, and the corporate globalists,
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.041]  The now is the time.
[00:40:16.241 --> 00:40:26.929]  Their mothership, or their main takeover carcinogen metastasization system is at the corner of Colorado and 2nd Street in Austin, Texas.
[00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:29.371]  And again, nothing against those poor people inside.
[00:40:29.391 --> 00:40:30.912]  They have no idea what we're even talking about.
[00:40:31.793 --> 00:40:33.194]  We're not mad at them putting their hands on us.
[00:40:33.214 --> 00:40:35.316]  We're not mad at them trying to protect their
[00:40:35.936 --> 00:40:37.497]  Their cyborg takeover system.
[00:40:37.857 --> 00:40:38.997]  We understand they're dumbed down.
[00:40:39.057 --> 00:40:40.818]  That's who we're reaching out to.
[00:40:41.418 --> 00:40:43.699]  That's who we're trying to stand up for.
[00:40:44.039 --> 00:40:47.721]  But again, we're going to be showing during this report Google's admissions, Samsung's admissions.
[00:40:47.961 --> 00:40:50.202]  We're watching or listening in your house.
[00:40:51.022 --> 00:40:53.323]  And I'm going to do another stunt next week as I promised.
[00:40:53.343 --> 00:40:54.304]  We're going to go to people's houses.
[00:40:54.864 --> 00:40:57.225]  Mainly Democrats and some of the folks we know that are
[00:40:58.283 --> 00:40:59.124]  It'll be very interesting.
[00:41:16.497 --> 00:41:19.238]  Because, because this is only the beginning.
[00:41:19.619 --> 00:41:22.200]  The general public thinks groveling to tyranny gets them ahead.
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:31.824]  We've had a lot of fans come by, we had just had some guy walk by, thinking he's powerful, because they're so cowardly, they just think grovel to the system, they're gonna get ahead.
[00:41:32.705 --> 00:41:34.886]  Anthony Gucciardi, anything else you'd like to add?
[00:41:35.026 --> 00:41:37.987]  Well, it's just like when I went to the NSA, I guess it was about two years ago.
[00:41:38.007 --> 00:41:39.108]  We ought to show some clips of that.
[00:41:39.328 --> 00:41:40.048]  So, here, Josh.
[00:41:41.108 --> 00:41:42.149]  We've been here three...
[00:41:44.011 --> 00:41:45.432]  Hey, we're just trying to find out.
[00:41:45.472 --> 00:41:48.074]  We just want to ask a few questions of your commanding officer.
[00:41:49.415 --> 00:41:51.916]  Alright, we're getting screamed at by the NSA agent.
[00:41:51.936 --> 00:41:54.978]  He's getting his car screaming at us, telling us to turn those cameras off right now.
[00:41:55.719 --> 00:41:56.900]  And he is very upset.
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:58.021]  He is very mad.
[00:41:58.141 --> 00:41:59.401]  Hey, we're saying we're on live feed.
[00:41:59.422 --> 00:42:00.082]  First Amendment.
[00:42:00.422 --> 00:42:01.523]  We're saying First Amendment.
[00:42:01.543 --> 00:42:02.744]  We just want to ask some questions.
[00:42:03.164 --> 00:42:04.225]  He's going up to Josh.
[00:42:04.465 --> 00:42:06.386]  He's about to take the camera from Josh.
[00:42:07.087 --> 00:42:09.949]  Hey guys, we're just journalists here.
[00:42:10.908 --> 00:42:11.969]  We're just journalists.
[00:42:12.649 --> 00:42:13.589]  We're just trying.
[00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:16.091]  We're live-streaming right now on Alex Jones Show.
[00:42:16.131 --> 00:42:17.391]  Hey, excuse me, excuse me.
[00:42:17.471 --> 00:42:18.031]  Hey, hey.
[00:42:18.272 --> 00:42:19.692]  He cut the live feed.
[00:42:19.712 --> 00:42:22.193]  Alex, he just cut the live feed.
[00:42:23.434 --> 00:42:27.636]  We went up there, me and Josh, and we rolled up, and I asked them for their ID.
[00:42:27.996 --> 00:42:32.598]  And I guess the military police at the Utah NSA headquarters didn't like that too much.
[00:42:33.119 --> 00:42:36.380]  And I said, well, you get our information all the time.
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.181]  I want to see your ID.
[00:42:38.041 --> 00:42:39.303]  And of course they arrested us.
[00:42:39.863 --> 00:42:41.165]  Took all of our videos.
[00:42:41.666 --> 00:42:43.047]  But we're too dumb to actually erase them.
[00:42:43.067 --> 00:42:44.349]  Too dumb to actually erase them.
[00:42:44.729 --> 00:42:45.951]  Took everything we had.
[00:42:45.971 --> 00:42:46.852]  It was on live stream.
[00:42:46.872 --> 00:42:48.294]  I kept saying this is being live streamed.
[00:42:48.454 --> 00:42:49.175]  People already see this.
[00:42:49.455 --> 00:42:50.396]  This is being live streamed.
[00:42:50.497 --> 00:42:51.838]  This is on air to millions of people.
[00:42:52.439 --> 00:42:55.923]  And they told us if we came back we'd be put in a military detainment center.
[00:42:56.684 --> 00:42:58.945]  For me, going into a parking lot.
[00:42:58.965 --> 00:43:00.066]  I couldn't even get to their HQ.
[00:43:00.306 --> 00:43:01.146]  Went to their parking lot.
[00:43:01.166 --> 00:43:02.867]  But if you were ISIS, they would give you weapons.
[00:43:03.047 --> 00:43:06.809]  Yeah, if I was an undocumented migrant, I'd probably be let in immediately.
[00:43:07.169 --> 00:43:10.110]  But the whole point is... The point is these people are taking down America.
[00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:10.571]  Exactly.
[00:43:10.611 --> 00:43:12.732]  We do these stupid, silly things... It's a globalist takeover!
[00:43:12.932 --> 00:43:13.572]  ...to make a point.
[00:43:13.612 --> 00:43:14.973]  We're an open, free society.
[00:43:15.113 --> 00:43:16.714]  They are just carving us up.
[00:43:17.274 --> 00:43:19.015]  And we're just here showing...
[00:43:20.051 --> 00:43:21.252]  What a joke it is, exactly.
[00:43:21.292 --> 00:43:28.916]  We're just here desperately trying to get people to become aware of, are we land of the chumps, home of the schmucks, or are we land of the free, home of the brave?
[00:43:28.956 --> 00:43:29.216]  Anthony?
[00:43:29.556 --> 00:43:30.056]  Exactly.
[00:43:31.177 --> 00:43:37.200]  It's a stunt to show what they're doing in a more abrupt way, where this actually happens in a way that you can see it.
[00:43:37.981 --> 00:43:42.263]  We walk in, they get upset, but your information is being stolen and you're not upset about it, right?
[00:43:42.363 --> 00:43:43.504]  We go in there, they get upset.
[00:43:43.724 --> 00:43:46.085]  We go in there and they freak out that we're at Google.
[00:43:47.341 --> 00:43:52.709]  And that we dare even... Record anything they do, but they can record everything we do and that's fine.
[00:43:53.089 --> 00:43:58.276]  Just like the NSA guys, I ask for their ID, they think I'm insane, but they have everything on me that I've ever done in my entire life.
[00:43:58.296 --> 00:43:59.197]  We have random folks walking by.
[00:43:59.218 --> 00:44:00.059]  Sir, do you have a comment?
[00:44:01.886 --> 00:44:02.466]  I don't have a comment.
[00:44:02.486 --> 00:44:02.867]  Not right now.
[00:44:02.927 --> 00:44:03.067]  I agree.
[00:44:03.087 --> 00:44:03.267]  I agree.
[00:44:03.287 --> 00:44:03.487]  I'm tired.
[00:44:03.527 --> 00:44:03.927]  It's been a long day.
[00:44:03.947 --> 00:44:04.327]  No, definitely not.
[00:44:27.355 --> 00:44:28.176]  I believe in progress.
[00:44:28.256 --> 00:44:29.037]  I think we're progressing.
[00:44:29.337 --> 00:44:34.483]  Well, the IQs are dropping, and the brainwaves are dropping, and the neural tissue is rotting.
[00:44:34.723 --> 00:44:35.484]  So we're not progressing.
[00:44:35.504 --> 00:44:37.386]  I think it's three steps forward and two steps back.
[00:44:38.707 --> 00:44:40.469]  But I think generally things are progressing.
[00:44:41.009 --> 00:44:42.291]  And the people running things, they love us?
[00:44:43.692 --> 00:44:44.233]  Uh, no.
[00:44:44.553 --> 00:44:46.555]  That's too abstract.
[00:44:46.575 --> 00:44:48.237]  Bernie Sanders loves us?
[00:44:49.409 --> 00:44:53.511]  Old Bernie said China has really great babies' rights, infant rights.
[00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:54.332]  Yeah.
[00:44:55.112 --> 00:44:55.812]  Do you agree with that?
[00:44:56.172 --> 00:44:58.414]  I've made my statement and that is all I'm going to say.
[00:44:58.434 --> 00:45:00.735]  Bernie Sanders is great, but don't back up Bernie Sanders.
[00:45:01.735 --> 00:45:04.837]  What about China killing 50 million girls, including after they're born?
[00:45:05.237 --> 00:45:05.897]  You don't even know about that?
[00:45:07.218 --> 00:45:07.818]  She doesn't know.
[00:45:07.878 --> 00:45:08.919]  That's a shield against that.
[00:45:09.259 --> 00:45:12.061]  And so Bernie Sanders is great, and China has the model.
[00:45:14.042 --> 00:45:14.482]  Time to go.
[00:45:15.002 --> 00:45:16.023]  Bye.
[00:45:16.503 --> 00:45:17.183]  Take care, man.
[00:45:17.584 --> 00:45:17.924]  Be safe.
[00:45:17.944 --> 00:45:18.704]  See, it's all funny.
[00:45:19.124 --> 00:45:22.606]  Bernie Sanders is going to save us, but China has got great stuff for babies.
[00:45:23.506 --> 00:45:25.487]  And then, like, kind of videotape.
[00:45:25.527 --> 00:45:26.868]  Like, you videotape us, we videotape you.
[00:45:26.888 --> 00:45:27.768]  Like, we're intimidated by that.
[00:45:28.248 --> 00:45:29.349]  We go up against the New World Order.
[00:45:30.229 --> 00:45:34.091]  But see how they've instilled a love of destruction, a love of enslavement in these people?
[00:45:36.012 --> 00:45:37.092]  Well, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:37.152 --> 00:45:38.333]  Alex Jones inside Google.
[00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:41.491]  Simply saying, hey, you watch us, we watch you.
[00:45:41.851 --> 00:45:48.873]  And we're going to recommend InfoWarriors in the next few weeks come down here by the thousands and come in with your phones and do live reports surveilling them.
[00:45:49.093 --> 00:45:50.253]  They won't be able to stop the signal.
[00:45:50.574 --> 00:45:52.094]  Alex Jones for InfoWars.com.
[00:45:52.334 --> 00:45:54.295]  If you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:46:04.281 --> 00:46:05.842]  And all you ISIS people threatening us?
[00:46:06.102 --> 00:46:07.543]  Hey, we're not a French newspaper.
[00:46:08.044 --> 00:46:08.264]  Okay?
[00:46:08.564 --> 00:46:11.426]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:46:11.626 --> 00:46:13.327]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:46:13.347 --> 00:46:14.628]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:46:14.988 --> 00:46:15.689]  This is Texas.
[00:46:15.909 --> 00:46:16.750]  You wanna threaten me?
[00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:17.910]  You can go straight to hell.
[00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:18.591]  You understand that?
[00:46:18.751 --> 00:46:24.475]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 Proof.
[00:46:24.935 --> 00:46:28.778]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:44.387]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:46:44.727 --> 00:46:46.208]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:46:46.228 --> 00:46:47.610]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:48.991]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:46:49.552 --> 00:46:54.336]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:54.436 --> 00:46:58.540]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.401]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:47:00.421 --> 00:47:01.763]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:47:01.803 --> 00:47:03.925]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:47:07.915 --> 00:47:12.757]  And why wearing a Hillary for President t-shirt might get you punched in the face?
[00:47:13.157 --> 00:47:15.018]  They thought it said Hillary for President.
[00:47:15.878 --> 00:47:20.339]  He said, I was seconds away from sending my bar back over here to punch you in the face.
[00:47:20.579 --> 00:47:24.441]  Since you're wearing a Hillary for Prison shirt, you don't have to buy drinks here.
[00:47:24.721 --> 00:47:25.821]  Everything's on the house.
[00:47:26.301 --> 00:47:27.362]  Hillary for President!
[00:47:28.022 --> 00:47:29.723]  Hillary's not surging, I tell you that.
[00:47:29.763 --> 00:47:30.503]  They're not saying that.
[00:47:31.503 --> 00:47:32.164]  They're not saying that.
[00:47:32.944 --> 00:47:33.264]  Thank you.
[00:48:04.986 --> 00:48:05.566]  There you have it.
[00:48:05.646 --> 00:48:08.407]  Donald Trump endorses Hillary for prison.
[00:48:08.987 --> 00:48:13.109]  Get your Hillary for prison 2016 t-shirt at the Infowars store.
[00:48:13.389 --> 00:48:16.010]  And on the back it says, legalize freedom.
[00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:20.151]  Show your disapproval of Hillary by buying your t-shirt today.
[00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:21.711]  But what she's done is criminal.
[00:48:22.872 --> 00:48:25.453]  This is an American president.
[00:48:25.793 --> 00:48:26.933]  Just add puppet.
[00:48:27.313 --> 00:48:29.634]  Then vote and repeat every four years.
[00:48:41.135 --> 00:48:52.004]  Well, the news that the Texas Office of the Inspector General raided several Planned Parenthood facilities yesterday was quite surprising, and my guest today might have had a lot to do with that.
[00:48:52.424 --> 00:49:06.156]  Now, Abby Johnson is a former Planned Parenthood director turned whistleblower, and also now you're the founder of AbortionWorker.com, where you're striving to reach directly the clinic workers themselves, as well as the abortionists and the doctors.
[00:49:07.256 --> 00:49:08.437]  So welcome back to the studio.
[00:49:09.238 --> 00:49:13.719]  Now last time you were here, you were just about to testify before the Texas Senate there.
[00:49:13.739 --> 00:49:21.342]  They were holding a hearing responding to those gruesome undercover videos that were released throughout this year.
[00:49:22.722 --> 00:49:24.243]  Tell me what you think about the response.
[00:49:26.314 --> 00:49:27.796]  Yeah, you know, it was interesting.
[00:49:27.816 --> 00:49:44.894]  I mean, even in the hearing, I mean, those that want to defend Planned Parenthood, those that are in places of power because of Planned Parenthood, because of their PAC money, because they've essentially gotten them into office,
[00:49:45.996 --> 00:49:49.680]  You know, they sort of have the same talking points over and over again.
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:59.953]  I thought it was interesting, actually, in the hearing, one of the ladies, Garcia, said, she asked me, you know, how much are you getting paid to be here today?
[00:50:00.033 --> 00:50:02.155]  And I just, I love being able to answer nothing.
[00:50:03.336 --> 00:50:19.481]  I'm doing this because I believe that Planned Parenthood is doing the wrong thing and I think that they're misusing, I know that they're misusing our tax money and I was really just really excited to see the OIG taking this so seriously and going into these affiliate
[00:50:20.081 --> 00:50:20.782]  Thank you.
[00:50:36.531 --> 00:50:36.931]  Exactly.
[00:50:36.991 --> 00:50:40.714]  I know several states have been moving to defund Planned Parenthood.
[00:50:41.454 --> 00:50:42.935]  Texas, of course, is one of them.
[00:50:43.456 --> 00:50:53.222]  Now, I did recall in the Senate hearing one of the witnesses there giving the testimony said that a lot of times the clinics would be tipped off before there were inspections.
[00:50:53.622 --> 00:50:57.985]  And so sometimes they were able to hide whatever activities they were doing because they'd be tipped off.
[00:50:58.005 --> 00:51:00.867]  Do you think something like that could have happened here with this raid?
[00:51:01.347 --> 00:51:03.269]  We learned just last week Planned Parenthood
[00:51:03.809 --> 00:51:07.993]  Decided to stop selling the aborted fetuses, even though they weren't doing anything wrong.
[00:51:08.173 --> 00:51:08.674]  Right, yeah.
[00:51:09.355 --> 00:51:10.095]  I don't think so.
[00:51:10.175 --> 00:51:22.507]  I mean, knowing what's been taking place here with the OIG's office, they were very quiet about what was taking place and what they were looking for.
[00:51:23.508 --> 00:51:37.641]  And the fact that Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast out of Houston was so resistant to even letting them come in and look at anything tells me that they were not prepared for these inspectors to come in.
[00:51:39.373 --> 00:51:40.514]  And so, that's good.
[00:51:40.714 --> 00:51:53.665]  I mean, we need surprise inspections because, I mean, like I said in the hearing, gosh, any time that there was a, we knew every time our inspector was coming in from the state, I would have all of the documents ready for her.
[00:51:53.745 --> 00:51:58.969]  You know, she just came in, here's what you need to look at, here's the charts that I pulled for you.
[00:51:58.989 --> 00:52:03.713]  Right, we see that a lot in the government agencies investigating themselves.
[00:52:03.793 --> 00:52:03.993]  Sure.
[00:52:04.453 --> 00:52:04.614]  Right.
[00:52:05.174 --> 00:52:05.474]  No different.
[00:52:05.494 --> 00:52:10.098]  What do you think about the fact Planned Parenthood is saying that this is a politically charged document hunt?
[00:52:10.419 --> 00:52:11.360]  They're not going to find anything.
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:15.083]  Well, I'm sure they would like to believe that they're not going to find anything.
[00:52:15.183 --> 00:52:21.388]  And honestly, maybe some of the affiliates, they won't find any sort of Medicaid abuses or Medicaid fraud.
[00:52:21.428 --> 00:52:31.377]  But, you know, I know for a fact that it was taking place at Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, which is the largest affiliate in our state, one of the largest in the country.
[00:52:32.578 --> 00:52:43.380]  I find it hard to believe that an affiliate that large in the state would be acting alone when they were participating in these fraudulent transactions.
[00:52:45.081 --> 00:52:47.301]  But I think that they absolutely will find something.
[00:52:47.501 --> 00:52:53.823]  And I think that the OIG has enough information so that they know where to look.
[00:52:53.843 --> 00:52:55.743]  Because that's been one of the problems, I think, with
[00:52:56.263 --> 00:53:02.928]  Sort of this federal investigation is, you know, one of the reps from the oversight committee came out and said, well, we just didn't, we didn't find anything.
[00:53:02.968 --> 00:53:03.988]  We didn't find anything wrong.
[00:53:04.389 --> 00:53:09.352]  And I think one of the reasons is because they really don't know where to look and they don't know what they're looking for.
[00:53:09.372 --> 00:53:15.876]  I mean, Planned Parenthood is an expert at protecting themselves, at covering their tracks.
[00:53:16.597 --> 00:53:24.282]  And so you really have to have somebody that knows where to look and what to look for helping guide these inspectors as they're going in.
[00:53:24.642 --> 00:53:25.462]  Where they might be hiding it.
[00:53:25.502 --> 00:53:33.646]  I believe that you mentioned in your testimony there that it was, you'd have to look in a certain line item on people's paychecks and things like that.
[00:53:33.886 --> 00:53:34.626]  Right.
[00:53:34.646 --> 00:53:47.652]  It's all about line items for Planned Parenthood, and they are good at, they're the best, really, at disguising fraudulent claims in line items of AR reports that come in.
[00:53:47.972 --> 00:53:48.172]  Mm-hmm.
[00:53:48.752 --> 00:53:52.353]  And so what do you think about this issue now being heavily politicized?
[00:53:52.393 --> 00:53:56.374]  We see it on the left with Hillary Clinton bringing it in, and she's fighting for this.
[00:53:56.414 --> 00:54:02.636]  Of course, Cecile Richards' daughter is now working for the Clinton campaign, so I'm sure there's no conflict of interest there.
[00:54:02.656 --> 00:54:12.178]  And then Fiorina actually released part of the video, and she was attacked, of course, for saying what she so boldly and courageously spoke out about.
[00:54:12.798 --> 00:54:16.699]  So what do you think about this being tossed now as the new softball in the politics?
[00:54:17.159 --> 00:54:19.920]  Well, I mean, honestly, I'm glad that it's being talked about more.
[00:54:20.441 --> 00:54:24.703]  I'm glad that this is sort of on the forefront of people's minds.
[00:54:25.843 --> 00:54:35.127]  I think for a long time, people just sort of, they just sort of thought, well, Planned Parenthood is here and they're providing these good services and it's just a little bit of what they do.
[00:54:35.167 --> 00:54:35.648]  But now,
[00:54:36.348 --> 00:54:50.415]  You know, even if it was just one, a year, I mean, even if it was just one abortion a year, but you see how heinous it is, I think people are finally starting to see just how egregious abortion is and what it's actually doing to these unborn children.
[00:54:50.475 --> 00:54:57.218]  And that's sort of causing them to rise up and say, hey, look, it doesn't matter if it's one or if it's 300,000, it doesn't matter.
[00:54:57.238 --> 00:54:58.558]  This is wrong.
[00:54:58.598 --> 00:55:03.721]  That it's happening to one person is wrong enough that we need to stand up and speak out.
[00:55:04.551 --> 00:55:05.912]  Do you see it as a victory?
[00:55:05.932 --> 00:55:14.218]  I mean, even if it's a small victory that Planned Parenthood says they're going to stop selling aborted baby body parts, they're still going to be harvesting and donating them.
[00:55:14.559 --> 00:55:16.000]  They're just not going to be profiting off them.
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:20.723]  Even though they've admitted, you said that they didn't, they're not guilty of committing any crime.
[00:55:20.883 --> 00:55:21.404]  They're sort of...
[00:55:22.298 --> 00:55:23.559]  Yeah, backtracking a little bit.
[00:55:23.579 --> 00:55:27.740]  Acquiescing to the demands of everyone speaking out about how gruesome those videos were.
[00:55:28.161 --> 00:55:29.321]  I think it is a victory.
[00:55:29.341 --> 00:55:33.023]  I mean, it's certainly not the victory we want to see, right?
[00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:36.064]  But I think it is a stab because I think it's forcing
[00:55:37.745 --> 00:55:41.767]  I think it's forcing Planned Parenthood to have to actually admit that this is a problem.
[00:55:42.187 --> 00:55:51.931]  And that, you know, it's even a problem for some people who I have talked to who said, well, you know, I really didn't think anything was wrong with Planned Parenthood.
[00:55:51.971 --> 00:55:53.732]  I really didn't think anything was wrong with abortion.
[00:55:53.792 --> 00:55:58.054]  But gosh, seeing what's actually taking place, I mean, it's changing their minds.
[00:55:58.374 --> 00:55:59.575]  It definitely changed my mind.
[00:55:59.595 --> 00:56:02.257]  I don't know, you know, I've said that from the very beginning.
[00:56:02.277 --> 00:56:15.828]  I, you know, women, there's different circumstances for, for women, but to actually see those videos, it really makes you have to think of it and look at it in an entirely different way because it's not fetal tissue.
[00:56:15.888 --> 00:56:17.269]  It's not a cluster of cells.
[00:56:17.369 --> 00:56:20.452]  And you could actually see that with those videos, which is so important.
[00:56:20.472 --> 00:56:22.553]  And you have people actually debating
[00:56:23.354 --> 00:56:25.835]  The videos, admitting that they've never even seen them.
[00:56:26.355 --> 00:56:29.017]  Talking, they haven't done anything wrong, they've committed no crime.
[00:56:29.317 --> 00:56:31.398]  Admitting that they haven't even seen the videos.
[00:56:32.098 --> 00:56:36.240]  The people admitting to the things that they're doing on these videos, which I think is ridiculous.
[00:56:36.881 --> 00:56:45.705]  So, what do you think about the fact also that a lot of people say, well now, lower income families, women aren't going to be able to get their healthcare?
[00:56:46.584 --> 00:56:54.934]  Yeah, you know, that is probably the biggest myth perpetrated by Planned Parenthood is that they sort of have the market on health care for low-income women.
[00:56:55.515 --> 00:56:58.418]  It's a complete lie.
[00:56:58.438 --> 00:57:06.547]  Planned Parenthood does not exist in any community where there are not other health care options available for low-income families.
[00:57:07.348 --> 00:57:09.168]  And that's just, I mean, that's just the facts.
[00:57:09.228 --> 00:57:20.551]  I mean, Planned Parenthood is not in, they would like people to believe that they're in all these rural counties, rural places where there's nowhere else for women to get health care, but that's absolutely untrue.
[00:57:20.571 --> 00:57:29.192]  And even here alone in the state of Texas, I've been saying, you know, we've only have, we only have 35 Planned Parenthood facilities in this huge state of Texas.
[00:57:30.072 --> 00:57:31.573]  And we've got almost 5,000
[00:57:34.133 --> 00:57:50.103]  Centers, doctors, medical centers, health care facilities, who are able to take the Texas Women's Health Care Program, which is a state-funded program, does not pay for abortion, does not support providers that refer for abortion.
[00:57:50.763 --> 00:57:55.206]  And so that, you know, we have that program here in the state of Texas, and 35 clinics compared to 5,000.
[00:57:55.306 --> 00:57:58.148]  Right, and they need millions of dollars.
[00:57:58.308 --> 00:57:58.448]  Right.
[00:58:13.661 --> 00:58:18.986]  Not commit the illegal deeds that we allegedly saw on those undercover videos.
[00:58:19.447 --> 00:58:22.870]  And of course, they did respond by saying that they're no longer going to be doing this.
[00:58:23.451 --> 00:58:25.153]  Well, Abby, thank you so much for coming in.
[00:58:25.193 --> 00:58:29.577]  And of course, you're always welcome whenever anything is breaking in this area.
[00:58:29.617 --> 00:58:33.201]  I don't think this is the last of this Planned Parenthood saga.
[00:58:33.681 --> 00:58:34.982]  Well, thank you for watching the show tonight.
[00:58:35.022 --> 00:58:36.324]  We'll see you here again Monday, 7 p.m.
[00:58:36.404 --> 00:58:36.684]  Central.
[00:58:48.823 --> 00:58:49.964]  Knockout is back.
[00:58:50.304 --> 00:59:01.411]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[00:59:01.831 --> 00:59:03.532]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:04.013 --> 00:59:13.158]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:13.539 --> 00:59:15.320]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.761]  It's the same price
[00:59:17.481 --> 00:59:23.364]  As leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece, it has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult.
[00:59:23.904 --> 00:59:30.148]  It's got the GABA, so it would probably cost $50 to take all this as separate pills.
[00:59:30.648 --> 00:59:30.768]  It's $19.95.
[00:59:31.488 --> 00:59:33.830]  You take one or two of these,
[00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:38.213]  And it just is really clean restful sleep is what the reviews are.
[00:59:38.554 --> 00:59:42.477]  It's what I've experienced and it just synergistically puts everything in there.
