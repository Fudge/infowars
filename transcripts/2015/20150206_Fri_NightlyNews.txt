[00:00:19.773 --> 00:00:21.896]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.936 --> 00:00:26.302]  It is Friday, February 6, 2015, and I'm Leigh-Anne McAdoo.
[00:00:32.216 --> 00:00:33.676]  Yes, it's confirmed.
[00:00:34.097 --> 00:00:42.059]  Illegal aliens now qualify to receive tax refunds, thanks to Barack Obama's new amnesty program.
[00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:48.700]  Then, a new study claims that marijuana is likely effective against depression.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.881]  Hey bud, let's party!
[00:00:51.457 --> 00:01:04.622]  But I doubt a case of the munchies will even get you to try Michelle Obama's lunch program as students across the country are posting pictures of their disgusting cafeteria food.
[00:01:05.042 --> 00:01:09.424]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:16.414 --> 00:01:22.676]  Got another alarming consequence of President Obama's executive amnesty right in time for tax season.
[00:01:23.176 --> 00:01:29.499]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is another loophole, another loophole in the tax code.
[00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:34.960]  It's going to allow illegal immigrants to immediately receive amnesty bonuses.
[00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:40.122]  Those with deferred status may be able to receive the earned income tax credit.
[00:01:40.702 --> 00:01:44.784]  And this is, you know, someone we're talking about who is here unlawfully, mind you, because
[00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:52.450]  Congress hasn't passed an immigration reform that the president approves of just yet, and he hasn't actually started enforcing any reform.
[00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:04.020]  So these people are still here unlawfully, but they could be able to file an amended tax return for up to the last three tax years, possibly receiving upwards of $24,000 in tax credits.
[00:02:07.583 --> 00:02:10.385]  Now this discovery was made by Eileen O'Connor.
[00:02:10.425 --> 00:02:14.247]  She's a tax lawyer and the former head of the tax division of the U.S.
[00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:15.348]  Department of Justice.
[00:02:15.888 --> 00:02:22.772]  She says the law makes a social security number a requirement of eligibility to receive the earned income credit.
[00:02:23.232 --> 00:02:32.418]  When a person receives a social security number, he can then file amended returns to claim the credit for the three preceding years during which he did not.
[00:02:33.138 --> 00:02:43.950]  And because of an old law in 1999, something was passed that would allow people to retroactively claim credits when once they receive a social security number.
[00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.336]  So obviously some puzzling logic there because they didn't qualify for the proceeding.
[00:02:50.237 --> 00:02:52.799]  Years, but now they will, because of this loophole.
[00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:58.883]  Senator Sasse, along with Senator Ron Johnson, have released statements regarding these amnesty bonuses.
[00:02:59.263 --> 00:03:18.077]  Basically saying, by offering illegal aliens new payments under the earned income tax credit, the IRS may encourage fraud among those who might claim children living in other countries, and the administration could blow open the doors for fraud with these amnesty bonuses of more than $24,000 to those who receive deferred actions.
[00:03:18.117 --> 00:03:18.277]  That's $24,000
[00:03:19.898 --> 00:03:20.258]  We're good.
[00:03:37.358 --> 00:03:50.147]  Now, you'll recall, we've reported on this before, but these two programs were responsible for $21 billion in improper payments, fraudulent payments, and claims in 2013 alone.
[00:03:50.527 --> 00:03:56.091]  So, of course, that's all taxpayer money that was just, whoop, oh, sorry, you didn't deserve that.
[00:03:56.211 --> 00:04:02.835]  And that just infuriates me because they also don't have to pay for the Obamacare penalty as well.
[00:04:03.215 --> 00:04:05.857]  But you can bet they'll come after you just like they did me for $100.
[00:04:07.678 --> 00:04:11.801]  But that's not the only tax fraud that you have to worry yourself with this season.
[00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:25.209]  If you file via TurboTax, they have just announced that they have done away with the ability to file eState tax returns because the company found an increase in suspicious filings.
[00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:33.851]  Basically they're seeing a lot of criminal activity where stolen personal data is used to file fake state returns with state authorities.
[00:04:34.251 --> 00:04:52.014]  This illegal act allows fraudsters to claim tax refunds from state governments and criminals are, they say the TurboTax says it's not a problem with their software but the criminals are accessing your data somewhere else and then they're using TurboTax to file and then I guess they're having those
[00:04:52.534 --> 00:04:53.055]  We're good.
[00:05:09.438 --> 00:05:12.459]  biometric database being set up for us.
[00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:21.623]  This is what they're wanting to do is have all of us have our own biometric data and that's how we can go ahead and file taxes and do anything with the government.
[00:05:21.923 --> 00:05:36.449]  And of course, situations like these where people are filing fraudulent tax returns is going to be something that's a big push toward everyone getting their biometric data as their login, password, and online identity.
[00:05:37.552 --> 00:05:44.338]  Now, perhaps in honor of Bob Marley's birthday today, Kit Daniels posted this story.
[00:05:44.818 --> 00:05:48.502]  Marijuana is likely ineffective against depression.
[00:05:48.522 --> 00:05:50.724]  Now this is according to researchers.
[00:05:50.804 --> 00:05:55.368]  They say cannabis could potentially help stabilize moods and ease depression.
[00:05:55.808 --> 00:06:00.730]  These are neuroscientists at the University of Buffalo's Research Institute on Addictions.
[00:06:01.291 --> 00:06:09.415]  They found that the chemicals in cannabis are comparable to the endocannabinoids that our own body produces, which combat pain and anxiety.
[00:06:09.735 --> 00:06:24.142]  And these findings also follow a recent study from some Australian researchers, which found that marijuana can ease chronic pain much more effectively than many conventional medications, which they say this drug is easier
[00:06:24.682 --> 00:06:31.147]  Then opioid medications which are highly addictive and can cause accidental overdoses.
[00:06:31.687 --> 00:06:35.390]  And you know I had a dad, my father had to go through chemotherapy.
[00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.013]  I saw my 200 pound 6'2 father going through chemotherapy.
[00:06:40.053 --> 00:06:47.158]  He ended up weighing about 125 pounds afterward and the only thing that worked for him was medicinal marijuana.
[00:06:47.178 --> 00:06:48.579]  It was the only thing that helped him.
[00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:50.140]  His doctor was able to get it to him.
[00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:53.423]  So I have personally seen the benefits of this.
[00:06:54.003 --> 00:07:01.088]  But Anthony Gucciardi goes on to say, just to remind people that this isn't, it doesn't have to be something that can get you high.
[00:07:01.408 --> 00:07:06.132]  They use industrial grade hemp, which is a high growing variety of cannabis.
[00:07:06.472 --> 00:07:13.477]  And it can be used in protein shakes, building materials, and oils that are used for the prevention and treatment of disease.
[00:07:13.837 --> 00:07:15.298]  It does not get you high.
[00:07:15.738 --> 00:07:19.041]  There are some very beneficial uses for this plant.
[00:07:19.061 --> 00:07:20.482]  A lot of people are pushing for it.
[00:07:21.182 --> 00:07:28.304]  We've just saw recently Peter Thiel, the founder of PayPal, became one of the biggest investors in medicinal marijuana.
[00:07:28.604 --> 00:07:37.306]  The Department of Justice announced last year that Native American tribes are free to grow and sell marijuana on their land.
[00:07:37.726 --> 00:07:44.968]  So we're definitely seeing a huge move towards medicinal marijuana becoming an accepted part of our society.
[00:07:45.008 --> 00:07:46.768]  There really is no reason that a plant
[00:07:47.248 --> 00:07:47.809]  I think so.
[00:08:06.522 --> 00:08:21.143]  Now the Marine veteran who killed Chris Kyle was allegedly suffering from PTSD, but InfoWars reporter Joe Biggs is going to break down some new revelations in that case that could affect the mainstream media's narrative.
[00:08:22.717 --> 00:08:24.159]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:35.491]  Now today I want to talk about Eddie Ray Roth, the former Marine who is responsible for shooting and killing Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield at a ranch in Texas back on February 2nd, 2013.
[00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:44.260]  The official narrative is that this guy had PTSD, was battle-hardened, and he essentially spazzed out, flipped out, turned the gun on these two guys.
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.160]  We're good to go.
[00:09:00.487 --> 00:09:05.730]  Favet is a man who sits on a FOB, which is a Forward Observation Base, and doesn't do anything.
[00:09:05.991 --> 00:09:18.778]  He plays solitaire, he runs errands for commanders who don't go outside the wire, probably helps with supplies, maybe works in the cafeteria or the DFAC, and does a lot of legwork around there.
[00:09:18.838 --> 00:09:21.100]  Never goes outside the wire, doesn't see any combat.
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:21.740]  We're good to go.
[00:09:43.966 --> 00:10:01.315]  On the base, they would take our stories and then create their own story out of that so they could, you know, write home to mom, dad, girlfriend, boyfriend, whoever, and seem like they're, you know, some kind of badass for actually going outside the wire, when in all actuality, they're the ones scooping our mashed potatoes and putting them on our plate.
[00:10:01.795 --> 00:10:05.217]  This guy was said to have had a very low ASVAB score.
[00:10:05.377 --> 00:10:07.558]  That is a test you take before you enter the military.
[00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.999]  Based off that score, you get a job if you have
[00:10:11.209 --> 00:10:13.190]  Or you'll get a job based off of your score.
[00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.312]  So if you have a low score like this guy did, then you become a fobbit.
[00:10:16.332 --> 00:10:17.233]  You don't do much at all.
[00:10:17.553 --> 00:10:18.474]  You do a lot of legwork.
[00:10:18.494 --> 00:10:24.958]  If you have a higher score, then you can go into special forces, things like that, aviation, you know, so forth and so on.
[00:10:25.578 --> 00:10:32.923]  This guy had a very low score, which means he was probably a pretty stupid guy and very easy to brainwash.
[00:10:33.503 --> 00:10:35.024]  So this is where I'm at now.
[00:10:35.064 --> 00:10:38.887]  If the guy didn't have PTSD, why would he have taken out Chris Kyle?
[00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:48.274]  This guy could have been easily brainwashed and they're saying at the Boston Bombings people saw the Kraft logo on people's hats and things like that.
[00:10:48.694 --> 00:11:02.544]  Now, this makes me think maybe Chris Kyle knew about the plant at the Boston Bombing and wanted no part of it and they took a guy like this, Eddie Ray Roth, and got him to go out there and essentially take out this guy who was a big figurehead.
[00:11:02.864 --> 00:11:08.648]  Someone that they know that could go out and say something and get a lot of people's attention and get a lot of publicity.
[00:11:10.151 --> 00:11:28.182]  It's something to think about, so tell us what you think in the comments below whether or not you think this is something that could have happened, but I do find it very interesting to know that this was a guy who didn't see any kind of combat experience, was never mortared, was never shot at, anything like that, and then all of a sudden he just flips out and shoots two people like that.
[00:11:28.482 --> 00:11:31.204]  So continue watching our reports here at InfoWars.com.
[00:11:31.404 --> 00:11:31.865]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:44.631]  Black Hawk helicopters were engaged in war games in Miami this week when all of a sudden, one of the choppers dropped a bomb-like ammunitions container overboard.
[00:11:45.151 --> 00:11:45.531]  Whoops!
[00:11:45.892 --> 00:11:50.897]  Now what are they doing flying choppers around Miami low-flying in residential areas?
[00:11:51.337 --> 00:11:54.559]  With boxes full of ammunition for training exercises.
[00:11:54.959 --> 00:11:59.481]  Now they said the silver ammo tin and its contents were recovered Thursday.
[00:11:59.541 --> 00:12:08.026]  The police would only say that the container was retrieved safely somewhere in the Northwest County and that it did not strike anyone's home.
[00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:09.327]  Oh, thank goodness!
[00:12:09.967 --> 00:12:14.210]  Now, Wayne Black of Wayne Black & Associates, he's a security and weapons expert.
[00:12:14.671 --> 00:12:23.117]  He told the news there that the container that fell would have held 1,000 rounds of ammunition and would have weighed about 50 pounds.
[00:12:23.838 --> 00:12:33.205]  When contacted, an Army Public Affairs officer declined to comment on this errant ammunitions canister or to what extent that they could have been held accountable.
[00:12:34.026 --> 00:12:38.329]  But he'd only say that his unit's mantra is, safety, safety, safety.
[00:12:38.709 --> 00:12:41.972]  But obviously not the safety of the people there in Miami.
[00:12:42.333 --> 00:12:49.600]  And heads up, if you are there in Miami, the Army says that the exercises are going to continue through next Thursday.
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:54.505]  The public is going to receive no notice of when and where these war games are going to be conducted.
[00:12:55.085 --> 00:12:56.347]  And the Army's release said that
[00:12:56.787 --> 00:13:01.192]  Every precaution will be taken to mitigate risks for the safety of all.
[00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:07.039]  So again, why are we having these live training exercises, these war game exercises?
[00:13:07.059 --> 00:13:10.703]  We're seeing them again in Miami, Chicago, California.
[00:13:11.744 --> 00:13:19.007]  Cropping up all over the country and it's getting pretty serious because now they're carrying around live ammo and oops, accidentally dropped.
[00:13:19.027 --> 00:13:21.228]  That's a mission fail if you ask me.
[00:13:21.308 --> 00:13:25.610]  Kind of like how they dropped all of the supplies there to ISIS recently.
[00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:30.832]  Now, open carriers in Washington state are planning a demonstration.
[00:13:31.473 --> 00:13:39.516]  They are protesting after the state there banned them from bringing their firearms into the Senate viewing area.
[00:13:39.896 --> 00:13:41.037]  Jakari Jackson has more.
[00:13:42.415 --> 00:13:45.256]  This is Jakari Jackson for InfoWars.com.
[00:13:45.676 --> 00:13:50.839]  Last month, the Washington State Senate said open carriers are no longer welcome in their viewing galleries.
[00:13:51.419 --> 00:13:59.362]  Lieutenant Governor Brad Owen announced that the public will no longer be able to openly carry firearms in the state Senate's chamber's public viewing area.
[00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:04.384]  We're not going to treat them any differently than everyone else, he said to open carry advocates.
[00:14:04.964 --> 00:14:08.506]  Owen said that it didn't make sense to allow people to openly carry firearms
[00:14:08.846 --> 00:14:09.326]  We're good to go.
[00:14:24.912 --> 00:14:37.265]  The Washington State Patrol is expected to arrest anyone entering the viewing chambers openly carrying a firearm, although individuals with a concealed pistol license will be allowed to conceal carry weapons into the chambers.
[00:14:37.725 --> 00:14:45.713]  And of course, we know in Washington State, Bloomberg and Bill Gates are up there pushing their anti-gun agenda, so we'll just have to wait and see how this turns out.
[00:14:46.334 --> 00:14:52.239]  And last year, you guys may also recall how Arkansas gun reigns, declaring itself to be a Muslim-free zone.
[00:14:52.679 --> 00:14:58.703]  But now, after the massacre that happened in Pakistan, Pakistani teachers are now being able to carry in the classroom.
[00:14:59.384 --> 00:15:09.091]  After 150 children and educators were killed by Taliban terrorists in a brutal massacre in December, the Pakistani government gave permission to teachers to be armed while at work.
[00:15:09.532 --> 00:15:12.574]  I'm very happy to see this, whether it's in Pakistan or here in the States.
[00:15:12.932 --> 00:15:18.655]  I think it's much better to arm the teachers than to give the kids Campbell soup cans and tell them to throw them at their attackers.
[00:15:19.115 --> 00:15:19.975]  And we'll end with this.
[00:15:20.535 --> 00:15:22.616]  Murder victim's sister on gun control group.
[00:15:23.057 --> 00:15:25.258]  Don't use her to push your agenda.
[00:15:26.518 --> 00:15:28.219]  I'm pretty averse about the bill.
[00:15:28.279 --> 00:15:29.620]  And I'm actually very against it.
[00:15:39.925 --> 00:15:46.353]  I'm very pro-gun, as is Jessie, so I would really hope that you guys don't use her story for anything.
[00:15:48.255 --> 00:15:51.799]  Because the only thing that would have saved her was a gun.
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:53.921]  That's it for now.
[00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:56.844]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:15:58.271 --> 00:16:05.477]  Well, Congress is getting ready to reauthorize Michelle Obama's Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act for this year.
[00:16:05.977 --> 00:16:15.745]  Now, obviously, we have seen some of these horrendous lunches, but students and parents are continuing to post photographic evidence of this program's shortcomings.
[00:16:16.165 --> 00:16:23.511]  Schools are, of course, complaining of increased costs and waste because these so-called healthy meals are being trashed.
[00:16:23.931 --> 00:16:26.474]  Just look at this disgusting lunch.
[00:16:26.674 --> 00:16:28.616]  What about that says healthy?
[00:16:28.736 --> 00:16:31.839]  It is processed salami meat and cheese.
[00:16:32.119 --> 00:16:33.881]  The salami is two different colors.
[00:16:33.941 --> 00:16:37.244]  It's moldy and it's inside of a tortilla.
[00:16:37.264 --> 00:16:40.747]  And if you scroll down, I mean it doesn't get any better.
[00:16:40.868 --> 00:16:42.069]  That looks disgusting.
[00:16:42.149 --> 00:16:43.770]  Nothing about that says healthy.
[00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.092]  I'm sure those carrots have been
[00:16:45.532 --> 00:16:47.835]  Can for the past four years.
[00:16:48.255 --> 00:16:49.977]  This looks like prison food.
[00:16:50.297 --> 00:16:55.082]  This is what is supposed to be the brain food for your children to make it through the rest of the day.
[00:16:55.403 --> 00:17:04.513]  We already know how GMOs and processed foods and food additives and things like this can make kids with ADD get even more excitable during class.
[00:17:04.813 --> 00:17:05.193]  Look at that!
[00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:06.674]  That is disgusting.
[00:17:07.114 --> 00:17:14.197]  Meanwhile, Michelle has an organic garden at the White House, and she's forcing this kind of crap on your kids.
[00:17:14.857 --> 00:17:22.579]  And, you know, then we've reported that schools are basically telling parents that they can't pack a lunch for their own children.
[00:17:22.939 --> 00:17:26.200]  That the children have to be invested in this program at school.
[00:17:26.661 --> 00:17:27.581]  That's disgusting.
[00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:34.546]  I'm going to go ahead and nominate Vani Hari, the Food Babe, to be in charge of school lunch programs.
[00:17:34.866 --> 00:17:36.047]  They're not going to let parents do it.
[00:17:36.087 --> 00:17:41.651]  Let's put someone in charge who actually will make a difference and will get some healthy food on the table.
[00:17:42.152 --> 00:17:47.536]  This is after another successful petition from the Food Babe Army.
[00:17:47.896 --> 00:17:51.759]  General Mills has started pulling preservatives from their products.
[00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:56.903]  She really went after the BHT, which is used to prolong the shelf life of foods.
[00:17:57.443 --> 00:18:02.965]  It's been banned in many parts of the world for having wreaked havoc during animal testing.
[00:18:03.546 --> 00:18:04.366]  Ah, but it's okay.
[00:18:04.526 --> 00:18:06.567]  Just give it to the fatties in the United States.
[00:18:06.607 --> 00:18:08.027]  They don't really care what's in their food.
[00:18:08.448 --> 00:18:17.351]  Well, the Food Babe launched her petition just yesterday, and initially General Mills hit back on Twitter saying, BHT is FDA approved.
[00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:20.713]  Oh, but we're already working on removing it from their products.
[00:18:20.733 --> 00:18:25.695]  This is how they initially responded, that it's perfectly safe, but we're taking it out of foods.
[00:18:26.175 --> 00:18:34.079]  Now, when the food babe was asked about why she went after BHT, she said what really upset her about it was this double standard.
[00:18:34.339 --> 00:18:40.962]  She said they'll make the same product for a different country and make it safer for people across the globe, but not us.
[00:18:41.342 --> 00:18:46.104]  They have tighter regulations in Europe because they operate on a precautionary principle.
[00:18:46.444 --> 00:18:49.646]  There, products are guilty until proven innocent.
[00:18:49.926 --> 00:18:51.507]  Here, it's the reverse.
[00:18:52.467 --> 00:18:54.208]  And I mean, that is so true.
[00:18:54.248 --> 00:18:56.468]  You see so many countries banning GMOs.
[00:18:56.828 --> 00:19:07.331]  If you get chocolate, even if you go to the part of the grocery store where they sell chocolate from other countries, it'll be the same exact chocolate, but it has different ingredients and it tastes so much better.
[00:19:07.451 --> 00:19:10.292]  Why do we have to always be the science experiment?
[00:19:10.812 --> 00:19:14.573]  Now, the Food Babe is going to be launching her new book next week.
[00:19:14.633 --> 00:19:17.274]  So be sure to tune into the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:17.294 --> 00:19:21.175]  She's going to be launching it exclusively at the Info Wars store first.
[00:19:21.755 --> 00:19:24.457]  But Food Babe is just a very powerful woman.
[00:19:24.537 --> 00:19:30.741]  She's just a regular girl, just like me and some of you out there, but just a normal person.
[00:19:30.822 --> 00:19:35.105]  She just did some research and she actually cared enough to take action.
[00:19:35.125 --> 00:19:40.428]  And of course, just with everyone's help, she was able to really make some things happen here.
[00:19:40.468 --> 00:19:44.531]  She's got caramel coloring taken out of beer and on and on.
[00:19:44.631 --> 00:19:46.573]  So she'll be on the show next week.
[00:19:46.613 --> 00:19:47.434]  Be sure to tune in.
[00:19:48.274 --> 00:19:53.018]  Now coming up, we have, like I said, a very full broadcast for you tonight.
[00:19:53.038 --> 00:20:04.526]  We'll have a couple reports about what they're not telling you about vaccines, and then we're going to really break down a secret Illuminati agenda for you that's coming up next.
[00:20:05.966 --> 00:20:07.608]  The knowledge of the ancients.
[00:20:07.948 --> 00:20:11.491]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:20:11.751 --> 00:20:14.353]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:18.096]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:20:18.316 --> 00:20:23.000]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:23.680]  We're good to go!
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.301]  With exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.

[00:21:05.883 --> 00:21:08.444]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[00:21:08.564 --> 00:21:09.704]  And the truth is, it's hard.
[00:21:09.984 --> 00:21:11.444]  Even with diet and exercise.
[00:21:11.644 --> 00:21:16.705]  Because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[00:21:16.825 --> 00:21:19.066]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry.
[00:21:19.346 --> 00:21:25.950]  I found that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise, were the answers that synergistically worked.
[00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:32.694]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[00:21:33.054 --> 00:21:38.958]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWars Life Resolution Pack, combining three essential formulations
[00:21:39.438 --> 00:21:47.183]  Oxygen-Based Cleanser Oxy Powder, The Secret 12 Bioavailable Vitamin B12, and your choice of Super Female or Super Male Vitality.
[00:21:47.343 --> 00:21:53.947]  Now all available at a discounted price to you and your family to bring in the new year and make 2015 a true success.
[00:21:54.307 --> 00:21:55.448]  That's Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:21:55.468 --> 00:21:58.630]  2015 is the year to do it and it all starts at Infowarslife.com.
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.282]  A new petition was launched this week.
[00:22:30.583 --> 00:22:33.685]  This one there, you can see it on the White House website.
[00:22:34.025 --> 00:22:40.431]  This one is to prohibit any laws mandating the force and requirement of vaccinations of any kind.
[00:22:40.511 --> 00:22:44.274]  So far, it has gained more than 11,000 signatures.
[00:22:44.314 --> 00:22:47.797]  You can see there's more than 80,000 that we still need.
[00:22:47.837 --> 00:22:52.821]  So go online, go to this whitehouse.gov, sign that petition.
[00:22:54.042 --> 00:23:02.907]  Basically, this is not about being anti-vaccine, and that's what's really making me angry with all the media right now covering the vaccines and anti-vaxxers and this whole movement.
[00:23:02.927 --> 00:23:05.168]  It's not about being against vaccines.
[00:23:05.588 --> 00:23:09.410]  It's against the mandatory injection of vaccines.
[00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:14.633]  It's being against some sort of external authority being able to inject something
[00:23:15.273 --> 00:23:19.157]  Foreign into you or your family's body against your will.
[00:23:19.438 --> 00:23:20.759]  That is the issue.
[00:23:20.839 --> 00:23:27.727]  That is a problem because regardless of what is being reported, the science is not 100% proven.
[00:23:28.147 --> 00:23:30.971]  Here is what they're not telling you about vaccines.
[00:23:32.714 --> 00:23:35.755]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:23:36.196 --> 00:23:41.238]  The anti-vaccine paranoia and hysteria has reached a fevered pitch.
[00:23:41.258 --> 00:23:43.099]  The Nightly News is covered with these stories.
[00:23:43.459 --> 00:23:46.240]  Anywhere on the web you look, even Jon Stewart's covering it.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:51.783]  Everybody is hating after the people who don't want to inject themselves with toxic substances and live viruses.
[00:23:52.683 --> 00:24:02.367]  Even a new Rasmussen National Television survey finds that 83% of American adults are at least somewhat concerned that children who do not receive vaccinations will cause health problems for other children.
[00:24:02.727 --> 00:24:06.709]  That title, as Americans insist, no vaccine, no school.
[00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:11.070]  That's right, they want to go after anybody who doesn't go with the status quo.
[00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:16.973]  If you're somebody that speaks out, if you're a sheep that strays from the flock, you must be beaten down.
[00:24:17.453 --> 00:24:19.854]  Vaccines are good!
[00:24:20.834 --> 00:24:29.018]  Governments that have been caught doing secret experiments by killing people in mass are trustworthy.
[00:24:29.859 --> 00:24:37.663]  But as we've been covering, there are many instances where we've proven that vaccines are causing the diseases that they're supposed to prevent.
[00:24:38.624 --> 00:24:40.104]  And there's many reasons why that is.
[00:24:40.705 --> 00:24:43.466]  One mainly is that they're injecting live viruses into your system.
[00:24:43.726 --> 00:24:48.289]  Here's an article, studies show that vaccinated individuals spread disease from Globe Newswire.
[00:24:49.406 --> 00:24:51.807]  And one of the statistics in here is shocking.
[00:24:52.208 --> 00:24:54.109]  The vaccine was introduced in 1963.
[00:24:54.169 --> 00:25:02.774]  Between 2005 and 2014, there have been no deaths from measles in the United States and 108 deaths from the MMR vaccine.
[00:25:03.214 --> 00:25:08.337]  So the vaccine has killed more people than the disease that it's trying to protect you from.
[00:25:08.797 --> 00:25:09.077]  Wow.
[00:25:09.598 --> 00:25:19.464]  You got a ton of hype from a childhood disease that just when I was a kid back in the 80s, if somebody got the measles or the chickenpox or the mumps in the neighborhood, we were sent over to that house to get that disease.
[00:25:19.504 --> 00:25:27.308]  In fact, I was able to get it from my brother and sister who had it before me and then stay home from school for two weeks, had a pretty good time.
[00:25:27.849 --> 00:25:29.070]  But no, not anymore.
[00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:29.950]  We can't have that.
[00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:33.892]  We can't have kids getting childhood diseases and then having lifetime immunity from them.
[00:25:34.233 --> 00:25:36.374]  No, we have to inject them with toxic substances.
[00:25:36.434 --> 00:25:37.595]  That is the only way out.
[00:25:38.355 --> 00:25:45.559]  I wonder if the CDC has conducted or facilitated a study comparing vaccinated children with unvaccinated children yet.
[00:25:45.799 --> 00:25:46.359]  Have you done that?
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.041]  We have not studied vaccinated versus unvaccinated.
[00:25:52.182 --> 00:25:52.602]  Never mind.
[00:25:52.822 --> 00:25:53.322]  Stop there.
[00:25:53.382 --> 00:25:54.743]  That was the meaning of my question.
[00:25:54.783 --> 00:25:55.884]  You wasted two minutes of my time.
[00:25:56.164 --> 00:26:01.286]  So we have lots of hysteria, but not a lot of facts backing it up, especially with this herd immunity.
[00:26:01.807 --> 00:26:05.128]  And here we go on the CDC websites talking about a 2014 measles outbreak.
[00:26:07.382 --> 00:26:13.424]  Many of the cases in 2014 were associated with cases brought in from the Philippines which experienced a large measles outbreak.
[00:26:13.884 --> 00:26:20.907]  Well, if you go to the Department of Health in the Philippines, it states back in 2012 that they actually eradicated the disease.
[00:26:21.187 --> 00:26:24.428]  They only had 60 cases in 2012 in the entire country.
[00:26:24.988 --> 00:26:26.909]  And they said that means it's been eradicated.
[00:26:27.889 --> 00:26:33.011]  So how does two years later they have a large outbreak that then transfers over to the United States?
[00:26:33.151 --> 00:26:35.412]  It's because the vaccines are causing the disease.
[00:26:36.263 --> 00:26:37.644]  And wait, I'm not through.
[00:26:37.664 --> 00:26:50.495]  And this is out of Eurosurveillance, Volume 18, Issue 49, dated December 5, 2013, titled, Case of Vaccine-Associated Measles, Five Weeks Post-Immunization, British Columbia, Canada, October 2013.
[00:26:51.255 --> 00:27:02.445]  And they actually describe in here a case that's documented at least three different times of a two-year-old baby who got the measles just 37 days after receiving the immunization.
[00:27:03.732 --> 00:27:04.672]  How does that happen?
[00:27:05.033 --> 00:27:09.915]  It happens because they're injecting the live virus into the person and then the person gets the disease.
[00:27:10.215 --> 00:27:19.520]  And you've seen past reports from myself and Alex talking about how in the insert, the package insert, it actually says in three different places it can give you the measles.
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:32.705]  We described the case of a vaccine-associated measles in a two-year-old patient from British Columbia, Canada, in October 2013, who received her first dose of measles-containing vaccine 37 days prior to onset of prodermal symptoms.
[00:27:33.405 --> 00:27:39.388]  Identification of this delayed vaccine-associated case occurred in the context of an outbreak investigation of a measles cluster.
[00:27:40.448 --> 00:27:41.929]  And I want to end with this.
[00:27:43.629 --> 00:27:47.090]  This is from the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition dated in 2003.
[00:27:47.711 --> 00:27:50.392]  Changes in immune system are conditioned by nutrition.
[00:27:51.072 --> 00:28:03.337]  Undernutrition due to insufficient intake of energy and macronutrients and or due to deficiencies in specific micronutrients impairs the immune system, suppressing immune functions that are fundamental to host protection.
[00:28:03.857 --> 00:28:06.559]  That is the basic key to everything.
[00:28:07.439 --> 00:28:09.480]  You have to take care of your immune system.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.421]  Shots aren't going to help you.
[00:28:12.569 --> 00:28:16.753]  Exercise, that's going to help you a little bit, but you've got to eat the right stuff.
[00:28:16.773 --> 00:28:18.815]  You've got to put the right stuff into your body.
[00:28:18.875 --> 00:28:22.278]  The micronutrients, the macronutrients, the things that are good for you.
[00:28:22.498 --> 00:28:23.600]  You can't eat Twinkies.
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.942]  You can't eat Jell-O pudding pops.
[00:28:26.222 --> 00:28:27.804]  You can't eat crud out there.
[00:28:28.044 --> 00:28:31.127]  You have to put good stuff into your body to keep your immune system up.
[00:28:31.467 --> 00:28:33.149]  That is how you defeat these diseases.
[00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:35.931]  That is the only way to defeat these diseases.
[00:28:35.971 --> 00:28:41.337]  You can take all the shots in the world with all the toxic substances and all the live viruses and it isn't going to do a thing.
[00:28:41.657 --> 00:28:43.419]  This has been Rob Doo for InfoWars.com.

[00:29:09.332 --> 00:29:11.433]  Thank you for watching and thank you once again for your support.
[00:29:12.393 --> 00:29:19.579]  This is for all the people who say the science on vaccines is subtle and if you don't get one, we're going to force you.
[00:29:20.039 --> 00:29:31.529]  This is about a measles outbreak that you haven't heard about, but you need to because it flies in the face of all the statistics and information you're being given by the CDC and the media.
[00:29:32.169 --> 00:29:40.734]  In New York, in 2011, a 22-year-old woman who had been vaccinated twice not only got sick with the measles, but she transmitted it to four other people.
[00:29:41.134 --> 00:29:46.877]  Furthermore, half of the people who caught it from her had been vaccinated twice themselves.
[00:29:47.745 --> 00:29:53.210]  The other half didn't have vaccine records but they had signs in their blood that they had been vaccinated.
[00:29:53.770 --> 00:30:02.818]  Now this woman had 88 contacts and the CDC feverishly searched for all of them and found that no one other than those four had contracted the disease.
[00:30:03.178 --> 00:30:08.883]  In this New York 2011 outbreak, the MMR vaccine didn't provide 99% protection to the vaccinated.
[00:30:11.105 --> 00:30:15.408]  All of the victims of the measles outbreak had been vaccinated.
[00:30:15.748 --> 00:30:25.976]  In this Disney outbreak, the California Department of Health is still saying two doses of measles containing MMR vaccine are more than 99% effective in preventing measles.
[00:30:26.776 --> 00:30:41.821]  Even in this article from Science Magazine, talking about a fully vaccinated patient who transmitted the disease to four other vaccinated patients, they still can't help but repeat the 99% effective line that we're being sold by the CDC and the pharmaceutical industry.
[00:30:42.486 --> 00:30:51.172]  They said this was a rare vaccine failure, and they point out that you're not supposed to be contagious if injected with MMR.
[00:30:51.692 --> 00:30:57.316]  But the 2011 New York outbreak proved that vaccinated individuals can transmit measles.
[00:30:58.197 --> 00:31:01.519]  The CDC says that New York has a 90% vaccination rate.
[00:31:02.019 --> 00:31:10.165]  If we go with the CDC average, that would mean that nine people who were exposed to the vaccinated carrier were unvaccinated, yet didn't catch it.
[00:31:10.984 --> 00:31:11.404]  But wait!
[00:31:11.685 --> 00:31:16.110]  The CDC tells us that 90% of unvaccinated people who come in contact with measles will get it.
[00:31:16.811 --> 00:31:20.334]  No unvaccinated people got the measles in this New York outbreak.
[00:31:20.715 --> 00:31:26.942]  So, is the pharmaceutical industry and the CDC, are they overstating the efficacy of the vaccine?
[00:31:27.422 --> 00:31:29.985]  Well, as a matter of fact, two virologists who worked for Merck,
[00:31:30.686 --> 00:31:33.068]  Claimed that they were doing exactly that.
[00:31:33.628 --> 00:31:43.456]  Two virologists who worked for Merck, the largest manufacturer of MMR vaccines, accused the corporation of falsifying tests to overstate the vaccine's efficacy.
[00:31:43.956 --> 00:31:53.304]  They claimed that they witnessed firsthand the improper testing and data falsification that Merck engaged in to artificially inflate the vaccine's efficacy findings.
[00:31:53.664 --> 00:32:02.867]  And they said that that scheme caused the United States government to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for a vaccine that doesn't provide adequate immunization.
[00:32:03.347 --> 00:32:06.668]  So, are Big Pharma and the CDC lying to people?
[00:32:06.708 --> 00:32:08.568]  Are they overstating the efficacy of the vaccine?
[00:32:08.848 --> 00:32:14.150]  Are they telling you that you're protected, 99% protected, when in fact you aren't?
[00:32:14.983 --> 00:32:33.762]  They allege that Merck added animal antibodies to blood samples to achieve more favorable test results, although they knew that the human immune system would never produce such antibodies, and that the antibodies created a laboratory testing scenario that, quote, did not in any way correspond to, correlate with, or represent real life.
[00:32:34.062 --> 00:32:36.004]  So the FDA didn't look into this matter?
[00:32:36.044 --> 00:32:37.465]  They were satisfied with Merck's answer?
[00:32:38.366 --> 00:32:44.431]  Are we surprised that regulatory agencies and the government would be captured by those that they're supposed to watch?
[00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:46.952]  Of course, the DOJ did not look at it either.
[00:32:47.693 --> 00:32:50.035]  They haven't looked at quite a few things lately, have they?
[00:32:50.515 --> 00:33:00.563]  When the CDC buys $4 billion worth of vaccines in 2014 alone, and then sells these as well, does that kind of conflict of interest bother you?
[00:33:01.533 --> 00:33:07.417]  But it's not just this measles outbreak in 2011 in New York that the media doesn't want to talk about, strangely.
[00:33:07.897 --> 00:33:10.659]  There's another epidemic they don't want to talk about either.
[00:33:10.679 --> 00:33:11.560]  Autism.
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.901]  In the 1970s and 1980s, only about 1 out of every 2,000 children had autism.
[00:33:13.941 --> 00:33:14.762]  Last year, it was 1 in 68.
[00:33:14.802 --> 00:33:15.462]  That's a 2,900% increase.
[00:33:24.528 --> 00:33:27.590]  A 30% increase in just the last two years.
[00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:37.597]  Correlation is not causation, but there is a very strong correlation to the increased use of vaccines and the rise of autism.
[00:33:38.177 --> 00:33:46.443]  And if you look at autism in the Amish community, where they don't vaccinate, as one reporter did 10 years ago when the national rate at that time was just 1 in 150,
[00:33:48.624 --> 00:33:52.105]  In the Amish community, there were only three children with autism.
[00:33:52.565 --> 00:33:58.087]  One of those three children was a child that was adopted from China and had received all of her vaccinations in one day.
[00:33:58.567 --> 00:34:07.650]  The second child was perfectly normal before getting the vaccine, but exhibited autism symptoms immediately after vaccination, and of course, the autism has never gone away.
[00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:10.691]  There was no information about the third child and vaccines.
[00:34:11.391 --> 00:34:14.952]  On the other hand, the highest rate of autism in the country is in Utah.
[00:34:15.652 --> 00:34:22.716]  So we have two communities, one where vaccines are essentially shunned, and we see that autism is so rare that it's virtually non-existent, as it used to be in the United States.
[00:34:35.464 --> 00:34:43.993]  But another community where it is actively pushed by the leadership, we see that they have an even higher rate than the exploding autism rate in this country.
[00:34:44.713 --> 00:34:45.935]  And we have two outbreaks.
[00:34:46.795 --> 00:34:58.107]  One that exposes the ineffectiveness of vaccines is ignored by the media, while another one is used to blame the unvaccinated persons who catch it for the ineffectiveness of the vaccine.
[00:34:59.269 --> 00:35:03.012]  Look at the hatred and the scapegoating that's being promoted by the media.
[00:35:03.592 --> 00:35:07.575]  Forbes says measles can kill and we should sue parents who don't vaccinate.
[00:35:07.675 --> 00:35:13.240]  And on the left, Slate says parents who don't vaccinate their kids should not only be sued, but criminally charged.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:19.705]  The New York Times calls the outbreak unnecessary and says that opposition to vaccines is lunacy.
[00:35:20.345 --> 00:35:25.966]  And we're told that the anti-vaccine movement caused this Mickey Mouse measles outbreak, and it was the worst in 20 years.
[00:35:26.466 --> 00:35:31.167]  Well, you know, about 25 years ago, approximately 18,000 people were getting the measles each year.
[00:35:31.267 --> 00:35:34.248]  Yes, it can kill, but it's extremely rare.
[00:35:34.688 --> 00:35:41.189]  In the 1960s, before the measles vaccine, there were about 4 million measles cases each year, with about 400 deaths.
[00:35:41.609 --> 00:35:46.210]  Those deaths are a tragedy, but how many diseases have a 99.99% chance you won't die?
[00:35:49.051 --> 00:35:59.439]  Now, after 25 years of vaccines, the mortality rate increased by 10 to 20 times, but it was still less than half the number of deaths from insect bites and stings.
[00:35:59.839 --> 00:36:08.606]  With such a low mortality rate, why would this justify a medical tyranny of forced injections without consent, without information about the risks?
[00:36:09.451 --> 00:36:19.784]  The pharmaceutical industry that owns the media, that funds them with their continuous commercials, are pushing vaccines everywhere for every kind of condition, and now they want to make them mandatory.
[00:36:20.444 --> 00:36:28.694]  Just as people wanted health care and we got mandatory insurance, that isn't necessarily going to pay for your health care, but you're going to get it at an inflated rate.
[00:36:29.415 --> 00:36:48.359]  Understand that if you accept this mandatory vaccination without your informed consent, that when we do have a life-threatening disease, and measles is not it, but when we do have something like Ebola come to this country, they are going to be pushing a vaccine on you, and you're going to be the human guinea pig.
[00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:51.800]  And they're not even going to pretend that they've tested it.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:57.461]  But they will make billions of dollars selling it to the government that forces you to take it.
[00:36:58.021 --> 00:36:59.946]  From Four Wars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[00:37:08.371 --> 00:37:13.372]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:37:13.612 --> 00:37:19.713]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:37:19.913 --> 00:37:26.895]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:37:27.235 --> 00:37:37.077]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[00:37:37.737 --> 00:37:43.661]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:37:43.901 --> 00:37:48.504]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:37:48.744 --> 00:37:52.087]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:37:52.347 --> 00:37:53.948]  No needles, no injections.
[00:37:54.228 --> 00:37:55.689]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:37:55.869 --> 00:37:56.890]  Try it for yourself.
[00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:58.631]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[00:38:08.197 --> 00:38:15.282]  2015 is almost here, and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform your body the way you want it.
[00:38:15.523 --> 00:38:19.325]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[00:38:19.465 --> 00:38:25.570]  Make this year different by equipping yourself with Oxy Powder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:31.734]  Using super oxygenation, Oxy Powder, available through InfoWarsLife.com, gently cleanses the body.
[00:38:31.894 --> 00:38:39.838]  While you sleep with easy capsules, tens of thousands of individuals have used Oxy-Powder to cleanse their bodies and aid in their transformations.
[00:38:40.238 --> 00:38:45.541]  Even InfoWars Nightly News Director Rob Doo has been using Oxy-Powder with incredible success.
[00:38:45.861 --> 00:38:48.222]  Took it that first day, then I took it for six more days after that.
[00:38:48.382 --> 00:38:50.223]  Twelve pounds melted off in about a week.
[00:38:50.283 --> 00:38:50.844]  I'd say a week.
[00:38:51.004 --> 00:38:51.444]  Seven days.
[00:38:52.565 --> 00:38:53.626]  2015 can be different.
[00:38:53.746 --> 00:38:56.689]  Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:58.772]  Oxy-Powder flushes it out.
[00:38:59.172 --> 00:39:01.915]  Secure your Oxy-Powder at Infowarslife.com.
[00:39:02.155 --> 00:39:04.017]  That's Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:39:12.702 --> 00:39:17.786]  Over the years, many of our viewers have sent us in a document known as the Secret Covenant.
[00:39:18.287 --> 00:39:24.532]  Now, we can't prove the authenticity of this document, but it was sent to a website in 2002.
[00:39:24.612 --> 00:39:29.517]  That website is bankindex.com, and it was submitted by an unknown author.
[00:39:30.017 --> 00:39:43.560]  Now, we do feel that there is a very powerful message within it, so we've put together a presentation outlining this document, this secret covenant, and we've also spoken with an Illuminati expert, Mark Dice.
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:51.541]  He is the author of Inside the Illuminati, to get his take and see if this is an accurate summary of the elite's agenda.
[00:39:52.082 --> 00:39:53.482]  And we also want to know what you think.
[00:39:53.542 --> 00:39:55.142]  Leave your comments below.
[00:39:55.702 --> 00:39:58.383]  Is this a handbook for humanity's annihilation?
[00:39:59.577 --> 00:40:06.103]  Yeah, as far as the Secret Covenant is concerned, I mean, I don't think that it's an authentic, you know, insider revelation.
[00:40:06.164 --> 00:40:16.874]  It's conceptually fairly accurate, but, you know, is it a direct document or some direct information from an insider Illuminati source?
[00:40:17.354 --> 00:40:17.615]  No.
[00:40:17.635 --> 00:40:21.799]  It appears to be some sort of, you know, fan fiction or some sort of
[00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:33.466]  A well-meaning fabrication to illustrate the actual Illuminati's plans, which are quite clear in the document.
[00:40:33.546 --> 00:40:36.768]  And again, is it authentic in a factual sense?
[00:40:37.088 --> 00:40:37.328]  No.
[00:40:38.048 --> 00:40:41.270]  Conceptually, it is fairly accurate.
[00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:47.234]  But I think that for people to point to the Secret Covenant as an authentic piece of Illuminati evidence,
[00:40:48.254 --> 00:41:00.201]  It really does some damage when there's plenty of actual, real Illuminati evidence out there to show that there is this secret doctrine, this secret society, their secret plan, basically.
[00:41:00.241 --> 00:41:02.603]  I mean, it's leaked out into public view.
[00:41:02.643 --> 00:41:09.847]  We have David Rockefeller basically admitting it in his memoir that him and his family have been part of a secret covenant.
[00:41:09.907 --> 00:41:11.748]  We have been tracking the Bilderberg Group.
[00:41:12.388 --> 00:41:25.316]  For many years and now they've sort of had to come out of the shadows and admit that they do exist and There's still a lot of unanswered questions that they really can't answer because how is it that a group so powerful?
[00:41:26.637 --> 00:41:38.284]  In meeting with so many important people could just not make it into the news if there wasn't some sort of an agreement Amongst the editors of most major media to keep them out of the press.
[00:41:38.324 --> 00:41:39.205]  There's obviously a
[00:41:39.625 --> 00:42:04.916]  Not, I don't want to say a conspiracy, because that's sort of a negatively charged word, but there's obviously an agreement between the Bilderberg steering committee and most major mainstream media outlets to keep them out of the press, because certainly it's newsworthy, certainly it's interesting, but yet it still isn't covered, or if it is, it's always sprinkled with that conspiracy theory word.
[00:42:05.816 --> 00:42:14.062]  Of course, the Council on Foreign Relations, you know, sort of an Illuminati front group in today's modern age, manipulating our foreign policy.
[00:42:14.082 --> 00:42:20.246]  To somebody who's not familiar with it, it sounds like a committee in Congress, but in reality, it's a private think tank.
[00:42:20.686 --> 00:42:25.530]  As you know, many of the world's most powerful politicians and journalists are a part of this.
[00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:29.933]  And basically, this private Illuminati front group serves up their
[00:42:30.686 --> 00:42:39.558]  Foreign policy agenda on a silver platter to American politicians and the news media who then disseminate it to their underlings.
[00:42:39.978 --> 00:42:45.446]  And it sort of just works its way into the American Congress and into the press.
[00:42:45.606 --> 00:43:14.793]  So, there's plenty of real, solid, verifiable pieces of evidence about this secret agenda, that there is this, whatever you want to call them, this Illuminati, this secret establishment, an invisible empire, it doesn't matter really what it's called, you can narrow it down to a handful of organizations and a handful of individuals, and their agendas become clear and have been leaked out by various insiders throughout the years.
[00:43:15.427 --> 00:43:17.368]  If any terrorism comes, it's from this government.
[00:43:17.769 --> 00:43:41.586]  And if there was an outside threat, like a bin Laden, who was a known CIA asset in the 80s, running the Mujahideen War, and whose family builds all the military bases over in Saudi Arabia right now, and sits on the board of Iridium Satellite, and tell them, we know the government's planning terrorism, we know Oklahoma City and World Trade Center was terrorism, we know the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted to blow up airliners, Baltimore Sun, if you do it, we're going to blame you, because we know who's up to it.
[00:43:41.827 --> 00:43:44.849]  Or if you let some terrorist group do it, like the World Trade Center,
[00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:46.550]  We know who to blame.
[00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:48.372]  Allergic, it will be.
[00:43:48.392 --> 00:43:52.816]  So large, so vast, it will escape their perception.
[00:43:52.856 --> 00:44:00.082]  Those who will see it will be thought of as insane.
[00:44:08.311 --> 00:44:13.836]  We will create separate fronts to prevent them from seeing the connection between us.
[00:44:14.437 --> 00:44:19.481]  We will behave as if we are not connected to keep the illusion alive.
[00:44:19.902 --> 00:44:23.024]  If you wanted to run against Preston Bush, you should have run four years ago.
[00:44:23.064 --> 00:44:34.495]  The fate of China and the United States has become linked in a way far beyond what any of us could imagine.
[00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:38.436]  We are now facing a common challenge.
[00:44:39.819 --> 00:44:44.452]  And the challenge is how to build a world order.
[00:44:45.905 --> 00:44:50.086]  For the first time in history, on a global basis.
[00:44:50.606 --> 00:44:58.008]  Our goal would be accomplished one drop at a time, so as to never bring suspicion upon ourselves.
[00:44:58.589 --> 00:45:02.810]  This will also prevent them from seeing the changes as they occur.
[00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:07.271]  We will always stand above the relative field of their experience.
[00:45:07.931 --> 00:45:10.752]  For we know the secrets of the absolute.
[00:45:11.492 --> 00:45:16.574]  We will work together always and will remain bound by blood and secrecy.
[00:45:17.274 --> 00:45:21.616]  The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.
[00:45:22.556 --> 00:45:31.819]  And we are as a people, inherently and historically, opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings.
[00:45:32.879 --> 00:45:34.020]  We decided long ago
[00:45:35.029 --> 00:45:43.875]  That the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers... Those weapons of mass destruction have got to be somewhere.
[00:45:43.895 --> 00:45:45.476]  ...which are cited to justify it.
[00:45:45.916 --> 00:45:53.601]  Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions.
[00:45:54.682 --> 00:46:02.407]  Even today, there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it.
[00:46:03.564 --> 00:46:13.454]  And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning.
[00:46:14.284 --> 00:46:17.525]  To the very limits of official censorship and concealment.
[00:46:18.105 --> 00:46:21.026]  Death will come to he who speaks.
[00:46:21.946 --> 00:46:28.387]  We will keep their lifespan short and their minds weak while pretending to do the opposite.
[00:46:29.348 --> 00:46:36.349]  We will use our knowledge of science and technology in subtle ways so they will never see what is happening.
[00:46:36.869 --> 00:46:38.370]  We will use salt metals.
[00:46:39.551 --> 00:46:43.896]  Aging accelerators and sedatives in food and water.
[00:46:44.717 --> 00:46:46.299]  Also, in the air.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:51.305]  They will be blanketed by poisons everywhere they turn.
[00:46:52.267 --> 00:46:55.491]  The soft metals will cause them to lose their minds.
[00:46:56.031 --> 00:46:59.114]  We will promise to find a cure from our many fronts.
[00:46:59.594 --> 00:47:02.176]  Yet, we will feed them more poison.
[00:47:02.997 --> 00:47:04.618]  There aren't reasons to not get vaccinated.
[00:47:04.638 --> 00:47:06.299]  Are you telling parents you should get your kids vaccinated?
[00:47:06.319 --> 00:47:07.720]  You should get your kids vaccinated.
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:08.581]  It's good for them.
[00:47:08.701 --> 00:47:12.244]  The poisons will be absorbed through their skin and mouths.
[00:47:12.584 --> 00:47:15.966]  They will destroy their minds and reproductive systems.
[00:47:16.767 --> 00:47:23.453]  From all this, their children will be born dead, and we will conceal this information.
[00:47:23.873 --> 00:47:32.340]  The poisons will be hidden in everything that surrounds them, in what they drink, eat, breathe, and wear.
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:37.284]  We must be ingenious in dispensing the poisons, for they can see far.
[00:47:37.804 --> 00:47:44.170]  We will teach them that the poisons are good, with fun images and musical tones.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.021]  Those they look up to will help.
[00:47:47.922 --> 00:47:51.104]  We will enlist them to push our poisons.
[00:47:51.864 --> 00:47:56.287]  They will see our products being used in film and will grow accustomed to them.
[00:47:57.014 --> 00:47:57.555]  We're good to go.
[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:24.920]  We're good to go.
[00:48:50.396 --> 00:48:51.637]  We will give them more.
[00:48:52.238 --> 00:48:52.938]  Poison.
[00:48:53.258 --> 00:49:00.364]  We will focus their attention toward money and material goods, so they may never connect with their inner self.
[00:49:00.664 --> 00:49:02.826]  We will distract them with fornication.
[00:49:03.513 --> 00:49:11.580]  On Tuesday, Oregon State Police got a tip that a young woman had created a 17-minute porn video that ended up on PornHub.com.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:13.101]  Yeah, it's the buzz around campus.
[00:49:13.321 --> 00:49:19.626]  External pleasures and games, so they may never be one with the oneness of it all.
[00:49:20.547 --> 00:49:24.350]  Their minds will belong to us, and they will do as we say.
[00:49:25.239 --> 00:49:25.939]  They refuse?
[00:49:26.459 --> 00:49:31.840]  We shall find ways to implement mind-altering technology into their lives.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.021]  We will use fear as our weapon.
[00:49:35.421 --> 00:49:39.181]  We will establish their governments and establish opposites within.
[00:49:39.661 --> 00:49:41.382]  We will own both sides.
[00:49:41.882 --> 00:49:45.402]  We will always hide our objective, but carry out our plan.
[00:49:45.783 --> 00:49:50.903]  They will perform the labor for us, and we shall prosper from their toil.
[00:49:51.764 --> 00:49:53.884]  Our families will never mix with theirs.
[00:49:55.776 --> 00:49:56.216]  We're good to go.
[00:50:11.847 --> 00:50:14.688]  And tell them what to think, and how.
[00:50:15.408 --> 00:50:22.230]  We will guide them, kindly and gently, letting them think they are guiding themselves.
[00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:29.952]  We will foment animosity between men and our factions, when a light shall shine among them.
[00:50:30.812 --> 00:50:36.615]  We shall extinguish it by ridicule or death, whichever suits us best.
[00:50:36.775 --> 00:50:40.838]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[00:50:41.398 --> 00:50:46.941]  We will make them rip each other's hearts apart and kill their own children.
[00:50:47.341 --> 00:50:53.385]  We will accomplish this by using hate as our ally, anger as our friend.
[00:50:54.285 --> 00:51:02.207]  The hate will blind them totally, and never shall they see that from their conflicts, we emerge as their rulers.
[00:51:02.787 --> 00:51:05.227]  They will be busy killing each other.
[00:51:05.567 --> 00:51:11.409]  They will bathe in their own blood and kill their neighbors, for as long as we see fit.
[00:51:12.229 --> 00:51:15.570]  We will benefit greatly from this, for they will not see us.
[00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:17.490]  They cannot see us.
[00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:21.971]  We will continue to prosper from their wars and their death.
[00:51:22.931 --> 00:51:29.736]  We shall repeat this over and over until our ultimate goal is accomplished.
[00:51:30.176 --> 00:51:36.121]  We will continue to make them live in fear and anger through images and sounds.
[00:51:37.062 --> 00:51:40.284]  We will use all the tools we have to accomplish this.
[00:51:40.724 --> 00:51:43.686]  The tools will be provided by their labor.
[00:51:44.407 --> 00:51:47.129]  We will make them hate themselves and
[00:51:50.723 --> 00:51:51.784]  We're good to go.
[00:52:16.513 --> 00:52:17.473]  We're good to go.
[00:52:46.929 --> 00:52:52.733]  We will use our media to control the flow of information and their sentiment in our favor.
[00:52:53.213 --> 00:52:57.596]  When they shall rise up against us, we will crush them like insects.
[00:52:58.336 --> 00:52:59.957]  But they are less than that.
[00:53:00.498 --> 00:53:02.779]  They will be helpless to do anything.
[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:06.302]  For they will have no weapons.
[00:53:07.082 --> 00:53:10.163]  We will recruit some of their own to carry out our plans.
[00:53:10.483 --> 00:53:14.585]  We will promise them eternal life, but eternal life they will never have.
[00:53:14.945 --> 00:53:16.025]  They are not of us.
[00:53:16.945 --> 00:53:24.668]  The recruits will be called Initiates, and will be indoctrinated to believe false rites of passage to higher realms.
[00:53:25.168 --> 00:53:30.150]  Members of these groups will think they are one with us, never knowing the truth.
[00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:36.112]  They must never learn the truth, for they will turn against us, for their work
[00:53:43.129 --> 00:53:43.989]  We're good to go.
[00:54:12.293 --> 00:54:18.660]  So grand the illusion of freedom will be, that they will never know they are our slaves.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:24.826]  When all is in place, the reality we will have created for them will own them.
[00:54:25.206 --> 00:54:28.190]  This reality will be their prison.
[00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:31.413]  They will live in self-delusion.
[00:54:31.974 --> 00:54:36.660]  When our goal is accomplished, a new era of domination will begin.
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:40.304]  Their minds will be bound by their beliefs.
[00:54:40.744 --> 00:54:45.510]  The beliefs we have established from time immemorial.
[00:54:45.951 --> 00:54:48.774]  But if they ever find out they are ours.
[00:54:49.662 --> 00:54:54.067]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down!
[00:54:54.428 --> 00:54:56.630]  If you want them, come and take them!
[00:54:56.871 --> 00:54:58.132]  We shall perish them.
[00:54:58.793 --> 00:55:04.720]  This they must never know, if they ever find out that together...
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:06.441]  They can vanquish us.
[00:55:06.782 --> 00:55:08.103]  They will take action.
[00:55:08.463 --> 00:55:13.828]  They must never, ever find out what we have done.
[00:55:14.349 --> 00:55:17.692]  For if they do, we shall have no place to run.
[00:55:17.992 --> 00:55:22.557]  For it will be easy to see who we are once the veil has fallen.
[00:55:23.357 --> 00:55:25.960]  Our actions will have revealed who we are.
[00:55:28.508 --> 00:55:31.410]  And no person shall give us shelter.
[00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:39.734]  This covenant must never, ever be known to exist.
[00:55:40.775 --> 00:55:44.897]  It must never, ever be written or spoken of.
[00:55:45.518 --> 00:55:49.060]  For if it is, the consciousness it will spawn
[00:55:49.821 --> 00:55:50.541]  We're good to go.
[00:56:09.568 --> 00:56:12.231]  Like I said, it was a very powerful presentation.
[00:56:12.251 --> 00:56:16.114]  We want to thank Mark Dice, of course, for weighing in with his expertise.
[00:56:16.535 --> 00:56:20.098]  But be sure and share this video all through social media.
[00:56:20.518 --> 00:56:21.559]  Upload it to YouTube.
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.181]  Share it with your friends and family.
[00:56:23.481 --> 00:56:30.448]  Maybe it's difficult for you to articulate what the actual plans are of the elite, but this video will really help break it down.
[00:56:30.928 --> 00:56:46.625]  Even if we can't prove the authenticity of this document, it certainly seems to be a pretty accurate portrayal of the agenda of the New World Order and what's coming, so be sure to share it with your friends and find out if any part of the secret covenant rings true for them.
[00:56:47.466 --> 00:56:50.149]  That's it for this episode of the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:56:58.789 --> 00:57:04.571]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:57:05.031 --> 00:57:14.715]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:57:15.075 --> 00:57:18.837]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:57:19.378 --> 00:57:24.060]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:57:24.441 --> 00:57:30.664]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
