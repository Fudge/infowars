[00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:14.420]  Will Donald Trump sign the GOP pledge precluding a third-party run?
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:24.662]  According to a close associate, the GOP candidate intends to sign the loyalty pledge that would bind him to endorse the Republican nominee and would preclude him a third-party run.
[00:00:24.862 --> 00:00:35.525]  The Republican National Committee has made it clear that they want every candidate running for nomination to sign a pledge not to break off and run as a third-party candidate under any circumstances.
[00:00:35.965 --> 00:00:43.311]  The GOP is worried that third-party campaigns will jeopardize the party's chances against the eventual Democratic presidential candidate.
[00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:51.937]  And as he's currently the most popular candidate, the GOP is concerned that Donald Trump may break off from the pact, and he has repeatedly threatened to do so.
[00:00:51.957 --> 00:00:54.219]  We're looking for you to raise your hand now.
[00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:58.342]  Raise your hand now if you won't make that pledge tonight.
[00:01:00.803 --> 00:01:01.344]  Mr. Trump.
[00:01:05.905 --> 00:01:06.366]  Mr. Trump.
[00:01:07.147 --> 00:01:13.434]  Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul reminded everyone that it was Ross Perot who ended up giving us the first Clinton.
[00:01:13.795 --> 00:01:16.798]  And if Trump breaks off, he could give us another Clinton.
