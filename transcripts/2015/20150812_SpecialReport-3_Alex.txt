[00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:16.725]  John McCain, a one-man Hegelian dialectic in motion, playing both sides to successfully roll out 53 annual defense bills and blaze a trail of unchecked ties to ISIS leaders.
[00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:36.818]  Are we completely lost our sense of any moral caring and concern about thousands and thousands of people who are murdered, who are made refugees, who are dying as we speak, and the Secretary of State says that we should not light our hair on fire.
[00:00:37.218 --> 00:00:38.499]  Do we give a damn?
[00:00:40.077 --> 00:00:51.880]  About what's happening in the streets of Ramadi and the thousands of refugees and the people and innocent men, women and children that are dying and being executed and their bodies burned in the street?
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.861]  Everyone in the national security team recommended arming ISIS.
[00:00:57.561 --> 00:01:00.002]  And the president, by himself, turned it down.
[00:01:00.042 --> 00:01:03.402]  We've determined that Bashar Assad has killed about 100 to 150 people with chemical weapons.
[00:01:05.703 --> 00:01:13.488]  Seymour Hersh says Barack Obama refused to acknowledge the fact that the Al-Qaeda affiliated Al-Nusra Front was a suspect of the crime.
[00:01:13.708 --> 00:01:14.709]  They want to get Iran.
[00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.451]  To get Iran, they want to destabilize Syria.
[00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:18.732]  That's the whole point.
[00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:22.094]  And they're trying to find which method is going to work better.
[00:01:22.174 --> 00:01:25.376]  They decide they probably better invade with troops.
[00:01:25.496 --> 00:01:29.899]  And then the pretext is going to be Assad's a bad guy who uses chemical weapons.
[00:01:31.018 --> 00:01:37.494]  Now, if this cover story was created in 2012, or maybe before, and we're just playing it out today...
[00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:41.954]  This is obviously, you know, making the facts fit a lie.
[00:01:42.274 --> 00:01:45.376]  Now McCain has been roped in once again to ISIS.
[00:01:45.697 --> 00:01:52.201]  McCain responded on his official Twitter account remarking another nutty conspiracy theory from the Russian internet trolls.
[00:01:52.521 --> 00:01:55.243]  I'm very proud to be target of America's enemies.
[00:01:55.643 --> 00:02:04.729]  In a response to a staged ISIS beheading video which pro-Russian hackers claim was found on one of his staffers electronic devices.
[00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.294]  Pro-Moscow hacktivist outfit Cyber Burkitt released the video.
[00:02:09.534 --> 00:02:17.222]  Cyber Burkitt previously took credit for hacking NATO websites and obtaining correspondence from within the United States Embassy in Ukraine.
[00:02:17.442 --> 00:02:22.647]  The group insisted that the footage was hacked from a device belonging to one of McCain's assistants,
[00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:28.530]  During a trip to Ukraine last month, but there was no accompanying evidence for this claim.
[00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:39.395]  The video, replete with desert scenery, professional lighting and a director, appears to be the same video doled out to the masses through the propaganda arm of the Pentagon.
[00:02:39.595 --> 00:02:46.198]  Look at this video from Turkish media network Kanal D's highly successful TV show Valley of the Wolves.
[00:02:49.423 --> 00:02:54.348]  It shows the exact same setup as the recent beheading videos from ISIS.
[00:02:54.668 --> 00:02:57.311]  He followed up with a subsequent tweet in which he stated,
[00:03:04.938 --> 00:03:07.221]  Proud to be their number one adversary.
[00:03:07.461 --> 00:03:10.704]  But are we supposed to just look the other way, Mr. McCain?
[00:03:10.965 --> 00:03:18.112]  When you're a pictured meeting with the likes of Abdel Hakim Belhage, who's now the leader of ISIS forces in Libya.
[00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:26.982]  Belhage, who implemented the brutality of Sharia law in Libya and worked directly with US and NATO forces during the overthrow of Gaddafi.
[00:03:27.222 --> 00:03:41.724]  And let's be honest here, there's clear evidence in my judgment that the Libya consulate that was attacked on the 9-11 anniversary was very much involved in moving, you know, obtaining surface-to-air missiles and other arms from the Libyans and transferring it via the Turks to the rebels in Syria.
[00:03:42.505 --> 00:03:50.066]  I just don't think it's in our interest to be doing that sort of thing based on the fact, as you mentioned, Alex, that chances are pretty good this is all going to come back and bite us someday.
[00:03:50.106 --> 00:03:56.287]  Senator, how do we know that the arms that are going to the Syrian rebels are not going to get into the hands of ISIS?
[00:03:56.971 --> 00:04:05.514]  Because if we had people who were there to funnel it to the right people, and I know these people, and I know who they are, and I know how to do it, and so do other people.
[00:04:05.754 --> 00:04:10.595]  Do you have any comments about the arms deal from Benghazi getting into the hands of the Syrian rebels?
[00:04:11.856 --> 00:04:12.576]  That didn't happen.
[00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:14.437]  The 15,000 Stinger missiles?
[00:04:14.937 --> 00:04:15.757]  No, didn't happen.
[00:04:16.337 --> 00:04:16.897]  It didn't happen.
[00:04:17.117 --> 00:04:17.718]  It didn't happen.
[00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:18.918]  Why would you think such a thing?
[00:04:19.178 --> 00:04:29.941]  Pawns like Senator John McCain would have us believe that 2 plus 2 equals 5, that the sky isn't blue, as the stench of treason wafts through the halls of Congress.
[00:04:30.381 --> 00:04:30.901]  No, no, no.
[00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:33.782]  We're going to have a fight because it's patently false.
[00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:40.584]  This is the same Rand Paul that said we didn't want to have anything to do with anything to do in the Middle East, by the way.
[00:04:40.684 --> 00:04:42.624]  I don't want to get in a fight with him at all.
[00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:44.105]  But it's not true.
[00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:45.545]  I know these people.
[00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:48.326]  I'm in contact with them all the time.
[00:04:48.726 --> 00:05:02.696]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:05:02.997 --> 00:05:05.278]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:05:05.579 --> 00:05:15.286]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
