[00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:07.927]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:07.927 --> 00:00:09.507]  You want answers?
[00:00:09.507 --> 00:00:10.868]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:10.868 --> 00:00:15.249]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:20.770]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:21.930]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:31.552]  Welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this live, worldwide Thursday, the 7th day of May 2015, Global Transmission.
[00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:43.106]  If you just tuned in and you're watching us on television, you'll notice that the lights are basically off here in the studio.
[00:00:43.106 --> 00:00:49.074]  And I got into the studio about, I don't know, an hour ago or so and sat down here with the lights off.
[00:00:49.074 --> 00:00:50.556]  And I kind of like the way it looks.
[00:00:53.114 --> 00:00:57.822]  And then I was thinking, what's an allegory for what's happening in our world?
[00:00:57.822 --> 00:01:05.415]  Because here I am in the shadows, kind of like the globalist program for corporate world government has been in the shadows.
[00:01:07.506 --> 00:01:26.273]  But as more and more people understand the globalist system, the philosophy, the program, what makes them tick, what they're building, what they believe in, and as more of us investigate, it sheds more and more light, like slowly turning up the lights in a room.
[00:01:26.273 --> 00:01:29.514]  Now we can slowly fade up the lights, but historically sometimes
[00:01:30.828 --> 00:01:42.038]  In fact, a lot of the time, the light slowly, barely fades up, and then all of a sudden, explosively, the lights come on and the roaches try to scatter.
[00:01:43.598 --> 00:01:45.379]  And that's the point we've reached.
[00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:54.326]  I've had George Stephanopoulos' office call me to supposedly go on this week on ABC.
[00:01:54.326 --> 00:02:00.971]  They want to fly me out there, but in my experience with mainstream media, they fly you somewhere as a joke to make you sit there.
[00:02:00.971 --> 00:02:02.071]  ABC hasn't done that.
[00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:07.956]  Not with Nightline, not with The View and other shows I've been on, but CNN and Fox, I just will not do it.
[00:02:08.576 --> 00:02:09.897]  I don't know, I'm going to fly out to D.C.
[00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:11.398]  to be in the room with Stephanopoulos.
[00:02:11.398 --> 00:02:19.565]  I'm seeing about trying to do it via satellite or via fiber as they do most of it now.
[00:02:19.565 --> 00:02:22.927]  I'm not going to do it taped so they can edit it all up like CNN did.
[00:02:22.927 --> 00:02:25.029]  In fact, we have that clip coming up.
[00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:33.616]  We played part of it with David Dewhurst yesterday dealing with the military drills and Jade Helm and the huge firestorm and political awakening to that that's now taking place.
[00:02:35.353 --> 00:02:42.636]  But we didn't get to the part where they intro the piece and edit me down to like three seconds saying, looks like an invasion.
[00:02:42.636 --> 00:02:47.218]  When I never said there's an imminent, real invasion happening this summer.
[00:02:47.218 --> 00:02:49.379]  And I know I kept, you know, hammering on that.
[00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.620]  It's just, this is how they deceive their audience.
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.463]  There is an amazing article on Infowars.com that we republished in full for the New American Magazine.
[00:02:57.463 --> 00:03:00.144]  We normally just publish snippets and link to them.
[00:03:00.144 --> 00:03:03.826]  By Alex Newman, who really breaks down the mainstream media deception
[00:03:05.672 --> 00:03:07.152]  On Jade Helm.
[00:03:07.152 --> 00:03:09.553]  It's the best article out there, bar none.
[00:03:09.553 --> 00:03:13.394]  Establishment Press discredits itself with Jade Helm deceit.
[00:03:13.394 --> 00:03:19.036]  And I just want to commend Alex Newman for his scholarly research because he just goes over their lies blow by blow.
[00:03:19.036 --> 00:03:29.119]  He mentions an NPR piece that I happened to read a transcript of and mention on air, I think on Monday.
[00:03:30.236 --> 00:03:32.197]  That was so cartoonish.
[00:03:32.197 --> 00:03:35.417]  It's like, Alex Jones believes they're killing people at Walmart.
[00:03:35.417 --> 00:03:38.498]  And he also believes in this crazy thing.
[00:03:38.498 --> 00:03:39.839]  Just all this stuff I never said.
[00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:43.480]  And never even mentioning Jade Helm itself.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.980]  I mean, it's getting crazy.
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.281]  Where they just go, tinfoil, tinfoil, tinfoil.
[00:03:48.281 --> 00:03:52.562]  Everybody knows we've got illegal acid formature seizure going on and illegal NSA spying.
[00:03:52.562 --> 00:03:56.203]  Of course, back when I talked about 20 years ago, everybody didn't know.
[00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:59.484]  I'm not bragging, I'm just saying, how many times do we have to be right over and over again?
[00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:06.219]  And now they're just involved in desperate damage control.
[00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:07.380]  Everybody knows who's...
[00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:15.037]  Half awake that there's militarization of police, that there's a federalization, a globalization of police.
[00:04:15.037 --> 00:04:20.700]  No one is saying the military individually are bad, though the media keeps saying we've said that.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:29.525]  It's the military that doesn't want this civilian inmate labor camp, civil unrest, mass roundup, gun confiscation plan.
[00:04:29.525 --> 00:04:34.128]  And it's in hundreds of documents that we source and video of it happening!
[00:04:35.658 --> 00:04:38.361]  Not just in Katrina, but areas of California, you name it.
[00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:39.202]  Knock and talk.
[00:04:39.202 --> 00:04:42.245]  I mean, people know they're being lied to.
[00:04:42.245 --> 00:04:45.828]  Are folks overreacting to Jade Helm?
[00:04:45.828 --> 00:04:49.452]  No, not really, because it's just a flashpoint.
[00:04:49.452 --> 00:04:51.233]  It's a spark.
[00:04:51.233 --> 00:04:52.955]  It's a wake-up point.
[00:04:52.955 --> 00:04:55.658]  Fox News calls it a firestorm, and it is a firestorm.
[00:04:58.996 --> 00:04:59.857]  Texas Rep.
[00:04:59.857 --> 00:05:07.326]  Louie Gohmert is joining a long list of congressmen who are actually doing their job and addressing the concerns of their citizens.
[00:05:07.326 --> 00:05:12.872]  Gohmert says he understands the concerns Texans have about the upcoming Jade Helm exercise.
[00:05:12.872 --> 00:05:19.220]  The congressman took particular issue with the map's labeling of Republican-majority states as hostile.
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:33.613]  Gohmert called on the Pentagon to change the map, the names on the map, and said the tone of the exercise needs to be completely revamped so the federal government is not intentionally practicing war against its own states.
[00:05:33.613 --> 00:05:39.799]  Former Texas governor and potential presidential candidate Rick Perry has some different thoughts though.
[00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:42.522]  Perry said, it's okay to question your government.
[00:05:42.942 --> 00:05:45.286]  But the military is something else.
[00:05:45.286 --> 00:05:48.630]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:06:57.938 --> 00:07:02.061]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:05.723]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:07:05.723 --> 00:07:08.745]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:07:08.745 --> 00:07:15.949]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:20.052]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:07:20.052 --> 00:07:24.395]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:07:24.395 --> 00:07:30.319]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:34.182]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:07:34.182 --> 00:07:36.884]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:07:36.884 --> 00:07:38.385]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:07:38.385 --> 00:07:39.726]  It's time to take action.
[00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:41.347]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:08:10.247 --> 00:08:14.510]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:19.152]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:19.152 --> 00:08:24.196]  Thank you for joining us on this live Thursday, the 7th day of May 2015.
[00:08:24.196 --> 00:08:28.258]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:31.520]  We're going to be here, Lord willing, for the next three hours live.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.701]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:34.082 --> 00:08:43.247]  The globalists, the private corporate interests that control the issuance of currency and credit through private central banks, like our Federal Reserve, want to keep things in the dark.
[00:08:43.247 --> 00:08:47.810]  Well, InfoWars is here bringing light to the situation.
[00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:55.735]  And as the light begins to incrementally get turned up, the roaches are starting to scatter.
[00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:59.817]  And their monopoly of media is imploding.
[00:08:59.817 --> 00:09:02.379]  Again, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:09:04.719 --> 00:09:06.560]  Where to begin?
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:20.507]  Jade Helm is being called by Fox News, ABC News, the New York Times and others, a firestorm, an explosive political battle.
[00:09:20.507 --> 00:09:24.649]  It is now probably the top story in the country.
[00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:47.263]  And it's a huge victory for Liberty, because even though the mainstream media, the globalist sympathizer media, has framed all this in fraud, and made it all about an imminent takeover and martial law this summer, when we've talked about it being conditioning for incremental globalization and federalization.
[00:09:49.209 --> 00:09:58.955]  And the military's own legions of documents and training manuals admitting it's for the American people for future paramilitary civil unrest gun confiscation.
[00:09:58.955 --> 00:10:06.099]  I mean, that's in the Washington Times, Forbes, AP, Reuters, the Army War College.
[00:10:06.099 --> 00:10:09.721]  We've made countless videos about it showing anybody can search those terms.
[00:10:11.181 --> 00:10:14.143]  How the Pentagon would crush a Tea Party rebellion.
[00:10:14.143 --> 00:10:15.664]  You'll get the headlines.
[00:10:15.664 --> 00:10:19.447]  And then you'll get the actual Army manuals.
[00:10:19.447 --> 00:10:23.509]  That's why the military is so awake now.
[00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:31.355]  Because they're there, the non-commissioned officers and up, are being given treasonous training.
[00:10:31.355 --> 00:10:35.578]  It was in the news two weeks ago again.
[00:10:35.578 --> 00:10:40.161]  Army and Armed Services-wide, but the leak was out of the Army.
[00:10:42.622 --> 00:10:44.163]  It wasn't even a leak, it was just public.
[00:10:44.163 --> 00:10:50.265]  But the folks in the military are the ones that leaked it onto the web and said, look what we're being taught.
[00:10:50.265 --> 00:11:00.109]  Where they said the founding fathers were bad and that free market's bad and racist and sexist and the founders are evil.
[00:11:00.109 --> 00:11:04.330]  A federal judge ruled a month ago that you can't wear an American flag if people think it's offensive.
[00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.851]  This is Twilight Zone behavior.
[00:11:06.851 --> 00:11:11.713]  They're blaming the victims of the terrorist attack in Garland in the media
[00:11:13.032 --> 00:11:24.554]  For their speech eliciting these folks, and then some of the Twitter accounts criticizing the dead terrorists are getting censored for being insensitive.
[00:11:24.554 --> 00:11:31.996]  And then on Fox News, they've got an imam on saying that basically the people that put on this show deserve to be killed.
[00:11:31.996 --> 00:11:34.996]  And Sean Hannity says, well, you know, we don't follow your laws here.
[00:11:34.996 --> 00:11:36.816]  In fact, just get that clip ready.
[00:11:36.816 --> 00:11:38.117]  You know, we've got the Constitution.
[00:11:38.117 --> 00:11:39.157]  He says, not for long.
[00:11:40.356 --> 00:11:45.260]  And I'm not in some clash of civilizations, Islamophobic, hatred of Muslims, period.
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:52.645]  Everybody knows I'm against destabilizing the Middle East, what happened in Iraq, aiding Al-Qaeda to destabilize Syria, overthrowing Egypt.
[00:11:52.645 --> 00:11:55.087]  I want prosperity and freedom for the Middle East.
[00:11:55.087 --> 00:11:57.829]  And there are a lot of moderate Muslims.
[00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:58.429]  And good people.
[00:11:59.995 --> 00:12:04.920]  Our government, our media allows, and the same thing in England, radicals to operate.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.001]  In fact, here's the shock video.
[00:12:07.001 --> 00:12:12.146]  Radical Imam tells Pamela Geller on live TV she should be killed.
[00:12:12.146 --> 00:12:14.868]  Here's that clip.
[00:12:14.868 --> 00:12:15.349]  And then we'll...
[00:12:16.892 --> 00:12:18.113]  Continue on with...
[00:12:34.227 --> 00:12:37.349]  And see how this is going to work with political correctness.
[00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:09.491]  is you can't have speech if it inflames this extremist.
[00:13:09.491 --> 00:13:16.113]  And by the way, the Wahhabists are running around blowing up every Christian shrine they can find.
[00:13:16.113 --> 00:13:21.194]  The shrine of Jonah, the shrine of Christ.
[00:13:21.194 --> 00:13:23.195]  It's just pure bull.
[00:13:23.195 --> 00:13:24.835]  And it's like gang culture.
[00:13:24.835 --> 00:13:33.958]  The worst radical Muslims with Saudi Arabian funding bully everyone else into following their sick brand of cultic oppression.
[00:13:35.305 --> 00:13:37.026]  And I'm against totalitarianism.
[00:13:37.026 --> 00:13:38.587]  I don't care where it comes from.
[00:13:38.587 --> 00:13:41.409]  Communist, Nazi, radical jihadi.
[00:13:41.409 --> 00:13:45.432]  I'm sick of it.
[00:13:45.432 --> 00:13:51.336]  And I'm sick of the left's bizarre alliance with radical Islam.
[00:13:54.352 --> 00:13:55.512]  We're going to get into that.
[00:13:55.512 --> 00:14:01.114]  And ISIS claims it has 71 trained soldiers in 15 different states ready to attack.
[00:14:01.114 --> 00:14:03.015]  That's on InfoWars.com.
[00:14:03.015 --> 00:14:05.896]  ISIS targeting states with strict gun control laws.
[00:14:05.896 --> 00:14:06.736]  InfoWars.com.
[00:14:06.736 --> 00:14:08.317]  We're going to break that down.
[00:14:08.317 --> 00:14:11.858]  ISIS says more attacks imminent in US.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.882]  Says the two killed in Dallas by an off duty police officer where they're soldiers.
[00:14:17.882 --> 00:14:21.163]  Obama's set to begin training jihadists in Syria.
[00:14:21.163 --> 00:14:30.026]  Actual ISIS are being trained now in Syria as we predicted they would do to launch phase two with them now resupplied out of Iraq with U.S.
[00:14:30.026 --> 00:14:31.766]  weapons.
[00:14:31.766 --> 00:14:36.068]  And all this had to be done because the military caught on to what was happening two years ago and said no.
[00:14:36.068 --> 00:14:40.129]  So now they just let them resupply by invading Iraq and having our military stand down.
[00:14:42.017 --> 00:14:43.698]  Can't make that up.
[00:14:43.698 --> 00:14:50.081]  ISIS opens a 262-room luxury hotel in Mosul, in Iraq's second-largest city.
[00:14:50.081 --> 00:14:52.402]  And of course, no one's going to bomb it.
[00:14:52.402 --> 00:14:54.143]  Because it's a shadow army.
[00:14:54.143 --> 00:14:58.726]  Huckabee slams Obama for stripping grandmothers, while known terrorists tweet they're going to attack.
[00:14:58.726 --> 00:15:00.347]  He calls for scrapping the TSA.
[00:15:00.347 --> 00:15:02.488]  I actually like that.
[00:15:02.488 --> 00:15:05.169]  That makes sense of what Huckabee's saying.
[00:15:05.169 --> 00:15:08.651]  The New York Times loves blasphemy, except when it targets Muslims.
[00:15:11.138 --> 00:15:12.599]  Now I want to be clear about this.
[00:15:12.599 --> 00:15:20.924]  I'm the guy that is most credited with exposing the fact that 9-11, as we were told it happened, was a fable.
[00:15:20.924 --> 00:15:24.606]  And that our government basically stood down bare minimum.
[00:15:24.606 --> 00:15:32.871]  And that most of the Al-Qaeda force was Western intelligence cutouts, corporate cutouts, as a pretext to invade countries that were innocent like Iraq.
[00:15:32.871 --> 00:15:34.772]  And to take control of opium in Afghanistan.
[00:15:34.772 --> 00:15:36.293]  That's all been borne out and proven accurate.
[00:15:38.843 --> 00:15:45.050]  I get a lot of criticism from people explaining to me what false flags are and what provocateurs are and things like that.
[00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.733]  That's like explaining to Babe Ruth how to hit a home run.
[00:15:47.733 --> 00:15:48.874]  Okay, fine.
[00:15:48.874 --> 00:15:51.036]  Or it's like telling me the Federal Reserve's private.
[00:15:51.036 --> 00:15:51.897]  Gee, I didn't know that.
[00:15:51.897 --> 00:15:55.401]  Or, you know, that Barack Obama's a big fat liar and so is Hillary.
[00:15:55.401 --> 00:15:59.646]  I mean, the ISIS is a completely different operation.
[00:16:00.816 --> 00:16:06.939]  Hitler wasn't under the control of some of the robber barons in England and the United States.
[00:16:06.939 --> 00:16:17.304]  He was funded, and wound up, and had peace treaties with England that had been declassified, and was told he was going to be allowed to invade Europe and take over, and that later he would link up with the U.S.
[00:16:17.304 --> 00:16:20.426]  and England.
[00:16:20.426 --> 00:16:26.449]  That's why he allowed the British to evacuate France when he first invaded France.
[00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:28.910]  This is all mainline history.
[00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.331]  You gotta dig a little deeper, but it's there.
[00:16:31.348 --> 00:16:33.949]  It's the same thing here.
[00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:37.429]  ISIS is the Syrian, Free Syrian Army.
[00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:42.191]  Funded for five years, six billion dollars at least we know about from Congress.
[00:16:42.191 --> 00:16:46.412]  They are Wahhabis, they are Saudi Arabia funded, they're recruiting all over the world.
[00:16:46.412 --> 00:16:51.033]  The West allows them to fly in and out of our countries.
[00:16:51.033 --> 00:16:56.454]  And then they march around with people at May Day parades in Austin and other areas.
[00:16:58.197 --> 00:16:59.558]  I see the ISIS signs.
[00:16:59.558 --> 00:17:00.759]  I see it online.
[00:17:00.759 --> 00:17:07.664]  I recognize genuine grassroots recruiting versus projections and fake garbage.
[00:17:07.664 --> 00:17:09.826]  So this is two different animals.
[00:17:09.826 --> 00:17:16.231]  Does that mean that some agency or group in an agency, rogue group, might not stage terror attacks and blame it on ISIS?
[00:17:16.231 --> 00:17:22.535]  Does that mean that there aren't ISIS leaders being basically run by Western globalist organizations?
[00:17:22.535 --> 00:17:23.196]  No, that's come out.
[00:17:24.525 --> 00:17:33.229]  But the grassroots and their camp followers and their bots, as Colonel Schaefer called them, are real.
[00:17:33.229 --> 00:17:37.651]  They're real.
[00:17:37.651 --> 00:17:44.434]  And the border is wide open, and so undoubtedly there are going to be some attacks.
[00:17:47.076 --> 00:17:56.925]  They've been picking up thousands a month of other than Mexicans, is what it's called in the sheets, the forms filled out by the Border Patrol, at one border sector in Texas alone.
[00:17:56.925 --> 00:18:00.028]  I mean, look it up, we've done whole stories on it.
[00:18:00.028 --> 00:18:12.620]  So, there are people pouring across, like the guy who's allowed to broadcast in England, and call for people's death, and the government leaves him on air because, you know, Michael Savage can't go to England, but emoms can get on TV and call for killing people, basically.
[00:18:14.639 --> 00:18:23.808]  Because this is how they're bringing in political correctness, saying, oh, all these minority groups can say whatever they want, you just can't.
[00:18:23.808 --> 00:18:38.182]  And so if people like this are out there preaching at madrasas all over the Western world, and then they can come into the United States, you better believe that we're going to see things like this unfold.
[00:18:40.796 --> 00:18:43.057]  There's our report from last year with John Bowne.
[00:18:43.057 --> 00:18:47.258]  Illegals from all over the world crossing the border.
[00:18:47.258 --> 00:18:54.461]  And Bowne was out there talking to retired Border Patrol agents and ranchers and others about the situation.
[00:18:54.461 --> 00:18:58.042]  So what we're pointing out is this whole war on terror is a hoax.
[00:18:58.042 --> 00:18:59.443]  It is a fraud.
[00:18:59.443 --> 00:19:09.066]  We had a 15 year war that cost trillions of dollars and now we're told that the Al Qaeda slash ISIS threat is 10 times bigger than it ever was and prepare for imminent attack.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.303]  Now, I'm not going to get into that more until later.
[00:19:13.303 --> 00:19:16.628]  I want to come back and give you the good news on Jade Helm.
[00:19:16.628 --> 00:19:18.671]  This is a firestorm of awakening.
[00:19:20.217 --> 00:19:49.503]  And no matter how they misphrase things and put words in our mouths that we hate the military or that we say Obama's gonna, you know, occupy the State House and all the rest of it, this is part of an incremental globalization through the federal government and that's why we said it should be looked at because in many other military training drills they prepare, we have the video of the training drills and the police admitting working with them, that they're preparing for war with veterans, gun owners, Christians and that's what this is all about.
[00:19:50.163 --> 00:19:58.367]  And the fact that people are so upset shows they've reached their political breaking point, and they don't have any faith in the corrupt people that have hijacked the government.
[00:19:58.367 --> 00:20:01.769]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:20:02.572 --> 00:20:03.192]  It's true.
[00:20:03.192 --> 00:20:07.334]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:20:07.334 --> 00:20:09.736]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:20:09.736 --> 00:20:14.518]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[00:20:14.518 --> 00:20:21.882]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA.
[00:20:22.202 --> 00:20:27.386]  Pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[00:20:27.386 --> 00:20:31.189]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:33.831]  The gold standard in water purification.
[00:20:33.831 --> 00:20:38.154]  And our filters last for years at less than two cents per gallon.
[00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:42.437]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[00:20:58.107 --> 00:21:00.049]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[00:21:00.049 --> 00:21:03.672]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[00:21:03.672 --> 00:21:05.033]  A pair of scissors.
[00:21:05.033 --> 00:21:10.818]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[00:21:10.818 --> 00:21:15.742]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[00:21:15.742 --> 00:21:16.723]  The phone line.
[00:21:16.723 --> 00:21:21.988]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[00:21:21.988 --> 00:21:25.731]  But, a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[00:21:25.891 --> 00:21:29.195]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[00:21:29.195 --> 00:21:31.658]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[00:21:31.658 --> 00:21:36.023]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.

[00:21:58.538 --> 00:21:59.098]  Good, brother.
[00:21:59.098 --> 00:22:01.059]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:22:01.059 --> 00:22:02.780]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.822]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:22:06.822 --> 00:22:07.562]  Well, thank you, brother.
[00:22:07.562 --> 00:22:11.845]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:22:11.845 --> 00:22:19.809]  Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:19.969 --> 00:22:23.253]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:22:23.253 --> 00:22:24.795]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:22:24.795 --> 00:22:27.718]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:22:27.718 --> 00:22:29.480]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:34.906]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[00:22:34.966 --> 00:22:35.686]  We're good to go.
[00:22:57.327 --> 00:23:01.150]  Last year, in the Nevada desert, one family took a stand for freedom.
[00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:05.654]  Numana Food Storage was the first and only company to support the rights of the Bundys.
[00:23:05.654 --> 00:23:12.099]  While others stood down, Numana took donations and provided storable foods to the men at Bunkerville.
[00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:19.104]  Founded by patriots who believe in liberty, Numana Food Storage is GMO-free, great tasting, and easy to prepare.

[00:23:55.176 --> 00:23:56.056]  Come and take it.
[00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:05.435]  The devil went down to Georgia.
[00:24:05.435 --> 00:24:08.525]  He was looking for a soul stealer.
[00:24:08.525 --> 00:24:09.228]  He was in a box.
[00:24:09.228 --> 00:24:09.950]  He was way behind.
[00:24:14.406 --> 00:24:15.847]  The devil went down to Georgia.
[00:24:15.847 --> 00:24:17.328]  He was looking for a soul to steal.
[00:24:17.328 --> 00:24:19.990]  Charlie Daniels, the listener of the show.
[00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:22.112]  He writes articles fighting the globalists.
[00:24:22.112 --> 00:24:24.374]  He's been writing about the TPP.
[00:24:24.374 --> 00:24:37.904]  America having basically everything from its trade to its military to its free speech being transferred to a secret global board headed up by Chinese communist executives.
[00:24:37.904 --> 00:24:39.706]  You cannot make that up.
[00:24:41.846 --> 00:24:42.606]  Yep.
[00:24:42.606 --> 00:24:44.127]  The devil went down to Georgia.
[00:24:44.127 --> 00:24:45.988]  He was looking for a soul to steal.
[00:24:45.988 --> 00:24:46.808]  He was in a box.
[00:24:46.808 --> 00:24:47.368]  He was way behind.
[00:24:47.368 --> 00:24:48.629]  He was willing to make a deal.
[00:24:48.629 --> 00:24:56.752]  And we're not privy to those deals because we're not stakeholders, to quote David Knight yesterday, quoting what they have to say.
[00:24:56.752 --> 00:24:57.633]  Sorry, Congress.
[00:24:57.633 --> 00:24:59.053]  You can't see it.
[00:24:59.053 --> 00:25:00.214]  Not a stakeholder.
[00:25:00.214 --> 00:25:02.715]  You're just the elected representatives of the people.
[00:25:02.715 --> 00:25:04.556]  Oh, everything's fine.
[00:25:04.556 --> 00:25:06.236]  Nothing's going on.
[00:25:06.236 --> 00:25:07.297]  Nothing's wrong.
[00:25:09.676 --> 00:25:14.080]  You know what the good news is, before I get into Jade Helm and epic information?
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:20.045]  NSA phone data collection, illegal appeals court rules, the New York Times.
[00:25:20.045 --> 00:25:22.987]  And I love these two shooters up in Garland.
[00:25:22.987 --> 00:25:31.054]  I love how they tweeted six hours before they were going to go kill people and talked about this event and other tweets.
[00:25:31.054 --> 00:25:36.239]  Any moron could, the FBI was watching them and had arrested them but were ordered to release them.
[00:25:40.953 --> 00:25:48.917]  Just like 9-11, and the NSA didn't protect us, did it?
[00:25:48.917 --> 00:26:03.424]  No, an off-duty cop who knew there was a SWAT team inside guarding the people, was supportive of the First Amendment, was a smart guy, and thought, gee, they keep attacking these almost every time they have one in Europe.
[00:26:03.424 --> 00:26:05.045]  Maybe I should go stake it out.
[00:26:07.355 --> 00:26:08.976]  He didn't go hunting white tail deer.
[00:26:08.976 --> 00:26:13.940]  He went and was hunting prison scum.
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.562]  I'm not saying everybody in prison is scum.
[00:26:15.562 --> 00:26:19.345]  A lot of people are innocent or in there for, but I mean these guys are, we're scum.
[00:26:23.456 --> 00:26:28.559]  We're going to get into that NSA situation though, but I thought the NSA wasn't spying with keywords?
[00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:33.242]  Yesterday I saw a Time Magazine article explaining how they record everything and then use keywords.
[00:26:33.242 --> 00:26:39.666]  Oh my gosh, that's only been known for like 30 years since James Bamford, the producer of Nightline, exposed it.
[00:26:42.256 --> 00:26:47.778]  I used to go on the radio and play clips of Nightline episodes from like 25, 30 years ago, and people thought they were fake.
[00:26:47.778 --> 00:26:50.939]  And we'd go, there's no NSA, it doesn't even exist.
[00:26:50.939 --> 00:26:55.341]  It's this culture of total denial.
[00:26:55.341 --> 00:26:56.682]  But I'll tell you what's exciting.
[00:26:56.682 --> 00:26:58.502]  People now don't deny this stuff.
[00:26:58.502 --> 00:27:00.263]  Mainstream media tries to deny it.
[00:27:00.263 --> 00:27:07.746]  Dying dinosaur media tries to, but Chuck Norris has come out with a very powerful article yesterday in WorldNetDaily.
[00:27:09.923 --> 00:27:11.103]  And he's Mr. Military.
[00:27:11.103 --> 00:27:15.105]  Military just loves Chuck Norris.
[00:27:15.105 --> 00:27:16.726]  In fact, I'm not bragging.
[00:27:16.726 --> 00:27:17.446]  It's just true.
[00:27:17.446 --> 00:27:19.127]  In fact, it's a great responsibility.
[00:27:19.127 --> 00:27:26.550]  It makes me feel incredibly humble and pathetic that we are the number one show now by every metric listened to by the U.S.
[00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:27.490]  Armed Services.
[00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:29.391]  Because they know I know what I'm talking about.
[00:27:29.391 --> 00:27:31.332]  They want to be decompartmentalized.
[00:27:31.332 --> 00:27:33.132]  I was talking to a media analyst last night.
[00:27:33.132 --> 00:27:39.595]  He said, Alex, you know, not just for the military, but for the establishment itself, your show is like porn to them.
[00:27:41.021 --> 00:27:44.322]  They're sick of watching all the lies and twisting in mainstream media.
[00:27:44.322 --> 00:27:50.125]  Even when people in the system are for something, they love to hear about it from your perspective.
[00:27:50.125 --> 00:27:52.045]  So it's not that I'm even that special.
[00:27:52.045 --> 00:27:56.527]  It's just that nobody else will just tell it like it is.
[00:27:56.527 --> 00:27:57.627]  And it's not my perspective.
[00:27:57.627 --> 00:28:00.669]  I've been reading what the globalists have to say forever.
[00:28:00.669 --> 00:28:02.830]  I've been watching their program progress.
[00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:08.032]  I've watched them do it faster and slower and in different ways in other countries.
[00:28:08.032 --> 00:28:08.952]  I'm obsessed with it.
[00:28:11.502 --> 00:28:16.623]  And I didn't have to steal their playbooks like the New England Patriots are known to do.
[00:28:16.623 --> 00:28:24.086]  Their playbooks are public because they have disdain and arrogance for the people.
[00:28:24.086 --> 00:28:31.428]  So you can differ with me on my interpretations of things, but you can't differ with me that the Pentagon says their main mission is gun owners and veterans.
[00:28:31.428 --> 00:28:39.550]  I mean, that is so legendarily evil and such a giant red flag that it should have everyone completely freaking out.
[00:28:40.734 --> 00:28:43.496]  And the good news is we finally are getting out of the trance.
[00:28:43.496 --> 00:28:44.937]  We're finally getting upset.
[00:28:44.937 --> 00:28:46.879]  Does it mean people know everything about Jade Helm?
[00:28:46.879 --> 00:28:48.440]  Does it mean it's a takeover?
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.221]  Probably not, 98%.
[00:28:49.221 --> 00:28:52.463]  It's part of an incremental takeover.
[00:28:52.463 --> 00:28:55.606]  And is the public overreacting in some ways?
[00:28:55.606 --> 00:28:56.186]  Yeah.
[00:28:56.186 --> 00:29:08.656]  But they've been underreacting to all the incredible off-the-chart gun confiscation in Katrina, an asset forfeiture seizure, and executive open borders, and a hundred other insane things.
[00:29:10.413 --> 00:29:16.140]  Google watching people with their cameras and Samsung saying we're listening to you over the TV.
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:18.243]  I mean this is all cuckoo level.
[00:29:21.733 --> 00:29:27.298]  So, if people are now freaking out, and the media is trying to spin it like, oh, we're nuts, no!
[00:29:27.298 --> 00:29:30.160]  We're finally acting like normal humans.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:36.646]  When we come back, incredible quotes from Chuck Norris, amazing quotes from Texas Louie Gohmert, a congressman.
[00:29:36.646 --> 00:29:38.567]  I'm really proud of Texas.
[00:29:38.567 --> 00:29:39.948]  Texans don't want to be slaves.
[00:29:39.948 --> 00:29:41.290]  We've got a lot of faults.
[00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:43.391]  But at the end of the day, we're free people.
[00:29:43.391 --> 00:29:46.294]  And we will never submit to the globalists, and they know that.
[00:29:46.294 --> 00:29:47.515]  That's why they're training to take over.
[00:29:48.035 --> 00:29:51.045]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.045 --> 00:29:54.636]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.894 --> 00:30:07.917]  The big problem with renewable energy like solar and wind is that it varies widely in output, and there's no effective way to store the energy for ready availability.
[00:30:07.917 --> 00:30:13.678]  That's why Elon Musk's Tesla has generated so much buzz about their Powerwall battery system.
[00:30:13.678 --> 00:30:25.782]  While the total cost of Powerwall is still about three times the cost of power from the grid, if it can achieve an economy of scale with large commercial users, it could radically change power and allow people to get off the grid.
[00:30:25.782 --> 00:30:28.583]  But another technology from Audi may be even far more
[00:30:29.443 --> 00:30:39.467]  Audi has refined a process from the 1920s that allows them to use renewable energy like solar to create a clean synthetic diesel fuel from water and CO2.
[00:30:39.467 --> 00:30:42.128]  They say it has no sulfur and burns cleanly.
[00:30:42.128 --> 00:30:48.390]  But what I like most about it is that it consumes CO2, the boogeyman of the climate alarmists.
[00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:52.472]  And it short-circuits the schemes of carbon pimps like Al Gore.
[00:30:52.472 --> 00:30:56.133]  I'm David Knight for InfoWars Nightly News and Prison Planet TV.
[00:30:58.613 --> 00:31:01.256]  InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:31:11.125 --> 00:31:18.211]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[00:31:18.291 --> 00:31:18.911]  We're good to go.
[00:31:39.039 --> 00:31:39.579]  We're good.

[00:32:14.481 --> 00:32:18.043]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[00:32:53.106 --> 00:32:54.107]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:10.097 --> 00:33:33.470]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:35.191]  It is Thursday, my friends.
[00:33:35.191 --> 00:33:36.532]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:33:40.313 --> 00:33:44.054]  Coming up, I've got Ron Finley on.
[00:33:44.054 --> 00:33:49.556]  He's an urban farmer and has been part of TED Talk, you name it.
[00:33:49.556 --> 00:34:00.660]  He's gotten in trouble, been fined, I guess he's been arrested from when I was reading, for daring to plant gardens in just green spaces like on the side of the highway and stuff.
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.641]  Because there's no bigger crime than actually
[00:34:05.188 --> 00:34:09.012]  Doing things like that outside of the big mega box stores.
[00:34:09.012 --> 00:34:13.235]  You're not supposed to do that and teach communities how to produce their own food and how much fun it is.
[00:34:13.235 --> 00:34:16.258]  So you need to be persecuted for it.
[00:34:16.258 --> 00:34:20.222]  He's going to be joining us for about 30 minutes in the second hour.
[00:34:20.222 --> 00:34:25.307]  Then we'll open the phones up for the balance of the transmission and we have some special reports coming up.
[00:34:25.307 --> 00:34:26.908]  I want to get to the Clinton Foundation.
[00:34:26.908 --> 00:34:28.810]  Everybody keeps asking me why I'm not covering it.
[00:34:30.387 --> 00:34:35.732]  We've been covering the Clinton Foundation for 10 years.
[00:34:35.732 --> 00:34:38.874]  The Bushes are involved in it.
[00:34:38.874 --> 00:34:42.677]  Half the money goes to pay for private jets and mansions.
[00:34:42.677 --> 00:34:46.080]  And the other half goes to buy political influence in countries.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:50.064]  Basically, almost none of the money goes to little Haitians and things like that, little starving kids.
[00:34:51.749 --> 00:34:57.813]  But let's just get to it now, and then Bill Clinton has little flippant comments about, oh, there's a big conspiracy.
[00:34:57.813 --> 00:35:05.057]  See, anytime you point out that he's got foreign donors giving him illegal money, according to federal law, or that they're keeping the money, I mean, these are facts.
[00:35:05.057 --> 00:35:14.944]  It's like Bono, part of the UN charity, it turned out, was giving 2% of the proceeds of the millions he was raising in every event.
[00:35:14.944 --> 00:35:18.426]  He was keeping the money for himself.
[00:35:20.427 --> 00:35:25.331]  I mean, if you have a charity and give 70%, that's fine, because you've got overhead.
[00:35:25.331 --> 00:35:28.933]  There's nothing wrong with being able to travel and get your work done.
[00:35:28.933 --> 00:35:32.436]  And I don't have a charity, but if I did, I mean, that's not bad.
[00:35:32.436 --> 00:35:33.557]  Salvation Army gives about 90%.
[00:35:33.557 --> 00:35:36.359]  It's one of the best ones out there from the research I've done.
[00:35:36.359 --> 00:35:37.339]  I give to Salvation Army.
[00:35:37.339 --> 00:35:41.422]  I have no affiliation with it, but I do give some money to it.
[00:35:41.422 --> 00:35:43.284]  But when you get up to like 50% just on the jets,
[00:35:46.829 --> 00:35:51.634]  And then there's foreign donors and you're mixing political donations with your foundation.
[00:35:51.634 --> 00:35:53.556]  It's just illegal on every front.
[00:35:53.556 --> 00:35:57.421]  But of course, like Al Sharpton knows millions, doesn't have to pay taxes.
[00:35:57.421 --> 00:36:02.227]  If I didn't pay $2 million in Federal Reserve taxes, they would arrest me.
[00:36:02.227 --> 00:36:04.129]  You could believe it.
[00:36:04.129 --> 00:36:05.510]  But again, they're above the law.
[00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:06.652]  So let's go to this Bill Clinton clip.
[00:36:08.214 --> 00:36:09.615]  I mean, think about that.
[00:36:09.615 --> 00:36:20.061]  There's this big nefarious strategy to exercise terrible influence over the American government by talking wealthy people in countries aiming to give them money to help the poor people.
[00:36:20.061 --> 00:36:22.002]  That's the theory of the case.
[00:36:22.002 --> 00:36:28.545]  And I just don't believe, over the long run, the American people will figure that out.
[00:36:28.545 --> 00:36:30.767]  Let me talk like a regular guy to you.
[00:36:34.619 --> 00:36:43.921]  And Obama does the same little fake thing where he bites his lip and pauses and goes, like he's actually thinking.
[00:36:43.921 --> 00:36:49.642]  And he's even got, on the teleprompter, it's all fake.
[00:36:49.642 --> 00:36:52.023]  There's no teleprompter here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:53.663 --> 00:36:57.044]  Because I'm speaking from intellect and my heart and passion.
[00:36:57.044 --> 00:36:59.946]  These people sit up there to pacify everyone.
[00:36:59.946 --> 00:37:01.686]  There's no NSA spying.
[00:37:01.686 --> 00:37:07.088]  He didn't have sex with that woman.
[00:37:07.088 --> 00:37:17.232]  Hundreds of millions in foreign political donations when his wife was Secretary of State and she's getting the money and living in houses and flying in helicopters and jets.
[00:37:17.232 --> 00:37:21.854]  We're talking the most expensive $75 million jets is what they're flying on.
[00:37:21.854 --> 00:37:23.335]  The most expensive private jets.
[00:37:27.737 --> 00:37:30.458]  And it's Saudi princes?
[00:37:30.458 --> 00:37:31.918]  Oh, there's no influence there.
[00:37:31.918 --> 00:37:34.759]  How about I start a foundation?
[00:37:34.759 --> 00:37:45.001]  And then just have jets and stuff and then you give none of the money to the poor, basically, and then sit in political office.
[00:37:45.001 --> 00:37:48.622]  People go, oh, who cares about the Bilderberg Group and Hillary violating the Logan Act?
[00:37:48.622 --> 00:37:51.723]  You know, she got fined for that back in the 90s.
[00:37:51.723 --> 00:37:53.043]  Now they don't even get fined.
[00:37:53.043 --> 00:37:54.624]  World leaders and U.S.
[00:37:54.624 --> 00:37:55.764]  leaders go to Bilderberg
[00:37:57.964 --> 00:38:03.848]  They drive in in Secret Service motorcades, and they point guns at us.
[00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:08.731]  We have footage of this in Virginia, because we're there showing the illegal meeting.
[00:38:08.731 --> 00:38:16.157]  And the Secret Service held up MP5s at us, and looked at us like we were evil, like we were intimidated.
[00:38:16.157 --> 00:38:18.118]  We've done nothing wrong!
[00:38:18.118 --> 00:38:19.179]  We're the good guys!
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:34.942]  I mean, what media wouldn't want to cover Hillary and Obama meeting in secret in 2008, when for a day and a half the media's like, where are they, where are they, where are they?
[00:38:34.942 --> 00:38:36.382]  They've disappeared in Virginia.
[00:38:36.382 --> 00:38:39.183]  We knew where they were!
[00:38:39.183 --> 00:38:45.164]  And then they'd have these Marines flipping us off, in uniform and out of uniform.
[00:38:45.164 --> 00:38:48.525]  Just search, Marines flip the bird at Bilderberg.
[00:38:48.525 --> 00:38:49.885]  There's video of it, and photos.
[00:38:51.618 --> 00:39:00.234]  And that was because the Marines didn't know who we were at that time, and they told them, we later learned, from Marines that apologized to me through a back channel.
[00:39:02.461 --> 00:39:06.802]  That we were an anti-military group that hated veterans groups.
[00:39:06.802 --> 00:39:10.403]  I mean, this whole government is about lying to people.
[00:39:10.403 --> 00:39:24.907]  Just like they're on the news saying that Governor Abbott doesn't like the military, and Louie Gohmert doesn't like the military, and Alex Jones doesn't like the military, and Chuck Norris now, you know, we thought you liked the military.
[00:39:24.907 --> 00:39:30.769]  As if liking the military has anything to do, because our friends and family are in it,
[00:39:33.103 --> 00:39:37.245]  And it was founded in 1776 and has such a great history.
[00:39:37.245 --> 00:39:40.767]  It's been hijacked and overtaken.
[00:39:40.767 --> 00:39:42.689]  It's not ours anymore.
[00:39:42.689 --> 00:39:48.212]  The only way to get it back is to admit the country has been stolen.
[00:39:48.212 --> 00:39:55.676]  And they're busy stealing the final little pieces of the puzzle right now.
[00:39:55.676 --> 00:40:00.439]  And finally, praise the Lord, and pass the ammunition in the Infowar.
[00:40:01.598 --> 00:40:04.320]  The sweeping giant that is Texas.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:07.822]  I'm so proud of my state.
[00:40:07.822 --> 00:40:09.704]  A long history of independence.
[00:40:09.704 --> 00:40:12.526]  A long history of wanting to be productive and free.
[00:40:12.526 --> 00:40:16.588]  And of low taxes and Second Amendment.
[00:40:16.588 --> 00:40:20.031]  And all these people evacuating California.
[00:40:20.031 --> 00:40:23.553]  And a good point was made to me by a lot of Californians in emails and calls.
[00:40:23.553 --> 00:40:26.695]  They said, it was pretty much the same sentiment when I've been bashing California.
[00:40:26.695 --> 00:40:29.337]  California's a beautiful state, a lot of great people.
[00:40:29.337 --> 00:40:29.938]  But he said, Alex,
[00:40:31.021 --> 00:40:38.266]  We heard you say that California used to be a lot like Texas, which it was, 50, 60 years ago.
[00:40:38.266 --> 00:40:39.466]  Don't you understand?
[00:40:39.466 --> 00:40:43.649]  Everybody moved here looking for a quick buck and to be stars.
[00:40:43.649 --> 00:40:48.412]  They aren't Californians, so they've now just failed here and they're coming to your state.
[00:40:48.412 --> 00:40:56.017]  Those rude, horrible, demonic, backstabbing, manipulative people that you're talking about
[00:40:57.597 --> 00:41:00.479]  Are not Californians, and I think that's a fair statement.
[00:41:00.479 --> 00:41:05.243]  Because you meet real Californians, laid back, cool, awesome.
[00:41:05.243 --> 00:41:08.786]  They're like, liberal in ways, but conservative in others.
[00:41:08.786 --> 00:41:10.408]  They defy the stereotypes.
[00:41:10.408 --> 00:41:12.730]  They're more classical liberal.
[00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:14.851]  So, it's true.
[00:41:14.851 --> 00:41:16.192]  You're correct, I am corrected.
[00:41:16.192 --> 00:41:22.818]  A lot of people come to Texas now, and you know, half the state's not from Texas, and then they think that's who we are.
[00:41:27.568 --> 00:41:30.611]  But really, it's just a bunch of drifters.
[00:41:30.611 --> 00:41:36.116]  Now, there are a lot of people that have moved from states that are collapsing that are great, hard-working folks, and we love them.
[00:41:36.116 --> 00:41:52.472]  But when you run into failed drifters, they've always got a new scam, they've always got something new to be famous, they've always got some new phlegm phlegm, and they are narcissistic mental patients that travel around like bands of 21st century thuggies.
[00:41:56.738 --> 00:42:03.280]  Just overthrowing your laws, overthrowing your freedoms, fetting the nest like they do everywhere else.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:03.880]  It's amazing.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:11.161]  Now, let's get to the over-the-top, incredibly important Jade Helm news.
[00:42:11.161 --> 00:42:17.263]  First off, do we have the clip from CNN that I sent you yesterday that we only played part of that has Dewhurst?
[00:42:22.878 --> 00:42:26.984]  Yeah, well, what I want is the intro piece that I sent Nico.
[00:42:26.984 --> 00:42:29.727]  In other words, a couple CNN pieces.
[00:42:29.727 --> 00:42:33.893]  But the one I want is where they edit me and come right in with me and Joe.
[00:42:33.893 --> 00:42:34.714]  That's what I want to play.
[00:42:34.714 --> 00:42:36.717]  So we're going to play that today.
[00:42:36.717 --> 00:42:39.200]  In fact, cue that up because I want to play this first.
[00:42:39.981 --> 00:42:42.563]  So we can detail again how the deception works.
[00:42:42.563 --> 00:42:43.683]  We've got it, ready to go.
[00:42:43.683 --> 00:42:44.084]  The U.S.
[00:42:44.084 --> 00:42:47.866]  comes on and says we hate the military and he's trying to defend our poor military.
[00:42:47.866 --> 00:42:54.230]  Well, they got spit on in Vietnam and now, now people are spitting on them again and I don't appreciate that.
[00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:55.911]  He told ABC News that.
[00:42:55.911 --> 00:42:58.052]  He told a bunch of other publications that.
[00:42:58.052 --> 00:43:00.053]  The same old story.
[00:43:00.053 --> 00:43:03.996]  Why it's just so sad they want to spit on the troops.
[00:43:03.996 --> 00:43:06.117]  Preying on the audience.
[00:43:06.117 --> 00:43:08.679]  But before they go to that, they have another piece where
[00:43:10.253 --> 00:43:12.015]  They're running the same story.
[00:43:12.015 --> 00:43:14.277]  Well, the military's confused why they're not liked.
[00:43:14.277 --> 00:43:16.199]  They thought Texas liked them.
[00:43:16.199 --> 00:43:18.261]  Making it about how the military feels bad.
[00:43:18.261 --> 00:43:25.388]  See, using the uniform, using its history, like when that colonel was saying in Bastrop a week and a half ago, you see my uniform?
[00:43:25.388 --> 00:43:26.008]  Trust this.
[00:43:26.008 --> 00:43:26.449]  Trust me.
[00:43:28.697 --> 00:43:30.698]  What, to follow orders like Katrina and take guns?
[00:43:30.698 --> 00:43:36.140]  You mean... No, no, we're gonna try to get control of this government that's been hijacked, that's in control of our military.
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:37.000]  That's what this is about.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.222]  It'd be like saying, are you against the German military in 1937?
[00:43:41.222 --> 00:43:44.363]  No, but I'm against the Fuhrer who runs it.
[00:43:44.363 --> 00:43:46.744]  I mean, this is so elementary.
[00:43:46.744 --> 00:43:52.226]  Curtis LeMay, back in the 60s, wanted to launch a premeditated nuclear attack on Russia.
[00:43:52.226 --> 00:43:53.366]  That was declassified.
[00:43:53.366 --> 00:43:55.087]  They made a movie about it, Dr. Strangelove.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.541]  He's General Jack T. Ripper.
[00:43:59.541 --> 00:44:09.065]  That's based on a real character that wanted to launch a plan, like Plan R, to launch first.
[00:44:09.065 --> 00:44:15.088]  Is it anti-Air Force to not want to have World War III and stop a rogue general launching an attack?
[00:44:15.088 --> 00:44:19.790]  See, that's the bizarre mindset that they say, you do not question if it's military.
[00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:20.571]  You do what you're told.
[00:44:20.571 --> 00:44:22.231]  Well, who runs the military?
[00:44:22.231 --> 00:44:24.392]  Well, now they tell Congress that Congress doesn't.
[00:44:24.392 --> 00:44:25.613]  We're told it's NATO.
[00:44:28.817 --> 00:44:51.630]  Well, now Chuck Norris has come out, Louie Gohmert's come out, and they're all saying, no, we're tired of being lied to, we don't trust the government, Senator Ted Cruz, we know the military is taking part in operations to go after the Tea Party, so anytime there's a giant operation, we don't believe a word Obama says, and all the new generals he's put in, the thousands of officers he's purged, we're gonna watch it!
[00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:56.673]  We don't know this is nefarious, but they keep changing their story.
[00:44:56.673 --> 00:44:57.874]  Let's go ahead and go to the CNN Club.
[00:44:59.292 --> 00:45:08.055]  By directing the State Guard to monitor the operations, we'll allow Texas... Don't mess with Texas, is Republican Governor Greg Abbott's message to the Pentagon.
[00:45:08.055 --> 00:45:10.977]  Abbott called out his State Guard to keep an eye on U.S.
[00:45:10.977 --> 00:45:11.697]  Special Operations.
[00:45:12.557 --> 00:45:23.701]  His letter said, we respect the military and totally trust the troops themselves, but the federal government, as we know, has been power grabbing a lot lately, and Texans are concerned, so the state's going to follow its separation of powers.
[00:45:23.701 --> 00:45:24.902]  I'm paraphrasing the letter.
[00:45:24.902 --> 00:45:25.502]  You can go read it.
[00:45:25.502 --> 00:45:27.043]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:45:27.043 --> 00:45:28.823]  And we're going to monitor it and work with them.
[00:45:28.823 --> 00:45:30.864]  By the way, the state guard was already working with them.
[00:45:30.864 --> 00:45:36.186]  Where the whole thing's based out of, by Bastrop and in Smithville in Camp Swift.
[00:45:36.186 --> 00:45:40.228]  A former largest prisoner of war camp for Germans in World War II.
[00:45:42.981 --> 00:45:44.482]  And the state guards leaked some stuff.
[00:45:44.482 --> 00:45:49.466]  Look, I told you a month ago that Greg Abbott's awake and knows what's going on.
[00:45:49.466 --> 00:45:51.647]  I told you Chuck Norris was aware of this and concerned.
[00:45:51.647 --> 00:45:52.788]  You notice they're in the news.
[00:45:52.788 --> 00:45:59.773]  We're going to have some Chuck Norris world news next Tuesday.
[00:45:59.773 --> 00:46:03.516]  I'll just leave that as it may, but Chuck Norris is a listener.
[00:46:03.516 --> 00:46:10.521]  His son's a listener, accomplished filmmaker, and I was told about some of these things before they were even named.
[00:46:11.542 --> 00:46:17.664]  Two and a half months ago on a movie shoot in North Texas, and I'm going to leave it at that until next week.
[00:46:17.664 --> 00:46:26.126]  But I told you the news was so amazing that I wouldn't even cover it on air, even though I was given authorization to talk about it.
[00:46:26.126 --> 00:46:29.447]  I just, my gut was, don't talk about it yet.
[00:46:29.447 --> 00:46:36.049]  Wait till all this stuff starts to come out, and then let it peak.
[00:46:36.049 --> 00:46:37.850]  Because I didn't know the name of Jade Helm then.
[00:46:38.999 --> 00:46:40.980]  I just knew this stuff was coming.
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:44.562]  And believe me, the governor knows stuff the public doesn't know.
[00:46:44.562 --> 00:46:51.705]  So, this is America starting to wake up.
[00:46:51.705 --> 00:47:03.451]  Read the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 and it says to prepare for insurrection in the states and in the legislatures or governments.
[00:47:04.497 --> 00:47:07.638]  They're preparing the military to take over states.
[00:47:07.638 --> 00:47:16.783]  Obama, three years ago, said they'd invade Texas with F-16s and run an air blockade.
[00:47:16.783 --> 00:47:19.684]  If Texas voted to block the TSA.
[00:47:19.684 --> 00:47:23.046]  Groping genitals.
[00:47:23.046 --> 00:47:24.106]  I forget the exact headline.
[00:47:24.106 --> 00:47:31.810]  It was, uh... Feds to block air travel to Texas if legislature restricts TSA.
[00:47:33.514 --> 00:47:35.456]  And you'll get newspapers all over the state.
[00:47:35.456 --> 00:47:37.518]  You can't make this stuff up, folks.
[00:47:37.518 --> 00:47:42.461]  And then I've got Louie Gohmert with just incredible quotes.
[00:47:42.461 --> 00:47:44.203]  He's been on the broadcast before.
[00:47:44.203 --> 00:47:47.906]  He, of course, was an Army officer himself.
[00:47:47.906 --> 00:47:50.648]  They're now claiming he's anti-military.
[00:47:50.648 --> 00:47:54.511]  Louie Gohmert gets why some Texans are worried about a military takeover.
[00:47:54.511 --> 00:47:55.292]  National Journal.
[00:47:56.789 --> 00:48:03.955]  The Texas Congressman is joining others in his state calling for the Pentagon to alter Jade Helm 15 military exercises.
[00:48:03.955 --> 00:48:11.741]  And he goes on to say, and he's on the different committees, he's never seen in a drill a state listed as hostile.
[00:48:11.741 --> 00:48:12.581]  It's unprecedented.
[00:48:15.936 --> 00:48:19.278]  And by the way, they keep saying, we've had drills in Texas before.
[00:48:19.278 --> 00:48:20.879]  Yeah, out in the desert.
[00:48:20.879 --> 00:48:22.140]  Tank busting.
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:26.742]  If they had Apache helicopters practicing to blow up Russian tanks, we would expect that.
[00:48:26.742 --> 00:48:29.404]  That's not what this is.
[00:48:29.404 --> 00:48:30.524]  Look, we've done it before.
[00:48:30.524 --> 00:48:32.105]  Yeah, of course you've done it before.
[00:48:32.105 --> 00:48:32.706]  It's not this.
[00:48:34.218 --> 00:48:34.418]  U.S.
[00:48:34.418 --> 00:48:43.207]  Special Operations Command preparing to launch a month-long multi-state exercise across private and public to prepare Army Special Forces for threats anywhere in the world.
[00:48:43.207 --> 00:48:44.749]  That's an accurate statement.
[00:48:44.749 --> 00:48:47.111]  Or at least that's what the Pentagon would have you believe.
[00:48:47.111 --> 00:48:54.319]  Officials and citizens in Texas, one of the states involved, see something potentially more nefarious in the exercise, dubbed Jade Helm.
[00:48:54.319 --> 00:48:55.960]  And now Representative Louie Gohmert is joining them.
[00:48:56.741 --> 00:49:07.787]  Over the past few weeks, my office has been inundated with calls for a Jade Helm 15 military exercise scheduled to take place between July 15th and September 15th, Gohmert said in a statement Tuesday.
[00:49:07.787 --> 00:49:10.448]  The military practice has some concern that the U.S.
[00:49:10.448 --> 00:49:12.649]  Army is preparing for modern-day martial law.
[00:49:12.649 --> 00:49:14.970]  Certainly, I can understand these concerns.
[00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:16.871]  He can understand the concerns?
[00:49:16.871 --> 00:49:19.193]  Yeah!
[00:49:19.193 --> 00:49:21.494]  Because Louie Gohmert knows what comes across his desk.
[00:49:22.677 --> 00:49:28.559]  The Pentagon's mission is to take on the Patriots, and no one knows how to broach this, because you'll get attacked when you bring it up.
[00:49:28.559 --> 00:49:32.220]  So these politicians, these statesmen, like the fact that we've brought it out.
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:35.181]  I'm going to skip this network break, this is so important.
[00:49:35.181 --> 00:49:39.863]  They like the fact that we brought all this out, because now it makes it safer for them to talk about it.
[00:49:41.806 --> 00:49:46.787]  And now everybody's passing around the hundreds of news articles where with a straight face trying to sell it.
[00:49:46.787 --> 00:49:49.008]  See, when we say it's bad, they go, it doesn't exist.
[00:49:49.008 --> 00:49:54.289]  But when they go, yeah, thank God the Army's trained to take on tea parties and take the guns.
[00:49:54.289 --> 00:49:56.950]  And that, you know, those veterans are going to attack the police departments.
[00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:58.230]  Yeah, those horrible veterans.
[00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:00.911]  See, they have the nerve to claim we don't like the veterans.
[00:50:02.677 --> 00:50:07.344]  When they got him on Stinkin' Don't Treat List and are training to take him on as a number one enemy.
[00:50:07.344 --> 00:50:15.616]  What do you think the globalists have got planned that's so horrible in this country that they know the veterans are going to come out and fight?
[00:50:15.616 --> 00:50:18.159]  It makes me shake to my bones.
[00:50:20.259 --> 00:50:38.105]  And not in a fearful way, just in a shocked, bracing way, when I think about what we've put up with, and what it must be they've got planned, that they know the veterans are going to stand up, and they're actually teaching every police department in the country to prepare for a war with the vets.
[00:50:38.105 --> 00:50:45.368]  Can you imagine the police departments, as able as many of them are, taking on unidentified vets?
[00:50:46.582 --> 00:50:50.286]  Once you start going after vets and persecuting them and stuff, man, the gloves are going to come off.
[00:50:50.286 --> 00:50:51.887]  And that's the plan.
[00:50:51.887 --> 00:50:55.250]  Have the vets devastate the local governments.
[00:50:55.250 --> 00:51:00.115]  Just like Al Sharpton said, we're going to use all this to federalize everything.
[00:51:00.115 --> 00:51:08.583]  It's a takedown plan by the globalists with their socialist and communist followers to get us at each other's throats, as I've been warning for six, seven years.
[00:51:08.583 --> 00:51:11.646]  And now it's clear that's what they're doing.
[00:51:15.029 --> 00:51:21.675]  And I told you this will all kick off as an info war first, where they say we hate the vets, we hate the police, when it's not true.
[00:51:21.675 --> 00:51:27.459]  Ahead of staging terror attacks, they're going to blame on us.
[00:51:27.459 --> 00:51:33.584]  This is the only play they've got left now, folks.
[00:51:33.584 --> 00:51:40.030]  Look at CNN, Pentagon, No Texas Takeover, New York Times, LA Times, there was over 400 new articles today.
[00:51:41.357 --> 00:51:47.380]  Go to Google, type in Jade Helm, click News, and you'll see it was over 400 this morning.
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:50.402]  In the last 24 hours.
[00:51:50.402 --> 00:52:00.927]  400 articles, TV shows, you name it.
[00:52:00.927 --> 00:52:07.831]  Now I sent you guys, and maybe it's that clip, but the one I sent you was right from the start, you may have trimmed it, where it's us right up front, during the break,
[00:52:08.544 --> 00:52:10.165]  I'll bring it to you.
[00:52:10.165 --> 00:52:18.487]  Or it's right here in my phone, so that we can get that clip, because I... Okay, well the clip I had just started there.
[00:52:18.487 --> 00:52:20.448]  We're going to play it here in just a moment.
[00:52:20.448 --> 00:52:23.789]  But let's just go back to what Gohmert's saying here.
[00:52:23.789 --> 00:52:27.491]  So he says, he can understand the concerns of martial law.
[00:52:27.491 --> 00:52:31.392]  I mean, they're shutting our power plants off outside law and opening the borders up.
[00:52:31.392 --> 00:52:33.413]  That is martial law.
[00:52:33.413 --> 00:52:34.413]  It's an increment of it.
[00:52:36.564 --> 00:52:48.572]  When leaders, quoting the congressman, within the current administration believe that major threats to the country include those who support the Constitution and military veterans, or even clinging to guns or religion, patriotic Americans have reason to be concerned.
[00:52:48.572 --> 00:52:51.474]  Everything Gohmert quoted is public there.
[00:52:51.474 --> 00:52:57.417]  Bitter clingers, veterans, gun owners, number one enemy.
[00:52:57.417 --> 00:53:02.020]  The congressman took particular issue with the layout of the labels on the Pentagon map of the exercise.
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:03.962]  Once I observed the map depicting hostile
[00:53:04.773 --> 00:53:07.155]  Permissive and uncertain states and locations.
[00:53:07.155 --> 00:53:13.860]  I was rather appalled that the hostile areas, amazingly, have a Republican majority.
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:28.011]  Cling to their guns and religion and believe in the sanctity of the United States Constitution, government called on the Pentagon to change the map, the names on the map, and said the tone of the exercise needs to be completely revamped so the federal government is not intentionally practicing war against its own states.
[00:53:28.011 --> 00:53:28.892]  And that's what this is about.
[00:53:30.535 --> 00:53:39.103]  Getting the military used to being deployed so they can then give them a new mission that is go after the people, which they admit is going on behind the scenes with smaller groups.
[00:53:39.103 --> 00:53:41.906]  So then roll it up and scale it up.
[00:53:42.881 --> 00:53:47.222]  But we're taking their attack, like weights, and making our muscles for freedom stronger.
[00:53:47.222 --> 00:54:10.009]  Instead of laying down, we're pushing the weight back, educating people about posse comitatus, educating people about federalism, educating people about the roles of the military and civilian leadership, and pushing back to have a national debate about why are there drills all over the country, why is this happening, and so many times we go put a camera on it, and they're trying to take on the American people.
[00:54:10.009 --> 00:54:10.929]  Here's that CNN clip.
[00:54:12.321 --> 00:54:20.507]  The site Infowars has led the internet buzz, insisting it's all a plan for the army to wage war on Americans.
[00:54:20.507 --> 00:54:26.551]  Publishing a military PowerPoint slide showing Texas as red enemy territory.
[00:54:26.551 --> 00:54:30.654]  I've hardly ever heard of something joint like this unless they're actually planning an invasion.
[00:54:30.654 --> 00:54:32.115]  It was.
[00:54:32.115 --> 00:54:33.096]  Back it up.
[00:54:33.096 --> 00:54:38.139]  Notice they didn't say that it was admitted to be real.
[00:54:38.139 --> 00:54:40.681]  They went with earlier propaganda that it was fake, remember?
[00:54:41.764 --> 00:54:44.886]  The Army Times and stuff said, well, this probably isn't real.
[00:54:44.886 --> 00:54:50.570]  We don't trust the... They knew full well it was on army.mil.
[00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:54.992]  Then they said that we said it was secret and that we had something secret that wasn't.
[00:54:54.992 --> 00:54:57.794]  Now they revert back to the old lie.
[00:54:57.794 --> 00:54:59.275]  See, every five seconds is a lie.
[00:54:59.275 --> 00:55:00.696]  This is psych warfare written.
[00:55:02.312 --> 00:55:10.558]  And when you know how to identify it, it's disgusting that they would pray, that's the word, feed, on the ignorance of the public, implying we made that up.
[00:55:10.558 --> 00:55:11.839]  But again, that's almost subliminal.
[00:55:11.839 --> 00:55:16.402]  It's just, yeah, they published this map claiming Texas.
[00:55:16.402 --> 00:55:19.385]  No, there is no claim, lady.
[00:55:19.385 --> 00:55:20.465]  Gosh, you're dishonorable.
[00:55:20.465 --> 00:55:22.827]  Just looking at you makes me feel dishonorable.
[00:55:22.827 --> 00:55:24.368]  Thank God I'm not you.
[00:55:24.368 --> 00:55:25.189]  Let's go back to the clip.
[00:55:26.817 --> 00:55:30.981]  I've hardly ever heard of something joint like this unless they're actually planning an invasion.
[00:55:30.981 --> 00:55:37.285]  Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz says he understands Texans' worries.
[00:55:37.285 --> 00:55:44.831]  I think part of the reason is we have seen for six years a federal government disrespecting the liberty of the citizens.
[00:55:44.831 --> 00:55:46.272]  Good job guys, thank you.
[00:55:46.272 --> 00:55:54.278]  And then there's the Washington Post and, I don't know, you type in the name Chuck Norris, I saw over 400 articles basically
[00:55:55.776 --> 00:56:04.280]  They got to be more careful with Chuck Norris because he's so universally liked across the board that they just quote him.
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:09.603]  Chuck Norris joins Ted Cruz and others in Operation Jade Helm Conspiracy Watch.
[00:56:09.603 --> 00:56:11.764]  But they still use the word conspiracy.
[00:56:11.764 --> 00:56:15.546]  And he just goes on to say, listen, we've seen the government do so much bad stuff.
[00:56:15.546 --> 00:56:17.147]  It's good to have the state watch things.
[00:56:17.147 --> 00:56:18.328]  That's all the governor's doing.
[00:56:19.432 --> 00:56:22.174]  I mean, you can just go read the quotes yourself, I'm paraphrasing them.
[00:56:22.174 --> 00:56:30.640]  There's a WorldNet Daily article, Jade Helm 15, Crime Stoppers, and KSK.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:31.621]  He says, I have an idea.
[00:56:31.621 --> 00:56:37.485]  The government insists on running expanded military ops across seven southwest states for the cost of billions, I would add.
[00:56:37.485 --> 00:56:41.027]  Why doesn't it move all the military training south to protect our borders at the same time?
[00:56:41.027 --> 00:56:42.268]  Yeah, that's actually a constitutional duty.
[00:56:43.956 --> 00:56:48.000]  Whatever Jane Helm 15 actually is, I think it's more than coincidental.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:54.125]  The FBI director just confessed in February that the presence of ISIS can be felt in 50 states, and it goes on from there.
[00:56:54.125 --> 00:56:57.468]  And then they misrepresent what he says.
[00:56:57.468 --> 00:56:59.370]  He goes on to say, trust but verify.
[00:57:01.946 --> 00:57:07.291]  Friends, when it comes to freedom, we must question, verify, and vet everyone and everything.
[00:57:07.291 --> 00:57:23.846]  As Thomas Jefferson told his nephew, Peter, in 1787, question with boldness even the existence of a God, because if there is to be one, he must more approve the homage of reason than that of a blindfolded fear.
[00:57:25.353 --> 00:57:28.656]  We must never check our brains or blindly trust, especially the government.
[00:57:28.656 --> 00:57:36.223]  Rather, we must fight until our dying breaths for liberty, especially when it appears those in power are trying to knock down old glory.
[00:57:36.223 --> 00:57:37.804]  Yeah!
[00:57:37.804 --> 00:57:39.166]  Obama?
[00:57:39.166 --> 00:57:40.267]  Care?
[00:57:40.267 --> 00:57:41.128]  Open borders?
[00:57:41.128 --> 00:57:42.449]  Outside of law?
[00:57:42.449 --> 00:57:43.470]  Fast and furious?
[00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:44.070]  Benghazi?
[00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:45.612]  I mean, we'd be crazy!
[00:57:45.612 --> 00:57:48.995]  And he goes on to quote Benjamin Franklin in here.
[00:57:51.278 --> 00:57:54.061]  As well, I'm going to find that and come back and cover that.
[00:57:54.061 --> 00:57:58.026]  Briefly, you fund this operation with your purchases.
[00:57:58.026 --> 00:57:59.348]  We won't be here if you don't support us.
[00:57:59.348 --> 00:58:04.654]  You are supporting us, so we're getting reporters, we're sending them around, we're breaking news, we're having an effect.
[00:58:04.654 --> 00:58:06.176]  There's nowhere where your support...
[00:58:06.937 --> 00:58:08.158]  Which scares the daylights out of me.
[00:58:08.158 --> 00:58:09.138]  Man, I'm really asking for it.
[00:58:09.138 --> 00:58:11.680]  Just, God, please, protect me and my family.
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:15.943]  Because I can tell you, folks, we're on the front line going up against the enemy.
[00:58:15.943 --> 00:58:17.124]  And we're going 110 percent.
[00:58:17.124 --> 00:58:18.405]  It's the only way to beat these people.
[00:58:18.405 --> 00:58:20.146]  But we need you to buy the products.
[00:58:20.146 --> 00:58:21.527]  The Super Male Vitality.
[00:58:21.527 --> 00:58:25.289]  The Super Female, after almost three months being out, is back.
[00:58:25.289 --> 00:58:26.590]  It's a great gift for Mother's Day.
[00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:30.473]  You can just drop ship it to Mom's house, or your wife, or whatever.
[00:58:30.473 --> 00:58:34.455]  It's just Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.

[00:58:55.477 --> 00:58:56.718]  Security alert.
[00:58:56.718 --> 00:58:58.719]  This is Homeland Security.

[00:59:02.282 --> 00:59:07.306]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:59:07.306 --> 00:59:08.347]  Crime Directive.
[00:59:08.347 --> 00:59:09.888]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:59:09.888 --> 00:59:12.750]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:15.993]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:59:15.993 --> 00:59:18.294]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:59:18.294 --> 00:59:19.015]  These people are a
[00:59:19.215 --> 00:59:22.617]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:59:22.617 --> 00:59:24.578]  They are never going to stop.
[00:59:24.578 --> 00:59:28.641]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[00:59:38.586 --> 00:59:43.129]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:59:43.129 --> 00:59:44.670]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:45.410]  You can feel it.
[00:59:51.118 --> 01:00:03.023]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.023 --> 01:00:04.324]  Big Brother.
[01:00:04.324 --> 01:00:06.085]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:06.085 --> 01:00:07.846]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:07.846 --> 01:00:09.446]  You want answers?
[01:00:09.446 --> 01:00:10.987]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:10.987 --> 01:00:15.169]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.169 --> 01:00:19.251]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.048 --> 01:00:30.450]  The enemy is showing itself more and more.
[01:00:30.450 --> 01:00:34.231]  Globalism is out in the open.
[01:00:34.231 --> 01:00:38.493]  And it is legendary.
[01:00:38.493 --> 01:00:39.193]  It is epic.
[01:00:39.193 --> 01:00:49.898]  It is biblical that Texas is resisting the way it is.
[01:00:49.898 --> 01:00:53.400]  My uncle that died last year, this is a total sweetheart,
[01:00:55.267 --> 01:01:03.053]  Vietnam helicopter veteran pilot with special operations taught me so much of what I know.
[01:01:03.053 --> 01:01:06.256]  My dad taught me probably more, but my uncle was a close second.
[01:01:10.273 --> 01:01:13.474]  He listened to Pastor David J. Smith, which I think is still around.
[01:01:13.474 --> 01:01:14.714]  I never have time to listen to him.
[01:01:14.714 --> 01:01:16.395]  Up in Waxahachie.
[01:01:16.395 --> 01:01:22.176]  And Smith wasn't the type that was constantly saying he had visions about this and visions about that.
[01:01:22.176 --> 01:01:23.657]  But he was kind of a mainline preacher.
[01:01:23.657 --> 01:01:34.680]  I think it was up in Oklahoma, like 30-something years ago, and he had a vision that a world government was going to take over and that Texas would be a stronghold against it.
[01:01:35.876 --> 01:01:48.660]  My uncle said that with his discernment and prayer that he knew that was true and that this is what I was already on the air.
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:53.442]  And that basically I should tell people that and try to help folks make preparation for it.
[01:01:53.442 --> 01:01:54.302]  Of course I never did.
[01:01:54.302 --> 01:01:56.763]  I've never spoken of this until now.
[01:01:56.763 --> 01:01:59.424]  And then now I just see Texas across the board resisting.
[01:02:04.038 --> 01:02:14.256]  And the first place to start with the giant, the sleeping giant is starting to wake up as world government and smart dust and TV's watching everybody.
[01:02:14.256 --> 01:02:15.338]  I mean, my God!
[01:02:16.638 --> 01:02:18.980]  Global abortion.
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:27.788]  Like I said, none of us are safe when the veterans can be put on don't treat lists and they just spin the whole thing like, oh, the VA screwed up.
[01:02:27.788 --> 01:02:29.590]  That'd be like saying Jeffrey Dahmer screwed up.
[01:02:29.590 --> 01:02:30.631]  No, he didn't screw up, man.
[01:02:30.631 --> 01:02:31.972]  It was premeditated.
[01:02:31.972 --> 01:02:33.653]  John Wayne Gacy was premeditated.
[01:02:33.653 --> 01:02:34.974]  Ted Bundy was premeditated.
[01:02:34.974 --> 01:02:37.637]  I'm tired of it!
[01:02:37.637 --> 01:02:42.061]  And I'll be honest with you, I don't like messing with these dangerous people.
[01:02:43.763 --> 01:02:47.967]  But if you're going to mess with them, because they're not going to quit messing with us, you better go all the way.
[01:02:47.967 --> 01:02:58.215]  And that's just all I can tell you is, man, I wish every day I'd been wrong about all this stuff.
[01:02:58.215 --> 01:03:03.480]  I mean, I wish every day that I was wrong.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.301]  And you know what?
[01:03:04.301 --> 01:03:05.341]  I wasn't wrong about any of it.
[01:03:05.341 --> 01:03:06.843]  And I'll tell you why I wasn't wrong about any of it.
[01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:15.612]  I just began studying this and getting on the trail of it after all these great people.
[01:03:15.612 --> 01:03:29.197]  John Birchers, FBI agents, cops, people like my uncle, scholars like my dad, countless other people when I was a kid talked about all this and my heavenly father
[01:03:31.283 --> 01:03:45.235]  I cannot believe how right they were and how they were fighting so hard back then when nobody knew the Federal Reserve was private and nobody knew what was going on to warn people so we'd have a defense down the road when all of this came down.
[01:03:48.513 --> 01:03:53.498]  Because once the shields fall and real tyranny comes in, they're coming after everybody, folks.
[01:03:53.498 --> 01:03:55.460]  And I don't mean people that just fought evil.
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:04:00.725]  They hate anyone who is upright and beautiful and strong and who has built something.
[01:04:00.725 --> 01:04:04.148]  These people have a will to dominate.
[01:04:04.148 --> 01:04:07.612]  The next guy we got coming up gets persecuted for planting city gardens.
[01:04:10.452 --> 01:04:13.859]  They just hate normal human life.
[01:04:13.859 --> 01:04:16.164]  Men and women loving each other.
[01:04:16.164 --> 01:04:17.226]  Families.
[01:04:17.226 --> 01:04:18.108]  Gardening.
[01:04:18.108 --> 01:04:19.330]  Farmers.
[01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:20.352]  Ranching.
[01:04:20.352 --> 01:04:20.933]  Metallurgy.
[01:04:22.162 --> 01:04:24.524]  Physical fitness.
[01:04:24.524 --> 01:04:25.245]  Wholesomeness.
[01:04:25.245 --> 01:04:30.770]  And it doesn't mean those of us that want wholesomeness are on some high horse or are perfect.
[01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:35.154]  It just means we want to gravitate towards that.
[01:04:35.154 --> 01:04:38.257]  Look, there's not room for both groups of evil and good.
[01:04:38.257 --> 01:04:39.258]  You understand that?
[01:04:39.258 --> 01:04:41.060]  The evil wants extinct good.
[01:04:42.967 --> 01:04:56.365]  And to see the amazing awakening happening is buoying and invigorating but also horrifying because, man, the enemy is freaked out right now and they're gonna attack like a ton of bricks.
[01:04:58.584 --> 01:05:02.426]  Listen to how a drone could spoof Wi-Fi and steal your data.
[01:05:02.426 --> 01:05:09.751]  By attaching a tiny computer to a drone, robot experts were able to show how the device could be used for nefarious purposes.
[01:05:09.751 --> 01:05:15.915]  While in the sky, the drone poses as an open Wi-Fi network and tricks other devices to connect to it.
[01:05:16.195 --> 01:05:23.239]  Once that connection has been made, any information that passes through, like credit card information or home addresses, can be obtained.
[01:05:23.239 --> 01:05:31.444]  Because drones are inexpensive, small, and hard to detect when they're high in the sky, bad guys can operate illegally and anonymously.
[01:05:31.684 --> 01:05:34.366]  But there are some simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:34.366 --> 01:05:37.307]  Avoiding open Wi-Fi networks is the first step.
[01:05:37.307 --> 01:05:43.391]  And if you must connect to a public Wi-Fi network, make sure the web address you visit is correct and not a dummy site.
[01:05:43.391 --> 01:05:47.513]  Only open websites that have HTTPS in the address.
[01:05:47.513 --> 01:05:55.117]  And when accessing a banking website, only continue if a lock appears indicating that it's a secure and encrypted connection.
[01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:57.699]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:05:58.579 --> 01:06:08.227]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here!
[01:06:08.227 --> 01:06:18.155]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:06:18.155 --> 01:06:21.077]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:24.339]  And contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients.
[01:06:24.339 --> 01:06:28.522]  Often times full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[01:06:28.522 --> 01:06:33.186]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[01:06:33.186 --> 01:06:35.627]  Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[01:06:35.627 --> 01:06:37.869]  And there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.
[01:06:38.189 --> 01:06:43.854]  Instead, Oxy-Powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[01:06:43.854 --> 01:06:49.198]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[01:06:49.198 --> 01:06:55.163]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with Oxy-Powder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:58.385 --> 01:06:59.325]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:06:59.325 --> 01:06:59.906]  Good, brother.
[01:06:59.906 --> 01:07:01.847]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:07:01.847 --> 01:07:03.567]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:07:03.567 --> 01:07:07.589]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:10.210]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:12.631]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:07:12.631 --> 01:07:20.515]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:07:20.815 --> 01:07:24.037]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:07:24.037 --> 01:07:25.598]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:07:25.598 --> 01:07:28.479]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:07:28.479 --> 01:07:30.260]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:36.063]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[01:07:36.323 --> 01:07:38.124]  Or maximum potency.
[01:07:38.124 --> 01:07:44.588]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience.
[01:07:44.588 --> 01:07:48.330]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:50.131]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:07:50.131 --> 01:07:57.055]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:08:08.856 --> 01:08:19.003]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[01:08:28.451 --> 01:08:30.653]  It's a military mission in North St.
[01:08:30.653 --> 01:08:31.294]  Louis.
[01:08:31.294 --> 01:08:38.521]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[01:08:38.521 --> 01:08:43.326]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[01:08:43.326 --> 01:08:44.387]  Guns will be taken.
[01:08:44.387 --> 01:08:45.708]  No one will ever be armed.
[01:08:45.708 --> 01:08:46.689]  We will take all weapons.
[01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:49.270]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[01:08:49.270 --> 01:08:53.813]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:08:53.813 --> 01:08:54.673]  Enough.
[01:08:54.673 --> 01:08:55.474]  Enough.
[01:08:55.474 --> 01:08:56.554]  Enough.
[01:08:56.554 --> 01:08:56.914]  Enough.
[01:08:56.914 --> 01:09:01.497]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[01:09:01.497 --> 01:09:05.439]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[01:09:05.819 --> 01:09:12.706]  And as KSLA News 12's Jeff Ferrell discovered, the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem.
[01:09:12.706 --> 01:09:13.026]  Us.
[01:09:13.026 --> 01:09:21.054]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:09:21.054 --> 01:09:24.657]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[01:09:24.657 --> 01:09:26.279]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:33.385]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:09:33.385 --> 01:09:38.328]  Blackhawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[01:09:38.328 --> 01:09:50.777]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[01:09:50.777 --> 01:09:55.740]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[01:09:57.402 --> 01:09:58.544]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[01:09:58.544 --> 01:09:59.766]  Go back inside right now!
[01:09:59.766 --> 01:10:00.787]  I am inside.
[01:10:00.787 --> 01:10:02.710]  I have two words for you.
[01:10:02.710 --> 01:10:04.512]  Predator clones.
[01:10:04.512 --> 01:10:05.534]  You will never see it coming.
[01:10:09.562 --> 01:10:12.423]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[01:10:12.423 --> 01:10:21.665]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[01:10:21.665 --> 01:10:27.127]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[01:10:27.127 --> 01:10:32.188]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down.
[01:10:32.188 --> 01:10:34.249]  If you want to, come and take them!
[01:10:36.039 --> 01:10:37.761]  We are on the march.
[01:10:37.761 --> 01:10:40.543]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:10:40.543 --> 01:10:45.248]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:11:00.262 --> 01:11:05.868]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[01:11:05.868 --> 01:11:08.592]  This is the heart of 1776!
[01:11:11.653 --> 01:11:17.397]  Alright, coming up to about 40 after, and then I'm going to get into the over-the-top ISIS news.
[01:11:17.397 --> 01:11:21.419]  Claims it has 71 trained soldiers in 15 different states.
[01:11:21.419 --> 01:11:24.882]  Hillary Clinton vows to expand Obama amnesty to more illegals.
[01:11:24.882 --> 01:11:27.624]  Civil forfeiture, you can't make this stuff up.
[01:11:27.624 --> 01:11:29.225]  The latest on the Clinton Foundation.
[01:11:29.225 --> 01:11:32.307]  The latest on what's happening with the global economy.
[01:11:33.647 --> 01:11:37.130]  More Jade Helm I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:42.475]  Benjamin Franklin said, distrust and caution are the parents of security.
[01:11:42.475 --> 01:11:45.577]  He also said security without liberty is called prison.
[01:11:45.577 --> 01:11:50.081]  Both apply to what I want to show you today in my Culture Warrior column.
[01:11:50.081 --> 01:11:53.184]  That's Chuck Norris.
[01:11:53.184 --> 01:11:56.547]  And to be a little blasphemous, but not intentionally, I mean it's a joke.
[01:11:56.547 --> 01:11:59.089]  If Chuck Norris be with us and for us, who be against us?
[01:12:01.556 --> 01:12:04.557]  Alright, that's a little too far on the Chuck Norris jokes.
[01:12:04.557 --> 01:12:17.561]  But, I first heard about all this from the whole Norris Combine, about Jade Helm and stuff several months ago, and I talked about it.
[01:12:17.561 --> 01:12:23.123]  I said, huge military news, with the governor, with stuff that's going on with the feds, the state knows what's going on.
[01:12:23.123 --> 01:12:24.503]  Well, of course the state knows!
[01:12:24.503 --> 01:12:29.965]  I mean, we've had half our power plants seized, outside of law, and just shut off.
[01:12:31.425 --> 01:12:36.189]  And that all ties into the war on lemonade stands that Forbes asked a few years ago.
[01:12:36.189 --> 01:12:37.430]  Why is there a war on lemonade stands?
[01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:38.831]  Why is there a war on Amish?
[01:12:38.831 --> 01:12:41.613]  Why is there a war on backyard gardens?
[01:12:41.613 --> 01:12:44.175]  And they said in Tulsa, we want inspections.
[01:12:44.175 --> 01:12:46.076]  You might be growing pie.
[01:12:46.076 --> 01:12:48.618]  Because there's nothing worse than a backyard garden, folks.
[01:12:48.618 --> 01:12:53.142]  Or zone people harassing folks for tomatoes growing in their windows or whatever.
[01:12:54.801 --> 01:12:57.262]  Yeah, there's the headline, The Inexplicable War on Lemonade Cans.
[01:12:57.262 --> 01:13:03.585]  No, it's big megabox stores that want to end normal human activity and have giant food deserts everywhere.
[01:13:03.585 --> 01:13:08.147]  Let me tell you, one of the most enjoyable things, I don't have time to do it anymore, my kids do it.
[01:13:09.744 --> 01:13:12.367]  It's so much fun to go out and till the soil.
[01:13:12.367 --> 01:13:16.373]  We got nine acres out in the country, outside Austin, just a little plot on the end.
[01:13:16.373 --> 01:13:18.295]  Fruit trees on it and stuff.
[01:13:18.295 --> 01:13:24.403]  It's so much fun to pick the plums and pick the apples and pick the, you know, different things that are out there.
[01:13:24.403 --> 01:13:25.645]  It's so much fun to pick the
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:34.207]  Spinach and picked the squash and to even grow our own pumpkins and things like that.
[01:13:34.207 --> 01:13:35.528]  And it's just so simple.
[01:13:35.528 --> 01:13:37.911]  You plant it, you take care of it, it grows.
[01:13:37.911 --> 01:13:39.092]  My favorite is hot peppers.
[01:13:39.092 --> 01:13:44.778]  I mean, you're talking about for a couple dollars you could have a whole field of pepper plants growing.
[01:13:44.778 --> 01:13:46.620]  You could take them to a farmer's market and sell them.
[01:13:47.449 --> 01:13:49.631]  But there's a war against that.
[01:13:49.631 --> 01:13:59.799]  And I remember reading about Johnny Appleseed three years ago, and I remember reading about him in school, but I re-read about Johnny Appleseed in seven states.
[01:13:59.799 --> 01:14:07.006]  His estimated planting over a million apple trees and other fruit trees, and teaching people how to take care of themselves.
[01:14:07.006 --> 01:14:11.529]  Well, Germany forever plants stuff in the highway right-of-ways.
[01:14:12.330 --> 01:14:18.975]  And local community groups just go and they just pick an area and they just plant fruit trees and stuff and they go and pick them and they eat them and they can them and they sell them or whatever.
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:22.221]  Well, here though, that's the new crime.
[01:14:22.221 --> 01:14:23.661]  And I didn't even know this guy was doing this.
[01:14:23.661 --> 01:14:29.123]  I separately, you can watch the video at the Infowars Seed Center at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:14:29.123 --> 01:14:35.025]  We have eight different companies, the best low-cost, high-quality, non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[01:14:35.025 --> 01:14:40.787]  Because Monsanto's in a war to buy up all the seeds with two other GMO companies and just basically ban their sale.
[01:14:40.787 --> 01:14:42.748]  But these are groups still doing it.
[01:14:42.748 --> 01:14:43.188]  Everything
[01:14:44.150 --> 01:15:03.139]  You need to survive, and I've explained that even in urban areas, we've gone out and shown this on video, you can go to the middle of the highway in the middle of the woods with some little 200 square foot open area of the sun, dig it up, plant tomatoes, and get more tomatoes than you can ever even harvest.
[01:15:03.139 --> 01:15:04.060]  This is nature's bounty.
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:10.583]  Ron Finley has had arrest warrants issued for him out in L.A.
[01:15:10.583 --> 01:15:19.409]  trying to get this going, and the studies show you get young people growing things, or you get young people even with a fish tank or a dog to take care of, but especially plants.
[01:15:20.669 --> 01:15:31.555]  We release hormones, it's been shown, that calm us when we're out in the garden with the bees and the sunflowers and the watermelons and just everything.
[01:15:31.555 --> 01:15:34.436]  It's so much fun to do this.
[01:15:34.436 --> 01:15:37.238]  It's a normal human agrarian activity.
[01:15:37.238 --> 01:15:39.619]  And there's the Ron Finley Project.
[01:15:39.619 --> 01:15:44.442]  Here I was saying, copy Johnny Appleseed, and then Nico a few months ago said, have you heard about this guy in the LA Times and places?
[01:15:45.222 --> 01:16:04.050]  Who they've tried to arrest and fine and fee because he dares to go into these, you know, government lots with weeds everywhere and plant stuff and then other people get involved and they start planting and then they start demanding, hey, we want part of this city park that nobody uses for a city garden.
[01:16:04.050 --> 01:16:06.011]  And next they're going to want chickens in their backyards.
[01:16:06.011 --> 01:16:08.492]  Next they're going to want to be independent humans.
[01:16:08.492 --> 01:16:10.812]  See, the globalists don't want us to be self-sufficient.
[01:16:10.812 --> 01:16:11.693]  This is the essence
[01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:14.678]  of the plantation.
[01:16:14.678 --> 01:16:18.343]  The essence of the reservation is you can't be self-sufficient.
[01:16:18.343 --> 01:16:20.045]  And that's the plan.
[01:16:20.045 --> 01:16:20.766]  RonFinley.com
[01:16:23.616 --> 01:16:28.280]  Very, very, crowdrise.com, Ron Finley HQ.
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.681]  Very exciting what Ron's doing.
[01:16:29.681 --> 01:16:34.826]  I mean, this guy is just over the top with the success he's had, but also the persecution.
[01:16:34.826 --> 01:16:38.089]  To show you, we're not in Kansas anymore, folks.
[01:16:38.089 --> 01:16:43.093]  When they said they had victory gardens in World War II, now they come after you.
[01:16:43.093 --> 01:16:48.878]  Ron, thank you for sitting there during that long babbling introduction, but something like you're doing is so amazing, my friend.
[01:16:50.305 --> 01:16:51.006]  Thank you.
[01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:53.487]  Thank you so much for having me here, Alex.
[01:16:53.487 --> 01:16:54.388]  I appreciate it.
[01:16:54.388 --> 01:16:57.490]  And what you're what you're saying is so correct, man.
[01:16:57.490 --> 01:16:59.372]  This is so on point.
[01:16:59.372 --> 01:17:09.419]  And so, I mean, it's basically, you know, it's like slavery, man, for all of us, you know, because, you know, they control the food, they control you.
[01:17:09.419 --> 01:17:11.921]  And we're trying to redesign that system.
[01:17:13.082 --> 01:17:14.263]  It's a total revolution.
[01:17:14.263 --> 01:17:19.746]  If everybody started planting gardens in their areas and learned what you could do with rooftops, well you're the expert.
[01:17:19.746 --> 01:17:21.006]  Tell us about this revolution.
[01:17:21.006 --> 01:17:23.087]  What got you started?
[01:17:23.087 --> 01:17:25.869]  See, everybody says that.
[01:17:25.869 --> 01:17:27.169]  I'm not an expert.
[01:17:27.169 --> 01:17:28.390]  I'm a fashion designer.
[01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:29.931]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:17:29.931 --> 01:17:36.634]  I'm just some guy that decided to put a carrot, you know, in the ground and all hell broke loose.
[01:17:36.634 --> 01:17:38.315]  But you are an expert by taking action.
[01:17:39.881 --> 01:17:42.543]  I mean, that's what makes you an expert is that you've actually done it.
[01:17:42.543 --> 01:17:45.866]  I mean, come on.
[01:17:45.866 --> 01:17:48.128]  But I mean, we're all experts.
[01:17:48.128 --> 01:17:49.149]  Alex, we're all experts.
[01:17:49.149 --> 01:17:50.730]  This is in all of us.
[01:17:50.730 --> 01:17:52.631]  This is in all of us, man.
[01:17:52.631 --> 01:17:53.572]  It is that.
[01:17:53.572 --> 01:17:55.033]  It's just doing something.
[01:17:55.033 --> 01:18:02.500]  And like you said about your children, man, if you put them out there, they're learning a life skill.
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.161]  This is not frivolous.
[01:18:04.261 --> 01:18:08.604]  You know, this is something that they can take with them and we'll take with them the rest of their life.
[01:18:08.604 --> 01:18:17.009]  But we have these these areas that I call them food prisons, they call them food deserts, that these kids have no skin in the game.
[01:18:17.009 --> 01:18:20.451]  Their whole life has been predestined for them.
[01:18:20.451 --> 01:18:24.673]  They don't they don't have any kind of they don't they don't even dream, man.
[01:18:24.673 --> 01:18:30.997]  It's sad talking to some of these kids and they don't know they already are born with barcodes on the back of their neck.
[01:18:31.497 --> 01:18:32.478]  I want to talk about you.
[01:18:32.478 --> 01:18:34.719]  We're going to break in a moment, but I want to come back and give you the floor.
[01:18:34.719 --> 01:18:45.166]  Talk about your awakening, how this started, and then how you got attacked, and from what I've seen, that backfired and made it even bigger.
[01:18:45.166 --> 01:18:46.067]  Okay.
[01:18:46.067 --> 01:18:48.348]  We're going to break in about a minute, but I mean, how did this get started?
[01:18:48.348 --> 01:18:56.554]  Well, basically, I remember going to the store, and there was a tomato, and it says,
[01:18:59.202 --> 01:19:01.523]  Maybe coated with shellac.
[01:19:01.523 --> 01:19:04.145]  And I was like, wow, shellac on my tomato?
[01:19:04.145 --> 01:19:09.288]  Isn't that what we put on wood in woodshop when I was in grade school?
[01:19:09.288 --> 01:19:16.952]  And you just start looking and you just open your eyes one day and you're like, wow.
[01:19:16.952 --> 01:19:19.374]  And you go to other cities, you go to other places.
[01:19:20.054 --> 01:19:22.937]  And you realize that all this is by design.
[01:19:22.937 --> 01:19:37.189]  This bad food, these, like you talk, the medical-industrial complex, the prison-industrial complex, the military-industrial complex, and you realize, like, wow, these kids are on a track to go absolutely nowhere.
[01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:38.910]  But, you know, to... Amazing.
[01:19:38.910 --> 01:19:43.595]  So it all started with a tomato, with shellac, that'll give you kidney failure, in your face.
[01:19:44.315 --> 01:19:45.736]  Ron Finley, ronfinley.com.
[01:19:45.736 --> 01:19:47.797]  We're going to come back and talk about your story.
[01:19:47.797 --> 01:19:48.837]  It's simply incredible.
[01:19:48.837 --> 01:19:52.940]  Then we're going to get into how folks can get involved and stop these food prisons.
[01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:54.520]  This is true revolution.
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:55.901]  Peaceful revolution.
[01:19:55.901 --> 01:19:57.222]  The magic of plants.
[01:19:58.735 --> 01:20:08.482]  So Mark and I are out at the range shooting our AR-15 rifles built from AR-15 kits from Guns80.com when Dave walks up and he says, Hey, did you guys hear about Jade Helm?
[01:20:08.482 --> 01:20:14.606]  You know, the government doesn't care about the Fosse Comitatus Act and Jade Helm, the troops are going to come and they may come after us and blah, blah, blah.
[01:20:14.606 --> 01:20:17.788]  And I'm thinking, Oh my God, dude, look, I take a 30 shot magazine.
[01:20:17.788 --> 01:20:21.150]  I put it in my AR-15 built from a kit from Guns80.com.
[01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:22.511]  I unload it on the target.
[01:20:22.511 --> 01:20:23.351]  Jade Helm?
[01:20:23.351 --> 01:20:24.192]  I mean, really?
[01:20:24.192 --> 01:20:24.772]  Guns80.com.
[01:20:24.772 --> 01:20:25.413]  Guns80.com.
[01:20:25.413 --> 01:20:25.873]  Guns80.com.
[01:20:25.873 --> 01:20:26.233]  Go now.
[01:20:28.875 --> 01:20:35.539]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:20:35.539 --> 01:20:43.664]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:20:43.664 --> 01:20:51.489]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:20:51.829 --> 01:20:56.911]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:20:56.911 --> 01:21:02.132]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:02.132 --> 01:21:06.474]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:06.474 --> 01:21:07.574]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:07.574 --> 01:21:12.076]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[01:21:28.004 --> 01:21:36.110]  There are hundreds of silver products on the market today, but there's nothing like the astonishing health benefits of the multi-patented One Silver Solution.
[01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:40.673]  Boost your immune system at a great price with our Silver Solution liquid, starting at $12.95 a bottle.

[01:21:55.038 --> 01:21:57.239]  There is only one silver solution.
[01:21:58.902 --> 01:22:01.204]  The folks at My Patriot Supply get it.
[01:22:01.204 --> 01:22:05.567]  They know the world can be unpredictable, and there are some scary things happening right now.
[01:22:05.567 --> 01:22:13.172]  The only way we can make sure we maintain our independence, despite the situation, is to take control and get prepared.
[01:22:13.172 --> 01:22:17.355]  They've come up with a deal that will help you get prepared for anything.

[01:22:40.554 --> 01:22:41.274]  Call 800-274-3070 right now.

[01:22:52.023 --> 01:22:57.326]  274-3070 to claim yours while supplies last.
[01:22:57.326 --> 01:22:58.487]  Attention taxpayers!
[01:22:58.487 --> 01:23:01.428]  If you've received a notice from the IRS or state, do not ignore it.
[01:23:01.428 --> 01:23:04.269]  It's also a big mistake to try and handle your tax problem on your own.
[01:23:04.269 --> 01:23:11.033]  If you owe back taxes, it's a fact that the government has the power to take everything you own, including your home, business, wages, savings, and your freedom.
[01:23:11.033 --> 01:23:12.153]  But here's the good news.
[01:23:12.153 --> 01:23:14.895]  There's a special toll-free tax hotline set up especially for you.
[01:23:14.895 --> 01:23:19.577]  This tax hotline will tell you about new programs that are geared to help you dramatically settle, reduce, or eliminate what you owe.
[01:23:19.957 --> 01:23:20.778]  You have to call now.
[01:23:20.778 --> 01:23:25.024]  Take down this number or put it in your cell phone, but call 877-345-7645.
[01:23:25.024 --> 01:23:29.390]  That's 877-345-7645.
[01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:34.177]  When you call, you get free information on how you can reduce or eliminate back taxes, including penalties and interest.
[01:23:34.177 --> 01:23:37.361]  You can also be helped if you have unfiled returns, a tax lien, wage garnishment,
[01:23:37.501 --> 01:23:38.241]  Don't know much about this
[01:24:07.389 --> 01:24:20.341]  Don't know much biology Don't know much about a science book Don't know much about the French I took But I do know that I learned
[01:24:26.934 --> 01:24:29.356]  I have good will towards people.
[01:24:29.356 --> 01:24:34.519]  And the system wants to eradicate that because free will gets in the way of the corporatist program.
[01:24:34.519 --> 01:24:46.728]  The reason I get so excited about city gardening, but also rural gardening, truck farms, you name it, is that everything the social engineers are doing, as our guest said, is about ending that.
[01:24:47.759 --> 01:24:59.812]  He's agreed to show us for the whole hour, so at about 40 after, I'm going to give the number out, we're going to take some calls about your stories of city gardening or articles you want to talk about where people get in trouble for gardening in their front yard or their backyard.
[01:24:59.812 --> 01:25:06.799]  This is a real attempt to intimidate people, but if we start doing this, it can circumvent the Monsanto tyranny, all of it.
[01:25:06.799 --> 01:25:09.222]  Remember, they just cut the fluoride in the water in half this week.
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:11.681]  We're having major victories.
[01:25:11.681 --> 01:25:14.043]  McDonald's is starting to take the GMO out.
[01:25:14.043 --> 01:25:16.705]  We're having victories with our actions.
[01:25:16.705 --> 01:25:23.230]  And plants, seeds, are so magic that you can plant a little seed and a whole mustard tree grows.
[01:25:23.230 --> 01:25:25.392]  You can have mustard for 20 years from it.
[01:25:25.392 --> 01:25:31.116]  Or you can plant a seed and a pecan tree grows, or an apple tree, or strawberries.
[01:25:31.116 --> 01:25:33.378]  I mean, this is nanotech.
[01:25:33.378 --> 01:25:34.359]  God's nanotech.
[01:25:34.359 --> 01:25:38.983]  I'm going to shut up because this is a short segment, long segment coming up with Ron Finley, ronfinley.com.
[01:25:39.343 --> 01:25:40.944]  I know you don't like talking about yourself during the break.
[01:25:40.944 --> 01:25:42.385]  You're like, I don't want to brag about myself.
[01:25:42.385 --> 01:25:48.369]  Talk about your story, what you've done in L.A., the thousands you've inspired, but also the persecution you went through.
[01:25:48.369 --> 01:25:50.330]  So you see this tomato with shellac.
[01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:51.771]  That begins the wheels going.
[01:25:51.771 --> 01:25:52.672]  Tell people your story.
[01:25:53.817 --> 01:26:03.965]  Well, I mean, it was the tomato with shellac, Alex, but it was also, I mean, that was just like almost the tipping point or the, you know, the straw.
[01:26:03.965 --> 01:26:10.110]  And you just look around and all of a sudden you realize that all you see is asphalt and concrete.
[01:26:10.110 --> 01:26:13.673]  And my whole thing, like you was saying, I don't want my food loco.
[01:26:14.193 --> 01:26:15.795]  I want my food hyper-loco.
[01:26:15.795 --> 01:26:28.169]  You know, why in this desert that we live in in California, why are we watering grass when you can use the less water and water and grow food?
[01:26:28.169 --> 01:26:30.632]  Which is what we need here.
[01:26:30.632 --> 01:26:32.514]  Why aren't yards full of all this beautiful food?
[01:26:33.675 --> 01:26:34.295]  Right, exactly.
[01:26:34.295 --> 01:26:47.502]  Well, I mean, what happened with my story, you know, after I got persecuted, you know, had to go to court the first time, I decided years later, I thought they forgot about it and I did it again.
[01:26:47.502 --> 01:26:54.225]  And so, basically got thrown under the bus again and... Tell folks what you did, though.
[01:26:54.225 --> 01:26:55.526]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:26:55.526 --> 01:26:56.747]  Were you planning what they did?
[01:26:57.642 --> 01:27:03.126]  The plant, we have these in front of the, they're called parkways.
[01:27:03.126 --> 01:27:10.610]  It's like right before you get to the street, that strip of land, you know, strip of grass, like in these pictures, I'm standing in the street.
[01:27:10.610 --> 01:27:12.572]  So I decided to just
[01:27:13.212 --> 01:27:13.633]  We're good.
[01:27:30.347 --> 01:27:34.749]  I wanted to smell lavender and jasmine and rosemary.
[01:27:34.749 --> 01:27:36.690]  So that's where it started.
[01:27:36.690 --> 01:27:40.132]  And so then I started, and then it came down again.
[01:27:40.132 --> 01:27:43.293]  Long story short, I took 150 feet by nine, 10 feet, and I made a food forest.
[01:27:50.196 --> 01:27:57.302]  That I wanted my neighbors basically to see, look, you can design your own life and you can start here.
[01:27:57.302 --> 01:27:59.403]  I use it as a canvas.
[01:27:59.403 --> 01:28:01.345]  I use the soil, Alex.
[01:28:01.345 --> 01:28:03.426]  This is my street art.
[01:28:03.426 --> 01:28:04.627]  This is my graffiti.
[01:28:04.627 --> 01:28:05.588]  And that's how I treat it.
[01:28:05.588 --> 01:28:07.149]  But also, it beautifies.
[01:28:07.689 --> 01:28:16.153]  It purifies, and it's all, you're cleaning the air, you're bringing in pollinators, you're bringing in all kinds of insects, and you're feeding people.
[01:28:16.153 --> 01:28:25.277]  But also, it's multi-layered, because people pass by, and like you were saying, they see these flowers, they see this, it's color therapy, Alex.
[01:28:25.277 --> 01:28:25.737]  You know?
[01:28:25.737 --> 01:28:27.378]  It ups the value of the neighborhood, too.
[01:28:28.268 --> 01:28:29.428]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:28:29.428 --> 01:28:32.929]  And in that, it changes people's perspective.
[01:28:32.929 --> 01:28:34.250]  It changes their mind.
[01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:35.590]  People are smiling.
[01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:40.411]  And you're having conversations that you would never have had.
[01:28:40.411 --> 01:28:42.392]  You're also a really good gardener.
[01:28:42.392 --> 01:28:44.733]  I've looked at photos in the news about you and your own site.
[01:28:44.733 --> 01:28:45.633]  You've got a green thumb.
[01:28:47.427 --> 01:28:51.690]  I got green hands, Alex.
[01:28:51.690 --> 01:28:53.250]  Not just my thumbs, you know.
[01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:59.134]  But I want people, I put it on the street because I want people to realize you can do this.
[01:28:59.134 --> 01:29:01.235]  You know, treat this like your canvas.
[01:29:01.235 --> 01:29:03.156]  And people like ask me, well, where do you start?
[01:29:03.156 --> 01:29:04.296]  I'm like, at the beginning.
[01:29:04.296 --> 01:29:05.217]  And they're like, where's that?
[01:29:05.217 --> 01:29:06.537]  I said, wherever you start.
[01:29:06.537 --> 01:29:11.200]  When you get a canvas, you decide where you're going to put that first brush stroke.
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:14.802]  It could start with a box plant with some peppers and tomatoes in your window.
[01:29:15.734 --> 01:29:20.357]  And that one tomato plant and pepper plant's gonna have so much food, you're gonna, I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:29:20.357 --> 01:29:23.059]  Every week, they're, look, we have no culture.
[01:29:23.059 --> 01:29:29.804]  They've taken our culture, the most human culture is agrarian, and you are a revolutionary taking back our culture.
[01:29:29.804 --> 01:29:31.285]  I'm gonna get your take on that.
[01:29:31.285 --> 01:29:35.548]  Ron Finley, a true revolutionary, ronfinley.com, an example to everybody.
[01:29:35.548 --> 01:29:38.230]  Straight ahead, on the other side, I'm gonna open the phones up, but...
[01:29:39.304 --> 01:29:45.653]  I mean, they had arrest warrants out, they fined him, they came after him, but it blew up in their face and now they've had to capitulate.
[01:29:45.653 --> 01:29:47.956]  It's a victory story.
[01:29:47.956 --> 01:29:49.358]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.358 --> 01:29:51.882]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.882 --> 01:29:54.566]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:00.441]  New claims made by ISIS.
[01:30:00.441 --> 01:30:06.467]  The terror group says they have 71 soldiers trained in 15 different states ready to attack any target they desire.
[01:30:06.467 --> 01:30:10.210]  The post also claims 23 soldiers have signed up for missions like Sunday.
[01:30:10.210 --> 01:30:17.516]  A reference to the attack in Garland, Texas that resulted in the wounding of a security guard and the killing of the two attackers by a single police officer with a sidearm.
[01:30:17.956 --> 01:30:20.897]  ISIS claims their target and Sunday's attack was Pamela Geller.
[01:30:20.897 --> 01:30:28.040]  Abu Ibrahim said in the post, we don't care what land she hides in or what sky shields her, we will send all of our lines to achieve her slaughter.
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:38.565]  Geller heads the group responsible for the Draw Muhammad event in Garland, Texas, which is part of a larger network of neocon organizations working behind the scenes to stoke tensions between Muslims, Christians, and Jews.
[01:30:38.565 --> 01:30:43.067]  She responded, this threat illustrates the savagery and barbarism of the Islamic State.
[01:30:43.067 --> 01:30:45.588]  They want me dead for violating Sharia blasphemy laws.
[01:30:45.908 --> 01:30:53.554]  What remains to be seen is whether the free world will wake up and stand for the freedom of speech, or instead, kowtow to this evil and continue to denounce me.

[01:30:55.736 --> 01:30:56.437]  Rob Due reporting.

[01:31:28.462 --> 01:31:29.483]  Alex Jones here.
[01:31:29.483 --> 01:31:38.767]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:31:38.767 --> 01:31:42.569]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[01:31:53.255 --> 01:31:54.255]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:58.257 --> 01:32:05.461]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[01:32:15.086 --> 01:32:23.111]  You don't have to be a doctor to know the fall and winter months are the most dangerous time of year in North America when it comes to you and your family's health.

[01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:53.240]  Silver Bullet.
[01:33:08.453 --> 01:33:14.515]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[01:33:14.515 --> 01:33:19.517]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[01:33:19.517 --> 01:33:24.378]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life!
[01:33:24.378 --> 01:33:26.359]  It's not about food.
[01:33:26.359 --> 01:33:28.920]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[01:33:35.623 --> 01:33:37.772]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:37.772 --> 01:33:40.703]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:43.120]  That's right.
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:51.286]  Both political parties in this country work for the very same corporate interests that are anti-human liberty and want to centralize things.
[01:33:51.286 --> 01:33:55.329]  Good news though, NSA phone data collection illegal appeals court rules.
[01:33:55.329 --> 01:33:57.350]  It's out of the New York Times.
[01:33:57.350 --> 01:34:00.792]  I'm going to cover that starting in the next hour in more detail.
[01:34:00.792 --> 01:34:08.297]  We're going to open the phones up here in about 10 minutes for your stories about gardening, any persecution you've gone through, any positive stories.
[01:34:08.297 --> 01:34:12.260]  But there is a war on just normal human activity, on human self-sufficiency.
[01:34:13.601 --> 01:34:18.305]  We had 90% of people somewhat self-sufficient and rural in the Great Depression.
[01:34:18.305 --> 01:34:20.286]  Now we're 90% urban.
[01:34:20.286 --> 01:34:22.448]  Only half the rural self-sufficient.
[01:34:22.448 --> 01:34:25.150]  We've gone from 90% to 5%.
[01:34:25.150 --> 01:34:27.192]  That's a crisis situation.
[01:34:27.192 --> 01:34:34.418]  That's why we help fund our own operations selling high-quality heirloom non-GMO seeds at InfoWareStore.com at the InfoWare Seed Center.
[01:34:35.635 --> 01:34:52.524]  And I mean, we've got it across the board, ladies and gentlemen, the Survival Seed Vaults, the Survival Arc, the top eight companies, the lowest prices, Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, and your purchase of the products helps fund our operation.
[01:34:52.524 --> 01:34:59.827]  Now is the time in the late spring, summer, fall, to start planting, to get good at it, to find out what grows well in your areas.
[01:34:59.827 --> 01:35:00.768]  It's a real adventure.
[01:35:01.923 --> 01:35:10.952]  But even if it's just planting sunflowers and then, you know, eating those, it brings in the hummingbirds, it brings in the bees, it just... Gardens are so entertaining.
[01:35:10.952 --> 01:35:14.916]  I mean, they're just a great place to hang out and, you know, have lunch or dinner.
[01:35:14.916 --> 01:35:16.118]  They're just wonderful.
[01:35:16.118 --> 01:35:17.159]  And I've always been a gardener.
[01:35:17.159 --> 01:35:19.361]  I don't have time to do it because I'm too busy on the air all the time.
[01:35:19.361 --> 01:35:21.343]  I need to get back to that.
[01:35:21.343 --> 01:35:23.465]  But, again, Infowarslife.com.
[01:35:23.465 --> 01:35:24.766]  We're also, for Mother's Day,
[01:35:25.871 --> 01:35:32.197]  Speaking of what comes from plants, concentrated herbal extracts known to supercharge endurance, libido, energy.
[01:35:32.197 --> 01:35:36.400]  You've heard the right reviews for Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:38.823]  Super Female has been sold out for almost three months.
[01:35:38.823 --> 01:35:41.065]  We now have a limited supply back in.
[01:35:41.065 --> 01:35:47.330]  It's a different formula than the Super Male and you've heard the right reviews.
[01:35:47.330 --> 01:35:48.852]  Great gift for Mother's Day to give your
[01:35:49.966 --> 01:35:54.128]  Mom or give your wife or to give your girlfriend.
[01:35:54.128 --> 01:35:55.829]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:35:55.829 --> 01:35:58.470]  Super Female Vitality is back in stock.
[01:35:58.470 --> 01:36:03.692]  The premier high quality non-GMO concentrated extracts.
[01:36:03.692 --> 01:36:05.273]  Again, Infowarslife.com.
[01:36:05.273 --> 01:36:07.274]  Okay, Ron Finley, ronfinley.com.
[01:36:08.414 --> 01:36:10.636]  Get more into what you've done since then.
[01:36:10.636 --> 01:36:13.418]  I was reading the news, other people have picked up on it.
[01:36:13.418 --> 01:36:21.585]  There are other community garden programs around the country, but usually the government says, here's the spot, you can do it, far removed, away from people's homes.
[01:36:21.585 --> 01:36:23.326]  Really, before we go to calls, at 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:36:23.326 --> 01:36:26.108]  Before we do that, you've got the floor for the next ten minutes.
[01:36:26.108 --> 01:36:26.449]  Give us a speech.
[01:36:26.449 --> 01:36:29.251]  Tell us where you stand, what you've done, where this is going.
[01:36:37.765 --> 01:36:46.371]  Right now, Alex, the law has been changed in Los Angeles where you can now plant edibles on your parkway in front of your house.
[01:36:46.371 --> 01:36:47.692]  Awesome.
[01:36:47.692 --> 01:36:50.293]  The mayor signed it last month.
[01:36:50.293 --> 01:36:53.095]  So, I mean, it is, it's a big victory.
[01:36:53.095 --> 01:36:55.517]  And like you said, yeah, the parkways are cool.
[01:36:55.517 --> 01:36:58.699]  If you put them together, that's acres and acres and acres of space.
[01:36:58.699 --> 01:37:01.080]  But I want some of these vacant lots, man.
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:04.563]  I want people to be able to walk outside of their house.
[01:37:05.944 --> 01:37:08.805]  And be able to engage with their community.
[01:37:08.805 --> 01:37:11.527]  Gardens build communities, period.
[01:37:11.527 --> 01:37:16.649]  And like you said, man, people ask me what I do, and I'm like, I change culture.
[01:37:16.649 --> 01:37:18.030]  That's what I do.
[01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:19.391]  And that's what we have to do, man.
[01:37:19.391 --> 01:37:23.073]  We have to get back to being self-sufficient.
[01:37:23.073 --> 01:37:27.095]  People ask me, why you call it gangster?
[01:37:27.095 --> 01:37:28.936]  I said, this is gangster.
[01:37:28.936 --> 01:37:31.097]  You want to know what true gangster is?
[01:37:31.097 --> 01:37:32.278]  It's being self-sufficient.
[01:37:32.398 --> 01:37:33.959]  It's building your community.
[01:37:33.959 --> 01:37:37.180]  It's not tearing it down.
[01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:39.060]  It's educating.
[01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:40.081]  It's helping people.
[01:37:40.081 --> 01:37:43.782]  I got a hashtag.
[01:37:43.782 --> 01:37:46.443]  Real gangsters grow food.
[01:37:46.443 --> 01:37:49.964]  Real G's grow flowers.
[01:37:49.964 --> 01:37:52.205]  That's true to me, man.
[01:37:52.205 --> 01:37:53.926]  All the lessons are in the soil.
[01:37:54.206 --> 01:37:54.406]  You know,
[01:38:09.586 --> 01:38:10.467]  Alex Jones Show!
[01:38:34.059 --> 01:38:39.005]  It gives you fruit year after year after year after year.
[01:38:39.005 --> 01:38:41.628]  We have to look at things different.
[01:38:41.628 --> 01:38:45.413]  Even our so-called waste, Alex, we have to look at different.
[01:38:45.413 --> 01:38:50.018]  I tell people, people think leaves are debris and it's a pain and it's trash.
[01:38:50.018 --> 01:38:52.741]  I'm like, no, leaves are a resource.
[01:38:53.562 --> 01:38:56.846]  You know, a leaf falls for a reason in a particular season.
[01:38:56.846 --> 01:38:58.227]  That's by design.
[01:38:58.227 --> 01:39:05.736]  You know, and we need to stop trying to change Mother Earth's design and do biomimicry and mimic what she's doing.
[01:39:05.736 --> 01:39:07.758]  Because who gardens in a forest, Alex?
[01:39:08.829 --> 01:39:09.950]  If nobody.
[01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:13.535]  So how the hell do we have 350 foot trees?
[01:39:13.535 --> 01:39:14.095]  You know?
[01:39:14.095 --> 01:39:17.600]  Because that's, because it's a divine plan and that's what happens.
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:26.250]  It's an incredible, it's magic and all the synergy and the harmony and absolutely, you know, when I had children my brain clicked and I
[01:39:27.245 --> 01:39:27.525]  All right.
[01:39:47.085 --> 01:39:51.109]  It means you need a garden.
[01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:53.812]  You know, it becomes your solace.
[01:39:53.812 --> 01:39:55.674]  And that's what I tell people, man.
[01:39:55.674 --> 01:39:57.736]  The soil seduces you.
[01:39:57.736 --> 01:39:58.777]  I mean, period.
[01:39:58.777 --> 01:40:00.960]  And you got to think that's where we come from.
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:02.341]  That's what we are, man.
[01:40:02.341 --> 01:40:08.067]  And I'm trying to just get people back into where you can design your own life.
[01:40:08.067 --> 01:40:09.609]  I talk to kids, Alex, they don't dream.
[01:40:10.309 --> 01:40:17.278]  You know, and that bothers me, because a dream is free, but you got people's minds to the point that they don't even dream?
[01:40:17.278 --> 01:40:19.620]  That's control, and I'm trying to break that.
[01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:36.053]  Watching these incredibly unhappy rich people, because I know a bunch of them, thinking that they aren't adequate and they've got to follow what this is saying.
[01:40:36.053 --> 01:40:38.473]  We're being farmed by the corporatists.
[01:40:38.473 --> 01:40:44.035]  It's time to get out of that system, get outside, and start doing this.
[01:40:44.035 --> 01:40:51.578]  I mean, it really is in my gut, but also intellectually, I know this is one of the keys to really overturning this system peacefully.
[01:40:51.578 --> 01:40:53.738]  Because they sell us on violent revolutions as a way to go.
[01:40:53.738 --> 01:40:55.379]  Well, that's because they can win that every day.
[01:40:55.859 --> 01:41:08.725]  But a velvet revolution of culture, of art, of food, of literature, of gardening, that's something the system can't beat because it's so innately human, you just do it, as you were saying, and everybody comes.
[01:41:08.725 --> 01:41:09.766]  You don't have to sell anything.
[01:41:10.731 --> 01:41:11.051]  No.
[01:41:11.051 --> 01:41:15.815]  And you know, I had some folks here, they did a march against Monsanto.
[01:41:15.815 --> 01:41:20.118]  And I'm like, and people are like, Ron, everyone was expecting you to be at the march.
[01:41:20.118 --> 01:41:22.419]  And I'm like, why were they expecting me to be there?
[01:41:22.419 --> 01:41:27.843]  I'm like, I didn't, I mean, hey, Monsanto don't really care about you guys marching.
[01:41:27.843 --> 01:41:30.045]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:41:30.045 --> 01:41:32.346]  All the thousand or however many people was there.
[01:41:32.346 --> 01:41:33.447]  I said, you know what I did?
[01:41:33.447 --> 01:41:37.430]  I had that day, I had 60 people putting in a garden.
[01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:38.451]  So now imagine,
[01:41:39.171 --> 01:41:43.134]  If you had all those people that were marching and doing that, which is cool.
[01:41:43.134 --> 01:41:44.375]  I mean, people need to march.
[01:41:44.375 --> 01:41:49.478]  But just imagine, Alex, if that energy went into all those people putting in gardens.
[01:41:49.478 --> 01:41:51.560]  I mean, there's your fight against Monsanto.
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:51.800]  Exactly.
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:52.581]  That's what I always say.
[01:41:52.581 --> 01:41:53.401]  Vote with your dollars.
[01:41:53.401 --> 01:41:54.582]  Vote with your action.
[01:41:54.582 --> 01:42:05.350]  If the 10,000 great people that marched in almost every city, like 10,000 in Austin, even more I know in other areas, if they all went and put in a garden or a plant, that would overturn Monsanto in a year.
[01:42:06.190 --> 01:42:10.734]  I mean, there'd be so much fresh non-GMO food everywhere, it'd be crazy.
[01:42:10.734 --> 01:42:13.657]  And what are they going to do, SWAT team us for growing tomatoes?
[01:42:13.657 --> 01:42:17.980]  I mean, we're that close if people just get into this.
[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:22.164]  No, that's one of the jokes I tell about my garden, you know.
[01:42:22.164 --> 01:42:29.330]  I said, all of a sudden, you know, I plant a tomato, and next thing I know, you know, we got a black guy planting a tomato.
[01:42:29.330 --> 01:42:30.551]  OK, we're going to need backup.
[01:42:32.156 --> 01:42:33.297]  You know, it was like that.
[01:42:33.297 --> 01:42:37.439]  You know, they call SWAT because you know, hey, he's got cabbage on his street.
[01:42:37.439 --> 01:42:39.480]  You know, we gotta do something about that.
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:40.781]  It's ridiculous, man.
[01:42:40.781 --> 01:42:44.543]  And we gotta break these slave chains.
[01:42:44.543 --> 01:42:46.644]  And I ain't talking, I'm talking about everybody.
[01:42:46.644 --> 01:42:52.587]  Because they own our food, they control our food, so therefore they control us.
[01:42:52.587 --> 01:42:56.869]  Well, looking at it, they've been waging war against the American farmer for 70, 80 years.
[01:42:56.869 --> 01:42:58.290]  These robber barons know what they're doing.
[01:42:59.648 --> 01:43:00.289]  Yeah.
[01:43:00.289 --> 01:43:05.774]  And the thing about it, they're depleting all the resources from the soil to the water while they're doing it.
[01:43:05.774 --> 01:43:11.320]  And they're creating all these super bugs and super weeds, you know, because of the toxic sprays.
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:14.543]  And everything is a new rare cancer now.
[01:43:14.543 --> 01:43:16.825]  Every day you go, oh, she has a rare cancer.
[01:43:16.825 --> 01:43:19.948]  I was about to say, I've studied this architecture of this evil.
[01:43:20.914 --> 01:43:23.796]  It's so hard to be as evil as they are.
[01:43:23.796 --> 01:43:27.719]  I mean, how did they come up with something... They were so good then, Alex!
[01:43:27.719 --> 01:43:29.540]  They what?
[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:31.182]  How did they do it so well then?
[01:43:31.182 --> 01:43:34.564]  Yeah, no, I'm saying, they're just so... I mean, they are so evil.
[01:43:34.564 --> 01:43:36.545]  I mean, when you really study them, they know what they're doing.
[01:43:36.545 --> 01:43:39.388]  I mean, they... These are some smooth operators.
[01:43:39.388 --> 01:43:42.129]  That's one of those, don't hate the player, hate the game kind of thing.
[01:43:42.129 --> 01:43:45.292]  Because they know that if we can do what they do as good,
[01:43:46.124 --> 01:43:47.025]  As they do.
[01:43:47.025 --> 01:43:50.028]  I mean, oh man, the world would be a beautiful place.
[01:43:50.028 --> 01:43:54.712]  But my word has spread literally, Alex, around the world.
[01:43:54.712 --> 01:43:58.575]  I mean, from North Korea to Africa, man.
[01:43:58.575 --> 01:44:02.919]  I've spoken in Qatar and Oman and Greece.
[01:44:02.919 --> 01:44:08.024]  And I got a garden named after me in Brussels, UK.
[01:44:08.024 --> 01:44:08.344]  So
[01:44:10.666 --> 01:44:25.310]  I was about to say, you are a testament to one man or one woman, one human, taking action, not thinking it'd be big, not doing it to be Mr. Cool, already successful in your own right, and it just resonated and is already changing the world.
[01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:29.091]  That is the microcosm, the archetype, of what will defeat the system.
[01:44:29.912 --> 01:44:36.357]  And I mean, the thing about with me, Alex, I am the... I wasn't even trying.
[01:44:36.357 --> 01:44:42.081]  I tell people I'm the most reluctant anarchist... Not an activist.
[01:44:42.081 --> 01:44:45.243]  Not saying you're an anarchist against the corporate system.
[01:44:45.243 --> 01:44:46.244]  Organic anarchy.
[01:44:47.084 --> 01:44:47.685]  Anarchist.
[01:44:47.685 --> 01:44:51.208]  You know, my card says head troublemaker, you know?
[01:44:51.208 --> 01:44:53.269]  But I mean, none of this was planned, Alex.
[01:44:53.269 --> 01:45:11.624]  So if I could do this without the plan, without the blueprint, and where I have guys talking about me on the news in Brazil, you know, where they took over a lot outside their apartment building, now they're taking over another lot because it's so successful, man.
[01:45:11.624 --> 01:45:13.946]  That's what I want to hear, man.
[01:45:13.946 --> 01:45:16.088]  I call it life revolution.
[01:45:16.488 --> 01:45:20.192]  Spreading life, getting aggressive.
[01:45:20.192 --> 01:45:21.814]  Yeah, man, I tell you it's exciting what you're doing.
[01:45:21.814 --> 01:45:28.921]  I want to take a few phone calls, but ronfinley.com, people can go there, they can see what you've done, they can augment it, do their own thing.
[01:45:28.921 --> 01:45:31.885]  I just want to challenge everybody today, this is the season to do it.
[01:45:31.885 --> 01:45:35.548]  Start planning, even though it's just some sunflowers, some tomatoes, some peppers.
[01:45:36.369 --> 01:45:50.418]  Whatever it is you're into, I mean, if you live on the West Coast or areas that are good, you know, plant some grapes, plant some tomatoes, plant some lemons, some limes, some whatever.
[01:45:50.418 --> 01:45:52.700]  It's just so exciting to do this.
[01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:56.482]  Ron Finley is our guest, changing the world by taking action.
[01:45:56.482 --> 01:45:57.823]  Just simply amazing.
[01:45:57.823 --> 01:46:01.886]  We've got Terrence, Renee, Joseph, Stephen, Ray, and many others.
[01:46:02.726 --> 01:46:06.527]  Let's go ahead and talk to Terrence first in California, in your neck of the woods.
[01:46:06.527 --> 01:46:21.432]  The guy we have on the line, Ron Finley of ronfinley.com, just got the second most populous city in North America, well I guess Mexico City is bigger than New York, so third most populous city in North America, to legalize planting food in the right-of-ways.
[01:46:21.432 --> 01:46:23.432]  How incredible is that?
[01:46:23.432 --> 01:46:25.913]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Terrence.
[01:46:25.913 --> 01:46:27.613]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[01:46:27.613 --> 01:46:29.914]  Pleasure to meet you, Ron and Alex.
[01:46:31.038 --> 01:46:32.419]  Ron, I got a question for you.
[01:46:32.419 --> 01:46:37.062]  What do you think about the geoengineering that's going on with the California drought?
[01:46:37.062 --> 01:46:57.016]  Alex had a guest on some time ago from StopTheCrime.net and she discusses different things about the Monsanto group purposely putting things into the clouds to prevent the rain while causing more rain and more devastation in the Midwest with their snowstorms and depriving us of our
[01:46:57.076 --> 01:47:01.482]  Well we know geoengineering is going on, but they classify what they're doing.
[01:47:01.482 --> 01:47:07.712]  Just like you mentioned super weeds, antibiotic resistant stuff from the chickens and everything else.
[01:47:07.712 --> 01:47:10.476]  Are you aware of the larger program of manipulating the weather?
[01:47:12.156 --> 01:47:14.018]  No, I mean, no.
[01:47:14.018 --> 01:47:15.739]  I mean, you see it though.
[01:47:15.739 --> 01:47:22.184]  I mean, it's funny because even guys that fly the planes, they, oh, those are, those are comm trails.
[01:47:22.184 --> 01:47:23.205]  That's every, yeah.
[01:47:23.205 --> 01:47:25.106]  Why are they in this pattern, dude?
[01:47:25.106 --> 01:47:30.771]  Why all of a sudden do they dissipate and they join together and all of a sudden we have this cloud cover?
[01:47:30.771 --> 01:47:32.733]  Um, it's, it's, um,
[01:47:35.535 --> 01:47:36.495]  I don't know.
[01:47:36.495 --> 01:47:44.358]  See here, it doesn't benefit California, which was one of the biggest agricultural states in the United States of America.
[01:47:44.358 --> 01:47:47.219]  They want to bankrupt the whole thing?
[01:47:47.219 --> 01:47:48.600]  Well, who's that going to benefit?
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:55.723]  That's not going to benefit the powers that be, the biggest landowners in this state, though, Alex.
[01:47:55.723 --> 01:48:01.405]  I mean, if their whole thing is about money, Alex, why would they want to bankrupt it?
[01:48:02.365 --> 01:48:04.307]  You just brought up the key point because it's beyond that.
[01:48:04.307 --> 01:48:08.011]  They've got the ultra-rich, but there's people above that that are long-term.
[01:48:08.011 --> 01:48:14.858]  Once they bankrupt it for a decade, they can come in and buy it all up and be the breadbasket for the next 200 years for all of North America.
[01:48:14.858 --> 01:48:17.161]  It's long-term players.
[01:48:17.161 --> 01:48:18.242]  Terrence, great question.
[01:48:18.242 --> 01:48:20.144]  Renee in South Dakota.
[01:48:20.144 --> 01:48:20.784]  You're on the air.
[01:48:20.784 --> 01:48:21.105]  Welcome.
[01:48:22.662 --> 01:48:26.884]  Well, I just want to say that in the 1920s, there were no grocery stores.
[01:48:26.884 --> 01:48:28.405]  So where was the groceries?
[01:48:28.405 --> 01:48:29.465]  It was in the gardens.
[01:48:29.465 --> 01:48:30.406]  It was in the homes.
[01:48:30.406 --> 01:48:31.366]  It was on the farms.
[01:48:31.366 --> 01:48:32.467]  It was all local.
[01:48:33.149 --> 01:48:33.229]  Wow.
[01:49:04.176 --> 01:49:06.918]  You got magic soil, Renee.
[01:49:06.918 --> 01:49:09.100]  Two feet in two weeks?
[01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:11.221]  That's crazy.
[01:49:11.221 --> 01:49:13.803]  Well, no, maybe it's been about three weeks.
[01:49:13.803 --> 01:49:17.446]  But I mean, really, I mean, I've been blessing my plants every day.
[01:49:17.446 --> 01:49:22.370]  And I mean, you know, they do respond.
[01:49:22.370 --> 01:49:27.154]  It's amazing just seeing the watermelon seeds come up and them sprouting out of the soil.
[01:49:27.154 --> 01:49:32.838]  And, you know, I throw a little cup of water on them each day in my windowsill.
[01:49:32.918 --> 01:49:34.359]  Well, it's what Ron said though.
[01:49:34.359 --> 01:49:40.902]  I love how you're out in your garden and a little hummingbird flies up right by your face and then winks at you and flies off.
[01:49:40.902 --> 01:49:44.144]  I mean, let me tell you, gardens are a lot better than watching TV.
[01:49:44.144 --> 01:49:46.625]  I mean, I'm here to tell you.
[01:49:46.625 --> 01:49:48.726]  No, literally you get seduced.
[01:49:48.726 --> 01:49:57.291]  I mean, I, you know, I've known I've gone out in the morning to watch stuff and all of a sudden it's four hours later when you were only supposed to be out there 20 minutes.
[01:49:57.771 --> 01:50:05.576]  You know, it becomes your solace, literally, and your meditation.
[01:50:05.576 --> 01:50:22.066]  On my parkway, I actually have seating that I made out of logs, man, and you can come and people are sitting out there having coffee, and I mean, the bottom line, if you build it, it's gonna, people... Well, it's been said that make art, make culture, that will defeat the globalist.
[01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:25.271]  Oh, totally, totally, totally.
[01:50:25.271 --> 01:50:38.375]  And that's what it's all about is showing people how creative they can be and giving them the ideas, man, because we have to show a lot of people that they have the ability to dream.
[01:50:38.375 --> 01:50:40.596]  You know, we have to show, look, look at this.
[01:50:40.596 --> 01:50:41.856]  You can dream about this.
[01:50:41.856 --> 01:50:43.497]  A lot of times people need help with that.
[01:50:43.717 --> 01:50:45.139]  And I mean, that's what I think we're here to do.
[01:50:45.139 --> 01:50:46.140]  And a garden is something you can do.
[01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:46.901]  You can dream it.
[01:50:46.901 --> 01:50:47.601]  You can grow it.
[01:50:47.601 --> 01:50:48.482]  You can have success.
[01:50:48.482 --> 01:50:49.544]  You can get better.
[01:50:49.544 --> 01:50:50.645]  It can build competency.
[01:50:50.645 --> 01:50:54.770]  This whole system is about making you think you have no power except through the system.
[01:50:54.770 --> 01:50:55.951]  Rene, thank you.
[01:50:55.951 --> 01:50:57.473]  Joseph, Stephen and others, stay with us.
[01:50:58.933 --> 01:51:03.038]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:03.038 --> 01:51:06.222]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:06.222 --> 01:51:07.864]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:07.864 --> 01:51:11.208]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:11.208 --> 01:51:12.710]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:51:12.710 --> 01:51:13.832]  Just won't quit.
[01:51:14.528 --> 01:51:16.871]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[01:51:16.871 --> 01:51:21.578]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?
[01:51:21.578 --> 01:51:23.340]  Get our 10 Reasons book free.
[01:51:23.340 --> 01:51:23.660]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:51:23.660 --> 01:51:23.841]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:51:30.028 --> 01:51:31.009]  Hey, Boomer!
[01:51:31.009 --> 01:51:34.471]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[01:51:34.471 --> 01:51:36.133]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[01:51:36.133 --> 01:51:38.094]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[01:51:38.094 --> 01:51:43.938]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[01:51:43.938 --> 01:51:44.758]  I know, right?
[01:51:44.758 --> 01:51:46.079]  You love it too!
[01:51:46.079 --> 01:51:47.500]  Yeah, I'm thirsty too.
[01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:48.541]  Let's go get some!
[01:51:48.541 --> 01:51:50.282]  Get Berkey Clean Water by calling 877-886-3653.
[01:51:50.282 --> 01:51:50.482]  That's 877-886-3653.
[01:51:50.482 --> 01:51:51.123]  Or visit GoBerkey.com.
[01:52:02.090 --> 01:52:11.676]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:52:11.676 --> 01:52:14.278]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:52:14.278 --> 01:52:17.961]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:52:17.961 --> 01:52:24.205]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:52:24.205 --> 01:52:28.908]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:52:29.228 --> 01:52:35.612]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:52:35.612 --> 01:52:43.277]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:52:43.277 --> 01:52:50.721]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[01:52:50.721 --> 01:52:54.324]  Obtain your ChildEase today at Infowarslife.com.
[01:52:54.324 --> 01:52:57.205]  That's ChildEase exclusively at Infowarslife.com.
[01:52:58.953 --> 01:53:03.417]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[01:53:03.417 --> 01:53:08.281]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[01:53:08.281 --> 01:53:15.747]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease, and a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[01:53:15.987 --> 01:53:18.650]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[01:53:18.650 --> 01:53:23.114]  I've taken whey protein products for years and I've never noticed results I have with your product.
[01:53:23.114 --> 01:53:26.298]  I've suffered with bouts of constipation most of my life.
[01:53:26.298 --> 01:53:30.622]  Within a few days of taking One World Whey, I noticed a dramatic change.
[01:53:30.622 --> 01:53:34.546]  Also in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[01:53:34.546 --> 01:53:37.989]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[01:53:38.670 --> 01:53:39.710]  Everybody knows
[01:54:07.276 --> 01:54:10.860]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[01:54:10.860 --> 01:54:16.466]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[01:54:16.466 --> 01:54:18.849]  Everybody knows the war is coming.
[01:54:25.732 --> 01:54:28.174]  Ron Finley, ronfinley.com is our guest.
[01:54:28.174 --> 01:54:36.119]  Maybe he'll do five more minutes the next hour and take more of your calls and see if he can stay with us, but I'm gonna cut over all the other news after he's gone.
[01:54:36.119 --> 01:54:37.560]  It's not over simplistic.
[01:54:38.467 --> 01:55:02.286]  To say, going back to the soapbox, going back to the community, going back to having your neighbors over for a barbecue, going back to having a garden, going back to disconnecting the television a few hours a day and taking your kids off the video games, going fishing, going playing a softball game, I mean just anything that's normal human activity that's not in this big globalist combine.
[01:55:03.371 --> 01:55:08.313]  And nothing like microagriculture is more powerful.
[01:55:08.313 --> 01:55:09.593]  That's why they're targeting Amish.
[01:55:09.593 --> 01:55:16.096]  It's why they're going after, like I said earlier, any type of farmer's markets, raw milk.
[01:55:16.096 --> 01:55:17.236]  It's why I've seen in L.A.
[01:55:17.236 --> 01:55:22.198]  where they go after these co-op places where people are coming and selling their produce.
[01:55:22.198 --> 01:55:26.919]  It's all done in the name of safety, but it's done to dominate and control people.
[01:55:26.919 --> 01:55:28.340]  Prisoners can't grow their own food.
[01:55:29.434 --> 01:55:31.137]  That's what it comes down to.
[01:55:31.137 --> 01:55:36.087]  Ron Finley, I want to take some more phone calls here, but anything else you'd like to add before we go to Joseph and others?
[01:55:37.625 --> 01:55:41.486]  No, just, I mean, you hit it on the head with the whole prisoner things.
[01:55:41.486 --> 01:55:47.768]  I mean, people think because they can get into their swanky cars and drive around that they're, that they're not in prison.
[01:55:47.768 --> 01:55:50.509]  I mean, and that's why I call these food prisons.
[01:55:50.509 --> 01:55:53.410]  You know, like you said, you can't grow your own food in prison.
[01:55:53.410 --> 01:55:54.330]  And that's bad.
[01:55:54.330 --> 01:56:02.072]  The fact that they have outlaw, you know, this is, this is, you get in, you become a criminal because you plant a carrot.
[01:56:02.072 --> 01:56:03.332]  It's ridiculous, man.
[01:56:03.332 --> 01:56:04.793]  And, um, uh,
[01:56:05.573 --> 01:56:06.515]  It has to change.
[01:56:06.515 --> 01:56:11.220]  And like you said earlier in the segment, we're seeing the fall, man.
[01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:14.164]  We're seeing, you know, McDonald's, some of those are closing.
[01:56:14.164 --> 01:56:18.008]  We're seeing them coming, oh, they're slowly changing.
[01:56:18.008 --> 01:56:23.075]  Natural Chicken, a lot of the stuff they're cutting out, you know.
[01:56:23.075 --> 01:56:24.636]  And that's because people are voting with their dollars.
[01:56:25.658 --> 01:56:28.522]  Exactly, and they see they have to.
[01:56:28.522 --> 01:56:37.354]  Their sales are down, and they're like, okay, now it's terrible that we have to take it to this point for them to do the right thing.
[01:56:37.354 --> 01:56:40.118]  Why are you selling me toxic food in the first place?
[01:56:40.618 --> 01:56:46.539]  You know, like with the thing with Dunkin' Donuts where they had the powdered sugar was supposed to be not powdered sugar.
[01:56:46.539 --> 01:56:50.980]  It was supposed to be some chemical or something that, you know, that looked like powdered sugar on the dough.
[01:56:50.980 --> 01:56:53.880]  Why are you, you know, why are you doing this to us?
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:56.821]  I mean, why would you do something to somebody you wouldn't want done to you?
[01:56:56.821 --> 01:57:01.562]  It's just, it's just, it's just a fundamental predatory nature.
[01:57:01.562 --> 01:57:03.182]  And as you said, the worm is turning.
[01:57:03.182 --> 01:57:04.562]  Very exciting times.
[01:57:04.562 --> 01:57:06.343]  Joseph in California, you're on the air.
[01:57:06.343 --> 01:57:07.003]  Go ahead.
[01:57:08.447 --> 01:57:10.428]  Hey, I have a question.
[01:57:10.428 --> 01:57:14.109]  Pleasure to be on your show, but I have a question for Finley.
[01:57:14.109 --> 01:57:18.791]  What do you think is the state's government role in agriculture?
[01:57:18.791 --> 01:57:21.512]  And for Jones, you just mentioned co-ops.
[01:57:21.512 --> 01:57:22.152]  Do you have like
[01:57:23.110 --> 01:57:26.532]  Do you think there should be a balance between socialism and crony capitalism?
[01:57:26.532 --> 01:57:33.777]  Because, you know, I'm what, I used to be a cookie cutter liberal, but now I'm a libertarian, and I just think there should be a balance between the two.
[01:57:33.777 --> 01:57:38.820]  Sure, listen, when you hear the term co-op, that has a communist connotation, they had co-ops for that.
[01:57:38.820 --> 01:57:46.845]  All that means is, people kind of come in as a group, share some of their profits to pay for the facility and for upkeep, but then people make profits.
[01:57:46.845 --> 01:57:52.108]  So I'm talking about co-ops based on, but again, co-ops only work on the micro.
[01:57:52.995 --> 01:57:57.977]  Okay, that's why small is beautiful, and that's what I've seen work in my own life, but that's my view.
[01:57:57.977 --> 01:58:01.358]  What's your take on that, Ron?
[01:58:01.358 --> 01:58:04.919]  Well, I mean, that's what I want.
[01:58:04.919 --> 01:58:08.720]  As you well know, Alex, you cannot eat all the food that you grow.
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:09.481]  It's impossible.
[01:58:09.481 --> 01:58:11.241]  That's all you will be doing is eating.
[01:58:11.241 --> 01:58:13.282]  We're so productive, we gotta share it.
[01:58:15.496 --> 01:58:24.619]  You had a block that was like a co-op where you grow carrots and onions and I grow lettuce and tomatoes and Sally grows cucumbers.
[01:58:24.619 --> 01:58:30.421]  So now you don't have to grow all your food because you can trade between your nations.
[01:58:30.421 --> 01:58:30.821]  Exactly!
[01:58:30.821 --> 01:58:31.842]  That's not communism.
[01:58:31.842 --> 01:58:33.882]  That's human activity interaction.
[01:58:33.882 --> 01:58:34.243]  Stay there.
[01:58:34.243 --> 01:58:35.583]  Do five more minutes with us.

[02:00:04.411 --> 02:00:06.193]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:06.193 --> 02:00:07.954]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:07.954 --> 02:00:09.535]  You want answers?
[02:00:09.535 --> 02:00:11.076]  Well, so does he.

[02:00:15.279 --> 02:00:19.341]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.165 --> 02:00:26.589]  Ron Finley, revolutionary gardener, just got the law changed in LA.
[02:00:26.589 --> 02:00:36.198]  A lot of plant plants and open commons areas in between your yard and the street.
[02:00:36.198 --> 02:00:37.739]  We got a few more calls I want to go to.
[02:00:37.739 --> 02:00:42.503]  Ray, Daniel, Susan, Stephanie and others, but you were trying to say something as we went to break.
[02:00:42.503 --> 02:00:43.164]  Ron, what was that?
[02:00:46.227 --> 02:00:49.993]  Oh, I got Alzheimer's disease.
[02:00:49.993 --> 02:00:51.154]  You got to give me what I think.
[02:00:51.154 --> 02:00:51.875]  No, no, I hear you.
[02:00:51.875 --> 02:00:52.656]  I forget all the time.
[02:00:52.656 --> 02:00:53.738]  I say, we're coming back with this.
[02:00:53.738 --> 02:00:55.300]  And I go, what was it I said I was coming back with?
[02:00:58.775 --> 02:01:10.068]  No, man, I just want us to realize that everybody, you know, it's all about changing this culture and designing your own life and being free and supporting your neighborhoods.
[02:01:16.936 --> 02:01:20.380]  If you heal your mother, you heal yourself.
[02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:30.109]  And our mother needs healing right now, you know, because we're destroying it and we're letting these corporations destroy it with their illegal dumping and the air pollution.
[02:01:30.109 --> 02:01:32.651]  And I mean, these are natural resources.
[02:01:32.651 --> 02:01:35.614]  People don't look at air as what it is.
[02:01:36.875 --> 02:01:38.496]  You know, if you don't have air, you don't live.
[02:01:38.496 --> 02:01:40.738]  I tell people it's the most important thing to your life.
[02:01:40.738 --> 02:01:42.979]  It's not food or water, it's air.
[02:01:42.979 --> 02:01:46.221]  You know, and we're destroying everything, man.
[02:01:46.221 --> 02:01:52.525]  I just, you know, you wake up and you're like, damn, you know, how are we allowing this to happen?
[02:01:52.525 --> 02:01:55.807]  Well, it all starts with, like you said, create a community around gardens.
[02:01:55.807 --> 02:01:58.009]  It's one of the most basic human activities.
[02:01:58.009 --> 02:02:01.371]  Civilization was founded by agrarian societies.
[02:02:01.371 --> 02:02:02.332]  It is the key.
[02:02:02.332 --> 02:02:03.993]  Ray in Iowa, thanks for holding.
[02:02:03.993 --> 02:02:04.293]  Go ahead.
[02:02:05.493 --> 02:02:06.175]  Uh, yes, sir.
[02:02:06.175 --> 02:02:08.281]  Mr. Alex Jones, how are you today?
[02:02:08.281 --> 02:02:09.505]  I'm doing alright, brother.
[02:02:09.505 --> 02:02:09.786]  Go ahead.
[02:02:11.043 --> 02:02:21.049]  Yes, I wanted to mention, I live up here in Northeast Iowa, and it's the, in my opinion, the Garden Belt, the God Belt of the world.
[02:02:21.049 --> 02:02:26.171]  And I am very fortunate to live in an area that people grow their gardens in their front yard.
[02:02:26.171 --> 02:02:28.052]  My city loves it.
[02:02:28.052 --> 02:02:33.455]  And I see a lot of this, but I did want to mention, I have a comment for Ron Finley.
[02:02:33.455 --> 02:02:36.217]  He is absolutely spot on the dot, because
[02:02:37.157 --> 02:02:49.308]  I was with my wife and we drove up to Strawberry Point, probably 45 miles away from where I'm at, and the incredible amount of wasted land on both sides of the interstate is just mind-numbing.
[02:02:49.308 --> 02:02:53.011]  You can't believe the amount of food that could be grown for people.
[02:02:53.011 --> 02:02:56.714]  And they pay to trim it, and they pay to upkeep it.
[02:02:56.714 --> 02:02:57.996]  It's just a complete joke.
[02:02:57.996 --> 02:03:00.458]  Sometimes they even water the interstate.
[02:03:00.458 --> 02:03:01.699]  It's completely insane.
[02:03:01.699 --> 02:03:02.580]  I mean, in Germany,
[02:03:04.853 --> 02:03:08.908]  And in Europe, you go there, they still plant on the highways.
[02:03:08.908 --> 02:03:09.892]  Your take on that, Ron?
[02:03:11.943 --> 02:03:12.784]  It's lamb.
[02:03:12.784 --> 02:03:17.807]  People are worried about, like, even on the parkways, they're like, well, what about cars' exhaust?
[02:03:17.807 --> 02:03:19.628]  What about, you know, tire dust?
[02:03:19.628 --> 02:03:22.269]  And I'm like, it's not that much traffic on these kind of streets.
[02:03:22.269 --> 02:03:30.974]  And plus, do you realize the diesel fuel that is exhausted when you, the food that you're getting at the store?
[02:03:30.974 --> 02:03:37.858]  How does this food, as you know, when you, when I pick a head of lettuce out of my garden, I better eat it within a couple hours.
[02:03:38.658 --> 02:03:43.601]  How the hell is this food organic and even regular food in these stores out?
[02:03:43.601 --> 02:03:46.362]  How does it stay that fresh that long?
[02:03:46.362 --> 02:03:56.928]  That's right, you walk 20 feet into your kitchen and cut it up and make a wedge salad, and my mouth's watering, and then meanwhile you might be eating lettuce from like Guatemala that got shipped up here on trucks.
[02:03:56.928 --> 02:03:58.809]  Then they spray chemicals on it to keep it green.
[02:04:00.273 --> 02:04:04.295]  Yeah, I don't get that.
[02:04:04.295 --> 02:04:07.056]  That's why I want my food hyper-local, not just local.
[02:04:07.056 --> 02:04:12.318]  And I think, why shouldn't food, everywhere they have a tree, why shouldn't it be a tree that feeds you?
[02:04:12.318 --> 02:04:23.443]  Like you were saying, when people homestead, when they decided, okay, that this place was fit to live, they checked, was this soil fertile?
[02:04:23.443 --> 02:04:24.884]  Can I grow food here?
[02:04:25.484 --> 02:04:30.049]  And that's how most places were developed, you know?
[02:04:30.049 --> 02:04:31.591]  Okay, can we grow food in the soil?
[02:04:32.813 --> 02:04:35.174]  We're just rediscovering basic human activity.
[02:04:35.174 --> 02:04:45.099]  Ron Finley, I hope you'll join us again, ronfinley.com, a true trailblazing revolutionary, rediscovering basic human activities, getting the law changed in L.A.
[02:04:45.099 --> 02:04:45.979]  and around the world.
[02:04:45.979 --> 02:04:50.161]  We salute you for having a true victory against tyranny.
[02:04:50.161 --> 02:04:50.862]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:50.862 --> 02:04:53.563]  I salute you for having me, Alex.
[02:04:53.563 --> 02:04:54.183]  Thanks a lot.
[02:04:54.183 --> 02:04:55.544]  We appreciate you.
[02:04:55.544 --> 02:04:56.845]  More calls, straight ahead in news.
[02:04:56.845 --> 02:04:57.305]  Stay with us.
[02:04:58.556 --> 02:05:02.560]  Did you know that the tipping point for global warming started back in the 80s?
[02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:08.306]  The UN reported that we were hurtling towards an unstoppable climate shift that would have dire consequences.
[02:05:08.306 --> 02:05:14.353]  Fast forward to Prince Charles' warning back in 2009 that we only had 96 months to save the planet.
[02:05:14.353 --> 02:05:15.614]  The clock is ticking on that one.
[02:05:15.914 --> 02:05:23.236]  And let's not forget Al Gore quoting studies back in 2007, stating that the polar ice caps would be completely gone by now.
[02:05:23.236 --> 02:05:28.838]  Earlier this year, we saw articles with headlines like, 2014, the hottest year on record.
[02:05:28.838 --> 02:05:33.940]  The same articles failed to mention cities like Chicago, Illinois, which saw its coldest weather in over 100 years.
[02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:38.641]  No mention of big ice-breaking ships getting stuck in ice?
[02:05:38.641 --> 02:05:49.305]  So remember, when these carbon tax pushers tell you to lessen your carbon footprint, they're about to leap into their multi-vehicle convoy, drive to their private jets, and then go to sleep in one of their many houses.
[02:05:49.305 --> 02:05:50.345]  Some by the sea.

[02:06:10.896 --> 02:06:16.840]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not
[02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:18.642]  Of the very highest quality.
[02:06:18.642 --> 02:06:21.126]  Or because they're not 100% organic.
[02:06:21.126 --> 02:06:27.735]  Or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:27.735 --> 02:06:34.184]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine, or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality.
[02:06:34.324 --> 02:06:38.127]  Lung cleanse, fluoride shields, oxy powder.
[02:06:38.127 --> 02:06:48.956]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.

[02:07:11.257 --> 02:07:13.958]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:07:13.958 --> 02:07:17.500]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:23.843]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:07:23.843 --> 02:07:26.364]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[02:07:26.564 --> 02:07:26.744]  I'm good.
[02:07:46.468 --> 02:07:50.630]  Like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[02:08:17.893 --> 02:08:23.555]  We've got a bank of phone callers that want to talk about their gardens.
[02:08:23.555 --> 02:08:37.321]  You're a new listener and you hear us talking about different cities trying to ban front yard, even backyard gardens, or people being indicted or arrest warrants being issued for planting, you know, fruit trees in the right-of-way.
[02:08:37.321 --> 02:08:43.503]  This is happening all over the country and it just feeds in to the overall domestication program.
[02:08:47.361 --> 02:08:59.104]  I want to get to some news, then I'll go back to your calls, and after this raft of calls are gone, we're going to open the phones up for any issue you'd like to raise, any topic, any point, disagree, agree.

[02:09:03.326 --> 02:09:10.908]  You know, I see articles in the news, like the Associated Press today, and I read them and I just can't believe them.
[02:09:10.908 --> 02:09:14.909]  Japan named a baby monkey this week, Charlotte.
[02:09:17.768 --> 02:09:20.410]  One of the most common names out there.
[02:09:20.410 --> 02:09:28.097]  And they apologized to England as if it was, to the UK, as if it was offensive.
[02:09:28.097 --> 02:09:31.920]  Because the baby, the new royal baby was named Charlotte.
[02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:34.262]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[02:09:34.262 --> 02:09:36.104]  The incredible butt-kissing.
[02:09:36.104 --> 02:09:42.229]  There's the NPR article that goes on for this usurper family that isn't even British.
[02:09:45.137 --> 02:09:45.918]  It's truly sick.
[02:09:45.918 --> 02:09:49.280]  I mean, we had a revolution against this very family.
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:53.984]  And then now, whether it's here or Japan, it's just worship of the royals.
[02:09:53.984 --> 02:09:59.588]  But oh my gosh, if you're making $125,000 a year, you're a rich pig who deserves to have your taxes raised.
[02:09:59.588 --> 02:10:03.051]  So says Warren Buffett and George Soros, because they're tax-exempt.
[02:10:03.051 --> 02:10:05.052]  Queen of England's tax-exempt.
[02:10:05.052 --> 02:10:08.555]  She's the biggest owner of British Petroleum.
[02:10:08.555 --> 02:10:11.877]  Queen Beatrix, the biggest owner of Dutch Rochelle.
[02:10:11.877 --> 02:10:12.898]  Princess Charlotte.
[02:10:17.611 --> 02:10:20.373]  Princess Charlotte.
[02:10:20.373 --> 02:10:22.735]  Charlotte Carlotta.
[02:10:22.735 --> 02:10:26.258]  A very pretty name.
[02:10:26.258 --> 02:10:27.820]  I guess everybody has to apologize.
[02:10:27.820 --> 02:10:29.321]  I bet there's some pigs named Charlotte.
[02:10:29.321 --> 02:10:31.503]  I bet there's some cows named Charlotte.
[02:10:31.503 --> 02:10:33.505]  I mean, the Charlotte's Web is about a pig.
[02:10:33.505 --> 02:10:36.267]  Or about a spider.
[02:10:36.267 --> 02:10:39.390]  Maybe the author of Charlotte's Web, are they still alive?
[02:10:39.390 --> 02:10:41.592]  Maybe they should apologize to the Queen of England.
[02:10:41.592 --> 02:10:43.994]  This is just stumbling over ourselves.
[02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:52.646]  Hundreds of billions of dollars, conservatively, the trillions in bailouts went to the Queen of England.
[02:10:52.646 --> 02:10:54.548]  It's an inversion of reality.
[02:10:54.548 --> 02:10:56.990]  I mean, I'm going to vomit.
[02:10:56.990 --> 02:10:57.390]  E.B.
[02:10:57.390 --> 02:11:02.295]  White, author of Charlotte's Web, is E.B.
[02:11:02.295 --> 02:11:03.756]  White's whole life?
[02:11:03.756 --> 02:11:05.017]  Dead.
[02:11:05.017 --> 02:11:05.337]  E.B.
[02:11:05.337 --> 02:11:08.139]  White needs to apologize, how dare you name a spider!
[02:11:09.153 --> 02:11:21.347]  You did that to make... So that's political correctness, where you just look for a fence where it isn't, while we're run by foreign banks raping us, cancer viruses and vaccines, fluoride in the water, GMO, mass manipulation.
[02:11:21.347 --> 02:11:24.491]  But oh my gosh!
[02:11:24.491 --> 02:11:28.596]  You insulted the Queen's or the Princess's new daughter!
[02:11:31.127 --> 02:11:35.390]  Voters flocked to the polls in Britain's knife-edge election, AP.
[02:11:35.390 --> 02:11:42.634]  Voters were chosen a new Parliament for the United Kingdom today, an election that is expected to be very close.
[02:11:42.634 --> 02:11:43.394]  Here's another one.
[02:11:43.394 --> 02:11:53.620]  Google search tips Cameron to win election and Nigel Farage's UKIP, which is a Patriot Liberty Group, will beat Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
[02:11:53.620 --> 02:11:54.521]  Man, that's got to scare them.
[02:11:56.175 --> 02:11:59.916]  So we're on the march, the empire's on the run, that's certainly happening there.
[02:11:59.916 --> 02:12:06.378]  And of course I mentioned this, Japan Zoo apologizes for naming newborn monkey Charlotte.
[02:12:06.378 --> 02:12:10.919]  Well, apologize to me, I got a daughter named that.
[02:12:10.919 --> 02:12:12.019]  Where's my apology?
[02:12:12.019 --> 02:12:13.620]  You did that to insult me.
[02:12:13.620 --> 02:12:17.021]  Of course you didn't, but that's political correctness.
[02:12:17.021 --> 02:12:23.502]  Japan Zoo apologizes for naming newborn monkey Charlotte.
[02:12:23.502 --> 02:12:25.423]  Oh my gosh, I just, I just, you know.
[02:12:29.540 --> 02:12:33.622]  It just shows the mind control.
[02:12:33.622 --> 02:12:35.623]  American tourists cause a security scare.
[02:12:35.623 --> 02:12:36.904]  How dare those Americans?
[02:12:36.904 --> 02:12:39.405]  By flying drone over Windsor Castle.
[02:12:39.405 --> 02:12:44.387]  Is there no end to the evil Americans?
[02:12:44.387 --> 02:12:46.808]  Here's an article.
[02:12:46.808 --> 02:12:54.512]  Man is raped at gunpoint by three women so they can collect the semen in a cooler box and steal it in South Africa.
[02:12:55.956 --> 02:13:02.344]  A man was kidnapped at gunpoint right by three women who collected his semen in a cool box and stealing it before abandoning their victim.
[02:13:02.344 --> 02:13:05.448]  And the method is part of a growing trend.
[02:13:05.448 --> 02:13:09.674]  A 33-year-old man gave the women directions when they pulled up in a black BMW.
[02:13:09.674 --> 02:13:13.859]  Suddenly, one of the women aimed a gun out and forced him to the back of the car at gunpoint.
[02:13:14.673 --> 02:13:23.418]  The trio then drove 50, 500 kilometers away, or 300 miles, and fondled him in the back of the car until he became aroused.
[02:13:23.418 --> 02:13:27.700]  So they forced him to drink an unknown substance from a bottle to aid him.
[02:13:27.700 --> 02:13:34.103]  Yeah, something tells me I wouldn't get too aroused when I was kidnapped.
[02:13:34.103 --> 02:13:37.365]  Unless it was a group of Meryl Monroes.
[02:13:37.365 --> 02:13:38.326]  Probably still not.
[02:13:42.162 --> 02:13:43.182]  You can't make this up.
[02:13:43.182 --> 02:13:49.024]  They then raped the man repeatedly and collected the semen in plastic bags, placing them in a cooler box.
[02:13:49.024 --> 02:14:01.527]  The man was kicked out of the car, 500 kilometers away, before they picked him up in KwaZa'ili Township, Port Elizabeth, and made off with the stolen sperm.
[02:14:01.527 --> 02:14:10.169]  The exact same method is being used by women in Gothing, who are also forcing men to drink from a bottle and stealing their semen, but no arrests were made.
[02:14:12.372 --> 02:14:17.994]  Let me guess, these women probably weren't too attractive.
[02:14:17.994 --> 02:14:19.155]  What are women going to do, though?
[02:14:19.155 --> 02:14:21.476]  There's a major trend where men don't want to date women.
[02:14:21.476 --> 02:14:27.378]  Not because they're gay, but just because women are so entitled, on average, so spoiled.
[02:14:27.378 --> 02:14:29.079]  Either women are amazing or they're horrible.
[02:14:29.079 --> 02:14:29.739]  Men are horrible, too.
[02:14:29.739 --> 02:14:30.359]  A bunch of slobs.
[02:14:30.359 --> 02:14:31.019]  I mean, we all know that.
[02:14:31.019 --> 02:14:31.760]  It's the modern culture.
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:37.262]  But the nicer you treat a woman, a lot of times, the worse they behave.
[02:14:40.711 --> 02:14:41.812]  You know, my dad's a sweetheart.
[02:14:41.812 --> 02:14:48.935]  I remember going on hunting trips and he'd look over and tell me about the waves of the world when I was like 10, 11 years old.
[02:14:48.935 --> 02:14:52.157]  He just said, you know, most women want you to be a little mean to them.
[02:14:52.157 --> 02:14:56.859]  And he goes, but we don't want to do that, so just be quiet.
[02:14:56.859 --> 02:14:58.860]  And then it makes them uneasy and then they're happy.
[02:14:58.860 --> 02:15:01.862]  And he goes, we don't want to be mean to them, but it's what they want.
[02:15:04.790 --> 02:15:07.052]  I just don't understand it.
[02:15:07.052 --> 02:15:08.032]  But that's not all women.
[02:15:08.032 --> 02:15:10.394]  That's not my grandmothers or my mother.
[02:15:10.394 --> 02:15:13.035]  Literally, they're exceptional women.
[02:15:13.035 --> 02:15:20.040]  But there really are a lot of screwed up people in this world.
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:20.741]  That's just some of those.
[02:15:20.741 --> 02:15:22.442]  There's probably 300 more articles here.
[02:15:22.442 --> 02:15:24.583]  I just don't even know where to start.
[02:15:24.583 --> 02:15:31.087]  Let's talk to Stefan in New York City, the home of Pace Picani Sauce.
[02:15:31.087 --> 02:15:31.848]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:15:33.346 --> 02:15:34.567]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:15:34.567 --> 02:15:37.849]  I was listening to that Van story, how they raped that guy.
[02:15:37.849 --> 02:15:40.110]  Imagine him trying to go and tell his friends what happened.
[02:15:40.110 --> 02:15:41.631]  They probably didn't even believe him.
[02:15:41.631 --> 02:15:43.452]  They're probably like, oh, get out of here, man.
[02:15:43.452 --> 02:15:44.733]  That didn't happen.
[02:15:44.733 --> 02:15:48.155]  Imagine they were like the women on the Supreme Court then.
[02:15:48.155 --> 02:15:48.856]  Oh, God, right?
[02:15:48.856 --> 02:15:50.977]  Imagine they were all a bunch of Hillary Clinton.
[02:15:50.977 --> 02:15:59.122]  But further, what I really wanted to tell you was I wanted to answer on real fast how we felt about hunting, but that's long gone.
[02:15:59.122 --> 02:16:00.963]  And now what I really want to talk about
[02:16:02.064 --> 02:16:08.171]  I mean, I don't want to have this attitude like I told you so, because I really don't.
[02:16:08.171 --> 02:16:13.217]  But I remember the first time I called you, I told you how they want to take you Texans out.
[02:16:13.217 --> 02:16:14.458]  I was like, that's what they want to do.
[02:16:14.458 --> 02:16:19.504]  They want to take you Texans out because you guys are really the last hope to really putting a fight to this.
[02:16:20.345 --> 02:16:27.829]  And I mean, at the time, I believe, like, the answer you gave me was like, oh, you have to understand, a lot of us are already taken out.
[02:16:27.829 --> 02:16:32.452]  A lot of us are, like, obese and, you know, sitting home and, you know, in trailers.
[02:16:32.452 --> 02:16:40.216]  Like, we might as well... I mean, not saying all... No, I said most people in rural areas work at the power plant or work at Walmart, and they go on the watch.
[02:16:41.016 --> 02:16:42.297]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:16:42.297 --> 02:16:48.559]  And the other thing is about with Jade Helm, I mean, you might have the job on a whole new 9-11.
[02:16:48.559 --> 02:16:53.882]  See, if you were to look at 9-11 and then you were to start telling people prior to 9-11 happening, the story would be, oh,
[02:17:08.582 --> 02:17:13.264]  B.S., you're telling me that Americans are going to bring down an American tower?
[02:17:13.264 --> 02:17:14.764]  B.S., show me, show me.
[02:17:14.764 --> 02:17:15.725]  So then look what happens.
[02:17:15.725 --> 02:17:18.726]  It ends up being a terrorist bringing down this tower, and then they were helping.
[02:17:18.726 --> 02:17:25.049]  So when you see Jade Helm going around and them saying, oh, you believe Americans are going to fight other Americans?
[02:17:25.049 --> 02:17:30.731]  No, it could very well be a terrorist attack, and then boom, there is the Jade Helm squad, and they're ready to go.
[02:17:31.821 --> 02:17:42.586]  That's why I feel they might be trying to discredit you so fast and so much, because you're really flying not only over the flag, but you're probably in the flag and in the dome bubble.
[02:17:42.586 --> 02:17:43.266]  You know what I mean?
[02:17:43.266 --> 02:17:47.107]  So right now, you're going to be getting... Well, we're all doing this together, brother.
[02:17:47.107 --> 02:17:48.628]  My guests, my callers, all of us.
[02:17:48.628 --> 02:17:51.569]  I mean, I'm just one guy here, but thank you so much for the call.
[02:17:51.569 --> 02:17:54.751]  Good to hear from you, Stefan.
[02:17:54.751 --> 02:17:56.992]  It's really one of two things.
[02:17:56.992 --> 02:18:00.073]  Either it's a PSYOP test, which they admit it's a PSYOP,
[02:18:02.452 --> 02:18:06.958]  Because they know it's really just a drill for mainly overseas.
[02:18:06.958 --> 02:18:19.134]  They can project it and act like we're saying that, you know, the military hates America to demonize groups that are against paramilitarization and the incremental occupation of the country with the TSA and the rest of it.
[02:18:22.045 --> 02:18:22.866]  We're good to go.
[02:18:37.935 --> 02:18:45.123]  Then the terror attacks at the London bombing, 9-11, the list goes on and on where they run the exact same attack, the exact same time, exact same targets.
[02:18:45.123 --> 02:18:46.684]  I mean, that's impossible.
[02:18:46.684 --> 02:18:55.534]  Both 9-11 and 7-7 in London, the train and bus bombing, were the exact targets, exact times with drills.
[02:18:55.534 --> 02:18:58.357]  I just, it's not bad that you called in and speculated, it's just that
[02:18:59.693 --> 02:19:11.376]  We're under such scrutiny that I don't even like to speculate, even though it's important to war game stuff, and to say I'm speculating, because they'll edit it, and make it look like I said something I didn't.
[02:19:11.376 --> 02:19:13.837]  I mean, they do that constantly.
[02:19:13.837 --> 02:19:21.359]  But at the end of the day, people can tune in and hear what I really said, so the other side of me says, just, you know, say what you really think, and just let them attack you.
[02:19:22.196 --> 02:19:24.238]  Because, I mean, I'm way in over my head.
[02:19:24.238 --> 02:19:25.820]  And here's the deal.
[02:19:25.820 --> 02:19:28.062]  The global engineers think they're in control.
[02:19:28.062 --> 02:19:29.984]  They're not in control of Jack's squad.
[02:19:29.984 --> 02:19:31.546]  Then we come back with Narls Barkley if we can.
[02:19:34.304 --> 02:19:36.085]  Everybody's in over their head.
[02:19:36.085 --> 02:19:38.627]  So at the end of the day, people say, I don't want to hear you talk about God.
[02:19:38.627 --> 02:19:39.188]  I'm sick of it.
[02:19:39.188 --> 02:19:44.872]  Listen, the more hardcore all this gets, the more serious this gets, the more I need Christ.
[02:19:44.872 --> 02:19:48.995]  You can call it my, you know, blanket or something like I'm two years old, whatever.
[02:19:48.995 --> 02:19:50.896]  It gives me solace.
[02:19:50.896 --> 02:19:52.938]  And there are no atheists in foxholes.
[02:19:52.938 --> 02:19:54.299]  I can tell you that right now.
[02:19:54.299 --> 02:19:54.939]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:54.939 --> 02:19:55.320]  Stay with us.

[02:23:01.704 --> 02:23:06.106]  From the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:23:06.106 --> 02:23:10.289]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:23:10.289 --> 02:23:12.230]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:23:12.230 --> 02:23:14.651]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:23:14.651 --> 02:23:22.335]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[02:23:22.735 --> 02:23:31.799]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.

[02:23:45.524 --> 02:23:47.365]  If you have ever thought about owning gold,
[02:23:50.746 --> 02:23:53.848]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[02:23:53.848 --> 02:24:01.894]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[02:24:01.894 --> 02:24:04.035]  Even your emotions had an echo in so much space.
[02:24:23.416 --> 02:24:26.717]  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough.
[02:24:26.717 --> 02:24:30.879]  I knew too much.
[02:24:30.879 --> 02:24:33.039]  Crank it up for a moment.
[02:24:33.039 --> 02:24:34.160]  Does that make me crazy?
[02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:34.400]  Possibly.
[02:24:50.469 --> 02:24:51.669]  We can't make this story up.
[02:24:51.669 --> 02:24:56.691]  We're going to get to it after I take more calls.
[02:24:56.691 --> 02:25:02.973]  Marxist professor fails student for not denouncing Christian faith in support of feminism.
[02:25:02.973 --> 02:25:08.575]  Biased exam questions painted Christians as false, violent, and oppressive to women.
[02:25:08.575 --> 02:25:11.236]  But you'll never hear the left criticize radical Islam.
[02:25:14.173 --> 02:25:15.914]  Man, the war is just on.
[02:25:15.914 --> 02:25:18.076]  That's at Infowars.com by Kit Daniels.
[02:25:18.076 --> 02:25:21.678]  We're going to cover more of that, where it happened, what went on.
[02:25:21.678 --> 02:25:25.040]  But all we've got to do is point this stuff out and stand up against it, and it'll fold.
[02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:30.764]  But the question is, will we?
[02:25:30.764 --> 02:25:32.265]  Right now, let's go back to your call.
[02:25:32.265 --> 02:25:34.826]  Susan in California, you're on the air.
[02:25:34.826 --> 02:25:35.527]  Thanks for holding.
[02:25:35.527 --> 02:25:35.807]  Welcome.
[02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:39.741]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[02:25:39.741 --> 02:25:48.685]  I was calling because our town is in the middle of one of these fights going on right now with having dwarf goats.
[02:25:48.685 --> 02:25:52.927]  And it started with the family, the Freeman family, in Visalia, California.
[02:25:52.927 --> 02:25:56.288]  And she has two children, a seven-week-old and a 19-month-old.
[02:25:56.288 --> 02:26:02.291]  And due to a congenital abnormality, she can't produce breast milk.
[02:26:02.291 --> 02:26:04.392]  And so now the city has come down and
[02:26:05.652 --> 02:26:07.333]  Why is she being racist against GMOs?
[02:26:07.333 --> 02:26:11.214]  I mean, so what if GMOs mutate other mammals in studies?
[02:26:11.214 --> 02:26:14.716]  Why not give her children over to the mutation and just prove that she's loving?
[02:26:30.648 --> 02:26:31.708]  Right, exactly.
[02:26:31.708 --> 02:26:32.348]  Exactly.
[02:26:32.348 --> 02:26:35.409]  I guess she wants more high-fructose corn syrup, you know.
[02:26:35.409 --> 02:26:37.629]  I mean, I just don't get it.
[02:26:37.629 --> 02:26:39.070]  Well, they're losing right now.
[02:26:39.070 --> 02:26:40.130]  They're losing momentum.
[02:26:40.130 --> 02:26:41.010]  People are waking up.
[02:26:41.010 --> 02:26:42.450]  That's why they're panicking.
[02:26:42.450 --> 02:26:44.071]  It's shattering the left-right paradigm.
[02:26:44.071 --> 02:26:53.732]  But, you know, I've heard about the moves to ban dwarf goats, ban chickens, even in areas that historically have grandfather clauses to allow that.
[02:26:53.732 --> 02:26:55.573]  Tell me specifically about what's happening.
[02:26:55.573 --> 02:26:56.833]  They don't want to have goats in the backyard?
[02:26:57.961 --> 02:26:58.862]  No, not in the backyard.
[02:26:58.862 --> 02:27:01.907]  She just has two and it's to feed her infant children.
[02:27:01.907 --> 02:27:06.272]  And, um, and the city has come in and said, you know, that can't happen.
[02:27:06.272 --> 02:27:07.734]  Yeah, I see it.
[02:27:07.734 --> 02:27:09.437]  I see it in the Times Delta.
[02:27:09.437 --> 02:27:10.318]  Yeah.
[02:27:10.318 --> 02:27:12.601]  Those evil little goats that are giving the children milk.
[02:27:12.601 --> 02:27:13.102]  How dare them?
[02:27:14.153 --> 02:27:34.320]  Yes, so she has a petition on Change.org and she also, if I could throw out her plug, just to keep up on this goat battle we have in California here, it's DomesticGeekGirl.com and we could use all the help because, again, we are in the breadbasket of California.
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:42.606]  And for them to say, two tiny dwarf goats, this isn't a full-sized goat, and it's feeding her baby.
[02:27:42.606 --> 02:27:45.189]  Oh, so racist.
[02:27:45.189 --> 02:27:48.552]  Ugh, it just, it just, this one tugs at my heartstrings personally.
[02:27:48.552 --> 02:27:50.233]  It really does.
[02:27:50.233 --> 02:27:50.754]  Really does.
[02:27:51.553 --> 02:27:56.058]  Well, it's sick, and again, there is a premeditated war on this.
[02:27:56.058 --> 02:28:00.782]  It's not like she has goats in an apartment complex where it's a private company saying this.
[02:28:00.782 --> 02:28:01.623]  I now see the story.
[02:28:01.623 --> 02:28:08.770]  There are two little goats that she feeds her baby with, and I guess she's just supposed to give them the formula that's like half corn syrup.
[02:28:08.770 --> 02:28:10.572]  This is just crazy.
[02:28:10.572 --> 02:28:14.256]  And, you know, they say those miniature goats make good pets as well, and it teaches the kids how to
[02:28:14.736 --> 02:28:18.578]  Milk their own food, feed the animals, just normal human activity.
[02:28:18.578 --> 02:28:19.919]  It's gotta be outlawed.
[02:28:19.919 --> 02:28:21.140]  Gotta be outlawed, Susan.
[02:28:21.140 --> 02:28:23.301]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:28:23.301 --> 02:28:25.002]  Oh, look at the child learning how to milk the goat.
[02:28:25.002 --> 02:28:26.503]  That is so evil.
[02:28:26.503 --> 02:28:29.685]  He's learning how to play an Xbox or something, or take some vaccines.
[02:28:29.685 --> 02:28:30.765]  Daniel in Tennessee.
[02:28:30.765 --> 02:28:31.606]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:28:31.606 --> 02:28:35.788]  I like that.
[02:28:35.788 --> 02:28:36.369]  Is that a flute?
[02:28:37.324 --> 02:28:38.845]  Yeah, I'm part Native American.
[02:28:38.845 --> 02:28:39.905]  I'm Appalachian American.
[02:28:39.905 --> 02:28:44.787]  And I was wondering, are you related to John Paul Jones, the founder of the Navy?
[02:28:44.787 --> 02:28:46.708]  No, I'm not related to John Paul Jones.
[02:28:46.708 --> 02:28:53.651]  That was a name that he adopted when he moved to the United States.
[02:28:53.651 --> 02:28:54.711]  He was Scottish.
[02:28:54.711 --> 02:28:56.472]  He was not Welsh.
[02:28:56.472 --> 02:29:00.593]  But he adopted it to honor the name Jones because somebody with the name Jones helped him out.
[02:29:00.593 --> 02:29:01.554]  I forget the exact story.
[02:29:02.304 --> 02:29:11.690]  It's wild your listeners should look him up because there's a great resemblance to you if you look at the pictures of him when he fought in the Revolutionary War.
[02:29:11.690 --> 02:29:16.133]  No, I'm related to a lot of illustrious Joneses, but not to the founder of the U.S.
[02:29:16.133 --> 02:29:17.674]  Navy, John Paul Jones.
[02:29:17.674 --> 02:29:20.556]  But I know there's a lot of Scots that are.
[02:29:20.556 --> 02:29:22.437]  Stay there, I'm not going to hang up on you, Daniel.
[02:29:22.437 --> 02:29:23.278]  I don't want to cut you short.
[02:29:23.278 --> 02:29:25.519]  Then we'll go to Bo T.
[02:29:27.862 --> 02:29:31.045]  Joshua, Lewis, and others.
[02:29:31.045 --> 02:29:33.187]  Look, it's the order of life.
[02:29:33.187 --> 02:29:36.650]  We're on that side against the order of death.
[02:29:36.650 --> 02:29:38.752]  And what you want is what you get.
[02:29:38.752 --> 02:29:41.734]  Well, I cast my lot for life.
[02:29:41.734 --> 02:29:43.676]  I bet everything on it.
[02:29:43.676 --> 02:29:44.997]  I commit to it.
[02:29:44.997 --> 02:29:47.980]  To fortune and to God's providence.
[02:29:47.980 --> 02:29:49.381]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.381 --> 02:29:51.903]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.903 --> 02:29:54.626]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.116 --> 02:29:59.977]  Texas Rep.
[02:29:59.977 --> 02:30:07.443]  Louie Gohmert is joining a long list of congressmen who are actually doing their job and addressing the concerns of their citizens.
[02:30:07.443 --> 02:30:12.988]  Gohmert says he understands the concerns Texans have about the upcoming Jade Helm exercise.
[02:30:12.988 --> 02:30:19.353]  The congressman took particular issue with the map's labeling of Republican-majority states as hostile.
[02:30:19.833 --> 02:30:33.736]  Gohmert called on the Pentagon to change the map, the names on the map, and said the tone of the exercise needs to be completely revamped so the federal government is not intentionally practicing war against its own states.
[02:30:33.736 --> 02:30:39.898]  Former Texas governor and potential presidential candidate Rick Perry has some different thoughts though.
[02:30:39.898 --> 02:30:44.779]  Perry said, it's okay to question your government, but the military is something else.
[02:30:45.399 --> 02:30:48.744]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:30:48.744 --> 02:30:56.054]  To keep up with all of the breaking Jade Helm news, visit InfoWars.com and subscribe to the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[02:30:58.479 --> 02:31:02.401]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:31:02.401 --> 02:31:06.202]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:31:06.202 --> 02:31:09.224]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:31:09.224 --> 02:31:16.447]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:31:16.667 --> 02:31:20.550]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:31:20.550 --> 02:31:24.893]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:31:24.893 --> 02:31:30.797]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:31:30.797 --> 02:31:34.660]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:31:34.660 --> 02:31:37.362]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:31:37.362 --> 02:31:38.823]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:31:38.823 --> 02:31:40.204]  It's time to take action.
[02:31:40.204 --> 02:31:41.825]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:31:58.354 --> 02:32:07.461]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:32:07.461 --> 02:32:15.868]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:32:15.868 --> 02:32:20.751]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:32:20.751 --> 02:32:24.394]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[02:32:25.595 --> 02:32:26.395]  We're good to go.
[02:32:49.585 --> 02:32:55.897]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:32:55.897 --> 02:32:57.561]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[02:33:10.146 --> 02:33:14.288]  It began with the forging of the Great Rings.
[02:33:14.288 --> 02:33:21.710]  Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest, and fairest of all beings.
[02:33:21.710 --> 02:33:29.373]  Seven to the Dwarf Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the Mountain Halls.
[02:33:29.373 --> 02:33:30.734]  And nine.
[02:33:30.734 --> 02:33:36.776]  Nine rings were gifted to the race of men who, above all else, desire power.
[02:33:38.942 --> 02:33:45.671]  For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.
[02:33:45.671 --> 02:33:49.095]  But they were all of them deceived.
[02:33:49.095 --> 02:33:50.718]  For another ring was made.
[02:33:52.099 --> 02:34:03.005]  In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring to control all others.
[02:34:03.005 --> 02:34:09.548]  And into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice, and his will to dominate all life.
[02:34:26.137 --> 02:34:28.238]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:28.238 --> 02:34:30.199]  Because there is a war on.
[02:34:30.199 --> 02:34:33.701]  For your life.
[02:34:33.701 --> 02:34:34.682]  Goodwill.
[02:34:34.682 --> 02:34:36.403]  That's our goal.
[02:34:36.403 --> 02:34:39.525]  Standing up for just prosperity and freedom.
[02:34:39.525 --> 02:34:40.385]  Transparency.
[02:34:40.385 --> 02:34:42.266]  Honor.
[02:34:42.266 --> 02:34:43.447]  The choice is in the heart.
[02:34:43.447 --> 02:34:44.828]  It changes the destiny of the world.
[02:34:46.075 --> 02:34:47.595]  I want to hit a ton of news.
[02:34:47.595 --> 02:34:55.277]  I mean, they covered some of it yesterday, but Towne's putting up license plate reading cameras and hidden cactuses.
[02:34:55.277 --> 02:35:00.558]  Tracker chips going on the driver's license, federally funded, that know when you're going to the bathroom.
[02:35:00.558 --> 02:35:04.979]  Your iPhone, your Droid, follows every calorie you eat, what you do.
[02:35:04.979 --> 02:35:06.940]  Siri reports everything back to the government.
[02:35:06.940 --> 02:35:10.481]  I mean, this is a joke.
[02:35:10.481 --> 02:35:14.782]  And the people running things are eugenicists.
[02:35:14.782 --> 02:35:15.582]  They're globalists.
[02:35:18.241 --> 02:35:41.853]  Do we ever get that quote from John Paul Jones of only begun to fight because he's fighting like a British ship three times his size And they tell him to surrender And he says I have not yet begun to fight when he screamed at him, and then he ended up sinking the British ship but He was a professional soldier Nationality was American.
[02:35:41.853 --> 02:35:46.956]  He was actually born in Scotland since you mentioned John Paul Jones man these guys were all such characters and
[02:35:48.647 --> 02:35:51.629]  Real characters.
[02:35:51.629 --> 02:35:55.131]  But one could spend all day just studying them.
[02:35:55.131 --> 02:35:57.853]  That's why I just have a cursory understanding of each person.
[02:35:57.853 --> 02:35:58.934]  But that's better than most.
[02:35:58.934 --> 02:36:03.657]  I mean, most people out there have no grasp of anything.
[02:36:03.657 --> 02:36:06.318]  Except the image of how to look successful or act powerful.
[02:36:06.318 --> 02:36:07.619]  It's like our last guest said.
[02:36:07.619 --> 02:36:10.481]  I thought it was a very poignant, intelligent guest.
[02:36:10.481 --> 02:36:11.342]  Had a great spirit.
[02:36:11.342 --> 02:36:11.882]  You could feel it.
[02:36:16.035 --> 02:36:18.796]  People thinking rolling around in fancy cars that they're free.
[02:36:18.796 --> 02:36:19.617]  No.
[02:36:19.617 --> 02:36:31.643]  Now if you've got a fancy car, and you're promoting liberty and freedom and got a big garden and healthy happy kids and everything, you like a car that runs well, nothing wrong with it, but the car itself does not make the man.
[02:36:31.643 --> 02:36:34.204]  Like there's nothing more manly than a guy with a big beard.
[02:36:34.204 --> 02:36:35.685]  Men have beards.
[02:36:35.685 --> 02:36:38.227]  It's an affected Grecian or Roman thing to not have a beard.
[02:36:38.227 --> 02:36:39.387]  I don't like it, it's scratchy.
[02:36:39.387 --> 02:36:40.828]  I don't put men down who had beards.
[02:36:40.828 --> 02:36:42.449]  It's fine with me that beards are back in style.
[02:36:43.487 --> 02:36:48.231]  It's men trying to, I guess, reclaim, there's a lot of sociology written on it, reclaim their manhood.
[02:36:48.231 --> 02:36:51.094]  They feel like they've been gelded.
[02:36:51.094 --> 02:36:53.736]  But the beard does not make the man.
[02:36:53.736 --> 02:36:58.180]  Just like the cowboy hat does not make a cattleman.
[02:36:58.180 --> 02:36:59.841]  Like, I could call myself a cowboy.
[02:36:59.841 --> 02:37:02.744]  I could say I own cows, I do.
[02:37:02.744 --> 02:37:04.265]  I could call myself a rancher.
[02:37:04.265 --> 02:37:08.008]  But you notice, I don't wear a cowboy hat.
[02:37:08.008 --> 02:37:09.450]  I'm all cattle, no hat.
[02:37:11.010 --> 02:37:20.373]  But, you see, for a man who's been around real cowboys, I am not a cowboy.
[02:37:20.373 --> 02:37:33.136]  And when you sit there and you look at these fake liberals, these piles of human manipulating trash, to call themselves liberal, liberal just means well-read.
[02:37:33.136 --> 02:37:34.756]  Liberal means you're into freedom.
[02:37:34.756 --> 02:37:36.537]  Well, man, I'm the biggest liberal around.
[02:37:38.083 --> 02:37:43.766]  But your freedom ends when it crosses my threshold and tells me what to do.
[02:37:43.766 --> 02:37:46.767]  And you look at what these politicians are pushing and what they're doing.
[02:37:46.767 --> 02:37:50.029]  They are sick people.
[02:37:50.029 --> 02:37:54.411]  And good men and women, I don't care what color you are, where you came from, we all do the same thing.
[02:37:54.411 --> 02:37:56.672]  We're all the same in our heart, in our DNA.
[02:37:56.672 --> 02:37:58.473]  At the end of the day, we're all humans.
[02:37:58.473 --> 02:38:01.014]  We act the same.
[02:38:01.014 --> 02:38:05.597]  Different races of the human race are just different subgroups
[02:38:06.676 --> 02:38:17.900]  of the overall race, and I don't mean subgroup in a bad connotation, different derivation.
[02:38:17.900 --> 02:38:30.904]  It's like a rock squirrel in Central Texas, a little bit bigger, a little bit more aggressive, and they're black and gray, and then you got the classic squirrel, it's brown.
[02:38:30.904 --> 02:38:33.104]  Well, they can still breed together, but they don't.
[02:38:33.104 --> 02:38:34.825]  It's a funny thing.
[02:38:36.428 --> 02:38:40.881]  Because it's two different clans, it's two different groups, two different tribes.
[02:38:45.694 --> 02:38:53.036]  But then you can go to Enchanted Rock and see rock squirrels that have bred with two other different subspecies of squirrels and it's these cool looking spotted squirrels.
[02:38:53.036 --> 02:38:54.697]  So, in some areas they do.
[02:38:54.697 --> 02:39:01.239]  But it's whatever the environment pressure drives them to do is what it then produces.
[02:39:01.239 --> 02:39:03.800]  And the average person never even thinks of things like this.
[02:39:03.800 --> 02:39:11.682]  They just sit back and let other men and women engineer the planet and engineer the culture the way they see fit and then guess what?
[02:39:11.682 --> 02:39:14.003]  These are a bunch of greedy, hateful people
[02:39:15.216 --> 02:39:28.969]  That have engineered the culture so that it's easy for them to run and makes them feel big because we're dumbed down and poor and stupid.
[02:39:28.969 --> 02:39:31.070]  Well, that's no elite right there.
[02:39:31.070 --> 02:39:33.853]  A real elite wants to raise people up.
[02:39:33.853 --> 02:39:38.017]  A real elite is so cool that they don't need to dominate, they're going to be followed.
[02:39:43.055 --> 02:39:48.176]  A real elite revels in seeing other people become greater than they.
[02:39:48.176 --> 02:39:51.637]  Because there's a shared kinsmanship and a strength in the species.
[02:39:51.637 --> 02:39:55.618]  I'm going to hit a bunch of news, but let's go through the next five or six callers.
[02:39:55.618 --> 02:39:57.458]  Daniel in Tennessee, finish up your point.
[02:39:57.458 --> 02:40:00.459]  Sorry the break cut you off.
[02:40:00.459 --> 02:40:02.399]  Hey, I'm sorry Alex.
[02:40:02.399 --> 02:40:03.700]  I'm sorry brother.
[02:40:03.700 --> 02:40:04.820]  I was playing my flute.
[02:40:05.413 --> 02:40:07.435]  I was going to say, I'm Appalachian American.
[02:40:07.435 --> 02:40:12.240]  I was born in Southwest Virginia, East Tennessee, and I'm related to A.P.
[02:40:12.240 --> 02:40:15.243]  Carter and Mother Maybell in June and Johnny Cashburn to our family.
[02:40:15.243 --> 02:40:19.407]  If you ever get a chance to take your kids, ask David Knott, because he's from North Carolina.
[02:40:19.407 --> 02:40:23.491]  Go down to Smokey's on the Tennessee side or the North Carolina side and go check out Cherokee.
[02:40:23.491 --> 02:40:29.677]  I got family down there, too, and I just wanted to encourage you that you have a lot of listeners in the Knoxville area.
[02:40:30.157 --> 02:40:30.757]  I know I do.
[02:40:30.757 --> 02:40:33.259]  That's some of the most beautiful country in the world, I tell you.
[02:40:33.259 --> 02:40:34.459]  I loved it.
[02:40:34.459 --> 02:40:45.505]  Back when I was a kid, my parents would do road trips into the Appalachias and into the Smokies and we would spend a lot of times every year, about a week or so there, just over the top beautiful.
[02:40:46.476 --> 02:40:46.816]  I don't know.
[02:41:06.643 --> 02:41:28.569]  Like, how important, like, aboriginal culture and stuff is, but if you can ever get John Trudale, or if you can ever get, um, not Russell Means has passed away, Floyd Weston and Red Cross passed away, if you can get on Dennis Banks, and John Trudale, maybe to talk about, you know, plants or gardens or anything, but I see my friends and family, like in Cherokee, and even my Appalachian family that used to camp, you spoke the truth, brother, when you said that if it
[02:41:29.284 --> 02:41:32.606]  If it wasn't for Canada during the Great Depression, our people would have died out.
[02:41:32.606 --> 02:41:35.207]  I mean, we hunted the turkey and the deer to almost extinction.
[02:41:35.207 --> 02:41:37.568]  Extinction because we were starving to death.
[02:41:37.568 --> 02:41:38.209]  No, I hear you.
[02:41:38.209 --> 02:41:45.832]  I mean, my family in East Texas was upper middle class, a lot of them, but they still shot deer out of season.
[02:41:45.832 --> 02:41:49.714]  And people make fun of it, but they ate possums and stuff.
[02:41:49.714 --> 02:41:53.216]  And especially the poor blacks ate whatever they could get just to survive.
[02:41:53.216 --> 02:41:56.238]  People make jokes about poor people eating possum and stuff.
[02:41:56.238 --> 02:41:58.439]  I mean, you eat a possum or you die.
[02:41:59.079 --> 02:42:15.306]  And can you imagine when the society collapses, which they're designing, this is Gen 21 collapse program, and selling the idea of what it's going to be like when the average yuppie... I mean, I don't know how to fix a car, or roof a house, or fix the plumbing like my dad does.
[02:42:15.306 --> 02:42:17.867]  And he doesn't know how to do it like his daddy did.
[02:42:17.867 --> 02:42:20.888]  But compared to the general public, I'm like a handyman.
[02:42:20.888 --> 02:42:26.270]  Can you imagine when the crap hits the oscillating cylinder, what's going to happen?
[02:42:27.941 --> 02:42:28.522]  Oh, definitely.
[02:42:28.522 --> 02:42:35.848]  And it's like you were saying, during the Great Depression, people don't believe it, but our ancestors, yours too, because, you know, you're from this area originally.
[02:42:35.848 --> 02:42:42.734]  People got so hungry, Alex, that people even bowled the soles of their boots and shoes, you know, to eat them.
[02:42:42.734 --> 02:42:44.815]  That's how hungry people were during the Great Depression.
[02:42:44.815 --> 02:42:47.498]  People don't realize how serious that was.
[02:42:48.612 --> 02:42:49.732]  Well, they're going to find out.
[02:42:49.732 --> 02:42:59.016]  This whole artificial system is coming down by design and the government's bunkering and huge stockpiles of food and medicine and water.
[02:42:59.016 --> 02:43:05.559]  I look at this, and I appreciate your call, and I mean, it's like aliens are running it.
[02:43:05.559 --> 02:43:06.919]  And I want to be clear.
[02:43:06.919 --> 02:43:08.580]  I'm not saying aliens are running it.
[02:43:08.580 --> 02:43:09.581]  I don't get into all that.
[02:43:09.581 --> 02:43:14.042]  But the more I look at it, it's like the Bible says.
[02:43:14.042 --> 02:43:15.263]  It is not of this world.
[02:43:17.270 --> 02:43:22.414]  What governs this world, the God of this world, is not of this world.
[02:43:22.414 --> 02:43:33.103]  Because elites do things that are even against their own self-interest to hurt the earth, to hurt fellow humans.
[02:43:33.103 --> 02:43:35.025]  And it's beyond just enjoying hurting people.
[02:43:39.568 --> 02:43:41.730]  But it's also just a bunch of spoiled, rotten people.
[02:43:41.730 --> 02:43:48.415]  I mean, there's just so many spoiled, rotten people out there that think it's their right to do whatever they want and dominate other people.
[02:43:48.415 --> 02:43:52.459]  And good people have laid down and created a climate that's allowed all this.
[02:43:52.459 --> 02:43:54.641]  Bo T, thanks for holding from Texas.
[02:43:54.641 --> 02:43:56.442]  You're on the air with Gardening Ideas.
[02:43:56.442 --> 02:43:57.843]  Go ahead.
[02:43:57.843 --> 02:43:59.264]  Hey, what's up, Bob?
[02:43:59.264 --> 02:44:01.026]  Go ahead, my friend.
[02:44:01.026 --> 02:44:04.449]  Hey, uh, you know out here in Houston they got the astrodome, right?
[02:44:05.014 --> 02:44:05.474]  Yes, sir.
[02:44:05.474 --> 02:44:11.597]  Well, I'm proposing an idea to turn that son of a bitch into the world's largest greenhouse.
[02:44:11.597 --> 02:44:17.460]  Now, I think that's a beautiful idea to have, uh, use that to have taxpayers pay for that.
[02:44:17.460 --> 02:44:22.503]  I don't want no fat cat getting a hold of it and use it for a gambling casino or anything like that.
[02:44:22.503 --> 02:44:24.324]  What do you think about that idea?
[02:44:24.324 --> 02:44:27.726]  Well, aren't they using the Astrodome for, like, conventions and stuff?
[02:44:29.013 --> 02:44:30.874]  Not AstroGum is decrepit.
[02:44:30.874 --> 02:44:32.475]  It's vacant.
[02:44:32.475 --> 02:44:33.756]  They don't know what to do with it.
[02:44:46.485 --> 02:44:54.891]  That would be a great idea to turn that into a greenhouse and let people go, register, get signed up, and then have their plot to grow stuff in there.
[02:44:54.891 --> 02:44:59.334]  But that's the last thing governments want, is to teach people to be self-sufficient.
[02:44:59.334 --> 02:45:05.518]  I follow sports so little that I apologize that I wasn't aware of what was going on in the Astrodome.
[02:45:05.518 --> 02:45:08.019]  Where do they play baseball now?
[02:45:08.019 --> 02:45:14.684]  Well, they've got a place called Minute Maid Park, and then the football team got a brand new stadium right by the Astrodome.
[02:45:15.495 --> 02:45:17.776]  Well, maybe Hillary can store all the stolen money in there or something.
[02:45:17.776 --> 02:45:18.436]  Good to hear you.
[02:45:18.436 --> 02:45:19.517]  I appreciate those points.
[02:45:19.517 --> 02:45:20.517]  Lewis in Texas, go ahead.
[02:45:20.517 --> 02:45:20.737]  Welcome.
[02:45:20.737 --> 02:45:21.458]  Hi Alex, pleasure to be on.
[02:45:39.901 --> 02:45:52.173]  I just started listening to your show about six months ago, basically in California, but I'm here in Texas, and it's a great state, but pertaining to my question, I have a question pertaining with Texas and its state powers.
[02:45:52.173 --> 02:45:53.455]  I believe in equal opportunity.
[02:45:53.455 --> 02:45:55.036]  I believe in the right to bear arms.
[02:45:55.036 --> 02:45:59.641]  I believe in the right for every American student to have a
[02:46:00.373 --> 02:46:00.753]  Fake liberals!
[02:46:24.210 --> 02:46:25.351]  Fake liberals.
[02:46:25.351 --> 02:46:26.411]  Fake liberals, yeah.
[02:46:26.411 --> 02:46:27.992]  Fake liberals, yeah.
[02:46:27.992 --> 02:46:31.114]  I remember because my dad protested against the Iraq War.
[02:46:31.114 --> 02:46:38.398]  He's kind of a hippie and, you know... Well, I was against the Iraq War because it wasn't the country that was involved in the attacks.
[02:46:38.398 --> 02:46:39.879]  Yeah, well, yeah, of course.
[02:46:39.879 --> 02:46:46.563]  And, like, you know, and I see a lot of stuff, like, because there's a bunch of liberal propaganda out there, but there's also a lot of Republican propaganda out there.
[02:46:46.563 --> 02:46:47.223]  Absolutely.
[02:46:47.223 --> 02:46:47.904]  Here's the deal.
[02:46:47.904 --> 02:46:48.304]  Here's the deal.
[02:46:49.575 --> 02:46:54.078]  The Democrats are in power right now, and they're going a million miles an hour into tyranny.
[02:46:54.078 --> 02:47:01.663]  When the Republicans are in power, I'll support the ones that tell the truth, and I'll go after the ones that are tyrants.
[02:47:01.663 --> 02:47:02.683]  It's like Elizabeth Warren.
[02:47:02.683 --> 02:47:04.665]  I don't trust her or like her.
[02:47:04.665 --> 02:47:12.630]  She's anti-gun and the probe and border, but at least she says we should see the TPP treaty that's being rammed through right now for the Pacific Union
[02:47:13.536 --> 02:47:16.138]  And so I say she's better than Hillary.
[02:47:16.138 --> 02:47:19.360]  All I can do is take each case, like is a cop wrong in this case?
[02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:20.421]  Is he right in this case?
[02:47:20.421 --> 02:47:22.583]  Or is a citizen right here or are they wrong?
[02:47:22.583 --> 02:47:27.286]  I mean, I don't just blanketly choose one group or the other.
[02:47:27.286 --> 02:47:29.508]  And then I look at the bigger picture.
[02:47:29.508 --> 02:47:33.531]  But listen, I get the GI Bill and things like that.
[02:47:33.531 --> 02:47:41.796]  The problem is when you get government control of education, what Eisenhower warned of, you get the undue influence of the military-industrial complex.
[02:47:42.617 --> 02:47:54.266]  to basically give people the scholarships and stuff because they owe fealty to the system, and then they worship the government that gave them the discounted education, not the citizens that paid taxes to do it.
[02:47:55.931 --> 02:48:02.057]  You know how many people lose their houses because the IRS claims they didn't pay enough tax when they didn't make enough money to pay for it?
[02:48:02.057 --> 02:48:13.710]  Or how many people get their wages garnished with no judge or jury and then down the road, oh, but we're going to, you know, give some poor immigrant, you know, free hospital and have their baby for 30 grand.
[02:48:13.710 --> 02:48:14.911]  It's robbery.
[02:48:14.911 --> 02:48:16.132]  And long term,
[02:48:17.293 --> 02:48:22.816]  Socialism works up front when you've got a big prosperous country if part of the economy is mixed socialism.
[02:48:22.816 --> 02:48:24.918]  But it always creates special interest.
[02:48:24.918 --> 02:48:36.805]  It always creates a new imperium that hands out the largesse to the different subgroups and it creates a... Oh, what's the term when you hire your family members?
[02:48:36.805 --> 02:48:41.467]  It creates a nepotism, a corporatism writ large.
[02:48:41.467 --> 02:48:43.629]  It just doesn't work.
[02:48:43.629 --> 02:48:43.889]  Go ahead.
[02:48:45.726 --> 02:49:03.882]  But like, you know, oh yeah, and I was gonna say, on top of that, you know, there's Republicans capitalize on Christians, and in the Bible it says there'll be a bunch of false prophets, but you know... Well, sure, I mean, the Republican leadership's for open borders, they're for Obamacare, they're for the TPP, I mean, they tell Obama what to do.
[02:49:03.882 --> 02:49:05.663]  I mean, we know that.
[02:49:05.663 --> 02:49:09.507]  We're not talking about John Boehner, we're talking about people like
[02:49:10.669 --> 02:49:17.839]  Governor Abbott, people like Louie Gummer, people like Rand Paul, and I know all these people.
[02:49:17.839 --> 02:49:18.981]  I know all these people.
[02:49:18.981 --> 02:49:20.163]  They make a big deal about it in the media.
[02:49:20.163 --> 02:49:24.729]  Oh my God, they know the demon, the unspoken one's name, Alex Jones, the straight shooter.
[02:49:24.729 --> 02:49:26.612]  They just hate me because I just straight shoot.
[02:49:27.393 --> 02:49:32.618]  Okay, and these are real men who are aware of the global takeover.
[02:49:32.618 --> 02:49:35.802]  You can disagree with them on abortion or disagree with them on this or that.
[02:49:35.802 --> 02:49:41.007]  They are bucking the system and know there's a planetary takeover.
[02:49:41.007 --> 02:49:43.810]  I mean, listen, we can fight with each other all day about little issues.
[02:49:43.810 --> 02:49:44.731]  They're all little.
[02:49:46.533 --> 02:49:54.498]  Compared to the eugenicist planetary movement financed by the Rothschilds and royalty of the Netherlands and England.
[02:49:54.498 --> 02:49:57.540]  These people have a master plan.
[02:49:57.540 --> 02:49:58.180]  And guess what?
[02:49:58.180 --> 02:50:02.582]  They're carrying it out, my friend.
[02:50:02.582 --> 02:50:09.987]  We can all kill each other later if we want to, but the racism and all of this stuff has got to stop at least until we've defeated the globalists.
[02:50:09.987 --> 02:50:12.688]  Then we can all hate each other, if that's so much fun.
[02:50:12.688 --> 02:50:13.349]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:50:14.761 --> 02:50:16.542]  Yes, I see what you're saying.
[02:50:16.542 --> 02:50:24.447]  But, you know, I think that since I was a liberal, I tell liberals all these other things about like 9-11, the inside job, George Soros.
[02:50:24.447 --> 02:50:29.509]  And, you know, as a college student, I think that we need to really invest into the education, because, man, I'm struggling.
[02:50:29.509 --> 02:50:31.831]  But, sir, listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:50:31.831 --> 02:50:32.371]  I gotta break.
[02:50:32.371 --> 02:50:33.432]  You're a very sincere caller.
[02:50:34.272 --> 02:50:38.235]  Do you understand that our health care was the best in the world and there was no government involvement?
[02:50:38.235 --> 02:50:39.656]  50 years later, it's wrecked.
[02:50:39.656 --> 02:50:43.398]  You put money in the special interest, only give it to select groups.
[02:50:43.398 --> 02:50:49.502]  We spend more on education than anybody else in the world, and you go bankrupt, it's falling apart, there's no jobs for what they train you.
[02:50:49.502 --> 02:50:51.103]  It's a bubble.
[02:50:51.103 --> 02:50:52.184]  I know it's hard for you.
[02:50:52.184 --> 02:50:53.725]  The American Dream's gone, brother.
[02:50:53.725 --> 02:50:55.006]  We gotta get it back.
[02:50:55.006 --> 02:50:56.207]  More government isn't the answer.
[02:50:58.692 --> 02:51:00.472]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[02:51:00.472 --> 02:51:01.793]  How would that make you feel?
[02:51:01.793 --> 02:51:03.513]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[02:51:03.513 --> 02:51:06.053]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[02:51:06.053 --> 02:51:13.615]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[02:51:13.615 --> 02:51:15.115]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[02:51:15.115 --> 02:51:17.855]  Don reports dramatic improvements with hardened body extract.
[02:51:17.855 --> 02:51:23.176]  I started taking hardened body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[02:51:23.176 --> 02:51:28.217]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[02:51:28.397 --> 02:51:33.499]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:33.499 --> 02:51:35.940]  Order at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[02:51:35.940 --> 02:51:37.261]  That's HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[02:51:44.904 --> 02:51:45.986]  I did not expect this at all.
[02:51:45.986 --> 02:51:50.712]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:50.712 --> 02:51:55.979]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:55.979 --> 02:51:57.521]  I want more candy!
[02:51:57.521 --> 02:51:59.624]  I want more video games!
[02:51:59.624 --> 02:51:59.784]  Why?
[02:51:59.784 --> 02:51:59.984]  Why?
[02:51:59.984 --> 02:52:00.145]  Why?
[02:52:01.326 --> 02:52:10.930]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:52:10.930 --> 02:52:13.631]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:52:13.631 --> 02:52:17.192]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:52:17.192 --> 02:52:23.454]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[02:52:23.454 --> 02:52:28.176]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:52:28.476 --> 02:52:34.860]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[02:52:34.860 --> 02:52:42.525]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[02:52:42.525 --> 02:52:49.950]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[02:52:59.041 --> 02:53:00.822]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:53:00.822 --> 02:53:02.483]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:53:02.483 --> 02:53:05.304]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:53:05.304 --> 02:53:07.606]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:53:07.606 --> 02:53:12.109]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[02:54:29.045 --> 02:54:31.967]  We'll have to do overdrive to get to all these callers, as I usually do.
[02:54:31.967 --> 02:54:34.589]  Joshua and others, I'll go to you in just a moment.
[02:54:34.589 --> 02:54:36.250]  Scott in Kentucky, you name it.
[02:54:36.250 --> 02:54:39.012]  Sean, James, Jared.
[02:54:39.012 --> 02:54:43.094]  A lot of calls from Kentucky when we're talking about gardening.
[02:54:43.094 --> 02:54:46.136]  Just there on Spreading the Word.
[02:54:46.136 --> 02:54:47.277]  Look at this story.
[02:54:47.277 --> 02:54:48.498]  I mentioned this, but here it is.
[02:54:48.498 --> 02:54:53.281]  Marx's professor failed students for not denouncing Christian faith in support of feminism.
[02:54:55.461 --> 02:55:00.447]  Biased exam questions Christianity as false, violent, and oppressive to women.
[02:55:00.447 --> 02:55:03.290]  We have a copy of the exam.
[02:55:03.290 --> 02:55:05.032]  A humanities professor reportedly failed.
[02:55:06.317 --> 02:55:12.602]  A Christian student, for not denouncing her faith in support of Marxism, Atheism, and Feminism.
[02:55:12.602 --> 02:55:14.564]  Boy, that's such freedom.
[02:55:14.564 --> 02:55:16.425]  The professor Lance L.J.
[02:55:16.425 --> 02:55:31.718]  Russom of Polk State College in Winter Haven, Florida, reportedly gave the student four straight zeros, there's a copy of that, on assignments because she refused to agree with his biased test questions, which painted Christianity as false, violent, and oppressive to women.
[02:55:32.298 --> 02:55:34.820]  Of course, he'll never talk about radicalism or anything else.
[02:55:34.820 --> 02:55:40.243]  On one exam, the professor asks, and then it goes through just all the craziness.
[02:55:40.243 --> 02:55:44.506]  See it at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:44.506 --> 02:55:48.428]  But that's okay, because Bill Clinton cares about women when he rapes them.
[02:55:48.428 --> 02:55:49.109]  It's alright.
[02:55:51.886 --> 02:55:57.852]  There's a really powerful article from George Washington's blog on Infowars.com that I won't have time to cover, but you should go read it.
[02:55:57.852 --> 02:55:59.934]  America's main problem, corruption.
[02:55:59.934 --> 02:56:01.055]  The cop is on the take.
[02:56:01.055 --> 02:56:05.479]  And we're talking about not the average cop, but like the SEC, the EPA.
[02:56:05.479 --> 02:56:07.200]  It's a really powerful article.
[02:56:08.041 --> 02:56:13.984]  Without all the major regulators, they're like the former heads of the companies that they still own part of.
[02:56:13.984 --> 02:56:16.565]  I mean, it's just, it's just wild.
[02:56:16.565 --> 02:56:18.046]  Speaking of this, it's already started.
[02:56:18.046 --> 02:56:19.327]  We told you it was coming.
[02:56:19.327 --> 02:56:21.808]  They're like, by 2030, we'll start having driverless cars.
[02:56:21.808 --> 02:56:23.349]  They tell you that to make you go to sleep.
[02:56:23.349 --> 02:56:24.510]  It's already here.
[02:56:24.510 --> 02:56:28.031]  World's first self-driving truck takes the highways in Nevada.
[02:56:28.031 --> 02:56:32.854]  State-certified, two Freightliner inspection trucks to mix with regular traffic on public roads.
[02:56:33.973 --> 02:56:43.476]  And they're going to say it went great, and then they're going to roll everything out and say they're better than humans, and then raise the insurance until it's so expensive you can't drive anymore.
[02:56:43.476 --> 02:56:47.177]  And then everything is surveilled and tracked and taxed in their own words.
[02:56:47.177 --> 02:56:49.777]  The circle is now complete.
[02:56:49.777 --> 02:56:52.318]  The panoptagon is in control.
[02:56:52.318 --> 02:56:54.258]  Humans are domesticated.
[02:56:54.258 --> 02:56:59.420]  Planetary extermination to commence.
[02:56:59.420 --> 02:57:02.921]  Global plan to merge with the AI initiated.
[02:57:05.723 --> 02:57:07.085]  That's it for basic news.
[02:57:07.085 --> 02:57:10.308]  I'm gonna go to break, come back and take four or five calls in the overdrive.
[02:57:10.308 --> 02:57:10.669]  Briefly!
[02:57:12.142 --> 02:57:13.743]  We are illicitly supported.
[02:57:13.743 --> 02:57:28.192]  We have a really fundamentally game-changing, simple, concentrated, hardcore, nation iodine, the good halogen, the super male vitality, more than 10 products we've developed now, and it's back in after almost three months.
[02:57:28.192 --> 02:57:30.734]  Super female vitality, right on time.
[02:57:30.734 --> 02:57:34.076]  We can guarantee shipping where they'll get it next week.
[02:57:34.076 --> 02:57:36.177]  I don't know whether they're able to pass, but they'll get it in the mail.
[02:57:36.177 --> 02:57:38.799]  Say, mom, or honey, or whatever, it's in the mail.
[02:57:40.732 --> 02:57:48.762]  Libido, energy, these are things from my research and what I've personally experienced that counteract all the sluggishness of the soft kill weapons that are out there.
[02:57:48.762 --> 02:57:57.854]  Super Female Vitality is available at InfoWarsLife.com and when you purchase it and try it,
[02:57:59.028 --> 02:58:02.350]  Most people end up repurchasing because it really is the real deal.
[02:58:02.350 --> 02:58:05.851]  But most importantly, you support the broadcast and everything we're doing.
[02:58:05.851 --> 02:58:14.916]  Infowarslife.com or Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:58:14.916 --> 02:58:17.757]  Child-ease, the child calming formula is there.
[02:58:17.757 --> 02:58:22.079]  Winter Sun, a super high quality vitamin D3, truly organic.
[02:58:22.079 --> 02:58:23.080]  Secret 12, vitamin B12.
[02:58:25.143 --> 02:58:28.504]  Infowarslife.com or Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:28.504 --> 02:58:30.425]  And don't forget, you can become a presentplanet.tv member.
[02:58:30.425 --> 02:58:33.466]  20 people can use it and see the nightly news.
[02:58:33.466 --> 02:58:35.347]  Well, it's the final countdown.
[02:58:35.347 --> 02:58:37.867]  Until tomorrow with the main radio broadcast.
[02:58:37.867 --> 02:58:39.988]  I now go into overdrive for calls.
[02:58:39.988 --> 02:58:41.569]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:41.569 --> 02:58:45.190]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:48.584 --> 02:58:49.945]  I want more candy!
[02:58:49.945 --> 02:58:51.226]  I want more video games!
[02:58:51.226 --> 02:58:51.706]  Mine!
[02:58:51.706 --> 02:58:51.846]  Mine!
[02:58:51.846 --> 02:58:51.946]  Mine!
[02:59:18.524 --> 02:59:19.285]  I think so.
[02:59:50.583 --> 02:59:53.207]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:09.543 --> 03:00:11.064]  Fix bayonets.
[03:00:11.064 --> 03:00:13.446]  We are now entering overdrive.
[03:00:13.446 --> 03:00:18.631]  With your host, Alex Jones broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:18.631 --> 03:00:22.294]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:24.431 --> 03:00:31.255]  We don't really screen your calls, but to make sure your phone sounds good and get your name and where you're calling from and how you're listening, if you want to volunteer it, but I have a problem.
[03:00:31.255 --> 03:00:35.157]  I don't tend to read what people are volunteering until I look up on the screen.
[03:00:35.157 --> 03:00:36.758]  Joshua disagrees.
[03:00:36.758 --> 03:00:42.421]  Should have gone to Joshua a while back, because, you know, I put disagreers to have the line normally if I have time.
[03:00:42.421 --> 03:00:43.441]  Joshua, you're on the air.
[03:00:43.441 --> 03:00:44.862]  Thank you for holding.
[03:00:44.862 --> 03:00:45.763]  Tell me how you disagree.
[03:00:45.763 --> 03:00:46.023]  Go ahead.
[03:00:47.634 --> 03:01:02.144]  Okay, so the Second Amendment, the first part of it has to do with the states basically organizing and training the militias, but that's already basically been repealed because the National Guard, which that essentially was, has been merged with the Department of the Army.
[03:01:02.144 --> 03:01:03.946]  That's already effectively been repealed.
[03:01:03.946 --> 03:01:14.293]  The second part of the Second Amendment, which is the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, basically, that... The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[03:01:15.737 --> 03:01:23.164]  It's already infringed when the courts with the Constitutional Republic can then decide on the law that's written.
[03:01:23.164 --> 03:01:28.570]  When they can decide whether something is being infringed or not, they've already... Sure, sure, sure.
[03:01:28.570 --> 03:01:33.415]  Well, there's always an argument that, you know, that slavery's been going on a long time, so it's okay.
[03:01:33.415 --> 03:01:34.376]  Here's the deal.
[03:01:34.376 --> 03:01:38.500]  Do you agree with the fundamental right of a human or any other creature to defend itself?
[03:01:40.239 --> 03:01:42.500]  Yes.
[03:01:42.500 --> 03:01:44.780]  So your problem isn't with the Second Amendment.
[03:01:44.780 --> 03:01:49.422]  Your problem is it's not strong enough.
[03:01:49.422 --> 03:01:53.823]  I think the problem is the way that it is presented.
[03:01:53.823 --> 03:02:00.225]  It's allowing the courts to then say, well, no, you can't have this, no, you can't have that.
[03:02:00.225 --> 03:02:03.326]  Well, that's our problem because the founders were all clear it's an individual right.
[03:02:04.824 --> 03:02:08.345]  For the security of our free people, the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[03:02:19.929 --> 03:02:26.711]  You know, that mid-level English in between old and new English gets confusing for people, but it's like the First Amendment.
[03:02:26.711 --> 03:02:35.594]  Congress shall make no law respecting and establishing a religion, or any free exercise thereof, or the press, or the people to petition the government for redress of grievances.
[03:02:35.594 --> 03:02:36.714]  It's all in there.
[03:02:36.714 --> 03:02:41.555]  There's a militia clause, there's an individual clause, it's all there.
[03:02:41.555 --> 03:02:46.497]  The First Amendment's the better battle for the Second Amendment, to be honest with you, and I think it has to do with the
[03:02:47.712 --> 03:03:04.863]  Uh, the free practice, basically, of religion, and it goes back to the Bible of the whole point of sell your tunic and buy a sword and two should be enough, because basically, and it doesn't explicitly say this, but I understand what it's talking about, you've got two hands, of course you should have two swords, you should always be armed, kind of a thing like that.
[03:03:05.740 --> 03:03:13.447]  Now, the other side of that is not that you should be armed, but you can go around and act like some of these crazy shooters that go and shoot up places.
[03:03:13.447 --> 03:03:16.590]  Well, they're crazy, so that doesn't affect other people that haven't done anything wrong.
[03:03:16.590 --> 03:03:21.995]  It's like saying somebody killed somebody with a car drunk driving, so every other driver has to be guilty for what they've done.
[03:03:21.995 --> 03:03:22.736]  It's asinine.
[03:03:22.736 --> 03:03:23.496]  I gotta jump.
[03:03:23.496 --> 03:03:24.217]  I hear your points.
[03:03:27.654 --> 03:03:29.195]  There's nothing perfect in this world.
[03:03:29.195 --> 03:03:32.556]  The elite are coming after the guns to dominate and enslave us.
[03:03:32.556 --> 03:03:33.737]  It's that simple.
[03:03:33.737 --> 03:03:34.437]  It's a fact.
[03:03:34.437 --> 03:03:35.938]  America is getting that.
[03:03:35.938 --> 03:03:37.598]  The world is getting that.
[03:03:37.598 --> 03:03:40.279]  We're winning the info war in every metric.
[03:03:40.279 --> 03:03:43.421]  That's why they're launching a counteroffensive to shut us up.
[03:03:43.421 --> 03:03:47.182]  James in Colorado, go ahead.
[03:03:47.182 --> 03:03:48.163]  Gosh, very quickly, Alex.
[03:03:49.628 --> 03:03:53.715]  With Jade Helm, I look up maybe the cyber operation aspect.
[03:03:53.715 --> 03:04:00.607]  I've been reading some news articles where they're finding LinkedIn accounts with a screenshot with cyber slash IO banners for exercise Jade Helm.
[03:04:00.607 --> 03:04:03.492]  But I also sent Joe Biggs a tweet that he favorited.
[03:04:04.222 --> 03:04:05.984]  Uh, and I just emailed you the video.
[03:04:05.984 --> 03:04:06.604]  It's U.S.
[03:04:06.604 --> 03:04:09.727]  military to operate domestically during Ebola outbreak.
[03:04:09.727 --> 03:04:10.848]  It's like a two-minute video.
[03:04:10.848 --> 03:04:13.191]  You skip to the 107 mark and play it.
[03:04:13.191 --> 03:04:17.054]  The military said, oh yeah, we're training constantly with locals.
[03:04:17.054 --> 03:04:17.715]  It's in Texas.
[03:04:17.715 --> 03:04:21.959]  They're training, but they're saying we're going to respond within 72 hours anywhere in the U.S.
[03:04:23.937 --> 03:04:24.759]  We'll look into it.
[03:04:24.759 --> 03:04:25.440]  We're out of time.
[03:04:25.440 --> 03:04:27.164]  I'm sorry to the other callers.
[03:04:27.164 --> 03:04:28.626]  Scott, Jared, and Sean and others.
[03:04:28.626 --> 03:04:30.029]  We'll get back to you tomorrow.
[03:04:30.029 --> 03:04:31.953]  Look at these headlines on Drudge Report.
[03:04:31.953 --> 03:04:34.778]  UN bans press from panel on press freedom.
[03:04:36.181 --> 03:04:40.043]  Iranian general, war with the USA would be no big deal.
[03:04:40.043 --> 03:04:41.944]  That's hilarious.
[03:04:41.944 --> 03:04:44.666]  That's just some of the news on that front.
[03:04:44.666 --> 03:04:50.930]  Appeals court rules, NSA's collection of phone records, not authorized by the Patriot Act.
[03:04:50.930 --> 03:04:54.812]  That's just some of what's on InfoWars.com, DrudgeReport.com.
[03:04:54.812 --> 03:04:56.493]  In the Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock.
