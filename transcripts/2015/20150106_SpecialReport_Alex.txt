[00:00:09.607 --> 00:00:15.810]  I think now they're less worried about the damage they can cause with mercury and squalene, both toxic chemicals.
[00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.331]  Squalene has never been approved for use.
[00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:22.233]  And they're more worried that they could lose the whole program.
[00:00:22.253 --> 00:00:23.333]  What do you mean the whole program?
[00:00:23.353 --> 00:00:27.235]  The polio, the DPT, the measles, mumps, and rubella.
[00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:31.217]  Because once people start doubting, all of a sudden the truth starts coming out.
[00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:34.023]  Well, sir, I know three years ago you looked at the trials.
[00:00:34.043 --> 00:00:34.744]  I covered it.
[00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:36.046]  I had other medical doctors on.
[00:00:36.086 --> 00:00:43.959]  I had families, women whose children had died on the show just in the trials with the HPV shot.
[00:00:44.693 --> 00:00:49.235]  So what caused the 12-year-old's life to be cut so tragically short?
[00:00:49.535 --> 00:00:53.557]  A few hours before she died, Meredith was complaining of a sore throat.
[00:00:53.977 --> 00:00:55.458]  Her mom took her to the doctor.
[00:00:55.738 --> 00:01:00.300]  While there, the 12-year-old also got the first round of the HPV vaccine.
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.023]  When I came home, she had just grown up and was non-responsive on my living room floor.
[00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:09.664]  I performed CPR.
[00:01:10.064 --> 00:01:13.906]  She was taken to Waukesha Memorial, where she died.
[00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:18.919]  And now the FDA comes out last week and says, yeah, we may put a warning out on this.
[00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:23.222]  From your medical research, why is that shot killing people?
[00:01:23.763 --> 00:01:32.590]  Well, you know, I think all of them are, but this one is more remarkable because you're dealing with teenage, young teenage girls.
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.500]  I think?
[00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:55.380]  Stalin said it the best.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.421]  The death of one person is a tragedy.
[00:01:57.761 --> 00:01:59.822]  The death of 10,000 is a statistic.
[00:02:00.323 --> 00:02:05.846]  Without a doubt in my mind, I believe vaccinations triggered Evan's autism.
[00:02:06.658 --> 00:02:15.021]  Medical study after medical study has said this is junk science, including a recent one of nearly a thousand children in the Journal of Pediatrics, and a lot of moms watched the view.
[00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:19.683]  I don't know whether she'll be talking about it on the air, but it does have an effect.
[00:02:20.463 --> 00:02:27.746]  These scare stories about vaccines have had an impact on some parents deciding to delay or not to vaccinate their children at all.
[00:02:28.544 --> 00:02:34.547]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:40.390]  You know, in the United States, the only vaccine that's still in is for pregnant women.
[00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:45.453]  I can say confidently, I do think thimerosal causes tics.
[00:02:45.913 --> 00:02:48.554]  So I don't know why they still give it to pregnant women.
[00:02:48.594 --> 00:02:51.956]  Like, that's the last person I would give mercury to.
[00:02:51.976 --> 00:02:55.258]  Thimerosal from vaccines cause tics.
[00:02:56.351 --> 00:02:59.354]  You start a campaign and you just make that your mantra.
[00:03:00.094 --> 00:03:03.757]  Do you think a pregnant mother would want to take a vaccine that they knew caused tics?
[00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:05.339]  Absolutely not!
[00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.683]  I would never give my wife a vaccine that I thought caused tics.
[00:03:10.403 --> 00:03:14.607]  I can say tics are four times more prevalent in children with autism.
[00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:18.170]  There is biologic plausibility right now to say that.
[00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:34.099]  The vaccines are given at pediatric wellness visits and the idea is that you are training a parent to bring their child in at all the pediatric wellness visits.
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.942]  We haven't had a very collective notion of these are our children.
[00:03:38.202 --> 00:03:46.107]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:03:46.487 --> 00:03:51.490]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making better investments.
[00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.976]  There is a very interesting phenomenon, rather like the antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
[00:03:57.456 --> 00:04:06.066]  We're seeing this now emerge in vaccine technology, that we're getting bacteria, pertussis for example, that is resistant to the current vaccine in use.
[00:04:06.807 --> 00:04:08.208]  Now what that means...
[00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:18.636]  Is that we see these escape mutants, these mutants that are then resistant to the current vaccine, so they will introduce a new vaccine that deals, at least temporarily, with that escape mutant.
[00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:20.137]  That causes another super mutant.
[00:04:20.357 --> 00:04:30.405]  Well, the problem is that you're on a treadmill for the rest of time, because not only will children have to have the existing pertussis vaccine,
[00:04:31.547 --> 00:04:33.208]  But they will also have to have the new one.
[00:04:33.348 --> 00:04:34.489]  So it's Pandora's Box?
[00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:40.674]  Yes, I think people didn't think through this, and they didn't think through it with antibiotics, and they didn't think through it with vaccines.
[00:04:40.754 --> 00:04:45.637]  But we're starting to see the emergence of these super strains now, and we need to be very, very careful.
[00:04:46.298 --> 00:04:47.398]  All of a sudden it's not working.
[00:04:47.438 --> 00:04:49.780]  They no longer can just say it, and that's true.
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.301]  Chicago politics at its best.
[00:04:51.702 --> 00:04:55.264]  Just say it enough, say the lie enough times, and people will believe it.
[00:04:55.304 --> 00:04:58.566]  I mean, I think that it's just so out of control.
[00:04:58.947 --> 00:05:00.188]  And I wanted to know that autism,
[00:05:00.988 --> 00:05:06.931]  Of all the things in my 30 plus years in medicine, I've never seen anything as devastating to a family.
[00:05:07.392 --> 00:05:09.153]  Cancer, nothing compared to that.
[00:05:09.433 --> 00:05:10.353]  Heart disease, nothing.
[00:05:10.573 --> 00:05:12.695]  Those children are alive, they just have a shortened life.
[00:05:13.215 --> 00:05:15.396]  Autism, the parents have no life.
[00:05:15.796 --> 00:05:16.517]  No life.
[00:05:16.857 --> 00:05:20.719]  And these are the most brave parents in the world who take care of these children.
[00:05:33.683 --> 00:05:34.524]  The facts are in.
[00:05:34.704 --> 00:05:35.824]  The studies are legion.
[00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:43.470]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.092]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:05:47.452 --> 00:05:47.872]  Simple.
[00:05:48.033 --> 00:05:52.456]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:05:52.756 --> 00:05:55.978]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet.
[00:05:56.158 --> 00:05:58.220]  But we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.825]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[00:06:04.006 --> 00:06:14.516]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
