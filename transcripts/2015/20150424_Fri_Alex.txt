[00:00:04.997 --> 00:00:06.318]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.318 --> 00:00:08.080]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.862]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.862 --> 00:00:11.423]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.423 --> 00:00:12.984]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.984 --> 00:00:17.168]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.168 --> 00:00:21.192]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.324]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday, August 24, 2015.
[00:00:30.324 --> 00:00:32.245]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[00:00:32.245 --> 00:00:35.088]  We're going to have a report at the bottom of the hour from Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.088 --> 00:00:38.151]  We're also going to be joined in the second hour, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:00:38.151 --> 00:00:41.575]  And in the third hour, we're going to be talking to John Rapoport.
[00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:48.196]  And of course we're going to be talking to him about GMOs, about vaccines, mandatory vaccines.
[00:00:48.196 --> 00:00:51.659]  There's an interesting article that was on Lou Rockwell.
[00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:58.446]  It was written by someone who said they were at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center with their daughter.
[00:00:58.446 --> 00:01:01.909]  They said there was an antibiotic-resistant bacteria that was there at the time.
[00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:02.970]  Seven people were infected.
[00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.771]  Two of them died.
[00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:06.446]  So that's about a 14% casualty rate.
[00:01:06.446 --> 00:01:12.271]  He said me and a daughter were fine, but they thought they would see something about it in the news.
[00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:16.855]  Instead, everybody was panicked about measles, which hasn't killed anybody yet.
[00:01:16.855 --> 00:01:24.602]  But of course, he talks about how absurd this whole narrative has become about mandatory vaccines destroying our informed consent.
[00:01:25.282 --> 00:01:27.763]  It talks about imagining the playbook.
[00:01:27.763 --> 00:01:30.524]  We're going to talk about that in the next segment as well.
[00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:39.666]  Of course, there's a couple of stories we're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson about PayPal asserting copyright ownership over all intellectual property of its users.
[00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:45.028]  And a story that I'm actually a little bit a part of, the SPLC, has come out.
[00:01:46.016 --> 00:01:54.420]  Attacking the Oath Keepers who are protecting the minors from the BLM, making sure they're going to get their due process in court.
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.901]  They're trying to paint them as terrorists, as usual.
[00:01:56.901 --> 00:02:03.764]  Of course, I did a video a while back, you'll see that at the bottom of the article, SPLC, Prophets of Hate.
[00:02:04.664 --> 00:02:07.427]  Uh, P-R-O-F-I-T-S.
[00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:08.489]  That kind of profit.
[00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.451]  Not, uh, saying what's going to be coming out.
[00:02:10.451 --> 00:02:15.176]  Of course, we, uh, uh, go with some comparisons there you can see in that, uh, thumbnail.
[00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:19.601]  Uh, I've got Morris Dease and his sidekick there as Jim and Tammy Faye Baker.
[00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:21.402]  We, we crossfade that in there because
[00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:30.527]  That's the way they've been referred to by people on the left, as the Jim and Tammy Faye Baker of the Civil Rights Movement, trying to cash in on everything.
[00:02:30.527 --> 00:02:33.448]  And that's really what the Southern Poverty Law Center is about.
[00:02:33.448 --> 00:02:36.149]  When they say hate watch, they're inspiring hate.
[00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:38.550]  They're inspiring hate of Christians.
[00:02:39.565 --> 00:02:47.131]  Of people who believe we ought to have a limited constitutional government, of people like the ones in Oregon who think they ought to have due process.
[00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:55.118]  What started this whole thing in Oregon, and of course that's the video that I have there, when I talked to someone there in the mining community,
[00:02:55.658 --> 00:02:58.661]  This is something that goes back to the mid-1800s.
[00:02:58.661 --> 00:02:59.742]  These are property rights.
[00:02:59.742 --> 00:03:08.409]  When you have mining rights, when you have grazing rights, when you have hunting rights, these are things that are property, just as much as your home is property.
[00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.812]  This is the way these people make their living, to have a clear title.
[00:03:11.812 --> 00:03:19.478]  Yet, because there was a dispute there, it is not a paperwork dispute, as they portray it in the article from the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:03:19.478 --> 00:03:20.880]  When they had this dispute,
[00:03:21.966 --> 00:03:28.912]  They decided they were going to just shut these guys down because they were challenged, asked why they were on the property by one of the caretakers.
[00:03:28.912 --> 00:03:31.134]  They got offended by that.
[00:03:31.134 --> 00:03:33.477]  That's what you'll see in that interview.
[00:03:33.477 --> 00:03:38.801]  And so they decided that they would just shut the whole operation down and they weren't going to let this go through the courts.
[00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:41.163]  They had a deadline of tomorrow.
[00:03:41.163 --> 00:03:48.130]  They said, shut your mind down, get out of there, get your equipment out, take your buildings down and fill up the holes.
[00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.650]  That's right.
[00:04:09.711 --> 00:04:16.717]  I'm sure what they want to do is run all of these miners who've been there for 150 years out of there so they can turn it over some big multinational corporation.
[00:04:16.717 --> 00:04:17.978]  That's probably the endgame.
[00:04:17.978 --> 00:04:23.903]  That's what they were doing in Nevada, running the ranchers out there who had had grazing rights for 150 years, many of them.
[00:04:25.744 --> 00:04:30.707]  So basically, Oath Keepers showed up, not as a confrontation, but as security.
[00:04:30.707 --> 00:04:35.590]  Just to make sure that they weren't going to attack them and force this issue.
[00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.391]  And now it's going to go through the courts, apparently.
[00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:38.812]  We're glad to see that.
[00:04:38.812 --> 00:04:41.234]  And we're going to talk about that with Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:04:41.234 --> 00:04:45.356]  We're going to talk a little bit about the Southern Poverty Law Center's history as well when we come back.
[00:04:45.356 --> 00:04:46.517]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.501]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:03.382]  Obama and Saudi support al-Qaeda in Yemen.
[00:05:03.382 --> 00:05:09.104]  According to corporate media reports, the Saudis are worried about recent advances in war-torn Yemen.
[00:05:09.104 --> 00:05:12.045]  Also, Alex Jones vs. the mainstream media.
[00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:25.830]  This is posted by NoMoreFilms, a documentary film from NoMoreFilms exposing the mainstream media's propaganda campaign to ridicule the undisputed king of conspiracy talk radio, Alex Jones, and his website, Infowars.
[00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.090]  If you want reality, you have

[00:06:58.856 --> 00:06:59.957]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:06:59.957 --> 00:07:04.201]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds.
[00:07:04.201 --> 00:07:06.323]  I lift weights five days a week.
[00:07:06.323 --> 00:07:07.985]  I can swim two, three miles.
[00:07:07.985 --> 00:07:11.148]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[00:07:11.148 --> 00:07:13.110]  I started an access television show.
[00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:18.495]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[00:07:18.495 --> 00:07:21.358]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:27.941]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut.
[00:07:27.941 --> 00:07:33.183]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[00:07:33.183 --> 00:07:38.065]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[00:07:38.345 --> 00:07:45.769]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Groot for InfoWarsLife.com, the results were incredible.

[00:08:08.946 --> 00:08:11.591]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:13.334]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:18.444 --> 00:08:20.685]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday, August 24, 2015.
[00:08:20.685 --> 00:08:23.886]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[00:08:23.886 --> 00:08:26.926]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us in the second hour.
[00:08:26.926 --> 00:08:30.207]  We're going to be talking about a couple of articles that are up on Infowars.com.
[00:08:30.207 --> 00:08:38.990]  SPLC accuses Oath Keepers of inciting armed confrontation over the Sugar Pine Mine, as well as an article that just went up a few minutes ago.
[00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:44.492]  PayPal asserts copyright ownership over all intellectual property of its users.
[00:08:44.492 --> 00:08:45.812]  They've got a new users agreement.
[00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:49.273]  You know, kind of like what the federal government does with the Constitution.
[00:08:49.273 --> 00:08:54.655]  They just say, oh, by the way, we've just arbitrarily amended that.
[00:08:54.655 --> 00:08:56.095]  Sometimes they don't even tell you.
[00:08:56.095 --> 00:08:57.576]  Oftentimes they don't tell you.
[00:08:57.576 --> 00:09:01.137]  So that's what the corporations do as well, because they're kind of...
[00:09:01.997 --> 00:09:07.199]  Two heads of the same snake, and it is a two-headed snake, the government and the large corporations.
[00:09:07.199 --> 00:09:14.761]  Also in the news, we have Hillary Furious, as thousands of Americans are sending cigars to her office.
[00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:22.664]  There's an organization called Send Clinton Cigars, where you can anonymously purchase cigars and have them directly mailed to Hillary.
[00:09:23.325 --> 00:09:25.790]  And tens of thousands of people have done that.
[00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:31.803]  You can see that picture of the massive stack of cigars they've got waiting to go to Hillary.
[00:09:31.803 --> 00:09:33.187]  And they have a subtitle...
[00:09:34.421 --> 00:09:34.861]  I don't
[00:09:55.401 --> 00:09:56.842]  It's basically not even an attack.
[00:09:56.842 --> 00:10:02.105]  It's just an exposure of what's been going on with the Clinton Foundation.
[00:10:02.105 --> 00:10:06.407]  Chelsea came back and said, our foundation is as transparent as any foundation.
[00:10:06.407 --> 00:10:10.309]  And we say, yeah, transparently criminal.
[00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:11.269]  It's Reuters.
[00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:17.773]  Other people have been conducting investigations showing that they had falsified the transparent reports that they put out there.
[00:10:19.307 --> 00:10:27.454]  If you put out a report and you say, look, I'm transparent and the information on the report is a lie, what do we make of that?
[00:10:27.454 --> 00:10:30.477]  I guess that's kind of standard operating procedure for the Clintons, isn't it?
[00:10:31.963 --> 00:10:38.805]  Also, we see the rich and powerful continue to get by with nothing happening to them.
[00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:45.006]  We have Petraeus, just as I said yesterday, don't bet on him getting sentenced any time.
[00:10:45.006 --> 00:10:48.547]  He had pled guilty and they had the sentencing hearing yesterday.
[00:10:48.547 --> 00:10:50.468]  And I said he's not going to do any jail time.
[00:10:50.468 --> 00:10:52.348]  He's going to be at Bilderberg this year.
[00:10:52.348 --> 00:10:53.609]  And guess what?
[00:10:53.609 --> 00:10:57.470]  He got two years probation.
[00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.150]  Okay?
[00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.530]  Imagine.
[00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:02.678]  We have John Kiriakou who exposed torture in the CIA.
[00:11:02.678 --> 00:11:06.928]  He gets two years in prison, but Petraeus gets two years probation.
[00:11:08.154 --> 00:11:14.517]  We have people like Manning who exposed criminal actions by the CIA going through WikiLeaks.
[00:11:14.517 --> 00:11:16.878]  He gets put in jail for a very long time.
[00:11:16.878 --> 00:11:24.822]  But of course, Petraeus gives books of information to his mistress to help her, to impress her, whatever.
[00:11:24.822 --> 00:11:26.443]  So he gets absolutely nothing.
[00:11:26.443 --> 00:11:27.404]  But he did get a fine.
[00:11:27.404 --> 00:11:29.745]  And boy, the judge got really rough on him.
[00:11:29.745 --> 00:11:31.126]  He more than doubled the fine.
[00:11:31.846 --> 00:11:33.967]  They thought he was going to get a $40,000 fine.
[00:11:33.967 --> 00:11:37.449]  Instead, he got hammered, hammered with a $100,000 fine.
[00:11:37.449 --> 00:11:49.495]  And to put that in perspective, Antiwar.com says, well, to send a message, the judge sentences David Petraeus to 75% of one of his speaking fees.
[00:11:49.495 --> 00:11:54.077]  Yeah, he gets paid, according to Speakerpedia, he gets paid up to $132,750 for each speech.
[00:11:54.077 --> 00:11:55.578]  So there, I guess he could maybe deliver a speech about
[00:12:01.946 --> 00:12:04.407]  I don't know, maybe about this leak that he's got.
[00:12:04.407 --> 00:12:07.308]  Some of the interesting tweets that came out about this, interesting comments.
[00:12:07.308 --> 00:12:11.710]  One person in particular, Jessalyn Radick, and she has a government accountability project.
[00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.770]  She was Ed Snowden's lawyer.
[00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:18.192]  She's also represented other whistleblowers like Thomas Drake.
[00:12:18.192 --> 00:12:20.333]  I don't know if she represented William Binney.
[00:12:20.333 --> 00:12:22.814]  She also represented John Kiriakou, I believe.
[00:12:23.474 --> 00:12:36.078]  She herself was an ethics lawyer within the Department of Justice, and when she did her job exposing that the FBI had violated due process in a high-profile case, the Department of Justice suppressed that.
[00:12:36.078 --> 00:12:41.259]  And so as an ethics lawyer, she became a whistleblower herself, and now she is representing whistleblowers.
[00:12:41.259 --> 00:12:42.380]  She commented on Twitter and said,
[00:12:43.348 --> 00:12:47.591]  And so Petraeus can travel outside the U.S., unlike John Kiriakou.
[00:12:47.591 --> 00:12:49.413]  Yeah, because he's going to travel to Bilderberg.
[00:12:49.413 --> 00:12:50.453]  Can't keep him from that.
[00:12:50.453 --> 00:12:53.155]  I mean, he's become a regular attendee there at Bilderberg.
[00:12:53.155 --> 00:12:55.817]  He's been there the last two or three years.
[00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:58.639]  I know at least two years he's been there.
[00:12:58.639 --> 00:13:01.802]  Kiriakou can't attend his son's graduation.
[00:13:01.802 --> 00:13:04.664]  And he can't accept international invitations to speak.
[00:13:04.664 --> 00:13:07.246]  He's basically not allowed to leave the country.
[00:13:07.246 --> 00:13:11.409]  And she also points out that Petraeus is not even going to have to give up his guns.
[00:13:12.452 --> 00:13:17.203]  She said he'll probably, in a little bit of sarcasm, receive a pardon, a parade, and a postage stamp.
[00:13:17.203 --> 00:13:19.809]  Well, for sure we know that he's a presidential advisor.
[00:13:20.783 --> 00:13:23.265]  And he's going to probably increase in that role.
[00:13:23.265 --> 00:13:24.365]  So there you go.
[00:13:24.365 --> 00:13:26.987]  One standard for them and another standard for everybody else.
[00:13:26.987 --> 00:13:35.412]  It's kind of like all these politicians who admit that they smoked marijuana as part of a youthful indiscretion.
[00:13:35.412 --> 00:13:37.494]  And we all should just let that go.
[00:13:37.494 --> 00:13:40.556]  But, you know, they're not going to let any youths go.
[00:13:40.556 --> 00:13:43.417]  They're going to send people to jail for a very long time.
[00:13:43.417 --> 00:13:45.359]  They're going to ruin other people's lives.
[00:13:45.359 --> 00:13:48.821]  But, of course, if it's done within the families of the rich and powerful,
[00:13:49.201 --> 00:13:50.992]  Well, let's just move on.
[00:13:50.992 --> 00:13:51.797]  There's nothing to see.
[00:13:53.291 --> 00:14:01.396]  None of these guys will even consider allowing something like marijuana to be used medically, even though they used it recreationally.
[00:14:01.396 --> 00:14:06.460]  And I'm talking about you, Jeb Bush, especially you, who fought this in Florida.
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:10.482]  But of course, Sheldon Adelson was in that as well.
[00:14:10.482 --> 00:14:17.687]  He pretty much funded this effort to shut down medical marijuana in the last election, almost single-handedly provided all the money.
[00:14:17.687 --> 00:14:22.410]  And of course, Sheldon Adelson, if you don't know who he is, he's a Las Vegas casino owner who
[00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.654]  Seems to be able to get whatever he wants from the Republican Party.
[00:14:26.654 --> 00:14:35.523]  He made massive contributions to Lindsey Graham, and Lindsey Graham put through a bill to stop online gambling because, you know, that'd be competition to Sheldon Adelson.
[00:14:35.523 --> 00:14:40.008]  I wonder why he got involved in a medical marijuana issue so heavily in Florida.
[00:14:40.008 --> 00:14:40.749]  Does he consider
[00:14:41.758 --> 00:14:48.583]  The possibility that people might use marijuana recreationally, because that was not even on the ballot there.
[00:14:48.583 --> 00:14:53.886]  Does he consider recreational use of marijuana to be a competition to his racket?
[00:14:53.886 --> 00:14:54.367]  To gambling?
[00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:58.696]  And of course, they talk about the Sheldon Adelson primary.
[00:14:58.696 --> 00:15:12.629]  Everybody was talking about how all these candidates were going by in the Republican Party, because he spent between $90 and $100 million in the 2008 election, first backing Newt Gingrich, then backing Mitt Romney.
[00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:17.734]  So he didn't really, he's not very good at picking winners, even though he runs a casino.
[00:15:18.494 --> 00:15:35.843]  Okay, so but still it's a lot of money he can make a lot of campaigns and if people remember what happened in the real Sheldon primary When Ron Paul backers were essentially blocked from going they said that this basically they had a caucus in Clark County in Nevada
[00:15:36.923 --> 00:15:41.988]  And that's pretty much the entire population of Nevada lives in Clark County.
[00:15:41.988 --> 00:15:42.368]  It's huge.
[00:15:42.368 --> 00:15:48.854]  It goes from Las Vegas all the way up to the Bundy Ranch and elsewhere, but most of the population is in that one county.
[00:15:48.854 --> 00:15:55.720]  And they had a caucus, and so he said, well, this is going to conflict with, it was on a Saturday night, I think.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.661]  That was going to conflict with Jewish people going.
[00:15:58.661 --> 00:16:04.345]  So they were going to have a Jewish only primary on Sunday and they tried to keep people out.
[00:16:04.345 --> 00:16:09.528]  And of course there were people who had reasons besides the Sabbath that they couldn't attend that primary.
[00:16:09.528 --> 00:16:14.951]  It was absolutely outrageous the games and the criminal games that they played in that primary.
[00:16:14.951 --> 00:16:18.433]  But of course now they're back in the open and there's been a lot of talk about how
[00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:40.589]  Sheldon Adelson, the Koch brothers are openly picking candidates and the money that's at stake there is so important that these primaries, these little private hearings that they're having with the billionaires, are perhaps more important than winning some of these small primaries in some of the smaller states.
[00:16:40.589 --> 00:16:44.871]  And so we have to ask, is this an election or is it a selection?
[00:16:46.235 --> 00:16:47.095]  And as H.L.
[00:16:47.095 --> 00:16:51.936]  Mencken said, and we've repeated this many times, an election is an advanced auction of stolen goods.
[00:16:51.936 --> 00:16:54.137]  We can certainly see that with the politicians that are there.
[00:16:54.137 --> 00:17:05.319]  And of course, the author who is coming out with this book showing the Clinton cash and how that has moved around is also working on an expose of Jeb Bush.
[00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:09.220]  It should be a target-rich environment, I imagine.
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:14.541]  Also in the news, we see that the economy apparently is not too good, especially if you're selling
[00:17:15.969 --> 00:17:18.131]  Heavily processed, adulterated food.
[00:17:18.131 --> 00:17:20.532]  McDonald's is closing 700 stores.
[00:17:20.532 --> 00:17:24.975]  This is a story that went viral on Infowars.com from Kit Daniels.
[00:17:24.975 --> 00:17:30.939]  They say that the fast food giant quietly closed 350 stores in the first quarter.
[00:17:30.939 --> 00:17:37.723]  So that brings up about a thousand stores in just the first quarter or so of this year.
[00:17:38.303 --> 00:17:47.866]  To put that in perspective, McDonald's has 35,000 stores worldwide, so that's about 3% of their stores they're closing in the first quarter and looking at now.
[00:17:47.866 --> 00:17:54.588]  And of course, one of the reasons is an 11% decline in revenue, a 30% drop in profit for the first three months of the year.
[00:17:54.588 --> 00:18:02.311]  We're seeing a lot of big box retailers as well as these mega corporations are really cutting back.
[00:18:03.351 --> 00:18:09.155]  And again, that points to the concerns that a lot of people have about the state of the economy.
[00:18:09.155 --> 00:18:23.064]  Even though we hear all of this rosy news out of the Obama administration, even though the stock market is in a massive bubble, we see that Amazon.com lost, and I don't have the article here, I think it was something like $57 million in the first quarter.
[00:18:23.724 --> 00:18:28.706]  We see that Target closed 300 some odd stores in Canada.
[00:18:28.706 --> 00:18:36.590]  And of course the bankers are talking about how they can try to stimulate the dead economy by going to negative interest rates.
[00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.831]  In other words, incentivizing you to go ahead and spend your money.
[00:18:38.831 --> 00:18:39.751]  Don't save anything.
[00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:44.193]  It's not enough of a disincentive to not pay you anything for the money that's in the bank.
[00:18:44.193 --> 00:18:47.435]  So now they're going to actually punish you for saving.
[00:18:47.435 --> 00:18:48.935]  Heavily punish you.
[00:18:48.935 --> 00:18:52.837]  And as a part of that, we talked about that with Paul Joseph Watson earlier this week,
[00:18:54.198 --> 00:19:02.860]  Instituting techniques to abolish the use of cash and of course the government is heavily into that.
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:12.622]  Now we're going to talk about the Southern Poverty Law Center story and the hit piece they did on the Oath Keepers out in Oregon when Paul Joseph Watson joins us.
[00:19:12.622 --> 00:19:21.904]  I want to play a clip of what one of the people there at the Sugar Pine Mine said what the real question is when he was talking to the Oath Keepers.
[00:19:21.904 --> 00:19:22.644]  Let's play that clip.
[00:19:23.314 --> 00:19:33.896]  Well, recently there's been some discussion in the media as to whether we were right or wrong to bring in the Oath Keepers to help protect our constitutional rights and our right to due process.
[00:19:33.896 --> 00:19:36.637]  The real question here isn't whether we were right or wrong.
[00:19:36.637 --> 00:19:46.639]  The real question that needs to be asked and discussed is why we have to seek outside help to preserve our own rights in our own country from our own government.
[00:19:46.639 --> 00:19:47.919]  That's the question.
[00:19:47.919 --> 00:19:48.579]  That's the question.
[00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:51.901]  And I can tell you what the answer to that is.
[00:19:51.901 --> 00:19:59.207]  The answer is that our Congress, long ago, long before these trade agreements, they delegated, they abdicated their authority to these bureaucracies.
[00:19:59.207 --> 00:20:01.909]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:06.232]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.

[00:24:02.232 --> 00:24:05.013]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:10.146 --> 00:24:11.547]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:11.547 --> 00:24:13.188]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:24:13.188 --> 00:24:21.512]  We're going to play a documentary film from No More News, and that is K-N-O-W.
[00:24:21.512 --> 00:24:25.895]  No More News, exposing mainstream media's propaganda campaign to ridicule Alex Jones.
[00:24:25.895 --> 00:24:29.136]  We're going to play a little bit of that for you in the next segment.
[00:24:29.136 --> 00:24:36.561]  Before we get back to the news, I just wanted to remind you that we have a sale going on on Silver Bullet at the InfoWars store.
[00:24:37.501 --> 00:24:40.402]  That is 50% off the usual price.
[00:24:40.402 --> 00:24:43.183]  It's now, that's $15 savings per bottle.
[00:24:43.183 --> 00:24:46.025]  It's 30 parts per million colloidal silver.
[00:24:46.025 --> 00:24:47.885]  A very strong concentration of colloidal silver.
[00:24:47.885 --> 00:24:52.027]  And again, that is available at the biggest discount we've ever had at InfoWars.
[00:24:52.027 --> 00:24:52.867]  It's $15 off per bottle.
[00:24:52.867 --> 00:24:54.208]  That's 50% off per bottle right now.
[00:24:57.796 --> 00:25:14.732]  Well, going back to the news, as I pointed out, in the next hour, Paul Joseph Watson is going to be talking to us about the SPLC, as well as his story about PayPal now changing the user agreement, saying that they are asserting ownership, copyright ownership, over all intellectual property of its users.
[00:25:14.732 --> 00:25:15.813]  We're going to break that down.
[00:25:17.022 --> 00:25:24.689]  But we were talking in the last segment about this story, about the SPLC coming after the Oath Keepers, coming after the miners there.
[00:25:24.689 --> 00:25:32.897]  You heard that clip just before we went to break, as to the question is, why would we need to be protected by Oath Keepers against our government?
[00:25:32.897 --> 00:25:35.880]  And of course, the answer is, is that just as our
[00:25:37.034 --> 00:25:53.910]  Congress has abdicated its authority on these trade agreements, turning it over to corporate lawyers in the same way they long ago turned over their legislative responsibility, abdicated that to these bureaucracies that they've created, allowing these bureaucrats
[00:25:54.591 --> 00:25:57.233]  To write the laws for Americans.
[00:25:57.233 --> 00:25:58.874]  Unelected, perpetual bureaucrats.
[00:25:58.874 --> 00:26:03.637]  That's one of the reasons why things don't change, regardless of whether we got Republicans or Democrats in power.
[00:26:03.637 --> 00:26:16.986]  It's because of these massive armies of bureaucracies creating their little empires, where they write the law, they have their own enforcement mechanism, and they also have their own little courts, their own kangaroo courts.
[00:26:16.986 --> 00:26:21.909]  And that's why you need to have people to your neighbors to protect you.
[00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:23.911]  There's a lot of different ways that we can protect each other too.
[00:26:25.012 --> 00:26:35.688]  We can start to get an awareness that we all have due process rights and what those rights are and the purpose and the responsibility and duty of juries.
[00:26:35.688 --> 00:26:40.175]  That was ultimately the major check I believe that we had against
[00:26:40.475 --> 00:26:40.836]  Thank you.
[00:26:56.914 --> 00:26:58.875]  And to basically protect each other.
[00:26:58.875 --> 00:27:03.538]  Now I want to go back to this situation in Oregon.
[00:27:03.538 --> 00:27:08.921]  There's a poem, Our Government Land, and this is also from the Oath Keepers video.
[00:27:08.921 --> 00:27:11.183]  I want to play a little bit of that for you, just a few seconds of that.
[00:27:11.183 --> 00:27:12.444]  Let's go ahead and play that.
[00:27:12.444 --> 00:27:16.646]  My name is Steve Beck and I'd just like to contribute a poem to this.
[00:27:18.307 --> 00:27:21.230]  It's called on government land.
[00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:24.413]  The government is taking away everything, only to make it their own.
[00:27:24.413 --> 00:27:28.437]  You can't even hold conversations on your own private telephone.
[00:27:28.437 --> 00:27:32.420]  They own the water, they own the air, they own everything, and they own everywhere.
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:37.605]  If they can't own it, they just steal it away, turn it into a park, and then they can say they own it.
[00:27:37.605 --> 00:27:41.869]  They own it with taxes, they own it with fees, no matter the cost, they do as they please.
[00:27:41.869 --> 00:27:43.010]  They think they own us.
[00:27:44.891 --> 00:27:46.292]  They treat us like cattle.
[00:27:46.292 --> 00:27:48.634]  They herd us like cattle and treat us like sheep.
[00:27:48.634 --> 00:27:51.175]  After the shearing, our fleece is to keep.
[00:27:51.175 --> 00:27:55.718]  Sooner or later, if we don't take a stand, we all shall be living on government land.
[00:28:00.077 --> 00:28:00.677]  Absolutely.
[00:28:00.677 --> 00:28:03.099]  They think that they own everything.
[00:28:03.099 --> 00:28:04.420]  They assert that they own everything.
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:12.586]  And there's really an element of corporate fascism involved in this because it is a partnership between government and big business.
[00:28:12.586 --> 00:28:25.595]  That's what we're going to see and increasingly seeing with these efforts by Monsanto to keep us from knowing what's in our food, to block any efforts to inform consumers, to allow them to have a choice, and of course with the vaccines.
[00:28:26.235 --> 00:28:30.096]  Saying, you're not going to be informed, and we don't care whether or not you've got consent.
[00:28:30.096 --> 00:28:32.997]  Just shut up and take the shot.
[00:28:32.997 --> 00:28:37.759]  As I mentioned in the very first segment, there was a story up on LewRockwell.com.
[00:28:37.759 --> 00:28:42.800]  A person who wrote this said earlier in the year they went to a medical center, there was an outbreak of a superbug there.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.621]  Seven people got infected, two people died.
[00:28:45.621 --> 00:28:47.262]  They were there with their daughter.
[00:28:47.262 --> 00:28:50.243]  They thought there would be some reporting of it, but no, they didn't hear anything about that.
[00:28:51.124 --> 00:28:57.827]  All you heard about was the measles outbreak, where nobody died, using that to push for mandatory vaccines.
[00:28:57.827 --> 00:29:04.729]  And so this author says, well, you know, I tried to imagine what their playbook looks like and came up with several points.
[00:29:04.729 --> 00:29:06.490]  I just wanted to throw these headlines out to you.
[00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:17.193]  Number one, make it clear that parents who choose not to vaccinate their children are only getting their information from Jenny McCarthy, Jim Carrey, and other celebrities with absolutely no scientific credentials.
[00:29:17.193 --> 00:29:24.115]  And also, number two, equate the views of the CDC, the medical journals, and pharmaceutical company spokespersons with science.
[00:29:24.855 --> 00:29:29.096]  Some people will tell you science is a method, it's not a conclusion, but don't listen to them.
[00:29:29.096 --> 00:29:29.736]  And you know what?
[00:29:29.736 --> 00:29:36.578]  If all of that doesn't work, just hold a gun to their heads, say shut up, and do it because I say so.
[00:29:36.578 --> 00:29:37.878]  I own you.
[00:29:37.878 --> 00:29:43.739]  We're going to talk about what's going on with cars, and we're going to play a little bit of a video of a car show that was here just a week ago.
[00:29:43.739 --> 00:29:45.559]  One of the best car shows in the country.
[00:29:45.559 --> 00:29:47.460]  Stay with us, we're going to show you some clips of that.
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.000]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:52.222]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.222 --> 00:29:59.065]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.065 --> 00:30:02.547]  Joe Banks here with InfoWars.com with a Jade Helm 1-5 update.
[00:30:02.547 --> 00:30:07.129]  This is a psy-op to condition people in the scene military up and down the streets.
[00:30:07.129 --> 00:30:14.993]  Special operations soldiers will be dressed in civilian attire, blending in, doing what they call suspicious activity.
[00:30:15.273 --> 00:30:20.038]  The people of Bastrop County in Texas, right outside of Austin, are not happy about it.
[00:30:20.038 --> 00:30:32.672]  These architects of SOCOM, who do this Jade Helm 1-5 exercise, will be coming to Bastrop to speak on Monday, April 27th at the Commissioner Court Meeting on 804 Pecan Street, second floor.
[00:30:32.672 --> 00:30:34.254]  The meeting starts at 9 a.m.
[00:30:34.254 --> 00:30:35.435]  It is open to the public.
[00:30:35.795 --> 00:30:45.598]  I want to encourage each and every one of you patriots, Americans who actually give a damn about this country to get off your butt, get off your couch, put the keys in the ignition.
[00:30:45.598 --> 00:30:49.459]  This is something that I want to see people show up to in mass numbers.
[00:30:49.459 --> 00:30:55.840]  I'm sick and tired of this stuff and I hope that some of you people out there are sick and tired too and will show up at 9 a.m.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.821]  at the County Commissioner's courtroom in Bastrop.
[00:30:58.821 --> 00:31:02.182]  What lies at the heart of Infowars and everything we do?
[00:31:02.982 --> 00:31:10.787]  But the core is fellow human beings of every race, color, and creed across the United States and the planet that believe in personal liberty.
[00:31:10.787 --> 00:31:14.690]  And it's people like you that have promoted the radio broadcast to their friends and family.
[00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:21.194]  It's people like you that have bought the high-quality products at InfoWarsStore.com that have made everything we do possible.
[00:31:21.194 --> 00:31:23.015]  And that's why I want to salute you.
[00:31:23.015 --> 00:31:25.736]  You have helped us build this operation.
[00:31:25.736 --> 00:31:29.099]  You don't stand beside us or behind us or even in front of us.
[00:31:29.099 --> 00:31:31.200]  You stand at the heart of InfoWars.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:40.548]  That's why in the month of April, we're offering some of the biggest specials yet to introduce listeners to these high-quality nutraceuticals at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:32:28.824 --> 00:32:29.845]  Alex Jones here.
[00:32:29.845 --> 00:32:39.130]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:42.913]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[00:32:53.619 --> 00:32:54.620]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:00.436 --> 00:33:01.777]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:33:01.777 --> 00:33:02.697]  Mao took the guns.
[00:33:02.697 --> 00:33:04.177]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[00:33:04.177 --> 00:33:05.718]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[00:33:05.718 --> 00:33:11.080]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:15.682]  It doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken.
[00:33:15.682 --> 00:33:17.203]  We will not relinquish them.
[00:33:17.203 --> 00:33:18.083]  Do you understand?
[00:33:18.083 --> 00:33:24.325]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:33:24.325 --> 00:33:25.806]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.156 --> 00:33:33.498]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:33.498 --> 00:33:35.621]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[00:33:35.621 --> 00:33:38.564]  We have an article that's up on InfoWars this Friday.
[00:33:38.564 --> 00:33:41.809]  Alex Jones versus the mainstream media.
[00:33:41.809 --> 00:33:45.313]  Embedded in that is a documentary film from No More News.
[00:33:45.313 --> 00:33:47.015]  And that's K-N-O-W.
[00:33:47.015 --> 00:33:47.977]  No More News.
[00:33:48.457 --> 00:33:51.621]  Exposing the mainstream media's propaganda campaign to Ridicule Jones.
[00:33:51.621 --> 00:33:53.663]  I want to play a little bit of this documentary.
[00:33:53.663 --> 00:33:57.447]  We're not going to play, of course, the entire documentary because it's quite long.
[00:33:57.447 --> 00:34:02.953]  But I want you to get a sample of what this looks like and you can see the entire video at Infowarriors.com.
[00:34:02.953 --> 00:34:03.614]  Let's roll that now.
[00:34:10.054 --> 00:34:11.896]  First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight with you.
[00:34:11.896 --> 00:34:13.036]  He's not really representing this guy's name.
[00:34:13.036 --> 00:34:15.058]  I mean, he does not represent America.
[00:34:15.058 --> 00:34:17.300]  This is the same guy that said that the U.S.
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:20.302]  government is involved in Oklahoma bombings and 9-11.
[00:34:20.302 --> 00:34:22.504]  So it's just he really lives in the land of wacky.
[00:34:22.504 --> 00:34:23.605]  Some guy on the radio.
[00:34:23.605 --> 00:34:24.766]  We don't really know who he is.
[00:34:24.766 --> 00:34:26.367]  I don't know because I don't pay attention to him.
[00:34:26.947 --> 00:34:28.147]  Uh, and what's his face?
[00:34:28.147 --> 00:34:29.448]  Well, whoever that guy was.
[00:34:29.448 --> 00:34:33.669]  A guy that we don't talk about very often because he's so insignificant and we don't really care.
[00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:35.789]  But he is, he is a... He's also psycho.
[00:34:35.789 --> 00:34:38.010]  Yeah, he's... Can we just say what it is?
[00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:39.890]  He's a really spooky guy.
[00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:43.411]  Um, and you just have to be careful of it, and as long as you know who he is, it's fine.
[00:34:43.411 --> 00:34:48.452]  They've tried to ignore us, uh, in past decades, and now they can't.
[00:34:55.197 --> 00:34:57.438]  The talk show host is Alex Jones.
[00:34:57.438 --> 00:34:59.138]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[00:34:59.138 --> 00:35:03.560]  He's kind of like the guru, the king of the conspiracy theorists.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.681]  He's considered legit among the crazies.
[00:35:05.681 --> 00:35:07.641]  The king of conspiracy.
[00:35:07.641 --> 00:35:09.742]  Radio show host Alex Jones.
[00:35:09.742 --> 00:35:12.703]  Alex Jones, king of the conspiracy theorists.
[00:35:13.303 --> 00:35:15.004]  I'm not the king of conspiracy!
[00:35:15.004 --> 00:35:16.465]  I'm the king of reality!
[00:35:16.465 --> 00:35:19.147]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:35:19.147 --> 00:35:21.109]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:24.291]  Conspiracy theorist and conservative radio host like Alex Jones.
[00:35:24.291 --> 00:35:27.653]  They just marginalize him by calling him a conspiracy theorist.
[00:35:27.653 --> 00:35:30.155]  Quasi-journalist such as Alex Jones.
[00:35:30.155 --> 00:35:32.697]  The outrageous Alex Jones.
[00:35:32.697 --> 00:35:33.478]  Most dishonest.
[00:35:34.678 --> 00:35:37.501]  You know, journalists of our age.
[00:35:37.501 --> 00:35:43.085]  Jones is arguably the nation's premier purveyor of what could be called paranoia porn.
[00:35:43.085 --> 00:35:45.567]  He's not a conservative.
[00:35:45.567 --> 00:35:48.449]  He's not a conservative.
[00:35:48.449 --> 00:35:52.152]  I don't know what he is except a conspiracy theorist.
[00:35:54.153 --> 00:35:57.616]  Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[00:35:57.616 --> 00:36:01.258]  An absolute, die-hard, insane lunatic.
[00:36:01.258 --> 00:36:11.125]  Alex Jones has forwarded some of the most outrageous, ridiculous conspiracy theories about how the world works.
[00:36:11.125 --> 00:36:17.390]  He is pushing outright lies and propaganda on a regular basis, and I think it ultimately subverts
[00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:26.515]  The important real journalism that independent journalists are doing on a regular basis by giving the impression that everyone's running around wearing a tinfoil hat.
[00:36:26.515 --> 00:36:30.657]  Now here comes the lunatic conspiracy theory of the night.
[00:36:30.657 --> 00:36:33.279]  You want to call me a conspiracy theory for saying that?
[00:36:33.279 --> 00:36:35.040]  I can read the legislation.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:39.002]  His new conspiracy theory could be his most ridiculous yet.
[00:36:39.002 --> 00:36:45.406]  You could have gone to the document instead of sitting there saying I was a conspiracy theorist.
[00:36:45.726 --> 00:36:47.807]  Look, the guy's mentally disturbed.
[00:36:47.807 --> 00:36:48.608]  Wow!
[00:36:48.608 --> 00:36:50.469]  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do!
[00:36:50.469 --> 00:36:51.830]  Little Twilight Zone there.
[00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:53.951]  The media will handle him.
[00:36:53.951 --> 00:36:56.152]  The disinformation campaign will go out.
[00:36:56.152 --> 00:37:10.161]  They're gonna try to label this very sane, very reasoned, very learned, very skilled man as a crazy loon, as an off-the-charts madman.
[00:37:10.161 --> 00:37:11.201]  This guy's beautiful mind.
[00:37:11.201 --> 00:37:13.483]  He goes into his room and starts drawing things on a chalkboard.
[00:37:13.923 --> 00:37:17.487]  Right, like, oh, and then 2 squared is 4, but then 4 squared is like 28!
[00:37:17.487 --> 00:37:20.271]  Oh my god, oh my god!
[00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:22.033]  Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, right?
[00:37:22.033 --> 00:37:27.880]  I think he is psycho, because he's drawing up things, and the square root of 28 is this!
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.042]  The guy's lost his freaking mind!
[00:37:36.634 --> 00:37:39.275]  He can see a lot of things that other people can't see.
[00:37:39.275 --> 00:37:43.597]  Like a conspiracy around every corner and in everyone's eyes.
[00:37:43.597 --> 00:37:50.320]  It's in a CIA memo from 1963 that you say, conspiracy theory, tinfoil hat.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.720]  I mean, that's declassified.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:55.702]  The CIA, right after they killed Kennedy, put out these talking points.
[00:37:56.022 --> 00:38:00.024]  If you talk to Alex for any length of time, you discover all kinds of things that you didn't know about the world.
[00:38:00.024 --> 00:38:01.104]  We've blown it wide open.
[00:38:01.104 --> 00:38:01.784]  You have.
[00:38:01.784 --> 00:38:03.405]  You have absolutely blown it wide open.
[00:38:03.405 --> 00:38:09.947]  This guy's agenda is that the United States government blew up the World Trade Center.
[00:38:09.947 --> 00:38:14.069]  So when you start with that premise, you're in a whole different category.
[00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:16.550]  Yeah, and remember, put yourself back a few years.
[00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:21.071]  I know we have short memories, but this is the guy who is convincing 50% of Democrats
[00:38:23.152 --> 00:38:26.354]  That George W. Bush was responsible for bringing down the World Trade Center.
[00:38:26.354 --> 00:38:28.195]  He was that close with them.
[00:38:28.195 --> 00:38:32.798]  You're trying to create a partisan wedge to keep people on the partisan left-right paradigm.
[00:38:32.798 --> 00:38:35.500]  Look man, I'm way past this junior high control.
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.241]  I got that, I got that.
[00:38:36.241 --> 00:38:41.684]  He thinks that George Walker Bush, the President of the United States, ordered the destruction of 9-11.
[00:38:41.684 --> 00:38:46.747]  He's the guy that, with some sort of pumping action, blew up the World Trade Centers and the Pentagon.
[00:38:46.747 --> 00:38:47.548]  He did it!
[00:38:47.548 --> 00:38:49.229]  That's what this nutcase believes.
[00:38:49.229 --> 00:38:52.471]  He was essentially comparing President Bush to Adolf Hitler.
[00:38:52.891 --> 00:39:00.372]  I was the first to expose 9-11 on the day, in fact, two months before I had intel that elements of the military-industrial complex were going to carry out the attack.
[00:39:00.372 --> 00:39:05.673]  I said they'll use Bin Laden, the known CIA asset, as their patsy to take the blame for attacking the towers.
[00:39:05.673 --> 00:39:08.014]  If any terrorism comes, it's from this government.
[00:39:08.014 --> 00:39:18.696]  And if there was an outside threat like a Bin Laden, who was a known CIA asset in the 80s, running the Mujahideen war, and whose family builds all the military bases over in Saudi Arabia right now, he's the boogeyman they need.
[00:39:20.857 --> 00:39:25.720]  And now we have come to a decision that maybe the United States is looking for a boogeyman always.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.943]  That conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories.
[00:39:28.943 --> 00:39:31.744]  It's an internet talk show called InfoWars.
[00:39:31.744 --> 00:39:34.206]  These political fringe sites, they have facts.
[00:39:34.266 --> 00:39:43.250]  They have figures, they quote people, yet they're treated by much of the media as if they're somehow credible, that a quote from one of those sites is no different than something from the New York Times.
[00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:51.794]  We've got to have the media call anyone that questions us conspiracy theorists, and any media that's not the Washington Post or New York Times is a conspiracy theory.
[00:39:51.794 --> 00:39:56.357]  The website InfoWars, a paranoid online haven run by Alex Jones.
[00:39:56.357 --> 00:39:59.038]  He's on the internet and he's got a lot of followers, he's got a big website.
[00:39:59.218 --> 00:40:02.820]  He usually preaches to his own little paranoid choir.
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:09.243]  I think that this internet stuff, with this access now that people have, has made more crazy people.
[00:40:09.243 --> 00:40:16.746]  Really smart people have come up to me and said, you know, I just saw this on something from InfoWars, do you know anything about it?
[00:40:16.746 --> 00:40:18.407]  And I'm like, yeah, stay away from it!
[00:40:18.647 --> 00:40:21.968]  You have to be careful of who you get your news from.
[00:40:21.968 --> 00:40:25.649]  Well, I got it from InfoWars, and I'm like, okay, no.
[00:40:25.649 --> 00:40:29.750]  Then I can tell you right now, it's most likely not true.
[00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:31.911]  You can't trust a word the guy says.
[00:40:31.911 --> 00:40:32.491]  Yeah, the word.
[00:40:32.491 --> 00:40:37.072]  The system is extremely threatened by us telling the truth.
[00:40:37.072 --> 00:40:46.855]  They're extremely threatened by the fact that they've been caught lying and engaging in so much oppression and so much corruption for so long that they're really floundering around.
[00:40:47.295 --> 00:41:02.522]  The important thing about what Alex Jones is about, what he represents, is that he has pushed out completely baseless conspiracy theories to literally tens of millions of Americans out there, many of whom actually believe what he says.
[00:41:02.522 --> 00:41:07.284]  What really would concern me about somebody like him is the amount of influence.
[00:41:07.284 --> 00:41:08.605]  He has a growing influence.
[00:41:08.605 --> 00:41:11.426]  As he boasted, he's got millions of people listening to him.
[00:41:11.426 --> 00:41:15.368]  Some of his YouTube rants have got tens of millions of people watching them.
[00:41:16.028 --> 00:41:20.110]  And he ferments this fear of a tyrannical regime.
[00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:36.357]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist, whose stories often make their way from his website, InfoWars, where on any day you can find headlines about vaccines, mass fluoridation, and the 9-11 cover-up, into the so-called mainstream GOP establishment.
[00:41:36.357 --> 00:41:40.599]  In every tragedy, the InfoWars Alex Jones world thinks they see a conspiracy.
[00:41:41.099 --> 00:41:47.441]  Every time there is a mass shooting or a terrorist attack, Jones is quick to blame them on the government or global forces.
[00:41:47.441 --> 00:41:55.304]  From September the 11th to the Boston Marathon bombings, Jones calls acts of violence false flag operations.
[00:41:55.304 --> 00:41:58.705]  And he's been on the air since day one saying this is the job of the FBI.
[00:41:58.705 --> 00:42:00.266]  It's a false flag job.
[00:42:00.266 --> 00:42:05.628]  You heard the reporter question us whether it was false flag job, meaning, you know, is this just, you know, they're twisting it around to make it
[00:42:05.888 --> 00:42:23.477]  We know the Gulf of Tonkin was staged, so we know that governments allow attacks to happen, we know that governments sometimes actually stage attacks.
[00:42:23.477 --> 00:42:25.578]  So in a lot of cases, they open the door.
[00:42:25.578 --> 00:42:27.159]  That's what 9-11 Truth is saying.
[00:42:27.159 --> 00:42:29.860]  You're making some very serious allegations against the U.S.
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:34.663]  government, saying that they stage attacks, they allow them to occur in the United States against U.S.
[00:42:34.663 --> 00:42:34.923]  citizens.
[00:42:35.803 --> 00:42:36.684]  What?
[00:42:36.684 --> 00:42:39.005]  No, what evidence do you have to support any of that?
[00:42:39.005 --> 00:42:43.627]  Well, the Gulf of Tonkin is very, very well documented, but... Hey, what are you talking about?
[00:42:43.627 --> 00:42:44.327]  Hold on!
[00:42:44.327 --> 00:42:48.369]  It's in Army Field Manuals to stage false flag attacks, declassified 2004.
[00:42:48.369 --> 00:42:56.914]  How dare us say government might ever let terrorists attack us, or might provocateur them, even though it's in the New York Times and Associated Press and well known.
[00:42:56.914 --> 00:42:58.995]  I mean, how dare us?
[00:43:00.075 --> 00:43:05.059]  How dare you say I had sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky?
[00:43:05.059 --> 00:43:06.219]  How dare you?
[00:43:06.219 --> 00:43:07.080]  How dare you?
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.721]  You're like, what are you, like Saddam?
[00:43:08.721 --> 00:43:10.342]  No, I don't like fake wars.
[00:43:10.342 --> 00:43:12.984]  Blaming a country for 9-11 that wasn't involved.
[00:43:12.984 --> 00:43:21.010]  Yes, this is the same guy who has been selling the idea that the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School and the massacre at Aurora, Colorado were actually fake.
[00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:28.395]  They were faked as an excuse to take away our guns and enslave us to the giant wasps who hive beneath the UN building or whatever.
[00:43:28.715 --> 00:43:31.360]  It's the same guy who says the Boston bombing was also fake.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.184]  It was faked for political purposes.
[00:43:33.184 --> 00:43:36.791]  The same guy who says he doesn't believe the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster actually happened.
[00:43:36.791 --> 00:43:39.257]  He doesn't believe there was actually an Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:43:45.916 --> 00:43:50.400]  If you like InfoWars, which is a show hosted by a man named Alex Jones.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:54.743]  If you like Glenn Beck and you like Alex Jones, who says we faked the moon landing.
[00:43:54.743 --> 00:43:58.026]  Okay, so that's a sample of that documentary.
[00:43:58.026 --> 00:44:01.548]  You can see the entire documentary again at InfoWars.com.
[00:44:01.548 --> 00:44:04.571]  Alex Jones versus the mainstream media.
[00:44:04.571 --> 00:44:05.351]  You know, when I look at that...
[00:44:06.372 --> 00:44:09.736]  I have to ask, why are they protesting too much?
[00:44:09.736 --> 00:44:12.158]  We think they protest too much.
[00:44:12.158 --> 00:44:18.304]  It's really a shoot-the-messenger ad hominem attack, just repeating over and over again, conspiracy theorists, conspiracy theorists.
[00:44:18.304 --> 00:44:25.692]  But when you look at this documentary, you realize just how broad and continuous this attack has been from various people.
[00:44:25.692 --> 00:44:27.334]  Like Piers Morgan says, what concerns him?
[00:44:28.334 --> 00:44:37.363]  Is the growing influence of Infowars, and I guess maybe it concerns Piers Morgan of his shrinking influence, which basically disappeared.
[00:44:37.363 --> 00:44:41.187]  And he disappeared and slinked back to the British Isles, where he came from.
[00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:48.956]  Now, in another vein, last week there was a car show here in the Austin area, the Lone Star Car Show.
[00:44:48.956 --> 00:44:54.001]  Of course, this is one of the biggest, best, modified classic car shows.
[00:44:54.001 --> 00:45:04.950]  I wanted to talk to the people there and see if they are really aware of how transportation, especially the freedom that we've had with the automobile, were they aware?
[00:45:05.811 --> 00:45:07.712]  of how it was going to be changing.
[00:45:07.712 --> 00:45:09.973]  Were they aware of how quickly it was going to be coming?
[00:45:09.973 --> 00:45:13.816]  And of course, this can all be dismissed as tinfoil hat conspiracy.
[00:45:13.816 --> 00:45:17.158]  Because there's not anybody really trying to take away your car.
[00:45:17.158 --> 00:45:24.242]  Not anybody trying to control your movements, turn you into a slave that they tax and track everywhere.
[00:45:24.242 --> 00:45:26.203]  That's what these black boxes are about.
[00:45:26.203 --> 00:45:27.684]  We've got a video up on
[00:45:28.684 --> 00:45:32.752]  The Alex Jones YouTube channel, Black Box Vanishing Point of Freedom.
[00:45:32.752 --> 00:45:36.418]  You need to understand that they put black boxes in all the new cars.
[00:45:36.418 --> 00:45:39.724]  Beginning last fall, it's now required in every car manufacturer.
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:41.981]  It is going to track you.
[00:45:41.981 --> 00:45:45.103]  It is going to be used to tax you.
[00:45:45.103 --> 00:45:47.504]  It's going to control your movement.
[00:45:47.504 --> 00:45:51.166]  And it's only going to get worse, and this is coming very, very rapidly.
[00:45:51.166 --> 00:45:58.631]  I wanted to get a pulse of the people because, you know, so many times we're all living our lives, especially productive people like these guys I talked to.
[00:45:58.631 --> 00:46:03.054]  They're people who grew up as gearheads, working on their cars.
[00:46:03.054 --> 00:46:05.115]  Maybe they don't understand where this is coming from.
[00:46:05.115 --> 00:46:07.456]  So let's take a look at this report.
[00:46:07.456 --> 00:46:08.617]  Black Box, Vanishing Point.
[00:46:15.583 --> 00:46:18.504]  We're here at the Lone Star Roundup in Austin, Texas.
[00:46:18.504 --> 00:46:20.405]  This is their 14th year here.
[00:46:20.405 --> 00:46:24.266]  It's one of the biggest and best classic car shows in the country.
[00:46:24.266 --> 00:46:27.047]  All the cars here are 1963 or older.
[00:46:27.047 --> 00:46:29.268]  That means that they're at least 52 years old.
[00:46:29.268 --> 00:46:36.850]  You're going to see a lot of different changes here, but it's also a reflection of America's love of the car, the car culture, and what it brings to us.
[00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:38.471]  Independence and freedom.
[00:46:38.471 --> 00:46:45.013]  So we're going to talk to some of the people here and see what they think about the near future, where drivers are banned from the highway.
[00:46:45.453 --> 00:46:49.739]  Driving a car, there's something about driving a classic car with the windows down.
[00:46:49.739 --> 00:46:51.782]  Don't even have to have the radio on.
[00:46:51.782 --> 00:46:53.284]  You can hear the motor.
[00:46:53.284 --> 00:46:54.526]  You can't beat it.
[00:46:54.526 --> 00:46:55.727]  I'd get rid of them.
[00:46:55.727 --> 00:46:58.271]  My wife, almost, before I'd get rid of some of my cars.
[00:46:59.589 --> 00:47:04.494]  It's an original 1964 Don, uh, Woody Gilmore car out of California.
[00:47:04.494 --> 00:47:11.921]  From this little on, I've been, you know, taking motors apart, taking Volkswagen apart when I was like eight years old, you know.
[00:47:11.921 --> 00:47:14.644]  So, it, you know, it's just almost a lifestyle.
[00:47:14.644 --> 00:47:16.706]  You just, I wouldn't know what to do without cars.
[00:47:16.706 --> 00:47:17.106]  I've been
[00:47:18.387 --> 00:47:21.069]  Messed with him ever since I was 14 years old.
[00:47:21.069 --> 00:47:24.411]  The only thing that's not original is the motor and the body.
[00:47:24.411 --> 00:47:28.694]  But it is an original 1963 Top Fuel car.
[00:47:28.694 --> 00:47:29.815]  That's a beautiful car.
[00:47:29.815 --> 00:47:31.516]  Well, it's Tweety Bird.
[00:47:31.516 --> 00:47:32.336]  It was gone for 50 years.
[00:47:33.537 --> 00:47:38.021]  And he sold it to pay for his first child being born in 1962.
[00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:45.327]  And we were at a swap meet, and a guy answered his cell phone and says, we need to move the Model A out of the garage in Tweedy.
[00:47:45.327 --> 00:47:46.187]  And I go, oh my gosh.
[00:47:46.187 --> 00:47:50.250]  So I tapped him on the shoulder and I said, Tweedy doesn't have to be a yellow 32, does it?
[00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:51.471]  And he goes, yes.
[00:47:51.471 --> 00:47:53.513]  The guy says, I own your car.
[00:47:53.513 --> 00:47:54.213]  You ever seen this?
[00:47:54.213 --> 00:47:55.815]  Google self-driving car?
[00:47:55.815 --> 00:47:55.975]  Yeah.
[00:47:56.255 --> 00:47:57.717]  No steering wheel, no brakes.
[00:47:57.717 --> 00:47:59.098]  Would you want to ride in that car?
[00:47:59.098 --> 00:47:59.539]  No.
[00:47:59.539 --> 00:48:02.102]  I've got to have some control over what I'm in.
[00:48:02.102 --> 00:48:02.642]  Google?
[00:48:02.642 --> 00:48:04.805]  Google self-driving car?
[00:48:04.805 --> 00:48:06.467]  No steering wheel, no brakes.
[00:48:06.467 --> 00:48:07.388]  That's scary.
[00:48:07.388 --> 00:48:14.897]  I spent 33 years in the United States Air Force, so you know, I'm familiar with all navigation systems.
[00:48:14.897 --> 00:48:16.659]  I've been in places with GBS that
[00:48:17.577 --> 00:48:19.078]  Took me in the wrong direction.
[00:48:19.078 --> 00:48:22.380]  How's that computer gonna react when a deer jumps out in front of you?
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:25.663]  Or something falls out of the sky and you can see it coming down?
[00:48:25.663 --> 00:48:27.064]  Maybe it's out of its range.
[00:48:27.064 --> 00:48:30.626]  Have you seen the Google car that has no steering wheel and no brakes?
[00:48:30.626 --> 00:48:33.128]  Yeah, I looked this up last week actually.
[00:48:33.128 --> 00:48:34.729]  How would you feel to get in a car like that?
[00:48:35.812 --> 00:48:39.894]  Uh, I don't know, I guess I wouldn't really, uh, I wouldn't feel comfortable at all.
[00:48:39.894 --> 00:48:42.995]  Uh, what do you think about, uh, autonomous driving cars?
[00:48:42.995 --> 00:48:46.397]  You know, cars where you don't have a steering wheel or brakes.
[00:48:46.397 --> 00:48:49.318]  They're talking about, uh, using that extensively.
[00:48:49.318 --> 00:48:54.360]  I think I may see it when I'm an old man, maybe, but... I still think humans are gonna be driving them.
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:58.922]  Humans are gonna be in control of them for, I know, the rest of my life.
[00:48:58.922 --> 00:49:03.284]  Do you think that they will be in, uh, driving, initially on, uh, eventually on the road?
[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:10.723]  I wouldn't be surprised eventually, but I don't see it anytime soon in our lifetime, or at least not as long as I'm driving.
[00:49:10.723 --> 00:49:17.146]  Hopefully it's after my lifetime or our lifetime, but my personal opinion, I don't see it happening intentionally.
[00:49:17.146 --> 00:49:21.788]  Ford, I think, has just put out a thing that will keep you from speeding.
[00:49:21.788 --> 00:49:25.730]  So it'll basically break your car if you go above the speed limit, it'll slow you down.
[00:49:27.873 --> 00:49:29.875]  I don't like it, but I don't drive Fords either, so.
[00:49:29.875 --> 00:49:35.982]  Autonomous driving cars with the government tracking every mile that we drive and taxing us on every mile that we drive.
[00:49:35.982 --> 00:49:37.204]  How do you feel about that?
[00:49:37.204 --> 00:49:38.725]  I do not like it.
[00:49:38.725 --> 00:49:41.769]  Okay, they're charging everywhere it's turning into a toll road, right?
[00:49:41.769 --> 00:49:43.291]  And they got the easy tag.
[00:49:43.291 --> 00:49:45.834]  How long is it going to be before they go, okay, you went through
[00:49:46.694 --> 00:49:51.958]  Toll number 3 at this time and you went through toll number 4 at this time.
[00:49:51.958 --> 00:49:56.200]  Well you went 90 miles an hour from here to there and they're going to send you a ticket in the mail.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:02.544]  They're putting black boxes in all of the new cars, probably retrofitted back to any of the cars that are on the street.
[00:50:02.544 --> 00:50:05.686]  That's going to measure how fast you accelerate, how fast you corner.
[00:50:05.686 --> 00:50:08.248]  They're going to give that information to the insurance companies.
[00:50:08.248 --> 00:50:09.189]  What do you think about that?
[00:50:09.189 --> 00:50:09.729]  And the government.
[00:50:10.698 --> 00:50:12.919]  Uh, I don't like that.
[00:50:12.919 --> 00:50:14.480]  I'm glad I don't have one on my car.
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.701]  The human factor needs to be there.
[00:50:16.701 --> 00:50:18.602]  You can't have everything computerized.
[00:50:18.602 --> 00:50:26.247]  The CEO of Uber has said that once they get self-driving cars, once they get autonomous driving cars, car ownership will go away.
[00:50:26.247 --> 00:50:26.867]  That's their goal.
[00:50:26.867 --> 00:50:28.588]  What do you think about that?
[00:50:28.588 --> 00:50:30.789]  They're gonna have a hard time with that, I think.
[00:50:30.789 --> 00:50:39.374]  I mean, people, I think a lot of people are getting fed up with the infringement on our freedoms, with the spying and all this kind of stuff, you know?
[00:50:39.374 --> 00:50:39.654]  It's like,
[00:50:40.874 --> 00:50:47.825]  Why are you spying on us, listening to my phone call and all that, and you're going to tell me I can't drive my car and I'm not going to have the freedom to go where I want to go?
[00:50:47.825 --> 00:50:48.426]  Absolutely right.
[00:50:48.426 --> 00:50:49.067]  No way.
[00:50:49.067 --> 00:50:53.515]  You can see the rest of that report on Infowars.com and the Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[00:50:54.494 --> 00:51:00.060]  It's amazing to see how quickly things are changing, and even the young people didn't think it was going to happen in their lifetime.
[00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:03.424]  Our industry freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[00:51:03.424 --> 00:51:06.607]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[00:51:06.607 --> 00:51:08.249]  Does that sound right to you?

[00:52:59.136 --> 00:53:02.959]  Last year, in the Nevada desert, one family took a stand for freedom.
[00:53:02.959 --> 00:53:07.462]  Numana Food Storage was the first and only company to support the rights of the Bundys.
[00:53:07.462 --> 00:53:13.906]  While others stood down, Numana took donations and provided storable foods to the men at Bunkerville.
[00:53:13.906 --> 00:53:20.891]  Founded by patriots who believe in liberty, Numana Food Storage is GMO-free, great tasting, and easy to prepare.

[00:53:29.306 --> 00:53:30.526]  Hear that?
[00:53:30.526 --> 00:53:35.908]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:53:35.908 --> 00:53:38.848]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:53:38.848 --> 00:53:42.389]  You can prevent being the next victim of a break-in.
[00:53:42.389 --> 00:53:49.951]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[00:53:54.552 --> 00:53:56.973]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[00:53:56.973 --> 00:53:57.413]  Faketv.com
[00:54:17.144 --> 00:54:29.410]  Ladies and gentlemen, the symbol of the automobile is the symbol of modern 20th century Americana that changed the world.
[00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:33.893]  We were the country of George Washington, Babe Ruth, and the 57 Chevy.
[00:54:33.893 --> 00:54:36.314]  We were exceptional.
[00:54:36.314 --> 00:54:40.376]  And that's why the globalists had to colonize the United States with their spies and agents
[00:54:40.996 --> 00:54:43.017]  To take over the great engine of freedom.
[00:54:43.017 --> 00:54:49.178]  It wasn't perfect, but compared to other nations, it was the capital engine of human freedom.
[00:54:49.178 --> 00:54:50.038]  Exploration.
[00:54:50.038 --> 00:54:51.098]  Invention.
[00:54:51.098 --> 00:55:01.641]  We were taken over, and our great scientific brain trust by a technological elite in control of the military-industrial complex took control.
[00:55:01.641 --> 00:55:02.621]  We should do a special report.
[00:55:02.621 --> 00:55:08.083]  We've played it before, but with Eisenhower's full speech, 21 minutes long, his farewell address in 1961, where he says,
[00:55:10.413 --> 00:55:11.653]  The military-industrial complex.
[00:55:11.653 --> 00:55:26.099]  But two lines before that, he describes that a technological elite is already taking over through the military-industrial complex and directing human development and destiny.
[00:55:26.099 --> 00:55:26.939]  And destiny.
[00:55:26.939 --> 00:55:32.161]  And he was an establishment guy, but the plans brought to him by the eugenicists were so evil.
[00:55:32.867 --> 00:55:34.849]  That he had to speak out against and fire L.L.
[00:55:34.849 --> 00:56:00.730]  Levenson, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and others, who wanted a nuclear war, then to bring in the scientific dictatorship, the global cataclysm, to give the United States the excuse to emerge from underground bunkers for Dr. Strangelove and all that's about, turned into fiction by Stanley Kubrick, to bring about the giant cataclysm, and out of that crisis, American ingenuity would then found this eugenics-based psycho club.
[00:56:02.085 --> 00:56:03.345]  They're coming for your cars.
[00:56:03.345 --> 00:56:04.466]  They're coming for your children.
[00:56:04.466 --> 00:56:05.806]  They're coming for your private property.
[00:56:05.806 --> 00:56:07.306]  They're coming for your guns.
[00:56:07.306 --> 00:56:08.967]  We told everybody.
[00:56:08.967 --> 00:56:14.528]  They're putting tracker boxes and taxation systems in all the cars 10, 15 years ago.
[00:56:14.528 --> 00:56:17.168]  We warned you 16, 17 years ago.
[00:56:17.168 --> 00:56:20.109]  But they phased them in all over.
[00:56:20.109 --> 00:56:20.749]  Ubiquitous.
[00:56:20.749 --> 00:56:25.850]  When they finally pull the trigger on the Cashless Society control grid, it's not going to be incremental anymore.
[00:56:25.850 --> 00:56:27.971]  It's going to be overnight when they
[00:56:29.268 --> 00:56:30.632]  Engage this system.
[00:56:30.632 --> 00:56:32.057]  That's why they're banning cash.
[00:56:32.927 --> 00:56:34.248]  That's why they're restricting it.
[00:56:34.248 --> 00:56:35.969]  That's why JP Morgan's going after it.
[00:56:35.969 --> 00:56:38.029]  That's why Citibank says get rid of it.
[00:56:38.029 --> 00:56:47.294]  Because they want to track and control everything you do, so they can turn off your digital cards and your biometric signature, and you won't be able to buy or sell.
[00:56:47.294 --> 00:56:49.355]  And this is their words, not the Bible.
[00:56:49.355 --> 00:56:52.977]  So, for those of you that hate Christ and hate the Bible, hey, you don't have to deal with that.
[00:56:52.977 --> 00:56:54.777]  Deal with the globalists themselves.
[00:56:54.777 --> 00:56:59.800]  Saying they will track and control every human movement, everything you do, at every level,
[00:57:00.764 --> 00:57:05.385]  Through these systems, as soon as they're in place, and you trust them, and it's all you know.
[00:57:06.252 --> 00:57:15.797]  That's why they're waging war on farmers markets, lemonade stands, small machine shops, the Amish communities, people coming together.
[00:57:15.797 --> 00:57:18.258]  They want you at big box stores.
[00:57:18.258 --> 00:57:33.365]  That's why they're trying to ban, with legislation that we covered yesterday, that David covered, that's why they're trying to ban working on your own car, or going in and removing the kill switches that are in a car that you've already paid for, that you don't owe money on anymore.
[00:57:33.365 --> 00:57:35.226]  All the cars for 12 years in the U.S.
[00:57:36.036 --> 00:57:38.898]  Under federal regulations have kill switches in them.
[00:57:38.898 --> 00:57:42.020]  That's why repossession is not an issue anymore because they just turn your car off.
[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:43.321]  What about once you own it?
[00:57:43.321 --> 00:57:44.902]  Well, you don't really own it.
[00:57:44.902 --> 00:57:46.604]  It's got kill switches in it.
[00:57:46.604 --> 00:57:47.584]  So does the internet.
[00:57:47.584 --> 00:57:48.885]  So does your toaster.
[00:57:48.885 --> 00:57:50.026]  So does your microwave oven.
[00:57:50.026 --> 00:57:51.787]  So does your smart TV.
[00:57:51.787 --> 00:57:52.448]  Everything.
[00:57:52.448 --> 00:57:56.250]  The head of the CIA three years ago said this.
[00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:59.893]  Now, of course, we told you 15 years ago because MIT was reporting.
[00:57:59.893 --> 00:58:02.755]  All they could do is call us tinfoil hats and hope
[00:58:03.524 --> 00:58:05.725]  That you don't investigate this total plan.
[00:58:05.725 --> 00:58:06.866]  We've got to stop it.
[00:58:06.866 --> 00:58:08.427]  We've got to speak out against it.
[00:58:08.427 --> 00:58:27.098]  And regardless, if it is the beast and the end of the world and all the rest of it, it's our job to warn people so their soul, at the end, before they die, converts to reality, admits the great lie, breaks the conditioning, breaks the trance, breaks the delusion, and becomes one with God's consciousness, one with Christ.
[00:58:27.658 --> 00:58:44.042]  The enemy wants to keep you in artificial construct of false reality, keep you in deception until you die, so that you have no knowledge spiritually of the wider universe and God's great plan, so that you're walled off and are a child of the devil on this tiny little planet that he's hijacked.
[00:58:44.042 --> 00:58:46.283]  This is the epic level decision.
[00:58:47.068 --> 00:58:47.709]  You have to make.
[00:58:47.709 --> 00:58:48.509]  We're going to break.
[00:58:48.509 --> 00:58:49.050]  God bless you.
[00:58:49.050 --> 00:58:57.917]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:58:57.917 --> 00:59:06.324]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of Southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:59:06.324 --> 00:59:11.208]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:59:11.208 --> 00:59:14.591]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[00:59:16.072 --> 00:59:16.652]  We're good to go.
[00:59:40.037 --> 00:59:41.718]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:04.932 --> 01:00:06.233]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.233 --> 01:00:08.014]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.014 --> 01:00:09.775]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.775 --> 01:00:11.356]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.356 --> 01:00:12.897]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.897 --> 01:00:17.080]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:21.143]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.063 --> 01:00:24.084]  You want answers?
[01:00:24.084 --> 01:00:25.824]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:25.824 --> 01:00:31.506]  I'm going to finish up here and throw the baton back to David Knight, and then I'll be live in studio this Sunday, Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:00:31.506 --> 01:00:33.866]  Central, and back all next week in studio.
[01:00:33.866 --> 01:00:40.448]  But I tell you, we've built an amazing team of crew and researchers and hosts up there, so I thank God every moment for everybody.
[01:00:40.448 --> 01:00:42.188]  Here is the final equation.
[01:00:42.188 --> 01:00:44.169]  Here's the bottom of the rabbit hole.
[01:00:45.034 --> 01:00:57.486]  There's a war on for your soul, a war on for your consciousness, a war on for your mind, a war to artificially direct your brain to direct your spirit instead of the other way around.
[01:00:57.486 --> 01:01:07.135]  They are assuming a technological takeover, a technocracy, and they've rolled out the Trojan horse of technology that's neutral.
[01:01:07.992 --> 01:01:12.053]  And they've left it pretty much alone to get us all addicted.
[01:01:12.053 --> 01:01:13.513]  This is in their own words.
[01:01:13.513 --> 01:01:17.454]  And now that we're on the line, they're about to plant the hook.
[01:01:17.454 --> 01:01:18.974]  The worm's in our mouth.
[01:01:18.974 --> 01:01:21.735]  The hook has not gone through our mouth yet.
[01:01:21.735 --> 01:01:26.136]  But they are about to pull back on that rod and they are about to plant that hook.
[01:01:26.136 --> 01:01:33.757]  Did we lose Alex?
[01:01:33.757 --> 01:01:35.218]  I think we just lost him.
[01:01:35.218 --> 01:01:35.378]  Yeah.
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:45.106]  Well, Alex is going to come back to us and I had something that we saw on one of these videos talking about the car companies asserting ownership over everything that you have.
[01:01:45.106 --> 01:01:50.749]  This is a comment from someone called, that went with MPG827 on YouTube.
[01:01:50.749 --> 01:01:54.432]  He said, my friend had a BMW and he had to put in a battery.
[01:01:54.432 --> 01:01:55.552]  So he did it himself.
[01:01:55.552 --> 01:01:58.074]  I mean, that's, I don't even consider that working on your own car.
[01:01:58.074 --> 01:02:00.395]  He said it went dead after a day.
[01:02:00.395 --> 01:02:02.317]  He called the BMW dealership.
[01:02:02.317 --> 01:02:03.257]  They took a look at him.
[01:02:03.257 --> 01:02:04.018]  You got Alex back?
[01:02:04.018 --> 01:02:04.778]  Okay, go ahead, Alex.
[01:02:04.778 --> 01:02:05.659]  I'll finish the story later.
[01:02:06.263 --> 01:02:06.723]  No, no, no.
[01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:07.263]  Sorry, David.
[01:02:07.263 --> 01:02:08.444]  I'm going to get off right now.
[01:02:08.444 --> 01:02:10.965]  It's just people need to understand something.
[01:02:10.965 --> 01:02:29.112]  We're under attack by mainstream media, by government, by White House-run Media Matters, by, no exaggeration, probably ten major newspapers a day, a magazine a week, nightly news shows once a week, everything from Nightline to The Daily Show, because we're over the target.
[01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:30.452]  And I'm not worried about me.
[01:02:30.452 --> 01:02:32.013]  I'm worried about this mission failing.
[01:02:32.651 --> 01:02:35.734]  Folks, the reason we're under attack is we know what we're talking about.
[01:02:35.734 --> 01:02:38.777]  And the online trolls and all of it, because they're scared to death.
[01:02:38.777 --> 01:02:47.284]  Let's cut Alex Jones out of the equation, or David Nye, or Jakari Jackson, or Darren McBreen, or LeeAnn McAdoo, or any of our great crew.
[01:02:47.284 --> 01:02:49.066]  All of this is happening.
[01:02:49.066 --> 01:02:51.188]  What are you going to do about it?
[01:02:51.188 --> 01:02:55.532]  The globalists are coming in to micromanage and destroy your free will.
[01:02:55.532 --> 01:02:58.955]  They're openly saying they're going to, as I told people again 50 years ago,
[01:02:59.736 --> 01:03:02.558]  Start taxing you by the mile, claiming that you're not a safe driver.
[01:03:02.558 --> 01:03:07.501]  And then finally, machines ought to do everything for us.
[01:03:07.501 --> 01:03:10.043]  They're building a world where humans won't be needed.
[01:03:10.043 --> 01:03:11.924]  Not where we empower humanity.
[01:03:11.924 --> 01:03:13.966]  Not where we build a world for humanity.
[01:03:13.966 --> 01:03:16.387]  But where we say machines are better day one.
[01:03:16.387 --> 01:03:18.189]  Let them control everything.
[01:03:18.189 --> 01:03:19.930]  Let the calculators do the math.
[01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:21.191]  Let the cars do the driving.
[01:03:21.191 --> 01:03:24.453]  And we'll all just watch football.
[01:03:24.453 --> 01:03:27.395]  That's what Bill Joy, 16 years ago in Wired Magazine, wrote about.
[01:03:27.395 --> 01:03:28.636]  The decision
[01:03:29.631 --> 01:03:31.392]  Has been made to give us bread and circus.
[01:03:31.392 --> 01:03:34.314]  He says this at a meeting with 200 top lovelies.
[01:03:34.314 --> 01:03:35.815]  The decision has been made.
[01:03:35.815 --> 01:03:37.356]  Listen to me, folks.
[01:03:37.356 --> 01:03:47.001]  To entertain you to death, get you anesthetized, dumped down, drugged out, and sterilize you so humans just phase out and the elite merge with machines.
[01:03:47.001 --> 01:03:49.863]  Now, again, you're living in a science fiction movie.
[01:03:49.863 --> 01:03:51.084]  What are you going to do about it?
[01:03:51.084 --> 01:03:53.985]  The reason you feel empty is because you bought into the world system.
[01:03:53.985 --> 01:03:54.746]  I'm talking to new listeners.
[01:03:55.402 --> 01:03:59.304]  You've bought into the idea that you can only be empowered by going deeper into the system.
[01:03:59.304 --> 01:04:01.506]  The system will not empower you.
[01:04:01.506 --> 01:04:08.029]  Resisting the system, building a real system based on human liberty and freedom and the golden rule is the only way.
[01:04:08.029 --> 01:04:11.511]  I'm going to throw it back to David Knight, and as I said, I'll be back live this Sunday.
[01:04:11.511 --> 01:04:12.152]  Great job, crew.
[01:04:13.268 --> 01:04:13.888]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:04:13.888 --> 01:04:18.391]  Yeah, I want to continue with this story because this is an amazing comment I saw on YouTube.
[01:04:18.391 --> 01:04:22.654]  Again, this guy reported that he had a friend with a BMW, had to replace the battery.
[01:04:22.654 --> 01:04:26.217]  He put it in himself after a day it went off.
[01:04:26.217 --> 01:04:30.900]  So he called the dealer and they said, you've got an aftermarket battery.
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.321]  They said it's unregistered.
[01:04:32.321 --> 01:04:37.864]  So what they did was they wirelessly over Wi-Fi, they registered his battery and charged him $150.
[01:04:40.626 --> 01:04:44.488]  More than it would have cost him to probably buy a battery from them.
[01:04:44.488 --> 01:04:45.868]  You don't have freedom.
[01:04:45.868 --> 01:04:47.129]  You don't own anything.
[01:04:47.129 --> 01:04:52.291]  Just as GM said, we can't conflate ownership of a vehicle with ownership of the underlying computer software.
[01:04:52.291 --> 01:04:53.671]  They're going to do it by copyright.
[01:04:53.671 --> 01:04:55.352]  They're going to assert they own everything.
[01:04:55.352 --> 01:04:55.712]  Stay with us.
[01:04:55.712 --> 01:05:00.094]  We're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:05:00.094 --> 01:05:04.836]  There's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now.
[01:05:05.572 --> 01:05:10.959]  And if you're wondering how on earth we ever got in this situation, well I'll tell you how.
[01:05:10.959 --> 01:05:16.987]  When the Democrats showed their true colors, you got angry and you elected Republicans.
[01:05:16.987 --> 01:05:22.214]  And then when the Republicans showed their true colors, you got angry and elected Democrats.
[01:05:22.654 --> 01:05:33.322]  And when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt and that neither side were looking out for your best interest, you acted like they were crazy.
[01:05:33.322 --> 01:05:41.028]  But the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
[01:05:41.528 --> 01:05:47.813]  That's why it is vitally important that you wake up, America, and break the matrix.
[01:05:47.813 --> 01:05:53.197]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Show.
[01:05:53.197 --> 01:05:55.579]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:05:58.826 --> 01:06:00.087]  Another major health threat.
[01:06:00.087 --> 01:06:05.069]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:06:05.069 --> 01:06:07.730]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:14.773]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:06:14.773 --> 01:06:17.794]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:06:17.794 --> 01:06:20.735]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:06:20.735 --> 01:06:22.756]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:06:22.756 --> 01:06:25.577]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:06:25.657 --> 01:06:31.399]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:06:31.399 --> 01:06:34.900]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:38.001]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:06:38.001 --> 01:06:45.303]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[01:07:41.988 --> 01:07:45.731]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:45.731 --> 01:07:46.812]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.836 --> 01:08:17.177]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:17.177 --> 01:08:18.957]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:08:18.957 --> 01:08:25.400]  We just heard from Alex Jones, the last segment, explaining to us where this is all going with these black boxes.
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:30.582]  You know, I look at this and quite frankly, I think that's a very good metaphor for what our government has become.
[01:08:30.582 --> 01:08:37.845]  In engineering terms, we always used to talk about black boxes as this closed system where you didn't, you couldn't see how it worked.
[01:08:38.610 --> 01:08:43.473]  It might have a function, but you could not look at the internal parts of it.
[01:08:43.473 --> 01:08:44.773]  That's what our government has become.
[01:08:44.773 --> 01:08:48.496]  It's become this closed system that we can't examine.
[01:08:48.496 --> 01:08:58.281]  And I think these black boxes are now becoming, as we've got in our cars, they're like the black boxes you saw in airplanes, where basically they would record and track everything the pilots did.
[01:08:58.281 --> 01:08:59.722]  That's another aspect of our government.
[01:08:59.722 --> 01:09:01.423]  So not only can you not see into it,
[01:09:02.116 --> 01:09:08.243]  But it records and tracks everything that you do, and that's what they're doing on your cars so that they can track and tax you.
[01:09:08.243 --> 01:09:09.184]  I think that's what we ought to call them.
[01:09:09.184 --> 01:09:12.568]  Instead of a black box, we ought to call them track and tax.
[01:09:12.568 --> 01:09:14.150]  That's the true function of these things.
[01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:15.611]  Let's start getting honest with this.
[01:09:15.611 --> 01:09:16.753]  I think language means something.
[01:09:17.159 --> 01:09:18.401]  We're going to go to Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:09:18.401 --> 01:09:24.870]  Just before we do though, I want to let you know that we've got a special at InfoWarsLife.com this month.
[01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:32.561]  You can get two bottles of Survival Shield X2, that's our nascent iodine, and you can get one bottle of Fluoride Shield for free.
[01:09:33.442 --> 01:09:36.725]  Now we know that fluoride lowers IQ.
[01:09:36.725 --> 01:09:38.086]  We've seen that in tests.
[01:09:38.086 --> 01:09:42.911]  We know that many countries like Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, they're removing fluoride from the water.
[01:09:42.911 --> 01:09:49.177]  80% of the cities in the US, however, are fluoridated and we cannot get them to listen to us.
[01:09:49.177 --> 01:09:52.080]  So one of the things you can do is try to filter it out of your water.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:52.740]  You can also
[01:09:53.621 --> 01:10:05.452]  When you're at home, but you can also use Fluoride Shield for those times when you're away from home, you're going to get it and things that you drink, if you drink anything that's bottled, you're probably going to get fluoride because it is so pervasive in the United States.
[01:10:05.452 --> 01:10:11.858]  So, for this month only, you can get a free bottle of Fluoride Shield when you purchase two Survival Shield X2 bottles.
[01:10:11.858 --> 01:10:15.421]  Again, that's at Infowarslife.com and we have 50% off of Silver Bullet.
[01:10:15.421 --> 01:10:16.822]  $15 savings per bottle.
[01:10:19.994 --> 01:10:22.638]  Let's go to Paul Joseph Watson in the UK.
[01:10:22.638 --> 01:10:32.633]  Paul, you've got a story up about the Southern Poverty Law Center attacking Oath Keepers, attacking us, attacking Gary Franchi's operation.
[01:10:32.633 --> 01:10:33.074]  Next news.
[01:10:34.335 --> 01:10:46.486]  These are a bunch of lawyers you'd think that maybe they would appreciate that people should have their day in court, that there should be a due process, that there is a chain of title on these minds, and yet they don't.
[01:10:46.486 --> 01:10:58.636]  They simply move this into their rhetoric of hate, trying to divide us, trying to demonize people who want to have those things, who want to have due process, who want to have property rights.
[01:10:58.636 --> 01:10:59.357]  Your comments, Paul.
[01:11:00.532 --> 01:11:14.945]  Well, the SPLC, as we've documented for years, is basically this for-profit group which poses as a civil rights organization while peddling hate in the name of stopping hate.
[01:11:14.945 --> 01:11:23.113]  So they came out with this really quite amateurish article yesterday about the Sugar Pine mine dispute in Oregon.
[01:11:23.733 --> 01:11:31.897]  With a headline, Oath Keepers Descend Upon Oregon With Dreams Of Armed Confrontation Over Mining Dispute.
[01:11:31.897 --> 01:11:41.882]  And what's amazing, just as a kick-off, is the content of the article disproves the headline in the first three paragraphs.
[01:11:41.882 --> 01:11:42.803]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:11:43.223 --> 01:11:51.725]  In the third paragraph, they quote Oath Keepers who put out a statement last week which said, quote, So in the third paragraph,
[01:12:03.368 --> 01:12:13.418]  Oath Keepers say they're not promoting armed confrontation, yet the headline of this piece by the SPLC says they're, quote, dreaming of armed confrontation.
[01:12:13.418 --> 01:12:23.909]  Then again, later on in the article, they quote Joseph Rice, the security coordinator for Josephine County Chapter of the Oath Keepers, who stated, quote,
[01:12:24.685 --> 01:12:31.268]  If you're on a fringe element and if you're here to protest or provoke a reaction with the federal government, I don't want you here.
[01:12:31.268 --> 01:12:32.348]  Let me repeat that.
[01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:37.590]  If you're here to protest and to provoke a reaction with the federal government, I do not need you.
[01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:51.736]  So they actually quote the Oath Keepers on two separate occasions saying they're not there to promote or to provoke violence, yet simultaneously demonizing the Oath Keepers and saying that they're trying to provoke violence.
[01:12:53.137 --> 01:12:54.438]  Yeah, that's what they do with the headlines.
[01:12:54.438 --> 01:12:57.360]  It barely even needs me to write an article in response.
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:02.524]  They discredit and disprove their own premise within their own article.
[01:13:02.524 --> 01:13:09.970]  Well, they basically, just if you look at about the first five or six words of the article, what began as a paper dispute.
[01:13:09.970 --> 01:13:20.879]  If you look at that interview that I had with a spokesperson from the Glease Mining District, and they put that in their article, but of course, I think people just look at these headlines, they don't read the SPLC articles, they don't
[01:13:20.879 --> 01:13:25.441]  Don't watch the videos that are embedded there, they just come in at the bottom based on their comments.
[01:13:25.441 --> 01:13:28.382]  I don't think that they read the article or they watched the video.
[01:13:28.382 --> 01:13:34.784]  It did not begin as a paper dispute, and of course we go through that in the video, but let's talk about how the SPLC began.
[01:13:34.784 --> 01:13:43.488]  You know, this is a guy, Morris Dees, who set out the civil rights movement of the 1960s, except for the fact that he was in it at the very beginning.
[01:13:44.417 --> 01:13:55.028]  He worked for George Wallace, and he also got involved in a particular case where the KKK beat protesters, burned their bus.
[01:13:55.028 --> 01:14:03.017]  He defended the Ku Klux Klan, and he made enough money off of that as equivalent to what the median family income was at that time.
[01:14:03.217 --> 01:14:13.682]  And then he set out the entire civil rights movement, and he didn't get involved again until the 1970s when he came back into politics with George McGovern.
[01:14:13.682 --> 01:14:18.004]  In the meantime, he and his partner were out making millions of dollars.
[01:14:18.004 --> 01:14:21.706]  As many people on the left have criticized him, and you can see that picture now if you're looking at that.
[01:14:21.706 --> 01:14:27.669]  Yeah, that guy on the bottom that's being kicked, that was not the person he's representing.
[01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:30.110]  He's representing that guy right there doing the kicking.
[01:14:30.670 --> 01:14:33.612]  The white supremacist, the KKK guy.
[01:14:33.612 --> 01:14:35.113]  Those are the guys that he defended.
[01:14:35.113 --> 01:14:40.056]  And then he got back involved in politics after making millions in direct mail marketing.
[01:14:40.056 --> 01:14:48.422]  He got involved with the McGovern campaign and got a mailing list of 700,000 people and then came back in as a champion of civil liberties.
[01:14:49.082 --> 01:14:50.483]  Absolute baloney.
[01:14:50.483 --> 01:14:55.164]  This guy is just profiting, as I point out in that video, Prophets of Hate.
[01:14:55.164 --> 01:15:00.826]  His whole purpose seems to be to profit from hate, and of course he's stuck people on the Family Research Council.
[01:15:00.826 --> 01:15:06.047]  Basically, the guy that went in to shoot up people at the Family Research Council said that he was inspired by the SPLC.
[01:15:06.047 --> 01:15:07.508]  That was just a couple years ago, Paul.
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:16.424]  Yeah, this is an organisation headed by Maurice Dees that makes millions and millions of dollars a year.
[01:15:16.424 --> 01:15:18.745]  In fact, they make $20 million in profits.
[01:15:18.745 --> 01:15:24.148]  They take in around $40 million and spend about $20 million in their venerable cause.
[01:15:24.148 --> 01:15:25.908]  So they actually keep $20 million.
[01:15:25.908 --> 01:15:28.150]  We can get into what they do with that later.
[01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:41.239]  Their whole modus operandi is to demonize constitutionalists, libertarians, gun owners, patriots, and portray them as violent domestic extremists and terror threats.
[01:15:41.239 --> 01:15:51.206]  When, as you mentioned, in 2012 this guy Corkins, who went into a Family Research Council headquarters in Washington DC,
[01:15:52.147 --> 01:15:54.913]  Specifically with the aim of shooting the place up.
[01:15:54.913 --> 01:15:59.183]  Thankfully, from what I remember, a security guard stopped him from doing so.
[01:15:59.183 --> 01:16:00.025]  That's right.
[01:16:00.025 --> 01:16:01.348]  But he sighted!
[01:16:02.301 --> 01:16:29.484]  The SPLC, as an inspiration for that shooting, because they had listed the Family Research Council as a hate organisation, they called it an anti-gay organisation because they opposed gay marriage, on their website two years previously, which actually led to 22 Republican lawmakers taking out full-page ads in the Washington Post and the New York Times, basically calling out the SPLC.
[01:16:30.245 --> 01:16:45.873]  But what's dangerous about them, Paul, is not that they're inspiring a lone wolf shooter with hate, but that they are being used by the federal government to push this narrative that the biggest threat to our country are people who are conservatives, libertarians, Christians.
[01:16:45.873 --> 01:16:47.194]  The Southern Poverty Law Center
[01:16:47.814 --> 01:16:57.020]  Is what the FBI and the military use when they're indoctrinating law enforcement and the military that this is a training scenario that they're fighting for.
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:59.502]  That's what we've been talking about with this militarization of the police.
[01:16:59.502 --> 01:17:03.184]  If you go back and you look at these scenarios, they're getting all their talking points from the SPLC.
[01:17:03.184 --> 01:17:11.770]  The government loves to use them because they can pretend that this is some independent third party that's out there instead of it being 100% government propaganda.
[01:17:11.770 --> 01:17:16.593]  But they are linked completely with the government in terms of putting this narrative out there.
[01:17:16.593 --> 01:17:17.414]  That's where it's coming from.
[01:17:18.996 --> 01:17:26.504]  Yeah, we documented that in a report entitled, Confirmed, No Supporting Evidence for DHS Right-Wing Extremism Report.
[01:17:26.504 --> 01:17:39.297]  This was a report put out in 2009 by the Department of Homeland Security that again, in a similar vein to the MIAC report, listed libertarians, gun owners, constitutionalists as domestic terror threats.
[01:17:39.958 --> 01:17:56.381]  They got their information, and we found this out after an independent political group called the Americans for Limited Government filed a Freedom of Information Act request to find out how the DHS had designated all these groups as, quote, hate groups and domestic extremists.
[01:17:57.262 --> 01:18:04.027]  And the DHS responded by providing a list of about 50 URLs, internet links.
[01:18:04.027 --> 01:18:10.111]  That was the entire foundation of their report, to demonize all these groups as extremists.
[01:18:10.111 --> 01:18:14.874]  So they didn't do any statistical analysis, they didn't interview any of these groups.
[01:18:14.874 --> 01:18:21.899]  An agent went on the internet and scoured a few websites, one of which was the SPLC.
[01:18:21.899 --> 01:18:25.061]  And in fact, 11 of these 50 or so links
[01:18:25.601 --> 01:18:34.867]  Also came from a fake news website that puts out hoax articles, which are completely ridiculous, called What Does It Mean?
[01:18:34.867 --> 01:18:39.910]  They actually used a fake news website to create this huge right-wing extremism report.
[01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:45.173]  So it just shows you the kind of company that the DHS and the SPLC keeps.
[01:18:45.173 --> 01:18:45.934]  And then, as you said,
[01:18:46.454 --> 01:18:50.335]  They use that information as a kind of echo chamber back between the S.P.L.C.
[01:18:50.335 --> 01:18:51.596]  and the D.H.S.
[01:18:51.596 --> 01:18:55.157]  to demonize all these groups as domestic extremists.
[01:18:55.157 --> 01:19:06.962]  And it perfectly fits into their agenda, which we've documented, which is basically to malign anyone who doesn't espouse the same leftist viewpoints as the S.P.L.C.
[01:19:06.962 --> 01:19:09.983]  as dangerous domestic terror threats.
[01:19:09.983 --> 01:19:10.683]  Absolutely.
[01:19:10.683 --> 01:19:12.684]  They're looking at political opponents.
[01:19:12.684 --> 01:19:14.425]  They want to have a rationale to
[01:19:15.805 --> 01:19:17.586]  to attack political opponents.
[01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:19.566]  We've seen what they use the IRS for.
[01:19:19.566 --> 01:19:27.669]  But of course, what's much more dangerous when Homeland Security and the military and the police are doing that with force, going after the political opponents.
[01:19:27.669 --> 01:19:34.130]  And so, they use the Southern Poverty Law Center to try to portray these people as dangerous, as violent.
[01:19:34.130 --> 01:19:38.632]  And it's very interesting, I think, that it's noticeably absent from the Southern Poverty Law Center's site
[01:19:39.332 --> 01:19:47.797]  Any talk about radical Islam, except to characterize anybody who does talk about a threat from radical Islam as Islamophobes.
[01:19:47.797 --> 01:19:49.718]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:50.118]  Stay with us.

[01:21:58.233 --> 01:21:59.293]  Quantitative easing.
[01:21:59.293 --> 01:22:01.414]  Unemployment at depression levels.

[01:22:04.716 --> 01:22:05.476]  Treasuries.
[01:22:05.476 --> 01:22:11.198]  At the end of 2008, the time of TARP, the national debt was at 11 trillion gold, trading around $850 per ounce.
[01:22:12.839 --> 01:22:19.501]  Close to 2012, the national debt exceeded $16.4 trillion, gold doubled to $1,600 bronze.
[01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:22.742]  The $20 trillion threshold for the national debt is inevitable.
[01:22:22.742 --> 01:22:26.863]  Politicians in Washington have a ferocious appetite for spending and stimulus.
[01:22:26.863 --> 01:22:29.563]  What's worse, a printing press to finance.
[01:22:29.563 --> 01:22:35.165]  A hundred years ago, we had a gold standard to limit this madness, but now you have to adopt your own gold standard.
[01:22:35.325 --> 01:22:37.126]  Don't be fooled with paper promises.

[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:08.882]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:08.882 --> 01:24:12.103]  I'm David Knight and we have joining us from the UK, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:24:12.103 --> 01:24:22.108]  We're talking about the hit piece that the SPLC did on the Oath Keepers as well as the Miners in Oregon, merely trying to get their day in court.
[01:24:23.277 --> 01:24:26.119]  The miners were told that they had to shut everything down in a very short time.
[01:24:26.119 --> 01:24:40.811]  They were given a deadline of tomorrow saying that they had to remove all the buildings, remove all their equipment, fill up all the holes in a mine that has been there for 150 years, that they have a clear title to, that has been grandfathered in with all this legislation.
[01:24:40.811 --> 01:24:41.972]  They spent $10,000 trying to get answers.
[01:24:44.594 --> 01:24:46.715]  As to why the BLM was doing this.
[01:24:46.715 --> 01:24:49.117]  I had an interview with somebody from the mining district.
[01:24:49.117 --> 01:24:50.357]  He gave us an idea what it was.
[01:24:50.357 --> 01:24:56.441]  It was really just a petty vendetta from some BLM employees, I believe, in terms of talking to them.
[01:24:56.441 --> 01:24:57.762]  You can watch that interview yourself.
[01:24:57.762 --> 01:25:01.824]  They actually embedded it on the attack piece in the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:25:01.824 --> 01:25:07.468]  But as Paul pointed out, they have a very controversial headline saying that
[01:25:08.789 --> 01:25:19.033]  That they're dreaming of an armed confrontation with the BLM, and yet, in the body of the article, when they talk to people and get quotes from them, it's just the opposite.
[01:25:19.033 --> 01:25:20.993]  They do not want an armed confrontation.
[01:25:20.993 --> 01:25:22.254]  They are not provoking things.
[01:25:22.254 --> 01:25:24.455]  The people who are provoking things are the BLM.
[01:25:24.455 --> 01:25:26.135]  They simply want their due process.
[01:25:26.135 --> 01:25:28.996]  And you would expect that lawyers would understand that.
[01:25:28.996 --> 01:25:31.597]  But that's not what motivates the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:25:31.597 --> 01:25:36.259]  It's not motivated out of a desire to see people get due process or civil liberties.
[01:25:37.159 --> 01:25:50.529]  They have portrayed themselves as the defenders of civil rights against the Ku Klux Klan and yet the only time that he did anything, Morris Dees, the founder of the SPLC, the only time he ever did anything
[01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:55.271]  And the Civil Rights Movement was to defend the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:25:55.271 --> 01:26:07.176]  And then, as Harper's Magazine, a story called The Church of Morris Dees, pointed out, in the 1960s, Morris Dees sat on the sidelines, honing his direct marketing skills, practicing law while the Civil Rights Movement engulfed the South.
[01:26:07.176 --> 01:26:07.856]  And here's this quote.
[01:26:08.536 --> 01:26:15.277]  From his partner, his business partner, Morris Deese and I shared the overriding purpose of making a pile of money.
[01:26:15.277 --> 01:26:31.700]  And that's exactly what they're doing, except now what they're doing is they are operating as shills for Homeland Security, for the scenarios that are coming out of Homeland Security, the FBI, the military, portraying political enemies of the government as being dangerous terrorists.
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:34.461]  That's what's really underlying all this, isn't it, Paul?
[01:26:36.062 --> 01:26:44.727]  Exactly, and another point I make in the article is that interview that you did on this subject, they didn't use it as fair use.
[01:26:44.727 --> 01:26:46.227]  They didn't comment over it.
[01:26:46.227 --> 01:26:55.652]  They plagiarized entire content from our channel as well as the Next News Network and just put it on their own channel without even commenting over it.
[01:26:55.652 --> 01:26:58.494]  I mean, we could get that video pulled in a heartbeat.
[01:26:58.494 --> 01:27:00.314]  People do that to us all the time.
[01:27:00.314 --> 01:27:02.596]  But again, it just illustrates how amateurish they are.
[01:27:03.436 --> 01:27:08.222]  And what I find ironic about it is George Soros funds the SPLC.
[01:27:08.222 --> 01:27:20.716]  So while he's funding this group in the name of stopping violent extremism, he's also funding Black Lives Matter, which in many cases, as in Ferguson, Missouri during the riots, engaged in violent extremism.
[01:27:20.716 --> 01:27:22.918]  So again, another complete contradiction.
[01:27:23.499 --> 01:27:26.020]  And of course he's funding the Neo-Nazis in the Ukraine as well.
[01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:27.701]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:27.701 --> 01:27:32.924]  I think it's very interesting, Paul, how Morris Dees quickly switched sides, just like the Democrat Party did.
[01:27:32.924 --> 01:27:36.305]  You know, we had Robert Byrd, who was in the Ku Klux Klan, Senator Robert Byrd.
[01:27:36.305 --> 01:27:37.466]  We had George Wallace.
[01:27:37.466 --> 01:27:43.108]  The Democrat Party had been playing racial politics, but they were on the side of the white supremacists up until the Civil Rights Movement.
[01:27:43.108 --> 01:27:45.750]  Then all of a sudden, they just did a real quick pivot and a 180.
[01:27:46.730 --> 01:27:57.197]  And then after that was over, Morsties came back in and reinvented himself as being on the side of civil rights and opposed to the Ku Klux Klan, just like the Democrat Party did.
[01:27:57.197 --> 01:28:01.560]  Yeah, and they actually abandoned civil rights cases that aren't making them any money.
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:03.301]  They've done that before.
[01:28:03.301 --> 01:28:05.782]  Also, you know, it's like arms manufacturers.
[01:28:05.782 --> 01:28:12.707]  They need to continuously invent enemies to keep the profits rolling in, which is exactly what the SPLC does.
[01:28:13.207 --> 01:28:23.320]  The good news is that, I think it was last year or a couple of years ago, the FBI actually removed them from their list of resources for, quote, hate crimes resources.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:29.828]  So now they've been completely discredited that the actual federal government itself is backing away from them.
[01:28:30.779 --> 01:28:31.539]  Yeah, well they have.
[01:28:31.539 --> 01:28:33.320]  They put that out there as a headline.
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:35.561]  They still link to it a little bit further down.
[01:28:35.561 --> 01:28:42.405]  So we all looked at that and even the FRC, the Family Research Council, was real happy that it looked like we'd had a victory.
[01:28:42.405 --> 01:28:46.047]  But they're still doing that and they're still using it in their training scenarios.
[01:28:46.047 --> 01:28:48.588]  And that's the thing that really concerns me.
[01:28:48.588 --> 01:28:52.430]  But one of the other things out of this article, the Church of Morrisey's, I thought was interesting.
[01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:55.311]  And we talk about it in the video that we embedded on the article.
[01:28:55.311 --> 01:29:00.194]  It was a report I did about a year ago called The Prophets of Hate, P-R-O-F-I-T-S.
[01:29:00.774 --> 01:29:03.035]  And this is a quote from Harper's Magazine.
[01:29:03.035 --> 01:29:14.002]  They say, today the SPLC spends most of its time and money on a relentless fundraising campaign, peddling memberships in the Church of Tolerance, with all the zeal of a circuit rider passing the collection plate.
[01:29:14.002 --> 01:29:18.865]  And here's a quote from a former associate of Morse Dee's, Millard Farmer.
[01:29:18.865 --> 01:29:24.368]  He says, he's the Jim and Tammy Faye Baker of the Civil Rights Movement.
[01:29:24.368 --> 01:29:28.051]  He says, and I don't mean to malign Jim and Tammy Faye Baker.
[01:29:29.011 --> 01:29:31.153]  We're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:29:31.153 --> 01:29:38.058]  We're also going to talk about this article that he's got PayPal asserts copyright ownership over all intellectual property of its users.
[01:29:38.058 --> 01:29:40.399]  How about that?
[01:29:40.399 --> 01:29:45.523]  The corporations think they own everything, and they're going to make that come true if we don't stop them.
[01:29:45.523 --> 01:29:45.923]  Stay with us.
[01:29:45.923 --> 01:29:48.325]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:48.325 --> 01:29:49.726]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.726 --> 01:29:52.248]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.248 --> 01:29:54.910]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.284 --> 01:30:00.905]  Freedom and liberty lovers, listen up!
[01:30:00.905 --> 01:30:07.449]  The Republic of Liberland is looking for citizens to inhabit what used to be a three-mile patch of no-man's land between Serbia and Croatia.
[01:30:07.449 --> 01:30:17.196]  With the motto, Live and Let Live, Liberland's creator, Vit Jetlinka, wants to create a European tax haven, where honest people could prosper with minimal to no interference from a centralized government.
[01:30:17.196 --> 01:30:24.601]  So far, he has received 250,000 prospective citizen applications, as well as financial pledges to set up a state and telecom infrastructure.
[01:30:24.801 --> 01:30:41.544]  Sputnik reports that requirements for a prospective Liberland citizen must have respect for other people and respect the opinions of others, regardless of race, ethnicity, orientation, or religion, have respect for private ownership, which is untouchable, do not have communist, Nazi, or any other extremist past, and were not punished for a past criminal offense.
[01:30:41.544 --> 01:30:42.945]  But don't pack your bags just yet.
[01:30:42.945 --> 01:30:45.565]  Croatia has reported that it will not recognize the micronation.
[01:30:45.565 --> 01:30:46.405]  That's right!
[01:30:46.405 --> 01:30:49.226]  We can't let people run their own lives with minimal government harassment.
[01:30:49.386 --> 01:30:54.010]  That would prove we no longer need a massive central government and the control freak warmongers can't have that.
[01:30:54.010 --> 01:30:54.831]  Go back to work.
[01:30:54.831 --> 01:30:57.133]  We still have a few more days till Tax Freedom Day.
[01:30:57.133 --> 01:30:59.275]  Rob Due for InfoWars.com.
[01:30:59.275 --> 01:31:03.659]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.

[01:31:29.045 --> 01:31:30.066]  Alex Jones here.
[01:31:30.066 --> 01:31:39.353]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:31:39.353 --> 01:31:43.137]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[01:31:43.137 --> 01:31:51.503]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.

[01:31:53.805 --> 01:31:54.846]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:58.823 --> 01:31:59.764]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:31:59.764 --> 01:32:00.324]  Good, brother.
[01:32:00.324 --> 01:32:02.286]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:32:02.286 --> 01:32:03.987]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:32:03.987 --> 01:32:08.050]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:32:08.050 --> 01:32:10.653]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:32:10.653 --> 01:32:13.075]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:32:13.075 --> 01:32:21.001]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:32:21.281 --> 01:32:24.485]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:32:24.485 --> 01:32:26.007]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:32:26.007 --> 01:32:29.070]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:30.712]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:32:30.712 --> 01:32:36.118]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[01:32:36.178 --> 01:32:36.779]  We're good to go.
[01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:10.116]  Another time in the Age of Wonder.
[01:33:26.305 --> 01:33:30.910]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:36.936]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:42.978 --> 01:33:44.259]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:44.259 --> 01:33:47.923]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[01:33:47.923 --> 01:33:52.668]  We're also going to have John Rappaport joining us in the next hour.
[01:33:52.668 --> 01:33:57.293]  Before I go back to Paul, I wanted to let you know that we have a special on Silver Bullet, 50% off.
[01:33:58.314 --> 01:34:00.755]  That's about $15 per bottle savings.
[01:34:00.755 --> 01:34:03.477]  And of course, that's our 30 parts per million.
[01:34:03.477 --> 01:34:06.519]  It's triple the strength of other colloidal silver products.
[01:34:06.519 --> 01:34:07.679]  It's a very high concentration.
[01:34:07.679 --> 01:34:13.343]  It's heavily concentrated in pure deionized water, electrically stabilized to improve potency.
[01:34:13.343 --> 01:34:18.746]  So it's something you can store in your medicine's cabinet for years because of that stabilization.
[01:34:19.426 --> 01:34:24.171]  We often run out of this, but right now we have it in stock and offering the biggest discount we've ever had.
[01:34:24.171 --> 01:34:27.334]  50% off, $15 per bottle savings.
[01:34:27.334 --> 01:34:32.059]  Also, we have another special 2X2, Survival Shield X2, that's our nascent iodine.
[01:34:32.059 --> 01:34:37.004]  If you buy two of those, you get one Fluoride Shield bottle for free.
[01:34:37.004 --> 01:34:39.626]  Again, that is also at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:48.449]  Now Paul, I think, you know, as we're talking about this Southern Poverty Law Center attack on the minors who are just trying to get their due process from the BLM.
[01:34:50.203 --> 01:35:06.017]  And on Oath Keepers, who are doing security to make sure that that's going to happen, because the BLM was basically not replying to any of their requests, saying, what is the basis of your demands to stop and cease the operation of this mine that's been in operation for the last 150 years?
[01:35:06.017 --> 01:35:06.898]  What is the basis of that?
[01:35:06.898 --> 01:35:16.606]  They couldn't get any answers other than, because we say so, and you better do it by, and the date was tomorrow, that they were going to have to get everything removed, the holes filled in.
[01:35:17.327 --> 01:35:28.733]  So basically Oath Keepers was requested by the mining operator there and they came out there and they're providing security so these people have a chance to go through the due process to go through courts.
[01:35:28.733 --> 01:35:31.595]  I would think that lawyers would appreciate that but what we've seen Paul
[01:35:32.532 --> 01:35:41.295]  As we've seen with this administration, we've seen naked political persecution of political opponents of his using the IRS.
[01:35:41.295 --> 01:35:44.696]  Something that is far beyond what Richard Nixon got impeached for.
[01:35:44.696 --> 01:35:52.138]  And what I'm concerned about is that we're going to see law enforcement being used against people who are political enemies of the government.
[01:35:52.618 --> 01:36:00.248]  Because that's what the Southern Poverty Law Center is being used for by Homeland Security, by the military in their training scenarios.
[01:36:00.248 --> 01:36:03.812]  We have to remember that this is continually getting worse.
[01:36:03.812 --> 01:36:11.721]  As I pointed out, look at the way they're using the IRS and how Nixon was impeached for far less than they're doing and yet they do it openly now.
[01:36:12.714 --> 01:36:21.123]  Now they're using the Southern Poverty Law Center as a beard to try to portray political opponents as hateful, as terrorists, as racist.
[01:36:21.123 --> 01:36:27.149]  But the day is coming when they're just going to do it like they're doing with the IRS because they can and because they can get away with it.
[01:36:28.703 --> 01:36:41.347]  Yeah, and they're working hand-in-hand with the DHS, who openly fund studies that say Americans who are, quote, reverent of individual liberty are on a par with Islamic terrorists.
[01:36:41.347 --> 01:36:42.687]  I mean, that's how bad it is.
[01:36:42.687 --> 01:36:43.147]  Exactly.
[01:36:43.147 --> 01:36:48.649]  Going back to the financial issue, I mean, talking about profits of hate, the SPLC has
[01:36:49.409 --> 01:36:53.134]  Two hundred and thirty eight million dollars in assets.
[01:36:53.134 --> 01:36:55.958]  This is a civil rights organization.
[01:36:55.958 --> 01:37:04.769]  And in fact, they lost 50 million during the year of the financial collapse in 2009 because they had invested most of it
[01:37:05.610 --> 01:37:13.232]  This is donations coming from people to fight civil rights cases from, you know, like liberals who have to pay their indulgences.
[01:37:13.232 --> 01:37:19.674]  They invested a ton of the money and lost 50 million during the couple of years of the stock market crash.
[01:37:19.674 --> 01:37:29.796]  And again, going back to Morris Dees, you compare him to Stephen Bright of the Southern Center for Human Rights, again another civil rights organization.
[01:37:29.796 --> 01:37:31.116]  Bright makes $11,000 a year as president.
[01:37:33.477 --> 01:37:40.925]  Morris Dees, who is already a multi-millionaire, makes $350,000 a year.
[01:37:40.925 --> 01:37:51.236]  So this is basically an organization that just contrives hate, creates enemies, like the armaments industry does to profit from war, to reap these vast profits again.
[01:37:52.242 --> 01:37:59.307]  They take in about $47 million a year and they keep $20 million of it after all their operating expenses.
[01:37:59.307 --> 01:38:00.928]  $14 to $20 million.
[01:38:00.928 --> 01:38:04.751]  So it's very lucrative to peddle this hate.
[01:38:04.751 --> 01:38:08.093]  And again, you can look at the Poplarski case.
[01:38:08.093 --> 01:38:09.274]  That was blamed on us.
[01:38:09.274 --> 01:38:12.556]  This guy who shot, what was it, three cops in Pittsburgh.
[01:38:13.291 --> 01:38:21.198]  When he left comments on our website saying how much he hated Alex Jones, yet the SPLC blamed that on us as well.
[01:38:21.198 --> 01:38:27.323]  Mark Potok went on CNN and said that the Boston bombing was probably done by quote, patriots.
[01:38:27.323 --> 01:38:27.744]  Yes.
[01:38:27.744 --> 01:38:34.970]  So they've been proven wrong time and time again, yet they're still peddling this hate because it's very lucrative for them.
[01:38:35.330 --> 01:38:37.551]  Yes, and it's a narrative that the government wants out there.
[01:38:37.551 --> 01:38:52.158]  When you're talking about the money, this article that was back from the year 2000, the Church of Morris Dees and Harper's Magazine, and it truly is a way of getting an indulgence, doing penance for many of these liberals, but they need to understand that even back then,
[01:38:52.398 --> 01:38:54.800]  Of course, that was 15 years ago.
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:03.968]  They point out they'd made $44 million, $27 million of it from fundraising, and $17 million from stocks and other investments, as you're pointing out, Paul.
[01:39:03.968 --> 01:39:12.495]  But half of what they took in from fundraising, less than half of what they took in from fundraising, they took in $27 million, they only spent $13 million on their civil rights program.
[01:39:12.495 --> 01:39:16.438]  They say making it one of the most profitable charities in the country.
[01:39:16.858 --> 01:39:17.878]  And so that's what it is.
[01:39:17.878 --> 01:39:21.240]  It's all about the money, but it's also about the power.
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:26.002]  It's also about being used in a narrative that the government wants to sell to people.
[01:39:26.002 --> 01:39:35.285]  As I pointed out earlier, Paul, they don't talk about radical Islam except to criticize anybody who does talk about it as saying, well, that's proof that they're Islamophobes.
[01:39:35.285 --> 01:39:38.386]  That's proof that they're dangerous, hate-filled racists.
[01:39:38.386 --> 01:39:42.228]  If you talk about radical Islam whatsoever, you get put on their hate watch.
[01:39:43.683 --> 01:39:51.653]  Yeah, and that's because they're an extremely hypocritical leftist organization that's politically driven and completely biased.
[01:39:51.653 --> 01:39:55.878]  So why on earth is the federal government using them as a resource?
[01:39:55.878 --> 01:40:01.085]  And again, going back to the violence issue, they had somebody in the comments on their website, another one of their
[01:40:01.565 --> 01:40:12.750]  Liberal tolerant supporters, like the guy who shot up the Family Research Council, who openly called for Alex Jones' execution, this comment remained on their website for over four months.
[01:40:12.750 --> 01:40:18.533]  So do they really care about preventing hate and domestic violence when we see that kind of example?
[01:40:18.533 --> 01:40:21.374]  And again, they've been discredited over and over again.
[01:40:23.135 --> 01:40:26.257]  Completely overhyped the Hutteri militia case.
[01:40:26.257 --> 01:40:27.198]  That collapsed.
[01:40:27.198 --> 01:40:28.639]  They were all acquitted.
[01:40:28.639 --> 01:40:31.941]  So they've just got egg on their face time and time again.
[01:40:31.941 --> 01:40:38.044]  And it's just so easy to write these response pieces whenever the SPLC attacks us.
[01:40:38.044 --> 01:40:44.528]  Because we've just got years and years of examples where they've got it spectacularly wrong in every single case.
[01:40:44.528 --> 01:40:44.949]  Absolutely.
[01:40:45.529 --> 01:40:49.715]  Let's talk about this other article that you've got up today that went up just a little while ago.
[01:40:49.715 --> 01:40:54.542]  PayPal asserts copyright ownership over all intellectual property of its users.
[01:40:54.542 --> 01:40:57.225]  Now, of course, they're doing this through a new user agreement.
[01:40:57.225 --> 01:40:59.969]  I want you to break that down, but Paul, look at this.
[01:40:59.969 --> 01:41:00.770]  Everywhere I turn...
[01:41:01.371 --> 01:41:07.113]  I see big corporations asserting copyright ownership over everything, over things that they don't own.
[01:41:07.113 --> 01:41:15.797]  We need to understand that this is the fundamental basis for how they're going to control the Internet, how they're going to control you, is how they're going to shut down your car.
[01:41:15.797 --> 01:41:23.320]  We've talked about how General Motors and other automobile manufacturers are asserting that you don't have any right to work on your car, you don't own your car.
[01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:28.442]  It is merely a licensing agreement, as John Deere talks about.
[01:41:28.442 --> 01:41:31.323]  They own everything because they own copyrights.
[01:41:31.323 --> 01:41:41.026]  And this is the fundamental basis of the way they're going to come at the Internet, saying you've got a copyright violation, so we can just shut down your website based on mere accusation.
[01:41:41.026 --> 01:41:45.888]  And it is woven throughout the Transatlantic and Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[01:41:45.888 --> 01:41:48.769]  But let's talk about this particular case here with PayPal.
[01:41:48.769 --> 01:41:49.789]  Break this down for the users.
[01:41:50.959 --> 01:42:02.353]  Well, yeah, this is key, as you said, because it ties into TTIP, which of course they classified under national security, obviously because if anybody actually found out what was truly in it, they would be horrified.
[01:42:02.353 --> 01:42:07.740]  That's going through at the moment, obviously allowing foreign corporations to change US law.
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:13.044]  But a business owner sent me this link and nobody else has reported this.
[01:42:13.044 --> 01:42:15.786]  We're the only news organization to report this.
[01:42:15.786 --> 01:42:23.752]  PayPal has announced that it's going to update its Terms of Agreement, Terms of Service, effective July 1st this year.
[01:42:24.773 --> 01:42:27.995]  And this is what they say in their own terms of agreement.
[01:42:27.995 --> 01:42:45.108]  Quote, when providing us with content or posting content, in each case for publication whether on or offline using the services, you grant the PayPal Group a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sub-licensable,
[01:42:45.888 --> 01:43:00.073]  Right to exercise any and all copyright, publicity, trademarks, database rights and intellectual property you have in the content in any media known now or in the future and it goes on and on.
[01:43:00.073 --> 01:43:06.376]  So basically if you're a website owner or if you're a business owner who uses PayPal to take payments
[01:43:07.196 --> 01:43:20.887]  From what this says, and you know we need copyright lawyers to comment on this because none have done so as of this moment, I asked four different intellectual property experts to comment on this so hopefully we'll get an update to it.
[01:43:20.887 --> 01:43:27.052]  But you know if you've got a website or a business and you use PayPal services to take payments, to me this reads as if
[01:43:27.632 --> 01:43:37.556]  They're claiming complete intellectual property ownership over anything you put on that website, anything you publish, again, online or offline.
[01:43:37.556 --> 01:43:38.676]  That's amazing.
[01:43:38.676 --> 01:43:40.097]  I mean, it looks pretty extensive.
[01:43:40.097 --> 01:43:51.361]  Yeah, it looks pretty extensive when they're talking about worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sub-licensable right to exercise any and all copyright, publicity, trademarks, database rights, and intellectual property rights you have in content.
[01:43:51.981 --> 01:43:54.123]  I mean, that is pretty amazing.
[01:43:54.123 --> 01:43:57.105]  Regardless of if that's restricted in any way whatsoever.
[01:43:57.105 --> 01:43:59.007]  See, that's the way they sneak this stuff in, Paul.
[01:43:59.007 --> 01:44:05.472]  They put it in the fine print, just the same way that they're trying to sneak in these trade agreements, so-called trade agreements.
[01:44:05.472 --> 01:44:06.252]  They're sneaking it in.
[01:44:07.216 --> 01:44:10.397]  Quietly, privately, secretly, so that nobody can see it.
[01:44:10.397 --> 01:44:15.899]  They're going to have to pass it so that we can see what's in it, except that we have seen some of what's in it, because it's been leaked.
[01:44:15.899 --> 01:44:18.499]  Some of the aspects of it have been leaked by WikiLeaks.
[01:44:18.499 --> 01:44:20.120]  But that's the way these guys are operating.
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:24.081]  They're just, absolutely, say that they own this and then put it out.
[01:44:24.561 --> 01:44:25.602]  People need to understand that.
[01:44:25.602 --> 01:44:36.572]  They also need to understand, just like I pointed out earlier in the show, John Deere and General Motors are both pushing back against the idea that you own your car.
[01:44:36.572 --> 01:44:45.060]  And General Motors said, people are mistakenly conflating ownership of a vehicle with ownership of the underlying computer software in a vehicle.
[01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:48.503]  And as John Deere pointed out, we're just giving them a license.
[01:44:49.431 --> 01:44:51.712]  You know, you just have a implied license.
[01:44:51.712 --> 01:44:53.072]  You don't really own anything.
[01:44:53.072 --> 01:44:56.053]  That's the perspective of these corporations.
[01:44:56.053 --> 01:44:59.515]  Yeah, and they can revoke that license at any point.
[01:44:59.515 --> 01:45:14.760]  What's interesting about this is there was a huge controversy in 2012 where on Facebook you saw people posting status updates asserting that they maintained copyright ownership of their original content that they posted on Facebook.
[01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:28.447]  And that was quite a misnomer, because if you actually read Facebook's own terms, they merely stated that Facebook asserts the license to use and display that content, not that it owns the copyright to that content.
[01:45:28.447 --> 01:45:31.449]  So this PayPal TOS update
[01:45:31.969 --> 01:45:38.017]  Is a lot more draconian than the Facebook situation, which caused a lot of controversy back in 2012.
[01:45:38.017 --> 01:45:40.540]  And again, no one's reported on this.
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:46.448]  There are two blogs where a handful of people are freaking out about this.
[01:45:46.448 --> 01:45:48.671]  No news organization has picked it up.
[01:45:49.351 --> 01:45:55.874]  And again, as he said, they know that people don't read terms of service agreements, so they can slip this kind of stuff in.
[01:45:55.874 --> 01:46:06.758]  Whether it's legally enforceable after it gets publicity, which it should do, you know, I would be doubtful of that, but it just shows you the attitude that these huge corporations, and of course,
[01:46:07.887 --> 01:46:11.169]  You know, PayPal is not given its record.
[01:46:11.169 --> 01:46:14.792]  I mean, they froze WikiLeaks' account back in 2010.
[01:46:14.792 --> 01:46:18.955]  So they've got a history of targeting groups politically.
[01:46:18.955 --> 01:46:27.561]  The head of PayPal, one of the head developers, as we covered earlier this week, is now advocating that instead of a password, you would have a brain chip.
[01:46:28.021 --> 01:46:28.682]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:46:41.857 --> 01:46:44.299]  There are very few alternatives to PayPal.
[01:46:44.299 --> 01:46:51.104]  This is the problem we have when corporations get these kind of monopolies over things like payment systems.
[01:46:51.104 --> 01:46:58.009]  Because I've been using PayPal for, what, 15 years now, and I've never run across an alternative that works as well.
[01:46:58.009 --> 01:47:02.253]  So, I mean, that's how they maintain dominance over these sectors.
[01:47:02.253 --> 01:47:02.913]  Well, absolutely.
[01:47:02.913 --> 01:47:04.354]  And of course, one of the previous
[01:47:06.451 --> 01:47:15.099]  Top people at PayPal went on to form Palantir, which is involved with the PRISM program and working hand-in-glove with the CIA.
[01:47:15.099 --> 01:47:29.312]  These guys that are at the top, these guys that go to Bilderberg and hang out, just like we were talking about earlier in the show, David Petraeus, he turns over a bunch of information to his mistress and he just gets a slap on the wrist.
[01:47:30.493 --> 01:47:35.215]  Fine, that is 75% of one of his speaking engagements and a two-year probation.
[01:47:35.215 --> 01:47:42.618]  And look at how draconian, other than that, this administration has been coming after every kind of whistleblower.
[01:47:42.618 --> 01:47:51.302]  But of course, David Petraeus, not in exposing any criminal operations, and I guess that's why he got a pass, but also because he's part of the elite insiders.
[01:47:52.102 --> 01:47:57.285]  But I think, you know, Paul, when we look at this, it troubles me how copyrights are being used.
[01:47:57.285 --> 01:48:01.928]  And we need to have a discussion about what a legitimate copyright use is.
[01:48:01.928 --> 01:48:12.094]  Certainly, people should have some property rights, but the way this is being extended by these corporations is a way to turn everybody into serfs, into slaves who don't own anything.
[01:48:12.094 --> 01:48:15.436]  I remember the dispute about It's a Wonderful Life.
[01:48:15.436 --> 01:48:17.037]  That was something that was owned by a movie studio.
[01:48:18.118 --> 01:48:20.140]  That changed hands a number of times.
[01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:24.643]  It wasn't initially a successful movie, so nobody was really paying too much attention to it.
[01:48:24.643 --> 01:48:26.764]  It passed into the public domain.
[01:48:26.764 --> 01:48:34.850]  At that point, Ted Turner and his cable station picked it up and started playing it frequently, and that's when a new generation discovered that movie.
[01:48:34.850 --> 01:48:43.957]  It became very popular, and it was in the public domain and being freely sold by a number of different studios that were packaging it out there.
[01:48:44.577 --> 01:48:53.563]  And what they did was they went to court, and they asserted that they had copyright usage going back to the script.
[01:48:53.563 --> 01:49:05.632]  And doing that, because the script is a written piece of material, they have different copyright uses for that, so they used the script to basically take it back into copyright within the United States.
[01:49:05.632 --> 01:49:10.295]  Now, other countries are not recognizing that, because they did really allow that to slip.
[01:49:10.295 --> 01:49:13.397]  But that's the kind of legal tricks, just like you're seeing with this
[01:49:14.198 --> 01:49:14.358]  Yes.
[01:49:33.191 --> 01:49:34.772]  You know, it matters who accuses you.
[01:49:34.772 --> 01:49:38.053]  If it's a big corporation, they don't really have to prove anything.
[01:49:38.053 --> 01:49:46.535]  They can just accuse you, and just like civil asset forfeiture, they can shut you down without finding you guilty of anything, without giving you a day in court, without any due process.
[01:49:46.535 --> 01:49:48.736]  That's what's coming with all this copyright stuff.
[01:49:50.242 --> 01:49:54.125]  Yeah, and also we see that with them tying it into cyber security.
[01:49:54.125 --> 01:49:57.268]  You know, Stuxnet, Flame, you name it.
[01:49:57.268 --> 01:50:05.674]  All those big cyber security problems, those issues, were all contrived by either the US government, the Israeli government, or both of them in unison.
[01:50:05.674 --> 01:50:10.879]  And now they're exploiting the copyright issue to push the re-emergence of
[01:50:11.579 --> 01:50:13.940]  Legislation like SOPA and CISPA.
[01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:17.241]  I mean, look at what happened to Aaron Schwartz.
[01:50:17.241 --> 01:50:19.482]  He was made an example out of.
[01:50:19.482 --> 01:50:28.245]  He was, you know, completely demonized and obviously it led to his tragic suicide for uploading academic documents to the internet.
[01:50:28.245 --> 01:50:33.847]  Something which even if you believe he was in the wrong would have received a, you know, a fine or a light prison sentence.
[01:50:33.847 --> 01:50:35.428]  He was completely hounded.
[01:50:35.948 --> 01:50:38.671]  By the authorities which led to his suicide.
[01:50:38.671 --> 01:50:40.994]  So they're making examples out of people.
[01:50:40.994 --> 01:50:50.804]  They're using copyright to go after the small guy while claiming that they assert ownership over your material if you simply use their services.
[01:50:50.804 --> 01:50:52.686]  It's getting completely out of control.
[01:50:52.686 --> 01:50:55.730]  It's all about sharing and it's all about asserting their ownership.
[01:50:55.730 --> 01:50:56.070]  Stay with us.
[01:50:56.070 --> 01:50:57.852]  We're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:50:59.224 --> 01:51:03.348]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:03.348 --> 01:51:06.530]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:06.530 --> 01:51:08.152]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:08.152 --> 01:51:11.494]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:11.494 --> 01:51:13.016]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:51:13.016 --> 01:51:14.137]  Just won't quit.
[01:51:14.887 --> 01:51:17.231]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[01:51:17.231 --> 01:51:21.938]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?
[01:51:21.938 --> 01:51:23.701]  Get our 10 Reasons book free.

[01:51:30.461 --> 01:51:31.442]  Hey, Boomer!
[01:51:31.442 --> 01:51:34.903]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[01:51:34.903 --> 01:51:36.564]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[01:51:36.564 --> 01:51:38.504]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[01:51:38.504 --> 01:51:44.346]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[01:51:44.346 --> 01:51:45.187]  I know, right?
[01:51:45.187 --> 01:51:46.487]  You love it, too!
[01:51:46.487 --> 01:51:47.928]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[01:51:47.928 --> 01:51:48.968]  Let's go get some!
[01:51:48.968 --> 01:51:50.709]  Get Berkey Clean Water by calling 877-886-3653.
[01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:51.049]  That's 877-886-3653.

[01:51:59.392 --> 01:52:03.006]  Why use dial-up when you can use broadband?
[01:52:03.006 --> 01:52:04.010]  Why travel with this?
[01:52:05.071 --> 01:52:06.932]  When you can use this.
[01:52:06.932 --> 01:52:12.896]  And why would anyone use colloidal or ionic silver when you can use supernatural silver?
[01:52:12.896 --> 01:52:20.121]  Supernatural silver is state-of-the-art and it's been clinically proven to be several hundred times more effective than those other silvers.
[01:52:20.121 --> 01:52:26.066]  It's powerful enough to protect you and your family from the threat of deadly viruses, bacteria and fungus.
[01:52:26.066 --> 01:52:29.308]  But it's so safe that it can be used internally or topically.
[01:52:29.788 --> 01:52:34.469]  And you'll never again deal with the nasty side effects of harsh drugs or antibiotics.
[01:52:34.469 --> 01:52:44.991]  Hundreds of scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals, and research institutions have all shown Supernatural Silver is a powerful weapon in the fight against invading pathogens.
[01:52:44.991 --> 01:52:48.211]  Supernatural Silver is a must-have for your arsenal.

[01:53:44.613 --> 01:53:45.053]  Day after day
[01:54:09.893 --> 01:54:14.937]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:14.937 --> 01:54:17.600]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:18.841]  We're talking about how the
[01:54:19.767 --> 01:54:27.111]  Corporations are extending their copyrights in myriad ways to assert ownership over everything.
[01:54:27.111 --> 01:54:30.452]  And now we've got PayPal with a new user agreement.
[01:54:30.452 --> 01:54:38.416]  And of course, as Paul pointed out, Facebook once before came under a lot of criticism for putting out a new copyright statement.
[01:54:38.416 --> 01:54:42.578]  But they made it clear in their statement that you retained copyright to your content.
[01:54:42.578 --> 01:54:45.840]  This one from PayPal looks far more extensive.
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:47.861]  Very alarming language that's in there.
[01:54:47.861 --> 01:54:56.244]  I want to go back to Paul, but before we do, I just want to let you know that we have free shipping at Infowarslife.com on several products.
[01:54:56.244 --> 01:55:01.246]  On X2, on Supermail, on OxyPowder, and on Silver Bullet.
[01:55:01.246 --> 01:55:04.127]  We have free shipping at Infowarslife.com.
[01:55:04.127 --> 01:55:06.748]  And of course, we also have the special 50% off
[01:55:08.169 --> 01:55:08.710]  We're good to go.
[01:55:19.631 --> 01:55:22.353]  A great time to stock up on that.
[01:55:22.353 --> 01:55:24.674]  It's half off and free shipping.
[01:55:24.674 --> 01:55:26.695]  Also, we have another special.
[01:55:26.695 --> 01:55:35.321]  You can get a free bottle of Fluoride Shield when you stock up on two bottles of X2 nascent iodine or when you get two bottles of Silver Bullet.
[01:55:35.321 --> 01:55:39.363]  You can get a free bottle of Fluoride Shield along with free shipping.
[01:55:39.363 --> 01:55:41.425]  That's at Infowarslife.com.
[01:55:42.205 --> 01:55:43.846]  Let's go back to Paul again.
[01:55:43.846 --> 01:55:51.333]  Paul, we were just talking about how they have extended these copyrights and what is coming up with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[01:55:51.333 --> 01:55:55.636]  Of course, we have a fast track that was just passed last week.
[01:55:55.636 --> 01:55:58.538]  They're going to fast track the fast track negotiation.
[01:55:58.538 --> 01:56:01.141]  How are people reacting to this in the UK?
[01:56:04.278 --> 01:56:10.662]  TTIP has come up on a few occasions but there's definitely a media bias not to cover it.
[01:56:10.662 --> 01:56:16.325]  One of the fringe parties introduced it during a political debate last night I believe it was.
[01:56:16.325 --> 01:56:19.267]  Obviously we've got a general election coming up in the UK next month.
[01:56:19.987 --> 01:56:26.912]  And he accused, he's the head of the Reality Party, he accused the BBC of hiding it, not talking about it.
[01:56:26.912 --> 01:56:29.494]  And they of course claimed, oh yes, we did mention it.
[01:56:29.494 --> 01:56:30.935]  And they always do that.
[01:56:30.935 --> 01:56:33.576]  You know, they can claim, oh we mentioned it in this report.
[01:56:33.576 --> 01:56:39.160]  But there's a difference between mentioning it and actually giving it the coverage that it deserves.
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:45.805]  So there's definitely been a tendency, definitely in the UK, to sideline that entire issue.
[01:56:45.805 --> 01:56:46.085]  Because
[01:56:46.625 --> 01:56:53.489]  You know, they're part of the same team, but we don't even know what's in most of it, because they've classified it under national security.
[01:56:53.489 --> 01:57:01.574]  In fact, I think it was Elizabeth Warren who said, if people knew what was actually in this, they would go completely crazy.
[01:57:01.574 --> 01:57:04.896]  And that's part of the reason why they're keeping it classified, obviously.
[01:57:05.456 --> 01:57:07.117]  Yeah, she went to the White House.
[01:57:07.117 --> 01:57:16.823]  Some of the members of Congress were briefed on it because, you know, quite frankly, the Republican Party seems inexplicably to be 100% behind this because it's labeled as free trade.
[01:57:16.823 --> 01:57:19.545]  So therefore, you know, you're supposed to be for free markets.
[01:57:19.545 --> 01:57:21.186]  But this is not a free market.
[01:57:21.186 --> 01:57:24.008]  This is crony capitalism in its worst form.
[01:57:24.008 --> 01:57:27.290]  This is corporate fascism in its worst form.
[01:57:27.290 --> 01:57:28.851]  And a lot of people, I think,
[01:57:29.511 --> 01:57:29.691]  I think?
[01:57:59.411 --> 01:58:00.060]  It's a lot louder than that.
[01:58:01.232 --> 01:58:05.193]  Yeah, there's a huge difference between free market and corporatism.
[01:58:05.193 --> 01:58:05.433]  Yes.
[01:58:05.433 --> 01:58:07.493]  Which is what this TTIP is.
[01:58:07.493 --> 01:58:11.394]  It's allowing foreign corporations to change US laws.
[01:58:11.394 --> 01:58:14.674]  It's a complete violation of US sovereignty.
[01:58:14.674 --> 01:58:19.635]  And it's not going to help the vast majority of businesses in the United States.
[01:58:19.635 --> 01:58:21.636]  It's not going to help the middle class.
[01:58:21.636 --> 01:58:29.217]  It's only going to help the huge corporations that already get special favours from government, that have revolving doors with government,
[01:58:29.577 --> 01:58:32.801]  And as he said, it's the ultimate expression of crony capitalism.
[01:58:32.801 --> 01:58:36.385]  It has nothing whatsoever to do with the free market.
[01:58:36.385 --> 01:58:37.286]  Absolutely.
[01:58:37.286 --> 01:58:39.288]  Thank you for joining us.

[02:00:11.233 --> 02:00:12.794]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.794 --> 02:00:16.998]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.998 --> 02:00:21.061]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.615 --> 02:00:26.936]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:26.936 --> 02:00:28.157]  I'm David Knight.
[02:00:28.157 --> 02:00:32.340]  We're going to be joined in the next segment with John Rapoport.
[02:00:32.340 --> 02:00:43.269]  And before we go to him, because he's been a target of people for speaking out for informed consent, for your right to choose what goes into your food, to know about what goes into your food, and then to make that choice.
[02:00:43.269 --> 02:00:45.351]  To know what's going into your body.
[02:00:45.911 --> 02:00:48.435]  In terms of medicine and to be able to make that choice.
[02:00:48.435 --> 02:00:49.857]  He's spoken out for that.
[02:00:49.857 --> 02:00:56.185]  He's exposed the efforts to take that freedom, that information away from us and he's been attacked in the media.
[02:00:57.048 --> 02:01:01.851]  Before we go to John Rappaport, I want to talk about Dr. Oz who's been attacked in the media.
[02:01:01.851 --> 02:01:03.913]  This is a story that's up on Infowars.com.
[02:01:03.913 --> 02:01:08.416]  Dr. Oz's new episode ends controversy and doubles down on GMO labeling.
[02:01:08.416 --> 02:01:12.118]  This is a story from Jeffrey Jackson that's on Infowars.com.
[02:01:12.118 --> 02:01:26.788]  And this was Dr. Oz's response to a letter that was signed by 10 doctors asking the hospital that he works at to remove him from the hospital because they were not happy with what he talked about on his own show.
[02:01:28.309 --> 02:01:34.855]  And he came back and essentially went on the attack, exposing where these doctors were coming from.
[02:01:34.855 --> 02:01:40.739]  But before I talk about that, I want to talk about how he opened up his show to respond to this.
[02:01:41.786 --> 02:01:42.767]  This is what he said.
[02:01:42.767 --> 02:01:47.570]  He said, my life's work has been built around one simple message.
[02:01:47.570 --> 02:01:52.894]  You have a right and a responsibility to become the world expert on your own body.
[02:01:52.894 --> 02:01:55.236]  In other words, to be informed.
[02:01:55.236 --> 02:02:02.462]  To understand what, how your body works, what's being put into it in terms of your food, in terms of your medicine, to analyze it.
[02:02:02.462 --> 02:02:04.003]  So he's trying to educate people there.
[02:02:04.898 --> 02:02:16.843]  So you need to become a world expert on your own body, he said, and the way you do that is to have access to the best, most current information, to multiple points of view, and to diverse opinions.
[02:02:16.843 --> 02:02:21.525]  And as part of his show, he showed a clip that he had with somebody who was
[02:02:23.823 --> 02:02:30.446]  I guess we would call him a, he called him a manufacturer, I think, and I guess maybe that's a good word to talk about genetically modified organisms.
[02:02:30.446 --> 02:02:33.148]  It is more like manufacturing than growing.
[02:02:33.148 --> 02:02:47.536]  Nevertheless, he had a farmer on who had genetically modified apples that did not turn brown when you cut them, and so he talked to him about it, let the guy make the case, and he also talked to somebody who was concerned.
[02:02:48.036 --> 02:02:54.960]  about genetically modifying apples and understand the difference between genetic modification and selective breeding.
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:58.622]  Selective breeding has been going on as long as humans have been around.
[02:02:58.622 --> 02:03:08.387]  We've been looking at traits in a particular plant, in a particular animal and then trying to emphasize those traits by selective breeding.
[02:03:08.387 --> 02:03:14.150]  That's how we get the kinds of varieties of dogs that we see, for example, is by selective breeding.
[02:03:14.150 --> 02:03:15.691]  Genetic modification, however,
[02:03:17.032 --> 02:03:24.738]  We've been talking about copyright, so kind of think of this as going in and hacking God's code for living organisms.
[02:03:24.738 --> 02:03:25.459]  Think of it that way.
[02:03:26.325 --> 02:03:31.107]  Think about it as a copyright violation on what God has put in there.
[02:03:31.107 --> 02:03:38.509]  That's one way to look at it, but understand that when you're at that level, first of all, it's not very well understood, I believe.
[02:03:38.509 --> 02:03:43.751]  We see over and over again when they sequence the DNA of these different organisms, they'll talk about a lot of junk DNA.
[02:03:43.751 --> 02:03:48.913]  You see that used a lot when they're talking about sequencing DNA.
[02:03:48.913 --> 02:03:50.573]  I don't think there's junk DNA in there.
[02:03:50.573 --> 02:03:54.815]  I think there's DNA that they don't understand the functionality of, and they call it junk.
[02:03:55.782 --> 02:04:05.053]  And so that's what concerns me about this is that they're messing with things that they don't fully understand and they don't fully understand the repercussions of this and it's not being tested.
[02:04:05.053 --> 02:04:08.677]  But he also went on the offensive and I think this is very instructive as well.
[02:04:08.677 --> 02:04:11.160]  He had an investigative reporter, Elizabeth Limey,
[02:04:12.182 --> 02:04:16.465]  Who did a report, and she looked at all 10 of these doctors.
[02:04:16.465 --> 02:04:17.906]  And here's some examples.
[02:04:17.906 --> 02:04:30.314]  One of the primary attackers, Dr. Henry Miller, is clearly shown to be a biotech shill and a gun for hire, working previously as a key supporter for the tobacco industry in the 1990s.
[02:04:30.314 --> 02:04:36.458]  They also showed that one of the other attackers had an $8 million criminal Medicare fraud.
[02:04:36.458 --> 02:04:41.742]  Another organization was a rent-a-science group, the American Council of Science and Health.
[02:04:42.402 --> 02:04:48.125]  They've been promoting cigarettes, pesticides, and GMOs while they collect money from these industries.
[02:04:48.125 --> 02:04:56.510]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back with John Rapoport and we're going to talk about efforts to shut down and conceal what goes into your food.
[02:04:56.510 --> 02:04:56.810]  Stay with us.
[02:04:58.931 --> 02:05:10.559]  Beth Clarkson, Chief Statistician for the National Institute for Aviation Research, filed an open records lawsuit in Sedgwick County District Court as part of her personal quest to find an unexplained pattern that transcends elections and states.
[02:05:10.559 --> 02:05:17.004]  She found patterns and results that favored Republican establishment candidates over Tea Party candidates in primaries and in the general election.
[02:05:17.004 --> 02:05:19.886]  This is not an anomaly that has occurred in one place, Clarkson said.
[02:05:19.886 --> 02:05:23.128]  It is a pattern that has occurred repeatedly in elections across the United States.
[02:05:23.388 --> 02:05:27.551]  InfoWars has extensively covered the work of Bev Harris from blackboxvoting.org.
[02:05:27.551 --> 02:05:30.494]  There you can find the four key items to election transparency.
[02:05:30.494 --> 02:05:31.455]  One, who can vote.
[02:05:31.455 --> 02:05:32.415]  Two, who did vote.
[02:05:32.415 --> 02:05:33.616]  Three, counting of the vote.
[02:05:33.616 --> 02:05:35.218]  And four, the chain of custody.
[02:05:35.218 --> 02:05:40.582]  Now remember the words of computer programmer Clinton Eugene Curtis next time you step up to a touch screen to cast your ballot.
[02:05:40.582 --> 02:05:44.405]  I wrote a prototype for President Congressman Tom Feeney.
[02:05:44.605 --> 02:05:47.546]  What lies at the heart of InfoWars and everything we do?
[02:06:02.951 --> 02:06:10.735]  But the core is fellow human beings of every race, color, and creed across the United States and the planet that believe in personal liberty.
[02:06:10.735 --> 02:06:14.637]  And it's people like you that have promoted the radio broadcast to their friends and family.
[02:06:14.637 --> 02:06:21.040]  It's people like you that have bought the high-quality products at InfoWarsStore.com that have made everything we do possible.
[02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:22.961]  And that's why I want to salute you.
[02:06:22.961 --> 02:06:25.682]  You have helped us build this operation.
[02:06:25.682 --> 02:06:29.044]  You don't stand beside us or behind us or even in front of us.
[02:06:29.044 --> 02:06:31.145]  You stand at the heart of InfoWars.
[02:06:31.425 --> 02:06:40.492]  That's why in the month of April, we're offering some of the biggest specials yet to introduce listeners to these high quality nutraceuticals at InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:06:53.243 --> 02:06:55.685]  Free bottles of fluoride shield detoxer.

[02:07:01.934 --> 02:07:11.658]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:07:11.658 --> 02:07:14.359]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:07:14.359 --> 02:07:17.901]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:07:17.901 --> 02:07:24.243]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[02:07:24.243 --> 02:07:28.985]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:07:29.365 --> 02:07:35.748]  Working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[02:07:35.748 --> 02:07:43.490]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[02:07:43.490 --> 02:07:51.033]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[02:07:54.635 --> 02:07:57.576]  That's Child Ease exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:08:15.974 --> 02:08:24.538]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.538 --> 02:08:25.999]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:25.999 --> 02:08:32.022]  I'm David Knight, your host, and joining us now is John Rapoport from NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[02:08:32.022 --> 02:08:36.143]  In the last segment, I was talking about how the media has attacked Dr. Oz.
[02:08:38.157 --> 02:08:41.218]  Basically because he questioned GMO.
[02:08:41.218 --> 02:08:44.099]  And not even questioning its safety and efficacy.
[02:08:44.099 --> 02:08:47.140]  He had a very even-handed report.
[02:08:47.140 --> 02:08:50.281]  But he said, you have a right to know what goes into your food.
[02:08:50.281 --> 02:08:52.162]  You have a right to know about the labeling.
[02:08:52.162 --> 02:08:54.023]  But that's not the way things operate anymore.
[02:08:54.023 --> 02:08:59.685]  We see all over the country efforts to force people to take vaccines.
[02:09:00.643 --> 02:09:01.883]  Forget informed consent.
[02:09:01.883 --> 02:09:04.924]  They now call it a personal belief exemption.
[02:09:04.924 --> 02:09:06.925]  You're not informed, you just have a personal belief.
[02:09:06.925 --> 02:09:13.307]  You have an irrational faith that can't be substantiated by science, is what they claim.
[02:09:13.307 --> 02:09:21.510]  And when they talk about an exemption, that's kind of the difference between talking about a right and a privilege.
[02:09:21.510 --> 02:09:25.471]  You know, right is something you possess as a human being, something you're given from God.
[02:09:26.658 --> 02:09:31.616]  A privilege is something that you're granted from the government, and so they want to take away your consent.
[02:09:32.455 --> 02:09:33.736]  By calling it an exemption.
[02:09:33.736 --> 02:09:35.517]  We're not going to give you that exemption anymore.
[02:09:35.517 --> 02:09:37.879]  That's what we see all over the country.
[02:09:37.879 --> 02:09:42.883]  And I wanted to talk to John Rappaport about this article that was up on Wednesday at Infowars.com.
[02:09:42.883 --> 02:09:44.884]  Australia vaccine war update.
[02:09:44.884 --> 02:09:47.666]  The people are slaves to the state.
[02:09:47.666 --> 02:09:49.267]  Joining us now is John Rappaport.
[02:09:49.267 --> 02:09:50.468]  Welcome Mr. Rappaport.
[02:09:50.468 --> 02:09:51.949]  Hi, good to be here.
[02:09:51.949 --> 02:09:58.094]  Tell us about what's the efforts that are going on in Australia and I think also is it New Zealand where they're trying to do this as well?
[02:09:59.068 --> 02:10:06.751]  Yes, I've been getting a flood of responses from Australia after I published that.
[02:10:06.751 --> 02:10:25.258]  Basically what's happened there is that the government, head of government Tony Abbott, decided that he was going to make it severely penalizing for anybody who refuses the vaccine, for anyone who refuses to vaccinate a child.
[02:10:25.945 --> 02:10:33.130]  Because everybody in Australia gets some form of federal funding, money, whatever you want to call it.
[02:10:33.130 --> 02:10:35.891]  There are several different programs.
[02:10:35.891 --> 02:10:52.782]  And so, if a parent decides, okay, I'm not going to vaccinate my child, they would lose roughly $15,000 a year per child in federal aid for refusing to vaccinate.
[02:10:52.782 --> 02:10:53.583]  That's a stiff
[02:10:54.269 --> 02:10:54.409]  Wow.
[02:10:54.409 --> 02:10:54.489]  Wow.
[02:10:54.489 --> 02:10:56.190]  Yeah, again, it's an exemption.
[02:10:56.190 --> 02:10:57.771]  It's not getting your consent.
[02:11:24.241 --> 02:11:28.348]  The only thing that is now permitted is a medical note from a doctor
[02:11:39.702 --> 02:11:49.765]  Which basically says that you have some, you know, medical condition, serious medical condition, where a vaccine could be dangerous.
[02:11:49.765 --> 02:11:53.566]  And obviously that's not going to be an easy note to get from a doctor.
[02:11:53.566 --> 02:11:54.326]  That's right.
[02:11:54.326 --> 02:11:56.827]  Because these doctors are going to be under surveillance.
[02:11:56.827 --> 02:11:59.627]  Yeah, what's going to happen to that doctor when he gives somebody a note like that?
[02:11:59.627 --> 02:12:02.208]  He's going to come under a lot of examination.
[02:12:02.208 --> 02:12:03.348]  Oh, you bet.
[02:12:03.348 --> 02:12:08.970]  So they basically shut down all the loopholes in the country.
[02:12:09.497 --> 02:12:09.617]  Yeah.
[02:12:19.710 --> 02:12:22.513]  You know, they put the nation under medical police state.
[02:12:22.513 --> 02:12:24.175]  I mean, there's no other way to say it.
[02:12:24.175 --> 02:12:24.935]  Absolutely.
[02:12:24.935 --> 02:12:25.316]  Absolutely.
[02:12:25.316 --> 02:12:37.228]  You know, if you cannot know what's going into your body, if you can't know what's in your food, if you can't know what's in your medicine, and they're going to force you to take it, that is absolute tyranny.
[02:12:37.228 --> 02:12:39.450]  I know when they had this bill up in Oregon,
[02:12:40.421 --> 02:12:46.668]  I think it was Oregon or Washington State, it was a state senator who was also a physician who was pushing this.
[02:12:46.668 --> 02:12:49.110]  And they pointed out the hypocrisy of what she was doing.
[02:12:49.110 --> 02:12:56.398]  And they pointed out that she talked about, on a particular website, how she suffers from
[02:12:57.702 --> 02:13:01.423]  A particular disease and she wanted to keep taking interferon while she was breastfeeding.
[02:13:01.423 --> 02:13:07.645]  Both her physician and the drug company said you can't do that while you're breastfeeding.
[02:13:07.645 --> 02:13:08.886]  She did her own research.
[02:13:08.886 --> 02:13:15.688]  She called some medical professionals and she decided that she was going to do it anyway.
[02:13:15.688 --> 02:13:16.868]  So she did her research.
[02:13:16.868 --> 02:13:23.851]  She informed herself and she went against the recommendations of the doctor as well as the drug company and they said but you won't allow us
[02:13:24.611 --> 02:13:28.374]  To have that same choice, that same freedom with vaccines.
[02:13:28.374 --> 02:13:30.996]  That's what this really boils down to.
[02:13:30.996 --> 02:13:33.098]  And that's the principle that people need to understand.
[02:13:33.098 --> 02:13:38.963]  It's far beyond even the discussion about the safety and the efficacy of vaccines.
[02:13:38.963 --> 02:13:47.250]  When they can force you, put a gun to your head, and force you to take something without informing you, that is very, very dangerous.
[02:13:47.250 --> 02:13:48.831]  It is tyranny.
[02:13:48.831 --> 02:13:49.652]  You bet.
[02:13:49.652 --> 02:13:52.414]  And, you know, there are cases where
[02:13:53.582 --> 02:13:58.365]  You have to vaccinate your child or the child will be removed and taken to foster care.
[02:13:58.365 --> 02:14:00.266]  Well look at what's going on in California right now.
[02:14:00.266 --> 02:14:17.358]  They have this bill SB 277 and basically instead of coming through the subsidies like they did in Australia saying we're going to take you know a huge financial penalty that you're going to get there they're saying that you're not going to be allowed in school unless you can prove your vaccine record.
[02:14:18.118 --> 02:14:23.281]  But then it's not just taking your child out of the government school and putting them in a private school, they won't allow that either.
[02:14:23.281 --> 02:14:26.123]  And it's not even allowed for people who are homeschooling.
[02:14:26.123 --> 02:14:41.993]  Presumably, if you didn't have a vaccine record that was signed off by some bureaucrat with the state of California, even if you were homeschooling your child, presumably you would still be in violation of the truancy laws and I guess they could lock you up or take your children away.
[02:14:43.453 --> 02:15:08.457]  Yeah, so that's another medical police state that we're now seeing and of course they rigged that vote in the committee to pass it through to be voted on on the floor of the legislature in California by substituting a couple of members on the committee and also refusing to allow many parents who were up there in Sacramento protesting this whole thing to speak publicly in the second hearing that they held which was closed door
[02:15:09.415 --> 02:15:13.958]  And they voted to move the bill out onto the floor where it looks like it's going to pass.
[02:15:13.958 --> 02:15:17.660]  And of course, Jerry Brown, the governor, will sign it.
[02:15:17.660 --> 02:15:21.142]  So that is a shutdown in California.
[02:15:21.142 --> 02:15:23.304]  That's medical police state in California.
[02:15:23.304 --> 02:15:27.126]  This is happening all over the world.
[02:15:27.126 --> 02:15:28.727]  It's coordinated.
[02:15:28.727 --> 02:15:29.808]  It's timed.
[02:15:29.808 --> 02:15:33.230]  This is not just an accident that all of this is happening at once.
[02:15:33.875 --> 02:15:44.679]  And that in many states in America, we're now seeing these bills being presented to knock out all loopholes that would allow people not to get vaccinated.
[02:15:44.679 --> 02:15:56.224]  They started with this absurd outbreak of measles from Disneyland, which really was just, you know, a fairy tale from a fairy tale place.
[02:15:56.224 --> 02:16:00.606]  The whole country's in danger now because there's a few cases of measles and
[02:16:01.736 --> 02:16:09.579]  They tried to claim that all these kids who were getting measles were unvaccinated without any evidence presented.
[02:16:09.579 --> 02:16:21.564]  And all of a sudden, across the country, on news shows and talk shows and so forth, the experts began showing up and saying, OK, this is it.
[02:16:21.564 --> 02:16:23.465]  We have to vaccinate everybody.
[02:16:23.465 --> 02:16:24.705]  That's the consensus.
[02:16:24.705 --> 02:16:26.506]  Everybody agrees.
[02:16:26.506 --> 02:16:28.887]  They were just manufacturing the consensus.
[02:16:29.904 --> 02:16:36.487]  And a full-bore attack worldwide was then launched in a very coordinated way.
[02:16:36.487 --> 02:16:40.869]  So they were waiting for the right moment and they chose it and that's what they're doing now.
[02:16:41.525 --> 02:16:56.131]  I think it's very important when we look at the shenanigans that were played in the California Senate to understand that people who don't respect you enough as a human being, who don't respect the fundamental principles of liberty, of informed consent, of course they're not going to respect the due process of law.
[02:16:56.131 --> 02:16:58.992]  They're not going to have a fair and honest vote and a hearing.
[02:16:58.992 --> 02:17:01.313]  They're going to play every kind of game that they can.
[02:17:01.313 --> 02:17:03.574]  And we need to understand this isn't just a California problem.
[02:17:03.914 --> 02:17:05.676]  This isn't just an American problem.
[02:17:05.676 --> 02:17:12.962]  As you pointed out with your article talking about what's going on in Australia and New Zealand everywhere, this is a global issue.
[02:17:12.962 --> 02:17:19.667]  This is something that they're making this move all at once across the globe to try to force people to take vaccines.
[02:17:19.667 --> 02:17:21.509]  Clearly in the United States we can see that
[02:17:22.418 --> 02:17:27.661]  There's a huge financial incentive for the pharmaceutical companies to move things to vaccines.
[02:17:27.661 --> 02:17:32.844]  They announced a year or two ago they were going to stop working on antibiotics and they were going to put all their research on the vaccines.
[02:17:32.844 --> 02:17:39.368]  Well, we understand that they don't have any product liability in America because we have this thing called the vaccine court.
[02:17:39.368 --> 02:17:43.830]  That and the coercion ought to tell people something is up with all of this.
[02:17:43.830 --> 02:17:46.072]  But the other thing I'm worried about, John, is
[02:17:46.992 --> 02:17:54.721]  This massive effort in terms of vaccines, talking about how they're going to create vaccines with genetic modification.
[02:17:54.721 --> 02:18:01.429]  When you look at that and the vaccines that they are producing for pretty much every kind of disease, whether it's something like
[02:18:02.770 --> 02:18:29.769]  HPV or whether it's Ebola whatever they're they're coming up with genetically engineered vaccines and when you combine that with the fact that we would be forced to take them that is a very concerning scenario especially when you look at the medical research that's being done by Tulane and others with the gain-of-function experiments where they bring in deadly bacteria that are not indigenous to the area and then they try to make them more resistant to drugs try to make them more easily transmittable
[02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.911]  You bet.
[02:18:31.911 --> 02:18:43.743]  The genetically modified vaccines are, you know, this is just a wild roulette game.
[02:18:45.834 --> 02:18:48.095]  Many of these vaccines are being engineered.
[02:18:48.095 --> 02:18:54.017]  The genetic components that they're inserting have to be carried into the body.
[02:18:54.017 --> 02:18:56.238]  And they've been working, how do we get these into the body?
[02:18:56.238 --> 02:18:57.118]  How do we get these?
[02:18:57.118 --> 02:19:05.942]  And so many of the researchers have settled on this method of using a virus as the carrier for the genetic components.
[02:19:05.942 --> 02:19:09.063]  And of course, they claim that this is harmless and so forth.
[02:19:09.063 --> 02:19:14.965]  But when you inject somebody and bypass many portals of the immune system with a virus,
[02:19:15.788 --> 02:19:26.078]  You know, this is a danger sign of enormous size, because that virus can go anywhere, do anything, be transmitted from person to person.
[02:19:26.078 --> 02:19:28.080]  All sorts of things can happen.
[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:32.204]  Although they say nothing to worry about, they've always been saying that.
[02:19:32.204 --> 02:19:39.411]  And the facts show that these vaccines, just the conventional vaccines, are highly dangerous.
[02:19:39.833 --> 02:19:40.574]  Absolutely.
[02:19:40.574 --> 02:19:41.814]  We've got to go to a break.
[02:19:41.814 --> 02:19:53.903]  When we come back, I want to talk to you about some of these gain-of-function experiments, what happened with Tulane University at the Primate Center, as well as what you covered in Sierra Leone at the beginning of the Ebola outbreak.
[02:19:53.903 --> 02:19:54.244]  Stay with us.
[02:19:54.244 --> 02:19:56.105]  We're going to be right back with John Rappaport.

[02:20:58.646 --> 02:20:59.767]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:59.767 --> 02:21:07.794]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds, I lifted weights five days a week, I could swim two, three miles.
[02:21:07.794 --> 02:21:10.957]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[02:21:10.957 --> 02:21:12.919]  I started an access television show.
[02:21:12.919 --> 02:21:18.304]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[02:21:18.304 --> 02:21:21.167]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[02:21:21.667 --> 02:21:27.750]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut.
[02:21:27.750 --> 02:21:32.992]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[02:21:32.992 --> 02:21:37.874]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[02:21:38.154 --> 02:21:45.580]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Groot for InfoWarsLife.com, the results were incredible.
[02:21:45.580 --> 02:21:50.903]  Take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call.

[02:21:58.908 --> 02:21:59.928]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:21:59.928 --> 02:22:05.451]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:22:05.451 --> 02:22:06.011]  I get it.
[02:22:06.011 --> 02:22:15.595]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:22:15.595 --> 02:22:16.975]  That's not what's happening.
[02:22:16.975 --> 02:22:25.439]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:22:25.439 --> 02:22:28.680]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:22:28.820 --> 02:22:33.062]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:22:33.062 --> 02:22:34.662]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:22:34.662 --> 02:22:38.604]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:22:38.604 --> 02:22:42.405]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:22:42.405 --> 02:22:43.305]  You should, too.
[02:22:43.305 --> 02:22:44.446]  Find out what they know.

[02:22:48.147 --> 02:22:48.327]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:57.779 --> 02:23:00.400]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.

[02:23:54.461 --> 02:23:56.682]  There is only one silver solution.
[02:24:11.388 --> 02:24:12.670]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:12.670 --> 02:24:13.991]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[02:24:13.991 --> 02:24:17.915]  And joining us now is John Rappaport for one more segment.
[02:24:17.915 --> 02:24:19.797]  He is with nomorefakenews.com.
[02:24:19.797 --> 02:24:22.160]  That's where you can find his comments.
[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:27.806]  We were just talking about the efforts to coerce us to take away our consent.
[02:24:28.988 --> 02:24:35.949]  But to not let us be informed about what is going on in our food, what is being done to us with medication.
[02:24:35.949 --> 02:24:39.830]  And of course, when the Ebola outbreak came out, I thought it was very interesting.
[02:24:39.830 --> 02:24:50.092]  John Rapoport pointed out that Tulane University was doing experiments about the time this broke out in Sierra Leone with a lab there.
[02:24:50.092 --> 02:24:52.952]  The Sierra Leone government told them to get out.
[02:24:52.952 --> 02:24:55.713]  They were concerned that perhaps that was the source of this outbreak.
[02:24:56.874 --> 02:25:03.284]  By its qualitative nature is far, far worse by many orders of magnitude of any Ebola outbreak that has happened before.
[02:25:03.284 --> 02:25:05.827]  They were concerned that perhaps they had created some kind of a...
[02:25:07.185 --> 02:25:20.415]  New dangerous strain that maybe it had gotten out deliberately or even accidentally and everybody pooh-poohed that and laughed at that and yet we have now seen that is precisely what happened with the same people with Tulane in Louisiana.
[02:25:20.415 --> 02:25:28.861]  They brought in a bacteria, it's Burkholderia pseudomallei, they brought it into the United States, it's not indigenous to the area.
[02:25:28.861 --> 02:25:33.365]  It's part of these gain-of-function experiments where they bring in deadly bacteria
[02:25:33.925 --> 02:25:42.970]  They try to make them more dangerous, harder to kill, easier to spread, at the same time working on a vaccine.
[02:25:42.970 --> 02:25:44.770]  Doesn't that raise some red flags?
[02:25:44.770 --> 02:25:53.155]  And what happened in Louisiana was that Burkholderia pseudomallei got out of the primate lab, got out of a biosafety lab, level 3 lab,
[02:25:53.775 --> 02:25:58.262]  ...and got into the primate center into a 500 acre facility.
[02:25:58.262 --> 02:26:02.127]  They've had the USDA, the FDA down there trying to find out how this got out.
[02:26:02.127 --> 02:26:05.673]  They've had one person contract the disease herself.
[02:26:05.673 --> 02:26:07.976]  Of course, they said, well, I'm sure that was already there.
[02:26:08.956 --> 02:26:22.742]  I'm sure she didn't get that here, even to the absurd point of saying that if you find it anywhere in the soil, I'm sure it was already here, whereas you've got the CDC scientists saying this has never been indigenous to the United States.
[02:26:22.742 --> 02:26:26.604]  John, your comments on out-of-control biotech.
[02:26:26.604 --> 02:26:33.027]  Why do we have the government and pharmaceutical companies trying to make things more dangerous?
[02:26:34.363 --> 02:26:41.529]  You know, there's a tremendous crossover between so-called disease research and biological warfare research.
[02:26:41.529 --> 02:26:43.111]  It's a cover story.
[02:26:43.111 --> 02:26:55.481]  They need to have a way of saying, well, we're not really doing research on a bio warfare, offensive warfare, because we've already signed a treaty long ago forbidding us and many other countries from doing that.
[02:26:55.481 --> 02:26:57.223]  But we are, of course,
[02:26:57.898 --> 02:27:05.705]  You know, doing defensive research and pharmaceutical and disease research because we want to help people and cure them and so forth.
[02:27:05.705 --> 02:27:07.727]  And this is what they always say.
[02:27:07.727 --> 02:27:12.391]  As far back as 1987, when I was writing my first book, AIDS Inc.,
[02:27:13.217 --> 02:27:33.162]  I came across a great deal of information about the lack of safety in the so-called Level 3, 4, 5, 6 viral labs where they do all kinds of sophisticated research and combining germs and creating new germs and synthesizing this and that.
[02:27:34.090 --> 02:27:38.453]  The escape of microorganisms happens all the time.
[02:27:38.453 --> 02:27:47.019]  The transmission of these microorganisms happens all the time because of the human factor, regardless of whatever they say.
[02:27:47.019 --> 02:27:56.665]  So this is an entire apparatus and industry, I mean, in the United States and another country, of this kind of research at these labs.
[02:27:56.665 --> 02:28:01.209]  And they have problems all the time that do not reach the press.
[02:28:01.209 --> 02:28:01.769]  It happens.
[02:28:02.578 --> 02:28:04.420]  And it's a very dangerous thing.
[02:28:04.420 --> 02:28:08.025]  So when they try to say, well, we know exactly what we're doing.
[02:28:08.025 --> 02:28:11.629]  We're creating a great vaccine that's going to help everybody.
[02:28:11.629 --> 02:28:12.330]  Watch out.
[02:28:12.330 --> 02:28:13.111]  That's all I can say.
[02:28:13.740 --> 02:28:32.515]  Yeah it's very interesting because when this happened in Louisiana there was really only one reporter covering this very closely and that was a USA Today reporter who basically was on top of this story as it was developing and of course she has reported in the past on a lot of accidents that have happened at these
[02:28:33.596 --> 02:28:37.739]  So-called secure biosafety labs, even at the CDC itself.
[02:28:37.739 --> 02:28:39.540]  They've had a lot of accidents there.
[02:28:39.540 --> 02:28:45.124]  I guess that's the thing that really concerns me, and it concerns a lot of other people, yet nothing is being done about it, John.
[02:28:45.124 --> 02:28:51.588]  We just had the Congress last fall say they wanted to have a moratorium, a voluntary moratorium on these experiments.
[02:28:51.588 --> 02:28:55.350]  Well, that didn't go too far, because these people are making too much money out of it.
[02:28:55.350 --> 02:29:01.094]  It's one more head of the Hydra, one more aspect of the military-industrial complex, as you pointed out.
[02:29:01.714 --> 02:29:04.856]  And that, in and of itself, ought to concern us.
[02:29:04.856 --> 02:29:10.738]  But again, going back to the whole idea that we have absolutely no choice in the medicine that we get.
[02:29:10.738 --> 02:29:13.280]  We're not allowed to know what's in the food that we eat.
[02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:18.002]  They're hiding everything from us and holding a gun to our head in every single aspect of this.
[02:29:19.480 --> 02:29:23.844]  It's a war of our freedom versus their version of slavery.
[02:29:23.844 --> 02:29:24.124]  Yes.
[02:29:24.124 --> 02:29:25.626]  People have to understand that.
[02:29:25.626 --> 02:29:27.747]  This is the war that we're in.
[02:29:27.747 --> 02:29:28.248]  Absolutely.
[02:29:28.248 --> 02:29:30.230]  So, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:29:30.230 --> 02:29:33.032]  John Rapoport, NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[02:29:33.032 --> 02:29:33.833]  Stay with us.
[02:29:33.833 --> 02:29:34.574]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:48.204 --> 02:29:52.128]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.128 --> 02:29:54.811]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.016 --> 02:30:09.028]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[02:30:09.028 --> 02:30:10.950]  It's the illusion of choice.
[02:30:10.950 --> 02:30:11.711]  Think about it.
[02:30:11.711 --> 02:30:17.738]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[02:30:17.738 --> 02:30:18.639]  But on the other hand,
[02:30:19.079 --> 02:30:23.603]  The Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[02:30:23.603 --> 02:30:35.713]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[02:30:35.713 --> 02:30:38.695]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[02:30:38.695 --> 02:30:41.477]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[02:30:41.477 --> 02:30:46.361]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[02:30:46.361 --> 02:30:46.922]  Think about it.
[02:30:47.142 --> 02:30:59.327]  This is Darren McBreen and I want you to break the matrix at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and listen to the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on in your mind.
[02:30:59.327 --> 02:31:00.427]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:31:00.427 --> 02:31:04.669]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds.
[02:31:04.669 --> 02:31:06.350]  I lift weights five days a week.
[02:31:06.790 --> 02:31:08.451]  I could swim two, three miles.
[02:31:08.451 --> 02:31:11.612]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[02:31:11.612 --> 02:31:13.573]  I started an access television show.
[02:31:13.573 --> 02:31:18.955]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[02:31:18.955 --> 02:31:22.336]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[02:31:22.336 --> 02:31:28.399]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut.
[02:31:28.399 --> 02:31:32.501]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds
[02:31:33.641 --> 02:31:38.824]  I started taking Super Mel Vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[02:31:38.824 --> 02:31:46.228]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Group for InfoWarsLife.com, the results were incredible.
[02:31:46.228 --> 02:31:51.551]  Take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call.
[02:31:51.551 --> 02:31:54.532]  They can answer all your questions or tell you about any of the specials at 888-253-3139.
[02:32:00.183 --> 02:32:01.525]  In the near future.
[02:32:01.525 --> 02:32:05.190]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:32:05.190 --> 02:32:06.032]  Security alert.
[02:32:06.032 --> 02:32:07.253]  Security alert.
[02:32:07.253 --> 02:32:09.256]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:32:09.256 --> 02:32:12.861]  Analysis, InfoWars, building, independent media operation.
[02:32:12.861 --> 02:32:15.364]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that...
[02:32:15.725 --> 02:32:17.827]  We are the ones responsible.
[02:32:17.827 --> 02:32:20.389]  Crime directive discredit Alex Jones.
[02:32:20.389 --> 02:32:23.271]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:32:23.271 --> 02:32:26.514]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:32:26.514 --> 02:32:28.816]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:32:28.816 --> 02:32:30.358]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:32:30.358 --> 02:32:33.160]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:32:33.160 --> 02:32:35.122]  They're never going to stop.
[02:32:35.122 --> 02:32:39.165]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:32:39.165 --> 02:32:41.967]  Block free iPhone ads at InfoWars.com.
[02:32:42.768 --> 02:32:51.835]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:32:51.835 --> 02:32:53.397]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[02:32:53.397 --> 02:32:54.517]  You can feel it.
[02:33:07.310 --> 02:33:10.851]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:10.851 --> 02:33:18.913]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:18.913 --> 02:33:20.833]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:20.833 --> 02:33:27.055]  I'm David Knight and we're going to be talking to Anthony Gucciardi here in just a moment about what's going on with GMO.
[02:33:27.055 --> 02:33:34.537]  Of course, we've had victories in Vermont where the state legislature there has a mandatory GMO labeling.
[02:33:34.537 --> 02:33:35.777]  You know, you have a right to know
[02:33:36.417 --> 02:33:39.258]  You should be informed about what is going into your food.
[02:33:39.258 --> 02:33:52.480]  And of course, as I mentioned at the beginning of the hour, Dr. Oz came back and he said, I think the reason they came after me was because I dared to even have a discussion from one person who was in favor of GMO and another person who had criticism of it.
[02:33:52.480 --> 02:33:56.381]  He had an even discussion of that, but even that is not allowed.
[02:33:56.381 --> 02:33:57.141]  So they came after him.
[02:33:57.141 --> 02:33:59.442]  And of course, they are now moving to the
[02:34:00.262 --> 02:34:01.283]  Federal level.
[02:34:01.283 --> 02:34:05.185]  They've come up about the time that these attacks came on him.
[02:34:05.185 --> 02:34:15.292]  It was also put at the, in the federal government we had legislation introduced that critics have called the Dark Act, denying Americans the right to know.
[02:34:15.292 --> 02:34:17.674]  The Dark Act, which would basically preempt
[02:34:18.374 --> 02:34:22.138]  States from having the ability to do their own labeling laws.
[02:34:22.138 --> 02:34:26.982]  And of course that's the status, that's the way it's been done for a very long time, where states were involved with labeling laws.
[02:34:26.982 --> 02:34:29.925]  But of course, issues like this Vermont...
[02:34:30.979 --> 02:34:31.660]  I don't think so.
[02:34:49.130 --> 02:34:56.673]  If you want to call in and tell us where you think this is going to go, what you think about your right to know, your right to have informed consent, we'll take your calls at 800-259-9231.
[02:34:56.673 --> 02:35:01.275]  We're going to talk to Anthony Gucciardi.
[02:35:01.275 --> 02:35:04.276]  He'll take your comments and calls as well with me.
[02:35:04.756 --> 02:35:10.218]  Before we do, before I go to Anthony, I just want to let you know we have free shipping now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:35:10.218 --> 02:35:16.501]  We have free shipping on X2, on Supermail, on OxyPowder, and on Silver Bullet.

[02:35:21.503 --> 02:35:25.765]  We also have a massive sale on Silver Bullet, 50% off.
[02:35:25.765 --> 02:35:28.206]  We've never had this much of a discount on Silver Bullet.
[02:35:28.926 --> 02:35:35.951]  Right now you can save $15 per bottle, 50% off the usual price, and of course this is our 30 parts per million.

[02:35:43.776 --> 02:35:48.098]  It'll improve the potency and you can store this in your preparedness pack for years.
[02:35:48.979 --> 02:35:57.906]  We sell out of this frequently, but right now it is in stock and you can also get free shipping with that as well as 50% off and $15 per bottle off.
[02:35:57.906 --> 02:36:00.888]  It's a great sale right now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:36:02.711 --> 02:36:03.992]  Anthony, thank you for joining us.
[02:36:03.992 --> 02:36:10.459]  This is a real fight that is shaping up in terms of it's essentially a right of freedom.
[02:36:10.459 --> 02:36:13.842]  It's a right to not be treated like lab rats.
[02:36:13.842 --> 02:36:20.348]  To have human dignity and freedom to know what's in our food, know what's in our medicine, and make those choices for ourselves.
[02:36:20.348 --> 02:36:22.791]  And they're trying to take this away at every level right now.
[02:36:23.331 --> 02:36:26.875]  Quite frankly, it's a right that Monsanto does not want you to have.
[02:36:26.875 --> 02:36:29.218]  We actually have proof of that from Reuters.
[02:36:29.218 --> 02:36:38.549]  A piece that we can pull up on screen specifically lists that 96% in a poll of Monsanto shareholders would actually vote against GMO labeling.
[02:36:39.570 --> 02:36:41.191]  Why do you think that is?
[02:36:41.191 --> 02:36:47.073]  Obviously, it's because they know the public will not buy their garbage if they know what they're actually eating.
[02:36:47.073 --> 02:36:50.395]  If they know they're eating genetically modified organisms.
[02:36:50.395 --> 02:37:04.301]  So, at the end of the day, we know more than 95%, and we also have those polls too, from the New York Times, MSNBC, Washington Post, Reuters, you name it, Consumer Reports, we see time and time again, 95%.
[02:37:05.901 --> 02:37:11.185]  98% are in support from the general public of the United States in support of GMO labeling.
[02:37:11.185 --> 02:37:19.170]  That's why now so many states have come from Texas to Minnesota, now Vermont, passing mandatory labeling.
[02:37:19.170 --> 02:37:21.512]  The Attorney General just signed off on that one.
[02:37:21.512 --> 02:37:35.041]  A great, great victory because previously they had actually legislation for the labeling that was considered relaxed and they gave some timetables that were a little ridiculous for companies to go ahead and label their GMOs, but now they say, nope, mandatory labeling.
[02:37:35.701 --> 02:37:43.705]  This scares major biotech industries like Monsanto, like DuPont into absolutely freaking out, and that's when we have what you mentioned, the DARK Act.
[02:37:43.705 --> 02:37:49.688]  The pro-GMO DARK Act, which basically disallows the labeling of GMO foods.
[02:37:49.688 --> 02:37:51.989]  It disallows you from knowing what you're eating.
[02:37:51.989 --> 02:37:53.270]  It hides it, yeah, exactly.
[02:37:53.270 --> 02:37:55.771]  It's like the Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[02:37:55.771 --> 02:37:58.533]  They say, if people knew what was in it, they wouldn't want this.
[02:37:59.053 --> 02:38:00.875]  And the same thing is true of your food.
[02:38:00.875 --> 02:38:01.956]  Why are they hiding this?
[02:38:01.956 --> 02:38:04.919]  That, in and of itself, should be a major red flag.
[02:38:04.919 --> 02:38:13.168]  That everything that the government is doing anymore, they're hiding what's in it, and they're holding a gun to your head saying, you have to do this because I say so, and you don't have any choice in the matter.
[02:38:13.168 --> 02:38:17.873]  People ought to stand up and demand to be informed, demand to have a right.
[02:38:18.513 --> 02:38:27.458]  In Minnesota, so my favorite, my personal favorite state right now pushing for GMO legislation, one of the first to introduce it in 2015, is Minnesota.
[02:38:27.458 --> 02:38:34.821]  And we now have reports from the local news that people are going to the courthouse, storming the courthouse, screaming that they want GMO labeling.
[02:38:34.821 --> 02:38:45.467]  The local stores, these little independent local grocery stores, are getting letters and people coming in, swarming in, saying we want you to label your GMOs independently, slapping their own GMO labeling stickers on the food.
[02:38:45.467 --> 02:38:47.008]  And here this is from Minnesota.
[02:38:47.648 --> 02:38:47.888]  Right?
[02:38:47.888 --> 02:38:50.089]  The most unlikely state possible.
[02:38:50.089 --> 02:39:15.460]  But just as we saw with Vermont, just one state pushing on the legislation, with us actually as activists and as researchers and as intellectual thinkers pushing it forward and forward and forward, we can attain the victory over Monsanto, even though they are actually the ones that falsified, through a subgroup, they used an FDA quote for Prop 37, which was California's labeling initiative, that said GMOs are perfectly safe and natural.
[02:39:15.460 --> 02:39:17.181]  And they used the FDA logo on it.
[02:39:17.461 --> 02:39:17.741]  Yeah.
[02:39:17.741 --> 02:39:26.224]  And this is one of their many, many dirty tricks that they use time and time and time again to defeat this labeling legislation, because they know that they can't actually argue the facts.
[02:39:26.224 --> 02:39:32.906]  That's why they have armies of trolls, as we talked about yesterday, entire departments paid to go online and discredit scientists.
[02:39:32.906 --> 02:39:39.728]  So, as a matter of fact, they're losing the battle and they know it, and this is just further proof with the DARK Act that we must now stop.
[02:39:39.728 --> 02:39:41.469]  It's very concerning to see this.
[02:39:42.729 --> 02:39:57.875]  In Hawaii, this last election, they had a ballot initiative where the farmers in one area said, you're trespassing onto our organic farms, onto our heirloom products here with your genetically modified organisms, Monsanto, that you're farming.
[02:39:57.875 --> 02:40:00.996]  So they shut that down as part of a referendum.
[02:40:00.996 --> 02:40:04.117]  Now they're using a federal judge to basically overrule that.
[02:40:05.698 --> 02:40:10.262]  Movements within the states, like Minnesota and Vermont, it's already passed to try to shut it down at the state level.
[02:40:10.262 --> 02:40:11.002]  So now what do they do?
[02:40:11.002 --> 02:40:14.345]  They take it to the Congress and try to run this act through.
[02:40:14.345 --> 02:40:23.192]  This is something from a Kansas Republican, Representative Mike Pompeo, who is trying to ram this through to keep this all secret because they know people don't want to see it.
[02:40:24.132 --> 02:40:24.653]  Don't want it.
[02:40:24.653 --> 02:40:29.058]  And yet we see the same thing is happening with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Transatlantic Partnership.
[02:40:29.058 --> 02:40:36.967]  If they can't get it shut down at the federal level, they keep going up higher and higher up the pyramid because they have to buy off fewer and fewer people if they do that.
[02:40:36.967 --> 02:40:39.469]  So now they're going to do it at the global level as well.
[02:40:39.469 --> 02:40:41.452]  We've got to fight this battle at every single level.
[02:40:41.812 --> 02:40:46.917]  We've heard from farmers time and time again about GMO contamination, how it's ruining their life.
[02:40:46.917 --> 02:40:56.226]  They're actually going bankrupt because what happens is they test all of the organic USDA organic crops and the produce and everything like that before they ship it out for market, right?
[02:40:56.226 --> 02:41:00.431]  So if you're an organic farmer and your next-door neighbor is a Monsanto GMO farmer,
[02:41:00.991 --> 02:41:02.633]  Using Roundup and garbage like that.
[02:41:02.633 --> 02:41:06.536]  If some of his GMO seeds contaminate your field systems, which is very likely.
[02:41:06.536 --> 02:41:12.021]  In fact, I've heard reports of trucks going around with GMO seeds dousing it on the organic fields.
[02:41:12.021 --> 02:41:14.523]  And apparently there's video of that too that's coming out.
[02:41:14.523 --> 02:41:21.990]  Anyway, then they get tested and there's GMO contamination in the organic crops and it's rejected by the USDA in many cases if they're doing their job.
[02:41:22.350 --> 02:41:33.935]  So the independent farmer then gets rejected and has to sell either as GMO or conventional because he has a small 0.01% contamination amount in his organic crop and he is sent out of business.
[02:41:33.935 --> 02:41:43.319]  And then flip side, even the GMO farmers like the ones in India, they go over in India, these independent poor farmers, and they sell them contracts with Monsanto based
[02:41:43.319 --> 02:41:43.379]  Yes.
[02:42:09.750 --> 02:42:14.494]  The same thing we see happening even with John Deere coming in and saying, you don't own your tractors anymore.
[02:42:14.494 --> 02:42:15.956]  That's what they're doing to the farmers in India.
[02:42:15.956 --> 02:42:20.720]  They come in, they hook them on this genetically modified, these crops.
[02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:22.001]  These guys can't make any money.
[02:42:22.001 --> 02:42:23.883]  They're no longer operating for themselves anymore.
[02:42:23.883 --> 02:42:25.084]  They no longer own anything.
[02:42:25.084 --> 02:42:26.025]  That's the issue.
[02:42:26.605 --> 02:42:36.196]  And just as we saw with these cross-contamination of crops, I went before the Supreme Court, and of course the Supreme Court said, no, it's not a trespass, which is the way I would look at it.
[02:42:36.196 --> 02:42:42.162]  They say, no, these people are stealing the copyrighted GMO organisms from Monsanto.
[02:42:42.162 --> 02:42:42.783]  That's the way they did it.
[02:42:42.783 --> 02:42:45.045]  But of course, remember that Clarence Thomas
[02:42:45.726 --> 02:42:45.906]  Yeah.
[02:42:45.906 --> 02:42:46.507]  Hi, how are you today?
[02:42:46.507 --> 02:42:47.107]  Doing good.
[02:42:47.107 --> 02:42:50.210]  You know, Alex Jones once said, what would it take for you to get involved in this fight?
[02:43:13.718 --> 02:43:19.704]  And in Vermont, that happened today.
[02:43:19.704 --> 02:43:28.853]  Vermont legislature is very close to passing or removing the philosophical exemption for vaccines.
[02:43:29.961 --> 02:43:49.021]  And the Senate approved of it 18 to 11, and I asked, you know, what senators actually voted for and against it, and it was a division call, which means that it was just a ney and yay.
[02:43:49.021 --> 02:43:51.564]  It wasn't an individual vote.
[02:43:53.118 --> 02:43:58.025]  So I can't even find out who voted for it and who voted against it.
[02:43:58.025 --> 02:43:59.326]  Yeah, they hide that.
[02:43:59.326 --> 02:44:01.269]  Let me ask you this, Ron, because I think it's very interesting.
[02:44:01.269 --> 02:44:04.774]  We were just talking about how Vermont became the first state to have mandatory GMO labeling.
[02:44:04.774 --> 02:44:08.458]  And of course, the idea behind that is that you should know what's going into your food.
[02:44:09.019 --> 02:44:23.673]  And yet when it comes to vaccines, you'll see many of the people, a lot of them will be in the Democrat Party, they would fight for GMO labeling, and yet they would fight to mandate that you have no right to be informed or have consent about what goes into injections.
[02:44:23.673 --> 02:44:29.459]  I mean, how do you explain that kind of doublethink?
[02:44:29.459 --> 02:44:30.500]  Is the way I would characterize it.
[02:44:31.514 --> 02:44:33.575]  It's, I'm terrified of this.
[02:44:33.575 --> 02:44:37.036]  Because, you know, what will happen next?
[02:44:37.036 --> 02:44:43.977]  Will they start mandating, once they have a mandate on vaccines, then will they say, you know what?
[02:44:43.977 --> 02:44:54.120]  You are, these people who are mentally ill, now we have a mood altering vaccine and you will be forced to take that.
[02:44:54.120 --> 02:44:59.222]  I mean, this goes, this is very Orwellian and scares the hell out of me.
[02:44:59.222 --> 02:44:59.802]  Absolutely.
[02:45:01.062 --> 02:45:04.963]  We really need to, you know, put the stake in the ground.
[02:45:04.963 --> 02:45:07.004]  For me, this is it.
[02:45:07.004 --> 02:45:15.207]  I'm ready to get my signs out, stand on, you know, some of the biggest street corners, and start, you know,
[02:45:16.579 --> 02:45:20.763]  Get my bullhorn out, because this is very scary.
[02:45:20.763 --> 02:45:35.478]  I have a relative who was in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany, and she was interviewed by the director for Schindler's List to make that movie.
[02:45:38.372 --> 02:45:43.977]  What we are seeing are the same things that were happening then.
[02:45:43.977 --> 02:45:46.339]  It's more dangerous now.
[02:45:46.339 --> 02:45:47.479]  Incredible.
[02:45:47.479 --> 02:45:56.967]  When they looked at the abuses that happened, of course those abuses were being done by Joseph Mingala and others, saying that, yeah, we're doing these horrific experiments, but it's for the greater good of humanity.
[02:45:56.967 --> 02:46:05.294]  Because what we learned by torturing and killing these people, we will use that to produce better products down the line to help other people's health.
[02:46:05.874 --> 02:46:14.859]  And so, at the Nuremberg trials, they came up with the Nuremberg Code, and they said it is absolutely essential that you retain informed consent in order to keep this type of thing from happening.
[02:46:14.859 --> 02:46:20.743]  But that's now precisely what they're trying to destroy throughout the United States, and it's also a global effort.
[02:46:20.743 --> 02:46:22.023]  Your comments, Anthony.
[02:46:22.023 --> 02:46:25.365]  We are in an abusive relationship with our government.
[02:46:25.365 --> 02:46:28.087]  We're in an abusive relationship with our food supply.
[02:46:28.547 --> 02:46:32.709]  What that means is we keep bringing it upon ourselves over and over and over again.
[02:46:32.709 --> 02:46:40.734]  Just because we are continually supporting people like Hillary Clinton, who openly supported Monsanto in an interview.
[02:46:40.734 --> 02:46:42.955]  It was in 2013, one of them.
[02:46:42.955 --> 02:46:46.938]  But we also know she's lobbied for them and worked actually alongside of them multiple times.
[02:46:46.938 --> 02:46:51.180]  But directly saying that Monsanto is great and it's of the future and everything like
[02:46:51.480 --> 02:47:00.648]  So why are we allowing these people in our lives and allowing these people to continue to abuse us over and over again when we know history is repeating over and over and over?
[02:47:00.648 --> 02:47:18.224]  That's why we have made the decision and ultimately the public is alerting itself to the reality of this and that's why we have things like with what's going on Vermont and now 12 other states pushing for GMO labeling and I think we can in fact defeat this dark act but we're going to have to accept that we're in an abusive relationship and step out of it.
[02:47:18.524 --> 02:47:30.712]  If we don't defeat it, we are going into a dark age, because I tell you, if you don't have any say-so over not only, I mean, this began with things like forcing people to buy health care, insurance, anything with Obamacare.
[02:47:30.712 --> 02:47:36.876]  I mean, the model for the 21st century corporatism is to hold a gun to your head and say, buy it or else.
[02:47:36.876 --> 02:47:42.360]  And if they can do that with insurance and then go to do it with medicine and do it with food, we are done.
[02:47:42.360 --> 02:47:44.421]  So we are in the fight for our life.
[02:47:44.421 --> 02:47:45.222]  That is true.
[02:47:45.222 --> 02:47:45.762]  Thank you, Ron.
[02:47:45.762 --> 02:47:48.224]  Let's go to Lee in Minnesota.
[02:47:48.224 --> 02:47:48.364]  Lee?
[02:47:50.745 --> 02:47:53.747]  Good afternoon, David, Anthony, how are you doing?
[02:47:53.747 --> 02:47:54.867]  Doing good, great.
[02:47:54.867 --> 02:47:57.089]  What do you want to talk about?
[02:47:57.089 --> 02:48:07.254]  Good, I just wanted to give you guys and your listeners an update on what's been happening with Minnesota, especially on the vaccine issue.
[02:48:07.254 --> 02:48:16.099]  They've had the hearing on Minnesota Senate File 380 to remove, to make exemptions more difficult.
[02:48:17.600 --> 02:48:27.788]  Parents go to get educated by the CDC government propaganda doctors to supposedly inform them.
[02:48:27.788 --> 02:48:37.396]  And I wanted to tell the listeners out there that we have a great chance of defeating this here in Minnesota.
[02:48:37.396 --> 02:48:38.477]  And I also wanted to let you know
[02:48:39.301 --> 02:48:51.613]  That it is very important for everyone to film every committee hearing because unexpectedly, the audio file for the committee hearing accidentally got lost.
[02:48:51.613 --> 02:48:54.095]  Oh, gee, that's a shame.
[02:48:54.095 --> 02:49:02.163]  It took me tons and tons of pressure to put on the Secretary of the Senate and many, many of the Senators.
[02:49:03.454 --> 02:49:14.877]  And my senator and representative has been ignoring me, but finally they did amend the minutes to admit it was accidentally lost.
[02:49:14.877 --> 02:49:17.178]  Just like Nixon's tapes, yeah, exactly.
[02:49:17.178 --> 02:49:21.239]  Go ahead.
[02:49:21.239 --> 02:49:24.480]  And so we have a great chance of defeating this.
[02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:27.801]  It passed committee in the Senate.
[02:49:27.801 --> 02:49:28.601]  The House has...
[02:49:31.300 --> 02:49:40.829]  Probably won't be heard, and it's not going to be attached to an omnibus bill, so if people keep up the pressure, we can stop the push for forced vaccines.
[02:49:40.829 --> 02:49:47.314]  I wanted to ask Anthony a question, his thoughts on the whole label GMO movement as possibly a red herring.
[02:49:47.314 --> 02:49:55.562]  I think that because of what's happening in Europe, they don't push the GMOs over there so much, but here, they want to label it.
[02:49:55.562 --> 02:49:56.803]  Why don't we just
[02:49:58.549 --> 02:50:04.717]  And David, you talked about many of the points that I was thinking already, so I felt like you were reading my mind there.
[02:50:04.717 --> 02:50:07.782]  Well, I think you're asking why are they labeling it instead of banning it.
[02:50:07.782 --> 02:50:08.383]  Is that your question?
[02:50:09.472 --> 02:50:11.053]  Yes, ban glyphosate.
[02:50:11.053 --> 02:50:12.494]  Yes, exactly.
[02:50:12.494 --> 02:50:13.575]  You bring up a good point.
[02:50:13.575 --> 02:50:31.025]  Obviously, as we talked about a little bit yesterday, I think the main issue with GMOs beyond not knowing what they're doing and knowing they're destroying kidney function and liver function is the key element of glyphosate, which Monsanto has the patent for and puts in their number one best-selling herbicide, Roundup, which is integrated into GMO crops.
[02:50:31.485 --> 02:50:43.853]  Obviously, a ban would be the best systems, but in the United States, where it's so heavily controlled, if we could get labeling, they may actually financially not be able to produce as many GMOs, with Monsanto continuing to lose money, and we could defund them.
[02:50:43.853 --> 02:50:44.614]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:50:44.614 --> 02:50:46.115]  We're going to be right back with your calls.
[02:50:46.115 --> 02:50:46.935]  Thank you, Lee.
[02:50:46.935 --> 02:50:52.279]  And we're going to be right back after the break, talking about GMOs as well as vaccines.
[02:50:58.743 --> 02:51:02.369]  Why use dial-up when you can use broadband?
[02:51:02.369 --> 02:51:03.370]  Why travel with this?
[02:51:04.443 --> 02:51:06.284]  When you can use this.
[02:51:06.284 --> 02:51:12.248]  And why would anyone use colloidal or ionic silver when you can use supernatural silver?
[02:51:12.248 --> 02:51:19.493]  Supernatural silver is state-of-the-art and it's been clinically proven to be several hundred times more effective than those other silvers.
[02:51:19.493 --> 02:51:25.437]  It's powerful enough to protect you and your family from the threat of deadly viruses, bacteria and fungus.
[02:51:25.437 --> 02:51:28.659]  But it's so safe that it can be used internally or topically.
[02:51:29.139 --> 02:51:33.823]  And you'll never again deal with the nasty side effects of harsh drugs or antibiotics.
[02:51:33.823 --> 02:51:44.370]  Hundreds of scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals, and research institutions have all shown Supernatural Silver is a powerful weapon in the fight against invading pathogens.
[02:51:44.370 --> 02:51:47.592]  Supernatural Silver is a must-have for your arsenal.

[02:51:58.280 --> 02:51:58.840]  I want more candy!
[02:51:58.840 --> 02:51:59.820]  I want more video games!
[02:51:59.820 --> 02:51:59.980]  Mine!
[02:51:59.980 --> 02:52:00.180]  Mine!
[02:52:00.180 --> 02:52:01.501]  Mine!
[02:52:01.501 --> 02:52:11.223]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:52:11.223 --> 02:52:13.924]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:52:13.924 --> 02:52:17.485]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:52:17.485 --> 02:52:23.806]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:52:23.806 --> 02:52:26.327]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[02:52:26.527 --> 02:52:28.928]  And then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:52:28.928 --> 02:52:35.311]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[02:52:35.311 --> 02:52:43.055]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[02:52:43.055 --> 02:52:50.599]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[02:54:09.030 --> 02:54:14.395]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:14.395 --> 02:54:17.177]  I'm David Knight, and joining me in studio is Anthony Gucciardi.
[02:54:17.177 --> 02:54:18.999]  We're going to go back to your calls in just a moment.
[02:54:18.999 --> 02:54:24.404]  I just want to remind you that we have free shipping on X2, Survival Supermail.

[02:54:42.613 --> 02:54:44.975]  That's one way to protect yourself against fluoride.
[02:54:44.975 --> 02:54:50.998]  You can try to filter your water, and we do sell excellent filters that take that and glyphosate out at the Infowarsstore.com.
[02:54:51.858 --> 02:54:56.781]  But you're going to get exposed to fluoride in this environment that we live in everywhere in America.
[02:54:56.781 --> 02:54:59.742]  So that's one way that you can protect your body with fluoride shield.
[02:54:59.742 --> 02:55:00.923]  And you can try that now.
[02:55:00.923 --> 02:55:04.805]  Get a free bottle of that when you buy two bottles of X2 or Silver Bullet.
[02:55:04.805 --> 02:55:09.948]  And of course there's free shipping on a wide variety of products right now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:55:09.948 --> 02:55:11.349]  Let's go back to your calls.
[02:55:11.349 --> 02:55:13.070]  Let's go to Peggy in Texas.
[02:55:13.070 --> 02:55:13.270]  Peggy?
[02:55:15.174 --> 02:55:20.739]  Yes, I'd like to alert you and all your listeners to something I just found out last night.
[02:55:20.739 --> 02:55:24.302]  I bought some fish at the store and I read the label after I got home.
[02:55:24.302 --> 02:55:31.769]  The fish is preserved by using carbon monoxide to preserve the color.
[02:55:31.769 --> 02:55:32.670]  I was shocked.
[02:55:32.670 --> 02:55:37.395]  Why would people do something so crazy?
[02:55:37.395 --> 02:55:39.236]  Well, you know what's even more concerning with fish?
[02:55:40.171 --> 02:55:44.394]  Is that most of the salmon you're eating isn't actually a bright pink of that color.
[02:55:44.394 --> 02:55:46.675]  That's actually a food dye system.
[02:55:46.675 --> 02:55:50.197]  And seriously, it actually looks brown, which is fine.
[02:55:50.197 --> 02:55:55.060]  It's just like when you eat fruits that have little holes in them or something like that because they're super high quality organic.
[02:55:55.060 --> 02:55:55.681]  That's normal.
[02:55:56.121 --> 02:56:04.926]  But for some reason, we've been determined in getting these pristine-looking apples and this fish that's super, you know, beautiful and pink and everything like that.
[02:56:04.926 --> 02:56:24.937]  So what they've done is they've started to do all these invasive processes where they're layering it with chemicals, they're layering it with dyes that are based on tar systems, and they're putting those synthetic petroleum-based chemicals, like vitamins, into the food so they can say it's fortified with calcium and they can say it's fortified with vitamin E, so you think it's actually good for you.
[02:56:25.337 --> 02:56:30.941]  It's become an abomination system in this whole new paradigm of chemical living.
[02:56:30.941 --> 02:56:33.983]  So, absolutely, they're doing the craziest things to all your food.
[02:56:33.983 --> 02:56:38.346]  You'd be surprised, they radiate a lot of the spices that you're buying at the store.
[02:56:38.346 --> 02:56:47.812]  They radiate, well, they radiate everything, but specifically, they have a little symbol now touting how great it is, saying, oh my god, it's been radiated for your protection.
[02:56:47.812 --> 02:56:54.497]  Just like Alex talked about one day on the show, he got, it was like Papa John's pizza he found somewhere, and the little seasoning packets had a huge little,
[02:56:55.597 --> 02:56:56.797]  Let's go to Julie in Texas.
[02:56:56.797 --> 02:56:57.657]  Go ahead Julie.
[02:56:57.657 --> 02:56:58.138]  Thank you David.
[02:57:23.351 --> 02:57:42.338]  There is a soil scientist and cell biologist up in Canada named Dr. Thierry Brain, and he has made the point that he really believes GMOs, as bad as they really are, are red herring just to cover up the issue around glyphosates.
[02:57:42.338 --> 02:57:48.560]  Obviously, glyphosates can be used extensively, repeatedly on GMO crops.
[02:57:49.025 --> 02:57:57.112]  But it's also used as a desiccant on many, many types of grain that is not necessarily GMO.
[02:57:57.112 --> 02:58:03.097]  So if you're eating a grain that's not organic, it's quite possible that you're consuming even more glyphosate.
[02:58:03.669 --> 02:58:07.352]  Then you would be on, say, a GMO vegetable.
[02:58:07.352 --> 02:58:09.854]  No, you're right, and I've actually been saying this for a long time.
[02:58:09.854 --> 02:58:11.896]  I think that's true to a very large extent.
[02:58:11.896 --> 02:58:21.283]  I think GMOs themselves are dangerous, but the glyphosate, as the World Health Organization now admits, is the carcinogen that is really getting us and really killing us and really giving us cancer.
[02:58:21.283 --> 02:58:22.544]  So, is it a red herring?
[02:58:22.544 --> 02:58:24.446]  I don't know about that, but it's definitely overlooked.
[02:58:25.206 --> 02:58:26.787]  Well, that's it for today's broadcast.
[02:58:26.787 --> 02:58:29.589]  Join us tonight for the nightly news at 7 central.
[02:58:29.589 --> 02:58:31.110]  And again, join us on Sunday.
[02:58:31.110 --> 02:58:34.312]  Alex Jones will be back at 4 central.
[02:58:34.312 --> 02:58:41.837]  Join us then.
[02:58:41.837 --> 02:58:45.579]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:52.041 --> 02:59:01.788]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:59:01.788 --> 02:59:04.369]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:59:04.369 --> 02:59:08.052]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:59:08.052 --> 02:59:14.376]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:59:14.376 --> 02:59:18.899]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:59:18.899 --> 02:59:19.660]  That's right.
