[00:00:12.415 --> 00:00:15.957]  Alright sir, can you tell me what your name is, where you're from, and what brought you out here today?
[00:00:16.277 --> 00:00:17.218]  My name's Daniel Duclue.
[00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:18.659]  I'm from Bastrop, Texas.
[00:00:19.139 --> 00:00:20.300]  I went to school in Austin.
[00:00:21.341 --> 00:00:24.903]  And I'm a concerned American, Texan, Bastropian.
[00:00:25.223 --> 00:00:28.485]  I just think the government should be held accountable to the decisions they make.
[00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:35.169]  And I think it's our privilege and it's our duty as Americans to ask questions about what our government's doing.
[00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:40.772]  These are elected officials, or our judges, not the guy with the army.
[00:00:41.893 --> 00:00:44.255]  You know, I think it's our duty to hold them accountable, so.
[00:00:44.275 --> 00:00:45.876]  Okay, we're here with Cathy Glass.
[00:00:45.896 --> 00:00:50.139]  You ran for governor this past election, and I was very surprised to see you come out here for this Jade Helm.
[00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:51.440]  Why is it so significant to you?
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:03.629]  Well, my husband and I have a small ranch in McDade, so we live half-life in Houston and half-life out here in Lee County, actually, so what's happening in Bastrop is very important to us, but it's important to all Texans.
[00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:05.890]  This is not just a local thing going on.
[00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.431]  What are you going to talk about?
[00:01:07.451 --> 00:01:08.212]  Talking about the girls?
[00:01:08.452 --> 00:01:09.433]  Jade Helm, let's stop.
[00:01:10.518 --> 00:01:11.999]  We're still doing ground rules, correct?
[00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:13.359]  Yeah, I'm still doing them.
[00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:14.039]  Okay, alright.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.760]  Jay Hillman, Bastrop.
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.520]  Yes, sir.
[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.681]  Okay, alright.
[00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:18.221]  Anything else?
[00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:19.661]  How many questions are you going to ask?
[00:01:20.342 --> 00:01:22.342]  Did you ask everybody how many questions they're going to ask?
[00:01:22.362 --> 00:01:22.842]  She asked you several.
[00:01:22.862 --> 00:01:24.883]  I'm asking you how many questions do you plan on asking?
[00:01:24.983 --> 00:01:26.744]  Let's say I'll stop at five max.
[00:01:26.904 --> 00:01:27.344]  Five max.
[00:01:28.645 --> 00:01:28.865]  Three?
[00:01:29.365 --> 00:01:29.585]  Three.
[00:01:29.605 --> 00:01:30.185]  Let's go three.
[00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:30.625]  Alright.
[00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:33.866]  I'll just have you say and spell your name and position.
[00:01:34.107 --> 00:01:38.188]  Lieutenant Colonel Mark LaStoria, Director of Public Affairs, United States Army Special Operations Command.
[00:01:38.558 --> 00:01:39.018]  All right, Colonel.
[00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:46.846]  You spent a lot of time answering questions, so I'm trying not to be redundant, but just in the most general soundbite sense, what is Jade Helm?
[00:01:47.246 --> 00:01:51.009]  Jade Helm is a training exercise to produce top quality U.S.
[00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.293]  Army Special Operations Forces for operations overseas, future operations overseas.
[00:01:55.714 --> 00:01:55.934]  Okay.
[00:01:56.795 --> 00:01:59.237]  And you had a lot of concern here today.
[00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:05.179]  There were a lot of questions asked here today and I was really supportive of that.
[00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:13.967]  I think local governance is a fantastic thing and much like the judge said, it would be great if everybody came out in force like that to all of their meetings.
[00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:15.848]  Local governance is where things happen.
[00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.571]  I'll try to be as concise as possible.
[00:02:20.591 --> 00:02:24.995]  I just had a question about Metris Global and Thomas Meade, I believe, are involved in this operation.
[00:02:25.216 --> 00:02:25.716]  I'm sorry, who?
[00:02:25.956 --> 00:02:27.277]  Metris Global and Thomas Meade.
[00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:29.920]  I'm not familiar with, what was the first thing again?
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.640]  Metris Global.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.621]  No, I'm not familiar with that.
[00:02:31.721 --> 00:02:32.162]  Thomas Meade.
[00:02:32.462 --> 00:02:34.824]  Thomas Meade, he is a coordinator for the exercise.
[00:02:35.305 --> 00:02:38.588]  Alright, I'm here with ZZ Arnetta, former InfoWars reporter.
[00:02:39.268 --> 00:02:43.392]  You were here, you asked a question, what do you think about this Jade Helm operation and also their response to it?
[00:02:43.783 --> 00:02:49.467]  Well, overall, I think I'm mostly disappointed in the way that they let the public know.
[00:02:49.487 --> 00:02:58.473]  I found out about it from a Bastrop County paper on the internet, and it was coming out the same time it came out on InfoWars.
[00:02:59.413 --> 00:03:05.137]  It's like they're saying one thing, and then they're saying another thing at the same time out of both sides of their mouth, so it's confusing.
[00:03:06.058 --> 00:03:13.503]  When you're talking about putting people in civilian clothing, I just do not understand what that matters, since this is supposed to be about foreign territory.
[00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:22.202]  I was just concerned with the increasing indications that the military is getting a little too involved with local law enforcement.
[00:03:22.782 --> 00:03:41.428]  First of all, we got this military assault vehicle that signed to our Sheriff's Department, and then we have all these strange things happening, coming in here like this military operation, which is not new for our county because we have Camp Swift and I have helicopters flying over my property all the time.
[00:03:41.448 --> 00:03:42.609]  I don't have any problem with that.
[00:03:43.874 --> 00:03:52.451]  The thing that the indications that are happening that they're getting so involved that it does appear there is some martial law intent.
[00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:56.894]  You know, I think one concern of mine is, well, first of all, I grew up here.
[00:03:56.954 --> 00:04:04.156]  I know Camp Swift is a big military base, so I am used to seeing people in uniform, and I have utmost respect for people in uniform and their sacrifice.
[00:04:05.497 --> 00:04:12.840]  I think what concerns me the most is I'm a student of history, and I know that governments go tyrannical.
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.381]  And I know that also our government, through the Homeland Security, has labeled people
[00:04:21.781 --> 00:04:31.243]  Like the kinds of people that live in Bastrop that are conservative gun owners, libertarians, veterans, the government's labeled those people as potential terrorists.
[00:04:31.803 --> 00:04:41.764]  And so I do see an odd correlation between a huge military buildup and a hostile designation for the state of Texas in this area.
[00:04:41.804 --> 00:04:44.005]  I mean, it's not happening up in Washington, D.C.
[00:04:44.365 --> 00:04:51.106]  Now, with what you heard today, do you think there should be any type of recourse for the public to have their voices heard as far as canceling the drill?
[00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:54.480]  If enough public outcry came about, do you think they should cancel the drill?
[00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:56.201]  Certainly, I think so.
[00:04:57.101 --> 00:05:01.583]  The problem I have with today's get-together is it was one-sided, okay?
[00:05:02.383 --> 00:05:03.784]  We were allowed to ask questions.
[00:05:03.904 --> 00:05:08.766]  We were not allowed, except spontaneously, to express our dissatisfaction.
[00:05:09.386 --> 00:05:11.287]  And I think it's an obligation on
[00:05:11.887 --> 00:05:26.563]  The people making the presentation and the County Commissioner's Court to understand why the people feel the way they do and why it appears, whether it is or not, it appears to be the implementation of martial law.
[00:05:27.253 --> 00:05:33.615]  Of course they should, and there will be another county commissioner's meeting, and if this can be put on the agenda, then they can force another vote.
[00:05:33.655 --> 00:05:41.757]  Maybe it'll be the same way, but I think at least one of the commissioners would have to put it on the agenda, and then it can be voted on after the information has come forward.
[00:05:42.017 --> 00:05:43.038]  That's the way it should be.
[00:05:43.738 --> 00:05:44.838]  That's the whole point, isn't it?
[00:05:45.358 --> 00:05:46.478]  Are we supposed to be able to vote?
[00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:47.659]  We weren't even told!
[00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:49.701]  People here in this county weren't told.
[00:05:49.921 --> 00:05:51.863]  I didn't even know that it was already voted on.
[00:05:52.044 --> 00:05:55.047]  I was coming up the stairs and someone had said that and I was so shocked.
[00:05:55.107 --> 00:05:55.928]  I'm like, what do you mean?
[00:05:56.269 --> 00:05:57.631]  People are just finding out about it.
[00:05:58.332 --> 00:06:00.734]  So yeah, this is seriously messed up.
[00:06:01.636 --> 00:06:11.440]  You know, we're a democracy, but we're, you know, we're a democratic republic, so we hire representatives to listen to the majority, but also protect the rights of the minority.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:20.324]  So, you know, if no one's rights are being violated, then people have the right to do what they want to do, and the military has the right to practice drills.
[00:06:21.704 --> 00:06:26.886]  But at the same time, I'm not quite sure that our rights are being protected.
[00:06:27.427 --> 00:06:30.488]  So I think it's the job of our elected officials to protect our rights.
[00:06:31.193 --> 00:06:44.418]  The only thing I would say is this is taking place on private land and I understand that people may have concerns but that private land owner has their rights as well too and they not only in their word but also in their deed support the U.S.
[00:06:44.498 --> 00:06:47.299]  Army and Army Special Operations Command and we're thankful for that.
[00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:52.000]  And I believe you said most of it's going to be on private land or did you say all of it's going to be on private land?
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.421]  For Bastille County it's all on private land.
[00:06:53.871 --> 00:07:01.596]  There's a reason that people have problems with this, and those are, it's not irrational fears, it's well-founded fears.
[00:07:01.937 --> 00:07:12.664]  And if you're talking about this new warfare, this asymmetrical warfare, well these gentlemen that came need to learn that what you need in those situations is the backing of the populace.
[00:07:14.085 --> 00:07:15.225]  They need to buy into it.
[00:07:15.265 --> 00:07:16.185]  They need to support you.
[00:07:16.566 --> 00:07:24.727]  And if there's one thing that this training exercise should have told them right now, one thing they should have already learned, is that they do not have the backing of the people for this exercise.
[00:07:25.047 --> 00:07:25.568]  They blew it.
[00:07:25.588 --> 00:07:26.668]  They blew an opportunity.
[00:07:26.688 --> 00:07:33.149]  They came in as though they were occupying force and were just being kind to answer our questions.
[00:07:33.489 --> 00:07:36.870]  No, they should have been courting us and answering us.
[00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.931]  And maybe there would have been a different outcome from this meeting if they'd come in with a different attitude.
[00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:59.710]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential foreclosure situation?
[00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:03.073]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:08:03.173 --> 00:08:04.775]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:08:04.815 --> 00:08:10.981]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:08:11.141 --> 00:08:17.085]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:20.967]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:24.049]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:32.234]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:08:32.514 --> 00:08:34.555]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:08:34.615 --> 00:08:35.656]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:44.759]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
