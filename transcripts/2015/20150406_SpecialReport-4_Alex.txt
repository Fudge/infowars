[00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:17.871]  There is an extra special and rare total lunar eclipse taking place this Saturday morning.
[00:00:18.191 --> 00:00:20.652]  It has some people worried for this Easter weekend.
[00:00:21.132 --> 00:00:31.557]  The blood moon is a rare celestial event, yet for the third time in less than a year, the moon will dip behind the Earth's shadow, appearing a deep coppery red for a few minutes.
[00:00:31.877 --> 00:00:38.220]  And this will transform the skies over North America, Asia and Australia into a deep red color.
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.222]  Now, there are several interesting things about this particular blood moon.
[00:00:42.622 --> 00:00:48.645]  While some eclipses can last an hour or more, this will be the shortest lunar eclipse of this century.
[00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:56.969]  It's also taking place the morning of Easter Vigil, which is traditionally observed as the period between Good Friday and Easter Sunday.
[00:00:57.509 --> 00:01:05.876]  The eclipse also falls within the first night of Passover, which is observed by Jews worldwide beginning Friday at sunset.
[00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:15.584]  According to NASA, the rare tetrad of four alignments in close proximity has only happened a handful of times in the last 2,000 years.
[00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:20.367]  The final blood moon eclipse of the tetrad series will take place September 28, 2015
[00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.612]  Which also happens to be a Jewish holiday.
[00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:34.260]  Many people believe that these lunar eclipses and their appearance on auspicious dates signals a world-changing event that's about to take place.
[00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:43.449]  The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes.
[00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.410]  Joel 2.31
[00:01:46.786 --> 00:01:58.197]  Now regardless if you believe in the blood moon prophecies or whether or not God created the sun, moon and stars to be signs for mankind, we are witnessing a pivotal time in the Middle East.
[00:01:58.417 --> 00:02:01.620]  Current events seem to be moving us toward World War III.
[00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:09.068]  So whether or not these blood moons are warning us about nuclear war, it's safe to say that something pretty major is about to happen.
[00:02:09.588 --> 00:02:13.669]  Now, there's something else about this Tetrad series that's pretty bizarre.
[00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.290]  It happens to fall in a Shemitah year.
[00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:20.172]  This is something that hasn't happened for 2,000 years.
[00:02:21.032 --> 00:02:31.636]  Rabbi Jonathan Kahn points out in his book, The Mystery of the Shemitah, that these years in the past have brought down economies, kingdoms, and nations that haven't followed God's will.
[00:02:32.456 --> 00:02:34.678]  A very major thing happened that escaped most people.
[00:02:35.038 --> 00:02:52.172]  The Shemitah began in the autumn of 2014 and what happened is within two weeks, well actually within one week of it beginning, and remember the Shemitah can mean the fall, within one week America was overtaken, Russia became the greatest nuclear power on earth, it actually surpassed the first week of the Shemitah.
[00:02:52.492 --> 00:03:04.341]  The second week of the Shemitah came something even more major, and that is that the American age that began in the year 1871, when we became the strongest economic power on Earth, came to an end.
[00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:06.642]  America was dethroned.
[00:03:06.963 --> 00:03:11.065]  As the Shemitah began, it is now China has taken the crown of America.
[00:03:11.386 --> 00:03:14.408]  Now I've warned for it since the Harbinger came out, I've warned
[00:03:14.768 --> 00:03:15.169]  We're good to go.
[00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.510]  Often at the beginning of the Shemitah, you don't notice anything, but there are often foreshadows.
[00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.412]  Well, the major thing, if something's going to happen, the major period is going to be coming up.
[00:03:43.472 --> 00:03:46.993]  It's always at the end of the Shemitah, as we approach September.
[00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:48.533]  That's the time of that wipeout.
[00:03:48.813 --> 00:03:51.814]  I'm not saying it has to happen, but I believe we need to be aware of it.
[00:03:52.214 --> 00:04:00.484]  And interesting, people who look at signs, one of the signs in the Bible of judgment is the darkening of the sun, or an eclipse.
[00:04:00.784 --> 00:04:02.266]  Not that it always is, but it can be.
[00:04:02.726 --> 00:04:10.355]  On the day that we get to the Wipeout Day, Elul 29 of this Shemitah cycle, the sun's going to be darkened at that time.
[00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:11.476]  The last time that happened was 1987.
[00:04:12.537 --> 00:04:19.801]  When the sun was darkened at Alul 29, it led into Black Monday, the worst day crash in world history.
[00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:34.009]  I believe we are going to watch, if we don't turn back, if this nation keeps on going on its course, we're going to watch the fall of America, or the shaking of America, and the American age that you and I, and all our listeners have known since we were born, is going to come to an end.
[00:04:34.471 --> 00:04:37.213]  You can witness this rare event for yourself.
[00:04:37.293 --> 00:04:40.295]  The action starts at 5.16 a.m.
[00:04:40.515 --> 00:04:43.797]  Central Standard Time on the morning of April 4th.
[00:04:44.178 --> 00:04:50.982]  The Earth's shadow will slowly move across the moon, covering it entirely just before 7 a.m.
[00:04:51.403 --> 00:04:58.648]  I know that's a little bit early on a Saturday, but it's going to be a breathtaking spectacle and you're alive, so get up early and witness it.
