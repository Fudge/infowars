[00:00:12.628 --> 00:00:14.530]  I heard the outcry from people like yourself.
[00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.193]  I looked at the Republican Party platform and saw it had been in there.
[00:00:21.395 --> 00:00:26.119]  And I looked at the general attitude that many people in this building have had for years.
[00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:33.285]  Which is that they believe that your rights can be controlled by them.
[00:00:35.027 --> 00:00:36.188]  And I would argue that with them.
[00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:39.711]  Because I believe that the Second Amendment
[00:00:40.595 --> 00:00:44.258]  It doesn't come from a government institution, a bureaucrat, or a politician.
[00:00:44.718 --> 00:00:45.819]  It comes from God Almighty.
[00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:54.385]  What brought me out here is I'm sick and tired of asking the government for permission to use my Second Amendment rights.
[00:00:54.865 --> 00:01:00.890]  And I was proud to join up with a lot of these constituents here and demanding that the government give them back.
[00:01:01.912 --> 00:01:10.595]  What I'm trying to achieve is to restore the Constitution the way it was intended, so that we don't have to pass a test, pay a fee or a fine to get our Second Amendment rights.
[00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:13.636]  Texans have the right to defend themselves regardless of the situation.
[00:01:14.216 --> 00:01:20.219]  HB 195 would allow open carry or concealed carry, and it would make the CHL process optional.
[00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:29.202]  So we will still have the CHL for reciprocity reasons across the state, but if you're in Texas and you stay in Texas, then it's up to you whether you submit to that or not.
[00:01:29.562 --> 00:01:39.385]  If you applied the same principles that some of the bureaucrats and politicians here in Austin are trying to apply to the Second Amendment, if you tried to do that to the First Amendment, people would be absolutely going insane.
[00:01:39.505 --> 00:01:47.348]  I would ask that anybody that loves liberty, loves the notion of personal responsibility, and doesn't think that our rights come from government, but from God, to join us in this fight.
