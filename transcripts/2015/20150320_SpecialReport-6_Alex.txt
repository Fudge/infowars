[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.451]  And don't tell me that I'm a weirdo because I'm upset about this.
[00:00:02.551 --> 00:00:04.713]  I'm just sick of dishonorable trash.
[00:00:04.914 --> 00:00:08.097]  Supreme Cobra Commander!
[00:00:08.137 --> 00:00:08.937]  You're failures!
[00:00:08.977 --> 00:00:11.660]  You think I'd sell my family out like you dirtbag?
[00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:15.544]  Kit Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[00:00:15.784 --> 00:00:21.529]  Now recently Starbucks has been instructing its employees to talk to their customers about race.
[00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:25.010]  I'm not even joking as ridiculous as that sounds.
[00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.132]  So me and my co-worker Jakari Jackson, who's been a friend of mine for years.
[00:00:29.172 --> 00:00:31.052]  We hung out a lot together outside of work.
[00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:37.575]  We're gonna go to Starbucks and see if the employees will talk to us about this racial division that him and I didn't know we had between us.
[00:00:38.135 --> 00:00:39.756]  Tall cafe latte and a green tea.
[00:00:39.776 --> 00:00:43.117]  Tall cafe latte and a green tea.
[00:00:43.137 --> 00:00:47.799]  What's your name?
[00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:48.199]  Daniels.
[00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:48.759]  Jackson.
[00:00:51.912 --> 00:00:53.453]  What's that?
[00:00:54.374 --> 00:00:56.396]  Yeah.
[00:00:56.476 --> 00:01:04.242]  Well, me and my buddy get along great, but we were told by Starbucks that we had some racial division we didn't know we had.
[00:01:04.262 --> 00:01:06.864]  Have you been directed to do anything?
[00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:32.616]  No, I think they're rolling out in Seattle, kind of the hub, and then maybe on the East Coast is where they're starting to be at, people with names that are more difficult to pronounce and stuff, instead of just attempting to spell, or attempting to understand, actually bringing up conversation.
[00:01:32.636 --> 00:01:35.216]  Do you think coffee will help heal wet racial wounds?
[00:01:35.296 --> 00:01:36.437]  I guess, yeah.
[00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:40.198]  I mean, it's an interesting plan, but he's been trying to be very progressive.
[00:01:41.858 --> 00:01:43.779]  Can I get a tall, cool line?
[00:01:46.324 --> 00:01:50.005]  Daniels.
[00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:55.507]  And also I want to buy my black friend here a also a tall cool line.
[00:01:56.067 --> 00:02:00.188]  So what's that thing about like your CEO or somebody said something about racers?
[00:02:00.568 --> 00:02:04.609]  I didn't hear anything about that.
[00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.950]  Would y'all say you'd be hesitant about doing something like that personally?
[00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.410]  I actually didn't hear anything about it.
[00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.371]  Basically you're asked to talk about race relations to your customers.
[00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:13.967]  Oh, really?
[00:02:14.268 --> 00:02:15.448]  Okay, I like that.
[00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:19.111]  Yeah, Starbucks employees.
[00:02:21.272 --> 00:02:27.456]  Basically, would you feel comfortable talking about race to someone you don't know that's a customer?
[00:02:29.677 --> 00:02:32.259]  Yeah.
[00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.641]  How am I supposed to drink this peacefully with my black friend if you're not going to race together on it?
[00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:41.832]  So we've gone to a couple restaurants.
[00:02:41.872 --> 00:02:42.913]  We have our cups here.
[00:02:43.213 --> 00:02:46.716]  They didn't write anything racial on them like we've seen in some of the other reports.
[00:02:47.256 --> 00:02:50.278]  So we talked to the guys and they answered the questions the best way they could.
[00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:52.580]  The first guy said, yeah, I know about it.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.821]  It's something from corporate.
[00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:56.763]  But, you know, it's not something we really consider to be a priority.
[00:02:57.003 --> 00:02:59.605]  The other place we went, the guy said, hey, I don't know anything about that at all.
[00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:02.067]  So regardless, they're touching this thing with kid gloves.
[00:03:02.087 --> 00:03:02.927]  I'm not going to understand.
[00:03:03.207 --> 00:03:08.051]  But it seems like these baristas are content to disregard the orders from corporate.
[00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:17.003]  A coffee and also would like you to help us mend our racial tensions we didn't know we had between us.
[00:03:18.224 --> 00:03:21.987]  We have, supposedly we have racial tensions between us we didn't know we had according to Starbucks.
[00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:23.007]  Oh, you can't help us?
[00:03:23.027 --> 00:03:24.168]  That's not what your CEO told us.
[00:03:24.188 --> 00:03:25.509]  Okay, okay, yeah.
[00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:26.089]  Yeah, okay, okay.
[00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.030]  Just a tall coffee.
[00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:29.992]  Yeah, it's coffee of the day.
[00:03:30.012 --> 00:03:30.372]  What's up?
[00:03:30.452 --> 00:03:31.153]  Take a medium.
[00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:44.350]  Absolutely.
[00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:55.220]  Starbucks' race relations program is also particularly concerning because it may set a precedent for other corporations to lecture its customers over societal issues.
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.124]  For example, many major retailers are adamantly anti-gun.
[00:04:00.424 --> 00:04:04.168]  Do you really want them to lecture you about gun control over a cash register?
[00:04:05.458 --> 00:04:13.106]  Now as you just saw, the barista was more interested in serving us coffee and serving his other customers than he was talking to us about race relations.
[00:04:13.546 --> 00:04:16.269]  And he was doing his job, and exactly what his job is supposed to be.
[00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.491]  Serve coffee, not talk about race to customers.
[00:04:19.032 --> 00:04:23.256]  Which is ultimately going to make, not only baristas, but customers weirded out.
[00:04:23.717 --> 00:04:28.622]  Now while there is racism in America, it's not quite as widespread as the establishment wants you to believe.
[00:04:28.962 --> 00:04:40.513]  They want you to think there's a racist under every rock on every street corner and thereby in order to flare up racial tension because a population that is divided can be easier to control.
[00:04:40.934 --> 00:04:42.555]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com
