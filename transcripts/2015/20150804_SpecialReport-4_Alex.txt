[00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:12.867]  As crazy as it sounds, a recent Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage may soon allow pedophiles to argue they are suffering discrimination.
[00:00:13.427 --> 00:00:27.059]  Using the same tactics used by gay rights activists, pedophiles have begun to seek similar status, arguing their desire for children is a sexual orientation no different than heterosexual or homosexuals, writes Jack Minor for the Northern Colorado Gazette.
[00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:36.107]  Minor notes that psychiatrists are now beginning to advocate redefining pedophilia in the same way homosexuality was redefined several years ago.
[00:00:36.287 --> 00:00:39.369]  Homosexuality was long considered a mental illness.
[00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.815]  However, in 1973, the American Psychiatric Association declassified it from a list of mental disorders.
[00:00:46.536 --> 00:00:50.438]  There's no cure for pedophilia, Charlie, because pedophilia isn't a sickness.
[00:00:50.578 --> 00:00:52.259]  Let's be absolutely clear.
[00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.861]  There's something in the brain of a pedophile that's different from what's in the brain of a non-pedophile.
[00:00:57.881 --> 00:01:03.664]  We're able to make much more direct contact with these people when we indicate to them that we know that they didn't choose this.
[00:01:04.024 --> 00:01:09.086]  We know that they really had no opportunity to select what they're going to be attracted to.
[00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:15.349]  More recently, a self-described organization of minor attracted people, Before You Act,
[00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:23.814]  held a symposium proposing a new definition of pedophilia in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders of the APA.
[00:01:23.994 --> 00:01:42.044]  B4U Act and other pedophile advocacy organizations cite an APA-issued report claiming that the negative potential of adult sex with children was overstated and that the vast majority of both men and women reported no negative sexual effects from childhood sexual abuse experiences.
[00:01:42.344 --> 00:01:52.390]  In 2013, California Congresswoman Representative Jackie Speier, a Democrat, proposed federalizing a state law prohibiting counseling to change a person's sexual orientation.
[00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:59.755]  The bill, according to critics, defines pedophilia as a sexual orientation and would afford the same rights granted to homosexuals.
[00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:10.522]  This language is so broad and vague, it arguably could include all forms of sexual orientation, including pedophilia, said Brad Dacus, president of the Pacific Justice Institute.
[00:02:10.982 --> 00:02:17.284]  It's not just the orientation that is protected, the conduct associated with the orientation is protected as well.
[00:02:17.424 --> 00:02:22.465]  In 2014, the New York Times argued in favor of civil rights for pedophiles.
[00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:37.049]  Margot Kaplan wrote for the newspaper that around 1% of people sexually attracted to children must hide their disorder from everyone they know or risk losing educational and job opportunities, and face the prospect of harassment and even violence.
[00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:41.272]  This is essentially the same argument used to mainstream homosexuality.
[00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:49.460]  Representative Paul Stam handed out a two-page list of definitions of sexual orientation, comparing it to incest and pedophilia.
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.121]  It was so offensive.
[00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:57.747]  I've never really seen anybody make such a blatant ignorant statement and then try to support it with a document.
[00:02:57.987 --> 00:03:03.309]  Brandon, who represents Guilford County, is openly gay and says Stam's comments were painful.
[00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.971]  It's hurtful that you would compare me personally to a pedophile.
[00:03:10.051 --> 00:03:19.754]  In point of fact, writes Michael Brown, all the principal arguments commonly used to normalize homosexuality have been used to normalize pedophilia and pederasty.
[00:03:19.994 --> 00:03:26.296]  Jerome Corsi, writing for World Net Daily, is concerned pedophilia will become the next sexual rights revolution.
[00:03:26.576 --> 00:03:35.338]  Corsi points to the normalizing of sexual pathology that occurred following research by Alfred Kinsey and the Kinsey Institute into sexual variations.
[00:03:35.728 --> 00:03:39.630]  Corsi cites Judith Reisman in her 2010 book Sexual Sabotage.
[00:03:57.981 --> 00:04:00.424]  These truths are difficult to accept, yet crucial.
[00:04:00.724 --> 00:04:10.033]  Americans must come to understand what has gone wrong, and how we can change from a family-oriented and flawed but honorable country, to a sex-obsessed and violent one.
[00:04:10.461 --> 00:04:19.793]  I'm saying that there are people that were the people that did this to both me and Corey that are still working, they're still out there, and they're some of the richest, most powerful people in this business.
[00:04:20.013 --> 00:04:22.796]  And they do not want me saying what I'm saying right now.
[00:04:23.717 --> 00:04:25.259]  Are you saying that they're pedophiles?
[00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:25.680]  Yes.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.422]  And that they're still in this business?
[00:04:27.442 --> 00:04:27.602]  Yes.
[00:04:28.428 --> 00:04:40.938]  And if Washington doesn't have enough to talk about these days, the Washington Times reported today that unidentified White House aides in the Carter, Reagan, and Bush administrations now are being investigated for using the services of a callboy ring.
[00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:46.023]  The paper reports that two of the male prostitutes were given a late-night tour of the White House last year.
[00:04:53.484 --> 00:04:59.591]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:04:59.611 --> 00:05:02.935]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:05:02.955 --> 00:05:04.657]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:05:04.697 --> 00:05:10.864]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:05:11.024 --> 00:05:16.946]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:05:17.086 --> 00:05:20.848]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:05:21.048 --> 00:05:23.949]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:32.133]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:05:32.413 --> 00:05:34.433]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:05:34.493 --> 00:05:35.554]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:05:35.894 --> 00:05:44.664]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
