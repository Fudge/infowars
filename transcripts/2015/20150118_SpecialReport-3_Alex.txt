[00:00:07.796 --> 00:00:09.777]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[00:00:10.017 --> 00:00:16.340]  Now, we are standing outside of the Curtis Colwell Convention Center in Garland, Texas, just above Dallas, Texas.
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.062]  Now, today there's going to be a rally at 5 p.m., the Stand with the Prophet rally.
[00:00:21.222 --> 00:00:26.764]  There's going to be a lot of controversial Islamic speakers, an imam from New York City that is coming here.
[00:00:27.064 --> 00:00:32.507]  We first read in the Washington Free Beacon article a few days ago that this was going to happen.
[00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:40.254]  And I kind of had an idea that there would probably be some people in a small town like this in Texas that are going to show up and protest this.
[00:00:40.294 --> 00:00:47.221]  And as you can see back here, there are hundreds of people lined up and down the road, waving their American flags, Jewish flags.
[00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:54.828]  A lot of people have the Jesus Charlie signs up from the attacks that happened in France at Charlie Hebdo.
[00:00:55.128 --> 00:00:55.529]  What's your name?
[00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:56.770]  I'm just a boy, Rocco.
[00:00:57.475 --> 00:00:57.975]  Nice to meet you.
[00:00:57.995 --> 00:00:59.096]  So why are you out here today, sir?
[00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:00.937]  Well, it's a nice day, number one.
[00:01:01.817 --> 00:01:19.006]  And number two, you know, it's everybody's right to practice their religion and live their lives and kind of get along, and so... Well, so I heard that one of the main reasons of the rally was just kind of squash of a lot of the Islamophobia that they say is created by the mainstream media.
[00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:21.948]  Do you believe the mainstream media hypes up this Islamophobia?
[00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.370]  I feel they're benefiting from that industry, yeah.
[00:01:26.365 --> 00:01:26.825]  And how so?
[00:01:27.605 --> 00:01:29.786]  Well, it just keeps people making money.
[00:01:30.827 --> 00:01:33.007]  What do you think about the Charlie Hebdo attacks?
[00:01:33.787 --> 00:01:34.908]  I think it was a tragedy.
[00:01:36.448 --> 00:01:39.409]  So, in any kind of way, do you condone anything like that whatsoever?
[00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:40.910]  Because a lot of people think... No.
[00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.471]  I don't condone any killing of anybody.
[00:01:44.751 --> 00:01:46.652]  And you support freedom of speech, right?
[00:01:46.832 --> 00:01:46.992]  Yes.
[00:01:48.618 --> 00:01:52.321]  So you have no problem with the other side as well coming out here to speak their minds and all that?
[00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:57.584]  As long as no one forces their religion on you and you don't do it to them, everyone's fine and dandy, right?
[00:01:57.624 --> 00:01:57.904]  Exactly.
[00:01:58.385 --> 00:02:03.888]  I like the idea of the bikers going around, you know, making their Harleys all nice and loud and it's cool.
[00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:07.831]  Now, what do you think about one of the people that were going to come out here to speak today?
[00:02:08.452 --> 00:02:16.318]  They said that one of the men, the Imam from New York, had possible ties, and I don't think he was ever indicted, but in the 93 bombings of the World Trade Center.
[00:02:16.578 --> 00:02:18.800]  What do you think about someone like that coming in here and speaking?
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.022]  Don't you think that's going to have some kind of a sour look on it?
[00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:33.331]  No, I don't, because he's... I've attended a high school graduation two years ago, where he was the keynote speaker, and he's been here several times, and I don't understand why all of a sudden
[00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:37.655]  It was just, you know, a perfect storm where, you know, it happened.
[00:02:37.715 --> 00:02:39.057]  But he's been here often.
[00:02:39.637 --> 00:02:40.859]  And there's been many other Muslims.
[00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.824]  There's been Eid prayers here every year for I don't know how long.
[00:02:45.905 --> 00:02:46.745]  So, I mean, this is...
[00:02:49.108 --> 00:02:55.473]  To me it was a little odd living here and then reading what you... on Facebook and whatnot.
[00:02:55.493 --> 00:02:57.354]  My name is Alif Rahman, one of the organizers.
[00:02:58.074 --> 00:03:01.617]  So if you see an orange shirt, you can find us and talk to us.
[00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:05.860]  ISIS, ISIL, is a terrorist organization.
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.422]  They are a shame for humanity.
[00:03:08.462 --> 00:03:10.503]  They are a shame for our religion.
[00:03:10.683 --> 00:03:12.925]  So you don't condone anything they do whatsoever?
[00:03:13.205 --> 00:03:14.086]  They are criminals.
[00:03:14.656 --> 00:03:17.999]  They need to be rounded up and tried as criminals.
[00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:25.204]  If you look at their strategy, they're focusing on the young people between 18 and 24, who are already frustrated.
[00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:26.625]  They don't know much.
[00:03:26.946 --> 00:03:29.147]  And so it's easy to bring it in.
[00:03:29.528 --> 00:03:32.590]  So they work as corporate business structures.
[00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.811]  They are after money.
[00:03:34.171 --> 00:03:37.154]  And everybody wants to use Islam because it's the easiest scapegoat.
[00:03:37.714 --> 00:03:42.056]  But they do not use the Quran or any of our sources, neither on either side.
[00:03:42.536 --> 00:03:44.957]  So they are feeding off of the frustration of the young people.
[00:03:45.397 --> 00:03:50.299]  As far as we are concerned, they are criminals, have no place in the humanity, and they need to be tried.
