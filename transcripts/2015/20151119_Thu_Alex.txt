[00:00:05.578 --> 00:00:06.899]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.661]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:10.423]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.423 --> 00:00:12.005]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:13.566]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:17.751]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:21.815]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:35.193]  Is this what we can expect at an NFL or NBA game in the very near future?
[00:00:35.193 --> 00:00:41.178]  As the Bilderberg puppets of doom run civilization into an engineered grinding hall.
[00:00:41.178 --> 00:00:43.820]  Shielded by faux blameless compassion.
[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.702]  Call it fear-mongering, I call it reality.
[00:00:46.702 --> 00:00:48.984]  Folks, things are getting dangerous.
[00:00:49.364 --> 00:00:57.429]  House GOP Caucus Chairman Glenn Cassata said, we need to activate the Tennessee National Guard and stop them from coming into the state, i.e.
[00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.251]  the refugees, by whatever means we can.
[00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:05.254]  Note to bleeding heart liberals that disagree with the previous statement from a man of action.
[00:01:05.254 --> 00:01:13.419]  The blood of Americans will be on your hands because of your fake, brainwashed liberal stance that could get us all killed.
[00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:16.001]  The jihadists are already in the United States.
[00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:20.243]  A complete nightmare scenario, courtesy of our Commandeer-in-Chief.
[00:01:20.243 --> 00:01:34.348]  The Daily Mail reports nearly 70 arrests have already been made of homegrown and refugee jihadists in the United States, including six Bosnian immigrants, three from Missouri, two from Illinois, and one from New York, were charged in February.
[00:01:34.668 --> 00:01:35.268]  We're good to go.
[00:01:54.258 --> 00:01:55.559]  Two Minneapolis U.S.
[00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:58.480]  natives went to Syria and died fighting for ISIS.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.042]  This exposed the Midwest as a hotbed for ISIS recruits.
[00:02:02.042 --> 00:02:12.807]  The growing Somali refugee population in the Midwest has already produced eight Somali friends who were charged with conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.
[00:02:12.807 --> 00:02:21.372]  One of those charged includes 20-year-old Abdurahman Yassin Daud, who was born at a refugee camp in Kenya and arrived in the U.S.
[00:02:21.372 --> 00:02:22.132]  when he was nine.
[00:02:22.532 --> 00:02:24.873]  According to the Minnesota Star Tribune.
[00:02:24.873 --> 00:02:27.454]  Other incidents include, a former U.S.
[00:02:27.454 --> 00:02:30.935]  Air Force serviceman from New Jersey joined the Mujahideen.
[00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:38.018]  Two cousins, one a National Guard soldier from Illinois, plotted a raid on a military facility where they intended on slaughtering 120 militia.
[00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:49.302]  A Yemeni-born, naturalized American pizza and chicken shop owner in Rochester, New York was allegedly funneling jihadist recruits to a Syrian welcoming camp for training.
[00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:56.986]  Gunmen Elton Simpson and Nadir Souf were shot dead by police attempting to storm Pamela Geller's Muhammad art exhibit in contest.
[00:02:56.986 --> 00:03:06.890]  Austin, Texas native, white Muslim convert Michael Todd Wolf was arrested at the George Bush International Intercontinental Airport traveling to fly to Syria to train with jihadists.
[00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.571]  Wolf was sentenced to seven years in prison.
[00:03:09.571 --> 00:03:19.416]  Self-described lone wolf for ISIS, Miguel Diaz, a 46-year-old convicted felon and Cuban immigrant, was jailed for 10 years in July on firearm charges.
[00:03:19.416 --> 00:03:30.021]  21-year-old American Christopher Cornell bought an arsenal which he planned to use to launch a terror assault on Washington, D.C., declaring his affiliation to ISIS during a jail cell TV interview.
[00:03:30.021 --> 00:03:34.243]  Earlier this year, Judicial Watch revealed that the Obama administration gave more than
[00:03:38.807 --> 00:03:47.814]  According to the government watchdog, the administration let 1,519 inadmissible foreigners embroiled in terrorism into the U.S.
[00:03:47.814 --> 00:03:52.058]  last year because the crimes were committed while under duress.
[00:03:52.058 --> 00:03:57.142]  Until Obama put the rubber stamp on bringing 10,000 Syrian refugees into the U.S.
[00:03:57.142 --> 00:04:02.427]  with no agreeable vetting process to weed out the jihadists, getting to America was difficult.
[00:04:03.347 --> 00:04:09.712]  This is the same group whose spokesperson is bragging that group could actually take over the United States of America.
[00:04:09.712 --> 00:04:14.915]  Have a listen for yourself.
[00:04:14.915 --> 00:04:23.021]  Now our president and the puppets of Europe are literally aiding and abetting a military invasion against their own citizens.
[00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:24.341]  John Bound for InfoWars.com
[00:04:25.771 --> 00:04:29.435]  Very powerful report, that's why I opened the transmission with that.
[00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:36.042]  The reason we're focusing on this so much, obviously, is because it shows the whole war on terror is a fraud.
[00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:40.847]  We end up attacking countries that haven't attacked us while aiding the very enemies that have sworn to destroy this country.
[00:04:42.614 --> 00:04:44.156]  Big broadcast coming up today.
[00:04:44.156 --> 00:04:50.121]  Incredible jam-packed with informative guests and our reporters in Paris, France.
[00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:51.302]  It's all coming up today.
[00:04:51.302 --> 00:04:57.748]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com and we are in the Situation Room, not the War Room today.
[00:04:57.748 --> 00:04:58.389]  Different studio.
[00:04:59.457 --> 00:05:04.779]  It's election season, a time where we'll soon find out who will be the leader of the free world.
[00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:14.202]  Well, in what appears to be a first for a serious presidential contender, Hillary Clinton's campaign is going after the Laugh Factory comedians for making fun of her.
[00:05:14.562 --> 00:05:23.226]  A short video of this performance is posted on the website of the renowned comedy club, Laugh Factory, and the Clinton campaign has tried to censor it.
[00:05:23.226 --> 00:05:31.670]  Besides demanding that the video be taken down, Clinton demanded the personal contact information of the performers that appear in the recording.
[00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.771]  So what was so crass?
[00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:36.112]  The Clinton campaign wants it taken down?
[00:05:36.112 --> 00:05:46.516]  Well, the skits make fun of Clinton's wardrobe, her age, sexual orientation, the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and the former first lady's relationship with her famous husband.
[00:05:46.516 --> 00:05:49.438]  Basically what we do here at InfoWars every single day.
[00:05:49.438 --> 00:05:56.501]  Now, if you want to watch this video for yourself, The Laugh Factory has appropriately titled it, Hillary vs. the First Amendment.

[00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:22.271]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:29.553]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.553 --> 00:08:38.795]  This is going to be another absolutely vital transmission.
[00:08:40.618 --> 00:08:50.996]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Thursday, November 19th, 2015 Global Transmission.
[00:08:50.996 --> 00:08:53.820]  Joining us today will be Joe Biggs.
[00:08:55.478 --> 00:09:00.080]  and other InfoWars.com reporters from Paris, France.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:12.706]  They will then travel to London, England to visit some of the ghettos that are no-go zones for Europeans and Westerners on Friday and Saturday before returning to the United States.
[00:09:12.706 --> 00:09:18.109]  Ahmad Saleem, the famous FBI informant,
[00:09:19.005 --> 00:09:31.416]  Who tried to stop the first World Trade Center attack, but was basically ordered to let it go forward before blowing the whistle, will be joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:09:31.416 --> 00:09:34.598]  And he is a top expert, and of course was a high-level military officer.
[00:09:34.598 --> 00:09:40.664]  What a colonel in the military in Egypt.
[00:09:41.974 --> 00:09:51.819]  Dr. Jerome Corsi will also be joining us to break down the global jihad and exactly why Obama thinks he can get away with opening our borders up and bringing in 100,000.
[00:09:51.819 --> 00:09:52.319]  First it was 10,000.
[00:09:52.319 --> 00:09:53.500]  Now it's 100,000.
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.681]  Now they're talking about 300,000.
[00:09:55.681 --> 00:09:58.682]  And if we accept that, it'll be 3 million.
[00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:01.404]  That is the same formula they've used in Europe.
[00:10:01.404 --> 00:10:02.664]  So that's all coming up today.
[00:10:02.664 --> 00:10:03.965]  And then Anthony Gucciardi.
[00:10:04.485 --> 00:10:18.318]  We'll be ably hosting the fourth hour and has a lot of breaking news and analysis that we'll be telling you about later when he hosts the fourth hour that we've added to the transmission because there's so much news.
[00:10:18.318 --> 00:10:21.882]  That said, just look at some of these headlines I've got in front of me.
[00:10:26.135 --> 00:10:27.096]  Exclusive!
[00:10:27.096 --> 00:10:34.006]  Six men from Pakistan, Afghanistan busted illegally entering Arizona from Mexico.
[00:10:34.006 --> 00:10:37.190]  And that is from Breitbart, Texas, Brandon Darby.
[00:10:38.291 --> 00:10:53.176]  Now remember, supposedly theories that any Islamists are coming across know, other than Mexicans, is what it's called by the Border Patrol, come in by the thousands per border state with Mexico per month.
[00:10:53.176 --> 00:10:57.538]  If you go and look at the numbers released by them, it will tell you the countries.
[00:10:57.538 --> 00:11:00.519]  Pakistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia,
[00:11:02.222 --> 00:11:11.505]  Jordan, Lebanon, and a lot of them are just looking for work, trying to get their families, but some of them are radical, some of them are planning terror attacks, and ISIS and others have planned to do that.
[00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:13.885]  So there's that report.
[00:11:13.885 --> 00:11:22.048]  Sixth Syrian with fake passport captured in Honduras on way to the United States.
[00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:26.269]  There is another report from Gateway Pundit.
[00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:27.149]  Here's another report.
[00:11:32.512 --> 00:11:38.215]  Throngs of children are trying to cross the Texas border again.
[00:11:38.215 --> 00:11:39.636]  And notice the strategy.
[00:11:39.636 --> 00:11:46.400]  Obama a few days ago said, oh, you're scared of women and widows and children blowing you up.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.163]  And then a woman suicide bomber blew herself up in a police dog in Paris yesterday.
[00:11:51.163 --> 00:11:54.865]  And our reporters were on scene just minutes after it happened.
[00:11:56.127 --> 00:11:56.347]  I think?
[00:12:13.186 --> 00:12:20.028]  And to Europe, these migrants are military-age men and are Wahhabist who failed in the takeover.
[00:12:20.028 --> 00:12:22.889]  They were there to get their own land, take over people's houses.
[00:12:22.889 --> 00:12:24.669]  That's what the jihadis do.
[00:12:24.669 --> 00:12:30.031]  They come in, they colonize, they run you out of your home, and they take it over.
[00:12:30.031 --> 00:12:31.391]  That's what's done in the Middle East.
[00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:33.912]  They usurp each other back and forth.
[00:12:33.912 --> 00:12:39.694]  And it is the Sunnis, traditionally, that are the main usurpers because they are the majority of Islam.
[00:12:41.276 --> 00:12:41.456]  79%.
[00:12:41.456 --> 00:12:43.497]  I'm not demonizing Sunnis.
[00:12:43.497 --> 00:12:47.438]  A lot of Sunnis aren't radical and are great people.
[00:12:47.438 --> 00:12:52.079]  It's a fact, though, that they're the ones quarterbacking the radical Islamic takeover worldwide.
[00:12:52.079 --> 00:12:54.740]  So there is that report.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.861]  Syrian community leader says ISIS is already in America.
[00:12:57.861 --> 00:12:59.242]  New York Post.
[00:12:59.242 --> 00:13:00.102]  Yeah, no kidding.
[00:13:00.102 --> 00:13:03.583]  It's not already in America.
[00:13:03.583 --> 00:13:04.703]  It is in America.
[00:13:04.703 --> 00:13:06.024]  It's been allowed into America.
[00:13:06.024 --> 00:13:10.485]  And now ISIS is threatening New York City in a new propaganda video.
[00:13:13.985 --> 00:13:39.768]  Now before I get into all of that, I want to tie it in to the fact that Obama thinks we're stupid and thinks that he can get away with bringing in unlimited radical Islamists and then when they attack military recruiting centers, when they attack community centers, when they attack
[00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:46.798]  Government facilities, they will just spin it and say it's not Islamic.
[00:13:46.798 --> 00:13:56.363]  And the dutiful CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN, MSNBC will all dutifully report that it's not Islamic, period.
[00:13:56.363 --> 00:14:01.145]  Just like the Fort Hood shooting they said was not radical Islamic behavior.
[00:14:01.145 --> 00:14:04.967]  When you kill 14 people screaming Allah Akbar, it is.
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:21.029]  But what they don't seem to take into account is the alternative media, that is the real media, already has bigger numbers put together in the overall aggregate, in the final sum, than dinosaur media.
[00:14:21.029 --> 00:14:24.251]  Dinosaur media is beyond its last legs.
[00:14:24.251 --> 00:14:30.175]  It is laying in the desert with labored breath about to go into history.
[00:14:31.766 --> 00:14:33.487]  And that brings me to this next outrage.
[00:14:33.487 --> 00:14:35.467]  Infowars.com.
[00:14:35.467 --> 00:14:42.249]  Obama plans to veto refugee screening bill despite terrorists having entered U.S.
[00:14:42.249 --> 00:14:44.870]  as refugees.
[00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:57.394]  The FBI, in more than a dozen states as you know in the last two days, has arrested 69 people with ties to ISIS who they report were planning attacks in this country.
[00:15:01.254 --> 00:15:12.719]  But Obama is coming out and has now ordered the FBI to come out today and say that there are no Islamic ISIS-connected cells in the United States.
[00:15:12.719 --> 00:15:23.944]  Well, we know there are ISIS training camps in the United States that were allowed to operate to train jihadis to send them to Syria, to Libya, and to Egypt and Iraq.
[00:15:23.944 --> 00:15:27.166]  That is on record, that they were allowed to recruit and do this.
[00:15:27.166 --> 00:15:29.787]  Now they've just flipped against the West
[00:15:31.294 --> 00:15:37.355]  And I don't know who's double-crossing who, but it is a mess.
[00:15:37.355 --> 00:15:48.258]  And if they ever act like borders could bring security, if they ever act like we deserve to have any screening process at all, then their whole fraud, that borders don't matter, collapses.
[00:15:48.258 --> 00:15:57.680]  So that's why they have to double down again, and double down on top of that, and then double down and double down again, and say there are no Islamic terrorists, there are no Islamic terror attacks,
[00:15:58.996 --> 00:16:01.978]  No one's gonna hurt you, nothing's happening.
[00:16:01.978 --> 00:16:09.343]  And while they've had Democrat Congresswomen, we talked about it yesterday, come out and say, we need to restrict guns because of Paris.
[00:16:09.343 --> 00:16:12.365]  See, it's the suspension of common sense.
[00:16:12.365 --> 00:16:17.509]  Paris has a gun ban like New York or Chicago or DC.
[00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:21.192]  Paris is one of the most restrictive gun-free zones in the world.
[00:16:21.192 --> 00:16:24.174]  And it's a hotbed of terror attacks because it's wide open.
[00:16:25.353 --> 00:16:32.715]  So how do you counter the answer to a threat like the head of Interpol said a few years ago when the Kenya shopping malls got attacked?
[00:16:32.715 --> 00:16:36.396]  He said, arm the citizens like they do in Texas or Colorado.
[00:16:36.396 --> 00:16:37.356]  That is the answer.
[00:16:37.356 --> 00:16:38.276]  That's the quote.
[00:16:38.276 --> 00:16:39.816]  ABC News.
[00:16:39.816 --> 00:16:46.438]  So when you've got common sense like that gaining ground, you just come out and say the answer is take everybody's guns away.
[00:16:47.762 --> 00:16:57.292]  Because an ISIS terrorist is going to follow the law and they're not going to attack anybody because there's a sign on the door saying it's a gun-free zone.
[00:16:57.292 --> 00:17:01.557]  And if you believe that, you believe the frosty weather that's hit part of the U.S.
[00:17:01.557 --> 00:17:04.160]  came from a little elf named Jack Frost.
[00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.312]  In fact, when we come back from break, I'm going to play this Congresswoman.
[00:17:10.312 --> 00:17:12.113]  But here is the outrage.
[00:17:12.113 --> 00:17:17.917]  Obama plans to veto refugee screening bill despite terrorists having entered the U.S.
[00:17:17.917 --> 00:17:19.077]  as refugees.
[00:17:19.077 --> 00:17:27.583]  President says legislation would create unnecessary and impractical requirements.
[00:17:27.583 --> 00:17:34.127]  And all it's saying is they've got to be vetted and screened and prove their passports are accurate and they don't have affiliations with known terror groups.
[00:17:34.127 --> 00:17:36.709]  It's not even proper screening.
[00:17:39.687 --> 00:17:55.697]  I mean, why would a country that's already got 40 million illegals in it, why would a country that's already going bankrupt want to take on people from a war-torn nation brimming with jihadis and military-age men and then not screen them with almost all the passports?
[00:17:55.697 --> 00:18:01.581]  They say five out of six is the EU's own statement a month ago.
[00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:06.884]  Five out of six Syrian passports are fake.
[00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:09.192]  Fake?
[00:18:09.192 --> 00:18:10.112]  Five?
[00:18:10.112 --> 00:18:11.813]  You've got a fake passport!
[00:18:11.813 --> 00:18:14.074]  You're not coming in!
[00:18:14.074 --> 00:18:36.646]  If I showed up, born in this country, born in Dallas, Texas, 41, almost 42 years ago, if I showed up to the United States border, flew in, say, to Austin, Texas, and I had a fake passport saying my name was John Brown, or my name was David Thompson, or my name was Bill Sanchez, whatever, John Doe,
[00:18:37.861 --> 00:18:42.785]  They would arrest me for fraud, and they should.
[00:18:42.785 --> 00:18:49.171]  But not if I'm an illegal alien from Latin America, or Africa, or the Middle East.
[00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:59.859]  It's bizarre, ladies and gentlemen, because they have all the security theater, how they've got to keep us safe, take all our rights away, because Al Qaeda's hiding under every bench, every bed, every closet, the boogeyman.
[00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:13.051]  You've got a real jihad army taking over part of Iraq, Syria, Libya, overthrew for a full year Egypt, our ally, our government backs these people.
[00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:13.432]  And now...
[00:19:14.554 --> 00:19:16.135]  We're told we're going to bring them in.
[00:19:16.135 --> 00:19:19.977]  It just shows the incredible boldness of this administration.
[00:19:19.977 --> 00:19:21.618]  I think they've gone too far.
[00:19:21.618 --> 00:19:23.780]  Obviously they've gone too far legally and lawfully.
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:24.900]  This is treason.
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.161]  This is sedition.
[00:19:26.161 --> 00:19:30.024]  This is a military act against this country by classical definitions.
[00:19:30.024 --> 00:19:32.165]  Again, that's not rhetoric.
[00:19:32.165 --> 00:19:38.469]  I don't have words that rise to the level of this outrageous miscarriage of sanity.
[00:19:40.762 --> 00:19:43.544]  But it's gone too far, even in the system.
[00:19:43.544 --> 00:19:45.865]  Even in this whored out, corrupt system.
[00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:49.327]  This blasted, dragged out system.
[00:19:49.327 --> 00:19:54.169]  This potholed, rotting, shot system.
[00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:55.770]  This is too much.
[00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.892]  Because it puts the whole security theater on trial.
[00:19:59.744 --> 00:20:03.045]  My name is Bill Bonner and I have an important message.
[00:20:03.045 --> 00:20:08.547]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[00:20:08.547 --> 00:20:10.827]  But they're about to lose control.
[00:20:10.827 --> 00:20:15.769]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[00:20:16.129 --> 00:20:20.712]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:20:20.712 --> 00:20:23.113]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:20:23.113 --> 00:20:26.955]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[00:20:26.955 --> 00:20:30.377]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[00:20:30.377 --> 00:20:31.478]  And they did.
[00:20:31.478 --> 00:20:34.600]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.181]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:20:37.181 --> 00:20:38.542]  This will affect us all.
[00:20:39.042 --> 00:20:43.766]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[00:20:43.766 --> 00:20:50.152]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.

[00:23:56.666 --> 00:23:57.467]  Come and take it.
[00:24:12.858 --> 00:24:23.343]  I hurt myself today to see if I still feel.
[00:24:23.343 --> 00:24:28.085]  I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real.
[00:24:28.752 --> 00:24:35.977]  Folks ask why I have such high energy and why I tend to get on the edge of the stereo.
[00:24:35.977 --> 00:24:50.126]  It's crazy to have the President of the United States saying they're going to bring in 100,000 now, quote, refugees from an Al-Qaeda offensive area.
[00:24:50.126 --> 00:24:57.391]  And almost all of them, it turns out, are Sunnis that came into Syria to take over and have now failed and have nowhere to go.
[00:25:00.862 --> 00:25:10.185]  These are like pilgrims, you know, on the wagon trains going west, wanting to take over land, basically.
[00:25:10.185 --> 00:25:12.245]  And they're almost all military-age men.
[00:25:12.245 --> 00:25:13.226]  That is admitted.
[00:25:13.226 --> 00:25:22.288]  And I just cannot believe how bold this illegitimate government is, at the top, pulling stuff like this.
[00:25:22.288 --> 00:25:24.009]  I mean, I can't even believe it.
[00:25:25.697 --> 00:25:37.122]  And they just caught six men from Pakistan, Afghanistan busing illegally entering Arizona from Mexico.
[00:25:37.122 --> 00:25:40.423]  And Breitbart, Texas does have a lot of really good sources.
[00:25:40.423 --> 00:25:50.747]  We have sources inside the Border Patrol that told us to go down, obviously, last year and show where they bring the illegals in, give them the vouchers, and then bus them into the country.
[00:25:52.278 --> 00:25:53.999]  But at least that's Latin Americans.
[00:25:53.999 --> 00:25:59.001]  Most of them aren't criminals or terrorists.
[00:25:59.001 --> 00:26:01.702]  A highly trusted federal agent working under the umbrella of U.S.
[00:26:01.702 --> 00:26:10.185]  Customs and Border Protection has confirmed to Breitbart Texas that a group comprised of five Pakistan men and one from Afghanistan was captured by U.S.
[00:26:10.185 --> 00:26:16.928]  Border Patrol agents after having illegally crossed the porous U.S.-Mexico border in the Tucson sector of Arizona.
[00:26:17.671 --> 00:26:28.517]  The six men traveling in a group were captured roughly 16 miles into the state of Arizona, specifically near the small, picturesque town of Patagonia, Arizona.
[00:26:28.517 --> 00:26:33.080]  The apprehension of the group occurred late on Monday night, November 16, 2015.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:40.944]  Border Patrol agents were unable to do extensive interviews with the six Middle Eastern men because the Federal Bureau of Investigation took over the matter.
[00:26:40.944 --> 00:26:44.827]  The aliens were immediately transferred to Tucson, where the FBI took custody.
[00:26:44.827 --> 00:26:46.588]  And there's just nothing else really known about that.
[00:26:48.012 --> 00:26:49.033]  And this is ongoing.
[00:26:49.033 --> 00:27:04.786]  If you look, because they only release it every few months, the latest numbers on who's been apprehended and what, and it'll say, you know, 27,000 Mexicans in this sector, 3,000, I mean, I'm going from just, just stalled memory, Guatemalans, 1,200 Venezuelans.
[00:27:04.786 --> 00:27:07.288]  It'll say, and then it'll say 127 Pakistanis, you know, 24 Syrians.
[00:27:07.288 --> 00:27:09.390]  It just, it says the numbers.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:25.322]  John Kerry again is in NBC News saying accept 85,000 refugees in 2016, 100,000 in 2017.
[00:27:25.322 --> 00:27:28.203]  So the number's always growing.
[00:27:28.203 --> 00:27:32.985]  Now they're talking about 300,000, see?
[00:27:32.985 --> 00:27:36.746]  But then they keep using this 10,000 number in the news to confuse everybody.
[00:27:36.746 --> 00:27:38.767]  That's how they started four or five years ago in Germany.
[00:27:38.767 --> 00:27:41.588]  They go, we're gonna take 10,000 refugees.
[00:27:41.588 --> 00:27:46.630]  Next it's 100,000, 300,000, a million, two million, three million plus now in Germany.
[00:27:47.552 --> 00:27:50.255]  Three million in the last four years.
[00:27:50.255 --> 00:27:54.258]  Now they're talking about three million in the next two years!
[00:27:54.258 --> 00:27:54.999]  In Germany!
[00:27:54.999 --> 00:28:03.127]  There's only 60 million people in both countries, when it was East and West.
[00:28:03.127 --> 00:28:05.970]  So it really is incredible.
[00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:12.175]  And I just ask her by the question, how will the establishment get away with this when there are terror attacks in this country?
[00:28:12.921 --> 00:28:13.741]  What are they planning?
[00:28:13.741 --> 00:28:20.544]  Well, they're going to use the threat to build up this big apparatus of security that's then focused on the American people.
[00:28:20.544 --> 00:28:22.605]  And I said I'd play the clip.
[00:28:22.605 --> 00:28:34.290]  We do have the clip of this Congresswoman yesterday coming out and saying that we need to restrict the Second Amendment because
[00:28:36.072 --> 00:28:37.733]  Of what happened in Paris, here it is.
[00:28:37.733 --> 00:28:58.529]  But I do want to remind you that before we killed a jihadist named Awlaki, he did a video that said to Americans, join the jihad and get guns because it's so easy in the United States of America to get a weapon.
[00:28:58.529 --> 00:29:05.174]  And that ought to be a chilling reminder because aside from blowing themselves up, which is
[00:29:07.098 --> 00:29:09.119]  Of course, not about small weapons.
[00:29:09.119 --> 00:29:16.482]  These people use the kinds of weapons that are still available in the United States of America.
[00:29:16.482 --> 00:29:24.824]  And I think it ought to cause us to have another consideration of sensible gun safety laws.
[00:29:24.824 --> 00:29:28.526]  Well, that's Jan Schakowsky from Illinois.
[00:29:28.526 --> 00:29:31.847]  Yeah, they had illegal plastic explosives too, Bimbo.
[00:29:33.513 --> 00:29:36.315]  And you've got armed guards protecting you, you little slime bag!
[00:29:36.315 --> 00:29:39.318]  It was a gun-free zone where they attacked!
[00:29:39.318 --> 00:29:40.038]  You monster!
[00:29:40.038 --> 00:29:45.403]  Those sycophilts like you and these people are anti-American trash!
[00:29:45.403 --> 00:29:50.607]  Who wants to disarm her quarry, her would-be slaves?
[00:29:50.607 --> 00:29:53.529]  Predators want their slaves disarmed.
[00:29:53.529 --> 00:29:56.552]  Predators want to feed on declawed prey.
[00:29:59.383 --> 00:30:05.886]  While the government claims the tetanus vaccine is perfectly safe, the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association disagrees.
[00:30:05.886 --> 00:30:16.450]  They're charging UNICEF and the World Health Organization with sterilizing millions of girls and women under cover of an anti-tetanus vaccination program sponsored by the Kenyan government.
[00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:20.932]  The association had six tetanus vaccinations from around Kenya tested.
[00:30:20.932 --> 00:30:24.814]  100% of them tested positive for the HCG antigen.
[00:30:25.174 --> 00:30:34.102]  HCG is a pregnancy hormone developed by the World Health Organization in 1992, and it's commonly used in anti-fertility vaccines.
[00:30:34.102 --> 00:30:52.317]  A spokesman for the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association said this proved right our worst fears, that this World Health Organization campaign is not about eradicating neonatal tetanus, but a well-coordinated, forceful population control mass sterilization exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine.

[00:31:55.254 --> 00:31:57.076]  Secret 12 InfoWarsLife's Vitamin B12 Formulation.
[00:32:02.939 --> 00:32:09.246]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:32:09.246 --> 00:32:16.534]  That's why, for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.

[00:32:31.804 --> 00:32:36.626]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.

[00:32:54.451 --> 00:33:02.137]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.276 --> 00:33:31.399]  We wouldn't admit three-year-old orphans.
[00:33:31.399 --> 00:33:36.282]  That's political posturing.
[00:33:36.282 --> 00:33:46.628]  When individuals say that we should have a religious test and that only Christians, proven Christians, should be admitted.
[00:33:46.628 --> 00:33:52.031]  That's offensive and contrary to American values.
[00:33:52.031 --> 00:33:54.453]  I cannot think of a more
[00:33:57.674 --> 00:33:58.414]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:33:58.414 --> 00:34:02.016]  Everything Obama says is a lie.
[00:34:20.233 --> 00:34:22.154]  That we're against widows and three-year-olds.
[00:34:22.154 --> 00:34:29.317]  No, we were against turning women into widows and driving three-year-olds out of Syria, but that's not who's coming over.
[00:34:29.317 --> 00:34:36.640]  It's men that want jobs, it's men that want welfare, it's men that want brides.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:44.264]  Many of them, a large minority of them, are jihadis that failed in the takeover of Syria and are now being allowed into Turkey
[00:34:45.478 --> 00:34:51.862]  North of Syria, and then they're allowed to infiltrate and march in giant columns by the hundreds of thousands.
[00:34:51.862 --> 00:34:56.245]  Incredible footage that everyone's seen into Europe.
[00:34:56.245 --> 00:34:59.848]  And Germans are told you'll be arrested if you criticize it.
[00:34:59.848 --> 00:35:10.775]  And within hours of Obama saying, you know, you're scared of women, a woman blew herself up and blew a police dog up and shrapnel flew into the police vehicles nearby.
[00:35:15.984 --> 00:35:20.747]  And then he goes on to say he can't think of a better recruiting tool for ISIS.
[00:35:20.747 --> 00:35:33.897]  When the West funded ISIS, 90 plus percent of the rebels are Wahhabist, Al-Nusra, Al-Qaeda, ISIS, same group.
[00:35:33.897 --> 00:35:39.241]  ISIS is the worldwide caliphate recruiting arm establishing Islamic states.
[00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:49.296]  IS is the Islamic State they're setting up with an area between Eastern Syria and Western Iraq.
[00:35:49.296 --> 00:36:01.546]  And the public is so incredibly politically uninformed and geopolitically uninformed about what's going on in the world that they get confused by it.
[00:36:01.546 --> 00:36:07.331]  Former DIA director, US made willful decision to support ISIS in Syria.
[00:36:09.892 --> 00:36:22.098]  That was former top general, on record, General Michael Flynn.
[00:36:22.098 --> 00:36:26.020]  Should I play the clip again?
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:34.025]  And by the way, I'm not a fan of a lot of the stuff that comes out of the moodles in Iran, but I'm not for war with Iran, and Iran is not attacking this country.
[00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:36.706]  They're the Shiites that are fighting.
[00:36:38.749 --> 00:36:46.599]  The Shiites believe you've got to be genetically descended from Muhammad, the prophet, to be able to be a cleric.
[00:36:46.599 --> 00:36:51.105]  Obviously, that's not going to take over Islam, even though it's arguably the oldest form of Islam.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:37:01.822]  The Sunnis say, no, you've just got to profess it and be recognized by the people as a spiritual leader.
[00:37:01.822 --> 00:37:14.046]  That's why they're the majority of Islam, because there's going to be a lot more preachers out there pushing their brand of Islam because they can say that they're a Mahdi, or a leader, or a spiritual man, because according to the Shiites, you've got to be related to Muhammad.
[00:37:16.291 --> 00:37:19.533]  And that's the big fight in Islam, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:19.533 --> 00:37:23.376]  And the average American doesn't even know what that is.
[00:37:23.376 --> 00:37:27.639]  And that's what the politicians prey on all day long.
[00:37:27.639 --> 00:37:35.745]  And now, the Supreme Leader of Iran, the Ayatollah of Rock and Rolla,
[00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:49.818]  has come out and said that the West was behind the terror attacks and the media spun that to say that he was saying it was completely staged.
[00:37:49.818 --> 00:37:53.641]  Video from Iran's Supreme Leader reportedly blames US for Paris attacks.
[00:37:54.341 --> 00:38:03.647]  But when you read deeper, he says the West funded Islamic State to overthrow Shiite-controlled areas of the world, and now it's blowing back on them.
[00:38:03.647 --> 00:38:04.808]  And it's a true statement.
[00:38:04.808 --> 00:38:06.389]  WikiLeaks said the same thing.
[00:38:06.389 --> 00:38:07.710]  They got demonized.
[00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:08.951]  It's true!
[00:38:08.951 --> 00:38:09.772]  It's true!
[00:38:09.772 --> 00:38:11.593]  I don't care who says it.
[00:38:11.593 --> 00:38:13.674]  If Bill Clinton said it, it'd be true.
[00:38:13.674 --> 00:38:14.575]  Even though he's a liar.
[00:38:17.756 --> 00:38:28.443]  The video posted on Facebook page affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps was first reported by the Middle East Media Research Institute.
[00:38:28.443 --> 00:38:29.483]  It explains that the U.S.
[00:38:29.483 --> 00:38:32.025]  created the Islamic State to advance its own agenda.
[00:38:32.025 --> 00:38:35.207]  That's what the general over DIA said.
[00:38:35.207 --> 00:38:36.308]  It's just true!
[00:38:36.308 --> 00:38:42.572]  And see, the Ayatollah's not bad for saying it, our government's bad for doing it!
[00:38:44.782 --> 00:38:55.493]  You got these 9-11 truthers out there that will look at me and say, I am not covering the full story because I'm not saying it's all completely manufactured.
[00:38:55.493 --> 00:39:06.845]  Because it's not all manufactured at the ground level, but it was manufactured at the beginning because they created the group, funded the group, protected the group.
[00:39:08.635 --> 00:39:10.195]  So it is a false flag.
[00:39:10.195 --> 00:39:13.716]  But I'm explaining the type of false flag it is.
[00:39:13.716 --> 00:39:15.317]  I said ISIS was coming.
[00:39:15.317 --> 00:39:16.517]  I said they were real.
[00:39:16.517 --> 00:39:18.497]  I said get ready for major attacks.
[00:39:18.497 --> 00:39:20.538]  Because I've been analyzing the group.
[00:39:20.538 --> 00:39:22.178]  I've seen them on the ground.
[00:39:22.178 --> 00:39:25.919]  We've been threatened by them over and over again.
[00:39:25.919 --> 00:39:29.700]  I watched them be allowed to recruit online.
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:33.761]  And they're now going to use this threat to take our freedoms.
[00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:35.501]  There is purely staged terror.
[00:39:35.501 --> 00:39:36.842]  There is manufactured terror.
[00:39:36.842 --> 00:39:37.982]  There's provocateur terror.
[00:39:39.244 --> 00:39:45.789]  There is finance terror, where it's real terror groups, but they got their money up the chain from shadowy corporations.
[00:39:45.789 --> 00:39:52.454]  I've made my mission to study this, and that's why we're getting into these areas.
[00:39:52.454 --> 00:40:00.540]  But it is a real threat, but yes, the door was opened to these organizations to come into the West.
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:07.145]  But it's worse than that, because our criminal governments, the illegitimate groups that have hijacked our nation and hijacked Europe,
[00:40:07.987 --> 00:40:17.284]  have been financing and funding these groups so they helped finance fund and protect and shepherd them and now they're opening the door for them joining us with his final report
[00:40:18.697 --> 00:40:22.340]  From Paris, France, he's got new news of chemical weapons threats.
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:27.104]  We know ISIS and Al-Qaeda do have chemical weapons, at least in Syria and other areas.
[00:40:27.104 --> 00:40:28.385]  They got it from Saudi Arabia.
[00:40:28.385 --> 00:40:31.428]  Even the UN had that finding.
[00:40:31.428 --> 00:40:38.553]  And he's got more intel for us before he goes to London to report with Paul Watson and, of course, Michael Zimmerman.
[00:40:38.553 --> 00:40:44.118]  So joining us from Paris, France, is former Army Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs.
[00:40:44.118 --> 00:40:45.019]  Joe, what's the latest?
[00:40:46.167 --> 00:40:47.868]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[00:40:47.868 --> 00:40:49.749]  Now we're in downtown Paris.
[00:40:49.749 --> 00:40:56.433]  And to go back to what you're talking about with social media, how ISIS was being allowed to recruit, I mean, it's amazing.
[00:40:56.433 --> 00:41:05.198]  If you or I, we get on there, we say something that's discriminatory, so-called racist or anti-immigration, we can be censored.
[00:41:05.198 --> 00:41:13.023]  Meanwhile, these guys have been left to just get on Twitter openly recruiting, posting these stuff, and they don't go after them.
[00:41:13.459 --> 00:41:20.022]  You know, if I post something saying something, say if I said something about Hillary Clinton, the FBI is going to be knocking at my door.
[00:41:20.022 --> 00:41:22.462]  But there's nothing going on with these guys.
[00:41:22.462 --> 00:41:31.946]  You know, today we found out the French Prime Minister said that there is a great possibility of a chemical attack here in Paris.
[00:41:31.946 --> 00:41:36.868]  And I'm trying to wonder, you know, I'm trying to figure out where that idea came from.
[00:41:36.868 --> 00:41:41.330]  And I think this comes from possibly the raid yesterday in St.
[00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:42.030]  Charles, where
[00:41:42.768 --> 00:41:43.148]  Or St.
[00:41:43.148 --> 00:41:46.432]  Dennis, where the police went into that building and raided it.
[00:41:46.432 --> 00:41:53.759]  Now they said when they, the initial report is when they went in there, they found evidence of another attack being prepared for.
[00:41:53.759 --> 00:41:57.402]  Now did they find some kind of chemical stuff in there that they were working on?
[00:41:57.402 --> 00:41:59.284]  Different kinds of vests, something like that.
[00:41:59.284 --> 00:42:02.948]  So that's where I'm beginning to think maybe that intel came from.
[00:42:04.229 --> 00:42:09.332]  Well obviously that's where the mastermind was and was reportedly killed as you first reported yesterday.
[00:42:09.332 --> 00:42:19.577]  It's now been confirmed today that they're saying the mastermind of the Paris attacks of Halloween or of Friday the 13th was indeed killed.
[00:42:19.577 --> 00:42:26.380]  Speaking of Halloween, the Russians have come out obviously yesterday confirming that that was a two-pound bomb on board that aircraft.
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.461]  ISIS did take responsibility for that.
[00:42:28.461 --> 00:42:30.182]  The point is they're on the march
[00:42:30.842 --> 00:42:39.650]  And as you know, Al Qaeda slash IS has launched multiple chemical attacks inside Syria and attempted to blame it on Assad.
[00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:42.072]  So there's no telling what they're going to pull.
[00:42:42.072 --> 00:42:46.796]  Well, the lady who had the suicide vest strapped to herself in St.
[00:42:46.796 --> 00:42:49.498]  Denis during the raid, she actually was
[00:42:50.353 --> 00:42:57.660]  Going up to the window and looking out as they saw the police coming and screaming, help me, help me to lure them in to try to get them in there.
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.642]  And instead of falling for it, I guess they sent the police dog in.
[00:43:00.642 --> 00:43:07.829]  They said when that vest went off that it was such a big explosion that the floor that she was standing on collapsed and fell through.
[00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:12.033]  And the explosion was so great that it sent her spine across into the street.
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:35.169]  Joe, being inside the middle of the epicenter of the ISIS Jihad, and traveling to Brussels, Belgium, and being thrown out by the Islamists that didn't want you in the area, what's your overall takeaway after being on the ground for five days?
[00:43:36.598 --> 00:43:48.001]  Well, you know, I go back to the article I read right before we came over here that Paul Joseph Watson put up, saying that about, I think it was 27% of Parisians actually support ISIS.
[00:43:48.001 --> 00:43:50.842]  And I'm sitting here thinking, that's far-fetched.
[00:43:50.842 --> 00:43:54.102]  Those aren't Parisians, those are invaders!
[00:43:54.102 --> 00:44:02.125]  And I'm sitting here thinking that's so far-fetched, but now that I've actually been here, I 100% believe that to the T, I can tell you this much.
[00:44:02.125 --> 00:44:03.245]  And let's go back to July 7th.
[00:44:04.289 --> 00:44:05.950]  Here in France, I found this story.
[00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:06.650]  I forgot about it.
[00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:08.631]  I actually read about it back when it happened.
[00:44:08.631 --> 00:44:14.855]  40 grenades, 180 detonators, and plastic explosives stolen from French military base.
[00:44:14.855 --> 00:44:16.796]  This is an article at the Telegraph.
[00:44:16.796 --> 00:44:20.377]  So, that stuff went missing back there, you know, back in July.
[00:44:20.377 --> 00:44:23.619]  No telling how that's been, you know, being used.
[00:44:23.619 --> 00:44:27.201]  If it's being sent over into Syria, Iraq, here in France.
[00:44:27.201 --> 00:44:29.062]  So, there's definitely that out there.
[00:44:29.062 --> 00:44:31.083]  That stuff has been stolen and someone is using it.
[00:44:34.089 --> 00:44:37.001]  Joe, I keep asking this question and I'm going to ask you again.
[00:44:39.637 --> 00:44:46.843]  How do you think they're going to get away when there's clearly more terror attacks in Europe, in the United States, in other Western nations?
[00:44:46.843 --> 00:44:49.985]  How will they politically get away with that unscathed?
[00:44:49.985 --> 00:44:54.248]  The socialists, the collectives, the Merkels, the Obamas, the Hollands.
[00:44:54.248 --> 00:45:00.213]  Just today, Obama plans to veto a refugee screening bill despite terrorists having entered the U.S.
[00:45:00.213 --> 00:45:00.853]  as refugees.
[00:45:00.853 --> 00:45:05.817]  The President says legislation would create unnecessary and impractical requirements.
[00:45:05.817 --> 00:45:06.838]  The definition
[00:45:07.498 --> 00:45:07.778]  I don't
[00:45:22.415 --> 00:45:23.015]  That's our country.
[00:45:23.015 --> 00:45:32.638]  I mean, from shutting down our power plants, to bringing in jihadis, to attacking our families, to funding ISIS, Obama really is trying to destroy this country.
[00:45:32.638 --> 00:45:36.839]  He really is trying to sabotage this nation.
[00:45:36.839 --> 00:45:42.080]  He really does want to destroy the country that gives him all his power.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.941]  I mean, these people are mentally ill.
[00:45:43.941 --> 00:45:46.661]  He is worse than I ever thought he could be.
[00:45:46.661 --> 00:45:48.702]  I mean, this is joke level, Biggs.
[00:45:49.554 --> 00:45:56.341]  Yeah, I mean they're pushing this entire PC culture to where it's almost like they want everyone to have this...
[00:45:56.923 --> 00:45:57.343]  I don't know.
[00:46:27.626 --> 00:46:28.826]  Horrible for doing it.
[00:46:28.826 --> 00:46:29.987]  And it's the same thing with that.
[00:46:29.987 --> 00:46:31.467]  I just don't understand it.
[00:46:31.467 --> 00:46:34.567]  And so many people are falling for it around the world.
[00:46:34.567 --> 00:46:35.728]  It's not just in America.
[00:46:35.728 --> 00:46:37.668]  It is everywhere.
[00:46:37.668 --> 00:46:41.129]  People are writing articles saying that, you know, you should sympathize for these people.
[00:46:41.129 --> 00:46:42.729]  Madonna says we should love them.
[00:46:42.729 --> 00:46:46.930]  Look, these people are bullies that oppress their own people in their own nations.
[00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:47.610]  It's sickening.
[00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:50.591]  But what's behind a lot of the guilt with the grassroots
[00:46:51.594 --> 00:46:54.977]  is we know attacking Iraq was wrong now.
[00:46:54.977 --> 00:46:57.698]  You've said that yourself and you were there and were wounded there.
[00:46:57.698 --> 00:46:59.019]  We know we were fed lies.
[00:46:59.019 --> 00:47:01.241]  We know we've done a lot of bad things to the Middle East.
[00:47:01.241 --> 00:47:03.102]  But here's the problem.
[00:47:03.102 --> 00:47:16.311]  The very globalists, the very New World Order people that lied to us into all these wars to destabilize the Middle East and set the stage for ISIS to come into the vacuum are the ones now saying open our borders.
[00:47:16.311 --> 00:47:17.352]  It's the globalists.
[00:47:17.352 --> 00:47:18.213]  They're the problem.
[00:47:19.568 --> 00:47:20.888]  Well, I have some breaking news right now.
[00:47:20.888 --> 00:47:26.370]  There's actually a raid being conducted by French police in Charville-Mazuray.
[00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:31.171]  It is a town that is about three hours away from here on the Belgian border.
[00:47:31.171 --> 00:47:36.193]  And right now, there are police conducting this raid, sweeping through, looking for possible terrorists.
[00:47:36.193 --> 00:47:37.193]  So that's going on right now.
[00:47:37.193 --> 00:47:40.254]  I actually have a link just posted on Facebook, on my Twitter and all that.
[00:47:40.254 --> 00:47:41.074]  You guys can grab it.
[00:47:41.074 --> 00:47:43.915]  It has live updates of what's going on from that area.
[00:47:43.915 --> 00:47:46.096]  Tell folks on Twitter, that's Rambo Beggs.
[00:47:46.792 --> 00:47:48.373]  Yes, at Rambo Biggs.
[00:47:48.373 --> 00:47:52.954]  And be sure to retweet that at the real Alex Jones there on Twitter as well.
[00:47:52.954 --> 00:47:58.817]  I don't want to say exactly what you're planning next, but you're going to go to London in the next day or so.
[00:47:58.817 --> 00:48:07.040]  You're also going to be going to some of these no-go ghettos where women are told you must not wear skirts, you must wear hoods.
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:09.361]  They even tell people not to come out of bars.
[00:48:10.101 --> 00:48:10.642]  I mean, the fact that
[00:48:29.204 --> 00:48:33.729]  I mean, I can believe that people don't want to accept that.
[00:48:33.729 --> 00:48:38.173]  That's fine, but I mean, I'm telling you, myself, Michael, and Paul were there.
[00:48:38.173 --> 00:48:39.655]  That happened, without a doubt.
[00:48:40.302 --> 00:48:41.243]  We had no problem.
[00:48:41.243 --> 00:48:45.265]  We're in front of the building where that raid was conducted because it's in a very open area.
[00:48:45.265 --> 00:48:50.028]  But once we walked further into the ghetto and started moving around through there, that's when the cars started coming by.
[00:48:50.028 --> 00:48:55.472]  That's when the people started hanging out and screaming like spit coming out of their mouth, angry that we're there.
[00:48:55.472 --> 00:48:56.713]  And then I was kind of wigged out.
[00:48:56.713 --> 00:49:00.235]  So we're like, all right, let's go into this restaurant and try to like get away from this for a minute.
[00:49:00.235 --> 00:49:05.038]  And as soon as we opened the door, this guy comes scooting in and kind of grabs the door and goes, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:49:05.038 --> 00:49:05.618]  You can't be here.
[00:49:05.618 --> 00:49:06.259]  You can't be here.
[00:49:07.071 --> 00:49:13.653]  Oh, but there's not going to be any liberal lawsuit because you're white or you're Western or you're Christian so you weren't let in.
[00:49:13.653 --> 00:49:15.974]  This is the suicide of the West.
[00:49:15.974 --> 00:49:17.315]  Well, it's been documented.
[00:49:17.315 --> 00:49:18.875]  You're going to document it some more.
[00:49:18.875 --> 00:49:23.537]  Joe Beggs, we'll continue to see your reports as you file them at InfoWars.com.
[00:49:23.537 --> 00:49:27.038]  We'll also have you back live tomorrow from London.
[00:49:27.038 --> 00:49:28.999]  You guys be safe.
[00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:31.780]  We went to Charlie Hebdo today too as well, Alex.
[00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:32.800]  And that's been filed as well?
[00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:39.975]  Um, we're putting it together for a nice produced report, but we actually went to the area where the police officer was killed on the sidewalk.
[00:49:39.975 --> 00:49:42.057]  There was a lot of people saying that was a hoax.
[00:49:42.057 --> 00:49:47.763]  You could actually see a little rut, like a divot, in the concrete where it looked like a bullet had hit as well.
[00:49:47.763 --> 00:49:49.645]  So we documented all that.
[00:49:49.645 --> 00:49:52.988]  The bottom floor of Charlie Hebdo has been completely cleaned out.
[00:49:52.988 --> 00:49:54.490]  It looks like they've moved up further.
[00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:59.674]  A lot of signs everywhere and we were able to go in and get closer to the Bataclan Theater today.
[00:49:59.674 --> 00:50:05.979]  They moved back the barricade, or actually I should say they brought it in closer just around that area instead of a huge block.
[00:50:05.979 --> 00:50:17.329]  They still have the memorials out as well, but you could see the signs up from last Friday saying that the Eagles of Death Metal, the American band that has the frontman for Queens of the Stone Age, they had all that still up there.
[00:50:17.329 --> 00:50:18.270]  A lot of people out there.
[00:50:18.681 --> 00:50:21.804]  Scared, worried, now we have the threats of the chemical attacks.
[00:50:21.804 --> 00:50:23.085]  So everybody's on edge here.
[00:50:23.085 --> 00:50:31.413]  I went out last night and actually spoke to a man from Paris who lived in Australia for a lot of his life and moved back here about five years ago.
[00:50:31.413 --> 00:50:37.359]  And he said he was actually supposed to go to that theater that night, that him and his wife had tickets.
[00:50:37.359 --> 00:50:42.624]  And he decided last minute that morning to go to Amsterdam and party there.
[00:50:43.284 --> 00:50:47.729]  So he never updated his family, he had never updated his work, that he had changed his plans.
[00:50:47.729 --> 00:50:51.834]  He gets a call from his boss screaming and crying saying, hey are you alive, are you alive?
[00:50:51.834 --> 00:50:53.836]  And he goes, yeah mate, I'm in Amsterdam.
[00:50:53.836 --> 00:50:54.277]  Wow.
[00:50:54.277 --> 00:50:55.218]  And he goes, thank God.
[00:50:55.218 --> 00:50:58.742]  Great job Joe, can't wait to see those reports at infowares.com.
[00:51:02.202 --> 00:51:06.823]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[00:51:06.823 --> 00:51:11.104]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[00:51:11.104 --> 00:51:12.484]  We typically do the same thing.
[00:51:12.484 --> 00:51:15.524]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[00:51:15.524 --> 00:51:17.725]  But have you considered heat storage?
[00:51:17.725 --> 00:51:19.945]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[00:51:19.945 --> 00:51:22.225]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[00:51:22.225 --> 00:51:23.866]  How will I keep my family warm?
[00:51:23.866 --> 00:51:26.346]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[00:51:26.346 --> 00:51:30.407]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[00:51:31.247 --> 00:51:32.348]  Another concern?
[00:51:32.348 --> 00:51:36.330]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:38.932]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[00:51:38.932 --> 00:51:42.895]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[00:51:42.895 --> 00:51:45.717]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[00:51:45.717 --> 00:51:50.360]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:52.361]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[00:51:52.361 --> 00:51:54.002]  FortressClothing.com.
[00:51:54.002 --> 00:51:55.343]  You'll never be cold again.
[00:51:59.201 --> 00:52:04.826]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:52:04.826 --> 00:52:19.277]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and infuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:52:19.437 --> 00:52:27.445]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:52:27.445 --> 00:52:33.010]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:36.573]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:52:36.573 --> 00:52:40.677]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:52:40.677 --> 00:52:44.541]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:52:44.881 --> 00:52:49.008]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.
[00:52:49.008 --> 00:52:54.097]  Secure your Liver Shield today exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com for the lowest price available.

[00:53:00.014 --> 00:53:05.677]  The lining of your lungs is supposed to be protected with glutathione to neutralize incoming irritants.
[00:53:05.677 --> 00:53:09.359]  In the absence of enough glutathione, your lungs are more prone to irritation.
[00:53:09.359 --> 00:53:13.601]  Listen to the real-world results of one man using a powerful glutathione-supporting food.
[00:53:13.601 --> 00:53:15.682]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien.
[00:53:15.682 --> 00:53:18.884]  I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation.
[00:53:18.884 --> 00:53:22.105]  My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[00:53:22.105 --> 00:53:27.328]  After consuming One World Weight today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[00:53:28.081 --> 00:53:34.706]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen, which is pretty remarkable because I rarely get that feeling.
[00:53:34.706 --> 00:53:37.508]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice.
[00:53:37.508 --> 00:53:41.031]  The only thing I know I've actually added to my routine is One World Way.
[00:53:41.031 --> 00:53:41.751]  Wow!
[00:53:41.751 --> 00:53:42.232]  Call 888-988-3325.
[00:53:42.232 --> 00:53:42.432]  That's 888-988-3325.

[00:53:43.512 --> 00:53:44.293]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:05.784]  Here's some of the headlines at DrugsReport.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:54:05.784 --> 00:54:07.605]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:54:07.605 --> 00:54:11.809]  Six Syrians with fake passports captured in Honduras.
[00:54:11.809 --> 00:54:14.772]  Now Costa Rica detains Syrian traveling on Greek passport.
[00:54:14.772 --> 00:54:17.654]  ISIS threatens New York City in new propaganda video.
[00:54:17.654 --> 00:54:18.896]  Times Square attack.
[00:54:18.896 --> 00:54:19.957]  Syrian community leader.
[00:54:19.957 --> 00:54:21.738]  ISIS already in USA.
[00:54:21.738 --> 00:54:23.300]  Refugees cannot be vetted.
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:25.602]  Get real, says the government.
[00:54:26.857 --> 00:54:29.938]  And it just goes on from that point on.
[00:54:29.938 --> 00:54:34.600]  Six men from Pakistan, Afghanistan busted entering Arizona.
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:38.961]  Al Qaeda uses refugee program to smuggle operatives into Kentucky.
[00:54:38.961 --> 00:54:42.763]  Report 827 Somalis resettled in six weeks.
[00:54:42.763 --> 00:54:44.423]  Only one Christian.
[00:54:44.423 --> 00:54:48.885]  I love how Obama says it's discriminatory to try to bring Christians in.
[00:54:48.885 --> 00:54:51.106]  That's the point of refugee status.
[00:54:51.866 --> 00:54:55.787]  Christians, the UN admits, are the most persecuted group in the world.
[00:54:55.787 --> 00:54:59.929]  Their persecution in the last decade has doubled.
[00:54:59.929 --> 00:55:02.930]  They're being murdered all over the Middle East.
[00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:07.412]  And Obama knows how dumb his politically correct audience is.
[00:55:07.412 --> 00:55:10.893]  And he goes, we can't just bring Christians in, that's discriminatory.
[00:55:10.893 --> 00:55:11.753]  No, we know!
[00:55:11.753 --> 00:55:17.215]  You won't let Christians get out!
[00:55:17.215 --> 00:55:18.736]  It is so sick!
[00:55:21.499 --> 00:55:23.641]  And it shows how much they hate us bitter clingers.
[00:55:23.641 --> 00:55:28.444]  They don't care if you're black, they don't care if you're Asian, Hispanic, Arabic, whatever.
[00:55:28.444 --> 00:55:29.545]  You're a Christian.
[00:55:29.545 --> 00:55:31.947]  This global government hates your guts.
[00:55:31.947 --> 00:55:33.708]  And Christians are persecuted!
[00:55:33.708 --> 00:55:39.873]  And our leaders, our Christian leaders, are controlled and won't stand up for us!
[00:55:39.873 --> 00:55:41.874]  We're under attack, people!
[00:55:41.874 --> 00:55:43.335]  And Christians should come together!
[00:55:43.335 --> 00:55:46.898]  And even if you don't believe in Christianity, but you believe in Western culture and freedom,
[00:55:48.032 --> 00:55:52.194]  You shouldn't like your culture, what you came from, being under attack!
[00:55:52.194 --> 00:55:57.296]  And being replaced with a bunch of crazy, radical, jihad crap!
[00:55:57.296 --> 00:55:59.657]  And people know I was against the Middle Eastern Wars.
[00:55:59.657 --> 00:56:02.499]  I don't dislike Muslims or Arabs or any of it.
[00:56:02.499 --> 00:56:11.043]  But I'm not going to bend over with a bunch of radical ones telling me that my daughters belong to them and are going to wear hoods on their heads over my dead body!
[00:56:12.671 --> 00:56:14.412]  We're taking this country back!
[00:56:14.412 --> 00:56:15.292]  Period!
[00:56:15.292 --> 00:56:16.253]  We're done!
[00:56:16.253 --> 00:56:22.977]  I don't care if it's globalists, radical muslims, satanists, whatever, whoever you are, get out of my way!
[00:56:22.977 --> 00:56:27.379]  1776 is coming again, and you're not going to stop the new enlightenment, the new renaissance.
[00:56:27.379 --> 00:56:28.680]  Get out of the way!
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:29.841]  All of you!
[00:56:29.841 --> 00:56:36.544]  Globalists that want to suppress technology, radical islamists that want to suppress culture, it's over!
[00:56:36.544 --> 00:56:40.827]  We're the real liberals, America was exceptional, and we're bringing it back!
[00:56:42.566 --> 00:56:50.840]  Now that said, I cannot state to new viewers and listeners how awesome InfoWarsLife.com products are.
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:56.749]  If you will just try things like Xtube or the product Deep Cleanse,
[00:56:58.348 --> 00:56:59.568]  It has changed my life.
[00:56:59.568 --> 00:57:09.050]  Almost everyone I know, basically everybody I know, that's taken the Deep Cleanse, that's taken X2, that's taken other key products at Infowarslife.com, it's changed their lives.
[00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:13.911]  This has the strongest, most concentrated shilajit organic we could find.
[00:57:13.911 --> 00:57:17.552]  That's thousands of compounds together in the Himalayan mountains.
[00:57:17.552 --> 00:57:24.313]  Basically, oils that have gone into the rocks and then concentrated and then come back out.
[00:57:25.469 --> 00:57:29.372]  It's one of the big secret things the Russians have used in the Olympics so much.
[00:57:29.372 --> 00:57:32.734]  And Deep Cleanse, that's just one of the compounds in Deep Cleanse.
[00:57:32.734 --> 00:57:34.155]  I take it every day.
[00:57:34.155 --> 00:57:41.439]  It has sold out both times we got it, because it's so hard to get the organic Shilajit.
[00:57:41.439 --> 00:57:44.982]  But it's back in stock, and it makes a wonderful Christmas present.
[00:57:44.982 --> 00:57:48.584]  We're only a month away now, basically, from Christmas.
[00:57:48.584 --> 00:57:49.705]  So give the gift.
[00:57:49.705 --> 00:57:51.446]  Give family some X2.
[00:57:51.446 --> 00:57:53.688]  Give family Deep Cleanse, not just yourself.
[00:57:53.688 --> 00:57:54.088]  And know,
[00:57:56.069 --> 00:58:04.993]  That your purchase is funding this operation and is absolutely critical and essential.
[00:58:04.993 --> 00:58:05.714]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:05.714 --> 00:58:07.715]  Here's a review from Gary Hall, El Paso, Texas.
[00:58:14.858 --> 00:58:18.281]  I usually take Deep Cleanse before I go to bed and wake up with more energy.
[00:58:18.281 --> 00:58:23.685]  I notice my face is skinnier and more toned, and I also use the restroom a lot easier and sleep a lot easier.
[00:58:23.685 --> 00:58:29.230]  A must-have for any person, whether you're a bodybuilder or fast-track businessman.
[00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:32.152]  Gary, thank you for support getting the Deep Cleanse.
[00:58:32.152 --> 00:58:34.394]  Available at Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:34.394 --> 00:58:35.555]  Get yours before it sells out.
[00:58:35.555 --> 00:58:38.117]  It'll probably be three months until we get more in.
[00:58:42.501 --> 00:58:44.088]  And your purchases are essential.
[00:58:44.088 --> 00:58:45.533]  So it's a win-win.
[00:58:45.533 --> 00:58:46.035]  Stay with us.
[00:58:49.272 --> 00:58:52.774]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:58:52.774 --> 00:59:01.019]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:01.019 --> 00:59:06.443]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:59:06.443 --> 00:59:08.964]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:08.964 --> 00:59:11.066]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:20.290]  BrainForce is here.
[00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:22.491]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:59:22.491 --> 00:59:27.493]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:59:27.493 --> 00:59:29.173]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[00:59:29.173 --> 00:59:30.774]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:59:30.774 --> 00:59:34.255]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:59:34.255 --> 00:59:36.236]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:59:36.236 --> 00:59:37.156]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:59:37.156 --> 00:59:38.376]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:59:38.376 --> 00:59:40.337]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:59:40.337 --> 00:59:45.939]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:51.853 --> 00:59:54.477]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:05.529 --> 01:00:06.830]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:08.590]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:10.371]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.371 --> 01:00:11.932]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.932 --> 01:00:13.513]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.513 --> 01:00:17.674]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.674 --> 01:00:21.736]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.958 --> 01:00:39.826]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[01:00:39.826 --> 01:00:41.735]  We are now into the second hour.
[01:00:43.488 --> 01:00:53.911]  And I've got to tell you, I'm not a tribal person in the mindless sense of, I go off what color somebody is, or I'm not a big joiner of groups.
[01:00:53.911 --> 01:00:55.752]  But I am pro-human.
[01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:57.652]  And I am pro-justice.
[01:00:57.652 --> 01:01:05.554]  And I physically get aggressive and feel hateful and feel, let's just be honest, violent.
[01:01:05.554 --> 01:01:10.736]  Doesn't mean I'm going to act on the violence, but it's normal genetic traits of an alpha male
[01:01:11.616 --> 01:01:18.357]  When he sees innocent people, men, women, and children being murdered by bullies to want to attack them.
[01:01:18.357 --> 01:01:23.959]  And the globalists know how to show us the jihadis and show us their arrogance, show us their classical evil.
[01:01:23.959 --> 01:01:25.559]  They're animated by a spirit of evil.
[01:01:25.559 --> 01:01:26.719]  They look crazy.
[01:01:26.719 --> 01:01:28.280]  They look hateful.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.280]  They look oppressive.
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:35.541]  They do just incredibly unchivalrous activities.
[01:01:35.541 --> 01:01:39.182]  And then I see them persecuting innocent people.
[01:01:41.161 --> 01:01:46.643]  Murdering innocent Muslims, that's the main group they kill.
[01:01:46.643 --> 01:01:51.044]  And Christians, and women, and it makes me sick!
[01:01:51.044 --> 01:02:02.687]  You know, we talked to Lord Monckton yesterday about a period of about 500 years, when there was a golden age of Islam, when it actually promoted medicine, and mathematics, and science, and actually helped Europe.
[01:02:05.302 --> 01:02:15.406]  But that whole time is over, and the West, certain leftist elements of it, that's who's doing it in big foundations, are funding radical Islam.
[01:02:15.406 --> 01:02:33.274]  We're going to talk to a real expert, the author of On the Run, Ahmad Salim, life after undercover, top FBI informant, Egyptian military officer, who tried to stop the first World Trade Center bombing, and they basically, the higher-ups, had the FBI stand down.
[01:02:33.274 --> 01:02:34.335]  That was a false flag.
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:41.447]  And we're going to get his expert view on ISIS and what's happening coming up.
[01:02:41.447 --> 01:02:52.739]  Briefly earlier, it's very expensive for us to spend the type of money we have to send three reporters to Paris, France.
[01:02:53.968 --> 01:02:55.509]  One of the most expensive cities in the world.
[01:02:55.509 --> 01:02:56.570]  And I'm not complaining about it.
[01:02:56.570 --> 01:02:58.912]  That's why we do what we do here.
[01:02:58.912 --> 01:02:59.893]  It's why we sell products.
[01:02:59.893 --> 01:03:00.814]  It's why we have sponsors.
[01:03:00.814 --> 01:03:07.099]  It's to build a media organization that can really report on things, really break things, and really find out what's happening.
[01:03:07.099 --> 01:03:08.801]  We didn't go out to France with an agenda.
[01:03:08.801 --> 01:03:13.565]  We went there to really see what was happening, and that's what we did.
[01:03:13.565 --> 01:03:18.069]  And we're reaching millions of new viewers and listeners because of it.
[01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:21.192]  The issue is, though, most people in the Internet age think of media as free.
[01:03:22.128 --> 01:03:24.410]  They consume it for free, and that's great.
[01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:28.234]  That's our goal, but we need people to purchase the products.
[01:03:28.234 --> 01:03:43.571]  And so I just want to ask listeners to partner with us going into this Christmas and holiday season to shop with the good guys, to shop with the Patriots, and to support our local AM and FM affiliates, to support those local sponsors, and to buy
[01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:52.944]  Shortwave AM, FM, weather radio, crank, solar systems, super high quality at infowarestore.com.
[01:03:52.944 --> 01:04:01.148]  To buy non-GMO heirloom non-hybrid seeds at infowarestore.com.
[01:04:01.148 --> 01:04:09.131]  To get high quality water filtration systems, books, videos, pro-liberty, pro-gun, Moulin Lambe apparel, Hillary for prison apparel.
[01:04:11.021 --> 01:04:15.443]  Products like Deep Cleanse that's finally back in stock, G-Shock watches.
[01:04:15.443 --> 01:04:20.185]  We're a distributor for them, a direct distributor, and have the lowest retail you'll find.
[01:04:20.185 --> 01:04:26.008]  You can match the price we have some other places, but you're not going to find lower.
[01:04:26.008 --> 01:04:33.392]  That's the deal we've got for G-Shock watches, a lot of the best optics for your firearms, radio lanterns.
[01:04:34.804 --> 01:04:38.466]  Just a lot of really cool stuff.
[01:04:38.466 --> 01:04:39.646]  Hillary laughing pin.
[01:04:39.646 --> 01:04:41.967]  You know, some fun gag things as well.
[01:04:41.967 --> 01:04:46.169]  Cheap stuff like InfoWars keychains, Moan Labe koozies.
[01:04:46.169 --> 01:04:48.170]  I mean, you name it, it's all about spreading the word.
[01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:49.491]  InfoWars cups.
[01:04:49.491 --> 01:04:50.992]  I haven't plugged the new cup.
[01:04:50.992 --> 01:04:53.253]  It's got a sheepdog chasing a wolf on it.
[01:04:53.253 --> 01:04:55.093]  Talking about sheepdogs and wolves.
[01:04:55.093 --> 01:04:56.994]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:04:56.994 --> 01:04:58.015]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:05:00.791 --> 01:05:04.233]  Are you one of the 80% of Americans that didn't get your flu shot yet?
[01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:08.555]  Well, Uber, the company that eventually wants to take away your ability to drive, has a solution.
[01:05:08.555 --> 01:05:12.177]  That's right, they're offering on-demand flu shots to your doorstep.
[01:05:12.177 --> 01:05:20.282]  Uber has teamed with Passport Health and Epidemico, a data mining company owned by Booz Allen Hamilton, to provide flu shots right to your door.
[01:05:20.282 --> 01:05:24.044]  That's right, now you can have aluminum, mercury, and other adjuvants injected into your arm
[01:05:24.284 --> 01:05:25.786]  In the comfort of your own home.
[01:05:25.786 --> 01:05:31.235]  And remember, the flu shot was only 18% effective last year, so this year's numbers can only get better.
[01:05:31.235 --> 01:05:31.815]  Or can they?
[01:05:32.802 --> 01:05:43.348]  Uber Health provided more than 2,000 vaccinations last year, and this year they're going to have up to 10,000 flu shots available, with hundreds of nurses ready in Uber vehicles across the country.
[01:05:43.348 --> 01:05:45.109]  But it's only one day.
[01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:49.371]  You can read more about it and Booz Allen Hamilton at InfoWars.com.

[01:06:30.172 --> 01:06:32.373]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:06:32.373 --> 01:06:37.376]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:06:37.376 --> 01:06:40.658]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:06:40.658 --> 01:06:44.140]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:46.121]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:06:46.121 --> 01:06:48.263]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:06:48.263 --> 01:06:50.244]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[01:06:58.869 --> 01:07:02.131]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[01:07:02.131 --> 01:07:12.075]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[01:07:12.075 --> 01:07:17.398]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[01:07:17.398 --> 01:07:26.262]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[01:07:26.562 --> 01:07:35.431]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[01:07:35.431 --> 01:07:42.538]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigerex herbal processing technique.

[01:07:57.411 --> 01:08:06.280]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:08.562]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:21.167 --> 01:08:27.833]  Donald Trump now in national polls is 45, 46 percent.
[01:08:27.833 --> 01:08:33.918]  He's gone up even more from the low 40s last week.
[01:08:33.918 --> 01:08:36.580]  And you've got both political parties trying to demonize him.
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:45.948]  The reason he's so popular is he is engaging in basic populist activity saying we deserve to be a sovereign country.
[01:08:45.948 --> 01:08:49.651]  We should have a government that puts the interests of the American people first.
[01:08:51.693 --> 01:08:55.894]  And that they call racist, that they call bad.
[01:08:55.894 --> 01:08:57.395]  They say it's politically incorrect.
[01:08:57.395 --> 01:09:00.796]  Well, so what, what the politically correct people push?
[01:09:00.796 --> 01:09:04.357]  Why do we have to sit there and listen to what they have to say anymore?
[01:09:04.357 --> 01:09:14.280]  Why are we under this ridiculous gauntlet of guilt?
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:19.082]  Why do we continue to grovel in the face of all of this?
[01:09:21.539 --> 01:09:28.614]  Meanwhile, we've seen our basic human liberties trashed, and we've seen homeland security expanded.
[01:09:33.939 --> 01:09:37.901]  And we see it targeting returning veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians.
[01:09:37.901 --> 01:09:46.165]  We see the IRS persecuting, en masse, the most law-abiding citizens in the country and getting caught politically targeting them.
[01:09:46.165 --> 01:09:51.507]  And MSNBC goes on air and says, good, we should target Christians and the Tea Party.
[01:09:51.507 --> 01:09:52.328]  They're racist!
[01:09:56.092 --> 01:10:16.312]  It's so dangerous when you have Rasmussen polls with a large percentage of Democrats saying arrest people who don't agree with man-made global warming or disarm gun owners and put them in prison or restrict their free speech.
[01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:17.013]  That's why
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:29.445]  A Supreme Court Justice told Matt Drudge this year that other members of the court have said we're coming in 2016 for your free speech.
[01:10:29.445 --> 01:10:32.386]  We're coming to restrict your free speech online.
[01:10:32.386 --> 01:10:39.490]  We're going to shut you up and your time is quote limited.
[01:10:39.490 --> 01:10:40.251]  This is real.
[01:10:41.547 --> 01:10:42.908]  This is really happening.
[01:10:42.908 --> 01:10:50.273]  There is an authoritarian move taking place with the Rhino, Neocon Republicans and the Democrats.
[01:10:50.273 --> 01:11:09.187]  And overseas, the exact same agenda is being pushed against populations there, where they act like, with all this fake consternation, that it's bizarre
[01:11:10.202 --> 01:11:22.730]  To say there should be any vetting of any type of refugees into a country, but then you've got to prove who you are to get a driver's license.
[01:11:22.730 --> 01:11:25.412]  So what is the endgame?
[01:11:25.412 --> 01:11:34.298]  The endgame is to allow jihad attacks all over the Western world, and then have the West misdirected and attack innocent countries
[01:11:35.632 --> 01:11:41.914]  And innocent leaders, just like Saudi Arabia was involved in 9-11, we attacked Iraq.
[01:11:41.914 --> 01:11:44.775]  That's now been declassified, it's now been leaked, it's now been admitted.
[01:11:44.775 --> 01:11:46.375]  The 28 pages.
[01:11:46.375 --> 01:12:02.579]  Just like they're now in the news saying, attack the Syrian army and the Syrian people and the Syrian president because it's his fault ISIS has a stronghold in Syria because he wasn't a good enough leader to defeat ISIS when our own government's been financing him and running him.
[01:12:02.579 --> 01:12:04.540]  And I know I've talked a lot about this, but man,
[01:12:05.603 --> 01:12:15.607]  If the public was politically and geopolitically informed, at any level, Obama would be indicted.
[01:12:15.607 --> 01:12:17.347]  Obama would be arrested.
[01:12:17.347 --> 01:12:22.829]  Angela Merkel, Hollande, all of them are engaged in treason.
[01:12:22.829 --> 01:12:25.970]  And I don't say those words lightly.
[01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:33.293]  Our government overthrew the Egyptian government
[01:12:35.247 --> 01:12:36.888]  What was it, four years ago?
[01:12:36.888 --> 01:12:52.334]  For an entire year, and put the Muslim Brotherhood in charge while they were blowing up churches, crucifying people, attacking military bases, shooting members of the Egyptian military, until 15 million people hit the streets and removed that government of Morsi.
[01:12:52.334 --> 01:12:54.235]  We've got an expert coming on who can break it down.
[01:12:54.235 --> 01:12:55.636]  He's having some Skype issues right now.
[01:12:55.636 --> 01:12:56.336]  We're about to go to him.
[01:13:00.356 --> 01:13:11.923]  And you think about how our ally for 33 years is overthrown, and they don't put some more democratic, more pro-Western group in.
[01:13:11.923 --> 01:13:15.586]  They put radicals in that want to destroy the West.
[01:13:15.586 --> 01:13:16.546]  Why?
[01:13:16.546 --> 01:13:17.007]  Why?
[01:13:17.007 --> 01:13:20.109]  Because then they can wreck the Middle East.
[01:13:20.109 --> 01:13:22.470]  The globalists can, and they can wreck us too.
[01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:28.274]  Because the globalists have a philosophy of divide and conquer, deindustrialization, and balkanization.
[01:13:30.234 --> 01:13:44.126]  Secular government from Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953 in Iran to the government of Hossein Mubarak has been overthrown by the West because they do not want stability in those countries.
[01:13:44.126 --> 01:13:49.071]  Same reason Saddam Hussein was removed and all these HBO movies made about how bad he was.
[01:13:49.071 --> 01:13:50.352]  A bunch of bull!
[01:13:50.352 --> 01:13:53.935]  Saddam Hussein is an angel compared to people like Al Qaeda.
[01:13:56.089 --> 01:13:58.170]  Saddam Hussein never attacked the United States.
[01:13:58.170 --> 01:14:05.594]  Saddam Hussein was told to attack Iran and given $40 billion by the United States and satellite intel.
[01:14:05.594 --> 01:14:16.220]  Oh, we know he launched chemical attacks on the Kurds because the CIA gave him the directives and how to use it with his helicopters and his artillery.
[01:14:20.825 --> 01:14:23.307]  And it's wrong to set countries up.
[01:14:23.307 --> 01:14:25.089]  It's wrong to destroy countries.
[01:14:25.089 --> 01:14:27.170]  It's wrong to break up countries.
[01:14:27.170 --> 01:14:34.056]  Like they're breaking up Syria and Iraq right now.
[01:14:34.056 --> 01:14:40.662]  And it is completely and totally cold-blooded.
[01:14:40.662 --> 01:14:47.968]  In other news, while we're waiting for our guest to sort out audio, or we're sorting it out, Oklahoma earthquake rumbles through nine states.
[01:14:50.165 --> 01:14:58.408]  There were no immediate reports of injuries or serious damage after a magnitude 4.7 earthquake struck Oklahoma and Kansas Thursday morning, authorities said.
[01:14:58.408 --> 01:15:03.109]  The quake shook parts of northern Oklahoma and southern Kansas at 1.42 a.m.
[01:15:03.109 --> 01:15:11.192]  According to the National Earthquake Information Center, it was centered near Cherokee, Oklahoma, which lies 20 miles south of the Kansas border in the Ozark Mountains.
[01:15:11.832 --> 01:15:27.620]  The quake was nothing residents of the area are not used to according to National Earthquake Information Center geophysicist Randy Baldwin who told the Associated Press that in 2015 he has felt more than 20 magnitude 4 earthquakes.
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:31.762]  The point is is it's heating back up and I'm not worried about
[01:15:33.615 --> 01:15:37.378]  The Balcones fault line through Austin, Texas and four extinct volcanoes.
[01:15:37.378 --> 01:15:41.962]  I'm not worried about the fault lines and the new MADRA and all of it up there.
[01:15:41.962 --> 01:15:53.170]  What I'm worried about is the ring of fire, because every seismologist we've talked to, every report we've seen, admits the entire ring of fire that caused tsunamis a decade ago and caused
[01:15:54.119 --> 01:15:57.302]  Earthquakes in Japan and Fukushima, all of it.
[01:15:57.302 --> 01:16:07.471]  The only place that hasn't triggered and had its earthquake yet is the section that runs up from northern Baja up into Seattle.
[01:16:07.471 --> 01:16:15.878]  And the main trigger point is smack dab in those fault lines outside Los Angeles.
[01:16:15.878 --> 01:16:18.820]  The old classic statement that it may just break off and fall in the ocean.
[01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:20.382]  It's amazing.
[01:16:20.382 --> 01:16:20.582]  So,
[01:16:23.439 --> 01:16:34.987]  They're not saying it's a question of if but when, and they're saying it's imminent for a seven magnitude earthquake on the West Coast any time.
[01:16:34.987 --> 01:16:37.048]  And it's a miracle!
[01:16:37.048 --> 01:16:37.909]  A miracle!
[01:16:37.909 --> 01:16:52.439]  It hasn't happened yet, and you're going to see highways collapse, you're going to see buildings fall in, you are going to see some major death tolls when this sucker hits, because they say it's going to be one of the biggest ones ever recorded in modern seismology on the West Coast.
[01:16:55.529 --> 01:16:59.734]  So just remember, we're so worried about terrorism and all the rest of it.
[01:16:59.734 --> 01:17:02.798]  Terrorism is one of the rarest forms of death in the West.
[01:17:02.798 --> 01:17:06.742]  It still is a problem, obviously, if you get killed by it, or injured, or lose family.
[01:17:06.742 --> 01:17:14.431]  But we shouldn't give up any of our liberties in the fight against terrorists, because it won't protect you anyways, and that's what governments want.
[01:17:15.287 --> 01:17:19.289]  That said, though, I don't know why the West is opening the door to this.
[01:17:19.289 --> 01:17:22.511]  Now, joining us for the Balance of the Hour is Ahmad Saleem.
[01:17:22.511 --> 01:17:24.371]  Ahmadsaleem.org.
[01:17:24.371 --> 01:17:29.094]  E-M-A-D-S-A-L-E-M dot O-R-G.
[01:17:29.094 --> 01:17:33.596]  He's the best-selling author of On the Run, Life After Undercover.
[01:17:33.596 --> 01:17:37.758]  You want to understand what really happened with the situation.
[01:17:39.403 --> 01:17:46.796]  Back in the early 1990s with the first World Trade Center bombing, he was there, he tried to stop it, and was ordered to stand down.
[01:17:46.796 --> 01:17:48.098]  That's even been in the New York Times.
[01:17:49.292 --> 01:18:00.442]  We're going to go to break here in a moment and go through it all, but Ahmad Salim is the former Egyptian military colonel who went undercover with the FBI and infiltrated the first Al-Qaeda cell in American soil in New York City in 1993, World Trade Center bombing.
[01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:07.848]  He also penetrated the headquarters of Al-Qaeda in America under the leadership of the blind sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and the underground terrorist cell.
[01:18:07.848 --> 01:18:14.494]  They were planning to blow up the landmarks of New York City and become the government's star witness in the day of terror trial.
[01:18:15.054 --> 01:18:19.397]  He is the author of Undercover, the Untold Story of Al Qaeda, the FBI, the CIA, and America.
[01:18:19.397 --> 01:18:22.999]  You should get the book just to support somebody that has as much courage as he did.
[01:18:22.999 --> 01:18:30.683]  And of course, the LA Times breaks down how powerful his book is as well in a review.
[01:18:30.683 --> 01:18:34.446]  Seeking a sense of purpose, FBI informant decides to tell all.
[01:18:34.446 --> 01:18:36.027]  We're going to break in about a minute and a half.
[01:18:36.027 --> 01:18:39.389]  He wants to get into the attacks, but let me ask him this question.
[01:18:39.389 --> 01:18:41.090]  We appreciate him coming on in the one minute we have.
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:52.709]  Is there a method behind the madness to bring in millions of people from known Wahhabist, Jihad-held areas into Europe and the United States?
[01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:53.710]  What is Obama?
[01:18:53.710 --> 01:18:54.851]  What is Merkel?
[01:18:54.851 --> 01:18:56.152]  What is the French President?
[01:18:56.152 --> 01:18:56.853]  What are they thinking?
[01:18:58.035 --> 01:19:06.538]  Well, I think bringing these refugees into our homeland is a big mistake.
[01:19:06.538 --> 01:19:13.520]  And I think that will jeopardize the safety of the American people.
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:17.161]  And we got exposed to the day of mayhem
[01:19:18.197 --> 01:19:18.497]  I think?
[01:19:30.097 --> 01:19:32.018]  Well, Colonel, stay there.
[01:19:32.018 --> 01:19:34.399]  I want to come back, because you're the expert.
[01:19:34.399 --> 01:19:38.422]  You've infiltrated these groups all over the world.

[01:23:27.941 --> 01:23:31.002]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:23:31.002 --> 01:23:33.624]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:23:33.624 --> 01:23:34.384]  Croix River.
[01:23:34.384 --> 01:23:35.424]  I loved my dad.
[01:23:35.424 --> 01:23:36.605]  But boy was he stubborn.
[01:23:36.605 --> 01:23:39.566]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:23:39.566 --> 01:23:40.446]  His excuse?
[01:23:40.446 --> 01:23:41.787]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:23:41.787 --> 01:23:43.388]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.

[01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:06.958]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:24:06.958 --> 01:24:08.819]  This is a short six-minute segment.
[01:24:08.819 --> 01:24:11.381]  Big, long, 18-minute segment coming up.
[01:24:11.381 --> 01:24:13.762]  Ahmad Salim is our guest.
[01:24:13.762 --> 01:24:18.845]  He was, of course, an Egyptian army colonel sent over here to work with the CIA and the FBI.
[01:24:18.845 --> 01:24:25.870]  Well, he already had moved here, began working with them to try to stop radical jihad groups, the first al-Qaeda cell inside the United States.
[01:24:26.690 --> 01:24:37.479]  And he is a specific expert, obviously, fighting Wahhabis, fighting radical Sunnis, and other groups here in the United States and overseas.
[01:24:37.479 --> 01:24:52.152]  And he wants to go over his condolences to France, the similarity between the simultaneous attack on France and the simultaneously bombing of the day of the terror attack on New York City they were planning, the Russian plane in Egypt, and so much more.
[01:24:52.752 --> 01:24:58.353]  So, sir, please continue with your breakdown of what is... I mean, our governments aren't stupid.
[01:24:58.353 --> 01:25:03.875]  So what are they planning, allowing these groups in that we know are going to end up attacking and have been attacking?
[01:25:03.875 --> 01:25:14.757]  And then I specifically want to flesh out where you think ISIS is going in all of this, and are they double-crossing some of the Western governments that were aiding them in the fight against Assad?
[01:25:16.141 --> 01:25:31.874]  Well, Alex, unfortunately, if we allow this group of Sunni Wahhabist people to enter into our land, there is no doubt in my mind that it will happen again.
[01:25:31.874 --> 01:25:38.179]  We already got attacked in 1993 by the same group.
[01:25:38.179 --> 01:25:41.682]  However, different name, it's all the same ideology.
[01:25:42.817 --> 01:26:00.517]  And we were able to stop five bombs from going simultaneously in the Holland Tunnel, Lincoln Tunnel, the Washington Bridge, the headquarter of the FBI in New York City, in 26 Federal Plaza, and the United Nations building.
[01:26:01.578 --> 01:26:10.483]  Unfortunately, they succeeded to pull that trick in France and the day of mayhem happened in France last week.
[01:26:10.483 --> 01:26:17.167]  My biggest, my biggest condemnation to that cowardly attack to attack
[01:26:17.887 --> 01:26:34.211]  People who are not armed, civilian people has nothing to do with their corrupt ideology and they attack them when they are in a regular day having fun.
[01:26:34.211 --> 01:26:37.172]  If we allow these people, the same group,
[01:26:38.055 --> 01:26:41.696]  To enter into our homeland, it will happen again.
[01:26:41.696 --> 01:26:59.879]  But again, I don't know if our government wanted that to happen again, to start to take our liberty out of our hand more and more and put more restriction on the media like you, Alex, for example.
[01:26:59.879 --> 01:27:07.261]  I'm sure there is a lot of governmental agencies would like to shut your show up.
[01:27:07.261 --> 01:27:07.561]  Yes, sir.
[01:27:08.675 --> 01:27:20.138]  And unfortunately, if we can stop this madness from happening before it happened, and then they will say, oops, it happened again.
[01:27:20.138 --> 01:27:32.942]  And they let these people to start to hurt the American people to give them a reason to start to monitor more and to take our liberty out of our hands.
[01:27:34.474 --> 01:27:41.741]  And this from a former Egyptian army colonel, Ahmad Salim, who tried to stop the first World Trade Center attack.
[01:27:41.741 --> 01:27:46.605]  The higher-ups above him at the FBI were doing their job as well, but they were basically countermanded.
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:59.127]  So the bombing went forward, and we know that story because he recorded them, he tapes them, and not just the terrorists, but also the government basically involved in the partial stand down.
[01:27:59.127 --> 01:28:05.852]  And for whatever reason, that bombing went forward, but you were able, as you said, to stop the other bombings.
[01:28:05.852 --> 01:28:07.353]  Looking at this situation,
[01:28:09.238 --> 01:28:20.527]  In Europe, if we're bringing in such large numbers of ISIS, just from a gut level, Colonel, it tells me that when there are attacks, there's going to be a lot more of them and they're going to be bigger.
[01:28:20.527 --> 01:28:23.270]  Is that accurate to say?
[01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:31.737]  It is very accurate, Alex, and that is something I would like to bring to the American people's attention.
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:52.005]  Merkel in Germany was kind enough to open her doors to the immigrants and the consequences was really hefty that on the day of the soccer game they had that tip that there is a terrorist attack going to happen.
[01:28:53.146 --> 01:29:13.236]  They vacated the stadium and it never heard in the American mainstream media that they uncovered an ambulance loaded with explosives parked near the stadium ready to get blown up at the people of Germany.
[01:29:14.376 --> 01:29:19.957]  And this has never been published in American mainstream media.
[01:29:19.957 --> 01:29:21.738]  I never heard it in American media.
[01:29:21.738 --> 01:29:22.858]  Colonel, Colonel, stay there.
[01:29:22.858 --> 01:29:25.978]  You're going to have the floor when we come back because you have incredible credibility.
[01:29:25.978 --> 01:29:29.859]  New York Times, LA Times, everything you've ever talked about has been proven.
[01:29:29.859 --> 01:29:30.619]  I was unaware of this.
[01:29:30.619 --> 01:29:32.940]  Please tell us the sources and what happened.
[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:39.361]  We know about the evacuation, the canceling of the football game, the soccer game, but I did not know that they actually had the
[01:29:40.081 --> 01:29:42.303]  Explosives-laden ambulance that was discovered.
[01:29:42.303 --> 01:29:43.583]  This is incredible.
[01:29:43.583 --> 01:29:44.824]  Imagine if it would have gone off.
[01:29:44.824 --> 01:29:46.125]  It could have killed thousands.
[01:29:46.125 --> 01:29:48.727]  We'll cover it all straight ahead.
[01:29:48.727 --> 01:29:50.127]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.127 --> 01:29:52.649]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.649 --> 01:29:55.331]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.551 --> 01:30:04.877]  It's election season, a time where we'll soon find out who will be the leader of the free world.
[01:30:04.877 --> 01:30:14.668]  Well, in what appears to be a first for a serious presidential contender, Hillary Clinton's campaign is going after the Laugh Factory comedians for making fun of her.
[01:30:14.668 --> 01:30:20.335]  A short video of this performance is posted on the website of the renowned comedy club, Laugh Factory.
[01:30:20.555 --> 01:30:23.317]  And the Clinton campaign has tried to censor it.
[01:30:23.317 --> 01:30:32.385]  Besides demanding that the video be taken down, Clinton demanded the personal contact information of the performers that appear in the recording.
[01:30:32.385 --> 01:30:36.208]  So what was so crass that the Clinton campaign wants it taken down?
[01:30:36.208 --> 01:30:46.276]  Well, the skits make fun of Clinton's wardrobe, her age, sexual orientation, the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and the former first lady's relationship with her famous husband.
[01:30:46.596 --> 01:30:49.519]  Basically what we do here at InfoWars every single day.
[01:30:49.519 --> 01:30:56.585]  Now if you want to watch this video for yourself, The Laugh Factory has appropriately titled it, Hillary vs. the First Amendment.

[01:31:45.103 --> 01:31:49.166]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:49.166 --> 01:31:52.988]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:32:07.858 --> 01:32:08.098]  We're good.
[01:32:29.201 --> 01:32:30.321]  BrainForce is here.
[01:32:30.321 --> 01:32:32.542]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:32:32.542 --> 01:32:37.524]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:32:37.524 --> 01:32:40.825]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:32:40.825 --> 01:32:44.306]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:32:44.306 --> 01:32:46.287]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:32:46.287 --> 01:32:50.388]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean.

[01:33:17.572 --> 01:33:21.654]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:21.654 --> 01:33:23.615]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:23.615 --> 01:33:27.917]  He was a army colonel in the Egyptian military.
[01:33:27.917 --> 01:33:35.721]  He had a lot of experience dealing with radicals and extremists who want to seize power.
[01:33:48.756 --> 01:33:56.599]  And the main group is coming out of Saudi Arabia, generally, and that, of course, is the Wahhabist radical version of Sunni Islam.
[01:33:56.599 --> 01:33:58.760]  Most Sunni Muslims are not radical.
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:00.561]  They don't want to terrorize people.
[01:34:00.561 --> 01:34:06.543]  But it is this group that continues to carry out most of the terror worldwide.
[01:34:06.543 --> 01:34:10.005]  And I want to get later into the fact that Egypt's been forced to now start working with Russia.
[01:34:11.425 --> 01:34:14.190]  Our government has double-crossed Egypt on record.
[01:34:14.190 --> 01:34:19.821]  They've had trials there where it's come out the Muslim Brotherhood's been financed by Obama through Kenya.
[01:34:21.738 --> 01:34:26.219]  I mean, this is a really reckless, bizarre move by Obama.
[01:34:26.219 --> 01:34:30.600]  And I never believed that he secretly worked with radical Islam and had some plan.
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:34.861]  Because I've been against conquering these countries, invading them, destabilizing them.
[01:34:34.861 --> 01:34:37.442]  As folks know, I was against the Iraq War.
[01:34:37.442 --> 01:34:39.763]  But now I see what Obama's doing.
[01:34:39.763 --> 01:34:42.363]  It's just, it's not in the U.S.
[01:34:42.363 --> 01:34:43.123]  interest.
[01:34:43.123 --> 01:34:45.904]  It's not in anybody's interest.
[01:34:45.904 --> 01:34:49.265]  It's not in people's interest in Sunni countries to be under these Wahhabis.
[01:34:50.694 --> 01:34:56.281]  And it just gets worse and worse and worse and crazier.
[01:34:56.281 --> 01:35:06.876]  And they're catching just huge numbers of these folks coming in now and they're bringing them in and Obama says he'll veto a bill just to screen these people who they admit five out of six passports are fake!
[01:35:07.617 --> 01:35:08.938]  These aren't Syrian refugees.
[01:35:08.938 --> 01:35:11.440]  These are jihadis that went in there to take over.
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:13.401]  Now, I'm going to stop ranting.
[01:35:13.401 --> 01:35:18.404]  Again, Colonel Ahmad Saleem is the best-selling author of On the Run.
[01:35:18.404 --> 01:35:24.108]  You can go to his website and find the book and read it and show it to your friends and family.
[01:35:24.108 --> 01:35:26.169]  AhmadSaleem.org.
[01:35:26.169 --> 01:35:33.414]  I'm going to tweet that out, by the way, at Real Alex Jones and tell folks to get this hero's book because he risked his life and a lot more
[01:35:33.874 --> 01:35:35.155]  to bring us this information.
[01:35:35.155 --> 01:35:37.798]  He's telling you right now specifically what's going on.
[01:35:37.798 --> 01:35:39.019]  So we ended it.
[01:35:39.019 --> 01:35:43.724]  I actually Googled it and here it is in the foreign press.
[01:35:43.724 --> 01:35:47.648]  Ambulance full of explosives reportedly found near German Stadium.
[01:35:47.648 --> 01:35:51.232]  But we never heard this here in the United States as he said.
[01:35:51.232 --> 01:35:53.014]  So Colonel, please continue.
[01:35:53.925 --> 01:35:54.945]  Yes, sir.
[01:35:54.945 --> 01:36:04.809]  You mentioned the Kenyan connection with the Muslim Brotherhood, and that shows in Mr. Obongo Obama.
[01:36:04.809 --> 01:36:18.535]  Mr. Obongo Obama is Mr. Barack Hussein's brother in Kenya, and he is the main support line for the Muslim Brotherhood in Africa.
[01:36:20.216 --> 01:36:32.783]  Unfortunately, the Muslim Brotherhood started to blackmail Mr. Obama, and the Egyptian intelligence, of course, leaked to the media.
[01:36:32.783 --> 01:36:40.047]  And if you have that newspaper, it's called Al-Ahram newspaper, that is the governmental
[01:36:41.036 --> 01:36:45.938]  Main issue of newspaper who talks on behalf of the government.
[01:36:45.938 --> 01:36:58.563]  Mr. Obama succeeded to alienate Egypt from working and cooperating with America, alienating Saudi Arabia from cooperating with America.
[01:36:58.563 --> 01:37:07.366]  And we know that we have Libya at this table, we have Syria at this table, and we have Iraq under the Iranian control.
[01:37:08.306 --> 01:37:17.532]  And Mr. Obama, unfortunately, become alienated from this country, not getting their support in that kind of war.
[01:37:17.532 --> 01:37:28.759]  And this is the most Sunni Arab countries knows how to talk the talk and walk the walk when it comes on war on terrorists.
[01:37:28.759 --> 01:37:31.741]  But unfortunately, I don't know why Mr. Obama
[01:37:32.501 --> 01:37:35.382]  have to support the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:37:35.382 --> 01:37:52.766]  And you can see the headline in an Ahram newspaper that the Muslim Brotherhood warning Mr. Obama not to withdraw his support from them or they're going to release documentation to jeopardize his throne.
[01:37:52.766 --> 01:37:53.506]  Wow!
[01:37:53.506 --> 01:37:59.728]  Colonel, this is incredible because Dr. Jerome Corsi, as you know, has worked in the Middle East for the State Department and done a lot of other work.
[01:38:00.608 --> 01:38:06.493]  He has published in WorldNetDaily a lot of what the Egyptian government and courts have brought out, including the documents.
[01:38:06.493 --> 01:38:12.958]  But now by Obama's actions, from the threats of a year ago of blackmail, we see it's working.
[01:38:12.958 --> 01:38:20.584]  That makes sense why Obama would do things that aren't even good for him, because his cousins and half-brothers and others are on record
[01:38:21.244 --> 01:38:28.892]  Working with them, they are very daring that they would try to blackmail a President of the United States.
[01:38:28.892 --> 01:38:37.200]  And it looks like, if you're correct, and I think the evidence shows you are, they have really outclassed him and really double-crossed him.
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:44.208]  Can you expand on that and break down where you see this going and what you think ISIS and the Muslim Brotherhood, kind of their spokesmen, are going to do?
[01:38:45.387 --> 01:38:50.333]  Well, at this time, this is the newspaper in the Middle East.
[01:38:50.333 --> 01:38:58.682]  If you see the intelligence on the Egyptian streets today, you can see how they portray Mr. Obama.
[01:38:58.682 --> 01:39:01.785]  How they portrayed him with a big beard and a turban.
[01:39:02.726 --> 01:39:11.931]  And they asking him to stop his support to the Muslim Brotherhood because they are bombing inside Cairo.
[01:39:11.931 --> 01:39:16.394]  They are bombing inside the Muslim Arab countries.
[01:39:16.394 --> 01:39:25.479]  And we want to open the door for them to come to America to start to carry their bombings as well up here.
[01:39:25.479 --> 01:39:27.200]  Unfortunately for Germany,
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:51.490]  They don't want to admit this ambulance full of explosives because it is against what the president of Germany had done, that she allowed these people to enter her country and now they will start the bombings and they will start to suffer a great deal of pain from that fanatic group.
[01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:58.311]  And if we let these people to enter here, we're going to have the same consequences.
[01:39:58.311 --> 01:40:00.692]  And then we will lose our liberty.
[01:40:00.692 --> 01:40:07.914]  I want to go back to Mr. Obama's first speech in Egypt, in Cairo, Egypt.
[01:40:07.914 --> 01:40:17.016]  The first visit when he went there and he said to the Muslim Brotherhood, I am sorry for what America had done.
[01:40:18.163 --> 01:40:23.828]  I don't understand what is Mr. Obama apologizing for?
[01:40:23.828 --> 01:40:28.392]  America was a great deal of help to Egypt at that time.
[01:40:28.392 --> 01:40:36.538]  We were giving the Egyptian military 1.5 billion by the B dollars as an asset, as a help.
[01:40:37.259 --> 01:40:38.640]  With their military.
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:45.663]  All of that being stopped and that allowed Saudi Arabia to step in with their money.
[01:40:45.663 --> 01:40:51.065]  And then Putin has to step in to show his support to Egypt.
[01:40:51.065 --> 01:40:57.748]  America walked out of the Egyptian land and Putin put his roots up there.
[01:40:57.748 --> 01:41:01.230]  So we look at the first speech from Mr. Obama.
[01:41:01.230 --> 01:41:03.491]  I'm sorry for the America.
[01:41:03.491 --> 01:41:06.052]  I am sorry for what America had done.
[01:41:06.872 --> 01:41:11.115]  And then you can see the behavior after that.
[01:41:11.115 --> 01:41:31.107]  Unfortunately, Mr. President, you castrated the American military and the American influence around the world because America, when it is strong, you would have a lot of people wanted to relate to.
[01:41:31.107 --> 01:41:36.130]  Today, unfortunately, I know for a fact that America is not being
[01:41:37.412 --> 01:41:50.563]  Liked or respected by our Arab Sunni allies and we are not helping even our allies in the countries in the Middle East.
[01:41:50.563 --> 01:41:52.484]  On the contrary, he is trying to
[01:41:54.466 --> 01:42:00.951]  Say that he is fighting the war, but we are making only five bombings a day.
[01:42:00.951 --> 01:42:02.512]  Nothing.
[01:42:02.512 --> 01:42:10.358]  A thousand, a thousand, and more than a thousand a day at the time when we were fighting real fight.
[01:42:10.358 --> 01:42:15.442]  Mr. Obama, unfortunately, you weakened our country.
[01:42:15.442 --> 01:42:16.823]  You are not helping us.
[01:42:17.622 --> 01:42:24.268]  Well, let me ask you this, Colonel, because I don't think I've had anybody on that boils it down, that crystallizes it like you do.
[01:42:24.268 --> 01:42:27.571]  Everything you say, I mean, I look at the news every day, it's all true.
[01:42:27.571 --> 01:42:34.598]  And I sit back, and I think I had a blind side, because I know our government's not perfect, it's done bad things, it's been corrupt, all governments have problems.
[01:42:34.598 --> 01:42:38.841]  We try to, you know, influence them to be better, that's why we get involved, just like you did in your government.
[01:42:40.359 --> 01:42:47.656]  I used to hear Obama wants to bring down America, he wants to destroy our influence, he wants to sabotage us, and I went, look, the Democrats have got problems.
[01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:50.231]  But that's not what they're really doing.
[01:42:50.231 --> 01:42:59.797]  Now, everything they do, from our borders, to our energy being cut off, to our jobs, to the regulations, to Obamacare, designed to wreck healthcare.
[01:42:59.797 --> 01:43:00.477]  I mean, I've read it.
[01:43:00.477 --> 01:43:01.237]  I know what it does.
[01:43:01.237 --> 01:43:03.799]  It's designed to.
[01:43:03.799 --> 01:43:10.063]  Just everything he does is like he's a sleeper cell or something to destroy the country.
[01:43:10.063 --> 01:43:13.325]  And I tell you, I've never been more, not even afraid,
[01:43:14.577 --> 01:43:15.758]  It's more shocked.
[01:43:15.758 --> 01:43:18.340]  I just am in disbelief.
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:20.822]  And then I wonder, what is he going to pull next?
[01:43:20.822 --> 01:43:26.265]  And why would our elites finance him to do this?
[01:43:26.265 --> 01:43:30.368]  And then I want to believe that there's a method behind the madness, even if it's evil.
[01:43:30.368 --> 01:43:37.674]  But then I come to the realization, I talk to a lot of high-level generals, current and retired and other people, and they say, no, you don't understand.
[01:43:38.621 --> 01:43:39.482]  I agree with you 100% on that.
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:15.935]  Alex because Obama has apologizing about what America is doing bringing democracy and trying to bring peace into the Middle East.
[01:44:15.935 --> 01:44:19.259]  Mr. Obama used to sit in his church.
[01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:33.572]  Listen for his minister, Mr. Wright, when he was damning America, when he's attacking America, and he accepted that and attended that church for years and years.
[01:44:33.572 --> 01:44:45.123]  And once he got the opportunity to become the President of the United States, he started to castrate the power of America and lower the energy of the American
[01:44:45.843 --> 01:44:47.804]  Influence around the world.
[01:44:47.804 --> 01:44:57.009]  And that opened the door and vacuumed to ISIS to take place in Iraq, in Syria, spread to Libya.
[01:44:57.009 --> 01:44:59.130]  Now they are hitting in Egypt.
[01:44:59.130 --> 01:45:01.131]  Now they are in France.
[01:45:01.131 --> 01:45:04.113]  They just about to hit in Germany.
[01:45:04.113 --> 01:45:06.914]  They succeeded to stop them at this time.
[01:45:06.914 --> 01:45:10.076]  And if we allow to open our doors to that,
[01:45:10.996 --> 01:45:13.618]  Immigrants to enter our home.
[01:45:13.618 --> 01:45:24.427]  I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I am afraid that if they allow these people to walk in, that's going to be a false flag operation to let them bomb America.
[01:45:24.427 --> 01:45:27.189]  And then they say, oops, they bomb America.
[01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:32.473]  We have to monitor America more and take your guns and take your liberty and take
[01:45:33.314 --> 01:45:40.322]  Every, even the mainstream media today start to be controlled by the government.
[01:45:40.322 --> 01:45:41.423]  It is saddening me.
[01:45:41.423 --> 01:45:46.349]  This is not America I immigrated to 30 years ago.
[01:45:47.779 --> 01:45:54.083]  This is not America which I put my life and my family's life on the line for.
[01:45:54.083 --> 01:45:58.086]  Mr. Obama, please, please help America.
[01:45:58.086 --> 01:46:01.348]  Don't weaken America.
[01:46:01.348 --> 01:46:08.813]  And don't listen to Mr. Pastor who used to explain to you that America should be doomed.
[01:46:09.668 --> 01:46:12.730]  With what we are trying to accomplish.
[01:46:12.730 --> 01:46:15.131]  America can lead the world.
[01:46:15.131 --> 01:46:19.073]  America cannot be led by Russia.
[01:46:19.073 --> 01:46:29.579]  Russia today have influence in the Middle East, in Egypt, in Saudi Arabia, in Jordan, in Iran, in Iraq, in Syria.
[01:46:29.579 --> 01:46:37.604]  Are we gonna wait until- And you said this, you said this with us over a year ago, Colonel Salim, and now it's all gotten more obvious.
[01:46:39.066 --> 01:46:43.829]  And again, it's not that I'm against Russia, but the whole point is why would... It's one thing if the U.S.
[01:46:43.829 --> 01:46:51.633]  pulled out influence-wise, but it actually backed the radical al-Qaeda, al-Nusra groups that became ISIS in Syria.
[01:46:51.633 --> 01:46:52.794]  So it's even worse.
[01:46:52.794 --> 01:46:55.376]  It's not just pulling out.
[01:46:55.376 --> 01:46:56.957]  It's putting bad guys in.
[01:46:56.957 --> 01:46:59.158]  I mean, what did Obama think?
[01:46:59.158 --> 01:47:00.459]  What did the CIA think?
[01:47:00.459 --> 01:47:03.961]  Because we've had the military whistleblowers on, CIA pilots on.
[01:47:04.901 --> 01:47:07.942]  I mean, we've had Colonel Schaefer on.
[01:47:07.942 --> 01:47:13.003]  One week after Benghazi happened, they said it was a weapons transfer up to those groups.
[01:47:13.003 --> 01:47:14.743]  And now it's been proven.
[01:47:14.743 --> 01:47:17.544]  But didn't they know ISIS would turn against them?
[01:47:17.544 --> 01:47:18.624]  And I guess you said it.
[01:47:18.624 --> 01:47:28.667]  Then when ISIS attacks us, they think we're so politically illiterate, they take our rights, like this congresswoman in Illinois says, take our guns because ISIS shot people.
[01:47:28.667 --> 01:47:31.267]  Well, I mean, they have a gun ban in France.
[01:47:31.267 --> 01:47:34.088]  How do you blame what happened in France on my guns?
[01:47:35.367 --> 01:47:39.789]  Well, this is one of the policies Mr. Obama is trying to do.
[01:47:39.789 --> 01:47:51.374]  He is trying to control everybody in America, taking your rights, taking your guns, stripping you from your rights, so he can control you!
[01:47:52.290 --> 01:47:53.932]  You cannot defend yourself.
[01:47:53.932 --> 01:47:58.517]  You cannot stand up for your rights and executive order.
[01:47:58.517 --> 01:47:59.978]  He has a phone and a pen.
[01:47:59.978 --> 01:48:07.747]  Unfortunately, he's using that very well to weaken America and lacking.
[01:48:07.747 --> 01:48:12.672]  And if Mr. Obama really loves the Syrian people,
[01:48:13.684 --> 01:48:20.668]  What did he do when the Syrian people got gassed by Mr. Bashar al-Assad?
[01:48:20.668 --> 01:48:25.850]  What did he do about his red line to Mr. Assad if he gassed his people?
[01:48:25.850 --> 01:48:38.577]  Why didn't he take care of the Syrian people before they get smothered in their homeland to the point that they start to immigrate to Europe and to come to invade the Western world?
[01:48:38.577 --> 01:48:40.618]  He gave ISIS the time
[01:48:42.130 --> 01:48:53.381]  To grow up as much as he gave Iran the time by slacking and lacking on the deal he had done with them.
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:58.364]  Which is catastrophe to give Iran that power.
[01:48:58.364 --> 01:49:04.470]  And there he is giving them the time, giving them the money, the billions of dollars they're gonna get it back.
[01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:06.973]  It's gonna go into terrorism again.
[01:49:06.973 --> 01:49:10.216]  And all of that will work against America.
[01:49:10.216 --> 01:49:11.237]  I don't know why.
[01:49:11.237 --> 01:49:12.539]  I don't know what he is thinking.
[01:49:13.146 --> 01:49:14.247]  All right, sir, stay there.
[01:49:14.247 --> 01:49:16.409]  We're gonna come back with two more short segments with you.
[01:49:16.409 --> 01:49:18.450]  The book, On the Run.
[01:49:18.450 --> 01:49:19.431]  Everybody should get it.
[01:49:19.431 --> 01:49:25.215]  It's an incredible story of how he tried to stop it, even the FBI tried to stop it, and they were ordered to stand down.
[01:49:25.215 --> 01:49:30.840]  They stopped a whole bunch of the bombings, but not the one that almost took down the World Trade Centers.
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:34.662]  So very, very important book for folks to read.
[01:49:34.662 --> 01:49:41.428]  Before we go any further, I wanna remind listeners that we have got one of our most popular products back in stock.
[01:49:42.558 --> 01:49:44.379]  And that is deep cleanse.
[01:49:44.379 --> 01:49:48.683]  It's got the shilaji from the high mountains of Tibet.
[01:49:50.612 --> 01:50:00.839]  That comes out of the Himalayas that is thousands of years of concentrated, thousands of different compounds, herbs that concentrate into the rocks and then seeps out.
[01:50:00.839 --> 01:50:02.860]  One of the ultimate cleansers out there.
[01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:06.403]  Also, of course, reportedly has these anabolic effects we've talked a lot about.
[01:50:06.403 --> 01:50:09.705]  All I know is it really has made my life a lot better.
[01:50:09.705 --> 01:50:15.990]  Read the rave reviews at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com and listen.
[01:50:16.770 --> 01:50:21.893]  This will be our number one bestseller, but we can't get enough of the Organic Shilajit.
[01:50:21.893 --> 01:50:23.655]  This is our third run.
[01:50:23.655 --> 01:50:24.675]  It will sell out.
[01:50:24.675 --> 01:50:28.978]  It will be months till we get more, and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[01:50:28.978 --> 01:50:29.598]  Deep Cleanse.
[01:50:29.598 --> 01:50:35.442]  It has the Shilajit and a bunch of other known compounds to detoxify and cleanse out the body.
[01:50:35.442 --> 01:50:36.523]  Deep Cleanse.
[01:50:36.523 --> 01:50:38.784]  We've got, of course, Survival Shilnation Iodine X2.
[01:50:39.945 --> 01:50:42.068]  And many, many other products.
[01:50:42.068 --> 01:50:54.844]  Also, we have the Prostagard that is just the entire spectrum of things known to be good for the prostate, like Saw Palmetto and more, at half the price of leading competitors that don't even have all these great ingredients.
[01:50:54.844 --> 01:50:55.965]  Game-changing products.
[01:50:55.965 --> 01:50:57.747]  Infowarslife.com.

[01:52:44.710 --> 01:52:48.151]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[01:52:48.151 --> 01:52:55.073]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis, but they're about to lose control.
[01:53:09.978 --> 01:53:15.300]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:19.881]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[01:53:19.881 --> 01:53:22.282]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[01:53:22.282 --> 01:53:26.123]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[01:53:26.123 --> 01:53:30.644]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[01:53:30.644 --> 01:53:33.765]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[01:53:33.765 --> 01:53:36.366]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[01:53:36.366 --> 01:53:37.706]  This will affect us all.
[01:53:38.206 --> 01:53:42.931]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[01:53:42.931 --> 01:53:49.339]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.
[01:53:49.339 --> 01:53:55.445]  You can watch the video for free right now by going to DollarDanger.com.
[01:53:55.445 --> 01:53:57.448]  Again, that's DollarDanger.com.
[01:53:59.758 --> 01:54:04.119]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[01:54:04.119 --> 01:54:05.699]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:54:05.699 --> 01:54:06.159]  to 2 p.m.
[01:54:06.159 --> 01:54:08.080]  Central Standard Time.
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:10.160]  We're here live.
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:28.144]  We are witnessing a treasonous policy so evil two years ago, hundreds of commissioned and non-commissioned officers, as high up as colonels and captains of the Navy, put out images of themselves on Facebook and Twitter holding up signs saying, I will not be al-Qaeda's air force in Syria.
[01:54:30.407 --> 01:54:35.772]  When our government was openly backing rebels that they knew were Al Qaeda.
[01:54:35.772 --> 01:54:41.857]  And Colonel Schaeffer went and testified to Congress in closed session, in committee, we had him on about that, others did.
[01:54:41.857 --> 01:54:47.882]  So it was a great moral moment where our military said we're not going to be part of this.
[01:54:47.882 --> 01:54:51.686]  But the public is ignorant because they're not geopolitically informed.
[01:54:53.516 --> 01:55:08.059]  In what's left of this segment, the next, we're going to be talking to a man who is really a premier expert on this and talk about the Russian airliner down, more on what ISIS is doing, and where he thinks all this is going and ways to stop this.
[01:55:08.059 --> 01:55:15.160]  But briefly, again, Christmas is here, the holidays are here, this is also a time we help fund our operation.
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:19.461]  Every gift we have at InfoWarsTore.com will help wake somebody up.
[01:55:20.606 --> 01:55:26.810]  And one of the things that people use every day that's so effective to wake up friends and family is a coffee cup.
[01:55:26.810 --> 01:55:35.795]  If your friends and family aren't listeners or don't listen routinely and you want to wake them up, send them on InfoWars.com Made in America Coffee Cup.
[01:55:35.795 --> 01:55:36.015]  They're $8.95.
[01:55:38.601 --> 01:55:41.485]  They cost us four dollars made in America.
[01:55:41.485 --> 01:55:44.068]  They cost us a dollar made in China.
[01:55:44.068 --> 01:55:47.873]  We have a Chinese version as well if you choose to buy from China.
[01:55:47.873 --> 01:55:50.075]  I'm not against buying from China as long as it promotes liberty.
[01:55:50.075 --> 01:55:55.822]  But the point is, three of our four cups are made in America.
[01:55:56.778 --> 01:55:59.899]  So we have the little cup that just says Infowars.com.
[01:55:59.899 --> 01:56:00.619]  It's made in China.
[01:56:00.619 --> 01:56:04.240]  The big cups are made in America with Infowars.com.
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:08.481]  And another has a sheepdog chasing a wolf, meaning we're patriots.
[01:56:08.481 --> 01:56:10.721]  We're not predators, but we're not sheep.
[01:56:10.721 --> 01:56:14.782]  And this is a design that I came up with, obviously.
[01:56:14.782 --> 01:56:18.303]  You know, it harkens to the books made popular in the movie.
[01:56:20.444 --> 01:56:26.209]  American Sniper, but that's something I was brought up in Texas and told, you're not a sheep and you're not a wolf, you're a sheepdog.
[01:56:26.209 --> 01:56:28.550]  And so it's a great gift to give friends and family.
[01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:30.112]  It's a very handsome cup.
[01:56:30.112 --> 01:56:32.954]  It's on both sides and people will end up visiting the site.
[01:56:32.954 --> 01:56:33.574]  So you spend...
[01:56:34.747 --> 01:56:38.911]  Eight ninety-five and I'm telling you it is a great gift and you're done.
[01:56:38.911 --> 01:56:46.599]  You buy ten of these, you got your Christmas shopping done, you give people a coffee mug, it's the way to go, and you support the broadcast.
[01:56:46.599 --> 01:56:47.720]  I want to see a lot of these ordered.
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:49.522]  I want to see a lot of these out there.
[01:56:49.522 --> 01:56:51.664]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:51.664 --> 01:56:52.705]  The book On The Run.
[01:56:55.988 --> 01:56:58.510]  And of course you can visit his website.
[01:56:58.510 --> 01:57:00.632]  We've tweeted that out for folks.
[01:57:00.632 --> 01:57:06.057]  But going back to Ahmad Saleem, we've only got a minute or two left in this segment, five in the next.
[01:57:06.057 --> 01:57:09.039]  I want to invite you back on the Nightly News in the near future, sir.
[01:57:09.039 --> 01:57:14.424]  But what's your breakdown on the Russian shoot-down or the Russian bombed plane?
[01:57:16.236 --> 01:57:25.186]  On the Russian bombing, they finally uncovered that it was two pounds of explosive.
[01:57:25.186 --> 01:57:27.848]  Unfortunately, ISIS is playing a game here.
[01:57:27.848 --> 01:57:33.474]  The bomb, they put it on The Peak, which is their magazine.
[01:57:34.395 --> 01:57:36.297]  Cannot be.
[01:57:36.297 --> 01:57:38.560]  The bomb went on that plane.
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:46.569]  I have been in Sharma Sheikh Airport so many times, and I know how secure
[01:57:47.864 --> 01:57:50.085]  That airport is.
[01:57:50.085 --> 01:58:02.508]  But unfortunately, I think that ISIS succeeded to recruit somebody who carrying the luggage in the back of the plane in the cargo area.
[01:58:02.508 --> 01:58:08.970]  And they succeeded to sneak the real bomb, not the one they put it on their website.
[01:58:08.970 --> 01:58:12.651]  And they succeeded to bring this plane down.
[01:58:12.651 --> 01:58:14.972]  And it is the beginning of a new era
[01:58:16.239 --> 01:58:18.900]  Stay there.
[01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:19.840]  Back in 70 seconds, Colonel.
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:20.540]  Stay with us.
[01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:20.900]  Third hour.
[01:58:20.900 --> 01:58:21.981]  Straight ahead.
[01:58:21.981 --> 01:58:23.901]  Then Dr. Corsi.

[02:00:05.407 --> 02:00:06.728]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.728 --> 02:00:08.489]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.489 --> 02:00:10.251]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.251 --> 02:00:11.832]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.832 --> 02:00:13.373]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.373 --> 02:00:17.576]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.576 --> 02:00:21.639]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:45.808 --> 02:00:51.990]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen, final segment with Ahmad Saleem, ahmadsaleem.org.
[02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:58.072]  Barely got in here during the break after printing off articles, going over breaking news we're going to be covering at the start of the next segment.
[02:00:58.072 --> 02:01:04.995]  Colonel, in the last four or five minutes we have left, you have the floor to finish up points and topics that you'd like to relay with your incredible
[02:01:05.535 --> 02:01:06.935]  Breadth and depth of knowledge.
[02:01:06.935 --> 02:01:12.477]  I can't think of someone who could be more informed about what's happening in Egypt, more informed about what's happening in Syria.
[02:01:12.477 --> 02:01:19.959]  You got cut off pointing out that the Syrian people were quote, many of them ingrained with a very deep and then you got cut off.
[02:01:19.959 --> 02:01:21.079]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:21.079 --> 02:01:28.861]  The Syrian refugees, most of them were brought up in a Middle Eastern controlled
[02:01:30.043 --> 02:01:35.787]  Middle Eastern country controlled by the ideology of hating the West.
[02:01:35.787 --> 02:01:39.830]  The West to them is the infidels, unfortunately.
[02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:57.483]  And if we open our doors to them, instead of we go secure our borders to prevent any trespassing on the American borders, we open the doors from the other side by Mr. Obama's decision to let them in.
[02:01:58.383 --> 02:02:05.278]  I just want to mention back what happened in Benghazi.
[02:02:05.278 --> 02:02:08.606]  Benghazi started from Egypt.
[02:02:09.224 --> 02:02:26.916]  Because at that time, simultaneously, when the Benghazi attack was going on, the blind Sheikh's children, which is Dr. Abdullah, they were demonstrating and setting fire in the American Embassy in Cairo.
[02:02:26.916 --> 02:02:33.300]  Our intelligence uncovered and intercepted some communication.
[02:02:33.300 --> 02:02:36.722]  It didn't broadcast it at the time, but since then disappeared.
[02:02:37.623 --> 02:02:48.873]  That they informed their followers in Benghazi to set fire in it, and that's when we lost our ambassador.
[02:02:48.873 --> 02:02:57.601]  It started from Egypt, it ends up in Benghazi, and it was a deal of weapons to this
[02:02:59.124 --> 02:03:06.966]  People who we don't even not sure that this weapons one day if we give it to them it will be used against us.
[02:03:06.966 --> 02:03:25.971]  Unfortunately, we didn't learn from our lesson when we allowed the blind Sheikh to enter the country and he turned against the country and ordering me to go build a bomb and blow up the World Trade Center and build a bomb and go blow it in the army.
[02:03:27.169 --> 02:03:30.432]  And at 96th Street in Manhattan.
[02:03:30.432 --> 02:03:36.317]  So we need to understand that these people talk from both sides of their mouth.
[02:03:36.317 --> 02:03:46.405]  They might say, yes, we are coming to America because we love America, but we have to really understand what are we doing?
[02:03:46.405 --> 02:03:48.507]  Who are we letting in?
[02:03:48.507 --> 02:03:51.229]  And I don't think it's a good idea.
[02:03:51.229 --> 02:03:54.432]  I don't think it is safe for the American people
[02:03:55.052 --> 02:03:59.195]  To let these people to go and roam into our country.
[02:03:59.195 --> 02:04:03.638]  At this time, we have to strengthen our military again.
[02:04:03.638 --> 02:04:07.760]  We have to start to lead, not to be led.
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:12.844]  And not to give time to ISIS to grow.
[02:04:12.844 --> 02:04:17.647]  What happened with ISIS since they were the JV team?
[02:04:17.647 --> 02:04:20.449]  We gave them the time to grow, now they are taking over.
[02:04:21.425 --> 02:04:32.027]  Syria, they are taking over Iraq, they have been in Libya, they went back to Egypt, and they are bombing everywhere, Paris, Germany, and now we want to bring them in!
[02:04:34.367 --> 02:04:37.410]  It just spills catastrophically.
[02:04:37.410 --> 02:04:37.930]  It does.
[02:04:37.930 --> 02:04:38.270]  Wow.
[02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:41.694]  Well, Colonel Ahmad Saleem, thank you for your courage, your amazing analysis.
[02:04:41.694 --> 02:04:43.615]  AhmadSaleem.org.
[02:04:43.615 --> 02:04:46.618]  Folks, get his book, On The Run.
[02:04:46.618 --> 02:04:48.780]  Thank you so much, sir, for joining us today.
[02:04:48.780 --> 02:04:51.482]  Folks, you can find the book at Amazon.com as well.
[02:04:51.482 --> 02:04:53.264]  On The Run, Ahmad Saleem.
[02:04:53.264 --> 02:04:55.826]  Thank you and have a great weekend coming up.
[02:04:55.826 --> 02:04:56.587]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:56.587 --> 02:04:56.867]  Thank you.
[02:04:56.867 --> 02:04:57.828]  We'll be back with Dr. Corsi.
[02:04:59.383 --> 02:05:06.687]  In the second Democrat debate this last weekend, it was the last minute change the day before to talk about foreign policy because of the terrorist attacks.
[02:05:06.687 --> 02:05:09.188]  The Sanders campaign was furious.
[02:05:09.188 --> 02:05:12.050]  Bernie wasn't ready to talk about terrorism.
[02:05:12.050 --> 02:05:16.672]  The moderator asked him if he still thought the greatest threat to national security was climate change.
[02:05:16.672 --> 02:05:17.412]  Absolutely.
[02:05:17.412 --> 02:05:20.514]  In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.
[02:05:20.734 --> 02:05:22.374]  Do you understand what Sanders is saying?
[02:05:22.374 --> 02:05:25.795]  Climate change is directly related to terrorism.
[02:05:25.795 --> 02:05:29.016]  Terrorism has nothing to do with wars for oil and power.
[02:05:29.016 --> 02:05:30.677]  It's not about a clash of cultures.
[02:05:30.677 --> 02:05:34.538]  And as every liberal will tell you, it has nothing to do with Islam.
[02:05:34.538 --> 02:05:36.559]  So it must be climate change.
[02:05:36.559 --> 02:05:37.339]  Bernie!
[02:05:37.339 --> 02:05:41.180]  Al Qaeda and ISIS were not created to fight climate change!
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:43.062]  But there is an indirect link.
[02:05:43.062 --> 02:05:46.027]  Bernie Sanders won't tell you, however, if he even sees it.
[02:05:46.027 --> 02:05:56.381]  Al Qaeda and ISIS are a creation of the same governments and multinational corporations that are trying to create a global government using terrorism and climate change as an excuse.
[02:05:56.381 --> 02:05:58.064]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:05:59.221 --> 02:06:08.946]  Most of the InfoWars radio listening audience is aware of the high-quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at HDFirearms.com.
[02:06:08.946 --> 02:06:15.450]  One of the most exciting things about HDFirearms.com is the ability to upgrade your AR-15 platform today.

[02:06:22.394 --> 02:06:25.175]  6061 Billet Material with Type 3 Hard Coating.
[02:06:25.175 --> 02:06:27.216]  Bolt Carrier Group for .308 and .556 ARs.

[02:06:48.951 --> 02:06:50.211]  That's HDfirearms.com or call 770-485-7015.
[02:06:58.837 --> 02:06:59.758]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[02:06:59.758 --> 02:07:00.338]  Good, brother.
[02:07:00.338 --> 02:07:02.060]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:07:02.060 --> 02:07:04.001]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:07:04.001 --> 02:07:08.045]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:07:08.045 --> 02:07:08.785]  Well, thank you, brother.
[02:07:08.785 --> 02:07:13.089]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:07:13.089 --> 02:07:20.935]  Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:07:21.235 --> 02:07:24.477]  We did a super male and a super female vitality.
[02:07:24.477 --> 02:07:26.038]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:07:26.038 --> 02:07:28.960]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:30.721]  Saved a ton of money there.
[02:07:30.721 --> 02:07:36.524]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated.
[02:07:36.784 --> 02:07:38.565]  Or maximum potency.
[02:07:38.565 --> 02:07:48.769]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going, goes right to the source.
[02:07:48.769 --> 02:07:50.570]  So, it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[02:07:50.570 --> 02:07:57.493]  Visit Infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:08:09.751 --> 02:08:12.333]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:12.333 --> 02:08:14.095]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:33.110 --> 02:08:37.834]  Of radicals, many of which do intend to engage in terror attacks.
[02:08:37.834 --> 02:08:47.441]  This is one of the craziest actions I've ever seen, but I had a big whistleblower on, a former Egyptian army colonel, author of On the Run, Ahmad Salim on.
[02:08:47.441 --> 02:08:50.944]  He's the guy that exposed and tried to stop the first World Trade Center attack.
[02:08:50.944 --> 02:08:54.187]  He stopped five other attacks, but the FBI was ordered to stand down.
[02:08:54.187 --> 02:08:56.929]  He was on saying he believes it'll be another false flag.
[02:08:57.830 --> 02:09:02.014]  This is Obama's false flag to bring these people in to then take our liberties.
[02:09:02.014 --> 02:09:08.360]  Now, folks know I like Donald Trump, and Dr. Zeroom, of course, he knows Donald Trump and has worked with him on a lot of big stories.
[02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:16.687]  But I tell you, Trump has come out and said surveillance state will combat Islam in a Yahoo News interview.
[02:09:16.687 --> 02:09:19.130]  The interview is up on InfoWars.com.
[02:09:19.130 --> 02:09:22.212]  He says databases and special IDs will be issued.
[02:09:22.853 --> 02:09:26.674]  And he says, you know, folks aren't going to like giving up their rights, but basically you have to.
[02:09:26.674 --> 02:09:30.436]  No, you don't let them bring the refugees in.
[02:09:30.436 --> 02:09:35.277]  You go after people with profiling for what they've committed or who they're affiliated with.
[02:09:35.277 --> 02:09:38.058]  You don't go after the entire public.
[02:09:38.058 --> 02:09:39.179]  That is not the answer.
[02:09:39.179 --> 02:09:44.481]  In fact, I've had former head of technical from the NSA in the studio.
[02:09:44.481 --> 02:09:47.002]  And he said more data swamps everything.
[02:09:47.002 --> 02:09:47.982]  They need targeted.
[02:09:48.783 --> 02:09:52.727]  But see, that doesn't let them spend tens of billions a year on no-bid contracts.
[02:09:52.727 --> 02:09:56.671]  There's another article out today about this from RT USA.
[02:09:56.671 --> 02:10:01.196]  Leaked NSA doc reveals sheer luck needed to find useful info and sea of surveillance data.
[02:10:02.816 --> 02:10:06.477]  Well, I have that from Thomas Drake, William Binney, you name it.
[02:10:06.477 --> 02:10:12.518]  Now, of course, Dr. Jerome Corsi is WorldNetDaily.com, WND.com writer.
[02:10:12.518 --> 02:10:15.559]  He's a PhD from Harvard University in political science.
[02:10:15.559 --> 02:10:18.160]  He's also an economist and worked with some of the biggest banks out there.
[02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:23.661]  He's worked as a consultant in terrorism and secretive operations for the State Department.
[02:10:23.661 --> 02:10:27.522]  And, of course, he's the guy that ran the swift boating operation, which was accurate.
[02:10:27.522 --> 02:10:28.062]  I commend him.
[02:10:28.062 --> 02:10:29.482]  I don't even like George Bush.
[02:10:29.482 --> 02:10:32.043]  It's just John Kerry is who they say John Kerry was.
[02:10:32.823 --> 02:10:36.306]  Total Fraud, and he's also written many other best-selling books.
[02:10:36.306 --> 02:10:39.648]  Number one New York Times best-selling book is JeromeCorsi.com.
[02:10:39.648 --> 02:10:44.052]  So, Dr. Corsi, this is even getting too crazy for me to believe.
[02:10:44.052 --> 02:10:47.894]  I've had reporters in France all week.
[02:10:47.894 --> 02:10:55.240]  We see attacks in the U.S., like at Fort Hood and the Army, Navy, Marine Corps recruiting centers not being called terror.
[02:10:55.240 --> 02:10:57.862]  The Garland attack not being called terror.
[02:10:59.238 --> 02:11:05.700]  And as best I can tell from talking to you, talking to Ahmad Salim and many others, Obama's gotten in over his head.
[02:11:05.700 --> 02:11:13.542]  He's been blackmailed through Benghazi, probably blackmailed by the Saudis, by the Turks, and by the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:11:13.542 --> 02:11:19.284]  He's in deep with them, and now it's gone to the level of they basically have a compromise-controlled president.
[02:11:19.284 --> 02:11:23.765]  Whether he's a sleeper cell radical Muslim or not, he might as well be one now.
[02:11:25.626 --> 02:11:27.368]  This is like a science fiction movie.
[02:11:27.368 --> 02:11:29.771]  I can't even believe we're in this much peril.
[02:11:29.771 --> 02:11:34.697]  And every angle I look at, the analysis only goes from bad to worse.
[02:11:34.697 --> 02:11:39.442]  In your expert analysis and what you know, what is really going on right now?
[02:11:39.442 --> 02:11:41.905]  Because this is insane.
[02:11:41.905 --> 02:11:44.728]  Well, I mean, clearly Obama is beginning to embarrass himself.
[02:11:45.969 --> 02:11:48.711]  With his cavalier attitude.
[02:11:48.711 --> 02:11:54.714]  When I wrote Abomination, I pointed out that Obama was raised a Muslim in Indonesia.
[02:11:54.714 --> 02:11:57.475]  He's never renounced that.
[02:11:57.475 --> 02:12:05.739]  Obama, I think, has given every indication that his sympathies continue to be with Islam, and he's making that clear again.
[02:12:05.739 --> 02:12:09.541]  Now, the idea of flooding the United States with
[02:12:10.373 --> 02:12:35.701]  Refugees, as if that somehow excuses, and this is a small number of the people who have been displaced in Syria, when Obama and Hillary Clinton were responsible for destabilizing the Middle East, including destabilizing and destroying what's left of Syria, and suddenly Obama wants to play this guilt trip that we've got to take in Syrian refugees.
[02:12:35.701 --> 02:12:36.441]  It's ridiculous.
[02:12:37.402 --> 02:12:41.964]  The American people aren't going to stand for it because the risk is apparent.
[02:12:41.964 --> 02:12:53.570]  You've got organized ISIS terrorists who are clearly capable of crossing borders, communicating across borders, using encrypted technology, getting into the United States.
[02:12:53.570 --> 02:12:56.191]  Launching simultaneous attacks.
[02:12:56.191 --> 02:13:03.435]  And coordinated in efforts that they persist in when they are thwarted with one attack they plan another.
[02:13:04.279 --> 02:13:07.120]  And not deterred even by law enforcement.
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:15.584]  In fact, law enforcement is going to find it very hard in Europe to get down and to trace all the potential terrorists.
[02:13:15.584 --> 02:13:22.147]  People are traveling freely between Europe and Syria, participating with ISIS, going back to Europe.
[02:13:22.842 --> 02:13:26.205]  A lot of experts say he's mentally ill and has lost
[02:13:44.315 --> 02:13:46.017]  Well, Obama's getting indefensible.
[02:13:46.017 --> 02:13:48.399]  I mean, he says, you know, the day before we get the Paris attacks, that ISIS is contained.
[02:14:09.697 --> 02:14:19.720]  He ridicules the GOP for orphans and widows, and then a woman terrorist bomber blows herself up in Paris.
[02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:24.182]  You know, you've got clearly a president that's out of touch with reality.
[02:14:24.182 --> 02:14:30.484]  And as I said, when I wrote The Obamination, Obama ends up, he starts with a hatred of America.
[02:14:30.484 --> 02:14:34.305]  He's a socialist, he was trained by Frank Marshall Davis as a communist.
[02:14:34.986 --> 02:14:39.328]  Obama was trained also in a Saul Alinsky organization.
[02:14:39.328 --> 02:14:40.849]  He wants a radical revolution.
[02:14:40.849 --> 02:14:43.751]  He wants to weaken the United States by a real abomination.
[02:14:43.751 --> 02:14:51.075]  I predicted that we would have more racial strife in the United States, a weakened America internationally.
[02:14:51.075 --> 02:14:55.677]  We would have terrorism on the increase, all of which has come true.
[02:14:55.677 --> 02:15:02.021]  And Obama, as far as I'm concerned, is carrying out the agenda he was elected saying he would carry out.
[02:15:02.884 --> 02:15:12.576]  But in his crazy leftist, red diaper doper baby world, he really thinks radical socialism and collectivism can ally with radical Islam.
[02:15:12.576 --> 02:15:17.422]  And I know historically it has allied, but I don't get how you get feminists lecturing
[02:15:18.183 --> 02:15:29.932]  Western men, who are the most loving to women out there, undoubtedly, how they hate us, but then they love people that would sexually mutilate them, not let them drive cars and put bags on their heads.
[02:15:29.932 --> 02:15:34.656]  I just don't get what sick freaks these Gloria Steinem people are.
[02:15:34.656 --> 02:15:36.157]  Well, it's bizarre.
[02:15:36.157 --> 02:15:46.785]  I mean, the idea that the left would embrace Islam, it's only because, you know, whoever hates my enemy is my friend, and the left hates America.
[02:15:47.766 --> 02:15:49.757]  Radical left hates America.
[02:15:49.757 --> 02:15:51.085]  Obama airs.
[02:15:52.322 --> 02:15:55.663]  The whole group of the radical left, and that's what's taking over the Democratic Party.
[02:15:55.663 --> 02:15:58.744]  You know, I always hear they hate America, but they really do.
[02:15:58.744 --> 02:15:59.485]  They really do?
[02:15:59.485 --> 02:16:00.865]  I mean, they really do.
[02:16:00.865 --> 02:16:02.886]  It's like mentally ill children that hate their parents.
[02:16:02.886 --> 02:16:06.187]  It's like spoiled rotten brats here that, you know, kill their parents.
[02:16:06.187 --> 02:16:08.408]  This is the exact same type of crap.
[02:16:08.408 --> 02:16:10.129]  Well, it comes down to a self-hatred.
[02:16:10.129 --> 02:16:16.191]  It comes down to fundamental psychological problems, and I'm not a psychiatrist, but they hate America.
[02:16:16.191 --> 02:16:17.291]  They blame America.
[02:16:17.291 --> 02:16:21.393]  They won't credit America with any of the good things America has done in the world.
[02:16:22.165 --> 02:16:31.023]  And as a result, feminists, as you point out, who should loathe Islam for its treatment of women.
[02:16:31.827 --> 02:16:34.729]  Um, basically one of the worst religions in the world.
[02:16:34.729 --> 02:16:45.516]  If you want to call it a religion, and I mean, you know, the way radical Islam is practiced is an ideology, but beating women... Radical Islam is the enslavement of women.
[02:16:45.516 --> 02:16:46.037]  Yes, it is.
[02:16:46.037 --> 02:16:47.618]  There's no question about it.
[02:16:47.618 --> 02:16:50.700]  Radical Islam has no regard for Islam.
[02:16:50.700 --> 02:16:56.744]  It's the, you know, the desired sexual creature, and radical Islam is not a woman.
[02:16:56.744 --> 02:16:58.025]  That's been the reality
[02:16:58.652 --> 02:17:01.034]  For anybody who knows anything about the Middle East.
[02:17:01.034 --> 02:17:02.455]  And this is radical Islam.
[02:17:02.455 --> 02:17:03.616]  These are the extremists.
[02:17:03.616 --> 02:17:06.378]  These are the ones who want Sharia law.
[02:17:06.378 --> 02:17:09.341]  These are the... But they're the ones that are willing to blow themselves up.
[02:17:09.341 --> 02:17:12.744]  And am I right in saying that geopolitically they're gaining ground?
[02:17:12.744 --> 02:17:14.045]  They're becoming dominant Islam?
[02:17:14.565 --> 02:17:19.150]  Well, they are becoming the force of Islam, the vocal force.
[02:17:19.150 --> 02:17:29.141]  As I've said, Islam needs to go through a reformation, but the voices and forces that should be speaking out condemning Islam right now are silent.
[02:17:29.141 --> 02:17:30.722]  This is the problem.
[02:17:30.722 --> 02:17:36.689]  Islam needs to have a reformation and there's no voices in Islam speaking up for that reformation.
[02:17:37.370 --> 02:17:54.519]  And if we have the radical jihadis hijack the religion and take it over, you know, we're going right back to Charles Martel and the Battle of Tours because the Europeans have already once decided that there was nothing they could do with Islam except kill them all and throw them out.
[02:17:54.519 --> 02:17:56.640]  And if Islam wants to go down that path,
[02:17:57.395 --> 02:18:13.799]  With the jihadists, it's going to come to the same... I was about to say, these young radical jihadists that think they're killing a bunch of liberal French and people, if they think that's the real resolve, the veneer of civilization will peel off Europe and the United States very, very quickly, and then it's going to get really, really nasty.
[02:18:13.799 --> 02:18:18.080]  They shouldn't take the weakness of a bunch of liberal college kids for the rest of us.
[02:18:18.749 --> 02:18:31.774]  Well, in fact, you know, of course, you know, Europe is not the spoiled children in colleges today who, you know, want Woodrow Wilson removed from Princeton because they think he was a racist.
[02:18:31.774 --> 02:18:38.536]  I mean, this insanity, these spoiled kids, I don't know how any of them are going to get jobs or how any of them are going to be employable.
[02:18:38.536 --> 02:18:48.000]  But at any rate, the idea that Europe is now, I mean, radical, this attack in Paris has done more to destroy the European Union in one event.
[02:18:48.635 --> 02:18:50.876]  That I could have imagined possible.
[02:18:50.876 --> 02:18:53.016]  And the European Union needs to be destroyed.
[02:18:53.016 --> 02:18:58.158]  This whole idea of eliminating countries and one world government.
[02:18:58.158 --> 02:19:03.099]  It's also ironic, these terrorists are in Brussels, which is the home of one world government.
[02:19:03.099 --> 02:19:04.299]  It's the center!
[02:19:04.299 --> 02:19:04.619]  Center!
[02:19:04.619 --> 02:19:14.902]  It's where the EU, you know, the nameless... My reporters were there yesterday, tried to go in restaurants, tried to walk, and were just screamed at and run out three times.
[02:19:14.902 --> 02:19:18.123]  Well, the European Union is going to quickly change.
[02:19:18.849 --> 02:19:27.214]  Because when people are this, if you can't go to a restaurant, you can't go to a concert, you can't go to a mall, innocent victims are being slaughtered.
[02:19:27.214 --> 02:19:28.235]  And this was slaughter.
[02:19:28.235 --> 02:19:31.296]  This was not, this was no noble attack.
[02:19:31.296 --> 02:19:42.923]  This was cowardly slaughter in no gun zones, which they knew were free of anybody in the terrorist being opposed when they were doing their merciless attacks.
[02:19:42.923 --> 02:19:44.204]  Dr. Corsi, we got to go to WND.com.
[02:19:46.980 --> 02:19:48.241]  Jerome, of course, he's our guest.
[02:19:48.241 --> 02:19:51.365]  When we come back, I'm going to ask him, how much more dangerous will Obama get?
[02:19:51.365 --> 02:19:54.468]  I mean, here's the headline on Drudge, Limbaugh, Obama has become dangerous.
[02:19:54.468 --> 02:19:58.372]  I think that's what everybody gets now, that, wow, he really is out to get us.

[02:21:58.820 --> 02:22:05.906]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country.
[02:22:05.906 --> 02:22:09.909]  It caught me totally by surprise, and it involves FEMA.
[02:22:09.909 --> 02:22:13.312]  I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I saw proof.
[02:22:13.312 --> 02:22:18.396]  Revealing their secret could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.

[02:24:13.730 --> 02:24:17.732]  The toll-free number to join us when we come back in the next segment after Dr. Corsi leaves us is 800-259-9231.
[02:24:22.594 --> 02:24:25.015]  How dangerous do you think Obama has become?
[02:24:25.015 --> 02:24:31.557]  I think he was always dangerous, but now I really do see that he's moving even faster than I thought possible.
[02:24:31.557 --> 02:24:33.338]  800-259-9231.
[02:24:33.338 --> 02:24:37.599]  House bill to bar Syrian refugees from U.S.
[02:24:37.599 --> 02:24:39.560]  without more vetting just passed.
[02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:44.241]  The House is probably believed to be set to pass the Senate.
[02:24:44.241 --> 02:24:48.262]  It passed 289 to 137 by wide margin.
[02:24:48.262 --> 02:24:49.242]  Politically popular.
[02:24:49.242 --> 02:24:52.662]  Obama says that he'll just veto it.
[02:24:52.662 --> 02:24:54.263]  But what happens when there's a terror attack?
[02:24:54.263 --> 02:24:56.623]  Then he's directly responsible.
[02:24:56.623 --> 02:24:58.664]  This is unprecedented.
[02:24:58.664 --> 02:25:00.804]  Dr. Corsi, he's got to be blackmailed.
[02:25:00.804 --> 02:25:03.605]  I mean, there's no reason for him to be doing this politically.
[02:25:03.605 --> 02:25:04.805]  The optics are so bad.
[02:25:05.509 --> 02:25:11.793]  Well, I mean, I continue to say and have always said that Obama's sympathies are Muslim.
[02:25:11.793 --> 02:25:13.374]  I've written extensively about it.
[02:25:13.374 --> 02:25:18.438]  I think Obama has always worn this ring which has the Shahada on it.
[02:25:18.438 --> 02:25:19.819]  I still believe that's the case.
[02:25:20.521 --> 02:25:36.092]  I know the White House tried to alter the ring, but Obama was wearing this wedding ring, which is from Indonesia with, looks to me, Muslim inscriptions on it, since he was in college, long before he was married.
[02:25:36.092 --> 02:25:42.116]  I mean, even at Harvard Law School, they do a joke law review issue every year.
[02:25:42.116 --> 02:25:47.500]  They were mocking Obama about this Muslim ring that he wouldn't explain why he was wearing it.
[02:25:48.220 --> 02:25:54.023]  I mean, Obama, I think, sympathies have been Islam and he's telegraphed in any number of ways.
[02:25:54.023 --> 02:26:07.209]  I mean, I don't know what he may, for all I know, I may be an atheist at heart, but the point is he was raised a Muslim, he's never renounced the religion, and I think he wants to expand, you know, the chaos in the Middle East.
[02:26:07.941 --> 02:26:17.807]  for his own goals of reducing the power and influence of the United States and his leftist agenda of revolutionary transformation of the United States.
[02:26:17.807 --> 02:26:19.188]  Let me ask this question.
[02:26:19.188 --> 02:26:23.570]  What you wrote about seven, eight years ago about Obama has all come true, so we'll give you that again.
[02:26:23.570 --> 02:26:25.011]  You've been right, doctor.
[02:26:25.011 --> 02:26:27.433]  But how are the elites allowing this?
[02:26:27.433 --> 02:26:32.175]  I know there's not one elite, but there are different elites who've become very powerful off of American
[02:26:33.756 --> 02:26:46.119]  I think you're seeing in Europe the beginning of the end of the political correctness, at least a correction in it.
[02:26:46.119 --> 02:26:54.381]  I mean, in Europe, as I say, this one attack has done more to bring the EU to an end than I thought possible.
[02:26:54.381 --> 02:27:02.783]  I think the EU is seeing a swing of the pendulum over to more conservative parties that want security
[02:27:03.348 --> 02:27:10.711]  That want to eliminate this multicultural nonsense, this multicultural nightmare that Europe has become.
[02:27:10.711 --> 02:27:11.931]  The loss of identity.
[02:27:11.931 --> 02:27:15.572]  I mean, you know, Europe is becoming a Muslim nation.
[02:27:15.572 --> 02:27:22.655]  And what they don't understand is that Islam reaches a critical percentage, like they're in Sharia law.
[02:27:23.758 --> 02:27:25.139]  And they'll lie about it.
[02:27:25.139 --> 02:27:27.041]  They'll lie about what their true intentions are.
[02:27:27.041 --> 02:27:49.538]  Unfortunately, the radical Islamists that are currently in control and in the ascendancy, and what you're going to quickly see the United States and I think Russia combine to do, with or without Obama, is, you know, the basic idea of massive retaliation throughout the Middle East.
[02:27:49.538 --> 02:27:51.700]  You know, if Islam wants to put
[02:27:52.580 --> 02:28:00.200]  The civilized world, Europe and the United States, under the condition that these people need to all be eliminated and killed.
[02:28:01.179 --> 02:28:11.949]  I think you're going to be surprised to find the Europeans willing to turn the Middle East into glass with nuclear weapons before they allow themselves to have more terrorist attacks like they did in Paris.
[02:28:11.949 --> 02:28:15.232]  I think this is going to backfire against the radicals.
[02:28:15.232 --> 02:28:16.293]  Sure, and you can argue the U.S.
[02:28:16.293 --> 02:28:17.834]  has done some bad stuff in the Middle East.
[02:28:17.834 --> 02:28:20.277]  Europe's pretty much been out of there for 50 years.
[02:28:20.277 --> 02:28:22.278]  So this is really picking a fight here.
[02:28:22.278 --> 02:28:24.480]  Dr. Corsi, you've got a minute and a half.
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:25.902]  Obama caused this.
[02:28:25.902 --> 02:28:27.283]  This is what people have got to remember.
[02:28:27.683 --> 02:28:33.627]  Hillary and Obama sided with Al-Qaeda and destabilized Libya.
[02:28:33.627 --> 02:28:36.129]  They were bringing weapons in through Benghazi.
[02:28:36.129 --> 02:28:39.391]  That's what Chris, our ambassador, was doing there.
[02:28:39.391 --> 02:28:41.072]  And that caused the chain reaction?
[02:28:41.072 --> 02:28:43.634]  Caused the chain reaction, destabilized Syria.
[02:28:43.634 --> 02:28:51.459]  This is the result of a conscious policy by Obama and Hillary that is at their doorstep.
[02:28:51.459 --> 02:28:52.520]  They caused the destabilization.
[02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:53.401]  So they are the authors.
[02:28:53.401 --> 02:28:54.782]  They should be held accountable.
[02:28:54.782 --> 02:28:55.442]  Precisely.
[02:28:55.442 --> 02:28:56.383]  I agree entirely.
[02:28:57.233 --> 02:28:59.315]  I know you said you could hold on a little bit longer.
[02:28:59.315 --> 02:29:13.126]  I want to do five minutes, then we'll let you go, Dr. Corsi, on the other side of this break, because I've got to ask you, because you've been so frighteningly accurate, I mean, I'll be honest, I had you on 10 years ago, or 15 years ago, but I thought you were smart, but I just didn't believe at all what you predicted.
[02:29:13.126 --> 02:29:15.848]  It's actually coming true like a crystal ball.
[02:29:15.848 --> 02:29:20.532]  So I want to ask you when we come back, what do you expect Obama to do in his last year in office?
[02:29:20.532 --> 02:29:21.993]  What do we do to try to stop him?
[02:29:22.994 --> 02:29:25.555]  How far will Congress go in letting him go crazy?
[02:29:25.555 --> 02:29:29.756]  I mean, there's gotta be, for the first time ever, I'm beyond scared.
[02:29:29.756 --> 02:29:33.498]  It's more just like, ready to take action.
[02:29:33.498 --> 02:29:43.601]  I mean, I don't know what I'm supposed to do to stop this, but I know for my family's sake, I need to get even more aggressive with these people because they are just crazy criminals.
[02:29:43.601 --> 02:29:46.562]  They're just, they're like psychopaths or something.
[02:29:46.562 --> 02:29:48.263]  I want to get your take on what they're going to do next.
[02:29:48.769 --> 02:29:51.770]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.770 --> 02:29:59.431]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.431 --> 02:30:05.913]  While the government claims the tetanus vaccine is perfectly safe, the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association disagrees.
[02:30:05.913 --> 02:30:14.395]  They're charging UNICEF and the World Health Organization with sterilizing millions of girls and women under cover of an anti-tetanus vaccination program.
[02:30:14.775 --> 02:30:16.476]  Sponsored by the Kenyan government.
[02:30:16.476 --> 02:30:21.777]  The association had six tetanus vaccinations from around Kenya tested.
[02:30:21.777 --> 02:30:25.199]  100% of them tested positive for the HCG antigen.
[02:30:25.199 --> 02:30:34.142]  HCG is a pregnancy hormone developed by the World Health Organization in 1992 and it's commonly used in anti-fertility vaccines.
[02:30:34.142 --> 02:30:39.783]  A spokesman for the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association said this proved right our worst fears.
[02:30:39.783 --> 02:30:44.245]  That this World Health Organization campaign is not about eradicating neonatal tetanus.
[02:30:44.525 --> 02:30:53.252]  But a well-coordinated, forceful population control mass sterilization exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine.
[02:30:53.252 --> 02:30:58.116]  Read more about the mass vaccination program right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:30:59.261 --> 02:31:02.762]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:02.762 --> 02:31:11.025]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:11.025 --> 02:31:16.426]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:31:16.426 --> 02:31:18.947]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[02:31:37.441 --> 02:31:39.141]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[02:31:39.141 --> 02:31:40.722]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:31:40.722 --> 02:31:44.223]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:31:44.223 --> 02:31:46.183]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:31:46.183 --> 02:31:47.123]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:31:47.123 --> 02:31:48.304]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:31:48.304 --> 02:31:50.304]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[02:31:59.066 --> 02:32:02.591]  Infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[02:32:02.591 --> 02:32:08.178]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[02:32:08.178 --> 02:32:16.088]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[02:32:16.548 --> 02:32:22.673]  Sourced from top-leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[02:32:22.673 --> 02:32:31.759]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:32:31.759 --> 02:32:37.983]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[02:32:37.983 --> 02:32:44.248]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:32:44.728 --> 02:32:50.112]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[02:32:54.756 --> 02:32:55.897]  Another world.
[02:32:55.897 --> 02:32:56.998]  Another time.
[02:32:56.998 --> 02:33:01.001]  In the age of wonder.
[02:33:27.758 --> 02:33:53.694]  Coming up, whistleblowers claim the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, rushed contentious climate paper despite reservations that it was a fraud, feds approved genetically engineered salmon for human consumption, frankenfish,
[02:33:54.514 --> 02:33:58.716]  That's just some of the news we've got coming up.
[02:33:58.716 --> 02:34:01.878]  Hillary Clinton is criticizing a comedian that made fun of her.
[02:34:01.878 --> 02:34:03.959]  She's saying Bernie Sanders is sexist again.
[02:34:03.959 --> 02:34:06.980]  I mean, this is just, you know, I think this is what it's come down to.
[02:34:06.980 --> 02:34:19.427]  I know that leftist ideology and collectivism is such garbage historically that I just can't believe that practitioners of it believe it when they're worth hundreds of millions of dollars like Hillary Clinton.
[02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:22.641]  Or Barack Obama.
[02:34:22.641 --> 02:34:27.303]  But I think Obama, more than Hillary, actually smokes the dope.
[02:34:27.303 --> 02:34:32.366]  And actually has the chips on the shoulder, even though he's had the silver spoon life.
[02:34:32.366 --> 02:34:37.588]  And I guess there's a certain vandalism against the West, I don't know what you call it.
[02:34:37.588 --> 02:34:46.773]  So Dr. Corsi, in closing, Dr. Jerome Corsi of WND.com, WorldNetDaily, in closing, what do you expect Obama to do in the next year in office?
[02:34:48.231 --> 02:34:49.652]  How do we stop it?
[02:34:49.652 --> 02:34:51.673]  What should we be looking for next?
[02:34:51.673 --> 02:34:55.575]  Well, I think Obama cannot be trusted to defend the United States.
[02:34:55.575 --> 02:35:01.578]  I think he's going to do everything he can to get Iran nuclear weapons.
[02:35:01.578 --> 02:35:08.782]  Iran's going to advance very fast in its accumulation of uranium and its advance in nuclear technology.
[02:35:08.782 --> 02:35:10.203]  Obama will do nothing to stop it.
[02:35:10.883 --> 02:35:17.189]  I think Obama's going to essentially throw Hillary under the bus, blame Hillary for the Middle East.
[02:35:17.189 --> 02:35:29.899]  I believe Hillary Clinton will be under criminal indictment before the election, likely both from the Department of Justice and also in the states.
[02:35:30.643 --> 02:35:34.544]  Bill and Hillary Clinton are going to be prosecuted in the states for the foundation.
[02:35:34.544 --> 02:35:37.905]  They're going to lose control over the foundation.
[02:35:37.905 --> 02:35:41.407]  The Democrats, I think, have resolved that they're going to lose this election.
[02:35:41.407 --> 02:35:45.228]  Hillary's been picked to take the fall.
[02:35:45.228 --> 02:35:52.310]  Reminds me of 1952 when the Democrats knew Adlai Stevenson was going to lose and no serious Democrats would win.
[02:35:52.310 --> 02:35:53.831]  Just like the Eisenhower situation.
[02:35:54.331 --> 02:36:00.777]  And Obama's going to clean out the old Hillary Clinton wing of the Democratic Party, all the old Democrats.
[02:36:00.777 --> 02:36:03.219]  So he is involved, I've heard that from other insiders.
[02:36:03.219 --> 02:36:06.322]  There is an Obama coup over the Clinton machine.
[02:36:06.322 --> 02:36:06.682]  Absolutely.
[02:36:06.682 --> 02:36:08.243]  Obama's going to take the Clintons down.
[02:36:08.243 --> 02:36:14.569]  Obama will not let the Clintons have control of the White House, which means control of the Democratic Party.
[02:36:14.569 --> 02:36:16.330]  This is going to be the demise of the
[02:36:17.131 --> 02:36:21.233]  What's left of the centrist wing of the Democratic Party is going to stop.
[02:36:21.233 --> 02:36:24.774]  Wow, so as bad as they are, doctor, you're saying it's about to get even more radical?
[02:36:24.774 --> 02:36:27.095]  Yeah, it's going to get more radical.
[02:36:27.095 --> 02:36:43.581]  And they're going to try to align with the forces in the universities to do an Ayers-style revolution, which will mean opening the borders, rushing to the end of a new world order, climate change, all the things that Obama has predicted will want to do, he's going to rush to do.
[02:36:44.361 --> 02:36:45.222]  It's going to fail.
[02:36:45.222 --> 02:36:48.804]  I think there will be more terrorist attacks in Europe.
[02:36:48.804 --> 02:36:52.907]  I think there's going to be terrorist attacks in the United States and ultimately Donald Trump.
[02:36:52.907 --> 02:36:54.949]  It's all going to benefit Donald Trump.
[02:36:54.949 --> 02:36:58.071]  Donald Trump's numbers are going to continue to rise very soon.
[02:36:58.071 --> 02:36:59.912]  I think you'll see Donald Trump over 50%.
[02:36:59.912 --> 02:37:04.435]  You're going to see more and more terrorists stopped at the border.
[02:37:04.435 --> 02:37:06.997]  You're going to see more and more criminal activity.
[02:37:06.997 --> 02:37:11.581]  The country is going to close the border and the country may start throwing out
[02:37:12.421 --> 02:37:19.644]  Muslims in Europe and the United States if Obama continues to press this agenda.
[02:37:19.644 --> 02:37:25.066]  I think Obama will settle for cleansing the Democratic Party of the centrists, the Clintons.
[02:37:25.066 --> 02:37:26.687]  Make sure they're prosecuted.
[02:37:26.687 --> 02:37:28.808]  The Clinton Foundation is in its last days.
[02:37:28.808 --> 02:37:32.430]  It will be put under receivership by one or more of the states.
[02:37:32.430 --> 02:37:37.592]  Clintons will lose control of the foundation and the Democratic Party will move far to the left.
[02:37:40.845 --> 02:37:41.345]  I tell you.
[02:37:51.306 --> 02:37:57.832]  Recession, global depression, the debt bomb is going to explode in the United States and Europe.
[02:37:57.832 --> 02:37:59.093]  Obama set that up.
[02:37:59.093 --> 02:38:02.096]  Obama's been borrowing money, doubling the debt.
[02:38:02.096 --> 02:38:04.158]  That's all going to come to roost.
[02:38:04.158 --> 02:38:11.004]  We'll be into another 2008 or more severe recession when interest rates start rising.
[02:38:11.004 --> 02:38:15.649]  Stock market could easily lose four or five thousand points.
[02:38:15.649 --> 02:38:16.329]  Well, I tell you,
[02:38:17.429 --> 02:38:29.716]  I have to say that I know there's a CFR and globalists and they want global government and I've talked to a lot of smart people like you and they said, look, the leftists plan on double-crossing the professors, the think tanks plan on double-crossing the elites.
[02:38:29.716 --> 02:38:43.343]  And I think the elites are starting to figure that out, that they didn't just use radicalism and leftist ideology to scramble the country and divide and conquer, that there are leftist factions that are going to go for everything.
[02:38:44.079 --> 02:38:54.121]  And I just can't believe that the rich elites, that the West made them so rich that they would create these horrible organizations that now even threaten them.
[02:38:54.121 --> 02:38:58.522]  And I just hope the establishment, I know it's a diverse establishment, has figured this out.
[02:38:58.522 --> 02:39:00.682]  I mean, I'm starting to get some inklings of that.
[02:39:00.682 --> 02:39:02.342]  Are you getting any inklings like that?
[02:39:02.342 --> 02:39:06.803]  That maybe there's some elites in the West that don't want to commit political suicide?
[02:39:06.803 --> 02:39:07.403]  Well, there are.
[02:39:07.403 --> 02:39:09.043]  They're thinking about it very seriously.
[02:39:09.043 --> 02:39:10.904]  But the Clintons are criminals.
[02:39:12.475 --> 02:39:15.231]  And they're going to go down, they're going to be thrown down, they're going to be thrown down hard.
[02:39:16.147 --> 02:39:19.248]  When Clintons go down, a lot of the people who are around them are going to go down.
[02:39:19.248 --> 02:39:23.831]  There will be multiple prosecutions of the Clinton and their close associates.
[02:39:23.831 --> 02:39:31.874]  It's going to spring into Wall Street and the list of people being published, like the Washington Post, the people who back Clinton, are all going to back away from them.
[02:39:31.874 --> 02:39:33.615]  They're all going to get scared.
[02:39:33.615 --> 02:39:35.816]  They're all going to stop funding them.
[02:39:35.816 --> 02:39:43.380]  The criminal elite, which has been what Clinton has cultivated, is going to be ultimately hunted down much more than it has been.
[02:39:44.764 --> 02:40:01.611]  And the New World Order crowd, I think, is going to be very surprised by the reaction of a revival on the right and a demand for closed borders, a demand for return to family, the LGBT agenda, all of these extremes to which it had gotten.
[02:40:01.611 --> 02:40:03.132]  The left overplayed its hand.
[02:40:04.122 --> 02:40:06.344]  And I think is now in for a severe setback.
[02:40:06.344 --> 02:40:07.785]  The left knows it.
[02:40:07.785 --> 02:40:14.049]  The left is going to let the Clintons take the fall, regroup, and in eight years the left will try to rise again.
[02:40:14.049 --> 02:40:23.016]  I think that's what's... I think Obama knows it, Valerie Jarrett knows it, that no serious person on the left is running in the Democratic Party.
[02:40:23.016 --> 02:40:29.321]  You've got the Elizabeth Warren saying, we'll wait out 2016, let Hillary go down hard,
[02:40:30.854 --> 02:40:38.698]  Put up Biden, whomever else he'll lose, and then we'll regroup four or eight years when we have a chance to come back and do it the right way.
[02:40:38.698 --> 02:40:57.106]  I agree with you, and it's key that patriots, libertarians, constitutionalists don't let the old rhinos come in and destroy this opportunity that we try to save the country, reform it, cut the taxes, cut the spending, turn the engine up, rebuild our infrastructure, rebuild our military, and try to restore the republic.
[02:40:57.566 --> 02:41:03.249]  And I think the elites would be smarter doing that than this whole globalist operation that is in the end going to destroy them as well.
[02:41:03.249 --> 02:41:19.417]  And I'll tell you one reason that I've been so against Black Lives Matter and other groups is they're so clearly controlled by Soros is that I've learned in the last few years that the government, the military, even the FBI, you name it, these agencies now are really awake to what's going on.
[02:41:19.417 --> 02:41:24.800]  They've always had problems and corruption, but they really want to go after the corrupt people in government.
[02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:26.620]  They don't want to be corrupt.
[02:41:26.620 --> 02:41:28.281]  They don't want to ruin the country.
[02:41:28.281 --> 02:41:39.303]  And they're just waiting for the American people to give them the opportunity, with the grand juries, with the states and others, to really bring justice to the criminal elite that you mentioned.
[02:41:39.303 --> 02:41:41.884]  And so we are at a major crossroads.
[02:41:41.884 --> 02:41:47.325]  I think the next 14-15 months, don't you agree, is going to decide so much the future of this country.
[02:41:47.705 --> 02:41:48.566]  And the world!
[02:41:48.566 --> 02:41:54.512]  I think you're going to see people like Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi under criminal investigation.
[02:41:54.512 --> 02:41:57.595]  I think you're going to see it extended to the leadership of the Republican Party.
[02:41:57.595 --> 02:42:04.483]  I think the grassroots of the Republican Party is going to reject the Washington wino leadership.
[02:42:04.483 --> 02:42:09.828]  And Wall Street's going to have to decide how much longer it wants to play this leftist game.
[02:42:10.609 --> 02:42:17.255]  If Wall Street continues to play it, when the economy turns around, there's going to be a massive sweeping out of Wall Street.
[02:42:17.255 --> 02:42:26.163]  Because this entire Goldman Sachs engineered debt structure, with the Obama doubling our debt, is going to come crashing down.
[02:42:26.163 --> 02:42:27.524]  And it was the Clintons that engineered that.
[02:42:27.944 --> 02:42:30.285]  Well, and it goes even, you know, it goes way back.
[02:42:30.285 --> 02:42:39.991]  I mean, Greenspan was, you know, beginning... But sure, but wasn't it Larry, because you're the expert in banking, wasn't it Larry Summers and the Clintons that really green-lighted the crazy derivatives?
[02:42:39.991 --> 02:42:46.195]  Yeah, well, the derivatives were going... Summers and the others said, we don't have to worry about debt.
[02:42:46.195 --> 02:42:48.396]  The Paul Krugmans and the others.
[02:42:48.396 --> 02:42:49.677]  Have as much debt as you want.
[02:42:49.677 --> 02:42:50.297]  Debt's good.
[02:42:50.297 --> 02:42:52.378]  You know, all this, basically,
[02:42:55.120 --> 02:43:00.062]  Return to fundamental economics of spend, spend, spend.
[02:43:00.062 --> 02:43:02.924]  And debt, debt, debt is okay.
[02:43:02.924 --> 02:43:14.470]  And I think that all that economics, we're going to see a repudiation of the entire economics of the post-war era come crashing down in this debt structure.
[02:43:14.470 --> 02:43:20.474]  And Wall Street's going to come and have a comeuppance with it as well, as will the Republican establishment.
[02:43:20.474 --> 02:43:22.335]  The country is in, yes, there's going to be
[02:43:23.283 --> 02:43:23.363]  No.
[02:43:40.461 --> 02:43:46.844]  Now he's just throwing a fit, overplaying it that much more with arrogance and disconnected from reality.
[02:43:46.844 --> 02:43:47.824]  Stunning analysis.
[02:43:47.824 --> 02:43:55.147]  I think this was the best interview ever, Dr. Corsi, but obviously we're in very, very dangerous times, so the information is going to be hardcore.
[02:43:55.147 --> 02:43:56.328]  Very powerful interview.
[02:43:56.328 --> 02:43:59.149]  We'll be reading your articles at WND.com.
[02:43:59.149 --> 02:43:59.549]  Thank you, sir.
[02:44:00.009 --> 02:44:00.509]  My pleasure.
[02:44:00.509 --> 02:44:01.310]  Thank you, Al.
[02:44:01.310 --> 02:44:02.370]  Alex, thank you very much.
[02:44:02.370 --> 02:44:03.351]  Thank you.
[02:44:03.351 --> 02:44:05.953]  Yeah, I mean, folks, this isn't rhetoric here.
[02:44:05.953 --> 02:44:09.094]  I've gone past the hair on the back of my neck standing up at this point.
[02:44:09.094 --> 02:44:12.957]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[02:44:12.957 --> 02:44:15.258]  I mean, this is crazy town.
[02:44:15.258 --> 02:44:23.463]  When you've got weirdo Nazi collaborators running basically the media and the government and trying to shut down free speech and
[02:44:25.680 --> 02:44:29.742]  Funding, putting transvestite bathrooms in the first grade.
[02:44:29.742 --> 02:44:33.444]  I mean, it's just Twilight Zone how nuts these people are.
[02:44:33.444 --> 02:44:38.507]  And then they're just radicalizing Muslims and funding Al-Qaeda.
[02:44:38.507 --> 02:44:40.968]  Reuters, three weeks ago, I remember I read that headline like 20 times.
[02:44:40.968 --> 02:44:51.354]  It was, White House criticizes Russia for bombing moderate rebels, Al-Nusra slash Al-Qaeda.
[02:44:51.354 --> 02:44:52.915]  The moderate Al-Qaeda.
[02:44:52.915 --> 02:44:54.956]  I mean, you know, how dare you bomb Al-Qaeda?
[02:44:56.118 --> 02:44:57.219]  I mean, I'm reading this!
[02:44:57.219 --> 02:45:04.823]  I'm reading, you know, National Poll Democrats want to arrest those that deny man-made climate change.
[02:45:04.823 --> 02:45:06.825]  That was two days ago.
[02:45:06.825 --> 02:45:07.845]  They're freaks, people!
[02:45:07.845 --> 02:45:10.627]  They're total crazies!
[02:45:10.627 --> 02:45:17.711]  That's not liberal to want to arrest me for my speech, you crazies!
[02:45:17.711 --> 02:45:23.255]  I used to say, they're not crazy, they're not crazy, they're not crazy, they've taken over, there's a method to their madness, they're not crazy.
[02:45:25.327 --> 02:45:30.150]  At a certain point on a power trip, someone who's not crazy becomes crazy.
[02:45:30.150 --> 02:45:39.557]  At a certain point, bravada, chutzpah, arrogance, hubris, whatever you want to call it, becomes mania.
[02:45:39.557 --> 02:45:52.886]  I mean, as I've gotten a little more power and reach, and let's face it, the show has a lot of power, it's scary, I've gotten less confident, less mindless, more humanitarian, I guess you should say.
[02:45:52.886 --> 02:45:54.046]  I mean, I was pretty arrogant when I was 22.
[02:45:55.370 --> 02:45:59.752]  With a radio show, you know, weeknights in a major city.
[02:45:59.752 --> 02:46:01.993]  But compared to these people, I was never arrogant.
[02:46:01.993 --> 02:46:04.094]  I mean, these people are nuts!
[02:46:04.094 --> 02:46:07.595]  And you know, your arrogance can only take you so far.
[02:46:07.595 --> 02:46:12.618]  And the smarter you get, the more you realize arrogance is your weakness.
[02:46:12.618 --> 02:46:15.179]  I'm going to go to break and come back with your phone calls, or maybe I'll go to them right now.
[02:46:15.179 --> 02:46:18.821]  I've got a few minutes before break.
[02:46:18.821 --> 02:46:21.862]  The optics of everything the globalists are doing is bad.
[02:46:23.680 --> 02:46:26.462]  Like the Pope coming out and announcing world government.
[02:46:26.462 --> 02:46:30.185]  And they still have news articles saying no world government exists.
[02:46:30.185 --> 02:46:36.009]  Don't people know that only makes our credibility rocket?
[02:46:36.009 --> 02:46:42.693]  And the average person in government is not the enemy, because big government's the problem, but people in government aren't the enemy.
[02:46:42.693 --> 02:46:44.895]  On average, I've talked to them, they're more awake than the public.
[02:46:44.895 --> 02:46:47.697]  They know how corrupt it is.
[02:46:47.697 --> 02:46:50.519]  I mean, there are a lot of good people in America and in the world.
[02:46:51.641 --> 02:46:55.623]  And I've really had a chance to discover that.
[02:46:55.623 --> 02:46:59.265]  And we've got a lot of hope, but at the same time, we've got a lot of danger.
[02:46:59.265 --> 02:47:02.167]  Briefly, you know, we fund this operation with your purchases.
[02:47:02.167 --> 02:47:05.029]  We're not like MSNBC, they've got billions of stimulus money.
[02:47:05.029 --> 02:47:13.594]  They're NBC of taxpayer money, or NPR, 440-something million a year, and they beg for money every week, and have Rockefeller Foundation and Ford Foundation funding.
[02:47:13.594 --> 02:47:15.015]  There's no foundations here.
[02:47:15.015 --> 02:47:17.576]  It's you, the people of America and the world.
[02:47:17.576 --> 02:47:20.598]  We try to bring you the very best products at the very lowest prices.
[02:47:21.853 --> 02:47:27.395]  If you'll just try the Nacin Iodine and see it for yourself.
[02:47:27.395 --> 02:47:30.896]  If you'll just try the Deep Cleanse that's now back in stock.
[02:47:30.896 --> 02:47:32.737]  It is our best seller.
[02:47:32.737 --> 02:47:37.919]  Technically it's not because we can't ever keep it in stock and can't get enough of the Shilajit.
[02:47:37.919 --> 02:47:47.943]  If you'll just try the Oxy Powder, if you'll just try the Prostagard or the True Oil of Oregano that we have, the Mediterranean type.
[02:47:50.313 --> 02:47:52.794]  It's amazing what it's done.
[02:47:52.794 --> 02:48:02.458]  If you'll just try the Secret 12 Mevel Kabalamin, or if you'll just go check out the G-Shock survival watches that we have at the lowest price you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:48:02.458 --> 02:48:04.558]  You can find counterfeits, I guess, for less.
[02:48:04.558 --> 02:48:07.279]  It will then fund our operation, and you'll get great products.
[02:48:07.279 --> 02:48:12.841]  And this Christmas, this holiday season, shopping with the Patriots is more essential than ever.
[02:48:12.841 --> 02:48:19.064]  If you fund us, we'll just grow more in the face of the tyrants until we defeat them, with your help, together, or they crush us.
[02:48:19.943 --> 02:48:23.145]  We win either way in the Animating Contest for Liberty.
[02:48:23.145 --> 02:48:26.808]  So Deep Cleanse by Infowars Lime is back in stock after selling out months ago.
[02:48:26.808 --> 02:48:34.493]  In just a few days, our newest run is still in limited supply and it's extremely hard to procure the organic ingredients that make Deep Cleanse so special.
[02:48:34.493 --> 02:48:40.937]  Deep Cleanse uses nano-colloidal zeolites and organic compounds to aid, like Shilajit, in the body in true cleansing.
[02:48:41.397 --> 02:48:45.098]  It's the best all-in-one product by InfoWarsLife to help the body cleanse itself naturally.
[02:48:45.098 --> 02:48:56.262]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades of scientific research, put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing at a very, very low cost.
[02:48:56.262 --> 02:49:02.124]  Secure your deep cleanse at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[02:49:02.124 --> 02:49:06.466]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com is the big umbrella site.
[02:49:09.218 --> 02:49:16.182]  Supramel Vitality, I mean, if there's one product that I felt the next day, it was Supramel.
[02:49:16.182 --> 02:49:27.169]  The iodine took about 15 days, deep cleanse takes about a month, but just all together, I don't even know what works best now because I'm taking all of it.
[02:49:27.169 --> 02:49:34.174]  I would take one at a time, you know, because I've never been a big vitamin guy, but we develop these so I take my own products, I know they work, and you start taking all of it,
[02:49:35.247 --> 02:49:38.008]  When I remember to take knockout a few days a week, take me to deeper sleep.
[02:49:38.008 --> 02:49:39.088]  That's excellent.
[02:49:39.088 --> 02:49:40.989]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:49:40.989 --> 02:49:50.132]  And finally, in insane times like this, you've gotta have storable food that lasts more than 20 years, that's been recently packaged, that's super high quality and clean.
[02:49:50.132 --> 02:49:53.193]  I choose my Patriot Supply for my emergency pantry.
[02:49:53.193 --> 02:49:54.553]  It's insurance you can eat.
[02:49:54.553 --> 02:49:56.454]  We've got their full spectrum discounted.
[02:49:56.454 --> 02:49:59.235]  They also private label it as Infowars Select.
[02:49:59.235 --> 02:50:01.436]  Infowarsselect.com or Infowarsstore.com.
[02:50:02.276 --> 02:50:11.482]  It's the exact same stuff packaged at the same time, but contractually we can do a little bit bigger discounts on already the really low prices with InfoWarsSelect.com.
[02:50:11.482 --> 02:50:21.788]  So we carry it all, the full spectrum of MyPatriot supply, and we carry the full spectrum of InfoWars Select.
[02:50:21.788 --> 02:50:26.891]  It's the same stuff, just a little bit less, InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:50:26.891 --> 02:50:30.654]  And finally, I just want to see if this will happen, because we only sell like 10 of these a day.
[02:50:31.334 --> 02:50:33.135]  It's such a great way to wake people up.
[02:50:33.135 --> 02:50:36.057]  We've come out with this sheepdog design chasing a wolf.
[02:50:36.057 --> 02:50:37.318]  Made in America.
[02:50:37.318 --> 02:50:37.839]  It's $8.95.
[02:50:37.839 --> 02:50:42.882]  And we've got just the basic InfoWars coffee cups as well.
[02:50:42.882 --> 02:50:43.763]  Check those out.
[02:50:43.763 --> 02:50:46.064]  Great gift to give this Christmas.
[02:50:46.064 --> 02:50:48.526]  And your friends and family, believe me, will start visiting the website.
[02:50:48.846 --> 02:50:53.592]  When they've got a coffee cup like this that they're drinking coffee out of every day or every week.
[02:50:53.592 --> 02:50:57.956]  Or just have one for yourself, give it to your boss, your employees, and it supports the transmission.

[02:54:05.797 --> 02:54:13.862]  Obamacare is designed to destroy healthcare and then have a handful of mega insurance companies take over and have single payer.
[02:54:13.862 --> 02:54:15.162]  There's a step closer to that.
[02:54:15.162 --> 02:54:16.923]  This is out of USA Today.
[02:54:16.923 --> 02:54:21.586]  UnitedHealth warns it may exit Obamacare plans.
[02:54:21.586 --> 02:54:25.808]  Insurance giant UnitedHealth Group dealt a blow to the Affordable Care Act Thursday.
[02:54:25.808 --> 02:54:29.470]  So again, the insurance companies went on Fox, CNN.
[02:54:29.470 --> 02:54:30.191]  They admitted
[02:54:31.574 --> 02:54:32.655]  All of this years ago.
[02:54:32.655 --> 02:54:37.318]  Look, their constituents are just such moron idiots.
[02:54:37.318 --> 02:54:39.239]  They have no idea what's about to happen.
[02:54:39.239 --> 02:54:46.704]  And no matter what system it is, it's going to be a screw job because it's written by these companies that control the government and have created a fake free market.
[02:54:46.704 --> 02:54:50.767]  A real free market, you'd get the lowest price, highest quality, would win.
[02:54:50.767 --> 02:54:52.868]  Now, you got to buy it from them?
[02:54:52.868 --> 02:54:53.469]  You're screwed.
[02:54:53.469 --> 02:54:55.270]  I mean, that's a no-brainer.
[02:54:55.270 --> 02:54:58.172]  If you had to eat at one restaurant, would their food be gourmet?
[02:54:58.993 --> 02:55:02.855]  No, the price would be incredibly high and it'd be crap.
[02:55:02.855 --> 02:55:07.657]  And that's not rocket science, people.
[02:55:07.657 --> 02:55:10.958]  It's not rocket science.
[02:55:10.958 --> 02:55:12.859]  Who dominates the frozen pizza market?
[02:55:12.859 --> 02:55:16.201]  Well, whoever's got the lowest price with the highest quality taste.
[02:55:16.201 --> 02:55:21.663]  It's real simple stuff like that.
[02:55:21.663 --> 02:55:24.564]  I just can't believe it.
[02:55:24.564 --> 02:55:26.825]  Dante in Colorado, you're on the air.
[02:55:26.825 --> 02:55:27.426]  Thanks for holding.
[02:55:27.426 --> 02:55:27.726]  Go ahead.
[02:55:29.687 --> 02:55:35.672]  Hey, I'm just calling because Obama is obviously, you know, abusing his power.
[02:55:35.672 --> 02:55:39.755]  And originally, I'm from New Orleans, and I just want to take a minute.
[02:55:39.755 --> 02:55:41.396]  And I appreciate everything you're doing.
[02:55:42.984 --> 02:55:44.285]  So many of your products.
[02:55:44.285 --> 02:55:46.366]  I don't want to do a plug here.
[02:55:46.366 --> 02:55:58.311]  Well listen, I'm going to come back to you because I noticed we had a call from Sweden that I hadn't got to yet, and I want you to be able to come back and talk, but I want to go to Sweden first because I promised to go to that caller first and I forgot.
[02:55:58.311 --> 02:55:58.932]  So I apologize.
[02:55:58.932 --> 02:56:00.432]  I'll come back to you, Dante, in a minute.
[02:56:00.432 --> 02:56:01.353]  Nicholas in Sweden.
[02:56:01.353 --> 02:56:02.954]  Sorry I had forgotten you were there.
[02:56:02.954 --> 02:56:04.734]  Go ahead.
[02:56:04.734 --> 02:56:05.815]  Oh, it's okay, Alex.
[02:56:05.815 --> 02:56:11.698]  Greetings from the PC capital of the world, the originator of the Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:56:11.698 --> 02:56:12.078]  That's right.
[02:56:13.332 --> 02:56:14.492]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:56:14.492 --> 02:56:18.993]  Well, the situation here in Sweden, it's like being on the front line.
[02:56:18.993 --> 02:56:26.935]  I must say, I think I know how the people in Vichy France felt like, because we're being occupied, basically.
[02:56:26.935 --> 02:56:41.259]  And it's really, really scary when you see your society crumbling in front of you and you can't do anything about it, it feels like, because everyone you speak to are having a severe cause of, you know,
[02:56:41.989 --> 02:56:46.954]  Cognitive dissonance, you know, there is resistance growing.
[02:56:46.954 --> 02:56:54.661]  But I think the danger here is that many people are putting their hopes into, you know, the political system, which is of course rigged.
[02:56:54.661 --> 02:57:01.868]  I mean, we have the Sweden Democrats, for instance, that have, you know, in the latest polls, they're the biggest party now in Sweden.
[02:57:01.868 --> 02:57:04.211]  So there is a resistance mounting.
[02:57:04.211 --> 02:57:05.332]  The problem is, however,
[02:57:05.959 --> 02:57:18.348]  That even if this party, you know, is good, you know, I don't trust politicians myself, but even if this party is good, all the other parties combined, they've already shut them out.
[02:57:18.348 --> 02:57:21.710]  Sure, describe what it's like to live in Sweden.
[02:57:21.710 --> 02:57:32.678]  I mean, I've read reports where they won't even report the number of women raped because it's politically incorrect, they won't arrest people for rape, and reportedly the Muslims have gotten so radical they just run around bullying everybody and are like gods.
[02:57:33.976 --> 02:57:35.857]  Yeah, let's just say this.
[02:57:35.857 --> 02:57:51.627]  We had one case now, not very long ago, in a Swedish town where there's these refugee centers that they set up for, you know, the orphan children or whatever, you know, lonely immigrants that come without their parents, so to speak.
[02:57:51.627 --> 02:57:58.452]  Here in Sweden, we call them skogbarn, which is bearded children, because everyone knows that they're not children.
[02:57:58.952 --> 02:58:05.862]  They're grown men, but they're basically, you know, put out there that they are, you know, children.
[02:58:05.862 --> 02:58:13.592]  And there was this woman that went outside one of these, you know, homes for these so-called children.
[02:58:13.592 --> 02:58:14.714]  She was brutally raped.
[02:58:15.274 --> 02:58:23.780]  And then, when she was raped one time, she managed to, you know, get up and walked away and tried to, you know, get out, basically.
[02:58:23.780 --> 02:58:29.084]  Then, there were other men from another, you know, of these homes that raped her again.
[02:58:29.084 --> 02:58:35.368]  Sure, I saw that in the news, and then the police wouldn't, didn't even arrest one of them, if I remember correctly.
[02:58:35.368 --> 02:58:36.489]  It's just over the top.
[02:58:36.489 --> 02:58:38.590]  You should tell your testimony online on YouTube.
[02:58:38.590 --> 02:58:40.231]  You should write an article about it.
[02:58:40.231 --> 02:58:42.233]  Just, this is the murder of the West.
[02:58:42.873 --> 02:58:43.737]  By design.
[02:58:43.737 --> 02:58:46.306]  And there's plenty of nice Muslims we could bring in, but they don't.
[02:58:46.306 --> 02:58:47.209]  They bring in the radicals.
[02:58:47.209 --> 02:58:48.354]  We're gonna come back with more calls.
[02:58:49.286 --> 02:58:52.769]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:58:52.769 --> 02:59:01.016]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:59:01.016 --> 02:59:06.440]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:59:06.440 --> 02:59:08.963]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:59:08.963 --> 02:59:11.084]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[02:59:11.084 --> 02:59:15.268]  Secure your DNA force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:59:19.139 --> 02:59:20.239]  BrainForce is here.
[02:59:20.239 --> 02:59:22.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:59:22.440 --> 02:59:27.442]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:59:27.442 --> 02:59:30.723]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:59:30.723 --> 02:59:34.224]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:59:34.224 --> 02:59:36.185]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:59:36.185 --> 02:59:38.305]  It doesn't have stimulus, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:59:38.305 --> 02:59:40.306]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[02:59:40.306 --> 02:59:45.908]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:51.866 --> 03:00:01.949]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.949 --> 03:00:08.570]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:08.570 --> 03:00:11.551]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.351 --> 03:00:20.792]  We are back live, broadcasting worldwide.
[03:00:20.792 --> 03:00:23.313]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.313 --> 03:00:24.513]  Final segment I'm hosting.
[03:00:24.513 --> 03:00:25.614]  We'll continue with your calls.
[03:00:25.614 --> 03:00:32.836]  Anthony Gucciardi's coming up to cover the latest in the economy, what's happening overseas, the open borders, and more.
[03:00:32.836 --> 03:00:34.477]  We were just talking to a caller from Sweden.
[03:00:34.477 --> 03:00:35.817]  Dante, sorry to cut you off.
[03:00:35.817 --> 03:00:38.838]  I had just promised to go to that caller first, if he was able to hold.
[03:00:38.838 --> 03:00:40.039]  Go ahead from Colorado.
[03:00:41.880 --> 03:00:43.321]  Alright, thank you.
[03:00:43.321 --> 03:00:52.188]  I just wanted to say, you know, Obama is obviously abusing his power, and we have to realize that, you know, in 1776, it was us.
[03:00:52.188 --> 03:00:56.752]  We the people that really, at the end of the day, that's where the buck stops.
[03:00:56.752 --> 03:01:00.535]  And the sooner we realize that, the better off this country will be.
[03:01:00.535 --> 03:01:10.022]  And it's just sad to see America just kind of going down the tooth like this, and I just wanted people, American citizens, even people worldwide, to know that.
[03:01:11.066 --> 03:01:21.970]  It's the people that have the power, not the governments that are abusing their powers and it's given to them or like puppets, if you know what I mean.
[03:01:21.970 --> 03:01:25.172]  Well, I agree with you, and the elites have just gotten away with so much.
[03:01:25.172 --> 03:01:26.192]  They think they're invincible.
[03:01:26.192 --> 03:01:27.532]  They're not.
[03:01:27.532 --> 03:01:31.114]  We are engaged in 1776, though, an info war.
[03:01:31.114 --> 03:01:38.797]  We're winning on many fronts, the hearts and minds, whether it's on abortion, whether it's on open borders, whether it's on gun control, whether it's globalism.
[03:01:39.997 --> 03:01:42.817]  We have to defend ourselves if it gets physical.
[03:01:42.817 --> 03:01:45.778]  And we are having a revolution of people buying guns, learning how to use them.
[03:01:45.778 --> 03:01:47.578]  That's in the news as well.
[03:01:47.578 --> 03:01:48.919]  That's confirmed.
[03:01:48.919 --> 03:01:58.220]  But offensively going after criminal elements of the government is not the way to go, because they're set up to respond to that, to demonize that, to spin that.
[03:01:58.220 --> 03:02:00.020]  That's why they want to get things violent.
[03:02:00.020 --> 03:02:01.801]  And I know you're not calling for that.
[03:02:01.801 --> 03:02:04.421]  I'm just pointing out that that is the last thing we want.
[03:02:04.421 --> 03:02:05.501]  I appreciate your call.
[03:02:05.501 --> 03:02:09.142]  The last thing we want is any violence against Obama.
[03:02:10.117 --> 03:02:13.059]  Because that would turn him into a martyr.
[03:02:13.059 --> 03:02:14.720]  That would turn him into a celebrity.
[03:02:14.720 --> 03:02:16.762]  That would turn him into a victim.
[03:02:16.762 --> 03:02:18.823]  And we don't want that.
[03:02:18.823 --> 03:02:21.725]  We want to destroy the ideas he's pushed.
[03:02:21.725 --> 03:02:23.647]  We want to destroy his fraud.
[03:02:23.647 --> 03:02:29.451]  We want to keep him alive, to destroy him in name, and his politics, and what he represents.
[03:02:29.451 --> 03:02:33.194]  We want to keep him alive, to destroy him completely.
[03:02:33.194 --> 03:02:35.235]  Politically.
[03:02:35.235 --> 03:02:37.317]  Dion in Illinois, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:02:40.117 --> 03:02:41.978]  Yeah, Alex, how are you doing?
[03:02:41.978 --> 03:02:44.379]  Good, brother, go ahead.
[03:02:44.379 --> 03:02:51.523]  Yeah, I think Obama's bringing in the refugees maybe to set up a false flag where they shoot up schools.
[03:02:51.523 --> 03:02:52.183]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[03:02:52.183 --> 03:02:53.984]  And then he'll say, turn our guns in.
[03:02:53.984 --> 03:02:55.545]  The Democrats are already saying that, yeah?
[03:02:55.545 --> 03:02:58.446]  Because they've suspended logic.
[03:02:58.446 --> 03:03:05.710]  Do you think we're one false flag away from suspension of firearms and that the refugees would be the perfect pasty for that?
[03:03:07.799 --> 03:03:13.721]  Yes, and I think they're not above attacking a school full of refugees, too, and blaming it on the left-wing or right-wing or anything.
[03:03:13.721 --> 03:03:16.982]  I mean, there's just no telling what these crazies will do.
[03:03:16.982 --> 03:03:18.622]  Let me tell you, they're too confident.
[03:03:18.622 --> 03:03:24.764]  Like, Corsi thinks they're on the rocks, and I think he's partially right, but I'm telling you, they're too arrogant.
[03:03:24.764 --> 03:03:26.165]  They're too confident.
[03:03:26.165 --> 03:03:34.327]  They're either completely insane, or they got multiple ace cards up their sleeves.
[03:03:34.327 --> 03:03:37.228]  Have you seen a movie that's done for Washington this age?
[03:03:39.346 --> 03:03:40.967]  Have I seen the movie The Siege?
[03:03:40.967 --> 03:03:41.807]  I think I have.
[03:03:41.807 --> 03:03:43.888]  Refresh my memory?
[03:03:43.888 --> 03:03:50.670]  Yeah, they kidnap the terrorists and abduct them, and then there's a series of terrorist attacks in the city.
[03:03:50.670 --> 03:03:53.231]  Oh yeah, that's in New York, in Marshall Long, it's declared.
[03:03:53.231 --> 03:03:54.651]  Yes, yes.
[03:03:54.651 --> 03:03:58.032]  Of course, it's got Bruce Willis in it.
[03:03:58.032 --> 03:03:59.173]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:59.173 --> 03:04:00.353]  He plays the commanding general.
[03:04:00.353 --> 03:04:02.614]  Alright, I'm out of time.
[03:04:02.614 --> 03:04:05.175]  But Brandon, Tim,
[03:04:06.837 --> 03:04:13.362]  Tabitha, Nicholas, all of you, you'll be able to talk to Anthony Gucciardi coming up on the situations we've been witnessing.
[03:04:13.362 --> 03:04:13.422]  800-259-9231.
[03:04:13.422 --> 03:04:13.502]  800-259-9231.
[03:04:13.502 --> 03:04:15.764]  It is all coming up with Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:04:15.764 --> 03:04:15.904]  Fresh
[03:04:24.651 --> 03:04:30.455]  Horse out there with the Pony Express to bring you the info straight ahead.
[03:04:30.455 --> 03:04:44.904]  This horse is going to move on now, not to a break, but to working here, getting ready for the InfoWars Nightly News, talking to our reporters overseas, and working on getting the TV slash radio show syndicated on more TV stations.
[03:04:44.904 --> 03:04:50.847]  We are getting some affiliates across the country, but I've yet to launch a big rollout of that because I've been so busy with other stuff, but we are on the satellite now.
[03:04:50.847 --> 03:04:53.069]  So I want to thank you all for your support as well.
[03:04:53.909 --> 03:04:59.332]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com if you'd like to financially support us.
[03:04:59.332 --> 03:05:06.635]  In the second Democrat debate this last weekend, it was a last-minute change the day before to talk about foreign policy because of the terrorist attacks.
[03:05:06.635 --> 03:05:09.136]  The Sanders campaign was furious.
[03:05:09.136 --> 03:05:12.018]  Bernie wasn't ready to talk about terrorism.
[03:05:12.018 --> 03:05:16.260]  The moderator asked him if he still thought the greatest threat to national security was climate change.
[03:05:16.620 --> 03:05:17.360]  Absolutely.
[03:05:17.360 --> 03:05:20.702]  In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.
[03:05:20.702 --> 03:05:22.322]  Do you understand what Sanders is saying?
[03:05:22.322 --> 03:05:25.744]  Climate change is directly related to terrorism.
[03:05:25.744 --> 03:05:28.985]  Terrorism has nothing to do with wars for oil and power.
[03:05:28.985 --> 03:05:30.626]  It's not about a clash of cultures.
[03:05:30.626 --> 03:05:34.487]  And as every liberal will tell you, it has nothing to do with Islam.
[03:05:34.487 --> 03:05:36.148]  So it must be climate change.
[03:05:36.508 --> 03:05:37.289]  Bernie!
[03:05:37.289 --> 03:05:41.551]  Al-Qaeda and ISIS were not created to fight climate change!
[03:05:41.551 --> 03:05:43.012]  But there is an indirect link.
[03:05:43.012 --> 03:05:45.974]  Bernie Sanders won't tell you, however, if he even sees it.
[03:05:45.974 --> 03:05:56.301]  Al-Qaeda and ISIS are a creation of the same governments and multinational corporations that are trying to create a global government using terrorism and climate change as an excuse.
[03:05:56.301 --> 03:05:58.022]  BrentForWars.com, I'm David Knight.

[03:08:00.854 --> 03:08:06.259]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:06.259 --> 03:08:08.542]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:16.559 --> 03:08:20.962]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, the Overdrive Edition.
[03:08:20.962 --> 03:08:22.022]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:08:22.022 --> 03:08:32.628]  I'll be your guest for the remainder of the hour, covering the newest news, some of the news you definitely didn't hear about on the show today, that I've dug up from around the internet.
[03:08:32.628 --> 03:08:42.574]  And also we have a special guest joining us at the bottom of the hour that's going to talk about some really, really interesting new ways, the so-called secrets of cleansing your body.
[03:08:43.134 --> 03:08:47.599]  from the toxic substances that we're experiencing on a daily basis.
[03:08:47.599 --> 03:08:56.108]  And speaking of toxic substances, let's go through some of the news headlines, including genetically modified salmon cleared for human consumption.
[03:08:56.108 --> 03:09:03.056]  If you've been following this for a while, you know that the, I believe it's called Aqua Fresh, genetically modified salmon, Aqua Bounty,
[03:09:03.877 --> 03:09:05.919]  That the FDA went back and forth for a while.
[03:09:05.919 --> 03:09:10.744]  Congress actually blocked it and said that the approval may be unsafe and there's more testing required.
[03:09:10.744 --> 03:09:12.246]  And then the FDA said, well, we don't care.
[03:09:12.246 --> 03:09:14.688]  We're going to push it through, whatever.
[03:09:14.688 --> 03:09:17.151]  And this is out of Reuters today.
[03:09:17.151 --> 03:09:26.840]  Federal regulators cleared the way for a genetically engineered salmon to be farmed for human consumption in the first ever such approval for an animal whose DNA has been scientifically modified.
[03:09:27.461 --> 03:09:33.566]  Now we're getting into modified DNA of animals, even more complex than plants.
[03:09:33.566 --> 03:09:33.946]  The U.S.
[03:09:33.946 --> 03:09:42.713]  Food and Drug Administration's approval of the salmon, developed by AquaBounty Technologies to grow faster than conventional farmed salmon, follows years of deliberations.
[03:09:42.713 --> 03:09:50.119]  The regulator has declared the salmon is as nutritious as normally grown Atlantic salmon, which means the salmon will not require specific labeling.
[03:09:50.119 --> 03:09:51.260]  That's the key point.
[03:09:51.260 --> 03:09:54.282]  They're not actually going to even label the GMO salmon.
[03:09:55.163 --> 03:09:58.345]  Because it's the same thing, guys.
[03:09:58.345 --> 03:10:01.948]  Regardless of whether or not it's even safe.
[03:10:01.948 --> 03:10:02.208]  Right?
[03:10:02.208 --> 03:10:03.509]  Regardless.
[03:10:03.509 --> 03:10:11.334]  We should still have the decision to choose to eat genetically modified animals when we're at the grocery store.
[03:10:11.334 --> 03:10:16.217]  But the FDA says that would be bad because it's nutritionally the same, even though it's modified.
[03:10:16.217 --> 03:10:17.458]  You're not allowed to know what you're doing.
[03:10:18.288 --> 03:10:24.591]  In other news, Putin puts a $50 million bounty on heads of metro jet bombers.
[03:10:24.591 --> 03:10:36.097]  And, if you're not aware of this news already, Vladimir Putin has offered a $50 million bounty for anyone who can find those responsible for blowing up a Russian plane over Egypt, saying, we will find them anywhere on the planet and punish them.
[03:10:37.449 --> 03:10:39.572]  It's a hardcore statement from Putin.
[03:10:39.572 --> 03:10:55.292]  And it's interesting, and I want to play some of these videos for you, because as other countries are issuing these hardcore statements against ISIS and terrorism of all forms, and saying we're going to do anything possible, $50 million bounties, just going all out.
[03:10:56.428 --> 03:10:58.850]  What's happening here in the United States?
[03:10:58.850 --> 03:11:00.592]  What's happening in France?
[03:11:00.592 --> 03:11:10.860]  We're accepting more refugees, and people like Sheryl Atkinson say that Obama won't even read the reports on terrorist groups to begin with.
[03:11:10.860 --> 03:11:12.402]  Let's queue up that video.
[03:11:12.402 --> 03:11:18.026]  I have talked to people who work in the Obama administration who firmly believe he's made up his mind.
[03:11:18.026 --> 03:11:20.789]  I would say closed his mind, they say.
[03:11:21.371 --> 03:11:31.039]  To their intelligence that they've tried to bring him about various groups, that he does not consider terrorists, even if they're on the US list of designated terrorists.
[03:11:31.039 --> 03:11:36.484]  He has his own ideas, and there are those who have known him a long time who say this dates back to law school.
[03:11:36.484 --> 03:11:40.848]  If he did not necessarily, you may think this is a good trait, you may think it's a bad trait.
[03:11:40.848 --> 03:11:44.851]  He does not necessarily listen to the people with whom he disagrees.
[03:11:44.851 --> 03:11:45.972]  He seems to dig in.
[03:11:46.684 --> 03:11:51.208]  And that would be, I suppose he would say, because he thinks he's right.
[03:11:51.208 --> 03:11:54.411]  He is facing formidable opposition on this particular point.
[03:11:54.411 --> 03:12:08.563]  So when he stands there and says, as he always does, no matter what the issue, you may notice this, I'm sure as a reporter you notice this, like I do, no matter what the issue, no matter what the topic, no matter what the press conference, if it's a controversial thing or he's getting pushback on it from anywhere, he'll say,
[03:12:09.223 --> 03:12:10.944]  I'm not the only one who believes this.
[03:12:10.944 --> 03:12:12.225]  Everybody believes it.
[03:12:12.225 --> 03:12:13.606]  That's a weakness, I think.
[03:12:13.606 --> 03:12:30.277]  But you're telling me that you've talked to people in his inner circle or in the administration that are telling you that even though there are groups that might be on our terror list, that are classified as terrorist groups, Obama, in his mind, doesn't consider them to be terrorists.
[03:12:30.277 --> 03:12:30.797]  Because what?
[03:12:30.797 --> 03:12:33.439]  Because they have a gripe?
[03:12:33.439 --> 03:12:34.920]  I don't know the reasoning for it.
[03:12:34.920 --> 03:12:36.441]  I've only been told by those who have
[03:12:37.091 --> 03:12:42.475]  So he won't even read the intelligence reports, according to Sheryl Atkinson, about the ISIS terrorists, about terrorist groups in the United States.
[03:12:42.475 --> 03:12:44.377]  Just letting everyone in.
[03:12:44.377 --> 03:12:47.019]  And here's the thing, by the way, this isn't even a political issue.
[03:13:02.512 --> 03:13:03.733]  I'm over politics.
[03:13:03.733 --> 03:13:05.694]  I'm on the third party of reality.
[03:13:05.694 --> 03:13:08.615]  I'm on the third party of humanity.
[03:13:08.615 --> 03:13:11.277]  I'm on the third party of reason.
[03:13:11.277 --> 03:13:12.617]  This is above politics.
[03:13:12.617 --> 03:13:14.378]  This is beyond politics.
[03:13:14.378 --> 03:13:17.100]  This is the most fundamental basics.
[03:13:17.100 --> 03:13:29.847]  And one of the main reasons this country is so sick, and this planet is so sick, and our ideologies have been decayed and destroyed in many ways, is because we don't seem to understand the details.
[03:13:31.141 --> 03:13:42.267]  We have to lump everything, because we've been told to by the establishment system from the schools we've been put into to the re-education camp-style learning systems, that everything has to be black or white.
[03:13:42.267 --> 03:13:43.728]  A or B. Right?
[03:13:43.728 --> 03:13:51.572]  You know the basic analogy of left versus right, the Democrats versus Republicans, that everyone uses to attack the other.
[03:13:51.572 --> 03:13:57.195]  What it is, it's a self-defense mechanism that we've created, that we've utilized,
[03:13:57.935 --> 03:13:58.456]  We're good to go.
[03:14:15.629 --> 03:14:26.255]  And just letting all this happen, and I have another video I'm going to play here in a second about how he was warned about the Syrian refugees before the ISIS attacks, and he didn't care.
[03:14:26.255 --> 03:14:27.876]  That's not politics.
[03:14:27.876 --> 03:14:37.762]  But some people listening right now are going to say, well Anthony Gucciardi sounds like he's a right-winger because he criticized Obama, or they're going to say something even sillier.
[03:14:38.729 --> 03:14:44.034]  Alright, they're going to say that shirt he's wearing looks bad, therefore I don't trust him.
[03:14:44.034 --> 03:14:47.458]  Or, you know, he sounds like an idiot.
[03:14:47.458 --> 03:14:51.542]  The way I speak makes your brain shut off.
[03:14:51.542 --> 03:14:59.550]  All these people do, in many ways, is they label things to shut it down, or they use personal attacks.
[03:14:59.550 --> 03:15:01.311]  Alright, so let's say, for example,
[03:15:02.253 --> 03:15:06.375]  I like fishing, which I'm actually not a huge fan of fishing, but I like to go out fishing.
[03:15:06.375 --> 03:15:09.757]  But you don't like fishing, so therefore, everything I say is bad.
[03:15:09.757 --> 03:15:14.179]  Or I made a mistake one time on air and I said something that you didn't agree with.
[03:15:14.179 --> 03:15:15.840]  Or I used a word, right?
[03:15:15.840 --> 03:15:18.581]  I used a word that you didn't agree with.
[03:15:18.581 --> 03:15:20.242]  Well, everything he said is now wrong.
[03:15:21.007 --> 03:15:23.028]  And that's how we've been taught to think.
[03:15:23.028 --> 03:15:26.891]  We've just been taught to think that ideas reflect on the person.
[03:15:26.891 --> 03:15:34.916]  And if we don't agree with something about that person, or agree about something that person does, therefore the ideas are worthless.
[03:15:34.916 --> 03:15:42.822]  But I know most of you listening to this show and watching it on whatever platform you're watching it on, know that it is about the ideas.
[03:15:42.822 --> 03:15:44.783]  And that's why we're making a difference.
[03:15:44.783 --> 03:15:50.427]  And that's why we can talk about real things and real issues instead of the mainstream media, which is like a circus.
[03:15:51.487 --> 03:15:53.929]  And all they use is labels.
[03:15:53.929 --> 03:15:59.732]  They say conservative journalist, liberal journalist, libertarian journalist.
[03:15:59.732 --> 03:16:01.993]  How about journalist?
[03:16:01.993 --> 03:16:07.196]  Why do we have to coincide with a specific party or a specific idea?
[03:16:07.196 --> 03:16:12.900]  Black Lives Matter versus All Lives Matter versus not even having to say that?
[03:16:14.369 --> 03:16:15.931]  It all goes back to the fundamentals.
[03:16:15.931 --> 03:16:17.633]  It's a self-defense mechanism.
[03:16:17.633 --> 03:16:24.981]  And speaking of that, let's go to this video where it actually says, Obama officials before Paris attack warned of risk of Syrian refugees in the U.S.
[03:16:24.981 --> 03:16:26.463]  And this is not a political thing.
[03:16:26.463 --> 03:16:28.065]  This is third party of reality.
[03:16:28.065 --> 03:16:29.466]  This is third party of reason.
[03:16:29.466 --> 03:16:33.311]  We should probably care about Syrian refugee intel on terrorist attacks.
[03:16:33.311 --> 03:16:34.072]  Let's check out this video.
[03:16:34.472 --> 03:16:49.807]  It is a time-consuming process and one of the challenges we will have is that we're not going to know a whole lot about the individual refugees that come forward from the UN High Commission on Refugees for resettlement and vetting.
[03:16:49.807 --> 03:16:56.473]  We don't obviously put it past the likes of ISIL to infiltrate operatives.
[03:16:57.316 --> 03:17:01.757]  You're correct that we did discover in people who had come in as refugees from Iraq
[03:17:25.022 --> 03:17:33.069]  A number of people who are of serious concern, including two that were charged when we found their fingerprints on improvised explosive devices from Iraq.
[03:17:33.069 --> 03:17:39.555]  There's no doubt that that was the product of a less than excellent vetting that had been done on Iraqi refugees.
[03:17:39.555 --> 03:17:40.936]  It is not a perfect process.
[03:17:40.936 --> 03:17:45.580]  There is a degree of risk attached to any screening and vetting process.
[03:17:45.580 --> 03:17:48.423]  We look to manage that risk as best we can.
[03:17:48.423 --> 03:17:50.644]  The bad news is our ability
[03:17:51.746 --> 03:17:56.111]  To touch data with respect to people who may come from Syria may be limited.
[03:17:56.111 --> 03:17:58.774]  That is, if we don't know much about somebody, there won't be anything in our data.
[03:17:58.774 --> 03:18:00.996]  We don't have the information of most of these people.
[03:18:00.996 --> 03:18:02.238]  Isn't that true?
[03:18:02.238 --> 03:18:07.804]  Yeah, and so I can't sit here and offer anybody an absolute assurance that there's no risk associated with this.
[03:18:07.804 --> 03:18:10.908]  The bad news is there's no risk-free process.
[03:18:11.561 --> 03:18:20.054]  Well, the bad news is we should probably just ignore all the risks about the terrorist groups that we're letting inside the United States.
[03:18:20.054 --> 03:18:21.757]  And again, it's not a left-versus-right issue.
[03:18:21.757 --> 03:18:23.199]  It's a third-party of reality thing.
[03:18:24.011 --> 03:18:29.978]  Maybe we shouldn't ignore all the warnings from people that actually know what they're talking about.
[03:18:29.978 --> 03:18:30.939]  But you know what?
[03:18:30.939 --> 03:18:37.726]  I saw an R next to someone's name indicating Republican on that mashup by the Washington Free Beacon.
[03:18:37.726 --> 03:18:40.990]  And thanks to the Washington Free Beacon for allowing us to use that.
[03:18:40.990 --> 03:18:43.232]  But I saw an R next to one of their names.
[03:18:44.093 --> 03:18:56.451]  I'm going to use labels and preconceived notions and the mainstream media slash establishment system that I've been brought up on to attack that person and therefore disregard everything they just said.
[03:18:56.451 --> 03:18:59.675]  In fact, you notice someone that is hardcore left or right.
[03:19:00.441 --> 03:19:05.744]  I mean, they could literally have cancer and their doctor could be the opposite spectrum.
[03:19:05.744 --> 03:19:09.426]  Let's say they're extreme liberal and they go to the doctor and the doctor's a Republican.
[03:19:09.426 --> 03:19:11.608]  He says, I've run all the tests, you have cancer.
[03:19:11.608 --> 03:19:12.428]  You're a liar!
[03:19:12.428 --> 03:19:13.669]  You don't know anything!
[03:19:13.669 --> 03:19:15.530]  You're a Republican!
[03:19:15.530 --> 03:19:19.272]  It is so silly that we can't listen to humans anymore because of their ideas.
[03:19:19.272 --> 03:19:25.416]  We have to label them, to shut them down as a self-defense mechanism against free-thinking ideology.
[03:19:25.416 --> 03:19:28.578]  Because I can't talk about this stuff where I'm an Obama basher.
[03:19:29.617 --> 03:19:31.379]  Or I'm criticizing.
[03:19:31.379 --> 03:19:33.142]  Or I'm supporting the Republicans.
[03:19:33.142 --> 03:19:33.622]  Nope.
[03:19:33.622 --> 03:19:34.644]  That's not how it is.
[03:19:34.644 --> 03:19:35.765]  This is reality.
[03:19:35.765 --> 03:19:38.989]  This is Anthony Gucciardi on the Overdrive edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:38.989 --> 03:19:46.179]  We'll be back with a lot more and a special guest coming up, Alex Jones, at the end of the program, joining us to talk about another special message as well.
[03:20:02.045 --> 03:20:06.686]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[03:20:06.686 --> 03:20:10.967]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[03:20:10.967 --> 03:20:12.347]  We typically do the same thing.
[03:20:12.347 --> 03:20:15.367]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[03:20:15.367 --> 03:20:17.588]  But have you considered heat storage?
[03:20:17.588 --> 03:20:19.788]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[03:20:19.788 --> 03:20:22.088]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[03:20:22.088 --> 03:20:23.729]  How will I keep my family warm?
[03:20:23.729 --> 03:20:26.209]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[03:20:26.209 --> 03:20:30.270]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[03:20:31.098 --> 03:20:32.219]  Another concern?
[03:20:32.219 --> 03:20:36.200]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[03:20:36.200 --> 03:20:38.781]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[03:20:38.781 --> 03:20:42.763]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[03:20:42.763 --> 03:20:45.565]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[03:20:45.565 --> 03:20:50.207]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[03:20:50.207 --> 03:20:52.208]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[03:20:52.208 --> 03:20:53.848]  FortressClothing.com.
[03:20:53.848 --> 03:20:55.209]  You'll never be cold again.
[03:20:59.082 --> 03:21:00.023]  Alex Jones here.

[03:21:59.158 --> 03:22:10.043]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:22:10.043 --> 03:22:14.205]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[03:22:14.205 --> 03:22:16.366]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:22:16.366 --> 03:22:21.828]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:22:22.008 --> 03:22:32.012]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:22:32.012 --> 03:22:38.515]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:22:38.515 --> 03:22:41.837]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[03:22:41.837 --> 03:22:43.918]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[03:22:43.918 --> 03:22:47.039]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:22:47.059 --> 03:22:49.520]  Heart and body extract gets results.

[03:22:58.763 --> 03:23:00.764]  Your house is under attack.
[03:23:00.764 --> 03:23:06.786]  Every day our homes and families are attacked by harmful gases, mold, and pollutants caused by everyday activities.
[03:23:07.146 --> 03:23:12.711]  According to the EPA, indoor air can be 5 to 100 times worse than outdoor air.
[03:23:12.711 --> 03:23:19.456]  And the American Lung Association states that poor indoor air can cause infections and chronic lung diseases such as asthma.
[03:23:19.456 --> 03:23:23.580]  Protect your family with a complete indoor air quality package from Wave Home Solutions.
[03:23:23.800 --> 03:23:31.885]  Wave ventilation units for basements and crawl spaces reduce moisture that nourishes mold, odors, dust mites, and expels gases and pollutants.

[03:24:08.110 --> 03:24:09.511]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:09.511 --> 03:24:10.612]  I'm Anthony Guciardi.
[03:24:10.612 --> 03:24:13.555]  This is the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:24:13.555 --> 03:24:27.485]  And coming up next segment, we've got a very special guest who's going to break down the secrets of total body cleansing and some really, really free things you can do at your house that I totally agree with and I think are really powerful to feel better.
[03:24:28.306 --> 03:24:29.767]  In a very short period of time.
[03:24:29.767 --> 03:24:39.531]  But first I want to get to some news and articles and then later at the end of the show, the last segment, Alex will be joining us with some feedback on some health stories as well.
[03:24:39.531 --> 03:24:48.615]  But remember that company run by the CEO who decided to do this that raised the price of an AIDS-related
[03:24:49.679 --> 03:24:59.466]  Age-related, it should say on all these titles, by the way, because it's really a food poisoning type drug that's specifically used in a lot of HIV-slash-AIDS patient cases.
[03:24:59.466 --> 03:25:00.967]  But it's an age-related drug.
[03:25:00.967 --> 03:25:05.871]  He jacked up the price by 5,500 percent.
[03:25:05.871 --> 03:25:06.652]  Okay?
[03:25:06.652 --> 03:25:07.872]  It went from like $20.
[03:25:07.872 --> 03:25:11.175]  It's an article, I remember reading it months ago.
[03:25:11.175 --> 03:25:12.035]  Yes, it was...
[03:25:13.612 --> 03:25:24.940]  It costs a dollar per tablet to make, and he raised the price from $13.50, which is an amazing profit margin, to $750 a pill.
[03:25:24.940 --> 03:25:29.904]  So it's used to treat conditions including AIDS-related toxoplasmosis, and that's what I was talking about.
[03:25:29.904 --> 03:25:33.846]  It's specifically used in a lot of cases for AIDS patients.
[03:25:33.846 --> 03:25:35.667]  But $13.50 to $750, you might remember this article, 5,500%.
[03:25:41.482 --> 03:25:50.188]  His company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, has now lost $14.6 million dollars this quarter.
[03:25:50.188 --> 03:25:52.650]  The loss was made between July and the end of September.
[03:25:52.650 --> 03:25:59.555]  The next revenue reported in Turing's financial report for Daraprim and blood pressure drug was $5.6 million.
[03:25:59.555 --> 03:26:04.138]  He defended the losses, saying it had been investing money into new drugs.
[03:26:04.138 --> 03:26:07.360]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[03:26:07.360 --> 03:26:09.622]  It's good to make money and help people.
[03:26:10.580 --> 03:26:11.580]  It really, really is.
[03:26:11.580 --> 03:26:15.422]  It's an amazing thing for good people to have money.
[03:26:15.422 --> 03:26:17.242]  And I mean good intentioned people.
[03:26:17.242 --> 03:26:18.403]  We all make mistakes, right?
[03:26:18.403 --> 03:26:19.663]  There's no one that's truly good.
[03:26:19.663 --> 03:26:21.444]  No angel out there.
[03:26:21.444 --> 03:26:25.185]  There's no Mother Teresa walking around making millions.
[03:26:25.185 --> 03:26:26.666]  But I mean people with good intentions.
[03:26:27.486 --> 03:26:34.508]  Money is not actually inherently evil, because in the Bible we talk, you know, people say, well money is the root of all evil.
[03:26:34.508 --> 03:26:39.709]  No, actually it says love of money is the root of all evil.
[03:26:39.709 --> 03:26:46.710]  And I believe love of money can help raise the HIV-related drug price by 5,500%.
[03:26:46.710 --> 03:26:47.230]  And what happens is,
[03:26:50.674 --> 03:26:52.755]  It's called churn and burn.
[03:26:52.755 --> 03:26:57.017]  You can make a ton of cash up front when you do truly wicked things for cash.
[03:26:57.017 --> 03:26:58.258]  I mean, tons of cash.
[03:26:58.258 --> 03:27:00.699]  The pharmaceutical companies do it all the time.
[03:27:00.699 --> 03:27:19.069]  I know people that were making $300,000 to $400,000, sometimes $500,000 per month, due to a pharmaceutical drug company loophole, where Blue Cross Blue Shield would pay for certain drugs, due to some weird legislation or whatever, that were upwards of $30,000 per bottle.
[03:27:19.069 --> 03:27:19.970]  Insurance would cover it.
[03:27:21.092 --> 03:27:23.675]  So doctors would be writing it up.
[03:27:23.675 --> 03:27:26.638]  And these companies were making tons and tons of cash.
[03:27:26.638 --> 03:27:29.161]  Until it got shut down.
[03:27:29.161 --> 03:27:30.322]  Churn and burn.
[03:27:30.322 --> 03:27:33.746]  The sustainable way to do it is to have good intentions.
[03:27:34.841 --> 03:27:35.881]  And again, we all make mistakes.
[03:27:35.881 --> 03:27:37.041]  No one's perfect.
[03:27:37.041 --> 03:27:39.642]  If someone says they're perfect, run the other way.
[03:27:39.642 --> 03:27:58.586]  If you're talking and coming clean about something and someone says, well, I'm perfect, I don't do anything like that, I'm a great person, I would never do something like that, turn around, say nothing, say thank you, and walk away and run away from that person, and say thank you for showing me that you are a completely phony, fake person.
[03:27:59.406 --> 03:28:07.670]  Just like the politicians that stand up there during the debates with a smile on their face and love of God and family.
[03:28:07.670 --> 03:28:20.276]  What joker clowns, what complete actors and actresses, complete morons that have no truth in their human essence and their soul and their humanity.
[03:28:20.276 --> 03:28:22.577]  They choose to be fake to dupe you.
[03:28:22.577 --> 03:28:25.598]  Being real is the only answer and it's the only way.
[03:28:25.598 --> 03:28:27.439]  Let's get into some more news before we hit the next segment.
[03:28:28.996 --> 03:28:34.381]  Superbug emerges in China to remind us that antibiotics won't last forever, which is extremely true.
[03:28:34.381 --> 03:28:44.031]  In general, according to a study in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, a gene dubbed MCR-1 is becoming more common in bacteria found in China.
[03:28:44.031 --> 03:28:47.435]  MCR-1 gives bacteria the ability to resist antibiotics called
[03:28:47.935 --> 03:28:54.141]  Polymixins, these harsh antibiotics, are considered a last line of defense, a treatment when bacteria have shown resistance to everything else.
[03:28:54.141 --> 03:28:58.384]  But with MCR-1 in tow, bacteria can thwart our most aggressive drugs.
[03:28:58.384 --> 03:29:11.236]  You know, I've told you for years and years and years, being a guest on this program and sometimes being invited to host and such, that the microbiome in your body, the gut bacteria balance in your body, is probably the most important thing.
[03:29:12.364 --> 03:29:14.005]  And no one talks about it.
[03:29:14.005 --> 03:29:19.747]  They finally started admitting that mental illness is most likely triggered by your gut.
[03:29:19.747 --> 03:29:21.327]  And all of us feel anxiety sometimes.
[03:29:21.327 --> 03:29:23.048]  That's in the gut.
[03:29:23.048 --> 03:29:31.531]  We are gonna hit an age where antibiotics are becoming useless and we're gonna finally be forced to go back to the root of health, the gut, the balance of bacteria.
[03:29:31.531 --> 03:29:34.952]  And we can talk to our guest coming up about that and a lot more.
[03:29:34.952 --> 03:29:35.792]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:29:35.792 --> 03:29:37.593]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:37.593 --> 03:29:37.993]  Stay tuned.
[03:29:37.993 --> 03:29:40.254]  We got a lot more coming and Alex joining us later in the program.
[03:29:48.775 --> 03:29:52.701]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.701 --> 03:29:55.385]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.415 --> 03:30:04.740]  It's election season, a time where we'll soon find out who will be the leader of the free world.
[03:30:04.740 --> 03:30:14.168]  Well, in what appears to be a first for a serious presidential contender, Hillary Clinton's campaign is going after the Laugh Factory comedians for making fun of her.
[03:30:14.528 --> 03:30:23.199]  A short video of this performance is posted on the website of the renowned comedy club, Laugh Factory, and the Clinton campaign has tried to censor it.
[03:30:23.199 --> 03:30:31.649]  Besides demanding that the video be taken down, Clinton demanded the personal contact information of the performers that appear in the recording.
[03:30:32.250 --> 03:30:36.073]  So what was so crass that the Clinton campaign wants it taken down?
[03:30:36.073 --> 03:30:46.480]  Well, the skits make fun of Clinton's wardrobe, her age, sexual orientation, the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and the former first lady's relationship with her famous husband.
[03:30:46.480 --> 03:30:49.402]  Basically, what we do here at InfoWars every single day.
[03:30:49.402 --> 03:30:56.446]  Now, if you want to watch this video for yourself, The Laugh Factory has appropriately titled it, Hillary vs. the First Amendment.

[03:32:55.055 --> 03:32:56.896]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:11.229 --> 03:33:11.869]  Welcome back.
[03:33:11.869 --> 03:33:13.891]  It's the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:13.891 --> 03:33:18.453]  This is Overdrive, and I'm Anthony Gucciardi with you for the rest of the hour.
[03:33:18.453 --> 03:33:26.959]  We've got Dr. Edward Group on the line, and we're going to talk about a whole lot of things, including the precedent that has been set today with the approval
[03:33:27.919 --> 03:33:42.177]  ...of genetically modified salmon for human consumption, and regardless what you think about GMOs, the safety, whatever, this is a serious precedent because it is the first time that an approval has been set for an animal with augmented DNA.
[03:33:42.177 --> 03:33:46.423]  That is, DNA that's been genetically modified, and they're not even going to label it.
[03:33:47.378 --> 03:33:50.382]  So this is a powerful precedent that's been set.
[03:33:50.382 --> 03:33:56.749]  We're also going to talk about the article I just mentioned, the super bug emerging in China that's reminding us that antibiotics won't last forever.
[03:33:56.749 --> 03:34:02.136]  We're going to talk about some awesome ways you can cleanse your body and a lot of really, really fun stuff.
[03:34:02.136 --> 03:34:02.957]  And then after this,
[03:34:03.377 --> 03:34:08.799]  Alex is going to join us for his take on the whole thing at the last segment of the hour.
[03:34:08.799 --> 03:34:16.462]  But, Dr. Group, I want to talk to you about what you think is some of the most important things going on today and your take on this whole thing.
[03:34:16.462 --> 03:34:17.322]  But go ahead and lead us off.
[03:34:18.641 --> 03:34:23.365]  Well, regarding the salmon, I mean, that's just crazy.
[03:34:23.365 --> 03:34:31.911]  We did a show not too long ago about transgenics, and whenever you have animals that are genetically modified, I mean, this has been going on.
[03:34:31.911 --> 03:34:39.617]  DARPA's been funding these black ops operations for a long time, not only with animals, but with humans.
[03:34:39.617 --> 03:34:46.803]  So this is the first step where we're actually seeing this take place in some sort of an approval process from the government.
[03:34:47.423 --> 03:34:48.368]  With the salmon.
[03:34:48.368 --> 03:34:51.122]  I think it's sick, but I think that the solution is...
[03:34:52.665 --> 03:34:53.766]  Not to buy salmon.
[03:34:53.766 --> 03:34:56.727]  I mean, you know, get the word out as much as possible.
[03:34:56.727 --> 03:35:01.570]  And coming into the holiday season, this is the worst time of the year for sickness.
[03:35:01.570 --> 03:35:14.318]  You have what we've discovered out there right now, which I'm sure you've had a lot of callers calling into, which is with chronic respiratory infections that have been lasting for four to six weeks, even more than that.
[03:35:14.318 --> 03:35:17.400]  So we definitely know that there's something going on that's in the air.
[03:35:18.260 --> 03:35:21.461]  Around the world right now, we know that Fukushima is acting up.
[03:35:21.461 --> 03:35:23.421]  There's more radiation in the water.
[03:35:23.421 --> 03:35:31.543]  The animals, off the coast of California, they're banning crabbing because of the high levels of radiation.
[03:35:31.543 --> 03:35:37.145]  We're seeing it from all different angles right now, and at the time we're coming into the holiday season.
[03:35:37.765 --> 03:35:39.226]  We're coming into Thanksgiving.
[03:35:39.226 --> 03:35:41.987]  People are going to be consuming more high fructose corn syrup.
[03:35:41.987 --> 03:35:48.549]  They're going to be consuming more processed canned foods, which are going to contain all sorts of chemicals.
[03:35:48.549 --> 03:35:59.993]  So it's a good time right now for people to really be aware of what's going on in the world and to start focusing on their own health, their family's health, make a commitment this holiday season to
[03:36:01.934 --> 03:36:10.603]  Change up and use organic products for all your Thanksgiving or all your snacks and everything else that you're going to be consuming and your family's going to be consuming.
[03:36:10.603 --> 03:36:16.889]  And not only that, but people overeat and usually gain 10 to 15 pounds from Halloween to January.
[03:36:17.930 --> 03:36:22.612]  So, it's best if they just really look at everything that you're doing.
[03:36:22.612 --> 03:36:23.593]  Drink more water.
[03:36:23.593 --> 03:36:26.294]  Try to reduce the alcohol content.
[03:36:26.294 --> 03:36:31.676]  Don't go get flu shots and vaccinations out there during this time.
[03:36:31.676 --> 03:36:34.217]  Try to reduce your stress levels.
[03:36:34.217 --> 03:36:38.299]  And just be happy during the holiday season, which is what it's intended to do.
[03:36:38.299 --> 03:36:47.303]  It's really become more of a stressful scenario over the last few years than it has a relaxation period and a healthy period for people.
[03:36:47.523 --> 03:37:02.958]  I think so too, and it's amazing because the modern society that we live in, we live in right now, this construct, it feels as if we're always walking around with 50 backpacks full of bricks on, whether it's the stress or the reality of reading this news.
[03:37:02.958 --> 03:37:04.919]  I mean, just look at some of these headlines.
[03:37:04.919 --> 03:37:07.061]  You know, GMO salmon cleared for human consumption.
[03:37:07.842 --> 03:37:26.266]  The pot-smoking Paris suicide bomber, ex-wife reveals blood brother terrorist was a jobless layabout who spent his entire time taking drugs and sleeping, never went to mosque, and then he went and blew himself up trying to kill people, superbugs emerging, ISIS threatens New York City, a new propaganda video, the U.S.
[03:37:26.266 --> 03:37:30.627]  approves $1.29 billion in arms sale to Saudi Arabia.
[03:37:30.627 --> 03:37:32.187]  The truth is life is stressful.
[03:37:32.187 --> 03:37:35.888]  The truth is that a lot of people, including me, including everyone,
[03:37:36.488 --> 03:37:42.032]  have short attention spans and we forget when the holiday season comes about the high fructose corn syrup.
[03:37:42.032 --> 03:37:43.273]  We forget to drink the water.
[03:37:43.273 --> 03:37:44.634]  We forget all of it.
[03:37:44.634 --> 03:37:49.557]  But the sad reality is there are groups that are generating all this stuff.
[03:37:49.557 --> 03:37:51.699]  They're creating high fructose corn syrup with mercury.
[03:37:51.699 --> 03:38:00.345]  The Washington Post in 2007 found that one-third of all processed foods containing high fructose corn syrup were full of mercury.
[03:38:00.345 --> 03:38:01.806]  And just as he mentioned with Fukushima,
[03:38:02.406 --> 03:38:05.288]  I've done extensive stuff on that, and so has Dr. Group.
[03:38:05.288 --> 03:38:08.930]  But I mean, they said the leak wasn't that bad.
[03:38:08.930 --> 03:38:12.071]  It was 1.5 times what they even said in the beginning.
[03:38:12.071 --> 03:38:16.974]  And then in 2013, it was leaking even more than the first month and the first year.
[03:38:16.974 --> 03:38:22.997]  It's going 72 to 73 percent of it is dumped, of the cesium, right into the Pacific Ocean.
[03:38:22.997 --> 03:38:24.238]  But we forget about that.
[03:38:24.238 --> 03:38:25.278]  We don't care about that.
[03:38:25.278 --> 03:38:27.920]  Until it blows up again, we're not going to care.
[03:38:27.920 --> 03:38:28.640]  Some of us care.
[03:38:28.640 --> 03:38:29.741]  I know you listening care.
[03:38:30.461 --> 03:38:39.466]  But the general population, we're constantly in a struggle pushing back against these corporations, against these establishment groups, that are just shoving it all on us.
[03:38:39.466 --> 03:38:40.926]  They're shoving it all on us.
[03:38:40.926 --> 03:38:49.511]  And the point of this show, you know, for me, and having Dr. Group on, is dumping all of that like a backpack full of bricks.
[03:38:49.511 --> 03:38:53.533]  The stress that's keeping you down, the hopelessness, the apathy, just all of it, just dump it!
[03:38:54.053 --> 03:38:55.194]  You can escape all of this.
[03:38:55.194 --> 03:38:56.795]  That's why we're talking about cleansing the body.
[03:38:56.795 --> 03:38:57.895]  Take control of your health.
[03:38:57.895 --> 03:38:59.736]  Take control of your life.
[03:38:59.736 --> 03:39:01.958]  And these are serious steps when he talks about this stuff.
[03:39:01.958 --> 03:39:04.279]  It's not like, oh yeah, I'll try and do that.
[03:39:04.279 --> 03:39:04.579]  No, no.
[03:39:04.579 --> 03:39:06.040]  It's time to get out of the system.
[03:39:06.040 --> 03:39:07.641]  Because they are controlling you.
[03:39:07.641 --> 03:39:09.883]  They are giving you poison to consume.
[03:39:10.743 --> 03:39:12.384]  And I'm not saying that for effect.
[03:39:12.384 --> 03:39:19.349]  I mean, we know that if you go to the grocery store, the processed foods contain real, serious, toxic poison.
[03:39:19.349 --> 03:39:22.651]  And it's not, it's not something that we should laugh about.
[03:39:22.651 --> 03:39:23.852]  These corporations don't care.
[03:39:23.852 --> 03:39:26.374]  It's just like the guy that jacked up the AIDS drug by 5,500%.
[03:39:26.374 --> 03:39:36.500]  There are sociopathic people, not even saying he's a sociopath, but you know, there are people out there that have sociopathic tendencies to just make money and hurt people.
[03:39:36.500 --> 03:39:37.261]  We are against that.
[03:39:37.261 --> 03:39:38.582]  We're standing against that, Dr. Group.
[03:39:40.385 --> 03:39:41.967]  I couldn't have said it better.
[03:39:41.967 --> 03:39:55.905]  You know, when you look at every single toxic chemical that's put out there from fragrances to environmental pollutants to cosmetics, sunscreen, pesticide residue, fire retardants, bug sprays,
[03:39:56.445 --> 03:40:03.227]  Son, you know, it's just the list goes on and on and on, and it's really, there is solutions, and that's what we're all about.
[03:40:03.227 --> 03:40:20.131]  We're all about giving people solutions to cleanse their body, reactivate their body's self-healing mechanism, and avoid as much as possible any of these chemical contaminates that are in their environment, that are exposed to at work and at home, because you have to sleep at night.
[03:40:20.131 --> 03:40:21.432]  You know, you might be sleeping on a
[03:40:22.612 --> 03:40:24.112]  A memory foam mattress.
[03:40:24.112 --> 03:40:28.073]  And you're inhaling a massive amount of toxic chemicals all night long.
[03:40:28.073 --> 03:40:29.634]  You know, just little things like that.
[03:40:29.634 --> 03:40:31.314]  Putting plants inside your home.
[03:40:31.314 --> 03:40:40.836]  But, like you said, spending more time with yourself instead of watching the news and watching all the fear-based and negative and negative and negative stuff.
[03:40:40.836 --> 03:40:43.076]  Because it is real easy to get wrapped up in it.
[03:40:43.076 --> 03:40:44.937]  We're living in a negative world right now.
[03:40:44.937 --> 03:40:45.837]  The Earth is sick.
[03:40:46.437 --> 03:40:54.561]  The Earth has negative frequencies being broadcast all over it, through the cell phone towers, through HAARP.
[03:40:54.561 --> 03:40:59.503]  People say, why don't you get into politics and be a senator and run for president sometimes?
[03:40:59.503 --> 03:41:06.547]  And I tell them, you're not ever going to create change in government the way it is right now.
[03:41:06.547 --> 03:41:10.589]  What we're doing, all of us, the grassroots effort,
[03:41:11.289 --> 03:41:21.921]  The activism that we're doing, we've done more for the planet and more for the world's population in the last 10 years than the government has done in the history of the government.
[03:41:21.921 --> 03:41:25.325]  It's about the people, the power of the people coming together.
[03:41:26.366 --> 03:41:31.488]  And standing up for what they believe in and not purchasing.
[03:41:31.488 --> 03:41:37.210]  That's how you really affect change, is to not buy the chemical-laced things.
[03:41:37.210 --> 03:41:42.791]  To call your senators about fluoride being in the water, trying to get it out.
[03:41:42.791 --> 03:41:46.513]  To look at the side effects of the pharmaceutical medications.
[03:41:46.513 --> 03:41:50.054]  To not believe the psychiatrists out there that are trying to sell you
[03:41:50.954 --> 03:41:58.738]  Psychiatric medications for what they made up as mental illness, which there's no such thing as mental illness.
[03:41:58.738 --> 03:41:59.358]  No, exactly.
[03:41:59.358 --> 03:42:11.745]  And it reminds me, not to interrupt, the 200 plus grocery stores I read about that aren't going to sell the GMO salmon, or the numerous companies that are taking high fructose corn syrup out of their products.
[03:42:11.745 --> 03:42:17.588]  They're being forced to change and take the GMOs out because of the activism that we're spreading right here.
[03:42:18.288 --> 03:42:20.509]  And at the end of the day, that's what it's all about.
[03:42:20.509 --> 03:42:21.529]  And you said it best.
[03:42:21.529 --> 03:42:22.749]  It's not even about politics.
[03:42:22.749 --> 03:42:24.269]  The third party reality is here.
[03:42:24.269 --> 03:42:26.070]  The political spectrum is dying.
[03:42:26.070 --> 03:42:28.570]  Once you enter the game, they are the game masters.
[03:42:28.570 --> 03:42:29.511]  You don't have to play the game.
[03:42:29.511 --> 03:42:30.711]  You're outside the game.
[03:42:30.711 --> 03:42:32.731]  You're influencing on a greater level.
[03:42:32.731 --> 03:42:34.652]  You're not going to play on their chessboard.
[03:42:34.652 --> 03:42:35.912]  That is how you lose.
[03:42:35.912 --> 03:42:39.893]  You're actively influencing from a much greater perspective and a much higher peak.
[03:42:41.923 --> 03:42:50.052]  Exactly, and that's why we're actually seeing, that's why they're running scared right now, and that's why they know that change is on the horizon.
[03:42:50.052 --> 03:42:50.972]  I mean, think about...
[03:42:52.042 --> 03:42:52.623]  How much?
[03:42:52.623 --> 03:42:54.284]  Just one chemical, BPA.
[03:42:54.284 --> 03:42:59.168]  There's 8 billion pounds of BPA produced a year.
[03:42:59.168 --> 03:43:03.131]  That's more than a pound for every single person on the planet.
[03:43:03.131 --> 03:43:08.596]  And you only need parts per million to create negative change in the system.
[03:43:08.596 --> 03:43:15.402]  So just if people were to understand that alone and write their senators and
[03:43:16.704 --> 03:43:19.165]  Bring awareness through email, through social media.
[03:43:19.165 --> 03:43:33.269]  That's another good reason that social media is out there, because it only takes one other person to send it to five other people, and then those five people send it to another ten people, and then those ten people send it to another fifty people.
[03:43:36.260 --> 03:44:02.628]  We're all here and most of the listeners that are out there that listen to Alex and that are aware of these things, we all know what needs to take place and we're all spreading the word on a daily basis and we've accomplished a lot of things in the last 10 years and we're just going to continue going and continue going and continue going until each thing fluorides out of the water, until they stop spraying chemtrails in the air, until they
[03:44:03.328 --> 03:44:09.293]  You know, start working and utilizing more natural medicine, which you're starting to see because there's a demand.
[03:44:09.293 --> 03:44:17.340]  Patients are walking into their doctor's offices and saying, hey, I don't want prescription medications, or what do you have that's natural that I can take?
[03:44:17.340 --> 03:44:20.462]  And the doctors are being forced to learn about natural medicine.
[03:44:20.462 --> 03:44:25.567]  I know because they contact me, they buy my book, they want to learn what we're doing.
[03:44:26.220 --> 03:44:27.201]  They do.
[03:44:27.201 --> 03:44:34.064]  So, it is a slow change and it is happening, but right now you have a massive amount of forces at play.
[03:44:34.064 --> 03:44:36.645]  Negative forces versus positive forces.
[03:44:36.645 --> 03:44:37.406]  Absolutely.
[03:44:37.406 --> 03:44:41.188]  And you know, I always say, feed your brain like you would your stomach.
[03:44:41.188 --> 03:44:44.870]  You wouldn't eat spam for a week straight.
[03:44:44.870 --> 03:44:54.015]  Or like, you wouldn't eat McDonald's hamburger, you know, unless you're mentally insane, for a whole week straight, unless you're making a documentary.
[03:44:54.977 --> 03:44:56.018]  Where you would just feel like crap.
[03:44:56.018 --> 03:44:56.860]  You'd get sick, right?
[03:44:56.860 --> 03:44:59.002]  You have to feed your brain in that same way.
[03:44:59.002 --> 03:45:02.487]  Your content consumption, your media consumption, your choosing.
[03:45:02.487 --> 03:45:03.969]  Think about it like you're eating food.
[03:45:03.969 --> 03:45:09.616]  When you go and you watch the mainstream media and it just talks about the wars and the famines and you're gonna die and there's crime in your area...
[03:45:10.077 --> 03:45:11.758]  Did you watch the Crime Tracker?
[03:45:11.758 --> 03:45:13.238]  There's burglaries in your area!
[03:45:13.238 --> 03:45:14.819]  You better be scared!
[03:45:14.819 --> 03:45:16.660]  You know, it's all just crap.
[03:45:16.660 --> 03:45:21.342]  And then you go online, and you look at the news, and it's all just angles to attack you with.
[03:45:21.342 --> 03:45:27.845]  It's just angles and political correctness and losing the foundations of what makes us human and what makes us connect with each other.
[03:45:27.845 --> 03:45:30.086]  Because now you're not even allowed to talk to people on the street.
[03:45:30.086 --> 03:45:30.927]  You're really not.
[03:45:30.927 --> 03:45:36.469]  If you go up to someone on the street, and I want to do a video about this, they look at you like you're crazy if you say, Hey, what's up, man?
[03:45:36.469 --> 03:45:37.189]  How are you doing?
[03:45:37.189 --> 03:45:38.210]  They're like, Oh my God!
[03:45:38.550 --> 03:45:42.372]  Someone is speaking to me, let alone shooting a video on the street, right?
[03:45:42.372 --> 03:45:48.196]  When we walk around and shoot videos about whatever on the street, people look and it's like, oh my god, right?
[03:45:48.196 --> 03:45:57.302]  All of our consumption, our brain consumption these days from the silly television shows, and it's fine to watch some of this stuff, but the mainstream media, it's all negative crap.
[03:45:57.302 --> 03:46:00.304]  It's like eating Cheez Whiz for a week straight, and it's killing you.
[03:46:01.044 --> 03:46:02.445]  And we're not even thinking about it.
[03:46:02.445 --> 03:46:06.830]  We're just consuming all the time, looking at stupid BuzzFeed articles, looking at stupid stuff.
[03:46:06.830 --> 03:46:09.452]  You have to eat wholesome, wholesome things for your brain.
[03:46:09.452 --> 03:46:11.254]  Feed your brain wholesome information.
[03:46:11.254 --> 03:46:15.078]  Listening to this program, listening to Solutions, listening to Dr. Group.
[03:46:15.078 --> 03:46:15.478]  Right?
[03:46:15.478 --> 03:46:16.659]  And you talk about social media.
[03:46:16.659 --> 03:46:17.960]  That's one of my favorite ways.
[03:46:18.581 --> 03:46:27.648]  I mean, Alex's page is huge, his InfoWars page is huge, your page, the Global Healing Center page, people like Bryant McGill reaching hundreds of millions every week.
[03:46:27.648 --> 03:46:30.049]  That's serious media consumption change.
[03:46:30.049 --> 03:46:40.377]  That is literally diluting the crap put out there from the mainstream media and changing the system from the grassroots and they can't silence that and that's the best part.
[03:46:40.377 --> 03:46:41.118]  We are winning.
[03:46:42.108 --> 03:46:52.871]  And if people just start changing their media consumption, their brain consumption, treating it like their bodies, man, if we could just have the minds changed and the bodies changed, we'd have a revolution tomorrow.
[03:46:52.871 --> 03:46:54.612]  Don't you think, Dr. Group?
[03:46:54.612 --> 03:47:07.236]  Yeah, one of the best ways to do that, actually, is to reverse the damage that's done to the brain through all the chemicals and all the heavy metals and especially the toxic halogens.
[03:47:07.236 --> 03:47:11.017]  One of the reasons why we did Survival Shield and Deep Cleanse, because
[03:47:12.392 --> 03:47:15.373]  You want to get that mind back to a normal state.
[03:47:15.373 --> 03:47:18.533]  Like I was talking about earlier, there is no such thing as mental illness.
[03:47:18.533 --> 03:47:33.036]  All it is, is a toxic slew of chemicals that are creating the misfiring of the nerves in your mind and creating depression, anxiety, stress, and all the other things that they're labeling as mental illness.
[03:47:33.036 --> 03:47:41.418]  But yeah, one of the best ways to do that, the Germans and the Russians years ago, they used fluoride to calcify the pineal gland to take away your connection with God.
[03:47:41.418 --> 03:47:41.598]  So,
[03:47:42.618 --> 03:47:45.319]  And your third eye to calcify it and make it hard.
[03:47:45.319 --> 03:47:57.561]  So when you start to detoxify the body and you clean your body, it's just like a kitchen that you cook and eat three meals a day in and you never clean up after yourself.
[03:47:57.561 --> 03:48:02.942]  After about a week, you're going to have mold and fungus and bacteria and viruses growing in there.
[03:48:02.942 --> 03:48:07.003]  And if you walk in and breathe that in, it's a diseased area.
[03:48:07.003 --> 03:48:08.063]  It's a diseased state.
[03:48:08.991 --> 03:48:11.813]  That's what's happening with most people's bodies right now.
[03:48:11.813 --> 03:48:17.876]  From all the chemicals and everything that they're taking in every single day, and they're not cleaning the inside of their bodies.
[03:48:17.876 --> 03:48:27.002]  So it's accumulating and accumulating and accumulating, and our job is to educate people as to why that is.
[03:48:27.002 --> 03:48:30.384]  I mean, that's what we spent all of our years doing research on.
[03:48:30.384 --> 03:48:32.225]  What is the root cause of disease?
[03:48:32.765 --> 03:48:41.833]  I don't want people walking in my office with a bunch of symptoms and I'm going to hand them a prescription medication for their headache or for their arthritis or for their diabetes.
[03:48:41.833 --> 03:48:47.378]  Or I don't even want to hand them a natural product for their diabetes or their heart disease or anything like that.
[03:48:47.378 --> 03:48:58.287]  What I want to do is address the root cause of the problem and explain to them why they have diabetes, why they have heart disease, and what they can do to fix it once and for all.
[03:48:58.287 --> 03:48:59.228]  And that's why
[03:49:00.109 --> 03:49:10.396]  The development of all the products for the Infowars Life and the things that we do are not addressed to try to sell people a bunch of stuff and make a bunch of money.
[03:49:10.396 --> 03:49:26.768]  Yes, it's great that we can support the activism movement and educate more people, but it's about really addressing and cleansing and eliminating, and it's the solution to what we're being bombarded with.
[03:49:26.768 --> 03:49:28.129]  Especially with the iodine.
[03:49:28.129 --> 03:49:29.270]  It's designed to de-
[03:49:31.298 --> 03:49:43.845]  Decalcify and to help cleanse the thyroid, the pineal gland to bring back, you have the not only toxic fluoride, but you have bromine and chlorine and those are everywhere.
[03:49:43.845 --> 03:49:46.067]  I mean, look at the water systems.
[03:49:46.067 --> 03:49:54.832]  And so when you have an accumulation of all these chemicals and then you have a restricted element that everybody needs, such as iodine.
[03:49:55.712 --> 03:50:20.661]  That is the whole purpose of getting the body back to normal by cleansing all these things, by doing intestinal cleansing, by doing liver and gallbladder cleansing, by using the deep cleanse and doing real good cellular cleansing and assisting the body in eliminating all these chemicals and toxins that are just bringing your energy levels down, causing fatigue, headaches.
[03:50:20.661 --> 03:50:21.261]  I tell you what,
[03:50:22.435 --> 03:50:33.482]  Practically every single person in the United States over the age of 12 is suffering from some form of symptom on a daily basis or some health problem.
[03:50:33.482 --> 03:50:34.483]  No, it's absolutely true.
[03:50:34.483 --> 03:50:35.043]  And you know what?
[03:50:35.043 --> 03:50:42.929]  We're not the people raising the price of the AIDS pharmaceutical drug by 5,500% from $13 to $750 a pill.
[03:50:42.929 --> 03:50:45.130]  Real products that matter, that make a difference.
[03:50:45.130 --> 03:50:45.771]  And guess what?
[03:50:45.771 --> 03:50:49.553]  Financial support is a good thing when it's right intentioned and it supports the movement.
[03:50:49.553 --> 03:50:50.013]  Thanks a lot.
[03:50:50.013 --> 03:50:50.554]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:00.424 --> 03:51:09.147]  My name is Don Whiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:09.147 --> 03:51:10.607]  What did I do?
[03:51:10.607 --> 03:51:18.549]  I created ExtendoVite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.
[03:51:18.549 --> 03:51:26.972]  For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available to you, so you don't have to suffer the same thing I did.
[03:51:27.512 --> 03:51:32.694]  Clean your blocked arteries and strengthen your heart and boost your natural immune system.
[03:51:32.694 --> 03:51:36.355]  I'm 60 years old now and I still work every day.
[03:51:36.355 --> 03:51:38.236]  To get your Xtendivite, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:38.236 --> 03:51:39.237]  That's 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.
[03:51:39.237 --> 03:51:42.258]  Xtendivite is only $69.95 for a 2-month supply of either capsules or liquid.

[03:53:01.755 --> 03:53:06.396]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[03:53:06.396 --> 03:53:10.677]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[03:53:10.677 --> 03:53:12.058]  We typically do the same thing.
[03:53:12.058 --> 03:53:15.079]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[03:53:15.079 --> 03:53:17.299]  But have you considered heat storage?
[03:53:17.299 --> 03:53:19.500]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[03:53:19.500 --> 03:53:21.781]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[03:53:21.781 --> 03:53:23.421]  How will I keep my family warm?
[03:53:23.421 --> 03:53:25.922]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[03:53:25.922 --> 03:53:29.963]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[03:53:30.803 --> 03:53:31.924]  Another concern?
[03:53:31.924 --> 03:53:35.907]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[03:53:35.907 --> 03:53:38.489]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[03:53:38.489 --> 03:53:42.472]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[03:53:42.472 --> 03:53:45.274]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[03:53:45.274 --> 03:53:49.918]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[03:53:49.918 --> 03:53:51.919]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[03:53:51.919 --> 03:53:53.561]  FortressClothing.com.
[03:53:53.561 --> 03:53:54.922]  You'll never be cold again.
[03:54:09.023 --> 03:54:28.109]  We spent over a year trying to put together something for somebody, for everybody, especially working with Alex and the team over here at InfoWars Life, to create a product that would focus on helping people clean environmental chemicals and toxins from their body and how to detox those from the system.
[03:54:28.109 --> 03:54:34.651]  We have a lot of good products over here from the X2, all of the liver cleanse products, the oxy powder, the
[03:54:35.131 --> 03:54:36.793]  Winter sun, I mean, you name it.
[03:54:36.793 --> 03:54:38.494]  Down the line, everything is great.
[03:54:38.494 --> 03:54:46.563]  Today though, I'm really excited because this is something that you guys have the exclusive for, which is a product called Deep Cleanse.
[03:54:46.563 --> 03:54:49.786]  And why I'm so excited about it is it's a unique formula
[03:54:50.166 --> 03:54:56.291]  Almost like the iodine crystals, we have two unique products that nobody in the world has.
[03:54:56.291 --> 03:55:11.303]  One of the most amazing ingredients in the world, and it's called shilajit, and it's actually known as blood of the mountain or rock sweat because thousands of years ago, as a matter of fact, this ingredient was only given to the elite of the elite.
[03:55:11.303 --> 03:55:18.469]  Thousands of years ago, up in the Himalayan mountains and in Tibet... And we wanted to put this in stuff for a couple years, but we couldn't get an organic form.
[03:55:18.689 --> 03:55:19.089]  Right.
[03:55:19.089 --> 03:55:20.090]  Let's explain.
[03:55:20.090 --> 03:55:23.513]  I mean, this stuff is so good we couldn't put it out for years.
[03:55:23.513 --> 03:55:23.894]  Right.
[03:55:23.894 --> 03:55:32.261]  So I had to actually, it's kind of like the iodine crystals, finding a source deep in the earth that we could get the cleanest source available.
[03:55:32.261 --> 03:55:41.649]  But in Tibet and in Nepal and in the Himalayan mountains, thousands of years ago they found, they watched these monkeys and during the summer months the monkeys would go up into the mountains.
[03:55:41.649 --> 03:55:42.930]  Now you're being racist against monkeys.
[03:55:42.930 --> 03:55:43.571]  And they would pick
[03:55:44.031 --> 03:55:46.852]  This black substance from the mountains.
[03:55:46.852 --> 03:55:53.334]  And so in Russia, they actually, it grows in Russia and the mountains and in the Himalayas and only in the summer.
[03:55:53.334 --> 03:56:01.417]  And chilajit is actually the decomposition of up to 7,000 different medicinal herbs.
[03:56:01.417 --> 03:56:08.199]  So it decomposes, all these different herbs decompose in the Himalayan mountains and the volcanic soil up there.
[03:56:08.199 --> 03:56:12.161]  And what happens in the summertime... So it's almost like an oil from
[03:56:13.001 --> 03:56:15.843]  Yes, it's high in fulvic acid, it's high in humic acid.
[03:56:15.843 --> 03:56:20.485]  They're always claiming oil is really from decomposed animals and plants.
[03:56:20.485 --> 03:56:25.407]  There is some oil that is based from fossils, but most of it's really abiotic.
[03:56:25.407 --> 03:56:29.209]  So this is a true fossil source?
[03:56:29.209 --> 03:56:29.890]  I mean, explain it to me.
[03:56:30.590 --> 03:56:44.053]  It's really the decomposition, like I said, of over 7,000 different medicinal herbs and plants and with the rocks and the pressure deep in the mountains it freezes and during the summertime and the pressures build it up.
[03:56:44.053 --> 03:56:45.453]  It oozes out.
[03:56:45.453 --> 03:56:46.993]  So it literally oozes out of the mountain.
[03:56:46.993 --> 03:56:48.153]  It's like rock sap.
[03:56:48.153 --> 03:56:49.174]  It's like rock sap.
[03:56:49.174 --> 03:56:53.054]  It's black and it's highly nutritious.
[03:56:53.054 --> 03:56:55.615]  Even in the 1980s when the Olympic
[03:56:56.315 --> 03:56:58.637]  Athletes in Russia were accused of being on steroids.
[03:56:58.637 --> 03:57:06.041]  They found out that they were actually been given Shilajit because it works as an anabolic as well and it builds muscles.
[03:57:06.041 --> 03:57:07.102]  It's a big dose in there.
[03:57:07.102 --> 03:57:11.164]  The second big main ingredient in there is a volcanic zeolite concentrate.
[03:57:11.164 --> 03:57:17.068]  And what this formula is designed to do, the Shilajit and the zeolites have a real strong negative charge.
[03:57:17.068 --> 03:57:21.911]  All the metals and chemicals and PCBs and VOCs have positive charges.
[03:57:22.691 --> 03:57:30.674]  So these go in, they grab it, and then they safely eliminate it through the body so you can become healthy.
[03:57:30.674 --> 03:57:34.656]  I mean, this is an amazing formula.
[03:57:34.656 --> 03:57:40.418]  I wish I actually had it, but because this was an exclusive InfoWars Life product, you're the only one in the world that has.
[03:57:41.058 --> 03:57:41.819]  How do people take it?
[03:57:41.819 --> 03:57:43.960]  How is it recommended that this be done?
[03:57:43.960 --> 03:57:44.520]  Just a daily dose?
[03:58:11.118 --> 03:58:19.781]  But personally, I'm gonna probably take it every day, every other day, and I'll probably go with about a dropper full to maybe two dropper fulls.
[03:58:19.781 --> 03:58:23.923]  And I don't expose myself to any chemicals, but... But it's out there in the air, it's in everything.
[03:58:23.923 --> 03:58:25.243]  Well, I mean, I tell you what I do.
[03:58:25.243 --> 03:58:26.844]  I've never been a supplement person.
[03:58:26.844 --> 03:58:35.847]  I keep it now on the kitchen table with a Lazy Susan, and when I just make myself take it all every day, I feel so much better.
