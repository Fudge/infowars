[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.759]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:15.253 --> 00:00:15.893]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:17.594]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.334 --> 00:00:19.435]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.095 --> 00:00:20.895]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:22.556]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.236 --> 00:00:26.877]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.418 --> 00:00:31.499]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.435]  If open treason was unfolding against the people of the United States and the planet, would anyone notice?
[00:00:54.596 --> 00:01:01.680]  Well, only if the people themselves that are historically informed recognize the threat and take action to warn others.
[00:01:03.842 --> 00:01:11.967]  We have a very important broadcast obviously lined up for you today on this live Worldwide Friday transmission.
[00:01:14.502 --> 00:01:25.010]  That said, we have a raft of special reports that are pretty bombshell that we're going to be airing and premiering here on air today.
[00:01:28.453 --> 00:01:32.356]  So you'll definitely want to stay with us for that.
[00:01:33.057 --> 00:01:36.700]  In fact, guys, I just had my entire video list in here marked up.
[00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:40.372]  And now I can't find it again.
[00:01:40.692 --> 00:01:45.115]  So the easiest thing to do is just bring me the video list again.
[00:01:45.135 --> 00:01:48.777]  And I'm going to be honest with listeners tuning in.
[00:01:50.238 --> 00:02:02.186]  What I'm looking at here is so over the top that I'm having one of those rare moments where I can't talk.
[00:02:08.212 --> 00:02:21.843]  And it's because I don't have words to properly break down how serious things are.
[00:02:26.147 --> 00:02:37.556]  They say that John the Revelator marveled in speechlessness as he was being given the revelation of end times and Armageddon.
[00:02:39.943 --> 00:02:41.324]  He marveled at the beast.
[00:02:43.584 --> 00:02:46.826]  And I've not been given some revelation 2,000 years ago.
[00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:48.126]  I'm here watching it.
[00:02:49.507 --> 00:03:03.992]  And I'm watching the general public, somewhat awake in some areas, but not awake in others, having no idea how fantastical, how sensational reality really is.
[00:03:11.914 --> 00:03:16.615]  I told you over and over again that political correctness in the colleges are re-education camps.
[00:03:18.936 --> 00:03:31.820]  I told you Starbucks announcing that they're going to henpeck you and demand that you talk about race when you buy coffee to create division and create hysteria and create mental illness was a re-education camp tactic.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.362]  Hillary Clinton has come out and called for re-education camps for adults to force us to talk about race and more.
[00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:43.050]  And you're like, oh, that'll never happen.
[00:03:43.190 --> 00:04:00.157]  Really, Obamacare would never happen, totally open borders would never happen, world government would never happen, the government pulling you over and taking the money out of your car without a warrant or even drugs, that's in the Forbes magazine today, the DEA is seizing cash without warrants in its version of stop and frisk.
[00:04:03.158 --> 00:04:04.679]  I've had a chance to read the entire U.S.
[00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:08.440]  Army Special Operations Command, unclassified, F-O-U-O,
[00:04:11.294 --> 00:04:15.778]  Request to conduct military training RMT Jade Helm 15.
[00:04:20.442 --> 00:04:22.503]  And that ties into the Hillary Clinton situation.
[00:04:24.545 --> 00:04:30.190]  So I'm going to just catch my breath here and I'm going to try to compose myself during the break and think about how do I tackle this.
[00:04:33.953 --> 00:04:35.434]  Because you have to understand something.
[00:04:39.451 --> 00:04:41.633]  There's actually only two states they list in red.
[00:04:42.894 --> 00:04:43.855]  This is the U.S.
[00:04:44.496 --> 00:04:46.257]  occupied, seized federal government.
[00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:47.899]  Do you realize those aren't words?
[00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:48.780]  That's reality.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.640]  That's not rhetoric.
[00:04:51.122 --> 00:04:53.384]  The federal government has been seized by foreign banks.
[00:04:55.726 --> 00:04:58.228]  They've appointed presidents in places like Italy.
[00:05:01.571 --> 00:05:05.135]  They call themselves totalitarian autocratic technocrats.
[00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:13.211]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[00:05:13.971 --> 00:05:20.215]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:29.380]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.

[00:05:39.298 --> 00:05:42.799]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.921]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:48.682]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:49.002 --> 00:05:54.024]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[00:05:54.344 --> 00:05:56.585]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[00:05:56.865 --> 00:05:57.706]  But for how long?
[00:05:58.006 --> 00:06:00.007]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:06:00.227 --> 00:06:04.269]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:05.809]  Infidel Body Armor.
[00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:07.450]  Just won't quit.
[00:06:09.172 --> 00:06:10.053]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:10.553]  Good, brother.
[00:06:10.693 --> 00:06:12.374]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:06:12.655 --> 00:06:14.216]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:06:14.376 --> 00:06:18.379]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:20.980]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:23.282]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:06:23.442 --> 00:06:31.308]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:06:31.688 --> 00:06:34.732]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:06:34.852 --> 00:06:36.354]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:06:36.394 --> 00:06:39.298]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:06:39.438 --> 00:06:40.800]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.564]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[00:06:43.824 --> 00:06:46.888]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated.
[00:06:47.148 --> 00:06:48.730]  Or maximum potency.
[00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:55.096]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience.
[00:06:55.396 --> 00:06:59.079]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:00.881]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[00:07:00.941 --> 00:07:07.888]  Visit Infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from Infowarslife.
[00:07:09.233 --> 00:07:18.757]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:28.642]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy-Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:07:28.822 --> 00:07:31.743]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[00:07:31.943 --> 00:07:32.223]  I think.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.160]  We're good.
[00:08:18.849 --> 00:08:22.350]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:08:22.951 --> 00:08:24.751]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.272 --> 00:08:36.375]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to cover, undoubtedly here today, the most important information we've ever gone over.
[00:08:37.516 --> 00:08:40.457]  Now, in my 20 years on air, I've probably said that 50 times.
[00:08:42.461 --> 00:08:53.187]  And it's because as we progress down this globalist road, we hit milestones of incredibly positive things, but also incredibly sad and negative dark things.
[00:08:55.909 --> 00:08:57.870]  And I'm going to go over the facts here.
[00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:09.557]  There has been a long-term, at least 20-year program to militarize the police and prepare the military itself for governing the United States
[00:09:10.914 --> 00:09:21.539]  Under an emergency restructuring of the United States into the North American Union under unelected global private corporate trade boards and secret treaties.
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.440]  We would tell you about this 20 years ago.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.162]  Lou Dobbs would tell you about it 10 years ago and basically got fired.
[00:09:28.162 --> 00:09:29.423]  Now none of that is denied.
[00:09:29.463 --> 00:09:30.343]  It's all out in the open.
[00:09:30.363 --> 00:09:34.285]  They go, yeah, the global treaties are secret and you're now under foreign corporate control.
[00:09:35.543 --> 00:09:36.884]  We are being captured.
[00:09:36.944 --> 00:09:38.064]  We are being seized.
[00:09:38.184 --> 00:09:44.547]  The federal government has been taken over for a long time, but it doesn't control all the states, the counties, the cities.
[00:09:44.627 --> 00:10:00.353]  Now, about a month ago, I was up in North Texas with a well-known billionaire, Chuck Norris' son, Mike Norris, the filmmaker.
[00:10:01.594 --> 00:10:12.998]  and some law enforcement people and others and got some key intel that dovetail with information I had from Fort Hood and that I had separately from our sources in the statehouse at the highest levels.
[00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:27.664]  That the state of Texas is aware of a takeover plan to bring us into martial law and to actually basically arrest state officials and that Texas will be the first state to be taken down under martial law.
[00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:41.031]  Now, I mentioned some of that back then, but I said I was allowed to talk about it, but that it was so hardcore that I wanted to collate more data before I told you what I was told exactly.
[00:10:42.352 --> 00:10:50.820]  From the Fort Hood sources, from the Statehouse sources, and from the basically Chuck Norris Combine sources.
[00:10:55.123 --> 00:10:56.825]  This is so much stranger than fiction.
[00:11:01.465 --> 00:11:07.388]  And you've heard state judges come out and say, we know there's a martial law plan for Texas and Lubbock and other areas.
[00:11:07.808 --> 00:11:08.608]  This is known.
[00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:18.633]  I've had three different groups from Fort Hood come to events that I've been at.
[00:11:20.985 --> 00:11:23.746]  And they're sincere in what they say and what they're doing.
[00:11:23.786 --> 00:11:34.651]  And they're completely freaked out because they're now been told to engage in preparations for the takedown of counties and cities in Texas and of the state capitol.
[00:11:36.072 --> 00:11:38.553]  This is very dangerous information, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:40.134 --> 00:11:46.897]  Now, one of our insider sources said, hey, this is an open source document, but they've got it hidden on one of their servers.
[00:11:47.961 --> 00:11:49.441]  That's public, but not listed.
[00:11:50.361 --> 00:11:52.102]  But by law, they're supposed to put this out.
[00:11:52.262 --> 00:11:52.542]  U.S.
[00:11:52.582 --> 00:11:59.403]  Army Special Operations Command requests to conduct realistic military training RMT Jade Helm 15.
[00:12:00.043 --> 00:12:05.464]  It's a joint forces under NORTHCOM out of Colorado Springs and out of the U.S.
[00:12:05.504 --> 00:12:07.464]  Army Special Operations Command out of Florida.
[00:12:09.205 --> 00:12:16.366]  And it is a unified program for two command bases to basically take over the entire state of Texas.
[00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:27.005]  And they list in the official document two states in one zone they believe during a takedown of the Constitutional Republic.
[00:12:28.015 --> 00:12:37.919]  That they will, and this is all in here, that they will get resistance in, and that's because they have NSA data, they have future predicting systems.
[00:12:38.319 --> 00:12:40.740]  They also know, if I know this stuff, they know this.
[00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:50.685]  They know that Utah, led by the Mormons, say what you want about them, the Mormons have been playing along with the government, but the globalists have them all wiretapped and spied on.
[00:12:50.925 --> 00:12:53.106]  They know the Mormons actually have plans to not go along.
[00:12:53.786 --> 00:12:55.367]  Very rebellious to the globalists.
[00:12:56.388 --> 00:12:58.929]  And they've also been smart enough to put their people throughout the government.
[00:12:59.469 --> 00:13:01.230]  They've got a takedown plan at Utah.
[00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.171]  They've got a takedown plan at Texas.
[00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:04.752]  We're listed as hostile.
[00:13:05.352 --> 00:13:11.216]  That's because that's basically all there is left in the country, at a governmental level, of anybody they think will resist.
[00:13:11.976 --> 00:13:13.097]  They've got the demographics.
[00:13:13.117 --> 00:13:16.218]  They've got the people in government either on the payroll or spied on everywhere else.
[00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:18.660]  When Governor Abbott got elected,
[00:13:19.588 --> 00:13:21.088]  Who we know is the real deal.
[00:13:21.749 --> 00:13:23.029]  And I know this from private sources.
[00:13:23.049 --> 00:13:23.829]  I've known him for years.
[00:13:24.229 --> 00:13:25.469]  He's a very good Christian man.
[00:13:25.489 --> 00:13:26.710]  You know, the governor in the wheelchair.
[00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:31.091]  He knows what's going on and has been having private meetings.
[00:13:31.231 --> 00:13:32.711]  I'm just going to leave it at that with people.
[00:13:33.291 --> 00:13:34.472]  Because these are not traitors.
[00:13:34.552 --> 00:13:36.472]  I mean, they understand America's dying right now.
[00:13:36.492 --> 00:13:37.032]  Okay, folks?
[00:13:37.432 --> 00:13:38.293]  The country's gone.
[00:13:38.333 --> 00:13:39.193]  The borders are gone.
[00:13:39.473 --> 00:13:40.353]  They're bankrupting us.
[00:13:40.473 --> 00:13:41.493]  We're going into slavery.
[00:13:41.533 --> 00:13:44.614]  This is like France got taken down from within by the Vichy.
[00:13:45.114 --> 00:13:46.355]  Hitler didn't take over France.
[00:13:46.395 --> 00:13:47.315]  The generals stood down.
[00:13:48.086 --> 00:13:51.227]  Then he just chased the British Expeditionary Force out to Dunkirk.
[00:13:51.948 --> 00:13:57.930]  And then the French... I mean, Hitler, a week after the invasion, was already in Paris, with the police directing traffic for him.
[00:13:58.811 --> 00:14:00.972]  And that's the type of takeover we see happening.
[00:14:02.072 --> 00:14:04.253]  And Texas and Utah are aware of this.
[00:14:05.494 --> 00:14:11.076]  They also have an area about 40 miles into California that's controlled by Mexican drug cartels that the U.S.
[00:14:11.156 --> 00:14:14.358]  Army expects to receive resistance when they try to occupy it.
[00:14:14.983 --> 00:14:25.987]  Three areas in the United States, in this jurisdiction, they don't list on the map the Midwest, but I'll guarantee you Indiana's on it, and I'll guarantee you New Hampshire's somewhat on it.
[00:14:27.588 --> 00:14:30.829]  And I'll guarantee you to a certain extent Tennessee's on it when we get the full map.
[00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:32.750]  The rest of this is classified.
[00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:39.273]  But this is because they're now putting this out in the public as a psy-op to hide it in plain view.
[00:14:42.194 --> 00:14:44.575]  That yes, we're preparing for national stabilization,
[00:14:45.882 --> 00:14:48.083]  And that we're preparing to win the hearts and minds locally.
[00:14:48.143 --> 00:14:50.205]  It says that in the document, it's in our article as well.
[00:14:50.565 --> 00:14:53.086]  Then they add, oh and also this is good training for overseas.
[00:14:54.467 --> 00:15:05.113]  Now it's interesting, this was the biggest, or you could argue second largest prisoner of war camp in World War II was Camp Swift out between Bastrop and Smithville.
[00:15:09.206 --> 00:15:11.207]  We've known about this for a long time, but this is it.
[00:15:40.677 --> 00:15:43.378]  They're training to take over, basically, government buildings.
[00:15:44.298 --> 00:15:53.422]  To go into hardened courthouses, the Capitol, and basically take the governor and other people out.
[00:15:55.242 --> 00:15:57.143]  And that's in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[00:15:57.183 --> 00:15:57.803]  Bush was involved, 1997.
[00:15:58.283 --> 00:15:59.744]  Excuse me, 2007.
[00:16:00.804 --> 00:16:07.627]  The John Warner Defense Authorization Act says, for insurrection of the states, including by the state legislatures or governors.
[00:16:08.732 --> 00:16:10.793]  It's not insurrection, it's duty.
[00:16:11.193 --> 00:16:13.815]  The government's been seized at the federal level.
[00:16:14.215 --> 00:16:15.276]  We're wide open.
[00:16:18.337 --> 00:16:23.880]  And now they're going to deploy massive amounts of military to practice basically taking over Austin.
[00:16:24.781 --> 00:16:28.383]  They're going to have helicopters flying around downtown, explosions, all of it.
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.681]  And they even talk about running into opposition when they do it, and they're talking about me.
[00:16:33.741 --> 00:16:35.722]  I'm the famous guy for chasing the black helicopters.
[00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:46.525]  Only because the San Antonio Police Chief, Houston Police, Kingsville Emergency Manager, Thomas Sanchez was Army Intelligence, and they came to him and said it's martial law training for gun confiscation.
[00:16:46.565 --> 00:16:49.686]  Clinton wants to test the states and see who's going to be in opposition.
[00:16:50.246 --> 00:16:52.186]  Well, they know from the demographics.
[00:16:52.206 --> 00:16:57.248]  The reason they're worried about Texas and Utah, and I'm not saying these governments are perfect,
[00:16:58.322 --> 00:17:00.423]  We're probably going to get Joel Skousen on immediately.
[00:17:00.443 --> 00:17:01.764]  In fact, even today.
[00:17:01.804 --> 00:17:09.767]  I know we've got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, and I know we've got John McAfee coming on, but maybe at 1, we've got 30 minutes there, 1 to 1.30.
[00:17:10.788 --> 00:17:22.433]  Get him on, because I know he has high-level sources in the Utah government, in the Salt Lake government, and he's been talking about believing Texas and Utah would be the main opposition points.
[00:17:23.454 --> 00:17:26.315]  Texas has been so overrun by third-world populations, though, that
[00:17:27.438 --> 00:17:31.160]  The entire East and South will fall pretty much immediately to the Feds.
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:38.603]  And they think the big war, the top analysts, is going to be fought in the Hill Country and into West Texas and the Panhandle.
[00:17:40.244 --> 00:17:42.545]  This is what the Pentagon's training for, folks.
[00:17:42.925 --> 00:17:44.526]  I mean, this is high treason.
[00:17:44.946 --> 00:17:47.227]  This is over the top.
[00:17:50.869 --> 00:17:53.570]  And I cannot believe we've fallen this far.
[00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:56.272]  I already knew about all this in these maps.
[00:17:57.446 --> 00:18:00.088]  I already knew they were training at Fort Hood to take out the government.
[00:18:00.689 --> 00:18:03.031]  And why do you think the military is so awake?
[00:18:03.071 --> 00:18:05.212]  They are going, what on what?
[00:18:07.014 --> 00:18:09.916]  Training to take over government buildings in Texas?
[00:18:11.978 --> 00:18:12.859]  Are you joking?
[00:18:12.879 --> 00:18:18.663]  And that's why they fired hundreds of generals, thousands of officers under them.
[00:18:18.683 --> 00:18:22.226]  I mean, they are just, because they are finding out who will go along.
[00:18:22.847 --> 00:18:25.009]  They've got to train for this to identify.
[00:18:25.933 --> 00:18:27.153]  They're enemies in the military.
[00:18:27.994 --> 00:18:29.094]  Because they're going to purge that.
[00:18:29.114 --> 00:18:30.234]  And let me tell the military something.
[00:18:31.395 --> 00:18:37.137]  If you kind of halfway go along with this, and they carry out this purge, read about Night of the Long Knives.
[00:18:38.357 --> 00:18:44.939]  The first thing the globalists will do, and they've done this in every country they control and so have other similar systems, they always follow the same narrative.
[00:18:45.819 --> 00:18:47.940]  It's criminology, but it also works.
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.402]  You think they hate veterans now and police?
[00:18:52.662 --> 00:18:57.746]  You help carry out the slitting of the throat of this country and the heart of this country?
[00:19:00.068 --> 00:19:03.070]  You are deader than a hammer and it's not going to be Alex Jones coming after you.
[00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:08.394]  The globalists are going to come after you and they are going to kill hundreds of thousands of you fools that go along with this.
[00:19:10.536 --> 00:19:11.536]  It's a guarantee.
[00:19:11.576 --> 00:19:12.417]  The Soviets did it.
[00:19:12.457 --> 00:19:13.278]  The Nazis did it.
[00:19:13.338 --> 00:19:13.938]  Mao did it.
[00:19:13.998 --> 00:19:14.779]  Castro did it.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.981]  Hugo Chavez did it.
[00:19:18.061 --> 00:19:18.562]  I just can't...
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.742]  And I'm going to tell everybody something either.
[00:19:20.822 --> 00:19:24.808]  Either you triple down getting the word out and exposing this, or you need to evacuate now.
[00:19:25.288 --> 00:19:29.394]  Now is the time to evacuate the United States, I can tell you unequivocally.
[00:19:29.875 --> 00:19:32.218]  You'll run for a while, you won't be safe in the end.
[00:19:35.876 --> 00:19:40.840]  But the fact that they're bringing this stuff out with the constellation of other news I'm going to cover when we come back?
[00:19:41.481 --> 00:19:47.045]  Hillary has come out on TV and called for adults to be made to go to re-education camps for racism.
[00:19:47.426 --> 00:19:49.868]  That all adults, this is what National Service is going to be.
[00:19:49.888 --> 00:19:51.209]  It's not going to be military.
[00:19:51.709 --> 00:19:55.032]  It's going to be into these new Homeland Tattletail Brigades.
[00:19:55.752 --> 00:19:56.733]  You're like, are you joking?
[00:19:56.793 --> 00:19:57.494]  No, I'm not joking.
[00:19:57.794 --> 00:19:58.495]  I mean, I told you.
[00:20:00.336 --> 00:20:00.676]  After they...
[00:20:02.028 --> 00:20:03.029]  They're going to carry out terrorism.
[00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:04.872]  They're going to blame it on the Tea Party.
[00:20:04.892 --> 00:20:06.974]  They're going to make everybody go to re-education camps.
[00:20:07.435 --> 00:20:08.056]  I'm not joking!
[00:20:09.304 --> 00:20:10.024]  I'm Mike Huckabee.
[00:20:10.104 --> 00:20:14.406]  I was the governor of Arkansas and ran for president in 2008, and I used to be a diabetic.
[00:20:14.526 --> 00:20:19.987]  One of the coolest campaigns I ever took on and won was the crusade that reversed my type 2 diabetes naturally.
[00:20:20.107 --> 00:20:25.029]  I was able to get off the medications I'd taken, and I lost 110 pounds of fat in the process.
[00:20:25.229 --> 00:20:31.711]  If you or someone you care about has type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, I urge you to pay close attention to what I'm about to tell you.
[00:20:31.871 --> 00:20:38.253]  The same methods I used to reverse my type 2 diabetes are found today in the Diabetes Solution Kit from Barton Publishing.

[00:21:23.012 --> 00:21:23.633]  I think so.
[00:21:44.275 --> 00:21:44.755]  We're good.
[00:22:09.022 --> 00:22:17.807]  As the New World Order continues to tighten its grip on every facet of our lives, we're all asking ourselves, how can we maintain our independence?
[00:22:18.608 --> 00:22:19.708]  The answer is clear.
[00:22:20.169 --> 00:22:22.190]  Get prepared and you get prepared now.
[00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.332]  Now the only question left is where do we begin?

[00:23:38.104 --> 00:23:40.686]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[00:23:40.826 --> 00:23:44.830]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:46.371]  Silverlungs.com.

[00:23:54.557 --> 00:23:56.299]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[00:23:56.459 --> 00:24:01.783]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.

[00:24:05.826 --> 00:24:07.328]  That's Silverlungs.com.
[00:24:21.417 --> 00:24:29.583]  Joe Biggs just basically got threatened, but Southcom just got in his face.
[00:24:30.223 --> 00:24:30.424]  U.S.
[00:24:30.464 --> 00:24:37.489]  Army Special Operations Command, one of his good friends from the military, sent him a text saying, we need to shut up about this.
[00:24:38.349 --> 00:24:42.072]  I mean, we're looking at Texas listed in Utah as hostile.
[00:24:43.453 --> 00:24:45.414]  They say they're here to condition us and prepare us.
[00:24:45.454 --> 00:24:51.436]  I have a stack of mainstream news articles documenting that they're preparing to, quote, use the military against gun owners and the Tea Party.
[00:24:51.816 --> 00:24:54.737]  They ordered the National Guard to confiscate guns during Katrina.
[00:24:55.397 --> 00:24:57.758]  I've got Hillary calling for re-education camps.
[00:24:58.578 --> 00:24:59.898]  You cannot make this up.
[00:24:59.938 --> 00:25:01.539]  Videos on Infowars.com.
[00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:04.100]  Hillary, we need fun camps for adults.
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.260]  They're preparing!
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.581]  The border's wide open!
[00:25:08.943 --> 00:25:12.065]  And we know about the civilian inmate labor camp program.
[00:25:12.105 --> 00:25:14.027]  We know about their plan.
[00:25:14.627 --> 00:25:18.670]  And we're not saying the military's bad, just like the German military wasn't bad at first.
[00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:19.731]  Hitler was bad.
[00:25:20.331 --> 00:25:22.833]  You have bad people running it.
[00:25:22.873 --> 00:25:24.314]  And we know most of the military's awake.
[00:25:24.354 --> 00:25:27.356]  But Joe, unprecedented, what did your friend say to you?
[00:25:27.916 --> 00:25:31.038]  So yeah, this is a guy that I served with in Iraq a long time ago.
[00:25:31.658 --> 00:25:35.840]  And he now works with Special Operations Command SOCOM out of Tampa in Florida.
[00:25:36.361 --> 00:25:39.082]  And he's like, hey man, I saw what you guys were talking about yesterday.
[00:25:39.102 --> 00:25:40.323]  That's a bunch of BS, man.
[00:25:40.823 --> 00:25:41.383]  He's like, you know what?
[00:25:41.403 --> 00:25:42.864]  It's just psychological operations.
[00:25:42.884 --> 00:25:43.665]  Don't worry about it.
[00:25:43.905 --> 00:25:46.086]  Stop pushing your propaganda against our operation.
[00:25:46.686 --> 00:25:46.946]  You know?
[00:25:47.547 --> 00:25:48.787]  We're clearly over the target.
[00:25:49.168 --> 00:25:51.189]  When they come and reach out to me like that,
[00:25:52.109 --> 00:25:54.271]  And I can tell that we've struck a nerve.
[00:25:54.671 --> 00:25:58.634]  You know you're over the target and you're really on to what's going on.
[00:25:58.675 --> 00:26:04.840]  I mean, these guys, I expect more of this coming from SOCOM over the next few days.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:10.344]  Well, I mean, it's like we're bad because we didn't want Al Qaeda to be backed against Assad.
[00:26:10.584 --> 00:26:13.587]  Two years later, we're right and everybody agrees with us, including the Secretary of State.
[00:26:14.908 --> 00:26:17.190]  The military has reached out to us.
[00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:20.772]  They're in the news saying we don't want to be trained to take guns.
[00:26:22.246 --> 00:26:29.571]  They say in all the public documents they're training, this is in Forbes Magazine, for war with the Tea Party with Northcom.
[00:26:29.752 --> 00:26:30.632]  It's treason!
[00:26:31.133 --> 00:26:38.698]  The Tea Party is the most law-abiding group out there, and that's what Texas is listed as an enemy by Southern command.
[00:26:38.718 --> 00:26:39.899]  And they know we can break away.
[00:26:39.919 --> 00:26:42.641]  They have our own resources, we have everything.
[00:26:43.291 --> 00:26:47.273]  And then you have the 1033 program as well, where they're giving all that military equipment to the police forces.
[00:26:47.573 --> 00:26:50.534]  And now this training is going to integrate that with police forces.
[00:26:50.574 --> 00:26:56.637]  They want to work with local law enforcement, they want to move outside of government-owned facilities, and they want to move into the public.
[00:26:57.197 --> 00:27:10.182]  We're not supposed to, quote, counter their PSYOP with, hey, we don't want our military that's absolutely strapped and all over the world and troops having their funding cut and their benefits cut and put on secret death lists.
[00:27:10.642 --> 00:27:11.663]  I love how their operative
[00:27:12.483 --> 00:27:22.713]  Came out and attacked us when you put out an article and linked to the Indianapolis Star saying, you know, they shouldn't make fun of dead veterans, there shouldn't be death lists, and we get called kooks by their, quote, veteran corps.
[00:27:22.993 --> 00:27:23.133]  Yeah.
[00:27:23.233 --> 00:27:25.695]  That's the group there to make sure the vets aren't taken care of.
[00:27:25.716 --> 00:27:26.977]  I mean, this is sick.
[00:27:27.357 --> 00:27:28.158]  This is sick!
[00:27:28.478 --> 00:27:30.080]  Well, what do you want to say to your so-called buddy?
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:34.684]  That I understand that the PSYOP that you're running is not going to work, especially here in Texas.
[00:27:35.024 --> 00:27:41.811]  We're awake, we know what's going on, and we are going to do everything we can to expose what's going on, without a shadow of a doubt.
[00:27:41.971 --> 00:27:42.972]  It's like the twilight zone.
[00:27:42.992 --> 00:27:44.713]  They've got Texas listed as hostile.
[00:27:45.334 --> 00:27:47.796]  They admit their training for a takeover.
[00:27:47.816 --> 00:27:48.897]  We've got all the documents.
[00:27:49.378 --> 00:27:51.059]  They admit it's a PSYOP in the document.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:55.304]  It's like saying we're bad because we get a kid out of a burning house or something.
[00:27:55.404 --> 00:27:57.086]  I just don't understand the mindset.
[00:27:57.747 --> 00:28:02.091]  I mean, well, it's funny though, because he's going, well, stop, you know, stop exposing the PSYOP.
[00:28:02.111 --> 00:28:02.972]  It's just a PSYOP.
[00:28:03.683 --> 00:28:04.703]  Like, that's the whole point.
[00:28:04.723 --> 00:28:05.864]  That's what we're supposed to do, Guy.
[00:28:06.324 --> 00:28:11.585]  We don't want you to condition these people to think it's okay to see military running up and down the streets.
[00:28:11.625 --> 00:28:14.166]  They legalized PSYOPs last year domestically.
[00:28:14.226 --> 00:28:15.346]  Well, that's unconstitutional.
[00:28:15.726 --> 00:28:18.487]  They could legalize taking the guns or legalize having slavery again.
[00:28:19.287 --> 00:28:22.768]  You understand, there's gonna be pushback when you try to occupy the U.S.
[00:28:22.788 --> 00:28:23.968]  We're doing the military a favor.
[00:28:24.148 --> 00:28:25.789]  They want to start a damn civil war!
[00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:29.149]  Get your mind out of the PSYOP!
[00:28:29.229 --> 00:28:30.470]  You're the one under the PSYOP!
[00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:31.290]  What's his first name?
[00:28:32.388 --> 00:28:32.928]  Uh, Dusty.
[00:28:33.409 --> 00:28:34.089]  Hey, Dusty!
[00:28:34.469 --> 00:28:36.190]  You're the one under a PSYOP, buddy!
[00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:40.012]  You don't want to be an old man 30 years from now wishing you'd been on the right side.
[00:28:40.252 --> 00:28:41.652]  I mean, how much more obvious?
[00:28:41.893 --> 00:28:44.674]  Texas isn't the enemy of America!
[00:28:44.994 --> 00:28:47.175]  The globalists are the enemy!
[00:28:47.655 --> 00:28:48.896]  Get it through your head!
[00:28:48.916 --> 00:28:52.538]  You want to tell me what the PSYOP's going to be, Dusty?
[00:28:52.578 --> 00:28:57.200]  It's when the globalists set off a nuke in a major city and blame it on the patriots, and you're forced into a civil war with us.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.121]  You think fighting the Iraqis
[00:29:00.506 --> 00:29:01.046]  What's fun?
[00:29:01.086 --> 00:29:03.368]  Imagine fighting the American people and 10 million vets.
[00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:04.489]  Do you have any idea?
[00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:06.650]  That's about a thousand times worse than the Iraqis.
[00:29:07.011 --> 00:29:08.272]  Does this person have any idea?
[00:29:08.972 --> 00:29:09.653]  Are you an idiot?
[00:29:09.673 --> 00:29:12.274]  You want to say anything else to him, Joe?
[00:29:12.294 --> 00:29:16.057]  I don't want to give him the time of day anymore, to be quite honest.
[00:29:16.397 --> 00:29:19.540]  I already know what we got to do, and we're going to continue to run our operation.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.261]  We're going to continue to expose this crap that's going on.
[00:29:23.182 --> 00:29:24.043]  I'm not going to sit by.
[00:29:24.063 --> 00:29:27.745]  I mean, yeah, I used to be in the military, but I'm still fighting for
[00:29:28.826 --> 00:29:29.326]  America.
[00:29:29.566 --> 00:29:31.747]  And I'm fighting on a more just cause.
[00:29:32.187 --> 00:29:33.087]  A better side now.
[00:29:33.107 --> 00:29:34.928]  You're actually fighting for the republic?
[00:29:35.228 --> 00:29:37.968]  Listed as an enemy with the entire state of Texas and Utah.
[00:29:38.228 --> 00:29:38.949]  What does that tell you?
[00:29:38.969 --> 00:29:39.969]  I want to get the rest of the country.
[00:29:40.289 --> 00:29:42.449]  I guarantee you, I bet Tennessee and others are listed on there.
[00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:44.090]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:45.010]  I'm gonna break down Hillary.
[00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.031]  Says they want to send you to re-education camps.
[00:29:48.351 --> 00:29:49.511]  They already do it at the colleges.
[00:29:49.771 --> 00:29:51.032]  They call it sensitivity training.
[00:29:51.252 --> 00:29:52.672]  She actually calls it fun camps.
[00:29:53.012 --> 00:29:53.972]  Talk about Orwellian.
[00:29:54.232 --> 00:29:56.213]  I'm Alex Jones from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:29:58.718 --> 00:30:01.708]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.651 --> 00:30:05.339]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.606 --> 00:30:15.368]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:30:15.708 --> 00:30:20.009]  Introducing the new InfoWarsLife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[00:30:20.289 --> 00:30:28.012]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[00:30:28.252 --> 00:30:33.473]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:30:33.773 --> 00:30:36.214]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers.
[00:30:36.354 --> 00:30:48.245]  To ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:30:48.605 --> 00:30:54.911]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:30:55.231 --> 00:31:00.136]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:31:00.356 --> 00:31:03.877]  Now available in our limited first run at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:31:04.077 --> 00:31:08.497]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:31:09.238 --> 00:31:17.919]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWarsLife Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[00:31:18.239 --> 00:31:28.201]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[00:31:28.761 --> 00:31:34.863]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:31:35.204 --> 00:31:41.346]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:31:41.586 --> 00:31:46.148]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:31:46.408 --> 00:31:49.770]  The most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[00:31:50.191 --> 00:31:52.972]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:31:53.273 --> 00:31:54.433]  No needles, no injections.
[00:31:54.794 --> 00:31:56.074]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:31:56.195 --> 00:31:57.115]  Try it for yourself.
[00:31:57.395 --> 00:31:58.436]  Discover the secret.
[00:31:58.716 --> 00:31:59.056]  Secret 12.
[00:31:59.817 --> 00:32:01.878]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[00:32:09.722 --> 00:32:10.503]  Alex Jones here.
[00:32:10.683 --> 00:32:19.689]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:32:19.869 --> 00:32:25.173]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.
[00:32:25.453 --> 00:32:33.979]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend, crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge
[00:32:34.079 --> 00:32:38.483]  and prepare your body for what experts admit is the most dangerous season of the year.
[00:32:38.703 --> 00:32:49.893]  We have rejected hundreds of other formulations in our quest to bring you what is simply the most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that we have ever created in the realm of herbal immunity.
[00:32:50.133 --> 00:32:58.120]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.743]  Now is the time to secure ancient defense for you and your family.
[00:33:01.863 --> 00:33:04.465]  Visit Infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:33:04.685 --> 00:33:05.666]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:05.706 --> 00:33:06.907]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:07.087 --> 00:33:26.302]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:33:34.727 --> 00:33:36.168]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:36.208 --> 00:33:36.608]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:36.648 --> 00:33:36.968]  Central.
[00:33:37.008 --> 00:33:37.388]  We're here.
[00:33:38.249 --> 00:33:39.369]  Back Sundays live.
[00:33:39.449 --> 00:33:40.690]  I'll be in studio this Sunday live.
[00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.471]  4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:42.511 --> 00:33:43.451]  Central Standard Time.
[00:33:44.252 --> 00:33:48.414]  Coming to you from the InfoWars News Centers in Austin, Texas.
[00:33:49.675 --> 00:33:59.700]  Just south of me, about 40 miles, 35 miles, will be a giant takeover training maneuver that'll go on for two months in the summer.
[00:34:00.967 --> 00:34:04.910]  The practice taking over the state for the federal government, which itself has been occupied.
[00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:12.636]  This is coup, this is what it looks like, and they've got to get the military in there and start putting Texas up as the enemy on the board.
[00:34:14.777 --> 00:34:19.541]  And then they've got to put out public documents saying we're running a PSYOP to win the hearts and minds of the people locally.
[00:34:20.681 --> 00:34:23.984]  To condition us so that nobody fights back when they actually hit the state.
[00:34:25.316 --> 00:34:28.720]  If you study it, that was done in Panama for about six months before they actually hit him.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.543]  They did constant touch and go drills and declassified that was the plan.
[00:34:33.104 --> 00:34:37.328]  There was a TV show on History Channel about it and narrated by Chuck Heston.
[00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:40.652]  And I've talked to the military.
[00:34:40.752 --> 00:34:42.934]  Now listen, it doesn't mean this is imminent.
[00:34:43.275 --> 00:34:45.277]  They've been pushing this for a long time, but it's
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:35:02.244]  On a scale of 1 to 10, it was about a 1 under Ronald Reagan, about a 2 under George Herbert Walker Bush, about a 7 under Clinton, dialed back to about a 5 under George W., and then now it's about a 9 under Obama.
[00:35:02.324 --> 00:35:07.065]  I mean, they are lined up like the Nazis lined up on the Polish border in 1940.
[00:35:07.105 --> 00:35:07.665]  I mean, it's not good.
[00:35:13.499 --> 00:35:22.906]  And again, I'm not comparing our military to the Nazis, I'm comparing militarily the lining up to what happened in World War II, and they are trying to get the PSYOP going, testing.
[00:35:23.486 --> 00:35:34.494]  Now, it's blown up in Starbucks' face, and Joe Jennings, we were just talking to him a minute ago, he lives in North Austin, he went into one this morning, and they pushed this Race Together sticker on him and gave him the lecture.
[00:35:35.598 --> 00:35:37.659]  And told him to go to the website to be re-educated.
[00:35:37.699 --> 00:35:38.899]  You say, well that's a small thing.
[00:35:38.939 --> 00:35:39.720]  That's the start.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:43.501]  Hillary has come out, because all this goes together like a horse and carriage.
[00:35:44.901 --> 00:35:53.264]  Hillary has come out and said we need fun camps for adults, in which people will be forced to talk to each other about politics, race, the budget, you name it.
[00:35:54.545 --> 00:35:55.725]  That's on NBC News.
[00:35:57.734 --> 00:36:01.695]  See, Americans haven't ever really lived under true totalitarianism, so we're ignorant.
[00:36:02.195 --> 00:36:06.557]  We're like Native Americans who've never been around smallpox, so, you know, it killed 90 plus percent of them.
[00:36:06.737 --> 00:36:11.318]  The European maybe killed 2 percent, because everybody was going to get killed by them, already had generations before.
[00:36:12.079 --> 00:36:20.101]  It's kind of like a dodo bird when they get off on, you know, Easter Island or whatever they were at, and the dodo birds are stupid and fat and juicy and don't run away.
[00:36:20.141 --> 00:36:23.122]  Well, they were all dead in a couple weeks, because the sailors ate them.
[00:36:24.063 --> 00:36:25.123]  No more dodo birds.
[00:36:26.502 --> 00:36:28.122]  So we're kind of like dodo birds.
[00:36:28.623 --> 00:36:32.964]  We were born fighting tyranny 230-something years ago, but we forgot about it.
[00:36:35.544 --> 00:36:38.565]  And compared to other countries, we had a lot of liberty and became the apple of the world's eye.
[00:36:41.286 --> 00:36:43.406]  But we're not ready to deal with it now.
[00:36:43.426 --> 00:36:48.527]  We basically are like domesticated deer that just walk around in front of, you know, the hunters.
[00:36:49.348 --> 00:36:50.528]  And I'm here telling you
[00:36:54.401 --> 00:36:57.503]  From the Texas experience, that's why Texas has this culture.
[00:36:57.864 --> 00:37:15.476]  Utah has a culture of being born out of rebellion more recently, like Texas, and being paranoid of the feds, and being paranoid of being invaded and taken over, because we were always getting invaded by Mexico, or invaded by other countries, or invaded by the feds who wanted it.
[00:37:15.536 --> 00:37:16.517]  I mean, just on and on.
[00:37:16.537 --> 00:37:19.859]  And Texas has that memory.
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:22.321]  And Texas is self-sufficient.
[00:37:23.231 --> 00:37:35.261]  So is a state like Utah, and there's talk in those governments that if the whole country falls into a North American Union, they're going to try to lead a coalition of other states to re-up the Constitutional Republic.
[00:37:35.341 --> 00:37:39.705]  My plan, that we've had constitutional lawyers on, is basically their plan.
[00:37:39.765 --> 00:37:45.530]  Doesn't mean they adopted my plan, it's a common sense plan, that we have a right under the Declaration of Independence to abolish or reform the government.
[00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:46.911]  Well, we don't have a government.
[00:37:46.971 --> 00:37:47.651]  It's been hijacked.
[00:37:47.671 --> 00:37:50.434]  So we kick the hijackers out, re-upload the Republic.
[00:37:51.604 --> 00:37:53.665]  That's my idea for revolution, is restoration.
[00:37:54.585 --> 00:37:57.566]  And I happen to know, Drudge Report leaked to it for like five days a few years ago.
[00:37:57.586 --> 00:37:58.886]  It got picked up in a lot of journals.
[00:37:59.386 --> 00:38:06.448]  A bunch of constitutional lawyers wrote articles about it and said, Mr. Jones's plan comes from the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and it's the plan we should follow.
[00:38:09.069 --> 00:38:14.731]  I came up with a plan to have the cities and counties and states pull out of the Patriot Act, at least at a moral level.
[00:38:15.305 --> 00:38:16.365]  Doesn't mean I'm a great guy.
[00:38:16.425 --> 00:38:17.426]  That plan got put out.
[00:38:18.046 --> 00:38:22.068]  I won the Project Censored Award for the plan and the analysis of the Patriot Act.
[00:38:22.588 --> 00:38:26.590]  And it got put on national television in 800 plus cities and seven or eight states adopted it.
[00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.891]  That's because ideas are bulletproof, folks.
[00:38:30.011 --> 00:38:31.051]  I'm nobody special.
[00:38:31.412 --> 00:38:38.094]  I'm just here repeating, getting past the baton, what people said 240 years ago, what people said in 1836 in Texas.
[00:38:40.796 --> 00:38:47.220]  When David Ayers and William Ayers and my ancestors were here starting the revolution at Washington on the Brazos in East Texas.
[00:38:49.221 --> 00:38:51.843]  Detonating it against the corrupt Santa Ana.
[00:38:52.323 --> 00:38:52.783]  Starting it.
[00:38:53.804 --> 00:38:57.886]  Well now we're not starting it because I am just basically those people continued on.
[00:38:59.307 --> 00:39:06.392]  We're here trying to restore the Republic and we could use Texas and other states as the political
[00:39:07.662 --> 00:39:08.222]  We're good to go.
[00:39:22.833 --> 00:39:25.395]  They've had major confabs at the state level.
[00:39:25.435 --> 00:39:27.376]  They're fully aware of the plan to collapse the country.
[00:39:27.436 --> 00:39:28.757]  Texas doesn't want to collapse.
[00:39:29.098 --> 00:39:32.240]  Texas has developed its own plans to opt out of federal programs.
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.943]  They've been saying no to all the carbon taxes and open borders.
[00:39:36.003 --> 00:39:38.785]  Texas has been quietly securing the border partially.
[00:39:39.926 --> 00:39:42.347]  Texas is not going along with total federalization.
[00:39:44.009 --> 00:39:50.874]  The feds are pouring massive amounts of money into Texas, more than California, who they already captured, to federalize every little city they can.
[00:39:51.786 --> 00:39:53.667]  But they're not getting the counties and the state police.
[00:39:53.728 --> 00:39:56.370]  I mean, folks, this is an all-out war.
[00:39:56.450 --> 00:40:00.093]  You're living in the middle of a 21st century takeover by the corporate board.
[00:40:01.534 --> 00:40:06.457]  And if you just tuned in, feds preparing to invade Texas list state as hostile.
[00:40:06.538 --> 00:40:10.661]  Some participants will be wearing civilian attire and driving civilian vehicles.
[00:40:13.032 --> 00:40:13.972]  And we have the video.
[00:40:14.032 --> 00:40:24.774]  Jade Helm is a challenging eight-week joint military and interagency IAEA unconventional warfare exercise conducted throughout Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado.
[00:40:25.515 --> 00:40:30.816]  According to an unclassified military document announcing the training drill, which runs from July 15th through September 15th.
[00:40:31.896 --> 00:40:32.696]  So for several months.
[00:40:32.776 --> 00:40:36.497]  July, August, September.
[00:40:36.617 --> 00:40:37.237]  Two and a half months.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:39.321]  Multiple branches of the U.S.
[00:40:39.361 --> 00:40:47.549]  military, including Green Beret and Navy SEALs, 82nd Airborne Division, this is an invasion training, will participate in the eight-week-long exercise, which may result in increased aircraft in the area at night.
[00:40:47.909 --> 00:40:56.818]  Troops will be tasked with honing advanced skills in large areas of undeveloped land with low population densities, and will work alongside civilians to gain their trust and understanding of the issues.
[00:40:56.838 --> 00:40:57.358]  You hear that?
[00:40:57.538 --> 00:41:01.362]  Sigh up for cleaning out the countryside, folks.
[00:41:01.482 --> 00:41:01.923]  Get ready.
[00:41:03.049 --> 00:41:09.335]  The exercise in which some participants will be wearing civilian clothes and driving civilian vehicles lists Texas and Utah as hostile territory.
[00:41:12.178 --> 00:41:17.783]  And they've had cases outside Fort Bragg many times where they are playing the part of hostiles.
[00:41:17.803 --> 00:41:21.727]  They're trying to take over a police car and the cop kills them because it was the wrong police car and weren't taking part.
[00:41:22.367 --> 00:41:23.809]  I mean, this could really get bad.
[00:41:23.849 --> 00:41:27.592]  And of course they're arguing, oh, we just picked these as the red-blue force or the
[00:41:28.533 --> 00:41:30.114]  Hostile, friendly force?
[00:41:30.214 --> 00:41:30.394]  No.
[00:41:30.994 --> 00:41:34.395]  Because if you study deeper into this, this is all part of NORTHCOM.
[00:41:35.116 --> 00:41:37.977]  It's all part of the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program.
[00:41:38.437 --> 00:41:40.898]  It's all part of the Brigade Homeland.
[00:41:40.978 --> 00:41:46.400]  It's all part of the National Police Stabilization Force, Federal Police Stabilization Force, the RAND Corporation.
[00:41:47.281 --> 00:41:50.322]  It's all part of this larger program, and I wanted to show you
[00:41:52.159 --> 00:41:54.600]  Some of those articles here.
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.761]  Here's our article from 2011 by Alex Jones and Curt Nemo.
[00:41:58.162 --> 00:42:00.923]  Exclusive, government activating FEMA camps across the U.S.
[00:42:01.323 --> 00:42:06.465]  We show the federal purchase orders, the announcements, the hiring of internment specialists.
[00:42:07.005 --> 00:42:09.326]  I mean, firing up camps for at least 5 million people.
[00:42:10.147 --> 00:42:12.708]  It's all in there linked to FedBizOpps website.
[00:42:12.748 --> 00:42:13.668]  It's all federal government.
[00:42:14.569 --> 00:42:19.691]  Here's congress.gov, HR 390, National Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:26.786]  And these are giant six facilities that can hold millions, and where you will be re-educated, you name it.
[00:42:27.406 --> 00:42:28.547]  And for economic collapse.
[00:42:28.567 --> 00:42:33.732]  Now these are already built, they just wanted to get it statutorily as a new, basically, cabinet branch.
[00:42:33.932 --> 00:42:35.294]  Like Homeland Security under it.
[00:42:38.537 --> 00:42:40.959]  Now, here's another just dovetail of the latest propaganda.
[00:42:40.979 --> 00:42:42.921]  HBO documentary hypes militia threat.
[00:42:42.941 --> 00:42:46.264]  Constitutionalist highlighted in full military regalia as the new enemy.
[00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:55.756]  Pull up Forbes for TV viewers, Pentagon trains to take on Tea Party, Pentagon trains to fight Tea Party rebellion, AP, you name it.
[00:42:56.616 --> 00:42:57.637]  This is what's going on.
[00:43:00.559 --> 00:43:09.186]  But first off, let's talk about the real threat, CNS News, ICE admits 167,527 criminal aliens loose in the U.S.
[00:43:09.246 --> 00:43:10.047]  aggravated felons.
[00:43:10.367 --> 00:43:12.469]  They release thousands every couple days.
[00:43:13.629 --> 00:43:15.210]  That's okay, the border's wide open.
[00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:28.359]  The Border Patrol's ordered to give vouchers to the illegals and bust them into the country, but they're training, and it's in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, to take out, quote, insurrection in the states and by legislatures and governors.
[00:43:29.019 --> 00:43:29.860]  There it is, Forbes.
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:30.701]  Let's put it on screen.
[00:43:31.021 --> 00:43:31.421]  How the U.S.
[00:43:31.461 --> 00:43:33.142]  military would crush a Tea Party rebellion.
[00:43:34.343 --> 00:43:38.046]  And they've got Army War College stuff, even, you know, talking about me and
[00:43:40.175 --> 00:43:42.938]  People like Jones think they're going to hurt our military.
[00:43:43.078 --> 00:43:44.479]  Give me a break.
[00:43:46.421 --> 00:43:54.548]  I have seen this threat coming because I was told by military and by police chiefs who came on the show.
[00:43:55.089 --> 00:43:55.369]  I was 20
[00:43:56.804 --> 00:44:17.630]  Four years old, when I had the Houston Police Connections and the San Antonio Police Chief on, and Thomas Sanchez, the head of emergency management in Kingsville, and the entire county, and I had former Delta Force people on, I had famous Navy SEALs on, they were all retiring then, and they were all being called in and told about the plan by Clinton's people.
[00:44:18.591 --> 00:44:19.611]  And we held that off!
[00:44:20.351 --> 00:44:23.032]  And then people were like, where's the takeover?
[00:44:23.312 --> 00:44:24.313]  When we held it back!
[00:44:24.713 --> 00:44:25.613]  I didn't do anything!
[00:44:26.983 --> 00:44:28.744]  I was 24 when all this kicked off.
[00:44:28.784 --> 00:44:42.191]  I was 22, I'm here 21, but 24 when I was a syndicated show on a few stations, a bunch in Texas, comparatively, and these people knew I knew what I was talking about, so I'd get sent more info, more info, more info, more info.
[00:44:42.431 --> 00:44:52.516]  That's the only reason I'm an expert, because I was told all this by FBI agents, police chiefs, federal marshals, local police, you name it.
[00:44:54.121 --> 00:44:57.322]  That's why I'm an expert, because I was told everything by the experts.
[00:45:00.463 --> 00:45:03.664]  And now they say, oh, Homeland Security's not for Al Qaeda, they're for the Tea Party.
[00:45:03.904 --> 00:45:05.984]  I told you they were going to flip it on the people.
[00:45:07.525 --> 00:45:13.847]  Now, folks know this is happening now, but Hillary Clinton has come out and said, we need camps for adults.
[00:45:14.207 --> 00:45:17.888]  Infowars.com, NBC News, people are like, oh, that'll never happen.
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:22.823]  It is happening, ladies and gentlemen, and it starts with henpecking.
[00:45:23.964 --> 00:45:27.867]  First, the colleges would hand out stickers 20, 30 years ago and say, be aware of race.
[00:45:28.267 --> 00:45:42.478]  And I'm reading from the new Starbucks memo that's now public, that's now mainstream news, race together in social.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.663]  And it goes on to say, make people feel responsible to do their part.
[00:45:48.567 --> 00:45:49.248]  You have guilt.
[00:45:49.488 --> 00:45:50.609]  Do what you're told because you're bad.
[00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:54.594]  We want to foster empathy and common understanding, but only for their agendas.
[00:45:55.015 --> 00:46:03.525]  We help promote awareness and understanding through our efforts with USA Today and other fellow partners and consumers who want to dialogue and share information on this important issue of the country.
[00:46:04.437 --> 00:46:08.302]  This is the civilian fighting force just as big and just as strong as our military.
[00:46:08.582 --> 00:46:17.212]  This is the new recruiting arm of the politically correct henpeckers who will then go out and be spying on all the neighbors under InfraGard watching.
[00:46:17.773 --> 00:46:18.934]  England already has this.
[00:46:18.954 --> 00:46:23.420]  Were you get arrested if you heard making a racial comment in a coffee shop, BBC, seven years ago?
[00:46:27.369 --> 00:46:29.870]  This is where they just get us all fighting with each other.
[00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:31.891]  This is a giant re-education camp.
[00:46:32.331 --> 00:46:36.433]  I said that about 20 times yesterday, but I always said they won't call these FEMA camps.
[00:46:36.933 --> 00:46:39.694]  They'll call them community camps and you don't have a place to live?
[00:46:40.134 --> 00:46:42.155]  We got a 200 square foot little cell for you.
[00:46:42.175 --> 00:46:43.595]  They're building one in downtown Austin.
[00:46:44.036 --> 00:46:45.216]  There is barbed wire around it.
[00:46:45.256 --> 00:46:46.937]  You do go through a checkpoint at biometrics.
[00:46:47.597 --> 00:46:53.941]  There will be police on every floor, but this is where you live, low income, and you work for a factory we have down the street.
[00:46:53.961 --> 00:46:56.482]  We bus you there, but this is your new home.
[00:46:57.063 --> 00:47:08.249]  And then, if you want to have a job outside of here, regular folks have to come to the facility and everyone for tax breaks at first, and it's mandatory as part of your new national service that Rahm Emanuel talked about.
[00:47:08.289 --> 00:47:09.070]  This has all been announced.
[00:47:09.952 --> 00:47:19.256]  If they get away with it, I will be forced, everyone, we'll have to go down and sit and be told about your white privilege and then sit there and watch your five-year-old be taught about transgender.
[00:47:21.277 --> 00:47:22.297]  People are like, oh, that'll never happen.
[00:47:22.317 --> 00:47:24.678]  I told you yesterday they will start calling for camps.
[00:47:24.998 --> 00:47:28.179]  And I told you they'd be called love camps or fun camps.
[00:47:28.399 --> 00:47:29.160]  You can find the clips.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.421]  I said the exact words, fun camps.
[00:47:31.741 --> 00:47:32.621]  Because it's Orwellian.
[00:47:33.422 --> 00:47:34.322]  Everything's inverted.
[00:47:35.848 --> 00:47:43.670]  Here's Hillary, we need fun camps to make people go for their community service or credit to learn how they're bad.
[00:47:44.631 --> 00:47:45.791]  To get fighting with each other.
[00:47:45.811 --> 00:47:46.851]  This is mind control.
[00:47:46.871 --> 00:47:48.912]  This is how you break a country and bring it down.
[00:47:49.172 --> 00:47:51.593]  Let's go to the clip of Hillary.
[00:47:53.514 --> 00:47:56.354]  And then we will get Joe Jennings.
[00:47:56.374 --> 00:48:04.017]  As I have gotten older, I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[00:48:05.814 --> 00:48:09.995]  And we need the kind of camps that you all run.
[00:48:10.155 --> 00:48:11.195]  I mean, really.
[00:48:11.815 --> 00:48:16.676]  Where, you know, none of the serious stuff.
[00:48:17.016 --> 00:48:20.217]  None of the, you know, life-challenging stuff.
[00:48:20.357 --> 00:48:20.957]  More fun.
[00:48:21.017 --> 00:48:25.418]  I think we have a huge fun deficit in America.
[00:48:25.438 --> 00:48:29.419]  And we need to figure out how to fill that fun deficit.
[00:48:29.439 --> 00:48:33.400]  Certainly for our kids, but also for the rest of us.
[00:48:34.659 --> 00:48:46.788]  You know, we need to remind her about my skills from time to time, maybe some enrichment, certainly some time outdoors, maybe actually spending time with people she knows more.
[00:48:48.089 --> 00:48:49.670]  Notice they said fund deficit.
[00:48:50.331 --> 00:48:56.416]  Democrats especially want to be taken care of, so it's an arrested development thing where the government's their mommy or their daddy, and they've said that in studies.
[00:48:57.096 --> 00:49:00.239]  And so they like her up there lecturing like the grandma.
[00:49:01.272 --> 00:49:06.196]  About the fun camps and the fun deficits and what we're going to discuss at these camps.
[00:49:07.797 --> 00:49:09.619]  And the camps are built, but see, they're fun.
[00:49:09.639 --> 00:49:17.605]  There's going to be concerts at them, and there'll be an area to lock up troublemakers, and then there'll be a... This is how you phase them in.
[00:49:18.066 --> 00:49:19.227]  You get free showers.
[00:49:20.007 --> 00:49:21.729]  You get de-louse down the road.
[00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:23.931]  Work makes you free.
[00:49:25.336 --> 00:49:26.798]  We've heard it before.
[00:49:27.439 --> 00:49:30.164]  Joe Jennings, you were in a Starbucks, the one in North Austin.
[00:49:30.184 --> 00:49:31.246]  There's probably 20 of them in town.
[00:49:31.526 --> 00:49:32.908]  Here it is, Race Together.
[00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:35.753]  To get all hyped up and obsessed on race.
[00:49:36.795 --> 00:49:37.736]  Joe, what'd you think of it?
[00:49:38.653 --> 00:49:39.774]  I thought it was kind of interesting.
[00:49:40.415 --> 00:49:44.498]  I sometimes frequent Starbucks, and everyone there is very nice.
[00:49:44.758 --> 00:49:54.125]  But today, I went through the drive-thru, and as I paid for my water and croissant, I was given this sticker.
[00:49:54.345 --> 00:49:55.586]  And I said, what's this sticker?
[00:49:55.847 --> 00:50:01.111]  And he goes, well, look at the website and find out what it's all about.
[00:50:02.403 --> 00:50:11.545]  And again, that's just the beginning of them ninnying and condescending and nudging and pushing, like Cass Sunstein and others said, just pushing us into submission.
[00:50:11.565 --> 00:50:16.286]  It'll cause horrible race relations, just like death education doubled and tripled suicide in schools.
[00:50:17.066 --> 00:50:20.726]  So it's handed something to make me feel guilty about my white privilege?
[00:50:21.066 --> 00:50:22.427]  Is that what it is?
[00:50:23.227 --> 00:50:27.648]  Yeah, and then if you're a quote minority, then the majority in most areas, you're like, oh, your royalty!
[00:50:27.928 --> 00:50:29.228]  We're so sorry for what we've done.
[00:50:30.737 --> 00:50:31.237]  I don't get it.
[00:50:31.697 --> 00:50:33.738]  It just doesn't, it doesn't make any sense.
[00:50:33.778 --> 00:50:35.299]  It's just silly.
[00:50:35.319 --> 00:50:36.199]  Well, it makes perfect sense.
[00:50:36.259 --> 00:50:39.861]  It's the beginning of people coming to your house to have a talk with you.
[00:50:40.501 --> 00:50:41.682]  And your kid's not belonging to you.
[00:50:41.742 --> 00:50:42.762]  I mean, this is all the announcements.
[00:50:42.782 --> 00:50:43.803]  This is totalitarianism.
[00:50:44.063 --> 00:50:44.663]  Yeah, it is.
[00:50:45.763 --> 00:50:46.524]  So what did you say to him?
[00:50:46.944 --> 00:50:49.465]  I said, I said, well, what do you mean I go on the website?
[00:50:49.485 --> 00:50:50.986]  He goes, oh, just go on the website.
[00:50:51.969 --> 00:50:54.211]  You'll find everything out about our new campaign.
[00:50:54.231 --> 00:50:56.533]  I was like, oh, a new campaign, great.
[00:50:56.853 --> 00:51:00.456]  The great race war in America, under the guise of, why's everybody fighting?
[00:51:01.177 --> 00:51:01.797]  We didn't know why.
[00:51:01.817 --> 00:51:07.122]  Because they're just injecting this in the middle of the country, imploding, as the military prepares to take over.
[00:51:07.702 --> 00:51:08.163]  We'll be back.
[00:51:08.183 --> 00:51:09.184]  Thank you, Joe Janich.
[00:51:09.264 --> 00:51:12.028]  This hour of GCN brought to you by Lissig.

[00:51:24.216 --> 00:51:26.159]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.

[00:51:39.608 --> 00:51:40.369]  Hey, Boomer!
[00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:43.930]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:45.631]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[00:51:45.731 --> 00:51:47.472]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[00:51:47.672 --> 00:51:53.175]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[00:51:53.515 --> 00:51:54.255]  I know, right?
[00:51:54.335 --> 00:51:55.296]  You love it, too!
[00:51:55.656 --> 00:51:56.957]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[00:51:57.097 --> 00:51:57.997]  Let's go get some.

[00:52:08.601 --> 00:52:11.163]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:11.443 --> 00:52:16.307]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:16.547 --> 00:52:24.433]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:24.673 --> 00:52:28.997]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:29.197 --> 00:52:33.020]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:38.881]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:39.101 --> 00:52:41.882]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:42.262 --> 00:52:47.483]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:52:47.643 --> 00:52:55.765]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:52:55.825 --> 00:52:56.105]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:52:56.145 --> 00:52:56.625]  Do business

[00:54:37.742 --> 00:54:41.983]  The reason Hitler thought he could beat Russia was he was in an ivory tower in Delusional.
[00:54:43.184 --> 00:54:47.145]  The reason the Soviets thought they could take over the world was because they were in ivory towers in Delusional.
[00:54:48.226 --> 00:54:51.046]  It's the same reason tyrants fall throughout history, they get greedy.
[00:54:53.607 --> 00:54:58.089]  And you have to understand, when you see the propaganda coming out of Washington and out of the think tanks,
[00:54:59.093 --> 00:55:01.875]  And out of California, it makes no sense, it seems ridiculous.
[00:55:02.395 --> 00:55:10.740]  It's targeting people already under its control, who are in suspended disbelief, and who are already captured mentally, and who will do anything they're told.
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:23.909]  You've seen our videos, you've seen Mark Dice's videos, where, in a liberal trendy area, that are actually totalitarian zombie areas, the name liberal means nothing,
[00:55:25.216 --> 00:55:27.596]  They say, yes, put gun owners in forced labor camps.
[00:55:27.896 --> 00:55:29.117]  Let's get the Grathwall clip ready.
[00:55:29.797 --> 00:55:35.578]  Yes, let's, you know, force abort and kill children after they're born.
[00:55:36.458 --> 00:55:39.939]  If you say, let's put children in slave labor for Obama, they say yes.
[00:55:42.979 --> 00:55:46.980]  Because they have no intellect, they have no culture, black, white, old, young, doesn't matter.
[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:48.900]  They just know they're part of a gang.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:53.321]  And so that's why they've got the military training to take on Texas and Utah.
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:56.381]  Enlisting them as hostile force.
[00:55:58.262 --> 00:56:00.763]  Because they know the state governments have said, we're not going along with this.
[00:56:03.024 --> 00:56:09.787]  I mean, Sheriff Arpaio said, I'm going to arrest violent felons that are illegals, and I'm going to give them to ICE.
[00:56:09.847 --> 00:56:15.349]  And so they tried to indict him, and they've SWAT teamed him, and they've sued him, because he follows the law.
[00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:23.073]  They're trying to kick the Travis County Sheriff, who's a black Democrat out, because he deports like five illegals a week, gives them to the feds who are aggravated felons.
[00:56:24.264 --> 00:56:25.304]  I mean, he's not doing enough.
[00:56:25.324 --> 00:56:27.385]  He should deport anybody that comes in there illegally.
[00:56:27.405 --> 00:56:33.366]  But no, if you're a rapist or an arsonist, he'll give you to the feds and the Democrats say, you've got to be unseated.
[00:56:34.567 --> 00:56:35.387]  You're a racist.
[00:56:37.148 --> 00:56:38.188]  You're like, that sounds crazy.
[00:56:38.688 --> 00:56:40.869]  They want everybody to know what we say goes.
[00:56:40.989 --> 00:56:41.629]  We're God.
[00:56:42.709 --> 00:56:44.570]  We'll teach your five-year-olds how to be a tranny.
[00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:48.231]  We'll train the military to take on Texas and confiscate guns.
[00:56:48.911 --> 00:56:51.831]  We'll say we're going to put you in a fun camp to teach you how to be liberal.
[00:56:52.852 --> 00:56:53.452]  We're going to do it.
[00:56:54.633 --> 00:56:55.113]  You understand?
[00:56:55.153 --> 00:56:56.594]  You're in a managed economy now.
[00:56:56.654 --> 00:56:58.055]  You're a slave now.
[00:57:00.017 --> 00:57:04.480]  And so for those of us that this looks crazy to, remember, we weren't broken by them.
[00:57:05.641 --> 00:57:07.902]  But to the zombies, it's like mama's milk.
[00:57:07.962 --> 00:57:11.204]  It's like God speaks when Hillary waddles around up there.
[00:57:11.905 --> 00:57:15.888]  They feel like she's their mommy and they get reflected glory from her.
[00:57:15.968 --> 00:57:17.969]  These are very sad jellyfish creatures.
[00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:21.371]  Now before we go any further,
[00:57:23.032 --> 00:57:25.093]  We were running a special until Thursday.
[00:57:25.233 --> 00:57:28.434]  It was so popular, I've extended it through Sunday.

[00:58:59.375 --> 00:59:00.595]  Another major health threat.
[00:59:00.635 --> 00:59:05.536]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:59:05.616 --> 00:59:08.257]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:59:08.277 --> 00:59:15.058]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:59:15.318 --> 00:59:18.199]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:59:18.299 --> 00:59:21.259]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:59:21.339 --> 00:59:23.259]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:59:23.279 --> 00:59:26.140]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:31.722]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:59:31.942 --> 00:59:35.424]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:59:35.444 --> 00:59:38.425]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:59:38.545 --> 00:59:45.648]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[01:00:21.712 --> 01:00:22.593]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.253 --> 01:00:26.874]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.455 --> 01:00:31.496]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:43.928 --> 01:00:46.489]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're broadcasting worldwide.
[01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:48.030]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:50.051 --> 01:01:02.337]  We have McAfee, the founder of McAfee Antivirus Software, and the guy they tried to frame down in Belize, who told fantastical stories about how it was really Muslim terrorists coming in and that's why they came after him.
[01:01:02.778 --> 01:01:05.479]  Turned out that stuff all came out in the news a year after he said it.
[01:01:06.957 --> 01:01:08.157]  Who is McAvee.com?
[01:01:08.177 --> 01:01:10.178]  He's going to be joining us to cover the waterfront.
[01:01:10.698 --> 01:01:19.179]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the former head of policy at the Treasury, the father of economics, talking about the total police state takeover, the New World Order.
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:27.781]  Western countries, France, Germany, England, Swiss, others, investing in the new Chinese Development Bank globally.
[01:01:28.321 --> 01:01:29.221]  He's going to be joining us.
[01:01:29.301 --> 01:01:31.502]  And are we working on getting Joe Scouser in for 30?
[01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.950]  Yes, sir.
[01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:35.051]  I called and emailed him.
[01:01:35.071 --> 01:01:35.491]  I haven't answered.
[01:01:35.511 --> 01:01:35.751]  Awesome.
[01:01:35.771 --> 01:01:37.051]  Yeah, he's a hard-working fellow.
[01:01:37.191 --> 01:01:40.193]  I just want to get him on, if not Sunday, for a whole hour.
[01:01:40.693 --> 01:01:44.294]  This situation, if you just joined us, InfoWars.com.
[01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:45.915]  It's DrudgeReport.com as well.
[01:01:48.076 --> 01:01:55.138]  The military's training for occupation of the United States and lists Texas and Utah as hostile areas.
[01:01:57.059 --> 01:02:01.961]  And they also list Southern California on the border as hostile, because that's basically controlled by Mexico.
[01:02:03.208 --> 01:02:11.055]  So Texas is listed like a foreign country or foreign occupied area they're trying to retake with the 82nd Airborne and the Navy SEALs and the Delta Force.
[01:02:11.376 --> 01:02:12.697]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:17.521]  I wonder if they'll follow orders.
[01:02:19.063 --> 01:02:26.750]  I think at first they will because there'll be a false flag or a string of them to demonize and everybody will deep down know it's not true but be scared.
[01:02:28.047 --> 01:02:32.951]  See, they say that moral courage is rarer than physical courage.
[01:02:34.452 --> 01:02:37.054]  Saying no to peer pressure is one of the hardest things to do.
[01:02:38.775 --> 01:02:48.903]  But a lot of people who are already out of the military are going to say no to this, and that's why veterans are listed by Homeland Security as the number one enemy, and what Homeland Security is for.
[01:02:50.244 --> 01:02:53.286]  No wonder they put a lot of the vets on no-treat list.
[01:02:54.206 --> 01:02:55.467]  No wonder they don't.
[01:02:56.854 --> 01:03:00.617]  Give you treatment for heart attack or cancer and let you die when you can be helped.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.941]  Another one of our stories is on Infowars.com.
[01:03:06.981 --> 01:03:11.565]  Starbucks baristas refuse to discuss race despite CEO's campaign.
[01:03:12.786 --> 01:03:15.047]  Hashtag race together campaign heading for failure.
[01:03:15.568 --> 01:03:17.149]  Yeah, well they won in a couple places.
[01:03:17.229 --> 01:03:20.191]  Jacari and Kit Daniels did a great job with Hidden Camera.
[01:03:20.211 --> 01:03:22.072]  We're going into a North Austin one right now.
[01:03:22.895 --> 01:03:28.340]  With Anthony Guicciardi and Joe Jennings, where he did have the race campaign thing done this morning.
[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:31.502]  Getting coffee there, getting the croissant there, he said.
[01:03:32.283 --> 01:03:35.385]  And we're going to go in there with cameras openly and explain to them what this is really all about.
[01:03:35.646 --> 01:03:37.847]  But that is on DrudgeReport.com right now.
[01:03:38.268 --> 01:03:39.509]  Are we triple linked on Drudge?
[01:03:39.529 --> 01:03:40.630]  I haven't had triple link in a while.
[01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:41.070]  That's awesome.
[01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:41.931]  I think it is triple link.
[01:03:41.951 --> 01:03:44.113]  Yeah, because we've got the Camille Paglia article.
[01:03:44.733 --> 01:03:45.894]  That's excellent, and video.
[01:03:45.914 --> 01:03:48.958]  We've got Feds Preparing to Invade Texas listed as a hostile article.
[01:03:49.399 --> 01:03:50.500]  And we've got that one on there as well.
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.342]  That's my journalist, my researchers.
[01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:53.463]  We've got a hard-hitting team.
[01:03:54.605 --> 01:03:56.006]  I've sat back and thought, who's the best?
[01:03:56.026 --> 01:04:00.191]  Sha'Carri Jackson, LeeAnn McAdoo, Don Salazar, Curt Nemo.
[01:04:01.587 --> 01:04:25.261]  You know, Rob Dew, John Bowne, I mean all of them, Rob Jacobson, I really can't say of our researchers, editors, journalists, David Knight, Josh Owens, I mean just everybody, the crew in here, I really can't tell you who is the best, they're all just really get what's going on, they're out there engaging in real journalism, testing things, showing things, demonstrating things.
[01:04:25.941 --> 01:04:29.043]  It's beyond journalism, it's beyond gonzo too, it's just we're living it.
[01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:31.305]  We're going out and checking everything.
[01:04:31.345 --> 01:04:32.326]  We're verifying stuff.
[01:04:32.346 --> 01:04:34.107]  We're reality-testing things.
[01:04:34.167 --> 01:04:48.419]  We're looking at it from a common-sense historical lens and just wearing our open bias of telling the truth and loving freedom and being absolutely fiery-blooded liberty lovers that are ready to do whatever it takes, never submit, never back down, never give up.
[01:04:48.759 --> 01:04:50.761]  And our morale and motivation has never been higher.
[01:04:51.241 --> 01:04:52.002]  It's called Americana.
[01:04:52.402 --> 01:04:53.283]  It's called Renaissance.
[01:04:53.303 --> 01:04:53.783]  It's called 1776.
[01:04:53.963 --> 01:04:56.205]  It's called the spirit of liberty.
[01:04:56.886 --> 01:04:58.167]  And it's infectious in a good way.
[01:04:58.868 --> 01:05:03.861]  I want to encourage all of you in the system, corporate, government, private, you name it, to join us now.
[01:05:04.583 --> 01:05:06.548]  Be part of the good guys and come in for the big win.
[01:05:06.789 --> 01:05:07.150]  Stay with us.
[01:05:09.124 --> 01:05:10.045]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:05:10.085 --> 01:05:10.525]  Good, brother.
[01:05:10.665 --> 01:05:12.327]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:05:12.387 --> 01:05:14.169]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:05:14.329 --> 01:05:18.333]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:05:18.353 --> 01:05:20.935]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:05:20.975 --> 01:05:23.217]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:05:23.397 --> 01:05:31.365]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:05:31.585 --> 01:05:34.690]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:36.332]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:05:36.352 --> 01:05:39.257]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:05:39.277 --> 01:05:40.779]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:05:41.039 --> 01:05:46.848]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[01:05:47.128 --> 01:05:48.729]  Or maximum potency.
[01:05:48.890 --> 01:05:55.055]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience.
[01:05:55.355 --> 01:05:59.038]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[01:05:59.098 --> 01:06:00.840]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:07.826]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:06:08.993 --> 01:06:12.216]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:06:12.516 --> 01:06:20.523]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:06:20.763 --> 01:06:25.767]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:07:08.837 --> 01:07:18.364]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:07:18.504 --> 01:07:28.251]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:07:28.431 --> 01:07:31.353]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:07:31.553 --> 01:07:34.395]  And contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients.
[01:07:34.595 --> 01:07:38.677]  Often times full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[01:07:38.797 --> 01:07:43.199]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[01:07:43.459 --> 01:07:45.741]  Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[01:07:45.901 --> 01:07:48.142]  And there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.
[01:07:48.442 --> 01:07:53.908]  Instead, Oxy-Powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[01:07:54.128 --> 01:07:59.353]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[01:07:59.474 --> 01:08:05.440]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with Oxy-Powder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:08:12.054 --> 01:08:18.058]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:18.678 --> 01:08:21.660]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:44.266 --> 01:08:45.806]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[01:08:45.886 --> 01:08:48.927]  Thank you so much for joining us into this second hour.
[01:08:48.947 --> 01:08:53.729]  If you just tuned in, Feds are preparing to invade Texas.
[01:08:53.809 --> 01:08:55.049]  This state is hostile.
[01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:59.130]  Some participants will be wearing civilian attire during civilian activities.
[01:08:59.710 --> 01:09:05.452]  It's taking place in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 states.
[01:09:06.072 --> 01:09:12.374]  And out of those 7 states, only Texas and Utah are listed as hostile.
[01:09:14.966 --> 01:09:17.928]  You cannot make this type of stuff up.
[01:09:19.289 --> 01:09:26.293]  And that ties into the fact they say they're trying to gain the trust of civilians and understanding of the issues.
[01:09:26.553 --> 01:09:28.975]  This is all to condition the public.
[01:09:29.515 --> 01:09:30.615]  It ties into H.R.
[01:09:30.856 --> 01:09:33.477]  390, the National Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[01:09:34.718 --> 01:09:39.801]  It ties into Hillary Clinton coming out and saying, we need to have re-education camps.
[01:09:39.821 --> 01:09:44.184]  I want to play the Grothschild clip in a minute, the Green Beret that infiltrated the Weatherman.
[01:09:45.225 --> 01:09:51.583]  They were then convicted and their plan to take over America basically using racial division and then put
[01:09:52.901 --> 01:09:55.984]  Tens of millions of Americans in re-education camps and kill half of them.
[01:09:56.884 --> 01:09:58.526]  Because Hillary is now talking about that.
[01:09:58.546 --> 01:10:00.267]  And this Starbucks thing is the beginning of that.
[01:10:00.688 --> 01:10:05.112]  Handing you race relation stickers to henpeck you and create all this angst.
[01:10:05.632 --> 01:10:13.058]  And then the quote minority side and the pro-politically correct side of quote whites all joined together.
[01:10:13.078 --> 01:10:16.722]  This is serious, agiprop-type garbage.
[01:10:17.657 --> 01:10:19.078]  This is an admitted battle plan.
[01:10:19.098 --> 01:10:20.359]  Soros has been caught funding it.
[01:10:21.459 --> 01:10:23.821]  They're turning up the heat in every major TV show.
[01:10:23.861 --> 01:10:29.524]  They are really, really coming at the states and the cities as the feds come in and demonize local police.
[01:10:29.805 --> 01:10:30.965]  They want to come in as the saviors.
[01:10:30.985 --> 01:10:41.452]  We're going to talk to John McAfee of, of course, McAfee Software and so much more about this and the waterfront in a moment and his fight for privacy and something new and very exciting he's launched.
[01:10:42.438 --> 01:10:52.441]  But let's play that clip of Larry Grafwald and then we will play the clip again of Hillary saying, it's going to be fun!
[01:10:52.921 --> 01:10:57.083]  We need fun camps to make people discuss race and all this garbage.
[01:10:57.763 --> 01:11:06.405]  So this is their mind control operations where they tell us what to think, what to eat, and as Michelle Obama said, not to be bossy, because she's not bossy being bossy.
[01:11:06.806 --> 01:11:07.826]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[01:11:08.917 --> 01:11:18.845]  And they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest.
[01:11:21.307 --> 01:11:27.592]  Where we would take all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them.
[01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:30.431]  How things were going to be.
[01:11:31.332 --> 01:11:34.934]  I asked, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate?
[01:11:34.954 --> 01:11:37.676]  That are die-hard capitalists.
[01:11:38.777 --> 01:11:41.439]  And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:50.646]  And when I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[01:11:51.287 --> 01:11:52.988]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:55.217]  25 million people.
[01:11:56.138 --> 01:12:17.397]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people, most of which have graduate degrees from Columbia and other well-known educational centers, and hear them figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people.
[01:12:17.817 --> 01:12:19.538]  And they were dead serious.
[01:12:20.799 --> 01:12:22.919]  From 1982, the documentary, No Place to Hide.
[01:12:23.359 --> 01:12:25.320]  Larry Grathwald, a great patriot, died last year.
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.260]  Frequent guest on the show.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:39.122]  Notice they say, for the re-education of Texas and Utah when they're taken down, this is just a training mission for that, the joint forces, New Mexico is the central base, the southwest, where we'll be re-educated.
[01:12:39.982 --> 01:12:41.423]  Right there in the new official documents.
[01:12:42.683 --> 01:12:43.083]  Isn't that cute?
[01:12:44.563 --> 01:12:47.924]  It's their common base, says right here.
[01:12:50.447 --> 01:12:51.228]  So there you go.
[01:12:51.528 --> 01:12:55.771]  I guess they round us up, bring us to these sub-bases, fly us into these bases.
[01:12:55.791 --> 01:12:57.132]  They'll be practicing drilling that.
[01:12:58.032 --> 01:12:59.293]  Practicing taking over the Capitol.
[01:12:59.734 --> 01:13:01.835]  Practice hunting down ranchers and farmers.
[01:13:01.875 --> 01:13:03.096]  They admit that's all in the drills.
[01:13:03.556 --> 01:13:07.139]  Then they'll, for the media, have some Iraq or Afghanistan training for the public.
[01:13:07.459 --> 01:13:11.001]  And they admit it's all a psy-op to win our hearts and minds to condition us for occupation.
[01:13:12.442 --> 01:13:14.404]  We are joined by John McAfee.
[01:13:16.093 --> 01:13:18.855]  And he's going to launch a big new privacy push here today.
[01:13:18.875 --> 01:13:19.975]  We're very excited about that.
[01:13:20.015 --> 01:13:21.456]  Who is McAvee.com?
[01:13:22.476 --> 01:13:24.357]  FutureTentCentral.com.
[01:13:24.718 --> 01:13:27.619]  And we'll talk some about his new platform and program, but I want to pick his brain.
[01:13:28.259 --> 01:13:39.345]  He gets demonized in the media because he's an eccentric fella, sold his company for hundreds of millions of dollars, moved down to Belize, said that he was run out of the country by terrorists, by people connected to Islamists.
[01:13:39.385 --> 01:13:42.087]  Turned out that for a year after he left, that did come out in mainstream news.
[01:13:42.627 --> 01:13:43.788]  He successfully evaded
[01:13:44.808 --> 01:13:46.288]  The authorities got into Guatemala.
[01:13:46.308 --> 01:13:48.949]  I've talked to people that still think he's in jail or something.
[01:13:48.969 --> 01:13:49.549]  He never was.
[01:13:50.429 --> 01:13:53.490]  He was able to hack into the government computers, record them, involve them in this stuff.
[01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:56.250]  He's quite the survivor, quite the adventurer.
[01:13:56.950 --> 01:14:00.171]  And John McAfee joins us here on the Global Transmission.
[01:14:00.711 --> 01:14:10.533]  John, you heard me just get into the preparation for the collapse in Utah and Texas, targeted for NorthCom takeover by SouthCom.
[01:14:11.353 --> 01:14:12.433]  What do you make of all this?
[01:14:14.417 --> 01:14:22.439]  You know, I think the world is going to hell in a handbasket in a number of ways, Alex.
[01:14:23.679 --> 01:14:30.441]  The problem stems from a removal of our basic freedoms, our liberties, our privacies.
[01:14:30.561 --> 01:14:38.583]  We have people telling us how to think, what to say, what to believe.
[01:14:39.746 --> 01:14:41.367]  We have people watching what we say.
[01:14:41.428 --> 01:14:43.209]  We have people watching what we do.
[01:14:43.889 --> 01:14:45.931]  Pretty soon we'll have people watching what we think.
[01:14:48.012 --> 01:14:56.598]  It's a tragic state of affairs and nothing in the news that I've seen in the past month has elevated me.
[01:14:56.618 --> 01:14:58.019]  It has all depressed me.
[01:15:00.336 --> 01:15:10.185]  Well, I agree with you and we've got open NSA spying illegally, we've got Congress openly being blackmailed, we've got the borders ordered completely wide open outside of law.
[01:15:10.265 --> 01:15:11.866]  I mean, we have become a tyranny.
[01:15:12.286 --> 01:15:14.428]  My only question is, where are we going next?
[01:15:14.508 --> 01:15:16.010]  I think the bottom has fallen out.
[01:15:16.570 --> 01:15:18.452]  So now, how deep is this chasm?
[01:15:20.333 --> 01:15:22.816]  I think that the chasm is far deeper than we thought.
[01:15:23.416 --> 01:15:24.117]  If you remember,
[01:15:25.064 --> 01:15:35.868]  One year ago, almost to the day, I was on your show railing about a company called Harris Corporation and a device that they had created called a Stingray.
[01:15:36.708 --> 01:15:46.812]  And how they had created a contract that would not allow the purchaser of one of these devices to divulge to anyone that they owned it.
[01:15:47.272 --> 01:15:53.115]  In other words, you could not divulge the name of the device, the name of the purchaser, anything.
[01:15:53.135 --> 01:15:53.955]  And I'm going,
[01:15:54.457 --> 01:15:55.398]  This is insane.
[01:15:55.738 --> 01:15:56.919]  It's utterly insane.
[01:15:57.359 --> 01:16:05.205]  The reason for it, of course, is Harris Court does not want the world to know how many of these devices are out there, because I'm afraid it's in the millions.
[01:16:05.805 --> 01:16:13.791]  And these devices are used, ostensibly, to catch terrorists or criminals doing nefarious things.
[01:16:14.031 --> 01:16:17.713]  Have investigators without warrants sit there and listen to your phone calls, everything.
[01:16:17.753 --> 01:16:18.294]  It's unbelievable.
[01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:20.592]  But here's the problem, Alex.
[01:16:20.652 --> 01:16:23.596]  It's not just listening to the phone call of the target.
[01:16:23.996 --> 01:16:29.263]  It's listening to everybody's phone call within the quarter mile radius of where this device is located.
[01:16:29.664 --> 01:16:31.366]  Because they're all connecting up to you.
[01:16:31.927 --> 01:16:35.692]  Now, the police and the FBI and the authorities say...
[01:16:37.633 --> 01:16:38.633]  We're not caring about that.
[01:16:38.673 --> 01:16:40.234]  We're filtering out all of that.
[01:16:40.454 --> 01:16:42.515]  Well, how do you filter it out unless you listen to it?
[01:16:42.795 --> 01:16:43.336]  Think about it.
[01:16:43.356 --> 01:16:58.163]  I mean, you're looking for one conversation amongst... And let's remember just six months ago when you and others were beating the drum and we were beating the drum to expose it, we exposed other big secret networks, became national news in Seattle and other areas the Homeland Security was putting in, you know, not just local police.
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:01.043]  They came out and said, those aren't ours.
[01:17:01.143 --> 01:17:02.165]  We don't know whose they are.
[01:17:02.446 --> 01:17:03.608]  They lied to the public.
[01:17:03.648 --> 01:17:04.489]  The FBI did.
[01:17:05.010 --> 01:17:05.932]  So there's also that.
[01:17:05.952 --> 01:17:06.914]  I mean, this is illegal.
[01:17:08.047 --> 01:17:08.848]  Of course it's illegal.
[01:17:08.888 --> 01:17:16.393]  I think the contract itself is illegal because it violates our freedom of access to public information.
[01:17:17.674 --> 01:17:25.900]  We have a law passed by Congress that gives us the right to find out what the hell our government is doing, our local government, our state government.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:31.924]  And now Obama announced three days ago they will no longer honor FOIA requests, period, at the White House outside of law.
[01:17:32.344 --> 01:17:35.286]  So is it a bottomless chasm?
[01:17:35.406 --> 01:17:36.187]  I mean, how deep is it?
[01:17:37.233 --> 01:17:43.975]  Well, I think it shows some degree of indifference and stupidity on the part of the average American, Alex.
[01:17:43.995 --> 01:17:46.415]  Listen, here's how it finally came to light.
[01:17:46.455 --> 01:17:50.136]  Now, I talked about it two years ago and said, this is going to be a problem.
[01:17:50.597 --> 01:17:52.117]  This is insane.
[01:17:52.577 --> 01:17:54.638]  It has to be addressed and looked at.
[01:17:55.098 --> 01:17:55.738]  So finally,
[01:17:56.571 --> 01:17:59.832]  It takes something dramatic for anyone to ever take notice.
[01:18:00.332 --> 01:18:12.354]  The Sheriff of Santa Clara County, a woman, put in a request for half a million dollars for these machines that were able to tap telephones of bad people.
[01:18:13.054 --> 01:18:19.616]  So, this is the first time that they had done a referendum to get public money.
[01:18:19.676 --> 01:18:20.356]  Without the warrant?
[01:18:21.021 --> 01:18:24.042]  Before this, though, the public started asking questions like, well, what is it?
[01:18:24.482 --> 01:18:25.723]  Well, we can't tell you what it is.
[01:18:25.743 --> 01:18:27.263]  Well, what does it do?
[01:18:27.423 --> 01:18:28.604]  We can't tell you what it does.
[01:18:29.264 --> 01:18:30.665]  Can we see a demonstration?
[01:18:30.925 --> 01:18:31.705]  No, you can't.
[01:18:32.165 --> 01:18:34.066]  Can you tell us the name of the product?
[01:18:34.426 --> 01:18:35.286]  No, we cannot.
[01:18:35.706 --> 01:18:37.967]  Can you tell us who made it?
[01:18:38.427 --> 01:18:39.408]  No, we can't.
[01:18:39.888 --> 01:18:41.569]  Do you see the insanity?
[01:18:41.969 --> 01:18:50.072]  This is actually happening in America, in Santa Clara, California, as we speak, and probably in thousands of other cities across this country.
[01:18:50.825 --> 01:19:11.721]  Because all the police, all the FBI, all the agencies, they want these Stingray devices because they allow you to listen to anyone's telephone conversations and to plant software in those telephones that will monitor your every word, view everything that you do while you're showering, while you're in the bathroom, while you're... Get your codes!
[01:19:12.661 --> 01:19:13.062]  I'm sorry?
[01:19:13.462 --> 01:19:19.987]  Get your other passcodes and imagine this is all being done illegally without a warrant, just in our face.
[01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.710]  That's correct.
[01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:23.672]  That's absolutely correct.
[01:19:24.033 --> 01:19:35.087]  Judges do not even understand what they say when we're going to use our unnameable device to listen to this man's conversation.
[01:19:35.387 --> 01:19:38.912]  What it really does is it listens to everyone's conversation within
[01:19:39.572 --> 01:19:42.393]  The pickup radius of that Moho device.
[01:19:42.453 --> 01:19:44.093]  It intercepts it and de-scrambles it.
[01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:45.133]  It steals it.
[01:19:45.813 --> 01:19:48.454]  And then someone is leaking to your computer.
[01:19:48.574 --> 01:19:50.554]  Well, I tell you what, stay there.
[01:19:50.614 --> 01:19:51.794]  Your Skype's breaking up a bit.
[01:19:51.834 --> 01:19:53.774]  John McAvee is our guest.
[01:19:53.814 --> 01:19:55.515]  He was McAvee.com.
[01:19:55.575 --> 01:19:57.055]  FutureTentCentral.com.
[01:19:57.355 --> 01:19:59.635]  He's got a way to counter this.
[01:19:59.695 --> 01:20:03.476]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a criminal revolution against society.
[01:20:04.036 --> 01:20:08.017]  We'll also look at a Forbes investigation of the DEA and their criminal activities.
[01:20:09.125 --> 01:20:15.927]  By now you know that wireless technology, like cell phones, do in fact pose dangers to the health and privacy of everyone.

[01:21:06.452 --> 01:21:11.697]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:21:12.498 --> 01:21:12.999]  It's true.
[01:21:13.119 --> 01:21:17.082]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:21:17.282 --> 01:21:19.163]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:21:19.664 --> 01:21:24.167]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:21:24.467 --> 01:21:31.813]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA.
[01:21:32.153 --> 01:21:37.058]  Pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[01:21:37.318 --> 01:21:40.862]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[01:21:41.122 --> 01:21:43.425]  The gold standard in water purification.

[01:21:48.089 --> 01:21:52.374]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[01:22:07.819 --> 01:22:08.719]  Alex Jones here.
[01:22:08.799 --> 01:22:17.803]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:22:17.983 --> 01:22:23.185]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.

[01:23:37.421 --> 01:23:40.003]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[01:23:40.143 --> 01:23:44.145]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[01:23:44.446 --> 01:23:45.686]  SilverLungs.com.
[01:23:45.847 --> 01:23:48.328]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[01:23:48.528 --> 01:23:51.310]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:53.651]  The Silver Lungs Generator allows you to make your own.
[01:23:53.872 --> 01:23:55.633]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[01:23:55.773 --> 01:24:01.096]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[01:24:01.336 --> 01:24:05.019]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and lung delivery system at SilverLungs.com.
[01:24:05.139 --> 01:24:06.640]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[01:24:11.305 --> 01:24:12.857]  Look like an angel.
[01:24:16.895 --> 01:24:19.036]  Under Bush, we criticized his corrupt policies.
[01:24:19.096 --> 01:24:21.358]  It was called the highest form of patriotism.
[01:24:22.158 --> 01:24:23.879]  Dissent, the highest form of patriotism.
[01:24:24.359 --> 01:24:25.900]  Under Obama, it's called racism.
[01:24:26.581 --> 01:24:31.383]  Charlie Sheen put out a tweet saying, why was Obama cutting funding to veterans groups?
[01:24:31.764 --> 01:24:36.126]  He called him Barry Kenyan Sotaro, you know, pointing out that he might have been born in Kenya.
[01:24:36.286 --> 01:24:39.328]  And Newsweek, you name it, called him racist.
[01:24:39.368 --> 01:24:44.091]  But Obama made the same joke the week before at a press dinner, saying, well, I'm from
[01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:48.032]  Kenya and I moved here because I love America so much.
[01:24:49.914 --> 01:24:52.576]  So again, they know it's not racist.
[01:24:52.676 --> 01:24:55.638]  It's their political weapon to bully people into submission.
[01:24:55.978 --> 01:25:02.123]  And while all of our rights are being stolen, while we're being signed on to tens of trillions more in fake derivatives of foreign banks,
[01:25:03.291 --> 01:25:06.353]  While our basic freedoms are being dismantled, they're obsessing on race.
[01:25:06.393 --> 01:25:13.118]  I want to get into your ways of countering this in the next longer segment, John McAvee, who joins us from whoismcavee.com.
[01:25:13.678 --> 01:25:16.621]  But what do you make of the obsessing on race suddenly?
[01:25:16.681 --> 01:25:22.044]  And George Soros caught funding 30 plus million dollars to stir up demonstrations against the police.
[01:25:22.505 --> 01:25:30.030]  I mean, I know we're both against the police being organs of tyranny, but we, I mean, I know I understand they're trying to cause balkanization.
[01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:31.151]  What do you think's going on here?
[01:25:32.619 --> 01:25:37.082]  Well, as you know, Alex, my wife is black.
[01:25:38.243 --> 01:25:50.653]  And I am extremely familiar with all of the racial issues involved with both white, black people and others.
[01:25:50.953 --> 01:25:55.477]  I think we are beyond needing the government to be involved.
[01:25:56.364 --> 01:26:13.638]  In our opinions and attitudes toward race, just like we do not need the government involved in our opinions and attitudes toward church, belief, political affiliation, spiritual aspirations or anything else.
[01:26:13.718 --> 01:26:14.119]  Exactly!
[01:26:15.712 --> 01:26:19.394]  So this is the fundamental problem.
[01:26:20.215 --> 01:26:21.116]  The real problem is this.
[01:26:21.436 --> 01:26:27.501]  The government wants to be our parents, our father.
[01:26:27.521 --> 01:26:32.244]  They want to take care of us like you would take care of a wayward child.
[01:26:32.765 --> 01:26:37.268]  Homeland Security promised us after 9-11 we would be secure.
[01:26:37.768 --> 01:26:42.132]  All we had to do was give up a whole bunch of freedoms and we would be secure.
[01:26:42.848 --> 01:26:43.811]  People bought into that.
[01:26:44.212 --> 01:26:45.175]  How secure are we?
[01:26:45.496 --> 01:26:47.401]  Far less now than we were before.
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:55.042]  And we have given up a great deal of freedom and a great deal of privacy for this illusion of security.
[01:26:55.542 --> 01:26:56.943]  There is no such thing as security.
[01:26:57.743 --> 01:26:59.723]  At least not provided by the government.
[01:27:00.043 --> 01:27:02.184]  How can they provide security for me?
[01:27:02.744 --> 01:27:12.967]  If a burglar breaks into my house, is there a magic button that I can push that will make the police materialize instantly between myself and the burglar?
[01:27:13.107 --> 01:27:13.287]  No.
[01:27:13.707 --> 01:27:15.428]  The police do not prevent crimes.
[01:27:16.232 --> 01:27:19.517]  They are there after the fact to help solve the crime.
[01:27:19.537 --> 01:27:23.704]  And then they don't know who's who when they come into a situation and make a lot of mistakes.
[01:27:23.744 --> 01:27:24.625]  We're not even blaming them.
[01:27:24.665 --> 01:27:27.469]  It's just that they're not even a panacea when there is a cop there.
[01:27:28.322 --> 01:27:36.285]  Well, I just don't think that anybody can take responsibility for your own security other than yourself, Alex.
[01:27:36.465 --> 01:27:41.347]  When you buy a house, do you call the Department of the Interior and say, please install my locks?
[01:27:41.727 --> 01:27:41.907]  No.
[01:27:42.147 --> 01:27:42.808]  That's your job.
[01:27:43.228 --> 01:27:43.928]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:44.088 --> 01:27:46.329]  Do you call the government and say, give me free insurance?
[01:27:46.369 --> 01:27:48.190]  But that's the mindset they're selling.
[01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.931]  Well, of course.
[01:27:50.591 --> 01:27:53.332]  Because that buys votes, does it?
[01:27:53.945 --> 01:27:55.366]  I mean, think about it.
[01:27:55.646 --> 01:28:01.449]  You have someone saying, we're going to give you everything, we're going to protect you, we're going to keep you safe, we're going to keep you healthy.
[01:28:01.469 --> 01:28:07.772]  All you've got to do is give up control to us because we know better.
[01:28:07.912 --> 01:28:12.955]  You're a famous engineer, a famous entrepreneur, a famous programmer, worked in NASA and secret programs.
[01:28:13.255 --> 01:28:14.176]  You've been around the block.
[01:28:15.557 --> 01:28:22.806]  You had that famous escape from a police, were vindicated there that they were involved in serious criminal operations, clearly.
[01:28:23.407 --> 01:28:25.690]  Where do you see it all going?
[01:28:25.730 --> 01:28:27.092]  I mean, do you have hope for humanity?
[01:28:27.472 --> 01:28:28.594]  Where do you see it all ending?
[01:28:30.735 --> 01:28:37.719]  I think the first thing, Alex, is we have to take responsibility for our own actions, our own thoughts, our own feelings.
[01:28:38.079 --> 01:28:39.920]  This is not happening in America anymore.
[01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:54.367]  What we want is other people, our boss, our landlord, our wife, our spouse, the state, the county, the city, the federal government to take care of us and make our decisions for us.
[01:28:54.767 --> 01:28:57.129]  This is the tragedy that exists today.
[01:28:58.309 --> 01:28:59.410]  This cannot continue.
[01:29:00.063 --> 01:29:08.766]  You cannot live a free, meaningful existence if you abdicate responsibility for yourself.
[01:29:08.866 --> 01:29:09.706]  And we have done that.
[01:29:09.986 --> 01:29:11.567]  We've done that because we're lazy.
[01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:14.487]  We have our smartphones here.
[01:29:14.948 --> 01:29:15.768]  We all have one.
[01:29:16.268 --> 01:29:17.688]  Because they make life easier.
[01:29:17.748 --> 01:29:23.110]  They make access to our friends extremely quick, simple.
[01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:26.031]  We no longer have to remember telephone numbers.
[01:29:26.937 --> 01:29:29.418]  They, uh, they have access to the internet.
[01:29:29.438 --> 01:29:33.980]  They make life so easy that we have become lazy.
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:38.202]  And with that we lose our humanity and our IQ and everything else.
[01:29:38.242 --> 01:29:41.723]  John McAvee, whoismcavey.com, excellent website, future10central.com.
[01:29:41.743 --> 01:29:50.047]  We're going to tell you about something he's developed that's revolutionary, very exciting to counter all this spying, and it's stuff like this that is really going to
[01:29:50.467 --> 01:29:53.028]  Put a fly in the ointment of Big Brother.

[01:30:18.307 --> 01:30:28.291]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[01:30:28.851 --> 01:30:34.933]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:30:35.273 --> 01:30:36.934]  Secret 12 is a binary
[01:30:36.954 --> 01:30:39.055]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:30:39.075 --> 01:30:40.315]  No needles, no injections.
[01:30:40.375 --> 01:30:41.636]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:30:41.656 --> 01:30:42.176]  Try it for yourself.
[01:30:42.196 --> 01:30:43.117]  Discover the secret.
[01:30:43.297 --> 01:30:43.477]  Secret 12.

[01:31:48.602 --> 01:31:54.907]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[01:31:55.208 --> 01:32:00.212]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[01:32:00.372 --> 01:32:03.935]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.

[01:32:09.502 --> 01:32:13.003]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:32:13.163 --> 01:32:17.125]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:32:17.445 --> 01:32:18.905]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:32:19.225 --> 01:32:26.808]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:32:27.068 --> 01:32:27.928]  But for how long?
[01:32:28.209 --> 01:32:34.471]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:32:34.851 --> 01:32:37.672]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:32:39.093 --> 01:32:42.315]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:32:42.615 --> 01:32:50.619]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:32:50.859 --> 01:32:55.882]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:32:56.282 --> 01:32:58.563]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:32:58.803 --> 01:33:00.584]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:33:13.644 --> 01:33:19.893]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.456 --> 01:33:39.600]  You are being watched.
[01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:41.241]  You are being tracked.
[01:33:41.301 --> 01:33:41.841]  It's illegal.
[01:33:42.581 --> 01:33:46.982]  The globalists call it espionage if you try to track what they're doing.
[01:33:47.483 --> 01:33:51.504]  We're supposed to have transparency in government, privacy in our individual lives.
[01:33:52.384 --> 01:33:53.925]  But now we have the inverse of that.
[01:33:56.025 --> 01:34:00.487]  The pentacle, the symbol of the star, is just a symbol of human power.
[01:34:02.647 --> 01:34:06.548]  The head, the two arms, the two legs, you invert that, the pentagram is anti-human.
[01:34:07.249 --> 01:34:08.129]  It's upside down.
[01:34:08.729 --> 01:34:09.809]  It's inverted.
[01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:21.233]  And we have a system not based on renaissance and empowerment of the human spirit, true liberalism, in the Thomas Jeffersonian vein, we have the satanic inverse of that.
[01:34:22.625 --> 01:34:25.186]  And I'm sick of it, and the New World Order will fall.
[01:34:26.206 --> 01:34:28.366]  Up on DrudgeReport.com, look at these headlines.
[01:34:31.807 --> 01:34:39.128]  Federal workers told to, this is so incredible, probe their unconscious bias.
[01:34:39.848 --> 01:34:42.609]  Now we're looking for unconscious bias.
[01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:47.450]  Unconscious bias.
[01:34:48.945 --> 01:34:52.550]  Not the conscious mega-banks raping the country, more derivatives.
[01:34:52.850 --> 01:34:54.893]  They've just announced more banker bailouts coming.
[01:34:54.913 --> 01:34:56.435]  No, no, no.
[01:34:56.475 --> 01:34:58.978]  We're just all supposed to start fighting with each other and divide and conquer.
[01:34:59.319 --> 01:35:01.862]  John McAfee is our guest when he leaves us here in about...
[01:35:03.171 --> 01:35:24.357]  Ten minutes or so, we are going to play a special report by Leanne McAdoo, where the vast majority of Southwest ding-dongs, dum-dums, airheads, totalitarians thinking they're liberal, none so blind as those that are dumber than a box of rocks, want Obama to basically run for a third term.
[01:35:25.233 --> 01:35:26.814]  We're going to play that video coming up.
[01:35:27.194 --> 01:35:32.378]  Then Darren McBreen has a good comedy piece exposing the war on drugs, but it literally happened.
[01:35:33.018 --> 01:35:35.780]  A guy in a Chewbacca suit smoking pot in front of Austin police.
[01:35:36.141 --> 01:35:39.043]  Chewbacca smokes pot in front of cops at South by Southwest.
[01:35:39.403 --> 01:35:40.804]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:35:41.024 --> 01:35:46.468]  And then we have the bombshell, earth-shattering news and information.
[01:35:47.605 --> 01:35:50.029]  We should probably get this video posted on Infowars.com.
[01:35:50.730 --> 01:35:52.573]  The detailed report from last night's nightly news.
[01:35:52.633 --> 01:35:54.096]  Military takeover plan reveals.
[01:35:54.637 --> 01:35:55.879]  Is your state next?
[01:35:56.941 --> 01:36:01.088]  And that ties into the feds saying that Texas and Utah are seen as hostile.
[01:36:02.441 --> 01:36:13.266]  In their martial law takeover drills that start this summer just south of us in Bastrop, there by the federal prison in Camp Swift, the former German prison of war camp.
[01:36:13.747 --> 01:36:15.487]  They held the krauts down there.
[01:36:15.768 --> 01:36:18.169]  Oh, political correctness, oh, so evil, I'm racist against the Germans now.
[01:36:19.249 --> 01:36:22.191]  The word kraut doesn't mean Germans are bad, it just means they eat a lot of kraut.
[01:36:23.168 --> 01:36:29.289]  Called the British Limeys, because 400 years ago they needed to put limes in their rum so their teeth wouldn't fall out with scurvy.
[01:36:29.770 --> 01:36:32.030]  Other people thought it was a weird convention, wouldn't do it.
[01:36:32.270 --> 01:36:39.492]  So the British Navy took over the world because their scientists figured out vitamin C before it was called vitamin C. But see, now it's just racist.
[01:36:39.972 --> 01:36:42.413]  See, it's to end language, end communication.
[01:36:42.933 --> 01:36:44.973]  Can't have a brown bag in Seattle, it's racist.
[01:36:46.193 --> 01:36:48.394]  It's all this imaginary subconscious stuff.
[01:36:49.665 --> 01:36:53.108]  Ignoring the globalists discriminating against all of us.
[01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:58.412]  But why is there no Starbucks coffee house in Selma or in Ferguson?
[01:36:58.953 --> 01:37:00.474]  Racism from Starbucks?
[01:37:02.105 --> 01:37:04.927]  Again, this is the new totalitarianism, but I divert.
[01:37:05.427 --> 01:37:08.429]  I digress would be the word, not divert.
[01:37:09.190 --> 01:37:16.614]  John McAfee, you've got the floor, sir, to break down your new exciting initiative that I really can't wait to be involved in.
[01:37:16.634 --> 01:37:17.915]  You've been talking about this a lot.
[01:37:18.315 --> 01:37:20.117]  Other folks are trying to develop similar things.
[01:37:20.697 --> 01:37:22.658]  There's two different fronts, defense, offense.
[01:37:23.078 --> 01:37:29.382]  Fight to get the Big Brother stuff dismantled, while making it as hard as we can for Big Brother to get and track our data.
[01:37:29.402 --> 01:37:47.211]  But not just Big Brother, we see data breaches because the back doors, I had the former head of the NSA operations on a few days ago, William Binney, he pointed out the fact that they have all these back doors built in lets criminal hackers and criminal groups go in and do data breaches everywhere, at Target, your personal computers, you name it.
[01:37:47.572 --> 01:37:49.993]  So this is something everybody should be doing, John McAfee.
[01:37:51.886 --> 01:38:02.194]  Yeah, my main company, Future 10 Central, builds applications for privacy and security on a very rigid basis.
[01:38:02.255 --> 01:38:03.395]  We have a product called
[01:38:04.949 --> 01:38:22.627]  Devices that will lock down your camera, your microphone, your Bluetooth, your Wi-Fi, whatever you like, so that even if one of these stingray devices is coming by, they can't at least see you and hear what you're saying if you're not using the phone for communication.
[01:38:24.609 --> 01:38:32.331]  But my biggest passion now is return our privacy to us.
[01:38:32.391 --> 01:38:34.171]  Give us back our privacy campaign.
[01:38:35.512 --> 01:38:36.712]  Because we have none.
[01:38:36.872 --> 01:38:37.712]  We have none at all.
[01:38:38.372 --> 01:38:41.873]  And you've made amazing animated videos, TV ads.
[01:38:41.893 --> 01:38:43.473]  I mean, you've really been fighting hard.
[01:38:44.374 --> 01:38:44.734]  I have.
[01:38:44.874 --> 01:38:45.174]  I have.
[01:38:47.372 --> 01:38:51.115]  Severely thrashed by the government.
[01:38:51.195 --> 01:38:59.741]  The NSA in particular does not like anybody saying what they're doing may be wrong.
[01:39:01.422 --> 01:39:04.284]  I have IRS audits.
[01:39:04.504 --> 01:39:12.149]  You named the harassment that can happen to someone and it's happening to me now.
[01:39:12.936 --> 01:39:14.156]  But I'm not stopping.
[01:39:14.316 --> 01:39:16.917]  It's something that, you know, I have to do.
[01:39:16.997 --> 01:39:18.457]  It's something I truly believe in.
[01:39:19.277 --> 01:39:25.458]  And something that... If we lose our privacy, Alex, we lose everything.
[01:39:26.658 --> 01:39:28.419]  We lose our humanity.
[01:39:28.659 --> 01:39:32.119]  And we're asking for help.
[01:39:32.499 --> 01:39:38.461]  Because, number one, I want to know how many of these Stingray devices Harris Corporation has sold.
[01:39:38.901 --> 01:39:40.601]  I guarantee you it's in the millions.
[01:39:41.361 --> 01:39:45.726]  And each one of these devices, let me, again, let me read you the... I was about to say, they're not that much.
[01:39:45.786 --> 01:39:49.410]  If one county bought half a million dollars worth, that's a ton of them.
[01:39:50.168 --> 01:39:50.608]  That's right.
[01:39:50.929 --> 01:40:15.584]  So, for example, Judge Simeon, a county supervisor, said to the sheriff, we are being asked to spend $500,000 of taxpayer money and $42,000 a year thereafter for a product, the name brand of which we're not sure of, the maker you cannot tell us, a product we have not seen, and a demonstration we cannot look at.
[01:40:16.945 --> 01:40:17.826]  As a precondition,
[01:40:19.088 --> 01:40:22.170]  And it's like, do you see the insanity of this?
[01:40:22.230 --> 01:40:30.415]  And yet, the police departments and FBI and government agencies all over are buying these because they create ultimate power.
[01:40:30.795 --> 01:40:32.796]  Because they collect the ultimate data.
[01:40:33.716 --> 01:40:35.477]  For example, here's another thing.
[01:40:44.173 --> 01:40:58.637]  What has opponents particularly concerned about Stingray is that the technology, unlike other phone surveillance methods, also scans all the cell phones in the area where it is being used, not just the target.
[01:40:59.884 --> 01:41:00.985]  It's scanning the area.
[01:41:01.646 --> 01:41:04.309]  And so, what is the government doing with that information?
[01:41:04.329 --> 01:41:08.293]  Well, I mean, that's what Google got in trouble with, with their Google car stealing people's passwords.
[01:41:08.573 --> 01:41:10.635]  This is criminal black hat hacking.
[01:41:11.676 --> 01:41:14.058]  They're committing felonies every millisecond with these.
[01:41:14.419 --> 01:41:18.163]  Of course they want to keep it secret, because then that'll kill the market for these things.
[01:41:19.426 --> 01:41:21.927]  Of course, and they're making a fortune on these things.
[01:41:22.007 --> 01:41:26.449]  It's a multi-billion dollar company, and one of the prime defense contractors.
[01:41:27.670 --> 01:41:37.414]  They allegedly only sell to law enforcement agencies, which you know for a fact that if the police have something, the bad guys have the same thing, and they've taken the part and looked at it, and they know what it is.
[01:41:38.127 --> 01:41:50.108]  There's no way to keep this away from the hands that are trying to keep it away from, but what they are doing is ensuring that all of us are constantly being monitored.
[01:41:50.868 --> 01:41:53.989]  Listen to, watch, and record it.
[01:41:54.029 --> 01:42:00.711]  They record this stuff because they pour through it later to not use the things they do not want.
[01:42:00.751 --> 01:42:07.633]  For example, what you might be saying to your neighbor while the guy across the street is the bad guy being listened to.
[01:42:08.333 --> 01:42:16.675]  This is a tragedy of the highest order, and it's frightening that people aren't up in arms going, I'm not going to take this anymore.
[01:42:16.735 --> 01:42:17.376]  I'm mad as hell.
[01:42:17.396 --> 01:42:18.556]  I'm not taking it anymore.
[01:42:19.176 --> 01:42:20.297]  But we have to stop this.
[01:42:20.537 --> 01:42:21.217]  We have to stop this.
[01:42:21.237 --> 01:42:22.958]  But it's such a nice Trojan horse.
[01:42:23.078 --> 01:42:24.318]  I mean, they gave it to us free.
[01:42:24.358 --> 01:42:28.860]  We should take it in at night and I'm sure it'll be very friendly when the soldiers come out with swords.
[01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:36.283]  I mean, that's what's happening here is a brazen, arrogant attempt to wire the world for surveillance and control.
[01:42:36.923 --> 01:42:40.205]  I'm not worried about a robo-apocalypse AI taking over.
[01:42:40.525 --> 01:42:41.825]  I think down the road that could happen.
[01:42:41.905 --> 01:42:42.986]  I'm worried about the fact that
[01:42:44.026 --> 01:42:51.232]  Already, all the appliances that are coming out that are, quote, smart, Samsung, Droid, iPhone, they all put their terms and conditions.
[01:42:51.653 --> 01:42:56.897]  Hey, we're recording your voice and turning the camera on for marketing and giving it to even outside parties.
[01:42:57.277 --> 01:42:59.839]  So, quote, Samsung, watch what you say.
[01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:04.943]  I mean, imagine in America, hey, you just bought a $3,000 Samsung Smart TV.
[01:43:05.804 --> 01:43:09.647]  If you read the 50 pages of stuff, watch what you say, Mac.
[01:43:10.088 --> 01:43:12.570]  I mean, it's just over the top.
[01:43:13.715 --> 01:43:14.476]  Well, not just that.
[01:43:15.317 --> 01:43:25.327]  I work with a gentleman who just left a company that does face recognition software and expression recognition software.
[01:43:26.147 --> 01:43:33.275]  They have a contract with Samsung to watch you while you're watching TV and note when you're smiling.
[01:43:33.955 --> 01:43:39.980]  We're laughing at a joke, and when you're not laughing at a joke, note when you feel you're looking different or bored.
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:41.080]  Think about this.
[01:43:41.621 --> 01:43:42.361]  Think about this.
[01:43:42.962 --> 01:43:45.904]  They are watching every single thing we do.
[01:43:45.964 --> 01:43:57.592]  And they warn us, by the way, that Samsung in the contract says, please, if you want to do a private conversation, don't do it in front of our television because it will be recorded and sent to a third, a nameless third party.
[01:43:58.373 --> 01:43:59.754]  We're putting up with this shit, Alex.
[01:44:01.344 --> 01:44:14.260]  I'm asking for people to volunteer in every single town in America to go using the Freedom of Information Act and demand
[01:44:14.927 --> 01:44:16.788]  How many of these devices do you have?
[01:44:17.208 --> 01:44:18.288]  What have you paid for them?
[01:44:18.688 --> 01:44:19.868]  What are you using them for?
[01:44:19.889 --> 01:44:22.129]  We have a right to know.
[01:44:22.509 --> 01:44:23.169]  Absolutely.
[01:44:23.209 --> 01:44:27.071]  John McAfee, folks can go to your newest website.
[01:44:27.091 --> 01:44:31.272]  You've got several that are excellent and find these new devices and programs.
[01:44:31.792 --> 01:44:32.252]  that you've
[01:44:52.924 --> 01:44:57.666]  In a piece probably titled, you know, meet the real John McAvee, not who they say you are.
[01:44:57.686 --> 01:45:00.087]  Because I've hung out with you a few times in Austin, gotten to know you.
[01:45:00.407 --> 01:45:03.828]  You're a totally different guy than what the media basically portrays you as.
[01:45:04.689 --> 01:45:07.910]  Maybe even have our crew come out sometime and interview you where you're at in that rural area.
[01:45:07.950 --> 01:45:10.531]  That'd be kind of a Vice-style report.
[01:45:11.211 --> 01:45:13.372]  But you're doing a great job promoting freedom.
[01:45:13.692 --> 01:45:16.013]  So thank you so much for joining us, John McAvee.
[01:45:16.856 --> 01:45:28.029]  And for your listeners out there, if you would like to donate, because this is a very expensive campaign to try to locate these things, please send to privacy at futuretentcentral.com.
[01:45:28.730 --> 01:45:30.732]  Any comments, support, or help you'd like to give.
[01:45:30.772 --> 01:45:31.433]  Thank you very much.
[01:45:31.593 --> 01:45:32.114]  Absolutely.
[01:45:32.174 --> 01:45:34.477]  Privacy at futuretentcentral.com.
[01:45:34.817 --> 01:45:36.239]  John, we'll talk to you again soon, buddy.
[01:45:37.039 --> 01:45:37.320]  Thank you.
[01:45:38.095 --> 01:45:43.981]  Now, we're going to go to this piece by Leanne McAdoo showing the frightening behavior of the Democrats.
[01:45:44.422 --> 01:45:50.888]  The majority of them she talked to here in Austin yesterday and South by Southwest want Lord Obama to run for a third term.
[01:45:51.448 --> 01:45:55.032]  Let's go ahead and play this report from last night's InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:45:55.252 --> 01:45:57.314]  We'll come back from break and get into more news.
[01:45:57.334 --> 01:45:57.795]  Stay with us.
[01:46:01.685 --> 01:46:03.586]  Hillary has kind of been doing such a bad job.
[01:46:03.606 --> 01:46:08.787]  The Democrats don't really have anybody, and Obama is toying with the idea of running for a third term.
[01:46:09.587 --> 01:46:12.688]  We want to put out a video that tells him to do it.
[01:46:12.708 --> 01:46:16.449]  I already voted for you last year, so I'll vote for you again next time too.
[01:46:16.589 --> 01:46:18.289]  Or not last year, but last term.
[01:46:18.669 --> 01:46:21.930]  Obama, you should run for a third term because we need you.
[01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:22.790]  Obama's third term?
[01:46:24.150 --> 01:46:25.250]  No.
[01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:27.671]  Are you guys lined up to vote for Obama's third term?
[01:46:29.587 --> 01:46:31.008]  Is that why everyone's here in line?
[01:46:31.568 --> 01:46:33.229]  We need Obama to run for the third term.
[01:46:33.629 --> 01:46:37.052]  So I want the whole country to vote for Obama.
[01:46:37.072 --> 01:46:39.313]  Are you here voting for Obama's third term?
[01:46:39.474 --> 01:46:40.254]  Yes, of course.
[01:46:40.334 --> 01:46:42.636]  I honestly think, why not?
[01:46:42.956 --> 01:46:44.297]  Obama's the first black president.
[01:46:44.357 --> 01:46:46.338]  Why would I be the first person in history to go three terms?
[01:46:47.517 --> 01:46:48.198]  What about Obama?
[01:46:48.818 --> 01:46:52.522]  I think Obama is going to give it a shot, but it's still pretty important.
[01:46:52.762 --> 01:46:54.764]  I'm going to go with he's not going to get this one done.
[01:46:54.784 --> 01:46:56.466]  Obama to run for a third term?
[01:46:56.486 --> 01:46:56.626]  Boo!
[01:46:56.666 --> 01:46:56.926]  Boo!
[01:46:57.047 --> 01:47:00.130]  You forget what state you're in.
[01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:05.055]  I don't hate it, it sounds all right to me, but I'm America, so that's all that matters.
[01:47:06.056 --> 01:47:13.203]  Well, if you love America, then you know the Constitution has a 22nd Amendment, and he can't run for a third term, even though he wants to!
[01:47:13.444 --> 01:47:15.246]  I know he can, but I didn't know he wanted to run.
[01:47:15.506 --> 01:47:19.090]  I'd say he did a good job, but I just don't think we need to have a president in office.
[01:47:20.151 --> 01:47:22.974]  You know, if we were to limit to, like, four terms?
[01:47:24.082 --> 01:47:25.083]  That wouldn't be too bad.
[01:47:25.123 --> 01:47:26.264]  Third term.
[01:47:26.564 --> 01:47:27.185]  Make it happen.
[01:47:27.425 --> 01:47:27.645]  Boom.
[01:47:27.846 --> 01:47:28.046]  Boom.
[01:47:28.306 --> 01:47:30.068]  Obama, run for a third term.
[01:47:30.088 --> 01:47:33.711]  We really don't want him to, so... Do I think he can make it happen?
[01:47:33.751 --> 01:47:34.071]  Yes.
[01:47:34.271 --> 01:47:35.853]  Do we care about the amendments?
[01:47:36.013 --> 01:47:39.016]  Or the Constitution?
[01:47:39.096 --> 01:47:42.219]  I don't think it's an option, so I think we're okay.
[01:47:42.479 --> 01:47:44.081]  Obama, third term!
[01:47:44.161 --> 01:47:45.822]  It's for the kids!
[01:47:46.303 --> 01:47:46.763]  It's for us!
[01:47:47.204 --> 01:47:49.266]  No, I do not want that man for a third term.
[01:47:49.306 --> 01:47:51.789]  Our government can go ahead and burn itself down before I do.
[01:47:51.809 --> 01:47:53.131]  So are you going to vote for Hillary?
[01:47:53.471 --> 01:47:54.292]  I ain't voting for any of them.
[01:47:54.332 --> 01:47:55.353]  That woman doesn't need to run either.
[01:47:55.373 --> 01:47:56.475]  So are you going to vote for Bush?
[01:47:56.875 --> 01:47:57.876]  I ain't voting for none of them.
[01:47:58.357 --> 01:47:59.118]  You can't do that.
[01:47:59.738 --> 01:47:59.919]  Why?
[01:48:00.919 --> 01:48:02.460]  You can only do two terms.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.502]  We just gotta do away with that pesky 22nd amendment?
[01:48:05.562 --> 01:48:06.102]  Don't think so.
[01:48:06.322 --> 01:48:06.482]  Yeah?
[01:48:06.522 --> 01:48:08.844]  Four more years?
[01:48:08.944 --> 01:48:10.184]  Can't do that.
[01:48:10.244 --> 01:48:11.605]  Sorry, I'm pro-America.
[01:48:12.185 --> 01:48:16.428]  There's a reason that Hillary Clinton is not up for this in charge of the United States.
[01:48:16.728 --> 01:48:25.613]  He has signed a lot of executive orders and this is something that he thinks that it could be fun to kind of mess around with the amendments and people want him to run for a third term.
[01:48:26.033 --> 01:48:27.234]  The Democrats have no one.
[01:48:27.914 --> 01:48:31.377]  That may be the case, but you know, the Constitution's kind of important.
[01:48:31.417 --> 01:48:38.002]  If you don't vote for Obama for a third term, you're voting for Bush or Hillary, so... Well, like a different Bush?
[01:48:38.082 --> 01:48:39.243]  Yeah!
[01:48:39.383 --> 01:48:39.544]  Oh!
[01:48:40.164 --> 01:48:40.845]  Baby brother Bush.
[01:48:40.865 --> 01:48:44.187]  Sounds like a Triple Lose situation to me.
[01:48:47.610 --> 01:48:52.954]  You can see the report at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:48:54.095 --> 01:48:55.797]  Again, that was Leanne McAdoo.
[01:48:57.714 --> 01:49:00.716]  And the thing about the grassroots liberals, they really mean well.
[01:49:00.756 --> 01:49:10.080]  They're just happy trendies that just go through life smiling and want to be sweet and do what they're told to be part of the team and work with everybody.
[01:49:10.100 --> 01:49:15.383]  Yeah, yeah, let's put the gun owners in a forced labor camp.
[01:49:15.523 --> 01:49:18.104]  Yeah, let's ban the hydrogen monoxide.
[01:49:18.165 --> 01:49:19.625]  It sounds eerie.
[01:49:20.626 --> 01:49:26.389]  I'm going to comply my whole life and the big foreign mega banks that own everything care about me.
[01:49:27.455 --> 01:49:35.340]  And all the TV shows are about being funny and silly and... Meanwhile it's all mechanized pure power, pure evil.
[01:49:39.623 --> 01:49:44.387]  They have trained the general population to live in continued suspended disbelief.
[01:49:45.928 --> 01:49:49.730]  We're gonna go to break and come back and get to the news I haven't covered yet.
[01:49:51.051 --> 01:49:51.892]  Inside the U.S.
[01:49:51.952 --> 01:49:53.173]  antitrust probe of Google,
[01:49:56.111 --> 01:50:03.298]  23 dreamers so far from Obama's amnesty snared in criminal dragnet as 167,000 criminal aliens are loose in the U.S.
[01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:11.346]  We're going to get into California farmers skip planting shell water to desperate cities.
[01:50:12.407 --> 01:50:17.211]  The DEA is seizing cash without warrants in its version of stop and frisk.
[01:50:19.093 --> 01:50:20.815]  And a lot more here today.
[01:50:22.631 --> 01:50:34.760]  And of course, we also have joining us Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on the huge developments in Russia, with Russia openly talking about using nukes against the West with the Ukraine situation.
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:37.142]  All this and more is coming up briefly.
[01:50:37.762 --> 01:50:39.322]  Keep spreading the word about the broadcast.
[01:50:39.382 --> 01:50:40.263]  The system hates it.
[01:50:40.623 --> 01:50:48.065]  It's having a big effect transcending all the fake political paradigms and getting down to basic liberty, basic renaissance, and exposing social engineers.
[01:50:48.405 --> 01:50:49.525]  And we've got 10% off.
[01:50:49.545 --> 01:50:51.206]  I've decided to extend it through Sunday.
[01:50:51.786 --> 01:50:53.086]  It's going to end Sunday afternoon.
[01:50:54.366 --> 01:50:57.507]  10% off everything with promo code SUPER because folks want me to extend it to the weekend.
[01:50:57.867 --> 01:51:00.048]  And then we won't have a sale like this for a long time.

[01:51:39.417 --> 01:51:40.178]  This is Dan Pilla.
[01:51:40.198 --> 01:51:41.719]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:51:42.019 --> 01:51:43.300]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:46.001]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:46.482 --> 01:51:48.343]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:48.783 --> 01:51:52.826]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:51:53.286 --> 01:51:56.989]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:51:57.229 --> 01:52:00.691]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[01:52:01.011 --> 01:52:01.432]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:52:01.452 --> 01:52:03.073]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:52:08.536 --> 01:52:11.097]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:52:11.358 --> 01:52:16.240]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:24.364]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:52:24.605 --> 01:52:28.907]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:52:29.127 --> 01:52:32.949]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:52:33.089 --> 01:52:38.813]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:52:39.033 --> 01:52:41.815]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:52:42.215 --> 01:52:47.439]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:52:47.579 --> 01:52:55.704]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:52:55.764 --> 01:52:55.944]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:53:03.169 --> 01:53:09.398]  Hey, sorry I'm running late.
[01:53:09.498 --> 01:53:11.360]  I had to stop and get my vitamins for the month.
[01:53:11.681 --> 01:53:14.504]  I got mine in the mail yesterday from DiscountNutritionShop.com.
[01:53:14.525 --> 01:53:16.387]  So I'm here totally on time.
[01:53:17.253 --> 01:53:19.014]  DiscountNutritionShop.com?
[01:53:19.335 --> 01:53:21.656]  Yep, they're a lifesaver in more ways than one.

[01:53:28.381 --> 01:53:30.003]  Or just go to DiscountNutritionShop.com.
[01:53:37.659 --> 01:53:40.900]  The clean and green sale continues at Guns80.com.
[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:45.562]  My buddy Mark is rolling in clover since Guns80.com announced its clean and green sale.
[01:53:46.042 --> 01:53:52.344]  He used his leprechaun-like magical powers to get Guns80.com to offer us a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

[01:54:21.222 --> 01:54:24.186]  Coming up in the next hour, Leanne McAdoo's report.
[01:54:24.206 --> 01:54:26.549]  There's a whole bunch of these powerful reports, that's why I'm airing them.
[01:54:27.190 --> 01:54:29.032]  Armed black militants prep for war.
[01:54:29.473 --> 01:54:31.616]  Jakari Jackson and Kit Daniels video.
[01:54:32.477 --> 01:54:35.741]  It has pretty good audio, but it's hidden camera, so it's not good for radio.
[01:54:35.801 --> 01:54:36.082]  It's not...
[01:54:36.442 --> 01:54:39.324]  That might not translate well on AM radio, but it's very powerful.
[01:54:39.705 --> 01:54:49.192]  It's linked on DrudgeReport.com and Infowars.com, an inside investigation of the brainwashing and social engineering, re-education camp stuff going on at Starbucks.
[01:54:49.533 --> 01:54:50.333]  That's what that is.
[01:54:50.754 --> 01:54:53.316]  See, when you study history, it's giant re-education camp stuff.
[01:54:54.056 --> 01:54:58.540]  That's why Hillary came out and said we need re-education camps and talked to the audience like they were five years old.
[01:54:58.580 --> 01:54:59.421]  That's what this is all about.
[01:55:00.592 --> 01:55:03.393]  That sounds weird when you hear me say it, because you've never lived in a re-education camp.
[01:55:03.873 --> 01:55:05.634]  When you've studied them, you know exactly what it is.
[01:55:06.554 --> 01:55:07.335]  So that's coming up.
[01:55:07.435 --> 01:55:11.676]  I want to go to this piece by Darren McBreen, exposing the phony drug war.
[01:55:12.456 --> 01:55:15.197]  The title of it is Chewbacca Smokes Weed.
[01:55:15.858 --> 01:55:16.358]  Here it is.
[01:55:16.378 --> 01:55:19.639]  It's stimulating.
[01:55:20.579 --> 01:55:22.500]  Mind-extending.
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:24.381]  Safer to use than alcohol.
[01:55:25.181 --> 01:55:26.282]  It's the end thing.
[01:55:27.282 --> 01:55:29.743]  Such are the myths concerning marijuana.
[01:55:30.925 --> 01:55:35.708]  Myths that lull thousands of young people into experimenting with obnoxious weed.
[01:55:37.149 --> 01:55:40.751]  Marijuana, the burning weed with its roots in hell.
[01:55:41.593 --> 01:55:43.053]  Should marijuana be legalized?
[01:55:43.413 --> 01:55:45.314]  We'll debate the pros and cons right now.
[01:55:45.554 --> 01:55:48.194]  Marijuana leads to doing worse things.
[01:55:48.234 --> 01:55:49.034]  That's just a fact.
[01:55:49.074 --> 01:55:50.235]  I don't care what anybody says.
[01:55:50.255 --> 01:55:57.356]  The drug war is a total failure and the federal drug war ought to be revisited and for the most part gotten rid of.
[01:55:57.556 --> 01:55:58.916]  This has corrupted our government.
[01:55:59.216 --> 01:56:05.858]  It has destroyed our due process and it is withholding from people medicine that is very effective and we need to stop it.
[01:56:06.218 --> 01:56:08.398]  We need to roll prohibition back right now.
[01:56:08.578 --> 01:56:09.759]  Marijuana is natural.
[01:56:09.859 --> 01:56:15.581]  You know, there's so many different things that you can use it for, including, you know, helping cancer patients.
[01:56:15.881 --> 01:56:16.882]  I'm a Christian minister.
[01:56:17.302 --> 01:56:17.482]  Yeah.
[01:56:17.722 --> 01:56:19.583]  And I believe, you know, Jesus would be okay with it.
[01:56:19.963 --> 01:56:24.465]  There have been studies proven that children who have 400 seizures a day, that's intense.
[01:56:24.525 --> 01:56:28.207]  It's like, that's like a seizure a minute, who can't stop just violently convulsing, have been helped.
[01:56:28.607 --> 01:56:34.531]  The mandatory minimums locking people up for non-violent crimes for very long periods of time where there's no discretion for the fact that they were non-violent, that this is their first offense.
[01:56:34.551 --> 01:56:35.471]  No, just lock them up.
[01:56:52.561 --> 01:57:01.887]  Think about the tens of billions of dollars that Big Pharma makes a year, with close to 20% of the population being on antidepressants, when every major study shows that marijuana
[01:57:18.138 --> 01:57:29.702]  It absolutely destroys depression in people, and Prozac can't even prove that it has any measurable positive effect, and they have to put on the insert that it may make you commit suicide.
[01:57:29.962 --> 01:57:35.263]  Things like alcohol kill people daily, and it's legal because it can be taxed.
[01:57:35.584 --> 01:57:37.624]  Happy to deliver alcohol.
[01:57:38.545 --> 01:57:39.725]  But weed is illegal, right?
[01:57:39.825 --> 01:57:41.846]  Hey bud, let's party!
[01:57:49.594 --> 01:57:52.335]  I do think, however, that the pharmaceutical companies should stay away.
[01:57:52.355 --> 01:57:53.896]  Like, just keep it natural.
[01:57:53.936 --> 01:57:56.597]  Let's have the sun out, you know, like, roasting seeds in the dirt.
[01:57:56.737 --> 01:57:58.157]  You know, like, just stay away.
[01:57:58.297 --> 01:57:59.218]  You know, let it be.
[01:57:59.238 --> 01:58:00.618]  You know, like, let it grow organically.
[01:58:00.658 --> 01:58:02.499]  And, like, that's what will help people.
[01:58:02.539 --> 01:58:06.941]  It definitely should not be legal because that's helping us make money on the streets.
[01:58:07.141 --> 01:58:07.981]  End probation.
[01:58:08.121 --> 01:58:08.622]  That's right!
[01:58:08.642 --> 01:58:08.842]  Peace!
[01:58:09.162 --> 01:58:10.362]  What's the obstacle?
[01:58:10.382 --> 01:58:11.483]  What the hell is stopping it?
[01:58:11.523 --> 01:58:13.203]  Why is Texas taking so long?
[01:58:13.223 --> 01:58:14.344]  Because we're in Texas, dude.
[01:58:14.804 --> 01:58:17.188]  They haven't figured out how to make money off of it yet.
[01:58:17.208 --> 01:58:18.930]  They're looking at all the benefits.
[01:58:19.010 --> 01:58:22.295]  They don't care about the health benefits.
[01:58:22.656 --> 01:58:25.179]  They know that we're making so much money off the cancer and whatnot.
[01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:26.782]  They want us to be unhealthy.
[01:58:26.802 --> 01:58:28.925]  There's so many benefits for something that's natural.
[01:58:29.085 --> 01:58:30.227]  We need to look more into natural.
[01:58:30.327 --> 01:58:31.208]  It's a good report.
[01:58:31.268 --> 01:58:33.149]  The whole thing's on Infowars.com.
[01:58:33.169 --> 01:58:37.253]  He photoshopped him in a real Chewbacca smoking pot in front of the cops.
[01:58:37.993 --> 01:58:41.036]  I don't like the whole marijuana culture, but it does have a lot of medical benefits.
[01:58:41.076 --> 01:58:43.758]  They keep it illegal so they can throw people in prison.
[01:58:43.778 --> 01:58:44.979]  We need to end Prohibition now.
[01:58:45.499 --> 01:58:46.941]  Everybody basically agrees on that.
[01:58:46.981 --> 01:58:47.501]  We'll be back.
[01:58:49.863 --> 01:58:51.825]  Thank you for listening to GCN Live.
[01:58:52.945 --> 01:58:53.966]  Prohibition will end.
[01:58:54.006 --> 01:58:55.327]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:55.387 --> 01:58:56.809]  It's a libertarian world, folks.
[01:59:00.380 --> 01:59:01.442]  In the near future.
[01:59:01.743 --> 01:59:05.388]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:59:05.408 --> 01:59:05.889]  Security alert.
[01:59:06.249 --> 01:59:07.271]  Security alert.
[01:59:07.471 --> 01:59:09.214]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:59:09.474 --> 01:59:13.160]  Analysis, InfoWars, building independent media operations.
[01:59:13.180 --> 01:59:15.784]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we
[01:59:15.964 --> 01:59:18.007]  We are the ones responsible.
[01:59:18.047 --> 01:59:20.390]  Crime directive discredit Alex Jones.
[01:59:20.590 --> 01:59:23.394]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:59:23.474 --> 01:59:26.538]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[01:59:26.718 --> 01:59:28.961]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:59:29.021 --> 01:59:30.543]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:59:30.583 --> 01:59:32.826]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:59:33.386 --> 01:59:35.047]  They are never going to stop.
[01:59:35.327 --> 01:59:38.968]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:59:39.008 --> 01:59:45.610]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:50.571]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[02:00:01.676 --> 02:00:13.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:15.161 --> 02:00:15.821]  Big Brother.
[02:00:16.482 --> 02:00:17.522]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:18.242 --> 02:00:19.363]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:20.023 --> 02:00:20.823]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.584 --> 02:00:22.484]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.144 --> 02:00:26.766]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.326 --> 02:00:29.667]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:31.568 --> 02:00:42.258]  I am opening the phones up at the start of the next segment on the specifics of NorthCom and SouthCom admitting they're training for domestic operations and PSYOPs to condition us for military occupation.
[02:00:42.939 --> 02:00:49.305]  I know this was going on for a while, but they list Utah and Texas as hostile areas in the west of the country.
[02:00:50.589 --> 02:00:51.670]  We're gonna be taking your calls 800-259-9231.
[02:00:51.690 --> 02:00:51.730]  800-259-9231.
[02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:53.310]  Coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:56.032]  I'd love to hear from active duty or veterans on this especially.
[02:00:56.052 --> 02:00:57.232]  First-time callers, folks.
[02:00:57.252 --> 02:00:57.313]  800-259-9231.
[02:00:57.433 --> 02:00:58.513]  On that topic for two segments.
[02:01:07.938 --> 02:01:09.559]  Then Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us.
[02:01:09.879 --> 02:01:10.999]  It's a seven minute report.
[02:01:11.059 --> 02:01:12.440]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:14.581]  I want to air about five minutes of it right now.
[02:01:15.141 --> 02:01:16.982]  Armed black militants prep for war.
[02:01:17.462 --> 02:01:21.023]  Group chanting various anti-police slogans including oink oink bang bang.
[02:01:21.483 --> 02:01:23.084]  Then they claim they're an open carry group.
[02:01:24.022 --> 02:01:27.705]  Well, fine, I'm all for open carry to condition folks that the Second Amendment's A-OK.
[02:01:27.906 --> 02:01:28.866]  That's our own PSYOP.
[02:01:29.507 --> 02:01:31.329]  But not to make it about killing the cops.
[02:01:31.369 --> 02:01:34.732]  You see these poor police out there, the ones we talked to, definitely.
[02:01:34.752 --> 02:01:38.275]  I mean, can you imagine just walking up and shooting one of them in the head for no reason?
[02:01:38.315 --> 02:01:39.536]  I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[02:01:40.537 --> 02:01:42.899]  And it's all what George Soros loves to push.
[02:01:42.959 --> 02:01:43.560]  More division.
[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:45.021]  Here's part of the report.
[02:01:47.263 --> 02:01:48.184]  Leanne McAdrean.
[02:01:56.943 --> 02:01:59.284]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:01:59.384 --> 02:02:03.146]  I'm out here at South by Southwest and we just saw some tweets on Twitter.
[02:02:03.546 --> 02:02:08.308]  People were saying that the Black Panthers are out here doing an open carry march.
[02:02:08.948 --> 02:02:15.931]  So obviously we got to go try and find these guys and of course see what the people out here at South by Southwest think about a bunch of guns in their face.
[02:02:18.530 --> 02:02:18.670]  Hey!
[02:02:18.770 --> 02:02:19.030]  Hey!
[02:02:19.191 --> 02:02:19.471]  Hey!
[02:02:19.551 --> 02:02:19.711]  Hey!
[02:02:19.791 --> 02:02:20.131]  Hey!
[02:02:20.231 --> 02:02:20.451]  Hey!
[02:02:34.269 --> 02:02:35.270]  They started the war.
[02:02:35.850 --> 02:02:38.691]  A lot of people like to say this might start a race war.
[02:02:39.292 --> 02:02:46.956]  But we would like to say the race war started when he bust the first black man upside the head in Africa and drug us over here in Chain.
[02:02:47.997 --> 02:02:49.037]  Who is the real criminal?
[02:02:49.677 --> 02:02:51.078]  Who is the real gangbanger?
[02:02:52.459 --> 02:02:58.802]  When they can drag our people, bust them upside the head, make them pick cotton, and build this country.
[02:02:59.623 --> 02:03:01.304]  Please, tell us your manifesto.
[02:03:02.937 --> 02:03:13.206]  So, essentially what we're doing here, this is the Huey P. Newton Gun Club, and we're just demonstrating, number one, our gun rights, and number two, we're taking a position against police brutality, which we say is a euphemism for police terrorism.
[02:03:13.587 --> 02:03:19.052]  Okay, so what do you want to say to people who think that open carry and things like this is promoting violence?
[02:03:19.898 --> 02:03:21.919]  It's nothing violent about bearing arms.
[02:03:21.939 --> 02:03:23.000]  It's not anything violent.
[02:03:23.020 --> 02:03:26.342]  In fact, over 99% of America bears arms.
[02:03:26.762 --> 02:03:28.423]  And so, that's not anything violent.
[02:03:28.443 --> 02:03:30.644]  In fact, we're telling people that they do have rights.
[02:03:30.905 --> 02:03:31.605]  That's nothing violent.
[02:03:31.645 --> 02:03:34.146]  This is not open carry, though, when you're saying that men can kill cops.
[02:03:34.266 --> 02:03:34.907]  It discredits it.
[02:03:35.307 --> 02:03:42.251]  And what's been the response from all the people out here, probably a global audience, witnessing this happening, which is incredible.
[02:03:42.611 --> 02:03:43.432]  What's been the response?
[02:03:44.005 --> 02:03:46.467]  Essentially, the people have been very supportive.
[02:03:46.747 --> 02:03:48.107]  We've been allowed to educate the people.
[02:03:48.128 --> 02:03:53.311]  I mean, so that's our first and foremost position is make sure people understand what and why we're doing what we're doing.
[02:03:53.631 --> 02:03:59.194]  And today's demonstration was all about dealing with the issues of police brutality, which we say is euphemism for police terrorism.
[02:04:00.215 --> 02:04:03.356]  I guarantee you the feds are running this group.
[02:04:11.474 --> 02:04:19.457]  A lot of people mean well, but just talk to obsessive or stuff that happened hundreds of years ago when everybody has oppression in their past.
[02:04:20.137 --> 02:04:25.579]  You think he got hit in the head in Africa?
[02:04:25.599 --> 02:04:27.839]  I mean, I've had racist black people attack me growing up in Dallas.
[02:04:27.899 --> 02:04:28.980]  I don't blame all black people.
[02:04:31.745 --> 02:04:38.889]  Because you can pray all you want to, and when you get up off your knees, and you find that it's a cracker, with a pen in their hand.
[02:04:39.349 --> 02:04:41.110]  The cracker does it all, yeah right.
[02:04:41.170 --> 02:04:44.272]  Why don't you protest against half of blacks getting aborted?
[02:04:44.312 --> 02:04:47.053]  We haven't joined Open Carry Texas and Prime Minister.
[02:04:47.253 --> 02:04:47.733]  It's crazy!
[02:04:47.753 --> 02:04:51.415]  Their issue is primarily dealing with gun rights, whereas our issue is a little bit different.
[02:04:51.715 --> 02:04:53.876]  We're taking a position against police brutality.
[02:04:54.016 --> 02:05:01.099]  I think we favor some gun rights, and we do have some connections with that, but our primary position against police brutality, fratricide, is the issue that exists.
[02:05:01.459 --> 02:05:03.219]  Alright folks, we'll be back.
[02:05:03.279 --> 02:05:04.160]  Stay with us.
[02:05:04.460 --> 02:05:06.181]  We'll take your phone calls on the other side.
[02:05:06.201 --> 02:05:07.001]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:09.266 --> 02:05:13.108]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[02:05:13.868 --> 02:05:20.132]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[02:05:20.252 --> 02:05:29.277]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.
[02:05:29.637 --> 02:05:34.479]  Supercharge and conquer your world at InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:05:39.192 --> 02:05:42.693]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:42.853 --> 02:05:46.813]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:47.133 --> 02:05:48.574]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:48.914 --> 02:05:56.495]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:05:56.755 --> 02:05:57.615]  But for how long?
[02:05:57.895 --> 02:06:04.156]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:06:04.536 --> 02:06:07.357]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:06:09.386 --> 02:06:10.207]  Alex Jones here.
[02:06:10.307 --> 02:06:19.354]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:06:19.534 --> 02:06:24.758]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.
[02:06:25.098 --> 02:06:28.621]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[02:06:28.821 --> 02:06:38.167]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge and prepare your body for what experts admit is the most dangerous season of the year.
[02:06:38.387 --> 02:06:49.555]  We have rejected hundreds of other formulations in our quest to bring you what is simply the most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that we have ever created in the realm of herbal immunity.
[02:06:49.795 --> 02:06:54.558]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts
[02:06:54.778 --> 02:06:57.761]  With exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[02:06:58.141 --> 02:07:01.424]  Now is the time to secure ancient defense for you and your family.
[02:07:01.544 --> 02:07:04.127]  Visit Infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:07:04.147 --> 02:07:06.069]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:06.129 --> 02:07:07.890]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[02:07:07.950 --> 02:07:10.092]  Good, brother.
[02:07:10.273 --> 02:07:11.934]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:07:11.974 --> 02:07:13.756]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:07:13.936 --> 02:07:18.040]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:22.783]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:07:22.983 --> 02:07:30.888]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:07:31.148 --> 02:07:34.270]  We did the Super Male and the Super Female Vitality.
[02:07:34.410 --> 02:07:35.910]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:07:35.931 --> 02:07:40.373]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, saving a ton of money there.
[02:07:40.633 --> 02:07:43.055]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[02:07:44.396 --> 02:08:00.608]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience where stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source so it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[02:08:18.803 --> 02:08:21.024]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:08:21.484 --> 02:08:23.965]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:24.465 --> 02:08:26.866]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:27.106 --> 02:08:29.567]  The Death Machine!
[02:08:29.867 --> 02:08:32.348]  There's a paradox!
[02:08:46.328 --> 02:08:56.532]  When I talk about the police and military on average being more aware of what's going on the general public, well they are because they're being put to the process of being turned into basically globalist stooges.
[02:08:58.433 --> 02:09:09.237]  And they also have to deal with the mainstream media basically using them for cat and fodder and demonizing them and taking things out of context, while at the same time claiming that they support them.
[02:09:09.737 --> 02:09:12.578]  That's only meant to put the police into their own little cult.
[02:09:13.775 --> 02:09:25.063]  And then the Feds can come in and basically say, join us and then we won't prosecute you and set you up with the huge anti-police capital that they're building up in the media and in the culture.
[02:09:25.903 --> 02:09:28.465]  You'd think the only abuse in the world is the police.
[02:09:29.345 --> 02:09:33.228]  And believe me, there are a lot of out-of-control cops, a lot of thugs, a lot of crazy people in society.
[02:09:33.928 --> 02:09:39.032]  I've talked to a lot of executives, a lot of folks, and they just say, public school principals, you name it.
[02:09:39.052 --> 02:09:40.693]  Craziness is just intensifying.
[02:09:42.248 --> 02:09:45.953]  And I mean, I've run into the most arrogant, hateful, crazy police you can imagine.
[02:09:46.815 --> 02:09:47.936]  Also run into a lot of good police.
[02:09:48.597 --> 02:09:54.706]  But the issue here is that clearly and admittedly,
[02:09:55.899 --> 02:10:10.030]  They're trying to start a civil war in this country and make every bad about local government and the police while the federal government has been totally taken over by foreign interests and is preparing to finally implode and take everything over completely.
[02:10:10.551 --> 02:10:14.874]  And use financial collapse as a tool of ruination on our journey to slavery.
[02:10:17.696 --> 02:10:18.437]  It's real simple.
[02:10:18.477 --> 02:10:23.161]  George Soros funds getting our guns, opening our borders, and going after the police.
[02:10:24.841 --> 02:10:31.583]  And then it's out in the news that he and Bill and Melinda Gates and others are investing in all the same garbage they claim they're opposing.
[02:10:33.103 --> 02:10:37.104]  They need us at each other's throats while they screw us over.
[02:10:38.724 --> 02:10:39.665]  But that's wearing thin.
[02:10:39.705 --> 02:10:41.785]  The establishment tried to sell Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton.
[02:10:42.505 --> 02:10:43.605]  They've fallen flat on their face.
[02:10:43.625 --> 02:10:49.287]  The establishment knows they need some new rock star like Obama to fool folks a few more years and kick the can down the road.
[02:10:49.767 --> 02:10:54.148]  The only way for the elites to kick the can down the road is to start truly reforming.
[02:10:55.779 --> 02:10:56.580]  They don't want reform.
[02:10:56.620 --> 02:11:03.744]  They want to monopolize power and control for global domination in the energy race, in the life extension race, to control the future.
[02:11:05.185 --> 02:11:12.009]  So they'll redistribute wealth to control people, but they won't let free market go and innovation go, because that might threaten their monopoly.
[02:11:12.269 --> 02:11:19.093]  The only way you're going to keep the power you have and have a little bit of it in the future is to divest centralization.
[02:11:19.974 --> 02:11:21.375]  Go the Renaissance route.
[02:11:22.270 --> 02:11:23.350]  Believe in humanity.
[02:11:23.871 --> 02:11:26.131]  Turn back against your eugenicist ways.
[02:11:26.932 --> 02:11:30.233]  Well, you've come too close to realizing your horrible plans, so I know you're not.
[02:11:30.753 --> 02:11:33.834]  I'm talking to your underlings, who have been compartmentalized.
[02:11:34.134 --> 02:11:37.896]  We're here to decompartmentalize people in the corporate and governing systems.
[02:11:39.176 --> 02:11:41.277]  And believe me, they tune in and they are decompartmentalized.
[02:11:41.797 --> 02:11:44.638]  Because, no brag, just fact, I know what I'm talking about.
[02:11:44.658 --> 02:11:51.121]  I know the terms, I know the players, I know the game, I know the strategic long-term goals.
[02:11:53.185 --> 02:12:01.388]  You go pay $5,000 in New York or London or Vegas to hear top futurists and globalists speak, you'll hear exactly what I'm saying, but from their perspectives.
[02:12:02.369 --> 02:12:11.932]  I know a lot of billionaires and CEOs and people, and they listen to this show every day because they know, I know what I'm talking about.
[02:12:12.572 --> 02:12:18.995]  And the reason I throw that out there at people is, you ignore this information at your very serious peril.
[02:12:23.390 --> 02:12:25.231]  There are a lot of people know what's going on.
[02:12:25.791 --> 02:12:29.332]  There are a lot of people in the government know what's going on and don't want this to happen.
[02:12:31.153 --> 02:12:32.393]  But they're compartmentalized.
[02:12:32.894 --> 02:12:38.256]  We get enough people aware in the general public of what's happening and the games won't work anymore.
[02:12:39.076 --> 02:12:41.137]  You think, well, half the public can't tie their shoelaces.
[02:12:41.417 --> 02:12:42.357]  It's game over, Alex.
[02:12:42.657 --> 02:12:43.558]  No, it's not game over.
[02:12:45.498 --> 02:12:49.060]  Because, sure, maybe half the public can't wipe their own hind end with both hands.
[02:12:50.370 --> 02:12:52.231]  Can't find their head from a hole in the ground.
[02:12:52.992 --> 02:12:53.372]  I get it.
[02:12:54.373 --> 02:12:55.774]  I'm sorry, those people don't count.
[02:12:56.034 --> 02:12:59.336]  The globalists tried to make everybody dumb so that only they would count.
[02:12:59.416 --> 02:13:07.982]  But if we're on the other side awake, the fact that the general public can't tie their shoelaces only makes us stronger as well, because we are the largest minority.
[02:13:09.861 --> 02:13:11.682]  People that are aware of the globalist paradigm.
[02:13:11.922 --> 02:13:19.906]  And that's why they're desperate to get the dumbed-down masses fighting with each other to think that that's the reason they're losing their house and losing their job and things are going to hell in a handbasket.
[02:13:20.606 --> 02:13:25.949]  They need to think it's because Whitey did it, or Black did it, or Hispanics did it, or the Easter Bunny did it.
[02:13:26.449 --> 02:13:29.231]  No, the globalist social engineers are the author.
[02:13:30.411 --> 02:13:33.013]  And if the public ever figures that out, it's game over.
[02:13:33.792 --> 02:13:34.852]  Game over, man!
[02:13:34.892 --> 02:13:35.573]  Game over!
[02:13:36.293 --> 02:13:37.753]  And that's why they're pulling out all the stops.
[02:13:38.033 --> 02:13:40.354]  And I know they've miscalculated speeding up their time frame.
[02:13:41.875 --> 02:13:42.875]  Game over, man!
[02:13:43.115 --> 02:13:43.535]  Game over!
[02:13:43.555 --> 02:13:45.136]  Yeah, it's game over to the Globalist.
[02:13:45.716 --> 02:13:56.179]  They have really pushed it so far and have lost the narrative and have really... They got a crude term for it about something to the pooch, but I'm not going to say it.
[02:13:57.970 --> 02:14:02.533]  I said it yesterday, the dog won't hunt, the bird won't fly, the boat won't float.
[02:14:03.074 --> 02:14:11.880]  I've looked at it, I've seen history, I don't care how much high-tech gadgetry you've got, how much propaganda you've got, how much poison you put in the water, humans are designed to adapt and overcome.
[02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:23.067]  And you may stun 50% of the public, but out of that other 50%, there's going to be a large percentage of those people that are going to actually get more intelligent, more vicious, more aggressive, under your attack.
[02:14:23.167 --> 02:14:25.189]  And all your studies show that, you fully know that.
[02:14:26.676 --> 02:14:32.179]  So, there's very few globalists and hundreds of millions of people worldwide that know exactly what's going on.
[02:14:32.579 --> 02:14:35.621]  And let me tell you, as you start putting the screws to people, there's going to be more.
[02:14:35.641 --> 02:14:36.461]  I want to go to your calls.
[02:14:36.521 --> 02:14:39.423]  Ron, Veteran, Kevin, Bob, and Brenda.
[02:14:39.443 --> 02:14:42.344]  We're going to go to all of you before Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us.
[02:14:43.465 --> 02:14:45.186]  Let me see who we should go to first.
[02:14:46.146 --> 02:14:50.749]  Again, DOD is designating Texas the enemy in training drills in the Southwest.
[02:14:51.849 --> 02:14:52.750]  Where should we go first?
[02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:54.671]  Let's go to Ron in Texas here on the air.
[02:14:56.178 --> 02:14:57.158]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:14:57.798 --> 02:14:59.619]  That's just all coming out in the open, brother.
[02:14:59.639 --> 02:15:00.319]  That's how I'm doing.
[02:15:01.439 --> 02:15:02.640]  Yeah, I hear you, man.
[02:15:02.700 --> 02:15:15.963]  Less than an hour ago, I was driving on I-10 and saw one of those black helicopters, no markings, stealth helicopters, fly over I-10, probably about 200 feet off the ground.
[02:15:16.603 --> 02:15:17.924]  Slow, real slow.
[02:15:19.804 --> 02:15:22.005]  And there's no military base around there.
[02:15:22.867 --> 02:15:27.068]  Yeah, what they're doing is, they admit, conditioning us for military occupation in the future.
[02:15:28.049 --> 02:15:33.711]  Yeah, because Texas is a, quote, hostile state, right?
[02:15:35.591 --> 02:15:38.412]  So, yeah, they're already doing it.
[02:15:39.172 --> 02:15:40.293]  It's already coming, man.
[02:15:40.433 --> 02:15:49.396]  Yeah, Texas wants prosperity and wealth and freedom and self-defense and security, and everybody's running from California and New York as fast as they can here, so we're the enemy.
[02:15:50.540 --> 02:15:51.200]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:51.501 --> 02:15:53.022]  Not that we're even that good.
[02:15:53.062 --> 02:15:54.903]  We're just not total scum.
[02:15:56.164 --> 02:15:56.504]  Right.
[02:15:57.005 --> 02:15:59.306]  And we don't lay down like California does.
[02:16:00.447 --> 02:16:01.068]  Well, they know.
[02:16:01.208 --> 02:16:06.232]  What really scares them is they know the Texas government, and I know this as well, is getting hardcore.
[02:16:07.192 --> 02:16:09.634]  Because they've all been brought in and told, join with the New World Order.
[02:16:09.654 --> 02:16:14.217]  And they're like, uh... I mean, they... The globalists are scared of Texas.
[02:16:14.518 --> 02:16:16.239]  Because Texas could lead the rest of the country.
[02:16:19.144 --> 02:16:19.985]  Yeah, they're scared.
[02:16:20.045 --> 02:16:22.447]  I mean, that's why they put us high priority.
[02:16:23.027 --> 02:16:24.609]  Hostile, hostile state.
[02:16:25.269 --> 02:16:27.951]  You know, that's why we're in the red, because they're scared of us.
[02:16:29.893 --> 02:16:36.218]  And they got Utah on there, too, because they know Utah's whole cosmology is about a globalist takeover and a federal takeover and how to fight it.
[02:16:37.159 --> 02:16:38.180]  And I mean, you know, good luck.
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:40.222]  I mean, Utah has infiltrated the entire government.
[02:16:40.982 --> 02:16:42.583]  I mean, the feds are scared of the Mormons.
[02:16:43.524 --> 02:16:43.865]  Good luck.
[02:16:43.885 --> 02:16:45.306]  The Mormons already infiltrated everything.
[02:16:46.603 --> 02:16:48.785]  I mean, the Patriots have infiltrated everything.
[02:16:48.805 --> 02:16:50.446]  I mean, the New World Order's got a big problem.
[02:16:50.487 --> 02:16:50.987]  God bless you.
[02:16:51.007 --> 02:16:51.948]  Appreciate your call, Ron.
[02:16:52.428 --> 02:16:53.729]  Rob in Missouri.
[02:16:53.749 --> 02:16:54.370]  You're on the air.
[02:16:54.430 --> 02:16:54.870]  Go ahead.
[02:16:55.811 --> 02:16:56.572]  Hi, Alex.
[02:16:56.792 --> 02:16:58.193]  For once, I'm actually on topic.
[02:16:58.213 --> 02:17:14.587]  This is a companion memorandum that I actually sent to Showtips at InfoWars just today, and it is Department of Defense Instruction Memorandum Number 132228, Realistic Military Training Off Federal Real Property.
[02:17:15.217 --> 02:17:32.226]  It's a 21-page document that I sent to you, and the interesting thing is on page 21, they're assessing the risk levels, and the risk levels are based upon media visibility and the possibility of legal liability from low to extremely high.
[02:17:33.026 --> 02:17:44.772]  And extremely high says loss of ability to complete training or probability of the occurrence of a significant negative incident, probably meaning media exposure, negative media exposure and so forth.
[02:17:44.932 --> 02:17:47.058]  Sure, they mentioned that a little bit in the other document.
[02:17:47.419 --> 02:17:49.766]  They're talking about coverage, people seeing it for what it is.
[02:17:50.368 --> 02:17:52.654]  Absolutely, and part of the PSYOP is how to counter that.
[02:17:53.717 --> 02:17:55.818]  Guys, look up Pentagon Memorandum 13228.
[02:17:58.340 --> 02:17:59.340]  What's the specific header?
[02:17:59.380 --> 02:17:59.841]  Is it U.S.
[02:17:59.881 --> 02:18:04.623]  Army Special Operations Command and Unclassified F-O-U-O?
[02:18:05.004 --> 02:18:05.564]  Something like that.
[02:18:05.604 --> 02:18:10.207]  Realistic Military Training R-M-T Off Federal Real Property.
[02:18:10.307 --> 02:18:11.968]  Department of Defense Instruction number 132228.
[02:18:14.049 --> 02:18:15.630]  Department of Defense Instruction.
[02:18:15.710 --> 02:18:16.490]  I got that off C-C-I-C dot mil.
[02:18:16.891 --> 02:18:17.531]  Okay, yeah.
[02:18:18.352 --> 02:18:18.832]  Anything else?
[02:18:20.911 --> 02:18:25.312]  Why do you think they list Texas and Utah?
[02:18:26.012 --> 02:18:32.054]  Well, because that's probably where they have the highest incidence of preppers and people that are actually prepared and awake and know what's going on.
[02:18:33.554 --> 02:18:39.096]  I have a lot of my family that's Mormon, and they generally recommend they have at least a year's supply of food.
[02:18:39.836 --> 02:18:40.716]  So there's the bottom line.
[02:18:40.796 --> 02:18:42.617]  Anybody self-sufficient is the enemy.
[02:18:43.657 --> 02:18:43.857]  Right.
[02:18:44.297 --> 02:18:46.058]  Anybody not on welfare is the enemy.
[02:18:46.918 --> 02:18:47.358]  Exactly.
[02:18:48.177 --> 02:18:49.018]  Alright, thank you Rob.
[02:18:49.038 --> 02:18:49.919]  Let's jam in one more.
[02:18:49.979 --> 02:18:50.900]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:52.421]  What's your take on this as a vet?
[02:18:53.962 --> 02:18:55.003]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:18:55.284 --> 02:18:55.864]  I'm doing alright.
[02:18:56.965 --> 02:18:57.706]  Thank you for what you do.
[02:18:57.726 --> 02:19:11.859]  Hey listen, you know, he's right on, you guys are right on with this whole thing because, you know, what they're going to do is they're going to come in here and they're going to show us that they're just going to violate posse comitatus right in our faces.
[02:19:13.385 --> 02:19:19.550]  Okay, they're going to try and get us to acquiesce to that, and they're going to make us think that we have to.
[02:19:21.692 --> 02:19:22.393]  You know, they're going to show.
[02:19:22.413 --> 02:19:23.854]  They're going to be rubbing this in our faces.
[02:19:23.894 --> 02:19:24.635]  This is crazy.
[02:19:25.175 --> 02:19:28.418]  Everybody should be out protesting this, and there's... I'm in California.
[02:19:28.838 --> 02:19:29.419]  I'm sorry.
[02:19:29.439 --> 02:19:30.960]  I was born and raised here.
[02:19:31.361 --> 02:19:32.982]  You know, it used to be a beautiful place.
[02:19:33.082 --> 02:19:35.264]  We used to have gun ranges all over the place.
[02:19:35.304 --> 02:19:36.025]  We used to go shooting.
[02:19:36.085 --> 02:19:36.845]  I grew up shooting.
[02:19:36.905 --> 02:19:38.587]  It's crazy what's happened here.
[02:19:38.827 --> 02:19:40.569]  The laws have just gone completely
[02:19:41.329 --> 02:19:41.749]  Oh, right.
[02:19:42.209 --> 02:19:43.310]  In a big way.
[02:19:43.370 --> 02:19:47.532]  Well, that's what you do first is you capture both the coastlines and then you take over the country.
[02:19:47.812 --> 02:19:50.233]  You invade from the south using third world populations.
[02:19:50.793 --> 02:19:51.453]  I mean, that's it.
[02:19:51.493 --> 02:19:52.854]  You shut off the energy sources.
[02:19:52.894 --> 02:19:54.335]  You divide the people that are in the country.
[02:19:54.375 --> 02:19:54.775]  You win.
[02:19:54.795 --> 02:19:56.095]  That's how you take down a nation.
[02:19:56.115 --> 02:19:57.756]  We're seeing a military PSYOP take over.
[02:19:58.096 --> 02:20:01.858]  And again, the PSYOPs pointed at the military to condition them this is all normal.
[02:20:02.438 --> 02:20:05.920]  Remember, the globalists say their number one enemy is the military.
[02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:07.120]  Kevin, stay there.
[02:20:07.140 --> 02:20:08.141]  I want you to finish up your point.
[02:20:08.161 --> 02:20:09.001]  We'll go to Brenda and others.
[02:20:09.798 --> 02:20:10.358]  Hear that?
[02:20:10.999 --> 02:20:15.260]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[02:20:16.381 --> 02:20:18.782]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[02:20:19.322 --> 02:20:22.384]  You can prevent being the next victim of a break-in.
[02:20:22.864 --> 02:20:30.047]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[02:20:30.427 --> 02:20:34.849]  Security is a mindset and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[02:20:35.029 --> 02:20:37.010]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[02:20:37.470 --> 02:20:37.891]  Faketv.com
[02:20:39.642 --> 02:20:40.703]  It's happening again.
[02:20:40.803 --> 02:20:44.005]  The Feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[02:20:44.405 --> 02:20:47.607]  In January, a newly introduced bill, H.R.
[02:20:47.828 --> 02:20:51.690]  378, will take away your right to buy level 3 and higher body armor.
[02:20:51.890 --> 02:20:56.914]  Katie Armor offers the most affordable level 3 body armor packages on the market today.
[02:20:57.394 --> 02:20:58.335]  Protect yourself.

[02:21:01.617 --> 02:21:03.238]  Go to KatieArmor.com.
[02:21:03.298 --> 02:21:05.699]  That's K-A-T-I-Armor.com.
[02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:07.361]  Come and take it.
[02:21:09.162 --> 02:21:14.924]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[02:21:15.244 --> 02:21:19.545]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[02:21:44.175 --> 02:21:47.757]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:21:48.097 --> 02:21:54.320]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:21:54.720 --> 02:21:59.705]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[02:22:09.122 --> 02:22:17.927]  As the New World Order continues to tighten its grip on every facet of our lives, we're all asking ourselves, how can we maintain our independence?
[02:22:18.728 --> 02:22:19.828]  The answer is clear.
[02:22:20.289 --> 02:22:22.290]  Get prepared and you get prepared now.
[02:22:22.890 --> 02:22:25.432]  Now the only question left is where do we begin?
[02:22:26.332 --> 02:22:28.153]  MyPatriotSupply is here to help.
[02:22:28.594 --> 02:22:35.419]  Call 800-247-3070 to get started with your 72-hour emergency food supply for only $10.
[02:22:35.459 --> 02:22:38.401]  We're even covering the cost of shipping.
[02:22:38.941 --> 02:22:43.164]  Are you willing to rely on the government and FEMA in the event of an emergency?
[02:22:44.105 --> 02:22:50.810]  Call 800-274-3070 to get started with your 72-hour emergency food supply for only $10.
[02:22:52.051 --> 02:22:57.435]  You won't be able to find this deal online, and there is a strict limit of 4 per caller, so don't wait!
[02:22:57.715 --> 02:22:58.416]  Call now!
[02:22:58.436 --> 02:22:58.596]  800-274-3070.
[02:22:58.656 --> 02:22:58.836]  That's 800-274-3070.
[02:22:58.856 --> 02:22:59.236]  Call right now!
[02:23:08.653 --> 02:23:14.835]  Usually, the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[02:23:15.396 --> 02:23:19.157]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[02:23:19.777 --> 02:23:22.738]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[02:23:23.279 --> 02:23:23.859]  Not fun!
[02:23:24.419 --> 02:23:32.222]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[02:23:32.802 --> 02:23:37.564]  One World Whey is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[02:23:37.904 --> 02:23:38.724]  My name is Errol.
[02:23:39.065 --> 02:23:40.405]  I'm 74 years old.
[02:23:40.605 --> 02:23:43.007]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[02:23:43.167 --> 02:23:50.650]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your Trace Mineral Supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[02:23:51.031 --> 02:23:57.094]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[02:23:57.334 --> 02:23:57.614]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:23:57.634 --> 02:23:57.994]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:23:58.014 --> 02:23:59.095]  Or visit oneworldwhey.com.
[02:24:19.409 --> 02:24:26.851]  Alright, Kevin in California, you were finishing up your point.
[02:24:26.891 --> 02:24:27.711]  I'm going to go to Veteran.
[02:24:29.351 --> 02:24:33.392]  Clarence, Tom, John, I think Becky are hung up.
[02:24:33.713 --> 02:24:34.333]  Kevin, go ahead.
[02:24:34.473 --> 02:24:35.113]  Thanks for calling.
[02:24:36.403 --> 02:24:45.296]  Yes, Alex, I was just going to say, first off, real quick, I was just going to say, to see how minuscule, how little it is, I mean, I'm in a little place here.
[02:24:45.316 --> 02:24:46.518]  I live in...
[02:24:47.955 --> 02:24:48.915]  California, bruh.
[02:24:49.235 --> 02:24:50.236]  Just like AJ said.
[02:24:50.376 --> 02:24:51.916]  I'm right down the street from AJ.
[02:24:52.876 --> 02:24:57.978]  So, uh, but listen, um, I see, and I've taken pictures of these vehicles.
[02:24:58.378 --> 02:25:02.759]  There's a building that they've occupied around the corner here, and it hasn't been occupied for a long time.
[02:25:03.579 --> 02:25:05.019]  And I started seeing these weird cars.
[02:25:05.099 --> 02:25:08.140]  It's had DOT, LADOT plates on them.
[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:11.861]  So I found out that's Los Angeles Department of Transportation.
[02:25:12.341 --> 02:25:15.022]  I looked at the placard inside, and I took pictures of it.
[02:25:15.823 --> 02:25:16.926]  And I have them.
[02:25:17.006 --> 02:25:22.877]  The placard says United States Federal Government Healthcare Law Enforcement Services.
[02:25:23.919 --> 02:25:25.823]  And then there's another badge in there that says HSI.
[02:25:28.494 --> 02:25:38.718]  And these guys are running around, you know, in this class it looks like, in their little Chevy, vehicles outfitted with police lights the whole nine yards.
[02:25:39.499 --> 02:25:44.901]  They have unlimited fiat money backed up by our taxpaying money and they are just proliferating the takeover.
[02:25:45.301 --> 02:25:46.422]  It's agenda 21.
[02:25:46.802 --> 02:25:48.382]  It is hellish what they're planning.
[02:25:48.742 --> 02:25:50.603]  Send us the photos and a brief write-up.
[02:25:50.663 --> 02:25:51.804]  We'll use your name if you want it.
[02:25:52.044 --> 02:25:53.905]  We'll do a story about it that's very newsworthy.
[02:25:54.265 --> 02:25:56.065]  Showtips at InfoWars.com.
[02:25:56.566 --> 02:25:57.046]  Amazing.
[02:25:57.726 --> 02:25:59.928]  In fact, I'm aware of those forces they're preparing.
[02:26:00.388 --> 02:26:05.872]  They're getting contingency plans for collapse, mercenaries at social security offices.
[02:26:06.232 --> 02:26:07.793]  They're gearing up for something big, folks.
[02:26:07.833 --> 02:26:08.814]  Thank you so much, Kevin.
[02:26:09.314 --> 02:26:12.617]  And they know Texas won't go along with a gun confiscation, or Utah.
[02:26:12.857 --> 02:26:14.678]  We're going to be invaded.
[02:26:14.718 --> 02:26:15.739]  They want to start a civil war.
[02:26:17.260 --> 02:26:18.961]  We're like French that didn't go along with Hitler.
[02:26:18.981 --> 02:26:19.702]  We're the bad people.
[02:26:20.421 --> 02:26:21.322]  We're the terrorists, folks.
[02:26:21.342 --> 02:26:22.683]  They're going to blow stuff up and say we did it.
[02:26:23.184 --> 02:26:24.866]  Veteran in California as well.
[02:26:25.306 --> 02:26:26.307]  What's your take on this?
[02:26:26.508 --> 02:26:28.470]  You want to bring up multi-state military training?
[02:26:28.810 --> 02:26:31.533]  I mean, that's admittedly coordinated between eight states.
[02:26:32.114 --> 02:26:33.535]  Admittedly for America.
[02:26:33.595 --> 02:26:34.376]  It's unprecedented.
[02:26:34.396 --> 02:26:34.697]  Go ahead.
[02:26:36.536 --> 02:26:38.417]  Hey Alex, be careful.
[02:26:38.717 --> 02:26:40.878]  I think you're coming out here in about a week.
[02:26:40.998 --> 02:26:45.221]  You're coming out to the insurgent pocket of Southern California.
[02:26:45.261 --> 02:26:48.382]  Well, I want to welcome you in about a week's time to the insurgent pocket.
[02:26:48.403 --> 02:26:48.723]  That's right.
[02:26:48.743 --> 02:26:51.464]  There's only an insurgent area in Orange County there.
[02:26:51.704 --> 02:26:52.945]  They list that as terrorists as well.
[02:26:53.145 --> 02:26:56.287]  Can you believe they list conservative libertarian areas as terrorists?
[02:26:57.611 --> 02:26:59.312]  I think it's Orange County and San Diego.
[02:26:59.352 --> 02:27:03.296]  It's the southern part of Southern California where you have a lot of veterans.
[02:27:03.316 --> 02:27:04.697]  Let's show them a document cam shot, guys.
[02:27:04.717 --> 02:27:06.518]  You know, that's a point you make.
[02:27:06.558 --> 02:27:08.040]  I guess that's the only conservative area.
[02:27:10.261 --> 02:27:13.204]  Well, it could be, but you know what?
[02:27:13.304 --> 02:27:24.033]  I think as this thing progresses, they're probably going to war game stuff to make places with lots of veterans, like various places in Arizona and maybe even New Mexico.
[02:27:24.073 --> 02:27:25.334]  They're going to become
[02:27:26.354 --> 02:27:33.538]  They're going to start to turn red, I'm sure, during this, you know, if they run this little exercise like I think they would.
[02:27:33.758 --> 02:27:35.579]  I notice it's all inversed.
[02:27:35.659 --> 02:27:38.100]  They're calling the patriots the red.
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:39.460]  You're like, we're the commies.
[02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:40.421]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:27:41.601 --> 02:27:43.222]  Yeah, and here's the thing.
[02:27:43.262 --> 02:27:54.828]  I mean, you know, maybe it's not the folks that, maybe it's not the guys that would oppose the third term of Barack Obama, but maybe it's the folks that would oppose something like
[02:27:56.397 --> 02:28:06.863]  Actually, what they're drafting right now, which is, it's basically from the Department of Health and Human Services, it's the National Adult Immunization Plan.
[02:28:07.103 --> 02:28:07.383]  That's right.
[02:28:07.403 --> 02:28:15.348]  If you're going to go against that, maybe you need to be rounded up, or maybe... Sure, they can release a bioweapon or a simulant and use that.
[02:28:15.388 --> 02:28:17.089]  They've got a lot of ways to skin the Republic.
[02:28:18.723 --> 02:28:18.963]  Right.
[02:28:19.063 --> 02:28:37.354]  Well, anyways, actually, I found on the site that there's actually...it looks like we've got about, I think, three days left for those that want to make a public comment for or against this draft legislation that they're coming up with on the adult immunization plan.
[02:28:37.614 --> 02:28:37.934]  Who knows?
[02:28:38.014 --> 02:28:39.495]  Maybe you can make a contest out of it.
[02:28:42.610 --> 02:28:45.656]  Yes, I mean I knew that was going on, but send me a link to the public comment.
[02:28:45.736 --> 02:28:46.959]  I guess that'd be with the FDA.
[02:28:50.485 --> 02:28:58.907]  No, it's the Department of Health and Human Services, and it's not quite easy to get to.
[02:28:59.268 --> 02:29:02.328]  Send me a link to ShowTipsAndInfoWars.com.
[02:29:02.368 --> 02:29:02.789]  Thank you, sir.
[02:29:03.069 --> 02:29:11.371]  Veteran, but imagine if 20 years ago you were told they'll have military drills to suppress the population and list libertarian conservative areas as enemies.
[02:29:11.811 --> 02:29:13.232]  I mean, this is so illegal!
[02:29:13.332 --> 02:29:14.652]  I mean, it's so evil!
[02:29:15.252 --> 02:29:17.713]  But who would have thought the President would open the borders up?
[02:29:19.801 --> 02:29:20.662]  It's happening.
[02:29:20.782 --> 02:29:21.262]  It's happening.
[02:29:23.583 --> 02:29:24.484]  Yeah, it sure is.
[02:29:24.584 --> 02:29:29.066]  And be careful, because you're going to be in a fellow red zone when you come out here in a week.
[02:29:31.567 --> 02:29:33.088]  I already live in the middle of the red zone.
[02:29:33.108 --> 02:29:33.749]  Are you kidding?
[02:29:34.913 --> 02:29:36.634]  Oh boy, I'm going to be speaking at Cal Jam.
[02:29:36.654 --> 02:29:38.434]  Most of the tickets have sold.
[02:29:38.454 --> 02:29:39.275]  There's still some left.
[02:29:39.875 --> 02:29:41.395]  The banner's on Infowars.com.
[02:29:41.455 --> 02:29:44.476]  You can sign up there as well and see the video stream of the two-day event.
[02:29:45.116 --> 02:29:46.197]  I promised a year ago to go.
[02:29:46.217 --> 02:29:48.938]  There's some great folks out there and it'll be good.
[02:29:49.098 --> 02:29:51.739]  I might be on Joe Rogan's podcast too when I'm out there if that lines up.
[02:29:52.219 --> 02:29:55.580]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back with our guests and more calls.
[02:29:56.020 --> 02:29:58.161]  We'll get Dr. Paul Craig Roberts' take on all this.
[02:29:58.601 --> 02:29:59.501]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.001 --> 02:30:01.502]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.525 --> 02:30:05.221]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.508 --> 02:30:10.729]  Another major health threat.
[02:30:10.769 --> 02:30:15.671]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:30:15.751 --> 02:30:18.372]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:30:18.412 --> 02:30:25.175]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:30:25.455 --> 02:30:28.316]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:30:28.456 --> 02:30:31.378]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:30:31.398 --> 02:30:33.379]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:30:33.419 --> 02:30:36.240]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:30:36.340 --> 02:30:41.842]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:30:42.062 --> 02:30:45.543]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.

[02:32:15.434 --> 02:32:19.738]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[02:33:20.666 --> 02:33:25.809]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:26.309 --> 02:33:28.650]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.271 --> 02:33:48.201]  We're going to be talking to our guest, former editor of the Wall Street Journal, father of economics, best-selling author, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former deputy head of the Department of Treasury, assistant secretary,
[02:33:49.275 --> 02:33:55.038]  We're going to talk about the huge developments in Russia, China, what's happening to the world economy, Federal Reserve announcements, and more.
[02:33:55.058 --> 02:33:57.679]  One of the top ten living economists, according to Forbes.
[02:33:58.259 --> 02:34:00.680]  Before we do that, please remember we're Lister-supported.
[02:34:00.700 --> 02:34:10.184]  We don't get $450 million a year like NPR, Rockefeller money, and then a bunch of other taxpayer money and beg for money every hour like NPR to push propaganda.
[02:34:10.545 --> 02:34:12.886]  We don't get billions of stimulus money like MSNBC.
[02:34:14.366 --> 02:34:16.488]  We sell high-quality Pro Second Amendment t-shirts.
[02:34:16.528 --> 02:34:17.768]  We sell high-quality supplements.
[02:34:17.808 --> 02:34:21.631]  We sell high-quality water filtration systems to cut out the glyphosates and fluoride.
[02:34:22.031 --> 02:34:23.753]  We sell high-quality shortwave radios.
[02:34:24.713 --> 02:34:29.517]  Really high-quality non-GMO seed banks for everything from fruit trees down to tomatoes.
[02:34:29.577 --> 02:34:31.058]  I mean, just the very best seed banks.
[02:34:31.298 --> 02:34:32.359]  Now's the time to get those.
[02:34:32.799 --> 02:34:38.343]  We have the major eight manufacturer suppliers of heirloom seeds that Monsanto and others have been trying to buy up.
[02:34:38.403 --> 02:34:39.584]  We have the lowest prices.
[02:34:40.164 --> 02:34:41.986]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:34:43.354 --> 02:34:48.221]  Now I advertise everything on the site at the lowest level you're allowed to sell stuff from distributors.
[02:34:48.242 --> 02:34:49.223]  They make you sign contracts.
[02:34:49.263 --> 02:34:53.089]  But I have in the contracts that twice a year I can offer discounts.
[02:34:54.070 --> 02:34:56.333]  And the contracts all pretty much agree 10 to 15 percent.
[02:34:58.188 --> 02:35:00.069]  And I push it a little bit, I'll be quite honest with you.
[02:35:28.789 --> 02:35:33.393]  And that's on top of stuff like DNA Force and other amazing supplements that are already 30% off.
[02:35:33.773 --> 02:35:38.818]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:35:38.838 --> 02:35:42.962]  And I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:35:42.982 --> 02:35:47.826]  You fund the operation and for supporting our local AM and FM affiliates and their sponsors as well.
[02:35:48.487 --> 02:35:58.969]  Now, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts was the former Assistant Secretary of State, the former head editor of the Wall Street Journal, and of course the best-selling author on many of the top think tanks in Washington as well.
[02:35:59.329 --> 02:36:01.670]  So he's, you know, a big former insider.
[02:36:03.050 --> 02:36:09.131]  And he has talked a lot about the fact that there is insanity by the ruling elite.
[02:36:09.631 --> 02:36:13.132]  He was involved in the collapse of the Soviet Union and negotiating that with them.
[02:36:14.348 --> 02:36:16.489]  He's warned that Russia may use nuclear weapons.
[02:36:16.509 --> 02:36:23.291]  Well, they came out Putin last week and said that we were preparing to use nuclear weapons if you continue to send in armor to attack us.
[02:36:24.132 --> 02:36:28.813]  Cracks in Washington's empire, Washington's EU vassals might be finding their backbone.
[02:36:29.373 --> 02:36:41.578]  Roberts reported on this on the 18th, a day later, it was in AP, Reuters, everywhere, basically the same headline that a whole bunch of countries, Switzerland, Luxembourg, South Korea, Japan, Australia,
[02:36:42.578 --> 02:36:45.385]  And others joined.
[02:36:48.217 --> 02:36:54.502]  And also Britain, Germany, France, and Italy to get into the Chinese-led Asian Investment Bank.
[02:36:54.802 --> 02:36:56.964]  But some of the elite over here are investing as well.
[02:36:57.464 --> 02:36:58.445]  So this is a big deal.
[02:36:58.465 --> 02:37:04.250]  It's a challenge to the IMF and World Bank, to dollar hegemon that the globalists have been using to abuse U.S.
[02:37:04.330 --> 02:37:09.054]  power, and really destroying it long term in the process, and destroying our soft power, to quote Roberts.
[02:37:09.334 --> 02:37:10.415]  So Roberts, I'm going to shut up.
[02:37:10.455 --> 02:37:14.818]  You've got the floor for the next ten minutes or so, and I'll come back in with some other areas I want to get into.
[02:37:16.479 --> 02:37:21.481]  It does look like some of the first cracks in the bravada, in the chutzpah.
[02:37:22.001 --> 02:37:24.823]  How big a deal are Putin's announcements about nukes?
[02:37:25.723 --> 02:37:28.324]  And how big a deal is the situation?
[02:37:29.104 --> 02:37:32.586]  And how does that tie into Yellen saying we may raise rates a little?
[02:37:32.626 --> 02:37:33.446]  What's really going on?
[02:37:35.418 --> 02:37:38.620]  Well, as you know, Alex, a great deal is going on.
[02:37:40.521 --> 02:37:52.029]  The Chinese, by bringing out this new Asian investment bank, are in the process of displacing Washington's Asian Development Bank.
[02:37:53.257 --> 02:38:07.801]  Washington uses development banks, whether the Asian one or the World Bank or other of its financial creatures such as IMF, to impose its financial and political hegemony on other countries.
[02:38:08.601 --> 02:38:10.122]  China is much more clever.
[02:38:11.022 --> 02:38:17.624]  And it's created this new bank in order to actually help countries and build friendships and to build trust.
[02:38:18.404 --> 02:38:20.164]  And no one can trust Washington.
[02:38:20.424 --> 02:38:26.326]  They know that it's a bully and that whatever it holds out to you, it's just a harness to put you in.
[02:38:27.146 --> 02:38:31.847]  So the surprising development was the rapidity
[02:38:33.041 --> 02:38:40.164]  With which American puppet states like Great Britain, I mean Great Britain is a total American puppet state.
[02:38:41.025 --> 02:38:45.847]  They never make a decision without asking Washington what they should decide.
[02:38:45.887 --> 02:38:51.290]  And yet Britain accepted this despite Washington's warning and opposition.
[02:38:51.390 --> 02:38:53.871]  So did France, Germany, and Italy.
[02:38:54.731 --> 02:39:06.859]  And then Australia and South Korea, which initially had turned down the Chinese invitation to join as a result of Washington's pressure on them, are now reconsidering.
[02:39:06.879 --> 02:39:08.360]  What's precipitating this?
[02:39:09.720 --> 02:39:17.625]  I think what's precipitating it is Washington is now so reckless.
[02:39:18.586 --> 02:39:20.707]  It's so full of arrogance and hubris.
[02:39:21.027 --> 02:39:23.229]  It really is a megalomaniac.
[02:39:24.292 --> 02:39:36.780]  And the world is beginning to realize that they're under threat of destruction by the incessant lies coming out of Washington about war, particularly with regard to Russia and to China.
[02:39:37.381 --> 02:39:47.327]  These incessant lies about Russian invasions of Ukraine, about a pending Russian invasion of the Baltics and Poland.
[02:39:47.468 --> 02:39:53.872]  And they realize that Washington is so out of control in its own mind
[02:39:54.952 --> 02:39:56.753]  That it's power is slipping.
[02:39:57.414 --> 02:40:03.397]  That it's going to drive the whole world into a war in order to try to prevent the rise of Russia and China.
[02:40:03.857 --> 02:40:10.120]  And so they're showing a move away from this control.
[02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:11.441]  They're trying to show that
[02:40:12.501 --> 02:40:18.504]  The empire's alliances are shaking, and that Washington needs to pull in its horns and back off.
[02:40:19.025 --> 02:40:21.326]  I think that's really what's going on.
[02:40:21.966 --> 02:40:32.212]  In addition, the financial interests in those countries have to be disturbed by the massive creation of money and debt in the United States.
[02:40:32.292 --> 02:40:37.995]  You know, the money and debt in the last six or seven years has grown many multiples.
[02:40:38.855 --> 02:40:44.241]  Times greater than the gross domestic product that has to support that money in debt.
[02:40:44.321 --> 02:40:51.990]  And so the whole notion of Washington as some sort of a financial safe house is diminishing.
[02:40:52.631 --> 02:40:59.259]  When you look at China, it is really the only country in the world that has massive independent reserves.
[02:41:01.068 --> 02:41:04.651]  It's the soundest financial system there is.
[02:41:05.411 --> 02:41:16.580]  And so I think they're saying, hey, look, we better remember that we can go down with the Americans if we don't make some sort of hedge against our American bet.
[02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:18.581]  And those hedges can expand quickly.
[02:41:18.641 --> 02:41:21.863]  Putin's now called for a Eurasian currency union as well.
[02:41:22.383 --> 02:41:32.549]  So this saber-rattling is forcing people out of very compliant stance they were in just six years ago into a obstinate stance.
[02:41:33.749 --> 02:41:35.290]  You summed it up very well, Alex.
[02:41:35.370 --> 02:41:36.611]  It's exactly what's happening.
[02:41:38.513 --> 02:41:39.694]  What's wrong with Washington?
[02:41:39.714 --> 02:41:42.695]  Because it's now national news, Roger Ford picked it up.
[02:41:42.776 --> 02:41:58.305]  Official Army document, it's public, says they list conservative areas, libertarian areas of California, Texas, and Utah as areas they think might have an uprising, and they're having a joint forces command training to take on domestic groups.
[02:42:00.125 --> 02:42:03.146]  And they list Texas as an enemy hostile.
[02:42:03.206 --> 02:42:06.147]  I mean, this is reaching Twilight Zone proportions.
[02:42:06.487 --> 02:42:10.069]  Who in the world would train the Pentagon and then publicly put out?
[02:42:10.089 --> 02:42:13.470]  I mean, we know the Pentagon had plans to invade Canada, but that doesn't mean they're going to do it.
[02:42:13.510 --> 02:42:20.012]  But they're actually training in huge military operations coming up this summer to basically invade Texas.
[02:42:22.675 --> 02:42:25.099]  You mean in the event of instability?
[02:42:25.180 --> 02:42:25.781]  Yes.
[02:42:25.881 --> 02:42:28.044]  Collapse and some sort of, yeah.
[02:42:28.765 --> 02:42:31.069]  Well, we'll find out how tough Texans are.
[02:42:32.981 --> 02:42:34.521]  You know, Texas is a big place.
[02:42:35.842 --> 02:42:37.182]  Kind of like Afghanistan.
[02:42:37.442 --> 02:42:46.144]  And if after 14 years, Washington couldn't defeat a few thousand lightly armed Taliban, it's not likely to defeat Texas.
[02:42:47.184 --> 02:42:48.404]  But we'll see what happens.
[02:42:50.625 --> 02:42:55.446]  Clearly, as you say, Washington is insane.
[02:42:55.586 --> 02:42:56.446]  They're unstable.
[02:42:56.466 --> 02:42:57.546]  They're mentally unstable.
[02:42:57.646 --> 02:42:59.046]  They're not just psychopaths.
[02:42:59.086 --> 02:43:02.547]  Well, clearly they're insane, drawing up war plans on Texas.
[02:43:04.045 --> 02:43:05.745]  And Utah.
[02:43:06.105 --> 02:43:12.227]  Look, what does, for example, what does Utah Senator Orrin Hatch think about this?
[02:43:13.447 --> 02:43:14.868]  There's never anything out of any of them.
[02:43:15.708 --> 02:43:18.208]  War plans against his home state.
[02:43:18.268 --> 02:43:20.529]  What do the Texas senators think?
[02:43:20.549 --> 02:43:22.449]  What does George W. Bush think?
[02:43:23.490 --> 02:43:24.830]  There he is sitting in Texas.
[02:43:26.761 --> 02:43:31.224]  And Washington is drawing up plans to invade Texas.
[02:43:32.104 --> 02:43:33.325]  Will he be a victim too?
[02:43:33.885 --> 02:43:45.831]  Well, remember three years ago when the legislature passed in the House unanimously that they would indict people for groping at the TSA and then they, before it passed the Senate, it was in the AP, they said we'll put F-16s in and embargo aircraft.
[02:43:46.132 --> 02:43:50.134]  The immediate response was the same thing that started the Civil War, a blockade.
[02:43:50.454 --> 02:43:51.995]  That shows the hubris
[02:43:52.535 --> 02:43:55.037]  You used to be in Washington at the highest levels.
[02:43:55.317 --> 02:43:57.378]  How has it changed since you were at the highest levels?
[02:43:57.778 --> 02:43:59.139]  It's a different country, Alex.
[02:43:59.820 --> 02:44:00.780]  It's a different country.
[02:44:00.840 --> 02:44:05.283]  It's nothing like what it was like when I was there.
[02:44:05.303 --> 02:44:07.965]  I mean, not that it was any kind of idealistic place.
[02:44:08.525 --> 02:44:14.929]  There was a lot of corruption and cowardice and scheming and illegality and immorality.
[02:44:15.590 --> 02:44:18.832]  But compared to what it is now, it was like heaven.
[02:44:20.578 --> 02:44:21.920]  There's no...
[02:44:30.404 --> 02:44:32.126]  Well, he never would have done any of this stuff.
[02:44:32.446 --> 02:44:36.210]  He respected the Oval Office, he respected the Constitution.
[02:44:37.792 --> 02:44:48.503]  The kind of bad things he got roped into doing was part of forcing the Soviets to negotiate the end of the Cold War.
[02:44:49.023 --> 02:44:51.466]  For example, Granada, Nicaragua.
[02:44:52.746 --> 02:45:04.948]  The neocons in the government, before he fired them, told him that you can't let there be a left-wing takeover in the Caribbean or in Central America because it will encourage the Soviets.
[02:45:05.869 --> 02:45:09.309]  And you'll never get them to negotiate the end of the Cold War.
[02:45:09.349 --> 02:45:14.450]  Well, that was his main goal, to end the Cold War and to cure the stagflation.
[02:45:15.070 --> 02:45:18.331]  And he said you had to first fix the economy so you would have the
[02:45:18.951 --> 02:45:35.384]  As the head of policy at the Treasury, number two guy there, sitting down with Reagan, how are you able, over all of their objections, able to get him to take on your economic plan that did create one of the biggest booms we've seen in the last century?
[02:45:47.639 --> 02:45:52.382]  Well, actually, he took it on before he got into office as part of his campaign.
[02:45:52.443 --> 02:45:57.306]  And when he got there, he realized he was going to have a hard time getting it out of his government.
[02:45:57.666 --> 02:46:05.152]  And so he appointed me to get his program out of his own government so it could be voted on in Congress.
[02:46:06.293 --> 02:46:08.474]  So I didn't have to sell him on anything.
[02:46:08.534 --> 02:46:12.797]  He was already sold on it, and he put me in charge of it because he knew I was committed to it.
[02:46:13.398 --> 02:46:15.920]  What would Ronald Reagan think today if he was seeing all this?
[02:46:17.384 --> 02:46:21.106]  Oh, he would think that we had been taken over by the Nazis or something.
[02:46:22.747 --> 02:46:24.188]  He would be astonished.
[02:46:24.688 --> 02:46:27.450]  He wouldn't be able to understand it.
[02:46:27.590 --> 02:46:29.151]  This is not my country.
[02:46:29.992 --> 02:46:35.235]  You know, look, what the United States has been doing the entirety of the 21st century is murdering people.
[02:46:36.363 --> 02:46:39.785]  I mean, the United States has become murder incorporated.
[02:46:39.805 --> 02:46:41.105]  It murders people.
[02:46:41.145 --> 02:46:42.546]  All it does is murder people.
[02:46:43.346 --> 02:46:48.408]  Seven or eight countries have been repeatedly invaded, bombed, droned.
[02:46:48.689 --> 02:46:50.309]  Some of them are in total ruins.
[02:46:50.509 --> 02:46:54.971]  We're talking about millions of people are dead, maimed, or displaced.
[02:46:55.892 --> 02:46:56.912]  And it's ongoing now.
[02:46:56.932 --> 02:46:57.933]  They're starting on Russia.
[02:46:59.065 --> 02:47:01.086]  See, Ukraine is being sacrificed.
[02:47:01.286 --> 02:47:02.627]  I mean, it's a basket case.
[02:47:03.287 --> 02:47:06.749]  And it's all to stop the rise of Russia.
[02:47:07.329 --> 02:47:09.450]  We were going to get into this anyhow.
[02:47:09.470 --> 02:47:11.611]  Yeah, let's talk about Putin's statements.
[02:47:13.268 --> 02:47:19.694]  Well, initially Putin thought that Russia was now part of the West.
[02:47:20.134 --> 02:47:21.535]  We're part of you.
[02:47:21.556 --> 02:47:23.117]  We're going to get along with you.
[02:47:23.137 --> 02:47:25.719]  He got into the World Trade Organization.
[02:47:25.739 --> 02:47:28.742]  The G7 was expanded to the G8.
[02:47:30.103 --> 02:47:41.697]  Everything was fine until the United States went in, organized a coup in Kiev, threw out the elected government, put in a puppet government, essentially a Nazi government, that hates Russians.
[02:47:41.777 --> 02:47:49.666]  And they started killing Russians, destroying Russian war monuments, threatening the Russian populations in the eastern and southern Ukraine.
[02:47:50.467 --> 02:47:57.621]  And Putin realized that the Americans would use Ukraine to grab the Soviet naval base in Crimea.
[02:47:57.641 --> 02:47:59.304]  It's the only warm water port.
[02:47:59.985 --> 02:48:02.550]  And so he said, holy smoke, they're after us!
[02:48:03.678 --> 02:48:20.088]  And so he has been gradually catching on that this wasn't some kind of mistake that got away from the Americans, that this was an intention, and that the United States intends to turn Russia into a bastard state, just like everybody else.
[02:48:21.269 --> 02:48:24.191]  And he realizes that that's not going to happen.
[02:48:24.351 --> 02:48:26.112]  And so he keeps issuing warnings.
[02:48:26.152 --> 02:48:29.214]  They get stronger, and they get stronger, and they get stronger.
[02:48:30.047 --> 02:48:34.645]  And he's relying, I think perhaps mistakenly, but maybe not.
[02:48:35.979 --> 02:48:53.152]  He's relying on the main European powers such as Germany and France to realize that their populations, their life, their existence is being threatened by Washington by pushing them into a conflict situation with Russia.
[02:48:53.772 --> 02:49:01.198]  And so he's relying on the French and the Germans to simply leave NATO or put their foot down or start blocking
[02:49:01.838 --> 02:49:05.159]  The American aggression against Russia.
[02:49:05.539 --> 02:49:11.582]  It's very difficult for Washington to carry this on without the complicity of Europe.
[02:49:12.102 --> 02:49:15.603]  Well, the Germans lost 21 million people in World War II.
[02:49:15.623 --> 02:49:17.384]  That was just 65, 70 years ago.
[02:49:17.784 --> 02:49:19.124]  The Russians lost that same amount.
[02:49:19.485 --> 02:49:22.486]  You'd think it'd be fresh in their minds not to have a war with Russia.
[02:49:23.546 --> 02:49:24.546]  Well, I think it is.
[02:49:24.646 --> 02:49:28.508]  I think that's not what... I mean, a few of their crazy generals
[02:49:29.778 --> 02:49:45.583]  But other than that, the population is totally against this, you know, and many of the members of the German parliament, the former chancellors and political leaders have all come out telling Merkel, you really got to stop being Washington's puppet.
[02:49:45.643 --> 02:49:48.324]  We can't take these kinds of risks.
[02:49:48.364 --> 02:49:50.604]  It's not in the interest of Germany or Europe.
[02:49:50.624 --> 02:49:52.265]  You think they're blackmailing Merkel?
[02:49:53.652 --> 02:50:02.500]  Oh sure, of course they are, but there's no, you know, would you let somebody blackmail you if the consequence was going to be the destruction of a life on Earth?
[02:50:02.780 --> 02:50:02.981]  No!
[02:50:03.721 --> 02:50:03.981]  No.
[02:50:05.663 --> 02:50:07.845]  I think that she's just slow on the uptake.
[02:50:07.885 --> 02:50:11.668]  She's not, you know, it's not like she's some kind of genius.
[02:50:12.549 --> 02:50:24.442]  And so many people are inculcated into the American myth that we are the white hats and the salt of the earth and the exceptional and the indispensable and the good guys and blah blah blah.
[02:50:24.462 --> 02:50:26.765]  It takes them a while to see the reality.
[02:50:27.902 --> 02:50:36.533]  And we did see that Merkel and Hollande went to Russia to negotiate with Putin at the end of the Ukraine crisis.
[02:50:37.334 --> 02:50:39.797]  And they did that over Washington's objection.
[02:50:40.197 --> 02:50:44.262]  And you see every day that Washington is doing everything it possibly can.
[02:50:45.203 --> 02:50:52.668]  To upset the agreement that Merkel and Hollande... But you're saying overall things are going in a little bit better direction now.
[02:50:52.928 --> 02:50:55.149]  Correct me if I'm wrong, we come back from breaking the final segment.
[02:50:55.429 --> 02:51:04.535]  Then I want to ask you about the latest policy announcements out of the Federal Reserve on interest rates and just your brief take on the current climate in the economy.

[02:52:11.463 --> 02:52:16.307]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:52:16.567 --> 02:52:24.453]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:52:24.694 --> 02:52:28.997]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:52:29.217 --> 02:52:33.040]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:52:33.180 --> 02:52:38.904]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:52:39.124 --> 02:52:41.906]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:52:42.306 --> 02:52:47.510]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[02:54:08.914 --> 02:54:12.339]  In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance.
[02:54:12.920 --> 02:54:20.070]  The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[02:54:20.090 --> 02:54:22.353]  Well, we're gonna do everything we can to help.
[02:54:25.254 --> 02:54:28.737]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:54:29.318 --> 02:54:31.740]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:31.820 --> 02:54:36.164]  Because there is a war on in your mind.
[02:54:36.224 --> 02:54:38.105]  PaulCraigRoberts.org.
[02:54:38.946 --> 02:54:40.127]  Infowars.com.
[02:54:40.167 --> 02:54:41.188]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:54:41.848 --> 02:54:46.873]  I can just tell you, not being dramatic, there's a lot of stuff being done behind the scenes to mess with us, to shut us down.
[02:54:46.913 --> 02:54:48.894]  It's only intensifying our efforts.
[02:54:49.635 --> 02:54:51.196]  Thanks to your prayers and support out there.
[02:54:52.097 --> 02:54:53.860]  They really mess with a lot of folks.
[02:54:53.920 --> 02:54:55.803]  You need to understand, we really do have a tyranny.
[02:54:56.063 --> 02:55:00.730]  But you can't be scared of it and then think that cowering will make it all go away.
[02:55:01.291 --> 02:55:02.793]  Getting in its face will bring it down.
[02:55:03.670 --> 02:55:06.092]  And a lot of people in government are upset about what's happening.
[02:55:06.112 --> 02:55:11.457]  We had William Binney here in studio the other day, former director, technical director of the NSA.
[02:55:11.977 --> 02:55:14.820]  He says most people he talks to in government are totally freaked out and awake.
[02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:16.982]  So I don't see how long this can go.
[02:55:17.322 --> 02:55:28.352]  Dr. Roberts, finishing up on the state of the economy, the Federal Reserve's announcements, and just your gut feeling about are things starting to turn a little bit or are we still in really bad trouble?
[02:55:29.246 --> 02:55:30.307]  We're in really bad trouble.
[02:55:31.508 --> 02:55:34.411]  But first, Alex, let me finish up our prior conversation.
[02:55:34.531 --> 02:55:37.995]  I don't want to leave it on an optimistic foot.
[02:55:38.816 --> 02:55:48.906]  What's happening right now is the United States is busy with causing either coups or color revolutions in Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan.
[02:55:49.807 --> 02:55:54.231]  So, and they're renewing the conflict in Ukraine.
[02:55:54.271 --> 02:56:00.156]  Washington's doing everything it can to destroy the agreement that was achieved in Minsk.
[02:56:00.737 --> 02:56:03.319]  So, soon Russia is going to have four Ukraines.
[02:56:04.440 --> 02:56:11.486]  They're going to have it back in Ukraine, and they're going to have it in three countries along their underbelly border with Asia.
[02:56:12.381 --> 02:56:13.202]  Let's be clear.
[02:56:36.781 --> 02:56:45.847]  They then put people like Joe Biden's son over multi-billion dollar infrastructures, gas facilities and things to milk them.
[02:56:46.187 --> 02:56:48.348]  So it's a classical mafia tactic.
[02:56:48.549 --> 02:56:54.332]  They're not liberating these countries, they're coming in to destabilize them and steal Russian funded infrastructure.
[02:56:54.913 --> 02:57:01.177]  Well, they're going to do that, but the main purpose is to create instability for Russia.
[02:57:02.054 --> 02:57:08.616]  In order that Russia cannot rise as a power that can check American purposes.
[02:57:09.156 --> 02:57:14.517]  So if Russia's got four Ukraines on its border, it's completely used up.
[02:57:14.917 --> 02:57:17.238]  And it's no longer in America's way.
[02:57:17.978 --> 02:57:23.320]  And also the trouble they're causing in Uzbekistan, this can spill over into China.
[02:57:24.540 --> 02:57:34.926]  And so they can simultaneously cause trouble for Russia, for China, to get splits between Russia and China on how to deal with the issue because their interests differ somewhat in that part of the world.
[02:57:36.046 --> 02:57:41.109]  And so this is a very clever policy at destabilizing the other two rising powers.
[02:57:41.469 --> 02:57:43.950]  And I think it's going to lead to a major war.
[02:57:44.571 --> 02:57:47.092]  Now, that said, we can turn to the Fed.
[02:57:47.112 --> 02:57:49.253]  What the Fed has done
[02:57:51.957 --> 02:58:03.432]  First of all, the Fed is no longer an independent agency managing the economic policy on behalf of the country.
[02:58:03.492 --> 02:58:07.738]  They are a special interest group that represents four or five major banks.
[02:58:08.619 --> 02:58:14.247]  Banks deregulation, free market deregulation, that get too big to fail.
[02:58:14.427 --> 02:58:23.498]  And so the entirety of American economic policy since 2008 has had one single purpose, and that's to keep four big banks afloat.
[02:58:24.918 --> 02:58:35.085]  In order to keep those big banks afloat, they had to create trillions of new money in order to purchase the worthless assets that the banks... Sure.
[02:58:35.125 --> 02:58:39.868]  Doctor, do five more minutes with us in overdrive and put bookends on this, because it's so important.
[02:58:40.168 --> 02:58:43.950]  And then I want to go back in a minute or so and talk about this big war you're warning about.
[02:58:44.191 --> 02:58:46.272]  I'll be back Sunday, live, 4 to 6 p.m., folks.
[02:58:46.312 --> 02:58:47.032]  Be sure and be there.
[02:58:49.734 --> 02:58:50.895]  Back in 60 seconds, folks.
[02:58:51.826 --> 02:58:55.800]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:59.406 --> 02:59:02.909]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:59:03.049 --> 02:59:07.012]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:59:07.333 --> 02:59:08.794]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:59:09.114 --> 02:59:16.701]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:59:16.981 --> 02:59:17.822]  But for how long?
[02:59:18.122 --> 02:59:24.387]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:59:24.767 --> 02:59:27.570]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:59:28.991 --> 02:59:32.193]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:59:32.493 --> 02:59:40.518]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:59:40.758 --> 02:59:45.761]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:59:46.181 --> 02:59:48.443]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:59:48.703 --> 02:59:50.484]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[03:00:01.204 --> 03:00:07.470]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:10.453 --> 03:00:15.518]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:15.858 --> 03:00:18.161]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:00:20.683 --> 03:00:29.069]  Dr. Paul Greg Roberts, former head of policy at the Treasury Department, is an expert economist and can tell us what he sees going on with the Fed.
[03:00:29.109 --> 03:00:31.791]  Some countries are going below zero in interest rates.
[03:00:31.811 --> 03:00:33.052]  They're talking about going up a little bit.
[03:00:34.273 --> 03:00:37.936]  We see a lot of mainstream news admitting the economic outlook is grim.
[03:00:38.336 --> 03:00:40.718]  So, Dr. Roberts, give us your prognosis on that.
[03:00:41.258 --> 03:00:49.144]  Okay, they talk about maybe pushing interest rates up in order to make people a little more comfortable holding dollars.
[03:00:49.905 --> 03:00:56.310]  Because the whole world understands that you can't have massive creation of money and debt and negative interest rates.
[03:00:57.270 --> 03:01:03.495]  And so, when they talk about raising interest rates, it's just talk to try to block flight from the dollar.
[03:01:05.076 --> 03:01:05.757]  That's all it is.
[03:01:05.817 --> 03:01:10.581]  Because if they raise interest rates, the stock market's going to collapse, the bond market's going to collapse.
[03:01:12.526 --> 03:01:13.847]  And they've got chaos.
[03:01:15.047 --> 03:01:26.373]  When you've spent trillions of dollars to save four banks since 19, since 2008, these are the banks that deregulation allowed to get too large.
[03:01:26.994 --> 03:01:29.415]  And these are banks that gamble.
[03:01:29.515 --> 03:01:31.116]  They don't make normal loans.
[03:01:31.156 --> 03:01:32.917]  They gamble in a casino.
[03:01:33.317 --> 03:01:34.778]  And they don't cover their bets.
[03:01:34.858 --> 03:01:41.121]  The taxpayers cover the bets and the Federal Reserve covers the bets by printing money and buying the bad bets.
[03:01:42.386 --> 03:01:44.667]  And that's what American economic policy is.
[03:01:44.707 --> 03:01:46.848]  That's what the Fed is locked into.
[03:01:47.308 --> 03:01:48.849]  It really has no way to get out of it.
[03:01:49.969 --> 03:01:50.890]  It can't get out of it.
[03:01:52.670 --> 03:01:53.631]  And it's stuck with it.
[03:01:55.171 --> 03:01:58.833]  Because it wouldn't let the banks fail because the banks control the Fed.
[03:01:59.353 --> 03:02:03.255]  Look, who have the Secretaries of the Treasury been?
[03:02:05.143 --> 03:02:08.666]  It's the former banksters who caused the financial crisis.
[03:02:08.787 --> 03:02:11.729]  Every one of them have rotated through the Treasury.
[03:02:12.070 --> 03:02:14.111]  So they're protecting their own mistakes.
[03:02:14.932 --> 03:02:15.753]  Look at the Fed.
[03:02:15.773 --> 03:02:16.614]  What is the Fed?
[03:02:17.294 --> 03:02:18.335]  It's the same people.
[03:02:19.184 --> 03:02:20.505]  Look at the New York Fed.
[03:02:20.565 --> 03:02:23.088]  Who are the directors of the New York Fed?
[03:02:23.208 --> 03:02:24.469]  It's the same banks!
[03:02:24.969 --> 03:02:36.659]  Everybody at the Justice Department at the top is part of those lobbying groups and consulting groups that write the regulations and the policies and file the papers to let the big banks get away with the derivatives.
[03:02:36.699 --> 03:02:38.041]  I mean, it's just a revolving door.
[03:02:38.581 --> 03:02:42.805]  It's one small group, and they control the economic policy.
[03:02:42.825 --> 03:02:44.526]  So how are they going to take a decision
[03:02:45.407 --> 03:02:46.047]  I don't know.
[03:02:46.067 --> 03:02:46.207]  I mean...
[03:03:15.607 --> 03:03:25.854]  I don't know what it means, but what we do know is the country does not have an economic policy that serves the country or serves business or serves economic growth.
[03:03:27.065 --> 03:03:33.787]  You see, they tell you that the Fed's policy is designed to encourage the economy, but we don't see a recovery.
[03:03:34.107 --> 03:03:34.427]  Sure.
[03:03:34.947 --> 03:03:35.787]  There's no recovery.
[03:03:35.827 --> 03:03:39.388]  They make one up, but it's not because they don't count the unemployed people.
[03:03:39.929 --> 03:03:40.529]  It's amazing.
[03:03:40.589 --> 03:03:41.409]  It's just insanity.
[03:03:41.669 --> 03:03:51.532]  And the minute we have left, I don't know how these four or five megabanks think they're going to survive a nuclear war with Russia, but maybe they're so arrogant they think that they're immune from that.
[03:03:52.938 --> 03:04:00.561]  The neoconservatives think that the United States can win the nuclear war because our stuff is better than the Russians.
[03:04:01.382 --> 03:04:09.866]  And we have ABMs, anti-ballistic missiles, and so when the Russians try to retaliate to our first strike, they'll shoot their missiles down.
[03:04:10.746 --> 03:04:11.766]  So this is the myth.
[03:04:13.187 --> 03:04:16.489]  I'm reading a book now by, I think, Andrew Coleman.
[03:04:17.129 --> 03:04:17.629]  It's called
[03:04:19.790 --> 03:04:20.531]  What is it called?
[03:04:20.951 --> 03:04:21.471]  It doesn't matter.
[03:04:21.491 --> 03:04:31.378]  Anyhow, he shows that the United States has endless faith in technology as a way of conducting war.
[03:04:31.498 --> 03:04:32.419]  And it always fails.
[03:04:32.499 --> 03:04:33.559]  It has never worked.
[03:04:33.819 --> 03:04:34.060]  Ever.
[03:04:34.220 --> 03:04:35.300]  It didn't work as good.
[03:04:35.481 --> 03:04:42.245]  I mean, we know the Russians are going to have subs pop up with cruise missiles and blow up every... I mean, it's going to be an absolute disaster.
[03:04:42.565 --> 03:04:47.068]  Sure, we'll destroy them worse, but there's so many nukes it'll destroy the whole planet.
[03:04:47.108 --> 03:04:47.789]  It's insane!
[03:04:48.309 --> 03:04:48.930]  It's insane?
[03:04:49.890 --> 03:04:52.092]  But everybody in Washington is insane.
[03:04:52.172 --> 03:04:59.097]  You know, I have no confidence, Alex, that there's anybody in the government that has an ounce of integrity or an ounce of morality.
[03:04:59.177 --> 03:04:59.477]  It's scary.
[03:04:59.497 --> 03:05:01.519]  We're going to have to talk to you more about this in the future.
[03:05:01.539 --> 03:05:03.160]  Dr. Paul Gregg Roberts, thank you so much.
[03:05:03.220 --> 03:05:04.221]  Have a great weekend, sir.
[03:05:05.522 --> 03:05:10.926]  Kiss your grandchildren.
[03:05:10.966 --> 03:05:14.769]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[03:05:15.529 --> 03:05:17.551]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat
