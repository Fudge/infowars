[00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:13.390]  The joint meeting will come to order.
[00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.873]  Members of the committee on the part of the House to escort His Excellency Benjamin Netanyahu into the chamber.
[00:00:20.213 --> 00:00:34.500]  More pomp and circumstance in the nation's capital, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched into a worldwide call to arms against President Obama's deal with Iran, that it frees nuclear activities for at least 10 years.
[00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:41.384]  Iran's regime poses a grave threat, not only to Israel, but also to the peace of the entire world.
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:50.265]  So at a time when many hope that Iran will join the community of nations, Iran is busy gobbling up the nations.
[00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.948]  Iran's regime is as radical as ever.
[00:00:54.768 --> 00:01:00.352]  It's cries of death to America, that same America that it calls the Great Satan, as loud as ever.
[00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:10.559]  Now this shouldn't be surprising, because the ideology of Iran's revolutionary regime is deeply rooted in militant Islam.
[00:01:11.687 --> 00:01:15.428]  And that's why this regime will always be an enemy of America.
[00:01:16.528 --> 00:01:22.549]  The greatest danger facing our world is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons.
[00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.611]  To defeat ISIS and let Iran get nuclear weapons would be to win the battle, but lose the war.
[00:01:30.911 --> 00:01:33.312]  We can't let that happen.
[00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:48.987]  Now I know this is not going to come as a shock to any of you, but Iran not only defies inspectors, it also plays a pretty good game of hide and cheat with them.
[00:01:51.687 --> 00:02:02.950]  The UN's nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, said again yesterday that Iran still refuses to come clean about its military nuclear program.
[00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.411]  Iran was also caught twice, not once, twice.
[00:02:08.303 --> 00:02:14.747]  Operating secret nuclear facilities in Natanz and Qom, facilities that inspectors didn't even know existed.
[00:02:16.228 --> 00:02:20.631]  Right now, Iran could be hiding nuclear facilities that we don't know about.
[00:02:21.311 --> 00:02:34.079]  Israel's neighbors, Iran's neighbors, know that Iran will become even more aggressive and sponsor even more terrorism when its economy is unshackled and it's been given a clear path to the bomb.
[00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.100]  And many of these neighbors
[00:02:37.918 --> 00:02:42.160]  Say they'll respond by racing to get nuclear weapons of their own.
[00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:45.442]  So this deal won't change Iran for the better.
[00:02:46.482 --> 00:02:48.503]  It will only change the Middle East for the worse.
[00:02:49.844 --> 00:02:58.128]  A deal that's supposed to prevent nuclear proliferation would instead spark a nuclear arms race in the most dangerous part of the planet.
[00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.090]  This deal won't be a farewell to arms.
[00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.591]  It would be a farewell to arms control.
[00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:08.191]  And the Middle East would soon be crisscrossed by nuclear tripwires.
[00:03:09.892 --> 00:03:15.836]  A region where small skirmishes can trigger big wars would turn into a nuclear tinderbox.
[00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:27.044]  If anyone thinks, if anyone thinks this deal kicks the can down the road, think again.
[00:03:28.765 --> 00:03:33.088]  When we get down that road, we'll face a much more dangerous Iran,
[00:03:34.321 --> 00:03:42.885]  A Middle East littered with nuclear bombs and a countdown to a potential nuclear nightmare.
[00:03:44.886 --> 00:03:54.711]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've come here today to tell you we don't have to bet the security of the world on the hope that Iran will change for the better.
[00:03:55.952 --> 00:03:59.634]  We don't have to gamble with our future and with our children's future.
[00:04:00.714 --> 00:04:01.455]  We can insist
[00:04:03.137 --> 00:04:11.902]  That restrictions on Iran's nuclear program not be lifted for as long as Iran continues its aggression in the region and in the world.
[00:04:19.048 --> 00:04:30.213]  Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Havad Zarif has responded by calling Obama's deal unacceptable and is refusing to accept Obama's excessive and illogical demands.
[00:04:30.654 --> 00:04:39.158]  The United States has taken the initiative in the talks with Iran, representing five globalist powers, Britain, China, France, Germany, and Russia.
[00:04:39.398 --> 00:04:48.182]  As we near the next presidential election in 2016, expect the Iranian nuclear issue to be laterally pitched up the political football field.
[00:04:48.582 --> 00:05:01.113]  Once again, the American people are being fed globalist scare tactics that always lead down a dead-end street of failed policy, lies, and elitist posturing while bowing to their corporacratic masters.
[00:05:01.554 --> 00:05:08.039]  Remember when Netanyahu testified in 2002 that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction?
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.442]  There is no question whatsoever
[00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:17.572]  That Saddam is seeking and is working and is advancing towards the development of nuclear weapons.
[00:05:17.992 --> 00:05:19.572]  No question whatsoever.
[00:05:20.133 --> 00:05:24.975]  And there is no question that once he acquires it, history shifts immediately.
[00:05:25.355 --> 00:05:34.698]  A recent poll conducted by Al Jazeera America and Monmouth University reveals the demographics in our living and breathing culture of fear.
[00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:38.520]  48% disapprove of Barack Obama's job as president.
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.802]  70% disapprove of the job the U.S.
[00:05:41.862 --> 00:05:43.803]  Congress is doing.
[00:05:44.323 --> 00:05:49.005]  59% believe Iran will not abide by any nuclear agreement.
[00:05:49.566 --> 00:05:52.347]  75% think ISIS is a major threat to U.S.
[00:05:52.407 --> 00:05:53.408]  national security.
[00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:58.811]  45% expect a somewhat likely terroristic threat in the next few months.
[00:05:59.371 --> 00:06:02.132]  And 49% don't believe the U.S.
[00:06:02.212 --> 00:06:04.674]  is doing enough to curb these attacks.
[00:06:05.294 --> 00:06:13.456]  The minions of the New World Order always call for vigilance in the face of terror, as if it doesn't already exist in the United States.
[00:06:14.236 --> 00:06:25.098]  Our vigilance and unrelenting watch should be to avoid their globalist parlor tricks and focus on the few leaders that refuse to relinquish our Republic's founding principles.
[00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:34.220]  There may be a false flag incident where some ship goes down and you'd be used for the excuse to accelerate the next war.
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.422]  You've got a lot of factions in the military-industrial complex who want more war.
[00:06:37.442 --> 00:06:39.925]  You've got a lot of crazies in the Middle East who want more war.
[00:06:40.205 --> 00:06:46.690]  You've got Israel involved with the West, all guilty, like our military said two years ago, of arming al-Qaeda to attack Syria.
[00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:48.071]  A war crime!
[00:06:48.352 --> 00:06:49.272]  Killing Christians!
[00:06:49.793 --> 00:06:51.094]  I'm very angry with Israel.
[00:06:51.554 --> 00:06:53.056]  I'm very angry with our own government.
[00:06:53.356 --> 00:06:55.237]  I'm very angry with Turkey.
[00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:00.722]  See, I'm not especially angry with Israel, because I'm not...
[00:07:02.237 --> 00:07:03.139]  Mindless hater!
[00:07:03.821 --> 00:07:05.506]  John Barron for InfoWars.com
[00:07:15.674 --> 00:07:21.796]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:25.157]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:07:25.217 --> 00:07:26.837]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:07:26.897 --> 00:07:33.119]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:39.141]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking their hands down on the pants on the streets?
[00:07:39.301 --> 00:07:43.064]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:07:43.264 --> 00:07:46.166]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:07:46.186 --> 00:07:54.332]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:07:54.612 --> 00:07:56.654]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:07:56.714 --> 00:07:57.755]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:07:58.115 --> 00:08:06.864]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
