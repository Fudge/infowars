[00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:19.240]  I saw the InfoWars on feminism when Cytheria got gang raped and I was really upset about that.
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:28.123]  They were talking about how Anita Scorsese hasn't commented on it at all and I'm like, yeah,
[00:00:28.942 --> 00:00:30.843]  Her focus is really, like, Gamergate.
[00:00:32.304 --> 00:00:35.505]  But it's still part of, like, the bigger picture as a whole.
[00:00:35.725 --> 00:00:37.206]  And, like, it was kind of upsetting.
[00:00:37.226 --> 00:00:40.488]  And I'm just kind of like, hey, why didn't we talk about that?
[00:00:40.548 --> 00:00:43.969]  Like, why is there a big stigma around sex workers?
[00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:47.911]  And why did I find out about it through, like, sites like Chicks on the Right?
[00:00:47.951 --> 00:00:48.712]  Like, that was really...
[00:00:49.594 --> 00:00:50.154]  Surprising.
[00:00:50.235 --> 00:01:01.182]  And I don't like that it's been used to further perpetuate this negative connotation on the idea of what feminism is, which is equality.
[00:01:01.483 --> 00:01:03.044]  You have the feminists who think
[00:01:03.752 --> 00:01:17.824]  You know, they see the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover, they think it's a great celebration of women's bodies, fitness, and all that, and then you also have the other ones, or at least another type of feminist, if they call themselves, saying that it's objectifying and it's horrible and it's all these other things.
[00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:21.548]  Yeah, you know, I think there's something to be said about that.
[00:01:21.708 --> 00:01:28.654]  As a feminist, I identify, I don't think it's my personal responsibility to tell someone else
[00:01:29.114 --> 00:01:53.168]  Who they should be and what they should do and I really think it's defeating the purpose when we go around pointing out who's more feminist than the other person and like who's more like liberal or who's more you know right-wing or whatever like they just your guys are forgetting like the idea which is like it's supposed to be a quality and it's a humanist issue because it's yes America has pretty we're pretty free as far as females go and
[00:01:53.468 --> 00:02:00.032]  But there are people around the world, little girls, that get like sold into a marriage, like they're 7 years old.
[00:02:00.112 --> 00:02:05.855]  And then like you look at little boys, like the Quran talks about bedding little boys, it's like a common practice.
[00:02:06.456 --> 00:02:08.537]  You know, that's f***ed up!
[00:02:08.597 --> 00:02:10.218]  I'm not down with child trafficking.
[00:02:10.418 --> 00:02:12.179]  Right, and we talk about that stuff too.
[00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:18.463]  We talk about the rape and mutilation of women in the Middle East, Saudi Arabian women being called terrorists for being able to drive.
[00:02:18.683 --> 00:02:20.003]  Back to Cosmopolitan.
[00:02:20.023 --> 00:02:25.545]  Cosmopolitan represents a time right now where we're in a transitional period as a country.
[00:02:26.105 --> 00:02:29.686]  Women haven't had rights for very long and we're still in that transitional.
[00:02:29.746 --> 00:02:31.867]  It's not Star Trek where everybody's cool.
[00:02:32.187 --> 00:02:33.188]  Talking about Gamergate.
[00:02:33.408 --> 00:02:34.268]  Can you explain that to me?
[00:02:35.414 --> 00:02:46.866]  Um, well, as far as, as my understanding is that, like, Anita Skarzizian has started a conversation which is, um, there is sexual objectification of women in video games.
[00:02:47.327 --> 00:02:52.392]  And, you know, it anatomically doesn't make sense for a female warrior to have giant breasts.
[00:02:52.432 --> 00:02:54.394]  Like, you know, that's the deal.
[00:02:54.434 --> 00:02:55.815]  And I can, I can understand that.
[00:02:56.996 --> 00:03:02.660]  But, at the same time, it's like, you know, it's a freedom of expression as far as video games go.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:19.092]  And I do think that there needs to be more, like, positive video games for women, because, you know, it's not always about clothes, and it's really discouraging, I think, for little girls to just be constantly bombarded with, you know, take care of the baby doll, take care of your clothes.
[00:03:19.172 --> 00:03:20.653]  What about characters like Metroid?
[00:03:21.482 --> 00:03:25.868]  Characters like Metroid, yeah, like we need more strong female like characters.
[00:03:25.908 --> 00:03:29.854]  Basically from my understanding what you're saying is Gamergate was pretty much a way to get more
[00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:32.780]  Positive female characters in video games?
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:48.910]  No, GamerGate, they have a big issue because, to my understanding, she started a conversation about sexual objectification in women, and there was a backlash from the men of GamerGate and other video games.
[00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.150]  They had a big problem with it.
[00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.194]  They didn't like what she was starting, and then they decided to put her information out to the world.
[00:03:56.394 --> 00:03:58.055]  Her private, personal information.
[00:03:58.075 --> 00:03:59.496]  Okay, so that's where the gate came in.
[00:03:59.696 --> 00:04:24.250]  Yeah, well, and like, you know, as a person, like, if you were somebody and you just, like, wanted to talk about something on YouTube and, like, start a conversation about something, and then to have someone hack into your personal stuff and then put your information out there and then experience death threats on a 24-7 basis, like, she couldn't give a speech in a college because somebody said that they would, there would be a shooting worse than Kent State.
[00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.671]  That's, that's scary, that's
[00:04:26.271 --> 00:04:29.113]  Like okay, so that's what it was it wasn't so much what she was saying.
[00:04:29.173 --> 00:04:32.994]  It's like how people reacted to it Yeah, like it's not so much like you know.
[00:04:33.255 --> 00:04:38.297]  I don't think she's like campaigning to like You know come down on men.
[00:04:38.377 --> 00:04:39.698]  She's just asking hey.
[00:04:40.098 --> 00:04:43.159]  Can you really think about how you're treating me as a human being?
[00:04:52.052 --> 00:04:57.814]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
