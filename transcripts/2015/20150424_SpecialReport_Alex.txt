[00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:18.026]  Well, as we approach April, which is the official false flag month for the United States, it appears things are getting weirder and weirder.
[00:00:18.486 --> 00:00:25.609]  Yahoo News reports, men dressed as women shot outside NSA gate, tried to ram past checkpoint, officials say.
[00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:32.911]  One man is dead and another is severely injured after a shootout at one of the main gates of the National Security Agency located at Fort Meade, Maryland.
[00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:38.513]  Two men dressed as women attempted to penetrate the entry point with their vehicle when a shootout occurred, officials said.
[00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:42.857]  My Fox DC also confirmed that these men were dressed as women.
[00:00:43.097 --> 00:00:48.180]  Fox News has reported that there were two occupants of the vehicle and that they were both men dressed as women.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.562]  Aerial video shows a woman's wig on the ground outside a black SUV at the scene.
[00:00:53.042 --> 00:00:58.645]  Two people, a 20-year-old male and a 44-year-old male, were injured and flown to shock trauma in Baltimore.
[00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:03.728]  They also mentioned that one of the occupants was declared dead on the scene and one was taken to the hospital.
[00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:07.971]  So it appears another person is injured, possibly a security guard, a bystander.
[00:01:08.472 --> 00:01:09.733]  It doesn't really say in this report.
[00:01:09.793 --> 00:01:12.374]  I'm sure that will come out as more information is released.
[00:01:12.414 --> 00:01:26.724]  But RT is reporting, the FBI was quick to release a statement that this was no way an act of terrorism, even though they found a quantity of drugs in the car, there was a gun, these guys tried to penetrate through security, and two men dressed as women, and they were in a stolen SUV.
[00:01:27.685 --> 00:01:29.505]  In fact, the FBI released this statement.
[00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:33.886]  NBC News reported that a highly placed official unauthorized to speak has openly said that the incident was a local criminal matter.
[00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:59.058]  We have drugs, a gun, you have men dressed up as women that try to ram through a gate at a NSA facility, yet they're saying without a major investigation that there's no terrorism at all.
[00:01:59.578 --> 00:02:12.148]  But it seems as if if this would have been a militia member, if the guy had a Gadsden flag on and he would have been carrying one pistol, it would have been the end of the world and this would have confirmed everybody's fears that returning vets and patriots are considered terrorists.
[00:02:12.408 --> 00:02:16.152]  Now this isn't the first time the NSA has been attacked in the past month.
[00:02:16.212 --> 00:02:16.552]  In fact,
[00:02:16.852 --> 00:02:26.981]  Earlier in the month, there was a young man named Hong Young, who's in his mid-30s, who was arrested for allegedly shooting twice at the building of the NSA headquarters.
[00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:29.523]  He was also shooting at various vehicles in the area.
[00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:32.145]  He is now in jail, now without bail.
[00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:37.770]  But it's interesting to see that in the past month, the NSA has been attacked on two occasions.
[00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:39.151]  What does this mean?
[00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:49.456]  Are people getting fed up with the fact that there's an organization in the government that is completely spying on everyone in the world and we can do nothing about it, there's no recourse for us, we just have to accept it?
[00:02:49.476 --> 00:02:50.036]  No.
[00:02:50.257 --> 00:02:53.159]  People obviously seem to be pissed off and are fighting back.
[00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:59.383]  It's just really interesting the fact that now it seems to be transvestites are now attacking the NSA.
[00:02:59.784 --> 00:03:02.606]  But maybe it'll come out that these two were government officials.
[00:03:03.686 --> 00:03:05.348]  We just had the Secret Service
[00:03:05.868 --> 00:03:08.529]  They were drunk coming back from a party, rammed the gate at the White House.
[00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:15.211]  It's been disclosed that now there's wild sex parties in Colombia with DEA agents, Secret Service.
[00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:17.992]  I mean, it's like our government is out of control.
[00:03:18.252 --> 00:03:19.813]  Now, I'm not saying these guys are with the government.
[00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:21.173]  It'll probably come out that they weren't.
[00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:27.396]  But it just illustrates the amount of madness that is going on as we approach False Flag Month here in America.
[00:03:27.596 --> 00:03:31.077]  This is Rob Dewey reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:03:31.317 --> 00:03:34.639]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:37.000]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:45.465]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:03:45.765 --> 00:03:48.907]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others,
