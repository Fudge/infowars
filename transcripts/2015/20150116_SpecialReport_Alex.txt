[00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:20.840]  I appeared before the Congressional Committee, the highest representation of the American people, under a subpoena to tell what I knew of activities, which I believe might lead to an attempt to set up a fascist dictatorship.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.902]  Does America owe its edge in military technology to Nazi war criminals brought here after World War II?
[00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:34.965]  The truth is that thousands of former Nazis, some of whom committed atrocities, went to work for the United States government.
[00:00:35.345 --> 00:00:46.353]  Do you have any people paid by the CIA who are working for television networks?
[00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:53.118]  This, I think, gets into the kind of getting into the details, Mr. Chairman, that I'd like to get into an executive session.
[00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:54.620]  At CBS, we
[00:00:57.276 --> 00:00:58.917]  Had been contacted by the CIA.
[00:00:58.997 --> 00:01:08.680]  As a matter of fact, by the time I became the head of the whole News and Public Affairs operation in 1954, the ships had been established and I was told about them and asked if I'd carry on with them.
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.462]  We're really talking about intelligence at the highest levels of the U.S.
[00:01:12.482 --> 00:01:15.243]  government, setting the broad direction for the nation.
[00:01:15.543 --> 00:01:23.866]  Have you brought with you some of those devices which would have enabled the CIA to use this poison for
[00:01:24.858 --> 00:01:27.500]  We have indeed for killing people.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.963]  But also the toxin itself would not appear in the autopsy?
[00:01:31.983 --> 00:01:32.243]  Yes.
[00:01:32.924 --> 00:01:35.866]  Well, when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.
[00:01:37.607 --> 00:01:45.433]  If you've been anywhere near a television set or a radio these past few hours, you already know that John Lennon of the Beatles is dead.
[00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:49.956]  He was shot late this evening in front of his apartment building in New York City.
[00:01:51.536 --> 00:01:57.560]  Despite evidence that Noriega was involved in drug trafficking, Bush kept Noriega on the payroll.
[00:01:57.781 --> 00:02:13.552]  We interrupt your regular programming to tell you of a plane crash in northeastern Minnesota, where we have just had confirmed a short while ago, eight people were killed on a small beach aircraft that was on its way to Evelyn, Minnesota, including Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota.
[00:02:14.253 --> 00:02:19.937]  According to the senior staff in the senator's office, not only the senator, but his wife, Sheila, his daughter,
[00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:23.891]  Three members of his staff, and the two pilots.
[00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:29.254]  The CIA has been, and is now, completely out of control.
[00:02:29.614 --> 00:02:38.739]  The accusation is that drugs are being sold by the Contras, and that the CIA knew about it, and didn't do anything.
[00:02:44.322 --> 00:02:46.123]  Shots fired.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.221]  Get him out!
[00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:49.681]  Get him out!
[00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:50.342]  Get him out!
[00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:51.182]  Get him out!
[00:02:51.222 --> 00:02:51.803]  Get him out!
[00:02:51.823 --> 00:02:52.383]  Get him out!
[00:02:52.403 --> 00:02:52.964]  Get him out!
[00:02:52.984 --> 00:02:53.524]  Get him out!
[00:02:53.544 --> 00:02:54.485]  Get him out!
[00:02:54.525 --> 00:02:55.966]  Get him out!
[00:02:56.186 --> 00:02:56.787]  Get him out!
[00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:20.125]  The United States tonight declared in effect that Panama's General Manuel Noriega is a threat to this country's national security.
[00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:27.051]  When George Bush became director of the CIA in 1976, he inherited Noriega as a contact.
[00:03:27.231 --> 00:03:34.738]  When you read these outrageous charges by a drug-related indicted dictator, discount them.
[00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:36.139]  They are total lies.
[00:03:48.454 --> 00:03:54.755]  In 1976, Flight 455, which took off from Venezuela, bound for Cuba, suddenly exploded.
[00:03:54.935 --> 00:04:00.736]  All 73 passengers and 5 crew members aboard died after the plane crashed near Barbados.
[00:04:00.796 --> 00:04:06.157]  We have an explosion and we are descending immediately.
[00:04:06.197 --> 00:04:07.977]  We have fire on board.
[00:04:08.017 --> 00:04:11.698]  Request an immediate, immediate landing.
[00:04:16.175 --> 00:04:20.696]  More of the terrorists were found to be Latin Americans contracted by the U.S.
[00:04:21.116 --> 00:04:25.757]  One of the attack's masterminds, Posada Capriles, currently lives freely in Miami.
[00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:37.720]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.922]  I will tell you, Director Deutsch, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[00:04:49.864 --> 00:04:55.566]  Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September the 11th.
[00:04:55.626 --> 00:05:11.691]  The numbers about potential civilian casualties, I take with a somewhat big grain of salt.
[00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:13.471]  Let us bomb these places.
[00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:15.872]  What does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family?
[00:05:16.632 --> 00:05:17.533]  My sister-in-law.
[00:05:17.893 --> 00:05:18.653]  I love Bill Clinton.
[00:05:19.867 --> 00:05:20.127]  J.K.
[00:05:20.207 --> 00:05:20.467]  Morgan.
