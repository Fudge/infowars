[00:00:11.465 --> 00:00:19.491]  Hey guys, Rob Dew here from InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News and I want to talk about vaccines and why they are safe and effective and why you should get them and why they're good for you.
[00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:26.696]  Now actually, I don't want to say that, but if I was working for the CBS local channel 13 in California, that's what I would be telling you.
[00:00:26.736 --> 00:00:29.018]  Here's their article now as it appeared on the Drudge Report.
[00:00:29.438 --> 00:00:32.140]  Measles outbreak that started in California expanding.
[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.422]  The outbreak that started in California's Disneyland is expanding.
[00:00:35.462 --> 00:00:38.365]  At least 75 cases of measles span six states.
[00:00:39.315 --> 00:00:47.621]  And the article goes on to say how the disease is highly contagious, it's spanning all these states, and people need to go out and get their vaccine because it is safe and effective.
[00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:51.143]  But then let's look at an LA Times story from just yesterday.
[00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:16.781]  They go on to say there's a 5% chance of vaccine failure in people who've had only one dose, and a 1% in people with both doses.
[00:01:17.141 --> 00:01:18.482]  And that's what the experts say.
[00:01:18.882 --> 00:01:29.250]  And then you go to the very next sentence, the next paragraph down, it says, California's last measles outbreak started about a year ago, also centered in Orange County, and involved residents returning from the Philippines with the disease.
[00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.873]  In that case, 18% of those who got sick had been immunized.
[00:01:33.547 --> 00:01:38.149]  So we go from 1% and 5% to 18% all in the span of one article.
[00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:48.032]  In 2011, a New York City outbreak was traced to a fully vaccinated 22-year-old woman who not only got measles but spread it to four other people who also had immunity to the disease.
[00:01:48.352 --> 00:01:49.492]  But the vaccine works, right?
[00:01:49.532 --> 00:01:50.292]  It's very effective.
[00:01:50.593 --> 00:01:51.413]  It's safe and effective.
[00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:53.714]  They keep shoving that down your throat that you have to get it.
[00:01:53.754 --> 00:01:54.394]  You have to get it.
[00:01:55.194 --> 00:01:57.335]  This looks like propaganda for the vaccine companies.
[00:01:57.796 --> 00:01:58.956]  We just got to go out and get our vaccines.
[00:01:58.976 --> 00:01:59.837]  Remember with the flu shot?
[00:01:59.897 --> 00:02:00.917]  All this flu shot stuff?
[00:02:01.317 --> 00:02:02.438]  Now it's this measles stuff.
[00:02:02.838 --> 00:02:10.823]  They're trying to get it into your minds that if you don't get vaccinated, you're helping spread the disease to other people and that you're responsible and you're selfish for not getting it.
[00:02:11.283 --> 00:02:11.783]  There's more.
[00:02:12.324 --> 00:02:16.486]  Health officials have immunization records of 43 measles patients.
[00:02:16.506 --> 00:02:20.129]  37 were unimmunized, one had only one shot, and five were fully immunized.
[00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:25.772]  So that's 43 out of the 70 that now have the disease all over who've been to Disneyland.
[00:02:26.113 --> 00:02:27.233]  And there's even five workers.
[00:02:27.273 --> 00:02:27.834]  Check this out.
[00:02:28.294 --> 00:02:30.636]  Five infected park workers have been placed on leave.
[00:02:31.136 --> 00:02:33.137]  Two of the five workers were vaccinated.
[00:02:33.537 --> 00:02:36.079]  Two-fifths of the workers were fully vaccinated.
[00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:36.619]  Do the math.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.540]  It's a lot more than 1% or 5%.
[00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:43.308]  But as Dr. Gil Chavez said, the vaccine is safe and effective.
[00:02:43.648 --> 00:02:47.690]  So we can depend on our government to always come back with that same tried and true line.
[00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.771]  It's safe and effective to get the vaccines.
[00:02:50.172 --> 00:02:52.053]  I'm going to go over what's in the vaccine in a second.
[00:02:52.593 --> 00:02:54.634]  But let's look at who makes the vaccine, and that's Merck.
[00:02:54.734 --> 00:02:59.937]  Merck is responsible for the MMR vaccine that they tell you to get at least two shots now as you're a little kid.
[00:03:00.397 --> 00:03:02.178]  I got the MMR vaccine when I was a kid.
[00:03:02.478 --> 00:03:02.919]  And guess what?
[00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.319]  I got mumps when I was a teenager.
[00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:05.220]  So it didn't stop.
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.147]  And, of course, they came out and said, yeah, people are getting the mumps now, so you've got to get another vaccine, an extra booster, to really protect yourself.
[00:03:11.447 --> 00:03:14.711]  It's always one more, one more and it's going to help you, one more and it's going to help you.
[00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:21.038]  Or, as in the case of the flu vaccine, well, this year it mutated, so the strain's different, so we can't do anything about it.
[00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:22.260]  But let's go back to Merck.
[00:03:23.618 --> 00:03:26.602]  Did Merck unfairly monopolize the market for a mumps vaccine?
[00:03:26.882 --> 00:03:28.645]  This is out of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:03:29.306 --> 00:03:32.510]  And this has to do with a lawsuit that two former Merck employees filed.
[00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.471]  Here's what they said.
[00:03:38.578 --> 00:03:45.461]  They allege that senior management was aware, complicit, and in charge of testing that concealed the actual effectiveness according to court documents.
[00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:49.343]  So there you have it in court documents from two different whistleblowers, virologists.
[00:03:49.363 --> 00:03:52.664]  These are people who test this vaccine, who work on it continuously.
[00:03:53.104 --> 00:03:55.805]  And they say the efficacy rates are being falsified.
[00:03:56.506 --> 00:03:58.246]  That should cause you a lot of concern.
[00:03:58.266 --> 00:04:00.067]  Now I'm going to cause you a little more concern.
[00:04:00.087 --> 00:04:01.328]  I'm going to reach into my pocket.
[00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:04.049]  And get the old MMR insert.
[00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:14.137]  That's right, when they first wanted to give my kid vaccinations, I asked for the insert that comes with the vaccine, not the 8 1⁄2 by 11 sheet of paper that says vaccines are safe and effective.
[00:04:14.677 --> 00:04:16.979]  This is what they have to put out with every vaccine.
[00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:21.101]  So if they say they don't have any on hand, they're lying to you, which is part of their job.
[00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:22.763]  Their job is to get you vaccinated.
[00:04:23.523 --> 00:04:24.544]  So let's start at the top here.
[00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:28.607]  Here it says MMR2, the old Merck vaccine.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.660]  And guess what?
[00:04:31.161 --> 00:04:34.002]  It's got three different live viruses in it.
[00:04:34.102 --> 00:04:38.324]  It's got the Atenovax Measles Virus Vaccine Live.
[00:04:38.784 --> 00:04:45.848]  It also has Mumps Virus Vaccine Live and Verovax 2 Rubella Virus Vaccine Live.
[00:04:46.368 --> 00:05:00.839]  These are grown in a medium called 199, which is a buffered salt solution containing vitamins and amino acids and supplemented with fetal bovine serum containing SPGA, which is sucrose, phosphate, glutamate, and recombinant human albumin.
[00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.663]  And albumin is the clear protein type stuff in your blood, not the actual red blood cells.
[00:05:06.203 --> 00:05:11.848]  So they're injecting human blood into your body, into your baby's bodies, and telling them it's good for them.
[00:05:12.268 --> 00:05:12.928]  In addition to the
[00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:15.230]  Bovine Fetal Serum.
[00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.650]  Now, let's go to the contradiction section.
[00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:21.592]  Hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine, including gelatin.
[00:05:21.612 --> 00:05:22.552]  That means don't take it.
[00:05:23.032 --> 00:05:25.033]  Do not give the MMR2 to pregnant females.
[00:05:25.273 --> 00:05:28.974]  The possible effects of the vaccine on fetal development are unknown at this time.
[00:05:29.274 --> 00:05:31.655]  Well, at least they're telling you not to give it to pregnant females.
[00:05:31.695 --> 00:05:33.836]  So, do got to give Merck some props for that.
[00:05:34.136 --> 00:05:40.138]  Unlike the flu vaccine, which they're saying, just eject all that mercury into pregnant ladies because mercury is good for you.
[00:05:40.418 --> 00:05:42.439]  It will not harm you, as they said in this news report.
[00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.875]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[00:05:49.495 --> 00:05:55.540]  Moving on through the insert a little bit more, we come to my favorite section, which is in every single vaccine insert that I've ever read.
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.122]  Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility.
[00:05:59.603 --> 00:06:05.688]  MMR2 has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or potential to impair fertility.
[00:06:06.428 --> 00:06:12.276]  So they don't even know if this thing will make you sterile or not, but they want you to take it anyway, and they won't even test for it, because they don't have to.
[00:06:12.576 --> 00:06:13.137]  There's a law.
[00:06:13.397 --> 00:06:14.959]  Now let's go to the adverse reactions.
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.221]  Well, body as a whole.
[00:06:16.922 --> 00:06:18.884]  Atypical measles is one of the side effects.
[00:06:18.904 --> 00:06:21.848]  You'll actually get measles from injecting this into your body.
[00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:23.430]  It says it here in the insert.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:48.275]  You also have pancreatitis, diabetes, anaphylaxis shock, arthritis, myalgia, encephalitis, measles, they list measles again, pneumonia, measles-like rash, nerve deafness, and also death under the other section.
[00:06:48.315 --> 00:06:51.117]  Death also could occur from the measles vaccine.
[00:06:51.717 --> 00:06:52.538]  At least they list it.
[00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:54.583]  In the fine print.
[00:06:54.603 --> 00:06:57.628]  But you've got to read a lot of mumbo jumbo to get down there.
[00:06:58.269 --> 00:07:04.419]  So, are you going to go out and get your measles vaccine like the good people on the nightly news are telling you?
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.384]  Are you going to inject that kind of stuff into your body?
[00:07:08.737 --> 00:07:08.997]  Are you?
[00:07:09.017 --> 00:07:19.525]  You're going to inject live viruses and fetal bovine syndrome and egg protein and human blood cells into your body and hope that you don't get the measles?
[00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:23.087]  The measles, which has been around for a long time, a lot of people get it.
[00:07:23.107 --> 00:07:25.889]  It's one of those childhood diseases you're supposed to get and then become immune to.
[00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:30.953]  It doesn't kill a lot of people, especially here, especially when you have a healthy immune system.
[00:07:30.993 --> 00:07:33.095]  That's why it's very important to have a healthy immune system.
[00:07:33.815 --> 00:07:37.404]  And if you want to check out some of our products at Infowarslife.com, feel free to do so.
[00:07:37.424 --> 00:07:38.626]  I use a lot of them.
[00:07:38.687 --> 00:07:40.531]  I use the Fluoride Shield.
[00:07:41.092 --> 00:07:42.536]  I use the Iodine X2.
[00:07:44.204 --> 00:07:52.652]  I use the Oxy Powder not every day but on intervals when I really want to clean myself out and they all work great and I feel 100% better than I used to.
[00:07:53.153 --> 00:08:01.400]  I feel like I did when I was like 18 or 19 and before I started eating a bunch of fast food in college and I mean I almost lost my hair when I was in college.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.642]  That's how much crap I used to put in my body.
[00:08:04.043 --> 00:08:06.745]  But now that's all changed because I realize that the things you put in your body
[00:08:07.406 --> 00:08:08.246]  Can do harm.
[00:08:08.526 --> 00:08:09.447]  They can also do good.
[00:08:09.787 --> 00:08:11.207]  So with that, that's the end of this report.
[00:08:11.227 --> 00:08:13.948]  This is Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:08:40.723 --> 00:08:43.284]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[00:08:43.404 --> 00:08:44.544]  And the truth is, it's hard.
[00:08:44.804 --> 00:08:46.285]  Even with diet and exercise.
[00:08:46.485 --> 00:08:51.527]  Because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[00:08:51.667 --> 00:08:58.509]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise,
[00:08:58.809 --> 00:09:00.811]  Worthy answers that synergistically worked.
[00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:04.595]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost.
[00:09:04.955 --> 00:09:07.558]  I increase stamina and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[00:09:07.878 --> 00:09:13.824]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWars Life Resolution Pack, combining three essential formulations.
