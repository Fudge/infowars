[00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:05.761]  Yeah.
[00:00:09.838 --> 00:00:16.963]  Presidential candidate Donald Trump has been suffering a lot of political backlash for daring to exercise his freedom of speech.
[00:00:17.424 --> 00:00:20.626]  But now they're hitting him where it hurts, his pocketbook.
[00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:30.754]  He has lost tens of millions of dollars in response to his politically incorrect comments about illegal immigration, even though they might be factually correct.
[00:00:30.994 --> 00:00:34.837]  And that's why some people are rallying behind Trump, agreeing with his comments.
[00:00:35.137 --> 00:00:41.399]  Thousands of people who've been murdered by illegal aliens, and raped, and child molesters, and drunk drivers.
[00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.180]  So Donald Trump was right on.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:49.942]  I mean, in our community, what we call the death community, Donald Trump is like speaking for us, speaking for our dead.
[00:00:50.422 --> 00:00:59.070]  And we all know that the establishment media is notorious for ignoring important political issues by concentrating on individual takedowns.
[00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.052]  We are taking Mexico's problems.
[00:01:02.493 --> 00:01:06.136]  Mexico is beating us on trade and they're beating us at the border.
[00:01:06.496 --> 00:01:09.097]  But Mexico doesn't want to take these people, so what do they do?
[00:01:09.397 --> 00:01:14.960]  They send them to our stupid politicians, and we have sanctuary cities, and we have all of this nonsense.
[00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.142]  I've been saying this for a long time, Katie, and it's a disgrace.
[00:01:18.282 --> 00:01:22.404]  And frankly, if I didn't bring it up, you wouldn't even be talking about immigration right now.
[00:01:23.092 --> 00:01:25.974]  Illegal immigration is an issue for the United States.
[00:01:26.515 --> 00:01:28.236]  According to new data from the U.S.
[00:01:28.376 --> 00:01:35.622]  Sentencing Commission, illegal aliens were responsible for three-fourths of federal drug sentences in 2014.
[00:01:35.802 --> 00:01:39.585]  They also made up more than one-third of all federal sentences.
[00:01:39.925 --> 00:01:46.550]  The establishment media would also like you to forget that some pretty powerful Democrats used to agree with Trump.
[00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.813]  If making it easy to be an illegal alien isn't enough,
[00:01:50.433 --> 00:01:53.555]  How about offering a reward for being an illegal immigrant?
[00:01:53.975 --> 00:01:55.276]  No sane country would do that.
[00:01:55.997 --> 00:01:56.217]  Right?
[00:01:57.197 --> 00:01:57.658]  Guess again.
[00:01:58.578 --> 00:02:06.483]  If you break our laws by entering this country without permission and give birth to a child, we reward that child with U.S.
[00:02:06.623 --> 00:02:13.087]  citizenship and guarantee a full access to all public and social services this society provides.
[00:02:13.468 --> 00:02:15.009]  And that's a lot of services.
[00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:18.871]  Is it any wonder that two-thirds of the babies born at taxpayer expense
[00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:25.857]  Country, county-run hospitals in Los Angeles are born to illegal alien mothers.
[00:02:26.357 --> 00:02:33.043]  That was 1993, Harry Reid, introducing his bill, the Immigration Stabilization Act of 1993.
[00:02:33.163 --> 00:02:44.914]  In a press release unveiling the bill, Reid noted, Our borders have overflowed with illegal immigrants placing tremendous burdens on our criminal justice system, schools, and social programs.
[00:02:45.194 --> 00:02:54.599]  Our federal wallet is stretched to the limit by illegal aliens getting welfare, food stamps, medical care, and other benefits, often without paying any taxes.
[00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:59.742]  Safeguards like these are in place to boost Americans in need of short-term assistance.
[00:02:59.942 --> 00:03:05.285]  These programs were not meant to entice freeloaders and scam artists from around the world.
[00:03:05.565 --> 00:03:11.328]  Even worse, Americans have seen heinous crimes committed by individuals who are here illegally.
[00:03:11.628 --> 00:03:13.349]  Where is the media witch hunt?
[00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:15.971]  But he's not the only flip-flopper.
[00:03:30.902 --> 00:03:33.243]  So what happened to change their tune?
[00:03:33.563 --> 00:03:36.283]  Did their hearts suddenly grow three sizes?
[00:03:36.884 --> 00:03:46.346]  Or could it be that the number of Latino voters in this country has increased by 300% in the last 30 years and that number is only climbing?
[00:03:46.766 --> 00:03:48.227]  That's what this is really about.
[00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:52.948]  Last June, University of California professor Daryl Y. Hamamoto
[00:03:53.368 --> 00:03:54.088]  Tell us about it!
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.303]  This is the so-called Cloward and Piven strategy at work, folks.
[00:04:18.603 --> 00:04:20.424]  The strategy here is very simple.
[00:04:20.704 --> 00:04:25.328]  You flood the welfare state with needy people until it reaches its breaking point.
[00:04:25.688 --> 00:04:30.691]  So then the people have no choice but to accept Marxism as a substitute.
[00:04:31.092 --> 00:04:40.138]  And the global elite are going to exploit this new privileged class of people to take down America and turn it into a third world cesspool.
