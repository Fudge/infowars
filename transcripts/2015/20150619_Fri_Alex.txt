[00:00:04.898 --> 00:00:06.200]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.962]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:09.744]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.744 --> 00:00:11.346]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.346 --> 00:00:12.868]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.868 --> 00:00:17.052]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.052 --> 00:00:21.117]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.623]  Buried in the memory hole of modern civilization lies the immoral, corrosive culture of the world's elite.
[00:00:34.623 --> 00:00:46.511]  Last week, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund, candidate for the French presidency, and Bilderberg attendee, closed another chapter on a saga rife with perversion.
[00:00:46.511 --> 00:00:53.876]  A French court acquitted Kahn of aggravated pimping, claiming that Kahn did not help operate an illegal prostitution network.
[00:00:54.156 --> 00:01:04.264]  The Carlton Affair is named after one of the hotels where businessmen and police officials allegedly organized sex parties that took place in Brussels, Paris and Washington.
[00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:15.412]  Khan said he was present at the orgies, attended by lawyers, judges, police officials and journalists, because he was overwhelmed with stress dealing with saving the world's economy as the head of the IMF.
[00:01:15.732 --> 00:01:25.396]  That stress really must have gotten to him when he sexually assaulted a maid in a Times Square hotel only hours before he was scheduled to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
[00:01:25.396 --> 00:01:39.382]  In the UK, Scotland Yard is finally launching an inquiry into the 30-plus year cover-up of child sex abuse rings perpetrated by judges, politicians, intelligence officers, and staff at the Royal Palaces.
[00:01:39.382 --> 00:01:44.424]  It would later be revealed that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's protege, Leon Britton,
[00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:52.832]  was at the center of the cover-up and was under investigation for raping a woman and sexually abusing boys up until his death this year.
[00:01:52.832 --> 00:02:01.561]  He was back at the center of controversy last year amidst questions over his handling of allegations of sexual abuse when he was Home Secretary 30 years ago.
[00:02:02.862 --> 00:02:16.954]  A sad day for the survivors of child sex abuse because they would have wanted to hear from Sir Leon Britton at this inquiry in terms of what he knew about the allegations that were made during the 1980s.
[00:02:16.954 --> 00:02:23.159]  In 2014, former Obama staffer Donnie Ray Williams pleaded guilty to raping two women.
[00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:29.584]  He drugged the first one with Ambien and raped the second one after she was so intoxicated she couldn't give proper consent.
[00:02:29.844 --> 00:02:35.091]  In 2013, William suffered an acid attack to his face and body by an unknown man.
[00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:41.959]  He used this attack as an excuse to sway the judge to give him five years probation, rather than any prison time.
[00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.407]  And this only scrapes the surface of the many allegations weighing on the overall perception of the ruling elite.
[00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.955]  The report is a devastating critique of the Vatican's performance in dealing with child sex abuse.
[00:02:54.955 --> 00:03:00.261]  It says it's still not willing to recognize the scale of the problem or take responsibility for it.
[00:03:00.261 --> 00:03:05.247]  The church is still moving guilty abusers from parish to parish to avoid prosecution.
[00:03:05.247 --> 00:03:06.228]  That must stop.
[00:03:06.468 --> 00:03:17.593]  Fourteen French soldiers who were working as UN peacekeepers in the Central African Republic have been accused of sexually abusing refugee children and feeding them only in exchange for sex.
[00:03:17.593 --> 00:03:22.316]  I didn't know that the thing was Bohemian Grove back then, nor did the kid when he was writing it.
[00:03:22.316 --> 00:03:24.216]  All he knew was he was taken to this place.
[00:03:24.216 --> 00:03:29.539]  I know this is Banassi, a kid named Paul Banassi writing this, and this is directly word for word from his diary.
[00:03:30.146 --> 00:03:33.108]  I went in January of 84 on every trip.
[00:03:33.108 --> 00:03:35.169]  I was paid by men King knew for sex.
[00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:41.452]  In the summer of 84 sometime I went to Dallas, Texas and had sex with several men King knew in a hotel.
[00:03:41.452 --> 00:03:49.177]  I flew on YNR Airlines, by the way that's a private airline or just private charter deal, and KAM Airlines, another private charter deal.
[00:03:49.177 --> 00:03:55.300]  King flew me out on a private plane from Kepley Airfield in Omaha to Denver where we picked up Nicholas, a boy who was about 12 or 13.
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.761]  Then we flew to Vegas.
[00:03:56.761 --> 00:03:58.862]  Nicholas and I were driven to an area that had
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.181]  I don't
[00:04:19.682 --> 00:04:20.363]  I don't think so.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.041]  We'll be back, folks.
[00:04:40.041 --> 00:04:41.142]  The full reports at Infowars.com.
[00:04:41.142 --> 00:04:41.443]  We're live.
[00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:12.094]  ISIS, blatantly supported by John McCain and the Pentagon, and hesitantly supplied tanks, rocket launchers, missile and anti-aircraft systems in accidental airdrops.
[00:05:12.094 --> 00:05:16.260]  They're just sending arms, very frankly, although they need them very badly.
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.343]  They need anti-tank and anti-air weapons.
[00:05:19.203 --> 00:05:23.604]  ...is not going to change the situation on the ground and the massacre goes on.
[00:05:23.604 --> 00:05:31.166]  Now it has been confirmed that ISIS has stockpiled enough radioactive material to create weapons of mass destruction.
[00:05:31.166 --> 00:05:45.130]  In the ISIS magazine Dabiq, ISIS declared their intent to acquire a nuclear warhead from Pakistan with their billions of stolen funds, gobbled up as they ransacked banks and took control of oil fields across Iraq and Syria.
[00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:55.118]  ISIS claims that all they have to do is call on their leaders in Pakistan to purchase a nuclear device through weapons dealers with links to corrupt officials in the region.
[00:05:55.118 --> 00:05:57.140]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:05:58.755 --> 00:06:15.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website InfoWars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.921]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[00:06:19.261 --> 00:06:23.306]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:06:23.306 --> 00:06:24.868]  Hdfirearms.com.
[00:06:24.868 --> 00:06:28.191]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs and Special Ops people.
[00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:33.297]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[00:06:33.297 --> 00:06:34.138]  It's always about security.
[00:06:34.138 --> 00:06:34.518]  I think so.
[00:06:58.602 --> 00:07:04.348]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:07:04.348 --> 00:07:18.802]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:07:19.062 --> 00:07:27.044]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:07:27.044 --> 00:07:32.625]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:07:32.625 --> 00:07:36.186]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:07:36.186 --> 00:07:40.307]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:07:40.307 --> 00:07:44.208]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:07:44.628 --> 00:07:48.751]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.
[00:07:48.751 --> 00:07:53.835]  Secure your Liver Shield today exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com for the lowest price available.

[00:08:16.241 --> 00:08:22.705]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:22.705 --> 00:08:30.249]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:30.249 --> 00:08:37.573]  It's not just the United States, but the entire planet is converting to tyranny.
[00:08:37.573 --> 00:08:38.333]  It's in style.
[00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:43.369]  And it's been in style before throughout history.
[00:08:43.369 --> 00:08:53.718]  And when oppression, when centralized systems come into full control, hell itself is released on the surface of this globe.
[00:08:53.718 --> 00:09:02.185]  We have a lot of new developments and angles and information concerning the tragic shooting Wednesday night.
[00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:05.832]  In South Carolina.
[00:09:05.832 --> 00:09:14.537]  And the deranged shooter, who has now reportedly admitted that he did it, and said that he wanted to start a race war.
[00:09:14.537 --> 00:09:16.018]  Well, that's not hard to figure out.
[00:09:16.018 --> 00:09:20.721]  So did Charlie Manson.
[00:09:20.721 --> 00:09:25.183]  And then you've got the Turner Diaries written by Pierce.
[00:09:25.183 --> 00:09:29.586]  And then you've got all the connections between those organizations and the globalists and the federal government.
[00:09:31.425 --> 00:09:35.668]  And you've got the Democratic Party with its history of being the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:09:35.668 --> 00:09:41.773]  They are now attempting to create, basically, Balkanization chaos here in the United States.
[00:09:41.773 --> 00:09:51.620]  They're clearly pushing a racial conflagration in this country to divert off of the fact that
[00:09:53.075 --> 00:09:55.557]  Europe is in turmoil.
[00:09:55.557 --> 00:09:57.478]  There are bank runs taking place.
[00:09:57.478 --> 00:10:02.962]  There are open discussions of freezing bank accounts and the EU falling apart.
[00:10:02.962 --> 00:10:10.488]  Ron Paul is in CNBC warning that the stock market day of reckoning is near.
[00:10:10.488 --> 00:10:20.155]  The IMF trained Greek journalist in Washington to spin stories in favor of more bailouts to the banks.
[00:10:21.658 --> 00:10:30.005]  Elite financier George Soros warns of World War III again and says it's not an exaggeration.
[00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:40.755]  Meanwhile, the United States is building anti-cruise missile bases on the east and west coast preparing for submarine-launched cruise missile attacks.
[00:10:40.755 --> 00:10:41.856]  That's from Defense One.
[00:10:44.778 --> 00:10:46.159]  And it gets worse.
[00:10:46.159 --> 00:11:01.392]  We talked about this last week, Curt Nemo wrote about it, that the House Republican leadership was planning to try to pass fast track, giving the president dictatorial power to sign us on to anything he wants for four years, not just this president, but the next.
[00:11:01.392 --> 00:11:06.637]  Well, while we were busy wringing our hands over the nine dead in Charleston,
[00:11:08.717 --> 00:11:12.760]  They passed Fast Track that we defeated Friday in the House.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.584]  Now, it's got to go back to the Senate.
[00:11:17.584 --> 00:11:21.888]  But then if it passes there, where it's already passed before, it's a done deal.
[00:11:21.888 --> 00:11:23.069]  This is a travesty.
[00:11:23.069 --> 00:11:25.511]  And I was saying yesterday, watch!
[00:11:25.511 --> 00:11:30.875]  They're going to try to ram this through while Obama's up there demonizing the Second Amendment.
[00:11:30.875 --> 00:11:37.581]  Because another drugged up whack job probably got wound up by somebody, undoubtedly, went in and killed nine people.
[00:11:40.489 --> 00:11:44.231]  Doesn't matter if 14 black people die a week on average in Chicago.
[00:11:44.231 --> 00:11:47.273]  Look it up.
[00:11:47.273 --> 00:11:49.414]  93% of them killed by other blacks.
[00:11:49.414 --> 00:11:51.675]  Doesn't matter if you've got similar numbers in D.C.
[00:11:51.675 --> 00:11:53.356]  and other areas.
[00:11:53.356 --> 00:12:04.603]  These nine will now be the martyrs and the collective white guilt to do the right thing and turn our guns in and accept open borders and just accept whatever we're told.
[00:12:04.603 --> 00:12:06.164]  Accept Obamacare or we're racist.
[00:12:07.631 --> 00:12:15.235]  And Salon, the White House front group, White House manipulated.
[00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:18.437]  White House controlled.
[00:12:18.437 --> 00:12:24.221]  It's totally clear when we look at groups like Media Matters and then Salon just parrots whatever they say.
[00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:29.364]  White America must answer for the Charleston church massacre.
[00:12:30.771 --> 00:12:32.292]  White America!
[00:12:32.292 --> 00:12:38.454]  It doesn't matter if blacks commit eight times more crimes against whites per capita than the FBI's own numbers.
[00:12:38.454 --> 00:12:47.718]  It doesn't matter if there is a criminal culture that is in a minority of blacks but still substantive that is seen as cool.
[00:12:47.718 --> 00:12:53.340]  And to go physically attack or shoot or kill a white person or a Hispanic or an Asian
[00:12:54.756 --> 00:12:59.680]  I mean, it's pushed in black culture, even by religious leaders, to attack Asians.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:04.904]  Asians are the most hated, I guess, on that totem pole.
[00:13:04.904 --> 00:13:07.006]  And that supposedly is acceptable.
[00:13:07.006 --> 00:13:13.512]  It's not acceptable when the dirtbag went into the black church and shot nine people.
[00:13:13.512 --> 00:13:18.516]  And it's not acceptable when a black dirtbag goes out and shoots some white people.
[00:13:19.445 --> 00:13:21.506]  But the media calls it the knockout game.
[00:13:21.506 --> 00:13:30.850]  It's just a game when you go out and find an old white person and walk up and sucker punch him and then their head hits the concrete and their head bust open and they die.
[00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:35.392]  It's kind of cute and funny because you know the cracker deserved it.
[00:13:35.392 --> 00:13:37.413]  Some cracker probably poorer than you are.
[00:13:37.413 --> 00:13:47.538]  And we can't deport the 36,000 illegals they just released with felony backgrounds who mainly feed on Hispanics because that would be racist.
[00:13:48.615 --> 00:13:52.439]  You're an arson, you're a rapist, you're a hit and run.
[00:13:52.439 --> 00:13:55.201]  You've been in two, three, four times, it's okay.
[00:13:55.201 --> 00:14:00.146]  And by the way, right now they're trying to ram through total blanket amnesty.
[00:14:00.146 --> 00:14:05.091]  And Obama's giving out tips on how to get worker visas.
[00:14:05.091 --> 00:14:10.536]  And they're advertising on CNN, hey China, come here, have your babies, it's all free.
[00:14:10.536 --> 00:14:11.297]  To where now,
[00:14:13.024 --> 00:14:16.207]  Chinese are the biggest immigrants to the U.S.
[00:14:16.207 --> 00:14:26.896]  and almost all these new immigrants are not skilled laborers, they are welfare tourists coming here to milk the joke of a system we've got.
[00:14:26.896 --> 00:14:27.957]  And why not?
[00:14:27.957 --> 00:14:39.347]  It's advertised, you get a plane ticket here, we'll give you a visa, get on a plane, come here, you're a baby, everything's free, and that baby's a citizen, you get full welfare, you get to stay.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.981]  Am I against Chinese people?
[00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:42.202]  No.
[00:14:42.202 --> 00:14:43.943]  Am I against Mexicans?
[00:14:43.943 --> 00:14:44.924]  No.
[00:14:44.924 --> 00:14:48.187]  Am I against all the Eastern Europeans moving in here to also milk the welfare?
[00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:49.208]  No.
[00:14:49.208 --> 00:14:51.751]  Am I against the Africans coming in here to milk the welfare?
[00:14:51.751 --> 00:14:53.452]  No.
[00:14:53.452 --> 00:15:02.701]  But then I see African immigrants and others on Facebook and Twitter and InfoWars today saying, I'm an African immigrant and I'm telling you whites are the problem, you all need to be killed.
[00:15:05.086 --> 00:15:16.229]  Because racism is sold as cool by the Democratic Party and other socialist parties around the world as long as it's against white people.
[00:15:16.229 --> 00:15:28.212]  Because white people were the predominant middle class and were the West, so they've got to be bullied into turning power over to the globalists who were just the dominant white people.
[00:15:28.212 --> 00:15:29.893]  Whether they be Jewish or German or
[00:15:31.267 --> 00:15:34.109]  Scots or English or Dutch.
[00:15:34.109 --> 00:15:35.550]  That's who's dominant.
[00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:44.975]  And they sit there playing us all off against each other while they live in armored compounds or in island redoubts.
[00:15:44.975 --> 00:15:51.379]  Keeps, castles, fortresses.
[00:15:51.379 --> 00:15:57.323]  And now a friend of accused South Carolina shooter claims he wanted to start a race war.
[00:15:57.323 --> 00:15:59.024]  We've got that clip coming up after the break.
[00:16:00.461 --> 00:16:03.022]  I'm telling you, this is a Charlie Manson deal.
[00:16:03.022 --> 00:16:05.142]  I said that yesterday.
[00:16:05.142 --> 00:16:08.663]  This is a Charlie Manson start a race war, period.
[00:16:08.663 --> 00:16:10.704]  This is meant to start a race war.
[00:16:10.704 --> 00:16:12.345]  And now you know.
[00:16:12.345 --> 00:16:13.425]  That's what happened.
[00:16:13.425 --> 00:16:23.588]  Whether he's a cutout, whether he's drugged up, undoubtedly someone was handling him, someone was preparing him, someone was winding him up.
[00:16:24.528 --> 00:16:41.462]  And I said yesterday, A, trying to start a race war, and B, if he's on amnesiacs, then it goes from maybe it's a false flag to we gotta really investigate it now, it could be.
[00:16:41.462 --> 00:16:46.385]  And sure enough, the story's been top-linked on Drudge since yesterday, it's gone viral.
[00:16:46.385 --> 00:16:48.988]  All we did was go to the police statements, no one else had covered it.
[00:16:49.710 --> 00:17:00.196]  Where they admitted he was on the amnesic schedule three narcotic prescribed by a doctor.
[00:17:00.196 --> 00:17:05.620]  And he'd been in and out of the system for years.
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:17.447]  And this drug causes people to be horribly aggressive, to become violent, to commit suicide, Suboxone.
[00:17:18.601 --> 00:17:23.812]  And I've talked to two people in my office who've had family, both of which died recently.
[00:17:23.812 --> 00:17:27.761]  Well, Joe Jennings said he'd talk about it.
[00:17:27.761 --> 00:17:28.483]  His dad was on it.
[00:17:30.134 --> 00:17:35.777]  And one other person told me about it, but didn't want me to say their name, and it made their family member have a lot of problems.
[00:17:35.777 --> 00:17:36.838]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:17:36.838 --> 00:17:39.519]  I mean, Joe, you can pop in if you feel like it later and talk about it.
[00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:45.022]  I know your father recently died, so it's hard for you to talk about, but this is the whacked out stuff they've got people on.
[00:17:45.022 --> 00:17:46.803]  And you can argue, well, the drug didn't do it.
[00:17:46.803 --> 00:17:47.804]  They were already whacked out.
[00:17:47.804 --> 00:17:48.704]  Whatever.
[00:17:48.704 --> 00:17:58.770]  You put a crazy person on a hardcore drug, unless it's lithium, they're going to end up whacking out.
[00:18:00.219 --> 00:18:08.684]  I mean, every time I hear about somebody randomly killing their kids or randomly shooting a cop, every time they're on a cocktail of this crap.
[00:18:08.684 --> 00:18:09.544]  Every time!
[00:18:09.544 --> 00:18:10.985]  Every time!
[00:18:10.985 --> 00:18:12.146]  Every mass shooting.
[00:18:12.146 --> 00:18:13.086]  Every one of them.
[00:18:13.086 --> 00:18:20.611]  Harris and Kleibold and Kip Kinkle and the cutout shooter from Sandy Hook.
[00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:24.373]  Just every time.
[00:18:24.373 --> 00:18:28.375]  It says in the insert, you may become violent, smashing things, and threatening.
[00:18:32.927 --> 00:18:37.310]  Go read it for yourself, and then here's the other news on that front.
[00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.951]  Salon.
[00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:41.273]  White America must answer for the Charleston church massacre.
[00:18:41.273 --> 00:18:43.034]  See, it's a collective guilt.
[00:18:43.034 --> 00:18:49.579]  That's a telltale sign of an authoritarian regime when your neighbor does something wrong so you get punished too.
[00:18:49.579 --> 00:18:52.761]  Or a fascist regime, or a communist regime, anything totalitarian.
[00:18:52.761 --> 00:18:56.924]  The Nazis in occupied Poland and Ukraine and Russia, if
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:04.164]  A soldier got shot by a sniper in the town, they would kill ten people.
[00:19:04.164 --> 00:19:05.145]  Randomly.
[00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:11.810]  If an SS officer got killed, they'd kill a hundred or a thousand.
[00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.151]  And that's how this works.
[00:19:13.151 --> 00:19:16.394]  Oh, someone else did something bad with a gun, you're to blame.
[00:19:17.182 --> 00:19:22.447]  Then they get on the news and Obama goes, there's an epidemic, it's getting worse, nobody else has these problems.
[00:19:22.447 --> 00:19:28.093]  Crime using guns is down 61% according to Professor Lott and his statistics.
[00:19:28.093 --> 00:19:33.759]  We had a statistician do it, 51% since 92.
[00:19:33.759 --> 00:19:36.702]  He's more prestigious, one of the top living statisticians.
[00:19:39.514 --> 00:19:45.223]  But whatever, it's down 50 plus percent because we're in armed camp and criminals are scared.
[00:19:45.223 --> 00:19:46.365]  Where do they go though?
[00:19:46.365 --> 00:19:49.711]  A victim disarmament zone like a church.
[00:19:49.711 --> 00:19:51.694]  Because they're cowards.
[00:19:51.694 --> 00:19:52.435]  They don't come here.
[00:19:54.195 --> 00:19:59.341]  I mean, the M4 War Studios, I've got two 5.56 right here, a 500 Smith & Wesson.
[00:19:59.341 --> 00:20:05.649]  It's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the industry leader, My Patriot Supply.

[00:20:56.519 --> 00:20:57.681]  See you next time!
[00:21:10.942 --> 00:21:19.848]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.

[00:21:41.562 --> 00:21:43.123]  We've all heard the news stories.
[00:21:43.123 --> 00:21:44.244]  Another shooting.
[00:21:44.244 --> 00:21:45.964]  And they're getting worse.
[00:21:45.964 --> 00:21:49.526]  That's why Infidel Body Armor introduces Infidel Fridays.

[00:22:05.634 --> 00:22:08.355]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:22:10.168 --> 00:22:11.129]  Hey, Berkey Guy here.
[00:22:11.129 --> 00:22:12.970]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:14.730]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:16.692]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?
[00:22:16.692 --> 00:22:22.695]  The Berkey Guy is here to help you remove these and other potential contaminants from your water, thus helping you drink clean, purified water.
[00:22:22.695 --> 00:22:26.337]  We offer Berkey water purification systems at the lowest available prices online.
[00:22:26.337 --> 00:22:28.298]  Don't go another moment without a Berkey system.
[00:22:28.298 --> 00:22:31.400]  Over the last 10 years, we've helped thousands drink clean, purified water.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.661]  Join them by visiting GoBerkey.com or call me, the Berkey Guy, at 877-886-3653.
[00:22:34.661 --> 00:22:34.841]  That's 877-886-3653.
[00:22:40.049 --> 00:22:41.831]  Honey, it's time for dinner.
[00:22:41.831 --> 00:22:43.693]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[00:22:43.693 --> 00:22:45.194]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[00:22:45.194 --> 00:22:46.736]  Mine is falling apart.
[00:22:46.736 --> 00:22:52.902]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[00:22:52.902 --> 00:22:56.125]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[00:22:56.125 --> 00:22:56.646]  What is that?
[00:22:56.946 --> 00:23:06.493]  Well, apparently, many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[00:23:06.493 --> 00:23:15.219]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[00:23:15.219 --> 00:23:15.840]  Wow!
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.161]  That sounds scary!
[00:23:17.161 --> 00:23:21.624]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold shielded wallet.
[00:23:21.624 --> 00:23:22.425]  Are they more expensive?
[00:23:22.865 --> 00:23:23.385]  No.
[00:23:23.385 --> 00:23:31.070]  In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from IDStronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:32.251]  Sounds great!
[00:23:32.251 --> 00:23:34.872]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[00:23:34.872 --> 00:23:38.955]  I want to be protected, and these wallets at IDStronghold.com look fantastic!
[00:24:01.548 --> 00:24:02.630]  Stuff's getting weird.
[00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:05.393]  Thanks for joining us on this Friday edition of Alex Jones here live.
[00:24:05.393 --> 00:24:07.115]  I'll be live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:24:07.115 --> 00:24:07.476]  Central.
[00:24:07.476 --> 00:24:10.319]  You're watching us on TV.
[00:24:10.319 --> 00:24:15.446]  I have two HD firearms, two head-down firearms, both 5.56 in front of me.
[00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:21.292]  To just illustrate, these guns aren't going to shoot anybody.
[00:24:21.292 --> 00:24:25.974]  These rifles, these weapons, aren't going to attack anybody by themselves.
[00:24:25.974 --> 00:24:33.598]  And I know that's an idiotically obvious thing to say, but look at the logic of the people demonizing gun owners.
[00:24:33.598 --> 00:24:37.380]  They're now saying gun ownership is racist.
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:41.803]  No, disarming black people in the South at the end of the Civil War
[00:24:43.208 --> 00:24:44.248]  That was racist.
[00:24:44.248 --> 00:24:46.169]  The first gun laws were racist.
[00:24:46.169 --> 00:24:51.391]  Saying the NRA was a racist organization is, again, upside down.
[00:24:51.391 --> 00:24:52.851]  It's a total fraud.
[00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:57.472]  I'm not even going to get into the NRA's history.
[00:24:57.472 --> 00:25:05.075]  But everybody who's informed knows it was founded to arm blacks to fight the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:25:05.075 --> 00:25:05.855]  Again.
[00:25:05.855 --> 00:25:10.056]  And the party of the Ku Klux Klan, the Democrats, won our guns.
[00:25:10.056 --> 00:25:12.177]  And I'm not saying the Republicans are much better.
[00:25:13.456 --> 00:25:15.297]  The Republican Tea Party's great.
[00:25:15.297 --> 00:25:24.124]  That's why $50 million has been given the last year by the Republican leadership and their donors to destroy the Tea Party.
[00:25:24.124 --> 00:25:26.846]  Teaming up with the Democrats in closed-door meetings.
[00:25:26.846 --> 00:25:28.988]  Because the Tea Party doesn't want the TPP.
[00:25:28.988 --> 00:25:30.929]  The Tea Party doesn't want to turn over the guns.
[00:25:30.929 --> 00:25:37.575]  The Tea Party doesn't want to make the President a dictator who serves foreign interests.
[00:25:37.575 --> 00:25:42.699]  But we have to get that logic out to people and point out, hey, actual crime with guns is way down.
[00:25:43.703 --> 00:25:46.825]  Most black people are killed by other black people.
[00:25:46.825 --> 00:25:50.727]  And the media doesn't personalize other deaths.
[00:25:50.727 --> 00:26:10.818]  They've chosen to personalize this because Juneteenth's coming up, because the NAACP convention's coming up, and it's going to be all about galvanizing the black community to demand gun restrictions in America, to give Obama cover, like he did with his executive actions on amnesty.
[00:26:12.375 --> 00:26:13.896]  Hey, Congress wouldn't pass it?
[00:26:13.896 --> 00:26:16.277]  I changed the law.
[00:26:16.277 --> 00:26:18.498]  We have an intro that has those quotes.
[00:26:18.498 --> 00:26:20.259]  Maybe we should play it next segment.
[00:26:20.259 --> 00:26:23.681]  He said, I changed the law with actions I just took.
[00:26:23.681 --> 00:26:26.563]  And he says, I'm getting ready with gun control.
[00:26:26.563 --> 00:26:28.044]  Just give me time.
[00:26:28.044 --> 00:26:33.147]  I've got more than 18 executive actions I'm getting ready to take.
[00:26:33.147 --> 00:26:37.049]  So, they just tried to ban semi-autos.
[00:26:37.049 --> 00:26:38.650]  They just tried to shut down gun shows.
[00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:39.931]  They just tried all this.
[00:26:39.931 --> 00:26:40.571]  They're coming.
[00:26:42.079 --> 00:26:50.244]  Don't think just because we've had a couple victories against the gun grabbers that the war has been won.
[00:26:50.244 --> 00:26:55.407]  I told you last Friday when we shot down the TPP, they're going to be back next Thursday.
[00:26:55.407 --> 00:27:04.332]  And I was so busy trying to explain what was happening in the Second Amendment with this tragic shooting, with this dirtbag.
[00:27:04.332 --> 00:27:06.414]  Or he may be a victim.
[00:27:06.414 --> 00:27:08.995]  Though now I see him, he looks totally arrogant and whacked out.
[00:27:08.995 --> 00:27:10.456]  But drugs can do that to people as well.
[00:27:10.456 --> 00:27:11.637]  They can charge them up.
[00:27:13.356 --> 00:27:19.243]  Charlton Pastor fears riots after church shooting.
[00:27:19.243 --> 00:27:26.871]  But then when Matt Drudge talks about how race war is being pushed, the media comes out and demonizes him, saying that he's pushing race war.
[00:27:26.871 --> 00:27:28.994]  That article is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:27:30.097 --> 00:27:31.357]  Progressive tweets.
[00:27:31.357 --> 00:27:32.858]  Drudge trying to start race war.
[00:27:32.858 --> 00:27:48.602]  No, we and Drudge, anyone sensible, is exposing the push to create racial division and to rub salt in the wounds and to start a war against the police to destabilize local communities so they can come in and federalize things in Al Sharpton's own words.
[00:27:48.602 --> 00:27:50.623]  We are the restorationists.
[00:27:50.623 --> 00:27:53.904]  We're trying to stop a globalist takeover.
[00:27:53.904 --> 00:27:55.644]  We don't want destabilization.
[00:27:55.644 --> 00:27:57.765]  We don't get power out of that.
[00:27:57.765 --> 00:27:58.545]  We want freedom.
[00:27:59.949 --> 00:28:03.251]  And Joe Jennings wanted to talk about this.
[00:28:03.251 --> 00:28:06.812]  Again, it turns out Charlton Shooter was on a drug linked to violent outbursts.
[00:28:06.812 --> 00:28:09.694]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:28:09.694 --> 00:28:15.596]  And you told me before all this happened, what happened to your dad once they prescribed him this.
[00:28:15.596 --> 00:28:17.938]  Tell folks what it did to your father.
[00:28:17.938 --> 00:28:23.140]  Basically, you can't blame weapons as the cause of this.
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:26.882]  The biggest weapon is these prescription drugs.
[00:28:28.231 --> 00:28:36.318]  What they do is they turn somebody who's completely normal into another person.
[00:28:36.318 --> 00:28:41.122]  Just completely into a zombie that's suggestive.
[00:28:42.299 --> 00:28:46.742]  It's just sitting there not knowing what world they're in.
[00:28:46.742 --> 00:29:02.371]  So if you put a weapon in the hand of that person, the little voices inside their head, because of these prescription drugs like Suboxone, Zoloft, it's the cocktail mixture that just completely eradicates the people.
[00:29:02.371 --> 00:29:04.932]  Come back and tell us, because you wanted to share what happened to your father.
[00:29:04.932 --> 00:29:07.194]  You were saying completely normal, happy, healthy.
[00:29:07.194 --> 00:29:08.815]  He goes on Suboxone, just
[00:29:09.858 --> 00:29:10.899]  I mean, my dad's a dentist.
[00:29:10.899 --> 00:29:14.762]  He's retired, but they give people similar drugs in sedation dentistry.
[00:29:14.762 --> 00:29:17.564]  You could tell them, stick your hand in a light socket.
[00:29:17.564 --> 00:29:19.826]  You could tell them, jump off a cliff, they'll do it.
[00:29:19.826 --> 00:29:25.990]  And I said yesterday, if he's on an amnesiac, look out folks, this may be staged.
[00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:28.632]  Look at that graphic on Infowars.com.
[00:29:28.632 --> 00:29:30.033]  Mass murder pills.
[00:29:30.033 --> 00:29:30.854]  That's what they are.
[00:29:30.854 --> 00:29:32.235]  We're on the march.
[00:29:32.235 --> 00:29:34.757]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:34.757 --> 00:29:37.439]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:41.528 --> 00:29:45.350]  Obama's gun control will kill more blacks.
[00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:52.533]  President Barack Obama called for strict gun control in response to the Charleston, South Carolina church shooting.
[00:29:52.533 --> 00:29:55.894]  But that'll mean more deaths of African Americans.
[00:29:55.894 --> 00:30:03.898]  The president blames guns for the shooting which claimed nine lives at the historically black Emanuel AME church on Wednesday.
[00:30:04.298 --> 00:30:13.742]  However, the frequent violence which occurs in areas with strict gun laws totally debunks Obama's claim that gun control works.
[00:30:13.742 --> 00:30:16.823]  Simply put, more guns lead to less crime.
[00:30:16.823 --> 00:30:22.866]  Overall, guns are used 80 times more often to stop crime than they are used to kill people.
[00:30:23.066 --> 00:30:29.411]  Would you feel safer if you placed a sign on your door declaring that your home is a gun-free zone?
[00:30:29.411 --> 00:30:35.816]  Well, if not, then how could you possibly feel safer with those signs hanging up in public?
[00:30:35.816 --> 00:30:40.020]  You can learn more about these stories plus much more at InfoWars.com.
[00:30:41.263 --> 00:30:44.766]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:30:44.766 --> 00:30:53.012]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:30:53.012 --> 00:30:58.436]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:31:11.261 --> 00:31:12.281]  Alex Jones here.
[00:31:12.281 --> 00:31:21.545]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:31:21.545 --> 00:31:25.366]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[00:31:40.991 --> 00:31:46.738]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:31:46.738 --> 00:32:01.174]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:32:01.434 --> 00:32:09.437]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:32:09.437 --> 00:32:14.999]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:32:14.999 --> 00:32:18.580]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.702]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:32:22.702 --> 00:32:26.563]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:32:27.023 --> 00:32:31.146]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.
[00:32:31.146 --> 00:32:36.210]  Secure your Liver Shield today exclusively at Infowarslife.com for the lowest price available.

[00:32:38.291 --> 00:32:49.419]  And because early voting runs through this Friday, you don't have to wait until Election Day.
[00:32:49.419 --> 00:32:50.240]  You can vote all week!
[00:32:51.587 --> 00:33:00.813]  The Rio Riva County Clerk's Office reported this afternoon that a voter trying to cast an early ballot in Española today was told he had already voted three days prior.
[00:33:00.813 --> 00:33:10.180]  An activist on the tape goes on to suggest that discarded ballots could be collected from what she called Ghetto Aurora, saying that African Americans and Mexicans tend to throw out their ballots.
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:15.584]  And as for those programs we do need, I'll make them work better and I'll make them cost less.
[00:33:15.584 --> 00:33:24.071]  Thousands of federal workers are issued taxpayer-funded credit cards so long as they buy items that cost less than $3,000 or micro-purchases.
[00:33:24.071 --> 00:33:25.932]  Our review found about $20 billion.
[00:33:27.493 --> 00:33:29.094]  Just about the course of a year.
[00:33:29.094 --> 00:33:34.138]  We'll save billions by cutting waste and improving management and strengthening oversight.
[00:33:34.138 --> 00:33:37.940]  We asked all of these other major federal agencies based here in D.C.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:42.143]  for their micro-purchase shopping lists and all refused.
[00:33:42.143 --> 00:33:45.686]  I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half
[00:33:46.326 --> 00:33:48.228]  By the end of my first term in office.
[00:33:48.228 --> 00:33:55.174]  The Independent Congressional Budget Office warning a new fiscal crisis is coming if Washington doesn't get its spending in check.
[00:33:55.174 --> 00:34:00.819]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not increase our debt.
[00:34:00.819 --> 00:34:04.423]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[00:34:04.423 --> 00:34:06.925]  Somebody else made that happen.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:24.303]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios.
[00:34:24.303 --> 00:34:28.686]  First, Ebola is not spread through the air like the flu.
[00:34:28.686 --> 00:34:33.929]  Ebola is capable of entering human airway cells.
[00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:39.673]  Ebola is primed to be able to have respiratory transmission.
[00:34:39.673 --> 00:34:43.256]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:34:43.256 --> 00:34:45.237]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:45.237 --> 00:34:48.259]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:57.226]  By the way, Jesse Ventura called me yesterday breathless.
[00:34:57.226 --> 00:35:02.090]  I've never heard him like this.
[00:35:18.644 --> 00:35:21.426]  And he's going to be joining us in the next hour.
[00:35:21.426 --> 00:35:34.856]  We'll cover the waterfront with the former Minnesota governor who they've really tried to destroy and demonize and done a partial job of it saying he got arrested DWI in California when he doesn't drink fighting police.
[00:35:36.909 --> 00:35:37.890]  Just totally made up.
[00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:41.273]  And then that didn't work because he was in Minnesota and went on TV.
[00:35:41.273 --> 00:35:53.182]  And then they said that Chris Kyle beat him up because he was running around saying, I'm glad Navy SEALs are dead, when he'd been there speaking at their commencement.
[00:35:53.182 --> 00:35:55.744]  And then he sued and won.
[00:35:55.744 --> 00:36:04.271]  And the breaking news, this is not in the news yet, concerning the media and free speech, what's happened is unprecedented.
[00:36:06.175 --> 00:36:08.397]  He will be joining us in the next hour.
[00:36:08.397 --> 00:36:18.666]  It affects the media, it ties into the internet kill switch, it ties into web censorship, it ties into SOPA, CISPA, defamation, everything.
[00:36:18.666 --> 00:36:21.228]  It is incredible.
[00:36:21.228 --> 00:36:31.677]  And as soon as he called me at about four o'clock yesterday, I was out doing business errands and I pulled over
[00:36:33.083 --> 00:36:35.064]  Did a search and he was correct.
[00:36:35.064 --> 00:36:39.388]  It was not in the news and I was back and forth with Ventura and his lawyer.
[00:36:39.388 --> 00:36:43.891]  He was on the other line with his lawyer on another phone back and forth.
[00:36:43.891 --> 00:36:49.975]  Just deciding on whether or not he can go public with this and that decision has been made on this broadcast.
[00:36:49.975 --> 00:36:51.917]  I should have announced this right at the start.
[00:36:51.917 --> 00:36:56.700]  In fact, we need to tweet that.
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:02.024]  Jesse Ventura will be joining us with exclusive news concerning a massive attack on the First Amendment.
[00:37:03.444 --> 00:37:13.992]  Or that we're going to be breaking a very important story concerning the future of free speech in this country.
[00:37:13.992 --> 00:37:22.958]  Basically, in fact it's so big, I don't even have words to describe what to send out on Twitter.
[00:37:22.958 --> 00:37:31.805]  The media are petitioning the court to codify in federal law
[00:37:33.697 --> 00:37:49.855]  That you are allowed to lie and that you cannot be found liable but only if you're establishment media.
[00:37:49.855 --> 00:37:55.081]  And he has the amicus brief that has been
[00:37:56.806 --> 00:38:04.071]  Put into the court case on the appeal by 50 top media outlets to overturn his case.
[00:38:04.071 --> 00:38:10.836]  That's all I'm going to say right there, but this is a big deal.
[00:38:10.836 --> 00:38:15.840]  A jury found that he was defamed.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.241]  They called in the witnesses.
[00:38:17.241 --> 00:38:18.922]  It was, they all said different things.
[00:38:18.922 --> 00:38:19.683]  It wasn't true.
[00:38:21.567 --> 00:38:28.989]  Kyle changed his story, the insurance company, now just the books made over 70 million.
[00:38:28.989 --> 00:38:32.130]  The movie, 200 and something million.
[00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:34.090]  Ventura just got a million and a half.
[00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:36.551]  It cost him a million dollars to sue.
[00:38:36.551 --> 00:38:39.231]  You know I'm supposed to say that.
[00:38:39.231 --> 00:38:41.972]  The point is, it was all about his name.
[00:38:41.972 --> 00:38:43.252]  Ventura's got plenty of money.
[00:38:43.252 --> 00:38:47.553]  He did land deals, you name it, media things, I mean the guy's loaded.
[00:38:47.553 --> 00:38:49.314]  And he did this because it's not true.
[00:38:50.134 --> 00:38:54.315]  And he talked to Kyle personally before he died and said, stop lying!
[00:38:54.315 --> 00:38:56.615]  I've never met you!
[00:38:56.615 --> 00:38:59.476]  He's been in the room with him, stop it!
[00:38:59.476 --> 00:39:02.297]  And Kyle would not do it, so they killed him.
[00:39:02.297 --> 00:39:11.779]  And had a PTSD vet to fit the whole narrative so they could have their movie and have their hero, when the book has been proven, not just the Ventura part, to be a load of horse crap.
[00:39:15.276 --> 00:39:26.621]  And as much as I like Texans, and as much as I like rodeo riders, as much as I like tough guys from Texas, I mean this is a story made for people like me.
[00:39:26.621 --> 00:39:30.363]  I got family a lot like Chris Kyle, the real deal.
[00:39:30.363 --> 00:39:39.368]  And Chris Kyle was brave, did a lot of stuff, but a bunch of his book was hyped up just like Private Lynch, just like Pat Tillman wouldn't go along with it, they killed him.
[00:39:39.368 --> 00:39:39.888]  They killed
[00:39:42.549 --> 00:39:48.694]  Four members of her team to shut them up, but then it still came out it was all fake.
[00:39:48.694 --> 00:39:51.977]  Like you can see my whole American Sniper exposed as giant hoax.
[00:39:51.977 --> 00:39:54.459]  That's coming up.
[00:39:54.459 --> 00:39:58.802]  And this ties in to everything.
[00:39:58.802 --> 00:40:01.664]  But now it's about free speech and a huge case.
[00:40:01.664 --> 00:40:07.309]  So Jesse Ventura will be joining us on that front and more.
[00:40:07.309 --> 00:40:07.970]  But while
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:16.202]  We're busy talking about the nine people that are dead.
[00:40:16.202 --> 00:40:21.364]  Why aren't we talking about the hundreds?
[00:40:21.364 --> 00:40:28.706]  I was looking at the numbers, it's something like 300 plus blacks get shot by other blacks a year and killed.
[00:40:28.706 --> 00:40:30.186]  Thousands get shot.
[00:40:30.186 --> 00:40:35.508]  In Chicago, in the city proper, not counting all the suburbs.
[00:40:35.508 --> 00:40:38.369]  There's no speeches, there's no discussion, there's no talk.
[00:40:40.071 --> 00:40:45.912]  About trying to stop that, or the 14 million dead black babies that have been aborted since Roe v. Wade.
[00:40:45.912 --> 00:40:49.713]  Some numbers are even higher.
[00:40:49.713 --> 00:40:56.855]  It's all just these nine people as if it's the end of the world, because the media tells us when to get upset, when to get angry.
[00:40:56.855 --> 00:41:00.655]  Here are the headlines, and we're going back to Joe Jennings.
[00:41:00.655 --> 00:41:03.376]  Charlton Shooter was on drug-linked to violent outburst.
[00:41:03.376 --> 00:41:07.177]  Surprise, surprise, as Gomer Pyle likes to say.
[00:41:08.607 --> 00:41:10.169]  House approves fast-track 218 to 208.
[00:41:10.169 --> 00:41:11.350]  Sending mail to the Senate.
[00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:12.471]  Devastating.
[00:41:16.633 --> 00:41:20.874]  But Salon says white America must answer for the Charlton Church massacre.
[00:41:20.874 --> 00:41:21.814]  That's right.
[00:41:21.814 --> 00:41:24.074]  You're all collectively bad.
[00:41:24.074 --> 00:41:27.855]  So I guess when a black person does something wrong, all black people are collectively bad.
[00:41:27.855 --> 00:41:34.616]  Or Hitler was bad, so now all Germans or Austrians today are guilty.
[00:41:34.616 --> 00:41:35.656]  No, they're not.
[00:41:35.656 --> 00:41:38.257]  In fact, a two-year-old Austrian baby is guilty for Hitler.
[00:41:38.257 --> 00:41:40.237]  No, he's not.
[00:41:40.237 --> 00:41:41.137]  I'm not guilty.
[00:41:41.137 --> 00:41:43.398]  I've done nothing but try to help people.
[00:41:43.398 --> 00:41:44.498]  I don't have any guilt.
[00:41:44.498 --> 00:41:45.198]  I'm sick of it.
[00:41:50.532 --> 00:41:57.917]  I was raised around this intense culture of white guilt that just permeates Christians.
[00:41:57.917 --> 00:42:01.240]  My family are Christians across the board, and I'm sick of it.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:05.463]  I haven't done jack crap to anybody.
[00:42:05.463 --> 00:42:08.765]  In fact, I bet you money there are few living black people.
[00:42:10.421 --> 00:42:15.762]  That have been abused by white people as much as I have been abused by black people.
[00:42:15.762 --> 00:42:20.943]  And again, I was attacked by redneck gangs, some fights with Mexican gangs.
[00:42:20.943 --> 00:42:24.204]  I didn't realize it was gangs at the time, but people, they didn't know they were in gangs.
[00:42:24.204 --> 00:42:25.464]  It's just gang behavior.
[00:42:25.464 --> 00:42:26.624]  It's mob psychology.
[00:42:26.624 --> 00:42:28.524]  That's what a race war is.
[00:42:28.524 --> 00:42:30.825]  But I grew up in Dallas, Texas.
[00:42:30.825 --> 00:42:35.786]  I was probably in 200 fights, maybe 50 of them seriously deadly by the time I was 16.
[00:42:35.786 --> 00:42:37.126]  And you know, they were real fights.
[00:42:39.346 --> 00:42:41.708]  But I was beat up.
[00:42:41.708 --> 00:42:43.950]  I was thinking about the other day, you know, did I exaggerate saying 200?
[00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:44.751]  No.
[00:42:44.751 --> 00:42:51.737]  I probably got attacked from 6th grade to 8th grade until I really started hurting people and I fought back.
[00:42:51.737 --> 00:42:53.518]  Then people started backing off.
[00:42:53.518 --> 00:42:55.300]  By kids that had flunked 3 grades.
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.762]  It didn't matter if they were rednecks or blacks.
[00:42:57.762 --> 00:43:01.085]  It wasn't so much the Mexicans doing it.
[00:43:01.085 --> 00:43:02.986]  Though I got in some run-ins with them.
[00:43:02.986 --> 00:43:05.088]  I was constantly fighting blacks and rednecks.
[00:43:05.088 --> 00:43:06.509]  And it was, they acted just the same.
[00:43:07.213 --> 00:43:15.897]  You know, it'd be like five rednecks or five blacks, they'd shoot their mouth off, trip you, run your head in the wall, you start fighting one, beat one up, they all jump on you.
[00:43:15.897 --> 00:43:19.198]  And I'm, you know, I'm just tired of it.
[00:43:19.198 --> 00:43:26.521]  But I don't sit here hating black people because I've had black people attacking me saying, I'm gonna beat your brains out, Cracker.
[00:43:26.521 --> 00:43:28.242]  They were racist, they were bad.
[00:43:28.242 --> 00:43:31.003]  And it's the same violent black people that are preying on black people.
[00:43:32.759 --> 00:43:40.220]  But I just, how many black people out there have been in probably, have had white people physically attack them?
[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.301]  I don't want to exaggerate.
[00:43:42.301 --> 00:43:47.162]  I'd say 200, 300 total fights, 100, maybe 50 were really hardcore.
[00:43:47.162 --> 00:43:50.782]  I've been in the hospital probably 15 times fighting.
[00:43:50.782 --> 00:43:52.003]  The hospital.
[00:43:52.003 --> 00:43:52.603]  Broken bones.
[00:43:52.603 --> 00:43:59.404]  I mean, I've been on the ambulance when the person's trached next to me, or when their brain's hanging out.
[00:44:00.458 --> 00:44:03.119]  And I got blood coming out of my eyes and can't see.
[00:44:03.119 --> 00:44:13.443]  I mean, I've been in savage Conan the Barbarian fights growing up in Dallas, Texas, ladies and gentlemen, and it was almost always racial or territorial.
[00:44:13.443 --> 00:44:20.786]  I bet I've been beat up when I was little by black gangs 50 times.
[00:44:20.786 --> 00:44:27.088]  And I've probably been in fights where I was older and fought back probably 35, 40 times with black people.
[00:44:29.815 --> 00:44:31.456]  I mean, just savage fights.
[00:44:31.456 --> 00:44:33.978]  We're trying to kill each other.
[00:44:33.978 --> 00:44:35.579]  No holds barred.
[00:44:35.579 --> 00:44:37.000]  Banging heads in concrete.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.782]  Because if you don't bang their heads, they're going to bang your head.
[00:44:41.169 --> 00:44:43.150]  I mean, where am I, whining and complaining?
[00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.610]  I'm not!
[00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:45.731]  I'm just sick of hearing about it!
[00:44:45.731 --> 00:44:47.252]  I'm tired of it!
[00:44:47.252 --> 00:44:58.177]  And then you put, watch out people, black or white or whatever, on drugs that make people kill people, or highly suggestible, and then you say white people are to blame?
[00:44:58.177 --> 00:45:02.939]  When as a white person, I am eight times more likely to be attacked by a black person.
[00:45:02.939 --> 00:45:07.181]  And I'll say it again, I don't blame the general black public, they're scared of these thugs.
[00:45:07.181 --> 00:45:10.163]  I can't go to the nicer restaurants, they've got a whole bunch of them,
[00:45:11.556 --> 00:45:20.642]  In East Austin that they've built the last 10 years because they got black thugs going around trying to shake people down and mug folks.
[00:45:20.642 --> 00:45:32.510]  The last three times now I've been down there past seven o'clock at night I have been approached by a black guys over six feet 250 pounds going I need some money I need it right now.
[00:45:33.609 --> 00:45:36.891]  You're like, I'm not gonna give you money, and they start blowing up, I need it right now!
[00:45:36.891 --> 00:45:41.053]  They don't say give it to me or I'm gonna attack you, they just, I'm gonna give it, I need the money right now!
[00:45:41.053 --> 00:45:42.794]  Like, you know, that's a nice watch.
[00:45:42.794 --> 00:45:43.755]  Same thing happens in New York.
[00:45:43.755 --> 00:45:48.118]  It's happened to Rob Jacobson a bunch, on the train growing up, and going to work.
[00:45:48.118 --> 00:45:51.159]  Almost always, black guys.
[00:45:51.159 --> 00:45:57.103]  Because there's this attitude that they are allowed to do it because you're white, because you deserve it.
[00:45:58.649 --> 00:46:04.010]  Now, I'm not a racist, so I don't blame black people in general, because most black people aren't like that.
[00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:06.491]  They get fed on by these same thugs as well.
[00:46:06.491 --> 00:46:11.772]  But there is a thug culture that's accepted in this country, and there's whites doing it as well.
[00:46:11.772 --> 00:46:18.294]  I told you, rednecks in bad areas of East Texas and Dallas act just like black gangs.
[00:46:18.294 --> 00:46:21.195]  They are so much alike, and they hate each other, of course.
[00:46:21.195 --> 00:46:22.815]  They hate everybody.
[00:46:22.815 --> 00:46:26.636]  And I'm kind of ranting here, it's just that's what I'm getting at.
[00:46:28.874 --> 00:46:31.115]  Now, I wanted to go back to Joe Jennings.
[00:46:31.115 --> 00:46:35.836]  If you just joined us, he's one of our great producers back there and runs the audio board.
[00:46:35.836 --> 00:46:45.940]  He was talking about his dad who recently died, and he was on the same drug that the reported shooter, the dirtbag, Dylan Storm Roof, was on.
[00:46:49.144 --> 00:46:55.930]  And usually with a middle name like Storm, that's either a family name or it's a white supremacist handle.
[00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:58.712]  He's obviously wound up by somebody.
[00:46:58.712 --> 00:47:03.296]  I said yesterday, he's probably on an amnesia and he wanted to start a race war.
[00:47:03.296 --> 00:47:05.077]  Now that's admitted.
[00:47:05.077 --> 00:47:07.820]  Let's go ahead and get your take on this drug, Joe Jennings.
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:11.963]  Hey Alex, guess what prescription drug doesn't care about?
[00:47:11.963 --> 00:47:12.383]  What?
[00:47:12.383 --> 00:47:13.464]  What race you are.
[00:47:13.464 --> 00:47:14.925]  That's right.
[00:47:14.925 --> 00:47:15.346]  Doesn't care.
[00:47:16.542 --> 00:47:19.065]  It just turns you into whatever it wants you to.
[00:47:19.065 --> 00:47:22.129]  If people want to be mad, you need to be mad at Big Pharma.
[00:47:22.129 --> 00:47:33.043]  You need to be mad at these doctors that are prescribing this crap, this mind-altering junk, to fill a void in these people that there's nothing wrong with.
[00:47:35.001 --> 00:47:36.802]  It's an incredible epidemic.
[00:47:36.802 --> 00:47:43.107]  First it started with, he was addicted to Vicodin, which was given to him from doctors like it was candy.
[00:47:43.107 --> 00:47:43.948]  Oh here, take this.
[00:47:43.948 --> 00:47:45.349]  This is Vicodin.
[00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:46.670]  Here, take it.
[00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:54.977]  So he had to get on Suboxone, which is very similar to a methadone.
[00:47:54.977 --> 00:47:59.061]  Sure, they invented heroin at the end of the Civil War to get the troops off opium.
[00:47:59.061 --> 00:48:00.702]  It's about eight times stronger.
[00:48:00.702 --> 00:48:02.624]  So they get you off one narcotic with another.
[00:48:03.243 --> 00:48:05.704]  Oh yeah, and it's a Schedule II.
[00:48:05.704 --> 00:48:13.567]  He had a heck of a time getting any doctor, and I'm talking, he had to go to different states to get a doctor to prescribe it for him.
[00:48:13.567 --> 00:48:15.048]  None of them want to touch it.
[00:48:15.048 --> 00:48:17.229]  But now, oh, take this.
[00:48:17.229 --> 00:48:19.089]  It's this new drug, Suboxone.
[00:48:19.089 --> 00:48:20.110]  It's good for you.
[00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:22.050]  Take it.
[00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:30.534]  What I don't understand, and none of my family understand, is how can a healthy person who's, you know, he was 70 years old, die
[00:48:31.494 --> 00:48:38.439]  In three months from brain cancer that is not genetically in our family, not from anything.
[00:48:38.439 --> 00:48:41.922]  He was on Suboxone for quite a while.
[00:48:41.922 --> 00:48:45.324]  And other antidepressants and other things.
[00:48:45.324 --> 00:48:49.427]  It's a mixture, it's a cocktail of all these different prescription drugs that they give you.
[00:48:49.427 --> 00:48:51.869]  Take this to counteract this.
[00:48:51.869 --> 00:48:55.131]  But Suboxone was the worst out of all of them.
[00:48:55.131 --> 00:48:59.955]  And now they admit drug overdoses are exploding from prescription drugs across the United States.
[00:49:00.908 --> 00:49:02.369]  Oh yeah.
[00:49:02.369 --> 00:49:06.993]  My mom told me one time, because Suboxone was sublingual, so it's like the Listerine strip.
[00:49:06.993 --> 00:49:10.396]  You just put it on your tongue, and it goes straight into your bloodstream.
[00:49:10.396 --> 00:49:15.100]  She said she gave my dad a kiss, and he forgot to tell her that he just took it.
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:19.023]  That drug knocked my mom out for four hours.
[00:49:19.023 --> 00:49:21.285]  She couldn't move.
[00:49:21.285 --> 00:49:24.948]  Now, these people take it daily.
[00:49:24.948 --> 00:49:26.209]  What do you think it's doing to them?
[00:49:26.209 --> 00:49:27.911]  And she just got a fraction of it.
[00:49:27.911 --> 00:49:29.052]  Oh yeah, just a little.
[00:49:32.005 --> 00:49:39.509]  Can you imagine what somebody with a weapon, any weapon, is going to do when they're on that drug?
[00:49:39.509 --> 00:49:42.070]  It's not them.
[00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:44.111]  It's not the person that they really are.
[00:49:44.111 --> 00:49:45.192]  It's being masked.
[00:49:45.192 --> 00:49:47.473]  It's being controlled.
[00:49:47.473 --> 00:49:54.556]  It's being just... It's obliterating anything that they are.
[00:49:54.556 --> 00:49:55.177]  But it's okay.
[00:49:56.263 --> 00:49:57.464]  It's good for you.
[00:49:57.464 --> 00:50:06.288]  And the very same government that is controlled by Big Pharma, it's cell phone by big mega banks, are shipping in the major narcotics.
[00:50:06.288 --> 00:50:09.590]  And then it destroys our society just like the drug wars destroyed Mexico.
[00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:15.272]  It's not that we're for these drugs, the drug pushers made the drugs illegal to make larger profits off of it.
[00:50:15.272 --> 00:50:18.234]  Well I'm sorry about your father, but your warning certainly will help others.
[00:50:18.234 --> 00:50:19.815]  Thank you so much Joe Jennings.
[00:50:19.815 --> 00:50:20.155]  Thanks Alex.
[00:50:23.672 --> 00:50:25.653]  We have Jesse Ventura joining us.
[00:50:25.653 --> 00:50:28.875]  I had Reverend Childress on of blackgenocide.org yesterday.
[00:50:28.875 --> 00:50:30.696]  His insight was so powerful.
[00:50:30.696 --> 00:50:34.538]  I'm inviting him back on the third hour today, blackgenocide.org.
[00:50:34.538 --> 00:50:36.959]  He's coming up today and we'll open the phones up.
[00:50:36.959 --> 00:50:38.860]  I apologize for not getting to those calls yesterday.
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:39.741]  I really do.
[00:50:41.656 --> 00:50:43.777]  So the phone rings, and I pick it up, and it's Mark.
[00:50:43.777 --> 00:50:49.139]  And Mark says to me, hey, third Sunday, June, Father's Day, I ordered Dad a gun.
[00:50:49.139 --> 00:50:50.019]  It's here.
[00:50:50.019 --> 00:50:52.760]  He's going to build it out, and we're going to go out on Father's Day shooting.
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:53.400]  You want to come?
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:54.320]  And I said, yeah.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:59.162]  What a great idea for a Father's Day gift, an AR-15 rifle kit from Guns80.com.
[00:50:59.162 --> 00:51:00.202]  I think I'll get my dad one.
[00:51:00.202 --> 00:51:01.163]  He says, go ahead.
[00:51:01.163 --> 00:51:01.923]  See you out on the range.
[00:51:01.923 --> 00:51:03.824]  So we're going to meet on the range on Father's Day.
[00:51:03.824 --> 00:51:07.285]  Get your dad an AR-15 rifle kit at Guns80.com, Guns80.com, or call 844-2GUNS80.

[00:53:48.081 --> 00:53:49.082]  Almost every day.
[00:53:49.082 --> 00:53:57.206]  I see a story that's a Rosetta Stone.
[00:53:57.206 --> 00:53:58.647]  I talk a lot about that.
[00:53:58.647 --> 00:54:01.888]  A decoding article that takes you deep into what's happening.
[00:54:01.888 --> 00:54:08.692]  Later in the broadcast, I will get into this Bloomberg article that's linked up on Infowars.com that is so important.
[00:54:08.692 --> 00:54:11.794]  They try to make a joke out of it in Bloomberg.
[00:54:11.794 --> 00:54:14.475]  There's a pile of gold in Manhattan.
[00:54:14.475 --> 00:54:15.616]  Texas wants it back.
[00:54:18.393 --> 00:54:25.256]  Texas is to repatriate a billion dollars of gold bullion, 5,600 bars of precious metal.
[00:54:25.256 --> 00:54:35.181]  They go on to say Texas is stable and we're doing this to show that we can, I mean go read it, basically stabilize the state during a collapse.
[00:54:35.181 --> 00:54:42.265]  The Russians and Chinese want their gold back out of the quote Federal Reserve vaults, the private Federal Reserve vaults.
[00:54:44.904 --> 00:54:48.266]  And they make it a Texas versus the North thing.
[00:54:48.266 --> 00:54:52.808]  Texas wants its gold back from the Yankees, wherever they're keeping it.
[00:54:52.808 --> 00:54:59.431]  Governor Greg Abbott signed a law last week to build a depository for 5,600 bars of the precious metal.
[00:54:59.431 --> 00:55:03.993]  As he said in a statement, repatriate one billion of gold from the Federal Reserve in New York.
[00:55:03.993 --> 00:55:06.374]  See, Abbott knows the Federal Reserve's private.
[00:55:06.374 --> 00:55:07.454]  He's a patriot.
[00:55:07.454 --> 00:55:08.855]  He's anti-New World Order.
[00:55:08.855 --> 00:55:11.576]  They hate him.
[00:55:11.576 --> 00:55:12.577]  We've never
[00:55:13.686 --> 00:55:24.111]  Had a governor like this, not in the whole history of Texas, because they didn't need to be anti-New World Order before there wasn't a total takeover.
[00:55:24.111 --> 00:55:25.771]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[00:55:25.771 --> 00:55:28.072]  They really hate the governor.
[00:55:28.072 --> 00:55:29.833]  He needs serious security.
[00:55:29.833 --> 00:55:31.454]  I know he does have it.
[00:55:31.454 --> 00:55:37.157]  But they know he's for real, folks, and they know he knows what's going on.
[00:55:37.157 --> 00:55:42.399]  You know, I got one of his billionaire associates in here the other day, and
[00:55:45.566 --> 00:55:51.590]  He was on air, and he wouldn't go all the way talking about the governor and the stuff, but I know other sources with the governor as well.
[00:55:51.590 --> 00:55:57.013]  I've met the governor before, and I also run into his chief of staff quite a bit, but none of that's an issue.
[00:55:57.013 --> 00:56:04.737]  The point is, he knows what's going on, and a lot of Texas lawmakers know what's going on, and they don't want to sell the country out.
[00:56:04.737 --> 00:56:07.359]  They know the plan is to collapse the country into a depression.
[00:56:07.359 --> 00:56:08.540]  They want prosperity!
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:09.340]  They want freedom!
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:11.221]  They want Americana!
[00:56:11.221 --> 00:56:12.302]  They're not bad people!
[00:56:13.959 --> 00:56:20.647]  And it's getting clearer and clearer that this is happening, but they spin it like Texas doesn't like New York.
[00:56:20.647 --> 00:56:23.210]  That gold doesn't help New York City.
[00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:25.873]  It's in the private Federal Reserve bank vaults.
[00:56:25.873 --> 00:56:29.036]  The Federal Reserve's over 60% foreign-owned.
[00:56:29.036 --> 00:56:29.737]  It's not federal.
[00:56:29.737 --> 00:56:33.782]  I know I keep saying that, but just everything they do is a lie.
[00:56:33.782 --> 00:56:34.462]  And here's the word.
[00:56:35.399 --> 00:56:43.524]  More and more gold that's been expatriated out of New York vaults turns out to be gold-plated tungsten that weighs the same as gold.
[00:56:43.524 --> 00:56:44.225]  It's atomic weight.
[00:56:46.601 --> 00:56:59.353]  So there's a major scandal here, and that's exactly what our different guests have been talking about, how they're trying to ban physical gold in the EU and stuff, starting in Spain, because the world is getting ready to melt down.
[00:56:59.353 --> 00:57:00.635]  We've never been closer.
[00:57:00.635 --> 00:57:02.336]  Ron Paul's on CNBC today.
[00:57:02.336 --> 00:57:03.958]  Let me give you the exact quote.
[00:57:03.958 --> 00:57:05.619]  I've got it here.
[00:57:05.619 --> 00:57:09.403]  Just saying that we're on the edge.
[00:57:09.403 --> 00:57:09.984]  Can't find it.
[00:57:09.984 --> 00:57:10.985]  I read the actual quote earlier.
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:13.241]  It's on screen.
[00:57:13.241 --> 00:57:17.947]  Ron Paul, Stock Market Day of Reckoning is near.
[00:57:17.947 --> 00:57:18.588]  You bet it is!
[00:57:19.875 --> 00:57:25.319]  We're on top of a big, fat house of cards and the globalists are scurrying around robbing what they can here in the endgame.
[00:57:25.319 --> 00:57:27.120]  I mean, this is a crazy time.
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:29.982]  This is where we're going to find out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are.
[00:57:29.982 --> 00:57:37.827]  Separately, it's more important than ever and I want to thank you for your support of InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV shows, all we do in this fight.

[00:57:50.676 --> 00:57:56.602]  Tinctures that are known to open up your liver on a daily basis and get it to flush out toxins.
[00:57:56.602 --> 00:57:58.985]  Though I do not recommend you heavily drink when you're on this.
[00:57:58.985 --> 00:58:04.671]  I mean, folks that take it say if they're on it and drink it has a lot bigger effect because the liver is opening up.
[00:58:04.671 --> 00:58:07.954]  So you do not need to drink when you're doing this, I'll just tell folks.
[00:58:08.715 --> 00:58:10.676]  Well, I'm not going to advise you.
[00:58:10.676 --> 00:58:11.716]  Talk to your physician.

[00:59:47.438 --> 00:59:52.282]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:52.282 --> 00:59:53.863]  You want answers?
[00:59:53.863 --> 00:59:55.404]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:55.404 --> 00:59:59.608]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:59.608 --> 01:00:03.651]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:10.356 --> 01:00:12.817]  Huge news dealing with the First Amendment.
[01:00:12.817 --> 01:00:14.378]  Really unprecedented.
[01:00:14.378 --> 01:00:19.019]  Coming up in the next segment with former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:00:19.019 --> 01:00:23.981]  We'll get his take on the situation in South Carolina, the tragic shootings.
[01:00:23.981 --> 01:00:27.222]  This 9-DAD that took place Wednesday night.
[01:00:27.222 --> 01:00:29.663]  And the aftermath of that.
[01:00:29.663 --> 01:00:32.024]  We'll look at the situation in the Middle East.
[01:00:32.024 --> 01:00:36.346]  We'll look at French invent robots to replace border police.
[01:00:37.756 --> 01:00:42.260]  There's again another massive move to open up the borders right now.
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:43.942]  It's already been done with executive action.
[01:00:43.942 --> 01:00:46.905]  We're trying to ram that through Congress.
[01:00:46.905 --> 01:00:50.408]  I got really happy about this, but I said the fight was coming up again next week.
[01:00:50.408 --> 01:00:57.675]  While we were busy diverted by the tragic events in South Carolina, America came inches closer, because we're only a few inches away.
[01:00:59.873 --> 01:01:02.855]  From being conquered by the TPP.
[01:01:02.855 --> 01:01:09.600]  I mean, this is a total takeover of everything in our country, basically, by foreign shadowy groups and a secret treaty.
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:15.524]  It is just so awesome, in a bad way, what they're getting away with.
[01:01:15.524 --> 01:01:20.968]  House approves fast-track 218 to 208.
[01:01:20.968 --> 01:01:25.090]  I saw that in the afternoon yesterday and I was like in the pit of my stomach.
[01:01:25.090 --> 01:01:26.111]  I just felt nauseated.
[01:01:26.111 --> 01:01:28.673]  I had Larry Nichols on, former top Clinton insider.
[01:01:30.799 --> 01:01:47.486]  And I wasn't feeling so much defeated, just sad that we're so conquered and it's getting so much worse and the rapacious, predatory, vicious hatred of prosperity and freedom that the criminal class has that's in control.
[01:01:47.486 --> 01:01:52.228]  And just to know that, man, we either route these people and push them back and
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:57.004]  Prosecute him and bring him to justice or it's just all going to collapse.
[01:01:57.004 --> 01:01:59.327]  And we've reached that point.
[01:01:59.327 --> 01:02:01.910]  We can't go much further.
[01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:03.312]  Because the bottom is dropping out.
[01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:09.694]  The House on Thursday took the first step towards resurrecting the White House trade agenda.
[01:02:09.694 --> 01:02:16.760]  It's not trade, it's a takeover, but see the lapdog media goes along with that, by passing legislation granting President Obama fast-track authority.
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:23.666]  The bill now goes to the Senate, where the White House and GOP leaders are seeking to strike a deal with pro-trade Democrats.
[01:02:23.666 --> 01:02:25.268]  It's not trade.
[01:02:25.268 --> 01:02:26.389]  The whole article is written to deceive.
[01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:32.220]  The House voted 218-208 with 28 Democrats voting for it.
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:36.402]  This is the second time in a week the House has voted to approve the controversial Fast Track bill.
[01:02:36.402 --> 01:02:38.643]  And when you fail, just do it again!
[01:02:38.643 --> 01:02:50.289]  On Friday, the House voted 219-211 in favor of Fast Track, which would make it easier for Obama to complete the sweeping Trans-Pacific Trade deal.
[01:02:50.289 --> 01:02:51.590]  In last week's vote, the GOP
[01:02:53.462 --> 01:03:00.986]  Parried with Fast Track Bill with the measure known as Trade Adjustment Assistance, TAA, that gives aid to workers displaced by trade.
[01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:06.289]  Oh, here's some money for retraining, but you're going to lose your job forever.
[01:03:06.289 --> 01:03:08.170]  Here's your last meal.
[01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:12.773]  Both measures needed to be approved in separate votes for the entire package to move forward.
[01:03:13.533 --> 01:03:21.457]  House Democrats have historically favored TAA, but they voted against it Friday to kill Fast Track, which is deeply opposed by unions and other liberal groups.
[01:03:21.457 --> 01:03:32.441]  Yeah, unions have already sold themselves out to NAFTA and GATT and other things, and they're pretty much compromised and controlled and, you know, support gun control and open borders and all sorts of suicidal behavior.
[01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:40.205]  But now, at the end, they get a secret bill we can't read, and three sections of it that, if leaked, say that foreign groups will dictate everything?
[01:03:40.205 --> 01:03:42.666]  No, we've got to reverse this.
[01:03:44.676 --> 01:03:46.578]  And that's now basically what's happened.
[01:03:46.578 --> 01:03:51.704]  Again, if you're a TV viewer or a radio listener, you can go to Infowars.com forward slash show and be a TV viewer.
[01:03:51.704 --> 01:03:53.086]  It's free.
[01:03:53.086 --> 01:04:00.414]  You can see I've got two HDfirearms.com super high quality but also affordable 5.56 rifles.
[01:04:00.414 --> 01:04:05.100]  And we just have these out here today because the new attack on guns is here.
[01:04:06.522 --> 01:04:10.565]  Let it be known that the next shoot-a-drop is now dropping.
[01:04:10.565 --> 01:04:18.392]  The trial balloons are done, the new assault with legislation and executive orders to restrict the Second Amendment is on.
[01:04:18.392 --> 01:04:32.223]  And we'll talk to former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura about that, about openly funding Al-Qaeda, about the build-up for war with Russia, about a huge massive attack on the First Amendment, that's why he's really joining us, and so much more.
[01:04:32.223 --> 01:04:34.165]  Election 2016, the shootings,
[01:04:36.126 --> 01:04:37.287]  ...happening around the country.
[01:04:37.287 --> 01:04:42.889]  It's all coming up with Jesse Ventura.
[01:04:42.889 --> 01:04:54.615]  ISIS, blatantly supported by John McCain and the Pentagon, and hesitantly supplied tanks, rocket launchers, missile and anti-aircraft systems in accidental airdrops.
[01:04:54.615 --> 01:04:58.757]  They're just sending arms, very frankly, although they need them very badly.
[01:04:58.757 --> 01:05:00.838]  They need anti-tank and anti-air weapons.
[01:05:01.718 --> 01:05:06.102]  ...is not going to change the situation on the ground and the massacre goes on.
[01:05:06.102 --> 01:05:13.668]  Now it has been confirmed that ISIS has stockpiled enough radioactive material to create weapons of mass destruction.
[01:05:13.668 --> 01:05:27.639]  In the ISIS magazine Dabiq, ISIS declared their intent to acquire a nuclear warhead from Pakistan with their billions of stolen funds, gobbled up as they ransacked banks and took control of oil fields across Iraq and Syria.
[01:05:27.919 --> 01:05:37.629]  ISIS claims that all they have to do is call on their leaders in Pakistan to purchase a nuclear device through weapons dealers with links to corrupt officials in the region.
[01:05:37.629 --> 01:05:39.651]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[01:05:41.243 --> 01:05:47.008]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.

[01:06:39.819 --> 01:06:51.305]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[01:06:51.505 --> 01:06:58.608]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:06:58.608 --> 01:07:03.489]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:03.489 --> 01:07:10.272]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:10.272 --> 01:07:17.434]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:17.434 --> 01:07:19.155]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:24.457]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:28.939]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:07:28.939 --> 01:07:32.340]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:38.643]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:07:38.643 --> 01:07:40.304]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:44.187 --> 01:07:50.810]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:50.810 --> 01:07:55.272]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:55.272 --> 01:08:03.156]  That's right, when I first had that intro, I don't know, 18 years ago, is when that intro was recorded.
[01:08:04.952 --> 01:08:08.454]  It was a little bit cheeky, a little bit of a joke, a little bit snarky.
[01:08:08.454 --> 01:08:11.056]  But now I am in FEMA Region 6, formerly Texas.
[01:08:11.056 --> 01:08:12.617]  We are under global government.
[01:08:12.617 --> 01:08:15.999]  The TPP has passed the House, set to pass the Senate.
[01:08:15.999 --> 01:08:24.624]  Liberals, conservatives across the board, from the unions to the Tea Party that have gotten the subsections through WikiLeaks say it's the end of sovereignty as we know it.
[01:08:24.624 --> 01:08:26.205]  It makes the President a dictator.
[01:08:26.205 --> 01:08:31.728]  It gives him unlimited power over trade, borders, taxes, guns, you name it.
[01:08:31.728 --> 01:08:33.409]  And it says in there they'll do this.
[01:08:35.663 --> 01:08:43.587]  So while we were all focused on the tragic shooting in South Carolina and Charleston, this was rammed through yesterday.
[01:08:43.587 --> 01:08:47.469]  And while we were busy doing that, they were putting in internet kill switches.
[01:08:47.469 --> 01:08:54.613]  And the FCC was declaring power over the web and saying they're planning to tax it and regulate it and control free speech.
[01:08:54.613 --> 01:08:57.774]  There is a move towards totalitarianism everywhere.
[01:08:57.774 --> 01:09:04.698]  The Prime Minister of England came out a month ago and said, we're not going to put up with people's free speech anymore, in a chilling statement.
[01:09:06.434 --> 01:09:14.899]  Corruption and tyranny is accelerating because the globalists are taking over and they've committed so many crimes, it's all or nothing.
[01:09:14.899 --> 01:09:16.580]  They're going for broke.
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:23.504]  I've known Jesse Ventura for about eight, nine years, and I've been part of three seasons or two seasons of his hit TV show.
[01:09:23.504 --> 01:09:28.047]  I've gotten to know him pretty well, traveled around the country with him, friends with his son as well.
[01:09:28.047 --> 01:09:28.908]  And he's the real deal.
[01:09:28.908 --> 01:09:32.230]  He's a real guy who doesn't compromise.
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:43.699]  And even though I disagree with him probably on 10-15% of his political views, I admire him because he sticks to his guns and he'll be the same today as he was a year ago as he'll be in five years.
[01:09:43.699 --> 01:09:44.801]  He doesn't waffle.
[01:09:45.575 --> 01:09:46.696]  And that's why he's demonized.
[01:09:46.696 --> 01:09:50.718]  It's why they ran the hit piece with the late Chris Kyle.
[01:09:50.718 --> 01:09:52.500]  Rest in peace.
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:58.604]  The family's now made, well, the overall book and film have made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:09:58.604 --> 01:10:05.508]  And the book was a fiction when it came to the Jesse Ventura part, and a jury found that it was defamation.
[01:10:05.508 --> 01:10:08.730]  Found that it was a fraud.
[01:10:08.730 --> 01:10:09.771]  That's very hard to do.
[01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:12.371]  Especially when you're a public figure.
[01:10:12.371 --> 01:10:17.956]  But it was done with the intent of making money off defaming Ventura.
[01:10:17.956 --> 01:10:21.600]  It rose above that level.
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:26.044]  There's now been a demonization campaign of Ventura, obviously because they don't want him running in 2016.
[01:10:26.044 --> 01:10:29.747]  They know a third party candidate could really galvanize the people.
[01:10:29.747 --> 01:10:30.528]  They're scared of that.
[01:10:31.912 --> 01:10:33.614]  And so they're assassinating him.
[01:10:33.614 --> 01:10:38.538]  Just like they're assassinating Rand Paul and Ron Paul and others right now with demonization campaigns.
[01:10:38.538 --> 01:10:41.160]  But he called me yesterday and we're honored he's breaking this news here.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:46.125]  He's got one of the top lawyers in the country.
[01:10:46.125 --> 01:10:51.569]  And, you know, who's beat Vince McMahon, you name it.
[01:10:51.569 --> 01:10:57.675]  And he broke down some info that is so over the top and affects every American.
[01:10:59.091 --> 01:11:00.032]  Unprecedented.
[01:11:00.032 --> 01:11:16.020]  I'm gonna let him tell you what's happened, but 50 top media outlets have all lined up with their money and their power to crush Jesse Ventura and everybody else's free speech and everybody else's right to a trial and defend themselves.
[01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:22.544]  They want, simply put, the right from the courts to lie and destroy people.
[01:11:22.544 --> 01:11:26.967]  And remember MSNBC, my lawyer said I could win last year, but he said it would cost millions.
[01:11:26.967 --> 01:11:27.547]  Millions I don't have.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.001]  He said, you can win.
[01:11:32.001 --> 01:11:39.865]  MSNBC said the bombers were influenced by Alex Jones and that Alex Jones is deeply racist and showed no proof.
[01:11:39.865 --> 01:11:46.409]  A jury would probably award me that, but I just want my name.
[01:11:46.409 --> 01:11:48.430]  But see, I can't file on every front.
[01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:56.534]  That's why I admire the fact that Ventura has spent incredible amounts of money, even though he was a well-to-do person, he spent a lot of it, is gone now, to get his name back.
[01:11:57.978 --> 01:11:59.018]  I mean, I can't give you the numbers.
[01:11:59.018 --> 01:12:03.379]  If he wants to do those, he can, but I happen to know that he didn't make any money on this.
[01:12:03.379 --> 01:12:10.041]  But he did the right thing, and now they're scared, they're lined up, and this affects everybody.
[01:12:10.041 --> 01:12:19.423]  Former Minnesota governor, TV star, movie star, best-selling author, former mayor, Jesse Ventura joins us back in the United States, in Minnesota.
[01:12:19.423 --> 01:12:20.864]  He also hosts Off the Grid TV.
[01:12:22.341 --> 01:12:25.563]  On Aura Television, very popular.
[01:12:25.563 --> 01:12:29.124]  Governor, I tell you, when you broke this down to me yesterday, it was staggering.
[01:12:29.124 --> 01:12:30.845]  You've learned more today.
[01:12:30.845 --> 01:12:33.026]  This is a big deal.
[01:12:33.026 --> 01:12:34.727]  Tell us exactly what's happened.
[01:12:34.727 --> 01:12:37.749]  Well, what's happened is this, Alex.
[01:12:37.749 --> 01:12:39.009]  I won the trial.
[01:12:39.009 --> 01:12:40.470]  It was in front of a jury.
[01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:43.392]  The jury found for me for defamation.
[01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:51.916]  Then there was a second count for unjust enrichment because of that defamation, that they used the defamation to enrich themselves.
[01:12:52.722 --> 01:12:53.764]  Yeah, I'm good.
[01:13:10.698 --> 01:13:32.514]  Leave to file brief, whatever it is, A-M-I-C-I-C-U-R-I-A-E, now that's legal jargon, of 33 media companies and organizations in support of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, 8th Circuit District, urging a reversal of this decision.
[01:13:33.266 --> 01:13:42.252]  Now, in layman's terms, what this means, they want the ability to be able to write lies about anybody.
[01:13:42.252 --> 01:13:50.918]  Now, it just happens I'm a pretty big public figure, and so many people out there are going to think, well, this will never affect me.
[01:13:50.918 --> 01:13:53.620]  I'm not a public figure like Jesse Ventura.
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:55.521]  No media is ever going to lie about me.
[01:13:57.006 --> 01:14:07.392]  That may be true, but it's still, this is a mega thing to our freedom and to protecting ourselves from the corporate fascist takeover that we're seeing.
[01:14:07.392 --> 01:14:16.938]  And what they want, if this is overturned, they will then have the ability to lie about you and make profit from those lies.
[01:14:16.938 --> 01:14:22.621]  And you will have no way to redress or no way to be compensated for the damage they do to you.
[01:14:23.301 --> 01:14:25.682]  So it's going to give them free reign.
[01:14:25.682 --> 01:14:27.622]  It's going to set the bar so high.
[01:14:27.622 --> 01:14:29.623]  The bar is already high.
[01:14:29.623 --> 01:14:39.465]  But it's going to set the bar so high that they will be able to lie and get away with it and there'll be nothing any individual out there can do.
[01:14:39.465 --> 01:14:42.166]  I fought this fight now by myself.
[01:14:42.166 --> 01:14:46.507]  It's three and a half years now, Alex, and it's drained me financially.
[01:14:47.359 --> 01:14:51.320]  And my attorney said this could end up in the Supreme Court.
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:56.942]  Because we do have the Supreme Court decision back in 1960 backing us.
[01:14:56.942 --> 01:15:06.005]  So if the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals rules for them, they will actually be going against a Supreme Court decision already on the books.
[01:15:06.872 --> 01:15:10.195]  So this could go all the way to the High Court.
[01:15:10.195 --> 01:15:18.622]  I'm urging people, I've never did this before really Alex, I guess I did when I ran for Governor and Mayor asking for votes.
[01:15:18.622 --> 01:15:23.607]  And this is hard for me to do being a person like I am, but I've got to ask for help on this.
[01:15:23.607 --> 01:15:27.290]  I need help to fight this fight.
[01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:33.536]  Because it's a 33, I mean, it's a who's who Alex, let me go down the list, should I?
[01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:35.390]  Absolutely.
[01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:37.631]  Last night we talked and you hadn't even seen the document yet.
[01:15:37.631 --> 01:15:38.971]  Just your lawyer said it was scores.
[01:15:38.971 --> 01:15:41.532]  Let me provide you a list of who it is.
[01:15:41.532 --> 01:15:44.613]  Before we do that, Governor, let me just explain to folks to be clear here.
[01:15:44.613 --> 01:15:49.994]  The major media, from the New York Times to Fox News, who are signed on to this, you're going to go over the list.
[01:15:49.994 --> 01:15:52.135]  They are saying they want immunity
[01:15:52.995 --> 01:16:00.165]  To be able to lie, just like vaccine makers want immunity, this is a license to steal, basically, people's identities.
[01:16:00.165 --> 01:16:08.037]  It's a license to say, I'm a bomber, or Alex Jones is a child molester, or Joe Smith's a bank robber, when we're not.
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:16.503]  And it makes it available that they can make profit from making those statements.
[01:16:16.503 --> 01:16:19.304]  That they will incur a great profit.
[01:16:19.304 --> 01:16:26.827]  And what they're trying to do is stop you from being able to stop them from making a profit from the lies.
[01:16:26.827 --> 01:16:28.828]  It's unprecedented, it is.
[01:16:28.828 --> 01:16:29.748]  Oh yes, it is.
[01:16:29.748 --> 01:16:31.029]  This is unprecedented.
[01:16:31.496 --> 01:16:40.702]  This is big, so please break down what your top lawyer told you, the angles of this, and who's signing on to... Well, I got the list right here.
[01:16:40.702 --> 01:16:42.943]  You got A&E Television Networks.
[01:16:42.943 --> 01:16:45.545]  We all know them from cable, A&E.
[01:16:45.545 --> 01:16:47.866]  Advanced Publication, Inc.
[01:16:47.866 --> 01:16:50.448]  American Society of News Editors.

[01:17:05.221 --> 01:17:24.393]  Scripps Company, First Amendment Coalition, Forbes Media, LLC, Gannett Company, Inc., Docker Media, Hatchet Book Group, Inc., the Hearst Corporation, Landmark Media Enterprises, the Media Law Resource Center, the Minnesota Newspaper Association,
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:30.544]  Uh, so even my own state of Minnesota stabs their governor in the back on this one.
[01:17:30.544 --> 01:17:33.726]  It shouldn't surprise me they did it while I was governor, too.
[01:17:33.726 --> 01:17:35.987]  Minnesota Newspaper Association.
[01:17:35.987 --> 01:17:39.049]  Motion Picture Association of America.

[01:17:51.457 --> 01:17:53.518]  They are so scared of you because you took on
[01:18:17.103 --> 01:18:23.688]  Goliath, you beat them, and now they're all piling in because they all tell so many lies now.
[01:18:23.688 --> 01:18:26.090]  Their executives have told them, go ahead and lie.
[01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:28.592]  They wouldn't lie as much as four or five years ago.
[01:18:28.592 --> 01:18:41.843]  I mean, they say outrageous lies about you and I and others constantly, and I guess they're scared we're going to start suing them, so they want the court to say they're allowed to enrich themselves off lying about people.
[01:18:41.843 --> 01:18:42.624]  That is incredible.
[01:18:42.944 --> 01:18:55.230]  Yeah, that's what they're asking the court to do, because they're putting it in light that this is an alternative for punitive damages, and of course you can't get punitive damage against an estate.
[01:18:55.230 --> 01:19:03.595]  I wonder if they'll... I'm surprised Brian Williams isn't a signatory to this.
[01:19:03.595 --> 01:19:11.119]  Anyway though, getting back to it Alex, I never dreamed that this would explode to the level that it has.
[01:19:12.529 --> 01:19:20.172]  That the entire, this is a who's who of the entire mainstream media of the United States of America.
[01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:20.752]  I know it is.
[01:19:20.752 --> 01:19:28.635]  Former Governor Jesse Ventura, who stood up, fought the hard fight, was told it's really going to be hard to win, still did it, because he was lied about.
[01:19:28.635 --> 01:19:30.276]  He was defamed.
[01:19:30.276 --> 01:19:39.019]  They said he was there happy that vets were dead when he'd been at their commencement, and he just stood up against it, and he won, and he used the American system to do it.
[01:19:39.019 --> 01:19:40.700]  They're trying to overthrow our system right now.
[01:19:42.609 --> 01:19:44.170]  We've all heard the news stories.
[01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:45.291]  Another shooting.
[01:19:45.291 --> 01:19:46.992]  And they're getting worse.

[01:21:11.056 --> 01:21:12.296]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:12.296 --> 01:21:16.798]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:21:16.798 --> 01:21:22.480]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:26.041]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:28.762]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:28.762 --> 01:21:33.764]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:21:33.764 --> 01:21:34.004]  Call 800-686-2237.

[01:21:40.566 --> 01:21:44.789]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:21:44.789 --> 01:21:45.409]  It's true.
[01:21:45.409 --> 01:21:49.572]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:21:49.572 --> 01:21:51.953]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.

[01:22:40.294 --> 01:22:42.236]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:22:42.236 --> 01:22:45.859]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:22:45.859 --> 01:22:47.220]  A pair of scissors.
[01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:53.005]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[01:22:53.005 --> 01:22:57.929]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[01:22:57.929 --> 01:22:58.910]  The phone line.
[01:22:58.910 --> 01:23:04.175]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:23:04.175 --> 01:23:07.918]  But, a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:23:08.078 --> 01:23:11.382]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.

[01:23:45.242 --> 01:23:47.763]  They don't want to see us
[01:23:55.242 --> 01:24:00.827]  I'm going to tweet at real Alex Jones here in a moment while Governor Ventura is speaking.
[01:24:00.827 --> 01:24:11.055]  Basically, that the New York Times is asking a federal court to certify that they're allowed to lie.
[01:24:11.055 --> 01:24:18.661]  The New York Times and others are going to court asking the government to protect them and let them lie.
[01:24:18.661 --> 01:24:20.062]  That's where this country's going.
[01:24:21.581 --> 01:24:23.763]  They want to be able to do this.
[01:24:23.763 --> 01:24:32.311]  Already defamation liable, if you're a public figure especially, is just stratospherically hard to prove.
[01:24:32.311 --> 01:24:33.692]  This is a short six minute segment.
[01:24:33.692 --> 01:24:37.396]  Governor Ventura, I've never heard him really open it up.
[01:24:37.396 --> 01:24:40.379]  During the breaks I'm talking to him about this because he's brainstorming right now.
[01:24:40.379 --> 01:24:45.584]  He just had the idea for a defense fund today because he has expended most of his money, even though he would have done well.
[01:24:46.889 --> 01:24:48.611]  Three and a half years fighting these guys.
[01:24:48.611 --> 01:24:51.914]  He told me off-air all they wanted in discovery.
[01:24:51.914 --> 01:24:53.856]  They're trying to break him right now.
[01:24:53.856 --> 01:24:57.640]  And if they do this, they're going to turn the heat up lying even more.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:59.402]  This affects everybody.
[01:24:59.402 --> 01:25:00.563]  Just like TPP.
[01:25:00.563 --> 01:25:02.285]  Just like the gun grab.
[01:25:02.285 --> 01:25:04.387]  We hang together or we hang separate.
[01:25:04.387 --> 01:25:06.089]  Governor, you were brainstorming a moment ago.
[01:25:06.089 --> 01:25:08.432]  Please share with the audience what you were sharing with me.
[01:25:08.432 --> 01:25:09.433]  I mean, I know it's hard for you to
[01:25:10.723 --> 01:25:15.525]  I mean, you're not a proud man, but you're also, I mean, you're a humble man, but you're a private man.
[01:25:15.525 --> 01:25:18.067]  But go ahead, share with people what you've been through.
[01:25:18.067 --> 01:25:30.473]  Well, you know, when I went through the trial with Vince McMahon and the WWF or WWE as they are now, the appeal, when I won, the appeal happened and was finished in like three to four months.
[01:25:30.473 --> 01:25:33.915]  And so I inquired to my attorney, why has it been a year?
[01:25:34.693 --> 01:25:37.554]  You know, I got the verdict last July-August.
[01:25:37.554 --> 01:25:42.876]  Why has it taken a whole year and the Court of Appeals hasn't even seen it yet?
[01:25:42.876 --> 01:25:51.418]  Well, apparently they filed three extensions, the other side, drew that out, and in the summer I learned the Court of Appeals doesn't work.
[01:25:51.418 --> 01:25:52.719]  They're off.
[01:25:52.719 --> 01:25:56.060]  So as soon as they pushed it off all the way till this fall.
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:26:01.882]  Well, that's a way, what they're doing, they're drawing it out, and the whole process, they've done this from day one.
[01:26:02.461 --> 01:26:03.242]  We're good to go.
[01:26:24.016 --> 01:26:35.522]  When I finally got a job, it's a job with a foreign employer, and my income has dropped substantially, and so it's been basically almost three to three and a half years of unemployment.
[01:26:39.402 --> 01:26:41.543]  That was their plan to destroy you.
[01:26:41.543 --> 01:26:45.765]  People always say we want champions, we want men that will stand up against the enemy.
[01:26:45.765 --> 01:26:47.305]  We want people to take action.
[01:26:47.305 --> 01:26:48.526]  You're doing it.
[01:26:48.526 --> 01:26:52.627]  You haven't set up a PO Box or a defense fund yet, but I wouldn't wait.
[01:26:52.627 --> 01:26:53.388]  Give us an address.
[01:26:54.341 --> 01:27:01.403]  I'm going to write a check because, you know, you told me privately that, you know, over the years and not having a job, that you're running out of money.
[01:27:01.403 --> 01:27:03.143]  That'll make them really happy.
[01:27:03.143 --> 01:27:04.583]  I'm not going to let them win.
[01:27:04.583 --> 01:27:05.423]  You took action.
[01:27:05.423 --> 01:27:06.604]  You've beaten them.
[01:27:06.604 --> 01:27:10.285]  That was one shot out of a thousand, but you had justice on your side.
[01:27:10.285 --> 01:27:12.505]  We've got to stand with you, Governor Ventura.
[01:27:12.505 --> 01:27:13.285]  This is important.
[01:27:13.285 --> 01:27:15.306]  I don't want you to give up, and I know you.
[01:27:15.306 --> 01:27:16.426]  You're not going to give up.
[01:27:16.826 --> 01:27:25.771]  Well, even worse than that, Bill O'Reilly brought on pundits and tried to call them legal experts, where all they did was ridicule the judge's decision, the jury's decision.
[01:27:39.582 --> 01:27:46.385]  And they said how wrong this was, and not one of them had sat in the courtroom and saw one speck of evidence.
[01:27:46.385 --> 01:27:47.745]  They were pundits.
[01:27:47.745 --> 01:27:49.086]  They weren't experts.
[01:27:49.086 --> 01:27:57.569]  But it's asinine to say you would go to a Navy SEAL event... Our corporate power is owned by the same corporation as Fox News.
[01:27:57.569 --> 01:28:04.632]  It's just crazy that they told Kyle, I guess, that he could get away with this, and obviously he didn't get away with it.
[01:28:06.084 --> 01:28:06.544]  I don't know.
[01:28:06.544 --> 01:28:11.928]  I don't know that aspect of it that much, but, you know, unfortunately he's dead and gone.
[01:28:11.928 --> 01:28:18.251]  I wish you were alive because I would have loved to have gotten him on the stand during the trial, but we didn't have that available.
[01:28:18.251 --> 01:28:20.373]  Wasn't that convenient?
[01:28:20.373 --> 01:28:20.953]  What's that?
[01:28:20.953 --> 01:28:22.434]  Wasn't it convenient he died?
[01:28:22.434 --> 01:28:23.515]  Very sad.
[01:28:23.515 --> 01:28:25.356]  Well, I don't know nothing about that.
[01:28:25.356 --> 01:28:27.017]  That happened down in Texas.
[01:28:27.017 --> 01:28:28.858]  You'd know more about that than I would, Alex.
[01:28:30.567 --> 01:28:31.248]  Uh, yeah, no.
[01:28:31.248 --> 01:28:37.654]  I mean, he was a big propaganda front for them, like Pat Tillman, and when he started going sideways, they had to make him a dead hero.
[01:28:37.654 --> 01:28:40.737]  It was the only way to save their myth.
[01:28:40.737 --> 01:28:54.791]  But, uh, any of that, but the thing getting back on track here is that people don't realize what they're doing here, these conglomerate corporations, the enemy, for lack of a better term, that you and I are fighting against,
[01:28:55.774 --> 01:29:06.500]  They want the government to rubber stamp that they can lie, and if they profit from those lies, they don't have to give up any money or profit because of those lies.
[01:29:08.769 --> 01:29:16.773]  It shows that they've become completely morally bankrupt at the top and are consciously trying to forge a criminal society.
[01:29:16.773 --> 01:29:19.134]  I want to get more into this when we come back.
[01:29:19.134 --> 01:29:22.135]  The overall move to attack free speech worldwide.
[01:29:22.135 --> 01:29:28.298]  I want to get into the shootings with you and different things that are unfolding with Jesse Ventura.
[01:29:28.298 --> 01:29:30.699]  I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com.
[01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:32.080]  We're on the march.
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:34.601]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:34.601 --> 01:29:37.262]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:41.616 --> 01:29:48.625]  The Pope has written an encyclical calling for a global political authority with power to save the environment.
[01:29:48.625 --> 01:29:54.331]  A Pope once came after Galileo for pointing out that the sun was the center of our solar system.
[01:29:54.331 --> 01:29:59.518]  Today, those who point out that the sun is a dominant factor in climate are vilified.
[01:30:00.098 --> 01:30:05.541]  The dogma of man-made global warming has been more of a religion than a science for a long time.
[01:30:05.541 --> 01:30:12.644]  James Lovelock, father of the Gaia hypothesis, pointedly said that environmentalism has, quote, become a religion, unquote.
[01:30:12.644 --> 01:30:20.648]  The outgoing head of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said climate change is, quote, my religion and dharma, unquote.
[01:30:21.068 --> 01:30:24.210]  The religion of environmentalism even has its own indulgences.
[01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:28.432]  You can pay for your sins against the environment with carbon credits.
[01:30:28.432 --> 01:30:33.655]  It was the abuse of indulgences by a former Pope that led to the Protestant Reformation.
[01:30:33.655 --> 01:30:38.698]  Today, we need a political and scientific reformation of the Church of Climatology.
[01:30:38.698 --> 01:30:40.579]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:30:41.219 --> 01:30:47.341]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[01:30:47.341 --> 01:30:51.922]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[01:30:51.922 --> 01:30:59.624]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[01:30:59.884 --> 01:31:05.390]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:11.337]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[01:31:11.337 --> 01:31:16.302]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[01:31:16.302 --> 01:31:19.886]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[01:31:20.226 --> 01:31:26.849]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[01:31:26.849 --> 01:31:31.991]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[01:31:31.991 --> 01:31:35.252]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:35.252 --> 01:31:37.613]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:31:40.908 --> 01:31:57.553]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[01:31:57.553 --> 01:32:01.054]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[01:32:01.414 --> 01:32:05.459]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:32:05.459 --> 01:32:07.001]  Hdfirearms.com.
[01:32:07.001 --> 01:32:10.324]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs and Special Ops people.
[01:32:10.324 --> 01:32:15.450]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[01:32:15.450 --> 01:32:16.271]  It's always about security.
[01:32:16.271 --> 01:32:16.651]  I think so.
[01:32:51.607 --> 01:32:55.669]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:57.709]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:32:57.709 --> 01:33:06.333]  And that's a Thomas Jefferson quote.
[01:33:06.333 --> 01:33:11.695]  Bottom line, the God of the New World Order is lies and fraud and deceit.
[01:33:11.695 --> 01:33:12.875]  And dominating others.
[01:33:12.875 --> 01:33:15.436]  And they want all of it certified and protected.
[01:33:15.436 --> 01:33:19.218]  So you have no way to ever bring them to justice.
[01:33:20.239 --> 01:33:40.827]  During the break, Jesse Ventura was talking about the fact that, hey, I'm taking on 33 Goliaths that have signed on with their hundreds of subsidiaries to an amicus brief to the court, and that means money, support, everything to try to crush the jury decision.
[01:33:40.827 --> 01:33:42.388]  I wouldn't even call it an uphill fight.
[01:33:42.388 --> 01:33:42.908]  It's a battle.
[01:33:44.173 --> 01:33:45.854]  And he's gone this far.
[01:33:45.854 --> 01:33:48.316]  He hasn't even set up a kickstart campaign or a P.O.
[01:33:48.316 --> 01:33:49.337]  box yet.
[01:33:49.337 --> 01:33:50.718]  Sometime next week that'll be ready.
[01:33:50.718 --> 01:33:53.059]  Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[01:33:53.059 --> 01:33:57.983]  But this just fits the overall climate that we're in right now.
[01:33:59.173 --> 01:34:03.038]  Where just every basic freedom is being scrapped.
[01:34:03.038 --> 01:34:09.305]  Jesse, I want you to put a bookend on this and make any other comments on this subject and where this is going.
[01:34:09.305 --> 01:34:15.413]  And then I want to move into some other subjects and get your take on that, because I know listeners want to know your view on the tragic shooting up in...
[01:34:16.764 --> 01:34:19.007]  South Carolina on what's happening in the economy.
[01:34:19.007 --> 01:34:20.710]  A lot of really ominous signs.
[01:34:20.710 --> 01:34:29.563]  Things are coming to a head and classically people in the system, the enemy, are going to the tools of totalitarianism.
[01:34:30.526 --> 01:34:34.910]  They think to protect themselves, but I don't really think that's going to work too well.
[01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:44.179]  But, man, I tell you, the stuff we covered on your TV show, that first season on the FEMA camps and threat fusion centers, that really almost seems passe now.
[01:34:44.179 --> 01:34:51.005]  It was shocking at the time, but so much of this is out in the open, and I'm just stunned
[01:34:52.106 --> 01:34:54.270]  That they are moving this quickly.
[01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:55.652]  I mean, war with Russia?
[01:34:55.652 --> 01:34:55.952]  U.S.
[01:34:55.952 --> 01:35:01.901]  troops are now engaging in combat, not just training, against Russians in eastern Ukraine.
[01:35:04.059 --> 01:35:05.981]  Our government openly funded Al-Qaeda.
[01:35:05.981 --> 01:35:07.182]  It's come out in the news.
[01:35:07.182 --> 01:35:10.944]  The 28 pages has come out that Saudi Arabia was running 9-11.
[01:35:10.944 --> 01:35:12.025]  Our government stood down.
[01:35:12.025 --> 01:35:13.005]  We're vindicated there.
[01:35:13.005 --> 01:35:14.967]  I don't want to be vindicated.
[01:35:14.967 --> 01:35:16.147]  I just want it all to stop.
[01:35:16.147 --> 01:35:20.650]  I mean, I can't believe they're more criminal than we even thought is my view.
[01:35:20.650 --> 01:35:21.791]  I'm kind of ranting here.
[01:35:21.791 --> 01:35:24.273]  It's just, I've never been pollaxed.
[01:35:24.273 --> 01:35:27.695]  I'm getting to the point where I'm just, my mouth is hanging open, Governor.
[01:35:28.573 --> 01:35:50.544]  Well, you know, we did conspiracy theory and everybody thought, oh, look at this crazy show, you know, a former governor's doing this, this is, and you know, they have the stereotypical, oh, he's a conspiracy theorist, which means you're nuts, when the reality is they did a study in Europe and found that conspiracy theorists are generally more intelligent than the average people.
[01:35:51.184 --> 01:35:51.765]  That's right.
[01:36:09.861 --> 01:36:29.656]  And now it's just astounding watching all this stuff, the FEMA camps, all this stuff that we talked about, the strange weather when we went up and investigated HAARP, and all this stuff, and it's just like, oh my God, you know, no wonder they wanted that show off the air.
[01:36:29.656 --> 01:36:37.442]  It's a bunch of mad scientists with unlimited funding playing God, and they just see our basic freedoms as in the way of them playing God.
[01:36:38.447 --> 01:36:42.169]  Pretty much, I'm starting to believe that myself.
[01:36:42.169 --> 01:36:50.133]  Like I said, it's just amazing to me that my case, which is really, it's not a national case.
[01:36:50.133 --> 01:37:00.398]  An individual defamed me in a book and I was forced to defend myself from that defamation and they unjustly enriched themselves.
[01:37:00.398 --> 01:37:02.299]  How can this be a national issue?
[01:37:02.859 --> 01:37:08.704]  I was the guy that called you in Mexico and got you on the phone and told you, and you thought I was doing a dirty joke.
[01:37:08.704 --> 01:37:11.165]  I mean, you were like, come on, Alex.
[01:37:11.165 --> 01:37:15.148]  And I said, no, this is really being said all over the news right now.
[01:37:15.148 --> 01:37:15.869]  Yeah.
[01:37:15.869 --> 01:37:20.192]  But I mean, how could this be a national issue, which it is now?
[01:37:20.192 --> 01:37:28.359]  I mean, sure, it was important to Jesse Ventura, just as if someone defamed Burt Reynolds or defamed whoever else may be out there.
[01:37:28.359 --> 01:37:30.900]  You know, it's important to the individual and who they are.
[01:37:31.917 --> 01:37:40.579]  Now it's, this whole, my whole trial has burst into an entire national war to save our asses.
[01:37:40.579 --> 01:37:41.100]  That's it?
[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:44.781]  Well that's what happens when one man does the right thing and then wins.
[01:37:44.781 --> 01:37:53.023]  The enemy comes in again and they just keep doubling down because they know they're going to lose if they don't and they just hope in this game of chicken you and others back off.
[01:37:53.023 --> 01:37:55.083]  But they're scared to death.
[01:37:55.083 --> 01:38:00.425]  They know their house of cards is coming down and they know that people are waking up to them.
[01:38:01.232 --> 01:38:01.892]  I hope so.
[01:38:01.892 --> 01:38:05.935]  I really hope so, Alex.
[01:38:05.935 --> 01:38:11.678]  Like I said, it gets pretty lonely out there fighting the fight.
[01:38:11.678 --> 01:38:16.580]  It's been tough on my wife and tough on everybody.
[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:18.441]  I've lost friends.
[01:38:18.441 --> 01:38:23.224]  Well, I guess they weren't really friends if they won't stick with you, but you thought they were.
[01:38:24.377 --> 01:38:27.178]  Well, there's a lot of cowards and a lot of people that are fair weather friends.
[01:38:27.178 --> 01:38:29.418]  They're summertime soldiers.
[01:38:29.418 --> 01:38:31.338]  And they're the plague.
[01:38:31.338 --> 01:38:36.700]  But when things really get bad, people you didn't think were your friends will also start showing up.
[01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:37.440]  Oh, yeah.
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:38.500]  No doubt about it.
[01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:44.021]  Like I said, I hate to do this and we'll go on to the other subjects, but I may have to have help.
[01:38:44.021 --> 01:38:48.622]  And I want your... You've got loyal listeners, Alex, everywhere I go in the world.
[01:38:49.122 --> 01:38:55.328]  People come up to me and one of the first things they'll always say to me is I listen to Alex Jones It's like that.
[01:38:55.328 --> 01:38:57.450]  It's almost like handing me a business card
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:38:59.600]  Sure, it's Fight Club.
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:00.501]  It's Fight Club-esque.
[01:39:00.501 --> 01:39:02.802]  Expanding on that, I followed your case.
[01:39:02.802 --> 01:39:04.623]  I've been in the middle of it.
[01:39:04.623 --> 01:39:09.225]  You know, I debated Chris Collin, Opie, and Anthony right after this lie was put out.
[01:39:09.225 --> 01:39:11.527]  I warned them all, you know, you better watch it.
[01:39:11.527 --> 01:39:12.287]  This is serious.
[01:39:12.287 --> 01:39:13.087]  He's going to sue you.
[01:39:13.087 --> 01:39:14.208]  He didn't do it.
[01:39:14.208 --> 01:39:17.089]  You know, you're hurting somebody.
[01:39:17.089 --> 01:39:19.491]  But clearly it was a plan to destroy you.
[01:39:19.491 --> 01:39:21.292]  You didn't have a choice.
[01:39:21.292 --> 01:39:23.353]  They were coming to assassinate your name.
[01:39:24.133 --> 01:39:25.794]  That's what they do instead of killing you nowadays.
[01:39:25.794 --> 01:39:27.875]  They destroy your name.
[01:39:27.875 --> 01:39:30.176]  They take your credibility and they marginalize you.
[01:39:30.176 --> 01:39:35.179]  And so you didn't have a choice and now you told me privately, hey, I'm not wealthy like I used to be.
[01:39:35.179 --> 01:39:38.941]  I've blown almost all my money on this, but I can't stop.
[01:39:38.941 --> 01:39:45.065]  And you know, you were even privately telling me about having to sell your house or whatever to fight these people and just move to Mexico, I guess.
[01:39:45.065 --> 01:39:46.566]  I mean, it's just so sad.
[01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:50.810]  No, I don't think so Alex, because he originally told the story back in 06.
[01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:51.931]  He told it to his sailor buddies out there.
[01:40:14.890 --> 01:40:16.271]  So don't give him a pass.
[01:40:16.271 --> 01:40:17.392]  No, I understand.
[01:40:17.392 --> 01:40:20.395]  So it was a fish story.
[01:40:20.395 --> 01:40:24.438]  He whored the Trident, what we call whoring the Trident.
[01:40:24.438 --> 01:40:28.102]  We had a standard rule in the teams, much like Vegas.
[01:40:28.102 --> 01:40:30.764]  What happens on deployment stays on deployment.
[01:40:31.317 --> 01:40:33.819]  You don't come home and write books about it.
[01:40:33.819 --> 01:40:36.621]  Unfortunately, that's not the way it is today.
[01:40:36.621 --> 01:40:40.584]  Now they all come home and write books about it because they can get wealthy.
[01:40:40.584 --> 01:40:41.625]  Well, that's fine.
[01:40:41.625 --> 01:40:46.549]  I don't begrudge anyone anything, but it still goes against the old seal tradition of
[01:40:46.929 --> 01:40:48.310]  We don't talk about what we do.
[01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:48.670]  I don't know.
[01:40:48.670 --> 01:40:49.471]  Gosh, I don't know.
[01:40:49.471 --> 01:40:53.754]  Like I said, I've been out of them now for, you know, I left in 1973, but back then you didn't hoard the trike.
[01:41:12.418 --> 01:41:21.858]  And remember, Chris Kyle, and then he took an old-timer like me and threw me under the bus, knowing full well that that incident did not occur.
[01:41:23.138 --> 01:41:27.439]  And he did it for fame and fortune, so don't give him a pass.
[01:41:27.439 --> 01:41:28.480]  Well, no, I agree with you.
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:30.320]  It's very dishonorable.
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:38.503]  I was just... Clearly, though, he was being... People picked up on his line of bull and they got him hyped up to go all the way with it.
[01:41:38.503 --> 01:41:39.243]  Oh, yeah.
[01:41:39.243 --> 01:41:46.285]  Well, and especially after he unfortunately died, they thought I would... Well, here's the situation they put me in, Alex.
[01:41:46.285 --> 01:41:52.107]  Imagine for a moment if a veteran accused you of being a child molester and you sued that veteran.
[01:41:52.924 --> 01:41:56.808]  And then unfortunately, before it went to trial, the veteran died.
[01:41:56.808 --> 01:42:02.234]  Well, would you drop your lawsuit and be marked as a child molester for the rest of your life?
[01:42:02.234 --> 01:42:05.398]  Or would you continue the lawsuit to clear your name?
[01:42:05.398 --> 01:42:06.659]  Which is all that I did.
[01:42:11.618 --> 01:42:13.560]  No, you did what you had to do.
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:15.102]  You had no other recourse.
[01:42:15.102 --> 01:42:21.410]  Yeah, there was nothing else I could do or get out of public and go to Mexico and never show my face again.
[01:42:21.410 --> 01:42:23.172]  No, you didn't stick your tail between your legs.
[01:42:23.172 --> 01:42:23.693]  I admire you.
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:26.122]  You know, that was my alternative.
[01:42:26.122 --> 01:42:27.963]  And so I fought the fight.
[01:42:27.963 --> 01:42:31.147]  The only thing is, the fight has now gone globally.
[01:42:31.147 --> 01:42:32.968]  Not globally, but United States.
[01:42:32.968 --> 01:42:35.531]  Make no mistake, this is global because they follow U.S.
[01:42:35.531 --> 01:42:37.973]  jurisprudence.
[01:42:37.973 --> 01:42:44.059]  I would have said, I can't imagine the Supreme Court's going to overrule themselves and say you're allowed to lie knowingly and profit from it.
[01:42:44.059 --> 01:42:46.682]  But in this climate, they'll probably rule that way.
[01:42:47.202 --> 01:42:48.022]  I don't know.
[01:42:48.022 --> 01:42:48.903]  I don't know.
[01:42:48.903 --> 01:42:50.243]  And we'll have to wait and see.
[01:42:50.243 --> 01:42:52.244]  But like I said, Alex, I'll be back.
[01:42:52.244 --> 01:42:53.525]  I'll call you back next week.
[01:42:53.525 --> 01:42:58.847]  Hopefully I'll set up to where if people do want to help out this financially.
[01:42:58.847 --> 01:43:03.909]  I mean, I feel like I'm asking for charity, but I think that the fight is a good fight.
[01:43:03.909 --> 01:43:07.090]  It's one that we, the people, need to fight.
[01:43:07.090 --> 01:43:09.291]  We've got to fight this because if I get beat,
[01:43:10.288 --> 01:43:12.771]  It's going to have repercussions, not just on me.
[01:43:12.771 --> 01:43:14.873]  It's going to have them on you and everybody else.
[01:43:14.873 --> 01:43:17.516]  Well, I always said this was a national case.
[01:43:17.516 --> 01:43:19.438]  And you were like, no, it's just my personal case.
[01:43:19.438 --> 01:43:21.019]  And I'm not saying, see, I was right.
[01:43:21.019 --> 01:43:22.261]  This is key.
[01:43:22.261 --> 01:43:25.684]  They, with their actuaries, their computers and their political scientists.
[01:43:26.645 --> 01:43:26.965]  Well...
[01:43:54.358 --> 01:43:57.140]  They don't know us that well because we don't roll over.
[01:43:57.140 --> 01:44:00.442]  Anyway, Alex, what else you want to talk about?
[01:44:00.442 --> 01:44:01.923]  Well, I just want to say this.
[01:44:01.923 --> 01:44:04.044]  These are epic times we're living in.
[01:44:04.044 --> 01:44:16.531]  Obama came out and blamed the Second Amendment for the situation in South Carolina, but it turns out he was on an anti-psychotic medication that literally says it can make you kill people on the insert.
[01:44:16.531 --> 01:44:18.573]  You know what I find interesting, Alex?
[01:44:19.273 --> 01:44:32.096]  How come whenever it's a white guy doing the killing, he's always psychotic and on drugs or is mentally disturbed, and yet when it's black people, you never hear them say that, do ya?
[01:44:32.096 --> 01:44:34.877]  Well, I'm not defending when blacks or whites kill each other.
[01:44:34.877 --> 01:44:35.477]  I think it's horrible.
[01:44:35.477 --> 01:44:37.878]  I agree, but I just find it interesting.
[01:44:37.878 --> 01:44:40.738]  Obviously, the guy's a psychotic nut.
[01:44:40.738 --> 01:44:45.079]  Nobody in their right mind goes out and behaves in that manner.
[01:44:45.079 --> 01:44:46.660]  That's a given.
[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:47.400]  That's a given.
[01:44:48.135 --> 01:44:57.821]  Anybody that could walk in to a place of worship where there are peaceful, peace-loving people and walk in and just murder them?
[01:44:57.821 --> 01:44:59.342]  Well, you don't have to.
[01:44:59.342 --> 01:45:01.603]  In that case, you don't have to question.
[01:45:01.603 --> 01:45:04.145]  Of course that person is nuts.
[01:45:04.145 --> 01:45:06.306]  That's not normal behavior.
[01:45:06.306 --> 01:45:08.508]  No one in their right mind would ever say it was.
[01:45:10.796 --> 01:45:11.476]  Well, I agree.
[01:45:11.476 --> 01:45:16.798]  Most of the black-on-black crime is gang-related, drug war stuff.
[01:45:16.798 --> 01:45:22.680]  In the few cases we've seen a deranged black person go in and do similar stuff, they've always been on psychotropics.
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:27.761]  I mean, the insert says that these whole classes can make you do this.
[01:45:27.761 --> 01:45:34.083]  I don't know about that stuff, but we need to take the big... You can't blame the gun.
[01:45:34.083 --> 01:45:37.664]  You know, right away, blame the gun and we need new gun laws.
[01:45:38.354 --> 01:45:39.915]  No, that ain't it.
[01:45:39.915 --> 01:45:45.178]  I mean, I have a gun safe and never once have I come home and heard any misbehaving out of it.
[01:45:45.178 --> 01:45:46.218]  That's right.
[01:45:46.218 --> 01:45:49.200]  You know, it requires a human element.
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:54.803]  And if there's not a gun, well, what would be the difference if the guy would have thrown a hand grenade?
[01:45:54.803 --> 01:46:01.026]  Well, what if he'd have waited outside with his car till the main church on Sunday let out and ran over 100 people?
[01:46:01.026 --> 01:46:03.268]  Yeah, and ran them all over at 80 miles an hour.
[01:46:04.730 --> 01:46:12.823]  You know, the point is that we systematically like to blame the tool rather than get to the base of the problem.
[01:46:14.841 --> 01:46:28.492]  Well, I agree with you, but this is about coming after the guns, and this, what do you think of the Republican leadership, talk about how they're a gang, siding with Obama against the Democrats and the Tea Party, and ramming through the TPP.
[01:46:28.492 --> 01:46:36.358]  It's not completely rammed through, but they did pass it out of the House yesterday, when it's a secret treaty and gives the President dictatorial power.
[01:46:36.909 --> 01:46:38.750]  Not only that, this is the trade thing?
[01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:39.451]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:39.451 --> 01:46:46.515]  Yeah, not only that, no input from the people and the participation of over 600 corporations in it.
[01:46:46.515 --> 01:46:48.797]  What you have here is fascism.
[01:46:48.797 --> 01:47:02.325]  You have now, because the Supreme Court allowed the corporations to become people, you have corporations dictating policy with their money to the politicians, and now they're dictating policy completely.
[01:47:02.325 --> 01:47:03.346]  They're even brought in.
[01:47:04.139 --> 01:47:07.981]  They're brought in, and one of the things, you know what one of the things in this is?
[01:47:07.981 --> 01:47:14.404]  That the corporations can do business and it allows them to sue governments who don't cooperate with them.
[01:47:14.404 --> 01:47:15.804]  Exactly.
[01:47:15.804 --> 01:47:17.845]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:47:17.845 --> 01:47:31.111]  Here they want to take away my right to sue when they lie about me and profit from it, but here on this trade agreement, they then want the ability to sue governments who don't kowtow to their needs.
[01:47:33.311 --> 01:47:36.412]  It's a total power grab, and this is the same case.
[01:47:36.412 --> 01:47:37.632]  It's fascism.
[01:47:37.632 --> 01:47:38.132]  It is.
[01:47:38.132 --> 01:47:39.093]  It's corporate fascism.
[01:47:39.093 --> 01:47:48.755]  Look at how 33 conglomerates with thousands of subsidiaries under them, thousands, are coming against you with money and power, with that message, with the same thing.
[01:47:48.755 --> 01:48:00.138]  They're removing the Magna Carta, they're removing the Bill of Rights, they're removing any power we have to peacefully resist their hegemonic takeover.
[01:48:00.925 --> 01:48:07.634]  Well, you know, it's getting to the point, Alex, and I think, God, we're going to get flagged for this one.
[01:48:07.634 --> 01:48:10.478]  Maybe it's time for the rakes and the shovels and the torches.
[01:48:12.412 --> 01:48:13.352]  You get what I mean.
[01:48:13.352 --> 01:48:13.853]  Yes, sir.
[01:48:13.853 --> 01:48:21.215]  Well, that's why they're gearing up and admitting in the Army Times that they're preparing the military to take on the American people, but the military's really waking up.
[01:48:21.215 --> 01:48:27.197]  What's your view on these giant military drills that they admit are training to take over the United States?
[01:48:27.197 --> 01:48:28.438]  It's horrifying.
[01:48:28.438 --> 01:48:41.302]  It goes back to that defense bill a couple years ago that McCain and the guy from Michigan ramrodded through that amendment to the offense bill, defense bill that allows the military to operate within the United States on the war on terror.
[01:48:41.882 --> 01:48:42.262]  That's right.
[01:48:42.262 --> 01:48:48.766]  And what did the John Moore Defense Authorization Act say in 97?
[01:48:48.766 --> 01:48:49.926]  In 2007.
[01:48:49.926 --> 01:48:56.590]  It said that NORTHCOM is to stop insurrection in the states or by the states.
[01:48:56.590 --> 01:48:59.271]  It admits that it's to suppress the states.
[01:48:59.271 --> 01:49:00.291]  Yeah.
[01:49:00.291 --> 01:49:06.094]  So, you know, and you've got police forces out there now that they don't look like the police anymore.
[01:49:06.094 --> 01:49:11.097]  When I was a kid growing up, the police walked around with a little hat on and a blue shirt
[01:49:11.866 --> 01:49:17.091]  These kind of dark blue slacks and they got white cars that said protect and serve.
[01:49:17.091 --> 01:49:20.413]  Now the police come out with helmet gear on.
[01:49:20.413 --> 01:49:27.559]  They come out looking like they're heading to Beirut, Lebanon or Iraq for a full-scale war.
[01:49:27.559 --> 01:49:31.143]  And those are now our police?
[01:49:31.143 --> 01:49:32.604]  And then I love this one.
[01:49:32.604 --> 01:49:36.447]  I want to bring this point up, Alex, that ties together a little bit.
[01:49:36.447 --> 01:49:37.428]  I know it's a little off, but
[01:49:38.209 --> 01:49:42.653]  In war, you're not allowed to use chemical weapons according to the rules of war.
[01:49:42.653 --> 01:49:46.337]  You should not use chemical weapons against your opponent, right?
[01:49:46.337 --> 01:49:51.361]  That was one of the big excuses they had for us to invade Iraq, was that Saddam did that.
[01:49:51.361 --> 01:49:53.003]  It was outrageous.
[01:49:53.003 --> 01:49:59.729]  So we can't use chemicals against an enemy, but we're allowed to use chemicals against our own people?
[01:50:02.145 --> 01:50:03.246]  You're absolutely right.
[01:50:03.246 --> 01:50:07.868]  When we come back, I want to get into the preparations for an economic collapse.
[01:50:07.868 --> 01:50:09.689]  Europe is already in free fall.
[01:50:09.689 --> 01:50:11.990]  There's already bank runs beginning.
[01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:15.952]  Ron Paul says that any minute the stock market could implode.
[01:50:15.952 --> 01:50:17.712]  Here's the headline, CNBC.
[01:50:17.712 --> 01:50:19.633]  Stock market day of reckoning is near.
[01:50:19.633 --> 01:50:26.897]  I want to get former Minnesota governor's take on the state of the world, the economy, and why he thinks all these billionaires are fleeing to armored redoubts.
[01:50:27.737 --> 01:50:36.564]  In different areas of the United States and in New Zealand, Jesse Ventura, under establishment attack, is our guest.
[01:50:36.564 --> 01:50:38.966]  And he's got the courage to continue to fight.
[01:50:38.966 --> 01:50:39.747]  We need to support him.
[01:50:39.747 --> 01:50:40.167]  We'll be back.
[01:50:57.020 --> 01:50:59.362]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.

[01:52:40.517 --> 01:52:43.420]  It's absolutely heartbreaking.

[01:53:49.984 --> 01:53:50.665]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:53:51.844 --> 01:53:56.047]  And I've been demonized, I've been attacked a lot, I expect that doing this.
[01:53:56.047 --> 01:53:59.709]  I don't want to be a slave.
[01:53:59.709 --> 01:54:03.352]  But, I would expect that others that believe in freedom would support me.
[01:54:03.352 --> 01:54:04.833]  And you've done that.
[01:54:04.833 --> 01:54:06.674]  With all that you've done.
[01:54:06.674 --> 01:54:11.798]  We try to sell high quality water filters to cut out the glyphosates and all the rest of it, and the fluoride.
[01:54:11.798 --> 01:54:18.062]  High quality non-GMO seeds at great prices, shortwave radios, liberty based apparel, pro-gun apparel.

[01:54:32.998 --> 01:54:37.783]  We are selling out rapidly of survival shield, nascent iodine, X2, that so many people are...
[01:54:38.689 --> 01:54:40.010]  Deficienin.
[01:54:40.010 --> 01:54:41.892]  That's the whole halogen conspiracy.
[01:54:41.892 --> 01:54:44.014]  Watch the video at Infowarslife.com.
[01:54:44.014 --> 01:54:48.438]  We have the liver shield that opens up your liver and detoxes it with concentrated known herbs.
[01:54:48.438 --> 01:54:50.179]  We have the advanced liver cleanse.
[01:54:50.179 --> 01:54:54.363]  You can see instructional videos about that at Infowarslife.com.
[01:54:54.363 --> 01:55:03.250]  And your purchase of all these products funds this organization that is one of the only truly independent, nonpartisan, libertarian-based
[01:55:04.051 --> 01:55:11.356]  Americana organizations in the world and we're a platform to promote and defend everybody else that's fighting for freedom.
[01:55:11.356 --> 01:55:14.378]  And who is decent and honorable and who will stand up.
[01:55:15.242 --> 01:55:18.966]  And believe me, it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better, folks.
[01:55:18.966 --> 01:55:23.911]  I've been told by high-level people years ago that your show's going to explode because what you're saying is dead on.
[01:55:23.911 --> 01:55:24.792]  Get ready.
[01:55:24.792 --> 01:55:26.133]  It's going to be bad.
[01:55:26.133 --> 01:55:27.735]  And the elites are running for the hills.
[01:55:27.735 --> 01:55:30.177]  Jesse Ventura's with us five minutes into the next hour.
[01:55:30.177 --> 01:55:31.078]  We appreciate his time.
[01:55:31.078 --> 01:55:36.503]  He'll be back with us next week, hopefully, to launch that fundraiser, not for him, but for all of us.
[01:55:37.504 --> 01:55:42.008]  Now that he has 33 companies lined up against him doing this.
[01:55:42.008 --> 01:55:49.694]  But getting into the elites, it's been a London Guardian, New York Times, running to New Zealand, buying safe houses, buying armored redoubts.
[01:55:49.694 --> 01:55:54.518]  You did a TV show on the facility up in the Ozarks.
[01:55:54.518 --> 01:55:55.759]  What are they gearing up for?
[01:55:55.759 --> 01:56:02.245]  Ron Paul talking about stock market day of reckoning coming, banker bailouts in Europe.
[01:56:02.245 --> 01:56:03.546]  Where is all this going, Governor?
[01:56:04.511 --> 01:56:11.608]  You know, it's mind-blowing, Alex, because there's also the rumor, get away from the coast and get to the high ground.
[01:56:12.734 --> 01:56:18.719]  You know, I've heard that one now, that ultimately Denver could become the capital of America.
[01:56:18.719 --> 01:56:19.960]  I don't know.
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:23.342]  It is the alternate capital under COG, you're correct.
[01:56:23.342 --> 01:56:25.044]  It's already the alternate capital.
[01:56:25.044 --> 01:56:27.806]  Yeah, and so what are they telling us?
[01:56:27.806 --> 01:56:34.571]  Something's going to happen down at the ocean level that is going to devastate and destroy everything there?
[01:56:34.571 --> 01:56:37.253]  And the only way to survive is to be up in the high country?
[01:56:37.253 --> 01:56:37.974]  I don't know.
[01:56:37.974 --> 01:56:40.596]  They are acting like they don't care about anything anymore.
[01:56:42.385 --> 01:56:44.606]  It's interesting.
[01:56:44.606 --> 01:56:47.847]  It'll keep you thinking and wake you up.
[01:56:47.847 --> 01:57:00.811]  I have to beg off a little, Alex, because I've been so entrenched in my own mess with this that it's very difficult for me to focus on the otherworldly stuff right now and what's going on, so I apologize for that.
[01:57:00.811 --> 01:57:01.711]  Well, I'm going to say this, then.
[01:57:01.711 --> 01:57:02.892]  I'm going to interrupt.
[01:57:02.892 --> 01:57:06.893]  If Ron Paul is scared, there's reason to be afraid.
[01:57:06.893 --> 01:57:08.854]  If Ron Paul is scared, there's reason to be afraid.
[01:57:08.854 --> 01:57:09.354]  I'll say this.
[01:57:10.194 --> 01:57:11.575]  They've tried to destroy your name.
[01:57:11.575 --> 01:57:13.397]  They haven't succeeded completely.
[01:57:13.397 --> 01:57:14.878]  You've gotten a lot of it back, clearly.
[01:57:14.878 --> 01:57:19.562]  You've won with the jury, even if they overturn it, which we should fight.
[01:57:19.562 --> 01:57:21.163]  You still won with the people.
[01:57:21.163 --> 01:57:22.945]  They just engaged in fraud.
[01:57:22.945 --> 01:57:26.868]  But they're trying to keep you diverted so you don't run for president.
[01:57:26.868 --> 01:57:29.651]  I think the way you really get at them is do what they're afraid of.
[01:57:30.523 --> 01:57:37.087]  Well, okay, first thing is, though, I don't want to run too soon because it costs too much money then.
[01:57:37.087 --> 01:57:39.468]  And I want to do it when they get the Pikers out.
[01:57:39.468 --> 01:57:40.409]  Get rid of the Pikers.
[01:57:40.409 --> 01:57:42.710]  Get it when it's down to two.
[01:57:42.710 --> 01:57:44.671]  Which, with the Libertarian, it'd be perfect.
[01:57:44.671 --> 01:57:45.912]  That's June of next year.
[01:57:47.190 --> 01:57:51.355]  And then you time it out, Alex, June to November.
[01:57:51.355 --> 01:57:52.476]  That's how you do it.
[01:57:52.476 --> 01:57:53.598]  It's that simple.
[01:57:53.598 --> 01:57:55.239]  Your timing has to be correct.
[01:57:55.239 --> 01:58:02.348]  If you get in too soon, you'll blow your wad too soon, and you'll give them too much of a chance to destroy you.
[01:58:03.271 --> 01:58:10.598]  You gotta have the perfect timing that leads up to that November election, and it's a window in there of about two to three months, four months.
[01:58:10.598 --> 01:58:12.079]  I want to hear more about this.
[01:58:12.079 --> 01:58:12.560]  We're back.
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:15.042]  I don't need to go get name recognition.
[01:58:15.042 --> 01:58:16.864]  So it can be done that way, Alex.
[01:58:16.864 --> 01:58:18.945]  We don't need to move on presidential shit.
[01:58:18.945 --> 01:58:19.586]  Seventy seconds.
[01:58:19.586 --> 01:58:19.906]  We're back.
[01:58:19.906 --> 01:58:20.847]  I want to hear more about this.
[01:58:20.847 --> 01:58:21.868]  Seventy seconds.
[01:58:21.868 --> 01:58:24.070]  We're back.
[01:58:24.070 --> 01:58:28.054]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:31.229 --> 01:58:32.150]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:58:32.150 --> 01:58:32.690]  Good, brother.
[01:58:32.690 --> 01:58:34.672]  I just recently started using your products.
[01:58:34.672 --> 01:58:36.394]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:58:36.394 --> 01:58:40.418]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:58:40.418 --> 01:58:43.040]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:45.462]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:58:45.462 --> 01:58:53.410]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:58:53.630 --> 01:58:56.874]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:58:56.874 --> 01:58:58.416]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:58:58.416 --> 01:59:01.459]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:59:01.459 --> 01:59:03.101]  They've been a ton of money there.
[01:59:03.101 --> 01:59:08.507]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[01:59:08.767 --> 01:59:11.768]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:59:47.369 --> 01:59:48.669]  Big Brother.
[01:59:48.669 --> 01:59:50.450]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:50.450 --> 01:59:52.211]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:52.211 --> 01:59:53.791]  You want answers?
[01:59:53.791 --> 01:59:55.332]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:55.332 --> 01:59:59.513]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:59.513 --> 02:00:09.137]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.137 --> 02:00:11.678]  Coming up, the suspect in the shootings advocated race war.
[02:00:11.678 --> 02:00:12.518]  I said that yesterday.
[02:00:13.905 --> 02:00:16.446]  Wanted to start a race war right before Juneteenth.
[02:00:16.446 --> 02:00:18.147]  Was he smart enough to figure it out himself?
[02:00:18.147 --> 02:00:19.308]  I think he had handlers.
[02:00:19.308 --> 02:00:20.448]  Reverend Shoulders does too.
[02:00:20.448 --> 02:00:21.489]  That's coming up.
[02:00:21.489 --> 02:00:24.410]  Former Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[02:00:24.410 --> 02:00:28.012]  He just joined us bombshell after bombshell last hour.
[02:00:28.012 --> 02:00:42.399]  The New York Times, with 32 other major media companies, with literally hundreds if not thousands of viciniaries between them, are joining a lawsuit in appeal in amicus briefs trying to defeat Ventura.
[02:00:44.423 --> 02:00:48.665]  And asking the court, let us have unjust enrichment off lies.
[02:00:48.665 --> 02:00:51.686]  They're saying, we want you to certify we can do this in their briefing.
[02:00:51.686 --> 02:00:59.210]  Governor, I know you're about to get back into president and running for president and in a state of the world, but just briefly on that subject for the media, they're going to want to know.
[02:00:59.210 --> 02:01:02.792]  I looked around, I tried to go on the law sites and find this filing by them.
[02:01:02.792 --> 02:01:04.673]  I know you have a copy.
[02:01:04.673 --> 02:01:09.575]  Is there a way you could scan it and email it to us so that we can put it in an article we're writing?
[02:01:10.135 --> 02:01:10.836]  Oh, sure.
[02:01:10.836 --> 02:01:12.117]  I'll take care of that, Alex.
[02:01:12.117 --> 02:01:14.358]  I'll get it to you before Monday.
[02:01:14.358 --> 02:01:15.018]  Fantastic.
[02:01:15.018 --> 02:01:16.399]  Wouldn't be a problem.
[02:01:16.399 --> 02:01:17.300]  And let me say this.
[02:01:17.300 --> 02:01:19.501]  Let me appeal to your listeners for a minute.
[02:01:19.501 --> 02:01:22.283]  This mainstream media, here's the deal, too.
[02:01:22.283 --> 02:01:24.125]  They're not talking about this.
[02:01:24.125 --> 02:01:31.149]  So what people can do right now, call your mainstream media, whoever it might be, because they're going to fall under these 33.
[02:01:31.149 --> 02:01:32.370]  You know they will.
[02:01:32.370 --> 02:01:39.495]  And ask why they're not reporting on what they're doing, that they're attempting to overthrow the Jesse Ventura verdict.
[02:01:40.295 --> 02:01:42.275]  And why are they not reporting on that?
[02:01:42.275 --> 02:01:44.096]  Why are they keeping quiet?
[02:01:44.096 --> 02:01:49.817]  When 33 of them are attempting to do it, why is that not news in itself?
[02:01:49.817 --> 02:01:59.619]  That's another big piece of news that used to, when a company was being reported on and it owned a media company, they would have to disclose, by the way, that's the parent company of us.
[02:01:59.619 --> 02:02:00.899]  Now they don't do that.
[02:02:00.899 --> 02:02:09.541]  They're there trying to destroy you and Fox never mentions, by the way, we own the movie and the book and are making hundreds of millions off this Kyle fiction.
[02:02:10.569 --> 02:02:11.429]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:02:11.429 --> 02:02:20.173]  And the thing, what people can do, ask why they're not reporting this fact that they're attempting to overthrow a federal jury decision.
[02:02:20.173 --> 02:02:20.993]  There's your headline.
[02:02:20.993 --> 02:02:25.975]  New York Times and others trying to overthrow jury decision that media can be held accountable for lying.
[02:02:25.975 --> 02:02:27.696]  That's sensational news right there.
[02:02:27.696 --> 02:02:30.237]  Yep, because that's what they're working to do.
[02:02:30.237 --> 02:02:31.718]  That's what this brief is about.
[02:02:31.718 --> 02:02:32.958]  33 of them signed on.
[02:02:32.958 --> 02:02:33.839]  It's 45 pages long.
[02:02:37.461 --> 02:02:40.222]  And, you know, they got these top lawyers out there.
[02:02:40.222 --> 02:02:41.863]  Who are the lawyers?
[02:02:41.863 --> 02:02:45.504]  Floyd Abrams, Susan Buckley, Miriam McHale, and K.O.
[02:02:45.504 --> 02:02:47.545]  Gordon, and Randall LP, A.D.
[02:02:47.545 --> 02:02:49.565]  Pine Street, New York, New York.
[02:02:49.565 --> 02:02:57.288]  So, it's the big time New York, New York lawyers coming after little Jesse Ventura in Minneapolis.
[02:02:57.288 --> 02:03:00.349]  Well, they're going to have a big fight on their hand with the Slovak German.
[02:03:03.283 --> 02:03:04.663]  I tell you, it is just crazy.
[02:03:04.663 --> 02:03:13.866]  But listen, at a core level, even though you've spent millions and exhausted yourself and all this, doesn't it feel good, though, that you've done the right thing and won the jury trial?
[02:03:13.866 --> 02:03:16.427]  Well, Alex, it's always this way.
[02:03:16.427 --> 02:03:23.929]  Like I said during when we have discussions of settlement, I said I cannot settle unless I can go home and look at myself in the mirror.
[02:03:26.297 --> 02:03:28.578]  And they said, we'll give you money and we won't appeal it.
[02:03:28.578 --> 02:03:31.760]  You just gotta drop it and say we're not liars.
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:33.660]  No, they haven't even done that.
[02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:44.665]  They haven't even... I don't want to get into the specifics of it because it's confidential, but they haven't even offered me what I've paid lawyer fees.
[02:03:44.665 --> 02:03:47.207]  I had gotten confused reading the papers, but they get it so wrong.
[02:03:47.207 --> 02:03:52.129]  I had read that they'd offered you stuff, but you just had to like not argue the fact anymore.
[02:03:53.654 --> 02:03:55.115]  No, not at all.
[02:03:55.115 --> 02:03:58.018]  They've been tight vested.
[02:03:58.018 --> 02:04:07.386]  They've wasted four or five days of my life on these meetings to settle because they're worthless.
[02:04:07.386 --> 02:04:09.268]  Let me throw this to you in closing and I appreciate your time.
[02:04:09.268 --> 02:04:12.430]  We'll talk to you next week and I want to get behind you because we're all together on this.
[02:04:13.351 --> 02:04:22.099]  If you run for president, you'll also be able to make them being liars part of it, and use that bully pulpit they can't ignore to further expose them.
[02:04:22.099 --> 02:04:25.742]  I think you gotta run, and I think you're getting closer to running, aren't you, Jesse?
[02:04:25.742 --> 02:04:27.063]  I think you got the fire in the belly.
[02:04:27.063 --> 02:04:27.524]  Do you have it?
[02:04:29.238 --> 02:04:29.958]  Not yet.
[02:04:29.958 --> 02:04:31.960]  I gotta get this behind me first.
[02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:34.601]  Alright, well I'll try to call and bug you later today or Monday.
[02:04:34.601 --> 02:04:37.523]  Let's stay in touch and let's get you back on and we'll get the story out.
[02:04:37.523 --> 02:04:39.745]  Alright, Alex, and thank you very, very much.
[02:04:39.745 --> 02:04:40.546]  I appreciate it.
[02:04:40.546 --> 02:04:42.307]  Hang in there and hi to all your listeners.
[02:04:45.909 --> 02:04:50.351]  One way to defeat centralized money printing and devaluation is to start a state-owned bank.
[02:04:50.351 --> 02:04:52.131]  And Texas is leading the charge.
[02:04:52.131 --> 02:04:53.232]  Zero hedge rights.
[02:04:53.232 --> 02:04:56.333]  The lack of faith in central bank trustworthiness is spreading.
[02:04:56.333 --> 02:05:05.956]  Texas has enacted HB 483, a bill to repatriate $1 billion of gold from the New York Fed vaults to a newly established state gold bullion depository.
[02:05:05.956 --> 02:05:09.177]  The bill also includes a section to prevent forced seizures from the federal government.
[02:05:09.897 --> 02:05:20.585]  Section A2116.023 of the bill states, a purported confiscation requisition seizure or other forced attempt to control the ownership is void and of no force or effect.
[02:05:20.585 --> 02:05:25.549]  Effectively, the state of Texas will protect any gold stored in the depository from the federal government.
[02:05:25.549 --> 02:05:33.075]  And by being free from the threat of confiscation, private citizens can use the gold and silver as money, completely bypassing the paper money system.
[02:05:33.075 --> 02:05:36.737]  This is just a small step to defeat the central banks that print money for nothing.
[02:05:36.737 --> 02:05:38.639]  Rob Due reporting for InfoWars.com
[02:05:41.161 --> 02:05:46.305]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.

[02:06:21.272 --> 02:06:25.097]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[02:06:40.936 --> 02:06:42.177]  Another major health threat.
[02:06:42.177 --> 02:06:47.160]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:06:47.160 --> 02:06:49.842]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:06:49.842 --> 02:06:56.886]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:06:56.886 --> 02:06:59.888]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:06:59.888 --> 02:07:02.830]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:07:02.830 --> 02:07:04.851]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:07:04.851 --> 02:07:07.693]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:07:07.773 --> 02:07:13.495]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:07:13.495 --> 02:07:16.997]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:07:16.997 --> 02:07:20.078]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:07:42.227 --> 02:07:44.609]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:07:44.609 --> 02:07:45.489]  A lie!
[02:07:45.489 --> 02:07:47.491]  No man is obsolete!
[02:07:47.491 --> 02:07:49.372]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:07:49.372 --> 02:07:52.614]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[02:07:52.614 --> 02:07:58.058]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[02:07:58.058 --> 02:07:59.739]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:07:59.739 --> 02:08:01.240]  A crawling insect!
[02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:05.903]  An ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[02:08:05.903 --> 02:08:07.424]  I am a human being!
[02:08:07.424 --> 02:08:09.866]  You're a librarian, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:08:10.586 --> 02:08:20.312]  You're a dealer in books and two-cent fines and pamphlets and clothes stacks and the musty insides of a language factory that spews out meaningless words on an assembly line.
[02:08:20.312 --> 02:08:33.579]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind, like a vacuum that you make believe has an existence by scribbling index numbers on little cards.
[02:08:33.579 --> 02:08:34.280]  I don't care.
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:35.720]  I tell you, I don't care.
[02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:37.321]  I'm a human being.
[02:08:37.321 --> 02:08:37.822]  I exist.
[02:08:38.834 --> 02:08:45.039]  And if I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[02:08:45.039 --> 02:08:48.182]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[02:08:48.182 --> 02:08:52.985]  Delusions that you inject into your veins with printer's ink!
[02:08:52.985 --> 02:08:55.748]  The narcotics that you call literature!
[02:08:55.748 --> 02:08:57.209]  The Bible!
[02:08:57.209 --> 02:08:58.390]  Poetry!
[02:08:58.390 --> 02:09:00.892]  Essays of all kind, all of it, and opiates!
[02:09:01.172 --> 02:09:05.273]  To make you think you have a strength when you have no strength at all!
[02:09:05.273 --> 02:09:08.234]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream!
[02:09:08.234 --> 02:09:16.997]  And the state has no use for your kind!
[02:09:16.997 --> 02:09:21.578]  You waste our time, Mr. Wordsworth, and you're not worth the waste.
[02:09:21.578 --> 02:09:23.018]  Instruct him!
[02:09:23.018 --> 02:09:27.860]  Romney Wordsworth, step back to await the finding of this board.
[02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:28.120]  Yes, sir.
[02:09:33.837 --> 02:09:36.720]  The state has no use for you.
[02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:41.586]  How do you find, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:09:41.586 --> 02:09:42.326]  Obsolete.
[02:09:42.326 --> 02:09:43.007]  Obsolete.
[02:09:43.007 --> 02:09:44.249]  Obsolete.
[02:09:44.249 --> 02:09:45.130]  Obsolete.
[02:09:45.130 --> 02:09:47.492]  I concur.
[02:09:47.492 --> 02:09:52.538]  Romney Wordsworth, step forward.
[02:09:52.538 --> 02:09:55.061]  The board finds you obsolete.
[02:09:59.874 --> 02:10:06.597]  And they are announcing in the Financial Times of London today, French invent robots to replace border police.
[02:10:06.597 --> 02:10:18.923]  The French government two years ago under Nicolas Sarkozy announced their new future plan initiative is to replace all workers with robots and driverless cars.
[02:10:18.923 --> 02:10:21.565]  It's the decision to end the world of people.
[02:10:22.495 --> 02:10:33.266]  And we start with the black children and the innate underlying racism that was still in some people in the early 1970s to get abortion passed.
[02:10:33.266 --> 02:10:36.449]  Because it was going to be for getting rid of the minorities.
[02:10:36.449 --> 02:10:38.431]  And that's what Margaret Sanger set it all up for.
[02:10:38.431 --> 02:10:40.673]  And that's what it's always been about.
[02:10:42.594 --> 02:10:45.015]  And that's why this country is cursed, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:45.015 --> 02:10:52.360]  If you don't look at children and want to protect them and love them, no matter what color they are, there's something wrong with you fundamentally.
[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:55.222]  And now, as a society, we're being aborted.
[02:10:55.222 --> 02:10:56.983]  Our future, our culture, our jobs.
[02:10:56.983 --> 02:11:00.165]  Old people are put on don't-treat lists and death lists and death panels.
[02:11:00.165 --> 02:11:01.125]  It's all admitted.
[02:11:01.125 --> 02:11:05.328]  The case for killing Granny covered a Newsweek.
[02:11:05.328 --> 02:11:07.249]  They didn't brag about it until they got it passed, though.
[02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:21.098]  And now the Watson computers from the company that brought you so much of what Hitler did, IBM, are running the actuary to decide who gets healthcare and who doesn't.
[02:11:21.098 --> 02:11:30.205]  And there's don't treat list for veterans who have operable diseases because the Watson computer says they don't get treatment.
[02:11:30.205 --> 02:11:31.346]  The same IBM computers.
[02:11:32.859 --> 02:11:34.780]  And then, humans don't have to feel bad.
[02:11:34.780 --> 02:11:36.682]  The bioethics board doesn't have to feel bad.
[02:11:36.682 --> 02:11:36.942]  Why?
[02:11:36.942 --> 02:11:43.807]  A computer just said, you don't get that knee surgery, you don't get that heart surgery, you don't get that skin cancer removed.
[02:11:43.807 --> 02:11:45.288]  Here's some pain pills.
[02:11:45.288 --> 02:11:47.489]  Go bomb your brain out of existence.
[02:11:47.489 --> 02:11:54.634]  Because under the Bertrand Russell School of Socialism, if you're not contributing, you're obsolete.
[02:11:54.634 --> 02:12:00.959]  At the bottom of the hour, we're going to play the intro of that, as I did a few days ago, with Rod Serling, who was a combat paratrooper.
[02:12:02.267 --> 02:12:06.609]  Going in, Battle of the Bulls, Hill 9 Yards, a war hero, great writer.
[02:12:06.609 --> 02:12:12.390]  That's why so many of the Twilight Zone episodes are about tyranny and oppression.
[02:12:12.390 --> 02:12:17.592]  Because see, for modern people that haven't been under that much tyranny, we can sit back and make fun of people that are worried about it.
[02:12:17.592 --> 02:12:25.295]  But wait until you physically go under it, and when you're begging for help, people are going to say, oh, you deserve it, or you're not human, or you're whatever you are.
[02:12:26.752 --> 02:12:30.173]  The first rule of tyranny is that you devalue human life.
[02:12:30.173 --> 02:12:37.575]  And what Christ said is, what you do to the least of me, you've done to me.
[02:12:37.575 --> 02:12:45.198]  And now they take nine dead people and they humanize them as they should these babies and as they should these people.
[02:12:45.198 --> 02:12:46.238]  I don't care what color they are.
[02:12:48.012 --> 02:12:51.993]  And they rub the salt in, though, because they don't normally humanize people.
[02:12:51.993 --> 02:12:53.654]  Oh, it's just an old person we killed.
[02:12:53.654 --> 02:12:54.554]  Oh, it's just a baby.
[02:12:54.554 --> 02:12:58.955]  Oh, it's just a... Oh, it's just 14 people killed a week in Chicago, mainly black, shooting each other.
[02:12:58.955 --> 02:12:59.536]  Ignore that.
[02:12:59.536 --> 02:13:02.516]  There won't be any speeches about that.
[02:13:02.516 --> 02:13:04.517]  What big government did to these people?
[02:13:04.517 --> 02:13:06.518]  What does anybody that gets under it?
[02:13:06.518 --> 02:13:08.118]  They were the beta test.
[02:13:08.118 --> 02:13:10.459]  No, it's, oh, it was the whites.
[02:13:10.459 --> 02:13:10.819]  They did it.
[02:13:10.819 --> 02:13:15.440]  In fact, Salon says whites are going to have to pay for what they've done.
[02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:16.941]  Of course, that's a white writer saying that.
[02:13:19.597 --> 02:13:27.925]  And preachers say we're worried about race war, and all the rest of it, while the global economy melts down, while the TPP is passed out of the House yesterday.
[02:13:27.925 --> 02:13:36.793]  We're all obsessing, and you know, you have to obsess over it, because if you don't counter it, their propaganda will take over.
[02:13:36.793 --> 02:13:42.158]  But it turns out the shooter was on an amnesiac drug, as I predicted in the first hour, hours before it came out.
[02:13:44.778 --> 02:13:48.881]  And it turns out, they're even saying they think he probably had help and advisors.
[02:13:48.881 --> 02:13:51.563]  But why is there a bigger investigation of that?
[02:13:51.563 --> 02:13:58.007]  Obviously he was wound up.
[02:13:58.007 --> 02:13:59.288]  And it's all perfect timing.
[02:13:59.288 --> 02:14:00.008]  Here's the headline.
[02:14:00.008 --> 02:14:00.849]  Salon.
[02:14:00.849 --> 02:14:06.072]  White America must answer for the Charleston church massacre.
[02:14:06.072 --> 02:14:06.373]  As if!
[02:14:07.383 --> 02:14:10.305]  When a white person kills somebody, it's your fault if you're white.
[02:14:10.305 --> 02:14:13.868]  Or if a black person commits a crime, all black people are guilty.
[02:14:13.868 --> 02:14:21.294]  That's the opposite of what Martin Luther King preached about, and it's the opposite of common sense!
[02:14:21.294 --> 02:14:29.520]  I had, like I said in the first hour, groups of white rednecks start fights with me.
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:30.380]  Many, many times.
[02:14:31.243 --> 02:14:33.344]  Because they didn't know who I was.
[02:14:33.344 --> 02:14:34.325]  They were basically a gang.
[02:14:34.325 --> 02:14:35.625]  I've had black people do the same thing.
[02:14:35.625 --> 02:14:37.206]  But not because they were black.
[02:14:37.206 --> 02:14:38.907]  It was because they were in a gang mentality.
[02:14:38.907 --> 02:14:40.268]  It's the same mentality.
[02:14:40.268 --> 02:14:50.213]  And they want to put us into that mentality where we don't communicate, where we don't come together, because then we can be enslaved by this whole global corporate takeover.
[02:14:50.213 --> 02:14:54.415]  For the rest of the hour, from blackgenocide.org is Reverend Childress.
[02:14:55.987 --> 02:15:06.255]  One of the most insightful, intelligent people I know when it comes to eugenics, the history of it, the master plan, blackgenocide.org, incredible videos, articles, abortion information.
[02:15:06.255 --> 02:15:09.917]  He travels the country and his ministry needs to be supported.
[02:15:09.917 --> 02:15:10.958]  He's gone to Congress.
[02:15:10.958 --> 02:15:16.062]  He's been involved in making films about black genocide that Congress has seen.
[02:15:16.062 --> 02:15:17.023]  He's had a huge effect.
[02:15:18.208 --> 02:15:21.852]  Leonard Sheldress really didn't buy any of it yesterday.
[02:15:21.852 --> 02:15:24.615]  I was on the fence whether this could be wound up or staged.
[02:15:24.615 --> 02:15:28.920]  I couldn't tell, but then he pointed out Juneteenth's this weekend.
[02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:30.942]  We finish our sermons on Thursday and Friday.
[02:15:30.942 --> 02:15:32.524]  The NAACP's coming up.
[02:15:32.524 --> 02:15:34.406]  Obama's primed the whole thing.
[02:15:34.406 --> 02:15:36.228]  Somebody else is probably behind this.
[02:15:37.418 --> 02:15:39.579]  Bare minimum, this guy was known.
[02:15:39.579 --> 02:15:41.060]  Bare minimum, he was in the system.
[02:15:41.060 --> 02:15:44.442]  Bare minimum, just like Fast and Furious, they stand to gain.
[02:15:44.442 --> 02:15:48.364]  So Reverend Childress joins us from blackgenocide.org.
[02:15:48.364 --> 02:16:01.892]  So much is happening, so much is going on, but this tragedy also serves as a juicy distraction while they're ramming through open borders, while they're ramming through TPP, while Europe's collapsing.
[02:16:01.892 --> 02:16:03.773]  I tell you, perfect timing, Reverend.
[02:16:05.066 --> 02:16:09.449]  Absolutely, and certainly it goes beyond this young man.
[02:16:09.449 --> 02:16:19.316]  This was very strategically done, and sure enough, he knew that indeed the intent was for a race war.
[02:16:19.316 --> 02:16:27.822]  He certainly picked the right place, the right time, the right state, as I stated yesterday, due to the Walter Scott issue.
[02:16:27.822 --> 02:16:34.107]  That was the clearest violation of a man's rights under the custody of the police.
[02:16:34.767 --> 02:16:36.728]  And so they picked that particular state.
[02:16:36.728 --> 02:16:42.110]  This is really getting very intense, and I'm praying so far.
[02:16:42.110 --> 02:16:45.672]  You knew there was going to be a lot of rhetoric that came out of this.
[02:16:45.672 --> 02:16:48.753]  But as you said, it is a major distraction.
[02:16:48.753 --> 02:16:51.294]  You can't ignore what has happened, though.
[02:16:51.294 --> 02:16:57.597]  But it appears that the agenda of government, as you have pointed out, is going full steam ahead.
[02:16:57.597 --> 02:17:03.880]  And so really, it is a time for saintly people to say enough's enough.
[02:17:04.780 --> 02:17:11.209]  And hopefully we can have healing out of this situation.
[02:17:11.209 --> 02:17:17.817]  But that young man, it was a dastardly act, but he's a victim too.
[02:17:17.817 --> 02:17:19.439]  And I know many people will not...
[02:17:20.413 --> 02:17:21.774]  Agree what I just said.
[02:17:21.774 --> 02:17:23.956]  I think it was used.
[02:17:23.956 --> 02:17:31.783]  I think he was abused and used and created this horrific incident.
[02:17:31.783 --> 02:17:43.713]  But let's not just stop with him and feel it's just an isolated, you know, I would pray it's an isolated incident, but it was just the timing and.
[02:17:45.114 --> 02:17:45.835]  His language.
[02:17:45.835 --> 02:17:49.459]  And I'd love to find out where he was reading.
[02:17:49.459 --> 02:17:51.681]  Listen, I'm pretty smart and well-read.
[02:17:51.681 --> 02:17:53.102]  I couldn't come up with this.
[02:17:53.102 --> 02:17:56.986]  I mean, like you said, you've got a really deep knowledge of history about all this.
[02:17:56.986 --> 02:17:59.649]  When you looked at the angles, it all crystallized.
[02:17:59.649 --> 02:18:01.851]  You can just see the whole thing perfectly scripted.
[02:18:01.851 --> 02:18:02.212]  Everything.
[02:18:02.862 --> 02:18:04.784]  Oh yeah, it was well done.
[02:18:04.784 --> 02:18:06.306]  I give kudos to them.
[02:18:06.306 --> 02:18:08.469]  Well done, well timed.
[02:18:08.469 --> 02:18:10.331]  And you're coming up on the summer months.
[02:18:10.331 --> 02:18:11.952]  Give me a break.
[02:18:11.952 --> 02:18:20.682]  And even in Baltimore, they're still talking about they really don't know if it's subsided yet because we're coming up to the summer months.
[02:18:21.763 --> 02:18:23.625]  Um, this is really sad.
[02:18:23.625 --> 02:18:27.428]  You know, the church really has to be salt and light right now.
[02:18:27.428 --> 02:18:36.877]  And so, uh, we're, um, I understand he had black friends on Facebook that he coerced with, that he dialogued with.
[02:18:36.877 --> 02:18:42.041]  So, um, I... They're now saying he prayed with the people inside, they think.
[02:18:42.041 --> 02:18:48.127]  It sounds like he was under, either completely insane or under mind control, and he was on this amnesic drug.
[02:18:48.871 --> 02:18:50.792]  Yes, exactly.
[02:18:50.792 --> 02:18:52.412]  I agree with that.
[02:18:52.412 --> 02:19:04.415]  I'm not, you know, as far-fetched, you know, for some who may hear this, may feel, but you gotta understand, a lot of the, we still don't know about Martin Luther King's assassination.
[02:19:04.415 --> 02:19:05.735]  We don't know about many of his assassinations.
[02:19:05.735 --> 02:19:06.576]  Oh, I've had his lawyers on.
[02:19:06.576 --> 02:19:07.936]  I mean, I've had all the people on.
[02:19:07.936 --> 02:19:10.157]  I mean, clearly that was a setup.
[02:19:10.157 --> 02:19:14.978]  Yes, and so, and most society feels it stopped at Earl Ray.
[02:19:15.878 --> 02:19:23.887]  Um, you get frustrated with people sometimes because they really have to objectively look at it and not get so emotionally tied into it.
[02:19:23.887 --> 02:19:32.556]  But, um, right now only, and I hope, you know, I know I'm giving somewhat abstract responses and what the answer to this is, but...
[02:19:34.198 --> 02:19:36.460]  It is unquestionably a spiritual one at this point.
[02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:36.620]  It is.
[02:19:36.620 --> 02:19:37.321]  Stay there, Reverend.

[02:20:41.442 --> 02:20:45.567]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[02:20:45.567 --> 02:20:48.751]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[02:20:48.751 --> 02:20:50.373]  Does that sound right to you?

[02:21:13.239 --> 02:21:15.040]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:21:15.040 --> 02:21:16.681]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:21:16.681 --> 02:21:19.503]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:21:19.503 --> 02:21:21.804]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:21:21.804 --> 02:21:26.307]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:21:26.307 --> 02:21:30.249]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[02:21:42.049 --> 02:21:48.792]  Usually, the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[02:21:48.792 --> 02:21:53.173]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[02:21:53.173 --> 02:21:56.675]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[02:21:56.675 --> 02:21:57.815]  Not fun!
[02:21:57.815 --> 02:22:06.218]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[02:22:06.218 --> 02:22:10.980]  One World Whey is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[02:22:11.300 --> 02:22:12.481]  My name is Errol.

[02:22:14.002 --> 02:22:16.583]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[02:22:16.583 --> 02:22:24.448]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your Trace Mineral Supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[02:22:24.448 --> 02:22:30.732]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[02:22:30.732 --> 02:22:31.232]  Call 888-988-3325.

[02:23:42.424 --> 02:23:48.225]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:48.225 --> 02:23:50.446]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:23:52.799 --> 02:24:06.912]  Dylan Storm Ruth is on TV right now in front of the judge, but from a jail cell with two people in combat tactical gear, which you would never have in a prison or a jail cell, a woman in a commando outfit.
[02:24:06.912 --> 02:24:09.914]  All of this is like out of central casting or something.
[02:24:09.914 --> 02:24:12.617]  There's a blow up of his face while he listens to the judge.
[02:24:12.617 --> 02:24:18.722]  We can back out and show you the police in military gear, one black cop and one looks like a female.
[02:24:19.483 --> 02:24:20.643]  An elfin female.
[02:24:20.643 --> 02:24:22.644]  I just say that because I can't figure out if it's a man or a woman.
[02:24:22.644 --> 02:24:24.125]  I think it's a woman.
[02:24:24.125 --> 02:24:30.767]  And nowhere do you have people in tactical gear, but it's all part of this theater.
[02:24:30.767 --> 02:24:40.850]  This whole thing is so Orwellian that he's there and doesn't look as insane as he did in some of the other photos and earlier.
[02:24:41.986 --> 02:24:49.856]  But this is truly sickening, and we'll probably never find out what's really behind all this, but something stinks.
[02:24:49.856 --> 02:24:52.859]  Reverend Childress is our guest, blackgenocide.org.
[02:24:55.990 --> 02:24:58.571]  Regardless, this is a big distraction.
[02:24:58.571 --> 02:25:01.773]  We have to cover it, though, to respond to it.
[02:25:01.773 --> 02:25:07.936]  I just hope that it doesn't trigger more copycat events by, quote, either side.
[02:25:07.936 --> 02:25:09.997]  This is meant to make people go into sides.
[02:25:09.997 --> 02:25:11.918]  What are other observations, Reverend?
[02:25:13.274 --> 02:25:28.352]  Well, it's right now, if you're watching the news, that the clergy are now taking precautions in their services, basically, which will heighten the hysteria, you know, the hysteria, I believe.
[02:25:29.753 --> 02:25:34.174]  They're planning broader means of safety for the congregation.
[02:25:34.174 --> 02:25:43.777]  I think that should be done in this day and age anyway, but the fact of the matter is it's all being done at this same time due to this incident.
[02:25:43.777 --> 02:25:47.338]  I don't know how this is going to play out simply because I don't really know
[02:25:48.358 --> 02:25:56.205]  How the church is really going to respond to this particular atrocity.
[02:25:56.205 --> 02:25:59.927]  You know, and here's why I say this.
[02:25:59.927 --> 02:26:06.713]  I really appreciated the brothers down there in Florida when the case where
[02:26:08.434 --> 02:26:09.614]  Oh, what's the young man?
[02:26:09.614 --> 02:26:11.815]  Oh gosh, I'm losing it.
[02:26:11.815 --> 02:26:12.776]  Trayvon Martin?
[02:26:12.776 --> 02:26:14.156]  Yes, Trayvon Martin.
[02:26:14.156 --> 02:26:28.861]  The church responded very quickly, very quickly, and they tried, made every effort to defuse any racial tension within the churches and within the community.
[02:26:28.861 --> 02:26:30.321]  That was outstanding.
[02:26:30.321 --> 02:26:32.002]  In the South Carolina case,
[02:26:33.095 --> 02:26:33.355]  I think?
[02:26:48.366 --> 02:26:57.692]  You know, it could get to the point where, as Al Sharpton said, this is the new low in racial hatred in America.
[02:26:57.692 --> 02:26:59.834]  I don't know how that's going to be taken.
[02:26:59.834 --> 02:27:04.116]  I don't know if that type of language is going to continue.
[02:27:04.116 --> 02:27:07.178]  Instead, it's something that's going to heal the people.
[02:27:07.178 --> 02:27:08.299]  Well, we know this.
[02:27:08.299 --> 02:27:14.563]  If Al Sharpton and others go in there with their regular, insinuary rhetoric, this could get bad.
[02:27:14.563 --> 02:27:15.103]  Exactly.
[02:27:16.284 --> 02:27:29.707]  I used to feel that America could get past this point we're at right now, but the reason why the tension is as it is is because everything now is being done deliberate.
[02:27:29.707 --> 02:27:30.807]  This is deliberate.
[02:27:30.807 --> 02:27:32.467]  I don't care what anybody says.
[02:27:32.467 --> 02:27:40.429]  This is deliberate and only cooler heads must prevail, only the salt and light of the church must step up.
[02:27:41.309 --> 02:27:51.193]  And we must also, you know, as you've been stated earlier, America's most egregious sin is that we do kill the innocent.
[02:27:51.193 --> 02:27:56.115]  The shedding of innocent blood pollutes the land.
[02:27:56.115 --> 02:28:03.778]  We're kind of bringing a lot of this on ourselves for others to work these schemes of murder and division and strife and hatred.
[02:28:04.778 --> 02:28:10.683]  There's so much on the table here, Alex, I really sometimes get somewhat overwhelmed by it.
[02:28:10.683 --> 02:28:13.245]  But we have to point out truth.
[02:28:13.245 --> 02:28:18.550]  Truth is essential for a person to come from delusion and lie.
[02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:23.394]  So the church really is the only institution I see right now that can step up.
[02:28:24.162 --> 02:28:24.782]  I agree with you.
[02:28:24.782 --> 02:28:26.923]  We're going to go to break in a moment with a long segment coming up.
[02:28:26.923 --> 02:28:30.225]  I want to come back again to Obama's comments blaming the Second Amendment.
[02:28:30.225 --> 02:28:35.548]  But let's go ahead and play a clip from ABC News where his friends are saying, no, he wanted to start a race war.
[02:28:35.548 --> 02:28:36.008]  Here's the clip.
[02:28:37.887 --> 02:28:45.475]  A fresh-faced accused killer, Dylan Roof, hands behind his back a bulletproof vest just hours after his arrest.
[02:28:45.475 --> 02:28:47.558]  Silent as he's asked, why did he do it?
[02:28:47.558 --> 02:28:49.600]  Dylan, what do you have to say?
[02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:54.045]  Just 21 years old, friends say Roof's alleged plan was six months in the making.
[02:28:54.045 --> 02:28:58.710]  Today, this friend sends childhood telling me Roof had a deep hatred of black people.
[02:28:59.150 --> 02:29:00.331]  He wanted segregation.
[02:29:00.331 --> 02:29:01.312]  What did he want to see happen?
[02:29:01.312 --> 02:29:02.093]  How was he going to do this?
[02:29:02.093 --> 02:29:04.475]  I think he wanted something big like Trayvon Martin.
[02:29:04.475 --> 02:29:07.058]  He wanted to make something spark up the race war again.
[02:29:07.058 --> 02:29:09.861]  In this photo, flag patches on Roof's jacket.
[02:29:09.861 --> 02:29:13.324]  One from Apartheid era South Africa, the other from the former Rohingya.
[02:29:13.324 --> 02:29:17.128]  This is pure idiocy to all the people that have some mythical race war idea.
[02:29:17.128 --> 02:29:21.372]  All you're going to do is bring in martial law and a globalist takeover, you idiots.
[02:29:21.372 --> 02:29:22.734]  This is so stupid.
[02:29:23.618 --> 02:29:25.519]  And we'll be back with Reverend Shoulders on the other side.
[02:29:25.519 --> 02:29:29.983]  I mean, are we this dumb to be played against each other like a bunch of idiots?
[02:29:29.983 --> 02:29:30.703]  So stupid!
[02:29:30.703 --> 02:29:32.064]  We're on the march.
[02:29:32.064 --> 02:29:34.586]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:34.586 --> 02:29:37.288]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:41.443 --> 02:29:45.287]  Obama's gun control will kill more blacks.
[02:29:45.287 --> 02:29:52.455]  President Barack Obama called for strict gun control in response to the Charleston, South Carolina church shooting.
[02:29:52.455 --> 02:29:55.838]  But that'll mean more deaths of African Americans.
[02:29:55.838 --> 02:30:03.847]  The president blames guns for the shooting which claimed nine lives at the historically black Emanuel AME church on Wednesday.
[02:30:04.227 --> 02:30:13.671]  However, the frequent violence which occurs in areas with strict gun laws totally debunks Obama's claim that gun control works.
[02:30:13.671 --> 02:30:16.732]  Simply put, more guns lead to less crime.
[02:30:16.732 --> 02:30:22.795]  Overall, guns are used 80 times more often to stop crime than they are used to kill people.
[02:30:22.995 --> 02:30:29.341]  Would you feel safer if you placed a sign on your door declaring that your home is a gun-free zone?
[02:30:29.341 --> 02:30:35.747]  Well, if not, then how could you possibly feel safer with those signs hanging up in public?
[02:30:35.747 --> 02:30:39.972]  You can learn more about these stories plus much more at InfoWars.com.

[02:32:55.365 --> 02:32:57.967]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:32:57.967 --> 02:33:03.271]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:03.271 --> 02:33:16.642]  I was born in the soul of misery and I never had me a name.
[02:33:16.642 --> 02:33:20.225]  They just give me a number.
[02:33:22.539 --> 02:33:27.963]  To have microchip identification devices implanted into their body.
[02:33:27.963 --> 02:33:36.009]  Got a long line of heartache, I carry it well.
[02:33:36.009 --> 02:33:40.132]  The list of lives I've broken, reach from here to hell.
[02:33:48.593 --> 02:33:59.299]  When Larry Nichols was on yesterday, former top Clinton insider, I really felt the weight of evil.
[02:33:59.299 --> 02:34:00.539]  And I've been on air 20 years.
[02:34:00.539 --> 02:34:02.360]  I've been politically involved 25 years.
[02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:07.083]  I have, I think, good six cents, discernment, whatever you want to call it.
[02:34:07.083 --> 02:34:09.464]  And I'm not trying to be negative here, but I just feel like...
[02:34:10.663 --> 02:34:17.425]  And we see it manifesting, and we see evil moving on every front, but I feel the evil increasing.
[02:34:17.425 --> 02:34:20.806]  And I feel it's lust to hurt innocent people.
[02:34:20.806 --> 02:34:33.911]  And it's just sickening, the spectacle, having to look at this whacked-out 21-year-old and hear about these people he murdered at church, and how he did it so dishonorably and sickeningly and treacherously.
[02:34:35.117 --> 02:34:49.405]  And it's done to shock the conscience, while the globalists commit all these incredible crimes like arming Al-Qaeda and ISIS to kill Christians by the hundreds of thousands all over the Middle East.
[02:34:49.405 --> 02:34:52.666]  And it's not even in our news.
[02:34:52.666 --> 02:34:56.008]  That's what's sick, is that they use our conscience.
[02:34:56.008 --> 02:34:58.930]  They use the fact that we have soft hearts, pink hearts.
[02:35:00.521 --> 02:35:10.704]  That we love God, that we're bitter clingers, that we don't want to hurt anybody, that we don't hate people.
[02:35:10.704 --> 02:35:18.426]  You know, I run into racists in people, and believe me, you could have black racists, white racists, Hispanic racists, whatever, it's all just tribal stuff.
[02:35:18.426 --> 02:35:22.987]  And they'll think, like, behind the scenes, and, hey, you're racist too, you know, like, make a racist joke, and you're just like, no.
[02:35:24.295 --> 02:35:25.916]  And they'll say, but they're racist.
[02:35:25.916 --> 02:35:30.039]  And I'll say, not all of them, and I'm not going to stoop to that level.
[02:35:30.039 --> 02:35:34.922]  It's not because I'm on some high horse either.
[02:35:34.922 --> 02:35:37.764]  This is what controls us is all this tribalism.
[02:35:37.764 --> 02:35:39.625]  It's how the British Empire controlled people.
[02:35:39.625 --> 02:35:41.527]  It's how the Romans controlled people.
[02:35:41.527 --> 02:35:45.489]  We either transcend this, folks, or it's over.
[02:35:45.489 --> 02:35:48.051]  They didn't kill Malcolm X when he was running around calling for violence.
[02:35:48.051 --> 02:35:51.033]  When he stopped calling for it is when they killed him.
[02:35:51.033 --> 02:35:52.594]  That's why they killed Martin Luther King.
[02:35:52.594 --> 02:35:53.935]  Because he had moral authority.
[02:35:56.510 --> 02:36:03.313]  And that's why they made up a bunch of stuff about Martin Luther King from both political sides to confuse the issue.
[02:36:03.313 --> 02:36:13.077]  It's because they don't want us to have a stable world, because in a stable world, it's based on what you produce and what you stand for and how good your word is.
[02:36:13.077 --> 02:36:14.537]  They want it to be on race.
[02:36:14.537 --> 02:36:16.318]  They want it to be on who your daddy was.
[02:36:16.318 --> 02:36:19.039]  They want it to be... That's what royalty is.
[02:36:19.039 --> 02:36:22.100]  That's what the Clinton family and the Bushes are.
[02:36:22.100 --> 02:36:23.201]  It's the same thing.
[02:36:25.888 --> 02:36:30.250]  The problem is they hype race up enough, you gotta watch out when you're in the wrong neighborhood.
[02:36:30.250 --> 02:36:33.011]  And black folks gotta watch out when they're in the wrong neighborhood.
[02:36:33.011 --> 02:36:39.934]  Because even though it's a fraud, it becomes real because they put it out long enough.
[02:36:39.934 --> 02:36:44.817]  And then even if you don't want to dislike people, you still gotta look out.
[02:36:44.817 --> 02:36:45.357]  If you're black.
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:47.861]  If you're white.
[02:36:47.861 --> 02:36:48.623]  If you're Hispanic.
[02:36:48.623 --> 02:36:49.664]  They got us all.
[02:36:49.664 --> 02:36:50.646]  Women against men.
[02:36:50.646 --> 02:36:51.707]  Men against women.
[02:36:51.707 --> 02:36:52.729]  You can see them.
[02:36:52.729 --> 02:36:54.431]  In fact, I never got to it with Father's Day coming up.
[02:36:54.431 --> 02:36:56.254]  I want to play and get children's take on this.
[02:36:56.254 --> 02:36:56.815]  I sent it to you.
[02:36:56.815 --> 02:36:58.337]  You guys tried to get me to play it last week.
[02:36:58.337 --> 02:36:59.038]  I never got to it.
[02:36:59.038 --> 02:37:00.180]  Or Monday.
[02:37:00.180 --> 02:37:00.500]  It's the...
[02:37:03.700 --> 02:37:05.101]  Paper ad, toilet paper ad?
[02:37:05.101 --> 02:37:09.484]  Yeah, AngelSoft ad, where it's like, no, we're not going to thank dad.
[02:37:09.484 --> 02:37:12.166]  Mom, my mom was my dad.
[02:37:12.166 --> 02:37:17.249]  Now that everybody's basically single parent, half the country or more, now to just say dads are good.
[02:37:17.249 --> 02:37:18.230]  No, you're not good.
[02:37:18.230 --> 02:37:19.471]  There isn't a good dad.
[02:37:19.471 --> 02:37:24.594]  Now dads just existing is bad.
[02:37:24.594 --> 02:37:28.517]  AngelSoft ad, which disparages fathers, gets huge negative backlash.
[02:37:31.049 --> 02:37:34.510]  Well, you take out the father, folks, you took out the whole family, and they've done it.
[02:37:34.510 --> 02:37:36.210]  We're going into such bondage.
[02:37:36.210 --> 02:37:47.473]  In every slave culture, men could not be fathers, and they were kept out, dumbed down, whether it was white slaves in Rome, or black slaves in the Caribbean, or the U.S.
[02:37:47.473 --> 02:37:50.854]  I mean, I'm a historian by just interest.
[02:37:50.854 --> 02:37:55.195]  I've read more history books than most historians, because most historians just specialize on one area.
[02:37:58.590 --> 02:38:02.033]  And I just see him playing this, and I don't like being a chump.
[02:38:02.033 --> 02:38:03.314]  I don't like being played.
[02:38:03.314 --> 02:38:05.456]  I don't like it!
[02:38:05.456 --> 02:38:07.598]  I don't like being a loser.
[02:38:07.598 --> 02:38:09.920]  I don't like my kids growing up in a world like this.
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:14.504]  It gets worse, not better.
[02:38:14.504 --> 02:38:21.050]  I'm gonna go back to Childress, because I'm ranting, and I invited him on, and I'm just... He's pretty much speechless today, too, and he's usually not, because I get it.
[02:38:21.050 --> 02:38:21.770]  I'm gonna see if he agrees with me.
[02:38:21.770 --> 02:38:23.212]  There's this weight.
[02:38:23.212 --> 02:38:25.013]  I really feel evil increasing right now, and...
[02:38:26.007 --> 02:38:27.508]  Ron Paul's talked about it some.
[02:38:27.508 --> 02:38:29.530]  We're going to play a clip of him warning today.
[02:38:29.530 --> 02:38:33.453]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:38:33.453 --> 02:38:35.554]  I'll just let you hear it in his own words.
[02:38:35.554 --> 02:38:36.615]  I'm not going to belabor this.
[02:38:36.615 --> 02:38:38.577]  I'm too freaked out.
[02:38:38.577 --> 02:38:42.620]  Because this shooting is just icing on the cake right now.
[02:38:42.620 --> 02:38:43.420]  Everything that's going on.
[02:38:43.420 --> 02:38:45.922]  I mean, war with the Russians building.
[02:38:45.922 --> 02:38:47.964]  Our government publicly funding Al Qaeda.
[02:38:48.962 --> 02:38:54.927]  And ISIS is just, it's just, robots replacing humans everywhere, all the announcements being made.
[02:38:54.927 --> 02:38:58.950]  It's Twilight Zone!
[02:38:58.950 --> 02:38:59.791]  It's Twilight Zone!
[02:39:02.383 --> 02:39:04.624]  But it's really happening.
[02:39:04.624 --> 02:39:06.626]  But I'm just too exhausted to do some big pitch.
[02:39:06.626 --> 02:39:10.528]  We've got amazing, known, concentrated organic herbs in the liver shield.
[02:39:10.528 --> 02:39:11.969]  TheInfoWarsLife.com.
[02:39:11.969 --> 02:39:15.071]  Most livers are toxic in this environment, even if you don't drink.
[02:39:15.071 --> 02:39:17.692]  And you can just take it daily, and it helps flush out your liver.
[02:39:17.692 --> 02:39:20.134]  And it really works, too.
[02:39:20.134 --> 02:39:21.735]  So don't drink if you're taking it.
[02:39:21.735 --> 02:39:30.480]  I'm just going to tell you right now, because if you drink when you take it... I mean, I was taking it and had one drink, and it hurt me.
[02:39:32.386 --> 02:39:37.949]  Okay, so you can take it on a daily basis, or you can do the super flush, which I've been doing.
[02:39:37.949 --> 02:39:45.552]  We take the Oxy Powder and the Liver Shield and the Organic Apple Cider Vinegar, and it just flushes everything out.
[02:39:45.552 --> 02:39:52.756]  And on the sixth day, you drink seven ounces of olive oil, lay on your right side, and it just releases in the morning for most people.
[02:39:52.756 --> 02:39:56.477]  Other people, it takes a few days, and the video's on InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:39:56.477 --> 02:40:00.079]  I'm not gonna describe it here, but the average person gets about 20, 30 balls the size of marbles.
[02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:02.300]  We're good to go.
[02:40:25.740 --> 02:40:28.983]  Physician, this is not your average vitamin or mineral.
[02:40:28.983 --> 02:40:30.664]  And we've got scores of other great products.
[02:40:30.664 --> 02:40:32.265]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:40:32.265 --> 02:40:34.127]  Your purchase funds this operation.
[02:40:34.127 --> 02:40:36.269]  And I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:40:36.269 --> 02:40:49.339]  Childress, I'm kind of just ranting here because before the shooting happened and all of this, the crescendo of shoes dropping, the buildup, the craziness of the power elite
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:57.448]  My spirit, my gut, whatever you call it, has never been wrong, and it is beyond upset, beyond having chills now.
[02:40:57.448 --> 02:41:03.815]  It is just a feeling of, not fear, it's more of just, ugh, I can't believe it.
[02:41:03.815 --> 02:41:07.178]  It's disbelief at the evil I feel entering the world.
[02:41:07.178 --> 02:41:07.899]  Does that make sense?
[02:41:09.080 --> 02:41:16.769]  Absolutely, I don't want to sound so much like a theologian, but I've been sharing the same message with my church.
[02:41:16.769 --> 02:41:23.056]  It's Isaiah 60, darkness covers the earth, gross darkness the people.
[02:41:23.056 --> 02:41:28.481]  Meaning the testimony of creation that there is a God is being hidden, darkness covers the earth.
[02:41:29.222 --> 02:41:37.086]  And there's a gross darkness on people that is basically anti-God, anti-family.
[02:41:37.086 --> 02:41:46.991]  Now, that is a great, you know, insight when you see how they're demeaning the first thing God started with when he wanted a family, which was a man.
[02:41:47.951 --> 02:41:50.073]  And they are trying to undermine that.
[02:41:50.073 --> 02:41:56.497]  If you undermine, and of course you also know we're going to have the ruling on same-sex marriage very shortly.
[02:41:56.497 --> 02:42:04.042]  If you can undermine the basic unit of family, you have no society and we will be controlled.
[02:42:04.042 --> 02:42:13.509]  We will be like drones because we will look to government for every decision we have to make because they will say we're too, we're not capable.
[02:42:13.789 --> 02:42:22.296]  Even here in the state of New Jersey, and I cannot understand how in the world we do not fight this more, but I got so many fights in me.
[02:42:22.296 --> 02:42:24.378]  We can't even have a referendum.
[02:42:24.378 --> 02:42:27.040]  We can't even put a question on the ballot.
[02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:28.501]  We the people.
[02:42:28.501 --> 02:42:35.007]  And our legislator, some time ago, decided that there'd be no referendums in New Jersey.
[02:42:36.448 --> 02:42:38.829]  This is where it's going.
[02:42:38.829 --> 02:42:41.730]  Now, what's going to stop that?
[02:42:41.730 --> 02:42:44.931]  All the time, you mentioned Dr. King, absolutely.
[02:42:44.931 --> 02:42:50.613]  He said, an injustice to anyone, anywhere is an injustice to everyone, everywhere.
[02:42:50.613 --> 02:43:04.198]  Until we get that mindset, that your struggle for justice is my struggle for justice, your desire to be free is my desire to be free, whether we be on the different sides of tracks, different cultures, different race,
[02:43:05.018 --> 02:43:07.860]  That's what will overcome the tyranny.
[02:43:07.860 --> 02:43:15.105]  That's what's going to overcome the hearts, basically, that are determined to control.
[02:43:15.105 --> 02:43:17.327]  This is all about control.
[02:43:17.327 --> 02:43:20.930]  The health care plan was not about health care.
[02:43:20.930 --> 02:43:22.371]  It was about control.
[02:43:22.371 --> 02:43:31.057]  Because if you can control that much of the economy and control that much of my decision making when it comes to my health, then you control me.
[02:43:31.517 --> 02:43:38.522]  So we're right now at a time where we must resist with everything that we have.
[02:43:38.522 --> 02:43:40.444]  And you can't fight every battle.
[02:43:40.444 --> 02:43:41.605]  Sometimes we may try to.
[02:43:41.605 --> 02:43:52.092]  We have to concentrate on where God is leading us to address, expose the evil, and do it in love, and unite people, and expose the darkness.
[02:43:52.092 --> 02:43:52.953]  You're absolutely right.
[02:43:52.953 --> 02:43:57.737]  Since I mentioned it, it's a couple minutes long, I want to play this Angel Soft toilet paper ad.
[02:43:58.783 --> 02:44:08.651]  Where they imply, because back during Mother's Day, every ad on the Super Bowl, there were six of them we played, every ad about Mother's Day said dads weren't needed, dads were bad.
[02:44:08.651 --> 02:44:21.442]  It was really vicious and nasty, as if you build women up by putting down dads, and then now, there's all these other anti-dad commercials, not just this one, where mom's the dad.
[02:44:21.442 --> 02:44:25.305]  As if it takes away from women to say there's a day for dads.
[02:44:26.932 --> 02:44:29.134]  It's just so obvious.
[02:44:29.134 --> 02:44:33.718]  Alex, there's nothing on the air that exalts a father.
[02:44:33.718 --> 02:44:35.600]  Look at all the sitcoms.
[02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:41.044]  It's either a woman, it's either a homosexual.
[02:44:41.044 --> 02:44:49.291]  There is no straight man that you could look to to honor as a person of wisdom, of stability, of fortitude.
[02:44:50.512 --> 02:44:58.654]  But they don't realize the days of Father's Nose Vest, the Donna Reed Show, Leave it to Beaver, all that, it's gone!
[02:44:58.654 --> 02:45:09.777]  And we have to understand that there's a theme that is being propagated to us that is literally destroying us and making us mindless.
[02:45:09.777 --> 02:45:11.318]  And with no stability.
[02:45:11.318 --> 02:45:13.278]  And that's the other part.
[02:45:13.278 --> 02:45:15.319]  You break down family, you don't have stability.
[02:45:15.839 --> 02:45:16.900]  I don't care who's the president.
[02:45:16.900 --> 02:45:31.410]  Well that was my point is that I can get the arguments we need more role models of women or I don't hate people over issues but they're pushing an agenda because behind it is the fall of civilization and we see the fruit coming out the other end.
[02:45:31.410 --> 02:45:32.130]  It's bad.
[02:45:32.130 --> 02:45:33.031]  It's poison.
[02:45:33.031 --> 02:45:35.613]  We know it's an evil plan.
[02:45:35.613 --> 02:45:37.454]  We know it's breaking down society.
[02:45:37.454 --> 02:45:38.435]  We know it's not good.
[02:45:38.435 --> 02:45:38.695]  In fact,
[02:45:39.235 --> 02:45:40.935]  Here is this ad, which is heartfelt.
[02:45:40.935 --> 02:45:42.376]  Of course moms are great.
[02:45:42.376 --> 02:45:44.956]  I watch this ad and think about all those hard-working moms.
[02:45:44.956 --> 02:45:46.797]  But this is Father's Day.
[02:45:46.797 --> 02:45:48.537]  See, you can't have a father.
[02:45:48.537 --> 02:45:49.477]  That's what they're saying.
[02:45:49.477 --> 02:45:51.298]  The father itself is bad.
[02:45:51.298 --> 02:46:00.019]  And I think about all the things my dad did, how great my grandfathers were, how good they were to everybody, and how we loved each other as families.
[02:46:00.019 --> 02:46:02.320]  And then nowadays, so many women I run into,
[02:46:03.240 --> 02:46:10.285]  They think a man being strong or a man being successful somehow diminishes them.
[02:46:10.285 --> 02:46:12.126]  It's so sick, don't they get?
[02:46:12.126 --> 02:46:14.328]  The government wants them alone.
[02:46:14.328 --> 02:46:17.030]  Women figure this out by about 40.
[02:46:17.030 --> 02:46:19.151]  But I tell you, they have really done a job.
[02:46:19.151 --> 02:46:21.373]  Let's go to this disgusting Angel Soft ad.
[02:46:21.373 --> 02:46:24.455]  They're airing all over the country right now and there's a big backlash to it.
[02:46:25.603 --> 02:46:29.246]  My father passed away when I was three.
[02:46:29.246 --> 02:46:32.549]  There was four of us kids within five years.
[02:46:32.549 --> 02:46:36.072]  So my mom had to raise four kids by herself.
[02:46:36.072 --> 02:46:42.478]  My mom was a single mother, so she raised both of us completely by herself.
[02:46:42.478 --> 02:46:51.346]  Which is... This is on Father's Day though, remember?
[02:46:51.346 --> 02:46:51.727]  I'm sorry.
[02:46:52.737 --> 02:46:54.638]  Again, to get in the middle of it, to act like they're against it.
[02:46:54.638 --> 02:46:59.459]  I don't know how she raised three boys on her own with such grace.
[02:46:59.459 --> 02:47:08.441]  I've definitely seen her try to juggle both mom, dad, and, you know, everything else that she had to be for herself.
[02:47:08.441 --> 02:47:09.742]  She did all of it.
[02:47:09.742 --> 02:47:12.902]  And she did it all as though she was two people.
[02:47:12.902 --> 02:47:13.563]  She was tough, huh?
[02:47:13.563 --> 02:47:14.043]  She was not a joke.
[02:47:14.043 --> 02:47:15.023]  Say, our car broke down.
[02:47:19.604 --> 02:47:21.585]  Um, oh, well, that's the alternator.
[02:47:21.585 --> 02:47:22.426]  They victimize you.
[02:47:22.426 --> 02:47:25.928]  She's like, you put your knuckle out and you just go for it.
[02:47:25.928 --> 02:47:27.869]  I mean, I don't even know if that's a thing.
[02:47:27.869 --> 02:47:28.609]  No, it's not.
[02:47:28.609 --> 02:47:35.693]  Even like, opposite of her toughness, it was something very fragile, you know?
[02:47:35.693 --> 02:47:42.697]  Anything that needs help, a person, a thing, an animal, she will find it and she will nurse it back to health.
[02:47:43.504 --> 02:47:49.609]  Notice all these men have imprinted on their mothers only, not on a father, so they're very effeminate.
[02:47:49.609 --> 02:47:52.771]  And again, that's so they don't know how to fight, don't know how to stand up.
[02:47:52.771 --> 02:47:54.312]  It's the nanny state.
[02:47:54.312 --> 02:47:56.033]  Phasing humans out.
[02:47:56.033 --> 02:48:00.496]  And then, they take it very aggressive that a man, if somebody else has a dad, that's bad.
[02:48:00.496 --> 02:48:00.957]  You understand?
[02:48:01.357 --> 02:48:03.578]  Because misery loves company.
[02:48:03.578 --> 02:48:08.501]  Anytime I promote a two-parent home, statistically much better, people go, why are you against single parents?
[02:48:08.501 --> 02:48:08.881]  I'm not.
[02:48:08.881 --> 02:48:10.382]  A lot of them do a great job.
[02:48:10.382 --> 02:48:12.623]  There's an agenda to break us up.
[02:48:12.623 --> 02:48:13.404]  That's the point.
[02:48:13.404 --> 02:48:16.185]  Let's go back to it.
[02:48:16.185 --> 02:48:17.466]  That's my mom.
[02:48:17.466 --> 02:48:21.028]  Always very affectionate, very hugging and kissing and all of that.
[02:48:21.028 --> 02:48:24.550]  It was always nothing but love.
[02:48:24.550 --> 02:48:27.371]  Some days she had to be softer.
[02:48:27.371 --> 02:48:28.492]  Some days she had to be stronger.
[02:48:29.992 --> 02:48:33.473]  She really is, like, the most amazing mother, but she was really an incredible father.
[02:48:33.473 --> 02:48:35.654]  Like, truly incredible.
[02:48:35.654 --> 02:48:37.855]  So, Cena, Father's Day has to be Mother's Day, too.
[02:48:37.855 --> 02:48:40.176]  But every day, she had to be both.
[02:48:40.176 --> 02:48:44.158]  Mom... I hope you have a beautiful day.
[02:48:44.158 --> 02:48:47.159]  This is your Father's Day.
[02:48:47.159 --> 02:48:50.160]  I love you from the bottom of my heart.
[02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:53.462]  And I'm thankful for everything you've done for me.
[02:48:53.462 --> 02:48:54.962]  She's done scientifically.
[02:48:54.962 --> 02:48:55.923]  These people don't know other things.
[02:48:55.923 --> 02:48:56.463]  Happy Father's Day, Mom.
[02:48:57.679 --> 02:48:59.760]  Happy Father's Day.
[02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:02.461]  Hi, Mom.
[02:49:02.461 --> 02:49:03.502]  Happy Father's Day.
[02:49:03.502 --> 02:49:05.423]  It's very subversive.
[02:49:05.423 --> 02:49:07.924]  Happy Father's Day, Mama.
[02:49:07.924 --> 02:49:10.665]  Happy Father's Day, Mom.
[02:49:10.665 --> 02:49:11.406]  Oh, Mom.
[02:49:11.406 --> 02:49:13.647]  But they'll know... Happy Father's Day.
[02:49:13.647 --> 02:49:20.350]  ...the big globalist company that women buy 83% of household items and almost 90% of paper goods.
[02:49:20.350 --> 02:49:21.571]  So it's a cold-blooded...
[02:49:23.098 --> 02:49:27.425]  Leftist agenda that wants to exterminate the babies, but notice it's incredibly unpopular.
[02:49:27.425 --> 02:49:28.507]  But they don't care.
[02:49:28.507 --> 02:49:32.593]  With the target audience, it'll make them buy more toilet paper.
[02:49:32.593 --> 02:49:34.736]  Reverend Childress, what do you think of that?
[02:49:34.736 --> 02:49:35.838]  That was sick.
[02:49:35.838 --> 02:49:36.839]  That was really sick.
[02:49:38.667 --> 02:49:50.551]  I, you know, well I'm glad of the dislikes, that's the encouraging part of it, but the fact of the matter is, there is a Mother's Day where you can say all those nice things.
[02:49:50.551 --> 02:49:56.053]  I mean, it is purposely and systemically an attack on the fathers.
[02:49:56.053 --> 02:50:02.795]  My goodness, and you're saying for profit, well then I can understand it, but... Every TV show, though, the father is a slob.
[02:50:02.795 --> 02:50:04.656]  Funny, the men I saw weren't like that.
[02:50:05.296 --> 02:50:09.198]  That's right, you're absolutely right, and I'm thanking God for it every day.
[02:50:09.198 --> 02:50:12.520]  You have to pick out your children's programs today.
[02:50:12.520 --> 02:50:17.143]  Parents, I'm telling you, you have to, you have to pick them out.
[02:50:17.143 --> 02:50:20.024]  Yes to this, no to that.
[02:50:20.024 --> 02:50:20.945]  My son-in-law,
[02:50:22.046 --> 02:50:22.486]  Uh, it
[02:50:42.583 --> 02:50:44.984]  Very much a part of our society today.
[02:50:44.984 --> 02:50:48.745]  And that's when it becomes intimidating and overwhelming.
[02:50:48.745 --> 02:50:52.266]  Well that's the issue is, I'll be quite frank with you, it makes me more reactionary.
[02:50:52.266 --> 02:50:57.708]  I've been pretty culturally liberal in many ways that I'm not obsessing over what people are doing.
[02:50:57.708 --> 02:51:01.309]  But at a certain point I get, wait a minute, they're obsessing over me.
[02:51:01.309 --> 02:51:06.231]  They're saying I can't go on being the way I am and I can't have my family.
[02:51:06.231 --> 02:51:09.952]  And everywhere they're trying to target my kids with stuff that's very subversive.
[02:51:10.552 --> 02:51:12.053]  I mean, it's tough for five-year-olds.
[02:51:12.053 --> 02:51:18.877]  Nickelodeon admitted four years ago that they were going to target four, five, and six-year-olds with a quote, you know, pro-gay agenda.
[02:51:18.877 --> 02:51:21.619]  Well, that's... What is sexualizing five-year-olds?
[02:51:22.182 --> 02:51:24.304]  They're doing a great job at it, too.
[02:51:24.304 --> 02:51:31.248]  And basically going unimpeded, without protests, without anyone saying, enough's enough.
[02:51:31.248 --> 02:51:32.789]  Same thing with Disneyland.
[02:51:32.789 --> 02:51:38.273]  I mean, you really, parents, unfortunately, this is the hour we're in, have to take a stand.
[02:51:38.273 --> 02:51:40.435]  And it is about profit for many of them.
[02:51:40.435 --> 02:51:42.916]  And if you hit them in their pocket, they will withdraw.
[02:51:42.916 --> 02:51:47.540]  It's just like with Duck Dynasty, when he made his comments.
[02:51:47.540 --> 02:51:50.522]  But then they looked at the checkbook and said, you know something, we're going to let this go.
[02:51:50.982 --> 02:52:01.186]  So we have to recognize we do still have buying power, and you can boycott these things effectively if you choose to do it.
[02:52:01.186 --> 02:52:02.766]  Generically, everybody.
[02:52:02.766 --> 02:52:16.671]  And I wanted to say to the audience also, this is the same issue with family that happened when our leadership, African American leadership, said in the 60s, well now we're going to get a piece of the pie.
[02:52:17.131 --> 02:52:18.952]  Whatever that meant.
[02:52:18.952 --> 02:52:25.397]  My mother and father didn't get a piece of the pie in that sense, but they had these great government programs, welfare programs.
[02:52:25.397 --> 02:52:34.183]  Well, I'm sure you remember part of that was the father could not be in the home in order for you to get the subsidy.
[02:52:34.183 --> 02:52:35.865]  The male cannot be there.
[02:52:36.565 --> 02:52:42.150]  Now, it's going national, it seems like, this same mentality.
[02:52:42.150 --> 02:52:43.511]  They say, you don't need a man.
[02:52:43.511 --> 02:52:48.075]  I mean, imagine saying to ducks, you don't need a male mate, or to eagles.
[02:52:48.075 --> 02:52:52.198]  I mean, it's just an attack on the species, like space aliens are running it or something.
[02:52:52.198 --> 02:53:00.145]  And we're like, look, the family's falling apart, stuff's disintegrating, and it's just like body snatchers or something.
[02:53:00.145 --> 02:53:01.466]  They go, you will be assimilated.
[02:53:02.691 --> 02:53:10.542]  Folks need to know that America is being destabilized and they can do something about it.
[02:53:10.542 --> 02:53:12.464]  They can't be intimidated about it.
[02:53:12.464 --> 02:53:20.275]  You can get frustrated about it like I do sometimes, but you have to have an agenda of your own and be strong and be faithful about your endeavor.
[02:53:20.895 --> 02:53:22.877]  And don't look back.
[02:53:22.877 --> 02:53:23.658]  That's what I found.
[02:53:23.658 --> 02:53:29.043]  If you tell children about the agenda and then they see it in their real life, then they don't rebel against you.
[02:53:29.043 --> 02:53:30.824]  They stand up against the system.
[02:53:30.824 --> 02:53:32.666]  People say, oh, the kids are all rebelling.
[02:53:32.666 --> 02:53:40.553]  Well, that's if you haven't laid out how the world works, then they're primed genetically to listen to their parents, especially their father.
[02:53:41.053 --> 02:53:55.203]  And that's why they don't want fathers there, so the fathers can sit around the campfire and tell the little braves what's coming up in the future, and then they go out and see it works, they respect their fathers, and not just their dad, but the other men in the tribe, and then that's how you have a strong tribe.
[02:53:55.203 --> 02:53:57.945]  You remove the men of the tribe, the tribe dies!
[02:53:57.945 --> 02:54:06.392]  How come the LBGT knows this, Planned Parenthood knows this, everybody that's our enemies knows they have to get to our children?
[02:54:07.112 --> 02:54:16.396]  And it appears that we don't offer enough defense for our children to guard them against the lies, guard them against this intrusion.
[02:54:16.396 --> 02:54:35.883]  And when you have the President of the United States pushing this filth, basically, or this sexualization of our children, even down to kindergarten by these health programs or these health studies in our school, it is time for us to stand up.
[02:54:36.203 --> 02:54:38.485]  There has to be a degree of revolt.
[02:54:38.485 --> 02:54:39.305]  That's what I was going to ask.
[02:54:39.305 --> 02:54:40.406]  What is the bottom?
[02:54:40.406 --> 02:54:41.587]  How much are we going to put up with?
[02:54:41.587 --> 02:54:50.993]  I mean, they know we won't put up with forever, so they want to have the revolution just be a big race war instead of people coming together and vomiting out this sick culture they're force-feeding us.
[02:54:50.993 --> 02:54:54.036]  Yeah, well, it's coming to a head now, Alex.
[02:54:54.036 --> 02:54:59.820]  I really, it's, you know, civil disobedience is fine.
[02:54:59.820 --> 02:55:05.764]  When you're trying to really show forth your effort, I believe, to be peaceful, Martin
[02:55:06.264 --> 02:55:07.366]  Do it in peace.
[02:55:07.366 --> 02:55:10.550]  And I believe he showed the world that they could be done that way.
[02:55:10.550 --> 02:55:15.857]  But we need to say no, we're not going to allow our kids to go to those schools that are teaching this.
[02:55:15.857 --> 02:55:22.246]  No, we're not going to permit this intrusion in our own businesses when it comes to our faith and our religion.
[02:55:22.546 --> 02:55:23.806]  Just no!
[02:55:23.806 --> 02:55:50.754]  And they can't handle that type of revolt, and I believe when one day, especially the African American community especially, will stop bowing down to the politicians who mean them absolutely no good at all, and really recognize that they have stripped them of their faith, stripped them of their belief, stripped them of their morality, then there will be a shift then.
[02:55:51.074 --> 02:55:52.255]  There will be a shift then.
[02:55:52.255 --> 02:55:56.317]  I think it is, once again, the church is the key.
[02:55:56.317 --> 02:55:57.998]  We meet every Sunday.
[02:55:57.998 --> 02:55:59.919]  It can gradually be done and changed.
[02:55:59.919 --> 02:56:01.760]  The information has to get in.
[02:56:01.760 --> 02:56:11.366]  We can't just come in with sermons that are religious, but we have to come in with a word based from the scriptures to bring about change in our presence.
[02:56:11.366 --> 02:56:16.729]  Well, it's all interconnected, and that's what founded this country, was the pastors saying no to the tyranny.
[02:56:16.729 --> 02:56:19.511]  In closing, you've been monitoring media, obviously, as I have.
[02:56:20.784 --> 02:56:30.529]  They're going with the anti-gun agenda, but do you think cooler heads will prevail, and we're not going to put up with hyping a race war like the media has been trying to do?
[02:56:30.529 --> 02:56:33.770]  So far, how bad does it look?
[02:56:33.770 --> 02:56:35.851]  So, you know, I can't tell right now.
[02:56:35.851 --> 02:56:38.613]  I'm going to wait until after this weekend.
[02:56:38.613 --> 02:56:46.476]  As I stated, there's going to be some militant speakers that I don't know what they're going to do with this right now.
[02:56:46.476 --> 02:56:47.257]  You'll know Monday.
[02:56:48.069 --> 02:56:50.670]  Yeah, I'll get a better feel for Monday or Tuesday.
[02:56:50.670 --> 02:56:55.772]  And I think, once again, the timing on this was impeccable.
[02:56:55.772 --> 02:57:07.797]  And so now you've given talking points to some of the most militant, rebellious individuals, especially in the African American community, who would really, some of them would want a race war.
[02:57:07.797 --> 02:57:10.619]  They want this anarchy.
[02:57:10.619 --> 02:57:11.159]  Insanity.
[02:57:11.899 --> 02:57:12.760]  Uh, to continue.
[02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:15.704]  So I'll know better after this weekend.
[02:57:15.704 --> 02:57:23.172]  And, um, prayerfully the people of, uh, Charleston respond prayerfully and we'll see.
[02:57:23.172 --> 02:57:24.053]  I can't tell right now.
[02:57:24.053 --> 02:57:25.514]  Blackgenocide.org.
[02:57:25.514 --> 02:57:26.595]  Reverend Clennard Childress.
[02:57:26.595 --> 02:57:27.196]  God bless you.
[02:57:27.196 --> 02:57:30.400]  Hopefully you can pop in with us at least 30 minutes sometime next week with an update.
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:31.160]  Have a great weekend, sir.
[02:57:31.681 --> 02:57:32.362]  Appreciate it.
[02:57:32.362 --> 02:57:33.082]  God bless now.
[02:57:33.082 --> 02:57:33.623]  God bless you.
[02:57:33.623 --> 02:57:34.604]  I tell you folks.
[02:57:34.604 --> 02:57:40.689]  And again, it's not that I hate anybody for who they are, what they're... I'm very open-minded, classical liberal.
[02:57:40.689 --> 02:57:42.210]  But there is an agenda.
[02:57:42.210 --> 02:57:43.752]  Just look at it.
[02:57:43.752 --> 02:57:46.194]  It's not good.
[02:57:46.194 --> 02:57:48.516]  Everything attached to it is to bring down humanity.
[02:57:50.239 --> 02:57:53.201]  If I was going to take down any group, I'd go in and take the men out.
[02:57:53.201 --> 02:57:54.842]  That's what every enslaving group did.
[02:57:54.842 --> 02:57:57.584]  I mean, it is one-on-one takeover.
[02:57:57.584 --> 02:57:58.605]  I don't mean to do this every day.
[02:57:58.605 --> 02:57:59.405]  I've got to do some overdrive.
[02:57:59.405 --> 02:58:04.209]  There's a breaking news at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:58:04.209 --> 02:58:07.431]  China to retrofit thousands of merchant ships for war.
[02:58:07.431 --> 02:58:08.151]  That's what I mean.
[02:58:08.151 --> 02:58:08.892]  I mean, it's like...
[02:58:10.293 --> 02:58:13.257]  Top historians are saying this is like pre-World War I, pre-World War II.
[02:58:13.257 --> 02:58:20.426]  I mean, everybody who's smart is saying, man, the elite have decided to just do some crazy stuff.
[02:58:20.426 --> 02:58:22.749]  I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., okay?
[02:58:22.749 --> 02:58:23.730]  Lord willing, pray for us.
[02:58:23.730 --> 02:58:24.451]  4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:24.451 --> 02:58:25.212]  on the Sunday show.
[02:58:25.212 --> 02:58:25.932]  Tell friends and family.
[02:58:30.359 --> 02:58:51.013]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[02:58:51.013 --> 02:58:51.433]  Well then,
[02:58:51.773 --> 02:58:55.818]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[02:58:55.818 --> 02:58:57.380]  Hdfirearms.com.
[02:58:57.380 --> 02:59:05.809]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people, they're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[02:59:05.809 --> 02:59:06.530]  It's always about
[02:59:06.630 --> 02:59:07.050]  I think so.
[02:59:33.746 --> 02:59:43.996]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:43.996 --> 02:59:50.622]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:59:50.622 --> 02:59:53.605]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:59:54.790 --> 02:59:59.574]  By the way, I forgot to play this Ron Paul clip, so I'll play it now, then I'll hit this merchant story.
[02:59:59.574 --> 03:00:02.636]  Shining a retrofit thousands of merchant ships for war.
[03:00:02.636 --> 03:00:10.442]  Here is that clip, ominous clip, the full video is up on InfoWars.com with former Congressman Ron Paul talking about the Day of Reckoning.
[03:00:11.118 --> 03:00:13.020]  Well, you don't know the timeline on this.
[03:00:13.020 --> 03:00:21.850]  It could be tomorrow, it could be a month, it could be a couple years from now, because it all depends on a psychological acceptance of the system.
[03:00:21.850 --> 03:00:30.400]  So a lot of people who are still making a lot of money know the system is not going to last, but they figure, well, if everybody else thinks it's going to last, then just keep...
[03:00:30.680 --> 03:00:31.020]  I don't know.
[03:00:48.476 --> 03:00:55.159]  Believe me, they cannot reverse history, and you cannot print money forever and deceive the markets forever.
[03:00:55.159 --> 03:01:00.702]  Eventually, the markets will rule, and that's only a question of when that will happen.
[03:01:00.702 --> 03:01:06.164]  And, of course, I run a little bit scared, because I think there will be a day of reckoning.
[03:01:06.164 --> 03:01:07.625]  Powerful transmission.
[03:01:07.625 --> 03:01:10.427]  Bolivia on Infowars.com.
[03:01:10.427 --> 03:01:13.968]  China to retrofit thousands of merchant ships for war.
[03:01:13.968 --> 03:01:16.910]  Beijing launches huge program as tensions with the U.S.
[03:01:16.910 --> 03:01:17.190]  build.
[03:01:18.482 --> 03:01:23.906]  China is set to retrofit thousands of merchant ships for military purposes so they can be used in the event of war.
[03:01:23.906 --> 03:01:29.110]  Another disturbing indication of growing tensions between Beijing and Washington.
[03:01:29.110 --> 03:01:36.835]  Shipping industry publication Trade Winds reveals that China is preparing a new fleet of war-ready ships to serve as a reserve military logistics wing.
[03:01:36.835 --> 03:01:38.937]  That's just their regular ships, so they're covert.
[03:01:38.937 --> 03:01:43.080]  In the event of a naval conflict, the new policy will apply to container ships
[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:56.430]  Roros, multipurpose ships, bulkers and other ships with shipbuilders receiving a government subsidy to pay for the cost of making the vessels military useful.
[03:01:56.430 --> 03:02:07.600]  And now they're announcing here in the United States they're putting cruise missile, anti-cruise missile batteries on the east and west coast to shoot down submarine-launched cruise missiles.
[03:02:07.600 --> 03:02:11.283]  I mean, regardless, it's a giant boondoggle ripping us off, but it looks
[03:02:12.464 --> 03:02:16.449]  Really ominous, with the whole Russia situation and the rest of it.
[03:02:16.449 --> 03:02:25.921]  According to American Maritime Congress President James Capote, the move is another sign of Beijing intensifying its military buildup while Washington stands idly by.
[03:02:25.921 --> 03:02:28.464]  We really want China to do that much more capable, he asked?
[03:02:29.321 --> 03:02:46.326]  Explaining the decision to retrofit merchant ships with military technology, People's Liberation Army researcher Chao-Lin Dong said, modern naval warfare often requires the mobilization and deployment of a larger number of ships, while the mass production of naval ships in peacetime is not economically sensible.
[03:02:46.326 --> 03:02:47.886]  That's what England and the U.S.
[03:02:47.886 --> 03:02:53.568]  both did in World War I and World War II, and in a bunch of other conflicts.
[03:02:53.568 --> 03:02:55.969]  And what it is, is it's covert, where you can have missiles,
[03:02:57.630 --> 03:02:57.810]  It's
[03:03:14.741 --> 03:03:17.482]  Uh, and then you just have the companies do it, and then you pay them back.
[03:03:17.482 --> 03:03:21.543]  I mean, there's hundreds of things they're doing, and they've got all these ports everywhere.
[03:03:21.543 --> 03:03:24.084]  They've got Long Beach, all the other deep water parts.
[03:03:24.084 --> 03:03:25.244]  It's crazy.
[03:03:25.244 --> 03:03:33.227]  Panama Canal, and we're being set up, as Joel Skousen has said, for a conflict to entice Russia and China to strike.
[03:03:33.227 --> 03:03:39.648]  They're just pushing them and pushing them, while the elite creep over and stand right next to their bunkers, waiting for whatever this is.
[03:03:39.648 --> 03:03:41.569]  I mean, we're in the hands of suicidal nutcases.
[03:03:44.690 --> 03:03:45.531]  That's all I can say.
[03:03:45.531 --> 03:03:49.553]  I mean, just look at the news.
[03:03:49.553 --> 03:03:51.595]  There's just hundreds of these, or hundreds of them.
[03:03:51.595 --> 03:03:55.197]  School lunch program scans students' thumbprints for tracking purposes.
[03:03:55.197 --> 03:03:57.319]  No, it's a condition to do that to buy and sell.
[03:03:57.319 --> 03:04:03.964]  Brian Williams gets $10 million for his new job at MSNBC.
[03:04:03.964 --> 03:04:05.725]  He'll fit in really well with that scum.
[03:04:05.725 --> 03:04:08.026]  I mean, they are just scum.
[03:04:08.026 --> 03:04:08.467]  Lying.
[03:04:08.467 --> 03:04:13.610]  I never... Let's go out with Melissa Harris Perry saying that your kids belong to them.
[03:04:14.648 --> 03:04:18.029]  And just remember that, because they know best.
[03:04:18.029 --> 03:04:20.931]  Your kids belong to this White House operative, this creepy woman.
[03:04:20.931 --> 03:04:23.492]  And I'll see you back, Lord Willing, this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:04:23.492 --> 03:04:24.832]  Great job, crew.
[03:04:24.832 --> 03:04:28.094]  We haven't had a very collective notion of these are our children.
[03:04:28.094 --> 03:04:36.637]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[03:04:36.637 --> 03:04:41.560]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making better investments.
