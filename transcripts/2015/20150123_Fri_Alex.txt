[00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:00.332]  The show.
[00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:20.270]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:21.731]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.511 --> 00:00:23.411]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.051 --> 00:00:27.672]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.252 --> 00:00:32.293]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.503 --> 00:00:47.805]  Hard to believe it's already Friday, the 23rd day of January 2015.
[00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:51.066]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.387]  We'll be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:54.647 --> 00:01:02.510]  We don't have any guests today because it's Open Line Friday, the customary tradition of Talk Radio that we occasionally follow.
[00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:11.473]  So we will have open phones today, wide open phones, first-time callers, long-time callers, people that agree, disagree, free for all, any subjects you want to raise.
[00:01:12.423 --> 00:01:18.166]  We've got questions, comments, whatever the case is, the phones will be open throughout the transmission today.
[00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:19.967]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:01:19.987 --> 00:01:20.027]  800-259-9231.
[00:01:20.047 --> 00:01:22.188]  Where to begin with all of this wild news that we have here?
[00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:37.779]  Billionaire lecture surfs in Davos.
[00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.481]  Quote, Americans lifestyle expectations are far too high.
[00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:48.703]  Harvard professor at Davos says government mosquito drones will extract your DNA.
[00:01:49.084 --> 00:01:50.384]  Quote, privacy is dead.
[00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:52.245]  Academic tells Davos, elight.
[00:01:54.918 --> 00:01:58.022]  Infowars.com story that's on DrudgeReport.com right now.
[00:01:58.162 --> 00:02:01.727]  Bill Gates pushes Cashless Society at Davos.
[00:02:02.068 --> 00:02:04.050]  That little stack all ties together.
[00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:05.673]  We're going to be getting to that.
[00:02:06.454 --> 00:02:09.277]  Man threatened with six months in jail sentence for owning a windmill.
[00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:15.311]  That ties into all these other reports.
[00:02:15.932 --> 00:02:20.534]  State of Mississippi wants to punish an 88-year-old doctor for treating the poor out of his car.
[00:02:21.255 --> 00:02:23.656]  Boston City employees barred from hating on Olympics.
[00:02:24.016 --> 00:02:26.958]  Mayor sees free speech still an act.
[00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:30.560]  Mayor attempts to silence dissent with authoritarian decree.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.182]  That's just some of the news.
[00:02:34.302 --> 00:02:36.924]  Bombings kill 14 soldiers, militiamen in Iraq.
[00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:39.360]  That ties into U.S.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.643]  trainers to deploy along with armored vehicles to Ukraine to back up Ukrainian government against the Russkies.
[00:02:45.304 --> 00:02:45.564]  U.S.
[00:02:45.584 --> 00:02:47.545]  fears chaos as government of Yemen falls.
[00:02:48.106 --> 00:02:48.346]  U.S.
[00:02:48.386 --> 00:02:51.368]  and Iraq planning strike to reclaim Mosul from Islamic State.
[00:02:51.388 --> 00:02:57.932]  It's always good to turn your phone off when you get ready to go live on air.
[00:02:58.613 --> 00:02:58.933]  Alex.
[00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:01.915]  Lecturing myself here.
[00:03:03.154 --> 00:03:06.676]  With oligarch justice, powerful pedophiles roam free.
[00:03:07.257 --> 00:03:17.664]  As Barrett Brown returns to jail, he was given 60 plus months in prison for reporting on WikiLeaks, basically.
[00:03:19.105 --> 00:03:22.968]  Under Obama, we have never since the time of Lincoln
[00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:36.146]  seen such a war on the press and by and large mainstream media is still completely sycophantic and lapdog towards Barack Obama.
[00:03:37.327 --> 00:03:38.768]  You can say well Barack Obama's a puppet.
[00:03:38.828 --> 00:03:44.833]  Well regardless he's the quote commander-in-chief and the guy is dismantling what was left of the country.
[00:03:45.993 --> 00:03:54.840]  And then God help us when the Republicans put in Jeb Bush or Chris Christie or somebody they're just going to grease the skids even more.
[00:03:58.058 --> 00:04:06.163]  Speaking of police state, I see so many horrible things police are doing around the country that it makes me cringe.
[00:04:07.124 --> 00:04:09.906]  I don't sit there and go, oh, goody, goody, gumdrop.
[00:04:10.947 --> 00:04:13.268]  I've got something that really makes the police look bad.
[00:04:16.671 --> 00:04:19.993]  Quite frankly, 15, 20 years ago, I did kind of behave like that.
[00:04:21.834 --> 00:04:24.957]  And the reason I talk so much about this is it's the key to everything.
[00:04:25.457 --> 00:04:33.425]  If the public can understand this, if the police can understand this, if I can articulate it, we can wrap our mind around it, a lot of folks do understand it.
[00:04:34.306 --> 00:04:40.031]  But if we can communicate this message, I'm telling you, it could bring down the corrupt system and restore the republic to a great extent.
[00:04:40.491 --> 00:04:46.177]  Doesn't mean we'll be in some panacea utopia, but
[00:04:49.076 --> 00:04:57.325]  I got footage of this UFC fighter pulled over and tased for asking the cops for ID.
[00:04:57.786 --> 00:04:58.847]  But that's not even the issue.
[00:04:58.887 --> 00:05:02.251]  They charge him with assaulting the police and it's all on video.
[00:05:02.271 --> 00:05:02.951]  He didn't touch him.
[00:05:04.553 --> 00:05:07.596]  And in this is the essence of what will make this country collapse.
[00:05:10.071 --> 00:05:13.913]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[00:05:14.673 --> 00:05:20.916]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[00:05:21.036 --> 00:05:30.079]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.282]  Supercharge and conquer your world at InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:40.097 --> 00:05:43.599]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:47.722]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:48.042 --> 00:05:49.503]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:49.823 --> 00:05:57.408]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:57.688 --> 00:05:58.529]  But for how long?
[00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:05.093]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:06:05.473 --> 00:06:08.275]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:06:09.947 --> 00:06:12.369]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:13.590]  Check it out today.
[00:06:14.071 --> 00:06:19.696]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore, cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none.
[00:06:19.816 --> 00:06:22.258]  And that's what you'll find at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:29.525]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[00:06:29.605 --> 00:06:30.225]  We're good to go.
[00:06:50.373 --> 00:06:50.914]  We're good.
[00:07:09.778 --> 00:07:18.482]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[00:07:18.782 --> 00:07:28.747]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[00:07:29.307 --> 00:07:35.415]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:07:35.735 --> 00:07:41.903]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:07:42.143 --> 00:07:45.327]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections and
[00:07:45.607 --> 00:07:50.329]  Adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:53.510]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:07:53.811 --> 00:07:54.971]  No needles, no injections.
[00:07:55.351 --> 00:07:56.632]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:07:56.732 --> 00:07:57.652]  Try it for yourself.
[00:07:57.932 --> 00:07:59.593]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.
[00:08:00.353 --> 00:08:02.414]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.
[00:08:02.694 --> 00:08:06.556]  Secure yours today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:08:10.182 --> 00:08:10.743]  We've got it.
[00:08:10.783 --> 00:08:17.228]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:08:17.308 --> 00:08:19.390]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:21.692 --> 00:08:27.338]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:47.234 --> 00:08:54.760]  I've been wanting to talk about this for a long time, but we've got this headline out today, out of the Times of Israel.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.483]  Netanyahu spat in our face, White House official says.
[00:08:59.503 --> 00:09:04.706]  And it just goes into how horrible Benjamin Netanyahu is, according to the White House.
[00:09:06.628 --> 00:09:10.591]  And there's all these moves in Israel to basically indict Netanyahu right now.
[00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:13.673]  Whether you love Benjamin Netanyahu or hate him,
[00:09:14.741 --> 00:09:19.223]  There's major political realignment happening all over the world.
[00:09:19.323 --> 00:09:22.985]  So there are some power structure shifts beneath the surface.
[00:09:23.085 --> 00:09:32.650]  But the last few years, this tiff between Israel and the Likudniks and the United States is total fantasy land.
[00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:36.472]  Now there are battles over who runs things.
[00:09:36.512 --> 00:09:37.453]  That's always going on.
[00:09:37.933 --> 00:09:38.633]  Power struggles.
[00:09:38.693 --> 00:09:41.035]  But the overall agenda
[00:09:41.906 --> 00:09:49.192]  To turn radical Islamists loose all over the Middle East and destabilize the region is bipartisan, Republican and Democrat.
[00:09:49.232 --> 00:09:54.556]  It's bipartisan in Israel, between the Likudniks and Labor and others in the Knesset.
[00:09:58.739 --> 00:10:01.341]  And Saudi Arabia and Israel are in a lip lock.
[00:10:02.578 --> 00:10:08.099]  And Israel and the Golan Heights has been backing the Syrian, Free Syrian Army for the last three, four years.
[00:10:08.599 --> 00:10:12.380]  So Israel's involved in all of this and it's just a fact.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.880]  And it's not a defense of Israel.
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.361]  It's not an attack of Israel.
[00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:18.201]  Everybody's got this hot button issue of one side or the other.
[00:10:18.861 --> 00:10:27.443]  I'm saying it's immoral and evil for Turkey, for Saudi Arabia, for the United States, for France, for England, for Germany, for NATO, for Interpol.
[00:10:28.376 --> 00:10:39.985]  For the Pentagon to be supporting the Syrian rebels, who have been and are 95% Al-Qaeda, no matter what name they give it to confuse the public.
[00:10:42.603 --> 00:10:45.044]  And even the Iraqi government has caught the U.S.
[00:10:45.164 --> 00:10:49.985]  dropping air shipments of weapons to Al-Qaeda hundreds of times, and they keep saying it's an accident.
[00:10:50.565 --> 00:10:51.505]  No, it's not an accident.
[00:10:51.565 --> 00:10:58.366]  And the military knows that since they refused to go to the air bases and give them the weapons, they're ordered to just airdrop at coordinates now.
[00:10:59.626 --> 00:11:01.627]  And I'm getting that back from sources as well.
[00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:05.648]  You've heard some of them here on air that are current CIA pilots flying weapons.
[00:11:06.588 --> 00:11:08.248]  And you ask, how on earth could they come on air?
[00:11:08.268 --> 00:11:11.909]  Because there's White Hat, Black Hat, and the White Hats are protected to a certain extent.
[00:11:12.697 --> 00:11:13.838]  About Tosh Plumlee and others.
[00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:17.943]  Still flying weapons today to the Middle East.
[00:11:18.724 --> 00:11:26.732]  He's interviewed us twice when he's on the tarmac about to lead a whole group of C-130s from Texas to the Middle East loaded with weapons.
[00:11:28.714 --> 00:11:31.137]  He's done the interviews from the cockpit.
[00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:38.337]  And you've seen all these generals and people come out and say they don't want to back Al-Qaeda.
[00:11:38.557 --> 00:11:43.839]  You saw Dempsey three months ago say that in a Congressional Armed Services Senate Committee hearing.
[00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:45.360]  We played the clip probably ten times.
[00:11:47.381 --> 00:11:50.422]  Lindsey Graham, people are saying, we're not involved with Al-Qaeda, right, right?
[00:11:50.782 --> 00:11:51.622]  None of our allies are.
[00:11:51.642 --> 00:11:52.663]  And he goes, yeah, of course they are.
[00:11:52.703 --> 00:11:53.403]  They're all backing them.
[00:11:54.514 --> 00:12:01.077]  And Dempsey just actually turns his hands up and goes with the international gesture of like, why are you feeding this bull?
[00:12:01.478 --> 00:12:06.160]  I'm not going to sit here and lie under oath for you, Graham.
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:12.623]  And Graham looks scared because let me tell you, this is a real come to Jesus moment that's been going on for two years in the U.S.
[00:12:12.663 --> 00:12:19.307]  military because they know we're back in the worst of the worst over there and they don't sleep good at night thinking about that.
[00:12:19.895 --> 00:12:29.219]  They've done a lot of really hardcore stuff in their careers, and they don't like doing something purely openly evil, where there's no debating it's bad.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.602]  For all this Machiavellian mumbo-jumbo about it justifies the means.
[00:12:35.902 --> 00:12:45.647]  Really, the end is to remove Assad and a government that was democratizing, where women can go to college, and where Christians and Jews can live in peace, to turn it over to a bunch of people to
[00:12:46.946 --> 00:12:53.070]  Kill hundreds of thousands and blow up every church they find and chop Catholic priests' heads off on television and eat hearts?
[00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.912]  There is no debating it!
[00:12:55.932 --> 00:13:03.377]  I mean, one thing if they used evil groups to overthrow somebody evil and then took them out, that'd be bad enough.
[00:13:03.397 --> 00:13:06.539]  Because any time you use evil to fight evil, you turn out
[00:13:07.403 --> 00:13:08.483]  Getting something worse in the end.
[00:13:08.503 --> 00:13:11.644]  That's just the metaphysical law, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:12.064 --> 00:13:14.305]  I use the allegory of the Ring of Mordor.
[00:13:14.665 --> 00:13:15.885]  The Ring of Power.
[00:13:16.626 --> 00:13:20.227]  One ring to rule them all, and in the darkness bind them.
[00:13:23.087 --> 00:13:24.908]  But all of them were deceived.
[00:13:25.968 --> 00:13:29.469]  For in the darkness of Mount Doom, one ring was forged.
[00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.290]  And in it, his hatred and malice was placed.
[00:13:34.991 --> 00:13:35.411]  One ring,
[00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:41.855]  To find them one ring, to rule them all one ring, in the darkness bind them.
[00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:46.979]  And by the way, that is what the internet was designed to do.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.702]  That's why it was rolled out.
[00:13:51.323 --> 00:13:52.704]  It is the thing of internets.
[00:13:53.325 --> 00:13:55.147]  It is the thing of the internet.
[00:13:55.647 --> 00:13:57.168]  Not trying to channel George W. Bush.
[00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:59.631]  Or Rick Perry, start calling it tweeters.
[00:14:01.044 --> 00:14:10.372]  It is the smart dust, it is the RFIDs, it is the grid that will interface and surveil everything and then predict the future and then control the future.
[00:14:10.873 --> 00:14:23.323]  In Google's own words from 14 years ago, at publicly declassified DARPA meetings, you can pull this up, just type in Google plan to create AI.
[00:14:25.253 --> 00:14:30.414]  Google's master plan was to create AI that could see the future.
[00:14:31.454 --> 00:14:35.115]  Google is a governmental corporate merger strategy system.
[00:14:36.915 --> 00:14:44.077]  I saw the cover of the Chronicle this week and it was like, can Google save Austin and bridge the gap and bring us internet we need?
[00:14:44.337 --> 00:14:45.617]  Oh, save us.
[00:14:46.957 --> 00:14:48.077]  There it is, Wired Magazine.
[00:14:48.477 --> 00:14:50.878]  Google's grand plan to make your brain irrelevant.
[00:14:52.102 --> 00:14:55.163]  It is already artificially intelligent in 2014.
[00:14:55.704 --> 00:14:58.425]  They admitted they'd already achieved it for all intents and purposes.
[00:14:58.785 --> 00:15:17.433]  It interfaces with you creating a giant brain with all of the billions of synapses that are represented by billions of people interfacing with their hopes, their dreams, their subconscious algorithms and archetypes are then manifest in giant three-dimensional
[00:15:21.923 --> 00:15:22.383]  Models.
[00:15:25.545 --> 00:15:36.511]  Huge Roischauer patterns that can then be used to predict the future 100% in human activity.
[00:15:37.511 --> 00:15:42.654]  You can't predict the future with asteroids and comets and earthquakes, but they're getting better and better with computers.
[00:15:43.814 --> 00:15:48.457]  The three breakthroughs, they have finally unleashed AI on the world.
[00:15:48.477 --> 00:15:48.457]  10, 27, 14.
[00:15:52.537 --> 00:16:06.190]  Wired Magazine yet again, and it goes back in the article to the beginning of Google back in 1999 saying, we're not building a search engine, because they had big investors saying, who needs another search engine?
[00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:08.953]  They said, we're building an AI that will control everything.
[00:16:09.814 --> 00:16:10.815]  And they're doing it!
[00:16:16.354 --> 00:16:20.578]  I was not the only avid user on its search site who thought it would not last long.
[00:16:20.999 --> 00:16:25.403]  But Page Reply had always struck me and stuck with me.
[00:16:25.983 --> 00:16:27.685]  Oh, we're really making an AI.
[00:16:28.806 --> 00:16:31.329]  Then they go into the AI takeover grid.
[00:16:34.412 --> 00:16:36.654]  Before this information was even public,
[00:16:41.283 --> 00:16:47.467]  I was aware of mathematical equations from the 30s that Isaac Asimov picked up on and then wrote the foundation series out of.
[00:16:48.067 --> 00:16:54.951]  So he didn't really invent the idea, he invented the term robot, but he didn't invent the idea of mathematics to predict the future.
[00:17:02.133 --> 00:17:02.973]  And they're now doing it.
[00:17:03.513 --> 00:17:05.814]  And they can now game basically everything.
[00:17:06.334 --> 00:17:08.055]  Do we have free will?
[00:17:08.575 --> 00:17:15.437]  Will we unhook ourselves from the iPhones, the iPads, the droids, the TV, the ESPN, or is it really over?
[00:17:16.617 --> 00:17:18.298]  Are we going to give up on our consciousness?
[00:17:18.878 --> 00:17:21.479]  Are we going to let the establishment direct human development?
[00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:23.099]  Because here's the deal.
[00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:28.941]  The human development they're directing us into is the end of humanity as we know it.
[00:17:31.007 --> 00:17:34.231]  And they've convinced people in their decadence not to care to think it's cute and funny.
[00:17:34.631 --> 00:17:39.377]  Even those that are awake now, many of them will say, okay, you're right about all this, but so what?
[00:17:39.457 --> 00:17:40.518]  I'm just gonna have a good time.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.826]  But then those are incredibly empty and unhappy people when you get down to the bottom line.
[00:17:49.149 --> 00:17:50.050]  You're not meant
[00:17:51.687 --> 00:18:06.797]  To be like a person in a digital cage who all the stimulus is fed to you and then you don't experience true reality or spirituality, you end up experiencing the false universe fed to you by the control grid.
[00:18:08.998 --> 00:18:16.583]  Here is Google's Schmidt and the Hollywood Reporter.
[00:18:18.359 --> 00:18:22.005]  Google Chairman Eric Schmidt at Davos, the Internet will disappear.
[00:18:22.085 --> 00:18:34.083]  He also discussed online dominance of the World Economic Forum panel, Facebook, COO Sheryl Sandberg, and while Yahoo's CEO is asked about privacy issues.
[00:18:36.693 --> 00:18:44.116]  At the end of the panel on World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where his comments were webcast, he was asked if his prediction on the future of the web.
[00:18:44.536 --> 00:18:47.698]  I will answer very simply, the internet will disappear, Schmitt said.
[00:18:48.058 --> 00:18:55.581]  There will be so many IPs, so many devices, sensors, things that you're wearing, things that you are interacting with that you won't even sense it, he explained.
[00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:57.722]  It will be part of your presence all the time.
[00:18:58.182 --> 00:18:59.542]  See, it's a cloak, a matrix.
[00:19:00.183 --> 00:19:03.024]  Imagine you walk into a room and the room is dynamic.
[00:19:03.624 --> 00:19:08.387]  And with your permission, and all of that, you are interacting with the things going on in the room.
[00:19:08.687 --> 00:19:10.148]  No, it's not with the permission.
[00:19:12.129 --> 00:19:19.893]  Google's been caught for at least 10 years driving around with their Google car, stealing your passwords and data with NSA authorization as an NSA node.
[00:19:26.537 --> 00:19:27.378]  With your permission.
[00:19:28.564 --> 00:19:38.857]  Did they tell you that globally they got international laws passed to make us go to the new light bulbs because they can be accessed by data down power line and then interfaced with all the new devices in your house?
[00:19:39.118 --> 00:19:39.979]  No, they didn't tell you that.
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:41.301]  Now they are!
[00:19:42.588 --> 00:19:45.449]  And they're rolling it out that, oh, the new TVs interact with your appliances.
[00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:47.070]  And you can turn it off if you want.
[00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:51.252]  It's kind of hard to do in the settings, but, you know, like, like, like, close encounters of the third kind.
[00:19:51.933 --> 00:19:53.613]  Toys and stuff will start turning on and off.
[00:19:53.673 --> 00:19:54.554]  Lights will flash.
[00:19:55.014 --> 00:19:55.915]  You know, things will go on.
[00:19:55.935 --> 00:19:56.635]  It's just kind of neat.
[00:19:56.755 --> 00:19:57.735]  Oh, doesn't that sound wonderful?
[00:19:58.016 --> 00:19:59.896]  You have all these little robots running things.
[00:20:00.457 --> 00:20:05.579]  Except then you realize the globalists are hell-bent on murdering every single one of us.
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.761]  Merging with machines and flying off to Alpha Centauri.
[00:20:10.034 --> 00:20:13.415]  Worried about getting sick and feeling terrible for days or even weeks?
[00:20:13.695 --> 00:20:16.235]  You need Imudine for a healthy immune system.
[00:20:16.555 --> 00:20:19.496]  Why get sick and bother with products that just don't work?
[00:20:19.696 --> 00:20:24.137]  For just a dollar a day, Imudine is all natural and safe for all lifestyles.

[00:20:40.393 --> 00:20:41.153]  Hey, Boomer!
[00:20:41.393 --> 00:20:44.714]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[00:20:44.834 --> 00:20:46.415]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[00:20:46.515 --> 00:20:48.255]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[00:20:48.455 --> 00:20:53.937]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[00:20:54.297 --> 00:20:55.037]  I know, right?
[00:20:55.117 --> 00:20:56.077]  You love it, too!
[00:20:56.438 --> 00:20:57.738]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[00:20:57.878 --> 00:20:58.778]  Let's go get some.
[00:20:58.898 --> 00:21:00.599]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653.

[00:21:09.361 --> 00:21:10.262]  Alex Jones here.
[00:21:10.382 --> 00:21:19.330]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:24.775]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.

[00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:10.772]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[00:22:10.992 --> 00:22:15.575]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool, a pair of scissors.
[00:22:15.975 --> 00:22:21.478]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[00:22:21.759 --> 00:22:23.480]  Almost every home security system,
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.422]  Even those sold by big-name companies has a weakness.
[00:22:26.662 --> 00:22:27.483]  The phone line.
[00:22:27.643 --> 00:22:32.586]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[00:22:32.906 --> 00:22:36.689]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[00:22:36.829 --> 00:22:39.691]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[00:22:40.131 --> 00:22:42.393]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[00:22:42.593 --> 00:22:46.797]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[00:22:46.937 --> 00:22:47.837]  Scissors can't cut it.

[00:23:08.396 --> 00:23:10.237]  Mom, I can't do my math homework.
[00:23:10.458 --> 00:23:11.518]  I just don't get it.
[00:23:11.859 --> 00:23:12.759]  I hate math.
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:17.463]  I've always tried to be a good mother, but when it came to Jamie's math, I was at a loss.
[00:23:17.723 --> 00:23:20.365]  Then a friend told me about Math Made Easy DVDs.
[00:23:20.565 --> 00:23:23.767]  Concepts are simplified in an easy way to follow and review.
[00:23:24.008 --> 00:23:27.010]  And students can learn at their own pace in the convenience of home.

[00:24:14.329 --> 00:24:15.850]  This show is documented.
[00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:21.414]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:21.594 --> 00:24:24.616]  The story's up on InfoWars.com by Liberty Bloods Creek.
[00:24:24.636 --> 00:24:25.697]  It's also in Bloomberg.
[00:24:26.578 --> 00:24:28.359]  Linked up on DrugsReport.com.
[00:24:29.079 --> 00:24:31.521]  Billionaire tells Americans to expect less.
[00:24:32.602 --> 00:24:34.523]  Flies two nannies to Davos.
[00:24:37.245 --> 00:24:39.847]  Meanwhile you can see the InfoWars.com story right underneath that.
[00:24:40.207 --> 00:24:42.209]  Bill Gates pushes cashless society.
[00:24:43.695 --> 00:24:46.916]  I'm going to break down exactly what a casual society under this system means.
[00:24:48.996 --> 00:24:49.556]  Coming up.
[00:24:51.636 --> 00:24:54.277]  French court convicts three over homophobic tweets.
[00:24:55.217 --> 00:24:56.057]  Oh, I see.
[00:24:58.278 --> 00:24:59.458]  That's the one independent.
[00:24:59.518 --> 00:25:01.458]  I told you France doesn't have any free speech anymore.
[00:25:02.158 --> 00:25:09.240]  Unless it's Charlie Hebdo and you want to show the Prophet Muhammad performing oral sex on somebody.
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.380]  And hey, I say it's free speech, so...
[00:25:13.342 --> 00:25:18.065]  Doesn't mean I like to stir up trouble, doesn't mean I support it myself, but I support the free speech.
[00:25:18.485 --> 00:25:31.734]  But see, I don't support it because France and others have this march for freedom of speech when Merkel banned demonstrating against open borders by even mainline conservative groups in Germany.
[00:25:33.235 --> 00:25:39.780]  French court convicts three over homophobic tweets in case hailed a significant victory by LGBT rights campaigners.
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.121]  Yeah, that's right!
[00:25:42.113 --> 00:25:45.696]  Let's arrest people that criticize homosexuals.
[00:25:47.457 --> 00:25:50.940]  A French court has handed out convictions for anti-gay hate crimes on Twitter.
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.983]  For the first time, three people used the hashtag, let's burn the gays.
[00:25:57.145 --> 00:26:00.348]  Well, if you set a specific time and place and who to burn, it would be illegal.
[00:26:00.708 --> 00:26:03.750]  But the way they're ruling is they're saying, no, it was hateful, so it's illegal.
[00:26:04.391 --> 00:26:11.056]  And what a major French LGBT rights group called a significant victory, three people were convicted in Paris court this weekend.
[00:26:12.453 --> 00:26:16.434]  A company tweets with the hashtag, let's burn the gays.
[00:26:16.454 --> 00:26:19.676]  They're probably latent homosexuals that put that out.
[00:26:20.456 --> 00:26:31.900]  During the same period in August 2013, and I'm being sarcastic, but statistically folks that are obsessed with it are probably, you know, I mean everybody knows that, who's got a brain.
[00:26:33.178 --> 00:26:40.923]  Uh, French LGBT charity committee, Idaho, which organizes the Nation's International Day against homophobia.
[00:26:41.324 --> 00:26:42.504]  See, that's a bunch of bull.
[00:26:42.985 --> 00:26:44.125]  Calling it a mental illness.
[00:26:44.145 --> 00:26:45.206]  That's Soviet tyranny.
[00:26:45.646 --> 00:26:55.753]  If you don't like the whole liberal socialist gay agenda being pushed on you, and don't accept them brainwashing your kids, you're a homophobe.
[00:26:57.634 --> 00:27:02.798]  No, that's called having a preference in your life.
[00:27:05.742 --> 00:27:06.362]  But there you go.
[00:27:08.104 --> 00:27:10.505]  Very dangerous trend, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:11.226 --> 00:27:17.350]  You know, they tried to ban in France, well, have banned in France, Nazi memorabilia being sold on eBay.
[00:27:18.691 --> 00:27:21.853]  Most people that buy Nazi memorabilia are not Nazis.
[00:27:21.893 --> 00:27:29.118]  In fact, I've been at gun shows before and bought, you know, a German knife one time from World War II.
[00:27:30.647 --> 00:27:40.854]  I've got a Colt 911 from World War II, and I've got a German Luger from World War II.
[00:27:41.215 --> 00:27:43.977]  And it's not because I'm a Nazi, it's really an interesting gun.
[00:27:45.177 --> 00:27:59.908]  And everyone understands this, and when you go to the museum at the Smithsonian, and they got a whole area of Nazi stuff, or you go to the Pacific War Museum, it's excellent by the way, in Fredericksburg, Texas, as good as the Smithsonian in many ways, just the middle of nowhere.
[00:28:01.314 --> 00:28:03.795]  It's full of Nazi stuff and Japanese stuff.
[00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:07.177]  Doesn't mean they support... I mean, everyone knows this.
[00:28:08.198 --> 00:28:09.438]  But this is political correctness.
[00:28:09.498 --> 00:28:18.143]  It's just like the black woman that ran the restaurant at the casino read a book about Martin Luther King and his favorite foods, so she cooked Southern food.
[00:28:19.183 --> 00:28:21.685]  They call soul food because black folks eat Southern food.
[00:28:21.705 --> 00:28:23.886]  They're a big influence on Southern food.
[00:28:26.383 --> 00:28:28.344]  A lot of it is dishes that poor people would eat.
[00:28:28.624 --> 00:28:34.766]  Blacks would eat black-eyed peas and collard greens and stuff because it was seen as what poor people ate.
[00:28:35.106 --> 00:28:36.287]  They made a delicacy out of it.
[00:28:36.467 --> 00:28:38.128]  See, I don't know the whole history of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:38.148 --> 00:28:38.988]  I love black-eyed peas.
[00:28:39.348 --> 00:28:40.268]  I love collard greens.
[00:28:40.368 --> 00:28:41.249]  I love fried chicken.
[00:28:42.509 --> 00:28:43.390]  Because it tastes good.
[00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:45.831]  But I'm already digressing.
[00:28:46.211 --> 00:28:47.451]  This is the mindlessness.
[00:28:47.971 --> 00:28:50.833]  A black lady can't cook collard greens because black folks like it.
[00:28:51.593 --> 00:28:51.773]  What?
[00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:55.694]  I can't cook Mexican food because it's Mexican?
[00:28:55.714 --> 00:29:08.810]  See, this is the mental illness, while the real discrimination by the globalists is happening against all of us, having our money devalued, our environment poisoned, our kids turned against us, this huge positronic internet takeover grid.
[00:29:09.811 --> 00:29:11.092]  Rolling out against everybody.
[00:29:11.332 --> 00:29:13.153]  We're only in the bait phase of the internet.
[00:29:13.813 --> 00:29:15.454]  The new controlled web is coming in.
[00:29:15.875 --> 00:29:22.078]  Facebook is adopting publicly the communist Chinese model of censorship and has now launched it three weeks after meeting with them.
[00:29:22.458 --> 00:29:24.520]  We're all being overwritten.
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:26.321]  Erased.
[00:29:27.742 --> 00:29:29.162]  We're being destroyed.
[00:29:29.723 --> 00:29:31.384]  A tiny technocracy is running it.
[00:29:33.085 --> 00:29:33.965]  And we gotta come together.
[00:29:34.886 --> 00:29:36.687]  That's why I don't want to fight with the police.
[00:29:37.918 --> 00:29:41.420]  That's why I don't want to fight with the military, because they're being brainwashed as well.
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:44.701]  We got to come together against the technocracy, and we come back.
[00:29:45.361 --> 00:29:51.144]  I've got some horrible, horrible activities by the police we're going to expose, but not because we hate them.
[00:29:51.904 --> 00:29:57.527]  Because we want to correct this behavior from a position of moral strength, not mindless hatred.
[00:29:59.368 --> 00:30:00.308]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.748 --> 00:30:02.349]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:05.971]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.382 --> 00:30:11.283]  Alex Jones here.
[00:30:11.383 --> 00:30:20.353]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.

[00:31:22.124 --> 00:31:27.148]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:33:31.936 --> 00:33:40.424]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:40.444 --> 00:33:47.650]  Johnny, be good!
[00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:48.851]  Crank it up for a moment.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:15.131]  There's a lot of human talent out there, music, science, you name it, that is being squashed by this global digital overwrite, where the elite are deciding the future of humanity.
[00:34:15.151 --> 00:34:23.277]  I know I harp on that a lot, but the new digital royalty, the Googles and Microsofts of the world, are eugenicists.
[00:34:24.972 --> 00:34:27.936]  And do not have very good intentions for the public.
[00:34:28.316 --> 00:34:31.680]  I want to go to John, Matt, Frank, Stefan, Kevin, and many others.
[00:34:32.141 --> 00:34:33.422]  It's wide open phones today.
[00:34:33.482 --> 00:34:37.867]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:34:38.628 --> 00:34:42.333]  Obviously, I'm going to talk about what's being called a worst-case scenario.
[00:34:42.793 --> 00:34:43.714]  Yemen chaos.
[00:34:44.375 --> 00:34:48.977]  As the President flees, Saudi King's death poses new challenges for the U.S.
[00:34:49.657 --> 00:34:55.519]  Major controversy, especially in the U.K., over half-masked for the Saudi King.
[00:34:55.539 --> 00:35:05.803]  I mean, the Saudi King, his father was put into power by the British in 1903.
[00:35:06.323 --> 00:35:08.864]  By 1931, they'd taken over most of the Middle East.
[00:35:08.904 --> 00:35:13.566]  It was one Bedouin group that they gave rockets and hand grenades and stuff to, and machine guns.
[00:35:14.505 --> 00:35:15.426]  And they just took over.
[00:35:16.686 --> 00:35:18.507]  Ended up taking over Syria as well.
[00:35:19.668 --> 00:35:22.029]  They are just absolute thumb-at-the-mouth demons.
[00:35:24.211 --> 00:35:27.432]  And a lot of the women and people that get kidnapped in this country get flown over there.
[00:35:28.113 --> 00:35:30.954]  I mean, it is Baron Harkonnen-level craziness.
[00:35:31.555 --> 00:35:35.317]  Makes North Korean seven-story pleasure palaces pale.
[00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:42.992]  And of course the degenerate pedophile-filled monarchy is endorsing these degenerates.
[00:35:43.112 --> 00:35:45.312]  They are puppets of the British monarchy.
[00:35:48.073 --> 00:35:50.633]  And the British monarchy is not British royalty.
[00:35:52.694 --> 00:36:03.537]  You haven't had a house there that was actually from those aisles since William the Conqueror took over in 1100 and change.
[00:36:06.974 --> 00:36:25.280]  They overtook the Saxons, and of course we're talking about the Norman, a Germanic group, a Viking German-French, and then you expand out from that, it's not even German royalty today, it's a Transylvanian-Germanic bloodline that runs it, and they are the scum of the earth.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:32.502]  And they lobby for carbon taxes, global government, it is their plan we're living under with the robot takeover.
[00:36:34.522 --> 00:36:50.509]  And I guess, in their words, they deserve to be in control, and I guess they kind of do, from a survival of the fittest, social Darwinistic view, because they are the ones that financed the scientists 170 years ago, I don't know, 1850 or so.
[00:36:50.529 --> 00:36:52.550]  The plan was public in 1855.
[00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:58.153]  You know, I harp on this a lot because if people don't know that this is all planned out,
[00:36:59.946 --> 00:37:11.332]  And when you know there's a world government scientific takeover, planned out, it took them a hundred and something years to get it pretty much in place, we're now in the last few minutes of the ballgame.
[00:37:13.514 --> 00:37:14.674]  Here in the next few decades.
[00:37:17.476 --> 00:37:18.957]  And God help us.
[00:37:19.997 --> 00:37:21.318]  If I was a self-centered person,
[00:37:24.622 --> 00:37:32.727]  I would just get out of here and move to the safest third world country I could, keep my head down, and then just constantly move and try to get away from the technology.
[00:37:34.188 --> 00:37:45.596]  Because it's not the technology itself's evil, it's that all of it is being deployed and rolled out where you pay for it and it has one function you think you've got it for, but really it's a total control mechanism.
[00:37:47.759 --> 00:37:54.446]  Like whether you ask for it or not now, the new iPhones and Droids have systems that monitor your breath, your heart rate, everywhere you go, what you do.
[00:37:54.487 --> 00:37:55.327]  People think it's so neat.
[00:37:55.347 --> 00:37:56.729]  They go, look, it knows everything I did.
[00:37:57.069 --> 00:38:00.193]  Yeah, it's a government surveillance imperial probe droid.
[00:38:01.054 --> 00:38:01.715]  In their words.
[00:38:02.816 --> 00:38:04.097]  You think smart meters are bad?
[00:38:04.197 --> 00:38:07.040]  I mean, do you understand, folks?
[00:38:07.141 --> 00:38:08.282]  This is not my opinion.
[00:38:12.523 --> 00:38:23.466]  I mean, I've got more interesting news than I could ever cover, and this be a riveting radio show, you know, the kind of science fiction porn, fear porn, apocalypse porn that we get called on the news.
[00:38:23.846 --> 00:38:24.907]  Yes, we are that.
[00:38:25.207 --> 00:38:30.248]  But not to get ratings to try to stop what's happening, because it is going on.
[00:38:30.989 --> 00:38:33.249]  If you want to call fear porn, fear porn, fine.
[00:38:33.329 --> 00:38:34.470]  It's reality porn.
[00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:38.571]  It's truth is stranger than fiction porn.
[00:38:40.259 --> 00:38:55.769]  Let me tell you, it's very inviting to go plug into the Matrix and play along with the system, because there is another route, not run from it, but throw myself at the feet of the establishment, try to join them, try to spin everything that's happening, and then work for a position in the technocracy.
[00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:59.431]  But I don't want to interface with these machines.
[00:39:00.472 --> 00:39:01.012]  It's a fraud.
[00:39:01.032 --> 00:39:01.893]  I'm not going to live forever.
[00:39:01.913 --> 00:39:03.434]  I'm going to lose my soul.
[00:39:03.934 --> 00:39:05.775]  It's all a giant cosmic con game.
[00:39:06.176 --> 00:39:09.198]  Everything the New World Order does produces death on the other end.
[00:39:09.884 --> 00:39:10.684]  It's a big scam.
[00:39:10.945 --> 00:39:12.085]  I don't want red carpets.
[00:39:12.425 --> 00:39:13.506]  I don't want big jets.
[00:39:14.046 --> 00:39:15.807]  I don't want to have everybody kiss my butt.
[00:39:16.448 --> 00:39:17.468]  I want to be left alone.
[00:39:17.809 --> 00:39:20.530]  But the New World Order won't leave me alone.
[00:39:22.431 --> 00:39:26.834]  And I'll be overrun by the giant mass of dumbed-down people if I don't try to reach out to folks.
[00:39:27.234 --> 00:39:28.595]  I can't just give up on humanity.
[00:39:30.696 --> 00:39:32.537]  And I see people sell out to them all the time.
[00:39:34.158 --> 00:39:35.899]  That's why I can't even watch they live.
[00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:48.957]  That's an allegory of what's going on when they're down there in the subterranean base and the aliens are in their suits with everybody else and they're getting everybody to sell out to them, bragging about how great they're doing.
[00:39:53.478 --> 00:39:54.238]  God almighty.
[00:39:55.638 --> 00:39:56.778]  This is so real.
[00:39:57.358 --> 00:39:58.039]  It's so real.
[00:40:02.239 --> 00:40:04.240]  You know, I don't even want to get into this police stuff.
[00:40:06.584 --> 00:40:07.845]  Because I understand the whole thing.
[00:40:10.187 --> 00:40:15.791]  And it's so hard to articulate because it's so complex and so subtle from both perspectives.
[00:40:18.394 --> 00:40:19.254]  But I'm going to do it.
[00:40:23.177 --> 00:40:26.180]  I'm going to break it down as best I can.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.822]  But let me just do this.
[00:40:28.882 --> 00:40:29.483]  Let me just do this.
[00:40:29.643 --> 00:40:31.464]  I will cover it at 8 after next hour.
[00:40:35.187 --> 00:40:36.088]  And I'll play these clips.
[00:40:38.473 --> 00:40:39.534]  I'll go to your calls right now.
[00:40:40.894 --> 00:40:43.656]  And I'll get into Saudi Arabian king dying and all the rest of it.
[00:40:45.597 --> 00:40:52.600]  I was watching CNN this morning to monitor their transmissions.
[00:40:54.801 --> 00:40:59.944]  And you would have thought that Jesus himself had just died with the king dying.
[00:41:02.265 --> 00:41:07.328]  And the Saudi royalty is just about as bad as it gets.
[00:41:11.533 --> 00:41:21.218]  And it shows how our CIA, it's not our CIA, it's the Robber Baron's CIA, works to put dictatorships and oppressive regimes in worldwide.
[00:41:21.918 --> 00:41:30.083]  So of course they're working to do that here, and all they need now, with the militarized police in place, is to start a war with the police,
[00:41:31.544 --> 00:41:38.168]  They've just got to find an ignorant enough group to do it, to seal the deal and get the civil war going.
[00:41:38.629 --> 00:41:42.131]  And the reason I harp on that is, that's their whole ballgame domestically.
[00:41:42.611 --> 00:41:44.172]  Just like it's their ballgame in other countries.
[00:41:44.513 --> 00:41:59.703]  Ukraine, Yemen, Syria, Libya, Angola, the Congo, Indonesia, everywhere else.
[00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:06.623]  It's just frustrating knowing how right I am, having the whole battle plan.
[00:42:07.823 --> 00:42:09.784]  And then it's all public is what's frustrating.
[00:42:11.184 --> 00:42:22.409]  And I can't find many government people, or many intellectual scientists, PhDs, that even have close to the grasp I have.
[00:42:22.429 --> 00:42:23.890]  Do you know how scary that is?
[00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:26.711]  Because I'm not on a power trip, I don't think of myself as that smart.
[00:42:28.223 --> 00:42:34.906]  And then I do talk to medical doctors, scientists, genetic engineers, and people, and they go, yes, we know it's very sad.
[00:42:35.346 --> 00:42:42.208]  That's why we've moved to the country and just want to try to raise our children and hope we can have some life before the overwrite comes.
[00:42:43.629 --> 00:42:52.212]  I can't tell you how many times I've been invited to some cookout or to some mansion, you know, out in the hill country.
[00:42:52.412 --> 00:42:55.834]  And, and, and, you know, you're looking at people's, uh,
[00:42:57.324 --> 00:43:20.143]  Diplomas on the walls, nobody else at the party is, and you strike up a conversation with somebody, and then they go, oh yes, I know your show, I don't really tune in because I separately learned about this when I was a graduate student at MIT, and you know, my wife and I and the children, we're just here, you know, waiting, and oh, these are some of our friends, they understand as well.
[00:43:20.803 --> 00:43:22.684]  And you're just like, so you're just not even going to fight it.
[00:43:22.704 --> 00:43:26.365]  You're just going to go run off to the countryside and just wait for this to come.
[00:43:26.705 --> 00:43:28.165]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
[00:43:28.545 --> 00:43:34.587]  Or you got the Eric Schmitz running around giggling with Bill Joy and all the other elites going, yeah, everybody's going to be exterminated.
[00:43:34.607 --> 00:43:35.647]  Ha ha, world government.
[00:43:36.147 --> 00:43:38.448]  Yeah, micro mosquitoes are going to suck your blood.
[00:43:38.488 --> 00:43:40.808]  Bill Gates is coming out with those forced inoculations.
[00:43:40.868 --> 00:43:41.809]  It's all being announced.
[00:43:44.469 --> 00:43:46.730]  Schmidt comes out and announces brain chips, you know.
[00:43:49.364 --> 00:43:57.609]  We need a graphic or somebody out there, a cartoonist, to show 1947, the television, and no longer are people around the table eating dinner.
[00:43:57.649 --> 00:43:59.851]  Now they're sitting there looking at the television.
[00:43:59.931 --> 00:44:01.111]  It's now the father figure.
[00:44:01.612 --> 00:44:02.812]  It now gives all the orders.
[00:44:03.433 --> 00:44:04.854]  And so Daddy's comfortable with it.
[00:44:05.094 --> 00:44:07.555]  The first messages are pretty much in line with Daddy.
[00:44:08.516 --> 00:44:10.097]  So Daddy says, this is good.
[00:44:10.497 --> 00:44:11.118]  This is good.
[00:44:11.438 --> 00:44:12.218]  This is good food.
[00:44:12.478 --> 00:44:13.199]  This is good water.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.061]  Lines up everybody to do what it says.
[00:44:16.823 --> 00:44:18.203]  Couple years later, it changed a little bit.
[00:44:18.243 --> 00:44:20.104]  Daddy doesn't like that, but he's got shows he likes.
[00:44:20.424 --> 00:44:21.704]  Mama's got shows she likes.
[00:44:22.084 --> 00:44:25.545]  Junior and little Betty, they've all got shows they like.
[00:44:26.045 --> 00:44:27.865]  See, it's all departmentalized now, the programming.
[00:44:29.926 --> 00:44:31.406]  All war-gamed out on record.
[00:44:32.526 --> 00:44:40.228]  And then you go from television to the flat screens and the computers and the handhelds to the glasses to the...
[00:44:41.598 --> 00:44:51.865]  contacts to the implants and you can see the television evolve towards from the proto-matrix to the matrix.
[00:44:54.567 --> 00:45:11.019]  And then you discover back in the seventies the National Federation of Scientists and the International Federation all wrote about this, the plan, the Pentagon, how we'll finally, if they allow us to even live, we will be from birth to death in virtual reality
[00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:19.417]  Sensory deprivation tanks with wires and chips in our brains, and our heat will be used to power things.
[00:45:19.918 --> 00:45:20.719]  Oh, the Matrix!
[00:45:21.179 --> 00:45:26.444]  And you find out, that's their plan, if they even decide to use us, is to put us in tanks!
[00:45:27.605 --> 00:45:30.448]  Go look it up, it's in my book, Descent into Tyranny, it's online.
[00:45:31.469 --> 00:45:34.112]  You can go pull up all that stuff, I mean, I just cannot believe it.
[00:45:38.294 --> 00:45:44.999]  And people will opt to be movie stars in the fantasy world and to be put into the tanks.
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:54.947]  And at first, just like they condition you, you'll have a simulation body that'll be biomechanical that you'll still be able to run around in the real world.
[00:45:56.288 --> 00:46:00.991]  But pretty soon folks will just hang those up like an old pair of roller skates and you'll just live in the tank.
[00:46:02.653 --> 00:46:04.314]  They made a Bruce Willis movie about that.
[00:46:08.749 --> 00:46:10.231]  God, they just throw it all in our face.
[00:46:13.596 --> 00:46:19.244]  Alright, I'm gonna go to John and Matt and Frank and Stefan and Kevin and everybody else here.
[00:46:21.567 --> 00:46:23.250]  You know, I don't know what I'm supposed to do, okay?
[00:46:25.293 --> 00:46:25.973]  It's all true.
[00:46:26.013 --> 00:46:26.894]  It's all happening.
[00:46:26.914 --> 00:46:28.174]  The government runs Al-Qaeda.
[00:46:28.315 --> 00:46:40.380]  They're putting cancer viruses in your vaccines, fluoride in your water to brain damage, your Harvard studies, and then I've got all their admissions where they, you know, write about in all these countless books, like Ecoscience and others, why they're doing it so that you're more manageable.
[00:46:40.641 --> 00:46:42.421]  I mean, they're just murdering our brains already.
[00:46:43.022 --> 00:46:43.722]  So just whatever!
[00:46:43.782 --> 00:46:44.963]  Turn the world over to pure evil?
[00:46:45.003 --> 00:46:45.203]  Great!
[00:46:47.042 --> 00:46:51.604]  Because all these evil technocrats have little beards and are real skinny and talk real soft.
[00:46:52.264 --> 00:46:55.005]  Oh, hi, I'm Paul Ehrlichman.
[00:46:55.065 --> 00:46:56.265]  I'm John P. Haldren.
[00:46:56.385 --> 00:46:57.786]  Oh, hi, I'm Bill Gates.
[00:46:58.446 --> 00:46:59.106]  Oh, hi!
[00:46:59.566 --> 00:47:04.788]  You know, if we didn't give an old lady health care, we could hire ten teachers, but that's a death penalty.
[00:47:04.808 --> 00:47:05.668]  This is my...
[00:47:08.169 --> 00:47:17.053]  This is my disciplined act to make you not understand I am a super mega alpha male psychopath, hardcore aggressive.
[00:47:19.615 --> 00:47:30.040]  I work about 16 hours a day flying all over in geoengineering, mapping how to poison your intestines with the vaccines and then have treatments for it, bioweapons.
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.341]  You know, it's just all real funny.
[00:47:33.439 --> 00:47:35.061]  It's all real funny.
[00:47:35.081 --> 00:47:37.503]  It's all real NPR.
[00:47:38.444 --> 00:47:38.484]  Hi!
[00:47:38.784 --> 00:47:39.925]  We're not a threat.
[00:47:40.346 --> 00:47:41.587]  Here's a smart meter.
[00:47:42.147 --> 00:47:43.629]  Here's a phone for your kid.
[00:47:43.929 --> 00:47:46.151]  Here's a shot so you don't get sick.
[00:47:46.732 --> 00:47:48.133]  We really love you.
[00:47:48.153 --> 00:47:48.233]  Okay?
[00:47:51.957 --> 00:47:54.719]  When in truth, if you could hear them, it wouldn't even be intelligible.
[00:47:54.759 --> 00:47:59.824]  Their souls is just more like screaming and nails on chalk.
[00:48:00.024 --> 00:48:03.687]  Like a Tasmanian devil that wants to rip you and your family to pieces.
[00:48:04.027 --> 00:48:05.348]  But oh, I'm liberal.
[00:48:05.368 --> 00:48:06.649]  Oh, it's for your own good.
[00:48:06.669 --> 00:48:07.550]  Oh, yeah.
[00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:33.371]  All they want is compliance.
[00:48:34.492 --> 00:48:39.755]  And as society degenerates, the police will be trained that if you don't comply immediately, you'll just be shot on the spot.
[00:48:42.397 --> 00:48:47.700]  And then more cops will get killed as the warrior instinct kicks in in the public to see them as the enemy.
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:51.303]  And that'll further militarize the police.
[00:48:51.863 --> 00:48:54.905]  Then their numbers of dead will be so high, the robots will roll out.
[00:48:58.448 --> 00:49:01.510]  See, our pushing against the police is what will then
[00:49:02.682 --> 00:49:20.038]  incentivize and energize them in a laboratory war game to transfer them from peace officers to occupying technicians in the transition to the rise of the machines.
[00:49:25.143 --> 00:49:26.424]  And they'll never know what hit them either.
[00:49:28.373 --> 00:49:35.639]  They don't know why their kids are dying of cancer, or why their kids can't talk, or why their young wife's got cancer, or why their brother's got cancer.
[00:49:35.679 --> 00:49:36.319]  They don't know either.
[00:49:36.339 --> 00:49:37.180]  They're just like the public.
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.141]  They're just like babies.
[00:49:38.781 --> 00:49:40.282]  Babes to slaughter like everybody else.
[00:49:40.302 --> 00:49:40.943]  They just don't know.
[00:49:42.804 --> 00:49:45.226]  It's just too much fun to be part of the system.
[00:49:46.007 --> 00:49:49.890]  The system knows how to archetypally program people in ancient human emotions.
[00:49:51.171 --> 00:49:53.533]  We're gonna go to break, come back with your calls, and then I'll
[00:49:56.547 --> 00:49:59.589]  I'll get to the police stuff and tie it into this incredible video.
[00:50:01.871 --> 00:50:03.132]  These two stories tie together.
[00:50:03.192 --> 00:50:07.635]  Video, UFC star Taze arrested after asking cops for ID.
[00:50:09.237 --> 00:50:15.601]  Another one, black man who tortured and executed two white teens makes Black Lives Matter speech at sentencing.
[00:50:15.942 --> 00:50:20.665]  The family said, we forgive you for killing our sons and torturing them to death.
[00:50:20.705 --> 00:50:22.486]  And then he just says, look, it's okay.
[00:50:22.546 --> 00:50:24.288]  I did it because there's a war on blacks.
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:28.521]  And this guy thinks he's good for doing it.
[00:50:29.302 --> 00:50:36.507]  Just like as the police commit crimes against the public, the public more and more will see them as the enemy and then just randomly kill cops.
[00:50:36.987 --> 00:50:37.708]  It's the same thing.
[00:50:37.768 --> 00:50:42.732]  Some white person does something bad to you when you're black, so then a random white person needs to die.
[00:50:43.052 --> 00:50:47.115]  This is the mindless tribalism programming that's unfolding.
[00:50:49.452 --> 00:50:53.636]  By the way, at current sales rates, we will sell out of Ancient Defense by sometime next week.
[00:50:53.776 --> 00:50:54.937]  It's 25% off.
[00:50:55.498 --> 00:51:01.363]  One of the best herbal immunity boosters out there, and it is very well priced at $14.95.
[00:51:01.603 --> 00:51:04.486]  Two ounces of it, that's over a month's supply.
[00:51:05.487 --> 00:51:07.228]  Everybody should be boosting their immunity right now.
[00:51:07.288 --> 00:51:08.109]  Infowarslife.com.

[00:51:42.823 --> 00:51:46.626]  Snapforce Customer Relationship Software may be just what you need.
[00:51:46.867 --> 00:51:49.209]  Snapforce CRM is a software solution.
[00:51:49.369 --> 00:51:49.649]  We're good.
[00:52:09.523 --> 00:52:12.105]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:12.366 --> 00:52:17.230]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:25.377]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:25.618 --> 00:52:29.921]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:30.142 --> 00:52:33.945]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:34.085 --> 00:52:39.809]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:40.049 --> 00:52:42.831]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:43.211 --> 00:52:48.435]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:52:48.575 --> 00:52:56.700]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:56.940]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:53:06.407 --> 00:53:11.792]  This is a serious topic for all men.
[00:53:12.172 --> 00:53:16.256]  Every single man listening may have a prostate problem if he lives long enough.
[00:53:16.616 --> 00:53:17.057]  That's right.
[00:53:17.497 --> 00:53:19.899]  All of us men may suffer from a prostate problem.
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:24.804]  Like urinating more often, waking at night to urinate, or problems with intimacy.
[00:53:25.064 --> 00:53:30.289]  That's why every man needs to call for a free bottle of Super Beta Prostate.
[00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:35.473]  A non-prescription formula guaranteed to reduce the symptoms of your enlarged prostate.

[00:53:56.491 --> 00:53:57.891]  Call for your free bottle.
[00:53:58.231 --> 00:53:58.751]  Just call 1-800-964-7470.
[00:53:58.771 --> 00:53:58.991]  That's 1-800-964-7470.
[00:53:59.011 --> 00:53:59.171]  Call 1-800-964-7470.
[00:53:59.211 --> 00:54:00.112]  Riders on the storm.
[00:54:00.132 --> 00:54:00.732]  Riders on the storm.
[00:54:00.752 --> 00:54:02.692]  To this world we're born and to this world we're thrown.
[00:54:02.812 --> 00:54:03.972]  Into this house we're born.
[00:54:27.316 --> 00:54:28.837]  Here's what I have to say on that front.
[00:54:29.118 --> 00:54:40.027]  People deserve at least to know their future is being controlled, their destiny is being destroyed, their free will is being annihilated, and at the end of the tunnel is death.
[00:54:41.888 --> 00:54:42.909]  Death of the species.
[00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:44.871]  Don't worry about yourself dying.
[00:54:44.891 --> 00:54:46.152]  What about your progeny?
[00:54:46.192 --> 00:54:47.433]  What about humanity itself?
[00:54:47.934 --> 00:54:52.197]  What about an elite that decided we're ugly and bad and that we're a scourge on the planet we've got to be gotten rid of?
[00:54:52.217 --> 00:54:55.220]  That's what they teach us, that humans are bad all day and hurt the Earth.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.741]  It's so that we don't have our survival mechanism anymore.
[00:55:06.004 --> 00:55:07.544]  Here's some of what we're talking about.
[00:55:07.965 --> 00:55:13.147]  Project HoloLens, our exclusive hands-on with Microsoft's holographic goggles.
[00:55:13.827 --> 00:55:24.151]  Again on a Wired Magazine where everything around you is listed and named, everyone's house, as you drive down the street with these, this is where Bob Jones lives, this is where Tom Sanchez lives, this is where
[00:55:28.993 --> 00:55:36.596]  And again, it's being deployed and used so they can surveil, and so you're now basically a bot for Microsoft or Google while you're out there.
[00:55:38.417 --> 00:55:42.179]  Google glasses didn't take off because it makes people nauseated, so now they come out with this.
[00:55:42.599 --> 00:55:45.701]  And more and more young people say they want to live in a virtual reality.
[00:55:46.961 --> 00:55:50.303]  They see it as a success that they're doing well in their imaginary world.
[00:55:54.585 --> 00:55:55.025]  It's sick.
[00:55:57.602 --> 00:55:58.645]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[00:56:00.391 --> 00:56:02.256]  John in Wyoming, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:56:03.319 --> 00:56:04.182]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:56:05.753 --> 00:56:14.782]  Alex, here in Sheridan in north central Wyoming, several of us have been fighting this water fluoridation issue now for over four years.
[00:56:15.462 --> 00:56:19.086]  And we have these eugenicists who are running the show up here.
[00:56:19.666 --> 00:56:25.832]  The previous mayor, let's just call him Boss Hog, was the one promoting this.
[00:56:25.872 --> 00:56:29.035]  He was also the one who was fighting any attempt
[00:56:29.751 --> 00:56:38.496]  At us to have the state require food processors to label their foods, whether or not they're wholesome and natural versus genetically modified.
[00:56:39.176 --> 00:56:47.640]  And then when a state senator passed away of health causes, then this guy got himself appointed to the state Senate.
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:56.165]  And now he went up to one of the only two of six city council members who had voted against water fluoridation in December of 2010.
[00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:05.982]  And got him all of a sudden to vote for water fluoridation with the promise of he would be the next mayor, which he is now.
[00:57:06.723 --> 00:57:13.844]  So we've got a bunch of shysters up here who are forcing the people despite the fact that in a small town of 17,500 people,
[00:57:16.326 --> 00:57:20.811]  We submitted petitions with over 2,000 signatures.
[00:57:21.211 --> 00:57:23.613]  Yeah, well, what you want doesn't matter, see, because they're the boss.
[00:57:23.653 --> 00:57:24.574]  And, of course, you know what it is.
[00:57:24.594 --> 00:57:37.707]  Depending on the size of your town, I would imagine they're going to, and you probably have the answer to this, but Austin pays millions a year for its so-called fluoride from Florida that's actually hundreds of deadly chemicals, the leftover of phosphate mines.
[00:57:38.488 --> 00:57:40.670]  Uh, and so this would be toxic waste they'd have to store.
[00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:45.073]  They just come grease these politicians with, uh, campaign contributions.
[00:57:45.693 --> 00:57:48.555]  At the state level, maybe $10,000 or so on average.
[00:57:48.575 --> 00:57:49.696]  At the city level, less.
[00:57:50.076 --> 00:57:55.540]  And then they will do that and basically sell you out and then dump poison in your water.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.701]  And this is authorized from the top.
[00:57:57.761 --> 00:58:05.627]  All the low-level folks do it for money because it's a hardcore adjuvant, uh, that accelerates all the other trace drugs they're putting in the water.
[00:58:05.647 --> 00:58:07.428]  Uh, and so that's what's going on.
[00:58:08.334 --> 00:58:18.201]  Well, and not only that, Alex, but the fact is Sheridan is the only town in the state of Wyoming which actually adds fluoride to their drinking water.
[00:58:18.221 --> 00:58:19.883]  Yeah, I see the headline out of the Sheridan Press.
[00:58:19.943 --> 00:58:21.844]  Will fluoride make history again in Sheridan?
[00:58:23.265 --> 00:58:26.728]  Yeah, it'll make history, alright, because these bums are gonna get thrown out.
[00:58:28.445 --> 00:58:29.906]  Absolutely, but they'll get new bums.
[00:58:30.266 --> 00:58:32.127]  And again, the essence is keep fighting.
[00:58:32.567 --> 00:58:34.508]  But they need to brain damage you and your family.
[00:58:34.528 --> 00:58:37.089]  They need a seven-fold increase in bone cancer from the fluoride.
[00:58:37.469 --> 00:58:38.649]  They want to hurt you and your family.
[00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:42.091]  These little nobodies, they're just getting 30 pieces of silver.
[00:58:42.431 --> 00:58:43.151]  But great points.
[00:58:43.191 --> 00:58:46.953]  Thank you so much, John, Matt, Frank, Stefan, Kevin.

[01:00:33.001 --> 01:00:43.384]  Front page of InfoWars.com, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the corporate states of America, and to the plutocracy for which it stands, one nation under death, easily divisible with congressman and justice.
[01:00:44.044 --> 01:00:44.344]  Roll!
[01:00:47.967 --> 01:00:48.907]  We had open phones.
[01:00:49.048 --> 01:00:52.489]  I'm going to break down two chilling videos.
[01:00:53.169 --> 01:00:56.651]  UFC star Taze arrested after asking cops for ID.
[01:00:58.192 --> 01:01:03.734]  We also have Texas cops jail woman for walking without a license.
[01:01:03.794 --> 01:01:04.435]  I'm not kidding.
[01:01:06.976 --> 01:01:08.257]  And that ties into this story.
[01:01:08.317 --> 01:01:12.939]  Black man who tortured, executed two white teens, makes Black Lives Matter speech.
[01:01:14.138 --> 01:01:14.258]  Alex?
[01:01:14.298 --> 01:01:14.879]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:01:15.399 --> 01:01:17.001]  I just wanted to talk about 9-11 quickly.
[01:01:17.061 --> 01:01:20.244]  I know this is not in the news... Hey, it's wide open phones, brother.
[01:01:20.264 --> 01:01:22.166]  It's whatever you want to cover.
[01:01:38.243 --> 01:01:41.073]  Alright, well, I mean, I live in Northeast New Jersey.
[01:01:41.113 --> 01:01:44.625]  I live literally five minutes away from Lower Manhattan, and my father was in...
[01:01:45.365 --> 01:01:48.126]  My father was in Midtown and my uncle was in Midtown on that day.
[01:01:48.186 --> 01:01:51.346]  So this is not, you know, removed from my life at all.
[01:01:51.366 --> 01:01:53.347]  This was literally in my life.
[01:01:53.407 --> 01:01:55.547]  My father and my uncle were both in the city at the time.
[01:01:55.587 --> 01:02:02.248]  Now, I guess you preface that because usually the comeback line against anybody questioning the official story is, were you there?
[01:02:02.468 --> 01:02:03.789]  Did you lose anybody?
[01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:04.749]  Then shut up!
[01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:08.530]  Yeah, I lost my freedom as a response to this and I'm going to expose it.
[01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:08.930]  Go ahead.
[01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:14.911]  Okay, so you know that there are multiple smoking guns.
[01:02:15.638 --> 01:02:17.959]  Uh, you know, considering the fraud of 9-11.
[01:02:17.999 --> 01:02:25.500]  Webster Tarpley has been on your show exposing, I don't know, how many different drills he identified that day that went live.
[01:02:26.601 --> 01:02:28.701]  It's absolutely amazing to me.
[01:02:28.781 --> 01:02:33.202]  As somebody who actually experienced this firsthand, and it was scary as hell.
[01:02:33.242 --> 01:02:35.803]  This was a terrifying thing for me.
[01:02:35.883 --> 01:02:37.323]  And I obviously was a lot younger, but
[01:02:37.805 --> 01:02:38.666]  Well, sure.
[01:03:05.569 --> 01:03:06.770]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:07.550]  It's great points, Matt.
[01:03:07.690 --> 01:03:13.534]  I'm going to talk to you at the end of the break, come back and come to Stefan and Kevin and Harry and Regina and others.
[01:03:15.175 --> 01:03:19.098]  And in taking nothing away from Tarpley, he wrote Synthetic Terror, 9-11 Synthetic Terror.
[01:03:19.118 --> 01:03:24.361]  It's an excellent book, great analysis, but I don't want to say Webster Tarpley identified drills.
[01:03:25.814 --> 01:03:32.039]  I had guests on who I would then have cover things over and over again, hundreds of times.
[01:03:32.919 --> 01:03:34.340]  But he's not the source of that.
[01:03:35.041 --> 01:03:37.863]  The source is USA Today, Associated Press, Reuters.
[01:03:38.383 --> 01:03:42.246]  For those that are new listeners, it's not that some researchers said that.
[01:03:43.287 --> 01:03:51.693]  The Pentagon, the CIA had drills of jets being flown into the exact same targets that day, two months before, and a year before.
[01:03:52.921 --> 01:04:00.850]  Dick Cheney had an order signed to take the power of the Pentagon and NORAD to shoot down errant aircraft.
[01:04:01.251 --> 01:04:04.634]  He took it away a month and a half before, gave it back a week after.
[01:04:05.996 --> 01:04:07.578]  So he could order the stand down that day.
[01:04:08.547 --> 01:04:15.232]  And we've had Panetta, the head of the Transportation Commission, Norman Panetta come out and say that four times.
[01:04:15.812 --> 01:04:18.994]  We've played the video clips from Congress and he was asked later to clarify.
[01:04:20.035 --> 01:04:22.777]  We've had Senator Graham come out and say there was a stand down.
[01:04:25.499 --> 01:04:30.442]  And that the Saudis were basically quarterbacking the operation, but that NORAD stood down.
[01:04:31.703 --> 01:04:37.848]  So it doesn't mean there aren't terrorists, it doesn't mean there aren't attacks, but inside the government there was a stand down to let that take place.
[01:04:38.749 --> 01:04:41.250]  And we confirmed this, it later even came out.
[01:04:43.592 --> 01:04:49.635]  The Air National Guard refused to stand down on flight 93 and shot the thing down.
[01:04:50.135 --> 01:04:55.859]  And it came out in the air traffic tapes that they put two AIM-9, that's sidewinder missiles, into the aircraft.
[01:04:56.219 --> 01:04:57.499]  And it was going to the Capitol.
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:01.822]  Can you imagine the tyranny we'd be under if the Capitol was completely destroyed that day?
[01:05:03.146 --> 01:05:09.219]  So this was an internal coup d'etat, working with Saudi Arabia, as usual, to overthrow the country.
[01:05:10.202 --> 01:05:14.064]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[01:05:14.824 --> 01:05:21.068]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[01:05:21.188 --> 01:05:30.233]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.

[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.500]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:54.842]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[01:05:55.162 --> 01:05:57.402]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[01:05:57.683 --> 01:05:58.523]  But for how long?
[01:05:58.823 --> 01:06:05.085]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.

[01:06:09.775 --> 01:06:18.440]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[01:06:18.761 --> 01:06:28.747]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[01:06:29.307 --> 01:06:35.389]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:06:35.729 --> 01:06:41.872]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:06:42.132 --> 01:06:45.293]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections and
[01:06:45.593 --> 01:06:50.317]  Adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[01:06:50.738 --> 01:06:53.520]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[01:08:00.726 --> 01:08:04.108]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:21.587 --> 01:08:30.578]  Coming up, we'll break down the latest from the globalist CONFAB at Davos as they announce global carbon taxes, world government, an internet takeover, and more.
[01:08:32.901 --> 01:08:40.451]  Yesterday on the nightly news, Joe Biggs put out a report basically saying that the Japanese
[01:08:41.897 --> 01:08:44.258]  Beheading ISIS clip was fake.
[01:08:44.418 --> 01:08:46.658]  Analyzing it, that's now been confirmed.
[01:08:47.439 --> 01:08:54.321]  Out of Fox News, experts say ISIS ransom clip faked as deadline for Japanese hostages passes.
[01:08:55.141 --> 01:09:00.643]  Facebook, death threat against activists doesn't violate community standards, but Facebook will suppress posts.
[01:09:01.423 --> 01:09:03.464]  Users find offensive to their religion.
[01:09:03.904 --> 01:09:08.305]  That's right, they're going to let ISIS recruit, but they're going to censor your free speech.
[01:09:08.905 --> 01:09:15.967]  In France, if you criticize gays, you'll be arrested, basically, but Charlie Hebdo can do whatever it wants.
[01:09:16.027 --> 01:09:19.468]  It's all about stirring up trouble and selectively allowing free speech.
[01:09:19.928 --> 01:09:23.449]  I will break down my take on the dead king in Saudi Arabia, what that means.
[01:09:23.790 --> 01:09:28.291]  They're calling it a worst-case scenario, Yemen chaos, as that government collapses.
[01:09:29.091 --> 01:09:31.352]  Saudi King's death poses new challenges for U.S.
[01:09:31.473 --> 01:09:33.974]  I'm going to take calls, though, to the bottom of the hour.
[01:09:34.775 --> 01:09:39.417]  Then I'll continue with calls into the third hour, but I want to get into this breakdown video.
[01:09:39.557 --> 01:09:43.340]  UFC star tased, arrested after asking cops for ID.
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:51.805]  Now, I can show you video clips that are online of police doing a great job, but those don't get any attention.
[01:09:54.062 --> 01:09:59.884]  And I can show you clips of police doing absolutely horrible things all day long and that will go viral.
[01:10:02.585 --> 01:10:07.447]  But I'm going to show this clip and break it down because it shows both sides of it.
[01:10:07.968 --> 01:10:09.588]  Both sides fearing each other.
[01:10:11.009 --> 01:10:16.051]  And within this clip, within this story, you really understand what's happening.
[01:10:17.662 --> 01:10:21.185]  So it's my wish to not have a civil war.
[01:10:21.225 --> 01:10:23.106]  It's my wish to bring people together.
[01:10:23.626 --> 01:10:32.593]  It's my wish for folks to understand the larger social engineering manipulation that is admittedly afoot so that we can transcend this and not be chumps.
[01:10:34.514 --> 01:10:41.759]  Whether you're a guy pulled over with your wife and child by the police or whether you're the police themselves.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:46.663]  I got pulled over by the state police once by this male and female state troopers.
[01:10:47.915 --> 01:10:50.297]  I was going like five miles over the speed limit, driving to the beach.
[01:10:52.119 --> 01:10:58.784]  And when they came over, they were bugging their eyes out and going, is that child, that's, you know, are these kids buckled in correctly?
[01:10:58.804 --> 01:10:59.825]  And bugging their eyes out.
[01:10:59.845 --> 01:11:01.707]  I was like, what are you bugging your eyes out at me for?
[01:11:02.127 --> 01:11:03.508]  You're really acting aggressive and weird.
[01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:05.250]  Did I match some description?
[01:11:06.711 --> 01:11:08.272]  And they got all upset and wrote me a ticket.
[01:11:08.713 --> 01:11:14.538]  I mean, you've got some mentally ill people out there that are police officers, but you've got mentally ill people everywhere.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:20.405]  But I'm talking about how the system wants to exacerbate this coming up.
[01:11:21.146 --> 01:11:23.749]  Because you could look at this and see both sides of it.
[01:11:23.769 --> 01:11:28.795]  The UFC guy doesn't pull over for three miles, wants to get to a lighted place, which they say do.
[01:11:29.016 --> 01:11:30.377]  There's all these fake cops out there.
[01:11:31.238 --> 01:11:32.520]  Then he wants to see their IDs.
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:33.641]  They get real aggressive and won't.
[01:11:34.022 --> 01:11:34.663]  They taser him.
[01:11:37.284 --> 01:11:40.266]  And it's all on video, his wife shoots him and they charge him with assaulting him.
[01:11:40.767 --> 01:11:48.713]  And that's where the cops go from it being, you can see both positions, to the cops being very bad people.
[01:11:49.354 --> 01:12:01.143]  That they just think by default, you made me taser you, you argued with me for about two seconds, and so I'm not just going to taser you to make me in the right, I'm going to try to put you in jail.
[01:12:01.663 --> 01:12:05.827]  Oh, and I'm going to bring CPS in and try to take your kid away, saying you endangered a child.
[01:12:09.102 --> 01:12:10.822]  That's where you're going to get disrespected.
[01:12:11.302 --> 01:12:13.503]  That's where you're going to end up being seen as the enemy.
[01:12:13.903 --> 01:12:17.904]  And that's why so many people then begin to see the police as a predatory force.
[01:12:18.384 --> 01:12:19.584]  And this is all part of the plans.
[01:12:19.604 --> 01:12:21.124]  I'm going to break that down at the bottom of the hour.
[01:12:22.305 --> 01:12:24.325]  Stefan in New York, thanks for holding.
[01:12:24.345 --> 01:12:24.945]  You're on the air.
[01:12:26.346 --> 01:12:27.186]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:12:27.826 --> 01:12:31.427]  Oh man, I wish I wasn't at work right now because it's always such an honor to talk to you.
[01:12:31.447 --> 01:12:33.367]  Because to be honest, guys like you, you guys are
[01:12:34.159 --> 01:12:39.463]  You guys are heaven sent because of how successful you really brought the show.
[01:12:39.483 --> 01:12:49.731]  I mean, don't get me wrong, you're always telling people, you know, it's not me who's the only one out there, but you know, fortunately, you've driven it to a point where you have the millions of views you do, so...
[01:12:50.606 --> 01:12:54.490]  I hate to compliment you, because I know you don't like it, because then you feel, you know... Well, no, brother.
[01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:58.795]  It's just that everybody does it, and the show's not about me getting complimented all day.
[01:12:58.835 --> 01:13:04.561]  We're all in a battle together, trying to take the hill back from the enemy, and so we can all pat each other on the back.
[01:13:05.522 --> 01:13:10.608]  I mean, basically, to quote Pulp Fiction, you know, the wolf says, hey, let's not start celebrating yet.
[01:13:10.648 --> 01:13:11.649]  Let's get the job done here.
[01:13:13.551 --> 01:13:15.093]  I know exactly what Corey's talking about.
[01:13:15.113 --> 01:13:15.734]  Yeah, don't say it.
[01:13:15.754 --> 01:13:17.917]  I won't, I won't, I won't.
[01:13:17.937 --> 01:13:18.618]  That was good.
[01:13:19.098 --> 01:13:21.702]  But I have a few questions for you.
[01:13:21.742 --> 01:13:24.886]  First, I want you to go, first just give me a quick yes or no answer.
[01:13:25.879 --> 01:13:50.815]  The thumbprint on the iPhone, I feel like we're all sending our thumbprints down as they... Yeah, I told people 20 years ago they would phase it in, and then it would be voluntary, then it'll be mandatory, and they're gonna get rid of cash, and track everything you do, and control everything you do, and shut down any underground economies, and then raise taxes and regulations selectively, with the total computer algorithm systems, to bankrupt everyone that's on a globalist corporation.
[01:13:51.115 --> 01:14:00.938]  Then they'll make you waive all your rights to have a job or be on welfare, and then we're total slaves under a technocracy plan to phase in population reduction and final extermination.
[01:14:02.159 --> 01:14:03.819]  Right, and how thick is it?
[01:14:03.839 --> 01:14:08.221]  Because at first people used to think you're crazy for talking about it, but now it's just so thick.
[01:14:08.241 --> 01:14:15.263]  Well, that's why we had to say it when people thought it was 1984 and that'll never happen, so that we'd have credibility once it happened.
[01:14:16.474 --> 01:14:21.715]  So that's why I didn't mind being attacked by CNN and MSNBC and basically everybody else on the planet.
[01:14:22.015 --> 01:14:32.798]  You know, he says there's going to be brain chips, and he says you'll face cannabine cell, and he says blimps are looking at your heat resonance signature, and he says there's cancer viruses in the vaccines, and he says GMO sterilizes you.
[01:14:33.098 --> 01:14:34.599]  It was all public already.
[01:14:34.919 --> 01:14:38.620]  It was only in research papers, not for public distribution.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.380]  We had to decompartmentalize
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:40.980]  And you know what?
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.121]  I'm glad you held it together because you were just waiting for it to reach the surface.
[01:14:44.201 --> 01:14:46.021]  But now, obviously, it's getting closer to the surface.
[01:14:46.061 --> 01:14:47.021]  See, if you were weak
[01:15:05.154 --> 01:15:08.437]  You would have, you know, you would have been like, alright, you know what, maybe I am freaking crazy.
[01:15:08.797 --> 01:15:14.222]  And you would have let the comments... Except I was reading stuff written by the top scientists.
[01:15:15.122 --> 01:15:17.364]  I mean, I knew I was right because it was public.
[01:15:18.645 --> 01:15:30.415]  I knew it was right because my dad was the top of his class and one of the top scorers in Texas and they called him into a room and said, we're setting up a planetary world government of eugenics and we're getting the top people, we'd like you to join us.
[01:15:31.636 --> 01:15:33.218]  I mean, this is real, folks.
[01:15:35.356 --> 01:15:36.317]  Oh absolutely, absolutely.
[01:15:36.337 --> 01:15:36.537]  Go ahead.
[01:15:36.997 --> 01:15:49.544]  And I'm always very curious about, like, these people who always approach, you know, whether it's the Justin Bieber's or it's the people who approach people like your father, what organization do they typically belong to?
[01:15:49.644 --> 01:16:00.871]  I mean, I always picture some guy with sunglasses and a suit saying, hey listen, this is how it's gonna go, this is the direction the wind's gonna blow, so if you wanna, you know, stay famous and keep the name, then this is how it works.
[01:16:01.231 --> 01:16:05.033]  Or if you wanna, you know, if you're a scientist, and a lot of the times,
[01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:11.835]  It's funny, I try explaining to people and they're like, wait, you mean like Rockefeller and all these guys are geniuses?
[01:16:11.855 --> 01:16:13.236]  They're really thinking of all these solutions?
[01:16:13.296 --> 01:16:16.519]  I'm like, no, they just have the money to buy the genius brain.
[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:23.926]  And they developed systems that were developed back in Rome and just built on to manage and control populations, absolutely.
[01:16:24.406 --> 01:16:27.669]  You asked how do they control people, they do it a hundred different ways plus.
[01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:40.732]  Napoleon famously wrote, to paraphrase, that the most gallant men will give up their lives and throw themselves onto swords and spears and run into cannon fire for small little pieces of metal and ribbon.
[01:16:41.452 --> 01:16:55.435]  He basically rolled out, not just giving commendations to whole squads, like the Romans would do, they have awards to different cohorts and different groups of a hundred under a centurion.
[01:16:56.547 --> 01:16:58.627]  They began to hand out medals to individuals.
[01:16:59.327 --> 01:17:01.208]  So that's a form of prestige.
[01:17:01.948 --> 01:17:06.229]  Most people just get into power structure because they're yes-men and will follow whatever they're told.
[01:17:06.649 --> 01:17:07.749]  So they're compartmentalized.
[01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:09.989]  They're not needed to be given the full paradigm.
[01:17:11.730 --> 01:17:13.830]  If you want to know... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:17.991]  No, I was just going to say, you can see the ones that are controlled.
[01:17:18.031 --> 01:17:21.471]  They always come in the most weasel-y looking ways, like Ruber.
[01:17:21.671 --> 01:17:24.712]  Just these weasel-y type kinds of people.
[01:17:24.772 --> 01:17:25.352]  You can always...
[01:17:25.993 --> 01:17:30.315]  You can tell who's the heroes and who's just someone under someone else's thumb.
[01:17:30.455 --> 01:17:32.735]  And you see the faces like, Ruber, you listen to the voice.
[01:17:32.755 --> 01:17:33.036]  Well, sure.
[01:17:33.176 --> 01:17:35.376]  I mean, if you're conscious, certainly there's discernment.
[01:17:35.396 --> 01:17:35.897]  That's part of it.
[01:17:36.177 --> 01:17:37.277]  But listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:17:37.537 --> 01:17:38.658]  Let me try to answer your question.
[01:17:40.418 --> 01:17:41.479]  It's a very good question.
[01:17:43.539 --> 01:17:50.282]  I mean, you could have a PhD degree in all the facets of controlling populations and social engineering, the different layers of it.
[01:17:52.273 --> 01:18:02.257]  I've talked to a bunch of top rock stars, top hip-hop people, a lot of it on record, major movie stars, on record, and I've experienced it.
[01:18:02.357 --> 01:18:11.040]  I mean, a lot of it is Mark Cuban, who owns hockey teams and basketball teams, decides to put loose change out in movie theaters.
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:12.541]  A thousand screens.
[01:18:13.261 --> 01:18:18.383]  The White House called him and emailed him, and that went public with the New York Times a year later, after I'd told people what happened.
[01:18:19.588 --> 01:18:21.109]  And they said, we're going to put you in prison.
[01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:23.691]  He said, well, come on, it's the First Amendment.
[01:18:23.711 --> 01:18:27.494]  They said, listen, we're going to indict you for insider trading, which you clearly didn't do.
[01:18:27.514 --> 01:18:30.075]  It was some small amount, like Martha Stewart.
[01:18:31.977 --> 01:18:38.641]  And even when he dropped the film and backed off, they still went after him and indicted him.
[01:18:38.681 --> 01:18:39.482]  And he beat them once.
[01:18:39.602 --> 01:18:40.443]  They came after him again.
[01:18:40.703 --> 01:18:42.544]  He's still fighting them today.
[01:18:43.845 --> 01:18:46.207]  And I'm not at liberty to say the other stuff they did to him.
[01:18:46.991 --> 01:18:55.695]  But let me tell you, if you're worth four or five billion dollars and you're a smart guy like Mark Cuban, they come after you.
[01:18:58.576 --> 01:19:07.741]  And they have weird rules, because the fact that he sold out to Yahoo, and they see that as the establishment, the fact that he's so rich he's part of the club, they just consider him open game.
[01:19:08.321 --> 01:19:08.781]  Fair game.
[01:19:09.641 --> 01:19:12.683]  The fact that I've never worked with the system or taken money from them,
[01:19:13.792 --> 01:19:17.756]  It's like I'm metaphysically outside of their realm and I'm protected to a certain extent.
[01:19:19.718 --> 01:19:21.500]  So you ask a question that's so complex.
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:22.541]  I mean, here's another example.
[01:19:26.064 --> 01:19:28.907]  Chris Carter and the crew of X-Files got approached by the CIA.
[01:19:30.416 --> 01:19:38.522]  A year before 9-11, and they said, we want you to make a show about hijacked jets flown to the World Trade Center to create martial law and attack Afghanistan.
[01:19:38.822 --> 01:19:46.807]  It's really the government doing it during a drill where they use an anti-terror drill to make the computers lock down and they release gas on the plane and then blame it on Al Qaeda.
[01:19:48.468 --> 01:19:49.089]  And they said, why?
[01:19:49.109 --> 01:19:50.070]  They just said, do it.
[01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:52.771]  And a lot of their themes were from the CIA.
[01:19:54.122 --> 01:20:08.628]  And it's a metaphysical rule that by them putting it out, they gained more, and I don't believe this, they believe it, interdimensional power, and it gave their real event more favor, that it would then be successful.
[01:20:11.055 --> 01:20:12.616]  Time and time again.
[01:20:12.636 --> 01:20:15.498]  You need to come here and help us.
[01:20:15.598 --> 01:20:16.678]  We need assistance.
[01:20:17.039 --> 01:20:17.579]  Please!
[01:20:17.839 --> 01:20:21.161]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[01:20:21.421 --> 01:20:27.525]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[01:20:27.825 --> 01:20:30.166]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[01:23:09.011 --> 01:23:15.213]  Usually the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[01:23:15.753 --> 01:23:19.534]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[01:23:20.154 --> 01:23:23.115]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[01:23:23.656 --> 01:23:24.236]  Not fun!
[01:23:24.796 --> 01:23:32.598]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[01:23:33.178 --> 01:23:37.940]  One World Whey is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.100]  My name is Errol.
[01:23:39.441 --> 01:23:40.781]  I'm 74 years old.
[01:23:40.981 --> 01:23:43.382]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[01:23:43.542 --> 01:23:51.026]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your trace mineral supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[01:23:51.406 --> 01:23:57.469]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[01:23:57.709 --> 01:23:58.149]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.369]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:58.389 --> 01:23:59.590]  Or visit oneworldwhey.com.
[01:24:10.287 --> 01:24:13.949]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[01:24:14.449 --> 01:24:21.513]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[01:24:22.114 --> 01:24:25.656]  That's what the Davos Switzerland crew of Globalist are saying.
[01:24:25.696 --> 01:24:36.782]  It's like Bilderberg, but a public meeting, openly announcing world government, panopticon surveillance, gamed economies, the end of the family, just a hellish vision.
[01:24:37.904 --> 01:24:41.165]  But humanity never stands up until things get really dark.
[01:24:41.766 --> 01:24:45.707]  The problem is the globalists are very good at creeping around and doing things by stealth.
[01:24:46.508 --> 01:24:47.668]  And that's our biggest problem.
[01:24:48.188 --> 01:25:01.594]  Next segment I'm going to break down as best I can because I was on the elliptical this morning and I just watched this video earlier and I was upset about it and I didn't know how to approach it and I was thinking about all the different angles
[01:25:03.985 --> 01:25:05.325]  And then it became so clear to me.
[01:25:05.905 --> 01:25:13.927]  I'm going to try to summon that thought process back and try to see if I can communicate it coming up in the next segment, then we'll go back to the calls.
[01:25:13.967 --> 01:25:16.727]  But right now, Kevin in West Virginia, thanks for holding.
[01:25:17.027 --> 01:25:17.667]  You're on the air.
[01:25:17.787 --> 01:25:18.127]  Welcome.
[01:25:19.528 --> 01:25:20.388]  Hi, Alex.
[01:25:20.568 --> 01:25:27.469]  I was wondering if, I'm sure you've heard of the C&O Canal over here in West Virginia, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal.
[01:25:27.769 --> 01:25:28.929]  Yes.
[01:25:29.429 --> 01:25:33.330]  They are starting to make legislation where they're going to start
[01:25:33.945 --> 01:25:37.513]  Charging people to get on the canal or on the towpath.
[01:25:38.315 --> 01:25:40.460]  My question then is, is this
[01:25:40.985 --> 01:25:43.988]  Another way of them land grabbing?
[01:25:44.188 --> 01:25:49.032]  Or is this another way for them to put armed DNR people?
[01:25:49.192 --> 01:25:49.772]  It's everything.
[01:25:49.832 --> 01:25:56.418]  It's Agenda 21, where all the waterways are being declared federal, even though they were built by the states or counties or cities.
[01:25:56.998 --> 01:26:00.041]  In the case of your famous canal that was used before they had highways.
[01:26:01.122 --> 01:26:02.163]  And they're just seizing them.
[01:26:02.643 --> 01:26:08.408]  The Red River, they're announcing hundreds of thousands of acres on both sides that are owned by private people.
[01:26:08.908 --> 01:26:12.796]  The Feds are just seizing it under piratical edict.
[01:26:14.419 --> 01:26:15.461]  This is not the Feds.
[01:26:15.501 --> 01:26:17.184]  This is happening all over the world.
[01:26:18.421 --> 01:26:26.704]  Where, it's a very good question, I'm glad you raised this, where they're announcing buffer zone on each side of any creek or river or waterway.
[01:26:27.024 --> 01:26:30.666]  Now they're announcing, as you've heard, puddles on property or wetlands.
[01:26:31.306 --> 01:26:32.927]  And so regulatory fines are coming in.
[01:26:32.967 --> 01:26:36.688]  And then, take Austin, Texas, that is implementing all of this.
[01:26:36.748 --> 01:26:40.450]  It's a model, it's a munialized city in a U.N.
[01:26:40.530 --> 01:26:41.450]  sub-treaty agreement.
[01:26:42.170 --> 01:26:43.611]  We have a sister city in Japan.
[01:26:44.671 --> 01:26:45.252]  And the U.N.
[01:26:45.292 --> 01:26:47.673]  actually calls the shots more than the Feds here in Austin.
[01:26:48.073 --> 01:26:48.914]  And that's all public.
[01:26:49.494 --> 01:26:51.416]  It's just the general public isn't aware of it.
[01:26:52.556 --> 01:26:59.841]  And they're now announcing they're going to start charging for all the boat dock ramps to put your boat in and out on Lake Travis or in Austin.
[01:27:00.622 --> 01:27:02.883]  Lake Austin, which is really just the Colorado River dammed.
[01:27:03.944 --> 01:27:06.105]  And they're going to start charging you to swim in any lakes or anything.
[01:27:06.265 --> 01:27:07.646]  This is all being phased in right now.
[01:27:12.029 --> 01:27:16.453]  The TV news, I saw KXAN had the headline, to raise money.
[01:27:16.654 --> 01:27:18.615]  The city is flooded with money.
[01:27:19.196 --> 01:27:22.279]  Just ultra-rich with huge property taxes and everything.
[01:27:22.599 --> 01:27:25.462]  And it's all about, you don't get to use any of the public lands.
[01:27:25.922 --> 01:27:26.863]  You're going to pay for it.
[01:27:27.224 --> 01:27:31.408]  So they can festoon more... I mean, here I am saying I don't want to bash police.
[01:27:32.248 --> 01:27:36.612]  But I was out on Lake Austin with my buddy Shane Steiner last year, with my kids and his kids.
[01:27:37.632 --> 01:27:38.673]  There was hardly anybody out there.
[01:27:38.693 --> 01:27:39.953]  I played hooky skip one day.
[01:27:39.973 --> 01:27:42.414]  We were out there wakeboarding and surfing.
[01:27:42.994 --> 01:27:43.575]  Wake surfing.
[01:27:44.555 --> 01:27:45.015]  I wasn't.
[01:27:45.235 --> 01:27:46.816]  I always hurt my back when I do it.
[01:27:46.856 --> 01:27:47.356]  He was doing it.
[01:27:47.617 --> 01:27:48.457]  And my kids were doing it.
[01:27:49.978 --> 01:27:55.940]  And here comes these guys in bulletproof vests and they were pulling over boats and pulling over kayaks and really getting in people's faces.
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:58.742]  They started pulling up to us, bugging their eyes out behind us.
[01:27:58.822 --> 01:28:00.883]  I just bugged my eyes out back, started laughing at them.
[01:28:01.303 --> 01:28:02.543]  And they laughed and pulled off.
[01:28:02.583 --> 01:28:05.605]  But I mean, that's not how a peace officer acts.
[01:28:08.266 --> 01:28:09.808]  It almost makes you not want to go on the lake.
[01:28:11.089 --> 01:28:12.811]  You know, you get treated like such trash.
[01:28:13.952 --> 01:28:20.279]  But, again, the Austin PD doesn't act imperious like that on average, so it's kind of an oasis.
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:21.921]  There are some problems.
[01:28:22.381 --> 01:28:27.264]  But like Arne Saavedra said, at least our police don't shoot unarmed people on a routine basis in the back.
[01:28:27.584 --> 01:28:30.045]  Then he got criticized by police unions saying, what do you mean?
[01:28:30.406 --> 01:28:31.166]  Well, I mean, come on.
[01:28:31.206 --> 01:28:32.287]  You see these cop videos.
[01:28:32.347 --> 01:28:32.847]  It's scary.
[01:28:33.127 --> 01:28:36.949]  And sure, it's a minority that's doing it, but it's being protected.
[01:28:36.989 --> 01:28:37.710]  But I'm ranting.
[01:28:37.730 --> 01:28:38.030]  Go ahead.
[01:28:39.899 --> 01:28:41.781]  I just don't quite understand.
[01:28:41.801 --> 01:28:48.846]  I mean, I guess... Well, listen, slave, you're not just gonna go, you know, scan your driver's license and go pay a bunch of money for a license to go fish.
[01:28:48.866 --> 01:28:53.149]  You're gonna pay on top of that, and you're gonna register your kayak, and you're gonna get harassed.
[01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:53.490]  Go ahead.
[01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.710]  Sorry.
[01:28:55.140 --> 01:29:00.624]  I mean, it's just, you know, I'm 30 years old and I've never had to pay to go on a canal.
[01:29:00.664 --> 01:29:03.346]  And like you said, I kayak and I fish.
[01:29:03.406 --> 01:29:08.149]  I mean, there's not a lot of stuff for a visually impaired... Oh, they're now making you buy registration to kayak.
[01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:12.832]  And they're now making you, in many states, pay a registration filing fee to have a surfboard.
[01:29:13.453 --> 01:29:15.915]  And soon it'll be a registration to wipe your ass.
[01:29:15.995 --> 01:29:16.435]  Excuse me.
[01:29:16.755 --> 01:29:17.836]  Excuse me, God, forgive me.
[01:29:17.876 --> 01:29:18.957]  I'm going to get so mad.
[01:29:19.217 --> 01:29:20.298]  I'm trying to be calm today.
[01:29:20.598 --> 01:29:21.739]  This isn't freedom.
[01:29:22.723 --> 01:29:25.487]  And see, we're getting mad about it and just blaming the cops.
[01:29:25.847 --> 01:29:28.531]  We need to blame ourselves and the legislatures and the systems.
[01:29:29.432 --> 01:29:31.114]  And then when we're done with them, we can blame the cops.
[01:29:31.154 --> 01:29:34.999]  But they're the last group in the culpability stream.
[01:29:35.999 --> 01:29:40.943]  They at least have to go out and enforce all this unconstitutional crud, and they should be upset about it.
[01:29:41.404 --> 01:29:44.606]  And you should be upset, and you are, and God bless you, and I salute you.
[01:29:44.746 --> 01:29:46.187]  That's why I don't want to hear you thank me.
[01:29:46.388 --> 01:29:50.071]  I want to thank you for caring, and not being these zombies out here.
[01:29:50.671 --> 01:29:55.155]  I want to thank our affiliates for caring about freedom and having huevos to carry this broadcast.
[01:29:57.287 --> 01:29:59.389]  This is about having a spine, people.
[01:29:59.409 --> 01:30:00.190]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.691 --> 01:30:02.273]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.293 --> 01:30:05.897]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:10.572 --> 01:31:11.473]  Alex Jones here.
[01:31:11.573 --> 01:31:20.518]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.

[01:32:11.175 --> 01:32:15.157]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your Supramel.
[01:32:15.217 --> 01:32:17.137]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[01:32:17.197 --> 01:32:19.879]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.
[01:32:20.159 --> 01:32:22.600]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:24.140]  You've heard the callers to the show.
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:25.301]  Your products are great.

[01:32:52.155 --> 01:32:52.895]  That's true.

[01:32:57.759 --> 01:32:58.559]  It's great stuff.

[01:33:28.401 --> 01:33:29.601]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:30.081 --> 01:33:35.862]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.403 --> 01:33:38.863]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:38.983 --> 01:33:40.163]  to 2 p.m., we're here live.
[01:33:41.243 --> 01:33:43.744]  Weeknight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:33:44.344 --> 01:33:49.825]  Find listings and more details at InfoWars.com forward slash show or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:52.568 --> 01:33:56.889]  I'm going to continue with Harry and Jay and Regina.
[01:33:57.429 --> 01:33:58.650]  Regina's actually up next.
[01:33:58.750 --> 01:34:07.112]  Kelly and Ron, we're going to get to all of you after I really try to communicate to the police and the public out there.
[01:34:09.573 --> 01:34:17.095]  I see some comments on Infowars.com and on our YouTube videos that say, what's going on with this site?
[01:34:17.155 --> 01:34:18.576]  Are you schizophrenic, Alex?
[01:34:20.063 --> 01:34:22.984]  You got articles about good cops and good things they're doing.
[01:34:23.004 --> 01:34:25.645]  You got articles about bad cops and bad things they're doing.
[01:34:26.865 --> 01:34:29.886]  I see comments like, alright pigs, you're gonna get it.
[01:34:29.926 --> 01:34:31.546]  Pretty soon you're gonna start dying.
[01:34:33.707 --> 01:34:36.308]  And Jones needs to quit brown-nosing the police.
[01:34:38.789 --> 01:34:43.730]  And then I see cops on there going, I'm a police officer and I back what this officer did.
[01:34:43.770 --> 01:34:46.491]  That guy should have followed that order immediately.
[01:34:47.511 --> 01:34:49.732]  And you just see how we're being manipulated.
[01:34:56.857 --> 01:35:02.140]  It's a very complex issue, but this at its base is what's happening.
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:06.242]  We do have a usurped federal government taken over by foreign interest.
[01:35:06.322 --> 01:35:10.404]  It is occupied by the classical definition, we're going into global government.
[01:35:12.205 --> 01:35:13.666]  And the average yuppie goes, so what?
[01:35:13.686 --> 01:35:14.647]  That's the natural pattern.
[01:35:14.827 --> 01:35:16.368]  Look at Star Trek, there's a global government.
[01:35:16.568 --> 01:35:20.370]  Yeah, you've been pre-programmed with television and media that that's where it's going.
[01:35:20.670 --> 01:35:22.311]  It's a bad world government.
[01:35:23.439 --> 01:35:38.589]  We had a World Government Federation where people voted and opted in to make decisions and the countries agreed and didn't violate their sovereignty on joint projects and things like space bases, underwater bases, railroads, bullet trains.
[01:35:38.949 --> 01:35:39.250]  Sure.
[01:35:41.011 --> 01:35:41.811]  Aid projects.
[01:35:42.171 --> 01:35:43.753]  But that's not what it is.
[01:35:44.413 --> 01:35:47.655]  The global government's run by social Darwinists.
[01:35:48.035 --> 01:35:48.876]  In their words.
[01:35:50.597 --> 01:35:52.158]  Guys, give me the definition of a social Darwinist.
[01:35:52.178 --> 01:35:53.199]  I want to put that up on screen.
[01:35:54.875 --> 01:35:55.936]  These are bad people.
[01:35:56.616 --> 01:35:58.937]  So, I oppose its agenda.
[01:35:59.017 --> 01:36:06.562]  I don't care how flowery or how great it sounds, because I know what their endgame is, and I've seen what they do with captured populations, and it ain't pretty.
[01:36:07.398 --> 01:36:09.360]  When they got somebody under their will, it's over.
[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:25.195]  Social Darwinism is a modern name given to various theories of society that emerged in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Western Europe in the 1870s, and which are claimed to have applied biological concepts of nature, selection, and survival of the fittest to sociology and politics.
[01:36:27.497 --> 01:36:31.842]  In short, it's eugenics, or it's, I got a right to kill you, because I'm in charge.
[01:36:32.796 --> 01:36:39.542]  I got a right to poison you and dumb you down to make you more manageable because I was in that position to begin with, but I'm going to tell you I'm trying to help you.
[01:36:42.784 --> 01:36:47.008]  See, I wouldn't have a problem with them being honest and saying they're taking over.
[01:36:47.068 --> 01:36:47.769]  I'd fight them.
[01:36:48.729 --> 01:36:51.492]  If they admitted it and warned everybody and it was a fair fight.
[01:36:53.356 --> 01:37:06.303]  Many such views stress competition between individuals and laissez-faire capitalism, while others motivated ideas of eugenics, racism, imperialism, fascism, Nazism, the struggle between natural or racial groups.
[01:37:06.343 --> 01:37:11.445]  Yeah, the Nazi angle of it took over and didn't want competition.
[01:37:12.626 --> 01:37:20.090]  Early on it said, let's have competition and then that'll decide who's successful, but then they just got rid of that entirely.
[01:37:21.547 --> 01:37:28.551]  So there are some truths to eugenics, at least as its base rolled out.
[01:37:29.471 --> 01:37:37.536]  But there's the public pop eugenics of we just want to make the races better, and then there's the real eugenics that it's social engineering.
[01:37:39.221 --> 01:37:43.785]  So that said, the public knows there's a great evil brewing.
[01:37:44.445 --> 01:38:04.541]  Even if you're in a fog of GMO and fluoride and aspartame and MSG and television and spectator-induced neurons where people are unable to act or take action or even engage in self-preservation because of their learned helplessness, mass Stockholm Syndrome, normalcy bias.
[01:38:06.903 --> 01:38:08.223]  Those are all key words, folks.
[01:38:08.243 --> 01:38:09.404]  Look them up if you're a new listener.
[01:38:11.845 --> 01:38:14.226]  They count on that normalcy bias all day long.
[01:38:14.266 --> 01:38:20.548]  And they count on your fear mechanism and a mass Stockholm Syndrome to believe you don't have power and that you couldn't oppose something, so you roll over.
[01:38:21.048 --> 01:38:23.249]  Which, when you roll over, your body starts to die.
[01:38:24.309 --> 01:38:24.890]  They have studies.
[01:38:25.110 --> 01:38:27.010]  Literally, your neurons start falling apart.
[01:38:27.490 --> 01:38:30.812]  Literally, your cells start dividing faster.
[01:38:30.832 --> 01:38:31.452]  You just give up.
[01:38:34.141 --> 01:38:34.641]  You give up.
[01:38:35.282 --> 01:38:38.465]  Because you're genetically not meant to operate if you've given up.
[01:38:41.688 --> 01:38:42.349]  I'm not giving up.
[01:38:43.210 --> 01:38:47.334]  Because at least my spirit and my soul, this energy, is going to go on.
[01:38:48.094 --> 01:38:52.819]  Even if the globalists successfully take over and get most of their plans through, humanity will rise again.
[01:38:52.839 --> 01:38:57.443]  I know that in my gut, and I know it spiritually, and this is the great challenge.
[01:38:57.483 --> 01:38:59.165]  And out of this ultimate challenge,
[01:39:00.438 --> 01:39:02.099]  Can we decipher the enemy program?
[01:39:02.139 --> 01:39:02.879]  Can we defeat it?
[01:39:03.159 --> 01:39:04.080]  Can we rise above it?
[01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:10.864]  If we can do that with love and passion, but with the will to violently oppose tyrants.
[01:39:11.564 --> 01:39:16.226]  And by violently, I mean violently with words and deed and physically in defense.
[01:39:17.667 --> 01:39:21.769]  Best part of American Sniper, something I heard growing up from my grandfathers.
[01:39:22.170 --> 01:39:26.452]  That's an old Texas speech, or I just know I was given it by both grandfathers.
[01:39:28.968 --> 01:39:35.669]  Where the dad's sitting there talking to Chris Collin, his brother, and saying, you know, the guy was beating up your brother today at school, good job you, you know, took him on.
[01:39:38.330 --> 01:39:44.091]  And you got wolves out there that want to feed on innocent people, and if I ever catch you doing that, I'm gonna, you know, beat the daylights out of you.
[01:39:45.631 --> 01:39:48.571]  But the sheep, when violence comes to their door, just roll over to the wolves.
[01:39:48.851 --> 01:39:50.252]  We're not sheep, we're sheepdogs.
[01:39:51.092 --> 01:39:52.972]  And that's absolutely what it's all about.
[01:39:53.252 --> 01:39:58.653]  But they've taken the sheepdog instinct, and really they're trying to turn police into wolves right now.
[01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:08.642]  Because a sheepdog is really just a domesticated wolf, beefed up with long hair so it can take more bites, and big jaws to crush wolves.
[01:40:10.822 --> 01:40:14.503]  And it's really easy to flip a switch with training and turn a sheepdog into a wolf.
[01:40:14.943 --> 01:40:16.063]  Because they're very close.
[01:40:18.924 --> 01:40:22.065]  That's why love and hate really are so close.
[01:40:23.485 --> 01:40:25.205]  Indifference is the opposite of love.
[01:40:27.586 --> 01:40:29.146]  Indifference is the opposite of love.
[01:40:31.992 --> 01:40:35.054]  See, when you're indifferent about the world, you don't love yourself, you don't love anybody.
[01:40:35.294 --> 01:40:36.615]  When you're not in the game, you've given up.
[01:40:37.355 --> 01:40:38.536]  And God's gonna give up on you.
[01:40:39.396 --> 01:40:40.977]  You think you have power giving up?
[01:40:41.678 --> 01:40:42.938]  No, you have weakness giving up.
[01:40:43.939 --> 01:40:49.822]  Just like if you go on a Mars mission, and your body's gonna fall apart because there's no G-forces.
[01:40:50.963 --> 01:40:52.864]  Well, that sounds fun, I just lay on my back the whole time.
[01:40:52.924 --> 01:41:00.889]  No, you fall apart, your heart falls apart, your body falls apart, you age 20 years in one year on a mission to Mars because you don't have any gravity.
[01:41:03.908 --> 01:41:09.049]  And being lazy, watching TV all day, watching SportsCenter, not caring, going along with the system.
[01:41:09.429 --> 01:41:11.670]  Spiritually, there's no G-forces.
[01:41:11.890 --> 01:41:13.230]  You're falling apart.
[01:41:15.551 --> 01:41:17.971]  There's an old saying that pain is weakness leaving the body.
[01:41:18.371 --> 01:41:20.832]  Well, you need to go through some social pain.
[01:41:21.532 --> 01:41:29.514]  Until the point of, I could care less if national television says I'm behind the Boston bombing with no evidence, or the media comes out with huge lies, or I get
[01:41:30.487 --> 01:41:32.688]  Set up or even imprisoned, because it doesn't matter.
[01:41:32.748 --> 01:41:36.191]  My soul was pointed in the right direction.
[01:41:36.431 --> 01:41:37.231]  That's what matters.
[01:41:37.471 --> 01:41:39.573]  And deep down, I'm satisfied.
[01:41:39.833 --> 01:41:41.013]  The fear is gone.
[01:41:41.314 --> 01:41:43.155]  I'm now in the presence of God.
[01:41:44.536 --> 01:42:00.025]  As dirty as I am, and as rags are on my body, I now am in the spirit of the creator of the universe, and nothing they can do to me hurts me, because now I realize the whole goal was to keep me from ever realizing that, and to keep you from realizing that, and gaining that true salvation.
[01:42:04.687 --> 01:42:06.468]  They want your soul, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:08.389 --> 01:42:08.969]  That's real.
[01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:23.076]  As Revelation says, the high priest of the earth, the sorcerers of the New World Order, the sorcerers of the Antichrist, it depends on which Bible version you read, trafficked in the souls of men.
[01:42:24.857 --> 01:42:33.181]  They trafficked in the souls of men, and they ran around continually inventing new forms of evil.
[01:42:36.856 --> 01:42:40.939]  Nobody's getting my soul but the one that made it.
[01:42:44.402 --> 01:42:45.503]  You want to know how to defeat the New World Order?
[01:42:46.323 --> 01:42:50.887]  Just hit your knees tonight and just say, even if you're an atheist, whoever you are, just see what it does.
[01:42:50.907 --> 01:42:53.108]  Just say, God of the universe, show yourself to me.
[01:42:53.188 --> 01:42:53.729]  Change me.
[01:42:54.129 --> 01:42:54.829]  I know I'm weak.
[01:42:54.889 --> 01:42:55.430]  Make me better.
[01:42:55.490 --> 01:42:56.290]  Give me discernment.
[01:42:56.911 --> 01:42:58.032]  Fill me with your spirit.
[01:42:58.392 --> 01:43:02.015]  Give me the understanding I need to transcend this flesh.
[01:43:03.444 --> 01:43:04.826]  And the virus of the devil.
[01:43:05.246 --> 01:43:05.667]  That's what it is.
[01:43:05.787 --> 01:43:08.730]  Evil is a virus of malfunctioning twistedness.
[01:43:09.471 --> 01:43:11.473]  And Lord knows, folks, I'm not on some high horse.
[01:43:11.854 --> 01:43:15.418]  I've got an evil streak in me that the most evil people envy.
[01:43:15.438 --> 01:43:16.519]  Do you understand that?
[01:43:18.562 --> 01:43:21.025]  Evil sees in me everything they want to be.
[01:43:21.906 --> 01:43:23.428]  Because they would then use that.
[01:43:24.406 --> 01:43:25.747]  And you've got that in you as too.
[01:43:25.907 --> 01:43:33.473]  Look, good people are tougher, meaner, more vicious, and more base evil than the greatest of the enemy.
[01:43:35.294 --> 01:43:41.920]  But you sit there and don't believe you have power and won't turn yourself over to God, so you're not even in the game.
[01:43:44.722 --> 01:43:46.343]  Doesn't mean you're not going to make mistakes.
[01:43:46.383 --> 01:43:48.645]  Doesn't mean that you've got all the answers.
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:44:02.927]  It just means you got your soul pointed in the right direction and you love God, you love justice, you love the innocent, you love seeing people be successful when they did it by hard work.
[01:44:03.247 --> 01:44:05.068]  You're not an envious piece of garbage.
[01:44:06.789 --> 01:44:09.270]  And that you got a big heart, that's what God wants.
[01:44:09.290 --> 01:44:11.471]  Because God's got a big heart.
[01:44:12.112 --> 01:44:15.113]  And he told King David, you've got a heart like mine.
[01:44:15.754 --> 01:44:17.775]  Because you're made in the image of the Creator.
[01:44:19.758 --> 01:44:21.599]  We are mini-me's, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:21.819 --> 01:44:22.820]  You need to understand that.
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:31.766]  You need to understand how big that is, that we're made in the image of the entity that made this planet.
[01:44:33.147 --> 01:44:37.409]  And the enemy knows that and now wants to be God with all this technology and all this garbage.
[01:44:37.570 --> 01:44:38.930]  And I said I'd talk about the police.
[01:44:40.571 --> 01:44:45.555]  What I'm getting at here is the police have been militarized, put into a state of fear of the public.
[01:44:46.488 --> 01:44:50.272]  The public has been put into a state of fear of the system and knows it's illegitimate.
[01:44:50.712 --> 01:44:54.816]  And the interface they see is the police who are tasked to carry out the system.
[01:44:55.136 --> 01:44:56.518]  Much of their duty is legitimate.
[01:44:57.038 --> 01:45:00.461]  And part of the old republic, much of their duty is illegitimate.
[01:45:01.883 --> 01:45:10.471]  And so as they go into this militarized Fallujah-style training to quote, keep them safe, that will create more fear where a UFC fighter
[01:45:13.854 --> 01:45:15.356]  Gets pulled over by the police.
[01:45:16.296 --> 01:45:18.499]  He's got his flasher as long as his car's got problems.
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:22.743]  The cops are probably running his plates, gonna try to pull over and help him.
[01:45:24.434 --> 01:45:27.495]  He's paranoid because he's got a warrior instinct that hasn't developed.
[01:45:27.795 --> 01:45:29.815]  He sees all the bad stuff cops are doing on TV.
[01:45:30.115 --> 01:45:37.157]  He feels threatened with his wife and daughter, with his newborn that clicks his... I mean, when I first had a kid, the first six months or so, I was ready to fight anybody.
[01:45:37.377 --> 01:45:38.117]  It's a genetic thing.
[01:45:38.257 --> 01:45:39.757]  So it's this UFC guy all honed.
[01:45:40.377 --> 01:45:41.117]  The cops are behind him.
[01:45:41.137 --> 01:45:42.798]  He's got a baby that's about a month old.
[01:45:43.118 --> 01:45:46.659]  He's all jacked up with that adrenaline.
[01:45:46.859 --> 01:45:48.739]  He pulls into the gas station, gets out.
[01:45:49.119 --> 01:45:50.079]  They're little cops.
[01:45:50.099 --> 01:45:51.039]  He's this big guy.
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:52.840]  He walks over and says, I want a CID.
[01:45:53.888 --> 01:45:55.156]  That gets them all scared.
[01:45:56.616 --> 01:46:01.678]  They taser him, and then they go further and say he assaulted him.
[01:46:01.858 --> 01:46:06.580]  And you see the two cops on tape when the supervisor shows up, kind of going, oh, I didn't get it on tape.
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:09.381]  The squad car video wasn't on when he assaulted me.
[01:46:09.661 --> 01:46:10.201]  Well, guess what?
[01:46:10.241 --> 01:46:11.521]  The woman's got the video.
[01:46:11.602 --> 01:46:12.522]  He didn't assault you.
[01:46:12.902 --> 01:46:21.285]  And right there when you did that, you went from being somebody who was just scared and could have been more manly and said, hey, back off, Chief.
[01:46:21.485 --> 01:46:22.506]  We're just seeing if we need help.
[01:46:22.986 --> 01:46:24.006]  Stop acting like a jerk.
[01:46:24.246 --> 01:46:25.927]  And that UFC guy was going, oh, I'm sorry.
[01:46:26.587 --> 01:46:27.927]  Because, see, he's with his wife and kid.
[01:46:27.967 --> 01:46:28.587]  He's scared.
[01:46:28.808 --> 01:46:32.848]  He's been programmed by the media to fear you, just like you've been programmed to fear him.
[01:46:33.108 --> 01:46:39.310]  Like two morons being manipulated by George Soros and the New World Order, acting like fools.
[01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:48.652]  Instead, though, you went to the next level, and then you framed him, and you went from being somebody who was scared from somebody else who was scared, so he bowed up to you?
[01:46:49.502 --> 01:47:06.465]  To now committing the act of false witness, which is one of the greatest crimes you can commit, to try to now take this guy's kid from him, file charges of basically neglect of a child, that he did this in the presence of a child, when he did nothing, but say, give me some identification.
[01:47:07.566 --> 01:47:15.207]  So you tasered him because you've got to be in control of the situation, and now the cops are going to defend you because they're all circled the wagons.
[01:47:15.667 --> 01:47:18.248]  They're told civil war and economic collapse is coming.
[01:47:19.264 --> 01:47:21.405]  Because it's been engineered, they're not told that.
[01:47:22.466 --> 01:47:34.933]  And so we now are supposed to, in a laboratory event, give the police the resistance to finally commit them to seeing us as the enemy, and the journey towards the globalist takeover is complete.
[01:47:35.334 --> 01:47:47.241]  They can then start the civil war, wipe out much of the police and military and the patriot movement, and then bring in the next wave of social engineers and psyops as the solution to getting the electricity back on.
[01:47:48.430 --> 01:47:50.312]  And accepting the new global government.
[01:47:51.352 --> 01:48:04.903]  Now they might run this next year or ten years from now, but they're beta testing this program right now, and the fact that we're revealing it could stop them if people just understood that this is what's going on.
[01:48:07.285 --> 01:48:14.051]  So I have zero desire to sit here and play this whole video report that you can see unedited at InfoWars.com
[01:48:15.816 --> 01:48:19.779]  Video UFC star tased, arrested for asking cops for ID.
[01:48:21.741 --> 01:48:25.744]  And when citizens start killing cops, cops will start killing more citizens and vice versa.
[01:48:26.044 --> 01:48:28.826]  And it'll become an us against them, citizen against cop situation.
[01:48:29.167 --> 01:48:32.269]  And you'll end up having police and citizens that have the same mindset.
[01:48:33.090 --> 01:48:34.891]  Here's the article at InfoWars.com.
[01:48:34.951 --> 01:48:40.436]  Black man who tortured, executed two white teens makes Black Lives Matter speech at sentencing.
[01:48:42.257 --> 01:48:45.300]  Did the hands up, don't shoot, Black Lives Matter shtick
[01:48:46.343 --> 01:48:52.805]  When the family said, we forgive you for killing our sons, who were dumb enough to try to go into town to buy some drugs.
[01:48:52.825 --> 01:48:56.326]  He took them in a field with his buddy and tortured them to death, because they were white.
[01:48:56.786 --> 01:49:03.448]  And in his mind, it's okay, because the media hyped him up that cops and whites are killing black men.
[01:49:04.168 --> 01:49:06.929]  And so he's going to go now randomly kill two white people.
[01:49:08.249 --> 01:49:10.030]  This is exactly as stupid
[01:49:11.798 --> 01:49:24.228]  As the whole bandwagon that the police are all devils, or the police bandwagon that if someone asks you a question or says, hey, give me an ID, that you couldn't say, okay, fine, I'll give you an ID.
[01:49:25.869 --> 01:49:37.678]  Because a real man isn't scared to de-escalate things, and isn't scared to let somebody ten feet away act a little tough in front of him, if you haven't pulled him over and they don't have some big criminal record.
[01:49:39.045 --> 01:49:41.247]  You can see the cops are freaked out after they've tasered him.
[01:49:41.467 --> 01:49:43.569]  Now they've got to cover it up so they don't get in trouble.
[01:49:44.009 --> 01:49:45.230]  See, that's where he committed the crime.
[01:49:48.573 --> 01:49:52.115]  And I bet money if you'd apologize to that guy, he'd apologize back to you.
[01:49:52.416 --> 01:49:55.578]  There wouldn't have been a lawsuit out of it, and then you'd have grown to the next level.
[01:49:55.618 --> 01:50:01.183]  But even if there was a lawsuit out of it, and even if you end up losing your job, which you probably wouldn't have,
[01:50:02.026 --> 01:50:14.656]  You would feel better about yourself and have taken a step in the right direction, instead of the public all saying it's the cops' fault, and the cops saying it's all the public's fault, when we're all in this together, all being attacked by the globalists.
[01:50:16.938 --> 01:50:17.598]  It's very simple.
[01:50:19.319 --> 01:50:21.621]  And it's horrifying to see people all over the internet.
[01:50:22.742 --> 01:50:26.525]  I mean, the anti-police hatred in this country has been whipped up and whipped up.
[01:50:26.605 --> 01:50:27.606]  It's across the board.
[01:50:27.906 --> 01:50:28.627]  It's growing.
[01:50:32.085 --> 01:50:33.986]  And it's not going to reform the police.
[01:50:34.486 --> 01:50:40.588]  Reaching out to the police, educating them, standing up to bad cops, but from a position of justice, not of hatred.
[01:50:41.288 --> 01:50:45.490]  And supporting good police as a role model is what's going to fix things.
[01:50:46.570 --> 01:50:48.791]  And then we can turn things around, because as I've said,
[01:50:49.764 --> 01:50:50.265]  I studied it.
[01:50:50.725 --> 01:50:53.648]  The police are one of the easiest wake-up groups out there.
[01:50:54.008 --> 01:50:55.550]  They already are concerned.
[01:50:55.570 --> 01:50:56.391]  They're freaked out.
[01:50:56.931 --> 01:50:58.974]  They understand there's a manipulation going on.
[01:50:59.474 --> 01:51:07.863]  And if you just reach out to most of them with the data, they will absolutely wake up instead of being manipulated.

[01:51:40.842 --> 01:51:42.923]  What's the best way to keep secret for somebody?
[01:51:43.443 --> 01:51:47.365]  Well, you give them something that they want so bad that they don't care what you're hiding.
[01:51:47.705 --> 01:51:52.647]  The year is 2007 and 20% of the state of California is employed in real estate.
[01:51:52.968 --> 01:51:58.110]  We live in a capitalistic nation of kings and prey upon the greed of the selfish pawns.
[01:51:58.610 --> 01:51:59.911]  Based on a true story.
[01:52:00.111 --> 01:52:04.373]  We created the American dream where everybody could qualify for one of these loans.
[01:52:05.213 --> 01:52:08.815]  Americons in select theaters January 23rd.
[01:52:09.335 --> 01:52:14.177]  Did you know by age 50 half of all men have an enlarged prostate?
[01:52:14.657 --> 01:52:20.940]  This means more urges to urinate, longer bathroom trips, waking at night to urinate, or issues with sex.
[01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:23.481]  If this sounds familiar, call us now.

[01:52:53.022 --> 01:52:56.885]  This Super Beta Prostate free offer is for listeners of this station.

[01:53:08.974 --> 01:53:11.556]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:53:11.817 --> 01:53:16.681]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:53:16.941 --> 01:53:24.828]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:53:25.069 --> 01:53:29.372]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:53:29.593 --> 01:53:33.396]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:53:33.556 --> 01:53:39.260]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:42.282]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:53:42.662 --> 01:53:47.886]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[01:53:48.026 --> 01:53:56.151]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[01:54:16.261 --> 01:54:19.604]  I'll be back this Sunday in studio live.
[01:54:19.624 --> 01:54:20.284]  4 to 6 p.m.
[01:54:20.304 --> 01:54:22.746]  David Knott did a great job last week.
[01:54:22.786 --> 01:54:25.288]  He sits in here and there because I like hearing him myself.
[01:54:25.308 --> 01:54:26.368]  I tune in when he's on.
[01:54:26.388 --> 01:54:27.429]  He just gets better and better.
[01:54:27.449 --> 01:54:28.110]  He's such a great mind.
[01:54:39.958 --> 01:54:42.119]  We've got one of his special reports coming up in the next hour.
[01:54:42.179 --> 01:54:43.039]  It's very powerful.
[01:54:43.479 --> 01:54:44.779]  From last night's nightly news.
[01:54:45.299 --> 01:54:49.060]  I'll go to Harry and Regina and everybody else as soon as we start the next hour.
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:51.061]  We're only going to play a minute of this.
[01:54:51.121 --> 01:54:58.203]  The full Fox 2 out of Detroit newscast is on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and the featured news area.
[01:54:59.511 --> 01:55:06.715]  And the families forgive this guy for torturing and killing with his accomplice, their two sons, for no reason, but they were white.
[01:55:07.396 --> 01:55:14.380]  And then he says, hey, black lives matter at the end, and I'm sorry for the blacks killed, like Brown and others.
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:15.760]  I mean, it's just, it's just crazy.
[01:55:17.061 --> 01:55:21.003]  And it shows the position of dumbing down the system wants us to get into.
[01:55:21.364 --> 01:55:26.887]  When we're all just human beings, and it is the new world order that is destroying our future and attacking us.
[01:55:28.049 --> 01:55:29.290]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[01:55:29.610 --> 01:55:32.293]  And I will carry that with me for the rest of my life here on Earth.
[01:55:32.633 --> 01:55:37.417]  The mothers of the teens expressing the deep, devastating pain and loss left behind.
[01:55:37.818 --> 01:55:42.342]  Yet when Young had his chance to apologize to the families, he did nothing of the sort.
[01:55:42.975 --> 01:55:47.518]  I'd like to say sorry to the families of Ayanna Jones, Michael Brown, Eric Gardner.
[01:55:48.058 --> 01:55:53.221]  And I want to apologize to them for not being able to get justice for their loved ones who was murdered in cold blood.
[01:55:53.442 --> 01:55:57.404]  And in respect for the peaceful protest, I want to say hands up, don't shoot, Black Lives Matter.
[01:55:58.004 --> 01:55:58.665]  That's it, Your Honor.
[01:55:58.825 --> 01:55:59.685]  All right.
[01:56:02.427 --> 01:56:10.751]  People in the courtroom react in disbelief, but still, the message from the families of Jacob Kudla and Jordan Bavish won a forgiveness.
[01:56:11.332 --> 01:56:15.314]  In the end, knowing who Jordan was, I believe he would want me to offer forgiveness.
[01:56:15.914 --> 01:56:20.156]  Although I know I may struggle with that endeavor for the rest of my life, it would be what Jordan would want.
[01:56:20.476 --> 01:56:24.338]  On behalf of Jordan and myself, I will pray for forgiveness for both of you.
[01:56:24.719 --> 01:56:31.042]  No matter what sentence the court imposes today, these defendants will have to answer to God.
[01:56:32.697 --> 01:56:33.398]  God's got this.
[01:56:33.578 --> 01:56:36.060]  Thank you for letting me speak.
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:36.500]  Thank you.
[01:56:37.021 --> 01:56:39.042]  Their two sons were trying to buy marijuana.
[01:56:39.803 --> 01:56:41.544]  Two little goofy marijuana guys.
[01:56:42.505 --> 01:56:43.866]  Looked like nice little guys.
[01:56:44.907 --> 01:56:47.489]  But I don't say this to put the moms down.
[01:56:47.509 --> 01:56:56.757]  I'm sorry for their loss, but for everybody listening, mothers and fathers need to tell their kids that, hey, if you're going to get into drugs, don't go to the worst ghetto to get them.
[01:56:58.766 --> 01:57:05.470]  Just the ignorance of white trendies is mind-boggling.
[01:57:06.551 --> 01:57:07.511]  But I guess I was dumb.
[01:57:07.531 --> 01:57:11.354]  I would go into South Dallas to buy liquor when I was, like, 15, 16.
[01:57:12.254 --> 01:57:18.078]  I'd ride along with friends, you know, to have a party when parents were out of town or whatever, you know, have the cheerleaders over.
[01:57:18.938 --> 01:57:24.061]  And we would go to the foreign-owned, usually Pakistani or whatever stores, and they'd sell us Jack Daniels and stuff.
[01:57:24.982 --> 01:57:27.944]  Or we'd get whatever was cheapest, Everclear and, like, Milwaukee's Best.
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:32.921]  Um, and uh, I guess I got in fights a few times.
[01:57:33.181 --> 01:57:37.002]  I wouldn't give, I wouldn't, I'd start fighting when people came over and tried to rob me.
[01:57:38.023 --> 01:57:40.743]  Um, and my parents didn't know about it.
[01:57:40.763 --> 01:57:42.384]  So I guess you can't really blame the parents.
[01:57:42.904 --> 01:57:44.044]  Kids are just so stupid.
[01:57:45.145 --> 01:57:46.965]  Uh, so I can't even criticize these guys.
[01:57:46.985 --> 01:57:48.026]  I was just as dumb as they were.
[01:57:48.046 --> 01:57:49.086]  I just wasn't buying marijuana.
[01:57:51.186 --> 01:57:53.008]  But the issue is, this is the same thing.
[01:57:53.048 --> 01:57:59.853]  It's okay for you to torture two yuppie trendies to death who didn't do anything to you and probably have white guilt because they're white.
[01:58:00.474 --> 01:58:03.857]  Or you shoot two cops in the head because they deserve it because they're cops.
[01:58:04.017 --> 01:58:05.278]  This is not the direction to go.
[01:58:05.778 --> 01:58:09.501]  Or the Klan goes out and kills some black people because, you know, black people killed some whites.
[01:58:09.821 --> 01:58:11.062]  This is civil war, folks.
[01:58:11.103 --> 01:58:12.504]  This is what George Soros wants.

[02:00:22.342 --> 02:00:23.223]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.883 --> 02:00:27.505]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.086 --> 02:00:32.128]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:35.367 --> 02:00:40.910]  Third hour, wide open phones, special reports, breaking news, it's all coming up.
[02:00:40.930 --> 02:00:46.832]  Let's talk to Harry, then Regina, then Jay, then Kelly, Ron and others.
[02:00:46.852 --> 02:00:47.052]  800-259-99231.
[02:00:47.092 --> 02:00:51.895]  Harry, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[02:00:53.215 --> 02:01:00.318]  Yes sir, I'd like to talk about the weaponization of country music the same way that rap and hip-hop was weaponized.
[02:01:00.338 --> 02:01:03.520]  Oh yeah, they're turning it into gangster thug white trashism, absolutely.
[02:01:04.855 --> 02:01:06.316]  It's disgusting.
[02:01:06.576 --> 02:01:19.962]  I grew up listening to country, you know, Hank and Merle and Waylon and they call it new young country and it's specifically targeted at young kids like prepubescent and teenagers.
[02:01:20.202 --> 02:01:23.683]  And it's basically a CIA version of black gangster rap for country.
[02:01:24.904 --> 02:01:31.387]  And it's going in the exact same direction and in a few years you're going to be seeing the same kind of stuff that's going on in that kind of culture.
[02:01:32.048 --> 02:01:38.832]  With young white kids that were into country music, it's really weird how they can do that.
[02:01:39.692 --> 02:01:41.393]  Well, they can't have anybody be moral.
[02:01:41.433 --> 02:01:42.714]  They gotta degenerate you down.
[02:01:42.734 --> 02:01:44.435]  You know, your parents don't spend time with you.
[02:01:44.835 --> 02:01:56.902]  I guarantee you, every time I've studied these thugs that kill people and aren't sorry, they always were just kept in a crib in crap-filled diapers, you know, by welfare moms, and they just hate everybody and just don't feel loved and are just pathetic.
[02:01:59.181 --> 02:02:00.262]  Yeah.
[02:02:00.342 --> 02:02:16.371]  One more thing I wanted to say is that I went and seen American Sniper and at the very end of when he leaves the house after pointing the gun at his wife, you know, like Chris Kyle supposedly pointed a gun at his wife.
[02:02:16.411 --> 02:02:17.251]  That was really stupid.
[02:02:17.291 --> 02:02:23.415]  But at the end of the movie, it says right after this, Chris Kyle was killed by a veteran.
[02:02:24.479 --> 02:02:31.545]  They didn't elaborate on that at all, they just said... That's right, and it's the perfect PSYOP to then the new enemy is the veteran, so it's the cherry on top.
[02:02:32.146 --> 02:02:34.388]  All fitting into the Justice Department propaganda.
[02:02:34.408 --> 02:02:37.710]  And we've looked into it, clearly that was all made up.
[02:02:37.851 --> 02:02:41.193]  They killed Kyle because it would make him even a bigger hero to be dead.
[02:02:41.894 --> 02:02:45.377]  And that should be a warning to everybody that goes along with these PSYOPs.
[02:02:47.691 --> 02:02:48.972]  Yeah, but I was pretty disgusted.
[02:02:49.312 --> 02:02:49.933]  I'm a veteran.
[02:02:49.993 --> 02:02:56.478]  I served in Iraq for 13 months, and I was pretty disgusted about that movie, so... Well, I know this.
[02:02:58.819 --> 02:02:59.380]  I know this.
[02:03:00.981 --> 02:03:05.384]  The Army will not engage, and I'm not saying the Army's perfect, in that type of PR baloney.
[02:03:06.525 --> 02:03:15.452]  I mean, it is just over the top, but the Navy's in competition with the Army, and they want their own Army.
[02:03:16.266 --> 02:03:19.467]  And so they've gone from two SEAL teams to, oh, like, probably 20 now.
[02:03:19.527 --> 02:03:20.287]  They say there's 10.
[02:03:21.407 --> 02:03:24.248]  And they just act like, you know, it's Superman or something.
[02:03:24.408 --> 02:03:34.330]  And the truth is, it is really dangerous jobs, and I think the average SEAL's, you know, really a great patriotic person, but this is all just meant to get kids to join the military.
[02:03:34.770 --> 02:03:36.350]  It's all a giant PR stunt.
[02:03:38.311 --> 02:03:39.671]  I'll say, watching the movie,
[02:03:41.476 --> 02:03:42.777]  You know, I grew up in East Texas.
[02:03:42.977 --> 02:03:44.157]  Northeast Texas and East Texas.
[02:03:44.177 --> 02:03:45.898]  We've got a ranch in Central East Texas.
[02:03:46.798 --> 02:03:53.401]  And I know so many people just like Chris Kyle that will help you change your tire or come help you roof your house.
[02:03:54.102 --> 02:03:57.443]  You can, you know, give them, you know, money to keep for 10 years.
[02:03:57.483 --> 02:03:58.444]  You come back, it'll be there.
[02:04:00.084 --> 02:04:02.966]  They're very honorable people on average, folks like that.
[02:04:03.686 --> 02:04:10.169]  But they're also very gullible and will really buy into propaganda and are killing machines.
[02:04:11.361 --> 02:04:14.483]  And some people have a family in the military.
[02:04:18.044 --> 02:04:40.015]  It's just smart people, but they just are tribal, and they will follow orders, and they'll do whatever they're told, and that's why you have such heavy recruiting for special operations and the CIA out of Texas and places like that, because they take sheepdogs and turn them into wolves, and they don't even ever know they're wolves.
[02:04:40.035 --> 02:04:40.575]  Isn't that sad?
[02:04:41.897 --> 02:04:42.938]  Yeah, it is sad.
[02:04:42.978 --> 02:04:43.958]  It's disgusting.
[02:04:46.480 --> 02:04:47.181]  All right, brother.
[02:04:47.221 --> 02:04:47.861]  Appreciate you.
[02:04:47.901 --> 02:04:48.382]  We'll be back.
[02:04:49.202 --> 02:04:52.304]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com are the websites.
[02:04:53.025 --> 02:04:58.309]  Regina and Jay and everybody, we're going to come right back to you.
[02:04:58.329 --> 02:04:58.429]  800-259-9231.
[02:04:58.569 --> 02:05:05.774]  I know the State of the Union already happened, but David Knight did an analysis of it for the Nightly News last night that was so powerful.
[02:05:05.794 --> 02:05:08.676]  We're going to play that at the bottom of the next hour or this hour.
[02:05:10.060 --> 02:05:18.745]  Sold out for weeks through the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[02:05:19.046 --> 02:05:29.052]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[02:05:29.592 --> 02:05:35.636]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:05:35.996 --> 02:05:42.140]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:50.586]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[02:05:51.006 --> 02:05:53.808]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:05:54.088 --> 02:05:55.249]  No needles, no injections.
[02:05:55.629 --> 02:05:56.870]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:05:57.010 --> 02:05:57.931]  Try it for yourself.
[02:05:58.231 --> 02:05:59.192]  Discover the secret.
[02:05:59.532 --> 02:05:59.872]  Secret 12.
[02:06:00.633 --> 02:06:02.694]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[02:07:09.918 --> 02:07:10.839]  Alex Jones here.

[02:08:25.503 --> 02:08:31.445]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:31.706 --> 02:08:34.527]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:35.187 --> 02:08:39.629]  We're talking about the state of the world.
[02:08:39.649 --> 02:08:42.590]  They've got the state of the world economic forum going right now.
[02:08:42.610 --> 02:08:44.671]  Lots of globalist propaganda coming out of there.
[02:08:45.091 --> 02:08:46.892]  That's coming up after we take a bunch of phone calls.
[02:08:47.981 --> 02:08:57.183]  We're also going to look at backwards Clintons praise Saudi's king humanitarian efforts what sending Al-Qaeda into Syria.
[02:08:58.503 --> 02:08:59.483]  We're going to be looking at that.
[02:08:59.563 --> 02:09:08.024]  I mean you watch the news and they act like Syria you know never had Saudi Arabia involved or Saudi Arabia is battling ISIS.
[02:09:08.645 --> 02:09:15.886]  It's in mainline news from two years ago and then even last year when they renamed it ISIS or ISIL that Saudi Arabia is funding them.
[02:09:15.946 --> 02:09:16.386]  I mean it's just
[02:09:17.458 --> 02:09:21.100]  You watch this and you'd think that the king of Saudi Arabia was Santa Claus.
[02:09:22.061 --> 02:09:28.345]  But let's go to your phone calls right now, ahead of that other news I'm going to be getting to.
[02:09:28.925 --> 02:09:30.526]  Let's go to Regina in Florida.
[02:09:30.546 --> 02:09:31.527]  Thanks for calling, Regina.
[02:09:31.547 --> 02:09:35.009]  Hi Alex, are you there?
[02:09:35.429 --> 02:09:35.949]  I sure am.
[02:09:35.969 --> 02:09:39.431]  How are you doing today?
[02:09:39.872 --> 02:09:41.453]  I'm just so messed up.
[02:09:43.089 --> 02:09:44.190]  I don't even know where to begin.
[02:09:44.230 --> 02:09:48.213]  I would like to teach your listeners something about a federal code, if I could.
[02:09:48.513 --> 02:09:48.673]  Sure.
[02:09:48.713 --> 02:09:51.895]  We've got totally open phones today on any subject you want to raise.
[02:09:51.915 --> 02:09:52.515]  Just get to it.
[02:09:53.956 --> 02:09:54.157]  All right.
[02:09:54.417 --> 02:09:58.880]  There's a federal code that we were teaching people back when I was like 19.
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:00.081]  I'm 43 now.
[02:10:00.961 --> 02:10:03.443]  I've been awake for years and years and years.
[02:10:04.264 --> 02:10:04.924]  It's UCC 1-207.7.
[02:10:11.485 --> 02:10:20.196]  Now, what this code says is that you can take your ID, you can take your insurance, you can take your registrations and your tags, and you can shove them where the sun doesn't shine.
[02:10:21.061 --> 02:10:27.326]  What we would do is Atlanta APD would set up roadblocks, which are unconstitutional and illegal.
[02:10:27.786 --> 02:10:30.388]  So there was this little group of us that knew what was going on.
[02:10:30.868 --> 02:10:41.536]  So we would find out where the roadblock was and purposely have our friend, who had an international driver's license, drive through with her little white beat up old car.
[02:10:41.556 --> 02:10:42.757]  I don't even remember what it was.
[02:10:43.298 --> 02:10:48.322]  No tags, no insurance, no driver's license, and nobody in the car had ID.
[02:10:49.485 --> 02:10:55.350]  We would drive through the roadblock with a big poster that said, GCC 1-207.7.
[02:10:55.410 --> 02:11:01.295]  Yeah, well that's like the illegal aliens are above the law and don't have to have IDs or proper license plates or anything.
[02:11:01.795 --> 02:11:05.919]  And there are a lot of codes out there that deal with the fact of the right to travel.
[02:11:06.419 --> 02:11:07.420]  I appreciate your call.
[02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:08.781]  Let me address this now.
[02:11:09.482 --> 02:11:19.638]  Because there's a lot of brainwashing out there, both patriot mythology on one end that's wrong, I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm saying some people are about their interpretations, and then the mythology the police are taught.
[02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:23.304]  It is not a privilege to drive or travel.
[02:11:25.876 --> 02:11:33.562]  It is a privilege in states to engage in commerce on public right-of-ways that are paid for by taxpayers.
[02:11:34.023 --> 02:11:42.350]  And so they began the driver's license in New Jersey and New York in the late 1920s, early 30s, depending on the area.
[02:11:43.751 --> 02:11:45.432]  They used class warfare.
[02:11:45.472 --> 02:11:48.034]  They said, these trucks are tearing up the new roads.
[02:11:49.073 --> 02:11:53.317]  And they're making money, so we're going to make them pay a fee for the roads.
[02:11:54.077 --> 02:11:55.979]  So that's where the privilege garbage started.
[02:11:56.039 --> 02:12:03.105]  I've got Supreme Court rulings into the 60s saying it's not a privilege to drive.
[02:12:03.165 --> 02:12:14.895]  That's why you still in most states can't stop a tractor or other farm implement as long as they have the safety orange diamond on them.
[02:12:15.696 --> 02:12:16.737]  They don't have to have registration.
[02:12:18.766 --> 02:12:20.808]  And I say this so the cops go, oh, that's right.
[02:12:21.728 --> 02:12:22.649]  He must be telling the truth.
[02:12:22.689 --> 02:12:23.449]  Just go look it up.
[02:12:23.509 --> 02:12:30.354]  I mean, I'm not going to, I don't have time to pull it all up right now and show people, but they're now saying it's a privilege to own guns.
[02:12:30.495 --> 02:12:31.015]  No, it's not.
[02:12:31.956 --> 02:12:32.416]  No, it's not.
[02:12:32.436 --> 02:12:33.797]  And the police know that's not true.
[02:12:34.998 --> 02:12:38.761]  Because there hasn't been 70, 80 years of brainwashing yet, but they're trying.
[02:12:39.431 --> 02:12:41.632]  That the right to self-defense is a privilege.
[02:12:42.112 --> 02:12:43.052]  No, it's an inherent right.
[02:12:43.592 --> 02:12:45.453]  The police have no responsibility to protect you.
[02:12:45.713 --> 02:12:51.554]  They're there to come grab you, to take you to the court, to take you to the jury, the grand jury, once someone's committed a crime.
[02:12:51.594 --> 02:12:55.876]  Now, if they can stop a crime and they see it happening, they should take action.
[02:12:56.176 --> 02:12:58.116]  The same common law goes to citizens.
[02:13:00.137 --> 02:13:03.938]  Just 50 years ago, if you saw your neighbor's house being robbed and you didn't do something, you'd get in trouble.
[02:13:06.338 --> 02:13:08.039]  So you have a responsibility to render aid.
[02:13:09.906 --> 02:13:14.230]  But there's no liability if you don't because you didn't know, basically.
[02:13:15.231 --> 02:13:16.772]  And the police sit on that all day.
[02:13:16.812 --> 02:13:17.473]  Well, that's fine.
[02:13:18.594 --> 02:13:20.756]  I have a right to defend myself and I have a right to travel.
[02:13:23.018 --> 02:13:30.584]  The problem is the police are so ignorant, just like the public, that they really believe you've got to have a license and registration and insurance.
[02:13:30.624 --> 02:13:36.589]  And notice they can just keep raising the insurance now until it's cost prohibitive for most people to have a car, and that's going to be the next phase.
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:40.464]  And then taxes by the mile, and all of that's being announced.
[02:13:40.504 --> 02:13:42.426]  I told you 20 years ago, now it's being announced.
[02:13:43.668 --> 02:13:45.971]  I read it in establishment publications back then.
[02:13:47.232 --> 02:13:51.097]  So I've just tried to warn people, I'm not a hero, I just know what I'm talking about.
[02:13:51.979 --> 02:13:52.279]  Okay?
[02:13:52.319 --> 02:13:52.860]  It's not hard.
[02:13:55.495 --> 02:14:17.873]  If you want to read Ecoscience or Tragedy and Hope, or the Anglo-American Establishment, or the Technotronic Era, or if you want to read Order of the Deathshead, or if you want to read Mein Kampf, if you want to read Lord Acton's letters, if you want to read Lord Milner's letters from the other perspective, if you want to read Cecil Rhodes' writings, if you want to read the five or six non-fiction books of H.G.
[02:14:17.893 --> 02:14:19.335]  Wells, or of
[02:14:20.874 --> 02:14:22.535]  All these other people, I mean, I've read it all.
[02:14:22.875 --> 02:14:25.116]  I mean, hundreds and hundreds of books.
[02:14:26.077 --> 02:14:27.477]  That's why I know the battle plan.
[02:14:28.698 --> 02:14:35.521]  And I know it's not as fun as Ballgate or Inflatagate or Deflatagate or whatever the stupid thing's called.
[02:14:39.543 --> 02:14:40.584]  But it's pretty darn important.
[02:14:43.145 --> 02:14:45.446]  Let's go to Jay in North Carolina.
[02:14:45.486 --> 02:14:46.147]  Jay, you're on the air.
[02:14:48.018 --> 02:14:49.379]  Hi Alex, thanks so much.
[02:14:49.839 --> 02:14:52.000]  I want to say first off, you guys are all rock stars.
[02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:54.341]  Thanks so much for everything you guys do.
[02:14:54.641 --> 02:14:55.641]  Oh, you're a sweetheart, ma'am.
[02:14:55.661 --> 02:14:56.302]  I want to thank you.
[02:14:58.263 --> 02:14:59.363]  I had a couple of things.
[02:14:59.663 --> 02:15:07.367]  I went on Yahoo this morning and one of the first things I noticed is that they had a headline that said people who skip vaccinations are incredibly selfish.
[02:15:09.086 --> 02:15:17.068]  And it kind of blew my mind because they tried to say that the research that's linking vaccines to autism has been discredited.
[02:15:17.449 --> 02:15:21.710]  And even one of the doctors went as far to say that just people are incredibly selfish for doing it.
[02:15:22.070 --> 02:15:23.010]  And that really bothers me.
[02:15:23.030 --> 02:15:23.390]  Well, that's right.
[02:15:23.410 --> 02:15:24.711]  They always sell the lie.
[02:15:24.751 --> 02:15:25.731]  It's always the same article.
[02:15:27.351 --> 02:15:35.455]  You know, regurgitated with a new date on it, you see it everywhere, that we're giving everyone the flu, we're giving everyone the measles, we're giving everyone whooping cough.
[02:15:35.815 --> 02:15:42.578]  Well, if you've had the measles, mumps, rubella, shots, and all this, and they're effective, then why are you getting it from us?
[02:15:42.638 --> 02:15:45.580]  The truth is, the flu shots never worked.
[02:15:46.180 --> 02:15:46.600]  Ever.
[02:15:47.060 --> 02:15:54.864]  And there have been more than 14, since the 1950s when it started, major mass die-offs that they've admitted the flu shots caused.
[02:15:55.484 --> 02:16:00.247]  I mean, they have the swine flu thing where 10,000 plus people died in the 70s from the damn vaccines.
[02:16:00.267 --> 02:16:00.907]  Excuse me, Lord.
[02:16:01.388 --> 02:16:02.488]  From the vaccines.
[02:16:03.028 --> 02:16:03.829]  I'm not doing that on purpose.
[02:16:03.869 --> 02:16:06.010]  I just get so angry, I start really telling you what to think.
[02:16:06.531 --> 02:16:08.732]  And it makes me violently angry.
[02:16:08.752 --> 02:16:14.155]  When I say violently angry, I want to throw stuff of how they prey on the public such as here.
[02:16:14.695 --> 02:16:17.257]  I mean, before he quit his show, Dr. Dina Dell.
[02:16:18.464 --> 02:16:23.405]  Syndicated, would be on the air, and every time I tune in it would be like, these people need to be arrested that don't take shots.
[02:16:23.986 --> 02:16:27.026]  These people need to, because they're giving us the disease.
[02:16:27.386 --> 02:16:29.607]  Bull, corny, hot dog.
[02:16:30.767 --> 02:16:31.988]  It's not true.
[02:16:32.488 --> 02:16:37.449]  There it is, measles case linked to Disneyland Rise and debate over vaccination intensifies.
[02:16:38.049 --> 02:16:41.570]  Oh, that's right, because someone must not have been vaccinated against the measles.
[02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:43.371]  Most measles vaccines don't work.
[02:16:43.951 --> 02:16:47.412]  Every, my dad retired last year because of Obamacare as a physician.
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:56.966]  He would see patients constantly on the edge of death that were coming in because they'd taken, they'd go, I got shingles, I took the vaccine two weeks ago, I don't know why I got them.
[02:16:57.366 --> 02:16:59.107]  It gives you the shingles!
[02:17:00.388 --> 02:17:05.651]  And so, it's so frustrating, it's so frustrating, it's so frustrating.
[02:17:05.692 --> 02:17:07.893]  We have more flu this year than we had ten years ago.
[02:17:08.133 --> 02:17:09.054]  That was in the news last week.
[02:17:09.294 --> 02:17:12.116]  And vaccination's at an all-time high because of the bullying.
[02:17:12.456 --> 02:17:14.537]  And they're getting ready for forced inoculation.
[02:17:14.617 --> 02:17:15.278]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[02:17:16.365 --> 02:17:19.348]  And it's true, and I personally myself have experienced it.
[02:17:19.408 --> 02:17:27.815]  My son has asthma, and it's sporadic when he has issues, and it's usually due to the weather changing.
[02:17:28.376 --> 02:17:33.220]  And anytime I take him to the doctor, they're trying to force me to get my sister.
[02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:36.203]  I work for social services here in my state.
[02:17:36.952 --> 02:17:42.353]  And even here, my sister brought my nephew to the clinic here just for his annual physical.
[02:17:42.974 --> 02:17:50.456]  And the nurse, one of my co-workers, I sat there and witnessed her almost try and bully my sister into giving my nephew a vaccine.
[02:17:50.696 --> 02:17:52.716]  But my sister held, you know, she held strong.
[02:17:52.776 --> 02:17:55.757]  She didn't back down and he didn't get the vaccine.
[02:17:55.797 --> 02:17:57.137]  And I was very proud of her for that.
[02:17:57.457 --> 02:17:58.298]  But you can see it.
[02:17:58.338 --> 02:18:00.198]  They will truly try and bully you.
[02:18:00.538 --> 02:18:03.539]  And for me, they've even called CPS on me.
[02:18:04.159 --> 02:18:10.685]  When I've had long documentation verifying that I try to take my, not that I try, I do take my son to the doctor.
[02:18:10.705 --> 02:18:12.607]  I have prescriptions and everything else.
[02:18:12.647 --> 02:18:13.908]  Sure, sure, let's talk about this.
[02:18:13.988 --> 02:18:20.954]  You're already a social worker and the own system is coming after you as if it's neglect when there's no law you've got to take the shot.
[02:18:21.235 --> 02:18:22.216]  They're implying medical...
[02:18:22.876 --> 02:18:27.857]  A neglect that's open-ended, when there's no law to take the shot, there's massive evidence it's dangerous.
[02:18:28.237 --> 02:18:36.259]  Again, if they had clean, effective vaccines, I would take them, because immunity science is real, but it has a negative end, even if it's done properly.
[02:18:36.679 --> 02:18:40.820]  It's associated with cancer, autoimmune disorders, you get stung by a bee, you might die.
[02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:43.661]  There's a lot more deadly stuff in a shot than, you know, a bee sting.
[02:18:44.141 --> 02:18:49.782]  It can kill you, and it does, but if they were honest about it, then I might be more inclined to take it, but no!
[02:18:50.933 --> 02:18:52.014]  They're super secretive.
[02:18:52.574 --> 02:18:54.956]  They've been caught adding all sorts of stuff to vaccines.
[02:18:55.316 --> 02:18:58.138]  You know, they gave black folks syphilis, telling them it was vaccines.
[02:18:58.519 --> 02:19:00.700]  So, I mean, let's talk about what this government's been caught.
[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:06.144]  They just got caught in India last year, sterilizing hundreds of thousands of women with a tetanus shot.
[02:19:06.485 --> 02:19:06.985]  Again!
[02:19:07.405 --> 02:19:08.806]  They've been caught since the 70s doing it!
[02:19:10.106 --> 02:19:12.048]  And I go to the doctor and they go, don't you want to give your kid a tetanus shot?
[02:19:12.068 --> 02:19:17.513]  And I go, tetanus has been found that they can add things to it to then do a lot of social engineering with it.
[02:19:17.993 --> 02:19:18.213]  No.
[02:19:18.333 --> 02:19:20.335]  And the doctor will go, well, actually I heard about that too.
[02:19:20.715 --> 02:19:23.858]  I don't vaccinate, but don't you tell anybody, Alex, or you got a TV show.
[02:19:24.178 --> 02:19:28.903]  By the way, they're still giving kids in East Austin the live polio vaccine that's got SV40 in it, Alex.
[02:19:29.263 --> 02:19:32.626]  I didn't believe you 10 years ago until I saw it when I volunteered for a clinic.
[02:19:32.846 --> 02:19:33.947]  But don't you tell anybody.
[02:19:34.027 --> 02:19:36.489]  I mean, I was told this by one of the biggest
[02:19:38.251 --> 02:19:39.412]  Pediatricians in Austin.
[02:19:39.432 --> 02:19:40.673]  He retired a couple years ago.
[02:19:41.033 --> 02:19:45.016]  And he grabbed my arm after he said it and said, don't you tell anybody I told you that though.
[02:19:45.957 --> 02:19:47.538]  So listen, don't feel bad.
[02:19:47.578 --> 02:19:48.399]  They're being bullied.
[02:19:48.459 --> 02:19:49.820]  Healthcare workers are being bullied.
[02:19:50.481 --> 02:19:51.582]  And God bless you.
[02:19:51.622 --> 02:19:52.603]  I appreciate your call, Jay.
[02:19:52.623 --> 02:19:56.265]  That makes me so angry.
[02:19:56.346 --> 02:19:56.666]  Kelly.
[02:19:58.115 --> 02:19:58.715]  And others.
[02:19:58.875 --> 02:20:03.138]  Ron, Steve, Nick, your calls are all coming up.
[02:20:03.918 --> 02:20:04.519]  Stay with us.
[02:20:04.639 --> 02:20:07.520]  Nick wants to talk about Chris Kyle and Kraft International.
[02:20:07.960 --> 02:20:08.421]  Stay with us.
[02:20:10.200 --> 02:20:12.781]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.

[02:20:41.157 --> 02:20:42.998]  I had to stop and get my vitamins for the month.

[02:24:27.717 --> 02:24:42.204]  The way you know it's a criminal conspiracy is we have so many of the documents, declassifications and admissions, but also there's a system-wide lie that vaccines are the law and that vaccines are safe and effective, even though it's just everywhere the evidence they're deadly.
[02:24:42.764 --> 02:24:45.865]  And one of the major causes of cancer and neurological disorder is exploding.
[02:24:46.926 --> 02:24:50.587]  And they'll lie and say it's the law, your kid has to have it to go to school when there is no law.
[02:24:53.048 --> 02:24:56.210]  And when parents go and find out, I'm telling the truth, they have paradigm shifts.
[02:24:57.363 --> 02:24:58.124]  Paradigm shifts.
[02:24:59.545 --> 02:25:08.572]  Because they'll kick your child out of school under policy, saying it's a policy they gotta have a shot, when the law says they can't do that.
[02:25:09.373 --> 02:25:14.377]  And then they'll say you're truant because you're kicked out of school and call the cops in when they kicked you out.
[02:25:15.778 --> 02:25:23.124]  And they've got corrupt family court judges that are so evil in some areas that they will put your child in juvenile detention
[02:25:25.768 --> 02:25:27.008]  For not taking the vaccines.
[02:25:27.968 --> 02:25:29.109]  But it's because of truancy.
[02:25:29.409 --> 02:25:31.089]  It's all games that are played.
[02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:34.230]  And they run these hoaxes.
[02:25:34.530 --> 02:25:39.131]  They ran one like 10 years ago in Maryland, where they for weeks said, yeah, the kids will be forced to be inoculated.
[02:25:39.171 --> 02:25:40.571]  Thousands line up in Maryland.
[02:25:40.951 --> 02:25:42.192]  And I had the state attorney on.
[02:25:42.232 --> 02:25:44.792]  He laughed on air and he said, yeah, I don't give my kids vaccines.
[02:25:44.832 --> 02:25:45.652]  He said, you're a smart guy.
[02:25:45.672 --> 02:25:46.553]  You ought to be a lawyer, Alex.
[02:25:46.813 --> 02:25:47.713]  Like it was cool.
[02:25:48.413 --> 02:25:54.198]  That I said, let me guess, you've got the waivers up there with the judge in case somebody asks, but you don't tell anybody there's a waiver.
[02:25:54.659 --> 02:25:55.980]  And he goes, man, you're smart.
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:56.561]  He was a black guy.
[02:25:56.581 --> 02:25:58.643]  He goes, man, it was mainly black people they were forcing to take it.
[02:25:58.663 --> 02:26:00.284]  He goes, you ought to be a lawyer.
[02:26:00.324 --> 02:26:01.045]  You're real smart.
[02:26:01.065 --> 02:26:02.927]  And I said, no, what you're doing is criminal in my view.
[02:26:02.947 --> 02:26:04.768]  And he said, you know what, I got to go.
[02:26:05.229 --> 02:26:06.170]  We ought to find that interview.
[02:26:06.991 --> 02:26:13.753]  And it made me very sick that you'll have a doctor or a nurse at the hospital go, yeah, after we pressure you to take the shots and you didn't.
[02:26:14.013 --> 02:26:15.333]  Truth is, we none of us take them either.
[02:26:15.913 --> 02:26:16.673]  They're trying to make us do.
[02:26:17.633 --> 02:26:26.395]  And it's just like... I mean, I don't know any cops I know out there where they tried to make them take smallpox shots in 2002 that were killing so many people.
[02:26:26.776 --> 02:26:28.416]  All the cops, I mean, just across the country.
[02:26:29.516 --> 02:26:32.417]  They ordered millions of first responders to take it, and they said less than 1% took it.
[02:26:33.817 --> 02:26:35.999]  The police unions went, no way!
[02:26:36.199 --> 02:26:37.280]  No, no, no!
[02:26:37.580 --> 02:26:38.280]  Good, see?
[02:26:40.982 --> 02:26:46.907]  Why is it the police that I noticed were the least group daring that whole thing to take it?
[02:26:48.708 --> 02:26:52.431]  USA Today had a whole breakdown of how no one would take it in the government.
[02:26:52.451 --> 02:26:57.074]  Because word spread quick when they first started giving the shots out and started killing people.
[02:26:57.975 --> 02:27:00.997]  Causing an autoimmune response in the heart this time, or the lungs.
[02:27:02.332 --> 02:27:05.753]  You have a 35-year-old cop take that shot and have a heart attack, drop dead on the spot.
[02:27:05.773 --> 02:27:16.297]  What do you think happens when you give a baby 6, 7, 8 vaccines at once, their brain swells up, they get blood on the brain, they give them a CAT scan, and they tell the officers, mama shook this baby.
[02:27:18.338 --> 02:27:19.859]  And there's blood on the brain and you get indicted.
[02:27:21.239 --> 02:27:23.100]  Not enough, your kid's brain damaged or dies.
[02:27:23.780 --> 02:27:25.021]  Now they're going to indict you.
[02:27:25.301 --> 02:27:27.862]  So see, they lie about the shots, saying it's the law.
[02:27:28.122 --> 02:27:30.463]  They lie about saying it's a privilege to drive.
[02:27:30.523 --> 02:27:31.003]  No, it's not.
[02:27:32.278 --> 02:27:53.268]  I'll tell you how many times I've been in a checkpoint and the cop goes, it's a privilege to drive, just, you got a lot of work to do, Jones, just, back when Clinton, it happened a lot in Austin back when Clinton was in, they had federal funds to have checkpoints all over the country, and I would deliberately hear about them and drive to them, and they'd say, and the cops would pull over and start videotaping, and they'd go, uh, Alex, are the Russians gonna sneak out and get me in the black helicopters?
[02:27:53.568 --> 02:27:54.669]  Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!
[02:27:55.089 --> 02:27:55.349]  You know?
[02:27:56.636 --> 02:27:59.178]  Just stay back 50 yards, we won't arrest you!
[02:27:59.518 --> 02:28:01.059]  Are the helicopters gonna get me?
[02:28:01.079 --> 02:28:02.260]  We have footage of this, we've aired.
[02:28:04.281 --> 02:28:07.243]  On the local access show, I took clips of it and put it in Police Day 2000.
[02:28:07.643 --> 02:28:10.365]  Are the Martians gonna get me?
[02:28:10.445 --> 02:28:11.666]  The cops don't do that now.
[02:28:12.266 --> 02:28:12.666]  They know.
[02:28:13.347 --> 02:28:13.987]  It was all real.
[02:28:14.667 --> 02:28:15.148]  That's good!
[02:28:15.788 --> 02:28:19.891]  We don't need to be enemies with the police because they're a microcosm of everything else.
[02:28:19.931 --> 02:28:24.654]  We need to inform people and just show them the fraud and everything else will fall into place.
[02:28:25.529 --> 02:28:30.350]  But that's a hard road to hoe because it's so easy, but you've got to do it over and over again.
[02:28:31.890 --> 02:28:33.491]  It's like picking cotton or something.
[02:28:33.911 --> 02:28:35.611]  It's easy to do, but it's repetitive.
[02:28:36.291 --> 02:28:37.752]  You've got to just keep putting the truth out.
[02:28:37.772 --> 02:28:38.912]  All right, let's go to calls.
[02:28:38.992 --> 02:28:41.572]  Kelly in Texas, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:28:42.813 --> 02:28:44.333]  Yes, hey Alex, how you doing today?
[02:28:44.373 --> 02:28:44.973]  You're on fire.
[02:28:45.373 --> 02:28:45.913]  Am I, brother?
[02:28:45.953 --> 02:28:46.994]  Well, thanks for putting up with it.
[02:28:47.814 --> 02:28:48.414]  That's okay.
[02:28:49.374 --> 02:28:53.335]  Yeah, man, you know, it's really hard to wake people up nowadays.
[02:28:54.141 --> 02:29:11.592]  There's a lot of stories that are coming out, you know, and you try to wake up your family and your friends and anybody that's around you and close to you, you know, you tell them, Hey, look, you know, I just saw a story the other day that the police can now look through your walls with a radar and they can tell what you're doing inside your home.
[02:29:12.327 --> 02:29:15.191]  And everybody's like, oh no, there's no way they're doing that.
[02:29:15.251 --> 02:29:16.633]  There's no way it's happening.
[02:29:16.713 --> 02:29:22.801]  Yeah, even when it was in USA Today, Front Page will pull that up, and they admit it.
[02:29:23.181 --> 02:29:26.065]  People say it isn't real because they were preconditioned it didn't exist.
[02:29:26.265 --> 02:29:29.189]  And that's 20-year-old technology that they're showing you now.
[02:29:29.249 --> 02:29:30.130]  It's been going on for 20 years.
[02:29:31.377 --> 02:29:31.857]  Exactly.
[02:29:31.877 --> 02:29:32.578]  That's what I told them.
[02:29:32.618 --> 02:29:36.600]  This was rolled out 15 years ago, you know, and they still don't believe you.
[02:29:36.620 --> 02:29:44.305]  So you bring them the story and they're like, well, I'm not worried about it because they're not going to be doing that to me, you know, so I'm not worried about that.
[02:29:44.705 --> 02:29:45.045]  Stay there.
[02:29:45.085 --> 02:29:45.986]  I don't want to cut you short.
[02:29:46.026 --> 02:29:46.726]  Finish your point.
[02:29:47.087 --> 02:29:49.048]  Then we'll go to Ron and others.
[02:29:49.068 --> 02:29:54.091]  And then I'm going to get to this special report David Knight put out that's amazingly hardcore and accurate.
[02:29:54.111 --> 02:29:55.452]  And we've got some other breaking news.
[02:29:55.472 --> 02:29:55.812]  Stay with us.
[02:29:59.349 --> 02:30:02.356]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.298 --> 02:30:05.964]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.989 --> 02:30:11.630]  The knowledge of the ancients.
[02:30:11.950 --> 02:30:15.533]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[02:30:15.773 --> 02:30:18.375]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.

[02:32:10.051 --> 02:32:13.554]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:32:13.714 --> 02:32:17.677]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:32:17.998 --> 02:32:19.459]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:32:19.779 --> 02:32:24.803]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.

[02:33:16.234 --> 02:33:20.137]  One of them is State of the Union decoded by David Knight.
[02:33:36.980 --> 02:33:39.322]  I know the State of the Union happened a few days ago, but it's very important.
[02:33:39.342 --> 02:33:40.743]  This was on the Nightly News last night.
[02:33:40.763 --> 02:33:44.106]  I also want to get to this three-minute report.
[02:33:44.126 --> 02:33:45.727]  Well, there's two of them by Leanne McAdoo.
[02:33:47.108 --> 02:33:50.190]  I don't know which one was the one I saw last night.
[02:33:51.431 --> 02:33:52.032]  I'm sorry, Nico.
[02:33:54.175 --> 02:33:54.635]  Okay, good.
[02:33:54.675 --> 02:33:57.338]  So we're going to... So we just listened to her twice.
[02:33:57.398 --> 02:33:57.618]  Good.
[02:33:58.059 --> 02:33:58.759]  I was confused.
[02:33:58.959 --> 02:34:00.841]  But the one I saw last night was powerful.
[02:34:00.861 --> 02:34:01.902]  We're going to play that.
[02:34:01.982 --> 02:34:04.745]  Journalist sentenced to five years for thought crime.
[02:34:04.765 --> 02:34:05.425]  I want to get to that.
[02:34:05.866 --> 02:34:08.728]  And I want to go to Kelly, Ron, Steve, Ed, and Nick.
[02:34:08.748 --> 02:34:11.371]  That'll be it for calls today because I need to get to these reports.
[02:34:12.292 --> 02:34:15.595]  First off, when you shop with the good guys,

[02:34:38.297 --> 02:34:42.059]  And we did that, of course, with the InfoWarsLife.com line of products.
[02:34:42.539 --> 02:34:45.141]  Some of them are very inexpensive, some of them are very expensive.
[02:34:46.817 --> 02:34:51.442]  We've got a full spectrum from high quality colloidal silver to the best nascent iodine out there.
[02:34:51.762 --> 02:34:52.463]  Proprietary.
[02:34:52.503 --> 02:34:54.185]  Nobody else has got this iodine.
[02:34:54.846 --> 02:34:58.149]  It doesn't taste bad in your mouth because it's not bound garbage iodine.
[02:34:58.410 --> 02:35:00.312]  It's deep earth purple crystal source.
[02:35:00.912 --> 02:35:06.578]  The point is, we got a lot of really great products there and when you shop and get the products there,
[02:35:07.406 --> 02:35:07.566]  A lot
[02:35:25.345 --> 02:35:26.046]  We're good to go.
[02:35:49.660 --> 02:35:51.961]  35, 40, 50 bucks for something similar.
[02:35:52.401 --> 02:35:54.322]  Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Complex.
[02:35:55.203 --> 02:35:58.784]  This is what I take personally to avoid the flesh-eating bacteria and the flu.
[02:35:59.144 --> 02:36:02.306]  The rest of it to boost my immune system and get my body going.
[02:36:02.826 --> 02:36:08.688]  You can buy two X2 nascent iodine bottles and get Ancient Defense absolutely free.
[02:36:09.529 --> 02:36:11.730]  That's a big savings right there.
[02:36:12.990 --> 02:36:13.931]  And lastly,
[02:36:15.185 --> 02:36:21.151]  We have the entire line of My Patriot Supply foods that are some of the best out there.
[02:36:21.611 --> 02:36:26.896]  They have organic lines, they have vegan lines, they have other special diet lines.
[02:36:27.477 --> 02:36:31.361]  They come in a proprietary tote boxes that are very high quality.
[02:36:31.821 --> 02:36:32.942]  Stores have a 25 years.
[02:36:33.243 --> 02:36:37.026]  When you purchase your storable foods, you get the highest discounts available.
[02:36:37.066 --> 02:36:37.887]  They change every week.
[02:36:37.927 --> 02:36:43.252]  We change them every week from MyPatriotSupply at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:36:43.292 --> 02:36:47.797]  That's InfoWarsStore.com and it's insurance you can eat.
[02:36:48.237 --> 02:36:49.778]  The system wants us dependent.
[02:36:50.379 --> 02:36:52.840]  They don't want us to have any more food than three days.
[02:36:53.301 --> 02:36:54.361]  That's what they recommend we have.
[02:36:54.421 --> 02:36:58.703]  It's obvious that this is just as vital as water filtration and firearms.
[02:36:59.244 --> 02:37:01.305]  Invest in your food security today.
[02:37:01.325 --> 02:37:08.028]  InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[02:37:09.937 --> 02:37:14.739]  2-5-3, 3-1-3-9, we can answer all of your questions.
[02:37:15.199 --> 02:37:26.163]  We have their full range of food there, the exact same specials, but we are able to get more capital to fund the operation when you buy it directly from us and then they drop ship it.
[02:37:26.963 --> 02:37:29.484]  And the great part about MyPatriotSupply is they ship within just a few days.
[02:37:29.524 --> 02:37:30.624]  They really are wonderful people.
[02:37:31.325 --> 02:37:35.626]  Let's go back to Kelly in Texas on the whole radar situation.
[02:37:36.086 --> 02:37:37.147]  Isn't it frustrating?
[02:37:38.007 --> 02:37:45.458]  I remember my grandfather telling me about almost getting in fistfights in East Texas, West Texas, and New Mexico.
[02:37:46.894 --> 02:38:02.318]  As an oil company leash hound, because the only place to get a chicken fried steak was military bases out in West Texas, and he'd almost get in fights with Nazis who would shoot their mouths off at the restaurant bar and say, you know, we'd have kicked your asses and stuff like that.
[02:38:02.338 --> 02:38:06.039]  I remember him telling me that when I was like six years old and thinking he was crazy.
[02:38:06.619 --> 02:38:11.000]  You know, yeah, Nazis are, he said some of the bases, there were more Nazis than US troops.
[02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:16.321]  And it just really freaked him out because they put most of them in the Southwest.
[02:38:17.455 --> 02:38:24.487]  And then you tell people today that 36,000 top Nazis were brought here to run NASA, the CIA, the universities, everything.
[02:38:24.708 --> 02:38:25.609]  They just laugh at you.
[02:38:27.212 --> 02:38:29.516]  They go, oh, that's in Captain America Winter Soldier.
[02:38:29.536 --> 02:38:30.197]  That's not real.
[02:38:31.960 --> 02:38:36.703]  And then you tell them, hey, yeah, on blimps and helicopters, they got stuff that sees through your walls.
[02:38:36.723 --> 02:38:57.493]  Well, to condition the public now, they show a 20-year-old device that's been out there for 15 years that just tells them if a person's moving in a hostage situation, which gets you ready to accept, once you accept this x-ray machine, then you'll accept the high-powered ones on blimps that see everything going on in your house and are also cancer-causing, or having you drive through them.
[02:38:57.834 --> 02:38:59.094]  So that's the whole point of this.
[02:38:59.334 --> 02:39:00.175]  Go ahead and finish your point.
[02:39:02.579 --> 02:39:06.461]  How do you decide if what you're doing is right or wrong?
[02:39:06.781 --> 02:39:13.765]  If somebody decides you're doing something wrong, then they're going to use this technology to exploit you in any way that they can.
[02:39:14.656 --> 02:39:17.677]  So they're going to use that tool to their advantage.
[02:39:17.997 --> 02:39:20.517]  I'll tell you a story that happened about 16 years ago.
[02:39:20.537 --> 02:39:24.678]  I was told this by a member of the police department.
[02:39:24.698 --> 02:39:25.319]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:39:26.059 --> 02:39:28.840]  There was an old retired UT professor of fish.
[02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:29.980]  I forget the scientific name of that.
[02:39:30.020 --> 02:39:31.860]  I know an ornithologist's birds.
[02:39:32.740 --> 02:39:36.321]  And she had like 30-something fish tanks in her house.
[02:39:37.342 --> 02:39:38.622]  Well, they SWAT team raided her.
[02:39:40.242 --> 02:39:43.825]  And didn't find any drugs, she wasn't home, so they put a note on the door.
[02:39:44.585 --> 02:39:47.047]  And I'm laughing, do you know why they SWAT teamed her?
[02:39:47.167 --> 02:39:47.948]  Her power bill.
[02:39:48.728 --> 02:39:52.831]  It said her house only had one person, so why was her power bill so high?
[02:39:54.693 --> 02:40:03.199]  Well, an ichthologist, as I pronounce it from Greek, meaning fish, had a lot of power.
[02:40:03.219 --> 02:40:04.260]  I mean, I got a fish tank.
[02:40:05.423 --> 02:40:08.185]  I have a saltwater tank I got for the kids.
[02:40:08.565 --> 02:40:09.245]  It's a big one.
[02:40:09.265 --> 02:40:10.666]  I mean, not too big.
[02:40:10.726 --> 02:40:12.848]  And that sucker increased my power bill by a third.
[02:40:12.868 --> 02:40:14.168]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[02:40:14.328 --> 02:40:18.931]  That's not evidence that somebody's using a bunch of power to SWAT team them, looking for drugs.
[02:40:19.211 --> 02:40:20.592]  The government shipped in to begin with.
[02:40:20.912 --> 02:40:21.633]  Anything else, Kelly?
[02:40:22.833 --> 02:40:23.514]  Yeah.
[02:40:23.754 --> 02:40:26.155]  I wanted to ask you a question about the Oxy-Powder.
[02:40:26.555 --> 02:40:27.216]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:27.856 --> 02:40:34.280]  I was diagnosed about a year ago with what my doctor calls a paralyzed stomach.
[02:40:35.539 --> 02:40:39.401]  Um, which means that my food and stuff doesn't properly flow through me.
[02:40:40.282 --> 02:40:43.903]  And, um, I was wondering if you thought that stuff might actually help me.
[02:40:43.923 --> 02:40:51.828]  Well, sir, I'm not a medical doctor, but you've got all sorts of disorders where enzymes aren't created, where people aren't able to dissolve things.
[02:40:52.388 --> 02:40:53.388]  I would change your diet.
[02:40:53.408 --> 02:40:54.129]  I would chew more.
[02:40:54.169 --> 02:40:55.990]  I'm sure they told you that I would drink more water.
[02:40:56.869 --> 02:40:58.049]  But I'd talk to your physician.
[02:40:58.329 --> 02:41:00.430]  They'll usually tell you surgery and, you know, won't tell you stuff.
[02:41:01.010 --> 02:41:06.411]  I can tell you this, Oxy-Powder is the most dramatic product of a field of dramatic products.
[02:41:06.791 --> 02:41:09.632]  And Infowarslife.com, I wish it was proprietary to us.
[02:41:09.912 --> 02:41:11.012]  It's Dr. Gribb's product.
[02:41:11.793 --> 02:41:13.513]  It is life-changing.
[02:41:14.733 --> 02:41:18.034]  It's just oxygen to a higher level, so it releases in the intestines.
[02:41:18.794 --> 02:41:21.155]  And, I mean, what do you got to lose?
[02:41:21.235 --> 02:41:22.775]  It'll definitely help your intestines.
[02:41:23.635 --> 02:41:24.276]  It's dramatic.
[02:41:24.316 --> 02:41:25.496]  I mean, have you gotten the product yet?
[02:41:26.838 --> 02:41:27.440]  No, I haven't.
[02:41:27.480 --> 02:41:29.948]  I was wondering if y'all were going to run another special on it again.
[02:41:29.968 --> 02:41:31.754]  I wish I could.
[02:41:31.774 --> 02:41:33.278]  I mean, it actually costs group.
[02:41:35.162 --> 02:41:35.342]  I don't
[02:41:58.326 --> 02:42:00.467]  And I can barely fund the operation as it is.
[02:42:01.508 --> 02:42:05.290]  But I tell you, we'll try to get a new special soon, okay?
[02:42:06.430 --> 02:42:07.071]  Okay, thank you.
[02:42:07.451 --> 02:42:07.851]  Thank you.
[02:42:07.891 --> 02:42:16.055]  Yeah, these are... When I go to these big nutraceutical companies, because I don't just use GRIP, I use two other big, big, top labs in the country, top factories.
[02:42:17.216 --> 02:42:20.097]  We have the CEOs calling us, and they go, you're the type of people we're looking for.
[02:42:20.117 --> 02:42:22.418]  Because they supply Whole Foods, you name it, all the big people.
[02:42:23.179 --> 02:42:24.640]  They go, we love what you're doing.
[02:42:25.080 --> 02:42:26.340]  You're so, such a purist.
[02:42:26.400 --> 02:42:26.721]  I mean, you're...
[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:34.383]  You're putting $65 of money into your, or more, into your DNA force?
[02:42:34.623 --> 02:42:35.103]  Wow!
[02:42:36.063 --> 02:42:39.205]  Other people would put $5 in a top brand thing and sell it for $200.
[02:42:39.425 --> 02:42:42.986]  I mean, we put our money where our mouth is.
[02:42:43.026 --> 02:42:45.167]  We still put a markup on it.
[02:42:45.227 --> 02:42:46.688]  You know.
[02:42:46.748 --> 02:42:47.508]  This stuff's real.
[02:42:47.528 --> 02:42:48.668]  There's a reason it's popular.
[02:42:48.928 --> 02:42:52.490]  Plus, if I was just a cynical bad guy, I'd want to sell you stuff that knocks your socks off.
[02:42:53.168 --> 02:42:56.209]  Because then you'll want to buy it more, and we'll dominate the market.
[02:42:56.489 --> 02:43:03.332]  But see, there's such an idea in the corporate world that, no, we'll have slick marketing and make folks think this is doing something for them.
[02:43:03.512 --> 02:43:05.252]  Well, that just discredits the industry!
[02:43:05.973 --> 02:43:07.173]  Shell quality!
[02:43:07.533 --> 02:43:08.413]  Have a profit!
[02:43:09.254 --> 02:43:10.434]  It's called Americana.
[02:43:10.454 --> 02:43:13.855]  I've got to skip this network break, because I've got to play these two pieces and go to your calls.
[02:43:14.516 --> 02:43:20.338]  David Knight, and he's not asking for praise, because all the reporters, Leanne McAdoo, everybody, Jakari Jackson,
[02:43:21.391 --> 02:43:21.812]  All of them.
[02:43:21.892 --> 02:43:22.874]  I can't single them all out.
[02:43:23.635 --> 02:43:24.417]  Paul Watson, everybody.
[02:43:24.437 --> 02:43:25.058]  They're just amazing.
[02:43:25.098 --> 02:43:27.001]  But David Knight has been here about a year and a half.
[02:43:27.722 --> 02:43:30.367]  He moved down here from the Carolinas with his family.
[02:43:31.369 --> 02:43:34.615]  And he just is doing a superlative job.
[02:43:35.595 --> 02:43:41.860]  Just a superlative job and we really appreciate him and he just does such an on-target analysis.
[02:43:42.280 --> 02:43:44.982]  Here is real journalism breaking down the State of the Union.
[02:43:45.342 --> 02:43:46.803]  This is the State of the Union Decoded.
[02:43:47.123 --> 02:43:50.045]  We'll retweet it out on Twitter in about five minutes at Real Alex Jones.
[02:43:50.326 --> 02:43:51.586]  Get this out to your friends and family.
[02:43:51.627 --> 02:43:51.987]  Here it is.
[02:43:52.467 --> 02:43:55.930]  Advising the Congress of the State of the Union is a constitutional requirement.
[02:43:56.610 --> 02:44:07.335]  And for most of the history of this country, it was done very simply, but under FDR, it became a public event, and now it's become a massive PR stunt, a massive commercial for the President.
[02:44:07.736 --> 02:44:20.622]  Now, Obama took this to all new levels last night as he did a live PowerPoint presentation, twisting the statistics, twisting the facts, to present a case that we have never been more prosperous or more peaceful.
[02:44:21.763 --> 02:44:25.845]  We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet.
[02:44:26.789 --> 02:44:29.751]  And today, America is number one in oil and gas.
[02:44:30.271 --> 02:44:40.858]  But the broad themes that he's been talking about all week were redistribution of wealth from the rich to the middle class, and of course, two years of community college free for everyone.
[02:44:41.359 --> 02:44:46.222]  Noticeably absent from the State of the Union were any details about his policy proposals.
[02:44:46.782 --> 02:44:50.325]  But the devil is in the details, and so are the lies.
[02:44:50.865 --> 02:44:56.029]  As we'll see from the details, both the redistribution and the free college themes are lies.
[02:44:56.529 --> 02:45:02.853]  But there are two other areas that haven't been looked at as closely, and they will change the world that you live in.
[02:45:03.334 --> 02:45:13.621]  That's the trade treaties that are currently being negotiated secretly and fast-tracked, and the control of the Internet and new draconian felonies for the Internet.
[02:45:13.901 --> 02:45:14.922]  First, the lies.
[02:45:15.382 --> 02:45:19.725]  He will make two years of college as free and as universal as high school.
[02:45:20.286 --> 02:45:28.132]  But if you look beyond the headline of the White House press release, you'll see that he's only proposing 75% of the tuition be paid by the federal government.
[02:45:28.492 --> 02:45:30.234]  So he's lying when he says it's free.
[02:45:30.254 --> 02:45:37.939]  Now, of course, there's no such thing as a free lunch or a free government education unless you've never paid property taxes and never will.
[02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:44.825]  Anybody who has paid property taxes knows that it is by far the largest part of your local taxes.
[02:45:45.225 --> 02:45:51.210]  If you don't pay them directly, if you rent from someone, you're not going to see those costs, but they are in the cost of your rent.
[02:45:51.771 --> 02:46:04.581]  But the thing that I find most troubling is that while on the one hand, Obama is lying about a free government education, he is also taking with the other hand the middle classes' education savings accounts.
[02:46:04.881 --> 02:46:09.003]  The government has offered the middle class a couple of ways that parents can save for their children's education.
[02:46:09.543 --> 02:46:21.587]  Saving after-tax dollars into an education fund, and if that fund grows in value because of the investment, the gain will not be taxed when they apply it to their children's education.
[02:46:22.188 --> 02:46:25.029]  Now Obama is proposing to tax those plans.
[02:46:25.049 --> 02:46:30.871]  They're called 529 plans, and also to end the Coverdale Education Savings Account.
[02:46:31.611 --> 02:46:36.633]  Now, that punishes families that save money to invest in their children's education.
[02:46:37.313 --> 02:46:48.858]  And most importantly, it betrays those who have worked hard, who have saved, who have relied on the government promise that the education savings would not be stolen by the tax man.
[02:46:53.200 --> 02:47:02.904]  The entire globalist constellation attack, the reason the police state's being put in place, because they know you're going to get angry, is they're going to take all the pension funds, all the 401Ks when they're done.
[02:47:02.944 --> 02:47:03.604]  That's been announced.
[02:47:03.924 --> 02:47:06.566]  And they've done it in every other country they get control of.
[02:47:08.066 --> 02:47:13.428]  So that's why they want FEMA camps and SWAT teams and all of this to be expanded.
[02:47:15.089 --> 02:47:19.651]  But the police themselves, just like in Greece and Spain, are going to be looted.
[02:47:20.848 --> 02:47:24.351]  Now when they do it, they're going to take it over and tax it at first and federalize it.
[02:47:25.212 --> 02:47:31.076]  But then they'll start taking pieces of it, and by the time you retire, you will get maybe 20-30% of what you would have.
[02:47:31.677 --> 02:47:33.518]  This is a formula they follow.
[02:47:33.839 --> 02:47:35.040]  Please listen to me, okay?
[02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:36.261]  It's guaranteed!
[02:47:38.302 --> 02:47:39.183]  It's guaranteed!
[02:47:39.223 --> 02:47:40.804]  Are we just going to lay here and take this?
[02:47:41.825 --> 02:47:42.906]  After tax money?
[02:47:43.346 --> 02:47:44.367]  They're now going to steal that?
[02:47:46.149 --> 02:47:48.310]  They want to run our lives, people.
[02:47:49.204 --> 02:47:50.925]  It isn't about getting more money to run the government.
[02:47:51.885 --> 02:47:53.846]  It's about getting control of everybody.
[02:47:54.987 --> 02:48:00.390]  The Federal Reserve used to admit its biggest problem was, quote, keeping the economy from overheating and people becoming too wealthy.
[02:48:01.310 --> 02:48:07.293]  And now at Davos they lecture us on how we should become poor, as they bring all their hookers with them and fly in on giant aircraft.
[02:48:07.933 --> 02:48:08.994]  They're a bunch of pigs!
[02:48:10.575 --> 02:48:22.584]  They're the real pigs and they want us to go call the police pigs and get in fights with them so they'll hate the public and have a war with us because if the public ever gets with the police and local government, that's it for the New World Order!
[02:48:23.848 --> 02:48:24.728]  Pieces of garbage?
[02:48:24.948 --> 02:48:26.089]  Let's go back to his report.
[02:48:26.889 --> 02:48:31.910]  Now, that punishes families that save money to invest in their children's education.
[02:48:32.590 --> 02:48:44.153]  And most importantly, it betrays those who have worked hard, who have saved, who have relied on the government promise that the education savings would not be stolen by the tax man.
[02:48:44.733 --> 02:48:49.954]  This is really about punishing self-reliance and fostering a dependence on the state.
[02:48:50.554 --> 02:48:58.116]  And Obama has the audacity to say that he's taxing the rich, going after trust funds, helping the middle class.
[02:48:59.036 --> 02:49:02.737]  This is a massive betrayal of the middle class, if it were to pass.
[02:49:03.117 --> 02:49:05.858]  These education accounts are not trust funds.
[02:49:06.718 --> 02:49:08.099]  The average for the accounts is $21,000.
[02:49:08.420 --> 02:49:16.127]  This is not a Bill Gates trust fund and $21,000 isn't very much when you're trying to pay for college.
[02:49:16.848 --> 02:49:18.609]  Obama is not taking trust funds.
[02:49:19.170 --> 02:49:27.858]  What he is doing is betraying the trust of the middle class who thought that they would have a little bit of an opportunity to save for their children's education.
[02:49:28.238 --> 02:49:30.160]  But these proposals are not likely to pass.
[02:49:30.661 --> 02:49:31.862]  What is going to pass
[02:49:32.242 --> 02:49:37.527]  Will change your world, whether you are working class, middle class, or rich, and not for the better.
[02:49:37.847 --> 02:49:47.675]  If you want to know how much Obama really cares about the middle class and the working class, look carefully at the trade agreement that he's trying to fast-track with the help of the Republicans.
[02:49:48.116 --> 02:49:50.518]  Huffington Post asks, is this schizophrenia?
[02:49:50.658 --> 02:49:55.622]  Saying you're going to help the middle class while you destroy jobs by fast-tracking the TPP?
[02:49:56.063 --> 02:49:57.664]  No, it's not schizophrenia.
[02:49:58.064 --> 02:49:59.425]  It's simply a lie.
[02:50:00.086 --> 02:50:05.611]  But the Huffington Post and the liberal mainstream media can't bring themselves to call Obama a liar.
[02:50:05.931 --> 02:50:08.714]  Look at what the Guardian says without a hint of sarcasm.
[02:50:08.934 --> 02:50:16.741]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a trade agreement so significant and important its details can't be disclosed.
[02:50:17.081 --> 02:50:17.721]  Are you kidding me?
[02:50:18.422 --> 02:50:21.804]  I guess if we knew the secret details, they'd have to kill us.
[02:50:22.524 --> 02:50:28.908]  Anything that is that important, that significant, needs to be transparent and debated in public.
[02:50:29.388 --> 02:50:30.549]  But they're not about to do that.
[02:50:30.889 --> 02:50:35.812]  The liberal mainstream media wants to dance around the central issue of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[02:50:35.852 --> 02:50:40.655]  And that is, it's the next step in global corporate governance.
[02:50:41.135 --> 02:50:48.497]  Why isn't it a screaming red flag to them that no elected representatives can see the content of these secret treaties?
[02:50:48.978 --> 02:50:54.019]  Only multinational corporate lobbyists who are writing the treaty know what's in it.
[02:50:54.299 --> 02:50:58.861]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Agreement go far beyond trade.
[02:50:58.921 --> 02:51:01.301]  They rewrite copyright laws globally.
[02:51:01.621 --> 02:51:03.082]  They affect the freedom of the Internet.
[02:51:03.542 --> 02:51:12.846]  And they bypass our legal systems, giving special privileges to multinational corporations that neither individuals nor even domestic corporations have.
[02:51:13.206 --> 02:51:20.069]  Fast Track will not only rush the treaty through without public debate, it will block any and all changes to the document.
[02:51:20.889 --> 02:51:23.970]  Nothing should ever be passed this way.
[02:51:24.730 --> 02:51:38.594]  Now, the fact that the only thing we know for sure about the Trans-Pacific Partnership is what has been leaked by WikiLeaks is, I think, very telling, and the reason that Obama is going after the Internet in his fourth leg of his agenda.
[02:51:38.914 --> 02:51:42.797]  He's calling for total internet control and draconian new felonies for the internet.
[02:51:43.197 --> 02:51:45.659]  It's a multi-pronged attack against internet freedom.
[02:51:46.199 --> 02:51:48.320]  Regulatory control by the FCC.
[02:51:48.841 --> 02:51:52.823]  Corporations spying on you and reporting to the government, which they call CISPA.
[02:51:53.544 --> 02:51:57.006]  New crimes and draconian penalties for the new crimes.
[02:51:57.526 --> 02:52:02.470]  Remember what I just said about the education proposals where the feds would give with one hand and take with the other?
[02:52:02.990 --> 02:52:12.633]  Now they're telling us, well, you can have net neutrality, but that's going to come through the FCC being appointed as king of the Internet, as the regulator of the Internet.
[02:52:13.053 --> 02:52:15.314]  Now, of course, we've always had net neutrality.
[02:52:15.354 --> 02:52:16.775]  We didn't need the FCC for that.
[02:52:17.255 --> 02:52:20.856]  And the FCC has been on both sides of net neutrality.
[02:52:21.336 --> 02:52:22.817]  It isn't about net neutrality.
[02:52:22.857 --> 02:52:30.919]  Whatever you think about it, it's all about giving the FCC control of the Internet, making them the regulators of the Internet.
[02:52:30.939 --> 02:52:31.320]  That's right.
[02:52:31.360 --> 02:52:32.160]  And once they are,
[02:52:32.620 --> 02:52:35.721]  They can change net neutrality in a heartbeat.
[02:52:35.901 --> 02:52:36.941]  Then there's CISPA.
[02:52:37.782 --> 02:52:41.363]  Cyber Intelligence Sharing Protection Act.
[02:52:41.843 --> 02:52:49.346]  Every time Obama talks about the internet, he now talks about cyber intelligence sharing, especially since the Sony hack involving the interview.
[02:52:50.006 --> 02:52:56.568]  CISPA's primary function is to grant legal immunity to corporations that turn all of your data over to the government.
[02:52:57.068 --> 02:52:59.270]  Well, of course, they've been doing that for quite some time.
[02:52:59.450 --> 02:53:01.352]  It's not about protecting you.
[02:53:01.752 --> 02:53:07.417]  It's all about giving these snitches legal protection and removing your right to sue them.
[02:53:07.757 --> 02:53:12.241]  CISPA has been defeated twice, but the Republicans love it, and so does Obama.
[02:53:12.741 --> 02:53:16.364]  Now, it looks like this Orwellian love child is going to be birthed.
[02:53:16.824 --> 02:53:22.489]  Then there's the changes to the CFAA, the computer fraud... We've got to stop it there, because I promised to go to calls.
[02:53:23.130 --> 02:53:24.491]  It's a very powerful report.
[02:53:24.511 --> 02:53:25.492]  We just retweeted it.
[02:53:26.443 --> 02:53:29.865]  At RealAlexJones on Twitter, please retweet it to everyone you know.
[02:53:29.885 --> 02:53:36.968]  He just goes through, for radio listeners, he shows the legislation, he shows the documents, he shows the areas highlighted.
[02:53:38.208 --> 02:53:39.128]  First class report.
[02:53:41.309 --> 02:53:49.373]  Just praise God, because all I wanted to do was find good minds, good reporters, so we could fight the globalists more, cover more issues, and we're doing that now.
[02:53:50.333 --> 02:53:53.975]  I kind of yell and scream and run around getting everybody's attention, and the reporters can educate everybody.
[02:53:55.120 --> 02:53:56.641]  Of course, I inform and educate as well.
[02:53:56.701 --> 02:54:02.967]  It's just that I just believe in humanity and I know we can beat these people.
[02:54:04.568 --> 02:54:07.010]  But you've got to understand how bad the New World Order is, folks.
[02:54:07.051 --> 02:54:07.911]  They're really evil.
[02:54:09.232 --> 02:54:10.754]  And I wish I wasn't right about all this.
[02:54:10.814 --> 02:54:12.235]  My God, I wish it wasn't real.
[02:54:15.618 --> 02:54:16.319]  Let's go to calls.
[02:54:16.439 --> 02:54:18.200]  Ron in Vermont and Nick and others.
[02:54:18.621 --> 02:54:19.822]  Ron, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:54:21.474 --> 02:54:23.195]  Wow, you are on fire.
[02:54:23.396 --> 02:54:25.057]  Your crew is on fire.
[02:54:25.397 --> 02:54:27.379]  Everyone there does an excellent job.
[02:54:27.539 --> 02:54:32.883]  I tell you, you are channeling the Southern Baptist Reverend in you today.
[02:54:33.023 --> 02:54:34.204]  It's unbelievable.
[02:54:34.344 --> 02:54:38.507]  And I know why your crew would, you know, crash through walls for you.
[02:54:38.547 --> 02:54:39.668]  God bless them all.
[02:54:40.909 --> 02:54:43.851]  I'd like to say something about the Matrix.
[02:54:43.911 --> 02:54:48.415]  If you don't think you're in the Matrix, there's something wrong with you because
[02:54:49.099 --> 02:55:00.229]  You know, if you watch that movie and you see when Neo finally gets to the end and he's talking to the guy and you know, and the guy tells him, you know, you think you're the first Neo?
[02:55:00.919 --> 02:55:04.020]  You're like the 70th Neo that got here.
[02:55:04.501 --> 02:55:12.504]  And each time, you know, you come up with a plan to thwart us, we just write a new program.
[02:55:13.144 --> 02:55:16.806]  And that's what's happening decade after decade.
[02:55:16.826 --> 02:55:19.287]  And that guy he talks to is the archetype of Lucifer.
[02:55:21.616 --> 02:55:22.377]  It's incredible.
[02:55:22.617 --> 02:55:35.655]  I grew up in the 60s, you know, and the music of the 60s, folk music, Bob Dylan, Peter, Paul and Mary, the song Blowing in the Wind, these songs, these words changed the course
[02:55:36.195 --> 02:55:36.696]  I don't
[02:55:55.998 --> 02:56:12.508]  It scared them so much, the real protest music of the 60s, that they came out with clones of it to just turn folks into a bunch of scum that rebelling is becoming a criminal instead of listening to those incredible songs that are about being a human being and not being a sellout.
[02:56:12.528 --> 02:56:13.329]  You're absolutely right.
[02:56:14.806 --> 02:56:18.988]  You have Oprah Winfrey, you know, doing, oh, she's doing so much good.
[02:56:19.028 --> 02:56:24.231]  You know, look, she's in Africa, you know, helping all these really smart kids.
[02:56:24.491 --> 02:56:28.533]  Yeah, but these smart kids don't grow up to invent things for themselves.
[02:56:28.593 --> 02:56:34.916]  They go into, oh, the Heritage Foundation, things that are going to imprison me later on.
[02:56:35.256 --> 02:56:36.376]  And I've had it.
[02:56:36.757 --> 02:56:39.138]  And I tell you, I'd like to ask a question.
[02:56:40.098 --> 02:56:55.008]  You know, if my parents was a globalist, and I'm growing up, and I hear Infowars.com, God, wouldn't you want to know the truth and go back on your parents somehow?
[02:56:55.308 --> 02:56:58.330]  These people are sociopaths.
[02:56:58.450 --> 02:57:01.532]  And I can tell you this from personal experience.
[02:57:01.933 --> 02:57:09.518]  I sat in, unfortunately, there's some mental illness that I have to deal with in my family, and I was sitting in a NAMI group one day,
[02:57:10.158 --> 02:57:17.505]  Uh, with, with families and all of a sudden the last person says, well, you know, I'm not a family member.
[02:57:17.765 --> 02:57:21.928]  I am a mentally ill and I am a psychopath.
[02:57:22.989 --> 02:57:32.738]  And the hair on everybody's back of their, their necks stood up because the things that he started to say was like,
[02:57:33.448 --> 02:57:34.088]  I'll lie.
[02:57:34.248 --> 02:57:37.310]  I'll do anything I need to do to get my way.
[02:57:37.550 --> 02:57:38.530]  I don't feel.
[02:57:38.550 --> 02:57:41.611]  I don't really laugh.
[02:57:41.912 --> 02:57:44.433]  I don't really... I have no concern.
[02:57:44.453 --> 02:57:49.695]  I live off the fear and the emotions of other people.
[02:57:49.815 --> 02:57:52.636]  Basically, these people are robots.
[02:57:52.756 --> 02:57:54.597]  They have no sanity.
[02:57:55.037 --> 02:57:57.258]  And that's why they are so jealous.
[02:57:57.538 --> 02:58:00.079]  They want something that they can never have.
[02:58:00.199 --> 02:58:01.700]  You're a powerful caller, Ron.
[02:58:01.740 --> 02:58:03.923]  I gotta jump and get to Nick and others, but God bless you.
[02:58:03.943 --> 02:58:21.960]  We're gonna have to go into overdrive to finish some of these calls, but I've had top psychiatrists on, famously, I forget her name, that is the one that talks to all the top psychopath killers, and they say they're like robots that are really scared and have nightmares and are totally unhappy, and they only know how to manipulate, but then when they're killing someone, it's like they're possessed, and there's white light and they feel good.
[02:58:22.260 --> 02:58:23.161]  That's why they want to kill.
[02:58:23.201 --> 02:58:24.222]  Well, they are possessed.
[02:58:24.282 --> 02:58:25.123]  I mean, that's what it is.
[02:58:26.043 --> 02:58:26.584]  They're possessed.
[02:58:26.944 --> 02:58:28.605]  Call it whatever you want, they are possessed.
[02:58:28.985 --> 02:58:30.126]  Something is filling them up.
[02:58:31.567 --> 02:58:41.733]  And I know somebody that grew up with the DuPonts in Pennsylvania and other areas, and they were all basically devil worshippers.
[02:58:41.753 --> 02:58:43.594]  I'm gonna see if I can get that person on air to tell the story.
[02:58:44.374 --> 02:58:45.515]  He has that movie Foxcatcher.
[02:58:45.535 --> 02:58:46.776]  I mean, you know, these people don't play games.
[02:58:47.316 --> 02:58:48.057]  They don't play games.
[02:58:48.517 --> 02:58:49.677]  Devil worshippers.
[02:58:49.758 --> 02:58:50.058]  Outright.
[02:58:51.072 --> 02:58:52.196]  Stay with us, this is from overdrive.
[02:58:52.637 --> 02:58:53.561]  I'm gonna go to Nick and others.
[02:59:00.994 --> 02:59:02.035]  In the near future.
[02:59:02.335 --> 02:59:06.497]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:59:06.837 --> 02:59:07.818]  Security alert.
[02:59:08.058 --> 02:59:09.799]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:59:10.059 --> 02:59:10.679]  Analysis.
[02:59:10.940 --> 02:59:13.621]  InfoWars building into media operations.
[02:59:13.641 --> 02:59:18.624]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:59:18.644 --> 02:59:19.584]  Crime directive.
[02:59:19.684 --> 02:59:21.105]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:59:21.225 --> 02:59:24.047]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:59:24.067 --> 02:59:27.169]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:59:27.329 --> 02:59:29.490]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:59:29.650 --> 02:59:31.111]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:59:31.131 --> 02:59:33.212]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:59:33.292 --> 02:59:35.614]  They are never going to stop.
[02:59:35.914 --> 02:59:39.816]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:59:39.956 --> 02:59:43.138]  Block free iPhone ads at InfoWars.com.
[02:59:43.578 --> 02:59:46.220]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[02:59:46.920 --> 02:59:47.661]  Imperative.
[02:59:47.901 --> 02:59:49.922]  Deploy criminal senate TV.
[02:59:49.962 --> 02:59:54.345]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:59:54.645 --> 02:59:55.986]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[02:59:56.006 --> 02:59:56.746]  You can feel it.
[03:00:02.435 --> 03:00:08.617]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:08.657 --> 03:00:11.397]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[03:00:11.577 --> 03:00:14.498]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[03:00:14.518 --> 03:00:22.680]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[03:00:22.720 --> 03:00:25.701]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.761 --> 03:00:29.022]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate.
[03:00:30.081 --> 03:00:36.368]  I was listening to a record of live.
[03:00:38.229 --> 03:00:39.170]  George Stray, even better.
[03:00:41.953 --> 03:00:46.658]  Rallying patriots in defense of human liberty, that's all I'm trying to do, is we're all in this together.
[03:00:47.038 --> 03:00:49.481]  Nick in Pennsylvania, thanks for holding your on the air, welcome.
[03:00:50.644 --> 03:00:51.645]  God bless you, Alex.
[03:00:52.225 --> 03:01:05.654]  I wanted to talk to you a little bit about this Chris Kyle guy, this known bearer of false witness, American Manhunter, and the irony behind calling him American Sniper.
[03:01:05.694 --> 03:01:10.117]  That's hilarious if you live on the East Coast and remember the whole D.C.
[03:01:10.137 --> 03:01:10.838]  Sniper thing.
[03:01:11.158 --> 03:01:14.320]  They use those same words to strike fear into everybody in this area.
[03:01:14.915 --> 03:01:26.402]  But anyway, this guy, he founded a company called Kraft International, which is basically like a black ops front group government contractor for drills.
[03:01:26.423 --> 03:01:30.745]  And they were spotted all over the whole Boston Marathon bombing hoax.
[03:01:30.885 --> 03:01:39.271]  Well, people wearing their uniform and hats were, I'm not saying they were involved, but yeah, no, he was, that might have been why they killed him was to cover that up.
[03:01:40.270 --> 03:01:43.417]  Yeah, they have, their hats have the exact skull logo.
[03:01:43.518 --> 03:01:47.166]  If you go to their website, it's called craftthecraft.com.
[03:01:47.206 --> 03:01:49.932]  No, no, it's a Punisher with blood dripping off the eye.
[03:01:50.822 --> 03:01:58.325]  Yeah, and The Craft is specifically the term used to describe the lower level of the Freemasonry.
[03:01:58.405 --> 03:02:07.748]  But anyway, and the website itself goes on to talk about how their logo is based off of the Templar Cross, which also has a direct connection to Freemasonry.
[03:02:07.768 --> 03:02:11.509]  No, I know, clearly he was in the Masonry, that's pretty clear.
[03:02:12.677 --> 03:02:31.561]  Yeah, they were spotted on the ground at the Boston Marathon bombing, and they've got their uniforms, their skull logo on their hat, the backpack matches, the backpack that they said was evidence of the bomb going off, but that whole thing was a complete Hollywood tie-up, completely fake if you look into it at all.
[03:02:31.661 --> 03:02:33.341]  And look how it worked out for Chris Kyle!
[03:02:34.502 --> 03:02:34.682]  Yep.
[03:02:35.322 --> 03:02:36.562]  Yep, and he's dead now.
[03:02:36.862 --> 03:02:40.983]  So anyone who wants to do those kind of things to our country, you know,
[03:02:41.673 --> 03:02:43.614]  You ain't particularly safe afterwards.
[03:02:43.794 --> 03:02:51.316]  And many of the people involved in Sandy Hook are having their lives exposed to the whole world for being in on that fraud.
[03:02:51.496 --> 03:02:55.698]  So, you know, it's not a particularly safe line of business.
[03:02:55.918 --> 03:02:56.418]  No, I hear you.
[03:02:56.438 --> 03:03:00.099]  The most dangerous position to be in is working for the New World Order.
[03:03:00.959 --> 03:03:02.900]  I mean, it is just unbelievable.
[03:03:03.480 --> 03:03:06.021]  And it's a big hoax that you can't get into that and get out of it.
[03:03:06.381 --> 03:03:09.282]  Most people get out of it once they get into really evil stuff.
[03:03:10.339 --> 03:03:14.161]  So that thing about you never get out of the CIA, you never get out of special ops.
[03:03:14.361 --> 03:03:14.681]  Bull.
[03:03:15.662 --> 03:03:15.962]  Bull.
[03:03:16.803 --> 03:03:17.443]  That's bull.
[03:03:18.423 --> 03:03:19.444]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:19.884 --> 03:03:21.105]  Let's go to Steve in Florida.
[03:03:21.265 --> 03:03:21.905]  Steve, you're on the air.
[03:03:21.925 --> 03:03:25.407]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex.
[03:03:25.707 --> 03:03:30.970]  Real quick, I wanted to point something out, and this will help people out in dealing with what's going on with America.
[03:03:30.990 --> 03:03:34.712]  There's a spiritual and a natural parallel.
[03:03:34.792 --> 03:03:35.613]  Here's where I'm getting at.
[03:03:36.542 --> 03:03:40.844]  It's been said that the Church is the conscience of the nation, so I'm talking about Christianity.
[03:03:41.604 --> 03:03:51.388]  Because there's been a corruption of the Bible and doctrine, we've had an acceptance of deception and lies with the higher criticism and the perversion of the Word of God.
[03:03:51.408 --> 03:03:59.451]  The natural outcome is the rise of the dumbing down of our education system with evolution, sex ed, Common Core, etc.
[03:04:00.011 --> 03:04:06.234]  We've also had the corruption of the Church's worship with their fake Pentecostalism and so-called Christian entertainment.
[03:04:06.755 --> 03:04:13.119]  So in the natural, we've had the rise of Hollywood, the TV and music industry, the virtual reality versus life reality.
[03:04:13.179 --> 03:04:14.780]  That's right.
[03:04:15.040 --> 03:04:24.686]  If you take God out of it, flooding in is the worst of the worst that will take four and then force-feed our children demoniac garbage to enslave them.
[03:04:26.001 --> 03:04:31.866]  Yeah, we've also had the corruption of the church's thinking with so-called Christian psychology, which makes self-God.
[03:04:32.466 --> 03:04:34.808]  Well, we've had the rise of Freudian and Jungian... Oh, I know.
[03:04:34.848 --> 03:04:43.375]  I cannot tell you what it's done with people I know with these name-it-and-claim-it brainwasher churches that turn people into, like, psychopaths.
[03:04:43.415 --> 03:04:45.897]  They believe they can do anything they want because God's on their side.
[03:04:45.957 --> 03:04:46.978]  It is bizarre.
[03:04:48.693 --> 03:04:55.556]  And, uh, we've also had the corruption of the church at stand with this preacher of rapture fantasy rather than fight on and endure to the end.
[03:04:55.597 --> 03:04:56.537]  Yeah, I'm gonna come back to you.
[03:04:56.557 --> 03:04:57.537]  I'm gonna keep doing Overdrive.
[03:04:57.577 --> 03:05:00.659]  Steve, stay there and then Ed, Randy, and that'll be it for calls.
[03:05:00.719 --> 03:05:05.241]  I'm gonna keep going for Ed and Randy and Steve and a few final news stories straight ahead.
[03:05:05.421 --> 03:05:06.302]  Overdrive continues.
[03:05:12.202 --> 03:05:13.704]  Are you always five minutes late?
[03:05:14.164 --> 03:05:16.506]  Maybe you're only late when you don't want to be somewhere.
[03:05:16.947 --> 03:05:19.169]  Then you realize you're always five minutes late.
[03:05:19.650 --> 03:05:25.916]  For work, you set three alarms, drag your feet in the shower, drink your coffee slowly until you're rushing out the door.
[03:05:26.276 --> 03:05:27.277]  Five minutes late.
[03:05:27.618 --> 03:05:29.079]  It's not that you hate your job.
[03:05:29.099 --> 03:05:30.721]  Hate is such a strong word.
[03:05:30.961 --> 03:05:32.703]  You're just not that excited about it.
[03:05:33.163 --> 03:05:35.365]  But most people don't love what they do, right?
[03:05:35.786 --> 03:05:48.379]  Listen, if you're local to the Twin Cities, are hardworking, self-driven, with experience in sales, marketing, or advertising, are personable, and a whiz on the phone, you might want to join one of the largest independent talk radio networks in the world, GCN.

[03:08:08.993 --> 03:08:24.240]  You are listening to an Infowars.com Frontline Report.
[03:08:25.200 --> 03:08:28.822]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistant
[03:08:38.464 --> 03:08:39.625]  Alright, let's hurry through your calls.
[03:08:39.665 --> 03:08:40.806]  We're in overdrive here.
[03:08:41.346 --> 03:08:43.408]  Taking your calls on a few other stories I want to hit on.
[03:08:43.428 --> 03:08:50.333]  To show how conditioned I've gotten, they're at Davos on TV talking about micro-mosquitoes that'll force us to take our shots.
[03:08:50.813 --> 03:08:53.575]  They're saying, get over it, you have no privacy, as they announce each year.
[03:08:54.716 --> 03:08:58.459]  And I'm just so conditioned, I'm like, yeah, they're announcing micro-mosquitoes, robots, huh?
[03:08:59.280 --> 03:08:59.840]  Eh, big deal.
[03:09:00.901 --> 03:09:03.383]  See, first it doesn't exist, and now, oh, it's just no big deal.
[03:09:03.403 --> 03:09:04.584]  And even I'm being conditioned.
[03:09:04.604 --> 03:09:06.325]  It's just amazing.
[03:09:06.385 --> 03:09:07.206]  Steve, um...
[03:09:10.285 --> 03:09:11.006]  Absolutely.
[03:09:11.066 --> 03:09:15.648]  You know, they talk about religion being used for wars and not spirituality or not a belief in Christ.
[03:09:16.709 --> 03:09:19.111]  But you look at these big mega-churches.
[03:09:19.191 --> 03:09:21.412]  They're just government intelligence agencies.
[03:09:22.713 --> 03:09:34.640]  And they take normal people and then get them all hyped up to be super confident and believe they can act or do whatever they want because Jesus is going to reward them because they go to that church.
[03:09:35.160 --> 03:09:37.202]  And it creates mentally ill monsters.
[03:09:38.195 --> 03:09:40.597]  It's almost like a type of narcissism they're teaching them.
[03:09:40.997 --> 03:09:44.219]  I noticed you mentioned that, and I have witnessed that myself.
[03:09:45.960 --> 03:09:48.081]  Yeah, I have a couple more real quick.
[03:09:48.361 --> 03:09:54.465]  There's been a corruption of the church's mission, which is the Great Commission, that's been neutralized, neglected.
[03:09:54.625 --> 03:09:59.327]  We've replaced it with this Kingdom Now church growth movement, focusing on our property, etc.
[03:09:59.768 --> 03:10:07.112]  While here in the natural, we have the rise of the laziness of the welfare EBT class, burning out our kids, our elderly, and our industry.
[03:10:07.839 --> 03:10:12.042]  And then the corruption of the Church's perspective, where it's temporal rather than eternal.
[03:10:12.462 --> 03:10:18.706]  Well, we've got the rise of the me generation and instant gratification, gotta have it now rather than think long-term.
[03:10:19.146 --> 03:10:26.511]  The corruption of the Church's stand with this pre-trib rapture fantasy rather than fight on and endure to the end.
[03:10:26.551 --> 03:10:31.674]  And so we've got the rise of the zombie nation with the sports, the game shows, the tabloid reality.
[03:10:32.235 --> 03:10:37.118]  And then finally, the corruption of the Church leadership with their greed, perversion, and egotism.
[03:10:37.625 --> 03:10:40.648]  So we had the rise of the criminal government and their dad tripped.
[03:10:42.530 --> 03:10:43.071]  Well said.
[03:10:43.091 --> 03:10:51.660]  I'm going to take the call you made earlier and then finishing up in this segment and put it out as a video because I think what you said is absolutely on target and it's scary.
[03:10:53.817 --> 03:10:57.138]  And I'm not, again, up here saying I'm some moral perfect person.
[03:10:57.238 --> 03:10:58.139]  I'm fleshly.
[03:10:58.739 --> 03:10:59.719]  I have bad thoughts.
[03:11:00.339 --> 03:11:02.860]  But, I mean, part of that is you war game things in your mind.
[03:11:02.880 --> 03:11:04.801]  I get in the mind of the enemy.
[03:11:05.221 --> 03:11:06.322]  I understand how they think.
[03:11:07.102 --> 03:11:18.026]  And then I look at just the stupid, dumbed-down, me-me-me people that just want to believe Obama's going to give them free college or a free car or a free house, and all the illegals worldwide coming here to get a free lunch.
[03:11:19.267 --> 03:11:21.309]  As if anybody's really going to get a free lunch.
[03:11:21.870 --> 03:11:24.113]  As if it isn't about creepy total enslavement.
[03:11:25.455 --> 03:11:32.423]  And even though they get lied to over and over again, they still bet again because they want to believe they're going to get something for free.
[03:11:34.192 --> 03:11:35.153]  They're just chumps.
[03:11:36.033 --> 03:11:38.716]  And then you see how soft and dumb the public's gotten.
[03:11:39.016 --> 03:11:40.237]  Part of industrialization.
[03:11:40.557 --> 03:11:41.838]  It's not all the globalists doing.
[03:11:42.138 --> 03:11:43.459]  They're just exacerbating it.
[03:11:44.160 --> 03:11:52.547]  Imagine when everything falls and goes to hell in a handbasket what it'll be like with these giant hordes of entitled, weak, pathetic people.
[03:11:53.347 --> 03:11:55.169]  And then all these fake, tough men.
[03:11:57.423 --> 03:12:01.986]  All these fake tough guys strutting around thinking they're Billy Badass.
[03:12:02.046 --> 03:12:06.109]  I mean, what's it going to be like for them when the, you know what, hits the oscillating device?
[03:12:06.509 --> 03:12:07.430]  It's going to be crazy.
[03:12:07.450 --> 03:12:07.970]  Anything else?
[03:12:09.471 --> 03:12:11.352]  Yeah, I just want to say this in conclusion.
[03:12:12.313 --> 03:12:17.276]  I'm not for perpetuating this, you know, self-fulfilling prophecy.
[03:12:17.316 --> 03:12:18.757]  Well, you know, it's the last day.
[03:12:18.837 --> 03:12:19.718]  God said this would happen.
[03:12:19.758 --> 03:12:20.778]  There's nothing we can do.
[03:12:20.798 --> 03:12:23.400]  I'm going to stand for the truth and fight on.
[03:12:23.440 --> 03:12:24.581]  But I want to say this, Alex.
[03:12:25.413 --> 03:12:34.401]  What we see happening in America is the judgment of God, not just on the nation, but on the church, because of their mockery of God before the law.
[03:12:34.981 --> 03:12:38.284]  And unless the church turns and changes the direction they're going,
[03:12:38.780 --> 03:12:54.709]  I believe we're going to see a total implosion of America, which I believe has to happen to wake people up to the reality of what's going on, because they're so complacent and lukewarm and living in a fantasy world, and believing we're going to get transported out of here before this all comes down.
[03:12:55.069 --> 03:13:01.253]  I don't see any other way, because most of them have this knee-jerk, deer-in-the-headlights, dare-reaction when I try to tell them what's going on.
[03:13:01.573 --> 03:13:04.855]  Well, sure, you tell the average fake Christian their daughter's on crack cocaine.
[03:13:05.215 --> 03:13:07.156]  They don't believe it until she dies of an overdose.
[03:13:07.576 --> 03:13:08.897]  I appreciate your fine points.
[03:13:09.477 --> 03:13:14.660]  Take the story of Pharaoh, Ramses, and Moses in the Bible.
[03:13:15.481 --> 03:13:19.043]  Whether you believe that's true or not, historically it shows it happened.
[03:13:19.063 --> 03:13:20.303]  I mean, at least those men existed.
[03:13:20.323 --> 03:13:21.484]  There was an exodus.
[03:13:23.405 --> 03:13:25.306]  But I went and saw the remake of it.
[03:13:25.326 --> 03:13:26.307]  I thought it was a pretty good film.
[03:13:27.776 --> 03:13:40.026]  With Bale, but I like the character of the guy that played Ramsey's, I forget his name, but it just gets worse and worse for him and he's getting judged and everything's, he gets beaten over and over again, but he's too prideful to stop.
[03:13:40.865 --> 03:13:42.526]  He's too prideful to turn back.
[03:13:43.086 --> 03:13:50.470]  And I've run into that with enemies who attack me and lie about me and come after me, even though bad stuff starts happening to them.
[03:13:50.490 --> 03:13:52.951]  And I don't want to get into mojo, mumbo-jumbo stuff here.
[03:13:52.971 --> 03:13:55.132]  I just know I've got providence.
[03:13:55.172 --> 03:14:02.556]  That's what humbles me so much, that anyone that's ever persecuted me, long-term, horrible things happen to them.
[03:14:03.837 --> 03:14:05.458]  And I've experienced providence.
[03:14:07.277 --> 03:14:09.359]  And things in my life that I won't even get into.
[03:14:09.399 --> 03:14:14.064]  But let me just say, there is a lot more in heaven and earth than is in all your books.
[03:14:14.544 --> 03:14:15.485]  Which Shakespeare is that?
[03:14:15.545 --> 03:14:16.226]  Is it Othello?
[03:14:19.049 --> 03:14:20.130]  Just type in Shakespeare.
[03:14:20.230 --> 03:14:23.554]  There is more in heaven and earth than in all your books.
[03:14:23.674 --> 03:14:24.314]  Horatio?
[03:14:24.374 --> 03:14:25.375]  I forget who he's talking to.
[03:14:26.377 --> 03:14:31.478]  I'm going from memory here, but it's not just evil that has power in this world.
[03:14:31.759 --> 03:14:33.779]  But evil knows the promise of the devil.
[03:14:34.259 --> 03:14:37.340]  It knows it can be given power, and they crave it.
[03:14:37.480 --> 03:14:38.880]  And good people do not crave it.
[03:14:40.861 --> 03:14:46.022]  You have to start craving, though, standing up against these people and get past your initial fear.
[03:14:47.943 --> 03:14:48.483]  It's Hamlet.
[03:14:48.523 --> 03:14:49.343]  That's right, it's Hamlet.
[03:14:49.663 --> 03:14:51.384]  I don't know why I didn't remember that.
[03:14:55.370 --> 03:14:56.271]  Where's the actual quote?
[03:14:59.273 --> 03:15:05.798]  There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, okay, so I was right, I just got the play wrong, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
[03:15:08.460 --> 03:15:13.945]  Then I guess in Master and Commander by O'Brien, they change it to in all your books.
[03:15:15.706 --> 03:15:17.828]  Hamlet 1-5-1-6-7-8.
[03:15:21.751 --> 03:15:23.152]  Let's go ahead and go to Ed in New York.
[03:15:23.252 --> 03:15:24.053]  Ed, thanks for calling.
[03:15:24.073 --> 03:15:24.373]  Go ahead.
[03:15:27.329 --> 03:15:27.649]  Hello?
[03:15:27.789 --> 03:15:28.230]  Yes, sir.
[03:15:29.531 --> 03:15:35.836]  Alright, I'm calling from FEMA Region 2, the easternmost point, and I want to talk about the Ronkonkoma Hub.
[03:15:35.916 --> 03:15:40.780]  It's, according to Chuck Schumer, the greatest development project in the nation right now.
[03:15:41.640 --> 03:15:42.481]  Give us your take on it.
[03:15:43.862 --> 03:15:45.263]  Well, this is what is happening.
[03:15:45.343 --> 03:15:48.125]  I live in Ronkonkoma.
[03:15:48.786 --> 03:15:51.148]  The town across from us, called Brookhaven,
[03:15:52.563 --> 03:16:08.037]  Past this plan, it's being backed by the Olain, uh, Saudi Arabian Olain Group, through the Tritec Corporation, and they're raising houses and businesses to expand the, uh, the Rockholm train station.
[03:16:08.057 --> 03:16:11.100]  They want to make MacArthur Airport an international airport.
[03:16:12.241 --> 03:16:15.764]  And they've, uh, and they've been threatening to use eminent domain
[03:16:16.437 --> 03:16:19.079]  We managed to stop them in January of 2014.
[03:16:19.659 --> 03:16:22.160]  I went knocking door-to-door and so did a few other people.
[03:16:22.200 --> 03:16:30.245]  We got 1,200 people down there to the town hall, but... Remember what happened in New York and Connecticut when they were taking stuff for Eli Lilly's plant?
[03:16:30.645 --> 03:16:33.526]  And they were taking, like, really nice houses and not even paying people for them?
[03:16:33.707 --> 03:16:35.988]  Because, see, that's the new eminent domain where they just don't pay you.
[03:16:37.170 --> 03:16:40.792]  Right, and you know, the top of it all, this is going to a private corporation.
[03:16:41.313 --> 03:16:58.383]  We have over $5 million in subsidies being announced and now we have, Schumer is now looking for the federal help and resources as well to really tear down our community and put up a lot of Section 8 housing all over the place.
[03:16:59.235 --> 03:17:05.359]  They're calling us a blight and a detriment to the community, but they're going to replace it with something that's, no, far more undesirable.
[03:17:05.379 --> 03:17:07.680]  Well sure, that's like Gore Seafood 15 years ago.
[03:17:07.700 --> 03:17:16.585]  We had their CEO and they've been around for like 60-something years and down the Texas coast the town just wanted to take their property and put a boat dock on and, you know, just said, we're not going to pay you either.
[03:17:16.685 --> 03:17:17.526]  I mean, that's the new thing is...
[03:17:18.925 --> 03:17:21.508]  You take 10 cents on the dollar or we won't pay you.
[03:17:21.988 --> 03:17:27.393]  Remember the Connecticut cases across from New York a few years ago when they didn't even give them money for their houses?
[03:17:27.754 --> 03:17:30.056]  And then if you sued, they would then charge you attorney's fees?
[03:17:31.357 --> 03:17:37.464]  Yeah, and you have to also put up, not a security, but you have to put up a large
[03:17:41.141 --> 03:17:45.003]  Sure, so in the old days, they had to pay you fair market value.
[03:17:45.063 --> 03:17:46.204]  Now, they just don't give anything.
[03:17:46.584 --> 03:17:51.487]  We've got a ranch and we've got a letter under a taxpayer bill of rights, or landowner bill of rights in Texas.
[03:17:52.667 --> 03:18:01.172]  The legislature passed it that said, yeah, if we want to put a pipeline across your property or do something, you have to accept what we offer or you get nothing afterwards or we'll charge you.
[03:18:01.492 --> 03:18:03.473]  And that's your property bill of rights.
[03:18:04.369 --> 03:18:05.489]  I appreciate your call, Ed.
[03:18:05.529 --> 03:18:06.550]  Sorry to hear that's happening.
[03:18:06.590 --> 03:18:07.610]  It's all part of the corruption.
[03:18:07.970 --> 03:18:08.791]  Randy, last call.
[03:18:08.811 --> 03:18:09.771]  We've only got about two minutes.
[03:18:09.791 --> 03:18:10.111]  Go ahead.
[03:18:10.131 --> 03:18:11.992]  Hey, yes, sir.
[03:18:13.332 --> 03:18:17.373]  Yeah, I was going to talk about these, all these Bilderbergers running for president.
[03:18:17.393 --> 03:18:27.317]  I think Dr. Ben Carson, he would be, I think, a good candidate, but I don't know that much about him yet.
[03:18:27.917 --> 03:18:30.358]  But y'all were touching on religion earlier.
[03:18:31.047 --> 03:18:36.369]  I've been watching Jack Van Eneby and Hal Lindsey on TV.
[03:18:36.689 --> 03:18:38.250]  And Rex Sullivan, MP.
[03:18:39.711 --> 03:18:49.215]  Yeah, and I watch these people and Van Eneby, he's the only one that talks about the New World Order.
[03:18:50.135 --> 03:18:51.356]  And Hal Lindsey does too.
[03:18:52.156 --> 03:18:53.097]  No, I know.
[03:18:53.517 --> 03:18:54.397]  I've had Hal Lindsey on.
[03:18:54.417 --> 03:18:56.738]  Let's get Hal Lindsey and Jack Van Eneby on the show.
[03:18:58.459 --> 03:18:58.679]  Yeah.
[03:19:00.222 --> 03:19:01.583]  Uh, oh, congratulations!
[03:19:01.643 --> 03:19:04.185]  I see you got a billboard in Shreveport, Louisiana.
[03:19:04.465 --> 03:19:10.349]  Well, I want to congratulate the fact that a bunch of people started copying one fellow who did it, and so it's a chain reaction.
[03:19:10.369 --> 03:19:14.331]  I'm getting calls daily from the East Coast, West Coast, and across the country.
[03:19:14.351 --> 03:19:15.952]  I want to salute everybody out there.
[03:19:15.992 --> 03:19:16.872]  It's having a big effect.
[03:19:17.913 --> 03:19:18.133]  Yeah.
[03:19:18.794 --> 03:19:25.157]  Uh, I want to say I helped plant seeds in that area, but, uh, I can't be for sure.
[03:19:25.338 --> 03:19:29.060]  Brother, you did everything before God and you did plant seeds and that's what matters.
[03:19:30.146 --> 03:19:33.835]  And it's right behind the Independence Stadium on the interstate.
[03:19:33.996 --> 03:19:36.321]  Man, it's a good location for that billboard.
[03:19:36.963 --> 03:19:38.046]  And whoever did it...
[03:19:38.672 --> 03:19:42.973]  You know, I've been trying to find out who did that, you know, because I like to contribute to that and keep it up there.
[03:19:43.473 --> 03:19:47.514]  We need to get that fellow that did it back on and folks can contribute right to him.
[03:19:47.554 --> 03:19:48.334]  He's doing a great job.
[03:19:49.074 --> 03:19:52.195]  Set up that fellow that was on the Nightly News that put up like 50 of them around the country.
[03:19:52.615 --> 03:19:54.395]  But I mean, there's a bunch of people doing it now.
[03:19:54.495 --> 03:19:56.036]  It's really exciting the power of the people.
[03:19:56.336 --> 03:19:57.436]  Randy, sorry I'm out of time.
[03:19:57.756 --> 03:19:59.476]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[03:19:59.956 --> 03:20:02.057]  And don't forget, I'll be back Sunday, Lord willing.
[03:20:02.477 --> 03:20:04.477]  Don't count my chickens before they're hatched.
[03:20:04.497 --> 03:20:05.257]  4 to 6 p.m.
[03:20:05.297 --> 03:20:05.838]  Central time.
[03:20:05.878 --> 03:20:06.718]  Great job to the crew.
[03:20:07.158 --> 03:20:07.658]  Love y'all.
[03:20:09.793 --> 03:20:11.535]  What good is a big, berky water?
[03:20:11.575 --> 03:20:11.775]  Concurring.
[03:20:12.076 --> 03:20:15.460]  Worried about getting sick and feeling terrible for days or even weeks?
[03:20:15.760 --> 03:20:18.023]  You need Imudine for a healthy immune system.
