[00:00:03.723 --> 00:00:06.545]  So it's a totally unfair and unbalanced fight.
[00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:17.732]  And now the rebels, the freedom fighters, the Syrian National Army, are being beaten every place around Syria.
[00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:21.054]  So we've got to change the battlefield situation.
[00:00:21.494 --> 00:00:27.678]  And just sending arms, very frankly, although they need them very badly, they need anti-tank and anti-air weapons,
[00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.584]  Is not going to change the situation on the ground and the massacre goes on.
[00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:52.646]  According to volunteer forces who are fighting the terrorists, American helicopters drop boxes of weapons in Yathrib and Balad districts in the Salahuddin province.
[00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:59.232]  The airdrop comes as the Iraqi army and volunteers are making significant gains against the terrorist group there.
[00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:00.613]  Now, back in October, the U.S.
[00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:07.940]  military admitted that a bundle of ammunition and weapons it had dropped over the Syrian border town of Kobani had ended up in the hands of ISIL members.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:15.304]  Now it has been confirmed that ISIS has stockpiled enough radioactive material to create weapons of mass destruction.
[00:01:15.705 --> 00:01:29.673]  In the ISIS magazine Dabiq, ISIS declared their intent to acquire a nuclear warhead from Pakistan with their billions of stolen funds, gobbled up as they ransacked banks and took control of oil fields across Iraq and Syria.
[00:01:29.953 --> 00:01:39.577]  ISIS claims that all they have to do is call on their leaders in Pakistan to purchase a nuclear device through weapons dealers with links to corrupt officials in the region.
[00:01:39.757 --> 00:01:44.719]  India's Defense Minister Rao Inderjit Singh made the remark, Bloomberg quoted him as saying.
[00:01:54.503 --> 00:02:09.922]  ISIS admits that the scenario is a bit exaggerated, but then points out that a few thousand tons of ammonium nitrate explosive used in mining operations, or the weaponization of toxic chlorine as the gas berthelite, would be easy enough to make.
[00:02:10.282 --> 00:02:30.496]  And it's designed to target mainly an American audience that is not geopolitically informed and doesn't know what's been happening for over two and a half years in Syria where NATO and the United States, that includes France, England, you name it, have injected over a hundred thousand foreign fighters from Saudi Arabia, from
[00:02:31.457 --> 00:02:32.238]  We're good to go.
[00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:07.753]  There is a reason why President Obama has taken such a priority to stop the proliferation of these weapons.
[00:03:07.773 --> 00:03:15.896]  There is a reason why President Obama has dropped clear to the Assad regime that this international norm cannot be tolerated without the consequences.
[00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:39.042]  Why no matter what you believe about Syria... No matter what you believe... All peoples and all nations... All people who believe in the cause of our common humanity... Our humanity should support them injecting Al-Qaeda rebels to try to overthrow the government and kill all the Christians.
[00:03:39.663 --> 00:03:41.203]  ISIS is about 30,000.
[00:03:41.443 --> 00:03:43.663]  Irregulars.
[00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:45.524]  They're not technically trained.
[00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:47.482]  Uh, to fight.
[00:03:47.522 --> 00:03:53.486]  They have only the heavy equipment that they capture from, uh, from us.
[00:03:53.906 --> 00:04:05.355]  Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says NATO is deeply concerned about radioactive materials ISIS has seized from research centers and hospitals that are exclusive to government stockpiles.
[00:04:05.735 --> 00:04:19.028]  ISIS has already been pushing its way into Saudi Arabia, Yemen and other parts of the Middle East, becoming as UK Home Secretary Theresa May declared, just months away from becoming the world's first truly terrorist state.
[00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:24.914]  ISIS has essentially reached this plateau of potential mass devastation in roughly one year.
[00:04:25.194 --> 00:04:34.859]  They will not rest until their perfect storm of globalized militant groups have unleashed its full scope of US-backed intelligence and funding on the American public.
[00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:38.821]  Of course, whether they have weapons or not is beside the point.
[00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:51.327]  ISIS is already very successful at engaging the media in a giant psy-op to terrorize the public and keep a firm grip on American freedoms as deemed necessary by the elite corporatic succubus
[00:04:51.647 --> 00:04:57.198]  As they prepare the final phases of construction of the superstructure of a New World Order.
[00:04:57.498 --> 00:04:59.542]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:05:06.636 --> 00:05:10.020]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself.
[00:05:10.441 --> 00:05:13.805]  Our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:05:13.905 --> 00:05:16.087]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:05:16.267 --> 00:05:21.454]  Indoor air has been shown to have 2 to 5 times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:05:21.634 --> 00:05:26.720]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.961]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:05:30.241 --> 00:05:34.163]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:05:34.363 --> 00:05:38.684]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:05:38.764 --> 00:05:48.868]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
