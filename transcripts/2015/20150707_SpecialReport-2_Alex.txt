[00:00:09.082 --> 00:00:11.224]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:18.209]  Now this week the Pope decided to go full retard when he released a statement saying the gun manufacturers are not Christians.
[00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:29.618]  Well I find that extremely funny to hear that coming from the Pope because here at InfoWars.com we do have a Christian owned gun manufacturer as a sponsor, Head Down Rifles.
[00:00:30.398 --> 00:00:36.503]  Now their CEO and co-founder David Hunsucker released a statement where he was just completely in shock
[00:00:37.518 --> 00:00:40.700]  By the fact that the Pope would release such a statement.
[00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:44.863]  Going after manufacturers of guns.
[00:00:44.923 --> 00:00:46.444]  This is a Christian owned company.
[00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:54.669]  These guys provide a service for families who do not have the money to go to these expensive grocery stores and buy food.
[00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.674]  Head Down Rifles allows families to go out, hunt, put food on the table for their families.
[00:01:02.134 --> 00:01:02.835]  We're good.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.902]  You have to take it upon yourself to go out and protect yourself and your family.
[00:01:23.423 --> 00:01:28.405]  Now, there is a verse in the Bible, Luke 22 verse 36.
[00:01:30.106 --> 00:01:35.228]  Jesus says to them, but now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag.
[00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:39.490]  And if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.
[00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.810]  Now what does that mean?
[00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.712]  If you're going to be walking around out there, you need to be able to protect yourself.
[00:01:45.592 --> 00:01:46.833]  This is in the Bible.
[00:01:47.927 --> 00:01:49.728]  But the Pope doesn't want you to have that.
[00:01:49.768 --> 00:01:54.891]  He's jumping on board with Obama, with Feinstein, with Holder.
[00:01:55.871 --> 00:01:59.313]  What happens in areas where they go and grab your guns?
[00:02:00.574 --> 00:02:07.818]  Look what happened in France with the Charlie Hebdo attacks when ISIS was able to just move freely about and shoot things up, kill people.
[00:02:08.338 --> 00:02:11.260]  Look what happens when ISIS comes to Texas, here in the U.S.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.881]  They get shot down.
[00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:13.301]  Why?
[00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:16.243]  Because we are able to protect ourselves.
[00:02:17.096 --> 00:02:20.759]  We live in a world where bad people do bad things.
[00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:26.023]  And you have to sometimes take it upon yourself to protect yourself.
[00:02:27.043 --> 00:02:32.747]  There's not always going to be this divine power that's going to jump down and stop a bullet coming at you.
[00:02:32.787 --> 00:02:38.051]  You need to be able to pick up a gun and be able to protect yourself and those around you.
[00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:39.792]  And that's what it's all about.
[00:02:40.153 --> 00:02:44.396]  It's funny how the people who want to take your gun to the ones who are most surrounded by them.
[00:02:45.472 --> 00:02:54.940]  The President doesn't want us to be able to have our guns, and yet he is completely protected by tons of people with firepower.
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.263]  Feinstein, completely protected by people with guns.
[00:03:00.064 --> 00:03:02.986]  Eric Holder, completely protected by people with guns.
[00:03:04.107 --> 00:03:11.433]  When you look back in history at all these nations where the weapons were taken away from the populace, what has happened?
[00:03:11.753 --> 00:03:12.914]  Complete and total tyranny.
[00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.130]  There's a lot of things that we have to do in this world, in this country, to make some positive changes.
[00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.451]  But one thing that shouldn't change is the right to bear arms.
[00:03:23.132 --> 00:03:25.092]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:03:36.876 --> 00:03:41.597]  There's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now.
[00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:47.201]  And if you're wondering how on earth we ever got in this situation, well I'll tell you how.
[00:03:47.721 --> 00:03:53.228]  When the Democrats showed their true colors, you got angry and you elected Republicans.
[00:03:53.748 --> 00:03:58.995]  And then when the Republicans showed their true colors, you got angry and elected Democrats.
[00:03:59.415 --> 00:04:09.501]  And when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt and that neither side were looking out for your best interest, you acted like they were crazy.
[00:04:10.081 --> 00:04:17.786]  But the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
[00:04:18.286 --> 00:04:24.193]  That's why it is vitally important that you wake up, America, and break the matrix.
[00:04:24.553 --> 00:04:29.498]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:32.342]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
