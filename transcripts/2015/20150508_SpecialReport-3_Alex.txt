[00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:12.428]  Much research points to the widespread existence of unconscious bias.
[00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.730]  But then there are the unconscious biases.
[00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.091]  Unconscious bias.
[00:00:16.331 --> 00:00:18.393]  Implicit racial bias.
[00:00:19.053 --> 00:00:22.997]  There's a new trend, a new term, unconscious bias.
[00:00:23.317 --> 00:00:25.358]  Or as it's sometimes called, implicit bias.
[00:00:25.799 --> 00:00:30.963]  That surprise and the behaviors associated with it are the product of something called unconscious bias.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:42.263]  Everyone from government workers to private employees are all being compelled to take a good look at their unconscious minds and the hidden biases that lurk beneath.
[00:00:43.144 --> 00:00:50.866]  Experts claim that biases prevent employees from being productive and creative, while it hinders government employees' ability to make sound decisions.
[00:00:51.466 --> 00:01:00.709]  If the idea of the establishment evaluating your most hidden thoughts and emotions to determine if you're politically correct enough to function, that doesn't sit well with you, you're not alone.
[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.628]  It's easy to dismiss the importance of the subject of the unconscious mind as simply a concept used by psychiatrists to better understand their patients.
[00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:18.637]  But we live in a world where you can't turn your head without being bombarded by some advertiser's attempt to influence our unconscious minds and behaviors.
[00:01:19.198 --> 00:01:41.159]  On top of the excessive attempts to manipulate our behavior through subliminal suggestions in the media, the psychiatric profession also serves the establishment as a convenient way to sidestep our entire judicial system with tools like the Hare Psychopath Checklist Revise, a PCLR, that they can use to directly incarcerate whoever they label as institutional.
[00:01:42.284 --> 00:01:46.287]  Criminal profiling has been a popular establishment tool since World War II.
[00:01:46.647 --> 00:02:01.116]  According to historian Gary Lachman, who stated in his 2010 book Jung the Mystic, it was Carl Jung himself who in 1942 met with the one and only Alan Dulles and began a, quote, experimental marriage between espionage and psychology, unquote.
[00:02:01.576 --> 00:02:05.359]  ...involving the psychological profile of political and military leaders.
[00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:14.467]  Shortly after, psychoanalyst Walter C. Langer submitted to the OSS, the predecessor to the CIA, a report that probed the psychology of Adolf Hitler.
[00:02:14.747 --> 00:02:20.491]  Thus, the institution of psychological profiling was born, and it has grown into an uncontrollable beast.
[00:02:21.428 --> 00:02:36.775]  We've all heard the controversy over the TSA profiling suspected terrorists or threats and how absolutely absurd it is to believe that the TSA can actually be trained to detect a person's inner agenda just by glancing at them in a busy airport terminal for about five seconds.
[00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:43.258]  Which brings us to the latest trend in psychological tyranny, the unconscious bias examination.
[00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.380]  The term was virtually unknown on the web just a few months ago.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.042]  Now there are literally hundreds of articles on the subject.
[00:02:50.905 --> 00:02:58.654]  The articles are mostly pressuring large corporations to begin subjecting their employees to this degrading, unproven, intrusive requirement.
[00:02:59.215 --> 00:03:04.300]  And of course the government is already forcing its own workers to evaluate their own unconscious minds.
[00:03:05.276 --> 00:03:13.003]  On March 19, 2015, the Washington Times published an article titled, Federal Workers Ordered to Probe Their Unconscious Bias.
[00:03:13.383 --> 00:03:14.504]  They say, a top U.S.
[00:03:14.584 --> 00:03:27.256]  Forest Service executive told his employees to probe their own unconscious bias on everything from race and sexuality to the disabled and fat people, asking them to use an unproven assessment tool to explore their feelings.
[00:03:27.836 --> 00:03:39.230]  The online test, which the Forest Management Director urged other agency directors to use as well, specifically warns of problems when it's taken outside of the safeguards of a research institution.
[00:03:39.771 --> 00:03:43.996]  Users are also told to be careful about how far to go in interpreting the results.
[00:03:44.966 --> 00:03:58.113]  In an AP article on March 9th of this year, titled Police Agencies Line Up to Learn About Unconscious Bias, we find that police from all over the country are now being flown to LA to a place called the Museum of Tolerance.
[00:03:58.533 --> 00:04:07.638]  There they can learn how to evaluate and control their unconscious bias before making any potentially biased, therefore bad or perhaps fatal decisions.
[00:04:08.118 --> 00:04:24.515]  The head of the Justice Department program that offers this training to police departments says without even a hint of irony in talking about the unconscious bias of the police, this is one tool that police leaders are using to help really ensure their agencies engage in conscious policing.
[00:04:24.835 --> 00:04:30.681]  According to the head of the Justice Department's Community Oriented Policing Services program, the one offering the training,
[00:04:31.662 --> 00:04:38.908]  Nobody can argue that conscious policing is a good thing, and in the midst of a tense situation, a conscious clear head is a requirement.
[00:04:39.628 --> 00:04:41.589]  But that's not what they're talking about.
[00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.354]  Some researchers caution that there's not enough evidence to show that implicit bias training is effective.
[00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:59.463]  As others have pointed out, this could potentially endanger officers by making them slower to recognize threats for fear of being called biased, or it could endanger the public by making them shoot even quicker.
[00:05:00.307 --> 00:05:08.350]  And they point out the training's benefits could quickly disappear when an officer gets back into the real world, or it could even increase racial bias in the long term.
[00:05:09.971 --> 00:05:17.815]  FBI Director James Comey said recently that rifts between police and communities can't be fully bridged until we acknowledge unconscious bias.
[00:05:19.255 --> 00:05:23.357]  Much research points to the widespread existence of unconscious bias.
[00:05:23.617 --> 00:05:25.598]  If we can't help our latent biases,
[00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:31.093]  We can help our behavior in response to those instinctive reactions.
[00:05:31.773 --> 00:05:35.056]  What about holding police accountable for their actions?
[00:05:35.957 --> 00:05:43.844]  Wouldn't that be a better start than an abstract examination into a police officer's mind that might impair his reaction time, putting him in grave danger?
[00:05:45.213 --> 00:05:58.561]  There's also a huge push for the private sector to utilize this technique for increased creativity and productivity, and not surprisingly, to root out any potential gender issues that are floating around just below the surface.
[00:05:59.602 --> 00:06:07.327]  Administering an exam based on unproven techniques that can affect a person's employment status sounds like a recipe for disaster.
[00:06:07.887 --> 00:06:15.429]  Let's not forget about the other possible consequences of introducing a compulsory system and probing a person's unconscious mind in an inappropriate setting.
[00:06:15.829 --> 00:06:17.350]  In this case, the workplace.
[00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:26.052]  Forcing people to examine their minds in this way, when they're not prepared in this kind of a setting, can involuntarily surface repressed emotions, memories, trauma.
[00:06:26.373 --> 00:06:34.415]  Without the aid of a trained professional to help deal correctly with these lost feelings, a person can experience what is known as re-traumatization.
[00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:39.278]  And cause a person to go into deep depression, nervous breakdown, or even suicide.
[00:06:39.778 --> 00:06:45.261]  And finally, this kind of testing at work opens the possibilities for singling people out.
[00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:55.367]  If the police training facility called the Museum of Tolerance doesn't raise the Orwellian eyebrow, just think about the fact that the unthought is still a thought crime.
[00:06:56.067 --> 00:07:06.098]  Someone can be labeled, stigmatized, have their life ruined, all based on a test that, without proof, alleges to detect hidden thoughts, feelings, and motivations.
[00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:14.908]  Just a few months back, then Attorney General Eric Holder used unconscious bias to describe racial bias present in the Ferguson police force.
[00:07:15.336 --> 00:07:27.811]  Our review of the evidence found no, no alternative explanation for the disproportionate impact on African American residents other than implicit and explicit racial bias.
[00:07:28.621 --> 00:07:34.325]  It's clear that the establishment has been toying with this new tool for a little while, and they're rolling it out now.
[00:07:34.846 --> 00:07:49.956]  Considering how abusive the government is with other methods provided to them by the psychiatric profession, imagine how much more abusive it will get when everywhere you go, you will not only be judged for your actions and thoughts, but also judged for thoughts that others claim you have the potential for having.
[00:07:50.737 --> 00:08:04.228]  It would be a mistake not to observe how the media is bombarding us with headlines associating the term unconscious bias mostly with gender bias, just as Hillary Clinton begins her campaign using gender bias as her campaign crutch.
[00:08:04.848 --> 00:08:13.155]  Remember, Hillary is proposing government fun camps for adults to go to and be re-educated into a functional member of society.
[00:08:13.596 --> 00:08:16.338]  The type without any unauthorized biases.
[00:08:17.186 --> 00:08:21.070]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[00:08:21.791 --> 00:08:29.359]  The unconscious bias exam might just be the perfect tool for singling out anyone they want and dragging them away into a government camp.
[00:08:31.004 --> 00:08:40.686]  So even though we could incarcerate the wrong person, we could destroy due process, we could have an all-out Orwellian tyranny, many experts say there could be something positive in this for society.
[00:08:40.926 --> 00:08:43.046]  Well, I've got an idea of what we could do that would be positive.
[00:08:43.206 --> 00:08:48.347]  How about we use it to screen potential leaders to see if they're psychologically sound.
[00:08:48.688 --> 00:08:50.808]  After all, we don't want our president to be a psychopath.
[00:08:51.148 --> 00:08:53.368]  We could even call it the Dr. Strangelove test.
[00:08:53.909 --> 00:08:55.909]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[00:09:06.266 --> 00:09:07.206]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:09:07.286 --> 00:09:09.947]  Most of you know me as a syndicated radio host and documentary filmmaker.
[00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:15.208]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I was only 21 years old.
[00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:25.031]  And if you go back 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds, I jogged 6 miles every other day, I lifted weights 5 days a week, I could swim 2-3 miles.
[00:09:25.771 --> 00:09:28.652]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[00:09:29.632 --> 00:09:31.193]  I started an access television show.
[00:09:31.634 --> 00:09:35.016]  Shortly after that, I was able to get a local radio show.
[00:09:35.496 --> 00:09:40.320]  I was so dedicated to my work, and hanging around with radio guys, that I began drinking.
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.782]  I began smoking cigars, and then even cigarettes.
[00:09:44.223 --> 00:09:49.927]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee, to looking like a Jabba the Hutt.
[00:09:51.141 --> 00:09:58.367]  It was my friend Tommy Pallotta, a film producer, he said, Alex, you're killing yourself not caring about your body.
[00:09:58.667 --> 00:10:00.609]  You're going to end up having a heart attack when you're 50 years old.
[00:10:00.909 --> 00:10:01.650]  You got to stop.
[00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:06.975]  And so I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[00:10:07.375 --> 00:10:09.797]  The first three years I lost about 25 pounds.
[00:10:10.257 --> 00:10:11.258]  It was super hard.
[00:10:11.619 --> 00:10:16.523]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[00:10:16.843 --> 00:10:24.189]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Group for Infowarslife.com, the results were incredible.
[00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:30.595]  The problem was, though, I'd never been a vitamin and mineral and supplement taker before, so I kept forgetting to do it.
[00:10:30.915 --> 00:10:35.299]  Just a month and a half ago, I asked the crew to take a photo of me in the same lighting
[00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:45.966]  To see what I could do in just a month and a half by taking the Oxy Powder, by taking the Survival Shield X2, and the other InfoWarsLife.com products, to see if it accelerated it.
[00:10:46.426 --> 00:10:46.986]  And it did.
[00:10:47.387 --> 00:10:49.768]  This is what happened in just 45 days.
[00:10:49.808 --> 00:11:02.757]  We took this photo back there in the back office, and I'd already lost a lot of weight, but I lost another 6 pounds with the Oxy Powder and the other products at InfoWarsLife.com, and this photo was just taken a few days ago.
[00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:06.092]  And it wasn't just the acceleration of weight loss.
[00:11:06.393 --> 00:11:11.136]  My muscle mass increased along with my stamina and overall energy and libido.

[00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.851]  I'm getting back to where I was 20 years ago.
