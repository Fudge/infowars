[00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:14.389]  Before the blood even dried in today's Paris shooting, the politically correct police came out to say that those at the Charlie Hebdo magazine should have known better.
[00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:30.402]  A Financial Times column basically said that Hebdo was wearing too short of a skirt when they said, this is not the slightest to condone the murderers who must be caught and punished, or to suggest that freedom of expression should not extend to satirical portrayals of religion.
[00:00:30.942 --> 00:00:34.863]  It is merely to say that some common sense would be useful.
[00:00:35.423 --> 00:00:42.045]  The AP, Guardian UK and others also pointed out what Ebdo had done to provoke these acts.
[00:00:42.526 --> 00:00:50.108]  There were similar reactions when the Ebdo headquarters were bombed in 2011 after the magazine ran cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.
[00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:56.610]  Time condemned the magazine, saying the antics openly beg for violent responses from extremists.
[00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.274]  So apparently this is what we do now, give in to fear rather than uphold our freedoms.
[00:01:02.654 --> 00:01:07.919]  We saw this recently when Sony pulled the interview after alleged threats by North Korea.
[00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.564]  So did those involved with the making of the interview deserve to be nuked for making fun of Kim Jong-un?
[00:01:15.024 --> 00:01:26.574]  And will magazines and newspapers repost these offensive cartoons as their patriotic duty, much like people were calling to watch the interview as a patriotic act?
[00:01:27.034 --> 00:01:32.821]  Christians didn't shoot up Hollywood for their recent portrayals of God, Noah, Moses and others.
[00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:39.909]  And far from targeting Muslims in particular, Charlie Hebdo has ridiculed everyone from British people to the Pope.
[00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:47.578]  Yeah, those cartoons might be in bad taste, but truly free speech protects the rights of those with bad taste.
[00:01:48.098 --> 00:01:52.820]  If a satirical magazine is not poking fun, it's not doing its job.
[00:01:53.281 --> 00:02:01.565]  ISIS can post videos and pictures of beheadings on Twitter, yet we're supposed to be silent about their 7th century barbarism.
[00:02:02.065 --> 00:02:13.371]  Among the 10 journalists killed Wednesday was Charlie Hebdo editor StÃ©phane Charbonneur, who told Le Monde newspaper two years ago, I'd rather die standing than live on my knees.
[00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:19.857]  Now is not the time to start policing our thoughts based on the whims of the perpetually offended.
[00:02:20.337 --> 00:02:22.239]  That is not free speech.
[00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.564]  Not only do we not negotiate with terrorists, our rights are never negotiable.
