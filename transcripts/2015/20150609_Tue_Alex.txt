[00:00:01.542 --> 00:00:04.286]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:14.402 --> 00:00:14.843]  Gear up!
[00:00:16.277 --> 00:00:20.439]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.920]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:23.601]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:27.863]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.424 --> 00:00:32.486]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:46.330]  Federal Austrian police two hours ago visited the Hotel Lodge where InfoWars reporters Rob Dew and Josh Owens are staying.
[00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:54.598]  They were in another town interviewing locals about their view of the secretive criminal organization.
[00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:55.980]  Many of their members have been indicted.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.041]  Meeting.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.862]  in their area of the Austrian Alps.
[00:01:01.623 --> 00:01:10.251]  The hotel owner called and said the police are upset about your YouTube videos and they want to talk to you and want to see your papers.
[00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:12.733]  You cannot make this up.
[00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:23.162]  We have amazing video coming up and audio that we're going to air here for the TV slash radio audience of another checkpoint
[00:01:24.523 --> 00:01:27.264]  And the federal police saying, what are you doing filming us?
[00:01:27.304 --> 00:01:28.224]  It's not very polite.
[00:01:29.624 --> 00:01:32.105]  As they're sitting there filming them, obviously, at a checkpoint.
[00:01:32.785 --> 00:01:38.567]  Big mobile checkpoints set up on the side of the road with big open back trucks, I guess, to load people into.
[00:01:40.908 --> 00:01:47.729]  And he goes on to say, the quote, police officer, I do this for the taxpayers.
[00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:49.390]  The taxpayers' money pays me to do this.
[00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:50.950]  There is a private party.
[00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.851]  I will protect it from threats.
[00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:56.681]  And obviously they don't like that video.
[00:01:59.003 --> 00:02:00.084]  Unprecedented.
[00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:07.171]  So now the feds are looking and boy, you talk about bugging their eyes out hatefully.
[00:02:07.851 --> 00:02:09.653]  The video's up on Infowars.com.
[00:02:09.993 --> 00:02:12.496]  Bilderberg police defend tyrannical checkpoints.
[00:02:12.936 --> 00:02:16.279]  Reporter confronts Austrian police at security checkpoint.
[00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:20.223]  And Dew gets out and goes over and starts talking to them.
[00:02:22.338 --> 00:02:34.326]  Guaranteed, and I know they're watching live as well, guaranteed they're going to try to claim that Dew was secretly recording him or something when he clearly is there in a public place, no perception of privacy.
[00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:37.668]  I've checked Austrian laws, they're the same as ours under common law.
[00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:44.253]  But they always project that you're a criminal because they're protecting known, real criminals.
[00:02:44.713 --> 00:02:47.675]  Let me explain something to the Austrian police watching right now.
[00:02:51.693 --> 00:02:53.876]  This is what your masters don't want.
[00:02:54.296 --> 00:02:55.097]  London Guardian.
[00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:57.500]  The front of the London Guardian.
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.422]  Forget the G7 Summit.
[00:02:59.522 --> 00:03:02.626]  Bilderberg is where the big guns go.
[00:03:02.646 --> 00:03:03.647]  Do you see this?
[00:03:03.707 --> 00:03:05.289]  Do you hear this, Austrian feds?
[00:03:06.831 --> 00:03:07.732]  Forget the G7.
[00:03:07.772 --> 00:03:09.194]  Bilderberg is where the big guns go.
[00:03:09.574 --> 00:03:11.677]  And we're there like normal people.
[00:03:12.697 --> 00:03:16.719]  Reporting on the group that brags they created the Euro, the TPP, and all of it.
[00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:25.023]  Where they're like normal people that don't want to be conquered by a bunch of people that resemble Spectre from an Ian Fleming novel.
[00:03:26.063 --> 00:03:26.564]  We're normal.
[00:03:26.944 --> 00:03:37.509]  You can try to invert reality with myself who has no criminal record, my reporters who have no criminal record, and who have an upstanding history of breaking real, hardcore, global news.
[00:03:38.663 --> 00:03:44.404]  So go ahead and push it, and show everybody what tyrants you are, and it's going to blow up politically in your face.
[00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:50.286]  And we know, you know, you've got plenty of arrogance over there, and that's fine.
[00:03:51.446 --> 00:03:57.667]  But we're here defending ourselves and our sovereignty, and you should be wanting to defend your country's sovereignty from this usurpation.
[00:03:57.968 --> 00:04:00.348]  Because you've been conquered before by the Nazis.
[00:04:00.868 --> 00:04:03.849]  I don't believe the globalist conspiracy is a Nazi conspiracy.
[00:04:05.071 --> 00:04:11.515]  But the European Union, on record, was a project of Adolf Alois Hitler of Austria.
[00:04:14.097 --> 00:04:20.421]  That is a Nazi project, 1937, promoted the year before that at the Olympic Games, on record.
[00:04:21.582 --> 00:04:26.345]  And a Nazi helped establish it when it was set up, Prince Bernhard.
[00:04:27.306 --> 00:04:27.766]  And others.
[00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:33.470]  So, your country is being conquered again by the very same people that conquered your nation in 1939.
[00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:40.438]  1940.
[00:04:36.591 --> 00:04:40.438]  And you're here, acting like goons, trying to frustrate free speech.
[00:04:40.758 --> 00:04:41.981]  But the globalists have already failed.
[00:04:43.563 --> 00:04:44.245]  London Guardian.
[00:04:44.465 --> 00:04:45.768]  Forget the G7 Summit.
[00:04:46.008 --> 00:04:47.471]  Bilderberg is where the big guns go.
[00:04:49.685 --> 00:04:54.668]  Big business set to lobby politicians for the future of EU at Bilderberg Group meeting.
[00:04:55.088 --> 00:04:55.749]  London Independent.
[00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:58.610]  It's all over French, German, Dutch news.
[00:04:58.951 --> 00:05:05.835]  It's not in US news except for Infowars.com and DrugsReport.com is linking to that and breaking the blockade.
[00:05:06.195 --> 00:05:08.096]  We'll be back doing our job being journalists.
[00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:14.303]  Checkpoints, harassment, and Cobra Commandos.
[00:05:14.723 --> 00:05:17.627]  This is not your granddaddy's smoke-filled room.
[00:05:18.007 --> 00:05:20.329]  This is Bilderberg 2015.
[00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:29.199]  Every year, the Bilderberg Confab tweaks its efforts to lock out the media, deny transparency, and keep its agenda secret.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:45.406]  Similar to the 6.2-mile exclusion zone around the radioactive Chernobyl plant, Austrian Federal Police have set up a similar-sized zone to keep the public away from the hotel where over 150 world leaders will meet in secret.
[00:05:45.926 --> 00:05:55.070]  InfoWars reporters were stopped at a checkpoint, had their vehicle searched, and even had police come to the front door of their hotel room.
[00:05:55.771 --> 00:06:02.703]  All in the name of keeping their cameras away from the 150 world leaders attempting to meet in secret.
[00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:08.012]  We'll have continual coverage of Bilderberg on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:06:09.745 --> 00:06:12.167]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:12.368 --> 00:06:13.388]  Check it out today.
[00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:22.036]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none and that's what you'll find at Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:22.237 --> 00:06:29.323]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[00:06:29.383 --> 00:06:30.003]  We're good to go.
[00:06:45.675 --> 00:06:49.217]  Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shield, Oxy Powder.
[00:06:49.477 --> 00:06:59.941]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.
[00:07:00.281 --> 00:07:07.905]  Folks, check out Infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[00:07:09.727 --> 00:07:14.490]  Alex Jones here with an Infowarslife.com consumer alert report.
[00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:21.955]  Many of you are aware that around the world most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[00:07:22.235 --> 00:07:30.000]  The good news is our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.301]  The bad news is
[00:07:31.641 --> 00:07:38.923]  For the first time in more than a year, supplies at InfoWarsLife.com of Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine are running low.
[00:07:39.303 --> 00:07:43.725]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these Deep Earth Crystals.
[00:07:44.105 --> 00:07:51.287]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary and only available to InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:51.467 --> 00:07:54.368]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[00:07:54.588 --> 00:08:01.293]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[00:08:01.573 --> 00:08:05.576]  Available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:08:15.939 --> 00:08:21.480]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.641]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:08:36.724 --> 00:08:38.904]  It is Tuesday, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:41.945]  The ninth day of June, 2015.
[00:08:41.985 --> 00:08:43.325]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:47.386 --> 00:08:57.735]  If you go to InfoWars.com, there's an article by Kurt Nemo titled, Vilderberg Orders Cops to Harass Journalists, Voice Your Opposition.
[00:08:59.056 --> 00:09:05.141]  And Paul Watson in the UK about the travel to Austria is writing an update on this.
[00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:14.589]  The federal police came to the Lodge Hotel that InfoWars.com reporters Josh Owens and Rob Dew were staying at.
[00:09:16.069 --> 00:09:30.317]  They were down the mountain at Telth and were upset, the hotel owner said, and were looking for them because of their, quote, YouTube videos and wanted to see their passport and other, quote, papers.
[00:09:32.518 --> 00:09:33.758]  Papers, please!
[00:09:33.778 --> 00:09:34.699]  But they don't say please.
[00:09:35.499 --> 00:09:42.063]  Already at a checkpoint yesterday, they pull up and the police are bugging their eyes out murderously.
[00:09:43.064 --> 00:09:47.025]  Like Rob New and Josh Owens had just been caught with dead babies in the back of the car.
[00:09:48.646 --> 00:09:56.408]  All part of the pure intimidation of you don't come here, you don't cover the 150 flaming bad guys.
[00:09:56.848 --> 00:10:01.009]  Even mainstream news is now likening it to a Mafia 2.0.
[00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.991]  Is now likening it to a Spectre meeting.
[00:10:07.611 --> 00:10:08.791]  Guys covering their faces.
[00:10:09.251 --> 00:10:10.692]  Black helicopters landing.
[00:10:10.752 --> 00:10:11.992]  Private jets coming in.
[00:10:12.392 --> 00:10:13.452]  Armored limousines.
[00:10:14.052 --> 00:10:16.393]  And six and a half miles away.
[00:10:16.933 --> 00:10:18.433]  I was corrected by Rob Due last night.
[00:10:18.953 --> 00:10:20.554]  Six and a half miles away.
[00:10:22.674 --> 00:10:24.735]  They have the first checkpoints on the roads.
[00:10:24.775 --> 00:10:26.595]  Just roads going out of the town.
[00:10:26.675 --> 00:10:27.675]  Roads going other directions.
[00:10:28.055 --> 00:10:28.976]  Major roads.
[00:10:29.016 --> 00:10:29.616]  You pull up.
[00:10:29.916 --> 00:10:30.616]  We have video of this.
[00:10:30.636 --> 00:10:31.976]  We're about to play it if you're a radio listener.
[00:10:32.276 --> 00:10:33.377]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[00:10:33.397 --> 00:10:33.917]  You can see it.
[00:10:34.277 --> 00:10:35.277]  And PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:10:36.673 --> 00:10:44.235]  And you pull up and there's federal police with big trucks blocking the road with checkpoints set up searching your vehicles.
[00:10:47.316 --> 00:10:51.577]  If you have a private party and someone threatens it, we're going to protect it.
[00:10:51.737 --> 00:10:52.258]  No, you're not.
[00:10:55.219 --> 00:11:00.280]  These cops' eyes are shaking and bugging out of their heads crazily.
[00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:03.281]  And to Dew's credit,
[00:11:04.986 --> 00:11:08.908]  After the guy really smarts off and runs off, Duke gets out and goes over and starts talking to him.
[00:11:10.329 --> 00:11:14.971]  Because it's hard to have some guy bow up to you for no reason and not want to put them in their place.
[00:11:16.812 --> 00:11:19.453]  Here's the deal, we can't get a hold of our reporters right now.
[00:11:19.794 --> 00:11:23.015]  I talked to them 30 minutes ago, they were going to do a live feed.
[00:11:25.076 --> 00:11:29.879]  And I'm told we now have them on the phone, we're going to ascertain what's happening there.
[00:11:29.899 --> 00:11:32.300]  Yes, yes, we'll go phone if we can't do Skype.
[00:11:36.223 --> 00:11:38.184]  But the Globalists are losing right now.
[00:11:38.744 --> 00:11:40.064]  TPP is unraveling.
[00:11:40.124 --> 00:11:40.905]  It's in deep trouble.
[00:11:43.105 --> 00:11:44.266]  Sure, they'll try to pass it again.
[00:11:44.306 --> 00:11:45.006]  We'll fight it again.
[00:11:48.527 --> 00:11:51.068]  These are tectonic forces of good and evil throughout history, folks.
[00:11:51.268 --> 00:11:53.849]  People think, we beat it nine times, but they're back again.
[00:11:53.869 --> 00:11:55.650]  They're gonna win.
[00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:56.010]  No!
[00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:57.910]  We have to want it more than they do.
[00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.771]  It's like a four-quarter football game here.
[00:12:00.031 --> 00:12:01.792]  And by the way, we're in the fourth quarter tied.
[00:12:02.918 --> 00:12:04.499]  Fourth quarter's startin', baby.
[00:12:05.119 --> 00:12:07.421]  And for it's all the marbles, everything.
[00:12:11.603 --> 00:12:15.045]  Forget the G7 Summit, Bilderberg is where the big guns go.
[00:12:15.545 --> 00:12:16.346]  London Guardian.
[00:12:19.127 --> 00:12:24.270]  London Independent, big business set to lobby politicians on the future of the EU at Bilderberg Group meeting.
[00:12:24.511 --> 00:12:26.532]  They go on to basically say it's illegal.
[00:12:28.664 --> 00:12:37.150]  All over, the Spanish, and the Dutch, and the Greek, and the Italian, and the Austrian, and the UK, they're reporting on Bilderberg saying it's criminal.
[00:12:40.993 --> 00:12:52.061]  Here in the US, zero coverage but InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and other quote alternative media that's bigger than most mainstream media set side by side against each outlet.
[00:12:54.062 --> 00:12:56.523]  And DrugsReport.com helping get it out, linking to our stories.
[00:12:56.883 --> 00:13:02.887]  That's the only groups covering this because mainline conservatives got up for years and said this didn't exist.
[00:13:03.487 --> 00:13:13.672]  Because if you ever admit they're shadowy groups pulling the strings, we'll stop focusing on the puppets and start focusing on the controllers, and then there goes your new world order down the toilet.
[00:13:14.913 --> 00:13:15.893]  Down the you-know-what-er.
[00:13:15.913 --> 00:13:21.236]  And as we know, all toilets lead to the White House.
[00:13:23.348 --> 00:13:24.809]  Forget the G7 Summit.
[00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:25.810]  They don't like this.
[00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.250]  Bilderberg is where the big guns go.
[00:13:27.511 --> 00:13:34.295]  You've already failed, Federal Police, in covering up the criminal meeting, the Spectre meeting, going on in your town.
[00:13:37.217 --> 00:13:51.766]  And oh no, we have to have the police blocking all the entrance roads, the subroads, coming into the main road, because we can't have the public seeing the black sedans and the diplomatic-plated vehicles going to meet in secret.
[00:13:52.588 --> 00:13:55.510]  I mean, this is upside-down planet.
[00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:57.271]  This is upside-down world.
[00:13:59.633 --> 00:14:06.758]  Here's what I wanted to ask the federal police, and if you go to our article on Infowars.com, Kurt Nimmo says, voice your opposition.
[00:14:06.798 --> 00:14:07.898]  I totally agree with him.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:17.365]  We have all the phone numbers up there, especially if you live in Europe, live in Austria, in surrounding areas, you've got to call them.
[00:14:19.113 --> 00:14:25.956]  And say the world is watching, what are you doing trampling free speech for war criminals like Henry Kissinger?
[00:14:26.276 --> 00:14:27.796]  Give us a break!
[00:14:31.357 --> 00:14:40.721]  And we've got the state police number, the federal police number, the traffic information center, the federal police number,
[00:14:42.193 --> 00:14:45.255]  They're all there with the country codes, everything.
[00:14:45.595 --> 00:14:48.637]  Call the public relations offices and say, how dare you?
[00:14:48.878 --> 00:15:07.451]  Because now the story is going to be about the secret group of fat cats, the secret group of fat cats meeting and then wanting to keep the peasants back six and a half miles, and then when the peasants dare put up YouTube videos showing the checkpoints,
[00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:16.436]  Police with their eyes bugging out, basically stormed the hotel, guaranteed trying to get our reporters kicked out of it.
[00:15:17.056 --> 00:15:26.403]  And then once they've got them kicked out, like we've seen before, then they won't let them up the road within two miles of the hotel.
[00:15:27.884 --> 00:15:30.726]  And they've told them, you are not to go on any of the National Park trails.
[00:15:31.467 --> 00:15:33.988]  They're harassing people that are skiing, people that are hiking.
[00:15:34.669 --> 00:15:37.351]  This was going on a week and a half ago, this was in Austrian papers.
[00:15:39.451 --> 00:15:42.032]  In the middle of a tourist destination!
[00:15:42.592 --> 00:15:43.552]  This is a tourist town!
[00:15:43.812 --> 00:15:44.592]  A tourist region!
[00:15:45.593 --> 00:15:46.153]  The Alps!
[00:15:47.233 --> 00:15:49.353]  You're not welcome with the leader!
[00:15:49.654 --> 00:15:51.514]  When the Führer's come to town!
[00:15:51.854 --> 00:15:53.775]  Gruppenführer is in town!
[00:15:54.095 --> 00:15:56.815]  You little scum do not come show it!
[00:15:57.796 --> 00:15:58.956]  It's done in secret!
[00:15:59.676 --> 00:16:01.776]  Project of Adolf Hitler!
[00:16:02.277 --> 00:16:02.877]  Ein Volk!
[00:16:03.157 --> 00:16:03.737]  Ein Reich!
[00:16:04.017 --> 00:16:04.837]  Ein Führer!
[00:16:05.857 --> 00:16:06.378]  Sickening!
[00:16:06.858 --> 00:16:07.578]  Well guess what?
[00:16:08.632 --> 00:16:11.253]  You failed miserably in your attempt.
[00:16:11.633 --> 00:16:15.395]  And your attempt to smash free speech is only making it explode right now.
[00:16:15.895 --> 00:16:16.516]  You watch.
[00:16:16.996 --> 00:16:20.137]  What you're doing will now be in scores of newspapers.
[00:16:21.218 --> 00:16:22.558]  And will only draw more interest.
[00:16:22.918 --> 00:16:25.360]  And what was the only way we'd fail, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.882]  The only way we'd fail is by not going and showing their tyranny.
[00:16:31.082 --> 00:16:33.383]  Because they always act like the criminal scum they are.
[00:16:33.623 --> 00:16:37.345]  You're not allowed to look Hillary Clinton in the eyes on record at Bilderberg.
[00:16:41.035 --> 00:16:42.957]  They treat everyone like total filth.
[00:16:43.657 --> 00:16:45.579]  And their minions treat the people like filth.
[00:16:45.599 --> 00:16:47.400]  This is what they think of you.
[00:16:48.181 --> 00:16:49.022]  Unbelievable!
[00:16:50.003 --> 00:16:55.507]  Let's go to Rob Dew and Josh Owens, reporting from telephone, because Skype is down right now.
[00:16:56.448 --> 00:17:01.812]  Tell us where you are in the surrounding area, and report on the police and what you're planning.
[00:17:03.514 --> 00:17:09.479]  Alright, hey Alex, this is Rob Dew, reporting live from Misson, Austria, just right next door to tell us that
[00:17:09.961 --> 00:17:14.062]  Even smaller, Hamlet, we have a second hotel here just in case.
[00:17:14.522 --> 00:17:18.924]  We got this actually because it had better Wi-Fi and then all of a sudden the Wi-Fi seems to be acting screwy.
[00:17:19.244 --> 00:17:20.044]  Very interesting.
[00:17:20.904 --> 00:17:25.566]  But today we were down in Telf interviewing people, asking them what they thought about Bilderberg.
[00:17:26.306 --> 00:17:28.087]  Most of the older people didn't want to talk to us.
[00:17:28.807 --> 00:17:30.687]  A lot of the younger kids were interested in Bilderberg.
[00:17:30.707 --> 00:17:31.968]  A lot of them didn't know what it was.
[00:17:32.528 --> 00:17:35.449]  But during all that, I got a call from the hotel manager.
[00:17:36.349 --> 00:17:38.270]  Uh, at the Rompenhof, where we're staying.
[00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:39.150]  We have a cabin up there.
[00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:42.452]  It's the one that's real close to Golderberg, uh, to where the Innerhoppen is.
[00:17:43.132 --> 00:17:46.234]  And he called and he wanted to know if, uh, we could pay in full on Wednesday.
[00:17:46.254 --> 00:17:49.075]  I said, yeah, you know, we have no problem, you know, paying up, whatever.
[00:17:49.475 --> 00:17:52.736]  And he goes, well, he goes, also, uh, the police were here looking for you.
[00:17:52.876 --> 00:17:53.677]  I said, really?
[00:17:53.817 --> 00:17:55.198]  I said, we already talked to the police.
[00:17:55.238 --> 00:17:56.278]  We showed them our passports.
[00:17:56.318 --> 00:18:02.881]  Why did, you know, he goes, yeah, uh, these might've been, I don't know if they were different or not, but they were asking about YouTube videos.
[00:18:03.436 --> 00:18:05.697]  And I'm kind of speaking in his broken dialect.
[00:18:05.737 --> 00:18:09.059]  He was, you know, talking in a German accent with English.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.861]  And I said, YouTube videos, okay, that's interesting.
[00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:15.143]  I said, we're, you know, is it the same police that are in the parking lot?
[00:18:15.183 --> 00:18:17.024]  Because I'll just go up and talk to them when we come back up.
[00:18:17.044 --> 00:18:19.525]  He goes, no, they came from a different area.
[00:18:19.625 --> 00:18:22.727]  I think these are more like, like your FBI or something.
[00:18:23.487 --> 00:18:27.810]  So that tells me that it could be the Cobra special operators that are here.
[00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.711]  There's at least 24 of them that we know of.
[00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:33.262]  By the way, we're not joking.
[00:18:33.923 --> 00:18:39.446]  These are like Special Forces people that reside in a castle and they call themselves Cobra Security.
[00:18:39.726 --> 00:18:40.946]  You cannot make this up.
[00:18:42.627 --> 00:18:42.867]  Right.
[00:18:43.628 --> 00:18:47.650]  And maybe they saw our report John Bowne did on Cope and didn't like that.
[00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:51.152]  Or maybe they saw the report showing the checkpoint.
[00:18:51.692 --> 00:18:57.635]  Yeah, well if they don't like our free speech, they can go straight to hell with all the other fascist scum.
[00:18:59.161 --> 00:18:59.881]  That's how I feel.
[00:18:59.921 --> 00:19:10.124]  The guy tried to call me out for videotaping the checkpoint and I said, listen, you're out here doing something, you know, you're out here supposedly for this event that doesn't start till Thursday.
[00:19:10.784 --> 00:19:11.864]  And he goes, well, we're the police.
[00:19:11.924 --> 00:19:13.264]  We, you know, we have to do this.
[00:19:13.604 --> 00:19:18.546]  And he was trying to justify their tyrannical existence, what they were doing.
[00:19:20.928 --> 00:19:23.510]  After this interview, I plan on going back down into Tulsa.
[00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.813]  I'm going to go to the local police and contact them.
[00:19:26.233 --> 00:19:29.777]  I'm just going to go into the police station and say, hey, I heard you guys are looking for me.
[00:19:30.177 --> 00:19:31.438]  And we'll see where it goes from there.
[00:19:32.359 --> 00:19:38.966]  But it's very disconcerting that putting up a YouTube video is going to get you a visit from the police here in Austria.
[00:19:40.697 --> 00:19:44.258]  Well, it shows that Bilderberg has incredible power and is in deep trouble.
[00:19:44.318 --> 00:19:48.839]  I want to come back and have you narrate with us for radio listeners the video of the checkpoint.
[00:19:48.859 --> 00:19:49.920]  There's audio as well.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.021]  And this guy was bugging his eyes out at you, Rob.
[00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:55.842]  I mean, I would only look at somebody like that if I wanted to attack him.
[00:19:56.302 --> 00:19:57.922]  I mean, was he not bugging his eyes out at you?
[00:20:00.403 --> 00:20:03.304]  We're going to talk to Dew when we come back on the other side of this quick break.
[00:20:03.664 --> 00:20:05.104]  You may have lost that phone connection.
[00:20:05.124 --> 00:20:05.945]  We'll see what's happening.
[00:20:06.325 --> 00:20:06.765]  Stay with us.
[00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:15.932]  It's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the industry leader, MyPatriotSupply.

[00:21:09.209 --> 00:21:14.393]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[00:21:14.493 --> 00:21:19.236]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[00:21:19.356 --> 00:21:23.239]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease.
[00:21:23.399 --> 00:21:26.822]  And a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[00:21:27.062 --> 00:21:29.605]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[00:21:29.725 --> 00:21:34.089]  I've taken whey protein products for years, and I've never noticed the results I have with your product.
[00:21:34.189 --> 00:21:37.152]  I've suffered with thoughts of constipation most of my life.
[00:21:37.373 --> 00:21:41.297]  Within a few days of taking One World Whey, I noticed a dramatic change.
[00:21:41.697 --> 00:21:45.421]  Also in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[00:21:45.621 --> 00:21:49.064]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar, and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[00:21:49.665 --> 00:21:49.825]  Call 888-988-3325.
[00:21:49.845 --> 00:21:50.265]  That's 888-988-3325.

[00:22:38.775 --> 00:22:48.020]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:48.820]  This capitalism?
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:54.983]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:55.043 --> 00:22:58.665]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:09.291]  Hey, Berky Guy here.
[00:23:09.371 --> 00:23:11.074]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[00:23:11.214 --> 00:23:12.876]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[00:23:12.976 --> 00:23:14.798]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?
[00:23:14.939 --> 00:23:20.806]  The Berky Guy is here to help you remove these and other potential contaminants from your water, thus helping you drink clean, purified water.

[00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:46.720]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:47.860]  Silver Lungs.
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:55.143]  With the addition of our unique lung delivery system, respiratory infections are targeted directly, where traditional oral administration simply cannot reach.
[00:23:55.323 --> 00:24:01.226]  This pioneering method also preserves the original particle sizes and delivers your silver solution directly into the bloodstream.
[00:24:01.346 --> 00:24:05.407]  See the Silver Lungs generator and lung delivery system at SilverLungs.com.
[00:24:05.487 --> 00:24:07.188]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[00:24:19.762 --> 00:24:23.323]  We do have our reporters now connected to Skype video.
[00:24:23.823 --> 00:24:29.205]  If you're a radio listener, go to InfoWars.com forward slash show to find the free video feed.
[00:24:29.225 --> 00:24:30.646]  We're also on Ustream.
[00:24:30.666 --> 00:24:35.087]  Of course, The Nightly News is a subscriber at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:24:35.527 --> 00:24:36.667]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:24:37.988 --> 00:24:46.671]  If you just tuned in, our reporters are covering the globalist meeting, the top globalist meeting that they kept secret for about 40 years.
[00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:51.092]  In the last 15 or so, we've blown it wide open.
[00:24:52.352 --> 00:24:59.657]  Thanks to Jim Tucker, and of course the listeners of this broadcast, WorldNet Daily, Drugs Report, and many others.
[00:25:01.978 --> 00:25:05.980]  Now it's all over international press, and the Austrian police are flipping out.
[00:25:07.921 --> 00:25:11.404]  Federal police are looking for our reporters.
[00:25:11.824 --> 00:25:15.186]  They're not hiding, they're just getting on record what happened before they go looking for them.
[00:25:16.403 --> 00:25:17.524]  And the sky's the limit.
[00:25:18.345 --> 00:25:20.246]  There's a tyrannical takeover taking place.
[00:25:20.286 --> 00:25:25.049]  In the next segment, I'll play the video of the checkpoint, now that we have the connection with Dew and others.
[00:25:25.069 --> 00:25:29.793]  Then I have a special report by John Bowne on how TPP is in trouble.
[00:25:30.673 --> 00:25:32.254]  And remember, this is the group behind it all.
[00:25:32.975 --> 00:25:38.419]  And the 150 members sit on all the other major boards and internationalist groups.
[00:25:38.879 --> 00:25:41.361]  But this is the very center of the spiderweb.
[00:25:42.878 --> 00:25:44.579]  This is just a continuation of the G7.
[00:25:45.399 --> 00:25:47.760]  Rob, do other points you think are important to make?
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.721]  They're about six, seven miles away from Bilderberg.
[00:25:52.102 --> 00:25:54.083]  And other points that Josh Owens thinks we should know.
[00:25:54.103 --> 00:26:09.069]  Well, before anything happened this morning, when we were leaving our hotel, we got, we were talking to another blogger who's staying there at the hotel, and he said they've actually made the security perimeter, supposedly, smaller.
[00:26:09.605 --> 00:26:12.007]  So they said now we can walk up to the bus depot.
[00:26:12.487 --> 00:26:21.333]  And I think that might be in part due to some of the videos we put up because I think somebody probably saw this and made a few phone calls and said, look, you can't treat people like this.
[00:26:22.133 --> 00:26:24.995]  So I think that was a pretty important development that happened overnight.
[00:26:25.015 --> 00:26:27.357]  I haven't looked at the report.
[00:26:27.397 --> 00:26:38.384]  I was just told that in Austrian press, the government issued an order or decree, whatever they issued, that said they're shrinking the security perimeter and it's not as big as it once was.
[00:26:40.129 --> 00:26:44.893]  As we're getting closer to the event, the security perimeter is shrinking, which I think is a good thing.
[00:26:45.294 --> 00:26:48.056]  Because this is, you know, taxpayer-funded security at this point.
[00:26:48.517 --> 00:26:51.259]  Plus, a security perimeter that big won't work.
[00:26:52.921 --> 00:26:53.701]  Right, exactly.
[00:26:53.962 --> 00:26:56.784]  Yeah, you cannot have that much security.
[00:26:57.465 --> 00:26:59.987]  There's just no way to do it with that many people.
[00:27:00.247 --> 00:27:05.452]  And today, they actually moved the checkpoint from down in Kelp up the mountain.
[00:27:05.999 --> 00:27:08.261]  Yeah, you should go in there and have lunch.
[00:27:08.341 --> 00:27:10.062]  You should go in there and have lunch.
[00:27:10.102 --> 00:27:11.923]  Robby, let me ask you this question.
[00:27:11.963 --> 00:27:13.844]  Let me ask you this question.
[00:27:37.961 --> 00:27:39.221]  Bill, I forgot what the question was.
[00:27:39.941 --> 00:27:40.462]  Just go ahead.
[00:27:41.882 --> 00:27:49.504]  Well, I am not too concerned about the fact that if they have a problem with me putting up YouTube videos, I'll gladly go there and have a dialogue.
[00:27:50.024 --> 00:27:52.765]  But I'm going to record it, and I'm going to let them know, hey, I'm recording this.
[00:27:53.365 --> 00:27:58.606]  You know, if you have a problem with reporters, then just say you have a problem with reporters, and we can get that on the record.
[00:27:58.926 --> 00:28:00.026]  And then we can have more discourse.
[00:28:00.046 --> 00:28:00.846]  Because that's the problem.
[00:28:01.167 --> 00:28:02.787]  Bilderberg is all based on secrecy.
[00:28:03.154 --> 00:28:09.922]  So we gotta stop having the secrecy continue to ebb out in through the society and culture that nobody can say anything about voter birth.
[00:28:10.162 --> 00:28:11.644]  Nobody can say anything about security.
[00:28:11.784 --> 00:28:13.066]  Nobody can say anything about anything.
[00:28:13.086 --> 00:28:20.875]  We've got to sit here, shut up, and take it as these elites come up here to this mountain retreat, invade this town, and put all these people essentially on lockdown.
[00:28:22.881 --> 00:28:26.823]  A lot of the young people, a lot of their answer was, I said, look, you have to put out a guess.
[00:28:26.843 --> 00:28:27.703]  What is the Goldberg Group?
[00:28:27.723 --> 00:28:28.163]  A music group?
[00:28:45.208 --> 00:28:46.429]  No, it's not a music group.
[00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:48.592]  And then I would explain to him what Bilderberg is.
[00:28:48.672 --> 00:28:50.614]  And I'm like, do you think we should have secret meetings?
[00:28:50.674 --> 00:28:52.576]  One guy actually said, yes, we should.
[00:28:52.596 --> 00:28:54.759]  And then I had to talk to him a little bit more.
[00:28:55.219 --> 00:28:56.481]  And then I said, I'm going to ask you again.
[00:28:56.501 --> 00:28:59.564]  Do you think we should have these meetings in secret?
[00:28:59.584 --> 00:29:00.385]  And we don't know what's going on.
[00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:01.326]  He's like, no, that's bad.
[00:29:01.366 --> 00:29:02.127]  He was with his two buddies.
[00:29:02.147 --> 00:29:03.148]  They didn't speak much English.
[00:29:03.208 --> 00:29:03.649]  I said, listen.
[00:29:04.181 --> 00:29:08.044]  You need to go back to your house, look it up on the internet, and start talking to your friends about it.
[00:29:08.084 --> 00:29:09.626]  Because that's the only way this is going to change.
[00:29:10.086 --> 00:29:15.671]  This is only going to change when we start talking about secret elite meetings that we can't talk about.
[00:29:15.951 --> 00:29:17.032]  That press are invited to.
[00:29:17.212 --> 00:29:19.053]  The head of The Economist is invited to.
[00:29:19.694 --> 00:29:22.837]  I mean, there's all kinds of... Bloomberg is there.
[00:29:23.437 --> 00:29:24.858]  Okay, but they're not going to talk about it.
[00:29:25.018 --> 00:29:31.304]  Hillary Clinton's chief advisor is on the list, and look at this.
[00:29:32.659 --> 00:29:37.083]  They can only operate in secret so they can tell the public none of these groups exist.
[00:29:37.623 --> 00:29:43.289]  Since they've told the public this forever, they're desperate to keep the public from learning that no, actually, these groups do exist.
[00:29:44.249 --> 00:29:45.310]  Rob, great job.
[00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:49.995]  I want to come back and get Josh's take on what's happened in the last 24 hours.
[00:29:50.475 --> 00:29:52.297]  Then we're going to play the clip of the checkpoint.
[00:29:52.317 --> 00:29:53.758]  Then I'm going to get the John Bounds report.
[00:29:54.739 --> 00:29:58.863]  And then you guys are going to go out and try to find the federal police on video.
[00:29:59.605 --> 00:30:02.612]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.554 --> 00:30:06.220]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:11.212 --> 00:30:18.539]  Fresh Off reports that their acting head resigned because of a 96% failure rate, the TSA is in the news once again.
[00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:24.766]  This time with a notice that 73 of its own employees were flagged for terrorism.
[00:30:25.627 --> 00:30:29.390]  I guess the hiring managers skipped the class on how to read people's minds.
[00:30:30.211 --> 00:30:40.755]  Now, to be fair, the agency may be confused on what a terrorist actually is when they're being ordered to give VIP treatment to the Muslim Brotherhood, a known terrorist organization.
[00:30:41.455 --> 00:30:45.197]  The terrorist distinction came after the group bombed an Egyptian police department.
[00:30:45.777 --> 00:30:50.359]  Also, there have been numerous examples of TSA putting innocent people on watch lists.
[00:30:51.423 --> 00:30:57.791]  Small children having the red flag of a terrorist because they simply share the same name of a known offender.
[00:30:58.852 --> 00:31:04.439]  The agency is in need of long overdue reform, if not outright abolishment.
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.565]  You can find more reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:31:10.262 --> 00:31:15.024]  Alex Jones here with Infowarslife.com Consumer Alert Report.
[00:31:15.424 --> 00:31:22.466]  Many of you are aware that around the world, most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[00:31:22.767 --> 00:31:30.529]  The good news is, our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:31.830]  The bad news is,
[00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:39.453]  For the first time in more than a year, supplies at Infowarslife.com of Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine are running low.
[00:31:39.833 --> 00:31:44.255]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these Deep Earth Crystals.
[00:31:44.635 --> 00:31:51.819]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary and only available to Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:51.999 --> 00:31:54.900]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:01.830]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:06.116]  Available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:26.437]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[00:32:26.677 --> 00:32:30.181]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[00:32:30.521 --> 00:32:34.185]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:32:34.566 --> 00:32:35.827]  Hdfirearms.com.
[00:32:36.107 --> 00:32:39.311]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[00:32:39.431 --> 00:32:44.337]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[00:32:44.537 --> 00:32:45.418]  It's always about security.
[00:32:45.418 --> 00:32:45.758]  I think so.
[00:33:24.358 --> 00:33:30.680]  You are a programmable guy that goes and watches Olympus is Falling, and believes all this, and really thinks you're a hero!
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:31.520]  G.I.
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.581]  Joe, Great American Hero!
[00:33:33.881 --> 00:33:34.681]  Yo, Joe!
[00:33:35.062 --> 00:33:36.282]  You don't work for Joe!
[00:33:36.502 --> 00:33:37.662]  Joe got taken over!
[00:33:38.543 --> 00:33:39.063]  The G.I.
[00:33:39.103 --> 00:33:41.724]  Joe command base is run by Cobra!
[00:33:42.484 --> 00:33:43.324]  You understand that?
[00:33:43.704 --> 00:33:48.686]  And I use a child analogy to get through to you, because that's your main programming template in North America.
[00:33:48.886 --> 00:33:49.826]  They're on record with that!
[00:33:50.246 --> 00:33:51.707]  That was all Pentagon directed!
[00:33:52.307 --> 00:33:53.888]  You understand you work for Cobra.
[00:33:54.148 --> 00:33:55.388]  You dress like Cobra.
[00:33:55.608 --> 00:33:57.029]  You have the tactics of Cobra.
[00:33:57.289 --> 00:33:58.389]  You are Cobra.
[00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:59.610]  Hail Cobra!
[00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:01.550]  You want to be little boys?
[00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:03.991]  Or do you want to really join the Republic?
[00:34:04.491 --> 00:34:09.373]  They know what's going on at the Bundy Ranch, and they won't even let a police information officer give us any information.
[00:34:09.613 --> 00:34:10.374]  That's a bunch of bull****.
[00:34:10.814 --> 00:34:12.214]  It's all these stupid G.I.
[00:34:12.254 --> 00:34:14.915]  Joe movies and stuff, where the White House is attacked.
[00:34:15.115 --> 00:34:16.836]  The White House is run by Cobra!
[00:34:17.356 --> 00:34:25.200]  When I went through the process of becoming Press Secretary, one of the first things they told me was, you're not even to acknowledge the drone program.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.821]  You're not even to discuss that it exists.
[00:34:28.402 --> 00:34:29.562]  It's run by chaos!
[00:34:30.023 --> 00:34:31.183]  It's run by Spectre!
[00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:36.506]  Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, Extortion.
[00:34:37.367 --> 00:34:41.031]  They run little kids, they run the snuff films, they run the drugs, they run it all.
[00:34:41.171 --> 00:34:45.855]  And because you have like a bunch of naive chumps, this whole thing's gonna come down on us!
[00:34:46.195 --> 00:34:51.961]  Very much concerns me, considering that they have all this bulk ammunition that they're shooting targets of children.
[00:34:52.481 --> 00:34:54.583]  Would you like to tell me who it is that is doing this?
[00:34:55.104 --> 00:34:56.966]  It is the Department of Homeland Security, sir.
[00:34:57.646 --> 00:34:59.008]  Oh, thank you for calling.
[00:34:59.608 --> 00:35:05.291]  To every police officer in this country, to every FBI agent, to every Secret Service agent, you work for Spectre.
[00:35:05.731 --> 00:35:06.812]  You work for Chaos.
[00:35:07.032 --> 00:35:08.013]  You work for Cobra.
[00:35:12.115 --> 00:35:12.935]  How do they get power?
[00:35:13.075 --> 00:35:17.578]  They stage a terror attack using Spectre, using Cobra.
[00:35:21.894 --> 00:35:22.595]  Go f*** yourself.
[00:35:23.115 --> 00:35:23.716]  Who is COBRA?
[00:35:23.896 --> 00:35:27.418]  Arms dealing, drug dealing, money laundering group, wearing masks.
[00:35:27.719 --> 00:35:31.642]  They wear masks, ladies and gentlemen, because they're the corporate CEOs.
[00:35:32.242 --> 00:35:34.504]  And they're manipulating the governments against each other.
[00:35:35.025 --> 00:35:36.326]  COBRA runs the Muslims.
[00:35:36.586 --> 00:35:38.127]  COBRA runs the CIA.
[00:35:38.407 --> 00:35:39.548]  COBRA runs it all.
[00:35:39.808 --> 00:35:40.829]  COBRA is real.
[00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:42.771]  You can call it whatever you want.
[00:35:44.108 --> 00:35:45.909]  Cobra is in control of America.
[00:35:46.189 --> 00:35:52.032]  And Cobra says the veterans and the gun owners, they're saying that we're the bad guys.
[00:35:52.172 --> 00:35:57.035]  These people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not.
[00:35:57.555 --> 00:35:59.676]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[00:36:00.056 --> 00:36:01.457]  That's what Cobra would say.
[00:36:01.677 --> 00:36:03.058]  That's what Specter would say.
[00:36:03.418 --> 00:36:04.979]  That's what Goldfinger would say.
[00:36:05.199 --> 00:36:07.200]  Because that's who those people are.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:12.482]  I am Supreme Cobra Commander!
[00:36:12.522 --> 00:36:17.343]  You call your petty bureaucrats officials and authorities?
[00:36:17.503 --> 00:36:21.925]  You will kneel before Cobra of faith!
[00:36:24.005 --> 00:36:27.568]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:36:28.108 --> 00:36:29.969]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:33.512]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Cobra Leader.
[00:36:33.672 --> 00:36:35.773]  You pathetic little worm!
[00:36:35.913 --> 00:36:40.837]  How dare you call me Mr. Cobra!
[00:36:43.439 --> 00:36:45.760]  I don't know, but whoever's doing that Cobra voice is good.
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.843]  I mean, that is a dead ringer for the 1980s cartoon.
[00:36:49.243 --> 00:36:51.504]  That person has got skills as a voiceover person.
[00:36:52.505 --> 00:36:53.025]  Cobra!
[00:36:54.481 --> 00:36:57.622]  Our Cobra forces are in control in Austria.
[00:36:58.082 --> 00:37:02.043]  We have the government serving us as we destroy their sovereignty.
[00:37:03.644 --> 00:37:05.144]  Hail Cobra!
[00:37:05.404 --> 00:37:09.165]  The foolishness of the public will allow the final takeover.
[00:37:11.366 --> 00:37:16.867]  Oh, our reporters are so scared the special ops Cobra team is after them.
[00:37:17.447 --> 00:37:19.828]  As if we didn't already know you guys are crooks.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.742]  I always love it when I get a death threat or a dirty trick or something.
[00:37:29.503 --> 00:37:33.365]  Or the Feds will be harassing me in person sometimes when I've covered Bilderberg or other events.
[00:37:34.265 --> 00:37:36.846]  They'll be freaked out that I'm not scared and I start laughing at them.
[00:37:38.267 --> 00:37:42.048]  And I've said on air too, don't you get it?
[00:37:42.348 --> 00:37:43.389]  I already know.
[00:37:44.366 --> 00:37:47.767]  That the government runs the child kidnapping rings and ships in the drugs.
[00:37:48.307 --> 00:37:50.288]  I already know you run the major mafias.
[00:37:50.308 --> 00:37:51.708]  I already know you kill people.
[00:37:52.088 --> 00:37:53.249]  What do you think I'm doing?
[00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:54.409]  I'm engaging you!
[00:37:54.429 --> 00:37:56.010]  DO WHATEVER YOU'RE GONNA DO!
[00:37:56.290 --> 00:37:57.710]  I'M NOT SCUM LIKE YOU!
[00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:00.191]  YOU GO TO YOUR DADDY SATAN ANYTIME YOU WANT!
[00:38:00.411 --> 00:38:01.471]  I'LL NEVER JOIN YOU!
[00:38:01.731 --> 00:38:02.952]  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT FILTH?
[00:38:03.672 --> 00:38:06.053]  MOST OF YOU ARE TOO COWARDLY TO ADMIT WHAT SIDE YOU'RE ON!
[00:38:06.073 --> 00:38:06.733]  I KNOW!
[00:38:10.871 --> 00:38:11.331]  Scum!
[00:38:12.092 --> 00:38:13.113]  Think you intimidate us?
[00:38:13.133 --> 00:38:14.353]  You don't do anything!
[00:38:14.834 --> 00:38:19.897]  Your criminal activities and your attempt to smash free speech will blow up in your face!
[00:38:20.497 --> 00:38:21.998]  So go ahead and play your cards.
[00:38:22.218 --> 00:38:23.199]  Put them on the table!
[00:38:23.739 --> 00:38:24.680]  Play your hand!
[00:38:27.979 --> 00:38:28.500]  Sick of it!
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.961]  Sick of you getting away with all your crap!
[00:38:31.542 --> 00:38:37.065]  And now you want to silence everybody worldwide and silence the press so you can have your way with the rest of humanity?
[00:38:37.085 --> 00:38:41.248]  So you can abort hundreds of millions of more babies every year worldwide?
[00:38:42.049 --> 00:38:42.489]  No!
[00:38:42.509 --> 00:38:44.270]  So you can kill old people?
[00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:46.412]  So you can put veterans on the don't treat list?
[00:38:46.712 --> 00:38:48.093]  So you can treat humanity like crap?
[00:38:48.633 --> 00:38:52.756]  Build a world where parasites and psychopaths run everything?
[00:38:52.776 --> 00:38:52.816]  No!
[00:38:54.037 --> 00:38:55.518]  Good people are stronger than you!
[00:38:56.755 --> 00:38:59.976]  We're gonna get a hold of your arm, like Beowulf grabbing Grendel's arm.
[00:38:59.996 --> 00:39:01.856]  We're gonna tear it politically out of the socket.
[00:39:02.136 --> 00:39:04.137]  And you already know we've got our hand on your arm.
[00:39:04.157 --> 00:39:05.317]  You're not going anywhere.
[00:39:05.337 --> 00:39:09.198]  You look over at us and say, you know, I'm big and evil.
[00:39:09.478 --> 00:39:12.198]  You don't think we don't already know what slime you are?
[00:39:12.858 --> 00:39:13.798]  Get it through your head.
[00:39:13.818 --> 00:39:14.539]  I know.
[00:39:14.859 --> 00:39:15.239]  I know.
[00:39:15.479 --> 00:39:16.379]  Do you understand?
[00:39:16.659 --> 00:39:17.059]  I know.
[00:39:17.079 --> 00:39:18.079]  I know.
[00:39:18.099 --> 00:39:20.020]  I know you better than you do.
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:20.920]  I know!
[00:39:25.333 --> 00:39:29.554]  They're a bunch of snakes to be trampled underfoot!
[00:39:30.014 --> 00:39:31.815]  And you will be in the dustbin of history.
[00:39:32.795 --> 00:39:34.635]  Excuse me, let me settle down before I get to these reports.
[00:39:35.295 --> 00:39:41.097]  Just police harassing our reporters, police trying to intimidate free speech, police trying to act like we're criminals and bad.
[00:39:41.357 --> 00:39:51.059]  Makes me want to throw up while a bunch of criminals, known criminals meet in secret on taxpayer dime, hoping we don't expose their criminal operations.
[00:39:51.299 --> 00:39:53.460]  We've already exposed them and we're not going to stop.
[00:39:54.667 --> 00:39:55.848]  And it's not just Infowars.
[00:39:56.288 --> 00:39:58.309]  We've already reached critical mass and everybody knows it.
[00:39:59.489 --> 00:40:01.991]  It is my goal to face you.
[00:40:02.311 --> 00:40:03.311]  It is my goal.
[00:40:03.411 --> 00:40:04.812]  Escape is not our plan.
[00:40:08.854 --> 00:40:09.695]  Let's go ahead now.
[00:40:09.735 --> 00:40:11.135]  We're not cowards like you.
[00:40:11.355 --> 00:40:13.497]  We don't operate in packs like you.
[00:40:13.797 --> 00:40:14.557]  We're individuals.
[00:40:15.498 --> 00:40:17.278]  We value freedom above everything else.
[00:40:17.759 --> 00:40:19.420]  We value justice above everything.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.941]  We value defense of the innocent above everything!
[00:40:23.908 --> 00:40:24.749]  I detest you!
[00:40:24.769 --> 00:40:27.914]  You hate us?
[00:40:28.294 --> 00:40:29.256]  I hate you right back!
[00:40:32.142 --> 00:40:33.163]  Let's go to Josh Owens.
[00:40:33.223 --> 00:40:33.943]  Excuse me, Josh.
[00:40:33.963 --> 00:40:35.244]  Go ahead, give us your take.
[00:40:35.624 --> 00:40:37.365]  Josh Owens, reporter, Infowars.com.
[00:40:37.625 --> 00:41:00.259]  They're in Austria seeing the disgusting worship of tyranny, the disgusting police just rolling out a simpering, hateful red carpet against the locals, just brooding over them sycophantically, crouching down to lick the hands of the filthy, fetid, Bilderberg, wart-covered proboscis of Henry Kissinger, vomiting delicious goodies into their mouths.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:00.880]  Go ahead.
[00:41:03.035 --> 00:41:04.416]  Josh Owens at Footwars.com.
[00:41:04.836 --> 00:41:14.921]  Surprisingly enough, when I got up this morning to leave this hotel to go meet Dew at the cabin, the police presence has ramped up an insane amount.
[00:41:15.161 --> 00:41:30.509]  When I pulled out of this hotel driving down the street, there were 15, 16, that I could see because the roads are winding up on this mountain, of police caravans, vans, completely packed full, probably, what would you say, 20?
[00:41:30.549 --> 00:41:32.010]  20 policemen in each van.
[00:41:33.254 --> 00:41:33.734]  Behind me.
[00:41:33.975 --> 00:41:34.715]  So I swerved over.
[00:41:34.755 --> 00:41:37.417]  You can see the video on the Alex Jones Channel.
[00:41:38.018 --> 00:41:45.784]  I swerved over and pulled the camera up and you can see them just passing by the car.
[00:41:46.385 --> 00:41:47.305]  One after the other.
[00:41:47.806 --> 00:41:49.767]  The ones I got on camera, I think 14, 15.
[00:41:49.827 --> 00:41:51.489]  There were even more before that.
[00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:57.974]  It's just unbelievable that there are this many police out here and it hasn't even started yet.
[00:41:59.281 --> 00:42:10.165]  Well, when they violate free speech and protect these criminals from the light of exposure, not from violence, when they do this, they transmute themselves from police into true agents of evil.
[00:42:13.187 --> 00:42:16.168]  Absolutely, and you can see the citizens in Austria
[00:42:16.866 --> 00:42:21.049]  A lot of the people that we talked to today, that Duke talked to today, they had gone through checkpoints.
[00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:23.570]  And they didn't really seem to mind it that much.
[00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:25.512]  They didn't really seem to bother them that much.
[00:42:25.832 --> 00:42:27.613]  They were aware of the checkpoints.
[00:42:27.653 --> 00:42:29.614]  They weren't necessarily even aware of what was going on.
[00:42:29.854 --> 00:42:37.379]  So I think that that means that this kind of stuff, probably not this level of intensity, but this kind of stuff probably happens frequently.
[00:42:37.619 --> 00:42:38.380]  And we're going to see it.
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:39.180]  We see it now.
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.021]  Yeah, it's good.
[00:42:40.061 --> 00:42:41.622]  Since time of Hitler, we do it.
[00:42:41.922 --> 00:42:42.903]  We keep it.
[00:42:42.923 --> 00:42:44.144]  Since Hitler, we like it.
[00:42:44.244 --> 00:42:44.884]  It's good.
[00:42:44.904 --> 00:42:45.765]  Hitler, good.
[00:42:45.825 --> 00:42:45.965]  Yeah.
[00:42:48.928 --> 00:42:54.991]  It's going to be interesting what the Cobra, if it is Cobra, has to say about whatever video we posted on YouTube.
[00:42:55.391 --> 00:42:56.392]  Oh my gosh!
[00:42:56.452 --> 00:42:58.012]  Cobra doesn't like it?
[00:42:58.413 --> 00:43:00.053]  Cobra doesn't like our free speech?
[00:43:00.414 --> 00:43:01.214]  You know what they can do?
[00:43:01.374 --> 00:43:02.675]  Up a rope, don't you Josh?
[00:43:05.316 --> 00:43:05.776]  I think so.
[00:43:07.557 --> 00:43:09.218]  Well hey, you guys seem very excited.
[00:43:09.418 --> 00:43:11.759]  Dew already confronted this one out of control cop.
[00:43:12.579 --> 00:43:14.520]  Are you intimidated by them, Josh?
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:15.741]  You're not acting like it.
[00:43:17.304 --> 00:43:18.885]  No, I'm not intimidated by them.
[00:43:19.305 --> 00:43:25.429]  And I just, I'm, I'm actually, I don't want to say I'm excited, but I'm very interested to see what they have to say.
[00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:31.694]  Why are they coming back to the cabin that, that Jew is staying at, that we're, that we're based out of?
[00:43:31.914 --> 00:43:37.337]  Why are they coming back there to see our passports again and to talk to us about a YouTube video?
[00:43:37.377 --> 00:43:41.360]  As if a YouTube video is such a major threat to the masters that they're serving.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:42.601]  It just makes no sense.
[00:43:43.117 --> 00:43:47.418]  Well, they think you're going to roll over like a dog, a whipped dog on your back and begin, you know.
[00:43:49.239 --> 00:43:50.279]  It's just crazy.
[00:43:50.399 --> 00:43:52.700]  I mean, it's just, it shows how out of control government is.
[00:43:54.261 --> 00:43:55.401]  We just lost our Skype feed.
[00:43:55.961 --> 00:43:56.641]  Let's go to phone.
[00:43:57.022 --> 00:44:03.244]  Let's contrast that to the UK, where the police, we had over 3,000 people there.
[00:44:03.664 --> 00:44:05.464]  It was a huge event, international news.
[00:44:06.005 --> 00:44:06.945]  No one was arrested.
[00:44:08.745 --> 00:44:10.186]  One guy jumped the fence and was detained.
[00:44:11.872 --> 00:44:16.258]  We exposed it, the media had to admit, yeah, it's a bad thing, the Bilderberg's happening, probably illegal.
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:21.766]  In the US, the police leave us alone, just no media covers it, just showing how controlled things are here.
[00:44:23.115 --> 00:44:27.618]  But in Austria, it's worse than Third World Police State Turkey, where we covered it.
[00:44:28.359 --> 00:44:32.541]  There the police were like, real apologetic, but, we are told not to let you film.
[00:44:32.862 --> 00:44:33.442]  Please don't.
[00:44:33.942 --> 00:44:36.264]  They get angry with them.
[00:44:36.504 --> 00:44:41.728]  They were just scared, and then following us around, filming us and taking photos, but they look very embarrassed.
[00:44:42.088 --> 00:44:44.149]  In Austria, they just get off on it.
[00:44:44.409 --> 00:44:49.293]  What is it like for you, Josh, to see the ecstasy that these guys have prancing around in their uniforms?
[00:44:51.155 --> 00:45:00.360]  Well, listeners can see in the video I posted last night of our confrontation at the checkpoint, the one guy, that's why I froze the still of him looking into the car.
[00:45:01.921 --> 00:45:16.630]  He walked by the car, and you can see this in the video, he walked by the car, leaned over, looked in with just those dead eyes, looked in and put his hand on his gun as if we were about to do something, as if he was about to have to use his gun on us because we were sitting in the car.
[00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:18.811]  Being very polite at that.
[00:45:19.759 --> 00:45:22.820]  And so he comes over to do and makes this smart comment.
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:31.424]  And then he goes into a tirade, basically making himself look like a complete moron, acting like they are the saviors of people.
[00:45:31.824 --> 00:45:35.185]  And he said something like, we do not protect just this week.
[00:45:35.285 --> 00:45:36.326]  We protect all year.
[00:45:36.386 --> 00:45:37.286]  It's our job.
[00:45:37.566 --> 00:45:41.948]  You know, putting himself on such a high pedestal that it was it was laughable almost.
[00:45:42.768 --> 00:45:44.629]  I mean, the arrogance of these people.
[00:45:45.009 --> 00:45:47.190]  Can this guy even do a Cobra Commander imitation?
[00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:47.470]  No.
[00:45:48.936 --> 00:45:50.137]  I mean, that's the real test.
[00:45:51.798 --> 00:45:53.960]  I think that's what we'll ask when we go to the police.
[00:45:58.203 --> 00:45:59.984]  Alright, Josh Owens, great job.
[00:46:02.052 --> 00:46:06.595]  So you're going to go to the police station, and I'll just be filming openly, and they say, what are you doing?
[00:46:06.615 --> 00:46:07.815]  I say, well, you've got cameras right here.
[00:46:07.835 --> 00:46:09.236]  You have checkpoints.
[00:46:09.296 --> 00:46:11.397]  I mean, isn't your national symbol a camera?
[00:46:12.458 --> 00:46:13.299]  Or is it an ostrich?
[00:46:13.959 --> 00:46:18.642]  Or is it Arnold Schwarzenegger's rear end with all the steroid injection shot points?
[00:46:19.542 --> 00:46:20.423]  I mean, what is it?
[00:46:21.203 --> 00:46:22.164]  Is it Kurt Voltheim?
[00:46:23.894 --> 00:46:26.595]  And then just point out, hey, they're looking for us.
[00:46:27.056 --> 00:46:27.676]  Here we are.
[00:46:27.956 --> 00:46:28.997]  We're evil reporters.
[00:46:29.037 --> 00:46:30.177]  We turn ourselves in.
[00:46:30.657 --> 00:46:31.498]  We're so horrible.
[00:46:32.618 --> 00:46:44.304]  Obviously, cash a lot of your equipment back at one hotel, because if they really get nasty, they may try to, you know, grab all your stuff and Lord knows do what, but just get ready and take a photo before you go in and tweet that out.
[00:46:45.665 --> 00:46:53.329]  I had real Alex Jones, but Josh, when are you planning to do that so we can maybe see you on live stream, maybe see if you can Skype as you go in.
[00:46:55.427 --> 00:46:57.428]  Uh, we are gonna go as soon as we get off the show.
[00:46:57.928 --> 00:47:04.470]  Okay, how far away is it so I can time it, you know, to make sure you get out of the car and go in, um, right before you get there?
[00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:08.271]  The station is probably ten miles from where we are right now.
[00:47:08.291 --> 00:47:11.032]  Alright, is it a state police, local police, or federal?
[00:47:11.052 --> 00:47:16.354]  Uh, I believe it's, um, local police.
[00:47:17.113 --> 00:47:25.841]  Well, I know that there's a smorgasbord of different police out there, but maybe you should just go find the... I know some are feds, some are state police.
[00:47:26.141 --> 00:47:28.323]  Are those checkpoints federal or state police checkpoints?
[00:47:30.284 --> 00:47:31.585]  I believe they're state police.
[00:47:32.466 --> 00:47:34.108]  Well, why don't you go find their lordships?
[00:47:34.648 --> 00:47:36.129]  You could go find them there, too.
[00:47:37.991 --> 00:47:40.693]  And, you know, pull up, get out.
[00:47:40.773 --> 00:47:42.154]  What are you doing talking to us?
[00:47:42.195 --> 00:47:43.235]  We are such gods!
[00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:45.631]  You do not talk to me, scum!
[00:47:46.612 --> 00:47:48.093]  Well, we're going to do whatever you want.
[00:47:48.113 --> 00:47:51.435]  Go find the state, the feds, the local police, do whatever you want.
[00:47:52.076 --> 00:47:52.896]  Josh, great job.
[00:47:52.936 --> 00:47:53.997]  We really appreciate your work.
[00:47:54.037 --> 00:47:54.757]  We'll be watching.
[00:47:55.038 --> 00:47:57.419]  Call us, Skype us right before you do it, okay?
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:47:59.361]  Absolutely.
[00:47:59.401 --> 00:47:59.841]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:48:00.001 --> 00:48:00.441]  Thank you.
[00:48:00.461 --> 00:48:07.106]  We're going to skip this network break, the only one of the day, so that I can get to the actual checkpoint video that he's talking about.
[00:48:07.446 --> 00:48:10.769]  If you're a radio listener, InfoWars.com has the video posted.
[00:48:12.295 --> 00:48:17.418]  You can also watch us restream it at Infowars.com forward slash show and send that link out to folks.
[00:48:18.119 --> 00:48:28.046]  We're going to post on the front page the live link video of this transmission so you can share that with friends and family as well.
[00:48:29.346 --> 00:48:35.851]  But this is important, and if I get excited and start barking back at the globalist minions, this is a big deal.
[00:48:36.601 --> 00:48:38.022]  This is the trampling of freedom.
[00:48:38.042 --> 00:48:39.804]  This shows you Europe's fall into tyranny.
[00:48:41.085 --> 00:48:43.307]  It just shows the darkness growing all over the planet.
[00:48:44.227 --> 00:48:46.269]  But the good news is their agendas are in trouble.
[00:48:46.329 --> 00:48:48.471]  We're fighting back and we will gain ground.
[00:48:48.491 --> 00:48:49.452]  We will gain steam.
[00:48:49.892 --> 00:48:51.614]  We will defend free speech worldwide.
[00:48:51.634 --> 00:48:53.075]  We will defend the press worldwide.
[00:48:53.415 --> 00:48:55.537]  We will stop NSA spying.
[00:48:55.577 --> 00:48:58.019]  We will turn the tide of tyranny.
[00:48:58.059 --> 00:48:58.479]  We have to.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:48:59.500]  We don't have a choice.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:00.922]  It's going to totally overtake us if we don't.
[00:49:01.578 --> 00:49:16.505]  And we're here just tip of the spear, trailblazing, telling the truth, making it safe to expose that ISIS is government-run, making it safe for others to attack the Federal Reserve politically, making it safe, taking the heat up front to expose our government was involved in 9-11.
[00:49:16.525 --> 00:49:17.565]  That's now mainstream news.
[00:49:17.966 --> 00:49:18.926]  It's now mainstream news.
[00:49:18.966 --> 00:49:20.647]  The government's running ISIS, as I mentioned.
[00:49:22.062 --> 00:49:38.870]  That's our job, and this morning, I don't normally, you know, get arrogant or on a power trip, but I was in the shower this morning just thinking, and I just thank God, and I leaned my head up against the stone wall, and I thought, thank God I've been protected this long.
[00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:40.830]  Thank God we've been so effective.
[00:49:41.531 --> 00:49:50.875]  Thank God that all of my problems, all of my foibles have been turned to good.
[00:49:53.439 --> 00:49:58.082]  The Lord works in mysterious ways and we are just at such a legendary, epic point.
[00:49:58.262 --> 00:49:58.963]  Humanity is.
[00:49:59.303 --> 00:50:00.984]  Within four hours, right at the tip of the spear.
[00:50:01.305 --> 00:50:02.565]  I mean, it is just surreal.
[00:50:03.386 --> 00:50:04.327]  It is surreal.
[00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:12.753]  To know the enemy's vulnerable and know they can be defeated.
[00:50:12.793 --> 00:50:13.974]  That's why they're freaking out.
[00:50:14.014 --> 00:50:18.317]  That's why they have police threatening people six miles away.
[00:50:19.332 --> 00:50:21.293]  Because they cannot be exposed.
[00:50:21.353 --> 00:50:22.314]  It's game over.
[00:50:22.694 --> 00:50:25.176]  We have approached the enemy's main lair.
[00:50:27.297 --> 00:50:33.402]  I'll keep using the analogy because we're talking about Germania here, but we're talking about the former Austrian-Hungarian Empire here.
[00:50:35.263 --> 00:50:42.027]  But I mean, we're like right there in Berlin within a hundred yards of Hitler's command base.
[00:50:42.808 --> 00:50:43.949]  I mean, that's the allegory.
[00:50:45.057 --> 00:50:50.481]  I mean, if people realize the power we have, the globalists have this con game where they ridicule it.
[00:50:50.761 --> 00:50:52.002]  Oh, Bilderberg doesn't exist.
[00:50:52.062 --> 00:50:52.863]  Is it a burger?
[00:50:53.183 --> 00:50:54.284]  What, does it got cheese on it?
[00:50:54.704 --> 00:50:57.106]  Oh, there's no secret group setting up trade deals.
[00:50:57.226 --> 00:50:59.468]  There's no death panels, dude.
[00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:01.309]  These crazy people.
[00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:03.071]  It doesn't work anymore.
[00:51:03.611 --> 00:51:11.017]  Because what they're doing is so illegal, so illegitimate, so over the top, that the minute it's forced to be admitted, it's all over.
[00:51:12.841 --> 00:51:14.903]  That's why they're racing to get a police state in place.
[00:51:15.244 --> 00:51:17.827]  They think that's gonna protect them when it all comes out.
[00:51:17.847 --> 00:51:19.849]  It's not gonna protect anything!
[00:51:21.851 --> 00:51:24.555]  You'll be thrown into that very police state you built, idiots!
[00:51:26.357 --> 00:51:31.643]  Your only hope was to not build the police state, steal everything, and then run off to some country.
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:39.384]  Now that you built this whole global police state thing, it's going to be the bear trap you set for us.
[00:51:39.884 --> 00:51:41.666]  You didn't think, step back, boom!
[00:51:41.746 --> 00:51:42.686]  It's already on your leg.
[00:51:42.946 --> 00:51:44.888]  Blood, politically, is oozing out of your leg.
[00:51:45.128 --> 00:51:46.129]  Throbbing pain.
[00:51:46.449 --> 00:51:48.030]  You're not strong enough to open it.
[00:51:50.252 --> 00:51:54.535]  And the minion you had help open it is now looking at you and is a wolf and wants to eat you.
[00:51:56.736 --> 00:51:57.537]  Smells that blood.
[00:51:58.177 --> 00:51:58.818]  You're idiots.
[00:51:58.898 --> 00:52:00.479]  You are dishonorable trash.
[00:52:02.179 --> 00:52:02.960]  You're fools.
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.561]  There is no honor among thieves.
[00:52:05.361 --> 00:52:06.582]  You sold your birthright.
[00:52:06.602 --> 00:52:10.284]  You sold everything out to this evil, stinking system.
[00:52:12.126 --> 00:52:15.448]  All because of status or something you dreamed of having.
[00:52:15.628 --> 00:52:18.630]  That if you ever had status, you'd realize how it's a prison.
[00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:19.691]  How it's nothing.
[00:52:21.112 --> 00:52:23.853]  The only reason to have status and power is for service.
[00:52:24.414 --> 00:52:25.234]  Real service.
[00:52:25.494 --> 00:52:26.735]  That's the only thing that empowers.
[00:52:27.456 --> 00:52:28.957]  Everything else brings you down.
[00:52:31.493 --> 00:52:36.777]  Let's go to this checkpoint footage as our reporters prepare to go find the police and go, what, we're evil?
[00:52:36.797 --> 00:52:37.578]  We're here with cameras?
[00:52:37.598 --> 00:52:38.458]  Oh, we're so sorry.
[00:52:38.819 --> 00:52:43.162]  Oh, we're so, it's so evil that we want to show criminal groups meeting that you're protecting.
[00:52:43.182 --> 00:52:45.644]  See, they're all involved in a criminal cover-up.
[00:52:46.265 --> 00:52:47.526]  That's why they act so guilty.
[00:52:48.447 --> 00:52:51.349]  Because their bosses have told them, whatever you do, you keep the press out of there.
[00:52:51.369 --> 00:52:53.570]  Whatever you do, you intimidate people and run them off.
[00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:56.051]  And they're going, Sir, it is not working.
[00:52:56.332 --> 00:52:57.272]  They are not afraid.
[00:52:57.332 --> 00:52:58.553]  It is in the newspaper.
[00:52:58.893 --> 00:52:59.754]  What do we do?
[00:53:00.394 --> 00:53:02.415]  Pog your eyes out more and take the cameras.
[00:53:02.475 --> 00:53:02.935]  Arrest them.
[00:53:03.316 --> 00:53:04.636]  Do whatever you have to do!
[00:53:07.958 --> 00:53:12.101]  Because if I kiss their rear end, they might let me join in one of their subgroups.
[00:53:12.621 --> 00:53:13.461]  Oh, the money.
[00:53:13.702 --> 00:53:13.902]  Oh, the...
[00:53:15.606 --> 00:53:18.128]  I mean, this is how these people think, it's how they operate.
[00:53:18.148 --> 00:53:20.570]  A bunch of social-climbing nobodies.
[00:53:24.613 --> 00:53:28.497]  The Renaissance will smash you in its teeth.
[00:53:28.577 --> 00:53:30.959]  There's nothing you can't stop, humanity fools.
[00:53:31.419 --> 00:53:32.180]  Never stop us!
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:34.361]  Never going to stop anything.
[00:53:35.042 --> 00:53:35.903]  You'll be defeated!
[00:53:36.633 --> 00:53:37.313]  Let's go ahead.
[00:53:37.333 --> 00:53:42.916]  Folks, the Bilderberg is so evil, so anti-human, so bloodthirsty, so wicked.
[00:53:43.096 --> 00:53:44.016]  That's why I get fired up.
[00:53:44.576 --> 00:53:46.977]  Because they are the enemy of everyone.
[00:53:47.017 --> 00:53:53.100]  Your children, your family, your prosperity, your wealth, your dignity, your honor.
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:54.200]  They are anathema.
[00:53:55.141 --> 00:53:56.741]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[00:53:56.781 --> 00:53:58.502]  I'll narrate the parts where there's no audio.
[00:53:58.522 --> 00:53:58.882]  Here it is.
[00:54:00.543 --> 00:54:02.744]  The video starts with him driving through the mountain road.
[00:54:03.884 --> 00:54:04.865]  Coming up to the checkpoint.
[00:54:07.034 --> 00:54:13.780]  First there's a few police vehicles, then they drive on up to the actual checkpoint, get stopped, the police scurry around.
[00:54:14.541 --> 00:54:16.963]  They've got an evil reporter, there's nothing worse.
[00:54:17.023 --> 00:54:19.025]  Notice our police have been trained reporters are bad as well.
[00:54:20.347 --> 00:54:26.653]  Even mainstream reporters get attacked now, because the enemy, the globalists, need to turn the police to their service.
[00:54:27.874 --> 00:54:30.136]  And by doing this, we expose that it's happening.
[00:54:35.524 --> 00:54:37.285]  They've gone through two different sub-checkpoints.
[00:54:37.305 --> 00:54:38.386]  Now they're being stopped at this.
[00:54:38.706 --> 00:54:40.647]  Portable buildings on the highway to search them.
[00:54:50.132 --> 00:54:54.575]  They just get off on the fact that they think they're menacing people.
[00:54:56.856 --> 00:54:58.097]  They told us to carry that with us.
[00:54:59.317 --> 00:55:00.138]  Our guys are polite.
[00:55:01.219 --> 00:55:01.639]  They're nice.
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:07.701]  Loving to check the papers.
[00:55:07.741 --> 00:55:08.782]  Our police have been trained as well.
[00:55:09.382 --> 00:55:10.242]  He says pull over there.
[00:55:12.924 --> 00:55:13.705]  Pull over there!
[00:55:15.266 --> 00:55:16.526]  Over to the side there.
[00:55:18.968 --> 00:55:19.989]  Make him wait ten minutes.
[00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:24.071]  And then here comes the lucky charms man.
[00:55:25.572 --> 00:55:26.313]  Mr. Arrogant.
[00:55:27.493 --> 00:55:28.674]  Could you just open the back side?
[00:55:28.694 --> 00:55:28.834]  Sure.
[00:55:29.335 --> 00:55:30.375]  Can you please open the back side?
[00:55:30.395 --> 00:55:31.296]  So she goes to search.
[00:55:36.889 --> 00:55:42.092]  Josh gets out to go help her open it.
[00:55:42.212 --> 00:55:48.176]  All of this is going on, the guy comes over with his hand on his gun, basically bugging his eyes out, menacing him.
[00:55:52.238 --> 00:55:59.182]  And he looks so upset, like it's so disgusting that people would dare want to know about things.
[00:55:59.202 --> 00:56:01.803]  They would dare not want to just grovel at the feet of tyranny.
[00:56:03.284 --> 00:56:05.986]  See, they're disgusted by freedom.
[00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:12.530]  Do you speak German?
[00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:14.291]  A little bit.
[00:56:14.311 --> 00:56:15.791]  A little bit?
[00:56:15.831 --> 00:56:16.671]  No, not really.
[00:56:16.951 --> 00:56:17.511]  Not really.
[00:56:17.591 --> 00:56:18.211]  Very small.
[00:56:18.591 --> 00:56:21.252]  I think it's very impolite to film persons without asking them.
[00:56:22.392 --> 00:56:23.112]  I think it's impolite.
[00:56:23.152 --> 00:56:25.173]  In Austria we say this is impolite, okay?
[00:56:25.413 --> 00:56:25.613]  Right.
[00:56:25.733 --> 00:56:26.193]  Oh, yeah.
[00:56:26.293 --> 00:56:27.873]  It's okay for you if I film you.
[00:56:28.793 --> 00:56:29.073]  Sure.
[00:56:29.213 --> 00:56:30.934]  But it's a question of character, I think, okay?
[00:56:31.554 --> 00:56:32.174]  Oh, character.
[00:56:34.374 --> 00:56:35.415]  So, Dude has bad character.
[00:56:36.635 --> 00:56:37.735]  Dude gets out to go talk to him.
[00:56:39.465 --> 00:56:45.446]  You know, I think it's a question of character that you guys have all this set up, and there's not even an event going on right now.
[00:56:45.466 --> 00:56:46.146]  There's not even what?
[00:56:46.366 --> 00:56:48.407]  There's not even an event going on right now.
[00:56:48.447 --> 00:56:51.487]  The event is not for, uh, for, what, Thursdays?
[00:56:51.547 --> 00:56:52.487]  Yes, but we are the police.
[00:56:52.507 --> 00:56:52.827]  Right.
[00:56:52.847 --> 00:56:56.208]  It's our job, and we get paid from taxes for controlling.
[00:56:56.308 --> 00:56:56.568]  I know.
[00:56:56.648 --> 00:56:59.269]  And not only if there's an event, we control the whole year.
[00:56:59.869 --> 00:57:04.710]  Sure, I mean, don't you think, don't you think people are, don't you think people are, are concerned about that?
[00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:06.230]  Like, how much taxes are they spending on this?
[00:57:07.372 --> 00:57:09.753]  Yes, I also spent taxes on this, but I can't decide it.
[00:57:09.793 --> 00:57:11.274]  But this is supposedly a private meeting.
[00:57:11.554 --> 00:57:15.315]  You know, this isn't a meeting for... This isn't the G7.
[00:57:15.355 --> 00:57:16.816]  This is a lot different.
[00:57:17.216 --> 00:57:18.556]  I mean, they say it's a private meeting.
[00:57:18.576 --> 00:57:19.377]  They don't allow press.
[00:57:19.557 --> 00:57:21.978]  Yeah, for sure, but it's a private meeting.
[00:57:23.178 --> 00:57:24.559]  Yeah, but there is danger on it.
[00:57:24.639 --> 00:57:28.020]  And we don't just save people that are officials, okay?
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:32.322]  Because if you have a party at your home and there comes a burglar, it's also your private home.
[00:57:32.462 --> 00:57:32.722]  Sure.
[00:57:32.982 --> 00:57:33.622]  And we save it.
[00:57:33.982 --> 00:57:34.202]  Correct.
[00:57:34.343 --> 00:57:35.203]  And we also save this.
[00:57:37.987 --> 00:57:44.688]  They're going to save us by working for the Bilderberg Group to treat the press like garbage and put his hand on his gun and bug his eyes out.
[00:57:45.008 --> 00:57:48.929]  But when he didn't intimidate the crew, then he got mad and ran off.
[00:57:51.369 --> 00:57:59.031]  And then he really backed down when Rob Dew got out and was towering over him, just being polite and going, man, what's your problem?
[00:58:00.391 --> 00:58:04.172]  It's normal to want to cover 150 world leaders meeting in secret.
[00:58:04.752 --> 00:58:05.452]  What's sick
[00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:13.812]  is that the western press has been so controlled they would attend it and say it didn't exist being brought into the criminal corrupt conspiracy.
[00:58:14.993 --> 00:58:17.953]  I told you we sell out of survival shield nascent iodine x tube.
[00:58:18.634 --> 00:58:28.397]  We have a small amount that's being made right now and then when that's gone I don't know what's going to happen but we have the original survival shield that a lot of folks like because it's not as strong and it's very clean as well.
[00:58:28.497 --> 00:58:29.837]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:30.357 --> 00:58:32.198]  We've only got a limited amount of that as well.
[00:58:33.078 --> 00:58:34.779]  I didn't know this other would sell out so quick.
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:38.943]  But if you want the highest quality Iodine out there, it's the second best after X2.
[00:58:38.963 --> 00:58:40.924]  And well, now it's the best because X2's gone.

[00:58:44.767 --> 00:58:46.249]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:46.609 --> 00:58:49.571]  To fund the tip of the savage spear of liberty.
[00:58:50.132 --> 00:58:51.273]  And it is savage.
[00:58:51.333 --> 00:58:51.973]  It is true.
[00:58:52.353 --> 00:58:53.534]  And it is driven by will.
[00:58:54.275 --> 00:58:55.656]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[00:59:00.262 --> 00:59:01.482]  Another major health threat.
[00:59:01.522 --> 00:59:06.423]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:59:06.503 --> 00:59:09.124]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:59:09.164 --> 00:59:15.946]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:59:16.206 --> 00:59:19.066]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:59:19.206 --> 00:59:22.127]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:59:22.147 --> 00:59:24.147]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:59:24.167 --> 00:59:27.028]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:59:27.108 --> 00:59:32.611]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:59:32.811 --> 00:59:36.313]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:59:36.333 --> 00:59:39.315]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[01:00:16.246 --> 01:00:16.886]  Big Brother.
[01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:18.588]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:19.328 --> 01:00:20.429]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:21.089 --> 01:00:21.890]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.671 --> 01:00:23.551]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:24.212 --> 01:00:27.854]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.415 --> 01:00:32.517]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.098 --> 01:00:37.501]  Well, the federal police are out looking for our reporters, going to their hotel.
[01:00:37.621 --> 01:00:40.063]  Our reporters are about to go look for them.
[01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:44.606]  They can call in with audio, video, we're not sure which connection they'll be able to have at any moment.
[01:00:46.465 --> 01:00:48.386]  I have not gotten into the other news.
[01:00:48.526 --> 01:00:50.466]  I want to cover some of that in the meantime.
[01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:53.147]  We start the next segment.
[01:00:54.388 --> 01:00:56.768]  John Bounds filed another excellent report.
[01:00:57.549 --> 01:00:58.989]  The TPP is unraveling.
[01:01:00.469 --> 01:01:01.650]  Very exciting intel.
[01:01:04.059 --> 01:01:08.142]  And that ties into the hundreds of articles that go back over the last few years.
[01:01:08.662 --> 01:01:09.543]  Everything is rigged.
[01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:11.184]  The biggest price-fixing scandal ever.
[01:01:11.584 --> 01:01:12.265]  Rolling Stone.
[01:01:12.825 --> 01:01:13.906]  This is who Bilderberg is.
[01:01:15.187 --> 01:01:16.007]  London Telegraph.
[01:01:16.467 --> 01:01:21.211]  Deutsche Bank hit with largest LIBOR fine in history for fixing interest rates.
[01:01:21.671 --> 01:01:23.112]  And then the newest one from two weeks ago.
[01:01:24.713 --> 01:01:28.656]  Six banks pay $5.8 billion, five guilty of market rigging.
[01:01:29.585 --> 01:01:38.132]  But nobody gets in criminal trouble, and $5.8 billion is not even what they make in a day, globally, manipulating the world currency rates.
[01:01:39.332 --> 01:01:40.714]  That's world currency manipulation.
[01:01:41.074 --> 01:01:48.680]  The interest rates, the stock market, the currency markets, the bond markets, it's all as rigged as a $3 bill.
[01:01:50.381 --> 01:01:57.947]  And these people have stolen tens of trillions, to the point of, they have police departments around the world acting like they're toadies.
[01:01:59.343 --> 01:02:01.924]  But they should all be in jail like Bernie Madoff or Ken Lay.
[01:02:05.726 --> 01:02:07.186]  We've got their agenda, by the way.
[01:02:07.246 --> 01:02:10.247]  In fact, will you reprint me the agenda we got the drudge linked to yesterday?
[01:02:10.267 --> 01:02:15.550]  I forgot to go over their actual front agenda, but there are other agendas there at play as well.
[01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:18.431]  Paul Watson gets in Wednesday.
[01:02:18.611 --> 01:02:26.034]  He's reporting just across the ocean, across the English Channel from London.
[01:02:30.003 --> 01:02:31.844]  So he'll be there on the ground.
[01:02:31.864 --> 01:02:34.845]  He's reporting also at InfoWars.com.
[01:02:34.865 --> 01:02:40.808]  But if you go to InfoWars.com, you can find all the numbers to the state police, the federal police, and others.
[01:02:40.828 --> 01:02:50.973]  And I think folks should also, something you can do is, the day Bilderberg starts arriving and the second day, you can just call the hotel and ask for people's rooms or ask by name.
[01:02:51.634 --> 01:02:56.136]  And one morning, it was 6 a.m., my hotel phone rings.
[01:02:56.596 --> 01:02:58.457]  I'm about 8 miles from Bilderberg in Virginia.
[01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:02.123]  And this guy gets on and he goes, I'm hacker such and such.
[01:03:02.163 --> 01:03:03.784]  Turns out it was a well-known famous hacker.
[01:03:04.905 --> 01:03:05.906]  I go, how'd you find out where I'm staying?
[01:03:05.926 --> 01:03:06.707]  He goes, I have my ways.
[01:03:07.707 --> 01:03:08.668]  I'm never going to air this.
[01:03:08.728 --> 01:03:09.509]  It's too incredible.
[01:03:10.109 --> 01:03:11.550]  But I want you to hear what I just recorded.
[01:03:11.691 --> 01:03:17.375]  And he puts it on the line of him having like a two-minute conversation with David Rockefeller.
[01:03:19.056 --> 01:03:20.998]  His assistant gets on the phone at 6 a.m.
[01:03:21.038 --> 01:03:21.578]  He called me at 6 a.m.
[01:03:21.599 --> 01:03:22.359]  It was like 5.30.
[01:03:22.759 --> 01:03:24.201]  He wakes David Rockefeller up.
[01:03:25.411 --> 01:03:29.093]  David Rockefeller goes, excuse me, I'll be back in a moment.
[01:03:29.313 --> 01:03:30.574]  David Rockefeller, I know his voice.
[01:03:31.854 --> 01:03:32.995]  You hear like a toilet flush.
[01:03:33.795 --> 01:03:39.418]  David Rockefeller comes back in and has a discussion about, well, who is this?
[01:03:39.458 --> 01:03:42.360]  He's like, well, I mean, I'm such and such, I'm concerned about global government and all this.
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:47.902]  He's like, well, it's what's needed, actually, and we're working towards it.
[01:03:47.962 --> 01:03:48.983]  It's epic audio.
[01:03:49.463 --> 01:03:53.085]  And that hacker has got that audio and never released it.
[01:03:58.086 --> 01:04:10.015]  By the way, you know the Free Syrian Army, the electronic Syrian Army that counters the Al Qaeda, ISIS, Salafist Army, is really just made up of a whole bunch of people.
[01:04:11.336 --> 01:04:14.258]  But the word is, it's actually folks inside the U.S.
[01:04:14.298 --> 01:04:15.359]  military and NATO.
[01:04:16.039 --> 01:04:20.283]  You've already heard some of those folks on air saying the whole thing's a criminal operation to arm Al Qaeda.
[01:04:20.303 --> 01:04:22.144]  That's now breaking big in the news.
[01:04:22.945 --> 01:04:25.887]  Again, devastating victory for freedom.
[01:04:28.558 --> 01:04:44.753]  But now they have hacked army.mil and other major sites and just put the message up there, don't fight for Al-Qaeda, ISIS is Al-Qaeda, your government's funding it, right as that hit newspapers all over the world.
[01:04:44.833 --> 01:04:48.156]  I mean, this is a devastating victory again against the globalists.
[01:04:49.690 --> 01:04:59.655]  To go into stable, democratizing countries, or to go into our ally Egypt, overthrow it, and then put headchoppers in charge to blow up every church in the country.
[01:05:00.075 --> 01:05:02.457]  I mean, that ought to tell you something about who's running the show, folks.
[01:05:02.957 --> 01:05:07.179]  And it's got our military really, really waking up.
[01:05:07.339 --> 01:05:08.320]  So good job, globalists.
[01:05:10.245 --> 01:05:20.692]  Former DARPA Director and now Google Executive Regina Dugan will be attending the secretive 2015 Bilderberg Conference this year in Austria.
[01:05:20.953 --> 01:05:29.659]  Dugan, who is helping to develop and promote the idea of implantable microchips, will be there to head up the discussion on artificial intelligence.
[01:05:30.139 --> 01:05:34.262]  Regina Dugan is also an advocate for ingestible microchips.
[01:05:34.562 --> 01:05:37.885]  That's right, tiny microchips inside little pills.
[01:05:38.405 --> 01:05:44.669]  That users would swallow daily in order to obtain what Dugan describes as superpowers.
[01:05:45.069 --> 01:05:54.155]  By having your entire body act as a biological authentication system for cell phones, cars, door locks, and other devices.
[01:05:54.796 --> 01:06:00.739]  And she is quick to point out that these microchip pills have already been approved by the FDA.
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:07.224]  For the complete list of this year's Bilderberg attendees, be sure to check out InfoWars.com.
[01:06:09.907 --> 01:06:14.910]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:20.913]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:06:21.153 --> 01:06:25.715]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:06:25.935 --> 01:06:29.237]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[01:06:39.742 --> 01:06:40.363]  Alex Jones here.
[01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:49.809]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:53.571]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[01:06:53.832 --> 01:07:01.837]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.

[01:07:04.779 --> 01:07:05.519]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:09.702 --> 01:07:14.443]  Alex Jones here with an InfoWarsLive.com consumer alert report.
[01:07:14.863 --> 01:07:21.905]  Many of you are aware that around the world most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[01:07:22.185 --> 01:07:29.947]  The good news is our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[01:07:30.267 --> 01:07:31.247]  The bad news is
[01:07:31.607 --> 01:07:38.869]  For the first time in more than a year, supplies at Infowarslife.com of Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine are running low.
[01:07:39.269 --> 01:07:43.671]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these Deep Earth Crystals.
[01:07:44.071 --> 01:07:51.233]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary and only available to Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:51.433 --> 01:07:54.334]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[01:07:54.554 --> 01:08:01.259]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[01:08:01.539 --> 01:08:07.524]  Available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:08:07.804 --> 01:08:14.850]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:18.132]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:20.104 --> 01:08:22.586]  We've got a huge second hour lined up for you.
[01:08:23.046 --> 01:08:43.558]  Anytime now, our reporters Rob Dew and Josh Owens reporting from Austria and Bilderberg, 2015, may be calling either by phone or video Skype as they go look for the federal police that have showed up at their hotel when they were gone, wanting to know about their YouTube videos and wanting to talk to them and were basically upset.
[01:08:44.559 --> 01:08:46.240]  They've gone through checkpoints, you name it.
[01:08:47.136 --> 01:08:48.257]  So look for that to happen.
[01:08:49.397 --> 01:08:50.058]  Ex-U.S.
[01:08:50.118 --> 01:08:54.420]  intelligence officials confirm secret Pentagon report proves U.S.
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:56.781]  complicity in creation of ISIS.
[01:08:56.821 --> 01:08:57.942]  That's from Zero Hedge.
[01:08:58.382 --> 01:09:00.203]  According to newly declassified U.S.
[01:09:00.243 --> 01:09:03.965]  document, the Pentagon foresaw the likely rise of the Islamic State.
[01:09:04.725 --> 01:09:07.627]  That's something they released after it got leaked that they're running it.
[01:09:09.428 --> 01:09:15.451]  Oh, we've got to take your rights because al-Qaeda might attack you when they're running it.
[01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:16.512]  That's what ISIS is.
[01:09:19.167 --> 01:09:23.009]  Report, Pfizer hid link between antidepressants and birth defects.
[01:09:23.509 --> 01:09:26.431]  Just like they hid the link to mass murder and suicide.
[01:09:27.752 --> 01:09:34.656]  G7 Summit, President Assad could face exile in Russia and the West plan to tackle ISIS in Syria.
[01:09:34.976 --> 01:09:40.619]  That's their excuse to occupy Syria after they take Assad out, is to take out ISIS they put in charge.
[01:09:40.979 --> 01:09:45.482]  Then ISIS will be given part of Syria and part of Iraq as the original payoff plan.
[01:09:47.136 --> 01:09:51.099]  That's why the military admits they're not allowed to bomb any real ISIS vehicles.
[01:09:51.139 --> 01:09:58.105]  They're given, once a week or so, a brick building to bomb, just to make it look like they're actually fighting them.
[01:09:59.627 --> 01:10:01.228]  Truly, truly sick.
[01:10:01.348 --> 01:10:06.693]  So they've gone from openly backing them two years ago, to randomly bombing a few buildings, just for the news media.
[01:10:08.254 --> 01:10:15.220]  I want to get to this report, TPP, the unraveling begins, and then after that, simply amazing parallel.
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:17.920]  That Richard pointed out to me this morning.
[01:10:21.602 --> 01:10:32.205]  We have these two New York inmates that have basically broken out over the weekend.
[01:10:32.245 --> 01:10:33.725]  It's one of the top stories in the country.
[01:10:34.186 --> 01:10:35.926]  Oh, it's so horrible that they've gotten out.
[01:10:37.447 --> 01:10:38.967]  Oh, we're all in so much danger.
[01:10:38.987 --> 01:10:40.267]  One of them killed a sheriff's deputy.
[01:10:40.307 --> 01:10:41.668]  The other one beat somebody to death.
[01:10:43.018 --> 01:10:44.319]  It's clearly an inside job.
[01:10:44.899 --> 01:10:45.700]  Search for killers.
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:47.901]  Clues after brazen New York prison escape.
[01:10:50.723 --> 01:10:56.266]  Well that ties into the tens of thousands per month of illegals being released.
[01:10:56.707 --> 01:11:05.432]  Thousands of them convicted of aggravated crimes including rape, assault, arson, bank robbery.
[01:11:05.592 --> 01:11:06.753]  I mean you can't, again,
[01:11:09.316 --> 01:11:10.916]  Where's all the freaking out about that?
[01:11:11.016 --> 01:11:12.877]  Again, I'm not even against the illegals.
[01:11:13.198 --> 01:11:15.219]  They're just people fleeing collapsing countries.
[01:11:15.279 --> 01:11:15.659]  I get it.
[01:11:16.139 --> 01:11:23.763]  I'm against how they get off without fines, they get to drunk drive, do everything else, commit felonies.
[01:11:23.783 --> 01:11:25.143]  Remember the railway killer?
[01:11:25.163 --> 01:11:26.204]  Mainly preyed on Hispanics.
[01:11:26.524 --> 01:11:28.225]  That's another thing, is they mainly prey on Hispanics.
[01:11:28.585 --> 01:11:29.265]  They can get away with it.
[01:11:31.366 --> 01:11:33.367]  And on the immigrant community, that's usually what gangs do.
[01:11:33.668 --> 01:11:34.328]  First generation.
[01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:45.192]  The big point here is that the railway killer killed like, was it more than 15 people or something?
[01:11:45.432 --> 01:11:49.253]  He'd rape them and kill them, and they could never keep him in jail because he had a fake name.
[01:11:50.754 --> 01:11:53.395]  He'd get put in jail, released, put in jail, released for other crimes.
[01:11:53.655 --> 01:11:58.536]  He just went around crime spreeing everywhere, and we're told just ignore it, but oh my gosh!
[01:11:59.236 --> 01:12:00.917]  Oh my gosh, we've got criminals!
[01:12:03.097 --> 01:12:04.578]  Two of them that escaped to New York.
[01:12:04.978 --> 01:12:05.778]  Everybody's dead.
[01:12:05.818 --> 01:12:06.459]  It's all over.
[01:12:06.519 --> 01:12:07.339]  Run for the hills.
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:12.381]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go to this report.
[01:12:12.421 --> 01:12:13.262]  Some good news.
[01:12:13.962 --> 01:12:16.723]  TPP, the unraveling begins.
[01:12:17.384 --> 01:12:21.666]  TPP will hand huge corporations the power to change U.S.
[01:12:21.726 --> 01:12:27.088]  laws at will, but more and more people, prominent people, are speaking out against it.
[01:12:27.408 --> 01:12:29.409]  Leading the charge is Senator Rand Paul.
[01:12:29.729 --> 01:12:30.710]  Here's John Bowne's report.
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:47.508]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership trade package is beginning to unravel, with more prominent voices slamming President Obama and the Republican leadership over the secretive deal that threatens to cost American jobs and hand big corporations new powers that would violate national sovereignty.
[01:12:47.748 --> 01:13:05.465]  House Majority Whip Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Rules Committee Chairman Representative Pete Sessions of Texas refused to reveal to Breitbart whether they had read the TPP agreement but still said they would support the Trade Promotion Authority and allow President Barack Obama to fast-track the TPP.
[01:13:06.025 --> 01:13:13.692]  Lawmakers claim that TPA is separate from TPP and that they will review the final TPP agreement before it is considered by Congress.
[01:13:13.972 --> 01:13:17.895]  However, as Matthew Boyle explains, this explanation doesn't wash.
[01:13:18.156 --> 01:13:26.603]  A vote for the TPA is a de facto green light for the TPP since there is essentially no way to halt a trade deal once it has been fast-tracked.
[01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:35.367]  Boyle writes, since Fast Track was created in the Richard Nixon administration, not one trade deal that started on Fast Track has been forwarded.
[01:13:35.687 --> 01:13:44.451]  As such, a vote for TPA is a vote for TPP, since passing TPA will all but guarantee the successful passage of TPP.
[01:13:44.591 --> 01:13:52.515]  Senator Marco Rubio, Senator Lindsey Graham, and Representative John Boehner are also refusing to reveal if they visited the secret room
[01:13:53.175 --> 01:13:58.616]  To read the controversial TPP document, although all three are set to vote for the TPA.
[01:13:59.116 --> 01:14:08.199]  Daniel Horowitz, Senior Editor of the Conservative Review writes, Passing a bill in order to find out what's in it is what placed the Pelosi Congress in the ash heap of history.
[01:14:08.219 --> 01:14:09.979]  It's not an auspicious path for ambitious politicians.
[01:14:22.222 --> 01:14:33.504]  The Washington Post reports the push from the President included direct calls to lawmakers, interviews with television stations in key states, and plans to bring several Democrats aboard Air Force One with him.
[01:14:33.825 --> 01:14:43.247]  Meanwhile, despite claims that climate change mandates would not be a part of TPP, President Obama admitted during an NPR interview on Wednesday that this would indeed be the case.
[01:14:43.547 --> 01:14:49.868]  By passing such mandates via the TPP, Obama could sneak through draconian climate regulations under the radar.
[01:14:50.248 --> 01:14:50.768]  We're good to go.
[01:15:08.656 --> 01:15:15.663]  Howard Richman writes, Obama would not need to get Congress to approve the unfair climate change treaty terms that he negotiates.
[01:15:16.143 --> 01:15:23.590]  Instead, he could get the commission set up by the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement to add those terms to the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:34.299]  After that, the investor state dispute settlement provisions set up by that agreement could enforce Obama's terms through the threat of multi-billion dollar fines upon the U.S.
[01:15:34.359 --> 01:15:34.800]  government.
[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:39.725]  Physicians are rallying as they become increasingly concerned about the passage of TPP.
[01:15:40.066 --> 01:15:49.456]  Prescription drug costs could waylay the affordability of biologics and thousands of prescription drugs by drastically altering intellectual property protections.
[01:15:49.957 --> 01:15:50.818]  We're good to go.
[01:16:08.739 --> 01:16:16.862]  Most recently, the World Trade Organization Tribunal ruled against the United States in a NAFTA suit brought by Canada and Mexico that claimed the U.S.
[01:16:16.902 --> 01:16:23.944]  country of origin labeling law, which requires foreign meat to be labeled as such, is an unfair and illegal trade practice.
[01:16:24.144 --> 01:16:31.247]  The WTO's May 18th ruling was the fourth time in three years that the global court had ruled against COOL.
[01:16:31.687 --> 01:16:32.447]  Even though U.S.
[01:16:32.507 --> 01:16:38.988]  courts have ruled that COOL is legal, faced with WTO penalties and threats of retaliation, the U.S.
[01:16:39.028 --> 01:16:49.030]  Congress is now considering repeal of COOL, and American consumers may soon lose the ability to discover if the meat at the grocery store or restaurant is U.S.
[01:16:49.150 --> 01:16:51.490]  raised or from Mexico, Brazil, or China.
[01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:59.772]  Critics of the TPP assert that the trade deal will cost American jobs and give huge corporations the power to change U.S.
[01:16:59.852 --> 01:17:00.172]  laws.
[01:17:00.872 --> 01:17:02.994]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[01:17:04.216 --> 01:17:06.018]  And that's why Bilderberg is important.
[01:17:06.118 --> 01:17:09.221]  It is the progenitor of the granddaddy of all of this.
[01:17:11.583 --> 01:17:22.254]  Meanwhile, they're pushing for borders to be open across the planet and we have Richard Matt and David Sweat who escaped this weekend from a
[01:17:23.942 --> 01:17:25.903]  Maximum security prison in New York.
[01:17:26.403 --> 01:17:31.084]  You've got the governor running around grandstanding like it's the end of the world.
[01:17:31.705 --> 01:17:39.387]  You've got checkpoints, guys with machine guns running around looking for them, saying, look out public, oh it's so dangerous.
[01:17:39.507 --> 01:17:40.788]  And I mean, I hope they catch the guys.
[01:17:40.828 --> 01:17:49.551]  The point is, hundreds of thousands of illegals are released every year, tens of thousands, with
[01:17:51.053 --> 01:17:53.835]  Serious felonies, many of which haven't even served time.
[01:17:54.255 --> 01:18:03.520]  They just have the convictions in Mexico or the U.S., break out, get out, or are released, and then they're picked back up and are released again.
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:08.442]  ICE Director struggles to explain release of thousands of criminal immigrants.
[01:18:10.223 --> 01:18:15.146]  Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Sarah Saladinas
[01:18:16.983 --> 01:18:27.568]  Saldana, thank you for helping me guys, struggled to explain the reasons behind the Obama administration's release of thousands of criminal immigrants when pressed by Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas.
[01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:33.271]  In the fiscal year of 2014, ICE released 30,558 convicted criminal immigrants.
[01:18:33.291 --> 01:18:33.852]  Did you hear that?
[01:18:33.872 --> 01:18:34.632]  30,000 plus!
[01:18:42.509 --> 01:18:48.131]  Convicted of 79,059 crimes, allowing them to walk free in the U.S.
[01:18:49.091 --> 01:18:52.632]  And folks, we're talking about everything you can imagine.
[01:18:55.853 --> 01:19:01.555]  But then two guys get out, and it just shows how controlled the media is.
[01:19:03.655 --> 01:19:04.456]  Any U.S.
[01:19:04.516 --> 01:19:09.017]  newspaper that reported on Bilderberg, it's newsworthy, it's pertinent,
[01:19:09.972 --> 01:19:11.012]  Drugs would link to it.
[01:19:11.693 --> 01:19:12.873]  It'd be one of the top stories.
[01:19:13.753 --> 01:19:15.094]  It would cause a national debate.
[01:19:15.574 --> 01:19:17.735]  You'd win a Pulitzer Prize, because you're the mainstream media.
[01:19:17.775 --> 01:19:21.416]  If you did it, you'd get a Pulitzer Prize, not the people that worked on it for 40 years.
[01:19:22.096 --> 01:19:24.957]  And I think that's fair, because you're the mainstream media and you're God.
[01:19:25.257 --> 01:19:26.038]  Well, not anymore.
[01:19:26.738 --> 01:19:29.699]  But see, they won't do it because they're controlled.
[01:19:30.519 --> 01:19:34.921]  And they know it's a, quote, career killer to report on the real shadow government.
[01:19:35.725 --> 01:19:40.030]  But it's already a career killer because the globalists are shutting down the old media.
[01:19:40.331 --> 01:19:41.432]  They don't want any media.
[01:19:41.973 --> 01:19:43.975]  And they're coming after the free independent press.
[01:19:45.076 --> 01:19:46.758]  So why have you destroyed yourselves?
[01:19:46.919 --> 01:19:48.641]  Why won't you report on it?
[01:19:49.422 --> 01:19:55.129]  Once Bilderberg kicks off officially on Thursday, there'll be some cheeky, snarky, joke articles.
[01:19:56.863 --> 01:20:06.648]  Or if I talk about China getting caught selling babies in gold foil and make a joke, hey I bet you're eating that inside Bilderberg, they'll all run with that and say that I was serious.
[01:20:07.588 --> 01:20:08.609]  And then make a joke out of it.
[01:20:10.603 --> 01:20:12.664]  So the phone rings, and I pick it up, and it's Mark.
[01:20:12.724 --> 01:20:18.025]  And Mark says to me, hey, third Sunday, June, Father's Day, I ordered Dad a gun.
[01:20:18.085 --> 01:20:18.585]  It's here.
[01:20:18.965 --> 01:20:21.706]  He's going to build it out, and we're going to go out on Father's Day shooting.
[01:20:21.726 --> 01:20:22.326]  You want to come?
[01:20:22.346 --> 01:20:23.086]  And I said, yeah.
[01:20:23.287 --> 01:20:28.048]  What a great idea for a Father's Day gift, an AR-15 rifle kit from Guns80.com.
[01:20:28.108 --> 01:20:29.128]  I think I'll get my dad one.
[01:20:29.148 --> 01:20:29.828]  He says, go ahead.
[01:20:30.108 --> 01:20:30.849]  See you out on the range.
[01:20:30.869 --> 01:20:32.469]  So we're going to meet on the range on Father's Day.
[01:20:32.769 --> 01:20:36.230]  Get your dad an AR-15 rifle kit at Guns80.com, Guns80.com, or call 844-2GUNS80.

[01:22:09.344 --> 01:22:11.045]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:22:11.265 --> 01:22:14.607]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:22:14.907 --> 01:22:15.888]  A pair of scissors.
[01:22:16.268 --> 01:22:21.771]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[01:22:22.051 --> 01:22:26.733]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[01:22:26.974 --> 01:22:27.794]  The phone line.
[01:22:27.974 --> 01:22:32.897]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:22:33.217 --> 01:22:36.959]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:22:37.119 --> 01:22:40.022]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.

[01:24:26.532 --> 01:24:27.093]  Here we are.
[01:24:27.153 --> 01:24:32.617]  What's the crime of being reporters from the Alps in Austria, Bilderberg, 2015?
[01:24:33.858 --> 01:24:36.239]  Let me plow into other news right now.
[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:39.142]  This story's up on RT.com.
[01:24:40.643 --> 01:24:43.465]  It's also mirrored at Infowars.com.
[01:24:44.506 --> 01:24:46.007]  Droning on forever.
[01:24:47.065 --> 01:24:52.507]  Boeing patents UAV that could fly indefinitely, recharging in midair.
[01:24:53.988 --> 01:25:00.971]  Electricity-powered drone would have a rechargeable tether cable that would connect to a power source.
[01:25:02.492 --> 01:25:09.595]  So the drone would fly up, lower its light cable down, and then fly in circles, basically, while it's powering back up.
[01:25:11.047 --> 01:25:15.109]  As drone technologies continue to advance, Boeing has raised the bar even higher.
[01:25:15.689 --> 01:25:23.452]  The aerospace giant has received a patent for a UAV that can fly forever, recharging in midair via a tether attached to the ground.
[01:25:26.833 --> 01:25:32.155]  I saw Alexander Haig back in like 1992 when he had a TV show nationwide on cable.
[01:25:35.814 --> 01:25:47.220]  Where he had a company that was going to have blimps over every major city, but at about 100,000 feet, that had solar panels on the top that would then run telecommunications, cell towers, but also spy on people.
[01:25:47.941 --> 01:25:48.941]  His word was security.
[01:25:50.102 --> 01:25:51.623]  And now, of course, they're launching those.
[01:25:51.683 --> 01:25:56.786]  I mean, they launched them a long time ago, but only in certain cities like D.C., New York.
[01:25:56.806 --> 01:25:58.867]  Salt Lake City, for some reason, had one.
[01:25:59.487 --> 01:26:00.308]  Dallas had one.
[01:26:01.852 --> 01:26:05.234]  And I can play you the ABC newscast and a CBS one.
[01:26:05.614 --> 01:26:09.516]  You can go to YouTube and type in mystery UFO over Salt Lake.
[01:26:10.057 --> 01:26:13.519]  And it's a giant blimp bigger than the Hindenburg.
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.000]  Looks like the Hindenburg.
[01:26:16.541 --> 01:26:17.941]  And it's got propellers on it.
[01:26:21.744 --> 01:26:24.165]  And it's a government blimp.
[01:26:24.825 --> 01:26:25.726]  We even know the model.
[01:26:27.387 --> 01:26:29.308]  And instead they told the public it was an alien.
[01:26:32.708 --> 01:26:33.889]  They said, is it aliens?
[01:26:34.989 --> 01:26:36.891]  I mean, that's how they treat the public, so stupid.
[01:26:37.131 --> 01:26:37.791]  It's a blimp.
[01:26:38.232 --> 01:26:40.053]  Hundred plus year old technology.
[01:26:40.453 --> 01:26:43.155]  In fact, the French had hot air balloons 400 years ago.
[01:26:43.775 --> 01:26:46.737]  And the Italians, they debate who invented it, the French or the Italians.
[01:26:46.997 --> 01:26:47.718]  Probably the Italians.
[01:26:50.299 --> 01:26:53.822]  They've had hot air balloons for 400 plus years.
[01:26:53.862 --> 01:26:58.325]  They've had, well, thousands if you count the Chinese launching lanterns.
[01:27:01.109 --> 01:27:02.990]  Hot air balloons that carry people for 400 years.
[01:27:03.291 --> 01:27:07.794]  And we've had dirigibles for over 115 years or so.
[01:27:08.414 --> 01:27:09.355]  Or longer, actually.
[01:27:11.916 --> 01:27:16.279]  And the public thinks it's a flying saucer.
[01:27:18.501 --> 01:27:21.883]  Because they couldn't be educated on surveillance blimps.
[01:27:22.323 --> 01:27:23.684]  Instead, they think it's an alien.
[01:27:23.704 --> 01:27:25.586]  I mean, that's what's so frustrating about this.
[01:27:28.087 --> 01:27:30.149]  And they've got conservative talk show hosts
[01:27:31.715 --> 01:27:41.019]  That will get up on television and the radio and attack this show and say there's no FEMA camps, there's no COG, there's no NSA.
[01:27:41.039 --> 01:27:49.742]  Now they've changed their tune since then, but back when they were doing that four or five years ago saying I was a liar, I knew people that worked in their offices.
[01:27:50.743 --> 01:27:56.005]  And they said no, they know it's real, we're giving them all the documents, they just have been told to do this.
[01:27:57.842 --> 01:28:06.465]  Imagine knowing they've got FEMA camps, knowing they're preparing for all this, and then you get up there and you lie because you're scared of the government.
[01:28:07.085 --> 01:28:10.786]  You ought to be scared of not saying something and not doing something.
[01:28:11.307 --> 01:28:13.767]  By the way, they found the ABC News piece out of Salt Lake.
[01:28:14.748 --> 01:28:21.390]  It's a giant silver blimp with rudders and tail fins.
[01:28:24.611 --> 01:28:25.551]  That's a naval blimp.
[01:28:25.871 --> 01:28:26.592]  I know that model.
[01:28:26.612 --> 01:28:27.172]  You can look it up.
[01:28:29.713 --> 01:28:34.399]  Up there surveilling people, and everybody thinks it's a UFO.
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:36.062]  In fact, can we rewind that and play the audio?
[01:28:37.363 --> 01:28:37.684]  Thanks.
[01:28:40.147 --> 01:28:41.189]  This is my frustration.
[01:28:43.372 --> 01:28:44.053]  Here, go ahead and roll it.
[01:28:44.093 --> 01:28:44.253]  Thanks.
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:52.521]  What's hovering over Salt Lake City?
[01:28:52.621 --> 01:28:53.322]  Is it a rocket?
[01:28:53.342 --> 01:28:53.822]  A blimp?
[01:28:53.942 --> 01:28:54.763]  A UFO?
[01:28:55.544 --> 01:28:59.506]  A strange object seen in the skies has residents scratching their heads.
[01:28:59.967 --> 01:29:03.710]  The craft floated overhead for several minutes before disappearing.
[01:29:04.270 --> 01:29:09.814]  Salt Lake air traffic controllers said their radar didn't pick up anything and they have no knowledge of the craft.
[01:29:10.855 --> 01:29:12.476]  That's because they were told the lie.
[01:29:12.516 --> 01:29:14.037]  That's a shorter version of the report.
[01:29:14.658 --> 01:29:15.438]  There's a whole bunch of them.
[01:29:15.458 --> 01:29:17.379]  They go into saying, no, it must be aliens.
[01:29:18.328 --> 01:29:25.937]  It must be flying saucers because they don't want to tell you the feds have a giant blimp up there with ground penetrating radar, snoop systems.
[01:29:25.977 --> 01:29:33.106]  I mean, I told people 20 years ago about the FBI Cessnas and the Department of Energy and the EPA.
[01:29:33.126 --> 01:29:33.867]  They've all got them.
[01:29:34.348 --> 01:29:37.812]  But I knew because in East Texas, I knew folks that worked on them.
[01:29:39.161 --> 01:29:41.243]  And they said, oh yeah, they're out looking for marijuana fields.
[01:29:42.183 --> 01:29:48.208]  They fly over the power plants to check to see if they're fudging their sensors that no toxic waste is coming out of the towers.
[01:29:48.688 --> 01:29:50.549]  But we're told to tell people that they're not government.
[01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:53.051]  Well, see, all that was released last week.
[01:29:53.491 --> 01:29:58.355]  So you can hear it here 20 years ago, or you can hear it, you know, now from the establishment.
[01:29:59.616 --> 01:30:00.517]  We're on the march.
[01:30:01.017 --> 01:30:02.618]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.539 --> 01:30:06.221]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:11.138 --> 01:30:17.483]  Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but back in my day, a school field trip consisted of a sack lunch and a trip to the zoo.
[01:30:17.823 --> 01:30:23.827]  But now they've upped the ante in places like Minneapolis, where a private school is taking their kids to a sex shop.
[01:30:24.267 --> 01:30:24.768]  That's right.
[01:30:25.168 --> 01:30:33.414]  Multiple news outlets are reporting that parents are demanding school chiefs' removal after she took a group to the Smitten Kitten for sex education class.
[01:30:33.734 --> 01:30:39.278]  And as you might imagine, a place like the Smitten Kitten has several objects that you won't find in gym class.
[01:30:39.918 --> 01:30:44.201]  And while the school has not been available for direct comment, they did issue a statement.
[01:30:44.221 --> 01:30:49.264]  Some parents, like Steven Straw Matt, are mad as hell and have already removed their children from the school.
[01:30:49.284 --> 01:30:51.486]  You can find more reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[01:31:10.425 --> 01:31:17.392]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[01:33:16.889 --> 01:33:17.709]  London Dungeon?
[01:33:18.590 --> 01:33:23.772]  How about Austrian Dungeon?
[01:33:23.912 --> 01:33:26.032]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:26.513 --> 01:33:31.374]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:33:31.535 --> 01:33:36.236]  I don't wanna be in your London Dungeon.
[01:33:36.516 --> 01:33:42.899]  I don't wanna be in your... I don't wanna be in your... Your British Hell.
[01:33:49.429 --> 01:33:59.115]  Report!
[01:34:02.117 --> 01:34:02.597]  Report!
[01:34:02.617 --> 01:34:06.339]  Pfizer hid link between antidepressants and birth defects.
[01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:10.402]  Pharmacological mammoth Pfizer faces more than a thousand lawsuits.
[01:34:10.442 --> 01:34:11.422]  We're going to hit that in a moment.
[01:34:13.824 --> 01:34:15.005]  I want to get into
[01:34:16.929 --> 01:34:24.233]  The latest on Bilderberg and a whole other grouping of news about election 2016 here in this republic.
[01:34:26.974 --> 01:34:40.320]  But before we do that, I wanted to just mention that Joe Biggs earlier was showing me magazine articles and newspaper articles out of Austria and then U.S.
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:43.642]  stories about them concerning Cobra commandos
[01:34:45.293 --> 01:34:46.113]  No, it's not a G.I.
[01:34:46.133 --> 01:34:46.734]  Joe show.
[01:34:46.854 --> 01:35:01.579]  It's a real security group that is running security and I guess in charge of the 2,000 federal and state police paid for by taxpayers to guard the Bilderberg group meeting the New York Times says does not exist.
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:08.221]  You can pull up a article out of the New York Times.
[01:35:09.081 --> 01:35:11.142]  It's a film review of the film New World Order.
[01:35:12.756 --> 01:35:27.083]  That came out in 2009, a year after Bilderberg, 2008, in Chantilly, Virginia, and they actually say that I'm in a hotel parking lot having a full-on hallucination of Blackstand Secret Service and world leaders.
[01:35:27.103 --> 01:35:30.125]  That they just said that you see Jones imagining things.
[01:35:31.726 --> 01:35:32.046]  That's right!
[01:35:33.328 --> 01:35:33.988]  None of this is real!
[01:35:34.248 --> 01:35:44.891]  The show isn't real, Obamacare's not real, nobody's coming after your guns, nobody got rid of the borders, nobody's jacking up your taxes, government loves you, government's perfect, everything's fine.
[01:35:48.752 --> 01:36:00.155]  So I asked Joe to get these articles together, maybe scan them, or give the files to the crew, so that
[01:36:03.186 --> 01:36:16.337]  We can show TV viewers just how amazing this is that Bilderberg has this paramilitary group running around protecting it from the evil press.
[01:36:16.998 --> 01:36:18.539]  All, again, taxpayer paid for.
[01:36:20.821 --> 01:36:29.248]  Briefly, before I get into Pfizer and how they hid the link between antidepressants and birth defects,
[01:36:31.445 --> 01:36:40.511]  And before I get back into the fact that everyone's freaking out, the media's freaking out about two escaped killers from New York State Prison.
[01:36:43.072 --> 01:36:51.197]  The 30 plus thousand illegals that have been released that have felony criminal backgrounds.
[01:36:53.579 --> 01:36:57.181]  We have some congressional testimony dealing with that and more.
[01:36:58.882 --> 01:36:59.503]  But briefly,
[01:37:00.646 --> 01:37:14.315]  We sold out of survival shield nascent iodine X2, the deep earth crystal source that's so pure and that folks have had such rave reviews about because everybody knows there's a massive iodine deficiency out there in the soil and in the food.
[01:37:15.056 --> 01:37:18.598]  That's why seafood is so important because it has a lot of iodine, has a lot of toxins as well.
[01:37:19.119 --> 01:37:22.001]  So the best place to get it is deep earth pure source.
[01:37:23.161 --> 01:37:25.183]  Well, no one else we know of has ever done that.
[01:37:26.636 --> 01:37:27.137]  We have.
[01:37:27.899 --> 01:37:30.666]  The problem is we secured some two years ago.
[01:37:31.807 --> 01:37:33.547]  And basically it's run out.
[01:37:34.088 --> 01:37:36.568]  And now we're having to secure more and that may take some time.
[01:37:36.608 --> 01:37:37.808]  So we're sold out right now.
[01:37:38.209 --> 01:37:39.989]  We have a small amount of the iodine left.
[01:37:40.369 --> 01:37:42.650]  The crystals, that has been basically manufactured.
[01:37:42.670 --> 01:37:47.051]  But now it's got to be put in the bottles and then shipped from the laboratory here in the U.S.
[01:37:47.391 --> 01:37:48.311]  to our shipping facility.
[01:37:48.351 --> 01:37:51.932]  But we're going to be out for a while of Survival Shield Nixon Iodine X2.
[01:37:52.392 --> 01:37:54.132]  We do have the original Survival Shield.
[01:37:54.432 --> 01:37:55.593]  It's from a kelp source.
[01:37:56.173 --> 01:37:58.173]  The cleanest out there after X2.
[01:37:58.593 --> 01:38:00.354]  Super high quality, but not as strong.
[01:38:01.806 --> 01:38:03.187]  That's what I tend to give my children.
[01:38:03.747 --> 01:38:09.031]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:38:09.671 --> 01:38:15.095]  And secondarily, it's a win-win because your purchase supports the broadcast and what we're doing here.
[01:38:16.956 --> 01:38:30.565]  When you buy these products, it funds the whole operation so I can send three reporters to Austria to cover Bilderberg 2015 that no one else is doing.
[01:38:32.150 --> 01:38:32.390]  Yet.
[01:38:35.472 --> 01:38:38.793]  The big national newspapers in Europe will just report it's happening.
[01:38:40.354 --> 01:38:44.116]  And they've got a few pool photographers out there covering it.
[01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:46.641]  So we're filling that vacuum.
[01:38:46.661 --> 01:38:55.085]  We're filling that area that's not being basically dealt with by the prostitute, lapdog, drive-by media, to steal a word, a term from Rush Limbaugh.
[01:38:55.545 --> 01:39:00.027]  So, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:39:00.447 --> 01:39:07.890]  You go there, you can find high-quality water filters that cut out the glyphosates and fluoride and other deadly chemicals that are such a big problem and such an intricate disruptor.
[01:39:08.410 --> 01:39:09.191]  It cuts out the
[01:39:09.651 --> 01:39:15.917]  Serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the SSRIs, the anti-psychotics, all the stuff that's in major water supplies on record.
[01:39:16.338 --> 01:39:18.280]  Thousands of different things that are in the water.
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:19.881]  The water is impure.
[01:39:20.582 --> 01:39:26.448]  Our precious bodily fluids, to quote General Jack T. Ripper from Dr. Strangelove, have been compromised.
[01:39:26.808 --> 01:39:28.930]  How's that for your hardcore communist conspiracy?
[01:39:29.971 --> 01:39:30.772]  And I'm not joking.
[01:39:31.212 --> 01:39:33.994]  When you filter your water, it's a life changer.
[01:39:34.094 --> 01:39:39.758]  You do that with the Oxy-Powder tablets that flush out the upper and lower intestine at Infowarslife.com.
[01:39:41.199 --> 01:39:49.424]  The Original Survival Shield, the Super Male Vitality, the Super Female Vitality, the whole thing fused together has been life-changing for myself and so many others.
[01:39:49.744 --> 01:39:56.209]  And then you're also funding the Tip of the Spear, the True Trailblazers when it comes to just hardcore laying the facts out.
[01:39:57.324 --> 01:39:58.845]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:39:59.585 --> 01:40:21.055]  And there's so many other great products from Child Ease, to Secret 12, to Winter Sun, to DNA Force, to high-quality colloidal silver, Silver Bullet, to Ancient Defense, high-quality organic coffee, my favorite type, we've private labeled, out of southern Mexico, out of volcanic soil,
[01:40:22.219 --> 01:40:25.545]  Everything else is right here in the USA, but that's high quality stuff out of Mexico.
[01:40:25.925 --> 01:40:27.468]  I like to support the farmers down there.
[01:40:27.488 --> 01:40:27.528]  888-253-3139.
[01:40:27.548 --> 01:40:28.590]  888-253-3139.
[01:40:28.670 --> 01:40:29.030]  And really...
[01:40:36.175 --> 01:40:38.896]  One of the most important things to get if you haven't done it is Oxy-Powder.
[01:40:38.956 --> 01:40:41.157]  The way it flushes out the upper and lower intestine.
[01:40:42.338 --> 01:40:45.339]  Rob Dew lost 11 pounds in one week and he wasn't even a fat guy.
[01:40:45.359 --> 01:40:47.060]  It was just stuff in his intestines.
[01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:51.982]  Everybody I know that has taken this has been blown away and I mean that as a pun.
[01:40:53.042 --> 01:40:59.644]  This is not like hardcore herbs or toxic things or things that are really painful, things that are harsh.
[01:41:00.004 --> 01:41:10.388]  It's just time-released high-level oxygen that time releases in the upper and lower intestines and just flushes everything out that's been in there for years in some cases.
[01:41:10.968 --> 01:41:15.510]  Simply amazing what it does for your skin, for your health, for your digestion.
[01:41:16.250 --> 01:41:18.711]  The gut is under constant attack and
[01:41:19.804 --> 01:41:23.087]  Oxy-Powder developed by Dr. Group is used in Hollywood, you name it.
[01:41:23.487 --> 01:41:26.570]  It is fantastic.
[01:41:26.590 --> 01:41:32.536]  888-253-3139 or Infowarslife.com.
[01:41:32.716 --> 01:41:37.260]  Report Pfizer-Hid link between antidepressants and birth defects.
[01:41:39.122 --> 01:41:43.286]  Pharmaceutical mammoth Pfizer faces more than a thousand lawsuits.
[01:41:46.124 --> 01:41:52.128]  From victims who say the company knew about the relationship between Burt and Fex and their number one best-selling antidepressant.
[01:41:52.548 --> 01:41:54.529]  A claim that Pfizer has of course battled against.
[01:41:54.589 --> 01:42:00.553]  Now, however, new reports have surfaced that Pfizer's own scientific advisors were warned of the deadly link for more than a year.
[01:42:01.213 --> 01:42:06.756]  Something that my team told you in 2012 was already going on.
[01:42:06.776 --> 01:42:09.538]  This is Anthony Gucciardi reporting according to Bloomberg.
[01:42:10.859 --> 01:42:11.720]  At Pfizer Inc.
[01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:19.424]  report shows a scientist warned executives last year about a potential link between the antidepressant drug Zoloft and birth defects.
[01:42:20.385 --> 01:42:31.811]  I know someone who the doctor says got Virligo or whatever Michael Jackson had from Zoloft and recommended changes to the medication safety warning.
[01:42:32.231 --> 01:42:34.172]  Again, I kind of inserted that statement in the middle of that line.
[01:42:34.192 --> 01:42:34.913]  Let me just read that again.
[01:42:35.293 --> 01:42:36.154]  A Pfizer Inc.
[01:42:36.214 --> 01:42:36.594]  report
[01:42:37.970 --> 01:42:50.280]  This shows a scientist warned executives last year about a potential link between the antidepressant drug Zoloft and birth defects and recommended changes to the medication safety warning.
[01:42:50.300 --> 01:42:53.142]  The document from a Pfizer drug safety official.
[01:42:53.882 --> 01:42:55.583]  Here's what we know about serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[01:42:55.603 --> 01:42:57.464]  They're super toxic across the board.
[01:42:57.484 --> 01:42:59.225]  They're based in fluoride molecule.
[01:43:22.359 --> 01:43:25.221]  And they just have a laundry list of things they do to you.
[01:43:26.682 --> 01:43:27.942]  They're extremely toxic.
[01:43:29.643 --> 01:43:30.844]  They're extremely addictive.
[01:43:31.284 --> 01:43:32.725]  They're extremely psychoactive.
[01:43:32.765 --> 01:43:36.588]  They are in the hallucinogen class.
[01:43:37.608 --> 01:43:38.689]  They are hallucinogenic.
[01:43:40.690 --> 01:43:42.091]  They are psychotropic.
[01:43:43.071 --> 01:43:45.073]  And they also are linked to Alzheimer's.
[01:43:46.734 --> 01:43:48.154]  They're linked to diabetes.
[01:43:48.715 --> 01:43:50.396]  I mean, they're bad news.
[01:43:51.909 --> 01:43:53.690]  And they push them on everybody.
[01:43:55.351 --> 01:44:00.774]  There are more than 50 different types of serotonin reuptake inhibitors just in the United States.
[01:44:01.655 --> 01:44:03.516]  And they usually are stronger than the last one.
[01:44:05.797 --> 01:44:12.541]  The average foster child in America, 70 plus percent are on psychotropics, look it up, or antipsychotics.
[01:44:12.561 --> 01:44:14.362]  They're on mind-altering drugs.
[01:44:14.402 --> 01:44:15.002]  Either speed,
[01:44:16.818 --> 01:44:18.719]  Or antipsychotics or antidepressants.
[01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:28.026]  But 70 plus percent in national studies, look it up, are on a behavioral modification drug.
[01:44:29.747 --> 01:44:36.111]  And on average, they're on seven drugs total that are mind-bending.
[01:44:36.451 --> 01:44:38.953]  Because they start acting worse and worse, the answer is more and more drugs.
[01:44:39.173 --> 01:44:40.374]  Did you guys actually find the headline?
[01:44:40.674 --> 01:44:41.175]  That was quick.
[01:44:43.616 --> 01:44:45.798]  That one was saying all Americans, we're looking for foster.
[01:44:46.258 --> 01:44:46.879]  Okay, yeah.
[01:44:47.499 --> 01:45:03.953]  I just remember a WOAI report on the state numbers and they had state hearings and the state defended it and said, well the fact that we're putting 70, I think it was like 71 percent of our kids on these drugs is okay because that's a national average as well.
[01:45:05.654 --> 01:45:13.901]  In fact, the headline was over two-thirds of Texas foster children on mind-altering prescriptions.
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:18.262]  Congress asks why foster children take more mental health meds than other kids.
[01:45:18.322 --> 01:45:20.783]  That's Yahoo News 2014.
[01:45:22.264 --> 01:45:27.267]  The point is, when you're in the government's grasp, they do horrible things.
[01:45:28.527 --> 01:45:30.288]  By the way, I'm not doing a cliffhanger here.
[01:45:30.348 --> 01:45:31.289]  I don't really do that.
[01:45:32.449 --> 01:45:35.491]  I have a tendency to say we have big news coming up and then just start saying it right then.
[01:45:37.498 --> 01:45:46.486]  Our reporters were only 10 miles away from the state police headquarters they were going to go to and say, here we are, we hear the feds that are commanding you are looking for us, we're just reporters, we have nothing to hide.
[01:45:46.506 --> 01:45:56.615]  They would already be there, but the checkpoint has a huge traffic backup now, and so they've been in traffic for almost an hour.
[01:45:57.423 --> 01:46:01.225]  Trying to get 10 miles in Austria because of the checkpoints they've set up all over the place.
[01:46:01.245 --> 01:46:03.287]  So they are in traffic, in a checkpoint.
[01:46:03.307 --> 01:46:10.011]  They're unable to get Skype right now, so you can't see that, but they are shooting HD video so that we can show the traffic jam.
[01:46:10.251 --> 01:46:13.673]  There's the headline, Traffic Jam Caused by Bilderberg Security.
[01:46:15.154 --> 01:46:17.936]  Traffic Jam Caused by Secret Government Conspiracy.
[01:46:18.837 --> 01:46:23.860]  I know I told you guys to do it, but we've called them and told them to shoot video right of that traffic jam.
[01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:25.621]  Fantastic, great job.
[01:46:31.141 --> 01:46:34.386]  Now I mentioned this earlier but I forgot to play the clip so I'm going to do it now.
[01:46:36.969 --> 01:46:38.191]  And it ties into this report.
[01:46:38.291 --> 01:46:42.598]  Hillary's plan to stuff the ballot box by Phyllis Schlafly of WorldNetDaily.
[01:46:44.451 --> 01:46:47.773]  She spotlights the devious plan to capture even more illegal alien votes.
[01:46:47.833 --> 01:46:48.973]  And then she goes over Clinton.
[01:46:49.293 --> 01:46:52.795]  Now all these states are issuing the illegals driver's license, then letting them vote.
[01:46:53.175 --> 01:46:55.897]  Illinois and New York are saying, let illegals vote openly.
[01:46:56.517 --> 01:46:58.018]  So first they denied that was the plan.
[01:46:58.038 --> 01:47:06.422]  Now they're just, I mean, can I go to Mexico or Nigeria or China and show up and get free health care and have my baby and then vote?
[01:47:06.602 --> 01:47:06.882]  No!
[01:47:07.002 --> 01:47:07.903]  They'd laugh at me.
[01:47:08.283 --> 01:47:08.903]  And they should.
[01:47:08.923 --> 01:47:12.245]  Of course you can't vote in China, so I guess it's kind of a non-issue.
[01:47:14.189 --> 01:47:14.929]  Because it's so free.
[01:47:14.969 --> 01:47:15.870]  It's the model, of course.
[01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:16.870]  All the trendies are into it.
[01:47:19.751 --> 01:47:21.412]  They're also into, quote, killing their kids.
[01:47:22.132 --> 01:47:22.833]  It's so sexy.
[01:47:22.893 --> 01:47:26.314]  If you're a new listener, we actually have clips of communists saying, I kill my kids.
[01:47:26.374 --> 01:47:27.034]  I kill my kids.
[01:47:27.074 --> 01:47:28.075]  I love killing my kids.
[01:47:28.335 --> 01:47:28.975]  I love Satan.
[01:47:29.275 --> 01:47:31.016]  I love long arm hair.
[01:47:31.056 --> 01:47:31.997]  I love stinking.
[01:47:32.817 --> 01:47:33.497]  I just love it.
[01:47:35.178 --> 01:47:39.640]  That ties into ICE director struggles to explain release of thousands of criminal migrants.
[01:47:42.105 --> 01:47:45.928]  79,000 crimes plus committed by 30,000 released just last year.
[01:47:45.968 --> 01:47:46.888]  We don't have numbers yet.
[01:47:47.989 --> 01:47:55.815]  By the way, ICE just released 30,000 more violent criminal illegal aliens onto American streets who mainly attack Hispanics.
[01:48:00.455 --> 01:48:01.996]  I guess we want to collapse like Mexico.
[01:48:02.116 --> 01:48:03.878]  We've got to get a handle on this right now, folks.
[01:48:03.918 --> 01:48:04.918]  This is out of control.
[01:48:05.539 --> 01:48:19.390]  That ties into congressional testimony earlier this year with families talking about losing their loved ones to criminal illegals who've been released when no one else would be, be they Hispanic, black or white or Asian.
[01:48:19.410 --> 01:48:21.812]  If you're a citizen, you get put in prison.
[01:48:21.852 --> 01:48:27.096]  But if you're an illegal, you are a magical creature who gets released over and over and over again.
[01:48:27.136 --> 01:48:28.397]  Let's go to that testimony.
[01:48:29.602 --> 01:48:30.823]  My name is Jamil Shaw.
[01:48:31.343 --> 01:48:35.387]  My son, Jamil Andre Shaw II, was murdered by a dreamer.
[01:48:36.087 --> 01:48:40.551]  DACA recipient, a child brought to this country by no fault of his own.
[01:48:41.372 --> 01:48:46.036]  My family's peace and freedom were stolen by an illegal alien from Mexico.
[01:48:46.716 --> 01:48:51.559]  He was brought here by his illegal alien parents and allowed to grow up as a wild animal.
[01:48:52.219 --> 01:48:58.783]  Some people believe that if you are brought over by no fault of your own, that it makes you a good person.
[01:48:59.223 --> 01:49:02.225]  They want us to believe that Dream Act kids don't murder.
[01:49:02.905 --> 01:49:04.586]  I am here to debunk that myth.
[01:49:05.227 --> 01:49:09.630]  Kids brought over the border by no fault of their own do kill Americans.
[01:49:10.190 --> 01:49:13.592]  How many Americans killed by illegal aliens are too many?
[01:49:14.153 --> 01:49:14.313]  One?
[01:49:14.633 --> 01:49:14.893]  Two?
[01:49:15.273 --> 01:49:15.634]  Hundred?
[01:49:15.914 --> 01:49:16.374]  Thousand?
[01:49:16.794 --> 01:49:17.555]  Hundred thousand?
[01:49:18.235 --> 01:49:23.439]  Ask any parent whose child was murdered by an illegal alien, how many is too many?
[01:49:24.039 --> 01:49:27.902]  As one of those parents, I am here to tell you that one is too many.
[01:49:28.562 --> 01:49:35.584]  My son, Jamil Shah II, was murdered while walking on his own street, three houses down from his home.
[01:49:36.045 --> 01:49:42.307]  An illegal alien on his third gun charge was visiting a neighbor where my son was coming home.
[01:49:43.027 --> 01:49:46.468]  He shot my son in the stomach and then in the head, killing him.
[01:49:47.328 --> 01:49:48.909]  Do black lives really matter?
[01:49:49.389 --> 01:49:54.011]  Or does it matter only if you are shot by a white person or a white policeman?
[01:49:55.717 --> 01:49:59.161]  Well, yes, that is the only time it matters, because George Soros wants us all killing each other.
[01:50:00.903 --> 01:50:14.177]  And, again, the gang culture, whether it be white, black, or Hispanic, is being protected and being fostered, and being allowed to grow, because if you read Zbigniew Brzezinski's Between the Technotronic Era,
[01:50:15.731 --> 01:50:29.180]  They admit that governments like to have combines of criminals that run everything in certain racial areas so that they can basically control those populations through the criminals that actually work for them.
[01:50:30.181 --> 01:50:35.385]  And just like it's come out that some of the biggest Mexican drug cartels work for the CIA and the DEA,
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:41.341]  Destabilizing Mexico, just like ISIS works for our government.
[01:50:42.181 --> 01:50:43.321]  This is the sick plan.
[01:50:43.381 --> 01:50:45.762]  So they sell it like, oh, you just don't like Hispanics.
[01:50:46.902 --> 01:50:51.563]  No, I love everybody, as long as they're not welfare head criminals.
[01:50:53.424 --> 01:50:58.545]  And what's happening is the entire world, China's now replaced Mexico as the biggest
[01:51:00.194 --> 01:51:07.037]  Destination group coming here, China runs ads, saying move to America, get everything free, and the deadbeats are coming over here.
[01:51:07.378 --> 01:51:09.819]  We advertise to get all the deadbeats on the planet.
[01:51:09.879 --> 01:51:10.379]  It's a joke!
[01:51:10.699 --> 01:51:14.761]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:14.801 --> 01:51:17.823]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:18.003 --> 01:51:19.344]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:19.624 --> 01:51:22.665]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:22.966 --> 01:51:23.926]  Infidel Body Armor.

[01:51:26.469 --> 01:51:28.410]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.

[01:51:41.687 --> 01:51:42.447]  This is Dan Pilla.
[01:51:42.467 --> 01:51:43.988]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:51:44.288 --> 01:51:45.569]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:45.929 --> 01:51:48.270]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:48.750 --> 01:51:50.611]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:51.051 --> 01:51:55.093]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:51:55.553 --> 01:51:59.255]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:51:59.495 --> 01:52:02.957]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.

[01:52:03.717 --> 01:52:05.338]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:52:10.936 --> 01:52:12.656]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:52:12.857 --> 01:52:16.197]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:52:16.497 --> 01:52:17.478]  A pair of scissors.
[01:52:17.858 --> 01:52:23.339]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[01:52:23.639 --> 01:52:28.300]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:29.381]  The phone line.
[01:52:29.541 --> 01:52:34.462]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:52:34.802 --> 01:52:38.543]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:52:38.703 --> 01:52:41.607]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[01:52:42.028 --> 01:52:44.271]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[01:52:44.491 --> 01:52:48.697]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[01:52:48.837 --> 01:52:49.738]  Scissors can't cut it.

[01:53:12.462 --> 01:53:13.884]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[01:53:14.325 --> 01:53:15.587]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[01:53:15.827 --> 01:53:16.929]  Mine has fallen apart.
[01:53:17.329 --> 01:53:23.117]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[01:53:23.498 --> 01:53:26.301]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[01:53:26.722 --> 01:53:27.243]  What is that?
[01:53:27.543 --> 01:53:36.645]  Well, apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[01:53:37.085 --> 01:53:45.486]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[01:53:45.807 --> 01:53:46.127]  Wow!
[01:53:46.427 --> 01:53:47.367]  That sounds scary.
[01:53:47.747 --> 01:53:52.088]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold shielded wallet.
[01:53:52.188 --> 01:53:53.008]  Are they more expensive?
[01:53:53.468 --> 01:53:53.688]  No.
[01:53:53.968 --> 01:54:01.231]  In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from IDStronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[01:54:01.651 --> 01:54:02.491]  Sounds great!
[01:54:02.851 --> 01:54:05.452]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[01:54:05.472 --> 01:54:09.594]  I want to be protected, and these wallets at IDStronghold.com look fantastic!
[01:54:17.477 --> 01:54:18.857]  Alex Jones here back live.
[01:54:18.877 --> 01:54:21.058]  Speaking of Bilderberg, here is the New York Times.
[01:54:22.096 --> 01:54:25.057]  Former Governor Jeb Bush's chief of staff responded a few weeks ago.
[01:54:25.137 --> 01:54:31.901]  Bloomberg covered it to our tweet asking him, are you going to be attending Bilderberg because you're going to be in Germany and Austria when it's going on?
[01:54:32.521 --> 01:54:33.762]  And his chief of staff said no.
[01:54:35.142 --> 01:54:38.884]  And the media made jokes about it and said how dare they even respond to InfoWars.
[01:54:39.424 --> 01:54:40.445]  That's not real media.
[01:54:41.385 --> 01:54:47.288]  Really, they're holding the G7 in Europe right before Bilderberg and the very people that are at the G7 will be there.
[01:54:49.574 --> 01:54:56.016]  And so many other people that are about to run for president, like Bill Clinton and others, go to Bilderberg first to get vetted.
[01:54:56.376 --> 01:54:59.357]  But again, it's the mainstream media's job to make jokes out of that.
[01:54:59.777 --> 01:55:01.958]  Here's the headline out of the New York Times today.
[01:55:02.518 --> 01:55:06.599]  Berlin Leary of One Bush prepares to meet Jeb.
[01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:11.421]  And he's going to be giving a speech there.
[01:55:12.435 --> 01:55:14.116]  Hey Alex, we have Rob on the line.
[01:55:14.176 --> 01:55:15.677]  They are at the location.
[01:55:16.077 --> 01:55:17.278]  They are at the police station.
[01:55:17.318 --> 01:55:19.859]  Okay, let's go to Rob Dew in Austria reporting on Bilderberg.
[01:55:19.899 --> 01:55:20.520]  He just joined us.
[01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:23.922]  Austrian Federal Police are searching for Infowars reporters.
[01:55:23.942 --> 01:55:24.782]  They came to their hotel.
[01:55:25.162 --> 01:55:26.043]  Our crew was gone.
[01:55:26.403 --> 01:55:28.604]  Josh and of course Rob Dew.
[01:55:28.985 --> 01:55:30.966]  And so Dew, go ahead, take over.
[01:55:32.286 --> 01:55:33.827]  Okay, well I'm about to walk in.
[01:55:34.828 --> 01:55:36.829]  I'm going to show everybody a shot of the police station.
[01:55:36.949 --> 01:55:37.870]  Can you hear me loud and clear?
[01:55:37.890 --> 01:55:38.590]  Yes we can, sir.
[01:55:39.451 --> 01:55:40.911]  Okay, so I'm about to go in.
[01:55:42.861 --> 01:55:46.084]  These look like the police vans that were driving around.
[01:55:46.464 --> 01:55:53.449]  You know, this is the same type of police van that was at our location earlier today, so this looks like it's the same.
[01:55:53.609 --> 01:55:58.312]  And when they say turn your camera off, just say to them, it's for my protection.
[01:55:59.433 --> 01:55:59.633]  Right.
[01:55:59.713 --> 01:56:05.657]  You guys have already been very rude and aggressive, and I'm here to file a complaint about them going to your hotel.
[01:56:05.697 --> 01:56:06.037]  Go ahead.
[01:56:06.978 --> 01:56:08.559]  Get on the offense with these people.
[01:56:08.579 --> 01:56:11.321]  Okay, I'm walking in now.
[01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:19.361]  Inside the Austrian substation of the state police.
[01:56:20.842 --> 01:56:24.683]  And tell them the feds are looking for you and you're there to talk to them.
[01:56:25.684 --> 01:56:25.884]  Okay.
[01:56:27.585 --> 01:56:28.705]  How do I change this to me?
[01:56:28.785 --> 01:56:30.066]  Is there a way to do that?
[01:56:30.086 --> 01:56:30.926]  Oh, you hit that?
[01:56:31.226 --> 01:56:31.446]  Okay.
[01:56:32.327 --> 01:56:32.547]  Okay.
[01:56:32.747 --> 01:56:33.267]  There you go, guys.
[01:56:33.287 --> 01:56:33.727]  Good job.
[01:56:34.328 --> 01:56:34.568]  Yeah.
[01:56:35.228 --> 01:56:36.148]  There I am.
[01:56:36.388 --> 01:56:42.591]  I'm hitting the intercom there to talk to them.
[01:56:46.823 --> 01:56:48.164]  They're probably freaking out.
[01:56:49.004 --> 01:56:52.826]  I love your 1776 hat.
[01:56:54.527 --> 01:56:58.469]  I had to wear a little plug if you're going to get arrested.
[01:56:59.330 --> 01:57:04.172]  That was the first time we fought the Germans was in 1776 when they brought over the Hessians.
[01:57:04.432 --> 01:57:06.153]  Of course most of them just defected and joined us.
[01:57:06.533 --> 01:57:09.815]  We just want to invite all the Germans and Austrians to join the move for freedom.
[01:57:09.835 --> 01:57:11.336]  There's a lot of great folks over there.
[01:57:14.773 --> 01:57:16.675]  Like, some of our most active listeners are over there.
[01:57:18.616 --> 01:57:23.761]  Okay, I think they, it looks like they have someone in there right now, so they're not letting a couple people, two people in.
[01:57:24.161 --> 01:57:26.524]  But, uh, we'll see.
[01:57:26.564 --> 01:57:29.426]  This is, this is, uh, the Austrian police substation.
[01:57:29.686 --> 01:57:29.867]  Hi.
[01:57:33.210 --> 01:57:33.530]  Hello.
[01:57:33.610 --> 01:57:34.791]  Did I just talk to you on the phone?
[01:57:35.312 --> 01:57:35.632]  Okay.
[01:57:35.692 --> 01:57:36.092]  I called in.
[01:57:36.192 --> 01:57:36.793]  My name is Rob Dew.
[01:57:36.833 --> 01:57:38.294]  I'm a journalist out of Austin, Texas.
[01:57:38.314 --> 01:57:39.015]  How are you doing?
[01:57:40.083 --> 01:57:40.403]  Okay.
[01:57:41.363 --> 01:57:43.884]  So, I'm broadcasting live for my protection.
[01:57:43.904 --> 01:57:45.344]  We're on a live radio show right now.
[01:57:45.704 --> 01:57:51.386]  But I got a call from my hotel manager and he said that the... I don't know.
[01:57:52.566 --> 01:57:52.946]  You don't know?
[01:57:52.966 --> 01:57:59.068]  Well, we're online.
[01:57:59.628 --> 01:57:59.908]  Yeah.
[01:58:02.909 --> 01:58:04.509]  So... Which hotel do you stay?
[01:58:04.749 --> 01:58:06.910]  I'm at the Rumferhof Hotel.
[01:58:09.625 --> 01:58:12.987]  And just tell them you're tired of being harassed.
[01:58:13.007 --> 01:58:14.908]  Yeah, so they came to our hotel twice.
[01:58:15.568 --> 01:58:18.710]  And today they came and we weren't there.
[01:58:19.170 --> 01:58:25.074]  And so my hotel manager called me and wanted to know... Hi, how are you doing?
[01:58:25.274 --> 01:58:26.615]  You're staying in your office room, right?
[01:58:27.315 --> 01:58:27.575]  Yes.
[01:58:27.835 --> 01:58:33.038]  Yeah, as my colleagues here told you yesterday, it's not allowed to film the police or anything from the police stations.
[01:58:33.699 --> 01:58:34.619]  Thank you, goodbye.
[01:58:34.719 --> 01:58:35.620]  Ask them what the wall is.
[01:58:38.479 --> 01:58:40.400]  Alright, well tell them you'll turn... Oh, look at those guys.
[01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:41.500]  They think they're so cool.
[01:58:43.341 --> 01:58:44.802]  Hold on.
[01:58:44.862 --> 01:58:45.162]  Alright, dude.
[01:58:45.182 --> 01:58:47.203]  Go ahead and put your camera down when we come back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:47.223 --> 01:58:47.863]  Put your camera down.
[01:58:48.664 --> 01:58:49.644]  And then try to be nice to them.
[01:58:49.664 --> 01:58:50.444]  Play good cop with them.
[01:58:50.745 --> 01:58:54.246]  Thank you for listening to TCS.
[01:58:54.286 --> 01:58:56.547]  And I've never been over there, but my grandfathers were.
[01:58:56.567 --> 01:58:57.408]  Visit TCMI.com today.
[01:58:57.448 --> 01:58:57.928]  We'll be back.
[01:59:00.188 --> 01:59:16.614]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[01:59:16.634 --> 01:59:20.355]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[01:59:20.695 --> 01:59:24.359]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:26.001]  Hdfirearms.com.
[01:59:26.302 --> 01:59:29.505]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[01:59:29.625 --> 01:59:34.511]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[01:59:34.751 --> 01:59:35.572]  It's always about security.
[01:59:35.572 --> 01:59:35.972]  I think so.
[02:00:02.668 --> 02:00:05.273]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:16.229 --> 02:00:20.393]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:21.073 --> 02:00:21.874]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.655 --> 02:00:23.836]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.876 --> 02:00:26.979]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio.
[02:00:27.019 --> 02:00:28.160]  Alex Jones here back live.
[02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:32.584]  Live video feed, audio feed from the state police headquarters in the area.
[02:00:33.024 --> 02:00:34.405]  Rob Dues has been thrown out.
[02:00:34.466 --> 02:00:36.267]  Tell us what happened during the break, Rob.
[02:00:36.287 --> 02:00:37.248]  I couldn't skip that break.
[02:00:37.268 --> 02:00:37.969]  It was in the hour.
[02:00:38.869 --> 02:00:39.150]  Sure.
[02:00:39.230 --> 02:00:42.633]  Well, you probably saw what the large guy came out.
[02:00:43.399 --> 02:00:44.940]  They seem to have a size differential.
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:50.144]  Whenever the large guys come out, there's always a bit of air and angst about them.
[02:00:50.184 --> 02:00:52.366]  But he came out and said, you're Rob Dool?
[02:00:52.986 --> 02:00:55.068]  Yes, we told you not to film the police.
[02:00:55.909 --> 02:00:59.591]  And then he said something else and then left.
[02:00:59.612 --> 02:01:02.714]  So I guess maybe that's what they're going to tell me, not to film the checkpoints anymore.
[02:01:03.515 --> 02:01:03.755]  Which...
[02:01:05.074 --> 02:01:06.954]  That seemed to be the message that they wanted to give me.
[02:01:08.155 --> 02:01:09.935]  They never said, don't film the checkpoints.
[02:01:10.215 --> 02:01:15.876]  All the guy said was, that's rude to do, to film checkpoints, or to film the police, when they had cameras.
[02:01:15.896 --> 02:01:17.997]  Yeah, you tried to ask him what the law is.
[02:01:18.017 --> 02:01:18.797]  What did he say to that?
[02:01:19.577 --> 02:01:20.417]  He didn't answer me.
[02:01:20.477 --> 02:01:22.758]  He walked off, and then the other guy got all snippy.
[02:01:22.798 --> 02:01:24.978]  He goes, there's no discussion during the break.
[02:01:24.998 --> 02:01:26.259]  He said, there's no discussion.
[02:01:26.299 --> 02:01:27.939]  We have the whole thing on video.
[02:01:27.959 --> 02:01:28.919]  Josh shot it as well.
[02:01:29.359 --> 02:01:33.080]  I was also recording audio, and we had a hidden pin
[02:01:33.700 --> 02:01:36.061]  So I guess we've given them all our intelligence at this point.
[02:01:37.041 --> 02:01:37.881]  We're not hiding anything.
[02:01:37.901 --> 02:01:38.841]  You told them you were filming.
[02:01:39.801 --> 02:01:40.841]  Yeah, I told them we were filming.
[02:01:40.881 --> 02:01:42.182]  I told them we were broadcasting live.
[02:01:42.562 --> 02:01:48.823]  And, you know, all I can say is they have a very pretty receptionist.
[02:01:51.683 --> 02:01:53.664]  Well, you're married and Josh has got a girlfriend.
[02:01:54.404 --> 02:01:55.064]  That's right.
[02:01:55.204 --> 02:01:57.124]  What happens in Austria stays in Austria.
[02:01:57.664 --> 02:01:58.504]  No, no, no, no.
[02:01:58.564 --> 02:02:00.785]  She did look receptive like she wanted you to pick her up.
[02:02:01.781 --> 02:02:02.982]  No, no.
[02:02:03.583 --> 02:02:08.748]  It was, uh, it's just very, this is just a very weird police state.
[02:02:08.768 --> 02:02:11.170]  There's not a lot of, you know, communication from them.
[02:02:11.190 --> 02:02:14.153]  Uh, I have no problem with not filming their checkpoints.
[02:02:14.173 --> 02:02:15.074]  They never said that.
[02:02:15.514 --> 02:02:16.375]  Oh, give me a break.
[02:02:16.395 --> 02:02:18.037]  They're checkpoints on a highway.
[02:02:18.057 --> 02:02:19.959]  They got the cameras all aimed at us.
[02:02:20.279 --> 02:02:22.861]  I mean, look, you're just acting like you've done something wrong.
[02:02:23.542 --> 02:02:24.803]  Wait, no, here's the thing, Alex.
[02:02:24.823 --> 02:02:29.086]  When we went there through the first checkpoint, the first time, we didn't even have our cameras going.
[02:02:29.426 --> 02:02:30.727]  And they flipped out!
[02:02:31.007 --> 02:02:32.288]  They were flipping out on us.
[02:02:32.508 --> 02:02:36.030]  They had their hands on their guns like we were doing something bad because we showed them U.S.
[02:02:36.070 --> 02:02:36.631]  passports.
[02:02:37.431 --> 02:02:38.172]  We showed them U.S.
[02:02:38.212 --> 02:02:38.732]  passports.
[02:02:38.952 --> 02:02:40.313]  The Yankees are attacking!
[02:02:40.413 --> 02:02:42.195]  That's kind of a Russian accent.
[02:02:43.335 --> 02:02:44.976]  Oh no, the Yankees are here!
[02:02:45.076 --> 02:02:45.677]  Oh no!
[02:02:46.117 --> 02:02:46.658]  Hans, run!
[02:02:46.698 --> 02:02:48.559]  What's the big deal?
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:53.162]  So, you know, of course, the next time we're going through the checkpoint, we're going to film it!
[02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:56.585]  And they got all mad that the second time I went through the checkpoint we filmed it.
[02:02:56.706 --> 02:02:58.990]  And then they tried to tell me I was rude for filming them.
[02:02:59.781 --> 02:03:02.623]  You know, and I'm like, look, I'm not trying to be rude.
[02:03:02.743 --> 02:03:04.505]  The point is, they keep turning it around.
[02:03:04.525 --> 02:03:07.727]  Dude, dude, this is what they do.
[02:03:08.088 --> 02:03:17.475]  They make it like you're a criminal so you didn't defend yourself, changing the subject to them having checkpoints, trying to act like the press is illegal, covering a very important event.
[02:03:17.855 --> 02:03:20.938]  I would say to them next, is filming illegal in Austria?
[02:03:21.018 --> 02:03:21.858]  Tell me the law.
[02:03:22.459 --> 02:03:23.259]  We are press.
[02:03:23.379 --> 02:03:25.121]  Why are you covering up the criminal meeting?
[02:03:27.085 --> 02:03:30.847]  Because as soon as we did that in Switzerland, they stopped acting aggressive.
[02:03:31.167 --> 02:03:34.068]  We said, go back and check with your canton leaders, state leaders.
[02:03:34.588 --> 02:03:35.869]  You're going to get in a lot of trouble.
[02:03:36.189 --> 02:03:40.251]  And then next, they were very polite and helpful after those exchanges.
[02:03:40.311 --> 02:03:42.812]  So I would just say, hey, we're not criminals.
[02:03:43.152 --> 02:03:44.113]  We're here to cover this.
[02:03:44.153 --> 02:03:45.253]  You let us in the country.
[02:03:45.533 --> 02:03:46.974]  You ought to be glad we're covering it.
[02:03:47.394 --> 02:03:48.835]  Don't you want to know what's going on?
[02:03:48.855 --> 02:03:51.856]  Because I guarantee you, those people don't know anything.
[02:03:51.896 --> 02:03:54.057]  They're in there talking about sports scores all day.
[02:03:55.279 --> 02:03:55.540]  Right.
[02:03:56.161 --> 02:03:57.022]  And taking selfies.
[02:03:58.224 --> 02:04:03.293]  We're actually going back up to the other checkpoint, so I don't know, how much longer is the show going?
[02:04:04.696 --> 02:04:05.678]  We've got an hour left.
[02:04:06.198 --> 02:04:08.382]  So how far away from that checkpoint are you?
[02:04:09.181 --> 02:04:10.341]  I would say about six minutes.
[02:04:11.182 --> 02:04:15.983]  We've got a little bit of traffic getting down here, but after that it's smooth sailing.
[02:04:16.003 --> 02:04:17.704]  We'll do this.
[02:04:18.184 --> 02:04:19.784]  Pull over, take a break.
[02:04:20.485 --> 02:04:33.529]  I'm going to come in, talk for about five minutes about Bilderberg and some interesting developments with Joe Biggs, but be on Skype with us, and then with Joe Biggs in here with us, you can then go live up to the checkpoint.
[02:04:34.713 --> 02:04:38.975]  And when they come and say, I already told you no filming.
[02:04:39.395 --> 02:04:41.196]  You say, tell me the law.
[02:04:41.556 --> 02:04:43.237]  I want to know the law.
[02:04:43.657 --> 02:04:45.258]  Tell me why.
[02:04:45.278 --> 02:04:47.078]  Do you have cameras?
[02:04:47.158 --> 02:04:48.819]  I guarantee you they've got cameras at the checkpoint.
[02:04:49.479 --> 02:04:50.560]  And so just talk to them.
[02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:53.421]  Because believe me, they don't want to escalate this.
[02:04:54.021 --> 02:04:55.142]  They'd love to arrest you.
[02:04:55.902 --> 02:05:01.847]  And get brownie points with their masters, but they've been told don't do that because it'll draw more attention.
[02:05:02.508 --> 02:05:07.692]  And then the press will be forced to report on the criminal mafia meeting, Mafia 2.0, taking place.
[02:05:07.953 --> 02:05:09.054]  Rob Dewey, just stay on the line with us.
[02:05:09.074 --> 02:05:09.995]  We're gonna come right back to you.
[02:05:10.856 --> 02:05:14.339]  Checkpoints, harassment, and Cobra Commandos.
[02:05:14.780 --> 02:05:17.662]  This is not your granddaddy's smoke-filled room.
[02:05:18.043 --> 02:05:20.385]  This is Bilderberg 2015.
[02:05:21.146 --> 02:05:29.233]  Every year, the Bilderberg Confab tweaks its efforts to lock out the media, deny transparency, and keep its agenda secret.
[02:05:30.194 --> 02:05:45.388]  Similar to the 6.2 mile exclusion zone around the radioactive Chernobyl plant, Austrian Federal Police have set up a similar sized zone to keep the public away from the hotel where over 150 world leaders will meet in secret.
[02:05:45.948 --> 02:05:55.195]  Info Wars reporters were stopped at a checkpoint, had their vehicle searched, and even had police come to the front door of their hotel room.
[02:05:55.815 --> 02:06:02.740]  All in the name of keeping their cameras away from the 150 world leaders attempting to meet in secret.
[02:06:03.020 --> 02:06:08.084]  We'll have continual coverage of Bilderberg on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:25.965]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[02:06:26.205 --> 02:06:29.706]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[02:06:30.066 --> 02:06:33.728]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[02:06:34.108 --> 02:06:35.369]  Hdfirearms.com.
[02:06:35.649 --> 02:06:38.851]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[02:06:38.971 --> 02:06:43.873]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[02:06:44.093 --> 02:06:47.835]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[02:06:48.035 --> 02:06:50.336]  Go to their website, hdfirearms.com.
[02:06:50.396 --> 02:06:54.619]  Buy right off their website, and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice.
[02:06:54.819 --> 02:06:58.000]  You can pick it up at the gun show, you can pick it up at a local sporting goods store.
[02:06:58.180 --> 02:06:58.921]  Whatever you do,
[02:06:59.361 --> 02:07:02.303]  Get your Head Down firearm today.
[02:07:02.523 --> 02:07:06.885]  The spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms.
[02:07:07.025 --> 02:07:08.126]  HDfirearms.com.
[02:07:08.146 --> 02:07:10.227]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[02:07:10.287 --> 02:07:10.707]  Good, brother.
[02:07:10.848 --> 02:07:12.508]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:07:12.569 --> 02:07:14.350]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:07:14.530 --> 02:07:18.552]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:07:18.572 --> 02:07:21.133]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:07:21.173 --> 02:07:23.395]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:07:23.595 --> 02:07:25.636]  Super Mill Vitality was developed.
[02:07:25.896 --> 02:07:31.521]  To activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:07:31.722 --> 02:07:34.884]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[02:07:34.904 --> 02:07:36.506]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:07:36.546 --> 02:07:39.429]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:07:39.449 --> 02:07:40.970]  Saving a ton of money there.
[02:07:41.230 --> 02:07:43.693]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[02:07:44.053 --> 02:07:44.233]  Silver.
[02:08:16.599 --> 02:08:20.740]  Let me see you strip!
[02:08:20.940 --> 02:08:27.081]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:27.142 --> 02:08:33.523]  Because there is a war, or you are mine.
[02:08:33.543 --> 02:08:36.144]  This is the song you play on the PlayStation.
[02:08:36.164 --> 02:08:37.724]  Metropolis has nothing but this.
[02:08:37.784 --> 02:08:39.704]  We're in Austria, our borders are.
[02:08:39.804 --> 02:08:41.925]  I take what we can.
[02:08:42.620 --> 02:08:43.722]  Joe Biggs is here.
[02:08:43.742 --> 02:08:45.946]  Let's keep rolling this song for a little bit of Rammstein.
[02:09:18.117 --> 02:09:19.498]  Without your television!
[02:09:19.558 --> 02:09:22.000]  Without your television!
[02:09:22.100 --> 02:09:25.944]  Let me hear you speaking just for
[02:09:30.237 --> 02:09:31.198]  Joe Biggs is here with us.
[02:09:31.238 --> 02:09:32.899]  He's got news on Bilderberg.
[02:09:32.919 --> 02:09:35.061]  Big news from their own press.
[02:09:35.201 --> 02:09:35.922]  Very interesting.
[02:09:36.402 --> 02:09:39.725]  But before that, we've got Rob Due and Josh Owens about to pull up to the checkpoint.
[02:09:39.945 --> 02:09:40.946]  They've been looking for him.
[02:09:40.986 --> 02:09:43.307]  They came to their hotel, but they dare videotape him.
[02:09:43.528 --> 02:09:50.173]  Let's take you now live to Austria, the site of Bilderberg, the criminal group meeting being protected by state and federal police.
[02:09:50.513 --> 02:09:54.416]  Josh Owens and Rob Due, you are now in charge.
[02:09:54.456 --> 02:09:54.836]  Go ahead.
[02:09:55.197 --> 02:09:57.799]  Josh, or Jones, I just want to show you something here.
[02:09:57.839 --> 02:09:59.320]  If you look on that interhelping sign,
[02:10:00.302 --> 02:10:01.143]  It just went by.
[02:10:01.403 --> 02:10:04.165]  It had a Info Wars bumper sticker on it.
[02:10:05.746 --> 02:10:08.208]  I want to be clear, that's not you guys doing that, is it?
[02:10:09.189 --> 02:10:10.130]  No, not at all.
[02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:11.411]  I'll go by one more time.
[02:10:11.971 --> 02:10:14.593]  I'll go by one more time and then we'll head out and slow down right there.
[02:10:15.634 --> 02:10:17.275]  Because our stickers are all over the world.
[02:10:17.295 --> 02:10:18.736]  I mean, our stickers are all over the world.
[02:10:18.976 --> 02:10:21.599]  But I mean, really, I want to know.
[02:10:22.179 --> 02:10:24.681]  It's the dot in the I on the inner Alpen.
[02:10:26.164 --> 02:10:29.105]  So, I just wanted to, we just happened to be driving by that spot again.
[02:10:29.525 --> 02:10:31.346]  We saw that as we pulled in today.
[02:10:31.366 --> 02:10:32.646]  Or, uh, yesterday.
[02:10:32.706 --> 02:10:33.987]  I took a picture, was it yesterday?
[02:10:34.007 --> 02:10:35.007]  Yeah, it was yesterday, I guess.
[02:10:35.488 --> 02:10:36.508]  I took a photo of it.
[02:10:36.648 --> 02:10:36.888]  Tweet it.
[02:10:36.948 --> 02:10:37.868]  And tweeted that out.
[02:10:37.908 --> 02:10:40.009]  Oh good, get it tweeted.
[02:10:40.089 --> 02:10:42.310]  Alright, tell folks where you are, what's about to happen.
[02:10:42.330 --> 02:10:44.011]  Some stations don't carry that first five minutes.
[02:10:44.391 --> 02:10:45.731]  You were thrown out of the police station.
[02:10:45.751 --> 02:10:48.692]  They said, you rob do, you not film police.
[02:10:50.533 --> 02:10:51.934]  Yeah, we already told you that.
[02:10:52.314 --> 02:10:54.195]  And then no one ever said you can't film the police.
[02:10:54.495 --> 02:10:55.275]  No one ever said that.
[02:10:55.865 --> 02:10:56.966]  That's the funny thing.
[02:10:57.146 --> 02:10:58.427]  They're acting like this is old news.
[02:10:58.988 --> 02:11:00.649]  They never said to me, don't film the police.
[02:11:01.370 --> 02:11:03.391]  He's saying they came to your hotel to tell you that.
[02:11:04.272 --> 02:11:05.893]  Yeah, they came to my hotel.
[02:11:06.133 --> 02:11:08.415]  And that's... You know, really?
[02:11:08.475 --> 02:11:09.756]  That's what you came to my hotel for?
[02:11:10.117 --> 02:11:12.459]  Don't put up YouTube videos of police?
[02:11:12.799 --> 02:11:13.980]  I mean, what do you have to hide?
[02:11:14.580 --> 02:11:16.702]  We obviously... That's what they're worried about us.
[02:11:16.762 --> 02:11:18.083]  We obviously have something to hide.
[02:11:18.724 --> 02:11:23.668]  You know, they freaked out and we drove... Now this is... We're gonna drive past... This is where the checkpoint was yesterday.
[02:11:24.551 --> 02:11:24.771]  I don't
[02:11:43.807 --> 02:11:50.589]  And from what we heard, this happened because I guess people were complaining, so they made the security area smaller.
[02:11:50.649 --> 02:11:52.090]  Because this is where they had us yesterday.
[02:11:52.110 --> 02:11:53.190]  This is where we pulled off.
[02:11:53.770 --> 02:11:56.411]  And there's a giant thing that says, we're filming you.
[02:11:56.431 --> 02:11:59.752]  There's a giant camera sign right there that says, we're filming you.
[02:12:00.773 --> 02:12:03.894]  But they got mad when I was filming and called me rude.
[02:12:04.194 --> 02:12:04.994]  They're roving Czech.
[02:12:05.014 --> 02:12:09.176]  Well, tell them, when they say that it's bad character to film, say, well, you're filming down the street.
[02:12:09.216 --> 02:12:09.856]  You're filming here.
[02:12:12.412 --> 02:12:12.672]  Right.
[02:12:13.212 --> 02:12:15.433]  And I don't know if we're going to start losing signal.
[02:12:15.513 --> 02:12:19.195]  We're going out of the town area and going up the mountain.
[02:12:19.655 --> 02:12:31.681]  And it's notoriously spotty surface up here, as we've been finding out from our different, trying to... We've seen the best reception down in Sidetail, so I'll give you a side view.
[02:12:32.201 --> 02:12:33.522]  This is looking down the mountain.
[02:12:34.321 --> 02:12:34.701]  Right now?
[02:12:34.721 --> 02:12:35.342]  Beautiful area.
[02:12:47.315 --> 02:12:49.576]  We're going to get your military perspective in a moment on that.
[02:12:49.616 --> 02:12:54.098]  You've dug up some interesting stuff out of the Austrian and Western press on Cobra.
[02:12:54.618 --> 02:13:01.601]  But before we get into Cobra, I'm going to stay with these guys until they hit the checkpoint or until their feed goes out.
[02:13:02.061 --> 02:13:04.242]  Amazing view of your radio listener.
[02:13:04.602 --> 02:13:06.363]  Looks like they're thousands of feet up on the mountain.
[02:13:06.403 --> 02:13:09.104]  It's frozen with the town down below them.
[02:13:10.284 --> 02:13:15.026]  I tell you, this has got to be, though, even though it's stressful, guys, a good place to be reporting from.
[02:13:15.386 --> 02:13:16.327]  Very, very beautiful.
[02:13:16.787 --> 02:13:19.248]  I expect to see Snow White any moment pop out.
[02:13:24.009 --> 02:13:25.809]  Any other comments, Rob Dew or Josh Owens?
[02:13:26.049 --> 02:13:27.190]  It's very comfortable.
[02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:31.831]  If you can hear me now, it's very comfortable in terms of temperature.
[02:13:32.291 --> 02:13:35.052]  It's nice and cool, but it's not super humid even though it's been raining.
[02:13:35.132 --> 02:13:43.314]  It rained yesterday, it rained today, but it doesn't feel really humid like you get normally in Austin, Texas.
[02:13:43.474 --> 02:13:44.394]  It's a different
[02:13:44.893 --> 02:13:47.294]  A different kind of temperature up here in the mountains.
[02:13:47.394 --> 02:13:56.917]  It just feels like you're... We're losing their feed right now.
[02:13:56.977 --> 02:13:59.978]  You're listening to Bilderberg 2015 coverage that U.S.
[02:14:00.018 --> 02:14:01.039]  media will not cover.
[02:14:01.059 --> 02:14:02.259]  It's all over the foreign press.
[02:14:02.879 --> 02:14:03.680]  Here's the checkpoint.
[02:14:03.740 --> 02:14:04.260]  Here we go.
[02:14:08.681 --> 02:14:08.942]  Yeah.
[02:14:09.702 --> 02:14:10.202]  Here we go.
[02:14:10.222 --> 02:14:10.802]  Coming through here.
[02:14:11.102 --> 02:14:12.743]  So we're going to find out what's going on here.
[02:14:14.656 --> 02:14:15.977]  And let your Skype stabilize.
[02:14:17.158 --> 02:14:18.600]  Stabilize your rear deflectors.
[02:14:19.481 --> 02:14:20.542]  Watch for enemy fighters.
[02:14:24.305 --> 02:14:25.646]  Bring up that you're filming up front.
[02:14:27.348 --> 02:14:29.250]  Just tell them, you know, is this a free country or not?
[02:14:35.492 --> 02:14:38.633]  We're saying the, uh, Interhopin... No, not Interhopin.
[02:14:38.933 --> 02:14:43.115]  I'm, uh, I'm broadcasting live on Skype to U.S., United States, America.
[02:14:43.435 --> 02:14:44.055]  Just letting you know.
[02:14:44.075 --> 02:14:47.596]  Um... We come from America!
[02:14:47.816 --> 02:14:50.257]  They have a picture of Josh and my, uh, passports.
[02:14:50.277 --> 02:14:52.358]  They're actually looking at us right now.
[02:14:54.038 --> 02:14:55.178]  So... Can you imagine?
[02:15:04.756 --> 02:15:05.676]  America's gonna be just like this.
[02:15:05.696 --> 02:15:15.259]  And so the, one of the soldiers is telling them that, or one of the officers, I'm sorry, is uh... They're having him pull over for further interrogation.
[02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:21.541]  These are the ones that keep filming!
[02:15:23.461 --> 02:15:24.422]  Why aren't they scared?
[02:15:29.551 --> 02:15:36.136]  We're going to be breaking all this down and some developments with Cobra, the private paramilitary security force.
[02:15:38.277 --> 02:15:41.419]  Well, they had a picture of your license plate, so they were obviously filming that.
[02:15:41.439 --> 02:15:43.160]  They had my passport photo.
[02:15:43.220 --> 02:15:47.203]  Yeah, but they said it's very impolite and bad, bad, bad behavior.
[02:15:47.463 --> 02:15:48.724]  I'm going to put this back on me.
[02:15:49.345 --> 02:15:50.285]  That you film them, Rob.
[02:15:54.688 --> 02:15:56.870]  Rob, you've been directed over to the side of the road, correct?
[02:16:01.078 --> 02:16:02.540]  I don't believe they're getting my feed.
[02:16:02.941 --> 02:16:04.984]  We're getting intermediate feed from them.
[02:16:06.587 --> 02:16:08.349]  Skype just disconnected.
[02:16:08.389 --> 02:16:09.451]  Let's try to reconnect with them.
[02:16:10.132 --> 02:16:11.194]  Joe Big's watching this.
[02:16:11.214 --> 02:16:13.858]  You've been over in Germany and Austria when you were in the military.
[02:16:14.459 --> 02:16:15.721]  What do you make of their behavior?
[02:16:16.744 --> 02:16:17.785]  It's pretty intense.
[02:16:17.965 --> 02:16:31.493]  The thing that makes me worry a bit is the fact that, like you said earlier, you're making this analogy comparing COBRA to FBI, and I found some documents that pretty much states right here that they are a mixture of much like America's FBI hostage team.
[02:16:32.374 --> 02:16:34.515]  Are they private or are they... Federal.
[02:16:36.481 --> 02:16:37.082]  Because U.S.
[02:16:37.122 --> 02:16:40.263]  media and other media just simply said they were private security.
[02:16:40.504 --> 02:16:41.044]  They're federal.
[02:16:41.384 --> 02:16:42.685]  Yeah, they are a federal group.
[02:16:43.265 --> 02:16:47.928]  And then you were reading out of a German newspaper where they admit that they're at a castle where they used to torture people.
[02:16:48.068 --> 02:16:51.990]  Yeah, it's called the Shona Castle and it's around... Document cam on that, guys.
[02:16:52.351 --> 02:16:53.331]  It's around Vienna.
[02:16:53.711 --> 02:16:57.173]  It's 19 miles south of the ancient Austrian capital.
[02:16:57.614 --> 02:17:04.218]  It's a 60-room castle surrounded by a 70-acre wooded park and surrounded by a 15-foot high wall.
[02:17:04.918 --> 02:17:05.439]  In that area.
[02:17:05.479 --> 02:17:08.421]  And a lot of people said it's a center for spies and brainwashing.
[02:17:09.903 --> 02:17:14.787]  So this is an area where they have... This is a mainstream newspaper saying torture, brainwashing, you name it.
[02:17:14.827 --> 02:17:15.308]  From back in 1972.
[02:17:15.768 --> 02:17:17.530]  So you've got this document over here.
[02:17:17.550 --> 02:17:18.411]  That's where they're based now.
[02:17:18.571 --> 02:17:18.731]  Yeah.
[02:17:19.394 --> 02:17:22.256]  And that's the castle that they, uh, what I was able to do some research on.
[02:17:22.276 --> 02:17:26.300]  And so now it's a shadowy federal group that they claim is also does private security.
[02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:30.483]  I guess that's their argument because they're for Bilderberg, but really it's the government doing it.
[02:17:31.384 --> 02:17:33.546]  Uh, and then it's linked back to a torture castle.
[02:17:33.686 --> 02:17:33.866]  Yeah.
[02:17:34.006 --> 02:17:36.528]  So I guess Cobra is probably named after these guys.
[02:17:36.809 --> 02:17:38.430]  They're not naming themselves after Cobra.
[02:17:38.550 --> 02:17:38.750]  Yeah.
[02:17:39.070 --> 02:17:40.332]  I guess we found the real Cobra.
[02:17:40.392 --> 02:17:40.592]  Yeah.
[02:17:41.092 --> 02:17:41.673]  Cobra!
[02:17:42.173 --> 02:17:45.154]  Cobra currency will defeat the press!
[02:17:45.454 --> 02:17:49.256]  How dare you try to film our operations!
[02:17:49.796 --> 02:17:54.198]  I've brought world leaders here to pledge allegiance to Cobra!
[02:17:54.638 --> 02:17:58.559]  The Americans will soon go under TPP control!
[02:17:59.219 --> 02:17:59.560]  Sorry.
[02:18:00.620 --> 02:18:02.120]  We have Rob Dewey on the phone now.
[02:18:02.441 --> 02:18:03.181]  Rob Dewey, go ahead.
[02:18:04.761 --> 02:18:07.022]  Yes, right now they're searching through the car.
[02:18:07.042 --> 02:18:09.603]  This is a full court press.
[02:18:09.643 --> 02:18:11.184]  We haven't been searched like this before.
[02:18:12.964 --> 02:18:18.190]  So, uh, this is, I guess this is what it's like in a free country.
[02:18:18.911 --> 02:18:24.057]  Ask them, say, is Austria free or did it go back under the Soviet Union when we weren't looking?
[02:18:25.378 --> 02:18:26.940]  I think, I think they can hear you now.
[02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:28.002]  I have you on speakerphone.
[02:18:28.732 --> 02:18:30.413]  Attention from the United States!
[02:18:30.493 --> 02:18:35.695]  The world is seeing you engage in police state activities and violating the right of the press.
[02:18:36.076 --> 02:18:37.997]  Your harassment is being duly noted.
[02:18:38.257 --> 02:18:42.179]  You're violating the Geneva Convention and your own federal and state laws.
[02:18:42.839 --> 02:18:45.640]  Guarding the criminal Bilderberg group from the light of day.
[02:18:46.421 --> 02:18:50.463]  We know you've been harassing our reporters and trying to violate their right to gather information.
[02:18:51.343 --> 02:18:55.965]  So I'm here as Alex Jones communicating with you to simply let us engage in the First Amendment.
[02:18:56.265 --> 02:18:57.386]  You know who we are.
[02:18:57.466 --> 02:18:58.886]  You know we don't have criminal records.
[02:18:59.247 --> 02:19:01.908]  You know we simply gather information as legitimate press.
[02:19:02.268 --> 02:19:06.670]  So I would ask you to simply stop harassing our reporters that are trying to do their job.
[02:19:10.472 --> 02:19:12.453]  Why do you do host us?
[02:19:13.093 --> 02:19:14.513]  We do not host you.
[02:19:14.894 --> 02:19:16.875]  We love you from America.
[02:19:18.095 --> 02:19:18.935]  Lots of love.
[02:19:25.624 --> 02:19:29.888]  There's a nice gentleman over here who's hearing everything you're saying and he seems to be nodding in approval.
[02:19:30.668 --> 02:19:34.271]  He probably thinks he's a crazy goblin on the other line.
[02:19:34.291 --> 02:19:35.192]  He wouldn't be too far off.
[02:19:35.953 --> 02:19:38.055]  Anyways, uh, dude, what else is going on now?
[02:19:39.576 --> 02:19:41.337]  Uh, right now they're going through our stuff.
[02:19:41.397 --> 02:19:42.738]  I'm still sitting in the car.
[02:19:43.399 --> 02:19:45.000]  Um, I haven't popped out yet.
[02:19:45.020 --> 02:19:46.061]  They haven't asked me to get out.
[02:19:53.715 --> 02:19:55.996]  Josh is disclosing our locations for them.
[02:19:56.016 --> 02:19:56.917]  We're being all up front.
[02:19:56.997 --> 02:19:58.638]  I've got to skip this network break.
[02:19:58.658 --> 02:20:05.961]  Folks, just support us at nymfowarstore.com, gcmlive.com, because we lose a lot of money when we skip these breaks, but got to do it with our reporters.
[02:20:05.981 --> 02:20:06.702]  They're loud on the ground.
[02:20:06.962 --> 02:20:08.303]  Rob, dude, tell us what else is happening.
[02:20:09.983 --> 02:20:12.905]  So Josh is explaining to them right now where we're staying.
[02:20:14.306 --> 02:20:19.408]  We have fully, uh, they've pulled us over.
[02:20:19.468 --> 02:20:20.249]  We've pulled the car up.
[02:20:20.289 --> 02:20:21.469]  They were looking in the trunk.
[02:20:23.882 --> 02:20:30.567]  I don't know, I think, I think journalism, I don't know, is journalism illegal?
[02:20:32.829 --> 02:20:33.709]  He's not answering me.
[02:20:34.350 --> 02:20:37.112]  Tell him that we want to be his Liebling and his Liebschen.
[02:20:41.535 --> 02:20:42.556]  I think I know what that means.
[02:20:45.950 --> 02:20:48.532]  Yeah, I'm trying to just be nice and give these guys the benefit of the doubt.
[02:20:48.932 --> 02:20:50.093]  Look, we're just press.
[02:20:50.113 --> 02:20:51.834]  They're to cover an international conference.
[02:20:52.215 --> 02:20:53.195]  It's not illegal.
[02:20:53.516 --> 02:20:55.457]  The world is seeing this is a police state.
[02:20:55.998 --> 02:20:57.359]  You've already come to our hotel.
[02:20:57.459 --> 02:21:00.461]  We came to talk to you, but notice they don't talk to us.
[02:21:00.481 --> 02:21:03.603]  They just continue to act like it's dirty and it's bad to cover the press.
[02:21:03.883 --> 02:21:07.766]  Tell them to look up Canada and the firestorm that got started when they arrested me.
[02:21:07.786 --> 02:21:10.508]  I'm going to pop out real quick.
[02:21:10.708 --> 02:21:11.489]  Unless they're done.
[02:21:11.509 --> 02:21:13.150]  Let's see if they're... You can try to.
[02:21:13.170 --> 02:21:15.092]  Well, no, they're probably going to send somebody else over to talk to you now.
[02:21:16.001 --> 02:21:19.163]  Y'all had, um, I don't know who came to our hotel today.
[02:21:19.183 --> 02:21:19.964]  They were looking for me.
[02:21:20.404 --> 02:21:21.585]  We went down to the police station.
[02:21:22.145 --> 02:21:22.446]  Okay.
[02:21:23.266 --> 02:21:25.908]  And, uh, anyway, we're on, uh, live via cell phone now.
[02:21:25.948 --> 02:21:35.295]  It's not video or anything, but they were, um, so basically we're just, we went down to the police station and talked to them and now we're here and I don't know.
[02:21:36.456 --> 02:21:37.717]  We're not trying to mess with anybody.
[02:21:37.737 --> 02:21:39.678]  We just don't want to be messed with doing our job.
[02:21:40.178 --> 02:21:41.719]  That's, that's kind of how we feel.
[02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:42.380]  Thank you.
[02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:42.940]  We're finished.
[02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:43.561]  We're finished.
[02:21:43.761 --> 02:21:44.001]  Okay.
[02:21:44.261 --> 02:21:44.521]  All right.
[02:21:44.561 --> 02:21:45.182]  Y'all have a good day.
[02:21:46.190 --> 02:21:46.551]  Be safe.
[02:21:46.571 --> 02:21:46.871]  Thank you.
[02:21:47.191 --> 02:21:49.914]  Have a good one.
[02:21:50.134 --> 02:21:51.696]  Tell them Hell Cobra.
[02:21:51.716 --> 02:21:54.819]  I'm not going to say Hell Cobra.
[02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:57.181]  Hell Cobra!
[02:21:58.062 --> 02:21:59.384]  Good, good.
[02:21:59.624 --> 02:22:00.305]  Very nice.
[02:22:00.325 --> 02:22:01.065]  Did you like that one?
[02:22:01.105 --> 02:22:02.267]  Yeah.
[02:22:02.907 --> 02:22:06.091]  These guys seem to be... I don't know how the communication is.
[02:22:06.131 --> 02:22:09.374]  They did have... Did they give you our passports back?
[02:22:13.700 --> 02:22:16.062]  Yeah, I think we need our passports and the booking papers.
[02:22:16.082 --> 02:22:16.542]  No, no, no, no.
[02:22:17.463 --> 02:22:18.003]  Oh, no, here they are.
[02:22:18.023 --> 02:22:18.483]  They're back here.
[02:22:19.624 --> 02:22:19.724]  Okay.
[02:22:19.744 --> 02:22:20.505]  Here, we're good.
[02:22:20.805 --> 02:22:21.085]  We're good.
[02:22:21.346 --> 02:22:29.011]  Okay, I just want to make sure they gave us our passports and our... This booking paper, this is probably the most important printout I've ever printed out.
[02:22:29.071 --> 02:22:34.355]  Out of all the printouts I've done at InfoWars, this booking paper has saved our butts many a time.
[02:22:36.738 --> 02:22:40.180]  Just by showing that we're staying up the hill, they allow us to continue.
[02:22:40.780 --> 02:22:43.502]  Well, let's just stop right there.
[02:22:44.382 --> 02:22:47.264]  They would love to stop you, but they know it'll make a major incident.
[02:22:48.004 --> 02:22:51.586]  But let's just stop right there and think about where we are in America and in the world.
[02:22:52.166 --> 02:22:55.468]  There's a globalist meeting of 150 people meeting.
[02:22:55.768 --> 02:22:59.330]  It's already in the British news that it's totalitarian, that it's illegal.
[02:22:59.751 --> 02:23:01.952]  It's in the German news saying it's very suspect.
[02:23:02.611 --> 02:23:12.093]  And they've got checkpoints miles and miles away from a private hotel, checking everybody, three days before it officially kicks off, or now two and a half days.
[02:23:12.374 --> 02:23:16.495]  They've had these checkpoints for over a week and a half, the press reports, in Austria.
[02:23:18.315 --> 02:23:22.216]  This shows the totalitarianism that this group's trying to put out worldwide.
[02:23:22.956 --> 02:23:27.557]  And they're on record, they're the ones behind victim disarmament.
[02:23:27.877 --> 02:23:29.358]  They're the ones behind open borders.
[02:23:30.452 --> 02:23:32.093]  They're the ones behind carbon taxes.
[02:23:32.513 --> 02:23:33.754]  They're the ones behind it all.
[02:23:34.415 --> 02:23:38.977]  And I want you guys to now continue on to your hotel, continue driving on cell phone.
[02:23:38.997 --> 02:23:43.120]  I want to have you co-host with us here from Austria, Rob Dew and Josh Owens.
[02:23:43.180 --> 02:23:46.022]  But first, you have something else to add?
[02:23:47.263 --> 02:23:52.946]  Well, I just want to say, where they have the second new checkpoint now, this is still a through road.
[02:23:53.006 --> 02:23:55.348]  This is not the only road going to the hotel.
[02:23:55.428 --> 02:23:57.209]  They have a spot that they could block off.
[02:23:57.802 --> 02:23:59.963]  That is another three miles up the road here.
[02:24:00.404 --> 02:24:02.405]  That wouldn't bother anybody.
[02:24:02.465 --> 02:24:03.846]  It wouldn't get in anybody's business.
[02:24:03.866 --> 02:24:05.266]  They wouldn't be searching people.
[02:24:05.306 --> 02:24:08.989]  And they would still have plenty of room to set up a security perimeter.
[02:24:09.469 --> 02:24:15.252]  It's not like... But why do they even set it up for a private group that's not important according to our media?
[02:24:15.292 --> 02:24:15.953]  There you go.
[02:24:16.373 --> 02:24:20.055]  Why don't they just have security at the hotel and at its front gate?
[02:24:20.735 --> 02:24:25.018]  It's about harassing everyone so we can't even aim cameras at the building.
[02:24:26.540 --> 02:24:29.822]  Yeah, we can't even get to the... So the media can say it doesn't exist.
[02:24:30.322 --> 02:24:30.762]  Exactly.
[02:24:31.102 --> 02:24:32.963]  So they can play the public like a bunch of idiots.
[02:24:34.204 --> 02:24:43.187]  We've gone to talk to two different police groups, the one downtown, who are very rude to us, and then the ones up here, who I guess just rifle through our stuff.
[02:24:43.207 --> 02:24:45.288]  Josh, what did they actually look through?
[02:24:45.388 --> 02:24:47.029]  They opened up the trunk and everything, right?
[02:24:47.249 --> 02:24:53.952]  They opened up the trunk, they pulled up the lining of the car, and looked underneath the lining of the car.
[02:24:54.594 --> 02:24:56.335]  So we're very dangerous at this point.
[02:24:56.355 --> 02:25:00.217]  This is the most full-body cavity search we've ever had to undergo.
[02:25:00.237 --> 02:25:02.819]  There's a place in the back for a tire and they ripped up the lining under it.
[02:25:03.339 --> 02:25:04.700]  Yeah.
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:09.303]  Guys, we have Paul Watson on the line with an update on what's happening and unfolding.
[02:25:09.323 --> 02:25:11.684]  Then we're going to give you some breaking news on COBRA.
[02:25:11.724 --> 02:25:12.965]  I've got a big article out on it.
[02:25:13.826 --> 02:25:15.447]  Bilderberg claimed it was private security.
[02:25:15.487 --> 02:25:20.850]  No, it's German secret police or Austrian secret police involved in mine control.
[02:25:21.450 --> 02:25:22.431]  This is mainstream news.
[02:25:22.951 --> 02:25:23.672]  In a castle.
[02:25:24.392 --> 02:25:25.333]  Predating G.I.
[02:25:25.393 --> 02:25:26.914]  Joe, villain Cobra.
[02:25:27.334 --> 02:25:29.435]  So, this is probably who Cobra is named after.
[02:25:30.116 --> 02:25:31.917]  We thought it was a joke they were called Cobra.
[02:25:32.337 --> 02:25:33.858]  Again, truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:25:33.958 --> 02:25:39.042]  Usually, it turns out, stuff in fiction is from reality.
[02:25:40.022 --> 02:25:43.504]  Let's get Paul Watson's take, who's still in the UK, in London.
[02:25:43.865 --> 02:25:47.507]  He'll be traveling tomorrow into Austria.
[02:25:47.527 --> 02:25:48.568]  Watson, what do you make of this?
[02:25:51.391 --> 02:25:57.374]  Boys, I mean, the claim that it's illegal to film police in Austria, from what I've read, is complete BS.
[02:25:57.554 --> 02:26:04.957]  I mean, there have been some pretty high-profile cases involving asylum seekers and illegal aliens where it was legal to film police.
[02:26:05.017 --> 02:26:07.158]  So, there's no law against it.
[02:26:07.498 --> 02:26:14.982]  There's something where they can claim copyright against their image later on, but it's not an actual crime to film the police in Austria.
[02:26:15.022 --> 02:26:17.783]  They can only claim the copyright if you're selling something off their image.
[02:26:18.283 --> 02:26:19.565]  Like branding it with him.
[02:26:20.145 --> 02:26:23.329]  Under news gathering, I looked it up too before you guys went.
[02:26:23.850 --> 02:26:24.671]  They can say nothing.
[02:26:26.516 --> 02:26:31.578]  No, so, you know, there's going to be dozens more people filming them there in a couple of days anyway.
[02:26:31.978 --> 02:26:39.221]  And that's, you know, last year in Denmark it was completely different, of course, and that hotel was almost in the city centre.
[02:26:39.261 --> 02:26:43.323]  It was literally, you know, like a mile away from the city centre.
[02:26:43.403 --> 02:26:50.005]  The police met with us before, we could set up right outside the hotel, literally yards from the hotel as all the cars were driving in.
[02:26:50.465 --> 02:26:51.426]  Completely different.
[02:26:52.446 --> 02:26:55.448]  The police arrested provocateurs that were harassing us.
[02:26:55.928 --> 02:26:56.829]  They were pretty nice.
[02:26:58.410 --> 02:27:01.091]  Yeah, the provocateurs were worse than the police.
[02:27:01.411 --> 02:27:04.073]  But in Switzerland, it was a similar geography.
[02:27:04.093 --> 02:27:06.154]  You know, the hotel was halfway up a mountain.
[02:27:06.574 --> 02:27:11.857]  But still, we could literally stand a hundred yards away from the hotel and look directly at it.
[02:27:11.897 --> 02:27:13.558]  There was a huge staging area there.
[02:27:14.138 --> 02:27:18.020]  So the fact that they've got... We could show the black helicopters landing and taking off, everything.
[02:27:18.061 --> 02:27:18.181]  Yeah.
[02:27:18.241 --> 02:27:20.142]  In fact, roll some of the black helicopters, guys.
[02:27:20.162 --> 02:27:20.422]  Go ahead.
[02:27:21.667 --> 02:27:39.001]  So the fact that they've set up these checkpoints six miles away is bizarre because, you know, maybe it's due to the fact that they weren't happy with us last year because literally they were sat out on the patio having lunch in Copenhagen and there was just like a chain link fence separating them.
[02:27:39.021 --> 02:27:43.525]  What about when they open the windows up and like eight guys are basically fondling each other in bathrobes?
[02:27:45.933 --> 02:27:48.233]  Yeah, they were doing that in the hotel window.
[02:27:48.274 --> 02:27:49.474]  It was all very public.
[02:27:49.934 --> 02:27:57.535]  And even though we were literally, you know, less than a stone's throw away from Bilderberg members, there were about four cops in the whole area.
[02:27:57.936 --> 02:28:07.818]  So in comparison to this, where they've got, you know, 2,000 police surrounding this compound, it's completely ridiculous because there are only going to be... Oh my God, I just thought of something!
[02:28:07.898 --> 02:28:11.078]  Google the leader of Cobra Security Austria.
[02:28:11.358 --> 02:28:12.619]  That's Cobra Commander!
[02:28:14.279 --> 02:28:15.700]  I bet he's even wearing a mask!
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:16.440]  I'm sorry, Paul.
[02:28:16.460 --> 02:28:16.840]  Go ahead.
[02:28:18.421 --> 02:28:20.262]  Well, it's just total overkill.
[02:28:20.502 --> 02:28:24.984]  Cobra was created as a reaction to the terrorist attack on the Munich Olympics.
[02:28:25.444 --> 02:28:34.168]  So they're treating, you know, a few dozen... Which, by the way, was staged by the Germans, even at the end of the... one day in September, or whatever the name is.
[02:28:34.708 --> 02:28:35.688]  It won an Academy Award.
[02:28:35.749 --> 02:28:37.469]  It's got... Michael Douglas narrates it.
[02:28:38.610 --> 02:28:43.192]  At the end, they admit that they actually staged the hijacking of the plane to release the terrorists.
[02:28:44.110 --> 02:28:46.191]  Because they'd actually worked for the government the whole time!
[02:28:47.052 --> 02:28:47.532]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:28:49.093 --> 02:28:51.434]  Yeah, so, it's complete overkill.
[02:28:51.634 --> 02:28:55.317]  I mean, there weren't even that many protesters in Copenhagen, it was in the middle of the city.
[02:28:55.677 --> 02:29:03.021]  So there's probably going to be, what, a few dozen bloggers and, quote, protesters who can't even get anywhere near the place when it kicks off.
[02:29:03.061 --> 02:29:06.243]  So, a complete overkill.
[02:29:06.583 --> 02:29:11.146]  5.6 million euros, including the G7, for this joint operation.
[02:29:11.586 --> 02:29:12.847]  Taxpayer funded.
[02:29:13.467 --> 02:29:14.768]  That can't be justified.
[02:29:14.828 --> 02:29:16.128]  Completely ridiculous.
[02:29:16.748 --> 02:29:25.492]  But again, Bilderberg claims that it's a charity, and in fact the UK gave it charity status, even though it's a bunch of private individuals.
[02:29:25.512 --> 02:29:31.595]  Let me ask you this, Paul, and we're going to go to break, come back with everybody here, Joe Biggs, yourself, Paul Watson, and the crew there on the ground.
[02:29:32.645 --> 02:29:36.328]  I want to ask you what you're going to be trying to focus on when you get there, what you expect to happen.
[02:29:36.348 --> 02:29:42.915]  I also want to ask you, why do you think England had 3,000-plus people at once demonstrating against it, but the U.S.
[02:29:42.995 --> 02:29:44.316]  or anywhere else, you can't get that?
[02:29:44.336 --> 02:29:45.817]  I mean, that says something about the U.K.
[02:29:45.857 --> 02:29:47.499]  folks, that they're more awake, I think.
[02:29:49.522 --> 02:29:51.724]  Oh yeah, I mean, that's it, that's it.
[02:29:51.864 --> 02:29:57.268]  I mean, you get, what, a few hundred when it's in Chantilly, but nowhere near like it was in Watford.
[02:29:57.548 --> 02:29:59.069]  I want to ask you that question when we come back.
[02:29:59.109 --> 02:30:00.830]  Stay there, we'll talk about Cobra Commander.
[02:30:00.990 --> 02:30:02.311]  Find out the name of the leader.
[02:30:02.351 --> 02:30:02.872]  Cobra.
[02:30:03.252 --> 02:30:05.914]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:11.195 --> 02:30:18.504]  Fresh off reports that their acting head resigned because of a 96% failure rate, the TSA is in the news once again.
[02:30:18.524 --> 02:30:24.751]  This time with a notice that 73 of its own employees were flagged for terrorism.
[02:30:25.612 --> 02:30:29.376]  I guess the hiring managers skipped the class on how to read people's minds.
[02:30:30.177 --> 02:30:40.721]  Now, to be fair, the agency may be confused on what a terrorist actually is when they're being ordered to give VIP treatment to the Muslim Brotherhood, a known terrorist organization.
[02:30:41.441 --> 02:30:45.183]  The terrorist distinction came after the group bombed an Egyptian police department.
[02:30:45.743 --> 02:30:50.345]  Also, there have been numerous examples of TSA putting innocent people on watch lists.
[02:30:51.383 --> 02:30:57.767]  Small children having the red flag of a terrorist because they simply share the same name of a known offender.
[02:30:58.828 --> 02:31:04.391]  The agency is in need of long overdue reform, if not outright abolishment.
[02:31:04.912 --> 02:31:08.534]  You can find more reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[02:31:10.214 --> 02:31:15.216]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[02:33:02.868 --> 02:33:03.809]  We're all living in America!
[02:33:03.829 --> 02:33:03.969]  America!
[02:33:03.989 --> 02:33:04.549]  It's wunderbar!
[02:33:04.569 --> 02:33:05.230]  We're all living in America!
[02:33:51.812 --> 02:34:04.488]  We've got Rammstein from Deutschland bringing us in today because we're now in Austria, the imperial capital of what was connected to Germany, and where our little baby Hitler came from.
[02:34:07.162 --> 02:34:14.625]  And we've got our reporters there who have had the police put their hands on their guns, act very hateful, bug their eyes out at them, come to their hotel.
[02:34:15.025 --> 02:34:19.267]  Now they're not acting as rude because we're going and getting in their faces.
[02:34:19.407 --> 02:34:20.147]  We're not being mean.
[02:34:20.507 --> 02:34:21.487]  We're just, hey, we're here.
[02:34:21.808 --> 02:34:22.688]  We're just journalists.
[02:34:23.048 --> 02:34:23.908]  Are you a free country?
[02:34:24.589 --> 02:34:25.369]  We come in peace.
[02:34:25.829 --> 02:34:30.451]  In fact, do from now on just say, we come in peace from America.
[02:34:30.591 --> 02:34:33.252]  And seriously, you know, we come in peace.
[02:34:34.776 --> 02:34:39.638]  And we're just here to cover the criminal group meeting that wants to destroy our sovereignty.
[02:34:39.678 --> 02:34:40.738]  This is just self-defense.
[02:34:41.498 --> 02:34:42.639]  You can look up who we are.
[02:34:43.599 --> 02:34:44.399]  We're not criminals.
[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:46.600]  We work with Alex Jones, Infowars.
[02:34:46.620 --> 02:34:47.560]  They already have all that.
[02:34:48.021 --> 02:34:48.401]  You are up to?
[02:34:48.421 --> 02:34:48.481]  Out!
[02:34:48.501 --> 02:34:48.881]  No filming!
[02:34:52.442 --> 02:35:01.207]  But Joe Biggs wants to get into some of the military angle before I go back to Paul and you guys, dealing with this COBRA group, who the media earlier said, oh, private security.
[02:35:01.528 --> 02:35:02.228]  They're not private.
[02:35:02.268 --> 02:35:12.294]  It's the Ministry of the Interior, and it's made out of the anti-terror unit from the Munich games back in the 70s, in 1978.
[02:35:13.154 --> 02:35:18.738]  Well, if you watch one day in September that won an Academy Award, they admit at the end of the movie that it was a false flag.
[02:35:19.554 --> 02:35:23.396]  And that they staged a hijacking to release the supposed bombers.
[02:35:25.817 --> 02:35:30.799]  I mean, this is the group that ran false flag of the attack on the Munich Olympics.
[02:35:31.379 --> 02:35:33.440]  There is no end to this.
[02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:34.601]  They're certainly connected.
[02:35:34.801 --> 02:35:45.346]  Then you pull up a mainstream newspaper article, you folks, the headline of Joe Biggs, that says it's connected to mine control in a castle in the countryside outside Vienna at their command base.
[02:35:45.626 --> 02:35:47.007]  Yeah, this is from January 30th of 1972.
[02:35:47.548 --> 02:35:51.211]  Schönau Castle is a mystery to Viennese.
[02:35:51.591 --> 02:36:03.000]  Like I said, it is this giant six-room castle in a 70-acre wooded park with 15-foot high walls and that people said that this was a center for spies and brainwashing.
[02:36:03.100 --> 02:36:04.522]  And that's the Boca Raton news.
[02:36:06.383 --> 02:36:08.545]  So... So this thing is news in Florida?
[02:36:09.025 --> 02:36:09.205]  Yeah.
[02:36:09.986 --> 02:36:10.587]  And then you've got
[02:36:11.522 --> 02:36:15.967]  The Cobra Commander group that are... We're still trying to find out who the commander of it is.
[02:36:16.367 --> 02:36:19.050]  The leader of the Ministry of the Interior is a woman, maybe that's why he wears a mask.
[02:36:19.811 --> 02:36:20.391]  She's on screen.
[02:36:20.711 --> 02:36:21.672]  There's Cobra Commander.
[02:36:21.712 --> 02:36:25.697]  Actually, she's actually not the commander of the units, but she's the overall commander.
[02:36:25.877 --> 02:36:31.222]  That's why Cobra Commander usually wears a mask, because she knows that people don't really want to follow a woman in combat.
[02:36:31.643 --> 02:36:34.525]  That's why he speaks in that voice like that, because it's really a woman.
[02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:37.062]  There you go, there's Cobra Commander, sorry.
[02:36:37.803 --> 02:36:41.908]  So yeah, these guys are much like our FBI, and what has our FBI done before?
[02:36:42.028 --> 02:36:50.880]  Staged events, plant evidence to arrest people, and that's one of my biggest fears for some of these guys, you know, the reporters over there right now.
[02:36:51.460 --> 02:37:03.606]  When they leave their hotel rooms I would encourage you guys when you go back every time to search that place to make sure nothing's being planted because of the reason they're being so hostile towards you and stopping you non-stop and you know and just being rude.
[02:37:04.026 --> 02:37:15.012]  I would make sure that you would be checking those rooms every time you go back so they don't plan something so they can come in and all of a sudden say oh we need to come in and perform a search and then they've got something there that they can kind of get you with.
[02:37:15.032 --> 02:37:16.653]  I think that's a great point.
[02:37:16.673 --> 02:37:18.273]  I'm going back to Paul Watson in a moment.
[02:37:20.902 --> 02:37:24.084]  But let's get a comment from Rob Dew and Josh Owens.
[02:37:25.505 --> 02:37:30.608]  Well, I'm actually checking every orifice in the kitchen right now to make sure there's nothing hidden.
[02:37:31.509 --> 02:37:34.791]  Because, yeah, I am taking that advice to heart.
[02:37:35.251 --> 02:37:38.033]  You need to check Henry Kissinger's orifice for the Constitution.
[02:37:38.613 --> 02:37:39.413]  Maybe where it's hidden.
[02:37:40.754 --> 02:37:43.636]  I think when they come up upon me next time, I'll try this.
[02:37:43.936 --> 02:37:44.196]  Oh, wait.
[02:37:44.256 --> 02:37:44.997]  Put your weapon.
[02:37:45.137 --> 02:37:46.218]  I mean you no harm.
[02:37:46.898 --> 02:37:48.039]  I think I'll try that.
[02:37:52.118 --> 02:37:55.762]  Maybe they'll, maybe that'll like lighten the mood because these guys are so serious.
[02:37:56.403 --> 02:38:00.207]  Like I'm wearing a blazer, you know, I'm wearing a blazer.
[02:38:00.227 --> 02:38:02.550]  I have a ball cap on, I'm wearing glasses.
[02:38:03.591 --> 02:38:06.454]  You know, I'm not, I'm not carrying any weapons.
[02:38:07.315 --> 02:38:08.777]  You know, I have, I have a camera.
[02:38:09.017 --> 02:38:10.839]  I have several cameras and that's it.
[02:38:12.038 --> 02:38:14.240]  All we're armed with is the truth, and that's all we can do.
[02:38:14.701 --> 02:38:26.250]  And it's just amazing, you know, having that little confrontation with the cop yesterday, who was trying to justify what they were doing, and saying, we do this for you if you have a party and there's a break-in.
[02:38:26.531 --> 02:38:34.417]  No, you don't set up a five-mile checkpoint in front of my party and have 2,000 cops running around my property if I'm having a party.
[02:38:34.437 --> 02:38:38.221]  For an organization, the New York Times and Rush Limbaugh says doesn't exist.
[02:38:38.951 --> 02:38:40.412]  That sounds like a McKinney Pool party.
[02:38:40.432 --> 02:38:44.254]  Can I hear from Yoda one more time about... because I interrupted Yoda earlier.
[02:38:44.274 --> 02:38:47.075]  Away put your weapon.
[02:38:47.235 --> 02:38:48.315]  I mean you no harm.
[02:38:49.776 --> 02:38:50.737]  That's really good.
[02:38:50.757 --> 02:38:53.998]  Nothing to see here at all.
[02:38:54.018 --> 02:38:55.879]  Hello Mr. Penguin.
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:38:57.720]  Hello Mr. Penguin.
[02:39:01.164 --> 02:39:01.944]  Oh my goodness.
[02:39:02.485 --> 02:39:04.665]  Well the thing is, they're working for the terrorists.
[02:39:05.106 --> 02:39:06.046]  Everyone knows it.
[02:39:06.306 --> 02:39:07.606]  They have to act like we're bad.
[02:39:07.646 --> 02:39:13.268]  It's why they SWAT team Amish people in two-year investigations over them selling a neighbor cheese.
[02:39:13.289 --> 02:39:18.530]  Because it's not illegal, but they have to show the jury, look, we SWAT teamed them.
[02:39:18.690 --> 02:39:19.591]  It's all theater.
[02:39:20.231 --> 02:39:20.671]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:39:20.711 --> 02:39:23.392]  Well, it's amazing how they say they're going to be a private security group.
[02:39:23.472 --> 02:39:27.593]  Meanwhile, right here, it says Austrian Federal Police.
[02:39:27.873 --> 02:39:29.014]  And what magazine is that out of?
[02:39:29.554 --> 02:39:31.654]  This was from a magazine.
[02:39:31.694 --> 02:39:32.375]  Let me see.
[02:39:33.415 --> 02:39:36.576]  This one, it's called Cobra Austria Special Police Commandos.
[02:39:38.336 --> 02:39:38.937]  Law and Order.
[02:39:39.877 --> 02:39:41.037]  So it's a law enforcement magazine.
[02:39:41.057 --> 02:39:41.417]  Here, here.
[02:39:41.457 --> 02:39:42.658]  Lawandordermag.com.
[02:39:42.958 --> 02:39:43.518]  Let's look at it.
[02:39:43.538 --> 02:39:46.659]  And they don't even have real photos of themselves.
[02:39:46.739 --> 02:39:49.600]  It's like artist renderings of them doing heroic deeds.
[02:39:52.571 --> 02:39:55.353]  And again, folks, it's not just us covering Bilderberg.
[02:39:56.494 --> 02:39:58.036]  This is how the media operates.
[02:39:58.116 --> 02:39:59.297]  It's how the police operate.
[02:39:59.617 --> 02:40:01.699]  These are microcosms of the larger world.
[02:40:01.759 --> 02:40:02.599]  Sorry, go ahead, Yoda.
[02:40:05.102 --> 02:40:10.306]  I was just saying, they pride themselves on their mountaineering skills, the Cobra guys.
[02:40:10.426 --> 02:40:14.289]  They always compete in these mountaineering competitions and they always place in the top two or three.
[02:40:14.309 --> 02:40:19.854]  You know, these are the elite of the elite of, you know, of these special forces.
[02:40:20.538 --> 02:40:24.744]  And it just makes me wonder why they need to be here for, you know, like you said, an event that doesn't exist.
[02:40:25.084 --> 02:40:25.785]  There's at least 24 of them here.
[02:40:27.483 --> 02:40:34.389]  Yeah, I was looking at the map, too, and there's an area where it forks and goes into a single road that goes up into the hotel.
[02:40:34.429 --> 02:40:40.734]  They could easily just block off that one area, that entrance, and then allow traffic to move freely throughout that area.
[02:40:40.794 --> 02:40:46.639]  Meanwhile, you're six miles back and a complete and total police state going through God knows how many checkpoints today.
[02:40:46.659 --> 02:40:48.320]  I mean, how many checkpoints have you had to go through today?
[02:40:48.340 --> 02:40:50.042]  This will only draw more attention on it.
[02:40:50.522 --> 02:40:52.123]  I mean, that's what's going to happen here.
[02:40:53.775 --> 02:41:06.384]  Right, and everybody I talked, well not everybody I talked to, probably 4 out of the 5 people that I talked to down there in the town, we talked about 20 people, but probably 4 or 5 of them said yeah they had to go through a checkpoint and they thought it was weird.
[02:41:06.824 --> 02:41:11.888]  One guy was like yeah we had to go through them 3 times, we're just going up to the lake to hang out and we gotta go through a checkpoint every time.
[02:41:12.608 --> 02:41:18.112]  They're being citizens, they just have to flash an ID and go through, but they still have to wait if they're pulling somebody else over.
[02:41:18.232 --> 02:41:26.677]  We saw a group of journalists, I assume they were journalists, one of them looked like he was one of those camera guys who carries the giant camera on his shoulder, one of those ENG cameras.
[02:41:27.424 --> 02:41:29.205]  And they looked like they were from Europe.
[02:41:29.245 --> 02:41:30.806]  They were all in this really small car.
[02:41:30.846 --> 02:41:33.007]  They had them pulled off to the side as we were coming down.
[02:41:33.067 --> 02:41:34.688]  I took a couple photos of them.
[02:41:35.048 --> 02:41:36.469]  And they turned those guys away.
[02:41:37.349 --> 02:41:38.330]  Not like them they did.
[02:41:38.510 --> 02:41:38.870]  No.
[02:41:39.511 --> 02:41:44.793]  Make them leave.
[02:41:45.614 --> 02:41:50.937]  Not proper credentials you carry.
[02:41:51.177 --> 02:41:51.757]  Mine!
[02:41:51.817 --> 02:41:52.097]  Mine!
[02:41:52.117 --> 02:41:52.718]  Mine!
[02:41:53.018 --> 02:41:54.339]  Or I will help you not do that one.
[02:41:54.379 --> 02:41:54.679]  Mine!
[02:41:54.779 --> 02:41:55.039]  Mine!
[02:41:56.468 --> 02:41:56.768]  Mine!
[02:41:56.928 --> 02:41:57.788]  Or I hope you're not!
[02:42:01.050 --> 02:42:04.631]  So they turned this group away and they just looked like normal dudes.
[02:42:04.691 --> 02:42:06.752]  They had shorts and polo shirts on.
[02:42:06.772 --> 02:42:11.413]  It looked like they were just coming up here to cover the event and they didn't have the proper paperwork, I guess, to get through.
[02:42:11.433 --> 02:42:18.196]  So that's what's going on here in Austria and we're giving people the real news.
[02:42:18.576 --> 02:42:21.277]  I've seen reports that we're sensationalists
[02:42:22.217 --> 02:42:23.998]  Uh, that we come and cover this, but you know what?
[02:42:24.558 --> 02:42:32.302]  If you're going to agree and think that this is reasonable to have checkpoints five, six miles away from an event, I mean, that you're just going to accept this?
[02:42:32.322 --> 02:42:33.863]  Listen, this is how they spin stuff.
[02:42:34.223 --> 02:42:38.065]  First they said it didn't exist, now they're setting up planetary government openly.
[02:42:38.866 --> 02:42:43.388]  We're going under TPP, the EU's a dictatorship, a Nazi project on record.
[02:42:44.108 --> 02:42:44.969]  It was covert.
[02:42:45.129 --> 02:42:47.050]  The UK's trying to get out right now.
[02:42:47.490 --> 02:42:49.751]  The globalists are setting up a global meltdown.
[02:42:49.771 --> 02:42:50.512]  The elite are moving.
[02:42:51.292 --> 02:42:57.313]  Yeah, the government security people run a mind control torture castle according to the Bogarton Times.
[02:42:57.773 --> 02:43:03.515]  I mean, you cannot make this stuff up and then the media spends it that we're sensational.
[02:43:03.575 --> 02:43:06.255]  No, reality is sensational.
[02:43:06.375 --> 02:43:06.835]  Exactly.
[02:43:07.035 --> 02:43:07.535]  And guess what?
[02:43:07.655 --> 02:43:08.276]  We're winning.
[02:43:08.676 --> 02:43:09.036]  Guess what?
[02:43:09.156 --> 02:43:09.796]  We're winning.
[02:43:10.076 --> 02:43:11.536]  We're having a good time doing it.
[02:43:12.136 --> 02:43:14.697]  And you've got a bunch of people who want to power grab and take over.
[02:43:14.917 --> 02:43:18.298]  And that's why Germany and Austria were involved staging the Munich attack.
[02:43:18.678 --> 02:43:19.298]  It's come out.
[02:43:20.058 --> 02:43:22.580]  So decades later, they can run around and harass journalists.
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:28.684]  Just like the Patriot Act's used on its number one enemy, veterans, like Joe Biggs, who's on a don't-treat list at the VA.
[02:43:28.964 --> 02:43:29.805]  We know what's going on.
[02:43:29.825 --> 02:43:31.626]  I want to get Paul Watson's take on all this.
[02:43:32.087 --> 02:43:43.855]  Paul, a secret government group called COBRA that's in a mine control castle, running security at Bilderberg, that acts like Spectre, I mean, you really can't make this up.
[02:43:45.694 --> 02:44:04.141]  Well the thing about it is, they try and make you feel guilty, like you're bad for wanting to cover this as a reporter or film the police or whatever, when they're literally guarding a conference run by a war criminal in Henry Kissinger, attended by three of the top people from HSBC.
[02:44:04.761 --> 02:44:14.668]  Who recently got fined again for a second time $43 million for laundering money for drug dealers and arms dealers.
[02:44:15.028 --> 02:44:20.552]  And yet we're the bad people for wanting to cover this and yet that's what's taking place at Bilderberg.
[02:44:21.052 --> 02:44:25.055]  And what they're discussing at Bilderberg is more capital controls.
[02:44:25.095 --> 02:44:32.239]  The move towards the abolition of cash in the name of preventing tax fraud and terror financing to ISIS.
[02:44:34.801 --> 02:44:37.965]  What they admit is in their agenda, the drugs linked to yesterday.
[02:44:38.426 --> 02:44:42.891]  Let's go over what they admit is in their agenda and then what our sources say is also there.
[02:44:42.911 --> 02:44:45.895]  Because they're trying to sew the planet up right now.
[02:44:45.915 --> 02:44:49.820]  A. B. They've got to be mad because it's already all over the European and British press.
[02:44:50.220 --> 02:44:51.542]  It is not in the U.S.
[02:44:51.602 --> 02:44:52.543]  press as usual.
[02:44:52.563 --> 02:44:53.144]  Go ahead.
[02:44:54.619 --> 02:45:03.645]  Well, what they admit is in the agenda is basically meaningless because it's just a series of vague talking points like, you know, United Kingdom means absolutely nothing.
[02:45:04.186 --> 02:45:14.253]  So what they're actually talking about from what they've said and from the information we've got is, and this is why Regina Duggan from Google is there, this is why the guy from Google DeepMind is there,
[02:45:14.933 --> 02:45:19.537]  Selling artificial intelligence and Big Brother surveillance as trendy and cool.
[02:45:19.677 --> 02:45:33.009]  That's what they've been working on for the past couple of years with this ingestible ID chip, which Regina Duggan, who of course is the former director of DARPA, now a Google executive, that's what she's working towards.
[02:45:33.409 --> 02:45:37.693]  She's in attendance at Bilderberg for the first time with Google's Eric Schmidt.
[02:45:38.894 --> 02:45:40.515]  Sorry, Yoda was popping in.
[02:45:41.016 --> 02:45:42.297]  This is real dark side stuff.
[02:45:44.346 --> 02:45:59.459]  Yeah, so they're basically going to come out and say, in the name of stopping ISIS, which now the Pentagon's leaked report said they knew they were creating a Salafist principality in the region by arming all these jihadist groups, but never mind that.
[02:45:59.679 --> 02:46:05.061]  In the name of stopping ISIS, they're going to impose more capital controls on individuals.
[02:46:05.521 --> 02:46:10.863]  So France from September is already banning cash transactions over 1,000 euros.
[02:46:11.203 --> 02:46:21.067]  That's what Bilderberg's going to talk about, because the very people there are allied with the institutions and the voices that are talking about abolishing cash altogether, eventually.
[02:46:23.227 --> 02:46:24.168]  It's over the top!
[02:46:25.826 --> 02:46:26.646]  I just want to add one thing.
[02:46:26.666 --> 02:46:31.768]  There's another company, the head of Siemens Corp is going to be here, and they're one of the most corrupt companies in Europe.
[02:46:31.848 --> 02:46:34.949]  They've been fined over a billion dollars in corruption scandals.
[02:46:35.509 --> 02:46:38.170]  I mean, it's nothing but corrupt individuals.
[02:46:38.210 --> 02:46:46.332]  Well, these are the very same megabanks I showed last hour just fined 5.8 billion dollars for fixing the global
[02:46:47.785 --> 02:46:53.969]  Money systems, the currency speculation market every day, that is a fraction of what they make per day.
[02:46:54.430 --> 02:47:00.934]  Deutsche Bank hit with largest ever LIBOR fine a few years ago, where all the big banks got caught fixing global interest rates.
[02:47:01.655 --> 02:47:04.077]  I mean, everything is rigged, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:04.557 --> 02:47:06.738]  Even the Rolling Stone magazine admits that.
[02:47:07.119 --> 02:47:10.021]  And all we're doing is showing you who's rigging it.
[02:47:10.441 --> 02:47:12.983]  The giant demonic possum, Henry Kissinger.
[02:47:13.223 --> 02:47:16.116]  The guy from Palantir is there too, that large data mining company.
[02:47:16.578 --> 02:47:17.702]  That's tied in with the NSA?
[02:47:17.723 --> 02:47:17.903]  Yep.
[02:47:18.772 --> 02:47:24.315]  And they have three individuals from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
[02:47:24.475 --> 02:47:29.897]  And if people don't know that, this group was created during World War I. Exactly!
[02:47:30.718 --> 02:47:35.760]  Their first act was to write a letter to Woodrow Wilson to say, hey, keep World War I going.
[02:47:35.820 --> 02:47:38.382]  We need this so we can change America fundamentally.
[02:47:38.422 --> 02:47:39.782]  And create a League of Nations.
[02:47:39.822 --> 02:47:40.663]  That's right.
[02:47:40.983 --> 02:47:41.523]  Exactly.
[02:47:42.103 --> 02:47:43.684]  And so they're going up there.
[02:47:43.704 --> 02:47:46.726]  The Carnegie Endowment helped set up the Bolsheviks.
[02:47:47.486 --> 02:47:53.867]  The Carney Endowment helped put the Bolsheviks in that caused the Reign of Terror that killed over 100 million people.
[02:47:54.648 --> 02:47:55.808]  I mean, these are evil folks, folks.
[02:47:55.828 --> 02:47:58.428]  Their job is to figure out how to whitewash World War III.
[02:47:58.748 --> 02:48:00.289]  How to turn it into something we need.
[02:48:00.849 --> 02:48:04.310]  That's why they have these... Wait a minute, are you being discriminatory against World War III now, Rob?
[02:48:04.330 --> 02:48:07.410]  I mean, I've heard a lot of extremism, but don't go that far.
[02:48:08.831 --> 02:48:10.651]  This guy's racist against World War III.
[02:48:10.811 --> 02:48:13.852]  He's racist, he's sexist... World War III is going to affect Europe first.
[02:48:13.932 --> 02:48:15.352]  It's not going to affect the United States.
[02:48:16.437 --> 02:48:18.659]  I mean, unless it goes nuclear, and then everybody's dead.
[02:48:18.679 --> 02:48:27.908]  But, you know, they've got CEOs of media corporations in Denmark, Italy, Austria, Germany, Turkey, the United States.
[02:48:28.188 --> 02:48:29.690]  The head of Bloomberg's going to be here.
[02:48:29.710 --> 02:48:33.153]  But some of the deeper... And figure out how to whitewash it.
[02:48:33.213 --> 02:48:35.395]  Some of the deeper mind shafts.
[02:48:35.815 --> 02:48:37.817]  Life could be quite easily continued.
[02:48:38.318 --> 02:48:41.361]  Animals would have to be bred and slaughtered.
[02:48:43.223 --> 02:48:44.444]  Sorry, that's a Dr. Strangelove.
[02:48:44.564 --> 02:48:47.065]  Can you guys pull up Dr. Strangelove, Mineshaft?
[02:48:48.206 --> 02:48:49.707]  Just type Dr. Strangelove, Mineshaft.
[02:48:49.727 --> 02:48:49.987]  Go ahead.
[02:48:50.267 --> 02:48:50.467]  Sorry.
[02:48:51.307 --> 02:48:54.109]  Yeah, I don't think we're going to stay here the night at this place.
[02:48:54.189 --> 02:48:57.311]  I think I'm going to go down and get a hotel or a room at the other hotel.
[02:48:58.095 --> 02:48:59.456]  Um, just for tonight.
[02:48:59.716 --> 02:49:07.338]  I just don't feel, especially after coming here, and then the guy, the hotel manager said, don't be alarmed if they come at night.
[02:49:07.918 --> 02:49:09.639]  I'm definitely going to be alarmed if they come at night.
[02:49:09.659 --> 02:49:15.001]  Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, you can do whatever you want as a family man, you know, with three kids and one in the oven.
[02:49:15.541 --> 02:49:19.382]  You can do whatever you want, but I'm telling you, you want them to come.
[02:49:19.442 --> 02:49:20.503]  They're watching right now.
[02:49:21.323 --> 02:49:24.327]  If you know Dracula's coming at night, that's great!
[02:49:24.427 --> 02:49:26.769]  Be waiting on him, and get it all on tape!
[02:49:27.110 --> 02:49:28.752]  Nighttime raid on journalists?
[02:49:28.952 --> 02:49:30.313]  Sensational!
[02:49:30.914 --> 02:49:33.036]  So tell us the rest of the story.
[02:49:33.497 --> 02:49:36.781]  You were told by the hotel owner, don't be surprised if they come at night.
[02:49:36.801 --> 02:49:39.524]  I mean, what are they going to do, drag you away to Auschwitz?
[02:49:40.987 --> 02:49:42.769]  He said, don't worry if they come at night.
[02:49:42.829 --> 02:49:43.749]  He said, don't be alarmed.
[02:49:43.810 --> 02:49:49.114]  Actually, he said, don't be alarmed if they come at night because he goes, they'll probably come back later because they asked him, you're going to be back.
[02:49:49.174 --> 02:49:50.555]  And I said, I don't, you know, I said, I don't know.
[02:49:50.576 --> 02:49:51.316]  We're down in the town.
[02:49:51.336 --> 02:49:52.257]  We're shooting some reports.
[02:49:53.018 --> 02:49:57.382]  And the last thing he said was, well, don't be alarmed if they come back tonight, but I'll see you in the morning.
[02:49:57.402 --> 02:49:59.523]  That was just a little creepy.
[02:50:00.344 --> 02:50:02.226]  Set up a GoPro outside and have that thing running.
[02:50:04.301 --> 02:50:04.581]  Yeah.
[02:50:04.601 --> 02:50:04.861]  100 years?
[02:50:04.881 --> 02:50:05.782]  That's the problem.
[02:50:05.802 --> 02:50:06.843]  There's batteries on everything.
[02:50:06.863 --> 02:50:07.383]  Hold on, hold on.
[02:50:07.403 --> 02:50:11.786]  We've got a comment here from the... People could actually stay down there for 100 years?
[02:50:12.166 --> 02:50:13.647]  Would not be difficult, my dear.
[02:50:14.228 --> 02:50:16.309]  Nuclear reactors could... Heh.
[02:50:16.609 --> 02:50:17.770]  I'm sorry, Mr. President.
[02:50:17.790 --> 02:50:22.133]  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely.
[02:50:22.914 --> 02:50:24.975]  Greenhouses could maintain plant life.
[02:50:25.936 --> 02:50:28.137]  Animals could be bred and slaughtered.
[02:50:28.157 --> 02:50:33.361]  A quick survey would have to be made of all the available mine sites in the country.
[02:50:33.968 --> 02:50:41.454]  But I would guess that a dwelling space for several hundred thousand of our people could easily be provided.
[02:50:41.474 --> 02:50:47.039]  Well, I... I would hate to have to decide who stays up and who goes down.
[02:50:47.740 --> 02:50:47.900]  Good.
[02:50:48.220 --> 02:50:50.082]  That would not be necessary, Mr. President.
[02:50:51.823 --> 02:50:53.925]  Could easily be accomplished with a computer.
[02:50:54.726 --> 02:50:59.490]  And the computer could be set and programmed to accept letters from youth, health,
[02:51:00.394 --> 02:51:05.519]  Sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills.
[02:51:05.919 --> 02:51:08.061]  Of course, it would be absolutely valuable.
[02:51:08.201 --> 02:51:10.063]  Oh, we'll come back with the best part.
[02:51:10.543 --> 02:51:11.644]  Honey, it's time for dinner.
[02:51:12.345 --> 02:51:13.766]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[02:51:14.206 --> 02:51:15.488]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[02:51:15.708 --> 02:51:16.829]  Mine is falling apart.
[02:51:17.209 --> 02:51:23.034]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[02:51:23.414 --> 02:51:26.217]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[02:51:26.637 --> 02:51:27.158]  What is that?
[02:51:27.458 --> 02:51:36.546]  Well, apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[02:51:36.986 --> 02:51:45.393]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[02:51:45.714 --> 02:51:46.034]  Wow!
[02:51:46.334 --> 02:51:47.255]  That sounds scary.
[02:51:47.655 --> 02:51:51.999]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold shielded wallet.
[02:51:52.099 --> 02:51:52.920]  Are they more expensive?
[02:51:53.360 --> 02:51:53.581]  No.
[02:51:53.861 --> 02:52:01.131]  In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from idstronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[02:52:01.552 --> 02:52:02.393]  Sounds great!
[02:52:02.754 --> 02:52:05.358]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[02:52:05.378 --> 02:52:09.443]  I want to be protected, and these wallets at idstronghold.com look fantastic!
[02:52:10.234 --> 02:52:14.977]  Alex Jones here with Infowarslife.com Consumer Alert Report.
[02:52:15.397 --> 02:52:22.442]  Many of you are aware that around the world most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[02:52:22.722 --> 02:52:30.487]  The good news is our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[02:52:30.787 --> 02:52:31.788]  The bad news is
[02:52:32.108 --> 02:52:39.390]  For the first time in more than a year, supplies at Infowarslife.com of Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine are running low.
[02:52:39.770 --> 02:52:44.171]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these Deep Earth Crystals.
[02:52:44.571 --> 02:52:51.733]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary and only available to Infowarslife.com.
[02:52:51.933 --> 02:52:54.834]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[02:52:55.054 --> 02:53:01.743]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[02:53:02.044 --> 02:53:06.049]  Available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:53:10.567 --> 02:53:17.409]  If you're worried about your health, and you're tired of the nasty side effects of harsh drugs or antibiotics, look no further.
[02:53:17.849 --> 02:53:19.949]  Supernatural Silver is the answer.
[02:53:20.669 --> 02:53:29.832]  Supernatural Silver is a powerful immune system enhancer that can be used every day to help keep you healthy and well, with none of those nasty side effects.
[02:53:30.392 --> 02:53:39.114]  It's extremely safe for use internally as well as topically, and Supernatural Silver is hundreds of times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver.
[02:53:39.534 --> 02:53:44.197]  It is perfect for use in the sinuses, eyes, ears, and on any wound or skin issue.
[02:53:44.557 --> 02:53:54.164]  Supernatural Silver is also extremely effective when taken orally and can help fight off bacteria, viruses, and mold that may be overwhelming your immune system.

[02:54:12.616 --> 02:54:25.805]  It's a practice from youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills.
[02:54:25.825 --> 02:54:36.853]  Of course, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included to foster and impart the required principles of leadership and tradition
[02:54:43.647 --> 02:54:45.908]  Actually, they would breed prodigiously, eh?
[02:54:46.629 --> 02:54:49.230]  There would be much time and little to do.
[02:54:50.991 --> 02:55:04.979]  But with the proper breeding techniques and a ratio of, say, 10 females to each male, I would guess that they could then work their way back to the present gross national product within, say, 20 years.
[02:55:06.399 --> 02:55:12.883]  But look here, Doctor, wouldn't this nucleus of survivors be so grief-stricken and anguished that they
[02:55:15.308 --> 02:55:17.150]  Envy the dead and not want to go on living?
[02:55:18.171 --> 02:55:18.611]  No, sir.
[02:55:19.272 --> 02:55:20.153]  Excuse me.
[02:55:27.887 --> 02:55:32.232]  George C. Scott jumps up and says, Mr. President, we must not allow a mine shaft gap.
[02:55:32.793 --> 02:55:35.075]  So they've already started nuclear war that's beginning in minutes.
[02:55:35.336 --> 02:55:37.719]  The missiles are already being fired both directions, the bombers.
[02:55:38.559 --> 02:55:40.482]  And they're just busy thinking about how they're going to get their tunnels.
[02:55:40.502 --> 02:55:45.688]  The elite today are actually getting their bunkers, their tunnels ready, running to New Zealand.
[02:55:46.949 --> 02:55:51.592]  I was told by Hollywood Insiders like a year before it was announced that James Cameron thought this was all coming and left.
[02:55:52.152 --> 02:55:53.253]  People made jokes about that.
[02:55:54.534 --> 02:55:55.875]  By the way, I shouldn't make jokes.
[02:55:56.235 --> 02:55:56.775]  I do the show.
[02:55:56.815 --> 02:55:58.036]  This is really scary stuff.
[02:55:58.076 --> 02:55:58.937]  It's very saddening.
[02:55:59.277 --> 02:56:00.938]  I was very serious the first hour or two.
[02:56:00.958 --> 02:56:05.421]  I start making jokes at some point because we make light of this.
[02:56:05.501 --> 02:56:09.163]  And even the crew, my cousin was like, I think you're screwing around too much, having fun.
[02:56:09.203 --> 02:56:10.244]  They don't normally give me advice.
[02:56:10.985 --> 02:56:12.566]  We cope with gallows humor.
[02:56:12.666 --> 02:56:14.267]  It's how we don't go crazy.
[02:56:15.134 --> 02:56:21.320]  I mean, it's better than turning stuff over, but we're going to have serious coverage of Bilderberg 2015 throughout this week.
[02:56:21.781 --> 02:56:22.742]  It's truly disgusting.
[02:56:22.762 --> 02:56:27.507]  I'm going to do some overdrive and hit some other issues with this McKinney situation with the police and the pool party.
[02:56:28.147 --> 02:56:30.230]  Folks are out burning American flags now up there.
[02:56:30.290 --> 02:56:35.675]  It's just really sad what's happened, this chain reaction that the White House has basically set off.
[02:56:36.736 --> 02:56:47.228]  Using some real issues out there to fan the flames, but I want to get a closing comment from Paul Watson and then from Rob Dew and Josh Owens there in Austria, site of Bilderberg 2016-2015, about to kick off.
[02:56:47.248 --> 02:56:47.649]  Paul Watson.
[02:56:51.578 --> 02:56:57.881]  Yeah, apparently they escorted Charlie Skelton of The Guardian back to his hotel in two police vans.
[02:56:57.941 --> 02:56:59.501]  They gave him a personal escort.
[02:56:59.521 --> 02:57:01.222]  He couldn't even get past the checkpoint.
[02:57:01.282 --> 02:57:09.846]  So, you know, if they want to draw more attention to themselves, then keep doing it, because it'll just make more headlines and shine further spotlight on Bilderberg.
[02:57:10.186 --> 02:57:17.269]  But we've got some of the agenda going up in a video in the next half an hour or so, and then we'll get the rest of the text up after that.
[02:57:17.309 --> 02:57:19.450]  So that's going up on InfoWars.com soon.
[02:57:19.870 --> 02:57:21.632]  This is from our high-level sources, folks.
[02:57:21.652 --> 02:57:26.117]  This is a big deal, and we should go to the hotel where Skelton is based.
[02:57:26.137 --> 02:57:31.823]  If you have that info, please give that to Rob Dew, so he can go interview Skelton about his situation.
[02:57:31.843 --> 02:57:35.707]  That's a major London Guardian reporter, and this is how they respond.
[02:57:35.968 --> 02:57:38.511]  Did he try to walk up there, or did they take his car?
[02:57:39.884 --> 02:57:57.452]  No, from what I understand, he drove up there in his own car and then they just turned him back, then gave him a personal escort with two police vans full of cops behind him all the way back to his own hotel, so... That's the London Guardian, undoubtedly the biggest English language paper in Europe, not just the UK.
[02:57:57.492 --> 02:58:01.294]  I mean, that's the paper they read, that they print on newsstands all over Europe.
[02:58:02.034 --> 02:58:06.457]  We're talking 400 million people have access to it, and that's how they act.
[02:58:06.497 --> 02:58:07.878]  I mean, that's like the New York Times.
[02:58:08.179 --> 02:58:15.704]  Yeah, he posted a picture right before that happened, too, on his Twitter, showing the checkpoint as he approached and then saying, hey, I'm being escorted out now by police.
[02:58:15.885 --> 02:58:17.286]  Let's show his Twitter if we can.
[02:58:17.746 --> 02:58:20.508]  This is simply... I keep using the word amazing, Paul.
[02:58:20.548 --> 02:58:21.429]  What do you make of this?
[02:58:23.018 --> 02:58:25.141]  It's stupid, that's what it is.
[02:58:25.201 --> 02:58:28.706]  Because they're just giving us more content, more videos and more headlines.
[02:58:28.726 --> 02:58:33.693]  If they don't want to draw attention to themselves, then be reasonable and don't harass journalists.
[02:58:33.773 --> 02:58:34.694]  It's pretty simple.
[02:58:35.195 --> 02:58:37.058]  Well, I mean, look at how the UK police acted.
[02:58:38.039 --> 02:58:38.279]  Yeah.
[02:58:39.525 --> 02:58:42.751]  No, there were no stories about police brutality out of that or harassment.
[02:58:42.771 --> 02:58:44.273]  There were none out of Copenhagen.
[02:58:44.293 --> 02:58:50.003]  Well, they didn't even arrest me when I did bust the blockade and got on the barge, because they knew that it was a First Amendment.
[02:58:50.403 --> 02:58:52.747]  Free speech over there, but the cops were telling me privately they agreed with me.
[02:58:53.584 --> 02:58:54.485]  Great job, Watson.
[02:58:54.525 --> 02:58:55.425]  Great job, everybody.
[02:58:55.465 --> 02:58:57.346]  Everybody stay there.
[02:58:57.406 --> 02:58:59.487]  I'm going to come back to Paul and the guys in Biggs.

[02:59:52.380 --> 02:59:54.661]  Visit Infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:59:54.681 --> 02:59:55.381]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:55.401 --> 02:59:57.001]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.890 --> 03:00:18.913]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:19.534 --> 03:00:22.555]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:22.916 --> 03:00:37.424]  Some of the breaking news up on Infowars.com is having added to it right now screenshots of these magazine articles and news articles going back even into the 70s about Cobra that's guarding, we're not joking, that's guarding
[03:00:39.096 --> 03:00:42.599]  The Bilderberg group from the press and acting like the press is evil.
[03:00:43.139 --> 03:00:55.027]  And the reason I started getting goofy last hour is you got a group called Cobra that's in a castle where they admittedly mind control and torture people and it's in major Florida newspapers and then that's who's running security.
[03:00:56.188 --> 03:00:58.950]  It's just upside down world as I said at the start of the broadcast.
[03:00:59.030 --> 03:00:59.651]  It's bizarre.
[03:00:59.951 --> 03:01:01.392]  Final comment on that Paul Watson.
[03:01:03.151 --> 03:01:08.513]  Yeah, again, it's stupid because they're going to draw more attention to themselves than otherwise would have happened.
[03:01:08.593 --> 03:01:12.555]  So we're going to get more headlines and more news stories out of it.
[03:01:12.855 --> 03:01:14.216]  One more thing on the agenda.
[03:01:14.616 --> 03:01:25.541]  They're talking about arming the Ukrainian militias, these openly neo-Nazi militants who, you know, string people up on crosses, burn them alive, hang people from the neck.
[03:01:26.101 --> 03:01:33.151]  So they're openly talking about arming them and possibly stoking a major confrontation between Russia and NATO before the end of the year.
[03:01:33.211 --> 03:01:34.492]  This is Bilderberg Agenda!
[03:01:34.532 --> 03:01:35.414]  This is Bilderberg Agenda!
[03:01:36.547 --> 03:01:40.030]  Yeah, same thing with the South China Sea situation there.
[03:01:40.470 --> 03:01:44.153]  They're going to not basically give China any room for maneuver on that.
[03:01:44.213 --> 03:01:45.974]  So again, possible confrontation.
[03:01:46.034 --> 03:01:50.258]  People have talked about China-US relations being the worst in 20, 30 years.
[03:01:50.498 --> 03:01:51.378]  Here's the problem.
[03:01:51.418 --> 03:01:56.102]  You can't maneuver the Chinese into a war like we did the Japanese because there's nuclear weapons now.
[03:01:57.523 --> 03:02:00.265]  And I'm not saying the Imperial Japanese didn't deserve some of it.
[03:02:00.285 --> 03:02:01.066]  They were pretty bad.
[03:02:01.666 --> 03:02:03.428]  But the Chinese have got nuclear weapons.
[03:02:04.926 --> 03:02:07.968]  Well, there's no Chinese representation at Bilderberg.
[03:02:08.148 --> 03:02:12.231]  There has been a smattering of it in recent years, but they've been completely frozen out now.
[03:02:12.692 --> 03:02:23.440]  So they're definitely, you know, trying to dismantle the BRICS ability to have any influence or challenge... Just like Putin was kicked out of G7 from G8, and now the Chinese call that totalitarian.
[03:02:24.482 --> 03:02:26.263]  Yeah, they said it was authoritarian rule.
[03:02:26.623 --> 03:02:31.225]  You've also got Jim Messina of the Messina Group who ran Obama's 2012 re-election campaign.
[03:02:31.485 --> 03:02:41.610]  He's now advising Hillary, so his job will be to basically strangle any funding, any financing for the other potential presidential candidates that will run against Hillary.
[03:02:41.670 --> 03:02:44.551]  So that will be his role at Bilderberg 2015.
[03:02:45.412 --> 03:02:47.613]  Paul, you are such an on-target great reporter.
[03:02:47.633 --> 03:02:49.073]  How long have we been working together?
[03:02:49.093 --> 03:02:49.433]  What, 13, 14 years?
[03:02:51.792 --> 03:02:52.612]  Something like that, yeah.
[03:02:52.652 --> 03:02:53.193]  Or longer?
[03:02:54.093 --> 03:02:55.633]  Since 2002, I think.
[03:02:55.793 --> 03:02:59.235]  Aren't you glad I forced you to do video blogs, forced you to get on air with us?
[03:03:00.355 --> 03:03:00.695]  Remember?
[03:03:01.275 --> 03:03:01.776]  Definitely.
[03:03:01.836 --> 03:03:05.017]  It's all picking up now and, you know, I'm looking forward to getting out there.
[03:03:05.697 --> 03:03:07.037]  And now look at ya!
[03:03:08.998 --> 03:03:11.619]  Why, I'm there with a gun, you're there with a belt, feeding me!
[03:03:13.960 --> 03:03:15.600]  It's worked out pretty well so far.
[03:03:16.421 --> 03:03:18.121]  Of course, folks, I said I'd quit joking around.
[03:03:18.141 --> 03:03:19.582]  That's a Dr. Strangelove joke.
[03:03:21.317 --> 03:03:22.438]  Isn't it, Paul?
[03:03:23.359 --> 03:03:25.521]  That you've been doing for about a decade.
[03:03:26.802 --> 03:03:31.707]  When I call up and want you to do a story, even if it's like midnight your time, it's an emergency, write the story, Paul.
[03:03:32.047 --> 03:03:32.568]  Come on!
[03:03:33.088 --> 03:03:34.350]  Come on, the Redcoats are coming!
[03:03:34.370 --> 03:03:36.812]  Get over there and feed me that belt, boy!
[03:03:38.554 --> 03:03:40.736]  Do you like working for General Jack T. Ripper?
[03:03:40.756 --> 03:03:41.657]  Just let's be honest.
[03:03:42.864 --> 03:03:43.645]  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
[03:04:02.394 --> 03:04:04.835]  It's all about rebranding authoritarianism.
[03:04:04.855 --> 03:04:07.357]  They know that these riots are coming, this civil unrest.
[03:04:07.397 --> 03:04:19.985]  You had the billionaire owner of Cartier the other day saying that he's afraid that these artificial intelligent robots will replace people, will basically make them lose their jobs, that that's going to cause a mass uprising.
[03:04:20.426 --> 03:04:26.330]  So basically Bilderberg wants more class warfare and civil unrest, like George Soros said was coming back in 2012.
[03:04:26.510 --> 03:04:31.373]  Now he's funding Black Lives Matter and all these movements that are creating that.
[03:04:31.493 --> 03:04:37.581]  But smart millionaires, almost to a man or woman who made their money, are freaked out trying to stabilize things.
[03:04:37.942 --> 03:04:39.484]  So there are some good forces out there.
[03:04:41.038 --> 03:04:46.860]  Yeah, and you know, sometimes they invite kind of mavericks from the outside, but then you've got all these Google people there.
[03:04:47.360 --> 03:04:52.841]  Elon Musk says that Google's basically creating an army of robots that's going to wipe out humanity.
[03:04:53.201 --> 03:04:59.703]  And now they invited another one from Google this year, so it seems pretty clear that Bilderberg is fully behind that artificial intelligence.
[03:04:59.723 --> 03:05:03.144]  Well, you're going to be publishing the full agenda, right?
[03:05:03.164 --> 03:05:03.844]  Today or tomorrow?
[03:05:05.385 --> 03:05:08.406]  Video's going up today, and then the full text tomorrow.
[03:05:08.426 --> 03:05:09.566]  All right, well done, Lord Watson.
[03:05:10.484 --> 03:05:10.724]  Okay.

[03:06:09.211 --> 03:06:09.991]  Effective.
[03:06:10.512 --> 03:06:26.787]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[03:06:26.807 --> 03:06:30.511]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[03:06:30.811 --> 03:06:34.433]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[03:06:34.813 --> 03:06:36.073]  HDfirearms.com.
[03:06:36.354 --> 03:06:39.555]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[03:06:39.675 --> 03:06:44.557]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.

[03:07:09.949 --> 03:07:13.451]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[03:07:14.192 --> 03:07:14.692]  It's true.
[03:07:14.812 --> 03:07:18.754]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[03:07:18.954 --> 03:07:20.815]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[03:07:21.356 --> 03:07:25.838]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[03:07:26.118 --> 03:07:38.743]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.

[03:07:50.572 --> 03:07:54.076]  The one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[03:07:54.296 --> 03:07:55.897]  Get your Big Berkey today.

[03:07:59.160 --> 03:08:00.522]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[03:08:00.582 --> 03:08:01.883]  For the love of clean water.
[03:08:18.939 --> 03:08:19.600]  Bilderberg, 2015.
[03:08:20.341 --> 03:08:26.091]  You'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
[03:08:26.993 --> 03:08:29.016]  We must be cautious in Austria.
[03:08:35.510 --> 03:08:45.858]  Robb New last week had the idea to have me voice that piece, and McBream put it together, where Obi-Wan Kenobi's looking at a lost Isley spaceport, and he says, you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
[03:08:45.878 --> 03:08:49.640]  It actually worked out pretty good, and it's turning out worse than we thought.
[03:08:49.701 --> 03:08:57.867]  Can you imagine how bad the police state's gonna be when this thing actually kicks off Thursday, and the private jets, oh yeah, go to the nearby airport, that's where they'll be landing.
[03:08:58.789 --> 03:09:05.431]  And then see how the cops act there whenever you're trying to follow the sedans or videotape it, which is what the press would do.
[03:09:05.471 --> 03:09:09.933]  I mean, when you've got the Kardashians having a marriage, there's 18 helicopters over it.
[03:09:10.453 --> 03:09:12.234]  This is 150 world leaders.
[03:09:12.574 --> 03:09:13.534]  We're not idiots.
[03:09:13.914 --> 03:09:17.576]  We try to cover stuff that really is important, not all the distractions.
[03:09:17.596 --> 03:09:20.057]  We're going to get Joe Big's take on all this in a moment.
[03:09:20.557 --> 03:09:26.759]  But finishing up, Rob Dew and Josh Owens from there in Austria, in the Alps, close to Bilderberg,
[03:09:27.079 --> 03:09:29.360]  They've already gone through two checkpoints to get to where they are.
[03:09:30.040 --> 03:09:31.141]  Other observations?
[03:09:31.561 --> 03:09:33.322]  I'd like to talk to Josh in a moment as well.
[03:09:33.522 --> 03:09:35.183]  And what are you going to do next, Rob Duke?
[03:09:36.823 --> 03:09:37.083]  Sure.
[03:09:37.223 --> 03:09:39.524]  Well, we have a couple of reports we need to put together.
[03:09:40.025 --> 03:09:43.006]  We want to get those out before they don't become timely.
[03:09:43.426 --> 03:09:47.528]  But what's interesting, I'm sitting out here out the back porch looking into the valley.
[03:09:47.768 --> 03:09:51.990]  There's two horses in front of me eating grass, just like oblivious
[03:09:52.375 --> 03:09:52.695]  I think so.
[03:10:07.495 --> 03:10:10.917]  So I'm not sure where he's at now, but he was supposed to be up here.
[03:10:10.937 --> 03:10:20.023]  I was looking forward to finally meeting him in person because I remember talking to him when he finally, um, when he turned, when he was making a big joke about the whole Bilderberg group.
[03:10:20.063 --> 03:10:20.704]  Ha ha ha.
[03:10:21.044 --> 03:10:22.044]  I'm a comedian guy.
[03:10:22.124 --> 03:10:27.268]  And then he got arrested twice at, uh, I believe it was Greece where he was at.
[03:10:27.988 --> 03:10:29.069]  And, you know, it's just,
[03:10:29.525 --> 03:10:34.768]  People don't realize how real it is because they read all this stuff in the newspapers that are like, oh, it's a fake group.
[03:10:34.808 --> 03:10:35.469]  It doesn't exist.
[03:10:35.889 --> 03:10:38.350]  Well, if it's so fake, why are there checkpoints everywhere?
[03:10:38.651 --> 03:10:46.095]  Why do I have a van of cops at the hotel that I'm at and then another van of cops at the entrance to the hotel to the road?
[03:10:46.395 --> 03:10:49.297]  And then there's two checkpoints going down to the village.
[03:10:50.458 --> 03:10:51.518]  Why so much security?
[03:10:51.538 --> 03:10:53.459]  Because this George Carlin said...
[03:10:55.216 --> 03:10:58.297]  Because George Carlin said the owners are in control.
[03:10:58.317 --> 03:10:59.097]  You ain't in it.
[03:10:59.657 --> 03:11:00.878]  It's a big club and you ain't in it.
[03:11:00.898 --> 03:11:01.518]  It's a big group.
[03:11:02.258 --> 03:11:02.598]  Yeah.
[03:11:02.898 --> 03:11:04.759]  That's a club they beat you over the head with.
[03:11:08.039 --> 03:11:09.280]  George Carlin had it right.
[03:11:10.060 --> 03:11:13.761]  I want to get Josh Owens' take on this situation in closing.
[03:11:13.781 --> 03:11:14.501]  Good job guys.
[03:11:14.521 --> 03:11:15.041]  Great job.
[03:11:15.701 --> 03:11:17.422]  Let's talk to Josh Owens here real quick.
[03:11:17.482 --> 03:11:19.142]  A fellow reporter with Rob Duby just joined us.
[03:11:19.162 --> 03:11:20.143]  I have to hand him the phone.
[03:11:20.183 --> 03:11:20.763]  Hold on one second.
[03:11:28.174 --> 03:11:32.477]  Okay, Josh, give us your take on what you've seen unfold so far.
[03:11:34.979 --> 03:11:40.123]  Well, I think these are just a bunch of nice guys that are just trying to help us out, you know.
[03:11:40.863 --> 03:11:42.144]  They seem like good people.
[03:11:42.164 --> 03:11:44.246]  I don't think he was really trying to turn my phone off.
[03:11:44.306 --> 03:11:45.907]  I think he was just trying to help me save my battery.
[03:11:46.528 --> 03:11:49.710]  Okay, so I know we were screwing around earlier, but we're not now.
[03:11:50.050 --> 03:11:51.491]  Are you telling me they grabbed at your telephone?
[03:11:51.511 --> 03:11:52.092]  Tell us what happened.
[03:11:53.351 --> 03:12:05.115]  Yeah, well, when we walked into the police station, the one guy who came up, there was a female sitting down, you guys saw it live, and there was another guy that walked up, and he said, what are you doing?
[03:12:05.135 --> 03:12:10.036]  And I said, filming, and he lunged for my camera, and then I pulled it back, and he just walked off.
[03:12:11.196 --> 03:12:13.157]  I think he knew that he knew there was nothing he could do.
[03:12:13.217 --> 03:12:16.558]  Well, there's your headline, Austrian police try to take reporter's camera.
[03:12:17.978 --> 03:12:20.179]  Yeah, it was an intimidation tactic.
[03:12:23.424 --> 03:12:25.025]  Well we've looked and there's no law.
[03:12:25.345 --> 03:12:29.988]  Charlie Skelton was escorted back by two vehicles even though he was supposedly staying at the same lodge as you.
[03:12:30.008 --> 03:12:33.110]  So I guess they've gotten to the point now of not letting people through.
[03:12:33.150 --> 03:12:34.611]  I guess you're lucky you even made it through.
[03:12:34.631 --> 03:12:36.492]  Austrian police lunge at First Amendment.
[03:12:37.373 --> 03:12:37.553]  Yeah.
[03:12:39.164 --> 03:12:50.087]  Well, when we got stopped at the checkpoint, they made me open every zipper of every bag, and they even tore up the upholstery in the back, where there's usually a tire under there.
[03:12:50.367 --> 03:12:53.688]  They opened it up, there's no tire there, and they ripped up the upholstery.
[03:12:53.988 --> 03:12:57.549]  They pulled up the upholstery to see, I'm not sure what they thought we were smuggling in.
[03:12:58.769 --> 03:12:59.990]  But yeah, it's outrageous.
[03:13:00.030 --> 03:13:01.310]  It's unbelievable.
[03:13:02.930 --> 03:13:08.355]  Well, it's a major governmental secret policy meeting that's totally illegal in the U.S.
[03:13:08.395 --> 03:13:09.115]  and other laws.
[03:13:09.616 --> 03:13:11.357]  Violates the Logan Act and so many others.
[03:13:11.417 --> 03:13:12.058]  It's racketeering.
[03:13:12.638 --> 03:13:15.441]  I mean, they talk about the Soccer Association meeting and secret stuff.
[03:13:15.841 --> 03:13:16.722]  This is the real deal.
[03:13:17.202 --> 03:13:25.109]  And the people that go, from LIBOR, with all the rigging of the banks, rigging of the interest rates, rigging of the currency rates, this is a criminal mafia.
[03:13:25.129 --> 03:13:27.290]  This is the Mega Mafia 2.0.
[03:13:28.111 --> 03:13:30.053]  Alright, well Josh, anything else you'd like to add?
[03:13:31.690 --> 03:13:38.612]  I just, I believe, you know, this is just the second day we've been here, and I hate to say it, but it seems like this stuff is just going to keep getting worse.
[03:13:38.873 --> 03:13:40.793]  You know, they freaked out at first when we weren't filming.
[03:13:40.813 --> 03:13:42.574]  They went crazy when we were filming.
[03:13:42.794 --> 03:13:44.414]  We got kicked out of the police station.
[03:13:44.875 --> 03:13:47.475]  This time, the first time, they just looked at our bag.
[03:13:47.536 --> 03:13:50.256]  This time, we had to open every single compartment in the bag.
[03:13:50.276 --> 03:13:51.597]  Then they ripped up the upholstery.
[03:13:52.097 --> 03:13:53.658]  There's no telling where it's going to go day 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[03:13:53.998 --> 03:13:56.459]  It's going to be, it's unbelievable.
[03:14:01.638 --> 03:14:02.740]  Bilderberg hasn't even started.
[03:14:03.100 --> 03:14:03.822]  Let me put it that way.
[03:14:04.002 --> 03:14:08.031]  Bilderberg hasn't even started and it's already descended into this ridiculousness.
[03:14:09.411 --> 03:14:11.112]  Thank you so much, Josh Owens.
[03:14:11.132 --> 03:14:11.613]  Be safe.
[03:14:11.653 --> 03:14:12.453]  We'll pray for you.
[03:14:12.834 --> 03:14:18.798]  DrudgeReport.com is breaking the electronic Berlin Wall, but Drudge has to link to foreign press.
[03:14:19.679 --> 03:14:26.584]  Drudge has to link to foreign press, like the London Guardian, The Independent, and others, to get English-speaking news.
[03:14:27.005 --> 03:14:29.046]  Forget G7 Summit.
[03:14:29.066 --> 03:14:30.648]  Bilderberg is where the big guns go.
[03:14:31.188 --> 03:14:31.809]  Businesses
[03:14:32.649 --> 03:14:37.354]  Bosses lobby politicians on future of EU and then InfoWars.com!
[03:14:37.874 --> 03:14:38.975]  Abolition of cash!
[03:14:39.055 --> 03:14:40.257]  Capital controls!
[03:14:40.837 --> 03:14:44.401]  And our story, breaking that down by Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:14:44.781 --> 03:14:53.389]  Paul writes, the powerful Bilderberg Group will discuss imposing more capital controls on average citizens, while HSBC, whose group chairman,
[03:14:54.150 --> 03:15:02.497]  Will attend the conference, is set to pay more than 40 million dollars for illegal money laundering involving arms dealers and helping the wealthy avoid taxes.
[03:15:02.837 --> 03:15:03.978]  Well, what does Hillary do?
[03:15:04.338 --> 03:15:08.621]  She gets money at her foundation when she heads up the State Department to let dictators get weapons.
[03:15:09.282 --> 03:15:11.263]  I mean, these are the real criminals, folks.
[03:15:12.024 --> 03:15:15.006]  It's very much a case of do as I say, not as I do.
[03:15:15.367 --> 03:15:16.668]  And they want to get rid of cash.
[03:15:17.348 --> 03:15:21.932]  They admit in press releases show they can tax our money in bail-ins
[03:15:23.775 --> 03:15:27.240]  Like they're doing in Europe, taking our money so we can't take it and put it in a mattress.
[03:15:27.280 --> 03:15:29.763]  They want us fully under their digital control.
[03:15:30.164 --> 03:15:32.867]  Very important article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:15:33.088 --> 03:15:35.731]  And I salute Matt Drudge for being the only big media.
[03:15:36.252 --> 03:15:38.335]  He is alternative media, but big media.
[03:15:39.500 --> 03:15:40.721]  To cover Bilderberg.
[03:15:41.402 --> 03:15:42.823]  Others are ridiculing us.
[03:15:42.983 --> 03:15:44.544]  I've got the clips.
[03:15:44.744 --> 03:15:45.665]  I'm not going to give them attention.
[03:15:46.105 --> 03:15:48.427]  Mainline conservatives are saying we're full of prunes.
[03:15:48.968 --> 03:15:50.729]  All right, Joe Biggs, you've got five minutes.
[03:15:50.749 --> 03:15:52.431]  You've got the floor until we end the transmission.
[03:15:52.731 --> 03:15:53.892]  Your overall view on this.
[03:15:53.912 --> 03:15:56.074]  Your overall view on Cobra and where you see this going.
[03:15:56.766 --> 03:15:58.907]  Yeah, I definitely see this ramping up more and more.
[03:15:58.947 --> 03:16:01.927]  Like Josh said, the security press is definitely going to stand up.
[03:16:01.967 --> 03:16:07.269]  And once these elites start coming in to play and these guys are convoying in, you can see a whole grid locked down.
[03:16:07.789 --> 03:16:14.791]  And like I said, my concern is that these guys are really being extra careful because these guys, like I said, they kind of, you know,
[03:16:16.867 --> 03:16:17.287]  I don't know.
[03:16:34.266 --> 03:16:38.950]  And just overall security of what's going on, because I wouldn't put it past these guys to do something like that.
[03:16:39.270 --> 03:16:42.573]  Because like you said, every day it's ramping up more and more.
[03:16:42.613 --> 03:16:43.854]  These guys are walking through the woods.
[03:16:43.874 --> 03:16:48.959]  You've got the guy who owns this room where they're staying, saying that there's a good chance they could come back at nighttime.
[03:16:48.999 --> 03:16:54.964]  So I'm hoping that, you know, they can keep a good eye out, also get some rest, but maintain some discipline.
[03:16:57.114 --> 03:17:03.942]  I almost sent you, but you've been so busy and you wanted to go, but I haven't sent Rob and Josh on something in a while.
[03:17:03.962 --> 03:17:14.493]  I know there's some things breaking down up in McKinney by Dallas and you might be going up to that, but what would you be doing right now if you were in Austria?
[03:17:15.452 --> 03:17:19.055]  Well, definitely pulling back, looking at those maps, trying to see if I can find some alternate routes.
[03:17:19.655 --> 03:17:23.339]  Uh, maybe circle around into some other cities and then try to come in.
[03:17:23.379 --> 03:17:24.600]  There was another back way.
[03:17:25.020 --> 03:17:27.282]  Maybe they don't have as much security there.
[03:17:27.302 --> 03:17:29.484]  I don't know, but definitely look at those alternate routes.
[03:17:29.544 --> 03:17:31.045]  And all you want to do is videotape the building.
[03:17:31.145 --> 03:17:32.026]  I mean, be a journalist.
[03:17:32.086 --> 03:17:32.266]  Yeah.
[03:17:33.787 --> 03:17:36.750]  I mean, I'm going to go out and hike and get through the woods and find out what's going on.
[03:17:36.790 --> 03:17:36.950]  I mean,
[03:17:38.958 --> 03:17:47.720]  I'd be kind of curious to see how they react if they approach you in the woods, if they were to take a hike and go up into one of those trails and see what would happen with that as well, you know?
[03:17:48.020 --> 03:17:50.761]  What do you think the strategy is putting checkpoints six miles away?
[03:17:52.381 --> 03:18:02.904]  It's to, for something like that, when you do roving checkpoints and you move them around, you do that whenever you think or you've been told by your higher-up that there's a chance that there could be some kind of like outside attack.
[03:18:03.703 --> 03:18:07.085]  Like I said, that's what concerns me about how they're saying they're like the FBI.
[03:18:07.105 --> 03:18:15.269]  We know that the FBI staged things before, and this would be a way to lock everything down and then not allow anything in there whatsoever.
[03:18:15.289 --> 03:18:19.652]  And then they could do their secret meeting and then go on about their way and detain journalists.
[03:18:23.416 --> 03:18:27.140]  Shifting gears, the Soros destabilization program is in full swing.
[03:18:27.180 --> 03:18:42.715]  What do you think of that video of the cops mainly grabbing black kids at a swimming pool in McKinney, up by Dallas, and then now, I mean I think the cop is a little out of control, but then now the response of burning American flags and stuff, how is that now the default response?
[03:18:43.416 --> 03:18:48.500]  Because you get these same George Soros funded people coming in, these pawns that are working for him.
[03:18:48.761 --> 03:19:00.211]  They show up to, there's this one guy, his name's DeRay something, he shows up at every protest, he's got like 140,000 Twitter followers, and he's like the main voice, he's like the celebrity Black Lives Matter guy.
[03:19:02.020 --> 03:19:08.223]  He tweeted out last night and said, oh my God, it was so nice to come to Texas and see so many familiar faces.
[03:19:08.623 --> 03:19:11.344]  People from Ferguson, Baltimore, Cleveland, D.C.
[03:19:11.745 --> 03:19:14.066]  It's the same people that go around to all these things.
[03:19:14.406 --> 03:19:17.167]  They take an incident and then they blow it up.
[03:19:18.688 --> 03:19:20.109]  And then they're out there just trying to get a paycheck.
[03:19:20.509 --> 03:19:21.509]  You know, what's happened to McKinney?
[03:19:21.529 --> 03:19:24.731]  Yeah, the officer to pull a gun on a bunch of teenagers.
[03:19:25.671 --> 03:19:27.672]  They're obviously in bathing suits at a pool party.
[03:19:28.072 --> 03:19:28.913]  That's pretty extreme.
[03:19:29.073 --> 03:19:30.614]  And they're just standing like 10 feet away.
[03:19:30.914 --> 03:19:31.074]  Yeah.
[03:19:32.662 --> 03:19:36.686]  But again, they're just training the cops to act like they're commandos in World War I or something.
[03:19:37.047 --> 03:19:39.589]  And they're just so ready to go, it's just explosive.
[03:19:39.609 --> 03:19:48.979]  Well, I mean, you know, when I was a kid, I've had run-ins with police, and they would always approach you, ask you what was going on, and then, you know, as a last resort, ever reach for a gun.
[03:19:49.019 --> 03:19:52.963]  Now it's a reach for the gun first, and then try to figure everything out later on in court.
[03:19:53.143 --> 03:19:54.384]  And it escalates everything.
[03:19:54.664 --> 03:19:55.384]  It's just crazy.
[03:19:55.744 --> 03:19:59.927]  And then the globalists that have engineered this mindset are gonna play on that to make it even worse.
[03:20:00.207 --> 03:20:01.968]  That's it for extended coverage of Bilderberg.
[03:20:02.028 --> 03:20:02.888]  Tonight, more.
[03:20:03.189 --> 03:20:05.250]  And the latest breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[03:20:05.270 --> 03:20:07.991]  But tonight, 7 o'clock central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:20:08.031 --> 03:20:09.052]  Help us spread the word.
