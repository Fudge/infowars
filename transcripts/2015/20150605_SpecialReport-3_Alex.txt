[00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:14.040]  We are here to announce the unsealing of charges and the arrests of individuals as part of our long-running investigation into bribery and corruption in the world of organized soccer.
[00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.162]  It must have been let's pretend we work for the American People Day over at the Department of Justice.
[00:00:19.622 --> 00:00:35.358]  Newly appointed United States Attorney General Loretta Lynch dropped the hammer on World Cup soccer executives, issuing warrants for their arrest regarding the accumulation of over $150 million received by employing methods of racketeering, money laundering, and wire fraud.
[00:00:35.658 --> 00:00:41.520]  The head of the snake of this notorious soccer empire, Sepp Blatter, will of course remain untouched.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:55.944]  Bread and Circus historically serves as a huge distraction while the real criminals mingle in smoke-filled rooms holding the puppet strings of law enforcement that knows full well how they arrived at their position and where the real line is drawn.
[00:00:56.204 --> 00:01:08.998]  And so it goes, while the world watches soccer executives scurrying out like rats, no arrests, no warrants, nothing is done to the instigators of a far greater recent scandal that dealt punishing blows to the economy.
[00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:14.545]  Six banks have agreed to pay a combined $5.8 billion to the Justice Department and other regulators.
[00:01:14.905 --> 00:01:17.428]  Five of them have pled guilty to criminal charges.
[00:01:17.828 --> 00:01:28.432]  Citicorp, JP Morgan, Barclays and RPS are pleading guilty to charges tied to forex manipulation while UBS is pleading guilty to interest rate manipulation charges.
[00:01:28.652 --> 00:01:32.313]  They have each agreed to a three-year corporate probation period.
[00:01:32.653 --> 00:01:39.536]  No scurrying executives, no impending jail time, just a laughable corporate probation period and fines.
[00:01:39.876 --> 00:01:45.838]  Who cares if executives of the most powerful banks colluded on rigging interest rates to make billions of dollars?
[00:01:46.278 --> 00:02:01.644]  The DOJ doesn't seem to mind that the Department of Defense spent $4 million on taxpayer-funded credit cards for personal charges, including $3.2 million of it at casinos and $100,000 at strip clubs by 646 government cardholders.
[00:02:02.104 --> 00:02:09.987]  While the average American family is seeing their health care costs skyrocket, the government throws away billions per year on waste and fraud.
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:20.877]  Those very same officials spending our taxpayer dollars will be right on board once the cash trough is replaced by digital currency, and that is coming sooner than most people think.
[00:02:21.097 --> 00:02:29.720]  A new age of economic totalitarianism, as highlighted by economist Martin Armstrong, is being discussed with zeal in secret meetings in London.
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.087]  Armstrong writes, this idea of eliminating cash first floated as the normal trial balloon to see how the people would take it.
[00:02:37.287 --> 00:02:43.934]  Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University and William Buter, the chief economist at Citigroup, first launched the concept.
[00:02:44.174 --> 00:02:50.921]  Their claims have been widely hailed and their papers are now the foundation for the new age of economic totalitarianism that confronts us.
[00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:58.547]  Rogoff and Buter have laid the groundwork for the end of much of our freedom, and one day will be considered the new Marx with hindsight.
[00:02:58.847 --> 00:03:06.893]  Considerations of their arguments have shown how governments can seize all economic power and destroy cash in the process of eliminating all rights.
[00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:15.059]  Physical paper money provides the check against negative interest rates, for if they become too great, people will simply withdraw their funds and hoard cash.
[00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:17.821]  Furthermore, paper currency allows for bank runs.
[00:03:18.061 --> 00:03:24.865]  Eliminate paper currency and what you end up with is the elimination of the ability to demand to withdraw funds from a bank.
[00:03:25.145 --> 00:03:28.487]  Our defense department squanders billions of taxpayer dollars.
[00:03:28.588 --> 00:03:33.611]  We wanted to know how much taxpayer money the government spends on these mysterious micro-purchases.
[00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:35.152]  So we found out.
[00:03:35.592 --> 00:03:38.114]  Our review found about 20 billion dollars.
[00:03:38.894 --> 00:03:40.275]  In just about the course of a year.
[00:03:40.675 --> 00:03:48.581]  We asked all of these other major federal agencies based here in DC for their micro-purchase shopping lists and all refused.
[00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:56.426]  The same cadre of criminals that crashed the economy in 2008 were merely slapped on the old wrist after being caught rigging interest rates.
[00:03:56.727 --> 00:04:02.991]  And world governments are colluding to imprison the population with a digital currency that will enslave anyone
[00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:13.441]  That doesn't adhere to the impending New World Order system run by a group of elite scum that would become far more powerful than anything we have ever imagined in our worst nightmares.
[00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:20.848]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP as it is called, is an all out assault on our national sovereignty.
[00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.672]  It would unconstitutionally transfer legislative powers from the U.S.
[00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:37.163]  Congress, our state legislatures, our city and county governments, to multinational corporations and unaccountable international bureaucrats at the World Trade Organization.
[00:04:37.723 --> 00:04:44.285]  Americans are still off in la-la land thinking that the United States has the sovereignty.
[00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:59.488]  You know, the International Organization of Securities Commission regulates on market, and there's a Basel Commission on Banking, and BIS, Bank International Settlements.
[00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:03.289]  The Federal Reserve is part of BIS.
[00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:13.232]  It regulates banking, you know, the International Criminal Court of Europe has jurisdiction over here in the United States.
[00:05:13.612 --> 00:05:21.114]  So the American people need to wake up that the sovereignty of the United States is gone.
[00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:23.594]  Global government's not coming, it's here.
[00:05:24.475 --> 00:05:25.215]  Exactly.
[00:05:25.683 --> 00:05:34.207]  But twisting a few media moguls arms to squeeze out bribes within an industry built on kicking a ball around a field is far more important.
[00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:36.508]  John Bowne, InfoWars.com
[00:05:43.683 --> 00:05:47.064]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself.
[00:05:47.485 --> 00:05:50.846]  Our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:05:50.946 --> 00:05:53.107]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:05:53.307 --> 00:05:58.489]  Indoor air has been shown to have 2 to 5 times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:03.751]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:06.993]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:06:07.273 --> 00:06:11.195]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:06:11.415 --> 00:06:15.718]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:06:15.798 --> 00:06:25.943]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:06:26.163 --> 00:06:28.705]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:06:29.025 --> 00:06:37.060]  Manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
