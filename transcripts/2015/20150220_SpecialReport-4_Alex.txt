[00:00:06.704 --> 00:00:09.014]  Look at that one!
[00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:09.576]  We're talking!
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.162]  So just what is Obama's proposed net neutrality plan?
[00:00:16.503 --> 00:00:17.603]  Well, that's the problem.
[00:00:17.944 --> 00:00:19.464]  Nobody quite knows for sure.
[00:00:19.825 --> 00:00:29.631]  The FCC has made it clear that they will not release the 332-page plan to regulate the Internet until after the agency votes on it.
[00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:33.213]  Other times we've heard this, we've got to pass it to find out what's in it.
[00:00:33.874 --> 00:00:36.115]  It hasn't really fared well for the American consumer.
[00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:39.858]  Now, one of the FCC commissioners, Ajit Pai, has gone rogue.
[00:00:40.618 --> 00:00:43.180]  He's been publishing a few articles in recent weeks.
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.383]  These are press releases that other FCC leadership has moved to block.
[00:00:47.883 --> 00:00:53.547]  And he's basically warning citizens and lawmakers that this net neutrality is a bad deal.
[00:00:53.767 --> 00:00:54.367]  Pai writes,
[00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.196]  The most problematic may be the new Internet Conduct Rule.
[00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:13.673]  It's a vague rule that gives the FCC almost unfettered discretion to micromanage virtually every aspect of the Internet, including the choices that consumers have for accessing it.
[00:01:14.113 --> 00:01:26.539]  This includes restricting service plan options, including unlimited online streaming, as well as low-price, prepaid voice plans, which are used by millions of low-income households.
[00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:31.021]  When consumers have more choices, they can find lower prices.
[00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:36.163]  But the FCC wants to do away with anything but one-size-fits-all plans.
[00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:44.346]  Think of it like how all of your health insurance plans now include prenatal care, even if you're a 75-year-old retiree.
[00:01:44.946 --> 00:01:48.828]  Allowing for new business models is critical to promote competition.
[00:01:49.128 --> 00:01:56.631]  How can we expect entrepreneurs to stand out from their competition if they aren't able to compete with a standardized plan?
[00:01:57.011 --> 00:02:01.853]  Clearly, the President's plan is only going to benefit the existing Internet giants.
[00:02:02.373 --> 00:02:05.074]  But the issue is, the Internet isn't broke.
[00:02:05.414 --> 00:02:07.455]  We don't need the president to fix it.
[00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:33.587]  Plus, current law already protects consumers and competition online, and the President's plan would strip away those existing protections.
[00:02:34.007 --> 00:02:43.132]  The Federal Trade Commission has the authority to quickly protect consumers and aggressively police market power and fraud in the Internet economy.
[00:02:43.692 --> 00:02:48.634]  Regulating the Internet like a public utility would strip the FTC of these powers.
[00:02:49.074 --> 00:02:54.157]  Why would we want to do that when the Internet has flourished under the current regulatory model?
[00:02:54.597 --> 00:02:56.378]  Doesn't make sense.
[00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.141]  79% of Americans want to see the plan before the vote on February 26th.
[00:03:01.042 --> 00:03:07.167]  Isn't it about time that Obama made good on his campaign promise to be the most transparent administration ever?
[00:03:07.707 --> 00:03:17.675]  How can we have an open debate about whether or not the President's plan to regulate the Internet is going to be good for the American consumer when it hasn't even been made public?
