[00:00:04.761 --> 00:00:12.663]  Baltimore's local rate of employment fell below the national average, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
[00:00:12.683 --> 00:00:17.644]  20.7% of Baltimore's employment is made up by city, state, and federal government workers.
[00:00:17.964 --> 00:00:19.244]  The national average is 15%.
[00:00:19.584 --> 00:00:27.946]  This bureaucratic stronghold, just 50 miles from Washington, D.C., has been run by Democrats for decades.
[00:00:28.286 --> 00:00:34.589]  Yet it ranks 7th as the most segregated city in the United States in a Brown University data project.
[00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:37.271]  The City Council is completely democratic.
[00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:46.115]  Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake had a top leadership position in the Democratic National Committee and provides key input into Obama's task force on policing.
[00:00:46.195 --> 00:00:46.475]  We're good.
[00:01:03.177 --> 00:01:08.139]  which is overseen by Baltimore representative Elijah Cummings has been an incumbent since 1996.
[00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:19.742]  Apparently the Democratic base in Baltimore is completely useless if the transformation of Baltimore into a shining example of Democratic hyper governance has never occurred.
[00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:28.725]  And why does the country need to search its soul or more importantly federalized state and local police departments immediately after the events in Baltimore?
[00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:55.550]  Since Ferguson and the task force that we put together, we have seen too many instances of what appears to be police officers interacting with individuals, primarily African American, often poor, in ways that raise troubling questions.
[00:01:56.051 --> 00:01:57.951]  And it comes up, it seems like,
[00:01:59.102 --> 00:01:59.643]  Once a week now.
[00:02:01.044 --> 00:02:06.469]  Once every couple of weeks, coming out of the task force that we put together, we're now working with local communities.
[00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:14.256]  The Department of Justice has just announced a grant program for those jurisdictions that want to purchase body cameras.
[00:02:15.397 --> 00:02:21.422]  We are going to be issuing grants for those jurisdictions that are prepared to start trying to implement
[00:02:21.758 --> 00:02:25.666]  Some of the new training and data collection and other things that can make a difference.
[00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.255]  And we're going to keep on working with those local jurisdictions.
[00:02:32.848 --> 00:02:37.490]  So that they can begin to make the changes that are necessary.
[00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:52.197]  President Obama has unleashed his Cloward Piven style rhetoric via his advisor and race relations bulldog, Al Sharpton, a former coke dealing FBI informant who rose to prominence on the back of the Tijuana Brawley race baiting theater of lies.
[00:02:52.477 --> 00:02:58.460]  A man who has mysteriously suffered two suspicious fires exonerating his financial records from persecution.
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:07.743]  And is currently under fire for taking major donations for his non-profit from labor unions that aired their hyperbole on his cable show.
[00:03:08.043 --> 00:03:12.684]  Al Sharpton, a man that was seen as a pariah to the Eric Garner and Walter Scott families.
[00:03:12.964 --> 00:03:19.546]  Does the family have any messages for anybody who might want to come into the community and incite violence or rallies or anything like that?
[00:03:19.807 --> 00:03:23.528]  Yes, the message is, what's the point?
[00:03:24.702 --> 00:03:29.646]  Seeing that happen in other places, that does nothing whatsoever to help the situation.
[00:03:29.986 --> 00:03:31.867]  It only makes it worse.
[00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:37.312]  He has had Al Sharpton to the White House 80, 85 times.
[00:03:38.452 --> 00:03:42.435]  Often when he's talking about police issues, he has Al Sharpton sitting next to him.
[00:03:43.016 --> 00:03:47.039]  You put Al Sharpton next to you, you just told everyone, I'm against the police.
[00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:50.023]  We're gonna do this march from here to Washington.
[00:03:50.523 --> 00:03:54.088]  We need the Justice Department to step in and take over policing in this country.
[00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.774]  In the 20th century, they had to fight states' rights to get the right to vote.
[00:03:58.814 --> 00:04:02.980]  We're gonna have to fight states' rights in terms of closing down police cases.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:12.682]  The only group to do that is the federal government itself openly run by five foreign mega banks that own the private Federal Reserve.
[00:04:13.062 --> 00:04:16.262]  But now Al Sharpton says it's going to be the police.
[00:04:16.943 --> 00:04:19.903]  And that means your local counties and your cities.
[00:04:20.463 --> 00:04:28.485]  That means your sheriffs that the feds have been for 50 years trying to fund initiative at the state level to have your police departments take over your sheriff's departments.
[00:04:28.825 --> 00:04:29.745]  That is backwards.
[00:04:31.127 --> 00:04:33.249]  The counties are chartered by the state.
[00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:35.070]  The sheriffs are elected.
[00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:49.082]  If a municipal government, the lowest level of government, wishes to vote for the citizens to raise taxes to create a police force, under municipal law, they are allowed to.
[00:04:49.582 --> 00:04:53.424]  Clearly advocating the rollout of the 1961 U.S.
[00:04:53.464 --> 00:05:10.335]  Department of State 7277 plan that would have the police forces disarmed, martial law on the streets, and the graduation of a United Nations international police force to protect the corporocratic government as it exponentially grows into a new world order.
[00:05:10.555 --> 00:05:17.439]  We are trying to act as though these are problems that you can handle in isolation.
[00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.982]  There must be a national response to a national issue.
[00:05:23.942 --> 00:05:26.684]  And we can't keep running like hamsters.
[00:05:27.104 --> 00:05:39.931]  I worry about you, brother, because you could be easily manipulated by those in the White House who do have the interest of Wall Street oligarchs, who do have the interest of corporate plutocrats, and you oppose, but you end up being the public face.
[00:05:40.171 --> 00:05:42.113]  John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[00:05:49.218 --> 00:05:56.384]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:05:56.484 --> 00:05:58.666]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:05:58.846 --> 00:06:04.050]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.294]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:06:09.434 --> 00:06:12.536]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:06:12.816 --> 00:06:16.739]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:21.262]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:06:21.342 --> 00:06:31.489]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:34.251]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:06:34.571 --> 00:06:42.738]  Manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
