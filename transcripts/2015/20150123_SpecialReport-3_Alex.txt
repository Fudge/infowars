[00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.713]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:22.684]  Now, an article was released today by the Daily Sheeple, and the headline is, is the ISIS Japanese beheading video green screened or what?
[00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:24.086]  People aren't buying it.
[00:00:24.486 --> 00:00:26.789]  Well, let's go ahead and take a look into this article.
[00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:33.254]  What they're saying so far is that they believe that this is a fake green screen video.
[00:00:33.715 --> 00:00:42.702]  And the main reason for that, if you look at the Japanese man who was on his knees to the left side, the shadow is on the inside of his neck.
[00:00:42.983 --> 00:00:48.187]  Then the other man to the left of him is on the exact same side.
[00:00:48.588 --> 00:00:51.310]  So that would show that there are two different suns in the sky
[00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:52.331]  We're good to go.
[00:01:11.534 --> 00:01:11.854]  Of course!
[00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:31.815]  Look pretty fake.
[00:01:31.835 --> 00:01:33.615]  We've been questioning it for some time.
[00:01:33.855 --> 00:01:37.357]  What we want to do is just point out the fact that this does look a bit sketchy.
[00:01:37.617 --> 00:01:41.239]  They've already said that they've picked up a lot of ISIS supporters who are in America.
[00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.242]  You know, so these kind of guys would probably have the tools to be able to edit a video like that.
[00:01:47.522 --> 00:01:50.703]  And it looks like this time on this video, they've kind of lost their touch.
[00:01:51.024 --> 00:01:57.887]  So we're going to take a look at a different video and show you how easy it would be to possibly set something up like this.
[00:01:58.507 --> 00:02:06.392]  For all you Westerners that will be watching this, this is American journalist Josh Owens of Infowars.com.
[00:02:06.712 --> 00:02:09.874]  All he does is spread lies about the ISIS caliphate.
[00:02:10.274 --> 00:02:13.276]  Stop, start over.
[00:02:13.676 --> 00:02:14.076]  What's wrong?
[00:02:14.637 --> 00:02:16.218]  I'm trying to look like I'm in a desert!
[00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:21.342]  How else would these stupid Americans believe what is going on if you can't get these f***ing lights right?
[00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:27.384]  I'm tired of reading the Daily Sheeple and Fox News and all this saying, oh, ISIS can't even make a real video!
[00:02:30.285 --> 00:02:31.205]  I'm trying to get into character.
[00:02:31.245 --> 00:02:32.105]  You look like a woman.
[00:02:34.106 --> 00:02:35.546]  The women cover their faces up.
[00:02:36.026 --> 00:02:38.167]  Okay, why don't you watch the video of the guy and tell me what you see.
[00:02:41.428 --> 00:02:41.988]  Hold this a second.
[00:02:50.031 --> 00:02:51.552]  I don't think you're sharp enough to cut my head off.
[00:02:51.752 --> 00:02:51.972]  No.
[00:02:53.414 --> 00:02:54.214]  That's the whole point.
[00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:56.556]  You stupid American.
[00:02:56.616 --> 00:02:57.737]  You think you know everything.
[00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:06.903]  This is a warning to Western countries who try to step up to the caliphate.
[00:03:07.444 --> 00:03:11.867]  We will ruin the world and we will kill any Ameri- What?
[00:03:13.188 --> 00:03:14.369]  Oh, Lord, damn it!
[00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:15.069]  Sorry.
[00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.390]  Wrong set!
[00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.232]  I'm trying to do a beheading video here!
[00:03:19.022 --> 00:03:20.022]  For the love of Allah!
[00:03:21.343 --> 00:03:21.783]  Okay.
[00:03:23.583 --> 00:03:29.945]  Back to the video.
[00:03:31.325 --> 00:03:32.386]  The shadows don't match.
[00:03:32.426 --> 00:03:33.446]  People are going to find out.
[00:03:33.466 --> 00:03:34.846]  They keep putting it in the articles.
[00:03:35.126 --> 00:03:36.787]  We have to read what they're saying.
[00:03:37.027 --> 00:03:37.707]  It makes sense.
[00:03:37.727 --> 00:03:40.388]  Let me try this.
[00:03:41.068 --> 00:03:41.488]  Does that work?
[00:03:41.508 --> 00:03:42.168]  Does that look better?
[00:03:42.768 --> 00:03:43.129]  Or that?
[00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.769]  One.
[00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:44.669]  Two.
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.801]  One, two.
[00:03:48.382 --> 00:03:49.563]  This is so frustrating.
[00:03:54.086 --> 00:03:55.607]  Now we will kill the infidel.
[00:04:01.632 --> 00:04:10.758]  You have to make them believe us.
[00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:13.180]  ISIS!
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.961]  The Caliphate!
[00:04:24.488 --> 00:04:26.590]  I find your lack of faith disturbing.
[00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:47.706]  2015 is almost here, and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform your body the way you want it.
[00:04:47.926 --> 00:04:51.730]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.975]  Make this year different by equipping yourself with Oxy Powder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[00:04:58.336 --> 00:05:04.141]  Using Super Oxygenation Oxy Powder, available through Infowarslife.com, gently cleanses the body
[00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:06.222]  While you sleep with easy capsules.
[00:05:06.562 --> 00:05:12.245]  Tens of thousands of individuals have used Oxy-Powder to cleanse their bodies and aid in their transformations.
[00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:17.947]  Even InfoWars Nightly News Director Rob Dew has been using Oxy-Powder with incredible success.
[00:05:18.267 --> 00:05:20.628]  Took it that first day, then I took it for six more days after that.
[00:05:20.788 --> 00:05:22.629]  Twelve pounds melted off in about a week.
[00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:23.249]  I'd say a week.
[00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:24.430]  Seven days.
[00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.051]  2015 can be different.
[00:05:26.151 --> 00:05:29.052]  Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[00:05:29.372 --> 00:05:31.176]  Oxy-Powder flushes it out.
[00:05:31.576 --> 00:05:34.262]  Secure your Oxy-Powder at Infowarslife.com.
