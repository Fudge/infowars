[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.682]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:25.944]  It is Friday, March 27th, 2015 and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:27.846]  Here are tonight's top stories.
[00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:44.207]  The secrets behind the DEA's sex parties and media outlets continue to lie about InfoWars coverage of Operation Jade Helm.
[00:00:44.347 --> 00:00:45.068]  Let's go back to the clip.
[00:00:45.088 --> 00:00:45.729]  You're a fat liar!
[00:01:01.476 --> 00:01:05.017]  Well, this Jade Helm story has gone completely viral.
[00:01:05.158 --> 00:01:07.599]  That's how you know that we are over the target.
[00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:14.982]  People can sense that something isn't right, and that's why this story has been forced into the mainstream.
[00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:17.403]  Different outlets are covering it in different ways.
[00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:20.844]  We've got the Daily Mail, which is based out of the UK.
[00:01:21.464 --> 00:01:28.947]  They do a lot of really great reporting there, and they did a fair job covering this massive military training exercise.
[00:01:29.347 --> 00:01:30.188]  They explain
[00:01:30.768 --> 00:01:34.151]  That's quite the contrary to how Fox News covered this story.
[00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:38.554]  Fox News decided that they would cover the Jade Helm military exercise but they did a total whitewash
[00:01:55.526 --> 00:02:07.528]  They've refused to identify Alex Jones or InfoWars by name and they just gave it a quick little minute and a half sort of, oh yeah, this is happening, but oh, don't even worry about it.
[00:02:07.608 --> 00:02:08.189]  Here's a clip.
[00:02:08.948 --> 00:02:14.993]  The goal is to see if groups of these special forces can move around the civilian population without being noticed.
[00:02:15.053 --> 00:02:21.559]  You know, blend in so they can place themselves in strategic positions to handle different threat scenarios.
[00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.103]  The military says these are vital skills when it comes to an ever-changing threat.
[00:02:26.403 --> 00:02:32.288]  But in the slideshow of the training exercise, it says Texas will be simulated hostile territory.
[00:02:32.608 --> 00:02:37.052]  While that hostile characterization didn't sit well with a far-right radio host in Austin,
[00:02:37.432 --> 00:02:55.588]  So they gave it about a minute there on the Kelly file, so they can say, we covered the exercise, we told you there was going to be a massive military training exercise, but of course they said it sort of tongue-in-cheek, you know, oh it's just the military, they want to see if they can blend in with the civilian population, no big deal.
[00:02:55.788 --> 00:03:02.854]  Mint Press News also covered it, and I actually like a lot of the reporting that they do as well, but their article is titled, The Truth Behind
[00:03:03.314 --> 00:03:10.462]  Jade Helm won five, they say the conspiracy theories probably aren't as interesting as the truth, and they actually...
[00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:13.421]  Break down the military jargon there.
[00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:18.826]  They go on to sort of explain exactly what's happening with the drill.
[00:03:19.387 --> 00:03:32.641]  But then they say, so America's special forces will most likely have to evade capture by local law enforcement, suspicious citizens, and whatever military unit is turned loose to try to catch them.
[00:03:33.081 --> 00:03:34.863]  So here they're basically spelling it out.
[00:03:35.143 --> 00:03:36.984]  They're going to be in your neighborhoods.
[00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:39.066]  You're going to get a lot of suspicious activity calls.
[00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:43.749]  You're going to see a lot of military helicopters picking people up, dropping people off.
[00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.551]  If they find some sniper hiding in your land.
[00:03:47.192 --> 00:03:49.793]  And then they go on, they say, well, why the big secret?
[00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:59.660]  These training exercises are not discussed because America's most elite units will most likely be committing a slew of minor crimes along the way.
[00:04:00.481 --> 00:04:10.052]  They will certainly trespass, they'll engage in petty theft, sneak onto trains, hide in the back of an 18-wheeler, and they might even steal a car.
[00:04:10.633 --> 00:04:15.639]  This training is absolutely necessary for these troops' survival in extreme situations.
[00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:20.384]  However, the public reaction to the above wouldn't be favorable.
[00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:21.702]  You think?
[00:04:22.543 --> 00:04:34.499]  And so this is why we think it's really important that people, especially in states like Texas where everyone's got a gun at home, should probably be aware of the fact that there is a huge training exercise going on.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.961]  What happens if
[00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:36.521]  I think so.
[00:04:57.961 --> 00:05:01.443]  They have to be dealing with these hostile territories.
[00:05:01.844 --> 00:05:08.028]  So forgive us if we think it's important that the military is training in civilian areas.
[00:05:08.328 --> 00:05:10.410]  Forgive us if we think that this is odd.
[00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.012]  And of course they're also working alongside local law enforcement.
[00:05:14.453 --> 00:05:15.854]  That's a big issue.
[00:05:16.354 --> 00:05:23.223]  They would love to see the law enforcement be federalized and everything be under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:25.986]  Of course, the states then wouldn't be in control.
[00:05:26.287 --> 00:05:28.369]  It would be whoever is the commander-in-chief.
[00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.374]  Let's hope he's not a tyrannical dictator coming up in the next election.
[00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:37.399]  Now, Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson put together an extensive report.
[00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:42.543]  It's called Beyond Denial, Preparations for Martial Law in America.
[00:05:42.603 --> 00:05:43.924]  It's very important.
[00:05:43.984 --> 00:05:46.226]  Make sure you share that with everyone.
[00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:48.368]  It goes on to list
[00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:51.630]  Everything from the government documents.
[00:05:52.291 --> 00:05:54.633]  And this isn't something that we're making up.
[00:05:54.793 --> 00:05:58.336]  We're not saying that martial law is set to hit the country July 15th.
[00:05:58.656 --> 00:06:02.239]  We're saying these are preparations for what is coming to America.
[00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:05.261]  It's been heavily documented for decades.
[00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:07.723]  Alex Jones has been covering this for decades.
[00:06:08.103 --> 00:06:13.348]  And we really take it for granted here in America that we don't have a permanent military presence.
[00:06:14.028 --> 00:06:28.420]  But the way that our leaders have been provoking nuclear war with Russia, and we're roaring about the dollar devaluing with China taking over, and the way they've been really pumping out this rhetoric from the military-industrial complex,
[00:06:29.201 --> 00:06:31.462]  You know, things could change here soon.
[00:06:31.602 --> 00:06:37.324]  We might have a permanent military presence and that's all we're saying is that they have been prepping America for this.
[00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:39.664]  So that is a very important article.
[00:06:39.985 --> 00:06:42.285]  Be sure to share that with all of your contacts.
[00:06:42.926 --> 00:06:46.467]  It has all those government documents that you need to just let people know that
[00:06:47.267 --> 00:06:48.808]  That this is something that's legit.
[00:06:49.028 --> 00:06:55.693]  Coming up after the show, after the interview, Joe Biggs has a response to all of the Jade Helm haters.
[00:06:56.193 --> 00:06:59.835]  And again, he was the one that brought this article here to InfoWars.
[00:07:00.216 --> 00:07:06.920]  But not only is this a message to the military, to law enforcement, but it's also a message to Americans.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.021]  Wake up!
[00:07:08.641 --> 00:07:13.823]  We have people who are actively signing petitions to get mandatory vaccines.
[00:07:14.203 --> 00:07:21.965]  As well, there are people petitioning to get a reporter fired for simply showing her bias toward the Constitution.
[00:07:22.246 --> 00:07:23.706]  So this is what we're having to deal with.
[00:07:24.066 --> 00:07:25.427]  All of that is coming right up.
[00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:29.168]  The good news is, is that we do have some good guys on the inside.
[00:07:30.723 --> 00:07:39.990]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.794]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.

[00:08:29.066 --> 00:08:37.090]  The knowledge of the ancients, tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts, fused with the latest
[00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:51.664]  Nutraceutical Science introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge and prepare your body for what experts admit is the most dangerous season of the year.

[00:09:00.293 --> 00:09:00.613]  We're good.
[00:09:39.793 --> 00:09:42.315]  Jakari Jackson here for InfoWars.com.
[00:09:42.695 --> 00:09:51.061]  Now, I've reported on a lot of gun stories, and I guess my unique position here at InfoWars allows me to be simultaneously a reporter as well as a pundit.
[00:09:51.561 --> 00:09:54.323]  But some people take offense to this, not so much my reporting.
[00:09:54.363 --> 00:09:57.565]  I'm sure they wouldn't give you their opinion of my reporting if they got a chance.
[00:09:57.925 --> 00:09:59.946]  But now we have an article out of Guns.com.
[00:10:00.427 --> 00:10:03.909]  Gun control group petitions stationed to fire pro-gun reporter.
[00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.711]  And this is the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.
[00:10:07.071 --> 00:10:09.373]  They have an issue with one Emily Miller.
[00:10:10.334 --> 00:10:16.340]  And the coalition is basically saying that Emily is not a real reporter, she's a pundit because she has pro-gun views.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:23.167]  And the group went on to say, by the standards of her profession, Emily Miller has no business calling herself a journalist.
[00:10:23.347 --> 00:10:24.749]  Miller's crusade against D.C.'
[00:10:24.729 --> 00:10:29.694]  's popular democratically enacted gun laws has been a professional one since the beginning.
[00:10:30.114 --> 00:10:38.100]  At this point, the city's residents have no reasonable expectation that she will provide objective, impartial coverage on matters of concern to them.
[00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:45.166]  If Miller wishes to behave like a pundit and activist, then WTTG should replace her with a real journalist.
[00:10:45.626 --> 00:10:51.969]  Well, first of all, I would like to address this anti-gun group and tell them that yes, you are allowed to have opinions in the United States of America.
[00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:54.551]  Secondly, I would like to address something that they said.
[00:10:54.971 --> 00:10:56.632]  Miller's crusade against D.C.'
[00:10:56.612 --> 00:11:02.255]  's popular, that's debatable, democratically enacted gun laws has been a professional one since the beginning.
[00:11:02.875 --> 00:11:07.538]  Well, this democratically enacted gun law, let's explore this statement.
[00:11:08.018 --> 00:11:09.760]  Specifically with the case of D.C.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.581]  vs. Heller.
[00:11:10.861 --> 00:11:15.066]  The Supreme Court struck down provisions of the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975 as unconstitutional.
[00:11:17.631 --> 00:11:20.973]  And basically says that you can own a gun in the District of Columbia.
[00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:22.514]  And actually, it's my understanding that Ms.
[00:11:22.574 --> 00:11:32.161]  Miller became a gun proponent or a Second Amendment proponent, as she likes to call herself, because she realized how difficult it was to get a firearms license in the District of Columbia.
[00:11:32.601 --> 00:11:36.744]  And you guys probably recall Adam Kokesh being arrested for having a loaded shotgun.
[00:11:36.984 --> 00:11:47.331]  Well, with the Firearms Act of 1975 being deemed unconstitutional, yes, Adam Kokesh could have a loaded firearm in the District of Columbia just like he could have one here in the state of Texas.
[00:11:47.751 --> 00:11:56.135]  So, for this group to go out here and espouse these views, saying that this is a democratically enacted gun law, they should probably do their research before trying to get somebody fired.
[00:11:56.435 --> 00:12:00.636]  I support you, Emily, and hope that you have a very long career, if not there, someplace else.
[00:12:01.077 --> 00:12:03.978]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:12.788 --> 00:12:18.551]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:12:18.891 --> 00:12:23.173]  Introducing the new InfoWarsLife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.
[00:12:23.473 --> 00:12:31.196]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.

[00:12:58.371 --> 00:13:03.373]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:07.074]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[00:13:07.254 --> 00:13:09.175]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:13:23.365 --> 00:13:33.073]  If mainstream media doesn't cover it all up, expect hearings and scandal as the Justice Department is announcing DEA sex parties in Colombia.
[00:13:33.413 --> 00:13:34.674]  But it's nothing new.
[00:13:34.894 --> 00:13:46.023]  You may remember that a couple dozen Secret Service agents and military men were caught up in a prostitution scandal last month for bringing prostitutes back to this hotel as they were preparing for the President's trip there.
[00:13:46.424 --> 00:13:50.387]  The DEA incident happened around the same time, not at this location.
[00:13:50.467 --> 00:13:51.848]  It's a separate investigation.
[00:13:52.108 --> 00:14:04.037]  Senator Susan Collins, the ranking Republican on the Homeland Security Committee, says she was briefed on the DEA probe over two weeks ago, but was asked to keep it quiet until the agents were taken out of Colombia and questioned.
[00:14:04.097 --> 00:14:10.221]  The DEA's Office of Professional Responsibility became aware of the DEA's Colombian sex parties in 2010.
[00:14:11.742 --> 00:14:15.864]  But the DEA Colombian sex parties had taken place from 2005 to 2008.
[00:14:16.604 --> 00:14:23.008]  The Inspector General's office discovered that the DEA didn't fully cooperate with the investigation.
[00:14:23.468 --> 00:14:31.972]  The DEA Colombian sex parties were a replete with prostitutes provided by Colombian drug cartels and conducted at the DEA's office in Bogota.
[00:14:32.452 --> 00:14:36.676]  Three DEA special agents were gifted cash and expensive weapons.
[00:14:37.137 --> 00:14:49.188]  Foreign officers alleged that they watched over the DEA's weapons while the DEA officers were enjoying the fringe benefits of being the muscle for a monopolized billion dollar drug trade behemoth.
[00:14:49.369 --> 00:14:54.373]  We see a lot of the big banks caught laundering drug money and they don't even get in trouble or they get a tiny fine.
[00:14:55.174 --> 00:15:07.544]  Yeah, you know, it's terribly unfortunate that the Department of Justice has taken the position that they're going to just slap the hands of international banks that are very, very aggressively involved in laundering criminal proceeds.
[00:15:08.265 --> 00:15:13.729]  There's plenty of examples, but we'll take the most recent one, which is HSBC, Hong Kong Shanghai Bank Corporation.
[00:15:13.749 --> 00:15:15.331]  Sounds like a far away bank, but it's not.
[00:15:16.151 --> 00:15:21.776]  Second largest bank in the world, based in the UK, but they had 400 plus branches in the United States.
[00:15:22.256 --> 00:15:23.697]  They profess to be the world's bank.
[00:15:24.377 --> 00:15:24.697]  They are.
[00:15:25.197 --> 00:15:29.399]  And they also have quite a banking network in Mexico.
[00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:44.766]  And between the New York and the Mexican offices of HSBC, by their own admission, they committed a criminal offense in connection with their movement of nearly a billion dollars in drug proceeds for the Sinaloa cartel and the Norte de Valle cartel.
[00:15:44.786 --> 00:15:47.507]  Those are the largest in Mexico and in Colombia.
[00:15:47.807 --> 00:15:51.529]  Colombia is a major hub for the global sex trafficking network.
[00:15:51.972 --> 00:16:01.981]  Allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct are also being uncovered pertaining to the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, and the U.S.
[00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:02.882]  Marshal's Office.
[00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:05.644]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:16:14.028 --> 00:16:15.269]  Another major health threat.
[00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:20.191]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:22.912]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:16:22.952 --> 00:16:29.714]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:16:29.995 --> 00:16:32.836]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:16:32.976 --> 00:16:35.897]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.

[00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:27.371]  Well, we are witnessing a time of political upheaval, a staggering economy, wars and rumors of wars everywhere.
[00:17:27.431 --> 00:17:31.733]  And in fact, we're even seeing some auspicious signs in the heavens.
[00:17:32.393 --> 00:17:41.096]  Is there an ancient mystery that lies behind everything that we're witnessing from the rise and fall of the stock market to the rise and fall of nations?
[00:17:41.516 --> 00:17:44.960]  Well, my guest today hopes to possibly answer that question.
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:49.886]  This is Jonathan Cahn, and he's the author of two New York Times bestseller books.
[00:17:50.426 --> 00:17:54.451]  The first is The Harbinger, and then his new book, The Mystery of the Shemitah.
[00:17:55.272 --> 00:18:00.738]  It predicts a biblical pattern which indicates that financial collapse may be coming in 2015.
[00:18:03.612 --> 00:18:06.253]  So Jonathan, thank you so much for joining the show today.
[00:18:06.273 --> 00:18:11.096]  Now I wanted to talk to you a little bit about, I've seen some other interviews that you've done.
[00:18:11.276 --> 00:18:17.900]  You sort of mentioned that you didn't really want to write this book, The Mystery of the Shemitah, because you weren't really interested in setting up
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:19.020]  I think so.
[00:18:42.853 --> 00:18:58.204]  Yeah, the Harbinger is framed in a story, but it's something very real, and it's a mystery that goes back to the last days of ancient Israel, when nine prophetic warnings appear in the land, and they are warning the nation of destruction, and the nation
[00:18:58.744 --> 00:18:59.064]  Thank you.
[00:19:13.915 --> 00:19:16.576]  Since the book came out, they've continued to manifest.
[00:19:16.616 --> 00:19:24.058]  They are precise, they are exact, and they are warning that America is now the nation in danger of coming calamity.
[00:19:24.078 --> 00:19:26.518]  So that's what the Harbinger reveals.
[00:19:26.718 --> 00:19:31.660]  And from that, one of the mysteries that comes out of that is called the Shemitah.
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.840]  So that's how the mystery of the Shemitah began.
[00:19:34.941 --> 00:19:37.861]  And then, so what is the mystery of the Shemitah?
[00:19:38.321 --> 00:19:39.842]  And has it begun?
[00:19:40.447 --> 00:20:00.379]  Yeah, the Mystery of the Shemitah is a 3,000-year-old mystery from the Bible that actually lies behind everything from the rise and fall of the economy, the rise and fall of Wall Street, when Wall Street collapses, the rise and fall of nations, even the rise of America and what may be the fall of America.
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:11.708]  So precise that it as far as I know it's the only thing in existence that actually gives the exact dates of when things happen down to the hours down to the seconds.
[00:20:11.748 --> 00:20:15.772]  I mean literally forecasting the exact crashing days of Wall Street.
[00:20:16.172 --> 00:20:19.294]  It also is really the key for those who know about end time prophecy.
[00:20:19.334 --> 00:20:26.160]  It's also the key that's also the missing key of things that are happening from Israel to major world events and
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.662]  So this mystery of the Shemitah has been affecting our lives from the moment we were born.
[00:20:30.743 --> 00:20:34.845]  Really affecting from our bank accounts to world history itself.
[00:20:35.105 --> 00:20:37.666]  And we are in a Shemitah year right now.
[00:20:37.707 --> 00:20:39.648]  That's one of the reasons I don't want people to focus on dates.
[00:20:39.728 --> 00:20:42.449]  I do give dates, but it's a bigger principle.
[00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:47.532]  So this mystery begins actually on Mount Sinai when the law comes.
[00:20:47.592 --> 00:20:48.793]  It's called the Law of the Shemitah.
[00:20:48.833 --> 00:20:50.614]  And basically to understand it, it's this.
[00:20:51.235 --> 00:20:53.558]  Every seven years was a Sabbath year.
[00:20:53.578 --> 00:20:54.859]  It's called the Shemitah.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.584]  And during that year, there was no reaping, no sowing of the land.
[00:20:58.624 --> 00:20:59.805]  Everything came to a rest.
[00:21:00.186 --> 00:21:05.312]  And on the last day of the Shemitah, the last day was called in Hebrew, was called Elul 29.
[00:21:05.352 --> 00:21:05.813]  That is the
[00:21:07.134 --> 00:21:11.376]  The 29th day of the month of Elul, on that day comes a wipeout.
[00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:16.299]  All debt is wiped out, all credits wiped out, all the financial accounts are wiped clean.
[00:21:16.759 --> 00:21:29.566]  Now, the Shemitah was supposed to be a blessing, but when Israel turned away from God, the Shemitah comes back, not as a blessing, but as a sign of judgment on a nation that has once known God, but now is driving God out of its life.
[00:21:29.746 --> 00:21:32.868]  And this ultimately would lead to the destruction of Israel.
[00:21:32.928 --> 00:21:34.609]  So the question here is, could this
[00:21:35.189 --> 00:21:37.630]  Ancient mystery, the Shemitah, still be in effect?
[00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:39.431]  Could it be affecting us right now?
[00:21:39.671 --> 00:21:43.573]  Could it be a warning with what is happening in America?
[00:21:43.773 --> 00:21:47.955]  And the answer, and that's why I wrote the book The Mystery of the Shemitah, the answer is incredibly yes.
[00:21:48.055 --> 00:21:52.977]  It's in effect, it's affecting us, it has affected us, it is affecting us, and I believe it will affect us.
[00:21:53.493 --> 00:21:53.593]  Yeah.
[00:22:15.038 --> 00:22:20.100]  Have knowledge of this and rig the stock markets with that knowledge?
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:27.243]  We've got an article up on InfoWars now talking about that the rigging is no longer a conspiracy theory.
[00:22:27.443 --> 00:22:30.304]  Like, now they're saying, wow, this is actually something that's happening.
[00:22:30.364 --> 00:22:35.166]  So could that be something else that could be exploited?
[00:22:36.038 --> 00:22:38.061]  Well, I think a few things.
[00:22:38.121 --> 00:22:41.846]  I mean, you know, there can be those things, and there certainly are people who rig the markets.
[00:22:43.147 --> 00:22:52.239]  And yet, this thing has been happening, I mean, for not only the last four years, it's actually been happening since, I mean, over a century, you can see it.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:59.948]  It is happening so exactly that even if people try to rig the markets, first of all, most of them are not religious or they're not following the Bible, number one.
[00:23:00.309 --> 00:23:06.316]  Number two, you could not make everything happen down, I mean, to the day and happening so exactly.
[00:23:06.376 --> 00:23:08.479]  Most people on Wall Street don't understand the Shemitah.
[00:23:08.859 --> 00:23:12.704]  You know, when I wrote the book, people from Wall Street were contacting me and saying,
[00:23:13.084 --> 00:23:21.812]  Some of them are saying there is a seven-year cycle, and when I looked after the book, they actually are identifying the seven-year cycle on the time of the Shemitah.
[00:23:22.093 --> 00:23:23.574]  But they have no idea what the Shemitah is.
[00:23:23.654 --> 00:23:25.216]  So, I'd say it's bigger than that.
[00:23:25.276 --> 00:23:27.358]  There are conspiracies, but this is bigger than that.
[00:23:27.758 --> 00:23:36.266]  When you look at the last 40 years, it's the greatest crashes or the collapsing of Wall Street, the long-term collapses, are the years 1973, 1980.
[00:23:38.988 --> 00:23:39.989]  87, 2000 and 2007.
[00:23:40.609 --> 00:23:43.711]  Every single one of them happens on a seven-year cycle.
[00:23:43.751 --> 00:23:44.372]  That's the Shemitah.
[00:23:44.752 --> 00:23:47.193]  Every single one of them happens at the time of the Shemitah.
[00:23:47.553 --> 00:23:55.618]  But not only that, if you look at the greatest collapses in world history, I mean, just in modern times, the top three, which is number three, is 1937-1938.
[00:23:55.638 --> 00:23:56.379]  That's the year of the Shemitah.
[00:23:59.201 --> 00:24:03.206]  Uh, number two is 2007-2008, the Great Recession, Year of the Shemitah.
[00:24:03.506 --> 00:24:07.812]  Number one is the Depression, greatest year is 1930-31, Year of the Shemitah.
[00:24:07.992 --> 00:24:10.596]  Every single one happens in this time period.
[00:24:10.696 --> 00:24:14.822]  And it even gets more precise because actually there's a certain time of the year
[00:24:15.402 --> 00:24:20.527]  When these things have to collapse biblically, the time of the year is called the month of Tishri.
[00:24:20.567 --> 00:24:28.694]  That's the time that actually closes the Shemitah, this seven-year cycle, so it's the time that manifests this wipeout that comes at the end.
[00:24:28.994 --> 00:24:31.436]  Well, if you look at the greatest day crashes
[00:24:31.696 --> 00:24:32.116]  We're good to go.
[00:24:57.675 --> 00:25:05.219]  The amazing thing is this phenomenon, or actually 2008, this phenomenon is getting more and more precise and more and more powerful or stunning.
[00:25:05.319 --> 00:25:09.401]  For example, 2001, 9-11 happens.
[00:25:09.601 --> 00:25:12.903]  It causes the greatest point crash in world history.
[00:25:13.263 --> 00:25:14.664]  Well, when does that take place?
[00:25:14.704 --> 00:25:15.224]  It's September 17, 2001.
[00:25:15.284 --> 00:25:15.984]  That's the greatest crash.
[00:25:17.905 --> 00:25:18.625]  What day is that?
[00:25:18.725 --> 00:25:24.687]  That date is Elul 29, the exact day of the Shemitah that comes once every seven years.
[00:25:25.027 --> 00:25:30.889]  That's the day appointed to wipe out the financial realm in the Bible, the exact day, and it's a sign of judgment.
[00:25:31.209 --> 00:25:35.750]  If you go seven years into the future and you find you have the other greatest crash
[00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:40.775]  In World History, to this day, September 29, 2008, greatest crash ever.
[00:25:41.095 --> 00:25:41.996]  When does that take place?
[00:25:42.416 --> 00:25:49.623]  On September 29th, in the Biblical calendar, it's Elul 29, the exact same Biblical day that comes once every seven years.
[00:25:49.663 --> 00:25:52.266]  So the two greatest crashes in World History
[00:25:52.686 --> 00:26:03.689]  Each happen exactly seven biblical years apart, down to the day, down to the hour, the minute, the second, on the day that's appointed, once in seven years, to wipe out the financial realm.
[00:26:03.729 --> 00:26:04.750]  So, I mean, this is stunning.
[00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:08.091]  I don't believe, no matter what, anybody could have put this thing together.
[00:26:08.111 --> 00:26:11.752]  I mean, that's how precise it is, down to the day and down to the seconds.
[00:26:12.233 --> 00:26:12.473]  Right.
[00:26:13.173 --> 00:26:21.495]  Well, I mean, I've definitely, just from my own experience reading the Bible, I've noticed how, you know, we still sort of see that with our banking.
[00:26:21.555 --> 00:26:24.955]  You have bankruptcies clear themselves after seven years.
[00:26:25.015 --> 00:26:30.356]  Your credit report, you know, bad things on your credit seem to be wiped away after a seven year period.
[00:26:30.756 --> 00:26:34.997]  So we see this is still something that's been in play for a long time.
[00:26:35.017 --> 00:26:39.938]  Now, you mentioned that it's supposed to be a blessing to wipe away this debt.
[00:26:39.978 --> 00:26:41.018]  But here when we see these
[00:26:41.958 --> 00:26:45.060]  Economic crashes, who is benefiting from that?
[00:26:45.841 --> 00:26:48.523]  Yeah, well that's, you know, it is, there's two sides, that's right.
[00:26:48.543 --> 00:26:49.604]  There are two sides to the Shemitah.
[00:26:49.684 --> 00:26:52.966]  It's supposed to be a blessing, and a nation that follows God, there's a blessing.
[00:26:53.026 --> 00:27:04.435]  But, if a nation that has known God, like America, which is very, very much a parallel to Israel, turns away from God, the Shemitah turns and becomes a sign of judgment, actually comes by force.
[00:27:04.475 --> 00:27:11.140]  So yeah, you have, instead of a good wiping away of debts, you have crashes, you have recessions, you have all these things.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:21.611]  But the thing is even bigger, because not only does this affect the economy, but this actually determines the rising and the falling of nations, and that's why it's very significant with America.
[00:27:21.711 --> 00:27:27.798]  Because if you look at the word shmita in Hebrew, it can mean the shaking or the fall or the collapse.
[00:27:28.178 --> 00:27:29.858]  Well, one of the years of the Shemitah was 1917.
[00:27:30.059 --> 00:27:35.720]  That year is a year of a great, I mean, cataclysmic, global shaking.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.681]  World War I, the greatest shaking to that day.
[00:27:38.361 --> 00:27:39.401]  That's the turning point year.
[00:27:39.441 --> 00:27:43.402]  That's the year that America enters the war, begins its rise to superpower.
[00:27:43.762 --> 00:27:50.764]  You watch, you know, at this time, you've got the collapse of kingdoms, collapse of empires during the time of the Shemitah, and you have the rise of America.
[00:27:51.184 --> 00:27:57.309]  Well, if you fast forward four Shemitahs, or 28 years, it takes you to the Shemitah of 1945.
[00:27:57.529 --> 00:28:00.852]  Another global cataclysm, another world shaking.
[00:28:01.212 --> 00:28:06.096]  In fact, the conflict actually begins in 1938 with Hitler seizing Europe.
[00:28:06.576 --> 00:28:08.898]  1938 is the year of the Shemitah.
[00:28:09.639 --> 00:28:11.740]  The war follows the cycle of the Shemitah.
[00:28:12.041 --> 00:28:15.123]  The Shemitah ends 1945, first week of September.
[00:28:15.423 --> 00:28:17.345]  World War II ends the same week.
[00:28:17.865 --> 00:28:26.313]  It ushers in the collapse of power and the rise of power, the rise of America to superpower, the Cold War, new economic world order, everything.
[00:28:26.633 --> 00:28:32.879]  So, I mean, and actually this is followed down, even the year 2001, year of the Shemitah, actually means shaking.
[00:28:32.959 --> 00:28:38.864]  And when the Shemitah reaches its greatest, its last week, that's the week heading to that wipeout day.
[00:28:39.264 --> 00:28:40.945]  Well, you've got 9-11 comes in.
[00:28:41.045 --> 00:28:43.366]  You literally have, you know, Shemitah can mean the fall or the collapse.
[00:28:43.386 --> 00:28:48.067]  You literally have the fall or the collapse of towers representing America's glory.
[00:28:48.367 --> 00:28:54.469]  This is a warning in the Bible of, you know, there's a thing in the book called the Mystery of the Towers.
[00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:58.931]  And one of the things is that the rising of towers actually links to the rise of power.
[00:28:59.311 --> 00:29:01.512]  What does the fall of towers foreshadow of?
[00:29:02.092 --> 00:29:08.377]  All these things are coming together and the warning of the Shemitah is that the nation drives away God, the God of its blessings.
[00:29:08.518 --> 00:29:14.743]  Those blessings will end and the American age will end as we know it and we are again in one right now.
[00:29:15.734 --> 00:29:25.117]  And so you're saying that the Shemitah year has begun now, so has anything come about this year that you've seen?
[00:29:25.137 --> 00:29:27.298]  Yeah, well, a few things.
[00:29:27.358 --> 00:29:34.760]  First of all, when the Shemitah began, I mean, we're right now in the center of it, and again, I'm not, you know, one of the things is why I want to be careful.
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:35.901]  I don't want people setting dates.
[00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:36.961]  Nothing has to happen.
[00:29:37.001 --> 00:29:38.321]  We can't put God in a box.
[00:29:38.361 --> 00:29:39.382]  Nothing has to happen every time.
[00:29:40.662 --> 00:29:42.945]  In view of what has happened, I would be aware of it.
[00:29:43.005 --> 00:29:46.148]  First of all, a very major thing happened that escaped most people.
[00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:59.863]  The Shemitah began in the autumn of 2014 and what happened is within two weeks, well actually within one week of it beginning, and remember the Shemitah can mean the fall, within one week America was overtaken, Russia became the
[00:30:00.223 --> 00:30:01.145]  We're good.
[00:30:17.547 --> 00:30:27.573]  Now I've warned, since the Harbinger came out, I've warned that if we don't turn back to God, there is going to be the crown that America has worn as the head of nation is going to be removed.
[00:30:34.617 --> 00:30:37.018]  We are seeing the beginning of that right now.
[00:30:37.419 --> 00:30:44.282]  And so we are watching, actually, when the same week that the Shemitah began, Wall Street went crazy for about a month.
[00:30:44.362 --> 00:30:52.846]  Now, the pattern of the last Shemitahs have been that often at the beginning of the Shemitah, you don't notice anything, but there are often foreshadows.
[00:30:52.887 --> 00:30:59.530]  Well, the major thing, if something's going to happen, the major period is going to be coming up, is that always at the end of the Shemitah,
[00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.891]  As we approach September, that's the time of that wipeout.
[00:31:03.151 --> 00:31:06.152]  I'm not saying it has to happen, but I believe we need to be aware of it.
[00:31:06.552 --> 00:31:14.814]  And interesting, people who look at signs, one of the signs in the Bible of judgment is the darkening of the sun, or an eclipse.
[00:31:15.134 --> 00:31:16.595]  Not that it always is, but it can be.
[00:31:17.055 --> 00:31:24.117]  On the day that we get to the wipeout day, Elul 29, of this Shemitah cycle, the sun's going to be darkened at that time.
[00:31:24.717 --> 00:31:29.801]  The last time that happened was 1987, when the sun was darkened at Al-Ul 29.
[00:31:30.641 --> 00:31:34.144]  It led into Black Monday, the worst day crash in world history.
[00:31:34.804 --> 00:31:35.985]  I believe we are going to watch.
[00:31:36.025 --> 00:31:48.433]  If we don't turn back, if this nation keeps on going on its course, we're going to watch the fall of America, or the shaking of America, and the American age that you and I and all our listeners have known since we were born is going to come to an end.
[00:31:48.674 --> 00:31:53.577]  And the Shemitah is very exact, very precise, and I believe this is a real warning that we need to be ready.
[00:31:54.813 --> 00:32:14.580]  Right, and I know a lot of our audience was pretty interested in the fact that there was this phenomenon, you know, it's not super rare, but with all of the blood moons and the solar eclipses and everything, and they were coinciding with Jewish holidays, and so is that something that's very significant for you as well?
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:15.801]  Yeah, well, interesting.
[00:32:15.841 --> 00:32:19.983]  I mean, yeah, not to, and I know Mark Biltz, who is the one who came up with the Blood Moon theory.
[00:32:20.263 --> 00:32:25.066]  Well, yeah, not that we want to be dogmatic again that it has to, but I believe it's significant to watch for.
[00:32:25.346 --> 00:32:28.869]  For instance, the majority of the Blood Moon period is the year of the Shemitah.
[00:32:28.889 --> 00:32:29.869]  That's the majority of it.
[00:32:29.949 --> 00:32:32.311]  And when it comes to ahead, guess when it comes to ahead?
[00:32:32.431 --> 00:32:33.251]  It's September 2015.
[00:32:34.392 --> 00:32:34.712]  We're good.
[00:32:50.632 --> 00:32:59.420]  When you get to every seventh Shemitah, or that seven times seven, that's 49 years, it ushers in a super Shemitah that we know it's called the Jubilee.
[00:32:59.601 --> 00:33:04.245]  And the Jubilee, when that happens, everybody is restored to their land.
[00:33:04.285 --> 00:33:11.532]  If you lost your land, you lost your inheritance, you lost your ancestral home, on the Jubilee you return to your home and you get that home back.
[00:33:11.912 --> 00:33:23.097]  Well, one of the things about end-time prophecy, as we're speaking about that, is that we know that end-time prophecy says that Israel has to be restored to the land and to Jerusalem, which it lost 2,000 years ago.
[00:33:23.437 --> 00:33:24.157]  That has to happen.
[00:33:24.537 --> 00:33:31.460]  Well, could this mystery of the 7th Shemitah actually give us the exact times when these prophetic events have to happen?
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.801]  And I'll give you just a taste of it.
[00:33:33.321 --> 00:33:33.722]  Here it is.
[00:33:33.942 --> 00:33:46.230]  The Shemitah or the 7th Shemitah or the Jubilee, this restoration period, has to happen the year after a Shemitah because it's the 50th year and the 49th year or the 7th Shemitah, that's a Shemitah.
[00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:47.271]  So here's the thing.
[00:33:47.631 --> 00:33:50.733]  If you look at the year 1917, you have the year of the Shemitah.
[00:33:51.093 --> 00:33:56.216]  At the end of it would be this prophetic period that begins September 1917 to September 1918.
[00:33:56.816 --> 00:33:59.918]  Did anything significant happen with prophecy or restoration?
[00:33:59.958 --> 00:34:01.299]  Well, here's the amazing thing.
[00:34:01.579 --> 00:34:14.766]  In that exact period, Britain is winning the First World War, the Ottoman Empire crashes, the land of Israel goes to Britain, Britain issues the Balfour Declaration, gives the land back to the Jewish people,
[00:34:15.186 --> 00:34:30.931]  In the Restoration, the Jubilee coming back to the land in the exact time period, and if you count seven Shemitahs later to the next seven Shemitahs, it takes you to, it gives you the period that is 1966 September to 1967 September.
[00:34:31.271 --> 00:34:37.733]  Right in the middle of that comes the next prophetic Restoration, the Six-Day War, when Israel regains Jerusalem.
[00:34:37.833 --> 00:34:44.695]  Well, here's the thing, I'm not being dogmatic, I'm not saying it has to be, but if we follow this one more time, where does it take us?
[00:34:45.095 --> 00:34:55.604]  It takes us to the Shemitah that we're in right now, that's the 7th Shemitah, and the period of prophetic restoration would be September 2015 to September 2016.
[00:34:57.046 --> 00:35:08.456]  Now again, not being dogmatic, but if it follows the pattern of what happened before, it would mean war, war in the Middle East, and a war resulting in the next piece or puzzle piece of prophecy.
[00:35:09.096 --> 00:35:10.018]  This is so big.
[00:35:10.058 --> 00:35:15.989]  I mean, we're talking about from our pocketbooks, our bank accounts, to America, to prophecy, to the end times.
[00:35:16.029 --> 00:35:17.712]  So it's very specific.
[00:35:17.772 --> 00:35:18.554]  It's very exact.
[00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:22.611]  Yeah, and we're definitely seeing that happening.
[00:35:22.631 --> 00:35:23.972]  A lot of downplay here.
[00:35:24.012 --> 00:35:28.255]  We've got major military exercise going on across America.
[00:35:28.415 --> 00:35:29.316]  People prepping.
[00:35:30.296 --> 00:35:37.721]  You know, we see the elite are kind of building up bases and bunkers in New Zealand and countries far away.
[00:35:37.741 --> 00:35:38.802]  A lot of civil unrest.
[00:35:39.202 --> 00:35:43.643]  So, we're sort of seeing the signs, but we're also seeing the signs in the heavens as well.
[00:35:45.063 --> 00:35:47.364]  Now, what do you suggest people do?
[00:35:47.584 --> 00:35:49.904]  Is there something that people should do to prepare for this?
[00:35:50.004 --> 00:35:51.984]  I mean, we're seeing the writing on the wall.
[00:35:52.405 --> 00:35:53.845]  Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:35:54.065 --> 00:35:55.505]  I'll give a few quick things.
[00:35:55.665 --> 00:35:57.826]  One is, I mean, I'm not a financial analyst, but I would say this.
[00:35:58.226 --> 00:36:04.987]  Personally, I would not feel safe putting my investment in the stock market at this time, number one.
[00:36:05.507 --> 00:36:08.068]  I believe that safety is wise.
[00:36:08.468 --> 00:36:17.712]  I believe it's also wise to have a store of essentials if, for instance, if things broke down, if services broke down, that you'd be okay.
[00:36:17.732 --> 00:36:19.033]  I think that's wise anyway.
[00:36:19.433 --> 00:36:22.274]  Beyond that, and I'm going to give you really the highest answer, is this.
[00:36:22.694 --> 00:36:25.236]  When people say, you know, I want to be, I want safety, you know, what should I do?
[00:36:25.256 --> 00:36:26.157]  Should I build a bunker?
[00:36:26.177 --> 00:36:30.820]  Well, in Hebrew, the word for safety is Yeshua, and Yeshua is Jesus.
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:39.106]  So, the ultimate thing is this, listen, no matter if you are outside of Him, and I'm telling you, I'm Jewish, and I'm telling you that if you're outside of Jesus, there's no safety.
[00:36:39.626 --> 00:36:41.047]  The only safety is inside him.
[00:36:41.327 --> 00:36:45.108]  And if you're in him and your life is not right in God's will, get it right.
[00:36:45.528 --> 00:36:46.448]  Get right today.
[00:36:46.528 --> 00:36:48.389]  You know, you don't know how long you have.
[00:36:48.429 --> 00:36:50.309]  And what I'm saying here is the time is late.
[00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:53.510]  We are witnessing things that we have never witnessed in American history.
[00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:55.191]  We're witnessing an apostasy.
[00:36:55.211 --> 00:37:01.132]  We're witnessing a moral decay that the Bible gives very clear answers of what happens when a nation goes this way.
[00:37:01.372 --> 00:37:04.933]  We're witnessing America and Israel, you know, at its worst relationship.
[00:37:04.953 --> 00:37:06.634]  We're witnessing all these things happening fast.
[00:37:07.014 --> 00:37:07.735]  The time is late.
[00:37:07.835 --> 00:37:19.811]  So what I would say is there are many wise things to do, but the most important thing is get right with God, and you don't have to worry, you don't have to fear, because you are in safety, which again in Hebrew is Yeshua, and that's Jesus.
[00:37:20.481 --> 00:37:20.741]  Wow.
[00:37:21.482 --> 00:37:24.924]  Well, Jonathan, where can everyone get your book and stay in touch with you?
[00:37:25.244 --> 00:37:26.665]  Yeah, thank you, Leanne.

[00:37:50.962 --> 00:37:51.864]  Well, thank you so much.

[00:38:28.345 --> 00:38:29.586]  We'll see you here Monday, 7 p.m.
[00:38:29.706 --> 00:38:29.986]  Central.
[00:38:36.041 --> 00:38:43.184]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:38:43.284 --> 00:38:45.465]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:38:45.645 --> 00:38:50.847]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:38:51.007 --> 00:38:56.089]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:38:56.249 --> 00:38:59.350]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:38:59.631 --> 00:39:03.552]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew link to numerous conditions.
[00:39:03.752 --> 00:39:08.074]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:39:08.154 --> 00:39:18.299]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:39:18.499 --> 00:39:21.060]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:29.427]  Manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:39:29.587 --> 00:39:33.590]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:39:46.775 --> 00:39:48.576]  I'm Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, U.S.
[00:39:48.676 --> 00:39:52.117]  Army retired veteran of both Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:39:52.397 --> 00:39:59.900]  Now, I'm here today to dismantle the lies, propaganda, and just blatant BS put out by the mainstream media, the Pentagon.
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:06.022]  All these different sources are just clearly lying about this Operation Jade Helm 1-5.
[00:40:06.302 --> 00:40:09.443]  Now, first off, I want to talk about the Army Times.
[00:40:09.703 --> 00:40:14.685]  Now, in the Army Times, it says that Joe Biggs is cited as a veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq
[00:40:16.386 --> 00:40:21.570]  Um, I'm cited as a U.S.
[00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:22.351]  Army veteran.
[00:40:22.811 --> 00:40:24.913]  Hello, you guys have written about me before.
[00:40:25.413 --> 00:40:30.278]  You can actually go Google my name with Army Times and pull up an article that you yourself did.
[00:40:30.638 --> 00:40:33.340]  Hello, you might want to go fact check yourself before you wreck yourself.
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:35.021]  You guys are supposed to have our backs.
[00:40:35.101 --> 00:40:35.642]  I'm a veteran.
[00:40:35.882 --> 00:40:37.103]  I actually have a purple heart.
[00:40:37.123 --> 00:40:37.864]  Do you know what that is?
[00:40:38.164 --> 00:40:39.585]  You obviously don't know what a veteran is.
[00:40:39.905 --> 00:40:41.167]  This is a purple heart.
[00:40:41.427 --> 00:40:43.889]  So now we're going to talk about the BizPak Review article.
[00:40:44.289 --> 00:40:51.272]  It says that we call this basically a secret document that proved to be bogus, but it hasn't slowed down the storm of conspiracies.
[00:40:51.672 --> 00:40:58.294]  Well, if you go back to March 23rd of last week, there's a video where I bring this Jade Helm 15 document to Alex.
[00:40:58.534 --> 00:41:01.595]  We sit down here at the news desk and we discuss what's going on.
[00:41:01.916 --> 00:41:05.377]  And in the video, you can clearly see that it says unclassified.
[00:41:05.797 --> 00:41:09.640]  Not once have we said secret document in any video.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:10.961]  It's not secret.
[00:41:10.981 --> 00:41:16.205]  It's been hiding in plain sight for anyone to find, except most people don't know what to look for.
[00:41:16.245 --> 00:41:19.427]  And if they did see something like that, they wouldn't know what they were looking at.
[00:41:19.827 --> 00:41:27.913]  We get sent by one of our sources, I'll leave it at that, that, hey, this is hidden behind a firewall, but it's unclassified.
[00:41:28.394 --> 00:41:29.835]  They're supposed to be releasing this.
[00:41:30.515 --> 00:41:34.038]  A little bird just put it on Scripps, the big document site.
[00:41:36.598 --> 00:41:37.238]  So that's a trick.
[00:41:37.259 --> 00:41:39.600]  When something's supposed to be declassified, they'll still hide it.
[00:41:40.521 --> 00:41:58.454]  So now, for four or five days, they've had the different publications, Stars and Stripes, Military.com, and others going, we don't know if the document's real, but these conspiracy theorists claim that we want to take over Texas and Utah this summer and martial law.
[00:41:58.474 --> 00:42:00.196]  We're not going to have martial law this summer.
[00:42:01.176 --> 00:42:03.718]  You notice how they don't deny the operation, though, whatsoever?
[00:42:04.219 --> 00:42:06.160]  They just keep trying to, you know,
[00:42:07.088 --> 00:42:18.438]  Move the attention away from the fact that that's going on and just keep throwing out the conspiracy term and keep attacking us so it takes people's attention off of the fact that there is a mission going to happen, just like it says in the documents.
[00:42:19.229 --> 00:42:20.030]  They're not denying it.
[00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:26.816]  And then you got contacted by one of your friends that you served with saying, shut up, it's a PSYOP, get none of your business.
[00:42:26.836 --> 00:42:27.097]  Yeah.
[00:42:27.677 --> 00:42:33.303]  And that's the reason why it's getting this kind of coverage because there is underlined hidden messages in this document.
[00:42:33.603 --> 00:42:37.587]  The Pentagon keeps attacking us, coming after us, claiming that we said this is secret.
[00:42:38.027 --> 00:42:47.670]  So now we're going to take a look at Fox News and in their article it says Pentagon and local law enforcement are trying to knock down the rumors and let everyone know that the feds have no plan to take over Texas.
[00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:54.491]  Well last night on the Kelly file, Megan Kelly was talking to a reporter out of LA, Chase Gallagher.
[00:42:54.891 --> 00:42:57.912]  Well the military says it's just training soldiers for the realities of war.
[00:42:58.432 --> 00:43:01.613]  Critics say the army is preparing for modern-day martial law.
[00:43:02.193 --> 00:43:04.154]  Trace Gallagher live in our West Coast newsroom with the story.
[00:43:04.174 --> 00:43:04.414]  Trace?
[00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:07.233]  And they joke back and forth and banter.
[00:43:07.554 --> 00:43:15.806]  They would not once mention the fact that Alex Jones or myself or InfoWars broke this story, brought to the attention of the American people.
[00:43:16.067 --> 00:43:20.554]  All they did was just call us some conspiracy group out of Austin, Texas or something like that.
[00:43:20.854 --> 00:43:21.734]  This is out of control.
[00:43:21.774 --> 00:43:26.936]  They are blatantly lying, saying that we said it was a secret document when we never said that whatsoever.
[00:43:27.296 --> 00:43:38.019]  Well, that hostile characterization didn't sit well with a far-right radio host in Austin who told his listeners that he had access to the secret document that details a federal takeover in Texas.
[00:43:38.419 --> 00:43:52.729]  A libertarian website also picked up on the plan, and before you know it, rallies were being held against the event, but apparently the so-called secret document was published weeks ago in several local newspapers, letting the public know the training was in the works.
[00:43:52.809 --> 00:44:01.735]  Still, the Pentagon and local law enforcement are trying to knock down the rumors, trying to let everyone know that the feds have no plans to grab the Lone Star State.
[00:44:01.775 --> 00:44:05.538]  Apparently this kind of stuff just doesn't play very well in Texas.
[00:44:06.238 --> 00:44:08.459]  Now, there were a few, so link to our videos.
[00:44:08.719 --> 00:44:21.364]  Last night, Alex Jones actually did a video which outlines with proof what is happening, the plan to condition the American public into accepting this military presence on the streets.
[00:44:21.844 --> 00:44:25.906]  Now we're going to look at an article from the Dallas Morning News that says, the U.S.
[00:44:26.046 --> 00:44:33.069]  Army Special Operations Command has an upcoming training exercise so covert there was a press release about it two days ago.
[00:44:33.669 --> 00:44:36.851]  Well, first of all, this goes back to the whole thing saying that we said it was secret.
[00:44:37.131 --> 00:44:38.151]  We never said it was secret.
[00:44:38.351 --> 00:44:40.772]  We showed you the document where it says unclassified.
[00:44:41.153 --> 00:44:42.473]  This is where it actually gets interesting.
[00:44:42.493 --> 00:44:54.399]  Now it says, despite assurances that the training is to prepare troops for overseas missions, Army documents in the past have made clear that plans for martial law are in place for within the continental United States.
[00:44:54.659 --> 00:45:06.598]  Now a leaked 2012 US Army Military Police Training Manual entitled Civil Disturbance Operations describes how soldiers would be ordered to confiscate firearms and kill American dissidents.
[00:45:07.284 --> 00:45:15.275]  The manual also revealed that prisoners would be detained in temporary internment camps and re-educated to gain a new appreciation of U.S.
[00:45:15.355 --> 00:45:19.260]  policies in accordance with, now this is the key part, the U.S.
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:22.864]  Army FM Field Manual, in case you don't know what FM is.
[00:45:24.907 --> 00:45:25.628]  We're good to go.
[00:45:42.529 --> 00:45:50.218]  Now it goes on to say that Jane Helm has also drawn comparisons to a 2012 scenario outlined by retired Army Colonel Kevin Benson in which the U.S.
[00:45:50.238 --> 00:45:59.069]  military is used to crush an insurgent rebellion overseen by Tea Party militia members who are going to take over the city of Darlington in South Carolina.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:08.845]  The exercise is known as Jade Helm 15, and conspiracy theorists believe it is targeting the southwest region of the United States, particularly the state of Texas.
[00:46:09.045 --> 00:46:25.293]  The military is denying the conspiracy, and a spokesman for the military said, this exercise is routine training to maintain a high level of readiness for Army Special Operations forces, because they must be ready to support potential missions anywhere in the world at a moment's notice.
[00:46:25.833 --> 00:46:27.714]  Army Lieutenant Colonel Mark LaStoria
[00:46:28.766 --> 00:46:37.628]  A SOCOM spokesperson says the notion was proposed by a few individuals who are unfamiliar with how and why SOCOM conducts training.
[00:46:38.268 --> 00:46:40.069]  A few individuals who are unfamiliar.
[00:46:40.329 --> 00:46:43.309]  In case you forgot, I'm Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, U.S.
[00:46:43.389 --> 00:46:44.010]  Army, retired.
[00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:45.930]  I'm very familiar with these documents.
[00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:50.011]  The reason that we broke this is because I saw the underlying meaning behind it.
[00:46:50.251 --> 00:46:52.031]  So don't tell me or question my service.
[00:46:52.312 --> 00:46:58.073]  I didn't sit there and bleed for my country and watch my friends die so you can tell me that I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
[00:46:58.553 --> 00:47:11.082]  Now we're going to go on to the next article by the Houston Chronicle and it says, plans for a 17 city army special operations exercise in Texas stirred up some ultra right wing fears of a government takeover in the Lone Star State.
[00:47:11.422 --> 00:47:14.484]  But local law enforcement says they've been long aware of this drill.
[00:47:14.704 --> 00:47:18.246]  They've only been talking to people within Texas since the beginning of March.
[00:47:18.467 --> 00:47:22.850]  So I wouldn't say this is a long time known operation that you guys have had planned.
[00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:24.771]  So we'll go ahead and go past that.
[00:47:25.171 --> 00:47:33.493]  Now it says training exercise Jade Helm is going to assist our special operations soldiers in refining the skills needed against an ever-changing foreign threat.
[00:47:33.573 --> 00:47:44.976]  Well, I don't know if you guys remember when David Knight and I went to AP Hill in Virginia and showed you the training facility that has a church, a mosque, a soccer field, a subway station.
[00:47:45.216 --> 00:47:49.337]  Like we've always said, in the military you train how you fight and you train in an environment
[00:47:49.677 --> 00:47:53.320]  Similar to the theater of operations that you will go to in combat.
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:56.582]  So why are these places popping up all over our country?
[00:47:57.182 --> 00:47:57.823]  A foreign threat?
[00:47:57.843 --> 00:47:59.023]  It looks more domestic to me.
[00:47:59.043 --> 00:48:00.364]  Well guys, guess what?
[00:48:00.384 --> 00:48:01.305]  I accept your challenge.
[00:48:01.585 --> 00:48:06.488]  I'll be out there in some of those cities in Camo myself, trying to find you guys, call you out, call local law enforcement,
[00:48:19.797 --> 00:48:20.958]  Because I'm going to be a spotter.
[00:48:20.978 --> 00:48:22.659]  You guys remember when you went to sniper school?
[00:48:22.899 --> 00:48:25.760]  When the spotter sat up there and you guys shot targets and he tried to find you?
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:26.861]  That's what we're going to do.
[00:48:27.101 --> 00:48:33.044]  I'm also going to encourage a lot of my InfoWars listeners out there to go out to these different cities as well and see if you can spot these guys.
[00:48:33.264 --> 00:48:34.064]  And let's call in on them.
[00:48:34.084 --> 00:48:35.265]  Let's see how good these guys are.
[00:48:35.485 --> 00:48:46.290]  Because we don't need a whole bunch of special operations commandos running around dressed in civilian attire, operating civilian vehicles, and also a bunch of guys in ghillie suits moving around through the woods doing God knows what.
[00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:49.471]  So, so far I've covered all the mainstream media lies.
[00:48:49.572 --> 00:48:53.053]  Now what I want you to do, I want you to go to InfoWars.com.
[00:48:53.293 --> 00:49:06.440]  I want you to tell your friends to go there right now and go to the article, Beyond Denial, Preparations for Martial Law in America, where Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones lay out all the information over the past few years
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:11.444]  Where it clearly states the government is ramping up to do these type of missions.
[00:49:11.824 --> 00:49:20.072]  Now Jade Helm 1-5 is something that's probably been in the works for a long time because all this information that you can find in this article is very informative.
[00:49:20.112 --> 00:49:26.117]  It'll help give you a background about what this mission really is and what it is that the government's trying to do.
[00:49:26.437 --> 00:49:31.782]  Now finally, I want to call out all you Pentagon propaganda pushing MSM sites out there.
[00:49:32.122 --> 00:49:40.044]  The reason why you guys are afraid to ever link to our information and call us by name is because you know the American people will find out the truth.
[00:49:40.304 --> 00:49:44.025]  You guys are all working for the military-industrial complex.
[00:49:44.045 --> 00:49:49.307]  You guys are all vetted in the military, and you guys get paid by these guys to push their BS.
[00:49:49.747 --> 00:49:50.867]  I'm an American citizen.
[00:49:51.168 --> 00:49:51.728]  I'm a soldier.
[00:49:51.768 --> 00:49:56.769]  I'm pissed off, and after this video, a lot of American citizens are going to be pissed off, too.
[00:49:57.089 --> 00:49:59.510]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com signing off.
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:17.846]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:50:18.147 --> 00:50:20.208]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:50:20.369 --> 00:50:23.011]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:50:23.071 --> 00:50:27.174]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:50:27.494 --> 00:50:30.657]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:50:30.677 --> 00:50:37.943]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:50:38.123 --> 00:50:42.247]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:50:42.427 --> 00:50:44.088]  We are the true media.
[00:50:44.229 --> 00:50:46.851]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:50:46.951 --> 00:50:50.574]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.

[00:51:17.523 --> 00:51:19.445]  Dan Badandi for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:51:19.825 --> 00:51:20.626]  In this year's St.
[00:51:20.666 --> 00:51:26.611]  Patrick's Day Parade, people are all coming out to brave the cold and the snow just to support the Irish.
[00:51:27.051 --> 00:51:36.580]  But can these same people brave the government and their new control grid as they're pushing mandatory vaccines, driverless autonomous cars, and internet neutrality?
[00:51:41.681 --> 00:51:44.283]  Do you support the Republican or Democratic party or neither?
[00:51:44.623 --> 00:51:44.904]  Neither.
[00:51:45.724 --> 00:51:47.546]  Usually I end up supporting the Democrats.
[00:51:48.687 --> 00:51:49.888]  Neither at this point in my life.
[00:51:49.908 --> 00:51:50.849]  I'm a Democrat right now.
[00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.629]  Neither.
[00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:53.030]  I'm more Republican.
[00:51:53.751 --> 00:51:54.872]  I'm actually independent.
[00:51:55.493 --> 00:51:55.753]  Democrat.
[00:51:55.773 --> 00:51:56.153]  Democrat.
[00:51:56.894 --> 00:51:57.434]  Republican.
[00:51:59.576 --> 00:52:01.377]  I like to think I support the Republican also.
[00:52:01.638 --> 00:52:03.019]  I tend to lean more Democrat.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.001]  In 2016, the presidential elections, who would you vote for?
[00:52:06.041 --> 00:52:07.823]  Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush or somebody else?
[00:52:09.339 --> 00:52:12.600]  Uh, I'd probably vote for... Somebody else.
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:18.322]  Well, I really just wish that I was old enough to run for president, but I'm not.
[00:52:18.822 --> 00:52:19.422]  Hillary Clinton.
[00:52:19.882 --> 00:52:20.762]  I'd say Clinton as well.
[00:52:21.683 --> 00:52:22.283]  Somebody else.
[00:52:23.523 --> 00:52:24.223]  I don't know, actually.
[00:52:25.244 --> 00:52:26.284]  I would vote for Hillary Clinton.
[00:52:27.184 --> 00:52:27.865]  Hillary Clinton.
[00:52:28.405 --> 00:52:29.085]  Yeah, I heard so.
[00:52:29.205 --> 00:52:29.865]  Hillary Clinton.
[00:52:31.686 --> 00:52:32.206]  Oh, Jeb Bush.
[00:52:34.006 --> 00:52:35.747]  Still, jury's still out, but not Clinton.
[00:52:36.728 --> 00:52:41.530]  Uh, I think I'd rather get all the options first, but as it goes right now, I'd probably go for Hillary.
[00:52:48.173 --> 00:52:51.054]  As of late, the FCC has now taken full control of the internet.
[00:52:51.094 --> 00:52:55.716]  Do you think this is just another way for the federal government to control and spy on us, or is it for our safety?
[00:52:56.516 --> 00:52:58.397]  I think it's more of like a Big Brother kind of thing.
[00:52:59.269 --> 00:53:03.693]  I think that net neutrality is extremely important, and it's something that's absolutely necessary.
[00:53:04.733 --> 00:53:08.456]  I don't think that there's spying going on with net neutrality.
[00:53:08.477 --> 00:53:09.978]  I feel like they're spying on us.
[00:53:10.658 --> 00:53:11.899]  They're spying on us, definitely.
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:13.040]  Absolutely.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:14.141]  I don't support that one bit.
[00:53:14.161 --> 00:53:17.224]  They're just trying to do things to protect us, that's all.
[00:53:18.024 --> 00:53:18.805]  Hands down, safety.
[00:53:19.726 --> 00:53:20.847]  I'd like to think it's safety also.
[00:53:21.587 --> 00:53:23.148]  I think it's overall for our safety.
[00:53:23.429 --> 00:53:26.191]  However, I do believe that it may lead to some corruption.
[00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:27.010]  I don't know.
[00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:29.212]  In my opinion, I think the inter should be off limits.
[00:53:29.852 --> 00:53:31.553]  13th Continental Reservate!
[00:53:31.914 --> 00:53:33.315]  InfoWars.com!
[00:53:41.881 --> 00:53:45.063]  And driverless autonomous cars are now being pushed in the UK.
[00:53:45.123 --> 00:53:48.425]  Are you aware that the United States is trying to push these cars within the next couple of years?
[00:53:48.786 --> 00:53:50.627]  And would you feel safe with these vehicles on the road?
[00:53:50.867 --> 00:53:51.387]  Not at all.
[00:53:51.988 --> 00:53:53.269]  I would not feel safe at all.
[00:53:54.116 --> 00:54:08.272]  I'd feel safe as long as I do the research to make sure that the cars are safe and that there's peer-reviewed journal articles showing their safety and that all of that has been regulated and shown to be safe, then I'd be perfectly fine with it.
[00:54:08.777 --> 00:54:12.762]  I'd give it a couple more years before I feel entirely safe because it's new technology and stuff like that.
[00:54:13.003 --> 00:54:17.649]  This is my first time hearing about it, but right now I don't think it'll be right, but in a few years it'll be a good thing to do.
[00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:24.899]  I would not feel safe only because if they're operated by GPS, they're not going to be able to see pedestrians.
[00:54:25.319 --> 00:54:26.100]  No, I would not.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:26.760]  No, no.
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.302]  Because there's too many gas operator cars.
[00:54:29.802 --> 00:54:31.303]  And they probably don't have control over them.
[00:54:31.363 --> 00:54:35.746]  And these gas powered cars, if they're going slow, they're going to push them up the road.
[00:54:36.546 --> 00:54:40.229]  I think it would take some time before I feel safe letting someone else have control.
[00:54:40.774 --> 00:54:49.318]  If they're 100% tested before they get on the road, I would feel safe, but it would definitely have to go through a lot of testing before I would want to see one of those out there.
[00:54:49.618 --> 00:54:49.918]  I don't.
[00:54:50.098 --> 00:54:50.998]  I don't feel safe with it.
[00:54:51.299 --> 00:55:01.663]  I believe the owner, the operator should be fully responsible for whatever action is taken on the road and, you know, being controlled by a robot is something that we should never see in our lifetime.
[00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:10.252]  Do you believe vaccines are safe or not?
[00:55:10.292 --> 00:55:10.692]  Your thoughts?
[00:55:11.413 --> 00:55:13.035]  Yes, I believe they work in most cases.
[00:55:13.596 --> 00:55:14.937]  Yes, I believe the same thing.
[00:55:15.498 --> 00:55:16.599]  I believe vaccines are safe.
[00:55:16.799 --> 00:55:18.501]  I believe that all children should be vaccinated.
[00:55:19.562 --> 00:55:20.103]  Vaccines?
[00:55:20.563 --> 00:55:21.064]  I think so.
[00:55:21.344 --> 00:55:24.848]  I mean, as long as they're handled carefully, I don't see why not.
[00:55:25.469 --> 00:55:26.110]  Yes, they are.
[00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:27.391]  Yes, yes, I do.
[00:55:27.431 --> 00:55:29.754]  All my children have vaccine, have been vaccinated.
[00:55:30.532 --> 00:55:36.256]  I think vaccines now are a lot different than when I was young, and they definitely need to be closely monitored.
[00:55:37.697 --> 00:55:39.758]  I believe vaccines are pretty safe, you know.
[00:55:40.159 --> 00:55:42.220]  They've been working for however long, so.
[00:55:44.582 --> 00:55:49.105]  Well, I like to think that I follow my doctor's prescriptions and what they recommend.
[00:55:49.605 --> 00:55:53.768]  So if they recommend a vaccine, usually I move forward with it after some investigation.
[00:55:55.429 --> 00:55:55.629]  Some.
[00:55:55.649 --> 00:55:55.669]  50-50.
[00:55:56.972 --> 00:56:01.416]  There's microchips and all this other stuff going on, and I don't agree with it at all.
[00:56:01.776 --> 00:56:02.197]  Not at all.
[00:56:02.737 --> 00:56:04.879]  Vaccines are absolutely, positively safe.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.501]  You should get your child vaccinated.
[00:56:06.801 --> 00:56:07.402]  The end.
[00:56:08.423 --> 00:56:13.587]  Just three days after receiving a flu shot, Mary Sue was paralyzed, diagnosed with a rare disease.
[00:56:14.228 --> 00:56:15.169]  So what happened?
[00:56:15.908 --> 00:56:16.888]  I can't even read.
[00:56:16.908 --> 00:56:19.069]  I used to love to read.
[00:56:19.089 --> 00:56:21.990]  I loved to sew and crochet.
[00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:23.530]  I can't do that now.
[00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:25.891]  That flu shot did me in.
[00:56:26.491 --> 00:56:28.351]  Flu viruses, they're always changing.
[00:56:28.391 --> 00:56:31.472]  And this year, H3N2, that bug changed so much.
[00:56:31.532 --> 00:56:35.313]  Researchers have found the vaccine in Canada just isn't working at all.
[00:56:35.493 --> 00:56:43.355]  And in fact, if you received a flu shot last year as well, it could actually increase your risk of becoming ill.
[00:56:43.835 --> 00:56:45.616]  Remember the swine flu scare of 1976?
[00:56:45.876 --> 00:56:48.118]  That was the year the U.S.
[00:56:48.158 --> 00:56:53.120]  government told us all that swine flu could turn out to be a killer that could spread across the nation.
[00:56:53.681 --> 00:57:00.725]  And Washington decided that every man, woman, and child in the nation should get a shot to prevent a nationwide outbreak, a pandemic.
[00:57:01.949 --> 00:57:04.431]  Well, 46 million of us obediently took the shot.
[00:57:05.231 --> 00:57:13.716]  And now 4,000 Americans are claiming damages from Uncle Sam amounting to three and a half billion dollars because of what happened when they took that shot.
[00:57:14.717 --> 00:57:22.062]  In the latest controversial question, do you think vaccinations should be made mandatory given a parent no control or choice of their children being vaccinated?
[00:57:22.542 --> 00:57:23.382]  Absolutely not.
[00:57:23.923 --> 00:57:24.303]  No way.
[00:57:25.123 --> 00:57:27.345]  I believe that parents should have the choice.
[00:57:27.605 --> 00:57:30.727]  However, I believe that the parents should be smart about their decision.
[00:57:31.178 --> 00:57:36.179]  They shouldn't have a choice because vaccines are better for their children.
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:37.060]  Yep.
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:38.740]  I used to work at a hospital and I know.
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:41.641]  I feel like it's all up to the parent.
[00:57:41.681 --> 00:57:45.282]  If the parent wants their children to use that, they should.
[00:57:45.982 --> 00:57:46.862]  Yeah, same thing.
[00:57:46.882 --> 00:57:48.663]  I believe it's up to the parent what they want to do with their kids.
[00:57:48.683 --> 00:57:49.483]  It shouldn't be the government.
[00:57:50.623 --> 00:57:53.964]  I believe the parent should always be notified because it's your kid, you know?
[00:57:54.104 --> 00:57:54.604]  It's your blood.
[00:57:55.125 --> 00:57:57.725]  But mandatory, yeah, I believe so.
[00:57:58.285 --> 00:57:58.465]  No.
[00:57:58.685 --> 00:57:58.846]  No.
[00:57:59.546 --> 00:57:59.666]  No.
[00:57:59.966 --> 00:58:00.286]  Absolutely not.
[00:58:00.762 --> 00:58:05.284]  Well, I do agree that they are important, but I think it's completely up to the parent.
[00:58:05.724 --> 00:58:09.366]  People have their own free will, and I strictly, I firmly believe in that.
[00:58:12.668 --> 00:58:22.092]  In the case of vaccines, they're safe, and I don't think that parents should be able to choose whether or not vaccines are right for their child, because they are right for their child.
[00:58:22.112 --> 00:58:27.135]  Okay, and the flu shots, are you aware that they contain dimerosol formaldehyde?
[00:58:27.728 --> 00:58:28.128]  Yes, I am.
[00:58:28.148 --> 00:58:33.092]  Okay, and are you aware that formaldehyde is over the safe amount for the human consumption?
[00:58:33.872 --> 00:58:34.293]  Yes, I am.
[00:58:34.493 --> 00:58:35.433]  I still got a flu shot.
[00:58:36.834 --> 00:58:41.338]  I think the bottom line is our daughter was born normal.
[00:58:41.438 --> 00:58:44.340]  She developed normally for the first 18 months of life.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:47.642]  There were no signs of any underlying genetic disorder.
[00:58:48.042 --> 00:58:49.223]  Then she was vaccinated.
[00:58:49.303 --> 00:58:50.264]  She became ill.
[00:58:50.724 --> 00:58:54.487]  That illness eventually led to a diagnosis of autism, then later seizures.
[00:58:54.787 --> 00:58:56.048]  My name is Sue Latour.
[00:58:56.108 --> 00:58:57.368]  This is my daughter, Kimberly.
[00:58:57.708 --> 00:59:00.890]  Kimberly is a vaccine injury child.
[00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:05.131]  She was nine weeks old when she had her initial shot.
[00:59:05.471 --> 00:59:06.392]  How do you convince me?
[00:59:06.452 --> 00:59:08.813]  How do you convince the other parents out there that we need to do this?
[00:59:08.833 --> 00:59:11.154]  Careful, I'm going to get it, if that helps at all.
[00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:12.934]  But I'll tell you, my wife is not going to immunize our kids.
[00:59:13.215 --> 00:59:16.136]  Because I've got four of them, and when I go home, I'm not Dr. Oz, I'm Mr. Oz.
[00:59:21.158 --> 00:59:31.468]  With the federal government bearing down control on our technology, our transportation, and our health, perhaps we may need a little luck of the Irish in the fighting spirit to take back our civil liberties.
[00:59:31.648 --> 00:59:34.551]  And this is Dan Badandi for the InfoWars Nightly News.
