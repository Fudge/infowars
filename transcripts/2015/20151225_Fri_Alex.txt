[00:00:18.792 --> 00:00:20.914]  Waging War on Corruption.
[00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:26.579]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:29.702]  I want you.
[00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:30.583]  I need you.
[00:00:32.624 --> 00:00:33.545]  I want you.
[00:00:34.406 --> 00:00:35.227]  I need you.
[00:00:35.287 --> 00:00:38.049]  I want you to be mine tonight.
[00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.712]  You need me.
[00:00:41.392 --> 00:00:42.493]  You tease me.
[00:00:42.513 --> 00:00:43.274]  Ignore us.
[00:00:43.294 --> 00:00:45.316]  The accomplished director, actor,
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.666]  The progeny of the great and mighty King Norris will be joining us in studio.
[00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:54.676]  I'm a little bit wound up.
[00:00:55.356 --> 00:00:58.478]  Okay, only one cup of coffee so far today, but I am wound up right now.
[00:00:58.498 --> 00:01:00.259]  I am wound up.
[00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.679]  I am angry.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.780]  I just, I get upset.
[00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.142]  But at the same time, I get happy when I'm fighting tyranny.
[00:01:06.162 --> 00:01:07.703]  So thank you for putting up with me.
[00:01:07.723 --> 00:01:13.026]  I'm going to control myself now or I'll be totally exhausted by this evening if I continue to bounce all over the walls here, but that's what's happening.
[00:01:13.946 --> 00:01:19.249]  Dems propose civil rights-free legals, ISIS to enter the U.S., Kit Daniels, Infowars.com.
[00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.833]  Senator Sessions has released the plan that they're planning to put through Congress.
[00:01:25.334 --> 00:01:28.896]  Any alien denied entry could file suit to demand entry and claims damages.
[00:01:29.397 --> 00:01:30.678]  That's for the lawyers to make money too.
[00:01:30.978 --> 00:01:33.920]  For lost employment, lost welfare benefits, lost income.
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.541]  And they want to let ISIS in.
[00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:38.503]  We'll break this down coming up later in the hour.
[00:01:38.543 --> 00:01:41.826]  But Alex Newman, again you have the fortune or misfortune of
[00:01:42.446 --> 00:01:45.890]  Joining me today in the last hour when I was in particular Piranha Mode.
[00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:48.352]  You're right though, this is the battle.
[00:01:48.552 --> 00:01:49.774]  The enemy's inside the gates.
[00:01:50.895 --> 00:01:52.577]  It's actually the animating contest of liberty.
[00:01:52.677 --> 00:01:59.364]  What can we do to expose the fact that the entire West is being usurped into an anti-human eugenics world government as we speak?
[00:02:00.726 --> 00:02:05.088]  I think one of the best things that people can do is, first of all, educate themselves and then spread the word.
[00:02:05.128 --> 00:02:13.511]  You know, share Alex Jones' program through your Twitter, through your Facebook with your friends, share the New Americans articles, get the information out there so that people realize.
[00:02:13.551 --> 00:02:24.035]  Because what I've found, and we've interviewed a number of people who used to be global warming alarmists, we interviewed an engineer who quit his job to get involved in stopping global warming until he realized it was all a fraud.
[00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:25.896]  So, the facts are compelling.
[00:02:25.936 --> 00:02:27.016]  The truth stands on its own.
[00:02:27.337 --> 00:02:29.918]  Yes, the globalists have billions, trillions of dollars.
[00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.959]  Yes, they had control of all the big media.
[00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.260]  And, you know, they're the rock stars here.
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.322]  But, you know, the truth stands on its own.
[00:02:37.362 --> 00:02:38.803]  We don't need the billions of dollars.
[00:02:38.863 --> 00:02:39.983]  We need the facts.
[00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:40.884]  We need the truth.
[00:02:41.144 --> 00:02:44.426]  And with those two weapons, we can stop this scam.
[00:02:44.526 --> 00:02:48.888]  And once the American people are sufficiently educated, we can work with our elected officials.
[00:02:49.148 --> 00:02:51.409]  And, you know, Congress could very easily stop this.
[00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:52.650]  Every Republican in Congress
[00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.112]  Uh, ran on a platform of stopping Obama.
[00:02:55.412 --> 00:02:57.273]  Now you have an opportunity to stop Obama.
[00:02:57.533 --> 00:03:02.497]  When you pass the budget, say, not one penny of this budget is going to climate negotiations.
[00:03:02.617 --> 00:03:08.461]  Not one penny of this budget is going to the cap-and-trade that you couldn't even get through the Democrat-controlled Congress.
[00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:11.222]  Not one penny of this money is going for the gun grab.
[00:03:11.242 --> 00:03:13.684]  Not one penny of this money is going for any of Obama's agenda.
[00:03:13.884 --> 00:03:17.787]  So Republicans who say, oh, we can't do anything, we need to win the White House, they're not telling the truth.
[00:03:18.067 --> 00:03:18.728]  Don't squeeze, only tickle!
[00:03:47.617 --> 00:03:47.797]  Right.
[00:03:48.177 --> 00:03:49.559]  There goes Schwarzenegger again, right?
[00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:51.780]  And there's a whole bunch of nutty American officials here.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.925]  You have the EPA chief here, who's the one in charge of implementing all of Obama's... Well, I mean, I didn't want to go off on Schwarzenegger.
[00:03:57.965 --> 00:04:07.532]  I mean, I love some of his earlier movies, like Running Man and Predator, and Conan the Barbarian is just amazingly... not Conan the Destroyer, that's comedy, but Conan the Barbarian is amazing.
[00:04:08.112 --> 00:04:12.655]  I like Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, quite frankly, but as a person, he's an oppressive evil.
[00:04:13.216 --> 00:04:15.257]  He makes Lance Armstrong look like a humanitarian.
[00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:18.519]  I mean, the stuff he's been involved in, the arrogance, I hate him!
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:24.643]  He's just the antithesis of Americana, and I literally just want him out of my life.
[00:04:24.744 --> 00:04:32.229]  I mean, he literally is perching on me with munialization, trying to take over all the major cities and put us under carbon tax one way or the other.
[00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:35.431]  I mean, I'm sure, as you know, Alex, he quarterbacks that whole operation.
[00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:40.722]  Yep, and you know, he's a good representative for the type of people who are here at this UN Summit.
[00:04:41.042 --> 00:04:53.146]  They're, you know, at least at the upper levels, they're all totalitarian, they're all incredible hypocrites, and they all want to, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, you know, control your life, and so people need to understand... He says he admires Hitler!
[00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:55.386]  Listen, Alex, thank you so much, great job.
[00:04:55.646 --> 00:05:01.548]  Folks can read your report without all my screaming, but we need some screaming too, at the New American Magazine, newamerican.com.
[00:05:01.788 --> 00:05:04.969]  Thank you so much, brother, we'll be talking to you again soon, after you get back from Paris.
[00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:06.579]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:07.619]  Mike Norris is coming up.
[00:05:24.704 --> 00:05:25.124]  And the U.S.
[00:05:25.144 --> 00:05:34.547]  government has even hired a data security firm to create large numbers of fake social media profiles that could be used to spread propaganda, while also encountering anti-establishment viewpoints online.
[00:05:34.727 --> 00:05:42.650]  Also, an increasing number of mainstream news outlets are disabling or severely restricting comment sections to silence out critics that challenge the prevailing status quo pushed by the media.
[00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.975]  For example, Popular Science said it was killing its comics section to silence global warming skeptics.
[00:05:48.255 --> 00:05:52.339]  In other words, they don't want readers to have the ability to sway public opinion against their agenda.
[00:05:52.459 --> 00:06:00.247]  The ultimate endgame is to both eradicate free speech on the internet and to turn the internet into a tightly controlled medium where only government-approved viewpoints are allowed.
[00:06:00.427 --> 00:06:04.371]  In other words, governments want to bury the truth found on the internet in favor of government lies.
[00:06:04.571 --> 00:06:07.393]  You can find out more about the war on the internet at InfoWars.com.

[00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:12.696]  Soon Christmas would have come and gone, and with it, 2015.

[00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:25.772]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:34.232 --> 00:08:35.713]  You want some rock and roll intro, buddy?
[00:08:35.733 --> 00:08:36.214]  You got it.
[00:08:36.314 --> 00:08:37.915]  Deep Purple, Smoke on the Water.
[00:08:38.996 --> 00:08:42.659]  Some amazing guitar coming up here in just a moment.
[00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:43.039]  Right here.
[00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:46.622]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:08:46.662 --> 00:08:47.582]  to 3 p.m.
[00:08:47.602 --> 00:08:48.003]  Central.
[00:08:48.543 --> 00:08:49.584]  We're here live.
[00:08:50.164 --> 00:08:50.725]  Mike Norris.
[00:08:51.806 --> 00:08:52.826]  Accomplished filmmaker.
[00:08:53.627 --> 00:08:54.728]  Here it is.
[00:08:55.028 --> 00:08:55.548]  Coming up.
[00:08:56.129 --> 00:08:58.491]  Documentary filmmaker, TV maker, actor.
[00:09:01.478 --> 00:09:03.658]  And of course, the firstborn son of Chuck Norris.
[00:09:04.098 --> 00:09:05.619]  It doesn't get any better than that.
[00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:06.959]  And we are very flattered.
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.500]  Chuck Norris, of course, has been on the show a few times.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.320]  I know he is a listener.
[00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:15.423]  And of course, nice photo you sent us of you down there at the ranch with him with the InfoWars.com shirt.
[00:09:15.663 --> 00:09:24.426]  Before we get into Amerageddon premiere, this trailer, talk about all the censorship and things that it has basically gone through.
[00:09:25.894 --> 00:09:31.118]  What about the idea of drafting Chuck Norris 2016?
[00:09:31.218 --> 00:09:39.264]  I think he would be even way more invincible and measured in what he said than somebody like even Donald Trump.
[00:09:39.284 --> 00:09:42.126]  And I like Donald Trump, he's been on, he obviously is the big Republican leader.
[00:09:42.186 --> 00:09:46.469]  Or what about a Chuck Norris, Donald Trump, take a minute, I know your dad is known for being
[00:09:47.289 --> 00:09:48.590]  Super incredibly humble.
[00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.930]  Never have seen him at Republican events over time.
[00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:52.651]  He doesn't like people really complimenting him.
[00:09:52.971 --> 00:10:00.574]  But I mean, come on, we need somebody who's been a filmmaker, an entrepreneur, you know, world champion, you know, in karate, in his own right.
[00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:06.641]  From Texas or from Oklahoma, you know, who's been in the military the whole nine yards, versus these lawyers.
[00:10:06.701 --> 00:10:08.321]  And Ted Cruz is a lawyer, I like him.
[00:10:08.722 --> 00:10:11.002]  But I like Rand Paul because he's an optometrist or whatever.
[00:10:11.983 --> 00:10:13.323]  Trump, he's a self-made billionaire.
[00:10:13.763 --> 00:10:18.505]  I really am just sick of these inside-the-beltway people that are smoking their own dope.
[00:10:18.565 --> 00:10:22.306]  But Mike Norris, before we get into Amerigeddon, all things Chuck Norris.
[00:10:22.326 --> 00:10:30.029]  You always show me some cool stuff behind-the-scenes baseball, and we're going to work to get your dad on soon, but he's really kind of been chilling out, writing for WorldNet daily, and he deserves that.
[00:10:30.869 --> 00:10:33.771]  But, wow, I mean, America needs Chuck Norris.
[00:10:34.752 --> 00:10:35.653]  How great would that be?
[00:10:36.273 --> 00:10:38.835]  To have my dad as the President of the United States.
[00:10:38.895 --> 00:10:45.120]  I mean, it's been great to kind of witness his evolution into the film industry.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.082]  But, wow, President would be great.
[00:10:48.242 --> 00:10:48.563]  I'm in.
[00:10:48.623 --> 00:10:50.204]  I'd love to go to the White House to see him there.
[00:10:50.464 --> 00:10:53.086]  How long was he the top grossing action figure ever?
[00:10:53.106 --> 00:10:55.648]  I mean, wasn't it like a decade he was the top grossing of all time?
[00:10:55.769 --> 00:11:01.053]  Yeah, every four months he'd have a new film come out, number one in the box office, and it was great.
[00:11:01.073 --> 00:11:08.179]  That was, you know, the 80s and 90s, and then he started on Walker, Texas Ranger, and that just kind of took it to a whole nother level.
[00:11:08.539 --> 00:11:11.081]  You know, they can say they're going to have Chimera clones now.
[00:11:11.142 --> 00:11:18.588]  We could dig up John Wayne, and then your dad could donate some stem cells, and we could create a John Wayne Chuck Norris creature.
[00:11:20.239 --> 00:11:20.599]  I'm in.
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.641]  Let's throw a little Alex Jones in there, too.
[00:11:22.821 --> 00:11:24.363]  No, no, no.
[00:11:24.383 --> 00:11:27.065]  We'll throw Donald Trump's hair in, genetically.
[00:11:27.085 --> 00:11:28.526]  The creature will have Donald Trump's hair.
[00:11:29.467 --> 00:11:30.188]  I like his hair.
[00:11:30.688 --> 00:11:31.329]  What's wrong with it?
[00:11:31.469 --> 00:11:31.829]  I hear you.
[00:11:31.849 --> 00:11:34.752]  We'll mix in some Elvis.
[00:11:36.033 --> 00:11:37.895]  We'll dig up George Washington, mix in some of that.
[00:11:38.395 --> 00:11:39.316]  Little Ronald Reagan?
[00:11:39.596 --> 00:11:39.857]  Sure.
[00:11:40.657 --> 00:11:42.239]  We won't be mixing any Schwarzenegger in.
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:43.580]  Or Clinton.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.662]  Or Clinton.
[00:11:45.702 --> 00:11:46.743]  Hillary, though, so beautiful.
[00:11:48.604 --> 00:11:50.929]  Sorry, just spit up a little bit.
[00:11:51.229 --> 00:11:52.852]  But no, I mean, could your dad be convinced?
[00:11:52.873 --> 00:11:54.135]  I mean, I know people brought it up to him.
[00:11:54.656 --> 00:11:55.798]  What would his reservations be?
[00:11:55.858 --> 00:11:57.361]  I mean, if any, to running for president.
[00:11:58.186 --> 00:12:02.507]  You know, I think the idea of it is really cool.
[00:12:02.907 --> 00:12:08.009]  But, you know, he's so much into his foundation, his Kickstart Foundation.
[00:12:08.109 --> 00:12:09.109]  Helping kids.
[00:12:09.149 --> 00:12:10.049]  Helping kids.
[00:12:10.849 --> 00:12:13.430]  He's starting a new water company, Seaforce Water.
[00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.411]  So he's busy right now.
[00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:18.331]  But he's very in tune with what's happening in the world.
[00:12:18.711 --> 00:12:21.492]  He's very in tune with the media.
[00:12:21.852 --> 00:12:25.953]  Knowing full well the media, the mainstream media, is a lie.
[00:12:26.374 --> 00:12:27.194]  And I think that's
[00:12:28.214 --> 00:12:32.056]  That's important because we need people like you and my father to let people know.
[00:12:33.216 --> 00:12:35.197]  Fox, CNN, ABC, NBC.
[00:12:35.998 --> 00:12:36.698]  It's all a lie.
[00:12:37.038 --> 00:12:39.659]  And if you really want to get news, where do we go?
[00:12:39.739 --> 00:12:40.500]  We go to Alex.
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.280]  We go to Drudge.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.321]  We go to Breitbart.
[00:12:42.601 --> 00:12:44.622]  That's where we got to go now to get our information.
[00:12:45.142 --> 00:12:55.247]  So... Is it surprising to you that it came out, FBI agents and others have said they were blocked from investigating this couple and that mosque, and actually had the Civil Rights Commission from the White House sent down to stop them?
[00:12:56.908 --> 00:12:57.489]  Ridiculous.
[00:12:57.649 --> 00:13:01.172]  And then now it came out confirmed that the White House ordered the FBI to say this wasn't terrorism.
[00:13:02.093 --> 00:13:05.317]  Yeah, I watched it kind of unfold.
[00:13:06.438 --> 00:13:14.987]  Interestingly enough, the day Donald was on your show, I'm fixated on watching Donald Trump on your show, and then two hours later this thing happens.
[00:13:15.667 --> 00:13:18.130]  I'm watching it unfold and slowly but surely
[00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:30.196]  I'd watch Fox, I'd watch CNN, but everything from Fox, they'd say his name was a Muslim name, and then two hours later, CNN would have to, ugh, they were Muslims.
[00:13:31.097 --> 00:13:31.677]  It was pathetic.
[00:13:31.697 --> 00:13:32.678]  But it wasn't terror.
[00:13:32.938 --> 00:13:34.979]  No, no, gosh no, it wasn't terror.
[00:13:35.039 --> 00:13:35.499]  Not at all.
[00:13:35.999 --> 00:13:41.382]  I mean, vest, bombs, going to Pakistan, and it turns out the government knew, ordered the FBI to stand down.
[00:13:41.462 --> 00:13:47.666]  That's, to me, how about them letting the media in the apartment two days later?
[00:13:48.246 --> 00:13:49.307]  Cameras inside the apartment?
[00:13:49.327 --> 00:13:50.007]  That's a crime scene!
[00:13:50.027 --> 00:13:51.287]  The bed hadn't even been turned.
[00:13:51.367 --> 00:13:51.508]  No.
[00:13:51.848 --> 00:13:53.008]  The walls hadn't been torn out.
[00:13:53.308 --> 00:13:58.050]  Normally, in a real attack like this, if they didn't want to get rid of the crime scene, they would... It'd be closed for months!
[00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.371]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:13:59.531 --> 00:13:59.991]  Absolutely.
[00:14:00.271 --> 00:14:02.252]  And that's why I need Gary here for this.
[00:14:02.392 --> 00:14:05.114]  I mean, this... Let's talk about... Let's talk about the guy that... Absolutely.
[00:14:05.134 --> 00:14:06.094]  Let's get into the film.
[00:14:06.474 --> 00:14:07.715]  Let's talk about Amara Gedden.
[00:14:07.735 --> 00:14:10.716]  We're going to be playing the trailer coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:14:10.936 --> 00:14:12.737]  The trailer's now on InfoWars.com.
[00:14:13.617 --> 00:14:16.719]  And let's talk about people like Gary taking action to make this film.
[00:14:17.196 --> 00:14:22.380]  You know, Gary and Diane Haven, to me, are amazing people.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:40.753]  Here's a guy that has created a successful company, a successful business, has all the money in the world, could do whatever he wants, and what he has decided to do is he's going to stand up, he's going to put his money up, and he's going to create content, create films that is to expose the elites of the world.
[00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:41.834]  This is just the beginning.
[00:14:41.914 --> 00:14:42.895]  You're ready to announce this?
[00:14:43.515 --> 00:14:43.956]  This is it.
[00:14:44.716 --> 00:14:46.217]  All right, well go ahead and tell folks about it.
[00:14:46.577 --> 00:14:54.539]  We're launching the Facebook for the first time, the website, the trailer, amerageddonthemovie.com, links to infowars.com, Facebook, Twitter.
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.760]  Will this film save the world by itself?
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.060]  No.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.521]  Will this show do it by itself?
[00:14:58.601 --> 00:14:58.741]  No.
[00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:00.221]  Will Mike Norris by himself?
[00:15:00.281 --> 00:15:00.402]  No.
[00:15:00.462 --> 00:15:02.102]  Or Chuck Norris at WorldNetDaily?
[00:15:02.162 --> 00:15:02.302]  No.
[00:15:02.622 --> 00:15:09.605]  But all of us together, standing up to the New World Order, standing up to what's happening, the truth will expose what they're doing.
[00:15:09.625 --> 00:15:12.626]  And so it's very important that you make this film a hit.
[00:15:13.484 --> 00:15:15.205]  It's very entertaining, but very informative.
[00:15:15.546 --> 00:15:17.587]  It's very important that when it comes out in theaters, you see it.
[00:15:17.828 --> 00:15:19.189]  When it's on demand, you watch it.
[00:15:20.009 --> 00:15:22.411]  That when it then hits DVD, Blu-ray, you get it.
[00:15:22.772 --> 00:15:28.997]  Because we're building on alternative media, and when you come, that's actually what helps us build it bigger.
[00:15:29.037 --> 00:15:30.999]  It's kind of like Phil the Dream's, build it, they will come.
[00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:32.640]  Build something, they will come.
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.742]  But then we, you start supporting, it gets bigger and bigger.
[00:15:35.963 --> 00:15:37.704]  And that's what the system is afraid of.
[00:15:37.944 --> 00:15:39.846]  We got those documents from the Clinton Foundation.
[00:15:40.166 --> 00:15:42.527]  Twenty years ago, saying we've got to shut down this internet.
[00:15:42.827 --> 00:15:46.167]  What happens if Christians and Libertarians and Conservatives use it?
[00:15:46.467 --> 00:15:47.628]  That'll be it for us.
[00:15:47.928 --> 00:15:53.129]  So the talking point was, call them conspiracy theorists, call them racists, stick the IRS on them.
[00:15:53.429 --> 00:15:55.309]  And twenty years later, what do we see them doing?
[00:15:55.869 --> 00:15:56.529]  Exactly that.
[00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:57.570]  Exactly that.
[00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.750]  Getting back to the film, your dad warned you too, didn't he?
[00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:01.491]  Yeah, he did.
[00:16:01.751 --> 00:16:04.551]  And he warned me again after he saw the film.
[00:16:05.071 --> 00:16:08.232]  He goes, just so you know, you are now on the list.
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:10.460]  What list?
[00:16:11.901 --> 00:16:12.541]  The hit list.
[00:16:13.501 --> 00:16:14.301]  And you know what?
[00:16:14.481 --> 00:16:16.182]  I wear that badge with honor.
[00:16:16.982 --> 00:16:19.963]  Because if I'm doing something... And he was saying that in a good way to you.
[00:16:20.343 --> 00:16:20.944]  In a good way.
[00:16:21.684 --> 00:16:24.885]  Hey, I don't want to die for this movie.
[00:16:25.585 --> 00:16:26.525]  And I'm not putting words in your mouth.
[00:16:26.545 --> 00:16:27.966]  He told me at the time he said he was proud of you.
[00:16:28.606 --> 00:16:29.166]  Absolutely.
[00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:29.866]  Absolutely.
[00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:31.147]  He loved the movie.
[00:16:31.247 --> 00:16:32.727]  We have his full support on the film.
[00:16:35.458 --> 00:16:36.879]  That's a huge blessing to us.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.881]  But today is a big day.
[00:16:40.001 --> 00:16:42.723]  I mean, this is a movie we've been working on for a year and a half.
[00:16:43.724 --> 00:16:50.869]  It's a concept of Gary Havens, who I wish he could be here right now, but he is taking care of business somewhere in the world.
[00:16:51.469 --> 00:16:51.869]  I don't know.
[00:16:52.009 --> 00:16:53.771]  I'll find out next week when I see him.
[00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:56.152]  But this was his brainchild.
[00:16:56.172 --> 00:16:57.733]  He's like a James Bond character himself.
[00:16:57.813 --> 00:16:58.734]  He really is.
[00:16:58.954 --> 00:17:00.756]  He is so fascinating.
[00:17:01.676 --> 00:17:06.880]  So knowledgeable, and I, you know, it's kind of like talking to you, you just kind of get sucked in.
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.301]  Oh, you're too nice.
[00:17:08.341 --> 00:17:09.342]  He's more interesting than I am.
[00:17:10.283 --> 00:17:12.544]  And he's so knowledgeable, and he's so passionate.
[00:17:12.785 --> 00:17:16.387]  And like I said, here's a guy that could have done whatever he wants.
[00:17:16.607 --> 00:17:17.488]  He could go to his island.
[00:17:17.528 --> 00:17:18.149]  He could go to us.
[00:17:18.489 --> 00:17:20.390]  He's got property everywhere.
[00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:21.471]  Very well set up.
[00:17:22.112 --> 00:17:23.413]  But this is what he decided.
[00:17:24.537 --> 00:17:24.797]  This is
[00:17:44.827 --> 00:17:45.607]  All of them, basically.
[00:17:45.667 --> 00:17:46.687]  Pretty much all of them.
[00:17:47.068 --> 00:17:52.029]  And, um, you know, those are, those are his... Inside baseball.
[00:17:52.049 --> 00:17:57.690]  That I wasn't part of, so I don't know exactly what was... He was just telling me that a lot of people are awake now.
[00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.390]  Which I pick up on as well, talking to folks.
[00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:01.171]  Yeah, slowly but surely.
[00:18:01.611 --> 00:18:03.171]  You know, slowly but surely.
[00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:08.593]  And that's why this film, Amerageddon, is so important, because, you know, we get our information in different ways.
[00:18:08.973 --> 00:18:11.093]  Um, you know, I enjoy your show every day.
[00:18:11.113 --> 00:18:13.914]  Um, I enjoy movies, uh, that...
[00:18:14.847 --> 00:18:15.948]  You know, I enjoy a lot of movies.
[00:18:32.639 --> 00:18:33.879]  That's a question I had for you.
[00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:36.661]  Ten years ago, you'd see no anti-New World Order stuff.
[00:18:36.701 --> 00:18:44.545]  Now, Superman, the new Captain America, so many of these plots are false flags, corrupt groups.
[00:18:46.146 --> 00:18:47.226]  Folks say it's like my show.
[00:18:47.746 --> 00:18:48.667]  What do you think that's about?
[00:18:48.887 --> 00:18:50.648]  No, I think you're 100% right.
[00:18:50.768 --> 00:18:58.112]  I think what they're trying to do is dumb us down, desensitize us to what's really happening, so when it does take place, it's like,
[00:18:58.872 --> 00:18:59.793]  Okay, well it's here.
[00:18:59.833 --> 00:19:00.794]  We kind of saw it coming.
[00:19:01.234 --> 00:19:02.875]  Well, I don't buy that.
[00:19:03.055 --> 00:19:03.996]  They're taking the edge off.
[00:19:04.336 --> 00:19:06.939]  They're taking the edge off, and a lot of people are buying it.
[00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:15.445]  What we're doing with Amerigeddon is we've just ripped off all the shiny, pretty stuff that they put in their films, and we just tell the truth.
[00:19:15.646 --> 00:19:22.031]  We call out who we need to call out, and we tell a story within the confines of what's going on in the world.
[00:19:24.653 --> 00:19:26.815]  Skip the break.
[00:19:27.396 --> 00:19:32.722]  Really what it's about is us taking our freedom back from the government.
[00:19:33.263 --> 00:19:34.104]  That's what we need to do.
[00:19:34.304 --> 00:19:35.585]  The government is running our lives.
[00:19:35.785 --> 00:19:37.808]  We're taking our freedom back.
[00:19:38.948 --> 00:19:40.269]  And ideas are bulletproof.
[00:19:40.309 --> 00:19:41.369]  This is revolutionary.
[00:19:41.829 --> 00:19:54.516]  I've seen, no exaggeration, since I've been on air 20-something years, more than 30 or 40 made-for-TV shows, other films, where it's always a radio host in a bunker, leading a revolution against the government, blowing up schools full of children.
[00:19:54.896 --> 00:19:56.937]  And in a lot of the shows, he's even named Alex.
[00:19:57.757 --> 00:19:59.958]  Or it'll say, From Texas, Alex Johnson.
[00:19:59.998 --> 00:20:02.159]  And then I'm killing everyone.
[00:20:02.479 --> 00:20:05.301]  And that's just them attacking me and others.
[00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:12.344]  They've got shows where Green Lantern fights guys with tri-corner hats that want to put poison in the New York Bay.
[00:20:12.364 --> 00:20:18.407]  I mean, they just everywhere are demonizing patriots and going after us.
[00:20:18.947 --> 00:20:22.669]  So you're basically countering them, but not with hidden propaganda.
[00:20:22.689 --> 00:20:24.210]  You're just putting it right out there against them.
[00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.131]  Right out in your face.
[00:20:27.111 --> 00:20:33.694]  It is, like Gary likes to say, this is a true story that hasn't happened yet.
[00:20:34.435 --> 00:20:34.835]  But it will.
[00:20:35.515 --> 00:20:35.895]  But it will.
[00:20:36.315 --> 00:20:37.296]  Well, look at Europe.
[00:20:37.316 --> 00:20:51.460]  They've used the radical Islamic invasion they brought in, they advertised, to declare civil emergency and draconian martial law laws in Germany and France where they ban demonstrations of nationalist groups but then let the socialists run around on the streets.
[00:20:51.721 --> 00:20:52.341]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:53.161 --> 00:20:58.183]  It was in full display of what was going on with the military in the streets and locking down the streets, martial law.
[00:20:59.283 --> 00:20:59.883]  It is coming.
[00:21:00.344 --> 00:21:01.324]  It's just a matter of time.
[00:21:02.495 --> 00:21:03.637]  Then they misrepresent.
[00:21:03.717 --> 00:21:06.440]  We come out and say, hey, here's this Jade Helm, Army.mil.
[00:21:07.181 --> 00:21:09.204]  They say it's, you know, partisan takeover of hostile areas.
[00:21:09.284 --> 00:21:13.289]  We don't believe this is an imminent takeover, but it's more conditioning of our troops to accept this.
[00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:14.150]  They spin it.
[00:21:14.471 --> 00:21:15.672]  Alex Jones hates the military.
[00:21:15.692 --> 00:21:18.716]  He says they're coming to Texas this summer to kill everybody and take their guns.
[00:21:19.557 --> 00:21:22.538]  And then, since they put that out, people don't trust the government.
[00:21:22.598 --> 00:21:26.319]  They get scared from what hundreds of newspapers and TV stations said.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:31.601]  They get scared by the media saying that and believe it's happening because my name's attached to it.
[00:21:32.122 --> 00:21:33.682]  And then they come out and say, see, it didn't happen.
[00:21:33.722 --> 00:21:34.602]  Alex Jones was a liar.
[00:21:34.983 --> 00:21:36.443]  I'm not talking about myself here, folks.
[00:21:36.703 --> 00:21:38.904]  You just need to know these are the tricks they engage in.
[00:21:39.204 --> 00:21:41.287]  Yeah, no, I agree with you.
[00:21:41.327 --> 00:21:42.508]  I agree with you 100% there.
[00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:49.878]  It's crazy the rabbit hole they're trying to push us down and I'm done.
[00:21:49.898 --> 00:21:53.362]  I was always kind of a quiet,
[00:21:55.985 --> 00:21:57.566]  You know, I didn't want to jump off the cliff 100%.
[00:21:58.986 --> 00:22:00.247]  I wanted to hold back a little bit.
[00:22:00.467 --> 00:22:01.187]  I had my views.
[00:22:01.547 --> 00:22:03.488]  I believe everything you're talking about.
[00:22:03.808 --> 00:22:05.569]  But I was just holding back.
[00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:09.210]  And it's not until now where we really need to make that choice.
[00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:10.891]  Are we in or are we out?
[00:22:11.191 --> 00:22:12.431]  Because you can't play in the middle.
[00:22:12.671 --> 00:22:14.592]  If you get played in the middle, you're dead.
[00:22:15.192 --> 00:22:18.814]  Never truer words have been spoken than what you just said, Mike Norris.
[00:22:19.394 --> 00:22:23.616]  I always think about the fact I've got to intensify what I'm doing, work even harder, or I've got to completely quit.
[00:22:23.977 --> 00:22:26.058]  I can't just back off halfway or back off 80%.
[00:22:26.718 --> 00:22:28.239]  And then it's a choice.
[00:22:28.259 --> 00:22:30.020]  I mean, I could take my children fishing and hunting more.
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:30.940]  I could be in better shape.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.381]  So I'm trying to get back in better shape.
[00:22:32.681 --> 00:22:33.582]  But I've just made the choice.
[00:22:34.042 --> 00:22:34.622]  I'm all in.
[00:22:34.922 --> 00:22:35.903]  I'm 100% committed.
[00:22:36.123 --> 00:22:36.483]  That's it.
[00:22:36.583 --> 00:22:36.903]  I'm done.
[00:22:36.923 --> 00:22:38.284]  I couldn't do it any other way.
[00:22:38.444 --> 00:22:39.945]  Yeah, no, I agree with you.
[00:22:40.285 --> 00:22:54.055]  And that's why it's so important on this film that we get the support, that we get the people to go to the Amerageddon Facebook page, the Amerageddon, the film website to really support us because this is it.
[00:22:54.355 --> 00:22:58.397]  We are going full in to create content that is going to expose
[00:22:59.358 --> 00:23:00.959]  What is happening behind the scenes?
[00:23:01.259 --> 00:23:02.679]  And there is a demonic elite.
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.681]  And I really believe it's a spiritual warfare.
[00:23:05.961 --> 00:23:10.022]  Behind it all, there is a spiritual warfare going on that is dictating what's happening.
[00:23:10.082 --> 00:23:12.483]  I want to talk more about that right now and then come back and play the trailer.
[00:23:12.523 --> 00:23:13.684]  We just skipped this network break.
[00:23:14.244 --> 00:23:15.725]  You're just announcing the trailer today.
[00:23:15.745 --> 00:23:16.585]  You're just launching it.
[00:23:16.885 --> 00:23:18.626]  The Facebook just got launched minutes ago.
[00:23:18.646 --> 00:23:19.706]  300 and something likes.
[00:23:20.126 --> 00:23:24.908]  I want to put up the top of our main Facebook that has a million followers and the others that have several million as well.
[00:23:25.268 --> 00:23:27.069]  Twitter, everywhere.
[00:23:27.109 --> 00:23:28.930]  But I want to ask listeners, you have the real power.
[00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:31.531]  When I get up here and push something, it reaches a few million people.
[00:23:31.911 --> 00:23:35.672]  If you don't decide to take action and carry that ball, it does nothing.
[00:23:36.032 --> 00:23:42.534]  I want to see 5 million views, 10 million views conservatively by next week on the Amerageddon trailer.
[00:23:43.314 --> 00:23:48.456]  I want to see a couple hundred thousand likes per minimum on the Amerageddon trailer.
[00:23:49.336 --> 00:23:58.703]  Facebook, and on the website, because again, this is about creating patriot, anti-globalist markets for this type of material.
[00:23:59.023 --> 00:24:05.969]  And if this is even moderately successful, then they're going to commit to a flotilla of not just these films, but other films.
[00:24:06.249 --> 00:24:08.210]  We've been talking behind the scenes, a lot of stuff.
[00:24:08.671 --> 00:24:14.255]  This is about leaving Hollywood, leaving the censorship, and really putting your money where your mouth is.
[00:24:14.295 --> 00:24:18.238]  I mean, it's hard to have jets and helicopters and full... I mean, how big was this budget?
[00:24:20.013 --> 00:24:21.596]  Millions and millions of dollars.
[00:24:21.616 --> 00:24:24.460]  We're not going to say.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.645]  Mr. Haven was very generous, but he is very smart.
[00:24:28.306 --> 00:24:32.893]  And so we had some guidelines, but I had everything I needed to make this film.
[00:24:33.763 --> 00:24:44.365]  Well, I mean, I've been on some pretty big films, and as a consultant but also in them, you know, fell into some link letter films you invited me to be in, and this was bigger crews and budgets, and it was pretty professional.
[00:24:44.385 --> 00:24:54.327]  Yeah, we had a great time, a great crew, you know, and it's interesting because a lot of the people that just came on to work on the film are getting really skittish right now.
[00:24:54.487 --> 00:24:57.827]  I've had phone calls, uh, could you change my name in the credits?
[00:24:58.467 --> 00:25:01.288]  By the way, because you guys have got a bunch of big actors and actresses, tell folks.
[00:25:01.308 --> 00:25:07.571]  Yeah, yeah, we've got Dina Meyer, Anna Lynn McCord, we have got the awesome Marshall Teague.
[00:25:07.931 --> 00:25:10.452]  Marshall Teague, to me, is one of the most brilliant actors.
[00:25:11.173 --> 00:25:13.354]  We've got this guy, he played a great part.
[00:25:14.014 --> 00:25:16.155]  Alex Jones was in the movie!
[00:25:17.136 --> 00:25:19.677]  No, but what was awesome about that was we go,
[00:25:20.888 --> 00:25:22.270]  Can you play something different?
[00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:24.093]  We want you to play the bad guy.
[00:25:24.173 --> 00:25:25.735]  We want you to be the enemy.
[00:25:26.116 --> 00:25:27.859]  And you pulled it off with mastery.
[00:25:28.199 --> 00:25:29.561]  Oh, you're nice.
[00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:31.084]  It was certainly fun.
[00:25:33.075 --> 00:25:34.076]  I just would love to do it again.
[00:25:34.436 --> 00:25:41.321]  Now, let's get into the demonic nature of all of this with Mike Norris, the film, Amerageddon, amerageddonthemovie.com.
[00:25:41.341 --> 00:25:42.962]  Folks, put it on your Facebook, on your Twitter.
[00:25:43.082 --> 00:25:43.322]  Please.
[00:25:43.362 --> 00:25:44.723]  Send it out to your friends and family.
[00:25:45.344 --> 00:25:50.187]  These guys have really committed to do this, and you don't want to get a lot into it on the air because it sounds like whining or complaining.
[00:25:50.467 --> 00:25:51.428]  It's a badge of courage.
[00:25:51.768 --> 00:25:53.530]  Before we get into the demonic stuff, which we'll do after the break,
[00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:55.352]  Talk about the censorship.
[00:25:55.392 --> 00:26:06.849]  I mean, people don't know that Homeland Security visited a major TV network that I was doing a show with and actually threatened them, and I'm not allowed to say what else happened, and it really makes me mad, but I was told in confidence, so I can't tell you.
[00:26:08.942 --> 00:26:09.362]  It was bad.
[00:26:09.902 --> 00:26:13.744]  And then, I mean, people don't know what goes on behind the scenes to shut stuff down.
[00:26:14.204 --> 00:26:16.505]  I've been thrown off XM, thrown off a bunch of affiliates.
[00:26:16.926 --> 00:26:19.207]  The stations get threatened, people come and offer them money.
[00:26:19.247 --> 00:26:22.848]  I mean, hundreds of thousands of dollars just for a few months just to get me off.
[00:26:23.589 --> 00:26:23.789]  I mean,
[00:26:24.569 --> 00:26:27.070]  There is a real move in this country, so understand.
[00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:29.931]  That's why I have kinship with Donald Trump.
[00:26:30.051 --> 00:26:34.872]  I know what it's like, not at his level, to be surrounded by wolves, shoving their knives in you.
[00:26:34.912 --> 00:26:39.654]  You're in the arena, and all these people are up there in the stands saying how he should do this, how he should do that.
[00:26:39.674 --> 00:26:40.074]  It doesn't matter.
[00:26:40.114 --> 00:26:40.854]  He's in the arena.
[00:26:41.134 --> 00:26:41.995]  It makes me respect him.
[00:26:42.255 --> 00:26:43.015]  You are in the arena.
[00:26:43.035 --> 00:26:45.216]  It's like your dad commended you for getting in it, but warns you.
[00:26:45.576 --> 00:26:46.176]  You're in the arena.
[00:26:46.216 --> 00:26:46.896]  Can you tell folks?
[00:26:47.216 --> 00:26:49.117]  I mean, you're not just saying, oh, this is being censored.
[00:26:49.377 --> 00:26:50.197]  Oh, they don't want it out.
[00:26:50.317 --> 00:26:51.278]  Oh, they won't distribute it.
[00:26:51.618 --> 00:26:52.258]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:26:53.206 --> 00:26:55.907]  I mean, Mike Judge told me, and everything he's done has been a hit.
[00:26:55.927 --> 00:26:56.767]  He's made billions of dollars.
[00:26:57.148 --> 00:26:58.628]  He told me, and I'm allowed to say it.
[00:26:59.789 --> 00:27:03.030]  When Fox saw Idiocracy, they said, this would be a hit.
[00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.231]  And by the way, they had a contract to make him make three movies.
[00:27:06.511 --> 00:27:07.492]  He was busy, he didn't want to do it.
[00:27:08.393 --> 00:27:10.675]  They said, we're not even going to list this or show this in theaters.
[00:27:10.695 --> 00:27:12.616]  Remember, it had all this hype, everybody wanted to see it.
[00:27:12.896 --> 00:27:15.999]  It's a huge hit in DVDs, made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:27:16.039 --> 00:27:21.062]  Now, they killed it because it showed how the public was being dumbed down and wasn't a message they wanted.
[00:27:21.322 --> 00:27:23.624]  That's how controlled it is, so I'm kind of ranting about it.
[00:27:23.644 --> 00:27:24.865]  I have hundreds of these stories.
[00:27:25.265 --> 00:27:31.530]  Folks don't understand that Mike Judge came on the show, gave his only political interview ever, and he said, I hope I don't get audited by the IRS for saying this.
[00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:37.374]  But they basically tell people in Hollywood, you keep your mouth shut or you'll never work again.
[00:27:37.574 --> 00:27:40.597]  And it doesn't matter if you've made three billion dollars like Mike Judge.
[00:27:40.637 --> 00:27:40.937]  Go ahead.
[00:27:40.957 --> 00:27:42.158]  Yeah, no, you're right.
[00:27:42.739 --> 00:27:43.660]  We're running in.
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:48.204]  We ran into that in Hollywood, sent out the screeners.
[00:27:48.364 --> 00:27:49.905]  Everybody goes, whoo, really good film.
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:56.504]  Not one person would touch it, even though every one of them said this thing is going to get a lot of support.
[00:27:56.804 --> 00:27:58.665]  Not one studio would touch it.
[00:27:58.906 --> 00:27:59.806]  So Gary said, you know what?
[00:27:59.946 --> 00:28:00.267]  Forget it.
[00:28:00.387 --> 00:28:01.207]  We'll do it ourselves.
[00:28:01.928 --> 00:28:08.072]  And so that's why we're going to open this film March 2nd in theaters in Texas on Texas Independence Day.
[00:28:08.952 --> 00:28:11.094]  And it's just so important that
[00:28:12.719 --> 00:28:13.099]  It's us.
[00:28:13.199 --> 00:28:13.640]  It's me.
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.981]  It's you that come out and support this film.
[00:28:16.001 --> 00:28:21.065]  I cannot emphasize that enough that all of us rally together.
[00:28:21.345 --> 00:28:25.908]  We become an army of one and we support this film and other films that will come out like it.
[00:28:26.428 --> 00:28:27.209]  Very important.
[00:28:27.889 --> 00:28:28.930]  We're on an island.
[00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.131]  We're fighting a war.
[00:28:30.431 --> 00:28:31.312]  We are fighting a war.
[00:28:31.412 --> 00:28:34.073]  So we got to stick together.
[00:28:34.294 --> 00:28:34.674]  Everyone.
[00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:35.970]  Absolutely.
[00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:38.492]  And look, you've got all these big TV shows, movies.
[00:28:38.992 --> 00:28:40.052]  You're not doing this for money.
[00:28:40.072 --> 00:28:41.153]  Remember, we talked behind the scenes.
[00:28:41.173 --> 00:28:45.855]  You've got more work than you could ever deal with, with all the TV shows you produce, not just Walker and the rest of it.
[00:28:45.875 --> 00:28:51.058]  I mean, you knew you would get further blackballed for doing this, but it was almost just the challenge to do it.
[00:28:51.118 --> 00:28:54.279]  Now you've done it, and it's better than I thought it'd be with the budget.
[00:28:54.299 --> 00:28:57.241]  I mean, some parts of it look like beyond the Godfather they're so good.
[00:28:57.641 --> 00:29:00.142]  Other parts, you know, are fun, but better than TV.
[00:29:00.162 --> 00:29:03.063]  I mean, that's my real review of it, but the content is five-star.
[00:29:04.304 --> 00:29:05.865]  I'm really honored to be involved in this.
[00:29:06.286 --> 00:29:07.467]  Yeah, I appreciate that.
[00:29:07.787 --> 00:29:15.014]  It was, you know, Gary just put in so much time and effort into every word that is in this film.
[00:29:15.634 --> 00:29:17.596]  We speak on the Second Amendment.
[00:29:17.796 --> 00:29:19.898]  We speak on the government coming to take our weapons.
[00:29:19.918 --> 00:29:21.119]  You lay out the whole blueprint.
[00:29:21.419 --> 00:29:21.840]  Everything.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:22.681]  Everything.
[00:29:23.241 --> 00:29:29.066]  Before this all started, I was in the dark and I'm thinking, what on earth is Gary thinking here?
[00:29:29.927 --> 00:29:33.791]  But, the more I research it, then that's when I start figuring it out.
[00:29:33.811 --> 00:29:34.351]  Holy crap.
[00:29:34.471 --> 00:29:35.392]  Well, that's what you said at first.
[00:29:35.412 --> 00:29:37.714]  You were kind of ambivalent, and by the time you were making it, you liked it.
[00:29:37.754 --> 00:29:38.314]  Now you love it.
[00:29:38.615 --> 00:29:38.895]  Love it.
[00:29:39.235 --> 00:29:39.516]  I'm in.
[00:29:39.636 --> 00:29:39.956]  I'm sold.
[00:29:39.976 --> 00:29:41.677]  High five, baby!
[00:29:41.878 --> 00:29:48.383]  When we come back with Mike Norris, there it is, the firstborn progeny of the great King Norris in front of us.
[00:29:48.443 --> 00:29:49.925]  I know your dad's probably listening.
[00:29:50.365 --> 00:29:51.146]  Look at me being goofy.
[00:29:51.166 --> 00:29:51.846]  That's what I do, though.
[00:29:52.106 --> 00:29:58.250]  We're going to be right back, ladies and gentlemen, to play the trailer and get into other world news with Mike Norrish, the film, Amerageddon.
[00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:59.531]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.031 --> 00:30:01.632]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.553 --> 00:30:05.235]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.972 --> 00:30:23.048]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays, which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants.
[00:30:24.352 --> 00:30:36.101]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI, who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure agreements, forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[00:30:36.341 --> 00:30:52.633]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment, and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying, where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[00:30:53.073 --> 00:30:56.336]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming.
[00:30:56.656 --> 00:30:57.657]  It's already here.
[00:30:58.077 --> 00:31:01.820]  This is Darren McBreen and I invite you to join the resistance.
[00:31:02.301 --> 00:31:02.761]  Infowars.com
[00:31:08.877 --> 00:31:15.799]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:31:33.104 --> 00:31:40.570]  Infowarslife.com developed Silver Bullet by closely working with one of the top silver manufacturing labs in the United States.
[00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:44.273]  We set out to bring you the very best at the lowest price.

[00:32:08.536 --> 00:32:09.176]  I want more candy!
[00:32:09.196 --> 00:32:09.937]  I want more baby again!
[00:32:10.057 --> 00:32:10.577]  Mine, mine, mine!
[00:32:11.738 --> 00:32:21.142]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:32:21.462 --> 00:32:24.083]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:32:24.183 --> 00:32:27.545]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:32:27.725 --> 00:32:33.748]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[00:32:34.048 --> 00:32:36.569]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[00:32:36.769 --> 00:32:36.949]  I'm good.
[00:32:56.687 --> 00:33:00.575]  Like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[00:33:26.596 --> 00:33:33.091]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:34.575]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:40.942 --> 00:33:43.545]  The reason I'm here today is to encourage the U.S.
[00:33:43.605 --> 00:33:48.071]  Congress to take action to protect our country from its most imminent threat.
[00:33:48.872 --> 00:33:53.277]  Electricity would cease, the internet would go down, and the banking system.
[00:33:54.119 --> 00:33:58.224]  The smokescreen of national security used by government at every level.
[00:33:59.315 --> 00:34:02.138]  A strong America is the only thing standing in the way.
[00:34:02.358 --> 00:34:03.960]  Country only needs a little chaos.
[00:34:05.041 --> 00:34:08.525]  We have a fog that has descended on our entire nation.
[00:34:09.847 --> 00:34:11.228]  Hello, Mr. President.
[00:34:11.789 --> 00:34:13.150]  Now is the time.
[00:34:14.131 --> 00:34:16.894]  The average American family only has three days of food.
[00:34:17.395 --> 00:34:18.756]  We need to talk face-to-face.
[00:34:18.776 --> 00:34:19.677]  This is important.
[00:34:20.618 --> 00:34:21.318]  Sir, what's the mission?
[00:34:21.478 --> 00:34:23.759]  Disarm the population and restore order!
[00:34:23.779 --> 00:34:26.860]  Do you have any weapons inside your home or on your person?
[00:34:27.361 --> 00:34:33.263]  You had to give the president power to arrest any American by simply accusing them of terrorism.
[00:34:33.883 --> 00:34:36.424]  The vanity of nationalism will quickly fade.
[00:34:36.764 --> 00:34:39.945]  These are but the birth pangs of a new world order.
[00:34:40.686 --> 00:34:44.147]  I'm just so afraid of the world that you're gonna have to grow up in.
[00:34:44.307 --> 00:34:49.329]  This is a time, man, woman, young or old, when folks run and hide.
[00:34:50.246 --> 00:34:51.908]  Or they pull up their bootstraps and they fight.
[00:34:54.932 --> 00:34:59.939]  When you sell your soul to one time thing, there's no going back.
[00:35:03.712 --> 00:35:11.216]  Amerageddon, and it hits theaters coming up on March 2nd, Texas Independence Day, and we need to get around this Hollywood blockade.
[00:35:11.256 --> 00:35:20.260]  If it sells out the first few days in the theaters where it opens in Texas, that will then break the blockade, just like we did with America 2016 and the rest of it.
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:28.204]  And again, I wasn't making money off of America 2016, but I helped promote it, helped push it, just as you did, to make sure it got around the censors and had a big effect.
[00:35:28.584 --> 00:35:30.165]  They of course arrested Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:35:30.405 --> 00:35:32.385]  Then we talk about the censorship and the stuff that goes on.
[00:35:32.926 --> 00:35:35.947]  They basically told him we're doing this because of your film and the next film that was coming out.
[00:35:36.347 --> 00:35:37.787]  They want to intimidate people.
[00:35:38.227 --> 00:35:39.368]  They want to shut people down.
[00:35:39.408 --> 00:35:50.052]  They sent him for psychological psychiatric evaluation for nine months after he was in prison over campaign issues and even the psychiatrists laughed and said this is all political persecution.
[00:35:50.072 --> 00:35:56.114]  So the good news is there's good people throughout the system that know this is a fraud but they don't want you to see
[00:35:57.324 --> 00:35:57.724]  America
[00:36:27.404 --> 00:36:30.005]  Film exposes military training to confiscate guns.
[00:36:30.566 --> 00:36:32.587]  You can even put, you know, Norris.
[00:36:32.847 --> 00:36:35.408]  Norris directs film exposing plan to confiscate guns.
[00:36:35.428 --> 00:36:38.630]  I know your dad's gonna help out with World Net Daily and so much more.
[00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:42.792]  Again, to push a whole new genre, just like your dad did from the grassroots.
[00:36:43.112 --> 00:36:43.772]  I mean, explain that.
[00:36:44.312 --> 00:36:49.615]  Your dad, with his films, grassroots to dominate Hollywood for over a decade, unprecedented what your dad did.
[00:36:49.815 --> 00:36:51.376]  You guys are getting ready to do it again with this.
[00:36:51.516 --> 00:36:56.318]  Yeah, no, we're going to do the same thing he did back in the late 70s, early 80s.
[00:36:56.638 --> 00:37:02.941]  He'd make a movie, he'd take it to a theater called Four Walling, rent the theater, and have people come in and see it.
[00:37:03.181 --> 00:37:07.062]  And that's pretty much, I think, the same thing we're going to do with this in Texas.
[00:37:07.142 --> 00:37:07.783]  I just think it's...
[00:37:09.263 --> 00:37:11.124]  I like it that I'm a Texan.
[00:37:11.724 --> 00:37:14.584]  I live in the greatest state we have in America.
[00:37:14.824 --> 00:37:17.025]  I believe Texas is the greatest state we have.
[00:37:17.245 --> 00:37:19.966]  It's the greatest country within America, I think.
[00:37:19.986 --> 00:37:23.366]  I used to always hear that growing up and roll my eyes.
[00:37:23.406 --> 00:37:30.028]  You don't listen to your parents and grandparents, but after I've been here and seen the difference in what old Texas was, absolutely it's great people.
[00:37:30.188 --> 00:37:31.748]  Yeah, and I'm from Los Angeles.
[00:37:31.868 --> 00:37:33.349]  I was born and raised in L.A.
[00:37:33.749 --> 00:37:35.329]  By the grace of God, I got out of there.
[00:37:35.569 --> 00:37:36.430]  I'm a full-blood Texan.
[00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:39.150]  But you were partially raised by Steve McQueen, so... Ah, he did.
[00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:40.410]  He taught me how to ride a motorcycle.
[00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:42.091]  Few things Trump didn't from Texas.
[00:37:42.171 --> 00:37:43.151]  Yeah, no.
[00:37:43.191 --> 00:37:45.292]  But your daddy's from Oklahoma, which used to be part of Texas.
[00:37:45.712 --> 00:37:46.232]  Did it really?
[00:37:46.312 --> 00:37:46.772]  Oh, yeah.
[00:37:47.332 --> 00:37:48.472]  I thought we were part of Mexico.
[00:37:48.732 --> 00:37:49.513]  You were that, too.
[00:37:49.793 --> 00:37:51.473]  Have you seen the original Texas Territory?
[00:37:51.493 --> 00:37:52.333]  Let's put it up on screen.
[00:37:52.633 --> 00:37:53.174]  Yeah, it was big.
[00:37:53.194 --> 00:37:54.594]  It went all the way up to Colorado.
[00:37:55.174 --> 00:37:57.198]  Uh, we don't learn that in school in California.
[00:37:57.539 --> 00:37:59.363]  We just learn about earthquakes.
[00:37:59.704 --> 00:37:59.904]  No.
[00:38:00.525 --> 00:38:02.449]  Folks, show them original Texas map.
[00:38:03.342 --> 00:38:05.123]  Yeah, it was almost as big as Louisiana Purchase.
[00:38:05.163 --> 00:38:06.264]  Wow, that's crazy.
[00:38:06.284 --> 00:38:07.545]  Yeah, but keep going, sorry.
[00:38:07.565 --> 00:38:10.266]  Yeah, but no, and that's what's really exciting.
[00:38:10.526 --> 00:38:11.287]  Oh, look at that.
[00:38:11.307 --> 00:38:11.747]  Part of Oklahoma.
[00:38:12.287 --> 00:38:13.128]  Yeah, sure is.
[00:38:13.548 --> 00:38:14.849]  Well, learn something every day.
[00:38:14.889 --> 00:38:16.890]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:20.993]  But that's what's really exciting is we've got a starting point.
[00:38:21.913 --> 00:38:26.596]  We appreciate you guys so much at InfoWars, just how you've supported us, how you were
[00:38:26.636 --> 00:38:27.777]  David Knight's in the trailer.
[00:38:27.797 --> 00:38:28.757]  David Knight's in the trailer.
[00:38:28.937 --> 00:38:31.779]  David Knight did an amazing job in the opening.
[00:38:31.799 --> 00:38:37.282]  It's a little opening we've got to just kind of give an overview of where we are in the world today.
[00:38:37.622 --> 00:38:41.144]  And that's where our story picks up with you and Gary going head to head.
[00:38:41.364 --> 00:38:43.305]  I wonder if we'll see David Knight in future films.
[00:38:44.105 --> 00:38:44.766]  Very possible.
[00:38:44.806 --> 00:38:47.687]  And the door sidekick Chuck Norris comes through.
[00:38:48.128 --> 00:38:50.209]  But our goal ultimately is
[00:38:51.861 --> 00:38:52.222]  I think
[00:39:09.255 --> 00:39:10.135]  They have to show it.
[00:39:10.475 --> 00:39:11.216]  They have to show it.
[00:39:11.776 --> 00:39:14.076]  And you've done that a lot with TV shows, over and over again.
[00:39:14.277 --> 00:39:14.757]  Absolutely.
[00:39:15.237 --> 00:39:16.617]  It's not just Walker, Texas Ranger.
[00:39:16.637 --> 00:39:18.398]  You yourself have rolled out a bunch of big TV shows.
[00:39:18.418 --> 00:39:24.720]  Yeah, I've worked on, you know, my brother was the stunt coordinator, second year director on Chase, Prison Break.
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:29.601]  So I was able to go work on these shows, work on great films, Rush Hour films.
[00:39:29.941 --> 00:39:31.662]  So I've done a lot of stuff.
[00:39:32.202 --> 00:39:35.723]  The thing is, once I did Amerigeddon, that's it.
[00:39:36.123 --> 00:39:38.423]  I am now that guy doing those movies.
[00:39:38.763 --> 00:39:39.384]  And I'm all in.
[00:39:40.004 --> 00:39:40.484]  I'm all in.
[00:39:41.104 --> 00:39:43.204]  I sold my soul to God.
[00:39:43.965 --> 00:39:48.806]  I will tell a story about this, just so folks get another example of the censorship, and I could care less, I love it.
[00:39:49.906 --> 00:39:53.947]  I knew back when I was on the set of Scanner Darkly, consulting for it, but also in it,
[00:39:55.523 --> 00:40:01.245]  With a great guy, Rick Linklater, who's a true liberal slash libertarian, classical liberal, not the modern fascist type.
[00:40:02.026 --> 00:40:05.127]  But he runs the Austin, Texas Film Societies and stuff like that.
[00:40:05.187 --> 00:40:09.209]  And Robert Rodriguez was out there at the old airport where they have a whole shooting facility.
[00:40:09.669 --> 00:40:11.250]  That was first when they opened that at the old airport.
[00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:18.293]  And some of my films have been given by one of the stunt directors to Rodriguez's wife at the time.
[00:40:19.073 --> 00:40:25.776]  And she liked the films, but she, you know, I basically was told, well, but Rodriguez doesn't like you, blah, blah, blah, and all this stuff, because he wants a low reconquista and all the rest of it.
[00:40:26.116 --> 00:40:29.918]  So he's kind of, in my view, in my opinion, like a white racist when he's a Hispanic racist.
[00:40:30.618 --> 00:40:32.719]  And he's shown that with some of the stuff he's done.
[00:40:32.739 --> 00:40:35.921]  But, you know, regardless, I'm against all folks being based on race stuff.
[00:40:36.221 --> 00:40:38.362]  And he's a very talented director, so I'm not attacking him.
[00:40:39.272 --> 00:40:44.736]  Then, I was given the script of Machete, and I just said, here's this script, it's incredibly race-baiting.
[00:40:45.256 --> 00:40:48.318]  My gosh, and I knew it was being partially funded through the Democrats and others.
[00:40:48.718 --> 00:40:58.725]  I later confirmed from inside sources that he's met with Obama, with his channel, TV channel he's launched, it's meant for this whole, you know, A Clash of Civilizations garbage, George Soros funding Black Lives Matter.
[00:40:59.085 --> 00:41:05.609]  So, I'm for reforming the police problems, but I'm not for just overthrowing the government, you know, having some communist takeover, which your film kind of covers.
[00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:07.771]  Well, it doesn't kind of cover it, it does.
[00:41:09.142 --> 00:41:09.862]  Alex Jones is a liar!
[00:41:24.844 --> 00:41:29.490]  Perry already wanted to cut some of the film incentives in Texas because they were being selectively given.
[00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:31.572]  They wouldn't give them to conservative groups, libertarian groups.
[00:41:31.812 --> 00:41:36.959]  They wouldn't give them to a group that was making a film about Waco that was even a liberal group that was against it.
[00:41:37.519 --> 00:41:41.624]  And so I said it's wrong to not give the film incentives to everybody.
[00:41:41.845 --> 00:41:42.646]  You're making a film.
[00:41:43.951 --> 00:41:44.471]  We're good to go.
[00:42:06.568 --> 00:42:09.170]  We can't get somebody from Austin to change a lightbulb in here.
[00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:09.971]  Well, that was better.
[00:42:09.991 --> 00:42:11.211]  We were going to have locals build our set.
[00:42:11.572 --> 00:42:14.534]  We just hired the folks that built the Fox News studios out of New York.
[00:42:14.834 --> 00:42:15.835]  Oh, you hurt us so bad.
[00:42:15.855 --> 00:42:17.656]  You know, we just hired folks from outside.
[00:42:17.676 --> 00:42:18.717]  I mean, big deal.
[00:42:18.757 --> 00:42:19.037]  Great.
[00:42:19.057 --> 00:42:20.278]  But then we hire folks out of Dallas.
[00:42:20.758 --> 00:42:25.502]  But I've had people as far away as Dallas working here and they go, I just got a call from Rodriguez.
[00:42:25.622 --> 00:42:26.983]  I'll never work again if I work with you.
[00:42:27.203 --> 00:42:28.404]  And that's how Hollywood works.
[00:42:28.464 --> 00:42:29.204]  Explain that to people.
[00:42:29.245 --> 00:42:32.067]  Yeah, no, that's exactly how it is.
[00:42:32.087 --> 00:42:35.229]  You know, people do get blackballed out of Hollywood.
[00:42:36.397 --> 00:42:38.738]  I mean, down to the point where I can't even get crew in here!
[00:42:39.118 --> 00:42:41.440]  Yeah, I get it there.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.180]  And you know what?
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:46.963]  They've got their hands inside the unions and everything.
[00:42:47.003 --> 00:42:49.104]  Well, show us how they're thugs trying to run what we do.
[00:42:49.264 --> 00:42:50.465]  I'm not in Hollywood.
[00:42:50.485 --> 00:42:51.645]  I've got a media operation.
[00:42:52.105 --> 00:42:53.166]  And that's just like us.
[00:42:53.366 --> 00:42:54.086]  That's just like us.
[00:42:54.487 --> 00:42:55.327]  We make movies.
[00:42:55.467 --> 00:42:56.128]  We make movies.
[00:42:58.329 --> 00:42:59.449]  Yeah, it's tough.
[00:42:59.589 --> 00:43:02.051]  And I don't know what's going on down in Austin with Rodriguez.
[00:43:03.132 --> 00:43:04.052]  I'm not trying to get you into that.
[00:43:04.072 --> 00:43:06.354]  I'm just showing you inside baseball that I've experienced.
[00:43:06.814 --> 00:43:12.696]  Talk about the type of stuff Hollywood does, the spiritual darkness you've talked about, why you say it's a satanic conspiracy.
[00:43:12.896 --> 00:43:20.500]  Because I agree, at the end of the day, these people do stuff in power that isn't even good for them and their families or their bottom line, but they have a mission.
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:22.701]  They're bound together by that mystery of evil.
[00:43:22.901 --> 00:43:29.824]  Yeah, I think the world, the whole world, and the elites are demonic.
[00:43:30.264 --> 00:43:30.764]  I really do.
[00:43:31.144 --> 00:43:37.647]  I believe they have sold their soul to the devil for power, for money, and they want chaos.
[00:43:37.727 --> 00:43:39.487]  They need chaos to take over.
[00:43:39.968 --> 00:43:45.650]  It says in the movie, you know, all America needs is a little chaos for us to take over.
[00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:52.534]  And it shows the UN and globalists, he's the Soros character, admittedly, creating the destabilization.
[00:43:52.554 --> 00:43:53.835]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:43:54.115 --> 00:43:55.616]  And it's happening.
[00:43:55.656 --> 00:43:57.658]  It's all happening right in front of us right now.
[00:43:57.678 --> 00:43:59.139]  All you got to do is turn on the TV.
[00:43:59.599 --> 00:44:00.219]  And I'm done.
[00:44:00.299 --> 00:44:02.881]  I'm done turning on the TV because all they're telling me is lies.
[00:44:03.301 --> 00:44:05.142]  So this is where I'm getting my information.
[00:44:05.162 --> 00:44:08.164]  I'm getting my information from you, from Drudge.
[00:44:08.565 --> 00:44:09.705]  That's where we need to
[00:44:11.146 --> 00:44:13.387]  People really need to go out and start studying.
[00:44:13.567 --> 00:44:18.468]  Well, I gotta say, Breitbart was always really good, but they just do break a lot of hardcore news.
[00:44:18.888 --> 00:44:19.968]  So does Daily Caller.
[00:44:20.469 --> 00:44:25.010]  I mean, they are really exposing, so is InfoWars, but people say, man, why do you promote your competition?
[00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:26.430]  It's not competition!
[00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.831]  I mean, we're gonna lose everything if we don't turn this around, folks.
[00:44:30.091 --> 00:44:31.793]  No, you're 100% right.
[00:44:32.013 --> 00:44:33.274]  And we're losing right now.
[00:44:33.514 --> 00:44:34.275]  But we will win!
[00:44:35.356 --> 00:44:36.077]  We are going to win this.
[00:44:36.117 --> 00:44:37.058]  World Net Daily's excellent.
[00:44:37.238 --> 00:44:38.339]  Yeah, World Net Daily, yeah.
[00:44:38.799 --> 00:44:40.601]  But we're going to win.
[00:44:40.741 --> 00:44:46.306]  And, man, what people got to understand, this is not, this isn't a joke.
[00:44:46.647 --> 00:44:47.928]  This is going to be horrible.
[00:44:48.088 --> 00:44:54.034]  The Supreme Court Justice, I can't name him, came to drudge and said, they're going to start trying to shut the media down next year.
[00:44:54.474 --> 00:44:56.156]  Yeah, and it's going to be horrible.
[00:44:56.777 --> 00:45:02.504]  And once they start trying to really take away our guns, that's when it's really going to fall apart.
[00:45:02.784 --> 00:45:03.605]  I'm not giving up mine.
[00:45:04.505 --> 00:45:08.468]  And they know that that will trigger the civil war, which is the ultimate false flag.
[00:45:08.708 --> 00:45:23.419]  Because if they've war-gamed it and know it'll start a war, it's unconstitutional, it'll cause higher crime, it's evil, and they go ahead and do it, just like they destabilized Syria or Ukraine, are the elites really going to let George Soros and Hillary Clinton and others and Obama really try to run that here?
[00:45:23.679 --> 00:45:27.482]  I mean, you people, and look, we have General Flynn, all these other top generals coming out saying,
[00:45:27.822 --> 00:45:29.723]  Our government runs Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[00:45:29.783 --> 00:45:30.244]  It's wrong.
[00:45:30.664 --> 00:45:31.345]  It was willful.
[00:45:31.785 --> 00:45:32.285]  It's evil.
[00:45:32.405 --> 00:45:33.406]  It needs to be investigated.
[00:45:33.766 --> 00:45:38.369]  That is almost Valkyrie-level World War II, the German military going after Hitler.
[00:45:38.509 --> 00:45:40.991]  That's one inch away from that next move.
[00:45:41.251 --> 00:45:48.296]  Oh, imagine a Chuck Norris movie with a $100 million budget with him as a colonel leading a command group, kicking a U.N.
[00:45:48.336 --> 00:45:51.178]  takeover army basically out of D.C.
[00:45:51.218 --> 00:45:51.779]  or something.
[00:45:52.559 --> 00:45:53.440]  That would be the movie.
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:55.461]  Oh yeah.
[00:45:55.581 --> 00:45:56.321]  That would be cool.
[00:45:56.522 --> 00:45:59.643]  But it really goes back.
[00:45:59.963 --> 00:46:02.445]  We are all in a fight and we're on our side.
[00:46:02.625 --> 00:46:03.625]  We're the good guys here.
[00:46:04.266 --> 00:46:07.007]  And your listeners and your viewers are the good guys.
[00:46:07.328 --> 00:46:07.848]  I agree.
[00:46:08.288 --> 00:46:08.748]  It's an epic fight.
[00:46:09.049 --> 00:46:12.370]  Who was the famous gray-haired guy that played in Westerns and other combat movies?
[00:46:12.971 --> 00:46:16.052]  The gray-haired guy that's like the commander in Delta Force and your dad's?
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:21.881]  Pull up IMDb, Delta Force, Delta Force One, Chuck Norris.
[00:46:22.441 --> 00:46:24.742]  The point is your dad can now... Lee Marvin.
[00:46:24.802 --> 00:46:25.282]  Lee Marvin.
[00:46:25.302 --> 00:46:31.283]  Your dad can now, he doesn't look as old as Lee Marvin did, but your dad has got to now play the Lee Marvin character in movies like this.
[00:46:31.804 --> 00:46:33.144]  Like Bring Back Snake Plissken.
[00:46:33.184 --> 00:46:33.784]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:46:34.344 --> 00:46:35.024]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:46:35.304 --> 00:46:37.985]  Chuck Norris, Lee Marvin, Delta Force.
[00:46:38.585 --> 00:46:38.805]  Yeah.
[00:46:38.945 --> 00:46:43.567]  I was with my dad at Thanksgiving and I gotta tell you, he looks great.
[00:46:44.027 --> 00:46:45.827]  I mean, he's in... Look at that commie voting.
[00:46:45.847 --> 00:46:45.827]  5.5.
[00:46:46.027 --> 00:46:46.868]  It deserves 10 stars.
[00:46:48.632 --> 00:46:49.133]  That's Hollywood.
[00:46:49.153 --> 00:46:50.974]  I think I'm going to buy Delta Force.
[00:46:51.335 --> 00:46:54.458]  Man, that's a good movie.
[00:46:54.598 --> 00:46:57.000]  I love Road Warrior style films.
[00:46:57.881 --> 00:47:04.768]  After my dad did the first two Delta Forces, the film company, Canon, wanted to do... There's a little more life in this.
[00:47:04.808 --> 00:47:05.349]  Let's go do it.
[00:47:05.909 --> 00:47:06.790]  So I got a phone call.
[00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:10.314]  Well, we want to make these Delta Force movies, but we don't want to spend that kind of money.
[00:47:10.735 --> 00:47:13.137]  So in comes Mike Norris to do Delta Force 3 and 4.
[00:47:13.317 --> 00:47:14.559]  It was great.
[00:47:14.639 --> 00:47:15.239]  I had a great time.
[00:47:15.259 --> 00:47:15.840]  Let's pull that up.
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:17.622]  Let's pull up Mike Norris, Delta Force 3 and 4.
[00:47:17.682 --> 00:47:18.563]  Let's see you then.
[00:47:19.424 --> 00:47:22.347]  By the way, not only were you good buddies with your dad, of course, with...
[00:47:23.428 --> 00:47:26.431]  Steve McQueen, who I guess introduced your dad into movies and the rest was history.
[00:47:27.032 --> 00:47:28.434]  But your dad was the real deal.
[00:47:28.494 --> 00:47:34.640]  I mean, I remember talking to Joe Rogan, who's an accomplished UFC guy and won some national stuff in Taekwondo as well.
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:37.123]  And I was like, well, who's your idol?
[00:47:37.744 --> 00:47:38.825]  And he goes, well, I like Chuck Norris.
[00:47:39.085 --> 00:47:41.887]  And this is like, I met him like 16, 17 years ago here in Austin.
[00:47:41.907 --> 00:47:42.868]  We've been good friends since then.
[00:47:43.369 --> 00:47:43.829]  And I said, why?
[00:47:43.849 --> 00:47:45.610]  And he goes, well, he's like the American deal.
[00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:48.132]  He goes, he won all those championships for real against guys a lot bigger.
[00:47:48.393 --> 00:47:49.173]  That was all real.
[00:47:49.473 --> 00:47:51.235]  He could continue to win over and over again.
[00:47:51.255 --> 00:47:53.957]  And he goes, man, you get hurt doing that just a couple times.
[00:47:53.977 --> 00:47:55.719]  Because, you know, that was contact sport.
[00:47:55.759 --> 00:47:56.619]  Obviously, you know all about it.
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:01.283]  And the fact that then he could go on and start his own Hollywood thing from the grassroots.
[00:48:01.663 --> 00:48:04.305]  I mean, your dad was a Mavericks Maverick with the stuff he's done.
[00:48:04.325 --> 00:48:06.928]  And he's still a Mavericks Maverick with what he's going to do in the future.
[00:48:07.008 --> 00:48:08.249]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:48:08.789 --> 00:48:18.500]  You know, it's really a blessing to really have a father that, first off, he loved us.
[00:48:19.321 --> 00:48:21.724]  I forgot, Joe, just interrupt because I'm so horrible.
[00:48:21.784 --> 00:48:27.730]  I forgot, Joe said he thought your dad would have been a UFC champion if he'd have been, you know, at that age now when that was going on.
[00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:28.311]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:48:29.432 --> 00:48:30.052]  It could have been.
[00:48:30.593 --> 00:48:33.394]  My dad was smarter than any other fighter out there.
[00:48:33.514 --> 00:48:34.734]  He was not the most physical.
[00:48:34.935 --> 00:48:37.056]  He was not the fastest, meanest, anything.
[00:48:37.276 --> 00:48:38.356]  But he was the smartest.
[00:48:38.676 --> 00:48:41.037]  And if he ever did get beat, it only happened once.
[00:48:41.117 --> 00:48:43.999]  Because he would learn his lesson, come back, and beat that opponent.
[00:48:44.019 --> 00:48:45.279]  Sure, but you said your dad loved you uninterrupted.
[00:48:45.399 --> 00:48:46.600]  Yeah, no, you know what?
[00:48:47.941 --> 00:48:53.486]  My dad, during high school, he wouldn't make movies during football season.
[00:48:53.626 --> 00:48:56.329]  He'd come to every football game, every Friday night light.
[00:48:57.770 --> 00:49:01.293]  So he scheduled his life around his kids.
[00:49:01.974 --> 00:49:10.482]  And I hope he still sees it like that, because he's got two younger kids now with Gina, and they're 14, 15 years old.
[00:49:13.945 --> 00:49:17.346]  It's important that my dad knows that this isn't his second chance.
[00:49:17.446 --> 00:49:21.289]  He did great the first time, and he's going to do great again with his new kids.
[00:49:21.629 --> 00:49:30.414]  But it was so special to be able to see his fame get a little higher, and he'd still show up at all the football games.
[00:49:30.454 --> 00:49:33.575]  I'd run up and give him a kiss after every game, him and my mother.
[00:49:33.956 --> 00:49:36.337]  So it was all very normal.
[00:49:36.497 --> 00:49:37.458]  It was all very normal.
[00:49:37.498 --> 00:49:38.838]  Chuck Norris is pure Americana.
[00:49:39.299 --> 00:49:39.839]  Absolutely.
[00:49:40.199 --> 00:49:40.739]  Absolutely.
[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:45.663]  100%.
[00:49:44.342 --> 00:49:45.663]  Well, it's amazing.
[00:49:45.703 --> 00:49:46.944]  The film is Amerageddon.
[00:49:47.385 --> 00:49:49.106]  You guys are 100% Americana.
[00:49:49.787 --> 00:49:55.752]  I just want to congratulate you and Gary Haven and everybody else because this is better than I thought it'd be.
[00:49:56.172 --> 00:49:57.153]  I mean, it really is good.
[00:49:57.974 --> 00:49:59.275]  I got a chance to see the film last week.
[00:50:00.036 --> 00:50:04.820]  I hope we can come back down before the film opens in March to bring Gary down here.
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:05.400]  Like I said,
[00:50:06.081 --> 00:50:20.069]  Gary, the man of mystery, is off doing something mysterious, but he is very passionate, very well-read on everything going on, and where I'm always trying to play catch-up with him.
[00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:21.991]  So, I'm excited.
[00:50:22.051 --> 00:50:27.814]  I just really encourage everybody to go to the Ameriget and Facebook page, Ameriget and the film website.
[00:50:27.834 --> 00:50:28.595]  You know what's weird?
[00:50:28.995 --> 00:50:29.875]  You just launched it today.
[00:50:29.895 --> 00:50:31.056]  It was like 100, 500, 800.
[00:50:31.156 --> 00:50:32.237]  It just went back down to 400.
[00:50:32.297 --> 00:50:34.018]  I've never seen Facebook do that.
[00:50:34.038 --> 00:50:35.219]  The likes just went down on it.
[00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:37.042]  I wonder if they're jacking with that.
[00:50:37.082 --> 00:50:37.704]  I mean, they didn't...
[00:50:38.604 --> 00:50:41.226]  I mean, it certainly censors sometimes, so it's going up and down.
[00:50:41.586 --> 00:50:43.527]  We need this to have hundreds of thousands by next week.
[00:50:43.547 --> 00:50:44.488]  I know the trailer will.
[00:50:44.788 --> 00:50:48.170]  Exclusively at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:48.811]  See the trailer.
[00:50:48.831 --> 00:50:52.053]  And there's another trailer coming out that yours truly, Pumpkinhead, is in.
[00:50:52.753 --> 00:50:53.374]  So, great job.
[00:50:53.414 --> 00:50:53.994]  Mike, come back.
[00:50:54.014 --> 00:50:55.335]  I got a few other questions for you.
[00:50:55.555 --> 00:51:02.040]  And then we're gonna hand the baton to David Knight, who is actually in the trailer, promoting the film.
[00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:03.100]  He's kind of like the narrator.
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:08.164]  Just like in Blade Runner, they've got the old cop talking about, well, what was happening at that time.
[00:51:08.565 --> 00:51:08.851]  Yeah.
[00:51:09.947 --> 00:51:14.530]  A revolution in body protection has arrived only at FortressSurvivalLLC.com.

[00:53:09.065 --> 00:53:12.547]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:53:13.287 --> 00:53:13.808]  It's true.
[00:53:13.908 --> 00:53:17.850]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:19.911]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:53:20.451 --> 00:53:24.934]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[00:54:17.259 --> 00:54:20.060]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:54:20.181 --> 00:54:24.643]  Speaking of Mission Impossible, we're doing five minutes to the next hour, then handing the baton to David Knight.
[00:54:24.983 --> 00:54:27.205]  I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:54:27.545 --> 00:54:29.847]  I'll be hosting the Sunday transmission live.
[00:54:30.267 --> 00:54:32.928]  And then right into next week, right into 2016.
[00:54:33.169 --> 00:54:35.030]  This is not a setup.
[00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:41.314]  I said, hey, we're gonna come back in this segment, do five more minutes to the next hour, and then no man's land, and then, you know, hand it over to David Knight.
[00:54:42.054 --> 00:54:46.257]  I'm going to do about a 60 second plug here in a minute for products, free shipping up until December.
[00:54:46.277 --> 00:54:47.658]  And you went, oh yeah, oh yeah!
[00:54:47.678 --> 00:54:49.480]  Let me tell you how much weight I lost.
[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.601]  So just repeat for folks, this is not a setup.
[00:54:51.761 --> 00:54:51.921]  No.
[00:54:52.502 --> 00:54:59.187]  Please, because I know I gave you a bunch of this a year ago, please repeat for the audience out there what Supermail and other products did for you, Mike Norris.
[00:54:59.487 --> 00:55:00.488]  Well, you know what?
[00:55:00.688 --> 00:55:05.392]  I have lost 50 pounds using these supplements from Alex and Info.
[00:55:06.152 --> 00:55:06.893]  I don't know what happened.
[00:55:06.913 --> 00:55:10.279]  I was 232 when we did the film.
[00:55:10.399 --> 00:55:12.101]  I was 232 pounds.
[00:55:12.642 --> 00:55:13.924]  I was a horrible mess.
[00:55:14.004 --> 00:55:15.306]  Well, you're in fighting weight right now.
[00:55:15.447 --> 00:55:15.887]  But really?
[00:55:15.907 --> 00:55:16.668]  You really the product?
[00:55:16.688 --> 00:55:17.470]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:18.551]  You gave me a whole box of these.
[00:55:19.232 --> 00:55:19.373]  Hey.
[00:55:20.876 --> 00:55:21.717]  Male vitality?
[00:55:22.037 --> 00:55:22.738]  Where's my camera?
[00:55:23.158 --> 00:55:23.519]  Get it.
[00:55:24.419 --> 00:55:24.780]  Brain?
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:25.801]  The brain?
[00:55:26.101 --> 00:55:29.564]  I'm telling you, everybody, this stuff is amazing.
[00:55:29.664 --> 00:55:30.045]  I use it.
[00:55:30.125 --> 00:55:31.506]  I've lost 50 pounds.
[00:55:31.826 --> 00:55:32.447]  I feel great.
[00:55:32.667 --> 00:55:34.809]  I feel better than I've ever felt in my life.
[00:55:35.069 --> 00:55:36.231]  This is not a joke.
[00:55:36.631 --> 00:55:38.052]  Please support this.
[00:55:38.292 --> 00:55:39.073]  It's awesome.
[00:55:39.273 --> 00:55:39.734]  Well, thank you.
[00:55:39.794 --> 00:55:41.315]  I mean, I went to the top chemist.
[00:55:42.276 --> 00:55:42.516]  We have
[00:55:43.157 --> 00:55:49.279]  Two of the biggest non-GMO laboratories in the country that are like, you know, they make most of the stuff from whole foods, you name it.
[00:55:49.619 --> 00:55:56.422]  And I said, what would your scientists want to be just over the top if people really wanted to have, you know, half the cost of the bottle be the product?
[00:55:56.862 --> 00:55:58.762]  And we would do this, we would do that, we would do this, we would do that.
[00:55:58.802 --> 00:56:00.143]  And Group makes most of our products as well.
[00:56:00.503 --> 00:56:02.844]  That's what kind of, you know, sets up the whole vetting process.
[00:56:04.064 --> 00:56:07.586]  We'll have a product that's $40, and $20 of it's the product.
[00:56:07.606 --> 00:56:08.627]  That's still a big markup.
[00:56:08.927 --> 00:56:10.808]  The average markup of supplements is seven times.
[00:56:11.168 --> 00:56:16.832]  They will not put the quality in it, and that's why this stuff... I mean, I want stuff that will knock your socks off.
[00:56:17.712 --> 00:56:21.314]  And I'm telling you, Infowarslife.com, Supermail isn't a game, though.
[00:56:22.535 --> 00:56:25.896]  Oh, this is great, then drink a quarter bottle, and then do not do it, folks.
[00:56:26.276 --> 00:56:27.816]  I mean, believe me, it's not a game.
[00:56:28.176 --> 00:56:36.498]  Infowarslife.com, free shipping until December 18th, 33% off the essentials pack, a bunch of other specials as well, infowarslife.com.
[00:56:36.939 --> 00:56:38.599]  What did you notice when you started taking the super meal?
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:43.560]  Well, it's a family show, I guess.
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:45.121]  I feel really good.
[00:56:45.241 --> 00:56:46.301]  My wife's very happy.
[00:56:49.679 --> 00:56:50.140]  Sorry, honey.
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:56.247]  I got a high-powered lawyer who one of his best friends is like a top herbologist and he just wanted to see if I was full of baloney.
[00:56:56.267 --> 00:56:56.928]  I've known him for years.
[00:56:56.948 --> 00:56:58.770]  He brought him to me and went, man, this is really great stuff.
[00:56:59.191 --> 00:57:01.133]  Oh, Dr. Grimson-Volvo, that's like the best guy.
[00:57:01.614 --> 00:57:07.041]  Well, you know, everybody's now getting testosterone shots, having to take this or that right here.
[00:57:07.381 --> 00:57:07.682]  One stop.
[00:57:09.625 --> 00:57:12.348]  It's the real deal, and it's from Mother Nature, the good old Lord above.
[00:57:12.708 --> 00:57:13.789]  All right, we're going to break here.
[00:57:14.289 --> 00:57:19.594]  You've been talking about Trump, and so if you want to repeat any of that on air, I mean, what do you think about Trump?
[00:57:19.614 --> 00:57:20.535]  What's Papa think about him?
[00:57:20.755 --> 00:57:21.056]  Okay.
[00:57:22.677 --> 00:57:24.799]  You know, my dad loves Trump.
[00:57:26.961 --> 00:57:29.303]  There may be some issues with facial expressions.
[00:57:29.563 --> 00:57:29.964]  I don't know.
[00:57:32.412 --> 00:57:40.280]  Look, there's nothing wrong with the American people wanting our leader to make us feel better, make us feel safe.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.023]  I'm safe, you're safe, your listeners.
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:48.462]  Are I'm sure probably pretty safe because they're armed, they're ready.
[00:57:49.183 --> 00:57:55.206]  But the average Joe wants a leader that's going to make them feel secure living in this country.
[00:57:56.007 --> 00:57:57.067]  It's like Ronald Reagan.
[00:57:57.367 --> 00:57:58.848]  It's like Ronald Reagan in 1981.
[00:57:58.928 --> 00:58:02.611]  I remember it was the first time I ever got to vote for president.
[00:58:02.731 --> 00:58:04.612]  I was in high school and I voted for Ronald Reagan.
[00:58:04.852 --> 00:58:05.552]  I remember this.
[00:58:05.693 --> 00:58:11.356]  Jimmy Carter, we had hostages in Iran and Ronald Reagan says the economy was in the toilet.
[00:58:11.496 --> 00:58:13.298]  Well, that's what we need is
[00:58:31.528 --> 00:58:39.253]  A national symbol, or somebody to tell us that we can be great again, and to get past this socialist idea that we're all pathetic, cloward and pivot.
[00:58:39.293 --> 00:58:40.754]  They don't want us to feel great again.
[00:58:40.814 --> 00:58:41.974]  Women feel great, men feel great.
[00:58:42.295 --> 00:58:42.735]  Stay there.
[00:58:42.775 --> 00:58:46.857]  Another segment with Mike Norris, 70 seconds away on the fourth hour.
[00:58:47.158 --> 00:58:48.758]  Infowars.com forward slash show.

[00:58:58.284 --> 00:58:58.865]  And we know you will.
[00:58:59.810 --> 00:59:02.813]  Christmas would have come and gone, and with it, 2015.

[00:59:56.315 --> 00:59:58.297]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.123]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:11.135 --> 01:00:12.596]  We are on the march.
[01:00:12.956 --> 01:00:15.358]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:00:16.099 --> 01:00:19.841]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:25.705 --> 01:00:37.214]  And I recognize that a great many folks in the media would prefer that anyone running for president engage in an ongoing, as an ongoing theater critic,
[01:00:38.487 --> 01:00:40.088]  Criticizing the proposals of others.
[01:00:40.188 --> 01:00:42.170]  I do not agree with his proposal.
[01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:44.251]  I do not think it is the right solution.
[01:00:44.771 --> 01:00:48.634]  And the right solution, I believe, is the legislation that I've introduced.
[01:00:49.194 --> 01:00:59.942]  Legislation that would impose a three-year moratorium on the refugees coming from countries where ISIS or Al-Qaeda control a substantial amount of territory.
[01:01:01.583 --> 01:01:04.265]  This is legislation that is targeted directly to the problem.
[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:07.601]  And the reason is simple.
[01:01:07.681 --> 01:01:10.864]  We have been told by the FBI they cannot vet these refugees.
[01:01:11.465 --> 01:01:23.275]  The second piece of legislation Governor Abbott mentioned is legislation that I filed today that will protect the authority of the states and the authority of governors to keep their citizens safe.
[01:01:24.837 --> 01:01:31.403]  And it would say that in the event the president wants to send refugees to a particular state that a governor has the ability to opt out.
[01:01:33.021 --> 01:01:41.551]  To conclude that the federal government has not done a sufficient job ensuring that the safety and security of the citizens of a state will be protected.
[01:01:42.232 --> 01:01:49.461]  And then the third piece of legislation that I have tried to bring up in recent weeks and the Democrats have blocked is the Expatriate Terrorist Act.
[01:01:50.738 --> 01:02:01.109]  Which provides that if an American goes and travels abroad and joins ISIS, and takes up arms and wages jihad against the United States, that he or she forfeits their U.S.
[01:02:01.149 --> 01:02:01.530]  citizenship.
[01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:02.391]  That's a good idea.
[01:02:02.771 --> 01:02:05.294]  All of these are reasonable, common-sense steps.
[01:02:05.874 --> 01:02:06.075]  Yep.
[01:02:06.795 --> 01:02:07.696]  To keep America safe.
[01:02:09.315 --> 01:02:11.438]  That's Senator Ted Cruz, very presidential.
[01:02:11.518 --> 01:02:16.865]  I mean, he probably is the smartest of all the candidates on the Republican side, other than Trump when it comes to business.
[01:02:17.586 --> 01:02:20.550]  And Trump knows people like stuff said kind of at a street level.
[01:02:21.772 --> 01:02:23.253]  Trump says it's what he's got, street smarts.
[01:02:23.833 --> 01:02:30.956]  Cruz is very statesmanly, very cerebral, and what he's saying is an accurate, basic plan.
[01:02:31.296 --> 01:02:39.500]  I mean, it's the bare minimum you should do when 25% of the people in a poll say that they support suicide bombers, or they support ISIS.
[01:02:41.801 --> 01:02:47.564]  That's because they admit between 75 and 80 plus percent, depending on which numbers come out from Interpol,
[01:02:48.871 --> 01:02:51.713]  The EU, you name it, are not Syrians.
[01:02:51.773 --> 01:02:54.215]  They came to take over land.
[01:02:58.618 --> 01:03:02.620]  Just like the Saudi Arabians did one time before they came in and took over Syria and got kicked back out.
[01:03:04.021 --> 01:03:05.903]  There's a movie about it, it's called Lawrence of Arabia.
[01:03:07.504 --> 01:03:08.785]  And it's not their country.
[01:03:11.186 --> 01:03:12.107]  And they're there taking it.
[01:03:13.848 --> 01:03:15.249]  They never had any history up there.
[01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:16.711]  They have no reason to be there.
[01:03:17.071 --> 01:03:17.612]  They're there.
[01:03:17.972 --> 01:03:22.977]  And then now, they're going to come here, and they are incompatible to live anywhere.
[01:03:23.097 --> 01:03:25.980]  I mean, Saudi Arabia is a freak zone of craziness.
[01:03:26.581 --> 01:03:33.788]  From all the military and family I've talked to that have worked for different companies, but over there, I mean, they catch you with a Bible on the street, folks, you're going to be in prison for life.
[01:03:34.469 --> 01:03:35.911]  Lucky they don't chop your head off.
[01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:40.196]  And all they do is peck at each other to make the others more radical.
[01:03:40.856 --> 01:03:41.677]  That's what cults do.
[01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:44.980]  They just get more and more extreme, more and more whacked out, more and more weird.
[01:03:47.322 --> 01:03:49.904]  And I for one am completely sick of it.
[01:03:49.924 --> 01:03:51.245]  I do not have Islamophobia.
[01:03:51.265 --> 01:03:55.308]  I have Wahhabist Saudi Arabia phobia.
[01:03:55.908 --> 01:03:57.490]  I have cult phobia.
[01:03:59.022 --> 01:04:10.193]  And who's the other group acts like a cult that I can see that I am just as disgusted by because they are so freakish, they are so weird, and they're teamed up with the jihadis, with the Wahhabist jihadis.
[01:04:12.595 --> 01:04:15.778]  And that is the politically correct left.
[01:04:18.649 --> 01:04:44.884]  That you cannot make up how serious their war on words, their war on logic, their war on discussion, their war on free speech, their war on creativity, their war on beauty, their war on arithmetic, their war on literature, their war on culture, their war on common sense, their war on logic, their war on beauty, their war on men, their war on women, their war on basic human systems.
[01:04:46.045 --> 01:04:51.507]  Students at Pennsylvania College want Lynch Hall renamed because of the word lynch.
[01:04:53.027 --> 01:04:55.168]  I'm going to cover this and take your phone calls when we come back.
[01:04:56.028 --> 01:05:04.671]  Folks, they know exactly what they're doing when they say ban the Irish word lynch that has nothing to do with hanging black people.
[01:05:09.557 --> 01:05:15.044]  Well, it looks like the Justice Department wants to ban more Americans from owning guns.
[01:05:15.325 --> 01:05:26.640]  That's right, President Barack Hussein Obama is proposing new firearm regulations that will revoke gun rights from those the government declares to be mentally unfit.
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:42.138]  And that's a scary thought considering the fact that the official diagnostic system for mental disorders in the US, the DSM-5, is so broad that almost every form of human behavior can be diagnosed as some type of mental illness.
[01:05:42.498 --> 01:05:47.643]  For example, in 2012, the Department of Veteran Affairs sent out letters to U.S.
[01:05:47.703 --> 01:05:52.768]  military veterans to inform them that their competence levels were under review.
[01:05:53.128 --> 01:06:02.136]  If the federal government rated them incompetent, they would be prohibited from purchasing, possessing, receiving, or transporting a firearm, or even ammo.

[01:08:44.533 --> 01:08:45.794]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:08:47.438 --> 01:08:50.539]  We also, of course, have InfoWars and Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central.
[01:08:50.839 --> 01:08:53.440]  Find details at InfoWarsNews.com.
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:53.800]  Okay.
[01:08:54.841 --> 01:08:59.142]  We've got loaded phone lines, Tony, Isaiah, Cliff, Kevin, Dan, and many others.
[01:08:59.663 --> 01:09:03.184]  The toll-free number to join me, if you're a first-time caller, we've got the phones open, 800-259-9231.
[01:09:03.204 --> 01:09:03.244]  800-259-9231.
[01:09:11.987 --> 01:09:25.361]  We have Roger Stone, advisor to nine presidents, and who's been involved in elections here and all over the world, and one of Trump's top advisors joining us for an hour and a half to talk all things Planet Trump and election 2016.
[01:09:26.001 --> 01:09:32.348]  And Leanne McAdoo will be hosting the fourth hour today.
[01:09:33.905 --> 01:09:47.193]  Now, we've had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, we've had Senator Lindsey Graham, we've had countless other Republican candidates, Jeb Bush, people like Rick Ross, the fake Rick Ross, come out.
[01:09:48.314 --> 01:09:51.616]  And, well, Rick Ross had killed Donald Trump, so he wants him to be murdered.
[01:09:52.736 --> 01:10:03.343]  And Kareem Abdul-Jabbar claims that he's helping ISIS, he's the ISIS candidate, when he actually called for bombing their oil that they're trying to sell, and actually agreed with Putin and others, something the other candidates didn't do.
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:10.003]  So Donald Trump is right on about, like I said, about 95% of his views and topics.
[01:10:10.043 --> 01:10:14.586]  I disagree with him on a few things like the internet and, you know, restricting it so ISIS doesn't get it.
[01:10:14.606 --> 01:10:15.446]  You just can't do that.
[01:10:16.107 --> 01:10:33.798]  So there are some problems with Trump, but compared to a Hillary Clinton or compared to a Lindsey Graham or compared to a socialist senator from Connecticut, it is complete and total absolute night and day.
[01:10:35.285 --> 01:10:42.947]  And before we go to the calls, though, the problem we're dealing with, as the Pew Research shows, the middle class is disappearing at the fastest rate ever.
[01:10:43.847 --> 01:10:47.748]  The workforce is set to shrink two million people.
[01:10:48.828 --> 01:10:56.130]  The Congressional Budget Office is saying just from the first year of full implementation of Obamacare, we're only 21 days out from that nightmare.
[01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:57.930]  The fines, all the rest of it.
[01:10:58.270 --> 01:11:00.431]  Morgan Stanley begins layoffs in credit division.
[01:11:02.890 --> 01:11:07.413]  While all this is going on, the FBI admits they're not vetting any of these refugees.
[01:11:07.613 --> 01:11:09.554]  A large portion admit they want to be terrorists.
[01:11:09.774 --> 01:11:12.696]  They're attacking Europe on a basically weekly basis.
[01:11:13.036 --> 01:11:13.877]  We're getting attacked.
[01:11:14.117 --> 01:11:21.201]  They try to say all these attacks aren't attacks, whether it's Fort Hood or what happened last Wednesday, eight days ago.
[01:11:22.922 --> 01:11:28.486]  And in the midst of this though, they want Thomas Jefferson statues taken down all over the country.
[01:11:29.366 --> 01:11:32.927]  Because he tried to ban slavery in the Declaration of Independence, but it was removed.
[01:11:33.468 --> 01:11:34.488]  That's how ignorant they are.
[01:11:34.508 --> 01:11:43.092]  And they go, but he had slaves that he was trying to change the law to free the time he was in.
[01:11:43.172 --> 01:11:46.493]  It's like saying, Schindler went along with the Nazis.
[01:11:46.533 --> 01:11:50.014]  Yeah, as he tried to save Jews, he had to or they'd kill him right there on the spot.
[01:11:50.475 --> 01:11:53.596]  I mean, there's just no understanding of the time people are in.
[01:11:55.991 --> 01:12:09.981]  But you see things like Seattle where the official city, not some idiot students, but the official city says don't bring brown bags to any city function and don't say that a city function brown bag it.
[01:12:10.987 --> 01:12:14.808]  Because Brown, saying the word Brown might hurt somebody's feeling or seeing Brown.
[01:12:15.088 --> 01:12:17.049]  Now, they admitted no one ever claimed it was racist.
[01:12:17.129 --> 01:12:17.329]  No, no.
[01:12:17.609 --> 01:12:30.654]  They have to attach racial meaning or religious bigotry or something, infighting, to all words in all language so when they want to, they can selectively demonize your speech and disqualify.
[01:12:33.095 --> 01:12:34.375]  It's a war on words.
[01:12:34.395 --> 01:12:39.397]  You know, George Orwell said, Eric Blair, writer for the BBC, propagandist for British intelligence,
[01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:42.212]  Winston Smith is an allegory of himself.
[01:12:42.252 --> 01:12:43.232]  He admitted that before he died.
[01:12:43.452 --> 01:12:45.134]  He died a year after he published, 1984.
[01:12:47.496 --> 01:12:57.643]  But in 1949, it's 1948 reverse, ladies and gentlemen, of what it would be if the Fabian socialist liberals took over, what the world would look like.
[01:12:57.984 --> 01:12:59.665]  And you notice it's looking more and more like that.
[01:13:00.806 --> 01:13:02.547]  Because he was in there amongst them.
[01:13:03.388 --> 01:13:04.709]  And he wrote essays admitting it.
[01:13:06.872 --> 01:13:08.233]  He didn't like radical right-wingers.
[01:13:08.273 --> 01:13:09.474]  He'd been a leftist his whole life.
[01:13:10.075 --> 01:13:12.797]  Fought in the Spanish Civil War.
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.042]  Been a member of the secret police before that in India.
[01:13:18.062 --> 01:13:21.025]  That's what made him a leftist, was the abuse of Indians in India.
[01:13:22.919 --> 01:13:23.799]  But I digress.
[01:13:24.159 --> 01:13:39.602]  He said the goal will be by the Fabian Socialists to reduce language down to such a level that you cannot communicate with someone and have them even understand how they've been lied to and they'll have double think where they hold two opposite thoughts in their mind at the same time and believe each one as valid as the other.
[01:13:43.143 --> 01:13:46.243]  That's what they're indoctrinating us with is like this mental illness.
[01:13:47.984 --> 01:13:49.484]  This mass Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:13:51.050 --> 01:14:00.376]  And so, sitting back, looking at all of this, they have to expand it out always more and more.
[01:14:00.756 --> 01:14:06.539]  So the real racism of targeting blacks with Planned Parenthood isn't looked at, or targeting Hispanics with Gardasil shots isn't looked at.
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:12.163]  No, no, you've just got to then say, well, if you don't have totally open borders and pay for everything free, you're a racist.
[01:14:14.213 --> 01:14:19.216]  Or, if Donald Trump goes to a Jewish group and says, you know, Jews are really known for being smart, hardworking folks.
[01:14:19.596 --> 01:14:20.897]  It's good to be here with such good people.
[01:14:21.217 --> 01:14:25.240]  Oh, it's racist to attribute something to a racial or religious group.
[01:14:26.821 --> 01:14:28.222]  No, everybody said, look at the Japanese.
[01:14:28.462 --> 01:14:30.163]  Crime went down during the tsunami.
[01:14:30.743 --> 01:14:31.664]  And during the earthquakes.
[01:14:32.664 --> 01:14:33.525]  When things got tough.
[01:14:33.705 --> 01:14:34.445]  Almost no crime.
[01:14:34.686 --> 01:14:35.666]  Wow, what amazing people.
[01:14:35.866 --> 01:14:37.047]  That's not anti-Japanese.
[01:14:39.528 --> 01:14:41.650]  See, they're attacking your ability
[01:14:42.827 --> 01:14:43.467]  To discriminate.
[01:14:44.188 --> 01:14:47.730]  See, some discrimination is obviously wrong if it's based not on real issues.
[01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:57.917]  But if it's based on, I've been to that restaurant twice and got food poisoning both times, it's not racist or discriminatory or whatever to discriminate and say, I like the hamburgers at that place.
[01:14:58.357 --> 01:14:59.298]  I like this ketchup.
[01:14:59.538 --> 01:15:00.639]  I like this brand of car.
[01:15:00.979 --> 01:15:03.521]  I like women that look like this and act like this.
[01:15:03.761 --> 01:15:04.782]  It's what you like.
[01:15:05.042 --> 01:15:09.885]  They're saying you can't have your own opinions or be a free, conscious individual.
[01:15:10.165 --> 01:15:11.826]  That is cult-like, isn't it?
[01:15:12.087 --> 01:15:12.547]  By design.
[01:15:14.007 --> 01:15:17.488]  So now students at Pennsylvania School want Lynch Hall.
[01:15:17.508 --> 01:15:19.428]  This is Associated Press.
[01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:20.929]  This isn't Infowars.com.
[01:15:22.269 --> 01:15:27.770]  Students at Pennsylvania School want Lynch Hall renamed because the word Lynch.
[01:15:29.811 --> 01:15:30.951]  Now I went and looked it up.
[01:15:32.151 --> 01:15:36.492]  Lynch means mariner or water in the Irish Gaelic.
[01:15:37.813 --> 01:15:40.255]  And it basically means the same thing in the Nordic Lynch.
[01:15:40.295 --> 01:15:43.777]  There's also a Nordic Lynch, because all the groups are really related to each other.
[01:15:44.278 --> 01:15:48.120]  Which shows how stupid it is the British Empire could play different groups off against each other.
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:50.762]  It's totally moronic, but another side issue.
[01:15:51.263 --> 01:15:52.864]  Divide and Conquer, they call it the great game.
[01:15:54.205 --> 01:15:56.166]  This is from Ancestry.com.
[01:15:56.987 --> 01:15:58.247]  Irish Lynch.
[01:15:59.108 --> 01:16:00.629]  Anglicized from Gaelic.
[01:16:02.210 --> 01:16:07.274]  Longishine, a personal name meaning Mariner from Longship, or Viking basically.
[01:16:08.749 --> 01:16:09.129]  Okay.
[01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:11.431]  Men in longboats.
[01:16:12.652 --> 01:16:13.532]  Let's continue.
[01:16:14.012 --> 01:16:14.993]  That shuttled Ireland.
[01:16:17.795 --> 01:16:18.695]  The etymology.
[01:16:18.895 --> 01:16:21.077]  This is from the encyclopedia.
[01:16:23.186 --> 01:16:27.048]  The origins of the word lynch are obscure, but likely originate from the American Revolution.
[01:16:27.329 --> 01:16:34.673]  The term originates from the phrase lynch law, passed to stop people lynching, punishment without trial.
[01:16:34.933 --> 01:16:37.295]  So see, the word lynch is good, meaning stop doing it.
[01:16:37.735 --> 01:16:44.779]  Two Americans during this era are generally credited with the phrase, Charles Lynch and William Lynch, both of whom lived in Virginia in the 1870s and 1880s.
[01:16:44.799 --> 01:16:47.741]  I'm trying to go too fast here because I want to go to calls.
[01:16:47.801 --> 01:16:48.962]  I'm going to slow down and cover this.
[01:16:53.527 --> 01:16:55.789]  And then it just goes over the fact that it was a case of lynching.
[01:16:58.451 --> 01:16:59.852]  And by the way, none of a black person.
[01:17:00.132 --> 01:17:01.793]  But this is how emotional it is.
[01:17:02.293 --> 01:17:19.046]  You hear a Nordic or an Irish Gaelic name that means mariner or boatman, and then you want it banned because all you know is the word lynch is associated with hanging black people when really it was two white men hanging a member of their family who were named Lynch.
[01:17:21.604 --> 01:17:32.222]  But see, for them it's a power thing to take language away, to take people's rights away, to have a name, to demand history be overwritten.
[01:17:32.522 --> 01:17:33.945]  This is the essence of 1984, changing history.
[01:17:37.802 --> 01:17:40.564]  I mean, so what if it was a racist weirdo that founded your college?
[01:17:40.804 --> 01:17:41.565]  You run it now.
[01:17:41.805 --> 01:17:42.766]  It's run by your people.
[01:17:42.826 --> 01:17:43.486]  It's a building.
[01:17:43.727 --> 01:17:44.427]  It's a colony.
[01:17:44.707 --> 01:17:45.368]  It's a system.
[01:17:45.528 --> 01:17:46.549]  It's where you're supposed to learn.
[01:17:46.809 --> 01:17:50.252]  You learn how to infight, not how to get a job, not how to be normal.
[01:17:50.892 --> 01:17:56.397]  It'd be like saying if a moray eel had lived in a hole in coral 20 years before,
[01:17:57.097 --> 01:17:58.599]  And now a grouper lives in it.
[01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:01.924]  Does the grouper say moray eels eat baby groupers?
[01:18:02.164 --> 01:18:03.606]  So this was a racist hole?
[01:18:03.626 --> 01:18:10.155]  So I'm not going to live in this amore eels hole because he doesn't even care that an amore eel lived there 20 years before.
[01:18:10.335 --> 01:18:11.256]  He doesn't even know it.
[01:18:11.317 --> 01:18:12.058]  It's a good hole.
[01:18:14.535 --> 01:18:15.275]  Oh, change it!
[01:18:15.415 --> 01:18:16.496]  But it wasn't a racist.
[01:18:16.796 --> 01:18:18.276]  It wasn't named after a lynch mom.
[01:18:18.496 --> 01:18:19.997]  It was named after somebody named Lynch.
[01:18:20.337 --> 01:18:23.718]  And they say, well, the word Lynch could draw up frightening connotations.
[01:18:23.978 --> 01:18:26.678]  We're scared by the word, so get rid of it.
[01:18:27.279 --> 01:18:28.619]  I mean, you talk about idiots.
[01:18:29.039 --> 01:18:32.180]  Instead of the fun, if somebody said this, I'm going and looking it up.
[01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:33.560]  Oh, it means boatman.
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:34.340]  It means sailor.
[01:18:34.621 --> 01:18:36.961]  It means somebody in a navy.
[01:18:39.442 --> 01:18:43.363]  Students at a small Pennsylvania college are demanding, and they're doing a walkout.
[01:18:44.406 --> 01:18:51.368]  And laying on the sidewalk, the administrators rename a building called Lynch Memorial Hall because of the racial overturns of the word Lynch.
[01:18:51.748 --> 01:18:53.848]  Oh, there's overtones in Brown Bag, too.
[01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:59.190]  The building is named after Clyde A. Lynch, who was president of Lebanon Valley College until 1950.
[01:18:59.290 --> 01:19:07.492]  And they said they want it renamed after his first name and middle initial because the word
[01:19:09.588 --> 01:19:13.639]  Recalls the public executions of black men by white mobs in the 18 and 1900s.
[01:19:16.274 --> 01:19:19.295]  It was included on a list of demands that students presented to the school on Friday.
[01:19:19.775 --> 01:19:39.018]  I mean, you talk about a group of ignorant morons, and by the way, have any of their professors dared educate them and say, hey, it's an Irish name, it's a Nordic name, it has nothing to do with any of this, it means sailor, this guy is just Irish, you know, he helped get this building built, he gave the money for it so you can be in it.
[01:19:39.278 --> 01:19:40.258]  They just go, no!
[01:19:40.798 --> 01:19:42.619]  With the lynch words scares us!
[01:19:42.719 --> 01:19:43.659]  We want it banned!
[01:19:47.443 --> 01:19:48.003]  Think about that.
[01:19:49.224 --> 01:19:51.265]  These people aren't going to be able to get jobs or have a life.
[01:19:51.305 --> 01:19:55.427]  They are going to be gibbering, mentally ill people when they come out of college.
[01:19:55.447 --> 01:19:56.327]  The ones that buy into this.
[01:19:56.607 --> 01:20:07.072]  That just know how to see shadows and phantoms everywhere while their basic freedoms are being removed collectively regardless of race, color, creed, religion against them all.
[01:20:09.631 --> 01:20:11.112]  Are you looking to sell body armor?

[01:22:09.319 --> 01:22:19.927]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?

[01:22:32.176 --> 01:22:41.961]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[01:22:42.202 --> 01:22:48.445]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[01:22:48.705 --> 01:22:52.007]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[01:22:52.027 --> 01:22:53.848]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[01:22:54.108 --> 01:22:57.210]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[01:22:57.310 --> 01:22:57.710]  I think so.
[01:23:17.461 --> 01:23:18.182]  We're good to go!

[01:24:31.471 --> 01:24:33.832]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[01:24:33.852 --> 01:24:35.632]  But you got Donald Trump to blame.
[01:24:36.253 --> 01:24:38.073]  You got someone to blame.
[01:24:38.173 --> 01:24:41.314]  That's right, they say he is behind ISIS.
[01:24:41.334 --> 01:24:42.455]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[01:24:42.475 --> 01:24:44.796]  That's the new talking point by the Republicans, the Democrats.
[01:24:45.456 --> 01:24:45.816]  All of them.
[01:24:45.876 --> 01:24:46.616]  Hillary Clinton.
[01:24:48.677 --> 01:24:49.437]  That creature.
[01:24:50.058 --> 01:24:50.678]  Lindsey Graham.
[01:24:52.003 --> 01:24:52.623]  John McCain?
[01:24:54.324 --> 01:24:59.226]  They're all out there saying that Donald Trump is helping ISIS and then giving no intellectual facts.
[01:25:00.866 --> 01:25:02.907]  No, Donald Trump's trying to keep ISIS out of this country.
[01:25:03.968 --> 01:25:16.112]  And when there's more terror attacks, and Donald Trump points out it's another person got into this country on a phony visa, with phony info, will he get rewarded with people's support?
[01:25:16.172 --> 01:25:16.772]  Probably not.
[01:25:18.233 --> 01:25:20.254]  Because the ones that already support him know what's going on.
[01:25:20.314 --> 01:25:21.014]  The ones that don't,
[01:25:22.110 --> 01:25:25.373]  They don't care how much evidence there is, how much common sense there is.
[01:25:25.753 --> 01:25:38.284]  They're the kind of people that want to change the name of Lynch Hall at a college because the last guy's name is Lynch, and they associate that with someone being hung or killed extrajudicially.
[01:25:38.885 --> 01:25:42.928]  Meanwhile, Obama wants to lynch all gun owners extrajudicially.
[01:25:43.309 --> 01:25:44.069]  I just thought of that.
[01:25:45.123 --> 01:25:57.217]  I use fancy terms like extrajudicial, banning your flight, banning your guns, banning your travel, the blood of tyranny, the oxygen of tyranny, the atmosphere on which its wings flap.
[01:25:59.596 --> 01:26:02.919]  Oh, we're gonna just put you on a no-fly list for no reason, and then you can't have a gun!
[01:26:02.979 --> 01:26:03.900]  A no-gun list!
[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:07.022]  A lynch mob on the Second Amendment.
[01:26:07.042 --> 01:26:07.562]  That's what it is.
[01:26:07.843 --> 01:26:12.206]  An extrajudicial magic lynch mob in the unelected government.
[01:26:12.726 --> 01:26:18.311]  Like the NDAA says they'll grab you, they'll interrogate you, they'll torture you, they'll kill you, even U.S.
[01:26:18.351 --> 01:26:25.156]  citizens, and you don't have a right to even tell your family they have you before they kill you, and they can use torture against you.
[01:26:25.496 --> 01:26:26.337]  A classic
[01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:32.358]  Torture lynch mob, but because there's a real lynching going on, no one seems to care!
[01:26:32.598 --> 01:26:38.140]  Because the word is so scary from the name it comes from in the name of the law.
[01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:43.021]  Ignorance on top of ignorance on top of moronic idiocy.
[01:26:45.181 --> 01:26:49.402]  But you talk to these university students, I guarantee you they'll get all mad and go, Trigger!
[01:26:49.582 --> 01:26:49.862]  Trigger!
[01:26:49.882 --> 01:26:50.282]  Get back!
[01:26:50.702 --> 01:26:51.403]  You're being aggressive!
[01:26:51.423 --> 01:26:52.083]  You're being hateful!
[01:26:52.223 --> 01:26:52.583]  Get back!
[01:26:52.623 --> 01:26:52.923]  Get back!
[01:26:54.167 --> 01:26:56.608]  I ran into some weirdo lady at Target.
[01:26:56.628 --> 01:26:58.448]  I hardly ever go to big box stores, but I was going there.
[01:27:00.489 --> 01:27:04.050]  My son likes some of the sweaters they've got there, and they're cheap, whatever he likes.
[01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:05.230]  He loves the sweater.
[01:27:05.250 --> 01:27:05.911]  He wears it all the time.
[01:27:06.211 --> 01:27:06.991]  It's like 15 bucks.
[01:27:07.011 --> 01:27:08.071]  I went and bought like four more of them.
[01:27:08.331 --> 01:27:09.232]  It's like his uniform now.
[01:27:10.372 --> 01:27:11.292]  He wanted to go to Target.
[01:27:11.432 --> 01:27:11.993]  I'm in Target.
[01:27:12.013 --> 01:27:13.073]  I know we have a load of phones here.
[01:27:13.093 --> 01:27:15.454]  I'm going to go to you.
[01:27:16.554 --> 01:27:18.275]  One of my daughters wanted something, so she walked over.
[01:27:18.315 --> 01:27:18.815]  I walked with her.
[01:27:18.835 --> 01:27:19.275]  I came back.
[01:27:20.239 --> 01:27:23.422]  And a lady had pulled up and, you know, he was already there putting stuff off the cart.
[01:27:23.782 --> 01:27:25.944]  And I just squeezed through, barely even touched her cart.
[01:27:26.364 --> 01:27:27.485]  And she went, oh!
[01:27:29.047 --> 01:27:30.168]  You need to make right on this!
[01:27:30.188 --> 01:27:31.389]  You just rammed into me!
[01:27:31.429 --> 01:27:32.890]  And I said, well, excuse me, I'm sorry.
[01:27:32.930 --> 01:27:34.792]  I believe I just barely touched your cart, but I'm sorry.
[01:27:35.392 --> 01:27:36.654]  She goes, get back!
[01:27:36.694 --> 01:27:38.775]  You're a very dangerous, scary man!
[01:27:40.457 --> 01:27:42.138]  And the lady behind the counter goes, excuse me?
[01:27:42.158 --> 01:27:43.099]  She's like, what?
[01:27:43.139 --> 01:27:43.760]  What's going on, lady?
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.601]  And she's like, I feel threatened!
[01:27:45.902 --> 01:27:47.103]  She had these two sons with her.
[01:27:48.325 --> 01:27:50.786]  And I went, oh, and I kind of turned my back, and I said, it's OK, guys.
[01:27:50.866 --> 01:27:56.088]  And she starts going, yeah, I bet Mr. Celebrity on his AM radio will be talking about this.
[01:27:56.428 --> 01:27:57.568]  And I went, oh.
[01:27:57.588 --> 01:28:02.410]  And I just kept my mouth shut, got the sweaters, the socks, the underwear he wanted, got out of there.
[01:28:03.919 --> 01:28:05.861]  My daughters wanted some robes.
[01:28:05.881 --> 01:28:06.762]  We got them robes.
[01:28:07.262 --> 01:28:07.883]  Impulse buy.
[01:28:07.903 --> 01:28:09.765]  They all, you know, girls, myself included.
[01:28:10.065 --> 01:28:11.066]  Guy always wanted something.
[01:28:11.166 --> 01:28:11.987]  Mama was going to the store.
[01:28:12.007 --> 01:28:13.108]  You know, what am I getting?
[01:28:13.148 --> 01:28:18.293]  But I got in, I got out, and I just, I learned to, I was like, ooh, keep my mouth shut.
[01:28:18.333 --> 01:28:21.016]  And she was smiling and laughing for like two minutes.
[01:28:24.289 --> 01:28:25.249]  See, this is their weapon.
[01:28:25.269 --> 01:28:28.570]  It's, ah, you touch my card, I feel threatened.
[01:28:28.590 --> 01:28:31.991]  Just, you know, they got that whip of I'm in control now.
[01:28:32.391 --> 01:28:35.092]  Everything's a big university that I'm in control of.
[01:28:35.432 --> 01:28:40.394]  Well, Alex Jones is in line with me.
[01:28:40.614 --> 01:28:42.494]  I'm gonna exercise power.
[01:28:42.874 --> 01:28:44.435]  I'm gonna conquer something.
[01:28:45.649 --> 01:28:47.650]  And you know she had a federal or state job.
[01:28:48.170 --> 01:28:54.133]  You know, I bet money she's got some job where she can press her thumb down on little people all day, selectively when she wants.
[01:28:54.614 --> 01:28:57.235]  And she had that smile, that look in her eyes.
[01:28:58.536 --> 01:29:00.416]  And I looked at her sad little sons, man.
[01:29:00.436 --> 01:29:02.097]  I'm not going to say what they looked like, but boy.
[01:29:04.138 --> 01:29:05.699]  I couldn't take it after about a minute and a half.
[01:29:05.739 --> 01:29:07.780]  And I just looked at them and I said, man, I bet it's rough at home.
[01:29:08.681 --> 01:29:12.803]  And her sons, who are about ages 10 and 13, looked at me and smiled knowingly.
[01:29:14.584 --> 01:29:15.264]  I shouldn't have done it.
[01:29:17.708 --> 01:29:19.049]  You know what, so she shut up.
[01:29:19.129 --> 01:29:20.750]  When I said that, then I just pushed the card off.
[01:29:22.851 --> 01:29:26.674]  So I guess I did get the little last comment, and I wasn't going to tell that story.
[01:29:26.694 --> 01:29:27.294]  It was so sad.
[01:29:27.334 --> 01:29:28.455]  We have a big guest coming up.
[01:29:28.475 --> 01:29:31.597]  You're all on Trump, so that means you're going to talk to him in this hour.
[01:29:31.757 --> 01:29:34.679]  I was going to go to you, but I went on a rant, which is what people tune in for.
[01:29:34.719 --> 01:29:35.339]  I apologize.
[01:29:35.359 --> 01:29:36.340]  It's teleprompter free.
[01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:36.760]  It's real.
[01:29:37.521 --> 01:29:39.302]  So Tony, listening on WBCR 1470 in Tennessee, Isaiah,
[01:29:43.467 --> 01:29:49.693]  Cliff, Kevin, Dan, and others, your calls are coming up with the one, the only, Roger Stone.
[01:29:49.733 --> 01:29:58.061]  I knew who he was, but man, I tell you, once I did more research on him, advisor to nine presidents and one of Donald Trump's chief advisors, straight ahead.
[01:29:58.802 --> 01:30:01.804]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[01:32:09.733 --> 01:32:13.214]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:32:13.955 --> 01:32:14.455]  It's true.
[01:32:14.575 --> 01:32:18.496]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:32:18.716 --> 01:32:20.557]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:32:21.117 --> 01:32:25.579]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[01:33:00.358 --> 01:33:01.639]  For the love of clean water.
[01:33:19.744 --> 01:33:27.328]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.168 --> 01:33:31.830]  So a university in Pennsylvania, the Associated Press is reporting.
[01:33:31.870 --> 01:33:32.690]  What a straight face.
[01:33:34.411 --> 01:33:35.612]  The students have walked out.
[01:33:36.092 --> 01:33:46.637]  They are doing these die-ins where they lay on the ground until the library hall at Lebanon Valley College
[01:33:48.846 --> 01:33:51.290]  Removes the name Lynch Memorial Hall.
[01:33:53.553 --> 01:33:55.696]  Not because the guy was involved in lynching anybody.
[01:33:56.337 --> 01:33:58.300]  Not because Lynch is an Irish name.
[01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:01.664]  Not because it means boatman or mariner or seaman.
[01:34:03.001 --> 01:34:05.402]  No, because they're scared of the word lynch.
[01:34:06.062 --> 01:34:11.765]  And then David Knight just walked in during the break and he goes, Alex, who else is named lynch in the administration?
[01:34:12.385 --> 01:34:14.006]  And I went, the Attorney General.
[01:34:14.166 --> 01:34:15.207]  I hadn't even thought of that.
[01:34:15.587 --> 01:34:16.767]  How rich is that?
[01:34:17.628 --> 01:34:28.733]  That Obama wants to extra-judicially lynch the Second Amendment and put you on a no-gun-by list on this phantom terror database when they actually won't screen the people coming in who are terrorists.
[01:34:30.379 --> 01:34:33.260]  And then the Attorney General is named Loretta Lynch.
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:35.961]  Then we should call for her to change her name.
[01:34:36.161 --> 01:34:36.941]  I feel threatened.
[01:34:37.801 --> 01:34:38.981]  I feel upset by it.
[01:34:39.942 --> 01:34:42.222]  Maybe AP should write a real article about that.
[01:34:42.402 --> 01:34:43.143]  Alex Jones!
[01:34:43.503 --> 01:34:45.103]  Maybe we should start a White House petition!
[01:34:46.504 --> 01:34:49.144]  Get thousands to sign it that the Attorney General change her name.
[01:34:49.524 --> 01:34:52.385]  Or just be Loretta L. Because it scares me!
[01:34:53.726 --> 01:34:58.187]  They want the study hall to be renamed his first name and his second initial.
[01:34:59.295 --> 01:35:00.716]  Because it's so frightening.
[01:35:01.777 --> 01:35:02.878]  We just put it on screen, folks.
[01:35:03.118 --> 01:35:04.139]  Loretta Lynch.
[01:35:04.899 --> 01:35:07.141]  Oh my gosh, Lynch, get it off of there!
[01:35:07.321 --> 01:35:08.102]  Who put that on there?
[01:35:08.142 --> 01:35:09.723]  I'm writing you up or firing you.
[01:35:10.003 --> 01:35:12.745]  Who in the TV control room put up the word Lynch?
[01:35:13.346 --> 01:35:14.447]  It's a trigger for me.
[01:35:14.467 --> 01:35:16.568]  It's not a trigger.
[01:35:16.588 --> 01:35:23.994]  The middle class is imploding and even the Congressional Budget Office admits Obamacare is going to put two million people out of work next year.
[01:35:24.754 --> 01:35:25.695]  And there's huge fines.
[01:35:25.755 --> 01:35:27.837]  It was written by foreign insurance companies to screw us over.
[01:35:29.935 --> 01:35:30.816]  Her name is Lynch, folks.
[01:35:31.036 --> 01:35:32.977]  I'm having heart palpitations right now.
[01:35:32.997 --> 01:35:33.538]  I'm so scared.
[01:35:33.618 --> 01:35:34.859]  Please save me, Obama.
[01:35:35.879 --> 01:35:36.440]  But wait a minute.
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:37.481]  His name is Hussein.
[01:35:38.101 --> 01:35:39.082]  Saddam was scary.
[01:35:39.502 --> 01:35:40.263]  Saddam Hussein.
[01:35:40.323 --> 01:35:40.923]  Oh, wait a minute.
[01:35:41.304 --> 01:35:42.885]  I want Obama to change his name, too.
[01:35:43.285 --> 01:35:44.406]  See how I can play this game?
[01:35:44.906 --> 01:35:47.188]  I want all words banned except when I use them.
[01:35:47.268 --> 01:35:48.669]  Only I am allowed to talk.
[01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:50.410]  Talk about a cult.
[01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:51.371]  Talk about prisoners.
[01:35:51.411 --> 01:35:52.612]  Talk about brainwashing.
[01:35:52.632 --> 01:35:53.653]  Talk about political correctness.
[01:35:55.674 --> 01:35:58.977]  Joining us for the next hour and a half, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:36:00.208 --> 01:36:02.650]  It's rogerstoneofthestonezone.com.
[01:36:02.690 --> 01:36:26.489]  He's written a bunch of best-selling books for Skyhorse Publishing and others on a host of issues and he has recently been all over television for everything from Bill Maher to the Discovery Channel discussing Planet Trump that he's an expert in because he's known Trump since the 1980s and let me give you Roger Stone's bio just so you know who he is in case you don't.
[01:36:26.829 --> 01:36:27.750]  Roger Stone's a veteran of
[01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:28.330]  We're good to go.
[01:36:51.088 --> 01:36:54.392]  Now in paperback, the book has sold over 100,000 copies.
[01:36:54.452 --> 01:36:55.393]  I think it's a lot more than that.
[01:36:55.934 --> 01:37:09.448]  In August, Roger Stone resigned from Donald Trump's campaign to release his groundbreaking book, The Clinton's War on Women, which is the definitive expose of the corruption, immorality, criminal record of Bill Clinton and Hillary and Chelsea Clinton.
[01:37:10.129 --> 01:37:16.371]  Last week, Infowars had Donald Trump on the broadcast, and Donald Trump called him a patriot and a tough cookie.
[01:37:17.291 --> 01:37:19.272]  And here is what others have had to say.
[01:37:19.352 --> 01:37:27.474]  Roger Stone's next book, Jeb and the Bush Crime Family, rips the veil off the whitewash that has protected the Bush crime syndicate.
[01:37:28.054 --> 01:37:33.436]  It's a story of privilege, elitism, oil, money, assassination, sex, ambition, corruption, and power.
[01:37:33.716 --> 01:37:35.757]  And I'll tell you, if you can find his book,
[01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:39.279]  On a few online sites, and you can find it at bookstores, you better.
[01:37:39.859 --> 01:37:41.260]  Because they're reprinting it now.
[01:37:41.341 --> 01:37:42.101]  It's sold out.
[01:37:42.802 --> 01:37:44.683]  I've tried to buy 5,000 from Skyhorse.
[01:37:45.323 --> 01:37:47.045]  We have sold his books before.
[01:37:47.065 --> 01:37:48.205]  It's like, wait, I know this guy.
[01:37:48.225 --> 01:37:48.906]  I've read his books.
[01:37:49.506 --> 01:37:49.726]  Wait.
[01:37:50.007 --> 01:37:51.628]  It's like, wow, once he was in the studio with us.
[01:37:51.648 --> 01:37:55.711]  Because I knew who he was, but not how prominent he was and how much he'd been involved in.
[01:37:56.539 --> 01:38:04.443]  He'll definitely be a staple of the show from now on because on elections, on third world, on presidents, you know, on Reagan.
[01:38:04.503 --> 01:38:06.564]  I mean, he knows so much about these guys he worked for.
[01:38:07.205 --> 01:38:17.190]  But what's exciting is he's known Trump for 30-something years and again was his exploratory head when he was thinking about running four or five years ago.
[01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:25.535]  And so he can really tell you about Donald Trump and what really makes Donald Trump tick and all these big scandals that are happening and the rest of it.
[01:38:26.456 --> 01:38:40.099]  Yes, if you can get The Clinton's War on Women, it is a hot book, sold out many places, and we're trying to get an emergency printing done right now so we get more before Christmas, but that is the bottom line.
[01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:51.004]  Now, continuing, ladies and gentlemen, with this info, I could sit here all day and bring up questions and comments for Mr. Stone.
[01:38:51.984 --> 01:39:03.570]  Whether he wants to get into the book first, whether he wants to get into the interview last week with Trump that he helped set up, and the inside baseball there, or whether he wants to dive into the current attacks on Trump.
[01:39:03.690 --> 01:39:06.291]  Let's let him decide what we get into first.
[01:39:06.811 --> 01:39:08.192]  Mr. Stone, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:39:08.752 --> 01:39:10.495]  Alex, thanks once again for having me.
[01:39:10.995 --> 01:39:11.276]  You bet.
[01:39:11.316 --> 01:39:12.237]  Where do you want to go first?
[01:39:12.778 --> 01:39:17.204]  Let's talk about the media savagery of Donald J. Trump.
[01:39:17.364 --> 01:39:23.552]  I must tell you, not since I saw Richard Nixon, my mentor, the man who gave me my start in politics,
[01:39:24.453 --> 01:39:33.001]  Under siege in 1974, while the mass media went out of their way to try to destroy him and drive him from public life, have I seen an onslaught like this?
[01:39:33.742 --> 01:39:43.391]  Donald Trump proposed a temporary ban on immigrants from Muslim countries until such time as U.S.
[01:39:43.551 --> 01:39:47.234]  representatives could get a handle on who wanted to come here.
[01:39:48.055 --> 01:39:51.456]  And the national media, as you know, has completely bastardized that.
[01:39:51.816 --> 01:39:59.238]  They have truncated his comments to make it appear that he called for a permanent ban of all Muslims for all time.
[01:39:59.258 --> 01:40:04.459]  And then they launched themselves into this long discussion of whether that would be unconstitutional.
[01:40:05.119 --> 01:40:08.320]  When in fact, that's not what Trump proposed at all.
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:11.081]  He put forward a common sense proposal
[01:40:11.781 --> 01:40:25.849]  Which the President of the United States clearly has the authority to do to freeze Muslim immigration temporarily until we can set up some kind of screening process to vet those who would like to come here.
[01:40:28.604 --> 01:40:29.704]  And that is what he said.
[01:40:29.824 --> 01:40:33.905]  They took it out of context to just say ban all Muslims and now they have all these people saying kill him.
[01:40:33.945 --> 01:40:35.286]  Rick Ross says he wants to murder him.
[01:40:35.866 --> 01:40:37.126]  The fake Rick Ross rapper.
[01:40:38.066 --> 01:40:51.209]  It's the cause celeb thing to do to pile on Lindsey Graham, Hillary Clinton saying he is helping ISIS when he's doing exactly what Russia is doing to take out ISIS before Russia even bombed their oil they're selling that they've stolen.
[01:40:51.769 --> 01:40:52.510]  He said do that.
[01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:54.190]  I mean he's been proven right on so many fronts.
[01:40:55.219 --> 01:41:01.443]  Yeah, you know, what this is, of course, is part and parcel of the fact that he scares the political class to death.
[01:41:02.163 --> 01:41:18.493]  The lobbyists, the consultant class, the special interests, the billionaires, Paul Singer, the Koch brothers, Steve Schwarzman, and others, because you would not have business as usual in Washington
[01:41:19.213 --> 01:41:20.994]  If Trump became president, good God!
[01:41:21.374 --> 01:41:26.276]  A president who actually worked for the American people and who couldn't be bought and sold.
[01:41:27.137 --> 01:41:36.981]  The other thing I found really laughable yesterday, Alex, was a charge by Jeb Bush, of all people, that Trump was in league with Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[01:41:37.881 --> 01:41:44.063]  That is, I can tell you, having known Trump for almost 40 years, that is laughable.
[01:41:44.143 --> 01:41:47.404]  He is one of the most competitive people in the country.
[01:41:47.664 --> 01:41:51.905]  He is running for president because he wants to save this country.
[01:41:52.385 --> 01:41:56.806]  Donald Trump would never be a straw man for someone else, anyone else.
[01:41:57.726 --> 01:42:03.788]  And frankly, he's the only guy in the country, the only guy in this race, who has legal standing
[01:42:04.909 --> 01:42:08.471]  To bring a lawsuit against the Clinton Foundation because they defrauded him.
[01:42:08.991 --> 01:42:12.173]  He made a modest contribution, thinking it was giving to charity.
[01:42:12.593 --> 01:42:16.716]  He now learns that he's given to a slush fund for grifters.
[01:42:17.356 --> 01:42:23.660]  Trump now has the power, through a lawsuit, to unravel the entire mess at the Clinton Foundation.
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:34.946]  Which is a slush fund for grifters, which is set up, as you know, as a vehicle for the facilitation of multi-million dollar bribes.
[01:42:35.346 --> 01:42:45.632]  So Trump poses an enormous threat to the Clintons, an enormous threat to the status quo in Washington, a threat to the political and ruling elites.
[01:42:46.232 --> 01:42:51.013]  Good God, if this man became president, he could uncover all of the government's data.
[01:42:51.033 --> 01:42:59.375]  Well, look at how he says when no other candidate's saying this, that he wants to get rid of the tax exemption for these big hedge funds and mega banks and make them pay a modest amount.
[01:42:59.735 --> 01:43:02.056]  I mean, that would literally fix so many of our problems.
[01:43:02.496 --> 01:43:08.897]  I mean, those are the big globalist companies like Goldman Sachs that run the anti-gun agenda, that run the open border agenda.
[01:43:09.217 --> 01:43:10.898]  They're the ones, almost every time,
[01:43:12.009 --> 01:43:14.830]  The irony, of course, is that Trump knows all these people.
[01:43:14.850 --> 01:43:16.010]  He socializes them.
[01:43:16.030 --> 01:43:23.573]  They're desperate to get into his club in Palm Beach, the Mar-a-Lago Club, which is the most exclusive and sought-after private club in Florida.
[01:43:36.417 --> 01:43:43.821]  But I might also add one of the few private clubs in Palm Beach that admits Jews and Hispanics and African-Americans.
[01:43:44.361 --> 01:43:52.365]  So it is almost laughable to see the panic at the political elite level.
[01:43:52.465 --> 01:43:56.107]  And that's why this unprecedented smear against Trump.
[01:43:56.167 --> 01:44:01.770]  The irony of this, of course, is that it's having the exact reverse effect, in my opinion.
[01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:17.539]  Meaning, the more the elites attack Trump, the more the talking heads on CNN rip him, the more the rights previces of the Republican National Committee come forward and denounce him, the stronger he gets.
[01:44:17.659 --> 01:44:23.382]  Because it is a signal to average people that this guy must threaten the status quo.
[01:44:23.702 --> 01:44:26.124]  That he is a real harbinger of change.
[01:44:26.524 --> 01:44:29.926]  So, yesterday, there was a Bloomberg survey
[01:44:30.586 --> 01:44:44.257]  We showed that two-thirds of Republican primary voters agreed with Trump when they were asked the narrow and fair question of whether they wanted a temporary halt in Muslim immigration.
[01:44:44.277 --> 01:44:52.824]  Of course, that's not what the mainstream media would have you believe he proposed, but there is overwhelming support for Trump's position.
[01:44:54.024 --> 01:45:01.948]  And I think that this also reflects a Reuters poll that was done on a daily tracking basis.
[01:45:01.968 --> 01:45:16.354]  While they didn't ask the precise question about Trump's proposal, they did look at Republican primary voter attitudes towards Muslims and the Muslim community, and they see the possibility of danger.
[01:45:16.554 --> 01:45:17.275]  They realize
[01:45:17.955 --> 01:45:30.127]  That of all these hundreds of thousands of immigrants who would like to come to this country, while I'm sure that many, many of them are decent, peace-loving people, Americans aren't stupid.
[01:45:30.307 --> 01:45:32.750]  They know that there's a terrorist contingent.
[01:45:33.010 --> 01:45:33.450]  In there.
[01:45:33.630 --> 01:45:38.633]  Of course, this is a zone, Syria, where hundreds of thousands of jihadis invaded.
[01:45:38.693 --> 01:45:40.254]  They've gotten their butts handed to them.
[01:45:40.654 --> 01:45:43.115]  So now they're getting into Turkey and Europe and coming to the U.S.
[01:45:43.435 --> 01:45:44.916]  There's a good percentage of them.
[01:45:44.956 --> 01:45:47.377]  I mean, we got polls.
[01:45:47.437 --> 01:45:48.438]  He cited them.
[01:45:48.658 --> 01:45:48.438]  21%, 25%, 27%.
[01:45:49.218 --> 01:45:50.659]  We showed those last hour on screen.
[01:45:50.679 --> 01:45:51.319]  We'll show them again.
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:53.841]  Saying they support jihad and suicide bombers.
[01:45:54.481 --> 01:45:56.284]  And they've got fake passports, most of them.
[01:45:56.465 --> 01:45:57.346]  They're not even Syria.
[01:45:57.807 --> 01:45:59.870]  We would be insane to continue this.
[01:46:00.091 --> 01:46:05.099]  So what is the government thinking, bringing them in, knowing they're going to blow stuff up and shoot people?
[01:46:05.899 --> 01:46:07.240]  Yeah, it's really extraordinary.
[01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:17.065]  Of course, we had the lesson of Paris, where a terrorist moved seamlessly through that nation's immigrant process to mastermind the mass killings last week.
[01:46:17.945 --> 01:46:21.747]  I don't know how, to use Trump's words, how stupid can the American people be?
[01:46:21.767 --> 01:46:27.450]  I must tell you, I'm very comfortable about an election that is framed around these issues.
[01:46:28.150 --> 01:46:38.498]  I am very comfortable comparing Trump's proposal with Hillary Clinton's record on Middle Eastern issues and of course her closest... You mean her record of giving Stinger missiles to Al-Qaeda?
[01:46:38.518 --> 01:46:39.118]  You mean that record?
[01:46:39.539 --> 01:46:51.387]  Well, the record of arming ISIS, because she's the one who armed them in her fury to try to depose Qaddafi and insert a regime that is loyal to... And now she says Trump's helping ISIS.
[01:46:51.627 --> 01:46:53.249]  You talk about upending reality.
[01:46:54.079 --> 01:46:56.040]  Yeah, it's Kafka-esque.
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:47:02.982]  It's typical big media, big government doublespeak where they say the exact opposite of what is true.
[01:47:03.402 --> 01:47:05.723]  The good news is the American people are waking up.
[01:47:06.123 --> 01:47:08.304]  They're not buying this line anymore.
[01:47:08.724 --> 01:47:09.985]  In my opinion, only Trump
[01:47:10.445 --> 01:47:14.127]  ...would put forward an aggressive strategy to crush ISIS.
[01:47:14.547 --> 01:47:21.051]  This pinprick approach that Barack Obama says he's utilizing clearly is not working at all.
[01:47:21.511 --> 01:47:34.739]  And then, you know, I am kind of interested because the other day Huma Abedin, also known as Mrs. Carlos Danger, the top aide to Hillary Clinton... Also known as Mrs. Hillary or Mrs. Hillary Clinton.
[01:47:35.139 --> 01:47:35.799]  Yeah, perhaps.
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:37.900]  But who is... I'm talking about Hillary.
[01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:38.581]  Which one is the Mrs.?
[01:47:39.481 --> 01:47:41.382]  It is hard to say, isn't it?
[01:47:41.502 --> 01:47:41.782]  Yes.
[01:47:42.282 --> 01:47:44.142]  But look, Huma is beautiful.
[01:47:44.302 --> 01:47:45.163]  She's exotic.
[01:47:46.203 --> 01:47:47.703]  She's very chicly dressed.
[01:47:47.803 --> 01:47:48.644]  Good for Hillary!
[01:47:49.704 --> 01:47:52.065]  And she's completely loyal to the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:47:52.485 --> 01:47:55.606]  Her parents and her brothers are very active in the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:47:56.006 --> 01:48:00.387]  She has written for a Muslim Brotherhood-funded publication for many years.
[01:48:01.087 --> 01:48:03.868]  Her loyalty is not to the United States, so one must ask,
[01:48:04.528 --> 01:48:06.930]  How did she get a security clearance from the U.S.
[01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:07.730]  State Department?
[01:48:08.010 --> 01:48:10.532]  Or maybe she never had a security clearance.
[01:48:10.872 --> 01:48:24.161]  Maybe that's why Hillary had to use an outside server so that Huma could look at all those classified documents and then decide what we should be allowed to see and what we shouldn't be allowed to see.
[01:48:24.181 --> 01:48:24.482]  That's right.
[01:48:25.342 --> 01:48:50.266]  I mean, I must tell you, I spent many years in government as an aide to three presidents, and I never saw a situation in which an individual got a special waiver that allowed her to get a full-time salary at the State Department, at the same time she's pulling down a second paycheck from Teneo, which is a Clinton-connected lobbying organization, which has clients that lobby the State Department,
[01:48:50.766 --> 01:48:56.590]  At the same time, whom is pulling down yet a third paycheck from the Clinton Foundation?
[01:48:57.210 --> 01:49:18.445]  Now we know that the Clinton Foundation and the State Department had business in the sense that many corporations, many foreign nations, many wealthy people realized if you had a big decision at State Department that meant millions of dollars to your pocket, you could buy American decision-making by giving enormous contributions to the Clinton Foundation.
[01:49:19.025 --> 01:49:24.049]  So, it really is a vehicle for the facilitation of these multi-million dollar bribes.
[01:49:25.130 --> 01:49:34.478]  Huma Abedin was right in the middle of that, and of course last week, or I should say earlier this week, Huma Abedin was among those denouncing Donald J. Trump.
[01:49:34.818 --> 01:49:38.140]  What could be a greater badge of honor than to be attacked by the man?
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:40.001]  Well, she tried to imply he wanted to throw her out.
[01:49:40.061 --> 01:49:43.203]  I mean, maybe she should be thrown out after her loyalties are investigated.
[01:49:43.503 --> 01:49:52.448]  I mean, I'm sick of the arrogance of all these foreigners and people that just think America is this big doormat and that we're here to be culled and cowed into submission.
[01:49:52.488 --> 01:49:54.189]  But getting back to Donald Trump himself.
[01:49:55.049 --> 01:49:58.152]  Six months ago, when this stuff first started, I wasn't sure.
[01:49:58.172 --> 01:49:59.133]  I did more research.
[01:50:00.354 --> 01:50:02.436]  And then I saw where he was with so many policies.
[01:50:02.496 --> 01:50:03.837]  I saw how they demonized him.
[01:50:04.257 --> 01:50:06.299]  I saw how the big money came out against him.
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:10.103]  I saw the Republican leadership line up against him.
[01:50:10.243 --> 01:50:12.405]  All that was a better sign that he really was for real.
[01:50:13.687 --> 01:50:16.450]  Now I've seen him come out against the big banks being tax exempt.
[01:50:17.071 --> 01:50:19.334]  I've seen him come out unequivocally for the Second Amendment.
[01:50:20.055 --> 01:50:23.238]  I've seen him come out for blowing up the ISIS oil fields.
[01:50:23.779 --> 01:50:26.542]  All this stuff is the opposite of what the establishment wants.
[01:50:26.963 --> 01:50:28.465]  He clearly knows what he's talking about.
[01:50:28.985 --> 01:50:30.948]  And then he talks about how our borders are gone.
[01:50:30.988 --> 01:50:32.329]  We're being brought into globalism.
[01:50:32.670 --> 01:50:33.671]  We're being shut down.
[01:50:33.711 --> 01:50:34.753]  We're being dismantled.
[01:50:35.173 --> 01:50:39.238]  And I'm just not hearing this out of anybody but Ted Cruz and a little bit out of Rand Paul.
[01:50:39.258 --> 01:50:40.820]  And I've supported, you know, both of them.
[01:50:40.860 --> 01:50:42.623]  I'd be happy with any three of those guys being president.
[01:50:43.063 --> 01:50:45.346]  But then I just love the fact that
[01:50:46.394 --> 01:50:47.756]  He calls out the media.
[01:50:47.976 --> 01:50:55.244]  He's already started a revolution in the debates where they all laugh at the moderators, who are basically political pundits.
[01:50:55.685 --> 01:51:03.594]  And I see the whole facade, the force field around the globalist, almost dissolving with just Donald Trump being a candidate.
[01:51:04.174 --> 01:51:04.915]  It's like, it's...
[01:51:06.516 --> 01:51:10.077]  Like, he's anti-matter to these people, and it really excites me.
[01:51:10.757 --> 01:51:18.019]  And the fact that he's not a coward, the fact that he is the man in the arena, the fact that he doesn't back down, is so exciting.
[01:51:18.499 --> 01:51:29.142]  And that's what we need again, is someone who is an individual, someone who doesn't come from some weirdo, leftist cult, or some neocon cult, or some, you know, weird group.
[01:51:29.442 --> 01:51:34.184]  We need somebody who really does want to turn this country loose to do great things.
[01:51:34.484 --> 01:51:35.284]  And I'm sold.
[01:51:36.064 --> 01:51:37.185]  But Donald Trump's for real.
[01:51:37.645 --> 01:51:44.290]  I'm sold he really wants to cut taxes and bring back our sovereignty and kick criminals out of the nation and do all those things.
[01:51:44.971 --> 01:51:51.976]  I just ask myself, though, when he does shoot from the hip, he is teleprompter free, he is talking point free.
[01:51:52.457 --> 01:51:57.300]  What's brought him to this prominence could also be taken out of context to bring him down.
[01:51:57.901 --> 01:51:58.881]  But maybe that is
[01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:09.167]  A sign that the public has so much broken with the establishment that they don't care what they do to him, they're going to continue to support him.
[01:52:09.467 --> 01:52:16.653]  Hey, I want you to speak to that as a top presidential advisor, a guy that's run major campaigns around the world, Roger Stone, our guest.
[01:52:16.753 --> 01:52:20.015]  And then specifically, what are the dirty tricks they're going to pull?
[01:52:20.736 --> 01:52:28.602]  What is the mathematical electorate constellation that tells you he is electable in a general election, Roger Stone?
[01:52:31.209 --> 01:52:33.010]  Well, let's tackle those one by one.
[01:52:33.070 --> 01:52:38.393]  First of all, I have no question that he is the strongest possible candidate against Hillary Clinton.
[01:52:38.513 --> 01:52:47.357]  Even some of the preliminary polls, and I don't mean online polls where you can vote and then push refresh and vote again and then vote and push refresh and vote again.
[01:52:47.377 --> 01:52:58.663]  I'm talking about scientific-based polls with an accurate and carefully balanced, perfectly drawn sample show that Trump is already pulling unprecedented levels of blacks
[01:52:59.423 --> 01:53:02.545]  Well, I think it's even beyond that.
[01:53:02.565 --> 01:53:03.606]  I think it's beyond Reagan Democrats.
[01:53:17.054 --> 01:53:31.558]  Yes, I think he can get those blue collar ethnic Democrats, those working class Democrats who are as sick of the elitism and the big government and the big spending and the big taxing policies and the low employment policies of Washington.
[01:53:31.578 --> 01:53:36.200]  But beyond that, I think there are millions of people who like you and I, Alex, realize
[01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:39.642]  That both parties have morphed into one party.
[01:53:40.383 --> 01:53:46.467]  That the choice that is presented to the voters, like the choice between Romney and Obama, is a false choice.
[01:53:47.108 --> 01:53:53.353]  That the two parties are the same, the parties of endless war, erosion of our civil liberties, massive debt.
[01:53:54.633 --> 01:53:58.434]  Unhinged spending, the list goes on and on.
[01:53:58.514 --> 01:54:07.417]  So I think there are millions of Americans for whom Trump looks like something different, a real reformer.
[01:54:07.477 --> 01:54:16.539]  I think he can pull those people back into the political process, and that is why he is the strongest potential Republican candidate.
[01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:21.761]  It aggravates me that people keep asking him, well, are you going to run as an independent?
[01:54:22.830 --> 01:54:27.595]  He's the frontrunner for the Republican nomination, not by a little bit, by a lot, by 10 points.
[01:54:28.135 --> 01:54:29.537]  Why would he even consider it?
[01:54:29.577 --> 01:54:32.440]  With all due respect, go ask Rand Paul that question.
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:33.841]  He's running last.
[01:54:34.402 --> 01:54:37.945]  His father once bolted the GOP to run as an independent.
[01:54:38.005 --> 01:54:41.749]  Maybe it's a more appropriate question for Senator Paul at this point.
[01:54:41.769 --> 01:54:42.429]  I want to be clear.
[01:54:42.530 --> 01:54:43.270]  I don't want to run.
[01:54:44.231 --> 01:54:52.279]  Senator Rand Paul down, but I'm an honest person, and I knew him 20 years ago, back when he campaigned for his dad, when his district came into Austin.
[01:54:53.560 --> 01:55:01.528]  I've supported him, been nice to him, his dad comes on, total integrity, love the Pauls, but the way Rand gets advised now, the things he does,
[01:55:03.982 --> 01:55:06.724]  I mean, you notice Ted Cruz is smart and isn't attacking Trump.
[01:55:07.484 --> 01:55:08.465]  I just don't get it.
[01:55:08.525 --> 01:55:11.647]  And I really wanted Rand to be more aggressive, like a Trump.
[01:55:13.068 --> 01:55:15.210]  And it's just, it's just very sad.
[01:55:15.230 --> 01:55:19.493]  Yeah, no, look, I share your high regard for both Rand Paul and his father.
[01:55:19.553 --> 01:55:26.778]  The very last vote I cast as a Republican was for Ron Paul in the Florida primary against Mitt Romney.
[01:55:27.858 --> 01:55:32.380]  And I'm an admirer of Rand Paul, although I think he seems to have lost his bearings here.
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:34.240]  I mean, I'm not sure who he is.
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:35.941]  You can't be all things to all men.
[01:55:36.001 --> 01:55:43.883]  You can't be both a libertarian and a traditional conservative, and then try to trim your foreign policy to show that you really are a statist.
[01:55:44.363 --> 01:55:48.945]  I just think his candidacy has failed, and sadly, I think it is over.
[01:55:49.365 --> 01:55:52.666]  But the personal attacks on Donald Trump, those I can't figure out.
[01:55:53.146 --> 01:55:54.166]  They have golfed together.
[01:55:54.246 --> 01:55:59.268]  I happen to know that Donald Trump likes Senator Paul and says, by the way, he's an exceptional golfer.
[01:55:59.808 --> 01:56:06.231]  So it is... Well, that's probably why Trump's been snapping back at him because they were friends and then Paul makes crappy comments about him.
[01:56:06.811 --> 01:56:14.474]  Well, one thing I can tell you about Trump, having spent an enormous amount of time with him, if you punch Trump, you better be prepared to get punched back at twice the velocity.
[01:56:15.134 --> 01:56:16.394]  It's just his nature.
[01:56:16.534 --> 01:56:19.635]  Do not awaken the sleeping beast.
[01:56:19.655 --> 01:56:24.116]  If you attack Donald Trump, you better expect incoming, and it'll be almost immediate.
[01:56:25.256 --> 01:56:27.997]  Well, moving on from Senator Paul, it's a sad story.
[01:56:28.017 --> 01:56:36.599]  Just kind of let the dead bury the dead politically at this point, unless he wakes up with those snot-nosed young Republicans he's got around him up there in his campaign.
[01:56:36.619 --> 01:56:40.639]  I don't mean to be mean, but that's just... I mean, you're talking about the tail wagging the dog here.
[01:56:40.959 --> 01:56:42.080]  I'm just going to say it and move on.
[01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:45.971]  How do we get behind Trump?
[01:56:46.011 --> 01:56:47.392]  How do we stop the dirty tricks?
[01:56:47.872 --> 01:56:49.173]  How do we get him into the presidency?
[01:56:49.193 --> 01:56:51.015]  Because nothing makes me like him more.
[01:56:51.035 --> 01:56:57.960]  I mean, I'm moving towards the 100% mark now, with all these wolves attacking and all these cowards piling on the one man in the arena.
[01:56:57.980 --> 01:57:00.902]  You're talking my language right there.
[01:57:02.028 --> 01:57:10.730]  Well, let me just predict right now that the next major attack on Trump will be a bogus claim that he is somehow mobbed up.
[01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:15.651]  There's a half dozen news organizations who've been working on this for months.
[01:57:15.731 --> 01:57:24.573]  Now, what they don't seem to know is that Trump has, for over 15 years, held a New Jersey casino control operator's license.
[01:57:25.362 --> 01:57:31.685]  The New Jersey casino control law is the most stringent law in the country.
[01:57:31.725 --> 01:57:36.447]  In other words, you can be denied a license just having met a mobster.
[01:57:36.487 --> 01:57:40.109]  You don't have to do business with them, you don't have to trade money with them, you don't have to buy anything from them.
[01:57:40.629 --> 01:57:45.911]  Just a social occasion in which you are together can be enough to deny you a license.
[01:57:46.252 --> 01:57:52.995]  They are very, very, very sensitive to organized crime influence in the gaming industry in New Jersey.
[01:57:53.755 --> 01:58:01.257]  The New Jersey law is so stringent, it is the model for most of the laws in the country that have legalized casino gambling.
[01:58:01.758 --> 01:58:07.400]  Donald Trump has been gone over by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission with a proctoscope.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.160]  There is nothing there.
[01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:15.542]  Now, being in the construction industry in the Northeastern United States, has he met guys who are mob connected?
[01:58:15.982 --> 01:58:16.503]  Probably.
[01:58:17.283 --> 01:58:18.423]  Is he in bed with the mob?
[01:58:18.583 --> 01:58:20.504]  In no way, shape, or form.
[01:58:21.204 --> 01:58:23.265]  And no one ever alleged that with his dad and people.
[01:58:23.305 --> 01:58:26.627]  It is hard to believe he's one of the only clean people, you know, in that whole thing.
[01:58:26.667 --> 01:58:30.189]  But he was the outsider, it was well known, that came in and broke into that.
[01:58:30.649 --> 01:58:31.650]  That's why he carried a gun.
[01:58:31.690 --> 01:58:32.430]  I mean, that's what I've read.
[01:58:32.470 --> 01:58:33.011]  Is that correct?
[01:58:33.371 --> 01:58:34.412]  That is absolutely right.
[01:58:34.452 --> 01:58:35.972]  Donald Trump is squeaky clean.
[01:58:36.793 --> 01:58:43.116]  But be prepared for a mainstream media onslaught trying to claim that he is somehow mobbed up.
[01:58:43.297 --> 01:58:45.618]  Alright, so that's going to be the empire striking back.
[01:58:45.638 --> 01:58:46.258]  Stay there, sir.
[01:58:46.278 --> 01:58:47.259]  Back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:47.679 --> 01:58:49.020]  Trump Insider, on with us right now.
[01:58:51.073 --> 01:58:52.936]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:54.478 --> 01:58:56.661]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:59:00.066 --> 01:59:04.508]  Who do you prefer, Barack Obama or George W. Bush?
[01:59:04.888 --> 01:59:09.811]  Well, if you haven't figured it out by now, these guys are corporate spokesmen.
[01:59:09.851 --> 01:59:10.651]  They're not leaders.
[01:59:10.911 --> 01:59:13.232]  I mean, they both started illegal wars.
[01:59:13.572 --> 01:59:15.153]  Hell, they both tortured people.
[01:59:15.393 --> 01:59:18.995]  They bailed out criminal corporations and they spied on you.
[01:59:19.175 --> 01:59:23.557]  They both violated the Constitution and they even committed war crimes.
[01:59:23.897 --> 01:59:24.778]  So what's it gonna take?
[01:59:25.058 --> 01:59:27.520]  I mean, what will it take to finally wake you up?
[01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:28.340]  Think about it.
[01:59:28.620 --> 01:59:37.567]  If Joseph Stalin ran for president as a Democrat, and Adolf Hitler ran as a Republican, one of them would end up leading our country.
[01:59:37.887 --> 01:59:39.809]  It's politics incorporated.
[01:59:40.069 --> 01:59:43.471]  And your choice between the two parties is a myth.
[01:59:43.651 --> 01:59:48.415]  Because in reality, it is a two-party tyranny with one ideology.
[01:59:48.535 --> 01:59:50.016]  Divide and conquer.
[01:59:50.276 --> 01:59:54.920]  So join the revolution and break the false left versus right paradigm.
[01:59:55.240 --> 02:00:06.589]  Infowars.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:15.096 --> 02:00:17.498]  It's a long way to the top if you want to be present.
[02:00:18.570 --> 02:00:20.414]  As a part of a political combine like Obama.
[02:00:20.714 --> 02:00:24.722]  From the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.324 --> 02:00:38.130]  Roger Stone, I can tell you, is swift-boating the Clintons and the Bushes as a best-selling author with accurate info.
[02:00:38.170 --> 02:00:40.091]  I've read the Clintons' War on Women.
[02:00:41.212 --> 02:00:45.915]  I can't wait till the book on the Bush crime family, Jeb and the Bush crime family, comes out.
[02:00:46.756 --> 02:00:49.217]  These are both topics I'm very well-researched on.
[02:00:49.237 --> 02:00:53.220]  So when I hear Stone speaking to it, when he was on last time, it was so incredibly accurate.
[02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:54.061]  We'll cover some of that.
[02:00:54.941 --> 02:00:57.724]  Uh, coming up in the next segment, and then I promise I'll go to your calls.
[02:00:57.764 --> 02:01:03.248]  I'm sorry to Tony, Isaiah, Erica, Kevin, Dan, and others.
[02:01:03.369 --> 02:01:07.772]  I know I said I'd go to your calls, and then I didn't, and then the guests got on, but I will in the next segment.
[02:01:07.792 --> 02:01:11.456]  We'll get some of your calls out of the way with your comments and questions on Trump, I promise.
[02:01:12.236 --> 02:01:12.637]  Uh, but...
[02:01:13.860 --> 02:01:15.221]  It takes a lot of will.
[02:01:15.921 --> 02:01:21.125]  This fellow's worked directly with three presidents very closely, worked for many others as well, but, you know, been in the Oval Office.
[02:01:21.885 --> 02:01:23.726]  And this is a very dangerous book.
[02:01:24.186 --> 02:01:32.952]  And the other one, from the facts he stated from it that I know to be true, because I am an expert on these subjects, I've been living it for 20 years, interviewing all the people involved.
[02:01:32.972 --> 02:01:39.856]  I mean, the CIA pilots who were there unloading the cocaine with the Bushes and the Clintons, I mean, the Bushes and the Clintons totally work for each other.
[02:01:40.176 --> 02:01:40.957]  They are mafia.
[02:01:42.679 --> 02:01:44.360]  They are the mafia above the mafia.
[02:01:44.380 --> 02:01:50.504]  I mean, they denied until the fifties that Lacosa Nostra existed, and then it became only mafia was Italian.
[02:01:51.624 --> 02:01:52.505]  That's ridiculous.
[02:01:52.545 --> 02:01:54.206]  The real mob is above that.
[02:01:55.126 --> 02:02:01.110]  And really, Donald Trump, from what I've seen, is trying to break into their system with the people.
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:07.622]  But you look at the Bushes, the Clintons, to me they're the original mafia, the true mafia, you know, the term Arkansas.
[02:02:07.662 --> 02:02:15.165]  I mean, is that not an accurate statement, Roger Stone, that they better watch out throwing stones in glass houses because these are the true mafiosos?
[02:02:15.705 --> 02:02:16.646]  Yeah, there's no question.
[02:02:16.966 --> 02:02:19.547]  I refer to it as the Bush-Clinton crime syndicate.
[02:02:20.487 --> 02:02:24.529]  And my two books, The Clintons' War on Women and the upcoming Jeb,
[02:02:26.470 --> 02:02:28.591]  And the Bush crime family, they're really bookends.
[02:02:28.631 --> 02:02:44.322]  They're really complement each other in terms of detailing the profiteering and criminal activity that both families have conducted together, rehabilitating each other, profiteering together, boosting each other politically.
[02:02:44.762 --> 02:02:57.991]  You know, Alex, I had to reflect on that commercial that I just heard because, as you know, I cut my teeth in politics working for Richard Nixon, and Nixon was very, very proud of his martini-making talents.
[02:02:58.291 --> 02:03:02.514]  He made a mean martini, and he referred to them as silver bullets.
[02:03:03.875 --> 02:03:11.061]  So as soon as you would get to his place in Saddle Ridge, he would say, hey, how about a silver bullet?
[02:03:11.081 --> 02:03:13.924]  And then he himself would make you a very dry martini.
[02:03:14.605 --> 02:03:17.908]  And you would drink the martini and you'd say, wow, Mr. President, this is fabulous.
[02:03:17.948 --> 02:03:20.550]  And he said, yeah, let me tell you my recipe.
[02:03:21.010 --> 02:03:25.515]  He says you take a bottle of olives, you drain the olives, you pour in vermouth,
[02:03:26.195 --> 02:03:26.275]  Wow!
[02:03:44.835 --> 02:03:49.116]  See, I just want to get you on time to talk about all these presidential stories, because they're so interesting.
[02:03:49.156 --> 02:03:50.757]  And I don't romanticize Nixon.
[02:03:50.777 --> 02:03:51.817]  I know he had some problems.
[02:03:51.857 --> 02:03:52.877]  Many problems.
[02:03:52.917 --> 02:03:56.478]  But compared to other ones, I mean, he was one of the least criminal from what I've known.
[02:03:57.399 --> 02:04:02.720]  And that's why they took him out, was because he wanted to actually be president and the bureaucracy wanted to be in charge.
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:03.380]  Is that accurate?
[02:04:03.901 --> 02:04:07.962]  Yes, and he was challenging the industrial complex war machine.
[02:04:08.062 --> 02:04:08.242]  Good.
[02:04:08.542 --> 02:04:09.882]  He ended the war in Vietnam.
[02:04:09.902 --> 02:04:11.563]  That cut into their profits.
[02:04:11.983 --> 02:04:17.769]  He opened the door to conversations with China and a relationship with China, and then he moved to the SALT agreement.
[02:04:17.829 --> 02:04:20.071]  So, Nixon turned out to be a peacemaker.
[02:04:20.131 --> 02:04:24.596]  That's not what the boys at the Pentagon or the Central Intelligence Agency had in mind.
[02:04:24.636 --> 02:04:26.437]  Now look, Nixon was far from perfect.
[02:04:26.838 --> 02:04:29.641]  Taking us off the gold standard, enormous mistake.
[02:04:30.081 --> 02:04:33.545]  The war on drugs, a big, expensive, inefficient mistake.
[02:04:34.165 --> 02:04:42.095]  I don't make the case, although I have great affection for Nixon and his personal resilience, I make no case that he was in any way perfect.
[02:04:42.655 --> 02:04:53.648]  But compared to the illegality, unconstitutionality of what we have today, Nixon would be rolling in his grave if he saw what Barack Obama and the Clintons have gotten away with.
[02:04:54.369 --> 02:04:55.351]  Absolutely, stay there.
[02:04:55.371 --> 02:04:57.334]  I want to come back, hit some phone calls with you.
[02:04:57.374 --> 02:04:58.776]  We got you for the rest of the hour.
[02:04:59.257 --> 02:05:04.085]  Then I want to get more into how we get behind Donald Trump because, I mean folks, the whole system's coming after him.
[02:05:04.125 --> 02:05:05.988]  That right there is the certification he's for real.
[02:05:10.996 --> 02:05:16.381]  Did you know that when you're serving jury duty, you have complete authority over the law and the power to stop the government?
[02:05:16.481 --> 02:05:16.901]  That's right.
[02:05:16.981 --> 02:05:21.125]  As a juror, you can not only judge the defendant, but also the law he's being charged with as well.
[02:05:21.145 --> 02:05:24.027]  And that's a little-known secret prosecutors don't want you to know.
[02:05:24.207 --> 02:05:28.170]  For example, let's say a man is charged with marijuana possession and you don't agree with that law.
[02:05:28.290 --> 02:05:32.374]  Well, as a juror, you can decline charging the man because you don't believe the law is justified.
[02:05:32.554 --> 02:05:37.919]  Judges and prosecutors have misled juries into believing that they should only examine the facts of the case and not the law.
[02:05:38.179 --> 02:05:41.922]  But the juror can actually stop the enforcement of unconstitutional laws in two ways.
[02:05:42.222 --> 02:05:46.226]  As a grand juror, you may refuse the government's request to pursue criminal charges against the accused.
[02:05:46.506 --> 02:05:50.990]  And as a trial juror, you can acquit the offendant who is charged with breaking an unconstitutional law.
[02:05:51.190 --> 02:05:57.395]  Either way, by using jury nullification, the juror has the power to say no, thus having an immediate and direct effect on our government.
[02:05:57.475 --> 02:06:03.939]  You can find out more from the Fully Informed Jury Association, which can be found at www.fija.org.

[02:07:13.307 --> 02:07:19.432]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:07:19.612 --> 02:07:26.618]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[02:07:26.898 --> 02:07:35.705]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[02:07:36.005 --> 02:07:41.928]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:07:42.188 --> 02:07:46.951]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:07:47.011 --> 02:07:50.352]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:07:50.612 --> 02:07:52.233]  No needles, no injections.
[02:07:52.493 --> 02:07:54.014]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:07:54.134 --> 02:07:55.175]  Try it for yourself.

[02:08:05.681 --> 02:08:06.788]  InfoWars Life Secret 12.
[02:08:22.179 --> 02:08:24.380]  The world is a dangerous place.
[02:08:24.701 --> 02:08:29.644]  Not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:08:30.664 --> 02:08:34.567]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:35.027 --> 02:08:38.869]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:08:39.190 --> 02:08:40.690]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:41.311 --> 02:08:46.854]  Take the children and yourself and hide out in the cellar.
[02:08:47.955 --> 02:08:51.017]  By now the fighting will be close
[02:08:53.311 --> 02:09:02.495]  In the final equation... The elite have a 9% approval rating for Congress.
[02:09:04.336 --> 02:09:06.077]  The people are waking up in general.
[02:09:06.097 --> 02:09:09.759]  The attempt to flood the country with immigrants that are ignorant isn't gonna work.
[02:09:11.015 --> 02:09:14.016]  The overall globalist strategy is collapsing.
[02:09:15.357 --> 02:09:17.918]  They have a strategy of tension to keep people in turmoil.
[02:09:18.819 --> 02:09:30.684]  But when they even use those systems on the first world, their command base, their funding, their power, their prowess, their good name, their soft power, in the end it brings these elites down as well.
[02:09:31.625 --> 02:09:34.566]  Rome did the same thing 1800 years ago, began its collapse.
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:39.580]  It took 200 years but it happened.
[02:09:39.700 --> 02:10:00.606]  Nowadays things happen a lot quicker and whether it's Europe or the United States we see a willful suiciding of the good institutions and of common sense by a criminal class that wants to loot like barbarian vagabonds or Visigoths the system itself.
[02:10:00.666 --> 02:10:04.567]  They want to kill the golden goose and I say that from a cynical
[02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:06.281]  Perspective.
[02:10:06.521 --> 02:10:08.162]  I personally am chivalrous.
[02:10:08.222 --> 02:10:09.143]  I have a moral perspective.
[02:10:09.163 --> 02:10:10.264]  It's where my energy comes from.
[02:10:10.564 --> 02:10:11.265]  It's who I am.
[02:10:11.865 --> 02:10:13.226]  I'm looking for other people like me.
[02:10:15.448 --> 02:10:21.433]  But even as a sociopath, if I looked at it through those eyes, which I do, any general is supposed to look through their enemy's eyes.
[02:10:22.194 --> 02:10:26.777]  This doesn't even make sense until you realize it's their very instinct to screw everything up.
[02:10:27.158 --> 02:10:34.104]  We're going to ask Roger Stone about that, about knowing Donald Trump for decades, what really makes him tick.
[02:10:35.117 --> 02:10:45.708]  Because I think personalizing him is the one thing people really want to know about to commit their support for him, what he thinks they'll do to try to shut him down after the mob claims he says are coming.
[02:10:45.988 --> 02:10:47.610]  And I already see that drum beginning to beat.
[02:10:49.301 --> 02:11:00.108]  And then we'll get into other facets of this in general, where Mr. Stone sees the world going, and then have him back soon for another interview about presidents in general and politics.
[02:11:00.128 --> 02:11:09.313]  I want to talk about some of the delegate processes, some of the dirty tricks they might pull to try to keep Trump out, how we get involved in the delegate process, like my friend Richard Reeves is, to try to stop that.
[02:11:09.934 --> 02:11:16.138]  And that's a whole other interview as well, probably in person here, because I want Stone to be with us a lot because of his understanding of this.
[02:11:18.151 --> 02:11:19.893]  But now let's go to some phone calls.
[02:11:20.634 --> 02:11:23.478]  Again, the website is StoneZone.com.
[02:11:23.498 --> 02:11:30.266]  It's an excellent site with commentary, photos, analysis, decades with him working at the White House and his books.
[02:11:30.727 --> 02:11:32.769]  The new book is The Clinton's War on Women.
[02:11:33.570 --> 02:11:34.831]  And if you can find it, good luck.
[02:11:34.891 --> 02:11:38.333]  It's sold out in many areas, but we're trying to get 5,000 of them ourselves.
[02:11:38.634 --> 02:11:39.734]  Very hot book right now.
[02:11:40.655 --> 02:11:43.457]  But let's go to Tony in Tennessee.
[02:11:43.497 --> 02:11:44.118]  Thank you for holding.
[02:11:44.138 --> 02:11:44.678]  You're a trooper.
[02:11:45.018 --> 02:11:47.800]  Listening on WBCR 1470 AM.
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:48.681]  You're on the air.
[02:11:48.741 --> 02:11:49.081]  Go ahead.
[02:11:50.702 --> 02:11:51.823]  Oh, thanks for taking my call.
[02:11:51.983 --> 02:11:53.584]  I've been a listener since 99.
[02:11:55.245 --> 02:11:58.908]  You know, there's a special out there that everybody needs to go listen to.
[02:11:59.568 --> 02:12:00.109]  It's called
[02:12:00.845 --> 02:12:11.168]  You've been trumped down about four years ago, and this is what Donald Trump tried to do to the people over in Scotland because he wanted to build a golf course.
[02:12:12.348 --> 02:12:13.389]  He's not a nice guy.
[02:12:13.569 --> 02:12:22.371]  Now, I have heard that the one little chink people can bring up is imminent domain issues, and then that's brought up all day, and that's just what builders go through.
[02:12:22.511 --> 02:12:24.512]  I'm not saying that's perfect or that's fine.
[02:12:25.472 --> 02:12:29.373]  Let me ask you, would you rather have Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, or Jeb Bush then?
[02:12:30.569 --> 02:12:37.911]  Well, then there is also the matter of the four million dollars that you just now gave your ex-wife in your recent divorce.
[02:12:37.931 --> 02:12:42.832]  Okay, none of that's true, and so that was some kind of weird seminar call right there.
[02:12:42.852 --> 02:12:46.873]  This is somebody, I guess, that just doesn't like this broadcast.
[02:12:46.893 --> 02:12:49.774]  Would you like to... and that's fine, make up whatever you want.
[02:12:50.374 --> 02:12:52.395]  Let's go ahead and get Roger Stone's take on that.
[02:12:54.353 --> 02:13:10.518]  You know, Donald Trump is a developer, and he has skepticism about so-called green energy, about this windmill technology, which turns out to be far more expensive than the older technologies to generate electricity.
[02:13:11.298 --> 02:13:14.359]  He's built some of the greatest golf courses in the world.
[02:13:14.839 --> 02:13:17.580]  He's built some of the greatest resorts in the world.
[02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:20.141]  In fact, he's climbed to the top of that mountain.
[02:13:20.181 --> 02:13:24.925]  That's why I think he's now turning his energy towards saving this country.
[02:13:25.585 --> 02:13:28.327]  He's done every great real estate development that you can have.
[02:13:28.727 --> 02:13:30.608]  Alex, this guy has a terrific life.
[02:13:31.249 --> 02:13:33.010]  He's got a beautiful family that he loves.
[02:13:33.050 --> 02:13:34.291]  He likes spending time with them.
[02:13:34.771 --> 02:13:36.973]  He's a scratch golfer and he loves to play golf.
[02:13:37.093 --> 02:13:43.617]  But instead, he's made 18 trips to Iowa on Saturdays to meet voters and roll out a campaign.
[02:13:45.598 --> 02:13:52.141]  There's no question, once he becomes president, he will be stepping down in terms of the quality of his airplane and his home.
[02:13:52.601 --> 02:14:01.124]  Not that there's anything wrong with Air Force One and the White House, but I've seen the Trump lifestyle and he lives like what he is, a self-made billionaire.
[02:14:01.845 --> 02:14:10.908]  In all honesty, when we're talking about this nation's absolute survival, then a golf course in Scotland seems kind of mundane.
[02:14:10.928 --> 02:14:13.049]  Well sure, and Americans, Americans,
[02:14:14.312 --> 02:14:21.354]  I hate unmade people who have made hundreds of millions like Hillary with her total elitism where you can't even look her in the eyes.
[02:14:21.394 --> 02:14:28.436]  This has been confirmed when she's at a hotel or being served by somebody, doesn't give people tips, treats them like total crud.
[02:14:29.076 --> 02:14:41.420]  I've gotten turned on to Trump more the last six months investigating him, talking to people that you don't even know, you know, he knows or knows, that say, big tipper, super nice, treats everybody so good, unless you mess with him, then he's pretty aggressive.
[02:14:42.900 --> 02:14:43.741]  This is the irony.
[02:14:44.001 --> 02:14:49.983]  For a guy who's worth $10 billion, probably more at this point, he's a regular guy.
[02:14:50.863 --> 02:14:52.483]  He's very, very funny.
[02:14:52.824 --> 02:14:54.244]  He's got a great sense of humor.
[02:14:54.644 --> 02:14:56.125]  He loves a good cheeseburger.
[02:14:56.805 --> 02:14:58.545]  He's got a risque sense of humor.
[02:14:59.506 --> 02:15:00.726]  He's fun to be with.
[02:15:00.786 --> 02:15:06.368]  Working for Trump, I can honestly tell you, over the years, I've worked on and off for him for 37 years.
[02:15:06.768 --> 02:15:08.068]  It has always been fun.
[02:15:08.188 --> 02:15:09.469]  I've had a good time.
[02:15:09.989 --> 02:15:17.454]  Well, I actually like the fact that he'll go on a lot of wild shows, not just mine, but something like Howard Stern, when all these other fake stuff suits wouldn't do it.
[02:15:17.754 --> 02:15:20.016]  We need somebody that'll get in there and get their hands dirty.
[02:15:20.056 --> 02:15:23.618]  I'm sick of all this fake elitism, and I did look into the whole thing.
[02:15:23.658 --> 02:15:30.903]  You know, he pays for it, he gets it, there's a plan for a golf course, then people start wanting more money, and then you run over him and build a golf course.
[02:15:31.263 --> 02:15:32.183]  Could you say it's bad?
[02:15:32.223 --> 02:15:33.064]  Could you say it's good?
[02:15:33.364 --> 02:15:34.485]  Wait until you're in those shoes.
[02:15:34.865 --> 02:15:37.567]  The question is, do you want, would you rather have Hillary Clinton?
[02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:41.552]  And then the guy didn't respond to that, he just made something up.
[02:15:42.252 --> 02:15:44.774]  Well, look, that was a crank call as far as I'm concerned.
[02:15:44.834 --> 02:16:00.103]  Here's what's interesting, and that is that I love the way Trump, for example, last night with Don Lemon on CNN, or last weekend with Chuck Todd, where he won't be bullied by these commentators, where he cuts them off.
[02:16:00.723 --> 02:16:05.006]  And he says, no wait a minute Chuck, cool it, cool down Chuck.
[02:16:05.446 --> 02:16:18.236]  Or when he says last night to Don Lemon, excuse me, excuse me, when they try to cut him off, which as you know is a classic media stunt to try to dominate these and bully these political figures.
[02:16:19.637 --> 02:16:22.078]  Well that's what they try with me and I just do it right back to them.
[02:16:22.118 --> 02:16:22.799]  They can't stand it.
[02:16:22.819 --> 02:16:23.960]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:27.322]  Let's go ahead and talk to Isaiah in California.
[02:16:27.342 --> 02:16:28.443]  You're on the air with our guest.
[02:16:30.862 --> 02:16:31.863]  Alex, how's it going?
[02:16:31.963 --> 02:16:32.343]  Good, brother.
[02:16:32.363 --> 02:16:32.643]  Go ahead.
[02:16:33.903 --> 02:16:41.507]  I just want to say thank you for putting me on the air and I want to kind of give a shout out to your Echo of War's life.
[02:16:42.007 --> 02:16:43.928]  I have a lot of your products and they're awesome.
[02:16:44.308 --> 02:16:45.068]  Thank you.
[02:16:45.569 --> 02:16:46.409]  But that's besides the point.
[02:16:48.690 --> 02:16:50.271]  I want to say Trump, he's a fighter.
[02:16:50.571 --> 02:16:52.312]  You know, you guys have been kind of talking about that.
[02:16:53.512 --> 02:16:55.033]  And he's ruthless, man.
[02:16:55.606 --> 02:16:57.207]  I think he's good for America.
[02:16:57.227 --> 02:17:02.529]  Of course, I'm always skeptical of any kind of politician myself.
[02:17:04.049 --> 02:17:07.491]  But, you know, people are going to attack him.
[02:17:07.571 --> 02:17:09.672]  They're going to continuously attack him.
[02:17:10.252 --> 02:17:12.553]  And I think he's kind of got the goal for it.
[02:17:13.373 --> 02:17:14.874]  And I believe, you know,
[02:17:15.450 --> 02:17:19.631]  Even if he doesn't win this war, he's already done a lot of damage just by running the race.
[02:17:19.931 --> 02:17:20.251]  I agree.
[02:17:20.291 --> 02:17:23.452]  He's brought out a lot of stuff into the agenda that they don't want on the agenda.
[02:17:23.532 --> 02:17:25.312]  And this is what I want to say about Trump.
[02:17:25.352 --> 02:17:26.952]  They've tried to emasculate us.
[02:17:26.972 --> 02:17:32.353]  They've tried to destroy the image of an aggressive, dominant male because they want a nation of servile cowards.
[02:17:32.913 --> 02:17:39.895]  And if we were already super aggressive, super male and attacking a bunch of places and, you know, doing bad things,
[02:17:40.695 --> 02:17:47.739]  Then I would sit there and say, we don't need something like this, but we have a bureaucracy that does all these bad things in our name, but then wants us weak.
[02:17:48.459 --> 02:18:00.806]  And Donald Trump clearly has the type of attitude and confidence that America needs, and he wants 10% growth rates a year, not these fake 3% that are really negative.
[02:18:01.206 --> 02:18:08.190]  He wants to have not a monopoly economy, but a big burgeoning economy, because he's made his money off of there being a wealthy economy.
[02:18:08.630 --> 02:18:10.972]  And he talks about this and he wants America to win.
[02:18:11.332 --> 02:18:18.498]  And the fact that he'd want America to win, all these politicians like Obama and others, they want to graduate up to the world government level.
[02:18:19.059 --> 02:18:27.466]  They want to be the ones that mounted America's head on the wall and made us the globalist, you know, bitch, basically, to use, you know, for lack of a better word.
[02:18:27.826 --> 02:18:29.728]  That's why they hate Trump so much.
[02:18:30.048 --> 02:18:32.810]  And he doesn't want to be part of their club.
[02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:34.492]  He builds his own clubs.
[02:18:34.992 --> 02:18:38.215]  And so that's Americana, and that's why they hate him so much.
[02:18:38.255 --> 02:18:39.777]  Is that an accurate statement, Roger Stone?
[02:18:40.258 --> 02:18:41.399]  I think that's exactly right.
[02:18:41.439 --> 02:18:46.384]  Look, Trump has built one of the great fortunes of all time, and now he wants to make the American people rich.
[02:18:46.984 --> 02:18:48.726]  Trump stands for success.
[02:18:48.766 --> 02:18:53.952]  He stands for prosperity, for full employment, for opportunity.
[02:18:54.392 --> 02:18:58.075]  This is why I think those who say, oh, he's not going to get any Hispanic votes.
[02:18:58.115 --> 02:19:00.117]  He's not going to get any African American.
[02:19:00.137 --> 02:19:01.178]  They're completely wrong.
[02:19:01.398 --> 02:19:07.743]  There are aspirational people in those groups of Americans who want a piece of the pie.
[02:19:07.783 --> 02:19:09.485]  They want their own success.
[02:19:09.945 --> 02:19:12.067]  Trump is above all a capitalist.
[02:19:12.828 --> 02:19:16.331]  And he believes that this country could be restored to greatness.
[02:19:16.371 --> 02:19:21.375]  Look, take, for example, his plan to cut the corporate tax rate, which is currently 35.
[02:19:22.856 --> 02:19:23.377]  China is 25.
[02:19:24.618 --> 02:19:26.419]  Trump would cut it to 15.
[02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:37.049]  Literally overnight, all these multinational corporations doing business in China would come home because suddenly it would be more profitable to do business here.
[02:19:37.269 --> 02:19:37.629]  Exactly.
[02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:42.774]  The globalists did that to make our jobs, the basis of them, go overseas as a plan to sabotage us.
[02:19:43.274 --> 02:19:43.754]  Exactly.
[02:19:43.854 --> 02:19:49.498]  Trump would reverse that process, and you would have one of the greatest economic booms this country has ever seen.
[02:19:49.898 --> 02:19:55.762]  There's $2 trillion offshore that's being kept offshore to avoid taxation.
[02:19:55.782 --> 02:19:58.143]  That's right, but he would make them bring that money back, and that's good.
[02:19:58.184 --> 02:19:58.584]  Stay there.
[02:19:58.824 --> 02:19:59.404]  That's important.
[02:19:59.444 --> 02:20:00.185]  Isaiah, thank you.
[02:20:00.545 --> 02:20:07.549]  Erica, Kevin, Dan, your calls are up next with Roger Stone, and I'm going to give him the floor coming up in about 20 minutes to just speechify.
[02:20:07.770 --> 02:20:08.190]  Stay with us.
[02:20:09.628 --> 02:20:13.109]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:14.370]  It's true.
[02:20:14.490 --> 02:20:18.431]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:20:18.631 --> 02:20:20.492]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:20:21.032 --> 02:20:25.494]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:20:25.814 --> 02:20:38.432]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.
[02:20:38.693 --> 02:20:42.198]  Big Berkey Water Filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[02:20:42.478 --> 02:20:44.759]  The gold standard in water purification.

[02:20:49.442 --> 02:20:50.063]  Big Berkey.
[02:20:50.263 --> 02:20:53.765]  The one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[02:20:53.965 --> 02:20:55.566]  Get your Big Berkey today.

[02:22:09.150 --> 02:22:13.953]  As your body ages, there's a 10% decline in your ability to repair each passing decade after the age 28.
[02:22:14.633 --> 02:22:20.576]  By age 40, your ability to repair from demanding manual labor, exercise, or a stressful desk job has declined by 12%.
[02:22:21.337 --> 02:22:26.120]  By using One World Whey, you supercharge your body's ability to repair and eliminate inflammation.
[02:22:26.320 --> 02:22:34.064]  Our unique, frequency-encoded whey protein, coupled with our high-quality whey, improves your cell's ability to make protein, which is to say, repair itself.
[02:22:34.144 --> 02:22:36.366]  My name is Jonathan Wright, and I'm 40 years old.
[02:22:36.466 --> 02:22:39.248]  I recently went from a desk job to a manual labor job.
[02:22:39.328 --> 02:22:40.289]  Normally, I'm worn out.
[02:22:40.429 --> 02:22:46.033]  With Energy Enhanced One World Way, I now recover so quickly that I can perform very hard work all day long.
[02:22:46.234 --> 02:22:51.338]  I use Energy Enhanced One World Way for breakfast and lunch, and I experience less hunger throughout the day.
[02:22:51.598 --> 02:22:54.440]  I have a 30% increase in energy, and I just feel better.
[02:22:54.720 --> 02:22:57.983]  I plan to make Energy Enhanced One World Way a permanent part of my lifestyle.
[02:22:58.123 --> 02:22:59.365]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.

[02:23:08.829 --> 02:23:12.533]  Did you know that home break-ins increase more than 100% during the holidays?
[02:23:12.913 --> 02:23:15.896]  It takes just 10 seconds for an intruder to kick in your door.
[02:23:16.176 --> 02:23:19.800]  But police response to a home alarm system is more than 20 minutes.
[02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:22.903]  And intruders are in and out of your home in 5 minutes.
[02:23:23.343 --> 02:23:27.427]  Thieves know that you're not home and have presence inside just waiting to be taken.
[02:23:27.868 --> 02:23:33.073]  And if you are home, how safe will you feel with an intruder lurking inside with your family?
[02:23:33.473 --> 02:23:37.396]  That's why police across the country are recommending you use door armor.
[02:23:37.737 --> 02:23:42.440]  Proven to withstand the force of a battering ram, door armor keeps intruders out.
[02:23:42.821 --> 02:23:47.565]  It's easy to install and barely visible, and your door armor is guaranteed for life.

[02:24:16.351 --> 02:24:18.053]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:24:18.093 --> 02:24:19.934]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:20.315 --> 02:24:25.240]  And the author, Roger Stone, of The Clinton's War on Women is our guest.
[02:24:26.499 --> 02:24:28.742]  But he is a bipartisan truth teller.
[02:24:29.403 --> 02:24:35.992]  He's got a new book that's bookends with it coming out on Jeb Bush and the Bush crime family.
[02:24:36.613 --> 02:24:37.695]  Bush crime syndicate.
[02:24:39.258 --> 02:24:41.320]  Put out by Sky Horse Publishing.
[02:24:42.020 --> 02:24:45.063]  We're going to go to Dan in Texas and others here in a moment, but here's some of the bad news.
[02:24:45.664 --> 02:24:48.787]  Connecticut to ban gun sales to no-fly listers.
[02:24:49.247 --> 02:24:51.369]  So that's literally lynching due process.
[02:24:51.909 --> 02:24:54.071]  The no-fly list is something to terrorize people.
[02:24:54.472 --> 02:24:56.213]  These shooters weren't on the no-fly list.
[02:24:56.233 --> 02:24:59.476]  She was allowed in without proper vetting, just as Trump has warned.
[02:25:00.677 --> 02:25:04.120]  And so now he says he's going to integrate into the no-fly list database.
[02:25:04.601 --> 02:25:05.482]  So federalizing.
[02:25:07.369 --> 02:25:08.650]  With a state executive order.
[02:25:08.690 --> 02:25:11.552]  That's totally unconstitutional, how those two things come together.
[02:25:12.072 --> 02:25:13.233]  And that's USA Today.
[02:25:13.513 --> 02:25:25.602]  How can a governor's executive order trump, no pun intended, the fact that there isn't even a federal law on this yet, but claim he's going to use a federal database at a state level to deny it?
[02:25:25.622 --> 02:25:28.684]  I mean, that violates federalism.
[02:25:28.744 --> 02:25:31.446]  It violates so many different angles of our system.
[02:25:34.136 --> 02:25:37.800]  But the people didn't even get their guns illegally and they weren't on no-fly list.
[02:25:38.620 --> 02:25:48.050]  This is so amazing that they're doing this and then they're the ones that help bring these people in and then point their finger at us.
[02:25:49.758 --> 02:25:54.063]  Mr. Stone, knowing Trump so well, obviously he's been responding to this.
[02:25:54.103 --> 02:25:56.225]  He gets more and more hardcore on the Second Amendment.
[02:25:56.866 --> 02:26:00.209]  What's your view on this and where this fight for the Second Amendment is going?
[02:26:00.249 --> 02:26:04.274]  Because I would have said this is a fraud having a state make its own law on guns, but
[02:26:05.836 --> 02:26:06.717]  It's really extraordinary.
[02:26:06.757 --> 02:26:08.979]  Look, Donald Trump is a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.
[02:26:09.019 --> 02:26:11.902]  As you know, he himself has a concealed carry permit in New York.
[02:26:26.316 --> 02:26:28.877]  He is packing heat a lot of the time.
[02:26:28.897 --> 02:26:31.037]  He's smart enough not to tell us when.
[02:26:31.438 --> 02:26:38.620]  You can imagine how many death threats he's had, not just in this campaign, but an entire career of being outspoken and being forthright.
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:49.763]  He rejects utterly the whole notion that San Bernardino could somehow have been changed or avoided if we just had more stringent gun laws.
[02:26:49.803 --> 02:26:54.544]  I thought he was masterful last night on CNN, arguing that the exact opposite was true.
[02:26:54.904 --> 02:27:00.467]  That if people in San Bernardino had been armed, some of them, the outcome might have been quite different.
[02:27:00.607 --> 02:27:04.849]  So he takes a backseat to no one in his support of the Second Amendment.
[02:27:05.569 --> 02:27:16.174]  In New Hampshire, in Iowa, in South Carolina, gun enthusiasts, firearms owners, I think, form the backbone of much of his organizational support.
[02:27:16.594 --> 02:27:23.217]  And I know that he is counting, he and his team are counting very heavily on gun owners for support in these early contests.
[02:27:23.937 --> 02:27:27.280]  I remember during that debate, he said he carries a gun, and they went, how dare you?
[02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:32.624]  You're worth billions of dollars, have death threats, El Chapo saying he wants to kill you, and you have a gun?
[02:27:32.644 --> 02:27:37.888]  But Hillary can have bodyguards, Dianne Feinstein can have a concealed carry, but not you!
[02:27:37.908 --> 02:27:41.110]  A police officer can, but not you!
[02:27:41.531 --> 02:27:42.651]  What a crazy idea!
[02:27:43.272 --> 02:27:45.674]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dan in Texas.
[02:27:45.714 --> 02:27:49.797]  You're on the air with one of his top advisors, Mr. Stone.
[02:27:51.380 --> 02:27:53.982]  Yes, Mr. Jones, Mr. Stone, it's an honor to speak with both of you.
[02:27:54.482 --> 02:27:54.922]  Go ahead, brother.
[02:27:56.063 --> 02:28:21.200]  Yes, so I know you both know that these elections are just one tool for people who want to basically write every paragraph of the history books, but constantly their plans are backfiring when you have inconvenient contingencies like Mr. Jones, your documentaries, Mr. Stone, your books that you've put out.
[02:28:21.894 --> 02:28:24.094]  Putin doing airstrikes on ISIS.
[02:28:24.735 --> 02:28:30.255]  I'll tell you why I think that the 2016 election is an uninsured liability.
[02:28:32.916 --> 02:28:50.499]  It's basically the same thing that Obama capitalized on in 2008, which is the public is so sick, to the nth degree, of these PC, milquetoast politicians, but at the same time, the public is also given pop culture
[02:28:51.368 --> 02:28:57.831]  Which gives us these figures, these rappers, these reality TV people, comedians.
[02:28:58.651 --> 02:29:02.833]  And then they're supposed to satisfy some kind of primal thing.
[02:29:02.853 --> 02:29:10.737]  And then we're told these billionaires like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, these corrupt ones, are our saviors.
[02:29:11.397 --> 02:29:15.139]  But yet all these things are supposed to be kept separate like the milk and the meat plate.
[02:29:15.419 --> 02:29:17.940]  They're never supposed to come together into a candidate.
[02:29:18.995 --> 02:29:24.217]  And so that, you know, it's just, it's so foolish for them to think that they... Exactly.
[02:29:24.257 --> 02:29:25.418]  The elites aren't gods.
[02:29:25.478 --> 02:29:26.719]  They don't control everything.
[02:29:27.119 --> 02:29:31.261]  Napoleon and Hitler thought they were invincible, but world events are turning against them.
[02:29:31.281 --> 02:29:33.201]  And that's a great place to end that call.
[02:29:33.542 --> 02:29:34.242]  We'll come back.
[02:29:35.142 --> 02:29:36.343]  I'm going to tell you about...
[02:29:37.489 --> 02:29:39.050]  Something very interesting for a few minutes.
[02:29:39.070 --> 02:29:43.953]  We're going to give Mr. Stone about a five-minute break, and then we're going to come back to him, have him comment on what you just said.
[02:29:44.073 --> 02:29:45.594]  Is history turning against the tyrants?
[02:29:45.975 --> 02:29:48.236]  Is Trump just a manifestation of that, a bellwether?
[02:29:48.256 --> 02:29:54.240]  And then we're going to give him the floor on whatever he wants to talk about, right through to the end of the hour, and more calls as well.
[02:29:54.340 --> 02:29:56.281]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[02:29:56.722 --> 02:29:59.103]  The book, The Clinton's War on Women, by Roger Stone.
[02:29:59.143 --> 02:29:59.564]  Get it today.
[02:29:59.584 --> 02:30:00.244]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.744 --> 02:30:02.345]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.286 --> 02:30:05.948]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.520 --> 02:30:10.842]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:30:11.142 --> 02:30:12.424]  You can't survive without it.
[02:30:12.624 --> 02:30:13.506]  But where do you get it?
[02:30:13.826 --> 02:30:19.594]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:30:19.815 --> 02:30:25.543]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:30:25.723 --> 02:30:42.587]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:30:42.967 --> 02:30:45.088]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:30:45.469 --> 02:30:46.649]  Stainless steel construction.

[02:31:10.185 --> 02:31:16.987]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[02:31:17.067 --> 02:31:19.768]  We've always offered five months free.
[02:31:19.949 --> 02:31:25.531]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[02:31:25.851 --> 02:31:29.032]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[02:31:29.212 --> 02:31:32.253]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[02:31:32.573 --> 02:31:34.854]  All of my documentary films, scores of
[02:31:35.134 --> 02:31:35.755]  We're good to go.
[02:31:52.512 --> 02:31:59.942]  You can also sign up for a trial month and only pay $5.95, and then 20 of you and your friends and family can watch PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:32:10.575 --> 02:32:16.818]  Chronic inflammation is now known to block your ability to repair and compromises your immune system, making you more vulnerable to all diseases.
[02:32:17.278 --> 02:32:22.240]  Since poor diet, injuries or stress are all contributing factors, many people suffer from inflammation.
[02:32:22.460 --> 02:32:27.342]  Your body's number one means of neutralizing inflammation and the pain that it may be causing is glutathione.
[02:32:27.602 --> 02:32:31.944]  Glutathione is the body's number one peptide to neutralize free radicals and thus stop inflammation.
[02:32:32.144 --> 02:32:33.745]  Hi, my name is Jason.
[02:32:33.825 --> 02:32:34.305]  I'm 44 years old.
[02:32:34.485 --> 02:32:40.709]  For 10 years I had been suffering from chronic pain in my abdomen and groin that radiated down into my feet.
[02:32:40.849 --> 02:32:48.073]  After three weeks on One World Way, the pain in my feet reduced by 50% and the overall pain in my body reduced significantly as well.
[02:32:48.193 --> 02:32:50.534]  I ran out of One World Way and the pain returned.
[02:32:50.755 --> 02:32:56.418]  I got another container and again after three weeks the pain reduced significantly throughout my body.
[02:32:56.558 --> 02:32:58.399]  I'd highly recommend One World Way to
[02:32:58.599 --> 02:33:00.621]  Fear is the passion of slaves, and this man knows no fear.
[02:33:00.661 --> 02:33:01.121]  He is Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.204 --> 02:33:27.845]  Boy, they are right in these liners now.
[02:33:27.905 --> 02:33:31.486]  I'm not, and it just sounds how heroic I am.
[02:33:32.126 --> 02:33:33.346]  Actually, I do have some fear.
[02:33:33.486 --> 02:33:37.307]  A fear of letting these tyrants rule my life and dominate and totally control me.
[02:33:38.248 --> 02:33:39.128]  It's fight and flight.
[02:33:39.208 --> 02:33:40.008]  I've decided to fight.
[02:33:40.068 --> 02:33:41.229]  So has our guest, Roger Stone.
[02:33:41.269 --> 02:33:41.569]  And listen...
[02:33:43.004 --> 02:33:58.134]  I can't sit here and be wishy-wash in a key election like this and be political like everybody else and just sit back and join the big pillory throwing tomatoes at Donald Trump in the proverbial stocks all tied up in the town square.
[02:33:59.015 --> 02:33:59.955]  He may not be perfect.
[02:34:00.396 --> 02:34:03.538]  I may be wrong about all this, but they're all piling on.
[02:34:03.678 --> 02:34:04.838]  What he's saying is true.
[02:34:05.299 --> 02:34:06.439]  He's being demonized.
[02:34:06.500 --> 02:34:08.201]  He's not playing politics as usual.
[02:34:09.722 --> 02:34:10.342]  That's why I am
[02:34:12.901 --> 02:34:16.986]  Supporting Trump and his message against the establishment.
[02:34:17.888 --> 02:34:30.024]  Because regardless, the things he's saying about our open borders, about gun control, about Islamic terrorism, about taking on ISIS, about taxing the big megabanks, but then also setting it up with lower tax rates so they bring their money back here.
[02:34:31.766 --> 02:34:37.508]  They'll probably have a MSNBC piece go, lower their taxes to tax them to bring it back here.
[02:34:37.568 --> 02:34:40.869]  Yes, they're basically tax exempt the way it's set up right now.
[02:34:40.909 --> 02:34:42.330]  That's why they wrote these laws.
[02:34:43.130 --> 02:34:44.371]  So that's why.
[02:34:45.330 --> 02:34:48.673]  More and more, I'm supporting Donald Trump, just in his message, period.
[02:34:49.154 --> 02:34:52.537]  I'd be happy with a Ted Cruz, a Rand Paul, a Donald Trump, or a mix of those.
[02:34:53.418 --> 02:34:56.801]  But right now, he is the major frontrunner, gaining steam.
[02:34:57.081 --> 02:34:59.363]  The book, The Clinton's War on Women, Roger Stone.
[02:35:00.284 --> 02:35:04.288]  Now, before we go any further, I don't really know of CJ's view completely on Trump.
[02:35:04.588 --> 02:35:06.890]  He's been working here for three or four years, doing a great job.
[02:35:07.861 --> 02:35:08.282]  We're good to go.
[02:35:21.775 --> 02:35:25.816]  Just the best vetted technology in solar panels for the price.
[02:35:25.836 --> 02:35:28.117]  We can give you a wide shot of it if you're a TV viewer.
[02:35:28.457 --> 02:35:31.857]  Infowars.com forward slash show if you're a radio listener and want to see this.
[02:35:32.538 --> 02:35:42.500]  But whether it's for your hunting shack or part of your house or for your fishing cottage, whatever the case is, it is mobile like a suitcase.
[02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:43.360]  You can roll around.
[02:35:44.280 --> 02:35:45.981]  It's got the solar panels that come with it.
[02:35:46.829 --> 02:36:01.502]  And the price, from what I've seen when I agreed to order these months ago and do this deal, is roughly half of the competitor, and they don't even have as much power, and it's not even the best solar panels, it's just people keep selling the stuff that's ten years old.
[02:36:02.083 --> 02:36:12.412]  This is the latest, greatest for the price, and if this is successful, which I believe it will be, it'll become a staple of preparedness products that we sell at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:36:13.433 --> 02:36:17.216]  But it is the Infowar Solar Base Station Power Supply.
[02:36:17.816 --> 02:36:20.938]  And CJ, who's a big fan of it, is here.
[02:36:20.978 --> 02:36:22.419]  He volunteered to come in and talk about it.
[02:36:22.679 --> 02:36:28.823]  CJ, also David Knight ran in and pointed out, you can get a federal tax credit for this system.
[02:36:29.544 --> 02:36:34.107]  So describe to us why you're such a fan of the Infowar Solar Base Station Power Supply.
[02:36:35.445 --> 02:36:39.368]  Most importantly, the benefits, I think, outweigh even the cost of this.
[02:36:39.608 --> 02:36:57.843]  Tim Fergé had recommended I speak about this, because I've had some experience building homebrew solar systems, essentially to supplement electrical costs, and it's always been a lot more work than I felt it was worth, simply because of the cost of the panels, the technology lagging behind, in order to get
[02:36:58.684 --> 02:37:00.624]  Excellent panels of the greatest quality.
[02:37:00.804 --> 02:37:03.425]  You need to look at products years in advance.
[02:37:04.005 --> 02:37:14.227]  And I think what's great about this is it's a monocrystalline panel instead of polycrystalline panels, which are simply separate pieces of material that absorb light and convert it to energy.
[02:37:14.627 --> 02:37:16.727]  This is similar to perfect surface copper.
[02:37:17.507 --> 02:37:24.348]  In electrical terms, you get more energy or more efficiency out of a smoother surface.
[02:37:24.448 --> 02:37:27.049]  And so the panels themselves are fantastic.
[02:37:27.509 --> 02:37:28.069]  They're rugged.
[02:37:28.089 --> 02:37:32.812]  They've got what looks to be extruded aluminum protecting them.
[02:37:33.293 --> 02:37:34.193]  They'll fold in half.
[02:37:34.934 --> 02:37:37.235]  It's about the size of a large slim suitcase.
[02:37:37.475 --> 02:37:40.317]  The company that's welding these wants to take over the market.
[02:37:40.357 --> 02:37:41.398]  They don't want to put crap out.
[02:37:41.727 --> 02:37:42.067]  Not at all.
[02:37:42.627 --> 02:37:44.989]  Similar pieces of equipment go for about $5,000.
[02:37:45.409 --> 02:37:50.311]  So when I say it's half the cost, it's way, way less than half.
[02:37:50.712 --> 02:37:52.412]  It's quite a bit less than half.
[02:37:52.813 --> 02:37:54.333]  To get something of similar value.
[02:37:54.433 --> 02:37:57.575]  And I don't believe they're all implementing these batteries.
[02:37:58.495 --> 02:38:03.238]  The quality of the batteries I think is fantastic because it's a lithium iron.
[02:38:04.099 --> 02:38:12.827]  It's going to last a lot longer than a lithium polymer or a conventional lithium ion.
[02:38:13.888 --> 02:38:24.057]  Its discharge rate is going to be a little bit slower, but because of what it is and because of the durability, you get a lot more charges and discharges out of this kind of cell.
[02:38:25.098 --> 02:38:25.659]  I believe it's up to 2,000.
[02:38:27.500 --> 02:38:31.882]  Let's just be clear, there's only 98 of these, I should say, because I'm getting two of them myself.
[02:38:32.702 --> 02:38:39.245]  You've got to have one in your house as backup and also one portable when you go camping or whatever.
[02:38:39.385 --> 02:38:42.187]  I keep using the term because that's what I tell my guys.
[02:38:42.327 --> 02:38:43.347]  I want game changers.
[02:38:43.747 --> 02:38:48.029]  I want the best reviewed, highest quality, bang for your buck, companies that are aggressive
[02:38:48.049 --> 02:38:48.669]  We're good to go.
[02:39:15.638 --> 02:39:17.380]  I immediately thought of my grandmother when I saw it.
[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:26.289]  She lives in a very rural area, has COPD, has an oxygen machine, has a CPAP, and a nebulizer.
[02:39:26.670 --> 02:39:28.712]  And when the power goes out, they do have a generator.
[02:39:29.192 --> 02:39:34.337]  It's noisy, but it relies on a steady supply of gasoline, and if you're snowed in and you can't get that,
[02:39:35.137 --> 02:39:45.664]  The sun is still there, and what makes it great is that even in overcast situations, like you'll find in winter, it's going to absorb almost as much as a conventional solar panel on a cloudy day.
[02:39:46.185 --> 02:39:46.405]  Wow.
[02:39:46.885 --> 02:39:51.769]  Other specs about the new Infowar Solar Base Station Power Supply at InfowarStore.com.
[02:39:53.344 --> 02:39:56.225]  Along with an AC outlet, you've got 12-volt outlets.
[02:39:56.705 --> 02:40:01.367]  12 volts at, I believe, 20 amps, so you can charge a car.
[02:40:01.907 --> 02:40:10.951]  If you don't have a portable charger, and you have this in your car, for example, while traveling, going hunting, camping, fishing, and you need to charge a battery, it's capable of that.
[02:40:11.391 --> 02:40:18.894]  It does come with that LED work lamp, which in the event of darkness, you've got a full battery and you need to work on something.
[02:40:19.694 --> 02:40:20.675]  You've got light available.
[02:40:20.695 --> 02:40:26.878]  And a lot of the panels fold together and fit so nicely for transportability as well.
[02:40:27.299 --> 02:40:27.879]  And durability.
[02:40:28.619 --> 02:40:29.980]  It's got a protective casing around it.
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:33.362]  Most of the panels that I've purchased in the past were very fragile.
[02:40:33.542 --> 02:40:39.265]  You basically set them up somewhere and try not to touch them again because they're subject to cracking.
[02:40:39.806 --> 02:40:42.007]  This is very, very sturdy.
[02:40:44.042 --> 02:40:47.368]  Well I hope that you'll work with the guys since you're so knowledgeable about this.
[02:40:48.370 --> 02:40:56.704]  I know Tim spent years, for years I said get me the best small portable solar unit and we would just look at reviews or find out what we could get and it just
[02:40:58.436 --> 02:41:00.317]  It just had too many problems, too many issues.
[02:41:00.337 --> 02:41:04.559]  We finally found something that I can really get behind, and the price is so low.
[02:41:04.899 --> 02:41:05.940]  It's so high quality.
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:11.602]  For people that want to really have portable power, these are amazing units.
[02:41:11.662 --> 02:41:14.904]  And it's something not just for preparedness, but just for everyday life.
[02:41:15.604 --> 02:41:17.465]  It's very, very, very, very exciting.
[02:41:17.865 --> 02:41:18.125]  It is.
[02:41:18.505 --> 02:41:24.287]  For everyday life, you can put one of these in your house, and in some states, you qualify for a tax credit up to 30% of the cost.
[02:41:25.127 --> 02:41:30.568]  Some states would require that you somehow permanently attach it or hire an electrician to run the leads in.
[02:41:30.628 --> 02:41:37.330]  It's not necessary for safety to hire an electrician for the DC leads, being that it's DC low voltage, it's not a huge fire risk.
[02:41:37.390 --> 02:41:41.511]  But in order to qualify for a tax credit, you may want to look into it, contact an accountant.
[02:41:41.671 --> 02:41:44.792]  But even for home use, if you'd like to shave maybe a few
[02:41:46.392 --> 02:41:49.714]  Dozen dollars off of your electric bill, I think it would be quite effective.
[02:41:50.555 --> 02:41:51.375]  Absolutely so.
[02:41:51.695 --> 02:41:54.317]  If you did use this over a year or so, you'd get your money back.
[02:41:55.277 --> 02:41:55.858]  More than likely.
[02:41:56.178 --> 02:41:57.659]  You'd certainly get the peace of mind back.
[02:41:57.799 --> 02:41:58.899]  That's certain.
[02:41:59.780 --> 02:42:04.383]  I think it's the most innovative thing we've decided to release in our store since the G-Shock watches.
[02:42:05.259 --> 02:42:07.301]  I carry one because we work in broadcast.
[02:42:07.461 --> 02:42:08.401]  Well, that's a no-brainer.
[02:42:08.421 --> 02:42:11.844]  I mean, they're really high-quality watches that are super tough and everybody loves.
[02:42:11.944 --> 02:42:12.824]  It's military-grade.
[02:42:12.864 --> 02:42:15.847]  It receives perfect time, six times a day, shortwave.
[02:42:16.367 --> 02:42:18.729]  And I feel naked without it being in radio.
[02:42:20.054 --> 02:42:22.595]  And all the Special Forces guys have them because they are the best.
[02:42:22.615 --> 02:42:24.396]  We have them discounted at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:42:24.776 --> 02:42:26.517]  And it is your purchasing that makes it all possible.
[02:42:26.537 --> 02:42:29.858]  We have free shipping in the store until December 18th.
[02:42:29.898 --> 02:42:35.361]  And we've got a bunch of specials running right now at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:42:35.681 --> 02:42:41.564]  But this is definitely a great Christmas gift to your family, to yourself, to your loved ones, and to others.
[02:42:41.604 --> 02:42:44.105]  But I mean, obviously, you don't want to buy this for your son or daughter if they're not
[02:42:44.625 --> 02:42:49.569]  Somewhat technical, it's super easy to use, but, you know, people aren't into this type of stuff and you probably don't want to give it to them.
[02:42:49.589 --> 02:42:55.054]  But how many people do you know that are into preparedness or are into hunting or are into being off the grid?
[02:42:55.634 --> 02:43:01.058]  This really is innovative and it's great to see the technology getting better and better and so much more stable.
[02:43:01.439 --> 02:43:06.323]  The system is really worried about ubiquitous use of solar panels as they get better and better coming out.
[02:43:06.343 --> 02:43:10.126]  That's why they're trying to force people to dial them in to the central power grid.
[02:43:11.206 --> 02:43:12.888]  So they can control the whole thing.
[02:43:13.368 --> 02:43:14.849]  This is about decentralization.
[02:43:15.129 --> 02:43:16.130]  CJ, thank you so much.
[02:43:16.150 --> 02:43:16.611]  You're welcome.
[02:43:16.631 --> 02:43:16.871]  Thank you.
[02:43:16.891 --> 02:43:18.492]  All right, there goes CJ, folks.
[02:43:18.512 --> 02:43:24.216]  We're going to go back now to our guest, the Clemson's War on Women, Roger Stone.
[02:43:25.657 --> 02:43:32.322]  And we're going to be getting him on to talk more about that and to talk about the callers' last question.
[02:43:33.563 --> 02:43:36.926]  Is there a major political realignment happening?
[02:43:37.106 --> 02:43:37.887]  And we do know
[02:43:38.487 --> 02:43:43.996]  That there is a major political realignment that is taking place.
[02:43:45.539 --> 02:43:51.669]  And so everything we see out there is about scrambling political discourse, creating racial and religious divisions.
[02:43:53.451 --> 02:43:54.692]  To keep all that stirred up.
[02:43:55.293 --> 02:43:57.434]  So going back to Roger Stone.
[02:43:57.514 --> 02:43:58.955]  Roger, you heard the caller earlier.
[02:43:58.975 --> 02:44:06.219]  He was saying he thinks that the political elite now used to have the Midas touch because they had America's goodwill behind us.
[02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:11.022]  They had the world believing what we said even if we weren't perfect.
[02:44:11.322 --> 02:44:16.425]  We've lost that moral high ground now and the world doesn't believe our elite even when they tell the truth.
[02:44:17.006 --> 02:44:18.947]  But that old quote, I forget who said it,
[02:44:20.908 --> 02:44:23.651]  For who the gods would destroy, they would first make man.
[02:44:24.492 --> 02:44:32.720]  And I know that's kind of attributed to a lot of different historians, but it does seem as if our elite are degenerating quickly.
[02:44:32.760 --> 02:44:44.251]  Can you speak to the political climate worldwide as an expert, as an advisor to so many presidents, and where you see the world going, and what you would expect Donald Trump to do if he was elected president?
[02:44:45.506 --> 02:44:46.807]  Well, this is pretty simple.
[02:44:46.867 --> 02:44:56.391]  The countries around the world are looking to see whether we're going to continue to be patsies, whether we're going to be China's bitch when it comes to trade, or Japan's, or Mexico.
[02:44:57.052 --> 02:45:01.014]  They're going to see if our military is going to continue to be allowed to atrophy.
[02:45:02.574 --> 02:45:05.195]  And get to the point where we can barely defend ourselves.
[02:45:05.235 --> 02:45:11.458]  They're going to see whether this printing press monetary system of ours will continue to destroy our dollar.
[02:45:11.918 --> 02:45:17.541]  They're going to see whether we are going to continue to go deeper and deeper and deeper into debt.
[02:45:18.041 --> 02:45:21.284]  They're going to see whether we keep spending like drunken sailors.
[02:45:21.304 --> 02:45:23.586]  And by the way, here's a bipartisan problem.
[02:45:23.646 --> 02:45:26.649]  Republicans and Democrats together, responsible.
[02:45:26.669 --> 02:45:35.496]  When the Republicans held the House under George W. Bush and a Republican administration, their record on spending would make Franklin Roosevelt blush.
[02:45:36.778 --> 02:45:41.001]  So it is, you know, there is disgust with the two-party system.
[02:45:41.061 --> 02:45:42.543]  On the other hand, Alex, I must tell you,
[02:45:43.223 --> 02:45:54.010]  I was very proud to say that I helped former Governor Gary Johnson, who I know has been on with you many times, get on the ballot in 48 states because the American people were ready for something new.
[02:45:54.451 --> 02:46:01.415]  70% of the people in the polls in that election told us that they wish there was another choice, and of course there was another choice.
[02:46:02.036 --> 02:46:08.260]  It was the two-term, accomplished, tax-cutting, pro-growth, pro-peace, pro-pot,
[02:46:09.898 --> 02:46:24.890]  Governor of New Mexico, and of course the Presidential Commission on Debates, which is not appointed by the President, not a commission, and most certainly not about debate, was determined to keep this man off the stage.
[02:46:25.670 --> 02:46:30.374]  What if people knew there was a candidate who wanted to repeal the Patriot Act?
[02:46:30.774 --> 02:46:35.137]  Or who wanted to bring all of our troops home from Afghanistan?
[02:46:35.177 --> 02:46:35.898]  The meat grinder.
[02:46:36.979 --> 02:46:39.501]  Who wanted to legalize marijuana and tax it.
[02:46:41.068 --> 02:46:43.351]  What would have happened if people knew that guy was in the race?
[02:46:43.371 --> 02:46:45.253]  So I'm very jaundiced about the system.
[02:46:45.654 --> 02:46:50.500]  Trump has chosen to make his stand within the Republican Party, and I am with him.
[02:46:51.481 --> 02:46:55.446]  And if he is the Republican nominee, I'm going to do everything personally possible.
[02:46:55.466 --> 02:46:56.747]  I want to be very clear.
[02:46:56.868 --> 02:47:00.151]  I have no formal or informal role in his campaign.
[02:47:00.692 --> 02:47:01.532]  We are friends.
[02:47:02.113 --> 02:47:02.893]  It's that simple.
[02:47:03.073 --> 02:47:04.174]  I am not compensated.
[02:47:04.734 --> 02:47:11.877]  I'm very interested in selling the Clinton's war on women because I think it is the information, Alex, that Trump is going to need.
[02:47:11.917 --> 02:47:18.340]  I think there's several ways to take Hillary down, and that's a whole broader discussion that you and I need to have.
[02:47:18.941 --> 02:47:25.764]  I want you to get into any other facets we haven't raised, obviously, because I've been directing things, and you've got a lot more gravitas on the political inside workings.
[02:47:25.784 --> 02:47:27.625]  I'd like to hear that with your perspective.
[02:47:27.665 --> 02:47:29.786]  But separately, let's expand on this.
[02:47:30.726 --> 02:47:38.995]  My big fear has always been, and I believe you Offair and others saying no Trump probably won't do that, but the Republicans have betrayed him.
[02:47:39.395 --> 02:47:42.098]  He said as long as the Republicans don't attack me and don't demonize me.
[02:47:43.217 --> 02:47:43.597]  We're good to go.
[02:48:05.066 --> 02:48:12.589]  I know he's probably just trying to leverage him, correct me if I'm wrong, but he shouldn't let them kick him out or run him out.
[02:48:13.469 --> 02:48:15.650]  What is Trump really saying about that?
[02:48:15.710 --> 02:48:16.810]  I mean, what's the real Trump going to do?
[02:48:16.850 --> 02:48:20.451]  I think it's very unlikely that he will have to run as an independent.
[02:48:20.631 --> 02:48:22.332]  Therefore, when people ask me about it,
[02:48:23.772 --> 02:48:27.354]  It's a it's a it's a it's a MacGuffin in all honesty at this point.
[02:48:27.815 --> 02:48:31.597]  Does he have the name ID and the financial resources to do that?
[02:48:31.697 --> 02:48:32.017]  Yes.
[02:48:32.177 --> 02:48:38.000]  So let's put it in perspective because my friend Richard Reeves is I think very concerned about this.
[02:48:38.501 --> 02:48:47.386]  If they play the kind of shenanigans with the rules at the convention or in any part of the process that they used to cheat
[02:48:48.326 --> 02:49:01.374]  Ron Paul, out of his fair share of delegates and his say at the convention, where he was a non-person, they wouldn't even call his name in the role, the official role of the convention, even when he had legally won delegates.
[02:49:02.194 --> 02:49:07.918]  What kind of graciousness is that on the part of Mitt Romney, who had the votes to be nominated at that time?
[02:49:08.518 --> 02:49:16.023]  If they move to keep Trump out of the debates, if they move to keep him off the ballot, which some Republican Secretary of State
[02:49:16.963 --> 02:49:17.543]  Can do.
[02:49:18.064 --> 02:49:31.173]  Then I think under that circumstances, it may be the only route for him to the White House, and therefore, in my opinion, to the potential salvation of this country, because no one else is going to really change things.
[02:49:31.813 --> 02:49:42.941]  The two-party duopoly, the Bush-Clinton war machine, profiteering machine, will continue to try to curtail our civil liberties and make money off of them.
[02:49:43.121 --> 02:49:44.664]  I am now completely sold.
[02:49:44.784 --> 02:49:47.608]  I mean, Mr. Stone, you always have the right answer.
[02:49:47.648 --> 02:49:49.111]  You've backed so many great candidates.
[02:49:49.632 --> 02:49:51.314]  It's so good to see a political analyst.
[02:49:52.856 --> 02:49:54.416]  Who actually is telling the truth.
[02:49:54.957 --> 02:49:55.377]  That's it.
[02:49:55.757 --> 02:50:01.638]  The only time Trump should run third party is if they cheat him in the delegate process and have Jeb Bush in there.
[02:50:01.978 --> 02:50:04.579]  Then who wouldn't want Trump to run?
[02:50:04.679 --> 02:50:06.139]  Fine, Hillary or Jeb.
[02:50:06.699 --> 02:50:08.360]  It's time to go after both of them.
[02:50:08.420 --> 02:50:09.740]  You've got the books out on them.
[02:50:10.180 --> 02:50:11.600]  I kind of see a pincer attack here.
[02:50:11.620 --> 02:50:17.102]  I kind of see some planning behind the scenes that will really give them a run for their money.
[02:50:17.442 --> 02:50:22.163]  And it's good to see some guys with brains, you and Trump, really giving these criminals a run for their money.
[02:50:23.100 --> 02:50:27.005]  Well, look, I think Hillary Clinton is going to be very, very formidable, Alex.
[02:50:27.406 --> 02:50:30.369]  And she's going to have an enormous amount of Wall Street money.
[02:50:31.010 --> 02:50:34.435]  The idea of her ever reigning in Wall Street is laughable.
[02:50:35.676 --> 02:50:41.183]  And she and her husband have many, many, let's call them assets in the media.
[02:50:42.044 --> 02:50:51.149]  Who are, you know, who go to great lengths to cover up all of their blemishes, their many blemishes, in their outright criminal record.
[02:50:51.249 --> 02:50:59.714]  Their record of lies, deception, drugs, sexual assault, cover-up, lies upon more lies upon more lies.
[02:51:00.154 --> 02:51:07.578]  Only today I saw a video in which Hillary Clinton is now attempting to say that she never claimed
[02:51:09.349 --> 02:51:19.175]  That an anti-Islamic video shown one time in Turkey had caused the attack on the American mission in Benghazi.
[02:51:19.676 --> 02:51:21.857]  I wrote a book on this for Skyhorse.
[02:51:21.897 --> 02:51:28.121]  It's a short book, but if you want to know what Hillary did wrong in Benghazi, go to Amazon and buy my book on Benghazi.
[02:51:28.141 --> 02:51:29.182]  I took the Senate report.
[02:51:29.862 --> 02:51:34.764]  But I gave you a roadmap up front that explained what the Senate report was saying and what it showed you.
[02:51:35.184 --> 02:51:38.226]  I think it makes the case that Hillary lied about that.
[02:51:38.246 --> 02:51:53.793]  Now she's out on the campaign trail and she says to her stooge, George Stephanopoulos, donor to the Clinton Foundation, but interviewing her on television, therefore posing as a journalist, when she's asked, did you say that this was tied to a video, she said, no.
[02:51:55.677 --> 02:51:57.358]  That's a horrific lie.
[02:51:57.378 --> 02:52:00.780]  That's as bad as Obama saying he never said that you could keep your doctor.
[02:52:00.800 --> 02:52:02.941]  I mean, this is a new level of lying.
[02:52:03.442 --> 02:52:14.788]  No, no, and the families for the four immediately contacted the parents of the four brave Americans who were murdered in Benghazi and lost their lives.
[02:52:15.749 --> 02:52:19.831]  The parents are outraged because that is not what she looked in the eye and told them.
[02:52:20.271 --> 02:52:24.274]  So we know everybody had this great celebration about her hearings.
[02:52:25.393 --> 02:52:28.074]  And how terrific how she was before the Senate.
[02:52:29.134 --> 02:52:31.995]  I think that that is not true.
[02:52:32.055 --> 02:52:35.056]  I think that she was caught in more and more big lies.
[02:52:35.176 --> 02:52:42.539]  For example, this notion that she emailed the Egyptian ambassador and her own daughter, Chelsea,
[02:52:44.263 --> 02:53:01.905]  After the attack saying we've been attacked by Al-Qaeda, when she's telling the world this cover story about an Islamic video, which is essentially a cover-up because they didn't want to admit in the run-up to the presidential election that was only weeks away, that they had
[02:53:02.506 --> 02:53:04.088]  I don't think so.
[02:53:18.743 --> 02:53:19.644]  of the establishment.
[02:53:19.684 --> 02:53:21.225]  This is how Bush runs against Clinton.
[02:53:21.645 --> 02:53:23.246]  It's not Republican-Democrat.
[02:53:23.806 --> 02:53:27.008]  It's their different factions of an aristocracy.
[02:53:27.148 --> 02:53:30.691]  Yeah, it's like the Harvard lacrosse team playing the other Harvard lacrosse team.
[02:53:31.111 --> 02:53:33.653]  Well, the Rockefellers and the Kennedys both wanted power.
[02:53:33.733 --> 02:53:34.873]  They wanted to be the guy.
[02:53:34.913 --> 02:53:37.935]  Don't think that they weren't fighting inside the club.
[02:53:38.936 --> 02:53:45.941]  And the guys in the club like Henry Luce and Tom Dewey and other kingmakers are choosing sides.
[02:53:46.981 --> 02:53:49.564]  April Harriman, Prescott Bush.
[02:54:11.465 --> 02:54:13.386]  And he told me just this morning that he doesn't care.
[02:54:13.406 --> 02:54:18.007]  I mean, this shows... I said, Donald, this has got to be hurting your bottom line.
[02:54:18.067 --> 02:54:21.909]  He said, yeah, I've had some deals go south, but you know, I don't really care.
[02:54:23.029 --> 02:54:27.511]  This guy's a patriot, and he sees that this country desperately needs leadership.
[02:54:28.471 --> 02:54:33.953]  He knows that the career politicians are never going to do anything other than talk.
[02:54:34.354 --> 02:54:40.276]  Trump has a can-do confidence that people haven't seen since... Well, he clearly loves the fight.
[02:54:41.161 --> 02:54:42.522]  He's having the time of his life.
[02:54:42.803 --> 02:54:47.787]  You know, watching him be silly and stuff on other TV shows, entertainment, you know, it's just, you know, he's having fun.
[02:54:47.807 --> 02:54:54.874]  But once he gets in the fight, you can really see that it's just good to see that male stamina.
[02:54:55.334 --> 02:55:02.321]  You know, not the fake slimy type we normally see, but the real deal, loving the fight, not caring, committed to the fight, not worried if he gets caught up.
[02:55:02.921 --> 02:55:03.922]  That's why they're so scared of him.
[02:55:03.942 --> 02:55:04.322]  It's beautiful.
[02:55:04.343 --> 02:55:05.584]  I want to take a few phone calls here.
[02:55:06.024 --> 02:55:08.565]  We got Kevin, Jeff, Erica, Monique in Canada.
[02:55:09.146 --> 02:55:10.186]  Kevin and so many others.
[02:55:10.887 --> 02:55:13.788]  Let's go to Monique in Canada.
[02:55:14.069 --> 02:55:16.050]  Monique, you're on the air with Roger Stone.
[02:55:16.070 --> 02:55:16.430]  Go ahead.
[02:55:17.550 --> 02:55:26.315]  Hi, I'm reading many of your channels and different channels because I'm on defending the kids for the books they're pushing in the schools.
[02:55:26.415 --> 02:55:26.656]  Yes.
[02:55:26.896 --> 02:55:30.838]  I even had a legal restriction on me given one year because I complained
[02:55:31.368 --> 02:55:34.149]  Books that were for 12 plus give in to 9 years old.
[02:55:34.809 --> 02:55:38.470]  So... Yeah, Canada under political correctness has a lot of censorship.
[02:55:38.490 --> 02:55:41.231]  What's your take on the Donald Trump situation?
[02:55:41.591 --> 02:55:44.812]  I'm reading about lots in the French media and stuff.
[02:55:45.152 --> 02:55:56.876]  They're pushing that there's an international boycott of protest organizing against Trump because they're pushing, the media are pushing that Trump
[02:55:58.673 --> 02:56:08.261]  Yes, there is a global movement now by the socialists and the big billionaires to crush Donald Trump.
[02:56:15.026 --> 02:56:23.812]  Alex, I frankly think that the fundamental question here is they're trying to, this canard that Trump is somehow recruited by Bill Clinton and in league with the Clintons
[02:56:41.525 --> 02:56:50.012]  I can tell you, having known him this long and having been around and witnessed firsthand, by the way, Hillary wanted to come to Donald's wedding.
[02:56:50.493 --> 02:56:55.417]  Her staff tried to overrule her and she insisted on coming to Donald's wedding.
[02:56:56.098 --> 02:56:59.240]  He is the wealthiest man in the state of New York, most likely.
[02:56:59.661 --> 02:57:00.481]  She was the U.S.
[02:57:00.522 --> 02:57:02.703]  Senator from New York.
[02:57:05.165 --> 02:57:09.269]  You can imagine the glitterati that was at Trump's wedding.
[02:57:09.909 --> 02:57:11.390]  So she wanted to attend.
[02:57:11.451 --> 02:57:13.893]  Hillary, there were some hot chicks there.
[02:57:13.973 --> 02:57:19.917]  No, I'm sure it was a CNBC thing and Hillary went because it was a political coup for her.
[02:57:20.258 --> 02:57:22.399]  Trump is a very popular man in his home state.
[02:57:23.821 --> 02:57:28.867]  So, but the notion that he is in the tank, which Jeb is trying to push, that's nonsense.
[02:57:29.327 --> 02:57:36.696]  The other notion that I think is similar, of course, is that some people draw parallels between Ross Perot and Trump.
[02:57:36.776 --> 02:57:43.023]  I knew Perot, and I knew his people, and I think they put on a very valiant fight with a lot of amateurs.
[02:57:44.244 --> 02:57:48.507]  But, Perot, as you know, threatened the status quo, as Trump did.
[02:57:48.908 --> 02:57:51.830]  He was an independent billionaire, as Trump is.
[02:57:52.350 --> 02:57:54.471]  He would have brought real reform to Washington.
[02:57:54.531 --> 02:57:58.714]  He was neither left nor right in the sense that he was a populist with conservative instincts.
[02:57:58.734 --> 02:58:00.856]  But they threatened to kill his family, so he got out.
[02:58:01.356 --> 02:58:01.996]  So he folded.
[02:58:03.017 --> 02:58:03.838]  Trump wouldn't do that.
[02:58:04.418 --> 02:58:05.759]  I can't see Trump doing that.
[02:58:05.839 --> 02:58:08.802]  Trump is, he's already got Secret Service protection.
[02:58:09.762 --> 02:58:17.008]  He is, along with Ben Carson, because they are controversial figures, and that is appointed by the President.
[02:58:18.049 --> 02:58:21.392]  They have their own personal security, which we of course cannot talk about.
[02:58:22.512 --> 02:58:24.013]  But Trump's not a quitter.
[02:58:24.313 --> 02:58:25.233]  He's not a folder.
[02:58:25.753 --> 02:58:29.135]  And he certainly won't be bullied out of this race.
[02:58:29.155 --> 02:58:36.437]  He's a shrewd individual and he will assess the race and he will be a candidate as long as he is viable.
[02:58:36.658 --> 02:58:38.918]  I frankly think that he will win before that time.
[02:58:38.938 --> 02:58:40.439]  I hope that's the case.
[02:58:40.459 --> 02:58:41.199]  I know you've got to go soon.
[02:58:41.219 --> 02:58:42.300]  Do five more minutes with us.
[02:58:42.720 --> 02:58:44.801]  RogerStone, StoneZone.com.
[02:58:44.941 --> 02:58:45.481]  Get the book.
[02:58:45.861 --> 02:58:49.682]  I want to ask you why he thinks, with the numbers, why he thinks Trump can win.
[02:58:49.923 --> 02:58:50.563]  This is important.
[02:58:50.583 --> 02:58:50.903]  Stay with us.

[02:58:55.349 --> 02:58:56.851]  Finlay and Maggot is coming up!
[02:58:59.602 --> 02:59:03.045]  Thanks to the Federal Reserve System, America's economy is in a terminal decline.
[02:59:03.285 --> 02:59:08.349]  And according to economic expert Michael Snyder, here's 8 facts that reveal just how bad the economy really is.
[02:59:08.609 --> 02:59:08.829]  Number 1.
[02:59:09.009 --> 02:59:13.392]  The majority of all American workers bring home less than $30,000 a year in wages.
[02:59:13.713 --> 02:59:14.193]  Number 2.
[02:59:14.413 --> 02:59:18.737]  The poorest 40% of all Americans now spend most of their incomes just on food and housing.
[02:59:18.977 --> 02:59:19.457]  Number 3.
[02:59:19.697 --> 02:59:24.161]  At least 50% of Americans who rent their homes spend more than a third of their incomes on the rent.
[02:59:24.341 --> 02:59:24.861]  Number 4.
[02:59:25.161 --> 02:59:27.743]  Incomes keep declining for a large majority of the U.S.
[02:59:27.783 --> 02:59:28.324]  population.
[02:59:28.604 --> 02:59:28.824]  Number 5.
[02:59:29.464 --> 02:59:31.805]  The price of ground beef has more than doubled since 2009.
[02:59:32.245 --> 02:59:33.045]  Number 6.
[02:59:33.706 --> 02:59:35.326]  The rate of home ownership in the U.S.
[02:59:35.346 --> 02:59:37.467]  has been declining for at least 7 years in a row.
[02:59:37.627 --> 02:59:39.967]  It's now the lowest that it's been in 20 years.
[02:59:40.228 --> 02:59:40.468]  Number 7.
[02:59:41.088 --> 02:59:47.510]  Almost half of all Americans are not saving their money, and it's been estimated that 62% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
[02:59:47.690 --> 02:59:47.910]  Number 8.
[02:59:48.510 --> 02:59:52.173]  One-third of all Americans with student loans are currently behind on their student loan debt.
[02:59:52.253 --> 02:59:57.597]  Check out InfoWars.com for more economic news and also our new YouTube channel, Resistance News.
[02:59:57.717 --> 02:59:58.978]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[03:00:01.940 --> 03:00:06.444]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.549 --> 03:00:15.091]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:19.497 --> 03:00:20.918]  We've got a poll at InfoWars.com with 27,000 plus voters.
[03:00:20.978 --> 03:00:23.740]  When it comes to world affairs, how do you think 2016 will turn out compared to 2015?
[03:00:23.780 --> 03:00:25.301]  89%, that's how I voted, I didn't know the results.
[03:00:25.321 --> 03:00:26.082]  I just voted.
[03:00:26.102 --> 03:00:27.563]  89% believe worse, 24,000 plus people. 1,892
[03:00:42.134 --> 03:00:46.979]  Uh, say that, um, it's gonna be the same, or 7%, 4% think better.
[03:00:47.359 --> 03:00:48.180]  They think it's gonna get better.
[03:00:48.200 --> 03:00:52.944]  Well, I hope the 4% are right, but me guts tell me it's gonna be quite a rollercoaster.
[03:00:53.005 --> 03:01:00.952]  Let's go to this piece, uh, put out by the Change the Channel fella, Kenneth Webb, uh, his analysis of Obama's speech.
[03:01:01.172 --> 03:01:06.898]  We're posting all of this right now to InfoWars.com so you can carry the ball and spread these videos to others.
[03:01:08.480 --> 03:01:10.443]  Man, oh man, the madness never ends!
[03:01:10.603 --> 03:01:11.283]  Yes, we can.
[03:01:11.364 --> 03:01:12.345]  Barack would've cried.
[03:01:12.425 --> 03:01:17.570]  Obama addressed the nation on Sunday night about keeping our nation safe from ISIL.
[03:01:17.751 --> 03:01:17.991]  ISIS.
[03:01:18.031 --> 03:01:19.473]  Whatever they're calling them this week.
[03:01:19.533 --> 03:01:20.694]  You mean the cats we arm?
[03:01:20.874 --> 03:01:21.315]  Train?
[03:01:21.435 --> 03:01:22.736]  Provide logistics to?
[03:01:22.876 --> 03:01:25.559]  Open the door wide open for them to come into our country?
[03:01:25.619 --> 03:01:26.440]  Come on, man.
[03:01:26.500 --> 03:01:27.902]  The audacity of this turd.
[03:01:29.223 --> 03:01:30.003]  All right, all right.
[03:01:30.043 --> 03:01:32.384]  Just cut to the chase and tell us your brilliant plan.
[03:01:32.484 --> 03:01:33.004]  Please!
[03:01:33.125 --> 03:01:33.785]  Please!
[03:01:33.805 --> 03:01:35.965]  I'm on the edge of my seat in anticipation.
[03:01:36.066 --> 03:01:41.928]  First, our military will continue to hunt down terrorist plotters in any country where it is necessary.
[03:01:42.108 --> 03:01:42.628]  Arm them.
[03:01:42.688 --> 03:01:43.148]  Bomb them.
[03:01:43.228 --> 03:01:43.648]  Fund them.
[03:01:43.848 --> 03:01:44.508]  Neutralize.
[03:01:44.608 --> 03:01:46.329]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, blah, blah, blah.
[03:01:46.389 --> 03:01:47.109]  Continue on.
[03:01:47.329 --> 03:01:54.672]  Second, we will continue to provide training and equipment to tens of thousands of Iraqi and Syrian forces fighting ISIL on the ground.
[03:01:54.892 --> 03:01:57.694]  You mean the cats that are cutting people's heads off and throwing them on the barbeque?
[03:01:57.714 --> 03:01:59.455]  You mean sending in soldiers' hearts?
[03:01:59.575 --> 03:02:00.296]  Kidnapping?
[03:02:00.476 --> 03:02:01.076]  Executing?
[03:02:01.156 --> 03:02:02.337]  Testing chemical weapons?
[03:02:02.437 --> 03:02:05.299]  Pot wall for raping non-Sunni and non-Muslim women?
[03:02:05.339 --> 03:02:08.542]  The ones that pledged allegiance to Al-Sayyad a couple years ago?
[03:02:08.682 --> 03:02:09.422]  Yeah, those cats.
[03:02:10.503 --> 03:02:14.386]  Third, we're working with friends and allies to stop ISIL's operations.
[03:02:14.866 --> 03:02:15.847]  To disrupt plots.
[03:02:16.247 --> 03:02:17.108]  Cut off their financing.
[03:02:17.308 --> 03:02:18.709]  Cut off their financing?
[03:02:18.809 --> 03:02:19.169]  What?
[03:02:19.289 --> 03:02:20.230]  You know how you do that?
[03:02:20.370 --> 03:02:22.431]  Stop giving them our money, you clown!
[03:02:24.113 --> 03:02:24.333]  Fourth,
[03:02:25.234 --> 03:02:36.559]  With American leadership, the international community has begun to establish a process and timeline to pursue ceasefires and a political resolution to the Syrian war.
[03:02:36.679 --> 03:02:41.482]  He means as soon as Assad steps down, which means there is no timeline!
[03:02:41.662 --> 03:02:43.703]  This is our strategy to destroy ISIL.
[03:02:43.923 --> 03:02:44.303]  What?
[03:02:44.423 --> 03:02:45.283]  Come on, man!
[03:02:45.384 --> 03:02:47.084]  That's your brilliant strategy?
[03:02:47.124 --> 03:02:47.725]  Get him, Bruce!
[03:02:50.066 --> 03:02:50.206]  Now,
[03:02:50.964 --> 03:02:51.104]  Oh, crap.
[03:02:51.124 --> 03:02:51.924]  Here it comes, people.
[03:02:51.944 --> 03:02:52.044]  Whoa.
[03:02:52.084 --> 03:02:52.665]  Let me get this straight.
[03:02:52.685 --> 03:02:55.686]  You mean that if you're on a no-fly list, a terrorist watch list... Watch being the key word here, people.
[03:02:55.866 --> 03:02:56.766]  No one's been watching?
[03:03:15.111 --> 03:03:18.438]  We also need to make it harder for people to buy powerful assault weapons.
[03:03:18.638 --> 03:03:20.762]  Perhaps they should ban pipe bombs also.
[03:03:23.810 --> 03:03:28.652]  Next, we should put in place stronger screening for those who come to America without a visa.
[03:03:28.972 --> 03:03:30.733]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[03:03:30.893 --> 03:03:36.275]  Isn't this the geezer that threatened to veto the refugee bill that would toughen the screening process last month?
[03:03:36.435 --> 03:03:37.135]  Yes, we can.
[03:03:37.175 --> 03:03:41.436]  These are the steps that we can take together to defeat the terrorist threat.
[03:03:41.476 --> 03:03:42.457]  Let me interpret.
[03:03:42.597 --> 03:03:42.837]  Sit.
[03:03:42.857 --> 03:03:43.597]  Roll over.
[03:03:43.717 --> 03:03:44.217]  Come here.
[03:03:44.337 --> 03:03:44.858]  Stay.
[03:03:44.998 --> 03:03:45.458]  Fetch.
[03:03:45.618 --> 03:03:46.058]  Attack.
[03:03:46.118 --> 03:03:46.498]  Heal.
[03:03:47.378 --> 03:03:48.639]  All at the same time.
[03:03:50.413 --> 03:03:51.993]  I can sum up your speech in one word.
[03:03:52.093 --> 03:03:52.613]  Double think.
[03:03:52.653 --> 03:03:54.234]  Because that's what he expects us to do.
[03:03:54.394 --> 03:03:55.254]  What is double think?
[03:03:55.354 --> 03:03:56.154]  I'm glad you asked.
[03:03:56.174 --> 03:04:00.295]  It's the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously.
[03:04:01.095 --> 03:04:02.335]  And... Accepting them both.
[03:04:02.455 --> 03:04:02.795]  Orwell, 1984.
[03:04:02.855 --> 03:04:04.716]  Just something to think about.
[03:04:04.836 --> 03:04:05.856]  I've changed the channel.
[03:04:06.436 --> 03:04:12.517]  And... I'm out.
[03:04:12.597 --> 03:04:14.177]  Really good job.
[03:04:14.857 --> 03:04:18.098]  Armed law-abiding citizens of the United States of America.
[03:04:20.319 --> 03:04:24.863]  Where the Bill of Rights protects our right to bear arms.
[03:04:25.344 --> 03:04:26.845]  And here are the bad guys.
[03:04:26.865 --> 03:04:32.150]  People who don't care about any laws or rights and are hell-bent on doing bad things.
[03:04:36.173 --> 03:04:37.635]  Here's a gun-free zone.
[03:04:38.395 --> 03:04:41.398]  Enforced by a sign.
[03:04:42.299 --> 03:04:44.561]  Here's us.
[03:04:45.456 --> 03:04:48.457]  Unarmed law-abiding citizens in the gun-free zone.
[03:04:49.577 --> 03:04:50.998]  And here are the bad guys.
[03:04:53.619 --> 03:04:56.500]  Here is us.
[03:04:59.240 --> 03:05:00.421]  Great job, Kenneth Webb.
[03:05:00.501 --> 03:05:01.221]  You are runner-up.
[03:05:01.281 --> 03:05:04.122]  You get the Hillary shirt for President and the Hillary pin.
[03:05:04.522 --> 03:05:06.843]  Anthony Gucciardi and Edward Grubb, straight ahead.
[03:05:06.863 --> 03:05:07.463]  Stay with us.
[03:05:10.176 --> 03:05:16.407]  I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
[03:05:17.623 --> 03:05:19.664]  The best-selling single of all time.
[03:05:19.964 --> 03:05:22.965]  In excess of a hundred million copies sold worldwide.
[03:05:23.465 --> 03:05:31.047]  But our college kids, raised in a narrative of white privilege and microaggression, think it's an offense to people of color.
[03:05:31.067 --> 03:05:32.608]  It's insulting to people of color.
[03:05:32.628 --> 03:05:36.909]  It perpetuates the idea that white is naturally good and that other colors are bad.
[03:05:37.329 --> 03:05:39.670]  And we feel that that's a microaggression.
[03:05:40.090 --> 03:05:41.470]  Here's a clue, boys and girls.
[03:05:42.170 --> 03:05:43.831]  It's about snow.
[03:05:45.730 --> 03:05:53.534]  The government educational establishment is destroying any connection to existing cultures so that they can create a new political culture.
[03:05:53.855 --> 03:05:57.757]  One of censorship and intolerance done in the name of tolerance.
[03:05:58.257 --> 03:05:58.898]  Fight back.
[03:05:59.438 --> 03:06:00.659]  Give the gift of knowledge.
[03:06:00.939 --> 03:06:04.641]  Send your friends to InfoWars, the cure for political correctness.
[03:06:05.202 --> 03:06:07.063]  And tell them Merry Christmas.
[03:06:09.215 --> 03:06:16.040]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[03:06:16.120 --> 03:06:18.822]  We've always offered five months free.
[03:06:19.002 --> 03:06:24.606]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[03:06:24.947 --> 03:06:28.049]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[03:06:28.349 --> 03:06:31.331]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[03:06:31.652 --> 03:06:33.013]  All of my documentary films,
[03:06:33.433 --> 03:06:40.357]  Scores of e-books and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:40.597 --> 03:06:44.440]  You don't just get six months free when you sign up from Christmas through New Year's.
[03:06:44.680 --> 03:06:51.364]  You also get to share that membership with up to 20 people simultaneously using your username.
[03:06:51.604 --> 03:06:59.028]  You can also sign up for a trial month and only pay $5.95 and then 20 of you and your friends and family can watch PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:59.169 --> 03:07:01.250]  Get 20 memberships at half price.
[03:07:01.430 --> 03:07:03.231]  Be the Paul Revere in your community.
[03:07:03.331 --> 03:07:06.885]  That's six months free when you sign up for a year at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:07:08.891 --> 03:07:12.093]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:07:12.413 --> 03:07:20.418]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:07:20.658 --> 03:07:25.682]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:07:26.082 --> 03:07:28.363]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[03:07:43.231 --> 03:07:47.192]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.

[03:08:23.988 --> 03:08:30.333]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting world-wide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:30.433 --> 03:08:36.517]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:36.657 --> 03:08:40.059]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi, your host, and I'm joined with Dr. Edward Group.
[03:08:40.079 --> 03:08:45.043]  We're going to get into a lot of news throughout this hour and also take your calls on health questions.
[03:08:45.063 --> 03:08:47.084]  I'm going to pose a question to you.
[03:08:47.104 --> 03:08:53.369]  You know, Time Magazine named Angela Merkel, Chancellor Angela Merkel, as Person of the Year.
[03:08:53.969 --> 03:08:59.391]  I'm going to question you on who you would name, and I'm going to tell you who I would name, and who Alex would name, and Dr. Group as well.
[03:08:59.732 --> 03:09:01.352]  But we're going to talk about a lot of stuff.
[03:09:01.832 --> 03:09:09.155]  And the good news is, there's actually no such thing, by the way, as internet censorship in China, according to China.
[03:09:10.096 --> 03:09:13.057]  China's top censor actually just released a statement.
[03:09:13.517 --> 03:09:19.580]  The senior Chinese official known as the gatekeeper of the country's internet has denied that the country censors online information.
[03:09:20.220 --> 03:09:25.908]  Lu Wei, Chief of State Internet Information Office, said China does not censor but manages internet content.
[03:09:26.589 --> 03:09:27.810]  So, I have good news for you.
[03:09:28.071 --> 03:09:33.939]  There's no such thing as internet censorship in the United States, either, or in the world, just anywhere, at all.
[03:09:34.439 --> 03:09:35.761]  It's only managed.
[03:09:36.562 --> 03:09:41.746]  So, when you go to post something online, it's blocked or it's taken down on YouTube or Facebook or whatever.
[03:09:42.046 --> 03:09:43.307]  That's actually not censorship.
[03:09:43.327 --> 03:09:43.867]  Good news guys.
[03:09:44.187 --> 03:09:46.129]  That's just managed content.
[03:09:46.409 --> 03:09:49.311]  The government manages it to keep you safe.
[03:09:49.851 --> 03:09:51.032]  So that's some uplifting news.
[03:09:51.372 --> 03:09:55.135]  But no, seriously, we're going to get into some other news about petition to ban Trump from the UK.
[03:09:55.175 --> 03:09:56.756]  Passes 250k signatures.
[03:09:57.116 --> 03:09:59.178]  Could he be actually banned in the United Kingdom?
[03:09:59.778 --> 03:10:01.420]  I wonder if that would still hold if he's president.
[03:10:01.460 --> 03:10:02.061]  That would be interesting.
[03:10:02.522 --> 03:10:08.130]  Google says it has proved its controversial quantum computer really works and it could do math better than a conventional computer.
[03:10:08.670 --> 03:10:13.637]  Anonymous couple drops $500,000 into a Salvation Army kettle outside of a small restaurant.
[03:10:14.335 --> 03:10:21.639]  We're going to talk about how Putin, we spoke about this a little bit earlier, but we're going to expand on how he's going to become a non-GMO dominant exporter.
[03:10:22.219 --> 03:10:25.621]  And in Kazakhstan, the internet backdoors you.
[03:10:25.781 --> 03:10:30.183]  They want to install some type of a chip or software, I'll have to read into it.
[03:10:30.663 --> 03:10:30.923]  I don't know.
[03:10:49.480 --> 03:10:53.242]  Everything you are interested in, everything you like, everything you do.
[03:10:53.342 --> 03:10:55.003]  Just tracks you 100% completely.
[03:10:55.203 --> 03:10:56.444]  We also have some uplifting news.
[03:10:56.964 --> 03:11:08.691]  But Dr. Group is going to talk to us about some really, really important health information on detoxing, on avoiding the average of five pounds that we all gain during the holidays, right?
[03:11:09.271 --> 03:11:16.375]  And some of the reasons that we're secretly, unknowingly packing on the weight, feeling like crap over the holidays when we can actually do about it.
[03:11:16.875 --> 03:11:17.956]  So, tell us about that.
[03:11:18.416 --> 03:11:22.518]  You know, coming, knowing I was going to be on the show today, I was like, what can I do for people?
[03:11:22.538 --> 03:11:46.929]  The holidays are coming up, you know, sometimes I come on the show, we promote the products, which are great, but I really want to give back to everybody and just say, put together a lot of facts and put together some tips that everybody can learn about the holidays and what they can do to be healthy during the holidays, how they can replace some of the toxic foods with some natural foods, how they can reduce their stress levels over the holidays, because I know they're probably going to have
[03:11:48.188 --> 03:11:51.509]  Parents and, you know, mother-in-laws and everything coming in.
[03:11:51.589 --> 03:11:59.152]  So it's not only having a non-toxic holiday season, but it's also, you know, how do you deal with all this stuff that's going on?
[03:11:59.712 --> 03:12:03.434]  And so I put together some things that I'd like to share with everybody.
[03:12:03.474 --> 03:12:09.496]  A few years ago, Consumer Reports did a survey on what Americans dread the most about the holidays.
[03:12:10.736 --> 03:12:12.357]  They dread the most going in debt.
[03:12:13.686 --> 03:12:16.287]  Dealing with crowds and gaining weight.
[03:12:16.867 --> 03:12:25.050]  And according to the National Cancer of Health Statistics, over 30% of American adults are overweight and another 30% are obese.
[03:12:25.550 --> 03:12:29.772]  So in other words, they dread the very thing they are just as much as going into debt.
[03:12:29.812 --> 03:12:30.852]  That's pretty hardcore.
[03:12:31.232 --> 03:12:33.753]  Gaining five pounds is just as bad as going into debt.
[03:12:34.233 --> 03:12:34.453]  Right.
[03:12:34.473 --> 03:12:44.162]  The New England Journal of Medicine says the average person gains at least one pound each year between Thanksgiving and New Year's and usually up to five pounds.
[03:12:44.182 --> 03:12:49.767]  I know everybody's interested in not being able to gain that weight.
[03:12:50.568 --> 03:13:00.437]  And when you look at the Thanksgiving, the Christmas holidays, really it starts around Halloween when you get all the candy and you start slowing down because wintertime starts coming in.
[03:13:00.757 --> 03:13:01.637]  And it's fun, though, too.
[03:13:01.677 --> 03:13:06.058]  Like, I definitely don't think what we're saying is, oh, you can't enjoy yourself, you can't have these things.
[03:13:06.198 --> 03:13:24.342]  Instead, it's just these little secret kind of attacks, these incognito health threats that we don't realize that are in all this stuff that we can easily get rid of, and you can still enjoy yourself, still have fun, which I'm all about, you know, enjoying yourself in the holidays, but not destroying your body, not gaining five to ten pounds and saying, oh, God, why did I do that?
[03:13:24.622 --> 03:13:25.602]  It's not actually that hard.
[03:13:25.762 --> 03:13:31.707]  Yeah, because come January, when you have your New Year's resolution, you'd be like, wow, I actually lost two pounds over the holidays?
[03:13:31.807 --> 03:13:32.048]  Right.
[03:13:32.688 --> 03:13:39.414]  So what I looked at was, you know, what are the most common toxic substances that people are going to be exposed to over the holidays?
[03:13:39.955 --> 03:13:51.745]  Number one is beverages, and that's going to be your coffee mixes, your eggnog, your different alcoholic drinks, different types of cocktails, soda.
[03:13:52.924 --> 03:13:53.965]  Eggnog, for example.
[03:13:54.006 --> 03:13:56.329]  Now, personally, I don't drink eggnog.
[03:13:56.729 --> 03:13:57.770]  I used to as a kid.
[03:13:57.830 --> 03:13:58.351]  I liked it.
[03:13:58.451 --> 03:14:02.156]  And sometimes I'll buy, like, the coconut eggnog for the kids or whatever.
[03:14:02.196 --> 03:14:09.145]  But I was amazed to find out that traditional eggnog is basically cream, sugar, white sugar, and eggs.
[03:14:10.086 --> 03:14:19.694]  And one 16 ounce serving of eggnog contains 500 to 800 calories and 40 grams of fat.
[03:14:20.134 --> 03:14:21.355]  One 16 ounce serving.
[03:14:21.756 --> 03:14:28.261]  That's without any alcohol added and that's the equivalent of you eating four glazed donuts.
[03:14:28.801 --> 03:14:34.928]  And I don't know about you guys, but I picture everyone drinking about five of those 16-ounce glasses of eggnog.
[03:14:34.948 --> 03:14:36.109]  Everyone just chugs it all day.
[03:14:36.149 --> 03:14:37.010]  With brandy in it.
[03:14:37.030 --> 03:14:42.275]  Wake up in the morning, let's have some eggnog, you know, and put a little brandy in there and just drink it throughout the day.
[03:14:42.315 --> 03:14:42.996]  It's pretty much it.
[03:14:43.036 --> 03:14:50.403]  The football games are coming on, the food's starting to come out, you're starting to get your eggnog, you're adding the brandy in there.
[03:14:50.423 --> 03:14:51.464]  Yeah, it's pretty bad.
[03:14:52.185 --> 03:15:07.474]  I'll tell you a natural replacement for eggnog is if you go to your natural or organic food store and you can get, it's still high in sugar but it's still going to be better for you, coconut eggnog, almond milk eggnog, they make it in like a chocolate mint and they make it in
[03:15:08.234 --> 03:15:23.525]  And different flavors, or better than that, just don't even drink the eggnog and just utilize water, which is another thing that people get dehydrated over the holiday season with all the alcohol and all these sugary drinks that dehydrate you.
[03:15:23.545 --> 03:15:31.470]  So one of my recommendations, too, over the holidays, just make a conscious effort to try to drink more water.
[03:15:31.530 --> 03:15:34.492]  You know, just get one of the glass
[03:15:35.478 --> 03:15:40.080]  Water containers and fill it up and just tell yourself you're going to drink two or three of those a day.
[03:15:41.501 --> 03:15:46.364]  The next thing I have on the list is the sugary drinks and sugar in general.
[03:15:47.885 --> 03:15:57.710]  For example, a 16 ounce peppermint white chocolate mocha from Starbucks contains syrups, whipped cream and chocolate that adds up to 500 calories and 76 grams of sugar.
[03:16:00.111 --> 03:16:15.685]  If you just get rid of the drinks that you're having on a daily basis and replace it with water or just something that's not complete junk, you'll realize that is about, I'd say, 70% of people don't realize all of the toxic matter they're taking in and the extra calories and they're getting fat is because of the drinks.
[03:16:15.905 --> 03:16:34.238]  Yeah, because I was looking at all these things and I was just amazed because I know, I mean, I have family members and I have people in my office, unfortunately, that, you know, really get into the Christmas spirit and they, you know, they're coming in with their venti mocha, peppermint mocha lattes and stuff, which have more calories than a cheeseburger.
[03:16:34.938 --> 03:16:35.438]  Believe it or not.
[03:16:35.458 --> 03:16:39.120]  There's just mega doses of sugar and milk and, you know, there's sweeteners and stuff.
[03:16:39.620 --> 03:16:46.064]  If you get one of those vanilla mocha frappuccinos or whatever it is, it's oftentimes like 2,000 calories.
[03:16:46.084 --> 03:16:50.506]  It's like sitting down eating an entire entree at a restaurant and people just drink it all day.
[03:16:50.526 --> 03:16:52.647]  Because you don't see the label, you don't actually care.
[03:16:52.667 --> 03:16:54.728]  And, you know, I want you to keep going.
[03:16:55.069 --> 03:16:56.329]  It also reminds me of this, though.
[03:16:56.369 --> 03:17:01.312]  Putin wants Russia to become the world's biggest exporter of non-GMO food, but that's not even the most important part.
[03:17:01.812 --> 03:17:12.779]  What most people that are covering this haven't realized is, perhaps the biggest part, is Putin says in this statement, the same one, that the Western food supply is basically crap.
[03:17:13.159 --> 03:17:27.808]  He says, we are not only able to feed ourselves, taking into account our lands, water, resources, Russia is able to become the largest world supplier of healthy, ecologically clean, and high quality food, this is the important part, which the Western producers have long lost.
[03:17:28.348 --> 03:17:32.352]  Especially given the fact that demand for such products in the world market is steadily growing.
[03:17:32.392 --> 03:17:41.321]  So he says, they have clean food, they have ecologically clean food, they have real organic food and high quality food, which the Western producers have long lost.
[03:17:41.902 --> 03:17:49.830]  So isn't it interesting that a world leader, Putin, who many would say should really be Time Magazine Man of the Year in some ways because of
[03:17:50.310 --> 03:17:59.053]  Many different fronts, because of his massive publicity and he's kind of outshined Obama in many ways, is saying that the Western food supply is essentially dead.
[03:17:59.493 --> 03:18:04.195]  Dead of, devoid of any high-quality, ecologically clean and healthy food.
[03:18:04.695 --> 03:18:06.376]  Devoid of any good organic food.
[03:18:06.936 --> 03:18:13.439]  And he says that Russia is going to step up and become the number one exporter of non-GMO organic food.
[03:18:13.479 --> 03:18:14.919]  This is from RT, Russia Today.
[03:18:15.479 --> 03:18:16.860]  That is his pivotal
[03:18:17.773 --> 03:18:18.454]  I don't know.
[03:18:41.112 --> 03:18:44.015]  Is that not the final testament of everything we're saying is true?
[03:18:44.295 --> 03:18:48.879]  All those so-called people saying, oh well, it's actually fine, the research has been clear, everything is fine.
[03:18:48.919 --> 03:18:54.583]  I mean, come on, a foreign leader has to come in and retake our food supply for us?
[03:18:55.184 --> 03:18:55.824]  Has it really gotten that bad?
[03:18:55.845 --> 03:19:04.852]  Well, maybe people will wake up and listen, you know a bunch of people are sweating bullets right now throughout Monsanto and throughout our government and throughout the USDA and the FDA.
[03:19:06.437 --> 03:19:08.938]  Listen, uh, we should have done that a long time ago.
[03:19:09.038 --> 03:19:12.619]  We should have never allowed all these chemicals in genetically modified foods.
[03:19:12.799 --> 03:19:15.219]  I mean, it's great that one country's stepping up.
[03:19:15.279 --> 03:19:20.961]  It's great that most of the other countries around the world... But it's horrible that Russia has to come in and tell us that our food supply is dead.
[03:19:21.001 --> 03:19:21.621]  We should know that.
[03:19:21.661 --> 03:19:22.581]  We should be taking steps.
[03:19:22.881 --> 03:19:24.362]  But it just shows the...
[03:19:25.382 --> 03:19:34.485]  Dead, just not even incompetency, but the unwillingness to act on the US politician side as the corporations just loot and pillage everything.
[03:19:34.505 --> 03:19:37.726]  I mean, everything you're reading on there is not because people are stupid.
[03:19:37.786 --> 03:19:39.847]  How dare you not know that you're getting that in your eggnog?
[03:19:39.867 --> 03:19:40.967]  You know, we don't know these things.
[03:19:40.987 --> 03:19:44.208]  A lot of us just go out and they have fun and they order whatever's on the menu.
[03:19:44.448 --> 03:19:46.531]  They're not always requesting the exact calorie counts.
[03:19:46.611 --> 03:19:50.716]  It's these corporations that are pushing it on us, making it sound healthy and destroying our health.
[03:19:50.996 --> 03:19:59.086]  We're going to talk about how we can avoid the rest of these holiday traps, some more news about whether or not Trump is going to be banned from the UK, and much more.
[03:19:59.106 --> 03:19:59.726]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:59.747 --> 03:20:00.688]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:09.946 --> 03:20:20.556]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:20:20.856 --> 03:20:24.780]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[03:20:25.040 --> 03:20:26.842]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:20:27.182 --> 03:20:32.647]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:20:32.807 --> 03:20:42.591]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:20:42.831 --> 03:20:49.094]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:20:49.334 --> 03:20:52.636]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for a diabetic.
[03:20:52.656 --> 03:20:54.497]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[03:20:54.737 --> 03:20:57.838]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:20:58.118 --> 03:21:02.141]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.tv, we have never offered 6 months free at Christmas.

[03:24:21.758 --> 03:24:22.819]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:22.879 --> 03:24:23.819]  This is the fourth hour.
[03:24:23.839 --> 03:24:24.919]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:24:25.359 --> 03:24:27.440]  We're going to take some of your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[03:24:27.460 --> 03:24:27.540]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:24:27.560 --> 03:24:31.262]  And I want to get your health questions for Dr. Group, but I want everyone that calls to also answer me this.
[03:24:31.302 --> 03:24:35.883]  Today, Time Magazine named German Chancellor Angela Merkel the Person of the Year.
[03:24:47.472 --> 03:24:53.435]  Now, to give you a little bit of a timeline, I printed out the previous year's chosen people.
[03:24:54.656 --> 03:25:04.220]  2014 were the Ebola fighters, the medical professionals who battled the disease in Africa and elsewhere, for quote, tireless acts of courage and mercy for buying the world time to boost its defenses.
[03:25:04.240 --> 03:25:05.501]  2013 was Pope Francis.
[03:25:07.662 --> 03:25:19.694]  For the first non-European pope in 1,200 years, poised to transform a place that measures change by the century, 2012 was President Obama, and 2011 was the protesters' era of spring, and 2010 was Mark Zuckerberg.
[03:25:25.441 --> 03:25:27.262]  And again, this year is Angela Merkel.
[03:25:27.582 --> 03:25:32.946]  I want to hear your take on who you would choose, if you had the ability, as the person of the year.
[03:25:32.966 --> 03:25:40.330]  I also want your health questions for Dr. Group, and then I'll tell you who I would choose, who Alex would choose, and Dr. Group can tell you who he would choose as well.
[03:25:40.950 --> 03:25:44.272]  Before we get into more with Dr. Group, I also want to talk about this story.
[03:25:44.813 --> 03:25:48.215]  Petition to ban Trump from UK passes 250,000 signatures and could be debated in Parliament.
[03:25:52.452 --> 03:25:53.513]  This is from CNN.
[03:25:53.873 --> 03:26:04.420]  A petition calling for Donald Trump to be banned from entering the UK has attracted more than a quarter of a million signatures, more than enough for a committee to consider sending the motion for parliamentary debate.
[03:26:04.961 --> 03:26:20.792]  The petition to block the front-running Republican presidential candidate from entering the country was created on the British government's official petitions website in response to Trump's call Monday to ban Muslims from entering the country without, until Obama did something about it.
[03:26:21.630 --> 03:26:23.650]  Of course, it was misquoted over and over again in the media.
[03:26:24.351 --> 03:26:44.635]  Now, if this is anything like the whitehouse.gov petitions, where if you get like 150,000 or whatever it is, they have to review it, it's pretty much a joke, in that we've actually, I've done some, I know Alex had a number of successful petitions that hit the limit, like ban Piers Morgan or whatever it was, but they usually just respond with, oh, we looked at it, nothing's gonna happen.
[03:26:44.675 --> 03:26:49.516]  So we'll see what happens with this, but could you imagine if they actually banned Donald Trump from the UK?
[03:26:50.276 --> 03:26:55.620]  And then can you imagine if he actually became president and he was still banned from the UK?
[03:26:55.960 --> 03:27:06.748]  So as the calls come in, I want to have Dr. Group just go through a few more ways that you can really avoid the weight gain, the toxic intake during the holidays and just whenever really in your life.
[03:27:06.828 --> 03:27:08.570]  Some of the most important secrets.
[03:27:08.590 --> 03:27:16.396]  Then we're going to go to your calls and cover some more news, some uplifting news, some quantum mechanic news on Google's new supercomputer that can do math.
[03:27:17.016 --> 03:27:18.497]  It's a lot of interesting stuff.
[03:27:18.577 --> 03:27:19.017]  But Dr. Group?
[03:27:20.185 --> 03:27:28.454]  Well, I'm looking forward to taking some calls, but another thing that came up that I wanted to let people know about is alcohol consumption over the holidays.
[03:27:28.934 --> 03:27:33.479]  If you are going to be consuming, most people consume two to three times the amount of alcohol.
[03:27:33.920 --> 03:27:39.205]  There's a lot of hangovers during the holidays and a lot of people reach for the Tylenol, the acetaminophen.
[03:27:40.399 --> 03:27:43.561]  It's been shown that that can cause permanent liver damage.
[03:27:43.641 --> 03:27:49.264]  So I just wanted everybody to be aware that, first of all, they should reduce their alcohol content.
[03:27:49.924 --> 03:27:52.145]  If they can't do that, they should drink more water.
[03:27:52.185 --> 03:27:59.089]  But if you do have headaches, be very careful taking acetaminophen with alcohol.
[03:27:59.209 --> 03:28:01.490]  I gotta tell you, acetaminophen is bad.
[03:28:02.811 --> 03:28:03.091]  It is bad.
[03:28:03.111 --> 03:28:04.892]  Children die from that.
[03:28:05.152 --> 03:28:06.033]  They die from it.
[03:28:06.133 --> 03:28:06.933]  The liver failure.
[03:28:06.973 --> 03:28:08.234]  The liver goes into failure.
[03:28:08.434 --> 03:28:15.999]  So for the record, and I'm not making any claims against certain brands, but the brands that have acetaminophen, oftentimes, even in small doses, there's been deaths.
[03:28:16.599 --> 03:28:23.423]  Acetaminophen is extremely hepatoxic, toxic to the liver, and then what people don't realize is they're drinking, and I've seen people do this.
[03:28:23.443 --> 03:28:24.644]  I had to stop them from doing it.
[03:28:24.964 --> 03:28:31.528]  They'll be out drinking the night before, and they'll say, oh, well, I'll just pop this, you know, pill, a brand name pill, with acetaminophen in it.
[03:28:32.088 --> 03:28:32.749]  And I'll be fine.
[03:28:32.789 --> 03:28:33.229]  No, no, no.
[03:28:33.309 --> 03:28:36.533]  If you are taking it with alcohol, you're damaging your liver.
[03:28:36.553 --> 03:28:40.237]  And then if you wake up and you're still drunk or you have a hangover or whatever, you're damaging it still.
[03:28:40.517 --> 03:28:41.699]  It cannot be taken with alcohol at all.
[03:28:41.719 --> 03:28:42.940]  So many people actually die from that.
[03:28:43.721 --> 03:28:44.402]  Here's the thing.
[03:28:44.962 --> 03:28:52.570]  If you don't change your diet at all, and you continue doing every single thing you normally do during the holiday season,
[03:28:53.396 --> 03:28:58.282]  Then at least take some X2 iodine, which is going to help you detoxify.
[03:28:58.443 --> 03:29:01.827]  Take some Deep Cleanse, take some Oxy Powder, and just supplement.
[03:29:01.867 --> 03:29:10.959]  I mean, right there alone, you're going to be taking care of the majority of the problems and drinking more water and reducing your stress levels over the holidays.
[03:29:12.190 --> 03:29:16.615]  That's many, many solutions that people can put into place.
[03:29:16.875 --> 03:29:24.244]  And the other great solution is just eat organic food and don't buy all the boxed and canned ingredients for Christmas.
[03:29:26.434 --> 03:29:27.555]  Stuffing, for example.
[03:29:28.035 --> 03:29:31.757]  I mean, if you read the ingredients on a stuffing box from the store, it's this long.
[03:29:32.217 --> 03:29:34.238]  The gravies all contain MSG.
[03:29:34.478 --> 03:29:37.819]  All the powdered gravies that you mix have MSG in them.
[03:29:38.420 --> 03:29:45.763]  Just go back to the old school way of doing things and eat healthy and cook your own Christmas dinner with organic ingredients.
[03:29:46.003 --> 03:29:46.703]  And it's cheaper, too.
[03:29:46.723 --> 03:29:48.364]  People always say, well, I can't afford organic.
[03:29:48.424 --> 03:29:50.485]  Well, if you buy the actual raw materials, it's much easier.
[03:29:50.725 --> 03:29:52.386]  We'll be back with your calls and more news.
[03:29:52.406 --> 03:29:53.366]  It's the Alex Jones Show.

[03:33:40.736 --> 03:33:42.837]  I'm not sure how far Alex is going to extend it.
[03:33:42.957 --> 03:33:44.679]  It was actually turned off for a while.
[03:33:44.699 --> 03:33:58.129]  We've also got the Essentials Pack, which includes X2, Super Male Vitality, or Super Female Vitality, and Silver Bullet, the three essential InfoWars Life products that are a great gift, or if you're just getting into it, or if you want to stock up.

[03:35:15.854 --> 03:35:25.323]  Hey guys, I was just calling in because I had heard earlier Alex talking a lot about what's going on with the politics, but now you guys are talking about the holidays.
[03:35:25.764 --> 03:35:37.195]  You're talking about the stresses and the food and the sugar and everything that people eat in the holidays, but this point ties in with that, and it ties in with the fact that people have an electrical, bioelectrical
[03:35:37.695 --> 03:35:38.316]  Thank you.
[03:35:53.963 --> 03:35:54.424]  I think so.
[03:36:08.658 --> 03:36:14.141]  You realize how much you become codependent in relationships and other things.
[03:36:14.181 --> 03:36:28.330]  So, I bring this point out to say that until we as a people, as a society, can grab a hold of our emotions, understand who we are as sexual beings, and also as emotional beings, and spiritual beings, we'll continue the same patterns.
[03:36:28.390 --> 03:36:32.112]  It doesn't matter if you alarm someone to the dangers of
[03:36:32.632 --> 03:36:35.895]  Yeah, David, that was beautifully said, and I would agree with a lot of that.
[03:36:35.915 --> 03:36:40.358]  In fact, I agree with all of it, except for the part that you can't warn people and you can't wake them up.
[03:36:40.418 --> 03:36:45.963]  Because I'm here to tell you that you really can, and there is obviously a really, really deep core
[03:37:00.194 --> 03:37:00.534]  Thank you.
[03:37:18.192 --> 03:37:20.113]  I call it feeding your brain cheese whiz.
[03:37:20.533 --> 03:37:20.653]  Right?
[03:37:20.673 --> 03:37:22.334]  You wouldn't eat cheese whiz every day.
[03:37:22.634 --> 03:37:26.836]  So why do we treat our content consumption so much differently than our food consumption?
[03:37:26.856 --> 03:37:37.322]  I wouldn't sit here and eat Lay's potato chips or whatever type of potato chips, Doritos, whatever, for every day for 12 hours, just like I wouldn't watch the mainstream media or American Idol every single day for 12 hours.
[03:37:37.502 --> 03:37:38.302]  I wouldn't personally.
[03:37:38.542 --> 03:37:39.323]  But some people do.
[03:37:39.643 --> 03:37:43.605]  And when they have that content stream coming in their brain, feeding their brain junk,
[03:37:44.145 --> 03:37:54.167]  The cheese whiz of content, they get into a poor state, they hear only about the terrorism and the fights, and Obama coming on television saying, ISIS is going to get you if you don't turn in your guns.
[03:37:54.647 --> 03:38:12.310]  We fight back with the counter-information, and I try to get a positive, solution-based thing, and Alex does too, constantly, all the time, and fighting back against all of that, and it can get tiresome, it can feel like a lot, it can make you want to give up sometimes, but the truth is you have to keep going on, and that's what you're saying, and I agree with you.
[03:38:12.890 --> 03:38:13.090]  Right?
[03:38:13.470 --> 03:38:17.413]  But I also say, give people some more chance than that, right?
[03:38:17.493 --> 03:38:24.397]  Because we're waking them up about this, they might learn about the fluoride, they might learn about any of this stuff, and then say, wow, I really want to learn more and make a change.
[03:38:24.437 --> 03:38:26.238]  And how many people have I seen that happen to?
[03:38:26.558 --> 03:38:28.259]  Including myself, right?
[03:38:28.279 --> 03:38:32.062]  Because I was never just magically awake, magically conscious, I knew all this stuff.
[03:38:32.882 --> 03:38:40.445]  It was, I know I was a standard quote-unquote normal person that would eat, drink my eggnog or whatever you want to call it, you know, without knowing what I was doing.
[03:38:40.865 --> 03:38:42.266]  So I believe in everyone.
[03:38:42.306 --> 03:38:49.669]  I believe in their ability to rise up 100%, but what you said was beautiful and I want to get Dr. Group's take on this, but I have one final question.
[03:38:49.729 --> 03:38:52.030]  Who is your Time Person of the Year, if you could choose one?
[03:38:54.110 --> 03:38:54.370]  David.
[03:38:56.224 --> 03:38:56.604]  I think so.
[03:39:11.657 --> 03:39:16.478]  And with Trump, I have fears of greater military expansion and Putin the same thing.
[03:39:16.758 --> 03:39:19.159]  But at least they understand that... Well, David, thank you.
[03:39:19.199 --> 03:39:19.879]  Right on, right on.
[03:39:20.059 --> 03:39:27.601]  And I apologize for cutting you off, but the music of the children in the back was, it was very beautiful, but I'm not, you know, some listeners might not enjoy it as much.
[03:39:27.682 --> 03:39:29.202]  But Dr. Group, tell me your take on that.
[03:39:29.282 --> 03:39:30.942]  And by the way, those are two great choices.
[03:39:31.002 --> 03:39:33.043]  I mean, I mean, you just have to look at it.
[03:39:33.103 --> 03:39:37.728]  No, I mean, I know David knows what he's talking about and that is the main goal.
[03:39:37.808 --> 03:39:48.918]  I mean, the main goal is to change the world and help as many people as we can and bring back the consciousness and let people know who they are, really, inside.
[03:39:49.859 --> 03:39:58.487]  And I can tell you that by cleansing the body, looking at what causes fear, because again, it's all about what is the root cause of our problem here.
[03:39:59.087 --> 03:40:00.048]  What causes fear?
[03:40:00.088 --> 03:40:01.329]  What causes depression?
[03:40:01.389 --> 03:40:05.993]  What causes all these things that create the desire for addiction?
[03:40:06.454 --> 03:40:09.396]  Food is more addictive than drugs.
[03:40:09.456 --> 03:40:10.777]  People don't even realize that.
[03:40:10.958 --> 03:40:12.379]  Alcohol kills more people.
[03:40:12.439 --> 03:40:14.381]  Food kills more people than drugs do.
[03:40:15.894 --> 03:40:18.538]  Gluten and wheat contain opiates.
[03:40:18.978 --> 03:40:19.980]  They're addictive.
[03:40:20.000 --> 03:40:23.164]  That's why people get addicted to bread and addicted to foods.
[03:40:23.224 --> 03:40:25.087]  It makes you feel good.
[03:40:25.167 --> 03:40:26.849]  Sugar makes you feel good.
[03:40:29.741 --> 03:40:45.026]  So, but I can tell you after evaluating hundreds of thousands of people that have gone through cleansing that the positive thing, the positive outlook that people have, you changed your life when you were suffering with disease and you found natural medicine.
[03:40:45.526 --> 03:40:52.428]  I grew up on TV dinners and, you know, Coca-Cola and the worst food and diets that you could imagine.
[03:40:52.448 --> 03:40:54.409]  I had acne all over my face and
[03:40:55.793 --> 03:40:57.454]  I changed my life.
[03:40:57.574 --> 03:40:58.735]  You changed your life.
[03:40:58.875 --> 03:41:01.936]  People every single day are changing their life.
[03:41:02.096 --> 03:41:15.904]  Even if they're doing it one step at a time, if there's a massive staircase that goes all the way down to cancer and disease and goes all the way up to perfect health, you don't have to take and jump a hundred steps at a time.
[03:41:16.024 --> 03:41:17.945]  It's about a daily change.
[03:41:18.105 --> 03:41:19.766]  As a matter of fact, that's what I recommend.
[03:41:20.666 --> 03:41:24.269]  Next time you need to buy salt for your home, don't buy table salt.
[03:41:24.349 --> 03:41:25.930]  Buy Himalayan crystal salt.
[03:41:26.030 --> 03:41:29.453]  Next time you need to buy deodorant, don't buy aluminum-based deodorant.
[03:41:29.533 --> 03:41:30.894]  Buy natural deodorant.
[03:41:30.994 --> 03:41:31.295]  Yes.
[03:41:32.988 --> 03:41:34.770]  In most of the cases, it's not as good.
[03:41:34.810 --> 03:41:38.875]  You might have to apply it two times a day, but you're making baby steps.
[03:41:38.895 --> 03:41:43.900]  You're making changes, and you're educating yourself, and you're doing what your body wants you to do.
[03:41:44.381 --> 03:41:47.644]  And believe it or not, you will become more conscious that way.
[03:41:47.704 --> 03:41:52.610]  When you detoxify the body, look at what causes depression and addiction.
[03:41:52.750 --> 03:41:53.511]  Fluoride!
[03:41:54.844 --> 03:41:57.645]  Causes calcification of your pineal gland.
[03:41:58.126 --> 03:42:00.127]  It causes depressive-like symptoms.
[03:42:00.227 --> 03:42:02.348]  It causes non-aggressiveness.
[03:42:02.808 --> 03:42:15.875]  When you look at BPA, fluoride, mercury, cadmium, aluminum, lead, all the phthalates, the BPAs, all of these different types of chemicals, yes, they do affect your brain.
[03:42:16.135 --> 03:42:19.676]  They make you to the point where you are unhappy.
[03:42:19.716 --> 03:42:22.218]  And that's why the psychological industry
[03:42:23.018 --> 03:42:33.819]  It's so profitable and that's why the pharmaceutical companies are focusing the majority of their marketing dollars on anxiety, depression and stress and everything else because there's no...
[03:42:34.932 --> 03:42:38.573]  Clinical testing needed to prescribe these medications.
[03:42:38.693 --> 03:42:41.434]  Even though for years we've been telling you it's all in the gut.
[03:42:41.454 --> 03:42:43.174]  I mean, you've said it for 20 plus years.
[03:42:43.234 --> 03:42:48.435]  I'm just a little mimicker, really, but I'm reading the studies and I found out for myself independently and realized you're saying the same thing.
[03:42:48.956 --> 03:42:53.677]  But geez, the studies proving that mental illness starts in the gut.
[03:42:54.117 --> 03:43:01.779]  And a lot of people also say, well, I'll also prove that your real consciousness, your real intellectual expansion, whatever you want to call it, has a biological aspect.
[03:43:02.239 --> 03:43:11.748]  Because most people that feel anxiety and depression, they don't even realize that could be a biological factor as opposed to, you know, a physical health gut factor as opposed to a mental factor.
[03:43:12.128 --> 03:43:13.810]  And a lot of it is a gut imbalance.
[03:43:14.350 --> 03:43:17.993]  So it's like your body can either help you or can be an anchor pulling you down.
[03:43:18.374 --> 03:43:28.303]  And when people's bodies aren't in alignment, they're totally jacked up, and thanks to these corporations that don't care, by the way, the true culprits of all this, when they're totally just bloated and feeling like crap,
[03:43:28.803 --> 03:43:31.666]  How are they supposed to be sitting there having an intellectual revolution?
[03:43:32.066 --> 03:43:32.987]  It's just not going to happen.
[03:43:33.207 --> 03:43:35.609]  The gut is contaminated and destroyed.
[03:43:35.889 --> 03:43:37.090]  It's leading to mental illness.
[03:43:37.531 --> 03:43:38.992]  It's leading to memory loss.
[03:43:39.032 --> 03:43:40.413]  It's just all these horrible things.
[03:43:40.634 --> 03:43:42.115]  So overall, I 100% agree.
[03:43:42.135 --> 03:43:44.757]  It starts really with the body and cleansing, which is what we're all talking about.
[03:43:45.218 --> 03:43:46.219]  Let's go to Jim.
[03:43:46.239 --> 03:43:47.340]  He wants to talk about cleansing.
[03:43:47.380 --> 03:43:48.701]  Jim in Florida, what's on your mind?
[03:43:51.123 --> 03:43:53.465]  Hey Jim, can you hear us?
[03:43:53.485 --> 03:43:54.166]  Is your phone working?
[03:43:56.843 --> 03:43:57.903]  All right, Jim, thank you for your call.
[03:43:57.943 --> 03:44:00.665]  Unfortunately, your phone is not working right now.
[03:44:00.705 --> 03:44:04.066]  Let's talk to Stefan, I believe, in Washington.
[03:44:04.086 --> 03:44:07.447]  He wants to talk about bloating and feeling out of it and possibly cleansing as well.
[03:44:07.467 --> 03:44:08.067]  What's on your mind?
[03:44:09.268 --> 03:44:09.808]  Yeah, hi there.
[03:44:10.388 --> 03:44:17.611]  Yeah, so I'm normal weight everywhere except on my stomach, especially in the evening.
[03:44:17.651 --> 03:44:21.133]  I'm like a pregnant woman walking around.
[03:44:22.033 --> 03:44:24.014]  So what do you have?
[03:44:24.912 --> 03:44:27.012]  Well, do you consume alcohol?
[03:44:28.331 --> 03:44:28.531]  No.
[03:44:29.011 --> 03:44:34.674]  Okay, so if you don't drink, then normally if you have some bloating in the afternoon.
[03:44:34.734 --> 03:44:42.598]  For men, if you have that extra weight around your waist, most likely your liver is congested.
[03:44:42.798 --> 03:44:45.499]  There's a few different things, so we'll talk about each.
[03:44:45.960 --> 03:44:56.565]  Your liver is congested and you need to do a liver cleanse, maybe one, two, or three liver cleanses, because that means your liver is not processing and metabolizing the fats
[03:44:57.165 --> 03:44:57.846]  Effectively.
[03:44:57.866 --> 03:45:07.814]  And without getting into your whole dietary habits and everything else, iodine deficiency is another cause of weight gain around the waist in males.
[03:45:08.354 --> 03:45:12.217]  It could also be associated with a B12 deficiency, a vitamin D deficiency.
[03:45:13.258 --> 03:45:30.685]  But with continued cleansing, going back to what Anthony said, the gut, how important the gut is, it's amazing how many symptoms mysteriously disappear, not mysteriously, but because the body actually has the necessary tools to heal itself when you fix the gut.
[03:45:31.414 --> 03:45:33.174]  The gut is the biodome.
[03:45:33.215 --> 03:45:34.835]  It's like the soil of the earth.
[03:45:35.795 --> 03:45:40.597]  In soil, you have microorganisms, right, that cause the plant to grow and thrive.
[03:45:41.177 --> 03:45:43.317]  In the gut, you have microorganisms.
[03:45:43.357 --> 03:45:47.018]  A lot of them actually are soil-based microorganisms that live in your gut.
[03:45:47.778 --> 03:45:50.359]  What those organisms do, we call them probiotics.
[03:45:50.559 --> 03:45:53.100]  And prebiotics are what probiotics eat.
[03:45:53.120 --> 03:46:00.042]  And prebiotics are different types of foods and inulin and oligosaccharides that the probiotics feed on.
[03:46:00.982 --> 03:46:09.406]  When you have the proper balance of probiotics in your gut, that will reduce some of the gas, reduce some of the bloating.
[03:46:10.697 --> 03:46:15.578]  Believe it or not, your neurotransmitters are produced in your gut that keep you happy.
[03:46:15.598 --> 03:46:18.459]  It's serotonin, melatonin, things like that.
[03:46:18.579 --> 03:46:27.861]  So, the first step that I always take with anybody, regardless of what condition they're suffering from, is to clean and repair the gut.
[03:46:28.141 --> 03:46:33.742]  You know, clean it out really good with the oxy powder, use a good probiotic formula, repair all that.
[03:46:34.282 --> 03:46:36.763]  Of course, slowly change their diet at the same time, but
[03:46:37.703 --> 03:46:46.437]  Thyroid issues really can cause excessive weight gain in different areas of the body in men, usually around the waist.
[03:46:47.158 --> 03:46:52.546]  So I would definitely look at possibly supplementing with an iodine supplement such as X2.
[03:46:52.987 --> 03:46:54.609]  And of course none of this is medical advice.
[03:46:54.629 --> 03:46:55.050]  Yeah.
[03:46:55.110 --> 03:47:06.623]  I'll also say that you should be thankful you're getting these signs and symptoms because I used to have that a long time ago and then I started really feeling more depressed and feeling more anxiety and feeling like crap and the bloating wasn't there as much.
[03:47:06.683 --> 03:47:11.910]  This is the beginning in my view, again not medical advice, of something that you can start potentially fixing.
[03:47:12.290 --> 03:47:13.390]  Thank you so much for your call.
[03:47:13.830 --> 03:47:15.851]  We're going to go to Stephen in Florida.
[03:47:15.891 --> 03:47:18.691]  He wants to talk about digestion and he wants to talk about person of the year.
[03:47:18.911 --> 03:47:26.273]  And I want to add, finish up this call and get into who we choose as person of the year and talk about some of that as well.
[03:47:26.313 --> 03:47:28.353]  So Stephen, first of all, who is your person of the year?
[03:47:28.373 --> 03:47:31.594]  Yeah, good afternoon.
[03:47:31.714 --> 03:47:34.035]  Well, I've got an east versus west.
[03:47:34.115 --> 03:47:34.935]  I've really got two.
[03:47:36.508 --> 03:47:44.716]  If it was a matter of East, I would have to nominate Vladimir Putin, because this man, like Alex Jones says, has really taken the moral high ground.
[03:47:44.736 --> 03:47:45.477]  He's stepped up.
[03:47:45.897 --> 03:47:52.665]  He's sent multiple messages to the globalists that he's not going to let them run him with his attacks on ISIS.
[03:47:53.325 --> 03:47:57.870]  You know, what I consider not to be sword-rattling, he'll make good what he's saying with his threats.
[03:47:58.784 --> 03:48:10.508]  Rightly so, but also this latest news about what he said, sending a message to the, you know, the people with the biotech so-called industry like Monsanto about organics.
[03:48:10.608 --> 03:48:15.189]  This is a really bombshell information and I hope that he was able to do that.
[03:48:15.749 --> 03:48:23.672]  On the Western side, I would have to nominate Alex Jones because I think of anybody in America, he has really stepped up.
[03:48:24.252 --> 03:48:28.213]  I know he says he's not a hero, but he is a modern-day Paul Revere among
[03:48:28.723 --> 03:48:34.607]  The founding fathers of that ilk, that's who I would, that's the two that I would nominate equally.
[03:48:34.983 --> 03:48:36.624]  I think those are two great choices.
[03:48:37.365 --> 03:48:51.036]  And, you know, when you talk about Putin, he wants to become an exporter of non-GMO food, he talks about the Western food supply dying, he constantly just criticizes all the really, really good points that he brings up in the United States, obviously has some issues as well.
[03:48:51.576 --> 03:49:04.387]  You talk about Alex, he's in here every day, three hours on the radio show, and what you don't see is the five plus hours he works every single day off the air, and he's 100% dedicated, 100% real, and I totally stand behind that choice as well.
[03:49:04.907 --> 03:49:09.468]  So actually, if you want to ask a question on the digestive tract real quick, Stephen, go ahead and burst it out.
[03:49:09.488 --> 03:49:18.389]  Yeah, I've got a friend that had recently, she's been diagnosed with, I think it's celiac disease, and she had to go to the hospital after an attack in her bowel.
[03:49:18.429 --> 03:49:23.770]  She had seven feet of her intestines removed, lost a lot of weight, still recovering at home.
[03:49:23.830 --> 03:49:31.952]  But what I wanted to find out is this, with the cleansing systems that Dr. Group, that you've developed, like the oxy powder and the liver cleanse, etc.,
[03:49:33.092 --> 03:49:36.213]  Would you recommend those to someone like that?
[03:49:36.233 --> 03:49:39.834]  Because their doctors are having her on a special basically liquefied diet.
[03:49:40.214 --> 03:49:41.554]  She can't have anything solid.
[03:49:42.534 --> 03:49:47.056]  Do you think that would help her or be harmful to her and her situation?
[03:49:47.236 --> 03:49:50.196]  Let me also just jump in and say once again this is not medical advice.
[03:49:50.356 --> 03:49:51.977]  So we're not giving medical advice to your friend.
[03:49:52.017 --> 03:49:56.478]  She should obviously speak to a qualified health care professional that is able to see her and physically see her.
[03:49:56.518 --> 03:49:57.578]  I mean Dr. Group is just sitting here.
[03:49:57.998 --> 03:49:59.899]  Listen to a vague example of the story.
[03:50:00.399 --> 03:50:10.144]  You know, I can't stand the regulations because it's just, you know, you can't tell somebody something that you know works 100% of the time.
[03:50:10.184 --> 03:50:13.286]  So it's just crazy the regulations they're coming down with.
[03:50:13.326 --> 03:50:14.587]  And it's all done by design.
[03:50:14.607 --> 03:50:17.228]  They're really trying to push out the natural medicine.
[03:50:17.268 --> 03:50:19.069]  I mean, that's what we had 3,000 years ago, okay?
[03:50:21.110 --> 03:50:28.115]  And now they're just trying, you know, there's just attack after attack after attack on stuff that actually works and gets people better.
[03:50:28.715 --> 03:50:33.118]  So if I had celiac disease, this is what I would do.
[03:50:33.338 --> 03:50:35.039]  Number one is I would cleanse and, you know...
[03:50:38.399 --> 03:50:41.660]  I would cleanse with oxy powder and I would repair the probiotics in my gut.
[03:50:42.140 --> 03:50:47.782]  I would also take the X2 and you know you can feel free to contact my office as well.
[03:50:47.882 --> 03:50:56.465]  I do have a support program for celiac disease or repairing the gut or rebalancing the intestinal tract.
[03:50:56.805 --> 03:50:59.406]  The medical profession has three options drug cut or burn.
[03:50:59.426 --> 03:51:05.328]  I'm sorry to hear that they cut out the intestines because once again they're not working on fixing the root cause.
[03:51:05.348 --> 03:51:06.308]  We'll be right back with
[03:51:06.408 --> 03:51:09.089]  The next segment will reveal Alex's Time Person of the Year choice.
[03:51:09.709 --> 03:51:13.030]  We've had an amazing year here at Supernatural Silver.
[03:51:13.250 --> 03:51:22.633]  We've truly enjoyed the fantastic response from thousands of people as they've tried our extraordinary product, and we're thrilled at the life-changing results people have.

[03:54:21.604 --> 03:54:24.005]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:24.025 --> 03:54:26.706]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi, joined with Dr. Edward Group.
[03:54:27.386 --> 03:54:30.607]  And we're talking about who we would choose for Time Person of the Year.
[03:54:30.627 --> 03:54:34.288]  And I'm going to explain Alex's choice as well, and Dr. Group here is going to tell you.
[03:54:34.688 --> 03:54:41.311]  So Time Magazine, in case you didn't hear, today named German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the Person of the Year.
[03:54:41.411 --> 03:54:50.734]  Previous ones include the Ebola fighters, Pope Francis, President Obama, the protester for Arab Spring that lit himself on fire, and Mark Zuckerberg.
[03:54:51.274 --> 03:54:52.295]  Some interesting choices.
[03:54:52.355 --> 03:54:57.697]  Some I can understand, some are quite interesting, like Pope Francis and Mark Zuckerberg, and obviously Obama.
[03:54:58.498 --> 03:55:05.421]  But we took a number of calls, and some of the callers said they chose Putin, Trump, Alex, and I think that was it.
[03:55:05.841 --> 03:55:09.763]  Dr. Group, who is your choice for Time Person of the Year, if you could magically choose it?
[03:55:10.003 --> 03:55:20.669]  Well, first of all, I don't really agree that much with Time Person of the Year, but I would have to, since it's not technically a person of the year, I would have to give that award to all of the
[03:55:21.835 --> 03:55:33.946]  Individual activists that have posted information on YouTube, that have gone out to the March Against Monsanto, the rallies, all the people out there that are educating everybody else to...
[03:55:35.954 --> 03:55:38.716]  Against the tyranny that's out there today.
[03:55:38.736 --> 03:55:41.537]  I mean, it's stuff that we work for every single day.
[03:55:41.677 --> 03:55:46.140]  And it's, you know, somebody asked me, you know, why don't you get in politics and why don't you be a senator?
[03:55:46.160 --> 03:55:48.661]  And I said, do you know how change happens?
[03:55:48.681 --> 03:55:56.725]  Okay, we wouldn't have the non GMO verified seal if it wasn't for the public speaking out and us in the public refusing to buy things.
[03:55:57.265 --> 03:56:00.807]  It's the activism and it's the people that create more change.
[03:56:02.268 --> 03:56:28.841]  Organic foods, look at all the different changes, getting fluoride out of the water, all the activism there, all the education, all the videos that are going up everywhere, all the newsletters that are going out educating people, all the people that are dedicating their life every single day, working 8 hours, 12 hours a day to try to change the world, make the world a better place to be, cleaning up the air quality, cleaning up the water quality, educating people on how they can become healthy and change their lives.
[03:56:29.381 --> 03:56:30.681]  Grassroots efforts.
[03:56:30.761 --> 03:56:31.862]  That's how change happens.
[03:56:31.922 --> 03:56:33.262]  It's not going to change in government.
[03:56:33.582 --> 03:56:34.002]  That's right.
[03:56:34.062 --> 03:56:34.482]  That's right.
[03:56:34.882 --> 03:56:35.902]  That's an amazing choice.
[03:56:36.262 --> 03:56:43.024]  And so Alex's choice, we just briefly asked him the question before we walked in, so he could probably give a better explanation perhaps on the show.
[03:56:43.304 --> 03:56:44.364]  But he chose Donald Trump.
[03:56:44.424 --> 03:56:45.624]  And I totally get why.
[03:56:45.984 --> 03:56:51.146]  Not only is Trump standing against political correctness, but the mainstream media hates him.
[03:56:51.426 --> 03:56:58.107]  And he's standing up against them, really as a third party, against the GOP establishment, against all establishments.
[03:56:58.467 --> 03:57:04.613]  He is an anti-establishment, self-made man that can pretty much say whatever he stands for and not have to care.
[03:57:05.093 --> 03:57:08.917]  And that is really admirable in many ways, even if you don't agree with his politics.
[03:57:09.537 --> 03:57:13.261]  Imagine that, someone that can sit there and he tweets some hardcore stuff.
[03:57:13.641 --> 03:57:20.847]  You know, definitely calling people dummies is not along the line of the mainstream media establishment that locks everyone into this political correctness.
[03:57:21.508 --> 03:57:24.989]  For me, you know, I think that's a great choice, and I think yours is an amazing choice as well.
[03:57:25.489 --> 03:57:30.130]  I would have to say that Matt Drudge 100% deserves to be Time Person of the Year.
[03:57:31.851 --> 03:57:33.951]  If not this year, then, you know, next year.
[03:57:34.311 --> 03:57:36.752]  Because you think about it, all these people are doing amazing things.
[03:57:36.792 --> 03:57:42.514]  Yes, Trump, you know, does some pretty amazing things, standing up for the right ways, even if you don't believe in many of his politics.
[03:57:42.834 --> 03:57:43.954]  The activists, all this stuff.
[03:57:44.454 --> 03:57:45.755]  But where does it all go to?
[03:57:45.995 --> 03:57:47.796]  It goes to the bullhorn of reality.
[03:57:48.216 --> 03:57:49.156]  Where do you go for news?
[03:57:49.216 --> 03:57:52.798]  Where do you go to see what, you know, Trump said or what Putin did or wherever you go?
[03:57:53.098 --> 03:57:59.762]  You go to the Drudge Report every single day and you sit there and you let it refresh for eight hours while you're at the workplace or wherever you are.
[03:58:00.402 --> 03:58:01.963]  And it's kind of a behind-the-scenes thing.
[03:58:02.123 --> 03:58:02.923]  Behind-the-scenes thing, right?
[03:58:02.943 --> 03:58:04.804]  There's no photos of Matt Drudge, there's no videos.
[03:58:05.104 --> 03:58:06.204]  He's a behind-the-scenes guy.
[03:58:06.504 --> 03:58:10.105]  But he's giving it all to you and feeding it in a way that makes sense.
[03:58:10.686 --> 03:58:12.786]  And it's a succinct bullhorn of reality.
[03:58:12.826 --> 03:58:16.448]  So I would choose 100% Matt Drudge and I salute him for all he has done.
[03:58:16.868 --> 03:58:18.228]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:58:18.368 --> 03:58:20.889]  Alex will be back live from 11 to 2 tomorrow.
[03:58:20.909 --> 03:58:22.690]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi, Dr. Group.
[03:58:22.950 --> 03:58:24.010]  Thanks so much for joining us.
[03:58:24.590 --> 03:58:25.891]  And all have an amazing day.
[03:58:25.931 --> 03:58:26.711]  We'll see you again tomorrow.
