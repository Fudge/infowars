[00:00:06.141 --> 00:00:07.996]  What are you, a warrior or a cat?
[00:00:08.318 --> 00:00:09.003]  Look at that one!
[00:00:11.906 --> 00:00:20.833]  According to a national phone survey conducted by Rasmussen Reports, 39% of voting Americans believe we are losing the war on terror.
[00:00:21.214 --> 00:00:21.834]  Up from 33%.
[00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:24.396]  Confidence in the U.S.
[00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:36.146]  anti-terrorism efforts hit a high of 62% in February 2009, then steadily deteriorated until the killing of Osama Bin Laden in May 2011 when it rebounded into the 50s.
[00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:40.650]  But it had been trending steadily down for most of the past two years.
[00:00:41.328 --> 00:00:47.871]  See, even if you believe the government story, you have to see it as the most botched operation in history.
[00:00:47.891 --> 00:00:58.816]  So why in the world would you kill the mastermind who has all the secrets of terrorism, when he's unarmed, harmless, and surrounded?
[00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:05.559]  Number one, we're viewed as idiots and stupid, and Americans are not seen as very bright by our politicians.
[00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.895]  Secondly, basically the president was in very deep trouble, as you said.
[00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:13.999]  Economically, politically, he was on the bottom.
[00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:15.741]  He had the birther issue come out.
[00:01:16.202 --> 00:01:21.268]  He proved he said he was American, but now he had to prove that he was more than American.
[00:01:21.328 --> 00:01:22.970]  He was more American than American.
[00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:24.032]  He had to be aggressive.
[00:01:24.992 --> 00:01:37.419]  49% of voters now believe most Muslims worldwide view the United States as an enemy, up from 39% earlier this year, and tying the highest level last measured in August 2013.
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.141]  Over half, 52%, believe U.S.
[00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:46.784]  relations with the Islamic world are worse today than they were five years ago, up from 44% last August.
[00:01:49.099 --> 00:02:02.392]  And if you're a radical Islamicist from one of dozens of countries, you're allowed to go back and forth on planes to train at terror camps, have Facebook accounts showing you're gonna do it, you're allowed to come back and kill and shoot people.
[00:02:02.673 --> 00:02:04.975]  Common sense is rising in the polls as well.
[00:02:05.355 --> 00:02:09.760]  Americans now believe having a gun is the best way to protect against crime.
[00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:12.442]  63% to 30%.
[00:02:12.542 --> 00:02:25.872]  Pew Research Center found that while support for gun control once reached 66%, it has dropped to 46% while support for gun rights has jumped 52%, the highest ever in the past 25 years.
[00:02:28.642 --> 00:02:33.745]  Basically, we want to close the loophole for the gun shows here locally and nationally.
[00:02:35.367 --> 00:02:44.734]  We want to do something about the Second Amendment to help Congress know that, you know, the American people stand by them and their... I have to disagree with it 100%.
[00:02:44.774 --> 00:02:46.876]  The Second Amendment was put in there for a reason.
[00:02:47.156 --> 00:02:47.896]  Are you sure, sir?
[00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:50.078]  Yes, sirree, I'm absolutely sure.
[00:02:50.098 --> 00:02:52.980]  These guys... The right to bear... If you don't have... Just try it.
[00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:54.942]  I got my permit with me.
[00:02:55.662 --> 00:02:56.023]  I pack
[00:02:57.162 --> 00:03:00.164]  I have no way in hell I want anybody telling me I can't.
[00:03:00.364 --> 00:03:05.866]  The Washington Examiner says to say the shift in opinion is radical is not an understatement.
[00:03:06.127 --> 00:03:10.249]  It follows a short period where Americans were torn over gun ownership.
[00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:18.653]  We're hoping that with Obama in for a term where he doesn't have to face re-election, that it was going to be Katy Barr the door.
[00:03:18.673 --> 00:03:26.437]  And I think that explains why the media feeding frenzy following Newtown has far outlasted
[00:03:27.057 --> 00:03:27.918]  I'm good.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.480]  take the heat.
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.800]  I don't think so.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.781]  I think they're hurting themselves every day that they keep this debate going.
[00:03:44.061 --> 00:03:54.823]  The findings also track with support for the National Rifle Association, which had its second biggest national convention earlier this month, and whose membership has reached five million.
[00:03:55.444 --> 00:04:01.745]  When freedom shivers in the cold shadow of true peril, it's always the patriots
[00:04:03.103 --> 00:04:04.324]  Who first hear the call.
[00:04:04.864 --> 00:04:16.152]  When ordinary hands can possess such an extraordinary instrument, that symbolizes the full measure of human dignity and liberty.
[00:04:16.372 --> 00:04:23.957]  For everyone within the sound of my voice, to hear and to heed, and especially for you, Mr. Gore.
[00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:30.814]  From my cold dead hands!
[00:04:31.817 --> 00:04:33.320]  John Barron, InfoWars.com
[00:04:41.514 --> 00:04:45.899]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.481]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:04:48.782 --> 00:04:58.472]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
