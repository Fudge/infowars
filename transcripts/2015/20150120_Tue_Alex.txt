[00:00:05.185 --> 00:00:06.506]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.267]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.267 --> 00:00:10.028]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.028 --> 00:00:11.609]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:13.170]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.352]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.352 --> 00:00:26.137]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.137 --> 00:00:27.318]  I should have hyped this up.
[00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:31.040]  I mean, I really don't hype things like I should.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.501]  We have a one hour
[00:00:34.142 --> 00:00:44.785]  Debate with Bill Ayers, the former head of the Weathermen Underground, and Bill Clinton's mentor, joining us today in the second hour.
[00:00:44.785 --> 00:00:47.926]  So that should be extremely informative.
[00:00:47.926 --> 00:01:00.730]  I can't wait to ask him about how he's funded by big foundations and why the robber barons and ultra-rich continue historically over and over again to fund socialist and communist movements.
[00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.810]  That's coming up.
[00:01:03.234 --> 00:01:09.035]  Also, I'm working on getting Dr. Jerome Corsi on the transmission today.
[00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:14.436]  He's got a powerful article we have linked up at InfoWars.com from WorldNetDaily.com.
[00:01:14.436 --> 00:01:20.237]  Generals conclude Obama backed Al-Qaeda.
[00:01:20.237 --> 00:01:24.218]  That's right, and we're going to be going over this article.
[00:01:24.218 --> 00:01:30.239]  But more and more, the military and former brass are going public, including congressmen.
[00:01:31.263 --> 00:01:35.264]  are now speaking out about this information.
[00:01:35.264 --> 00:01:42.686]  Now, I know for our audience this is really old news, but it's not something the general public has consciously come to grips with.
[00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:46.788]  The military knows.
[00:01:46.788 --> 00:01:54.490]  And see, supporting the troops is not supporting lies and fraud or having the troops go battle for Al-Qaeda in Syria or Libya.
[00:01:56.957 --> 00:02:09.738]  Just like supporting our troops and not hating them, like a Michael Moore or a Bill Ayers, doesn't mean then you support a movie like American Sniper that is propaganda and is full of BS.
[00:02:11.578 --> 00:02:14.839]  It doesn't mean you just buy into stuff that's slickly packaged.
[00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:16.039]  By the way, I love Clint Eastwood.
[00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:17.720]  He's my favorite actor, probably.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.300]  People always ask me, who's your favorite actor?
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.021]  And I've really been thinking about it over the years.
[00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:23.741]  It's probably Clint Eastwood, the icon of icons.
[00:02:23.741 --> 00:02:28.323]  And I am physically sick at American Sniper.
[00:02:28.323 --> 00:02:34.264]  That we've now reviewed and we've got that review coming up in the next segment.
[00:02:34.264 --> 00:02:36.585]  Because it is a powerful film.
[00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:38.786]  It makes an individual look like a hero, a good guy.
[00:02:38.786 --> 00:02:39.626]  You want to believe in him.
[00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:46.292]  And so to attack the lie, you're attacking something that feels good on the surface.
[00:02:46.292 --> 00:02:50.095]  Because the guy Chris Kyle plays is a great guy.
[00:02:50.095 --> 00:02:56.420]  The truth of who Chris Kyle really is, isn't in this film.
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.982]  You know, they don't talk about him divorced from his wife.
[00:02:58.982 --> 00:03:02.605]  They don't talk about him setting up a company to get the money away from her.
[00:03:02.605 --> 00:03:05.207]  That's what came out in the court case.
[00:03:05.207 --> 00:03:09.671]  She goes on TV and cries about him and says this movie's so accurate, when that's not the truth.
[00:03:12.145 --> 00:03:19.249]  I mean, when Chris Kyle heard he had a huge bounty on his head, he famously said, my God, you know, my wife will try to cash in on that.
[00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:29.955]  So, you know, watching his wife go around, it's like Michael Hastings' wife, who worked in the National Security Council in the most classified areas.
[00:03:29.955 --> 00:03:33.177]  I mean, that's as high level as it gets in the shadow government.
[00:03:33.177 --> 00:03:34.978]  Definitely a spook.
[00:03:34.978 --> 00:03:37.419]  I talked to folks like Joe Biggs, who was at his funeral.
[00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:40.702]  And she was like, oh yeah, I think they killed him.
[00:03:40.702 --> 00:03:41.323]  Oh, it's terrible.
[00:03:41.323 --> 00:03:42.225]  Oh, it's horrible.
[00:03:42.225 --> 00:03:47.557]  Then she goes on CNN on Piers Morgan and cries and says the official story's true.
[00:03:48.831 --> 00:03:50.251]  It's bull, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:57.713]  They killed Private Lynch's crew when they started going public saying it was a fraud, so they could promote women in the military.
[00:03:57.713 --> 00:04:00.194]  They killed Pat Tillman when he wasn't going to play ball.
[00:04:00.194 --> 00:04:05.595]  And so of all the news we've got in front of us, I'm going to do a review of this from the nightly news last night.
[00:04:05.595 --> 00:04:11.096]  It's about nine minutes long, because it's not just about Chris Kyle or Clint Eastwood or American Sniper.
[00:04:12.188 --> 00:04:13.990]  It's about propaganda.
[00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.152]  It's about deciphering it and coming to grips with it.
[00:04:17.152 --> 00:04:27.501]  Because this is all war propaganda timed for new terror attacks to launch a war in the Middle East where they will attack a country or group that's against Al Qaeda.
[00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:30.684]  Just like Saudi Arabia is involved in 9-11, we attack Iraq, their archenemy.
[00:04:32.622 --> 00:04:36.624]  They're saying we should go into Syria so Al-Qaeda doesn't have a base when our own government put them in there.
[00:04:36.624 --> 00:04:42.886]  So understanding this can bring down the globalists and we're close because the military is going public more and more.
[00:04:42.886 --> 00:04:44.347]  They understand what's happening.
[00:04:44.347 --> 00:04:45.467]  Now we can educate the public.
[00:04:45.467 --> 00:04:46.708]  It's a big deal.
[00:04:46.708 --> 00:04:48.508]  We got Bill Airs coming up.
[00:04:48.508 --> 00:04:50.449]  We got some medical news coming up.
[00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:53.930]  We've got generals conclude Obama backed Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.451]  It's all coming up today and a lot more.
[00:04:56.451 --> 00:04:57.572]  You'll be wanting to stay with us.
[00:04:59.318 --> 00:05:03.919]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:10.361]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:19.684]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.

[00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:32.957]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:37.239]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:39.020]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.343]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:46.884]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[00:05:46.884 --> 00:05:48.025]  But for how long?
[00:05:48.025 --> 00:05:50.226]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:05:50.226 --> 00:05:54.668]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:54.668 --> 00:05:57.470]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:05:58.974 --> 00:06:01.595]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:01.595 --> 00:06:03.096]  Check it out today.
[00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:11.480]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none and that's what you'll find at Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:18.524]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[00:06:18.524 --> 00:06:19.245]  We're good to go.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.920]  We're good.
[00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:07.895]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[00:07:07.895 --> 00:07:17.860]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:24.870]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:31.280]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.944]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:07:34.224 --> 00:07:34.845]  We're good.
[00:08:16.653 --> 00:08:23.136]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:26.578]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.578 --> 00:08:33.962]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live, broadcasting worldwide, coming to you from the new InfoWars.com studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:08:33.962 --> 00:08:35.703]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:35.703 --> 00:08:43.027]  Again, it is the 20th day of January, 2015, on this Tuesday worldwide transmission.
[00:08:43.027 --> 00:08:45.348]  Bill Ayers, Bill Clinton's mentor, who he
[00:08:46.513 --> 00:08:57.960]  Of course, also as a mentor to Barack Obama, will be joining us coming up in the second hour today for a debate.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:07.226]  We were reached out to months ago by Bill Ayers' people saying that we hear Alex Jones doesn't like Bill Ayers.
[00:09:07.226 --> 00:09:12.009]  And so this is somebody that Barack Obama has even lived with.
[00:09:13.307 --> 00:09:17.691]  Hillary Clinton, of course, has praised Bill Ayers and sent him letters.
[00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:27.139]  We also know that Hillary Clinton's letters were published last year, dozens and dozens of them, that she had sent to Saul Alinsky.
[00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:28.901]  Rules for radicals.
[00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:32.664]  So I'm not going to do the standard conservative attack of Bill Ayers.
[00:09:32.664 --> 00:09:34.185]  I'm just going to talk to him about, hey,
[00:09:36.107 --> 00:09:40.589]  Big tax-free foundations fund you, Carnegie Ford endowment, correct?
[00:09:40.589 --> 00:09:46.432]  He'll probably say no, then we can go back and show where he's funded by them later.
[00:09:46.432 --> 00:09:48.653]  So that's really the whole point of this interview.
[00:09:48.653 --> 00:09:51.974]  And I'm putting my cards on the table in case they're listening and they want to check it out coming on.
[00:09:51.974 --> 00:09:59.258]  Because I'm going to ask him questions, I'm going to let him sit there like a commie and lie to people, and then I'm going to absolutely grill him.
[00:09:59.963 --> 00:10:01.764]  With the information.
[00:10:01.764 --> 00:10:03.245]  So that's what's coming up.
[00:10:03.245 --> 00:10:05.986]  And I'm sure he'll have his attacks as well.
[00:10:05.986 --> 00:10:17.091]  But we're going to be breaking down why are communists so connected to the ultra-rich, one-tenth of one percent throughout history, over and over and over again.
[00:10:17.091 --> 00:10:22.093]  How proud is he of his Lord and Savior, Barack Hussein Obama?
[00:10:22.093 --> 00:10:26.696]  I guess that's Jamie Foxx that called him the Lord and Savior.
[00:10:26.696 --> 00:10:28.977]  So that is all coming up
[00:10:29.597 --> 00:10:39.441]  Today, this story is one of our top stories, and we're going to be getting to it as well.
[00:10:39.441 --> 00:10:43.363]  Generals conclude Obama backed Al Qaeda.
[00:10:43.363 --> 00:10:49.825]  But first, I want to review American Sniper, Clint Eastwood's new film, because it's bigger than just a movie.
[00:10:49.825 --> 00:10:52.566]  It is the science of propaganda decoding it.
[00:10:52.566 --> 00:10:53.927]  You can understand the big picture.
[00:10:53.927 --> 00:10:56.168]  And here is my review from InfoWars Nightly News last night.
[00:11:01.758 --> 00:11:15.967]  And finally, tonight on InfoWars Nightly News, we're going to break down and analyze what is some of the most thought-provoking propaganda that we have ever seen in 20 years of operation.
[00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:30.697]  I'm talking, of course, about the blockbuster film that made over $105 million on its opening weekend, produced and directed by Hollywood icon of icons, legend Clint Eastwood.
[00:11:31.377 --> 00:11:41.106]  I've been a big fan of Clint Eastwood since I grew up watching Spaghetti Westerns with my folks, and I agree with many of the political views of Clint Eastwood.
[00:11:41.106 --> 00:11:58.261]  That said, the film is very upsetting when you know the admitted facts surrounding Chris Kyle, the American sniper's life, and the book that he wrote so it would be produced into a Hollywood film.
[00:11:59.605 --> 00:12:03.509]  Please keep an open mind here because I'm not attacking Chris Kyle.
[00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:05.711]  I'm not attacking Clint Eastwood.
[00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:16.702]  I'm attacking a known Pentagon system that creates fables, that creates stories, that creates legends to manipulate the public mind.
[00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:31.572]  Now, before I get into the film itself and my review and breakdown, it's important to note that in a few minutes we'll play a clip of where I actually had a discussion with Chris Kyle shortly before he was killed outside Dallas, Texas.
[00:12:31.572 --> 00:12:37.954]  So I've talked to Mr. Kyle on air, and I've also talked to some of his friends and family.
[00:12:37.954 --> 00:12:45.336]  But before I get into this current case, I want to look at some past cases where we've caught
[00:12:46.348 --> 00:12:50.389]  Corrupt elements inside the Pentagon engaging in serious deception.
[00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:54.250]  First, let's look at the case of Pat Tillman, who I see as a real hero.
[00:12:54.250 --> 00:13:01.571]  Gave up a lucrative contract to go join his brother fighting who he believed was involved in the September 11th attacks.
[00:13:01.571 --> 00:13:09.633]  He began to write home to family and friends saying, this whole war is a fraud and we're helping him grow the drugs and it's a scam.
[00:13:09.633 --> 00:13:11.013]  I'm going to come home and expose it.
[00:13:11.693 --> 00:13:19.636]  Well, they executed him, then claimed he was a hero who died charging a machine gun nest fighting Al-Qaeda.
[00:13:19.636 --> 00:13:27.940]  It later came out, because the Army coroner wouldn't lie, that he'd been killed by friendly fire in an apparent homicide.
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.281]  Now pay attention to this pattern.
[00:13:30.281 --> 00:13:34.723]  Pat Tillman was worth billions in Army and Pentagon recruiting money.
[00:13:35.694 --> 00:13:39.977]  They couldn't allow him to then turn against it, so he had to be taken out.
[00:13:39.977 --> 00:13:43.259]  Because this pattern repeats over and over again.
[00:13:43.259 --> 00:13:46.542]  Remember Private Jessica Lynch?
[00:13:46.542 --> 00:13:56.568]  It even came out that Jerry Bruckheimer, the Hollywood producer, was on sat phone directing how to save her at the hospital, which they knew the Iraqis had pulled out three days previous.
[00:13:57.429 --> 00:14:04.614]  They gave her credit for battling this column of Iraqis in her supply truck as the men cowered in fear.
[00:14:04.614 --> 00:14:07.757]  Well, the men began to speak out and say, we actually fought them.
[00:14:07.757 --> 00:14:09.298]  She hid in the back in fear.
[00:14:09.298 --> 00:14:12.800]  So not one, not two, not three, but four different members.
[00:14:13.766 --> 00:14:25.013]  who were actually in the firefight, all ended up dying, getting shot in the head, being found dead in their cars, being found in a puddle of water, because dead men tell no tales.
[00:14:25.013 --> 00:14:38.941]  Then, Private Lynch went public in a press conference and said, it's all a fraud, I was told a lie, to put out a book, to put out a movie, they already had Hollywood deals, to come out and show her as this hero, to recruit women in the military,
[00:14:39.841 --> 00:14:45.199]  And to sell the military on the idea of putting women in front line combat.
[00:14:46.559 --> 00:14:53.081]  All I know is, I don't believe that Jesse Ventura said, you deserve to lose a few.
[00:14:53.081 --> 00:14:59.382]  But as soon as he said the thing on O'Reilly and stuff about, yeah, he said, you deserve to die.
[00:14:59.382 --> 00:15:02.563]  You guys deserve to die when the family's right there.
[00:15:02.563 --> 00:15:04.743]  That is made up, period.
[00:15:04.743 --> 00:15:06.424]  I knew it was bull then.
[00:15:06.424 --> 00:15:10.025]  I feel the opinion that he said exactly what I thought he heard.
[00:15:10.025 --> 00:15:12.605]  And I feel horrible about it coming out the way it had.
[00:15:12.605 --> 00:15:15.346]  And I'm sorry I handled it the way I did on your show.
[00:15:15.966 --> 00:15:19.367]  I guess I should have just denied it and said I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:15:39.708 --> 00:15:51.394]  When the asset, when the front man's story is compromised, they kill members of the unit who aren't playing ball, or they kill the front person if they don't go along with it.
[00:15:51.394 --> 00:15:53.815]  Now we don't know what really happened with Chris Kyle.
[00:15:54.810 --> 00:16:12.650]  But even before he was dead, we had reporters on the ground in Boston, and we had the surveillance footage that showed men wearing the uniform of his security company, Kraft International, with the Punisher symbol, with the blood dripping, wearing their uniforms and having black backpacks.
[00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:16.134]  And we never said that they were involved in the bombing.
[00:16:17.395 --> 00:16:25.799]  We surmised that they were probably called in to run security because there may have been intel that there was going to be a terror attack.
[00:16:25.799 --> 00:16:29.040]  The media then spun that and claimed that we were saying they were terrorists.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:33.662]  So that let us know that we were on target, that they were putting this type of disinformation out.
[00:16:33.662 --> 00:16:41.386]  Then MSNBC came out claiming the Czarnev brothers bombed and that I had actually influenced them with no evidence.
[00:16:41.966 --> 00:16:50.814]  So you need to understand, anytime you get near Chris Kyle, or Kraft International, or anything they're involved in, there's massive controversy going on.
[00:16:50.814 --> 00:17:00.163]  And that's because we know Navy SEALs and private contractor groups made up of SEALs, like Blackwater and others, are used as intelligence group cutouts.
[00:17:00.723 --> 00:17:04.525]  And a lot of time are used for patsies or decoys.
[00:17:04.525 --> 00:17:06.486]  Ladies and gentlemen, I live this.
[00:17:06.486 --> 00:17:08.067]  I didn't just debate Chris Kyle.
[00:17:08.067 --> 00:17:09.787]  I'm not just friends with Jesse Ventura.
[00:17:09.787 --> 00:17:18.652]  I didn't just cover the Boston bombing with all reporters on ground and break the major stories of what appeared to be Kraft International on the ground and then they wouldn't deny it.
[00:17:19.512 --> 00:17:32.369]  I lived here in Austin and saw with my own eyes the city shut down for much of a day while Chris Kyle's body was brought in to be buried and as he was built up as the ultimate hero.
[00:17:32.369 --> 00:17:37.035]  This thing has all the signs of scripting from the start to the finish.
[00:17:37.936 --> 00:17:46.084]  And it needs to be investigated to really discover who Chris Kyle was and why he was actually killed.
[00:17:46.084 --> 00:17:48.046]  This thing stinks to high heaven.
[00:17:48.046 --> 00:17:51.089]  And then you go and sit in the theater and watch the movie.
[00:17:51.089 --> 00:18:00.459]  And he loves Muslims and he wants to help them and he wants to get Al-Qaeda people to come join him to fight the terrorists and he's such a sweet person that gets along great with his wife.
[00:18:01.601 --> 00:18:14.148]  When the court records show it's the opposite and they were divorced and he was setting up these companies to try to transfer his assets into them and none of it is true from our research as best we can tell.
[00:18:14.148 --> 00:18:16.229]  It's just not true.
[00:18:16.229 --> 00:18:19.111]  He didn't call up crying when he had to shoot people.
[00:18:19.111 --> 00:18:24.694]  He was quoted in the news, in radio interviews, in TV interviews saying that
[00:18:25.674 --> 00:18:32.896]  The enemy are despicable savages and that he only regrets he didn't kill Moore.
[00:18:32.896 --> 00:18:37.257]  He made those statements in his best-selling book, American Sniper.
[00:18:37.257 --> 00:18:42.999]  Now look, I'm not criticizing him like Michael Moore is, saying that any sniper is a coward.
[00:18:44.184 --> 00:18:45.325]  Snipers are targeted.
[00:18:45.325 --> 00:18:46.806]  It's a very dangerous job.
[00:18:46.806 --> 00:18:48.007]  Highly skilled.
[00:18:48.007 --> 00:18:49.489]  I don't think snipers are cowards.
[00:18:49.489 --> 00:18:54.133]  I think they're some of the best people in the military when it comes to pure skills.
[00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:55.334]  But Chris Kyle...
[00:18:57.125 --> 00:18:59.267]  He did like to brag about killing people.
[00:18:59.267 --> 00:19:08.434]  He did show a lot of unsavory traits that I haven't seen in other operators that I personally know who will not talk about the people they've killed.
[00:19:08.434 --> 00:19:14.859]  And the system will purge people that have been willing servants of the system like Chris Kyle.
[00:19:14.859 --> 00:19:17.321]  Did he get a conscience at the end?
[00:19:17.321 --> 00:19:19.823]  Was he deciding that he was going to come clean?
[00:19:19.823 --> 00:19:21.224]  We'll never know.
[00:19:21.224 --> 00:19:22.806]  Because now, sitting there in the movie theater,
[00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:33.840]  At the end you get to see everyone cry when they show real footage of his funeral when he's buried like George Washington or something.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:42.450]  This is part of living in this modern propaganda state and people need to cut to the emotion and look at the cold hard truth.
[00:19:43.442 --> 00:19:46.384]  It's propaganda and lies that's killing America.
[00:19:46.384 --> 00:19:55.730]  A truly moral nation has the high ground and doesn't need disinformation, doesn't need brainwashing to convince the population to go along with the government.
[00:19:55.730 --> 00:20:00.713]  The truth is America has been captured by offshore globalist interests and we're losing our country.
[00:20:00.713 --> 00:20:09.299]  The real heroes are the men and women everywhere that stand up for our Bill of Rights and our Constitution and actually stand up for what the American flag symbolizes.
[00:20:09.299 --> 00:20:10.100]  As for Clint Eastwood,
[00:20:11.334 --> 00:20:13.863]  I hope this is just the fact that he's senile.
[00:20:13.863 --> 00:20:16.853]  But this film is so well done, I know that's not the truth.
[00:20:17.728 --> 00:20:22.931]  Clint Eastwood has decided to have the biggest hit of his life based on a lie.
[00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:25.272]  And in the end, I think it hurts his reputation.
[00:20:25.272 --> 00:20:27.913]  I think it hurts his legacy.
[00:20:27.913 --> 00:20:30.014]  And for that, I'm sad.
[00:20:30.014 --> 00:20:35.437]  Well, that's it for this extended breakdown tonight of American Sniper.
[00:20:35.437 --> 00:20:37.878]  I'll be back tomorrow live on the radio, 11 a.m.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:38.359]  to 2 p.m.
[00:20:38.359 --> 00:20:41.420]  Central Standard Time with the syndicated radio broadcast.
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:46.423]  And please, never forget, if you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:20:53.075 --> 00:20:59.217]  I got several calls late last night from bigwigs in Hollywood about this report.
[00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:03.958]  So they were watching it when it aired last night on the nightly news.
[00:21:03.958 --> 00:21:05.759]  So it's already making the rounds there.
[00:21:05.759 --> 00:21:11.420]  And it's because this attack is not just some jealous attack of the movie.
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.841]  It's a reluctant attack.
[00:21:14.841 --> 00:21:21.503]  It's a serious breakdown that only really scratches the surface, but still scratches it with a lot of truth.
[00:21:24.448 --> 00:21:30.774]  We have an article up on Infowars.com right now by Kurt Nemo.
[00:21:30.774 --> 00:21:39.602]  You heard my quote in that analysis piece saying that I don't agree with Michael Moore overall, saying snipers are cowards.
[00:21:39.602 --> 00:21:44.567]  I do agree that the Iraq war was a fraud and was bad and was based on a lie.
[00:21:46.428 --> 00:22:04.199]  As Michael Moore is saying, but Michael Moore doesn't criticize Obama for all the wars that he's continuing or turning Syria and Libya over to Al-Qaeda to engage in ethnic religious cleansing that is even more corrupt, premeditated and evil than the Iraq war.
[00:22:04.199 --> 00:22:08.822]  So what I don't like by the so-called left is that they're such despicable hypocrites.
[00:22:08.822 --> 00:22:15.387]  Of course, Kurt Nemo is an anti-war libertarian patriot and he has the article, Michael Moore is right.
[00:22:16.118 --> 00:22:17.158]  It's a provocative headline.
[00:22:17.158 --> 00:22:24.900]  He actually breaks down that Michael Moore is a globalist socialist, but that in his tweet overall he is correct.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:29.081]  But he had another tweet talking about snipers being cowards.
[00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:36.083]  That from Michael Moore who has six armed bodyguards but doesn't want citizens to be able to be armed.
[00:22:36.083 --> 00:22:41.885]  So I just don't think Michael Moore is a legitimate voice to criticize the military.
[00:22:41.885 --> 00:22:42.965]  I mean, he's got his First Amendment.
[00:22:44.494 --> 00:22:46.055]  I have my right.
[00:22:46.055 --> 00:22:48.796]  The left always spends disagreeing with him as hate speech.
[00:22:48.796 --> 00:22:51.097]  That's what Moore even says in his piece.
[00:22:51.097 --> 00:22:52.478]  Because someone calls him a traitor.
[00:22:52.478 --> 00:22:54.999]  Oh, that's hate speech now.
[00:22:54.999 --> 00:22:57.280]  Implying it's illegal like they've already made it in Europe.
[00:22:58.609 --> 00:23:02.910]  This is a guy that says that white people only want guns because they're racist.
[00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:14.132]  No, what's racist is not letting blacks have guns in Democrat-run black cities, like Chicago, New York, D.C., that have the highest crime rates in the United States, some cases the world.
[00:23:14.132 --> 00:23:16.453]  You talk about Chicago, and they can't have guns.
[00:23:16.453 --> 00:23:22.394]  I mean, this is all blaring, common-sense stuff, and the people are awake and understand what's happening.
[00:23:23.712 --> 00:23:36.157]  We're going to have at least three hours of live, in-studio, in this studio, coverage tonight, starting at 7 o'clock central, one hour before.
[00:23:36.157 --> 00:23:46.761]  We'll have the State of the Union with analysis and commentary by David Knight, Jakari Jackson, Leigh Ann McAdoo, Joe Beggs, Darren McBreen, and many others here in the crib.
[00:23:47.708 --> 00:23:58.382]  During the lengthy canned applause, by canned they just are supposed to, like lapdogs, clap to everything he's saying and not dare call any of it out as lies.
[00:24:00.011 --> 00:24:03.753]  Then there'll be at least an hour of analysis after.
[00:24:03.753 --> 00:24:08.136]  And we have a contact with what you could call anonymous.
[00:24:08.136 --> 00:24:19.142]  Now, quite frankly, anybody could be anonymous, but this particular contact we got from anonymous is definitely on the inside, definitely has big contacts throughout the hacking community.
[00:24:19.142 --> 00:24:27.707]  And we're going to have an announcement from the White Hat anonymous sector tonight.
[00:24:28.666 --> 00:24:30.828]  I'm not sure when we're going to air it, but we have it.
[00:24:30.828 --> 00:24:32.690]  That's coming up tonight.
[00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:34.932]  It's pretty powerful stuff.
[00:24:34.932 --> 00:24:37.194]  Between 7 and 10 central.
[00:24:37.194 --> 00:24:43.600]  And I've told the crew, if they want to go further, if they want to go longer, they're welcome to.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.083]  I could easily come up here tonight and dominate the whole thing.
[00:24:47.083 --> 00:24:50.886]  I did that last year and a lot of folks tuned in to watch it.
[00:24:51.892 --> 00:24:59.598]  Tonight, I'm going to sit back and let the crew conduct the special transmission.
[00:24:59.598 --> 00:25:02.561]  So, 7 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[00:25:02.561 --> 00:25:06.684]  We will also, on the front page of InfoWars.com, have a video box.
[00:25:06.684 --> 00:25:11.728]  Also, at InfoWars.com forward slash show, we'll have a free feed for everyone.
[00:25:11.728 --> 00:25:14.090]  The nightly news is subscription, generally.
[00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:20.275]  We've got to pay for the bandwidth and the computers and the crew and the camera folks and the analysis and investigative reporters.
[00:25:22.883 --> 00:25:23.444]  5.95 a month.
[00:25:23.444 --> 00:25:25.846]  It's actually right now $2.50 a month.
[00:25:25.846 --> 00:25:27.687]  The discount's going for the rest of the month.
[00:25:27.687 --> 00:25:32.311]  And then 20 people can use each membership, so that's 12 cents a person per month.
[00:25:32.311 --> 00:25:37.194]  If you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, it takes one minute to sign up.
[00:25:37.194 --> 00:25:42.879]  You're supporting the absolute very tip of the spear in the fight for Americana, Renaissance, basic freedom.
[00:25:44.304 --> 00:25:51.547]  Classical liberalism, the opposite of the socialist slash communist slash fascist implemented system.
[00:25:51.547 --> 00:25:59.230]  With fascists worldwide above it, tax exempt, with diplomatic immunity, using communist socialist tactics to domesticate the slave population.
[00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:00.090]  That's the real paradigm.
[00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:01.831]  And that paradigm continues to get out.
[00:26:01.831 --> 00:26:03.532]  It's game over for the globalists.
[00:26:03.532 --> 00:26:04.752]  Just it's game over.
[00:26:04.752 --> 00:26:13.797]  They've always sold opposition in Latin America, Asia and Africa, the Middle East as be a communist and then fight capitalism when this isn't capitalism we're living under.
[00:26:13.797 --> 00:26:16.139]  It is a crony insider system.
[00:26:16.139 --> 00:26:19.040]  You're always going to have a percentage of that in capitalism.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.782]  But now it's becoming the dominant sector.
[00:26:21.782 --> 00:26:26.824]  And it's why you've got one tenth of one percent, not one percent with half the wealth.
[00:26:26.824 --> 00:26:29.826]  And it's projected within five years to be 70 plus percent.
[00:26:30.762 --> 00:26:36.546]  Because they're waging financial war on the population.
[00:26:36.546 --> 00:26:37.607]  That's what's happening.
[00:26:37.607 --> 00:26:38.588]  That's what's unfolding.
[00:26:38.588 --> 00:26:44.132]  Now, what are we going to be covering today?
[00:26:44.132 --> 00:26:49.115]  I went to DrugsReport.com this morning at about 7 a.m.
[00:26:49.115 --> 00:26:55.220]  after I checked InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and I saw USA Today.
[00:26:57.159 --> 00:27:01.280]  The new headline is Humanoids Hold News Conference, Interview Baby.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:10.743]  But the previous top headline was, from USA Today, New Police Radars Can See Inside Homes.
[00:27:10.743 --> 00:27:18.745]  This very radar is in Police State 2 and Police State 3 from 2000 and 2003.
[00:27:21.658 --> 00:27:28.244]  I mean, in fact, I know the crew's working hard on this show and others, but if somebody can scan through those two films, I know I cover it multiple times.
[00:27:28.244 --> 00:27:39.154]  In fact, I show, if you're a TV viewer, this very device that is at least 20 years in action.
[00:27:40.287 --> 00:27:57.314]  This very device, when you go to USA Today or Infowars.com to link through, and you can watch the USA Today video, they did a video report on it, this very device has been around and been sold for at least 20 years.
[00:27:57.314 --> 00:28:02.897]  And they are now reporting that they just rolled it out last year, the FBI did.
[00:28:04.738 --> 00:28:12.323]  I'm not tooting my horn, but we covered this 15 years ago with the documents.
[00:28:12.323 --> 00:28:17.687]  And they're now announcing that it just started in the last couple years.
[00:28:17.687 --> 00:28:20.509]  It says 50 law enforcement agencies are using it.
[00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:22.030]  Here's the deal.
[00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:30.136]  If you're using this when you are going after a suspect and you think they're dangerous and they're in a building, then fine, use it.
[00:28:33.581 --> 00:28:34.942]  But that's not what's happening.
[00:28:34.942 --> 00:28:40.765]  They have mounted on helicopters now, stuff that gives them a black and white image in live time in your house.
[00:28:40.765 --> 00:28:45.287]  Doesn't just tell them where a person is or show them a basic image of where they are.
[00:28:45.287 --> 00:28:54.092]  So they're showing you 20-year-old technology that we've been documenting for 15 years and rolling it out.
[00:28:54.092 --> 00:28:59.114]  And I would tell people, the police are getting devices that see through your walls and they would laugh at me.
[00:28:59.114 --> 00:28:59.775]  Well, guess what?
[00:28:59.775 --> 00:29:01.756]  Google cars are getting mounted with these.
[00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:08.194]  But they're not just grabbing that data, they're grabbing your other data from all the quote, smart devices.
[00:29:08.194 --> 00:29:14.679]  The point is, this is a premeditated, organized, long-term program.
[00:29:14.679 --> 00:29:16.741]  Now, here's another report.
[00:29:16.741 --> 00:29:18.682]  The Next Frontier.
[00:29:18.682 --> 00:29:19.943]  Hacking your car.
[00:29:19.943 --> 00:29:21.545]  Oh see, the whole new problem.
[00:29:23.622 --> 00:29:26.143]  Is, oh, all these smart devices can be hacked.
[00:29:26.143 --> 00:29:27.264]  Oh my goodness.
[00:29:27.264 --> 00:29:30.566]  See how they set up the problem to offer the solution?
[00:29:30.566 --> 00:29:32.427]  Well, here's our article from two years ago.
[00:29:32.427 --> 00:29:38.310]  Microsoft denies new Xbox can see your genitals, though it can see through your walls.
[00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:41.832]  This is much worse than the police device, and it's in most your houses.
[00:29:41.832 --> 00:29:48.515]  Just like Samsung came out last year and said, yeah, we're listening to you in your house, quote, watch what you say.
[00:29:48.515 --> 00:29:49.916]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.916 --> 00:29:51.417]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.439 --> 00:29:55.131]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.178 --> 00:30:06.363]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:30:06.363 --> 00:30:08.705]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:30:08.705 --> 00:30:13.989]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:30:13.989 --> 00:30:19.153]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:30:19.153 --> 00:30:22.195]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:30:22.455 --> 00:30:26.537]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:30:26.537 --> 00:30:30.859]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:30:30.859 --> 00:30:41.085]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:30:41.085 --> 00:30:43.606]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,

[00:30:58.962 --> 00:31:02.464]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:31:02.464 --> 00:31:10.729]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:31:10.729 --> 00:31:16.133]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:32:15.632 --> 00:32:23.654]  You don't have to be a doctor to know the fall and winter months are the most dangerous time of year in North America when it comes to you and your family's health.
[00:32:23.894 --> 00:32:33.543]  Infowarslife.com is very excited to announce our biggest run yet of silver bullet colloidal silver exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.

[00:32:53.439 --> 00:32:53.779]  Silver Bullet.
[00:33:10.683 --> 00:33:15.066]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:15.066 --> 00:33:20.751]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:20.751 --> 00:33:39.985]  I wasn't sure it was going to be ready today, but they have basically completed the report, so we're going to break it today here on the radio slash TV broadcast, InfoWars Live, instead of tonight during extended three-hour live coverage of the State of the Union.
[00:33:41.761 --> 00:33:58.372]  And that is a story that was only picked up on in some trade publications and some governmental publications that contractors use to look for bids.
[00:33:58.372 --> 00:34:08.939]  You cannot make up how over the top the information is that we're going to break in the third hour.
[00:34:08.939 --> 00:34:10.980]  And Joe Biggs wanted to illustrate it
[00:34:13.072 --> 00:34:15.673]  And so I let him do it.
[00:34:15.673 --> 00:34:19.514]  Because he's the guy that basically ferreted out the news.
[00:34:19.514 --> 00:34:21.454]  It deals with veterans.
[00:34:21.454 --> 00:34:26.596]  So he also illustrates basically what's going on.
[00:34:26.596 --> 00:34:28.336]  But it is just over the top.
[00:34:28.336 --> 00:34:36.719]  And then we're going to continue our investigation basically undercover on this into the future.
[00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:40.580]  But it deals with the death panels of the veterans.
[00:34:41.627 --> 00:34:47.009]  And how they're on the death panels, and who decides who gets care and who doesn't.
[00:34:47.009 --> 00:34:57.632]  And I was sitting there last night looking at all these documents, and I actually began pinching myself like I was dreaming.
[00:34:57.632 --> 00:35:03.594]  I mean, I didn't really think I was dreaming, but I caught myself pinching myself, thinking, is this a dream?
[00:35:03.594 --> 00:35:06.955]  This is so evil.
[00:35:06.955 --> 00:35:08.115]  And it just goes on.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:13.961]  And it's just put out there like it's blase and no big deal.
[00:35:13.961 --> 00:35:25.223]  We go celebrate veterans, we go celebrate the archetypal warrior, the Chris Kyles, the Audie Murphys.
[00:35:25.223 --> 00:35:32.165]  And then we treat them worse than we would treat a dog.
[00:35:32.165 --> 00:35:37.146]  If humans can't be treated as good as an animal, we're in deep trouble.
[00:35:40.518 --> 00:35:46.080]  So, we're going to be airing that at the start of the third hour today.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:52.823]  I'm going to just leave it at that until we get to it, and I'm going to intro it.
[00:35:52.823 --> 00:35:57.165]  Then Anthony Gucciardi is going to be joining us in studio with some breaking news.
[00:35:57.165 --> 00:36:05.729]  I'll be honest with you, I'm not even looking forward, even though it'll be powerful radio and informative, to talking to Bill Ayers next hour.
[00:36:05.729 --> 00:36:08.010]  Because I want to be polite and classy,
[00:36:09.206 --> 00:36:21.294]  But at the same time, Nelling, and I'm going to have to sit there and listen to him, shovel BS in my direction, and in your direction is nauseating.
[00:36:21.294 --> 00:36:24.096]  Obama is to deliver his State of the Union tonight, obviously.
[00:36:24.096 --> 00:36:27.078]  And I'm going to talk some about that with Bill Ayers.
[00:36:29.901 --> 00:36:32.103]  Obama is a fraud within a fraud.
[00:36:32.103 --> 00:36:49.700]  He claims he's this free market guy, but then tells his constituents he's basically a commie, he's gonna deliver them all these free goods, and then what he delivers them is select corporate welfare to supplement their wages to work for these globalist combines who are busy de-industrializing and consolidating the economy.
[00:36:51.201 --> 00:37:00.127]  Insurance companies in the last two years, as we reported from the Japan Times and from the Davos Forum, have had their profits go up almost 50%.
[00:37:00.127 --> 00:37:02.308]  What was it?
[00:37:02.308 --> 00:37:06.491]  47% from Obamacare alone.
[00:37:06.491 --> 00:37:14.917]  Global insurance companies, the rape job of doubling or tripling prices, brought to you by a commie.
[00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.011]  Not a commie.
[00:37:18.011 --> 00:37:19.472]  Commie is their cover.
[00:37:19.472 --> 00:37:26.936]  Landing in giant planes with red carpets saying you can't have air conditioning or a car.
[00:37:26.936 --> 00:37:30.618]  Oh, we're going to have carbon taxes and transfer wealth to the poor people.
[00:37:30.618 --> 00:37:31.999]  You get the actual plan.
[00:37:31.999 --> 00:37:35.782]  It's basically doubling taxes on poor people.
[00:37:35.782 --> 00:37:38.043]  Worldwide.
[00:37:38.043 --> 00:37:44.127]  A veritable death sentence for people who spend half their money, their discretionary income on food.
[00:37:44.127 --> 00:37:46.148]  What happens when you double
[00:37:48.459 --> 00:37:49.620]  The taxes on them.
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.221]  They starve to death.
[00:37:51.221 --> 00:37:59.467]  30 million people a year, half of them children, it's estimated by the WHO at the UN.
[00:37:59.467 --> 00:38:03.230]  Starve to death.
[00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:15.740]  And when you get the Planned Parenthood documents, when you get the Roe v. Wade, that just came out, the lawyer that lives here in town, the actual woman that had the abortion, the actual woman who was in the case of Roe v. Wade,
[00:38:17.025 --> 00:38:36.457]  You know, as now a Christian has repented, but the lawyer who lives right here in Austin, who got it through, she was in the news last week with her letters to the President at the time, talking about, we've got to get rid of all these poor people.
[00:38:36.457 --> 00:38:39.339]  Just like Margaret Singer said, we've got to kill all these black people.
[00:38:39.339 --> 00:38:40.800]  I mean, I'm just so sick of it.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:46.484]  I'm so sick of knowing the facts, knowing the players, being informed, knowing their endgame.
[00:38:51.721 --> 00:38:59.668]  Here's some of our past articles dealing with x-rays that's now in USA Today today, shifting years back into what I was covering earlier in more detail.
[00:38:59.668 --> 00:39:04.773]  New York National Guard units scan vehicles for gun confiscation.
[00:39:04.773 --> 00:39:08.656]  Wednesday, July 7, 2010.
[00:39:08.656 --> 00:39:14.281]  PrisonPlanet.com, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:39:14.281 --> 00:39:17.925]  Police to get x-ray scanner for vehicle inspections and public safety.
[00:39:19.093 --> 00:39:22.796]  June of 2014, just to show that it's now proliferating.
[00:39:22.796 --> 00:39:27.060]  DHS to x-ray scan Americans at border checkpoints.
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:27.080]  2012.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:33.645]  TSA invades roads and highways with Viper checkpoints and x-ray systems.
[00:39:33.645 --> 00:39:34.446]  2011.
[00:39:34.446 --> 00:39:41.972]  TSA to roll out covert surveillance vans with x-rays and systems to see through walls.
[00:39:41.972 --> 00:39:42.273]  2013.
[00:39:42.273 --> 00:39:46.977]  And these are just stuff the last three or four years.
[00:39:48.386 --> 00:39:59.693]  I made four police state films, I know two of them, made in 2000, 2003, show this very scanner that USA Today has in their article today, that is a very primitive one.
[00:39:59.693 --> 00:40:17.484]  So deciphering that, getting the rest of the story, as Paul Harvey would say, good day, the full story, is they're rolling out, this is going to be used everywhere, and they show you on the news, the most primitive one,
[00:40:18.612 --> 00:40:24.875]  That just shows a basic human shaved through walls and the police can argue, hey, we're going after somebody, you know, that's shooting at us or whatever.
[00:40:24.875 --> 00:40:27.216]  This is a good way to know where they're at so we don't get killed.
[00:40:27.216 --> 00:40:29.678]  Makes perfect sense.
[00:40:29.678 --> 00:40:33.800]  But this is being rolled out in private corporate systems, governmental systems.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.641]  It's in satellites now.
[00:40:35.641 --> 00:40:40.143]  They've got basically sound wave technology and other systems.
[00:40:41.604 --> 00:40:45.946]  Radar systems that are so sensitive they shoot through the walls, resonate back.
[00:40:45.946 --> 00:40:57.392]  That's why Microsoft Kinect admits they can see through up to eight walls and people up to 400 yards away with an Xbox Kinect.
[00:40:57.392 --> 00:41:00.594]  That was three years ago that rolled out.
[00:41:00.594 --> 00:41:07.357]  And hackers and people demonstrated it by capturing the video feed of it.
[00:41:07.357 --> 00:41:08.838]  Kinect is spying on you.
[00:41:10.211 --> 00:41:13.053]  And again, scroll back up, I'll show folks that publication.
[00:41:13.053 --> 00:41:15.615]  Mainstream News.
[00:41:15.615 --> 00:41:16.736]  Gizmodo.
[00:41:16.736 --> 00:41:18.457]  The Washington Post.
[00:41:18.457 --> 00:41:20.539]  They're all reporting that.
[00:41:20.539 --> 00:41:23.041]  LazyGamer.net.
[00:41:23.041 --> 00:41:25.143]  We were the first to tell you this.
[00:41:25.143 --> 00:41:27.064]  And it's not, hey, we were first.
[00:41:27.064 --> 00:41:35.271]  It's, hey, it really gets old reporting on something 15 years before it's admitted because by the time they admit it,
[00:41:36.038 --> 00:41:43.120]  They're 10, 15 years ahead and have already got helicopters looking through your wall.
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:51.363]  The Xbox Kinect can look at the pores on your skin and biometrically recognizes you and your voice.
[00:41:51.363 --> 00:41:54.705]  And this is being rolled out on the new smart TVs everywhere.
[00:41:54.705 --> 00:41:56.485]  Remember?
[00:41:56.485 --> 00:42:04.228]  Remember three years ago, the head of the CIA, Petraeus, CIA chief, will spy on you through your dishwasher.
[00:42:05.828 --> 00:42:10.893]  I go on other radio and TV shows and I mention this and they laugh at me.
[00:42:10.893 --> 00:42:16.518]  I was on British radio a few years ago and in studio and they began laughing at me.
[00:42:16.518 --> 00:42:17.780]  See, it's so funny.
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.662]  I'm like, hey, even Betrayus admits that their
[00:42:21.673 --> 00:42:23.014]  Watching you through your dishwasher?
[00:42:23.014 --> 00:42:25.015]  Ha ha, that's ridiculous!
[00:42:25.015 --> 00:42:27.777]  But see, then it all comes out, and oh, well, that's acceptable now.
[00:42:27.777 --> 00:42:48.952]  They don't want this Intel known until it's already widespread, until it's ubiquitous, until the technology is in place, because they know you're then comfortable with the Samsung, or with the Sharp, or with every major brand is now putting in their terms of service data collected off this platform,
[00:42:50.356 --> 00:42:54.799]  Will be given, can and will be given to third parties for marketing and other reasons.
[00:42:54.799 --> 00:42:58.101]  And by turning this on and with your purchase, you accept.
[00:42:58.101 --> 00:42:59.682]  Click here for the system.
[00:42:59.682 --> 00:43:03.504]  You can't turn it off in the settings.
[00:43:03.504 --> 00:43:06.446]  Samsung went further four months ago, as I keep mentioning.
[00:43:08.422 --> 00:43:14.865]  There's the headline, Samsung Smart TV records, quote, personal conversations and sends them to third parties.
[00:43:14.865 --> 00:43:18.347]  New company's new privacy policy causes consternation.
[00:43:18.347 --> 00:43:23.709]  Paul Joseph Watson, November of last year.
[00:43:23.709 --> 00:43:29.052]  Because they say in their terms of service, watch what you say.
[00:43:29.052 --> 00:43:34.114]  We've got audio and video.
[00:43:34.114 --> 00:43:35.755]  We're just supposed to accept this now.
[00:43:35.755 --> 00:43:37.476]  This is how Orwellian it is.
[00:43:38.666 --> 00:43:40.788]  And I'm going to do this myself.
[00:43:40.788 --> 00:43:44.932]  Or if any of the crew's bold enough and wants to do it, just... We need to get this done.
[00:43:44.932 --> 00:43:51.197]  That's why I hired a big crew, or bigger crew, so we can actually carry out all these ideas, because I can't get them all done.
[00:43:51.197 --> 00:43:57.683]  We need to just go to people's doors, and then once they find out the truth, we just get them to sign a waiver and agree to it.
[00:43:57.683 --> 00:43:58.944]  That's how you get around the privacy issue.
[00:44:00.179 --> 00:44:02.541]  That's how they do it with the, you know, hidden TV cameras.
[00:44:02.541 --> 00:44:08.727]  Because a lot of folks will understand, they'll end up, you know, being aware of what's happening, and then we'll say, yeah, it's for TV, it's an article, we use this.
[00:44:08.727 --> 00:44:09.908]  Or we can just blur their faces.
[00:44:09.908 --> 00:44:24.781]  We need to go to people's doors and go, hey, we're here from television, InfoWars, and we'd like to plant cameras in your house, and we'd like to watch and listen to everything you do, and then give it to third parties and sell that data.
[00:44:24.781 --> 00:44:26.343]  And they'll say, get off my porch, you're crazy.
[00:44:27.267 --> 00:44:31.951]  And I'll say, but here's the policy report by Samsung.
[00:44:31.951 --> 00:44:33.773]  Do you have Samsung products?
[00:44:33.773 --> 00:44:36.615]  All their products for two years now have this.
[00:44:36.615 --> 00:44:41.980]  And if they're hooked into the internet as a quote, smart TV, they're watching everything you're doing.
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:42.960]  And they'll say, you're crazy.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.181]  And I'll say, no, here it is.
[00:44:44.181 --> 00:44:44.602]  They'll read it.
[00:44:44.602 --> 00:44:49.026]  I'll say, yeah, we did this to illustrate what's happening.
[00:44:49.026 --> 00:44:51.508]  Because you're upset at me wanting to do this.
[00:44:51.508 --> 00:44:52.709]  Let's go one step further.
[00:44:54.246 --> 00:45:04.792]  How about you pay me $3,000 to watch everything you do for the next five years while you have this television and sell that data to everyone?
[00:45:04.792 --> 00:45:08.474]  How about while you're having sex with your wife on the couch watching porn?
[00:45:08.474 --> 00:45:12.836]  How about we take that video and sell that on the open web?
[00:45:12.836 --> 00:45:16.899]  How about in your bedroom, even when you're not having sex?
[00:45:16.899 --> 00:45:19.160]  How about when you're on the toilet with your iPhone?
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.100]  How about we get that data?
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:20.741]  Because here's the deal.
[00:45:21.795 --> 00:45:26.359]  I've talked to not one, not two, not three, not four people in the last week.
[00:45:26.359 --> 00:45:30.002]  This didn't happen to me, but it happened to people I know, family.
[00:45:30.002 --> 00:45:40.470]  That their droids and iPhones, when state law went into place in Texas, that you can't talk on the phone anymore.
[00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:49.157]  You have to have a hands-free, that the phones automatically all went to voice print and began not letting them use them, but talking at them until they changed the settings.
[00:45:50.031 --> 00:45:50.411]  Guess what?
[00:45:50.411 --> 00:46:05.139]  I went and looked it up and saw talks going on a few years ago with different governments in Europe about the phones turning off when there's civil disobedience, turning off any time the police want them to, and just not working hands-held.
[00:46:05.139 --> 00:46:16.665]  They have new sensors in the Droids and the iPhones where they know if it's up to your head, they know if you're moving, they know where you're going, they know how many calories you've had, they know where you're, you know, those programs are all public.
[00:46:16.665 --> 00:46:17.626]  Those apps are all public.
[00:46:18.246 --> 00:46:22.288]  But do you see the other side of all this?
[00:46:22.288 --> 00:46:25.789]  Apple granted patent to disable cameras according to location.
[00:46:25.789 --> 00:46:26.609]  Three years ago.
[00:46:26.609 --> 00:46:29.930]  Infowars.com.
[00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:31.311]  This is not our opinion.
[00:46:31.311 --> 00:46:34.772]  This is the master plan.
[00:46:34.772 --> 00:46:38.874]  Where all this social engineering tech is built into everything.
[00:46:40.003 --> 00:46:45.387]  So it's so shocking now why the police have handheld systems and you watch the video.
[00:46:45.387 --> 00:46:47.749]  Oh, that's just kind of grainy black and white.
[00:46:47.749 --> 00:46:49.029]  There's a shooter in the building.
[00:46:49.029 --> 00:46:52.052]  Sounds reasonable.
[00:46:52.052 --> 00:46:59.857]  They always show you the old thing that's been in place for 20 years when the new stuff is beyond Orwell.
[00:46:59.857 --> 00:47:00.858]  So there's that tactic.
[00:47:04.844 --> 00:47:06.125]  You heard it here first.
[00:47:06.125 --> 00:47:09.587]  Government spies on innocent people via webcams, laptops, Xbox.
[00:47:09.587 --> 00:47:15.271]  Steve Watson links back to articles we wrote eight years ago in his 2014 article.
[00:47:15.271 --> 00:47:19.833]  He links to them and now it's admitted that NSA, GCHQ, and England and others
[00:47:20.874 --> 00:47:39.751]  In programs called OpticNerve, have AI watching you, and Google embedded in a patent 10 years ago that they were already, with audio, with the embedded microphones, listening for, say, if your dog barks, then ads for dog toys pop up.
[00:47:39.751 --> 00:47:40.592]  You read it here first.
[00:47:40.592 --> 00:47:43.154]  Google's ambient background spy tech.
[00:47:43.154 --> 00:47:43.234]  2012.
[00:47:43.234 --> 00:47:45.016]  We link back to our 2006 report.
[00:47:49.122 --> 00:47:50.943]  Alex Jones is that crazy guy!
[00:47:50.943 --> 00:47:56.666]  I remember I would have family and neighbors at my house and I would have webcams covered with a band-aid.
[00:47:56.666 --> 00:47:58.487]  And they'd say, why is that covered?
[00:47:58.487 --> 00:48:00.168]  And I'd say, oh, there's patents.
[00:48:00.168 --> 00:48:01.689]  They watch and listen over that.
[00:48:01.689 --> 00:48:06.171]  And the FBI without warrants dials into them all the time.
[00:48:06.171 --> 00:48:07.772]  They can also frame you with those cameras.
[00:48:10.404 --> 00:48:12.125]  And they went, man, you're nuts.
[00:48:12.125 --> 00:48:12.565]  Really?
[00:48:12.565 --> 00:48:13.086]  I'm nuts?
[00:48:13.086 --> 00:48:16.989]  And again, this isn't about Alex Jones being right and everybody else being wrong.
[00:48:16.989 --> 00:48:19.530]  It's about, we're still in this process.
[00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:25.454]  There is a global government putting fluoride in the water and GMO that kills the rats and you're eating it.
[00:48:25.454 --> 00:48:27.576]  Chuck Norris has now come out and warned people.
[00:48:27.576 --> 00:48:28.076]  Okay?
[00:48:28.076 --> 00:48:32.219]  I mean, this is going on, people.
[00:48:32.219 --> 00:48:33.580]  So, understand it.
[00:48:35.103 --> 00:48:40.307]  I don't care if you're a school teacher, an auto mechanic, a farmer, a factory worker, a police officer.
[00:48:40.307 --> 00:48:42.148]  I don't care who you are.
[00:48:42.148 --> 00:48:44.169]  Your family's being hit by this.
[00:48:44.169 --> 00:48:46.691]  And I know a lot of you are going to laugh right now.
[00:48:46.691 --> 00:48:52.495]  You're not going to laugh when your 12-year-old has that seizure and a month later is dead.
[00:48:52.495 --> 00:48:57.039]  You're not going to laugh as all of this unfolds.
[00:48:57.039 --> 00:48:59.340]  Understand that?
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:00.201]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:49:03.254 --> 00:49:05.194]  Still trying to figure out the studio.
[00:49:05.194 --> 00:49:06.715]  We never really did a briefing in here.
[00:49:06.715 --> 00:49:08.515]  Is the red light or the green light the camera I'm on?
[00:49:08.515 --> 00:49:14.377]  Green light's the one I'm on, right?
[00:49:14.377 --> 00:49:15.077]  That's what I thought.
[00:49:15.077 --> 00:49:19.458]  Ah, Jesus Christ.
[00:49:19.458 --> 00:49:20.298]  Just what's the point?
[00:49:20.298 --> 00:49:22.078]  The public just all wants to die.
[00:49:22.078 --> 00:49:22.639]  Fine!
[00:49:22.639 --> 00:49:23.979]  Enjoy yourselves, okay?
[00:49:23.979 --> 00:49:32.621]  Just drink fluoride, take the shots, eat the GMO, don't go look at the rat studies, don't go look at the guinea pig studies, just don't look at it!
[00:49:33.933 --> 00:49:37.996]  Let's go watch ESPN and act tough all day.
[00:49:37.996 --> 00:49:42.739]  The elite have told me the public doesn't care and doesn't want to be helped.
[00:49:42.739 --> 00:49:47.062]  But that's not really fair, because if you tried this on people in 1950, it wouldn't have flown.
[00:49:47.062 --> 00:49:49.223]  Or even 1960 or 70.
[00:49:49.223 --> 00:49:50.524]  It was incrementally done.
[00:49:50.524 --> 00:49:52.926]  People were set in front of televisions from birth.
[00:49:52.926 --> 00:49:55.388]  They were taught where they mix.
[00:49:55.388 --> 00:49:59.070]  Like Mark Dyson said yesterday, nuclear war is inevitable.
[00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:03.173]  Top scientist says, you know, next, uh, Teletubbies.
[00:50:06.325 --> 00:50:10.908]  I mean, they just come out and calmly announce, yeah, your television's watching you.
[00:50:10.908 --> 00:50:12.489]  The head of the CIA flaunts it.
[00:50:12.489 --> 00:50:13.190]  They just do it.
[00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:15.191]  It's all totally illegal.
[00:50:15.191 --> 00:50:17.033]  It's not done to protect us.
[00:50:17.033 --> 00:50:20.595]  Our government is totally corrupt, at the top.
[00:50:20.595 --> 00:50:23.157]  And now, Dr. Corsi comes out.
[00:50:23.157 --> 00:50:26.920]  Generals conclude Obama backed Al Qaeda.
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:35.226]  And it's a huge, thick, long article.
[00:50:36.167 --> 00:50:43.952]  With just generals and former CIA people, and all of them, admitting our government runs Al-Qaeda.
[00:50:43.952 --> 00:50:48.254]  It's just an amazing article, and it's just like, ah, so what?
[00:50:48.254 --> 00:50:50.135]  You know, so what?
[00:50:50.135 --> 00:50:58.500]  Well, when Al-Qaeda starts blowing stuff up, that's going to be used to take our liberties, so the system can take your pension funds.
[00:50:59.127 --> 00:51:01.308]  What good is a Big Berkey Water Filter?

[00:51:58.883 --> 00:52:00.804]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[00:52:00.804 --> 00:52:04.446]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[00:52:04.446 --> 00:52:05.787]  A pair of scissors.
[00:52:05.787 --> 00:52:11.590]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:16.513]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[00:52:16.513 --> 00:52:17.493]  The phone line.
[00:52:17.493 --> 00:52:22.756]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[00:52:22.756 --> 00:52:26.498]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[00:52:26.658 --> 00:52:29.962]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.

[00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:01.392]  This is a serious topic for all men.
[00:53:01.392 --> 00:53:05.836]  Every single man listening may have a prostate problem if he lives long enough.
[00:53:05.836 --> 00:53:06.256]  That's right.
[00:53:06.696 --> 00:53:14.259]  All of us men may suffer from a prostate problem, like urinating more often, waking at night to urinate, or problems with intimacy.

[00:53:28.164 --> 00:53:29.344]  Prostate problems may not be an issue of if,
[00:53:34.386 --> 00:53:36.587]  There can be an issue of when.
[00:53:36.587 --> 00:53:45.692]  Super Beta Prostate's ingredient is clinically shown to reduce urges to urinate, reduce waking at night to go, and help improve intimacy.

[00:53:48.473 --> 00:53:48.673]  Call 1-800-964-7470.
[00:54:06.812 --> 00:54:09.214]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:09.214 --> 00:54:15.740]  I call it InfoWars Live because it's really a radio show, but it's grown into a television transmission as well.
[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:19.063]  The radio format, you can find the free video feed 11 a.m.
[00:54:19.063 --> 00:54:19.544]  to 2 p.m.
[00:54:19.544 --> 00:54:23.107]  Central at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:54:24.328 --> 00:54:32.450]  And if you are an AM or FM listener, it is vital to tell friends and family in the area about the station and when the broadcast is aired.
[00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:42.933]  But if you have friends and family outside of the area, you can still tell them about the free iPhone, free Droid apps, free podcasts, free video feeds, and more at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:54:42.933 --> 00:54:48.234]  In fact, if folks would just sign off on their emails and on Facebook and Twitter every day
[00:54:48.934 --> 00:55:03.746]  With the free link to InfoWars.com forward slash show that would continue to grow even faster the seismic effect of the word-of-mouth grassroots power of you that power the resistance to the globalist.
[00:55:03.746 --> 00:55:06.628]  I am not even the tip of the spear.
[00:55:06.628 --> 00:55:09.891]  I'm close to the very tip but it really just hit me during the break.
[00:55:09.891 --> 00:55:10.832]  It is the listeners
[00:55:12.725 --> 00:55:22.534]  That propel the spear through the air and that are the shaft of the spear and the entire head of the spear, including the very tip.
[00:55:22.534 --> 00:55:32.103]  I am simply the human impetus that helped become a focal point for this operation.
[00:55:32.103 --> 00:55:34.425]  This is Ron Paul has said it, he's just a focal point.
[00:55:36.752 --> 00:55:41.077]  Just a focus point, and it's a great responsibility, and I'm very honored to be here.
[00:55:41.077 --> 00:55:44.882]  So please continue to tell people about InfoWars.com.
[00:55:44.882 --> 00:55:47.265]  Tell folks to go to just that link and listen to the radio show.
[00:55:47.265 --> 00:55:48.627]  Send them that link.
[00:55:48.627 --> 00:55:50.049]  Send them the podcast link.
[00:55:50.049 --> 00:55:54.094]  Send them YouTube videos or special reports we've done that you think are particularly powerful.
[00:55:55.435 --> 00:56:03.922]  We need to put annotations on all our YouTube videos saying go to infowars.com forward slash show to find the free video feed live.
[00:56:03.922 --> 00:56:06.944]  We need to reach out because they're wanting to censor the internet.
[00:56:06.944 --> 00:56:11.928]  They're wanting to launch an internet false flag to start shutting down the free web.
[00:56:11.928 --> 00:56:13.309]  It's all coming.
[00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:14.490]  It's all happening.
[00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:18.694]  The globalists are moving on every front because they know the time is short.
[00:56:18.694 --> 00:56:20.295]  They know the people are aware of them.
[00:56:21.937 --> 00:56:30.859]  You know, I had an idea when I saw this article this morning to get Dr. Jerome Corsi on the broadcast.
[00:56:30.859 --> 00:56:33.100]  PhD, political science, Harvard.
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:34.820]  Worked in a lot of secret operations.
[00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:36.840]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:39.301]  So secretive, he won't even say what he did.
[00:56:39.301 --> 00:56:42.242]  But I happen to know from sources, Corsi's high level.
[00:56:42.242 --> 00:56:44.122]  I mean, of course, that's obvious.
[00:56:44.122 --> 00:56:47.783]  But generals conclude Obama backed Al Qaeda.
[00:56:50.168 --> 00:56:52.729]  Generals conclude Obama backed Al Qaeda.
[00:56:52.729 --> 00:56:55.951]  We'll be naming those generals and more.
[00:56:55.951 --> 00:56:57.832]  Military expert finds U.S.
[00:56:57.832 --> 00:57:00.313]  switch sides in terror war.
[00:57:00.313 --> 00:57:02.514]  And I've been hearing this for about five years and didn't believe it.
[00:57:02.514 --> 00:57:04.735]  It's so over the top I couldn't even believe it.
[00:57:04.735 --> 00:57:11.619]  It appears the globalists have actually decided to go ahead and not just turn radical Islam loose as an excuse to blow up the Middle East.
[00:57:11.619 --> 00:57:16.341]  It looks like they're going to go ahead and turn them loose on Russia, Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa and let them take over.
[00:57:19.036 --> 00:57:20.336]  And this is really happening.
[00:57:20.336 --> 00:57:23.397]  We're in so much trouble.
[00:57:23.397 --> 00:57:27.818]  At this point, I just can't even... It's just ridiculous!
[00:57:27.818 --> 00:57:28.979]  I don't want war.
[00:57:28.979 --> 00:57:30.339]  I don't want a civil war.
[00:57:30.339 --> 00:57:31.019]  I want peace.
[00:57:31.019 --> 00:57:32.220]  I want prosperity.
[00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:35.501]  The New World Order hates America and hates freedom.
[00:57:35.501 --> 00:57:38.061]  And they tried to use us to build their world government.
[00:57:38.061 --> 00:57:40.422]  Now they're getting ready to the phases to be done with us, basically.
[00:57:42.679 --> 00:57:44.520]  My God, we're like lambs of the slaughter.
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:46.901]  We are so simple-minded, so naive.
[00:57:46.901 --> 00:57:48.582]  The public is so childlike.
[00:57:48.582 --> 00:57:56.666]  The average man will strut around a gym acting tough to other men, but wouldn't get in a fight, you know, would stick their toes in their legs if you called their bluff.
[00:57:56.666 --> 00:57:59.588]  How are those guys going to stand up against something like this?
[00:57:59.588 --> 00:58:03.690]  Well, they know the military are the only people trained to fight this.
[00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:07.012]  And that's why in all the real training, they're ready for a night of the long knives.
[00:58:08.931 --> 00:58:12.294]  My goodness, even the Washington Times is now saying Obama's with Al-Qaeda.
[00:58:12.294 --> 00:58:12.914]  Grant me that!
[00:58:12.914 --> 00:58:13.655]  This is incredible!
[00:58:13.655 --> 00:58:14.495]  It's coming out!
[00:58:14.495 --> 00:58:15.456]  Praise God!
[00:58:15.456 --> 00:58:19.039]  Maybe we can have an epiphany and turn this back.
[00:58:19.039 --> 00:58:23.322]  Like Saul on the road to Damascus.
[00:58:23.322 --> 00:58:25.244]  Saul of Tarsus.

[00:58:49.315 --> 00:58:52.978]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:58:52.978 --> 00:58:57.261]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:58:57.261 --> 00:58:59.043]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:58:59.043 --> 00:59:04.367]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[00:59:04.367 --> 00:59:06.909]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.

[00:59:18.837 --> 00:59:22.339]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:59:22.339 --> 00:59:30.604]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:30.604 --> 00:59:36.008]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:59:36.008 --> 00:59:38.529]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:59:51.207 --> 00:59:53.811]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.154 --> 01:00:09.997]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.997 --> 01:00:11.577]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.577 --> 01:00:13.118]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.118 --> 01:00:17.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:21.923]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.923 --> 01:00:24.124]  America has a normalcy bias.
[01:00:24.124 --> 01:00:28.987]  We've been trained to basically accept anything and everything out of these tyrants.
[01:00:29.907 --> 01:00:35.150]  But like putting paper on a hot stove, it'll brown, it'll crackle, it'll finally flash into flames.
[01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:40.132]  We are now reaching the flashpoint event horizon.
[01:00:40.132 --> 01:00:44.314]  I'll be quite frank, I don't have butterflies.
[01:00:44.314 --> 01:00:46.856]  I am physically ill.
[01:00:46.856 --> 01:00:51.058]  Thinking about Bill Ayers coming on in the next segment.
[01:00:51.058 --> 01:00:52.339]  I just know his whole M.O.
[01:00:52.339 --> 01:00:54.480]  I know the whole program.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:58.342]  And I know he'll just come on here and deny he works for the big mega rich to screw everybody over.
[01:01:00.126 --> 01:01:03.408]  Barack Obama and Obamacare meant to savage the hell out of poor people.
[01:01:03.408 --> 01:01:05.390]  I'm just so sick of these people.
[01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:06.891]  God Almighty.
[01:01:06.891 --> 01:01:09.492]  It'd be bad enough if they were just dumb communists, but they're not.
[01:01:09.492 --> 01:01:11.374]  They know full well what they're doing.
[01:01:11.374 --> 01:01:13.455]  They decided to cheat humanity.
[01:01:13.455 --> 01:01:19.019]  They decided to screw everyone over.
[01:01:19.019 --> 01:01:21.881]  Let's play a great American who just died last year.
[01:01:23.476 --> 01:01:43.466]  Larry Grathwald, Vietnam veteran, Green Beret, 101st Airborne Division, former FBI Weather Underground informant who quoted Obama, confidant and former leader of the Weather Underment is stating that those Americans who could not be re-educated in communist camps or the revolution will be eliminated in mal-cultural revolution style.
[01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:46.427]  And he wrote the book, Bringing Down America, and he's dead.
[01:01:46.427 --> 01:01:50.089]  Larry101stblogspot.com.
[01:01:50.089 --> 01:01:52.370]  Let's go to a clip of a man speaking from the grave.
[01:01:53.231 --> 01:02:00.316]  They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called the counter-revolution.
[01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:12.706]  And they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest.
[01:02:12.706 --> 01:02:19.010]  Where we would take all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them
[01:02:20.504 --> 01:02:22.726]  How things were going to be.
[01:02:22.726 --> 01:02:26.349]  I asked, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate?
[01:02:26.349 --> 01:02:30.172]  That are die-hard capitalists?
[01:02:30.172 --> 01:02:34.235]  And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[01:02:34.235 --> 01:02:42.682]  And when I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[01:02:42.682 --> 01:02:44.304]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[01:02:45.975 --> 01:02:47.536]  25 million people.
[01:02:47.536 --> 01:03:09.206]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people, most of which have graduate degrees from Columbia and other well-known educational centers, and hear them figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people.
[01:03:09.206 --> 01:03:10.927]  And they were dead serious.
[01:03:12.947 --> 01:03:15.728]  That's from 1982, the documentary, No Place to Hide.
[01:03:15.728 --> 01:03:22.291]  And I have been in the room with high-level communists that I didn't know were communists that I got out here to interview.
[01:03:22.291 --> 01:03:24.172]  Famous people, I'm not getting into it.
[01:03:24.172 --> 01:03:26.253]  Rob Dewe witnessed it once.
[01:03:26.253 --> 01:03:28.854]  And that same crap sort of coming out of their mouth.
[01:03:28.854 --> 01:03:30.135]  And that we better join them and stuff.
[01:03:33.103 --> 01:03:34.744]  Too bad we got guns.
[01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:35.705]  Second Amendment.
[01:03:35.705 --> 01:03:37.626]  Doesn't matter how big a tyranny you bring in.
[01:03:37.626 --> 01:03:39.287]  No matter how many false flags.
[01:03:39.287 --> 01:03:44.990]  Even if you get the Civil War kicked off with the police to wipe them out and wipe most of us out.
[01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:45.931]  We're not stupid.
[01:03:45.931 --> 01:03:47.352]  We've got your game.
[01:03:47.352 --> 01:03:50.954]  Denying your program doesn't work anymore with us.
[01:03:50.954 --> 01:03:53.936]  So just be advised.
[01:03:53.936 --> 01:03:56.877]  Be advised big time.
[01:03:56.877 --> 01:04:00.359]  That we know what's going on and we're warning people.
[01:04:00.359 --> 01:04:02.741]  And we're going to continue to warn people and we've got the jump on you.
[01:04:04.855 --> 01:04:16.304]  If we go through this though, it's going to make some of the major wars and things that have happened in this country before the Civil War look like a shadow of what's coming in this country.
[01:04:16.304 --> 01:04:20.907]  The entire homeland security apparatus is now focused on the counter-revolution.
[01:04:20.907 --> 01:04:24.370]  Gun owners, veterans, conservatives, libertarians, patriots.
[01:04:24.370 --> 01:04:27.092]  Hard working people that make this country operate and run.
[01:04:31.909 --> 01:04:35.492]  They thought it couldn't happen in Germany, or Russia, or China, or a hundred other countries.
[01:04:35.492 --> 01:04:38.735]  Plus, we think it can't happen here?
[01:04:38.735 --> 01:04:41.477]  Baby, it is happening.
[01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:44.960]  Our borders are gone, our country is being bankrupted by design.
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:50.866]  World planetary fascist government, with a bunch of communists under it, is taking hold.
[01:04:50.866 --> 01:04:54.829]  Just as Gary Allen warned in 1972, and none dare call it conspiracy.
[01:04:59.474 --> 01:05:04.075]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[01:05:04.075 --> 01:05:10.456]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[01:05:10.456 --> 01:05:19.858]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.

[01:05:47.015 --> 01:05:48.156]  But for how long?
[01:05:48.156 --> 01:05:50.376]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:05:50.376 --> 01:05:54.797]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:05:54.797 --> 01:05:56.658]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:05:56.658 --> 01:05:57.618]  Just won't quit.
[01:05:59.184 --> 01:06:08.168]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[01:06:08.168 --> 01:06:18.153]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[01:06:18.713 --> 01:06:25.142]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:06:25.142 --> 01:06:31.531]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimentical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:06:31.531 --> 01:06:34.715]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections and
[01:06:35.015 --> 01:06:40.137]  Adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[01:06:40.137 --> 01:06:43.197]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:06:43.197 --> 01:06:44.738]  No needles, no injections.
[01:06:44.738 --> 01:06:46.138]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:06:46.138 --> 01:06:47.339]  Try it for yourself.
[01:06:47.339 --> 01:06:48.659]  Discover the secret.
[01:06:48.659 --> 01:06:49.759]  Secret 12.
[01:06:49.759 --> 01:06:52.080]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[01:06:59.187 --> 01:07:00.447]  Another major health threat.
[01:07:00.447 --> 01:07:05.408]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:07:05.408 --> 01:07:08.089]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:07:08.089 --> 01:07:15.130]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:18.111]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:07:18.111 --> 01:07:21.071]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:23.091]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:07:23.091 --> 01:07:25.952]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:07:26.032 --> 01:07:31.754]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:07:31.754 --> 01:07:35.255]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:07:35.255 --> 01:07:38.356]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:07:38.356 --> 01:07:45.659]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[01:07:45.659 --> 01:07:48.880]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[01:07:57.764 --> 01:08:09.373]  A bomb exploded early this morning in the Pentagon, and left-wing terrorists telephoned newspapers to say they were responsible.
[01:08:09.373 --> 01:08:20.582]  At midday, the Associated Press got a phone call from a man saying he was with the Weather Underground, and that bombs would explode at the Departments of Interior and Agriculture and the Smithsonian before the day was out.
[01:08:20.922 --> 01:08:28.624]  People calling themselves members of the Weather Underground last night planted bombs in federal office buildings in Washington and Oakland, California.
[01:08:28.624 --> 01:08:35.646]  Credit for the Capitol bombing was claimed in a letter received by the Associated Press today signed by the Weather Underground.
[01:08:35.646 --> 01:08:42.788]  The explosion destroyed one of the Pentagon's 140 women's restrooms and blasted out a wall on the fourth floor.
[01:08:42.788 --> 01:08:48.209]  They estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[01:08:48.209 --> 01:08:49.830]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[01:08:51.092 --> 01:08:57.593]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:57.593 --> 01:09:12.036]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into the second hour of this worldwide broadcast, and I've got to hand it to him, joining us here on the 20th day of January 2015 on this Tuesday.
[01:09:12.036 --> 01:09:20.117]  Bill Ayers, you can say what you want about him, he is more than happy to go out and debate people that I guess he disagrees with.
[01:09:20.928 --> 01:09:30.156]  And he's the former head of the Weather Underground Distinguished Professor of Education and Senior University Scholar at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
[01:09:30.156 --> 01:09:34.300]  I'm not going to go over all the things that he's been involved in.
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.983]  Ayers has written extensively about social justice.
[01:09:37.583 --> 01:09:45.788]  Democracy and education, the cultural context of schooling and teaching, as an essential intellectual, ethical, and political enterprise.
[01:09:45.788 --> 01:09:56.054]  He is a former vice president of the Curriculum Division of the American Educational Research Association, a member of the Executive Committee of AERA Council.
[01:09:56.054 --> 01:09:58.455]  His articles have appeared in the Harvard Educational Review.
[01:09:58.455 --> 01:09:59.896]  I'm not going to go over all of it.
[01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:02.678]  BillAyers.org.
[01:10:02.678 --> 01:10:04.179]  And I think what I want to do today
[01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:19.503]  Is just let him have the floor the first 3, 4, 5 minutes and say what he has to say because we were reached out to first by some of his people and I'm glad this discussion or debate is now finally happening.
[01:10:19.503 --> 01:10:23.547]  They wanted to talk about Common Core, education, things like that.
[01:10:23.547 --> 01:10:24.668]  That's fine.
[01:10:24.668 --> 01:10:26.009]  I want to get into Obama.
[01:10:26.912 --> 01:10:28.593]  And the legacy.
[01:10:28.593 --> 01:10:30.093]  I mean, I know Ayers was his mentor.
[01:10:30.093 --> 01:10:34.415]  I think Obama even lived with him for a while, and he can correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:10:34.415 --> 01:10:39.157]  And so, I mean, is Obama the messianic socialist leader they thought would come?
[01:10:39.157 --> 01:10:42.439]  Or will that be another?
[01:10:42.439 --> 01:10:43.759]  I mean, was Mao the messiah?
[01:10:43.759 --> 01:10:44.279]  Was it Lenin?
[01:10:44.279 --> 01:10:44.940]  Was it Stalin?
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:47.663]  I want to understand this.
[01:10:47.663 --> 01:10:49.004]  So Bill Ayers joins us.
[01:10:49.004 --> 01:10:55.513]  We'll also ask him about Larry Grathwald, the FBI informant, and that clip you just heard.
[01:10:55.513 --> 01:10:58.477]  Does he say that's true or is that not true?
[01:10:58.477 --> 01:11:01.981]  So Bill Ayers, thank you so much for coming on with us today.
[01:11:01.981 --> 01:11:03.163]  Again, BillAyers.org.
[01:11:05.418 --> 01:11:07.059]  Thank you very much.
[01:11:07.059 --> 01:11:08.780]  Well, where do you want to start?
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:10.481]  Well, let me correct a couple of things.
[01:11:10.481 --> 01:11:20.507]  One, I don't have any people who could have reached out to you because I'm just a retired professor and I write and I take care of my grandchildren, but
[01:11:21.027 --> 01:11:22.328]  Well, how did you end up getting on the show?
[01:11:22.328 --> 01:11:25.029]  Because I remember months ago... I have no idea.
[01:11:25.029 --> 01:11:27.131]  Somebody called me and said, would you do it?
[01:11:27.131 --> 01:11:28.652]  And I said, sure.
[01:11:28.652 --> 01:11:29.272]  That's number one.
[01:11:29.272 --> 01:11:32.354]  Number two, I was never the leader of the Weather Underground.
[01:11:32.354 --> 01:11:38.638]  I was one of the people who founded the faction within Students for a Democratic Society that became the Weather Underground.
[01:11:38.638 --> 01:11:42.540]  Number three, I was never a mentor to Barack Obama.
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:44.521]  He certainly never lived with me.
[01:11:44.521 --> 01:11:46.282]  He was a guy around the neighborhood.
[01:11:46.282 --> 01:11:49.804]  He's somebody I knew for many years, and I know it's been a big
[01:11:50.985 --> 01:11:58.048]  Trope among some people on the right that somehow Barack Obama is not what he appears.
[01:11:58.048 --> 01:12:00.989]  He's got this black nationalist minister Jeremiah, right?
[01:12:00.989 --> 01:12:11.933]  He's got this Palestinian friend, and he's got me who apparently ghost wrote his books all of that is false It's all silly and if you just take a minute to think about it.
[01:12:11.933 --> 01:12:17.595]  It's somewhat ridiculous So do you want to talk about Obama the past history education?
[01:12:17.595 --> 01:12:18.536]  Where do you want to begin Alex?
[01:12:19.195 --> 01:12:28.280]  Well, first off, because I don't want to get sidetracked on my anusia, I think you were here in town a while back, from memory, and then wanted to... What town are you in?
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:29.401]  Austin, Texas.
[01:12:29.401 --> 01:12:31.562]  Yeah, I was in Austin not so long ago.
[01:12:31.562 --> 01:12:36.205]  And I think it was one of the people that brought you there that contacted us and said, hey, would you want to debate him?
[01:12:36.205 --> 01:12:38.186]  And we're like, oh yeah, that's going to happen.
[01:12:38.186 --> 01:12:39.767]  So that's cleared up there.
[01:12:39.767 --> 01:12:41.308]  OK, all right, good.
[01:12:41.308 --> 01:12:47.232]  But all of that aside here, then let me just start with communism itself, because
[01:12:48.052 --> 01:12:57.099]  Most communists say they're socialist, but then when you get around them in person, they start telling you about violent overthrows and the plan to take over.
[01:12:57.099 --> 01:13:04.304]  Do you endorse the type of communism we saw in Russia, in China, or how would you really describe yourself?
[01:13:05.063 --> 01:13:07.684]  Well, the answer to your question is no.
[01:13:07.684 --> 01:13:10.906]  But, you know, I've been a person my whole life as an educator.
[01:13:10.906 --> 01:13:14.847]  I've opposed the notion of labeling people in a simple-minded way.
[01:13:14.847 --> 01:13:16.668]  But yes, I am opposed to capitalism.
[01:13:16.668 --> 01:13:19.329]  I think capitalism is a predatory system.
[01:13:19.329 --> 01:13:23.611]  I think it's a system that leads to racism, exploitation, etc.
[01:13:23.611 --> 01:13:25.892]  So yes, I'm anti-capitalist.
[01:13:25.892 --> 01:13:29.614]  And I am in favor of participatory democracy, which has been true my
[01:13:30.034 --> 01:13:30.114]  It's
[01:13:49.364 --> 01:13:50.545]  The economy.
[01:13:50.545 --> 01:13:53.848]  I tend towards socialism of a democratic nature.
[01:13:53.848 --> 01:13:58.552]  In terms of the government, I'm more of an anarchist or a left libertarian than anything else.
[01:13:58.552 --> 01:14:02.356]  So it's hard to put a single label and say, well, this is what you represent.
[01:14:02.356 --> 01:14:03.276]  No, it's not true.
[01:14:03.276 --> 01:14:09.242]  But I am definitely, I believe that we need more democracy in any democracy.
[01:14:09.242 --> 01:14:12.865]  The solution to our problems is more democracy, more participation.
[01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:13.866]  So that's what I fight for.
[01:14:16.127 --> 01:14:17.788]  Let's come at it from this angle then.
[01:14:17.788 --> 01:14:26.135]  Have you changed, or how have your views changed since you were one of the core people in the Weather Underground versus 2015?
[01:14:26.135 --> 01:14:30.498]  Well, I mean, I'm now 70 years old, so of course I've changed.
[01:14:30.498 --> 01:14:32.180]  I change every day, as you do.
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:33.881]  And all of us change.
[01:14:33.881 --> 01:14:38.823]  But in terms of fundamental values, I am deeply opposed to war.
[01:14:38.823 --> 01:14:41.104]  I'm deeply opposed to imperialism.
[01:14:41.104 --> 01:14:43.546]  I'm deeply opposed to white supremacy.
[01:14:43.546 --> 01:14:49.169]  I've been an ally of and fighter for the Black Freedom Movement and for anti-colonial struggles.
[01:14:49.169 --> 01:14:51.890]  So in that sense, I haven't changed.
[01:14:51.890 --> 01:14:58.233]  I think the wars that we're involved in now are catastrophic, not just for the rest of the world, but for America itself.
[01:14:58.233 --> 01:14:59.174]  And I think that we should
[01:15:00.194 --> 01:15:03.015]  In that sense, I don't know where you stand on any of these issues.
[01:15:03.015 --> 01:15:03.915]  I've never talked to you.
[01:15:03.915 --> 01:15:06.356]  I've never read anything you've written.
[01:15:06.356 --> 01:15:07.776]  I've never heard your show.
[01:15:07.776 --> 01:15:16.539]  But I'm wondering, are you closer to Rand Paul when it comes to militarism, or are you closer to John McCain?
[01:15:16.539 --> 01:15:18.299]  Oh, I'd be Ron Paul.
[01:15:18.299 --> 01:15:20.780]  So you've got Ron Paul over on the Libertarian end.
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:22.980]  You've got his son, unfortunately, moving towards the middle.
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:25.681]  And you've got John McCain completely mentally ill and in shame.
[01:15:26.294 --> 01:15:27.054]  Well, exactly.
[01:15:27.054 --> 01:15:29.556]  So in that sense, we have a point of unity.
[01:15:29.556 --> 01:15:34.579]  Because I think we should close all foreign military bases, as Rand Paul does.
[01:15:34.579 --> 01:15:37.441]  I think that we should downsize the Pentagon by about 90%.
[01:15:37.441 --> 01:15:40.803]  I think we should stop the war industry.
[01:15:40.803 --> 01:15:45.726]  I think we should stop arming the dictators and petty fascists all over the world.
[01:15:45.726 --> 01:15:51.829]  I think we should become a nation among nations, not the Uber nation, not the controller of everything.
[01:15:51.829 --> 01:15:54.631]  So in that sense, Alex, we've already found a point of unity.
[01:15:55.916 --> 01:16:00.198]  What is your view of Barack Obama, then?
[01:16:00.198 --> 01:16:02.779]  I've always had the same view of Barack Obama.
[01:16:02.779 --> 01:16:05.301]  As long as I've known him, I've known him for a long, long time.
[01:16:05.301 --> 01:16:19.467]  Barack Obama, as he said of himself in the 2008 campaign, and as he's defined himself all through his political life, he says of himself, I'm a moderate, middle-of-the-road, pragmatic, compromising politician.
[01:16:19.467 --> 01:16:20.808]  That's who he said he is.
[01:16:20.808 --> 01:16:22.049]  That's who he is.
[01:16:22.049 --> 01:16:24.410]  The right wing looked at him and said, no, he's not that.
[01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:25.290]  Are you kidding?
[01:16:25.290 --> 01:16:27.751]  You're talking about free community college and open borders?
[01:16:45.998 --> 01:16:46.158]  Sure.
[01:16:46.158 --> 01:16:46.579]  Hey, Bill Ayers.
[01:16:46.579 --> 01:16:47.460]  Bill Ayers is our guest.
[01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:48.361]  Professor Ayers.
[01:16:48.361 --> 01:16:49.742]  Look, very good tactics about
[01:17:01.496 --> 01:17:03.297]  Getting a point of unity.
[01:17:03.297 --> 01:17:10.720]  Why, if you were a Green Beret in a village, with the village elders having a debate, you'd find that first point of unity, common ground.
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:12.821]  In a month, you'd have them fighting for you.
[01:17:12.821 --> 01:17:14.082]  And I understand that.
[01:17:14.082 --> 01:17:15.723]  But you're not a Green Beret.
[01:17:15.723 --> 01:17:18.264]  You fight for a different army.
[01:17:18.264 --> 01:17:18.984]  Who funds you?
[01:17:18.984 --> 01:17:22.666]  Because I've read you're connected to the Ford Foundation, Carnegie, and others.
[01:17:22.666 --> 01:17:24.447]  Have you ever gotten any funding from those guys?
[01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:26.930]  Never, and I don't even know what that means.
[01:17:26.930 --> 01:17:27.791]  Who funds me?
[01:17:27.791 --> 01:17:29.173]  I'm a retired professor.
[01:17:29.173 --> 01:17:32.337]  I live modestly like other retired professors.
[01:17:32.337 --> 01:17:33.178]  I'm not sure what you mean.
[01:17:33.178 --> 01:17:41.268]  You're saying there's not a CIA program back to the 50s to fund liberation theology that I know you're fully aware of at university campuses?
[01:17:42.549 --> 01:17:46.950]  I hear your paranoia eking through, but I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:50.031]  Liberation theology has nothing to do with campuses.
[01:17:50.031 --> 01:17:52.311]  It's a movement within the Catholic Church.
[01:17:52.311 --> 01:17:54.231]  Is it a left-wing movement in the Catholic Church?
[01:17:54.231 --> 01:17:54.811]  Yes, it is.
[01:17:54.811 --> 01:17:56.552]  Does it come out of Brazil?
[01:17:56.552 --> 01:17:57.032]  It does.
[01:17:57.032 --> 01:18:01.893]  Does Pope Francis to some extent, is he to some extent influenced by that?
[01:18:01.893 --> 01:18:02.813]  Apparently he is.
[01:18:02.813 --> 01:18:03.333]  Oh boy.
[01:18:03.333 --> 01:18:05.213]  That has to do with me.
[01:18:05.213 --> 01:18:07.234]  Are you excited about Pope Francis and his
[01:18:08.354 --> 01:18:09.915]  Liberation theology?
[01:18:09.915 --> 01:18:12.778]  It's hard for me to get excited about a Pope.
[01:18:12.778 --> 01:18:18.702]  I know that for those of you who are Catholic, he's infallible, so I guess the Catholics must be excited about him.
[01:18:18.702 --> 01:18:27.890]  I think that when he says, who am I to judge, and when he opens himself to the possibility of greater freedom for women, I think those are good things.
[01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:30.052]  And of course, carbon taxes for George Soros, though.
[01:18:31.022 --> 01:18:32.764]  I'm not sure what that means, Alex.
[01:18:32.764 --> 01:18:37.708]  I mean, I know you've got a big paranoid background that's somewhere bubbling up, but I don't understand.
[01:18:37.708 --> 01:18:39.209]  I thought you don't know who I am.
[01:18:39.209 --> 01:18:40.290]  Hold on a minute.
[01:18:40.290 --> 01:18:41.591]  A big paranoid background.
[01:18:41.591 --> 01:18:45.434]  Mao killed 84 million people, according to the Chinese government.
[01:18:45.434 --> 01:18:47.536]  The CIA says 60 million.
[01:18:47.536 --> 01:18:49.998]  Are you saying that I shouldn't be worried about communism?
[01:18:50.777 --> 01:18:51.958]  I didn't say that at all.
[01:18:51.958 --> 01:18:53.598]  You said something about George Soros.
[01:18:53.598 --> 01:18:55.399]  I don't know anything about George Soros.
[01:18:55.399 --> 01:18:57.340]  Alright, let me ask you this.
[01:18:57.340 --> 01:18:58.941]  I don't know what you're drawing on.
[01:18:58.941 --> 01:19:01.582]  You know nothing about George Soros!
[01:19:01.582 --> 01:19:06.565]  I said, when you say this is a George Soros connection to Pope Francis, I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:19:06.565 --> 01:19:07.305]  No, I wasn't saying that.
[01:19:07.305 --> 01:19:12.688]  I was about to get into asking you about George Soros, who is funding Liberation Theology.
[01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:16.290]  Does George Soros support Liberation Theology?
[01:19:16.290 --> 01:19:17.130]  I have no idea.
[01:19:17.130 --> 01:19:23.093]  I don't know much about Liberation Theology and I know nothing about George Soros except what I read occasionally in the newspapers.
[01:19:23.093 --> 01:19:29.015]  Well, I mean, community organizing, stirring up groups, that's basically domestic Liberation Theology.
[01:19:29.015 --> 01:19:30.196]  Reverend Wright was a Liberator.
[01:19:30.196 --> 01:19:31.676]  Dude, slow down!
[01:19:31.676 --> 01:19:33.177]  That's Liberation Theology!
[01:19:33.917 --> 01:19:36.419]  Community organizing is stirring up groups?
[01:19:36.419 --> 01:19:37.800]  What's wrong with community organizing?
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.001]  Well no, that's a name.
[01:19:40.001 --> 01:19:45.805]  Radicalizing people has then been named community organizing and is funded by the big billionaires to destabilize.
[01:19:45.805 --> 01:19:48.787]  Well listen, I want you to have a counterpoint to that when we come back.
[01:19:48.787 --> 01:19:50.688]  Bill Ayers is our guest.
[01:19:50.688 --> 01:19:51.669]  It is very interesting.
[01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:54.010]  BillAyers.org.
[01:19:54.010 --> 01:19:54.611]  Stay with us.
[01:19:59.246 --> 01:20:02.947]  Did you go to Guns80.com and get your AR-15 yet?
[01:20:02.947 --> 01:20:10.089]  I took my buddy Mark out to lunch the other day to thank him for turning me on to Guns80.com and suddenly our old pal Dan showed up and joined us.
[01:20:10.089 --> 01:20:24.853]  Of course, Mark immediately started selling him on the great deals at Guns80.com and told him how you can buy a brand new rifle at a great price, keep your privacy, and how it can be delivered right to your front door, and that there was no visit to a gun dealer involved, there are no government papers to fill out,
[01:20:25.373 --> 01:20:26.835]  Dan was such an easy sell.
[01:20:26.835 --> 01:20:32.061]  He just pulled out his iPhone right there and went to Guns80.com and ordered his Ghost AR.
[01:20:32.061 --> 01:20:33.142]  Wow!
[01:20:33.142 --> 01:20:35.164]  You can call Guns80.com right now.
[01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:35.965]  Their number is 844-2GUNS80.
[01:20:35.965 --> 01:20:36.285]  That's 844-248-6780.
[01:20:36.285 --> 01:20:38.268]  By the way, demand they pay market commission, okay?
[01:20:45.035 --> 01:20:51.081]  Call Guns80.com at 844-2GUNS80 and demand they pay Mark, please.
[01:20:51.081 --> 01:20:52.802]  He deserves a commission.
[01:20:52.802 --> 01:20:58.087]  Go to 844-2GUNS80 and get your Ghost AR-15 on the web at Guns80.com.
[01:20:58.087 --> 01:20:59.008]  Go now!
[01:20:59.008 --> 01:21:01.810]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:21:01.810 --> 01:21:03.552]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk.
[01:21:03.752 --> 01:21:06.913]  In his team of Patriots over at My Patriot Supply.
[01:21:06.913 --> 01:21:15.035]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:21:15.035 --> 01:21:19.556]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:21:19.556 --> 01:21:23.537]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:21:23.537 --> 01:21:29.218]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:21:29.458 --> 01:21:32.640]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:38.003]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[01:21:38.003 --> 01:21:46.188]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:21:46.188 --> 01:21:46.509]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:21:46.509 --> 01:21:49.390]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[01:21:49.390 --> 01:21:50.351]  MyPatriotSupply.com slash Alex.
[01:21:58.516 --> 01:22:00.697]  What good is a Big Berkey Water Filter?
[01:22:28.736 --> 01:22:33.579]  At only 1.7 cents a gallon, a single set of filters can last for 5 to 10 years.
[01:22:33.579 --> 01:22:35.360]  That means big savings.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:39.802]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[01:22:39.802 --> 01:22:43.024]  Get a Big Berkey today at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.

[01:22:48.547 --> 01:22:48.947]  That's 877-99-BERKEY.
[01:22:48.947 --> 01:22:50.608]  Big Berkey Water Filters, for the love of clean water.
[01:22:58.635 --> 01:23:03.078]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:07.921]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[01:23:07.921 --> 01:23:11.984]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease.
[01:23:11.984 --> 01:23:15.406]  And a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[01:23:15.646 --> 01:23:18.307]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[01:23:18.307 --> 01:23:22.768]  I've taken whey protein products for years and I've never noticed the results I have with your product.
[01:23:22.768 --> 01:23:25.948]  I've suffered with thoughts of constipation most of my life.
[01:23:25.948 --> 01:23:30.069]  Within a few days of taking One World Whey, I noticed a dramatic change.
[01:23:30.069 --> 01:23:34.190]  Also in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[01:23:34.190 --> 01:23:37.631]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[01:23:38.251 --> 01:23:41.893]  For the past week or so, I'm not feeling bad anymore, and the foot pain is gone.
[01:23:41.893 --> 01:23:43.675]  I'm just finishing up a five-pound tuff.
[01:23:43.675 --> 01:23:46.256]  I ordered it and just got off the phone ordering more.
[01:23:46.256 --> 01:23:47.237]  I love your product.
[01:23:47.237 --> 01:23:47.677]  Thank you.
[01:23:47.677 --> 01:23:49.659]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:23:49.659 --> 01:23:52.821]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:52.821 --> 01:23:54.862]  Or visit oneworldway.com.
[01:23:54.862 --> 01:24:00.145]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[01:24:00.145 --> 01:24:02.927]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:24:02.927 --> 01:24:06.730]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:11.527 --> 01:24:12.948]  All right, Bill Ayers is our guest.
[01:24:12.948 --> 01:24:18.594]  This is a short six-minute segment, a long 18-minute segment's coming up so we can really get into a serious discussion.
[01:24:18.594 --> 01:24:23.719]  If he's up for it, we'll open the phones up so I guess supporters and detractors can call in.
[01:24:23.719 --> 01:24:26.422]  Here's where I stand, Professor Ayers.
[01:24:26.422 --> 01:24:30.726]  I don't know if you've read None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen.
[01:24:30.726 --> 01:24:33.129]  I read that book back when I was like 14 years old.
[01:24:33.829 --> 01:24:51.319]  Since then, pretty much all of it has been proven to be accurate, from my perspective, where ultra-rich crony capitalists fund socialist and communist movements, but also fascist movements, because they like to deal with command and control systems with domesticated populations.
[01:24:51.319 --> 01:24:57.583]  And I think that history has shown that collectivism delivers hell on earth and forced work camps.
[01:24:58.303 --> 01:25:07.772]  Now that's why I disagree with you fundamentally and I guess you believe that we have a real form of capitalism and you disagree with that.
[01:25:07.772 --> 01:25:10.815]  I don't believe we have capitalism.
[01:25:10.815 --> 01:25:18.221]  I believe we have fascism sitting on top of a socialist management system and that the left-right paradigm that's taught is a fraud.
[01:25:18.221 --> 01:25:18.682]  What do you say?
[01:25:19.813 --> 01:25:24.096]  I have no idea what you're talking about, but I think that I agree with you.
[01:25:24.096 --> 01:25:25.618]  I'm against forced work camps.
[01:25:25.618 --> 01:25:26.839]  I'm against slavery.
[01:25:26.839 --> 01:25:28.980]  I'm against nuclear holocaust.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:30.742]  I'm against military bases abroad.
[01:25:30.742 --> 01:25:32.203]  That I understand.
[01:25:32.203 --> 01:25:33.964]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:25:33.964 --> 01:25:42.371]  I know finance capitalism is one of the great dangers in the world today, but I don't know what you mean about them funding socialists.
[01:25:42.371 --> 01:25:43.932]  What socialists have they funded?
[01:25:44.392 --> 01:25:50.040]  And if you say, well they funded Barack Obama, I see no evidence that Barack Obama is a socialist in any sense at all.
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:54.085]  It's been declassified that the CIA did indeed put Mao Zedong into power in 1949.
[01:25:56.348 --> 01:25:57.249]  Where did you find that?
[01:25:57.249 --> 01:25:58.269]  That's fascinating.
[01:25:58.269 --> 01:26:01.372]  History Channel, but it was previously declassified.
[01:26:01.372 --> 01:26:03.693]  Yeah, I've never heard of that, but that's fascinating.
[01:26:03.693 --> 01:26:04.234]  Again, Mount St.
[01:26:04.234 --> 01:26:06.996]  Thomas is no hero of mine, so there we are.
[01:26:06.996 --> 01:26:15.282]  I mean, you've got these great theories, but I don't know, we're not talking the same language, because I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:26:15.282 --> 01:26:16.523]  Well, exactly.
[01:26:16.523 --> 01:26:24.330]  You're speaking academia speech where you're this nice, mild-mannered guy, and you're there with your significant other, Bernadine Dorn.
[01:26:24.330 --> 01:26:27.413]  I guess you guys were never involved in any bombings or anything, right?
[01:26:27.413 --> 01:26:28.293]  No, that's not true.
[01:26:28.293 --> 01:26:35.119]  We were involved in trying to stop the murder of 6,000 people a week by our government that dragged on for 10 years.
[01:26:35.119 --> 01:26:39.123]  We conducted, we, I was involved in nonviolent sit-ins, I was involved in
[01:26:39.343 --> 01:26:42.304]  You didn't bomb police officers or blind police officers?
[01:26:58.058 --> 01:26:58.838]  Not at all.
[01:26:58.838 --> 01:27:00.619]  Nothing like that ever happened.
[01:27:00.619 --> 01:27:03.400]  I know it's part of the narrative of the right, but it's just not true.
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:03.820]  Really?
[01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:07.361]  So Weatherman bombs never wounded police?
[01:27:07.361 --> 01:27:08.241]  I'm sorry?
[01:27:08.241 --> 01:27:10.922]  Weatherman bombs never wounded police?
[01:27:10.922 --> 01:27:11.922]  Never.
[01:27:11.922 --> 01:27:13.483]  Because you know what I'm going to do with all this.
[01:27:13.483 --> 01:27:19.105]  We're going to take this live interview and then take clips of what you're saying and then show them throughout.
[01:27:19.105 --> 01:27:19.765]  That's the whole point.
[01:27:20.761 --> 01:27:23.985]  I don't know what you're talking about because we were involved.
[01:27:23.985 --> 01:27:26.168]  I was underground for 11 years.
[01:27:26.168 --> 01:27:30.593]  The Weather Underground was very active between 1970 and 75.
[01:27:30.593 --> 01:27:38.543]  Our government, people like John McCain, killed 6,000 people a week for 10 years and we engaged in illegal, some would say
[01:27:39.043 --> 01:27:43.646]  You know, ill-advised, crossing lines of legality and maybe common sense.
[01:27:43.646 --> 01:27:52.491]  We're involved in extreme acts of vandalism to destroy property, to raise a screaming alarm against the courts.
[01:27:52.491 --> 01:27:57.314]  They claim that Tim McVeigh was angry about Waco and blew up that building.
[01:27:57.314 --> 01:28:04.159]  The evidence shows it's a false flag to blame the right, but expanding on that... I don't know what you're talking about about Waco.
[01:28:04.159 --> 01:28:07.641]  I'm not sure what you're... I'm asking you, do you think it was okay what McVeigh did?
[01:28:09.022 --> 01:28:10.342]  Absolutely not.
[01:28:10.342 --> 01:28:13.263]  He murdered people, innocent people, in the federal building.
[01:28:13.263 --> 01:28:14.344]  Absolutely not.
[01:28:14.344 --> 01:28:17.065]  We never did that, and we never murdered anybody.
[01:28:17.065 --> 01:28:20.086]  So, that's what McVeigh did was horrendous.
[01:28:20.086 --> 01:28:23.007]  Was Larry Grathwald... I heard he tried to debate you.
[01:28:23.007 --> 01:28:24.387]  Have you ever debated him?
[01:28:24.387 --> 01:28:25.688]  No, never.
[01:28:25.688 --> 01:28:30.629]  And he's passed away now, but Larry Grathwald was a pathological liar, a paid informant of the FBI.
[01:28:30.629 --> 01:28:38.372]  I don't know if you're a fan of the FBI, but Larry Grathwald was paid to lie, and none of what he said was true, or has ever been proven to be true.
[01:28:38.772 --> 01:28:49.022]  Well, I'm not a fan of a lot of stuff the FBI has done, but it's pretty much a creature of whatever, whoever runs the Justice Department and the White House, but I'm certainly not a fan of communists.
[01:28:49.022 --> 01:28:54.246]  So Larry Gradwell is a creature of the Justice Department, correct?
[01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:59.331]  Of the Justice Department he was under, but he... I think there's good people and bad people in there is what I'm saying.
[01:28:59.331 --> 01:29:02.214]  Do you like the Justice Department or do you not like that Justice Department?
[01:29:03.783 --> 01:29:11.869]  I believe that when you guys recruited him and reportedly tried to get him to train you in military tactics, I mean, I think it was good to stop violence.
[01:29:11.869 --> 01:29:13.170]  None of that is true.
[01:29:13.170 --> 01:29:15.311]  Larry Grathwald hung around SPS.
[01:29:15.311 --> 01:29:17.132]  Everybody thought he was a cop.
[01:29:17.132 --> 01:29:18.513]  It turns out he wasn't a cop.
[01:29:18.513 --> 01:29:23.016]  He was simply a paid informant, paid to lie, and that's what he did.
[01:29:23.016 --> 01:29:25.878]  None of what he said ever resulted in anything.
[01:29:25.878 --> 01:29:29.501]  So, the fact that he tried to make a second career out of himself,
[01:29:30.081 --> 01:29:31.042]  It's ludicrous.
[01:29:31.042 --> 01:29:32.562]  He was not a truthful person.
[01:29:32.562 --> 01:29:37.484]  He never told the truth and he never stood for anything except let me get a little money to lie to the judge.
[01:29:37.484 --> 01:29:38.485]  We gotta go to break.
[01:29:38.485 --> 01:29:38.865]  Come back.
[01:29:38.865 --> 01:29:42.667]  You can finish responding to that and give us your view on education, Common Core and more.
[01:29:42.667 --> 01:29:44.147]  BillAyers.org.
[01:29:44.147 --> 01:29:48.529]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:48.529 --> 01:29:49.910]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:51.510]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:55.152]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.286 --> 01:30:06.488]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.
[01:30:06.488 --> 01:30:16.110]  At InfoWars Life, our mission is to bring you the highest quality, purest, cleanest, effective colloidal silver on the market today for the lowest price available.
[01:30:16.110 --> 01:30:24.132]  You don't have to be a doctor to know the fall and winter months are the most dangerous time of year in North America when it comes to you and your family's health.
[01:30:24.392 --> 01:30:34.042]  Infowarslife.com is very excited to announce our biggest run yet of silver bullet colloidal silver exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.

[01:30:53.922 --> 01:30:54.263]  Silver Bullet.
[01:30:59.062 --> 01:31:06.228]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:31:06.228 --> 01:31:08.570]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:31:08.570 --> 01:31:13.855]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:31:13.855 --> 01:31:18.779]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:31:18.999 --> 01:31:22.321]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:31:22.321 --> 01:31:26.403]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:31:26.403 --> 01:31:30.725]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:31:30.725 --> 01:31:40.951]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:31:40.951 --> 01:31:43.472]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:31:43.672 --> 01:31:51.883]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:31:51.883 --> 01:31:55.848]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:31:59.568 --> 01:32:03.610]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super male.
[01:32:03.610 --> 01:32:05.591]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[01:32:05.591 --> 01:32:08.553]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.
[01:32:08.553 --> 01:32:11.054]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:11.054 --> 01:32:12.575]  You've heard the callers to the show.

[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:28.703]  Whether it's Survival Shield, Nascent Iodine, or DNA Force, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality,

[01:32:32.424 --> 01:32:40.546]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:40.546 --> 01:32:46.147]  Yes, it's just amazing what it's able to do to actually detox the body.

[01:33:14.104 --> 01:33:18.790]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:21.954]  Alright, I thought Bill Ayers was with us until the end of the hour.
[01:33:21.954 --> 01:33:23.576]  He's got to go at 50 after now.
[01:33:23.576 --> 01:33:24.757]  Or maybe he always did.
[01:33:25.956 --> 01:33:29.298]  We'll have time to take a few phone calls at 800-259-9231.
[01:33:29.298 --> 01:33:33.481]  I'd like to hear from some Bill Air supporters.
[01:33:33.481 --> 01:33:36.803]  We don't screen your calls, just your name and where you're calling from and how you're listening.
[01:33:36.803 --> 01:33:38.865]  If you support this guy, I'd love to hear from you.
[01:33:38.865 --> 01:33:42.127]  Or if you've got a serious question and don't support him, it's wide open, 800-259-9231.
[01:33:42.127 --> 01:33:42.207]  Look.
[01:33:46.195 --> 01:33:49.396]  I don't want to waste our time here with a he said, she said.
[01:33:49.396 --> 01:33:54.937]  I go to your website, billayers.org, and there's a red star on a black background up there.
[01:33:54.937 --> 01:33:57.258]  Looks pretty Maoist to me.
[01:33:57.258 --> 01:33:58.979]  You say you didn't like Mao.
[01:33:58.979 --> 01:34:07.001]  Was Larry Grathwald wrong that you guys followed a Maoist, Cultural Revolution-style system at the Weathermen?
[01:34:07.714 --> 01:34:09.636]  Yeah, he was wrong and he was lying.
[01:34:09.636 --> 01:34:15.623]  But the red star and the black background is also the sign for Heineken beer and Macy's.
[01:34:15.623 --> 01:34:17.325]  So be careful what you worry about.
[01:34:17.325 --> 01:34:19.207]  Oh, come on, man!
[01:34:19.207 --> 01:34:20.969]  You're a famous commie!
[01:34:20.969 --> 01:34:22.570]  Just admit it, you love linen!
[01:34:23.231 --> 01:34:24.732]  First of all, I'm not famous.
[01:34:24.732 --> 01:34:29.074]  Secondly, I don't know what you meant when you said Bill Air's supporters call in.
[01:34:29.074 --> 01:34:31.976]  We haven't had one substantive exchange, you and me.
[01:34:31.976 --> 01:34:35.078]  So I don't know what one would think to be a supporter.
[01:34:35.078 --> 01:34:38.560]  You mean if somebody has read one of my books and has something to say about it?
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:40.281]  We haven't talked about anything substantive.
[01:34:40.281 --> 01:34:45.944]  Okay, well you're setting and defining things, like MSNBC saying parents, your kids don't belong to you.
[01:34:45.944 --> 01:34:47.165]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:34:47.165 --> 01:34:48.686]  Do you support abortion?
[01:34:48.686 --> 01:34:50.247]  Wait, when did I say that?
[01:34:51.067 --> 01:34:53.289]  When did I say parents don't belong to their kids?
[01:34:53.289 --> 01:34:55.352]  I said MSNBC said that.
[01:34:55.352 --> 01:34:57.073]  No they did not.
[01:34:57.073 --> 01:34:58.274]  What are you talking about?
[01:34:58.274 --> 01:35:03.380]  They said we need to break through this view that kids belong to their parents and that they actually belong to the wider community.
[01:35:05.262 --> 01:35:08.024]  You know, I'm so bewildered about what you're talking about.
[01:35:08.024 --> 01:35:11.805]  Let's talk about the question of whether kids belong to their parents.
[01:35:11.805 --> 01:35:14.726]  If a kid is being, let's talk about that.
[01:35:14.726 --> 01:35:22.190]  In general, I think yes, indeed, children and their parents and their families are sacred, sacrosanct, absolutely.
[01:35:22.190 --> 01:35:26.531]  But if a parent is raping the child, the community has an interest in stopping that.
[01:35:26.531 --> 01:35:27.612]  Do you agree with that?
[01:35:27.612 --> 01:35:29.913]  Yes, so you agree with Melissa Harris Perry?
[01:35:31.055 --> 01:35:32.056]  I'm not sure.
[01:35:32.056 --> 01:35:33.357]  Wait a minute.
[01:35:33.357 --> 01:35:33.717]  About what?
[01:36:01.996 --> 01:36:11.645]  What do you think about Obama wanting a domestic security force just as big and just as strong as our military and having youth brigades chanting his name?
[01:36:14.468 --> 01:36:19.009]  I didn't know he was doing that, but I'm opposed to all domestic security forces.
[01:36:19.009 --> 01:36:20.910]  I'm opposed to the U.S.
[01:36:20.910 --> 01:36:21.390]  military.
[01:36:21.390 --> 01:36:30.091]  I'm opposed to the massive militaristic nature of the society, including surveillance, mass incarceration, militarization of the police.
[01:36:30.091 --> 01:36:31.232]  All of that I'm opposed to.
[01:36:31.232 --> 01:36:42.174]  What do you think, Bill Ayers, of our government with NATO, or maybe you disagree, arming al-Qaeda, renaming them ISIS, to turn a militia on Syria and murder hundreds of thousands?
[01:36:43.257 --> 01:36:46.199]  You know, I've always been opposed to the U.S.
[01:36:46.199 --> 01:36:49.082]  arming Al-Qaeda, which they did in their fight against the Soviet Union.
[01:36:49.082 --> 01:36:52.705]  The Al-Qaeda is a creation of the United States.
[01:36:52.705 --> 01:36:53.045]  Yes.
[01:36:53.045 --> 01:37:03.974]  And now they've created ISIS, and all these invasions, including the Bush-Cheney invasion of Iraq, have been mindless and stupid, and they've caused nothing but grief in the world and in the United States.
[01:37:05.219 --> 01:37:10.963]  Well I'll say this, we have a big video out today that's going viral where we expose American Sniper as a giant hoax.
[01:37:10.963 --> 01:37:15.025]  So just so you know where I'm coming from, I attack everything I see as baloney.
[01:37:15.025 --> 01:37:18.047]  So I agree, there's right wing tyranny, there's left wing tyranny.
[01:37:18.047 --> 01:37:20.849]  I attack everything I see as baloney as well.
[01:37:21.449 --> 01:37:23.931]  And right now I'm feeling you're the biggest baloney here.
[01:37:23.931 --> 01:37:25.092]  I don't understand.
[01:37:25.092 --> 01:37:26.773]  Do I support Melissa Harris Perry?
[01:37:26.773 --> 01:37:28.134]  What is that?
[01:37:28.134 --> 01:37:29.375]  I didn't even know what you're talking about.
[01:37:29.375 --> 01:37:32.197]  Well that's like the mouth of Sauron MSNBC.
[01:37:32.197 --> 01:37:36.881]  You're like a real celebrity over there and so that's the kind of stuff they're saying.
[01:37:36.881 --> 01:37:38.122]  You're absolutely mistaken.
[01:37:38.122 --> 01:37:40.904]  I am not a celebrity anywhere but certainly not on MSNBC.
[01:37:40.904 --> 01:37:41.805]  That is pure bold.
[01:37:41.805 --> 01:37:46.188]  You are almost like a Christ-like figure in the circles of hardcore commies.
[01:37:47.049 --> 01:37:49.731]  Show me some evidence of that, Alex.
[01:37:49.731 --> 01:37:50.672]  That's so fascinating.
[01:37:50.672 --> 01:37:54.756]  I feel like I'm just sitting here in my home trying to write something this morning.
[01:37:54.756 --> 01:37:58.979]  I'm suddenly having a conversation with you and you're bringing up these gigantic categoricals.
[01:37:58.979 --> 01:38:00.321]  I have no idea what you're referring to.
[01:38:00.321 --> 01:38:03.544]  Sure, let me just play Melissa Harris Perry for you in a promo.
[01:38:03.544 --> 01:38:04.164]  They still air.
[01:38:04.164 --> 01:38:06.466]  They've been airing this for three years.
[01:38:06.466 --> 01:38:06.787]  Here it is.
[01:38:07.587 --> 01:38:16.011]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:38:16.011 --> 01:38:21.313]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making better investments.
[01:38:21.313 --> 01:38:27.316]  So do you agree with that or disagree with the lean forward Marxist-Leninist statement?
[01:38:27.316 --> 01:38:29.717]  I only got a little piece of that because I was talking, but
[01:38:30.537 --> 01:38:34.199]  I'll once again give you the example, and you tell me if you agree.
[01:38:34.199 --> 01:38:35.100]  No, no, we've already been over that.
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:36.941]  Let me ask you this key question.
[01:38:36.941 --> 01:38:53.030]  Are you aware that IBM and the eugenicist movement funded much of the modern left, and Margaret Sanger, who got awards from Hitler, gave awards from Hitler, that the whole Great Society was a plan to take over black communities and exterminate them because they're, quote, weeds?
[01:38:54.284 --> 01:39:11.129]  Well, I know that the eugenicist movement, and Margaret Sanger, and Hitler, and a large part of the American society were eugenicists, and academics were eugenicists, and I think it's all part of a very heinous part of the human history and the human condition.
[01:39:11.129 --> 01:39:19.632]  Well, I agree with you, and from our research, the left represents the core vestigial movement, and at its base it's eugenical.
[01:39:19.632 --> 01:39:22.273]  Maybe you never got that high in the power structure, but that's what it is.
[01:39:22.993 --> 01:39:24.374]  I had no idea.
[01:39:24.374 --> 01:39:25.935]  But this is news to me.
[01:39:25.935 --> 01:39:27.617]  I have no idea what you're referring to.
[01:39:27.617 --> 01:39:44.369]  I don't know that the left... I mean, to me, the Hitler and the right-wing notion of racial superiority and white supremacy has never been a core value of the left.
[01:39:44.369 --> 01:39:46.451]  So again, I don't accept your premise.
[01:39:46.451 --> 01:39:47.492]  I don't know who you're referring to.
[01:39:49.304 --> 01:39:59.649]  The reason some of what I say to you you know about makes sense and other stuff you say sounds a total baloney is because I am outside the box and I'm trying to transcend all these labels.
[01:39:59.649 --> 01:40:07.113]  Hitler called himself a National Socialist, but I would agree with you that he had right-wing aspects, but only within the left-right paradigm.
[01:40:07.113 --> 01:40:09.774]  As Carl Quigley wrote, have you read Tragedy and Hope by Carl Quigley?
[01:40:10.484 --> 01:40:10.985]  No, I have none.
[01:40:10.985 --> 01:40:12.306]  I have no idea.
[01:40:33.564 --> 01:40:38.086]  I don't know much about Bill Clinton, but I've never been a supporter of Bill Clinton.
[01:40:38.086 --> 01:40:42.648]  And so, again, you're trying to make some connection that I'm not following.
[01:40:42.648 --> 01:40:43.949]  I haven't read the book.
[01:40:43.949 --> 01:40:45.730]  I don't know he was Clinton's advisor.
[01:40:45.730 --> 01:40:47.611]  I've never been an admirer of Bill Clinton.
[01:40:47.611 --> 01:40:48.491]  Sure.
[01:40:48.491 --> 01:40:57.035]  I'm trying to get at the fact that there are robber barons funding socialist and communist movements from Armand Hammer to people like
[01:40:57.675 --> 01:41:02.979]  Uh, George Soros, who just got caught spending 33 million trying to hype up the Ferguson protest.
[01:41:02.979 --> 01:41:04.300]  Are you aware of that?
[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:05.200]  I am not.
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:05.941]  I am not.
[01:41:05.941 --> 01:41:16.968]  And George Soros, again, I know nothing about George Soros, but the idea that somehow big capitalists are funding movements that would want to overthrow them seems preposterous to me.
[01:41:16.968 --> 01:41:22.492]  But again, you're crashing through the lies, so maybe you know something I don't know, but I don't know it.
[01:41:22.492 --> 01:41:26.514]  So asking me about it as if I'm an expert on it, I have no idea what you're referring to.
[01:41:26.514 --> 01:41:27.155]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:41:27.955 --> 01:41:35.739]  The system promotes communism or socialism as the only way to rebel against corrupt forms of capitalism, and I just think that's a total fraud, and I'm sick of it.
[01:41:35.739 --> 01:41:36.659]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:41:36.659 --> 01:41:49.865]  I don't think that's true, and I think that most systems, and certainly the American government, hates dissent, despises dissent, and does everything it can do to ruin it, to wreck it, to reframe it.
[01:41:49.865 --> 01:41:56.328]  And so no, I don't accept the terms that are given to me by the ruling class or by the 1%.
[01:41:56.328 --> 01:41:56.988]  I don't accept it.
[01:41:57.148 --> 01:42:10.356]  Sure, well I found that communism is historically least tolerant of free speech than capitalism, though I agree capitalism is degenerating into a fascist, corporatist model right now.
[01:42:11.161 --> 01:42:12.562]  I think that's probably true.
[01:42:12.562 --> 01:42:27.752]  There are all kinds of indications of fascism, including the intolerance of dissent and including the suppression of free speech and including the linkage of corporations with government, which has gone so far that we have very little left of a participatory
[01:42:28.172 --> 01:42:28.412]  Thank you.
[01:42:45.239 --> 01:42:58.505]  But if you notice, the one-tenth of one percent that control most of the wealth in the world get their money from government deals, insider deals, government bailouts, and they're the ones pushing higher taxes on the middle class, Warren Buffett and other dirtbags.
[01:42:58.505 --> 01:43:04.328]  Don't you know they're funding leftist foundations across the board and want a limited leftist movement to domesticate the public?
[01:43:04.728 --> 01:43:15.695]  Sir, I don't consider these foundations leftist foundations, but I do think that the Ford Foundation, the Gates Foundation, the Broad Foundation, all of these people are right wing.
[01:43:15.695 --> 01:43:16.275]  Absolutely.
[01:43:16.275 --> 01:43:17.816]  So I agree with you on that.
[01:43:17.816 --> 01:43:21.238]  And I think that government, this is a government that supports
[01:43:21.718 --> 01:43:24.039]  The big finance capitalist class.
[01:43:24.039 --> 01:43:27.980]  There's no question in my mind that the government is run by Wall Street.
[01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:28.701]  That's who runs it.
[01:43:28.701 --> 01:43:34.883]  But I'm saying they're creating a monopoly so you can't call it capitalist and I'm not saying the foundations are right-wing or left-wing.
[01:43:34.883 --> 01:43:38.844]  They push fake left-wing ideology as a form of domestication.
[01:43:38.844 --> 01:43:41.085]  I don't see any fake left-wing ideology.
[01:43:41.085 --> 01:43:42.385]  You take the Ford Foundation.
[01:43:42.385 --> 01:43:48.808]  The Ford Foundation, you know, funds mostly horrible, controlling, racist kinds of things.
[01:43:49.748 --> 01:43:50.569]  I don't have anything to say.
[01:43:50.569 --> 01:43:52.209]  The Ford Foundation wants the open borders.
[01:43:52.209 --> 01:43:58.813]  What do you think of Obama acting unilaterally more and more, not even executive orders, but just doing whatever he wants?
[01:43:58.813 --> 01:44:00.954]  I don't know what, again, what are you referring to?
[01:44:00.954 --> 01:44:03.475]  For example... Open borders!
[01:44:03.475 --> 01:44:04.716]  The power plants.
[01:44:04.716 --> 01:44:07.677]  I don't think he's done anything about open borders.
[01:44:07.677 --> 01:44:13.600]  I think the idea, for example, of opening to Cuba, which he did unilaterally, was a good thing.
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:15.101]  I think it should have happened
[01:44:15.981 --> 01:44:30.573]  50 years ago, I think the idea that somehow the United States has gained anything by trying to destroy Cuba also has hurt the Cuban people and isolated them from the possibility of new ideas and new developments.
[01:44:30.573 --> 01:44:36.978]  I think it's great that the United States now has an open door to Cuba and Marco Rubio can have a
[01:44:37.618 --> 01:44:37.738]  Sure.
[01:44:37.738 --> 01:44:37.938]  Sure.
[01:44:37.938 --> 01:44:38.639]  Let me do this.
[01:44:38.639 --> 01:44:40.960]  I want to go to some phone calls while we've got you.
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:41.380]  BillAyers.org.
[01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:43.041]  You can find his books and other things there.
[01:45:04.673 --> 01:45:09.978]  I think there's a culture clash here because we're not in the controlled left or controlled right paradigm.
[01:45:09.978 --> 01:45:15.622]  I mean, I am a feminist in that I want women to all be trained how to use firearms.
[01:45:15.622 --> 01:45:16.423]  That's right.
[01:45:16.423 --> 01:45:20.085]  Let me guess, you don't want the citizens to have weapons, right?
[01:45:20.085 --> 01:45:26.851]  No, that's not true, but I'm a feminist in the sense that I think women should be paid equally for equal work and have the right to control their bodies.
[01:45:26.851 --> 01:45:28.172]  Sure, should women be able to own guns?
[01:45:29.198 --> 01:45:30.438]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:45:30.438 --> 01:45:30.778]  Oh, good.
[01:45:30.778 --> 01:45:33.699]  So you're not for taking the guns, like Chicago's done?
[01:45:33.699 --> 01:45:34.459]  Never have been.
[01:45:34.459 --> 01:45:36.079]  I don't know what you're referring to.
[01:45:36.079 --> 01:45:37.960]  So, you're an old-fashioned-type commie.
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:42.141]  You believe in Raising the Line, AK-47.
[01:45:42.141 --> 01:45:45.081]  Either we should go one of two directions.
[01:45:45.081 --> 01:45:53.403]  We should either disarm everybody, starting with the most massive military establishment ever established on Earth, and that's the U.S.
[01:45:53.403 --> 01:45:53.823]  military.
[01:45:53.823 --> 01:45:56.864]  We can disarm them, disarm the police, disarm everybody, or
[01:45:57.304 --> 01:46:00.008]  We should go the other direction and arm the homeless.
[01:46:00.008 --> 01:46:01.671]  Which is, I think, would be a great thing.
[01:46:01.671 --> 01:46:03.995]  I think there are a lot of good people among the homeless.
[01:46:03.995 --> 01:46:06.399]  Why not have them all get a little... I think there's a lot.
[01:46:06.399 --> 01:46:11.567]  I think you actually, you find mainly, and I'm sad for homeless, I try to help them, but most of them are schizophrenic drug addicts.
[01:46:13.177 --> 01:46:14.858]  Good Lord!
[01:46:14.858 --> 01:46:17.300]  Ted, why aren't they getting help?
[01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:28.907]  I bet you $10,000 you can come to Austin with me, and if 90% of the homeless aren't mentally ill people dumped out of facilities, who I feel sorry for, or aren't total drug addicts, I'll give you $10,000.
[01:46:28.907 --> 01:46:31.389]  I mean, everybody knows they're mainly mentally ill.
[01:46:31.869 --> 01:46:34.671]  Would we count on you to be the diagnostician?
[01:46:34.671 --> 01:46:36.612]  I'd be a little suspicious.
[01:46:36.612 --> 01:46:38.833]  No, we can bring, like, three random people with us.
[01:46:38.833 --> 01:46:44.537]  I mean, if the person's muttering to themselves and talking to themselves, I mean, obviously they're completely out of their minds.
[01:46:44.537 --> 01:46:47.078]  I mean, you know most of the homeless people.
[01:46:47.078 --> 01:46:52.622]  Listen, you've been muttering to yourself for the last 45 minutes, but... Good one!
[01:46:52.622 --> 01:46:56.604]  But listen, Alex... Should I be locked up like the Soviets would do?
[01:46:56.604 --> 01:46:57.745]  Am I mentally ill?
[01:46:58.525 --> 01:47:04.307]  If they are mentally ill on the streets of Austin, shouldn't they get some help from the community?
[01:47:04.307 --> 01:47:07.688]  Shouldn't we allow them to get treatment?
[01:47:07.688 --> 01:47:08.248]  Absolutely.
[01:47:08.248 --> 01:47:08.928]  I'm all for that.
[01:47:08.928 --> 01:47:11.969]  But you notice the welfare system always gets sucked up by the corporations.
[01:47:11.969 --> 01:47:14.050]  I want to go to some phone calls while we've got you here.
[01:47:14.050 --> 01:47:15.130]  We don't have you very long.
[01:47:15.130 --> 01:47:16.030]  Maybe five, six more minutes.
[01:47:16.030 --> 01:47:18.031]  We appreciate Bill Ayers joining us.
[01:47:18.031 --> 01:47:23.532]  I gotta say, I agree with more of what Bill Ayers says than what Obama says, which is frightening.
[01:47:23.532 --> 01:47:25.433]  Bill Ayers says arm the women!
[01:47:26.579 --> 01:47:27.480]  Absolutely.
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:28.080]  Arm them!
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:30.222]  Yeah!
[01:47:30.222 --> 01:47:32.484]  Don't forget, arm the homeless.
[01:47:32.484 --> 01:47:33.845]  Arm everybody!
[01:47:33.845 --> 01:47:34.306]  That's right.
[01:47:34.306 --> 01:47:35.767]  I say arm the police.
[01:47:35.767 --> 01:47:37.028]  Everybody can have weapons.
[01:47:37.028 --> 01:47:39.891]  If they have tanks, I have tanks.
[01:47:39.891 --> 01:47:41.852]  I gotta have my guns when the commies come.
[01:47:41.852 --> 01:47:43.354]  Let's talk to Gary.
[01:47:43.354 --> 01:47:45.235]  Gary in Pennsylvania, you're up first.
[01:47:45.235 --> 01:47:45.556]  Go ahead.
[01:47:47.274 --> 01:47:48.034]  Yes, hi Bill.
[01:47:48.034 --> 01:47:59.118]  I just wanted to ask you a quick question, maybe get a few bullet points on what your definition in your own work and opinion of the difference between socialism and communism, just of what you believe in.
[01:47:59.118 --> 01:48:08.781]  Well, you know, I don't think, you know, for me, if you read, if you read, for example, the Communist Manifesto, there's a lot in there that you would find you agree with.
[01:48:08.781 --> 01:48:12.522]  The Communist Manifesto is not a plan for state communism.
[01:48:12.522 --> 01:48:14.383]  It's not a plan to overthrow the government.
[01:48:14.383 --> 01:48:14.683]  It's not a
[01:48:15.143 --> 01:48:31.552]  Playbook for communist revolution what it is is mainly a praise song for capitalism it basically says in the historical sweep of nations the the the rise of capitalism is the most productive force that's ever been made and It's going to exhaust itself.
[01:48:31.552 --> 01:48:39.256]  I think that the communism of the 20th century was catastrophic for humanity I think the socialism of the 21st century 20th century and 21st century in Europe is
[01:48:52.224 --> 01:48:57.428]  Socialism is a stagnant, rotten cesspit that lets special interests control big pools of money.
[01:48:57.428 --> 01:49:00.790]  That's why big money always is backing limited socialism.
[01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:06.894]  And I'm glad you just basically admitted that it's all nothing but a corporate welfare system that controls the population.
[01:49:06.894 --> 01:49:07.455]  Gary, thank you.
[01:49:08.477 --> 01:49:12.598]  In Europe, yes Alex, that's what I said.
[01:49:12.598 --> 01:49:13.998]  I don't think you should be surprised.
[01:49:13.998 --> 01:49:18.139]  If you've ever read anything I've written, I write about these kinds of things all the time.
[01:49:18.139 --> 01:49:19.140]  Folks can read your website.
[01:49:19.140 --> 01:49:21.440]  Let's rush us some more calls here.
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:23.401]  Let's go ahead and go to Ray in Iowa.
[01:49:23.401 --> 01:49:26.221]  Go ahead, you're on the air with the Grand Weatherman.
[01:49:26.221 --> 01:49:27.842]  Go ahead.
[01:49:27.842 --> 01:49:29.462]  Yes sir, Alex.
[01:49:29.462 --> 01:49:31.263]  Thank you sir for taking my call.
[01:49:31.263 --> 01:49:32.823]  Go ahead, you're on the air with the Grand Boobob.
[01:49:33.499 --> 01:49:36.121]  Well, I had a question for Mr. Bill Ayers.
[01:49:36.121 --> 01:49:44.446]  I wanted to find out if he had ever seen a film by Joel Gilbert called Dreams of My Real Father.
[01:49:44.446 --> 01:49:50.430]  And if so, what was his take on that film and how did he feel about it?
[01:49:50.430 --> 01:49:52.651]  I've not seen it and I've never heard of it.
[01:49:52.651 --> 01:49:53.792]  Frank Marshall Davis.
[01:49:53.792 --> 01:49:55.433]  Did you know him?
[01:49:55.433 --> 01:49:56.934]  I never knew Frank Marshall Davis.
[01:49:56.934 --> 01:50:00.436]  I read about him in the New York Times.
[01:50:00.436 --> 01:50:02.137]  So Barack never told you that was his pappy?
[01:50:03.197 --> 01:50:07.239]  I, you know, I knew Barack Obama about as well as thousands and thousands of other people.
[01:50:07.239 --> 01:50:09.579]  It's not that we, we weren't intimate friends.
[01:50:09.579 --> 01:50:11.940]  We never shared a milkshake with two straws.
[01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:12.200]  Never.
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:16.322]  Alright, well, nobody ever said you did that.
[01:50:16.322 --> 01:50:18.063]  You'd have to be cuddling to be doing that.
[01:50:18.063 --> 01:50:19.183]  We were close friends.
[01:50:19.183 --> 01:50:19.643]  I was not intimate.
[01:50:19.643 --> 01:50:21.784]  You never dated Barack Obama?
[01:50:21.784 --> 01:50:23.184]  I never dated him, right.
[01:50:23.184 --> 01:50:26.206]  Okay.
[01:50:26.206 --> 01:50:27.806]  Let's go ahead and go to Jeff in Tennessee.
[01:50:27.806 --> 01:50:29.487]  You're on the air with Bill Ayers.
[01:50:29.487 --> 01:50:29.847]  Go ahead.
[01:50:29.847 --> 01:50:32.088]  We got two more calls and we'll let his lordship go.
[01:50:32.088 --> 01:50:32.368]  Go ahead.
[01:50:33.832 --> 01:50:35.332]  Okay, hey guys.
[01:50:35.332 --> 01:50:36.753]  Good to talk to you, Mr. Ayers.
[01:50:36.753 --> 01:50:40.334]  Just a question as far as listening to you talk on the radio.
[01:50:40.334 --> 01:50:45.255]  I mean, there's things that we definitely have in common, but there's a lot of things we don't have in common.
[01:50:45.255 --> 01:50:53.818]  And I think what helped me understand, if just hypothetically Rand Paul and Hillary Clinton are running for office, which one would you vote for?
[01:50:53.818 --> 01:50:57.559]  And what would be your reasonings behind standing behind one or the other?
[01:50:58.439 --> 01:51:05.104]  I wouldn't vote for either one of them, and I'm not a big fan of the Republicans and the Democrats.
[01:51:05.104 --> 01:51:12.829]  In fact, I don't think, if you look at history, I don't think that the great man or the great woman is what changes history.
[01:51:12.829 --> 01:51:20.314]  If you look at Lyndon Johnson, he was never part of the Black Freedom Movement, but he passed the most far-reaching civil rights legislation since Reconstruction.
[01:51:20.314 --> 01:51:26.158]  Franklin Roosevelt was never part of the labor movement, and Abraham Lincoln never belonged to an abolitionist party.
[01:51:26.158 --> 01:51:28.299]  What changes history is movements on the ground.
[01:51:29.019 --> 01:51:37.183]  I'm more interested in people being active in trying to engage with each other to change the terms of the discussion.
[01:51:37.183 --> 01:51:38.484]  The people are the resistance.
[01:51:38.484 --> 01:51:40.785]  We agree on that.
[01:51:40.785 --> 01:51:42.265]  Then who's president?
[01:51:42.265 --> 01:51:42.846]  Who's president?
[01:51:42.846 --> 01:51:49.328]  You notice, if you go back even in this century, Democrat, Republican, Democrat, Republican, they're pretty much the same.
[01:51:49.328 --> 01:51:51.689]  They're not completely the same, but they're pretty much the same.
[01:51:51.689 --> 01:51:53.850]  Well, who would you share a milkshake with?
[01:51:53.850 --> 01:51:56.892]  Hillary Clinton or Rand Paul?
[01:51:57.762 --> 01:52:01.303]  You know, I find Hillary Clinton, I could never vote for Hillary Clinton.
[01:52:01.303 --> 01:52:03.084]  She's in the pocket of Wall Street.
[01:52:03.084 --> 01:52:05.624]  She's a militaristic candidate.
[01:52:05.624 --> 01:52:08.445]  And those are the two things that matter most to me.
[01:52:08.445 --> 01:52:13.486]  Rand Paul, I agree with him more around the question of militarism.
[01:52:13.486 --> 01:52:16.147]  But he also is a Wall Street favorite.
[01:52:16.147 --> 01:52:19.308]  So, you know, neither one of them really.
[01:52:19.308 --> 01:52:21.729]  I'd like to share a milkshake with you in Austin.
[01:52:22.893 --> 01:52:27.937]  Alright, if you come down here, we will share a milkshake.
[01:52:27.937 --> 01:52:30.299]  A strawberry milkshake together.
[01:52:30.299 --> 01:52:32.481]  Let's go ahead and take two more calls and we'll let you go.
[01:52:32.481 --> 01:52:33.382]  I appreciate your time.
[01:52:33.382 --> 01:52:35.403]  This is a ridiculous debate, folks.
[01:52:35.403 --> 01:52:36.865]  We'll get him in person down here.
[01:52:36.865 --> 01:52:38.146]  We'll waterboard him.
[01:52:38.146 --> 01:52:39.487]  That's what patriots do.
[01:52:39.487 --> 01:52:40.407]  We'll get the answers.
[01:52:40.407 --> 01:52:41.048]  I'm joking.
[01:52:41.048 --> 01:52:42.449]  You guys waterboard people?
[01:52:42.449 --> 01:52:43.230]  What?
[01:52:43.230 --> 01:52:44.091]  It's a joke.
[01:52:44.091 --> 01:52:45.612]  I don't support waterboarding.
[01:52:45.612 --> 01:52:49.455]  Even though Dick Cheney... You know, I'm a big fan of Dick Cheney, though.
[01:52:49.455 --> 01:52:50.336]  I'm shocked.
[01:52:51.127 --> 01:52:51.928]  I'm joking.
[01:52:51.928 --> 01:52:57.912]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to... Let's go ahead and talk to Patrick and then Kevin and then that's it.
[01:52:57.912 --> 01:52:59.713]  I'll have to get to Clint and others because we've got to go.
[01:52:59.713 --> 01:53:00.333]  Our guest has got to go.
[01:53:00.333 --> 01:53:01.274]  We're holding him over.
[01:53:01.274 --> 01:53:03.976]  Patrick, you're on the air with Bill Ayers.
[01:53:03.976 --> 01:53:04.536]  Yes, hello.
[01:53:04.536 --> 01:53:06.217]  Mr. Ayers, I'm curious.
[01:53:06.217 --> 01:53:08.419]  There's a lot of this discussion going back and forth.
[01:53:08.419 --> 01:53:10.880]  I constantly hear the same thing coming out of your mouth.
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:11.861]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:53:11.861 --> 01:53:12.461]  I'm not familiar.
[01:53:12.461 --> 01:53:12.902]  I don't know.
[01:53:12.902 --> 01:53:13.282]  I don't know.
[01:53:15.347 --> 01:53:26.540]  My question is, what is it that you do know, and obviously it should be education, but I question that because you look at the current state of our educational system, it's absolutely just blasphemously ignorant and disgusting.
[01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:34.810]  Is that something that you advocate as being appropriate, or do you find there's a better model than what this public system is doing to demolish the brains of these young children?
[01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:40.743]  I very much have been a person who's opposed the status quo in education.
[01:53:40.743 --> 01:53:48.206]  Where I think we could start, in a lot of different places we could start, but one of the things is public education very much serves the people who are privileged.
[01:53:48.206 --> 01:53:53.349]  So you go to a city like Winnetka, north of Chicago, those kids get a great education.
[01:53:53.349 --> 01:53:56.330]  Go to Chicago, those kids get a rotten education.
[01:53:56.330 --> 01:53:56.970]  Why?
[01:53:56.970 --> 01:54:04.374]  Because the education for the people who are pulling the strings is an education for initiative, courage, imagination, and entrepreneurship.
[01:54:04.794 --> 01:54:08.657]  The education the kids in Chicago get is about obedience and conformity.
[01:54:08.657 --> 01:54:12.941]  Well, that's true, but shouldn't people in Chicago themselves change that?
[01:54:12.941 --> 01:54:20.146]  To say some small, wealthy town shouldn't use its own money for its kids is just fundamentally theft.
[01:54:20.146 --> 01:54:23.869]  Alex, you asked the question and the answer I'll give you is yes.
[01:54:23.869 --> 01:54:25.671]  Shouldn't the people in Chicago change it?
[01:54:25.671 --> 01:54:25.831]  Yes.
[01:54:27.125 --> 01:54:27.886]  There you go!
[01:54:27.886 --> 01:54:30.448]  So, I mean, I want people to do good.
[01:54:30.448 --> 01:54:35.933]  And I mean, certainly there's inequity, but there will always be in any attempt to change it by just taking money creates a new evil.
[01:54:35.933 --> 01:54:36.753]  Patrick?
[01:54:36.753 --> 01:54:39.576]  You know, again, I never said anything about taking money.
[01:54:39.576 --> 01:54:40.536]  Here's what I would say.
[01:54:40.536 --> 01:54:48.183]  In a democracy, whatever the most privileged and wisest parents have for their children should be the baseline of what we want for all children.
[01:54:48.183 --> 01:54:50.165]  But we're not a democracy, we're a republic.
[01:54:50.165 --> 01:54:52.547]  We can't have two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:54:54.102 --> 01:54:59.465]  Well, the fact is that we want all kids, I want all kids to get a decent education.
[01:54:59.465 --> 01:55:03.147]  And a decent education is not an education for obedience and control.
[01:55:03.147 --> 01:55:05.248]  Do you like Common Core?
[01:55:05.248 --> 01:55:06.608]  No, I do not like Common Core.
[01:55:06.608 --> 01:55:20.055]  And the hugest thing that's hideous about Common Core is it goes along with the corporate reform agenda of reducing education to a simple-minded score on a standardized test.
[01:55:20.055 --> 01:55:20.796]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:55:21.536 --> 01:55:23.077]  More testing, more testing.
[01:55:23.077 --> 01:55:25.540]  That is an anathema to education.
[01:55:25.540 --> 01:55:29.063]  Well, yeah, the left defends it all day, but you're actually right.
[01:55:29.063 --> 01:55:32.366]  Bill and Melinda Gates came up with it as a brainwashing system.
[01:55:32.366 --> 01:55:38.531]  It is a corporatist thing, and the right wing can't square that, that their precious corporations want a bunch of dumb zombies.
[01:55:38.531 --> 01:55:39.072]  Wait a minute.
[01:55:39.072 --> 01:55:42.315]  When you say the left supports it, who are you talking about?
[01:55:42.315 --> 01:55:46.238]  I think you've got some magical mindset somewhere.
[01:55:46.238 --> 01:55:47.079]  Am I the left?
[01:55:47.079 --> 01:55:47.800]  I don't support it.
[01:55:48.666 --> 01:55:50.768]  So who's the left that you're referring to that loves Common Sense?
[01:55:50.768 --> 01:55:56.012]  The mainline Democrats that can't tie their shoelaces and think that Martin Luther King is an astronaut.
[01:55:56.012 --> 01:56:01.677]  But I just said to you, I thought that leading Democrats are idiots and they're like leading Republicans.
[01:56:01.677 --> 01:56:06.161]  In fact, we have one political party in this country in charge, it's called the Repulsocrats.
[01:56:08.510 --> 01:56:10.571]  The Repulsor Crafts!
[01:56:10.571 --> 01:56:14.533]  Alright, well, I do appreciate you joining us.
[01:56:14.533 --> 01:56:19.856]  I'm late, but thank you for talking to me, and I hope to talk to you in Austin someday.
[01:56:19.856 --> 01:56:28.501]  If you come down to Austin, we'll host you in studio, and even though it's evil and capitalist, we'd pay for your hotel room and the strawberry milkshakes.
[01:56:28.501 --> 01:56:31.102]  I don't think there's any wrong with paying for the hotel room.
[01:56:31.102 --> 01:56:31.903]  We'll talk again.
[01:56:31.903 --> 01:56:35.224]  We'll put some vodka in the milkshake.
[01:56:35.224 --> 01:56:36.005]  I have no idea.
[01:56:37.650 --> 01:56:38.650]  Well, we'll get you drunk.
[01:56:38.650 --> 01:56:39.951]  The truth serum.
[01:56:39.951 --> 01:56:43.112]  What is that in Latin that wine makes you tell the truth?
[01:56:43.112 --> 01:56:43.932]  I have no idea.
[01:56:43.932 --> 01:56:46.453]  You want to have a drinking contest and sell tickets?
[01:56:46.453 --> 01:56:47.473]  No, I don't drink.
[01:56:47.473 --> 01:56:48.253]  But thanks anyway.
[01:56:48.253 --> 01:56:48.953]  Me neither.
[01:56:48.953 --> 01:56:50.014]  Vino Veritas.
[01:56:50.014 --> 01:56:51.074]  Have a good one.
[01:56:51.074 --> 01:56:53.275]  You too.
[01:56:53.275 --> 01:56:53.935]  Oh my goodness.
[01:56:55.670 --> 01:56:56.671]  Oh, boy.
[01:56:56.671 --> 01:57:00.455]  Well, that's the hardcore commie trying to charm us.
[01:57:00.455 --> 01:57:01.576]  And, oh, I don't know this.
[01:57:01.576 --> 01:57:02.957]  Oh, I don't know that.
[01:57:02.957 --> 01:57:05.400]  I'm sorry I didn't get to Kevin, Clint, Allen, and others.
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:07.362]  And I've really not even plugged anything.
[01:57:07.362 --> 01:57:09.103]  I've got something really exciting to announce.
[01:57:10.111 --> 01:57:17.155]  We have the super high quality nutraceutical grade DNA Force Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine, silver bullet colloidal silver.
[01:57:17.155 --> 01:57:18.636]  That's a low price for the value.
[01:57:18.636 --> 01:57:20.817]  It's about $10 less than leading competitor.
[01:57:20.817 --> 01:57:22.678]  It's the same silver you have at Whole Foods.
[01:57:22.678 --> 01:57:27.401]  Just we private label it from the same company and it's about $5 to $10 cheaper depending on what sale they have.
[01:57:28.482 --> 01:57:33.586]  But some of our stuff is higher end because it's so expensive to get some of these compounds.
[01:57:33.586 --> 01:57:51.038]  So I said, I want to come out with an entire line of discount, but high quality, organic, concentrated, but known ancient defense, that's my term, type things that are known staples that work, that are purified, that are strong at the lowest price anywhere.
[01:57:51.038 --> 01:57:56.242]  The leading competitor that's basically almost the same formula is $35.
[01:57:59.386 --> 01:58:05.308]  It's basically even, I'm gonna just be honest with folks, it's made at the same major respected factory.
[01:58:05.308 --> 01:58:06.748]  Laboratory.
[01:58:06.748 --> 01:58:08.589]  Our formula's a little bit different.
[01:58:08.589 --> 01:58:10.010]  Ours is $14.95.
[01:58:10.010 --> 01:58:13.051]  It's ancient defense, we did a limited run, it was popular.
[01:58:13.051 --> 01:58:20.433]  A big run just came in, and I'm gonna run this special for two weeks because of the flu and all the bacteria and viruses that are out there.
[01:58:20.433 --> 01:58:22.274]  This is what I'm taking, my children are taking.
[01:58:22.274 --> 01:58:26.075]  By the grace of God, we haven't got sick or gotten the flu yet in the last three months taking this.
[01:58:26.955 --> 01:58:28.496]  Ancient Defense is now available.
[01:58:28.496 --> 01:58:29.757]  It's normally $19.95.
[01:58:29.757 --> 01:58:32.479]  That's massively discounted.
[01:58:32.479 --> 01:58:33.119]  25% off.
[01:58:33.119 --> 01:58:33.200]  $14.95.
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:39.284]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:58:39.284 --> 01:58:41.866]  We don't get our money like commies from the government.
[01:58:41.866 --> 01:58:44.187]  We get it from you buying the products.
[01:58:44.187 --> 01:58:44.928]  Get it right now.
[01:58:44.928 --> 01:58:45.568]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:45.568 --> 01:58:46.469]  It's an incredible deal.
[01:58:49.304 --> 01:58:50.565]  Another major health threat.
[01:58:50.565 --> 01:58:55.527]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:58:55.527 --> 01:58:58.208]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:58:58.208 --> 01:59:05.251]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:59:05.251 --> 01:59:08.272]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:59:08.272 --> 01:59:11.193]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:59:11.193 --> 01:59:13.214]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:59:13.214 --> 01:59:16.055]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:59:16.135 --> 01:59:21.878]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:59:21.878 --> 01:59:25.380]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:28.482]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:59:28.482 --> 01:59:32.744]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.

[01:59:46.032 --> 01:59:47.113]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:05.151 --> 02:00:09.993]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.993 --> 02:00:11.574]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.574 --> 02:00:13.115]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.115 --> 02:00:17.317]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.317 --> 02:00:21.379]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.123 --> 02:00:34.306]  Alright, coming up in studio, Anthony Gucciardi's got breaking health news.
[02:00:34.306 --> 02:00:38.770]  We have Jerome Corsi joining us.
[02:00:38.770 --> 02:00:41.292]  Dr. Jerome Corsi with huge breaking news.
[02:00:41.292 --> 02:00:45.715]  Generals conclude Obama is backing Al Qaeda.
[02:00:45.715 --> 02:00:47.897]  Washington Times, how Obama arms Al Qaeda.
[02:00:49.594 --> 02:01:00.323]  It's a big deal that the establishment right wing and then the libertarian arm of the right wing is exposing that Al-Qaeda is being currently run by the government.
[02:01:00.323 --> 02:01:03.666]  Because they're not going to be able to put that genie back in the bottle when Republicans get in office.
[02:01:03.666 --> 02:01:06.308]  This is a victory on every front.
[02:01:06.308 --> 02:01:14.135]  It's a victory for Infowars.com, and it's a victory for the military that helped expose this the last three years with us.
[02:01:14.135 --> 02:01:16.838]  We've got the military we've got, we've got the republic we've got,
[02:01:17.694 --> 02:01:24.017]  The communist plan on bringing the government down, blaming capitalism for what's happened when insider elites did this.
[02:01:24.017 --> 02:01:27.878]  This is a carefully maneuvered program.
[02:01:27.878 --> 02:01:31.320]  And the left is being crushed right now because their program is so evil.
[02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:35.942]  So they're gutting the border, they're gutting the energy sources, trying to bankrupt us to make us dependent.
[02:01:35.942 --> 02:01:45.866]  That's why they've got leftists out trying to make contact with the libertarian movement and the real paleo-conservative movement to try to neutralize us and try to humanize them.
[02:01:47.625 --> 02:01:51.146]  And you just got a big dose of that in the last hour.
[02:01:51.146 --> 02:01:53.427]  A big dose of it.
[02:01:53.427 --> 02:01:58.349]  Because the left knows, and the foundations know, we are deprogramming leftists everywhere.
[02:01:58.349 --> 02:02:11.054]  They're buying guns, their women are actually becoming real women and slinging their power around, and everybody's having a good time, and women are figuring out how to empower their men, and men are figuring out how to empower their women and be on a damn team.
[02:02:12.344 --> 02:02:15.085]  Against the world, against the tyrants.
[02:02:15.085 --> 02:02:17.545]  People are not wanting to gut their kids.
[02:02:17.545 --> 02:02:21.446]  76% in Gallup of high school students don't want to kill babies.
[02:02:21.446 --> 02:02:24.246]  It was the opposite in 1974 in polls.
[02:02:24.246 --> 02:02:25.686]  We're winning!
[02:02:25.686 --> 02:02:28.587]  The culture war, and he knows it.
[02:02:28.587 --> 02:02:29.907]  You are the resistance.
[02:02:29.907 --> 02:02:32.748]  You have the power.
[02:02:32.748 --> 02:02:35.108]  We're not going to fight with the police, the military.
[02:02:35.108 --> 02:02:38.449]  We're going to walk in there and show them history, and they're going to know it.
[02:02:38.449 --> 02:02:39.189]  They already know it.
[02:02:39.189 --> 02:02:40.149]  We're going to remind them of it.
[02:02:40.964 --> 02:02:45.229]  We're not going to have the Civil War if we have our way.
[02:02:45.229 --> 02:02:58.845]  And when the leftists blow up federal buildings and wham it on us, our people will be there within minutes to document it and we'll jack you upside the head politically and that false flag will blow up in your face.
[02:02:58.845 --> 02:02:59.706]  We're not playing games.
[02:03:01.072 --> 02:03:12.117]  Humans that want renaissance and empowerment and true libertarian ideas, true diversity, true classical liberalism of live and let live, but you don't tell me how to live.
[02:03:12.117 --> 02:03:14.138]  You don't tell me how to raise my kids.
[02:03:14.138 --> 02:03:15.939]  You don't get all my money.
[02:03:15.939 --> 02:03:18.000]  You don't run my life.
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.841]  You get out of my life.
[02:03:19.841 --> 02:03:21.561]  Worldwide, that's what's popular.
[02:03:21.561 --> 02:03:23.402]  It's always been popular.
[02:03:23.402 --> 02:03:29.285]  And all you collectivists and the big corporations that set you up in power trying to turn us into dumbasses, excuse my French,
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:42.245]  You figured out having a bunch of drooling followers that can't tie their shoelaces and don't know what planet they're on, you might as well not have followers to begin with, because you can't even get their lazy butts to go vote for free stuff.
[02:03:42.245 --> 02:03:43.406]  That's how lazy they are!
[02:03:47.099 --> 02:04:03.615]  So, slowly but surely, the elite itself that isn't pure evil, I'm saying elite that isn't pure evil, there is pure evil there, but the ones that aren't pure evil are realizing this is really a destructive system and it doesn't feel good to them inside, to be part of a fraud.
[02:04:03.615 --> 02:04:05.156]  They want to build people up.
[02:04:05.156 --> 02:04:09.260]  So at the grassroots and at the top, we're hitting bottom.
[02:04:10.503 --> 02:04:19.654]  The whole system's beginning culturally to hit bottom, and folks are looking for alternatives, and they don't think it comes from Che Guevara, the hardcore racist against Hispanics.
[02:04:19.654 --> 02:04:22.297]  They know it doesn't come from aborting their black babies.
[02:04:22.297 --> 02:04:26.101]  They know it doesn't come from going and beating an old white man over the head with a hammer in St.
[02:04:26.101 --> 02:04:28.584]  Louis, and the media covers it up.
[02:04:28.584 --> 02:04:30.166]  It doesn't work anymore.
[02:04:31.587 --> 02:04:32.847]  People want freedom.
[02:04:32.847 --> 02:04:34.068]  They want prosperity.
[02:04:34.068 --> 02:04:35.208]  They want health.
[02:04:35.208 --> 02:04:36.468]  They want a future.
[02:04:36.468 --> 02:04:37.808]  They want goals.
[02:04:37.808 --> 02:04:42.230]  They want to build space colonies and undersea colonies.
[02:04:42.230 --> 02:04:43.450]  They want to explore.
[02:04:43.450 --> 02:04:48.911]  When they die, they want to know they handed the baton forward to another generation to do something even greater.
[02:04:48.911 --> 02:04:56.893]  Now, when we come back, one of the most devastating reports ever on the secret plan murdering veterans currently.
[02:04:59.378 --> 02:05:08.361]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[02:05:08.361 --> 02:05:18.905]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[02:05:18.905 --> 02:05:25.347]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:05:25.347 --> 02:05:26.968]  Secret 12 is a binary
[02:05:26.988 --> 02:05:29.150]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:05:29.150 --> 02:05:30.432]  No needles, no injections.
[02:05:30.432 --> 02:05:31.733]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:05:31.733 --> 02:05:32.274]  Try it for yourself.
[02:05:32.274 --> 02:05:32.955]  Discover the secret.
[02:05:48.852 --> 02:05:49.953]  Secret 12.

[02:06:11.070 --> 02:06:16.094]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:06:58.973 --> 02:07:06.141]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:07:06.141 --> 02:07:08.483]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:07:08.483 --> 02:07:13.769]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:07:13.769 --> 02:07:18.714]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:07:18.914 --> 02:07:22.235]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:07:22.235 --> 02:07:26.317]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:07:26.317 --> 02:07:30.639]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:07:30.639 --> 02:07:40.863]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:07:40.863 --> 02:07:43.384]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:07:43.584 --> 02:07:51.798]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:07:51.798 --> 02:07:55.784]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:28.044 --> 02:08:34.529]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:34.529 --> 02:08:39.473]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:39.473 --> 02:08:42.335]  Last night in Little Rock.
[02:08:42.335 --> 02:08:47.939]  Put me in a haze!
[02:08:47.939 --> 02:08:51.381]  She had the whole show and that's a natural fact.
[02:08:51.381 --> 02:08:53.323]  What's he talking about there?
[02:08:55.771 --> 02:08:59.853]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:08:59.853 --> 02:09:14.459]  The Nightly News, 7 o'clock tonight, for at least three hours live, before, during, and after Mystery Science Theater, because Obama is fiction, we'll be breaking down the commander-in-fraud up there pushing his garbage agenda.
[02:09:15.379 --> 02:09:17.883]  Then, coming up in 30 minutes.
[02:09:17.883 --> 02:09:21.749]  Generals conclude Obama backed Al Qaeda.
[02:09:21.749 --> 02:09:24.653]  World Daily report in depth.
[02:09:24.653 --> 02:09:28.099]  Dr. Jerome Carsey joining us, coming up.
[02:09:31.587 --> 02:09:37.668]  Now, this next report is the first report of several of an investigative, in-depth breakdown.
[02:09:37.668 --> 02:09:43.450]  We also dramatized some of how this IBM computer system operates.
[02:09:43.450 --> 02:09:45.510]  But this came out at NextGov.com.
[02:09:45.510 --> 02:09:49.731]  That's one of the big sites that just tracks government operations, government contracts.
[02:09:49.731 --> 02:09:51.512]  Got no attention.
[02:09:51.512 --> 02:09:56.293]  Because the big, huge things are hidden in plain view, like flatulence in church.
[02:09:57.213 --> 02:10:00.236]  No one quite knows where it came from, it just stinks.
[02:10:00.236 --> 02:10:05.101]  And then by the time people notice it's all over, you move on to the next abhorrent activity.
[02:10:06.653 --> 02:10:22.567]  Now, we began reporting last year when, and everybody saw it on the news, it was big national news, we covered it as well, that they had death panels, young, old, male, female, black, white, doesn't matter, veterans being put on secret death lists, not being given healthcare.
[02:10:22.567 --> 02:10:31.094]  And we told you folks, it's system-wide, it's not just rogue people, this is authorized, this is how death panels work, this is how healthcare works in Europe.
[02:10:32.455 --> 02:10:35.359]  You got lung cancer, it's operable, they don't give you surgery or die.
[02:10:35.359 --> 02:10:37.783]  You got brain cancer, it's operable, you don't get surgery.
[02:10:37.783 --> 02:10:40.587]  You need a knee worked on, they give you painkillers.
[02:10:40.587 --> 02:10:43.291]  Joe Biggs has been trying for years to get healthcare.
[02:10:43.291 --> 02:10:46.616]  He's got purple hearts, the whole nine yards, can't get it.
[02:10:46.616 --> 02:10:48.059]  Because he's on a death list.
[02:10:50.205 --> 02:10:52.186]  Joe Biggs has done a report on this.
[02:10:52.186 --> 02:10:54.606]  We're going to do other reports on it.
[02:10:54.606 --> 02:10:58.108]  VA turns to IBM Watson to improve veteran care.
[02:10:58.108 --> 02:11:06.890]  They said, oh, instead of humans deciding how to ration care, but the VA has a bigger budget all the time, we are going to have the computer do it.
[02:11:06.890 --> 02:11:10.172]  Well, this report gets into that.
[02:11:10.172 --> 02:11:17.334]  IBM started with race mixing study computers to decide how to control blacks on welfare.
[02:11:18.592 --> 02:11:21.194]  And how to give them a limited amount in New York, 1925.
[02:11:21.194 --> 02:11:23.935]  Then Hitler used the machines.
[02:11:23.935 --> 02:11:27.257]  Watson was one of the biggest Hitler supporters.
[02:11:27.257 --> 02:11:35.803]  He had technicians in the death camps running them, the machines with the tattoo number you put on them, decided how long you were worked, what you were fed, if you were killed right away.
[02:11:35.803 --> 02:11:39.485]  They put your measurements, your weight into the machine.
[02:11:39.485 --> 02:11:44.808]  They even call the new computer over the vets that will decide who to give care and who not to.
[02:11:44.808 --> 02:11:47.290]  So no humans have to feel bad now on the panels.
[02:11:48.086 --> 02:11:50.708]  The computer decides, so it's high-tech, who dies.
[02:11:50.708 --> 02:11:57.734]  So this is a robot killer brain called Watson, because I know the public doesn't know how sick this is.
[02:11:57.734 --> 02:12:01.016]  The IBM Watson Hollerith machine is what it's called.
[02:12:01.016 --> 02:12:03.158]  Well, Watson's back!
[02:12:03.158 --> 02:12:09.583]  And this time it's going to decide off your social security number and your military ID when to tap your butt.
[02:12:09.583 --> 02:12:14.286]  Let's go to this video report with Joe Biggs, then Anthony Gucciardi joins us with breaking news.
[02:12:14.286 --> 02:12:15.067]  Stay with us.
[02:12:15.067 --> 02:12:16.328]  Here is the shocking report.
[02:12:17.938 --> 02:12:19.020]  Spread this to everyone.
[02:12:19.020 --> 02:12:22.226]  We're going to post the video at InfoWars.com in the next 20 minutes.
[02:12:22.226 --> 02:12:22.907]  Get it out to everybody.
[02:12:31.075 --> 02:12:45.140]  Tonight, IBM, friend or foe, IBM has been announced as the winner of a long-term VA contract to modernize the electronic health records management system for the embattled VA.
[02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:52.563]  IBM will utilize the latest technologies to provide up-to-the-minute care for veterans all across this great country.
[02:12:53.103 --> 02:12:54.785]  The VA released a statement.
[02:12:54.785 --> 02:13:09.366]  We are serious about health of our nation's heroes and are sparing no expense to update, modernize, and create an efficient system to diagnose and provide real-time health care solutions for those who've served our country.
[02:13:09.847 --> 02:13:25.996]  We think IBM, a company that has a long history providing cutting-edge information technology solutions, for stepping in and providing leadership and experience that will be valuable to our country and save taxpayers money.
[02:13:25.996 --> 02:13:27.356]  Hold on.
[02:13:27.356 --> 02:13:29.558]  This isn't who we are.
[02:13:29.558 --> 02:13:30.198]  No.
[02:13:30.198 --> 02:13:31.779]  Give me those freaking cue cards, man!
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:35.640]  You know what?
[02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:36.581]  You know what's going to happen with this?
[02:13:36.581 --> 02:13:41.482]  You know what the implications are of this Watson program that's going to come up?
[02:13:41.482 --> 02:13:52.846]  It's a computer that they're going to use to replace the doctors at the VA, to do the death panels that have been going on, to help take away human emotion from making those decisions.
[02:13:52.846 --> 02:13:54.687]  This is something that's got to change.
[02:13:54.687 --> 02:14:00.669]  This is ridiculous, and I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com, and I'm not going to f***ing take it anymore.
[02:14:02.563 --> 02:14:06.684]  I'm standing outside of the Veterans Affairs Center in Austin, Texas.
[02:14:06.684 --> 02:14:12.066]  This will be the proving ground for IBM's brand new technology, Watson.
[02:14:12.066 --> 02:14:19.808]  Now what that is, is a supercomputer that will have all of your medical records, admin records, and many other things downloaded into it.
[02:14:19.808 --> 02:14:26.210]  They want to use this machine to replace the doctors that have had death panels going on at the VA for years now.
[02:14:26.630 --> 02:14:33.219]  Newly released documents expose more explicitly the details of IBM's pivotal role in the Holocaust.
[02:14:33.219 --> 02:14:41.930]  All six phases, identification, expulsion from society, confiscation, ghettoization, deportation, and even extermination.
[02:14:42.711 --> 02:14:57.277]  Moreover, the documents portray with crystal clarity the personal involvement and micromanagement of IBM President Thomas J. Watson and the company's co-planning and co-organizing of Hitler's campaign to destroy the Jews.
[02:14:57.277 --> 02:15:08.381]  Why is the Department of Veterans Affairs awarding IBM with a large contract to bring in Watson, a new technology that will be used to replace doctors in an already failing VA health system?
[02:15:09.281 --> 02:15:14.245]  Why are they naming it after Thomas J. Watson, the founder and president of IBM?
[02:15:14.245 --> 02:15:23.673]  Did you know this man was responsible for making the machines that created punch cards with a coding system to label and eventually kill thousands of Jews?
[02:15:23.673 --> 02:15:28.838]  This machine would generate codes to be tattooed on prisoners in Hitler's concentration camps.
[02:15:29.318 --> 02:15:36.902]  This man committed genocide by any standard and IBM and the VA want to throw it in our face clear as day and name it after that monster.
[02:15:36.902 --> 02:15:39.084]  If this doesn't piss you off, I don't know what will.
[02:15:40.097 --> 02:15:51.468]  Hitler was so impressed with what Watson had done for the Third Reich that he awarded him with a special award, created specifically for the occasion, to honor extraordinary service by a foreigner.
[02:15:51.468 --> 02:15:59.536]  The medal was the order of the German eagle with star, bedecked with swastikas, and was to be worn on a sash over Watson's cold, dead heart.
[02:15:59.536 --> 02:16:02.619]  Why do they want to put a machine in charge of your health, you might ask yourself?
[02:16:03.527 --> 02:16:14.655]  They do it so this pre-programmed evil robot can make the life or death decisions about you, the veteran, instead of the doctors that have received so much flack from the VA scandal over the last year.
[02:16:14.655 --> 02:16:22.461]  This helps take human emotions away and also allows the medical personnel to use Watson as a scapegoat should any problems arise, like death.
[02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:30.393]  Watson will be a new form of medical AI technology used to run the death panels already in place at the VA.
[02:16:30.393 --> 02:16:34.735]  How soon will it be until this technology moves over into civilian healthcare?
[02:16:34.735 --> 02:16:36.556]  Will you be a victim of Watson's wrath?
[02:16:37.318 --> 02:16:40.439]  This is also happening in another area of the government.
[02:16:40.439 --> 02:16:45.881]  They now want to replace humans that fly drones and make them fully autonomous.
[02:16:45.881 --> 02:16:48.942]  And many pilots were also claiming PTSD.
[02:16:48.942 --> 02:16:54.083]  Once you take the human aspect out of dealing with healthcare and war, things become even more evil.
[02:16:54.083 --> 02:16:58.204]  Who is going to check the morals of the men and women who program these machines?
[02:16:58.204 --> 02:17:02.406]  How do we know the machines will be told to act ethical and make the right decisions?
[02:17:03.106 --> 02:17:03.726]  Well there you have it.
[02:17:03.726 --> 02:17:10.049]  That is the new Watson technology that's going to run the death panels at the already failing VA health care system.
[02:17:10.049 --> 02:17:15.031]  Now I have a vision of how this Watson technology will be implemented when you walk into the VA.
[02:17:15.031 --> 02:17:16.312]  Let's go in here and take a look.
[02:17:32.304 --> 02:17:36.245]  You're a radio listener.
[02:17:36.245 --> 02:17:43.007]  They barcode them, take them in, and basically disintegrate them.
[02:17:43.007 --> 02:17:46.187]  Alright, uh, Watson has determined you need to step into the medical chamber.
[02:17:46.187 --> 02:17:47.208]  So, uh, go ahead.
[02:17:47.208 --> 02:17:50.348]  But instead, they just let you go home and die, so it's okay.
[02:17:50.348 --> 02:17:54.649]  But if they were actually vaporizing you, people would get up in arms.
[02:17:54.649 --> 02:17:58.950]  These are death panels.
[02:17:58.950 --> 02:17:59.491]  What's going on?
[02:17:59.491 --> 02:18:00.931]  But we care about our veterans so much.
[02:18:05.495 --> 02:18:09.879]  He actually looks like one of those hippie, Grizzly Adams type doctors they have that want to exterminate everybody.
[02:18:09.879 --> 02:18:18.306]  I'm joking.
[02:18:18.306 --> 02:18:20.467]  Alright, that report is powerful.
[02:18:20.467 --> 02:18:22.069]  Joe Biggs has been here less than a year.
[02:18:22.069 --> 02:18:24.090]  He's doing a fabulous job.
[02:18:24.090 --> 02:18:25.452]  And that's what it is.
[02:18:25.452 --> 02:18:28.454]  It's a computer to decide how to ration care.
[02:18:28.454 --> 02:18:31.296]  And under Obamacare, now computers are telling doctors everywhere
[02:18:32.276 --> 02:18:34.518]  Even into smaller clinics, what they can and can't do.
[02:18:34.518 --> 02:18:37.320]  I mean, this is getting humans out of the decision-making process.
[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:43.585]  Already the drones are converting to autonomous, where they're just programmed and humans aren't involved.
[02:18:43.585 --> 02:18:46.187]  Oh, humans have a problem killing people with the drones?
[02:18:46.187 --> 02:18:48.308]  Well, just get humans out of there!
[02:18:48.308 --> 02:18:52.492]  We're building a world where we're not needed, and the globalists admit that's the plan.
[02:18:52.492 --> 02:18:54.653]  It's not just, hey, we can see where this goes.
[02:18:54.653 --> 02:18:55.594]  It's dangerous.
[02:18:55.594 --> 02:18:56.295]  It's a plan!
[02:18:57.398 --> 02:19:02.102]  That video is going up on InfoWars.com in the next 15 minutes or so.
[02:19:02.102 --> 02:19:03.803]  We'll tweet it at RealAlexJones.
[02:19:03.803 --> 02:19:05.545]  Now, Anthony Gucciardi is with us in the next segment.
[02:19:05.545 --> 02:19:09.067]  A little bit into the next before Dr. Corsi joins us.
[02:19:09.067 --> 02:19:11.089]  You've got a lot of breaking health news.
[02:19:11.089 --> 02:19:12.750]  Give us a few of the stories that are coming up.
[02:19:12.750 --> 02:19:13.851]  We're going to break in 30 seconds.
[02:19:13.851 --> 02:19:16.934]  Well, it's absolutely essential to understand that the flu season is coming.
[02:19:16.934 --> 02:19:22.258]  It's one of the worst in recent history and here's what we can do about it and here's what not to do about it in every single way possible.
[02:19:22.358 --> 02:19:24.020]  Mention a few of those articles, you've got a bunch.
[02:19:37.375 --> 02:19:37.895]  Stay with us.
[02:19:59.384 --> 02:20:01.824]  Attention all radio listeners.
[02:20:01.824 --> 02:20:09.566]  Survival Life is giving away free credit card knives exclusively to our radio listeners here today.

[02:20:28.929 --> 02:20:31.650]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[02:20:31.650 --> 02:20:35.951]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[02:20:35.951 --> 02:20:37.352]  Silverlungs.com.
[02:20:37.352 --> 02:20:40.033]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[02:20:40.033 --> 02:20:43.014]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[02:20:43.014 --> 02:20:45.374]  The Silverlungs generator allows you to make your own.
[02:20:45.374 --> 02:20:47.275]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[02:20:47.275 --> 02:20:52.837]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[02:20:52.837 --> 02:20:56.458]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[02:20:56.638 --> 02:20:58.420]  That's silverlungs.com.
[02:20:58.420 --> 02:20:59.741]  The experts are clear.
[02:20:59.741 --> 02:21:06.848]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:21:06.848 --> 02:21:11.552]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[02:21:13.093 --> 02:21:16.834]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary nascent iodine formula.
[02:21:16.834 --> 02:21:21.055]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:21:21.055 --> 02:21:26.376]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:21:26.376 --> 02:21:27.376]  Not our iodine.
[02:21:27.376 --> 02:21:31.196]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[02:21:31.196 --> 02:21:33.737]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.
[02:21:33.737 --> 02:21:35.757]  Visit Infowarslife.com today.
[02:21:35.757 --> 02:21:37.337]  See the informational videos.
[02:21:37.337 --> 02:21:39.298]  Read the information there compiled.
[02:21:39.298 --> 02:21:40.338]  And for a limited time,
[02:21:40.478 --> 02:21:42.259]  Mom, I can't do my math homework!
[02:21:42.259 --> 02:21:43.459]  I just don't get it!
[02:21:43.459 --> 02:21:43.759]  I hate math!
[02:22:02.955 --> 02:22:07.336]  I've always tried to be a good mother, but when it came to Jamie's math, I was at a loss.
[02:22:07.336 --> 02:22:10.177]  Then a friend told me about Math Made Easy DVDs.

[02:22:27.694 --> 02:22:30.576]  My name is Del and I live in El Cajon, California.
[02:22:30.576 --> 02:22:39.461]  I was concerned about my cholesterol readings because I knew that high cholesterol is related to clogging of the arteries and increases the risk for heart attack and stroke.
[02:22:39.461 --> 02:22:45.644]  One day I heard an ad for Heart and Body Extract and I was skeptical, but I decided to give it a try.

[02:23:28.214 --> 02:23:29.215]  Hey, Boomer!
[02:23:29.215 --> 02:23:32.656]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:23:32.656 --> 02:23:34.317]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[02:23:34.317 --> 02:23:36.277]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:23:36.277 --> 02:23:42.119]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:23:42.119 --> 02:23:42.940]  I know, right?
[02:23:42.940 --> 02:23:44.260]  You love it, too!
[02:23:44.260 --> 02:23:45.701]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[02:23:45.701 --> 02:23:46.721]  Let's go get some!
[02:23:46.721 --> 02:23:48.442]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653.
[02:23:48.442 --> 02:23:48.902]  That's 877-886-3653.

[02:24:08.383 --> 02:24:10.484]  Chewbacca has pneumonia.
[02:24:10.484 --> 02:24:15.266]  That's out of the London Independent newspaper and they hope he doesn't die.
[02:24:15.266 --> 02:24:20.488]  That is the actor that plays the seven foot tall bipedal gorilla creature.
[02:24:21.628 --> 02:24:28.556]  Uh, that is more real than Barack Obama saying he wants to save the middle class in his stupid speech coming up tonight.
[02:24:28.556 --> 02:24:30.398]  Uh, Anthony, go over these headlines.
[02:24:30.398 --> 02:24:33.922]  I mean, last year was a record bad of mystery illness and deaths.
[02:24:33.922 --> 02:24:34.743]  Now it's even worse.
[02:24:34.743 --> 02:24:36.705]  We have Dr. Group Emily, the mainline headlines that
[02:24:37.185 --> 02:24:45.690]  The flu and other mystery illnesses are tied directly to the flu vaccine, and they admit again, doesn't protect you like every year, but the idiots go out and get the shot.
[02:24:45.690 --> 02:24:46.791]  Anthony Gucciardi.
[02:24:46.791 --> 02:24:51.514]  Last year we know there was a lot of mystery illness, and I do want to talk about pneumonia because it affected you personally.
[02:24:51.514 --> 02:24:54.216]  In effect, I had it as well, but it affected your family and everything.
[02:24:54.216 --> 02:24:57.158]  Took me until I did heroic amounts of silver.
[02:24:57.158 --> 02:24:57.738]  I couldn't get rid of it.
[02:24:57.938 --> 02:25:05.644]  Yeah, you know, for me it was, I didn't even full-fledged get it, I felt it coming on and I felt the sickness happening and I knew what to do right away to stop it with silver and everything like that.
[02:25:05.644 --> 02:25:06.865]  Yeah, you were guzzling silver.
[02:25:06.865 --> 02:25:07.326]  Yes.
[02:25:07.326 --> 02:25:13.991]  But, so this year is on record now, one of the worst in recent history, if not the worst.
[02:25:13.991 --> 02:25:21.277]  And if we look at the flu charts, it's just off the record, off the charts, Austin, Dallas, you name it, all of Texas.
[02:25:21.277 --> 02:25:22.858]  It's always hitting the South in Texas.
[02:25:22.938 --> 02:25:29.140]  It's hitting everywhere, but what's interesting is they lump all of these different illnesses into what they categorize as the flu.
[02:25:29.140 --> 02:25:32.301]  So it could also be a bunch of other things, a bunch of mystery illnesses.
[02:25:32.301 --> 02:25:37.243]  And then everyone goes out and they get their flu shot for the flu and for whatever they have, even for pneumonia.
[02:25:37.243 --> 02:25:39.144]  Then that lowers immunity and the regular flu spreads.
[02:25:39.144 --> 02:25:39.604]  Exactly.
[02:25:39.604 --> 02:25:42.325]  And my thing here is that MSNBC...
[02:25:43.365 --> 02:25:47.087]  Morning Joe, this is their post, their featured post.
[02:25:47.087 --> 02:25:50.649]  Your 2015 flu shot probably isn't working.
[02:25:50.649 --> 02:25:53.110]  This year's flu vaccine is only 23% effective.
[02:25:53.110 --> 02:25:58.273]  And by the way, the 23% number is from the blogs like WebMD that are heavily subbed.
[02:25:58.273 --> 02:26:07.337]  And by the way, that's because some people are getting a type of flu, but a different variant of one of the ones it covers, but it doesn't even cover that because it's not the right mutation.
[02:26:07.337 --> 02:26:09.498]  It's bull on top of bull.
[02:26:09.498 --> 02:26:10.579]  It never works.
[02:26:10.579 --> 02:26:10.919]  Ever.
[02:26:10.919 --> 02:26:12.920]  And this is just mainline WebMD.
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:13.560]  I don't know.
[02:26:37.619 --> 02:26:40.440]  You know what's the most racist, though, is I'm going to offer solutions.
[02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:42.160]  I'm going to offer... Oh, no, don't do that.
[02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:47.302]  Seriously, folks, we've had this for three months in a limited supply.
[02:26:47.302 --> 02:26:54.864]  We are doing, again, a discounted type product line called Right Side that Anthony and I and Dr. Group and others came up with.
[02:26:54.864 --> 02:27:06.828]  And this is well-known, ancient defense, herbal immunity complex that is well-known, ancient herbs, purified, organic, concentrated, but we cut out the ones that are super expensive so it's affordable.
[02:27:07.728 --> 02:27:12.410]  A similar formula is up to $39.35 when it's discounted.
[02:27:12.410 --> 02:27:19.532]  This is $19.95, but out of the gates, we're offering Ancient Defense for two weeks, or while supplies last, for $14.95.
[02:27:19.532 --> 02:27:21.073]  No one can offer something like that.
[02:27:21.073 --> 02:27:22.653]  It is a big bottle of it.
[02:27:22.653 --> 02:27:24.494]  I've been giving it to my children every day.
[02:27:24.494 --> 02:27:25.674]  I've been taking it every day.
[02:27:25.674 --> 02:27:26.835]  Amazing.
[02:27:26.835 --> 02:27:28.235]  Haven't got sick yet.
[02:27:28.235 --> 02:27:30.796]  Anthony, tell folks what's in Ancient Defense.
[02:27:30.956 --> 02:27:35.679]  And if you're going to get this at a brick and mortar store like Whole Foods, it would be easily $60.
[02:27:35.679 --> 02:27:37.460]  So what we do is we source the highest quality.
[02:27:37.460 --> 02:27:40.142]  Yeah, we're being conservative when we say $35 to $40.
[02:27:40.142 --> 02:27:40.722]  Yes.
[02:27:40.722 --> 02:27:41.503]  We bring it in.
[02:27:41.503 --> 02:27:42.964]  We sell it at the lowest possible prices.
[02:27:42.964 --> 02:27:45.665]  You actually wanted to discount it before we went on air today.
[02:27:45.665 --> 02:27:46.986]  From $19.95 to $14.95.
[02:27:46.986 --> 02:27:48.527]  That was already a really good deal.
[02:27:48.527 --> 02:27:48.607]  Yes.
[02:27:48.607 --> 02:27:49.528]  But I just said no.
[02:27:50.956 --> 02:27:53.038]  I want to give people the very best deal because it's good karma.
[02:27:53.038 --> 02:27:53.819]  It's good mojo.
[02:27:53.819 --> 02:27:55.440]  I'm obsessed with that because it absolutely works.
[02:27:55.440 --> 02:27:56.081]  It's true.
[02:27:56.081 --> 02:27:57.862]  And I'm not doing it for the right reason, too.
[02:27:57.862 --> 02:28:02.526]  I want people to get this and to battle against all this garbage that's out there.
[02:28:02.526 --> 02:28:03.968]  Well, that's why we called it RightSide.
[02:28:03.968 --> 02:28:08.692]  So in my mind, and as we talked about, there's two ways you can approach your health.
[02:28:08.692 --> 02:28:12.616]  There is the RightSide, organic-based, healing yourself.
[02:28:12.616 --> 02:28:16.139]  And then there's, of course, going in and getting injected with hormones and antibiotics.
[02:28:16.559 --> 02:28:19.220]  And you know, we're not saying that these two are comparable on the same level.
[02:28:19.220 --> 02:28:19.861]  It's totally different.
[02:28:19.861 --> 02:28:22.102]  You're taking your health into your own hands with this.
[02:28:22.102 --> 02:28:24.884]  This is being on the right side of your health.
[02:28:24.884 --> 02:28:26.444]  I do want to go through some studies.
[02:28:26.444 --> 02:28:28.385]  We have some time here, because they're really powerful.
[02:28:28.385 --> 02:28:36.010]  There's 400 different pieces from PubMed, which is the National Library of Medicine from Congress, that are showing some of the ingredients that we've used and cultivated.
[02:28:36.010 --> 02:28:38.631]  This is concentrated elderberry, ginger root, echinacea.
[02:28:38.631 --> 02:28:40.272]  That's only three of how many ingredients?
[02:28:40.945 --> 02:28:41.305]  Numerous.
[02:28:41.305 --> 02:28:42.326]  There's like 20?
[02:28:42.326 --> 02:28:46.228]  What we did is we've refactored, remanufactured so many different times with these formulas.
[02:28:46.228 --> 02:29:06.159]  We've gone back and forth like what 35 times now and found the best because we could find certain organic ingredients and let's say they're from India right and they're super clean ultra pure tested and we'd say well that would make it $50 right and we'd find something comparable that's just as good with all the research from PubMed and that's why we've made such a yeah this is a discount brand line we're coming out with
[02:29:07.279 --> 02:29:08.499]  I mean, take DNA Force.
[02:29:08.499 --> 02:29:12.080]  It's a super-neutromedical at about a third the price it should be.
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:12.881]  Comparables are $600.
[02:29:12.881 --> 02:29:14.181]  This is $140.
[02:29:14.181 --> 02:29:18.482]  Or our nascent iodine's already pretty discounted, but it's $29.95.
[02:29:18.482 --> 02:29:26.745]  I mean, we're just coming out with a discount line that is the very best stuff we can get for the price and that has incredible bang for the buck.
[02:29:27.225 --> 02:29:29.867]  And the small profit we make funds the operation.
[02:29:29.867 --> 02:29:30.668]  So win, win, win.
[02:29:30.668 --> 02:29:34.390]  High quality product, boosts your immunity, really good for your body.

[02:29:38.894 --> 02:29:48.061]  We're going to come back, hit a few of these studies, and then go to Dr. Jerome Corsi on top military brass saying, yes, Obama is behind Al-Qaeda.
[02:29:48.061 --> 02:29:48.601]  This is huge.
[02:29:48.601 --> 02:29:49.502]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.502 --> 02:29:49.942]  Huge.
[02:29:49.942 --> 02:29:52.484]  But they would have the courage to come out with us.
[02:29:52.484 --> 02:29:54.245]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.474 --> 02:30:00.735]  Another major health threat.
[02:30:00.735 --> 02:30:05.697]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:30:05.697 --> 02:30:08.378]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:30:08.378 --> 02:30:15.421]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:30:15.421 --> 02:30:18.442]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:30:18.442 --> 02:30:21.363]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:30:21.363 --> 02:30:23.384]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:30:23.384 --> 02:30:26.205]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:30:26.305 --> 02:30:32.027]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:30:32.027 --> 02:30:35.528]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:30:35.528 --> 02:30:38.629]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:31:59.315 --> 02:32:02.976]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:32:02.976 --> 02:32:07.258]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:32:07.258 --> 02:32:09.038]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:32:09.038 --> 02:32:14.360]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.

[02:33:08.690 --> 02:33:12.733]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:12.733 --> 02:33:18.317]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:18.317 --> 02:33:22.560]  The article is on Infowars.com.
[02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:28.364]  We're linked to the full article at WorldNetDaily.com, WND.com.
[02:33:28.364 --> 02:33:32.687]  Generals conclude Obama backed Al Qaeda.
[02:33:32.687 --> 02:33:36.650]  Dr. Jerome Corsi of WorldNetDaily, best-selling author and researcher,
[02:33:38.243 --> 02:33:39.184]  Came on on short notice.
[02:33:39.184 --> 02:33:40.484]  He's only with us for about 15 minutes.
[02:33:40.484 --> 02:33:45.007]  We're going to him in just a moment to break this down.
[02:33:45.007 --> 02:33:47.168]  Our military knows what's going on.
[02:33:47.168 --> 02:33:48.109]  This is a big deal.
[02:33:48.109 --> 02:33:49.890]  This could bring down the system.
[02:33:49.890 --> 02:34:02.598]  The military concludes in this article with sources that there's basically a coup in the government and they're actually planning to turn much of the world over to radical Islamists with Saudi Arabia.
[02:34:05.865 --> 02:34:08.049]  And we know this is happening through Kenya.
[02:34:08.049 --> 02:34:08.730]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:34:08.730 --> 02:34:11.976]  We're going to talk about this in just a moment.
[02:34:11.976 --> 02:34:15.022]  Then in the final segment, Anthony Gucciardi will be back.
[02:34:15.022 --> 02:34:17.246]  But before we go to Dr. Corsi...
[02:34:18.430 --> 02:34:36.886]  Finish up mentioning those studies on what ancient defense compounds, the compounds that are based on organic systems in ancient defense, do for people, versus the flu shot they admit doesn't protect you from the flu, ends up lowering your immune system, giving you the flu, when sunshine and vitamin C on record is better than that.
[02:34:36.886 --> 02:34:38.147]  I mean, it's kind of like...
[02:34:39.525 --> 02:34:39.765]  St.
[02:34:39.765 --> 02:34:45.631]  John's warts in all these studies is better than Prozac, but they won't tell people that it's what your body already needs.
[02:34:45.631 --> 02:34:48.854]  And it's available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:34:48.854 --> 02:34:52.397]  It's what I'm taking, what my children are taking, and it's discounted.
[02:34:52.397 --> 02:34:56.181]  This new right side ancient defense from Infowarslife.com.
[02:34:57.822 --> 02:34:59.283]  Herbal Immunity Complex.
[02:34:59.283 --> 02:35:00.664]  I'm really proud of this.
[02:35:00.664 --> 02:35:02.566]  We could easily sell it for $40.
[02:35:02.566 --> 02:35:05.348]  That's what the competitors are and more.
[02:35:05.348 --> 02:35:05.828]  $14.95.
[02:35:05.828 --> 02:35:07.289]  Not compromising.
[02:35:07.289 --> 02:35:08.150]  Highest quality.
[02:35:08.150 --> 02:35:08.971]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:35:10.128 --> 02:35:11.829]  You talk about the flu shot, you talk about Prozac.
[02:35:11.829 --> 02:35:14.011]  They knew for decades it caused suicide.
[02:35:14.011 --> 02:35:15.573]  Professors from Harvard spoke out.
[02:35:15.573 --> 02:35:16.994]  We're going to talk about natural alternatives.
[02:35:16.994 --> 02:35:24.760]  I'm going to highlight the exact key components that you need, some of which are also in herbal, uh, ancient defense, herbal resistance, community complex we've developed.
[02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:28.423]  But specifically, just a few studies we're going to talk about real quick that we're going to go into.
[02:35:28.423 --> 02:35:31.846]  Elderberry appears to be safe and effective treatment for influenza A and B.
[02:35:33.027 --> 02:35:37.590]  Elderberry significantly reduces the duration of infection from influenza in a safe manner.
[02:35:37.590 --> 02:35:39.132]  Again, this is all public.
[02:35:39.132 --> 02:35:43.515]  National Library of Medicine, Congress, PubMed Studies.
[02:35:43.515 --> 02:35:47.798]  Elderberry stimulates production of the healthy immune system to fight off viral infection.
[02:35:47.798 --> 02:35:49.259]  Nope, vaccinated.
[02:35:49.259 --> 02:35:52.561]  Elderberry flavonoids bind to and prevent H1N1 infection.
[02:35:53.602 --> 02:35:55.103]  Ginger, we'll get into as well.
[02:35:55.103 --> 02:36:02.165]  Ginger supplementation is an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes and also AIDS and pregnancy, HIV.
[02:36:02.165 --> 02:36:05.447]  All of this is in here concentrated, highest quality.
[02:36:05.447 --> 02:36:09.028]  We can keep the price low because a few things that are fancy aren't in there.
[02:36:09.028 --> 02:36:11.889]  But it's got like 20 ingredients concentrated.
[02:36:11.889 --> 02:36:12.729]  It's over the top.
[02:36:12.729 --> 02:36:13.550]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:36:14.130 --> 02:36:17.732]  We'll talk about all this and show those studies and detail them in the final segment.
[02:36:17.732 --> 02:36:18.673]  Thank you, Anthony.
[02:36:18.673 --> 02:36:18.973]  Thank you.
[02:36:18.973 --> 02:36:22.856]  Stay there because you may have some comments as one of our journalists for Dr. Corsi.
[02:36:22.856 --> 02:36:29.040]  Dr. Corsi of WorldNetDaily.com, WND.com joins us no stranger to this broadcast.
[02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:31.342]  One of the most important articles he's ever done.
[02:36:32.190 --> 02:36:32.891]  In my opinion.
[02:36:52.032 --> 02:36:55.418]  is that this appears to be a complete realignment.
[02:36:55.418 --> 02:36:58.023]  So to break this down is Dr. Corsi.
[02:36:58.023 --> 02:37:01.429]  You've got the floor, sir, for the next 14 minutes before we go to break.
[02:37:01.429 --> 02:37:03.613]  Please give us a special report on what's happening.
[02:37:03.613 --> 02:37:04.454]  Please give us a briefing.
[02:37:05.120 --> 02:37:22.850]  Well, Alex, I've been interviewing a lot of the members of this Citizens' Commission on Benghazi, which include really top admirals and generals who are very aware and some of them involved in the situation in Benghazi when the attack was occurring on 9-11 in 2012.
[02:37:22.850 --> 02:37:31.475]  What is the case is they've proved that a decision was made by the Obama administration
[02:37:33.476 --> 02:38:02.227]  Really about 2011, March 2011, that we were going to switch sides in the war on terror and that we were are going to, we're going to have supported the Al-Qaeda affiliated militia in Libya that we know to be under the political control of the Muslim Brotherhood and that we in fact, and I detail in the article the evidence that supports this, established Christopher Stevens as our first
[02:38:03.224 --> 02:38:23.252]  Envoy to Al Qaeda and his mission what he was doing in Al Qaeda was running a fast and furious gun operation bringing weapons in from Eastern Europe through Qatar and getting them into the Al Qaeda affiliated Militia in Libya in order to overthrow Qaddafi.
[02:38:23.252 --> 02:38:25.173]  I mean, that's remarkable.
[02:38:25.173 --> 02:38:29.635]  We were funding providing weapons to established
[02:38:30.586 --> 02:38:52.921]  Benghazi is our special diplomatic compound operating post, right next to the CIA annex from which Ambassador Chris Stevens, before he was ambassador, he came in on a cargo ship, this is 2011, was running guns, unbeknownst to the American people, into our new allies, which are the Al-Qaeda militia in Libya.
[02:38:52.921 --> 02:38:56.943]  That was the Obama administration's decision and the policy follows from there.
[02:38:56.943 --> 02:38:57.724]  It's fundamental
[02:38:58.624 --> 02:39:09.027]  That listeners understand that Obama changed sides in the war on terror and decided that we would ally with Al Qaeda to bring down Qaddafi in Libya.
[02:39:09.027 --> 02:39:12.588]  I mean, it's shocking.
[02:39:12.588 --> 02:39:14.849]  To be absolutely honest with you, it's shocking.
[02:39:14.849 --> 02:39:20.590]  Now, you could talk for 10 hours on this, but condensing it down, you had this intel years ago.
[02:39:20.590 --> 02:39:26.472]  I confirmed it with Colonel Schaefer and others on the inside that have been in Congress in these briefings that are classified.
[02:39:28.203 --> 02:39:30.484]  That your analysis is dead on.
[02:39:30.484 --> 02:39:37.046]  They know that 95% of the fighters in Syria are Al-Qaeda, so they had them change the name to ISIS to confuse the public.
[02:39:37.046 --> 02:39:41.488]  From your intel, is this really another bait-and-switch now?
[02:39:42.657 --> 02:39:58.229]  Where they claim that the US and NATO and Turkey are allied with Iran against Saudi Arabia and Al Qaeda, or is it another double cross where they're really still arming Al Qaeda as the Iraqi government is saying they've caught them doing?
[02:39:58.229 --> 02:40:08.497]  Because every indicator I see is they're attempting to look like they're doing both, but that they're not really engaged in real strikes against Al Qaeda, and that this is a triple cross.
[02:40:09.571 --> 02:40:19.357]  Well, in the series of stories that I'm writing, I've interviewed former CIA operatives who make it clear that we're playing both sides.
[02:40:19.357 --> 02:40:34.245]  We're playing both encouraging Iran to enter as our supposed allies to defeat ISIS, while at the same time, what Christopher Stevens was doing at the time of his death, was diverting weapons from Libya
[02:40:35.054 --> 02:40:42.842]  Through Turkey to Al Qaeda groups fighting Assad, many of those Al Qaeda groups became ISIS.
[02:40:42.842 --> 02:40:52.652]  It's fundamental to understand that we in a sense created ISIS and provided the weaponry and the funding through Libya.
[02:40:53.591 --> 02:40:53.611]  I
[02:41:07.506 --> 02:41:10.629]  Obama has gone completely onto the other side.
[02:41:10.629 --> 02:41:24.141]  He's now supporting Al-Qaeda, he's supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, he's supporting the Shiites in Iran, even though they're developing nuclear weapons that they could potentially use against
[02:41:25.021 --> 02:41:25.682]  Israel.
[02:41:25.682 --> 02:41:29.685]  Okay, so to be clear, what you're getting at is... With our enemies.
[02:41:29.685 --> 02:41:30.286]  I understand.
[02:41:30.286 --> 02:41:34.930]  So it's not he's either on the side of the Wahhabist or he's on the side of the Shiites.
[02:41:34.930 --> 02:41:48.682]  Are you saying that beneath the surface this is really allying with the Muslims period, whether they be Shiite or Sunni, and that this is a master plan to turn Africa, the Middle East, and much of Central Asia over to them?
[02:41:49.272 --> 02:41:51.735]  Into a radical Islamic hotbed.
[02:41:51.735 --> 02:41:52.757]  That's correct.
[02:41:52.757 --> 02:41:53.378]  I agree with that.
[02:41:53.378 --> 02:41:54.019]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:41:54.019 --> 02:41:55.060]  So they don't care now.
[02:41:55.060 --> 02:41:56.942]  It's fun to everybody who's radical.
[02:41:56.942 --> 02:41:57.663]  We're not.
[02:41:57.663 --> 02:42:01.549]  We're no longer fighting radical Islamic terrorism.
[02:42:01.549 --> 02:42:02.810]  We're funding it and arming it.
[02:42:03.996 --> 02:42:12.803]  And is that why, starting in 2011, Big Sis came out and said, we're no longer worried about Islamic terror, we're only focused on Tea Party and gun owners?
[02:42:12.803 --> 02:42:24.052]  Right, because the White House has abandoned the idea that there is Islamic terror, except maybe for some hotheads that do a deed that becomes a little bit too obnoxious.
[02:42:24.052 --> 02:42:28.976]  So Obama wants to be able to distance himself from the particular ones he doesn't like.
[02:42:28.976 --> 02:42:33.480]  But we're still supporting radical Islamic terrorism, and the administration will not
[02:42:34.395 --> 02:42:36.698]  Say our enemy is radical Islamic extremists.
[02:42:36.698 --> 02:42:42.044]  Well, I had Ahmad Salam on as a big FBI informant and former colonel in the Egyptian military.
[02:42:42.044 --> 02:42:42.745]  Very respected.
[02:42:42.745 --> 02:42:45.308]  Even the New York Times says his credentials are impeccable.
[02:42:45.308 --> 02:42:51.095]  He said your analysis is dead on and that from his sources in intelligence, they're totally freaked out in Egypt.
[02:42:51.716 --> 02:42:54.238]  Well, I'm only part way through this series of articles.
[02:43:20.675 --> 02:43:20.855]  I think?
[02:43:38.998 --> 02:43:40.759]  This is extending over to Hezbollah.
[02:43:40.759 --> 02:43:48.720]  I mean, soon I think you're going to find a regional war involving Hezbollah, even potentially Hezbollah joining with Iran against Israel.
[02:43:48.720 --> 02:43:54.642]  You now see France and others lining up against Israel, and even if people don't... France will not support Israel.
[02:43:54.642 --> 02:43:57.943]  France will be on the side of the radical Islamic terrorists, too.
[02:43:57.943 --> 02:44:00.063]  I mean, they're appeasing right now.
[02:44:00.063 --> 02:44:03.024]  France is the radical Islamicists, and
[02:44:03.744 --> 02:44:14.927]  Obama is at the center of this duplicity because he's not come out and told the American people that we've... Al-Qaeda is no longer our enemy.
[02:44:14.927 --> 02:44:16.228]  We're sided with Al-Qaeda.
[02:44:16.228 --> 02:44:17.308]  We've funded Al-Qaeda.
[02:44:17.308 --> 02:44:18.928]  We've armed Al-Qaeda.
[02:44:18.928 --> 02:44:21.309]  This is what Chris Stevens was doing.
[02:44:21.309 --> 02:44:23.189]  This was the whole plan.
[02:44:23.189 --> 02:44:25.850]  We supported the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:44:25.850 --> 02:44:31.852]  LCC in Egypt right now, as soon as he came into power, Obama quit funding him.
[02:44:31.852 --> 02:44:32.192]  Obama
[02:44:33.101 --> 02:44:42.446]  You know, El-Sisi has called out Obama and said Obama has supported the Muslim Brotherhood, which is going back to World War II.
[02:44:42.446 --> 02:44:43.847]  Not signed with Hitler.
[02:44:43.847 --> 02:44:51.591]  They've been a radical Islamic destabilizing force determined to destroy Israel and then to destroy the United States.
[02:44:51.591 --> 02:44:54.572]  And our White House, our CIA,
[02:44:57.054 --> 02:45:03.078]  Our State Department under Hillary Clinton have all embraced supporting Al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:45:03.078 --> 02:45:16.968]  Well, by the way, Dr. Gorsy, I would hear you say this, and you weren't going this far six years ago because it hadn't happened yet, but you were warning of this, and I would debate you and say, come on, they want to get radicalism out of control as an excuse to have no-bid contracts and keep some wars going.
[02:45:17.808 --> 02:45:18.729]  But no, you were right.
[02:45:18.729 --> 02:45:22.352]  This is a plan to turn it loose and to take over much of the world.
[02:45:22.352 --> 02:45:24.333]  And anybody that stands in the way of it is attacked.
[02:45:24.333 --> 02:45:26.915]  But, I mean, I criticize some of the elements in Israel.
[02:45:26.915 --> 02:45:28.076]  I'm not an Israel firster.
[02:45:28.076 --> 02:45:29.117]  I'm an American.
[02:45:29.117 --> 02:45:31.739]  I don't like some of the lobbying Israel does here in the U.S.
[02:45:31.739 --> 02:45:33.140]  I don't like any country doing that.
[02:45:33.140 --> 02:45:35.282]  I don't like China doing that, telling Hollywood what to do.
[02:45:35.282 --> 02:45:36.303]  But, that said...
[02:45:37.668 --> 02:45:45.730]  Think about really putting radical Muslims in charge to overthrow every moderate government, and Assad's moderate compared to them, or Egypt's moderate compared.
[02:45:45.730 --> 02:45:46.551]  What is the point?
[02:45:46.551 --> 02:45:54.093]  It's so evil to be backing these people, and so bold, and then you pull back.
[02:45:54.853 --> 02:46:01.656]  Israel has been supporting, in the Golan Heights, some of the Syrian Army, the Free Syrian Army as well.
[02:46:01.656 --> 02:46:05.858]  So even Israel, to a certain extent, has been going along with this.
[02:46:05.858 --> 02:46:07.638]  I mean, how do you square that?
[02:46:07.638 --> 02:46:09.499]  I mean, this is bizarre.
[02:46:09.499 --> 02:46:16.462]  Well, first of all, you can't make deals with radical Islam and have it turn out the way you want it to turn out.
[02:46:16.462 --> 02:46:17.463]  They have their own agenda.
[02:46:17.463 --> 02:46:18.363]  Their own agenda is
[02:46:19.682 --> 02:46:30.487]  Basically a totalitarian political objective to crush everyone, all of the religions, and take over the world for radical Islam and Sharia law.
[02:46:30.487 --> 02:46:43.812]  And what we're going to find, what you're going to see in my article tomorrow, I've just completed it today, is going to be that we rejected the Obama White House and the Hillary Clinton State Department.
[02:46:43.812 --> 02:46:47.354]  You had in Libya, Gaddafi was ready to abdicate.
[02:46:48.064 --> 02:46:51.669]  And the negotiations were going on for him to end it.
[02:46:51.669 --> 02:47:06.088]  And the Obama White House said no, and within days Obama signed an order authorizing the CIA to support and fund and arm the Al Qaeda affiliated militia.
[02:47:06.949 --> 02:47:11.292]  In Libya, knowing that they were Muslim Brotherhood controlled politically.
[02:47:11.292 --> 02:47:13.413]  And you're getting this from high-level military sources.
[02:47:13.413 --> 02:47:16.796]  If you go back to the time, he'd invested billions in France.
[02:47:16.796 --> 02:47:19.157]  The word was he was planning to move to France.
[02:47:19.157 --> 02:47:20.078]  A really smart move.
[02:47:20.078 --> 02:47:21.899]  He let Western governments in.
[02:47:21.899 --> 02:47:29.404]  Their answer was double-crossing, put Al-Qaeda in, and now they admit Libya is a totally failed state and is now a jihad center to invade all of Africa.
[02:47:29.824 --> 02:47:36.090]  And I've been in touch for years with the, you know, the tribal leaders who have left Libya and are trying to get the country back.
[02:47:36.090 --> 02:47:37.231]  They're working out of Egypt.
[02:47:37.231 --> 02:47:39.993]  I've been reporting on them.
[02:47:39.993 --> 02:47:41.895]  Libya has been totally destabilized.
[02:47:41.895 --> 02:47:48.241]  It's been controlled right now by warring militias that are al-Qaeda dominated.
[02:47:48.901 --> 02:47:54.602]  Muslim Brotherhood is in there, the tribes are trying to win back their freedom, they're trying to get their country back.
[02:47:54.602 --> 02:48:02.104]  Let's be clear, the indigenous people are working with Egyptian intelligence to try to kick Al-Qaeda out, and our government's supporting them.
[02:48:02.104 --> 02:48:04.184]  I mean, that is so evil!
[02:48:04.184 --> 02:48:17.907]  So what we're doing, we're supporting the bad guy, we're supporting Al-Qaeda, we are supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, we are arming the Muslim Brotherhood and Al-Qaeda, we're destabilizing all of the Middle East, we're overthrowing stable, maybe evil,
[02:48:18.447 --> 02:48:21.268]  We are Al-Qaeda in the White House and the State Department.
[02:48:44.252 --> 02:48:46.834]  Barack Obama are al-Qaeda in Libya.
[02:48:46.834 --> 02:48:48.336]  How is it going for them?
[02:48:48.336 --> 02:48:50.078]  How is Obama doing?
[02:48:50.078 --> 02:48:52.200]  What do you expect him to pull next?
[02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:53.341]  Well, I think it's a disaster.
[02:48:53.341 --> 02:48:56.564]  I mean, the whole thing is just a complete chaos.
[02:48:56.564 --> 02:49:01.448]  It's just, it's degenerating into a massive chaos.
[02:49:01.448 --> 02:49:02.849]  I'm not sure.
[02:49:02.849 --> 02:49:05.272]  The next things I'm going to be reporting, which I think you're going to find
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:12.208]  I'm also documenting the Muslim Brotherhood and dominance and movement into the U.S.
[02:49:12.208 --> 02:49:12.849]  government.
[02:49:12.849 --> 02:49:15.612]  I mean, at policy levels in the White House.
[02:49:15.612 --> 02:49:17.295]  This is not a small movement.
[02:49:17.295 --> 02:49:20.158]  It has been going on since Obama was elected.
[02:49:20.158 --> 02:49:22.542]  Obama, as I pointed out when I wrote The Obama Nation,
[02:49:23.317 --> 02:49:31.502]  Back in 2008, when Obama first came on the scene, he was affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood and the radical jihadists in Chicago.
[02:49:31.502 --> 02:49:32.682]  This is a revolution.
[02:49:32.682 --> 02:49:34.903]  Open the borders, flood us.
[02:49:34.903 --> 02:49:37.145]  I mean, this is the communist roots.
[02:49:37.145 --> 02:49:39.826]  I just can't believe that the establishment is backing this.
[02:49:39.826 --> 02:49:41.427]  This is extremely dangerous.
[02:49:41.427 --> 02:49:42.688]  If I was a top billionaire...
[02:49:43.248 --> 02:49:44.388]  I mean, I wouldn't want to do this.
[02:49:44.388 --> 02:49:46.649]  This would endanger my wealth, my children.
[02:49:46.649 --> 02:49:53.911]  I mean, this is the leader in control of the West, and they're breaking it because they hate the Renaissance values.
[02:49:53.911 --> 02:49:56.551]  Their totalitarian instincts are insane, Dr. Corsi.
[02:49:56.551 --> 02:49:58.992]  Yeah, they would like the 14th century returned.
[02:49:58.992 --> 02:50:12.175]  And, you know, the information I'm getting now, increasingly, is the group of generals, the admirals, the intelligence people, the former special forces people who are trying to bring to the American people
[02:50:13.425 --> 02:50:24.037]  The duplicity, if not outright treason of the White House and Hillary Clinton in not explaining to the American people that we switched sides in the war on terror and joined the bad guys.
[02:50:24.037 --> 02:50:25.199]  We became Al Qaeda.
[02:50:25.199 --> 02:50:26.020]  Al Qaeda is us.
[02:50:27.927 --> 02:50:28.567]  I get chills.
[02:50:28.567 --> 02:50:33.751]  Dr. Corsi, your report lists all the generals and top people and members of Congress saying this.
[02:50:33.751 --> 02:50:35.152]  The good news is this is coming out.
[02:50:35.152 --> 02:50:38.294]  It's just so hard to believe people have trouble, but it's there.
[02:50:38.294 --> 02:50:43.617]  And we'll talk to you again, hopefully next week, to get us an update when you finish this group of reports.
[02:50:43.617 --> 02:50:44.898]  Amazing journalism.
[02:50:44.898 --> 02:50:46.059]  You deserve the Pulitzer Prize.

[02:51:58.484 --> 02:52:01.326]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:52:01.326 --> 02:52:06.449]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:52:06.449 --> 02:52:14.573]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:52:14.573 --> 02:52:19.096]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:52:19.096 --> 02:52:22.898]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:52:23.058 --> 02:52:29.003]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:52:29.003 --> 02:52:32.185]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:52:32.185 --> 02:52:37.549]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[02:52:37.549 --> 02:52:45.735]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[02:53:31.304 --> 02:53:34.166]  You need Imudine for a healthy immune system.
[02:53:34.166 --> 02:53:37.308]  Why get sick and bother with products that just don't work?

[02:53:53.458 --> 02:53:53.878]  Or call 866-257-8668.
[02:54:06.001 --> 02:54:14.086]  Alright folks, I'll probably do a little bit of overdrive here so we can finish up this report with Anthony Gucciardi because it's so important.
[02:54:14.086 --> 02:54:16.187]  And I just promote and sell what I believe in.
[02:54:16.187 --> 02:54:26.793]  I personally don't take the flu shot, so I then go out and try to boost my immune system and my children's immune system to deal with it and the pneumonia and other viruses under bacteria.
[02:54:26.793 --> 02:54:28.554]  I try to stay out of hospitals.
[02:54:28.554 --> 02:54:30.796]  If I do go to a clinic, I want to go to new clean ones.
[02:54:32.317 --> 02:54:34.518]  So that I don't get, you know, sick from sick people.
[02:54:34.518 --> 02:54:37.480]  This comes from physician's advice, by the way.
[02:54:37.480 --> 02:54:40.342]  Just briefly finishing up the last talk.
[02:54:40.342 --> 02:54:51.970]  The larger geopolitical stratagem of the central banks is to build up radical Islam, turn it loose, let it take over a lot of the world, then battle it on the fringes to consolidate power and take liberties here.
[02:54:51.970 --> 02:54:55.933]  On the fringes of the Islamic radical jihad empire.
[02:54:55.933 --> 02:54:56.914]  That really is happening.
[02:54:57.768 --> 02:54:58.529]  I didn't believe it.
[02:54:58.529 --> 02:54:59.089]  I was wrong.
[02:54:59.089 --> 02:55:00.270]  It's something I didn't foresee.
[02:55:00.270 --> 02:55:03.312]  I couldn't believe the elite were that unstable.
[02:55:03.312 --> 02:55:09.277]  I mean, I knew they would toy with it and build up some groups, but they're really going offensively.
[02:55:09.277 --> 02:55:13.280]  They're going to hold the West hostage with the Stinger missiles, you name it.
[02:55:13.280 --> 02:55:23.168]  Because the globalists couldn't even beat the jihadis they helped create in Iraq and in Pakistan and had drones bombing them that they knew was actually getting them recruits.
[02:55:23.168 --> 02:55:27.331]  They were building up this giant army of resentment to actually give them part of the world.
[02:55:28.977 --> 02:55:32.558]  Just like Hitler and Stalin divided Poland.
[02:55:32.558 --> 02:55:33.979]  Or the Warsaw Pact.
[02:55:33.979 --> 02:55:38.161]  I mean, they are just dividing different parts of the world right now.
[02:55:38.161 --> 02:55:44.043]  And when they're done, there'll be a bunch of new wars, a lot of liberties lost, a lot of veterans with their arms and legs blown off.
[02:55:44.043 --> 02:55:45.423]  Really makes me sick.
[02:55:45.423 --> 02:55:46.564]  But when we came out with
[02:55:47.538 --> 02:55:51.040]  Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Complex.
[02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:58.883]  Again, I said, I want a line of things where, my goodness, we buy such incredibly high quality products, such exotic stuff.
[02:55:58.883 --> 02:56:01.524]  Some of this stuff's high end.
[02:56:01.524 --> 02:56:08.667]  Aren't there a lot of things that are just staples that we can get high quality concentrate and then discount to give people a low cost alternative?
[02:56:09.534 --> 02:56:12.735]  We have this newscast with a nurse.
[02:56:12.735 --> 02:56:16.557]  We'll play a clip saying, oh, the flu shot doesn't help you, but go ahead and get one.
[02:56:16.557 --> 02:56:21.499]  Now, that's admitted from the CDC as well, but this is the cult-like attitude.
[02:56:21.499 --> 02:56:22.780]  It doesn't help you.
[02:56:22.780 --> 02:56:27.082]  In fact, it lowers your immunity and lets you get the regular flu.
[02:56:27.082 --> 02:56:29.543]  Three flu shots doubles your chances of getting Alzheimer's.
[02:56:29.543 --> 02:56:31.203]  That's a major study.
[02:56:31.203 --> 02:56:32.864]  This isn't a game.
[02:56:32.864 --> 02:56:34.505]  Let's go ahead and go to this newscast clip.
[02:56:34.505 --> 02:56:34.865]  Here it is.
[02:56:37.870 --> 02:56:45.476]  ...strain, H3N2, which does not happen to be an exact match to the immunization.
[02:56:45.476 --> 02:56:50.741]  Now having said that, it still is important to get the immunization for a number of reasons.
[02:56:50.741 --> 02:56:52.702]  KOTA.
[02:56:52.702 --> 02:56:58.527]  The immunity that you build from the shot, there is some cross-protection even though it's not an exact match.
[02:56:58.527 --> 02:56:59.208]  That's horse crap!
[02:57:01.550 --> 02:57:07.454]  That's on KOTA News, and so now it's not an exact match, but no, it doesn't help you.
[02:57:07.454 --> 02:57:08.715]  It has to be an exact match.
[02:57:08.715 --> 02:57:10.596]  They've never done it.
[02:57:10.596 --> 02:57:14.679]  It's pure malarkey.
[02:57:14.679 --> 02:57:20.622]  But these nurses are forced to take it, so I guess now she's a virologist, and we've interviewed the virologist and the epidemiologist.
[02:57:20.622 --> 02:57:22.304]  She's going to tell us what to believe.
[02:57:22.304 --> 02:57:24.105]  She looks like she's taken a few herself.
[02:57:25.071 --> 02:57:27.874]  Anthony Gucciardi, tell us about the studies and give us your take on that.
[02:57:27.874 --> 02:57:31.417]  It's funny we were just talking about Al-Qaeda because this ties into it.
[02:57:31.417 --> 02:57:38.023]  We're dealing with a government that armed the Syrian rebels that went around killing Christians, just cutting their heads off in public squares.
[02:57:38.023 --> 02:57:38.704]  Hundreds of thousands.
[02:57:38.704 --> 02:57:41.626]  Screaming, literally bathing in their blood.
[02:57:41.626 --> 02:57:42.107]  Eating hearts.
[02:57:42.267 --> 02:57:52.916]  And Obama, Reuters reported this, was doing it by executive order since 2011 and before that, before they even released it and started justifying it, knowing that these weapons were doing that.
[02:57:52.916 --> 02:57:53.637]  They started the war!
[02:57:53.637 --> 02:58:00.242]  Public squares decapitating 20 plus Christians bathing in their blood on a jihad to kill all of them.
[02:58:00.242 --> 02:58:01.183]  That is what we're supporting.
[02:58:01.183 --> 02:58:07.549]  And then we wonder why our government isn't telling us about natural alternatives for the flu.
[02:58:08.109 --> 02:58:10.811]  We're wondering why they're pushing the vaccine on us.
[02:58:10.811 --> 02:58:15.696]  This government, many elements of it, obviously there's various elements when you go to the low level you're not going to experience.
[02:58:15.696 --> 02:58:16.476]  This government hates us!
[02:58:16.476 --> 02:58:18.919]  Does not care about us and in fact hates us.
[02:58:18.919 --> 02:58:22.161]  So it's up to us to control our own health and to look at these studies.
[02:58:22.161 --> 02:58:28.187]  I mean why would they, you know, push down these studies such as elderberry significantly reduces the duration of infection.
[02:58:28.387 --> 02:58:28.807]  Stay there.
[02:58:28.807 --> 02:58:30.468]  I'm going to give you the floor in the next five-minute segment.
[02:58:30.468 --> 02:58:31.569]  Some stations don't carry it.
[02:58:31.569 --> 02:58:33.450]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:33.450 --> 02:58:35.911]  There'll be a free feed out tonight, 7 o'clock central.

[02:58:56.141 --> 02:58:57.381]  Security alert.
[02:58:57.381 --> 02:58:59.382]  This is Homeland Security.

[02:59:07.963 --> 02:59:08.983]  Prime Directive.
[02:59:08.983 --> 02:59:10.544]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:59:10.544 --> 02:59:13.384]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:59:13.384 --> 02:59:16.625]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:59:16.625 --> 02:59:18.785]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:59:18.985 --> 02:59:20.445]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:59:20.445 --> 02:59:22.626]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:59:22.626 --> 02:59:25.247]  They are never going to stop.
[02:59:25.247 --> 02:59:29.288]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[02:59:39.271 --> 02:59:43.972]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:59:43.972 --> 02:59:45.312]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[02:59:45.312 --> 02:59:46.073]  You can feel it.
[02:59:51.617 --> 02:59:54.300]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:11.454 --> 03:00:12.975]  Fix bayonets.
[03:00:12.975 --> 03:00:15.356]  We are now entering overdrive.

[03:00:25.518 --> 03:00:30.982]  The next 30 minutes or so, we're going to post a link at InfoWars.com for live coverage tonight.
[03:00:30.982 --> 03:00:33.705]  The free audio box feed, so you can send it to friends and family.
[03:00:33.705 --> 03:00:35.706]  We're going to post it to Facebook and more.
[03:00:35.706 --> 03:00:38.408]  7 o'clock central, an hour of live coverage.
[03:00:38.408 --> 03:00:44.613]  We'll be talking over the long applauses, analyzing his lies, going over an hour of analysis after.
[03:00:44.613 --> 03:00:53.921]  And we're going to have an exclusive, anonymous, white hat anonymous, the real deal, exclusive they've sent us will be premiered here tonight, sometime during the nightly news.
[03:00:53.921 --> 03:00:54.602]  So that's coming up.
[03:00:55.529 --> 03:00:58.331]  During the three-hour extended transmission.
[03:00:58.331 --> 03:00:59.911]  Anthony Gucciardi, you got the floor.
[03:00:59.911 --> 03:01:00.832]  Go over these studies.
[03:01:00.832 --> 03:01:04.514]  And yeah, we're here pitching Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Complex.
[03:01:04.514 --> 03:01:08.536]  Discounted Cadillac quality for pent-up prices.
[03:01:08.536 --> 03:01:10.697]  $14.95 introductory price.
[03:01:10.697 --> 03:01:11.618]  This is what I'm taking to...
[03:01:12.338 --> 03:01:17.680]  Get a leg up against all this garbage and haven't gotten sick so far because this stuff in here is all backed by these studies.
[03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:18.641]  Go ahead, Anthony.
[03:01:18.641 --> 03:01:22.262]  We live in a world where natural research is extremely suppressed.
[03:01:22.262 --> 03:01:38.530]  We live in a world where, even though the things I'm referencing, by the way, are from a website, GreenMedInfo, and all they do is take the National Library of Medicine studies from PubMed, the biggest library of medicine in the whole world that doctors reference every single day, they take it and they put it in an easy-to-digest format.
[03:01:38.530 --> 03:01:40.951]  It would take hours and hours and hours and days to actually find this stuff.
[03:01:41.391 --> 03:02:00.296]  So, for example, when we type in some of these ingredients that are in ancient defense, such as elderberry and ginger, we find these amazing studies, such as the fact that elderberry is actually crushing the flu, it's reducing the duration of its infection, it's stopping its infection, it's an effective treatment, they're saying, for influenza A and B. And this isn't us saying this.
[03:02:00.296 --> 03:02:07.158]  This is as far back as 1995 was the study they found that it was a safe and effective treatment for influenza A and B.
[03:02:07.538 --> 03:02:14.764]  It's got echinacea, it's got bayberry bark, it's got elderberry fruit, it's got... I can't even go over all this stuff.
[03:02:14.764 --> 03:02:24.193]  Over 20 different ingredients, including a proprietary blend of different herbs inside of a specific formula where we took a bunch of different extracts and we put it in various doses.
[03:02:24.193 --> 03:02:25.494]  That's the proprietary nature of it.
[03:02:25.754 --> 03:02:28.577]  We didn't patent it because then everyone else would know what to do.
[03:02:28.577 --> 03:02:34.502]  When you patent something, you have to make it available so that others, you know, could take less quality versions of this product.
[03:02:34.502 --> 03:02:41.148]  We just made it proprietary, so it's a secret process that we use to keep it very low cost at $14.95, but also super high quality.
[03:02:41.468 --> 03:02:42.489]  And we looked at all of these.
[03:02:42.489 --> 03:02:43.429]  We looked at this evidence.
[03:02:43.429 --> 03:02:47.432]  I mean, if you look at it, there's 54 pieces of research just for elderberry.
[03:02:47.432 --> 03:02:51.995]  And we're using the top certified organic laboratory factories in the country.
[03:02:51.995 --> 03:02:53.636]  We're going to the biggest, best.
[03:02:53.636 --> 03:02:54.736]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:02:54.736 --> 03:02:58.098]  This comes out of... Because obviously we know we're a target of the FDA and everybody else.
[03:02:58.098 --> 03:02:58.699]  Yes, exactly.
[03:02:58.699 --> 03:03:00.280]  So we go to neurotic levels.
[03:03:00.580 --> 03:03:07.824]  I mean, look, most nutritional, nutraceutical manufacturers would come on here and say a lot more, okay?
[03:03:07.824 --> 03:03:09.125]  They would say the truth.
[03:03:09.125 --> 03:03:11.626]  They would say a lot more, but we know we're an FDA target.
[03:03:11.626 --> 03:03:21.872]  That's why we're just sitting here reading these studies that are coming from PubMed on these ingredients and telling you since 1995 they said that elderberry appears to be a safe and effective treatment for influenza A and B.
[03:03:22.506 --> 03:03:23.427]  We're not making any claims.
[03:03:23.427 --> 03:03:25.008]  We're saying this is what the studies say.
[03:03:25.008 --> 03:03:26.389]  What kind of freedom do we have in this country?
[03:03:26.389 --> 03:03:29.231]  We're simply here saying the flu shot doesn't work.
[03:03:29.231 --> 03:03:30.111]  They admit it.
[03:03:30.111 --> 03:03:32.233]  Here's what the studies admit helps you.
[03:03:32.233 --> 03:03:32.773]  Exactly.
[03:03:32.773 --> 03:03:40.678]  It's like we can't even say this anymore that the flu shot doesn't work and elderberry is being suppressed completely when there's studies showing that it actually suppresses the flu.
[03:03:40.678 --> 03:03:50.705]  And of course, in a real rational world, we wouldn't arm al-Qaeda and we would fund research about how a natural plant... Well, when you go to the pediatrician now, they do say get elderberry this winter.
[03:03:50.805 --> 03:03:52.567]  I mean, the good news is medical doctors are.
[03:03:52.567 --> 03:03:54.408]  That's because those doctors are usually good people.
[03:03:54.408 --> 03:03:59.112]  We both know a bunch of doctors, you know, on a friendship level and they say, hey, we're starting to realize this.
[03:03:59.112 --> 03:04:00.513]  Such as the microbiome.
[03:04:00.513 --> 03:04:09.541]  If your immune system produces the right hormone-related chemicals, you can pretty much stop any virus from getting in your body.
[03:04:09.541 --> 03:04:11.643]  But what happens is the lectins that you make.
[03:04:11.963 --> 03:04:24.213]  But what happens is your immune system and your microbiome, which is your biotic dome, essentially your gut, your bacteria, your good and bad bacteria, if that gets out of whack, your immune system gets out of whack, you're susceptible to anything.
[03:04:24.213 --> 03:04:29.477]  You know what, I want to apologize today for getting you on and then I had Corsi on and played those reports.
[03:04:30.558 --> 03:04:34.060]  Can you come on for like 30 minutes tomorrow and have the floor and really just walk through all this?
[03:04:34.060 --> 03:04:34.481]  Yeah, for sure.
[03:04:34.481 --> 03:04:35.101]  From start to finish.
[03:04:35.101 --> 03:04:37.863]  I know you had a whole presentation and, you know, breaks and everything else.
[03:04:37.863 --> 03:04:40.965]  I mean, a lot of good info came out, but I want you to really go over it all.
[03:04:40.965 --> 03:04:42.746]  Infowarslife.com.
