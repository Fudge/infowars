[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.101]  It's never going to get any better.
[00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:29.222]  Don't look for it.
[00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:30.783]  Be happy with what you got.
[00:00:31.923 --> 00:00:34.985]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[00:00:35.546 --> 00:00:37.207]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[00:00:37.587 --> 00:00:38.648]  The real owners.
[00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:43.231]  The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[00:00:43.631 --> 00:00:44.852]  Forget the politicians.
[00:00:45.072 --> 00:00:48.354]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:50.356]  You don't.
[00:00:51.156 --> 00:00:52.117]  You have no choice.
[00:00:52.517 --> 00:00:53.438]  You have owners.
[00:00:53.738 --> 00:00:54.659]  They own you.
[00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:57.303]  They own everything.
[00:00:57.523 --> 00:00:59.165]  They own all the important land.
[00:00:59.545 --> 00:01:01.287]  They own and control the corporations.
[00:01:01.307 --> 00:01:04.790]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.
[00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.391]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:11.535]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:13.337]  They got you by the balls!
[00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:16.943]  They want obedient workers.
[00:01:17.383 --> 00:01:18.884]  Obedient workers.
[00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:31.895]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[00:01:31.975 --> 00:01:35.217]  And now, they're coming for your social security money.
[00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:38.320]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:40.642]  It's a big club.
[00:01:41.644 --> 00:01:42.464]  And you ain't in it.
[00:01:43.045 --> 00:01:45.746]  You and I are not in the big club.
[00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:48.067]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[00:01:48.727 --> 00:01:52.429]  It's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.370]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.212]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[00:01:59.232 --> 00:02:03.154]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[00:02:03.174 --> 00:02:04.134]  They're not interested in that.
[00:02:04.394 --> 00:02:05.335]  That doesn't help them.
[00:02:05.715 --> 00:02:07.095]  That's against their interest.
[00:02:07.596 --> 00:02:08.036]  That's right.
[00:02:27.082 --> 00:02:29.103]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:29.163 --> 00:02:31.984]  This is a live broadcast on this Tuesday, December 15, 2015.
[00:02:33.044 --> 00:02:33.944]  I'm David Knight.
[00:02:33.984 --> 00:02:36.605]  Joining me are Leanne McAdoo and Jakari Jackson.
[00:02:37.026 --> 00:02:41.687]  We're going to be covering the GOP debate out of Las Vegas tonight with our commentary.
[00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:53.271]  That's going to be coming up in about a half hour, but before we do, I want to get Leanne and Jakari's comments on what we just saw with George Carlin, because there was a lot of truth packed into that.
[00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:54.111]  I love that intro.
[00:02:54.252 --> 00:02:55.252]  It's a very good intro.
[00:02:55.612 --> 00:02:57.493]  You know, he's talking about who the real owners are.
[00:02:57.613 --> 00:02:58.914]  We're seeing this over and over again.
[00:02:59.434 --> 00:03:06.999]  We're seeing the real owners of this country, when they put together a trade package, they call themselves the stakeholders.
[00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:12.723]  They put together this trade package and they don't show it to even the people that we've supposedly elected.
[00:03:13.143 --> 00:03:14.063]  They're not allowed to look at it.
[00:03:14.083 --> 00:03:15.424]  They're not allowed to talk about it.
[00:03:15.484 --> 00:03:16.944]  We're not allowed to look at it for years.
[00:03:17.605 --> 00:03:19.265]  And then they're going to run this thing through.
[00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:24.707]  Once they get it run through, they'll be able to change it at will without any further input from us or any oversight from us.
[00:03:24.928 --> 00:03:26.828]  We just saw the same thing happen with the climate treaty.
[00:03:27.188 --> 00:03:36.152]  So these people who are in the club that we're not in, the stakeholders of America, they're the ones who are going to be, we're going to be watching and talking about tonight.
[00:03:36.192 --> 00:03:41.294]  And of course, this debate that we're going to be watching tonight is going to be coming from Sheldon Adelson's house.
[00:03:41.994 --> 00:03:42.894]  Sheldon Adelson's house.
[00:03:43.755 --> 00:03:45.936]  The Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas.
[00:03:45.996 --> 00:03:50.117]  Sheldon Adelson, this gigantic Republican donor.
[00:03:50.538 --> 00:03:55.860]  And just to put in perspective the amount of money that he gave last time, he gave $98 million to Republicans in the 2012 election.
[00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:13.622]  To put that in perspective, in 2012, I'm looking at the Federal Election Commission figures here, George Bush spent way more, way more than anybody else, any of his Republican rivals, way more than Al Gore in terms of winning the primary.
[00:04:13.662 --> 00:04:14.564]  He spent $91 million that year.
[00:04:16.286 --> 00:04:25.010]  Now, his rival, his chief rival, John McCain, including federal matching funds, got $45 million.
[00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.331]  So, yeah, let's turn that a little bit so you can see that.
[00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:29.151]  Which way?
[00:04:29.331 --> 00:04:30.632]  Yeah, this way a little bit better.
[00:04:30.712 --> 00:04:30.952]  Okay.
[00:04:31.192 --> 00:04:37.515]  So, basically, McCain got about, even with federal matching funds, he got half the amount of money that
[00:04:38.795 --> 00:04:42.858]  That George Bush had, and it was about half that amount of money with matching funds that Al Gore had.
[00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:52.506]  And yet, that amount of money, which was way more than anybody had to win the primary, was what one guy spent, Sheldon Adelson, and of course this is going to be at his casino.
[00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:52.906]  Right.
[00:04:52.946 --> 00:04:53.947]  You know, his house rules.
[00:04:54.107 --> 00:04:55.869]  That's the club, and we're not in it.
[00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:58.832]  And, you know, George Carlin, he hit the nail on the head.
[00:04:58.892 --> 00:05:10.746]  He's one person I would love to be able to keep his brain in a jar, because we need that type of... That's the real humor, and that's why they don't want you to, you know, watch comedy and things like that, because they can push across that humor.
[00:05:11.366 --> 00:05:14.147]  Well, they don't want you, he pointed out, they don't want you thinking independently.
[00:05:14.167 --> 00:05:14.327]  Right.
[00:05:14.607 --> 00:05:18.528]  And they don't want you acting independent of their showboat elections.
[00:05:18.588 --> 00:05:32.532]  They don't want you acting at the state or local level or at your jury level, where you can shut down with just one person out of twelve, you can shut down invalid, out of line prosecutions with just one person in the jury.
[00:05:32.572 --> 00:05:36.393]  And that's for out of control state, federal or local laws.
[00:05:36.413 --> 00:05:37.393]  You can shut it down to that point.
[00:05:37.413 --> 00:05:39.174]  It's one of the most valuable tools that we have.
[00:05:39.534 --> 00:05:42.176]  But they do every trick that they can to shut that down.
[00:05:42.276 --> 00:05:44.637]  Lying to people about what it's about.
[00:05:44.818 --> 00:05:47.920]  The judges giving instructions that are flat out lies.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.100]  Punishing people.
[00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:50.601]  Punishing lawyers if they talk about it.
[00:05:50.882 --> 00:05:52.703]  The same way they manipulate the electoral system.
[00:06:09.414 --> 00:06:11.335]  That's right, he wasn't part of the club.
[00:06:11.475 --> 00:06:19.519]  Even though he had been a two-term Republican governor in a Democrat state, he had been re-elected by a much larger margin the second time.
[00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:28.043]  So a very popular Republican governor in a Democrat state, two-term governor, and they said, well, you don't match the numbers that we need in the polls, but they didn't put him in the polls.
[00:06:28.383 --> 00:06:41.450]  They can play those kinds of games, and then when he got out and ran as a Libertarian, they said, well, okay, you jumped through all the hoops to get on the ballot in 50 states, but we still don't think you're a serious candidate, so we're not going to allow you to participate in the debates nevertheless.
[00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.232]  So, they arbitrarily decide who they're going to let into their club, and who they're not.
[00:06:45.692 --> 00:06:54.923]  And I think, quite frankly, one of the problems that they have with Donald Trump is that he has basically pushed his way into the club without their permission because he's got enough money to do that.
[00:06:55.063 --> 00:06:59.668]  Right, and that's kind of the thing is that he hasn't spent maybe just a couple hundred thousand dollars on
[00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:01.370]  I think so.
[00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:26.512]  Well, Trump has been able to use the media, and Jeb Bush, who, when he began running, he instantly went well over $100 million in terms of contributions to Super PAC funds.
[00:07:26.853 --> 00:07:35.795]  He has blown through about half of that, and he continues to decline in the polls in spite of that, because, number one, he's not selling anything that anybody wants.
[00:07:35.875 --> 00:07:36.855]  We've seen it before.
[00:07:37.035 --> 00:07:39.456]  It's old, recycled stuff, and it is 180 degrees.
[00:07:40.896 --> 00:07:45.238]  Diametrically opposed to what his Republican base wants to see, so it's not good.
[00:07:45.258 --> 00:07:46.459]  Nobody wants another Bush.
[00:07:46.619 --> 00:07:46.939]  That's right.
[00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:53.742]  You know, they're trying to convince people that they want another Clinton and having varying degrees of success at it, but nobody wants another Bush.
[00:07:53.982 --> 00:07:54.422]  That's right.
[00:07:54.763 --> 00:08:07.108]  Now, going back to Sheldon Maddison, as I pointed out, he has a tremendous amount of influence, giving as much in the last election cycle as Bush had spent in total, more than Bush had spent in total in 2000.
[00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:16.675]  And it looks like, as I talk about, they have the Sheldon Adelson primary, and it was reported that Marco Rubio had won that primary.
[00:08:17.235 --> 00:08:23.559]  They had most of the candidates, Rand Paul didn't go, Donald Trump didn't go, to kiss the ring of Sheldon Adelson.
[00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:24.499]  I think so.
[00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:52.472]  People need to pay attention to this because his central focus on who he gives money to is how strongly they're going to support Israel.
[00:08:52.612 --> 00:08:59.073]  Either that or if they're going to do certain things for him for his gaming licenses like Lindsey Graham did.
[00:08:59.113 --> 00:09:06.495]  Lindsey Graham pushed a bill to prohibit online gambling and he had just gotten a large contribution from Sheldon Adelson.
[00:09:06.975 --> 00:09:07.755]  Just coincidental.
[00:09:07.835 --> 00:09:08.315]  Right, yeah.
[00:09:08.875 --> 00:09:16.000]  Well, so why do you think there's such a witch hunt out for donors like the Koch Brothers or something, but you don't really see that with Sheldon Adelson?
[00:09:16.221 --> 00:09:17.061]  Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:09:17.181 --> 00:09:17.702]  It's interesting.
[00:09:18.242 --> 00:09:19.683]  And I don't know.
[00:09:19.703 --> 00:09:24.427]  I think it's because the Koch Brothers have been associated with the Keystone Pipeline.
[00:09:24.847 --> 00:09:26.629]  With some other things, I don't really know.
[00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:31.753]  Certainly, Sheldon Adelson's focus is much narrower.
[00:09:32.073 --> 00:09:35.276]  It's things that are in his particular interest and in the interest of Israel.
[00:09:35.616 --> 00:09:36.777]  And that's how he focuses.
[00:09:37.098 --> 00:09:41.762]  And so his two candidates that he's looking at right now are Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.
[00:09:41.862 --> 00:09:43.183]  That should tell us something about them.
[00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:47.066]  And we're watching this junior varsity debate that we've been looking at.
[00:09:47.547 --> 00:09:51.250]  To me, everything that we were seeing was revolving around war.
[00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:51.930]  Right.
[00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.011]  When will you go to war?
[00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:54.052]  How deep will you go to war?
[00:09:54.092 --> 00:09:55.573]  Will you send women into war?
[00:09:55.653 --> 00:09:56.394]  War, war, war.
[00:09:56.514 --> 00:09:59.456]  I am so sick of this from the Republican candidates.
[00:09:59.556 --> 00:10:14.167]  And the elephant in the GOP debate is the fact that ISIS, the big boogeyman, of course we all know and we've been saying this over and over again and we need to do a split screen when these guys start pontificating about how we need to get involved and send troops to Syria and everything.
[00:10:14.187 --> 00:10:16.048]  We need to put that screen up there and say, look,
[00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:20.852]  Just today, we found more evidence of social media being run out of our ally, Britain.
[00:10:21.212 --> 00:10:26.937]  We know that the Turkish, our ally in NATO, is giving them all kinds of weapon equipment and buying their oil.
[00:10:27.337 --> 00:10:28.618]  This is total baloney.
[00:10:28.838 --> 00:10:29.038]  Right.
[00:10:29.098 --> 00:10:35.283]  Well, wasn't it General Wesley Clark who came out years ago and said that he had overheard a conversation where it was going to be, you know...
[00:10:35.523 --> 00:10:39.505]  Yes, they had the countries they were going to take down and the order they were going to take them down.
[00:10:39.545 --> 00:10:44.568]  He was just on Fox News Monday, I guess, speaking about going into Syria and everything.
[00:10:44.888 --> 00:11:01.958]  I was just watching it going, how is he just out there parading for this when he knows that this was part of the plan and he was the one that actually came out and said it, that this was a plan that we were going to take down these countries and now he's out there trying to let the American people know that, oh well, just randomly we need to take Syria down.
[00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:09.423]  Because it used to, with the broadcast news, they would be able to just ignore what somebody said or not show it again.
[00:11:09.463 --> 00:11:16.969]  But with the internet, people can go back if they're interested, if they care enough to know what's going on, they can go back and they can look at what these people have said.
[00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:18.911]  But unfortunately, most people don't really care.
[00:11:22.873 --> 00:11:24.635]  If you want your plan, you can keep your plan.
[00:11:24.695 --> 00:11:25.655]  I didn't say that.
[00:11:25.675 --> 00:11:28.898]  Then they made entire montages of it.
[00:11:29.118 --> 00:11:32.861]  So yeah, they can go back and look at it, but the politicians still find ways to weasel out of it.
[00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:38.925]  I actually just tweeted out the video with Bush telling everyone, you know, in 2001, well, why do they hate us?
[00:11:39.025 --> 00:11:40.366]  Oh, they hate us for our freedoms.
[00:11:40.406 --> 00:11:41.687]  They hate us for everything we've got here.
[00:11:41.727 --> 00:11:44.369]  And then now we're seeing the same thing again with ISIS.
[00:11:44.749 --> 00:11:46.050]  This was a story out of slate.
[00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.913]  ISIS gives us no choice but to consider limits on speech.
[00:11:50.273 --> 00:11:50.473]  Yeah.
[00:11:50.493 --> 00:11:51.853]  And so we're seeing this again and again.
[00:11:51.913 --> 00:11:55.734]  We need to... Well, if they hate us for our freedoms, they don't have much to hate us for anymore.
[00:11:55.755 --> 00:11:58.455]  Yeah, they must like us a lot better now.
[00:11:58.475 --> 00:12:04.237]  15 years on, we're looking real good to them because we're looking a lot like the country that they were living in.
[00:12:04.897 --> 00:12:09.018]  As I'm looking at Ben Carson, and, you know, he's having problems in the polls.
[00:12:09.058 --> 00:12:19.041]  He's been slipping in the polls after he developed some credibility issues, looked really out of touch in terms of foreign policy because, you know, according to the mainstream press,
[00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:28.003]  The American president is supposed to be ruler of the world, so they need to know every little group and every little corner of the world and who they're going to fight and who they're going to support.
[00:12:29.043 --> 00:12:30.164]  We need to get over that idea.
[00:12:30.204 --> 00:12:33.204]  We need to have a peace and freedom candidate.
[00:12:33.224 --> 00:12:35.965]  Wouldn't that be nice if we had somebody talking about peace and freedom?
[00:12:35.985 --> 00:12:39.546]  But no, they're all talking about how they can wage war better than the next guy.
[00:12:40.046 --> 00:12:45.329]  So, along that line, you see that Ben Carson today says he's going to declare war against ISIS.
[00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:52.114]  He says he wants to investigate the Council on American-Islamic Relations, care for their ties to terrorism.
[00:12:52.194 --> 00:12:55.996]  So, you know, it's absolutely amazing.
[00:12:56.536 --> 00:12:57.117]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:12:57.157 --> 00:12:58.638]  Yeah, well, they're definitely setting us up to...
[00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:01.019]  Vote in a wartime president, so.
[00:13:01.199 --> 00:13:03.560]  And I believe we have Richard Reeves online.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.421]  Yeah, Richard Reeves, yeah.
[00:13:04.681 --> 00:13:05.461]  Let's go to Richard Reeves.
[00:13:05.501 --> 00:13:06.482]  He's in Las Vegas.
[00:13:06.522 --> 00:13:07.062]  Go ahead, Richard.
[00:13:07.242 --> 00:13:08.723]  Thank you, David.
[00:13:09.003 --> 00:13:11.964]  Richard Reeves here for Infowars.com, and shout out to Alex.
[00:13:12.085 --> 00:13:22.390]  I've been out here just a very few short minutes and already met some of Alex Jones supporters, despite the fact that not that many listeners and viewers even recognize my face at this point.
[00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:26.691]  It's really exciting to see that the Infowars movement is just growing and growing.
[00:13:27.132 --> 00:13:30.453]  The city obviously is abuzz with the GOP debate.
[00:13:30.773 --> 00:13:32.533]  They are doing security theater here.
[00:13:32.573 --> 00:13:35.014]  It's not probably as bad as Popeville was.
[00:13:35.034 --> 00:13:39.756]  Oh yeah, when we went to Philadelphia, that was ridiculous.
[00:13:39.776 --> 00:13:41.777]  You didn't have to walk for two hours carrying your luggage?
[00:13:45.381 --> 00:13:52.330]  You know, since I kind of recalled that story, I thought, you know what, there's plenty of rooms available, they were cheap here at the Venetian, so I just thought, you know, I better just stay here.
[00:13:52.350 --> 00:14:00.901]  And it's a good thing, because traffic getting in and out of here right now, even prior to the debate, oh absolutely, prior to the debate was a big deal, just trying to get in.
[00:14:01.381 --> 00:14:04.304]  And like I say, they do have a security theater, they are looking at people's trunks.
[00:14:05.045 --> 00:14:05.726]  Oh wow.
[00:14:05.746 --> 00:14:13.394]  But hopefully, hopefully before, whenever you're ready to sign me out and go on to the next interview or next person.
[00:14:13.754 --> 00:14:15.756]  Hey Richard, have they looked in your trunk yet?
[00:14:17.743 --> 00:14:22.966]  Now Richard, when they were looking in your trunk, was that when you were pulling into the hotel or was that just someplace around town?
[00:14:44.454 --> 00:14:47.376]  No, this is when I was trying to pull into the self-parking at the hotel.
[00:14:48.197 --> 00:14:53.100]  I went to a Rand Paul event earlier today around lunchtime and did some upload videos.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:15:02.167]  Anyway, came back to the hotel and thankfully it was coming back plenty early because it did take probably an extra 20-30 minutes to get back into the self-parking here at the hotel.
[00:15:02.447 --> 00:15:03.868]  What can you tell us about the Rand Paul event?
[00:15:03.908 --> 00:15:04.649]  How was it attended?
[00:15:04.689 --> 00:15:05.730]  Was there very many people there?
[00:15:06.624 --> 00:15:08.685]  Well, it was standing room only.
[00:15:09.025 --> 00:15:10.125]  The room was a little small.
[00:15:10.185 --> 00:15:11.626]  It was about 100 people, maybe.
[00:15:12.066 --> 00:15:14.327]  Standing room only, and there was quite a bit of press there.
[00:15:14.347 --> 00:15:27.632]  A lot of excitement, and if you saw that YouTube earlier, we may see some real fireworks coming up in this debate tonight with Rand Paul saying that Donald Trump would be not too good, according to Rand Paul.
[00:15:27.833 --> 00:15:36.396]  Yeah, we've got a couple of clips saying that it's time to attack Donald Trump, so we're going to play some of those clips.
[00:15:37.737 --> 00:15:43.221]  I'd like to see Rand Paul hit the barbed wire, but how about all the issues?
[00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:46.583]  Have some passion about all these issues that we fight about.
[00:15:47.043 --> 00:15:49.184]  To me, in my book, Donald Trump should be an ally.
[00:15:49.244 --> 00:15:59.550]  We should be seeing a tag team or three-way, four-way match of wrestlers here, political wrestlers, fighting for the Constitution.
[00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:05.734]  We should see Donald Trump in that regard more, and we have in the past, especially on the border issues, been good.
[00:16:06.295 --> 00:16:06.656]  I don't know.
[00:16:19.673 --> 00:16:24.295]  You know, being friends with Rand Paul I think is key, and vice versa, Rand Paul being friends with the President.
[00:16:24.335 --> 00:16:25.035]  This is important.
[00:16:25.335 --> 00:16:26.416]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:16:27.056 --> 00:16:29.717]  Now you're there at the Venetian where the debate is going to be held.
[00:16:30.117 --> 00:16:34.099]  What kind of things have they done in terms of selecting the audience?
[00:16:34.139 --> 00:16:40.121]  Because I know in the past they have had very small, very hand-picked audiences for these debates.
[00:16:41.121 --> 00:16:42.202]  It's very hand-picked.
[00:16:42.262 --> 00:16:44.803]  It's fine-tooth combed probably because
[00:16:45.536 --> 00:16:49.577]  My understanding is there's only a thousand people seated at the venue, maybe 1,100.
[00:16:50.617 --> 00:17:00.139]  And I was on a website earlier seeing, okay, you know, chances of me getting into the actual debate and getting in, plus my footage wouldn't be near as good as what you can get on the broadcast for the big stations.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.961]  But I thought, you know what, let me just see if I did try to get in, what kind of luck I would have.
[00:17:05.001 --> 00:17:09.782]  So I actually went searching around on the web last night when I got in real late, three or four o'clock in the morning.
[00:17:11.811 --> 00:17:15.233]  Even the Nevada GOP says, hey, we're not even sure how to get tickets.
[00:17:15.753 --> 00:17:21.595]  So the state guys got pretty much kind of stomped on by the national RNC.
[00:17:21.735 --> 00:17:24.136]  All right, well, thank you so much, Richard.
[00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:26.177]  We actually have a clip of Rand Paul.
[00:17:26.197 --> 00:17:28.558]  You've been talking about that event out there.
[00:17:28.598 --> 00:17:30.019]  So we'll go to this clip of Rand Paul.
[00:17:30.039 --> 00:17:30.799]  Then we're going to come back.
[00:17:30.839 --> 00:17:32.980]  I believe we have Alex Jones waiting in the wings.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.742]  So Richard, we'll definitely keep in contact with you and come back when you have some updates.
[00:17:37.762 --> 00:17:39.863]  But let's go ahead and take a look at that clip from Rand Paul.
[00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:45.655]  Senator, before the first debate, you promised to mix things up and you went pretty hard after Trump.
[00:17:46.155 --> 00:17:49.338]  Can we expect to see a similar strategy tonight?
[00:17:49.358 --> 00:17:50.639]  You've gone after Rubio repeatedly.
[00:17:50.659 --> 00:17:53.442]  Are we going to see something like that again tonight?
[00:17:53.582 --> 00:17:56.425]  It might be time to go after Trump again.
[00:17:56.825 --> 00:17:59.768]  People have not yet figured out that he would be a disaster.
[00:18:00.128 --> 00:18:00.408]  I think so.
[00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:31.213]  And I think as you've seen with Ben Carson dropping 20 points, same can happen to Donald Trump and not soon enough for me.
[00:18:32.814 --> 00:18:33.655]  Well, there you hear it.
[00:18:33.675 --> 00:18:37.977]  He said that he thought that a Trump presidency would be a disaster for the country.
[00:18:38.437 --> 00:18:44.140]  Clearly Trump is right on a lot of issues and he has spoken out on issues that other people would not speak out on.
[00:18:44.521 --> 00:18:50.804]  I'm concerned about some of the things that he says he's going to do, you know, because we've always got politicians who are willing to lie to you about issues.
[00:18:51.184 --> 00:18:53.246]  But there's also things they're willing to tell you the truth about.
[00:18:53.306 --> 00:19:01.892]  If they tell you that they're going to raise your taxes, or they're going to send you to war, or they're going to take your freedoms, you better pay attention to them because they will follow up on those promises.
[00:19:01.952 --> 00:19:12.920]  And I'd like to see Rand Paul get really passionate, but not about the kinds of things like he did in the very first debate where he says, you know, he got so angry about Donald Trump thinking that he might not run as a Republican.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:13.921]  I don't really care!
[00:19:14.241 --> 00:19:16.783]  If somebody runs as a Republican or a Democrat or as a Libertarian.
[00:19:17.023 --> 00:19:17.923]  I really don't care about that.
[00:19:18.203 --> 00:19:19.604]  I care about liberty.
[00:19:20.024 --> 00:19:22.406]  And that's what we need to get passionate and angry about.
[00:19:22.446 --> 00:19:24.727]  And that's what Rand Paul needs to get passionate about.
[00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:28.590]  And I'd like to see somebody question Trump on the no-fly, no-buy list.
[00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:28.850]  Yes.
[00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.972]  I'd also like to see, you know, all the surveillance that he's pushing.
[00:19:31.992 --> 00:19:37.635]  This would really be a chance, you know, if you want to make a name for yourself, you can come out and just question him on these issues.
[00:19:37.875 --> 00:19:40.758]  Yeah, you don't have to be a jerk about it, but that's what I like about Rand Paul.
[00:19:40.778 --> 00:19:51.827]  He's so good about sticking it to them with those constitutional values and being able to call people out because most of the people on stage, like you said, they're not going to be champions for the Constitution.
[00:19:51.887 --> 00:19:54.009]  They're going to be more power to the state.
[00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:54.370]  Yeah.
[00:19:55.411 --> 00:19:57.713]  He does a great job when he does that with Chris Christie.
[00:19:57.753 --> 00:19:58.894]  We've got Alex on the line.
[00:19:58.934 --> 00:20:00.595]  Let's get Alex's take on this.
[00:20:01.236 --> 00:20:01.396]  Alex.
[00:20:02.363 --> 00:20:07.946]  Joining you via Skype video feed and Facebook mentions from my home in Austin, Texas.
[00:20:07.966 --> 00:20:11.588]  I want to just make a few points out, wider than these candidates, wider than the debate.
[00:20:12.068 --> 00:20:29.877]  We're seeing true 21st century media right now, where we've got a modern media system in downtown Austin, and I'm here at my home watching the establishment media and their analysis, integrating it with you, the listeners, the Twitter feeds, the Facebook comments, and so much more.
[00:20:29.897 --> 00:20:30.778]  And that's what this is all about.
[00:20:31.058 --> 00:20:32.420]  We're teleprompter free.
[00:20:32.981 --> 00:20:39.570]  We're the only major network that's actually covering the CNN propaganda itself and the men behind the curtain, the women behind the curtain.
[00:20:40.595 --> 00:20:44.158]  And we're also analyzing the way the media is changing.
[00:20:44.599 --> 00:20:52.747]  Because if we can have millions of viewers tonight, which we will in the aggregate, and CNN normally only has about a half million viewers, they'll have about 30, 40 million tonight.
[00:20:53.047 --> 00:20:55.670]  That's why they're wearing their fanciest ties and they're all excited.
[00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.532]  This is when dinosaur media gets to act like it's big again.
[00:20:58.913 --> 00:21:02.857]  This is when it can remember 10, 20, 30 years ago when it was totally dominant.
[00:21:03.657 --> 00:21:04.538]  Not the joke it is.
[00:21:04.578 --> 00:21:06.760]  The average MSNBC show, about 300,000 viewers.
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.123]  The average CNN, half a million.
[00:21:09.383 --> 00:21:15.189]  Fox is still king with about 2 million average for their primetime shows during the day.
[00:21:15.209 --> 00:21:17.071]  It was 4 or 5 million just a decade ago.
[00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:19.471]  We're rising, they're falling.
[00:21:19.531 --> 00:21:21.311]  It's not about InfoWars keeping score.
[00:21:21.431 --> 00:21:28.794]  We're true hardcore Americana patriots, true classical liberals like Thomas Jefferson trying to bring real freedom back.
[00:21:29.335 --> 00:21:35.157]  And that's why all their demonization, all the thousands of articles a month lying about us isn't working.
[00:21:35.557 --> 00:21:37.038]  And the reason I'm here from home tonight
[00:21:37.978 --> 00:21:45.446]  Because I want the image to the viewers and the listeners and all the radio stations that have called me wanting to carry this feed tonight from Albuquerque to New York City.
[00:21:45.486 --> 00:21:46.187]  It's very exciting.
[00:21:46.207 --> 00:21:51.813]  Somebody had told you guys a lot of radio stations themselves are picking this up, not just TV stations or viewers on the web.
[00:21:53.138 --> 00:21:56.180]  Is that this is the end of the mainstream media.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.341]  This is the beginning of the end of these people.
[00:21:58.442 --> 00:22:06.407]  And as I've been saying for six months, Rand Paul's dream, and I've known him for 20 years, I like him, he's a great guy, but he listens to advisors that don't know what they're talking about.
[00:22:06.427 --> 00:22:11.350]  His dream, you know, has been, oh, Trump will suddenly just fizzle.
[00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:13.351]  Well, that's what Jeb Bush has been saying for six months.
[00:22:13.972 --> 00:22:16.233]  And he's not Ben Carson with all these made up stories.
[00:22:17.094 --> 00:22:20.136]  So, so, so Rand Paul's been taken from the lead six months ago.
[00:22:20.856 --> 00:22:21.116]  I don't know.
[00:22:42.725 --> 00:22:52.254]  It is a suicidal political move at this point to, without knowing all the facts, when Trump's the champion of so many good issues, whether he's real or not, he's now taking on that mantle.
[00:22:53.115 --> 00:22:57.699]  If we sit here and just try to shoot him down without proof, we're going to be going down.
[00:22:57.959 --> 00:22:59.100]  Hillary and Bernie.
[00:23:00.121 --> 00:23:01.562]  And Jeb Bush are the enemies.
[00:23:01.782 --> 00:23:04.524]  They're the real bona fide evil riders.
[00:23:05.124 --> 00:23:07.866]  The enemies are the people that have to be dealt with.
[00:23:08.246 --> 00:23:11.488]  If Trump tries to go back on us, we'll take him down like John Boehner.
[00:23:11.929 --> 00:23:15.211]  If Rand Paul tries to sell us out, which I'm not saying he'd do, we'll go after him.
[00:23:15.451 --> 00:23:16.351]  Same thing with Ted Cruz.
[00:23:16.391 --> 00:23:20.374]  But we know in their voting record, Senator Cruz and Rand Paul
[00:23:20.914 --> 00:23:24.156]  Are both very credible, serious people that I really respect.
[00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:28.139]  Trump has the dynamic charisma it takes.
[00:23:28.179 --> 00:23:29.000]  He's taken on the mantle.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.621]  I've talked to folks behind the scenes.
[00:23:30.641 --> 00:23:31.382]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:23:31.762 --> 00:23:33.443]  Trump is dialed into what's going on.
[00:23:33.984 --> 00:23:35.425]  Or he's the biggest liar in the world.
[00:23:35.645 --> 00:23:37.166]  The stuff that's been basically relayed to me.
[00:23:37.646 --> 00:23:46.213]  So, look, you don't normally have frontrunner presidential candidates in a key election like this talking to Alex Jones, you know, off air and stuff like that.
[00:23:46.593 --> 00:23:50.137]  So what we're talking about here is really big.
[00:23:50.778 --> 00:23:54.582]  And so are we gambling on Trump, Cruz or Paul?
[00:23:54.902 --> 00:23:55.422]  Absolutely.
[00:23:55.543 --> 00:24:04.112]  But we're not gambling when we sit here and just eat each other up and kill each other over who's the best, you know, in the Republicans, but ignore the Democrats.
[00:24:04.272 --> 00:24:04.712]  Here's the deal.
[00:24:05.493 --> 00:24:07.295]  The Democrats have total power right now.
[00:24:07.655 --> 00:24:09.036]  They blackmail the Supreme Court.
[00:24:09.316 --> 00:24:10.417]  They've got the presidency.
[00:24:10.457 --> 00:24:11.558]  They're ramming everything through.
[00:24:11.598 --> 00:24:22.207]  They've got control of most Republican leadership that have circled the wagons against the Tea Party and are trying to annihilate it, what Ron Paul's father and us and others, you the viewers and listeners, created.
[00:24:22.627 --> 00:24:28.331]  So that's the battle right now is over the heart and soul and over the rhetoric, over the content, over the issues.
[00:24:28.732 --> 00:24:33.836]  And I'm sorry, Trump wins so far for carrying the ball for basic libertarian ideas.
[00:24:34.096 --> 00:24:37.410]  He said some other things that are quite frankly draconian, that I think are dangerous.
[00:24:38.562 --> 00:24:44.404]  You separate that, though, from the other candidates he's up against, you gotta get him in the benefit of the doubt, because he's changed positions many times.
[00:24:44.424 --> 00:24:47.285]  Like saying he was for refugees three months ago, and then we criticize it.
[00:24:47.305 --> 00:24:48.326]  He said, OK, I'm against it.
[00:24:48.586 --> 00:24:49.626]  Now I see the terror threat.
[00:24:49.886 --> 00:24:51.327]  They're taking things out of context.
[00:24:51.367 --> 00:24:54.208]  They're demonizing because they're scared.
[00:24:54.608 --> 00:24:55.948]  So that's what this comes down to.
[00:24:56.108 --> 00:24:58.209]  And Rand Paul shouldn't be hoping and waiting.
[00:24:58.929 --> 00:25:05.292]  The very same mainstream media that demonized him, that attacked him, that lied about him in his Kentucky senatorial campaign,
[00:25:06.332 --> 00:25:09.253]  Are the very same ones that are going to be attacking him for re-election next year.
[00:25:09.273 --> 00:25:11.954]  They're the very, very same people that would destroy him in a minute.
[00:25:12.254 --> 00:25:18.676]  And playing along with the bandwagon of attacking Trump is riding a dying dinosaur mainstream media.
[00:25:18.856 --> 00:25:20.177]  And that's what this comes down to.
[00:25:20.597 --> 00:25:23.558]  So I want everybody out there watching to understand it's bigger than Trump.
[00:25:23.858 --> 00:25:24.818]  It's bigger than Obama.
[00:25:25.079 --> 00:25:26.739]  It's bigger than Hillary Clinton.
[00:25:26.799 --> 00:25:27.699]  It's bigger than this.
[00:25:27.759 --> 00:25:28.820]  It's globalism.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.021]  It's a world government being formed.
[00:25:31.441 --> 00:25:34.702]  And Infowars, and you the viewer and listener that carried the ball for freedom,
[00:25:35.302 --> 00:25:36.563]  You are the resistance.
[00:25:36.923 --> 00:25:44.726]  And so on Facebook mentions, on the camera above me, or right here on the InfoWars feed, to all the viewers, this is what's happening right now.
[00:25:44.886 --> 00:25:48.928]  We know Hillary is coming for our guns and our sovereignty.
[00:25:48.968 --> 00:25:50.669]  We know Bernie Sanders is.
[00:25:50.749 --> 00:25:52.689]  We know Goldman Sachs is funding both of them.
[00:25:52.970 --> 00:26:02.914]  We know that the delegate process, we're going to talk about more with Richard, that's why Richard's on tonight when he comes back on, is to talk about what's broken big since we talked about it a few weeks ago and last week.
[00:26:03.314 --> 00:26:16.405]  That the Republicans are bragging with the Democrat insiders that they're going to game the delegates, have a brokered convention, and when they have that brokered convention, just like they did in 1980, they told Reagan, you take George Herbert Walker Bush or we're not going to nominate you.
[00:26:16.605 --> 00:26:21.550]  Well, they're saying they're not going to go with Trump or Rand Paul or any of these people.
[00:26:22.645 --> 00:26:25.067]  They're going to go with Jeb Bush even if he's 5% of the vote.
[00:26:25.087 --> 00:26:26.968]  They're going to steal those delegates and vote for him.
[00:26:27.188 --> 00:26:36.836]  So we need to get tonight to have them not go with the media questions, not go with the scripted BS or responding to Trump about banning Muslims until they fix the immigration problem and start checking their IDs.
[00:26:37.356 --> 00:26:43.701]  We need to get them to tweet at them and others before they go live and the media, because we're as big as the mainstream media now, or bigger.
[00:26:44.301 --> 00:26:46.444]  To point out, hey, what about a broker convention?
[00:26:46.624 --> 00:26:49.988]  What about these plans to steal the elections for the Bushes or the Clintons again?
[00:26:50.428 --> 00:26:54.633]  These are the big issues that we face, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:55.334 --> 00:26:56.735]  And so that's what I'm here to break down.
[00:26:57.036 --> 00:26:59.458]  We're about two or three minutes away from live coverage.
[00:26:59.839 --> 00:27:03.082]  A lot of new viewers tune in and they say, why are you talking over the debate?
[00:27:03.823 --> 00:27:07.866]  If you want the debate with limited talk over it, tune to CNN.
[00:27:08.286 --> 00:27:09.447]  They're out there in Las Vegas.
[00:27:09.467 --> 00:27:11.048]  We've got a reporter, Richard Reeves, out there.
[00:27:11.469 --> 00:27:13.230]  They're hosting it and putting it on.
[00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:14.251]  Other media's covering it.
[00:27:14.491 --> 00:27:19.054]  We're covering it, play-by-play, live, under fair use, under commentary.
[00:27:19.314 --> 00:27:21.056]  We couldn't do that if we were an entertainment company.
[00:27:21.636 --> 00:27:25.839]  Okay, we are a news gathering First Amendment free speech system.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:36.808]  And so we're here covering it with our view and our punditry and our analysis wearing the truth on our sleeve, our bias on our sleeve, taking action in this Christmas season.
[00:27:37.228 --> 00:27:37.888]  That's what we're doing.
[00:27:37.928 --> 00:27:38.789]  So you're tuned in.
[00:27:38.849 --> 00:27:40.510]  And I know most of you know this, but a small minority doesn't.
[00:27:40.751 --> 00:27:46.455]  You're tuned in to us commentary over it live, just like we do for the State of the Unions and other big events.
[00:27:46.835 --> 00:27:48.897]  So we're going to be at the RNC this year, the DNC.
[00:27:48.917 --> 00:27:49.977]  We're going to be covering it all.
[00:27:49.997 --> 00:27:50.818]  We've got the reporters.
[00:27:51.018 --> 00:27:52.059]  We've got the camera people.
[00:27:52.239 --> 00:27:53.059]  We've got the editors.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.240]  We've got the live feeds.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.341]  We've got the satellites.
[00:27:55.521 --> 00:27:56.822]  We've got the Aminathem stations.
[00:27:57.002 --> 00:27:59.604]  We're on cable, on basic cable right now in Houston, Texas.
[00:27:59.864 --> 00:28:02.706]  We're on radio in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in New York City.
[00:28:03.106 --> 00:28:09.931]  And InfoWars is exploding right now, and it's only evidence of the larger icebergs of liberty under the surface.
[00:28:10.271 --> 00:28:12.053]  So as Matt Drudge always says,
[00:28:12.973 --> 00:28:18.497]  New media, patriot media, needs to think of itself as important as CNN, as important as the New York Times.
[00:28:18.797 --> 00:28:22.880]  Quite frankly, we're more important than them, and we need to understand that.
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:31.065]  I'm going to throw it back to you guys, and then I'm going to be popping back in on the Skype feed from time to time with commentary, with analysis as well.
[00:28:31.406 --> 00:28:33.307]  We're also on the Facebook mentions right now.
[00:28:33.647 --> 00:28:37.310]  I'm going to hand it back to you guys there in Austin, Texas.
[00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:40.253]  Thank you, Alex, and we'll be listening for your report.
[00:28:40.273 --> 00:28:42.095]  We'll be watching that when you join us.
[00:28:42.275 --> 00:28:44.357]  And what Alex said there I think is very important.
[00:28:44.937 --> 00:28:52.766]  There was an article on Drudge Today saying that Jeb Bush had told his supporters about a month ago that by December the 15th we would see Trump in decline.
[00:28:53.386 --> 00:28:55.047]  We've seen just the opposite of that happen.
[00:28:55.067 --> 00:29:06.950]  And I think not only did the Bushes misunderestimate him, as his brother would say, but I think also Rand Paul is making a mistake to just come out with broad pronouncements and say Trump will be a disaster.
[00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:09.431]  If he disagrees with them, he needs to talk about the policies.
[00:29:09.531 --> 00:29:11.272]  And he doesn't treat Chris Christie that way.
[00:29:11.292 --> 00:29:15.793]  They put the two of them right next to each other on the debate stage tonight because they know there's always fireworks.
[00:29:15.853 --> 00:29:18.914]  Chris Christie is this authoritarian police state prosecutor.
[00:29:19.614 --> 00:29:25.436]  And so they put the Libertarian Rand Paul next to him, and they do get fireworks, but they're talking about policy.
[00:29:25.816 --> 00:29:32.079]  But then when they go after Donald Trump, they come after him with ad hominem attacks, they say he's not an official politician.
[00:29:32.119 --> 00:29:33.319]  Look, you know what?
[00:29:33.579 --> 00:29:37.861]  Cruz and Rubio and Paul haven't even finished a single term as a senator.
[00:29:37.881 --> 00:29:39.962]  Maybe what we need is unofficial politicians.
[00:29:40.082 --> 00:29:40.962]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:40.982 --> 00:29:42.603]  But haven't had their hand in the cookie jar.
[00:29:42.643 --> 00:29:43.083]  Exactly.
[00:29:43.423 --> 00:29:46.364]  Not being an official politician is exactly what people are looking for.
[00:29:46.564 --> 00:29:46.724]  Right.
[00:29:46.824 --> 00:29:51.386]  And so it's very naive to just say, he's an amateur, he's not ready for this, he'll be a disaster.
[00:29:51.726 --> 00:29:52.267]  Tell us why.
[00:29:52.607 --> 00:29:53.287]  You disagree with him?
[00:29:53.487 --> 00:29:54.027]  Tell us why.
[00:29:54.287 --> 00:29:56.048]  Or to say his supporters are soft.
[00:29:56.228 --> 00:30:01.491]  To say he has very soft supporters, clearly they've been rallying around him.
[00:30:01.671 --> 00:30:06.953]  No matter what he says, even if the media is like, this man is evil, racist, bad, bad.
[00:30:06.993 --> 00:30:08.214]  Everyone's like, Trump, Trump.
[00:30:08.854 --> 00:30:13.757]  Yeah, we've heard from Karl Rove that Trump had a very solid floor, okay?
[00:30:13.797 --> 00:30:15.638]  We've seen that he hasn't gone down, he's stayed there.
[00:30:15.658 --> 00:30:16.598]  That's very unprecedented.
[00:30:17.099 --> 00:30:19.680]  But then Karl Rove also said, but that's also a ceiling.
[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.081]  He's not going to go above that.
[00:30:21.521 --> 00:30:22.862]  Now we've seen that that didn't happen.
[00:30:23.102 --> 00:30:25.644]  Now we've seen him jump ten points or more this last week.
[00:30:25.964 --> 00:30:31.167]  Because he's not only talking about the open borders, but he's talking about in the context of our government.
[00:30:31.687 --> 00:30:37.970]  Not only demanding that we're going to send our troops to Syria, but demanding that they're going to bring jihadi troops into America.
[00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.211]  That they're going to fly them in here.
[00:30:39.271 --> 00:30:42.212]  Because they can't project their jihadi power into America.
[00:30:42.572 --> 00:30:44.953]  They're going to go fly them in.
[00:30:46.054 --> 00:30:46.654]  Import them.
[00:30:46.834 --> 00:30:53.837]  So they don't have to bother trying to cross the ocean, get into Central America, and come up through the soft, unpatrolled underbelly of America.
[00:30:54.037 --> 00:30:55.058]  They'll just bring them straight in.
[00:30:55.598 --> 00:30:56.078]  Just straight in.
[00:30:56.359 --> 00:30:56.559]  Yeah.
[00:30:57.119 --> 00:30:57.880]  First-class flight.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:18.374]  And also, too, we're seeing how they're really, you know, saying how Tashfeen Malik, the female shooter there, how she was able to pass three different background checks, even though she was making all these posts on social media in support of jihadism, and now they're coming around saying, well, we need to be able to look at the Facebook posts, so we need to be able to
[00:31:18.874 --> 00:31:25.340]  They're pretending that they're not looking at all that stuff, and we're seeing that stuff being sold to us by Fox News, FAUX News.
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:26.981]  It is absolute nonsense.
[00:31:27.021 --> 00:31:29.163]  We know that they're looking at everybody's stuff.
[00:31:29.183 --> 00:31:32.446]  Well, that's the problem is that they're looking at too much stuff.
[00:31:32.486 --> 00:31:35.769]  How can they, when you have someone that is specifically making
[00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:40.352]  Comments in celebration of Jihad, how do you not see that?
[00:31:40.652 --> 00:31:43.174]  If you're collating all this data specifically for terrorism?
[00:31:43.214 --> 00:31:44.975]  We also know they've told people to stand down.
[00:31:45.075 --> 00:31:48.597]  We've had people who are not at the top, because there's compartmentalization.
[00:31:48.877 --> 00:31:53.060]  So when people find this, they vet this out, they report to their supervisors, they're told to stand down.
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:58.263]  We were told by Thomas Drake that the people at the NSA were told to stand down.
[00:31:58.523 --> 00:31:59.944]  Let's go to a quick station break.
[00:32:00.164 --> 00:32:01.125]  Is that what you're saying, Rob?
[00:32:01.145 --> 00:32:02.245]  We need a Twitter station.
[00:32:02.265 --> 00:32:02.826]  Twitter station.
[00:32:02.846 --> 00:32:04.447]  Let's go to a Twitter station, not a station break.
[00:32:05.266 --> 00:32:06.487]  Let's go to our Twitter station.
[00:32:06.507 --> 00:32:08.248]  We've got Darren McBreen at the Twitter station.
[00:32:08.268 --> 00:32:09.008]  Darren, what you got?
[00:32:10.769 --> 00:32:12.590]  He's got no mic.
[00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:16.712]  This is a live broadcast, folks.
[00:32:16.832 --> 00:32:20.554]  Are we using the GOP debate hashtag as well?
[00:32:20.574 --> 00:32:21.055]  That's right.
[00:32:21.075 --> 00:32:22.155]  Hashtag GOPDebate.
[00:32:22.435 --> 00:32:27.618]  RealAlexJones at InfoWars and use the hashtag GOPDebate to send us in your questions.
[00:32:29.079 --> 00:32:32.401]  And Darren McBreen and Joe Biggs will be manning the Twitter station all night.
[00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:33.389]  That's right.
[00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:34.431]  We want to get your feedback.
[00:32:34.471 --> 00:32:36.033]  That's a very important part of the broadcast.
[00:32:36.313 --> 00:32:38.396]  Yeah, let's go back to Richard in Las Vegas.
[00:32:38.436 --> 00:32:45.866]  We have Richard Reeves, our reporter, on the ground right in front of the Venetian Hotel, Sheldon Adelson's house, where they're going to be having this debate.
[00:32:46.227 --> 00:32:46.487]  Richard.
[00:32:47.689 --> 00:32:48.189]  Yes, sir.
[00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:50.813]  Reporting with Infowars.com, Richard Reeves.
[00:32:53.324 --> 00:33:09.856]  And I'll tell you, Alex always says so much so fast that he was talking about how that the Republicans and Democrats and New World Order have all worked to conspire to set up a hijacking of delegates in the upcoming GOP in July in Cleveland.
[00:33:10.256 --> 00:33:20.183]  Now, the strange thing is, is like I discussed in one video, they created this splitter strategy where they knew that Jeb Bush could not win but about 20% of the popular vote.
[00:33:21.983 --> 00:33:27.905]  So they literally strategized about bringing in candidates and, you know, bringing in more candidates.
[00:33:27.925 --> 00:33:38.648]  That's why there's a whole slate of 15 or 16 candidates, because they want to split and divide and conquer down to a point where, oh, Jeb keeps his 20 and everybody else gets below 20.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:51.231]  And then when you get these winner-take-all delegate states like Florida, then Jeb Bush, with 20 percent of the popular vote in the primaries, could have and may still get hijacked, but he could have
[00:33:51.636 --> 00:33:54.697]  Potentially won the nomination for the Republican Party.
[00:33:55.057 --> 00:33:59.539]  The good news is, is they were not counting on Donald Trump jumping in this race.
[00:33:59.879 --> 00:34:07.882]  Because one of their ideas, by doing that strategy I just discussed, was that they would run Patriot candidates out of money.
[00:34:08.302 --> 00:34:17.165]  After 4 or 5 states, if you don't score up high in the numbers, if you're finishing 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, then your money dries up for the candidates.
[00:34:17.185 --> 00:34:21.046]  So you're going to see, once the primaries start in late February going into March,
[00:34:21.887 --> 00:34:24.468]  Then you're going to see candidates falling by the wayside real quick.
[00:34:24.488 --> 00:34:26.588]  So they weren't counting on Trump coming in.
[00:34:26.968 --> 00:34:33.110]  He's got his money that he needs to sustain him through the race all the way to the RNC and beyond.
[00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:36.071]  He's even getting donations from the general public.
[00:34:36.511 --> 00:34:37.771]  So he's got the money.
[00:34:37.811 --> 00:34:39.632]  So the GOP was not counting on that.
[00:34:40.032 --> 00:34:42.932]  Now, nonetheless, here's the situation as well.
[00:34:43.473 --> 00:34:45.093]  Is the GOP delegates
[00:34:45.658 --> 00:34:55.021]  Have been running the show for so long that they just know that normally, under normal circumstances, they win at the RNC just by showing up.
[00:34:55.641 --> 00:34:56.622]  Just by showing up.
[00:34:56.682 --> 00:35:07.685]  Just those warm bodies showing up to their precinct conventions, just by the warm bodies showing up to their caucuses, their caucus conventions, they have had sufficient numbers to rule the roost.
[00:35:08.045 --> 00:35:09.866]  So basically, they're on
[00:35:10.305 --> 00:35:28.698]  The flip side of where the Ron Paulers were in 2008 and 2012 because all the structuring that they've done to try to give this nomination to Jeb Bush is now they've got to figure out ways to change rules and undo things and make sure that their establishment delegates show up.
[00:35:29.058 --> 00:35:36.183]  So folks, that is the one way, barring a Trump collapse of him doing or saying something totally just
[00:35:36.676 --> 00:35:42.720]  Insane or crazy, it is really Trump's election to lose from a popular vote standpoint, from my perspective.
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:58.529]  But, potentially, if Trump loyalists, Trump delegates do not show up at their precinct conventions, at their precinct caucuses, then look for the GOP to bend rules, to break rules, to break laws, and, like I said, break heads.
[00:35:58.629 --> 00:36:01.530]  So, it's a very, very tricky thing.
[00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:04.212]  And the good news is, it only takes two or three percent
[00:36:04.653 --> 00:36:04.813]  I don't
[00:36:30.285 --> 00:36:46.398]  In the level and quality of Patriot candidates, and with the new media that we have, like Alex talked about earlier in his segment, he was talking about how that, you know, now we've got Skype and we're doing internet, he's broadcasting from home, you guys at the office, at the studio.
[00:36:46.932 --> 00:36:49.873]  And I'm here in Las Vegas on an iPhone, Skyping to you guys.
[00:36:50.273 --> 00:36:53.914]  With the Internet, we will be able to identify Patriot candidates.
[00:36:54.214 --> 00:36:55.594]  We will be able to self-identify.
[00:36:55.614 --> 00:36:57.955]  We will run over the dinosaur media.
[00:36:58.415 --> 00:37:06.057]  And that's how we can get good people elected because we get upstream of the process and get people on the ballot right at the beginning.
[00:37:06.497 --> 00:37:07.217]  Block Rhino.
[00:37:07.737 --> 00:37:15.080]  Block NWL candidates before they even get on the ballot and that's all that we can just do so much by overwhelming this small system.
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.120]  That's a great report Richard.
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:16.801]  Yeah exactly.
[00:37:16.861 --> 00:37:24.984]  They have created the rules, they run the system, they will bend, they will break, they will alter the rules and if that doesn't work they will steal it at the end.
[00:37:25.224 --> 00:37:32.007]  But I think it's going to be a, I think it's gonna be hell to pay if they do that a second time because we saw them do that to Ron Paul four years ago.
[00:37:32.487 --> 00:37:35.068]  And the support behind Trump is much larger.
[00:37:35.148 --> 00:37:38.850]  If people see that corruption, that could be a very valuable thing.
[00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:40.251]  So we're going to cover that very closely.
[00:37:40.551 --> 00:37:44.093]  Let's go to our reporter at the Twitter station, Darren McBrain.
[00:37:44.113 --> 00:37:44.393]  Darren.
[00:37:45.053 --> 00:37:50.516]  That's right, Darren McBrain coming to you live once again from the Infowars.com studios here in Austin, Texas.
[00:37:50.876 --> 00:37:54.178]  Once again, we have our very own Twitter booth set up this evening.
[00:37:54.798 --> 00:37:59.481]  And I'll be here for the next couple hours, along with Joe Biggs, who's going to step in from time to time.
[00:37:59.521 --> 00:38:01.162]  And we want to hear from you!
[00:38:01.682 --> 00:38:10.028]  Send us your questions and comments to at realalexjones and be sure to use the hashtag GOPdebate.
[00:38:10.468 --> 00:38:19.714]  And David, I thought it was funny earlier today, I stepped into the Matrix, watched a little bit of mainstream television, and they are already predicting a Donald Trump downfall.
[00:38:20.635 --> 00:38:28.326]  What I heard on Fox, it was a Fox 5, they were saying that up until this point Trump has been what they call a clown candidate.
[00:38:28.946 --> 00:38:35.295]  And they expect that Americans are going to start taking these debates more serious once we get closer to the election.
[00:38:35.796 --> 00:38:40.800]  You know, I don't know why they keep saying that, Darren, because that was the line of attack when Donald Trump first got in.
[00:38:41.241 --> 00:38:41.942]  And it didn't work.
[00:38:42.382 --> 00:38:43.643]  And it hasn't worked for several months.
[00:38:43.683 --> 00:38:47.246]  So I don't really understand why Fox keeps hammering that home.
[00:38:47.286 --> 00:38:48.607]  I mean, we talked about that.
[00:38:48.648 --> 00:38:53.852]  We talked about the fact that Jeb promised his donors that by today, by December 15th, you would see Trump in decline.
[00:38:54.152 --> 00:39:01.259]  Just the opposite of that, we've seen Karl Rove, of course, the Darth Vader in the background, or maybe another analogy of Star Wars.
[00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:08.364]  Nevertheless, he's talking about how Trump's got a very strong floor, but he's also got a ceiling he's not going to go above.
[00:39:08.645 --> 00:39:09.565]  That didn't happen either.
[00:39:09.665 --> 00:39:13.769]  So, you know, clearly Fox News is pushing these establishment candidates.
[00:39:14.149 --> 00:39:28.820]  If somebody comes out that is going to push relentlessly for more wars, for military buildup, for the typical neocon policies, somebody like Carly Fiorina, somebody like Marco Rubio, they're going to push those candidates.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.662]  Of course, Jeb Bush as well is in that candidacy.
[00:39:31.162 --> 00:39:35.146]  They're going to push those candidates, they're going to talk down the other candidates that they don't have control over.
[00:39:35.206 --> 00:39:37.428]  And that's what they expect Rand Paul to do tonight.
[00:39:37.448 --> 00:39:42.253]  And you heard it, Rand Paul, he said it's time to start going on the attack, you know, and go after Donald Trump.
[00:39:42.273 --> 00:39:49.981]  But be careful what you ask for, it may come true, because, you know, Donald Trump, it seems like that what doesn't kill him only makes him stronger.
[00:39:50.241 --> 00:39:53.144]  That's right, and if he comes after him and doesn't make it issues-based,
[00:39:53.804 --> 00:39:58.269]  I think it's really going to bounce back and to his harm.
[00:39:58.329 --> 00:40:05.976]  I think ad hominem attacks I don't think ever really are very effective and I really would like to see the candidates talk about issues.
[00:40:05.996 --> 00:40:17.146]  We have a lot of important issues and unfortunately the way these debates typically break down, they keep asking the same, recycling the same questions every election cycle, every debate of every election cycle.
[00:40:17.186 --> 00:40:18.848]  They ask the same questions over and over
[00:40:18.868 --> 00:40:19.108]  Right.
[00:40:19.208 --> 00:40:28.631]  Well, and we can also see even just with the JV debate that took place earlier, they're asking about ISIS and how would you stop them from radicalizing people via the internet.
[00:40:29.392 --> 00:40:30.392]  So it's all about terror.
[00:40:30.412 --> 00:40:32.353]  They're going to probably be very terror-focused.
[00:40:32.373 --> 00:40:37.615]  Of course, this will be the first debate after that terror attack that took place here in the U.S.
[00:40:38.015 --> 00:40:40.436]  So I do believe it's going to be sort of focused on that.
[00:40:40.936 --> 00:40:43.397]  And there are other huge issues out there.
[00:40:44.697 --> 00:40:45.177]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:41:02.782 --> 00:41:03.942]  But they didn't have a problem with that.
[00:41:04.182 --> 00:41:07.223]  It's like, you know, they're just talking about, well, under these circumstances and so forth and so on.
[00:41:07.563 --> 00:41:08.443]  They just don't care.
[00:41:08.483 --> 00:41:13.465]  We need to go back to a sane foreign policy of non-interventionism.
[00:41:13.925 --> 00:41:15.185]  Not isolationism.
[00:41:15.345 --> 00:41:17.505]  They have to have that military-industrial confidence.
[00:41:17.545 --> 00:41:19.306]  That's why they always keep pushing these things.
[00:41:19.346 --> 00:41:23.147]  And like we saw, that's pretty much the piece of the debate I got to see from the JV.
[00:41:23.187 --> 00:41:24.207]  That's all they talked about.
[00:41:24.887 --> 00:41:26.228]  ISIS and women in war.
[00:41:26.268 --> 00:41:32.049]  We're going to hear that a lot tonight because they picked this conservative talk show host, Hugh Hewitt.
[00:41:32.629 --> 00:41:36.472]  And that's one of his main things that he majors on, is war, okay?
[00:41:36.612 --> 00:41:40.555]  He loves the neocon wing of the Republican establishment.
[00:41:40.575 --> 00:41:42.237]  They said, look, this is CNN.
[00:41:42.857 --> 00:41:50.963]  We're tired of Democrats and people who are associated strongly with Democrat Party questioning and picking our candidates, essentially, you know, running the debate against them.
[00:41:50.983 --> 00:41:51.624]  And that makes sense.
[00:41:52.144 --> 00:41:53.165]  But then who do they go to?
[00:41:53.225 --> 00:41:57.428]  They go to the most warmongering talk show host they can find, Hugh Hewitt.
[00:41:57.688 --> 00:41:59.590]  So you're going to hear a lot about war tonight.
[00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:06.994]  And speaking of running the debate, they are still, we're watching it in here, and they're still going through a long, protracted intro.
[00:42:07.054 --> 00:42:08.995]  They've had, I guess, a prayer in the beginning.
[00:42:10.015 --> 00:42:11.576]  They're just going on and on and on.
[00:42:11.596 --> 00:42:12.837]  Did Anderson Cooper lead that prayer?
[00:42:14.898 --> 00:42:16.619]  It might have been the head of the GOP.
[00:42:16.639 --> 00:42:20.302]  I saw something going on there, but they still haven't brought the candidates out.
[00:42:20.322 --> 00:42:25.165]  So anybody watching, you can check us out at YouTube, The Alex Jones Channel.
[00:42:25.405 --> 00:42:27.907]  We're also live at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:42:28.327 --> 00:42:31.290]  And I know we've had a couple issues with InfoWars.
[00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:35.012]  I think so many people were hitting it InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:42:35.492 --> 00:42:41.857]  They're working on getting that back up, but you can go to YouTube right now and still watch the live stream if people are just listening to audio out there.
[00:42:41.997 --> 00:42:44.619]  That's right, very important that you can watch this on YouTube.
[00:42:44.699 --> 00:42:47.141]  It's also live streaming on YouTube as well.
[00:42:48.022 --> 00:42:50.424]  And thanks to those radio stations out there that are picking us up.
[00:42:50.644 --> 00:42:50.704]  Yes.
[00:42:50.724 --> 00:42:51.945]  That's always exciting to hear that.
[00:42:52.265 --> 00:42:52.466]  Yes.
[00:42:53.066 --> 00:43:06.357]  Now, Richard Reeves, our reporter in Las Vegas, and of course he's going to be going to Iowa, he's going to be going to New Hampshire, and those are great places to go because at this stage of the election, he can go in and meet these candidates one-on-one.
[00:43:06.377 --> 00:43:07.918]  They have very, very small crowds.
[00:43:07.978 --> 00:43:11.221]  Even though it was standing room only crowd for Rand Paul, it was 100 people.
[00:43:11.801 --> 00:43:21.706]  Uh, it's, in many cases, we just had a couple of weeks ago, Carly Fiorina was in a restaurant and people were laughing about the fact she addressed the people in the restaurant, asked if there's any questions.
[00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:25.668]  There was a pause, and then a little 8-year-old girl asked her some silly questions.
[00:43:25.688 --> 00:43:27.408]  She answered that question, asked if there's any more questions.
[00:43:27.428 --> 00:43:28.329]  No questions from anybody.
[00:43:28.689 --> 00:43:32.810]  So Richard's going to have a great opportunity to ask some really serious questions.
[00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:34.091]  It's a great opportunity there.
[00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:37.052]  And then after that it's going to become a big media circus.
[00:43:37.092 --> 00:43:41.573]  There's going to be a lot of TV buys with the Super Tuesdays that come up in March and that sort of thing.
[00:43:41.593 --> 00:43:45.334]  But we've got a couple of months window here where he's going to be talking to them.
[00:43:45.594 --> 00:43:50.656]  Let's go to a quick break before they pull up and begin the Dog and Pony Show.
[00:43:50.676 --> 00:43:52.456]  Yeah, the Dog and Pony Show there in Las Vegas.
[00:43:52.476 --> 00:43:53.937]  We'll be right back after this break.
[00:43:54.537 --> 00:43:55.918]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:43:56.179 --> 00:43:57.480]  You can't survive without it.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:58.581]  But where do you get it?
[00:43:58.881 --> 00:44:04.646]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand-new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:44:04.866 --> 00:44:10.612]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:44:10.772 --> 00:44:18.519]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities.
[00:44:21.301 --> 00:44:27.626]  Including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:44:28.047 --> 00:44:30.168]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:44:30.509 --> 00:44:31.710]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.770]  Easy assembly.
[00:44:33.031 --> 00:44:33.651]  Low maintenance.
[00:44:33.951 --> 00:44:35.773]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:44:50.644 --> 00:44:52.005]  Chef and PA, you're on the air.
[00:45:08.595 --> 00:45:09.375]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:45:09.515 --> 00:45:11.476]  Good, my friend.
[00:45:11.496 --> 00:45:12.277]  Thanks for having me.
[00:45:12.297 --> 00:45:13.697]  I'm a big fan of the show.
[00:45:13.717 --> 00:45:15.078]  I listen and read all the time.
[00:45:15.678 --> 00:45:17.359]  Thank you.
[00:45:17.659 --> 00:45:19.780]  I just have two things.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.262]  The one is a question I wanted to get your take on.
[00:45:23.282 --> 00:45:32.546]  What are your thoughts on the three Senators, Brad Wenstrup, Ken Calvert, and Mike Pompeo
[00:45:33.629 --> 00:45:44.115]  I don't think anything's going to come out of the investigation of them looking into CENTCOM, of Obama Doctrine, the record saying that they were containing ISIS and all that.
[00:45:44.736 --> 00:45:51.540]  You know, I'm glad you raised that because there was a headline in an article at Infowars.com yesterday
[00:45:54.304 --> 00:45:54.524]  Yes.
[00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:21.702]  Potentially a thousand times worse than Watergate or even Whitewater.
[00:46:22.183 --> 00:46:24.508]  You know, ripping off some properties.
[00:46:24.609 --> 00:46:25.992]  That's nothing compared to
[00:46:27.506 --> 00:46:29.287]  Turning whole countries over to Al Qaeda.
[00:46:29.747 --> 00:46:33.609]  Calling it a new name, having our military aid them, lying to the American people.
[00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:50.279]  And the fact that we've had all these generals go public and analysts go public, and now we have senators investigating it, it's just ultra-massive, and I need to go around to all my reporters and all my investigative journalists and my anchors and say, listen, you can cover whatever you want, because you've all got great instincts, I like what you cover.
[00:46:50.899 --> 00:47:03.441]  I mean, I'm very, very hands-off around here, but we need to make this a major, major, major priority, because I see so many headlines on InfoWars that get it right.
[00:47:03.882 --> 00:47:06.022]  You know, Western governments caught funding ISIS.
[00:47:06.742 --> 00:47:08.382]  Russia says West running ISIS.
[00:47:08.702 --> 00:47:10.443]  Russia says Turkey buying ISIS oil.
[00:47:10.643 --> 00:47:13.443]  It's all admitted, but those headlines aren't even hardcore enough.
[00:47:14.464 --> 00:47:16.144]  I see some headlines that we run that are like,
[00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.949]  U.S.
[00:47:18.009 --> 00:47:19.150]  underestimated ISIS.
[00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:20.310]  That's kind of the spin.
[00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:22.090]  They didn't underestimate Jack Squat.
[00:47:22.591 --> 00:47:24.871]  It started coming out that our government was funding it.
[00:47:25.231 --> 00:47:26.912]  Our own military said they wouldn't be part of it.
[00:47:27.192 --> 00:47:33.274]  So everything else has been an obfuscation, a muddying of the water, a smokescreen to confuse everyone.
[00:47:33.314 --> 00:47:36.495]  Hillary said, oh Benghazi and ISIS is fog of war.
[00:47:36.755 --> 00:47:37.875]  No, it's not, you witch!
[00:47:38.155 --> 00:47:40.196]  The fog's coming out of your broomstick, lady!
[00:47:40.436 --> 00:47:41.876]  You're running the whole stinking thing!
[00:47:42.056 --> 00:47:44.097]  We got you locked on target!
[00:47:44.577 --> 00:47:45.178]  You understand?
[00:47:45.238 --> 00:47:45.818]  Politically!
[00:47:46.059 --> 00:47:47.961]  All we gotta do is, I have you now!
[00:47:48.501 --> 00:47:50.243]  And it's... Goodbye!
[00:47:50.463 --> 00:47:51.004]  Goodbye!
[00:47:51.184 --> 00:47:51.664]  Goodbye!
[00:47:51.804 --> 00:47:52.385]  We have you!
[00:47:52.445 --> 00:47:53.746]  The generals are going public!
[00:47:53.967 --> 00:47:54.687]  It's so huge!
[00:47:54.747 --> 00:47:55.348]  It's so big!
[00:47:55.528 --> 00:47:56.409]  It's so bonkers!
[00:47:56.749 --> 00:47:58.571]  And I've been living with this for so long!
[00:47:59.052 --> 00:48:00.773]  I don't even color it properly!
[00:48:01.975 --> 00:48:03.056]  What is my problem?! !
[00:48:04.289 --> 00:48:07.231]  I'm telling you, we're going to get this done!
[00:48:07.431 --> 00:48:16.977]  These pieces of murdering filth think they can just run around and kill everybody in front of us and run Al Qaeda and run terror attacks and let the jihadis in and we don't do anything?
[00:48:17.238 --> 00:48:18.879]  We're going to do something about it!
[00:48:19.279 --> 00:48:20.680]  We're going to get out of our trance!
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.021]  We're going to get involved!
[00:48:22.201 --> 00:48:23.362]  We're going to expose it!
[00:48:24.019 --> 00:48:24.740]  Appreciate your call.

[00:48:53.151 --> 00:48:57.434]  Welcome back to our live InfoWars Nightly News coverage of the GOP debate.
[00:48:57.474 --> 00:48:58.215]  This is December 15, 2015.
[00:48:59.495 --> 00:49:02.017]  Joining me are Leanne McAdoo and Jakari Jackson.
[00:49:02.037 --> 00:49:02.598]  I'm David Knight.
[00:49:02.918 --> 00:49:07.861]  And you were just listening to our radio show earlier, where Alex took a call from someone.
[00:49:07.981 --> 00:49:13.745]  And that's the context you need to keep in mind when you listen to this debate, because they're going to hammer ISIS.
[00:49:13.846 --> 00:49:17.448]  You need to understand our involvement with ISIS, okay?
[00:49:17.488 --> 00:49:18.609]  Don't let them fool you with that.
[00:49:18.809 --> 00:49:19.810]  Let's go to the debate right now.
[00:49:20.251 --> 00:49:23.315]  We're having a first question, of course, on terrorism to Senator Rand Paul.
[00:49:23.375 --> 00:49:24.116]  Here's his response.
[00:49:24.516 --> 00:49:28.942]  The boots on the ground, the boots on the ground need to be Arab boots on the ground.
[00:49:30.124 --> 00:49:33.768]  As commander-in-chief, I will do whatever it takes to defend America.
[00:49:34.864 --> 00:49:39.607]  But in defending America, we cannot lose what America stands for.
[00:49:40.107 --> 00:49:42.368]  Today is the Bill of Rights anniversary.
[00:49:42.448 --> 00:49:45.891]  I hope we will remember that and cherish that in the fight on terrorism.
[00:49:46.071 --> 00:49:46.851]  Thank you, Senator.
[00:49:46.891 --> 00:49:47.752]  Governor Kasich.
[00:49:47.792 --> 00:49:50.633]  That was an excellent opening answer.
[00:49:50.733 --> 00:49:50.974]  Yes.
[00:49:51.194 --> 00:49:54.335]  If we lose our rights, we don't have an America.
[00:49:55.626 --> 00:49:56.266]  He's barely in, Rob.
[00:50:15.155 --> 00:50:16.696]  He doesn't like it because he's not doing well.
[00:50:17.036 --> 00:50:31.046]  Creating jobs, making sure people can keep their jobs, the need for rising wages, whether our children when they graduate from college can find a job, protecting the homeland, destroying ISIS, rebuilding defense.
[00:50:31.106 --> 00:50:33.487]  These are all the things that we need to focus on.
[00:50:33.668 --> 00:50:37.010]  I think ISIS is going to be the drinking game for this one.
[00:50:39.912 --> 00:50:43.414]  You know, I'm just so sick and tired of this phrase, homeland.
[00:50:43.634 --> 00:50:45.595]  It sounds just like fatherland, right?
[00:50:45.716 --> 00:50:46.836]  It sounds Nazi-fied.
[00:50:47.056 --> 00:50:48.537]  Just call it America.
[00:50:48.557 --> 00:50:50.959]  Why do we have to call it the homeland?
[00:50:51.019 --> 00:51:04.547]  That's the reason why we're arming and funding ISIS, is because they are going to now be the boogeyman, and they can move it around whenever they need to, ramp up support for whatever their agenda is by shoving that fear of terror down our face.
[00:51:04.847 --> 00:51:17.515]  And of course he's going to portray himself as being Mr. Economy, Mr. Jobs, when he was working for Lehman Brothers and getting half a million dollars as he was bankrupting pension plans for teachers in Ohio.
[00:51:17.535 --> 00:51:19.737]  ...provided to this country over the last number of years.
[00:51:20.537 --> 00:51:22.118]  Think about just what's happened today.
[00:51:23.019 --> 00:51:29.083]  The second largest school district in America, in Los Angeles, closed based on a threat.
[00:51:29.923 --> 00:51:30.724]  Irrational fear!
[00:51:30.804 --> 00:51:30.984]  A hoax!
[00:51:31.084 --> 00:51:31.284]  Yeah.
[00:51:31.304 --> 00:51:31.744]  Yeah.
[00:51:34.884 --> 00:51:39.227]  It's because of people like him that have sold this fear to everybody.
[00:51:39.267 --> 00:51:41.068]  They've got Americans afraid of their shadow.
[00:51:41.608 --> 00:51:43.850]  No longer the land of the free and the home of the brave.
[00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:49.994]  Well, except for that the Americans won't actually call in a credible suspicion because they don't want to be racist.
[00:51:50.134 --> 00:51:52.315]  Well, they're afraid of political... Americans have been paralyzed.
[00:51:52.395 --> 00:51:54.777]  Yeah, they're afraid of the political correctness.
[00:51:54.877 --> 00:51:56.057]  They're afraid of everything.
[00:51:57.498 --> 00:52:01.421]  ...and wonder about the safety of their wives and their children.
[00:52:02.577 --> 00:52:05.377]  What has Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton done to this country?
[00:52:08.176 --> 00:52:19.282]  You know, people who give their kids over to the government to strangers that they don't know on a daily basis should be worried about that more than they should be worried about an email that they see occasionally.
[00:52:19.342 --> 00:52:20.843]  I mean, that's the fundamental thing.
[00:52:20.943 --> 00:52:26.506]  We're supposed to be able to hand this over to the government and they're trustworthy on a daily basis.
[00:52:26.526 --> 00:52:33.490]  We can hand our kids over to total strangers, but if somebody sends in an email that implies there might be some kind of attack, we ought to tremble in our boots.
[00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:36.354]  We have completely lost our compass.
[00:52:36.394 --> 00:52:37.256]  Military troops will.
[00:52:48.243 --> 00:52:52.888]  Well they all pretty much came out and said the same thing, let's take America back, let's make America great again.
[00:52:52.949 --> 00:52:53.449]  Yeah.
[00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:56.112]  I'd really like to see somebody come out and say something different.
[00:53:04.562 --> 00:53:05.963]  I started as a secretary.
[00:53:05.983 --> 00:53:07.765]  What does she think the character of America is?
[00:53:07.805 --> 00:53:11.108]  You know, Rand Paul talked about it being the Bill of Rights.
[00:53:11.128 --> 00:53:13.309]  What does she think the character of America is?
[00:53:13.329 --> 00:53:15.791]  The fact that she was a CEO?
[00:53:15.851 --> 00:53:19.534]  While all the political insiders and the pundits told me it couldn't be done.
[00:53:19.555 --> 00:53:22.477]  I've been told no all my life.
[00:53:23.198 --> 00:53:26.660]  And all my life I've refused to accept no as an answer.
[00:53:27.681 --> 00:53:31.983]  Well, at one point she was told she could no longer be the CEO of Hewlett Packard.
[00:53:32.503 --> 00:53:33.503]  She had to take that no.
[00:53:33.923 --> 00:53:38.205]  She had to take no when she ran for Senate in California.
[00:53:38.265 --> 00:53:41.066]  They gave her a resounding no in California.
[00:53:45.647 --> 00:53:47.088]  This is not even the Peter principle.
[00:53:47.148 --> 00:53:48.508]  She hasn't even succeeded up.
[00:53:48.789 --> 00:53:50.349]  She's had a string of failures.
[00:53:50.969 --> 00:53:52.210]  And she's the actual president.
[00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:54.911]  Hey guys, our next president's about to speak.
[00:53:55.031 --> 00:53:55.791]  Y'all be quiet.
[00:53:57.625 --> 00:53:59.487]  I don't see the explanation mark after his name.
[00:53:59.507 --> 00:53:59.687]  Yeah, Bush.
[00:53:59.707 --> 00:54:03.370]  We've got the biggest, most powerful military in the world.
[00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:05.432]  You need to stop arming your enemies.
[00:54:06.553 --> 00:54:07.814]  That's what we need to start doing.
[00:54:26.638 --> 00:54:29.401]  Yeah, that's how we, that's how we designated our military.
[00:54:29.421 --> 00:54:30.842]  We turned over all the equipment to ISIS.
[00:54:30.862 --> 00:54:34.065]  Yeah, they're like, look at all that fancy new equipment they have.
[00:54:34.105 --> 00:54:35.806]  My goodness, how did that happen?
[00:54:36.027 --> 00:54:38.569]  And when we take on, we support our friends.
[00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:42.732]  As president, I will keep you and our country safe.
[00:54:42.832 --> 00:54:44.234]  It's Jeb!
[00:54:44.254 --> 00:54:48.097]  Because if he gets elected, everyone's going to be going, oh!
[00:54:48.697 --> 00:54:48.938]  What?
[00:54:49.318 --> 00:54:50.799]  Safe, secure, and free.
[00:54:50.819 --> 00:54:51.079]  The U.S.
[00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:53.962]  will keep you safe by sending your kids overseas to fight all of it.
[00:54:54.434 --> 00:54:55.954]  Six years here as a child growing up.
[00:54:56.074 --> 00:54:56.274]  Yeah.
[00:54:56.734 --> 00:54:57.875]  Not far from where we stand.
[00:54:57.955 --> 00:55:00.455]  Safe, secure, and then he adds free as well.
[00:55:00.775 --> 00:55:03.356]  He's innocent of enemy that they're funding.
[00:55:03.976 --> 00:55:04.236]  It's free.
[00:55:04.316 --> 00:55:09.417]  You know, the thing is, you can't be safe, secure, and free.
[00:55:09.737 --> 00:55:10.537]  Take your pick.
[00:55:10.777 --> 00:55:11.257]  Take your pick.
[00:55:11.537 --> 00:55:16.498]  It's just like when you win a cruise or something from a telemarketer.
[00:55:16.538 --> 00:55:17.038]  It's free.
[00:55:17.298 --> 00:55:18.358]  Free cruise.
[00:55:18.418 --> 00:55:21.899]  Just need to sign here on the dotted line, sell over your freedoms.
[00:55:22.259 --> 00:55:25.862]  Today, you have millions of Americans that feel left out and out of place in their own country.
[00:55:26.482 --> 00:55:30.625]  Struggling to live paycheck to paycheck, called bigots because they hold on to traditional values.
[00:55:31.386 --> 00:55:33.648]  And around the world, America's influence has declined.
[00:55:34.308 --> 00:55:37.431]  While this president's destroyed our military, our allies no longer trust us.
[00:55:37.451 --> 00:55:38.852]  He struggles paycheck to paycheck.
[00:55:40.452 --> 00:55:44.893]  He's had a lot of financial problems and he's waiting for that next paycheck from Sheldon Adelson.
[00:55:45.113 --> 00:55:49.174]  I'm just curious what their definition of Obama destroyed the military is.
[00:55:49.314 --> 00:55:54.875]  I'm not here cheerleading for Obama, but we still have a rather formidable military.
[00:55:55.195 --> 00:55:57.915]  Has military spending overall gone down?
[00:55:57.935 --> 00:56:01.956]  Well, he's destroyed them in the sense that none of that budget is going to the VA.
[00:56:02.396 --> 00:56:06.597]  So, I mean, once they get back here to America, they are.
[00:56:07.441 --> 00:56:09.963]  Our enemy is not violent extremism.
[00:56:10.783 --> 00:56:13.445]  It is not some unnamed malevolent force.
[00:56:14.526 --> 00:56:16.548]  It is radical Islamic terrorism.
[00:56:17.728 --> 00:56:20.791]  We have a president who is unwilling to utter its name.
[00:56:21.851 --> 00:56:30.898]  The men and women on this stage, every one of us, is better prepared to keep this nation safe than is Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton.
[00:56:33.357 --> 00:56:40.603]  We need a president who understands the first obligation of the commander-in-chief is to keep America safe.
[00:56:42.144 --> 00:56:46.227]  If I am elected president, we will hunt down and kill the terrorists.
[00:56:47.128 --> 00:56:49.269]  We will utterly destroy ISIS.
[00:56:51.411 --> 00:56:53.373]  We will stop the terrorist attacks.
[00:56:53.553 --> 00:56:56.795]  How many times do we have to say that slaves are never safe?
[00:56:56.815 --> 00:56:57.796]  Freedom comes first.
[00:57:01.019 --> 00:57:07.366]  The number one concern of Americans, according to the latest Gallup poll, is terrorism.
[00:57:07.386 --> 00:57:09.948]  They don't care about the economy.
[00:57:09.968 --> 00:57:10.769]  They don't care about liberty.
[00:57:18.891 --> 00:57:38.364]  Taxes they don't On TV then you know the economy or even even as they realize that their paychecks are being gouged and all these other things It's the TV keeps on be afraid of Isis Inception has been at war every 15 or 20 years, but the war that we are fighting now is
[00:57:39.125 --> 00:57:46.149]  Remember, as we hear this from Ben Carson, as we hear it from Ted Cruz, remember the American government's involvement.
[00:57:58.175 --> 00:57:59.876]  And equipping and starting ISIS.
[00:57:59.896 --> 00:58:00.776]  That's what we just played.
[00:58:01.056 --> 00:58:02.777]  That long rant from Alex Jones.
[00:58:02.817 --> 00:58:04.638]  We have ranted about this over and over again.
[00:58:04.658 --> 00:58:05.158]  We all have.
[00:58:05.218 --> 00:58:08.840]  Every one of us here on the stage has pointed it out again and again and again.
[00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:10.100]  We trained them.
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:10.820]  We armed them.
[00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:11.521]  We equipped them.
[00:58:11.561 --> 00:58:17.923]  We began by creating them as surrogates against the Russians, the Mujahideen in Afghanistan.
[00:58:17.964 --> 00:58:18.824]  We kept that going.
[00:58:19.204 --> 00:58:20.185]  We're good to go.
[00:58:41.445 --> 00:58:41.805]  That's right.
[00:59:01.249 --> 00:59:12.462]  Certainly would never have made that horrible, disgusting, absolutely incompetent deal with Iran, where they get $150 billion, they're a terrorist nation.
[00:59:13.644 --> 00:59:19.350]  But I began it talking about other things, and those things are things I'm very good at.
[00:59:20.899 --> 00:59:23.380]  That was a bit of a technical difficulty right there.
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:25.941]  You took a very different tack than, oh, we're back here.
[00:59:25.961 --> 00:59:27.201]  A month ago things changed.
[00:59:27.701 --> 00:59:33.223]  Radical Islamic terrorism came into effect even more so than it has been in the past.
[00:59:33.983 --> 00:59:42.346]  People like what I say, people respect what I say, and we've opened up a very big discussion that needed to be opened up.
[00:59:42.526 --> 00:59:43.226]  Thank you very much.
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:59.045]  I gotta say, you know, Rand Paul put essentially the same thing out as a bill, did it a month before Donald Trump did, and yet when Donald Trump came out and talked about it, said essentially the same thing in a condensed format, shorthand way.
[00:59:59.605 --> 01:00:02.126]  We gotta stop this until we can vet these people.
[01:00:02.726 --> 01:00:07.829]  Once he did that, then, you know, it zoomed him up in the polls.
[01:00:08.189 --> 01:00:09.549]  And people heard it.
[01:00:09.669 --> 01:00:12.931]  They didn't hear it when it was done as part of legislation.
[01:00:13.231 --> 01:00:13.371]  Right.
[01:00:14.127 --> 01:00:18.471]  Well, and that's the thing with needing to, needing to speak up, needing to be a little bit outrageous.
[01:00:18.611 --> 01:00:22.255]  Rand Paul didn't even come out and go, hey, I already, I already did that.
[01:00:22.315 --> 01:00:25.258]  You know, it's just, he sort of... Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:25.658 --> 01:00:27.820]  I don't know why he's afraid to speak out.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:37.510]  One million people and wall off America's southern border is the best way to make America great again, to isolate it from much of the rest of the world.
[01:00:38.857 --> 01:00:40.557]  We are not talking about isolation.
[01:00:40.717 --> 01:00:42.238]  We're talking about security.
[01:00:42.538 --> 01:00:44.018]  We're not talking about religion.
[01:00:44.138 --> 01:00:45.758]  We're talking about security.
[01:00:46.239 --> 01:00:48.159]  Our country is out of control.
[01:00:48.479 --> 01:00:50.680]  People are pouring across the southern border.
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:52.100]  I will build a wall.
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:53.280]  It'll be a great wall.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:56.101]  People will not come in unless they come in legally.
[01:00:56.401 --> 01:00:58.541]  Drugs will not pour through that wall.
[01:00:58.941 --> 01:01:01.802]  As far as other people like... What about under the wall though?
[01:01:02.182 --> 01:01:03.163]  Yeah, that's the thing.
[01:01:03.183 --> 01:01:04.645]  They're over the wall with drones.
[01:01:05.186 --> 01:01:08.650]  That's my deal when I always hear people talk about the wall and the border.
[01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:13.355]  Yes, I do agree we need security down there, but I don't think a wall is the definitive answer to that.
[01:01:13.415 --> 01:01:14.316]  We've seen the wall.
[01:01:14.396 --> 01:01:16.138]  Yeah, it's not very impressive.
[01:01:16.559 --> 01:01:18.601]  The problem is he says he's gonna stop the drugs on the wall.
[01:01:19.041 --> 01:01:21.504]  They have people die of drug overdoses.
[01:01:22.385 --> 01:01:28.791]  Hundreds of people every year in federal prisons because you can't keep the drugs out of a federal prison.
[01:01:29.031 --> 01:01:31.834]  You're not going to keep it out of a wall that stretches across the southern border.
[01:01:32.074 --> 01:01:35.117]  You need to address the root cause of these problems and that's what they won't do.
[01:01:35.277 --> 01:01:39.822]  There was a story that they had actually trained a mouse to carry cocaine around the prison.
[01:01:43.004 --> 01:01:45.806]  The problem isn't that we don't have a wall.
[01:01:45.826 --> 01:01:50.529]  The problem is that we've got a war on drugs and the conservatives need to understand it's a UN agenda.
[01:01:51.029 --> 01:01:59.735]  Ten years before Richard Nixon created, replicated the UN agenda verbatim, called it the war on drugs in 1971, the UN came out with it in 61.
[01:01:59.955 --> 01:02:02.957]  To be part of a coalition to destroy ISIS.
[01:02:03.477 --> 01:02:06.179]  The Kurds are the greatest fighting force and our strongest allies.
[01:02:06.479 --> 01:02:07.000]  They're Muslim.
[01:02:07.796 --> 01:02:09.997]  Look, this is not a serious proposal.
[01:02:10.418 --> 01:02:18.722]  In fact, it will push the Muslim world, the Arab world away from us at a time when we need to re-engage with them to be able to create a strategy to destroy ISIL.
[01:02:18.762 --> 01:02:24.065]  Here's Jeb Bush and the neocons of the GOP saying that we need to bring these people in who are allies.
[01:02:24.106 --> 01:02:26.167]  They don't even know who our allies are in Syria!
[01:02:26.707 --> 01:02:33.231]  They're handing weapons to people who are commanders of ISIS, people who were involved with Al Qaeda.
[01:02:33.672 --> 01:02:36.353]  Lindsey Graham and John McCain, they don't even know who these guys are.
[01:02:36.434 --> 01:02:37.814]  Jeb Bush doesn't know who these guys are.
[01:02:38.035 --> 01:02:41.317]  He can't even vet the leaders of these guerrilla groups.
[01:02:41.557 --> 01:02:44.799]  How are they going to vet hundreds of thousands of people that are going to be coming in here?
[01:02:44.819 --> 01:02:50.003]  John McCain was in a photo op, shaking hands, buddy-buddy with the leaders there, ISIS leaders.
[01:02:51.149 --> 01:02:53.390]  And frankly, I'm the most solid person up here.
[01:02:53.410 --> 01:02:54.951]  I built a tremendous company.
[01:02:55.311 --> 01:02:57.852]  And all I want to do is make America great again.
[01:02:58.212 --> 01:03:00.153]  I don't want our country to be taken away from us.
[01:03:00.173 --> 01:03:01.014]  You didn't build that, Trump.
[01:03:01.074 --> 01:03:01.974]  That's what's happening.
[01:03:02.214 --> 01:03:08.257]  The policies that we've suffered under other presidents have been a disaster for our country.
[01:03:08.517 --> 01:03:10.178]  We want to make America great again.
[01:03:10.558 --> 01:03:12.859]  And Jeb, in all fairness, he doesn't believe that.
[01:03:13.179 --> 01:03:14.580]  Look, he mentioned me.
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:15.040]  I can bring it.
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:15.600]  I can talk.
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:16.541]  This is the problem.
[01:03:17.521 --> 01:03:22.987]  Banning all Muslims will make it harder for us to do exactly what we need to do, which is to destroy ISIS.
[01:03:23.427 --> 01:03:24.128]  We need a strategy.
[01:03:24.148 --> 01:03:27.211]  You need to vet who you're bringing in before you let people come in.
[01:03:27.251 --> 01:03:28.192]  That's what he's talking about.
[01:03:28.232 --> 01:03:28.952]  That's what Trump said.
[01:03:28.992 --> 01:03:29.973]  That's what Rand Paul said.
[01:03:29.993 --> 01:03:31.014]  That's what Cruz is saying.
[01:03:31.034 --> 01:03:33.737]  You have no idea who these people are.
[01:03:33.817 --> 01:03:42.623]  Yeah, and I don't know how the whole system works, but I know that there are so many people who have been on waiting lists for years to be able to come to this country.
[01:03:42.663 --> 01:03:46.706]  They would bring a lot of business with them, a lot of money, and they're waiting.
[01:03:47.166 --> 01:03:49.648]  So let's open up the lines for some other people to come in.
[01:03:49.708 --> 01:03:59.114]  Well, you know, he doesn't, Jeb Bush and the Republican establishment, the Democrats, they don't know who these people are they want to bring in the country, but we know who Jeb Bush is.
[01:03:59.455 --> 01:04:01.076]  Quite frankly, we know this guy.
[01:04:01.336 --> 01:04:02.457]  We've vetted him for sure.
[01:04:03.652 --> 01:04:04.372]  Rubio as well.
[01:04:04.472 --> 01:04:09.954]  The new drinking games, every time they say safe, everybody has to drink their water.
[01:04:09.974 --> 01:04:11.455]  They tell you vaccines are safe too.
[01:04:11.475 --> 01:04:11.975]  That's right.
[01:04:11.995 --> 01:04:14.416]  Our foreign policy is safe and effective.
[01:04:14.436 --> 01:04:15.156]  Just remember that.
[01:04:33.629 --> 01:04:35.290]  They are actively recruiting Americans.
[01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:38.131]  The attacker in San Bernardino was an American citizen.
[01:04:38.151 --> 01:04:49.075]  I mean, Obama comes out all the time saying federal background checks do not work, yet he says bring in refugees because we're going to give them federal background checks.
[01:04:50.055 --> 01:04:50.496]  Yeah.
[01:04:50.776 --> 01:04:51.637]  It's just, it's insane.
[01:05:06.574 --> 01:05:08.156]  So we talked about the nightly news last night.
[01:05:08.596 --> 01:05:12.719]  In France, you saw the Socialists join with the Conservative Republicans.
[01:05:12.739 --> 01:05:15.242]  That's the name of the party in France, the Conservative Republicans.
[01:05:15.702 --> 01:05:16.843]  Same thing we got going on here.
[01:05:16.883 --> 01:05:30.815]  The Socialists and the Conservative Republicans joined here in America, just like they did in France, to shut down anybody who's concerned about letting in massive legions of people that we have no idea who they are into this country from war-torn areas, areas where we have created the war.
[01:05:32.956 --> 01:05:38.978]  With the kind of specificity and responsiveness you delivered in your nine Supreme Court arguments, how do you disagree with Mr. Trump?
[01:05:38.998 --> 01:05:39.738]  Will you spell that out?
[01:05:39.758 --> 01:05:41.659]  See, they keep throwing everybody against Trump.
[01:05:41.679 --> 01:05:45.760]  You know, I'm not here cheerleading for the guy, but it just seems like everybody is focused on Trump.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:45.880]  Yeah.
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:46.940]  Well, Cruz is too smart to fall for that.
[01:05:52.907 --> 01:05:54.688]  Alan Dershowitz was his professor at Harvard.
[01:05:54.708 --> 01:05:56.369]  He says he's the smartest student he ever had.
[01:05:56.389 --> 01:06:00.090]  He's too smart to attack Trump.
[01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:04.192]  His only hope to win is to get Trump's voters.
[01:06:04.232 --> 01:06:17.638]  And even worse, President Obama and Hillary Clinton are proposing bringing tens of thousands of Syrian refugees to this country when the head of the FBI has told Congress they cannot vet those refugees.
[01:06:18.578 --> 01:06:21.799]  And only 21% of Syrians support ISIS, though.
[01:06:21.859 --> 01:06:27.180]  It's only, you know, out of every 100 Syrian refugees you bring in, only 20 of them are going to sympathize with ISIS, though.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:27.621]  Keeping us safe.
[01:06:27.781 --> 01:06:27.961]  Yeah.
[01:06:28.001 --> 01:06:30.881]  So you're saying you disagree because he's too broad and you have a narrower focus?
[01:06:30.901 --> 01:06:31.822]  Why do you disagree with him?
[01:06:44.145 --> 01:06:48.149]  Well, you know, I'm reminded of what FDR's grandfather said.
[01:06:48.169 --> 01:06:54.316]  He said, all horse thieves are Democrats, but not all Democrats are horse thieves.
[01:06:57.009 --> 01:07:15.814]  In this instance, there are millions of peaceful Muslims across the world in countries like India, where there is not the problems we are seeing in nations that are controlled, have territory controlled by Al-Qaeda or ISIS, and we should direct at the problem, focus on the problem, and defend it.
[01:07:15.834 --> 01:07:17.494]  But how do you, I mean, they... How do you vet them?
[01:07:17.754 --> 01:07:23.520]  Right, how do you know that they're, they have already said ISIS probably has its own passport printing machines.
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:28.785]  So how do you know someone's gone into another country and then say, oh well I'm from India.
[01:07:29.026 --> 01:07:29.907]  I mean, there's no way to vet that.
[01:07:29.947 --> 01:07:34.952]  There's a group of moderate Muslims right there that all believe in Sharia law and they all claim to be moderate.
[01:07:34.992 --> 01:07:37.514]  They all claim you should have your hands cut off if you steal.
[01:07:37.795 --> 01:07:38.756]  Wives should be beaten.
[01:07:39.196 --> 01:07:40.216]  And they're all happy about it.
[01:07:40.236 --> 01:07:41.717]  I mean, they admit it, which is fine.
[01:07:41.757 --> 01:07:42.677]  That's their beliefs.
[01:07:42.877 --> 01:07:50.320]  But let's just all be truthful about what they really believe in and what they want to turn America into.
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:50.860]  Exactly.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:54.721]  And let's understand that what they're talking about is not strictly a religion.
[01:07:54.901 --> 01:08:01.323]  It is a religion that is connected inextricably to a political system and a rule of law.
[01:08:01.344 --> 01:08:02.604]  That's what they're talking about.
[01:08:03.004 --> 01:08:06.246]  They want to have civil penalties if you violate their religion.
[01:08:06.507 --> 01:08:08.988]  That is anathema to what we have in America.
[01:08:09.329 --> 01:08:19.676]  We have separation of religion because we saw the abuses that happened in Europe when Christianity got allied with this particular king or with that particular church.
[01:08:20.056 --> 01:08:20.917]  We saw what happened.
[01:08:21.197 --> 01:08:22.758]  And we said we don't want to have that anymore.
[01:08:22.838 --> 01:08:29.743]  And for the same reason, we don't want to have Islam here doing that same kind of combination of politics and religion.
[01:08:30.163 --> 01:08:32.406]  Right, are having Sharia courts.
[01:08:32.746 --> 01:08:33.147]  Yeah.
[01:08:33.287 --> 01:08:35.470]  Right alongside, you know, the constitutional courts.
[01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:40.516]  And then, Saudi Arabia is beheading people who dare speak against Islam, so.
[01:08:40.536 --> 01:08:44.982]  Well, they have absolutely no way to vet these people that they're going to bring in, and especially in such large numbers.
[01:08:45.382 --> 01:08:49.223]  And the numbers that they're bringing in, as John McCain said, look, I know these people.
[01:08:49.464 --> 01:08:50.764]  And of course, yeah, we know what happened.
[01:08:50.784 --> 01:08:51.724]  Yeah, he met with these people.
[01:08:51.744 --> 01:08:54.665]  And then later we found out that they were working with ISIS.
[01:08:54.765 --> 01:09:01.528]  So yeah, if you want to believe that he knows these people, you want to take him at his word where he says that 99.44% of them are OK.
[01:09:01.568 --> 01:09:02.288]  We'll run the numbers.
[01:09:02.308 --> 01:09:03.529]  They bring in 100,000 of them.
[01:09:03.769 --> 01:09:05.389]  That's about 1,200 jihadis.
[01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:09.691]  We've seen what happens when you've got two or six jihadis or whatever in different places.
[01:09:10.131 --> 01:09:11.732]  I was looking at what Fiorina was saying there.
[01:09:11.772 --> 01:09:13.693]  She was saying she wanted to beef up the NSA.
[01:09:13.753 --> 01:09:14.873]  Yeah, she keeps reiterating that.
[01:09:30.553 --> 01:09:37.537]  And she consulted with him on how they could get this through the American people when it was illegal, and they knew it was illegal.
[01:09:37.817 --> 01:09:44.161]  It was prohibited by FISA to spy on the American people, but she conspired with Michael Hayden to illegally spy on America.
[01:09:44.261 --> 01:09:45.661]  That's why Fox News loves her.
[01:09:45.962 --> 01:09:47.663]  That's why the Republican establishment loves her.
[01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:48.423]  That's why they're pushing her.
[01:09:48.443 --> 01:09:51.184]  It's probably why she'll get vice presidency or something.
[01:09:51.945 --> 01:09:52.405]  Right.
[01:09:52.465 --> 01:09:53.766]  She's definitely not going away.
[01:09:54.046 --> 01:09:56.707]  No, she's not going to win, but they might pull her in.
[01:09:58.965 --> 01:10:00.386]  Just about the same as the president's?
[01:10:01.207 --> 01:10:03.649]  Ensure fear does not paralyze Americans.
[01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:08.812]  That's kind of like when Bush told everybody to go shopping, go to the movies, just go be yourself.
[01:10:09.973 --> 01:10:16.438]  We're on an orange terror alert, but... Everything they do is meant to paralyze us with fear.
[01:10:16.498 --> 01:10:17.459]  That's how they run.
[01:10:18.019 --> 01:10:21.961]  Quite frankly, our government since 9-11 has been a terrorist government.
[01:10:22.001 --> 01:10:31.365]  They have used fear and the threat of violence, if not from them, sometimes it is directly from them, but if not from them, from some boogeyman that they created.
[01:10:31.605 --> 01:10:38.548]  They have used terrorism in America to establish their police state, to take our rights away, our due process away, and that's what he's talking about.
[01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:44.231]  We have a billion dollar TARP bailout for the banksters, because if we didn't, the sky would fall.
[01:10:45.151 --> 01:10:45.271]  Yeah.
[01:10:53.283 --> 01:10:59.808]  A cabinet who understands that the first and most important priority of the President of the United States is to protect the safety and security of America.
[01:10:59.828 --> 01:11:00.649]  No it isn't!
[01:11:00.749 --> 01:11:01.850]  You're disqualified!
[01:11:02.190 --> 01:11:09.657]  You have an oath to the Constitution and the oath to the Constitution says, and the Declaration of Independence says, you are created to protect our freedoms.
[01:11:09.997 --> 01:11:10.217]  Right.
[01:11:10.597 --> 01:11:11.938]  Not to keep us safe.
[01:11:12.339 --> 01:11:13.280]  They didn't want safety.
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:17.983]  They wouldn't have rebelled against the strongest government in the world if their first priority was safety.
[01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:19.184]  Their first priority was liberty.
[01:11:19.505 --> 01:11:21.026]  They created a government to protect that.
[01:11:21.166 --> 01:11:22.127]  I'm sick of these people.
[01:11:22.287 --> 01:11:22.487]  Right.
[01:11:22.587 --> 01:11:27.491]  Well, and that's why they want to take our guns so that they can say, well, see, now we have to protect you.
[01:11:27.851 --> 01:11:34.617]  But that's why we have the guns to protect ourselves and, you know, ensure that we can fight back against a tyrannical government.
[01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:36.718]  So, I mean, you're absolutely right.
[01:11:36.758 --> 01:11:38.260]  That is a key point.
[01:11:39.688 --> 01:11:44.793]  They knew who these people were, they stood down for these people, and all we're talking about tonight is terrorism.
[01:11:45.193 --> 01:11:50.859]  How they can take our freedoms, how they can destroy our way of life, so they can quote-unquote make us safe.
[01:11:51.019 --> 01:11:56.985]  We will not be safe when they destroy America, and America is about the Bill of Rights.
[01:11:57.025 --> 01:11:59.507]  That's why we created the government, to protect our rights.
[01:12:00.208 --> 01:12:01.309]  Not to protect the government.
[01:12:01.329 --> 01:12:02.030]  Not to keep us safe.
[01:12:02.050 --> 01:12:11.157]  How would you find a radicalized person in order to... How would you personally... They just said that President Obama was at the Pentagon the other day for the first time since July.
[01:12:11.197 --> 01:12:13.939]  So... It's not really his job.
[01:12:16.527 --> 01:12:18.189]  There are things called the joint terrorists.
[01:12:18.209 --> 01:12:28.164]  But why don't they ask them, how would you stop the CIA from radicalizing people in Europe, in Syria, in America?
[01:12:28.645 --> 01:12:29.926]  Because they're the ones who are doing this.
[01:12:31.163 --> 01:12:33.885]  How do we stop the government from radicalizing?
[01:12:33.945 --> 01:12:45.151]  They can't even find the radicalized people when they've got them on their terror watch list, or when they're on the no-fly list, or when they are communicating back and forth with known terrorists who are on the terrorist watch list.
[01:12:45.231 --> 01:12:46.232]  They can find them.
[01:12:46.472 --> 01:12:47.753]  They don't want to.
[01:12:48.593 --> 01:12:52.078]  They don't want to act on it because it suits their purpose.
[01:12:52.379 --> 01:12:53.360]  They want this to go off.
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:54.922]  They said, well, he was on a watch list.
[01:12:55.022 --> 01:12:56.585]  He was known to FBI agents, sir.
[01:12:56.925 --> 01:13:04.336]  The same thing FDR did to us on Pearl Harbor, except instead of it happening in one day, it's rolling out over a decade.
[01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:08.492]  ...that made it harder for the government to access Americans' phone records.
[01:13:08.933 --> 01:13:13.336]  In light of the San Bernardino attack... Harder for government to access phone records?
[01:13:13.496 --> 01:13:14.497]  Don't you think you made a mistake?
[01:13:14.517 --> 01:13:18.219]  They didn't shut down the NSA program until, what, a week or so ago?
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:21.702]  If you believe that, I've got a bridge to sell you a Brookline.
[01:13:21.722 --> 01:13:22.422]  They haven't shut down anything.
[01:13:22.442 --> 01:13:25.825]  And she had been making these jihadi comments for years.
[01:13:26.185 --> 01:13:28.126]  They said they had been radicalized since at least 2012.
[01:13:29.227 --> 01:13:32.189]  So they had been scooping up... And that's way before Snowden.
[01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:33.871]  So there was nothing stopping them.
[01:13:34.731 --> 01:13:39.013]  Well, the issue with this bulk data collection, because I think you guys may recall that story.
[01:13:39.073 --> 01:13:40.353]  I think a guy came from the UK.
[01:13:40.373 --> 01:13:44.334]  He's like, I'm going to blow up America, something like that, saying he's going to go to some wild party.
[01:13:44.615 --> 01:13:45.935]  He got detained at the airport.
[01:13:45.955 --> 01:13:48.476]  This is a guy who posed no threats, you know, some college kid.
[01:13:48.736 --> 01:13:50.657]  And they'll arrest this guy, give him the third degree.
[01:13:50.677 --> 01:13:54.758]  But meanwhile, you got people sympathizing with ISIS, saying they want to come over here and do real harm.
[01:13:55.118 --> 01:13:59.960]  But the bulk data coverage doesn't allow people to zero in on these such individuals.
[01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:10.844]  I'm not saying I want them to surveil American citizens and all that stuff, but if you have people overseas who are doing these things and you have the NSA anyway, why don't you actually pay attention to the actions that these people are taking?
[01:14:10.864 --> 01:14:12.865]  Right, they're scooping up too much data.
[01:14:13.966 --> 01:14:21.169]  Every American's metadata from every single conversation in any sort of technical capacity, it's too much.
[01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:27.233]  He says they always focus on law-abiding citizens instead of Islamic terrorists.
[01:14:27.553 --> 01:14:29.174]  Well, here's the issue, okay?
[01:14:29.835 --> 01:14:32.356]  Yeah, Obama gets that wrong, but Ted Cruz got that wrong.
[01:14:32.396 --> 01:14:37.700]  Because, as you're pointing out, she's making, she's radicalized, making statements on social media.
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:41.122]  She was not in America when she was making some of these statements.
[01:14:42.203 --> 01:14:48.988]  The FISA Act, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, authorizes them to examine people outside of the country.
[01:14:49.028 --> 01:14:50.349]  That would have been legal for them to do.
[01:14:50.629 --> 01:14:58.030]  Instead, they do it on people in America, and then they let radicals who are outside of America get a pass and come into our country.
[01:14:58.211 --> 01:15:00.091]  It's an absolute perversion of what's going on.
[01:15:00.311 --> 01:15:05.772]  They put the FISA Act in because they were listening to Americans in the 60s and the 70s.
[01:15:06.032 --> 01:15:08.893]  The Church Commission, the Pike Commission said, you can't do that anymore.
[01:15:08.913 --> 01:15:09.993]  We're going to put the FISA Act in.
[01:15:10.253 --> 01:15:14.934]  Then they use that to get a blanket search warrant against Mr. and Mrs. Verizon, as Rand Paul said.
[01:15:15.994 --> 01:15:17.035]  And that's what they pointed out.
[01:15:17.055 --> 01:15:20.899]  When the whole Snowden story broke, that's the thing that they pointed out.
[01:15:20.959 --> 01:15:29.207]  That they were only scooping up this data of Americans in America if they were in contact with terrorists overseas or if those conversations were overseas.
[01:15:29.287 --> 01:15:35.793]  And we know that Farouk was in contact with terrorist organizations while he was here in America.
[01:15:36.674 --> 01:15:41.535]  If they had gone by the rule of the FISA law, then they would have contacted these people.
[01:15:41.615 --> 01:15:42.655]  It would have been actionable.
[01:15:42.715 --> 01:15:44.196]  They could have kept them out of the country.
[01:15:44.676 --> 01:15:45.636]  But they didn't do any of that.
[01:15:45.816 --> 01:15:48.337]  Now they use that to argue for greater expansion.
[01:15:48.357 --> 01:15:53.138]  That's why I say, this is exactly what FDR did to us at Pearl Harbor.
[01:15:53.198 --> 01:15:54.978]  They had the intelligence from the Japanese.
[01:15:54.998 --> 01:15:56.479]  They knew precisely what they were going to do.
[01:15:56.919 --> 01:15:57.519]  They let them do it.
[01:15:58.468 --> 01:16:04.211]  Yeah, let's go to Richard and we hear that he's got somebody on the street.
[01:16:04.231 --> 01:16:08.052]  Let's go to Richard Reeves in Las Vegas, right outside where the debate is happening.
[01:16:08.092 --> 01:16:08.592]  Richard Reeves.
[01:16:09.313 --> 01:16:10.993]  Alright, David, thank you for the handoff there.
[01:16:11.254 --> 01:16:13.134]  And Alex, this should warm your heart.
[01:16:13.174 --> 01:16:14.015]  Here we have Blake.
[01:16:14.595 --> 01:16:19.017]  He's a listener and we wanted to ask him, what do you think is the bigger concern, Blake?
[01:16:19.037 --> 01:16:23.759]  Do you think it's the bigger concern about terrorism or the economy for you and Americans?
[01:16:24.693 --> 01:16:29.718]  I think I'm more concerned about the financial terrorists that are destroying the economy right now.
[01:16:30.939 --> 01:16:34.302]  Jenny Yellen and the people running the Federal Reserve.
[01:16:34.702 --> 01:16:37.424]  I'm here hopefully getting one of the better candidates.
[01:16:37.444 --> 01:16:39.006]  There's some interesting candidates running.
[01:16:39.026 --> 01:16:40.667]  I think Rand Paul is a good guy.
[01:16:40.687 --> 01:16:42.809]  I'm hoping he has a good showing tonight because we need that.
[01:16:43.049 --> 01:16:48.274]  He's one of the few guys that's actually talking about auditing and maybe abolishing the Federal Reserve.
[01:16:48.294 --> 01:16:49.796]  A couple other people that are alright.
[01:16:50.496 --> 01:16:51.758]  Yeah, that is a lot more concerning.
[01:16:51.798 --> 01:16:55.963]  I'm not sure how much of the terrorism is manufactured or what not.
[01:16:56.123 --> 01:16:59.186]  Hey Richard, hang on there right now.
[01:16:59.226 --> 01:17:01.529]  We got Rand Paul talking about surveillance.
[01:17:01.569 --> 01:17:02.150]  What do you do with it?
[01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:02.931]  Hold on right there.
[01:17:02.951 --> 01:17:03.912]  We're going to come right back to you.
[01:17:03.932 --> 01:17:05.694]  We're going to go live to what Rand Paul is saying.
[01:17:05.834 --> 01:17:10.997]  That might have stopped Senator Bernardino, that might have stopped 9-11, would have been stricter controls on those who came here.
[01:17:11.417 --> 01:17:17.321]  And Marco has opposed at every point increased security, border security, for those who come to our country.
[01:17:17.841 --> 01:17:28.368]  On his Gang of Eight bill, he would have liberalized immigration, but he did not, and he steadfastly opposed any new border security requirements for refugees or students.
[01:17:29.208 --> 01:17:34.070]  Last week, I introduced another bill saying we need more security, we need more scrutiny.
[01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:35.911]  Once again, Marco opposed this.
[01:17:36.271 --> 01:17:37.771]  So Marco can't have it both ways.
[01:17:37.811 --> 01:17:44.294]  He thinks he wants to be this, oh, I'm great and strong on national defense, but he's the weakest of all the candidates on immigration.
[01:17:44.614 --> 01:17:47.955]  He is the one for an open border that is leaving us defenseless.
[01:17:48.215 --> 01:17:57.459]  If we want to defend the country, we have to defend against those who are coming in, and Marco has more of an allegiance to Chuck Schumer and to the liberals than he does to conservative policy.
[01:17:59.332 --> 01:18:00.235]  Get over it.
[01:18:04.987 --> 01:18:11.931]  I want to thank Grant for another 30 seconds, because number one, what he's pointing to is a bill last week, an amendment he voted for that only 10 people voted for.
[01:18:11.971 --> 01:18:12.392]  You know why?
[01:18:12.412 --> 01:18:14.073]  Because it's not focused on terrorists.
[01:18:14.413 --> 01:18:15.874]  It would have banned anyone from coming here.
[01:18:15.934 --> 01:18:19.056]  Someone from Taiwan would not have been able to come here as a tourist.
[01:18:19.476 --> 01:18:26.480]  Number two, this program, this metadata program, is actually more strict than what a regular law enforcement agency has now.
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:31.003]  If a regular law enforcement agency wants your phone records, all they have to do is issue a subpoena.
[01:18:31.443 --> 01:18:37.186]  But now the intelligence agency is not able to quickly gather records and look at them to see who these terrorists are calling.
[01:18:37.206 --> 01:18:38.587]  They already have the records.
[01:18:38.607 --> 01:18:40.247]  They've got so many, they can't look through them.
[01:18:40.408 --> 01:18:41.988]  What does he mean they're not able to?
[01:18:42.048 --> 01:18:44.470]  And they keep telling us that metadata is not important.
[01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:47.351]  Look, metadata is one of the most important things they can get on you.
[01:18:48.312 --> 01:18:49.712]  It's activity-based intelligence.
[01:18:49.992 --> 01:18:53.814]  Hang on, let's get the rebut from Rand Paul, who gets it.
[01:18:53.854 --> 01:18:55.035]  Can I respond?
[01:18:55.075 --> 01:18:56.135]  Go ahead, please.
[01:18:58.126 --> 01:19:00.787]  Marco still misunderstands the immigration issue.
[01:19:00.867 --> 01:19:11.851]  What I put forward was an amendment that would have temporarily halted immigration from high-risk terrorist countries, but it would have started it up, but I want them to go through global entry, which is a program where we do background checks.
[01:19:12.291 --> 01:19:17.453]  The thing is, is that every terrorist attack we've had since 9-11 has been legal immigration.
[01:19:17.853 --> 01:19:19.213]  Marco wants to expand that.
[01:19:19.613 --> 01:19:24.275]  I want more rules, more scrutiny, and to defend the country, you have to defend the border.
[01:19:25.055 --> 01:19:26.936]  Senator, we're going to talk about immigration in a while.
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:28.752]  Okay, let's go back to Richard Reeves.
[01:19:28.813 --> 01:19:29.579]  Richard, are you still there?
[01:19:31.445 --> 01:19:31.825]  Yes, sir.
[01:19:31.865 --> 01:19:32.686]  David's still here.
[01:19:32.946 --> 01:19:35.628]  Yeah, we just had a back and forth, but I don't know if you were able to hear that.
[01:19:35.668 --> 01:19:44.876]  We just had a back and forth between Rand Paul and Marco Rubio as to whether or not they should have any kind of controls or background checks on people coming out of the country.
[01:19:45.576 --> 01:19:51.301]  Rand Paul was calling Rubio out for trying to expand it and loosen those controls in the face of all this.
[01:19:51.341 --> 01:19:51.941]  Go ahead.
[01:19:52.722 --> 01:19:54.223]  Do you still have the gentleman there?
[01:19:54.723 --> 01:19:55.064]  He's gone.
[01:19:55.124 --> 01:19:57.886]  Well, Blake has left, but I'll tell you,
[01:19:58.365 --> 01:20:00.366]  Rand Paul is finally really hot on the border.
[01:20:00.386 --> 01:20:11.453]  For a lot of libertarians, they wanted open borders, but you know, a talking point that keeps coming up is how do we identify an enemy, you know, how do we fight an enemy if we don't even identify them?
[01:20:12.233 --> 01:20:18.717]  And I look forward to the day that we have a full slate of presidential candidates and a veto-proof
[01:20:19.508 --> 01:20:25.571]  Majority in the Senate and a veto-proof majority in the House that identifies the enemy as the New World Order.
[01:20:25.891 --> 01:20:31.434]  How in the world can we have a chance of really fighting terrorism if we don't just finally pin it down?
[01:20:31.454 --> 01:20:32.375]  Hey, you know what?
[01:20:32.795 --> 01:20:43.901]  New World Order, we know you are Dr. Frankenstein, and you not only have created one Frankenstein monster, you've created probably tens of thousands of Frankenstein monsters, and you've unleashed them upon the Western world.
[01:20:44.665 --> 01:20:45.826]  I look forward to that day.
[01:20:45.926 --> 01:20:55.493]  I think, hopefully, I, well, it seems like some of these candidates know that truth and whether or not they'll be able to express it at some point, hopefully in the near future, we'll see.
[01:20:55.853 --> 01:20:56.593]  Well, thanks Richard.
[01:20:56.633 --> 01:20:57.994]  We're going to go back to the debate right now.
[01:20:58.014 --> 01:21:01.677]  We got Chris Christie declaring his love for the Patriot Act, as usual.
[01:21:01.917 --> 01:21:04.659]  Let's go to that real quickly and then we're going to go to our Twitter channel.
[01:21:04.699 --> 01:21:05.460]  Actually, he just finished.
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:09.042]  Let's go to our, let's go to Darren McBreen at the Twitter station.
[01:21:09.062 --> 01:21:09.382]  Darren.
[01:21:12.264 --> 01:21:12.765]  Okay, Darren.
[01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.830]  Alright.
[01:21:14.851 --> 01:21:16.351]  Here we are, back to the debate.
[01:21:16.392 --> 01:21:18.993]  Mosques and schools where there's anti-American sentiment.
[01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:23.436]  It's the first time I've spoken and some people have had multiple questions.
[01:21:23.496 --> 01:21:24.317]  Just talk.
[01:21:24.457 --> 01:21:26.898]  Yeah, there's the moment of silence here.
[01:21:30.379 --> 01:21:41.468]  What my point is, we need to make sure that any place, I don't care whether it's a mosque, a school, a supermarket, you know, a theater, it doesn't matter.
[01:21:41.749 --> 01:21:48.955]  If there are a lot of people getting there, engaging in radicalizing activities, then we need to be suspicious of it.
[01:21:48.995 --> 01:21:54.299]  We have to get rid of all this PC stuff, and people are worried about somebody.
[01:21:54.359 --> 01:21:57.202]  Yeah, here he is selling us as authoritarian paranoia.
[01:21:58.309 --> 01:22:03.112]  Uh, no matter where people are, we need to be aware of what they're doing and crack down on them if we don't like what they're saying.
[01:22:03.852 --> 01:22:07.675]  And I guess he would say the President's the one who gets to decide what's legitimate or not.
[01:22:07.715 --> 01:22:11.317]  Or maybe he's going to turn that over to Homeland Security, somebody like Janet Napolitano.
[01:22:11.397 --> 01:22:14.919]  Yeah, he's another guy who's pushing out for the surveillance state.
[01:22:14.939 --> 01:22:15.199]  Go ahead.
[01:22:15.359 --> 01:22:24.325]  All colleges are anti-American now because they're turning kids into socialists and saying, who cares about freedom of speech?
[01:22:24.485 --> 01:22:27.287]  Your feelings are more important than facts and liberty.
[01:22:27.387 --> 01:22:30.369]  So we're going to have to just monitor everyone.
[01:22:30.389 --> 01:22:35.812]  I think you have to ask them about that.
[01:22:37.393 --> 01:22:39.794]  I don't want to get in between them.
[01:22:39.814 --> 01:22:43.457]  He doesn't want to take a position on civil liberties or...
[01:22:44.571 --> 01:22:46.732]  I'm betting immigrants.
[01:22:46.772 --> 01:22:55.215]  He should have taken that opportunity to explain how he feels about that, rather than... Isn't it amazing that this is what we have to choose from?
[01:22:55.235 --> 01:22:59.377]  As if we really have a choice, I don't know.
[01:22:59.417 --> 01:23:05.399]  Right, that whoever we would really want up there and... A bunch of pathetic puppets.
[01:23:05.619 --> 01:23:06.799]  Something there with the delegates.
[01:23:07.079 --> 01:23:13.542]  If we want to destroy ISIS, if we want to destroy radical Islamic terrorism, we can't disassociate ourselves from
[01:23:14.289 --> 01:23:21.131]  So it's funny how they're continually saying radical Islamic terrorism to just differentiate themselves from the other side who refuses to say it.
[01:23:21.151 --> 01:23:23.252]  The last debate they would not say it.
[01:23:23.652 --> 01:23:30.414]  It'll be interesting to see if they say it this time since there's been another first ISIS terror attack on US soil.
[01:23:32.734 --> 01:23:35.135]  Yeah.
[01:23:36.035 --> 01:23:42.856]  Your brother said Islam is peace.
[01:23:43.296 --> 01:23:56.559]  Yeah, we shouldn't be talking about these things in public because we got this closed, dark, secret government that can't trust the American people and we shouldn't have any say-so, oversight, or opinion about what these people are doing and if we know they're going to kill us, you know?
[01:23:56.599 --> 01:23:56.899]  So, yeah.
[01:23:57.739 --> 01:23:58.740]  Thank you, thank you.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:02.224]  I guess Daddy told him that from the CIA days, you know?
[01:24:02.264 --> 01:24:03.024]  Yeah, military second to none.
[01:24:03.044 --> 01:24:05.947]  I thought we had the largest military in the world.
[01:24:05.967 --> 01:24:07.509]  Most powerful military in the world.
[01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.929]  Yeah.
[01:24:08.010 --> 01:24:09.131]  I don't know.
[01:24:09.191 --> 01:24:10.392]  Let's go to the Twitter station.
[01:24:10.412 --> 01:24:10.953]  Derrick Green.
[01:24:10.973 --> 01:24:11.213]  Hey guys.
[01:24:19.462 --> 01:24:29.533]  On Twitter tonight, we're also monitoring, we've been turning the channels and watching the mainstream news media's coverage of the debate and the propaganda behind the debate.
[01:24:29.573 --> 01:24:41.945]  And very interesting, I thought it was, this was kind of weird, Fox News, they admit that Donald Trump is the anti-establishment candidate, but they'd like to see him become a little more establishment before they'll take him serious.
[01:24:44.321 --> 01:24:45.902]  I swear to God.
[01:25:06.630 --> 01:25:09.832]  And then another thing, once again, you've got Lindsey Graham.
[01:25:10.292 --> 01:25:12.113]  Lindsey Graham was asked a question earlier.
[01:25:12.653 --> 01:25:16.075]  How do you think we're gonna deal with the online threat of ISIS?
[01:25:16.515 --> 01:25:17.056]  He goes, well...
[01:25:17.932 --> 01:25:25.519]  We should send 10,000 troops to Syria, and then 10,000 to Iraq, and then kill them all so they can't get online, and that's how we defeat them online.
[01:25:26.019 --> 01:25:27.981]  Hey, boy, he sounds like a military genius.
[01:25:28.281 --> 01:25:36.409]  I think somebody ought to ask Lindsey Graham why he continues to stay in the race when he is flatlined at zero in the polls.
[01:25:36.529 --> 01:25:37.570]  Well, how do they go and say that?
[01:25:41.039 --> 01:25:43.281]  How many people are even in that JV debate at this point?
[01:25:43.621 --> 01:25:44.541]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:44.642 --> 01:25:45.782]  I think we lost your audio feed.
[01:25:45.802 --> 01:25:46.203]  Let's go back.
[01:25:46.223 --> 01:25:50.105]  I was going to say, how do they go in and barely let Rand Paul into the debate?
[01:25:50.425 --> 01:25:53.227]  But then you have Kasich in there who clearly made it.
[01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:56.109]  And then his opening statements are, I don't even like politics.
[01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:57.851]  Basically, he doesn't want to be here.
[01:25:58.191 --> 01:25:59.231]  Get him the hell out of here.
[01:25:59.432 --> 01:26:01.353]  Let's hear more Rand Paul, what he's got to say.
[01:26:01.533 --> 01:26:02.114]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:02.395 --> 01:26:12.894]  Reminded me very much of that first Democrat debate where they got the guy who subsequently dropped out and they asked him about a decision they made and he goes, well, my dad had just died, I was kind of depressed, or I voted for the war, or whatever.
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:15.122]  Yeah, it was my first vote.
[01:26:15.382 --> 01:26:16.263]  My dad died.
[01:26:16.283 --> 01:26:16.803]  Okay, here she is.
[01:26:16.823 --> 01:26:19.646]  She's reminding us again that once upon a time she was a CEO.
[01:26:19.966 --> 01:26:26.852]  We should remind everybody that the stock price of Hewlett-Packard tanked as bad as the banks in Greece, okay?
[01:26:26.892 --> 01:26:29.275]  When they closed, they lost 50% of their stock value.
[01:26:29.575 --> 01:26:31.777]  That's what happened to Hewlett-Packard under Carly Fiorina.
[01:26:31.997 --> 01:26:33.258]  Here's Donald Trump, let's listen.
[01:26:49.273 --> 01:26:51.695]  Well, look, it's so easy to answer.
[01:26:52.276 --> 01:26:54.478]  ISIS is recruiting through the Internet.
[01:26:54.678 --> 01:27:00.583]  ISIS is using the Internet better than we are using the Internet, and it was our idea.
[01:27:00.623 --> 01:27:02.385]  So is the Department of Work and Pensions.
[01:27:02.405 --> 01:27:05.208]  What I wanted to do is I wanted to get our brilliant people from Silicon Valley and other places.
[01:27:05.228 --> 01:27:05.888]  That's what we just saw today.
[01:27:05.908 --> 01:27:07.149]  The British are doing it.
[01:27:07.249 --> 01:27:12.214]  They traced the IP addresses back to the British, as you pointed out, Rob, back to the British intelligence there.
[01:27:12.234 --> 01:27:14.476]  You talk freedom of speech, you talk freedom of anything you want.
[01:27:14.636 --> 01:27:21.665]  Well, we also know there's a lot of British, young British men that have gone and become radicalized and then are back there in Europe, so.
[01:27:21.965 --> 01:27:24.408]  He just doubled down, he said he would talk freedom of speech.
[01:27:24.729 --> 01:27:26.551]  He has contempt for the Bill of Rights.
[01:27:27.292 --> 01:27:28.874]  That is a very dangerous combination.
[01:27:30.576 --> 01:27:32.577]  We have to change it from every standpoint.
[01:27:32.917 --> 01:27:41.361]  But we should be using our brilliant people, our most brilliant minds, to figure a way that ISIS cannot use the Internet.
[01:27:41.421 --> 01:27:49.644]  And then on second, we should be able to penetrate the Internet and find out exactly where ISIS is and everything about ISIS.
[01:27:49.704 --> 01:27:51.425]  Except that's exactly what China does.
[01:27:51.705 --> 01:27:53.045]  Right.
[01:27:53.066 --> 01:27:54.206]  They shut down the Internet.
[01:27:54.246 --> 01:27:56.087]  And of course, maybe we could trace it back.
[01:27:57.067 --> 01:27:57.428]  Exactly.
[01:27:57.488 --> 01:27:58.609]  Find out how to penetrate it.
[01:27:58.649 --> 01:27:59.370]  Find out who's using it.
[01:27:59.430 --> 01:28:00.430]  They just did that today.
[01:28:00.751 --> 01:28:04.694]  They found out that the ISIS social media was traced back to a British government office.
[01:28:05.415 --> 01:28:06.556]  We know what's going on.
[01:28:06.616 --> 01:28:08.278]  We know these guys are running ISIS.
[01:28:08.598 --> 01:28:13.042]  And when they talk about shutting down freedom of speech, he just repeated the exact same stuff he said in his speech.
[01:28:13.202 --> 01:28:16.145]  Even talking about how you don't refer to these people as masterminds.
[01:28:16.425 --> 01:28:19.008]  He knows precisely what he's saying.
[01:28:19.048 --> 01:28:21.430]  And he's calling on the press to be more precise on what they say.
[01:28:22.543 --> 01:28:29.569]  And they don't have any way to really shut it down, but here this is that Slate article where they're saying, ISIS gives us no choice but to consider limits on speech.
[01:28:30.109 --> 01:28:37.656]  They suggest considering a law that makes it a crime to access websites that glorify, express support for, provide encouragement for ISIS.
[01:28:38.496 --> 01:28:46.983]  So basically going to be policing people who, you never know, people all the time open up bad links, there's phishing in your emails, journalists.
[01:28:47.904 --> 01:28:48.385]  I don't know.
[01:29:03.007 --> 01:29:03.207]  Yes.
[01:29:03.387 --> 01:29:11.189]  If you're going to have freedom of speech, like any free market, you do not use the government to shut down portions of it.
[01:29:11.569 --> 01:29:14.450]  You use the free market to put your point across.
[01:29:14.690 --> 01:29:21.712]  And if we're going to take that tact, if we're going to say we're going to shut down this part of the internet over here, we're no different from China.
[01:29:22.272 --> 01:29:27.673]  And once you censor the internet, you have established the principle you will censor everything.
[01:29:27.833 --> 01:29:28.133]  Exactly.
[01:29:28.153 --> 01:29:32.037]  When a politician tells you that he's going to take away your freedom of speech, believe him!
[01:29:32.357 --> 01:29:33.218]  He's going to take it away.
[01:29:33.238 --> 01:29:34.159]  Right.
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:35.881]  It's not a fantasy.
[01:29:35.901 --> 01:29:37.342]  They lie to you all the time.
[01:29:37.703 --> 01:29:40.786]  Don't lie to yourself about what a politician is going to do.
[01:29:41.126 --> 01:29:46.611]  If he tells you he's a thief, if he tells you he's going to steal your rights, he's going to steal your damn rights!
[01:29:47.112 --> 01:29:47.973]  No question about it.
[01:29:48.053 --> 01:29:49.114]  He'll keep that promise.
[01:29:50.034 --> 01:29:51.835]  Yeah, those are one promise they actually will keep.
[01:29:52.195 --> 01:29:52.456]  Oh yeah?
[01:29:53.076 --> 01:29:56.638]  Like we said earlier on the Facebook mentions, a lot of times they'll come out here and tell you the truth.
[01:29:56.658 --> 01:29:59.300]  They just told you what the truth was, what he plans to do.
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:00.961]  And I agree with David on that one.
[01:30:01.101 --> 01:30:02.402]  I believe he means it.
[01:30:02.422 --> 01:30:04.283]  And we know, give them an inch, they'll take a mile.
[01:30:04.383 --> 01:30:05.604]  So you're absolutely right.
[01:30:05.624 --> 01:30:16.430]  And they've already let us know about a year or so ago, they pushed this internet ID, telling us how great it'll be because we can access our taxes and all our government data with our internet ID.
[01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:19.172]  That, of course, if three strikes you're out,
[01:30:19.372 --> 01:30:23.055]  You can never access the internet again if they so choose, so yeah.
[01:30:23.075 --> 01:30:25.196]  Americans have adopted the mindset of slaves.
[01:30:25.596 --> 01:30:27.818]  They want to be protected, they want to be kept safe.
[01:30:28.058 --> 01:30:33.102]  They're nothing more than the, what was it, the Moorlachs, or what was the name of the pink little things in H.G.
[01:30:33.142 --> 01:30:34.183]  Wells' time machine?
[01:30:34.203 --> 01:30:36.004]  It's the Eloi and the Moorlachs.
[01:30:36.064 --> 01:30:37.025]  Eloi, yeah, exactly.
[01:30:37.225 --> 01:30:41.208]  These are a bunch of Moorlachs, and the American people are a bunch of Eloi.
[01:30:41.788 --> 01:30:42.128]  Okay?
[01:30:42.368 --> 01:30:43.369]  They want to be kept safe.
[01:30:43.469 --> 01:30:44.450]  And you know what?
[01:30:45.725 --> 01:30:48.767]  When they talk about serving America, you're on the menu.
[01:30:49.087 --> 01:30:49.408]  Right.
[01:30:49.688 --> 01:30:50.308]  You're the food.
[01:30:50.529 --> 01:30:50.929]  Yep.
[01:30:51.109 --> 01:30:51.289]  Okay?
[01:30:51.309 --> 01:30:52.030]  It's their farm.
[01:30:52.050 --> 01:30:53.251]  They're gonna take your freedom.
[01:30:53.631 --> 01:30:54.652]  We're the cattle.
[01:30:54.832 --> 01:30:57.274]  Stop acting like cattle.
[01:30:57.354 --> 01:31:00.936]  ...public call to jihad and the Obama administration didn't target it.
[01:31:00.956 --> 01:31:09.503]  Nidal Hassan communicated with Anwar al-Awlaki, a known radical cleric, asked about waging jihad against his fellow soldiers.
[01:31:09.843 --> 01:31:12.565]  The problem is, because of political correctness,
[01:31:12.805 --> 01:31:15.027]  No, it isn't because of political correctness, Ted.
[01:31:15.347 --> 01:31:17.048]  They did this before 9-11.
[01:31:17.528 --> 01:31:20.430]  This has been the game for the last 16 years.
[01:31:20.811 --> 01:31:25.694]  They have been using the threat of terrorism to increase the Patriot Act police state.
[01:31:26.374 --> 01:31:29.056]  They let this stuff go, they know about it, and they let it go.
[01:31:29.116 --> 01:31:31.438]  This has been the tactic they've been using for 15 years.
[01:31:31.778 --> 01:31:34.280]  It isn't going to be solved by getting Obama out of there.
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:37.662]  It's going to be solved by getting control of the NSA and the CIA.
[01:31:37.742 --> 01:31:40.184]  And you're going to have to do that from outside of Washington.
[01:31:41.465 --> 01:31:45.831]  Stop bowing down to the military-industrial conflict.
[01:31:46.411 --> 01:31:49.175]  I think we got Alex ready to comment.
[01:31:49.235 --> 01:31:49.875]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:51.237 --> 01:31:51.897]  That's right, guys.
[01:31:51.957 --> 01:31:56.379]  Watching your commentary on one television in my living room and on the other, I've got CNN.
[01:31:56.399 --> 01:31:57.680]  You're doing a fabulous job.
[01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:04.523]  I guarantee you, if this was put on mainstream TV up against them, it would blow their ratings away, just because it's real teleprompter-free info.
[01:32:04.543 --> 01:32:06.044]  Nobody told you guys what to say today.
[01:32:06.064 --> 01:32:12.007]  Nobody told you what the talking point was that it's the fall of Donald Trump, like mainstream media is saying, or national security is the issue.
[01:32:12.267 --> 01:32:17.970]  Watching Governor Kasich earlier, he says the FBI couldn't stop the attackers in San Bernardino two weeks ago.
[01:32:19.144 --> 01:32:20.004]  Because of encryption.
[01:32:20.084 --> 01:32:37.490]  No, the FBI knew specifically who they were, had two agents on them, and then a task force came down from the Justice Department, this is mainstream news last week, and ordered them, ordered them to shut it down and even investigated them criminally, basically, for civil rights violations.
[01:32:38.010 --> 01:32:40.151]  So they let them in with fake visa info.
[01:32:41.091 --> 01:32:42.172]  You know, the wife, Malik,
[01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:43.800]  Same story.
[01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:45.661]  And then he just sits there and lies to people.
[01:32:46.081 --> 01:33:02.707]  This guy is the type of Republican-Democrat operative that's going to steal the election from Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, or Donald Trump with a brokered conference, brokered convention that we've been warning about, that our political correspondent out in Las Vegas, Richard Reeves, has been warning about.
[01:33:03.007 --> 01:33:05.028]  And he was bouncing off the walls three weeks ago about this.
[01:33:05.048 --> 01:33:06.608]  And then last week, I said, fine, come on air.
[01:33:06.628 --> 01:33:08.049]  But he is so right.
[01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:11.452]  I mean, this just illustrates everything that we're talking about.
[01:33:11.472 --> 01:33:13.414]  And they distract us with, we're going to protect you.
[01:33:13.434 --> 01:33:14.575]  We're going to take your rights away.
[01:33:14.595 --> 01:33:16.197]  I don't care who it is up there.
[01:33:16.517 --> 01:33:19.680]  And Ted Cruz, the one big thing against him is he wants to attack Assad.
[01:33:20.201 --> 01:33:22.203]  And he says, don't be ISIS air force.
[01:33:22.804 --> 01:33:24.065]  Don't be Al Qaeda's air force.
[01:33:25.899 --> 01:33:28.641]  Our government started this with that sovereign country.
[01:33:28.701 --> 01:33:32.983]  I mean, the people doing this bipartisanly are such incredible criminals.
[01:33:33.783 --> 01:33:36.765]  And it just absolutely, you know, sticks in my gut.
[01:33:36.805 --> 01:33:39.547]  It makes me nauseated to watch this unfold.
[01:33:40.347 --> 01:33:43.309]  So you see them really peacocking for the establishment.
[01:33:43.329 --> 01:33:45.690]  I want to bring Rex Jones in here, my son.
[01:33:46.951 --> 01:33:49.572]  He did have a shirt on earlier with the school he goes to, so I had to go take it off.
[01:33:50.432 --> 01:33:52.033]  But here he is.
[01:33:52.053 --> 01:33:52.874]  I'm going to get him over here.
[01:33:55.336 --> 01:34:02.910]  Yeah, it's amazing that we've seen all night talking about terrorism and ISIS and again it's that narrative as if they didn't have anything to do with it.
[01:34:04.039 --> 01:34:04.739]  Here's Rex Jones.
[01:34:04.759 --> 01:34:05.820]  A lot of folks know his reports.
[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:08.102]  Ten minutes ago, he was watching TV in the living room.
[01:34:08.122 --> 01:34:10.864]  Brought him back here to my office so that he could talk to folks.
[01:34:10.944 --> 01:34:12.565]  Rex, you've been watching only part of it.
[01:34:12.585 --> 01:34:14.966]  He wanted to wait until... I'm going to unbutton you here, my son.
[01:34:15.467 --> 01:34:16.828]  He's got a stop button button there.
[01:34:17.428 --> 01:34:19.649]  Rex, tell folks out there... I don't even know what your view is going to be.
[01:34:19.689 --> 01:34:20.590]  I just drug out of the living room.
[01:34:20.910 --> 01:34:21.831]  You've done some great reports.
[01:34:21.851 --> 01:34:23.852]  You write yourself at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:23.872 --> 01:34:24.733]  Talk to the crew a few minutes.
[01:34:24.773 --> 01:34:26.534]  Tell them your view of the situation.
[01:34:26.554 --> 01:34:29.396]  We'll also go back to some of the commentary and have you guys comment.
[01:34:29.957 --> 01:34:36.740]  Well, on the debate, I think that they have not been letting enough time with the people that actually want to talk about the issues.
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:41.421]  Like, I would say Trump or Carson, I don't think that they've been covering them as much.
[01:34:41.601 --> 01:34:51.425]  And they've been covering people like Rubio and Kasich that want to actually cause problems, if you look at what they're saying, and not fix what they are claiming they can't.
[01:34:51.605 --> 01:34:53.006]  Is Trump still your guy?
[01:34:54.591 --> 01:34:55.391]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:34:55.491 --> 01:34:56.612]  I like Cruz and I like Trump.
[01:34:56.652 --> 01:34:58.493]  I think that would be a good president and VP.
[01:34:59.173 --> 01:35:03.035]  Now, what did you think when I told you a few weeks ago that I was talking to Trump on the phone and he was going to be coming on the show?
[01:35:03.055 --> 01:35:03.976]  I thought it was pretty cool.
[01:35:04.116 --> 01:35:05.116]  Honestly, I thought it was pretty cool.
[01:35:05.136 --> 01:35:06.817]  Did you relate to me?
[01:35:06.977 --> 01:35:07.818]  Not at first, no.
[01:35:07.938 --> 01:35:08.718]  Have I ever lied to you?
[01:35:08.738 --> 01:35:13.021]  This is unscripted, but I mean, have I lied to you all the time?
[01:35:13.281 --> 01:35:15.842]  No, you don't lie to me all the time.
[01:35:15.902 --> 01:35:17.083]  I trust him, I trust him.
[01:35:17.423 --> 01:35:18.824]  What have I lied to you about, Rex?
[01:35:18.864 --> 01:35:19.324]  You're funny.
[01:35:21.229 --> 01:35:21.730]  I'll tell ya.
[01:35:21.870 --> 01:35:23.653]  Not since Santa Claus.
[01:35:23.853 --> 01:35:25.876]  I've never dropped out of charity.
[01:35:26.117 --> 01:35:28.380]  Seriously, you believed me when I said I was having trombone.
[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:29.422]  Yeah, I believed you.
[01:35:32.365 --> 01:35:37.307]  Well, from what I saw, I've only seen about, I'd say, a quarter of it.
[01:35:37.327 --> 01:35:38.328]  I was staying late at tennis.
[01:36:02.264 --> 01:36:09.067]  From what I've seen in the debate, I'd have to say that Kasich has gotten away with a lot of stuff that isn't accurate.
[01:36:09.568 --> 01:36:12.649]  He's just lied to the American people's face, and I think that's very disgusting.
[01:36:13.149 --> 01:36:22.354]  I think that Rubio's weak on immigration, but he's trying to make up for that by claiming that he's strong on immigration, and Cruz has rightfully attacked himself, in my opinion.
[01:36:23.374 --> 01:36:25.715]  And I think Rand Paul's getting some much-needed attention.
[01:36:25.776 --> 01:36:26.836]  I think he's doing very well so far.
[01:36:29.117 --> 01:36:30.618]  And I'd like to see more Trump and Carson.
[01:36:30.658 --> 01:36:31.459]  I can't see them at all.
[01:36:31.959 --> 01:36:32.760]  And no more Joe.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:34.861]  No, thank you.
[01:36:34.921 --> 01:36:39.044]  Now, Rex, let me just see if you've been watching your daddy and listening, because we broke this in a film in 2004.
[01:36:39.144 --> 01:36:41.265]  It was in The Guardian a year later.
[01:36:41.305 --> 01:36:43.967]  It's a fact from the McCormick-Dixton Committee hearings.
[01:36:44.007 --> 01:36:48.169]  They broke it back in the 50s and the late 40s, but it was there.
[01:36:48.189 --> 01:36:50.211]  But we broke it, made the film Endgame and others as well.
[01:36:50.551 --> 01:36:52.732]  But Marshall Law breaks it down a film four years before that.
[01:36:53.113 --> 01:36:53.753]  What do you know?
[01:36:54.173 --> 01:36:55.114]  Very nice purple on air.
[01:36:55.154 --> 01:36:56.055]  This is really tolerable.
[01:36:56.095 --> 01:36:56.375]  I agree. 13.
[01:36:59.896 --> 01:37:08.558]  What do you, healthy organic garlic though, what do you have to say, oh there's Trump, we should go back to Trump for a minute, what do you have to say about the Bush family?
[01:37:09.418 --> 01:37:16.680]  Well, I don't have much to say, they haven't really accomplished as much as they claim to have.
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:18.960]  But those are your kings and queens though, Rex.
[01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:21.661]  Jeb is a failure, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:37:21.781 --> 01:37:24.221]  Failed governor, he did not do well in my opinion.
[01:37:24.281 --> 01:37:27.222]  The big point is the Nazi, his grandfather was a top Nazi collaborator.
[01:37:28.497 --> 01:37:30.198]  I'm all big fan of Bush, he's perfectly honest.
[01:37:30.598 --> 01:37:33.740]  So he shouldn't pass the presidency back and forth between the Clintons and the Bushes like a crown?
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:35.640]  Rex, get back there and watch the debate.
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:36.481]  Great having you on with us.
[01:37:36.501 --> 01:37:38.862]  That is literally, he didn't know he was going to be in here three minutes ago.
[01:37:38.902 --> 01:37:42.744]  I saw him coming back in here and I drug him in here.
[01:37:43.324 --> 01:37:45.725]  It's kids like that that are going to make America great again.
[01:37:45.745 --> 01:37:47.606]  He is a piece of work, I tell you.
[01:37:47.666 --> 01:37:48.886]  Loves teasing his dad on air.
[01:37:49.907 --> 01:37:50.787]  He did a great job.
[01:37:50.807 --> 01:37:51.528]  He's like, sorry.
[01:37:52.964 --> 01:37:59.253]  But seriously, I'm going to let you guys go back to live coverage of Bush and Trump sparring here, and I'll come back in a little while, guys.
[01:37:59.513 --> 01:38:02.357]  It's InfoWars.com, real teleprompter free news.
[01:38:03.376 --> 01:38:08.457]  We just had one that you guys will enjoy watching rerun, Alex.
[01:38:09.117 --> 01:38:20.339]  We just had Donald Trump, when they asked him a question about coming after the family members of terrorists, he said, well, remember that George Bush put the family of Osama bin Laden onto planes and sent them out the next day.
[01:38:20.759 --> 01:38:25.460]  And then they go to Jeb Bush, and Jeb Bush says, this is why Donald Trump is not a serious candidate.
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:25.880]  Yeah.
[01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:31.981]  That's why he is a serious candidate, because he exposes the fraud and the criminal actions of this CIA family here.
[01:38:32.121 --> 01:38:32.361]  Yeah.
[01:38:33.177 --> 01:38:33.957]  That was impressive.
[01:38:35.398 --> 01:38:37.419]  And he finishes up talking about safety and security.
[01:38:37.459 --> 01:38:38.180]  Let's have another drink.
[01:38:42.796 --> 01:38:44.377]  I mean, this is why Trump is so awesome.
[01:38:44.977 --> 01:38:46.618]  I mean, he really is a wake to the New World Order.
[01:38:46.738 --> 01:38:48.719]  Supposedly behind the scenes, I'll just say that and leave it at that.
[01:38:49.079 --> 01:38:50.100]  Inside baseball, that's what I mean.
[01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:54.702]  Who else would come back like that at the Bushes and the Clintons calling them criminals?
[01:38:54.862 --> 01:38:55.583]  And the Saudis.
[01:38:55.763 --> 01:38:56.863]  Guys, go back to your live feeds.
[01:38:57.023 --> 01:38:59.765]  We've got to go back on the DVR and grab that and play that clip again.
[01:39:00.025 --> 01:39:00.845]  That is sensational.
[01:39:01.046 --> 01:39:05.408]  That's what we should write about, is that Trump brings out the fact that the Bushes protected the Bin Ladens.
[01:39:05.868 --> 01:39:12.693]  They wanted to go after him saying, you know, you want to go after the families of these ISIS members and he's absolutely right.
[01:39:12.753 --> 01:39:15.855]  Well, should we protect him like your brother did?
[01:39:15.995 --> 01:39:24.422]  Well, I mean, getting past arresting people's family members or going after them or whatever, and I'm not even endorsing that, is that Trump will come back with hardcore 9-11 truth, which is a fact.
[01:39:26.483 --> 01:39:26.804]  I think so.
[01:39:41.932 --> 01:39:44.575]  Oh, you know, it's just seeing the operation grow when I came.
[01:39:44.635 --> 01:39:56.445]  I mean, it was already pretty sizable when I came here, but, you know, just the studio that we're sitting in now, the type of coverage that we're doing right now that didn't happen three years ago with this many people, you know, with the growing crew and all that.
[01:39:56.906 --> 01:39:58.267]  So, you know, it's been a...
[01:39:59.568 --> 01:40:03.230]  It's been quite an operation, quite an aspect to see this operation grow.
[01:40:03.250 --> 01:40:07.332]  Well, we love having you, brother, and we love having Leanne and David and all the rest of the crew.
[01:40:07.372 --> 01:40:14.136]  Let's get back to this live feed as these guys spar and let you guys go back to Mystery Science debate here in this final Republican debate 2015.
[01:40:14.196 --> 01:40:19.318]  Yeah, let's get back to this live back and forth between Jeb Bush and Donald Trump.
[01:40:19.338 --> 01:40:20.119]  Let's pick it up, audio.
[01:40:20.339 --> 01:40:23.742]  We need to deal with a no-fly zone in Syria, a safe zone.
[01:40:23.782 --> 01:40:29.046]  We need to focus on building a military in the second year so that we can destroy Islamic terror.
[01:40:29.086 --> 01:40:31.588]  With Jeb's attitude, we will never be great again.
[01:40:31.648 --> 01:40:32.409]  That I can tell you.
[01:40:32.689 --> 01:40:33.870]  We will never be great again.
[01:40:41.696 --> 01:40:55.419]  When Donald Trump comes back with that 9-11 truth about how, yeah, you tell us that the Bin Laden family took down the three buildings or two planes and then you put their family on a plane the next day out, Jeb comes back and says you're not serious about that.
[01:40:55.739 --> 01:41:01.060]  Then Donald Trump comes back and he says, look, Jeb says that these people coming across the border is an act of love.
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:05.760]  He's saying the same thing about radical Islam coming across the border now, that it's an act of love.
[01:41:05.921 --> 01:41:08.081]  You see, we don't have rights in America.
[01:41:08.721 --> 01:41:11.023]  Only the people who are outside of this country have a right.
[01:41:11.043 --> 01:41:14.166]  The only right that anybody has is to come live in America.
[01:41:14.466 --> 01:41:16.949]  Presumably to live off of us, if that's what they choose.
[01:41:17.209 --> 01:41:20.452]  They can come live off of us, they can come create war in our country.
[01:41:20.692 --> 01:41:21.332]  That's their right.
[01:41:21.773 --> 01:41:23.494]  But people in America don't have rights.
[01:41:23.635 --> 01:41:25.997]  And we're not going to be safe if we take that kind of attitude.
[01:41:26.017 --> 01:41:26.837]  Let's go back to the debate.
[01:41:26.857 --> 01:41:27.458]  Ben Carson.
[01:41:27.478 --> 01:41:29.280]  They don't like me very much at that point.
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:30.781]  Could you really do that?
[01:41:31.001 --> 01:41:32.122]  Obama does it every day!
[01:41:33.203 --> 01:41:40.209]  Can you be as good a killer as Obama?
[01:41:40.229 --> 01:41:42.991]  Because Obama's bragged that he's really good at killing people.
[01:41:43.011 --> 01:41:44.872]  He said that about his drone strikes.
[01:41:44.892 --> 01:41:45.793]  I'm really good at killing people.
[01:41:52.921 --> 01:41:58.986]  If you go ahead and finish the job, rather than... It's a mercy killing.
[01:41:59.367 --> 01:42:03.010]  So you are okay with the deaths of thousands of innocent children?
[01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:05.532]  Our disposition matrix is actually an act of mercy.
[01:42:06.593 --> 01:42:15.481]  Carson, this is your opportunity to point out how Obama has been doing this notoriously.
[01:42:15.601 --> 01:42:18.684]  Killing children, bombing weddings, funerals.
[01:42:19.224 --> 01:42:23.647]  Looking the other way when Israel does that with Gaza there and 1,500 kids are killed.
[01:42:23.667 --> 01:42:23.787]  Yeah.
[01:42:46.301 --> 01:42:53.404]  I think that by arming the allies of ISIS, the Islamic rebels against Assad, that we created a safe space.
[01:42:53.424 --> 01:42:55.725]  We made that space bigger for ISIS to grow.
[01:42:56.225 --> 01:42:59.126]  I think those who have wanted regime change have made a mistake.
[01:42:59.606 --> 01:43:02.807]  When we toppled Qaddafi in Libya, I think that was a mistake.
[01:43:03.207 --> 01:43:04.608]  I think ISIS grew stronger.
[01:43:04.728 --> 01:43:06.729]  We have a failed state and we are more at risk.
[01:43:07.509 --> 01:43:12.311]  I'd like to also go back to, though, another question, which is, is Donald Trump a serious candidate?
[01:43:14.369 --> 01:43:20.133]  The reason I ask this is, if you're going to close the internet, realize America what that entails.
[01:43:20.554 --> 01:43:23.136]  That entails getting rid of the First Amendment, okay?
[01:43:23.196 --> 01:43:24.357]  It's no small feat.
[01:43:25.117 --> 01:43:32.923]  If you are going to kill the families of terrorists, realize that there's something called the Geneva Convention we're going to have to pull out of.
[01:43:33.384 --> 01:43:36.966]  It would defy every norm that is America.
[01:43:37.247 --> 01:43:37.387]  Good.
[01:43:37.407 --> 01:43:40.309]  Now they're going to have a debate on free speech.
[01:43:40.329 --> 01:43:44.172]  This is going to be good, because they'll give Trump a chance to come back and explain himself.
[01:43:44.312 --> 01:43:44.893]  Mr. Trump.
[01:43:53.829 --> 01:43:56.851]  They can kill us, but we can't kill them.
[01:43:57.491 --> 01:43:58.211]  That's what you're saying.
[01:43:58.231 --> 01:44:00.693]  You're saying you can't kill the Bill of Rights.
[01:44:00.713 --> 01:44:02.694]  I'm not talking about closing the internet.
[01:44:03.014 --> 01:44:08.837]  I'm talking about parts of Syria, parts of Iraq, where ISIS is spotting it.
[01:44:09.117 --> 01:44:10.197]  Now, you could close it.
[01:44:10.217 --> 01:44:16.881]  What I like even better than that is getting our smartest and getting our best... How are you just going to go over and tell Assad to shut down the internet?
[01:44:16.921 --> 01:44:18.001]  I don't think that's going to work.
[01:44:18.101 --> 01:44:21.003]  ISIS is coming out of Langley and London.
[01:44:21.423 --> 01:44:27.651]  It's like how China is able to block Google and Amazon from being able to do business in their country.
[01:44:28.032 --> 01:44:33.419]  And they also shut down every other type of information that comes into their people.
[01:44:33.579 --> 01:44:35.542]  Infiltrating their conversations?
[01:44:36.042 --> 01:44:36.884]  I don't think so.
[01:44:37.204 --> 01:44:37.965]  I don't think so.
[01:44:40.356 --> 01:44:49.822]  See, and this is where this is going, because people are so afraid of terrorism that they are now willing to give up their freedoms, and you have people sitting at home who are going, well, they're terrorists.
[01:44:50.162 --> 01:44:52.764]  Well, we're not talking about infiltrating their conversations.
[01:44:53.304 --> 01:44:58.407]  FISA was supposed to do precisely that, and not infiltrate the conversations of Americans.
[01:44:58.807 --> 01:45:00.428]  It's fine to infiltrate their conversations.
[01:45:00.448 --> 01:45:03.090]  They're talking about, he's talking about shutting down the Internet.
[01:45:04.315 --> 01:45:04.415]  Yes.
[01:45:04.435 --> 01:45:04.555]  Yes.
[01:45:42.081 --> 01:45:49.447]  Last February I said we needed to have people on the ground in a coalition with Europe and our allies.
[01:45:49.487 --> 01:45:51.349]  Let's go to Biggs on the Twitter station.
[01:45:51.509 --> 01:45:52.610]  Joe Biggs.
[01:45:53.451 --> 01:46:04.940]  I think it's interesting we have a president that says that we shouldn't blame all Islam on a few bad apples out there that go out and conduct these, you know, terrorist acts and massacre people.
[01:46:05.261 --> 01:46:06.822]  That we should learn to be more tolerant.
[01:46:07.202 --> 01:46:12.806]  We should bring in these refugees in mass numbers into our country and put them in our homes and take care of them and love them.
[01:46:13.066 --> 01:46:13.286]  Yeah.
[01:46:13.686 --> 01:46:14.247]  Here's the thing.
[01:46:14.267 --> 01:46:20.691]  This is coming from a president who conducts more drone strikes that do not kill high-value targets.
[01:46:20.951 --> 01:46:25.714]  They kill more civilians, which is what fuels ISIS.
[01:46:26.034 --> 01:46:29.496]  That's how you recruit people to bring them in to want to go fight for ISIS.
[01:46:29.537 --> 01:46:34.380]  When your family members are being bombed because of a supposed high-value target that there's
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:39.143]  No proof that these guys even exist, and you're killing these huge civilian populations.
[01:46:39.483 --> 01:46:42.446]  That's how you have ISIS grow and get stronger.
[01:46:42.586 --> 01:46:44.267]  And people sympathize with them.
[01:46:44.567 --> 01:46:52.013]  Then we're sitting there saying that, oh, it's racist, you know, for Donald Trump to come out and say that, oh, we should ban these guys until we vet them more.
[01:46:52.293 --> 01:46:56.415]  When we look at places like Saudi Arabia, zero refugees have been brought in.
[01:46:56.696 --> 01:46:59.317]  Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab Emirates.
[01:46:59.537 --> 01:47:02.379]  Let's talk about these guys who are saying, hey, we're not doing it.
[01:47:02.399 --> 01:47:05.360]  But no one's blaming these guys for saying no to them because guess what?
[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:06.621]  They want to vet them first too.
[01:47:06.921 --> 01:47:09.002]  But we're the bad guys because we want to stop it.
[01:47:09.202 --> 01:47:15.046]  And then we have a president that tells me that I should be more tolerant of radical Islamization, whatever you want to call it.
[01:47:15.566 --> 01:47:22.616]  But he goes out and drones these guys all over the country and then kills people for no reason when they're not even high-value targets.
[01:47:22.976 --> 01:47:29.425]  Yeah, just to tag on to what Joe said there, we saw just a few weeks ago the jet strike that blew up the hospital.
[01:47:29.465 --> 01:47:32.670]  We saw the wedding that became a funeral blowing up the wedding party.
[01:47:33.010 --> 01:47:38.374]  And I guess that's kind of what they're asking Ben Carson, are you okay killing all these innocent people basically for nothing?
[01:47:38.734 --> 01:47:42.016]  As Jones was saying, there were no high-value targets in those areas.
[01:47:42.356 --> 01:47:46.919]  It was, you know, incompetence on the part of the drone operators or the entailers.
[01:47:46.939 --> 01:47:49.401]  Yeah, go read the paper drone articles that The Intercept put out.
[01:47:49.661 --> 01:47:52.102]  That stuff is amazing material on that.
[01:47:52.402 --> 01:47:53.003]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:47:53.523 --> 01:48:04.169]  And of course that's exactly what Rand Paul had been saying, and that's what this woman who was just questioning him was absolutely incredulous that he would say that we've exacerbated the situation there.
[01:48:04.410 --> 01:48:16.877]  Look, at the very least we've created a blowback, we have radicalized people, but I think that you know as well as we know, Joe, that this is a problem that they intentionally created so they could then offer us their police state solution.
[01:48:16.977 --> 01:48:21.503]  Right, well just Saudi Arabia, they also create the terrorists, but they just don't let them in.
[01:48:21.523 --> 01:48:21.923]  Yeah.
[01:48:21.963 --> 01:48:23.425]  We create them, but we want to bring them in.
[01:48:23.445 --> 01:48:28.552]  I think if Ben Carson misses calling, he should have ran for president of the, uh, what is it called?
[01:48:28.612 --> 01:48:30.995]  The, uh, sign language team or something like that.
[01:48:31.015 --> 01:48:34.239]  Alright, we got Alex Jones calling in with a comment.
[01:48:34.299 --> 01:48:34.479]  Alex?
[01:48:35.848 --> 01:48:36.309]  That's right.
[01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:43.999]  Again, this modern fusion of low-tech at my house with you guys in the high-tech studio, giving commentary, giving analysis.
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:52.471]  With the rest of our team, we've got, of course, Richard Reeves out in Las Vegas covering the event live as well.
[01:48:53.232 --> 01:48:58.237]  And of course, this TV transmission is also being picked up by AM and FM radio stations across the country.
[01:48:58.858 --> 01:49:06.546]  So it's very, very exciting in places, like I mentioned, New York City, Austin, Texas, also places like Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[01:49:06.606 --> 01:49:07.266]  Very, very exciting.
[01:49:07.547 --> 01:49:11.791]  Shows where the dinosaur media is going versus the new, truly competitive media.
[01:49:12.231 --> 01:49:15.615]  Just commenting on Rubio and all of them wearing American flags on their lapels.
[01:49:16.144 --> 01:49:24.782]  And I get it, I like American flags, I like the Star Spangled Banner as much as the next person, but these are globalists, most of them on the stage, selling our country out.
[01:49:25.748 --> 01:49:34.075]  Who then sit around making a huge deal out of the fact that there's such patriots that are going to keep us safe.
[01:49:34.435 --> 01:49:36.297]  When the elephant in the room is what you've been talking about.
[01:49:36.937 --> 01:49:40.801]  Our criminal government funding ISIS and the rest of it as a destabilization army.
[01:49:41.081 --> 01:49:43.223]  Now they want to take a sod out in the name of responding to that.
[01:49:43.643 --> 01:49:45.745]  And again, this could only happen because of political ignorance.
[01:49:45.785 --> 01:49:48.827]  But listen, you can have the public dumbed down on these subjects.
[01:49:49.648 --> 01:49:55.811]  But who you don't have dumbed down is the general military and others that actually know who the players are.
[01:49:56.071 --> 01:49:57.612]  And that's who's so awake right now.
[01:49:57.632 --> 01:50:01.133]  And that's really a big checkmate to the establishment.
[01:50:01.153 --> 01:50:02.294]  So I'm going to throw it back to you guys.
[01:50:02.314 --> 01:50:04.395]  I'll be doing the Facebook mentions coming up in a little while.
[01:50:04.675 --> 01:50:10.678]  And I'll also be here at the end, the last 30 minutes or so after, with your post-political game commentary.
[01:50:10.878 --> 01:50:11.498]  Go ahead, David Knight.
[01:50:11.818 --> 01:50:13.839]  Alex, before you leave, I want to get your comment on this.
[01:50:13.959 --> 01:50:14.940]  It was coming up on the screen.
[01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:16.520]  I'm reading the subtitles as you're talking.
[01:50:17.081 --> 01:50:26.285]  And Carly Fiorina said that all these generals that she knows, as she mentioned, Petraeus, McChrystal, were retired because they told Obama things he didn't want to hear.
[01:50:26.605 --> 01:50:29.987]  You think that's why Petraeus and McChrystal retired, Alex?
[01:50:30.607 --> 01:50:31.548]  I know why they retired.
[01:50:32.574 --> 01:50:40.499]  Well, they retired because they were getting indicted, they were getting investigated, they were being blackmailed over the women that they were with.
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:48.385]  But yeah, we know the head of Defense Intelligence and others have quit, basically run out, and said our government runs Al Qaeda, it's wrong, we're against it.
[01:50:48.445 --> 01:50:51.747]  So, that's the big, bold situation.
[01:50:51.967 --> 01:50:54.149]  But David, you elaborate on why they really retired.
[01:50:54.429 --> 01:50:56.350]  Oh yeah, exactly what you were saying, Alex.
[01:50:56.410 --> 01:51:02.474]  We know that Petraeus was somebody who was sharing classified documents with his mistress.
[01:51:03.235 --> 01:51:05.737]  And of course, he didn't get run out by Obama.
[01:51:05.797 --> 01:51:09.039]  He got shifted from the military command.
[01:51:09.079 --> 01:51:12.961]  He got shifted over to the CIA command, and there was where he committed his crimes.
[01:51:13.082 --> 01:51:19.746]  I'm not defending Petraeus, a total globalist, but what he did compared to Sandy Berger or Hillary Clinton is nothing.
[01:51:20.647 --> 01:51:22.788]  I mean, they did go after him.
[01:51:23.268 --> 01:51:23.949]  Basically,
[01:51:25.050 --> 01:51:30.114]  Because the CIA and the Army are having an internal fight with each other.
[01:51:30.134 --> 01:51:32.036]  That's some real inside baseball right there.
[01:51:32.056 --> 01:51:34.518]  And really, at the end of the day, it doesn't even affect us.
[01:51:35.059 --> 01:51:39.363]  It just shows how they use the NSA for political persecution, political retribution.
[01:51:39.643 --> 01:51:41.205]  It's not used to protect us.
[01:51:41.565 --> 01:51:44.728]  It wasn't used to protect us from San Bernardino or the Paris attacks.
[01:51:45.028 --> 01:51:48.251]  The more surveillance we get... Al Qaeda was a couple thousand people in 2011.
[01:51:49.372 --> 01:51:49.893]  Yeah, yes.
[01:51:49.953 --> 01:51:52.275]  Okay, now in 2001 it was a couple thousand.
[01:51:52.615 --> 01:52:01.664]  Now it's turned into ISIS, hundreds of thousands, taking over the whole continent of Africa, the Middle East, everywhere, because it's a shadow army of the globalists.
[01:52:01.704 --> 01:52:04.287]  And the incredible good news is that's coming out.
[01:52:04.387 --> 01:52:06.009]  We've been vindicated.
[01:52:06.349 --> 01:52:08.932]  Back to you guys there at the InfoWars Command Center.
[01:52:09.212 --> 01:52:10.713]  InfoWars.com forward slash 2016.
[01:52:11.855 --> 01:52:12.836]  Folks, if you're watching us,
[01:52:14.397 --> 01:52:17.878]  Thank you Alex, and of course what Alex said is exactly true.
[01:52:17.958 --> 01:52:19.799]  That's the bigger context of what's going on.
[01:52:20.519 --> 01:52:29.162]  I think it's interesting in the small context of this debate to see how Carly Fiorina is perfectly willing to just play so incredibly loose with the facts.
[01:52:29.502 --> 01:52:35.004]  And she did a lot of damage to this whole Planned Parenthood expose when she played loose with the facts.
[01:52:35.324 --> 01:52:37.384]  She constantly just makes stuff up.
[01:52:37.505 --> 01:52:38.725]  It's absolutely amazing.
[01:52:39.245 --> 01:52:41.069]  Let's go to a quick commercial break.
[01:52:41.089 --> 01:52:43.293]  They're taking a break on the debate right now.
[01:52:43.914 --> 01:52:45.837]  Let's go to a quick commercial break and we'll be right back.
[01:52:46.548 --> 01:52:47.568]  BrainForce is here.
[01:52:48.108 --> 01:52:50.389]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:52:50.669 --> 01:52:58.531]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:52:59.311 --> 01:53:02.892]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[01:53:02.912 --> 01:53:05.272]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[01:53:05.632 --> 01:53:09.153]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[01:53:09.213 --> 01:53:12.334]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[01:53:12.854 --> 01:53:17.656]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[01:53:18.196 --> 01:53:20.057]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[01:53:20.397 --> 01:53:24.839]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[01:53:24.999 --> 01:53:27.020]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:29.121]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[01:53:29.281 --> 01:53:29.521]  Exactly.
[01:53:29.541 --> 01:53:33.604]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[01:53:33.844 --> 01:53:41.890]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:53:46.773 --> 01:53:51.775]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:53:52.015 --> 01:53:58.158]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:53:58.338 --> 01:54:05.321]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:54:05.641 --> 01:54:15.545]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[01:54:16.145 --> 01:54:22.089]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:54:22.309 --> 01:54:25.011]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[01:54:25.391 --> 01:54:26.852]  And adenosylcobalamin.
[01:54:27.153 --> 01:54:30.495]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:54:30.735 --> 01:54:32.356]  No needles, no injections.
[01:54:32.636 --> 01:54:34.117]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:54:34.277 --> 01:54:35.358]  Try it for yourself.
[01:54:35.478 --> 01:54:37.039]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.
[01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:42.943]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:54:54.750 --> 01:54:58.692]  You are watching the InfoWars Nightly News, which airs 7 p.m.
[01:54:58.732 --> 01:55:01.213]  Central at InfoWarsNews.com.
[01:55:01.313 --> 01:55:04.795]  And your support is helping us defend liberty worldwide.
[01:55:37.205 --> 01:55:38.306]  It's never going to get any better.
[01:55:38.706 --> 01:55:39.427]  Don't look for it.
[01:55:39.847 --> 01:55:40.968]  Be happy with what you got.
[01:55:42.129 --> 01:55:45.191]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[01:55:45.732 --> 01:55:47.393]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[01:55:47.793 --> 01:55:48.834]  The real owners.
[01:55:48.914 --> 01:55:53.438]  The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[01:55:53.818 --> 01:55:55.039]  Forget the politicians.
[01:55:55.259 --> 01:55:58.542]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[01:56:00.123 --> 01:56:00.543]  You don't.
[01:56:01.344 --> 01:56:02.325]  You have no choice.
[01:56:02.705 --> 01:56:03.626]  You have owners.
[01:56:03.946 --> 01:56:04.847]  They own you.
[01:56:06.187 --> 01:56:07.489]  They own everything.
[01:56:07.729 --> 01:56:09.351]  They own all the important land.
[01:56:09.731 --> 01:56:11.473]  They own and control the corporations.
[01:56:11.513 --> 01:56:14.978]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.
[01:56:14.998 --> 01:56:16.579]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:21.725]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[01:56:21.906 --> 01:56:23.528]  They got you by the balls!
[01:56:25.029 --> 01:56:27.150]  They want obedient workers.
[01:56:27.570 --> 01:56:29.111]  Obedient workers.
[01:56:29.371 --> 01:56:42.077]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[01:56:42.157 --> 01:56:45.398]  And now, they're coming for your social security money.
[01:56:45.859 --> 01:56:48.520]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[01:56:49.940 --> 01:56:50.821]  It's a big club.
[01:56:51.826 --> 01:56:52.646]  And you ain't in it.
[01:56:53.246 --> 01:56:55.947]  You and I are not in the big club.
[01:56:56.328 --> 01:56:58.268]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[01:56:58.908 --> 01:57:02.610]  It's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:05.551]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[01:57:05.911 --> 01:57:09.392]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[01:57:09.412 --> 01:57:13.333]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[01:57:13.353 --> 01:57:14.314]  They're not interested in that.
[01:57:14.594 --> 01:57:15.534]  That doesn't help them.
[01:57:15.914 --> 01:57:17.295]  That's against their interest.
[01:57:17.775 --> 01:57:18.215]  That's right.
[01:57:26.863 --> 01:57:30.145]  Welcome back to our live coverage of at Infowars Nightly News.
[01:57:30.185 --> 01:57:32.407]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo, Jakari Jackson.
[01:57:32.447 --> 01:57:36.810]  This is our live coverage of the December 15, 2015 debate.
[01:57:37.370 --> 01:57:47.797]  Right now as they're talking during this commercial break, they came back and they asked Ted Cruz the question, would you support keeping dictators in place rather than promoting democracy?
[01:57:47.877 --> 01:57:55.642]  And of course, as strange as that question sounds, what they're trying to do is come after him for criticizing the removal of Qaddafi.
[01:57:55.662 --> 01:57:56.623]  Because what did we get?
[01:57:57.443 --> 01:57:58.884]  An Arabic democracy in its place?
[01:57:58.924 --> 01:58:03.047]  No, what we got was a jihadi wonderland, as Rand Paul has said many times.
[01:58:03.527 --> 01:58:05.929]  And Ted Cruz defended that, I thought, very well.
[01:58:06.029 --> 01:58:13.934]  He also came back and said that removing Assad would be just as foolhardy, because we're going to wind up with exactly the same kind of chaos.
[01:58:14.274 --> 01:58:19.017]  But chaos is the goal and the intention of American foreign policy.
[01:58:19.537 --> 01:58:21.898]  If you don't understand that, you haven't been paying attention.
[01:58:22.098 --> 01:58:28.021]  You haven't been listening to General Wesley Clark talking about his planned progression of chaos throughout the Middle East.
[01:58:28.402 --> 01:58:29.522]  It suits their purpose.
[01:58:29.922 --> 01:58:32.384]  It suits their purpose to have chaos in America.
[01:58:32.664 --> 01:58:33.944]  That's why they're opening the borders.
[01:58:34.165 --> 01:58:42.729]  That's why they intend to bring people into this country who have not been vetted from these war zones where they have created all kinds of chaos.
[01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:44.774]  Let's go back to the debate right now.
[01:58:44.814 --> 01:58:50.109]  We've got Marco Rubio asking if he has any regrets supporting Obama's intervention in Libya.
[01:58:50.992 --> 01:58:55.495]  I can show you what we did in Libya, too, real quick.
[01:58:55.555 --> 01:58:56.715]  There it is, before and after.
[01:58:56.735 --> 01:58:57.596]  Yeah, there we go.
[01:58:57.676 --> 01:58:58.696]  Before and after Libya.
[01:58:58.716 --> 01:59:01.278]  We promoted democracy there.
[01:59:01.338 --> 01:59:01.798]  That's great.
[01:59:01.818 --> 01:59:04.439]  That's our after-democracy effect.
[01:59:04.459 --> 01:59:11.923]  That's the week came when we saw we died with a foreign policy put in effect.
[01:59:12.023 --> 01:59:15.485]  And then they ship them into Europe and don't promote democracy there.
[01:59:15.705 --> 01:59:18.026]  They allow them to continue with their Sharia courts.
[01:59:20.009 --> 01:59:21.509]  That's just a backwards question.
[01:59:21.529 --> 01:59:21.630]  Yeah.
[01:59:22.030 --> 01:59:23.410]  No, he's talking about... Now this is a good point.
[01:59:23.450 --> 01:59:25.671]  He's saying the moderate rebels don't exist, and that's true.
[01:59:25.851 --> 01:59:29.332]  Prime Minister Netanyahu is saying... So let's not get involved in Syria.
[01:59:29.652 --> 01:59:36.454]  Because Assad is a puppet of Iran, a Shia, radical Islamic terrorist, but at the same time... Oh, dignity!
[01:59:36.474 --> 01:59:46.057]  Prime Minister Netanyahu doesn't want to see Syria governed by ISIS, and we need to focus on American interests, not on... Thank you, let's not start...
[01:59:46.797 --> 01:59:47.898]  Don't talk about that.
[01:59:48.638 --> 01:59:50.439]  I don't understand this thing about Assad.
[01:59:50.459 --> 01:59:51.100]  He has to go.
[01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:54.222]  And what's your plan for putting someone in his place?
[01:59:54.282 --> 01:59:54.702]  Here's the deal, okay?
[01:59:54.742 --> 01:59:55.842]  You've already got him picked out.
[02:00:01.966 --> 02:00:06.512]  We got Saudi Arabia is invading and bombing Yemen, okay?
[02:00:06.533 --> 02:00:09.497]  Nobody is calling for the Saudi princes and saying that they have to go.
[02:00:09.737 --> 02:00:12.661]  Assad was not, he wasn't invading anybody.
[02:00:13.022 --> 02:00:15.645]  We created this problem with our surrogates there.
[02:00:15.966 --> 02:00:17.348]  Why does he have to go, Kasich?
[02:00:18.456 --> 02:00:21.401]  Absolutely insane.
[02:00:21.541 --> 02:00:25.106]  Oh yeah, like we stabilized Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:00:25.286 --> 02:00:29.453]  We've heard this about a coalition to stabilize these countries after we bomb them to hell.
[02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:36.961]  What was that?
[02:00:37.061 --> 02:00:39.062]  Somebody was heckling Trump.
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:08.502]  We've done a tremendous disservice to humanity.
[02:01:08.542 --> 02:01:13.044]  The people that have been killed, the people that have been wiped away, and for what?
[02:01:13.325 --> 02:01:14.785]  It's not like we had victory.
[02:01:15.166 --> 02:01:15.886]  It's a mess.
[02:01:16.246 --> 02:01:19.468]  The Middle East is totally destabilized.
[02:01:19.648 --> 02:01:22.090]  A total and complete mess.
[02:01:22.490 --> 02:01:26.472]  I wish we had the four trillion dollars or five trillion dollars.
[02:01:26.812 --> 02:01:34.137]  I wish it was spent right here in the United States on our schools, hospitals, roads, airports, and everything else that are all falling apart.
[02:01:34.637 --> 02:01:37.581]  I didn't agree with everything he said tonight, but that was a pretty good answer.
[02:01:37.641 --> 02:01:45.672]  That was a great answer, and it actually even got some applause from the Republicans, the hand-picked Republicans that got it on.
[02:01:45.692 --> 02:01:49.217]  But let's just start, let's just start with who got it wrong.
[02:01:49.417 --> 02:01:50.759]  Who really got it wrong?
[02:01:51.580 --> 02:01:55.064]  Hillary Clinton has gotten every foreign policy challenge wrong.
[02:01:55.104 --> 02:01:57.626]  The gimmicky red reset button with Vladimir Putin.
[02:01:57.686 --> 02:02:04.493]  Recall that she called Bashar... Again, this partisan hack cannot admit that George Bush got it wrong, okay?
[02:02:04.814 --> 02:02:10.059]  Donald Trump was talking about George Bush's policies as much as he was talking about Hillary and Obama.
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:11.701]  Well, there's nothing to respond to.
[02:02:11.741 --> 02:02:13.042]  People feel differently.
[02:02:13.062 --> 02:02:15.284]  I mean, the fact is Benghazi was a disaster because of Libya.
[02:02:15.364 --> 02:02:16.505]  Everything just fell into place.
[02:02:16.645 --> 02:02:18.186]  It could not have been worse.
[02:02:18.206 --> 02:02:18.947]  What do we have now?
[02:02:18.967 --> 02:02:19.587]  We have nothing.
[02:02:36.761 --> 02:02:38.983]  Just a lot of haters that want to kill us.
[02:02:39.043 --> 02:02:39.263]  We're free.
[02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:02.322]  For three years I've been saying, take the oil, take the oil.
[02:03:02.603 --> 02:03:03.663]  I didn't say just bomb it.
[02:03:03.723 --> 02:03:08.967]  I said take it and use it and distribute it so that the wounded warriors and people.
[02:03:09.367 --> 02:03:11.788]  But I've been saying this now for many years.
[02:03:11.828 --> 02:03:14.010]  Now all of a sudden everybody's saying take the oil.
[02:03:14.290 --> 02:03:15.671]  It wasn't so fashionable to take the oil.
[02:03:15.691 --> 02:03:19.854]  Obama just came out like last week and said, we've taken the oil.
[02:03:20.174 --> 02:03:26.017]  The only thing that Donald Trump got wrong about that is, yeah, we've spent three or four trillion dollars.
[02:03:26.098 --> 02:03:27.919]  We've got absolutely nothing for it.
[02:03:28.779 --> 02:03:32.121]  Except for the people running the military-industrial complex.
[02:03:32.301 --> 02:03:32.541]  Yeah.
[02:03:32.641 --> 02:03:33.782]  Except for the oil companies.
[02:03:33.882 --> 02:03:34.122]  Okay.
[02:03:34.322 --> 02:03:36.003]  The American people got nothing for it.
[02:03:36.384 --> 02:03:41.667]  But the people who foment these wars, the people who run the Democrats and Republicans... That's right.
[02:03:41.867 --> 02:03:42.667]  People lose.
[02:03:42.707 --> 02:03:43.368]  Yeah.
[02:03:43.568 --> 02:03:43.768]  Yeah.
[02:03:43.788 --> 02:03:44.548]  They're the ones who...
[02:03:45.729 --> 02:03:50.934]  Yeah, they destabilize Iraq, destroy it, and then send their cronies in to go rebuild it.
[02:03:50.974 --> 02:03:56.739]  The fact of the matter is the Middle East has been in turmoil for thousands of years.
[02:03:57.620 --> 02:04:06.348]  For us to think that we're going to go in there and fix that with a couple of little bombs and a few little declarations is relatively foolish.
[02:04:07.109 --> 02:04:08.310]  Governor Bush, Governor Bush.
[02:04:08.370 --> 02:04:11.432]  Look, I think we're focusing on... Hold on, hold on, Governor Bush, here's the question.
[02:04:12.213 --> 02:04:18.318]  You said getting rid of Saddam Hussein, in your words, was a pretty good deal, in light of what has happened in Iraq.
[02:04:18.618 --> 02:04:19.959]  Do you still feel that way?
[02:04:20.139 --> 02:04:25.043]  I do, and I think the lessons learned are that we have to have a strategy to get in, and a strategy to get out.
[02:04:25.443 --> 02:04:28.245]  Are you saying that your brother didn't have a strategy?
[02:04:29.446 --> 02:04:30.767]  And this is what the focus ought to be.
[02:04:30.807 --> 02:04:31.747]  It's not the differences between us.
[02:04:31.767 --> 02:04:32.407]  Mission accomplished.
[02:04:32.427 --> 02:04:33.188]  That was our strategy.
[02:04:33.328 --> 02:04:36.609]  Obama does not believe Americans' leadership in the world is a force for good.
[02:04:37.029 --> 02:04:41.531]  He does not believe that our strength is a place where security can take place.
[02:04:41.851 --> 02:04:42.951]  He leads from behind.
[02:04:43.352 --> 02:04:49.254]  He creates an environment that now we're creating the most unstable situation we've had since the World War II era.
[02:04:49.614 --> 02:04:56.777]  The focus ought to be on the simple fact that Hillary Clinton wants to double down on a failed foreign policy, and we need to be united to defeat that.
[02:04:57.117 --> 02:04:58.418]  Because we're going to be in a place...
[02:04:59.258 --> 02:05:00.279]  Foreign policy?
[02:05:00.639 --> 02:05:05.322]  He thinks that his brother's foreign policy was a success, not a failure.
[02:05:05.362 --> 02:05:09.024]  So he's going to double down on his brother's successful foreign policy.
[02:05:09.244 --> 02:05:13.387]  And his dad's foreign policy before that was, this time we're going to go all the way.
[02:05:13.407 --> 02:05:16.629]  Is regime change a good idea or a bad idea?
[02:05:16.649 --> 02:05:24.233]  I don't think because I think the regime change was a bad idea, it means that Hussein was necessarily a good idea.
[02:05:24.574 --> 02:05:27.716]  There's often variations of evil on both sides of the war.
[02:05:28.476 --> 02:05:32.978]  What we have to decide is whether or not regime change is a good idea.
[02:05:33.378 --> 02:05:35.359]  It's what the neoconservatives have wanted.
[02:05:35.719 --> 02:05:38.320]  It's what the vast majority of those on the stage want.
[02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:39.801]  They still want regime change.
[02:05:39.821 --> 02:05:40.861]  They want it in Syria.
[02:05:41.181 --> 02:05:42.262]  They wanted it in Iraq.
[02:05:42.302 --> 02:05:43.202]  They wanted it in Libya.
[02:05:43.582 --> 02:05:44.543]  It has not worked.
[02:05:45.183 --> 02:05:47.064]  Out of regime change, you get chaos.
[02:05:47.444 --> 02:05:51.345]  From the chaos, you've seen repeatedly the rise of radical Islam.
[02:05:51.705 --> 02:06:00.908]  So we get this profession of, oh my goodness, they want to do something about terrorism, and yet they're the problem, because they allow terrorism to arise out of that chaos.
[02:06:07.014 --> 02:06:14.242]  The question of whether we should be toppling dictatorships is asking the wrong question.
[02:06:14.302 --> 02:06:16.425]  We should be defeating our enemies.
[02:06:16.485 --> 02:06:18.907]  Senator, Senator, we're going to get to you.
[02:06:19.348 --> 02:06:19.949]  Wait your turn.
[02:06:19.989 --> 02:06:21.190]  We have two hours debate.
[02:06:21.430 --> 02:06:22.471]  We'll have plenty of time.
[02:06:22.631 --> 02:06:24.013]  Let Hugh ask his question.
[02:06:24.073 --> 02:06:25.273]  Well, but let me explain.
[02:06:25.293 --> 02:06:27.694]  The focus should be on defeating our enemies.
[02:06:27.734 --> 02:06:34.597]  So, for example, the regime we should change is Iran, because Iran has declared war on us.
[02:06:34.657 --> 02:06:42.079]  But we shouldn't be toppling regimes that are fighting radical Islamic terrorists and that are helping... These are the rules all of you agreed to.
[02:06:42.259 --> 02:06:43.460]  Hugh, go ahead with your question.
[02:06:43.900 --> 02:06:46.403]  Mr. Trump, we are talking about the most important thing.
[02:06:46.423 --> 02:06:47.124]  That's why it's heated.
[02:06:48.025 --> 02:06:51.890]  You're okay with Mr. Assad staying in power, but you're also in favor of winning.
[02:06:52.330 --> 02:06:54.413]  If he stays in power, Iran is winning.
[02:06:54.633 --> 02:06:55.815]  Hezbollah is winning.
[02:06:55.835 --> 02:06:58.478]  Iran is winning in Yemen.
[02:06:58.738 --> 02:07:00.380]  They are winning everywhere.
[02:07:00.761 --> 02:07:02.643]  If they're winning, how can we be winning?
[02:07:03.524 --> 02:07:05.066]  I think Assad is a bad guy.
[02:07:05.366 --> 02:07:06.127]  Very bad guy.
[02:07:06.147 --> 02:07:07.568]  He's been there for a very long time.
[02:07:07.588 --> 02:07:08.169]  Lots of people killed.
[02:07:08.189 --> 02:07:08.569]  His family, yeah.
[02:07:08.589 --> 02:07:09.770]  I think we're back in people we have to deal with.
[02:07:09.810 --> 02:07:10.631]  This is something new.
[02:07:10.671 --> 02:07:13.774]  It isn't like Iran just put Assad in power here.
[02:07:13.834 --> 02:07:15.315]  I mean, where is this guy coming from?
[02:07:15.396 --> 02:07:15.696]  It's amazing.
[02:07:15.716 --> 02:07:17.498]  A lot of people think that they're ISIS.
[02:07:18.318 --> 02:07:19.820]  We have to do one thing at a time.
[02:07:20.140 --> 02:07:22.581]  We can't be fighting ISIS and fighting Assad.
[02:07:22.701 --> 02:07:27.642]  Assad is fighting ISIS, he's fighting ISIS, Russia's fighting ISIS, and Iran is fighting ISIS.
[02:07:28.002 --> 02:07:29.683]  We have to do one thing at a time.
[02:07:29.923 --> 02:07:34.024]  We can't go, and I watched Lindsey Graham, he said, I've been here for 10 years fighting.
[02:07:34.044 --> 02:07:36.725]  Well, he'll be there with that thinking for another 50 years.
[02:07:37.025 --> 02:07:38.586]  He won't be able to solve the problem.
[02:07:39.426 --> 02:07:41.328]  We have to get rid of ISIS first.
[02:07:42.048 --> 02:07:44.490]  After we get rid of ISIS, we'll start thinking about it.
[02:07:44.710 --> 02:07:46.612]  But we can't be fighting Assad.
[02:07:46.932 --> 02:07:50.715]  And when you're fighting Assad, you're fighting Russia, you're fighting... You're fighting a lot of different groups.
[02:07:51.135 --> 02:07:53.918]  But we can't be fighting everybody at one time.
[02:07:53.938 --> 02:07:55.839]  Governor Christie, is he right?
[02:07:55.979 --> 02:07:56.360]  Because...
[02:07:57.040 --> 02:08:03.948]  He should have said to Hugh Hewitt, if we're beating Assad, then ISIS is winning.
[02:08:04.149 --> 02:08:08.814]  And that's basically what he said, but he could have distilled the fact that we would not be winning in our fight against ISIS.
[02:08:08.834 --> 02:08:15.182]  Well, that's what we've been doing, though, up until Trump pointed it out, is that we have been attacking Assad and helping ISIS.
[02:08:15.282 --> 02:08:17.004]  Oops, sorry, we dropped all those weapons.
[02:08:17.284 --> 02:08:20.567]  But to say that Iran is winning, no, it's ISIS is winning.
[02:08:20.627 --> 02:08:23.649]  It's like, you know, Assad is fighting ISIS.
[02:08:23.709 --> 02:08:25.351]  So let's take him out and let ISIS win.
[02:08:25.391 --> 02:08:28.173]  That's what Hugh Hewitt and the Republicans want.
[02:08:28.713 --> 02:08:41.304]  And so when we empower Iran, this is why this president and when Hillary Clinton says her theory against ISIS will be just about the same as the president, they get ready for more unrest and more murder and more violence in the Middle East.
[02:08:41.604 --> 02:08:46.088]  We need to focus our attention on Iran because if you miss Iran, you're not going to get ISIS.
[02:08:46.608 --> 02:08:50.611]  The two are inextricably connected because one... Oh, but wait a minute.
[02:08:50.771 --> 02:08:55.155]  Hugh Hewitt just said that Iran created Assad, okay?
[02:08:55.195 --> 02:08:57.496]  But then, you know, Assad is fighting ISIS.
[02:08:57.536 --> 02:09:00.999]  But now we're supposed to believe that Iran is the problem.
[02:09:01.019 --> 02:09:04.081]  You know, they can't keep their enemies straight from one question to the next.
[02:09:04.101 --> 02:09:06.383]  The issue is, David, that everybody's their enemy.
[02:09:06.483 --> 02:09:07.424]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:09:07.884 --> 02:09:18.450]  They want to take down Syria, they want to take down Iran, and they want to take down ISIS, and the fact that these guys are fighting each other, we have to have this bipolar world, and they have contradiction after contradiction.
[02:09:18.650 --> 02:09:32.317]  Well, and the fact that we know that they play chess in politics, and the fact that they believe this about Iran, and they know that with this nuclear deal, it'll be about 10 years before we're going to have to be dealing with potential nuclear warheads.
[02:09:32.935 --> 02:09:36.419]  So they're setting us up to just chaos and confusion into the future.
[02:09:37.219 --> 02:09:43.786]  Rand Paul just pointed out if we had bombed ISIS two years ago now, or Assad two years ago, then ISIS would be in charge now.
[02:09:43.826 --> 02:09:43.986]  Right.
[02:09:44.066 --> 02:09:45.988]  I can't believe they let... In charge of Iraq.
[02:09:48.302 --> 02:09:52.905]  I can't believe Hugh Hewitt is pushing this as, you know, and Chris Christie.
[02:09:53.145 --> 02:09:54.125]  We've got to get Iran.
[02:09:54.165 --> 02:09:54.405]  Yeah.
[02:09:55.166 --> 02:10:02.550]  To get ISIS because they can't make up their mind whether ISIS is allied with Iran or whether ISIS is aligned with Assad.
[02:10:03.230 --> 02:10:04.111]  It doesn't work.
[02:10:04.171 --> 02:10:06.112]  It needs to break up into three parts.
[02:10:06.152 --> 02:10:08.914]  And finally you, in regard to Syria.
[02:10:09.841 --> 02:10:19.266]  Understand that Assad is an ally of Iran who wants to extend that Shia radicalism all the way across the Middle East.
[02:10:19.446 --> 02:10:20.306]  He has to go.
[02:10:20.406 --> 02:10:21.207]  And for the Russians?
[02:10:21.727 --> 02:10:23.247]  Why does Saudi Arabia have to go?
[02:10:23.267 --> 02:10:24.548]  They want the same thing.
[02:10:24.628 --> 02:10:27.810]  I think we should have a show of hands from all the Republicans.
[02:10:27.850 --> 02:10:32.352]  Who says Assad equals Iran and who says Assad equals ISIS?
[02:10:32.372 --> 02:10:33.572]  So they can get all this straight.
[02:10:34.913 --> 02:10:42.978]  Because we just lifted all sorts of sanctions on Iran, and given them a lot of money, sold them billions of dollars in weapons, so... Ms.
[02:10:43.078 --> 02:10:49.402]  Fiorina, in November you said that you would not talk to Vladimir Putin after you were elected because you would be communicating from a position of weakness.
[02:10:49.683 --> 02:10:54.686]  Do you believe that it is feasible to not communicate with another world leader, and do you think that that also is a sign of weakness?
[02:10:55.326 --> 02:10:55.506]  Ms.
[02:10:55.546 --> 02:10:57.027]  Fiorina, as you know, U.S.
[02:10:57.067 --> 02:11:01.950]  and Russian warplanes are flying all over Syria right now, with so many lives on the line.
[02:11:02.070 --> 02:11:05.132]  Is this a good time for the United States not to talk to Putin?
[02:11:05.592 --> 02:11:08.173]  I didn't say I would cut off all communication with Putin.
[02:11:08.193 --> 02:11:12.195]  What I said was, as President of the United States, now is not the time to talk with him.
[02:11:12.215 --> 02:11:14.537]  Reagan walked away at Reykjavik.
[02:11:15.037 --> 02:11:17.138]  There is a time and a place for everything.
[02:11:17.178 --> 02:11:17.738]  Don't talk to him.
[02:11:17.758 --> 02:11:18.699]  Stick a gun in his face.
[02:11:18.919 --> 02:11:19.439]  That'll help.
[02:11:19.479 --> 02:11:21.199]  Let's go to Alex Jones from his home studio.
[02:11:21.259 --> 02:11:22.700]  He's got some breaking analysis.
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:22.900]  Alex.
[02:11:45.031 --> 02:11:46.573]  Well, sure, I'm just here watching it.
[02:11:47.033 --> 02:11:50.297]  What Governor Kasich just said is the most over-the-top crap ever.
[02:11:50.817 --> 02:11:56.183]  The West has overthrown Ukraine in elected government, moved weapons in, is saying they're getting ready for nuclear war with Russia.
[02:11:56.443 --> 02:11:58.165]  Russia has two foreign bases, the U.S.
[02:11:58.185 --> 02:11:58.605]  has almost 200.
[02:11:58.665 --> 02:12:00.868]  We're run by globalists.
[02:12:01.728 --> 02:12:03.570]  They are trying to overthrow Syria.
[02:12:03.590 --> 02:12:07.152]  They're trying to overthrow our allies, Egypt, with no connection to Russia.
[02:12:07.432 --> 02:12:08.933]  That's how crazy this takeover is.
[02:12:09.193 --> 02:12:12.115]  They're turning much of Africa over to these Wahhabist Al Qaeda groups.
[02:12:12.536 --> 02:12:15.037]  Saudi Arabia is financing this like never before.
[02:12:15.618 --> 02:12:20.341]  And then this governor, this neocon says, it's time to punch Russia in the nose.
[02:12:20.801 --> 02:12:23.423]  Yeah, nuclear power that's done nothing to us.
[02:12:23.503 --> 02:12:25.825]  This is insane rhetoric.
[02:12:26.770 --> 02:12:33.492]  It shows how out of control they are, want to act tough to Americans out there that think, you know, war is another sport or something.
[02:12:34.132 --> 02:12:35.953]  These are the people that have bankrupted us.
[02:12:36.013 --> 02:12:38.153]  These are the people that have offshored our jobs to China.
[02:12:38.413 --> 02:12:40.714]  These are the people that have offshored sovereignty.
[02:12:40.734 --> 02:12:42.254]  They're trying to collapse the U.S.
[02:12:42.474 --> 02:12:43.475]  and Russia right now.
[02:12:43.955 --> 02:12:44.435]  The U.S.
[02:12:44.475 --> 02:12:47.756]  and Russia are slated for demolition by the globalists.
[02:12:48.096 --> 02:12:50.536]  And America's corrupt, the people are corrupt, so is Russia.
[02:12:50.576 --> 02:12:51.177]  It's not perfect.
[02:12:51.437 --> 02:12:55.458]  But my God, these globalist parasites that own these neocons, this filth,
[02:12:56.258 --> 02:12:57.418]  Make me want to throw up.
[02:12:57.838 --> 02:12:59.119]  Alex, right now... And then there's Donald Trump.
[02:12:59.899 --> 02:13:00.619]  Go ahead.
[02:13:00.759 --> 02:13:06.501]  Right now, they just asked Chris Christie if he would shoot down a plane after they have a no-fly zone, shoot down a Russian plane.
[02:13:06.521 --> 02:13:07.201]  He goes, I would.
[02:13:07.341 --> 02:13:08.021]  I would shoot that down.
[02:13:08.221 --> 02:13:12.822]  I mean, this is world... This is professional wrestling... This is World War III rhetoric.
[02:13:12.902 --> 02:13:15.523]  This is World War III rhetoric by a bunch of scum.
[02:13:16.363 --> 02:13:17.904]  Yeah, let's go to this.
[02:13:43.846 --> 02:13:53.131]  ... is someone with judgment, not someone who is so reckless as to stand on the stage and say, yes, I'm jumping up and down, I'm going to shoot down Russian planes.
[02:13:53.351 --> 02:13:53.651]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:53.671 --> 02:13:55.612]  Russia already flies in that airspace.
[02:13:55.973 --> 02:14:03.076]  It may or may not be something we're in love with the fact that they're there, but they were invited by Iraq and by Syria to fly in that airspace.
[02:14:03.577 --> 02:14:12.942]  And so, if we announce we're going to have a no-fly zone, and others have said this, Hillary Clinton's also for it, it is a recipe for disaster, it's a recipe for World War III.
[02:14:13.502 --> 02:14:22.604]  We need to confront Russia from a position of strength, but we don't need to confront Russia from a point of recklessness that would lead to war.
[02:14:22.984 --> 02:14:31.465]  This is something, this type of judgment, you know, it's having that kind of judgment, who you would appoint and how you're going to conduct affairs, that is incredibly important.
[02:14:31.945 --> 02:14:40.187]  I mean, I think when we think about the judgment of someone who might want World War III, we might think about someone who might shut down a bridge because they don't like their friends, they don't want to get a Democrat.
[02:14:45.396 --> 02:14:46.357]  Touche.
[02:14:46.657 --> 02:14:47.718]  Oh, this is going to be good.
[02:14:47.758 --> 02:14:49.038]  Well, if I'll tell you what reckless is.
[02:14:49.579 --> 02:14:51.580]  What reckless is is calling Assad a reformer.
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:55.823]  What reckless is is allowing Russia to come into Crimea and Ukraine.
[02:14:56.163 --> 02:14:59.725]  What reckless is is inviting Russia into Syria to team with Iran.
[02:15:00.846 --> 02:15:04.868]  Allowing them to do that, though.
[02:15:05.028 --> 02:15:14.052]  So saying that Assad is a reformer is more reckless than saying you're going to shoot down Russian planes in an area where they've been invited.
[02:15:14.532 --> 02:15:15.053]  Right.
[02:15:15.153 --> 02:15:22.336]  I mean, it's just like the mock video when they went and asked people if they wanted to bomb Russia to maintain our superpower.
[02:15:22.596 --> 02:15:23.617]  And everyone agreed to it.
[02:15:23.637 --> 02:15:24.077]  Yeah.
[02:15:25.154 --> 02:15:27.256]  What a dangerous idiot he is.
[02:15:27.396 --> 02:15:28.837]  What a dangerous idiot.
[02:15:29.117 --> 02:15:30.098]  Commander-in-Chief, question.
[02:15:30.118 --> 02:15:35.264]  You've said that Mr. Trump is not qualified to be president because he's not qualified to deal with Vladimir Putin.
[02:15:35.524 --> 02:15:38.947]  Why are you better qualified to deal with Vladimir Putin than Mr. Trump?
[02:15:39.027 --> 02:15:41.250]  Because I, first of all, I know what I don't know.
[02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:43.151]  I know what I don't know.
[02:15:43.191 --> 02:15:46.114]  I would seek out as I have the best advice that exists.
[02:15:46.875 --> 02:15:49.237]  I won't get my information from the shows.
[02:15:49.257 --> 02:15:51.879]  I don't know if that's Saturday morning or Sunday morning.
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:53.360]  I don't know which one.
[02:15:53.861 --> 02:16:01.727]  I will seek out the best advice and I will create a strategy and I will persuade the American people... Let's hope he doesn't ask his brother.
[02:16:01.747 --> 02:16:03.949]  I've laid out a policy of rebuilding our military.
[02:16:04.570 --> 02:16:10.555]  All of the talk that we're seeing here, most of which I agree on, frankly, requires a much stronger military.
[02:16:11.095 --> 02:16:14.197]  We now have the lack of readiness for this quite scary.
[02:16:14.217 --> 02:16:19.140]  We have planes that were so weak, it's just little, you know, little Girl Scouts out there.
[02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:21.122]  The Navy has been gutted and decimated.
[02:16:21.222 --> 02:16:32.289]  Yeah, the Navy was gutted because they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a new ship that can't get more than 40 miles away from shore before it breaks down on its maiden voyage.
[02:16:32.309 --> 02:16:40.955]  I mean, that's the problem with the military, not though it's too small, that it's being run by the military industrial complex and a bunch of crony capitalists and it's gotten so corrupt.
[02:16:41.315 --> 02:16:52.587]  Well now isn't that why they didn't allow the government to be shut down this last time because they tried to take some funding away from the military and so they were like okay go ahead we'll give you the first term Democrats just don't take that money away.
[02:16:53.618 --> 02:16:55.320]  Let's listen to what he has to say.
[02:17:16.644 --> 02:17:18.105]  Santorum, good guy.
[02:17:18.525 --> 02:17:19.886]  Governor Huckabee, good guy.
[02:17:20.246 --> 02:17:22.247]  They were very nice and I respect them greatly.
[02:17:22.508 --> 02:17:31.433]  But I thought it was very unfair that virtually the entire early portion of the debate was Trump this, Trump that, in order to get ratings like this.
[02:17:31.453 --> 02:17:32.353]  But Mr. Trump, it's not CNN.
[02:17:32.374 --> 02:17:33.774]  In order to get ratings like this.
[02:17:33.894 --> 02:17:37.697]  I was on CNN last night watching... Excuse me, I think it's very unprofessional.
[02:17:37.717 --> 02:17:39.138]  But it wasn't CNN, it was me.
[02:17:39.198 --> 02:17:41.059]  I watched you last night for 16 minutes.
[02:17:41.239 --> 02:17:42.420]  I think it's very unprofessional.
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:42.900]  It's not CNN.
[02:17:43.420 --> 02:17:44.341]  It's not CNN.
[02:17:45.122 --> 02:17:46.503]  It's America's watching you.
[02:17:46.723 --> 02:17:47.044]  Okay, fine.
[02:17:47.224 --> 02:17:48.945]  It's America's watching you.
[02:17:49.526 --> 02:17:51.568]  I was mentioned so I can bring up something, I think, right?
[02:17:52.088 --> 02:17:59.616]  Look, the simple fact is, if you think this is tough and you're not being treated fairly... I wish it was always as easy as using sheets.
[02:17:59.656 --> 02:18:02.158]  He heard that from Obama, didn't he?
[02:18:02.218 --> 02:18:03.159]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:03.179 --> 02:18:07.463]  No, they're talking about having a real debate, not whether you can take it.
[02:18:07.503 --> 02:18:08.064]  You're a tough guy.
[02:18:10.135 --> 02:18:12.738]  Let's see, I'm at 42 and you're at 3, so so far I'm doing better.
[02:18:30.217 --> 02:18:35.821]  What my daughter said that I said in the beginning, all the fighting and arguing is not advancing.
[02:18:35.861 --> 02:18:36.382]  Now, now.
[02:18:36.402 --> 02:18:38.984]  It is not the way we're going to strengthen our country.
[02:18:39.024 --> 02:18:39.684]  Let's play nice.
[02:18:39.704 --> 02:18:40.705]  There's Mr. Kasich, yeah.
[02:18:40.725 --> 02:18:42.527]  We're going to strengthen our country when we come together.
[02:18:42.547 --> 02:18:45.129]  Don't you think that's going to be like a... Bleed everybody in Kumbaya.
[02:18:48.825 --> 02:18:49.985]  John Kumbaya.
[02:18:50.125 --> 02:18:58.069]  A leader has a sound program, has a good policy, and then brings people together to solve problems.
[02:18:58.469 --> 02:18:58.969]  Guess what?
[02:18:59.829 --> 02:19:08.133]  Both in Congress and balancing the budget, in an Ohio fixing the economy, and by the way, we talked about this... Why does this guy remind me of Will Ferrell?
[02:19:08.173 --> 02:19:08.373]  He does!
[02:19:08.453 --> 02:19:09.613]  Oh my goodness.
[02:19:09.633 --> 02:19:10.694]  Will Ferrell should do him.
[02:19:10.714 --> 02:19:12.094]  Except nobody knows who he is.
[02:19:15.828 --> 02:19:16.734]  Now that's all I can see.
[02:19:21.112 --> 02:19:24.233]  It's like Will Ferrell's impersonation of George Bush.
[02:19:24.293 --> 02:19:27.174]  Ladies and gentlemen, we don't have to fight all the time.
[02:19:27.334 --> 02:19:30.455]  It can be done, and we will be great when we join together.
[02:19:30.515 --> 02:19:31.115]  Thank you, you.
[02:19:31.735 --> 02:19:34.696]  Dr. Carson, Commander-in-Chief, thank you again.
[02:19:34.916 --> 02:19:41.178]  You've been the head of neurosurgery for a big hospital, you're on a lot of boards of a lot of companies, you've traveled the world, you're going traveling again next week.
[02:19:41.598 --> 02:19:47.360]  But does that prepare you to command troops from Djibouti to Japan, troops from Afghanistan to Iraq?
[02:19:48.500 --> 02:19:51.623]  The president is a wartime Caesar, okay?
[02:19:51.923 --> 02:19:53.044]  So that's the most important thing.
[02:19:53.364 --> 02:19:54.145]  Are you a Caesar?
[02:19:54.165 --> 02:19:56.547]  Has Obama been able to command the troops?
[02:19:56.707 --> 02:19:57.047]  No.
[02:19:57.168 --> 02:20:00.430]  He's been firing well-respected... Top generals.
[02:20:00.450 --> 02:20:00.891]  Yeah.
[02:20:00.971 --> 02:20:03.173]  ...and the ability to be commander-in-chief.
[02:20:04.133 --> 02:20:10.559]  But if you go back and you study the design of our country, it was really designed for the citizen-statesman.
[02:20:11.534 --> 02:20:15.839]  And we need to be talking about, where does your experience come from?
[02:20:16.619 --> 02:20:24.207]  You know, and I've had a lot of experience... What he needs to say, you know, the problem is, is that, you know, none of these guys are really qualified to run an empire.
[02:20:25.308 --> 02:20:26.449]  And we don't need an empire.
[02:20:26.689 --> 02:20:26.910]  Right.
[02:20:26.930 --> 02:20:30.533]  We need to go back to a democratic republic that's based on the Constitution.
[02:20:30.553 --> 02:20:34.157]  But as long as we got an empire, you know what, none of these guys are up to running it.
[02:20:34.197 --> 02:20:35.238]  And neither is Hugh Hewitt.
[02:20:36.219 --> 02:20:37.460]  ...than how much they talk.
[02:20:38.040 --> 02:20:45.126]  And then some people say, you're weak because, you know, you're not loud, and you're not boisterous, and you're not rude.
[02:20:45.606 --> 02:20:49.349]  But the fact of the matter is, look and see what I've done.
[02:20:49.870 --> 02:20:52.211]  And that speaks volumes about strength.
[02:20:52.452 --> 02:20:53.432]  Thank you, Dr. Carson.
[02:20:53.532 --> 02:20:56.034]  He actually broke a knife off on a guy's belt buckle.
[02:20:56.054 --> 02:20:57.015]  Remember that story?
[02:20:58.657 --> 02:20:59.918]  So look and see what I've done, you know?
[02:21:01.718 --> 02:21:02.118]  Thank you.
[02:21:11.405 --> 02:21:15.528]  You co-authored a bill with Democrats two years ago... Wait, I know what he wants to do.
[02:21:15.808 --> 02:21:17.209]  He wants to leave the borders wide open.
[02:21:17.349 --> 02:21:18.130]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:21:18.250 --> 02:21:20.872]  And of course the Democrat he co-authored it with was Chuckie Schumer.
[02:21:20.892 --> 02:21:21.272]  Right?
[02:21:21.352 --> 02:21:21.772]  Mr. Gun Control.
[02:21:21.792 --> 02:21:23.693]  Make coming to America a civil right.
[02:21:23.854 --> 02:21:24.754]  Yeah.
[02:21:24.954 --> 02:21:30.318]  Chuck Schumer is the guy who wants to have no control over the borders, but he wants to control your Second Amendment rights.
[02:21:31.019 --> 02:21:31.799]  And he works with Rubio.
[02:21:33.460 --> 02:21:34.521]  My family are immigrants.
[02:21:34.621 --> 02:21:35.861]  My wife's family are immigrants.
[02:21:35.941 --> 02:21:37.322]  All of my neighbors are immigrants.
[02:21:37.862 --> 02:21:39.683]  I see every aspect of this problem... And they put that down.
[02:21:39.703 --> 02:21:40.724]  Undocumented immigrants.
[02:21:41.144 --> 02:21:42.705]  They're illegal aliens, CNN.
[02:21:43.345 --> 02:21:46.526]  The American people don't trust the federal government to enforce our immigration laws.
[02:21:46.546 --> 02:21:47.607]  And they don't need citizenship.
[02:21:47.627 --> 02:21:49.248]  They can vote without being citizens now.
[02:21:49.268 --> 02:21:50.288]  Right, you don't even have to show ID.
[02:21:50.308 --> 02:21:51.309]  Who needs citizenship, yeah?
[02:21:51.989 --> 02:21:56.534]  They actually have better rights and benefits if they're not citizens than they do if they are citizens.
[02:21:56.614 --> 02:21:56.875]  Very true.
[02:21:56.915 --> 02:21:59.157]  Let's go to Biggs on the Twitter station, Joe Biggs.
[02:21:59.518 --> 02:21:59.898]  Oh, wide open.
[02:22:06.926 --> 02:22:12.747]  He wants to let an attack happen so he can usher in a police state and give the TSA more power, like you said before.
[02:22:13.047 --> 02:22:18.628]  He's come out time and time again saying that there's not enough security at airports, so that's what he wants.
[02:22:18.668 --> 02:22:21.969]  He wants an attack on American soil so he can usher that in.
[02:22:22.009 --> 02:22:23.289]  That's exactly what he wants.
[02:22:23.349 --> 02:22:24.049]  He's all about it.
[02:22:24.429 --> 02:22:30.170]  And I think it's hilarious that Kris Krispy Kreme's still up there, allowed to debate in this entire thing.
[02:22:30.450 --> 02:22:31.891]  That guy is completely ridiculous.
[02:22:32.111 --> 02:22:32.831]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[02:22:33.071 --> 02:22:34.311]  Let's shoot down Russian planes.
[02:22:34.571 --> 02:22:34.751]  Yeah.
[02:22:34.811 --> 02:22:35.172]  Right.
[02:22:35.312 --> 02:22:35.992]  Isn't that amazing?
[02:22:36.613 --> 02:22:44.180]  And his only response to that is like, you know, well, you know, you're saying that Assad is, you know, we should leave Assad there.
[02:22:44.200 --> 02:22:46.062]  That's more dangerous than shooting down a Russian plane.
[02:22:46.242 --> 02:22:46.383]  Right.
[02:22:46.423 --> 02:22:51.347]  He's mad because he wasn't invited to the sandbox and wasn't allowed to play with the other kids' toys.
[02:22:51.628 --> 02:22:53.890]  So now he wants to go in there and start shooting people.
[02:22:54.090 --> 02:23:05.175]  We get a bunch of these teleprompter tough guys, they can get up here and talk tough, and even if they do decide to go through with these plans to blow up these planes, they're going to be sitting in the White House, you know, watching CNN.
[02:23:05.195 --> 02:23:08.297]  They're not going to have boots on the ground actually having to deal with consequences.
[02:23:08.657 --> 02:23:10.378]  Well, don't forget it started with Carly Fiorina.
[02:23:10.418 --> 02:23:12.059]  She was the one who said, I wouldn't talk to him.
[02:23:12.419 --> 02:23:13.699]  I just wouldn't talk to him, you know?
[02:23:13.819 --> 02:23:15.300]  He was next action and strength.
[02:23:17.421 --> 02:23:18.961]  He's so rude, I'm just not going to talk to him.
[02:23:19.021 --> 02:23:24.583]  So, she's going to, you know, put loaded guns in his face and then they take it from there to the no-fly zone, shooting down planes.
[02:23:24.603 --> 02:23:25.623]  It's the logical extension.
[02:23:25.643 --> 02:23:29.445]  Alright, let's go back to the debate.
[02:23:30.345 --> 02:23:30.725]  Thank you, Joe.
[02:23:30.745 --> 02:23:31.345]  Thank you, Senator.
[02:23:31.365 --> 02:23:32.285]  Thank you, Senator.
[02:23:32.385 --> 02:23:33.766]  Senator Cruz.
[02:23:33.786 --> 02:23:42.969]  Senator Cruz, on the campaign trail, Senator Rubio has said that his immigration plan isn't that different from yours.
[02:23:42.989 --> 02:23:44.029]  Is that true?
[02:23:45.040 --> 02:24:02.556]  Well, he has attempted to muddy the waters, but I think anyone that watched the battle that we had, you know, there was a time for choosing, as Reagan put it, where there was a battle over amnesty, and some chose, like Senator Rubio, to stand with Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer and support a massive amnesty plan.
[02:24:03.337 --> 02:24:09.259]  Others chose to stand with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and the American people and secure the border.
[02:24:09.279 --> 02:24:20.283]  And let me mention, this issue is actually directly connected to what we've been talking about, because the front line with ISIS isn't just in Iraq and Syria, it's also in Kennedy Airport and the Rio Grande.
[02:24:20.443 --> 02:24:23.024]  Border security is national security.
[02:24:23.344 --> 02:24:27.666]  And you know, one of the most troubling aspects of the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight bill,
[02:24:28.266 --> 02:24:28.987]  We're good to go.
[02:24:49.742 --> 02:24:51.384]  We will secure the border.
[02:24:51.745 --> 02:24:53.607]  We will triple the Border Patrol.
[02:24:53.647 --> 02:24:58.052]  We will build a wall that works, and I'll get Donald Trump to pay for it.
[02:25:03.901 --> 02:25:05.603]  Yeah, a couple points.
[02:25:05.703 --> 02:25:08.705]  In 2013, we had never faced a crisis like the Syrian refugee crisis now.
[02:25:09.206 --> 02:25:12.789]  Up until that point, a refugee made someone fleeing oppression, fleeing communism.
[02:25:13.049 --> 02:25:14.811]  That's somebody fleeing our foreign policy.
[02:25:14.831 --> 02:25:16.032]  Good point.
[02:25:16.092 --> 02:25:17.853]  Everyone wants to talk about that.
[02:25:18.053 --> 02:25:21.176]  Ted, you support legalizing people who are in this country illegally.
[02:25:21.777 --> 02:25:27.461]  Ted Cruz supported a 500% increase in the number of... Let's get Alex Jones from his home studio.
[02:25:27.481 --> 02:25:28.622]  He's got some breaking analysis.
[02:25:28.702 --> 02:25:28.883]  Alex.
[02:25:30.330 --> 02:25:35.852]  Well, both Republican and Democratic parties want open borders for cheap labor to drive down wages and create balkanization.
[02:25:36.372 --> 02:25:37.693]  This country was built on immigrants.
[02:25:37.713 --> 02:25:40.174]  I don't care where you come from, as long as you're pro-free market.
[02:25:40.494 --> 02:25:42.795]  They're bringing them in to turn them into a political group.
[02:25:43.155 --> 02:25:47.657]  Whether they're from Germany or Mexico, about 95% vote Democrat, anti-gun.
[02:25:48.277 --> 02:25:49.138]  And that's the admission.
[02:25:49.178 --> 02:25:50.279]  The group's brag.
[02:25:50.939 --> 02:25:56.704]  I mean, they got all these LaRosa guys, like the Deputy Mayor in Austin, saying, yeah, we're going to get the votes to take your guns.
[02:25:56.744 --> 02:25:57.725]  Yes, we will confiscate.
[02:25:58.285 --> 02:26:02.749]  So let's just be honest about the plan here and what's going on.
[02:26:02.809 --> 02:26:05.571]  Bringing in more people now drives down our wages.
[02:26:05.631 --> 02:26:11.536]  NAFTA, GATT, WTO, the TPP is written by the globalists as a screw job.
[02:26:12.136 --> 02:26:13.297]  Time for real free trade.
[02:26:13.617 --> 02:26:15.539]  If we didn't have welfare, I'd say just have open borders.
[02:26:15.999 --> 02:26:16.960]  Other than security checks.
[02:26:17.921 --> 02:26:32.596]  But you can't then have open borders, and ship the illegals in, and ship the terrorists in, and then take my rights at the airport, try to grab my genitals, or my daughter's genitals, or my son's genitals, or look under my hat because Al-Qaeda might be hiding under it, then Mojave walk right through with their headdresses on, their burqas.
[02:26:33.417 --> 02:26:36.121]  And then tell us we're going to accept their culture, and then they're not even searched.
[02:26:36.661 --> 02:26:39.505]  So this is political correctness, the suspension of common sense.
[02:26:39.525 --> 02:26:41.767]  I'm going to throw it back to you guys to finish up the debate.
[02:26:42.008 --> 02:26:43.109]  No, it's about to end in a few minutes.
[02:26:43.129 --> 02:26:46.994]  You'll have at least 30 minutes of live, breakdown, teleprompter-free analysis.
[02:26:47.314 --> 02:26:52.500]  This is InfoWars, the house that patriots from all political spectrums who love freedom built.
[02:26:53.061 --> 02:26:56.663]  I want to salute everyone for helping build the InfoWars News Center.
[02:26:57.024 --> 02:27:03.247]  I want to invite you all to continue to help spread the word about InfoWars.com and the video feeds, the podcast and more.
[02:27:03.508 --> 02:27:09.992]  Turn it back over to David Knight and of course the rest of the great crew there at the InfoWars News Center in Austin, Texas.
[02:27:10.643 --> 02:27:11.243]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:27:11.283 --> 02:27:14.685]  And of course, they're going back and forth about, again, immigration.
[02:27:14.725 --> 02:27:19.107]  The only two topics of the night really have been ISIS and open borders.
[02:27:19.207 --> 02:27:24.230]  And as Alex is pointing out, it really is about selecting the voters.
[02:27:24.290 --> 02:27:31.413]  They have used, one of the games that they use in elections has always been gerrymandering, where they go down and select the voters to create a Democrat or Republican district.
[02:27:31.894 --> 02:27:37.516]  Now they can't do that enough, so they're going to bring in voting blocs from outside the country.
[02:27:37.556 --> 02:27:38.537]  But of course, they also want
[02:27:38.917 --> 02:27:40.137]  Chaos in this country.
[02:27:40.197 --> 02:27:43.038]  That's what this massive importation of people from Syria is about.
[02:27:43.058 --> 02:27:44.138]  Let's go back to the debate.
[02:27:44.338 --> 02:27:47.739]  You like to say that you restarted this conversation in the campaign?
[02:27:47.759 --> 02:27:48.319]  I think I did.
[02:27:48.679 --> 02:27:50.180]  So who do you side with?
[02:27:50.540 --> 02:27:51.760]  Who do you side with in this?
[02:27:51.960 --> 02:27:53.020]  Senator Rubio or Senator Cruz?
[02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:54.741]  I have a very hardline position.
[02:27:54.801 --> 02:27:57.321]  We have a country or we don't have a country.
[02:27:57.721 --> 02:27:59.942]  People that have come into our country illegally
[02:28:00.362 --> 02:28:00.962]  They have to go.
[02:28:01.022 --> 02:28:03.063]  They have to come back in through a legal process.
[02:28:03.383 --> 02:28:04.384]  I want a strong border.
[02:28:04.464 --> 02:28:05.164]  I do want a wall.
[02:28:05.224 --> 02:28:05.864]  Walls do work.
[02:28:05.884 --> 02:28:08.125]  You just have to speak to the folks in Israel.
[02:28:08.165 --> 02:28:08.786]  Walls work.
[02:28:09.206 --> 02:28:11.347]  If they're properly constructed, I know how to build.
[02:28:11.867 --> 02:28:12.968]  Believe me, I know how to build.
[02:28:13.768 --> 02:28:19.490]  But I feel a very, very strong bind and really I'm bound to this country.
[02:28:19.771 --> 02:28:21.391]  We either have a border or we don't.
[02:28:21.691 --> 02:28:23.172]  People can come into the country.
[02:28:23.232 --> 02:28:26.454]  We welcome people to come in, but they have to come in legally.
[02:28:27.074 --> 02:28:27.414]  Thank you.
[02:28:27.694 --> 02:28:29.375]  Governor Bush, listening to this,
[02:28:30.765 --> 02:28:37.391]  Do you think this is the tone, this immigration debate, that Republicans need to take to win back Hispanics?
[02:28:37.971 --> 02:28:39.693]  We have to love them.
[02:28:39.873 --> 02:28:41.915]  We have to love the Islamics.
[02:28:41.935 --> 02:28:43.817]  That's what it's about.
[02:28:44.397 --> 02:28:50.042]  No, it isn't, but it's an important subject to talk about for sure, and I think people have good ideas on this.
[02:28:50.602 --> 02:28:52.164]  Clearly, we need to secure the border.
[02:28:52.324 --> 02:28:55.467]  Coming here legally needs to be a lot easier than coming here illegally.
[02:28:55.487 --> 02:28:57.629]  If you don't have that, you don't have the rule of law.
[02:28:58.229 --> 02:29:01.571]  We now have a national security consideration, public health issues.
[02:29:01.611 --> 02:29:06.133]  We have an epidemic of heroin overdoses in all sorts, all places in this country.
[02:29:06.153 --> 02:29:07.514]  Yeah, but that's because of prohibition.
[02:29:07.574 --> 02:29:08.955]  It isn't because of the borders, okay?
[02:29:08.975 --> 02:29:09.795]  We have to secure the borders.
[02:29:09.835 --> 02:29:11.896]  Because the war on drugs for 44 years.
[02:29:12.296 --> 02:29:14.157]  And yeah, we do need more fencing.
[02:29:14.317 --> 02:29:15.918]  And we do need to use technology.
[02:29:16.038 --> 02:29:17.579]  And we do need more border control.
[02:29:17.739 --> 02:29:21.464]  And we need to have better cooperation, by the way, with local law enforcement.
[02:29:21.744 --> 02:29:23.947]  There are 800,000 cops on the beat.
[02:29:24.287 --> 02:29:30.655]  They ought to be trained to be the eyes and ears for law enforcement, for the threat against terror, as well as for immigration.
[02:29:30.675 --> 02:29:32.337]  And we need them under federal control, don't we?
[02:29:32.377 --> 02:29:32.858]  Yes, pretty much.
[02:29:34.339 --> 02:29:36.141]  Yeah, we'll start winning votes again.
[02:29:36.541 --> 02:29:38.963]  The real problem isn't anybody on this stage.
[02:29:39.503 --> 02:29:45.668]  The real problem is Barack Obama has had six years to advocate a position to fix this, and he's done nothing.
[02:29:45.889 --> 02:29:51.133]  The Congress has funded these programs of building more fencing and doing all this, and he hasn't done it.
[02:29:51.233 --> 02:29:54.175]  He wants to maintain it as a wedge issue, and so does Hillary Clinton.
[02:29:55.096 --> 02:29:57.358]  Congress hasn't done anything about this.
[02:29:57.398 --> 02:29:58.739]  They could have stopped the funding.
[02:30:01.124 --> 02:30:02.945]  They could have shut down the executive orders.
[02:30:03.025 --> 02:30:04.687]  They have absolutely been AWOL on this.
[02:30:04.707 --> 02:30:05.667]  Well, he hands over all their power.
[02:30:18.797 --> 02:30:22.600]  I talked to the Syrians themselves, and I asked them, what do you want?
[02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:24.761]  What is your supreme desire?
[02:30:25.121 --> 02:30:28.604]  Their supreme desire was to be settled back in their own country.
[02:30:29.084 --> 02:30:31.385]  I said, what can Americans and other countries do?
[02:30:31.766 --> 02:30:38.911]  They said, support the efforts of those who are trying to provide safety for us, including the Jordanians.
[02:30:38.971 --> 02:30:44.474]  Of course, they had a brand new hospital, for instance, that was unstaffed because there wasn't enough money to do it.
[02:30:44.895 --> 02:30:46.155]  But here's what's really neat.
[02:30:47.397 --> 02:30:55.428]  If you go into Hasakah Province in northeastern Syria, that's an area that's as big as Lebanon.
[02:30:55.929 --> 02:30:59.054]  It's controlled by the Kurds, the Christians, and the moderate Sunnis.
[02:30:59.975 --> 02:31:02.038]  And there are airstrips and hotels.
[02:31:02.759 --> 02:31:04.880]  Yeah, I'm a little hesitant to give any country a bunch of arms.
[02:31:22.071 --> 02:31:23.752]  We have a perfect ideal there.
[02:31:24.032 --> 02:31:33.875]  We don't need to set this up as we either take a bunch of refugees who will be infiltrated with terrorists, I guarantee you, for them not to be terrorist malpractice.
[02:31:43.619 --> 02:31:45.901]  At this time into the United States, the U.S.
[02:31:45.921 --> 02:31:52.507]  has already accepted 2,000 Syrian refugees, including 13 living here in Las Vegas right now.
[02:31:52.927 --> 02:31:54.088]  Would you send them back?
[02:31:54.168 --> 02:31:55.430]  What would you do with these people?
[02:31:56.210 --> 02:32:01.375]  You know, I think we need to set the record straight on this, because I think Marco misspoke about the bill.
[02:32:01.875 --> 02:32:08.521]  On the Gang of Eight bill, there was no provisions really for extra scrutiny or safety for refugees.
[02:32:08.982 --> 02:32:10.243]  At the time the bill came up,
[02:32:10.723 --> 02:32:14.067]  Two Iraqi refugees came to my hometown, Bowling Green, Kentucky.
[02:32:14.427 --> 02:32:16.950]  Their fingerprints were on a bomb from Iraq.
[02:32:16.990 --> 02:32:19.112]  They were in the database, but we didn't pick them up.
[02:32:19.633 --> 02:32:26.059]  We relocated them here, put them in government housing, got them on food stamps, and we began providing for them, but we didn't have adequate security.
[02:32:26.580 --> 02:32:28.822]  On the Gang of Eight bill, on Marco's bill,
[02:32:29.463 --> 02:32:30.544]  We had an opportunity.
[02:32:30.584 --> 02:32:41.594]  There was a conservative consensus for an amendment I put forward called Trust but Verify that would have strengthened border security on both refugees, students, and those coming here.
[02:32:42.214 --> 02:32:48.220]  And Marco sided and was, I guess, more sympathetic to Chuck Schumer and to the President than he was to conservative principals.
[02:32:48.540 --> 02:32:50.362]  But this goes directly to national defense.
[02:32:50.382 --> 02:32:51.983]  Because he's part of the...
[02:32:53.064 --> 02:32:56.447]  Bipartisan establishment that wants open borders.
[02:32:56.747 --> 02:32:58.949]  That's what Rubio represents.
[02:32:58.989 --> 02:33:02.212]  That's why he would oppose any verification of people.
[02:33:02.492 --> 02:33:03.372]  Trust but verify.
[02:33:04.813 --> 02:33:06.993]  Because they messed up in how they used the actual database.
[02:33:07.013 --> 02:33:10.154]  They should have known they didn't, because they didn't run the actual law as it exists now.
[02:33:10.474 --> 02:33:11.234]  It didn't work well.
[02:33:11.794 --> 02:33:15.735]  As far as the refugees are concerned, it's not that America doesn't want to accept refugees, Wolf.
[02:33:16.355 --> 02:33:19.756]  It's that we may not be able to, because this is an issue we have to be 100% right on.
[02:33:20.236 --> 02:33:29.138]  If we allow 9,999 Syrian refugees into the United States, and all of them are good people, but we allow one person in who's an ISIS killer, we just get one person wrong.
[02:33:29.798 --> 02:33:30.979]  We got a serious problem.
[02:33:31.239 --> 02:33:37.124]  And there is not a single person in the national defense apparatus of this country that can guarantee you we're going to be 100% right.
[02:33:37.424 --> 02:33:39.646]  And that's why, as president, I'll take this very seriously.
[02:33:39.886 --> 02:33:45.571]  Senator Paul, you didn't answer the question about the 2,000 Syrian refugees who are already here in the United States.
[02:33:46.031 --> 02:33:48.013]  Will you send them back or let them stay?
[02:33:48.553 --> 02:34:02.086]  What my bill would do would be only for refugees going forward, so I haven't taken a position on sending anyone home, but I have taken the position that we have a lot of problems here in our country, and that one of the things that we do, charity is about giving your own money.
[02:34:02.186 --> 02:34:03.988]  Charity isn't giving someone else's money.
[02:34:04.268 --> 02:34:09.313]  To put everyone on government housing and food stamps and bring them in from around the world, I think is a mistake.
[02:34:09.614 --> 02:34:10.695]  To give of your own money,
[02:34:11.255 --> 02:34:12.216]  I've given to my church.
[02:34:12.276 --> 02:34:14.338]  My church has helped people that came from Bosnia.
[02:34:14.579 --> 02:34:15.340]  That's a good thing.
[02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:20.445]  But we shouldn't have a program where we just say that we're going to take care of the world's refugees.
[02:34:21.005 --> 02:34:22.907]  Nobody in the Middle East is doing anything.
[02:34:22.927 --> 02:34:26.912]  Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, all the Gulf nations are doing nothing.
[02:34:27.012 --> 02:34:28.754]  They need to step up and take care of the refugees.
[02:34:28.774 --> 02:34:29.755]  We have another question.
[02:34:30.235 --> 02:34:32.778]  We have another question from Facebook.
[02:34:32.878 --> 02:34:33.378]  Let's listen.
[02:34:34.239 --> 02:34:34.480]  Yeah.
[02:34:34.820 --> 02:34:36.142]  My name is Carla Hernandez.
[02:34:36.443 --> 02:34:38.486]  I'm from the University of Texas at Austin.
[02:34:38.986 --> 02:34:40.909]  And my question is directed to all the candidates.
[02:34:41.550 --> 02:34:48.580]  If the Bible clearly states that we need to embrace those in need and not fear, how can we justify not accepting refugees?
[02:34:49.281 --> 02:34:50.241]  He just explained that.
[02:34:50.441 --> 02:34:53.782]  The difference between an individual charity and a government program.
[02:34:54.203 --> 02:34:55.023]  Right.
[02:34:55.063 --> 02:34:58.144]  Graham already addressed that.
[02:34:58.184 --> 02:34:58.584]  That's the thing.
[02:34:58.604 --> 02:35:07.127]  You want to come after people for not paying their taxes, but then you don't get angry with the government that steals your taxes and gives them away to willy-nilly to whoever they want.
[02:35:07.147 --> 02:35:08.487]  Safety, safety, safety.
[02:35:08.507 --> 02:35:09.027]  Mr. Safety Man.
[02:35:12.268 --> 02:35:14.230]  Now, listen, I'm a former federal prosecutor.
[02:35:14.391 --> 02:35:15.352]  I know Jim Comey.
[02:35:15.412 --> 02:35:16.213]  We've worked together.
[02:35:16.493 --> 02:35:17.074]  He was the U.S.
[02:35:17.114 --> 02:35:18.575]  Attorney in Manhattan when I was the U.S.
[02:35:18.615 --> 02:35:19.496]  Attorney in New Jersey.
[02:35:19.516 --> 02:35:27.605]  And when Jim Comey gets up before Congress and says, we cannot effectively vet these people, for me as President, that's the end of the conversation.
[02:35:28.546 --> 02:35:30.629]  We have to put America's security first.
[02:35:31.089 --> 02:35:33.091]  The American people...
[02:35:34.059 --> 02:35:38.082]  The bottom line is, is that the Bible does not say, create a welfare system.
[02:35:38.442 --> 02:35:38.642]  Okay?
[02:35:38.662 --> 02:35:40.403]  The Bible says, help people yourself.
[02:35:40.823 --> 02:35:42.945]  And that's precisely what Rand Paul was talking about.
[02:35:42.965 --> 02:35:47.828]  I thought that was such a good quote from Rand Paul, because that's something everybody gets, or so many people get wrong.
[02:35:48.208 --> 02:35:52.131]  Because they want to force it upon you to give out of your own pocket.
[02:35:52.651 --> 02:35:58.475]  And it's not like, like somebody said, if you want to bring everybody in, send them to the White House, send them to your Chicago mansion, all this stuff.
[02:35:58.815 --> 02:36:01.256]  You take the initiative and show people how it's done.
[02:36:01.596 --> 02:36:07.877]  Don't force these issues onto other people that have nothing to do with your foreign policy that's bringing people here in the first place.
[02:36:07.977 --> 02:36:08.337]  Right.
[02:36:08.457 --> 02:36:09.217]  Absolutely right.
[02:36:09.337 --> 02:36:12.898]  You don't practice charity with other people's money.
[02:36:12.978 --> 02:36:16.899]  You do it yourself and that way you're going to find the people who really need it.
[02:36:17.819 --> 02:36:22.140]  Instead of letting people who don't need it come in and act as thieves.
[02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:25.400]  That's the beauty of individual acts of charity.
[02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:28.081]  And they can't distinguish between charity and socialism.
[02:36:29.101 --> 02:36:34.886]  Holding a gun to somebody's head and saying, you know, give this money to a third party, which gets sticky fingers.
[02:36:35.346 --> 02:36:39.730]  And we've been very effective with our Joint Terrorism Task Force being able to make busts.
[02:36:39.790 --> 02:36:46.275]  In fact, we just made one three, four weeks ago against a person who was favorable to ISIS living in Akron.
[02:36:46.675 --> 02:36:49.197]  But let me tell you what's interesting about the administration.
[02:36:49.917 --> 02:36:55.978]  We had Central American miners that were placed in Ohio, and we never knew a thing about it.
[02:36:55.998 --> 02:36:57.459]  We didn't know where they were.
[02:36:57.959 --> 02:37:03.500]  And in fact, we know now that some of them, there is a case going on where some of them may have been human trafficked.
[02:37:03.920 --> 02:37:08.421]  So when the administration tells me we have a great vetting process... Some of them may have been part of a drug cartel.
[02:37:08.461 --> 02:37:15.383]  Because when they talk about miners, I mean, they're bringing in a lot of people in the drug cartels that they've created that are miners.
[02:37:17.023 --> 02:37:17.163]  Mm-hmm.
[02:37:56.664 --> 02:37:57.685]  BrainForce is here.
[02:37:58.205 --> 02:38:00.486]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:38:00.766 --> 02:38:08.630]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:38:09.410 --> 02:38:12.992]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[02:38:13.012 --> 02:38:15.373]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:38:15.734 --> 02:38:19.255]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:38:19.295 --> 02:38:22.437]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:38:22.937 --> 02:38:27.740]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:30.141]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[02:38:30.501 --> 02:38:34.944]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:38:35.084 --> 02:38:37.125]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:38:37.745 --> 02:38:39.206]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:38:39.366 --> 02:38:39.606]  Exactly.
[02:38:39.626 --> 02:38:43.407]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:38:43.947 --> 02:38:51.230]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:38:51.510 --> 02:38:51.970]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[02:38:56.858 --> 02:39:01.879]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:39:02.119 --> 02:39:08.240]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:39:08.420 --> 02:39:15.402]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[02:39:15.742 --> 02:39:25.644]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[02:39:26.244 --> 02:39:32.168]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:39:32.408 --> 02:39:36.951]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:39:37.232 --> 02:39:40.574]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:39:40.834 --> 02:39:42.455]  No needles, no injections.
[02:39:42.715 --> 02:39:44.216]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:39:44.376 --> 02:39:45.477]  Try it for yourself.
[02:39:45.577 --> 02:39:47.158]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[02:40:12.735 --> 02:40:13.235]  Good evening.
[02:40:13.655 --> 02:40:25.523]  The television and radio stations of the United States and their affiliated stations are proud to provide facilities for a discussion of issues in the current political campaign by the two major candidates for the presidency.
[02:40:26.152 --> 02:40:29.053]  The candidates need no introduction.
[02:40:29.093 --> 02:40:34.253]  At center stage, businessman Donald Trump.
[02:40:35.714 --> 02:40:39.134]  Texas Senator Ted Cruz.
[02:40:41.735 --> 02:40:43.735]  Neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson.
[02:40:47.556 --> 02:40:53.057]  Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.
[02:40:53.097 --> 02:40:54.737]  Florida Senator Marco Rubio.
[02:40:58.298 --> 02:40:59.731]  Chris Christie, come on out here!
[02:41:12.910 --> 02:41:14.271]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:41:14.531 --> 02:41:15.832]  You can't survive without it.
[02:41:16.032 --> 02:41:16.933]  But where do you get it?
[02:41:17.233 --> 02:41:22.997]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand-new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:41:23.217 --> 02:41:28.961]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:41:29.121 --> 02:41:36.886]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities.
[02:41:39.648 --> 02:41:45.994]  Including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:41:46.395 --> 02:41:48.517]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:41:48.857 --> 02:41:50.058]  Stainless steel construction.
[02:41:50.339 --> 02:41:51.119]  Easy assembly.
[02:41:51.380 --> 02:41:52.000]  Low maintenance.
[02:41:52.300 --> 02:41:54.122]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[02:42:13.189 --> 02:42:19.711]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News live coverage of the December 15, 2015 GOP debate.
[02:42:19.811 --> 02:42:24.792]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo, Jakari Jackson, and we're going to go to Joe Biggs at the Twitter station.
[02:42:24.832 --> 02:42:25.032]  Joe.
[02:42:25.882 --> 02:42:32.327]  Well I think tonight's been pretty interesting to actually see Rand Paul finally in a position where he really looks comfortable.
[02:42:32.687 --> 02:42:41.733]  He's come out swinging, he's got really good answers, he's buttoned in a little bit more, he's really controlling I think the entire, you know, environment tonight.
[02:42:42.074 --> 02:42:43.755]  You know, Trump is
[02:42:44.315 --> 02:42:45.635]  Really not doing much at all.
[02:42:45.655 --> 02:42:46.916]  I think he's very lackluster.
[02:42:46.936 --> 02:42:48.136]  It's really boring.
[02:42:48.496 --> 02:42:52.037]  It seems like Donald Trump's really lost his tongue in this whole debate.
[02:42:52.057 --> 02:42:59.039]  I mean, as we've seen debate progress, you know, debate after debate, it seems like he's just gone down as it comes with that attitude.
[02:42:59.320 --> 02:43:01.440]  He doesn't have that motivation like we've seen before.
[02:43:01.720 --> 02:43:05.862]  And what I've been looking for thus far is for Rand Paul to actually come out swinging.
[02:43:06.162 --> 02:43:06.882]  And he's done that.
[02:43:07.222 --> 02:43:09.723]  He's slapped Chris Christie a few times.
[02:43:10.163 --> 02:43:12.444]  And it's looking really good for Rand Paul tonight, I believe.
[02:43:12.484 --> 02:43:13.264]  But I just got on the
[02:43:14.224 --> 02:43:20.227]  Drudge report, polls so far, they still have Trump in the lead, they've got Cruz behind that, and then they have Rand Paul.
[02:43:20.867 --> 02:43:22.568]  Yeah, you know, I think, I agree with you.
[02:43:22.588 --> 02:43:30.972]  I think Rand Paul's had an exceptional night tonight, especially staying on focus on the issues, especially the back and forth with Chris Christie, saying, are you serious?
[02:43:31.052 --> 02:43:34.634]  Are you seriously saying that you're going to shoot down a Russian plane and start World War III?
[02:43:35.014 --> 02:43:36.715]  I mean, he nailed him with that.
[02:43:37.035 --> 02:43:40.957]  But I do think that Trump had a good back and forth with Jeb Bush.
[02:43:41.397 --> 02:43:54.651]  When he talked about 9-11, when he talked about the fact that the Bushes sent the Bin Laden family home, and then Jeb came back and said, that's why you're not a serious candidate, because you would question and expose stuff like that.
[02:43:54.671 --> 02:43:56.834]  You can't be a serious candidate and tell the truth.
[02:43:57.575 --> 02:43:58.996]  That's right, that's right.
[02:43:59.036 --> 02:44:03.261]  We need to find out more about what Kasich's daughter thinks about politics.
[02:44:03.861 --> 02:44:05.623]  I'm really interested in what she's doing.
[02:44:05.984 --> 02:44:17.196]  As a matter of fact, he said he's really not interested in being in politics, so I think we should get Kasich's daughter up there to the podium real quick, fast, in a hurry, with a box of Krispy Kreme donuts for Chris Christie, and let's get this thing going.
[02:44:17.636 --> 02:44:20.919]  And I don't see how Paul Cruz could be in second place.
[02:44:20.939 --> 02:44:22.922]  He hasn't even really said that much tonight.
[02:44:23.993 --> 02:44:26.734]  Yeah, and we've got Ben Carson talking.
[02:44:26.774 --> 02:44:28.434]  There's all-hands Carson right there.
[02:44:28.594 --> 02:44:33.515]  Yeah, he's talking about how we need to make Europe dependent on us for energy.
[02:44:33.595 --> 02:44:41.817]  I don't really understand what he's saying, because it's difficult enough to understand what Ben Carson is saying, but when I'm just looking at the subtitles, I mean, this is all over the place.
[02:44:42.657 --> 02:44:45.658]  So, did any of you catch what he just said over there?
[02:44:45.738 --> 02:44:48.979]  All right, let's go back to the debate and pick up what they're saying here.
[02:44:49.019 --> 02:44:51.419]  ...cyber warfare like they have never seen before.
[02:44:51.900 --> 02:44:53.560]  What exactly would that response look like?
[02:44:53.860 --> 02:44:59.445]  Well, what it would look like is, we have one of the great advantages of America being the open society that we are.
[02:44:59.465 --> 02:45:02.127]  He's going to threaten some people again, because that's what he does, you know?
[02:45:02.207 --> 02:45:02.488]  He's a thug.
[02:45:02.688 --> 02:45:07.072]  But China every day is conducting business in a way that it hides things from their people.
[02:45:07.332 --> 02:45:20.564]  So, if they want to come in and attack all the personnel records in the federal government, which they've done, and which they now have my social security number and my fingerprints, as well as maybe some other folks who are on this stage, the fact is, they need to be fought back on.
[02:45:21.224 --> 02:45:23.885]  Maybe you guys need to know what you're doing.
[02:45:23.905 --> 02:45:24.765]  How about that?
[02:45:25.185 --> 02:45:26.566]  What's that say about your incompetence?
[02:45:26.586 --> 02:45:32.687]  You can't protect yourself.
[02:45:33.587 --> 02:45:41.050]  Let the American people start to understand how incompetent the American government is and how belligerent the American government is.
[02:45:41.230 --> 02:45:45.931]  When I look at Chris Christie, he's an odd mixture of incompetence and belligerence, isn't he?
[02:45:47.101 --> 02:45:51.766]  And how they emulate China's internet.
[02:45:51.826 --> 02:45:54.088]  They would like our internet style to be more like China.
[02:45:54.108 --> 02:45:55.910]  With a touch of Baron Harkonnen.
[02:45:55.970 --> 02:45:56.831]  Exactly, that's it.
[02:45:57.131 --> 02:45:59.113]  It is some open puss sores or something.
[02:45:59.293 --> 02:46:01.976]  They're coming, don't worry.
[02:46:02.076 --> 02:46:10.905]  Putin's incursions in the Middle East and in Eastern Europe and has led to significant problems in the Middle East as well and the death and murder of lots of folks.
[02:46:11.607 --> 02:46:17.911]  Governor Bush, what you just heard from Governor Christie, are you concerned that that could really escalate with China, that they would retaliate?
[02:46:18.351 --> 02:46:22.393]  And for example, as the NSA has said, attack the U.S.
[02:46:22.473 --> 02:46:25.075]  and maybe its power grid, which the Chinese have.
[02:46:25.115 --> 02:46:30.058]  We can shoot down the Russians and we can destroy the Chinese internet and they won't do anything.
[02:46:30.098 --> 02:46:32.219]  They're afraid of us because we're tough guys.
[02:46:32.359 --> 02:46:36.982]  Using a private server where classified information goes by.
[02:46:37.982 --> 02:46:40.123]  This is a serious administration.
[02:46:40.623 --> 02:46:46.964]  The President receives an Inspector General's report that the Office of Personnel Management could be hacked into.
[02:46:47.004 --> 02:46:48.345]  They antiquated firewalls.
[02:46:48.365 --> 02:46:51.366]  23 million files have been in the hands of the Chinese authorities.
[02:46:51.386 --> 02:46:58.327]  And of course we know they got all of Hillary Clinton's information because as Chris Christie just pointed out, they got all of the government's personnel records.
[02:46:58.347 --> 02:47:02.829]  So it's like even in their quote-unquote secure stations, they're not secure.
[02:47:02.869 --> 02:47:03.749]  This type of attack.
[02:47:04.329 --> 02:47:08.310]  How could Hillary Clinton's homegrown server be more secure than the federal government?
[02:47:08.330 --> 02:47:12.152]  The only thing her server is secure from is the American people.
[02:47:13.732 --> 02:47:16.093]  Everybody else knows what she's got on it.
[02:47:16.653 --> 02:47:22.655]  We need to create a situation where they know that there will be adverse impacts if they continue to do what they're doing.
[02:47:22.955 --> 02:47:23.796]  They'll respect that.
[02:47:24.216 --> 02:47:32.639]  They'll respect the United States that is serious about protecting... Quite frankly, we need to have a system where there's adverse consequences when our elected officials
[02:47:33.599 --> 02:47:37.981]  Violate the Constitution, violate the law, because then they'll know we're serious about it, won't they?
[02:47:38.001 --> 02:47:40.962]  You know, we always talk about getting tough with China and Russia.
[02:47:41.102 --> 02:47:42.522]  Why don't we get tough with Washington?
[02:47:42.622 --> 02:47:48.865]  Why don't we tell them there's going to be some consequences when you come out here and you urinate on the Constitution constantly?
[02:47:48.905 --> 02:47:54.807]  Or we have a criminal like Hillary Clinton being the frontrunner on the Democratic Party.
[02:47:54.827 --> 02:47:55.747]  That's insane.
[02:47:55.787 --> 02:47:57.728]  She needs to be in handcuffs and an orange suit.
[02:47:58.188 --> 02:47:59.709]  Here he is, Mr. Military.
[02:47:59.729 --> 02:48:03.011]  Hugh Hewitt's tactic is he always likes to quiz you on the little details, you know.
[02:48:17.498 --> 02:48:17.818]  He's a hack.
[02:48:35.959 --> 02:48:37.480]  Nuclear change is the whole ballgame.
[02:48:37.620 --> 02:48:39.941]  Frankly, I would have said, get out of Syria, get out.
[02:48:40.181 --> 02:48:50.585]  If we didn't have the power of weaponry today, the power is so massive that we can't just leave areas that 50 years ago or 75 years ago, we wouldn't care.
[02:48:50.605 --> 02:48:51.946]  It was hand-to-hand combat.
[02:48:52.366 --> 02:48:59.789]  The biggest problem this world has today is not President Obama with global warming, which is inconceivable, this is what he's saying,
[02:49:00.089 --> 02:49:00.329]  Yeah.
[02:49:15.504 --> 02:49:16.865]  Let me get you on some details here.
[02:49:16.905 --> 02:49:18.826]  Let me play the detail game again.
[02:49:18.846 --> 02:49:19.846]  Let's talk about these details.
[02:49:19.886 --> 02:49:22.568]  Hugh Hewitt and Marco Rubio, we understand this.
[02:49:38.396 --> 02:49:38.797]  I don't know.
[02:49:53.920 --> 02:49:56.021]  The air component also needs to be modernized.
[02:49:56.061 --> 02:50:02.826]  The B-52, as someone earlier pointed out, is an outdated model that was flown by the grandparents of people that are flying it now.
[02:50:03.166 --> 02:50:07.949]  And we need a serious modernization program as well on our silo-launched missiles.
[02:50:08.089 --> 02:50:09.970]  All three are critical for the defense of the country.
[02:50:10.010 --> 02:50:11.030]  Thank you, Senator Ruby.
[02:50:11.070 --> 02:50:12.031]  We need a new arms race.
[02:50:12.191 --> 02:50:17.074]  The bottom line, the military-industrial complex is just aching for new funding.
[02:50:17.174 --> 02:50:22.477]  And that's the thing, is that the biggest threat, really, is going to be a cyber attack or taking down our grid.
[02:50:22.517 --> 02:50:23.018]  They've already
[02:50:23.938 --> 02:50:31.201]  It showed that they can't protect their own files there, and they're building these huge ships with nuclear warheads.
[02:50:31.261 --> 02:50:33.421]  I mean, it doesn't even... We'll be taken out like that.
[02:50:33.441 --> 02:50:34.402]  I did.
[02:50:34.682 --> 02:50:43.145]  Let me just tell you, what I've gotten to know him over the last three or four days, he has a wonderful temperament.
[02:50:43.865 --> 02:50:44.785]  He's just fine.
[02:50:44.805 --> 02:50:46.446]  Don't worry about it.
[02:50:46.466 --> 02:50:46.726]  Okay.
[02:50:47.226 --> 02:50:49.627]  Shut her down.
[02:50:54.696 --> 02:50:55.196]  That's great.
[02:50:55.236 --> 02:50:58.337]  Don't worry about it.
[02:50:58.457 --> 02:50:59.978]  You better not attack him.
[02:50:59.998 --> 02:51:01.438]  See that's why he does so well.
[02:51:01.478 --> 02:51:01.878]  He's authentic.
[02:51:01.898 --> 02:51:02.418]  He's real life.
[02:51:10.541 --> 02:51:23.185]  Dana, what I said in private is exactly what I'll say here, which is that the judgment that every voter is making, of every one of us up here, is who has the experience, who has the vision, who has the judgment to be Commander-in-Chief.
[02:51:23.245 --> 02:51:25.726]  That is the most important decision for the voters to make.
[02:51:26.046 --> 02:51:38.111]  That's a standard I'm held to, and it's a standard everyone else is held to, and I will note, you know, in the whole course of this discussion about our foreign policy threats, it actually illustrates the need for clarity of focus.
[02:51:38.511 --> 02:51:38.691]  You know,
[02:51:39.486 --> 02:51:40.508]  What do they think?
[02:51:40.528 --> 02:51:41.729]  Let's talk about his daughters.
[02:51:50.635 --> 02:51:53.358]  Don't put him in schools!
[02:51:53.458 --> 02:51:55.620]  Don't put him in the government schools as they keep him safe.
[02:51:55.680 --> 02:51:57.882]  They've threatened him a number of ways.
[02:51:57.922 --> 02:52:01.305]  They're going to get their mandatory vaccines.
[02:52:01.325 --> 02:52:04.488]  But the real threat is a terror hoax.
[02:52:04.568 --> 02:52:12.555]  One of the things we've seen here is how easy it is for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to get distracted from dealing with radical Islamic terrorism.
[02:52:12.595 --> 02:52:14.237]  They won't even call it by its name.
[02:52:15.029 --> 02:52:24.431]  We need a president who stands up, number one, and says we will defeat ISIS, and number two, says the greatest national security threat facing America is a nuclear Iran.
[02:52:24.531 --> 02:52:29.412]  Let's not forget, in the last debate with the Democrats, they would not even say radical Islamic terrorists.
[02:52:29.432 --> 02:52:30.032]  Oh, they couldn't say it.
[02:52:30.072 --> 02:52:36.753]  And of course, now, after this terrorist attack, it'll be interesting to see if they, too, are given these type of questions.
[02:52:36.813 --> 02:52:37.274]  Oh, yeah.
[02:52:37.334 --> 02:52:39.154]  Because it's a whole different ballgame now.
[02:52:39.174 --> 02:52:40.014]  They still won't say radical Islam.
[02:52:40.034 --> 02:52:43.895]  They were saying there was no credible threat to the U.S., but the table has turned.
[02:52:44.295 --> 02:52:46.903]  I guarantee you Hillary and Bernie won't say radical Islam.
[02:52:46.923 --> 02:52:47.986]  That would not be helpful.
[02:52:48.568 --> 02:52:51.517]  Climate change is causing the mass migration.
[02:52:52.469 --> 02:52:56.392]  There's a real danger, Dana, when people get distracted.
[02:52:56.452 --> 02:52:57.613]  I'm answering the question, Wolf.
[02:52:58.033 --> 02:53:01.937]  There's a real danger when people get distracted by peripheral issues.
[02:53:01.957 --> 02:53:03.878]  They get distracted by democracy building.
[02:53:04.198 --> 02:53:07.301]  They get distracted about military conflicts.
[02:53:07.501 --> 02:53:10.263]  We need to focus on defeating jihadism.
[02:53:10.864 --> 02:53:18.310]  ISIS and Iran have declared war on America, and we need a commander-in-chief who will do everything necessary to keep our children safe.
[02:53:18.330 --> 02:53:18.750]  Thank you, Senator.
[02:53:18.810 --> 02:53:21.032]  And I will do everything necessary to keep our children safe.
[02:53:21.072 --> 02:53:21.873]  Thank you, Senator.
[02:53:21.893 --> 02:53:25.316]  We're a month and a half away now from the first real test.
[02:53:25.576 --> 02:53:28.458]  Who will be the Republican presidential nominee?
[02:53:28.578 --> 02:53:29.539]  Hugh, you have a question.
[02:53:29.699 --> 02:53:36.144]  Mr. Trump, my listeners tell me again and again they're worried that Hillary Clinton will win the White House because you run as an independent.
[02:53:36.445 --> 02:53:42.610]  Are you ready to reassure Republicans tonight that you will run as a Republican and abide by the decision of the Republicans?
[02:53:42.690 --> 02:53:43.751]  I'll be honest.
[02:53:43.851 --> 02:53:44.411]  I really am.
[02:53:44.471 --> 02:53:47.193]  I mean, people have been putting me to the test.
[02:53:47.313 --> 02:53:48.154]  I really am.
[02:53:52.198 --> 02:53:59.867]  I've gained great respect for the Republican leadership.
[02:54:00.087 --> 02:54:05.733]  I've gained great respect for many, and I'm going to even say all, I mean in different forms, for the people on the dais.
[02:54:07.435 --> 02:54:12.038]  In different forms, but I have great respect for the people I've met through this process.
[02:54:12.058 --> 02:54:13.479]  I've never done this process before.
[02:54:13.499 --> 02:54:14.660]  I've never been a politician.
[02:54:14.700 --> 02:54:16.821]  I mean, for the last six months, I've been a politician.
[02:54:17.302 --> 02:54:21.324]  But I will tell you, I am totally committed to the Republican Party.
[02:54:21.384 --> 02:54:23.846]  I feel very honored to be the front runner.
[02:54:24.547 --> 02:54:27.569]  And I think I'll do very well if I'm chosen.
[02:54:27.609 --> 02:54:30.791]  If I'm so, so fortunate to be chosen, I think I'll do very well.
[02:54:30.851 --> 02:54:33.032]  Polls have come out recently say I would beat Hillary.
[02:54:33.192 --> 02:54:36.334]  I will do everything in my power to beat Hillary Clinton.
[02:54:38.216 --> 02:54:39.677]  You just got in, Ben!
[02:54:53.271 --> 02:54:54.592]  Hardly been there a year.
[02:54:54.612 --> 02:54:57.013]  I think Ben is new to politics.
[02:55:22.304 --> 02:55:25.687]  You shouldn't have made such a big stink about it.
[02:55:26.728 --> 02:55:36.197]  Everyone will have an opportunity to explain why this particular candidate, each of you on the stage, believes he or she should be the Republican presidential nominee.
[02:55:36.898 --> 02:55:37.258]  Okay.
[02:55:37.518 --> 02:55:39.981]  And then after that, I guess we'll ask them what their favorite color is.
[02:55:40.261 --> 02:55:40.481]  Right.
[02:55:40.982 --> 02:55:41.903]  Their superhero name.
[02:55:41.943 --> 02:55:43.804]  Why should you be the nominee?
[02:55:44.065 --> 02:55:45.266]  Any comments before we get a break?
[02:55:47.011 --> 02:55:54.419]  Well, I mean, I do agree with Biggs that Trump seems to, he seems to do his tongue lashing out when he's speaking with the media.
[02:55:54.599 --> 02:55:57.862]  But there on the debate stage, he just kind of plays it loose.
[02:55:58.242 --> 02:55:59.844]  I thought he did very well in that last exchange.
[02:55:59.864 --> 02:56:00.164]  I agree.
[02:56:00.244 --> 02:56:03.448]  I think when he just came back and said, nah, he's a great guy, just laughed it off.
[02:56:03.948 --> 02:56:05.689]  I think that was the best he could have played it.
[02:56:05.709 --> 02:56:06.589]  What do you think?
[02:56:06.629 --> 02:56:14.052]  Yeah, I liked him more towards the end than he did at the beginning when he was talking about, you know, the surveillance state and all these other things that I'm definitely not a fan of.
[02:56:14.432 --> 02:56:16.173]  But he also did make some very good points.
[02:56:16.213 --> 02:56:20.335]  And like you said, he handled himself pretty well, even though they continue to attack the guy.
[02:56:20.655 --> 02:56:23.856]  It's pretty much they should just call it like the CNN attack Trump debate.
[02:56:23.896 --> 02:56:24.757]  That's how they're doing.
[02:56:24.797 --> 02:56:27.758]  Almost every question is directed at him in some form or another.
[02:56:28.266 --> 02:56:31.347]  I'd like to see a Trump-Paul ticket.
[02:56:31.647 --> 02:56:31.847]  Yeah.
[02:56:32.467 --> 02:56:37.448]  Well, I would like to see them debate and really try to nail him on some clarity on these things.
[02:56:37.508 --> 02:56:44.110]  I mean, is it just that he's not speaking clearly, or does he really want to shut down our freedoms?
[02:56:46.071 --> 02:56:47.391]  I'm really not comfortable with that.
[02:56:47.411 --> 02:56:51.232]  But let's go to break, and we'll be right back with the debate as it continues.
[02:56:52.152 --> 02:56:57.076]  Shane Steiner's involvement with InfoWarsLife.com truly happened in an organic way.
[02:56:57.217 --> 02:56:59.939]  I went to high school with Shane, his brother, knew his parents well.
[02:57:00.139 --> 02:57:05.824]  And he was visiting the office once, hadn't been to the office in years, and said, wow, I notice you're making and selling supplements.
[02:57:05.844 --> 02:57:06.605]  Do these really work?
[02:57:06.645 --> 02:57:11.689]  Because I've tried a lot of supplements as a workout enthusiast, and I really think most of them are hype.
[02:57:11.809 --> 02:57:13.210]  And I said, here, take some home, try it.
[02:57:13.310 --> 02:57:19.894]  Well, a few weeks later, he came in blown away and said, I want to buy three boxes of this stuff to give my friends and family.
[02:57:20.294 --> 02:57:21.795]  It's simply amazing.
[02:57:21.835 --> 02:57:23.116]  He said, why does it work so well?
[02:57:23.156 --> 02:57:27.699]  And I said, listen, go to Infowarslife.com, watch the informational videos with Dr. Group and others.
[02:57:27.899 --> 02:57:29.400]  They understand how it all works.
[02:57:29.680 --> 02:57:31.261]  I know that it works for me.
[02:57:31.381 --> 02:57:32.522]  That's all I understand.
[02:57:32.782 --> 02:57:37.825]  The science, the facts, the research, people's testimonials, they're all on Infowarslife.com.
[02:57:37.845 --> 02:57:38.826]  You can check it out for yourself.
[02:57:39.426 --> 02:57:40.526]  I wanted to go to the gym.
[02:57:40.766 --> 02:57:50.609]  I wanted to push myself and work out harder and that led to me being able to come out and do stuff like the barefooting and the surfing and stuff like that, which I would have never done.
[02:57:50.629 --> 02:57:53.170]  I never would have done that two years ago.
[02:57:53.750 --> 02:57:57.391]  Shane has said over and over again, more than just libido and energy,
[02:57:57.931 --> 02:57:59.713]  It made him want to get into the gym more.
[02:58:00.033 --> 02:58:01.515]  It made him want to get in better shape.
[02:58:01.535 --> 02:58:04.157]  And believe me, the Steiners have amazing genetics.
[02:58:04.718 --> 02:58:07.160]  His brother is a world champion steer wrestler.
[02:58:07.481 --> 02:58:11.485]  His dad, Bobby Steiner, is a famous world champion bull rider.
[02:58:11.665 --> 02:58:13.347]  They've got natural genetics.
[02:58:13.787 --> 02:58:18.512]  But when you added this to the mix, in Shane's own words, it took him to the next level.
[02:58:30.791 --> 02:58:32.512]  Shane noticed the mental clarity.
[02:58:32.952 --> 02:58:36.434]  Bobby was able to work out longer and gain muscle mass.
[02:58:36.574 --> 02:58:37.854]  He's already completely shredded.
[02:58:38.075 --> 02:58:40.716]  I gotta admit, for me, the biggest effect has been libido.
[02:58:41.076 --> 02:58:47.139]  Now, I've never claimed to have a body like some beach model, but back when I was 20, 22 years old and worked out every day, I looked great.
[02:58:47.179 --> 02:58:53.182]  But over the years, being married, having three kids, working 18 hours a day, I gained basically 100 pounds.
[02:58:53.342 --> 02:58:56.464]  And it's been a long process of losing that weight in the last four years.
[02:58:56.624 --> 02:58:59.225]  But if you look at the photos and the videos,
[02:58:59.465 --> 02:59:02.346]  of what I looked like four or five years ago versus today.
[02:59:02.586 --> 02:59:04.147]  The results are dramatic.
[02:59:04.387 --> 02:59:05.728]  I'd already cleaned up my diet.
[02:59:05.848 --> 02:59:08.849]  I was working out hard, but I'd only lost about 20 pounds.
[02:59:09.049 --> 02:59:18.174]  It was adding the other key ingredients from InfoWarsLife.com that helped me personally go to the next level and shed another 35 pounds.
[02:59:18.654 --> 02:59:27.098]  This has actually made me feel so good that here lately, about a year ago, I started training jujitsu and that kind of led to doing
[02:59:34.349 --> 02:59:39.475]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News live coverage of the December 15, 2015 GOP debate.
[02:59:39.895 --> 02:59:42.398]  David Knight, Leanne McAdoo, Jakari Jackson.
[02:59:43.079 --> 02:59:45.862]  Are we going to go to Richard Reeves in Nevada?
[02:59:47.244 --> 02:59:47.424]  Yeah.
[02:59:47.864 --> 02:59:50.227]  Let's pull up with the debate.
[02:59:50.267 --> 02:59:51.889]  We've got them making some closing statements.
[02:59:54.548 --> 02:59:57.330]  The people of Ohio are the people of America.
[02:59:57.751 --> 03:00:00.293]  The people of America are reflected in Ohio.
[03:00:00.993 --> 03:00:06.918]  Our message has to be big, and bold, and positive, and connect, not just with people's heads.
[03:00:07.338 --> 03:00:08.559]  All right, let's go to Richard Reeves.
[03:00:08.599 --> 03:00:10.460]  We missed Rand Paul's statement there.
[03:00:10.480 --> 03:00:11.181]  We're on commercial break.
[03:00:11.221 --> 03:00:13.683]  Let's go to Richard Reeves in Las Vegas.
[03:00:13.963 --> 03:00:14.243]  Richard.
[03:00:15.784 --> 03:00:16.405]  Thank you, David.
[03:00:16.785 --> 03:00:22.770]  Well, it's been one heck of a debate, and I guess we've still got a little bit more left, but I think that
[03:00:23.365 --> 03:00:25.766]  The delegates need to be lining up.
[03:00:26.587 --> 03:00:52.059]  We need to make sure that the GOP establishment, although, you know, I think maybe Trump and Carson had a little bit of peacemaking session with the GOP, and maybe sooner or later they'll realize that this is just part of the way to getting our country back, because... Yeah, we were just told, we were just told, Richard, I guess you heard the debate, and they asked Carson that, and he said, well, I've been reassured by Rince Priebus that they're going to play fair this time.
[03:00:52.100 --> 03:00:52.520]  You believe that?
[03:00:53.968 --> 03:01:01.170]  Well, I'd say Ritz Priebus himself is a puppet of bigger masters above him.
[03:01:02.014 --> 03:01:04.476]  So, uh, yeah, that's what he'll say, you know.
[03:01:04.996 --> 03:01:06.177]  You know, that's classic.
[03:01:06.217 --> 03:01:07.479]  They say one thing and do another.
[03:01:07.499 --> 03:01:13.804]  Yeah, I think if Ben Carson believes that, I think if Ben Carson believes that, we know that he truly is a neophyte, right?
[03:01:14.144 --> 03:01:14.744]  Pretty gullible.
[03:01:14.784 --> 03:01:20.229]  Well, I don't even think Carson really necessarily believes it, but, uh, you know, it's probably kind of what he's going to say.
[03:01:20.289 --> 03:01:22.411]  Kind of a little bit of go along, get along in this case.
[03:01:22.711 --> 03:01:22.891]  Yeah.
[03:01:23.091 --> 03:01:24.833]  But, um, you know, time will tell.
[03:01:25.013 --> 03:01:29.677]  And one thing I do think about Trump is I know there's issues about him in the domain
[03:01:30.238 --> 03:01:33.589]  We're a little bit worried about free speech, internet, that type of thing.
[03:01:35.598 --> 03:01:38.721]  You know, I think he knows what's going on behind the scenes.
[03:01:38.821 --> 03:01:44.806]  I think he's smart, so I wouldn't be too surprised if he does what he has to do, unfortunately, to win.
[03:01:45.626 --> 03:01:50.731]  Which, right now, I think Jesus, if Jesus himself came back on this planet, that probably Jesus could not win.
[03:01:50.851 --> 03:01:55.174]  So, we'll just have to see what happens, and time will tell.
[03:01:55.855 --> 03:02:01.600]  And in the meantime, as more days and weeks and months go by, we're going to know more and more about all of these candidates.
[03:02:02.140 --> 03:02:16.590]  Well it was interesting, the back and forth, I don't know if you caught it there in Vegas, the back and forth between Donald Trump about what happened with the Osama Bin Laden family right after, the day after 9-11, and the back and forth they had with Jeb Bush.
[03:02:16.770 --> 03:02:18.231]  I thought that was a great back and forth.
[03:02:18.431 --> 03:02:22.173]  We'll have a lot to talk about tomorrow to replay that clip for sure.
[03:02:23.094 --> 03:02:28.077]  Oh yeah, well I did catch that, I heard the comeback that Donald Trump started immediately talking about
[03:02:28.759 --> 03:02:38.141]  That the Bush family made sure that the Bin Laden family was flown out within the next day or so after 9-11, despite the fact that all other domestic travel was grounded.
[03:02:38.641 --> 03:02:39.201]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:02:39.401 --> 03:02:45.282]  And of course, Jeb's response was, well, that's why, you know, Trump is not a serious candidate.
[03:02:45.962 --> 03:02:50.603]  Because he exposes stuff like that, that makes him not a serious candidate.
[03:02:50.643 --> 03:02:52.523]  I mean, you just don't talk about that kind of stuff, right?
[03:02:52.543 --> 03:02:54.844]  It wasn't even an ad hominem attack or hitting below the belt.
[03:02:54.964 --> 03:02:56.464]  It was, those are facts.
[03:02:56.664 --> 03:02:59.686]  Well, it was in the context of what you're going to do about the families of people who are terrorists.
[03:02:59.706 --> 03:03:01.246]  And he goes, well, let's look at what the Bushes did.
[03:03:01.447 --> 03:03:03.688]  We were told this guy's a terrorist.
[03:03:03.708 --> 03:03:06.649]  They sent his family back with an escorted flight the next day.
[03:03:07.270 --> 03:03:07.890]  Private jets.
[03:03:08.250 --> 03:03:10.111]  Yeah, that's exactly valid.
[03:03:10.131 --> 03:03:14.774]  But of course, Jeb says, well, that means that you're not part of the club.
[03:03:14.834 --> 03:03:16.875]  You can't criticize my brother.
[03:03:16.895 --> 03:03:18.616]  That means you're not part of the country.
[03:03:18.636 --> 03:03:21.958]  He used that whole bin Laden story for the war on terror.
[03:03:22.677 --> 03:03:29.581]  If you're in that club that we've been hearing George Carlin talk about, you know, people who are in that club do not criticize other people in that club.
[03:03:30.382 --> 03:03:30.902]  End of story.
[03:03:31.363 --> 03:03:32.683]  You protect the brotherhood.
[03:03:32.703 --> 03:03:35.165]  Anything else you want to tell us, Richard, from Las Vegas?
[03:03:35.946 --> 03:03:40.448]  Well, you know, Jeff's saying that that's what makes you not a serious candidate, Donald Trump.
[03:03:40.528 --> 03:03:41.489]  I think maybe it is.
[03:03:41.649 --> 03:03:42.730]  Maybe he's just...
[03:03:43.804 --> 03:03:48.149]  Ultra too serious for Jeb Bush in that regard as far as 9-11 goes.
[03:03:48.429 --> 03:03:50.932]  Oh yeah, that's what actually does make him a serious candidate.
[03:03:51.152 --> 03:03:52.553]  It's what makes him a serious threat.
[03:03:52.874 --> 03:04:02.343]  The fact that he will go off of their carefully contained script and agenda and that's why he's resonating with the American public in spite of these other issues that I'm very, very concerned about.
[03:04:02.383 --> 03:04:03.465]  Still very concerned about those.
[03:04:03.925 --> 03:04:12.111]  But yeah, it is good to have that back and forth, and that's one of the values of this whole process, is that we get this kind of discussion.
[03:04:12.171 --> 03:04:16.014]  Occasionally, they get outside this very tightly controlled agenda.
[03:04:16.034 --> 03:04:21.678]  We could see that not only with CNN, but with Hugh Hewitt and the other questioner there.
[03:04:21.959 --> 03:04:23.380]  They kept it very, very
[03:04:23.860 --> 03:04:24.781]  Yes, go ahead Richard.
[03:04:47.369 --> 03:04:48.551]  That's absolutely right.
[03:04:49.072 --> 03:04:53.318]  We do see more and more truth coming through the cracks in the veneer.
[03:04:53.919 --> 03:04:55.941]  That to me is very exciting.
[03:04:56.502 --> 03:04:59.086]  I know Alex has worked for 20 some odd years on this.
[03:04:59.647 --> 03:05:02.311]  I've worked that long and maybe a little bit more.
[03:05:02.911 --> 03:05:07.614]  And trying to overcome the media, trying to get the truth out about all these issues.
[03:05:08.094 --> 03:05:09.815]  And finally, cracks are in the veneer.
[03:05:10.215 --> 03:05:16.959]  What we're going to do, I guess, is see, just like the little Dutch boy with his thumb in the dike, we're seeing little sprays of water coming through.
[03:05:17.379 --> 03:05:23.142]  But hopefully, this election cycle, we'll see the dam burst and all kinds of truth come out.
[03:05:23.682 --> 03:05:24.143]  Absolutely.
[03:05:24.723 --> 03:05:31.388]  Well, thank you very much, Richard, and we'll be coming back to you as you travel to Iowa as well as to New Hampshire.
[03:05:31.408 --> 03:05:33.269]  That's going to be some very interesting reporting.
[03:05:33.289 --> 03:05:36.392]  I think you're going to be able to get very close to these candidates in those venues.
[03:05:37.513 --> 03:05:38.653]  Thank y'all over there in Austin.
[03:05:38.693 --> 03:05:38.954]  Thank you.
[03:05:38.974 --> 03:05:39.634]  All right, thanks.
[03:05:40.034 --> 03:05:40.555]  Let's go back.
[03:05:40.595 --> 03:05:42.316]  This is Donald Trump's closing statements.
[03:05:42.456 --> 03:05:48.120]  We will win a lot, and we're going to have a great, great country, greater than ever before.
[03:05:49.281 --> 03:05:49.582]  Thank you.
[03:05:50.600 --> 03:05:52.281]  Thanks to all the Republican presidential candidates.
[03:05:52.301 --> 03:05:53.662]  That does it for this presidential debate.
[03:05:53.702 --> 03:05:54.882]  On behalf of everyone at CNN.
[03:05:54.962 --> 03:05:56.703]  Another debate bites the dust.
[03:06:12.369 --> 03:06:12.629]  Nothing.
[03:06:12.910 --> 03:06:13.590]  All right, all right.
[03:06:31.028 --> 03:06:34.591]  Because the American people probably don't even understand all of that.
[03:06:34.671 --> 03:06:44.000]  They truly think that it's just their votes when they go to the ballot, but they don't even understand that second tier process, and they make it like a labyrinth on purpose.
[03:06:44.642 --> 03:06:49.686]  It's a very, very, very complicated system that they have created, deliberately so, because it allows them to control it.
[03:06:49.706 --> 03:06:53.089]  You know, it's the same sort of thing they have with the income tax code.
[03:06:53.229 --> 03:06:59.433]  Many people have said a system of rules that is sufficiently complex is the same as having no rules at all.
[03:06:59.934 --> 03:07:03.476]  And so that's what we have with the Republican situation.
[03:07:03.917 --> 03:07:07.640]  There was an article in the Washington Post, this is what happens if Republicans face a brokered convention.
[03:07:08.200 --> 03:07:09.902]  And I started reading all the details of this.
[03:07:10.002 --> 03:07:12.505]  There's so many different caveats in this.
[03:07:12.585 --> 03:07:15.849]  It's such a complicated situation, the way they allocate the delegates.
[03:07:16.150 --> 03:07:23.659]  There's a lot of delegates that the Republican National Committee itself gets to allocate, regardless of who wins in these different areas, okay?
[03:07:24.079 --> 03:07:32.744]  So, there's proportional allocation, you have some places where it's primaries, it's winner-take-all, some places caucuses where it's winner-take-all, or it's allocated proportionally.
[03:07:33.105 --> 03:07:38.928]  And then you've got the massive footprint of the Republican Party itself.
[03:07:39.088 --> 03:07:41.370]  They reserve themselves a lot of delegates.
[03:07:41.710 --> 03:07:46.773]  So, from the very first ballot, they have a chance to do a lot of mischief.
[03:07:47.093 --> 03:07:52.016]  And then, of course, if you don't have a clear winner, then it does get into gradually, and all the rules are different.
[03:07:52.096 --> 03:07:52.436]  We're good to go.
[03:08:17.139 --> 03:08:23.484]  I think the fact that Donald Trump is pointing out some of these things and making these statements, I think that's very important.
[03:08:23.664 --> 03:08:24.844]  It's going to be very valuable.
[03:08:25.445 --> 03:08:32.510]  The American people and we in the press, at least at InfoWars, we are going to be watching this very closely.
[03:08:32.630 --> 03:08:34.791]  We're going to be reporting on it in great detail.
[03:08:35.132 --> 03:08:38.474]  If they try to game this system, we are going to be on top of this.
[03:08:38.514 --> 03:08:39.615]  We're not going to let that happen.
[03:08:39.915 --> 03:08:54.507]  We need to shine the light of truth on this whole process, expose it for what it is, and they need to know that if they try any of this stuff, and I don't care which candidates we're talking about, we need to get to the point where we understand how this system has been corrupted so that we can take it back and make it honest.
[03:08:54.587 --> 03:08:57.189]  Right, and that you're only going to hear about that process.
[03:08:57.369 --> 03:08:57.589]  Yeah.
[03:09:16.472 --> 03:09:19.933]  And I just want to jump in here guys and say none of these guys are going to keep us safe.
[03:09:19.953 --> 03:09:20.193]  That's right.
[03:09:39.218 --> 03:09:40.499]  That's not their responsibility.
[03:09:40.539 --> 03:09:41.540]  That's not their job.
[03:09:41.700 --> 03:09:45.163]  And there's nowhere in their presidential address that says, we're going to keep you safe.
[03:09:45.183 --> 03:09:45.823]  Right.
[03:09:46.144 --> 03:09:47.224]  It doesn't exist.
[03:09:47.344 --> 03:09:48.425]  It's a total lie.
[03:09:48.926 --> 03:09:49.967]  It just doesn't happen.
[03:09:50.467 --> 03:09:51.428]  Well, just look at the police.
[03:09:51.788 --> 03:09:53.269]  They've been sued numerous times.
[03:09:53.329 --> 03:09:56.932]  Of course, I've said numerous times, the police have no responsibility to keep you safe.
[03:09:57.212 --> 03:09:59.294]  They are there to enforce their own policy.
[03:09:59.554 --> 03:10:00.675]  And that's what these people are doing.
[03:10:00.715 --> 03:10:01.836]  They are not going to keep you safe.
[03:10:01.856 --> 03:10:02.717]  You give up your freedom.
[03:10:03.217 --> 03:10:04.157]  You're not going to be safe, folks.
[03:10:04.177 --> 03:10:08.758]  I mean, I expect to go home tonight and see Jeb Bush at my door.
[03:10:09.238 --> 03:10:09.878]  In New York.
[03:10:09.898 --> 03:10:10.419]  Keeping me safe.
[03:10:10.459 --> 03:10:17.840]  Where a guy was in a subway train and a door separated him between an officer, he's being stabbed with a knife, and the officer didn't respond and help the guy.
[03:10:18.120 --> 03:10:21.321]  And then when they asked the officer later, he was like, it's not my job to keep you safe.
[03:10:21.661 --> 03:10:26.382]  But like, dude said, maybe Jeb Bush would be there at his house with a shotgun, making sure nobody comes and breaks in.
[03:10:26.402 --> 03:10:27.042]  Right.
[03:10:27.745 --> 03:10:35.747]  Well, I wish we would see some candidates out there who would say, look, I understand that the first job of government is to respect your rights.
[03:10:35.827 --> 03:10:37.167]  That's why we created the government.
[03:10:37.187 --> 03:10:38.807]  That's what the Declaration of Independence says.
[03:10:39.207 --> 03:10:42.708]  The founders of this country fought the most powerful nation on earth.
[03:10:42.748 --> 03:10:44.029]  They weren't concerned about safety.
[03:10:44.249 --> 03:10:45.909]  They were concerned about their liberty.
[03:10:46.569 --> 03:10:49.090]  Let's go to Joe Biggs and the Twitter station.
[03:10:49.130 --> 03:10:50.670]  Joe, your comments on tonight's debate.
[03:10:51.323 --> 03:10:56.004]  Well, it's amazing that Rand Paul opens up talking about the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, how we need to protect that.
[03:10:56.024 --> 03:10:59.325]  We need to remember that that's what we as Americans are based off of.
[03:10:59.665 --> 03:11:13.309]  I think it's a little cause for concern that we have Chris Christie still allowed, or sorry, Chris Krispy Kreme allowed to be in these debates when he is pushing for essentially World War III by saying that he would shoot down a Russian plane.
[03:11:13.649 --> 03:11:17.870]  And then you have Marco Rubio who is really just a frontrunner above Lindsey Graham.
[03:11:18.190 --> 03:11:19.691]  I think both of those guys and
[03:11:20.331 --> 03:11:20.971]  I don't know.
[03:11:39.199 --> 03:11:43.922]  You know, my belief as far as tonight, that Rand Paul clearly won this debate.
[03:11:44.282 --> 03:11:45.323]  He came out swinging.
[03:11:45.543 --> 03:11:46.664]  He stuck with his guns.
[03:11:46.944 --> 03:11:49.625]  That's the person that I believe he could have always been.
[03:11:49.966 --> 03:11:53.988]  And I wish he would have done that this entire time throughout these last few debates.
[03:11:54.028 --> 03:11:58.451]  Hopefully it's not too late for him to actually get in there and get that nomination.
[03:11:58.931 --> 03:12:03.072]  Well, you know, Trump's thing has never really been to stand out in the debates.
[03:12:03.413 --> 03:12:06.614]  His position has always been to play it kind of safe and defensive in the debates.
[03:12:06.654 --> 03:12:11.075]  Where he comes on the offense is, you know, with the media the rest of the time.
[03:12:11.115 --> 03:12:12.676]  Because he knows that's what's going to get legs.
[03:12:12.856 --> 03:12:13.336]  Exactly.
[03:12:13.396 --> 03:12:21.239]  He knows how to get the attention outside the debates, so he just needs to break even in these debates.
[03:12:21.279 --> 03:12:25.080]  He knows that everybody's going to be coming after him, so he kind of just kind of lays back.
[03:12:25.560 --> 03:12:29.781]  They need to dump Carson, they need to dump Kasich, and they need to dump Christie.
[03:12:29.821 --> 03:12:31.901]  We need to get it down to the rest of the guys in Fiorina.
[03:12:32.241 --> 03:12:38.703]  And they need to get it down to those last... We need to have Trump, we need to have Rand Paul, and we need to have Cruz, really.
[03:12:38.983 --> 03:12:41.183]  Those three should be in the next debates from here on out.
[03:12:41.403 --> 03:12:47.525]  Let's see what these three have to say, and let's really push these guys on the issues at hand and stop the bickering back and forth.
[03:12:47.545 --> 03:12:49.385]  I really would like to see them... I think they're really watering down the party.
[03:12:49.645 --> 03:12:49.985]  Exactly.
[03:12:50.005 --> 03:12:53.327]  I'd like to see them really push them for clarification on these issues.
[03:12:53.368 --> 03:12:57.110]  Like, what do you exactly think you're going to do with the internet?
[03:12:57.230 --> 03:13:00.892]  You're open to taking people's guns if the government puts them on a secret list?
[03:13:00.933 --> 03:13:09.038]  Explain to me where the government has the authority to put people on a secret list to start with, and then to attach penalties to that.
[03:13:09.378 --> 03:13:12.601]  So, there needs to be some discussion of some real substantive issues.
[03:13:13.002 --> 03:13:15.124]  You're not going to hear it, though, from the media.
[03:13:15.144 --> 03:13:18.127]  They're going to continue this very narrow selection of issues.
[03:13:18.607 --> 03:13:26.254]  They're either going to talk about tax rates and brackets, or they're going to talk about how many troops you're going to send to the next war, and which wars you're going to go.
[03:13:26.275 --> 03:13:28.036]  I mean, that's what we hear in every one of these debates.
[03:13:28.897 --> 03:13:29.317]  Absolutely.
[03:13:29.598 --> 03:13:29.838]  Yeah.
[03:13:30.138 --> 03:13:31.960]  So, I think that's it for our coverage tonight.
[03:13:31.980 --> 03:13:33.602]  Right now, they're just wrapping things up.
[03:13:34.482 --> 03:13:39.785]  Going through the crowd at CNN, there's a shot of Ted Cruz.
[03:13:40.466 --> 03:13:41.326]  But thanks for joining us.
[03:13:41.386 --> 03:13:48.070]  This has been the InfoWars Nightly News crew and our live coverage of the December 15, 2015 debate, the final debate of 2015.
[03:13:48.210 --> 03:13:51.312]  Of course, there's going to be many more that will be coming up.
[03:13:51.512 --> 03:13:55.394]  And as you saw, we had our reporter Richard Reeves in Las Vegas tonight.
[03:13:55.994 --> 03:13:58.995]  And he is going to be going to Iowa and New Hampshire.
[03:13:59.075 --> 03:14:04.257]  There's going to be a great opportunity for him to get up and directly ask questions to some of these candidates.
[03:14:04.277 --> 03:14:08.639]  So hopefully we'll be able to get some real substantive questions put forward in that venue.
[03:14:09.019 --> 03:14:18.483]  Because after Iowa and New Hampshire, it's then going to become a distant media campaign that's going to be waged back and forth with ads in the media.
[03:14:18.863 --> 03:14:21.605]  So right now, in the next couple of months, you're going to see this coming up.
[03:14:21.985 --> 03:14:23.986]  InfoWars will be sending our report around.
[03:14:24.026 --> 03:14:32.352]  I think we're going to be able to get some access to these candidates because nobody else wants to talk to them, frankly, when they're going door-to-door, restaurant-to-restaurant.
[03:14:32.692 --> 03:14:33.672]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:14:33.732 --> 03:14:35.273]  That's the end of our coverage tonight.
[03:14:35.293 --> 03:14:37.835]  Join us again tomorrow at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:14:37.895 --> 03:14:38.996]  Eastern, for the Nightly News.
[03:14:43.419 --> 03:14:44.539]  It's never going to get any better.
[03:14:44.559 --> 03:14:45.680]  Don't look for it.
[03:14:46.100 --> 03:14:47.161]  Be happy with what you got.
[03:14:48.354 --> 03:14:51.398]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[03:14:51.959 --> 03:14:53.621]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[03:14:54.021 --> 03:14:59.668]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[03:15:00.049 --> 03:15:01.290]  Forget the politicians.
[03:15:01.510 --> 03:15:04.774]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[03:15:06.356 --> 03:15:06.757]  You don't.
[03:15:07.552 --> 03:15:08.552]  You have no choice.
[03:15:08.912 --> 03:15:09.853]  You have owners.
[03:15:10.153 --> 03:15:11.193]  They own you.
[03:15:12.433 --> 03:15:13.713]  They own everything.
[03:15:13.953 --> 03:15:15.594]  They own all the important land.
[03:15:15.954 --> 03:15:17.694]  They own and control the corporations.
[03:15:17.734 --> 03:15:21.195]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.
[03:15:21.215 --> 03:15:22.815]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[03:15:23.135 --> 03:15:27.957]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[03:15:28.117 --> 03:15:29.757]  They got you by the balls!
[03:15:31.255 --> 03:15:33.377]  They want obedient workers.
[03:15:33.797 --> 03:15:35.298]  Obedient workers.
[03:15:35.618 --> 03:15:48.328]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[03:15:48.388 --> 03:15:51.631]  And now, they're coming for your social security money.
[03:15:52.111 --> 03:15:54.753]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[03:15:56.174 --> 03:15:57.075]  It's a big club.
[03:15:58.061 --> 03:15:58.881]  And you ain't in it.
[03:15:59.481 --> 03:16:02.182]  You and I are not in the big club.
[03:16:02.542 --> 03:16:04.502]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[03:16:05.143 --> 03:16:08.863]  It's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[03:16:10.284 --> 03:16:11.784]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[03:16:12.144 --> 03:16:15.625]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[03:16:15.645 --> 03:16:19.566]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[03:16:19.586 --> 03:16:20.546]  They're not interested in that.
[03:16:20.826 --> 03:16:21.746]  That doesn't help them.
[03:16:22.146 --> 03:16:23.527]  That's against their interest.
[03:16:24.067 --> 03:16:24.407]  It's great.
[03:16:34.415 --> 03:16:38.337]  You are watching the InfoWars Nightly News, which airs 7 p.m.

[03:16:55.015 --> 03:16:56.216]  Knockout is back.
[03:16:56.557 --> 03:17:07.667]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[03:17:08.048 --> 03:17:09.769]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:17:10.270 --> 03:17:19.359]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin and more.
[03:17:19.779 --> 03:17:21.521]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[03:17:22.102 --> 03:17:26.506]  It's the same price as leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece.
[03:17:26.967 --> 03:17:29.630]  It has three milligrams, the standard recommended dose for an adult.
[03:17:30.150 --> 03:17:31.992]  It's got the GABA.
[03:17:32.673 --> 03:17:36.397]  So it would probably cost $50 to take all this as separate pills.
[03:17:36.898 --> 03:17:37.498]  It's $19.95.
[03:17:38.820 --> 03:17:40.081]  You take one or two of these.
[03:17:41.142 --> 03:17:44.443]  And it just is really clean, restful sleep is what the reviews are.
[03:17:44.783 --> 03:17:45.863]  It's what I've experienced.
[03:17:46.303 --> 03:17:48.684]  And it just synergistically puts everything in there.
