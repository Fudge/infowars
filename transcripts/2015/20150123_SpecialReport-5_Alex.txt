[00:00:00.471 --> 00:00:01.594]  Here he comes!
[00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:15.818]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com, and I'm here to talk about the scandal, the flake gate that's going on right now.
[00:00:15.858 --> 00:00:24.501]  If you turn on your TV or get on the Internet and look at any kind of news source, you're more than likely going to see some kind of headline talking about this scandal that is going on.
[00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:30.724]  Now, a reporter out of Indianapolis the morning after the AFC Championship when the New England Patriots mollywhopped
[00:00:31.124 --> 00:00:51.010]  The Indianapolis Colts with a running game, which has nothing to do with the ball being squishy, came out in a report saying that the New England Patriots deliberately deflated the balls so it was easier for Tom Brady to throw and grip and for the receivers to also carry and catch in the cold, wet, rainy weather up in Foxboro.
[00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.814]  Well, this is some crap to me.
[00:00:54.934 --> 00:00:56.195]  I think it's a load of BS.
[00:00:56.596 --> 00:01:01.702]  What's happening is, is they want to make a scandal to go behind the game so people hate the Patriots.
[00:01:01.922 --> 00:01:03.784]  There's going to be a huge ratings push.
[00:01:03.844 --> 00:01:07.649]  Tons of people are going to watch the Super Bowl purely out of hate.
[00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:16.415]  To see if the Seattle Seahawks will be able to beat the Patriots, the cheaters, supposedly, without any proof thus far.
[00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:27.324]  But they have said NFL has done an investigation and so far they have concluded that 11 of the 12 game balls that were being used were deflated.
[00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:28.484]  I don't believe so.
[00:01:28.504 --> 00:01:29.445]  I think this is a non-issue.
[00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:30.045]  Completely a non-issue.
[00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:33.926]  Basically what happens is the officials get the footballs before the game.
[00:01:51.454 --> 00:01:54.437]  They marked the footballs, they checked the pressure in the footballs.
[00:01:54.717 --> 00:02:04.707]  I don't believe a ball boy who's making $10 an hour, you know, is going to stand there with a needle in his hand, take an air out of the ball.
[00:02:04.727 --> 00:02:09.172]  If a referee or an official doesn't like the feel of the ball, he's going to throw it out.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.583]  Now a referee touches the ball every play, sets the ball down, and does all that.
[00:02:14.723 --> 00:02:17.865]  Why did they not notice these purposely deflated balls?
[00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:23.068]  Why not just put this in the hands of the officials and take the teams out of it all together?
[00:02:23.408 --> 00:02:38.237]  Why does it take a cornerback from the Indianapolis Colts to catch the ball and then all of a sudden go, it's squishy, and then they run off, tell the coach, and run up to a press box and then start spreading lies without actually having the facts to back it?
[00:02:38.877 --> 00:02:42.499]  That's one of the things that really pisses me off, but that doesn't matter.
[00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:44.780]  Let's jump in to some other facts.
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.442]  Many other quarterbacks say that deflated footballs would actually not help.
[00:02:49.762 --> 00:02:53.804]  And Aaron Rodgers says he actually likes to have his ball to have more in it.
[00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:59.627]  More air in it than what the 12 and a half pounds is that the NFL says that you should be able to have.
[00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:02.049]  The majority of the time they take air out of the football.
[00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.070]  And I think that's, for me, that's a disadvantage.
[00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.271]  Wait, who does?
[00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:08.272]  The referees.
[00:03:08.633 --> 00:03:11.680]  The referee who inspects them before the game.
[00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:13.645]  They have a set
[00:03:14.412 --> 00:03:15.493]  Range they like them at.
[00:03:15.573 --> 00:03:17.334]  I always like to be on the high range.
[00:03:17.934 --> 00:03:19.395]  Why would the referees do that?
[00:03:19.975 --> 00:03:27.140]  Well, as you all know, the NFL is the number one sport that is bet on out of any other sport in America.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.583]  Millions upon millions of dollars are generated betting on these games, especially the Super Bowl.
[00:03:33.603 --> 00:03:37.686]  There's been $100 million made on those games in betting alone.
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.142]  Now, what could fuel a referee to tamper with a ball?
[00:03:42.682 --> 00:03:52.088]  Someone could get to them, someone could make them alter that, let out air, put more air into it, just to try to change the outcome of the game.
[00:03:52.388 --> 00:03:59.012]  But John Eric Goff is a physicist at Lynchburg College in Virginia, and this is what he has to say.
[00:03:59.352 --> 00:04:06.517]  If you reduce the mass of the ball, which happens if you let a little bit of air out, the ball can decelerate faster when you throw it.
[00:04:06.977 --> 00:04:10.458]  He says, and that means it won't go as far on the throw.
[00:04:10.498 --> 00:04:12.919]  So how is that going to help the team out?
[00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:17.561]  But you have other people saying that if you let the air out of the ball, it will help him out.
[00:04:17.601 --> 00:04:18.361]  Well, guess what?
[00:04:18.721 --> 00:04:21.503]  When you play, both teams are going to be using the ball.
[00:04:21.563 --> 00:04:23.583]  That would be an advantage to both teams.
[00:04:23.883 --> 00:04:30.106]  So they would have both had the exact same advantage if this was purposely done in this huge conspiracy for the game.
[00:04:30.486 --> 00:04:32.987]  This would have helped both teams, but it didn't.
[00:04:33.527 --> 00:04:34.147]  You know why?
[00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:42.049]  Because the New England Patriots used a player called LeGarrett Blunt and they ran it down the middle and they ran all over the Indianapolis Colts and there was nothing they could do about it.
[00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:45.370]  LeGarrett Blunt could have picked up a table and ran through them.
[00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.830]  He could have had a beach ball.
[00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.290]  It wouldn't matter.
[00:04:49.251 --> 00:04:58.833]  Right now there's a lot of crybabies out there because the team that they bet on didn't win and quite frankly they need this excuse so they can feel like maybe I could get my money back or something like that.
[00:04:59.133 --> 00:04:59.733]  Come on man!
[00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:02.390]  This is out of control.
[00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.956]  What you should be mad at, what you should be pissed off at, is the State of Union address that came on last night.
[00:05:08.136 --> 00:05:13.081]  You should be mad at the President because he made a whole lot of promises saying that he was going to close down Guantanamo.
[00:05:13.522 --> 00:05:18.287]  I've said repeatedly that I intend to close Guantanamo and I will follow through on that.
[00:05:18.607 --> 00:05:22.810]  He was going to stop all these never-ending wars that we've been in for ten plus years.
[00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.473]  I pledge to bring the war in Iraq to a responsible end.
[00:05:27.873 --> 00:05:35.879]  After taking office, I announced a new strategy that would end our combat mission in Iraq and remove all of our troops by the end of 2011.
[00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:39.241]  We're still negotiating with terrorists.
[00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:41.442]  We're still funding terrorists.
[00:05:41.562 --> 00:05:44.765]  We're still sending troops overseas to fight in these wars.
[00:05:45.085 --> 00:05:46.706]  He's still killing people with drones.
[00:05:47.106 --> 00:05:48.167]  I have two words for you.
[00:05:48.987 --> 00:05:49.888]  Predator drones.
[00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:53.310]  You will never see it coming.
[00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.491]  That is mind-blowing!
[00:05:56.192 --> 00:06:00.575]  This guy has made so many promises and you should be mad about that.
[00:06:00.615 --> 00:06:03.156]  Don't worry about a deflated ball in a football game.
[00:06:03.456 --> 00:06:04.137]  Come on, man!
[00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:12.044]  There's more pressing issues in the world to worry about, and everybody's talking about the Flategate, and it's trending on everything.
[00:06:12.104 --> 00:06:13.465]  It's so neat to talk about.
[00:06:13.885 --> 00:06:14.766]  Dude, really?
[00:06:14.786 --> 00:06:16.407]  Yeah, I am a football fan.
[00:06:16.908 --> 00:06:17.708]  But come on, man.
[00:06:17.728 --> 00:06:23.833]  I've got more things to worry about than whether or not a football doesn't have enough air in it.
[00:06:24.233 --> 00:06:24.794]  I'm sorry.
[00:06:24.954 --> 00:06:26.755]  There's a tight end on the New England Playcher.
[00:06:26.775 --> 00:06:29.297]  It's called Rob Gronkowski, and that guy's a beast.
[00:06:29.337 --> 00:06:31.759]  And when he spikes a football, it lets air out.
[00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:36.482]  This is ridiculous, and this is another thing that the physicist says.
[00:06:37.883 --> 00:06:41.165]  Goff doubts the ball was deliberately deflated.
[00:06:41.405 --> 00:06:52.312]  For one thing, he thinks both teams would have benefit, though the way Colts quarterback Andrew Luck played, Goff says the overall advantage would go to New England because, quite frankly, New England was the better team.
[00:06:52.552 --> 00:06:54.253]  So stop crying about this deflated ball.
[00:06:54.513 --> 00:06:57.075]  Why don't you go out and make some changes in the world?
[00:07:05.285 --> 00:07:08.627]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:07:08.727 --> 00:07:10.968]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:07:11.148 --> 00:07:25.375]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs, sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
