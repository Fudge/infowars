[00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:16.272]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.932 --> 00:00:17.973]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.693 --> 00:00:19.793]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:21.253]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:22.934]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.594 --> 00:00:27.215]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.775 --> 00:00:31.876]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.597 --> 00:00:44.719]  Economist Martin Armstrong will be joining us to break down ominous announcements by central banks and governments
[00:00:46.235 --> 00:01:02.702]  As well as bank heads to move towards banning cash worldwide and having private banks seize your private funds directly out of your account like we've seen them moving towards in Greece and of course other areas of Europe like Cyprus.
[00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:08.565]  And this ties in with a very important article up on InfoWars.com.
[00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:15.448]  Seven key events that are going to happen by the end of September is something really big about to happen.
[00:01:17.705 --> 00:01:19.887]  Well, I've said it and everybody else has basically said it.
[00:01:20.407 --> 00:01:23.730]  Everybody I talk to, Spidey Sense, is really kicking.
[00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:27.893]  Is it going to be massive war with Russia?
[00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:29.334]  Is it going to be an economic collapse?
[00:01:29.794 --> 00:01:31.776]  Is it going to be a giant ISIS terror attack?
[00:01:33.196 --> 00:01:37.057]  Is it that we know the economy is starting to really break down and the media is lying about it?
[00:01:37.657 --> 00:01:48.559]  Are we feeling the collective unconscious awaken and people that weren't awake or aware are now so upset and scared that those of us that were already awake are picking up on it?
[00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:54.600]  I think in the mainstay, really looking at this deeply, that's the backdrop.
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.021]  That's why I've got ten times the anxiety I've ever had.
[00:02:01.715 --> 00:02:03.816]  Because I don't really have a lot of anxiety.
[00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:05.637]  I have concerns, I take action.
[00:02:06.518 --> 00:02:07.558]  I'm not a fearful person.
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:16.603]  But to quote, again, cheesy Star Wars, I feel a disturbance in the force.
[00:02:21.225 --> 00:02:26.968]  And I felt similar things, but much smaller right before 9-11, right before the big bank crash in 2008.
[00:02:31.014 --> 00:02:42.419]  I called in folks on the Saturday before they found Bin Laden with that fake raid, calling Rob Doo and some other key people and I said, something really big is about to happen.
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.840]  Watch.
[00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:58.407]  And then of course on May Day they announced a few years ago that they'd killed him in that whole fake raid and I realize now the reason my spidey sense was kicking was not in the general
[00:02:59.537 --> 00:03:11.925]  Worldwide system that it was incredibly dangerous and a big deal, but that I would be so closely tied to it with Navy SEALs families and Navy SEALs breaking the news here on this broadcast that the whole thing was fake.
[00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:18.209]  I now know that it made the criminals in the government so mad they came within inches of having me killed.
[00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:23.372]  And that's why I was in my gut, in my spirit,
[00:03:25.407 --> 00:03:28.488]  Even if you're not a Christian or spiritual, everybody knows you've got a gut instinct.
[00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:30.009]  It was off the chart then.
[00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:31.990]  Folks, this is ten times that, okay?
[00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.371]  But it's not about me this time.
[00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:37.532]  Or my operation being in danger.
[00:03:37.952 --> 00:03:38.692]  It's everything.
[00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:40.893]  Because everybody's feeling.
[00:03:43.254 --> 00:03:43.854]  It's big.
[00:03:44.494 --> 00:03:45.215]  It's big.
[00:03:45.255 --> 00:03:46.015]  It's bad.
[00:03:46.535 --> 00:03:47.956]  Something wicked this way comes.
[00:03:50.657 --> 00:03:53.718]  To quote our guest, Casey, that was on
[00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:55.994]  Just a few days ago.
[00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:06.916]  In fact, every morning now, I intend to come in here with a message for the viewers and the listeners.
[00:04:08.177 --> 00:04:09.377]  A heartfelt message.
[00:04:11.197 --> 00:04:24.540]  And then I get in here, and I look at all the news, or when I'm at home, I'm reading the news, and I just kind of get caught in the minutiae, and then I never end up actually getting to the core message I want to put out to everybody.
[00:04:25.618 --> 00:04:28.440]  So I'm going to do that when we come back from break.
[00:04:30.282 --> 00:04:33.104]  And then we're going to get into the huge developments on Bilderberg.
[00:04:33.224 --> 00:04:33.805]  Huge!
[00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:35.806]  That word doesn't even cover it.
[00:04:35.846 --> 00:04:36.807]  They're gargantuan.
[00:04:37.388 --> 00:04:38.268]  The Titanic.
[00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.630]  The Colossal.
[00:04:45.314 --> 00:04:48.397]  Developments on TPP and the over-the-top
[00:04:50.316 --> 00:05:00.524]  Double legendary battle going on by the Republican slimeball leadership in Obama to ram this through over the Democrats and sane Republicans that are left.
[00:05:01.464 --> 00:05:02.045]  We'll be back.
[00:05:02.105 --> 00:05:02.545]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.585 --> 00:05:07.689]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you from deep in the heart of the resistance, FEMA Region 6, formerly Texas.
[00:05:09.397 --> 00:05:13.920]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com with hot topics for June 12, 2015.
[00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:21.246]  InfoWars mugshots featured at Bilderberg Checkpoint, article up by Mikhail Thelen.
[00:05:21.466 --> 00:05:33.034]  After being flagged yet again for a vehicle search, InfoWars reporter Rob Dew noticed the passport photos of himself, Josh Owens, and Paul Joseph Watson prominently placed on the interior wall of the officer's checkpoint booth.
[00:05:33.414 --> 00:05:36.757]  Bilderberger, we welcome the general interest in the conference.
[00:05:37.037 --> 00:05:41.098]  Article posted by Steve Watson and a statement provided to the Washington Times.
[00:05:41.178 --> 00:05:46.720]  A Bilderberg spokesman has claimed that the group is happy that the public is interested in its activities.
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:55.402]  A suggestion that flies in the face of a huge security operation surrounding the meeting and total secrecy in which its dignitaries operate.
[00:05:55.542 --> 00:06:01.064]  While we understand and generally welcome the general interest in the conference, we simply cannot provide the levels of access
[00:06:01.224 --> 00:06:06.007]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:06.027 --> 00:06:13.070]  Check it out today.
[00:06:13.531 --> 00:06:21.735]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore, cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none, and that's what you'll find at Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:28.959]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest
[00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:29.699]  We're good to go.
[00:06:49.844 --> 00:06:50.385]  We're good.
[00:07:09.383 --> 00:07:10.784]  I want more candy!
[00:07:10.804 --> 00:07:11.464]  I want more video games!
[00:07:11.785 --> 00:07:12.305]  Why, why, why?
[00:07:39.343 --> 00:07:40.123]  I think so.
[00:08:23.533 --> 00:08:25.694]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:26.174 --> 00:08:31.435]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:32.655 --> 00:08:43.238]  I was born in the soul of misery and I never had me a name.
[00:08:44.839 --> 00:08:49.300]  They just give me a number when I
[00:08:50.733 --> 00:08:55.317]  To have microchip identification devices implanted into their body.
[00:08:56.157 --> 00:09:00.821]  Got a long line of heartache, I carry it well.
[00:09:04.223 --> 00:09:08.606]  The list of lives I've broken reach from here to hell.
[00:09:12.609 --> 00:09:16.592]  Bad luck wind been blowing at my back.
[00:09:20.406 --> 00:09:24.366]  I pray you don't look at me, I pray I don't look back.
[00:09:28.298 --> 00:09:39.741]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, on this Friday, the 12th day of June, 2015.
[00:09:40.541 --> 00:09:54.444]  Economist Martin Armstrong is going to be joining us from Armstrong Economics to break down an article that he was interviewed in, the secret meeting in London to end cash that ties into Bilderberg.
[00:09:55.441 --> 00:10:04.087]  And you've seen the parallel push by bank heads, government heads, regulatory commissions in the last month calling for an end of cash.
[00:10:04.667 --> 00:10:06.768]  So we're going to break down exactly what's behind that.
[00:10:07.729 --> 00:10:23.159]  And the Bilderberg Group's push, and they're meeting right now in Austria, to discuss capital controls on consumers while HSBC pays $40 million for money laundering as a fine.
[00:10:24.738 --> 00:10:26.899]  And then John Rappaport will be joining us for 30 minutes.
[00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:29.581]  Leanne McAdoo will be popping in as well.
[00:10:30.101 --> 00:10:35.265]  And we're going to be talking to our reporters from Austria today.
[00:10:35.285 --> 00:10:41.849]  Paul Watson, Rob Dew, and Josh Owens coming up at the bottom of the hour in about 23 minutes from now.
[00:10:50.213 --> 00:10:53.814]  There is a big battle going on in the House.
[00:10:55.055 --> 00:11:03.257]  They've already passed giving the President dictatorial authority over everything in the so-called TPP deal in the Senate.
[00:11:04.778 --> 00:11:05.638]  It is now in the House.
[00:11:05.758 --> 00:11:11.860]  It is incredibly unpopular in national polls, upwards of 87% in Gallup and others.
[00:11:16.041 --> 00:11:17.522]  The treaty is secret.
[00:11:19.622 --> 00:11:23.125]  But the Senate has voted to give the President dictatorial power.
[00:11:24.466 --> 00:11:28.690]  Three sections of the 28 have been leaked, the latest yesterday.
[00:11:29.851 --> 00:11:38.018]  And it internationalizes Obamacare, puts foreign insurance companies and hospital groups over the states.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:45.604]  It gives the President the power, just basically across the board, to do whatever he wants.
[00:11:48.646 --> 00:12:04.672]  Puts a cherry on top the de-evolution of the president from the executive branch head who carries out the laws given to him by Congress and overseen by the courts.
[00:12:05.712 --> 00:12:15.536]  It pretty much ends the long degeneration and completes the long degeneration to the presidency being dictatorial.
[00:12:17.876 --> 00:12:22.859]  Still, in a ceremonial fashion to the public, it's not officially dictatorial.
[00:12:23.699 --> 00:12:26.041]  But the office itself is turning into that.
[00:12:26.081 --> 00:12:30.683]  There's a huge battle going on on that front we're going to be breaking down.
[00:12:32.284 --> 00:12:36.506]  Obama makes last-ditch plea to Dems ahead of showdown vote on trade.
[00:12:36.546 --> 00:12:43.130]  And see, it's Democrats that are holding this back, working with the Tea Party.
[00:12:44.184 --> 00:12:49.587]  And it's establishment Republicans and establishment Democrats that are working together to try to ram this through.
[00:12:52.268 --> 00:12:58.211]  Senator Sessions and the Alabama coalition are the final group to be holding up the passage right now.
[00:12:58.731 --> 00:13:03.073]  The LA Times is reporting and they're pointing out that it is basically
[00:13:04.904 --> 00:13:08.146]  A crowning coronation event of the Office of the Presidency.
[00:13:09.027 --> 00:13:16.091]  Sure, still we'll vote for whoever we make dictator for four to eight years, but it is dictatorial while they're in power.
[00:13:16.131 --> 00:13:17.052]  An elected dictator.
[00:13:17.392 --> 00:13:18.212]  Hitler was elected.
[00:13:20.454 --> 00:13:25.897]  But it won't take long for the elections to stop once you make the government dictatorial.
[00:13:27.038 --> 00:13:27.819]  That's just a fact.
[00:13:28.479 --> 00:13:31.321]  It's like if submarines had screen doors, they wouldn't
[00:13:34.008 --> 00:13:41.052]  Well, making a president a dictator is like having screen doors on a submarine for a free country.
[00:13:42.933 --> 00:13:57.522]  You can even have stoic dictators sometimes, philosopher kings, that actually help societies for a short period of time, and we've seen golden ages in different places like Greece and Rome start out of that.
[00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:06.932]  The problem is, it always degenerates very quickly into hell on earth.
[00:14:08.052 --> 00:14:20.716]  And we're not going to start with a philosopher king, we're going directly to special interests that develop and deploy a compromised puppet, who then acts as a dictator.
[00:14:21.196 --> 00:14:24.257]  It's the most horrible political combination I can think of.
[00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:46.296]  It's basically fascism with a bunch of domesticated idiots who are socialist with corporatists above the law offshore who can even escape retribution if the people overthrow the dictator because the system itself is so cancerous you can't remove it.
[00:14:49.217 --> 00:14:50.897]  We're facing 21st century tyranny.
[00:14:51.178 --> 00:14:52.538]  It's high-tech, it's slick,
[00:14:55.154 --> 00:14:56.534]  And I don't know how you deal with it.
[00:14:57.795 --> 00:15:00.515]  Because it rots the soul itself.
[00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:04.076]  It domesticates, it dumbs down, it poisons.
[00:15:04.836 --> 00:15:07.617]  It operates like a 500 IQ space alien.
[00:15:11.558 --> 00:15:14.999]  I mean, there's ineptitude within the system, but that just works into the design.
[00:15:15.319 --> 00:15:15.879]  At the top,
[00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:30.559]  The social engineers know how we operate, know how systems operate, and when they're at the apex of power, they can just consolidate more and more power, vertically integrating it through the crises they create or exacerbate.
[00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:47.466]  Washington accuses Russia of outright lies on Ukraine with a in-Russia's-face speech by Samantha the War Witch Powers, addressed to a crowd of hundreds in Kiev, basically declaring war on Russia.
[00:15:48.726 --> 00:15:49.847]  That's in AFP.
[00:15:52.808 --> 00:15:56.209]  We've got seven key events that are going to happen by the end of September.
[00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:03.292]  We've got EU prepares for worst as Greece drives finances to the brink, Bloomberg.
[00:16:06.152 --> 00:16:07.533]  We've got huge Bilderberg news.
[00:16:07.553 --> 00:16:10.574]  We've got more people having their kids taken for playing in the backyard.
[00:16:10.594 --> 00:16:14.056]  We're talking about 11-year-olds, 10-year-olds, and yes, even 12-year-olds.
[00:16:15.056 --> 00:16:16.157]  How's that for a free country?
[00:16:16.977 --> 00:16:17.818]  The police are here.
[00:16:20.719 --> 00:16:22.080]  You're playing in the backyard.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.380]  You're 11 with a basketball.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:24.381]  Where are your parents?
[00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:25.641]  Oh, they got home from work in an hour.
[00:16:26.081 --> 00:16:27.182]  You're going to jail, sonny.
[00:16:27.582 --> 00:16:29.203]  You'll never see mommy and daddy again.
[00:16:30.083 --> 00:16:31.464]  Did I tell you you live in America?
[00:16:31.484 --> 00:16:34.986]  I mean, anyone who's over 30
[00:16:38.226 --> 00:16:39.447]  Hears this and goes, excuse me?
[00:16:39.467 --> 00:16:41.708]  I lived in the woods.
[00:16:42.209 --> 00:16:43.450]  That's what Joe Big said this morning.
[00:16:44.711 --> 00:16:47.392]  Darren grew up in Phoenix and just ran around the city.
[00:16:51.956 --> 00:16:52.516]  That's what I did.
[00:16:53.417 --> 00:16:56.439]  I could walk into the city, but we lived on the edge in the country.
[00:16:56.679 --> 00:17:02.983]  I had the country to my left, lake to my back, city to my front.
[00:17:09.417 --> 00:17:10.437]  We are a prison planet.
[00:17:10.477 --> 00:17:12.018]  We're basically domesticated.
[00:17:12.558 --> 00:17:22.320]  I don't know how you even reach out to the young people that on average spend eight hours a day watching TV or playing video games in their little coffin rooms.
[00:17:27.162 --> 00:17:32.183]  You know, I said in the first little segment that I was going to come in and basically
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.642]  Just make a statement here on air about the state of the world.
[00:17:41.663 --> 00:18:04.157]  And I guess I'll try to do it in the next segment, and then get back into all this news, but... It's so hard to have a thought that's deep and connected to so many factoids and so many experiences, and then to try to enunciate, pronunciate,
[00:18:07.076 --> 00:18:16.940]  That idea, in a way that's clear, is something that speechwriters, you know, take sometimes months to codify and then project.
[00:18:21.021 --> 00:18:31.745]  I don't have the luxury of a big infrastructure like that to try to codify my ideas and then assemble them in a magnificent structure
[00:18:33.248 --> 00:18:48.039]  So that it might be a major warning sign or a major monument thwarting our headlong race over the edge into doom.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.122]  But I think in the final equation it's that.
[00:18:52.742 --> 00:19:01.409]  If you look at every social, economic, cultural, military, financial, scientific trend
[00:19:02.884 --> 00:19:04.605]  We are going over the edge right now.
[00:19:09.868 --> 00:19:10.989]  The event horizon.
[00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:14.131]  No turning back.
[00:19:16.993 --> 00:19:17.893]  The point of no return.
[00:19:20.555 --> 00:19:22.056]  That's the ominous feeling.
[00:19:22.636 --> 00:19:24.157]  That's why people are so concerned.
[00:19:25.077 --> 00:19:28.720]  Because yes, the world is either on one side waking up,
[00:19:29.722 --> 00:19:31.223]  Or going deeper into a trance.
[00:19:31.863 --> 00:19:37.345]  But captaining it are some very wicked, selfish, anti-human people.
[00:19:40.627 --> 00:19:46.990]  Who want to preside over destruction and collapse.
[00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:48.671]  Stay with us, we'll be back.
[00:19:49.351 --> 00:19:50.291]  USA!
[00:19:50.851 --> 00:19:51.712]  USA!
[00:19:51.752 --> 00:19:54.293]  This is an American president.
[00:19:54.633 --> 00:19:58.335]  Just add puppet, then vote and repeat every four years.
[00:20:09.921 --> 00:20:15.583]  It's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the industry leader, MyPatriotSupply.
[00:20:16.144 --> 00:20:21.746]  Once you try them, you'll know why so many Americans like you have made them part of their emergency preparedness plan.

[00:21:07.122 --> 00:21:07.682]  Don't wait.
[00:21:07.982 --> 00:21:08.863]  Call today.
[00:21:09.723 --> 00:21:15.926]  Usually the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[00:21:16.467 --> 00:21:20.229]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[00:21:20.849 --> 00:21:23.811]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[00:21:24.351 --> 00:21:24.951]  Not fun.
[00:21:25.492 --> 00:21:33.296]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[00:21:33.896 --> 00:21:38.659]  One World Away is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[00:21:38.979 --> 00:21:39.800]  My name is Errol.
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.501]  I'm 74 years old.
[00:21:41.681 --> 00:21:44.083]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[00:21:44.263 --> 00:21:51.728]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your trace mineral supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[00:21:52.108 --> 00:21:58.173]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[00:21:58.413 --> 00:21:58.693]  Call 888-988-3325.
[00:21:58.713 --> 00:21:59.073]  That's 888-988-3325.

[00:24:15.052 --> 00:24:16.754]  Strange days have found us.
[00:24:17.595 --> 00:24:20.398]  Strange days.
[00:24:21.078 --> 00:24:27.785]  They're going to destroy us.
[00:24:29.007 --> 00:24:32.831]  Yeah, they tracked us down.
[00:24:46.807 --> 00:24:50.708]  Alex Jones here back live at the kickoff of the transmission.
[00:24:51.008 --> 00:24:54.429]  I mentioned seven key events that are going to happen by the end of September.
[00:24:54.829 --> 00:24:58.150]  An article on Infowars.com by Michael Schneider.
[00:24:59.431 --> 00:25:04.512]  Seven key events that are going to happen by the end of September is something really big about to happen.
[00:25:05.392 --> 00:25:06.813]  Michael Schneider is a smart guy.
[00:25:06.833 --> 00:25:08.053]  I want to get him on as a guest.
[00:25:08.753 --> 00:25:09.634]  I think I've said that before.
[00:25:10.114 --> 00:25:11.014]  It's fallen through the cracks.
[00:25:12.824 --> 00:25:16.465]  And that ties into EU prepares for worse as Greece drives finances to the brink.
[00:25:17.105 --> 00:25:27.207]  They've had three different bail-ins, taxes, handing over hundreds of Grecian islands worth billions apiece in some cases to globalist companies.
[00:25:27.647 --> 00:25:32.768]  When Greece helped bail out the Euro in 2008, its people did.
[00:25:33.108 --> 00:25:39.649]  They were signed on to this debt that wasn't theirs predominantly, and now they get to have their taxes raised.
[00:25:42.492 --> 00:25:49.137]  And the reason I start this segment with that point is, the more you do what the globalists say, the worse it gets.
[00:25:50.058 --> 00:25:52.479]  Their solutions always make it worse.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.601]  Always put you in more debt.
[00:25:55.181 --> 00:25:56.803]  Always end up making you poorer.
[00:25:57.423 --> 00:25:58.744]  Always giving them more power.
[00:25:59.164 --> 00:26:00.085]  Because that's what they do.
[00:26:00.145 --> 00:26:05.089]  They make themselves rich, while making you poor to control you.
[00:26:05.609 --> 00:26:07.851]  It's called economic warfare in their own words.
[00:26:12.358 --> 00:26:20.802]  And everyone I talk to feels the ominous dread that's coming.
[00:26:21.662 --> 00:26:23.683]  Is it potential expanded war with Russia?
[00:26:24.084 --> 00:26:25.404]  The Middle East is stabilized.
[00:26:26.645 --> 00:26:28.005]  The South China crisis.
[00:26:29.426 --> 00:26:30.407]  Economic collapse.
[00:26:32.207 --> 00:26:41.452]  I think greater than that, it is the group collective that's been proven to be a group consciousness of the seven and a half billion souls on this planet waking up.
[00:26:43.052 --> 00:26:49.838]  Not everybody, but a large cadre across the globe waking up and getting concerned.
[00:26:51.059 --> 00:27:00.046]  Those of us that have been awake a long time see someone who just wakes up and they're all freaking out and we basically are picking up on their concern.
[00:27:00.306 --> 00:27:04.009]  And that's a good thing because if you're not concerned there's something wrong with you.
[00:27:04.189 --> 00:27:10.875]  A few days ago there was a giant mushroom cloud style formation over England and folks thought Russia had nuked them.
[00:27:13.083 --> 00:27:15.865]  Well, people should be concerned about being nuked.
[00:27:16.585 --> 00:27:18.407]  And those type of clouds form all the time.
[00:27:18.767 --> 00:27:20.108]  Why were they concerned now?
[00:27:20.188 --> 00:27:24.871]  Why was there panicking now, when even the media wasn't pushing it as something to be concerned about?
[00:27:26.072 --> 00:27:29.414]  We're supposed to be scared a boogeyman under the table or Jaws is going to eat us.
[00:27:29.695 --> 00:27:31.516]  Things that don't exist are super rare.
[00:27:33.897 --> 00:27:35.959]  Not about real things that could happen.
[00:27:39.822 --> 00:27:41.463]  And so my message is just this.
[00:27:43.604 --> 00:27:46.587]  I have nothing but goodwill towards everybody.
[00:27:47.327 --> 00:27:49.849]  Every race, color, creed, every region of the globe.
[00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:52.712]  I want people to do good.
[00:27:53.152 --> 00:27:53.793]  I have goodwill.
[00:27:54.873 --> 00:27:55.834]  Most of you have goodwill.
[00:27:57.536 --> 00:27:59.577]  The globalist social engineers have badwill.
[00:28:00.418 --> 00:28:07.584]  And people that have badwill towards humanity are directing our development and our future and admitting they're doing it.
[00:28:10.063 --> 00:28:14.324]  And I have a great frustration to see black turns against white and vice versa.
[00:28:14.924 --> 00:28:17.505]  To see the globalists playing populations off against each other.
[00:28:18.945 --> 00:28:22.526]  Removing borders to create crises and then exacerbating those.
[00:28:24.806 --> 00:28:26.587]  Centralizing dictatorial power.
[00:28:28.867 --> 00:28:32.848]  But the most important thing I want to transmit is to people that work for the system.
[00:28:34.116 --> 00:28:39.699]  And who believe that they've picked the winning side, even if it's immoral, even if it's corrupt.
[00:28:40.259 --> 00:28:49.084]  They have Machiavellianly chosen that the end justifies the means with, quote, real politic, a laissez-faire attitude towards tyranny.
[00:28:51.725 --> 00:28:52.205]  And it is you
[00:28:53.851 --> 00:28:56.152]  Who has empowered the evil ones.
[00:28:56.792 --> 00:29:06.936]  It is you who have passively gone along with it, or even aggressively supported it to be promoted, that are going to destroy our society and maybe even our world.
[00:29:09.597 --> 00:29:14.698]  It's people like you that let governments kill 262 million innocent people in the 20th century.
[00:29:15.519 --> 00:29:21.341]  It's people like you that if it kicks off again in a chain reaction are going to cause the death of billions, including you and your family.
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:29.508]  And if you don't feel it in your bones or even see it intellectually, let me just slap you upside the head politically and tell you something.
[00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:32.592]  You better stop serving evil.
[00:29:32.973 --> 00:29:37.758]  And you better stop running over the Bill of Rights and Constitution and other systems around the world.
[00:29:38.079 --> 00:29:40.462]  And you better start doing the right thing right now.
[00:29:42.062 --> 00:29:43.243]  Or we're gonna lose everything.
[00:29:44.223 --> 00:29:47.044]  Don't you have self-preservation in your body?
[00:29:47.465 --> 00:29:57.089]  Even if you're a sociopath, you ought to understand that evil is growing out of control and is reaching critical mass, and we gotta put it back in the bottle now!
[00:29:57.509 --> 00:29:58.410]  We don't have time!
[00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.870]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:01.971]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.912 --> 00:30:05.593]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.619 --> 00:30:14.880]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com with hot topics for June 12, 2015.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.781]  Bilderberg in Austria, the true epicenter of globalist power.
[00:30:20.081 --> 00:30:21.722]  Video posted by David Knight.
[00:30:21.882 --> 00:30:36.805]  David Knight breaks down how the global elite at Bilderberg control Obama, Boehner and their minions masquerading as our leaders and representatives and how the meeting in Austria is the true epicenter of power and the G7 was little more than a dog and pony show.
[00:30:37.085 --> 00:30:41.952]  Bloomberg coverage of Bilderberg ignores attendance of Bloomberg editor-in-chief.
[00:30:42.293 --> 00:30:53.609]  Article posted by Mikhail Thelen at Infowars.com, the first notable coverage of the 2015 Bilderberg conference by media outlet Bloomberg unsurprisingly omits the attendance of its own editor-in-chief.
[00:30:53.849 --> 00:31:05.612]  A video article entitled, Here's Who's Going to the Secret Bilderberg Summit, which features a brief synopsis of the group's 63rd gathering, but also fails to mention the numerous high-profile media attendees.
[00:31:06.032 --> 00:31:09.113]  You can find more articles like this at InfoWars.com.
[00:31:09.733 --> 00:31:15.494]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:31:15.834 --> 00:31:20.115]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.

[00:31:28.377 --> 00:31:33.598]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.

[00:31:36.479 --> 00:31:48.367]  To ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:31:48.727 --> 00:31:55.031]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:31:55.352 --> 00:32:00.275]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:32:00.495 --> 00:32:04.038]  Now available in our limited first run at InfoWarsLive.com.

[00:32:09.482 --> 00:32:25.915]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website InfoWars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[00:32:26.135 --> 00:32:29.638]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[00:32:29.978 --> 00:32:33.640]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:35.281]  hdfirearms.com.
[00:32:35.581 --> 00:32:43.785]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people, they're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[00:32:44.005 --> 00:32:47.747]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.

[00:33:08.217 --> 00:33:19.522]  Bilderberg, 2015.
[00:33:19.622 --> 00:33:25.225]  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:28.147]  We must be cautious in Austria.
[00:33:37.662 --> 00:33:42.845]  We have just massive amounts of huge breaking news concerning Bilderberg.
[00:33:42.865 --> 00:33:56.333]  If you're a new listener, Bilderberg is one of the most secretive, probably the most secretive and elite secret summits that's been held every year since 1954, when it officially was given the name Bilderberg.
[00:33:57.901 --> 00:34:15.644]  Of course, similar meetings were being chaired before that, but at that meeting, the old European robber baron elite, this has now been declassified and released by Bilderberg about 11 years ago to the BBC, to establish the European Union, the North American Union, the Asian Union, and to bring in a planetary government.
[00:34:17.365 --> 00:34:24.466]  At the core of it being an Atlantic alliance, both sides of the Atlantic, to bring in the planetary regime.
[00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:26.209]  We're good to go.
[00:34:45.549 --> 00:34:47.010]  It will not be able to be forced through.
[00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:48.810]  That's why TPP is so key.
[00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:52.332]  It's why Obama has engaged in a first ever.
[00:34:52.792 --> 00:34:54.512]  He's gone and addressed Capitol Hill.
[00:34:54.873 --> 00:34:56.473]  He's gone and given speeches, obviously.
[00:34:56.913 --> 00:34:57.634]  State of the Unions.
[00:34:58.654 --> 00:34:59.634]  I guess six of them.
[00:35:00.775 --> 00:35:01.615]  Or seven of them now.
[00:35:02.115 --> 00:35:04.616]  But he's never gone to actually twist arms.
[00:35:05.176 --> 00:35:06.157]  Not even with Obamacare.
[00:35:07.097 --> 00:35:09.238]  He's doing that with TPP today.
[00:35:10.659 --> 00:35:12.959]  Because it makes the presidency a dictatorship.
[00:35:12.979 --> 00:35:14.280]  We're going to break all that down.
[00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:29.893]  But if I have to codify or condense, crystallize why I am so concerned and why so many others are concerned, it's that things are all moving very quickly right now.
[00:35:33.254 --> 00:35:44.017]  Rights that have been fought for for so long are being dissolved.
[00:35:44.917 --> 00:35:47.458]  Tyranny is making leaps and bounds
[00:35:50.023 --> 00:35:51.364]  A forward movement right now.
[00:35:56.867 --> 00:35:58.688]  And it is very painful to behold it.
[00:36:00.569 --> 00:36:06.512]  Because if you understand how oppression works, and how centralization works, and how command and control works,
[00:36:07.569 --> 00:36:09.050]  It degradates the individual.
[00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:10.411]  It destroys productivity.
[00:36:10.471 --> 00:36:12.211]  It destroys security.
[00:36:12.332 --> 00:36:13.512]  It destroys honor.
[00:36:14.152 --> 00:36:15.913]  It destroys upward mobility.
[00:36:16.634 --> 00:36:17.734]  It is the dark ages.
[00:36:17.954 --> 00:36:19.215]  It is bondage.
[00:36:19.375 --> 00:36:20.936]  It is humiliation.
[00:36:21.556 --> 00:36:22.357]  It is poverty.
[00:36:22.817 --> 00:36:23.657]  It is sadness.
[00:36:24.138 --> 00:36:24.998]  It is disgrace.
[00:36:26.539 --> 00:36:27.279]  It is dishonor.
[00:36:30.861 --> 00:36:32.502]  Not since Magna Carta.
[00:36:34.847 --> 00:36:37.189]  Have we seen something as big as is happening now?
[00:36:37.529 --> 00:36:42.214]  And of course this is the opposite or the inverse, the upside down of Magna Carta.
[00:36:42.234 --> 00:36:42.214]  1215.
[00:36:43.114 --> 00:36:45.897]  This is the upside down or the inverse of 1776.
[00:36:46.597 --> 00:36:54.905]  This is the upside down or inverse of say the Voting Rights Act.
[00:36:55.882 --> 00:37:05.145]  This is the president becoming the front man of a bunch of secretive private corporations that will have total control over everything in the US.
[00:37:05.745 --> 00:37:20.869]  And they're meeting in secret in the Austrian Alps right now and have helicopter gunships flying around with their doors open with federal special forces aiming machine guns at demonstrators.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:42.976]  And Rob Dew and crew marched up the top of the mountain to the military radar station that's right on the edge of the exclusion zone and recorded paramilitary Cobra, that's what they're called, admitting they know criminals are inside and quote, their hands are tied.
[00:37:43.316 --> 00:37:45.117]  And this is perfect compartmentalization.
[00:37:45.458 --> 00:37:51.923]  I bet you money those special forces guys are nice, hardworking, honorable people who risk their lives.
[00:37:53.058 --> 00:37:54.939]  And who don't engage in criminal activities.
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:38:17.453]  And here they are, the best guard dogs you could get, the best sheep dogs you could find, guarding a bunch of wolves, a bunch of nasty, red-eyed, mangy curs inside, who have a long history of chewing, basically, babies' guts out.
[00:38:19.775 --> 00:38:21.416]  It's this upside-down world.
[00:38:24.284 --> 00:38:32.071]  I mean, the place is full of known gangsters, full of mega-banks that launder money, with the bank regulators of Europe and the U.S.
[00:38:32.171 --> 00:38:36.955]  and England, the head of the Exchequer, meeting with the criminal banks they regulate.
[00:38:36.975 --> 00:38:44.041]  I mean, you wonder why HSBC and Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan can get caught money laundering, running drug aircraft.
[00:38:47.017 --> 00:38:49.219]  Why will Covio, why Wells Fargo can?
[00:38:49.519 --> 00:38:56.125]  You wonder why they can fix the interest rates, and they can fix the currency rates, and they can fix the stock markets.
[00:38:56.265 --> 00:38:57.006]  All admitted now.
[00:38:58.608 --> 00:39:00.049]  Fix the gold and silver markets.
[00:39:00.249 --> 00:39:00.769]  All admitted.
[00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:01.690]  It's all come out.
[00:39:02.351 --> 00:39:06.234]  And they're given less than 1% fines, slaps on the wrist.
[00:39:08.156 --> 00:39:13.101]  When whistleblowers come out and expose them, then those whistleblowers get killed
[00:39:15.714 --> 00:39:16.795]  Or they get fired.
[00:39:17.295 --> 00:39:18.496]  Congress is having hearings on it.
[00:39:18.516 --> 00:39:19.797]  Washington Post is reporting right now.
[00:39:20.698 --> 00:39:24.481]  And then they go, okay, you stole trillions, we'll give you a $4 billion fine.
[00:39:28.625 --> 00:39:29.686]  Oh, you laundered $378 billion.
[00:39:29.726 --> 00:39:31.147]  Wells Fargo, we'll give you a $111 million fine.
[00:39:31.187 --> 00:39:32.048]  On $378 billion.
[00:39:32.128 --> 00:39:33.529]  I'm gonna go to our reporters.
[00:39:43.624 --> 00:39:45.606]  But this is crazy.
[00:39:46.968 --> 00:39:49.711]  And I've studied the criminology of these bankers.
[00:39:50.672 --> 00:39:58.140]  They're like Corazon that headed up Goldman Sachs, the governor in New Jersey, before Chris Christie, who made 40-to-1 bets
[00:39:59.841 --> 00:40:13.626]  With other people's brokerage firms, bank accounts of a company he'd taken over and they didn't even tell the people they'd taken it over and then they used their money to make 40 to 1 bets and then it took him two years to pay the money back and they kept some of it.
[00:40:18.789 --> 00:40:19.769]  These people are crazy.
[00:40:21.838 --> 00:40:22.619]  They've got U.S.
[00:40:22.639 --> 00:40:36.429]  Special Forces and mercenaries fighting Russian spitznets in eastern Ukraine right now, with Samantha Powers there today, just six hours ago, giving a threatening speech to Russia on their doorstep!
[00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:40.172]  It'd be like if the head Russian envoy to the U.N.
[00:40:41.173 --> 00:40:49.540]  was in, basically, Brownsville, across the border, threatening Texas.
[00:40:50.925 --> 00:40:52.286]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:40:52.887 --> 00:40:54.248]  She's never been in the military.
[00:40:54.488 --> 00:40:56.189]  She doesn't know anything about geopolitics.
[00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:59.392]  You can look at her and see she's a power crazed nobody.
[00:41:03.075 --> 00:41:06.718]  With a bunch of lipstick on, trying to start a war with the Russians!
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:09.461]  Crazy town!
[00:41:09.841 --> 00:41:10.822]  Crazy town!
[00:41:11.022 --> 00:41:12.003]  These people are nuts!
[00:41:18.413 --> 00:41:21.716]  I mean, at least Hitler knew what he was doing and got his ass kicked.
[00:41:27.541 --> 00:41:29.703]  Excuse me, I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:41:30.624 --> 00:41:31.684]  I study politics.
[00:41:31.865 --> 00:41:33.146]  I study geopolitics.
[00:41:33.406 --> 00:41:38.350]  I interview all the top experts, Nobel Prize winners in economics, you name it, who say the same thing I'm saying.
[00:41:39.251 --> 00:41:41.353]  All the top futurists are saying we're in deep trouble.
[00:41:44.362 --> 00:41:46.364]  So many former generals, you name it, it's not just me.
[00:41:46.664 --> 00:41:49.726]  We're in a crisis with crazy people running things.
[00:41:50.587 --> 00:41:53.669]  Congress is trying to make the president a dictator today!
[00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:58.072]  This isn't some trade deal, it's a takeover!
[00:41:58.232 --> 00:41:59.413]  That's why you can't see it!
[00:42:00.133 --> 00:42:04.556]  We already got three subsections that are so bad, I can't even believe they're this bold.
[00:42:05.837 --> 00:42:08.899]  These people are drunk on chutzpah and on bravada.
[00:42:11.521 --> 00:42:12.122]  They're crazy.
[00:42:13.052 --> 00:42:14.893]  I'm going to stop right there and go to Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:42:14.913 --> 00:42:16.034]  There have been so many developments.
[00:42:16.354 --> 00:42:17.895]  They get followed by police everywhere.
[00:42:17.935 --> 00:42:23.578]  We've got a recording, audio recording we're going to play of them up on top of the mountain, talking to the Cobra people.
[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:31.263]  We've got, there's helicopters flying around with gun pods and guys hanging out the doors.
[00:42:31.883 --> 00:42:35.766]  For like 20 members of the press, they're rousting at 1 a.m.
[00:42:35.826 --> 00:42:42.390]  London Guardian reporters and interrogating them for 45 minutes and then taking them outside and shining spotlights in their eyes.
[00:42:43.755 --> 00:42:47.336]  And the cops even look pathetic and embarrassed while they're doing it, but they're ordered to do it.
[00:42:48.077 --> 00:42:49.317]  I mean, it's crazy!
[00:42:50.097 --> 00:42:54.299]  And then Bilderberg publishes, for the first time in a U.S.
[00:42:54.359 --> 00:43:03.242]  newspaper, a letter, we have it on Infowars.com, going, we are open to the public and want you to know everything we're doing.
[00:43:03.322 --> 00:43:04.483]  Thank you, press, for coming.
[00:43:04.763 --> 00:43:06.503]  A sick psych warfare event.
[00:43:07.604 --> 00:43:10.305]  I mean, everything with them is a sick joke.
[00:43:11.508 --> 00:43:12.008]  In reverse.
[00:43:12.048 --> 00:43:13.770]  They say demons speak in reverse.
[00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:14.850]  I guess that must be true.
[00:43:18.173 --> 00:43:22.535]  Let's go to Paul Joseph Watson from Austria to give us the latest developments.
[00:43:22.576 --> 00:43:28.840]  Paul, please tell us what's happened there at Bilderberg 2015 in the last 21 hours.
[00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:33.763]  Well, I think this day has got to be the worst in terms of harassment.
[00:43:33.823 --> 00:43:35.264]  It just seems to be getting more intense.
[00:43:35.704 --> 00:43:39.227]  First of all, our mugshots, mine, Josh and Rob's do,
[00:43:40.183 --> 00:43:43.305]  are up in the police cabin that's at the checkpoint at the bottom of the hill.
[00:43:43.585 --> 00:43:52.830]  All they have taped up to the wall are pictures of the passports of myself, Rob Dew, and Josh Owens, and a picture of our vehicle, and then a map of the area.
[00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:53.790]  And that's it.
[00:43:54.551 --> 00:44:03.155]  So, why they need that there, whether they're, you know, that's the instruction to treat us better, or whether it's, you know, if you get filmed at the checkpoint again, arrest these people.
[00:44:04.036 --> 00:44:05.617]  No, it means leave you alone.
[00:44:05.637 --> 00:44:06.317]  Go ahead.
[00:44:09.338 --> 00:44:12.899]  So, yeah, we noticed that last night and I saw it again driving down today.
[00:44:13.279 --> 00:44:19.721]  But I was thinking earlier, the last three Bilderbergs that I went to, this is my fourth, I never got asked for ID once.
[00:44:20.661 --> 00:44:29.943]  At any of those last three Bilderbergs, I've been asked for ID here more times in this three-day period than my entire life.
[00:44:29.983 --> 00:44:31.944]  Well, that's the joke about German culture.
[00:44:32.967 --> 00:44:39.909]  When you go to bars in England they don't normally ask for ID so literally they've asked for my ID and that's not even the start of it.
[00:44:40.289 --> 00:44:56.734]  I mean we start the day by driving back to the communications truck to get a shot of the hotel from long distance and within about 10 minutes these police again walk up with sidearms, they came from the golf course, again show us your papers, we were there for a good 15-20 minutes.
[00:44:56.814 --> 00:44:59.035]  At first they weren't happy with the insurance
[00:45:01.749 --> 00:45:02.909]  More documentation on that.
[00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:04.830]  Eventually let us go.
[00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:18.394]  There were two other individuals who were obviously working in that communications radio van who were talking to the police, so we know that that's part of the fake cell phone tower system that they've got here to suck up all the communications.
[00:45:19.094 --> 00:45:21.976]  So we got through that harassment, you know, 10 a.m.
[00:45:21.996 --> 00:45:22.417]  in the morning.
[00:45:22.457 --> 00:45:26.400]  Let's not forget the armored vehicle driving up with machine guns.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:31.204]  I mean, they are really... What about the new stuff with these attack helicopters flying around?
[00:45:31.224 --> 00:45:34.086]  And then Bilderberg's put out this statement saying, we love you.
[00:45:35.583 --> 00:45:40.285]  They put out a statement saying, we welcome general interest in the conference.
[00:45:40.725 --> 00:45:51.210]  So their idea of welcoming general interest is to have checkpoints six miles away, police at the top of mountains, miles away, harassing us.
[00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:55.452]  You know, Rob Duke probably nearly got arrested earlier today, I'll tell you about that in a minute.
[00:45:55.732 --> 00:45:58.553]  That is their idea of welcoming interest.
[00:45:58.913 --> 00:46:01.995]  Again, completely ridiculous, completely tyrannical.
[00:46:02.555 --> 00:46:07.360]  So, after we got through that first harassment, we went to pick up Rob to hike up the mountain.
[00:46:07.821 --> 00:46:17.410]  We wanted to get long-range shots of the roof of the hotel, which we actually got before that, and we caught Cobra security forces on camera literally taking selfies of themselves on top of the Bilderberg Hotel.
[00:46:17.871 --> 00:46:18.631]  So then we got about...
[00:46:21.277 --> 00:46:24.979]  Halfway up, before that, another incident of harassment.
[00:46:25.499 --> 00:46:30.622]  They put up a new map which basically says if you're caught in this zone with a recording device you will be ID'd and put in a database.
[00:46:30.962 --> 00:46:32.543]  It was in German, we wanted to know what it said.
[00:46:32.563 --> 00:46:34.164]  We found out after from a German colleague.
[00:46:34.284 --> 00:46:42.068]  So Rob goes up to the police outside the Bilderberg Hotel to ask them what this map says to get directions to where we're hiking.
[00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:50.093]  Instantly he's swarmed and surrounded by seven cops for one person asking directions politely and in a friendly way.
[00:46:50.453 --> 00:46:55.016]  And they do this thing where they all each stand in a certain position around you in a circle.
[00:46:55.356 --> 00:46:57.598]  So they're all in position to tackle you.
[00:46:57.858 --> 00:46:58.879]  They do that every time.
[00:46:59.319 --> 00:47:03.002]  So after that harassment, and this is all on Twitter and we'll get all the videos going up.
[00:47:03.342 --> 00:47:04.302]  Some of it's already gone up.
[00:47:05.163 --> 00:47:15.270]  So we start hiking up the mountain to get another long-range shot of the hotel and to go up to where the helicopters are taking off and the military radar station for the no-fly zone.
[00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:23.178]  So we get about halfway up the mountain, we meet three individuals from PrisonPlanet.pl and they were very friendly, very helpful.
[00:47:23.959 --> 00:47:30.767]  And it turns out we were obviously being listened to by these mountain cops, because within probably about five minutes of us
[00:47:31.602 --> 00:47:32.902]  Saying goodbye to those people.
[00:47:33.242 --> 00:47:35.403]  We were confronted by these police officers.
[00:47:35.883 --> 00:47:37.483]  Again, the full routine.
[00:47:37.663 --> 00:47:39.184]  This time they searched our bags.
[00:47:39.224 --> 00:47:41.024]  That's the first time our bags have been searched.
[00:47:41.624 --> 00:47:42.845]  One of them was pretty friendly.
[00:47:43.285 --> 00:47:49.926]  Rob started educating him about the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment and the right to a free press.
[00:47:50.206 --> 00:47:51.647]  At first they seemed pretty friendly.
[00:47:51.967 --> 00:47:52.587]  We said goodbye.
[00:47:52.627 --> 00:47:53.607]  They checked our ID again.
[00:47:53.987 --> 00:47:55.448]  We started walking up the mountain.
[00:47:55.708 --> 00:47:58.108]  By this point we were about three quarters of the way up the mountain.
[00:47:58.128 --> 00:48:01.049]  The whole thing took probably about two and a half hours to get up there.
[00:48:01.906 --> 00:48:11.411]  So then we realized that again we're being followed on foot by these police officers on a mountain that's miles and miles away from the Bilderberg Hotel.
[00:48:11.711 --> 00:48:14.052]  They're following us right behind us on foot.
[00:48:15.032 --> 00:48:25.097]  So we get to the top of the mountain or that smaller mountain to a restaurant to have lunch and the police, more police are there waiting for us, the police that were following us are coming in from behind.
[00:48:25.797 --> 00:48:28.319]  So again we talked to them, they actually had a
[00:48:29.815 --> 00:48:35.358]  Dog that looked like a German Shepherd, and in fact they had to call it off as soon as we got there because it was growling.
[00:48:35.418 --> 00:48:37.099]  I think it was definitely a police dog.
[00:48:37.719 --> 00:48:39.540]  So, you know, we order food.
[00:48:40.261 --> 00:48:46.384]  Anytime we walk around the restaurant to get shots of the Bilderberg Hotel or the military radar, they follow us.
[00:48:47.645 --> 00:48:49.646]  And then, you know, we're being polite the whole time.
[00:48:50.366 --> 00:48:54.648]  Rob goes up to talk to them again, being polite, talking about how there are war criminals meeting there.
[00:48:55.009 --> 00:48:59.251]  Kissinger, Reni Benko, the Austrian property developer who just got indicted.
[00:49:00.371 --> 00:49:06.153]  And, um, they start getting aggressive, or at least one of them does, and he literally grabs Rob by the arm.
[00:49:08.374 --> 00:49:10.355]  We've got all this on audio and video.
[00:49:10.375 --> 00:49:11.275]  We're gonna put it together.
[00:49:11.635 --> 00:49:13.576]  And he says, basically says, you be quiet now.
[00:49:13.636 --> 00:49:14.156]  You be quiet.
[00:49:14.196 --> 00:49:14.576]  Go back.
[00:49:14.756 --> 00:49:16.857]  And he wanted us to go back and sit down and shut up.
[00:49:17.037 --> 00:49:18.257]  So he actually grabbed Rob.
[00:49:18.277 --> 00:49:19.578]  Yeah, this guy's a piece of work.
[00:49:19.638 --> 00:49:22.039]  We have video and photos of this for TV viewers.
[00:49:23.258 --> 00:49:24.580]  I mean, and Rob's a big guy.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:27.823]  This guy looks even bigger than Rob and looks like he wanted to have a fight.
[00:49:29.144 --> 00:49:30.225]  What's wrong with these people?
[00:49:30.245 --> 00:49:33.348]  Don't they want the press to cover secret political meetings?
[00:49:33.688 --> 00:49:35.210]  Don't they care about their families?
[00:49:36.071 --> 00:49:38.053]  Why do people love to serve evil?
[00:49:38.153 --> 00:49:39.094]  I just don't get it.
[00:49:39.754 --> 00:49:43.138]  And to be one thing if they just did their job, why be so mean to us?
[00:49:44.343 --> 00:49:46.166]  Well, we're just doing our job.
[00:49:46.186 --> 00:49:48.410]  And they said, oh, you're not international press.
[00:49:48.731 --> 00:49:50.875]  Well, there aren't any international press here.
[00:49:51.316 --> 00:49:52.217]  You know, you're in the news.
[00:49:52.238 --> 00:49:53.380]  But we are international press.
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:56.004]  We have more viewers and readers than most major newspapers.
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:04.884]  Yeah, and we actually hike up frigging mountains to try and get footage for a real news story about 120 of the most powerful people in the world.
[00:50:05.164 --> 00:50:06.545]  There's nobody from CNN here.
[00:50:06.565 --> 00:50:09.227]  There's nobody from ABC, Fox News, any of those.
[00:50:09.727 --> 00:50:11.488]  That's because they got the order not to be there.
[00:50:11.528 --> 00:50:14.549]  They don't want you there because this is the real power structure.
[00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:16.670]  I'm skipping this network break to have more time.
[00:50:16.971 --> 00:50:18.011]  This is just too important.
[00:50:18.631 --> 00:50:20.593]  Paul Watson, it is just mind-blowing.
[00:50:20.613 --> 00:50:21.053]  I want to get
[00:50:22.304 --> 00:50:23.744]  Rob Dew in front of the camera.
[00:50:23.804 --> 00:50:27.145]  So, make any other important points you want to make?
[00:50:27.805 --> 00:50:29.885]  Any other political agendas we've learned about?
[00:50:29.945 --> 00:50:30.825]  Anything else that's important?
[00:50:30.845 --> 00:50:32.706]  And then let's get Rob Dew in front of the camera.
[00:50:34.306 --> 00:50:46.688]  Well, the other thing is, when we left the cops and hiked back down the mountain, as soon as we got back to the entrance of the hotel, where there was a small protest taking place, at least two cops were watching us intently.
[00:50:47.028 --> 00:50:50.729]  So obviously, they got something.
[00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:56.753]  Alright, and again folks, if you hear Paul's voice speeding up and slowing down, fade down.
[00:50:56.773 --> 00:50:59.675]  If you hear him speeding up and slowing down, that's not how he talks.
[00:50:59.715 --> 00:51:02.037]  That's Skype from Austria in the mountains.
[00:51:02.478 --> 00:51:05.220]  Paul, I've just got to say this, I want to go there though.
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:12.566]  I mean, I've been to Europe and to other, I love Colorado, but that mountain valley vista behind you looks like Valhalla.
[00:51:13.146 --> 00:51:17.808]  I mean, it looks like that I'm going to see Flight of the Valkyries any moment there.
[00:51:17.868 --> 00:51:19.308]  That is gorgeous.
[00:51:20.409 --> 00:51:22.370]  Just simply beautiful.
[00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:29.312]  We're showing a pan of this for TV viewers, your radio listener, InfoWars.com forward slash show to add that dimension.
[00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:39.736]  And it is your support of InfoWars.com, spreading the word, supporting our sponsors, buying the high quality nutraceuticals at InfoWarsLife.com, becoming presentplanet.tv members.
[00:51:41.437 --> 00:51:42.017]  We're good to go.
[00:52:03.573 --> 00:52:05.695]  Our reporters have done an excellent job.
[00:52:05.715 --> 00:52:07.316]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:52:08.377 --> 00:52:15.524]  The group of state police down at the bottom quit harassing our reporters once we had everybody call them.
[00:52:17.846 --> 00:52:24.612]  This is COBRA security and then police that they've brought in to be their minions that are acting like this.
[00:52:24.632 --> 00:52:29.216]  We do have some audio coming up that we'll play later of Dew actually talking to them.
[00:52:30.057 --> 00:52:32.141]  And there's video too, but the camera's pointed at the ground.
[00:52:33.063 --> 00:52:38.153]  But, very aggressive tactics, very third world, very shameful.
[00:52:39.176 --> 00:52:39.756]  Of Austria.
[00:52:40.657 --> 00:52:45.881]  This is the worst we've seen even in quasi-Third World areas like Turkey and Greece.
[00:52:47.021 --> 00:52:50.063]  And of course they were once not Third World, Greece was First World.
[00:52:50.284 --> 00:52:54.126]  The First World started there, but it's been taken over by the bankers and put in the toilet bowl.
[00:52:54.707 --> 00:52:56.228]  Still beautiful, not running down Greece.
[00:52:56.248 --> 00:52:57.248]  A lot of awake people there.
[00:52:58.089 --> 00:53:01.091]  But just really, really shameful.
[00:53:02.292 --> 00:53:03.753]  Let's go to Rob Dew.
[00:53:06.127 --> 00:53:07.267]  Okay, we just lost their connection.
[00:53:07.287 --> 00:53:09.868]  We're going to go back to them here in just a moment.
[00:53:11.189 --> 00:53:17.550]  As I was just plugging, please check out the high-quality Survival Shield Nacin Ion X2.
[00:53:18.011 --> 00:53:19.511]  It was sold out for about three days.
[00:53:20.892 --> 00:53:24.132]  We warned you that we're running out of the Deep Earth Crystal source.
[00:53:24.152 --> 00:53:25.613]  We're trying to secure more of that right now.
[00:53:25.753 --> 00:53:30.174]  We said we had a small amount a few weeks ago in manufacturing process at the laboratory.
[00:53:30.514 --> 00:53:31.695]  That was delivered yesterday.
[00:53:32.714 --> 00:53:33.155]  That's right.
[00:53:57.008 --> 00:53:58.189]  But we are running out
[00:54:18.374 --> 00:54:27.102]  I can't say buying this really supports us because it's almost at cost, but this is one of our Lost Leader Specials right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:54:30.565 --> 00:54:40.514]  We're going to go ahead and roll some of that audio from up at the radar emplacement that the military has put in for the event.
[00:54:41.843 --> 00:54:50.084]  Of course, they stick this up there by a small restaurant for the alpiners, and then just didn't like our guys daring to come up and talk to him, and got physical.
[00:54:51.685 --> 00:55:03.687]  And so Rob Dewey put his hands up, we've got the still photos of it, that some of the tourists were taking, and then the cop put his hands up as a joke afterwards as well, I guess hoping that Dewey would do something.
[00:55:04.267 --> 00:55:05.527]  Very shameful!
[00:55:06.187 --> 00:55:09.608]  If you want to fight us, get a boxing ring and put gloves on, punk!
[00:55:10.248 --> 00:55:11.108]  Don't be a coward!
[00:55:13.797 --> 00:55:14.878]  Let's go ahead and go to the audio.
[00:55:14.898 --> 00:55:15.398]  Here it is.
[00:55:16.979 --> 00:55:17.119]  Yeah?
[00:55:17.479 --> 00:55:17.799]  What's that?
[00:55:18.459 --> 00:55:19.640]  You can't walk over here?
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:20.180]  What's wrong?
[00:55:20.961 --> 00:55:21.721]  It's for security.
[00:55:21.741 --> 00:55:22.722]  For security?
[00:55:23.622 --> 00:55:23.922]  For who?
[00:55:23.962 --> 00:55:24.342]  From us?
[00:55:24.583 --> 00:55:25.343]  Yeah, from us.
[00:55:25.663 --> 00:55:26.083]  We're bad?
[00:55:26.744 --> 00:55:27.344]  Why are we bad?
[00:55:28.765 --> 00:55:30.826]  Journalists are bad in Austria?
[00:55:31.006 --> 00:55:31.146]  Yeah.
[00:55:32.327 --> 00:55:33.827]  How is a journalist bad in Austria?
[00:55:34.548 --> 00:55:37.309]  You're protecting criminals, you know that, don't you?
[00:55:37.889 --> 00:55:38.410]  Do you understand?
[00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:39.410]  I understand.
[00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:40.371]  Do you understand?
[00:55:40.391 --> 00:55:41.371]  You're protecting criminals.
[00:55:41.611 --> 00:55:42.232]  It's ridiculous.
[00:55:43.504 --> 00:55:44.905]  And yet we're treated like criminals.
[00:55:45.946 --> 00:55:48.468]  He got our passports, take picture, send them in.
[00:55:48.608 --> 00:55:49.368]  I'm a journalist.
[00:55:49.508 --> 00:55:50.049]  I have no gun.
[00:55:50.849 --> 00:55:51.330]  I have nothing.
[00:55:54.632 --> 00:55:56.033]  And you're justifying it right now.
[00:55:58.475 --> 00:55:58.735]  You know?
[00:55:59.215 --> 00:55:59.676]  What's your name?
[00:56:02.478 --> 00:56:02.838]  Police.
[00:56:02.978 --> 00:56:03.658]  Police, huh?
[00:56:03.799 --> 00:56:05.560]  What do you use, 9mm or Glock?
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:06.100]  What do you have?
[00:56:06.681 --> 00:56:07.001]  A Glock?
[00:56:11.577 --> 00:56:13.699]  So is journalism illegal in Austria?
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:14.860]  It is?
[00:56:16.121 --> 00:56:20.165]  This is your press identification.
[00:56:20.405 --> 00:56:20.646]  Sure.
[00:56:21.046 --> 00:56:22.768]  It's not the international press.
[00:56:23.168 --> 00:56:24.930]  My identification is not the international press?
[00:56:25.746 --> 00:56:25.846]  Oh.
[00:56:26.246 --> 00:56:26.547]  Okay.
[00:56:27.047 --> 00:56:28.048]  You want anything sweet?
[00:56:28.108 --> 00:56:28.448]  I do!
[00:56:28.548 --> 00:56:29.809]  I want the Wienerschnitzel.
[00:56:29.849 --> 00:56:30.570]  Yes, okay.
[00:56:30.830 --> 00:56:32.171]  With, uh, the french fries.
[00:56:32.231 --> 00:56:33.212]  With french fries?
[00:56:33.292 --> 00:56:33.512]  Yes.
[00:56:34.172 --> 00:56:35.793]  He said we're not international press.
[00:56:36.474 --> 00:56:38.696]  There's no international press here.
[00:56:38.936 --> 00:56:39.236]  Yeah.
[00:56:40.457 --> 00:56:43.059]  He said press is not illegal in Austria.
[00:56:43.259 --> 00:56:44.860]  But we are international press.
[00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:45.701]  Press is not legal.
[00:56:45.721 --> 00:56:47.882]  We come from another country to cover worldwide.
[00:56:47.902 --> 00:56:48.062]  Amen.
[00:56:49.924 --> 00:56:51.324]  We're the definition of press!
[00:56:52.125 --> 00:56:56.767]  Yeah, there's a guy sitting in there.
[00:56:57.067 --> 00:56:58.268]  Did he follow you up there?
[00:56:58.428 --> 00:56:59.989]  Yeah.
[00:57:00.029 --> 00:57:01.830]  That's one guy he talked to, not the guy grabbing him.
[00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:02.130]  No.
[00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:04.731]  I just got an audio of him saying press is illegal.
[00:57:05.452 --> 00:57:07.513]  And I asked him his name, and I asked why he was protecting criminals.
[00:57:08.053 --> 00:57:09.734]  And I said a journalist's bad.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:20.007]  There's a road right here.
[00:57:20.387 --> 00:57:21.388]  The road goes down that way.
[00:57:22.188 --> 00:57:23.469]  And it's a pretty nice road, actually.
[00:57:23.489 --> 00:57:26.772]  If those can make it up, we could have probably made it up.
[00:57:28.053 --> 00:57:29.554]  You guys know Rennie Banco, huh?
[00:57:31.616 --> 00:57:33.157]  Rennie Banco?
[00:57:33.838 --> 00:57:36.000]  Yeah, he's at the Bilderberg.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:39.903]  His suspended sentence for fraud, embezzlement,
[00:57:41.744 --> 00:57:43.305]  Real estate transactions.
[00:57:43.645 --> 00:57:44.065]  Illegal.
[00:57:44.765 --> 00:57:46.026]  I love how people talk in fires.
[00:57:46.066 --> 00:57:47.466]  They talk in like a fake accent.
[00:57:47.606 --> 00:57:48.386]  Henry Kissinger.
[00:57:48.767 --> 00:57:49.207]  Criminal.
[00:57:50.607 --> 00:57:51.528]  Who else?
[00:57:51.588 --> 00:57:54.048]  My dad does that when he's in a Mexican food restaurant ordering food.
[00:57:54.068 --> 00:57:55.249]  He goes, taco.
[00:57:55.749 --> 00:57:57.210]  A person who speaks perfect English.
[00:57:57.490 --> 00:57:58.210]  Arms trading.
[00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:59.350]  Back it up.
[00:57:59.430 --> 00:58:00.311]  Back it up.
[00:58:00.331 --> 00:58:01.091]  Back it up one minute.
[00:58:01.551 --> 00:58:02.652]  I shouldn't have been talking over it.
[00:58:02.992 --> 00:58:04.032]  We'll come back and play more of it.
[00:58:04.792 --> 00:58:06.713]  Back up a minute and we'll go out to break playing it.
[00:58:07.433 --> 00:58:08.714]  Go ahead and start rolling it again.
[00:58:08.734 --> 00:58:08.954]  Thanks.
[00:58:10.359 --> 00:58:11.079]  Yeah, the station.
[00:58:11.699 --> 00:58:11.859]  No.
[00:58:12.439 --> 00:58:14.460]  I just got an audio of him saying press is illegal.
[00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:17.260]  And I asked him his name and I asked why he's protecting criminals.
[00:58:17.781 --> 00:58:19.521]  And he said, I said, a journalist bad.
[00:58:20.841 --> 00:58:23.542]  If we get arrested up here, do they carry his dental?
[00:58:28.403 --> 00:58:29.743]  There's a road, uh, right here.
[00:58:30.103 --> 00:58:31.123]  The road goes down that way.
[00:58:31.903 --> 00:58:33.204]  And it's a pretty nice road, actually.
[00:58:33.224 --> 00:58:36.504]  If those can make it up, we could have probably made it up.
[00:58:37.785 --> 00:58:39.265]  You guys know Rennie Banco, huh?
[00:58:41.312 --> 00:58:48.294]  All right, folks, we're going to go to break, come back and finish up with this.
[00:58:48.934 --> 00:58:55.376]  When he brings up the fact there's criminals inside and the federal police go, yeah, we know we can't do anything about it.
[00:58:55.416 --> 00:58:56.316]  That audio is coming up.
[00:58:56.696 --> 00:58:57.697]  This is real journalism.
[00:58:57.717 --> 00:58:59.037]  We have HD photos, all of it.
[00:58:59.557 --> 00:59:05.659]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:59:05.919 --> 00:59:08.420]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:15.243]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:59:15.503 --> 00:59:18.364]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:59:18.485 --> 00:59:21.426]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:59:21.526 --> 00:59:23.447]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:59:23.467 --> 00:59:26.308]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:59:26.408 --> 00:59:31.909]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:59:32.129 --> 00:59:35.610]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:38.611]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[00:59:56.175 --> 00:59:57.358]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.632 --> 01:00:16.272]  Big Brother.
[01:00:16.933 --> 01:00:17.973]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:18.714 --> 01:00:19.795]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:20.455 --> 01:00:21.275]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.036 --> 01:00:22.936]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.597 --> 01:00:27.219]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.779 --> 01:00:31.882]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.542 --> 01:00:35.984]  If you just joined us, Rob, Du, and crew are in Austria.
[01:00:36.024 --> 01:00:38.506]  They hiked up the top of the mountain outside the exclusion zone.
[01:00:38.926 --> 01:00:40.927]  They have a big radar command center.
[01:00:40.947 --> 01:00:43.449]  Looks like they got missiles on top of Bilderberg Hotel.
[01:00:44.369 --> 01:00:46.531]  Those look like containers for anti-aircraft missiles.
[01:00:46.951 --> 01:00:50.714]  They've got attack helicopters flying around with guys hanging out with machine guns.
[01:00:51.655 --> 01:00:54.958]  We've got some footage of the helicopters and more armored vehicles.
[01:00:56.287 --> 01:00:57.908]  And Rob Due joins us by phone.
[01:00:57.928 --> 01:00:59.208]  We lost our Skype connection.
[01:00:59.228 --> 01:01:07.390]  I want to finish up that clip in a few minutes where he's talking to some of the federal police about known convicted criminals inside and what they had to say.
[01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:08.631]  But, Due, what's this?
[01:01:08.671 --> 01:01:14.533]  I mean, I'm told there's some photos going to be uploaded soon and some photos we've seen of one of these guys grabbing on you.
[01:01:15.153 --> 01:01:17.353]  Rob Due, InfoWars Nightly News director.
[01:01:18.734 --> 01:01:19.454]  Tell us what happened.
[01:01:20.474 --> 01:01:25.736]  Yeah, so the second time after I walked away, walked around and they told me to come back,
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.522]  I was sitting there eating, and I said, you know what, I'm going to go talk to them.
[01:01:28.702 --> 01:01:29.943]  I'm going to go tell them who they're guarding.
[01:01:30.123 --> 01:01:30.863]  I was so mad.
[01:01:31.564 --> 01:01:38.589]  And so I was just explaining who they were guarding, what the problem was, and they need to stop, and they need to start making the change.
[01:01:38.609 --> 01:01:40.630]  And the guy got up and goes, no, please sit down.
[01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:41.551]  Please sit down.
[01:01:41.611 --> 01:01:45.253]  And then he grabbed me on the shoulder and started walking me over back to my table.
[01:01:45.654 --> 01:01:46.274]  Please sit down.
[01:01:46.294 --> 01:01:48.636]  And I said something like, oh, is this the soft arm of tyranny?
[01:01:49.616 --> 01:01:53.339]  And I sat down, he pointed at me, and I said, look, I don't have any weapons.
[01:01:53.925 --> 01:01:55.285]  And he goes, oh, I don't have any weapons either.
[01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:57.506]  And there's four other cops sitting there with sidearms.
[01:01:58.866 --> 01:01:59.826]  They're trying to intimidate us.
[01:01:59.906 --> 01:02:00.506]  It was ridiculous.
[01:02:00.526 --> 01:02:02.166]  By the way, your Skype just came back up.
[01:02:02.226 --> 01:02:03.127]  It looks epic there.
[01:02:03.227 --> 01:02:06.027]  I want to go vacation there, but I wonder if it's like this all the time.
[01:02:06.047 --> 01:02:08.187]  I mean, is Austria a safe country to go to?
[01:02:08.547 --> 01:02:11.028]  Should there be a travel advisory put out that it's not a free country?
[01:02:12.248 --> 01:02:14.288]  Well, you know, we got back down to the mountain.
[01:02:14.388 --> 01:02:15.369]  I questioned the PIO.
[01:02:15.569 --> 01:02:18.489]  I asked him straight up, is journalism illegal in Austria?
[01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:20.309]  Straight up into his face.
[01:02:20.349 --> 01:02:21.870]  He goes, oh, no, we have no problem.
[01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:23.390]  I said, well, why are we being treated like criminals?
[01:02:24.088 --> 01:02:28.731]  I said, I'm walking up a mountain away from the exclusion zone, and we're being checked.
[01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:32.833]  They're photographing our passports, they're checking our bags, and he goes, they're looking for paragliders.
[01:02:33.574 --> 01:02:36.976]  We had two backpacks and a little handheld ice chest.
[01:02:37.356 --> 01:02:38.817]  There's no paragliders, bro.
[01:02:38.837 --> 01:02:40.338]  That's not the way it works.
[01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:44.060]  As if we'd get any information paragliding in.
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:46.882]  I mean, it would be a stunt to bring attention to Bilderberg, though.
[01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:49.270]  It's actually an interesting idea.
[01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:50.130]  I think they're ready for that.
[01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:52.151]  I think they would shoot somebody down if they did that.
[01:02:52.771 --> 01:02:54.411]  And get them quickly.
[01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:56.652]  But, you know, and the guy tried to change the subject.
[01:02:56.672 --> 01:02:57.912]  Go up to Austin, Texas.
[01:02:57.932 --> 01:02:58.472]  It's great.
[01:02:58.732 --> 01:03:01.533]  Now look, you gotta stop harassing journalists.
[01:03:01.553 --> 01:03:04.813]  Why are journalists the only people being harassed in your country right now?
[01:03:05.054 --> 01:03:06.194]  Why aren't you going after the criminals?
[01:03:06.214 --> 01:03:09.474]  He goes, well that's a political question.
[01:03:09.574 --> 01:03:10.855]  No, it's not a political question.
[01:03:10.895 --> 01:03:12.095]  Henry Kissinger's a criminal.
[01:03:12.864 --> 01:03:18.108]  Look, they've been told to treat you guys like crud and to intimidate you.
[01:03:18.268 --> 01:03:19.750]  They are in the wrong doing that.
[01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:22.772]  It's one thing if they've been told to go guard these criminals and they do it.
[01:03:23.052 --> 01:03:24.654]  It's another thing to act like a bunch of punks.
[01:03:25.888 --> 01:03:30.170]  Yeah, and you know, we were fed up, we fought back, we thought they were standing down.
[01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:36.452]  I guess the Mountain Guard didn't get the memo that we don't need to be messed with anymore, and they were really giving us the third degree.
[01:03:36.472 --> 01:03:43.955]  And I really got pissed after he started searching through our bags and started talking about the First Amendment, because he didn't like Josh's press pass.
[01:03:44.395 --> 01:03:48.116]  And I said, you know what, we don't need press passes in the United States because we have the First Amendment.
[01:03:48.216 --> 01:03:50.637]  And I told him what that was, and I said, and we have the Second Amendment.
[01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:52.774]  And we have the 3rd Amendment and the 4th Amendment.
[01:03:52.794 --> 01:03:53.294]  I got the number 5.
[01:03:53.454 --> 01:03:54.314]  He goes, that's okay.
[01:03:54.534 --> 01:03:55.155]  That's okay.
[01:03:55.595 --> 01:03:56.455]  He didn't want to hear anymore.
[01:03:56.475 --> 01:03:57.856]  Because he didn't want to hear about freedom.
[01:03:58.056 --> 01:04:00.697]  He just wants to hear how he's right and they're being forced to do this.
[01:04:00.777 --> 01:04:05.919]  And I think you've got that audio where we're being forced, he said it twice at least, that they're being forced to do this.
[01:04:05.979 --> 01:04:07.700]  They have no say in the matter.
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:09.320]  We've got a guest coming up.
[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:10.801]  It's the next guest on Skype, guys.
[01:04:13.541 --> 01:04:14.121]  Okay, that's great.
[01:04:14.161 --> 01:04:17.443]  We'll come back, have Rob do finish up for a minute or two while the guest is on hold.
[01:04:17.863 --> 01:04:27.048]  We'll play that audio, finishing it up, and then we'll go to the economists that's joining us for the balance of the hour with big news that ties into global currency control.
[01:04:27.428 --> 01:04:33.591]  They fix the markets, they fix the interest rates, they fix the currency rates, they launder the money, but now the very same megabanks
[01:04:33.951 --> 01:04:35.672]  I want to take cash away from you.
[01:04:35.992 --> 01:04:37.992]  There's a big move that ties into Bilderberg.
[01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:44.415]  We're going to break it all down with Rob Dew and our guest coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[01:04:44.455 --> 01:04:45.095]  Bilderberg 2015.
[01:04:45.895 --> 01:04:47.055]  This is real journalism.
[01:04:47.095 --> 01:04:51.137]  Listen, if CNN or Fox put this show on,
[01:04:52.017 --> 01:04:52.957]  It would have record ratings.
[01:04:52.977 --> 01:04:55.358]  I mean, people would be watching all over the world.
[01:04:55.678 --> 01:04:56.799]  Have you seen the secret meeting?
[01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:58.039]  That's why they're so scared.
[01:04:58.199 --> 01:05:02.961]  Because if this ever catches on, which it is, they're done with their criminal takeover.
[01:05:03.521 --> 01:05:04.041]  We'll be back.
[01:05:04.101 --> 01:05:05.682]  It ties into TPP and everything.
[01:05:06.282 --> 01:05:08.443]  They're trying to make Obama a dictator today in Congress.
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:15.282]  Once again, I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com on this June 12th of 2015, bringing you the hot topics of the day.
[01:05:15.462 --> 01:05:18.623]  American teenager pleads guilty to helping Islamic State.
[01:05:18.903 --> 01:05:26.425]  Article up by Reuters, a 17-year-old from Virginia pleaded guilty in court on Thursday to charges of conspiring to help Islamic State militants.
[01:05:26.605 --> 01:05:30.986]  The first time the United States has prosecuted a minor as an adult in such a case.
[01:05:31.286 --> 01:05:40.696]  Ali Ahmed of Manassas, Virginia used Twitter and his blog to provide instructions on how to use the virtual currency Bitcoin to send funds to the militants according to court documents.
[01:05:40.976 --> 01:05:45.300]  The world's first penis transplant has reportedly resulted in a pregnancy.
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:50.045]  Article at the Washington Post, the recipient of the world's first successful penis transplant
[01:05:50.185 --> 01:05:51.066]  We'll soon be a father.
[01:05:51.286 --> 01:05:57.032]  According to the South African outlet News 24, his surgeons were recently informed that his girlfriend is pregnant.
[01:05:57.132 --> 01:06:05.500]  The surgery took place just six months ago, three years after the 21-year-old had lost his own penis after infection caused by a botched ceremonial circumcision.
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:08.864]  You can find more articles like this at InfoWars.com

[01:07:18.079 --> 01:07:26.302]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:26.482 --> 01:07:31.143]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:08:06.495 --> 01:08:08.196]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:08:08.496 --> 01:08:14.320]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:14.801 --> 01:08:17.602]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:29.781 --> 01:08:42.686]  Economist Martin Armstrong, highly respected, has been putting out some bombshell reports that tie in with public statements of central bank heads, private bank heads, and other globalists.
[01:08:43.866 --> 01:08:46.067]  Here's one headline from Infowars that was on Drudge.
[01:08:46.607 --> 01:08:53.790]  Bilderberg to discuss capital controls on consumers while HSBC pays $40 million money laundering fine.
[01:08:55.505 --> 01:09:02.807]  HSBC's head is there with the EU and UK regulators of the banks at Bilderberg right now.
[01:09:03.767 --> 01:09:13.190]  Obama is at Congress today promoting, unprecedented, that he be given TPP power without the public being able to read it.
[01:09:13.210 --> 01:09:17.691]  We're going to be breaking that down with our guest, Martin Armstrong, this hour as well.
[01:09:18.151 --> 01:09:21.812]  But he has a very important article at Armstrong Economics
[01:09:24.167 --> 01:09:35.840]  There are other secret meetings with Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University, William Buter, Chief Economist at Citigroup, and others.
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:36.821]  There is a big push.
[01:09:37.602 --> 01:09:40.064]  A public push, but also a covert push.
[01:09:40.425 --> 01:09:41.386]  What's behind it?
[01:09:41.486 --> 01:09:42.907]  Why are they pushing so hard?
[01:09:43.448 --> 01:09:44.809]  Well, they've actually made statements why.
[01:09:45.925 --> 01:09:51.129]  They want to be able to have bail-ins and take your money out of the bank like they've been doing now in Europe.
[01:09:52.069 --> 01:09:54.911]  We'll talk to Mr. Armstrong for the balance of the hour in one moment.
[01:09:55.172 --> 01:10:10.683]  We got behind because our news director, Rob Doob, is in Austria covering Bilderberg and talked to the police up on the top of a mountain, more than six miles away from Bilderberg, and there's attack helicopters flying around, armored vehicles, and they actually put their hands on them.
[01:10:11.283 --> 01:10:12.384]  They would come over and talk to them.
[01:10:12.404 --> 01:10:15.065]  When they asked questions, they said, no, you don't talk to us.
[01:10:15.526 --> 01:10:20.449]  And Rob Due brought up the point that they're protecting criminals inside from the press.
[01:10:20.689 --> 01:10:22.330]  Here's the last minute of that audio.
[01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:26.633]  Then we'll get a closing comment from Rob Due, and then go to our guest, Martin Armstrong.
[01:10:26.853 --> 01:10:28.154]  But here's the rest of that audio.
[01:10:29.055 --> 01:10:29.675]  Embezzlement.
[01:10:31.516 --> 01:10:33.097]  Real estate transactions.
[01:10:33.437 --> 01:10:33.858]  Illegal.
[01:10:34.878 --> 01:10:35.559]  He's a criminal.
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:38.180]  Henry Kissinger.
[01:10:38.541 --> 01:10:38.921]  Criminal.
[01:10:40.385 --> 01:10:41.265]  Who else?
[01:10:41.826 --> 01:10:47.987]  Three people from HSBC Bank paid a multi-million dollar fine for arms trading.
[01:10:48.308 --> 01:10:50.308]  That's the people you're protecting, just so you know.
[01:10:51.048 --> 01:10:52.369]  You know, you guys have to live with that.
[01:10:52.389 --> 01:10:53.829]  We have no choice, mister.
[01:10:53.849 --> 01:10:54.890]  I know, I understand that.
[01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:56.690]  Please, sit down there.
[01:10:56.710 --> 01:10:57.611]  I totally understand that.
[01:10:57.631 --> 01:10:58.351]  You don't have a choice.
[01:10:59.324 --> 01:11:00.925]  Please, have a seat.
[01:11:01.245 --> 01:11:02.985]  Is this the strong arm of tyranny?
[01:11:03.345 --> 01:11:03.926]  And be quiet?
[01:11:04.366 --> 01:11:06.487]  We don't have freedom of speech, I know.
[01:11:06.507 --> 01:11:07.987]  We don't have any choice.
[01:11:08.007 --> 01:11:08.667]  Right.
[01:11:09.308 --> 01:11:10.168]  You do have a choice.
[01:11:10.248 --> 01:11:12.309]  No, we have no choice.
[01:11:12.529 --> 01:11:13.709]  No, you should stand up.
[01:11:14.109 --> 01:11:15.270]  You should stand up for yourself.
[01:11:15.330 --> 01:11:15.790]  No, no, no.
[01:11:15.850 --> 01:11:16.290]  You should.
[01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:17.331]  I'm serious.
[01:11:18.651 --> 01:11:20.352]  Arrest Kissinger, you'll be a hero.
[01:11:20.992 --> 01:11:21.552]  No, no, no, no.
[01:11:22.432 --> 01:11:23.273]  I don't have any guns.
[01:11:23.773 --> 01:11:24.733]  Completely unarmed.
[01:11:25.474 --> 01:11:25.854]  I'm also.
[01:11:30.785 --> 01:11:35.248]  All right, Rob Dew from Austria with just an amazing background behind him.
[01:11:35.768 --> 01:11:40.751]  If you're a radio listener, you can go to infowars.com forward slash show to see all these Skype feeds.
[01:11:41.311 --> 01:11:45.654]  Closing points you'd like to make and what's coming up next as you get into day two of Bilderberg.
[01:11:45.674 --> 01:11:48.276]  I know you're going to have live feeds tomorrow through Saturday.
[01:11:49.496 --> 01:11:52.298]  Final reports live with me Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:11:52.318 --> 01:11:53.319]  with the Sunday broadcast.
[01:11:53.359 --> 01:11:53.659]  Rob Dew.
[01:11:54.662 --> 01:11:54.882]  Right.
[01:11:55.303 --> 01:11:59.766]  And tomorrow we're going to be... They're actually allowing protesters up near the front gate.
[01:12:00.247 --> 01:12:02.388]  There was a little protest going on when we came down the mountain.
[01:12:02.408 --> 01:12:05.431]  There was nobody there when we went up there earlier except police.
[01:12:06.172 --> 01:12:11.216]  And, you know, we're just sick and tired of the tyrannical behavior of the cops acting like we're criminals.
[01:12:12.277 --> 01:12:15.399]  And, you know, I just don't know what else to say at this point.
[01:12:15.419 --> 01:12:17.259]  You know, we asked them, is journalism illegal?
[01:12:17.459 --> 01:12:18.840]  And they couldn't give us a straight answer.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:22.041]  And the PIO's like, oh no, of course, everything's fine, everything's fine.
[01:12:22.061 --> 01:12:22.682]  It's not fine.
[01:12:23.122 --> 01:12:31.746]  You're treating journalists on an individual basis without any kind of dignity or respect while you're letting criminals, you're chauffeuring them in, you're providing protection for them.
[01:12:32.246 --> 01:12:34.127]  And implying that you're violent.
[01:12:34.947 --> 01:12:35.988]  Let's get the photos.
[01:12:36.048 --> 01:12:38.229]  I know the head of Google's been photographed there, Schmidt.
[01:12:38.669 --> 01:12:40.130]  There's a lot of key intel getting out.
[01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:43.432]  It's all on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:12:43.933 --> 01:12:57.701]  So we'll talk to you and Josh and others, probably in overdrive today, but let's get down to that checkpoint, get some more HD footage and photos up on Twitter and Facebook and at InfoWars.com forward slash B for Bilderberg.
[01:12:57.781 --> 01:12:58.522]  Rob, anything else?
[01:12:59.838 --> 01:13:08.443]  Um, I just want to say I did a report up on top of the mountain, and it was really a report to educate the police that were sitting there right behind Josh, all armed.
[01:13:08.803 --> 01:13:10.804]  And I did speak in broken English.
[01:13:10.845 --> 01:13:14.046]  So when people see this report, it's not because I'm retarded or anything.
[01:13:14.347 --> 01:13:22.511]  It's because I'm trying to communicate to other humans and make them understand what they're really doing and what it represents by them being there and doing that.
[01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:24.192]  So I do this whole kind of broken English report.
[01:13:24.212 --> 01:13:25.053]  You talking caveman to them?
[01:13:25.802 --> 01:13:26.183]  Sort of.
[01:13:26.283 --> 01:13:27.305]  And I did it all in one take.
[01:13:27.365 --> 01:13:28.327]  I was pretty proud of myself.
[01:13:28.368 --> 01:13:30.913]  I talked for about four minutes, non-stop.
[01:13:30.933 --> 01:13:32.677]  Bilderberg bad!
[01:13:32.697 --> 01:13:34.761]  Bilderberg criminal!
[01:13:35.741 --> 01:13:37.222]  I don't
[01:13:58.729 --> 01:13:59.832]  Well, it's already happening.
[01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:04.467]  I mean, each of us are little rocks thrown into the pool, and the ripples go on forever.
[01:14:04.507 --> 01:14:05.350]  Thank you so much, Rob.
[01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:07.784]  Rob, you're doing a great job.
[01:14:08.665 --> 01:14:20.075]  Rob is so funny, though, because I heard it in the audio, and it's this phenomenon where folks think if you're talking to somebody from a different language, that if you talk like baby talk to them, or kind of put on their accent, that they then understand it.
[01:14:20.936 --> 01:14:22.317]  And people do it!
[01:14:22.577 --> 01:14:23.858]  Maybe they're right, maybe I'm wrong.
[01:14:24.238 --> 01:14:25.800]  I just talk to somebody like I talk.
[01:14:26.841 --> 01:14:28.963]  But I got so many friends and family that will
[01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:35.637]  If they're talking to an Asian person who's lived in America their whole life, probably third generation, they'll go, hello!
[01:14:35.917 --> 01:14:38.119]  They almost go, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:44.184]  And it just, so I guess with like Germans or Austrians, you'll be like, I know the Führer!
[01:14:45.045 --> 01:14:46.246]  Ein Volk, ein Reich!
[01:14:46.266 --> 01:14:47.126]  Do you understand that?
[01:14:47.727 --> 01:14:51.950]  But amazing HD footage that we're showing right now.
[01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:53.932]  The Skype is just incredibly clear.
[01:14:53.952 --> 01:14:56.394]  That is amazing.
[01:14:56.434 --> 01:14:57.575]  That is so beautiful.
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:00.644]  Even prettier than places I've seen in Colorado.
[01:15:00.824 --> 01:15:01.084]  Wow.
[01:15:01.685 --> 01:15:07.235]  Okay, shifting gears, ladies and gentlemen, from Bilderberg 2015 to what their agenda is.
[01:15:07.956 --> 01:15:11.923]  They've got a private agenda that's draconian, but their public agenda is draconian as well.
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:26.794]  Martin Armstrong began his studies into market behavior, and when he first became fascinated by events during the crash of 66, working through the period exposed him to the real world compared to the theories offered in school.
[01:15:27.355 --> 01:15:30.418]  He became one of the very first to begin forecasting currencies.
[01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:35.043]  He began creating a global model in the mid-70s and was published the results in 72.
[01:15:36.405 --> 01:15:40.616]  In 1985, Armstrong was certainly one of the top premier foreign exchange analysts in the world.
[01:15:41.438 --> 01:15:44.266]  In 1986, Armstrong published the greatest bull market in history.
[01:15:45.117 --> 01:15:59.780]  This was the first study ever written that put the entire world events together demonstrating the Great Depression of the 30s was a global capital flow problem set in motion largely by sovereign debt issues that led to a massive capital flight into the dollar that created a tidal wave of deflation.
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:02.181]  Armstrong's work has become world-renowned.
[01:16:02.621 --> 01:16:07.762]  The model has successfully pinpointed not merely major specific days when events
[01:16:08.562 --> 01:16:10.844]  Thank you so much for coming on the broadcast today.
[01:16:29.921 --> 01:16:36.924]  Launch into your overall view on the economy worldwide, and then get into this amazing article, the secret meeting in London to end cash.
[01:16:37.304 --> 01:16:54.191]  You put this out on the 23rd, and then now a few weeks later, a week and a half later, two weeks later, we have intel from inside Bilderberg that that's exactly what they're pushing, but also the heads of the major private banks all seem to be pushing this as well right now.
[01:16:54.211 --> 01:16:56.272]  Just want to discover what you think's behind that.
[01:16:56.492 --> 01:16:57.192]  Thanks for coming on.
[01:16:58.012 --> 01:16:59.213]  Oh, thank you for inviting me.
[01:16:59.533 --> 01:16:59.933]  You bet.
[01:16:59.953 --> 01:17:00.934]  So the big picture?
[01:17:02.755 --> 01:17:17.443]  Effectively, after they did the big bailout with $700 billion writing checks to the banks, they really have come to the realization they cannot do that again.
[01:17:18.283 --> 01:17:27.428]  So the problem really has stemmed from a structural design in Europe which is absolutely fatal.
[01:17:28.334 --> 01:17:35.978]  And when they were going to create the euro, you know, I can say publicly, I mean, they came to us.
[01:17:36.598 --> 01:17:40.240]  They even took the entire back row of our conference.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:44.342]  The commission was there, you know, for two days, met with them.
[01:17:44.642 --> 01:17:45.763]  And this is back in 97.
[01:17:46.943 --> 01:17:55.047]  And I told him, you know, if you're going to try and create a new currency, there has to be a single debt.
[01:17:56.068 --> 01:17:56.208]  Now,
[01:17:56.863 --> 01:18:03.949]  They understood that, but what they told me then was that they didn't feel that they could get the European population to vote for that.
[01:18:03.969 --> 01:18:05.970]  It would be perceived as a bailout.
[01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:08.252]  So they just want to do the currency first.
[01:18:09.153 --> 01:18:14.277]  And then when those people leave, the next crew that comes in, they never heard of phase two.
[01:18:15.417 --> 01:18:25.025]  And so the structural difference, why it's so bad in Europe, is that each bank for its reserves had to be politically correct.
[01:18:25.529 --> 01:18:27.249]  So they had a piece of everybody's debt.
[01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:34.311]  And that would be like our banking system if it was backed by debt of every individual state.
[01:18:34.791 --> 01:18:42.613]  I mean, if Louisiana goes down or California, then everybody's going to be rushing to say, oh, which bank has the most of that?
[01:18:43.253 --> 01:18:44.754]  And that's what's going on in Europe.
[01:18:45.474 --> 01:18:53.776]  Now, instead of correcting the problem, you have too many jobs now in Brussels dependent upon the euro.
[01:18:54.716 --> 01:18:59.998]  So they're going to defend it to the absolute last breath of the private sector.
[01:19:00.938 --> 01:19:08.021]  And so that's where the real drive to move to electronic currency is all about.
[01:19:08.661 --> 01:19:13.923]  And they see it as preventing you from running to the bank and taking your money out.
[01:19:14.684 --> 01:19:16.564]  So it eliminates a bank run.
[01:19:17.625 --> 01:19:20.386]  And that's their main purpose in Europe.
[01:19:21.403 --> 01:19:29.228]  So, secondly, is they want to collect absolutely every, you know, penny they think you owe in taxes.
[01:19:29.869 --> 01:19:32.971]  So, it's getting to be really crazy.
[01:19:32.991 --> 01:19:42.437]  I mean, you're not going to, with these people, they want to basically take it to the point where you cannot buy or sell anything without approval of the government.
[01:19:44.659 --> 01:20:07.158]  And so bottom line in layman's terms and again a major documentary feature hit film was made about your predictions coming true that was released last year has a 7.9 ratings very high on IMDB the forecaster we can put the IMDB screen up there for TV viewers of the forecaster it's a documentary about you and so it's really scary
[01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:16.585]  Here's somebody of your prominence, Mr. Armstrong, saying what so many of us have seen the signs of, because you know a lot of these people, you're on the inside.
[01:20:16.925 --> 01:20:27.927]  We see them pushing it now, openly, and saying, we want to get rid of cash, so you have to keep your money in the bank, so we can basically bail in and take whatever we want.
[01:20:28.327 --> 01:20:31.548]  That is frightening and we see Greece as a microcosm
[01:20:32.768 --> 01:20:37.229]  No amount of money ever paid into this will prop it up.
[01:20:37.269 --> 01:20:38.550]  I mean, is that what you're saying?
[01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:40.610]  Nothing will keep Humpty Dumpty together?
[01:20:41.451 --> 01:20:54.255]  No, I mean, absolutely every government in the world is following the same exact system, and they just borrow year after year, and they never pay anything off.
[01:20:55.335 --> 01:20:58.776]  And when I have met with them, I met with the U.S.
[01:20:58.856 --> 01:21:02.417]  Treasury during the Reagan period, and the national debt was a trillion.
[01:21:03.624 --> 01:21:09.148]  And that's when Volcker raised interest rates, you know, up to, you know, they were going up to 17%.
[01:21:10.009 --> 01:21:14.011]  And I'm looking at this and saying, my God, just put it into a calculator.
[01:21:14.071 --> 01:21:16.974]  The national debt's going to be at $6 trillion by the end of the decade.
[01:21:17.834 --> 01:21:23.898]  And I met with them and I said, you know, I thought, well, maybe you don't see this or what's, you know, what's going on here?
[01:21:23.918 --> 01:21:25.219]  You're crazy with this stuff.
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:28.422]  And they said, yeah, but Marty, we'll be paying back with cheaper dollars.
[01:21:29.222 --> 01:21:32.084]  And so I said, okay, you guys know what you're doing.
[01:21:32.985 --> 01:21:33.085]  And
[01:21:34.576 --> 01:21:37.078]  Everything is a dog and pony show.
[01:21:39.419 --> 01:21:46.623]  I guess what made me so famous was when I got called in for the formation of G5.
[01:21:47.203 --> 01:21:49.184]  And I, you know, I first thought I made it.
[01:21:49.324 --> 01:21:52.306]  You know, I was one of 35 people in the world being consulted.
[01:21:52.606 --> 01:21:57.409]  And then you get there and it's like, okay, how do we save the world economy?
[01:21:57.529 --> 01:21:59.290]  Oh, sorry, your 15 minutes is up.
[01:21:59.370 --> 01:21:59.650]  Next.
[01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:08.097]  And then they stand up and they say this is what we're going to do and we've consulted the top experts and they do nothing that anybody ever told them to do.
[01:22:09.259 --> 01:22:17.587]  So it's really a dog and pony show and this whole thing is about really their power and retaining it.
[01:22:18.107 --> 01:22:18.468]  That's it.
[01:22:19.329 --> 01:22:26.595]  Well, we see this not just in economics and not just banking, but in every major sector now, with the EU and the US government and others.
[01:22:27.496 --> 01:22:44.330]  They call in the experts, the top people, ignore everything they say, but then say, we've talked to the experts, it's like the Delphi technique, where they'll say, Agenda 21, which is global regulations at the local level, they'll call everyone in, say, thank you, we've heard what you want.
[01:22:45.495 --> 01:22:51.297]  And then they'll do basically the opposite of what the people want, but then claim they did what they said.
[01:22:51.317 --> 01:22:56.259]  Like you said, it's a dog and pony show, I guess to pacify economists?
[01:22:56.719 --> 01:23:02.422]  Or them, when it all crashes, say, well, we consulted them when the economists actually told them different.
[01:23:03.362 --> 01:23:11.025]  Well, in 85, after I went through this, you know, I got, you know, I said, the hell with this.
[01:23:11.085 --> 01:23:13.526]  And I wrote a letter, you know, directly to the White House.
[01:23:14.614 --> 01:23:15.995]  And I said, you people are crazy.
[01:23:16.015 --> 01:23:17.957]  You're going to cause a crash within two years.
[01:23:19.338 --> 01:23:23.181]  Our biggest problem is those in government, honestly, are lawyers.
[01:23:24.121 --> 01:23:24.361]  All right?
[01:23:24.381 --> 01:23:27.764]  With no practical experience.
[01:23:27.784 --> 01:23:33.368]  And they think that all they have to do is write a law, and then you have to do it.
[01:23:34.289 --> 01:23:36.951]  It's not a question of how these things function.
[01:23:37.831 --> 01:23:39.653]  It's, well, we'll just make it do with this.
[01:23:41.995 --> 01:23:46.619]  In 85, forming the G5, the dollar was up dramatically at that point.
[01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:50.101]  The Deutsche Mark was like 4 to the dollar.
[01:23:51.402 --> 01:23:58.668]  And they basically just stood up and said, OK, fine, we're going to, you know, we want to see the dollar 40% lower.
[01:23:59.609 --> 01:24:01.430]  And that was the 87 crash.
[01:24:02.251 --> 01:24:07.815]  And because I went public and warned them they were going to create this crash if they do this,
[01:24:08.490 --> 01:24:09.711]  I mean, a common sense.
[01:24:10.031 --> 01:24:14.335]  You sold the Japanese, you know, everything from Rockefeller Center on down.
[01:24:15.296 --> 01:24:17.117]  And they own, like, more than a third of the U.S.
[01:24:17.177 --> 01:24:17.818]  national debt.
[01:24:18.018 --> 01:24:20.219]  Now you stand up and you say you're going to devalue it by 40%?
[01:24:21.641 --> 01:24:23.142]  Don't you think they would sell?
[01:24:24.723 --> 01:24:27.405]  There's no rational discussion with these people.
[01:24:28.026 --> 01:24:30.968]  And so they just started selling, and that was your 87 crash.
[01:24:31.989 --> 01:24:36.913]  When I got called in for that, I didn't want to go in at all.
[01:24:37.598 --> 01:24:41.960]  And they started lobbying my friends and they said, Oh, you know, Marty, you got to do this.
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:44.321]  I said, you haven't had to deal with these people.
[01:24:44.961 --> 01:24:46.521]  I said, you know, it's a waste of time.
[01:24:47.422 --> 01:24:52.384]  So they called so many of my friends and they said, look, there's blaming computers.
[01:24:52.444 --> 01:24:55.885]  If you don't go in and do this, they're going to come take our computers away.
[01:24:55.905 --> 01:25:04.848]  So I went in and honestly, the first thing they say, well, we're going to find the person that, that, you know, shorted this market and made it go down.
[01:25:05.009 --> 01:25:05.989]  And I just said, look,
[01:25:06.647 --> 01:25:09.649]  Every investigation since 1907 began that way.
[01:25:09.689 --> 01:25:10.729]  You never found anybody.
[01:25:10.749 --> 01:25:13.150]  I said, that's not what makes markets.
[01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:16.012]  There isn't a cow that kicked over the can and burned down St.
[01:25:16.052 --> 01:25:16.352]  Louis.
[01:25:16.752 --> 01:25:21.254]  No, I mean, it's just what happens is, is that you, everybody's wrong.
[01:25:22.235 --> 01:25:25.336]  And then for whatever reason, something scares them.
[01:25:26.077 --> 01:25:30.059]  Then they tried it to basically sell and there's no bid.
[01:25:30.559 --> 01:25:31.719]  That's a flash crash.
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:34.621]  It market just immediately collapses and
[01:25:35.411 --> 01:25:39.797]  It's not that somebody comes in and short and sells, overpowers the market.
[01:25:40.778 --> 01:25:43.122]  You know, that's a nice theory, but it's never happened.
[01:25:43.823 --> 01:25:46.907]  It's just that the majority are long and they're trying to sell and there's no bid.
[01:25:48.156 --> 01:25:51.519]  Let's expand on that then, and then we can go back in time.
[01:25:51.539 --> 01:25:55.241]  It's important, obviously, to do that, but looking at current things, how ominous is it?
[01:25:55.501 --> 01:26:02.366]  Let's talk about the secret meeting in London to end cash, and along with that now is this huge push in the media to get rid of cash.
[01:26:03.567 --> 01:26:10.772]  That's a bold move, but again, let's talk about why they would want to do that, A, but then, B, about the secret meeting.
[01:26:11.533 --> 01:26:14.135]  Well, that's how they pulled this off.
[01:26:14.175 --> 01:26:16.056]  The media is part of the tool.
[01:26:18.814 --> 01:26:24.538]  It was Larry Summers who first came out and said, gee, interest rates should go negative.
[01:26:25.379 --> 01:26:29.462]  Now, he wasn't in the administration, he was just at Harvard.
[01:26:29.542 --> 01:26:35.927]  So what happens is, they can, if the market rejects it, they can say, oh, that's just him talking.
[01:26:36.867 --> 01:26:40.330]  If it accepts it, alright, they're right behind it.
[01:26:40.710 --> 01:26:43.332]  So this is how politics really works.
[01:26:43.893 --> 01:26:45.474]  So what you're seeing right now,
[01:26:46.172 --> 01:26:49.433]  Is the media coming out, yeah, yeah, yeah, we should get rid of cash.
[01:26:50.314 --> 01:26:53.295]  You know, and that is the balloon.
[01:26:54.236 --> 01:26:57.957]  They're trying to get everybody accustomed to it.
[01:26:58.978 --> 01:27:02.499]  And largely so that they can just, in the U.S.
[01:27:02.539 --> 01:27:03.580]  they want taxes.
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:08.262]  My sister just went to go buy a house, alright, to get a mortgage.
[01:27:10.315 --> 01:27:16.279]  My mother had written her a check for $400 reimbursing her for some medicine that she picked up.
[01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:24.604]  And because that was in her account, she had to explain what the $400 was, why it was given to her.
[01:27:24.624 --> 01:27:25.765]  I mean, $400 bucks!
[01:27:26.926 --> 01:27:32.189]  I mean, you have to give detail to every dime you have and where it came from.
[01:27:32.742 --> 01:27:39.949]  They're training us to live in a 1984 economic society and they admit so they have total control.
[01:27:39.969 --> 01:27:47.457]  It's absolute total control and it is scary because I was just over in Europe
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:52.903]  In Spain, they have basically shut down all the retail gold coin sellers.
[01:27:53.463 --> 01:27:56.845]  You can sell your gold, but you can't find bullion coins to buy.
[01:27:57.085 --> 01:27:58.726]  Not even the banks sell them anymore.
[01:27:58.746 --> 01:28:02.588]  You can in Italy, and you can in Germany.
[01:28:02.788 --> 01:28:06.730]  France, they've been shutting it down, and also over in Spain.
[01:28:06.871 --> 01:28:12.033]  So they're trying to kill any potential underground economy as well.
[01:28:13.074 --> 01:28:16.036]  And it's very interesting, but
[01:28:17.498 --> 01:28:19.540]  That's the direction they want to go in.
[01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:21.921]  They never see themselves as the problem.
[01:28:22.081 --> 01:28:22.842]  You're the problem.
[01:28:23.442 --> 01:28:31.648]  And they believe that they can prop up the euro and all these big systems by bringing in economic totalitarianism.
[01:28:32.048 --> 01:28:34.730]  Won't that just stall economies even more?
[01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:46.379]  The economy, the reason I've been pretty much so vocal, coming from the professional side, liquidity is
[01:28:47.529 --> 01:28:48.811]  Absolutely evaporating.
[01:28:49.551 --> 01:29:00.603]  And it is scary, because that means when this thing turns down after October, and government bonds, etc., you're going to see a massive, I mean, collapse.
[01:29:00.683 --> 01:29:01.144]  Massive.
[01:29:01.744 --> 01:29:02.745]  Because there's no bid.
[01:29:03.646 --> 01:29:07.931]  And it's really, capital is scared to death everywhere.
[01:29:08.974 --> 01:29:13.100]  And they've been selling the longer term paper, 10-year bonds, etc.
[01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:14.001]  The bonds have crashed.
[01:29:14.442 --> 01:29:19.089]  And they're moving everything into like 30-day to 6-month paper max.
[01:29:21.812 --> 01:29:23.153]  Because nobody knows what's going on.
[01:29:23.333 --> 01:29:25.193]  Mr. Armstrong, we've got to go to break.
[01:29:25.714 --> 01:29:28.995]  I should have brought up your articles about coming crash first.
[01:29:29.555 --> 01:29:33.677]  I always seem to do interviews this way where the bombshell stuff comes at the end.
[01:29:33.697 --> 01:29:39.659]  I want to come back and try to give you the floor to really spend 10 minutes if you can presenting to everybody.
[01:29:40.479 --> 01:29:51.907]  As a leading economist, highly respected, you know, mainstream articles about your predictions coming true, what you're saying, because you're talking about October, you're talking about end of the year, 2016, when are you saying this crash comes?
[01:29:52.367 --> 01:29:53.528]  What do you think it looks like?
[01:29:54.088 --> 01:29:56.029]  You predicted the 87 situation.
[01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:57.010]  We want to hear from you.
[01:29:57.290 --> 01:29:58.131]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:29:58.851 --> 01:29:59.772]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.252 --> 01:30:01.853]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.794 --> 01:30:05.476]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.588 --> 01:30:14.072]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com with hot topics for June 12, 2015.
[01:30:15.853 --> 01:30:19.757]  Bilderberg in Austria, the true epicenter of globalist power.
[01:30:20.037 --> 01:30:21.678]  Video posted by David Knight.
[01:30:21.858 --> 01:30:36.791]  David Knight breaks down how the global elite at Bilderberg control Obama, Boehner and their minions masquerading as our leaders and representatives and how the meeting in Austria is the true epicenter of power and the G7 was little more than a dog and pony show.
[01:30:37.031 --> 01:30:41.898]  Bloomberg coverage of Bilderberg ignores attendance of Bloomberg editor-in-chief.
[01:30:42.259 --> 01:30:53.555]  Article posted by Mikhail Thelen at Infowars.com, the first notable coverage of the 2015 Bilderberg conference by media outlet Bloomberg unsurprisingly omits the attendance of its own editor-in-chief.
[01:30:53.815 --> 01:31:05.585]  A video article entitled, Here's Who's Going to the Secret Bilderberg Summit, which features a brief synopsis of the group's 63rd gathering, but also fails to mention the numerous high-profile media attendees.
[01:31:06.005 --> 01:31:09.028]  You can find more articles like this at InfoWars.com

[01:32:40.132 --> 01:32:49.179]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:32:49.419 --> 01:32:52.922]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[01:33:03.911 --> 01:33:04.932]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:29.511]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:29.752 --> 01:33:30.933]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:31.413 --> 01:33:39.960]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:52.191]  I've talked to Greg Pallast and others who have interviewed some of the top people who admittedly were involved in the founding of the Euro, and they bragged it was meant to consolidate and economically implode and basically turn nation states into vassals.
[01:33:52.791 --> 01:33:55.974]  The issue, though, is they allowed the countries to continue to create their own debt.
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:01.921]  And so, as this economist was telling us, respected economist, it's now infected the whole thing.
[01:34:02.541 --> 01:34:13.624]  And the greed and the fractional reserve banking going to the next level of derivatives and credit default swaps, it's now makes Bernie Madoff look like a saint, in my opinion.
[01:34:14.665 --> 01:34:15.865]  And the guy was obviously a crook.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:23.403]  This is crazy, and I've talked to so many economists, top economists, and they say it's impossible, it's untenable.
[01:34:23.984 --> 01:34:28.226]  Even people like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, who was in, you know, there as Reagan's chief economist.
[01:34:29.066 --> 01:34:33.809]  So, we're looking at an explosive situation coming up in about ten minutes.
[01:34:33.829 --> 01:34:34.769]  I'm going to play the trailer.
[01:34:35.249 --> 01:34:42.873]  It came out last year, was a big hit for The Forecaster, so you get an idea of what Mr. Armstrong is basically breaking down.
[01:34:43.393 --> 01:34:46.255]  ArmstrongEconomics.com, Martin Armstrong.
[01:34:47.115 --> 01:34:51.697]  So try to condense it all, because I've been asking questions, I've been interrupting.
[01:34:52.217 --> 01:35:08.922]  All of it together, the war on cash, the consolidation, looks like we're going to a feudal system where everything we do is categorized, tracked, and they believe through a command and control economy they can basically prop up anything, which is clearly impossible.
[01:35:09.833 --> 01:35:11.614]  I can figure that out with a calculator.
[01:35:11.634 --> 01:35:15.116]  And then you talk about a crash coming after October.
[01:35:15.496 --> 01:35:19.319]  Can you try to boil down why, when, and what it's going to look like?
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:31.326]  Each one of these business cycles, it's basically mapping it out, and it's roughly an 8.6-year cycle.
[01:35:31.366 --> 01:35:33.327]  And you can go to our site, even Paul Volcker,
[01:35:34.054 --> 01:35:46.640]  Wrote a book in 1978 and was called Rediscovery of the Business Cycle, meaning that the era of new economics, the government could absolutely flatline it and create perpetual growth, failed.
[01:35:47.801 --> 01:35:58.106]  And so what this is, is that each one, the timing remains the same, but what is actually the focus shifts from one to the other.
[01:35:58.206 --> 01:35:59.687]  So one time you're going to have it
[01:36:01.566 --> 01:36:05.848]  Stock market, then you're going to have a commodity market, then you're going to have real estate.
[01:36:06.728 --> 01:36:16.852]  This particular one, which turns on October 1st, is a concentration of capital in government debt.
[01:36:17.772 --> 01:36:25.195]  So, you can see it from the standpoint that interest rates are historically low, you know, at negative levels.
[01:36:26.155 --> 01:36:28.816]  So, just ask yourself, traditionally,
[01:36:29.591 --> 01:36:41.223]  You know, when the capital is concentrated in the private sector, like a stock market, it crashes, the bonds go up because that's where everybody rushes for what we call the flight to capital, or quality.
[01:36:41.783 --> 01:36:44.886]  So what happens when the problem is in government?
[01:36:45.947 --> 01:36:48.029]  That's when the private sector takes off.
[01:36:50.333 --> 01:36:57.659]  So, we're most likely going to see an initial, you know, false reaction and, like, the share market's down.
[01:36:58.079 --> 01:37:00.301]  But there will be the buying opportunity.
[01:37:00.681 --> 01:37:04.784]  Because what's crashing at this stage in the game is government debt.
[01:37:04.804 --> 01:37:06.826]  I mean, just look at Illinois.
[01:37:07.066 --> 01:37:08.787]  I mean, Chicago's a basket case.
[01:37:10.188 --> 01:37:15.392]  You have more than 50% of the municipal governments in the United States bankrupt.
[01:37:15.793 --> 01:37:17.594]  You have the same problem in Germany.
[01:37:18.596 --> 01:37:23.159]  And Germans are looking at adding another 15% tax to bail out the municipal.
[01:37:23.879 --> 01:37:26.281]  And so it's everybody's on a bailout boat.
[01:37:26.681 --> 01:37:29.082]  It's just the system doesn't work.
[01:37:29.262 --> 01:37:31.684]  It was never designed properly.
[01:37:31.704 --> 01:37:39.328]  And so what we have is really a meltdown and it's on the governmental side.
[01:37:39.608 --> 01:37:42.930]  So normally you say crash and everybody thinks you're talking about the stock market.
[01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:44.591]  This time it's bonds.
[01:37:45.332 --> 01:37:45.612]  Okay.
[01:37:46.573 --> 01:37:51.396]  The reason is much more serious, is that you can take the stock market down 90%.
[01:37:52.077 --> 01:37:59.742]  There isn't that much money that resides in the stock market to make that kind of a Great Depression.
[01:38:17.132 --> 01:38:22.317]  The Great Trash, Crash by Galbraith, all of them were socialist.
[01:38:22.878 --> 01:38:26.201]  So they omitted the fact that all governments defaulted.
[01:38:27.042 --> 01:38:28.603]  It's been omitted from the history books.
[01:38:29.103 --> 01:38:36.690]  All of 1931, you have Europe defaulted, Britain went into a moratorium, came out, South America defaulted, China defaulted.
[01:38:37.071 --> 01:38:39.613]  You can go to eBay and buy some of these bonds if you like.
[01:38:39.633 --> 01:38:42.616]  They make very nice, attractive things to hang on the wall.
[01:38:44.255 --> 01:38:48.596]  But we are back at a sovereign debt crisis, and that's what this is really about.
[01:38:48.936 --> 01:38:54.478]  So the bond market's going to crash, and you're going to see the stock markets and private assets rise.
[01:38:55.298 --> 01:38:56.038]  So... Sure.
[01:38:56.078 --> 01:39:00.999]  Well, I mean, Zimbabwe, $2 trillion notes are also going to hang on the wall.
[01:39:01.099 --> 01:39:02.200]  One's hanging in my office.
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:07.661]  Are you saying default's the only answer, or it's the answer because it's coming either way?
[01:39:08.866 --> 01:39:25.071]  It's basically, I believe, what you're going to end up with is some sort of a new summit, probably after 2017, and they're going to have to do something with the World Monetary System, so another type of Brenton Woods conference.
[01:39:25.631 --> 01:39:31.753]  Because everything is just falling apart, and it's not going to be sustainable.
[01:39:32.533 --> 01:39:36.675]  You cannot continue to borrow year after year and have no intention of paying back.
[01:39:39.212 --> 01:39:46.757]  What you have to understand is, when the gold standard failed in 1971, it altered many things.
[01:39:47.438 --> 01:39:50.220]  So, all your economic numbers are kind of bogus.
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:59.286]  If money was fixed, you don't actually have the number of people standing at the docks counting how many Mercedes were coming in from Germany.
[01:40:00.126 --> 01:40:03.309]  Instead, they just looked at the amount of money.
[01:40:03.349 --> 01:40:06.811]  If you sent more to Germany, then you must have bought more Mercedes.
[01:40:07.236 --> 01:40:12.933]  But when you went to a floating exchange rate, the currency can move 20% up, down, and whatever.
[01:40:13.686 --> 01:40:16.889]  The cap, you can't measure trade by flows of capital anymore.
[01:40:45.069 --> 01:40:51.072]  Manipulation that they do has been around throughout all my career.
[01:40:51.092 --> 01:40:58.697]  I mean, largely what they did to me was because, as a journalist, I was reporting all the manipulations.
[01:40:58.757 --> 01:41:09.143]  I didn't say who it was, but I had reams of stacks of tapes of every conversation with trading desks, who was behind what, what was going on.
[01:41:09.664 --> 01:41:13.006]  The court demanded all that be turned over to Alan Cohen.
[01:41:14.016 --> 01:41:15.697]  Alan Cohen was the court receiver.
[01:41:16.377 --> 01:41:21.638]  All of them were suddenly destroyed in the World Trade Center, and Alan Cohen becomes a board member of Goldman Sachs.
[01:41:22.139 --> 01:41:24.159]  So, you know, what do you want me to say?
[01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:30.901]  And when he's working for Goldman Sachs, he's still working for the court simultaneously, which is totally a conflict of interest.
[01:41:30.961 --> 01:41:33.662]  But they do whatever they need to do.
[01:41:34.743 --> 01:41:36.943]  But this stuff has been going on for a long time.
[01:41:37.263 --> 01:41:39.204]  They cannot manipulate the trend.
[01:41:39.684 --> 01:41:41.865]  They can manipulate markets within the trend.
[01:41:42.614 --> 01:41:45.416]  But they can't actually take a bear market and make it a bull market.
[01:41:45.476 --> 01:41:57.564]  And they don't care if things are untenable because they're making so much money because they get to rig the system and make profits and then pass us on all the toxic problems that come along with that.
[01:41:57.604 --> 01:42:08.211]  And then you see the war on lemonade stands, the war on underground economies, the war on Amish selling cheese, the war on kids, 11-year-olds being in their own backyards.
[01:42:08.611 --> 01:42:11.093]  We see this police state forming not just here but in Europe.
[01:42:11.781 --> 01:42:15.043]  And even Forbes said, no, they're getting us ready for a cashless society.
[01:42:15.424 --> 01:42:20.888]  They don't want us to be able to basically survive during the collapse.
[01:42:20.908 --> 01:42:23.970]  They want to make us go under their social engineering.
[01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:25.311]  I don't think they're going to reform it.
[01:42:25.791 --> 01:42:31.015]  I think they're going to use this crisis to bring themselves into an even greater level of power.
[01:42:31.676 --> 01:42:32.937]  Martin Armstrong, what do you think?
[01:42:33.958 --> 01:42:35.359]  Look, absolutely.
[01:42:35.379 --> 01:42:39.041]  This is, you know, politics.
[01:42:39.682 --> 01:42:40.903]  I've worked with these people.
[01:42:41.744 --> 01:42:43.625]  You know, for a long time.
[01:42:44.226 --> 01:42:46.327]  And something has changed.
[01:42:47.748 --> 01:42:49.869]  I was personal friends with Margaret Thatcher.
[01:42:49.889 --> 01:42:53.312]  I mean, these were, back then, they were people that actually cared.
[01:42:53.792 --> 01:42:59.155]  But, you know, one thing about Thatcher, you can agree with her or disagree with her, at least you knew where she stood.
[01:43:00.096 --> 01:43:04.359]  And today, you don't know where anybody stands, they just move back and forth and lie all the time.
[01:43:07.179 --> 01:43:09.721]  Nobody of substance is really willing to step up.
[01:43:09.801 --> 01:43:12.443]  So we've lost a moral compass, we're in la-la land.
[01:43:12.863 --> 01:43:15.064]  That sounds like it's just megalomania.
[01:43:15.104 --> 01:43:15.705]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:43:16.345 --> 01:43:17.026]  Yeah, it is.
[01:43:17.206 --> 01:43:24.451]  It's, I mean, you look at what they're doing with the, you know, Obama wants basically dictatorial powers over trade.
[01:43:24.671 --> 01:43:25.011]  That's it.
[01:43:26.041 --> 01:43:27.702]  Congress to surrender everything.
[01:43:27.762 --> 01:43:33.305]  I mean, we're living in more of a dictatorship than we are in, and it's not democracy.
[01:43:33.385 --> 01:43:38.928]  Democracy means that you should have the right to vote on everything, okay?
[01:43:39.428 --> 01:43:44.371]  But we live in a republic, and a republic is basically an oligarchy.
[01:43:45.091 --> 01:43:48.353]  So that's the, you know, that's the substantial difference.
[01:43:50.543 --> 01:43:55.905]  We're moving more towards a position between oligarchy and dictatorship, practically.
[01:43:57.186 --> 01:44:05.349]  It's not just Obama, and if you look carefully and closely, you'll see a lot of the people that are there are the same people under Bush.
[01:44:06.770 --> 01:44:10.131]  The underbelly doesn't change, just the heads change.
[01:44:17.313 --> 01:44:18.354]  I'll tell you this.
[01:44:19.415 --> 01:44:26.380]  In the 90s, Republicans used to have me go meet people who were going to run for president, or wanted to.
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:29.943]  I flew out, met with the governor of Oklahoma, etc.
[01:44:30.843 --> 01:44:33.866]  And it was really me supposed to be vetting them out.
[01:44:34.426 --> 01:44:40.851]  And they would tell them I was there to explain the world economy, but when I got back, what do you think?
[01:44:40.991 --> 01:44:42.432]  You think he can handle the job?
[01:44:42.452 --> 01:44:43.113]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:44:43.793 --> 01:44:44.794]  Then I got a phone call.
[01:44:46.050 --> 01:44:47.131]  About George Bush Jr.
[01:44:47.231 --> 01:44:50.274]  They said, we want you to go down to Texas to meet with Bush.
[01:44:51.415 --> 01:44:52.296]  I said, okay, fine.
[01:44:52.837 --> 01:44:54.538]  And they said, but this time it's different.
[01:44:55.199 --> 01:44:56.820]  I said, what do you mean it's different?
[01:44:57.301 --> 01:44:58.622]  They said, no, he's really stupid.
[01:44:59.323 --> 01:44:59.943]  And I said, what?
[01:45:00.844 --> 01:45:02.626]  I mean, I couldn't believe they even used that word.
[01:45:03.527 --> 01:45:07.690]  And I said, why would you make somebody president who is stupid?
[01:45:07.991 --> 01:45:09.192]  And they said, well, he's got the name.
[01:45:10.271 --> 01:45:15.514]  And then I was actually offered if I would be the chief economist in the White House.
[01:45:15.794 --> 01:45:16.954]  And I said, you got to be kidding.
[01:45:17.014 --> 01:45:17.875]  I'm uninterested.
[01:45:18.435 --> 01:45:19.776]  I got a business I'm running here.
[01:45:19.796 --> 01:45:22.857]  Do I have to give that up for it to work for two years?
[01:45:23.097 --> 01:45:23.838]  I mean, no way.
[01:45:24.898 --> 01:45:30.821]  And they said they needed people that were qualified to surround him.
[01:45:32.131 --> 01:45:33.452]  Now, you look at Obama.
[01:45:33.592 --> 01:45:35.173]  It's the exact same pattern.
[01:45:35.573 --> 01:45:38.974]  He doesn't attend more than 60% of his daily briefings.
[01:45:39.014 --> 01:45:40.815]  He's on vacation five months out of the year.
[01:45:40.855 --> 01:45:43.156]  He plays golf the rest of the time and watches SportsCenter.
[01:45:43.957 --> 01:45:44.937]  It's the same thing.
[01:45:44.957 --> 01:45:50.400]  The people in the underbelly, once they got the taste of power,
[01:45:54.184 --> 01:46:02.366]  I'm glad you're bringing this up because you're kind of quantifying something I've noticed.
[01:46:02.766 --> 01:46:12.929]  It's almost like a dictatorship of the power behind the throne and the political class is really now shopping for total puppets.
[01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:14.090]  Because it's true!
[01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:21.354]  Used to we had corruption and problems, but overall folks wanted prosperity, wanted basic freedom, didn't want to wreck the country.
[01:46:21.874 --> 01:46:29.759]  Now it's a bunch of crazed political hacks who now give themselves TV shows on CNN, MSNBC and everywhere.
[01:46:30.059 --> 01:46:31.620]  It doesn't matter if they kill the ratings.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.101]  No one wants to look at them.
[01:46:33.461 --> 01:46:37.163]  They don't have any good information, but they're egomaniacs.
[01:46:37.223 --> 01:46:38.144]  They're now on air.
[01:46:39.064 --> 01:46:39.945]  It's really scary.
[01:46:40.834 --> 01:46:41.134]  It is.
[01:46:41.894 --> 01:46:43.555]  It's a sad state of affairs.
[01:46:43.955 --> 01:46:53.519]  And I mean, even with my movie, it's been, you know, a blockbuster everywhere outside the country.
[01:46:53.539 --> 01:46:57.341]  It made the nightly news in Germany.
[01:46:59.162 --> 01:47:01.262]  I was handed flowers in Dresden.
[01:47:01.603 --> 01:47:02.883]  I mean, it was just amazing.
[01:47:03.303 --> 01:47:04.984]  Yet it's not being shown in where?
[01:47:05.184 --> 01:47:05.844]  United States.
[01:47:05.944 --> 01:47:07.005]  Where's the other country?
[01:47:07.085 --> 01:47:07.505]  Switzerland.
[01:47:08.393 --> 01:47:13.846]  But it's being considered to be shown in Moscow by the Kremlin and also in China.
[01:47:14.006 --> 01:47:18.416]  So we talk about how North Korea was blocking the film, well the United States does the same thing.
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:25.722]  Well, they've always had political pundits on the news, but now it's almost all that's there spewing doublespeak.
[01:47:25.802 --> 01:47:32.865]  I mean, Gibbs got on MSNBC and admitted he was told to say there was no drone program when it was public for years.
[01:47:33.265 --> 01:47:35.605]  It's like denying that the Atlantic Ocean exists.
[01:47:35.625 --> 01:47:42.168]  Speaking of your film, which is a blockbuster around the world, has very, very high ratings, really breaks it all down.
[01:47:42.768 --> 01:47:48.390]  Here is the forecaster of the film about this gentleman, which is now available on Blu-ray and DVD.
[01:47:48.430 --> 01:47:48.770]  Here it is.
[01:47:51.838 --> 01:47:54.083]  It starts in August of 1999.
[01:47:54.263 --> 01:47:57.310]  Yeltsin's gonna run for election in 2000.
[01:47:57.350 --> 01:48:00.917]  They get Yeltsin to take $7 billion from the IMF loans.
[01:48:06.343 --> 01:48:07.883]  Now they threaten Yeltsin.
[01:48:08.464 --> 01:48:10.265]  You're not going to run for election in 2000.
[01:48:10.485 --> 01:48:14.867]  Otherwise all this is going to come out that you stole $7 billion from the IMF.
[01:48:15.527 --> 01:48:19.249]  This is how Putin gets in.
[01:48:28.638 --> 01:48:30.219]  We all know something is wrong.
[01:48:30.819 --> 01:48:36.662]  The reason we have this crisis is because since World War II, they basically borrow year after year.
[01:48:37.183 --> 01:48:38.423]  He didn't want to go to college.
[01:48:38.663 --> 01:48:40.364]  His father said, you gotta do something.
[01:48:40.464 --> 01:48:43.506]  So he enrolled him in RCA Computer Store.
[01:48:43.726 --> 01:48:49.311]  I thought I could create a system that stores the knowledge of centuries to predict the future.
[01:48:49.431 --> 01:48:55.235]  The entire trading community would scramble to see the signals as soon as they were released.
[01:48:55.255 --> 01:48:58.958]  He predicted the top in the Nikkei Index.
[01:48:59.219 --> 01:49:02.261]  Universal Bank of Lebanon says, listen, could you make a model?
[01:49:02.761 --> 01:49:06.825]  And the computer says, your country is going to completely fall apart in eight days.
[01:49:07.305 --> 01:49:09.226]  Obviously, that prediction was correct.
[01:49:09.746 --> 01:49:14.488]  They realized that the model could forecast the rise or fall of a nation.
[01:49:15.328 --> 01:49:17.950]  They wanted that source code, which is text.
[01:49:18.130 --> 01:49:19.030]  We want the source code.
[01:49:21.371 --> 01:49:22.532]  I said, not getting it.
[01:49:23.232 --> 01:49:23.512]  Sorry.
[01:49:26.212 --> 01:49:29.635]  The government came in, they shut down everything, seized all the accounts.
[01:49:30.076 --> 01:49:33.159]  I had friends, they said we put up the money, in cash, tonight.
[01:49:33.799 --> 01:49:35.581]  He's held with the worst of the worst.
[01:49:35.921 --> 01:49:40.686]  He wasn't backing down, and, uh, didn't seem like they were either.
[01:49:41.907 --> 01:49:47.353]  And he said to his mom, they want what I've spent my entire life developing, and I'm not giving it to them.
[01:49:55.493 --> 01:49:55.994]  Forecaster.
[01:49:56.995 --> 01:49:59.458]  And of course I tend to do things backwards on radio.
[01:49:59.959 --> 01:50:01.821]  I won't plug something's coming up.
[01:50:01.861 --> 01:50:03.423]  I'll just cover it right then at that point.
[01:50:04.164 --> 01:50:10.111]  Or I will introduce somebody and not get to the meat of how they've been persecuted and basically attacked.
[01:50:10.131 --> 01:50:11.133]  We should have Martin Armstrong
[01:50:11.573 --> 01:50:15.734]  Back on in the future for a whole hour to talk about the film itself and the things he went through.
[01:50:16.514 --> 01:50:18.795]  I've seen a replay of this over and over again.
[01:50:19.695 --> 01:50:27.017]  And of course, you mentioned 9-11 and then your research and evidence of fraud in the system being destroyed there.
[01:50:27.958 --> 01:50:32.299]  Clearly, though, we're moving into a more totalitarian system right now.
[01:50:32.879 --> 01:50:36.420]  Smart elites don't want a totalitarian system because they know it tends to destroy them.
[01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:41.503]  I think we've got a bunch of reckless people in control now who aren't as smart as they think.
[01:50:41.523 --> 01:50:43.244]  We're going to break with the final segment, Martin.
[01:50:43.544 --> 01:50:46.606]  When we come back, I want to ask you, do you agree with that statement?
[01:50:46.846 --> 01:50:50.029]  What do you say about the world power structure, and where is it going?
[01:50:50.509 --> 01:50:52.270]  ArmstrongEconomics.com.
[01:50:52.350 --> 01:50:53.171]  Martin Armstrong.
[01:50:54.031 --> 01:50:56.616]  is our guest and he sees a big crash coming.
[01:50:56.676 --> 01:51:01.163]  We'll get more from him on exactly how he sees that going down and what it could look like.
[01:51:01.504 --> 01:51:02.285]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.565 --> 01:51:06.933]  This is the front lines of the worldwide info war to restore freedom.
[01:51:09.943 --> 01:51:14.006]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:14.047 --> 01:51:17.049]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:17.249 --> 01:51:18.590]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:18.871 --> 01:51:21.933]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:22.213 --> 01:51:23.174]  Infidel Body Armor.

[01:52:12.798 --> 01:52:14.481]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[01:52:14.561 --> 01:52:16.384]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?

[01:54:03.630 --> 01:54:04.091]  Riders on the storm.
[01:54:04.111 --> 01:54:04.651]  Riders on the storm.
[01:54:04.671 --> 01:54:05.792]  Into this house we're born.
[01:54:05.812 --> 01:54:06.652]  Into this world we're thrown.
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:38.503]  We've got on screen from C-SPAN, a TV viewer for radio listeners,
[01:55:00.006 --> 01:55:05.449]  Our reporter John Bowne is tracking the votes and he says it looks like it's failing right now.
[01:55:08.071 --> 01:55:13.614]  We've got 213 yay and 203 nay.
[01:55:13.654 --> 01:55:19.097]  We're going to try to break that down and see exactly what's unfolding there.
[01:55:20.858 --> 01:55:22.379]  Bowne says that's the numbers he's got.
[01:55:22.639 --> 01:55:23.639]  I'm confused by that.
[01:55:23.679 --> 01:55:24.660]  We're going to assess that.
[01:55:26.598 --> 01:55:27.759]  That's a big deal, though.
[01:55:28.439 --> 01:55:29.480]  We'll continue to track it.
[01:55:30.741 --> 01:55:34.383]  Going back to our guest, Martin Armstrong, Armstrong Economics.
[01:55:37.865 --> 01:55:39.306]  Is the elite getting more corrupt?
[01:55:39.386 --> 01:55:41.187]  Have they chosen totalitarianism?
[01:55:41.647 --> 01:55:42.908]  Or what has changed?
[01:55:46.890 --> 01:55:52.854]  Well, not so much the private elite as it is just those in government.
[01:55:53.334 --> 01:55:56.316]  And there is a significant difference
[01:55:57.199 --> 01:56:00.940]  I think the banks have gone simply too far.
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:14.884]  And the real problem that has unfolded is when Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs moved to get rid of Glass-Segal.
[01:56:14.904 --> 01:56:20.405]  The reason he wanted to do that was that they make more money trading than they do lending.
[01:56:21.325 --> 01:56:24.106]  So whereas before it was more fractional banking,
[01:56:25.071 --> 01:56:28.754]  You can see the Fed has created excess reserves.
[01:56:28.774 --> 01:56:31.737]  There's over two and a half trillion dollars sitting there by the banks.
[01:56:31.757 --> 01:56:32.537]  They're not lending.
[01:56:33.318 --> 01:56:39.503]  What they are doing is, you know, they're just trading, and that's where this manipulation of markets and stuff is coming from.
[01:56:40.204 --> 01:56:52.053]  Because why would you, you know, lend money for 15 years and hope everything works out okay with the guy, when you can just trade and manipulate, you know, LIBOR back and forth and just make a fortune?
[01:56:52.534 --> 01:56:54.075]  You don't have the risk.
[01:56:54.793 --> 01:56:59.175]  So, what they did, they sold that idea to Congress.
[01:56:59.295 --> 01:57:00.515]  That's how they repealed it.
[01:57:01.275 --> 01:57:09.939]  They said, if they would just lend money, like the CDOs, etc., but then they would resell it.
[01:57:10.099 --> 01:57:15.120]  So therefore, if the people failed, hey, it's not on the bank, it would make the bank stronger.
[01:57:16.401 --> 01:57:18.742]  The theory sounded good.
[01:57:18.982 --> 01:57:20.862]  They repealed Glass-Steagall with that.
[01:57:22.731 --> 01:57:28.114]  They blew up with trading, and that's the problem.
[01:57:28.374 --> 01:57:34.278]  If it were just fractional banking, the economy wouldn't be as desperate as it is today.
[01:57:35.118 --> 01:57:42.463]  If you physically lend money to create a small business, etc., you're creating jobs.
[01:57:43.503 --> 01:57:48.066]  When you're just taking the same amount of money and you're just manipulating LIBOR, you're not doing anything.
[01:57:49.025 --> 01:57:52.107]  So, you're putting money in your pocket, but you're not helping the economy.
[01:57:52.187 --> 01:58:06.435]  So, at this point in time, the politicians are in a mode just trying to retain power, and they're not interested, really, in bailing out the banks.
[01:58:06.615 --> 01:58:14.340]  They've just allowed the banks, at this point, to be bail-ins, but they realize that they're going to lose power unless they
[01:58:15.140 --> 01:58:16.081]  Shut down cash.
[01:58:16.341 --> 01:58:17.742]  This is their view.
[01:58:17.922 --> 01:58:18.122]  Sure.
[01:58:18.182 --> 01:58:19.863]  Mr. Armstrong, I know you probably got to go.
[01:58:19.883 --> 01:58:20.963]  We have a 70-second break.
[01:58:21.003 --> 01:58:25.986]  If you can hold over, I'd like to give you a few minutes to finish up and also talk a bit about the film.
[01:58:26.006 --> 01:58:26.487]  Can you do that?
[01:58:26.987 --> 01:58:27.287]  Sure.
[01:58:27.507 --> 01:58:27.907]  All right, great.
[01:58:28.428 --> 01:58:32.650]  It is confirmed they were voting on another section, another one of the trade authorities.
[01:58:32.670 --> 01:58:34.111]  There's the TAA and the TPA.
[01:58:34.431 --> 01:58:37.413]  The major Obama-backed trade bill has felled in the House.
[01:58:38.584 --> 01:58:40.165]  This is super news.
[01:58:40.205 --> 01:58:44.588]  This shows America still has a pulse and is struggling for its life.
[01:58:44.928 --> 01:58:45.989]  Thank God!
[01:58:46.369 --> 01:58:47.169]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.710]  Stay with us.
[01:58:50.051 --> 01:58:53.713]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:59.369 --> 01:59:15.796]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website InfoWars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[01:59:16.036 --> 01:59:19.538]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[01:59:19.878 --> 01:59:23.540]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:25.181]  hdfirearms.com.

[02:00:01.932 --> 02:00:04.556]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:15.572 --> 02:00:20.740]  Alright, I'm cutting the intro out.
[02:00:20.760 --> 02:00:22.082]  This news is so important.
[02:00:22.122 --> 02:00:23.524]  Martin Armstrong is our guest.
[02:00:23.564 --> 02:00:29.694]  Can't wait to have him back up for a full hour to talk about his amazing experiences and the film about him, The Forecaster.
[02:00:31.112 --> 02:00:36.076]  The TPA, Obama-backed trade bill has failed in the House.
[02:00:36.476 --> 02:00:41.179]  But they'll try to bring it back, and there's other trade bills that are connected to it they're trying to ram through right now.
[02:00:41.620 --> 02:00:43.001]  They're voting on those right now.
[02:00:43.121 --> 02:00:47.724]  But I actually started getting tears in my eyes of joy to hear this.
[02:00:50.666 --> 02:00:52.128]  And they may try to ram it through again.
[02:00:52.168 --> 02:00:53.990]  If they try to ram it through, we'll fight it.
[02:00:54.010 --> 02:00:57.133]  If they do ram it through, we'll fight to stop its implementation.
[02:00:57.694 --> 02:01:01.298]  But House Democrats delivered a stinging defeat to Obama's trade agenda.
[02:01:02.018 --> 02:01:03.540]  See, that's where the Democrats are good.
[02:01:04.901 --> 02:01:11.629]  When a vast majority voted to derail legislation designed to help him advance a sweeping deal with 11 Pacific Rim nations.
[02:01:11.649 --> 02:01:12.510]  That's because it's not that.
[02:01:13.434 --> 02:01:16.137]  It just gives him dictatorial power and a bunch of foreign corporations.
[02:01:16.617 --> 02:01:17.698]  That is super news.
[02:01:17.778 --> 02:01:22.203]  John Bowne has been remote today watching the whole thing.
[02:01:22.263 --> 02:01:23.644]  He's going to call in the next segment.
[02:01:23.964 --> 02:01:27.388]  Then John Rappaport joins us via video Skype with more on Bilderberg.
[02:01:27.448 --> 02:01:28.609]  Leanne McAdoo is coming in.
[02:01:29.189 --> 02:01:36.577]  But Martin Armstrong, how positive of the news is this that the Democrats bucked Obama
[02:01:37.097 --> 02:01:45.259]  And even teaming up with a slimy Republican leadership, I mean, to see Democrats teamed up with a Tea Party, that's the stuff that could save this country.
[02:01:46.860 --> 02:02:03.964]  Yes, I mean, our computer has actually, does political forecasting, and you can, we've been forecasting, honestly, for the last two decades that 2016 would be the first shot at a third party rising.
[02:02:04.935 --> 02:02:12.058]  And I think that you're going to see, you know, that is kind of turning into like a civil war in the Republican Party.
[02:02:12.078 --> 02:02:14.619]  You have, you know, the Tea Party, etc.
[02:02:14.659 --> 02:02:16.459]  But typically that will split.
[02:02:17.140 --> 02:02:26.623]  And what I would really like to see would be maybe Rand Paul at least head some sort of a third party and get out of the Republicans.
[02:02:27.023 --> 02:02:33.626]  He might not feel that way just yet, but he can't become the party candidate.
[02:02:34.389 --> 02:02:35.670]  Democrat or Republican.
[02:02:35.710 --> 02:02:37.491]  We're not kissing a lot of ass to get there.
[02:02:42.775 --> 02:02:48.078]  I tell you, it just makes me shake my head to see the situation we're in.
[02:02:48.859 --> 02:02:55.463]  What are some of the other predictions that you, with your research, but also with your algorithms, that you think we're going to see unfolding?
[02:02:58.925 --> 02:03:03.969]  Basically, what we've done is we have taken everything and
[02:03:04.542 --> 02:03:06.924]  The computer correlates the entire world.
[02:03:07.104 --> 02:03:14.509]  And when you put it that way and you forget the politics and the bias and the personal views, it's very interesting.
[02:03:14.850 --> 02:03:23.116]  And what you come up with is that you see, as I say, that we don't go to war as long as everybody's fat and happy.
[02:03:24.316 --> 02:03:27.599]  You turn the economy down, that's when you get civil unrest and war.
[02:03:28.379 --> 02:03:31.862]  And what the computer's doing this time is that it retracts
[02:03:32.543 --> 02:03:40.348]  Both civil unrest, which was, you know, will rise to a revolutionary level, and we track international war.
[02:03:40.488 --> 02:03:45.131]  And this particular cycle turned up in both of them in 2014.
[02:03:45.951 --> 02:03:50.554]  And it doesn't peak out on the international war side until about 2017.
[02:03:51.294 --> 02:03:54.977]  But you're starting to see separatist movements everywhere.
[02:03:55.597 --> 02:03:58.879]  I mean, in Europe, it was amazing.
[02:03:58.939 --> 02:04:00.460]  I was just over in Barcelona.
[02:04:01.398 --> 02:04:02.978]  They want to, you know, leave Spain.
[02:04:03.038 --> 02:04:06.299]  Scotland's trying to get away from England.
[02:04:06.899 --> 02:04:08.900]  It's virtually everywhere.
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:16.441]  And this is what is caused by the mismanagement of the economy by governments across the globe.
[02:04:17.241 --> 02:04:30.144]  So, honestly, this is the peak in government and, unfortunately, over the next four years, what you're going to see is government become even more aggressive.
[02:04:30.919 --> 02:04:36.021]  They're not just going to simply lay down their guns and say, oh, okay, fine, sorry, we were wrong.
[02:04:36.981 --> 02:04:40.723]  They will fight and scream until, you know, their last dying breath.
[02:04:40.803 --> 02:04:43.004]  It's going to be like Hitler in the bunker.
[02:04:44.624 --> 02:04:45.265]  Pretty much.
[02:04:45.405 --> 02:04:50.687]  I mean, even if you look at how did Hitler come to power?
[02:04:51.747 --> 02:04:53.348]  Same type of economic crisis.
[02:04:53.408 --> 02:04:55.889]  Martin Armstrong promised he'll come back very soon.
[02:04:57.276 --> 02:04:58.017]  Yes, of course.
[02:04:58.137 --> 02:04:58.698]  It was very good.
[02:04:58.879 --> 02:04:59.640]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:00.781]  ArmstrongEconomics.com.
[02:05:00.821 --> 02:05:02.744]  Folks, you should see your film, The Forecaster.
[02:05:02.985 --> 02:05:03.546]  Thank you so much.
[02:05:03.626 --> 02:05:05.388]  I look forward to speaking to you many times in the future.
[02:05:05.649 --> 02:05:06.270]  Amazing interview.
[02:05:09.525 --> 02:05:17.871]  The secret Bilderberg meeting might not be worthy of news coverage from the corporate media, but it's certainly getting attention from the police, military, and intelligence services.
[02:05:18.051 --> 02:05:21.153]  You've seen our reporters being harassed at checkpoints all week.
[02:05:21.313 --> 02:05:26.096]  Well now, an exclusion zone has been secured around the entire Interalpen hotel grounds.
[02:05:26.236 --> 02:05:29.499]  Trespassers face two weeks imprisonment and a hefty fine.
[02:05:29.659 --> 02:05:34.582]  A 30-mile no-fly zone extends to drones, planes, paragliders, even hang gliders.
[02:05:34.822 --> 02:05:40.086]  The ban also extends to video and audio recordings made within and around the area.
[02:06:04.662 --> 02:06:25.696]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website InfoWars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[02:06:25.937 --> 02:06:29.419]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[02:06:29.779 --> 02:06:33.440]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:35.101]  Hdfirearms.com.
[02:06:35.381 --> 02:06:38.582]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[02:06:38.702 --> 02:06:43.604]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[02:06:43.804 --> 02:06:44.684]  It's always about security.
[02:06:44.704 --> 02:06:45.084]  Thank you.
[02:07:09.128 --> 02:07:10.028]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[02:07:10.088 --> 02:07:10.489]  Good, brother.
[02:07:10.649 --> 02:07:12.329]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:07:12.369 --> 02:07:14.150]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:07:14.330 --> 02:07:18.312]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:07:18.332 --> 02:07:20.933]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:07:20.973 --> 02:07:23.194]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:07:23.394 --> 02:07:31.257]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:07:31.657 --> 02:07:34.681]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[02:07:34.801 --> 02:07:36.303]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:07:36.343 --> 02:07:39.246]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:07:39.386 --> 02:07:40.728]  Saving a ton of money there.
[02:07:41.028 --> 02:07:46.374]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[02:07:46.374 --> 02:07:48.695]  Concentrated or maximum potency.
[02:07:48.875 --> 02:08:00.842]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while But then burn you out in my experience where a stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[02:08:00.882 --> 02:08:07.826]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[02:08:12.293 --> 02:08:18.299]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:21.902]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:23.988 --> 02:08:28.849]  Now there's the TAA and the TPA, Trade Promotion Authority, and other systems.
[02:08:29.849 --> 02:08:32.149]  But the big chunk has been voted down in the House.
[02:08:32.169 --> 02:08:34.550]  It was voted, again a few weeks ago, out of the Senate.
[02:08:34.710 --> 02:08:36.030]  They killed debate on it.
[02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:38.971]  They wouldn't release the subsections, but mounting pressure.
[02:08:39.811 --> 02:08:46.112]  A large portion of Democrats joining Tea Party Republicans, led by Senator Sessions and others, exposing it.
[02:08:47.312 --> 02:08:49.032]  And Rand Paul exposing it.
[02:08:49.892 --> 02:08:51.573]  Ted Cruz, his detriment, supported it.
[02:08:52.053 --> 02:08:53.693]  He went way down, in my view, doing that.
[02:08:57.196 --> 02:08:58.837]  But it has failed in the House.
[02:08:58.877 --> 02:09:00.078]  That is just super news.
[02:09:00.579 --> 02:09:02.660]  Obama-backed trade bill fails in the House.
[02:09:03.101 --> 02:09:08.204]  We have the article from the Washington Post linked up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:09:09.352 --> 02:09:20.258]  And this is a victory for those of us that don't want to live in a dictatorship, because it would pass dictatorial power to a great, great extent to the president.
[02:09:20.278 --> 02:09:21.359]  And that's what the globalists want.
[02:09:22.099 --> 02:09:25.141]  But we have all this Bilderberg news coming out as well.
[02:09:25.181 --> 02:09:31.404]  We're going to speak to John Bowne, our reporter, who's been monitoring the C-SPAN vote, shutting down debate, all of it.
[02:09:31.784 --> 02:09:34.406]  And then for about three minutes, then we're going to go to John Rappaport.
[02:09:35.266 --> 02:09:43.230]  And get into Bilderberg, because he's been focusing in on that intensely, investigative journalist John Rappaport.
[02:09:46.012 --> 02:09:49.174]  It is just such an amazing time to be alive in history right now.
[02:09:49.654 --> 02:09:56.838]  So many good things are happening, so many bad things are happening, but you can see time is running out for the shadow government corporate system.
[02:09:57.618 --> 02:09:59.219]  People are aware, more and more.
[02:09:59.599 --> 02:10:00.940]  Sure, you may have the mass of people,
[02:10:02.563 --> 02:10:07.885]  Watching ESPN all day and sucking their thumbs and, you know, tuning into the Kardashians, the latest sex change.
[02:10:08.505 --> 02:10:20.750]  But the people that work, the people that have families, the people that run businesses, the people that are smart, the vast majority of them aren't on the globalist payroll.
[02:10:21.670 --> 02:10:22.991]  And they don't have a death wish.
[02:10:23.311 --> 02:10:25.012]  They don't want to live in mind control land.
[02:10:25.332 --> 02:10:30.494]  They don't want to live in a version of 1984 meets Alice in Wonderland meets Brave New World.
[02:10:32.088 --> 02:10:38.471]  And they are absolutely getting upset and realizing what's happening.
[02:10:38.791 --> 02:10:43.393]  John Bowne, I tell you, I just got a tear of joy when I saw the House shoot this down.
[02:10:43.853 --> 02:10:53.817]  The problem is, they're going to probably try to implement it by fiat now, like they've done so many other things, but we'll fight that, just like Obama has been blocked by courts on his open borders.
[02:10:54.477 --> 02:10:56.078]  So we're fighting back.
[02:10:56.138 --> 02:10:57.999]  John Bowne, what did you witness?
[02:10:59.304 --> 02:11:01.286]  Well, it's all going on live right now.
[02:11:01.306 --> 02:11:02.627]  Can you hear me okay?
[02:11:02.667 --> 02:11:03.368]  Yes, I can, John.
[02:11:03.988 --> 02:11:04.188]  Good.
[02:11:04.429 --> 02:11:13.997]  Alright, so Pete Sessions, a Republican of Texas, was arguing that Paul Ryan was being deceptive.
[02:11:14.258 --> 02:11:16.920]  Paul Ryan being the House Ways and Means Committee Chairman.
[02:11:18.241 --> 02:11:24.547]  What Pete Sessions wants is a new TPA where no power is granted
[02:11:25.208 --> 02:11:28.849]  To the executive branch, which is what Obama is really pushing for.
[02:11:29.010 --> 02:11:35.912]  Basically to become, and agreed upon within Congress, to become basically a dictator.
[02:11:36.933 --> 02:11:45.216]  And so the TAA, which is the Trade Adjustment Assistance Federal Program, was shot down.
[02:11:46.536 --> 02:11:48.477]  And it was actually a 3 to 1 margin.
[02:11:49.097 --> 02:11:53.319]  But the TPA actually passed, but it's only ceremonial.
[02:11:54.341 --> 02:11:58.043]  It really doesn't mean anything if the other bills don't pass.
[02:11:58.583 --> 02:12:02.625]  It's all unraveling and falling apart, as I said it would.
[02:12:03.345 --> 02:12:09.268]  Because people are becoming way too aware of it, and it's largely because of you, my friend.
[02:12:10.638 --> 02:12:11.378]  Well, no.
[02:12:11.498 --> 02:12:13.379]  It's all of us together.
[02:12:13.399 --> 02:12:17.660]  I think Infowars might have had 5% of the reason out of the 100%.
[02:12:18.261 --> 02:12:19.721]  But it's everybody saying no.
[02:12:19.761 --> 02:12:26.043]  And I think it's the fact there are some good Democrats who get you can't have a bunch of shadowy foreign corporations.
[02:12:28.979 --> 02:12:31.060]  Getting total unbridled power.
[02:12:31.501 --> 02:12:33.942]  So that's where the Democrats still have some sanity.
[02:12:34.283 --> 02:12:36.324]  They're wrong on so many other fronts.
[02:12:36.804 --> 02:12:41.808]  Pelosi at the very end, right before the vote, the TAA actually turned and changed her vote.
[02:12:43.809 --> 02:12:44.169]  Oh really?
[02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:47.691]  When she realized it was going to be shot down, she went ahead and jumped in on the winning side?
[02:12:47.711 --> 02:12:52.415]  Yeah, I think she realized her party was going to probably throw her to the wolves.
[02:12:53.527 --> 02:12:56.348]  Well, I mean, this is the problem with the Republican leadership.
[02:12:56.368 --> 02:13:00.309]  They're a bunch of Rockefeller bluebloods, globalists, who are anti-free market.
[02:13:00.929 --> 02:13:02.909]  But I'm glad to hear Pete Sessions told the truth.
[02:13:02.949 --> 02:13:10.811]  You know, some of his family was involved in state politics, and my late grandfather was like best friends with them and actually knows that family well or knew them well.
[02:13:11.311 --> 02:13:18.313]  It's just, you know, it's good to see Texans, as usual, you know, at the end of the day, not that Pete Sessions is perfect, doing the right thing.
[02:13:18.653 --> 02:13:20.654]  I mean, we're talking about handing over
[02:13:21.474 --> 02:13:23.956]  Look at Boehner, who actually isn't supposed to vote, as Speaker, putting his vote in.
[02:13:23.976 --> 02:13:25.436]  You know, putting the knife in the back of the country.
[02:13:42.489 --> 02:13:46.511]  I mean, it takes a lot to... I mean, this isn't a trade deal, folks.
[02:13:46.551 --> 02:13:52.675]  They're handing America over to a foreign shadowy power under a secret document.
[02:13:52.715 --> 02:13:57.637]  I mean, but it's men in suits, and it's trade deals, and it's paper, and it's boring.
[02:13:57.657 --> 02:14:00.039]  If it was a foreign army, people would be out in the streets.
[02:14:00.139 --> 02:14:00.819]  It's just incredible.
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:03.881]  So, what's this other vote that's going on then?
[02:14:05.235 --> 02:14:08.737]  Uh, this one is, let me... Trade Enforcement and Customs.
[02:14:09.118 --> 02:14:12.460]  Yeah, I'll have a full report on all this, get it all together.
[02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:19.504]  But yeah, Trade Enforcement, enforcing orders, reducing customs, evasion.
[02:14:21.348 --> 02:14:23.089]  I think that one regards the border.
[02:14:23.249 --> 02:14:24.590]  Yeah, this is a separate bill.
[02:14:24.630 --> 02:14:27.312]  So the two sections on the TPP shot down.
[02:14:27.392 --> 02:14:27.972]  Praise God.
[02:14:28.012 --> 02:14:29.153]  This is amazing news.
[02:14:29.693 --> 02:14:33.376]  I'm just double-checking because I can't believe my own eyes and I don't believe the Washington Post.
[02:14:34.216 --> 02:14:35.877]  But I guess occasionally they have to tell the truth.
[02:14:35.957 --> 02:14:38.199]  Obama-backed trade bill fails in the House.
[02:14:38.839 --> 02:14:40.780]  That news just broke in the last 15 minutes, folks.
[02:14:40.860 --> 02:14:41.361]  Praise God.
[02:14:41.681 --> 02:14:42.982]  Thank you so much, John Bell.
[02:14:43.817 --> 02:14:44.117]  Thank you.
[02:15:08.595 --> 02:15:16.021]  Folder here that has some of his articles in it, so I wanted to get him to come on the broadcast to talk about his view of Bilderberg 2015.
[02:15:17.443 --> 02:15:23.147]  Are we kind of reaching an equilibrium point, and I don't mean that in a positive way, where the forces of deception
[02:15:24.008 --> 02:15:34.655]  And mental illness and megalomania are rising, but the forces of enlightenment and freedom are rising, so it's the unstoppable force meets the unmovable object.
[02:15:34.735 --> 02:15:36.417]  I mean, everybody senses it.
[02:15:36.917 --> 02:15:40.740]  Events are racing now towards one of those historic explosions.
[02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:45.643]  People also have a feeling of dread, but a feeling of exultation around the world.
[02:15:46.043 --> 02:15:49.205]  Something big is about to happen, or is it already happening?
[02:15:49.506 --> 02:15:51.167]  John Rappaport, what do you think's going on?
[02:15:52.304 --> 02:15:56.005]  Well, it's already happening, Alex, with this last vote.
[02:15:57.005 --> 02:16:05.468]  And you know, they made a gigantic miscalculation, which was we can ram through a completely secret treaty.
[02:16:06.428 --> 02:16:13.070]  The negotiations themselves will be held in secret, and the contents of the treaty will be secret.
[02:16:13.470 --> 02:16:15.331]  You know, so the whole thing was secret.
[02:16:15.731 --> 02:16:17.992]  And then they classified the information.
[02:16:18.692 --> 02:16:22.334]  What I discovered was, it's, you know, top secret, secret.
[02:16:22.374 --> 02:16:31.918]  It's all that kind of classification stuff that supposedly presents legislators from telling the people what they have read that's in the TPP.
[02:16:32.378 --> 02:16:35.680]  Are we starting to see the fall of this secret cover garbage?
[02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:37.440]  Yeah, I think that's what's happened.
[02:16:37.961 --> 02:16:54.328]  And, you know, because it's so blatant now with the internet and with information everywhere for a very long time now, the whole idea is so heinous that the Congress and the President and 11 other countries are going to sign on to this Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[02:16:54.808 --> 02:16:57.391]  And nobody in those countries is even going to know.
[02:16:57.411 --> 02:16:58.092]  Yeah, nobody.
[02:16:58.132 --> 02:16:59.193]  I mean, not just Americans.
[02:16:59.253 --> 02:17:00.475]  I mean, this is our country.
[02:17:00.715 --> 02:17:02.337]  We get to see it, jackasses.
[02:17:02.677 --> 02:17:04.439]  And then we get three subsections of it.
[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:05.941]  And it's not just a trade deal.
[02:17:06.001 --> 02:17:07.243]  It's a giant power grab.
[02:17:07.683 --> 02:17:08.084]  Of course.
[02:17:08.544 --> 02:17:10.006]  And we still don't really know.
[02:17:10.627 --> 02:17:12.689]  Because even with what's been released,
[02:17:13.810 --> 02:17:14.351]  Uh, leaked.
[02:17:14.431 --> 02:17:18.775]  We're not totally sure that this is the final draft or it's an earlier draft.
[02:17:19.215 --> 02:17:20.636]  I mean, it's complete insanity.
[02:17:20.996 --> 02:17:28.303]  And then, as Sessions pointed out about 10 days ago, when he went into the sealed room,
[02:17:28.923 --> 02:17:48.393]  You know, to read sections of the TPP, he came out and he started talking about this thing called living agreements, which means simply that once this treaty would be ratified, then the powers that be in these 12 nations could change it at will to mean anything they want it to mean in the future.
[02:17:48.673 --> 02:17:49.934]  So this is like a blank check.
[02:17:49.974 --> 02:17:55.417]  It's like saying to the globalists, look, you guys do whatever you want up the road here for as long as you want to do it.
[02:17:55.737 --> 02:17:56.738]  You need more power?
[02:17:56.818 --> 02:17:57.198]  Take it.
[02:17:57.618 --> 02:18:01.459]  You want to have no tariffs on anything, anywhere, at any time?
[02:18:01.599 --> 02:18:01.939]  Fine.
[02:18:02.479 --> 02:18:05.920]  You want to sell pharmaceuticals at skyrocket prices?
[02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:06.401]  That's fine.
[02:18:06.421 --> 02:18:08.721]  Whatever you want to do, you just do it.
[02:18:08.801 --> 02:18:10.742]  You take over the government, we surrender.
[02:18:11.262 --> 02:18:20.525]  So, all of this started to come out, and then still Obama is lying, lying, lying, and saying, you people don't understand what's in the agreement, and all this kind of stuff.
[02:18:21.045 --> 02:18:24.946]  It becomes so obvious, so transparent to people around the world,
[02:18:25.626 --> 02:18:28.609]  That these liars are just trying for a power grab.
[02:18:28.670 --> 02:18:30.111]  So is this jumping the shark?
[02:18:30.131 --> 02:18:42.104]  I mean, because we get down now to the final unveiling of world government, and they go, yeah, it's secret, you can't see anything, and foreign corporations will run everything, and by the way, your kids can't play in their backyard if they're 11, we'll take you to jail.
[02:18:42.925 --> 02:18:49.210]  I mean, it's just, they're turning the country into a supermax prison with a bunch of crooks running around in front of us.
[02:18:49.750 --> 02:18:51.111]  I mean, it's just bizarro world.
[02:18:51.792 --> 02:18:52.453]  I agree with you.
[02:18:52.853 --> 02:18:55.975]  I think we're seeing something epic here, and that word doesn't go far enough.
[02:18:56.716 --> 02:19:05.743]  And I think the bad feelings we've all got is realizing the globalists aren't going to give up power easily, and they're going to pull some major fiasco shenanigans.
[02:19:06.303 --> 02:19:06.763]  You bet.
[02:19:07.203 --> 02:19:13.566]  And plus, this vote today that we were just listening to, that's going to come back.
[02:19:13.987 --> 02:19:16.228]  I mean, you know, this stuff doesn't quit.
[02:19:16.548 --> 02:19:19.709]  It's not like, okay, well, we voted it down, that's the end of it.
[02:19:19.809 --> 02:19:21.370]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:19:21.730 --> 02:19:23.291]  It can come back in other forms.
[02:19:23.791 --> 02:19:24.972]  It can be readjusted.
[02:19:25.332 --> 02:19:27.113]  Congress can be called back into session.
[02:19:27.193 --> 02:19:27.933]  Committees can be called back.
[02:19:27.953 --> 02:19:29.734]  Oh, you can package horse manure a thousand different ways.
[02:19:30.354 --> 02:19:30.874]  Exactly.
[02:19:31.214 --> 02:19:32.955]  So we've got to really watch out for that.
[02:19:33.415 --> 02:19:52.143]  And then the thing that I pointed out in yet another article, which is much more long-term and deep, is the fact that globalism itself is like a snake that's been eating its own tail for a very long time, because globalism puts global government in the hands of megacorporations.
[02:19:52.743 --> 02:20:01.654]  At the same time, these megacorporations are endowed with such powers that they essentially destroy the consumer base of the planet.
[02:20:01.694 --> 02:20:02.635]  Let's explain that.
[02:20:02.655 --> 02:20:03.696]  This is key.
[02:20:04.417 --> 02:20:05.298]  Key what he's saying.
[02:20:05.318 --> 02:20:07.741]  A piercing mind of John Rappaport straight ahead.
[02:20:09.557 --> 02:20:11.257]  It's absolutely heartbreaking.
[02:20:11.537 --> 02:20:21.280]  All over America, people are suffering from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, irregular heartbeat, clogged arteries, and high cholesterol.

[02:22:09.281 --> 02:22:13.604]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[02:22:13.724 --> 02:22:18.468]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[02:22:18.588 --> 02:22:22.451]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease.
[02:22:22.631 --> 02:22:26.054]  And a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[02:22:26.294 --> 02:22:28.835]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.

[02:22:33.417 --> 02:22:36.398]  I've suffered with thoughts of constipation most of my life.
[02:22:36.618 --> 02:22:40.479]  Within a few days of taking One World Whey, I noticed a dramatic change.
[02:22:40.919 --> 02:22:44.620]  Also in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[02:22:44.841 --> 02:22:48.302]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[02:22:48.882 --> 02:22:52.364]  Just in the past week or so, I'm not feeling bad anymore, and the foot pain is gone.
[02:22:52.544 --> 02:22:56.747]  I'm just finishing up a five-pound tuff I ordered and just got off the phone ordering more.
[02:22:56.907 --> 02:22:57.808]  I love your product.

[02:24:02.624 --> 02:24:02.884]  No matter...
[02:24:26.482 --> 02:24:28.103]  John Rappaport, investigative journalist.
[02:24:28.143 --> 02:24:29.544]  NoMoreFakeNews.com is our guest.
[02:24:29.584 --> 02:24:31.665]  I'm Alex Jones of Infowars.com.
[02:24:32.246 --> 02:24:33.467]  And it just hit me during the break.
[02:24:34.107 --> 02:24:41.191]  I was hyperventilating, running around the office high-fiving people, literally hopping up and down just a minute ago.
[02:24:41.211 --> 02:24:44.694]  And I thought, man, you're a goofball.
[02:24:44.714 --> 02:24:46.295]  And I went, no, you're normal.
[02:24:48.126 --> 02:24:51.067]  You've got the history, everything that built this country.
[02:24:51.647 --> 02:24:53.808]  I'm not saying I'm special, but compared to zombies, I am.
[02:24:54.448 --> 02:24:57.989]  I mean, I don't get excited when a team I like wins a game.
[02:24:58.009 --> 02:24:59.390]  I might go, hey, cool, they won.
[02:24:59.790 --> 02:25:00.930]  Because I like sports a little bit.
[02:25:00.970 --> 02:25:01.991]  I mean, I'm not going to lie about that.
[02:25:02.411 --> 02:25:03.091]  I grew up playing them.
[02:25:03.591 --> 02:25:08.673]  But man, when we defeat an evil, horrible takeover, I know the enemy's coming back at us.
[02:25:08.733 --> 02:25:11.054]  But still, it's just, it's exciting.
[02:25:12.363 --> 02:25:21.136]  And the fact that it's weird that I start hyperventilating and stuttering and interrupting a guest on air, that's normal, folks.
[02:25:21.917 --> 02:25:23.699]  This is our country being conquered.
[02:25:24.601 --> 02:25:28.686]  I mean, this is real, by really bad people.
[02:25:30.569 --> 02:25:33.510]  And they've already got us in their grasp, but we're trying to struggle out.
[02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:38.872]  And the fact that we're struggling... Listen, they brought the EU in 50-something years ago by stealth.
[02:25:39.533 --> 02:25:42.434]  England didn't get a vote in the 80s, late 80s, was brought into it.
[02:25:43.054 --> 02:25:44.995]  They're now getting ready to try to vote and get out of it.
[02:25:45.535 --> 02:25:49.497]  The point is, they didn't even know they'd gone under the EU until it was announced.
[02:25:50.577 --> 02:25:54.218]  Almost all their laws are made by the unelected EU bureaucracy.
[02:25:55.399 --> 02:25:57.800]  Now they're trying to do the same thing here, and it's failing.
[02:25:59.042 --> 02:26:03.463]  You see, we've gone so far in the fight, folks, that they admit Bilderberg exists.
[02:26:03.503 --> 02:26:04.824]  They admit all this is happening.
[02:26:05.904 --> 02:26:07.565]  Their house of cards is coming down.
[02:26:07.605 --> 02:26:09.465]  We have reached an ultra-epic point.
[02:26:10.406 --> 02:26:11.566]  And I'm not overusing that word.
[02:26:11.606 --> 02:26:12.266]  It's legendary.
[02:26:12.706 --> 02:26:15.807]  The problem is, they're gonna strike back.
[02:26:16.587 --> 02:26:17.908]  And it's gonna be bad.
[02:26:18.508 --> 02:26:19.748]  John Rappaport, this is a short segment.
[02:26:19.988 --> 02:26:20.869]  Long segment's coming up.
[02:26:20.889 --> 02:26:21.989]  You'll have more time to elaborate.
[02:26:22.009 --> 02:26:23.730]  But I don't think I'm overstating things.
[02:26:23.750 --> 02:26:27.951]  And I think it's the fact that people have to get out of their trance, literal trance, that you write about.
[02:26:29.096 --> 02:26:30.477]  And we have to break people out of it.
[02:26:30.517 --> 02:26:32.758]  It's not going to be pretty, like when I was on Piers Morgan.
[02:26:33.198 --> 02:26:37.680]  But it was international sensation, as you wrote, because it was the curtain getting pulled back.
[02:26:38.681 --> 02:26:39.461]  I'm nothing special.
[02:26:39.561 --> 02:26:40.261]  I'm like Toto.
[02:26:40.622 --> 02:26:44.764]  We are all launching Operation Toto, and we're seeing history right now.
[02:26:45.244 --> 02:26:47.665]  I mean, are you getting chills right now?
[02:26:48.466 --> 02:26:54.869]  Yeah, I am, because the legislators are being forced into this by the people, because
[02:26:55.848 --> 02:26:58.249]  You know, they sense this giant wave building.
[02:26:58.549 --> 02:27:00.170]  We're not going to stand for secrecy.
[02:27:00.250 --> 02:27:08.333]  We don't want some supernatural or national government taking over the United States with secret details that we can't even know about.
[02:27:08.933 --> 02:27:16.856]  They're afraid if they just, you know, rubber stamp this whole thing, that it's going to be an enduring nightmare for them.
[02:27:17.256 --> 02:27:19.057]  And so they're backing away right now.
[02:27:19.397 --> 02:27:19.857]  Right now.
[02:27:20.077 --> 02:27:20.897]  They're backing away.
[02:27:20.937 --> 02:27:21.598]  They're saying no.
[02:27:22.598 --> 02:27:23.999]  And that is tremendous.
[02:27:24.540 --> 02:27:29.423]  That is a tremendous defeat for Obama because he's in a sweat and a panic, believe me.
[02:27:29.803 --> 02:27:36.267]  He's running around, making deals, doing everything under the sun possible to get the votes that he wants.
[02:27:36.287 --> 02:27:38.249]  They burned Hastert to scare everybody?
[02:27:39.229 --> 02:27:43.014]  Because if Obama, because Obama was put there to do this.
[02:27:43.515 --> 02:27:45.377]  That's why he's the president.
[02:27:45.838 --> 02:27:46.959]  Forget all the other stuff.
[02:27:47.380 --> 02:27:48.582]  This was his mandate.
[02:27:48.962 --> 02:27:53.188]  There's going to be big time trade treaties coming up and you're going to make... You're right!
[02:27:53.248 --> 02:27:55.271]  He didn't go down to Capitol Hill to push Obamacare.
[02:27:55.511 --> 02:27:56.492]  He went down here on this.
[02:27:57.213 --> 02:27:57.713]  Exactly.
[02:27:58.133 --> 02:28:08.156]  He was mentored by Brzezinski, you know, the intellectual flunky of David Rockefeller, after he won the election in 2008, and he was clued in on all of this.
[02:28:08.616 --> 02:28:13.337]  This is why you're here, Mr. President, to get these trade treaties done.
[02:28:13.877 --> 02:28:15.397]  Failure is not an option.
[02:28:15.697 --> 02:28:16.657]  This is what we want.
[02:28:16.717 --> 02:28:20.998]  You do whatever else you want, but this, this is why you're here.
[02:28:21.399 --> 02:28:22.619]  If you mess this up,
[02:28:23.479 --> 02:28:25.560]  That's a very, very bad thing.
[02:28:26.100 --> 02:28:26.900]  He knows that.
[02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:31.762]  And he is sweating, he's in a panic, and he's trying to get arm twisted.
[02:28:31.822 --> 02:28:36.824]  By the way, the media's pointed out that he's been stuttering more, falling apart, doesn't want to give speeches.
[02:28:37.084 --> 02:28:38.004]  He looks freaked out.
[02:28:38.404 --> 02:28:39.325]  He is freaked out.
[02:28:39.425 --> 02:28:42.706]  He knows who's, you know, he knows who the bosses are.
[02:28:43.266 --> 02:28:51.375]  You know, it's like when you work for a company and the boss comes down and he says, look, this is the project that's going to pull us out or keep us in front.
[02:28:51.795 --> 02:28:53.216]  And you've got to make it happen.
[02:28:53.297 --> 02:28:54.378]  I don't want any excuses.
[02:28:54.438 --> 02:28:56.680]  I don't want to hear anything about failure.
[02:28:57.080 --> 02:28:59.083]  Whatever you have to do, you make it work.
[02:28:59.503 --> 02:29:03.207]  Remember that this is the next eight or 10 years of what we're doing here.
[02:29:03.647 --> 02:29:08.292]  Well, the boss goes back upstairs and the guy's in this, well, okay, well, I'll do this, no question about it.
[02:29:08.593 --> 02:29:11.856]  But then when push comes to shove, it turns out it's not easy.
[02:29:12.156 --> 02:29:13.338]  It turns out it's a struggle.
[02:29:13.398 --> 02:29:17.202]  It turns out that, you know, what is Obama trying to promote?
[02:29:17.322 --> 02:29:19.244]  He's trying to promote utter secrecy.
[02:29:19.344 --> 02:29:20.465]  Just do what I tell you to do.
[02:29:20.485 --> 02:29:22.427]  It turns out there's people that know the game plan.
[02:29:22.467 --> 02:29:25.551]  It turns out there's a resistance that was waiting, that knew this was coming.
[02:29:25.951 --> 02:29:26.472]  Exactly.
[02:29:26.752 --> 02:29:27.774]  And now here we go.
[02:29:28.154 --> 02:29:29.596]  Now here we go.
[02:29:30.017 --> 02:29:30.458]  That's right.
[02:29:30.498 --> 02:29:33.782]  We've been patriots for 60 years have been building to fight you.
[02:29:34.644 --> 02:29:40.432]  We stand on the bones of millions of people that knew more than we did when nobody was listening to them.
[02:29:40.452 --> 02:29:41.593]  And it's because of those people.
[02:29:42.611 --> 02:29:47.273]  It's because of those people, folks, we're now where we're at in a fighting stance against the globalists.
[02:29:47.954 --> 02:29:49.114]  And that's what I'm trying to tell people.
[02:29:49.174 --> 02:29:51.775]  As bad as the zombie population is, they're out of the game.
[02:29:51.815 --> 02:29:52.376]  They don't count.
[02:29:52.616 --> 02:29:57.438]  There are giant sectors of people that know the whole nine yards, and we're ready.
[02:29:58.939 --> 02:29:59.839]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.339 --> 02:30:01.940]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.861 --> 02:30:05.562]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.634 --> 02:30:15.436]  Once again, I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com on this June 12th of 2015, bringing you the hot topics of the day.
[02:30:15.636 --> 02:30:18.797]  American teenager pleads guilty to helping Islamic State.
[02:30:19.077 --> 02:30:26.599]  Article up by Reuters, a 17-year-old from Virginia pleaded guilty in court on Thursday to charges of conspiring to help Islamic State militants.
[02:30:26.779 --> 02:30:31.140]  The first time the United States has prosecuted a minor as an adult in such a case.
[02:30:31.440 --> 02:30:40.868]  Ali Ahmed of Manassas, Virginia used Twitter and his blog to provide instructions on how to use the virtual currency Bitcoin to send funds to the militants according to court documents.
[02:30:41.148 --> 02:30:45.472]  The world's first penis transplant has reportedly resulted in a pregnancy.
[02:30:45.592 --> 02:30:50.216]  Article at the Washington Post, the recipient of the world's first successful penis transplant
[02:30:50.356 --> 02:30:51.237]  We'll soon be a father.
[02:30:51.457 --> 02:30:57.201]  According to the South African outlet News 24, his surgeons were recently informed that his girlfriend is pregnant.
[02:30:57.281 --> 02:31:05.687]  The surgery took place just six months ago, three years after the 21-year-old had lost his own penis after infection caused by a botched ceremonial circumcision.
[02:31:05.747 --> 02:31:09.009]  You can find more articles like this at Infowars.com.

[02:31:39.267 --> 02:31:42.489]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:42.789 --> 02:31:50.793]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:51.033 --> 02:31:56.055]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:33:05.041 --> 02:33:06.262]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:30.143 --> 02:33:58.607]  Bad luck wind been blowin' at my back I was born to bring trouble to wherever I'm at Got the number 13 tattooed on my neck When the ink starts to itch then the black will turn to red
[02:34:00.882 --> 02:34:01.803]  We are back live.
[02:34:03.464 --> 02:34:09.009]  The PPP, TPP, Trans-Pacific Takeover.
[02:34:10.571 --> 02:34:13.293]  The Global Government Treaty has been shot down in the house.
[02:34:13.593 --> 02:34:15.155]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[02:34:16.069 --> 02:34:20.212]  They will try to repackage, they will try to bring it back, but it is a devastating victory.
[02:34:20.692 --> 02:34:21.873]  John Rappaport's our guest.
[02:34:21.893 --> 02:34:39.466]  I wanted to get Leon McAdoo in here to talk about the culture war, though, the weaponization of the media, this Bruce Jenner garbage, trying to finance a race war, using the globalist training of the police that is atrocious to then create a culture clash there.
[02:34:39.827 --> 02:34:43.149]  How Mr. Rappaport thinks we navigate out of that.
[02:34:43.269 --> 02:34:45.331]  Briefly, because I didn't do any plugging last hour,
[02:34:46.482 --> 02:34:51.625]  We finance our operation here, selling super high quality products.
[02:34:52.486 --> 02:34:56.468]  And I believe in one thing at my core, and that's win-win.
[02:34:57.069 --> 02:35:00.391]  I don't do something to someone unless it's how I want to be treated.
[02:35:01.051 --> 02:35:03.293]  Now you come over and knock me upside the head, I'm going to attack you.
[02:35:03.773 --> 02:35:06.535]  But I like having people over for dinner.
[02:35:06.615 --> 02:35:07.576]  I like making people dinner.
[02:35:08.056 --> 02:35:09.877]  I like successful people.
[02:35:10.297 --> 02:35:12.159]  I don't get mad when other people are doing well.
[02:35:12.719 --> 02:35:14.020]  I'm a nice guy.
[02:35:15.270 --> 02:35:16.931]  I'm not up here saying I'm some great person.
[02:35:16.971 --> 02:35:20.253]  My point is, is that I grew up thinking everybody was like me or my family.
[02:35:20.673 --> 02:35:23.154]  No, a lot of folks are losers and they hate winners.
[02:35:23.735 --> 02:35:27.757]  Or they're quasi-winners, but they're still haters and they don't like other winners.
[02:35:28.397 --> 02:35:29.698]  And the globalists are that.
[02:35:30.458 --> 02:35:43.005]  So anything we sell, anything we promote, whether it's the non-GMO, heirloom, organic, high-quality seeds, or the water filtration systems, or the books, the films, the Patriot apparel, the nutraceuticals at Infowarslife.com,
[02:35:44.527 --> 02:35:51.343]  Is the very best thing that I can come up with that I personally use, that I personally want.
[02:35:53.322 --> 02:36:10.089]  Whether it's, you know, Head Down Firearms, HDFirearms.com, or whether it's InfoWarsHealth.com, and the Young Jevy line of products there, you can get discounted, and get free shipping when you sign up for auto-ship, and a 30% discount the first time you order, when you sign up to be a distributor.
[02:36:10.369 --> 02:36:15.071]  I mean, there's those type of deals at InfoWarsHealth.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:36:16.553 --> 02:36:17.814]  And that's how we fund ourselves.
[02:36:17.834 --> 02:36:19.536]  You see me skipping two, three breaks today.
[02:36:19.576 --> 02:36:20.717]  You see me not even plugging.
[02:36:21.117 --> 02:36:23.880]  Almost all of the radio hosts plug every segment.
[02:36:24.641 --> 02:36:26.403]  And radio can't even stay afloat doing that.
[02:36:26.843 --> 02:36:29.386]  Our audience is so huge, I can get away with this.
[02:36:30.066 --> 02:36:33.830]  But then I forget and don't, and we run out of money to send reporters to Bilderberg or wherever.
[02:36:34.951 --> 02:36:36.052]  We have a lot of enemies, too.
[02:36:36.112 --> 02:36:38.835]  We need to have a war chest, not just enough money to operate.
[02:36:39.798 --> 02:36:46.428]  So, you know this, when you buy the products at Infowarslife.com or Infowarsstore.com, or when you call and order, or when you write to us and order...
[02:36:47.782 --> 02:36:51.944]  You are funding people that are committed to not selling out.
[02:36:52.585 --> 02:36:53.785]  Committed to telling the truth.
[02:36:54.466 --> 02:36:56.507]  Folks, I couldn't be made to sell out under torture.
[02:36:57.207 --> 02:36:58.568]  I cannot physically do it.
[02:36:59.249 --> 02:37:00.890]  They can even come after my kids and they know this.
[02:37:01.170 --> 02:37:02.811]  I just cannot do this.
[02:37:03.291 --> 02:37:05.012]  And they're going to run into that across the country.
[02:37:05.032 --> 02:37:07.133]  People that have halfway sold out, didn't know they had.
[02:37:07.653 --> 02:37:10.015]  When it comes and gets very clear, they're going to say no.
[02:37:11.616 --> 02:37:13.618]  Because what's valuable is not being slaves.
[02:37:13.658 --> 02:37:15.200]  What's valuable is having integrity.
[02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:21.246]  But they're going to use racism and infighting and trolls on all sides to try to get us at each other's throats.
[02:37:21.767 --> 02:37:22.888]  It must fail.
[02:37:23.488 --> 02:37:27.453]  We must be unified by a culture of liberty and freedom and ideals.
[02:37:27.913 --> 02:37:34.635]  So, InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsHealth.com, the whole Young Jevy line, discounted, high quality.
[02:37:35.036 --> 02:37:38.877]  And your purchase of the products funds the operation, and it's a win-win.
[02:37:38.897 --> 02:37:47.100]  You get great products at the lowest prices you're going to find on those items, sometimes even lower than we're really supposed to have things for sale in agreements.
[02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:50.961]  Because sometimes we're doing one special, and then we do another special not thinking.
[02:37:51.181 --> 02:37:51.922]  We don't do it on purpose.
[02:37:52.901 --> 02:37:54.062]  But we're that competitive.
[02:37:54.242 --> 02:37:55.462]  We're that capitalistic.
[02:37:55.642 --> 02:37:56.783]  We're that Americana.
[02:37:56.983 --> 02:37:58.124]  We're what's left of it.
[02:37:58.804 --> 02:37:59.945]  Not what's old-fashioned.
[02:38:00.205 --> 02:38:04.147]  The ideas of America were never fully realized, but they were the most revolutionary ever.
[02:38:04.507 --> 02:38:12.171]  America had tons of evil in it, but the idea of private property, the idea of being left alone, even though it was never fully realized, was
[02:38:13.427 --> 02:38:16.948]  Like Kryptonite to Superman, but not a good Superman, a bad Superman.
[02:38:17.429 --> 02:38:20.670]  It is anathema to the enemy, so thank you all for your support.
[02:38:20.750 --> 02:38:23.551]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[02:38:24.491 --> 02:38:26.372]  The other big link is not just supporting us.
[02:38:26.532 --> 02:38:33.195]  It is just as important to become a sponsor of local stations, or support local sponsors of stations, and to spread the word about local stations.
[02:38:33.575 --> 02:38:35.215]  So thank you so much for doing that as well.
[02:38:35.515 --> 02:38:36.896]  That is essential.
[02:38:37.636 --> 02:38:38.477]  You're sick of tyranny?
[02:38:39.177 --> 02:38:41.018]  Go get a billboard for the local station we're on.
[02:38:41.078 --> 02:38:41.558]  Pay for it.
[02:38:41.578 --> 02:38:41.958]  Put it up.
[02:38:43.561 --> 02:38:47.303]  Probably cost a thousand dollars to reach tens of thousands of people.
[02:38:48.623 --> 02:38:49.684]  Wake up thousands of people.
[02:38:50.544 --> 02:38:51.605]  Or you got a local business?
[02:38:52.265 --> 02:38:53.285]  Go sponsor the show!
[02:38:53.666 --> 02:38:56.847]  I mean, it's time to put the money where the mouth is, folks.
[02:38:57.207 --> 02:38:58.728]  It's time to commit, okay?
[02:38:59.048 --> 02:39:01.309]  I'm not bragging, but I've been through all sorts of hell.
[02:39:01.909 --> 02:39:02.570]  Okay, and you know what?
[02:39:02.610 --> 02:39:03.590]  It's only made me better.
[02:39:03.850 --> 02:39:04.670]  It's made me stronger.
[02:39:04.971 --> 02:39:09.633]  And now since so many people already went before us and trailblazed in the enemy's face,
[02:39:10.532 --> 02:39:12.833]  You don't get the heat you used to get doing low-level stuff.
[02:39:13.113 --> 02:39:14.694]  The enemy is in trouble, folks.
[02:39:15.674 --> 02:39:17.295]  The enemy wanted to intimidate us.
[02:39:17.655 --> 02:39:19.216]  They took our laziness as weakness.
[02:39:19.476 --> 02:39:20.517]  That is not what it was.
[02:39:20.577 --> 02:39:22.538]  So let's take action now.
[02:39:22.838 --> 02:39:23.798]  Thank you for your support.
[02:39:24.158 --> 02:39:37.645]  And then we also support and magnify all the other amazing minds and patriots, whether it's Ron Paul or John Rappaport or Paul Watson or Jakari Jackson or Leanne McAdoo and just all the rest, our great writers, all the people, you the listeners.
[02:39:38.587 --> 02:39:41.989]  It's legendary, it's the fight, it's the defense against the globalist.
[02:39:42.550 --> 02:39:45.932]  Even if we lose, at least we didn't crawl around on the ground, we stood up.
[02:39:46.672 --> 02:39:50.915]  And it's that animating contest that Jefferson wrote about that makes us who we are.
[02:39:51.455 --> 02:39:57.479]  It's that struggle that builds our spiritual muscles, our physical muscles, our intestinal fortitude.
[02:39:58.159 --> 02:39:59.020]  It's addicting!
[02:40:00.219 --> 02:40:06.841]  I mean, I've gone from being afraid 20 years ago, to not being afraid, to just being beyond that.
[02:40:06.881 --> 02:40:08.981]  Just almost wanting them to come.
[02:40:09.201 --> 02:40:11.002]  Not even, just ready for battle!
[02:40:11.302 --> 02:40:12.102]  Ready for it all!
[02:40:12.242 --> 02:40:13.163]  Ready for the test!
[02:40:13.523 --> 02:40:13.943]  Ready!
[02:40:16.223 --> 02:40:24.706]  Alright, I want to give John Rappaport five, six minutes to have the floor on this subject without me interrupting, then I'm going to have Leon McAdoo's check going in with the culture war, and get John Rappaport's take on that.
[02:40:24.746 --> 02:40:25.266]  John Rappaport.
[02:40:26.454 --> 02:40:27.655]  Okay, a couple things Alex.
[02:40:28.376 --> 02:40:33.661]  One is, there's still some people out there who under the incredible delusion
[02:40:35.009 --> 02:40:40.272]  That the benevolent government is going to be the one to rescue us from globalism.
[02:40:40.812 --> 02:40:49.357]  When in fact, it's the government collaboration with megacorporations and megamoney and megabanksters that is what globalism is.
[02:40:49.537 --> 02:40:51.899]  Not just the US government, but many governments.
[02:40:51.919 --> 02:40:52.779]  The snake eating itself.
[02:40:52.819 --> 02:40:53.299]  Get into that.
[02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:54.280]  Exactly.
[02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:55.721]  The snake eating itself.
[02:40:56.121 --> 02:40:57.542]  That is the fact.
[02:40:58.602 --> 02:41:02.625]  That the globalism paradigm has megacorporations
[02:41:03.809 --> 02:41:17.052]  With such license to roam and destroy and plunder and kill markets and kill competitors and small businesses and so forth, that the gap between the very rich and the very poor is growing.
[02:41:17.132 --> 02:41:18.592]  It's getting wider and wider.
[02:41:18.632 --> 02:41:20.292]  And therefore, what does that mean?
[02:41:20.372 --> 02:41:28.654]  That means that the global consumer base is shrinking for people who can buy the products that these megacorporations are making.
[02:41:29.254 --> 02:41:32.395]  That's the crash up ahead in the road that's right there.
[02:41:33.015 --> 02:41:38.998]  That's what some of the people at Bilderberg behind the scenes are actually talking about, because they can see it coming.
[02:41:39.378 --> 02:41:40.018]  Wait a minute!
[02:41:40.178 --> 02:41:41.819]  We made a miscalculation!
[02:41:42.499 --> 02:41:55.205]  We figured that these megacorporations, which are the best organizations in the world to plunder foreign lands, slave labor, mineral resources, and so on and so forth, this would be the way that we take over the world.
[02:41:55.605 --> 02:41:56.606]  But who knew?
[02:41:57.714 --> 02:42:01.715]  They're shrinking the consumer base of people who can buy the products.
[02:42:02.175 --> 02:42:06.176]  These megacorporations are operating their assembly lines at half power.
[02:42:06.576 --> 02:42:10.136]  They could produce enough for two or three planets the size of Earth.
[02:42:10.516 --> 02:42:25.539]  And meanwhile, the 10% roughly of the world's population that actually can participate as consumers and buy the products that these megacorporations make, that's even shrinking further and further and further.
[02:42:26.039 --> 02:42:28.641]  That means crack up, smash up.
[02:42:29.101 --> 02:42:31.563]  The whole thing is going into failure.
[02:42:32.083 --> 02:42:36.546]  The lights are blinking, the flags, the red flags are rising.
[02:42:36.886 --> 02:42:38.547]  This is not going to work.
[02:42:39.167 --> 02:42:41.129]  That's the snake eating its own tail.
[02:42:41.489 --> 02:42:43.310]  That's what's happening to globalism.
[02:42:43.830 --> 02:42:44.711]  It doesn't work.
[02:42:44.851 --> 02:42:45.871]  It could never work.
[02:42:45.992 --> 02:42:52.856]  And now some of the people are facing, who are the globalists, are facing up to what's about to hit them.
[02:42:53.236 --> 02:43:04.323]  Which is why the decentralization of power along every possible front is what we have to stand for and do because this whole superstructure is going to fail.
[02:43:05.303 --> 02:43:11.727]  What do you make of the record over-the-top beyond security that Hitler and Austria would have?
[02:43:11.787 --> 02:43:17.070]  I mean, seriously, just bizarro level security at Bilderberg.
[02:43:17.090 --> 02:43:18.790]  Does that reflect their panic mode?
[02:43:19.351 --> 02:43:25.474]  I think it does, absolutely, because they're just, you know, casting about in a panic for solutions.
[02:43:25.574 --> 02:43:26.395]  What are we going to do?
[02:43:27.255 --> 02:43:29.036]  I mean, we've got another problem here, which
[02:43:29.056 --> 02:43:31.577]  Which is robots, machines.
[02:43:31.937 --> 02:43:35.059]  The automation of industry is coming on like crazy.
[02:43:35.099 --> 02:43:41.162]  The technocrats are inventing new ways to structure assembly lines of any kind.
[02:43:41.482 --> 02:43:47.265]  That's going to put more people out of work who can't afford to buy the products of these megacorporations.
[02:43:47.665 --> 02:43:48.586]  What are we going to do?
[02:43:49.066 --> 02:44:03.294]  Are we going to wire the brains of everybody in the world to put them into a deep hypnotic trance and virtual reality like DARPA is trying to do so they think they're seeing one thing in front of their nose when it's really something else.
[02:44:03.634 --> 02:44:11.298]  I mean they're just going into panic mode because they see the handwriting on the wall and they don't want to see anybody
[02:44:11.578 --> 02:44:11.738]  Sure.
[02:44:11.758 --> 02:44:14.560]  I want to bring Leanne McAdoo in, but let's accelerate past that.
[02:44:14.660 --> 02:44:18.963]  You're right, they told the corporations and the college PhDs and the level above the capstone
[02:44:32.969 --> 02:44:40.831]  The level right below the capstone, we know that they told him globalism was for good and then now it's anti-human, it's imploding things.
[02:44:41.272 --> 02:44:49.534]  When you get into higher level writings, as you know, they admit they want a zero growth or negative growth human population, global crash, they control.
[02:44:50.796 --> 02:45:00.964]  That they use then as the global authority to be the saviors to come in with peacekeeping forces and succeed where Hitler, who carried out their first eugenics program, failed.
[02:45:01.464 --> 02:45:03.386]  And again, I'm not saying it's a Nazi conspiracy, folks.
[02:45:03.446 --> 02:45:07.349]  I'm saying he was one model or a beta test and that's all declassified.
[02:45:07.909 --> 02:45:10.652]  And so there is even a plan within this
[02:45:11.983 --> 02:45:21.728]  You can call it psychopaths rationalizing a system that's imploding, but Club of Rome in the 60s envisioned and basically laid all of this out and it's been adopted.
[02:45:21.788 --> 02:45:30.453]  So what do you say to that method, to the madness and the deception of the acolytes of globalism who believed that they were going to usher in a utopia?
[02:45:30.813 --> 02:45:34.535]  Well, this is a utopia for devilish minds, for psychopaths.
[02:45:34.915 --> 02:45:38.317]  It is a utopia for those that want to live in a bloody charnel house.
[02:45:39.857 --> 02:45:40.458]  Yeah, it is.
[02:45:41.533 --> 02:46:01.381]  But with all of that preparation and planning and zero growth and depopulation and what have you, the problem remains because these mega corporations, the Monsantos of the world and so on, have been told, listen, you are our boys.
[02:46:02.002 --> 02:46:04.903]  You're carrying the freight for globalism around the world.
[02:46:05.303 --> 02:46:07.564]  That's why we're giving you this incredibly
[02:46:08.625 --> 02:46:12.329]  Privileged treatment to do anything you want to to anybody at any time.
[02:46:12.710 --> 02:46:25.905]  This is why we put armies at your beck and call and intelligence agencies to go into foreign lands and prepare the way for you to take over the resources and the people and so on and you're our boys and wait a minute though.
[02:46:26.545 --> 02:46:27.186]  Wait a minute.
[02:46:27.526 --> 02:46:39.333]  How are the megacorporations going to profit and flourish with zero growth, depopulation, shrinking radically the consumer base?
[02:46:39.353 --> 02:46:39.773]  Exactly.
[02:46:39.833 --> 02:46:42.755]  The minions are getting the fact that they were set up.
[02:46:42.975 --> 02:46:43.876]  They were set up.
[02:46:43.996 --> 02:46:44.636]  Exactly.
[02:46:44.856 --> 02:46:46.017]  They were set up.
[02:46:47.284 --> 02:46:54.926]  We gotta have you back for like a two, three hour break down the whole state of the world with you, because you really, really can crystallize it just in an amazing way.
[02:46:55.446 --> 02:47:11.189]  Leanne McAdoo is here and she's got a really just microcosm story that illustrates the insanity of all this, where they make it all about race, all about identity, which is the opposite of what Martin Luther King taught, and I want to get your take on this after the break, or right before the break.
[02:47:11.529 --> 02:47:11.889]  Leanne?
[02:47:13.148 --> 02:47:15.950]  Well, there's a new trans debate going on right now.
[02:47:16.050 --> 02:47:25.597]  So for the last month, pretty hardcore, it's kind of been shoved down our throat that we need to accept people and the way that they self-identify, right?
[02:47:25.617 --> 02:47:27.098]  With this whole transgender movement.
[02:47:27.558 --> 02:47:29.480]  And just even questioning it means you hate them.
[02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:30.621]  No, we don't hate anybody.
[02:47:30.701 --> 02:47:32.422]  Why is this the number one issue in the world?
[02:47:32.702 --> 02:47:32.882]  Right.
[02:47:33.603 --> 02:47:40.288]  Well, now it's kind of thrown back in their face a little bit because it turns out there was the leader of
[02:47:41.711 --> 02:47:50.476]  An NAACP chapter in Spokane, Washington is a white woman who was masquerading as a black woman for at least the last 10 years.
[02:47:50.556 --> 02:47:52.157]  And her parents aren't black.
[02:47:52.277 --> 02:47:53.038]  They've gone public.
[02:47:53.378 --> 02:47:54.058]  Tell us about this.
[02:47:54.479 --> 02:47:57.660]  But now they're saying she'd have the right to say she's black.
[02:47:58.001 --> 02:47:58.181]  Right.
[02:47:58.877 --> 02:48:05.260]  And so, Biggs had a really crude analogy that he wanted to be a body part of Brad Pitt.
[02:48:06.020 --> 02:48:10.081]  I mean, I guess I could say I'm a toad then, or I could say I'm an eagle.
[02:48:10.522 --> 02:48:15.844]  I self-identify as a billionaire, so I need you to... So I have to give you that credit of a billionaire?
[02:48:16.044 --> 02:48:16.224]  Yes.
[02:48:17.682 --> 02:48:18.222]  Absolutely.
[02:48:18.923 --> 02:48:21.305]  Well, so, I mean, this lady took it to the next level.
[02:48:21.725 --> 02:48:25.048]  She's the president of the NAACP.
[02:48:25.528 --> 02:48:29.071]  She got her master's degree from Howard.
[02:48:30.191 --> 02:48:31.192]  University, is that what I'm saying?
[02:48:31.212 --> 02:48:32.312]  Yeah, black university.
[02:48:32.352 --> 02:48:37.836]  So she's a con, she's a con, she's a con, but it's okay because she has an identity.
[02:48:37.896 --> 02:48:39.657]  I don't think she is even a con.
[02:48:39.717 --> 02:48:40.998]  She is delusional.
[02:48:41.338 --> 02:48:43.879]  She assimilated herself into this black culture.
[02:48:43.940 --> 02:48:55.747]  Her family, they were missionaries in South Africa before she was born, but they adopted some black children and one child from Haiti, another, you know, three African-American children.
[02:48:55.767 --> 02:48:56.928]  So we need to accept her as black.
[02:48:57.028 --> 02:48:57.208]  Right.
[02:48:57.848 --> 02:49:00.769]  And if you don't, then you are trans-racist.
[02:49:01.210 --> 02:49:02.790]  And we probably should go get you some counseling.
[02:49:03.971 --> 02:49:06.792]  If you don't believe that she's a black woman, because that's how she is.
[02:49:06.812 --> 02:49:14.195]  So John Robport, they take our real rights, all of our rights collectively, to not be spied on, to not have our money devalued, to not have poison put in our food.
[02:49:14.215 --> 02:49:19.238]  But then they give us all these faux rights, because the globalists don't care if we wear dresses.
[02:49:19.458 --> 02:49:21.739]  I mean, isn't it really just a political football?
[02:49:22.523 --> 02:49:23.524]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:49:23.544 --> 02:49:30.731]  I mean, it's a sensational story that keeps people glued because, you know, it's appealing to lowest common denominator.
[02:49:31.111 --> 02:49:33.494]  It's like yet another celebrity story.
[02:49:33.554 --> 02:49:34.655]  I mean, it's on that level.
[02:49:35.135 --> 02:49:37.798]  So, oh wow, we now have a new whole thing here.
[02:49:37.898 --> 02:49:40.681]  I can say that I'm a table or telephone.
[02:49:41.381 --> 02:49:43.682]  And, you know, what rights does the table have?
[02:49:43.702 --> 02:49:50.844]  Well, let's get together and form a group and, you know, the table people and get some legislation passed and whatever and what have you, you know.
[02:49:51.204 --> 02:49:55.265]  So what's going to happen if a hundred black people decide they want to be white?
[02:49:56.065 --> 02:50:01.146]  You know, and there's something we can argue about for the next... Sounds like a Dave Chabelle skit when he goes and joins the Klan.
[02:50:02.027 --> 02:50:02.647]  Exactly.
[02:50:02.667 --> 02:50:05.688]  People on Twitter are saying, well, I self-identify as white.
[02:50:05.728 --> 02:50:06.688]  I'm going to go get a home loan.
[02:50:09.449 --> 02:50:12.190]  That, by the way, is why they had to get rid of Dave Chappelle.
[02:50:12.711 --> 02:50:14.692]  Because he was cutting too close to the bone.
[02:50:14.712 --> 02:50:18.954]  I mean, he was showing all of these insanities that, you know, we're talking about now.
[02:50:18.974 --> 02:50:20.235]  These cultural insanities.
[02:50:21.575 --> 02:50:22.976]  Yeah, I liked him before.
[02:50:22.996 --> 02:50:24.117]  I thought he was really smart.
[02:50:24.157 --> 02:50:29.320]  I went and saw him live in Austin and he just seemed... He gained like 80 pounds.
[02:50:29.460 --> 02:50:29.940]  He wasn't fat.
[02:50:29.960 --> 02:50:32.902]  He looked like he was like an NFL linebacker.
[02:50:33.162 --> 02:50:36.223]  But he just seemed totally... It wasn't the same Dave Chappelle.
[02:50:36.744 --> 02:50:36.884]  No.
[02:50:37.688 --> 02:50:38.308]  Definitely not.
[02:50:49.753 --> 02:50:50.434]  We'll be right back.

[02:51:42.793 --> 02:51:43.333]  It's true.
[02:51:43.633 --> 02:51:47.514]  That's why for quality storable foods, you need Ready Made Resources.

[02:52:03.338 --> 02:52:04.538]  Ready Made Resources.

[02:52:08.826 --> 02:52:25.101]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[02:52:25.342 --> 02:52:28.825]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[02:52:29.125 --> 02:52:32.726]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[02:52:32.986 --> 02:52:34.407]  Hdfirearms.com.
[02:52:34.667 --> 02:52:37.868]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[02:52:37.988 --> 02:52:42.869]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[02:52:43.069 --> 02:52:46.750]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[02:52:46.970 --> 02:52:49.251]  Go to their website, hdfirearms.com.
[02:52:49.331 --> 02:52:53.552]  Buy right off their website, and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice.
[02:52:53.753 --> 02:52:54.953]  You can pick it up at the gun show.
[02:52:55.213 --> 02:52:56.896]  You can pick it up at a local sporting goods store.
[02:52:57.056 --> 02:53:01.183]  Whatever you do, get your Head Down firearm today.
[02:53:01.404 --> 02:53:05.711]  The spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms.
[02:53:06.032 --> 02:53:06.973]  HDFirearms.com
[02:53:08.547 --> 02:53:09.608]  Honey, it's time for dinner.
[02:53:10.329 --> 02:53:11.750]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[02:53:12.190 --> 02:53:13.451]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[02:53:13.671 --> 02:53:14.792]  Mine has fallen apart.
[02:53:15.233 --> 02:53:21.017]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[02:53:21.378 --> 02:53:24.200]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[02:53:24.600 --> 02:53:25.141]  What is that?
[02:53:25.441 --> 02:53:34.549]  Well, apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[02:53:34.989 --> 02:53:43.396]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[02:53:43.717 --> 02:53:44.037]  Wow!
[02:53:44.337 --> 02:53:45.278]  That sounds scary.
[02:53:45.658 --> 02:53:50.002]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold shielded wallet.
[02:53:50.102 --> 02:53:50.943]  Are they more expensive?
[02:53:51.363 --> 02:53:51.603]  No.
[02:53:51.883 --> 02:53:59.128]  In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from IDStronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[02:53:59.569 --> 02:54:00.389]  Sounds great!
[02:54:00.749 --> 02:54:03.351]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[02:54:03.371 --> 02:54:07.454]  I want to be protected, and these wallets at IDStronghold.com look fantastic!
[02:54:15.666 --> 02:54:18.207]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[02:54:18.247 --> 02:54:20.587]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[02:54:20.647 --> 02:54:23.888]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[02:54:23.948 --> 02:54:28.509]  And everybody knew he didn't give no lip to Big John.
[02:54:29.069 --> 02:54:31.349]  Big John!
[02:54:31.829 --> 02:54:34.150]  Big John!
[02:54:34.670 --> 02:54:37.071]  Big Bad John!
[02:54:37.551 --> 02:54:38.611]  Big John!
[02:54:39.778 --> 02:54:47.826]  John, right before it's our guest, we're going to do five minutes overdrive to cover this new ABC News show, Becoming Us, about dads all becoming trannies.
[02:54:47.906 --> 02:54:49.908]  This is a biological attack.
[02:54:50.629 --> 02:54:53.171]  It's happening to fish, amphibians, because of the chemicals.
[02:54:53.351 --> 02:54:57.295]  As this becomes more widespread, they're not going to say, why is it happening?
[02:54:57.916 --> 02:55:01.059]  They're going to say, oh, it's just a cultural thing.
[02:55:01.079 --> 02:55:02.160]  And part of it is cultural.
[02:55:02.620 --> 02:55:04.041]  But most of it's chemical.
[02:55:04.301 --> 02:55:11.343]  I'll get John Rappaport's take on that in a moment, because we can say we're having victories, and we are, but they're hitting us with a scientific attack.
[02:55:12.784 --> 02:55:16.545]  Now, by the way, most patriots aren't into getting credit.
[02:55:16.845 --> 02:55:19.446]  The people are trying to give us credit for stopping TPP?
[02:55:19.526 --> 02:55:19.746]  No.
[02:55:20.807 --> 02:55:22.688]  This broadcast is a small part of that.
[02:55:23.748 --> 02:55:25.248]  You, the listeners, are a big part of that.
[02:55:25.709 --> 02:55:28.190]  Most neocon talk radio was pushing it.
[02:55:28.770 --> 02:55:31.151]  Some were kind of on the fence, but DrudgeReport.com,
[02:55:32.606 --> 02:55:35.247]  Has us triple linked today covering Bilderberg.
[02:55:35.648 --> 02:55:41.491]  Drudge is the only mega site that will cover this and has the courage and has the Pentagon talking trash about him for it.
[02:55:41.851 --> 02:55:43.592]  Not the military, the people that run the Pentagon.
[02:55:44.532 --> 02:55:49.395]  We have three links on Drudge today breaking down what's happening in Bilderberg.
[02:55:50.768 --> 02:55:51.529]  That's exciting.
[02:55:52.411 --> 02:55:54.033]  The Democrats get credit.
[02:55:54.073 --> 02:56:02.506]  The grassroots Democrats are sane enough to go, no, we shouldn't have secret bills being passed, and it shouldn't be foreign corporations and governments.
[02:56:03.387 --> 02:56:04.769]  And that's a big deal.
[02:56:04.789 --> 02:56:05.650]  That's why we have two parties.
[02:56:08.134 --> 02:56:12.338]  The Tea Party leading the charge deserves credit.
[02:56:12.778 --> 02:56:21.266]  And it shows how we all need to come together on sanity and not all call each other racist and homophobes because we don't want five-year-olds taught how to be trannies or whatever.
[02:56:21.326 --> 02:56:23.568]  I mean, that shouldn't be taught, period.
[02:56:24.229 --> 02:56:24.549]  Okay?
[02:56:24.609 --> 02:56:26.190]  I mean, you shouldn't be doing that.
[02:56:26.310 --> 02:56:27.271]  It's a distraction.
[02:56:28.152 --> 02:56:30.474]  This whole gay marriage thing, it's a state issue.
[02:56:30.754 --> 02:56:31.735]  Read the Constitution.
[02:56:32.435 --> 02:56:39.180]  I mean, if gay people want to have the lawyers ruin their lives and, you know, get thrown in the divorce mill, you're idiots.
[02:56:39.220 --> 02:56:39.821]  But whatever.
[02:56:40.261 --> 02:56:42.523]  I don't say that because I hate you because you're gay.
[02:56:42.843 --> 02:56:44.804]  I say it because it's all a political football.
[02:56:45.125 --> 02:56:46.766]  John Rappaport, how do we beat these people?
[02:56:47.066 --> 02:56:48.287]  And then Leanne, jump in any time.
[02:56:49.868 --> 02:56:53.130]  Well, we start to beat them by, and you mentioned this earlier,
[02:56:54.176 --> 02:56:56.479]  What are your principles as an individual?
[02:56:56.519 --> 02:56:57.520]  What do you stand for?
[02:56:58.241 --> 02:56:58.821]  You don't know?
[02:56:58.881 --> 02:57:00.343]  You better find out right now.
[02:57:00.904 --> 02:57:02.365]  What is freedom, really?
[02:57:03.086 --> 02:57:04.047]  What is it all about?
[02:57:04.167 --> 02:57:05.129]  Freedom from what?
[02:57:05.449 --> 02:57:06.770]  Freedom means I can wear a dress.
[02:57:07.031 --> 02:57:08.653]  I don't have any other freedoms, but I can wear a dress.
[02:57:09.213 --> 02:57:09.673]  Exactly.
[02:57:09.993 --> 02:57:16.615]  And if that is the limit that a person can conceive, you know, well, I'm white, but I can say I'm black.
[02:57:16.695 --> 02:57:18.976]  Well, I'm a human, but I can say I'm a fish.
[02:57:19.276 --> 02:57:19.696]  That's it.
[02:57:20.156 --> 02:57:21.596]  You know, that's the limit of my freedom.
[02:57:21.656 --> 02:57:22.697]  Well, we're in trouble then.
[02:57:23.257 --> 02:57:24.757]  We have to go back to basics.
[02:57:24.977 --> 02:57:26.277]  What does freedom really mean?
[02:57:26.337 --> 02:57:27.818]  And individuals have to do that.
[02:57:28.278 --> 02:57:30.539]  Many more than already are doing it.
[02:57:30.559 --> 02:57:32.259]  And there are a lot that are doing it.
[02:57:32.299 --> 02:57:36.120]  And then those individuals look at the world and they say, hey, wait a minute.
[02:57:37.335 --> 02:57:44.440]  We're giving away the government of this country to some superstructure of globalists, bankers, and mega-corporations.
[02:57:44.840 --> 02:57:48.423]  That doesn't sound like freedom to me, and I can't even know the details of that.
[02:57:48.703 --> 02:57:49.164]  Forget it.
[02:57:49.784 --> 02:57:51.485]  I'm going up against that.
[02:57:51.585 --> 02:57:52.106]  That's what.
[02:57:52.326 --> 02:58:00.692]  And then you recognize the Bruce Jenner thing is a sickening carnival distraction, like the bearded lady, which is just a reverse of that, folks.
[02:58:00.732 --> 02:58:01.472]  It's freak show.
[02:58:02.753 --> 02:58:07.454]  And I'm not saying people think their women are freaks, I'm saying they're using Carnival Barker tactics on us.
[02:58:07.735 --> 02:58:10.495]  Leigh-Anne, taking a stop to break your take on this situation.
[02:58:10.895 --> 02:58:18.298]  Well, that's just it, because you have a lot of these young people who are in this Black Lives Matter movement, who are actually, you know, wanting to fight back against police brutality and all that.
[02:58:18.338 --> 02:58:26.460]  Well, now you've got them all sort of infighting against what's white, what's black, you know, is this white privilege, and going away from the real issues.
[02:58:27.040 --> 02:58:34.547]  And Jerry Seinfeld's 13-year-old daughter, her mom said, hey, we're going to move back to New York City so you can be around more boys instead of the countryside.
[02:58:34.567 --> 02:58:36.849]  And she said, just to say boys is sexist.
[02:58:37.709 --> 02:58:38.991]  Just girls with boys is bad.
[02:58:39.571 --> 02:58:42.994]  See, I mean, it's just, it's mind control.
[02:58:43.034 --> 02:58:44.676]  They're just scrambling everybody's brains.
[02:58:45.636 --> 02:58:48.339]  More on Bilderberg coming up with Leanne McAdoo and John Rappaport.
[02:58:48.379 --> 02:58:49.220]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:49.260 --> 02:58:50.681]  I'll be back this Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:50.781 --> 02:58:52.242]  Central, Central, Central.
[02:58:54.485 --> 02:58:56.786]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:59.447 --> 02:59:04.449]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.

[02:59:27.380 --> 02:59:28.561]  Alex Jones here.
[02:59:30.262 --> 02:59:39.268]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:59:39.528 --> 02:59:43.110]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[02:59:51.675 --> 02:59:53.956]  Visit Infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:59:53.976 --> 02:59:54.677]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:54.697 --> 02:59:56.298]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.139 --> 03:00:18.164]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:18.765 --> 03:00:21.787]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:22.668 --> 03:00:30.835]  The headlines up on Infowars.com, Shaquille O'Neal questions whether 9-11's an inside job, everything from Building 7 to you name it.
[03:00:31.997 --> 03:00:34.660]  Well, my respect for Shaquille O'Neal just went up quite a bit.
[03:00:34.780 --> 03:00:38.966]  I gotta be honest, I don't know much about him other than he's a successful entrepreneur in business.
[03:00:39.586 --> 03:00:41.809]  Separately, really good at real estate, you name it.
[03:00:41.829 --> 03:00:44.873]  They say he's one of the smartest investors in the NBA.
[03:00:45.654 --> 03:00:48.697]  And you gotta be an idiot not to know 9-11 was an inside job.
[03:00:49.358 --> 03:00:51.839]  The question is exactly how was it carried out inside.
[03:00:52.159 --> 03:00:53.620]  Very positive that's coming out.
[03:00:53.940 --> 03:00:55.441]  The awakening is accelerating.
[03:00:55.461 --> 03:00:56.661]  Sure, he's 14 years late.
[03:00:57.021 --> 03:00:57.521]  So what?
[03:00:57.962 --> 03:00:59.882]  Who cares if you're late to the party as long as you get there.
[03:01:00.262 --> 03:01:02.263]  That takes even more sometimes.
[03:01:02.523 --> 03:01:05.785]  But let's play this clip of the stuff they're pumping at kids.
[03:01:06.265 --> 03:01:08.526]  You don't learn reading and writing in arithmetic, but you learn
[03:01:09.286 --> 03:01:13.349]  I see this with all the trendies, where the dad is feeding the kid, and the dad goes and changes the diaper.
[03:01:13.849 --> 03:01:14.730]  Why don't you share it?
[03:01:14.770 --> 03:01:17.252]  No, no, it's all about how the dad also goes to work.
[03:01:17.752 --> 03:01:21.595]  I mean, dad, and these men get off on being emasculated.
[03:01:21.975 --> 03:01:27.078]  Well, because we've been conquered by men, the globalists, so they taught us how cool it was not to have men.
[03:01:27.699 --> 03:01:30.080]  That's the first thing a conquering group does, is just kill your men.
[03:01:30.321 --> 03:01:36.625]  Well, now they just put stuff in your water and turn you into a pat, or whatever that was on Saturday Night Live.
[03:01:37.065 --> 03:01:37.966]  Let's play this clip.
[03:01:39.346 --> 03:01:40.347]  Hey, I'm Ben.
[03:01:40.707 --> 03:01:43.349]  I'm in high school, and I have a girlfriend.
[03:01:43.569 --> 03:01:53.055]  So I found out that my parents, A, were getting divorced, and B, my dad is becoming a woman.
[03:01:53.455 --> 03:01:53.875]  Whoa.
[03:01:55.296 --> 03:01:56.136]  Hi, my name's Carly.
[03:01:56.737 --> 03:01:57.517]  Used to be Charlie.
[03:01:57.857 --> 03:01:58.538]  Now I'm Carly.
[03:01:58.558 --> 03:01:59.779]  I'm gonna have surgery.
[03:02:00.419 --> 03:02:01.960]  How does it make you feel?
[03:02:02.100 --> 03:02:04.762]  It's kind of official that my dad is gone.
[03:02:06.280 --> 03:02:09.261]  We found out that both of our dads are, like, in the same situation.
[03:02:09.281 --> 03:02:13.342]  I was 10 years old when my dad explained that he wanted to be a woman.
[03:02:13.362 --> 03:02:17.864]  If I fall, you're always there to pick me up.
[03:02:17.904 --> 03:02:19.544]  We're not gonna play any more of this propaganda.
[03:02:19.564 --> 03:02:20.484]  We're analyzing it.
[03:02:21.785 --> 03:02:21.885]  Um...
[03:02:23.337 --> 03:02:27.940]  Again, this is being done to completely confuse the civilization.
[03:02:27.980 --> 03:02:31.002]  This is a scientific takedown, which is the snake eating itself.
[03:02:31.262 --> 03:02:38.087]  The globalists use the West to run their empire, but they hate anything independent, so they're trying to destroy it as well.
[03:02:42.165 --> 03:02:43.486]  Well, unbelievable.
[03:02:44.066 --> 03:02:50.011]  You know, little kids have 50 different ideas a day about what they want to do when they grow up.
[03:02:50.091 --> 03:03:00.318]  You know, so if we all wanted to be a fireman when we were five years old and then somebody stepped in and said, right on, brother, and we're going to make sure that's what you do.
[03:03:00.938 --> 03:03:02.259]  There's no way out now.
[03:03:02.319 --> 03:03:04.541]  This is really great that you want to be a fireman.
[03:03:04.981 --> 03:03:05.882]  Let's call slavery.
[03:03:06.542 --> 03:03:10.164]  You know, and these kids are not being left alone to be themselves.
[03:03:10.704 --> 03:03:13.966]  They're being bombarded with this crap about you can be this, you can be that.
[03:03:14.026 --> 03:03:15.967]  Because again, you're not going to have a job in the future.
[03:03:16.027 --> 03:03:17.127]  Robots have replaced you.
[03:03:17.387 --> 03:03:20.389]  Your new career is being asexual.
[03:03:20.809 --> 03:03:21.249]  Exactly.
[03:03:21.309 --> 03:03:22.390]  Choosing your identity.
[03:03:22.430 --> 03:03:23.710]  This is now the new career.
[03:03:24.371 --> 03:03:29.033]  OK, I want to be a, you know, flowering gardenia plant.
[03:03:29.373 --> 03:03:29.693]  OK, great.
[03:03:29.733 --> 03:03:33.375]  What do they call the new trendies that can't get any jobs because they shut us down with globalism?
[03:03:33.955 --> 03:03:35.496]  The urban creatives.
[03:03:38.522 --> 03:03:40.284]  I mean, I heard them on the TV today.
[03:03:40.484 --> 03:03:45.248]  Well, they sit around and drink coffee and tell you how smart they are and follow what the government says.
[03:03:45.669 --> 03:03:48.552]  Oh, aren't they delicate geniuses that can't wipe their own arse?
[03:03:48.652 --> 03:03:49.292]  Leanne McAdoo.
[03:03:49.312 --> 03:03:52.315]  And just keep continuing to go to school again and again.
[03:03:52.335 --> 03:03:53.556]  But they're dumb jellyfish.
[03:03:53.576 --> 03:03:55.618]  They're better than me that built my own media operation.
[03:03:55.838 --> 03:03:56.019]  Right.
[03:03:56.559 --> 03:03:58.140]  Well, because they've got like 20 degrees.
[03:03:58.661 --> 03:04:06.347]  Well, I think you guys nailed it earlier when you said that this is distracting people to let them decide what is freedom and what is not freedom.
[03:04:06.427 --> 03:04:08.369]  Hey, I live in America.
[03:04:08.449 --> 03:04:08.950]  I'm free.
[03:04:09.130 --> 03:04:11.492]  If I want to be a woman, this is a free country.
[03:04:11.892 --> 03:04:14.594]  And so that's where this new debate is of this is what is freedom.
[03:04:14.955 --> 03:04:20.579]  Don't look at the fact that our government is now being turned into a global governance structure.
[03:04:21.345 --> 03:04:24.467]  You know, that's what they're deciding on right now, there, in D.C.
[03:04:24.507 --> 03:04:25.488]  Don't even think about that.
[03:04:25.568 --> 03:04:26.249]  Don't worry about that.
[03:04:26.309 --> 03:04:30.792]  We just want to know if you think that this is okay, that Charlie is now Carly.
[03:04:31.533 --> 03:04:32.173]  See the article?
[03:04:32.193 --> 03:04:33.214]  They're called yuckies.
[03:04:34.515 --> 03:04:34.995]  Yuckies?
[03:04:35.396 --> 03:04:36.356]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:04:36.537 --> 03:04:38.578]  I was on the treadmill, or I keep saying treadmill.
[03:04:38.598 --> 03:04:39.699]  We're gonna do more overdrive.
[03:04:39.999 --> 03:04:41.761]  Ravenport, you gotta go or you're gonna stay ten more minutes.
[03:04:42.443 --> 03:04:42.863]  I can go.
[03:04:42.883 --> 03:04:43.223]  I can stay.
[03:04:43.263 --> 03:04:43.503]  Great, great.
[03:04:43.523 --> 03:04:44.204]  Stay there too, Leanne.
[03:04:44.704 --> 03:04:54.347]  I'm sitting there on the elliptical this morning, and I've got the audio on, and it was local ABC, and they're going, they're young urban creatives, oh, and just shut them up, like, oh, oh, oh.
[03:04:54.407 --> 03:05:08.812]  And they basically admitted, they don't have jobs, but they've got three degrees, and they just walk around like, oh, we're so cool, oh, oh, oh, because they can't admit that they were set up, have $200,000 in debt, the globalists totally screwed them over, but they've got socks that are a different color, so it's okay.
[03:05:10.134 --> 03:05:12.516]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[03:05:12.736 --> 03:05:13.676]  Get back to nature.

[03:06:09.324 --> 03:06:25.581]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[03:06:25.821 --> 03:06:29.285]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[03:06:29.625 --> 03:06:33.227]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[03:06:33.467 --> 03:06:34.887]  HDfirearms.com.
[03:06:35.147 --> 03:06:38.369]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[03:06:38.469 --> 03:06:43.331]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.

[03:06:55.816 --> 03:06:57.358]  Pick it up at a local sporting goods store.
[03:06:57.539 --> 03:07:01.685]  Whatever you do, get your Head Down firearm today.
[03:07:01.906 --> 03:07:06.212]  The spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms.

[03:07:10.260 --> 03:07:17.166]  Many are in disbelief today after word of shocking allegations against a Minnesota-based talk syndication company known as GCN.
[03:07:17.646 --> 03:07:28.235]  It's claimed that they're the fourth largest talk syndication company in the U.S., making it even more scandalous that they've been accused of helping business owners expose themselves on a massive scale.
[03:07:28.855 --> 03:07:30.977]  Let's go live to Tom for more on this story.
[03:07:31.597 --> 03:07:34.518]  It's being called the greatest exposure of our lifetime.
[03:07:34.858 --> 03:07:41.661]  While other business owners are beginning to step forward claiming they too exposed themselves with the help of GCN.
[03:07:41.981 --> 03:07:43.181]  It's true, they're all guilty.
[03:07:43.361 --> 03:07:44.382]  Every last one of them.
[03:07:44.702 --> 03:07:48.843]  GCN helped me get the exposure my company needed and just think, that was years ago.
[03:07:49.304 --> 03:07:55.086]  Today, GCN has like 700 affiliate stations and over 6 million downloads from iTunes and their website every month.
[03:07:55.526 --> 03:07:58.007]  Imagine the exposure your company can get.
[03:07:59.367 --> 03:08:17.771]  In today's world, abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and attempt to bully activists.
[03:08:18.511 --> 03:08:26.453]  If you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshippers, maybe you can call the A-Team.
[03:08:29.389 --> 03:08:30.369]  How many did I adopt?
[03:08:30.689 --> 03:08:31.530]  I kill my kids.
[03:08:32.010 --> 03:08:33.290]  I kill my kids.
[03:08:37.872 --> 03:08:43.353]  Hey, we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle.
[03:08:44.174 --> 03:08:45.014]  That's pretty cool, man.
[03:08:46.134 --> 03:08:49.835]  Is that you on the Facebook?
[03:08:49.916 --> 03:08:52.056]  Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[03:08:52.876 --> 03:08:53.697]  I don't think so.
[03:08:59.071 --> 03:09:03.154]  How do you get your abortions paid for?
[03:09:04.035 --> 03:09:04.695]  I pay for them.
[03:09:05.215 --> 03:09:05.476]  Really?
[03:09:05.556 --> 03:09:07.837]  How many do you pay for them?
[03:09:08.017 --> 03:09:08.418]  Upwards of 50.
[03:09:08.498 --> 03:09:09.378]  Really?
[03:09:09.578 --> 03:09:09.919]  Oh yeah.
[03:09:12.100 --> 03:09:15.903]  F**k you, you piece of s**t!
[03:09:16.323 --> 03:09:18.144]  Bunch of misogynist motherf**kers.
[03:09:18.164 --> 03:09:20.326]  Take your male privilege somewhere else.
[03:09:20.386 --> 03:09:22.107]  Tava, you're being aggressive.
[03:09:22.207 --> 03:09:23.108]  I'm being aggressive.
[03:09:23.843 --> 03:09:25.304]  Excuse us!
[03:09:26.104 --> 03:09:26.324]  Wow!
[03:09:27.244 --> 03:09:30.446]  These, that's the guys that attacked Alex Jones.
[03:09:38.909 --> 03:09:43.971]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:46.661]  Alright, final segment in Overdrive.
[03:09:47.162 --> 03:09:51.085]  So now I've been informed by the crew that is usually more up on trends than I am.
[03:09:51.446 --> 03:09:54.108]  Oh, that yuckies are well known, Zuckerberg's promoting them.
[03:09:54.428 --> 03:09:57.331]  We showed an article out of New York about how wondrous it is.
[03:09:57.671 --> 03:09:59.653]  They don't have jobs, they're deep in debt.
[03:10:00.253 --> 03:10:15.959]  But they're cool, and like little baby birds, they're just basically, you know, fed poisonous vomit from their government mommy, and then they just repeat over and over again whatever they're told, and then think they're like the intellectual elite.
[03:10:16.880 --> 03:10:18.300]  And the Red Guard out of L.A.
[03:10:18.480 --> 03:10:23.943]  that are here in Austin, that go around worshipping Mao, they don't even know that Mao is, like, hated in China, even by the Communists.
[03:10:24.723 --> 03:10:26.764]  I mean, they don't know what planet they're on.
[03:10:27.611 --> 03:10:30.254]  And they actually run and then crawl in dumpsters.
[03:10:32.257 --> 03:10:35.340]  In fact, one time I was at a dance studio picking up my girls.
[03:10:35.360 --> 03:10:36.382]  They were doing some ballet.
[03:10:36.402 --> 03:10:40.847]  They had this other big dance area and I heard these moms going, oh yeah, I love to crawl in dumpsters.
[03:10:40.867 --> 03:10:41.688]  Isn't this a cool thing?
[03:10:41.708 --> 03:10:44.131]  It's so fun to wall around the dumpsters.
[03:10:44.692 --> 03:10:46.995]  And then I heard people talking later about it, so it's just...
[03:10:47.395 --> 03:10:58.763]  Disconnected from reality, living on credit, worshipping big government, having no idea robots from France to China are replacing them, having no idea there's chemical weapons being put in the vaccines, food and water.
[03:10:59.264 --> 03:11:01.325]  I mean, imagine when stuff collapses.
[03:11:01.385 --> 03:11:07.310]  These people... I mean, you go to downtown Austin, there are literal hordes of yuckies.
[03:11:08.288 --> 03:11:18.876]  Wandering around, they're saying the hipster's dead, and they're saying the yucky capital in these articles, Zuckerberg is commanding them, I'm not joking, it actually says it, are being deployed to Austin to bring down Texas.
[03:11:19.177 --> 03:11:19.777]  Good lord.
[03:11:19.837 --> 03:11:22.279]  I mean, you talk about zombie invasion, folks.
[03:11:22.920 --> 03:11:24.361]  You talk about zombos.
[03:11:24.961 --> 03:11:26.402]  I mean, they are it.
[03:11:26.963 --> 03:11:28.804]  And again, they are the enlightened ones.
[03:11:28.824 --> 03:11:30.946]  They know like three words, racist, sexist, homophobe.
[03:11:31.266 --> 03:11:33.328]  And they just bleat them over and over again.
[03:11:33.348 --> 03:11:38.572]  And again, Austin, I guess God put me here for a reason.
[03:11:38.592 --> 03:11:39.853]  My mom's from here.
[03:11:40.413 --> 03:11:43.495]  So I just, you know, 25 years ago to battle these people.
[03:11:43.696 --> 03:11:48.860]  I was here long before they arrived to try to build our command base to contend with them.
[03:11:49.280 --> 03:11:58.908]  And you can laugh at them, but something this demonic, this weak, this artificial, this pathetic, it's like Hercules when he's sent to hell in one of his labors to rescue somebody.
[03:11:59.628 --> 03:12:09.060]  In the total darkness, you just don't even know how to fight them, because they're just... How do you fight people stumbling, drooling, saying, I kill my kids, and then crawling in trash cans?
[03:12:09.561 --> 03:12:11.583]  Because there's more of them than us, and they can vote.
[03:12:11.884 --> 03:12:14.848]  How do you defeat the hordes of evil, John Rappaport?
[03:12:17.486 --> 03:12:21.228]  Well, first of all, I would call them zuckies instead of yuckies.
[03:12:22.169 --> 03:12:27.873]  And, uh, you know, let's just go after Facebook because this is the Facebook generation, right?
[03:12:28.553 --> 03:12:29.634]  You can be a troll.
[03:12:30.194 --> 03:12:32.616]  You can put up little photos of yourself.
[03:12:32.736 --> 03:12:39.260]  You can say, well, is it a racist, homophobe, whatever, over and over again, and somehow you can survive.
[03:12:39.840 --> 03:12:44.203]  So this seems to me, we should recharacterize it as the Facebook generation.
[03:12:44.423 --> 03:12:44.723]  I agree.
[03:12:44.763 --> 03:12:46.024]  Zuckies!
[03:12:46.164 --> 03:12:47.545]  They're launching this meme this week.
[03:12:47.805 --> 03:12:49.887]  Let's hijack yuckies and make them zuckies.
[03:12:50.347 --> 03:12:57.872]  And explain to them that you're deep in debt, you've been conned, you love the system, you think doubling down on the system will save your ass.
[03:12:58.113 --> 03:12:59.514]  You're called a total loser.
[03:13:01.315 --> 03:13:04.297]  Zucky equals schmuck extraordinaire.
[03:13:04.337 --> 03:13:04.637]  Sorry.
[03:13:04.657 --> 03:13:07.639]  I apologize, I'm ranting.
[03:13:07.839 --> 03:13:08.580]  Go ahead, Rappaport.
[03:13:09.420 --> 03:13:10.661]  No, go ahead, Leanne.
[03:13:10.881 --> 03:13:11.482]  I'm finished.
[03:13:11.622 --> 03:13:12.282]  I got zucky.
[03:13:12.342 --> 03:13:12.563]  That's it.
[03:13:13.647 --> 03:13:14.708]  You coined the term Zucky.
[03:13:14.848 --> 03:13:16.129]  All hail John Rappaport.
[03:13:17.850 --> 03:13:28.736]  Well, I mean, that's basically it, is that they're trying to program them, and by making it trendy and cool, that they have no jobs, no future, they'll be deep in debt, and they'll have nothing to do.
[03:13:28.756 --> 03:13:29.937]  Why are you a Zuck-a-phobe?
[03:13:30.057 --> 03:13:31.938]  Sit around and eating artisanal donuts.
[03:13:33.379 --> 03:13:34.720]  I'm a proud Zuck-a-phobe.
[03:13:35.689 --> 03:13:35.889]  Yeah.
[03:13:36.430 --> 03:13:37.571]  What's going to happen, Leigh-Anne?
[03:13:37.591 --> 03:13:38.512]  What's going to happen, John?
[03:13:38.552 --> 03:13:42.936]  First, Leigh-Anne, when all this goes belly-up, which it is, the Globals are running to bunkers right now.
[03:13:43.257 --> 03:13:46.480]  God knows when it... I hope it doesn't happen, but it's inevitable.
[03:13:46.941 --> 03:13:50.124]  What happens when the next Great Depression hits to the Zuckey horde?
[03:13:51.597 --> 03:13:56.220]  I mean, they're going to be the ones that are teaching us how to get our food out of garbage cans.
[03:13:56.740 --> 03:13:57.020]  You know?
[03:13:57.040 --> 03:13:57.920]  I mean, that's frightening.
[03:13:58.141 --> 03:13:58.881]  Wait a minute, that's true!
[03:13:58.941 --> 03:14:03.603]  At Whole Foods and everywhere, they promote this poor culture of not having money, even though it's a rip-off.
[03:14:04.024 --> 03:14:07.646]  And so I guess they are pre-positioning to be losers in the Depression.
[03:14:07.866 --> 03:14:08.106]  Right.
[03:14:09.026 --> 03:14:10.987]  Oh, that's why it's sexy to be bankrupt.
[03:14:11.227 --> 03:14:13.789]  They realize they've been conned, so now they're going with it.
[03:14:14.509 --> 03:14:17.570]  They're embracing the fact that they were conned.
[03:14:17.670 --> 03:14:18.590]  Oh, I get it.
[03:14:18.610 --> 03:14:20.371]  Yeah, that's the thing with the hipsters.
[03:14:20.391 --> 03:14:21.551]  They're always a step ahead.
[03:14:21.571 --> 03:14:27.133]  Wait a minute, Rappaport, they're geniuses.
[03:14:27.793 --> 03:14:28.653]  They're Confucians.
[03:14:29.173 --> 03:14:31.394]  The garbage can movement.
[03:14:32.354 --> 03:14:33.175]  How to get food.
[03:14:34.635 --> 03:14:35.996]  Wow, who thought of that?
[03:14:36.056 --> 03:14:36.596]  That's great.
[03:14:37.036 --> 03:14:39.917]  Well, the thing about them, and I'm not joking, they worship trash dumpsters.
[03:14:40.117 --> 03:14:40.977]  Yeah, I forget what it's called.
[03:14:40.997 --> 03:14:42.417]  They ran and were hugging them.
[03:14:45.353 --> 03:14:58.301]  Now there's a whole movement and they have like secret symbols that they spray paint on the garbage cans that this garbage can has rotten food in it, this one's good, it usually has fresh food in it, or we've already ransacked this garbage can, all the good food's been taken out.
[03:14:58.321 --> 03:14:59.581]  So they're quasi-homeless.
[03:15:00.002 --> 03:15:00.222]  Yeah.
[03:15:00.982 --> 03:15:02.683]  But they still support the system, they love it.
[03:15:02.963 --> 03:15:03.123]  Right.
[03:15:03.584 --> 03:15:08.186]  Well that's how that one kid said he pays for all of his abortions, is that he gets the money donated to him.
[03:15:08.547 --> 03:15:08.747]  So.
[03:15:11.128 --> 03:15:11.649]  Zuckies.
[03:15:12.049 --> 03:15:12.189]  Yep.
[03:15:12.987 --> 03:15:24.169]  But then they always have, like, the guy driving on the $80,000 brand-new Jaguar, who's the foundation minion, who's managing them, and they go and, like, sit around a professor and worship him, and he just goes, ehhh.
[03:15:24.449 --> 03:15:25.749]  The women just give themselves.
[03:15:25.789 --> 03:15:26.709]  They're just like, ehhh.
[03:15:27.129 --> 03:15:30.070]  So smart, with your eight degrees, no doubt.
[03:15:30.470 --> 03:15:31.630]  I will send you out.
[03:15:31.690 --> 03:15:32.850]  Crawl in the trash can.
[03:15:33.971 --> 03:15:36.751]  And you're the worst of the worst, because you are a white alpha male.
[03:15:37.431 --> 03:15:37.971]  I am?
[03:15:38.251 --> 03:15:38.872]  Oh, yeah.
[03:15:39.532 --> 03:15:39.972]  You're done.
[03:15:40.572 --> 03:15:41.352]  You've had your time.
[03:15:42.776 --> 03:15:44.376]  They tell me they're going to rent Jeremy.
[03:15:44.936 --> 03:15:46.297]  You're anti-dumpster.
[03:15:46.757 --> 03:15:47.077]  Yes.
[03:15:47.157 --> 03:15:47.697]  That's the problem.
[03:15:48.157 --> 03:15:49.257]  How dare you?
[03:15:52.198 --> 03:15:58.739]  Meanwhile, don't they know this whole mind control was written basically by globalists who just so happen to a lot of them be white alpha males?
[03:16:00.580 --> 03:16:07.581]  Well, Zucki's, you know, Facebook CIA money basically, you know, kept it on the map and created it.
[03:16:07.621 --> 03:16:10.782]  So these are just sort of little CIA clones.
[03:16:11.621 --> 03:16:12.962]  Running around these duckies.
[03:16:13.863 --> 03:16:16.504]  What do you call the fake liberals that are so fascist?
[03:16:20.047 --> 03:16:21.748]  We need a better name for them.
[03:16:22.048 --> 03:16:25.811]  But, you know, they used to be called limousine liberals, remember those days?
[03:16:26.631 --> 03:16:37.299]  That's when, you know, they would be, we're for everybody that has nothing, while I'm sitting in the back of my limo on Park Avenue on my car phone, calling my broker.
[03:16:39.226 --> 03:16:41.267]  And those type of Democrats would always not pay taxes.
[03:16:42.208 --> 03:16:43.028]  Yeah, they were doing it.
[03:16:43.068 --> 03:16:45.369]  Well, like Kerry with his, what was it, his boat?
[03:16:45.789 --> 03:16:50.290]  They kept moving around in order to avoid taxes up in New England there.
[03:16:51.351 --> 03:16:53.432]  Yeah, they'll do anything to avoid taxes.
[03:16:53.472 --> 03:16:58.954]  They've probably spent half the day figuring out how to avoid taxes because that's how they make most of their money.
[03:17:00.074 --> 03:17:02.575]  So yeah, they were the limousine of liberals.
[03:17:03.335 --> 03:17:04.796]  Now they're, I don't know,
[03:17:05.919 --> 03:17:13.343]  The rich idiots who are trying to, you know, bring everybody else down because they know that government is their friend.
[03:17:13.903 --> 03:17:15.104]  Big government is their friend.
[03:17:15.124 --> 03:17:16.325]  Big government protects them.
[03:17:17.065 --> 03:17:26.731]  Big government protects big money, Wall Street, corporations, which are all tied into the globalist takeover, so they feel like they're immune, they're on the right side.
[03:17:26.871 --> 03:17:34.315]  And that big system gives the Zuckys a little piece of chicken feed so they worship it, not knowing
[03:17:34.915 --> 03:17:37.476]  They're a prisoner in a cage being given food three times a day.
[03:17:37.496 --> 03:17:40.616]  I mean, I'd resent somebody giving me food in a cage.
[03:17:41.297 --> 03:17:46.038]  I wouldn't be, oh, thank you, and then hate people that were outside trying to blow the wall up to get me out.
[03:17:46.498 --> 03:17:48.138]  Even if it was an artisanal donut?
[03:17:50.879 --> 03:17:53.139]  Well, I'm just not elitistly hating these trendies.
[03:17:53.259 --> 03:17:54.079]  I talk to them.
[03:17:54.320 --> 03:17:55.960]  They're so stupid.
[03:17:57.611 --> 03:18:01.895]  And it's very frustrating and infuriating that they think that you're so stupid.
[03:18:02.155 --> 03:18:02.636]  You know what I mean?
[03:18:02.836 --> 03:18:07.020]  Like a self-made human being who has built his own empire, has tons of empires.
[03:18:07.040 --> 03:18:07.661]  Not an empire.
[03:18:08.121 --> 03:18:09.202]  Oh, of course it is!
[03:18:09.883 --> 03:18:12.305]  You know, but we, you know, we're the bad guys.
[03:18:12.626 --> 03:18:15.348]  Because we don't, you know, believe in killing our kids and...
[03:18:16.349 --> 03:18:20.293]  Fighting the system by by killing everyone and getting us all to kill each other.
[03:18:20.314 --> 03:18:22.176]  We're not even judging people that have had abortions.
[03:18:22.196 --> 03:18:24.878]  We're just saying the globalists are pushing it for a bad reason.
[03:18:25.499 --> 03:18:27.221]  John Rappaport, big victory today.
[03:18:27.281 --> 03:18:30.805]  Great articles on Bilderberg at nomorefakenews.com.
[03:18:30.825 --> 03:18:31.426]  We commend you.
[03:18:31.446 --> 03:18:34.629]  I want to get you on soon about your books and just about things in general.
[03:18:34.649 --> 03:18:36.992]  45 second closing comment and then we end.
[03:18:39.226 --> 03:18:41.187]  Don't forget about freedom, folks.
[03:18:41.827 --> 03:18:42.867]  This is not going away.
[03:18:42.947 --> 03:18:48.049]  Just because we had a great victory right now, they're coming back for more.
[03:18:48.089 --> 03:18:49.609]  They want to pass these treaties.
[03:18:49.649 --> 03:18:52.010]  They're going to do whatever they possibly can to do it.
[03:18:52.950 --> 03:18:58.852]  And they have to know that millions of us are awake and we're not going to take it.
[03:19:00.074 --> 03:19:00.595]  Absolutely not.
[03:19:18.186 --> 03:19:19.227]  What an idiocy, Leanne!
[03:19:19.427 --> 03:19:28.073]  Right, absolutely, and that's why we can't be distracted by everything they've got going on out there, because they do want to bring back this whole TPP and TPA as early as next week.
[03:19:28.093 --> 03:19:41.724]  They're just going to keep on bringing it back around, wearing us down, and it is about global governance, putting it in place with this TPP, and the key is that it's going to be a six-year fast-track authorization.
[03:19:42.244 --> 03:19:45.086]  So the next president will have, you know, it's a living document.
[03:19:45.126 --> 03:19:45.967]  They can do whatever they want.
[03:19:46.067 --> 03:19:47.607]  Yeah, that's one reason the Democrats didn't do this.
[03:19:47.627 --> 03:19:49.768]  We're not giving the Republican dictatorial power for four years.
[03:19:50.248 --> 03:19:51.629]  I mean, you don't give anyone that.
[03:19:51.909 --> 03:19:52.089]  Right.
[03:19:53.189 --> 03:19:55.149]  Leanne McAdoo, great job.
[03:19:55.189 --> 03:19:56.210]  Who's hosting the news tonight?
[03:19:56.450 --> 03:19:56.670]  Me.
[03:19:57.250 --> 03:20:00.991]  Leanne McAdoo, 7 o'clock Central, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:20:01.251 --> 03:20:02.091]  Great job, Rappaport.
[03:20:02.111 --> 03:20:02.852]  Great job, crew.
[03:20:03.132 --> 03:20:04.012]  See you this Sunday.
[03:20:04.492 --> 03:20:06.853]  Lord Willard, don't take this show for granted, folks.
[03:20:06.893 --> 03:20:07.353]  I know I don't.
[03:20:07.373 --> 03:20:10.614]  4 to 6 p.m., thanks for joining us.
[03:20:11.794 --> 03:20:15.495]  It's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the Industry
