[00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.674]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.674 --> 00:00:11.256]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.256 --> 00:00:12.817]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:17.001]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:21.044]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.728 --> 00:00:37.794]  There are many areas of Europe inside places like Brussels, Belgium, and other ghettos inside France where you're not supposed to go if you're a Westerner.
[00:00:37.794 --> 00:00:46.599]  Well, Joe Biggs, Michael Zimmerman, and of course Paul Joseph Watson today went into one of those ghettos in Brussels, Belgium.
[00:00:47.677 --> 00:00:54.462]  That is reportedly the heart of the ISIS base in Europe.
[00:00:54.462 --> 00:01:07.913]  So our reporters were inside the ISIS base in Europe and they were told in shops, in restaurants, on the streets, you get out of here and screamed at in Arabic, French, and in broken English.
[00:01:07.913 --> 00:01:13.257]  So they traveled just about an hour and a half north from Paris into Brussels, Belgium, across the border.
[00:01:14.605 --> 00:01:28.956]  They're in the city of Brussels inside Belgium, and boy, let me tell you, I think we should bring in more of these immigrants so that they can scream at us and tell us we're not welcome, and the politically correct can tell us that they need to be worshipped.
[00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:30.838]  This is wild.
[00:01:30.838 --> 00:01:32.419]  Wild, wild, wild.
[00:01:35.643 --> 00:01:37.223]  They didn't even know it was going to be this intense.
[00:01:37.223 --> 00:01:40.324]  So I've told them, go back if they choose to.
[00:01:40.324 --> 00:01:42.644]  They say, big things are too dangerous.
[00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:44.225]  And actually get footage of this.
[00:01:44.225 --> 00:01:46.945]  I mean, how dramatic is that?
[00:01:46.945 --> 00:01:49.526]  People coming out of shops, you name it, and saying, you're not welcome.
[00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:50.726]  Get out of here.
[00:01:50.726 --> 00:01:52.306]  Because they're white.
[00:01:52.306 --> 00:01:53.606]  They think they're European.
[00:01:53.606 --> 00:01:59.127]  They're screaming at them in Arabic, in French.
[00:01:59.127 --> 00:02:01.808]  And I guess, what do they speak in Belgium?
[00:02:01.808 --> 00:02:02.148]  Flemish?
[00:02:04.073 --> 00:02:06.717]  Just a bunch of gibbering in different languages.
[00:02:06.717 --> 00:02:13.286]  I tell you, I'm really tempted now to get on an airplane myself.
[00:02:13.286 --> 00:02:20.397]  I mean, I was really talking about going and covering the UN Summit next month in Paris, and I just... I'm sorry, I just...
[00:02:22.443 --> 00:02:23.164]  It's just crazy.
[00:02:23.164 --> 00:02:24.726]  This needs to be documented.
[00:02:24.726 --> 00:02:29.451]  They say there's no police for miles and miles, and we know this is in the news.
[00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:35.618]  And European women are just grabbed off the street, drugged back in, and gang raped, and the police will do nothing.
[00:02:35.618 --> 00:02:39.082]  They will not even charge the people that do it from Belgium to Sweden to France.
[00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:43.233]  Man, the people running Europe really do hate Europe.
[00:02:43.233 --> 00:02:45.074]  They really do want to suicide it.
[00:02:45.074 --> 00:02:47.015]  But let me tell you who hates Europe more.
[00:02:47.015 --> 00:02:48.456]  The Europeans.
[00:02:48.456 --> 00:02:53.039]  They want to hide out and be politically correct and think all this is going to blow over.
[00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:55.381]  It's not.
[00:02:55.381 --> 00:03:01.905]  Socialism really is suicide.
[00:03:01.905 --> 00:03:07.729]  Brussels, where you can buy for 500 euros a gun in 30 minutes, has become Europe's jihad capital.
[00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:13.114]  That's right, reporters inside ISIS-based Europe.
[00:03:13.114 --> 00:03:15.656]  That's what it is.
[00:03:15.656 --> 00:03:24.222]  And so I want the guys to, obviously tomorrow, rent a car, go around and surveil this and just show people what's going on.
[00:03:25.276 --> 00:03:29.098]  Big said their cars were following them.
[00:03:29.098 --> 00:03:31.439]  I mean, this has been taken over.
[00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:41.145]  And imagine the arrogance of these jihadis that usually are chopping and murdering and killing each other in their own respective countries and bullying women and blowing up churches.
[00:03:41.145 --> 00:03:49.509]  Now they're in the middle of Europe with just Europeans falling down to worship them.
[00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:53.872]  Absolutely falling down on their faces.
[00:03:55.765 --> 00:03:58.607]  To grovel.
[00:03:58.607 --> 00:04:00.169]  And it's the same thing here.
[00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:09.857]  Whether you're from China or Mexico or Eastern Europe or wherever the case is, we're supposed to just grovel and here's everything free and we're sorry we're so bad.
[00:04:09.857 --> 00:04:15.622]  What a mind-controlled screwjob has been put into the average American's screwed-up brain.
[00:04:17.708 --> 00:04:26.361]  We come back, we're going to intro the piece out of the break with a John Bowne report on all this and then we're going to get into all the huge breaking news today.
[00:04:26.361 --> 00:04:28.224]  There is just so much, but...
[00:04:30.695 --> 00:04:33.536]  They're saying more terror attacks, a new 9-11, race for that.
[00:04:33.536 --> 00:04:39.457]  And then when there's a new 9-11, no one will get in trouble in our criminal governments for opening the borders up and allowing it to happen.
[00:04:39.457 --> 00:04:43.318]  It really is the suspension of common sense and reality.
[00:04:43.318 --> 00:04:45.839]  It really is totally sick.
[00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:52.721]  We've got new Black Lives Matter videos as they descend on Dartmouth students screaming racial apathets at people.
[00:04:52.721 --> 00:04:55.461]  I mean, it is just the suicide of everything that's common sense.
[00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:56.222]  It is madness.
[00:04:56.222 --> 00:04:57.282]  It has left us evil.
[00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:11.234]  CIA boss John Brennan said Monday violating the Fourth Amendment and eliminating the privacy of virtually every American will be required if the United States hopes to stop the attacks by the Islamic State.
[00:05:11.234 --> 00:05:22.343]  He said recent proposed NSA reforms and a return to the principles enshrined in the Constitution will make our ability collectively, internationally to find these terrorists much more challenging.
[00:05:22.643 --> 00:05:32.532]  I would anticipate this is not the only operation ISIL has in the pipeline, Brennan said in remarks delivered at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
[00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:46.324]  During the Intelligence and National Security Summit in September, officials from the FBI, CIA, NSA, NGO, DIA, and NRO decried the deep cynicism of American people over surveillance.
[00:05:46.684 --> 00:05:52.357]  Brennan attributed this to a misunderstanding between the American people and the American government.

[00:08:22.691 --> 00:08:24.152]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:08:30.518 --> 00:08:44.591]  Just a day before the latest highly coordinated massacre in Paris, leaving as many as 160 dead and 200 injured, President Obama declared... ISIS is gaining strength, aren't they?
[00:08:44.591 --> 00:08:46.153]  Well, I don't think they're gaining strength.
[00:08:46.153 --> 00:08:47.214]  What is true is that...
[00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:52.698]  From the start, our goal has been first to contain, and we have contained them.
[00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:59.563]  Was this just an obvious example of the United States' constant failure of war on terror-related intelligence?
[00:08:59.563 --> 00:09:09.710]  Or did Obama make this declaration to his minion, George Stephanopoulos, to distance himself further from the administration's ties to the Frankenstein monster that
[00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:19.073]  that recently claimed to have bombed a Russian airliner over the Sinai Peninsula and would be staging a massive terror event in Paris the very next day.
[00:09:19.073 --> 00:09:23.175]  Obama ensured the American people that ISIS had been contained.
[00:09:23.175 --> 00:09:35.559]  Horrible leadership immediately disrupted as a terror suspect arrested in Paris during the attacks claimed he was from the Islamic State and ISIS later praised the attacks on Twitter.
[00:09:35.559 --> 00:09:39.000]  Oh Crusaders, we're coming to you with bombs and rifles.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.002]  Wait for us, the alleged ISIS tweet read.
[00:09:43.002 --> 00:09:55.668]  Before France's decision to seal its borders Friday in response to the Paris terrorist attacks, the country was only willing to enact border control to protect politicians attending a UN climate change summit.
[00:09:55.988 --> 00:10:12.401]  In other words, the elite will erect walls to protect themselves from radical Islamic terrorists, but they'll let the population fend for themselves and unfortunately, this very attitude created the conditions the terrorists needed to launch multiple attacks in Paris.
[00:10:12.921 --> 00:10:20.207]  There were at least seven separate attacks which were apparently planned to strike public events with a large number of people.
[00:10:20.207 --> 00:10:26.431]  Around 100 people were violently massacred at the Bataclan concert hall during a hostage siege.
[00:10:26.431 --> 00:10:31.095]  At least another 40 people had died in other places around Paris.
[00:10:31.095 --> 00:10:37.880]  Police arrested one terrorist suspect who told them he was with the Islamic State and reportedly from Syria.
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.921]  Although it's likely the U.S.
[00:10:39.921 --> 00:10:55.291]  and NATO will use the Paris attacks as an excuse to launch military operations in Syria, the Pentagon admitted in 2012 that NATO was backing Islamic extremists in a proxy war to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
[00:10:55.291 --> 00:11:02.756]  The Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood, and al-Qaeda in Iraq are the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria.
[00:11:02.756 --> 00:11:04.458]  The Pentagon document stated,
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:08.520]  I think?
[00:11:27.446 --> 00:11:30.648]  If you want a conspiracy theory to exist, that's how you start it!
[00:11:51.219 --> 00:11:54.582]  The most elusive character on the face of the planet.
[00:11:54.582 --> 00:11:56.363]  The most elusive human being.
[00:11:56.363 --> 00:11:58.585]  The Bigfoot of people.
[00:11:58.585 --> 00:12:00.366]  And you catch him and kill him.
[00:12:00.366 --> 00:12:06.331]  But, yeah, we chucked him in the drink right away, because we didn't want any more problems.
[00:12:06.331 --> 00:12:08.032]  John Baum for Influencers.com.
[00:12:21.952 --> 00:12:24.675]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:12:24.675 --> 00:12:27.518]  We are now a good 12 minutes into this worldwide broadcast.
[00:12:27.518 --> 00:12:32.342]  That was a special report and filed by John Bowne from Four Wars Nightly News.
[00:12:32.342 --> 00:12:35.485]  Last night I thought we'd open up the main transmission with that.
[00:12:35.485 --> 00:12:43.954]  It has been reported that Brussels, Belgium is Europe's terror capital and is the capital of ISIS operations.
[00:12:45.083 --> 00:12:59.193]  Well, it's only about an hour and a half away from Paris, so Joe Biggs, Paul Joseph Watson, and of course, Michael Zimmerman, drove from Paris this morning into Brussels, Belgium.
[00:12:59.193 --> 00:13:12.822]  And they got out in one of the areas reportedly controlled by the Islamists, and were told on the street, were told in businesses, were told in restaurants, were told in stores, get out of here, you're not welcome, this is not for you.
[00:13:14.187 --> 00:13:18.988]  In Arabic, in French, in Dutch it appears, and in broken English.
[00:13:18.988 --> 00:13:28.389]  Screamed at, you know, get out of here, get out of here, waving the arms, you leave, followed by cars, basically run out of there.
[00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:34.150]  So, this is what goes on in Europe, and this is what they want to create more of.
[00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:43.352]  Oh see, they're not liberal, they're not inclusive, they're not open arms, and this is where the reported attackers came from.
[00:13:44.844 --> 00:13:59.089]  And the police won't even go into these areas, so I want the guys to go in there undercover with a rent car or with the cabs or whatever and get more footage of this, just to detail, because those are powerful images for people to understand exactly what's unfolding.
[00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:09.452]  They've got some video, but I want to be able to have people actually see this for themselves, because this isn't the big melting pot they want here in the United States, Canada, Australia, and then in Europe.
[00:14:10.404 --> 00:14:27.730]  This is bizarre leftist policies held bent on bringing in radicalized groups from third world countries that are living in the dark ages that other Muslims flee from who don't want to live under this.
[00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:34.813]  And it's a very, very dangerous situation, obviously.
[00:14:34.813 --> 00:14:35.473]  Now, the
[00:14:38.072 --> 00:14:43.816]  News websites, Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com have got a lot of the angles covered.
[00:14:43.816 --> 00:14:51.801]  So does DrudgeReport.com, but there is just so much to get to here, all these different angles.
[00:14:51.801 --> 00:14:55.343]  We have Syrian refugees already missing in Louisiana.
[00:14:57.588 --> 00:15:01.032]  Resettlement group admits we don't track them.
[00:15:01.032 --> 00:15:02.834]  UN demands take them in.
[00:15:02.834 --> 00:15:04.916]  Tells Europe do it, must be done.
[00:15:04.916 --> 00:15:07.018]  Plane load arrives in Britain.
[00:15:07.018 --> 00:15:10.722]  French police in nationwide raids.
[00:15:10.722 --> 00:15:13.785]  Half of America's governors say no to refugees.
[00:15:13.785 --> 00:15:14.826]  There's a map of those.
[00:15:14.826 --> 00:15:15.927]  2,098 Muslims
[00:15:20.433 --> 00:15:22.074]  53 Christians.
[00:15:22.074 --> 00:15:23.795]  That's what's being brought into the U.S.
[00:15:23.795 --> 00:15:27.796]  More headed to 180 towns but avoid D.C.
[00:15:27.796 --> 00:15:31.278]  and other expensive cities.
[00:15:31.278 --> 00:15:34.379]  52% believe makes us less safe.
[00:15:34.379 --> 00:15:37.261]  Republicans move to halt Obama funding.
[00:15:37.261 --> 00:15:39.882]  Speaker Ryan calls for pause on program.
[00:15:39.882 --> 00:15:40.842]  Russia and U.S.
[00:15:40.842 --> 00:15:42.803]  must unite, says French President.
[00:15:44.704 --> 00:15:48.106]  Belgium PM threatens to close some mosque.
[00:15:48.106 --> 00:15:51.948]  German police chief plays down security threat.
[00:15:51.948 --> 00:15:56.110]  East Europe united against Merkel who wants to keep the borders open.
[00:15:56.110 --> 00:16:04.495]  Israel outlaws domestic Islamic movement as police raid offices.
[00:16:04.495 --> 00:16:13.480]  So that's some of the news that's up on DrugsReport.com, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:16:18.305 --> 00:16:27.067]  But Obama is saying that the number of refugees from Syria and elsewhere will be increased to 10,000, excuse me, 100,000 per year.
[00:16:27.067 --> 00:16:28.887]  And we always knew it'd go 100,000, 200,000, 300,000.
[00:16:28.887 --> 00:16:32.448]  Actually, a month ago, they said 100,000.
[00:16:32.448 --> 00:16:37.829]  And then they said 300,000, and the number in the media was 10,000 again.
[00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:39.209]  It's hundreds of thousands.
[00:16:39.209 --> 00:16:39.829]  It's millions.
[00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:42.090]  It's whatever we will put up with.
[00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:43.250]  That's the limit of the tyranny.
[00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:59.280]  Now the French President is saying they must get rid of their Bill of Rights and Constitution and basically have a total police state to counter the threat they brought in that they won't even deal with.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.363]  This is simply mind-blowing.
[00:17:03.363 --> 00:17:10.208]  Absolutely over-the-top mind-blowing.
[00:17:10.208 --> 00:17:13.170]  To have this level
[00:17:16.002 --> 00:17:21.307]  of twisted, bizarre, out-of-the-open craziness.
[00:17:21.307 --> 00:17:23.869]  But it's not craziness.
[00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:27.492]  This is the divide-and-conquer strategy we talk so much about.
[00:17:27.492 --> 00:17:42.245]  A tower of babble, with the Black Lives Matter group running around complaining and, you know, the radical Islamists and the feminists running around and complaining and all the occultists complaining and pulling down crosses across the country and trying to ban Christmas and
[00:17:43.456 --> 00:17:45.777]  Pushing for freebies for anybody that can get here.
[00:17:45.777 --> 00:17:58.524]  And all the big drug companies above the law, able to charge a 2000% price hike on infant seizure drug.
[00:17:58.524 --> 00:18:03.766]  Forced inoculations, nanotech, GMO.
[00:18:03.766 --> 00:18:11.010]  It goes on and on and on.
[00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.911]  And it shakes the mind.
[00:18:15.848 --> 00:18:22.590]  To think about the fact that we have gotten to this point.
[00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:27.572]  It absolutely just makes me wonder what's coming next.
[00:18:27.572 --> 00:18:37.315]  But it's because the average person watches more than five hours of TV a day, pop culture.
[00:18:37.315 --> 00:18:39.115]  They're removed from the land.
[00:18:39.115 --> 00:18:41.796]  They're removed from common sense decisions.
[00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:47.392]  They have no idea how the world really works.
[00:18:47.392 --> 00:18:49.473]  They are completely naive.
[00:18:49.473 --> 00:19:04.721]  And all they've been taught to hate is masculinity, sovereignty, private property, the family, productivity, responsibility, the right to self-defense.
[00:19:04.721 --> 00:19:10.244]  They really believe whatever the mainstream media says.
[00:19:10.244 --> 00:19:11.905]  And they think it's cute.
[00:19:11.905 --> 00:19:12.986]  And they think it's fun.
[00:19:14.042 --> 00:19:18.865]  To have their future destroyed.
[00:19:18.865 --> 00:19:27.129]  They think it's cute to have foreign banks that own insurance companies pass Obamacare for triple prices and to create death panels and to screw them over.
[00:19:27.129 --> 00:19:28.610]  They love it.
[00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.311]  They love being scammed.
[00:19:30.311 --> 00:19:31.691]  They love being took.
[00:19:31.691 --> 00:19:33.552]  They love being abused.
[00:19:33.552 --> 00:19:37.134]  They love being losers.
[00:19:37.134 --> 00:19:42.397]  And they have a savage programmed hatred of anyone that doesn't want to fall with them.
[00:19:45.339 --> 00:19:48.741]  They are delusional.
[00:19:48.741 --> 00:19:51.282]  They are domesticated.
[00:19:51.282 --> 00:19:56.324]  They're spoiled, rotten, scum-filled brats.
[00:19:56.324 --> 00:19:57.065]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:57.065 --> 00:19:57.425]  Stay with us.
[00:19:58.959 --> 00:20:02.283]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[00:20:02.283 --> 00:20:07.769]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[00:20:07.769 --> 00:20:10.052]  But they're about to lose control.
[00:20:10.052 --> 00:20:15.378]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[00:20:15.378 --> 00:20:19.823]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:20:19.943 --> 00:20:22.344]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:20:22.344 --> 00:20:26.184]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:30.705]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[00:20:30.705 --> 00:20:33.826]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:20:33.826 --> 00:20:36.407]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:20:36.407 --> 00:20:38.267]  This will affect us all.
[00:20:38.267 --> 00:20:41.748]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[00:20:42.988 --> 00:20:49.391]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.

[00:22:58.936 --> 00:23:00.777]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[00:23:00.777 --> 00:23:02.538]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?

[00:23:55.787 --> 00:23:56.608]  Come and take it.
[00:24:14.562 --> 00:24:31.046]  You see, the state putting in transvestite or transgender bathrooms in elementary school facilities is about going over the top.
[00:24:31.046 --> 00:24:33.687]  It's about breaking your will.
[00:24:33.687 --> 00:24:37.848]  Telling you that they're going to give you forced inoculations, whether you like it or not, is about breaking your will.
[00:24:39.295 --> 00:24:55.120]  Telling you that you're going to pay a carbon tax on all human activity to private banking consortiums owned by Al Gore, Lord Rothschild, Barack Obama, Hillary and Bill Clinton and others is about being over the top in your face.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:03.342]  Obama going to Africa and telling Africans they can't have cars or air conditioning is about being over the top.
[00:25:03.342 --> 00:25:05.363]  All of this is about being over the top.
[00:25:06.889 --> 00:25:18.013]  And that's what it is when they say Europe will take millions and the United States will take millions of so-called refugees that are really settlers from all over the Middle East and Africa.
[00:25:18.013 --> 00:25:22.855]  Sunni jihadists who try to take over Syria and are now losing.
[00:25:22.855 --> 00:25:25.936]  So they're being given their 40 acres and a mule basically.
[00:25:25.936 --> 00:25:31.738]  They're being given their GI Bill to go and populate Europe.
[00:25:32.606 --> 00:25:48.077]  In giant neighborhoods, in city compound areas, where welfare is paid, where health care is paid, and where Europeans, including the police, dare not even enter.
[00:25:48.077 --> 00:25:52.080]  Now you talk about a plan to take over Europe.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.702]  You talk about a plan to wreck civilization.
[00:25:54.702 --> 00:25:56.523]  This is it.
[00:25:56.523 --> 00:26:00.606]  And it's done by the unmentionably bad scum
[00:26:01.636 --> 00:26:11.218]  Like George Soros, who lives out on a farm on thousands of acres in a giant mansion in Connecticut.
[00:26:11.218 --> 00:26:16.099]  They just have total bad will for the West.
[00:26:16.099 --> 00:26:18.700]  It's a conquering of the West.
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.340]  It's a mutilating of the West.
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:29.182]  And here's French news agency, UN warns Europe against backtracking on migrant communities
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:36.165]  Unestimated 1.1 million migrants have landed in Europe.
[00:26:36.165 --> 00:26:37.346]  And that's a whitewashed number.
[00:26:37.346 --> 00:26:39.128]  It's over 2 million this year.
[00:26:39.128 --> 00:26:40.889]  Other numbers show.
[00:26:40.889 --> 00:26:48.156]  They're almost all men, military age, and man, they don't have a complex that they're asking for something for free.
[00:26:48.156 --> 00:26:50.238]  They're angry.
[00:26:50.238 --> 00:26:56.663]  They hate the West, on average, and they are just filled with abject anger towards Europe.
[00:26:58.592 --> 00:27:02.893]  They've been filled with leftist Ford Foundation style ideology.
[00:27:02.893 --> 00:27:08.594]  So when we come back from break, our reporters are on the ground.
[00:27:08.594 --> 00:27:20.176]  It's an hour and a half from Paris in Brussels, Belgium, the admitted capital of radical Islam, the capital of Jihad, the capital of ISIS in Europe.
[00:27:20.176 --> 00:27:22.417]  And exactly what we'd read in the press is true.
[00:27:24.645 --> 00:27:32.370]  If you're three European men, sure they're from America, but they're European derivation, you do not enter.
[00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:36.052]  You do not come in.
[00:27:36.052 --> 00:27:42.836]  And one of these supposed attackers was reportedly saved out of the Mediterranean Ocean off the coast of Greece.
[00:27:42.836 --> 00:27:44.698]  He was saved by the Greece people.
[00:27:44.698 --> 00:27:46.799]  He was taken in and this is how Europeans are repaid.
[00:27:48.072 --> 00:27:51.734]  And sure, there's the argument, well, we bombed their countries, we did this to them.
[00:27:51.734 --> 00:28:04.181]  Yes, the criminals that are opening our borders and engineering the class of civilizations are the ones that have gone in and toppled any secular government and any government that tried to industrialize and tried to build up those nations.
[00:28:04.181 --> 00:28:14.867]  Whether it was Egypt, whether it was Libya, whether it was Syria, whether it was Iraq, or Iran in 1953 with Mohammed Mosaddegh, you're absolutely right.
[00:28:14.867 --> 00:28:16.628]  But it isn't Europeans that did it.
[00:28:17.776 --> 00:28:23.801]  The same globalists that want us wrecked want them wrecked, and that's the point.
[00:28:23.801 --> 00:28:26.043]  They're going to create a bunch of Islamophobia.
[00:28:26.043 --> 00:28:31.008]  They're going to bomb a bunch of Muslim countries, ones that haven't even been involved in this.
[00:28:31.008 --> 00:28:32.929]  They're going after Assad, who's been fighting it.
[00:28:32.929 --> 00:28:37.113]  Then they're going to turn around.
[00:28:37.113 --> 00:28:39.695]  In our face.
[00:28:39.695 --> 00:28:43.679]  And tell us we have to give up our liberties and our freedoms to counter the threat they helped engineer.
[00:28:45.319 --> 00:28:58.189]  By the way, we have some new big specials that we are running today at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com, and it is your support of the products.

[00:29:19.665 --> 00:29:20.826]  Melatonin and others.
[00:29:20.826 --> 00:29:22.427]  And here's the key.
[00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:26.551]  A bottle of just melatonin with the same dose this has in it is more.
[00:29:26.551 --> 00:29:27.952]  Usually $19.95.
[00:29:27.952 --> 00:29:30.874]  We have it for $16.95 right now.
[00:29:30.874 --> 00:29:38.140]  And it's got eight other ingredients on top of the melatonin that all synergistically work together naturally the way God intended it.
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.721]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:29:39.721 --> 00:29:40.061]  And yes,
[00:29:41.082 --> 00:29:42.304]  It's sold out twice.
[00:29:42.304 --> 00:29:44.787]  It's probably our fastest selling product ever.
[00:29:44.787 --> 00:29:46.690]  The Deep Cleanze is back in stock.
[00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.031]  The truck arrived yesterday.
[00:29:48.031 --> 00:29:49.433]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.433 --> 00:29:51.956]  The Empire's on the run.

[00:29:58.743 --> 00:30:04.767]  Weapons have been reported stolen from a Massachusetts Army Reserve building, reports Fox News.
[00:30:04.767 --> 00:30:11.131]  Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker confirmed the burglary at a Statehouse press conference this past weekend.
[00:30:11.131 --> 00:30:19.416]  State officials have ordered security stepped up at sites around the state after Friday's terror attack in Paris that killed well over 100 people.
[00:30:19.416 --> 00:30:23.119]  It was not immediately clear how many or what type of weapons were taken,
[00:30:23.419 --> 00:30:29.684]  An FBI spokeswoman said that the agency had no indication that the missing weapons were connected to terrorism.
[00:30:29.684 --> 00:30:38.252]  She said, we have entered those weapons into NCIC, a national database, and alerted our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners.
[00:30:38.252 --> 00:30:45.278]  We are collaborating with the Massachusetts State Police, Worcester Police, and others to locate and recover these weapons immediately.
[00:30:46.078 --> 00:30:52.961]  WFXT reported that evidence response resources were at the facility this weekend investigating the break-in.

[00:30:58.706 --> 00:31:02.227]  Infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[00:31:02.227 --> 00:31:07.808]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:31:07.808 --> 00:31:16.170]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:21.832]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[00:31:22.332 --> 00:31:31.398]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:31:31.398 --> 00:31:37.623]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:31:37.623 --> 00:31:44.367]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:31:44.367 --> 00:31:49.431]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:31:49.731 --> 00:31:52.194]  Now available at Infowarslife.com.

[00:31:55.859 --> 00:32:01.927]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:32:01.927 --> 00:32:07.534]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimism.
[00:32:07.534 --> 00:32:08.075]  I don't know.
[00:32:28.228 --> 00:32:29.349]  BrainForce is here.
[00:32:29.349 --> 00:32:31.571]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:32:31.571 --> 00:32:36.555]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:32:36.555 --> 00:32:38.256]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[00:32:38.256 --> 00:32:39.857]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:32:39.857 --> 00:32:43.340]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.302]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:32:45.302 --> 00:32:46.223]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:32:46.223 --> 00:32:47.424]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:32:47.424 --> 00:32:49.425]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[00:33:14.162 --> 00:33:19.147]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:19.147 --> 00:33:31.979]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.979 --> 00:33:37.325]  If you ever wanted to see how
[00:33:38.829 --> 00:33:41.310]  World War 4 would be fought, this is it.
[00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:59.879]  It's fought economically, it's fought with giant migrant waves, it's fought with drug-resistant diseases, it's fought with cultural destruction, it's caught, it's fought with incredible propaganda.
[00:33:59.879 --> 00:34:05.522]  And we're going to fight it by exposing the larger, deeper agenda.
[00:34:08.424 --> 00:34:20.218]  The globalists know how to manipulate evil, they know how to manipulate crises, they know how to play both sides of a problem, and out of it come out on top.
[00:34:20.218 --> 00:34:28.207]  And when you understand that chaos is their brand, when you understand that crisis is their brand, when you understand that
[00:34:29.096 --> 00:34:32.238]  This is a dark logic that we're facing.
[00:34:32.238 --> 00:34:36.660]  Then the keys become evident to overturn it and overthrow it.
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:43.964]  But only when the public understands the endgame and the larger program.
[00:34:43.964 --> 00:34:56.912]  Joe Biggs, Paul Joseph Watson, and Michael Zimmerman, Infowars.com reporters, are all on the ground, not in Paris as they were the last two days, but now across the border to the north.
[00:34:58.067 --> 00:35:00.988]  In Brussels, Belgium.
[00:35:00.988 --> 00:35:05.750]  Now Brussels, Belgium is the admitted capital of ISIS in Europe.
[00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:09.351]  It is the admitted capital of Jihad in Europe.
[00:35:09.351 --> 00:35:19.235]  It is the admitted place where the reported terrorists organized and launched their attacks that we saw on Friday the 13th.
[00:35:19.235 --> 00:35:21.116]  Large areas of Brussels
[00:35:23.251 --> 00:35:26.533]  are off limits to Europeans.
[00:35:26.533 --> 00:35:29.174]  The police will not even enter it.
[00:35:29.174 --> 00:35:44.242]  Only the socialist social workers arrive with the free welfare, the free health care, and they tend, like mother, mother hens, they tend the eggs lovingly.
[00:35:44.242 --> 00:35:52.587]  And the national leaders bring in the record numbers of Islamists to swell the ranks full of Western anti-Christian hatred.
[00:35:54.306 --> 00:36:02.730]  Forging the sword that the communists and the socialists will use to finally decapitate Europe.
[00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:11.755]  So this is a match made in hell with a vandalistic lust, a piratical lust.
[00:36:12.728 --> 00:36:13.669]  To conquer Europe.
[00:36:13.669 --> 00:36:16.732]  They know nationalist parties are taking over.
[00:36:16.732 --> 00:36:19.115]  They know common sense is kicking back in.
[00:36:19.115 --> 00:36:25.502]  They know libertarian ideas are growing in popularity under the UKIP party and others.
[00:36:25.502 --> 00:36:31.068]  Just mainline libertarian, common sense, nationalistic groups.
[00:36:31.068 --> 00:36:31.748]  You've heard them on.
[00:36:32.725 --> 00:36:36.627]  Total common sense, but the media calls him super right-wing extremist.
[00:36:36.627 --> 00:36:50.795]  Well, the public's turning against that, so there's a move to fully break the countries, open the borders, and ban demonstrations in Sweden, in Belgium, in France, in Germany, against the open borders.
[00:36:52.745 --> 00:37:00.690]  And now France is announcing basically martial law, civil emergency, 5,000 troops patrolling with machine guns on the streets of Paris.
[00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:03.713]  Our reporters are going to be covering that tomorrow as well.
[00:37:03.713 --> 00:37:14.400]  But this is the beginning of the accelerated flood into Western nations.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:21.665]  And we will see if they can use the controlled corporate press to spin this and force us to not just put up with groups
[00:37:23.868 --> 00:37:28.111]  That are absolutely incompatible with a free society.
[00:37:28.111 --> 00:37:33.374]  But we're going to see if they're going to make us pay for it all, which they're already doing.
[00:37:33.374 --> 00:37:40.038]  France has launched airstrikes against Islamic State stronghold in Syria.
[00:37:40.038 --> 00:37:43.861]  Funny, a couple years ago you put this very group in charge there to murder everybody.
[00:37:43.861 --> 00:37:47.703]  Shame groups you brought in to attack your own people.
[00:37:47.703 --> 00:37:49.344]  We're going to decipher exactly what's happening.
[00:37:49.344 --> 00:37:49.925]  Joe Biggs
[00:37:51.653 --> 00:37:51.813]  Joe
[00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:13.864]  Exactly, that is completely correct, Alex.
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:42.262]  Just moments ago, we were in Molenbeek, Belgium, which is about a 40-minute walk outside of Brussels.
[00:38:42.262 --> 00:38:54.928]  And in that area, we went to the location of where the Belgian Special Forces conducted a raid, and they actually got the mastermind of the Paris attack to happen on Friday the 13th.
[00:38:54.928 --> 00:39:01.031]  And we were in that area doing some reports, and as we decided to leave because of the rain, we were followed by cars.
[00:39:01.031 --> 00:39:04.353]  We had a car with three younger males, probably ages 20 to 25.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:11.744]  Screaming.
[00:39:11.744 --> 00:39:14.146]  Joe Big's Skype is breaking up.
[00:39:14.146 --> 00:39:14.606]  Stop Joe.
[00:39:14.606 --> 00:39:15.767]  I want you to start back over again.
[00:39:15.767 --> 00:39:18.669]  Reporting from Belgium right now.
[00:39:18.669 --> 00:39:20.731]  Outside France about an hour and a half from Paris.
[00:39:20.731 --> 00:39:21.471]  Your Skype's back.
[00:39:21.471 --> 00:39:22.012]  Please continue.
[00:39:23.632 --> 00:39:39.466]  Yeah, so we walked away from where the raid happened after we did two or three reports and we started trying to get out of the rain so we were going to walk into a business and as we walked in there was a whole bunch of Muslim men and basically we were told, hey, you're not welcome here, get the hell out of here.
[00:39:39.466 --> 00:39:40.527]  Was this a restaurant?
[00:39:40.527 --> 00:39:41.908]  A store?
[00:39:41.908 --> 00:39:42.849]  It was like a restaurant, yes.
[00:39:42.849 --> 00:39:45.912]  That's what you told me earlier, I just wanted to make that clear.
[00:39:45.912 --> 00:39:49.515]  Yeah, definitely our white privilege didn't come into account in that situation.
[00:39:50.202 --> 00:39:51.147]  Talk about the car.
[00:39:51.147 --> 00:39:54.041]  You cut out talking about the car with the three military-age men.
[00:39:55.305 --> 00:39:57.067]  Yeah, so there was a car that kept following us.
[00:39:57.067 --> 00:40:01.451]  It would pull up and stop and park as we would stop and talk and stay behind us.
[00:40:01.451 --> 00:40:07.096]  And as we would walk, it would move with us and then eventually drove past and they started screaming, get out of here, go away.
[00:40:07.096 --> 00:40:10.359]  Then they circled back around and then two more cars came out.
[00:40:10.359 --> 00:40:13.822]  One of them broke away and went down a side alley where they could watch us as we walk.
[00:40:13.822 --> 00:40:15.864]  And the other guy followed behind for a while.
[00:40:15.864 --> 00:40:20.048]  There was three younger men, probably ages 20 to 25, and they were just staring at us.
[00:40:20.048 --> 00:40:21.029]  They had their cell phones out.
[00:40:21.926 --> 00:40:22.106]  I don't
[00:40:46.215 --> 00:40:47.237]  Multiple terrorist attacks
[00:41:01.548 --> 00:41:01.909]  I don't know.
[00:41:21.684 --> 00:41:23.005]  Well Joe, you've done a great job.
[00:41:23.005 --> 00:41:27.549]  I didn't think to tell you guys to take some of the body cams we have with you.
[00:41:27.549 --> 00:41:34.716]  So when you get back into Paris or Brussels or wherever, go to one of their nicer camera shops and get some body cams.
[00:41:34.716 --> 00:41:41.101]  That way you can just activate them whenever you're surrounded by these people and catch it all on tape.
[00:41:41.101 --> 00:41:45.565]  I imagine that I would have been caught unaware as well whenever this happened, but
[00:41:46.431 --> 00:41:50.796]  This really shows how loving and sweet these people are.
[00:41:50.796 --> 00:41:54.720]  I think we should bring a hundred million folks in.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.400]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.202]  And that's what people aren't really thinking about.
[00:41:57.202 --> 00:41:59.465]  They're not looking at it from the common sense side.
[00:41:59.465 --> 00:42:02.167]  As in, you know, yeah, there are some good people that are trying to come over there.
[00:42:02.167 --> 00:42:03.789]  They're trying to escape what's going on.
[00:42:03.789 --> 00:42:04.470]  But in that mix,
[00:42:05.074 --> 00:42:09.999]  Are people hidden, intending to do harm on civilians across the country?
[00:42:09.999 --> 00:42:14.864]  I mean, you have ISIS coming out and releasing a video saying that D.C.
[00:42:14.864 --> 00:42:16.426]  is going to be their next target.
[00:42:16.426 --> 00:42:26.276]  Well, if you actually go on the map and look at Berkeley, Virginia, Berkeley, Virginia is one of the most highly populated areas by Muslims, and ISIS also released a kill list
[00:42:26.956 --> 00:42:32.920]  Uh, naming seven different cities in Texas and one in Virginia and that one being Burke right outside of Washington DC.
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:36.383]  It's about south southwest a little ways from Washington.
[00:42:36.383 --> 00:42:38.784]  So it's definitely a lot of stuff heating up right now.
[00:42:38.784 --> 00:42:43.568]  People need to remain vigilant and we've got to do what we can to expose what's going on so we can show
[00:42:44.574 --> 00:42:50.719]  Why these open borders are a bad idea, why we need to shut it down, why we need more people coming out and speaking against it.
[00:42:50.719 --> 00:42:56.324]  You know, we have multiple governors across the country who have said, we're not going to take in these Syrian refugees.
[00:42:56.324 --> 00:43:06.533]  But then you have the State Department today releasing a statement saying, hey, at the end of the day, you might have to do it regardless of the fact of what each state wants to do, what the governors intend on doing.
[00:43:09.454 --> 00:43:26.192]  Taking what you learned in Afghanistan and Iraq, seeing what you've witnessed unfolding in Syria and other countries with Western governments openly backing these groups to come in and just murder other Muslims, murder Christians, blow up any religious sites they find.
[00:43:26.192 --> 00:43:29.875]  We know these are mainly radical Sunnis that are coming into Europe.
[00:43:29.875 --> 00:43:31.617]  That's why they're recruiting in these neighborhoods.
[00:43:32.742 --> 00:43:37.805]  What do you think the endgame is of the European leaders pulling something like this?
[00:43:37.805 --> 00:43:39.826]  I mean, we know it's Balkanization.
[00:43:39.826 --> 00:43:42.667]  We know they're going to use the threat to take more freedom.
[00:43:42.667 --> 00:43:47.430]  But how do they think they're going to get away with this long-term suiciding Europe?
[00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:51.392]  Because the death throes of Europe will end up bringing down these globalist traitors.
[00:43:55.404 --> 00:43:56.005]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:56.005 --> 00:43:58.607]  I mean, eventually it's just going to bust into all that war.
[00:43:58.607 --> 00:44:03.611]  It seems like that kind of is what a lot of the world leaders want to happen as a World War III.
[00:44:03.611 --> 00:44:08.896]  I mean, the military-industrial complex is one of the largest ways that these corporations and these banks make money.
[00:44:08.896 --> 00:44:13.960]  So it makes complete and total sense that they're trying to poke the bear to get something like that to happen.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.582]  I mean, you have the French bombing now, you have the U.S.
[00:44:16.582 --> 00:44:20.546]  Air Force helping out, writing messages on their missiles saying, from Paris, with love.
[00:44:20.993 --> 00:44:21.914]  No, that's what they want.
[00:44:21.914 --> 00:44:23.676]  They want everyone to live in a state of fear.
[00:44:23.676 --> 00:44:29.541]  They want to go in, take out the Assad regime, put in their own Western puppet, and take control of that area.
[00:44:29.541 --> 00:44:35.747]  So eventually they can move over, possibly start placing troops in Syria, and then eventually go into Iran.
[00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:48.094]  It really is a purely Machiavellian worldview, where our governments engage the most evil things you can imagine, but claim it's for the greater good, but then there isn't even a greater good.
[00:44:48.094 --> 00:44:58.080]  It's just completely cold-blooded to de-industrialize and break up every country on Earth, including the West, and the third world is sold on all this
[00:44:59.167 --> 00:45:16.704]  Class envy, class warfare stuff, with carbon taxes, and then we actually get the global treaty copy five years ago, there in Copenhagen, Denmark, when they were having their world summit, and it basically doubled the taxes on the third world than what it would do to the first world.
[00:45:16.704 --> 00:45:20.207]  So, it is a ultra-massive screw job.
[00:45:20.207 --> 00:45:21.929]  Joe Biggs, you've got the floor to give us your views.
[00:45:22.998 --> 00:45:34.047]  Well, we were just, right before we left Paris, we were at the train station, and they actually have an iceberg blow-up thing that has police and security guarding it, and it is for global warming.
[00:45:34.047 --> 00:45:36.809]  It's to represent global warming and the conference that's coming up.
[00:45:36.809 --> 00:45:44.675]  I thought that was extremely interesting that they had that out there, and they were kind of pushing that right there at the train station where there's a lot of tourism.
[00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:49.879]  I actually have the pictures up and a link to the site of the train station on my Twitter.
[00:45:49.879 --> 00:45:52.321]  If you guys want to pull it up, you can find it and you can see that.
[00:45:52.321 --> 00:45:52.741]  But they had
[00:45:53.513 --> 00:45:55.054]  I want to come back to you.
[00:46:07.202 --> 00:46:10.784]  In a few minutes, but I want to go ahead and switch out with Paul Watson right now.
[00:46:10.784 --> 00:46:11.724]  OK.
[00:46:11.724 --> 00:46:18.668]  And get his breakdown of this situation.
[00:46:18.668 --> 00:46:20.769]  It's very, very important.
[00:46:20.769 --> 00:46:25.771]  On top of all the craziness, I've got Charlie Sheen right here texting me.
[00:46:25.771 --> 00:46:28.193]  So I've got to handle that here for a moment.
[00:46:28.193 --> 00:46:33.315]  Well, that firestorm going on right now, we pray for him, obviously.
[00:46:33.315 --> 00:46:35.316]  But there is just a lot going on here.
[00:46:36.957 --> 00:46:44.661]  I want to have Paul Watson come in right now and give us his breakdown of the situation we're witnessing.
[00:46:44.661 --> 00:46:53.425]  You know, for me, Paul Watson, this is so surreal, and now we're reconnecting with Paul, the Skype cut out.
[00:46:53.425 --> 00:47:04.190]  This is so surreal for me personally to be sitting here watching Europe suicide itself
[00:47:05.606 --> 00:47:10.428]  But watching the globalists suicide the Middle East as well.
[00:47:10.428 --> 00:47:19.671]  And watching our governments over and over again support the bad guys because they don't want these countries to ever get on their feet.
[00:47:19.671 --> 00:47:29.295]  I mean, Hillary has apologized for supposedly wrecking Libya.
[00:47:29.295 --> 00:47:31.055]  Well, why did she get in trouble?
[00:47:31.055 --> 00:47:32.216]  They did it on purpose!
[00:47:32.216 --> 00:47:34.877]  They wanted to wreck Libya because it was building up Africa.
[00:47:36.963 --> 00:47:48.102]  It was creating a African bank system that was actually producing dams and bridges and infrastructure and electrical power.
[00:47:48.102 --> 00:47:49.345]  And they just blew Libya up.
[00:47:51.547 --> 00:47:55.990]  I'm going to skip this network break and go all the way to 59 after.
[00:47:55.990 --> 00:48:00.773]  Paul Watson, I'm going to give you the floor here to really break down your observations.
[00:48:00.773 --> 00:48:01.974]  First, what you saw today.
[00:48:01.974 --> 00:48:06.237]  I appreciate you and the courage of you and Biggs and Zimmerman.
[00:48:06.237 --> 00:48:12.101]  And then walk through other things you've witnessed since you were on with us 23 hours ago yesterday.
[00:48:18.044 --> 00:48:24.166]  Well, yeah, obviously, as Big said, today we visited Molenbeek, which is known as the jihadist capital of Europe.
[00:48:24.166 --> 00:48:28.567]  It's one of these Muslim no-go ghettos that the left pretends doesn't exist.
[00:48:28.567 --> 00:48:39.651]  Remember, Steve Emerson went on Fox News after Charlie Hebdo and blamed some of these radicalised no-go Muslim ghettos for recruiting some of the attackers involved in that incident.
[00:48:39.651 --> 00:48:40.931]  The left laughed him off.
[00:48:40.931 --> 00:48:43.932]  The mayor of Paris tried to sue Fox News for those comments.
[00:48:44.332 --> 00:48:48.954]  And they basically, for the next 10 months, pretended that these areas don't exist.
[00:48:48.954 --> 00:48:49.775]  They do exist.
[00:48:49.775 --> 00:48:51.075]  We've just been in one.
[00:48:51.075 --> 00:48:54.737]  And, again, they've earned the reputation for being a no-go zone.
[00:48:54.737 --> 00:49:00.360]  Because, as Big said, we were, you know, flipped the bird, screamed at by these young Muslims in this car.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.340]  They followed us.
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:05.442]  Then we went to try and get something in a bar kind of restaurant place.
[00:49:06.102 --> 00:49:08.323]  And from what I could tell, the guy was talking French.
[00:49:08.323 --> 00:49:12.985]  He was basically saying white people aren't allowed in restaurants in this area.
[00:49:12.985 --> 00:49:16.647]  So our white privilege didn't count for much.
[00:49:16.647 --> 00:49:19.828]  But I'm racist for criticizing the religion of Islam.
[00:49:19.828 --> 00:49:24.130]  But they've got segregation in these Muslim no-go ghettos.
[00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:25.831]  So yes, they do exist.
[00:49:25.831 --> 00:49:27.032]  We've been in one.
[00:49:27.032 --> 00:49:31.794]  And as Vic said, this was where the guy, the eighth attacker, who is still on the loose in
[00:49:31.854 --> 00:49:32.155]  We're good.
[00:49:43.542 --> 00:49:45.283]  Well, where this raid occurred.
[00:49:45.283 --> 00:49:47.024]  There are no police there whatsoever.
[00:49:47.024 --> 00:49:48.745]  We didn't see one police officer.
[00:49:48.745 --> 00:49:50.445]  Maybe there was a van driving through once.
[00:49:50.445 --> 00:49:52.486]  Other than that, absolutely nothing.
[00:49:52.486 --> 00:49:56.588]  So, they don't want to patrol these areas because they're not welcome.
[00:49:56.588 --> 00:49:59.029]  And obviously, anybody white is not welcome.
[00:49:59.029 --> 00:50:02.651]  And that was made clear to us, so we had to get out of there.
[00:50:02.651 --> 00:50:03.792]  But that's Molenbeek.
[00:50:03.792 --> 00:50:09.975]  That's the jihadist capital of Europe.
[00:50:09.975 --> 00:50:10.375]  And of course,
[00:50:11.266 --> 00:50:15.689]  It's not just the Paris attack in which, you know, the jihadists came out of that area.
[00:50:15.689 --> 00:50:22.755]  The Thais train attack back in August, of course you remember it was derailed by the US military service personnel.
[00:50:22.755 --> 00:50:25.557]  He came from Molenbeek, Belgium.
[00:50:25.557 --> 00:50:28.680]  The Jewish museum bomber here in Brussels.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:32.923]  Last year he opened fire with a Kalashnikov rifle again, like the train bomb, like the train attacker.
[00:50:34.133 --> 00:50:36.014]  He lived in Molenbeek.
[00:50:36.014 --> 00:50:37.215]  That's why they all come from me.
[00:50:37.215 --> 00:50:43.057]  Of course, Belgium has the highest proportion of jihadists being sent to Syria out of the whole of Europe.
[00:50:43.057 --> 00:50:56.143]  And if you look on Twitter, on my Twitter account today, I posted the fact that the most number of pro-ISIS tweets expressing sympathy towards ISIS, number three on that list is Belgium.
[00:50:56.143 --> 00:50:59.985]  Way above the likes of Turkey, way above the likes of Saudi Arabia.
[00:50:59.985 --> 00:51:01.706]  So there's a huge pro-ISIS
[00:51:04.753 --> 00:51:05.593]  We're good to go.
[00:51:28.405 --> 00:51:33.007]  So this is an area with 30-40% unemployment rate.
[00:51:33.007 --> 00:51:37.749]  They call it the capital of political Islam in continental Europe.
[00:51:37.749 --> 00:51:40.830]  That's according to Belgium's Interior Minister.
[00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:51.015]  And what's interesting is that even though Belgium is quite a left-wing country, obviously quite tolerant of intolerance, the Belgian Prime Minister came out yesterday and said
[00:51:52.074 --> 00:51:57.822]  Almost every time an Islamic terrorist atrocity occurs, there is a link with Molenbeek.
[00:51:57.822 --> 00:52:03.029]  He went on to say, we have tried prevention, now we will have to get repressive.
[00:52:03.029 --> 00:52:04.832]  That was his word, repressive.
[00:52:04.832 --> 00:52:07.636]  It has been a form of laissez-faire and laxity.
[00:52:07.636 --> 00:52:08.998]  Now we are paying the bill.
[00:52:09.693 --> 00:52:14.935]  Of course, the eighth suspect in the Paris attacks is still on the loose here in Belgium.
[00:52:14.935 --> 00:52:22.239]  They went and raided his apartment, arrested a couple of his brothers, I believe, who were subsequently released, but he's still on the loose.
[00:52:22.239 --> 00:52:30.922]  And now the Prime Minister of Belgium is saying they need to get repressive in the area of Molenbeek to clamp down on that jihadist sentiment.
[00:52:38.792 --> 00:52:49.340]  Folks, look, as the mayor started off expressing our solidarity with the people of France, the people of Paris.
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:53:03.090]  Our hearts do go out to them and to Nohemi Gonzalez's family here in Southern California, and all those families who lost loved ones.
[00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:06.973]  This is all done to do one thing.
[00:53:08.138 --> 00:53:12.403]  Terror is designed to inspire terror.
[00:53:12.403 --> 00:53:19.130]  And we lose, they win, the moment we give in to that terror.
[00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:25.357]  The moment we give in and change anything about the openness of our society is the moment they win.
[00:53:26.989 --> 00:53:28.950]  And we cannot let that happen.
[00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:39.515]  There will be a tendency, both here and in Europe, to call for closing borders, call for closing down access to information, etc.
[00:53:39.515 --> 00:53:40.896]  But that's all this is about.
[00:53:40.896 --> 00:53:44.637]  That's what they're attempting to do.
[00:53:44.637 --> 00:53:46.999]  That's the ultimate victory.
[00:53:46.999 --> 00:53:49.000]  We didn't do it after 9-11.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.281]  We didn't do it after the Boston Marathon.
[00:53:52.281 --> 00:53:53.702]  We've never done it.
[00:53:53.702 --> 00:53:56.143]  Every other occasion that's occurred.
[00:53:57.026 --> 00:54:00.990]  And it is not sustainable, and we will succeed.
[00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:14.484]  And I say to the American people, there is no existential threat to the United States in the sense that nothing, nothing ISIS can do can threaten to bring down a government, can threaten to fundamentally alter the way we live.
[00:54:14.484 --> 00:54:19.449]  It can be what it is, acts of terror to try to get us to do that voluntarily.
[00:54:20.282 --> 00:54:29.410]  Alright, let's stop right there because as Paul Watson's Skype broke up in Brussels, Belgium, just an hour and a half from Paris, as they're tracking back to the source of the terror, what a profound clip.
[00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:31.952]  In fact, you could write a book about that clip.
[00:54:31.952 --> 00:54:37.157]  We could play that clip 50 times today and not analyze it fully or properly.
[00:54:39.079 --> 00:54:42.440]  9-11 clearly has staged with Saudi Arabia with criminals in our government.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:43.660]  That's now come out.
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:52.342]  We've been proven correct to take our liberties, launch wars against countries like Iraq that did nothing to us, for Saudi Arabia.
[00:54:52.342 --> 00:55:02.243]  And then on top of this, Paul, he then gets up and says the terrorists can't fundamentally alter anything in our lives.
[00:55:02.243 --> 00:55:02.964]  Which is true!
[00:55:02.964 --> 00:55:05.064]  We shouldn't give in to terrorists, whether they're real or not.
[00:55:06.863 --> 00:55:13.385]  And basically says giving up our liberty won't protect us, but they've already taken so many of our liberties.
[00:55:13.385 --> 00:55:18.986]  So here is the Vice President admitting that terrorists can't defeat us or can't take us down.
[00:55:18.986 --> 00:55:22.207]  Statistically, it's very rare to get killed by terrorists.
[00:55:22.207 --> 00:55:23.308]  But they hype it up.
[00:55:23.308 --> 00:55:25.448]  Both parties have taken our freedoms.
[00:55:25.448 --> 00:55:27.929]  They're expanding it.
[00:55:27.929 --> 00:55:31.190]  But he sells freedom as if we keep our borders open.
[00:55:32.264 --> 00:55:41.289]  That's the one thing, see, we have no freedom but the freedom to keep our borders open and the freedom to pay for the illegal aliens, health care and everything else.
[00:55:41.289 --> 00:55:42.230]  That's it.
[00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:43.031]  That's what he's saying.
[00:55:43.031 --> 00:55:50.055]  So he speaks the language of freedom, rhetorically, but in reality it's totally empty and they're doing the opposite.
[00:55:50.055 --> 00:55:52.256]  I mean, what an incredible statement.
[00:55:52.256 --> 00:55:54.117]  Could you hear that in Belgium?
[00:55:54.117 --> 00:55:58.440]  Paul Joseph Watson, that Biden clip from this morning, where he comes out and
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:02.621]  Says that we've got to stay free, we've got to keep our borders open?
[00:56:02.621 --> 00:56:05.863]  No, we're free in the country, but we have borders.
[00:56:05.863 --> 00:56:07.463]  That's what a sovereign country does.
[00:56:07.463 --> 00:56:09.844]  It's why my body has skin.
[00:56:09.844 --> 00:56:13.426]  It's why I have a mucous membrane in my mouth.
[00:56:13.426 --> 00:56:15.066]  I have a border for a reason.
[00:56:15.066 --> 00:56:18.748]  My cells have a barrier.
[00:56:18.748 --> 00:56:20.488]  Plants have a wall.
[00:56:20.488 --> 00:56:24.950]  Not because they're racist, but because they'd die if they didn't, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:56:26.775 --> 00:56:31.197]  Yeah, and of course, that echoes what Salon.com said the other day, which I talked about.
[00:56:31.197 --> 00:56:37.880]  They basically came out with a headline saying the answer to the Paris terror attacks is to invite more Muslim refugees into Paris.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.842]  Again, absolutely ludicrous, makes no sense.
[00:56:40.842 --> 00:56:48.485]  And today, which you probably mentioned, there's a report out of Baton Rouge that they allowed some of these Syrian refugees into Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
[00:56:48.485 --> 00:56:51.367]  One of them's already escaped, missing completely.
[00:56:51.367 --> 00:56:52.807]  They don't know where he's gone.
[00:56:52.807 --> 00:56:53.908]  Echoing similar
[00:56:59.912 --> 00:57:02.619]  You know, Skype is a great problem.
[00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:04.103]  Sometimes it works great, sometimes it doesn't.
[00:57:04.103 --> 00:57:05.828]  But it's a great technology.
[00:57:05.828 --> 00:57:06.971]  And Paul Watson is back.
[00:57:06.971 --> 00:57:07.452]  Finish your point?
[00:57:08.993 --> 00:57:10.114]  Yeah, it's the same in Germany.
[00:57:10.114 --> 00:57:15.778]  They're getting to these refugee registration centers and then just disappearing into the underground.
[00:57:15.778 --> 00:57:23.323]  So, of course, ISIS again came out with a promise the other day and said they would infiltrate 4,000 jihadists through this refugee wave.
[00:57:23.323 --> 00:57:31.789]  And by the way, Paul, they've been keeping their promises and now they're disappearing from refugee centers inside the United States.
[00:57:31.789 --> 00:57:32.610]  Yeah, that's what I was saying.
[00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:36.032]  Baton Rouge, one's gone missing already, the first wave that they took in.
[00:57:36.690 --> 00:57:44.699]  And of course that's only going to happen to a greater extent, so... The reaction in Paris though seems to be they're not really letting it affect their way of life.
[00:57:44.699 --> 00:57:46.521]  I mean, it was quite deserted on Sunday, but...
[00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.390]  Okay.
[00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:17.517]  We're good.
[00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:20.252]  Paul, this is sensational, and people need to see it.
[00:58:20.252 --> 00:58:21.813]  I don't want to put you in harm's way.
[00:58:21.813 --> 00:58:22.633]  It's your decision.
[00:58:22.633 --> 00:58:32.280]  But rent a car, rent a guide, do whatever you gotta do, if it's your choice, get in there, get footage of these people, show them running folks off.
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:34.701]  It's important to show these no-go areas.
[00:58:34.701 --> 00:58:40.505]  It's important to show ISIS capital inside Europe, as mainstream media calls it, when we need the footage.
[00:58:40.505 --> 00:58:42.987]  This is like a vice report or something.
[00:58:42.987 --> 00:58:44.088]  People need to see this.
[00:58:44.088 --> 00:58:46.409]  Great job having the idea to go there.
[00:58:46.409 --> 00:58:47.110]  We'll be back.
[00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:47.630]  Paul, stay there.

[01:00:12.637 --> 01:00:16.840]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:20.882]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.379 --> 01:00:33.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot make this up.
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:37.722]  Headlines on InfoWars.com with multiple links to all of it.
[01:00:37.722 --> 01:00:38.783]  Get Daniel's article.
[01:00:38.783 --> 01:00:40.763]  Leftist media, you're racist.
[01:00:40.763 --> 01:00:43.465]  Give your support Paris victims.
[01:00:43.465 --> 01:00:53.269]  And see, folks couldn't come out and say Black Lives Matter was wrong to basically say, hey, these are white people, these are bad people, you know, don't, don't, don't cry for them.
[01:00:55.236 --> 01:01:00.580]  And the left couldn't say that Black Lives Matter was wrong, so they've now come out and doubled down.
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:09.066]  The independents and others have come out and said that you are racist.
[01:01:09.066 --> 01:01:16.472]  So see, there's an extremism in these people where they've always got to go further than the next.
[01:01:16.472 --> 01:01:22.437]  And that's what makes them so bizarre-looking and behaving to anyone who's not a psychotic.
[01:01:23.288 --> 01:01:27.818]  But I tell you, Paul Watson, is leftist hysteria peaking?
[01:01:27.818 --> 01:01:32.609]  Or are we only seeing a new height in their bizarre behaviors?
[01:01:35.205 --> 01:01:40.308]  I think there's such a massive backlash against it that it is starting to peak now and we're going to see it collapse.
[01:01:40.308 --> 01:01:46.352]  I mean, the death of political correctness has been heralded by many pundits who have been covering this for years.
[01:01:46.352 --> 01:01:58.759]  But as you just mentioned, The Independent came out with an article and basically said, if you change your Facebook profile picture or your Twitter profile picture to an image of the French flag in solidarity with the victims, as millions and millions of people have done,
[01:01:59.491 --> 01:02:06.039]  You know, that could be taken as kind of lazy virtue signaling, but if you're just doing it to express sympathy with the victims, what's the big deal?
[01:02:06.039 --> 01:02:10.885]  The Independent came out and said, if you do that, then you're exercising white supremacy.
[01:02:10.885 --> 01:02:11.406]  They actually said that.
[01:02:11.406 --> 01:02:15.070]  Yeah, that's what we're talking about in this article.
[01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:16.532]  What is wrong with these people?
[01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:17.673]  Why do they hate
[01:02:18.851 --> 01:02:20.473]  Because I don't like white supremacist groups.
[01:02:20.473 --> 01:02:24.716]  I find them as upsetting and stupid as the black supremacist groups or whatever.
[01:02:24.716 --> 01:02:29.261]  But at the same time, they don't get endorsement by CNN, MSNBC, and the White House.
[01:02:29.261 --> 01:02:32.323]  I mean, this anti-white movement is real.
[01:02:32.323 --> 01:02:34.345]  It's global and it's insane.
[01:02:34.345 --> 01:02:40.331]  Don't all these minorities that have come to Europe understand that if the radical jihadis get in, they're going to murder them?
[01:02:42.273 --> 01:02:51.440]  Well yeah, of course the vast majority of victims of Islamic terror are other Muslims, but that's the point that Ayaan Hirsi Ali and a lot of these other commentators have made.
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:55.504]  There's no strong voice within moderate Islam to condemn radical Islam.
[01:02:55.504 --> 01:03:00.668]  And then if you go drill down into the tenets of Islam itself, you know, it's not being misinterpreted.
[01:03:00.668 --> 01:03:04.611]  If you take it literally, then it's being directly interpreted from the Quran.
[01:03:04.611 --> 01:03:07.914]  So there aren't enough moderate voices within Islam to speak out against that.
[01:03:07.914 --> 01:03:11.697]  Then you get people like the Grand Mufti in Australia who came out and said,
[01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:17.040]  Basically, terrorism is caused by racism and Islamophobia.
[01:03:17.742 --> 01:03:24.267]  So again, it's Islamophobic to draw attention to the fact that there are problems within the religion of Islam and the Qur'an.
[01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:27.109]  That's racist, even though Islam is not a race.
[01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:34.454]  But you can go into an area like Molumby, get refused service in a restaurant, segregation, and you're still the racist.
[01:03:34.454 --> 01:03:36.055]  You're still the white supremacist.
[01:03:36.055 --> 01:03:37.937]  You know, I've got an idea.
[01:03:37.937 --> 01:03:43.400]  How about you go to the local police station and file a discrimination claim against that business?
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:43.861]  I'm serious.
[01:03:43.861 --> 01:03:46.403]  I want to go get video of the front of it, then get out of there.
[01:03:47.352 --> 01:03:50.460]  And then I, you know, tomorrow, whenever, and then I want to go to the police department.
[01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:51.643]  I want to file a report.
[01:03:51.643 --> 01:03:52.164]  I'm serious.
[01:03:52.164 --> 01:03:53.547]  This is news.
[01:03:53.547 --> 01:03:55.913]  And I bet you can go to other places and you're not going to get service.
[01:03:57.813 --> 01:03:59.713]  Yeah, because it's a no-go area.
[01:03:59.713 --> 01:04:01.734]  There's no tolerance there.
[01:04:01.734 --> 01:04:05.395]  That's what the left always preaches, and yet there's no tolerance of any outsiders.
[01:04:05.395 --> 01:04:13.716]  And it's funny, because I read articles today from other journalists who were there, when the police were there, just after the raid was going on, when there were more journalists there.
[01:04:13.716 --> 01:04:15.617]  And they were saying, oh, these people are really friendly.
[01:04:15.617 --> 01:04:18.297]  They've kind of got a bit of a bad rep.
[01:04:18.297 --> 01:04:20.038]  Now there are no police there.
[01:04:20.038 --> 01:04:21.098]  It's gone back to normal.
[01:04:21.098 --> 01:04:22.118]  It's straight back to normal.
[01:04:22.118 --> 01:04:25.759]  So yeah, I want to keep my head attached to my body.
[01:04:25.759 --> 01:04:26.879]  That's why I don't want to go back there.
[01:04:28.592 --> 01:04:31.913]  Are you going back, Paul?
[01:04:31.913 --> 01:04:35.134]  No.
[01:04:35.134 --> 01:04:37.275]  We've got some good video out there, though.
[01:04:37.275 --> 01:04:42.616]  Well, listen, what I'm saying is, and we'll plan it later, obviously, but you need to get a guide, get a car.
[01:04:42.616 --> 01:04:45.177]  I want shots, cinematic shots up and down the street.
[01:04:45.177 --> 01:04:45.757]  Show it.
[01:04:45.757 --> 01:04:47.698]  Don't go to that exact location, but others.
[01:04:47.698 --> 01:04:48.638]  Because this is big.
[01:04:48.638 --> 01:04:51.019]  This needs to be shown, Watson.
[01:04:51.019 --> 01:04:54.540]  Watson, I'm sending you back.
[01:04:56.611 --> 01:04:58.811]  Oh, we got a bunch of guests coming up.
[01:04:58.811 --> 01:05:06.093]  A man has filed a lawsuit against his landlord over the right to have a firearm in his apartment, reports guns.com.
[01:05:06.093 --> 01:05:11.774]  Harvey Limbo's apartment was targeted a total of five times before he purchased a handgun.
[01:05:11.774 --> 01:05:19.956]  Limbo, who suffers from diabetes, degenerative heart disease, and chronic pain, believes burglars targeted his home searching for prescription pills.
[01:05:19.956 --> 01:05:25.377]  At less than 12 hours after he purchased his gun, he was met face-to-face with one of those burglars.
[01:05:25.777 --> 01:05:34.663]  Limbo was sleeping with his newly purchased gun under his pillow and was awakened around midnight and saw a shadowy figure pass from the kitchen into the living room.
[01:05:34.663 --> 01:05:42.128]  The thief was found sifting through prescription pills, so Limbo trained his gun on the intruder and warned him not to move as he called 911.
[01:05:42.128 --> 01:05:45.070]  The thief did move, however, and was shot in the shoulder.
[01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:52.175]  Days later, Limbo was contacted by Stanford Management Company with a reminder that he agreed not to have a firearm in his home.
[01:05:52.175 --> 01:05:55.617]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com

[01:08:01.393 --> 01:08:08.017]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.017 --> 01:08:11.019]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:29.662 --> 01:08:42.290]  Filmmaker Joel Gilbert is going to be joining us to parallel some of the incredible activities that Obama has been engaged in as of late, compared to other presidents.
[01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:57.458]  And also parallel how everyone says that we have to learn Republican candidate Carson's background and dig through all of it, but the media won't dig through Obama's background that is as phony as a suitcase of $3 bills.
[01:08:59.813 --> 01:09:11.703]  So that is going to be coming up with Joel Gilbert, then Steve Quayle joins us for 30 minutes on the Paris situation, other global threats, and Dr. Steve Pachinik for 30 minutes, then David Knight hosts the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[01:09:11.703 --> 01:09:13.825]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:09:13.825 --> 01:09:16.407]  Paul Joseph Watson is traveling back to the
[01:09:17.988 --> 01:09:30.912]  UK tomorrow for his father's 60th birthday, but Joe Biggs and, of course, Michael Zimmerman, Infowars.com, Austin-based reporters, will be staying through Friday.
[01:09:30.912 --> 01:09:33.773]  And they're going to go get some undercover cameras.
[01:09:33.773 --> 01:09:39.174]  They're going to be documenting the jihad slums outside Paris, but also in Brussels, Belgium.
[01:09:39.174 --> 01:09:46.937]  They're going to be detailing the troops on the streets inside Paris and more, and also getting footage to come back here and make a documentary.
[01:09:48.159 --> 01:09:50.922]  Basically detailing exactly what it was like.
[01:09:50.922 --> 01:10:10.041]  They're also going to be talking to folks on the street and what they think about people like Le Pen, who is a frontrunner in many polls for president right now, being arrested and indicted and facing multiple years in prison for a month ago saying there's an Islamic invasion of France.
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:14.543]  I mean, I thought Europe was free and you had free speech.
[01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:15.804]  I mean, that's why we're there.
[01:10:15.804 --> 01:10:20.327]  It's not just about the 130-something dead last week and the seven attacks.
[01:10:20.327 --> 01:10:22.689]  There's also the refugee centers being burned.
[01:10:22.689 --> 01:10:24.090]  There are some real refugees.
[01:10:24.090 --> 01:10:26.332]  We really feel sorry for them, but the numbers are out.
[01:10:26.332 --> 01:10:38.662]  In the U.S., 2,000-plus Muslim refugees so far, less than 20-something, but the numbers are up on DrugsReport.com, are actually even from
[01:10:40.399 --> 01:10:42.659]  Areas that are Christian.
[01:10:42.659 --> 01:10:46.860]  So you have a fraction of these people that are Christian.
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:53.661]  It is completely and totally outrageous that this is happening.
[01:10:53.661 --> 01:10:57.922]  But we have the video, Paul, today before they went in.
[01:10:57.922 --> 01:11:01.603]  InfoWars set to go into the Islamists' hotbed.
[01:11:01.603 --> 01:11:05.244]  They need to get that report filed tonight with their footage.
[01:11:05.244 --> 01:11:06.784]  It is incredible, I'm told.
[01:11:08.001 --> 01:11:16.060]  To sit here and to witness the fact that it's true, Brussels, Belgium is basically an ISIS command base.
[01:11:17.145 --> 01:11:23.589]  Brussels, Belgium is basically the capital of jihad terror and is now its own state.
[01:11:23.589 --> 01:11:26.250]  I mean, I think that's really the takeaway here.
[01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:27.090]  Here's the number.
[01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:29.091]  Resettlement map in the USA.
[01:11:29.091 --> 01:11:31.473]  We've got a document, Cam, on this for TV viewers.
[01:11:31.473 --> 01:11:36.996]  You can see the map of where this is happening inside the United States.
[01:11:36.996 --> 01:11:39.857]  They plan to send a bunch to Texas, Florida, New York.
[01:11:39.857 --> 01:11:40.818]  I mean, you name it.
[01:11:43.286 --> 01:11:44.027]  Idaho.
[01:11:44.027 --> 01:11:45.167]  I mean, basically the whole country.
[01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:49.670]  I think every state's getting them, but North and South Dakota.
[01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:51.932]  But then you look at the numbers of what's here already. 2098.
[01:11:54.611 --> 01:11:56.272]  Muslims, 53 are Christians.
[01:11:56.272 --> 01:11:59.194]  I don't know why I said 20, my brain messed that up.
[01:11:59.194 --> 01:12:01.715]  So 2,098 Muslims, 53 are Christians.
[01:12:01.715 --> 01:12:03.396]  This is what we're talking about.
[01:12:03.396 --> 01:12:07.999]  And I agree with Glenn Beck, you know, bring in women and children, bring in Christians.
[01:12:07.999 --> 01:12:12.241]  You can even bring in Shiites from places like Syria.
[01:12:12.241 --> 01:12:14.222]  They don't have a history of attacking the country.
[01:12:14.222 --> 01:12:15.923]  That is Syrian Shiites.
[01:12:15.923 --> 01:12:18.525]  But you don't bring in Wahhabis with fake passports.
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:26.304]  I mean, this is a Saudi Arabian, basically, invasion of the world with sleeper cells, and I'm now sure of it.
[01:12:26.304 --> 01:12:34.068]  We're going to Joel Gilbert here in a few minutes, but Paul Joseph Watson, closing comments on what you've witnessed so far, other points that need to be covered.
[01:12:34.068 --> 01:12:37.851]  I don't think we can stress how outrageous this is.
[01:12:40.683 --> 01:12:46.550]  Yeah, I mean, I'm sick to the back teeth of liberals and progressives pretending that these no-go areas don't exist.
[01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:47.591]  We had it in London.
[01:12:47.591 --> 01:12:53.518]  We've got Sharia no-go zones in London, where they've got signs up saying no alcohol allowed.
[01:12:53.518 --> 01:12:55.421]  They harass people on the street.
[01:12:55.421 --> 01:12:59.866]  And it's interesting, you know, because the left is always up in arms about homophobia.
[01:13:00.603 --> 01:13:04.986]  Meanwhile, we've got these ISIS jihadists literally throwing gays off buildings.
[01:13:04.986 --> 01:13:09.509]  I mean, God forbid, if you were a gay person in that area, they would probably string you up.
[01:13:09.509 --> 01:13:13.112]  I also wanted to draw attention to a tweet which I sent you last night.
[01:13:13.112 --> 01:13:17.835]  I made this tweet on September 9th and, you know, I'm not bragging because it was entirely predictable.
[01:13:18.315 --> 01:13:27.141]  So on September 9th I tweeted, I give it two months until one of these refugees, in inverted commas, goes jihadist and kills someone.
[01:13:27.141 --> 01:13:30.703]  The left will call anyone who draws this parallel a racist.
[01:13:30.703 --> 01:13:32.224]  I said that on September 9th.
[01:13:32.224 --> 01:13:38.808]  It was four days after that two-month window, so I was only four days out, that Paris happened.
[01:13:38.808 --> 01:13:43.151]  Of course, one of the suspects, if not more, got into the country, got into Europe on
[01:13:43.291 --> 01:13:44.611]  On a Syrian passport.
[01:13:44.611 --> 01:13:47.692]  Doesn't matter if that passport was forged.
[01:13:47.692 --> 01:13:59.195]  They took his fingerprints at the scene of the Paris attacks, matched them with him coming into Greece, so he abused this migrant red carpet, and it led to the massacre that we saw in Paris.
[01:13:59.195 --> 01:14:04.536]  And it was painfully predictable, and I predicted it two months before I said this is going to happen in two months.
[01:14:04.536 --> 01:14:10.798]  Lo and behold, two months and four days later, it happens, and you know, dozens and dozens of people dead, hundreds injured.
[01:14:10.798 --> 01:14:11.958]  We had the massacre in Paris.
[01:14:13.629 --> 01:14:14.049]  That's right.
[01:14:14.049 --> 01:14:15.929]  In fact, you retweeted that last night.
[01:14:15.929 --> 01:14:20.370]  You sent me the tweet where you had said that months ago, and it happened right on time.
[01:14:20.370 --> 01:14:24.831]  And I'll predict, Paul, as we predicted as well, there'll be more of these attacks.
[01:14:24.831 --> 01:14:39.393]  How many times since the invasion of Syria, Paul, have I said or you said or our reporters said that we're going to see jihad attacks all across Europe, the UK and the United States, and now it's happening.
[01:14:39.393 --> 01:14:41.994]  But when you expand on all of this, Paul,
[01:14:43.323 --> 01:14:53.927]  Most of the attacks on Army, Navy, Marine Corps centers, military bases, Fort Hood, they don't even call them jihad attacks when they happen.
[01:14:53.927 --> 01:14:55.568]  No, there have been attacks.
[01:14:55.568 --> 01:15:03.171]  I think there was one in Belgium, there was one in France as well, where, you know, the jihadist is shouting al-Akbar as he plows his vehicle into police officers.
[01:15:03.171 --> 01:15:04.952]  There was one in Canada as well.
[01:15:04.952 --> 01:15:09.054]  And they just gloss over it and it's disappeared from the media a day later.
[01:15:09.054 --> 01:15:12.175]  But, you know, it goes to the fact that these people were complete cowards.
[01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:16.791]  They are complete cowards.
[01:15:16.791 --> 01:15:18.272]  Paul, Skype again, breaking up.
[01:15:18.272 --> 01:15:22.973]  Joining us from Brussels, Belgium, an hour and a half away from Paris.
[01:15:22.973 --> 01:15:29.695]  Paul, in closing, what are you planning next before you go back to the UK?
[01:15:29.695 --> 01:15:35.677]  I mean, I don't want to give away all of our plans, but are you going to go back into Paris, and I guess the guys will go back into Belgium later?
[01:15:35.677 --> 01:15:40.319]  Obviously, we need to document the 5,000 troops on the streets of Paris.
[01:15:40.319 --> 01:15:43.440]  Can't arm the citizens, but put 5,000 troops on the streets.
[01:15:45.074 --> 01:15:47.015]  Yeah, those troops aren't very visible now though.
[01:15:47.015 --> 01:15:49.397]  I think they were more visible on the first day.
[01:15:49.397 --> 01:15:55.801]  There were some police outside the train station, as Big said, guarding the global warming inflatable like that was important.
[01:15:55.801 --> 01:16:00.424]  But it's not that repressive on the streets of Paris from what we've seen so far.
[01:16:00.424 --> 01:16:12.212]  So it looks like they haven't completely overreacted again in complete difference to what we experienced in London after 7-7, where basically everything we filmed we were getting harassed by police walking up to us.
[01:16:12.632 --> 01:16:15.614]  Here, where you haven't been harassed once for filming or anything like that.
[01:16:15.614 --> 01:16:22.857]  So, in terms of free expression and the media, the state of free speech in Europe still, you know, hangs on.
[01:16:22.857 --> 01:16:28.320]  Until these jihadists have their own way and, you know, all criticism of them is outlawed, I guess.
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:29.500]  Well, not in Germany, though.
[01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:31.161]  They've tried to outlaw demonstrations.
[01:16:31.161 --> 01:16:32.382]  That doesn't seem to be working.
[01:16:32.382 --> 01:16:36.324]  And that's the answer to this ban on free speech, is just exercise it regardless.
[01:16:37.856 --> 01:16:42.962]  Exactly, and of course you've got the Facebook situation with Merkel going after hate speech.
[01:16:42.962 --> 01:16:46.667]  If you actually drill down into some of those comments, they weren't violent at all.
[01:16:46.667 --> 01:16:53.515]  Now you've got ex-Stasi officials in Germany cracking down on that, which is only going to make the whole Pegida movement and the backlash bigger.
[01:16:55.615 --> 01:16:57.296]  More power to them if they want to do that.
[01:16:57.296 --> 01:17:09.882]  It's only going to blow back in their faces because, you know, free speech is a more powerful ideology than anything that these cowardly jihadists with their crappy little suicide bombs in which they can only blow up themselves targeting innocent people.
[01:17:09.882 --> 01:17:13.324]  It's a bigger, stronger principle than anything they can ever achieve.
[01:17:14.079 --> 01:17:15.039]  That's right.
[01:17:15.039 --> 01:17:24.081]  And we're going to work to make sure our corrupt Western governments don't use these attacks to be misdirected against innocent Muslim nations that have been the same victims of this filth.
[01:17:24.081 --> 01:17:33.063]  Our filthy governments turn these very dogs, these very pigs, these very rats, loose on the people of Egypt, Libya, Syria, and Iraq.
[01:17:33.063 --> 01:17:35.143]  And we are kicking their butts worldwide.
[01:17:35.143 --> 01:17:35.943]  We're exposing it.
[01:17:35.943 --> 01:17:40.324]  And our own governments have now been forced to go after ISIS because we've exposed them.
[01:17:40.324 --> 01:17:42.505]  There goes Paul Watson from
[01:17:43.649 --> 01:17:45.671]  Belgium, from Brussels, Belgium.
[01:17:45.671 --> 01:17:51.235]  We're going to go to break, come back for the Balance of the Hour with Joel Gilbert, documentary filmmaker.
[01:17:51.235 --> 01:17:54.338]  We also have Steve Quill joining us and Dr. Steve Pachinik.

[01:18:12.352 --> 01:18:13.413]  The energy.
[01:18:13.413 --> 01:18:17.678]  Here is Team Liberty Radio out of Boone, North Carolina.
[01:18:17.678 --> 01:18:21.442]  Said, I love natural solutions and supplements, and this is a great product.
[01:18:21.442 --> 01:18:25.226]  I used to do energy drinks and shots before work, but no more.
[01:18:25.226 --> 01:18:27.269]  This is great.
[01:18:27.269 --> 01:18:28.350]  Five-star review.
[01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:31.213]  Infowarslife.com for super male vitality.
[01:18:31.213 --> 01:18:32.535]  Link, Tulsa, Oklahoma.
[01:18:34.508 --> 01:18:36.829]  Says, I feel 13 again.
[01:18:36.829 --> 01:18:37.649]  Good taste.
[01:18:37.649 --> 01:18:38.449]  No side effects.
[01:18:38.449 --> 01:18:38.869]  I disagree.
[01:18:38.869 --> 01:18:40.749]  It tastes bad.
[01:18:40.749 --> 01:18:42.130]  Produces results.
[01:18:42.130 --> 01:18:43.170]  Simple to take.
[01:18:43.170 --> 01:18:45.310]  Two squirts twice a day.
[01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:47.471]  This product is a revolutionary product.
[01:18:47.471 --> 01:18:51.232]  It's effectively increased after second month in a big way.
[01:18:51.232 --> 01:18:53.812]  I used a little extra on performance time.
[01:18:53.812 --> 01:18:54.933]  No ill side effects.
[01:18:54.933 --> 01:18:55.893]  Yes, I would recommend it.
[01:18:56.573 --> 01:19:01.937]  Now that's the type of reviews that we've got for InfoWars Life Product.
[01:19:01.937 --> 01:19:04.839]  Super male vitality, super female vitality.
[01:19:04.839 --> 01:19:08.602]  Just the libido alone, me personally.
[01:19:08.602 --> 01:19:10.163]  Me personally.
[01:19:10.163 --> 01:19:13.565]  Not that I ever needed it, but everybody experiments.
[01:19:13.565 --> 01:19:16.927]  I went to the doctor, had my blood tested a year ago, had all my stuff checked.
[01:19:16.927 --> 01:19:19.009]  I had everything good, but a little bit high blood sugar.
[01:19:19.009 --> 01:19:20.790]  It was pre-pre-diabetic.
[01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:23.572]  Not pre-diabetic, just kind of pre-pre, getting in a bad zone.
[01:19:23.572 --> 01:19:24.393]  Everything else was great.
[01:19:25.543 --> 01:19:27.884]  He said, hey, you want some Cialis?
[01:19:27.884 --> 01:19:30.746]  I said, yeah, why not see what it does?
[01:19:30.746 --> 01:19:34.587]  I'm here to tell you, Supramel Vitality, I didn't even intend it to do that.
[01:19:34.587 --> 01:19:36.028]  Incredible results.
[01:19:36.028 --> 01:19:38.349]  And that's what most people really notice.
[01:19:38.349 --> 01:19:40.310]  Imagine what it's doing for the rest of your body.
[01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:44.052]  And it's all natural herbs, concentrated, organic, wet pressed.
[01:19:44.372 --> 01:19:46.174]  So it's not dried out garbage.
[01:19:46.174 --> 01:19:47.976]  Infowarslife.com.

[01:20:25.929 --> 01:20:27.470]  Kick some ash with Le Cig.
[01:20:28.561 --> 01:20:30.522]  Who's among the worst at keeping your data private?
[01:20:30.522 --> 01:20:34.285]  The Electronic Frontier Foundation Privacy Report says it's AT&T.
[01:20:34.285 --> 01:20:40.529]  AT&T customers need to know this when calling the Alex Jones 24-7 listen line at 1-605-562-9000.
[01:20:40.529 --> 01:20:41.769]  Big Brother is listening.

[01:20:45.932 --> 01:20:50.295]  Call the Alex Jones 24-7 listen line on any phone, but please don't use AT&T.
[01:20:50.295 --> 01:20:52.957]  For everyone else, bookmark Alex Jones listen line number today.
[01:20:52.957 --> 01:20:53.097]  1-605-562-9000.
[01:20:53.097 --> 01:20:53.477]  That's 1-605-562-9000.
[01:21:00.816 --> 01:21:05.457]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[01:21:05.457 --> 01:21:09.738]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[01:21:09.738 --> 01:21:11.119]  We typically do the same thing.
[01:21:11.119 --> 01:21:14.160]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:16.360]  But have you considered heat storage?
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:18.561]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[01:21:18.561 --> 01:21:20.862]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[01:21:20.862 --> 01:21:22.502]  How will I keep my family warm?
[01:21:22.502 --> 01:21:24.983]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[01:21:24.983 --> 01:21:29.044]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[01:21:29.864 --> 01:21:30.985]  Another concern?
[01:21:30.985 --> 01:21:34.968]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[01:21:34.968 --> 01:21:37.549]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[01:21:37.549 --> 01:21:41.532]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[01:21:41.532 --> 01:21:44.334]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[01:21:44.334 --> 01:21:48.997]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[01:21:48.997 --> 01:21:50.999]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[01:21:50.999 --> 01:21:52.640]  FortressClothing.com.
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:53.981]  You'll never be cold again.
[01:21:57.751 --> 01:22:01.997]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:01.997 --> 01:22:02.618]  It's true.
[01:22:02.618 --> 01:22:06.784]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:06.784 --> 01:22:09.167]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:09.167 --> 01:22:13.654]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:13.934 --> 01:22:26.821]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[01:22:30.603 --> 01:22:33.264]  The gold standard in water purification.

[01:22:37.565 --> 01:22:38.385]  Big Berkey.
[01:22:38.385 --> 01:22:42.086]  The one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[01:22:42.086 --> 01:22:43.846]  Get your Big Berkey today.

[01:22:48.288 --> 01:22:49.348]  For the love of clean water.
[01:22:57.435 --> 01:23:06.340]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:07.441]  Silver Lungs.

[01:23:26.972 --> 01:23:30.034]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:23:30.034 --> 01:23:32.676]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:23:32.676 --> 01:23:33.417]  Croix River.
[01:23:33.417 --> 01:23:35.639]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:23:35.639 --> 01:23:38.601]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:23:38.601 --> 01:23:39.482]  His excuse?
[01:23:39.482 --> 01:23:40.823]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:23:40.823 --> 01:23:42.424]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:23:42.424 --> 01:23:48.188]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[01:23:48.188 --> 01:23:49.229]  Don't wait.

[01:24:27.742 --> 01:24:30.344]  Joe Gilbert, documentary filmmaker, is our guest.
[01:24:30.344 --> 01:24:33.146]  He made, of course, the hit film, Dreams of My Real Father.
[01:24:33.146 --> 01:24:43.574]  He also has produced the films, Atomic Jihad, Farewell Israel, Bush-Iran, The Revolt of Islam.
[01:24:43.574 --> 01:24:50.239]  And, you know, I tell you, I wanted to get him on to parallel the situation with Ben Carson, how they're digging through his whole background.
[01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:53.541]  And finding small anomalies and demonizing him.
[01:24:53.541 --> 01:24:54.981]  But what about Obama's background?
[01:24:54.981 --> 01:24:57.583]  Different names, different birth certificates.
[01:24:57.583 --> 01:25:01.705]  I mean, you know, the Harvard Law Review that he edited says he was born in Kenya.
[01:25:01.705 --> 01:25:03.506]  His wife says he's born in Kenya.
[01:25:03.506 --> 01:25:04.767]  Then he says he never said that.
[01:25:04.767 --> 01:25:06.028]  Well, it's all cover.
[01:25:06.028 --> 01:25:08.769]  He was born in Hawaii to Frank Marshall Davis.
[01:25:08.769 --> 01:25:10.170]  It's all hiding in plain view.
[01:25:10.170 --> 01:25:12.111]  He admits he stayed summers with him.
[01:25:12.111 --> 01:25:13.212]  The same photos.
[01:25:13.212 --> 01:25:15.113]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:25:15.113 --> 01:25:18.195]  But I gotta be honest, Joel Gilbert's an expert on radical Islam.
[01:25:19.198 --> 01:25:28.864]  And has been involved exposing that, and I used to see Gilbert's work in 2008, 2010, never had him on about Islam, because it sounded crazy to me.
[01:25:28.864 --> 01:25:37.289]  That they'd open Europe and America and bring in jihadis, and there was a plan for a caliphate with Obama, and he's the guy that kind of woke up Glenn Beck in people.
[01:25:38.427 --> 01:25:40.348]  And I've got to now say, I was wrong.
[01:25:40.348 --> 01:25:44.369]  I mean, I don't know if they're going to actually set it up, but they're sure letting them try.
[01:25:44.369 --> 01:25:48.011]  They sure overthrew all these allies and put these people in charge.
[01:25:48.011 --> 01:25:56.034]  So, Joel, in this short segment and the next few segments, we'll give you the floor to get into the parallels and talk about your films that we sell at InfoWarsStore.com, I should add.
[01:25:57.154 --> 01:26:00.719]  On the Jihad, I mean, how did you see this coming in 2008?
[01:26:00.719 --> 01:26:09.772]  Because, I mean, I respected you when you did films that were put in millions of mailboxes and all that stuff you did, but I just still thought it was kind of whacked out.
[01:26:09.772 --> 01:26:11.794]  What crystal ball were you looking into, buddy?
[01:26:12.728 --> 01:26:31.625]  Well, if you understand the goals and value of Islamists, of the Islamist agenda, everything is pretty easy to understand and it's always a disappointment for me that our policy makers don't consult experts in the area and they simply react to whatever is happening that week.
[01:26:31.625 --> 01:26:38.111]  In my film, Farewell Israel, I documented how 9-11 was successful from the point of view of
[01:26:39.551 --> 01:26:49.838]  of Bin Laden and the Islamists, not because they killed people in New York, but because they drew America into the Middle East and they caused a change in American policy.
[01:26:49.838 --> 01:26:56.663]  The goal of 9-11 was to bring America in and enlist America in the Islamist cause.
[01:26:56.663 --> 01:27:00.105]  Don't forget the Islamists in Al-Qaeda were fighting Saddam Hussein.
[01:27:00.105 --> 01:27:01.666]  They were fighting Gaddafi.
[01:27:01.666 --> 01:27:02.747]  They were fighting Assad.
[01:27:02.747 --> 01:27:05.549]  They were trying to get rid of the King of Saudi Arabia.
[01:27:05.549 --> 01:27:06.950]  They were trying to get rid of Mubarak.
[01:27:07.745 --> 01:27:16.611]  After 9-11, George Bush implemented what he called a freedom agenda to help, in his mind, bring freedom to the Muslims of the Middle East.
[01:27:16.611 --> 01:27:22.836]  And if we would just have a democratic election, then liberal democracy would break out all over the place.
[01:27:22.836 --> 01:27:28.760]  The Islamists knew that if there were free elections, and they got rid of these autocrats, they would replace them with
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:29.720]  I think so.
[01:27:38.666 --> 01:27:44.108]  Unfortunately, again, there's a big lack of understanding of ISIS.
[01:27:44.108 --> 01:27:50.951]  ISIS today acts as a counterbalance to the influence of Iran and Hezbollah in the region.
[01:27:50.951 --> 01:27:58.174]  If America and the West eliminate ISIS and attack ISIS, number one, it gives them an excuse to attack us.
[01:27:58.174 --> 01:28:06.058]  Number two, if we do defeat ISIS, Iran and Hezbollah will simply take over those areas and start slaughtering all the Sunni Muslims
[01:28:06.798 --> 01:28:10.521]  Just as the ISIS was doing to the Shia.
[01:28:10.521 --> 01:28:11.622]  And what are we going to do then?
[01:28:11.622 --> 01:28:17.206]  Go back in and now defeat the Iranians and then pull back out and then ISIS comes back in.
[01:28:17.206 --> 01:28:23.972]  So there's a fundamental misunderstanding of the force of Islamism and what it represents and what its goals are.
[01:28:23.972 --> 01:28:26.614]  And that's what I've been trying to educate through my films.
[01:28:28.652 --> 01:28:34.839]  And it really does show the original Machiavellian idea doesn't come from Italy, it comes from the Middle East.
[01:28:34.839 --> 01:28:46.533]  If you go back to even pre-Mohammed, the constant stabbing in the back, joining other sides, different combinations, different alliances, just creates total instability.
[01:28:47.423 --> 01:28:51.525]  And it's very, very sad to see us sucked into this craziness.
[01:28:51.525 --> 01:28:51.985]  Exactly.
[01:28:51.985 --> 01:28:57.767]  What we don't understand in the West is that nation-states do not exist in the Middle East.
[01:28:57.767 --> 01:29:04.150]  The nation-state of, you're an Italian, you're a Frenchman, you're German.
[01:29:04.150 --> 01:29:10.713]  The nation-state is a Western invention that was meant as a Christian solution for Christian problems.
[01:29:11.657 --> 01:29:19.241]  During the Middle Ages, the Protestant Reformation came about because of opposition to the control by the Catholic Church.
[01:29:19.241 --> 01:29:30.468]  So the Protestants and the Secularists took a hundred years to get rid of the Church as the political power, and nationalism, nation states, secular nation states,
[01:29:31.068 --> 01:29:33.729]  We're the solution to create a new political order.
[01:29:33.729 --> 01:29:34.149]  Stay there.
[01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:37.891]  Continue breaking this down to understand the clash of civilizations.
[01:29:37.891 --> 01:29:39.911]  We came out of the Dark Ages.
[01:29:39.911 --> 01:29:42.732]  The Middle East never did, is what Joel Gilbert's saying.
[01:29:42.732 --> 01:29:48.034]  And now the socialists are trying to integrate Stone Age societies with us.
[01:29:48.034 --> 01:29:49.415]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.415 --> 01:29:51.956]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.956 --> 01:29:54.617]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:11.243]  CIA boss John Brennan said Monday violating the Fourth Amendment and eliminating the privacy of virtually every American will be required if the United States hopes to stop the attacks by the Islamic State.
[01:30:11.243 --> 01:30:22.685]  He said recent proposed NSA reforms and a return to the principles enshrined in the Constitution will make our ability collectively, internationally to find these terrorists much more challenging.
[01:30:22.685 --> 01:30:27.106]  I would anticipate this is not the only operation ISIL has in the pipeline.
[01:30:27.386 --> 01:30:32.549]  Brennan said in remarks delivered at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
[01:30:32.549 --> 01:30:46.718]  During the Intelligence and National Security Summit in September, officials from the FBI, CIA, NSA, NGO, DIA, and NRO decried the deep cynicism of American people over surveillance.
[01:30:46.718 --> 01:30:52.361]  Brennan attributed this to a misunderstanding between the American people and the American government.
[01:30:52.361 --> 01:30:56.344]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[01:31:01.913 --> 01:31:10.179]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:10.179 --> 01:31:15.583]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:31:29.435 --> 01:31:31.657]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:31:31.657 --> 01:31:36.641]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[01:31:36.641 --> 01:31:39.944]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:31:39.944 --> 01:31:43.427]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:31:43.427 --> 01:31:45.129]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:31:45.469 --> 01:31:46.330]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[01:31:46.330 --> 01:31:47.511]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:31:47.511 --> 01:31:49.513]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[01:32:39.767 --> 01:32:44.090]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.

[01:33:06.852 --> 01:33:07.453]  I think so.
[01:33:20.882 --> 01:33:23.224]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:23.224 --> 01:33:26.447]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:26.447 --> 01:33:33.053]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:33.053 --> 01:33:35.394]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.394 --> 01:33:37.376]  Joel Gilbert is our guest.
[01:33:37.376 --> 01:33:45.303]  If you haven't seen his documentary, Dreams, from my real father, it's available at infowarestore.com or at joelgilbert.net.
[01:33:45.303 --> 01:33:47.325]  It's incredibly conclusive.
[01:33:48.662 --> 01:33:51.354]  On who Obama's real father is, and that the whole...
[01:33:52.614 --> 01:33:59.537]  Kenya birth certificate situation was a distraction from the fact that his father was Frank Marshall Davis.
[01:33:59.537 --> 01:34:16.383]  Photos of him in the house, Obama admitting he was raised in the house, that his grandfather was best friends with him, his mother photographed shooting the porn with Frank Marshall Davis on the same couch, in the same living room that Obama has released photos of himself on.
[01:34:16.383 --> 01:34:18.804]  I mean, it is open and shut.
[01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:28.373]  And they set us up, didn't they, with those fake birth certificates, and Obama saying he was born in Kenya, and then saying he never said that.
[01:34:28.373 --> 01:34:30.713]  All meant to bait us in.
[01:34:30.713 --> 01:34:33.734]  And Joel Gilbert blew it wide open.
[01:34:33.734 --> 01:34:35.115]  It's incredible.
[01:34:35.115 --> 01:34:36.795]  Going back to Joel Gilbert.
[01:34:36.795 --> 01:34:42.237]  Joel, so, we have this dark age system.
[01:34:42.237 --> 01:34:47.819]  And you have some Muslims that want to live in peace and want to be left alone, but they're the ones always being murdered and slaughtered and taken over.
[01:34:48.496 --> 01:34:51.598]  By the radicals in Islam, I mean, it's clear.
[01:34:51.598 --> 01:34:57.522]  Why then would the West fund them to go after Assad and then bring so many of them in?
[01:34:57.522 --> 01:35:00.845]  Don't the leftists, doesn't Hollande and Merkel and Obama?
[01:35:02.106 --> 01:35:05.008]  Know that they're going to attack and have been attacking?
[01:35:05.008 --> 01:35:08.691]  I mean, we saw these Army, Navy, Marine Corps recruiting center attacks.
[01:35:08.691 --> 01:35:10.052]  We saw the Fort Hood attack.
[01:35:10.052 --> 01:35:11.153]  We saw the Garland attack.
[01:35:11.153 --> 01:35:13.495]  They kept saying, not there, not there, not there.
[01:35:13.495 --> 01:35:16.197]  And then now they can't spin this.
[01:35:16.197 --> 01:35:20.600]  What are they thinking when they bring these refugees in by the millions?
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:25.604]  What is the end game point of the politicians and where do you see this going?
[01:35:25.604 --> 01:35:30.088]  Well, you have to know that Barack Obama is a revolutionary Marxist.
[01:35:31.111 --> 01:35:38.878]  His goal is to disrupt and destroy the free market system and the free speech system that we have in America.
[01:35:38.878 --> 01:35:40.039]  Marxists and Islamists
[01:35:40.939 --> 01:35:49.285]  Have always had the same goal in common, and that is to destroy the Western society and the Western capitalist system.
[01:35:49.285 --> 01:35:54.408]  They see this as the number one obstacle to taking power, and therefore their common enemy.
[01:35:54.408 --> 01:36:01.373]  That's why the Soviet Union worked so closely with building up Islamist groups in the heyday of the Soviet Empire.
[01:36:02.233 --> 01:36:04.134]  Obama is simply continuing that.
[01:36:04.134 --> 01:36:10.297]  He identifies with the Islamist struggle and cause against the evil Western powers.
[01:36:10.297 --> 01:36:16.501]  It's Obama's natural inclination to partner with Islamist groups.
[01:36:16.501 --> 01:36:18.502]  He has a great deal of sympathy for them.
[01:36:18.502 --> 01:36:21.083]  And when we go back to talking about Obama's biography,
[01:36:22.142 --> 01:36:33.212]  In Dreams from My Father, he wrote, for example, about his childhood in Indonesia, a Muslim country, what he tried to hide, which I have, through my latest research, I think, uncovered.
[01:36:33.212 --> 01:36:38.456]  He claimed that he went from Occidental College, after two years, to Columbia for two more years.
[01:36:38.456 --> 01:36:41.239]  I think it's very clear, and I have a lot of evidence to support it,
[01:36:42.034 --> 01:36:47.956]  That Obama spent his junior year abroad in Pakistan, living as an adult in a Muslim country.
[01:36:47.956 --> 01:36:54.738]  And that's where he gained his affinity for the Islamic culture and Islamic religion, and his sympathy for everything Islam.
[01:36:54.738 --> 01:36:57.979]  And I think you can see that in his policies toward the Middle East.
[01:36:57.979 --> 01:37:08.782]  I've also chronicled that his education was paid for by the Saudis, who supported a fund for radical black students in the 80s, and that's how he got into Harvard.
[01:37:08.782 --> 01:37:10.983]  Once the Saudis finished with him academically,
[01:37:11.917 --> 01:37:16.878]  They handed him over to the Arab-funded political network with Tony Rezko.
[01:37:16.878 --> 01:37:25.501]  So Obama's entire academic and political career were funded by Middle Eastern interests because he identified with the Islamist goals all this time.
[01:37:25.501 --> 01:37:28.722]  Now we know his grandfather was CIA and we know he's tied into that.
[01:37:28.722 --> 01:37:38.064]  I always thought he was a deep cover infiltrator into the deep cover sleeper Islam political cells.
[01:37:38.064 --> 01:37:39.765]  But are you saying this may be a triple cross?
[01:37:41.824 --> 01:37:47.747]  Look, Obama was raised and radicalized by his real biological father, Frank Marshall Davis.
[01:37:47.747 --> 01:38:00.172]  He admits to being raised by him, and he's done a great deal to try to distance himself from the connection to Davis, including a nose job, which is chronicled on my website, obamasrealfather.com.
[01:38:00.172 --> 01:38:03.733]  He scrubbed Frank Marshall Davis from the audiobook of Dreams for My Father.
[01:38:04.261 --> 01:38:13.144]  But the political ideology shows that he was radicalized by Davis, who was a Soviet agent, a pro-Russian sympathizer, anti-American, anti-white.
[01:38:13.144 --> 01:38:14.724]  And by the way, all that is admitted.
[01:38:14.724 --> 01:38:18.566]  Frank Marshall Davis was one of the highest level communists in the U.S.
[01:38:18.566 --> 01:38:18.946]  Correct.
[01:38:18.946 --> 01:38:25.488]  He was on Security Index A. That meant if there was a conflict between Russia and the Soviet Union, Davis would be immediately arrested.
[01:38:26.072 --> 01:38:36.483]  When Frank Marshall Davis dies in 1987, I'm sorry, 1985, Obama shows up at Reverend Wright's church, and that becomes his substitute father figure.
[01:38:36.483 --> 01:38:38.245]  It's literally the same guy.
[01:38:38.245 --> 01:38:44.833]  Obama is very comfortable with anti-American extremists, and they're comfortable with him because he has a shared ideology.
[01:38:45.513 --> 01:38:54.303]  And the ideology of Islam, which is anti-Western, anti-Israel, anti-capitalist, these are brothers in arms.
[01:38:54.303 --> 01:39:04.914]  And that's how you can understand Obama's Middle East policy and why he wants to bring in Muslim refugees, even though there's a high likelihood of
[01:39:05.595 --> 01:39:06.976]  Of terrorist attacks in the United States.
[01:39:21.761 --> 01:39:22.882]  They're self-haters.
[01:39:22.882 --> 01:39:29.067]  They're people that believe in an international revolutionary movement.
[01:39:29.067 --> 01:39:32.871]  The nationalist movement which brought the West to success.
[01:39:32.871 --> 01:39:34.052]  It made America great.
[01:39:34.052 --> 01:39:37.355]  It created all this wealth and we spread it out all over the world.
[01:39:38.075 --> 01:39:38.355]  I think?
[01:39:56.170 --> 01:39:58.832]  And he committed the biggest fraud in the history of the United States.
[01:39:58.832 --> 01:40:02.054]  He claimed to be a centrist running for office.
[01:40:02.054 --> 01:40:03.835]  He said, I'm going to cut the deficit in half.
[01:40:03.835 --> 01:40:04.876]  I'll support Israel.
[01:40:04.876 --> 01:40:06.537]  Obamacare is not a tax.
[01:40:06.537 --> 01:40:08.899]  Everything he said was an intentional lie.
[01:40:08.899 --> 01:40:19.806]  And I even showed that in my movie, There's No Place Like Utopia, that it's almost like The Wizard of Oz, where Obama made all these phony promises and people just thought, I'll just go down the yellow brick road.
[01:40:19.806 --> 01:40:24.590]  But just like Dorothy got to the Emerald City and the wizard sent her
[01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:29.652]  To the witch's castle where she was taken prisoner in a dungeon in the Gulag.
[01:40:29.652 --> 01:40:36.614]  So the road to, uh, the path of socialism, Marxism, all this nonsense always leads to the Gulag.
[01:40:36.614 --> 01:40:37.414]  Doesn't lead to prosperity.
[01:40:37.414 --> 01:40:38.815]  Well, let's expand on that.
[01:40:38.815 --> 01:40:40.535]  Israel is a diverse country.
[01:40:40.535 --> 01:40:43.096]  It has, you know, six, seven big parties.
[01:40:43.096 --> 01:40:48.078]  You've got socialists, you've got right-wingers, you've got three, four different types of Zionists.
[01:40:48.078 --> 01:40:50.139]  But I personally have experienced, Joel,
[01:40:51.135 --> 01:40:55.817]  The mental illness of the anti-Israelers.
[01:40:55.817 --> 01:41:00.139]  Some of the Arabs, some of the white supremacist groups, some of the liberal groups.
[01:41:00.139 --> 01:41:03.481]  I was never even what you'd call a supporter of Israel.
[01:41:03.481 --> 01:41:08.984]  I just knew that it was a football issue used back and forth, so I didn't get into it.
[01:41:08.984 --> 01:41:13.306]  But to experience how they've even gotten a lot of libertarians and conservatives
[01:41:14.537 --> 01:41:38.889]  To support leftist UN propaganda by demonizing Israel until hating Israel has become like a sickening religion and then I've been so demonized by the groups that attack Israel and so lied about it pushes me towards Israel even though I stayed out of it because the people attacking Israel are such incredible liars and exaggerators and just make stuff up constantly.
[01:41:39.329 --> 01:41:51.481]  I mean they're just incredible and then I track it back to again Saudi Arabian funding over and over again basically financing these groups and flying these right wingers over there and all the rest of it.
[01:41:51.481 --> 01:41:52.402]  I mean it's really sick.
[01:41:53.456 --> 01:41:57.900]  Well, people don't understand that Israel is the number one U.S.
[01:41:57.900 --> 01:41:59.862]  ally in the world, let alone the Middle East.
[01:41:59.862 --> 01:42:10.352]  It's only because of Israel in the era of Soviet Union during the Cold War, Israel held back all those Soviet-backed states that were trying to dominate the region, dominate the Gulf, and dominate oil.
[01:42:11.229 --> 01:42:19.434]  Today, Israel is the bulwark of U.S., Western, and European defense against Iranian expansion, Islamist expansion.
[01:42:19.434 --> 01:42:22.495]  If Israel wasn't there, ISIS would be in Jordan.
[01:42:22.495 --> 01:42:25.197]  ISIS would be into Saudi Arabia.
[01:42:25.197 --> 01:42:33.902]  So, Israel really is the defender, at this point, of Western civilization against the Iranian and Islamist invasion.
[01:42:33.902 --> 01:42:36.063]  And without Israel, the United States would be less secure.
[01:42:37.383 --> 01:42:43.066]  What do you say about Jews like George Soros who admits he's behind the refugee crisis?
[01:42:43.066 --> 01:42:53.612]  Don't forget George Soros was a Nazi collaborator, something he never apologized for, and lo and behold he showed up in London in his early career selling
[01:42:54.875 --> 01:42:58.618]  Paintings, valuable artworks that were confiscated by the Nazis.
[01:42:58.618 --> 01:43:14.790]  So his early role, whether he was originally a Nazi agent, whether he became a Soviet agent after that, all of this is something that hasn't rightfully been exposed properly about what his real roots are.
[01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:16.771]  We know he was a Nazi collaborator.
[01:43:16.771 --> 01:43:18.713]  We know he worked with the Soviet Union on some level.
[01:43:19.574 --> 01:43:27.442]  George Soros is a Marxist and supports and pays for all the radical anti-American groups.
[01:43:27.442 --> 01:43:33.108]  He's probably one of the most... He's funding at least 10 groups that are after me constantly with dirty tricks you can't even imagine.
[01:43:33.108 --> 01:43:39.074]  Well, I encourage you to look at his early history and his history as a Nazi collaborator and...
[01:43:40.275 --> 01:43:41.757]  Why hasn't Israel gone after him?
[01:43:41.757 --> 01:43:43.479]  Because they go after other old Nazis.
[01:43:43.479 --> 01:43:52.368]  Soros went on, what, 60 minutes, like 15 years ago, the clips online, but they always expunge it, and said, I don't apologize, I did what I had to do.
[01:43:52.368 --> 01:44:01.218]  He actually goes rounding up Jews, helping find Jews, helping steal their money, and then he's running around free.
[01:44:02.395 --> 01:44:09.418]  I think he should be investigated, not only for his connection to the Nazis, but to the Soviet Union after the war.
[01:44:09.418 --> 01:44:14.760]  And I don't know why they don't go after him, but he's so well-embedded in American politics.
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:22.403]  He's probably one of the most dangerous people because he's got so much wealth, and he provides it to the radical anti-American groups.
[01:44:22.403 --> 01:44:25.524]  And he's an ally of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, by the way.
[01:44:25.524 --> 01:44:26.624]  Oh sure, he's the guy behind him.
[01:44:26.624 --> 01:44:28.025]  And I just want to say this right now to listeners.
[01:44:29.065 --> 01:44:29.906]  Putting on a show.
[01:44:29.906 --> 01:44:31.827]  I'm not saying, hey, I'm a big man.
[01:44:31.827 --> 01:44:36.250]  Joel Gilbert, WorldNetDaily, Matt Drudge, myself, people like us.
[01:44:36.250 --> 01:44:39.352]  We are in the crosshairs of these folks, okay?
[01:44:39.352 --> 01:44:40.152]  This isn't a game.
[01:44:40.152 --> 01:44:41.333]  We need your prayers.
[01:44:41.333 --> 01:44:42.614]  We need you to buy our products.
[01:44:42.614 --> 01:44:43.875]  We need you to support us.
[01:44:43.875 --> 01:44:49.778]  We need you to spread the word about the show because we're not up here saying and doing all this for fun.
[01:44:49.778 --> 01:44:50.539]  We're in a fight.
[01:44:51.667 --> 01:44:56.477]  And I want people to really, really sit back and realize you ask folks to take on tyranny.
[01:44:56.477 --> 01:44:58.301]  You ask people to stand up against evil.
[01:44:58.301 --> 01:45:00.966]  We're doing it, okay?
[01:45:00.966 --> 01:45:01.687]  We're doing it.
[01:45:02.728 --> 01:45:04.668]  And you need to buy Joel Gilbert's films.
[01:45:04.668 --> 01:45:05.589]  You need to buy his books.
[01:45:05.589 --> 01:45:10.870]  You need to buy my books, my films, my materials, so we can fund this operation, so we can do more.
[01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:15.071]  We spend most of our time just trying to fund our operations, instead of fighting the globalists.
[01:45:15.071 --> 01:45:16.551]  We need your support.
[01:45:16.551 --> 01:45:17.331]  We need your prayers.
[01:45:17.331 --> 01:45:18.171]  This is not a game.
[01:45:18.171 --> 01:45:23.752]  I've never asked Joel what he's been through, but Project Veritas has been arrested, threatened, attacked.
[01:45:23.752 --> 01:45:28.633]  We've been attacked, demonized, just viciously.
[01:45:28.633 --> 01:45:30.774]  And it's only intensifying, and it's creepy.
[01:45:31.334 --> 01:45:49.221]  When White House run organizations, like MSNBC, Media Matters, you name it, get up on TV, if they had Bill Maher, two weeks ago, put up on screen, Infowars.com, and a fake headline, saying cancer is not bad for you, that's the kind of stuff they do.
[01:45:49.221 --> 01:45:55.944]  They get up on MSNBC and say Alex Jones doesn't like black people, and is deeply racist, with no proof.
[01:45:56.874 --> 01:46:02.383]  Now that's dangerous, folks, and they wouldn't be doing things like that if they weren't desperate.
[01:46:02.383 --> 01:46:06.470]  Because just a few years ago, they wouldn't lie like that because they could lose lawsuits.
[01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:08.633]  Now, they don't even care if they get sued.
[01:46:08.633 --> 01:46:10.196]  That shows they've entered a new phase.
[01:46:10.196 --> 01:46:11.358]  Joel Gilbert, what do you say to that?
[01:46:12.805 --> 01:46:20.288]  I'm going to have to agree with you because don't forget the Black Lives Matter movement meets in the White House with Barack Obama.
[01:46:20.288 --> 01:46:24.150]  His operatives helped start and fund the organization.
[01:46:24.150 --> 01:46:30.473]  Black Lives Matter is a movement not dissimilar to the Weather Underground.
[01:46:30.473 --> 01:46:32.574]  The SDS were anti-police.
[01:46:32.574 --> 01:46:35.976]  They said let's murder the police, let's kill the policemen, kill your parents.
[01:46:36.876 --> 01:46:51.218]  This was a movement to destroy law and order in the United States, to allow for this communist revolution that Obama's mentor Bill Ayers and his terrorist gang wanted to carry through.
[01:46:51.218 --> 01:47:06.301]  So we see a resurrection of that anti-cop 60s movement through Barack Obama, whose father was part of that and whose mentor his entire life was involved with these radical groups out of Chicago like ACORN and the Alinsky Gang.
[01:47:07.642 --> 01:47:11.284]  It's definitely a new phase where they just don't, you're right, they don't mind lying.
[01:47:11.284 --> 01:47:15.747]  They walk radical Islamists, Muslim Brotherhood, Black Lives Matter.
[01:47:15.747 --> 01:47:17.768]  They're all meeting in the White House today.
[01:47:17.768 --> 01:47:20.870]  That would not have been possible five, six years ago.
[01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:25.053]  Does that mean they think they're stronger or they're making their move?
[01:47:25.053 --> 01:47:27.315]  I think both.
[01:47:27.315 --> 01:47:31.077]  Don't forget, the Obama White House and Department of Justice
[01:47:33.223 --> 01:47:33.543]  I think?
[01:47:51.385 --> 01:47:52.526]  Take power.
[01:47:52.526 --> 01:47:53.987]  Use people to take power.
[01:47:53.987 --> 01:47:55.809]  Use poor people to take power.
[01:47:55.809 --> 01:48:03.216]  That is classical totalitarianism to persecute tens of thousands of Christian veterans and Second Amendment groups.
[01:48:03.216 --> 01:48:04.077]  That's right out of...
[01:48:05.322 --> 01:48:06.663]  A totalitarian dictatorship.
[01:48:06.663 --> 01:48:11.046]  It's right out of the Maoist, Leninist playbook, is lie to people.
[01:48:11.046 --> 01:48:12.467]  Don't tell them your true agenda.
[01:48:12.467 --> 01:48:13.788]  Tell them you want to help them.
[01:48:13.788 --> 01:48:15.989]  Tell them you want to give them free things.
[01:48:15.989 --> 01:48:17.130]  Use them to take power.
[01:48:17.130 --> 01:48:24.215]  And once you take power, use the tools of state, like the IRS, the press, to keep a permanent hold on power.
[01:48:24.215 --> 01:48:25.976]  And that's been the game plan all along.
[01:48:25.976 --> 01:48:31.040]  It's a soft Marxist revolution that's been taking place right under our eyes.
[01:48:33.058 --> 01:48:43.741]  It's so crazy to see black unemployment double by design under Obama so they can have even more control over these folks and then to have some of the black people not know they're being targeted.
[01:48:43.741 --> 01:48:57.544]  Yeah, everything that's wrong with public policy in urban America, 50% unemployment, black youth, drug culture, crime, single motherhood, everything that can be affected by public policy Democrats are responsible for.
[01:48:58.044 --> 01:49:08.530]  Democrats controlled all these cities and destroyed them with these socialist ideas and dependency societies that ruined Black America.
[01:49:08.530 --> 01:49:15.915]  They simply are using them because the game plan of the Marxists is to use different groups, pit them against each other to seize power.
[01:49:15.915 --> 01:49:20.838]  And unfortunately, I don't know that Black America even realizes how they've been used and played
[01:49:21.398 --> 01:49:30.683]  By Obama who is at the core he's not black he's red he's from the red Marxist groups and he's not one of them based on
[01:49:31.903 --> 01:49:35.767]  Not doing anything for the black community and simply using them to keep power.
[01:49:35.767 --> 01:49:36.808]  Well, it's ridiculous.
[01:49:36.808 --> 01:49:40.451]  And you'll see him out there trying to act like, you know, he's just one of the American people.
[01:49:40.451 --> 01:49:43.113]  It's clear he is a true villain.
[01:49:43.113 --> 01:49:45.195]  We're going to break, but I want to start now.
[01:49:45.195 --> 01:49:50.860]  The parallels, the hypocrisy where they won't get into his background, but they're demonizing Ben Carson.
[01:49:51.721 --> 01:49:52.122]  Right.
[01:49:52.122 --> 01:49:57.847]  Look, I have legitimate questions about Ben Carson's background, just like I had about Obama's.
[01:49:57.847 --> 01:50:06.795]  You know, I wonder why, if Carson tried to murder his mother, murder a friend, and hit someone over the head with a lock, what happened?
[01:50:06.795 --> 01:50:07.576]  What's his story?
[01:50:07.576 --> 01:50:10.098]  I don't think Donald Trump's questions are outrageous.
[01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:16.482]  I would think you don't get cured from that attempted murder by reading the Bible.
[01:50:16.482 --> 01:50:25.226]  I'm assuming he probably was put on some kind of psychotropic drugs, I think is a good, whether that took place or not as a child, whether he's still on them now.
[01:50:25.226 --> 01:50:26.947]  Those are legitimate questions.
[01:50:26.947 --> 01:50:29.208]  For Obama, we have legitimate questions.
[01:50:29.208 --> 01:50:31.389]  When did you stop doing cocaine and
[01:50:32.296 --> 01:50:34.377]  Marijuana like you did in your youth.
[01:50:34.377 --> 01:50:34.797]  Stay there!
[01:50:34.797 --> 01:50:36.318]  Let's come back and get into the press.
[01:50:36.318 --> 01:50:37.939]  Not investigating Obama.
[01:50:37.939 --> 01:50:39.340]  Joel Gilbert.
[01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:40.640]  Joel Gilbert.net.
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:44.522]  He also has the sites dealing with who Obama's real father is.
[01:50:44.522 --> 01:50:47.824]  If you don't get the film, Dreams of My Real Father, you're crazy.
[01:50:47.824 --> 01:50:49.184]  I know most of you have already seen it.
[01:50:49.184 --> 01:50:51.546]  Your friends and family, they need to see it.
[01:50:51.546 --> 01:50:53.427]  This is one film that wakes up liberals.
[01:50:53.427 --> 01:50:55.588]  They see it and they cannot believe it.
[01:50:55.588 --> 01:50:56.228]  It's incredible.

[01:52:23.424 --> 01:52:25.766]  My name is Jonathan Wright, and I'm 40 years old.
[01:52:25.766 --> 01:52:28.629]  I recently went from a desk job to a manual labor job.
[01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:29.750]  Normally, I'm worn out.
[01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:35.535]  With Energy Enhanced One World Way, I now recover so quickly that I can perform very hard work all day long.
[01:52:35.535 --> 01:52:40.920]  I use Energy Enhanced One World Way for breakfast and lunch, and I experience less hunger throughout the day.
[01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:44.023]  I have a 30% increase in energy, and I just feel better.
[01:52:44.023 --> 01:52:47.306]  I plan to make Energy Enhanced One World Way a permanent part of my lifestyle.

[01:53:55.761 --> 01:54:08.926]  It was a few months ago that I was downtown having dinner with my cousin Buckley Hammond and his wife.
[01:54:22.717 --> 01:54:43.535]  I heard shouting outside on Congress, so I went out there and there were about 300 people with red flags, hammers and sickles, Black Lives Matter, Kill the Pigs signs, Only Good Pigs a Dead Pig, and Muslim women and men, women with their faces covered, marching, who were Muslim women.
[01:54:43.535 --> 01:54:45.377]  And there were women with feminist signs too.
[01:54:48.263 --> 01:54:49.244]  And we have video of that.
[01:54:49.244 --> 01:54:54.246]  I think the headline was Communist Flags at Black Lives Matter Protest.
[01:54:54.246 --> 01:54:55.826]  Austin is the name of the video.
[01:54:55.826 --> 01:54:58.628]  If memory serves, it's on YouTube.
[01:54:58.628 --> 01:55:02.469]  Buckley ran outside with me and we shot it on his iPhone.
[01:55:02.469 --> 01:55:10.253]  And don't those, quote, feminist Marxists know that if the radical Islamists took over, they wouldn't be able to leave the house and wear hoods over their heads?
[01:55:11.141 --> 01:55:13.823]  I mean, they don't let Muslim women demonstrate in places like Saudi Arabia.
[01:55:13.823 --> 01:55:24.611]  I just don't get how you come here, and you hate it, or you get a free university education, as we found out a bunch of these people were getting, and it's just bizarre.
[01:55:24.611 --> 01:55:25.432]  Yeah, there's the footage.
[01:55:26.192 --> 01:55:29.435]  And then you can go to the front of it and see the red flags, the communists leading it.
[01:55:29.435 --> 01:55:43.409]  And the very same communists then came out to our pro-life demonstration, then began screaming, we love the devil, we love being ugly, we have hair under our arms, you right-wingers are gonna get it, and yes, we kill our babies, and sticking their tongues out.
[01:55:43.409 --> 01:55:46.252]  And you think, what is wrong with these people?
[01:55:46.252 --> 01:55:48.554]  And, they're just crazy!
[01:55:49.417 --> 01:56:17.018]  Now I want to, we have five more minutes now and five minutes to the next segment and Joel Gilbert's got to go ahead of other guests joining us but Joel I know I was getting into the parallels between the way they treat Carson and the way they treat Obama and his background but again just getting back to these spoiled rotten kids normally of wealthy middle-class people running around wanting to live under radical Islam slash communism these people need I mean really need to be punched in the nose and I'm sorry to talk like that but they're not living in the real world
[01:56:18.220 --> 01:56:31.604]  Well, they live in an alternate reality that the President of the United States lives in and propagates every day through the tools of state, through the IRS, through the Josh Earnest, through their media allies.
[01:56:31.604 --> 01:56:43.187]  They're creating this alternate reality that people who were adults in the 60s, I was, you know, just a little kid, but they remember this same kind of anti-police, anti-government, anti-American rhetoric
[01:56:43.992 --> 01:56:49.217]  Uh, that they thought would lead to a takeover of the United States and the creation of this paradise on Earth.
[01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:53.262]  Conservatives and radicals see the world differently.
[01:56:53.262 --> 01:56:58.724]  We look at America and we say, America is the greatest country in the world compared to everywhere else.
[01:56:58.724 --> 01:57:00.385]  This is as good as it gets.
[01:57:00.385 --> 01:57:02.826]  It's not perfect, but we love America.
[01:57:02.826 --> 01:57:08.990]  Leftists and radicals compare America to a socialist utopia, a paradise.
[01:57:08.990 --> 01:57:15.173]  And they say it doesn't measure up to paradise, so we have to tear it down, destroy it, and try to build a paradise on earth.
[01:57:15.173 --> 01:57:17.254]  And that's the difference in thinking.
[01:57:17.254 --> 01:57:19.475]  Finishing up in the few minutes we have left in the next segment,
[01:57:20.865 --> 01:57:24.868]  They still worship Obama even though he screwed him over?
[01:57:24.868 --> 01:57:26.749]  Unfortunately, he's got a hold on them.
[01:57:26.749 --> 01:57:34.254]  I think if you look at my film, There's No Place Like Utopia, I do talk to a lot of African Americans in Detroit, Chicago, all over the country.
[01:57:34.254 --> 01:57:39.498]  And the first thing they'll tell me is, you know, Republicans are racist, Obama, they love Obama.
[01:57:39.498 --> 01:57:42.780]  But after I talked to him for about two minutes, it didn't take two minutes,
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:53.343]  Until they all were like, well wait a minute, we don't want our kids smoking marijuana, we don't want illegals coming and taking our jobs, we don't want any of this radical nonsense agenda.
[01:57:53.343 --> 01:57:55.584]  We're religious people, we believe in God.
[01:57:55.584 --> 01:58:07.547]  So, once you dialogue with them, and I hope that's what Republican candidates will do, it's pretty easy to see that some of the biggest conservatives in America today are African Americans that have been living in the Democratic hellholes.
[01:58:09.215 --> 01:58:12.157]  Well, also Hispanics, two-thirds, don't want open borders.
[01:58:12.157 --> 01:58:12.598]  No kidding.
[01:58:12.598 --> 01:58:15.240]  They're more conservative than the average dumb white yuppie.
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:16.901]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:58:16.901 --> 01:58:19.943]  But the Republicans won't communicate that to them.
[01:58:19.943 --> 01:58:24.327]  They just sit there and act like the fake liberal view of the world is reality.
[01:58:24.327 --> 01:58:26.889]  Well, I think, hopefully, it'll turn around.
[01:58:26.889 --> 01:58:31.573]  There are some presidential candidates that I think can take the argument all over the country.
[01:58:31.573 --> 01:58:33.434]  I want to see who you like.
[01:58:33.434 --> 01:58:35.035]  Back in 70 seconds, Joel Gilbert.
[01:58:35.035 --> 01:58:37.417]  And more of the Obama above the law garbage.
[01:58:37.417 --> 01:58:38.478]  The media won't look into the background.
[01:58:41.218 --> 01:58:45.190]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:48.382 --> 01:58:51.904]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:58:51.904 --> 01:59:00.147]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:59:00.147 --> 01:59:05.569]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:59:05.569 --> 01:59:08.090]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:59:08.090 --> 01:59:10.191]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:59:18.331 --> 01:59:19.452]  BrainForce is here.
[01:59:19.452 --> 01:59:21.653]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:59:21.653 --> 01:59:26.636]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:59:26.636 --> 01:59:28.336]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[01:59:28.336 --> 01:59:29.937]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:59:29.937 --> 01:59:33.419]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:59:33.419 --> 01:59:35.400]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:36.321]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[01:59:36.321 --> 01:59:37.521]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:59:37.521 --> 01:59:39.522]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:59:39.522 --> 01:59:45.105]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:59:51.029 --> 01:59:53.640]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:04.642 --> 02:00:09.486]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.486 --> 02:00:11.068]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.068 --> 02:00:12.609]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.609 --> 02:00:16.813]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.813 --> 02:00:22.457]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.457 --> 02:00:27.121]  Steve Quayle's coming on to give us his take on the Islamic Jihad expansion.
[02:00:28.468 --> 02:00:31.070]  Dr. Steve Pchenik also will be popping in.
[02:00:31.070 --> 02:00:33.612]  David Knight hosts the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[02:00:33.612 --> 02:00:34.813]  Joel Gilbert finishing up.
[02:00:34.813 --> 02:00:36.555]  You got interrupted by the break.
[02:00:36.555 --> 02:00:40.138]  Other key points you'd like to relay to folks in the time we have left together?
[02:00:40.138 --> 02:00:54.230]  Yeah, going back to Obama's biography, I want to point to Obama writing in his book that when push comes to shove, after 9-11, he said, when push comes to shove between Americans and Muslims, I will stand with the Muslims.
[02:00:54.912 --> 02:00:56.754]  He made this very clear.
[02:00:56.754 --> 02:01:01.578]  His book is a partial roadmap to understanding his policies.
[02:01:01.578 --> 02:01:13.348]  The parts that are hidden, which I've exposed in Dreams from My Real Father, his real biological father, who was his ideological mentor throughout his life, was the radical communist Frank Marshall Davis.
[02:01:13.348 --> 02:01:16.931]  He was anti-white, anti-American, pro-Soviet.
[02:01:16.931 --> 02:01:19.273]  Obama's pro-Russian policies.
[02:01:19.273 --> 02:01:21.195]  Everything can be tied to Frank Marshall Davis.
[02:01:21.195 --> 02:01:22.636]  I encourage everyone to look at it.
[02:01:23.716 --> 02:01:33.167]  Um, and, uh, as I said, Ben Carson does deserve scrutiny, but the media should have gone out to Hawaii like I did twice and looked into Obama's background.
[02:01:33.167 --> 02:01:42.098]  And I think I put together a, uh, comprehensive view of what his real politics are based on his real history, who he is and his DNA as an American radical.
[02:01:44.773 --> 02:01:46.154]  Now, you speak about Russia.
[02:01:46.154 --> 02:01:48.235]  This may be an area we disagree some on.
[02:01:48.235 --> 02:02:00.803]  I mean, I see Russia getting out of the clutches to a great extent of Marxism, promoting Christianity, family, not really even expanding its borders, and really starting to attack ISIS, which Obama should be doing.
[02:02:00.803 --> 02:02:07.267]  I understand that Obama was pro-Soviet and has even made such statements, but do you think this is all the Russians playing possum right now?
[02:02:08.223 --> 02:02:13.436]  I think the Russians have an agenda in the Mediterranean, in the Black Sea area and in
[02:02:15.256 --> 02:02:18.478]  You know, Eastern Mediterranean, they want to re-establish their bases there.
[02:02:18.478 --> 02:02:20.399]  They intend to prop up Assad.
[02:02:20.399 --> 02:02:22.620]  The goal is not to defeat ISIS.
[02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:36.687]  That's the excuse for them to enter the area and create another presence in that region, knowing that the United States has withdrawn and has no interest in influencing the region and is leaving our ally Israel on its own.
[02:02:36.687 --> 02:02:41.350]  So they have their own agenda, which I think they're using the ISIS excuse to execute.
[02:02:44.215 --> 02:02:50.610]  But I don't see Russia today as the fount of collectivism and communism and corruption.
[02:02:50.610 --> 02:02:53.997]  I see Europe and the United States and Communist China as the fount.
[02:02:55.228 --> 02:03:04.933]  I think Russia is still a, even though it's not Marxist in nature, it is a bastion of anti-Americanism that it carried over from the Soviet era.
[02:03:04.933 --> 02:03:13.897]  And they will oppose our interests, oppose our allies, support enemies of our allies, and try to cut America off from our natural allies in Western Europe.
[02:03:13.897 --> 02:03:15.778]  The United States cannot exist as a
[02:03:16.838 --> 02:03:19.119]  You know, lone democracy between two oceans.
[02:03:19.119 --> 02:03:40.229]  We have to have strong democratic allies in Europe, Israel, Japan, Australia, and Russia, I think, will seek to, along with China, will seek to neutralize those alliances because of the geography, oil, for any number of reasons, to continue to isolate the United States so they can dominate us both militarily but economically.
[02:03:40.969 --> 02:03:45.273]  They want the dollar not to be the standard currency for the world.
[02:03:45.273 --> 02:03:48.356]  Sure, and our leaders devaluing it are opening the door for that, but you're right.
[02:03:48.356 --> 02:04:05.730]  The Chinese and others just got entrance into the world reserve currency market, and you can see the bricks and the rest of it lining up against the United States right now, and you can see really a schizophrenic policy where they do some things that are good for the U.S., other things that aren't.
[02:04:05.730 --> 02:04:08.593]  One thing's for sure, this is a very interesting time to be alive, Joel Gilbert.
[02:04:09.417 --> 02:04:12.578]  Well, it's interesting, but it's also fraught with danger.
[02:04:12.578 --> 02:04:21.342]  The United States must lead and dominate the world for peace to be maintained and for our interests to be maintained and the security of our allies.
[02:04:21.342 --> 02:04:27.484]  As long as Barack Obama is in office, the United States remains in grave danger.
[02:04:27.484 --> 02:04:28.264]  Well, I know this.
[02:04:28.264 --> 02:04:31.786]  They say their number one terror threat is conservatives and libertarians and veterans.
[02:04:32.893 --> 02:04:38.315]  But it's not a threat to bring in unlimited people from war-torn areas full of jihadis.
[02:04:38.315 --> 02:04:42.477]  It does show a real disconnect, and I'm just trying to understand the ideology that's so self-destructive.
[02:04:42.477 --> 02:04:44.578]  I mean, these elites run America.
[02:04:44.578 --> 02:04:46.659]  Why would they want to tear it to pieces?
[02:04:46.659 --> 02:04:48.340]  It's self-destructive.
[02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:50.521]  Joel Gilbert, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:04:50.521 --> 02:04:51.661]  Thanks for having me today.
[02:04:51.661 --> 02:04:53.162]  We'll be back with Steve Quayle.
[02:04:53.162 --> 02:04:55.843]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:04:58.750 --> 02:05:06.034]  A man has filed a lawsuit against his landlord over the right to have a firearm in his apartment, reports Guns.com.
[02:05:06.034 --> 02:05:11.718]  Harvey Limbo's apartment was targeted a total of five times before he purchased a handgun.
[02:05:11.718 --> 02:05:19.903]  Limbo, who suffers from diabetes, degenerative heart disease and chronic pain, believes burglars targeted his home searching for prescription pills.
[02:05:19.903 --> 02:05:25.326]  And less than 12 hours after he purchased his gun, he was met face-to-face with one of those burglars.
[02:05:25.706 --> 02:05:34.612]  Limbo was sleeping with his newly purchased gun under his pillow and was awakened around midnight and saw a shadowy figure pass from the kitchen into the living room.
[02:05:34.612 --> 02:05:42.057]  The thief was found sifting through prescription pills, so Limbo trained his gun on the intruder and warned him not to move as he called 911.
[02:05:42.057 --> 02:05:44.999]  The thief did move, however, and was shot in the shoulder.
[02:05:44.999 --> 02:05:52.104]  Days later, Limbo was contacted by Stanford Management Company with a reminder that he agreed not to have a firearm in his home.
[02:05:52.104 --> 02:05:55.566]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[02:05:58.306 --> 02:05:59.247]  Alex Jones here.

[02:07:01.477 --> 02:07:11.224]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:07:11.224 --> 02:07:13.926]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:07:13.926 --> 02:07:17.489]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:07:17.489 --> 02:07:23.813]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[02:07:23.813 --> 02:07:28.657]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:07:28.937 --> 02:07:35.319]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[02:07:35.319 --> 02:07:43.041]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[02:07:43.041 --> 02:07:50.584]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[02:08:19.437 --> 02:08:21.081]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:28.957 --> 02:08:30.959]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:08:30.959 --> 02:08:33.021]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:08:33.021 --> 02:08:36.523]  Steve Quayle is one of the original founders of the PrEP movement.
[02:08:36.523 --> 02:08:39.046]  He's been on talk radio more than 20 years now.
[02:08:39.046 --> 02:08:42.889]  He's a best-selling author, stevequayle.com.
[02:08:42.889 --> 02:08:45.571]  And I wanted to get him to pop in for two segments today.
[02:08:45.571 --> 02:08:55.439]  We appreciate him doing that to give his take and his analysis from his research and his sources on what this signifies with the West bringing in
[02:08:56.420 --> 02:08:58.682]  Millions of refugees into Europe.
[02:08:58.682 --> 02:09:00.163]  First Obama said 10,000.
[02:09:00.163 --> 02:09:08.489]  Now it's 100,000 plus refugees into the United States with fake passports, the majority of them.
[02:09:08.489 --> 02:09:10.930]  Undoubtedly, this is sleeper cells being brought in.
[02:09:10.930 --> 02:09:12.772]  Undoubtedly, they know terror attacks are coming.
[02:09:12.772 --> 02:09:13.892]  We've already seen a bunch of them.
[02:09:15.013 --> 02:09:17.398]  What is the end game of this?
[02:09:17.398 --> 02:09:23.608]  And how do the politicians think they're going to get away with allowing these attacks to take place?
[02:09:23.608 --> 02:09:25.652]  That's what I wanted to get Steve Quayle's take on.
[02:09:25.652 --> 02:09:27.375]  Steve Quayle, thanks for joining us.
[02:09:27.375 --> 02:09:28.397]  What do you think's going on here?
[02:09:29.127 --> 02:09:29.948]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:09:29.948 --> 02:09:37.154]  I think this is the integration of the ultimate, luminous, globalist plan for global war and global civil war.
[02:09:37.154 --> 02:09:45.681]  Civil war meaning in all nations that we're seeing, whether it's Europe, whether it's parts of Asia and the United States, we're being set up for the ultimate
[02:09:46.241 --> 02:09:47.162]  We're good to go.
[02:10:02.769 --> 02:10:10.094]  Is the longer they wait, once people start being, the first shots are fired, the more danger it puts a hostage in.
[02:10:10.094 --> 02:10:14.377]  You've got to ask yourself, why did they not rush the building?
[02:10:14.377 --> 02:10:20.001]  Why did they allow it to go on, even when people were texting and phoning out of the building?
[02:10:20.001 --> 02:10:22.083]  I think that this is the cause.
[02:10:22.083 --> 02:10:26.586]  As you probably know Alex, the French Foreign Legion now is boots on the ground in Syria.
[02:10:27.627 --> 02:10:33.811]  It's becoming more and more obvious that the issue, the major issue, is simply this.
[02:10:33.811 --> 02:10:35.653]  This is not immigration.
[02:10:35.653 --> 02:10:37.434]  This is invasion.
[02:10:37.434 --> 02:10:49.203]  The pathetic excuse of the entity in the White House when he said that ISIS was contained and then boom, and then the other statement that he made through his press conference in Turkey should be absolute.
[02:10:49.203 --> 02:10:55.628]  A declaration that he is overseeing and allowing the Islamic invasion of the United States
[02:10:56.188 --> 02:10:59.470]  And basically funding it in other parts of the world.
[02:10:59.470 --> 02:11:03.492]  You know, that's what Vladimir Putin... Putin spoke the most telling and compelling statement.
[02:11:03.492 --> 02:11:05.654]  He said, look what you have done.
[02:11:05.654 --> 02:11:09.896]  But I don't think people understand this is not by accident.
[02:11:09.896 --> 02:11:13.918]  And this is not by someone who is so removed from reality.
[02:11:13.918 --> 02:11:15.599]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[02:11:15.599 --> 02:11:21.723]  He knows that there must be a war that has to take place for Islamic eschatology to be fulfilled.
[02:11:22.123 --> 02:11:23.124]  A global nuclear war.
[02:11:23.124 --> 02:11:33.835]  You remember you and I did a show together when Amandine and Job made the statement that for the sake of the return of the Mahdi, it'd be beneficial for 54 million Iranians if they had to die to bring it about?
[02:11:33.835 --> 02:11:39.620]  Well, he got thrown out because there must have been more than one who said, we don't want this guy present anymore.
[02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:44.885]  But the point is, is that with Balalai and McElhenney and others,
[02:11:45.606 --> 02:11:47.487]  I'm calling now saying something's wrong.
[02:11:47.487 --> 02:11:53.230]  We have a constitutional definition of treason, aiding and abetting a sworn enemy of the United States.
[02:11:53.230 --> 02:12:09.100]  We have denial upon denial upon denial, but Alex, I propose to you that all the weapons you and I have talked about, all of the ammunition that has been purchased has been secreted away in different places throughout the United States and will be for the invading army
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.683]  I think Alex, we are under invasion.
[02:12:12.683 --> 02:12:26.433]  This is not immigration and the threats of ISIS and let's just face it, you and I have talked so many years that terrorism is nothing more than an extension of someone's foreign policy, in this case the terrorists,
[02:12:26.853 --> 02:12:43.804]  And the overthrow of the Old World Order, we've heard it from George Bush, ad nauseam, and the point being now is we're seeing implementation and unfortunately, with the veterans being killed off, 350,000 plus, denial of medical services, etc.
[02:12:43.804 --> 02:12:53.130]  since Obama came to office, now 900,000 plus veterans waiting, it's got to be obvious to everybody that we're seeing the decimation of the U.S.
[02:12:53.130 --> 02:12:55.912]  military, we're seeing the, if you will,
[02:12:56.232 --> 02:13:00.114]  Throwing the Americans under the bus, and it's a war.
[02:13:00.114 --> 02:13:01.595]  It's civil war.
[02:13:01.595 --> 02:13:06.158]  When you see that the statements out of Obama... Look, you don't need to make anything up.
[02:13:06.158 --> 02:13:10.920]  You don't need to go in long-winded television network.
[02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:15.623]  Not that you do, but the television networks, they're trying to figure everything out, and it's so obvious.
[02:13:15.623 --> 02:13:24.208]  And one of the things about people is that they're so numbed and dumbed down to reality, they can't get out of their entertainment, if you will,
[02:13:25.148 --> 02:13:31.070]  Uh, uh, paradigm and come to reality knowing that this is the beginning of the end.
[02:13:31.070 --> 02:13:45.855]  And I'm, you know, you and I, we used to do talk radio together years and years ago, actually decades, but it was always tough for people to come to the conclusion that the United States would still be standing because there were enough patriots, enough gun owners, enough of this, enough of that.
[02:13:45.855 --> 02:13:49.176]  But unfortunately, the people that should have stood up didn't.
[02:13:49.176 --> 02:13:52.097]  The people that even now should stand up won't.
[02:13:52.097 --> 02:13:53.918]  And Alex, I was going to ask you a question today.
[02:13:54.358 --> 02:14:01.684]  How many people in the United States, all your listeners, our listeners, all the listeners that get it, have you ever tried to put a number on that?
[02:14:01.684 --> 02:14:03.485]  Realistically put a number on it?
[02:14:03.485 --> 02:14:05.486]  Of hardcore people in the U.S.
[02:14:05.486 --> 02:14:11.711]  that are really awake and tune into my show, maybe, maybe 10 million.
[02:14:12.637 --> 02:14:18.263]  Okay, and the thing is, I was going to say somewhere between 3 and 7, okay?
[02:14:18.263 --> 02:14:22.248]  So 3 and 7 is still close to 2% of the world's population.
[02:14:22.248 --> 02:14:33.660]  How is it, I'm not world's population, US population, how is it with that many people in the know, are we still electing or are the traders being elected?
[02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:35.221]  Well, they just don't know what to do.
[02:14:35.221 --> 02:14:40.022]  Just like you and I, we know what's happening, but we sit here peacefully trying to warn people.
[02:14:40.022 --> 02:14:47.986]  I mean, look at the IRS persecuting and arresting and going after more than 10,000 organizations.
[02:14:47.986 --> 02:14:49.666]  They admit have done nothing.
[02:14:49.666 --> 02:14:53.288]  Veterans groups, gun groups, Christian groups, and we put up with that.
[02:14:53.948 --> 02:14:55.789]  And I ask myself, have I done enough?
[02:14:55.789 --> 02:14:58.330]  I mean, is there some physical line in the sand?
[02:14:58.330 --> 02:15:01.671]  But then I realize, if we get physical, they'll spend that.
[02:15:01.671 --> 02:15:05.292]  But at a certain point, it's just so out of control.
[02:15:05.292 --> 02:15:13.895]  When the Border Patrol is on TV saying, we've been ordered secretly to smuggle illegals in, we complete the smuggling process.
[02:15:13.895 --> 02:15:15.275]  This is treason.
[02:15:15.275 --> 02:15:16.776]  This is an occupied government.
[02:15:17.515 --> 02:15:18.335]  It is treason.
[02:15:18.335 --> 02:15:20.556]  So we are a nation under occupation.
[02:15:20.556 --> 02:15:28.138]  I woke up the other morning, I think yesterday, or the day before, and the bottom line of these words just kept ringing in my ears.
[02:15:28.138 --> 02:15:33.620]  I, you know, got up, walked around, went back to bed, and it basically was just a simple statement.
[02:15:34.406 --> 02:15:37.491]  America, you will lose everything.
[02:15:37.491 --> 02:15:40.254]  And so the point is, is our freedoms are pretty well gone.
[02:15:40.254 --> 02:15:42.357]  You and I can quote the Declaration.
[02:15:42.357 --> 02:15:43.599]  We can quote the Constitution.
[02:15:43.599 --> 02:15:44.841]  We can carry a pop constitution.
[02:15:44.841 --> 02:15:48.526]  The last thing they're going to take away is the chicken feed and the entertainment.
[02:15:48.526 --> 02:15:51.290]  And when they take all the little baubles and chicken feet away...
[02:15:51.690 --> 02:15:54.312]  What are the giant masses of trendies going to do?
[02:15:54.312 --> 02:15:59.935]  They're going to say to the government in Hollywood, we'll do anything you say, just give us chicken feet again.
[02:15:59.935 --> 02:16:04.897]  And they'll say, okay, go along with arresting the Christians, the patriots, and the veterans.
[02:16:04.897 --> 02:16:09.640]  And the giant masses of scum will call for the 10% of us to be arrested.
[02:16:10.467 --> 02:16:13.128]  Absolutely, and they won't be happy with the arrest.
[02:16:13.128 --> 02:16:19.590]  You know, it's always been like, look, if you compare the contemporary presidency with the reign of Nero, okay?
[02:16:19.590 --> 02:16:28.814]  Obviously, they didn't have 18 whole golf courses in Nero's day, and maybe he would have been out on the course putting instead of, you know, fiddling or whatever he was doing.
[02:16:28.814 --> 02:16:31.695]  Well, he did have a palace the size of a golf course.
[02:16:31.695 --> 02:16:32.935]  Yeah, you got it.
[02:16:32.935 --> 02:16:37.357]  And the point is that we're now in the bull's eye.
[02:16:37.357 --> 02:16:39.078]  It's where the Coliseum is today.
[02:16:39.078 --> 02:16:39.578]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:16:40.168 --> 02:16:48.692]  Yeah, we're to the point right now where we are under full-scale identification by the powers that be for destruction.
[02:16:48.692 --> 02:16:53.354]  I was made this statement for 25 years and I'm only saying it in retrospect.
[02:16:53.354 --> 02:17:00.758]  When it comes time to kill the Christians, when it comes time to kill the Patriots, when it comes time it will be done during rock concerts,
[02:17:01.318 --> 02:17:05.921]  Uh, the band of the day will be on the stage and the guillotines will be chopping away.
[02:17:05.921 --> 02:17:10.343]  Instead of that, people would prefer to basically just say, oh, don't bother me.
[02:17:10.343 --> 02:17:11.384]  I know people, Alex.
[02:17:11.384 --> 02:17:12.364]  You know people.
[02:17:12.364 --> 02:17:14.805]  We probably know more people that have the attitude.
[02:17:14.805 --> 02:17:19.988]  I don't want to, to quote Barbara Bush, uh, clutter my beautiful mind.
[02:17:19.988 --> 02:17:22.129]  Well, it's one thing to clutter your beautiful mind.
[02:17:22.129 --> 02:17:24.391]  It's another thing to have your life taken from you.
[02:17:24.391 --> 02:17:26.732]  It's another thing to have your family robbed from you.
[02:17:26.732 --> 02:17:28.673]  It's another thing to have your children taken from you.
[02:17:28.673 --> 02:17:30.434]  And these people are monsters.
[02:17:30.934 --> 02:17:36.478]  Alex, that's the thing that has got to be first and foremost in everyone's mind.
[02:17:36.478 --> 02:17:38.720]  These people are monsters.
[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:44.104]  That's right, and good people can't get their minds around that there are monstrous other individuals out there.
[02:17:44.104 --> 02:17:47.607]  Steve, you've been coming on the show for 20 years, almost 21.
[02:17:47.607 --> 02:17:51.210]  You are on fire today, like I've never heard you, totally focused.
[02:17:51.210 --> 02:17:53.812]  Why, is it just in your gut that stuff's more imminent than ever?
[02:17:54.912 --> 02:17:56.653]  Tough is more eminent than ever.
[02:17:56.653 --> 02:18:09.498]  When I saw the lack of reaction to the, by the powers that be, and now seeing the President of, you know, France putting boots on the ground, the French Foreign Legion in Syria.
[02:18:09.498 --> 02:18:15.200]  It's, everybody in the G20 is in on this, and this is the hard thing for people to understand.
[02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:21.202]  You know the first one to suffer in any war, first thing to suffer is truth, obviously, but the second thing to suffer are the innocents.
[02:18:21.742 --> 02:18:29.750]  And with the war that is against us, and ISIS, and Syria, and military age people coming against us.
[02:18:29.750 --> 02:18:31.712]  Alex, I want to go on record on your show today.
[02:18:31.712 --> 02:18:33.714]  Look, we are under attack.
[02:18:33.714 --> 02:18:34.675]  We are at war.
[02:18:34.675 --> 02:18:35.716]  They're coming to kill us.
[02:18:36.181 --> 02:18:40.845]  We can no longer, and look, here's everybody's line in the sand.
[02:18:40.845 --> 02:18:53.114]  If under whatever directive, decree, or pronouncement, guns are to be turned in, then I'm telling you this, people know that that will not apply to all the terrorist training camps.
[02:18:53.414 --> 02:18:57.636]  It will not apply to the strategic placement of foreign troops.
[02:18:57.636 --> 02:18:58.816]  Look, you know all the flack.
[02:18:58.816 --> 02:19:00.617]  You got, I got, we got.
[02:19:00.617 --> 02:19:02.898]  When we were saying, hey, there are Russians in this country.
[02:19:02.898 --> 02:19:04.658]  Hey, there are Chinese in this country.
[02:19:04.658 --> 02:19:05.639]  Hey, they're in Canada.
[02:19:05.639 --> 02:19:06.979]  Hey, they're in Mexico.
[02:19:06.979 --> 02:19:08.800]  And guess what?
[02:19:08.800 --> 02:19:19.544]  The horses, or the donkeys, just basically used the hey, I'm talking about, H-E-Y, and went on chewing their cud, the H-A-Y, because, again,
[02:19:20.064 --> 02:19:24.248]  People will not move in anticipation of evil.
[02:19:24.248 --> 02:19:25.769]  They only respond to it.
[02:19:25.769 --> 02:19:28.031]  What I would recommend, hey, non-violence.
[02:19:28.031 --> 02:19:33.836]  Every single person that's voting for gun control immediately have recall petitions, okay?
[02:19:33.836 --> 02:19:35.258]  And look at what Texas governor did.
[02:19:35.258 --> 02:19:38.080]  He just stood up and said, uh-uh, we're not taking the refugees.
[02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:40.903]  Unfortunately, Montana's governor is not
[02:19:41.703 --> 02:19:52.375]  Uh, you know, bold enough to do that, yes, but I don't think Montana's gonna sit back and let, uh, 4,000 Syrian terrorists coming, uh, come into Boise, Idaho, and come into Montana.
[02:19:52.375 --> 02:19:57.560]  It's crazy, because we know these aren't the real Syrian refugees, these are the jihadis fleeing to Europe and the U.S.

[02:23:58.852 --> 02:23:59.293]  I think so.
[02:24:17.677 --> 02:24:22.300]  By the way, coming up at the start of the next segment, it's on Reuters, Associated Press, you name it.
[02:24:22.300 --> 02:24:26.142]  DOJ to announce actions against dietary supplement makers nationwide.
[02:24:26.142 --> 02:24:28.763]  Nutritional stocks crater.
[02:24:28.763 --> 02:24:33.266]  We told you they're coming after vitamins, minerals, you name it.
[02:24:33.266 --> 02:24:35.607]  And guess who else is involved?
[02:24:35.607 --> 02:24:39.470]  It says in the article, the Pentagon.
[02:24:39.470 --> 02:24:40.410]  The Pentagon.
[02:24:40.410 --> 02:24:41.711]  Never heard of that before, have you?
[02:24:43.285 --> 02:24:43.765]  The U.S.
[02:24:43.765 --> 02:24:47.288]  Food and Drug Administration, DOJ, U.S.
[02:24:47.288 --> 02:24:54.012]  Postal Inspection Service, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Defense, and others.
[02:24:54.012 --> 02:24:55.593]  I'll talk about this at the start of the next segment.
[02:24:55.593 --> 02:24:57.034]  Going back to Steve Quayle.
[02:24:57.034 --> 02:24:58.395]  Steve, across the board.
[02:24:59.721 --> 02:25:07.626]  They have now announced in Congress and at the FCC that indeed they are looking at quote, restricting Matt Drudge's free speech by name.
[02:25:07.626 --> 02:25:09.868]  That means that they can get Drudge and everybody else.
[02:25:09.868 --> 02:25:15.231]  It doesn't matter if it's the Second Amendment, the First Amendment, the right to supplements, they're dropping the hammer.
[02:25:15.231 --> 02:25:19.054]  I mean, every sign is the big storm is coming, Steve Quayle.
[02:25:19.972 --> 02:25:21.092]  It's here, Alex.
[02:25:21.092 --> 02:25:30.776]  You know, when Matt Dredge was on your show, and obviously the whole outcome of that when he said it's been a good 20-year run, I don't think people understand.
[02:25:30.776 --> 02:25:31.757]  Let me make it easy.
[02:25:31.757 --> 02:25:33.377]  Let me make it really easy.
[02:25:33.377 --> 02:25:35.258]  When your freedom dies, you're next.
[02:25:35.738 --> 02:25:36.799]  I don't think so.
[02:25:56.099 --> 02:25:56.400]  I don't
[02:26:11.136 --> 02:26:11.736]  We're good to go.
[02:26:28.383 --> 02:26:29.624]  We're good to go.
[02:26:52.632 --> 02:27:06.059]  Global war is getting ready to happen, and we've seen the most sophisticated weaponry in the world, both in... Well, most mainline analysts say they believe World War III or World War IV, because the Pentagon calls the last war Cold War, World War III.
[02:27:06.059 --> 02:27:07.720]  They say they believe it's going to happen.
[02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:11.742]  I hope that's not the case, but when so many mainline analysts agree with Steve Quayle, what's that mean?
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:22.634]  Well, it means that, you know, uh, it means that there comes a time when mocking the messenger will no longer prevent, uh, the ramification of the truth, okay?
[02:27:22.634 --> 02:27:27.200]  You know, the point is, is that these kiss-the-enemy's-posterior
[02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:30.441]  Let's just call it this.
[02:27:30.441 --> 02:27:33.542]  This is a complete communist revolution being taken over.
[02:27:33.542 --> 02:27:36.162]  It's being instigated and it's being overseen and funded.
[02:27:36.162 --> 02:27:41.884]  And when you've got the guy come on the screen and say, you know, America, I don't care if America wins anymore.
[02:27:41.884 --> 02:27:45.825]  Hey, hello, ladies and gentlemen, everybody, all those people out there.
[02:27:45.825 --> 02:27:49.146]  And it's not a question of we can't vote the right guy in, Alex.
[02:27:49.146 --> 02:27:51.006]  It's too late for that.
[02:27:51.006 --> 02:27:53.147]  I'm not a fatalist, but you know this.
[02:27:53.928 --> 02:27:55.170]  You've poured your heart out.
[02:27:55.170 --> 02:27:59.035]  You've poured everything that made Alex Jones Alex Jones.
[02:27:59.035 --> 02:28:00.297]  You've laid it, you know.
[02:28:00.297 --> 02:28:02.480]  Your energy level is exemplary.
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:04.403]  That's not flattery, that's just truth.
[02:28:04.403 --> 02:28:05.465]  But at the end of the day...
[02:28:06.428 --> 02:28:06.789]  I think?
[02:28:26.571 --> 02:28:34.578]  And I'm not kidding, if we're all eating baby parts and mutagenic substances in the food, I mean, they really, really do.
[02:28:34.578 --> 02:28:39.422]  They, being the globalists, the illuminists, the luciferians, consider all of us zombies.
[02:28:39.422 --> 02:28:40.463]  And you know what?
[02:28:40.463 --> 02:28:43.946]  Look at what people are doing and look at what they're not doing.
[02:28:44.366 --> 02:28:47.088]  You cannot stay as a spectator.
[02:28:47.088 --> 02:28:52.090]  This is one time where spectators will die first.
[02:28:52.090 --> 02:28:53.971]  Saying that, you've got two choices.
[02:28:53.971 --> 02:29:07.559]  You draw your line in the sand and you quit listening to the kiss-the-devil's-bottom people that just want to get along, have a group hug, sing kumbaya, and go to dead churches and dead pulpits that absolutely have no life.
[02:29:07.559 --> 02:29:08.059]  We are in
[02:29:08.459 --> 02:29:09.259]  They won't!
[02:29:36.411 --> 02:29:39.255]  Don't fight for anything because they've been turning to zombies first.
[02:29:39.255 --> 02:29:41.598]  The problem with the New World Order is we're not all zombies.
[02:29:41.598 --> 02:29:42.960]  Steve Quell, thank you so much.
[02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:44.161]  Powerful analysis.

[02:29:47.265 --> 02:29:47.545]  Thank you.
[02:29:47.545 --> 02:29:47.966]  God bless you.
[02:29:47.966 --> 02:29:49.328]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.328 --> 02:29:51.871]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.871 --> 02:29:54.555]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.590 --> 02:30:04.594]  Weapons have been reported stolen from a Massachusetts Army Reserve building, reports Fox News.
[02:30:04.594 --> 02:30:10.978]  Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker confirmed the burglary at a Statehouse press conference this past weekend.
[02:30:10.978 --> 02:30:19.243]  State officials have ordered security stepped up at sites around the state after Friday's terror attack in Paris that killed well over 100 people.
[02:30:19.243 --> 02:30:22.946]  It was not immediately clear how many or what type of weapons were taken.
[02:30:23.246 --> 02:30:29.510]  An FBI spokeswoman said that the agency had no indication that the missing weapons were connected to terrorism.
[02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:38.076]  She said, we have entered those weapons into NCIC, a national database, and alerted our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners.
[02:30:38.076 --> 02:30:45.101]  We are collaborating with the Massachusetts State Police, Worcester Police, and others to locate and recover these weapons immediately.
[02:30:45.901 --> 02:30:52.786]  WFXT reported that evidence response resources were at the facility this weekend investigating the break-in.
[02:30:52.786 --> 02:30:58.470]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[02:33:15.359 --> 02:33:17.480]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:17.480 --> 02:33:26.884]  We're going to get Dr. Steve Pachinik of stevepachinik.com's take on the situation with the terror attacks.
[02:33:26.884 --> 02:33:27.484]  Are they real?
[02:33:27.484 --> 02:33:28.264]  Are they a false flag?
[02:33:28.264 --> 02:33:31.986]  I respect his opinion, his view, his sources are amazing.
[02:33:31.986 --> 02:33:35.327]  He formerly headed up a lot of the anti-terrorism operations at the State Department.
[02:33:35.327 --> 02:33:36.348]  He also ran PSYOPs.
[02:33:37.108 --> 02:33:40.349]  One of the first big things he did was the Camp David Accords.
[02:33:40.349 --> 02:33:43.371]  They admit he was the main psychiatrist on all that.
[02:33:43.371 --> 02:33:45.331]  And helped get that accord signed.
[02:33:45.331 --> 02:33:47.712]  Co-wrote a bunch of books with Tom Clancy and others.
[02:33:47.712 --> 02:33:49.693]  Ran special ops operations.
[02:33:49.693 --> 02:33:52.314]  Was involved in the founding of Delta Force and more.
[02:33:52.314 --> 02:33:54.355]  A frequent guest here, so we need to introduce him.
[02:33:54.355 --> 02:33:57.456]  We'll be talking to him here in a moment about his take on the situation.
[02:33:57.456 --> 02:33:59.677]  And in the fourth hour, David Knight takes over.
[02:33:59.677 --> 02:34:03.559]  He'll be taking calls, has some special guests, and more today.
[02:34:05.103 --> 02:34:19.985]  I don't expect this to be about us, though I was told a few months ago by high-level sources that coming in late November, December, that I was part of a DOJ investigation into supplements, which is basically unprecedented.
[02:34:20.706 --> 02:34:27.973]  Now, everything we put out is what they call FDA grass certified, meaning it's recognized as safe in the herb family.
[02:34:27.973 --> 02:34:29.615]  That's a big number one.
[02:34:29.615 --> 02:34:31.998]  We've had multiple top lawyers here.
[02:34:31.998 --> 02:34:33.759]  We've had other industry experts here.
[02:34:33.759 --> 02:34:37.643]  We use three of the biggest and most successful
[02:34:38.803 --> 02:34:41.265]  Manufacturing facilities in the country.
[02:34:41.265 --> 02:34:46.009]  We used two of the biggest and another one that's middle-sized that has some of the best records out there.
[02:34:46.009 --> 02:34:57.519]  We then neurotically double and triple check with outside firms everything we sell, even though we are, quote, relabelers, we don't manufacture it.
[02:34:57.519 --> 02:35:00.962]  Some of the formulas are ours, but technically we are relabelers.
[02:35:00.962 --> 02:35:01.743]  It doesn't matter.
[02:35:01.743 --> 02:35:06.327]  We go to the level of manufacturers ourselves, knowing we're a target.
[02:35:07.895 --> 02:35:09.357]  But in this season, it doesn't matter.
[02:35:09.357 --> 02:35:10.818]  They're coming after everything.
[02:35:10.818 --> 02:35:17.966]  In Europe, under the UN, they're trying to ban medium dosages of vitamin D, vitamin A, and vitamin C. They're not playing games.
[02:35:17.966 --> 02:35:23.012]  And here is the Reuters headline, DOJ to announce actions against dietary supplement makers.
[02:35:23.012 --> 02:35:28.118]  Now, from insiders, they expect this is separate, and it's going to be about
[02:35:29.338 --> 02:35:39.548]  Supposedly some of these dietary supplements that they can tie into the Olympics and claim are part of blood doping and claim to have an amphetamine effect and they want to restrict energy drinks and stuff like that.
[02:35:39.548 --> 02:35:40.969]  They want to get into food in general.
[02:35:42.529 --> 02:35:47.852]  You can't find, legitimately, more than a couple deaths a year from what you could call supplements.
[02:35:47.852 --> 02:35:50.653]  It's one of the safest industries out there.
[02:35:50.653 --> 02:35:53.154]  This has nothing to do with protecting the public.
[02:35:53.154 --> 02:35:55.756]  You have hundreds of thousands of bad interactions a year.
[02:35:55.756 --> 02:35:59.458]  Forty-something thousand deaths a year, they admit, from Big Pharma.
[02:35:59.458 --> 02:36:01.238]  And I'm not saying all of Big Pharma's bad, either.
[02:36:01.238 --> 02:36:03.920]  It's just that, you know, drugs have side effects.
[02:36:03.920 --> 02:36:05.621]  A lot of natural herbs and things don't.
[02:36:05.621 --> 02:36:06.961]  Like, vitamin C doesn't have a side effect.
[02:36:06.961 --> 02:36:11.664]  I guess if you eat too much of it, you might get diarrhea if you eat, like, you know, 10,000 times the recommended dose.
[02:36:12.822 --> 02:36:16.856]  So, this is just all part of the larger assault.
[02:36:16.856 --> 02:36:19.264]  One of the biggest ways we fund ourselves is nutraceuticals.
[02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:32.149]  Whether it's the essential oils that are in the lung cleanse, or whether it's the liver shield that's a cleanse, or whether it's the living defense that flushes out the harmful organisms, parasites, stuff like that.
[02:36:32.149 --> 02:36:37.293]  This is all known stuff for thousands of years to have these effects at very, very low prices.
[02:36:37.293 --> 02:36:38.774]  Take our product, Knockout.
[02:36:38.774 --> 02:36:45.479]  It's nine ingredients, L-tryptophan, melatonin, valerian root, and other things, at the recommended dose.
[02:36:46.701 --> 02:36:51.144]  That synergistically together really helps me sleep deeper, have a more restful sleep.
[02:36:51.144 --> 02:36:53.986]  I mean, good luck making something up about that.
[02:36:53.986 --> 02:36:54.587]  What are you gonna say?
[02:36:54.587 --> 02:36:57.849]  It's $16.95 on sale right now, normally $19.95.
[02:36:57.849 --> 02:37:04.534]  A bottle of the same dose, just of melatonin, costs $19.95.
[02:37:04.534 --> 02:37:13.880]  So, we put eight other things in there, good dosages, healthy dosages, and it's not any more money.
[02:37:13.880 --> 02:37:16.102]  That's what we do at Infowarslife.com.
[02:37:17.816 --> 02:37:30.319]  And it's why so many of the big vitamin type experts love our products and they get such great third party reviews because I have the scientists, the researchers at these big firms coming up with their dream products.
[02:37:30.319 --> 02:37:31.299]  So other people don't do this.
[02:37:31.299 --> 02:37:35.820]  Other people don't put $18 of product in something that costs $40.
[02:37:35.820 --> 02:37:39.981]  Or they don't put $10 of product in something that costs $25.
[02:37:39.981 --> 02:37:40.861]  We still mark it up.
[02:37:40.861 --> 02:37:41.661]  We got to pay the bills.
[02:37:41.661 --> 02:37:44.542]  But most supplements are marked up seven times.
[02:37:45.492 --> 02:37:46.493]  It's all advertising.
[02:37:46.493 --> 02:37:47.554]  It's all packaging.
[02:37:47.554 --> 02:37:48.814]  Not with us, folks.
[02:37:48.814 --> 02:37:50.015]  These are real game-changers.
[02:37:50.015 --> 02:37:56.060]  Whether it's our special, nascent iodine, X-Tube, you name it, Super Mill Vitality.
[02:37:56.060 --> 02:38:01.164]  Now, I wasn't going to announce this until tomorrow, but I got my days messed up, so now we're launching it today.
[02:38:02.216 --> 02:38:09.318]  We now have the Body Cleanze back in stock as well.
[02:38:09.318 --> 02:38:11.418]  So that is back in.
[02:38:11.418 --> 02:38:16.439]  The Total Cleanze, Deep Cleanze, which turns out is the best selling product ever.
[02:38:16.439 --> 02:38:19.080]  X2 is overall the best because we've kept that in stock mainly.
[02:38:19.080 --> 02:38:20.660]  This is sold out twice.
[02:38:20.660 --> 02:38:24.541]  We have the largest shipment ever of it, but the last two times it's sold out in one week.
[02:38:24.541 --> 02:38:28.102]  It's got massive amounts.
[02:38:28.102 --> 02:38:30.083]  There's an informational video on the site.
[02:38:30.083 --> 02:38:31.483]  It's got massive amounts.
[02:38:33.328 --> 02:38:36.429]  Of different compounds known to detoxify the body.
[02:38:36.429 --> 02:38:40.851]  And again, Dr. Gribbs sent an informational video that's on the page so you can watch it and learn about it.
[02:38:40.851 --> 02:38:42.551]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:38:42.551 --> 02:38:47.433]  And it is your purchase of the products that makes this broadcast and what we do possible here.
[02:38:47.433 --> 02:38:50.374]  We also have the Hillary for Prison shirts that are limited edition.
[02:38:50.374 --> 02:38:53.415]  We'll stop selling those December 18th.
[02:38:53.415 --> 02:38:55.395]  So we only sell up until Christmas.
[02:38:55.395 --> 02:38:57.676]  That's the last day we can guarantee shipping inside the U.S.
[02:38:57.676 --> 02:38:58.717]  before Christmas.
[02:38:58.717 --> 02:39:02.218]  So that's available at infowarsstore.com.
[02:39:02.218 --> 02:39:02.478]  Okay.
[02:39:03.726 --> 02:39:07.388]  Shifting gears to Dr. Steve Pachinik of StevePachinik.com.
[02:39:07.388 --> 02:39:14.911]  We're going to find out his view on what's happening geopolitically in the world and what these Friday the 13th attacks mean.
[02:39:14.911 --> 02:39:16.272]  StevePachinik.com.
[02:39:16.272 --> 02:39:25.656]  He's an MD and a PhD and of course been involved in many of the more famous black ops operations and many operations you've never heard about.
[02:39:25.656 --> 02:39:31.158]  So he's uniquely suited to give us his take and his inside view on what's happening.
[02:39:31.158 --> 02:39:32.939]  So Steve Pachinik, thank you for coming on, Doc.
[02:39:33.627 --> 02:39:37.728]  Oh, it's always a pleasure coming on, and it's always a pleasure to hear Stephen Quayle's voice.
[02:39:37.728 --> 02:39:40.529]  I haven't heard it in years.
[02:39:40.529 --> 02:39:46.371]  I worked with him in Montana, so it's quite an interesting family we have here.
[02:39:46.371 --> 02:39:55.394]  Basically, from my point of view, in running a hostage negotiation, about the first time I started the first hostage negotiation in Washington, D.C.
[02:39:55.394 --> 02:40:01.116]  in 78, it was with the Hanafi Muslims, black Muslims, and they also protested.
[02:40:01.736 --> 02:40:04.938]  The point of fact is that I was able to negotiate their release
[02:40:22.620 --> 02:40:25.422]  Some 40 years later, we have the same problem.
[02:40:25.422 --> 02:40:32.048]  The problem isn't just Muslims, because Muslims is a wide-ranging factor.
[02:40:32.048 --> 02:40:37.413]  We have Muslims in Indonesia, we have Muslims in Malaysia, and Shiite Muslims.
[02:40:37.413 --> 02:40:41.036]  What we're talking about here is specifically the Sunnis and ISIS.
[02:40:41.036 --> 02:40:47.962]  And ISIS, from my point of view, came into France for reasons other than their dislike of Christianity.
[02:40:48.542 --> 02:40:50.223]  Or anything to do with the Quran.
[02:40:50.223 --> 02:41:00.966]  From my point of view, one of the issues that I was concerned about, and was true to form, because I predicted there would be Algerians and Pakistani control operatives, and it turned out to be correct.
[02:41:00.966 --> 02:41:07.028]  That the people involved in the attacks were either the sons of Algerians or the Algerians themselves.
[02:41:07.028 --> 02:41:08.288]  Now, why Algerians?
[02:41:08.288 --> 02:41:16.151]  Because for over 30, 40, 50 years, the French have incarcerated over 2 million Algerians
[02:41:16.451 --> 02:41:19.452]  Sure, they got thrown out of Algeria in the battle for Algiers.
[02:41:40.197 --> 02:41:44.382]  Correct, but no one knows to what degree it really occurred.
[02:41:44.382 --> 02:41:51.471]  When I grew up in France, in the southwest of France, in Toulouse, I was privy to explosions all day long.
[02:41:51.471 --> 02:41:58.139]  And the explosions were created either by Algerian operatives or created by the generals who were fighting against the Gaul.
[02:41:58.659 --> 02:42:10.970]  And the famous film The Jackal shows you exactly to what extent people wanted to go to kill Charles de Gaulle because they were disgusted in France with the fact that they had to pull out of Algeria.
[02:42:10.970 --> 02:42:17.135]  A converse of that is that these are the people involved in these attacks against France, Belgium,
[02:42:17.595 --> 02:42:28.930]  Spain and Lebanon are the children of the children who were in the Algerian war, in the Moroccan wars, in the wars involving the colonial empires.
[02:42:28.930 --> 02:42:34.498]  So under the guise of the Koran or Islamism, extremist Islamism, which most of them don't really know.
[02:42:34.958 --> 02:42:37.239]  None of them have really been students of the Quran.
[02:42:37.239 --> 02:42:38.900]  They don't know Islam.
[02:42:38.900 --> 02:42:40.461]  And I'm not pardoning them.
[02:42:40.461 --> 02:42:57.809]  I'm simply saying that they came in to justify the revenge that they were told to inflict by their fathers, their grandfathers, which in fact said, listen, France has been terrible to our people in Algeria, here in France, and elsewhere.
[02:42:57.809 --> 02:43:00.110]  It's not an accident that they came out of Belgium.
[02:43:00.690 --> 02:43:09.516]  Belgium knew very well that there was a NIDUS or a group of operatives who were extreme Islamists in this town called Milkom.
[02:43:09.516 --> 02:43:12.178]  It's a town which is in the suburbs.
[02:43:12.178 --> 02:43:13.879]  I don't know it as well as I know France.
[02:43:15.794 --> 02:43:25.098]  Okay, well, the reason why Belgium is important, and you and I actually talked about it many years ago, is that Belgium, ironically, is not a unified nation.
[02:43:25.098 --> 02:43:33.921]  Although it has the audacity to take over the EU as the center point, Belgium itself is broken up into the Flemish, the Walloons,
[02:43:34.481 --> 02:43:43.088]  French, Flemish and other cultures and they had a very hard time for years getting a prime minister or a leader of that country.
[02:43:43.088 --> 02:43:52.176]  So in fact it's very easy for extremists of any type to go into Belgium and then travel across the border one hour later into France.
[02:43:52.176 --> 02:43:53.877]  I don't think this is a stand down.
[02:43:53.877 --> 02:43:55.418]  I don't think this is a false flag.
[02:43:55.418 --> 02:44:00.903]  But what I do want to encourage our audience to understand is we have to take it easy.
[02:44:01.583 --> 02:44:05.944]  It's not a question that we are on a high alert and we're on the war on terror.
[02:44:05.944 --> 02:44:22.989]  Terror is a strategic and a tactical mechanism which is intended to create fear and no one feeds into that fear better than our American media and the world media where they amp it up to an amazing volume and then you would think you're totally paralyzed.
[02:44:22.989 --> 02:44:26.870]  The truth of the matter is we've had terrorism from the beginning of time and
[02:44:27.370 --> 02:44:30.936]  We were terrorists in the Revolutionary War against the British.
[02:44:30.936 --> 02:44:31.958]  The French were terrorists.
[02:44:31.958 --> 02:44:35.283]  So it's a technique that's being developed.
[02:44:35.283 --> 02:44:39.410]  Is our intelligence and our FBI and our military up to
[02:44:40.077 --> 02:44:40.317]  Sure.
[02:44:40.317 --> 02:44:40.497]  Sure.
[02:44:59.534 --> 02:45:04.176]  Well, that's where I wanted to go next.
[02:45:04.176 --> 02:45:07.238]  It's very confusing, the situation in Syria.
[02:45:07.238 --> 02:45:11.459]  It's been pretty clear up until the last few months who was on whose side.
[02:45:11.459 --> 02:45:15.981]  The West was backing a lot of these ISIS and Al-Qaeda, al-Nusra groups.
[02:45:15.981 --> 02:45:19.082]  Now it appears they might actually be cutting them off and bombing them.
[02:45:19.082 --> 02:45:21.443]  Is that because they didn't serve their purpose successfully?
[02:45:21.443 --> 02:45:23.864]  Or is it because they've become an embarrassment?
[02:45:23.864 --> 02:45:25.445]  Is it because Putin came in?
[02:45:25.445 --> 02:45:27.146]  Or is it still a fake war?
[02:45:27.526 --> 02:45:33.897]  Did ISIS strike back through these North African groups as a threat to France for bombing them?
[02:45:33.897 --> 02:45:38.005]  I mean, as best you can tell them from your sources, how is this really connected to Syria?
[02:45:39.353 --> 02:45:59.521]  This is very much connected to Syria because, number one, everyone has to understand that Bashar Assad and the Assad or the Alawites, these are the minority groups of Shiites, were placed into power from the internal part of Syria right to the Mediterranean and basically on Aleppo and Latakia.
[02:45:59.521 --> 02:46:00.902]  I was there in Syria.
[02:46:00.902 --> 02:46:03.383]  So the French created modern-day Syria.
[02:46:04.003 --> 02:46:06.704]  The second thing is the Shiites, i.e.
[02:46:06.704 --> 02:46:19.811]  the Iranian Revolutionary Guard led by General Soleimani, the Russians, and the most importantly are the Hezbollahs, 8,000 young men from Lebanon who literally go 10 minutes away and fight ISIS.
[02:46:19.811 --> 02:46:29.976]  The truth of the matter is that the only vigil and the only effective counterforce that we have against ISIS is not America, it's not the bombing, it's primarily
[02:46:30.576 --> 02:46:44.339]  The Iranian Revolutionary Guard, Bashar's forces, military forces that are supported by the Russians, and the Hezbollah, young men and women who've been fighting ISIS for well over four to five years in Lebanon.
[02:46:44.339 --> 02:46:47.220]  Because literally ISIS is outside their homes.
[02:46:47.220 --> 02:46:49.300]  So how are things going for ISIS?
[02:46:49.300 --> 02:46:52.581]  And now the French claim they're going to send the French Foreign Legion into there.
[02:46:53.385 --> 02:46:55.107]  Well, I would say the following.
[02:46:55.107 --> 02:47:01.515]  I know the French Foreign Legion because they were trained in a town where my family grew up in Corsica.
[02:47:01.515 --> 02:47:05.180]  The French Foreign Legion is technically not part of the French Army.
[02:47:05.180 --> 02:47:09.626]  They are, in my opinion, one of the most ruthless, effective forces
[02:47:10.487 --> 02:47:11.007]  I think so.
[02:47:25.522 --> 02:47:30.886]  Brings in Germans, Austrians, and all types of criminals who want to have a French passport.
[02:47:30.886 --> 02:47:36.650]  They're exceedingly effective at what they do with sniping and killing at point-blank range.
[02:47:36.650 --> 02:47:40.073]  So the French Foreign Legion is a unit that I would have brought in right away.
[02:47:40.073 --> 02:47:41.434]  It's a legion of assassins.
[02:47:41.434 --> 02:47:43.195]  Is it not a legion of assassins?
[02:47:43.195 --> 02:47:45.336]  Well, that's what war is.
[02:47:45.336 --> 02:47:50.240]  I mean, these are guys who are controlled, disciplined, highly effective assassins.
[02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:51.361]  If I were ISIS,
[02:47:52.157 --> 02:47:55.540]  And really, I'm not that good from the ISIS point of view.
[02:47:55.540 --> 02:47:59.963]  From the point of view of what was said in the media, you'd think these were brilliant combatants.
[02:47:59.963 --> 02:48:01.244]  No, ISIS is not.
[02:48:01.244 --> 02:48:03.405]  They've been trained in certain techniques.
[02:48:03.405 --> 02:48:08.329]  Shooting hostages at point-blank, creating explosives, is not a great military feat.
[02:48:08.889 --> 02:48:12.911]  However, the fast foreign legion can penetrate them very quickly.
[02:48:12.911 --> 02:48:18.854]  They speak Arabic, they know their enemy exceedingly well, and they will come into close quarters.
[02:48:18.854 --> 02:48:23.276]  From the point of view of the United States, we're doing exactly what we should be doing.
[02:48:23.276 --> 02:48:27.778]  Flying out of Turkey, and then insisting that Turkey bring in its ground forces.
[02:48:27.778 --> 02:48:33.140]  Because for the first time, Turkish soldiers are Sunni soldiers, and they know how to fight.
[02:48:33.140 --> 02:48:35.621]  And the Turks were very effective for us in Korea.
[02:48:37.503 --> 02:48:40.967]  So you think the decision's been made now to triple-cross ISIS by the West?
[02:48:54.871 --> 02:49:08.140]  The most important decision in that is really to get into the Royal Family of Saudi Arabia and insist that they step down or stop funding ISIS.
[02:49:08.140 --> 02:49:12.703]  The real money and the support comes from the Caliphate.
[02:49:12.703 --> 02:49:15.185]  So what is the Saudi Royal Family thinking doing this?
[02:49:15.965 --> 02:49:20.247]  Well, they're thinking that the Saudi royal family is a very ineffectual family.
[02:49:20.247 --> 02:49:23.169]  First of all, they're not royal, and they're not Saudi.
[02:49:23.169 --> 02:49:26.811]  They're created by the British after the Ottoman Empire was dissolved.
[02:49:26.811 --> 02:49:30.513]  They're basically Bedouin tribes from Daria.
[02:49:30.513 --> 02:49:31.574]  I've seen that.
[02:49:31.574 --> 02:49:32.514]  They're not effective.
[02:49:32.514 --> 02:49:39.758]  They have a 29-year-old minister, a royal, a prince, so-called prince, who's in charge of the fighting, and he started the fighting in Yemen.
[02:49:39.758 --> 02:49:41.899]  We've supplied them with guns and arms.
[02:49:41.899 --> 02:49:42.840]  That has to stop.
[02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:48.965]  And if that doesn't stop, then I would encourage the young Saudis in their country to overthrow the government.
[02:49:48.965 --> 02:49:50.387]  It's as simple as that.
[02:49:50.387 --> 02:49:51.388]  They're out of control.
[02:49:51.388 --> 02:49:55.411]  They've been a real pain in our neck for about 20 to 30 years.
[02:49:55.411 --> 02:49:58.014]  They funded all of the Sunni extremists.
[02:49:58.014 --> 02:49:59.775]  They were involved in 9-11.
[02:49:59.775 --> 02:50:01.597]  And it's time to take out that family.
[02:50:02.017 --> 02:50:04.719]  From my point of view, they're dispensable.
[02:50:04.719 --> 02:50:07.161]  Same thing UAE, same thing Qatar.
[02:50:07.161 --> 02:50:12.985]  They have no value whatsoever other than draining our own assets and protecting their own assets.
[02:50:12.985 --> 02:50:21.252]  As a matter of fact, Saudi Arabia has come into Arizona, leased our land to extract water for their cattle and bring it back to Saudi Arabia.
[02:50:21.252 --> 02:50:27.156]  So they're a deficit and a major problem for us in the war against the Sunnis and
[02:50:27.236 --> 02:50:33.761]  Well, you're right, and just six months ago they threatened Russia again on Syria, saying they'd stage terror attacks if Russia didn't back off.
[02:50:33.761 --> 02:50:35.562]  So it looks like that bluff didn't work.
[02:50:35.562 --> 02:50:39.785]  So I want to ask Dr. Steve Pachinik in a final segment where he sees all this going.
[02:50:39.785 --> 02:50:41.126]  StevePachinik.com.
[02:50:41.126 --> 02:50:45.369]  You can find his newest book that's actually nonfiction at StevePachinik.com.
[02:50:45.369 --> 02:50:48.031]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, InfoWars.com.
[02:50:48.031 --> 02:50:56.817]  And don't forget, when this hour ends, a whole other hour with David Knight continues at InfoWars.com forward slash show and many stations across the United States.
[02:50:59.144 --> 02:50:59.945]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:50:59.945 --> 02:51:01.746]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:51:01.746 --> 02:51:03.407]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:51:03.407 --> 02:51:06.229]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:51:06.229 --> 02:51:08.511]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:51:08.511 --> 02:51:13.034]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[02:52:59.713 --> 02:53:03.415]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[02:53:03.415 --> 02:53:08.878]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[02:53:08.878 --> 02:53:10.599]  How is this even possible?
[02:53:10.599 --> 02:53:18.664]  Turns out the old guys in this unit had been part of a special test group for a doctor formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[02:53:18.664 --> 02:53:26.369]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[02:53:26.829 --> 02:53:30.530]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units.
[02:53:30.530 --> 02:53:38.291]  But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[02:53:38.291 --> 02:53:39.692]  But you must act fast.
[02:53:39.692 --> 02:53:44.413]  Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard, our supply is extremely limited right now.
[02:53:44.413 --> 02:53:48.554]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens, go to Greens75.com.
[02:53:48.554 --> 02:53:49.254]  That's Greens75.com.
[02:53:49.254 --> 02:53:49.674]  Greens75.com.
[02:54:05.758 --> 02:54:08.082]  Look at your young men fighting.
[02:54:08.082 --> 02:54:12.268]  Look at your women crying.
[02:54:12.268 --> 02:54:15.752]  Look at your young men dying.
[02:54:15.752 --> 02:54:18.476]  The way they've always done before.
[02:54:22.285 --> 02:54:28.826]  And again, he ran many famous anti-terrorism operations, got hostages out many, many times in crises much bigger than this one.
[02:54:28.826 --> 02:54:31.847]  He was involved in Camp David Accords, so many other events.
[02:54:31.847 --> 02:54:35.827]  I mean, we couldn't have a better guest on to talk about specifically what's happening.
[02:54:35.827 --> 02:54:49.170]  I just see the President of France announcing suspending French liberties while they intend on bringing in record numbers of refugees that we know, a lot of which are pilgrims into Syria out of other countries wanting to basically get land.
[02:54:50.509 --> 02:54:54.751]  Basically Sunnis taking over Shiite areas in many cases to oversimplify it.
[02:54:54.751 --> 02:54:56.491]  They've got fake passports.
[02:54:56.491 --> 02:55:02.873]  What is the goal of the West, Dr. Pachinik, to bring in millions of Muslims from radical areas?
[02:55:02.873 --> 02:55:07.595]  What do they expect to happen when there are undoubtedly terror attacks stemming from that?
[02:55:08.431 --> 02:55:10.734]  Well, I'm not sure that we have any goal.
[02:55:10.734 --> 02:55:14.258]  We are not a strategic country, nor is France strategic.
[02:55:14.258 --> 02:55:25.611]  What I've seen with the refugees, and I will hark back to Vladimir Putin, Putin several months ago said something that was very revealing in a conversation, which he said,
[02:55:26.448 --> 02:55:29.990]  I don't understand how the Soviet Union was taken down.
[02:55:29.990 --> 02:55:36.593]  I do not understand how 23 million Russians found that they were alone and wandering about with no country.
[02:55:36.593 --> 02:55:40.695]  Now, as your people know, I was involved to take down the Soviet Union.
[02:55:40.695 --> 02:55:48.980]  What I'm getting to now is that Putin is really paying back the West for what we did 20 years ago in taking down the Soviet Union.
[02:55:48.980 --> 02:55:52.982]  This is Putin's way of allowing the refugees to get out of Syria.
[02:55:53.542 --> 02:55:58.964]  Go in through Greece and flood the Western European markets and the United States.
[02:55:58.964 --> 02:56:00.984]  This is not unintentional.
[02:56:00.984 --> 02:56:02.765]  Syria has very little to do with it.
[02:56:02.765 --> 02:56:05.146]  The Union is totally ineffectual.
[02:56:05.146 --> 02:56:07.006]  And our State Department is ineffectual.
[02:56:07.006 --> 02:56:08.867]  So I would not allow any refugees...
[02:56:09.267 --> 02:56:14.953]  At this point, I don't care who they are, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, because we don't have a vetting system.
[02:56:14.953 --> 02:56:21.299]  But in fact, we have to look back again to a little bit of history and understand why they're being flooded.
[02:56:21.299 --> 02:56:24.362]  They're being flooded because this is Putin's revenge to the West.
[02:56:24.862 --> 02:56:27.424]  For what we had done in the Soviet Union.
[02:56:27.424 --> 02:56:38.153]  And he made it very clear, although we never picked up that message, in the same way that terrorism is an act of fear, to instill fear for the injustices that were done in the past.
[02:56:38.153 --> 02:56:42.957]  You're not excusing it, it's just a very cold calculating technique.
[02:56:42.957 --> 02:56:52.044]  Now many of you know I was involved with the Aldemarra, the Red Brigade, we've taken down the PLO, the PLA, the PSLP, I've been involved in a lot of this.
[02:56:52.564 --> 02:56:56.007]  Now it's time to see who can take down these groups.
[02:56:56.007 --> 02:56:58.730]  Do I have faith in my own government to do it?
[02:56:58.730 --> 02:56:59.631]  Not really.
[02:56:59.631 --> 02:57:05.936]  But I do have faith in the French Foreign Legion to go in there and do what they need to do.
[02:57:05.936 --> 02:57:09.720]  Do I have faith in outsourcing mechanisms that we have at the covert level?
[02:57:10.160 --> 02:57:11.041]  Yes, I do.
[02:57:11.041 --> 02:57:16.325]  We will hire mercenaries and covert operatives to go in and do what they have to do.
[02:57:16.325 --> 02:57:23.871]  But on the military side, as the President said incorrectly, if you have any questions, ask my Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[02:57:23.871 --> 02:57:33.478]  Well, I heard from his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dunford, who is a Marine four-star general, and he said that our primary enemy today is Russia.
[02:57:33.478 --> 02:57:34.399]  Wrong, General.
[02:57:34.799 --> 02:57:41.423]  Our primary enemy is ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and the extremists in the Islamic State, not Russia.
[02:57:41.423 --> 02:57:50.387]  Russia is our new ally, has always been our effective ally when it comes to fighting external threats, and particularly when it comes to terrorism.
[02:57:50.387 --> 02:58:01.914]  Because Putin understands what happens in Central Asia, where you have millions and millions of ruthless extremists in the Caucasus, Azerbaijan, and Turkestan, and other places.
[02:58:02.794 --> 02:58:04.355]  Putin is well experienced.
[02:58:04.355 --> 02:58:08.018]  He's gone in on our behalf to handle Syria.
[02:58:08.018 --> 02:58:10.079]  Our soldiers cannot handle this.
[02:58:10.079 --> 02:58:15.143]  That's a terrible point to point out, but we are not effective.
[02:58:15.143 --> 02:58:22.568]  We have not been effective in combat since 1944, as General Boykin has said, of the Special Forces.
[02:58:22.568 --> 02:58:27.012]  We have not won a battle since the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, and that's the reality.
[02:58:27.552 --> 02:58:29.174]  Dr. Pachinik, we'll talk to you again soon.
[02:58:29.174 --> 02:58:30.094]  StevePachinik.com.

[02:58:40.684 --> 02:58:41.845]  They want to shut this down.
[02:58:41.845 --> 02:58:42.566]  Never forget that.

[03:00:01.144 --> 03:00:07.787]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:07.787 --> 03:00:10.749]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:14.246 --> 03:00:18.910]  Welcome to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Radio Show on this Tuesday, November 17, 2015.
[03:00:18.910 --> 03:00:20.671]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[03:00:20.671 --> 03:00:25.896]  Chakari Jackson will be joining me in the next segment, breaking down some of the breaking news.
[03:00:25.896 --> 03:00:35.063]  And of course, yesterday, and I didn't realize this until I saw this article in the New American, yesterday was the 217th anniversary of something very important.
[03:00:35.063 --> 03:00:36.404]  What would that be, we might ask?
[03:00:36.404 --> 03:00:38.146]  I'll give you a moment to think about it.
[03:00:38.866 --> 03:00:39.687]  Time's up.
[03:00:39.687 --> 03:00:44.470]  It's the 217th anniversary of signing of the Kentucky Resolutions.
[03:00:44.470 --> 03:00:46.472]  Now, that may sound like something that's very obscure.
[03:00:46.472 --> 03:00:49.314]  A lot of our audience will know exactly what that is.
[03:00:49.314 --> 03:00:51.316]  Many of you listening may not know what that is.
[03:00:51.316 --> 03:00:59.602]  We're going to break that down for you because yesterday, we had something that really bears upon the issue of the Kentucky Resolutions.
[03:00:59.602 --> 03:01:04.026]  And that is, where does power reside in our Republic, rightfully?
[03:01:04.861 --> 03:01:08.562]  How is it divided between the states and the central government, and where does it rightfully divide?
[03:01:08.562 --> 03:01:12.883]  Because yesterday, we had a mass of governors.
[03:01:12.883 --> 03:01:16.183]  It began with six, by the end of the day it was 21.
[03:01:16.183 --> 03:01:20.044]  Today, it was more than half of the governors have now said, you know what?
[03:01:20.044 --> 03:01:26.965]  We're not going to sign on to Obama's suicide pack of importing ISIS into the United States.
[03:01:26.965 --> 03:01:28.426]  We're just not going to do it.
[03:01:28.426 --> 03:01:30.066]  It's absolute idiocy.
[03:01:30.899 --> 03:01:35.544]  As Donald Trump said, it's a Trojan horse, absolutely a Trojan horse.
[03:01:35.544 --> 03:01:51.559]  We can look at the figures that we saw, and we talked about this last night on the Nightly News, ISIS is bragging that out of the 5 million migrants that have come into Europe, that 4,000 of them are ISIS members, ISIS jihadi terrorists.
[03:01:51.559 --> 03:01:52.840]  Does that sound too high?
[03:01:52.840 --> 03:01:54.481]  I mean, we're talking about 5 million people here.
[03:01:55.422 --> 03:01:59.486]  And they're saying 4,000 of them would be... That's not that high, actually.
[03:01:59.486 --> 03:02:02.950]  That is .08%.
[03:02:02.950 --> 03:02:06.133]  Less than one-tenth of 1% of the people coming in.
[03:02:06.133 --> 03:02:08.175]  In other words, think about it this way.
[03:02:08.175 --> 03:02:13.140]  If 99.92% of the people coming in were simply economic refugees.
[03:02:13.140 --> 03:02:16.003]  They simply wanted to move to Europe because they wanted to make more money.
[03:02:16.003 --> 03:02:16.984]  Totally peaceful people.
[03:02:18.359 --> 03:02:25.063]  That remaining 0.08% would work out to 4,000 terrorists.
[03:02:25.063 --> 03:02:28.345]  And we saw what a half dozen of them did to Paris.
[03:02:28.345 --> 03:02:30.366]  But Obama says, no, no, no.
[03:02:30.366 --> 03:02:32.367]  We are better than that.
[03:02:32.367 --> 03:02:34.849]  We have to do this in the name of compassion.
[03:02:34.849 --> 03:02:37.791]  So we're going to talk about what Obama is promising to do.
[03:02:37.791 --> 03:02:43.174]  He's talking about, you know, we see this figure of 10,000 being pushed around by the mainstream media.
[03:02:43.174 --> 03:02:44.395]  John Kerry made that very clear.
[03:02:44.395 --> 03:02:46.796]  10,000 is not the ceiling.
[03:02:46.796 --> 03:02:47.537]  It's the floor.
[03:02:48.197 --> 03:02:49.299]  It's the floor.
[03:02:49.299 --> 03:02:54.486]  They're looking to pull in $100,000 this year and $100,000 next year.
[03:02:54.486 --> 03:02:55.247]  That's their goal.
[03:02:55.247 --> 03:02:57.390]  They don't have a ceiling, you understand.
[03:02:57.390 --> 03:02:58.111]  They have a floor.
[03:02:59.116 --> 03:03:02.638]  In terms of the number of ISIS that they're going to bring in.
[03:03:02.638 --> 03:03:05.899]  And, of course, that's precisely what's going on.
[03:03:05.899 --> 03:03:20.485]  We all know, anyone who listens to this show, anyone who is awake, understands, and we had this discussion a couple years ago, back in 2013, when they were trying to build pressure for a movement, a mass movement, into Syria, creating a no-fly zone at that time.
[03:03:20.485 --> 03:03:25.788]  People said, no, we're not going to be al-Qaeda's air force, because they understood what was going on there, so they renamed it
[03:03:26.368 --> 03:03:36.118]  Moved it along and of course the basis of that was a false report about sarin gas saying, well that could only have come from the Assad government.
[03:03:36.118 --> 03:03:37.019]  That wasn't true.
[03:03:37.019 --> 03:03:39.762]  There was experience about that in the past and we made that very clear.
[03:03:39.762 --> 03:03:43.426]  We're also going to talk briefly a little bit about the Democrat debate.
[03:03:43.426 --> 03:03:48.852]  I mentioned this on the nightly news last night and there was one exchange in particular, there were several of them that were very interesting.
[03:03:49.958 --> 03:03:57.443]  One of them in particular was Bernie Sandinista was pointedly asked, how are you going to pay for all this?
[03:03:57.443 --> 03:03:59.485]  What kind of income tax rate are you looking at?
[03:03:59.485 --> 03:04:00.806]  And he goes, well, I wouldn't make it 90%.
[03:04:00.806 --> 03:04:05.469]  I'm not as much of a socialist as Eisenhower.
[03:04:05.629 --> 03:04:06.790]  Well, we're going to talk about that.
[03:04:06.790 --> 03:04:08.431]  What were the rates under Eisenhower?
[03:04:08.431 --> 03:04:09.932]  What were the rates under Nixon?
[03:04:09.932 --> 03:04:12.214]  Because then Governor O'Malley brought in Richard Nixon.
[03:04:12.214 --> 03:04:15.036]  So, well, Richard Nixon had 70% interest rates.
[03:04:15.036 --> 03:04:16.197]  No, that's where he started.
[03:04:16.197 --> 03:04:22.482]  We're going to talk about the truth of all this, and we're going to talk about the real socialist that's there, FDR.
[03:04:22.482 --> 03:04:24.523]  What did he do to the income tax rates?
[03:04:24.523 --> 03:04:27.646]  But more importantly, what did he do to the working poor?
[03:04:27.646 --> 03:04:29.667]  What did he do to the median family income?
[03:04:29.667 --> 03:04:31.949]  And we're also going to talk about Janet Yellen.
[03:04:31.949 --> 03:04:34.411]  She's pushing back very hard against the FORM Act.
[03:04:34.631 --> 03:04:43.150]  That is being sponsored by Rand Paul and others in the Congress to try to get some accountability and some control over the Federal Reserve and Janet Yellen won't have any of it.
[03:04:43.150 --> 03:04:44.874]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back with Jakari Jackson.
[03:04:58.317 --> 03:05:09.229]  Black Lives Matter activists and other radical leftists are using the hashtag F-Paris to voice their anger over the fact that the ISIS attacks have shifted the public's attention away from the University of Missouri protests.
[03:05:09.229 --> 03:05:19.681]  The disgusting hashtag started trending on Twitter Sunday as Soros-backed activists grew outraged over the fact that the public is more concerned about the 129 people killed in Paris than they are about safe spaces.
[03:05:19.961 --> 03:05:39.796]  One self-described internationally known activist tweeted, quote, Basically speaking, the F-Paris crowd is claiming that more people are paying attention to the Paris terrorist attacks than the Mizzou protests because the Paris massacre is a so-called white tragedy.
[03:05:39.796 --> 03:05:44.260]  As if we should judge tragedies by the victim's skin color, a notion that's inherently racist.
[03:05:44.560 --> 03:05:53.592]  But it is interesting to note, however, that the same global elites who have radicalized the Black Lives Matter movement are also the same ones who created conditions for ISIS to attack Paris.

[03:06:51.581 --> 03:06:52.041]  Secret 12.
[03:06:52.041 --> 03:06:54.062]  InfoWars Life's Vitamin B12 Formulation.
[03:07:02.205 --> 03:07:08.508]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[03:07:08.508 --> 03:07:15.791]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.

[03:08:00.278 --> 03:08:03.060]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:03.060 --> 03:08:05.841]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:09.560 --> 03:08:10.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:10.960 --> 03:08:11.560]  I'm David Knight.
[03:08:11.560 --> 03:08:16.681]  For the fourth hour, we have Jakari Jackson joining us to break down some of the breaking news.
[03:08:16.681 --> 03:08:22.322]  And later in the broadcast, I'm going to talk about the emerging conflict between U.S.
[03:08:22.322 --> 03:08:33.244]  governors and Barack Obama, who insists that he's going to bring in Syrian quote-unquote refugees, regardless of what the American governors say they're going to do.
[03:08:33.244 --> 03:08:38.345]  And we're going to look at the 217th anniversary of the Kentucky Resolutions, a
[03:08:39.065 --> 03:08:39.345]  Thank you.
[03:08:58.107 --> 03:09:03.250]  Is essentially a plan to take down our civilization, take down our nations.
[03:09:03.250 --> 03:09:05.691]  They say they don't want to have any national borders anymore.
[03:09:05.691 --> 03:09:06.231]  Of course they don't.
[03:09:06.231 --> 03:09:10.613]  They want to level everything so they can impose the New World Order.
[03:09:10.613 --> 03:09:12.774]  And they're coming at that from two different directions.
[03:09:12.774 --> 03:09:19.557]  They have one way to sell the New World Government to conservatives and say this is about free trade and economics.
[03:09:19.557 --> 03:09:22.039]  That would be the Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[03:09:22.039 --> 03:09:24.480]  For the liberals, again in Paris in just two weeks,
[03:09:24.980 --> 03:09:32.525]  They're coming up with a climate change summit, and so they're going to sell world governance based on saving the environment.
[03:09:32.525 --> 03:09:37.869]  And they'll probably get both of these through, but either one of them, Jakari, would be world government, and it would be a disaster for us.
[03:09:37.869 --> 03:09:41.972]  Yeah, you're talking about how Obama wants to bring so many people into the nation.
[03:09:41.972 --> 03:09:44.773]  You know, 10,000, I believe, was a lowball estimate.
[03:09:44.773 --> 03:09:52.439]  His top advisor saying, Mr. President, we cannot background check that large amount of people in the two months left we have in the year.
[03:09:52.439 --> 03:09:54.180]  They don't care about background checks.
[03:09:54.700 --> 03:09:55.421]  I don't think so.
[03:10:11.474 --> 03:10:11.954]  We're good to go.
[03:10:33.268 --> 03:10:38.095]  And it's a double tap on the hands of the government because they use your tax dollars to go tear up these countries.
[03:10:38.095 --> 03:10:38.315]  Yes.
[03:10:38.315 --> 03:10:41.059]  And then they bring them here and they say, well, you guys need to flip the bill.
[03:10:41.059 --> 03:10:42.321]  You need to do your part.
[03:10:42.321 --> 03:10:46.847]  Well, Obama, Washington, why don't you do your part and stop destroying these countries?
[03:10:46.847 --> 03:10:48.790]  Well, they have to destroy the first world nations.
[03:10:49.170 --> 03:10:53.731]  Because the First World Nations are the only ones who are going to stand up to their world governance.
[03:10:53.731 --> 03:10:59.973]  There are people who have the money and the financial ability and the time to take a look at politics and that is diminishing.
[03:10:59.973 --> 03:11:09.676]  You know, as you get to the point where you're struggling to make ends meet financially, you have less and less time to pay attention or to do anything when these guys are stealing everything from you.
[03:11:09.676 --> 03:11:10.656]  So they have to take down
[03:11:11.016 --> 03:11:12.537]  Absolutely, they don't want any accountability.
[03:11:12.537 --> 03:11:15.958]  But on the same notion of accountability, we'll talk about some domestic unaccountability.
[03:11:15.958 --> 03:11:18.559]  We have this article, police civil asset forfeitures exceed all burglaries in 2014.
[03:11:39.168 --> 03:11:43.309]  Which basically means the cops are taking more than the crooks.
[03:11:43.309 --> 03:11:46.471]  Well, you're several times more likely to be shot by the police than by terrorists, too.
[03:11:46.471 --> 03:11:46.771]  Oh, yeah.
[03:11:46.771 --> 03:11:49.352]  I don't know what the exact figure is, but it was something like that.
[03:11:49.352 --> 03:11:56.074]  The article came out, I believe it was this year, that the police have killed more people now than they killed in Iraq or something along those lines.
[03:11:56.474 --> 03:11:59.937]  So we're much more concerned about the shoot first rules that the police have.
[03:11:59.937 --> 03:12:00.817]  I've got an article right here.
[03:12:00.817 --> 03:12:05.881]  Five people shot by local police in North Miami-Dade in 48 hours over the weekend.
[03:12:05.881 --> 03:12:10.764]  So this is the way that the police are now, their standard operating procedure about how they interact with the public.
[03:12:10.764 --> 03:12:15.208]  So we're really at far greater danger from our own police than we are from terrorists.
[03:12:15.208 --> 03:12:18.010]  Absolutely, because we have a very large police force there.
[03:12:19.443 --> 03:12:20.584]  Moderately trained.
[03:12:20.584 --> 03:12:22.365]  Being polite about it.
[03:12:22.365 --> 03:12:28.469]  You know, we think about situations like, not just the famous cases we have, but some of the more low-key cases.
[03:12:28.469 --> 03:12:30.991]  The Empire State Building is one of my favorite examples.
[03:12:30.991 --> 03:12:33.913]  The officers, they respond to an active situation.
[03:12:33.913 --> 03:12:36.955]  They opened fire and hit nine other people who are not their intended targets.
[03:12:36.955 --> 03:12:38.136]  You know, who gets blamed for that?
[03:12:38.136 --> 03:12:39.717]  You know, it's an oops.
[03:12:39.717 --> 03:12:41.518]  You know, something that simple.
[03:12:41.858 --> 03:12:47.960]  So yeah, if you look at the American police forces, they would be the fourth largest army in the world if they were a standing army.
[03:12:47.960 --> 03:12:54.181]  And they're doing everything they can to turn them into an army, but you're pointing out now they're also the ones who are stealing the most merchandise.
[03:12:54.181 --> 03:12:56.262]  Oh yeah, and they have the article breakdown.
[03:12:56.262 --> 03:13:00.083]  This is from Armstrong Economics, and it says between 1989 and 2010, U.S.
[03:13:00.083 --> 03:13:00.943]  attorneys seized an estimated
[03:13:04.304 --> 03:13:04.644]  I think so.
[03:13:26.653 --> 03:13:27.394]  Let's talk about that.
[03:13:27.394 --> 03:13:28.556]  It truly is robbery.
[03:13:28.556 --> 03:13:32.440]  They call it civil asset forfeiture and everything about that is a lie.
[03:13:32.440 --> 03:13:34.783]  They're saying you're going to forfeit your assets.
[03:13:34.783 --> 03:13:41.572]  They take this property from people alleging that the property could have been involved in some way with a crime independent of the owner.
[03:13:42.072 --> 03:13:47.256]  Okay, and they don't ever charge you with a crime, they never find you guilty of a crime, they just seize your property.
[03:13:47.256 --> 03:13:51.319]  And because they call it civil, that means that you have no due process.
[03:13:51.319 --> 03:14:10.354]  If it was criminal seizure, if they'd actually charged you with a crime, and they took your property, no, no, no, they would then have to go through and invent some new law or something to overturn the Constitution and say, no, we're not going to give you due process, we're not going to wait until we find you guilty, but they call it civil instead of criminal, so then they can just, according to them, steal anything that they want from you.
[03:14:10.794 --> 03:14:12.316]  That's the way these crooks operate.
[03:14:12.316 --> 03:14:15.421]  That's the crookedness of the federal government.
[03:14:15.421 --> 03:14:19.427]  How these people have really turned into a crime, organized crime.
[03:14:19.427 --> 03:14:21.530]  It's nothing, it's just organized crime.
[03:14:21.530 --> 03:14:24.535]  And these guys are shooting people on the streets like the mafia.
[03:14:24.535 --> 03:14:26.137]  Yeah, and on those same lines.
[03:14:26.998 --> 03:14:29.740]  We have a Hollywood star, this is Dan Bazirian.
[03:14:29.740 --> 03:14:33.082]  He's a professional gambler, all this stuff.
[03:14:33.082 --> 03:14:36.824]  He was on Drudge and basically he had a situation at his home.
[03:14:36.824 --> 03:14:40.627]  He wasn't home at the time, but somebody broke into his house, tried to break into his gun vault.
[03:14:40.627 --> 03:14:45.530]  Unsuccessful in their efforts, the police show up, break open the gun vault and steal his guns.
[03:14:45.530 --> 03:14:47.912]  Yeah, the police stole it.
[03:14:47.912 --> 03:14:49.733]  How is this evidence?
[03:14:49.733 --> 03:14:52.434]  Nobody actually physically touched the guns except the police.
[03:14:52.434 --> 03:14:56.057]  They eventually returned the firearms, but they kept the magazines and the ammunition.
[03:14:56.457 --> 03:14:57.538]  Yeah.
[03:14:57.538 --> 03:14:58.579]  Not all of it.
[03:14:58.579 --> 03:15:02.182]  And that's what he does as part of his, he's like an internet star, isn't he?
[03:15:02.182 --> 03:15:03.603]  He shoots guns and stuff.
[03:15:03.603 --> 03:15:06.926]  He's a model, he shoots guns and things like that.
[03:15:06.926 --> 03:15:08.767]  So that's part of his livelihood.
[03:15:08.767 --> 03:15:17.154]  And now they've taken it, they have, as far as I know, no immediate plans to return it, but why they took it in the first place is so far beyond me.
[03:15:17.154 --> 03:15:22.318]  What logic they used to see something for evidence that was never actually touched in a crime.
[03:15:22.618 --> 03:15:22.858]  I don't
[03:15:40.772 --> 03:15:42.454]  Under any kind of checks or balances.
[03:15:42.454 --> 03:15:43.776]  They don't really have to obey the law.
[03:15:43.776 --> 03:15:44.897]  They can do whatever they want to.
[03:15:44.897 --> 03:15:46.279]  They can steal your property.
[03:15:46.279 --> 03:15:47.240]  They can shoot you.
[03:15:47.240 --> 03:15:50.003]  I've got an article here about a North Carolina dad who was fatally shot.
[03:15:50.003 --> 03:15:53.207]  They went to his house looking for somebody that no longer lived there.
[03:15:53.207 --> 03:15:53.988]  He said get a warrant.
[03:15:53.988 --> 03:15:54.449]  Shut the door.
[03:15:54.449 --> 03:15:55.410]  They break in.
[03:15:55.410 --> 03:15:56.831]  Taser wind up killing the guy.
[03:15:57.632 --> 03:15:58.773]  For no reason at all.
[03:15:58.773 --> 03:15:59.353]  For no reason at all.
[03:15:59.353 --> 03:16:03.837]  They instigate something, and then they say, I feared for my life, so I shot him.
[03:16:03.837 --> 03:16:04.977]  I used excessive force.
[03:16:04.977 --> 03:16:06.078]  Because you know what?
[03:16:06.078 --> 03:16:21.249]  If you or I were to initiate a conflict with somebody, if you or I were to shoot somebody when we're not really in any danger, shoot people who are running away, shoot people who are a far distance from us that are unarmed, we would be rightfully tried for murder.
[03:16:21.249 --> 03:16:23.110]  And these cops are never tried for murder.
[03:16:23.530 --> 03:16:26.992]  No, because it's the, what do you call it, the thin blue line.
[03:16:26.992 --> 03:16:33.935]  If it's an officer or somebody wearing a badge or a suit, then they assume that it's on the up and up, but that's not always the case.
[03:16:33.935 --> 03:16:37.156]  The government has made it clear to them that they're going to stand behind them.
[03:16:37.156 --> 03:16:40.558]  They want them, they want them to be aggressive with the public.
[03:16:40.558 --> 03:16:41.318]  That's the whole point.
[03:16:41.798 --> 03:16:50.583]  And I think relations with police would be a whole lot better, you know, if we had more officers come out and decry the actions that we're seeing around the country, you know, various actions.
[03:16:50.583 --> 03:16:54.646]  And, you know, of course, I don't blame all actions for everything a police officer does.
[03:16:54.646 --> 03:16:59.749]  But, you know, I've seen the memes like, I'll believe that there are good police when good police start arresting bad police.
[03:17:00.089 --> 03:17:06.712]  When they put these guys in jail, when they don't just do a slap on the wrist, or if you retire early, we won't pursue any charges against you.
[03:17:06.712 --> 03:17:14.295]  When they actually come down on these guys hard and hold them accountable for the action that they're doing, then I think things will take a very positive turn in this country.
[03:17:14.295 --> 03:17:14.715]  Exactly.
[03:17:14.715 --> 03:17:16.336]  It's what Frank Serpico said.
[03:17:16.336 --> 03:17:19.217]  He said, you're going to always have bad people in any system.
[03:17:19.217 --> 03:17:20.278]  And there are bad cops.
[03:17:20.278 --> 03:17:21.438]  And there are good cops.
[03:17:21.438 --> 03:17:22.099]  The question is,
[03:17:22.819 --> 03:17:24.040]  What does the system do?
[03:17:24.040 --> 03:17:29.183]  Does the system purge the bad people out, or does it embrace them and embrace the corruption?
[03:17:29.183 --> 03:17:31.224]  If it does, things go downhill very quickly.
[03:17:31.224 --> 03:17:32.004]  That's what we're seeing now.
[03:17:32.004 --> 03:17:35.406]  The system will not come against the bad cops in most cases.
[03:17:35.406 --> 03:17:38.688]  They will embrace them, and that's precisely the opposite of what we need to be doing.
[03:17:38.688 --> 03:17:39.749]  What else have we got there, Jagari?
[03:17:39.949 --> 03:17:41.831]  I'm going to talk about a little bit of TSA.
[03:17:41.831 --> 03:17:43.992]  I know you've had your adventures with the TSA.
[03:17:43.992 --> 03:17:47.335]  I think we've all had some adventures with the TSA.
[03:17:47.335 --> 03:17:51.938]  And now the TSA is failing to detect loaded guns through their airport scanners.
[03:17:51.938 --> 03:17:59.024]  You know, the last time I went through the TSA, you know, we travel, David, we take camera equipment, microphones, cables, all these things.
[03:17:59.364 --> 03:18:01.285]  They routinely take stuff out of my bag.
[03:18:01.285 --> 03:18:02.806]  I was with Michael on our last trip.
[03:18:02.806 --> 03:18:04.187]  You know, they, you know, pat him down.
[03:18:04.187 --> 03:18:05.227]  They're digging through my bag.
[03:18:05.227 --> 03:18:09.049]  Of course, there's nothing in there except some toothpastes they said was too large.
[03:18:09.049 --> 03:18:12.771]  They took my toothpaste, Tom's fluoride-free toothpaste.
[03:18:12.771 --> 03:18:18.835]  And, but now we see that the TSA can't even stop a gun from going through the scanners.
[03:18:19.275 --> 03:18:24.565]  Was this the case where the guy was traveling on the plane and when he reached his destination, he realized, oh, I've got this gun on me.
[03:18:24.565 --> 03:18:25.627]  Yeah, that's pretty much what it was.
[03:18:25.627 --> 03:18:26.809]  He was a trucker.
[03:18:26.809 --> 03:18:28.593]  You know, he didn't do it as a stunt or anything like that.
[03:18:28.593 --> 03:18:31.197]  He just legitimately forgot he had it in his bag.
[03:18:32.446 --> 03:18:36.187]  He wound up getting off the plane, you know, had his firearm with him the whole time.
[03:18:36.187 --> 03:18:37.628]  But see, that's not surprising.
[03:18:37.628 --> 03:18:43.290]  Because they had inspectors that would set up false scenarios where they would deliberately try to smuggle this through.
[03:18:43.290 --> 03:18:45.611]  And we reported on this about two months ago.
[03:18:45.611 --> 03:18:59.556]  And they had a 0% detection of all these different cases where they took a government agent, put a firearm on him, ran him through the TSA security, and every one of the cases they were able to get through.
[03:19:00.456 --> 03:19:01.916]  And Jakari, they know that.
[03:19:01.916 --> 03:19:08.358]  They know going back to 2011, we had the engineer Corbett, who showed that he could smuggle a weapon through.
[03:19:08.358 --> 03:19:12.559]  There was a blind spot in the naked body scanners, and he wrote articles about that.
[03:19:12.559 --> 03:19:21.420]  And then he subsequently sued the TSA for violation of his Fourth Amendment rights, because they are violating everybody's Fourth Amendment rights as part of discovery of that lawsuit.
[03:19:21.420 --> 03:19:23.541]  And we reported on that here at InfoWars.
[03:19:24.501 --> 03:19:46.029]  He had asked for some documents and they posted, when they put it up on Pacer.gov, which is where they list the lawsuits, they put up the unredacted copy first and you could see that the TSA said that in 2011 there were no threats to airports or airplanes and yet that same year they were going to shut down Texas as a no-fly zone because it was a bill to stop the sexual molestation, the violation of Fourth Amendment.
[03:19:46.029 --> 03:19:46.609]  Yes, I remember that.
[03:19:46.809 --> 03:19:48.010]  Thank you so much, Jakari Jackson.
[03:19:48.010 --> 03:19:49.092]  Stay with us when we come back.
[03:19:49.092 --> 03:19:58.663]  We're going to talk about what's going on with Obama's importation of ISIS terrorists and the pushback that may come to a head between state governors and Obama.
[03:19:58.663 --> 03:19:59.243]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:01.260 --> 03:20:05.901]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[03:20:05.901 --> 03:20:10.182]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[03:20:10.182 --> 03:20:11.562]  We typically do the same thing.
[03:20:11.562 --> 03:20:14.602]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[03:20:14.602 --> 03:20:16.803]  But have you considered heat storage?
[03:20:16.803 --> 03:20:19.003]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[03:20:19.003 --> 03:20:21.303]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[03:20:21.303 --> 03:20:22.944]  How will I keep my family warm?
[03:20:22.944 --> 03:20:25.424]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[03:20:25.424 --> 03:20:29.485]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[03:20:30.305 --> 03:20:31.426]  Another concern?
[03:20:31.426 --> 03:20:35.408]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[03:20:35.408 --> 03:20:37.990]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[03:20:37.990 --> 03:20:41.973]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[03:20:41.973 --> 03:20:44.775]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[03:20:44.775 --> 03:20:49.438]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.

[03:24:11.232 --> 03:24:12.433]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:12.433 --> 03:24:13.974]  I'm David Knight, your host in this hour.
[03:24:13.974 --> 03:24:19.079]  I want to talk about what's going on with efforts to try to rein in the Federal Reserve.
[03:24:19.079 --> 03:24:28.286]  I also want to mention one or two episodes from the Democrat debate that I find very instructive because, you know, we understand we're not naive.
[03:24:28.286 --> 03:24:30.008]  We understand what the elections are.
[03:24:30.008 --> 03:24:34.592]  And we understand that elections, as bad as they are, the presidential elections, are the worst case scenario.
[03:24:35.399 --> 03:24:46.502]  It's there that they try to detract you from any local efforts, any local involvement that could really make a difference in a real grassroots movement.
[03:24:46.502 --> 03:24:53.003]  They want you to get focused on the most centralized, most bought-out race there is in the country.
[03:24:53.003 --> 03:24:56.344]  That's the presidential race, thinking that you're going to make a difference.
[03:24:56.344 --> 03:24:59.825]  But it's still important to look at the way these people manipulate.
[03:25:00.717 --> 03:25:06.319]  And understand that this is going to be, we're looking at the manipulator, the propagandist-in-chief.
[03:25:06.319 --> 03:25:06.519]  Okay?
[03:25:06.519 --> 03:25:08.359]  And we're going to be selecting the President.
[03:25:08.359 --> 03:25:12.901]  And there's no better evidence of that than what happened in the Democrat debate.
[03:25:12.901 --> 03:25:16.822]  And as I point out, we're also going to be taking a look at the efforts to try to control the Federal Reserve.
[03:25:17.674 --> 03:25:21.095]  Before we do, I just want to let you know about the specials that we have at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:25:21.095 --> 03:25:25.897]  We have a new special, Knockout, at 15% off at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:25:25.897 --> 03:25:28.278]  Knockout Sleep Support Formula.
[03:25:28.278 --> 03:25:30.118]  Available while supplies last.
[03:25:30.118 --> 03:25:32.619]  I've had trouble falling asleep myself at night for years.
[03:25:32.619 --> 03:25:35.020]  I can tell the difference when I forget to take Knockout.
[03:25:35.700 --> 03:25:39.584]  For the same price as some supplements that only contain melatonin.
[03:25:39.584 --> 03:25:41.185]  I've used melatonin myself.
[03:25:41.185 --> 03:25:43.047]  We've got reporters now there in France.
[03:25:43.047 --> 03:25:44.529]  It's very helpful.
[03:25:44.529 --> 03:25:53.177]  That's been helpful just by itself for me to try to reset my biological clock when I'm traveling to reset the times that I go to sleep and that sort of thing.
[03:25:53.177 --> 03:25:54.759]  But Knockout doesn't just have melatonin.
[03:25:55.299 --> 03:26:07.768]  It also has other natural ingredients like valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, hops flower extract, L-tryptophan, that's something you'll get to experience coming up in Thanksgiving as you have turkey, and other key ingredients.
[03:26:07.768 --> 03:26:09.529]  Right now you can feel the punch.
[03:26:09.529 --> 03:26:12.652]  Get Knockout today at InfoWarsLife.com for 15% off.
[03:26:12.652 --> 03:26:16.835]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and also we still have in stock our
[03:26:17.435 --> 03:26:19.297]  New product, Living Defense.
[03:26:19.297 --> 03:26:22.120]  Nine out of ten people are infested with harmful organisms.
[03:26:22.120 --> 03:26:27.646]  Living Defense uses wild-crafted organic herbs to help naturally cleanse these organisms from your body.
[03:26:27.646 --> 03:26:30.529]  We're expected to run out of that soon, so look for that right now.
[03:26:30.529 --> 03:26:33.852]  That's livingdefense at infowarslife.com.
[03:26:33.852 --> 03:26:34.673]  Now, there were several things.
[03:26:34.673 --> 03:26:37.316]  I talked about these last night on the nightly news.
[03:26:37.316 --> 03:26:38.998]  Several things that came up with the Democrat debate.
[03:26:40.180 --> 03:26:44.442]  They tried very hard to get them to say radical Islam.
[03:26:44.442 --> 03:26:47.204]  Radical, say it with me, radical Islam.
[03:26:47.204 --> 03:26:49.525]  They absolutely, absolutely refused.
[03:26:49.525 --> 03:26:58.570]  Hillary tried to spin it and say, well, I don't think, you know, we're not against all Islamists, all Muslims.
[03:26:58.570 --> 03:27:00.271]  Actually, she said Muslims, I think, okay?
[03:27:01.352 --> 03:27:02.733]  We're not against all Muslims.
[03:27:02.733 --> 03:27:07.657]  And he said, well, he was quoting Marco Rubio, and he said, well, he wasn't talking about all Muslims.
[03:27:07.657 --> 03:27:09.538]  He was talking about radical Islamists.
[03:27:09.538 --> 03:27:10.419]  Are you afraid to say that?
[03:27:10.419 --> 03:27:12.881]  Yes, I don't think that would be very helpful.
[03:27:12.881 --> 03:27:21.027]  All three of them were unable to use, to utter those syllables and understand one of the reasons why that is, okay?
[03:27:21.027 --> 03:27:22.929]  We see this with the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[03:27:22.929 --> 03:27:24.150]  Go, just as an exercise.
[03:27:24.775 --> 03:27:28.440]  Go to the Southern Poverty Law Center and do a search on their website.
[03:27:28.440 --> 03:27:32.625]  Whenever you see radical Islam, you will not see them talking about real radical Islam.
[03:27:32.625 --> 03:27:36.930]  You'll see them talking about people who talk about radical Islam.
[03:27:36.930 --> 03:27:38.632]  See, radical Islam is not the problem.
[03:27:38.632 --> 03:27:41.216]  People who talk about radical Islam are the problem.
[03:27:41.988 --> 03:27:47.913]  They're portrayed as racists, they're portrayed as xenophobes, they're portrayed as anti-immigrant.
[03:27:47.913 --> 03:27:59.203]  And the same thing is true of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, ISD, the think tank in Europe that is behind the New Strong Cities Network.
[03:27:59.203 --> 03:28:07.410]  Both ISD in Europe and SPLC in the United States, who set up the talking points that we're being propagandized with, that anyone who is concerned at all
[03:28:08.050 --> 03:28:13.357]  About the, as ISIS put it, the 4,000 plus terrorists that have come in through the open borders.
[03:28:13.357 --> 03:28:15.180]  And I talked about how that's very plausible.
[03:28:15.180 --> 03:28:16.642]  That's only 0.08%.
[03:28:16.642 --> 03:28:21.989]  It's eight-tenths of one percent of the people that they've let in.
[03:28:21.989 --> 03:28:23.531]  It's only eight-tenths of one percent.
[03:28:24.292 --> 03:28:27.914]  are jihadi terrorists, then you get 4,000 people.
[03:28:27.914 --> 03:28:29.595]  So, they couldn't talk about that.
[03:28:29.595 --> 03:28:33.337]  Hillary told some amazing, amazing whoppers.
[03:28:33.337 --> 03:28:37.419]  I mean, these are things kind of like the story of Pecos Bill.
[03:28:37.419 --> 03:28:39.860]  You know, where he got thirsty, so he dug the Rio Grande.
[03:28:39.860 --> 03:28:41.441]  You know, he shot out all the stars but one.
[03:28:41.441 --> 03:28:43.823]  That's how we got the Lone Star State.
[03:28:43.823 --> 03:28:48.385]  This is the kind of stuff that Hillary was spinning at the Democrat debate.
[03:28:48.385 --> 03:28:53.228]  She said, since their last debate in Las Vegas, there have been 3,000 people killed with guns.
[03:28:54.068 --> 03:28:55.368]  200 children.
[03:28:55.368 --> 03:28:56.969]  Nothing of the sort.
[03:28:56.969 --> 03:29:00.150]  Those numbers are totally made up, totally exaggerated.
[03:29:00.150 --> 03:29:04.791]  She said there's been 21 mass shootings since their last debate.
[03:29:04.791 --> 03:29:05.311]  No.
[03:29:05.311 --> 03:29:06.412]  There's been one.
[03:29:06.412 --> 03:29:07.232]  There's been one.
[03:29:07.232 --> 03:29:10.273]  She mentioned that one by name and she said three people died in that one.
[03:29:10.273 --> 03:29:10.933]  No.
[03:29:10.933 --> 03:29:12.153]  One person died in that one.
[03:29:12.153 --> 03:29:15.374]  Everything she said about guns was a made-up lie.
[03:29:15.374 --> 03:29:20.156]  She harangued Bernie Sanders because he voted against a bill that would not
[03:29:21.141 --> 03:29:26.004]  Let people sue someone if they didn't do any negligence on products that they made.
[03:29:26.004 --> 03:29:26.905]  How about that?
[03:29:26.905 --> 03:29:27.485]  She's a lawyer.
[03:29:27.485 --> 03:29:28.286]  She knows better than that.
[03:29:28.286 --> 03:29:30.507]  Of course, she knows that she can get away with lying.
[03:29:30.507 --> 03:29:31.588]  She can get away with murder.
[03:29:31.588 --> 03:29:41.355]  When we come back, we're going to talk about Bernie Sandinista's big lie and the programs that he wants to enact that he has no idea.
[03:29:41.355 --> 03:29:43.856]  He admits he has no idea how much these programs are going to cost.
[03:29:43.856 --> 03:29:44.497]  Stay with us.
[03:29:44.497 --> 03:29:47.299]  We'll be right back and we'll talk about Janet Yellen and the Fed.
[03:29:47.839 --> 03:29:49.220]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.220 --> 03:29:51.762]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.762 --> 03:29:58.526]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.526 --> 03:30:07.872]  In early October of this year, Matt Drudge paid a visit to the Central Texas Command Center and made the following chilling statements concerning free speech and his own site, The Drudge Report.
[03:30:07.872 --> 03:30:11.394]  I had a Supreme Court Justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[03:30:11.394 --> 03:30:13.215]  I said, Matt, it's over for you.
[03:30:13.215 --> 03:30:15.677]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[03:30:15.677 --> 03:30:16.257]  You're out of there.
[03:30:16.357 --> 03:30:19.799]  Well now we have the words of FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai.
[03:30:19.799 --> 03:30:24.221]  He said, The FCC doesn't have the ability to regulate anything he says and we want to start tamping down on websites like that.
[03:30:36.007 --> 03:30:43.891]  There are a lot of people who just don't like the fact that the internet is a completely unregulated marketplace in terms of freedom of speech, Pi told the website Inside Sources.
[03:30:43.891 --> 03:30:50.415]  And there are some speech that people just don't like or they think that it should be regulated because it has an outsized effect on public discourse.
[03:30:50.415 --> 03:30:52.216]  And Drudge Report is one of those.
[03:30:52.216 --> 03:30:53.717]  Time is limited!
[03:30:53.717 --> 03:30:56.779]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:30:58.387 --> 03:31:01.850]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:31:01.850 --> 03:31:10.096]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:31:10.096 --> 03:31:15.520]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:31:15.520 --> 03:31:18.042]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[03:31:29.335 --> 03:31:31.556]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:31:31.556 --> 03:31:36.539]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[03:31:36.539 --> 03:31:39.822]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:31:39.822 --> 03:31:43.304]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:31:43.304 --> 03:31:45.005]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:31:45.285 --> 03:31:46.206]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[03:31:46.206 --> 03:31:47.407]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:31:47.407 --> 03:31:49.389]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[03:32:55.807 --> 03:33:05.275]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:05.275 --> 03:33:07.537]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:33:11.055 --> 03:33:12.339]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:12.339 --> 03:33:13.863]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[03:33:13.863 --> 03:33:17.774]  There's an article before we get to the Fed and some of the serious economic articles.
[03:33:17.774 --> 03:33:18.536]  There's an article that...
[03:33:19.324 --> 03:33:22.447]  Almost looks like it's coming out of The Onion, the satire magazine.
[03:33:22.447 --> 03:33:26.811]  German robot practices hitting humans to ensure their future safety.
[03:33:26.811 --> 03:33:41.123]  I mean, this is so indicative of the kind of sadomasochism that we have with our government and also with the way they're mechanizing these robots to take everything away from us.
[03:33:41.123 --> 03:33:43.405]  This is a German scientist named Roland Behrens.
[03:33:44.065 --> 03:33:47.808]  He wants to teach robots how not to kill humans.
[03:33:47.808 --> 03:33:53.472]  He says at first, though, he needs to know how hard they can hit before causing any serious damage.
[03:33:53.472 --> 03:33:58.175]  So they've actually got idiots who have signed up for this.
[03:33:58.175 --> 03:33:59.316]  Go ahead, hit me.
[03:33:59.316 --> 03:34:03.519]  Hit me with your best robot shot, okay?
[03:34:03.519 --> 03:34:10.424]  They say they need to be able to coexist with humans without hurting them, because evidently part of coexistence with us is going to be hitting us.
[03:34:11.175 --> 03:34:12.576]  They're hitting us, yeah.
[03:34:12.576 --> 03:34:14.096]  Just make sure that you don't hit them too hard.
[03:34:14.096 --> 03:34:21.520]  Look, we understand how robots are going to be used by DARPA, how they're going to be used by the police, how they're going to be used by the governments to control us.
[03:34:21.520 --> 03:34:21.960]  Okay?
[03:34:21.960 --> 03:34:23.041]  That's what this is about.
[03:34:23.041 --> 03:34:24.381]  Let's understand this.
[03:34:24.381 --> 03:34:26.863]  Let's get a clue here.
[03:34:26.863 --> 03:34:28.543]  This is coming from Engadget.
[03:34:28.543 --> 03:34:35.487]  They say they hit a group of volunteers on the arm or the shoulder so they can study the impact at the highest mass and the lowest velocity.
[03:34:35.487 --> 03:34:39.889]  And the team stops testing when the pain reaches level five.
[03:34:40.549 --> 03:34:42.110]  In a scale of 1 to 10.
[03:34:42.110 --> 03:34:47.054]  And the subjects are then put through ultrasound to check for bruises from the impact.
[03:34:47.054 --> 03:34:49.035]  They say, collaborative robots are on the rise.
[03:34:49.035 --> 03:34:50.757]  Yes, yes, they're here to help you.
[03:34:50.757 --> 03:34:51.937]  They're here to help you.
[03:34:51.937 --> 03:35:00.784]  All those robots that they've got, that they're teaching to run and climb and run faster than humans and all that sort of, those are there to help you.
[03:35:00.784 --> 03:35:08.730]  You know, in case we have some kind of a nuclear meltdown at a reactor or something, they need a robot that can run faster than a human.
[03:35:09.190 --> 03:35:14.657]  To run through the, you know, the nuclear reactor and shut down the control rods or whatever.
[03:35:14.657 --> 03:35:15.017]  Now look.
[03:35:15.819 --> 03:35:17.520]  You and I know what they're doing.
[03:35:17.520 --> 03:35:19.122]  They're creating Terminator machines.
[03:35:19.122 --> 03:35:21.083]  They're creating autonomous killer robots.
[03:35:21.083 --> 03:35:22.725]  They're creating swarms of drones.
[03:35:22.725 --> 03:35:23.485]  They've admitted it.
[03:35:23.485 --> 03:35:26.608]  We've talked about the documents.
[03:35:26.608 --> 03:35:28.149]  They've published some of the documents.
[03:35:28.149 --> 03:35:29.090]  Some of them have leaked out.
[03:35:29.090 --> 03:35:30.671]  We've talked about that.
[03:35:30.671 --> 03:35:37.897]  We know precisely where they're going with this, but yet, you've got the technological press that plays along with this imaginary scenario.
[03:35:37.897 --> 03:35:42.481]  Yes, they're here, and they're from the government, and they're here to help you.
[03:35:42.481 --> 03:35:45.263]  But first, they have to learn how hard they can hit you without killing you, okay?
[03:35:45.923 --> 03:35:53.345]  I mean, I go back and I look at, it's almost like the economic, as we switch over to economic news, it's almost like the Laffer curve.
[03:35:53.345 --> 03:35:54.185]  Remember Ronald Reagan?
[03:35:54.185 --> 03:35:56.325]  I had the economist author Laffer.
[03:35:56.325 --> 03:35:59.286]  And he came up with a bell-shaped curve.
[03:35:59.286 --> 03:36:07.207]  And he said, well, you know, as we increase tax revenue, as we increase the tax rate, the tax revenue goes up.
[03:36:07.207 --> 03:36:10.128]  And then it peaks and starts to drop off again.
[03:36:10.128 --> 03:36:13.189]  And so we want to get it right there at the top of the curve where it's maximized.
[03:36:13.189 --> 03:36:14.249]  And I was like, well, why don't we...
[03:36:15.902 --> 03:36:24.087]  Why is it that our objective, even under Ronald Reagan, was to see how hard the government could hit us economically without killing us?
[03:36:24.087 --> 03:36:25.288]  Okay?
[03:36:25.288 --> 03:36:27.469]  That's essentially what the Laffer Curve was about.
[03:36:27.469 --> 03:36:31.512]  I mean, it was genuine, it was for real, but that was essentially what that was about.
[03:36:32.432 --> 03:36:39.898]  That brings up what was, I think, one of the more interesting exchanges from the Democrat debate.
[03:36:39.898 --> 03:36:48.566]  And that was where the moderator asked Bernie Sanders, as he's going on and on, because all three of them, of course, all three of them want free college tuition for everyone.
[03:36:48.566 --> 03:36:49.286]  Free college tuition.
[03:36:49.286 --> 03:36:51.228]  So the moderator says, well, how are you going to pay for that?
[03:36:51.228 --> 03:36:54.371]  How much are the tax rates going to have to be for you to pay that?
[03:36:54.371 --> 03:36:55.652]  And Bernie Sanders says,
[03:36:56.229 --> 03:36:57.149]  Well, I don't know.
[03:36:57.149 --> 03:36:59.590]  We haven't run the numbers here, but it won't be more than 90%.
[03:36:59.590 --> 03:37:04.192]  We're not as big a socialist as Eisenhower was, okay?
[03:37:04.192 --> 03:37:06.873]  Well, that got a big round of applause.
[03:37:06.873 --> 03:37:09.094]  And then you had Governor O'Malley chime in.
[03:37:09.094 --> 03:37:11.315]  He goes, yes, yes, we can do this.
[03:37:11.315 --> 03:37:12.795]  We can raise taxes.
[03:37:12.795 --> 03:37:17.317]  I mean, even Ronald Reagan had a tax rate of 70% at the top.
[03:37:17.317 --> 03:37:18.557]  He didn't even say at the top.
[03:37:18.557 --> 03:37:19.618]  He said he had a tax rate of 70%.
[03:37:20.988 --> 03:37:27.611]  Okay, a lot of lies and a lot of distortion there, but think about what was at the very fundamental bottom of that.
[03:37:27.611 --> 03:37:36.574]  These guys who are proposing a new massive entitlement program have absolutely no idea, no idea, and they could care less how much this is going to cost.
[03:37:37.858 --> 03:37:39.280]  They could care less.
[03:37:39.280 --> 03:37:40.922]  Because they're socialists.
[03:37:40.922 --> 03:37:42.844]  And because this is an entitlement program.
[03:37:42.844 --> 03:37:46.629]  And they really don't have any idea of how much it's going to cost.
[03:37:46.629 --> 03:37:48.351]  Because understand what they're doing.
[03:37:48.351 --> 03:37:54.638]  They're offering right now, and this is not an exaggeration to say that they're offering free tuition to the entire world.
[03:37:55.239 --> 03:37:59.622]  To come here and be educated at the expense of the American taxpayer.
[03:37:59.622 --> 03:38:07.848]  That is precisely what Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, and Governor O'Malley, all the Democrats, want when they say, we want to have free college tuition for all.
[03:38:07.848 --> 03:38:13.493]  They're offering to educate the world at the expense of the American taxpayer.
[03:38:13.493 --> 03:38:22.960]  And if you don't believe that, consider the fact that illegal aliens come into the United States and they're able to get in-state college tuition at any state they wish to go to right now, under the Dreamer Act.
[03:38:24.121 --> 03:38:30.344]  They don't have a problem treating them better than they do American citizens and their parents who have paid taxes all their life.
[03:38:30.344 --> 03:38:32.225]  So, of course, they have no idea.
[03:38:32.225 --> 03:38:34.226]  Of course, they don't care about this.
[03:38:34.226 --> 03:38:50.295]  And, of course, Bernie Sandinista, the guy who loved the Nicaraguans, who loved Daniel Ortega, who went down in 1985 and bragged about what a humanitarian organization this was, the guy was nothing but the worst kind of kleptocrat, of crony capitalist, of thief.
[03:38:51.095 --> 03:38:52.377]  That you can find.
[03:38:52.377 --> 03:38:54.699]  As big a thief as anybody on Wall Street, if not bigger.
[03:38:54.699 --> 03:39:00.987]  He seized other people's assets and then when he was driven out by the communists and the conservatives, he kept those assets.
[03:39:00.987 --> 03:39:03.690]  He reprivatized those assets and kept them for his own.
[03:39:03.690 --> 03:39:06.213]  Now let's talk about who the real socialists are.
[03:39:06.213 --> 03:39:07.575]  The Democrats love FDR.
[03:39:08.601 --> 03:39:10.502]  Republicans love Ronald Reagan.
[03:39:10.502 --> 03:39:17.146]  And then in the middle of these guys, kind of halfway between their different administrations, was the Eisenhower administration.
[03:39:17.146 --> 03:39:20.208]  So what did FDR do for the working man?
[03:39:20.208 --> 03:39:23.931]  Well, when the working man, in 1933, when FDR came in, the working man had a rate of 4%.
[03:39:27.813 --> 03:39:32.735]  And these rates now, when I'm talking about dollar figures, these are normalized to 2013 figures.
[03:39:32.735 --> 03:39:35.215]  And that was a 4% rate all the way up to $70,000.
[03:39:35.215 --> 03:39:37.896]  So anybody that made $70,000 or less, they paid 4% income tax rate when FDR came in.
[03:39:37.896 --> 03:39:37.976]  Okay?
[03:39:43.380 --> 03:39:52.067]  Uh, when he finished, the minimum rate went up to 24% and it kicked in for everybody making, uh, and it escalated once you got to $24,000.
[03:39:52.067 --> 03:39:53.448]  So if you made $24,000 or less, it was 24%.
[03:39:53.448 --> 03:39:54.809]  If you made more than that, it was more.
[03:39:54.809 --> 03:39:55.009]  Okay?
[03:39:55.009 --> 03:39:58.132]  So his minimum rate for the working man was 4% and he jumped it to 24% in his 12 years in office.
[03:39:58.132 --> 03:39:58.652]  From 4 to 24%.
[03:40:08.340 --> 03:40:15.904]  Now Eisenhower, he began for the lowest rate that he had was 22% when he took office and when he left it was 20%.
[03:40:15.904 --> 03:40:21.166]  When Ronald Reagan came in, the lowest rate was 0% and when he left it was 15%.
[03:40:21.166 --> 03:40:23.627]  Actually went up on the lowest rate.
[03:40:23.627 --> 03:40:25.328]  But, if you look at the bigger picture,
[03:40:25.908 --> 03:40:41.728]  If you look at the the Reagan tax reforms and of course when O'Malley says it was 70% he was talking about the maximum rate that somebody would pay and let's go back and look at these maximum rates under FDR it was 63% if you had an income of 17 million dollars or more in one year.
[03:40:42.429 --> 03:40:46.172]  And then he dropped that level to $2.5 million and raised the rate to 94%.
[03:40:46.172 --> 03:40:51.817]  But he didn't hurt the median family as much, he didn't hurt the rich guys as much as he hurt the median family.
[03:40:51.817 --> 03:40:53.958]  It was essentially unchanged under Eisenhower.
[03:40:53.958 --> 03:40:57.021]  Under Reagan, the top rate was 70% if you made a half million, well $544,000.
[03:40:57.021 --> 03:40:59.223]  And then he dropped it to 28% for everybody that was making $57,000 or more.
[03:40:59.223 --> 03:41:01.044]  So Reagan took a complicated system that had 16 tax brackets,
[03:41:08.550 --> 03:41:12.091]  The highest tax bracket was a pretty high rate, and what he did was he gave you two tax brackets.
[03:41:12.091 --> 03:41:15.072]  You make less than $57,000, you add 15%.
[03:41:15.072 --> 03:41:16.573]  More than $50,000, it was 28%.
[03:41:16.573 --> 03:41:25.256]  And I want to get off of this subject, because everybody's listening to numbers, this is radio, but just think about what happens to the median family income.
[03:41:25.256 --> 03:41:27.997]  The median family income today is just, I think it's $51,000.
[03:41:27.997 --> 03:41:32.598]  I didn't write it on my sheet here, but from memory, here it is, $51.9.
[03:41:32.598 --> 03:41:34.659]  So let's say $52,000.
[03:41:34.659 --> 03:41:37.420]  How would that family be taxed under FDR at the beginning?
[03:41:37.540 --> 03:41:44.083]  Well, that median family income, and again, half the people make less than this, half the people make more than this.
[03:41:44.083 --> 03:41:48.925]  Under FDR, their taxes would have gone from 4% to 29%.
[03:41:48.925 --> 03:41:52.887]  Under Eisenhower, that median family, their taxes would have gone from 34% to 22%, gone down.
[03:41:52.887 --> 03:41:56.588]  Under Reagan, they would have gone from 28% to 15%.
[03:41:56.588 --> 03:41:57.368]  It would have dropped in half.
[03:42:01.291 --> 03:42:08.375]  So when Bernie Sanders talks about Eisenhower being a socialist, no, he dropped rates from 34 to 22 percent.
[03:42:08.375 --> 03:42:09.615]  Reagan dropped them in half.
[03:42:09.615 --> 03:42:22.001]  But understand that when FDR put this in, when FDR raised the taxes on the median family from 4 percent to 29 percent, at the same time, he enacted Social Security, which was a lie from the very beginning.
[03:42:22.001 --> 03:42:23.842]  It was a lie when Bismarck did it in Germany.
[03:42:23.842 --> 03:42:27.384]  They picked 65 years because they knew that that was a life expectancy.
[03:42:27.384 --> 03:42:30.806]  They didn't expect people to survive that long, so they didn't think they'd have to pay out.
[03:42:31.499 --> 03:42:32.940]  So it was a Ponzi scheme.
[03:42:32.940 --> 03:42:47.691]  And now we've got Republicans and Democrats trying to turn it into outright theft and fraud, having forced people to contribute to this for their entire life, and then pulling the rug out from under them and saying, well, we're not going to give you that money because we have decided that you don't need it.
[03:42:47.691 --> 03:42:48.632]  Thanks a lot.
[03:42:48.632 --> 03:42:49.672]  Thanks a lot.
[03:42:49.672 --> 03:42:51.394]  Understand as well that FDR
[03:42:51.914 --> 03:43:04.209]  That wonderful socialist, that champion of the working man, who raised their taxes from 4% to 29% income taxes, put on them, Social Security, the most regressive tax, if you want to use the language of the left.
[03:43:04.209 --> 03:43:06.933]  Regressive means that it falls on the poorest people most heavily.
[03:43:08.413 --> 03:43:16.995]  Anybody who makes, and I don't know what the upper limit is, I've never gotten to a point where I don't have to pay Social Security, but the upper limit is like $107 or something like this, okay?
[03:43:16.995 --> 03:43:19.836]  So if you make more than that, you don't have to pay any more Social Security.
[03:43:19.836 --> 03:43:26.298]  But everybody that makes below that, you see it on your paycheck as 7.5%, actually 7.62%.
[03:43:26.298 --> 03:43:32.140]  But the reality is, the cost to your employer is over 15.5%, because half of it is paid by the employer.
[03:43:32.140 --> 03:43:33.180]  You don't see that on your check.
[03:43:33.979 --> 03:43:49.673]  So the reality is, is that for all the people who made less than six-figure incomes, you're paying 15% in Social Security plus, and that's thank you FDR, and plus you got an extra 25% boost on your income taxes.
[03:43:49.673 --> 03:43:51.815]  That's what the socialists do to the working man.
[03:43:52.608 --> 03:43:57.410]  That's what they do, and we can see that in Venezuela, where they got a 700% return on investment.
[03:43:57.410 --> 03:44:14.279]  Bloomberg Press was bragging about how they were getting a 700% return on investment from Nicaragua at the same time, and in that same article, bragging about their massive return on investment, saying people had to leave that country in order to get food, water, and medicine, because they had to pay the bankers first.
[03:44:14.279 --> 03:44:20.882]  See, that's why the bankers sent Lenin in with $10 million in gold on his train to start a communist revolution.
[03:44:21.786 --> 03:44:32.390]  They've been behind this, they've been running both sides of this because they make a tremendous amount of money in these little socialist utopias that Bernie Sanders is telling you is so good for you.
[03:44:32.390 --> 03:44:33.511]  And this is how it's going to work out.
[03:44:33.511 --> 03:44:37.592]  It's going to work out for the working man like it did with FDR in terms of tax rates.
[03:44:37.592 --> 03:44:41.894]  Now, one of the instruments that they use to do this is Janet Yellen's Fed.
[03:44:41.894 --> 03:44:48.277]  Janet Yellen, the chairperson of the Federal Reserve, and she is pushing back now against the FORM Act.
[03:44:49.097 --> 03:44:52.278]  This is something that has been proposed in Congress.
[03:44:52.278 --> 03:44:58.600]  Rand Paul is involved in this, a sponsor, I think, in the Senate, as well as there's a sponsor in the House.
[03:44:58.600 --> 03:44:59.620]  They're trying to ram this through.
[03:44:59.620 --> 03:45:02.922]  So the Federal Reserve is out there hiring lobbyists.
[03:45:02.922 --> 03:45:03.662]  Hiring lobbyists.
[03:45:03.662 --> 03:45:05.702]  And Rand Paul commented on that.
[03:45:05.702 --> 03:45:13.445]  He tried to offer yet another bill to say, look, we're not going to let the Federal Reserve use money that they make off the American people.
[03:45:14.085 --> 03:45:16.267]  To lobby Congress.
[03:45:16.267 --> 03:45:22.933]  He made, if it was reported correctly, I think a very inaccurate statement saying the Federal Reserve is a government agency.
[03:45:22.933 --> 03:45:23.834]  No, they aren't.
[03:45:23.834 --> 03:45:25.355]  They're a private organization.
[03:45:25.355 --> 03:45:27.197]  They've been given powers by the government.
[03:45:27.197 --> 03:45:28.838]  They've been given a monopoly by the government.
[03:45:28.838 --> 03:45:31.721]  They're not a government agency, and he knows that.
[03:45:31.721 --> 03:45:34.363]  So, hopefully he just misspoke on that.
[03:45:34.363 --> 03:45:35.284]  We'll see what happens.
[03:45:35.284 --> 03:45:40.428]  But nevertheless, the FORM Act attempts to increase transparency and accountability.
[03:45:40.428 --> 03:45:40.889]  Increase it.
[03:45:42.060 --> 03:45:42.461]  You know what?
[03:45:42.461 --> 03:45:44.002]  There is no transparency.
[03:45:44.002 --> 03:45:47.405]  There is absolutely no accountability to the Fed.
[03:45:47.405 --> 03:45:52.450]  Once the chairman is in, he comes back and he tells Congress what he's going to do.
[03:45:52.450 --> 03:45:56.273]  And if they don't like it, he doesn't care.
[03:45:56.273 --> 03:45:58.235]  I mean, that's what we saw with Greenspan.
[03:45:58.235 --> 03:45:59.356]  That's what we saw with Bernanke.
[03:45:59.356 --> 03:46:01.598]  That's what we're going to see with Yellen.
[03:46:01.598 --> 03:46:02.979]  They do whatever they wish.
[03:46:02.979 --> 03:46:05.621]  They will tell Congress, to some degree, what they're going to do.
[03:46:05.621 --> 03:46:07.963]  But if you ask too many questions, they'll say, no, I'm not going to talk about that.
[03:46:08.604 --> 03:46:10.985]  And I'm not going to show you my books, either.
[03:46:10.985 --> 03:46:13.826]  They said the Fed Oversight Reform and Modernization Act.
[03:46:13.826 --> 03:46:15.367]  That's what FORM means.
[03:46:15.367 --> 03:46:17.187]  Okay, they always love these little acronyms.
[03:46:17.187 --> 03:46:18.228]  It's kind of silly.
[03:46:18.228 --> 03:46:20.269]  I wish they wouldn't do that in the Pentagon.
[03:46:20.269 --> 03:46:21.369]  You know, like the Patriot Act.
[03:46:21.369 --> 03:46:25.030]  Anyway, they said it could cause millions of Americans to suffer, says the Fed.
[03:46:25.030 --> 03:46:28.652]  And it would politicize monetary policy, said Janet Yellen.
[03:46:29.452 --> 03:46:30.392]  Imagine that.
[03:46:30.392 --> 03:46:32.893]  Politicizing monetary policy.
[03:46:32.893 --> 03:46:36.795]  As if that isn't what's already happening.
[03:46:36.795 --> 03:46:46.879]  I guess you could say it's not politicized because they get to do whatever they wish without any response whatsoever or any accountability to the American people, to the public.
[03:46:46.879 --> 03:46:52.561]  Now they say the proposed law in Congress would require the central bank to tie interest rate policy to a mathematical rule.
[03:46:53.755 --> 03:46:56.738]  Now, how is that politicizing it?
[03:46:56.738 --> 03:47:02.783]  If you've got a formula that you're going to set interest rates by, how would that politicize it?
[03:47:02.783 --> 03:47:03.724]  It doesn't.
[03:47:03.724 --> 03:47:10.290]  It basically ties the hands of these people who have been rigging and manipulating the markets since they were handed that power in 1913.
[03:47:12.697 --> 03:47:14.918]  And it's something we really need to keep up on.
[03:47:14.918 --> 03:47:16.958]  Look, you need to talk to your congressman.
[03:47:16.958 --> 03:47:20.139]  Tell them to push this form act.
[03:47:20.139 --> 03:47:21.239]  Tell them to sign up for this.
[03:47:21.239 --> 03:47:22.920]  And let me give you some more information on this.
[03:47:22.920 --> 03:47:29.162]  They say interest rates, of course, up or down depending on the readings of economic indicators like the jobless rate and inflation is what they're talking about.
[03:47:29.162 --> 03:47:33.043]  It's not really where we ultimately want to go, but it is a small step in the right direction.
[03:47:33.763 --> 03:47:42.645]  Other articles from the Wall Street Journal point out that it would also require the Fed to disclose more details about the stress tests that they give to banks.
[03:47:42.645 --> 03:47:47.406]  It would also give lawmakers more opportunities to scrutinize their policy.
[03:47:47.406 --> 03:47:58.748]  Federal officials are also concerned that the Government Accountability Office reviews of monetary policy decisions that the bill would allow could make the central bank vulnerable to political pressure.
[03:47:58.748 --> 03:47:59.888]  See?
[03:47:59.888 --> 03:48:01.949]  She says, wait, it's going to politicize the process.
[03:48:02.856 --> 03:48:04.778]  Okay.
[03:48:04.778 --> 03:48:15.186]  In reality, what it would do is it would really set up an algorithm for the interest rates, and it would expose them to some transparency, which is desperately needed.
[03:48:15.186 --> 03:48:20.711]  And they say last year, this actually made it through the House, but it died in the Senate when the Senate was under Democrat control.
[03:48:20.711 --> 03:48:24.714]  So there's a possibility that this may go through this year.
[03:48:24.714 --> 03:48:26.896]  So here's a chance for you to jump in.
[03:48:28.103 --> 03:48:33.067]  Now, in the time that we've got left, I want to talk a little bit about what's going on, of course, with our open borders.
[03:48:33.067 --> 03:48:41.814]  And we've talked about this endlessly, but we can't stress it enough that this is about taking down our country, taking down Western Europe.
[03:48:41.814 --> 03:48:45.437]  And I just want to give you some of the things that are happening right now.
[03:48:45.437 --> 03:48:57.087]  Besides the situation with Syria, we have Cuban migrants, a massive wave of Cuban migrants coming through Central America to the United States because they get special treatment.
[03:48:57.427 --> 03:48:58.188]  Of all other people.
[03:48:58.188 --> 03:49:03.433]  They get treated better than Mexicans, they get treated better than Nicaraguans, than anybody else in Central America.
[03:49:03.433 --> 03:49:07.216]  There's a special place in our government's heart for Cubans.
[03:49:07.216 --> 03:49:11.801]  And we have Cubans running for president right now that came in that in my opinion don't
[03:49:12.301 --> 03:49:12.881]  We're good to go.
[03:49:30.131 --> 03:49:31.371]  And what are they doing now?
[03:49:31.371 --> 03:49:41.454]  Well, Nicaragua is dispatching its military and its police to help close its southern borders in a dispute with Costa Rica over the passage of Cuban migrants on their way to the U.S.
[03:49:41.454 --> 03:49:44.195]  These are not even people that would be staying in Nicaragua.
[03:49:44.195 --> 03:49:46.636]  They don't even want to allow these people to pass through.
[03:49:46.636 --> 03:49:48.016]  So what did they do?
[03:49:48.016 --> 03:49:52.138]  Well, Costa Rica decided on Saturday to grant a seven-day transit visa.
[03:49:52.138 --> 03:49:56.419]  They had 1,200 Cuban migrants who went into Costa Rica through Panama.
[03:49:57.379 --> 03:50:01.984]  And Nicaragua is saying, wait a minute, you're violating our national sovereignty.
[03:50:01.984 --> 03:50:09.370]  Ooh, they sound like American governors who are talking about national sovereignty being violated.
[03:50:09.370 --> 03:50:12.834]  I mean, this is something the left must really hate Nicaragua right now.
[03:50:13.530 --> 03:50:19.574]  Nicaragua's government said in a statement over the weekend that it violated their national sovereignty, and then they sent out troops and riot police.
[03:50:19.574 --> 03:50:24.997]  They fired tear gas at people who were trying to enter Nicaragua on Sunday.
[03:50:24.997 --> 03:50:26.838]  So they take their borders seriously.
[03:50:26.838 --> 03:50:28.860]  They take their national sovereignty seriously.
[03:50:29.620 --> 03:50:34.422]  How politically incorrect of our Sandinistas down there.
[03:50:34.422 --> 03:50:38.364]  And they point out that this has all spiked since Obama has changed the status.
[03:50:38.364 --> 03:50:44.187]  They're giving special status to people coming in from Cuba, even though we are now embracing the Cubans.
[03:50:44.187 --> 03:50:51.571]  And Obama praises the Cuban dreamers in Spanish, saying, this is the opening of the U.S.
[03:50:51.571 --> 03:50:52.932]  In case you've got any doubts about it.
[03:50:52.932 --> 03:50:53.852]  Stay with us when we come back.
[03:50:53.852 --> 03:50:57.214]  We're going to talk about the solution to this, the Kentucky Resolutions.
[03:50:57.214 --> 03:50:58.174]  The 217th anniversary was yesterday.
[03:50:59.395 --> 03:51:01.377]  My name is Don Whiskin.
[03:51:01.377 --> 03:51:06.342]  In 1994, I lost my 62-year-old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:51:06.342 --> 03:51:10.366]  In 1977, my 44-year-old brother was found dead in his apartment.
[03:51:10.366 --> 03:51:11.908]  He suffered a heart attack.
[03:51:11.908 --> 03:51:15.812]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed.
[03:51:15.812 --> 03:51:20.597]  21 days later, my 53-year-old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital.
[03:51:20.597 --> 03:51:21.438]  He waited too long.
[03:51:21.858 --> 03:51:25.199]  In June, that same year, I almost joined them at 42.
[03:51:25.199 --> 03:51:26.099]  What did I do?
[03:51:26.099 --> 03:51:33.561]  I took a 7-herb formula I now call ExtendoVite made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, hawthorn, milk thistle, and valerian.
[03:51:33.561 --> 03:51:41.982]  Based on German studies of natural medicine, ExtendoVite is designed to clear blocked arteries, clean the toxins from your blood, and improve your immune system.

[03:54:09.853 --> 03:54:11.073]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:11.073 --> 03:54:11.593]  I'm David Knight.
[03:54:11.593 --> 03:54:22.656]  In this last segment of Overdrive, we're going to talk about the solution to Obama's bringing in massive numbers of refugees from Syria and elsewhere.
[03:54:22.656 --> 03:54:26.157]  It's the Kentucky Resolution aspect of this.
[03:54:26.157 --> 03:54:35.819]  We had the 217th anniversary yesterday, and we're going to look at that and see what that tells us about the true political power in this country, where it rightfully resides.
[03:54:35.819 --> 03:54:37.760]  Before we do, real quickly, I just want to let you know that we have
[03:54:38.280 --> 03:54:45.722]  Knockout on sale, a new special, 15% off at Infowarslife.com for the same price as some supplements that only contain melatonin.
[03:54:45.722 --> 03:54:54.865]  Knockout includes valerian root extract and melatonin and chamomile flower extract, hops flower extract, L-tryptophan, and many other key ingredients.
[03:54:54.865 --> 03:55:01.407]  That's normally at the same price as other supplements, but now you can get it at 15% off at Infowarslife.com.
[03:55:01.407 --> 03:55:02.908]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[03:55:04.195 --> 03:55:11.603]  Now as you look at articles that are up on Infowars.com, Obama says the number of refugees from Syria and elsewhere will be increased to $100,000 per year for at least, I'm sorry, 100,000 immigrants each year.
[03:55:11.603 --> 03:55:14.327]  They're going to be a lot more than $100,000, let me tell you that.
[03:55:19.652 --> 03:55:33.365]  He says, and of course he's backed up by John Kerry, Secretary of State, saying that the 10,000 refugees is actually a floor, not a ceiling, and they're going to take in 100,000 from Syria is their goal, at least for the next two years.
[03:55:33.365 --> 03:55:34.907]  And those are just the people that we're going to fly in.
[03:55:35.467 --> 03:55:38.789]  The rest of them, you know, they can walk across the borders.
[03:55:38.789 --> 03:55:40.390]  We saw Joe Biggs do.
[03:55:40.390 --> 03:55:52.718]  They can even wear their ISIS balaclavas and carry a severed head with them and walk across the border as Joe Biggs did and nobody will bother them because they're wide open, just as Obama was telling the Cubans.
[03:55:52.718 --> 03:55:54.979]  Welcome, you know, this is the opening of America.
[03:55:55.279 --> 03:55:58.123]  Yeah, the opening to what, we need to ask.
[03:55:58.123 --> 03:56:00.346]  Especially in light of what we've seen happening in Europe.
[03:56:00.346 --> 03:56:01.648]  This was predicted.
[03:56:01.648 --> 03:56:02.769]  We all knew this was going to happen.
[03:56:02.769 --> 03:56:08.356]  We've seen it fulfilled now and yet it is still full speed ahead for the open border globalists.
[03:56:09.397 --> 03:56:14.863]  They're now opening facilities in the Middle East to speed up processing of Syrian refugees.
[03:56:14.863 --> 03:56:18.307]  They're going to open up a refugee settlement processing center in Iraq before the end of 2015.
[03:56:18.307 --> 03:56:22.612]  They'll resume refugee processing in Lebanon in early 2016.
[03:56:22.612 --> 03:56:25.375]  So they're ramping all of this stuff up.
[03:56:25.375 --> 03:56:26.416]  So how do we stop this?
[03:56:26.516 --> 03:56:40.791]  Because we saw over the weekend first it started out with six governors saying you're not going to put them in my state and we had yesterday went from 21 now it is over 25 and of course as they escalated the last two states were Massachusetts and Maine.
[03:56:40.791 --> 03:56:49.399]  I know Massachusetts is a Democrat I think Maine is as well I'm pretty certain it is and yet you see when the New York Times talks about this they talk about
[03:56:50.380 --> 03:56:52.081]  This is mostly Republican governors.
[03:56:52.081 --> 03:56:53.081]  No, it's not.
[03:56:53.081 --> 03:56:54.902]  That's the way they want to spin it.
[03:56:54.902 --> 03:57:00.104]  And, of course, the President says it would be a betrayal of our values.
[03:57:00.104 --> 03:57:01.264]  That's his values.
[03:57:01.264 --> 03:57:02.405]  It's not our values.
[03:57:02.405 --> 03:57:03.925]  It's not the law of our country.
[03:57:03.925 --> 03:57:07.707]  That is what Obama is unilaterally, unconstitutionally doing.
[03:57:07.707 --> 03:57:13.209]  And if we had a real opposition party in Washington, they would have impeached him by now.
[03:57:13.209 --> 03:57:15.829]  But, of course, they're just a pretend opposition party.
[03:57:15.829 --> 03:57:16.790]  How do we really stop this?
[03:57:17.310 --> 03:57:22.397]  It was a great article on New American, the 217th anniversary signing of the Kentucky Resolution of 1798.
[03:57:22.397 --> 03:57:23.799]  What we have forgotten.
[03:57:23.799 --> 03:57:26.924]  And I want to go over this article because it's very important.
[03:57:26.924 --> 03:57:33.192]  And of course what happened was, this is in response to the Alien and Sedition Act that were put in by John Adams in the summer of 1798.
[03:57:34.724 --> 03:57:40.947]  What that meant was, let's look at the, well, first of all, the Alien Acts was exactly the opposite of what our president is doing right now.
[03:57:40.947 --> 03:57:44.008]  It gave power to the president to declare foreign residents in the U.S.
[03:57:44.008 --> 03:57:46.929]  to be enemies of the state and have them jailed or deported.
[03:57:46.929 --> 03:57:49.390]  Just the opposite of what our president does right now.
[03:57:49.390 --> 03:57:52.412]  But it also had something else that was very troubling.
[03:57:52.412 --> 03:57:53.752]  That was the Sedition Act.
[03:57:53.752 --> 03:57:54.573]  Ah, I'm out of time!
[03:57:55.533 --> 03:57:57.615]  We're going to have the Nightly News tonight at 7.
[03:57:57.615 --> 03:57:59.096]  Maybe we'll cover this tonight.
[03:57:59.096 --> 03:58:03.438]  But what happened was they actually would jail people for criticizing the government.
[03:58:03.438 --> 03:58:06.260]  What was the rightful resolution of this?
[03:58:06.260 --> 03:58:10.043]  Jefferson, Madison said, the power resides in the states.
[03:58:10.043 --> 03:58:11.664]  That's where we have to fight this.
[03:58:11.664 --> 03:58:16.707]  We've got governors like Greg Abbott and others who will stand up and fight this.
[03:58:16.707 --> 03:58:20.110]  That's what we need to do is fight it at the state level.
[03:58:20.110 --> 03:58:22.691]  Join us tonight at 7, Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:22.691 --> 03:58:23.692]  Eastern for the Nightly News.
[03:58:23.692 --> 03:58:24.973]  Leanne McAdoo will be the host then.
