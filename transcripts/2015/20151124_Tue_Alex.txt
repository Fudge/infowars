[00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.918]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:16.457]  Big Brother.
[00:00:17.137 --> 00:00:18.158]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:19.999]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.461]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:23.142]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.803 --> 00:00:27.446]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:32.049]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.692 --> 00:00:37.972]  Well, I was up at 5 a.m.
[00:00:37.992 --> 00:00:45.276]  this morning trying to figure out exactly what's happening with the ongoing, unraveling crisis that threatens World War IV.
[00:00:46.276 --> 00:00:50.158]  The Cold War was World War III, ladies and gentlemen, in and around Syria.
[00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:55.701]  And I have to tell you, Vladimir Putin's statement of events of what happened is very accurate.
[00:00:56.973 --> 00:01:08.164]  Russian jets for a maximum of nine seconds may have been flying directly with GPS guidance on the border between Syria and Turkey.
[00:01:08.725 --> 00:01:17.193]  Turkey has been injecting troops for almost five years, paramilitaries, Al-Qaeda forces into Syria.
[00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:20.576]  Turkey is absolutely the bad guy in this.
[00:01:21.704 --> 00:01:35.397]  And they've now, with two USF-16s, shot down the Russian fighter bomber, and they've taken credit Turkish militias that came across the border with killing the pilots.
[00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:41.703]  This could escalate into a World War III type situation, World War IV type situation very quickly.
[00:01:42.024 --> 00:01:44.026]  Here's Vladimir Putin breaking it down.
[00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:54.206]  This is not... This goes beyond the framework of the regular fight against terrorism.
[00:01:54.306 --> 00:02:02.772]  Certainly our military men are fighting terrorism, sacrificing their own lives.
[00:02:03.293 --> 00:02:06.795]  But today's loss is related with the stab in our back
[00:02:15.651 --> 00:02:17.392]  By the associates of terrorism.
[00:02:17.412 --> 00:02:20.852]  I cannot find another wording to what happened today.
[00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:24.633]  Our plane was shot down over the Syrian territory.
[00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:45.480]  The air-to-air missile came from F-16 Turkish warplane.
[00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:55.929]  It fell on the territory of Syria four kilometers away from the Turkish border.
[00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:06.275]  It was at an altitude of 6,000 meters, so one kilometer away from the Turkish border when it was hit.
[00:03:19.886 --> 00:03:28.950]  In any case, our pilots and our plane never threatened the Republic of Turkey in any way.
[00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:34.171]  This was an obvious fact.
[00:03:35.492 --> 00:03:38.313]  They conducted an operation to fight ISIS.
[00:03:39.153 --> 00:03:41.655]  It was in Northern Latakia, that's a maintenance part.
[00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:43.175]  And that's where militants from Russia are located.
[00:03:57.185 --> 00:04:08.516]  And in that case, Russian pilots took preventive strikes against terrorists that could have come back to Russia at any moment.
[00:04:16.344 --> 00:04:26.172]  And these were the people who are considered, should be considered as international terrorists.
[00:04:28.094 --> 00:04:37.603]  We have long identified that there are a lot of oil and petrol products going to Turkey from the captured territories.
[00:04:38.683 --> 00:04:47.145]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:04:48.025 --> 00:04:49.326]  We're gonna come back with more of this.
[00:04:49.386 --> 00:04:51.046]  In fact, I may just back it up and play it again.
[00:04:51.206 --> 00:04:52.306]  Unprecedented statements.
[00:04:52.807 --> 00:04:55.327]  We've been stabbed in the back by the associates of the terrorists.
[00:04:55.787 --> 00:04:57.388]  Turkey's buying the Al-Qaeda oil.
[00:04:58.148 --> 00:04:58.668]  It's all true.
[00:05:00.107 --> 00:05:07.748]  And Turkey is there injecting brigades of terrorists in on a weekly basis and Russia bombs them.
[00:05:09.571 --> 00:05:18.855]  Global warming advocates are now blaming luxury condominiums for man-made climate change, despite the record-breaking snowfall which recently pounded the northern U.S.
[00:05:19.055 --> 00:05:26.459]  The Climate Words for All Coalition released a report claiming that luxury apartment buildings are the largest climate change offenders in New York City.
[00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:37.864]  These are New York City's largest buildings, over 50,000 square feet in size, which primarily consist of a mixture of luxury apartments, commercial buildings, and multifamily housing developments, the report stated.
[00:05:37.964 --> 00:05:42.548]  The report was released just as New York was being pounded by heavy snowstorms.
[00:05:42.908 --> 00:05:48.233]  Global warming advocates, however, will attempt to blame this record snowfall on man-made climate change.
[00:05:48.513 --> 00:05:54.198]  Even though a few years ago, they were predicting that the Earth's ice caps would have dramatically melted by now.
[00:05:54.478 --> 00:05:59.983]  But they really want you to live in a tiny apartment so they can cram more people into your neighborhood and tax the area.
[00:06:00.143 --> 00:06:02.485]  Keep up with our latest news and information.
[00:06:02.845 --> 00:06:08.558]  On InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.TV, and the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:21.154]  My fellow patriots, anyone that listens to my broadcast for any length of time knows that I can't stand Black Friday, a mindless, idiotic exercise in pure blind consumerism.
[00:06:21.474 --> 00:06:31.842]  I'm for prosperity, I'm for having good products that make our lives better, but I don't just mindlessly worship the holiday where we're supposedly getting the best deal ever, and statistics show it's one of the worst days to shop.
[00:06:32.062 --> 00:06:39.368]  That's why we are taking the InfoWar to the next level and actually making InfoWarStore.com Black Friday a super deal.

[00:07:09.321 --> 00:07:12.283]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[00:07:12.564 --> 00:07:22.211]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by Infowarslife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[00:07:37.003 --> 00:07:45.630]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:52.836]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigyrex herbal processing technique.
[00:07:52.976 --> 00:07:58.421]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best price.
[00:07:58.541 --> 00:08:02.043]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:30.507 --> 00:08:35.389]  I compare reality to the Matrix, the Twilight Zone, the Outer Limits.
[00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:36.570]  They live.
[00:08:39.872 --> 00:08:46.915]  But I came in this morning and I was talking to Nico and some of the other crew and I said, can you believe this is really happening?
[00:08:50.257 --> 00:08:58.241]  Can you really believe our government, NATO, the French, the Turkish government and others, have been
[00:08:59.995 --> 00:09:04.899]  Openly, for five years, ganging up on Syria, when Syria did nothing to anybody.
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:11.505]  Killing close to 300,000 people conservatively, mainly Christians and non-radical Muslims.
[00:09:13.747 --> 00:09:27.339]  And all these Arab states, and the Stans, and Pakistan, and Afghanistan, all the jihadis of the world, the Wahhabist jihadis, descending to bully on the secular government and army.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:36.064]  Blowing up police stations, blowing up churches, and our media calling them freedom fighters, and saying how great it is.
[00:09:36.684 --> 00:09:39.325]  Anderson Cooper, that praised the overthrow of Ukraine.
[00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:47.950]  Anderson Cooper, who praised the overthrow of the President of Egypt, four years ago.
[00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:54.834]  Who praised the overthrow of Gaddafi, so they could put Al-Qaeda in place to mass murder.
[00:09:56.536 --> 00:10:13.993]  And Turkey, more than anybody, has been giving physical intelligence, artillery support, aircraft support, the training camps for different fighting units from Chechnya and Pakistan, more than 20 countries.
[00:10:14.394 --> 00:10:19.319]  And they put them in brigades for combat training per country.
[00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:24.108]  So they fight as units, culturally, and they send them in.
[00:10:24.188 --> 00:10:29.530]  And Putin was bombing, on record, Chechens and others.
[00:10:33.872 --> 00:10:45.378]  Chechen training camps, right on the border, and with Russian intelligence, right as they're injecting their forces over the border, to come in and to fight.
[00:10:48.339 --> 00:10:51.562]  The anti-Al Qaeda, anti-ISIS coalition.
[00:10:53.764 --> 00:10:54.905]  Turkey shot down the plane.
[00:10:55.285 --> 00:11:03.032]  Russia has released, and we've got the maps up on Infowars.com, their radar map showing them for nine seconds on the border.
[00:11:04.313 --> 00:11:05.715]  On the border, not over the border.
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.242]  The Pentagon out of Baghdad has released
[00:11:15.302 --> 00:11:22.848]  Their trajectory, topography maps, showing it for maybe nine seconds a couple feet over.
[00:11:23.669 --> 00:11:39.982]  The point is, they had F-16s on them, made in the United States, trained by the United States, and they fired two missiles into the, how do I pronounce these, Sukhoi 24,
[00:11:41.323 --> 00:11:51.052]  Fighter-bomber aircraft, and then they shot, they're now taking responsibility, the pilots, the bomber and the pilot, as they drifted down on their parachutes.
[00:11:52.113 --> 00:11:53.033]  Another war crime.
[00:11:58.538 --> 00:12:08.207]  So if somebody did this to our pilots, we'd call them scum, but the Pentagon and our media and our controlled government is coming out defending all of this, and it's truly sickening.
[00:12:11.459 --> 00:12:13.559]  When you realize how militaristic Turkey is.
[00:12:13.959 --> 00:12:16.580]  Turkey, for large periods of time, ran the entire Middle East.
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.440]  Before that, it was the head of the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire.
[00:12:20.001 --> 00:12:24.701]  So it's very imperial, very militaristic, and it's actually spoiling for a ground war with Russia.
[00:12:24.921 --> 00:12:28.242]  It's got a huge military, and by the way, the Turkish army can fight.
[00:12:32.243 --> 00:12:34.063]  But what it doesn't have is the moral high ground.
[00:12:34.703 --> 00:12:38.544]  The government is on the verge of being toppled, but I can't even
[00:12:39.611 --> 00:12:44.255]  Explain to viewers and listeners, historically, how dangerous this is.
[00:12:44.715 --> 00:12:47.978]  This is how a World War I or a World War II starts.
[00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:51.861]  World War III was the Cold War, when you read the CIA annals.
[00:12:53.682 --> 00:12:57.545]  Now top strategists are saying this could easily trigger World War IV.
[00:12:58.466 --> 00:13:01.629]  What we keep saying, if somebody shoots down Russian aircraft, or if U.S.
[00:13:01.669 --> 00:13:06.793]  aircraft get shot down, or if Israeli aircraft get shot down, if somebody makes a mistake,
[00:13:08.353 --> 00:13:16.358]  And now Vladimir Putin's saying they will respond with serious action and will not tolerate this.
[00:13:19.039 --> 00:13:26.423]  Now, Turkey has bought on record $800 million of oil just in the last 12 months from ISIS alone.
[00:13:30.806 --> 00:13:35.649]  Turkey is literally sucking the money and the blood out of Syria.
[00:13:36.755 --> 00:13:45.161]  Turkey's government and its military is an Al-Qaeda aiding and abetting group of pig-like murderers.
[00:13:48.183 --> 00:13:54.228]  And Vladimir Putin has come out and said, you are, quote, stabbing us in the back.
[00:13:54.408 --> 00:13:58.591]  We have been stabbed in the back by the terrorist associates.
[00:14:00.657 --> 00:14:02.678]  Or translated, the supporters of the terrorists.
[00:14:03.058 --> 00:14:04.498]  And that is exactly what's going on.
[00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:08.280]  And he went on to say, you're buying the oil stolen, Turkey.
[00:14:10.801 --> 00:14:13.722]  It doesn't matter who Vladimir Putin is, whether he's a saint or a devil.
[00:14:13.822 --> 00:14:14.582]  That doesn't matter.
[00:14:15.163 --> 00:14:17.824]  The point is, the West started this war.
[00:14:18.264 --> 00:14:19.124]  It's in the wrong.
[00:14:19.384 --> 00:14:20.845]  It's been committing war crimes.
[00:14:21.185 --> 00:14:22.405]  Hundreds of thousands dead.
[00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:29.068]  And Sky News, the Fox propaganda arm, Fox TV in this country, and all the rest,
[00:14:30.481 --> 00:14:39.204]  are putting these maps up and saying, oh, they came into Turkish airspace for nine seconds.
[00:14:39.884 --> 00:14:41.684]  You know what wasn't in Turkish airspace?
[00:14:43.025 --> 00:14:49.787]  We've got video of this we're going to play right now for TV viewers, your radio listener, Infowars.com forward slash show to add the added dimension of video.
[00:14:52.748 --> 00:14:56.529]  We have a rescue helicopter marked with the
[00:14:58.402 --> 00:15:13.691]  Universal sign of a medical helicopter, the Cross, shot down as it came looking for the pilots.
[00:15:14.172 --> 00:15:15.953]  And guess what they shot down?
[00:15:16.773 --> 00:15:21.116]  The armored rescue helicopter.
[00:15:21.596 --> 00:15:23.317]  They admit this in the Associated Press.
[00:15:23.337 --> 00:15:24.478]  They set it up on video.
[00:15:26.368 --> 00:15:33.634]  A United States anti-tank tow missile, which they've given them thousands of.
[00:15:33.974 --> 00:15:35.095]  You know what else they've given them?
[00:15:36.976 --> 00:15:43.281]  Thousands, thousands of service-to-air MPADS.
[00:15:44.622 --> 00:15:45.863]  And there's the jihadis with U.S.
[00:15:46.423 --> 00:15:52.228]  taxpayer paid for, tow missile, shooting down the Russian helicopter.
[00:15:54.448 --> 00:16:00.173]  This isn't the 1980s where the Russians invade Afghanistan after Al-Qaeda-type groups attack them.
[00:16:00.853 --> 00:16:07.939]  And then, you know, we funded them with Stinger missiles, and oh, there are great Mujahideen, and then of course end up being supposedly involved in 9-11.
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.743]  This is now cut-and-dry Al-Qaeda committing war crimes in 2012, 13, 14, 15.
[00:16:20.891 --> 00:16:28.114]  Blowing up a Russian helicopter as it lands looking for the dead pilots.
[00:16:29.135 --> 00:16:38.819]  And there they are, in Turkey, over the border, a couple miles away, about to blow up the rescue helicopter, where they leave out the dead pilots as bait.
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:39.780]  Boom!
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.421]  You blew up the rescue helicopter!
[00:16:41.801 --> 00:16:42.461]  Great job!
[00:16:42.481 --> 00:16:43.582]  You killed some more people!
[00:16:44.802 --> 00:16:45.803]  Aren't you just special?
[00:16:46.735 --> 00:16:48.896]  We just showed that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:49.196 --> 00:16:53.078]  Here, let's show them jumping around and dragging the dead bodies of the pilots for everybody.
[00:16:54.539 --> 00:16:56.620]  The men fighting Al-Qaeda.
[00:16:57.481 --> 00:17:01.703]  Fighting the people clearly involved that just killed 137 people in Paris.
[00:17:03.224 --> 00:17:04.144]  Killing the people.
[00:17:04.464 --> 00:17:11.548]  We're told we've got to bend over to a proctology exam at the TSA so we're safe, but our borders are wide open.
[00:17:12.028 --> 00:17:13.509]  And Europe's borders are wide open.
[00:17:14.738 --> 00:17:21.960]  So a bunch of miscreant scum can come in and do whatever they want.
[00:17:25.181 --> 00:17:27.662]  This is truly over-the-top evil.
[00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:32.784]  NATO calls extraordinary meeting after Turkey downs Russian jet.
[00:17:33.404 --> 00:17:34.144]  These are the headlines.
[00:17:34.664 --> 00:17:36.445]  Russian pilot is killed.
[00:17:38.185 --> 00:17:40.126]  Turkmen militias admit.
[00:17:41.229 --> 00:17:45.051]  Russia will not tolerate such crimes as attacks on the aircraft.
[00:17:47.612 --> 00:17:50.193]  Putin rages as Turkey shoots down Russian plane.
[00:17:51.474 --> 00:17:59.018]  Putin, downing of jet, a stab in the back by those that aid the terrorists, or the accomplices of terrorists, depending on how you translate the Russian.
[00:18:01.721 --> 00:18:10.189]  But don't worry, Paris attacks spur emergency edict, basically martial law, banning protests, demonstrations, free speech, and intense policing in France.
[00:18:10.209 --> 00:18:10.810]  New York Times.
[00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:19.238]  Oh, you let them in, let them attack, and then you arrest the conservative party leader, Le Pen, because she criticized it.
[00:18:19.638 --> 00:18:23.182]  Oh, but the leftists can run around and burn things and beat police and they don't get in trouble.
[00:18:24.585 --> 00:18:26.027]  This is how the terrorists operate.
[00:18:26.047 --> 00:18:27.709]  The terrorists run France.
[00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.511]  The terrorists run England.
[00:18:29.752 --> 00:18:31.434]  The terrorists run the United States.
[00:18:31.734 --> 00:18:33.016]  The terrorists run Germany.
[00:18:33.256 --> 00:18:33.817]  They do.
[00:18:34.558 --> 00:18:36.320]  They're the ones shutting off our power plants.
[00:18:36.561 --> 00:18:38.243]  They're the ones shipping our jobs overseas.
[00:18:38.503 --> 00:18:42.749]  They're the ones messing with our five-year-olds, messing with their gender identity.
[00:18:44.551 --> 00:18:46.233]  We're under psychological war.
[00:18:46.253 --> 00:18:46.793]  Do you understand?
[00:18:47.194 --> 00:18:52.179]  Global warming taxes are a globalist military op to turn the energy off.
[00:18:52.499 --> 00:18:53.660]  How many years have I told you that?
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:59.746]  Watch Putin come out two weeks ago and says, this is a military operation against nation states and individuals to impoverish us.
[00:18:59.987 --> 00:19:01.708]  This is a military weapons system.
[00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.051]  That's exactly what it is.
[00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:08.730]  But as the world wakes up that we're under globalist attack.
[00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:10.831]  America's under globalist attack.
[00:19:11.091 --> 00:19:12.472]  Germany's under globalist attack.
[00:19:12.812 --> 00:19:14.113]  Russia's under globalist attack.
[00:19:14.713 --> 00:19:19.396]  But Russia, for all its corruption, doesn't want to commit suicide to the New World Order!
[00:19:20.876 --> 00:19:25.219]  At least their strongmen, kingpins over there, want a prosperous country.
[00:19:26.239 --> 00:19:27.680]  They're telling people to have kids.
[00:19:28.814 --> 00:19:31.039]  They got billboards up saying Russia's dying!
[00:19:31.079 --> 00:19:31.680]  Have kids!
[00:19:31.941 --> 00:19:32.662]  It is dying!
[00:19:32.802 --> 00:19:33.945]  The whole West is dying!
[00:19:34.265 --> 00:19:34.907]  Dying!
[00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:36.049]  Being killed!
[00:19:37.318 --> 00:19:43.121]  And Russia's on its knees bleeding out in front of everyone, but at least it's flopping around with the stab wounds all over it.
[00:19:43.621 --> 00:19:45.802]  Not America, not Germany, not France.
[00:19:46.162 --> 00:19:47.163]  The trendies all love it!
[00:19:47.243 --> 00:19:50.504]  They take the knives and just jab it in their kids' throats over and over again!
[00:19:50.524 --> 00:19:52.625]  And say, come to us, Al-Qaeda!
[00:19:52.665 --> 00:19:53.446]  Take us over!
[00:19:54.006 --> 00:19:54.946]  We are yours now!
[00:19:55.006 --> 00:19:56.547]  We want Stone Age filth!
[00:19:57.167 --> 00:19:58.748]  We want to destroy the Renaissance!
[00:19:59.108 --> 00:20:00.709]  We want to destroy classical music!
[00:20:00.969 --> 00:20:02.550]  We want to pull down the cathedrals!
[00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:03.791]  We want to be ugly!
[00:20:04.651 --> 00:20:05.892]  Because we're scumbags!
[00:20:06.493 --> 00:20:09.575]  We're devil worshippers!
[00:20:09.996 --> 00:20:12.998]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[00:20:13.298 --> 00:20:18.463]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[00:20:18.783 --> 00:20:20.684]  But they're about to lose control.
[00:20:21.065 --> 00:20:26.049]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[00:20:26.389 --> 00:20:30.853]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:20:30.953 --> 00:20:32.994]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:20:33.355 --> 00:20:36.857]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[00:20:37.197 --> 00:20:41.280]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:47.244]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves, but this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:20:47.444 --> 00:20:48.825]  This will affect us all.
[00:20:49.285 --> 00:20:52.787]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[00:20:54.008 --> 00:21:00.270]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.

[00:21:09.813 --> 00:21:21.341]  My fellow patriots, anyone that listens to my broadcast for any length of time knows that I can't stand Black Friday, a mindless, idiotic exercise in pure blind consumerism.
[00:21:21.661 --> 00:21:22.782]  I'm for prosperity.
[00:21:22.862 --> 00:21:25.083]  I'm for having good products that make our lives better.
[00:21:25.123 --> 00:21:29.626]  But I don't just mindlessly worship the holiday where we're supposedly getting the best deal ever.
[00:21:29.746 --> 00:21:32.008]  And statistics show it's one of the worst days to shop.
[00:21:32.228 --> 00:21:39.533]  That's why we are taking the InfoWar to the next level and actually making InfoWarStore.com Black Friday a super deal.

[00:23:08.604 --> 00:23:09.484]  Hey, Berkey Guy here.
[00:23:09.564 --> 00:23:11.264]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[00:23:11.404 --> 00:23:13.085]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?

[00:24:06.377 --> 00:24:07.177]  Come and take it.
[00:24:14.386 --> 00:24:16.327]  Riders on the storm.
[00:24:18.968 --> 00:24:21.029]  Riders on the storm.
[00:24:21.349 --> 00:24:23.810]  Into this world we're born.
[00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:25.471]  Into this house we're born.
[00:24:25.671 --> 00:24:27.712]  Into this world we're thrown.
[00:24:28.052 --> 00:24:29.693]  Into this world we're thrown.
[00:24:33.657 --> 00:25:00.212]  The people that run our government, that have hijacked it, that have occupied it, think we're so stupid and so distracted with the football coming up on Thanksgiving, and with the Kardashians, and with Caitlyn Jenner, that it's okay to gang up on a sovereign country for five years, murder upwards of 300,000 people,
[00:25:02.671 --> 00:25:05.373]  Shoot down Russian jets and say they deserve it.
[00:25:06.393 --> 00:25:08.434]  This isn't the first aircraft that's been shot down.
[00:25:10.395 --> 00:25:11.256]  Right on the border.
[00:25:13.017 --> 00:25:23.342]  And then have the Turkish-backed paramilitary with a US-made high-tech tow missile blow up a rescue helicopter, getting the dead bodies.
[00:25:24.403 --> 00:25:31.387]  You notice that these pilots ejected several miles into Syria.
[00:25:33.971 --> 00:25:37.694]  The aircraft was blown up on record over Syria.
[00:25:39.756 --> 00:25:47.583]  And Turkish aircraft routinely come in and bomb Syrian flagged military convoys.
[00:25:50.806 --> 00:25:56.571]  Turkey openly backs ISIS and openly backs
[00:25:57.506 --> 00:25:58.527]  The takedown of Assad.
[00:25:58.887 --> 00:26:09.438]  But our public is so illiterate, historically, so illiterate geopolitically, so illiterate about the Middle East, that I see news articles saying Iran is behind ISIS here in the U.S.
[00:26:11.179 --> 00:26:15.163]  The arch enemy of the Wahhabist is the Shiites.
[00:26:16.144 --> 00:26:18.607]  This is the abject mindlessness.
[00:26:19.527 --> 00:26:20.909]  This is so dangerous.
[00:26:23.644 --> 00:26:27.107]  Informed people barely know who the players are that I talk to.
[00:26:27.487 --> 00:26:28.708]  So-called informed people.
[00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:31.631]  This is crazy!
[00:26:34.393 --> 00:26:40.298]  And this is a major provocation against the Russians, and the Russians are saying there'll be serious consequences to Turkey.
[00:26:43.661 --> 00:26:47.884]  I wish America would get its soul back and wake up to this because it's shameful.
[00:26:50.306 --> 00:26:50.807]  Shameful.
[00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:55.050]  To see this type of activity going on.
[00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:56.911]  Because I've studied the Soviet Union.
[00:26:56.951 --> 00:26:58.991]  It did a lot of really nasty, horrible stuff.
[00:27:00.312 --> 00:27:01.492]  It was atheistic.
[00:27:01.552 --> 00:27:02.652]  It was anti-family.
[00:27:02.712 --> 00:27:04.232]  It was anti-Christian.
[00:27:06.113 --> 00:27:11.974]  But if you look at the mindsets and the foundations that set up the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 with V.I.
[00:27:12.474 --> 00:27:20.036]  Lenin, it's the very same grandchildren and the very same people of that very brain trust.
[00:27:23.049 --> 00:27:24.830]  That are running America today.
[00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.232]  And you can't teach old dogs new tricks.
[00:27:28.272 --> 00:27:30.593]  They're running the same nasty crap.
[00:27:31.834 --> 00:27:32.894]  And it's so immoral.
[00:27:32.954 --> 00:27:35.316]  It's all about raw evil power.
[00:27:35.916 --> 00:27:39.138]  All about Machiavelli and Injustifies the Means.
[00:27:45.021 --> 00:27:46.882]  Remember when he was on 60 Minutes, George Soros?
[00:27:47.822 --> 00:27:47.902]  In 1999?
[00:27:50.689 --> 00:28:01.672]  He was admitting he helped round people up and helped find Jews that were hiding and send them to forced labor camps.
[00:28:04.753 --> 00:28:07.394]  And he told the interviewer, he said, well, I did what I had to do to survive.
[00:28:08.014 --> 00:28:08.994]  So I'm not sorry.
[00:28:09.014 --> 00:28:10.915]  That's a quote.
[00:28:12.916 --> 00:28:13.656]  And I have no guilt.
[00:28:16.097 --> 00:28:16.957]  He's not sorry.
[00:28:16.997 --> 00:28:17.497]  He loves it.
[00:28:20.253 --> 00:28:24.856]  And George Soros then sided with the right-wing Nazis in Ukraine to start a new war there.
[00:28:25.176 --> 00:28:25.556]  On record!
[00:28:25.737 --> 00:28:33.542]  That actually, their leader, Heil Hitler, the vice president that they put in was heiling Hitler on TV.
[00:28:36.343 --> 00:28:38.885]  But they went further than crazy Nazi iconography.
[00:28:40.006 --> 00:28:42.347]  They had like weird things with
[00:28:43.695 --> 00:28:47.277]  Aryan princesses, Valkyries shooting electricity out of their fingers.
[00:28:47.758 --> 00:28:50.239]  That's what he would give speeches with that behind him.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.741]  Women shooting lightning bolts out of their fingers.
[00:28:53.501 --> 00:29:01.807]  Some crazy, weird Nazi collaborator, leftist Jew, funding people, hiling Hitler with electricity shooting out of their fingers.
[00:29:02.227 --> 00:29:04.309]  This is the whacked out, crazy town?
[00:29:05.409 --> 00:29:13.833]  And our government's saying Russia deserved what it got, and then there's video of them blowing up the rescue helicopter almost two miles inside Syria?
[00:29:15.534 --> 00:29:17.034]  This is what we've become?
[00:29:17.434 --> 00:29:18.535]  This is who we are?
[00:29:19.395 --> 00:29:20.656]  You say, well, we're not doing this.
[00:29:20.696 --> 00:29:21.216]  Well, you know what?
[00:29:21.256 --> 00:29:22.957]  We let these crazy crooks do it.
[00:29:26.738 --> 00:29:27.879]  Let's go out to break with Putin.
[00:29:28.039 --> 00:29:32.321]  Again, the quote about, we were stabbed in the back by the accomplices of terrorists.
[00:29:32.341 --> 00:29:32.641]  Here it is.
[00:29:34.572 --> 00:29:42.774]  This is not, this goes beyond the framework of the regular fight against terrorism.
[00:29:42.814 --> 00:29:50.917]  Certainly our military men are fighting terrorism, sacrificing their own lives.
[00:29:51.916 --> 00:29:55.279]  Sacrificing themselves and their powers.
[00:29:55.359 --> 00:29:59.102]  But today's loss is related with you.
[00:30:09.767 --> 00:30:17.513]  Man-made climate change is largely a myth promoted by politicians to scare the public into accepting a vast expansion of government to supposedly stop global warming.
[00:30:17.633 --> 00:30:25.820]  Global warming is a manufactured problem played up by the government to instigate a public reaction, in this case fear, the government then exploits to offer a predetermined solution.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:34.066]  This strategy, now known as the Hegelian dialectic, has been used successfully by politicians for millennia to expand government which can only grow at the expense of individual liberties.
[00:30:34.246 --> 00:30:47.095]  The Bush administration used this strategy successfully in 2003 when it gained enough public support for the invasion of Iraq by claiming the country had weapons of mass destruction, and the war ultimately expanded the military-industrial complex in America's emerging police state.
[00:30:47.275 --> 00:31:01.245]  Today, global warming is used as a boogeyman because it allows the UN to use government-funded scientists to scare the public into believing that man-made climate change is too big of a threat for their country to handle alone, and thus it can only be defeated through the expansion of the UN at the expense of their nation's sovereignty.
[00:31:01.465 --> 00:31:06.308]  The number one goal of an out-of-control government is not to protect you, but rather to gain more power at your expense.
[00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:08.750]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com.
[00:31:09.591 --> 00:31:10.972]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:31:10.992 --> 00:31:12.553]  You can't survive without it.
[00:31:12.733 --> 00:31:13.634]  But where do you get it?

[00:33:00.589 --> 00:33:05.111]  We've got one of the head honchos of Campaign for Liberty in the last 30 minutes, Norm Singleton.
[00:33:25.091 --> 00:33:31.174]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:31.434 --> 00:33:33.876]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.416 --> 00:33:37.938]  Norm Singleton to move us the last 30 minutes of the three hours I host.
[00:33:38.638 --> 00:33:48.123]  And then of course we've got in the fourth hour coming up today, Jakari Jackson will be hosting with a bunch of breaking news at that time and more.
[00:33:49.384 --> 00:33:53.686]  So as we get closer to him taking over, I'll let you know what he's going to be covering, because we don't know until right beforehand.
[00:33:54.366 --> 00:33:57.447]  I do need to get into science and tech, immigration, economy, U.S.
[00:33:57.507 --> 00:34:04.869]  news, politics, the big InfoWars stack of just crazy tyranny, political correctness, Black Friday news, special reports.
[00:34:04.989 --> 00:34:05.870]  It's all jam-packed.
[00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:11.692]  But everyone can see now the world's going into design crisis.
[00:34:12.532 --> 00:34:14.933]  Anyone that's halfway paying attention can see that.
[00:34:16.451 --> 00:34:41.502]  And I really, again, do not have words to describe how dangerous a situation it is to shoot down a Russian aircraft that our media acts like we're in a coalition with against ISIS because Russia forced our government to at least act like it was fighting ISIS by embarrassing Turkey, the United States, and others.
[00:34:43.502 --> 00:34:44.803]  And so, that's what's happening here.
[00:34:48.171 --> 00:35:09.727]  And as I said, they think we're so dumb, they think we're so ignorant, they think we're so mindless that they can even have videos with the jihadis blowing up the rescue helicopter inside Syria where they left the dead bodies of the pilot and bomber navigator who parachuted down but were shot.
[00:35:12.489 --> 00:35:13.290]  Another war crime.
[00:35:18.547 --> 00:35:25.330]  And it just puts a cherry on top how evil the people are that control our governments and how wicked they are.
[00:35:29.791 --> 00:35:37.154]  But the good news is our military is not ignorant about the players and is not ignorant about what's happening.
[00:35:37.455 --> 00:35:45.778]  From the highest level officers right down to the enlisted people, the military has been on fire for at least three years.
[00:35:48.863 --> 00:35:56.593]  Over the fact that we've been training and aiding actual, bannered, flagged, Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra, now ISIS forces.
[00:35:57.694 --> 00:36:07.146]  And the whole ISIS thing was a desperate gambit to confuse the military and change the narrative off of the fact that our government was quarterbacking operations with Al-Qaeda.
[00:36:11.363 --> 00:36:12.824]  And I told you about the whistleblowers.
[00:36:12.884 --> 00:36:14.825]  I told you about the military officers that were upset.
[00:36:14.845 --> 00:36:16.846]  And then you saw them start going public.
[00:36:17.227 --> 00:36:18.467]  You saw them speaking out.
[00:36:19.348 --> 00:36:23.390]  You saw enlisted, non-commissioned, commissioned officers.
[00:36:24.631 --> 00:36:28.093]  And then you saw the former head of defense intelligence resign three months ago.
[00:36:28.714 --> 00:36:35.318]  He resigned like six months ago, but two or three months ago, he went public and said, no, we were ordered to back Al Qaeda, ISIS.
[00:36:37.919 --> 00:36:38.720]  This is all official.
[00:36:43.757 --> 00:36:55.420]  And that's the equivalent of someone coming out and, you know, blowing the whistle on Bill Clinton selling missile secrets to China.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:07.803]  I mean, it's a red-handed statement, and it just comes out in the news, the reporter interviewing the general just kind of changes the subject away from it, but that's what's going on.
[00:37:11.043 --> 00:37:13.044]  And it's over the top on so many
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:15.560]  Points!
[00:37:18.542 --> 00:37:29.187]  What type of elite would actually want to turn these countries from Libya to Syria over to Wahhabis out of Saudi Arabia?
[00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:34.430]  Well, Saudi Arabia lobbies and has our government bought and paid for when it comes to the Middle East.
[00:37:38.492 --> 00:37:44.115]  In fact, here is the general, the former head of Defense Intelligence on national television talking about it.
[00:37:44.135 --> 00:37:44.375]  Here it is.
[00:37:44.977 --> 00:37:54.565]  For the sake of our viewers, in 2012, your agency was saying, quote, the Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Al-Qaeda in Iraq are the major forces driving the insurgents in Syria.
[00:37:54.945 --> 00:37:56.547]  In 2012, the U.S.
[00:37:56.587 --> 00:37:59.369]  was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups.
[00:37:59.829 --> 00:38:03.692]  Why did you not stop that, if you're worried about the rise of, quote-unquote, Islamic extremism?
[00:38:03.712 --> 00:38:05.494]  I mean, I hate to say it's not my job, but that...
[00:38:05.834 --> 00:38:13.657]  My job was to ensure that the accuracy of our intelligence that was being presented was as good as it could be.
[00:38:14.358 --> 00:38:16.799]  And I will tell you, it goes before 2012.
[00:38:17.019 --> 00:38:24.182]  I mean, when we were in Iraq, and we still had decisions to be made before there was a decision to pull out of Iraq in 2011.
[00:38:25.382 --> 00:38:28.565]  I mean, it was very clear what we were going to face.
[00:38:28.705 --> 00:38:31.247]  Well, I admire your frankness on this subject.
[00:38:31.347 --> 00:38:33.889]  Let me just, before we move on, just to clarify once more.
[00:38:33.909 --> 00:38:40.514]  You are basically saying that even in government at the time, you knew those groups were around, you saw this analysis, and you were arguing against it.
[00:38:40.574 --> 00:38:41.475]  But who wasn't listening?
[00:38:42.552 --> 00:38:44.374]  I think the administration.
[00:38:44.914 --> 00:38:47.597]  The administration turned a blind eye to your analysis.
[00:38:47.617 --> 00:38:49.018]  I don't know if they turned a blind eye.
[00:38:49.058 --> 00:38:50.079]  I think it was a decision.
[00:38:50.099 --> 00:38:51.421]  I think it was a willful decision.
[00:38:51.681 --> 00:38:55.325]  A willful decision to support an insurgency that had Salafists, Al-Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:38:55.345 --> 00:39:00.710]  A willful decision to do what they're doing, which you have to really ask the President
[00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:05.931]  What is it that he actually is doing with the policy that is in place?
[00:39:05.971 --> 00:39:08.412]  Because it is very, very confusing.
[00:39:08.672 --> 00:39:12.092]  I'm sitting here today, Matty, and I can't tell you exactly what that is.
[00:39:12.472 --> 00:39:14.213]  And I've been at this for a long time.
[00:39:14.493 --> 00:39:17.433]  Okay, well let's go back to... Alright, that's General Michael Flynn.
[00:39:18.254 --> 00:39:20.854]  And he adds the caveat at the end that he can't figure it out.
[00:39:20.874 --> 00:39:24.255]  Well, that's because you don't want to murder a couple hundred thousand Christians, General.
[00:39:25.458 --> 00:39:28.260]  So you're not taking the final step.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.360]  You're like, I don't get it.
[00:39:29.401 --> 00:39:30.221]  It doesn't make sense.
[00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:32.562]  Why would you back Al Qaeda to do all this?
[00:39:32.923 --> 00:39:33.743]  What's the plan?
[00:39:34.344 --> 00:39:35.464]  The plan is evil.
[00:39:35.925 --> 00:39:37.045]  The plan is chaos.
[00:39:37.245 --> 00:39:38.346]  The plan is bad.
[00:39:40.167 --> 00:39:41.268]  That's what evil people do.
[00:39:41.508 --> 00:39:42.129]  That's the plan.
[00:39:42.529 --> 00:39:46.391]  It's like asking Jeffrey Dahmer, why'd you grab teenagers off the street and torture them to death?
[00:39:46.431 --> 00:39:47.732]  Because he wanted to.
[00:39:49.213 --> 00:39:53.596]  Or John Wayne Gacy, why'd you pick up young men off the street and torture them to death and bury them in your basement?
[00:39:54.377 --> 00:39:55.217]  Because that's what he did.
[00:39:55.237 --> 00:39:57.818]  When he wasn't dressing up like a clown.
[00:40:00.538 --> 00:40:02.859]  Lenin, why'd you kill 20 million Russians and others?
[00:40:03.379 --> 00:40:04.539]  Because that's what he wanted to do.
[00:40:06.739 --> 00:40:17.121]  They'd send the NKVD in to him, and this is on record, the Russian annals that have been released, and say, okay, we've killed half the town, and no one's resisting as no one ever did, and he'd say, I don't care, more blood, just kill more people.
[00:40:17.822 --> 00:40:19.862]  Rape, murder, I want blood, I want red terror.
[00:40:21.735 --> 00:40:24.737]  And they'd say, but sir, no one's resisting.
[00:40:24.757 --> 00:40:26.798]  And he'd say, more blood!
[00:40:26.818 --> 00:40:31.040]  There's a reason those flags are red.
[00:40:34.062 --> 00:40:50.011]  And again, Bolshevik garbage is a New World Order disease exported like a cancer cell into Russia 98 years ago.
[00:40:57.452 --> 00:40:58.172]  Truly sickening.
[00:41:00.434 --> 00:41:02.055]  And now the same thing's going on here today.
[00:41:02.255 --> 00:41:11.680]  I want to hear from active duty military, not just in this country, but any English-speaking folks from Europe, Russia, I don't care, United States, what is your take on this?
[00:41:12.261 --> 00:41:16.103]  Am I overplaying how this could escalate into a bigger crisis, or am I underplaying it?
[00:41:16.123 --> 00:41:17.204]  Or am I getting it just right?
[00:41:17.304 --> 00:41:17.984]  Or what would you add?
[00:41:18.004 --> 00:41:18.044]  800-259-9231.
[00:41:18.064 --> 00:41:18.104]  800-259-9231.
[00:41:28.112 --> 00:41:29.292]  800-259-9231.
[00:41:29.312 --> 00:41:33.073]  And that's it.
[00:41:33.233 --> 00:41:37.254]  Military or contractors or people in the Middle East that have witnessed this.
[00:41:39.314 --> 00:41:40.514]  Let me explain how it escalates.
[00:41:42.374 --> 00:41:50.896]  You get a key area like Syria that basically controls so much of the entire region because of its placement with all those countries around it.
[00:41:52.596 --> 00:41:56.377]  Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, Turkey,
[00:41:57.688 --> 00:41:58.169]  Iraq.
[00:42:01.332 --> 00:42:02.473]  Saudi Arabia is close.
[00:42:05.716 --> 00:42:13.924]  And they want to break that into different enclaves and then control the energy that comes out of Iraq and that also comes out of the Mediterranean there.
[00:42:14.004 --> 00:42:14.765]  It's a power grab.
[00:42:18.209 --> 00:42:20.231]  And they're going to resettle Syria
[00:42:21.206 --> 00:42:25.548]  With majority Sunnis who were there on a pilgrimage of Jihad.
[00:42:25.588 --> 00:42:27.048]  Their women and children come behind them.
[00:42:27.809 --> 00:42:29.549]  And they move into people's houses with swimming pools.
[00:42:29.969 --> 00:42:33.731]  They move into professors' houses, police officers' houses, farmers' houses.
[00:42:34.111 --> 00:42:38.853]  Hey, this is a nice farm you Syrian Christians have had for 1,800 years.
[00:42:39.293 --> 00:42:40.093]  It's ours now!
[00:42:41.774 --> 00:42:45.635]  And we don't like all these Roman ruins here that are better than the ones in Rome.
[00:42:45.995 --> 00:42:49.637]  We're gonna blow them up, because we're weirdo jerks.
[00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:56.951]  We don't build structures that are there 2,000 years plus later.
[00:42:57.071 --> 00:42:58.151]  We blow them up!
[00:43:00.752 --> 00:43:04.873]  We shoot rescue helicopters on the ground, and our media praises it!
[00:43:10.154 --> 00:43:11.014]  And then it escalates.
[00:43:11.814 --> 00:43:16.295]  And then the Russians will undoubtedly do something now, like bomb
[00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:26.436]  The Russians know that they've got convoys of trucks and tanks, armored vehicles delivering jihadis right through the Turkish border into Syria.
[00:43:28.618 --> 00:43:30.900]  They know that all of that's going on.
[00:43:31.921 --> 00:43:32.941]  That's the battlefront.
[00:43:33.902 --> 00:43:39.207]  And so now, when those Turks step across the border one foot, they're going to get blown up.
[00:43:39.767 --> 00:43:40.247]  And you know what?
[00:43:40.287 --> 00:43:43.670]  Some bombs might actually go across the border now and hit some of those artillery emplacements.
[00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:43.971]  Oh!
[00:43:44.847 --> 00:43:47.828]  Or the guys that are a mile and a half across with tow missiles shooting helicopters.
[00:43:48.649 --> 00:43:51.370]  And then if Turkey wants to come attack, well then the Russians will attack.
[00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:55.712]  And then all of a sudden, you know what the Russians said they'd do in 2008?
[00:43:57.173 --> 00:44:03.076]  In that whole situation that started unfolding in Georgia?
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:21.427]  They rolled medium range mobile missile launchers that had two plus thousand mile ranges in and said we're going to start nuking NATO and US bases and then we're going to start hitting other European bases in one hour.
[00:44:24.828 --> 00:44:28.930]  Because the West attacked South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
[00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:39.633]  The Demilitarized Zone, Russian held since World War II, fought over with Hitler.
[00:44:40.913 --> 00:44:46.635]  They roll in at five in the morning and just attack and just slaughter all the UN and Russian troops.
[00:44:47.075 --> 00:44:54.518]  And then our media goes on air and says, Russia has attacked Georgia.
[00:44:55.758 --> 00:44:58.859]  A lot of Americans thought they meant on the East Coast, in the South.
[00:44:59.319 --> 00:45:01.520]  No, Georgia, south of Russia.
[00:45:02.671 --> 00:45:03.492]  The original Georgia.
[00:45:04.592 --> 00:45:05.493]  Not the one with the peaches.
[00:45:07.054 --> 00:45:08.455]  And I even bought it for about an hour.
[00:45:08.495 --> 00:45:09.116]  I was watching CNN.
[00:45:09.136 --> 00:45:09.776]  I got up in the morning.
[00:45:10.157 --> 00:45:11.237]  Russia attacked Georgia?
[00:45:11.257 --> 00:45:14.340]  I didn't even know, you know, back then that they'd lie that bad.
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:16.501]  I mean, that was just such a bold-faced lie.
[00:45:17.002 --> 00:45:18.743]  And then I started reading foreign press in CNN.
[00:45:18.763 --> 00:45:21.785]  It was like, no, the Russians rolled troops in after the attack.
[00:45:22.506 --> 00:45:28.210]  And then all they're doing is kicking them out of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and saying if they pull back, they won't go further into Georgia.
[00:45:28.931 --> 00:45:32.013]  And then NATO troop planes started landing.
[00:45:35.851 --> 00:45:37.131]  And so Russia rolled missiles in.
[00:45:38.252 --> 00:45:40.352]  And so that's how fast this can happen.
[00:45:40.712 --> 00:45:45.394]  Dick Cheney, who was really the president at the time, he blinked and backed off.
[00:45:51.395 --> 00:45:53.136]  So that's where all this is going.
[00:45:53.156 --> 00:46:04.759]  And look, Caitlyn Jenner won't, even though she's daring, brave, beautiful, incredible, deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:46:06.547 --> 00:46:09.749]  Deserves Miss America Award even though it looks like a snapping turtle with a wig on?
[00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:15.452]  That won't protect us as a bubble of protection.
[00:46:16.533 --> 00:46:22.397]  All the trendies wearing different color socks and things, that won't protect us in a nuclear war.
[00:46:24.698 --> 00:46:31.262]  We just can't live over here in a bubble where our degenerate government and criminals that run it run around murdering everybody.
[00:46:34.209 --> 00:46:36.710]  This will end up coming back on us at some point.
[00:46:37.391 --> 00:46:54.759]  And then to watch Hollande and Merkel and Obama grandstand about security threats and troops on the streets and suspension of free speech in Europe and to protect us from the jihadis that they opened the borders up, they advertised the freebies, they brought them in.
[00:47:02.162 --> 00:47:03.463]  That's pretty amazing, isn't it?
[00:47:05.418 --> 00:47:13.281]  That's pretty darn incredible, isn't it?
[00:47:15.342 --> 00:47:15.902]  You can see it.
[00:47:17.302 --> 00:47:18.823]  They want to bring down civilization.
[00:47:18.863 --> 00:47:20.384]  They want to bring down individualism.
[00:47:20.424 --> 00:47:21.624]  They want to bring down our families.
[00:47:22.024 --> 00:47:22.845]  We are under attack.
[00:47:22.865 --> 00:47:27.086]  We're going to go to break and come back to Brandon, who's a Marine.
[00:47:27.486 --> 00:47:28.307]  John, who's Army.
[00:47:29.547 --> 00:47:30.327]  Randy's Navy.
[00:47:30.888 --> 00:47:32.348]  John in Iowa is also Army.
[00:47:32.368 --> 00:47:34.249]  We'll go to all of you and there's no guests next hour.
[00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:38.931]  And I'll get to all of you.
[00:47:38.951 --> 00:47:39.191]  800-259-9231.
[00:47:39.251 --> 00:47:42.252]  But this really is reckless insanity.
[00:47:43.213 --> 00:47:45.374]  This is how big wars start every time.
[00:47:45.474 --> 00:47:46.374]  It has all the makings.
[00:47:46.454 --> 00:47:47.534]  And it's not just me saying that.
[00:47:47.874 --> 00:47:58.058]  It's every major historian, academic, researcher, from Russia to England to the United States, from Brazil to China, from Japan to South Africa.
[00:47:58.698 --> 00:48:00.519]  The world is lining up for war.
[00:48:02.199 --> 00:48:02.940]  And America
[00:48:04.031 --> 00:48:11.776]  Hadn't been perfect in its history, but it would never, I've studied all our major wars, been involved on the side of not having moral authority.
[00:48:13.097 --> 00:48:16.319]  At least the appearance of the moral authority, at least.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:21.442]  We truly are having our moral authority destroyed right now.
[00:48:21.462 --> 00:48:25.685]  We're having our name destroyed by the more educated world on what's happening.
[00:48:26.085 --> 00:48:27.006]  We're in our little bubble.
[00:48:28.627 --> 00:48:29.928]  And it's a crime against
[00:48:31.693 --> 00:48:32.674]  All our ancestors.
[00:48:32.934 --> 00:48:34.535]  It's truly shameful.
[00:48:34.575 --> 00:48:40.119]  So I'm here to tell you, not in my name, I'm standing up as a real American, as a Christian, as a Texan, as a father.
[00:48:42.381 --> 00:48:45.863]  And saying, I'm not for this and I'm working against it.
[00:48:47.785 --> 00:48:50.687]  I hope you'll spread the word about the broadcast to your friends and family.
[00:48:50.827 --> 00:48:51.508]  I hope that
[00:48:52.452 --> 00:48:59.342]  You'll realize they're trying to shut us down, trying to shut us up, trying to censor us, trying to knock us off stations, trying to block us at every level.
[00:48:59.382 --> 00:49:02.286]  They've been unsuccessful overall, thanks to your prayers and support.
[00:49:03.444 --> 00:49:11.593]  But you need to tell your friends and family about InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, the free audio and video feeds, and InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:49:12.194 --> 00:49:15.377]  You should be sending that link out to everybody you know every day, and I know you are, but keep it up.
[00:49:15.417 --> 00:49:16.118]  It's having an effect.
[00:49:16.658 --> 00:49:18.821]  I'm not going to go into this fight with half measures.
[00:49:19.201 --> 00:49:21.804]  This is a serious, serious fight, and I'm going 110%.
[00:49:21.844 --> 00:49:22.505]  I know you are as well.
[00:49:24.978 --> 00:49:28.561]  We're running Black Friday specials that are actually Black Friday specials.
[00:49:28.601 --> 00:49:30.702]  So many Black Friday specials out there are scams.

[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:52.440]  It's amazing.

[00:50:48.003 --> 00:50:54.128]  We also have the legacy classic store that's super secure and everything has a few little hiccups here and there with slowness when it gets busy.
[00:50:54.408 --> 00:50:55.749]  That's infowarshop.com.

[00:50:59.793 --> 00:51:01.394]  You are the folks that helped build all this.

[00:51:04.577 --> 00:51:05.678]  You are the info war.
[00:51:05.958 --> 00:51:06.919]  You are the resistance.
[00:51:07.159 --> 00:51:08.220]  We'll be back with your phone call.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:08.580]  Stay with us.
[00:51:12.475 --> 00:51:16.676]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[00:51:17.096 --> 00:51:20.837]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[00:51:21.377 --> 00:51:22.638]  We typically do the same thing.
[00:51:22.758 --> 00:51:25.299]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[00:51:25.799 --> 00:51:27.419]  But have you considered heat storage?
[00:51:27.999 --> 00:51:29.800]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:31.880]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[00:51:32.501 --> 00:51:33.881]  How will I keep my family warm?
[00:51:34.141 --> 00:51:36.582]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[00:51:36.622 --> 00:51:40.683]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[00:51:41.508 --> 00:51:42.228]  Another concern?
[00:51:42.629 --> 00:51:46.290]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:48.851]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[00:51:49.191 --> 00:51:52.393]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[00:51:53.173 --> 00:51:55.614]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[00:51:55.975 --> 00:51:59.936]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.

[00:54:16.199 --> 00:54:17.239]  Central, we're here live.
[00:54:17.899 --> 00:54:27.443]  I'm thinking about taking off Thanksgiving and running a really powerful rebroadcast, but I'm here to tell you if war breaks out between Turkey and Russia,
[00:54:28.564 --> 00:54:30.205]  On Escalation, we'll be here.
[00:54:30.225 --> 00:54:35.169]  We'll be filing special reports that are posted to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, you name it.
[00:54:35.549 --> 00:54:38.932]  Paul Watson's hosting on Friday with Rob Doo, but I'm probably going to come in now.
[00:54:39.752 --> 00:54:42.514]  And I'll have them host too, but obviously there's just too much going on.
[00:54:42.995 --> 00:54:47.218]  I want to go to John, Randy, John, John, Brandon, and a bunch of others here in a moment.
[00:54:48.779 --> 00:54:50.620]  Here is what the Turkish president had to say.
[00:54:50.881 --> 00:54:52.222]  I'd play it, but it's in Turkish.
[00:54:53.419 --> 00:54:58.102]  Everybody should know we would make every sacrifice and take every precaution.
[00:54:58.582 --> 00:54:59.543]  That's what Russia is saying.
[00:55:00.423 --> 00:55:07.768]  But here is the quote from the Turkish president.
[00:55:08.548 --> 00:55:16.152]  Everyone should know we would make every sacrifice and take every precaution when our country is surrounded by a circle of flames that you've helped quarterback and run.
[00:55:16.893 --> 00:55:19.995]  And the safety of our borders and the lives of our citizens at risk.
[00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:28.938]  The reaction of the Turkish Armed Forces to jets violating Turkish airspace should be evaluated from this point of view.
[00:55:29.018 --> 00:55:33.063]  We do not have eyes on any particular country's territories.
[00:55:33.103 --> 00:55:35.505]  Everybody should be aware that it's our intentional.
[00:55:36.306 --> 00:55:51.369]  An international right and national duty to do whatever is necessary to take every measure against whoever violates our airspace or land borders, despite the fact that we have issued many warnings and have emphasized our engagement rules during the security summit we held last Sunday.
[00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:58.751]  You mean when your forces have tow missiles blowing up rescue helicopters a mile and a half inside Syria?
[00:55:58.791 --> 00:55:59.371]  Is that what you mean?
[00:55:59.951 --> 00:56:01.272]  Or when you're buying the stolen oil?
[00:56:01.692 --> 00:56:02.532]  You piece of filth!
[00:56:05.171 --> 00:56:09.132]  Ganging up on Sirius, he can murder all the Christians, you anti-Christian maggot!
[00:56:18.274 --> 00:56:20.115]  That's the Turkish Prime Minister, I was saying President.
[00:56:21.575 --> 00:56:24.816]  It's just sickening how dumb they think we are.
[00:56:24.836 --> 00:56:27.356]  Alright, let me see who's been holding longest.
[00:56:28.277 --> 00:56:30.677]  Who's been holding longest, John in Iowa or John in MASH?
[00:56:31.778 --> 00:56:33.278]  Or John in Texas, they're all army.
[00:56:35.339 --> 00:56:49.364]  John and Mass, am I wrong about this, or is it just crazy to watch all these countries ganged up on Syria, Russia's trying to defeat Al-Qaeda, and then now the media is like, how great it is, look the jihadis are blowing up rescue helicopters!
[00:56:49.804 --> 00:56:52.005]  I mean, is this not villainous, or am I wrong?
[00:56:53.846 --> 00:56:55.286]  Well Alex, I'm going to tell you the truth.
[00:56:55.346 --> 00:56:57.587]  I'm calling in for my friend John who's in the service.
[00:56:57.727 --> 00:57:00.568]  He's kind of a victim of the chilling effects.
[00:57:00.968 --> 00:57:02.209]  We had a real long talk.
[00:57:03.354 --> 00:57:15.337]  And he said basically him and his buddies in the military are very aware that technology is now driving the timing for the clash of civilizations.
[00:57:16.077 --> 00:57:23.038]  They feel that if they don't act soon enough that people are going to wake up.
[00:57:23.318 --> 00:57:26.439]  So they've got to use technology now before it turns on them.
[00:57:27.279 --> 00:57:29.680]  And it's kind of a panic mode.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:31.700]  He said it's chaos.
[00:57:32.293 --> 00:57:33.494]  Um, nothing makes sense.
[00:57:34.154 --> 00:57:36.175]  Morale is plummeting in the military.
[00:57:36.215 --> 00:57:39.516]  Him and his buddies absolutely know what's going on.
[00:57:39.556 --> 00:57:43.478]  They go home and they go on the internet and they find out, you know, look at both sides.
[00:57:44.318 --> 00:57:47.659]  And I mean, I got, I asked him, like, how many people are awake?
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.300]  How many people are awake?
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:53.482]  And he's like, all of them, except for the people that came in dumb as a rock.
[00:57:53.882 --> 00:57:57.223]  But everybody that's got any kind of common sense, they get it.
[00:57:57.663 --> 00:57:58.844]  And it's killing morale.
[00:58:00.075 --> 00:58:03.659]  You know, it gives me a little heart because I just don't think they'll be part of it.
[00:58:04.119 --> 00:58:18.273]  But see, you're right, the globalists above them are running out of time because they need to get rid of humans first and have autonomous combat systems, land, sea, and air, and undersea, before they collapse the military with trannies and red high heels as the commandos.
[00:58:18.593 --> 00:58:20.715]  You want to kill morale, it's free to court, that's how you do it.
[00:58:22.917 --> 00:58:30.282]  So they're ahead of schedule ruling the military, but behind schedule rolling out the autonomous systems.
[00:58:31.282 --> 00:58:35.845]  And so it is the end of humanity, the end of chivalry, the end of the soldiers.
[00:58:36.726 --> 00:58:40.088]  And the technocrats now get to play God and send out their robot armies.
[00:58:40.568 --> 00:58:45.931]  But right now they're using proxy armies to attack their enemies, sovereign nations and Christians.
[00:58:46.411 --> 00:58:47.692]  We'll be back with more calls.
[00:58:47.732 --> 00:58:48.152]  Stay there.
[00:58:50.274 --> 00:58:51.575]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:00:15.726 --> 01:00:16.366]  Big Brother.
[01:00:17.026 --> 01:00:18.047]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:18.807 --> 01:00:19.887]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:20.568 --> 01:00:21.368]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.148 --> 01:00:23.028]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.689 --> 01:00:27.330]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:31.931]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:42.469 --> 01:00:48.331]  Alright, I'm taking your phone calls and covering geopolitical and economic news, Black Friday news, special reports in this hour.
[01:00:49.851 --> 01:00:51.092]  But here's the most important point.
[01:00:51.132 --> 01:00:58.954]  It's not just our criminal, occupied government and all these other western governments following this globalist agenda to gang up on sovereign nations and kill every Christian they can find.
[01:01:01.175 --> 01:01:06.956]  It shows us that it's not just about conquering people, it's about actually hurting good people.
[01:01:07.897 --> 01:01:09.137]  And it's a very evil agenda.
[01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:14.883]  We're taking calls from former or current military or people in the region, contractors, you name it.
[01:01:16.045 --> 01:01:22.571]  A Russian aircraft shot down for flying on the border of Turkey.
[01:01:23.512 --> 01:01:27.896]  And then the jihadis sit there with a TOW missile, U.S.
[01:01:27.956 --> 01:01:32.561]  made, and destroy a Russian rescue helicopter a mile and a half away in Syria.
[01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:35.144]  And they admit that themselves.
[01:01:36.005 --> 01:01:40.788]  Russian rescue helicopters shot down by Syrian rebels while searching for pilots a plane down by Turkey.
[01:01:41.269 --> 01:01:44.431]  Well, yeah, they put the bodies out for them and then waited for the helicopter to come.
[01:01:45.912 --> 01:01:48.414]  And again, the plane was shot down over Syria.
[01:01:49.114 --> 01:01:52.197]  It was several miles into Syria.
[01:01:53.817 --> 01:02:01.683]  Let's go to Brandon in FEMA Region 3, formerly a state, then we'll go to John in Texas and Randy in Texas and John in Iowa.
[01:02:01.903 --> 01:02:03.184]  Go ahead, Brandon, thanks for calling.
[01:02:03.224 --> 01:02:04.265]  What's your take on all this?
[01:02:05.746 --> 01:02:06.767]  Good, Alex.
[01:02:07.747 --> 01:02:17.755]  I'm the former Marine who called in last week about the urban warfare drills, and I wanted to talk and tell you that to a lot of my friends that are still in the military,
[01:02:18.188 --> 01:02:20.749]  They're totally freaked out by all this, because the U.S.
[01:02:20.809 --> 01:02:22.570]  military has been stripped down so much.
[01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:31.813]  If we get into a war with Russia, we're not going to have the manpower to be able to fight the Russians, because Obama stripped our military so significantly.
[01:02:31.913 --> 01:02:42.897]  And a lot of people in all branches think it's great that we're going to war with the Russians, and think that because the jihadis are fighting the Russians now, the jihadis somehow
[01:02:43.464 --> 01:02:46.086]  You know, redeemed of all the evil that they're guilty of.
[01:02:46.606 --> 01:02:47.306]  It's insane.
[01:02:47.426 --> 01:02:48.127]  Are you joking?
[01:02:49.467 --> 01:02:50.208]  No, I'm serious!
[01:02:50.328 --> 01:02:56.932]  I have friends... I have friends that I've served with in the Marine Corps who say, you need to shut up about this and stop talking bad about us.
[01:02:56.952 --> 01:03:04.776]  It's like, look, buddy, I'm just talking about the truth, all the injustices of the Iraq War and the Afghan War.
[01:03:04.916 --> 01:03:06.297]  Iraq did nothing to us.
[01:03:06.357 --> 01:03:07.077]  We went in there.
[01:03:07.538 --> 01:03:11.660]  God only knows how many innocent men, women, and children were slaughtered because
[01:03:12.913 --> 01:03:14.333]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:03:14.353 --> 01:03:18.914]  Like, I know Marine Corps officers that say, look, you need to shut up about this.
[01:03:18.934 --> 01:03:24.755]  Because I go to Georgetown and I say, and I talk about quite often, all the evils that the U.S.
[01:03:24.835 --> 01:03:26.956]  Army and Marine Corps have been a part of in Iraq.
[01:03:27.516 --> 01:03:30.776]  And I've gotten calls saying, hey, look, you need to shut up about this, okay?
[01:03:32.257 --> 01:03:40.298]  And I noticed you guys put up the video of my call and people were saying, how do we know this guy's
[01:03:41.336 --> 01:03:48.563]  A former Marine, because I said I was an ex-Marine, and I call myself an ex-Marine because I really regret ever joining the Marine Corps.
[01:03:48.603 --> 01:03:57.851]  Well, sir, when you called in, and we put everything up on YouTube, we don't need you to confirm that they're training in urban warfare to take on Patriots and the Tea Party.
[01:03:58.191 --> 01:03:59.872]  That's in all the declassified documents.
[01:04:00.012 --> 01:04:02.054]  I personally have shot video of it myself.
[01:04:03.175 --> 01:04:03.936]  So it doesn't matter.
[01:04:04.016 --> 01:04:05.457]  People will always deny whatever.
[01:04:05.477 --> 01:04:06.298]  I appreciate your call.
[01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:11.630]  I mean, they'll deny that Seattle is telling folks that they can't have brown bags.
[01:04:13.011 --> 01:04:16.932]  They'll deny that they're trying to ban the term mother or father, even though it's happening.
[01:04:16.972 --> 01:04:20.814]  They'll deny that they've banned dodgeball for 15 years, or tag.
[01:04:21.754 --> 01:04:24.535]  They'll deny that, you know, Obama ever said you could keep your doctor.
[01:04:25.742 --> 01:04:35.285]  I mean, that's just what they do as a default, to not have an intellectual discussion about how they're getting armored MRAPs for the Tea Party and returning veterans.
[01:04:35.946 --> 01:04:48.030]  It's in the documents, it's in the training manuals, and we have the SWAT team commanders from Spokane, Washington to Indianapolis, Indiana, saying it's for the Patriots and the coming war with us.
[01:04:49.110 --> 01:04:51.512]  And I got the Army Times admitting it and all the rest of it.
[01:04:51.552 --> 01:04:56.555]  So, when somebody like you calls in, if I don't think you're telling the truth about something, I'll jump on it.
[01:04:57.256 --> 01:04:58.597]  Because we already know what's going on.
[01:04:59.397 --> 01:05:03.160]  We're going to go to other calls straight ahead on the other side of this break.
[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:06.202]  This is a big deal happening over in Syria.
[01:05:09.622 --> 01:05:10.222]  The D.C.
[01:05:10.262 --> 01:05:14.763]  Police Chief urges citizens to fight back against Paris-style attackers.
[01:05:15.263 --> 01:05:18.564]  Speaking with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Washington, D.C.
[01:05:18.604 --> 01:05:28.526]  Police Chief Kathy Lanier urged residents to do what's necessary to save lives in the event of a terror attack or mass shooting, whether it means run, hide, or fight.
[01:05:28.886 --> 01:05:31.407]  If you're in a position to try to take the gunman out,
[01:05:31.647 --> 01:05:35.669]  It's the best option for saving lives before police can get there, Lanier said.
[01:05:35.889 --> 01:05:48.096]  While acknowledging her latest suggestion was counterintuitive to previous tactics the police have advised, Lanier claimed that taking action may be essential to prevent another massacre like the attack in Paris, which left over 120 people dead.
[01:05:49.557 --> 01:05:51.880]  We always tell people, don't take action.
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.021]  Call 9-1-1.
[01:05:53.141 --> 01:05:55.304]  Don't intervene in the robbery, Lanier said.
[01:05:55.604 --> 01:05:57.486]  We've never told people, take action.
[01:05:57.766 --> 01:05:59.789]  But, it's a different scenario.
[01:06:00.009 --> 01:06:08.358]  Keep up with our latest news and information on InfoWars.com, PrismPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.

[01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:20.854]  My fellow Patreons, anyone that listens to my broadcast for any length of time knows that I can't stand Black Friday, a mindless, idiotic exercise in pure blind consumerism.
[01:07:21.174 --> 01:07:22.295]  I'm for prosperity.
[01:07:22.375 --> 01:07:31.521]  I'm for having good products that make our lives better, but I don't just mindlessly worship the holiday where we're supposedly getting the best deal ever, and statistics show it's one of the worst days to shop.
[01:07:31.741 --> 01:07:39.046]  That's why we are taking the InfoWar to the next level and actually making InfoWarStore.com Black Friday a super deal.

[01:08:13.499 --> 01:08:15.000]  We are on the march.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.801]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:08:18.522 --> 01:08:22.303]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:23.804 --> 01:08:31.788]  If you just joined us in this second hour, it is already, ladies and gentlemen, almost Thanksgiving.
[01:08:31.808 --> 01:08:32.448]  Hard to believe.
[01:08:33.029 --> 01:08:37.571]  It is the 24th day on this Tuesday, worldwide broadcast.
[01:08:37.591 --> 01:08:40.072]  2015 is almost over.
[01:08:43.772 --> 01:08:54.819]  And a Russian fighter bomber was shot down flying close to the border, flying on the border for some of the time, and then crashed about a mile and a half inside Syria.
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:09:00.122]  Then the jihadis from the Turkish side with a TOW missile, U.S.
[01:09:00.182 --> 01:09:03.764]  made on record, blew up the rescue helicopter, another war crime.
[01:09:07.807 --> 01:09:11.429]  The Russians say they're going to have a very serious response to the Turks.
[01:09:13.151 --> 01:09:20.434]  The Turks have bought at least $800 million of stolen Al-Qaeda oil that was stolen from the Syrians.
[01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:26.876]  The Turks have been heavily involved trying to take over Syria the entire five years.
[01:09:27.697 --> 01:09:28.697]  It's truly shameful.
[01:09:29.697 --> 01:09:32.338]  And then our media sits there and acts like we're fighting ISIS.
[01:09:33.179 --> 01:09:35.940]  That's why when Obama was finally forced to bomb a few oil tankers,
[01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:39.271]  They gave him a 45-minute warning.
[01:09:39.331 --> 01:09:41.333]  Our story was on DrugsReport.com yesterday.
[01:09:41.993 --> 01:09:45.416]  So we're taking your phone calls on this subject until the bottom of the hour.
[01:09:45.436 --> 01:09:46.577]  They don't continue with calls.
[01:09:46.597 --> 01:09:49.299]  I'm going to shift gears into some other news we haven't gotten to.
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:51.902]  Some Black Friday reports and more.
[01:09:51.982 --> 01:10:00.189]  But this could very easily escalate into a larger war between NATO and Russia.
[01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:02.270]  And that's mainstream news saying that.
[01:10:02.751 --> 01:10:03.892]  Then I watch Hollande
[01:10:06.072 --> 01:10:23.977]  The President of France, I watched the Chancellor of Germany, Merkel, and others grandstanding about, oh, we have a civil emergency, no demonstrations, no free speech, but the borders stay wide open, and we're protecting you from terrorists, the very people who brought them in.
[01:10:24.577 --> 01:10:29.138]  Truly, sickening, on every front.
[01:10:32.267 --> 01:10:35.468]  And this just shows us who runs our country and who runs Europe.
[01:10:35.488 --> 01:10:37.708]  These are really nasty, bad people.
[01:10:38.588 --> 01:10:54.832]  And our governments are allied with the so-called royal family, a bunch of caravan robbing bandits, who then just run around murdering all over the world.
[01:10:55.552 --> 01:10:56.872]  And then we never really fight them.
[01:10:58.592 --> 01:11:01.873]  We go attack a country like Iraq that was fighting them.
[01:11:04.181 --> 01:11:04.986]  And blame them for 9-11!
[01:11:09.571 --> 01:11:11.031]  So I want to hear from military folks.
[01:11:11.091 --> 01:11:11.992]  I want to hear from pilots.
[01:11:12.032 --> 01:11:13.012]  I want to hear from analysts.
[01:11:13.032 --> 01:11:15.473]  I want to hear from people that have lived in Turkey or Syria.
[01:11:15.493 --> 01:11:16.673]  Where do you think all this is going?
[01:11:16.993 --> 01:11:18.053]  Is it as bad as I'm saying?
[01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:18.613]  I think it is.
[01:11:18.633 --> 01:11:19.794]  You think I'm wrong?
[01:11:20.114 --> 01:11:20.694]  What can you add?
[01:11:20.734 --> 01:11:21.474]  We've got Maverick.
[01:11:21.894 --> 01:11:23.835]  He says he worked on a cultural project in Turkey.
[01:11:24.055 --> 01:11:24.755]  But he just called in.
[01:11:24.775 --> 01:11:25.355]  We'll get to him.
[01:11:25.795 --> 01:11:27.256]  John was Army in Texas.
[01:11:27.276 --> 01:11:27.816]  Wants to comment.
[01:11:27.876 --> 01:11:28.556]  Randy in Texas.
[01:11:28.996 --> 01:11:29.596]  Former Navy.
[01:11:29.956 --> 01:11:30.917]  John and I was Army.
[01:11:31.237 --> 01:11:32.857]  We're going to go to the Johns first.
[01:11:32.877 --> 01:11:34.137]  Then we're going to go to Maverick and Randy.
[01:11:34.898 --> 01:11:35.798]  John in Texas.
[01:11:36.658 --> 01:11:39.299]  This is escalating just as we warned it could.
[01:11:39.399 --> 01:11:43.780]  Now I hope the next phase of escalation doesn't happen.
[01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:46.940]  What do you think Obama and the globalists are thinking right now?
[01:11:48.401 --> 01:11:53.622]  Well, Alex, what I'm afraid is going to happen over this is we're going to have a major war breakout.
[01:11:54.222 --> 01:11:56.462]  They're going to say, well, gee, we can't go nuclear.
[01:11:56.482 --> 01:11:57.642]  It'll destroy the whole world.
[01:11:58.183 --> 01:12:01.523]  Let's fight this conventionally like we did in Korea and Vietnam.
[01:12:01.903 --> 01:12:04.444]  We'll have a war that drags on for how many years?
[01:12:05.723 --> 01:12:10.325]  And you remember in World War I and World War II, basically we were in a dictatorship here.
[01:12:10.365 --> 01:12:14.406]  We had food rationing, travel restrictions, gas rationing.
[01:12:14.426 --> 01:12:16.647]  Anybody who criticized the war was thrown into jail.
[01:12:16.667 --> 01:12:20.769]  That's what I'm afraid is going to happen out of this.
[01:12:20.849 --> 01:12:21.249]  You're right.
[01:12:21.769 --> 01:12:23.430]  Sir, you said it.
[01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:24.470]  I said it.
[01:12:25.583 --> 01:12:26.164]  This is it.
[01:12:26.724 --> 01:12:28.927]  And what you just said is the answer to everything.
[01:12:29.508 --> 01:12:33.953]  They have already declared civil emergency in Germany and France and in Belgium.
[01:12:34.534 --> 01:12:35.795]  Other countries are following suit.
[01:12:36.176 --> 01:12:38.498]  They're restricting nighttime curfews.
[01:12:39.259 --> 01:12:40.120]  Papers, please.
[01:12:40.801 --> 01:12:41.842]  No demonstrations.
[01:12:43.393 --> 01:12:45.075]  They have an emergency edict in place.
[01:12:45.516 --> 01:12:51.202]  Their socialist president is using this to seize control because people can't say 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:12:51.663 --> 01:12:53.825]  They're saying it says whatever the tyrant says.
[01:12:54.266 --> 01:12:57.049]  Hollande and others are the ones that offered the freebies.
[01:12:57.349 --> 01:12:58.551]  They brought in the radicals.
[01:12:58.811 --> 01:13:00.033]  They allowed them to attack.
[01:13:01.994 --> 01:13:15.501]  And they are now doing this to bring in a wartime atmosphere where they, the actual culprits, the actual mafia dons of our present crisis, are now our saviors.
[01:13:15.722 --> 01:13:16.422]  Please continue.
[01:13:18.463 --> 01:13:20.064]  Well, I think that's what's going to happen.
[01:13:20.084 --> 01:13:23.086]  I mean, if we have a major war, how long is it going to drag on for?
[01:13:23.146 --> 01:13:26.027]  How long did World War I, World War II drag on for?
[01:13:26.087 --> 01:13:27.468]  And they had major, huge war.
[01:13:27.847 --> 01:13:32.054]  I mean, they had the Battle of Verdun where billions were killed and all these major battles.
[01:13:32.134 --> 01:13:41.270]  I mean, are we prepared to take the casualties like they had in World War I and II where, you know, maybe every one battle, a hundred thousand people die in one battle, you know?
[01:13:42.762 --> 01:13:50.306]  Well, absolutely, and I made the comment, even though both my grandfathers were in World War II, that the United States basically supplied munitions and weapons to Russia.
[01:13:51.126 --> 01:14:01.371]  We lost 400, 500,000 people in World War II, the Brits over 100,000, but the Russians lost 20 plus, 20, 21 million.
[01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:04.252]  The Germans lost 20 plus million people.
[01:14:05.353 --> 01:14:07.254]  Germany was only like 70 million people.
[01:14:09.090 --> 01:14:12.571]  And when they were done, they were 50 million or less.
[01:14:13.351 --> 01:14:14.672]  I mean, this isn't a game.
[01:14:14.712 --> 01:14:15.492]  It isn't a joke.
[01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:17.812]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:14:18.593 --> 01:14:22.614]  The Russians fought really about 90% of World War II.
[01:14:23.814 --> 01:14:27.315]  And they lost a large portion of their population.
[01:14:29.316 --> 01:14:34.157]  And now, you could say Stalin was just as bad as Hitler, in my view, historically.
[01:14:35.357 --> 01:14:37.578]  There really is no lesser of two evils, but now Russia
[01:14:40.162 --> 01:14:41.222]  He's not the bad guy.
[01:14:41.262 --> 01:14:44.223]  You have to look at the West and say, we really are the villains this time.
[01:14:44.903 --> 01:14:58.087]  And believe me, the villains running our countries are setting up a police state and saying, from the rooftops, it's for, quote, returning veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, Christians.
[01:14:59.408 --> 01:15:06.030]  Because when they do all this wartime stuff and start arresting people, they know vets are some of the only groups that might fight back.
[01:15:06.909 --> 01:15:18.184]  And so yes, they want to have a socialist, collectivist uprising to overthrow the local cities, to put their local commissariats in control, and then dictate
[01:15:21.374 --> 01:15:27.136]  Through their apparatchiks, the commissar system of political persecution.
[01:15:27.236 --> 01:15:32.158]  I mean, we are going to have a basically a Soviet-style occupation run on us.
[01:15:32.478 --> 01:15:34.079]  And that's come out in the FBI files.
[01:15:34.339 --> 01:15:35.539]  That's what we know from the Weathermen.
[01:15:35.799 --> 01:15:37.900]  That's really the plan in the new Army manuals.
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:39.801]  I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's all true.
[01:15:40.461 --> 01:15:43.602]  They say re-education camp for the patriots.
[01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:47.064]  And it won't matter we're the good guys.
[01:15:47.084 --> 01:15:49.004]  It won't matter we're the hard-working Americans.
[01:15:49.224 --> 01:15:50.345]  That's why they hate us.
[01:15:52.955 --> 01:16:06.054]  It's the socialists, it's the collectivists, all run by the George Soros types, who are, you know, telling Matt Drudge to the grapevine through the Supreme Court Justice that, no, 2016, we're coming after all of you.
[01:16:07.352 --> 01:16:11.874]  And so Matt Drudge is hopping up and down in the studio going, we're running out of time!
[01:16:11.894 --> 01:16:14.014]  We're on a limited time schedule here.
[01:16:14.755 --> 01:16:17.556]  Can we find that clip of the clips Matt Drudge talks about?
[01:16:17.576 --> 01:16:18.356]  We're running out of time.
[01:16:18.396 --> 01:16:22.998]  Matt Drudge talks about they're coming after free press, the Supreme Court, Justice comment.
[01:16:23.018 --> 01:16:25.038]  I mean, it was in like a hundred newspapers plus.
[01:16:25.679 --> 01:16:26.459]  It shouldn't be hard to find.
[01:16:27.919 --> 01:16:33.422]  See, people always think, oh, World War II happened to them, or World War I happened to them, or Korea happened to them, or oh, this or that.
[01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:38.684]  This is, you have front row seats to world government takeover, people.
[01:16:39.805 --> 01:16:43.106]  And it's not a world government that wants to just have prosperity and go to Mars.
[01:16:44.007 --> 01:16:46.208]  It's world government that wants to kill you.
[01:16:46.228 --> 01:16:51.150]  You understand?
[01:16:51.170 --> 01:16:53.891]  Now, there's the headline, Matt Drudge warns of the end of the internet.
[01:16:53.911 --> 01:16:55.012]  We've got to get that clip and play it.
[01:16:55.731 --> 01:16:56.711]  I mean, do you get it?
[01:16:56.952 --> 01:17:02.394]  Do you think the recluse Matt Drudge just shows up here because he wants to play tiddlywinks with us?
[01:17:02.414 --> 01:17:09.817]  He's not really a recluse, he's all over the place, but he's smart enough to keep where he's at and what he's doing private.
[01:17:11.537 --> 01:17:15.419]  I don't want to say he was wearing a disguise when he was here, but he's a smart guy.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.101]  This isn't a game, people.
[01:17:21.527 --> 01:17:22.649]  They're coming for your kids.
[01:17:22.689 --> 01:17:23.810]  They're coming for your guns.
[01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:26.314]  He promised to get the better clingers, didn't he?
[01:17:26.915 --> 01:17:29.238]  They want to break us.
[01:17:29.839 --> 01:17:30.480]  Thank you, John.
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:30.941]  Great points.
[01:17:30.961 --> 01:17:32.943]  I'm going to play the drudge clip, but you just said it all.
[01:17:32.964 --> 01:17:34.546]  We're going to go to break and come back with...
[01:17:35.697 --> 01:17:36.798]  John in Iowa and then others.
[01:17:37.498 --> 01:17:39.960]  Here is Matt Drudge, warning of the fact that time's running out.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  We have limited time.
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:42.021]  You understand, folks?
[01:17:42.421 --> 01:17:43.262]  Limited time.
[01:17:43.322 --> 01:17:44.522]  We can beat these people.
[01:17:45.143 --> 01:17:47.424]  But we've got to stand up and say, you're crooks.
[01:17:47.684 --> 01:17:48.285]  You're evil.
[01:17:48.525 --> 01:17:49.225]  You're scum.
[01:17:50.086 --> 01:17:54.108]  Their rhetoric is so over the top, we have to rise to the level of what they are.
[01:17:56.410 --> 01:17:59.332]  If you don't admit to yourselves how much trouble we're in, it's over!
[01:18:00.632 --> 01:18:01.273]  Let's go to the clip.
[01:18:02.051 --> 01:18:05.552]  I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[01:18:05.572 --> 01:18:08.133]  I said, man, it's over for you.
[01:18:08.473 --> 01:18:10.674]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[01:18:10.954 --> 01:18:11.534]  You're out of there.
[01:18:11.554 --> 01:18:14.495]  They're going to make it so headlines, you can't even use headlines.
[01:18:15.495 --> 01:18:23.258]  To have a Supreme Court justice say that to my face, that it's over, they've got the votes, which means time is limited.
[01:18:23.598 --> 01:18:24.919]  Time is not forever.
[01:18:25.759 --> 01:18:28.880]  How many more moons and sunrises will you see in your life?
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:30.701]  Uh, rise and fall.
[01:18:30.921 --> 01:18:31.881]  There's not that many.
[01:18:32.001 --> 01:18:33.522]  It's a small amount.
[01:18:34.002 --> 01:18:39.585]  So for people to be saying with this attitude, oh, I'll get on with my life and my greatness sometime.
[01:18:39.685 --> 01:18:39.885]  No.
[01:18:40.125 --> 01:18:40.985]  No, you can't.
[01:18:41.085 --> 01:18:42.986]  We're being enslaved now, and that's it.
[01:18:43.146 --> 01:18:48.089]  Under the TPP, they admit you can't put a headline to the New York Times.
[01:18:48.369 --> 01:18:50.370]  You're sending massive traffic to them.
[01:18:50.690 --> 01:18:53.151]  They're claiming you're taking their words.
[01:18:53.411 --> 01:18:54.212]  This is insane.
[01:18:54.272 --> 01:18:58.033]  And you had the Justice Stephen Breyer said we need to look at a global law now.
[01:18:58.053 --> 01:18:59.034]  Remember just recently?
[01:19:00.314 --> 01:19:02.775]  So they're getting ready for these decisions to come.
[01:19:02.795 --> 01:19:04.455]  You thought Obamacare was shocking.
[01:19:04.815 --> 01:19:06.616]  You thought some of these other decisions were shocking.
[01:19:06.676 --> 01:19:17.458]  Wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board.
[01:19:19.798 --> 01:19:23.379]  The full 45 minute interview, we're going to re-air that I think on Thanksgiving.
[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:27.820]  But it's a very, very important interview.
[01:19:29.264 --> 01:19:32.171]  And people just need to understand, time is limited.
[01:19:33.936 --> 01:19:34.596]  Time is limited.
[01:19:35.177 --> 01:19:37.258]  These people want to put their foot on our necks.
[01:19:37.298 --> 01:19:38.799]  They want to dominate us.
[01:19:38.859 --> 01:19:41.561]  They want to break us because we are strong.
[01:19:41.801 --> 01:19:42.842]  Because we are smart.
[01:19:43.102 --> 01:19:44.323]  Because we are productive.
[01:19:44.583 --> 01:19:46.044]  They want to enslave us.
[01:19:47.044 --> 01:19:51.807]  It's not enough that the crooks in government and the crooks in these big corporations took over fraudulently.
[01:19:52.428 --> 01:19:53.869]  They want to break us.
[01:19:54.729 --> 01:20:00.453]  Just like they want to blow up every old Roman temple and murder every Christian they can find.
[01:20:00.533 --> 01:20:01.494]  They hate us.
[01:20:02.054 --> 01:20:03.115]  They're coming for us.
[01:20:03.796 --> 01:20:04.761]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:20:09.818 --> 01:20:13.800]  With a new year coming, it's time for a new way to look at weapon storage.
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:17.202]  Safes can't be accessed quickly and racks are unsafe for children.
[01:20:17.322 --> 01:20:19.823]  Covert Cabinets are the next level in home defense.
[01:20:19.903 --> 01:20:25.285]  They fit seamlessly into any home's decor and they provide quick access to firearms while keeping them uniquely hidden.
[01:20:25.345 --> 01:20:27.907]  Covert Cabinets, the ideal hidden storage solution.
[01:20:27.967 --> 01:20:34.910]  Custom made in the USA, Covert Cabinets are an elegant and practical alternative to the bulky and obvious storage systems of the past.
[01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:37.111]  Find out more at CovertCabinets.com.
[01:20:37.151 --> 01:20:38.412]  That's CovertCabinets.com.
[01:20:39.741 --> 01:20:41.583]  Who's among the worst at keeping your data private?
[01:20:41.703 --> 01:20:45.188]  The Electronic Frontier Foundation Privacy Report says it's AT&T.
[01:20:45.448 --> 01:20:50.274]  AT&T customers need to know this when calling the Alex Jones 24-7 listen line at 1-605-562-9000.
[01:20:50.334 --> 01:20:52.697]  Big Brother is listening.
[01:20:52.957 --> 01:20:53.378]  No apps.
[01:20:53.498 --> 01:20:53.938]  No data.
[01:20:54.058 --> 01:20:54.819]  No internet needed.
[01:20:54.939 --> 01:20:56.922]  And no extra cost if you have unlimited minutes.
[01:20:57.102 --> 01:21:01.345]  Call the Alex Jones 24-7 Listen Line on any phone, but please don't use AT&T.
[01:21:01.445 --> 01:21:04.146]  For everyone else, bookmark Alex Jones Listen Line number today.
[01:21:04.166 --> 01:21:05.187]  1-605-562-9000.
[01:21:06.128 --> 01:21:08.489]  That's 1-605-562-9000.
[01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:20.977]  My fellow Patreons, anyone that listens to my broadcast for any length of time knows that I can't stand Black Friday, a mindless, idiotic exercise in pure blind consumerism.
[01:21:21.337 --> 01:21:22.458]  I'm for prosperity.
[01:21:22.538 --> 01:21:31.665]  I'm for having good products that make our lives better, but I don't just mindlessly worship the holiday where we're supposedly getting the best deal ever, and statistics show it's one of the worst days to shop.

[01:22:36.529 --> 01:22:39.310]  I recently went from a desk job to a manual labor job.

[01:24:27.165 --> 01:24:29.748]  They used to grow corn in Kansas.
[01:24:30.289 --> 01:24:35.956]  Now they grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
[01:24:36.817 --> 01:24:39.760]  I can see a day coming when even your home garden will be against the law.
[01:24:41.783 --> 01:24:43.184]  Bob Dylan wrote that back in the 80s.
[01:24:43.224 --> 01:24:44.566]  Now that's come true in many U.S.
[01:24:44.606 --> 01:24:44.906]  cities.
[01:24:48.587 --> 01:24:49.908]  Shun down on the union.
[01:24:50.388 --> 01:24:53.550]  Democracy don't rule the world.
[01:24:53.570 --> 01:24:55.171]  You better get that through your head.
[01:24:55.711 --> 01:24:58.553]  This world is ruled by violence.
[01:24:58.833 --> 01:25:02.956]  Democracy don't rule the world.
[01:25:03.016 --> 01:25:06.198]  You better get that through your head.
[01:25:06.238 --> 01:25:09.159]  This world is ruled by violence.
[01:25:09.279 --> 01:25:12.041]  But I guess that's better left unsaid.
[01:25:16.593 --> 01:25:20.255]  Bob Dylan said you gotta serve somebody, and then he said you gotta sell out to the devil.
[01:25:21.956 --> 01:25:23.877]  Then he said he sold out to the god of this world.
[01:25:27.019 --> 01:25:30.061]  From Broadway to the Milky Way, that's a lot of real estate indeed.
[01:25:30.942 --> 01:25:33.083]  And a man's gonna do what a man's gotta do.
[01:25:35.844 --> 01:25:37.325]  Was I just demonizing Bob Dylan?
[01:25:37.405 --> 01:25:39.527]  No, I think that's pretty hardcore, the stuff he said.
[01:25:40.807 --> 01:25:41.848]  Pretty twisted, too.
[01:25:43.369 --> 01:25:45.030]  Or was he just trying to get people thinking?
[01:25:47.625 --> 01:25:51.328]  It'd be easy to write those lyrics today, but pretty hard back in, I think, 1982.
[01:25:54.031 --> 01:25:55.632]  Yeah, we used to grow corn in Kansas.
[01:25:57.414 --> 01:25:59.375]  Now we grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
[01:26:01.737 --> 01:26:03.899]  I want to go back to your phone calls right into the next segment.
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:11.126]  We just joined this Russian rescue helicopter after they shot down the fighter bomber flying along the border of Turkey.
[01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:14.329]  They then blow up with a US-made anti-tank missile.
[01:26:15.151 --> 01:26:21.855]  The helicopter on the ground, they put the dead bodies out for him to land and blew up the rescue helicopter.
[01:26:24.217 --> 01:26:29.640]  And that's the type of people we back, the jihadis that literally murder every Christian they can get their hands on.
[01:26:31.521 --> 01:26:36.645]  With the suspension of reality going on, then it's not a news issue that, why are we backing these people?
[01:26:37.441 --> 01:26:38.561]  Why are our borders open?
[01:26:38.902 --> 01:26:39.882]  Why are we bringing them here?
[01:26:39.942 --> 01:26:43.023]  These are the so-called Syrian refugees that Turkey lets in.
[01:26:43.403 --> 01:26:44.644]  They don't let Christians in.
[01:26:44.684 --> 01:26:50.306]  That's why you'll have thousands of jihadis, thousands of wahhabis, and they'll have one Christian.
[01:26:50.326 --> 01:26:50.986]  That was the headline.
[01:26:51.346 --> 01:26:54.728]  Two thousand something Muslims, one Christian.
[01:26:56.328 --> 01:26:58.309]  And then Obama gets up on the news and says,
[01:27:00.543 --> 01:27:02.124]  Well, we can't just take Christians.
[01:27:02.164 --> 01:27:03.765]  That's not what this is about, refugees, really.
[01:27:04.045 --> 01:27:06.406]  You take who's being persecuted, jackass.
[01:27:06.786 --> 01:27:08.407]  That's what political asylum is.
[01:27:09.528 --> 01:27:10.568]  And you know that full well.
[01:27:11.829 --> 01:27:13.650]  It takes real pleasure not letting the Christians in.
[01:27:13.670 --> 01:27:18.872]  If there isn't a Christian Obama ever found, you didn't want to slit their throat and cut their head off, it'd be good.
[01:27:19.112 --> 01:27:19.753]  I'm serious.
[01:27:20.333 --> 01:27:20.853]  I've seen it.
[01:27:20.873 --> 01:27:22.174]  They hate Christians.
[01:27:23.834 --> 01:27:24.955]  He'll get those bitter clingers.
[01:27:25.555 --> 01:27:26.796]  He'll send in his jihadis.
[01:27:27.296 --> 01:27:30.718]  He'll cut daddy's head off, rape mama and the girls before they kill him.
[01:27:31.998 --> 01:27:34.560]  And he'll get a peace prize and Gloria Steinem will drop by.
[01:27:36.801 --> 01:27:39.282]  John in Iowa, then I'm going to go to break, go to Randy and everybody else.
[01:27:39.302 --> 01:27:40.122]  I'm going to try to go quicker now.
[01:27:40.142 --> 01:27:40.823]  I want to go to Maverick.
[01:27:40.863 --> 01:27:41.823]  Maverick, don't hang up.
[01:27:41.843 --> 01:27:42.584]  I want to hear from you.
[01:27:42.984 --> 01:27:44.104]  John, I'm going in order here.
[01:27:44.144 --> 01:27:44.485]  Go ahead.
[01:27:44.505 --> 01:27:45.025]  Next Maverick.
[01:27:45.956 --> 01:27:46.877]  Hey there, Alex.
[01:27:46.897 --> 01:27:51.139]  You know, everything that's going on currently is absolutely unbelievable.
[01:27:51.939 --> 01:28:05.146]  And what I foresee happening with this situation in Turkey is, you know, what's going to happen with this is this is a furtherance to get Russia into a full-out, full-fledged, full-blown war with the NATO alliances.
[01:28:06.025 --> 01:28:16.229]  And if this actually happens, what I foresee happening is Russia is going to be fighting a two-front fight, not only in the Middle East, but over on the western border of Russia itself and Ukraine.
[01:28:16.349 --> 01:28:20.090]  So they're already fighting a two-proxy war right now, you're saying it's going to escalate?
[01:28:21.207 --> 01:28:21.707]  Absolutely.
[01:28:21.747 --> 01:28:27.430]  Without a doubt, it's going to escalate to the point of thermal nuclear war or thermal barrack nuclear war.
[01:28:28.110 --> 01:28:31.631]  And, you know, I mean, this is just absolutely, I mean, frightening, to say the least.
[01:28:32.011 --> 01:28:37.554]  I mean, you know, you know as well as I do, everybody here in the United States does not want to be involved in any war.
[01:28:37.674 --> 01:28:38.674]  We don't want to go fight.
[01:28:38.714 --> 01:28:40.695]  We don't want to have anything to do with this.
[01:28:41.235 --> 01:28:46.340]  But now they are literally pushing us and pushing and pushing and pushing until we are going to be involved.
[01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:48.362]  And, you know, I don't know.
[01:28:48.382 --> 01:28:50.223]  I mean, it is out of control.
[01:28:50.243 --> 01:28:58.291]  You know, I've got a radio show I do every Sunday on my own program and I talk about this and I called this three weeks, three months ago, just as much as you did.
[01:28:58.311 --> 01:29:02.775]  I said, you know, what's going to happen is there's going to be a situation where
[01:29:03.639 --> 01:29:05.100]  Soldiers on the ground get bombed.
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:11.082]  Like, let's say how they were wanting to put our soldiers there to be body shields for the sissies of the desert, the ISIS.
[01:29:12.182 --> 01:29:15.443]  And, you know, it was either going to be something like that or a jet's going to be downed.
[01:29:15.843 --> 01:29:24.326]  Well, now a jet has been downed and this is the match being thrown into the tinderbox to literally... And they blew up the Russian jetliner to stir them up.
[01:29:25.006 --> 01:29:26.607]  I mean, Russia's not stupid.
[01:29:26.627 --> 01:29:27.347]  They play chess.
[01:29:27.387 --> 01:29:30.268]  They know they're trying to sucker them into a larger war.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:31.741]  Stay there.
[01:29:31.762 --> 01:29:32.725]  I want to come back to you.
[01:29:33.187 --> 01:29:34.030]  John's Army.
[01:29:34.050 --> 01:29:35.154]  I want to hear about your radio show.
[01:29:35.174 --> 01:29:36.037]  We'll just plug that.
[01:29:37.411 --> 01:29:38.872]  Again, folks, I'm not about competition.
[01:29:39.012 --> 01:29:42.214]  I want... I want a hundred people better than I am out there.
[01:29:42.234 --> 01:29:43.215]  I'm looking for them, believe me.
[01:29:43.255 --> 01:29:45.156]  If I find them, I'm gonna try to hire them and they can take over.
[01:29:45.176 --> 01:29:47.257]  This is a fight, folks.
[01:29:47.277 --> 01:29:47.938]  This is a war.
[01:29:47.998 --> 01:29:50.159]  We need soldiers in the fight, people that get it.
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:58.925]  And it's surreal, though, to watch everybody else talking about Thanksgiving, just wandering around, talking about Battlefront on PlayStation, when the real Battlefront is happening.
[01:29:59.125 --> 01:30:00.045]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.506 --> 01:30:02.127]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.047 --> 01:30:05.729]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.642 --> 01:30:18.924]  Global warming advocates are now blaming luxury condominiums for man-made climate change, despite the record-breaking snowfall which recently pounded the northern U.S.
[01:30:19.124 --> 01:30:26.566]  The Climate Words for All Coalition released a report claiming that luxury apartment buildings are the largest climate change offenders in New York City.
[01:30:26.726 --> 01:30:37.949]  These are New York City's largest buildings, over 50,000 square feet in size, which primarily consist of a mixture of luxury apartments, commercial buildings, and multifamily housing developments, the report stated.
[01:30:38.049 --> 01:30:42.633]  The report was released just as New York was being pounded by heavy snowstorms.
[01:30:42.993 --> 01:30:48.318]  Global warming advocates, however, will attempt to blame this record snowfall on man-made climate change.
[01:30:48.598 --> 01:30:54.283]  Even though a few years ago, they were predicting that the Earth's ice caps would have dramatically melted by now.
[01:30:54.563 --> 01:31:00.068]  But they really want you to live in a tiny apartment so they can cram more people into your neighborhood and tax the area.
[01:31:00.228 --> 01:31:02.570]  Keep up with our latest news and information.
[01:31:02.930 --> 01:31:08.626]  On InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.TV, and the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[01:31:09.372 --> 01:31:12.594]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:12.895 --> 01:31:20.900]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:26.164]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:31:26.564 --> 01:31:28.846]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:31:29.086 --> 01:31:30.887]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:31:39.309 --> 01:31:40.230]  BrainForce is here.
[01:31:40.411 --> 01:31:42.533]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:31:42.613 --> 01:31:47.359]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:50.784]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:31:50.904 --> 01:31:54.088]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:31:54.388 --> 01:31:56.091]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:31:56.391 --> 01:31:58.253]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:31:58.454 --> 01:32:00.376]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:32:00.456 --> 01:32:05.543]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:05.563 --> 01:32:07.145]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:32:13.092 --> 01:32:19.195]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:32:19.375 --> 01:32:26.378]  That's why, for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:32:26.678 --> 01:32:35.522]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[01:32:35.802 --> 01:32:37.423]  Secret 12 is a Bionary.
[01:32:37.483 --> 01:32:38.183]  We're good to go.
[01:33:27.352 --> 01:33:31.794]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:33:32.394 --> 01:33:33.835]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.178 --> 01:33:47.425]  This is not... This goes beyond the framework of the regular fight against terrorism.
[01:33:47.845 --> 01:33:55.951]  Certainly our military men are fighting terrorism, sacrificing their own lives.
[01:33:56.693 --> 01:34:01.155]  But today's loss is related with the stab in our back by the Associates of Terrorism.
[01:34:17.825 --> 01:34:21.706]  I cannot find another wording to what happened today.
[01:34:23.006 --> 01:34:28.188]  He goes on to say Turkey is getting the oil that ISIS is stealing.
[01:34:28.228 --> 01:34:30.169]  That's on record and they're aiding and abetting terrorists.
[01:34:31.909 --> 01:34:36.591]  So the good news is, Putin and Russia is so high profile, it's all coming out now.
[01:34:36.951 --> 01:34:40.672]  Former head of Defense Intelligence, as we played last hour, said, no, we're ordered to aid Al Qaeda.
[01:34:40.912 --> 01:34:41.712]  This is all on purpose.
[01:34:42.052 --> 01:34:46.314]  Joss Earnest, back in October, said that Russia's playing checkers, not chess.
[01:34:46.414 --> 01:34:58.778]  No, what we're doing is losing our moral authority and doing really evil war crimes against Muslim minorities and Christians, against a sovereign country that has a defense treaty with Russia that we attacked.
[01:34:59.909 --> 01:35:07.934]  And that John McCain has been photographed with the leaders of ISIS and Al-Qaeda two years ago hanging out inside Syria.
[01:35:10.256 --> 01:35:10.896]  It's incredible.
[01:35:12.898 --> 01:35:14.599]  And it shows the arrogance of these people.
[01:35:14.639 --> 01:35:18.081]  In fact, let's play a clip of Josh Earnest making that statement.
[01:35:18.101 --> 01:35:18.281]  No, no.
[01:35:18.682 --> 01:35:20.843]  What we're doing is being sucked into pure evil.
[01:35:21.624 --> 01:35:24.446]  What Russia is doing is the moral right obligation.
[01:35:24.706 --> 01:35:27.648]  Defending a country under attack by murderous scum.
[01:35:29.133 --> 01:35:37.782]  On the military-to-military talks, I would not rule out that there are follow-ups relatively soon to those initial conversations that took place last week.
[01:35:39.344 --> 01:35:42.747]  But I think there is one premise of your question that I would disagree with.
[01:35:44.494 --> 01:35:47.456]  I don't think President Putin is playing chess, he's playing checkers.
[01:35:48.796 --> 01:35:58.562]  And I say that because he's making a series of tactical decisions that are leading to a starkly negative strategic conclusion.
[01:35:59.102 --> 01:36:00.123]  This is just moral authority garbage.
[01:36:04.065 --> 01:36:15.033]  Where we're the West, we're allowed to do whatever we want, and so we'll just do horribly amoral things and side with horrible people, and because we're gonna win, that makes it morally okay.
[01:36:15.253 --> 01:36:16.474]  Well, you're not going to win.
[01:36:17.981 --> 01:36:30.267]  And look, I don't romanticize the military, but at least historically, kings had to go out and fight, royal families sent their kids to the front lines, because the troops wouldn't fight if you didn't do that, if you didn't have skin in the game.
[01:36:30.928 --> 01:36:39.572]  And the last 50 years or so, we've gone from every president we had basically being a military veteran, except for Abraham Lincoln maybe, and a few others,
[01:36:42.372 --> 01:36:47.675]  To people that have no conception of history, even, or what happens.
[01:36:48.716 --> 01:36:56.260]  And so, it is our military, as corrupt as it is, as bad as it is, that's actually been saying, we shouldn't be doing this.
[01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:59.602]  This isn't good to back Al Qaeda.
[01:37:00.542 --> 01:37:05.525]  And that's why we know about this, is because they've been speaking about it, and I've been speaking about it as well, obviously.
[01:37:06.874 --> 01:37:15.737]  That's why we're such big enemies there at the White House and why they constantly daily lie about us now and just say things on news, on comedy shows, in movies.
[01:37:16.677 --> 01:37:20.018]  There's directives to demonize us and shut us down.
[01:37:21.118 --> 01:37:22.919]  And by the way, I am so proud of that.
[01:37:23.439 --> 01:37:27.940]  I sleep so good at night being John Hancock at the top of the list.
[01:37:28.861 --> 01:37:31.201]  I mean, I couldn't sign my name bigger on this baby.
[01:37:31.221 --> 01:37:34.502]  I mean, I'm not going to risk my life and then not go 110% into this.
[01:37:36.966 --> 01:37:39.948]  So, whatever happens to me, folks, my soul's clear.
[01:37:39.988 --> 01:37:40.688]  I feel good.
[01:37:41.749 --> 01:37:43.971]  I'm not murdering all those Christians in Syria.
[01:37:44.251 --> 01:37:47.333]  I'm not opening our borders up and bringing people in here to have their babies for free.
[01:37:47.653 --> 01:37:50.635]  I'm not putting cancer viruses and vaccines or feeding GMO to people.
[01:37:51.756 --> 01:37:56.278]  I'm not lying to people, telling them there's no vaccine bad reactions when the insert says it can kill you.
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:01.482]  I'm not pushing glyphosate in the food and water.
[01:38:01.502 --> 01:38:04.244]  I mean, my job's really easy.
[01:38:04.704 --> 01:38:06.205]  I treat people like I want to be treated.
[01:38:08.359 --> 01:38:15.402]  And I think we're in this post-moral world, as Karl Rove told the New York Times and Washington Post, at a cocktail party.
[01:38:17.743 --> 01:38:28.988]  He said, it doesn't matter if Iraq didn't have WMDs, we're just going to say they did and did 9-11, and we'll tell you what history and reality is, and then you will dutifully report that, and tomorrow we may change reality.
[01:38:29.348 --> 01:38:32.069]  And then you'll follow that, because we're history's actors now.
[01:38:33.607 --> 01:38:41.195]  Really, because you inherited the biggest, most wealthy, powerful nation the world has ever seen, and the incredible science and the brains that came here for freedom?
[01:38:42.036 --> 01:38:57.251]  You inherited all that, and then in 50 years have taken us from the biggest creditor nation, the most respected nation, the longest lived nation, the smartest nation, the toughest nation, on every front, and you turned us into the fattest, dumbest, most unhealthy, evil nation?
[01:38:59.827 --> 01:39:12.170]  You took all that and decided that you were God now because you stole the birthright of the Renaissance and then claimed it to you as you try to usher in a new dark age.
[01:39:12.450 --> 01:39:13.690]  You people are a joke.
[01:39:14.190 --> 01:39:16.931]  You're not history's actor now, Karl Rove.
[01:39:17.571 --> 01:39:19.172]  You don't control reality.
[01:39:21.432 --> 01:39:24.933]  Everyone knows your war in Iraq was a fraud for the Saudis and others.
[01:39:28.834 --> 01:39:32.717]  Fool me once, shame on you.
[01:39:33.338 --> 01:39:34.999]  Fool me twice, shame on me.
[01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:36.000]  Well, you know what?
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:37.462]  America is starting to wake up.
[01:39:37.722 --> 01:39:40.825]  And I don't mean the couch potatoes that just want to watch football all day and act tough.
[01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:46.594]  America, the real men and women of this country of every race, color and creed are waking up and the world's waking up.
[01:39:46.614 --> 01:39:47.434]  We're not going along with it.
[01:39:48.155 --> 01:39:50.156]  John and I, I'm going to hurry to Maverick and others.
[01:39:50.236 --> 01:39:51.957]  I'm just pontificating here today.
[01:39:53.078 --> 01:39:54.940]  Finish up your points about where this is going.
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:59.863]  I mean, I can't imagine when there's a real Great Depression again in this country, what all these trendies are going to do.
[01:40:00.584 --> 01:40:04.226]  I can't imagine what all the 50 million people on food stamps are going to do.
[01:40:04.707 --> 01:40:05.847]  Electronic soup kitchens.
[01:40:06.288 --> 01:40:07.288]  I can't imagine.
[01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:18.637]  What all these soft, entitled people, you know, the Black Lives Matter crowd that equated the 130 dead in France to a poop swastika and what they've gone through.
[01:40:19.278 --> 01:40:27.804]  I can't imagine what's going to happen when we get into a major depression where all this is going and they always start a war, so it all fits together.
[01:40:28.385 --> 01:40:31.267]  When the economy goes down, they take you to war, as Zolente says.
[01:40:31.687 --> 01:40:33.789]  I want to get him on as soon as possible to cover all this.
[01:40:34.509 --> 01:40:36.231]  This is just an epic time to be alive.
[01:40:36.491 --> 01:40:37.552]  Go ahead and finish your points, John.
[01:40:38.630 --> 01:40:39.070]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:39.931]  You know, absolutely.
[01:40:39.971 --> 01:40:41.772]  You're 110% correct, Alex.
[01:40:41.952 --> 01:40:48.396]  And like I said on my radio program every Sunday, I speak along the exact same lines and fire the exact same bullet points out.
[01:40:48.777 --> 01:41:00.304]  You know, the sad thing about it is, is that it's not going to wake the American people up until it literally hits them at their dinner plate and literally pulls their wallet out and takes the rest of whatever they've already not gotten
[01:41:01.044 --> 01:41:03.926]  You know, and yes, sir, you said you'd let me plug my show.
[01:41:04.046 --> 01:41:11.069]  I'm on every Sunday from 7 to 9 Central, 8 to 10 Eastern Standard Time, Revolution Radio at freedomslips.com.
[01:41:11.250 --> 01:41:17.433]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that is Revolution Radio at freedomslips.com with yours truly, John Wayne.
[01:41:18.073 --> 01:41:25.397]  I want to thank you very much, Alex, for having me on and being able to throw some more out there to the way I see where things are going.
[01:41:25.897 --> 01:41:27.819]  And by God, we need to stand up.
[01:41:27.959 --> 01:41:30.340]  And the one word that we all need to use
[01:41:31.355 --> 01:41:37.699]  Time and time again, it's one of the very first words that we've ever learned from ever since the very day we're born is the word no.
[01:41:38.219 --> 01:41:39.940]  The word no is very powerful.
[01:41:40.341 --> 01:41:49.106]  If it takes everybody in the country around the world to stand up and say no in unison, no you're not doing this, no we're not taking it, no we're not having it.
[01:41:49.950 --> 01:41:54.251]  It takes that, but we have got to wake up the sleeping giant.
[01:41:54.311 --> 01:41:59.392]  By God, I'll tell you what, Alex, be safe, God bless, and God bless your listeners and my listeners out there.
[01:41:59.412 --> 01:42:00.332]  All right, brother, thank you.
[01:42:00.352 --> 01:42:07.914]  All right, I want to hurry through calls now because Maverick's been holding a long time, Randy's been holding a long time, and others.
[01:42:09.214 --> 01:42:11.535]  Brendan has ex-Air Force Turkey experience.
[01:42:12.475 --> 01:42:14.255]  Maverick is a pilot, so I want to get to everybody.
[01:42:14.835 --> 01:42:15.836]  We got two Mavericks?
[01:42:15.876 --> 01:42:16.796]  I've never seen that before.
[01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:21.402]  Maverick in Colorado, you worked on a cultural project in Turkey.
[01:42:21.422 --> 01:42:21.983]  Thanks for holding.
[01:42:24.044 --> 01:42:40.977]  Hey Alex, I just kind of wanted to talk a little bit about my experience working for five years as an assistant to a world-renowned cryptanalyst intelligence advisor who basically was involved with cultural projects and I was just going along for the ride.
[01:42:42.097 --> 01:42:44.419]  Back in 2005, he told me to pay attention
[01:42:46.124 --> 01:43:00.350]  To a young senator from Chicago, who he had known in Hawaii, and that the young man had a significant name, because this was going to be the president who would be used to create a Shiite calistate.
[01:43:00.971 --> 01:43:10.435]  So the stuff that I worked on with this individual had, you know, it was framed for a Shiite calistate, and I had known about this all the way back in 2005.
[01:43:10.495 --> 01:43:13.336]  So let's go ahead and jump forward.
[01:43:14.833 --> 01:43:21.558]  2008.
[01:43:15.173 --> 01:43:21.558]  2008, we're in Turkey, working on cultural projects for what was called Istanbul 2010.
[01:43:22.538 --> 01:43:25.300]  This was to bring Turkey into the European Union.
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:37.290]  To make a long story short, the financial advisor disappeared, cultural projects were cancelled, and George Soros ended up with $150 million that was supposed to go to the project.
[01:43:38.170 --> 01:43:39.271]  Let's jump forward to 2011.
[01:43:41.573 --> 01:43:44.334]  I went up to Canada to work with this individual again.
[01:43:44.834 --> 01:44:01.558]  This time, this was for projects that were going to be happening in Tunisia in August of 2011, where we were going to be doing cultural exchanges of indigenous people, and this was going to bring a large group of Syrians to Canada.
[01:44:02.608 --> 01:44:08.352]  So in hindsight, plus other things I'm not mentioning... Sure, these cultural projects are covers.
[01:44:08.412 --> 01:44:10.453]  It wasn't really about bringing Turkey into the Euro.
[01:44:10.473 --> 01:44:23.662]  It was about preparing all these different operations, preparing the migrant floods, getting the change agents in place on the ground, the social organizers, the community organizers for the takeover of Europe.
[01:44:25.343 --> 01:44:25.863]  Exactly.
[01:44:25.923 --> 01:44:32.167]  And so when you see these things from the cultural side, there's so much prep work that goes into it.
[01:44:32.708 --> 01:44:37.616]  It's amazing how much time, you know, how much of this was in advance.
[01:44:38.237 --> 01:44:42.944]  I'm talking to you about stuff that was being organized 10 years ago that we're now seeing.
[01:44:43.504 --> 01:44:45.728]  What people need to understand is these things
[01:44:46.317 --> 01:44:47.598]  No, ISIS and all this stuff.
[01:44:47.638 --> 01:44:49.740]  This stuff just doesn't happen overnight.
[01:44:50.201 --> 01:44:54.444]  And it doesn't just pop out of nowhere.
[01:44:54.464 --> 01:44:58.528]  They had the ISIS plan ready before the globalist stage 9-11 with Saudi Arabia.
[01:44:59.009 --> 01:45:04.353]  And their payoff the whole time was to give the entire region to Saudi Arabia for just halfway taking the blame.
[01:45:05.094 --> 01:45:06.934]  But then physically Iraq would be attacked.
[01:45:06.995 --> 01:45:08.155]  It's totally insane.
[01:45:08.475 --> 01:45:10.835]  And when you pull back, then you can go research every part of it.
[01:45:11.156 --> 01:45:14.296]  The CFR writes white papers admitting all this.
[01:45:14.676 --> 01:45:16.857]  What's crazy is they admit it all.
[01:45:18.177 --> 01:45:22.598]  A couple years ago they had a headline, Why We Need Al Qaeda In Syria and how great they are.
[01:45:23.959 --> 01:45:28.260]  But then you'll have some dumbed down TSA person wanting to stick their hands down my pants.
[01:45:30.441 --> 01:45:31.943]  To make sure there's not a bomb there.
[01:45:32.143 --> 01:45:35.646]  I mean, it's just ridiculous while they leave the borders wide open.
[01:45:36.007 --> 01:45:37.168]  Amazing call, Maverick.
[01:45:37.188 --> 01:45:38.269]  Anything else you want to relay?
[01:45:39.751 --> 01:45:40.151]  Well, yeah.
[01:45:40.211 --> 01:45:46.337]  Whenever I would travel with this guy, we had free, you know, we never got stopped by TSA.
[01:45:46.357 --> 01:45:51.403]  In fact, they would pull us to a special line where we could just hustle right through.
[01:45:53.584 --> 01:46:01.289]  I mean, I just, I could go on for days... Well sure, if you actually join the people running the Jihad Takeover, Saudi Arabians don't get searched when they come in either.
[01:46:01.809 --> 01:46:08.574]  When you're part of the club, it's like the Rockefellers told Russo, you know, you get the chip, it's the kiss my butt, get out of jail free card.
[01:46:09.394 --> 01:46:18.800]  And that's why people want to enter this, is because it's the new classism, it's the new discrimination, it's the new titles of nobility, it's the new letters of mark, it's being above the law.
[01:46:19.521 --> 01:46:21.122]  God bless you, I appreciate your call, Maverick.
[01:46:22.543 --> 01:46:24.285]  I'm actually aware of those projects you're talking about.
[01:46:24.325 --> 01:46:29.149]  They spent billions getting ready for this migrant takeover in the last decade.
[01:46:29.189 --> 01:46:31.611]  They spent billions getting ready for the overthrow of Ukraine.
[01:46:32.232 --> 01:46:35.795]  And then the argument is, well, if we don't, Russia will take over the Middle East.
[01:46:35.915 --> 01:46:39.018]  Russia isn't taking squat over.
[01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:43.062]  Russia can't even get its own affairs in place.
[01:46:43.462 --> 01:46:47.246]  Russia's weak politically after the globalists annihilated it for 97 years.
[01:46:49.215 --> 01:46:55.140]  It's because Russia might try to get back on its knees and off its belly that the globalists want to finish killing it.
[01:46:55.781 --> 01:47:01.886]  Just like they want to kill your church, and kill your job, and destroy your family, and ship drugs in for your kids to use.
[01:47:02.346 --> 01:47:06.910]  They want to screw everybody over, because the Russians are humans, and they're red-blooded just like us.
[01:47:07.591 --> 01:47:08.411]  That's why they hate them.
[01:47:10.873 --> 01:47:13.716]  There's a big orthodox revival going on over there.
[01:47:14.276 --> 01:47:17.119]  The Russians really want what they couldn't have for 80-something years.
[01:47:18.186 --> 01:47:24.511]  And the globalists hate it that there's a Christian country of 150 million people and they're dedicated to annihilating it.
[01:47:25.172 --> 01:47:26.673]  Just like they want to hurt you and your family.
[01:47:26.954 --> 01:47:27.574]  Same story.
[01:47:29.236 --> 01:47:30.637]  Randy, Brendan, Maverick.
[01:47:32.198 --> 01:47:33.980]  Let's go to Brendan, then Randy, then Maverick.
[01:47:35.201 --> 01:47:36.822]  Brendan in Idaho, you're on the air.
[01:47:37.062 --> 01:47:37.643]  Thank you for holding.
[01:47:37.663 --> 01:47:39.825]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[01:47:41.075 --> 01:47:43.416]  Yeah, I just wanted to comment real quick.
[01:47:43.577 --> 01:47:47.038]  I was over in Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, 93, 94, 95.
[01:47:48.839 --> 01:47:55.362]  And at the time we had the Northern No-Fly Zone over Iraq.
[01:47:55.523 --> 01:47:59.905]  We had the NATO contingent there, the French, British, American, and Turkish Air Forces.
[01:48:01.185 --> 01:48:03.567]  And then we had the Operation Provide Comfort.
[01:48:05.067 --> 01:48:09.890]  But I quickly realized after talking to pilots and crew and figuring out what was going on,
[01:48:11.234 --> 01:48:27.607]  You know, while the Turks would take off in our old F-4 Phantoms that we sold them and bomb the Kurdish people in the east, the PKK would come down and attack us and attack the base and the Turks.
[01:48:28.388 --> 01:48:37.956]  And then from the same airstrip, from the very same airstrip, the American contingent would fly C-130s over and drop pallets of Band-Aids and
[01:48:38.832 --> 01:48:41.014]  And MREs and water bottles.
[01:48:41.635 --> 01:48:47.119]  And what you were witnessing was full spectrum dominance with a globalist control the entire paradigm.
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:49.542]  Please continue.
[01:48:49.582 --> 01:49:00.591]  Yeah, so that's basically, and this was, you know, basically 21, you know, 2021 years ago when that was going on and, you know, being a younger man, you know, you and I are the same age, Alex.
[01:49:00.651 --> 01:49:05.696]  And so at that time, you know, I was joining the service after high school thinking I'm doing a, you know,
[01:49:06.534 --> 01:49:14.380]  A great thing for my country, and then once I figured out what was going on, I decided that, you know, this isn't what I signed up for, and this isn't what I want to be involved in.
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:16.762]  Were other people at the base putting 2 and 2 together?
[01:49:16.782 --> 01:49:19.644]  Uh, they were, they were.
[01:49:19.684 --> 01:49:35.457]  It wasn't, remember, this was back in the, you know, early mid-90s, so, you know, the internet wasn't, uh, you know, it was really just taken off, and so word wasn't getting spread around as easily and as quickly as it is now, compared to then, but, uh,
[01:49:36.135 --> 01:49:40.117]  You know, I would talk to pilots and crew, people from different squadrons.
[01:49:41.637 --> 01:49:46.259]  Do you have any idea what you're involved with here?
[01:49:47.639 --> 01:50:00.324]  From the very same airstrip, the Turkish Air Force would drop bombs on the Kurdish people, and then American C-130s would take off an hour or two hours later, slower aircraft,
[01:50:00.934 --> 01:50:04.837]  And drop pallets of humanitarian aid on the same people who were just bombed.
[01:50:04.857 --> 01:50:06.438]  So it makes absolutely no sense.
[01:50:07.639 --> 01:50:12.562]  Give you the vaccine that then makes you sick ten years later, and then they have all these patented treatments for it.
[01:50:12.882 --> 01:50:14.003]  It's full spectrum dominance.
[01:50:14.063 --> 01:50:15.264]  It's problem, reaction, solution.
[01:50:15.564 --> 01:50:17.805]  Ship the drugs in, put your kids in prison for using them.
[01:50:18.246 --> 01:50:21.588]  Then put them in prisons for 25 cents an hour, displacing everybody else's jobs.
[01:50:21.848 --> 01:50:27.052]  And the good old boy goes good, make them prisoners work, but doesn't know why his son can't get a good paying job.
[01:50:27.512 --> 01:50:28.593]  Full spectrum dominance.
[01:50:28.633 --> 01:50:29.293]  Consolidate.
[01:50:29.633 --> 01:50:30.014]  Control.
[01:50:31.027 --> 01:50:34.610]  And obviously the Kurds have their beef with Turkey because Turkey took part of their land.
[01:50:35.210 --> 01:50:36.291]  Let's not choose a side.
[01:50:36.691 --> 01:50:44.938]  The point is, you don't bomb them and then run a psych warfare op where you drop band-aids on them to make them think you're actually on their side.
[01:50:45.378 --> 01:50:49.962]  And that's the type of double, triple, quadruple dealing that goes on.
[01:50:49.982 --> 01:50:50.883]  But it's way beyond that.
[01:50:50.923 --> 01:50:59.890]  They caught British Special Forces, this was in the Leningradian, in 2005, dressed up like Wahhabis attacking Shiites to get a civil war going in Iraq.
[01:51:00.734 --> 01:51:01.895]  You ask what's the endgame?
[01:51:02.015 --> 01:51:02.515]  Chaos.
[01:51:02.895 --> 01:51:03.996]  Breaking down society.
[01:51:04.316 --> 01:51:06.237]  Trillions in no-bid weapons contracts.
[01:51:06.617 --> 01:51:08.298]  Maverick, you're up next, and then Randy.
[01:51:08.558 --> 01:51:09.038]  Stay with us.
[01:51:09.819 --> 01:51:11.000]  Are you prepared to bug out?

[01:51:39.658 --> 01:51:41.059]  So listen up here, guys.
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:45.841]  My buddy Mark, he overhears the management team at Guns80.com.
[01:51:47.262 --> 01:51:56.249]  And what they're saying is that between now and Black Friday, they're going to put a special on the website at guns80.com every day.
[01:51:56.810 --> 01:52:04.195]  What that means is that you have to go to guns80.com every day to check out the specials between now and Black Friday.
[01:52:04.796 --> 01:52:08.238]  Go to guns80.com, but don't tell them you heard it from me.
[01:52:09.255 --> 01:52:20.778]  My fellow Patreons, anyone that listens to my broadcast for any length of time knows that I can't stand Black Friday, a mindless, idiotic exercise in pure blind consumerism.
[01:52:21.098 --> 01:52:22.238]  I'm for prosperity.
[01:52:22.318 --> 01:52:31.460]  I'm for having good products that make our lives better, but I don't just mindlessly worship the holiday where we're supposedly getting the best deal ever, and statistics show it's one of the worst days to shop.
[01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:34.561]  That's why we are taking the info war to the next level and
[01:52:34.721 --> 01:52:35.422]  We're good to go.
[01:52:55.336 --> 01:52:59.938]  You're getting super high quality products at the lowest prices and you're getting free shipping.
[01:53:00.118 --> 01:53:01.919]  InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:53:08.735 --> 01:53:12.920]  The following is an important holiday inventory announcement from IDStronghold.com.
[01:53:13.581 --> 01:53:28.799]  As many of you have come to know, IDStronghold.com is the number one name in quality RFID blocking wallets that actually do as they say and prevent electronic pickpocketing of the new RFID chips found in credit cards, room keys, subway passes, and more.
[01:53:29.279 --> 01:53:38.601]  Last year, due to the extreme popularity of giving ID Stronghold wallets and clutches as unique gifts at Christmas time, we ran out of our most popular styles and colors early.
[01:53:38.901 --> 01:53:42.922]  The good news is, we now have our holiday inventory ready for same-day shipping.
[01:53:43.243 --> 01:53:54.425]  We have added many more designs of beautiful leather wallets and clutches, all with state-of-the-art built-in electronic pickpocket shielding from the most respected name in RFID protection, IDStronghold.com.
[01:53:54.745 --> 01:53:57.246]  Don't wait and limit your choices of these great gifts.
[01:53:57.606 --> 01:53:59.971]  We are expecting another sellout season.
[01:53:59.991 --> 01:54:01.694]  These wallets aren't available in stores.
[01:54:02.094 --> 01:54:04.579]  So visit IDStronghold.com today.
[01:54:04.899 --> 01:54:06.222]  That's IDStronghold.com.
[01:54:17.470 --> 01:54:19.951]  Everybody knows.
[01:54:20.151 --> 01:54:24.872]  Alright, Brendan's got a final point, then Maverick, Randy, Sidney, and others.
[01:54:24.892 --> 01:54:27.493]  We're going to continue with calls into the next hour.
[01:54:27.553 --> 01:54:29.373]  I will hit some of the other U.S.
[01:54:29.413 --> 01:54:30.633]  news, economy news.
[01:54:31.734 --> 01:54:34.414]  But, here's the deal.
[01:54:35.355 --> 01:54:38.275]  False flags, manipulations, they are part of warfare.
[01:54:40.376 --> 01:54:44.557]  But you, in history, only did that against other men who were combatants.
[01:54:46.198 --> 01:54:47.778]  And still that was seen as dirty and evil.
[01:54:48.699 --> 01:54:51.179]  And it wasn't that people were wimps during the age of chivalry.
[01:54:51.699 --> 01:54:54.280]  It was that they didn't want their women and children being involved.
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:57.560]  And once things get dirty, they get dirty real fast.
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:05.382]  So if one side's playing dirty, and the other side isn't, well then, the folks that are playing dirty think they're real smart.
[01:55:06.462 --> 01:55:08.942]  But once things get dirty, you find out it's not smart at all, is it?
[01:55:10.883 --> 01:55:11.203]  And so,
[01:55:12.594 --> 01:55:16.975]  Compared to other countries, America was not as corrupt, so we had the moral high ground, even though we didn't deserve it.
[01:55:18.095 --> 01:55:19.096]  That's all gone now.
[01:55:20.236 --> 01:55:30.419]  So the business where they're taking off from the same airfield, which has come out in the news before, that they were aiding the Turks in bombing the Kurds, and that's on record what he's telling you about.
[01:55:30.439 --> 01:55:31.579]  He just witnessed it, though.
[01:55:32.599 --> 01:55:34.400]  That type of Machiavellian garbage
[01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:39.495]  Doesn't work anymore because everybody knows our government's supplying ISIS and not really bombing them.
[01:55:39.515 --> 01:55:42.098]  You see, because we're now known as evil.
[01:55:42.899 --> 01:55:44.341]  We're now known as liars.
[01:55:46.603 --> 01:55:51.729]  Oh, and so how smart are the little delicate geniuses up in Washington that flushed our good name down the toilet?
[01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:53.872]  Brendan, finish your point, sorry.
[01:55:55.658 --> 01:55:57.560]  Oh, no, I appreciate it again, Alex.
[01:55:57.580 --> 01:55:57.961]  Thank you.
[01:55:58.802 --> 01:56:05.710]  What I was going to add to that was, you know, watching Turkey, keeping an eye on them over the years and studying some of the history.
[01:56:05.730 --> 01:56:13.219]  You know, Turkey's really in that precarious spot there geographically.
[01:56:14.077 --> 01:56:16.479]  Uh, just below Russia, right there next to the Middle East.
[01:56:16.539 --> 01:56:38.477]  So, uh, you know, I had a feeling when all this got cranked up, uh, that Turkey was going to be, was going to end up being directly involved front and center, uh, just, just by, you know, the very nature of where it's located and, and, uh, you know, who all can, can, uh, operate in an inside and outside of Turkey, uh, more so, uh, Eastern Turkey.
[01:56:39.481 --> 01:56:49.426]  And so, like I said, you know, those incidents were going on well over 20 years ago before all this current business got started.
[01:56:49.726 --> 01:56:50.106]  You're right.
[01:56:50.226 --> 01:56:50.966]  God bless you, sir.
[01:56:50.986 --> 01:56:51.887]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:52.227 --> 01:56:53.907]  I'm not going to cut Maverick and then Randy short.
[01:56:53.927 --> 01:56:54.528]  We're going to go to break.
[01:56:54.548 --> 01:56:55.488]  This is a short segment.
[01:56:55.908 --> 01:56:56.709]  Come back with your calls.
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:01.262]  But just great callers, great points from people that were there, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:01.602 --> 01:57:10.568]  And it's one thing to historically be able to look this up and know it's true, but to hear it from the participants is really another level of dimension and illustration.
[01:57:13.290 --> 01:57:21.294]  Most, and we have a special report on Black Friday, I'm going to play it eight after next hour, that Liam McAdoo did that's pretty powerful, folks thinking the word Black Friday's racist, so ban it.
[01:57:21.935 --> 01:57:23.075]  We're not joking, that's coming up.
[01:57:24.201 --> 01:57:27.882]  A lot of specials on Black Friday, on average, are not the best times to shop.
[01:57:28.442 --> 01:57:30.742]  I mean, there's articles in USA Today, New York Times.
[01:57:30.762 --> 01:57:31.803]  I mean, that's an admitted fact.
[01:57:32.623 --> 01:57:37.464]  Usually, it's the middle of nowhere, you know, time of year when people are overstocked on something when you get the best deal.
[01:57:38.824 --> 01:57:43.905]  We genuinely are just out of the gates offering something we usually only offer during Christmas.
[01:57:44.925 --> 01:57:46.546]  We're doing a little bit early this year.
[01:57:46.566 --> 01:57:52.887]  We'll do it again in a few weeks right around Christmas, but we're offering free shipping right now
[01:57:54.073 --> 01:57:59.156]  Until next Monday, for Black Friday, on Everything and InfowarsStore.com.
[01:58:00.217 --> 01:58:00.697]  Free shipping.
[01:58:01.318 --> 01:58:01.938]  That's a big deal.
[01:58:02.278 --> 01:58:06.081]  That's on storable food, that's on water filters, on things like that, that's a huge savings.
[01:58:06.641 --> 01:58:08.762]  You know, on a bottle of vitamins, it's not that big a savings.
[01:58:09.363 --> 01:58:16.047]  But, the minerals, the vitamins, the nutraceuticals, we've got specials on them on top of it, so it is a great deal.
[01:58:17.468 --> 01:58:20.370]  33% off on DNA Force, huge deal.
[01:58:21.931 --> 01:58:22.591]  Brain Force, 30% off.

[01:58:35.444 --> 01:58:37.386]  We need the funds to continue.
[01:58:37.446 --> 01:58:41.388]  It's expensive to send our reporters to France and stuff like that to give you the coverage you deserve and need.
[01:58:41.648 --> 01:58:47.311]  So thank you for standing with us as partners and getting the word out and shopping with the good guys at Infowarsstore.com.

[01:59:37.644 --> 01:59:40.785]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:59:40.925 --> 01:59:44.126]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:59:44.406 --> 01:59:46.207]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:59:46.387 --> 01:59:48.267]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.

[02:00:01.644 --> 02:00:04.255]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:15.663 --> 02:00:19.846]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:20.507 --> 02:00:21.308]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.088 --> 02:00:22.989]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.630 --> 02:00:27.273]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.813 --> 02:00:31.876]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.069 --> 02:00:35.750]  Alright Maverick, you've been a real trooper, and so has Randy.
[02:00:37.490 --> 02:00:39.291]  In fact, Randy's been holding so long, we put him on hold.
[02:00:39.311 --> 02:00:41.291]  I'll give him a free Hillary for prison t-shirt.
[02:00:41.491 --> 02:00:42.112]  Limited edition.
[02:00:42.132 --> 02:00:43.632]  We're gonna go to him in a second.
[02:00:44.012 --> 02:00:45.753]  Maverick, in Texas, is a pilot.
[02:00:46.393 --> 02:00:53.115]  What's your take on the shoot-down of this Russian aircraft and then blowing up the rescue helicopter well inside Syria with a U.S.-made TOW missile?
[02:00:53.735 --> 02:00:59.897]  I mean, this is just sickening, and now the Russians have said there's gonna be a grievous response to the Turks.
[02:00:59.937 --> 02:01:00.357]  What do you think?
[02:01:02.253 --> 02:01:03.353]  Alex, it's simple.
[02:01:04.774 --> 02:01:07.934]  Solving 9-11 ends the war.
[02:01:10.015 --> 02:01:26.138]  Christopher Bolin, in his book and lectures, Solving 9-11, The Deception That Changed the World, is an indictment of those at the top responsible for 9-11, the real terrorists.
[02:01:27.398 --> 02:01:29.919]  Everything that we discussed thus far
[02:01:31.135 --> 02:01:39.441]  is only a byproduct and it means that these same people are still running the criminal elements.
[02:01:39.501 --> 02:01:46.185]  These are the criminal elements you always speak to that are inside our government even today.
[02:01:46.205 --> 02:01:51.189]  Well, I haven't read Boland's book.
[02:01:51.849 --> 02:01:54.051]  I think I may have interviewed that guy like 15 years ago or something.
[02:01:54.091 --> 02:01:54.912]  He went off the radar.
[02:01:54.972 --> 02:01:56.813]  He wrote for American Free Press, didn't he?
[02:01:58.328 --> 02:02:09.322]  He was an investigative journalist at the time of 9-11, happened to be in New York City, and was being paid to, and encouraged, his specials were false flags.
[02:02:10.303 --> 02:02:14.809]  And also, Dr. Steven Jones, who he'll speak to... Well, I've interviewed him.
[02:02:14.929 --> 02:02:16.011]  I've interviewed him a bunch, yeah.
[02:02:17.512 --> 02:02:18.053]  You have.
[02:02:18.113 --> 02:02:27.424]  There's about seven doctors that have signed on to papers that have been extremely peer-reviewed that end the debate as to the official story of 9-11.
[02:02:27.484 --> 02:02:36.535]  The nanothermite that is detectable, reproducible, and using the most high-tech equipment shows there's no way Osama bin Laden
[02:02:37.045 --> 02:02:40.206]  Which takes months to install the NanoThermite.
[02:02:40.266 --> 02:02:41.627]  Had anything to do with that?
[02:02:41.647 --> 02:02:42.848]  No, I understand they blew up Building 7.
[02:02:43.268 --> 02:02:45.029]  I've got Jones and films I made.
[02:02:45.049 --> 02:02:47.650]  I mean, really, I'm aware of 9-11 Truth.
[02:02:47.690 --> 02:02:48.850]  I started it, literally.
[02:02:49.971 --> 02:02:54.733]  The issue is, we can prove on the 28 pages that Saudi Arabia was involved.
[02:02:55.233 --> 02:02:56.494]  Our government ordered a stand down.
[02:02:57.634 --> 02:02:58.515]  That's been proven.
[02:02:58.715 --> 02:03:00.516]  That opens up the whole deal.
[02:03:00.596 --> 02:03:01.876]  Then you find everything out.
[02:03:02.416 --> 02:03:04.857]  If you go to the public, get into NanoThermite, which I've done.
[02:03:04.877 --> 02:03:05.718]  I've made films about it.
[02:03:06.969 --> 02:03:22.319]  Then, they can try to debate it, even if, I mean, you're correct, and the National NIST has admitted that Building 7 fell at free fall, and I've interviewed the firefighters that saw the molten lava, and they admitted the bombs, and they blew up Building 7 and announced it beforehand.
[02:03:22.579 --> 02:03:23.399]  Believe me, I know.
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:26.021]  I put on the 9-11 event in L.A.
[02:03:26.041 --> 02:03:26.861]  that was on C-SPAN.
[02:03:28.002 --> 02:03:28.302]  All of it.
[02:03:28.863 --> 02:03:30.484]  They got death threats out the wazoo.
[02:03:31.384 --> 02:03:35.186]  It's just now, people say, well, why do you go to something that only shows part of it, like the 28 pages?
[02:03:37.409 --> 02:03:39.611]  It's like getting Al Capone on his taxes.
[02:03:41.012 --> 02:03:42.113]  Now, you say you're a pilot.
[02:03:42.173 --> 02:03:44.195]  I specifically, we're kind of getting to 9-11 now.
[02:03:44.955 --> 02:03:49.138]  I wanted to get your take on the shoot down of the aircraft real quick and the situation with the helicopter.
[02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:52.501]  Yes, and this all goes back to 9-11.
[02:03:52.901 --> 02:03:58.346]  Cybele Edmonds, who blew the whistle almost initially, the most gag woman in history, has already
[02:04:00.783 --> 02:04:02.144]  Yes, you have, and I'm fine.
[02:04:02.425 --> 02:04:02.925]  Thank God.
[02:04:03.325 --> 02:04:13.414]  But she has already drawn all evidence, testimony, and connection between the Turks that were running Dennis Hastert, now known as a pedophile, under control of larger forces.
[02:04:13.454 --> 02:04:14.696]  Now, I need to say this.
[02:04:14.776 --> 02:04:19.700]  Christopher Bolin lays out the people, and they have one organization.
[02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:21.141]  It's PNAC at a low level.
[02:04:21.602 --> 02:04:22.923]  It is a Zionist.
[02:04:23.576 --> 02:04:27.678]  Movement and the Bible speaks to the Jews that say they are Jews and are not.
[02:04:28.258 --> 02:04:30.780]  And in other words, Satanic... Synagogue of Satan.
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:31.140]  Synagogue.
[02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:32.080]  And this goes on today.
[02:04:32.661 --> 02:04:32.841]  Yeah.
[02:04:33.281 --> 02:04:38.623]  You know, I mean, there's obviously a Jewish mafia involved at the highest levels in the world, or the Rothschilds, the rest of it.
[02:04:38.643 --> 02:04:41.045]  I'm not denying the fact that that's there.
[02:04:41.625 --> 02:04:48.488]  My only issue is people act like corrupt people in Israel have the corner on Machiavellian operations.
[02:04:49.109 --> 02:04:49.649]  And I just...
[02:04:51.238 --> 02:04:52.200]  That's where I go with this.
[02:04:52.260 --> 02:04:55.704]  I don't think Israel is the only mover in all of this.
[02:04:55.744 --> 02:04:56.926]  I mean, look at Israel.
[02:04:56.946 --> 02:04:59.229]  They're killing their own presidents and prime ministers.
[02:05:00.151 --> 02:05:02.113]  I mean, so I just don't think it's one monolith.
[02:05:02.133 --> 02:05:06.940]  I mean, the folks that think Israel run everything, they think I actually am Jewish and I get orders from Israel.
[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:08.142]  I mean, it's just not true.
[02:05:09.554 --> 02:05:15.018]  Hamtramck, Michigan is experiencing culture shock after becoming the first majority Muslim city in the U.S.
[02:05:15.278 --> 02:05:21.922]  For example, business owners routinely advertise their products in Arabic and they can't obtain liquor licenses within 500 feet of a mosque.
[02:05:22.223 --> 02:05:27.246]  But besides this cultural shift, Hamtramck also serves as a microcosm of America's economy.
[02:05:27.486 --> 02:05:32.790]  Hamtramck was the home of a Chrysler automobile plant back during the muscle car era of the 60s and early 70s.
[02:05:33.490 --> 02:05:37.352]  Everything from Plymouth Barracudas to Dodge Chargers were built at the Hamtramck plant.
[02:05:37.512 --> 02:05:40.514]  But now the plant is closed down just like America's manufacturing base.
[02:05:40.774 --> 02:05:41.215]  When the U.S.
[02:05:41.255 --> 02:05:45.257]  dollar was chosen as the international medium of exchange decades ago, the U.S.
[02:05:45.277 --> 02:05:46.978]  still had a strong manufacturing base.
[02:05:47.138 --> 02:05:52.642]  But now it doesn't, and the only reason why we're still able to maintain a trade deficit is due to global demand for the dollar.
[02:05:52.762 --> 02:05:58.125]  But eventually other countries will stop accepting dollars for their products because we barely manufacture anything anymore.
[02:05:58.365 --> 02:05:59.506]  When that happens, the U.S.
[02:05:59.546 --> 02:06:03.287]  economy will close down just like the Hamtramck automobile plant did so many years ago.
[02:06:03.508 --> 02:06:08.150]  This is Kit Daniels, and visit InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv for more reports.
[02:06:09.491 --> 02:06:21.039]  My fellow patriots, anyone that listens to my broadcast for any length of time knows that I can't stand Black Friday, a mindless, idiotic exercise in pure blind consumerism.
[02:06:21.339 --> 02:06:22.480]  I'm for prosperity.
[02:06:22.540 --> 02:06:31.686]  I'm for having good products that make our lives better, but I don't just mindlessly worship the holiday where we're supposedly getting the best deal ever, and statistics show it's one of the worst days to shop.
[02:06:31.926 --> 02:06:39.211]  That's why we are taking the InfoWar to the next level and actually making InfoWarStore.com Black Friday a super deal.

[02:07:09.144 --> 02:07:09.644]  I want more candy!
[02:07:09.664 --> 02:07:10.745]  I want more video games!
[02:07:10.805 --> 02:07:10.925]  Mine!
[02:07:10.985 --> 02:07:11.185]  Mine!
[02:07:11.505 --> 02:07:12.025]  Mine!
[02:07:12.326 --> 02:07:21.710]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:07:22.050 --> 02:07:24.632]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:07:24.752 --> 02:07:28.113]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:07:28.294 --> 02:07:31.035]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system.
[02:07:31.175 --> 02:07:31.375]  I'm good.
[02:07:52.090 --> 02:07:53.611]  There's a powerful calming formula out there.
[02:07:53.872 --> 02:08:01.158]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[02:08:01.418 --> 02:08:04.881]  Obtain your ChildEase today at Infowarslife.com.

[02:08:19.096 --> 02:08:22.660]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:08:23.260 --> 02:08:25.062]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:26.864 --> 02:08:33.711]  Alright, I'm going to take one more call for now on the downing of the Russian aircraft and the jihadis blowing up the rescue helicopter.
[02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:45.914]  If you're not a TV viewer or radio listener, you really should go to Infowars.com and actually watch the footage shot by the jihadis over the Turkey border, a mile and a half into Syria, blowing up the rescue helicopter.
[02:08:46.615 --> 02:08:52.357]  After they leave the dead bodies of the pilots they've killed out there for the helicopter to land and get them, and then blowing it up.
[02:08:55.038 --> 02:09:00.660]  I mean, just to see Russia fighting actual al-Qaeda and Turkey working with them, buying the oil, it's amazing.
[02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:01.781]  I'm going to get into the economy.
[02:09:03.198 --> 02:09:08.519]  A special Black Friday report here in a moment with Leon McAdoo on the street after we talked to Randy in Texas.
[02:09:08.579 --> 02:09:09.760]  Randy, you're a trooper for holding.
[02:09:10.140 --> 02:09:11.880]  Thank you for staying with us, a former Navy.
[02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:13.921]  You're the last caller for now on this subject.
[02:09:13.961 --> 02:09:16.361]  What is your view on this huge escalation?
[02:09:16.401 --> 02:09:19.042]  Again, two dead pilots, the dead helicopter crew.
[02:09:19.062 --> 02:09:22.463]  In the scheme of things, it's a tragedy, but why is it our top story?
[02:09:23.083 --> 02:09:29.865]  Because every analyst out there says this is going to just continue to escalate, and now we've gotten two minutes closer to midnight, in my view.
[02:09:30.205 --> 02:09:30.945]  Randy, what do you say?
[02:09:32.383 --> 02:09:38.189]  Well, I say that it ought to be interesting to see what Russia's response is to this incident.
[02:09:40.152 --> 02:09:51.324]  I figure that probably what they're going to do is step up the attacks on the tanker trucks and completely cut off all that oil that Turkey's been getting.
[02:09:53.922 --> 02:09:54.622]  That's a good idea.
[02:09:54.642 --> 02:09:58.484]  I mean, it's better than, oops, bombs start falling over on the side of Turkey.
[02:09:58.804 --> 02:10:04.666]  I mean, Russia might go ahead and just start bombing the jihadis across the border and just let Turkey have the next move.
[02:10:06.287 --> 02:10:07.807]  Yeah, it could happen that way.
[02:10:08.048 --> 02:10:11.249]  But I think Putin's a lot smarter than that.
[02:10:12.169 --> 02:10:16.751]  He doesn't want to get drug in to protracted ground war over there.
[02:10:19.622 --> 02:10:24.227]  You're absolutely right, but you're kind of like, can't be half pregnant.
[02:10:24.387 --> 02:10:26.970]  You either are or you aren't, and this is a ground war.
[02:10:27.851 --> 02:10:29.332]  And they now are sending in more U.S.
[02:10:29.372 --> 02:10:32.075]  troops to basically back the jihadis and be human shields.
[02:10:32.816 --> 02:10:35.318]  The real war is here in America and in Europe.
[02:10:36.274 --> 02:10:38.075]  To just get the public to see the light of day.
[02:10:38.095 --> 02:10:45.061]  That's all you've got to do is stick your head out the window, open the shades, there it is, you know, ten o'clock in the morning, birds jumping around the backyard.
[02:10:45.141 --> 02:10:56.630]  I mean, just open the door, look at the facts, that our governments are running with jihadis to destabilize the world, they're opening our borders up, bringing them in here to attack us, using the threat of the terrorists to take our rights.
[02:10:57.171 --> 02:11:00.674]  That's the program, and the war is an info war.
[02:11:01.274 --> 02:11:03.616]  Ninety percent of this war is an info war.
[02:11:04.036 --> 02:11:05.518]  It was an info war two years ago.
[02:11:06.277 --> 02:11:06.817]  We're good to go.
[02:11:27.455 --> 02:11:29.376]  The globalist hijackers of the nation.
[02:11:29.456 --> 02:11:32.277]  They have hijacked us, but they don't speak for us.
[02:11:32.297 --> 02:11:35.839]  It'd be like if somebody stole your car and went around running people over with it.
[02:11:36.179 --> 02:11:37.780]  You would want to announce and call the police.
[02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:42.362]  Hey, that's not me with that car I see on the news running folks over with this license plate number.
[02:11:42.662 --> 02:11:43.502]  That was stolen!
[02:11:45.403 --> 02:11:47.904]  And let me help you, you know, find out who might have stolen it.
[02:11:47.924 --> 02:11:50.926]  Because I saw on the news, the video, this guy running people over.
[02:11:52.250 --> 02:11:55.292]  Because if you don't explain, you're not the one driving the car, you're going to go to jail.
[02:11:55.613 --> 02:11:56.253]  Well, it's the same thing.
[02:11:56.393 --> 02:12:00.497]  We've been hijacked, now we're going to try to get our country back.
[02:12:00.997 --> 02:12:06.882]  And if we can't get our country back, by abstention, we become guilty.
[02:12:07.702 --> 02:12:10.204]  And most Americans, I'm just going to say it, I love America.
[02:12:10.785 --> 02:12:12.186]  America is exceptional in many ways.
[02:12:12.226 --> 02:12:17.110]  There's still a lot of good people here, but we've also become exceptionally spoiled and arrogant and evil.
[02:12:19.505 --> 02:12:20.705]  Disconnected from reality.
[02:12:20.725 --> 02:12:22.546]  The average American can't find turkey on a map.
[02:12:24.426 --> 02:12:28.227]  It's like Hillary made a joke when they said, you know, what were you doing with the weapons of turkey from Benghazi?
[02:12:28.267 --> 02:12:30.428]  And she said, what's this about turkeys?
[02:12:31.248 --> 02:12:32.548]  Why are we talking about turkeys?
[02:12:33.328 --> 02:12:38.170]  And everybody laughed because she knew the viewing audience would think that they were talking about a bird.
[02:12:38.550 --> 02:12:40.970]  A 22 pound smoked bird.
[02:12:41.951 --> 02:12:43.171]  Delicious, tasty bird.
[02:12:43.951 --> 02:12:47.512]  I'm thinking about Thanksgiving, but anything else, Randy?
[02:12:48.809 --> 02:12:50.030]  No, that's just about it.
[02:12:50.530 --> 02:12:53.472]  I would like to put in one little note.
[02:12:54.353 --> 02:13:07.082]  I try to wake up people every day, and I'll wake up one or two, and then they go around and start waking up one or two, and that's how we fight the info war.
[02:13:09.644 --> 02:13:10.885]  Very well said, my friend.
[02:13:11.245 --> 02:13:11.786]  God bless you.
[02:13:12.935 --> 02:13:24.619]  By the way, before I was on this JAG today about arming ISIS and all the situation, Matt Drudge, already on the same page, had tweeted, there's an article on Infowars.com, Drudge tweets, America has been arming ISIS.
[02:13:25.119 --> 02:13:25.899]  Here's the full tweet.
[02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:27.380]  A shocking truth is unfolding.
[02:13:27.420 --> 02:13:28.800]  America has been arming ISIS.
[02:13:30.241 --> 02:13:34.742]  And for you, an informed listener, you're like, well, tell us something we don't know.
[02:13:35.443 --> 02:13:38.464]  Well, this is Matt Drudge telling all the mainline Republicans this.
[02:13:38.524 --> 02:13:41.745]  This is Matt Drudge sticking his neck out there.
[02:13:43.277 --> 02:13:45.394]  And then linking to the proof where our own government admits it.
[02:13:48.442 --> 02:13:51.344]  So Steve Watson's article backs up what Drudge is saying.
[02:13:51.864 --> 02:13:56.246]  Very important to get this out to everybody you know, because this can stop the carnage and the evil.
[02:13:56.486 --> 02:14:00.749]  And you can just write off, you know, Syrians say, oh, let them all kill each other, whatever.
[02:14:01.329 --> 02:14:03.610]  Sunni, Shiite, Jihadi, let them do it.
[02:14:04.271 --> 02:14:11.114]  They're doing it to create a conduit to dump the huge migration waves into Turkey right into Europe.
[02:14:11.735 --> 02:14:16.057]  They're blowing up the main southeastern gate of Europe.
[02:14:17.366 --> 02:14:23.108]  You know, Constantinople's the main invasion route the Muslims used before, over and over again.
[02:14:23.748 --> 02:14:25.489]  It's called Istanbul today.
[02:14:25.569 --> 02:14:26.069]  It fell.
[02:14:26.869 --> 02:14:27.830]  It was never retaken.
[02:14:28.930 --> 02:14:31.671]  The great blue cathedrals, now the Blue Mosque.
[02:14:37.813 --> 02:14:42.195]  So, we'll suffer the same fates of those Christians in Syria.
[02:14:45.725 --> 02:14:49.086]  Let's go to this very informative report, also pretty silly.
[02:14:49.547 --> 02:14:53.648]  But I'll say we're not as bad as L.A., where 9 out of 10 people would say, you know, ban Black Friday.
[02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:55.689]  But it's close.
[02:14:55.709 --> 02:15:01.612]  We did find some people that, well, we're just showing you what we found, that said ban Black Friday because it has the word black in it.
[02:15:02.192 --> 02:15:09.075]  And we're illustrating this because, again, they want to ban brown paper bags because it's hurtful, or all these phantoms of racism.
[02:15:09.395 --> 02:15:12.256]  And so the fact that we're all being discriminated against by having our liberties taken.
[02:15:12.576 --> 02:15:14.217]  Here is Leanne McAdoo's report.
[02:15:15.595 --> 02:15:18.817]  Do you think that Black Friday has a racist connotation?
[02:15:20.898 --> 02:15:21.358]  Not really.
[02:15:21.998 --> 02:15:22.738]  Honestly, yeah.
[02:15:23.039 --> 02:15:26.460]  Thinking about that, I'd never really thought about it in that way with racist connotations.
[02:15:27.161 --> 02:15:32.683]  I can see how it could be definitely offensive to people.
[02:15:33.003 --> 02:15:35.525]  I don't know where my opinion stands on it.
[02:15:35.785 --> 02:15:37.486]  As far as that goes...
[02:15:38.490 --> 02:15:44.534]  Sorry, I'm just gonna... I'm not familiar with the historical connotations of Black Friday.
[02:15:44.574 --> 02:15:44.994]  Hit pause.
[02:15:45.554 --> 02:15:50.677]  So I'm... Backing up to the start, I'm gonna skip the network break, but last one of the week I'm gonna be ahead of myself.
[02:15:53.299 --> 02:16:03.905]  When you look at these women and these men, you see helplessness, you see weakness, you see softness to a level never before seen in humans.
[02:16:04.586 --> 02:16:06.367]  You see a disconnection from reality.
[02:16:07.825 --> 02:16:16.772]  A foppish, sycophantic, jellyfish-like spirit.
[02:16:19.194 --> 02:16:22.997]  And it's very frightening because there are armies of these people who have the right to vote.
[02:16:25.339 --> 02:16:30.063]  Who I guarantee you, if you ask those same people, do you support Obama fighting Assad?
[02:16:30.103 --> 02:16:34.987]  They say, oh yes I do, I appreciate him, his Nobel Peace Prize, oh yeah.
[02:16:35.427 --> 02:16:36.048]  I mean these are
[02:16:37.065 --> 02:16:38.066]  Dangerous people.
[02:16:40.368 --> 02:16:44.451]  Like the Mark Dice folks he talks to, where 9 out of 10 say yes, arrest all gun owners.
[02:16:44.991 --> 02:16:46.212]  Okay, we're going to put them in forced labor camps.
[02:16:46.512 --> 02:16:47.613]  Oh yeah, I'm sick of these people.
[02:16:48.974 --> 02:16:56.700]  A lot of these folks would sit by while you and I are putting handcuffs and drug off to some gulag and just sit there on their little piggy hind ends thinking it's all cute.
[02:16:59.642 --> 02:17:04.666]  And they are the product of so much wealth and prosperity created by the free market.
[02:17:06.940 --> 02:17:08.021]  They are the byproduct.
[02:17:09.302 --> 02:17:10.303]  They are the leavings.
[02:17:12.905 --> 02:17:15.247]  And so I want a free market, but it is a paradox.
[02:17:15.948 --> 02:17:19.351]  It creates these spoiled, rotten people.
[02:17:20.372 --> 02:17:23.354]  And my children are spoiled and soft compared to my dad.
[02:17:24.321 --> 02:17:25.341]  Or compared to his father.
[02:17:25.441 --> 02:17:28.142]  I mean, I will tell you right now, we don't have the workout that we did.
[02:17:28.522 --> 02:17:29.002]  I don't have it.
[02:17:29.102 --> 02:17:30.002]  I'm not knocking my kids.
[02:17:30.502 --> 02:17:32.143]  My children are a reflection of me.
[02:17:32.223 --> 02:17:33.043]  They're great children.
[02:17:33.443 --> 02:17:34.043]  Really sweet.
[02:17:34.203 --> 02:17:34.803]  People love them.
[02:17:34.843 --> 02:17:35.363]  They're smart.
[02:17:35.423 --> 02:17:37.244]  Compared to a lot of kids, they're exceptional.
[02:17:37.504 --> 02:17:38.564]  People have seen my son on air.
[02:17:38.644 --> 02:17:41.405]  When he was like 11, he was on air and people were blown away.
[02:17:42.005 --> 02:17:47.246]  I've sat around with former top NASA rocket scientists at dinner and they just, you know, love talking to Rex.
[02:17:48.286 --> 02:17:49.707]  Every dad thinks their kids are exceptional.
[02:17:49.747 --> 02:17:51.227]  But the point is, mine aren't.
[02:17:52.179 --> 02:17:53.400]  And yours are too in different ways.
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:54.981]  Humans are exceptional.
[02:17:57.103 --> 02:18:15.596]  But you just have this entitlement and now they believe you conquer the world by getting in politically correct groups and then bitching and complaining and then finding phantoms of your lost liberty while every basic freedom we've got is being destroyed, being wrecking balled, being demolished, being demolitioned in front of us.
[02:18:19.605 --> 02:18:25.407]  And if they can just feel good about something and say they support it, then they're all goofy and happy.
[02:18:25.687 --> 02:18:29.888]  But if you say, hey, I got some work for you to do in the fight against, oh, oh no, I gotta go, I gotta go.
[02:18:30.549 --> 02:18:34.350]  But if they can like, oh yeah, I can see how that's offensive, don't know the history of it.
[02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:38.831]  Black means from accounting going back more than 400 years in Europe.
[02:18:42.233 --> 02:18:44.477]  Black ink on the ledger is profit.
[02:18:45.298 --> 02:18:46.721]  Red ink is loss.
[02:18:46.821 --> 02:18:50.347]  And when you write something off or it's a loss, you're in the red.
[02:18:52.219 --> 02:19:03.727]  But see, none of these people know what it is to have a business or actually have to run things because they go to college and they get loans and they get hired at government or at Google to just conform.
[02:19:05.268 --> 02:19:06.889]  You're not going to be around in the future.
[02:19:07.310 --> 02:19:13.414]  You're being weakened in the preparation to be soft killed by the fluoride, the GMO and the shots, idiot.
[02:19:14.054 --> 02:19:17.017]  And you won't know when you're 35 dying of cancer why you're dying.
[02:19:17.947 --> 02:19:19.809]  You won't know why your neighbor's 20 and dying.
[02:19:20.109 --> 02:19:23.192]  You won't know why lung cancer's up in the last 20 years sevenfold in women.
[02:19:23.492 --> 02:19:26.235]  You won't know why every other baby's gonna be retarded.
[02:19:26.555 --> 02:19:28.997]  You won't know because you already got killed!
[02:19:30.739 --> 02:19:34.162]  And then you look at somebody like me, who's nothing special.
[02:19:35.663 --> 02:19:36.544]  I'm a throwback.
[02:19:39.567 --> 02:19:41.168]  That's what one of my grandfathers called me.
[02:19:41.809 --> 02:19:42.630]  It wasn't an insult.
[02:19:44.445 --> 02:19:50.930]  But all the old men that could see me and how I behaved as a young person, like a man, they'd say, oh, this one, this is a good one.
[02:19:51.190 --> 02:19:52.271]  This is a throwback.
[02:19:52.792 --> 02:19:54.233]  It didn't mean it was throwing back.
[02:19:54.273 --> 02:19:55.974]  I was going to ride around on the backs of horses.
[02:19:57.355 --> 02:19:58.496]  It meant I was aggressive.
[02:19:59.177 --> 02:20:00.277]  I had a look in my eye.
[02:20:00.337 --> 02:20:01.298]  I wanted knowledge.
[02:20:01.558 --> 02:20:02.759]  I knew how to talk to men.
[02:20:03.060 --> 02:20:04.341]  I wanted responsibility.
[02:20:06.843 --> 02:20:08.604]  I was a man when I was 12 years old.
[02:20:09.244 --> 02:20:10.425]  Not Arrested Development at 30.
[02:20:12.312 --> 02:20:17.155]  Believe it, I could go join some political organization to become a man and have some right of passage.
[02:20:18.496 --> 02:20:20.297]  They've taken the rights of passage away.
[02:20:21.078 --> 02:20:22.318]  Thank God I had mine.
[02:20:22.659 --> 02:20:32.044]  Thank God my parents cut me loose and wouldn't call the police when I got beat up when I was a kid over a hundred times before I learned how to fight.
[02:20:33.025 --> 02:20:35.667]  And it wasn't because they were bad people, they were good people.
[02:20:36.948 --> 02:20:39.049]  And I haven't done that with my children and it makes me wonder.
[02:20:41.886 --> 02:20:50.828]  But the truth is, the world's too much of a dangerous place, and I have to give them mental prowess to understand the threats of the world, not physical, because that's how the fight of the future will be decided.
[02:20:51.008 --> 02:20:52.369]  And I've been a good father overall.
[02:20:53.349 --> 02:20:59.790]  But you've got to weigh the old ways with the new ways, and realize the new ways are to turn us into these jellyfish.
[02:21:00.831 --> 02:21:02.991]  Let's go ahead and go back to the beginning of LeeAnn McAdoo's report.
[02:21:03.011 --> 02:21:08.873]  I will not interrupt at this time, but just listen to the abject, viciously dangerous ignorance of these people.
[02:21:09.133 --> 02:21:09.833]  And I don't hate them.
[02:21:10.785 --> 02:21:23.755]  If I was out on a mesa, and there was a bunch of cows up on the top of it, and somebody fired a gun off and it hit one of them in the rear end and it started stampeding, I don't hate a thousand head of cattle running right at me.
[02:21:24.035 --> 02:21:25.716]  I don't have some personal thing against them.
[02:21:25.997 --> 02:21:30.180]  I don't get off intellectually in a sardonic way that I'm smarter than those cows.
[02:21:31.860 --> 02:21:33.581]  I see a thousand cows coming at me.
[02:21:33.621 --> 02:21:34.881]  I'm looking for a hole to get in.
[02:21:34.901 --> 02:21:36.002]  I'm looking for a tree to climb.
[02:21:36.322 --> 02:21:40.004]  I'm looking for a way to get out of their way before they run me over.
[02:21:40.204 --> 02:21:46.147]  Because a big pack of dumb people is as dangerous as it gets, and they'll stomp you into the ground.
[02:21:46.927 --> 02:21:51.269]  And they can be directed by the globalists to overrun everything we've ever built.
[02:21:54.050 --> 02:21:55.291]  They are a plague.
[02:21:56.731 --> 02:21:57.692]  Let's go to this clip.
[02:21:59.206 --> 02:22:02.268]  Do you think that Black Friday has a racist connotation?
[02:22:04.330 --> 02:22:04.790]  Not really.
[02:22:05.430 --> 02:22:06.191]  Honestly, yeah.
[02:22:06.491 --> 02:22:09.893]  Thinking about that, I never really thought about it in that way with racist connotations.
[02:22:10.594 --> 02:22:16.318]  I can see how it could be definitely offensive to people.
[02:22:16.438 --> 02:22:18.940]  I don't know where my opinion stands on it.
[02:22:19.220 --> 02:22:27.886]  As far as that goes... Sorry, I'm just gonna... I'm not familiar with the historical connotations of Black Friday.
[02:22:28.995 --> 02:22:31.936]  So, I'm not sure if that question even applies or not.
[02:22:31.976 --> 02:22:33.796]  Like, it could, it could not, but I just don't know.
[02:22:33.816 --> 02:22:37.157]  I don't even know what the beginning of Black... What is, like, the beginnings of Black Friday?
[02:22:37.197 --> 02:22:38.457]  What is, like, the origin of it?
[02:22:38.757 --> 02:22:48.679]  Well, no one really knows, but there are a lot of things that people are alleging, and it's kind of like a Black Lives Matter concern with this, that it had something to do with slavery.
[02:22:48.919 --> 02:22:49.600]  I said I wouldn't do it.
[02:22:49.640 --> 02:22:51.540]  Yes, Black Lives Matter is actually saying it's racist.
[02:22:51.560 --> 02:22:53.420]  So, I said go out and ask if it's racist.
[02:22:53.440 --> 02:22:55.321]  They did research, and sure enough, people are already saying it.
[02:22:56.281 --> 02:22:57.222]  Everyone keeps saying they don't know.
[02:22:57.702 --> 02:23:02.426]  It's just time for businesses to get in the black.
[02:23:02.526 --> 02:23:05.949]  And a lot of states do the thing where they don't have any taxes on that day.
[02:23:07.430 --> 02:23:09.872]  So it's about you getting in the black, them getting in the black.
[02:23:09.912 --> 02:23:10.913]  It's about prosperity.
[02:23:11.293 --> 02:23:13.175]  That's what Black Friday is!
[02:23:13.475 --> 02:23:14.356]  Let's go back to it.
[02:23:15.296 --> 02:23:22.222]  That they would sell their slaves at a discount in order to, you know, get the plantations filled with workers for the harsh winter.
[02:23:22.522 --> 02:23:24.384]  I think I did hear that before.
[02:23:25.248 --> 02:23:29.010]  But I mean, now they do it for discount items.
[02:23:29.390 --> 02:23:32.711]  Every year, these people kind of... Backing up again to that black guy.
[02:23:32.752 --> 02:23:34.012]  That's the smart person there.
[02:23:34.752 --> 02:23:41.075]  See, who cares if some slave owner started and built a university?
[02:23:41.095 --> 02:23:42.396]  You got a scholarship, you're going there.
[02:23:42.416 --> 02:23:43.677]  Who cares about freaking out about it?
[02:23:46.198 --> 02:23:48.479]  I mean, who cares if it was connected to racism?
[02:23:48.679 --> 02:23:50.560]  You get discounts on the day, at least, you see?
[02:23:51.587 --> 02:23:53.748]  So it's not racist, because it doesn't mean that anymore.
[02:23:54.028 --> 02:23:59.191]  It's like if I say, give me a faggot, 50 years ago in England, that meant a cigarette.
[02:24:00.052 --> 02:24:01.152]  They still call them that there.
[02:24:02.193 --> 02:24:04.114]  You say that here, somebody might want to punch you in the nose.
[02:24:04.434 --> 02:24:06.415]  A faggot just means a burning ember of wood.
[02:24:07.275 --> 02:24:09.036]  But see, people have taken over those words.
[02:24:09.317 --> 02:24:11.578]  They took the word gay, which meant a happy day.
[02:24:12.658 --> 02:24:13.739]  Caloo-calay.
[02:24:14.179 --> 02:24:15.240]  Frabjous day.
[02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:16.881]  It burbled as it went.
[02:24:18.081 --> 02:24:19.082]  And snoople snorped.
[02:24:20.128 --> 02:24:21.270]  What is that, the Jabberwocky?
[02:24:22.471 --> 02:24:24.574]  Anyways... And Burble, does it?
[02:24:25.856 --> 02:24:26.838]  Let's go back to the piece.
[02:24:26.858 --> 02:24:27.338]  Sorry, here it is.
[02:24:29.031 --> 02:24:32.813]  But I mean, now they do it for discount items.
[02:24:33.153 --> 02:24:37.436]  Every year, this people kind of, they get a little bit offended by it, and so we- Really?
[02:24:38.056 --> 02:24:38.296]  Really?
[02:24:38.316 --> 02:24:39.457]  I didn't even know that, dude.
[02:24:39.477 --> 02:24:41.818]  Okay, the problem is, who is being offended?
[02:24:41.878 --> 02:24:45.000]  Like, is it like, the non-black community, or is it the black community?
[02:24:45.020 --> 02:24:51.103]  Because if the black community is offended, then I would be more for changing it than if, like, someone who wasn't black was offended.
[02:24:51.123 --> 02:24:51.203]  Oh.
[02:24:51.363 --> 02:24:55.546]  You know, because they're the only ones who get to decide whether or not something has offensive connotations to them.
[02:24:55.826 --> 02:24:56.066]  Good pause.
[02:24:56.586 --> 02:24:59.629]  Do you hear the level of idiocy here, this weird twisted logic?
[02:25:00.330 --> 02:25:04.293]  Well, if the black community is offended, well, who speaks for the black community?
[02:25:05.555 --> 02:25:09.859]  It'd be like saying the white community, you know how many different views there are of white people and black people?
[02:25:11.500 --> 02:25:13.262]  It's just, it's just this collectivist view.
[02:25:13.562 --> 02:25:17.886]  Oh, the black mouth will tell us what we do.
[02:25:19.548 --> 02:25:21.910]  But if someone else is offended, well, then it doesn't matter.
[02:25:24.002 --> 02:25:25.122]  Well, let me tell you who came up with this.
[02:25:25.142 --> 02:25:27.163]  A bunch of white people to jack with everybody.
[02:25:27.403 --> 02:25:29.004]  Because they wanted to exterminate all the blacks.
[02:25:29.044 --> 02:25:31.484]  They had to buy them off, get control of them, get them on welfare.
[02:25:31.725 --> 02:25:32.765]  It's all been declassified.
[02:25:32.805 --> 02:25:33.465]  It's all admitted.
[02:25:33.505 --> 02:25:36.566]  Margaret Sanger, all nine yards, can read thousands of pages of white papers.
[02:25:36.886 --> 02:25:41.528]  Just go to the Colgate Foundation, others read the Procter & Gamble stuff, all of it.
[02:25:43.328 --> 02:25:43.969]  And they've done a job.
[02:25:43.989 --> 02:25:46.249]  You can sit there and go, half the black people are aborted.
[02:25:46.609 --> 02:25:47.110]  I don't care!
[02:25:47.170 --> 02:25:47.770]  Shut up, white!
[02:25:50.091 --> 02:25:51.071]  I saw a poop swastika!
[02:25:52.202 --> 02:25:53.604]  I'm like, okay, but there's a whole plan to kill everybody.
[02:25:53.644 --> 02:25:55.525]  Let's just... Shut up!
[02:25:55.626 --> 02:25:56.466]  I don't care about that!
[02:25:56.947 --> 02:25:58.569]  Rachel Maddow didn't say a word about that!
[02:25:59.510 --> 02:26:01.171]  Reverend Sharpton didn't say a word about that!
[02:26:01.191 --> 02:26:07.077]  Well, fluoride... Shut up!
[02:26:08.178 --> 02:26:11.682]  There's no black lobby out there worried about fluoride or vaccines or anything, no!
[02:26:12.723 --> 02:26:15.206]  The NAACP is there to keep black people on the plantation!
[02:26:16.288 --> 02:26:18.290]  Does that mean every member of the NAACP is a bad guy?
[02:26:18.691 --> 02:26:18.911]  No!
[02:26:19.292 --> 02:26:21.374]  They don't know what's going on like everybody else.
[02:26:21.955 --> 02:26:23.216]  Everybody's being targeted.
[02:26:23.597 --> 02:26:24.858]  Everybody's getting screwed over.
[02:26:24.878 --> 02:26:27.942]  Alright, I gotta stop.
[02:26:28.002 --> 02:26:28.803]  I said I would interrupt it.
[02:26:28.823 --> 02:26:29.584]  It's just too incredible.
[02:26:29.604 --> 02:26:30.284]  Let's go back to the piece.
[02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:33.181]  Okay, the problem is who is being offended?
[02:26:33.421 --> 02:26:36.402]  Is it the non-black community or the black community?
[02:26:36.422 --> 02:26:42.424]  Because if the black community is offended, then I would be more for changing it than if someone who wasn't black was offended.
[02:26:42.725 --> 02:26:46.906]  You know, because they're the only ones who get to decide whether or not something has offensive connotations to them.
[02:26:47.166 --> 02:26:50.168]  Because they're the community that has lived through the historical implications.
[02:26:50.408 --> 02:26:53.089]  Do you think we should rename Black Friday?
[02:26:53.109 --> 02:26:56.710]  She was talking to her smartphone.
[02:26:56.930 --> 02:26:57.170]  No.
[02:26:58.031 --> 02:26:58.591]  Why is that?
[02:27:00.245 --> 02:27:01.365]  Have you checked your privilege?
[02:27:03.126 --> 02:27:06.946]  Well, actually, I'm gonna reverse that statement now that I actually thought it through.
[02:27:07.166 --> 02:27:08.847]  I can see where racism would come up.
[02:27:09.127 --> 02:27:10.467]  There should definitely be a new name for it.
[02:27:10.947 --> 02:27:14.168]  Um... I'm not sure, but... Any ideas?
[02:27:14.468 --> 02:27:22.070]  Something that would be more color neutral, or... I mean, I wouldn't go color then, since that's still, like, race implied, I guess.
[02:27:22.410 --> 02:27:27.451]  No, if people agree with that opinion, then yeah, of course, it's... It's not right, but what would they change it to?
[02:27:27.471 --> 02:27:28.531]  Do you have any ideas?
[02:27:29.761 --> 02:27:31.082]  African American Friday.
[02:27:31.102 --> 02:27:31.182]  Okay.
[02:27:32.762 --> 02:27:33.563]  That's a good potential.
[02:27:33.703 --> 02:27:35.483]  You gotta have something that has a ring to it.
[02:27:35.763 --> 02:27:37.144]  Yeah, that's the thing.
[02:27:37.184 --> 02:27:39.345]  You can't think of anything that has a ring to it.
[02:27:39.465 --> 02:27:40.725]  At least they didn't use the n-word.
[02:27:41.846 --> 02:27:43.847]  The annual Walmart brawl.
[02:27:44.787 --> 02:27:45.267]  How about that?
[02:27:55.298 --> 02:27:57.159]  I mean, why would anybody go?
[02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:00.381]  It sounds like an awful way to spend a day.
[02:28:23.134 --> 02:28:23.594]  Exactly.
[02:28:23.614 --> 02:28:23.954]  Beat up.
[02:28:24.374 --> 02:28:28.676]  Maybe they call it Black Friday because you have to be like a black belt in karate to, you know.
[02:28:28.836 --> 02:28:29.477]  That could be it.
[02:28:29.537 --> 02:28:30.377]  Discount day.
[02:28:31.317 --> 02:28:33.118]  Don't kill each other day, please.
[02:28:34.498 --> 02:28:35.679]  That's not for me to decide.
[02:28:35.719 --> 02:28:39.821]  That's for the community to decide what is and isn't offensive to them and what's in a suitable location.
[02:28:39.841 --> 02:28:40.761]  Oh, she can't decide.
[02:28:40.781 --> 02:28:41.401]  Racist or not racist?
[02:28:41.421 --> 02:28:42.041]  It's the community.
[02:28:42.422 --> 02:28:43.062]  Not racist.
[02:28:45.427 --> 02:28:54.913]  I think people would have to speak up, and if people were to say something, if it was something that was heard by the population, I think people would sympathize with it if it was something that they felt was racist.
[02:28:56.121 --> 02:29:10.173]  So even if it's not necessarily true, though, I see a lot on college campuses right now, a lot of things are happening because of the way people feel, because they're offended, because it upsets them the way they feel, even though it might not necessarily be truth or no evidence to it.
[02:29:10.373 --> 02:29:21.262]  If someone is generally to find something offensive, then we should find the best way to accommodate everyone, and the way that we act with each other, and the way that we speak, because they go kind of hand in hand, I think.
[02:29:22.223 --> 02:29:25.585]  So yeah, if they want something to change, then I think it's for the better.
[02:29:25.865 --> 02:29:27.526]  If it makes people feel better, go for it.
[02:29:27.546 --> 02:29:29.548]  Do you think this is a smart direction we're going in?
[02:29:29.568 --> 02:29:31.929]  Hopefully it is a smart direction.
[02:29:31.989 --> 02:29:33.050]  Feelings over facts?
[02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:38.353]  Well, we should do facts over feelings first, and I hope it is a fact, because we're in ecology.
[02:29:38.373 --> 02:29:44.997]  If they don't know what they're talking about, then... Lower prices and don't kill each other.
[02:29:45.717 --> 02:29:46.618]  Everything must go.
[02:29:46.758 --> 02:29:48.219]  As long as it's racist!
[02:29:50.254 --> 02:29:51.797]  All right, that's Lee Ann McAdoo's report.
[02:29:51.857 --> 02:29:56.444]  The unedited video, without me interrupting, will be up on InfoWars.com.
[02:29:56.464 --> 02:29:57.485]  So will this version as well.
[02:29:57.506 --> 02:29:57.866]  Stay with us.
[02:29:57.886 --> 02:29:58.507]  More news straight ahead.
[02:29:58.627 --> 02:29:59.509]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.009 --> 02:30:01.612]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.553 --> 02:30:05.238]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.727 --> 02:30:10.308]  The D.C.
[02:30:10.368 --> 02:30:14.852]  Police Chief urges citizens to fight back against Paris-style attackers.
[02:30:15.372 --> 02:30:18.675]  Speaking with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Washington, D.C.
[02:30:18.715 --> 02:30:28.644]  Police Chief Kathy Lanier urged residents to do what's necessary to save lives in the event of a terror attack or mass shooting, whether it means run, hide, or fight.
[02:30:29.004 --> 02:30:35.750]  If you're in a position to try to take the gunman out, it's the best option for saving lives before police can get there, Lanier said.
[02:30:35.970 --> 02:30:48.204]  While acknowledging her latest suggestion was counterintuitive to previous tactics the police have advised, Lanier claimed that taking action may be essential to prevent another massacre like the attack in Paris, which left over 120 people dead.
[02:30:55.712 --> 02:30:59.879]  We've never told people take action, but it's a different scenario.
[02:31:00.119 --> 02:31:08.452]  Keep up with our latest news and information on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[02:31:09.597 --> 02:31:12.559]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[02:33:19.867 --> 02:33:22.068]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:33:22.528 --> 02:33:23.829]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:24.389 --> 02:33:27.770]  It's the time of the season.
[02:33:29.991 --> 02:33:31.852]  When love runs high.
[02:33:32.672 --> 02:33:36.073]  In this time, give it to me easy.
[02:33:38.114 --> 02:33:43.976]  And let me try with pleasured hands to take you in the sun.
[02:33:50.771 --> 02:33:57.973]  Now we have the fourth hour coming up with Jakari Jackson hosting today and he has got a bunch of special reports he's going to be premiering.
[02:33:58.414 --> 02:34:03.255]  He's in there getting a ton of breaking news analysis that he's going to be going over.
[02:34:03.415 --> 02:34:10.858]  So a big rundown in the fourth hour today with InfoWars Nightly News Anchor hosting the radio side of things, Jakari Jackson.
[02:34:13.012 --> 02:34:22.675]  We're going to be going to our guest here in just a moment, Norm Singleton, who heads up Campaign for Liberty and was Ron Paul's legislative director for a long time.
[02:34:23.696 --> 02:34:27.557]  They are quarterbacking, my favorite word, a move to continue to audit the Fed.
[02:34:27.577 --> 02:34:28.757]  They've gotten very close to it.
[02:34:28.777 --> 02:34:33.419]  So we're going to be talking to him here in just a minute.
[02:34:34.119 --> 02:34:36.080]  First off, we just talked about Black Friday.
[02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:42.462]  Again, you can go to USA Today, Wall Street Journal, Consumer Reports and get different views on it, but it's all pretty much the same.
[02:34:45.273 --> 02:34:53.942]  The best time of the year to buy products is cyclically after big holidays and when it's a slow time of the year.
[02:34:55.143 --> 02:34:56.324]  That could be the middle of the summer.
[02:34:56.344 --> 02:34:58.126]  It could be in the spring.
[02:34:58.186 --> 02:34:59.227]  It depends on what you're buying.
[02:35:01.029 --> 02:35:07.255]  If you're buying gardening furniture or garden furniture or pool furniture, you want to buy it in the winter.
[02:35:07.275 --> 02:35:09.077]  If you're buying a boat,
[02:35:10.282 --> 02:35:16.549]  It was like 15 years ago I bought a modest fishing ski boat and I bought it the winter and people couldn't believe the price I got.
[02:35:16.569 --> 02:35:20.213]  I mean, I got like quarter off on it because I bought it the winter.
[02:35:20.694 --> 02:35:21.775]  Talked to a guy who bought the same thing.
[02:35:21.795 --> 02:35:23.197]  It was a lot more as he bought it in the summer.
[02:35:24.278 --> 02:35:25.759]  Houses cost more in the summer.
[02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:27.662]  People just sell more houses in the summer.
[02:35:27.982 --> 02:35:29.504]  Prices go up for homes in the summer.
[02:35:32.222 --> 02:35:36.003]  But bottom line, Black Friday is not one of the best times to go out and buy.
[02:35:36.043 --> 02:35:44.845]  And folks like Walmart and others have been caught jacking up prices the week before, then lowering them the week of, but it's still just the regular price.
[02:35:45.325 --> 02:35:54.988]  When we have sales at InfoWarsStore.com, or the nutraceutical site InfoWarsLife.com, I mean, when it says 25% off on the new Deep Cleanse,
[02:35:56.049 --> 02:35:58.550]  The product is so popular, that's 25% off.
[02:35:59.250 --> 02:36:03.291]  When we say 30% off RainForce, that's already off the discounted price.
[02:36:03.471 --> 02:36:04.651]  33% off DNAForce.
[02:36:07.072 --> 02:36:12.253]  It's all available at InfoWarsLife.com through next Monday, right through Black Friday weekend.
[02:36:12.273 --> 02:36:14.293]  Your purchase helps fund this operation.
[02:36:14.794 --> 02:36:20.235]  And of course, our free market hope is we'll sell even more because it's priced so good that we won't lose money.
[02:36:21.206 --> 02:36:24.347]  Because the goal is to fund this operation and give you really high quality products.
[02:36:24.748 --> 02:36:28.869]  Survival Shield X2, Super Melon Female Vitality, all of it really amazing.
[02:36:29.169 --> 02:36:32.031]  Read the five-star reviews, check out the informational videos.
[02:36:32.811 --> 02:36:40.775]  But whether it's water filtration systems like the Alexa Pure Pro, or the Pro Pure G2, or storable foods, it's all free shipping.
[02:36:42.936 --> 02:36:45.997]  And free shipping on storable foods is a big deal, obviously, because it's heavy.
[02:36:47.222 --> 02:36:49.364]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[02:36:49.824 --> 02:36:52.867]  So free shipping and big discounts across the board.
[02:36:52.887 --> 02:37:01.394]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:01.874 --> 02:37:04.897]  Now, continuing in the fight.
[02:37:05.997 --> 02:37:09.841]  At the top of the pyramid controlling this country is the private run for profit
[02:37:10.871 --> 02:37:12.492]  Quasi-governmental Federal Reserve.
[02:37:13.012 --> 02:37:14.393]  It has quasi-governmental powers.
[02:37:14.933 --> 02:37:22.616]  And we have famous clips, we gotta cue that up, of Greenspan saying on the Lair News Hour that Congress has no authority over the Fed.
[02:37:22.636 --> 02:37:24.737]  It's independent, fourth branch of government.
[02:37:25.817 --> 02:37:27.238]  It's three branches, folks, not the Fed.
[02:37:27.258 --> 02:37:29.619]  1913, same year we got the income tax.
[02:37:29.919 --> 02:37:30.559]  No mistake there.
[02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:39.083]  And Ron Paul went from being in Congress back in 96 and getting no co-sponsors to passing it in the House, going to the Senate.
[02:37:40.529 --> 02:37:43.972]  Or people like Bernie Sanders, who claimed he was for it, killed it.
[02:37:44.813 --> 02:37:45.614]  Never forget that.
[02:37:45.654 --> 02:37:46.875]  He claims he's against the big banks.
[02:37:47.075 --> 02:37:47.755]  He's full of it.
[02:37:49.057 --> 02:37:50.998]  Got Brad Pitt out talking about the big banks.
[02:37:51.499 --> 02:37:52.119]  Yeah, sure.
[02:37:53.180 --> 02:37:55.683]  Every time they do that, they pass regulations shutting down local banks.
[02:37:56.843 --> 02:38:01.624]  Norm Singleton worked for Congressman Ron Paul from 1997 to 2012.
[02:38:02.024 --> 02:38:06.245]  He served as legislative aide on education and workforce issues for Congressman Paul.
[02:38:06.825 --> 02:38:11.226]  When he became Congressman Paul's legislative director, a position he held until Congressman Paul left Congress.
[02:38:11.646 --> 02:38:16.507]  Mr. Singleton also served as volunteer policy director for the Ron Paul 2012 presidential campaign.
[02:38:16.827 --> 02:38:21.008]  Prior to working for Ron Paul, Mr. Singleton worked for the National Right to Work Committee.
[02:38:21.288 --> 02:38:21.768]  Mr. Singleton
[02:38:22.068 --> 02:38:23.409]  Well, that's up to you, folks!
[02:38:44.130 --> 02:38:46.651]  You notice we got rid of Boehner, didn't we?
[02:38:47.891 --> 02:38:49.211]  Two steps forward, one step back.
[02:38:49.271 --> 02:38:50.492]  It's better than two steps back.
[02:38:50.892 --> 02:38:54.793]  So we're moving forward thanks to you, and that's why Norm Singleton's here.
[02:38:55.093 --> 02:38:56.914]  First off, hope you have a great Thanksgiving, sir.
[02:38:56.954 --> 02:39:00.535]  I want to commend you for all your stalwart effort in the fight for liberty.
[02:39:01.035 --> 02:39:04.976]  Tell us about the current battle lines to try to get rid of the private central bank.
[02:39:06.448 --> 02:39:10.750]  Thank you, sir, and happy Thanksgiving to you and happy Thanksgiving to all of your listeners.
[02:39:11.330 --> 02:39:14.012]  It's a real pleasure to be on the show.
[02:39:15.072 --> 02:39:25.297]  Several weeks ago, Senator Rand Paul introduced a new version of Audit the Fed, and he used a little Senate procedure called Rule 14 where he
[02:39:27.006 --> 02:39:40.977]  Senator can get up and object to the third reading of the bill and have it placed directly on the Senate calendar, which means that at any given time, and we understand it's going to be sometime in the next two to three weeks, the Senate can be forced to vote on it.
[02:39:41.418 --> 02:39:52.567]  The reason Senator Paul did this is because the Audit the Fed bill has been tied up in committee and there are a couple of Fed apologists on the banking committee
[02:39:53.708 --> 02:39:55.089]  Real strong Fed apologist.
[02:39:55.769 --> 02:40:00.612]  Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee has been an opponent of Audit the Fed.
[02:40:00.652 --> 02:40:01.552]  He's on the committee.
[02:40:02.193 --> 02:40:20.222]  And Elizabeth Warren, who is another one who likes Senator Sanders, claims to be for transparency, claims to be an opponent of crony capitalism and the big banks, yet she opposes opening the books of the really facilitator of crony capitalism, which is Audit the Fed.
[02:40:20.362 --> 02:40:20.622]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:20.742 --> 02:40:28.548]  Which is why, and so Campaign for Liberty is right now doing an effort to collect as many petitions as possible.
[02:40:28.588 --> 02:40:30.610]  We've already sent in over 70,000.
[02:40:30.970 --> 02:40:32.011]  We're trying to get more.
[02:40:32.071 --> 02:40:42.459]  You can go to our website, campaignforliberty.org, and in the spirit of the season, people can enter and win an AR-15.
[02:40:44.161 --> 02:40:48.644]  Anyone who signs a petition will be automatically entered into the drawing for a great AR-15.
[02:40:51.514 --> 02:41:03.398]  You can, this would make a great Christmas present to give to someone who is desiring of a firearm.
[02:41:03.438 --> 02:41:10.060]  You can maybe win a gun and help Campaign for Liberty's efforts to pass out at the Fed.
[02:41:10.460 --> 02:41:16.662]  So that is really a win-win for everybody who values individual liberty and limited government.
[02:41:17.242 --> 02:41:23.247]  Well, that only makes it that much better as it promotes the Second Amendment and also, you know, puts a stick in the eye of the victim disarmament folks.
[02:41:23.267 --> 02:41:28.492]  But, you know, I can play the MSNBC clips, too, and CNBC, where they admit we're all ruled by central banks.
[02:41:28.512 --> 02:41:31.054]  They now appoint the leaders of Europe, basically.
[02:41:31.394 --> 02:41:32.996]  I mean, it just gets crazier and crazier.
[02:41:33.596 --> 02:41:37.680]  But since we're pushing for this again, you probably should, since you've been there since the beginning, sir.
[02:41:38.620 --> 02:41:49.468]  Maybe chronicle the saga where we've come from nowhere to the one yard line in sudden death overtime with 30 seconds on the clock because things are getting close to collapsing.
[02:41:50.069 --> 02:41:51.930]  But we're very close to getting this audit.
[02:41:52.291 --> 02:42:00.717]  I mean, what an idea that we actually audit this private run-for-profit institution that admittedly has given trillions to offshore banks of U.S.
[02:42:00.737 --> 02:42:02.158]  taxpayer-backed money.
[02:42:02.178 --> 02:42:03.159]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[02:42:04.320 --> 02:42:04.540]  Right.
[02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:05.200]  This started
[02:42:08.041 --> 02:42:20.972]  During the, well, back in the, of course, Congressman Paul was first inspired to run when Nixon closed the gold standard and he saw the dangers of our moving to a completely Fed-dominated fiat currency system.
[02:42:21.693 --> 02:42:31.521]  And throughout the 70s and 80s, he has been a voice for real monetary reform, for Federal Reserve transparency, and then for
[02:42:32.708 --> 02:42:36.890]  As a stepping stone to transforming back to market-driven currencies.
[02:42:37.670 --> 02:42:46.575]  And for years, though, in the House of Representatives, he was the only one who would bring these issues up at Fed hearings.
[02:42:46.955 --> 02:42:51.777]  He would challenge Greenspan and Bernanke, and he was kind of dismissed, kind of laughed at.
[02:42:52.257 --> 02:42:55.199]  And then two things happened in 07 and 08.
[02:42:55.439 --> 02:42:57.320]  One, which I know you
[02:42:58.650 --> 02:43:01.752]  Everybody in your audience, I know, remembers both of these events.
[02:43:01.913 --> 02:43:18.625]  One was his tremendous run for the presidency and that, of course, really shocked a lot of people, including a lot of us on Dr. Paul's staff and in his inner circle, when we saw him talking to college students and they were chanting, End the Fed.
[02:43:18.985 --> 02:43:23.709]  They were waving copies of books by Murray Rothbard and Ludwig von Mises and F.I.
[02:43:23.749 --> 02:43:24.089]  Hayek.
[02:43:25.218 --> 02:43:41.431]  And it just turned out to be just this tremendous grassroots movement that cut on, that was just waiting for someone like Ron Paul to emerge on the national scene and talk about and tell the truth about our monetary policy, our foreign policy, our deficits.
[02:43:42.131 --> 02:43:50.998]  And then, right after that, there was the Great Meltdown, the Great Housing Crash, the Great Explosion of the Bubble, followed by the Big Bailouts.
[02:43:51.658 --> 02:43:52.299]  And that
[02:43:53.115 --> 02:43:58.180]  was what really proved to a lot of people that Ron Paul was right.
[02:43:58.300 --> 02:44:05.887]  In fact, I remember being in the Congressional office in those days, and there was a lot of mainstream journalists who wanted to talk to Dr. Paul.
[02:44:05.927 --> 02:44:12.734]  And the tenor of the interviews was, well, we laughed at you six months ago when you told us this was going to happen, but it turns out you were right.
[02:44:12.814 --> 02:44:15.336]  So what did you see that the rest of us didn't see?
[02:44:15.376 --> 02:44:18.239]  And of course, they didn't like Dr. Paul's answers.
[02:44:19.460 --> 02:44:26.524]  But out of that campaign, he founded Campaign for Liberty, and since day one, Campaign for Liberty's signature issue has been to audit the Fed.
[02:44:27.044 --> 02:44:28.485]  It's passed the House twice.
[02:44:28.985 --> 02:44:34.308]  Unfortunately, we were never able to get it through the Senate, which is why this Senate vote is a big deal.
[02:44:35.126 --> 02:44:44.855]  Because if we get it, even if there's a vote on the Senate, at least you'll do what politicians really hate, which is be on record on an issue that might alienate a power group.
[02:44:44.875 --> 02:45:01.409]  Sure, we've gone from nowhere to almost winning, and so we need to really push hard now, because as things get more and more out of control with the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve System and its sister outfits in Europe, we need them to get the discrediting that is their due, obviously.
[02:45:02.531 --> 02:45:07.019]  For folks that don't keep track of this, let me just give people a minute or two of synopsis and I want to see if you concur with it.
[02:45:07.720 --> 02:45:13.551]  Ron Paul and what you and his supporters and I and countless others were able to do was actually
[02:45:14.719 --> 02:45:29.749]  Fill the vacuum because of controlled Republican and Democratic groups that existed with something that was pro-America, pro-freedom, pro-free market, anti-crony capitalist, starting when Ron Paul first ran for president 10 years ago or so, or longer.
[02:45:29.769 --> 02:45:33.972]  Of course, he ran before that back in the late 80s.
[02:45:37.051 --> 02:45:58.039]  Now we're at this point where we've gotten a lot of good Tea Party people elected that are more campaign for liberty style and who aren't the Republican fake counterfeit Tea Party and that's the main enemy of the Republican and Democratic leadership and they admit they're scared of the libertarian patriot move to unseat them.
[02:45:58.099 --> 02:46:02.901]  So the real opposition is state governments, local governments, and federally
[02:46:03.641 --> 02:46:15.585]  The Campaign for Liberty coalition, and that's why you get Rand Paul demonized, why they ignore him, why they attack him, why they do all of that, is because they know he's another representation of that.
[02:46:16.206 --> 02:46:27.210]  And so that's why it's so important for people to be involved in the Campaign for Liberty, to be involved with Rand Paul's campaign, to be involved because win, lose, or draw, we're injecting the real issues.
[02:46:27.910 --> 02:46:29.271]  That, hey, government's too big.
[02:46:29.311 --> 02:46:30.511]  Hey, we've devalued the dollar.
[02:46:30.531 --> 02:46:33.432]  Hey, we can't take from the next generation to give to ourselves.
[02:46:34.393 --> 02:46:37.614]  But now, we've been hearing, hey, the next generation for 30, 40 years.
[02:46:37.714 --> 02:46:38.454]  We're now here.
[02:46:38.875 --> 02:46:55.942]  We're about to pay the comeuppance, and you're a smart guy, and talking to a lot of other smart people, Norm Singleton of CampaignForLiberty.org, what do you think, I mean, A, about what I just said, is that true, but B, about how serious this global financial meltdown really is?
[02:46:57.119 --> 02:47:00.021]  I think that your analysis is spot on.
[02:47:00.781 --> 02:47:06.865]  The Republican establishment, they do not like the Tea Party group.
[02:47:06.905 --> 02:47:08.726]  They certainly don't like the Liberty Movement.
[02:47:09.246 --> 02:47:26.276]  I was on the floor of Tampa in 2012 when they did the rules change and Speaker Boehner read from the teleprompter, I know you remember this Alex, read from the teleprompter that the ayes have it and it was clear if you were on the floor that was debatable to say the least.
[02:47:27.077 --> 02:47:40.328]  And the reason that Audit the Fed has become an issue that most Republicans actually support is because of Campaign for Liberty's mobilization of all those Americans that were woken up by Dr. Paul to put pressure on Congress.
[02:47:40.748 --> 02:47:46.193]  And that's why it is important that people go to campaignforliberty.org, check us out, check out our
[02:47:47.458 --> 02:47:47.798]  All right.
[02:48:18.518 --> 02:48:24.961]  On the financial collapse, I think that there's a lot of reason to be worried about the global economy.
[02:48:25.001 --> 02:48:35.705]  When you look at Greece, when you look at the reports coming out about the Fed and how the Fed keeps saying, oh, an interest rate hike is just around the corner, but not now, and they always find an excuse.
[02:48:35.745 --> 02:48:41.367]  And I will bet that they will use the global instability and the panic of ISIS
[02:48:42.287 --> 02:49:07.899]  To say next month we're going to have to delay our rate increase because right now with the fear in the markets just like they used 9-11 after 9-11 that's when Greenspan really again pumped up the money creation to do that but we really won't know what their evaluation of the situation is and what deals they may or may not have made with say Greece or the EU to bail them out to bail out
[02:49:09.365 --> 02:49:19.835]  Wall Street firms in the event that this thing really that we do experience another 08 or worse until we pass the audit bill and Unfortunate and there was a story yesterday.
[02:49:19.955 --> 02:49:33.468]  It's it's up on our blog about how the Fed leaks Sometimes confidential information to certain investors as a way of testing how their policies will be received by the marketplace Yeah, that's a nice way of saying insider trading
[02:49:34.008 --> 02:49:34.989]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:49:35.310 --> 02:49:37.513]  If you or I did that, we'd go to jail.
[02:49:38.394 --> 02:49:41.177]  That wasn't what Martha Stewart went to jail for.
[02:49:41.237 --> 02:49:44.722]  She went to jail for allegedly lying to the Fed.
[02:49:46.405 --> 02:49:49.788]  But this is just outrageous, and this is why we need to open the books.
[02:49:49.808 --> 02:49:51.249]  Totally rigged economy.
[02:49:51.429 --> 02:49:52.370]  Totally rigged economy.
[02:49:52.410 --> 02:49:54.952]  I want to go out to break into one more segment with you on this.
[02:49:55.252 --> 02:50:04.399]  Here is Alan Greenspan, six, seven years ago, on Laird NewsHour, after he left the Fed, and Bernanke taking over, saying that they're above the law and Congress cannot audit them.
[02:50:04.440 --> 02:50:04.700]  Here it is.
[02:50:06.007 --> 02:50:13.414]  I have the ideology because I believe that it is the best way of coming at the world and what type of policy.
[02:50:13.974 --> 02:50:21.762]  What is the proper relationship, what should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[02:50:23.359 --> 02:50:37.109]  Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means basically that there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[02:50:38.528 --> 02:50:56.840]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[02:50:57.901 --> 02:50:58.982]  What a stunning statement.
[02:50:59.002 --> 02:50:59.742]  We're going to break.
[02:51:00.243 --> 02:51:01.083]  We're above the law.
[02:51:01.724 --> 02:51:03.545]  Everything's fine as long as we do whatever we want.
[02:51:04.338 --> 02:51:08.635]  We're government and no other government can get in our way, but they're private owned by Europeans.
[02:51:10.302 --> 02:51:11.082]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:51:11.102 --> 02:51:12.602]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?

[02:52:10.603 --> 02:52:14.344]  Thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day.

[02:52:18.605 --> 02:52:23.786]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.

[02:53:38.720 --> 02:53:41.481]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[02:53:41.781 --> 02:53:44.401]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[02:53:44.421 --> 02:53:44.841]  Croix River.
[02:53:45.162 --> 02:53:47.162]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[02:53:47.382 --> 02:53:50.103]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[02:53:50.343 --> 02:53:50.863]  His excuse?
[02:53:51.223 --> 02:53:52.303]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[02:53:52.563 --> 02:53:53.844]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[02:53:54.164 --> 02:53:59.665]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[02:53:59.925 --> 02:54:00.665]  Don't wait.
[02:54:00.965 --> 02:54:03.346]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now.
[02:54:03.626 --> 02:54:05.846]  For not just your sake, but for the sake of your loved ones.
[02:54:06.126 --> 02:54:07.707]  Again, that's LibertyOnCall.org.
[02:54:14.477 --> 02:54:35.488]  It's outrageous that our government's openly arming ISIS and Turkey's shooting down Russian aircraft and blowing up rescue helicopters inside Syria.
[02:54:35.508 --> 02:54:38.890]  But it's even more outrageous that we, for 101 years,
[02:54:42.205 --> 02:54:43.206]  It ought to be 102 years.
[02:54:43.226 --> 02:54:48.430]  I've had a private secret banking consortium that calls itself the Fed.
[02:54:48.450 --> 02:54:52.574]  Imagine if I showed up at your house in a uniform and I said, I'm the Fed!
[02:54:52.594 --> 02:54:54.435]  I'm gonna run your life now!
[02:54:54.455 --> 02:54:56.557]  And I go, no you're not.
[02:54:56.957 --> 02:54:57.518]  Yes I am!
[02:54:57.658 --> 02:54:58.279]  I'm the Fed!
[02:54:58.639 --> 02:55:00.040]  Look, my name is Fed!
[02:55:01.101 --> 02:55:05.545]  Like Federal Express or Federal Cleaners or Federal Ammunition.
[02:55:05.625 --> 02:55:07.927]  It's just so ridiculous.
[02:55:09.195 --> 02:55:23.546]  And then it just gives trillions to insiders at 0% interest, gives trillions in raw money to others, won't tell us who, and then Bernie Sanders is the champion of fighting it with Elizabeth Warren and they protect it.
[02:55:24.067 --> 02:55:30.251]  Then I gotta have stupid, so-called liberals on the street go, oh you don't like Bernie Sanders, thought you don't like the Federal Reserve.
[02:55:30.532 --> 02:55:33.594]  I get emails like that too and I go, actually Bernie Sanders protected it.
[02:55:33.754 --> 02:55:34.535]  No they didn't!
[02:55:36.377 --> 02:55:37.578]  Why aren't you for Elizabeth Warren?
[02:55:37.598 --> 02:55:38.439]  Because she's a woman?
[02:55:39.259 --> 02:55:44.884]  It's just more of the same ignorance that just makes my blood boil.
[02:55:45.624 --> 02:55:48.487]  Rand Paul exposed that they were Al Qaeda's air force.
[02:55:48.807 --> 02:55:50.208]  Rand Paul exposed ISIS.
[02:55:50.568 --> 02:55:51.669]  Ted Cruz jumped on board.
[02:55:51.709 --> 02:55:51.970]  Great.
[02:55:53.591 --> 02:55:55.192]  Now you're hearing some of that from Donald Trump.
[02:55:55.212 --> 02:55:55.753]  That's good.
[02:55:57.574 --> 02:56:04.199]  But regardless of where all this goes, it is political ignorance of the population
[02:56:05.029 --> 02:56:05.750]  that allows this.
[02:56:05.790 --> 02:56:08.592]  It is the ocean in which these frauds swim.
[02:56:08.952 --> 02:56:14.036]  Closing comments from Norm Singleton, one of the brains behind Campaign for Liberty and Ron Paul's success.
[02:56:15.017 --> 02:56:17.459]  In the last few minutes, what is your prognosis?
[02:56:17.499 --> 02:56:20.182]  You feeling good about the future, bad, or a mix of both?
[02:56:21.523 --> 02:56:22.363]  A mix of both.
[02:56:22.904 --> 02:56:25.086]  I think that as the
[02:56:26.061 --> 02:56:31.369]  You know, as Dr. Paul likes to say, politicians are a lagging indicator on issues.
[02:56:32.210 --> 02:56:41.765]  There's a growing movement to change monetary policy and again, Campaign for Liberty, campaignforliberty.org is leading the charge on that.
[02:56:43.353 --> 02:56:55.447]  And I think that people, as more people wake up, as more people learn the truth, as Campaign for Liberty and the rest of the liberty movement grows, I think we could actually change some things.
[02:56:55.547 --> 02:56:59.111]  Hopefully we'll do it before there's a major crash.
[02:57:00.816 --> 02:57:27.558]  And so I would just encourage everyone to go to CampaignForLiberty.org, sign our petition, enter to win a free AR-15, and I would also wish, again, wish you and all your listeners a very happy Thanksgiving, and those people who are flying, my thoughts and prayers go with you as you endure what I'm sure is to be, given recent events, an even worse abuse of our basic human dignity by the
[02:57:28.699 --> 02:57:37.844]  So-called Transportation Security Administration or Gropers for Hire, which is something which of course is something else Campaign for Liberty is working on.
[02:57:38.204 --> 02:57:39.404]  Get rid of the TSA.
[02:57:40.445 --> 02:57:42.546]  Truly privatize airport security.
[02:57:43.326 --> 02:57:44.207]  We shouldn't be true.
[02:57:44.227 --> 02:57:48.489]  We shouldn't sacrifice our Fourth Amendment rights and our dignity just to fly on an airplane.
[02:57:48.809 --> 02:57:49.349]  Well said.
[02:57:49.369 --> 02:57:51.950]  Have a great Thanksgiving and hopefully join us more Norm.
[02:57:52.150 --> 02:57:52.711]  Thank you so much.
[02:57:53.581 --> 02:57:53.961]  Thank you.
[02:57:54.262 --> 02:57:58.785]  Norm Singleton on the brain masterminds behind Campaign for Liberty.
[02:57:58.805 --> 02:57:59.986]  They've just done incredible work.
[02:58:01.927 --> 02:58:06.811]  By the way, you know they flew in 150-something illegals out of Mexico and just dumped them off at JFK.
[02:58:08.252 --> 02:58:10.493]  That was mainstream news, CBS News.
[02:58:12.835 --> 02:58:16.718]  Oh, bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees, millions into Europe.
[02:58:16.818 --> 02:58:17.659]  Don't check anything.
[02:58:18.922 --> 02:58:20.003]  What is this in your bag?
[02:58:20.083 --> 02:58:20.904]  It's a grape jelly.
[02:58:21.325 --> 02:58:22.707]  We could have you arrested.
[02:58:22.847 --> 02:58:25.150]  We gotta grab your testicles.
[02:58:25.991 --> 02:58:35.262]  I mean, it's just... But instead they'll get more power out of the attacks when it's the stinking government not doing its job controlling the border!
[02:58:37.347 --> 02:58:38.087]  I'm a citizen!
[02:58:38.107 --> 02:58:39.008]  I pay taxes!
[02:58:39.068 --> 02:58:40.628]  I don't have a criminal record!
[02:58:40.888 --> 02:58:42.749]  Keep your hands off my testicles!
[02:58:43.069 --> 02:58:44.530]  Keep your hands off my daughters!
[02:58:45.290 --> 02:58:45.730]  Get it?
[02:58:46.490 --> 02:58:47.031]  We'll be back.
[02:58:47.071 --> 02:58:48.571]  Jacari Jackson's coming up.
[02:58:48.591 --> 02:58:49.752]  And I got five more minutes.
[02:58:50.192 --> 02:58:51.032]  I got more to say.
[02:58:59.568 --> 02:59:00.930]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:59:01.210 --> 02:59:02.491]  You can't survive without it.
[02:59:02.691 --> 02:59:03.592]  But where do you get it?
[02:59:03.893 --> 02:59:09.659]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:59:09.879 --> 02:59:15.605]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:59:15.785 --> 02:59:32.655]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:59:33.035 --> 02:59:35.176]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:59:35.516 --> 02:59:36.716]  Stainless steel construction.
[02:59:36.996 --> 02:59:37.776]  Easy assembly.
[02:59:38.036 --> 02:59:38.656]  Low maintenance.
[02:59:38.956 --> 02:59:40.777]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:00:02.105 --> 03:00:06.706]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:10.807 --> 03:00:15.848]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:16.228 --> 03:00:18.549]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:00:22.750 --> 03:00:25.691]  Hostage situation in northern French town of Roe Bay.
[03:00:25.711 --> 03:00:30.012]  Jakari Jackson will have the latest coming up in T-minus eight minutes when he takes over.
[03:00:31.638 --> 03:00:34.281]  Two Black Lives Matter activists have just been shot.
[03:00:34.321 --> 03:00:35.782]  The details are just now coming in.
[03:00:36.163 --> 03:00:37.924]  Jakari Jackson will have that info.
[03:00:38.945 --> 03:00:45.212]  Turkey in 2012 said short-term border violation can never be a pretext for an attack.
[03:00:46.607 --> 03:00:51.251]  Erdogan contradicts previous statements by shooting down Russian jets.
[03:00:51.291 --> 03:00:58.417]  So that's a key article by Mikhail Thelin up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:00:58.457 --> 03:01:00.739]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[03:01:00.879 --> 03:01:03.582]  Is Jakari in the cockpit in there in the Situation Room?
[03:01:04.870 --> 03:01:05.851]  I want to get his take on this.
[03:01:05.871 --> 03:01:10.573]  I'm going to go to him in just a moment because I'm here in the war room.
[03:01:10.613 --> 03:01:11.554]  This is the war room.
[03:01:12.214 --> 03:01:12.934]  Got the big board.
[03:01:13.615 --> 03:01:15.436]  And then of course, that's a quote from Dr. Strangelove.
[03:01:15.716 --> 03:01:23.440]  And then the situation room is where the reporters pop in with breaking news, where we have extra guests and where they host the fourth hour, part of the time.
[03:01:23.460 --> 03:01:25.081]  And then we're also building a whole other studio.
[03:01:26.582 --> 03:01:32.249]  Over on the other side, so we can just have more shows, more analysis throughout the day as things break, as things unfold.
[03:01:32.289 --> 03:01:35.012]  But Jakari Jackson, so much happening.
[03:01:35.653 --> 03:01:45.345]  Let's go back, before we go to Jakari here for just a moment, and let's go to that BBC article about the situation in northern France, because I want to go over that for people, if we scroll down.
[03:01:47.625 --> 03:01:52.209]  Reports say that a group of armed men may have taken hostages in the northern French town.
[03:01:52.629 --> 03:01:56.852]  Local media said the incident took place at around 1900 local time.
[03:01:57.673 --> 03:01:59.535]  Witnesses reported gunshots being fired.
[03:01:59.575 --> 03:02:02.257]  Media reports say the area has been closed off by the police.
[03:02:02.917 --> 03:02:09.623]  The incident does not appear to be related to the ongoing security situation in France following the 13th November Paris attacks.
[03:02:09.683 --> 03:02:09.963]  Really?
[03:02:10.744 --> 03:02:12.625]  You mean like the army recruiting Marine Corps attacks?
[03:02:12.645 --> 03:02:13.226]  Those weren't either?
[03:02:13.266 --> 03:02:14.727]  Or Major Hassan at Fort Hood?
[03:02:15.347 --> 03:02:17.109]  How do they say that if they don't know anything?
[03:02:18.148 --> 03:02:19.629]  Are they going to blame patriots or something?
[03:02:19.689 --> 03:02:20.669]  Or blame right-wing French?
[03:02:20.709 --> 03:02:22.009]  I mean, I'm really looking for that.
[03:02:22.450 --> 03:02:24.390]  Jakari Jackson, things are crazy.
[03:02:24.430 --> 03:02:34.234]  I want to hear what you've got coming up, but I want your view on the shoot-down of this Russian plane and then blowing up the helicopter inside Syria with a U.S.-made TOW missile.
[03:02:34.734 --> 03:02:41.237]  I mean, I guess Turkey and the NATO and the crazy people running our government, I guess they really want to get in a war with Russia, Jakari.
[03:02:42.284 --> 03:02:44.105]  Well, it does seem like that is the case.
[03:02:44.145 --> 03:02:48.627]  We have a clip coming up of John McCain talking about how great it would be for Russian planes to be shot down.
[03:02:48.667 --> 03:02:52.408]  This is a statement that he made a little bit ago before this most recent situation.
[03:02:52.428 --> 03:02:53.389]  I forgot about that!
[03:02:53.569 --> 03:02:54.609]  Why didn't you come remind me?
[03:02:54.629 --> 03:02:56.710]  You guys, absolutely, I forgot about that!
[03:02:57.230 --> 03:02:58.872]  Well, give points to Darren McBrain for that one.
[03:02:58.912 --> 03:03:02.175]  He has the clip ready and we'll play that coming up here in just one moment.
[03:03:02.556 --> 03:03:07.280]  But yeah, we have also the report from Paul Joseph Watson that's going to air later on.
[03:03:07.441 --> 03:03:09.603]  The Russian jet shoot down what they're not telling you.
[03:03:09.943 --> 03:03:15.189]  And in that report, Paul breaks down all the facets of it, telling you how, you know, they say that they entered
[03:03:15.749 --> 03:03:15.989]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:32.811 --> 03:03:39.675]  Sticky situation, but also we definitely don't want anything that's going to launch us into a war or any type of nation.
[03:03:39.735 --> 03:03:42.456]  Why are you being discriminatory against World War 4 and nuclear war?
[03:03:42.496 --> 03:03:44.517]  I mean, maybe nuclear war has a right.
[03:03:44.577 --> 03:03:46.598]  Maybe nuclear weapons have a right to detonate and be free.
[03:03:46.638 --> 03:03:49.179]  Well, I'm sure they want to launch those nukes, Alex.
[03:03:49.279 --> 03:03:53.321]  I'm sure they've wanted to do that for a very long time, but it's not just something bad for us.
[03:03:53.381 --> 03:03:54.502]  It's bad for the whole world.
[03:03:54.542 --> 03:04:02.266]  You know, you have different estimates from different people, but all of the countries, or not all the countries, but enough countries around the world have enough to pretty much blow up the planet.
[03:04:02.626 --> 03:04:05.288]  And that's definitely not the situation that you want to get into.
[03:04:05.388 --> 03:04:06.509]  Why not blow up the planet?
[03:04:06.949 --> 03:04:08.811]  Why are you being discriminatory against that?
[03:04:09.351 --> 03:04:14.475]  Well, I'm sure Martians or other people who may be out there would love to see us blow ourselves to bits.
[03:04:14.915 --> 03:04:16.236]  I'm not one of those people, Alex.
[03:04:16.296 --> 03:04:18.818]  I'd like to live here on this planet a little bit longer.
[03:04:18.838 --> 03:04:20.819]  So you're pro-human, Jakari.
[03:04:20.859 --> 03:04:21.440]  How horrible.
[03:04:21.480 --> 03:04:25.102]  You just care about the planet and care about people in general.
[03:04:25.523 --> 03:04:28.585]  I'd say you're a humanitarian, which is what I call a global patriot.
[03:04:29.178 --> 03:04:30.519]  Well, that's what I try to be, Alex.
[03:04:30.579 --> 03:04:34.802]  I try to care for people around the world, and here in my own country as well.
[03:04:34.882 --> 03:04:45.549]  Well, that's why they call you an extremist, because you work for InfoWars, and you just don't want to have nuclear war, and you want to have freedom, and keep more of your tax money, and have a right to defend yourself, and you're a horrible person, and you're a Christian, which makes you even worse.
[03:04:46.070 --> 03:04:53.115]  Jakari Jackson will be hosting, coming up, kickin' butt, on this Tuesday, worldwide transmission, straight ahead.
[03:04:53.135 --> 03:04:54.696]  I'm Alex Jones, signing off.
[03:04:54.816 --> 03:04:55.657]  Do not forget,
[03:04:56.597 --> 03:04:58.700]  InfoWars Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock.
[03:04:59.481 --> 03:05:05.089]  And of course, free shipping right through Black Friday on everything at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:05:05.150 --> 03:05:07.914]  And your purchases are the fuel that funds our op.
[03:05:09.858 --> 03:05:12.462]  All you pro-vaccine people should rejoice at this news.
[03:05:12.802 --> 03:05:18.110]  Anti-vaccine parents to stop receiving child care benefits under Australian no-jab-no-pay law.
[03:05:18.290 --> 03:05:26.122]  The new changes that will take effect on January 1st, 2016 are projected to save the Australian government over 500 million dollars over four years.
[03:05:26.522 --> 03:05:29.084]  And how many children are not receiving their vaccines?
[03:05:29.264 --> 03:05:33.428]  According to the Australian Childhood Immunization Register, it's 1.77%.
[03:05:34.689 --> 03:05:37.871]  I thought all you needed was 90% to have herd immunity.
[03:05:38.112 --> 03:05:44.197]  The government believes that by removing the non-medical exemption, it will reinforce the importance of immunization and protecting public health.
[03:05:44.317 --> 03:05:48.540]  But what this is really about is the government wants to put anything in your body that they want.
[03:05:48.780 --> 03:05:50.802]  And they want to make sure you bend over and take it.
[03:05:51.042 --> 03:05:55.466]  A footnote in the article is that by 2020, childless couples will overtake those with children.
[03:05:55.706 --> 03:05:58.967]  Now I know where the next Muslim migrant invasion is going to take place.
[03:05:59.167 --> 03:06:02.629]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars Nightly News and InfoWars.com.
[03:06:02.749 --> 03:06:07.751]  Be sure you check out some of our great specials this week, running all week in the InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:07.891 --> 03:06:08.571]  Thanks for watching.
[03:06:09.366 --> 03:06:12.587]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:06:12.887 --> 03:06:20.888]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:06:21.128 --> 03:06:26.150]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:06:26.530 --> 03:06:28.830]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[03:06:29.050 --> 03:06:30.851]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[03:06:39.255 --> 03:06:40.175]  Brain Force is here.
[03:06:40.355 --> 03:06:42.456]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:06:42.556 --> 03:06:47.297]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[03:06:47.557 --> 03:06:50.678]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:06:50.838 --> 03:06:54.019]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:06:54.319 --> 03:06:56.020]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:06:56.340 --> 03:06:57.201]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[03:06:57.221 --> 03:06:58.163]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:06:58.403 --> 03:07:00.306]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[03:07:00.406 --> 03:07:05.212]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:07:05.232 --> 03:07:07.876]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[03:07:12.322 --> 03:07:21.964]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by Infowarslife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[03:07:22.264 --> 03:07:27.485]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[03:07:27.585 --> 03:07:36.447]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[03:07:36.747 --> 03:07:45.374]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[03:07:45.634 --> 03:07:52.580]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigerex herbal processing technique.
[03:07:52.720 --> 03:07:58.145]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best price.
[03:07:58.465 --> 03:07:59.546]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:07:59.586 --> 03:08:00.967]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:23.709 --> 03:08:25.630]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:25.650 --> 03:08:27.931]  This is the Info Wars Overdrive Hour.
[03:08:27.951 --> 03:08:30.272]  I will be your host, Jakari Jackson.
[03:08:30.352 --> 03:08:33.053]  Now, of course, we're going to talk about the Russia situation.
[03:08:33.193 --> 03:08:35.634]  The jet has recently been shot down.
[03:08:36.194 --> 03:08:45.138]  But first, right before we began our segment, they ran in here and they gave me this article talking about the hostage situation that is going on in a northern French town.
[03:08:45.678 --> 03:08:53.004]  Now, at this point, they're saying that they have no reason to believe it's connected to the previous terror attacks that we've seen in the area.
[03:08:53.184 --> 03:09:02.632]  Recently, that may be true, but I wouldn't put past these crazy terrorists to go into a different part of the area and try to kick up some stuff.
[03:09:03.412 --> 03:09:07.475]  And it says local news says the incident began around 1900 local time.
[03:09:07.955 --> 03:09:10.116]  Witnesses reported gunshots being fired.
[03:09:10.437 --> 03:09:14.059]  Media reports say the area has been closed off by the police.
[03:09:14.099 --> 03:09:18.682]  So we'll definitely keep you updated as that situation continues to grow.
[03:09:19.864 --> 03:09:24.467]  Now, let's talk about the situation that's going on with this Russian jet that has been shot down.
[03:09:24.547 --> 03:09:25.487]  I have this article here.
[03:09:25.967 --> 03:09:33.632]  Syrian rebels chant Allahu Akbar over body of dead Russian pilot after Turkey shoots down jet for violating its airspace.
[03:09:34.152 --> 03:09:40.775]  And it says the Russian jet had violated Turkish airspace and ignored 10 warnings in five minutes, says the military.
[03:09:41.156 --> 03:09:44.918]  And one pilot is dead and another has reportedly been captured.
[03:09:45.578 --> 03:09:57.927]  Now, the issue about this is, as you'll see in the Paul Joseph Watson piece that's going to air in our next segment, as one of the pilots ejected, they were shooting at him as he was coming towards the ground.
[03:09:58.287 --> 03:10:02.850]  And I don't mean pop shots, I mean they were shooting fully automatic AK-47s at this guy.
[03:10:02.890 --> 03:10:03.851]  They wanted him dead.
[03:10:04.571 --> 03:10:10.593]  So it's a very sticky situation and something that could potentially lead to a much larger conflict.
[03:10:10.633 --> 03:10:15.554]  Of course, we don't want to see that, but you know, not everything is within our hands to control.
[03:10:16.394 --> 03:10:23.716]  Now, as that relates to the world at large, we've seen all these terror attacks and calls to be safe around terrorism.
[03:10:23.736 --> 03:10:27.117]  And now we have this special report, this article on InfoWars.com.
[03:10:27.417 --> 03:10:30.558]  State Department issues travel advisory for the entire planet.
[03:10:30.978 --> 03:10:33.819]  And we just saw another attack going on in France.
[03:10:34.219 --> 03:10:38.742]  And now they're saying the whole world is pretty much a danger zone, flying into the danger zone.
[03:10:39.223 --> 03:10:43.926]  The government has issued terror warnings for every holiday since September 11, 2001.
[03:10:44.186 --> 03:10:50.171]  It is particularly fond of frightening people around Thanksgiving and Christmas, and this year is no exception.
[03:10:50.871 --> 03:10:52.332]  The State Department alerts U.S.
[03:10:52.372 --> 03:10:56.454]  citizens to possible risk of travel due to increased terrorism threats.
[03:10:57.075 --> 03:11:05.159]  Current information suggests that ISIL, Al Qaeda, Boko Haram and other terrorist groups continue to plan terrorist attacks in multiple regions.
[03:11:05.720 --> 03:11:14.845]  These attacks may employ a wide variety of tactics, using conventional and non-conventional weapons and targeting both official and private interest.
[03:11:15.345 --> 03:11:15.966]  We're good to go.
[03:11:37.360 --> 03:11:45.421]  If you were to be in some type of situation, you definitely want to alert the proper authorities if you're in some theater and you think a guy has a gun under his coat or whatever, but...
[03:11:46.724 --> 03:11:50.387]  It's also this sense of constant fear.
[03:11:50.447 --> 03:11:56.812]  You know, you guys have seen the terror scale, the red, the green, the blue, whatever the terror alert may be that day.
[03:11:57.552 --> 03:12:02.496]  And they really want you to be in a constant state of fear, a constant state of wanting them to swoop in and save you.
[03:12:02.956 --> 03:12:09.881]  But things are slightly looking up because we see that more and more police chiefs are actually telling people to arm themselves in their area.
[03:12:10.222 --> 03:12:13.104]  Of course, we've seen previously the Milwaukee Sheriff David Clark
[03:12:13.624 --> 03:12:16.086]  Say, you guys need to take the means to protect yourself.
[03:12:16.126 --> 03:12:18.667]  I believe they said something similar up in Detroit as well.
[03:12:19.087 --> 03:12:19.888]  And now the D.C.
[03:12:19.928 --> 03:12:23.770]  police chief is urging citizens to fight back against Paris-style attackers.
[03:12:24.331 --> 03:12:32.836]  And this is actually the police chief, if I'm not mistaken, who oversaw the arrest of Adam Kokesh when he cocked his shotgun, I guess two years ago now.
[03:12:33.616 --> 03:12:44.260]  And citizens of the nation's capital should be prepared to fight and try to take a gunman out should peristyle scenarios unfold prior to police arriving, the city's police chief has stated.
[03:12:44.600 --> 03:12:49.101]  And this is a statement she made while talking to 60 Minutes this past weekend.
[03:12:49.502 --> 03:12:56.124]  And I'm very happy to hear more police chiefs encouraging their citizens to be armed to take measures into their own hands, actual measures.
[03:12:57.386 --> 03:13:04.832]  Because we've seen previously, if you're in some type of situation, they say, use a stapler or hide or throw cans.
[03:13:04.852 --> 03:13:06.073]  That's what they tell the kids at school.
[03:13:06.414 --> 03:13:11.478]  Hide under your desk and throw Campbell's soup at the guy when he comes in with the AK-47.
[03:13:11.498 --> 03:13:15.941]  Not arm the teachers or do some other means to protect the children.
[03:13:15.981 --> 03:13:23.488]  No, they want the kids to throw canned goods instead of having teachers armed like they are in, I think it's Harold ISD in Northern Texas.
[03:13:23.888 --> 03:13:25.429]  Where they have a very strict procedure.
[03:13:25.449 --> 03:13:28.291]  They make the teachers qualify every month with the pistols.
[03:13:28.311 --> 03:13:29.352]  And I think it's a great plan.
[03:13:29.752 --> 03:13:33.374]  Because, as the superintendent told me, they are their first responders.
[03:13:33.414 --> 03:13:36.797]  They can't wait, you know, 45 minutes for a deputy to get there.
[03:13:36.837 --> 03:13:38.858]  They have to have the means to protect yourself.
[03:13:38.918 --> 03:13:39.779]  And it's not just there.
[03:13:40.379 --> 03:13:46.062]  Anyplace in the world you go, whether it's in your home, your business, if you're out shopping, you are the first responder.
[03:13:46.082 --> 03:13:51.765]  You know, because as great as the cops may be, or well-intentioned as they may be, they can't be there to protect you all the time.
[03:13:51.805 --> 03:13:55.947]  And even if they do arrive on the scene in a rapid fashion, well, who's the bad guy?
[03:13:55.987 --> 03:13:56.568]  Where did he go?
[03:13:56.588 --> 03:13:57.668]  Did he tuck his gun in his coat?
[03:13:57.688 --> 03:13:58.849]  Did he walk out the back door?
[03:13:59.169 --> 03:14:00.230]  They don't know all these things.
[03:14:00.530 --> 03:14:03.051]  And anybody there is a potential threat to them.
[03:14:03.471 --> 03:14:07.914]  So you definitely want to at least have the means to identify the guy and maybe take a shot at him if you can.
[03:14:08.334 --> 03:14:11.698]  That doesn't mean that everybody is going to be packing and there's going to be bullets flying everywhere.
[03:14:12.039 --> 03:14:14.182]  Because we saw the shooting, I believe it was at a mall.
[03:14:14.202 --> 03:14:18.447]  A gunman walks in and a guy just pulls out his Glock.
[03:14:18.727 --> 03:14:20.710]  He aims it at the guy and the guy shot himself.
[03:14:20.750 --> 03:14:21.872]  He didn't even have to fire a shot.
[03:14:21.892 --> 03:14:23.113]  The good guy with the gun.
[03:14:24.133 --> 03:14:27.235]  So that's just a small smattering of what's going on today.
[03:14:27.615 --> 03:14:31.597]  Now, as we're talking about guns, we're going to talk about a shooting that happened in Chicago last year.
[03:14:32.017 --> 03:14:35.759]  Chicago cop charged with murder for shooting black teen 16 times.
[03:14:36.119 --> 03:14:37.259]  It's not because he's black.
[03:14:37.400 --> 03:14:39.340]  I mean, because I guess that's a new thing.
[03:14:39.360 --> 03:14:43.743]  They always want to say the race of the victim or the race of the cop who did the shooting.
[03:14:43.763 --> 03:14:46.304]  You know, I care just as much about Kelly Thomas, who was a white guy.
[03:14:46.684 --> 03:14:47.244]  We're good to go.
[03:14:58.533 --> 03:14:58.753]  Let's go
[03:15:19.756 --> 03:15:20.417]  Excessive.
[03:15:21.037 --> 03:15:26.603]  Like I said, I had to see the video to know for sure, but 16 times sounds like a lot of times to shoot a guy.
[03:15:27.243 --> 03:15:29.746]  Witnesses say that the guy didn't approach the officer.
[03:15:29.906 --> 03:15:33.930]  They say he had a knife, but witnesses were saying that the guy was walking away at the time he was shot.
[03:15:33.950 --> 03:15:37.573]  Of course, the officers say he was charging them like a raging bull.
[03:15:37.913 --> 03:15:41.036]  So we'll just have to wait to see how this thing unfolds.
[03:15:42.017 --> 03:15:47.064]  Now, something that we reported on earlier this year, the situation that's going on with Planned Parenthood.
[03:15:47.485 --> 03:15:57.780]  In particular, here in Texas, they have a very strong campaign to defund Planned Parenthood, and now Planned Parenthood is suing Texas over threat to cut Medicaid funding.
[03:15:58.200 --> 03:16:04.181]  Now, I've been to a lot of these rallies, pro-abortion, anti-abortion, because I don't just go to rallies of stuff I agree with.
[03:16:04.221 --> 03:16:09.342]  You know, I've been to anti-gun rallies, and I try to talk to people and understand why they feel the way they feel.
[03:16:09.962 --> 03:16:24.545]  And now we see Planned Parenthood and other women's health providers and groups of women in need of reproductive health care sued Texas on Monday, seeking to halt its threatening to cut Medicaid funding, a move they said was more about politics than health care.
[03:16:25.649 --> 03:16:27.711]  My issue with this is Planned Parenthood.
[03:16:27.831 --> 03:16:28.832]  I meet people all the time.
[03:16:28.872 --> 03:16:36.258]  They say, Planned Parenthood, what's it, 3% or whatever number they throw out, only 3% of their care goes towards abortion.
[03:16:36.739 --> 03:16:42.583]  And as Reverend Childress pointed out to me, he said he would like to check the books and I would like to, too, because they can tell you anything.
[03:16:42.624 --> 03:16:43.224]  Like, well, it's only 3%.
[03:16:43.284 --> 03:16:44.585]  How do we know?
[03:16:44.685 --> 03:16:48.589]  Do they have an independent auditor going there and check the books on these things?
[03:16:49.089 --> 03:16:49.890]  But beyond that,
[03:16:51.061 --> 03:16:53.302]  Even if it is 3%, it's 3%.
[03:16:53.442 --> 03:16:59.685]  If they just eliminate that 3%, 97% of the people who protest outside Planned Parenthood will disappear overnight.
[03:17:00.006 --> 03:17:02.287]  You'll never see from them again because that's their issue.
[03:17:02.347 --> 03:17:03.007]  It's abortion.
[03:17:03.327 --> 03:17:06.729]  They don't want their taxpayers going to kill children.
[03:17:07.049 --> 03:17:09.770]  It always makes me laugh, these people with these ideologies.
[03:17:09.790 --> 03:17:10.451]  Let's ban this.
[03:17:10.491 --> 03:17:12.412]  Let's ban that to keep the kids safe.
[03:17:12.652 --> 03:17:14.733]  But they won't ban abortion to keep the kids safe.
[03:17:14.773 --> 03:17:17.734]  They want to ban, you know, drunk driving and guns and all this other stuff.
[03:17:17.754 --> 03:17:20.336]  And of course, I'm not supporting drunk driving, but
[03:17:20.976 --> 03:17:23.798]  They don't want to ban abortion to keep the kids safe in the womb.
[03:17:24.179 --> 03:17:29.543]  Meanwhile, they'll come out with all types of other measures and scream, hell, Satan, and throw Molotov cocktails.
[03:17:29.563 --> 03:17:32.305]  And those are things that just happened here in the city of Austin, Texas.
[03:17:32.906 --> 03:17:37.029]  So, you know, it's not something that I support at all, supporting Planned Parenthood.
[03:17:38.050 --> 03:17:38.430]  That is.
[03:17:39.071 --> 03:17:57.800]  I think it's a rather wicked organization founded by a rather wicked woman and I don't want anything to do with it and I definitely don't want my taxpayer dollars going towards it because I've run into people they have these signs here in Texas I don't know about your state but they have these signs they say like keep your prayers out of my vagina and they have like a uterus and it says come and take it on it.
[03:17:59.338 --> 03:18:05.562]  And my deal about that is, if you don't want my prayers in your uterus, keep your vagina out of my tax dollars.
[03:18:05.662 --> 03:18:07.583]  Or keep my tax dollars out of your vagina.
[03:18:08.164 --> 03:18:14.728]  Because you guys are saying that you want me to pay for all this stuff, meanwhile you don't want me to have any say in how the money is used at all.
[03:18:14.748 --> 03:18:19.631]  I'm like, no, I'm not giving you a blank check to go chop up babies and talk about how you want to buy Lambos with them.
[03:18:20.111 --> 03:18:21.953]  No, I've met various people.
[03:18:21.973 --> 03:18:29.519]  They say, well, it's not all about, you know, some person who just wants to get abortion just because they have people who have medical issues or whatever else.
[03:18:30.140 --> 03:18:32.081]  And, you know, I feel sorry for those people.
[03:18:32.101 --> 03:18:38.287]  But at the same time, I'm not trying to pay for somebody who just wants to get rid of their baby because it's an inconvenience to them.
[03:18:39.827 --> 03:18:43.829]  Now before we go into more special reports and our other breaks, I want to come to this report.
[03:18:44.529 --> 03:18:51.793]  Now, we've shown you the articles and documents about teenagers and other people who go and join ISIS or Al Qaeda for a weekend.
[03:18:51.813 --> 03:18:53.714]  They think it's like going to summer camp or something.
[03:18:54.094 --> 03:19:01.577]  So they go out there, they join ISIS or these terrorist organizations, and then they can't leave and they end up dead because they want to leave and this is one such case.
[03:19:02.018 --> 03:19:02.498]  A teenage
[03:19:02.998 --> 03:19:09.932]  Islamic poster girl who fled Austria to join ISIS is beaten to death by the terror group after trying to escape from Syria.
[03:19:10.819 --> 03:19:17.420]  And as people point out, they're out there shooting people who look like them, people who are from their region, and all this other stuff.
[03:19:17.440 --> 03:19:19.501]  So when you show up, say, hey, I'm out here.
[03:19:19.761 --> 03:19:20.501]  What's up, bro?
[03:19:20.821 --> 03:19:23.721]  You want to go play hacky sack after we kill some Christians?
[03:19:23.741 --> 03:19:25.662]  We're like, no, bro, we're going to beat you to death.
[03:19:26.102 --> 03:19:27.602]  Or, young lady, we're going to beat you to death.
[03:19:27.962 --> 03:19:35.383]  It's a very sad situation, but at the same time, I just don't get the cult of personality that attracts people to want to join a group like ISIS.
[03:19:35.723 --> 03:19:38.744]  Not saying that everything everybody else does is good and
[03:19:39.344 --> 03:19:42.908]  And awesome, because I can tell you many things are wrong with our own U.S.
[03:19:42.928 --> 03:19:53.738]  government, but to go out and join a group like this when they're killing Christians, chopping people's heads off, throwing people off buildings, ripping people's vital organs out, and all these other things, it's just not a good look.
[03:19:54.018 --> 03:20:00.425]  So stay tuned, we'll come back right after this break with a special report from Paul Joseph Watson and also the Make Fun of Hillary contest.

[03:24:32.983 --> 03:24:36.964]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson, for this InfoWars Overdrive Hour.
[03:24:37.565 --> 03:24:41.826]  Now before we continue, we want to remind you of the great specials we have in the InfoWars shop.

[03:25:20.454 --> 03:25:25.838]  Now let's go to the special report from Paul Joseph Watson, what they're not telling you about the Russian shoot-down.
[03:25:26.411 --> 03:25:30.656]  Here's what they're not telling you about the Turkish shoot-down of the Russian fighter jet.
[03:25:31.216 --> 03:25:39.305]  Days before the incident, Turkey warned Russia that if they didn't stop bombing ISIS, there would be, quote, serious consequences.
[03:25:39.846 --> 03:25:47.894]  Ankara threatened Moscow with retaliation if it didn't, quote, immediately end its operation against ISIS.
[03:25:48.675 --> 03:25:55.280]  Putin responded to the shoot down of the jet by labelling it a stab in the back by accomplices of terrorism.
[03:25:55.720 --> 03:25:56.501]  And he's right.
[03:25:57.181 --> 03:26:01.705]  Turkey has been supporting, arming and financing ISIS for years.
[03:26:02.165 --> 03:26:05.868]  Turkey is a state sponsor of terrorism.
[03:26:06.528 --> 03:26:13.913]  Turkey shot down the Russian jet because it's butthurt that Russia has been obliterating ISIS for the past two months.
[03:26:14.593 --> 03:26:29.923]  Turkey has aligned with jihadists, so-called moderate rebels, who aren't moderate, as well as al-Qaeda groups and ISIS, in an effort to topple Bashar al-Assad, a secular leader who is trying to fight against Islamic extremism.
[03:26:30.643 --> 03:26:38.061]  Turkey is a corrupt, jihadist a**hole whose soccer fans booed the victims of the Paris Massacre.
[03:26:46.101 --> 03:26:54.523]  For years, Turkey has been buying and facilitating the sale of ISIS's stolen oil supplies on the black market.
[03:26:54.543 --> 03:27:00.765]  800 million dollars worth of ISIS oil has been sold in Turkey, a supposed US ally.
[03:27:01.945 --> 03:27:08.267]  ISIS trucks are routinely allowed to cross back and forth between the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa and Turkey.
[03:27:09.110 --> 03:27:20.639]  Documents recovered from a raid on an ISIS safehouse this past summer confirm that, quote, direct dealings between Turkish officials and ranking ISIS members was now undeniable.
[03:27:21.159 --> 03:27:33.989]  A former ISIS communications technician told Newsweek that his job was to, quote, connect ISIS field captains and commanders from Syria with people in Turkey on innumerable occasions.
[03:27:34.930 --> 03:27:41.235]  ISIS commanders told us to fear nothing at all because there was full cooperation with the Turks, he said.
[03:27:41.255 --> 03:27:46.940]  A Jordan security official revealed that ISIS jihadists had received training from Turkey.
[03:27:47.620 --> 03:27:55.367]  An Egyptian security official revealed that Turkey is providing direct intelligence and logistical support to ISIS.
[03:27:56.508 --> 03:28:03.814]  Turkey is also bombing and killing Kurdish separatists, one of the primary groups in the region fighting against ISIS.
[03:28:04.690 --> 03:28:08.731]  We don't know for sure whether the Russian jet even crossed into Turkish airspace.
[03:28:09.131 --> 03:28:12.612]  Russia claims it was four kilometres within Syrian territory.
[03:28:13.193 --> 03:28:20.495]  But as observers have noted, even if the jet did violate Turkish airspace, it could only have been for a matter of seconds.
[03:28:21.095 --> 03:28:30.085]  The fact that Turkey massively overreacted and shot down the fighter jet proves what an irrational threat Erdogan poses to the region.
[03:28:30.586 --> 03:28:40.818]  Video has also emerged of the so-called moderate rebels, who aren't moderate, shooting at the Russian jet pilot as he descends to the ground while chanting Allah Akbar.
[03:28:52.475 --> 03:28:59.200]  By not cancelling Turkey's membership, NATO is harbouring a state sponsor of ISIS.
[03:28:59.861 --> 03:29:05.305]  But, like Turkey, NATO and the US don't want to eliminate ISIS in the region.
[03:29:06.126 --> 03:29:13.631]  They foresaw the rise of ISIS as a useful tool with which to destabilise and isolate Bashar al-Assad.
[03:29:14.392 --> 03:29:22.258]  The US waited 15 months before targeting ISIS's oil infrastructure, which funds over half of its operations.
[03:29:23.159 --> 03:29:36.509]  Thanks to the US, NATO and Turkey attempting to stop Russia from destroying ISIS, the Islamic State will continue to wreak havoc across both the Middle East and Europe.
[03:29:40.964 --> 03:29:43.266]  Alright, another great report by Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:29:43.286 --> 03:29:51.231]  Now we want you to stay tuned because coming up after this break, we'll tell you about the national contest to stop Hillary's attack on free speech and what you can do to contribute.
[03:29:51.251 --> 03:29:53.673]  I'm Takari Jackson for InfoWars.com.
[03:29:53.693 --> 03:29:55.214]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:59.036 --> 03:29:59.917]  We're on the march.
[03:30:00.437 --> 03:30:02.038]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.959 --> 03:30:05.641]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.887 --> 03:30:12.490]  All you pro-vaccine people should rejoice at this news!
[03:30:12.830 --> 03:30:18.136]  Anti-vaccine parents to stop receiving child care benefits under Australian no-jab-no-pay law.
[03:30:18.336 --> 03:30:26.145]  The new changes that will take effect on January 1st, 2016 are projected to save the Australian government over 500 million dollars over four years.
[03:30:26.565 --> 03:30:29.106]  And how many children are not receiving their vaccines?
[03:30:29.286 --> 03:30:33.449]  According to the Australian Childhood Immunization Register, it's 1.77%.
[03:30:34.729 --> 03:30:37.911]  I thought all you needed was 90% to have herd immunity.
[03:30:38.151 --> 03:30:44.194]  The government believes that by removing the non-medical exemption, it will reinforce the importance of immunization and protecting public health.
[03:30:44.354 --> 03:30:48.556]  But what this is really about is the government wants to put anything in your body that they want.
[03:30:48.816 --> 03:30:50.818]  And they want to make sure you bend over and take it.
[03:30:51.078 --> 03:30:55.480]  A footnote in the article is that by 2020, childless couples will overtake those with children.
[03:30:55.740 --> 03:30:59.003]  Now I know where the next Muslim migrant invasion is going to take place.
[03:30:59.203 --> 03:31:02.667]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars Nightly News and InfoWars.com.
[03:31:02.767 --> 03:31:07.792]  Be sure you check out some of our great specials this week running all week in the InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:31:21.503 --> 03:31:31.846]  I'm for prosperity, I'm for having good products that make our lives better, but I don't just mindlessly worship the holiday where we're supposedly getting the best deal ever, and statistics show it's one of the worst days to shop.
[03:31:32.086 --> 03:31:39.368]  That's why we are taking the InfoWar to the next level and actually making InfoWarStore.com Black Friday a super deal.

[03:32:12.706 --> 03:32:20.711]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:32:20.951 --> 03:32:25.975]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[03:32:47.426 --> 03:32:49.067]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[03:32:49.127 --> 03:32:50.608]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:32:50.708 --> 03:32:53.911]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:32:54.211 --> 03:32:56.013]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:32:56.173 --> 03:32:57.074]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[03:32:57.094 --> 03:32:58.074]  It doesn't have garbage in it.

[03:33:10.970 --> 03:33:16.020]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.381 --> 03:33:18.685]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:33:23.246 --> 03:33:25.248]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.308 --> 03:33:29.152]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson, on this InfoWars Overdrive segment.
[03:33:29.652 --> 03:33:35.478]  Now, at the beginning of our hour, we were talking to Alex Jones about John McCain and all the crazy things he's done.
[03:33:35.518 --> 03:33:39.742]  We've seen him overseas hanging out with the Syrian rebels, aka the Al-Qaeda rebels.
[03:33:39.762 --> 03:33:41.043]  Talking about, I know these guys.
[03:33:41.103 --> 03:33:42.244]  And then people say, well, hold on.
[03:33:42.264 --> 03:33:43.405]  Why are you hanging out with these Syrians?
[03:33:43.525 --> 03:33:45.087]  Oh, I don't know anything about that.
[03:33:45.127 --> 03:33:46.028]  But you just said you know them.
[03:33:46.368 --> 03:33:48.030]  Anyway, he does all that crazy stuff.
[03:33:48.050 --> 03:33:54.096]  Now, here's a throwback clip of him saying how much you'd love to see Russian flights or Russian jets shot down.
[03:33:54.116 --> 03:33:56.518]  We need to have a no-fly zone.
[03:33:56.558 --> 03:33:58.600]  We need to have a buffer zone for refugees.
[03:33:58.660 --> 03:34:00.422]  We need to provide certain kinds of help.
[03:34:00.442 --> 03:34:10.672]  No, I know that, Senator, but if they're attacking the very guys who we want to see topple Assad, you would let American planes just pass them and let them do that?
[03:34:11.391 --> 03:34:17.456]  No, but I might do what we did in Afghanistan many years ago to give those guys the ability to shoot down those planes.
[03:34:17.896 --> 03:34:19.938]  That equipment is available.
[03:34:21.299 --> 03:34:22.360]  Who would be shooting them down?
[03:34:23.177 --> 03:34:24.057]  The Free Syrian Army.
[03:34:25.298 --> 03:34:28.738]  Yeah, his buddy is the Free Syrian Army, aka the Al Qaeda rebels.
[03:34:29.539 --> 03:34:36.340]  As Paul Gilles Watson has documented numerous times, many of these people aren't even Syrian, they're just proxies that they continually move around.
[03:34:36.420 --> 03:34:41.461]  So, you can find all those clips, I believe David's going to be talking about that more on the InfoWars Nightly News tonight.
[03:34:42.002 --> 03:34:43.302]  But now, let's talk about Hillary.
[03:34:43.922 --> 03:34:55.789]  Because you guys know Mrs. Clinton, she has come out against the Laugh Factory, a group of comedians, for dare making fun of her, even though you can turn on Saturday Night Live or any late night talk show, and they make fun of all manner of politicians.
[03:34:55.849 --> 03:34:58.191]  It's not something that's directly related to her.
[03:34:58.511 --> 03:35:00.212]  And now she's cracking down on free speech.
[03:35:00.672 --> 03:35:08.257]  Now, a couple weeks ago, myself, Kid Daniels, and Michael Zimmerman had a chance to go to Mizzou, and one of the most refreshing things about that trip
[03:35:08.717 --> 03:35:12.359]  was meeting a group of young libertarians who had a free speech wall.
[03:35:12.519 --> 03:35:14.280]  And the wall was just as it implies.
[03:35:14.320 --> 03:35:15.460]  It was a free speech wall.
[03:35:15.740 --> 03:35:17.641]  You could walk up, you could write anything you wanted on it.
[03:35:17.941 --> 03:35:18.842]  They did not censor you.
[03:35:18.882 --> 03:35:20.562]  They did not suggest anything that you say.
[03:35:20.883 --> 03:35:22.203]  You just wrote whatever you felt like.
[03:35:22.443 --> 03:35:24.724]  And it was a true expression of free speech.
[03:35:25.084 --> 03:35:26.665]  Some people's speech was political.
[03:35:26.685 --> 03:35:27.826]  Some people's was not.
[03:35:28.146 --> 03:35:30.347]  But regardless, they exercised their free speech.
[03:35:30.707 --> 03:35:34.769]  So before we go to this video about Hillary and all the things you can do to get involved
[03:35:35.289 --> 03:35:35.610]  I don't know.
[03:35:58.041 --> 03:35:59.642]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[03:35:59.702 --> 03:36:01.142]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:36:01.222 --> 03:36:03.543]  Now, we've seen a lot of attacks on free speech.
[03:36:04.323 --> 03:36:13.826]  And everybody knows that I was against the Republicans trying to put, you know, parental warnings on music because it's up to parents to decide what their kids listen to and what they watch.
[03:36:14.067 --> 03:36:15.187]  The government shouldn't be involved.
[03:36:15.227 --> 03:36:17.348]  And we always said that could lead to censorship.
[03:36:18.248 --> 03:36:20.169]  I am not partisan about this.
[03:36:20.209 --> 03:36:20.909]  I'm a libertarian.
[03:36:21.709 --> 03:36:26.231]  But man, the Democrats have gone like a thousand light years worse.
[03:36:27.151 --> 03:36:33.258]  Trying to ban the terms mother and father or boy or girl because it might hurt a transgendered person.
[03:36:33.539 --> 03:36:34.360]  Whoever said that?
[03:36:34.840 --> 03:36:41.988]  Jerry Seinfeld and others have come out and said they won't even go to colleges and do their comedy routine because people flip out on them.
[03:36:42.889 --> 03:36:51.994]  We have seen so many cases of this where political correctness has become a serious tyranny in this nation.
[03:36:52.074 --> 03:37:07.803]  And it's been directed, not just in the United States, but in Europe as well, where if you criticize open borders from Syria, with all these militants coming in and blowing stuff up, Facebook is shutting you down, the police are even raiding people's houses for their speech.
[03:37:07.983 --> 03:37:10.265]  And now, Hillary Clinton,
[03:37:11.195 --> 03:37:22.944]  Has sent her campaign and had high-level campaign officials call the Laugh Factory undoubtedly the most famous comedy hall, comedy club in the world.
[03:37:23.105 --> 03:37:23.945]  I mean, you name it.
[03:37:24.065 --> 03:37:26.307]  So many of the greats have come from there.
[03:37:26.387 --> 03:37:32.892]  Speaking of, you know, Jerry Seinfeld, his own daughter showed up this year and they said, we're moving back to New York so you can see more boys.
[03:37:33.153 --> 03:37:33.753]  She's 14.
[03:37:34.033 --> 03:37:36.035]  She said, Dad, boys and girls together is sexist.
[03:37:36.335 --> 03:37:38.097]  Just the word boy and girl is sexist.
[03:37:38.817 --> 03:37:39.978]  This is by design.
[03:37:40.498 --> 03:37:45.241]  Hillary has had her campaign threatened to, quote, bankrupt them, shut them down.
[03:37:45.281 --> 03:37:46.402]  You've got to read these articles.
[03:37:46.682 --> 03:37:48.403]  Hillary Clinton's Laugh Factory threats.
[03:37:48.523 --> 03:37:53.206]  Why did her campaign want comedians' personal contact information?
[03:37:53.886 --> 03:37:54.687]  So they can threaten them.
[03:37:55.587 --> 03:38:01.731]  This is the reality of what's going on, and it's getting worse and worse and worse.
[03:38:01.791 --> 03:38:03.372]  And if they can shut down comedy,
[03:38:04.565 --> 03:38:05.946]  They could shut down any free speech.
[03:38:06.607 --> 03:38:14.954]  Going back thousands of years ago in medieval Europe, or even Rome, the person that had the most free speech, other than the king, was the jester.
[03:38:15.455 --> 03:38:17.657]  Because they could say things nobody else was allowed to.
[03:38:20.059 --> 03:38:27.325]  Musicians would go around and play their three-stringed instruments would also have ballads against corruption.
[03:38:27.946 --> 03:38:29.487]  This goes back to the time of Robin Hood.
[03:38:30.345 --> 03:38:41.114]  But now Hillary Clinton, across the board, has said that Bernie Sanders is sexist because Bernie Sanders has criticized her.
[03:38:41.294 --> 03:38:43.756]  This is the insanity.
[03:38:44.116 --> 03:38:50.362]  So I don't care if you're left, right, center, libertarian, black, white, Jewish, German, Chinese, Mexican, or purple.
[03:38:51.451 --> 03:39:04.138]  Everyone should see this as a major threat, because they are intimidating TV shows, writers, you name it, to self-censor, to control what they're saying, and this is the greatest attack I've ever seen on free speech.
[03:39:04.178 --> 03:39:07.560]  This is 21st century book-burning.
[03:39:07.600 --> 03:39:15.384]  In fact, I want to go live and walk around some of the studio and talk about this crap with people, because I personally, I personally have had enough of this.
[03:39:16.773 --> 03:39:19.134]  I have made it my business to make fun of politicians.
[03:39:19.174 --> 03:39:23.155]  I've made it my business, too, to criticize them and basically call them frauds.
[03:39:23.195 --> 03:39:26.477]  When Bush lied about Iraq and WMDs, I called him a piece of crap.
[03:39:26.857 --> 03:39:28.357]  I mean, we got him right here as the Joker.
[03:39:29.398 --> 03:39:29.958]  He's a clown.
[03:39:30.931 --> 03:39:32.092]  Will I get shut down?
[03:39:32.132 --> 03:39:33.334]  Will I get arrested for this?
[03:39:33.354 --> 03:39:39.000]  I mean, if I want to throw darts at a picture of Hillary Clinton, it's my right as an American and as a free person to do it.
[03:39:39.440 --> 03:39:40.841]  I mean, here's Barack Obama right here.
[03:39:41.562 --> 03:39:42.383]  I got him as a clown.
[03:39:42.403 --> 03:39:43.164]  Is that okay with you?
[03:39:43.744 --> 03:39:48.249]  It's about being able to make fun of who you want as long as you don't hurt somebody else, okay?
[03:39:48.910 --> 03:39:49.751]  I mean, look at this crap.
[03:39:50.351 --> 03:39:50.712]  Look at this.
[03:39:53.137 --> 03:39:55.839]  People make fun of the Democratic Party, political cartoons.
[03:39:56.219 --> 03:39:58.721]  They'll call them a bunch of jackasses, call them Republicans' elephants.
[03:39:59.062 --> 03:39:59.922]  That's what it's all about.
[03:40:00.363 --> 03:40:02.024]  We have unmasked Hillary Clinton.
[03:40:02.484 --> 03:40:09.270]  And if we want to call her a lying, demonic, corporate witch who helped give the banks unlimited banker bailout money, then you know what?
[03:40:09.470 --> 03:40:10.030]  We can do it.
[03:40:10.190 --> 03:40:11.051]  You got that, Hillary?
[03:40:11.631 --> 03:40:12.612]  We're sick of your crap!
[03:40:13.213 --> 03:40:16.135]  Free speech needs to be protected in this nation.
[03:40:16.355 --> 03:40:21.839]  If we want to talk bad about the Lord and Savior Barack Obama, bought and paid for by crony capitalists, we're gonna do it!
[03:40:22.600 --> 03:40:23.681]  We're going to do it all we want.
[03:40:24.121 --> 03:40:25.882]  And we don't want any harm to come to Obama.
[03:40:26.002 --> 03:40:26.882]  That'd make him a martyr.
[03:40:27.082 --> 03:40:30.924]  But we're going to destroy his name and what he stands for and the frauds he pushes.
[03:40:30.944 --> 03:40:33.205]  In fact, let's go talk to some more of the crew.
[03:40:33.225 --> 03:40:36.907]  I don't even know where I'm going with this other than the fact we're going to resist it.
[03:40:37.347 --> 03:40:38.328]  And that's what this comes down to.
[03:40:39.148 --> 03:40:43.933]  If you're sick of this crap, then take action yourself and engage in the First Amendment and free speech.
[03:40:45.154 --> 03:40:49.599]  We're announcing a $5,000 contest that runs until December 21st.
[03:40:49.679 --> 03:40:54.183]  You've got a month to produce a video and upload it on YouTube and one other platform.
[03:40:54.964 --> 03:41:01.413]  Where you make fun of Hillary Clinton and her policies, or how she looks, or what she stands for, or any of it.
[03:41:01.933 --> 03:41:05.178]  The truth is, with the new media, the system can't control everybody.
[03:41:05.438 --> 03:41:11.506]  He wants to have select comedy on Comedy Central with Jon Stewart, you know, with his fake liberal garbage, or...
[03:41:12.387 --> 03:41:13.548]  With people on Saturday Night Live.
[03:41:13.768 --> 03:41:19.194]  But then no one else can engage in it because the political bosses will intimidate you.
[03:41:19.674 --> 03:41:21.456]  And that's because they know Hillary is a joke.
[03:41:21.796 --> 03:41:24.559]  And she personally, it's been documented, can't handle criticism.
[03:41:24.799 --> 03:41:26.460]  Well, she certainly shouldn't be president.
[03:41:26.961 --> 03:41:28.943]  I've been made fun of all over Comedy Central.
[03:41:29.103 --> 03:41:30.124]  I've been made fun of all over.
[03:41:30.224 --> 03:41:30.664]  I love it!
[03:41:31.225 --> 03:41:32.766]  Because people will come find the real me.
[03:41:33.627 --> 03:41:36.069]  And I will fight to the death for their right.
[03:41:36.790 --> 03:41:41.833]  On Comedy Central and Bill Maher on HBO, to make statements about me that aren't true.
[03:41:42.433 --> 03:41:45.915]  To make statements about me saying, Alex Jones thinks cancer is good for you.
[03:41:46.916 --> 03:41:47.636]  Wasn't true!
[03:41:47.936 --> 03:41:49.197]  But I can now counter them.
[03:41:49.457 --> 03:41:50.218]  They're desperate.
[03:41:50.878 --> 03:41:53.199]  But see, they want to restrict what I have to say.
[03:41:54.140 --> 03:42:04.866]  If the left doesn't stand up to this, if the right doesn't stand up to this, with the persecution of the Tea Party, the persecution with the IRS of Christian organizations and veterans groups and gun groups, we're going to lose it all.
[03:42:05.747 --> 03:42:09.466]  If they would have arrested Michael Moore for his documentary, I would have come out against it.
[03:42:10.515 --> 03:42:11.355]  I would have stood for him.
[03:42:11.395 --> 03:42:14.657]  Alright, so there's the report by Alex Jones.
[03:42:14.717 --> 03:42:18.619]  Now I want to redirect you guys to the actual site so you can get all the information you need.
[03:42:18.719 --> 03:42:20.340]  Be sure to follow the contest rules.
[03:42:20.800 --> 03:42:24.041]  It is national contest to stop Hillary's attack on free speech.
[03:42:24.422 --> 03:42:29.244]  You can shoot a video making fun of Hillary and there are $6,000 in cash prizes.
[03:42:29.284 --> 03:42:33.266]  Now, as I was saying, if you scroll down you can see all the contest rules, the official rules.
[03:42:33.606 --> 03:42:36.888]  Make sure you follow all the rules so you can be official in the contest.
[03:42:36.928 --> 03:42:37.488]  We have got
[03:42:37.968 --> 03:42:38.308]  Yes, I am.
[03:43:06.803 --> 03:43:08.063]  How are you doing today?
[03:43:08.404 --> 03:43:10.444]  Hillary Clinton, she's out of control.
[03:43:11.485 --> 03:43:16.887]  I'm just waiting for her to be indicted because something's got to happen here.
[03:43:16.947 --> 03:43:31.992]  What she's done as Secretary of State, what she did as First Lady, what she did as First Lady in Arkansas with Bill, her crimes are piling up and there's no accountability for them.
[03:43:32.353 --> 03:43:33.093]  What's the deal?
[03:43:34.192 --> 03:43:38.234]  Well, I was talking to Larry Nichols, the Clinton insider, and I asked him the same question.
[03:43:38.274 --> 03:43:42.437]  I said, why are they focusing so hard on the emails instead of something like Benghazi?
[03:43:42.837 --> 03:43:46.999]  And he was like, well, Benghazi affects a lot of people outside of Hillary.
[03:43:47.059 --> 03:43:52.062]  I suppose if they could just focus on the email scandal, they can really go after her and target her.
[03:43:52.342 --> 03:44:00.266]  He also went a step further and he said, you know, having worked in the Clinton machine, he said if he was running Hillary's campaign, this is exactly how he'd be running it.
[03:44:00.607 --> 03:44:02.928]  He says Clinton has to run as an underdog.
[03:44:03.288 --> 03:44:04.088]  I don't think so.
[03:44:35.239 --> 03:44:36.580]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:44:37.640 --> 03:44:38.240]  I'm doing good.
[03:44:38.260 --> 03:44:40.702]  I just wanted to say you've been doing a great job up there.
[03:44:40.722 --> 03:44:43.063]  I really like watching the show when you're hosting.
[03:44:43.363 --> 03:44:44.223]  Oh, thank you, sir.
[03:44:45.244 --> 03:44:45.884]  Yeah.
[03:44:46.344 --> 03:45:00.471]  I woke up today and turned on the news and immediately I'm assaulted with this whole, I don't know what day it was when they were having this back and forth, but apparently, you know, Trump was coming out and saying all these things about 9-11 and
[03:45:01.826 --> 03:45:13.934]  The, uh, talking about the video clips that they showed of, uh, you know, the jihadis basically laughing and, and, and cheering it on when, you know, across the way you see, you know, the events of 9-11 going on.
[03:45:14.875 --> 03:45:26.723]  And, you know, between him and Ben Carson, the back and the forth, and then, you know, Ben Carson basically, you know, uh, doing a 180 on what he said, it just seems to me like the whole Republican Party is just,
[03:45:28.681 --> 03:45:31.642]  It's just a total disinformation campaign now.
[03:45:32.062 --> 03:45:36.364]  And it's also, you know, it does a lot of damage to the 9-11 truth movement.
[03:45:37.164 --> 03:45:38.864]  I just want to know what your thoughts on that were.
[03:45:39.244 --> 03:45:47.387]  Well, when it comes to these political elections, especially presidents, I do agree, by and large, they're just political theater, for lack of a better term.
[03:45:47.747 --> 03:45:51.168]  These guys are going out there to entertain, they're trying to captivate the audience.
[03:45:51.528 --> 03:45:55.970]  I think a lot of it is they can get their focus groups together and just go out there and talk about what they think.
[03:45:56.730 --> 03:45:57.471]  People want to hear.
[03:45:57.851 --> 03:46:04.795]  So I think there is a lot of that going on as far as hurting the 9-11 truth movement.
[03:46:05.375 --> 03:46:14.641]  It may be so, but it also may direct people to sites like Architects and Engineers and some of the other reports and information that is out there that allow people to see the truth.
[03:46:14.661 --> 03:46:17.043]  Thank you so much for your call, Josh in Tennessee.
[03:46:17.463 --> 03:46:19.904]  Let's go on to Doug in, was that Minnesota?
[03:46:22.246 --> 03:46:23.767]  Hey, Jakari, how are you doing?
[03:46:23.827 --> 03:46:25.528]  Happy Thanksgiving to you guys.
[03:46:25.896 --> 03:46:26.436]  Well, thank you.
[03:46:26.476 --> 03:46:28.897]  Happy Thanksgiving to you.
[03:46:29.217 --> 03:46:30.218]  I'm from St.
[03:46:30.258 --> 03:46:31.298]  Cloud, Minnesota.
[03:46:31.838 --> 03:46:36.860]  We moved away for a while and came back, and it's not the same place, you might say.
[03:46:37.600 --> 03:46:49.005]  There's a lot of Muslims there now, and the city council and everybody really tries to cater a lot to them, including Tech High School.
[03:46:50.225 --> 03:46:53.266]  They allow them to use prayer in the gym.
[03:46:55.339 --> 03:46:56.480]  Our kids can't do it.
[03:46:57.100 --> 03:47:02.402]  And I thought that prayer was taken out of the schools, but they're allowed to do it.
[03:47:02.442 --> 03:47:04.643]  They said, well, that's their belief.
[03:47:04.723 --> 03:47:05.684]  That's their religion.
[03:47:06.084 --> 03:47:07.485]  Well, what happened to ours?
[03:47:08.145 --> 03:47:23.512]  And anytime a president takes better care of foreigners or terrorists, call them what you want, over the citizens and the people of the United States, that gets me to kind of question
[03:47:24.210 --> 03:47:31.735]  Is he really a president or is he setting up for his own little army and the takeover of the United States?
[03:47:32.756 --> 03:47:33.176]  You know?
[03:47:33.556 --> 03:47:34.977]  I mean, look at it.
[03:47:35.858 --> 03:47:44.643]  You know, you can't chase these guys down because it affects their constitutional rights for privacy.
[03:47:44.683 --> 03:47:45.504]  Well, wait a minute.
[03:47:46.024 --> 03:47:48.246]  You know, you're doing everything to the citizens.
[03:47:48.846 --> 03:47:51.728]  I think this country needs to just pound
[03:47:52.259 --> 03:48:00.846]  And pound their congressmen, their senators, call them every day, time and time again, and just hound them and hound them and say, you know what?
[03:48:01.667 --> 03:48:07.752]  You took an oath of office, you haven't been justified to your oath of office, it's time to go.
[03:48:08.612 --> 03:48:26.448]  Well, as far as your point, I was just going to interject, as far as your point of the kids in schools not being able to pray and kids being sent home because they have rosary beads and things of that nature, I do agree it is a very selective enforcement type of deal going on in the school system.
[03:48:26.468 --> 03:48:27.849]  Thank you so much for your call, Doug.
[03:48:27.869 --> 03:48:31.853]  We're going to move on very quickly before I break to Shane in Illinois.
[03:48:33.789 --> 03:48:34.189]  Yes, sir.
[03:48:34.649 --> 03:48:38.390]  I was trying to stay in contact with some friends of mine in Illinois.
[03:48:38.750 --> 03:48:48.152]  I mean, I work up in the North Dakota area, and I kind of weeded myself off the television, you know, just came up here to work and read and all that stuff.
[03:48:48.592 --> 03:48:55.854]  But, you know, you were saying that about Syria, that it's not being, it's not being played on the news right now, is that correct?
[03:48:56.574 --> 03:48:57.194]  As far as what?
[03:48:58.495 --> 03:49:00.155]  As far as the plane being shot down?
[03:49:01.581 --> 03:49:04.083]  Oh, that's in the news.
[03:49:04.143 --> 03:49:06.645]  I guess I'm not exactly sure what question you're asking.
[03:49:06.705 --> 03:49:07.025]  Okay.
[03:49:07.886 --> 03:49:24.258]  Well, the question, it's not necessarily a question as much as, you know, if they were not playing that, I thought I must have misheard that where the mainstream media, per se, is not reporting this as it is on the Internet.
[03:49:24.298 --> 03:49:31.083]  You know, this is a big deal as far as I can, especially when it comes to, like, biblical prophecy, and I don't mean to go that direction with it.
[03:49:32.612 --> 03:49:41.977]  There's a couple watermarks in the Bible that I keep watching for, and the one is when Damascus burns.
[03:49:42.197 --> 03:49:50.481]  Since Damascus has been created, Damascus has always existed, and here it is smoking right now.
[03:49:51.041 --> 03:49:58.845]  When Russia gets involved, they're actually pulled into the confrontation, as opposed to Russia just kind of mounting up.
[03:50:00.908 --> 03:50:04.311]  Being some kind of a thug, you know, some kind of a warlord thug.
[03:50:04.632 --> 03:50:06.654]  They actually get pulled into the confrontation.
[03:50:06.674 --> 03:50:09.737]  I kind of see that happening, you know, simultaneously right now.
[03:50:10.358 --> 03:50:16.023]  And if they weren't playing that in the Bible, I guess it wouldn't have been a question as much as the statement is.
[03:50:16.644 --> 03:50:24.752]  I think that as much as the Bible gets played out, almost to the T, that the media blacks it out.
[03:50:25.424 --> 03:50:25.805]  Yes, we're good.
[03:50:38.360 --> 03:50:43.543]  And I'm probably extending the timeline a little bit, but it's Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, right down to the refugees.
[03:50:43.563 --> 03:50:49.167]  Yeah, well, since the, um, since Obama said the red line and then backtracks a lot, you guys said the red line, not me.
[03:50:49.207 --> 03:50:50.548]  Like, no, you said it, Mr. President.
[03:50:50.728 --> 03:50:52.289]  Well, thank you so much for your call, Shane.
[03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:54.970]  I don't know if I answered your question, but at least you got to make your point.
[03:50:55.291 --> 03:50:55.691]  Stay tuned.
[03:50:55.711 --> 03:50:56.952]  We'll come back right after this break.
[03:50:56.972 --> 03:51:00.594]  We'll finish up with the callers and give you a preview of the InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:51:00.954 --> 03:51:03.736]  I'm Jakari Jackson hosting the InfoWars Overdrive Hour.
[03:51:10.680 --> 03:51:18.701]  My name is Don Whiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:19.402 --> 03:51:20.102]  What did I do?
[03:51:20.122 --> 03:51:28.183]  I created ExtendoVite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.
[03:51:28.803 --> 03:51:37.065]  For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available to you, so you don't have to suffer the same thing I did.
[03:51:37.765 --> 03:51:42.208]  Clean your blocked arteries and strengthen your heart and boost your natural immune system.
[03:51:42.949 --> 03:51:46.311]  I'm 60 years old now and I still work every day.
[03:51:46.611 --> 03:51:48.292]  To get your Xtendivite, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:48.312 --> 03:51:49.473]  That's 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.
[03:51:49.493 --> 03:51:52.515]  Xtendivite is only $69.95 for a 2-month supply of either capsules or liquid.
[03:52:04.648 --> 03:52:08.270]  Extend your life with ExtendoVite!
[03:52:34.548 --> 03:52:34.908]  I'm good.
[03:52:55.663 --> 03:53:00.265]  You're getting super high quality products at the lowest prices and you're getting free shipping.
[03:53:00.445 --> 03:53:02.246]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:53:02.466 --> 03:53:04.227]  Check it out today or call 888-253-3139.
[03:53:11.618 --> 03:53:15.859]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[03:53:16.259 --> 03:53:20.000]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[03:53:20.540 --> 03:53:21.801]  We typically do the same thing.
[03:53:21.921 --> 03:53:24.462]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[03:53:24.962 --> 03:53:26.582]  But have you considered heat storage?
[03:53:27.162 --> 03:53:28.963]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[03:53:29.363 --> 03:53:31.043]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[03:53:31.664 --> 03:53:33.024]  How will I keep my family warm?
[03:53:33.304 --> 03:53:35.745]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[03:53:35.785 --> 03:53:39.846]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[03:53:40.666 --> 03:53:41.387]  Another concern?
[03:53:41.787 --> 03:53:45.449]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[03:53:45.769 --> 03:53:48.030]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[03:53:48.350 --> 03:53:51.552]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[03:53:52.333 --> 03:53:54.774]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[03:53:55.134 --> 03:53:59.097]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[03:53:59.777 --> 03:54:01.118]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[03:54:01.798 --> 03:54:03.079]  FortressClothing.com.
[03:54:03.439 --> 03:54:04.780]  You'll never be cold again.
[03:54:13.706 --> 03:54:15.507]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:15.567 --> 03:54:18.069]  It is our final segment in this Overdrive Hour.
[03:54:18.149 --> 03:54:21.871]  Now, real quick, I want to remind you of our specials and the InfoWars shop.
[03:54:22.251 --> 03:54:34.598]  We are launching store-wide free shipping this Black Friday week only and launching deep discounts across the board on top-selling products, including Brain Force, which is 30% off, and also ProPure units that are 25% off.
[03:54:35.119 --> 03:54:39.601]  Now, before we go back to our calls, we have a clip of the situation that's going on with the Russian jet.
[03:54:39.881 --> 03:54:40.582]  Let's take a look at that.
[03:54:58.632 --> 03:55:05.955]  So if you're listening to this on the radio, it was a cut of the people getting ready.
[03:55:05.975 --> 03:55:14.317]  They had their missile system ready, and they fire at the helicopter that is trying to rescue the downed pilot, and they blow up the helicopter.
[03:55:14.337 --> 03:55:15.318]  So you can find all that.
[03:55:15.558 --> 03:55:17.939]  That's going to be on the InfoWars Nightly News tonight with David Knight.
[03:55:17.979 --> 03:55:19.999]  You guys can check that out at that time.
[03:55:20.019 --> 03:55:22.640]  We'll try to get to these last callers very quickly.
[03:55:22.700 --> 03:55:24.161]  We have Kim in Sweden.
[03:55:24.241 --> 03:55:24.561]  Go ahead.
[03:55:26.960 --> 03:55:27.180]  Yes.
[03:55:28.781 --> 03:55:29.522]  Yes, you are.
[03:55:29.542 --> 03:55:30.462]  It's a slight delay.
[03:55:30.562 --> 03:55:32.544]  What was your question or comment, Kim?
[03:55:58.567 --> 03:55:58.867]  Go ahead.
[03:56:00.248 --> 03:56:12.498]  Yeah, I think like the focus should be in first hand on like positive news and not so much on like negative news.
[03:56:15.461 --> 03:56:16.682]  Okay, anything else, Kim?
[03:56:18.069 --> 03:56:18.930]  Yeah, I love you.
[03:56:18.950 --> 03:56:21.352]  I hope I can call in more times.
[03:56:22.313 --> 03:56:28.639]  I wanted to say much, but it wasn't much to come out right now, so maybe next time it will be more that come out.
[03:56:28.719 --> 03:56:30.601]  But thanks so much for the call.
[03:56:30.721 --> 03:56:33.484]  Alright, thank you Kim.
[03:56:33.964 --> 03:56:35.165]  Thank you so much for your call.
[03:56:35.786 --> 03:56:40.710]  In the quick time we have left, I'm sorry to Dave, we may not get to you, but let's go to Bill in Ohio.
[03:56:40.750 --> 03:56:41.691]  He wants to talk about Hillary.
[03:56:41.731 --> 03:56:42.252]  Go ahead, Bill.
[03:56:43.078 --> 03:56:44.699]  Hey, I appreciate you putting me on here.
[03:56:46.160 --> 03:56:54.524]  I have a YouTube video of me confronting Hillary with a couple friends of mine at a book signing in Ohio in 2013.
[03:56:54.905 --> 03:56:58.127]  Okay, what's the... yeah, go ahead and throw that out.
[03:56:58.527 --> 03:57:06.431]  Yeah, if you go to YouTube and you put in, Marine veteran and friends confront Hillary at book signing.
[03:57:07.412 --> 03:57:09.433]  It's only 46 seconds long.
[03:57:10.299 --> 03:57:28.184]  And we were ushered out by the Secret Service, but I did this for a reason, to show people that you can confront this woman, and you're not going to get tased, you're not going to get thrown in jail, and I'm a United States Marine veteran, and I have a deep dislike for this woman on many levels.
[03:57:28.931 --> 03:57:36.874]  But the reason why I did that video is when we took the barricades down at the White House during the shutdown, I was one of the veterans that did that.
[03:57:37.555 --> 03:57:39.876]  And you guys were there filming at that time.
[03:57:40.416 --> 03:57:45.118]  And the more and more people I talked to, I kept telling them, Hillary's going to be the next problem.
[03:57:45.318 --> 03:57:46.859]  Hillary's going to be the next problem.
[03:57:47.479 --> 03:57:53.442]  But what was neat is you had seven rules that you could do before you ever got in there.
[03:57:53.462 --> 03:57:55.142]  And one of them was no recording devices.
[03:57:55.182 --> 03:57:56.663]  And you went through three checkpoints.
[03:57:57.575 --> 03:58:02.258]  I actually bought a watch with a hidden camera in it.
[03:58:02.518 --> 03:58:03.579]  That's very smart, Bill.
[03:58:03.619 --> 03:58:05.300]  I'm sorry, we have to jump to our next caller.
[03:58:05.841 --> 03:58:06.861]  Thank you so much for calling, Bill.
[03:58:07.222 --> 03:58:09.343]  Dave in California, you have about 40 seconds.
[03:58:09.383 --> 03:58:09.703]  Go ahead.
[03:58:11.044 --> 03:58:12.005]  Hi, this is Dave.
[03:58:12.065 --> 03:58:14.106]  I just love you guys, but I just wanted to get to the point.
[03:58:14.547 --> 03:58:20.951]  This Russian downed jet by Turkey is the doomsday scenario beginner.
[03:58:21.051 --> 03:58:21.812]  Right there, man.
[03:58:21.952 --> 03:58:23.793]  And as usual, the mainstream media
[03:58:24.369 --> 03:58:36.596]  Is covering a false flag Black Lives Matter attack to cover up the problem, the main problem that's really important in the world, which is the fact that a NATO, uh, NATO ally just downed a Russian jet.
[03:58:37.197 --> 03:58:39.218]  That is, that's what we've all been waiting for.
[03:58:39.498 --> 03:58:41.239]  Well, thank you so much David in California.
[03:58:41.259 --> 03:58:44.901]  I will agree there is somewhat of a despair in the news on all manner of topics, not just that.
[03:58:45.301 --> 03:58:48.023]  Stay tuned to InfoWars Nightly News tonight with David Knight.
[03:58:51.165 --> 03:58:52.746]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
