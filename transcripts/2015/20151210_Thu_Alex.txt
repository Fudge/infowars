[00:00:06.226 --> 00:00:07.548]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.548 --> 00:00:09.310]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.072]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.072 --> 00:00:12.654]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:14.196]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.196 --> 00:00:18.401]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:22.466]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:46.043]  There are a deluge of scientific polls out yesterday and today showing that the majority of American voters agree with Donald Trump saying, bar more Muslims coming into the country as migrants, as immigrants, both legal or illegal, or as refugees, until they've fixed the visa program and actually check the passports.
[00:00:46.923 --> 00:00:50.824]  So what is the Republican establishment and others going to do?
[00:00:50.824 --> 00:00:59.186]  Now, Rand Paul has come out with a piece basically supporting Trump, which I think is a good change, pointing out that it's Obama that should be stepping down.
[00:00:59.186 --> 00:01:05.888]  That it's Obama that's not qualified to be president, and certainly isn't the person who qualifies who can be president.
[00:01:05.888 --> 00:01:09.729]  We got a bunch of big guests today, but first a report from John Bowne.
[00:01:11.306 --> 00:01:16.809]  Obama and company would have us all believe that gun ownership must be heavily regulated.
[00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:23.232]  These comments stem from a fabricated culture of fear to be believed by our Big Daddy government.
[00:01:23.232 --> 00:01:24.433]  Sorry, kids.
[00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:27.895]  It turns out Big Daddy is a compulsive liar.
[00:01:27.895 --> 00:01:32.657]  As gun sales have gone up, gun violence has gone down.
[00:01:32.657 --> 00:01:35.499]  Well, unless you're counting Big Daddy's gun-free zones.
[00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:41.743]  Mother Jones Magazine did their best to attempt to point out that gun violence victims were increasing.
[00:01:41.743 --> 00:01:47.688]  Problem is, that data was gathered exclusively from gun-free zones.
[00:01:47.688 --> 00:02:01.177]  According to the Washington Post, in 1993, there were seven homicides by firearm for every 100,000 Americans, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
[00:02:01.177 --> 00:02:04.680]  By 2013, that figure had fallen by nearly half.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.745]  ...to 3.6, a total of 11,208 firearm homicides.
[00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:19.832]  The number of victims of crimes involving guns that did not result in death, such as robberies, declined even more precipitously, from 725 per 100,000 people in 1993 to 175 in 2013.
[00:02:19.832 --> 00:02:21.953]  In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in District of Columbia v. Heller
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.121]  It's not going to happen overnight.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.265]  Change cannot happen overnight, and the changes we seek won't always happen overnight.
[00:03:00.265 --> 00:03:04.370]  The economic challenges that we face weren't created overnight.
[00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.753]  They're not going to be solved overnight.
[00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:09.276]  A crisis this deep didn't happen overnight.
[00:03:09.276 --> 00:03:11.539]  Nothing worth doing happens overnight.
[00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:13.601]  We should not expect change to happen overnight.
[00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:14.803]  I don't think it's going to happen overnight.
[00:03:15.023 --> 00:03:20.569]  Regardless, the totalitarian left continues to threaten our Second Amendment rights.
[00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.956]  What these latest incidents in Colorado and now California raises two questions.
[00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:31.461]  One, are we mature enough as a country to look in the mirror and say we have a gun problem?
[00:03:31.981 --> 00:03:35.764]  You know, a 12-step program starts with, you gotta acknowledge you have a problem.
[00:03:35.764 --> 00:03:38.445]  Are we mature enough to acknowledge that?
[00:03:38.445 --> 00:03:43.789]  A treasonous shadow government shows their illegal hand by the very policies they set forth.
[00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:54.756]  Case in point, Obama begged from the Oval Office to administer an unconstitutional no-fly list while opening the floodgates for potential terrorists to enter the United States.
[00:03:54.756 --> 00:03:59.079]  As of 2013, the no-fly list included 47,000 people.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.546]  Up from 16 people after George W. Bush created it, American residents and U.S.
[00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:10.249]  veterans have routinely been put on the list by mistake.
[00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:15.795]  To begin with, Congress should act to make sure no one on a no-fly list is able to buy a gun.
[00:04:16.075 --> 00:04:27.923]  Today the ACLU was in a federal court arguing that people on the list cannot access the full evidence against them, receive a hearing, or cross-examine witnesses against them.
[00:04:27.923 --> 00:04:31.826]  Analysts are saying that the ACLU may actually win this thing.
[00:04:31.826 --> 00:04:36.810]  According to the rights granted by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, they already have.
[00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:43.594]  The lunacy behind the no-fly list should have put the Bush administration under the jail years ago.
[00:04:43.594 --> 00:04:45.476]  John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[00:04:50.257 --> 00:04:57.805]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a big Pew Research document out that the middle class is being destroyed at a record level, but that doesn't matter.
[00:04:57.805 --> 00:04:58.926]  They want to ban the word lynch.
[00:05:00.106 --> 00:05:08.711]  A recent hearing on climate change featuring three prominent scientists who are actually skeptical of man-made global warming resulted in a heated exchange.
[00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:25.121]  Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey invoked Galileo when he harped the science is settled, essentially calling climatologist Judith Curry a denier for believing that this could be something God made rather than something that is man-made and backed by science.
[00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:28.606]  Are you saying there's no natural variability, Senator?
[00:05:28.606 --> 00:05:31.129]  There were alligators at the North Pole.
[00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.850]  What was that?
[00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.493]  Was that you in your SUV?
[00:05:33.493 --> 00:05:37.659]  And be prepared for the climate change cult to be even more in your face.
[00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:41.464]  The UN announced the organization of a civil society PR campaign.
[00:05:42.005 --> 00:05:56.789]  This propaganda tsunami will be used to bolster the UN's climate deal, which calls for a $100 billion annual transfer from rich to poor nations, and of course taxes, penalties, and a global police force to guarantee our submission.
[00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.390]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.392]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:03.392 --> 00:06:11.635]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:06:11.635 --> 00:06:17.037]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:06:17.037 --> 00:06:19.578]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:33.121]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:06:33.121 --> 00:06:38.106]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of brain force.
[00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:41.409]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:44.892]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:06:44.892 --> 00:06:46.594]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:06:46.854 --> 00:06:47.795]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:06:47.795 --> 00:06:48.976]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:06:48.976 --> 00:06:50.957]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[00:07:02.767 --> 00:07:04.469]  Deep Cleanse by Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:05.109 --> 00:07:12.111]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[00:07:17.432 --> 00:07:26.395]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[00:07:26.855 --> 00:07:35.722]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[00:07:35.722 --> 00:07:42.827]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spite G-Rex herbal processing technique.
[00:07:42.827 --> 00:07:48.211]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you the best.
[00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:52.153]  No weapons of mass destruction were found.
[00:07:52.153 --> 00:07:52.974]  Are you kidding me?
[00:07:52.974 --> 00:07:53.694]  Do you buy that?
[00:07:53.694 --> 00:07:54.715]  There were, there were, there were!
[00:08:17.876 --> 00:08:22.820]  Come on, let's just shoot.
[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.481]  Flare.
[00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:23.861]  Flare.
[00:08:23.861 --> 00:08:28.065]  Hey, I need to get the raft, the raft, the drop raft.
[00:08:28.065 --> 00:08:32.528]  I got a wounded girl, we need to take the raft to Maya.
[00:08:32.528 --> 00:08:34.450]  Oh, it's their fault for bringing their gun.
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.261]  The main reason we went into Iraq at the time was we thought he had weapons of mass destruction.
[00:08:43.261 --> 00:08:46.502]  It turns out he didn't, but he had the capacity to make weapons of mass destruction.
[00:08:46.502 --> 00:08:49.243]  But I also talked about the human suffering in Iraq.
[00:08:49.243 --> 00:08:51.504]  Hello, boys and girls.
[00:08:51.504 --> 00:08:55.485]  I have a special message for you from the President of the United States.
[00:08:55.485 --> 00:09:05.308]  I salute the boys and girls who are buying United States savings stamps and bonds, and they're giving important support to the cause of freedom and the men who fight for us in Vietnam.
[00:09:10.003 --> 00:09:23.731]  As an American citizen, you have to respect our president whether I like it or not.
[00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:29.094]  It's really not my decision, but I do respect my president and I will support whatever decision he makes.
[00:09:42.345 --> 00:09:44.887]  It is a hard fact that U.S.
[00:09:44.887 --> 00:09:50.111]  strikes have resulted in civilian casualties.
[00:09:50.111 --> 00:09:54.954]  Now he's gone, I don't know why.
[00:09:54.954 --> 00:09:58.457]  Until this day, sometimes I cry.
[00:09:58.457 --> 00:10:03.481]  He didn't even say goodbye, he didn't take the time.
[00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:10.047]  The United States knows that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.
[00:10:10.047 --> 00:10:14.469]  One of the first things they told me was, you're not even to acknowledge the drone program.
[00:10:14.469 --> 00:10:17.329]  You're not even to discuss that it exists.
[00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:33.134]  Renewed hostile actions against United States ships on the high seas and the Gulf of Tonkin have today required me to order the military forces of the United States to take action and reply.
[00:10:34.654 --> 00:10:40.615]  That reply is... Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:10:40.615 --> 00:10:45.816]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:10:45.816 --> 00:10:55.659]  That's right, it's Alex Jones Live, is the 19-year-old name of the syndicated radio broadcast, been on air 21 years basically, but 19 years syndicated.
[00:10:55.659 --> 00:11:01.020]  But that's because stations like you to call it the Alex Jones Show so that people could fill out their little arbitron.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.882]  Booklets, and people knew what show they were listening to, but as the media has evolved, really this is just InfoWars Live.
[00:11:08.882 --> 00:11:20.465]  This is the big, live, four-hour radio-slash-TV broadcast that is reaching more than 20 million people a week now, worldwide, and it's bigger than Alex Jones.
[00:11:20.465 --> 00:11:29.208]  It's bigger than Jakari Jackson, or Darren McBreen, or Rob Doo, or Leigh-Anne McAdoo, or all the other great reporters and crew, like David Knight and countless others.
[00:11:30.894 --> 00:11:49.369]  It's about you, the viewers, you, the listeners, and the photos you send us, the articles you send us, the tips you send us, the feedback you give us, and the friends and family and neighbors and colleagues and random strangers that you tell about the broadcast.
[00:11:49.369 --> 00:11:51.410]  You are the resistance.
[00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:55.994]  That's why we have so many contests, at least 10 a year, and I want to have more.
[00:11:57.213 --> 00:12:16.966]  We've done two the last week with quick turnarounds and announced the winners, where we showcase people out there that are listeners and their own analysis of the President's draconian anti-gun, anti-due process speech Sunday, illustrating the power of the people.
[00:12:16.966 --> 00:12:23.131]  And the two winning videos, the winner and the runner-up, were as good as anything I could say.
[00:12:23.131 --> 00:12:25.352]  They were as good as anything my crew would do.
[00:12:25.352 --> 00:12:26.313]  It was excellent.
[00:12:28.666 --> 00:12:31.867]  And we had another contest about the attack on Christmas.
[00:12:31.867 --> 00:12:32.847]  The war on Christmas.
[00:12:32.847 --> 00:12:35.428]  It was a two-day turnaround.
[00:12:35.428 --> 00:12:40.209]  Hundreds of great submissions that we were able to put out on Facebook and Twitter, reaching millions of people.
[00:12:40.209 --> 00:12:44.691]  One of the memes alone reached like 300,000 people on Facebook.
[00:12:44.691 --> 00:12:47.272]  We could see the numbers.
[00:12:47.272 --> 00:12:48.512]  And that's you taking action.
[00:12:48.512 --> 00:12:55.314]  And it's about illustrating that you are important, you are the fount, the baseline of the resistance.
[00:12:56.877 --> 00:13:00.898]  And the change does come from the grassroots up, and that we are not astroturf.
[00:13:00.898 --> 00:13:03.519]  We are humans that want to be free.
[00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:05.660]  We are Christians.
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.001]  We are agnostics.
[00:13:07.001 --> 00:13:07.781]  We are northerners.
[00:13:07.781 --> 00:13:08.821]  We are southerners.
[00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:09.541]  There are Muslims.
[00:13:09.541 --> 00:13:11.222]  There are Jews.
[00:13:11.222 --> 00:13:11.722]  You name it.
[00:13:11.722 --> 00:13:16.984]  And I do know atheists out there that don't like the New World Order and don't want to be slaves as well.
[00:13:16.984 --> 00:13:20.305]  And look, we all have differences, but at the end of the day, we're not criminals.
[00:13:20.305 --> 00:13:22.106]  We don't want to feed on innocent people.
[00:13:22.106 --> 00:13:24.907]  We don't want to live under an unelected, worldwide tyranny.
[00:13:26.169 --> 00:13:29.151]  That they've tried to deny they were setting up for decades.
[00:13:29.151 --> 00:13:31.352]  Now that it's here, they don't deny it.
[00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:32.873]  They say, you will be assimilated.
[00:13:32.873 --> 00:13:33.394]  Submit.
[00:13:33.394 --> 00:13:34.815]  Well, I'm not submitting.
[00:13:34.815 --> 00:13:37.416]  I'm not laying down in the dirt.
[00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:42.340]  I'm taking action.
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:50.085]  But last week when we had Donald Trump on, we have one of his chief advisors on for an hour and a half today, Roger Stone, former
[00:13:52.233 --> 00:13:56.738]  campaign head of his exploratory committee four years ago and then earlier this year.
[00:13:58.012 --> 00:14:03.414]  He'll be joining us for an hour and a half to get into not just Donald Trump, but where the whole country and the world's going.
[00:14:03.414 --> 00:14:05.395]  And he's run major U.S.
[00:14:05.395 --> 00:14:13.559]  operations in third world countries and other nations to try to get pro-U.S., pro-constitutional, pro-free market people elected.
[00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:16.540]  So he knows what he's talking about when he gets into elections.
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:24.524]  We're going to be really going over all of this and different strategies, not just to get Donald Trump in or another constitutionalist patriot type.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:33.484]  But to win at the state level, you name it, and where he sees the trends going for this country.
[00:14:33.484 --> 00:14:38.687]  But last week, you know, Jakari Jackson said, well, congratulations getting Donald Trump on.
[00:14:38.687 --> 00:14:39.808]  That's really good for you.
[00:14:39.808 --> 00:14:42.710]  And I said, no, Jakari, congratulations to you.
[00:14:43.835 --> 00:14:55.019]  And to everybody else in the Infowars operation and to the listeners and everyone, because Donald Trump isn't God, he's not the end-all be-all, he makes mistakes, but he is a true maverick.
[00:14:55.019 --> 00:15:00.501]  The point is that a Matt Drudge would travel here to see us when he doesn't give anybody else interviews.
[00:15:05.134 --> 00:15:10.738]  Donald Trump comes on this show knowing full well that it would be controversial and they would attack him for it.
[00:15:10.738 --> 00:15:13.360]  What does it signify and so many other issues?
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.923]  That the mainstream media isn't the mainstream media anymore.
[00:15:16.923 --> 00:15:26.530]  They are the dead dinosaur fossilized Decepticon media and the only answer is thumbing our nose at them.
[00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:34.457]  The only answer is treating them with disdain and announcing them by the ancient name of enemy.
[00:15:34.457 --> 00:15:34.777]  Enemy!
[00:15:36.294 --> 00:15:37.674]  See how you like that?
[00:15:37.674 --> 00:15:41.815]  We're not going to respond by being intimidated by you, by groveling to you.
[00:15:41.815 --> 00:15:43.555]  So many of these politicians don't get it.
[00:15:43.555 --> 00:15:45.356]  They don't understand it.
[00:15:45.356 --> 00:15:53.097]  This is about a revolution of not being cowed, of standing up, of being informed, and getting in the globalist faces.
[00:15:53.097 --> 00:15:56.858]  Because we've gotten in this position by behaving like servile sheep.
[00:15:56.858 --> 00:16:01.279]  You know, they twist the Bible so much.
[00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:05.840]  The entire Bible is people standing up against tyrants, defeating them, or being killed in the process.
[00:16:07.489 --> 00:16:08.750]  Tortured, you name it.
[00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:12.453]  But then to Christ we are to be as sheep.
[00:16:12.453 --> 00:16:17.497]  To God we are to be as sheep, not waging war against God and God's plan.
[00:16:17.497 --> 00:16:22.902]  But we are to resist until the end and wage war against the world's plan.
[00:16:23.951 --> 00:16:24.972]  Well, they've turned that around.
[00:16:24.972 --> 00:16:34.957]  These churches, they go, be like little sheepies, and the Lord wants you to do whatever the government says or whatever a bully says, because that's what the Lord said.
[00:16:34.957 --> 00:16:43.402]  Oh, the Lord beat the money changers in the temple who had been saying they wanted to kill him with a
[00:16:45.202 --> 00:16:53.485]  Cat or Ninetail basically, a multi-ended whip and overturned tables and basically you can read the three gospels, beat a bunch of people up.
[00:16:53.485 --> 00:16:59.707]  He went on a rampage and beat up about 25 people.
[00:16:59.707 --> 00:17:01.048]  Is that very Lamb-like?
[00:17:02.762 --> 00:17:05.124]  No, he was illustrating this is the enemy.
[00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:10.029]  Not the prostitutes, not even the tax collectors, not the corrupt Roman police.
[00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:23.562]  The problem was those claiming they represented God sitting in front of the temple making people go buy a special coin for about, depending on the era, ten times what it was worth to pay for a sacrifice.
[00:17:26.015 --> 00:17:28.436]  They wouldn't let him pay with general coin.
[00:17:28.436 --> 00:17:36.857]  They made him buy a special rare coin and it was basically money manipulation.
[00:17:36.857 --> 00:17:46.479]  And so Christ came in and overturned the tables and beat them with a whip and basically kicked them physically.
[00:17:46.479 --> 00:17:47.239]  Boom!
[00:17:47.239 --> 00:17:49.000]  Kicking them out.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:49.660]  Ran them out.
[00:17:52.918 --> 00:18:00.962]  Some accounts are he beat up more like 50 plus people, and it was a large group of men, the money changers, that he beat up.
[00:18:00.962 --> 00:18:05.265]  Jesus Christ beat them up, all of them.
[00:18:05.265 --> 00:18:09.827]  And that's, that's how, we're supposed to be Christ-like, right?
[00:18:09.827 --> 00:18:18.352]  See, Christ knew when to hold them, knew when to fold them, knew when to walk away, knew when to run, and knew when to not run, when it was time for him to make the ultimate sacrifice.
[00:18:23.806 --> 00:18:26.347]  And his flesh didn't want to do it.
[00:18:26.347 --> 00:18:27.267]  In the garden, did it?
[00:18:27.267 --> 00:18:31.369]  He said, please take this bitter cup away.
[00:18:31.369 --> 00:18:35.390]  Envisioning all the beating, the torturing he's going to go through over the next couple days.
[00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:39.372]  But then his spirit stood him right back up.
[00:18:39.372 --> 00:18:42.653]  Spirit of the Father, and he walked out to do his duty.
[00:18:42.653 --> 00:18:47.775]  And it's the spirit animating flesh that is going to save this planet.
[00:18:47.775 --> 00:18:50.496]  It's not going to be the world, it's not going to be super science.
[00:18:52.042 --> 00:18:54.803]  Those are all great gifts God's given us with our minds.
[00:18:54.803 --> 00:18:55.804]  It's going to be the Spirit.
[00:18:55.804 --> 00:18:57.564]  I don't mean to go off into preaching today.
[00:18:57.564 --> 00:19:01.386]  When I come back, I promise I'm going to control myself.
[00:19:01.386 --> 00:19:09.389]  And I'm going to go over all of the huge, and I say huge, I've got to get to this economic news, I've got to get to the military news, I've got to get to the internet censorship news.
[00:19:09.389 --> 00:19:16.452]  But obviously first, because it's a free speech issue, it's a major political issue, it's a war between old media and new media issue.
[00:19:19.363 --> 00:19:29.771]  But the attempted political assassination of Donald Trump and the legions of cowards, on the left and the right, lining up to beat their chest.
[00:19:29.771 --> 00:19:37.396]  And look at the man in the arena, the gladiator, outnumbered 10 to 1, defeating the enemy, and to say, that's the bad man.
[00:19:37.396 --> 00:19:38.377]  Oh, we're better than him.
[00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:41.059]  He's a bigot.
[00:19:41.059 --> 00:19:45.782]  But you notice the American people and major polls agree with him.
[00:19:45.782 --> 00:19:47.664]  So we're going to break it all down straight ahead.
[00:19:49.116 --> 00:19:55.510]  On the other side of this break, you're listening and watching the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.516]  It is the InfoWar, live and worldwide.
[00:20:00.242 --> 00:20:03.543]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[00:20:03.543 --> 00:20:09.045]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[00:20:09.045 --> 00:20:11.306]  But they're about to lose control.
[00:20:11.306 --> 00:20:16.627]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart, in ways you never imagined.
[00:20:16.627 --> 00:20:21.089]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:20:21.209 --> 00:20:23.610]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:27.453]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[00:20:27.453 --> 00:20:31.976]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[00:20:31.976 --> 00:20:35.097]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:20:35.097 --> 00:20:37.699]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:20:37.699 --> 00:20:39.040]  This will affect us all.
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:44.265]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[00:20:44.265 --> 00:20:50.672]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.

[00:21:00.458 --> 00:21:11.349]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[00:21:11.349 --> 00:21:15.514]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[00:21:15.514 --> 00:21:17.676]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[00:21:17.676 --> 00:21:23.142]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[00:21:23.302 --> 00:21:33.332]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[00:21:33.332 --> 00:21:39.838]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[00:21:39.838 --> 00:21:43.161]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[00:21:43.161 --> 00:21:45.243]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[00:21:45.243 --> 00:21:48.166]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[00:21:48.346 --> 00:21:49.668]  Heart and body extract.

[00:22:33.823 --> 00:22:37.066]  Safes can't be accessed quickly and racks are unsafe for children.
[00:22:37.066 --> 00:22:39.648]  Covert Cabinets are the next level in home defense.

[00:23:02.187 --> 00:23:03.949]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?

[00:23:23.889 --> 00:23:24.069]  That's 877-886-3653.
[00:23:45.623 --> 00:23:46.825]  Welcome back.
[00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:48.427]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:06.405 --> 00:24:22.315]  Coming up at the bottom of the second hour, we're going to have a presidential advisor to nine administrations, Roger Stone, joining us via video Skype.
[00:24:22.315 --> 00:24:27.178]  Pretty much Trump's top advisor, one of his top advisors.
[00:24:27.178 --> 00:24:32.621]  Will be joining us to talk all things Planet Trump and election 2016.
[00:24:32.621 --> 00:24:35.303]  And then in a couple weeks, he's going to be in the studio with us again.
[00:24:36.409 --> 00:24:46.995]  Really impressive that he's been able to get on Discovery Channel, History Channel, Bill Maher, CNN, Fox News, you name it, basically laying out what Trump really wants to do.
[00:24:46.995 --> 00:24:52.478]  And so he'll give us the long-form inside baseball interview coming up in about an hour and five minutes from now.
[00:24:54.818 --> 00:25:03.584]  Also, we're going to get some guests on in the next few weeks, professors and others, going over the fact that gun crime is continuing to plunge since 1992.
[00:25:03.584 --> 00:25:07.326]  Now it's over 60 percent, I've been corrected, not 50 plus.
[00:25:07.326 --> 00:25:12.430]  The only thing that's up is gun-free zone, victim disarmament zones.
[00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:21.056]  And that's up, depending on which number you look at, 25 percent or more in the last decade because they advertise, you know, crazies go do this.
[00:25:23.203 --> 00:25:28.972]  Just like when they advertise death by cop, where you go pull a gun on a cop and people then go do it right after that happens.
[00:25:28.972 --> 00:25:31.896]  The more you cover it, the more it happens.
[00:25:31.896 --> 00:25:37.765]  That's why Trump's come out and said don't give these terrorists attention, don't call them heroes, you know, don't have the media make it sexy.
[00:25:39.502 --> 00:25:40.423]  That's what contributes.
[00:25:40.423 --> 00:25:45.588]  Well, back in the 70s, we had real terror in this country that left us blowing stuff up on almost a weekly basis.
[00:25:45.588 --> 00:25:53.877]  And the way they went away was to stop giving them attention and to stop negotiating with them and to stop giving them ransoms like they did in the 60s.
[00:25:53.877 --> 00:25:58.182]  It ended in a few years.
[00:25:58.182 --> 00:25:59.303]  So that's some of what's coming.
[00:26:01.011 --> 00:26:04.834]  up, but they are really spending this big time.
[00:26:04.834 --> 00:26:13.059]  And we've had Professor Lott and others on saying the new assault on our guns was coming, our right to self-defense, and that they would use fake statistics to do it.
[00:26:13.059 --> 00:26:18.923]  Bloomberg is literally already spent $500 million in the last few years on anti-gun initiatives.
[00:26:18.923 --> 00:26:23.846]  They're talking about spending even more on fake statistics.
[00:26:23.846 --> 00:26:28.229]  Jerry Falwell's Liberty University to allow guns in dorms, that is going to be a great idea.
[00:26:29.335 --> 00:26:33.756]  Criminals are just going to bring guns anyways.
[00:26:33.756 --> 00:26:43.058]  And by the way, when my dad was in high school, he used to bring a shotgun with him because he'd go hunting with friends after school.
[00:26:43.058 --> 00:26:45.439]  And he was in a rural school, but it was a big one.
[00:26:45.439 --> 00:26:50.900]  But folks will tell you, just 30 years ago in New York City, they had shooting clubs in high schools.
[00:26:52.389 --> 00:26:55.810]  It's not the person that brings a rifle to school that kills everybody.
[00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:57.371]  It's not the rifle that did it.
[00:26:57.371 --> 00:27:00.631]  It's that a criminal's gonna bring a gun, a crazy's gonna bring a gun, regardless.
[00:27:00.631 --> 00:27:07.314]  And I know that our audience already knows this.
[00:27:07.314 --> 00:27:09.834]  But they can show you a limited graph.
[00:27:09.834 --> 00:27:12.855]  One of the rarest forms of death by gun is a mass shooting.
[00:27:12.855 --> 00:27:14.516]  In fact, it's the most rare.
[00:27:14.516 --> 00:27:16.276]  And they can show that up.
[00:27:16.276 --> 00:27:20.217]  But overall, guns killing people is down.
[00:27:20.217 --> 00:27:21.278]  Even criminals, it's down.
[00:27:21.278 --> 00:27:21.658]  You know why?
[00:27:22.722 --> 00:27:25.083]  Because they always add those to the 12,000 number every year.
[00:27:25.083 --> 00:27:26.164]  Suicides, you name it.
[00:27:26.164 --> 00:27:35.008]  Criminals aren't doing as many home invasions or carjackings nationwide, because even in places like Chicago and New York and D.C., people are just packing illegally now.
[00:27:35.008 --> 00:27:38.329]  Law-abiding citizens realize the system's against them now.
[00:27:38.329 --> 00:27:39.490]  They're not going along with it.
[00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:42.731]  I didn't mean to go off into guns.
[00:27:42.731 --> 00:27:46.313]  It's just, it's such a big deal that they're trying to deceive the public.
[00:27:47.372 --> 00:27:57.759]  Now, a large minority of Americans of every race, color, and creed and religion have gotten guns, have gotten the security, are using it, know the facts.
[00:27:57.759 --> 00:28:01.461]  The one area we're losing isn't even in the opinion for guns.
[00:28:01.461 --> 00:28:04.463]  That's more positive now than negative for the first time in decades.
[00:28:04.463 --> 00:28:05.124]  You can look that up.
[00:28:07.321 --> 00:28:13.782]  But with a majority of people, even though they're still pro-gun, they believe gun crime is up.
[00:28:13.782 --> 00:28:20.244]  They've got Pew Research, Mason Dixon, Zogby, Fox polls, New York Times polls, LA Times polls.
[00:28:20.244 --> 00:28:24.925]  You can just type in, gun crime down, public thinks it's way up.
[00:28:24.925 --> 00:28:27.805]  You'll get articles from the Washington Post, LA Times, you name it.
[00:28:27.805 --> 00:28:29.426]  They even admit this.
[00:28:29.426 --> 00:28:31.646]  And it's a triumph of ignorance.
[00:28:31.646 --> 00:28:33.166]  Now I'll tell you, it backfired on them.
[00:28:33.166 --> 00:28:35.947]  People think there's so much killing and so much murder going on,
[00:28:36.826 --> 00:28:48.095]  That they are running out and buying guns to then protect themselves because they think there's more crime and they want to protect themselves when there's not.
[00:28:48.095 --> 00:28:53.079]  So it shows how propaganda can backfire sometimes because they ask people, why'd you buy a gun?
[00:28:53.079 --> 00:28:58.023]  Well, because of the crime epidemic and because of the home invasion epidemic and everything.
[00:28:58.023 --> 00:29:02.046]  And that's because the media covers all that because if it bleeds, it leads.
[00:29:03.061 --> 00:29:12.443]  And so again it creates a perception there's all this crime and all these guns and so folks want to have an equalizer so they go out and they buy guns to protect themselves from the criminals.
[00:29:13.595 --> 00:29:19.517]  But the false belief is actually having a positive effect, because we would have seen a crime rate explosion.
[00:29:19.517 --> 00:29:25.179]  We've seen an increase in some areas a little bit, but it's still overall down, because the economy's in the crapper.
[00:29:25.179 --> 00:29:29.340]  We've got criminal immigrants, a percentage of them, pouring in from all over the world.
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.360]  Criminals being thrown out of their countries or running.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:36.422]  They're all coming here from Germany to Mexico, you know, from South Africa to Japan.
[00:29:36.422 --> 00:29:37.742]  You name it, they're coming here.
[00:29:37.742 --> 00:29:39.463]  This is the happy hunting ground.
[00:29:39.463 --> 00:29:42.464]  But they're afraid to do violent crimes because they get their butt shot off.
[00:29:43.244 --> 00:29:44.826]  A lot of petty crime?
[00:29:44.826 --> 00:29:45.927]  Snatching grabs?
[00:29:45.927 --> 00:29:49.410]  That's all up, by the way.
[00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:50.812]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.812 --> 00:29:53.334]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.334 --> 00:29:56.037]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.655 --> 00:30:05.556]  Retired basketballer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is calling Trump the ISIS candidate.
[00:30:05.556 --> 00:30:13.098]  He says the GOP frontrunner is doing ISIS's work for them by preying on people's understandable fear to coerce support.
[00:30:13.098 --> 00:30:20.559]  According to Abdul-Jabbar, Trump's political stance might make people transcend abstraction and actually commit acts of violence.
[00:30:20.559 --> 00:30:25.460]  He fails to point out, though, the countless people on the left calling for violence against Trump.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:40.412]  Now, naturally, there's been no condemnation against this violent and hateful rhetoric, probably claiming it's justified because of Trump's crazy talk calling to temporarily halt Muslims from entering the country until the vetting process is fixed.
[00:30:40.412 --> 00:30:49.220]  Hillary calls this un-American and against our values, ignoring that this same policy was enacted by Jimmy Carter during the Iran-Contra scandal.
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.303]  Iranians were banned from entering the U.S.
[00:30:52.303 --> 00:30:55.347]  unless they opposed the Shiite Islamist regime.
[00:30:55.347 --> 00:30:57.970]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com

[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.501]  And the word is getting out.
[00:31:12.501 --> 00:31:14.582]  The globalists want to make us dependent.
[00:31:14.582 --> 00:31:18.325]  And as Napoleon famously said, an army marches on its stomach.
[00:31:18.325 --> 00:31:23.809]  Ammunition, food, and supplies form the backbone of any offensive, including the Info War.
[00:31:23.809 --> 00:31:26.731]  And our enemies admit they're losing the Info War.
[00:31:27.011 --> 00:31:30.753]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:31:30.753 --> 00:31:37.258]  With this in mind, we have held strong to our principles and the decision to refuse any money from globalists or government.

[00:33:44.705 --> 00:33:49.726]  A holiday to Valhalla.
[00:33:49.726 --> 00:33:53.408]  You can't make this up, it just broke at Infowars.com.
[00:33:53.408 --> 00:33:56.549]  El Chapo reportedly threatens ISIS over drug trade.
[00:33:57.799 --> 00:34:02.682]  And I can't really read his email, his encrypted email that has been captured and now released.
[00:34:02.682 --> 00:34:12.129]  The leader of Mexico's deadliest drug cartel, El Chapo Guzman, reportedly threatened ISIS after its militants destroyed one of his shipments sent to the Middle East.
[00:34:12.129 --> 00:34:25.478]  El Chapo apparently wrote an encrypted email to ISIS leader Baghdadi, Al Baghdadi, threatening to destroy ISIS if they continue to interfere with the business of the Sinaloa cartel, according to Mexican blogger with strong ties to the cartel.
[00:34:26.863 --> 00:34:30.987]  You ISIS are not soldiers, you are nothing but lowly bleepies.
[00:34:30.987 --> 00:34:38.935]  The email stated, your God cannot save you from the true terror that my men will levy at you to continue to impact my operation.
[00:34:38.935 --> 00:34:41.878]  My men will destroy you, the world is not yours to dictate.
[00:34:41.878 --> 00:34:46.623]  I pity the next son of a whore that tries to interfere with the business of a similar cartel.
[00:34:46.623 --> 00:34:50.067]  I will have their heart and tongue torn from them, the email added.
[00:34:52.657 --> 00:35:00.946]  And of course that's El Chapo completely connected to the CIA and all these other groups for decades.
[00:35:00.946 --> 00:35:11.037]  And then of course they turned against him and burned a bunch of his people and then they came out in court and said we work for the CIA and declared their national security code names and they were all released of course in Chicago a few years ago.
[00:35:12.606 --> 00:35:13.967]  That's my problem with the drug war.
[00:35:13.967 --> 00:35:15.189]  It's so fake.
[00:35:15.189 --> 00:35:18.111]  I mean, the big banks run it, direct it, the government protects it.
[00:35:18.111 --> 00:35:21.374]  They bust low-level idiots that try to cut it on the trade.
[00:35:21.374 --> 00:35:23.136]  They even burn their own people.
[00:35:23.136 --> 00:35:29.042]  I mean, I'm just tired of it.
[00:35:29.042 --> 00:35:34.287]  And ISIS just is a ragtag group of idiots who no one has stood up to.
[00:35:35.469 --> 00:35:43.731]  And now that Russia is bombing the daylight side of them, and they're in a few months collapsing, Turkey and others are basically attacking the Russians, and now the U.S.
[00:35:43.731 --> 00:35:52.213]  has been bombing Syrian military bases, and directing al-Nusra, al-Qaeda, ISIS artillery.
[00:35:52.213 --> 00:36:00.775]  I mean, they give them tow missiles, artillery, and rocket launchers, and mortars, and then they give them GPS coordinate grid systems to aim them.
[00:36:02.691 --> 00:36:04.633]  They don't fully control them, then, because they tell them that.
[00:36:04.633 --> 00:36:10.738]  Don't, when you use the chemical weapons on Aleppo, don't video it and put it out.
[00:36:10.738 --> 00:36:11.579]  They don't listen.
[00:36:11.579 --> 00:36:22.688]  They load the big Saudi Arabian chemical weapon mortar up, you know, 70-pound mortar, launch it and scream, Allah Akbar, Allah Baghdadi, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:36:22.688 --> 00:36:27.052]  And that goes on, and then everybody goes, oh, this is your people launched the chemicals.
[00:36:28.169 --> 00:36:32.550]  And then Al-Nusra and Al-Qaeda and ISIS go on TV and go, yes we did!
[00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:33.311]  Ha ha ha!
[00:36:33.311 --> 00:36:37.932]  I mean, that's how stupid they are.
[00:36:37.932 --> 00:36:47.215]  As the West sends them in there twice with chemical weapons to blame Assad, and they want to be rock stars on the Internet, so they videotape themselves doing it.
[00:36:47.215 --> 00:36:49.476]  I mean, these really are a group of scum.
[00:36:49.476 --> 00:36:51.376]  They're not even good at what they do.
[00:36:51.376 --> 00:36:53.237]  And what does it say about us?
[00:36:57.381 --> 00:37:00.822]  That we have turned these people loose.
[00:37:00.822 --> 00:37:05.442]  And their real power isn't the 200 plus thousand fighters they've got.
[00:37:05.442 --> 00:37:13.924]  They bring behind them their women and their children who then take over the houses and the farms of the Muslims and Christians they've kicked out.
[00:37:13.924 --> 00:37:15.404]  And then they just won't leave.
[00:37:15.404 --> 00:37:24.666]  And then they squat in the houses and try to make the Syrian army, that's very small, but under attack from Turkey and others, fight them.
[00:37:24.666 --> 00:37:25.206]  House to house.
[00:37:27.273 --> 00:37:30.776]  So it's very despicable.
[00:37:30.776 --> 00:37:33.839]  We'll be getting to all of that here today.
[00:37:33.839 --> 00:37:37.142]  I'm going to get into Donald Trump now, here in just a moment.
[00:37:37.142 --> 00:37:45.570]  Then I'm going to open the phones up to get your take for first-time callers on this Thursday worldwide broadcast, the 10th day of December 2015.
[00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:47.451]  On where you think Trump's really going.
[00:37:47.451 --> 00:37:48.272]  Is Trump good?
[00:37:48.272 --> 00:37:48.973]  Is Trump bad?
[00:37:48.973 --> 00:37:50.394]  Do you trust him?
[00:37:50.394 --> 00:37:51.875]  What do you think of my views of Trump?
[00:37:51.875 --> 00:37:53.156]  I'll give that number out in a moment.
[00:37:53.156 --> 00:37:53.557]  Not yet.
[00:37:55.026 --> 00:38:00.249]  So I want you to comment on what I say and tell me if you agree or disagree.
[00:38:00.249 --> 00:38:05.151]  I'm going to have CJ, who's a really great engineer and technical guy, come in here and talk about this.
[00:38:05.151 --> 00:38:09.573]  And maybe tomorrow, Tim Fruge, because he's the guy that got this deal done.
[00:38:09.573 --> 00:38:20.079]  We go out to trade publications, because I'm no expert, and we go out and do our research, then we check on it, to try to bring people things that are truly game changers.
[00:38:20.079 --> 00:38:22.560]  It's like we did just sell out of the thousand
[00:38:23.814 --> 00:38:25.055]  We had to pay for a hundred of these.
[00:38:25.055 --> 00:38:26.135]  We had to pay for a hundred of these.
[00:38:54.582 --> 00:38:57.045]  And now the new system is in.
[00:38:57.045 --> 00:39:00.068]  That's the old system, and I was told it was sold out as of this morning.
[00:39:00.068 --> 00:39:04.012]  InfoWars Solar Base Station Power Supply.
[00:39:04.012 --> 00:39:05.093]  Now this is more heavy duty.
[00:39:05.093 --> 00:39:11.879]  This is the size of a larger suitcase, not a huge suitcase, but a medium-sized suitcase you'd roll through the airport.
[00:39:11.879 --> 00:39:13.901]  It's exactly the same with the wheels on it and everything.
[00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:15.930]  But it's even more sturdy.
[00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:19.772]  It's got the high quality, latest generation solar panels.
[00:39:19.772 --> 00:39:28.696]  We had this private labeled so that we could offer it, and I'm not exaggerating, for one half the leading competitor.
[00:39:28.696 --> 00:39:31.197]  You hear advertising all over talk radio.
[00:39:31.197 --> 00:39:37.939]  One half the leading competitor, and this has more power.
[00:39:37.939 --> 00:39:39.500]  This is better.
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.281]  Hands down, or I'd be selling the other one.
[00:39:42.398 --> 00:39:44.259]  I have before, years ago.
[00:39:44.259 --> 00:39:44.980]  Things get better.
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:46.040]  Things innovate.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.042]  This is the best type of solar panel, I'm told.
[00:39:48.042 --> 00:39:49.042]  Lasts longer.
[00:39:49.042 --> 00:39:51.324]  Is better.
[00:39:51.324 --> 00:39:52.224]  CJ knows all about it.
[00:39:52.224 --> 00:39:53.945]  I'm going to have him explain it.
[00:39:53.945 --> 00:39:57.128]  The point is you can read all the specs at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:39:57.128 --> 00:39:59.729]  InfoWars Solar Base Station Power Supply.
[00:39:59.729 --> 00:40:05.953]  You put this on your house, you put the battery supply and controls in your home, and you can power a ton of stuff with it.
[00:40:05.953 --> 00:40:10.076]  You buy three or four of these, you can run a pretty good size house on it.
[00:40:11.257 --> 00:40:16.604]  You can definitely run your hunting shack, your fishing shack, your fishing cabin, your emergency camp with this.
[00:40:16.604 --> 00:40:20.830]  I mean, this is really the latest cutting edge.
[00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:23.634]  And we've got 100 of them.
[00:40:23.634 --> 00:40:26.317]  And the small profit we make on each one will fund this operation.
[00:40:27.512 --> 00:40:39.938]  So, we did a lot of research, took us years, no exaggeration, basically cracked the whip around here for years to innovate, to get the latest cutting-edge stuff that's been out for a little while, been vetted, and proven to be good.
[00:40:39.938 --> 00:40:50.204]  We don't just take what just comes out, but what's been out for a year or so, what's been vetted, what has the best reviews, then we go buy a bunch of them, private label it, to then go to a new low price.
[00:40:51.004 --> 00:40:52.304]  It's called free market capitalism.
[00:40:52.304 --> 00:40:52.964]  We engage in it.
[00:40:52.964 --> 00:40:54.265]  We don't just preach it.
[00:40:54.265 --> 00:40:55.585]  We literally walk by it.
[00:40:55.585 --> 00:40:56.765]  We don't just talk the talk.
[00:40:56.765 --> 00:40:58.126]  We walk the walk.
[00:40:58.126 --> 00:40:58.986]  Big time.
[00:40:58.986 --> 00:41:01.226]  So M4 Solar Base Power Station.
[00:41:01.226 --> 00:41:04.707]  He'll pop in for five minutes right before our guest joins us next hour.
[00:41:04.707 --> 00:41:05.647]  CJ will be in studio.
[00:41:05.647 --> 00:41:08.428]  They're going to bring the unit in here to show you.
[00:41:08.428 --> 00:41:14.770]  And then if folks like it, we're going to start supplying these in the public at the most competitive prices out there.
[00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:16.050]  But reliable, high quality.
[00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:20.471]  It will last up to eight times longer than your typical unit.
[00:41:20.471 --> 00:41:26.133]  We back up all these statements at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:41:26.133 --> 00:41:36.816]  Lastly, we just promote and sell what we like to use, what we think is great, what we think is innovative, what we found to be game changers at the lowest prices we can with great service.
[00:41:38.288 --> 00:41:41.270]  We're running through December 18th.
[00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:43.591]  Free shipping, as everyone knows.
[00:41:43.591 --> 00:41:48.174]  But the specials for today, we're having daily specials from now until Christmas.

[00:41:55.999 --> 00:41:58.301]  Huge discount, and you're supporting the InfoWar.
[00:41:58.301 --> 00:41:59.562]  You couldn't ask for more, in my view.
[00:41:59.562 --> 00:42:00.242]  It's a total win.
[00:42:00.242 --> 00:42:00.822]  360 win.
[00:42:02.901 --> 00:42:15.289]  The Cleanse Pack, Deep Cleanse, Living Defense, Oxy Powder, 28% off retail and I'm going to have to stop offering that very soon because the Living Defense is about to sell out and so is Deep Cleanse.
[00:42:15.289 --> 00:42:22.494]  Winter Sun, Vitamin D, the highest quality, organic, concentrated, sublingual under the tongue, amazing.
[00:42:22.494 --> 00:42:27.398]  People get so sick during the winter, the main reason is they're not getting sun and your body then can't produce Vitamin D, folks.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:31.083]  Most of the stuff they sell, the synthetic crap, you can't absorb at the store.
[00:42:31.083 --> 00:42:31.784]  Look into it.
[00:42:31.784 --> 00:42:32.845]  This you can.
[00:42:32.845 --> 00:42:35.547]  Winter Sun Vitamin D, 350% off.
[00:42:35.547 --> 00:42:39.171]  Deep Cleanse, first sale ever on it, 17% off by itself.
[00:42:39.171 --> 00:42:49.501]  Wake Up A Friend Coffee Special, two bags of the highest quality, best tasting coffee I've ever tasted, that we private label out of Southern Mexico, Chiapas organic, high mountain, volcanic soil.
[00:42:50.482 --> 00:43:01.690]  From the villagers, beyond fair trade or free trade, direct trade with them, micro trade, InfoWarsStore.com and get a free InfoWars mug.
[00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:03.131]  And that says while supplies last.
[00:43:03.131 --> 00:43:07.874]  We've got more mugs, we've got coffee, so there's plenty of mugs.
[00:43:07.874 --> 00:43:09.015]  It's the coffee that's the issue.
[00:43:11.241 --> 00:43:13.702]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:13.702 --> 00:43:18.764]  And I cannot stress to you how big a deal it is when you do buy products from us.
[00:43:18.764 --> 00:43:20.885]  You see what we've built with your help.
[00:43:20.885 --> 00:43:21.825]  You see what we're doing.
[00:43:21.825 --> 00:43:26.668]  Our reporters all over the country, all over the world, breaking big news every couple days.
[00:43:26.668 --> 00:43:34.711]  Again, I use the word game changer because this is like a fumble in a sudden death overtime NFL Super Bowl game.
[00:43:36.991 --> 00:43:40.712]  The globalists are fumbling all the time, but used to there wasn't somebody there to point it out.
[00:43:40.712 --> 00:43:42.773]  The controlled globalist media would cover it up.
[00:43:42.773 --> 00:43:49.055]  We're there pointing out the screw-ups, pointing out when they lose possession of the ball.
[00:43:49.055 --> 00:43:57.217]  And quite frankly, InfoWars, other than Drudge, WorldNetDaily, and now Donald Trump, and RT, I just give credit where it's due.
[00:43:58.134 --> 00:44:01.357]  That's why they admit NATO wants RT banned and jammed in Europe.
[00:44:01.357 --> 00:44:04.220]  They've already basically got it kicked off most systems here in the US.
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:08.984]  They told RT two years ago, you have Alex Jones on anymore, we will take your license.
[00:44:08.984 --> 00:44:12.367]  They were actually visited by Homeland Security.
[00:44:12.367 --> 00:44:16.591]  And by the way, I can't tell you who else was visited by Homeland Security over a TV show.
[00:44:16.591 --> 00:44:17.112]  You know I've got
[00:44:18.407 --> 00:44:22.668]  Three shows on History and Discovery that are airing right now, where I'm basically the main host of them.
[00:44:22.668 --> 00:44:28.290]  They didn't pay me to do it, but I've interviewed for like four hours, and I'm in ten episodes as the main guy of all these different shows.
[00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:32.311]  I even forget all the names of them.
[00:44:32.311 --> 00:44:33.952]  People see them, I don't really watch a lot of TV, but...
[00:44:35.486 --> 00:44:42.372]  There was another very big popular show that I was on with somebody else, and they got visited by Homeland Security.
[00:44:42.372 --> 00:44:43.853]  They didn't just get attacked by Congress.
[00:44:43.853 --> 00:44:46.135]  They didn't just get demonized in the news.
[00:44:46.135 --> 00:44:48.337]  And it was over an episode I wrote.
[00:44:48.337 --> 00:44:54.422]  And by wrote, I mean that was the one episode out of scores I was in that I literally, 80% of it was me.
[00:44:54.422 --> 00:44:56.904]  What I would do, what I would show, what I would go interview.
[00:44:56.904 --> 00:44:59.326]  I'd interview this FBI guy, interview this person, you know.
[00:45:00.523 --> 00:45:03.604]  Go do this, go do that, and people are like, well, don't say this happened to us.
[00:45:03.604 --> 00:45:04.705]  People are scared.
[00:45:04.705 --> 00:45:05.605]  Yeah, I'd say so.
[00:45:05.605 --> 00:45:11.367]  I just want people to understand, this isn't a game.
[00:45:11.367 --> 00:45:13.208]  And I know you know that.
[00:45:13.208 --> 00:45:18.130]  But I tell my crew that, even though they're great, sometimes they go, hey, you're in a war.
[00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:19.290]  You're a big deal.
[00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:20.891]  You're effective.
[00:45:20.891 --> 00:45:22.311]  You're an important person.
[00:45:22.311 --> 00:45:23.932]  And you know, Matt Drudge has told me that.
[00:45:23.932 --> 00:45:29.434]  He's told countless other independent bloggers and journalists, you're just as important as the New York Times.
[00:45:30.509 --> 00:45:33.570]  Start thinking like that.
[00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:42.214]  There's this illusion that even though we're gigantic and reach 20 million people a week, there's no doubt now, worldwide total number of people
[00:45:44.853 --> 00:45:47.876]  I'm like three times bigger than Rush Limbaugh.
[00:45:47.876 --> 00:45:51.479]  In America, Rush Limbaugh is still bigger than Alex Jones.
[00:45:51.479 --> 00:45:53.320]  Quite frankly, I could care less.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.482]  I don't ever want him to retire.
[00:45:55.482 --> 00:45:57.143]  I don't ever want him to have a heart attack.
[00:45:57.143 --> 00:45:59.045]  I want him to be on the air 30 years from now.
[00:45:59.045 --> 00:46:00.566]  That's more targets for them to hit.
[00:46:00.566 --> 00:46:02.108]  They're coming after him first.
[00:46:02.108 --> 00:46:03.689]  Not me, probably.
[00:46:03.689 --> 00:46:05.150]  Already are.
[00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:08.033]  Even if I disagree with some of the stuff he says, he's a lot better than Hillary Clinton.
[00:46:08.882 --> 00:46:17.887]  I mean, I get the fact that there aren't many people at this level that I met, and there's an incredible kinship and incredible solidarity with people.
[00:46:17.887 --> 00:46:24.611]  I mean, I have solidarity with Glenn Beck, even though he hates me and attacks me still all the time, and says stuff about me that isn't true.
[00:46:24.611 --> 00:46:35.877]  I still can't help but want him to succeed, want him to do great, want him to really be successful, because we're overall fighting for the same thing, I think.
[00:46:38.266 --> 00:46:40.067]  Okay, enough inside baseball.
[00:46:40.067 --> 00:46:54.374]  It's just that if you want to fight the New World Order, spreading the word about this broadcast, buying our products, is the number one terrestrial thing, temporal thing, you can do.
[00:46:54.374 --> 00:46:58.736]  When it comes to blood and guts on the ground, boots on the ground, this is it.
[00:46:58.736 --> 00:47:00.537]  And believe me, I don't like being in that position.
[00:47:00.537 --> 00:47:02.658]  It is bracing.
[00:47:02.658 --> 00:47:04.860]  I wouldn't say frightening, but it's like jumping into cold water.
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:14.530]  When you really see what's going on and then you realize you're in the middle of it, it'll get your adrenaline going real quick.
[00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:17.555]  And then you look at zombies around you and think it's all funny and you get mad at them.
[00:47:18.763 --> 00:47:28.446]  Because, I mean, let me tell you, a tyrannical world government's getting set up right now, being openly announced, and it's anti-human, and it's anti-prosperity, and it wants to dominate you.
[00:47:28.446 --> 00:47:38.729]  Now, if you don't take that personal and get your hackles up, people always say, you know, that dog got his hackles up, that's when their fur puffs up around their neck because they're about to get in a fight, they don't want to get their arteries torn out of their neck.
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.982]  When the dog does that, it means it's getting ready to fight to the death.
[00:47:41.982 --> 00:47:44.705]  What do you think it is when you get chills?
[00:47:44.705 --> 00:47:46.387]  That's when we used to have more hair on us, folks.
[00:47:46.387 --> 00:47:49.970]  When I talk about this, my hair actually stands up.
[00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:53.794]  Because I'm having a physical response for death battle.
[00:47:53.794 --> 00:47:57.477]  I realize I'm in the presence of an enemy coming for me and my family.
[00:47:57.477 --> 00:47:59.599]  I realize all of our history's on the line.
[00:47:59.599 --> 00:48:02.162]  Everything!
[00:48:02.162 --> 00:48:02.262]  And...
[00:48:03.311 --> 00:48:06.952]  I can look at Donald Trump and see that he gets chills as well now when he talks about this stuff.
[00:48:06.952 --> 00:48:07.592]  Is he perfect?
[00:48:07.592 --> 00:48:08.333]  Is he worldly?
[00:48:08.333 --> 00:48:09.773]  Is he arrogant?
[00:48:09.773 --> 00:48:11.394]  Certainly.
[00:48:11.394 --> 00:48:12.794]  But we've been taught to hate men.
[00:48:12.794 --> 00:48:14.555]  We've been taught to hate confidence.
[00:48:14.555 --> 00:48:18.096]  We've been taught it's a bad thing because they don't want that in a trait in men.
[00:48:18.096 --> 00:48:20.237]  They don't want leaders.
[00:48:20.237 --> 00:48:20.837]  They don't want
[00:48:23.365 --> 00:48:27.068]  Bravado, machismo, any type of macho attitude.
[00:48:27.068 --> 00:48:31.693]  They just want people ready to roll over in a ditch and die.
[00:48:31.693 --> 00:48:34.175]  And I'm not going to be part of that.
[00:48:34.175 --> 00:48:35.836]  I'm not giving up on humanity.
[00:48:35.836 --> 00:48:37.338]  I'm not giving up on my children.
[00:48:37.338 --> 00:48:38.579]  I'm not giving up on you.
[00:48:38.579 --> 00:48:49.609]  And I watch Kareem Abdul-Jabbar say that Trump helps ISIS and quote, Trump is the ISIS candidate and Trump is horrible and Trump is racist and Trump is this and Trump is that.
[00:48:51.223 --> 00:49:17.434]  When Obama's run an operation to kill upwards of 300,000 Libyans, Syrians, and Egyptians, trying to put Al-Qaeda and other groups in charge, and is bombing these innocent people right now, and is bringing in radical Muslims to demonize Muslims in general, and a larger plan down the road for a clash of civilizations, and Donald Trump's saying, bomb the oil, stop ISIS, Turkey's involved, he's actually trying to do something.
[00:49:17.434 --> 00:49:20.135]  He's saying, don't let megabanks be tax-exempt.
[00:49:21.513 --> 00:49:23.514]  The Republicans and Democrats won't call for that.
[00:49:23.514 --> 00:49:25.396]  None of them!
[00:49:25.396 --> 00:49:29.738]  I started really looking at what Trump's doing other than his red meat rhetoric for the public.
[00:49:29.738 --> 00:49:33.221]  He's actually lining up policies that the establishment doesn't like.
[00:49:35.123 --> 00:49:36.924]  And that's why they're coming after Donald Trump.
[00:49:36.924 --> 00:49:55.931]  And then I see Rick Ross, not the real CIA drug dealer Rick Ross as a listener of the show, who I want to get on and get his response to next week, but the fake jail guard that was never a real hardened thug like he likes to act like, who likes to get up and prep kids to act like thugs to be put in the big prison complex that he used to work in.
[00:49:55.931 --> 00:50:01.874]  They admit at MTV, I talked to folks that were there in the 90s, that they were going to prep gangster rap to get all the young people into a
[00:50:02.794 --> 00:50:07.581]  Thug culture to prep you for prison, for your future life, your future job.
[00:50:07.581 --> 00:50:15.052]  And that's what Rick Ross is, a fake guy with no record who used to sit over black people all day in slave pits.
[00:50:15.052 --> 00:50:17.075]  And then he gets up with his fake name.
[00:50:18.237 --> 00:50:20.599]  Rick Ross, oh you're so hard!
[00:50:20.599 --> 00:50:25.503]  Stealing somebody's identity, and then saying you want to kill Donald Trump.
[00:50:25.503 --> 00:50:29.946]  And I guarantee he got authorizations from the highest levels of the Justice Department to do that.
[00:50:29.946 --> 00:50:31.828]  He said, I'm gonna kill him.
[00:50:31.828 --> 00:50:32.909]  I want him dead.
[00:50:32.909 --> 00:50:36.171]  And all these thousands of tweets saying, I'm serious, I'm gonna kill Donald Trump.
[00:50:36.171 --> 00:50:37.112]  And all this crap.
[00:50:37.112 --> 00:50:37.873]  Nobody getting in trouble.
[00:50:38.772 --> 00:50:47.074]  And to watch all these cowards line up, and Lindsey Graham, and all of them, all getting on the bandwagon, because they're followers.
[00:50:47.074 --> 00:50:48.515]  They're followers.
[00:50:48.515 --> 00:50:49.695]  They're followers.
[00:50:49.695 --> 00:50:50.555]  They're not leaders.
[00:50:50.555 --> 00:50:54.076]  So you gotta admire Trump, because he doesn't care what people think about him.
[00:50:54.076 --> 00:50:55.317]  He is a leader.
[00:50:55.317 --> 00:50:59.158]  And in a world of cowards, a man is something special, isn't it?
[00:51:02.711 --> 00:51:07.352]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[00:51:07.352 --> 00:51:11.633]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[00:51:11.633 --> 00:51:13.013]  We typically do the same thing.
[00:51:13.013 --> 00:51:16.053]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[00:51:16.053 --> 00:51:18.254]  But have you considered heat storage?
[00:51:18.254 --> 00:51:20.454]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[00:51:20.454 --> 00:51:22.754]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[00:51:22.754 --> 00:51:24.395]  How will I keep my family warm?
[00:51:24.395 --> 00:51:26.875]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[00:51:26.875 --> 00:51:30.936]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[00:51:31.756 --> 00:51:32.877]  Another concern?
[00:51:32.877 --> 00:51:36.860]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:39.442]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[00:51:39.442 --> 00:51:43.425]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[00:51:43.425 --> 00:51:46.227]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[00:51:46.227 --> 00:51:50.891]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[00:51:50.891 --> 00:51:52.892]  Don't get stuck in the cold.

[00:51:54.534 --> 00:51:55.875]  You'll never be cold again.
[00:51:59.673 --> 00:52:01.054]  Are you prepared to bug out?

[00:53:11.407 --> 00:53:15.013]  A Big Berkey Water Filter gives them protection from bacteria, heavy metals,
[00:53:15.293 --> 00:53:19.036]  Chlorine, fluoride, pesticides and herbicides, VOCs and more.
[00:53:19.036 --> 00:53:24.621]  And best of all, a big Berkey water filter is a gift that lasts for many years with no additional investment.

[00:53:55.363 --> 00:53:56.784]  Gift well this Christmas.
[00:53:56.784 --> 00:53:58.205]  Give a Big Berkey Water Filter!
[00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:10.913]  Second hour is about six minutes away.
[00:54:10.913 --> 00:54:14.014]  I really shouldn't have Johnny Cash songs like this as intro music.
[00:54:14.014 --> 00:54:15.055]  Ira Hayes.
[00:54:15.055 --> 00:54:17.376]  Because then I have trouble turning it off.
[00:54:17.376 --> 00:54:18.617]  Ira Hayes.
[00:54:18.617 --> 00:54:20.398]  Call him Drunken Iron Hayes.
[00:54:20.398 --> 00:54:24.159]  Call him Drunken Ira Hayes.
[00:54:24.159 --> 00:54:27.341]  He won't answer anymore.
[00:54:27.341 --> 00:54:33.264]  Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian, nor the Marine that went to war.
[00:54:33.264 --> 00:54:34.925]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:42.881]  We've added a fourth hour.
[00:54:42.881 --> 00:54:43.461]  11 a.m.
[00:54:43.461 --> 00:54:44.061]  to 3 p.m.
[00:54:44.061 --> 00:54:44.442]  now.
[00:54:44.442 --> 00:54:54.866]  Leanne McAdoo will be hosting, and she'll have a lot of breaking news analysis and info that she's in there working on right now.
[00:54:54.866 --> 00:55:02.250]  So, we have a new Pew study out, middle class declining, no longer a majority, and it's the smallest it's been in, really, U.S.
[00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:03.350]  history.
[00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:06.992]  And I could go over all that, the full story, the graphs, the reports, the numbers,
[00:55:08.857 --> 00:55:09.998]  It's a Breitbart story.
[00:55:09.998 --> 00:55:11.559]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:55:11.559 --> 00:55:16.202]  You can go see that for yourself.
[00:55:16.202 --> 00:55:17.763]  But, see, that's not the news.
[00:55:17.763 --> 00:55:30.692]  The news is, Donald Trump said, until we fix the border, until we screen these people, we've got to shut them all off because 25% in national polls, and new polls came out yesterday showing higher numbers and lower numbers, 21% and 27%.
[00:55:30.692 --> 00:55:33.014]  The point is, 25% on average saying they support suicide bombing.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:51.389]  There are polls today showing that, quote, the people coming out of Syria, these so-called refugees, 20 plus percent support ISIS or suicide bombing.
[00:55:51.389 --> 00:55:56.533]  And you know it's higher than that because you ask somebody in a poll, do you support suicide bombing?
[00:55:56.533 --> 00:55:58.935]  Oh yes, I support suicide bombing.
[00:55:58.935 --> 00:56:01.477]  I mean, you know it's more than the 25 percent.
[00:56:01.477 --> 00:56:04.740]  And I've got an article right here dealing with it.
[00:56:07.225 --> 00:56:13.708]  Underneath, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar saying he's helping ISIS and all the rest of this, that Donald Trump's bad.
[00:56:13.708 --> 00:56:14.228]  Report!
[00:56:14.228 --> 00:56:18.030]  Foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria more than doubled in the last 18 months.
[00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:22.572]  And then it goes into the UN, NATO, and others' own admissions.
[00:56:25.350 --> 00:56:26.970]  That's who's coming into the country.
[00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:29.311]  That's why they're all military-age men.
[00:56:29.311 --> 00:56:32.932]  And then after a while, large portions of these guys are former fighters.
[00:56:32.932 --> 00:56:35.273]  They decide after fighting a few years, they're done.
[00:56:35.273 --> 00:56:40.734]  And their payoff is going to Europe and raping whoever they want and getting free welfare.
[00:56:40.734 --> 00:56:46.616]  Literally!
[00:56:46.616 --> 00:56:52.518]  The London Guardian is reporting that number of foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria doubles in a year, report finds.
[00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:57.612]  And folks, you can believe it's probably worse than that.
[00:56:57.612 --> 00:57:04.076]  And then these guys are proud of themselves so they post the photos later on Facebook and then show them in Germany or Sweden or wherever.
[00:57:04.076 --> 00:57:07.218]  And you talk about the pushover domesticated Europeans or Americans.
[00:57:07.218 --> 00:57:11.661]  I mean, unless you're dealing with some good old boy or something, they literally fall down in fear to these people.
[00:57:11.661 --> 00:57:13.062]  And that's what the left says.
[00:57:13.062 --> 00:57:14.123]  Do whatever they say.
[00:57:14.123 --> 00:57:14.843]  Submit to them.
[00:57:14.843 --> 00:57:16.164]  They'll be nice to us.
[00:57:16.164 --> 00:57:18.606]  They'll blow stuff up if you don't do what they say.
[00:57:18.606 --> 00:57:19.946]  You need to be arrested.
[00:57:19.946 --> 00:57:22.488]  Do not say there is any radical Islam.
[00:57:22.488 --> 00:57:23.749]  I will wear a burqa.
[00:57:23.749 --> 00:57:24.790]  Sexually mutilate me.
[00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:27.772]  Allah Akbar!
[00:57:27.772 --> 00:57:29.193]  That is the left's response.
[00:57:29.193 --> 00:57:30.094]  White flag.
[00:57:30.094 --> 00:57:31.235]  Capitulation.
[00:57:31.235 --> 00:57:35.738]  Let's take conservative speech, because you're not submitting to the Jihad.
[00:57:35.738 --> 00:57:40.802]  And you're not letting a teacher five-year-old how to be transsexual, you bigots!
[00:57:40.802 --> 00:57:49.709]  Now, if you were throwing gay people off a building, ISIS, or cutting Catholic priests' heads off and eating their hearts, you'd be A-OK and sexy and cool on college campuses.
[00:57:49.709 --> 00:57:52.932]  But because you're not, you're a problem.
[00:57:52.932 --> 00:57:54.353]  And when you look at it in context,
[00:57:56.172 --> 00:58:00.619]  Ted Cruz is the only major Republican candidate to not run down Donald Trump now and turn against him.
[00:58:00.619 --> 00:58:09.051]  Then I saw something that, in a secret fundraiser with rich Republicans, he said, I might be scared of Donald Trump with his finger on the trigger.
[00:58:09.051 --> 00:58:09.973]  Who knows he even said that?
[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:14.342]  The point is Donald Trump is a loose cannon.
[00:58:14.342 --> 00:58:15.604]  That's what we need.
[00:58:15.604 --> 00:58:16.725]  Is he perfect?
[00:58:16.725 --> 00:58:17.245]  No.
[00:58:17.245 --> 00:58:18.426]  Do I trust him completely?
[00:58:18.426 --> 00:58:19.107]  No.
[00:58:19.107 --> 00:58:26.114]  The difference is the entire elite is against him and they're demonizing every little thing he says out of context, in context.
[00:58:26.114 --> 00:58:28.356]  He said some things I don't like, it doesn't matter.
[00:58:28.356 --> 00:58:35.704]  He's got them scared to death and he's a sign of the establishment in crisis and the coming restoration of our republic.
[00:58:36.024 --> 00:58:37.506]  We'll be back with the second hour.
[00:58:37.506 --> 00:58:38.547]  I'll give the phone number out.
[00:58:38.547 --> 00:58:38.787]  800-259-9231.
[00:58:38.787 --> 00:58:39.668]  First time callers.
[00:58:39.668 --> 00:58:39.708]  800-259-9231.
[00:58:49.952 --> 00:58:51.153]  I want more candy!
[00:58:51.153 --> 00:58:52.154]  I want more video games!
[00:58:52.154 --> 00:58:53.214]  Why, why, why?
[00:59:19.952 --> 00:59:20.712]  I think so.
[00:59:52.390 --> 01:00:03.101]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.101 --> 01:00:04.923]  We are on the march.
[01:00:04.923 --> 01:00:08.106]  The empire is on the run.
[01:00:08.106 --> 01:00:11.790]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.657 --> 01:00:32.164]  And I recognize that a great many folks in the media would prefer that anyone running for president engage in an ongoing, as an ongoing theater critic, criticizing the proposals of others.
[01:00:32.164 --> 01:00:34.545]  I do not agree with his proposal.
[01:00:34.545 --> 01:00:36.746]  I do not think it is the right solution.
[01:00:36.746 --> 01:00:41.169]  And the right solution, I believe, is the legislation that I've introduced.
[01:00:41.169 --> 01:00:43.730]  Legislation that would impose a three-year moratorium.
[01:00:45.442 --> 01:00:53.526]  On the refugees coming from countries where ISIS or Al-Qaeda control a substantial amount of territory.
[01:00:53.526 --> 01:00:58.348]  This is legislation that is targeted directly to the problem.
[01:00:58.348 --> 01:00:59.648]  And the reason is simple.
[01:00:59.648 --> 01:01:03.430]  We have been told by the FBI they cannot vet these refugees.
[01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:11.134]  The second piece of legislation Governor Abbott mentioned is legislation that I filed today that will protect the authority of the states.
[01:01:12.048 --> 01:01:16.772]  And the authority of governors to keep their citizens safe.
[01:01:16.772 --> 01:01:24.998]  And it would say that in the event the president wants to send refugees to a particular state that a governor has the ability to opt out.
[01:01:24.998 --> 01:01:33.544]  To conclude that the federal government has not done a sufficient job ensuring that the safety and security of the citizens of the state will be protected.
[01:01:33.544 --> 01:01:41.430]  And then the third piece of legislation that I have tried to bring up in recent weeks and the Democrats have blocked is the Expatriate Terrorist Act.
[01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:53.108]  Which provides that if an American goes and travels abroad and joins ISIS, and takes up arms and wages jihad against the United States, that he or she forfeits their U.S.
[01:01:53.108 --> 01:01:53.628]  citizenship.
[01:01:53.628 --> 01:01:54.749]  That's a good idea.
[01:01:54.749 --> 01:01:57.831]  All of these are reasonable, common-sense steps.
[01:01:57.831 --> 01:01:58.752]  Yep.
[01:01:58.752 --> 01:01:59.653]  To keep America safe.
[01:02:01.294 --> 01:02:03.479]  That's Senator Ted Cruz, very presidential.
[01:02:03.479 --> 01:02:09.571]  I mean, he probably is the smartest of all the candidates on the Republican side, other than Trump when it comes to business.
[01:02:09.571 --> 01:02:12.517]  And Trump knows people like stuff said kind of at a street level.
[01:02:13.735 --> 01:02:15.816]  Trump says, that's what he's got, street smarts.
[01:02:15.816 --> 01:02:23.260]  Cruz is very statesmanly, very cerebral, and what he's saying is an accurate, basic plan.
[01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:33.766]  I mean, it's the bare minimum you should do when 25% of the people in a poll say that they support suicide bombers, or they support ISIS.
[01:02:33.766 --> 01:02:39.549]  That's because they admit between 75 and 80 plus percent, depending on which numbers come out from Interpol,
[01:02:40.834 --> 01:02:43.735]  The EU, you name it, are not Syrians.
[01:02:43.735 --> 01:02:50.578]  They came to take over land.
[01:02:50.578 --> 01:02:55.980]  Just like the Saudi Arabians did one time before they came in and took over Syria and got kicked back out.
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:59.462]  There's a movie about it, it's called Lawrence of Arabia.
[01:02:59.462 --> 01:03:03.164]  And it's not their country.
[01:03:03.164 --> 01:03:04.064]  And they're there taking it.
[01:03:05.811 --> 01:03:07.511]  They never had any history up there.
[01:03:07.511 --> 01:03:09.032]  They have no reason to be there.
[01:03:09.032 --> 01:03:09.932]  They're there.
[01:03:09.932 --> 01:03:15.053]  And then now, they're going to come here, and they are incompatible to live anywhere.
[01:03:15.053 --> 01:03:18.534]  I mean, Saudi Arabia is a freak zone of craziness.
[01:03:18.534 --> 01:03:26.416]  From all the military and family I've talked to that have worked for different companies, but over there, I mean, they catch you with a Bible on the street, folks, you're going to be in prison for life.
[01:03:26.416 --> 01:03:27.796]  Lucky they don't chop your head off.
[01:03:28.678 --> 01:03:32.821]  And all they do is peck at each other to make the others more radical.
[01:03:32.821 --> 01:03:33.682]  That's what cults do.
[01:03:33.682 --> 01:03:39.287]  They just get more and more extreme, more and more whacked out, more and more weird.
[01:03:39.287 --> 01:03:41.889]  And I for one am completely sick of it.
[01:03:41.889 --> 01:03:43.230]  I do not have Islamophobia.
[01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:47.874]  I have Wahhabist Saudi Arabia phobia.
[01:03:47.874 --> 01:03:49.455]  I have cult phobia.
[01:03:50.981 --> 01:03:57.187]  And who's the other group acts like a cult that I can see that I am just as disgusted by because they are so freakish.
[01:03:57.187 --> 01:03:59.069]  They are so weird.
[01:03:59.069 --> 01:04:04.555]  And they're teamed up with the jihadis, with the Wahhabist jihadis.
[01:04:04.555 --> 01:04:07.738]  And that is the politically correct left.
[01:04:10.612 --> 01:04:36.846]  That you cannot make up how serious their war on words, their war on logic, their war on discussion, their war on free speech, their war on creativity, their war on beauty, their war on arithmetic, their war on literature, their war on culture, their war on common sense, their war on logic, their war on beauty, their war on men, their war on women, their war on basic human systems.
[01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:44.994]  Students at Pennsylvania College want Lynch Hall renamed because of the word Lynch.
[01:04:44.994 --> 01:04:47.997]  I'm going to cover this and take your phone calls when we come back.
[01:04:47.997 --> 01:04:56.645]  Folks, they know exactly what they're doing when they say ban the Irish word Lynch that has nothing to do with hanging black people.
[01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:02.334]  Hillary Clinton wants to censor people who make fun of her.
[01:05:02.334 --> 01:05:08.322]  She was recently trying to censor comedy skits that poked fun at her, which were produced by the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles, California.
[01:05:08.322 --> 01:05:14.891]  The owner of the Laugh Factory, Jamie Masada, told Judicial Watch that her campaign threatened to put him out of business if he didn't pull the videos.
[01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:23.978]  So in response to this attack on free speech, InfoWars.com has launched the Make Fun of Hillary Defend the First Amendment contest with a first place cash prize of $5,000.

[01:08:28.634 --> 01:08:35.978]  to 3 p.m., we are here live broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars News Center in Austin, Texas.
[01:08:35.978 --> 01:08:37.239]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:08:38.905 --> 01:08:42.306]  We also, of course, have InfoWars and Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central.
[01:08:42.306 --> 01:08:45.007]  Find details at InfoWarsNews.com.
[01:08:45.007 --> 01:08:46.288]  Okay.
[01:08:46.288 --> 01:08:51.110]  We've got loaded phone lines, Tony, Isaiah, Cliff, Kevin, Dan, and many others.
[01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:54.671]  The toll-free number to join me, if you're a first-time caller, we've got the phones open, 800-259-9231.
[01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:54.711]  800-259-9231.
[01:09:03.454 --> 01:09:17.448]  We have Roger Stone, advisor to nine presidents, and who's been involved in elections here and all over the world, and one of Trump's top advisors, joining us for an hour and a half to talk all things Planet Trump and election 2016.
[01:09:17.448 --> 01:09:23.795]  And Leanne McAdoo will be hosting the fourth hour today.
[01:09:25.373 --> 01:09:39.763]  Now, we've had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, we've had Senator Lindsey Graham, we've had countless other Republican candidates, Jeb Bush, people like Rick Ross, the fake Rick Ross, come out.
[01:09:39.763 --> 01:09:44.206]  And, well, Rick Ross had killed Donald Trump, so he wants him to be murdered.
[01:09:44.206 --> 01:09:54.794]  And Kareem Abdul-Jabbar claims that he's helping ISIS, he's the ISIS candidate, when he actually called for bombing their oil that they're trying to sell, and actually agreed with Putin and others, something the other candidates didn't do.
[01:09:56.431 --> 01:10:01.514]  So Donald Trump is right on about, like I said, about 95% of his views and topics.
[01:10:01.514 --> 01:10:06.077]  I disagree with him on a few things like the internet and, you know, restricting it so ISIS doesn't get it.
[01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:07.578]  You just can't do that.
[01:10:07.578 --> 01:10:25.269]  So there are some problems with Trump, but compared to a Hillary Clinton or compared to a Lindsey Graham or compared to a socialist senator from Connecticut, it is complete and total absolute night and day.
[01:10:26.735 --> 01:10:35.302]  And before we go to the calls, though, the problem we're dealing with, as the Pew Research shows, the middle class is disappearing at the fastest rate ever.
[01:10:35.302 --> 01:10:40.286]  The workforce is set to shrink two million people.
[01:10:40.286 --> 01:10:49.753]  The Congressional Budget Office is saying just from the first year of full implementation of Obamacare, we're only 21 days out from that nightmare, the fines, all the rest of it.
[01:10:49.753 --> 01:10:51.895]  Morgan Stanley begins layoffs in credit division.
[01:10:54.338 --> 01:10:59.060]  While all this is going on, the FBI admits they're not vetting any of these refugees.
[01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:01.241]  A large portion admit they want to be terrorists.
[01:11:01.241 --> 01:11:04.502]  They're attacking Europe on a basically weekly basis.
[01:11:04.502 --> 01:11:05.563]  We're getting attacked.
[01:11:05.563 --> 01:11:14.386]  They try to say all these attacks aren't attacks, whether it's Fort Hood or what happened last Wednesday, eight days ago.
[01:11:14.386 --> 01:11:19.929]  And in the midst of this though, they want Thomas Jefferson statues taken down all over the country.
[01:11:20.834 --> 01:11:24.936]  Because he tried to ban slavery in the Declaration of Independence, but it was removed.
[01:11:24.936 --> 01:11:25.976]  That's how ignorant they are.
[01:11:25.976 --> 01:11:33.459]  And they go, but he had slaves that he was trying to change the law to free.
[01:11:33.459 --> 01:11:34.640]  The time he was in.
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:37.981]  It's like saying, Schindler went along with the Nazis.
[01:11:37.981 --> 01:11:41.943]  Yeah, as he tried to save Jews, he had to or they'd kill him right there on the spot.
[01:11:41.943 --> 01:11:45.064]  I mean, there's just no understanding of the time people are in.
[01:11:47.449 --> 01:12:01.451]  But you see things like Seattle where the official city, not some idiot students, but the official city says don't bring brown bags to any city function and don't say that a city function brown bag it.
[01:12:02.435 --> 01:12:06.558]  Because Brown, saying the word Brown might hurt somebody's feeling or seeing Brown.
[01:12:06.558 --> 01:12:09.279]  Now, they admitted no one ever claimed it was racist.
[01:12:09.279 --> 01:12:09.419]  No, no.
[01:12:09.419 --> 01:12:24.549]  They have to attach racial meaning or religious bigotry or something, infighting, to all words in all language so when they want to, they can selectively demonize your speech and disqualify.
[01:12:24.549 --> 01:12:25.890]  It's a war on words.
[01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:30.873]  You know, George Orwell said, Eric Blair, writer for the BBC, propagandist for British intelligence,
[01:12:31.798 --> 01:12:33.700]  Winston Smith is an allegory of himself.
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:34.920]  He admitted that before he died.
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:38.964]  He died a year after he published, 1984.
[01:12:38.964 --> 01:12:49.452]  But in 1949, it's 1948 reverse, ladies and gentlemen, of what it would be if the Fabian socialist liberals took over, what the world would look like.
[01:12:49.452 --> 01:12:52.254]  And you notice it's looking more and more like that.
[01:12:52.254 --> 01:12:54.856]  Because he was in there amongst them.
[01:12:54.856 --> 01:12:56.157]  And he wrote essays admitting it.
[01:12:58.342 --> 01:12:59.723]  He didn't like radical right-wingers.
[01:12:59.723 --> 01:13:01.525]  He'd been a leftist his whole life.
[01:13:01.525 --> 01:13:07.511]  Fought in the Spanish Civil War.
[01:13:07.511 --> 01:13:09.533]  Been a member of the secret police before that in India.
[01:13:09.533 --> 01:13:12.476]  That's what made him a leftist, was the abuse of Indians in India.
[01:13:14.369 --> 01:13:15.610]  But I digress.
[01:13:15.610 --> 01:13:34.602]  He said the goal will be by the Fabian Socialists to reduce language down to such a level that you cannot communicate with someone and have them even understand how they've been lied to and they'll have double think where they hold two opposite thoughts in their mind at the same time and believe each one as valid as the other.
[01:13:34.602 --> 01:13:39.445]  That's what they're indoctrinating us with is like this mental illness.
[01:13:39.445 --> 01:13:40.966]  This mass Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:52.204]  And so sitting back, looking at all of this, they have to expand it out always more and more.
[01:13:52.204 --> 01:13:58.548]  So the real racism of targeting blacks with Planned Parenthood isn't looked at, or targeting Hispanics with Gardasil shots isn't looked at.
[01:13:58.548 --> 01:14:03.631]  No, no, you've just got to then say, well, if you don't have totally open borders and pay for everything free, you're a racist.
[01:14:05.683 --> 01:14:11.046]  Or, if Donald Trump goes to a Jewish group and says, you know, Jews are really known for being smart, hard-working folks.
[01:14:11.046 --> 01:14:12.687]  It's good to be here with such good people.
[01:14:12.687 --> 01:14:18.270]  Oh, it's racist to attribute something to a racial or religious group.
[01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:19.911]  No, everybody said, look at the Japanese.
[01:14:19.911 --> 01:14:22.192]  Crime went down during the tsunami.
[01:14:22.192 --> 01:14:24.113]  And during the earthquakes.
[01:14:24.113 --> 01:14:25.174]  When things got tough.
[01:14:25.174 --> 01:14:26.154]  Almost no crime.
[01:14:26.154 --> 01:14:27.315]  Wow, what amazing people.
[01:14:27.315 --> 01:14:30.997]  That's not anti-Japanese.
[01:14:30.997 --> 01:14:33.118]  See, they're attacking your ability
[01:14:34.295 --> 01:14:35.656]  To discriminate.
[01:14:35.656 --> 01:14:39.458]  See, some discrimination is obviously wrong if it's based not on real issues.
[01:14:39.458 --> 01:14:43.521]  But if it's based on, I've been to that restaurant twice and got food poisoning both times.
[01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:49.805]  It's not racist or discriminatory or whatever to discriminate and say, I like the hamburgers at that place.
[01:14:49.805 --> 01:14:50.986]  I like this ketchup.
[01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:52.447]  I like this brand of car.
[01:14:52.447 --> 01:14:55.229]  I like women that look like this and act like this.
[01:14:55.229 --> 01:14:56.510]  It's what you like.
[01:14:56.510 --> 01:15:01.613]  They're saying you can't have your own opinions or be a free, conscious individual.
[01:15:01.613 --> 01:15:03.555]  That is cult-like, isn't it?
[01:15:03.555 --> 01:15:03.995]  By design.
[01:15:05.455 --> 01:15:08.957]  So now, students at Pennsylvania School want Lynch Hall.
[01:15:08.957 --> 01:15:10.918]  This is Associated Press.
[01:15:10.918 --> 01:15:13.719]  This isn't Infowars.com.
[01:15:13.719 --> 01:15:21.262]  Students at Pennsylvania School want Lynch Hall renamed because the word Lynch.
[01:15:21.262 --> 01:15:23.603]  Now, I went and looked it up.
[01:15:23.603 --> 01:15:27.945]  Lynch means mariner or water in the Irish Gaelic.
[01:15:29.264 --> 01:15:31.746]  And it basically means the same thing in the Nordic Lynch.
[01:15:31.746 --> 01:15:35.728]  There's also a Nordic Lynch, because all the groups are really related to each other.
[01:15:35.728 --> 01:15:39.650]  Which shows how stupid it is the British Empire could play different groups off against each other.
[01:15:39.650 --> 01:15:42.732]  It's totally moronic, but another side issue.
[01:15:42.732 --> 01:15:45.654]  Divide and Conquer, they call it the great game.
[01:15:45.654 --> 01:15:48.436]  This is from Ancestry.com.
[01:15:48.436 --> 01:15:53.659]  Irish Lynch, Anglicized from Gaelic.
[01:15:53.659 --> 01:15:58.722]  Longishine, a personal name meaning Mariner from Longship, or Viking basically.
[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:01.841]  Okay.
[01:16:01.841 --> 01:16:04.102]  Men in longboats.
[01:16:04.102 --> 01:16:05.463]  Let's continue.
[01:16:05.463 --> 01:16:09.245]  That shuttled Ireland.
[01:16:09.245 --> 01:16:10.346]  The etymology.
[01:16:10.346 --> 01:16:12.527]  This is from the encyclopedia.
[01:16:14.656 --> 01:16:18.779]  The origins of the word lynch are obscure, but likely originate from the American Revolution.
[01:16:18.779 --> 01:16:26.384]  The term originates from the phrase lynch law, passed to stop people lynching, punishment without trial.
[01:16:26.384 --> 01:16:29.186]  So see, the word lynch is good, meaning stop doing it.
[01:16:29.186 --> 01:16:33.008]  Two Americans during this era are generally credited with the phrase.
[01:16:33.008 --> 01:16:36.270]  Charles Lynch and William Lynch, both lived in Virginia in the 1870s and 1880s.
[01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:39.252]  I'm trying to go too fast here because I want to go to calls.
[01:16:39.252 --> 01:16:40.913]  I'm going to slow down and cover this.
[01:16:40.913 --> 01:16:41.694]  Charles Lynch
[01:16:44.977 --> 01:16:49.901]  And then it just goes over the fact that it was a case of lynching.
[01:16:49.901 --> 01:16:51.603]  And by the way, none of a black person.
[01:16:51.603 --> 01:16:53.765]  But this is how emotional it is.
[01:16:53.765 --> 01:17:00.190]  You hear a Nordic or an Irish Gaelic name that means mariner or boatman.
[01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:10.499]  And then you want it banned because all you know is the word lynch is associated with hanging black people when really it was two white men hanging a member of their family who were named Lynch.
[01:17:13.052 --> 01:17:23.957]  But see, for them it's a power thing to take language away, to take people's rights away, to have a name, to demand history be overwritten.
[01:17:23.957 --> 01:17:25.377]  This is the essence of 1984, changing history.
[01:17:29.266 --> 01:17:32.269]  I mean, so what if it was a racist weirdo that founded your college?
[01:17:32.269 --> 01:17:33.270]  You run it now.
[01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:34.292]  It's run by your people.
[01:17:34.292 --> 01:17:35.193]  It's a building.
[01:17:35.193 --> 01:17:36.174]  It's a colony.
[01:17:36.174 --> 01:17:36.995]  It's a system.
[01:17:36.995 --> 01:17:38.276]  It's where you're supposed to learn.
[01:17:38.276 --> 01:17:42.340]  You learn how to infight, not how to get a job, not how to be normal.
[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:47.866]  It'd be like saying if a moray eel had lived in a hole in coral 20 years before,
[01:17:48.547 --> 01:17:50.310]  And now a grouper lives in it.
[01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:53.635]  Does the grouper say moray eels eat baby groupers?
[01:17:53.635 --> 01:17:55.077]  So this was a racist hole?
[01:17:55.077 --> 01:18:01.808]  So I'm not going to live in this amore eels hole because he doesn't even care that an amore eel lived there 20 years before.
[01:18:01.808 --> 01:18:02.789]  He doesn't even know it.
[01:18:02.789 --> 01:18:03.511]  It's a good hole.
[01:18:06.025 --> 01:18:06.885]  Oh, change it!
[01:18:06.885 --> 01:18:08.246]  But it wasn't a racist.
[01:18:08.246 --> 01:18:09.946]  It wasn't named after a lynch mom.
[01:18:09.946 --> 01:18:11.786]  It was named after somebody named Lynch.
[01:18:11.786 --> 01:18:15.447]  And they say, well, the word Lynch could draw up frightening connotations.
[01:18:15.447 --> 01:18:18.708]  We're scared by the word, so get rid of it.
[01:18:18.708 --> 01:18:20.488]  I mean, you talk about idiots.
[01:18:20.488 --> 01:18:23.989]  Instead of the fun, if somebody said this, of going and looking it up.
[01:18:23.989 --> 01:18:25.069]  Oh, it means boatman.
[01:18:25.069 --> 01:18:26.089]  It means sailor.
[01:18:26.089 --> 01:18:30.910]  It means somebody in a navy.
[01:18:30.910 --> 01:18:34.811]  Students at a small Pennsylvania college are demanding, they're doing a walkout.
[01:18:35.857 --> 01:18:43.221]  And laying on the sidewalk, the administrators rename a building called Lynch Memorial Hall because of the racial overturns of the word Lynch.
[01:18:43.221 --> 01:18:45.682]  Oh, there's overtones in Brown Bag, too.
[01:18:45.682 --> 01:18:50.745]  The building is named after Clyde A. Lynch, who was president of Lebanon Valley College until 1950.
[01:18:50.745 --> 01:18:58.949]  And they said they want it renamed after his first name and middle initial because the word
[01:19:01.041 --> 01:19:05.088]  Recalls the public executions of black men by white mobs in the 18 and 1900s.
[01:19:07.725 --> 01:19:11.228]  It was included on a list of demands that students presented to the school on Friday.
[01:19:11.228 --> 01:19:30.743]  I mean, you talk about a group of ignorant morons, and by the way, have any of their professors dared educate them and say, hey, it's an Irish name, it's a Nordic name, it has nothing to do with any of this, it means sailor, this guy is just Irish, you know, he helped get this building built, he gave the money for it so you can be in it.
[01:19:30.743 --> 01:19:32.265]  They just go, no!
[01:19:32.265 --> 01:19:34.186]  Which word scares us?
[01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:35.127]  We want it banned!
[01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:40.681]  Think about that.
[01:19:40.681 --> 01:19:42.762]  These people aren't going to be able to get jobs or have a life.
[01:19:42.762 --> 01:19:46.904]  They are going to be gibbering mentally ill people when they come out of college.
[01:19:46.904 --> 01:19:48.065]  The ones that buy into this.
[01:19:48.065 --> 01:19:58.551]  That just know how to see shadows and phantoms everywhere while their basic freedoms are being removed collectively regardless of race, color, creed, religion against them all.
[01:20:00.191 --> 01:20:03.313]  Still wondering what to get that special someone that has everything?
[01:20:03.313 --> 01:20:13.458]  At ID Stronghold, we still find that a huge percentage of people do not yet have an RFID blocking wallet or purse to protect them from the new and growing threat of electronic pickpocketing.
[01:20:13.458 --> 01:20:14.058]  That's right.
[01:20:14.058 --> 01:20:26.785]  Even though 40% of all new chipped payment cards shipped in 2014 contain a wireless interface called RFID that allows the account information to be skimmed by a thief passing near your cards, most people are still unprotected.
[01:20:27.185 --> 01:20:32.931]  The good news is that ID Stronghold makes luxurious leather wallets and other products that prevent this.
[01:20:32.931 --> 01:20:41.879]  ID Stronghold founded the entire RFID protection industry and has been protecting the RFID chips in government and military ID cards for over a decade.
[01:20:41.879 --> 01:20:47.845]  So go to idstronghold.com and get that loved one a stylish leather RFID blocking wallet or clutch.
[01:20:47.845 --> 01:20:49.547]  That's idstronghold.com.
[01:20:49.867 --> 01:20:52.689]  After all, wallets and purses have always been a great gift.

[01:22:24.858 --> 01:22:27.179]  My name is Jonathan Wright, and I'm 40 years old.
[01:22:27.179 --> 01:22:30.020]  I recently went from a desk job to a manual labor job.
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:31.140]  Normally, I'm worn out.
[01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:36.942]  With Energy Enhanced One World Way, I now recover so quickly that I can perform very hard work all day long.

[01:24:11.589 --> 01:24:16.433]  Is it getting better?
[01:24:16.433 --> 01:24:21.796]  Or do you feel the same?
[01:24:21.796 --> 01:24:24.178]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[01:24:24.178 --> 01:24:26.560]  But you got Donald Trump to blame.
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.501]  You got someone to blame.
[01:24:28.501 --> 01:24:31.703]  That's right, they say he is behind ISIS.
[01:24:31.703 --> 01:24:32.804]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[01:24:32.804 --> 01:24:36.206]  That's the new talking point by the Republicans, the Democrats, all of them.
[01:24:36.206 --> 01:24:36.887]  Hillary Clinton.
[01:24:39.227 --> 01:24:51.196]  That creature, Lindsey Graham, John McCain, they're all out there saying that Donald Trump is helping ISIS and then giving no intellectual facts.
[01:24:51.196 --> 01:24:53.238]  No, Donald Trump's trying to keep ISIS out of this country.
[01:24:53.238 --> 01:25:06.488]  And when there's more terror attacks, and Donald Trump points out it's another person got into this country on a phony visa, with phony info, will he get rewarded with people's support?
[01:25:06.488 --> 01:25:07.069]  Probably not.
[01:25:08.544 --> 01:25:10.605]  Because the ones that already support him know what's going on.
[01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:16.088]  The ones that don't, they don't care how much evidence there is, how much common sense there is.
[01:25:16.088 --> 01:25:29.194]  They're the kind of people that want to change the name of Lynch Hall at a college because the last guy's name is Lynch, and they associate that with someone being hung or killed extrajudicially.
[01:25:29.194 --> 01:25:33.616]  Meanwhile, Obama wants to lynch all gun owners extrajudicially.
[01:25:33.616 --> 01:25:34.377]  I just thought of that.
[01:25:35.447 --> 01:25:47.524]  I use fancy terms like extrajudicial, banning your flight, banning your guns, banning your travel, the blood of tyranny, the oxygen of tyranny, the atmosphere on which its wings flap.
[01:25:49.366 --> 01:25:53.289]  And, oh, we're going to just put you on a no-fly list for no reason, and then you can't have a gun!
[01:25:53.289 --> 01:25:54.770]  A no-gun list!
[01:25:54.770 --> 01:25:57.351]  A lynch mob on the Second Amendment.
[01:25:57.351 --> 01:25:58.172]  That's what it is.
[01:25:58.172 --> 01:26:03.055]  An extrajudicial magic lynch mob in the unelected government.
[01:26:03.055 --> 01:26:08.678]  Like the NDAA says they'll grab you, they'll interrogate you, they'll torture you, they'll kill you, even U.S.
[01:26:08.678 --> 01:26:13.902]  citizens, and you don't have a right to even tell your family they have you before they kill you.
[01:26:13.902 --> 01:26:15.823]  And they can use torture against you.
[01:26:15.823 --> 01:26:16.644]  A classic
[01:26:17.384 --> 01:26:22.928]  Torture lynch mob, but because there's a real lynching going on, no one seems to care!
[01:26:22.928 --> 01:26:29.553]  Because the word is so scary from the name it comes from in the name of the law.
[01:26:29.553 --> 01:26:35.498]  Ignorance on top of ignorance on top of moronic idiocy.
[01:26:35.498 --> 01:26:39.901]  But you talk to these university students, I guarantee you they'll get all mad and go, Trigger!
[01:26:39.901 --> 01:26:40.221]  Trigger!
[01:26:40.221 --> 01:26:41.042]  Get back!
[01:26:41.042 --> 01:26:41.763]  You're being aggressive!
[01:26:41.763 --> 01:26:42.563]  You're being hateful!
[01:26:42.563 --> 01:26:42.944]  Get back!
[01:26:42.944 --> 01:26:43.264]  Get back!
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:46.982]  I ran into some weirdo lady at Target.
[01:26:46.982 --> 01:26:50.825]  I hardly ever go to big box stores, but I was going there.
[01:26:50.825 --> 01:26:54.868]  My son likes some of the sweaters they've got there, and they're cheap, whatever he likes.
[01:26:54.868 --> 01:26:55.569]  He loves the sweater.
[01:26:55.569 --> 01:26:56.549]  He wears it all the time.
[01:26:56.549 --> 01:26:57.330]  It's like 15 bucks.
[01:26:57.330 --> 01:26:58.651]  I went and bought like four more of them.
[01:26:58.651 --> 01:27:00.693]  It's like his uniform now.
[01:27:00.693 --> 01:27:01.754]  He wanted to go to Target.
[01:27:01.754 --> 01:27:02.354]  I'm in Target.
[01:27:02.354 --> 01:27:03.435]  I know we have a lot of phones here.
[01:27:03.435 --> 01:27:06.878]  I'm going to go to you.
[01:27:06.878 --> 01:27:08.639]  One of my daughters wanted something, so she walked over.
[01:27:08.639 --> 01:27:09.159]  I walked with her.
[01:27:09.159 --> 01:27:09.600]  I came back.
[01:27:10.546 --> 01:27:13.749]  And a lady had pulled up and, you know, he was already there putting stuff off the cart.
[01:27:13.749 --> 01:27:16.691]  And I just squeezed through, barely even touched her cart.
[01:27:16.691 --> 01:27:19.353]  And she went, oh!
[01:27:19.353 --> 01:27:20.514]  You need to make right on this!
[01:27:20.514 --> 01:27:21.735]  You just rammed into me!
[01:27:21.735 --> 01:27:23.256]  And I said, well, excuse me, I'm sorry.
[01:27:23.256 --> 01:27:25.718]  I believe I just barely touched your cart, but I'm sorry.
[01:27:25.718 --> 01:27:26.999]  She goes, get back!
[01:27:26.999 --> 01:27:30.782]  You're a very dangerous, scary man!
[01:27:30.782 --> 01:27:32.464]  And the lady behind the counter goes, excuse me?
[01:27:32.464 --> 01:27:33.445]  She's like, what?
[01:27:33.445 --> 01:27:34.105]  What's going on, lady?
[01:27:34.105 --> 01:27:36.227]  And she's like, I feel threatened!
[01:27:36.227 --> 01:27:37.408]  She had these two sons with her.
[01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:41.172]  And I went, oh, and I kind of turned my back, and I said, it's OK, guys.
[01:27:41.172 --> 01:27:46.759]  And she starts going, yeah, I bet Mr. Celebrity on his AM radio will be talking about this.
[01:27:46.759 --> 01:27:47.920]  And I went, oh.
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:52.726]  And I just kept my mouth shut, got the sweaters, the socks, the underwear he wanted, got out of there.
[01:27:54.246 --> 01:27:56.209]  My daughters wanted some robes.
[01:27:56.209 --> 01:27:57.590]  We got them robes.
[01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:58.211]  Impulse Buy.
[01:27:58.211 --> 01:28:00.374]  They all, you know, girls, myself included.
[01:28:00.374 --> 01:28:01.475]  God, I always wanted something.
[01:28:01.475 --> 01:28:02.297]  Mama was going to the store.
[01:28:02.297 --> 01:28:03.478]  You know, what am I getting?
[01:28:03.478 --> 01:28:08.645]  But I got in, I got out, and I just, I learned to, I was like, ooh, keep my mouth shut.
[01:28:08.645 --> 01:28:11.348]  And she was smiling and laughing for like two minutes.
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:15.581]  See, this is their weapon.
[01:28:15.581 --> 01:28:18.905]  It's, ah, you touch my card, I feel threatened.
[01:28:18.905 --> 01:28:22.709]  Just, you know, they got that whip of I'm in control now.
[01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:25.773]  Everything's a big university that I'm in control of.
[01:28:25.773 --> 01:28:30.938]  Well, Alex Jones is in line with me.
[01:28:30.938 --> 01:28:33.221]  I'm gonna exercise power.
[01:28:33.221 --> 01:28:34.763]  I'm gonna conquer something.
[01:28:35.976 --> 01:28:38.478]  And you know she had a federal or state job.
[01:28:38.478 --> 01:28:44.921]  You know, I bet money she's got some job where she can press her thumb down on little people all day selectively when she wants.
[01:28:44.921 --> 01:28:48.864]  And she had that smile, that look in her eyes.
[01:28:48.864 --> 01:28:50.765]  And I looked at her sad little sons, man.
[01:28:50.765 --> 01:28:54.447]  I'm not going to say what they looked like, but boy.
[01:28:54.447 --> 01:28:56.048]  I couldn't take it after about a minute and a half.
[01:28:56.048 --> 01:28:59.010]  And I just looked at them and I said, man, I bet it's rough at home.
[01:28:59.010 --> 01:29:04.894]  And her sons, they're about ages 10 and 13, looked at me and smiled knowingly.
[01:29:04.894 --> 01:29:05.574]  I shouldn't have done it.
[01:29:08.015 --> 01:29:08.475]  You know what?
[01:29:08.475 --> 01:29:09.436]  So she shut up.
[01:29:09.436 --> 01:29:13.177]  When I said that, then I just pushed the card off.
[01:29:13.177 --> 01:29:16.999]  So I guess I did get the little last comment, and I wasn't going to tell that story.
[01:29:16.999 --> 01:29:17.659]  It was so sad.
[01:29:17.659 --> 01:29:18.799]  We have a big guest coming up.
[01:29:18.799 --> 01:29:22.061]  You're all on Trump, so that means you're going to talk to him in this hour.
[01:29:22.061 --> 01:29:25.042]  I was going to go to you, but I went on a rant, which is what people tune in for.
[01:29:25.042 --> 01:29:25.682]  I apologize.
[01:29:25.682 --> 01:29:26.682]  It's teleprompter free.
[01:29:26.682 --> 01:29:27.823]  It's real.
[01:29:27.823 --> 01:29:31.024]  So Tony, listening on WBCR 1470 in Tennessee, Isaiah,
[01:29:33.795 --> 01:29:40.038]  Cliff, Kevin, Dan, and others, your calls are coming up with the one, the only Roger Stone.
[01:29:40.038 --> 01:29:49.123]  I knew who he was, but man, I tell you, once I did more research on him, advisor to nine presidents and one of Donald Trump's chief advisors, straight ahead.
[01:29:49.123 --> 01:29:53.025]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.025 --> 01:29:55.727]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.029 --> 01:30:04.616]  I'm a proud Muslim, but you don't have to share my faith to share my disgust.
[01:30:04.616 --> 01:30:14.891]  That was written by Hillary Clinton's right-hand woman, Huma Abedin, who pinned the email in response to Donald Trump's recent proposition to impose a complete and total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.
[01:30:15.171 --> 01:30:22.994]  You know, it was the FBI director, the head of counter-terrorism, and Homeland Security who all said under oath that they cannot properly vet people coming in from Syria.
[01:30:22.994 --> 01:30:24.414]  But let's take a look at Ms.
[01:30:24.414 --> 01:30:25.395]  Abedin.
[01:30:25.395 --> 01:30:33.778]  Back in 2012, five Republicans sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security noting that three of her family members had very close ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:30:33.778 --> 01:30:36.999]  She was also intimately involved in Hillary Clinton's email scandal.
[01:30:37.259 --> 01:30:39.081]  And while she was at the State Department, Ms.
[01:30:39.081 --> 01:30:44.145]  Abedin helped our country cozy up to Sheikh Yusuf al-Khawardi, a promoter of jihadist terror.
[01:30:44.145 --> 01:30:48.950]  And one of her many accomplishments while at the State Department was helping destroy the country of Libya.
[01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:52.573]  I'm sure her and her Muslim Brotherhood friends are very proud of that achievement.
[01:30:52.573 --> 01:30:56.797]  Just imagine what she can do when her best pal Hillary Clinton gets into the White House.
[01:30:56.797 --> 01:30:58.539]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com
[01:30:59.833 --> 01:31:01.474]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:31:01.474 --> 01:31:02.954]  You can't survive without it.
[01:31:02.954 --> 01:31:03.875]  But where do you get it?
[01:31:03.875 --> 01:31:10.157]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:31:10.157 --> 01:31:15.859]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:31:16.059 --> 01:31:32.926]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:31:33.246 --> 01:31:34.206]  I want more candy!
[01:31:34.206 --> 01:31:35.647]  I want more video games!
[01:31:35.647 --> 01:31:36.027]  Mine!
[01:31:36.027 --> 01:31:36.227]  Mine!
[01:31:36.227 --> 01:31:36.327]  Mine!
[01:32:02.899 --> 01:32:12.644]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:32:12.644 --> 01:32:15.345]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:32:15.345 --> 01:32:18.887]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:32:18.887 --> 01:32:25.210]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[01:32:25.210 --> 01:32:30.053]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:32:30.333 --> 01:32:36.738]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:32:36.738 --> 01:32:44.465]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:32:44.465 --> 01:32:52.011]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[01:32:52.011 --> 01:32:55.634]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:55.634 --> 01:32:58.556]  That's ChildEase exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:33:10.171 --> 01:33:18.593]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.593 --> 01:33:37.058]  So a university in Pennsylvania, the Associated Press is reporting, with a straight face, the students have walked out, they are doing these die-ins where they lay on the ground, until the library hall at Lebanon Valley College
[01:33:39.289 --> 01:33:43.972]  Removes the name Lynch Memorial Hall.
[01:33:43.972 --> 01:33:46.774]  Not because the guy was involved in lynching anybody.
[01:33:46.774 --> 01:33:49.315]  Not because Lynch is an Irish name.
[01:33:49.315 --> 01:33:52.077]  Not because it means boatman or mariner or seaman.
[01:33:53.431 --> 01:33:56.492]  No, because they're scared of the word Lynch.
[01:33:56.492 --> 01:34:02.834]  And then David Knight just walked in during the break and he goes, Alex, who else is named Lynch in the administration?
[01:34:02.834 --> 01:34:04.595]  And I went, the Attorney General.
[01:34:04.595 --> 01:34:06.015]  I hadn't even thought of that.
[01:34:06.015 --> 01:34:08.056]  How rich is that?
[01:34:08.056 --> 01:34:19.140]  That Obama wants to extra-judicially lynch the Second Amendment and put you on a no-gun-by list on this phantom terror database when they actually won't screen the people coming in who are terrorists.
[01:34:20.802 --> 01:34:24.583]  And then the Attorney General is named Loretta Lynch.
[01:34:24.583 --> 01:34:26.584]  Then we should call for her to change her name.
[01:34:26.584 --> 01:34:28.225]  I feel threatened.
[01:34:28.225 --> 01:34:30.366]  I feel upset by it.
[01:34:30.366 --> 01:34:32.827]  Maybe AP should write a real article about that.
[01:34:32.827 --> 01:34:33.927]  Alex Jones.
[01:34:33.927 --> 01:34:36.948]  Maybe we should start a White House petition.
[01:34:36.948 --> 01:34:39.949]  Get thousands to sign it that the Attorney General change her name.
[01:34:39.949 --> 01:34:44.151]  Or just be Loretta L. Because it scares me.
[01:34:44.151 --> 01:34:48.613]  They want the study hall to be renamed his first name and his second initial.
[01:34:49.721 --> 01:34:52.203]  Because it's so frightening.
[01:34:52.203 --> 01:34:53.564]  They just put it on screen, folks.
[01:34:53.564 --> 01:34:55.305]  Loretta Lynch.
[01:34:55.305 --> 01:34:56.706]  Oh my gosh, Lynch!
[01:34:56.706 --> 01:34:57.767]  Get it off of there!
[01:34:57.767 --> 01:34:58.567]  Who put that on there?
[01:34:58.567 --> 01:35:00.448]  I'm writing you up or firing you.
[01:35:00.448 --> 01:35:03.771]  Who in the TV control room put up the word Lynch?
[01:35:03.771 --> 01:35:04.912]  It's a trigger for me.
[01:35:04.912 --> 01:35:07.013]  It's not a trigger.
[01:35:07.013 --> 01:35:14.438]  The middle class is imploding and even the Congressional Budget Office admits Obamacare is going to put two million people out of work next year.
[01:35:14.438 --> 01:35:16.179]  And there's huge fines.
[01:35:16.179 --> 01:35:18.281]  It was written by foreign insurance companies to screw us over.
[01:35:20.367 --> 01:35:21.468]  Her name is Lynch, folks.
[01:35:21.468 --> 01:35:23.429]  I'm having heart palpitations right now.
[01:35:23.429 --> 01:35:24.050]  I'm so scared.
[01:35:24.050 --> 01:35:26.292]  Please save me, Obama.
[01:35:26.292 --> 01:35:26.912]  But wait a minute.
[01:35:26.912 --> 01:35:28.513]  His name is Hussein.
[01:35:28.513 --> 01:35:29.955]  Saddam was scary.
[01:35:29.955 --> 01:35:30.755]  Saddam Hussein.
[01:35:30.755 --> 01:35:31.736]  Oh, wait a minute.
[01:35:31.736 --> 01:35:33.697]  I want Obama to change his name, too.
[01:35:33.697 --> 01:35:35.319]  See how I can play this game?
[01:35:35.319 --> 01:35:37.701]  I want all words banned except when I use them.
[01:35:37.701 --> 01:35:40.022]  Only I am allowed to talk.
[01:35:40.022 --> 01:35:40.883]  Talk about a cult.
[01:35:40.883 --> 01:35:41.844]  Talk about prisoners.
[01:35:41.844 --> 01:35:43.065]  Talk about brainwashing.
[01:35:43.065 --> 01:35:46.107]  Talk about political correctness.
[01:35:46.107 --> 01:35:49.410]  Joining us for the next hour and a half, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:35:50.635 --> 01:35:53.120]  It's rogerstoneofthestonezone.com.
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:58.469]  He's written a bunch of best-selling books for Skyhorse Publishing and others on a host of issues.
[01:35:59.665 --> 01:36:10.655]  And he has recently been all over television, from everything from Bill Maher to the Discovery Channel, discussing Planet Trump, that he's an expert in, because he's known Trump since the 1980s.
[01:36:10.655 --> 01:36:17.261]  And let me give you Roger Stone's bio, just so you know who he is, in case you don't.
[01:36:17.261 --> 01:36:25.388]  Roger Stone's a veteran of non-Republican presidential campaigns, serving Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Senator Bob Dole, to his subsequent regret, both George Bush 41 and 43.
[01:36:26.989 --> 01:36:40.372]  Stone's a New York Times best-selling author of The Man Who Killed Kennedy, or The Man Who Killed Kennedy, the case against LBJ, exposing the plot led by LBJ that included the CIA, the mob in big Texas oil that murdered John Kennedy.
[01:36:41.494 --> 01:36:44.879]  Now in paperback, the book has sold over 100,000 copies.
[01:36:44.879 --> 01:36:46.360]  I think it's a lot more than that.
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:59.877]  In August, Roger Stone resigned from Donald Trump's campaign to release his groundbreaking book, The Clinton's War on Women, which is the definitive expose of the corruption, immorality, criminal record of Bill Clinton and Hillary and Chelsea Clinton.
[01:37:00.558 --> 01:37:07.719]  Last week, Infowars had Donald Trump on the broadcast, and Donald Trump called him a patriot and a tough cookie.
[01:37:07.719 --> 01:37:09.780]  And here is what others have had to say.
[01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:18.481]  Roger Stone's next book, Jeb and the Bush Crime Family, rips the veil off the whitewash that has protected the Bush crime syndicate.
[01:37:18.481 --> 01:37:24.142]  It's a story of privilege, elitism, oil, money, assassination, sex, ambition, corruption, and power.
[01:37:24.142 --> 01:37:26.183]  And I'll tell you, if you can find his book,
[01:37:26.943 --> 01:37:30.285]  On a few online sites, and you can find it at bookstores, you better.
[01:37:30.285 --> 01:37:31.766]  Because they're reprinting it now.
[01:37:31.766 --> 01:37:33.227]  It's sold out.
[01:37:33.227 --> 01:37:35.748]  I've tried to buy 5,000 from Skyhorse.
[01:37:35.748 --> 01:37:37.489]  We have sold his books before.
[01:37:37.489 --> 01:37:38.670]  It's like, wait, I know this guy.
[01:37:38.670 --> 01:37:39.931]  I've read his books.
[01:37:39.931 --> 01:37:40.451]  Wait.
[01:37:40.451 --> 01:37:42.072]  It's like, wow, once he was in the studio with us.
[01:37:42.072 --> 01:37:46.135]  Because I knew who he was, but not how prominent he was and how much he'd been involved in.
[01:37:46.966 --> 01:37:57.640]  He'll definitely be a staple of the show from now on, because on elections, on third world, on presidents, you know, on Reagan, I mean, he knows so much about these guys he worked for.
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:01.365]  But what's exciting is he's known Trump for 30-something years.
[01:38:01.986 --> 01:38:07.970]  And, again, was his exploratory head when he was thinking about running four or five years ago.
[01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:16.015]  And so he can really tell you about Donald Trump and what really makes Donald Trump tick and all these big scandals that are happening and the rest of it.
[01:38:16.015 --> 01:38:28.283]  But, yes, if you can get The Clinton's War on Women, it is a hot book, sold out many places, and we're trying to get an emergency printing done right now so we get more before Christmas.
[01:38:28.283 --> 01:38:30.525]  But that is the bottom line.
[01:38:33.007 --> 01:38:42.411]  Now, continuing, ladies and gentlemen, with this info, I could sit here all day and bring up questions and comments for Mr. Stone.
[01:38:42.411 --> 01:38:54.117]  Whether he wants to get into the book first, whether he wants to get into the interview last week with Trump that he helped set up, and the inside baseball there, or whether he wants to dive into the current attacks on Trump.
[01:38:54.117 --> 01:38:57.218]  Let's let him decide what we get into first.
[01:38:57.218 --> 01:38:58.619]  Mr. Stone, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:38:59.179 --> 01:39:01.422]  Alex, thanks once again for having me.
[01:39:01.422 --> 01:39:01.743]  You bet.
[01:39:01.743 --> 01:39:03.205]  Where do you want to go first?
[01:39:03.205 --> 01:39:07.791]  Let's talk about the media savagery of Donald J. Trump.
[01:39:07.791 --> 01:39:13.979]  I must tell you, not since I saw Richard Nixon, my mentor, the man who gave me my start in politics,
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:24.169]  Under siege in 1974, while the mass media went out of their way to try to destroy him and drive him from public life, have I seen an onslaught like this?
[01:39:24.169 --> 01:39:33.978]  Donald Trump proposed a temporary ban on immigrants from Muslim countries until such time as U.S.
[01:39:33.978 --> 01:39:37.661]  representatives could get a handle on who wanted to come here.
[01:39:38.482 --> 01:39:42.243]  And the national media, as you know, has completely bastardized that.
[01:39:42.243 --> 01:39:50.346]  They have truncated his comments to make it appear that he called for a permanent ban of all Muslims for all time.
[01:39:50.346 --> 01:39:55.548]  And then they launched themselves into this long discussion of whether that would be unconstitutional.
[01:39:55.548 --> 01:39:58.809]  When in fact, that's not what Trump proposed at all.
[01:39:58.809 --> 01:40:01.510]  He put forward a common sense proposal
[01:40:02.210 --> 01:40:16.276]  Which the President of the United States clearly has the authority to do to freeze Muslim immigration temporarily until we can set up some kind of screening process to vet those who would like to come here.
[01:40:19.031 --> 01:40:20.252]  And that is what he said.
[01:40:20.252 --> 01:40:24.374]  They took it out of context to just say ban all Muslims and now they have all these people saying kill him.
[01:40:24.374 --> 01:40:26.295]  Rick Ross says he wants to murder him.
[01:40:26.295 --> 01:40:28.476]  The fake Rick Ross rapper.
[01:40:28.476 --> 01:40:42.184]  It's the cause celeb thing to do to pile on Lindsey Graham, Hillary Clinton saying he is helping ISIS when he's doing exactly what Russia is doing to take out ISIS before Russia even bombed their oil they're selling that they've stolen.
[01:40:42.184 --> 01:40:42.985]  He said do that.
[01:40:42.985 --> 01:40:44.626]  I mean he's been proven right on so many fronts.
[01:40:45.646 --> 01:40:52.592]  Yeah, you know, what this is, of course, is part and parcel of the fact that he scares the political class to death.
[01:40:52.592 --> 01:41:08.925]  The lobbyists, the consultant class, the special interests, the billionaires, Paul Singer, the Koch brothers, Steve Schwarzman, and others, because you would not have business as usual in Washington
[01:41:09.625 --> 01:41:11.427]  If Trump became president, good God!
[01:41:11.427 --> 01:41:17.555]  A president who actually worked for the American people and who couldn't be bought and sold.
[01:41:17.555 --> 01:41:27.428]  The other thing I found really laughable yesterday, Alex, was a charge by Jeb Bush, of all people, that Trump was in league with Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[01:41:28.308 --> 01:41:34.570]  That is, I can tell you, having known Trump for almost 40 years, that is laughable.
[01:41:34.570 --> 01:41:38.090]  He is one of the most competitive people in the country.
[01:41:38.090 --> 01:41:42.811]  He is running for president because he wants to save this country.
[01:41:42.811 --> 01:41:48.153]  Donald Trump would never be a straw man for someone else, anyone else.
[01:41:48.153 --> 01:41:54.214]  And frankly, he's the only guy in the country, the only guy in this race who has legal standing
[01:41:55.336 --> 01:41:59.419]  To bring a lawsuit against the Clinton Foundation because they defrauded him.
[01:41:59.419 --> 01:42:03.022]  He made a modest contribution thinking it was giving to charity.
[01:42:03.022 --> 01:42:07.785]  He now learns that he's given to a slush fund for grifters.
[01:42:07.785 --> 01:42:14.090]  Trump now has the power through a lawsuit to unravel the entire mess at the Clinton Foundation.
[01:42:14.910 --> 01:42:25.780]  Which is a slush fund for grifters, which is set up, as you know, as a vehicle for the facilitation of multi-million dollar bribes.
[01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:36.670]  So Trump poses an enormous threat to the Clintons, an enormous threat to the status quo in Washington, a threat to the political and ruling elites.
[01:42:36.670 --> 01:42:40.013]  Good God, if this man became president, he could uncover all of the government's
[01:42:41.374 --> 01:42:50.157]  Well look at how he says when no other candidate is saying this, that he wants to get rid of the tax exemption for these big hedge funds and mega banks and make them pay a modest amount.
[01:42:50.157 --> 01:42:52.918]  I mean, that would literally fix so many of our problems.
[01:42:52.918 --> 01:42:59.641]  I mean, those are the big globalist companies like Goldman Sachs that run the anti-gun agenda, that run the open border agenda.
[01:42:59.641 --> 01:43:01.322]  They're the ones, almost every time,
[01:43:02.262 --> 01:43:05.265]  The irony, of course, is that Trump knows all these people.
[01:43:05.265 --> 01:43:06.466]  He socializes them.
[01:43:06.466 --> 01:43:13.992]  They're desperate to get into his club in Palm Beach, the Mar-a-Lago Club, which is the most exclusive and sought-after private club in Florida.
[01:43:26.823 --> 01:43:34.789]  But I might also add, one of the few private clubs in Palm Beach that admits Jews and Hispanics and African Americans.
[01:43:34.789 --> 01:43:46.598]  So it is almost laughable to see the panic at the political elite level, and that's why this unprecedented smear against Trump.
[01:43:46.598 --> 01:43:52.202]  The irony of this, of course, is that it's having the exact reverse effect, in my opinion.
[01:43:52.762 --> 01:44:08.068]  Meaning, the more the elites attack Trump, the more the talking heads on CNN rip him, the more the rights previces of the Republican National Committee come forward and denounce him, the stronger he gets.
[01:44:08.068 --> 01:44:14.110]  Because it is a signal to average people that this guy must threaten the status quo.
[01:44:14.110 --> 01:44:16.951]  That he is a real harbinger of change.
[01:44:16.951 --> 01:44:20.353]  So, yesterday, there was a Bloomberg survey
[01:44:21.013 --> 01:44:34.744]  Which showed that two-thirds of Republican primary voters agreed with Trump when they were asked the narrow and fair question of whether they wanted a temporary halt in Muslim immigration.
[01:44:34.744 --> 01:44:43.251]  Of course, that's not what the mainstream media would have you believe he proposed, but there is overwhelming support for Trump's position.
[01:44:44.451 --> 01:44:52.396]  And I think that this also reflects a Reuters poll that was done on a daily tracking basis.
[01:44:52.396 --> 01:45:06.984]  While they didn't ask the precise question about Trump's proposal, they did look at Republican primary voter attitudes towards Muslims and the Muslim community, and they see the possibility of danger.
[01:45:06.984 --> 01:45:07.685]  They realize
[01:45:08.385 --> 01:45:20.731]  That of all these hundreds of thousands of immigrants who would like to come to this country, while I'm sure that many, many of them are decent, peace-loving people, Americans aren't stupid.
[01:45:20.731 --> 01:45:23.532]  They know that there's a terrorist contingent in there.
[01:45:24.052 --> 01:45:29.117]  Of course, this is a zone, Syria, where hundreds of thousands of jihadis invaded.
[01:45:29.117 --> 01:45:31.078]  They've gotten their butts handed to them.
[01:45:31.078 --> 01:45:33.861]  So now they're getting into Turkey and Europe and coming to the U.S.
[01:45:33.861 --> 01:45:35.382]  There's a good percentage of them.
[01:45:35.382 --> 01:45:37.864]  I mean, we got polls.
[01:45:37.864 --> 01:45:39.085]  He cited them.
[01:45:39.085 --> 01:45:39.646]  21%, 25%, 27%.
[01:45:39.646 --> 01:45:41.107]  We showed those last hour on screen.
[01:45:41.107 --> 01:45:42.148]  We'll show them again.
[01:45:42.148 --> 01:45:44.270]  Saying they support jihad and suicide bombers.
[01:45:44.910 --> 01:45:46.874]  And they've got fake passports, most of them.
[01:45:46.874 --> 01:45:48.236]  They're not even Syria.
[01:45:48.236 --> 01:45:50.339]  We would be insane to continue this.
[01:45:50.339 --> 01:45:55.528]  So what is the government thinking, bringing them in, knowing they're going to blow stuff up and shoot people?
[01:45:56.305 --> 01:45:57.726]  Yeah, it's really extraordinary.
[01:45:57.726 --> 01:46:08.371]  Of course, we had the lesson of Paris, where a terrorist moved seamlessly through that nation's immigrant process to mastermind the mass killings last week.
[01:46:08.371 --> 01:46:12.193]  I don't know how, to use Trump's words, how stupid can the American people be?
[01:46:12.193 --> 01:46:17.876]  I must tell you, I'm very comfortable about an election that is framed around these issues.
[01:46:18.576 --> 01:46:28.939]  I am very comfortable comparing Trump's proposal with Hillary Clinton's record on Middle Eastern issues and of course her closest... You mean her record of giving Stinger missiles to Al Qaeda?
[01:46:28.939 --> 01:46:29.960]  You mean that record?
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:42.043]  Well, the record of arming ISIS, because she's the one who armed them in her fury to try to depose Qaddafi and insert a regime that is loyal to... And now she says Trump's helping ISIS.
[01:46:42.043 --> 01:46:43.664]  You talk about upending reality.
[01:46:44.505 --> 01:46:46.646]  Yeah, it's Kafka-esque.
[01:46:46.646 --> 01:46:53.830]  It's typical big media, big government doublespeak where they say the exact opposite of what is true.
[01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:56.552]  The good news is the American people are waking up.
[01:46:56.552 --> 01:46:59.153]  They're not buying this line anymore.
[01:46:59.153 --> 01:47:00.414]  In my opinion, only Trump
[01:47:00.874 --> 01:47:04.976]  ...would put forward an aggressive strategy to crush ISIS.
[01:47:04.976 --> 01:47:11.938]  This pinprick approach that Barack Obama says he's utilizing clearly is not working at all.
[01:47:11.938 --> 01:47:25.543]  And then, you know, I am kind of interested because the other day Huma Abedin, also known as Mrs. Carlos Danger, the top aide to Hillary Clinton... Also known as Mrs. Hillary or Mrs. Hillary Clinton.
[01:47:25.543 --> 01:47:27.184]  Yeah, perhaps.
[01:47:27.184 --> 01:47:29.005]  But who is... Huma, Huma, Hillary, which one is the Mrs.?
[01:47:29.905 --> 01:47:31.926]  It is hard to say, isn't it?
[01:47:31.926 --> 01:47:32.706]  Yes.
[01:47:32.706 --> 01:47:34.727]  But look, Huma is beautiful.
[01:47:34.727 --> 01:47:36.608]  She's exotic.
[01:47:36.608 --> 01:47:38.228]  She's very chicly dressed.
[01:47:38.228 --> 01:47:40.129]  Good for Hillary!
[01:47:40.129 --> 01:47:42.910]  And she's completely loyal to the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:47:42.910 --> 01:47:46.432]  Her parents and her brothers are very active in the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:47:46.432 --> 01:47:51.514]  She has written for a Muslim Brotherhood-funded publication for many years.
[01:47:51.514 --> 01:47:54.275]  Her loyalty is not to the United States, so one must ask,
[01:47:54.935 --> 01:47:57.377]  How did she get a security clearance from the U.S.
[01:47:57.377 --> 01:47:58.437]  State Department?
[01:47:58.437 --> 01:48:01.299]  Or maybe she never had a security clearance.
[01:48:01.299 --> 01:48:14.548]  Maybe that's why Hillary had to use an outside server so that Huma could look at all those classified documents and then decide what we should be allowed to see and what we shouldn't be allowed to see.
[01:48:14.548 --> 01:48:14.929]  That's right.
[01:48:15.749 --> 01:48:30.142]  I mean, I must tell you, I spent many years in government as an aide to three presidents, and I never saw a situation in which an individual got a special waiver that allowed her to get a full-time salary at the State Department.
[01:48:30.142 --> 01:48:40.692]  At the same time, she's pulling down a second paycheck from Teneo, which is a Clinton-connected lobbying organization, which has clients that lobby the State Department.
[01:48:41.172 --> 01:48:47.613]  At the same time, whom is pulling down yet a third paycheck from the Clinton Foundation?
[01:48:47.613 --> 01:49:08.858]  Now we know that the Clinton Foundation and the State Department had business in the sense that many corporations, many foreign nations, many wealthy people realized if you had a big decision at State Department that meant millions of dollars to your pocket, you could buy American decision-making by giving enormous contributions to the Clinton Foundation.
[01:49:09.438 --> 01:49:15.541]  So, it really is a vehicle for the facilitation of these multi-million dollar bribes.
[01:49:15.541 --> 01:49:24.885]  Huma Abedin was right in the middle of that, and of course last week, or I should say earlier this week, Huma Abedin was among those denouncing Donald J. Trump.
[01:49:25.245 --> 01:49:28.567]  What could be a greater badge of honor than to be attacked by the mask?
[01:49:28.567 --> 01:49:30.468]  Well, she tried to imply he wanted to throw her out.
[01:49:30.468 --> 01:49:33.930]  I mean, maybe she should be thrown out after her loyalties are investigated.
[01:49:33.930 --> 01:49:42.895]  I mean, I'm sick of the arrogance of all these foreigners and people that just think America is this big doormat and that we're here to be culled and cowed into submission.
[01:49:42.895 --> 01:49:44.596]  But getting back to Donald Trump himself.
[01:49:45.476 --> 01:49:48.599]  Six months ago, when this stuff first started, I wasn't sure.
[01:49:48.599 --> 01:49:50.762]  I did more research.
[01:49:50.762 --> 01:49:52.924]  And then I saw where he was with so many policies.
[01:49:52.924 --> 01:49:54.665]  I saw how they demonized him.
[01:49:54.665 --> 01:49:57.829]  I saw how the big money came out against him.
[01:49:57.829 --> 01:50:00.672]  I saw the Republican leadership line up against him.
[01:50:00.672 --> 01:50:02.814]  All that was a better sign that he really was for real.
[01:50:04.113 --> 01:50:07.475]  Now I've seen him come out against the big banks being tax-exempt.
[01:50:07.475 --> 01:50:10.477]  I've seen him come out unequivocally for the Second Amendment.
[01:50:10.477 --> 01:50:14.200]  I've seen him come out for, you know, blowing up the ISIS oil fields.
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:17.362]  All this stuff is the opposite of what the establishment wants.
[01:50:17.362 --> 01:50:19.424]  He clearly knows what he's talking about.
[01:50:19.424 --> 01:50:21.405]  And then he talks about how our borders are gone.
[01:50:21.405 --> 01:50:23.106]  We're being brought into globalism.
[01:50:23.106 --> 01:50:24.127]  We're being shut down.
[01:50:24.127 --> 01:50:25.608]  We're being dismantled.
[01:50:25.608 --> 01:50:29.691]  And I'm just not hearing this out of anybody but Ted Cruz and a little bit out of Rand Paul.
[01:50:29.691 --> 01:50:31.272]  And I've supported, you know, both of them.
[01:50:31.272 --> 01:50:32.993]  I'd be happy with any three of those guys being president.
[01:50:33.473 --> 01:50:38.395]  But then I just love the fact that he calls out the media.
[01:50:38.395 --> 01:50:46.097]  He's already started a revolution in the debates where they all laugh at the moderators, who are basically political pundits.
[01:50:46.097 --> 01:50:53.979]  And I see the whole facade, the force field around the globalist, almost dissolving with just Donald Trump being a candidate.
[01:50:53.979 --> 01:50:55.320]  It's like, it's...
[01:50:56.946 --> 01:51:01.167]  Like, he's anti-matter to these people, and it really excites me.
[01:51:01.167 --> 01:51:08.908]  And the fact that he's not a coward, the fact that he is the man in the arena, the fact that he doesn't back down is so exciting.
[01:51:08.908 --> 01:51:19.870]  And that's what we need again, is someone who is an individual, someone who doesn't come from some weirdo, leftist cult, or some neocon cult, or some, you know, weird group.
[01:51:19.870 --> 01:51:24.891]  We need somebody who really does want to turn this country loose to do great things.
[01:51:24.891 --> 01:51:25.711]  And I'm sold.
[01:51:26.491 --> 01:51:28.072]  But Donald Trump's for real.
[01:51:28.072 --> 01:51:35.397]  I'm sold he really wants to cut taxes and bring back our sovereignty and kick criminals out of the nation and do all those things.
[01:51:35.397 --> 01:51:41.160]  I just ask myself, though, when he does shoot from the hip, he is teleprompter free.
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:42.861]  He is talking point free.
[01:51:42.861 --> 01:51:48.305]  What's brought him to this prominence could also be taken out of context to bring him down.
[01:51:48.305 --> 01:51:49.306]  But maybe that is
[01:51:50.430 --> 01:52:00.096]  A sign that the public has so much broken with the establishment that they don't care what they do to him, they're going to continue to support him.
[01:52:00.096 --> 01:52:07.161]  I want you to speak to that as a top presidential advisor, a guy that's run major campaigns around the world, Roger Stone, our guest.
[01:52:07.161 --> 01:52:11.164]  And then specifically, what are the dirty tricks they're going to pull?
[01:52:11.164 --> 01:52:19.009]  What is the mathematical electorate constellation that tells you he is electable in a general election, Roger Stone?
[01:52:21.621 --> 01:52:23.502]  Well, let's tackle those one by one.
[01:52:23.502 --> 01:52:28.943]  First of all, I have no question that he is the strongest possible candidate against Hillary Clinton.
[01:52:28.943 --> 01:52:37.786]  Even some of the preliminary polls, and I don't mean online polls where you can vote and then push refresh and vote again and then vote and push refresh and vote again.
[01:52:37.786 --> 01:52:49.070]  I'm talking about scientific-based polls with an accurate and carefully balanced, perfectly drawn sample show that Trump is already pulling unprecedented levels of blacks
[01:52:49.850 --> 01:52:52.392]  Catholics and union members.
[01:52:52.392 --> 01:52:55.253]  Individual rank and file union members.
[01:52:55.253 --> 01:53:02.338]  I believe that he could draw literally millions of people into the electoral process who have given up on politics.
[01:53:02.338 --> 01:53:04.399]  Are you talking about Reagan Democrats and people?
[01:53:04.399 --> 01:53:05.940]  Well, I think it's even beyond that.
[01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:07.261]  I think it's beyond Reagan Democrats.
[01:53:07.461 --> 01:53:22.013]  Yes, I think he can get those blue collar ethnic Democrats, those working class Democrats who are as sick of the elitism and the big government and the big spending and the big taxing policies and the low employment policies of Washington.
[01:53:22.013 --> 01:53:30.040]  But beyond that, I think there are millions of people who like you and I, Alex, realize that both parties have morphed into one party.
[01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:37.521]  That the choice that is presented to the voters, like the choice between Romney and Obama, is a false choice.
[01:53:37.521 --> 01:53:48.924]  That the two parties are the same, the parties of endless war, erosion of our civil liberties, massive debt, unhinged spending, the list goes on and on.
[01:53:48.924 --> 01:53:53.605]  So I think there are millions of Americans for whom Trump
[01:53:54.726 --> 01:53:56.808]  It looks like something different.
[01:53:56.808 --> 01:53:57.889]  A real reformer.
[01:53:57.889 --> 01:54:02.573]  I think he can pull those people back into the political process.
[01:54:02.573 --> 01:54:07.437]  And that is why he is the strongest potential Republican candidate.
[01:54:07.437 --> 01:54:12.202]  It aggravates me that people keep asking him, well, are you going to run as an independent?
[01:54:13.240 --> 01:54:15.502]  He's the frontrunner for the Republican nomination.
[01:54:15.502 --> 01:54:17.223]  Not by a little bit, by a lot.
[01:54:17.223 --> 01:54:18.564]  By 10 points.
[01:54:18.564 --> 01:54:20.005]  Why would he even consider it?
[01:54:20.005 --> 01:54:22.908]  With all due respect, go ask Rand Paul that question.
[01:54:22.908 --> 01:54:24.829]  He's running last.
[01:54:24.829 --> 01:54:28.412]  His father once bolted the GOP to run as an independent.
[01:54:28.412 --> 01:54:32.175]  Maybe it's a more appropriate question for Senator Paul at this point.
[01:54:32.175 --> 01:54:32.936]  I want to be clear.
[01:54:32.936 --> 01:54:33.696]  I don't want to run.
[01:54:34.631 --> 01:54:43.973]  Senator Rand Paul down, but I'm an honest person, and I knew him 20 years ago, back when he campaigned for his dad, when his district came into Austin.
[01:54:43.973 --> 01:54:51.936]  I've supported him, been nice to him, his dad comes on, total integrity, love the Pauls, but the way Rand gets advised now, the things he does,
[01:54:54.397 --> 01:54:57.899]  I mean, you notice Ted Cruz is smart and isn't attacking Trump.
[01:54:57.899 --> 01:55:05.644]  I just don't get it, and I really wanted Rand to be more aggressive, like a Trump, and it's just very sad.
[01:55:05.644 --> 01:55:09.966]  Yeah, no, look, I share your high regard for both Rand Paul and his father.
[01:55:09.966 --> 01:55:12.588]  The very last vote I cast as a Republican
[01:55:13.248 --> 01:55:18.272]  Was for Ron Paul in the Florida primary against Mitt Romney.
[01:55:18.272 --> 01:55:22.815]  And I'm an admirer of Rand Paul, although I think he seems to have lost his bearings here.
[01:55:22.815 --> 01:55:24.697]  I mean, I'm not sure who he is.
[01:55:24.697 --> 01:55:26.418]  You can't be all things to all men.
[01:55:26.418 --> 01:55:29.981]  You can't be both a libertarian and a traditional conservative.
[01:55:30.821 --> 01:55:34.764]  And then try to trim your foreign policy to show that you really are a statist.
[01:55:34.764 --> 01:55:39.788]  I just think his candidacy has failed and sadly I think it is over.
[01:55:39.788 --> 01:55:43.571]  But the personal attacks on Donald Trump, those I can't figure out.
[01:55:43.571 --> 01:55:44.672]  They have golfed together.
[01:55:44.672 --> 01:55:50.237]  I happen to know that Donald Trump likes Senator Paul and says, by the way, he's an exceptional golfer.
[01:55:50.237 --> 01:55:56.662]  So it is... Well that's probably why Trump's been snapping back at him because they were friends and then Paul makes crappy comments about him.
[01:55:57.222 --> 01:56:05.551]  Well, one thing I can tell you about Trump, having spent an enormous amount of time with him, if you punch Trump, you better be prepared to get punched back at twice the velocity.
[01:56:05.551 --> 01:56:06.953]  It's just his nature.
[01:56:06.953 --> 01:56:10.116]  Do not awaken the sleeping beast.
[01:56:10.116 --> 01:56:14.521]  If you attack Donald Trump, you better expect incoming and it'll be almost immediate.
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:18.702]  Well, moving on from Senator Paul, it's a sad story.
[01:56:18.702 --> 01:56:27.027]  Just kind of let the dead bury the dead politically at this point, unless he wakes up with those snot-nosed young Republicans he's got around him up there in his campaign.
[01:56:27.027 --> 01:56:31.370]  I don't mean to be mean, but that's just... I mean, you're talking about the tail wagging the dog here.
[01:56:31.370 --> 01:56:32.491]  I'm just going to say it and move on.
[01:56:35.157 --> 01:56:36.418]  How do we get behind Trump?
[01:56:36.418 --> 01:56:38.280]  How do we stop the dirty tricks?
[01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:39.621]  How do we get him into the presidency?
[01:56:39.621 --> 01:56:41.723]  Because nothing makes me like him more.
[01:56:41.723 --> 01:56:49.770]  I mean, I'm moving towards the 100% mark now, with all these wolves attacking and all these cowards piling on the one man in the arena.
[01:56:49.770 --> 01:56:51.312]  You're talking my language right there.
[01:56:52.438 --> 01:57:01.940]  Well, let me just predict right now that the next major attack on Trump will be a bogus claim that he is somehow mobbed up.
[01:57:01.940 --> 01:57:06.141]  There's a half-dozen news organizations who've been working on this for months.
[01:57:06.141 --> 01:57:14.983]  Now, what they don't seem to know is that Trump has, for over 15 years, held a New Jersey casino control operator's license.
[01:57:15.763 --> 01:57:22.149]  The New Jersey Casino Control Law is the most stringent law in the country.
[01:57:22.149 --> 01:57:26.913]  In other words, you can be denied a license just having met a mobster.
[01:57:26.913 --> 01:57:31.036]  You don't have to do business with them, you don't have to trade money with them, you don't have to buy anything from them.
[01:57:31.036 --> 01:57:36.681]  Just a social occasion in which you are together can be enough to deny you a license.
[01:57:36.681 --> 01:57:43.486]  They are very, very, very sensitive to organized crime influence in the gaming industry in New Jersey.
[01:57:43.486 --> 01:57:43.847]  By the way,
[01:57:44.187 --> 01:57:52.190]  The New Jersey law is so stringent, it is the model for most of the laws in the country that have legalized casino gambling.
[01:57:52.190 --> 01:57:58.412]  Donald Trump has been gone over by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission with a proctoscope.
[01:57:58.412 --> 01:57:59.753]  There is nothing there.
[01:57:59.753 --> 01:58:06.395]  Now, being in the construction industry in the Northeastern United States, has he met guys who are mob-connected?
[01:58:06.395 --> 01:58:07.696]  Probably.
[01:58:07.696 --> 01:58:08.996]  Is he in bed with the mob?
[01:58:08.996 --> 01:58:10.937]  In no way, shape, or form.
[01:58:11.617 --> 01:58:13.718]  And no one ever alleged that with his dad and people.
[01:58:13.718 --> 01:58:17.078]  It is hard to believe he's one of the only clean people, you know, in that whole thing.
[01:58:17.078 --> 01:58:21.059]  But he was the outsider, it was well known, that came in and broke into that.
[01:58:21.059 --> 01:58:22.100]  That's why he carried a gun.
[01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:22.860]  I mean, that's what I've read.
[01:58:22.860 --> 01:58:23.780]  Is that correct?
[01:58:23.780 --> 01:58:24.880]  That is absolutely right.
[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:26.821]  Donald Trump is squeaky clean.
[01:58:26.821 --> 01:58:33.562]  But be prepared for a mainstream media onslaught trying to claim that he is somehow mobbed up.
[01:58:33.562 --> 01:58:34.163]  Because that's coming back.
[01:58:34.163 --> 01:58:36.063]  So that's going to be the empire striking back.
[01:58:36.063 --> 01:58:36.683]  Stay there, sir.
[01:58:36.683 --> 01:58:37.964]  Back in 70 seconds.

[01:59:43.021 --> 01:59:45.542]  It's a long way to the top if you want to be present.
[02:00:10.143 --> 02:00:12.286]  As a part of a political combine like Obama.
[02:00:12.286 --> 02:00:16.293]  From the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.914 --> 02:00:29.741]  Roger Stone, I can tell you, is swift-boating the Clintons and the Bushes as a best-selling author with accurate info.
[02:00:29.741 --> 02:00:31.663]  I've read the Clinton's War on Women.
[02:00:31.663 --> 02:00:38.328]  I can't wait till the book on the Bush crime family, Jeb and the Bush crime family, comes out.
[02:00:38.328 --> 02:00:40.810]  These are both topics I'm very well-researched on.
[02:00:40.810 --> 02:00:44.813]  So when I hear Stone speaking to it, when he was on last time, it was so incredibly accurate.
[02:00:44.813 --> 02:00:45.634]  We'll cover some of that.
[02:00:46.514 --> 02:00:49.335]  Uh, coming up in the next segment, and then I promise I'll go to your calls.
[02:00:49.335 --> 02:00:54.956]  I'm sorry to Tony, Isaiah, Erica, Kevin, Dan, and others.
[02:00:54.956 --> 02:00:59.378]  I know I said I'd go to your calls, and then I didn't, and then the guests got on, but I will in the next segment.
[02:00:59.378 --> 02:01:02.979]  We'll get some of your calls out of the way with your comments and questions on Trump, I promise.
[02:01:05.430 --> 02:01:07.491]  It takes a lot of will.
[02:01:07.491 --> 02:01:13.454]  This fellow's worked directly with three presidents very closely, worked for many others as well, but you know, been in the Oval Office.
[02:01:13.454 --> 02:01:15.755]  And this is a very dangerous book.
[02:01:15.755 --> 02:01:24.540]  And the other one, from the facts he stated from it that I know to be true, because I'm an expert on these subjects, I've been living it for 20 years, interviewing all the people involved.
[02:01:24.540 --> 02:01:29.102]  I mean, the CIA pilots who were there unloading the cocaine with the Bushes and the Clintons.
[02:01:29.102 --> 02:01:31.743]  I mean, the Bushes and the Clintons totally work for each other.
[02:01:31.743 --> 02:01:32.524]  They are mafia.
[02:01:34.232 --> 02:01:36.054]  They are the mafia above the mafia.
[02:01:36.054 --> 02:01:43.183]  I mean, they denied until the 50s that Lacosa Nostra existed, and then it became only mafia was Italian.
[02:01:43.183 --> 02:01:44.124]  That's ridiculous.
[02:01:44.124 --> 02:01:46.707]  The real mob is above that.
[02:01:46.707 --> 02:01:52.695]  And really, Donald Trump, from what I've seen, is trying to break into their system with the people.
[02:01:53.530 --> 02:01:59.232]  But you look at the Bushes, the Clintons, to me they're the original mafia, the true mafia, you know, the term Arkansas.
[02:01:59.232 --> 02:02:07.275]  I mean, is that not an accurate statement, Roger Stone, that they better watch out throwing stones in glass houses because these are the true mafiosos?
[02:02:07.275 --> 02:02:08.535]  Yeah, there's no question.
[02:02:08.535 --> 02:02:12.056]  I refer to it as the Bush-Clinton crime syndicate.
[02:02:12.056 --> 02:02:16.098]  And my two books, The Clintons' War on Women and the upcoming Jeb,
[02:02:18.018 --> 02:02:20.179]  And the Bush crime family, they're really bookends.
[02:02:20.179 --> 02:02:35.903]  They're really complement each other in terms of detailing the profiteering and criminal activity that both families have conducted together, rehabilitating each other, profiteering together, boosting each other politically.
[02:02:35.903 --> 02:02:44.785]  You know, Alex, I had to reflect on that commercial that I just heard because, as you know, I cut my teeth in politics working for Richard Nixon.
[02:02:45.505 --> 02:02:49.849]  And Nixon was very, very proud of his martini-making talents.
[02:02:49.849 --> 02:02:55.453]  He made a mean martini, and he referred to them as silver bullets.
[02:02:55.453 --> 02:03:02.658]  So as soon as you would get to his place in Saddle Ridge, he would say, hey, how about a silver bullet?
[02:03:02.658 --> 02:03:05.421]  And then he himself would make you a very dry martini.
[02:03:06.161 --> 02:03:09.503]  And you would drink the martini and you say, wow, Mr. President, this is fabulous.
[02:03:09.503 --> 02:03:12.565]  And he said, yeah, let me tell you my recipe.
[02:03:12.565 --> 02:03:19.350]  He says, you take a bottle of olives, you drain the olives, you pour in vermouth, you put it in the refrigerator.
[02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:28.196]  Then when you're ready, you pour the vodka or gin over ice in your shaker, you make it as cold as possible, and you drop in one olive.
[02:03:28.196 --> 02:03:29.777]  And that way it's very dry.
[02:03:29.777 --> 02:03:31.919]  So, well, Mr. President, that's fabulous.
[02:03:31.919 --> 02:03:34.681]  He said, yeah, I got the recipe from Churchill.
[02:03:34.681 --> 02:03:34.921]  Wow.
[02:03:36.405 --> 02:03:40.706]  See, I just want to get you on time to talk about all these presidential stories because they're so interesting.
[02:03:40.706 --> 02:03:42.327]  And I don't romanticize Nixon.
[02:03:42.327 --> 02:03:43.427]  I know he had some problems.
[02:03:43.427 --> 02:03:44.487]  Many problems.
[02:03:44.487 --> 02:03:48.968]  But compared to other ones, I mean, he was one of the least criminal from what I've known.
[02:03:48.968 --> 02:03:54.310]  And that's why they took him out was because he wanted to actually be president and the bureaucracy wanted to be in charge.
[02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:54.930]  Is that accurate?
[02:03:55.450 --> 02:03:59.613]  Yes, and he was challenging the industrial complex war machine.
[02:03:59.613 --> 02:04:00.113]  Good.
[02:04:00.113 --> 02:04:01.474]  He ended the war in Vietnam.
[02:04:01.474 --> 02:04:03.555]  That cut into their profits.
[02:04:03.555 --> 02:04:07.658]  He opened the door to conversations with China and a relationship with China.
[02:04:07.658 --> 02:04:09.399]  And then he moved to the Seoul Agreement.
[02:04:09.399 --> 02:04:11.701]  So, Nixon turned out to be a peacemaker.
[02:04:11.701 --> 02:04:16.204]  That's not what the boys at the Pentagon or the Central Intelligence Agency had in mind.
[02:04:16.204 --> 02:04:18.405]  Now look, Nixon was far from perfect.
[02:04:18.405 --> 02:04:21.648]  Taking us off the gold standard, enormous mistake.
[02:04:21.648 --> 02:04:25.110]  The war on drugs, a big, expensive, inefficient mistake.
[02:04:25.730 --> 02:04:34.195]  I don't make the case, although I have great affection for Nixon and his personal resilience, I make no case that he was in any way perfect.
[02:04:34.195 --> 02:04:45.202]  But compared to the illegality, unconstitutionality of what we have today, Nixon would be rolling in his grave if he saw what Barack Obama and the Clintons have gotten away with.
[02:04:45.942 --> 02:04:47.023]  Absolutely, stay there.
[02:04:47.023 --> 02:04:48.945]  I want to come back, hit some phone calls with you.
[02:04:48.945 --> 02:04:50.806]  We got you for the rest of the hour.
[02:04:50.806 --> 02:04:55.670]  Then I want to get more into how we get behind Donald Trump because, I mean folks, the whole system's coming after him.
[02:04:55.670 --> 02:04:57.532]  That right there is the certification he's for real.
[02:05:00.416 --> 02:05:05.320]  Retired basketballer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is calling Trump the ISIS candidate.
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:12.865]  He says the GOP frontrunner is doing ISIS's work for them by preying on people's understandable fear to coerce support.
[02:05:12.865 --> 02:05:20.331]  According to Abdul-Jabbar, Trump's political stance might make people transcend abstraction and actually commit acts of violence.
[02:05:20.331 --> 02:05:25.475]  He fails to point out, though, the countless people on the left calling for violence against Trump.
[02:05:25.475 --> 02:05:29.398]  Now, naturally, there's been no condemnation against this violent and hateful rhetoric,
[02:05:29.818 --> 02:05:40.164]  Probably claiming it's justified because of Trump's crazy talk calling to temporarily halt Muslims from entering the country until the vetting process is fixed.
[02:05:40.164 --> 02:05:49.329]  Hillary calls this un-American and against our values, ignoring that this same policy was enacted by Jimmy Carter during the Iran-Contra scandal.
[02:05:49.329 --> 02:05:52.071]  Iranians were banned from entering the U.S.
[02:05:52.071 --> 02:05:55.112]  unless they opposed the Shiite Islamist regime.
[02:05:55.112 --> 02:05:57.734]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:05:59.676 --> 02:06:03.179]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:06:03.179 --> 02:06:11.445]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:06:11.445 --> 02:06:16.869]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:06:37.903 --> 02:06:41.186]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:06:41.186 --> 02:06:44.689]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:06:44.689 --> 02:06:46.430]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:06:46.650 --> 02:06:47.591]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:06:47.591 --> 02:06:48.752]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:06:48.752 --> 02:06:50.754]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[02:06:50.754 --> 02:06:57.520]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:06:57.520 --> 02:07:02.565]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[02:07:26.667 --> 02:07:35.529]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.

[02:08:13.308 --> 02:08:15.810]  The world is a dangerous place.
[02:08:15.810 --> 02:08:21.795]  Not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:08:21.795 --> 02:08:26.158]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:26.158 --> 02:08:30.341]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:08:30.341 --> 02:08:32.443]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:32.443 --> 02:08:39.068]  Take the children and yourself and hide out in the cellar.
[02:08:39.068 --> 02:08:42.150]  By now the fighting will be close.
[02:08:44.434 --> 02:08:55.464]  In the final equation, the elite have a 9% approval rating for Congress.
[02:08:55.464 --> 02:08:57.206]  The people are waking up in general.
[02:08:57.206 --> 02:09:02.190]  The attempt to flood the country with immigrants that are ignorant isn't going to work.
[02:09:02.190 --> 02:09:06.494]  The overall globalist strategy is collapsing.
[02:09:06.494 --> 02:09:08.957]  They have a strategy of tension to keep people in turmoil.
[02:09:09.966 --> 02:09:22.749]  But when they even use those systems on the first world, their command base, their funding, their power, their prowess, their good name, their soft power, in the end it brings these elites down as well.
[02:09:22.749 --> 02:09:29.530]  Rome did the same thing 1800 years ago, began its collapse.
[02:09:29.530 --> 02:09:30.830]  Took 200 years but it happened.
[02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:38.552]  Nowadays things happen a lot quicker and whether it's Europe or the United States, we see a willful suiciding
[02:09:39.947 --> 02:09:51.791]  Of the good institutions and of common sense by a criminal class that wants to loot like barbarian vagabonds or Visigoths the system itself.
[02:09:51.791 --> 02:09:57.673]  They want to kill the Golden Goose and I say that from a cynical perspective.
[02:09:57.673 --> 02:09:59.354]  I personally am chivalrous.
[02:09:59.354 --> 02:10:00.294]  I have a moral perspective.
[02:10:00.294 --> 02:10:01.695]  It's where my energy comes from.
[02:10:01.695 --> 02:10:02.995]  It's who I am.
[02:10:02.995 --> 02:10:04.236]  I'm looking for other people like me.
[02:10:06.547 --> 02:10:13.314]  But even as a sociopath, if I looked at it through those eyes, which I do, any general is supposed to look through their enemy's eyes.
[02:10:13.314 --> 02:10:18.280]  This doesn't even make sense until you realize it's their very instinct to screw everything up.
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:25.207]  We're going to ask Roger Stone about that, about knowing Donald Trump for decades, what really makes him tick.
[02:10:26.243 --> 02:10:36.856]  Because I think personalizing him is the one thing people really want to know about to commit their support for him, what he thinks they'll do to try to shut him down after the mob claims he says are coming.
[02:10:36.856 --> 02:10:38.739]  And I already see that drum beginning to beat.
[02:10:40.427 --> 02:10:51.253]  And then we'll get into other facets of this in general, where Mr. Stone sees the world going, and then have him back soon for another interview about presidents in general and politics.
[02:10:51.253 --> 02:11:01.058]  I want to talk about some of the delegate processes, some of the dirty tricks they might pull trying to keep Trump out, how we get involved in the delegate process, like my friend Richard Reeves is, to try to stop that.
[02:11:01.058 --> 02:11:07.262]  And that's a whole other interview as well, probably in person here, because I want Stone to be with us a lot because of his understanding of this.
[02:11:09.278 --> 02:11:11.761]  But now let's go to some phone calls.
[02:11:11.761 --> 02:11:14.625]  Again, the website is StoneZone.com.
[02:11:14.625 --> 02:11:21.854]  It's an excellent site with commentary, photos, analysis, decades with him working at the White House and his books.
[02:11:21.854 --> 02:11:23.896]  The new book is The Clinton's War on Women.
[02:11:24.697 --> 02:11:26.018]  And if you can find it, good luck.
[02:11:26.018 --> 02:11:29.762]  It's sold out in many areas, but we're trying to get 5,000 of them ourselves.
[02:11:29.762 --> 02:11:31.783]  Very hot book right now.
[02:11:31.783 --> 02:11:34.626]  But let's go to Tony in Tennessee.
[02:11:34.626 --> 02:11:35.267]  Thank you for holding.
[02:11:35.267 --> 02:11:36.147]  You're a trooper.
[02:11:36.147 --> 02:11:39.210]  Listening on WBCR 1470 AM.
[02:11:39.210 --> 02:11:39.871]  You're on the air.
[02:11:39.871 --> 02:11:41.812]  Go ahead.
[02:11:41.812 --> 02:11:43.113]  Oh, thanks for taking my call.
[02:11:43.113 --> 02:11:46.376]  I've been a listener since 99.
[02:11:46.376 --> 02:11:50.700]  You know, there's a special out there that everybody needs to go listen to.
[02:11:50.700 --> 02:11:51.241]  It's called
[02:11:51.972 --> 02:12:03.482]  You've been trumped down about four years ago, and this is what Donald Trump tried to do to the people over in Scotland because he wanted to build a golf course.
[02:12:03.482 --> 02:12:04.683]  He's not a nice guy.
[02:12:04.683 --> 02:12:13.650]  Now, I have heard that the one little chink people can bring up is imminent domain issues, and then that's brought up all day, and that's just what builders go through.
[02:12:13.650 --> 02:12:16.613]  I'm not saying that's perfect or that's fine.
[02:12:16.613 --> 02:12:20.516]  Let me ask you, would you rather have Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, or Jeb Bush then?
[02:12:21.676 --> 02:12:29.063]  Well, then there is also the matter of the $4 million that you just now gave your ex-wife in your recent divorce.
[02:12:29.063 --> 02:12:33.987]  Okay, none of that's true, and so that was some kind of weird seminar call right there.
[02:12:33.987 --> 02:12:38.031]  This is somebody, I guess, that just doesn't like this broadcast.
[02:12:38.031 --> 02:12:41.514]  Would you like to... and that's fine, make up whatever you want.
[02:12:41.514 --> 02:12:43.556]  Let's go ahead and get Roger Stone's take on that.
[02:12:45.483 --> 02:13:01.601]  You know, Donald Trump is a developer, and he has skepticism about so-called green energy, about this windmill technology, which turns out to be far more expensive than the older technologies to generate electricity.
[02:13:02.402 --> 02:13:05.966]  He's built some of the greatest golf courses in the world.
[02:13:05.966 --> 02:13:09.310]  He's built some of the greatest resorts in the world.
[02:13:09.310 --> 02:13:11.313]  In fact, he's climbed to the top of that mountain.
[02:13:11.313 --> 02:13:16.719]  That's why I think he's now turning his energy towards saving this country.
[02:13:16.719 --> 02:13:19.862]  He's done every great real estate development that you can have.
[02:13:19.862 --> 02:13:21.725]  Alex, this guy has a terrific life.
[02:13:22.365 --> 02:13:24.166]  He's got a beautiful family that he loves.
[02:13:24.166 --> 02:13:25.887]  He likes spending time with them.
[02:13:25.887 --> 02:13:28.208]  He's a scratch golfer and he loves to play golf.
[02:13:28.208 --> 02:13:36.731]  But instead, he's made 18 trips to Iowa on Saturdays to meet voters and roll out a campaign.
[02:13:36.731 --> 02:13:43.715]  There's no question, once he becomes president, he will be stepping down in terms of the quality of his airplane and his home.
[02:13:43.715 --> 02:13:51.118]  Not that there's anything wrong with Air Force One and the White House, but I've seen the Trump lifestyle and he lives like what he is, a self-made
[02:13:51.618 --> 02:13:52.980]  Billionaire.
[02:13:52.980 --> 02:14:02.072]  In all honesty, when we're talking about this nation's absolute survival, then a golf course in Scotland seems kind of mundane.
[02:14:05.438 --> 02:14:12.520]  I hate unmade people that made hundreds of millions like Hillary with her total elitism where you can't even look her in the eyes.
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:20.203]  This has been confirmed when she's at a hotel or being served by somebody, doesn't give people tips, treats them like total crud.
[02:14:20.203 --> 02:14:32.547]  I've gotten turned on to Trump more the last six months investigating him, talking to people that you don't even know, you know, he knows or knows, that say, big tipper, super nice, treats everybody so good, unless you mess with him, then he's pretty aggressive.
[02:14:34.027 --> 02:14:35.127]  This is the irony.
[02:14:35.127 --> 02:14:41.989]  For a guy who's worth $10 billion, probably more at this point, he's a regular guy.
[02:14:41.989 --> 02:14:43.949]  He's very, very funny.
[02:14:43.949 --> 02:14:45.769]  He's got a great sense of humor.
[02:14:45.769 --> 02:14:47.930]  He loves a good cheeseburger.
[02:14:47.930 --> 02:14:50.630]  He's got a risque sense of humor.
[02:14:50.630 --> 02:14:51.910]  He's fun to be with.
[02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:57.891]  Working for Trump, I can honestly tell you, over the years, I've worked on and off for him for 37 years.
[02:14:57.891 --> 02:14:59.312]  It has always been fun.
[02:14:59.312 --> 02:15:00.592]  I've had a good time.
[02:15:01.112 --> 02:15:08.874]  Well, I actually like the fact that he'll go on a lot of wild shows, not just mine, but something like Howard Stern, when all these other fake stuff suits wouldn't do it.
[02:15:08.874 --> 02:15:11.175]  We need somebody that'll get in there and get their hands dirty.
[02:15:11.175 --> 02:15:14.775]  I'm sick of all this fake elitism, and I did look into the whole thing.
[02:15:14.775 --> 02:15:22.377]  You know, he pays for it, he gets it, there's a plan for a golf course, then people start wanting more money, and then you run over them and build a golf course.
[02:15:22.377 --> 02:15:23.338]  Could you say it's bad?
[02:15:23.338 --> 02:15:24.478]  Could you say it's good?
[02:15:24.478 --> 02:15:25.978]  Wait until you're in those shoes.
[02:15:25.978 --> 02:15:28.679]  The question is, do you want, would you rather have Hillary Clinton?
[02:15:29.659 --> 02:15:33.361]  And then the guy didn't respond to that, he just made something up.
[02:15:33.361 --> 02:15:35.962]  Well, look, that was a crank call as far as I'm concerned.
[02:15:35.962 --> 02:15:51.189]  Here's what's interesting, and that is that I love the way Trump, for example, last night with Don Lemon on CNN, or last weekend with Chuck Todd, where he won't be bullied by these commentators, where he cuts them off.
[02:15:51.829 --> 02:15:56.552]  And he says, no wait a minute Chuck, cool it, cool down Chuck.
[02:15:56.552 --> 02:16:10.760]  Or when he says last night to Don Lemon, excuse me, excuse me, when they try to cut him off, which as you know is a classic media stunt to try to dominate these and bully these political figures.
[02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:13.242]  Well that's what they try with me and I just do it right back to them.
[02:16:13.242 --> 02:16:13.942]  They can't stand it.
[02:16:13.942 --> 02:16:15.643]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:16:15.643 --> 02:16:18.465]  Let's go ahead and talk to Isaiah in California.
[02:16:18.465 --> 02:16:19.546]  You're on the air with our guest.
[02:16:21.989 --> 02:16:23.070]  Alex, how's it going?
[02:16:23.070 --> 02:16:23.490]  Good, brother.
[02:16:23.490 --> 02:16:24.950]  Go ahead.
[02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:33.134]  Hey, I just want to say thank you for putting me on the air and I want to kind of give a shout out to your InfoWars life.
[02:16:33.134 --> 02:16:35.415]  I have a lot of your products and they're awesome.
[02:16:35.415 --> 02:16:36.696]  Thank you.
[02:16:36.696 --> 02:16:39.797]  But that's besides the point.
[02:16:39.797 --> 02:16:41.698]  I want to say Trump, he's a fighter.
[02:16:41.698 --> 02:16:44.639]  You know, you guys have been kind of talking about that.
[02:16:44.639 --> 02:16:46.160]  And he's ruthless, man.
[02:16:46.733 --> 02:16:49.456]  I think he's good for America.
[02:16:49.456 --> 02:16:55.181]  Of course, I'm always skeptical of any kind of politician myself.
[02:16:55.181 --> 02:16:58.705]  But, you know, people are going to attack him.
[02:16:58.705 --> 02:17:01.367]  They're going to continuously attack him.
[02:17:01.367 --> 02:17:04.510]  And I think he's kind of got the goal for it.
[02:17:04.510 --> 02:17:07.954]  And I believe, you know, even if he doesn't win this war,
[02:17:08.536 --> 02:17:10.736]  He's already done a lot of damage just by running the race.
[02:17:10.736 --> 02:17:11.397]  I agree.
[02:17:11.397 --> 02:17:14.497]  He's brought a lot of stuff into the agenda that they don't want on the agenda.
[02:17:14.497 --> 02:17:16.478]  And this is what I want to say about Trump.
[02:17:16.478 --> 02:17:18.098]  They've tried to emasculate us.
[02:17:18.098 --> 02:17:24.039]  They've tried to destroy the image of an aggressive, dominant male because they want a nation of servile cowards.
[02:17:24.039 --> 02:17:31.021]  And if we were already super aggressive, super male and attacking a bunch of places and, you know, doing bad things,
[02:17:31.821 --> 02:17:39.586]  Then I would sit there and say, we don't need something like this, but we have a bureaucracy that does all these bad things in our name, but then wants us weak.
[02:17:39.586 --> 02:17:52.334]  And Donald Trump clearly has the type of attitude and confidence that America needs, and he wants 10% growth rates a year, not these fake 3% that are really negative.
[02:17:52.334 --> 02:17:59.319]  He wants to have not a monopoly economy, but a big burgeoning economy, because he's made his money off of there being a wealthy economy.
[02:17:59.759 --> 02:18:02.462]  And he talks about this and he wants America to win.
[02:18:02.462 --> 02:18:10.192]  And the fact that he'd want America to win, all these politicians like Obama and others, they want to graduate up to the world government level.
[02:18:10.192 --> 02:18:15.298]  They want to be the ones that mounted America's head on the wall and made us the globalists
[02:18:15.638 --> 02:18:18.940]  You know, bitch, basically, to use, you know, for lack of a better word.
[02:18:18.940 --> 02:18:21.162]  That's why they hate Trump so much.
[02:18:21.162 --> 02:18:24.144]  And he doesn't want to be part of their club.
[02:18:24.144 --> 02:18:26.105]  He builds his own clubs.
[02:18:26.105 --> 02:18:27.986]  And so that's Americana.
[02:18:27.986 --> 02:18:29.387]  And that's why they hate him so much.
[02:18:29.387 --> 02:18:31.389]  Is that an accurate statement, Roger Stone?
[02:18:31.389 --> 02:18:32.569]  I think that's exactly right.
[02:18:32.569 --> 02:18:35.311]  Look, Trump has built one of the great fortunes of all time.
[02:18:35.311 --> 02:18:38.113]  And now he wants to make the American people rich.
[02:18:38.113 --> 02:18:39.894]  Trump stands for success.
[02:18:39.894 --> 02:18:45.058]  He stands for prosperity, for full employment, for opportunity.
[02:18:45.518 --> 02:18:52.524]  This is why I think those who say, oh, he's not going to get any Hispanic votes, he's not going to get any African American, they're completely wrong.
[02:18:52.524 --> 02:18:58.909]  There are aspirational people in those groups of Americans who want a piece of the pie.
[02:18:58.909 --> 02:19:01.071]  They want their own success.
[02:19:01.071 --> 02:19:03.953]  Trump is, above all, a capitalist.
[02:19:03.953 --> 02:19:07.476]  And he believes that this country could be restored to greatness.
[02:19:07.476 --> 02:19:12.520]  Look, take, for example, his plan to cut the corporate tax rate, which is currently 35,
[02:19:13.981 --> 02:19:15.742]  China is 25.
[02:19:15.742 --> 02:19:18.203]  Trump would cut it to 15.
[02:19:18.203 --> 02:19:28.387]  Literally overnight, all these multinational corporations doing business in China would come home because suddenly it would be more profitable to do business here.
[02:19:28.387 --> 02:19:28.787]  Exactly.
[02:19:28.787 --> 02:19:33.889]  The globalists did that to make our jobs, the basis of them, go overseas as a plan to sabotage us.
[02:19:34.389 --> 02:19:34.970]  Exactly.
[02:19:34.970 --> 02:19:41.035]  Trump would reverse that process, and you would have one of the greatest economic booms this country has ever seen.
[02:19:41.035 --> 02:19:46.901]  There's $2 trillion offshore that's being kept offshore to avoid taxation.
[02:19:46.901 --> 02:19:49.303]  That's right, but he would make them bring that money back, and that's good.
[02:19:49.303 --> 02:19:49.944]  Stay there.
[02:19:49.944 --> 02:19:50.564]  That's important.
[02:19:50.564 --> 02:19:51.665]  Isaiah, thank you.
[02:19:51.665 --> 02:19:58.912]  Erica, Kevin, Dan, your calls are up next with Roger Stone, and I'm going to give him the floor coming up in about 20 minutes to just speechify.

[02:22:22.588 --> 02:22:32.592]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:22:32.592 --> 02:22:39.094]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:22:39.094 --> 02:22:42.455]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[02:22:42.455 --> 02:22:44.496]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:22:44.496 --> 02:22:47.597]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:22:47.637 --> 02:22:50.102]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[02:24:06.272 --> 02:24:08.014]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:24:08.014 --> 02:24:10.236]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:10.236 --> 02:24:16.442]  And the author, Roger Stone, of The Clinton's War on Women, is our guest.
[02:24:16.442 --> 02:24:19.344]  But he is a bipartisan truth teller.
[02:24:19.344 --> 02:24:26.571]  He's got a new book that's bookends with it, coming out on Jeb Bush and the Bush crime family.
[02:24:26.571 --> 02:24:27.632]  Bush crime syndicate.
[02:24:29.189 --> 02:24:31.830]  Put out by Sky Horse Publishing.
[02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:35.591]  We're going to go to Dan in Texas and others here in a moment, but here's some of the bad news.
[02:24:35.591 --> 02:24:39.173]  Connecticut to ban gun sales to no-fly listers.
[02:24:39.173 --> 02:24:41.834]  So that's literally lynching due process.
[02:24:41.834 --> 02:24:44.395]  The no-fly list is something to terrorize people.
[02:24:44.395 --> 02:24:46.155]  These shooters weren't on the no-fly list.
[02:24:46.155 --> 02:24:50.597]  She was allowed in without proper vetting, just as Trump has warned.
[02:24:50.597 --> 02:24:54.519]  And so now he says he's going to integrate into the no-fly list database.
[02:24:54.519 --> 02:24:55.399]  So federalizing.
[02:24:57.301 --> 02:24:58.622]  With a state executive order.
[02:24:58.622 --> 02:25:02.004]  That's totally unconstitutional, how those two things come together.
[02:25:02.004 --> 02:25:03.445]  And that's USA Today.
[02:25:03.445 --> 02:25:15.554]  How can a governor's executive order trump, no pun intended, the fact that there isn't even a federal law on this yet, but claim he's going to use a federal database at a state level to deny it?
[02:25:15.554 --> 02:25:18.676]  I mean, that violates federalism.
[02:25:18.676 --> 02:25:21.378]  It violates so many different angles of our system.
[02:25:24.150 --> 02:25:27.392]  The people didn't even get their guns illegally and they weren't on no-fly list.
[02:25:27.392 --> 02:25:37.979]  This is so amazing that they're doing this and then they're the ones that help bring these people in and then point their finger at us.
[02:25:39.687 --> 02:25:44.031]  Mr. Stone, knowing Trump so well, obviously he's been responding to this.
[02:25:44.031 --> 02:25:46.794]  He gets more and more hardcore on the Second Amendment.
[02:25:46.794 --> 02:25:50.178]  What's your view on this and where this fight for the Second Amendment is going?
[02:25:50.178 --> 02:25:54.202]  Because I would have said this is a fraud having a state make its own law on guns, but
[02:25:55.768 --> 02:25:56.689]  It's really extraordinary.
[02:25:56.689 --> 02:25:58.970]  Look, Donald Trump is a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.
[02:25:58.970 --> 02:26:01.832]  As you know, he himself has a concealed carry permit in New York.
[02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:19.381]  He is packing heat a lot of the time.
[02:26:19.381 --> 02:26:21.361]  He's smart enough not to tell us when.
[02:26:21.361 --> 02:26:30.123]  You can imagine how many death threats he's had, not just in this campaign, but an entire career of being outspoken and being forthright.
[02:26:30.123 --> 02:26:39.746]  He rejects utterly the whole notion that San Bernardino could somehow have been changed or avoided if we just had more stringent gun laws.
[02:26:39.746 --> 02:26:44.467]  I thought he was masterful last night on CNN, arguing that the exact opposite was true.
[02:26:44.847 --> 02:26:50.528]  That if people in San Bernardino had been armed, some of them, the outcome might have been quite different.
[02:26:50.528 --> 02:26:55.489]  So he takes a backseat to no one in his support of the Second Amendment.
[02:26:55.489 --> 02:27:06.511]  In New Hampshire, in Iowa, in South Carolina, gun enthusiasts, firearms owners, I think, form the backbone of much of his organizational support.
[02:27:06.511 --> 02:27:13.152]  And I know that he is counting, he and his team are counting very heavily on gun owners for support in these early contests.
[02:27:13.872 --> 02:27:17.254]  I remember during that debate, he said he carries a gun, and they went, how dare you?
[02:27:17.254 --> 02:27:22.558]  You're worth billions of dollars, have death threats, El Chapo saying he wants to kill you, and you have a gun?
[02:27:22.558 --> 02:27:27.841]  But Hillary can have bodyguards, Dianne Feinstein can have a concealed carry, but not you!
[02:27:27.841 --> 02:27:31.443]  A police officer can, but not you!
[02:27:31.443 --> 02:27:33.205]  What a crazy idea!
[02:27:33.205 --> 02:27:35.646]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dan in Texas.
[02:27:35.646 --> 02:27:39.729]  You're on the air with one of his top advisors, Mr. Stone.
[02:27:41.311 --> 02:27:44.373]  Yes, Mr. Jones, Mr. Stone, it's an honor to speak with both of you.
[02:27:44.373 --> 02:27:45.994]  Go ahead, brother.
[02:27:45.994 --> 02:28:11.131]  Yes, so I know you both know that these elections are just one tool for people who want to basically write every paragraph of the history books, but constantly their plans are backfiring when you have inconvenient contingencies like, Mr. Jones, your documentaries, Mr. Stone, your books that you've put out.
[02:28:11.826 --> 02:28:14.667]  Putin doing airstrikes on ISIS.
[02:28:14.667 --> 02:28:22.849]  I'll tell you why I think that the 2016 election is an uninsured liability.
[02:28:22.849 --> 02:28:40.434]  It's basically the same thing that Obama capitalized on in 2008, which is the public is so sick, to the nth degree, of these PC, milquetoast politicians, but at the same time, the public is also given pop culture
[02:28:41.677 --> 02:28:48.581]  Which gives us these figures, these rappers, these reality TV people, comedians.
[02:28:48.581 --> 02:28:53.924]  And then they're supposed to satisfy some kind of primal thing.
[02:28:53.924 --> 02:29:01.328]  And then we're told these billionaires like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, these corrupt ones, are our saviors.
[02:29:01.328 --> 02:29:05.371]  But yet all these things are supposed to be kept separate like the milk and the meat plate.
[02:29:05.371 --> 02:29:07.872]  They're never supposed to come together into a candidate.
[02:29:08.926 --> 02:29:14.193]  And so the, you know, it's just, it's so foolish for them to think that they... Exactly!
[02:29:14.193 --> 02:29:17.057]  The elites aren't gods, they don't control everything.
[02:29:17.057 --> 02:29:23.465]  Napoleon and Hitler thought they were invincible, but world events are turning against them and that's a great place to end that call.
[02:29:23.465 --> 02:29:24.186]  We'll come back.
[02:29:24.186 --> 02:29:26.288]  I'm going to tell you about...
[02:29:27.423 --> 02:29:29.004]  Something very interesting for a few minutes.
[02:29:29.004 --> 02:29:34.008]  We're going to give Mr. Stone about a five-minute break, and then we're going to come back to him, have him comment on what you just said.
[02:29:34.008 --> 02:29:35.909]  Is history turning against the tyrants?
[02:29:35.909 --> 02:29:38.191]  Is Trump just a manifestation of that, a bellwether?
[02:29:38.191 --> 02:29:44.255]  And then we're going to give him the floor on whatever he wants to talk about, right through to the end of the hour, and more calls as well.
[02:29:44.255 --> 02:29:46.656]  I'm Alan Jones with InfoWars.com.
[02:29:46.656 --> 02:29:49.078]  The book, The Clinton's War on the Women, by Roger Stone.
[02:29:49.078 --> 02:29:49.799]  Get it today.
[02:29:49.799 --> 02:29:50.659]  March.
[02:29:50.659 --> 02:29:53.201]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.201 --> 02:29:55.883]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.975 --> 02:30:08.599]  A recent hearing on climate change featuring three prominent scientists who are actually skeptical of man-made global warming resulted in a heated exchange.
[02:30:08.599 --> 02:30:25.007]  Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey invoked Galileo when he harped the science is settled, essentially calling climatologist Judith Curry a denier for believing that this could be something God made rather than something that is man-made and backed by science.
[02:30:25.407 --> 02:30:28.488]  Are you saying there's no natural variability, Senator?
[02:30:28.488 --> 02:30:31.009]  There were alligators at the North Pole.
[02:30:31.009 --> 02:30:31.729]  What was that?
[02:30:31.729 --> 02:30:33.370]  Was that you in your SUV?
[02:30:33.370 --> 02:30:37.532]  And be prepared for the climate change cult to be even more in your face.
[02:30:37.532 --> 02:30:41.333]  The UN announced the organization of a civil society PR campaign.
[02:30:41.753 --> 02:30:56.690]  This propaganda tsunami will be used to bolster the UN's climate deal, which calls for a hundred billion dollar annual transfer from rich to poor nations, and of course taxes, penalties, and a global police force to guarantee our submission.
[02:30:56.690 --> 02:30:59.293]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[02:30:59.753 --> 02:31:14.341]  My fellow patriots, one of the things I'm most proud of is the fact that the InfoWars operation reaches more than 20 million people a week worldwide with a message of liberty, and none of it is funded by major global corporations or by taxpayers.
[02:31:14.341 --> 02:31:16.182]  It's funded by free will.

[02:32:11.261 --> 02:32:16.264]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:32:33.913 --> 02:32:38.074]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.
[02:32:38.074 --> 02:32:43.015]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.

[02:33:04.625 --> 02:33:11.147]  Fear is the passion of slaves, and this man knows no fear.
[02:33:11.147 --> 02:33:16.648]  He is Alex Jones.
[02:33:16.648 --> 02:33:18.509]  Boy, they are writing these liners now.
[02:33:18.509 --> 02:33:22.730]  I'm not, and it just sounds how heroic I am.
[02:33:22.730 --> 02:33:24.091]  Actually, I do have some fear.
[02:33:24.091 --> 02:33:28.612]  A fear of letting these tyrants rule my life and dominate and totally control me.
[02:33:28.612 --> 02:33:29.812]  It's fight and flight.
[02:33:29.812 --> 02:33:30.672]  I've decided to fight.
[02:33:30.672 --> 02:33:31.873]  So has our guest, Roger Stone.
[02:33:31.873 --> 02:33:32.173]  And listen,
[02:33:33.587 --> 02:33:49.596]  I can't sit here and be wishy-wash in a key election like this and be political like everybody else and just sit back and join the big pillory throwing tomatoes at Donald Trump in the proverbial stocks all tied up in the town square.
[02:33:49.596 --> 02:33:50.997]  He may not be perfect.
[02:33:50.997 --> 02:33:54.259]  I may be wrong about all this, but they're all piling on.
[02:33:54.259 --> 02:33:55.879]  What he's saying is true.
[02:33:55.879 --> 02:33:57.100]  He's being demonized.
[02:33:57.100 --> 02:34:00.302]  He's not playing politics as usual.
[02:34:00.302 --> 02:34:00.942]  That's why I am
[02:34:03.499 --> 02:34:08.482]  Supporting Trump and his message against the establishment.
[02:34:08.482 --> 02:34:20.650]  Because regardless, the things he's saying about our open borders, about gun control, about Islamic terrorism, about taking on ISIS, about taxing the big megabanks, but then also setting it up with lower tax rates so they bring their money back here.
[02:34:20.650 --> 02:34:28.175]  They'll probably have a MSNBC piece go, lower their taxes to tax them to bring it back here.
[02:34:28.175 --> 02:34:31.518]  Yes, they're basically tax exempt the way it's set up right now.
[02:34:31.518 --> 02:34:32.899]  That's why they wrote these laws.
[02:34:33.709 --> 02:34:39.753]  So, that's why more and more I'm supporting Donald Trump, just in his message, period.
[02:34:39.753 --> 02:34:44.016]  I'd be happy with a Ted Cruz, a Rand Paul, a Donald Trump, or a mix of those.
[02:34:44.016 --> 02:34:47.679]  But right now, he is the major frontrunner, gaining steam.
[02:34:47.679 --> 02:34:50.861]  The book, The Clinton's War on Women, Roger Stone.
[02:34:50.861 --> 02:34:55.184]  Now, before we go any further, I don't really know of CJ's view completely on Trump.
[02:34:55.184 --> 02:34:57.486]  He's been working here for three or four years, doing a great job.
[02:34:58.442 --> 02:34:58.883]  We're good to go.
[02:35:12.372 --> 02:35:16.815]  Just the best vetted technology in solar panels for the price.
[02:35:16.815 --> 02:35:19.056]  We can give you a wide shot of it if you're a TV viewer.
[02:35:19.056 --> 02:35:23.139]  Infowars.com forward slash show if you're a radio listener and want to see this.
[02:35:23.139 --> 02:35:33.125]  But whether it's for your hunting shack or part of your house or for your fishing cottage, whatever the case is, it is mobile like a suitcase.
[02:35:33.125 --> 02:35:34.886]  You can roll around.
[02:35:34.886 --> 02:35:36.587]  It's got the solar panels that come with it.
[02:35:37.426 --> 02:35:52.669]  And the price, from what I've seen when I agreed to order these months ago and do this deal, is roughly half of the competitor, and they don't even have as much power, and it's not even the best solar panels, it's just people keep selling the stuff that's 10 years old.
[02:35:52.669 --> 02:36:03.351]  This is the latest, greatest for the price, and if this is successful, which I believe it will be, it'll become a staple of preparedness products that we sell at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:36:04.031 --> 02:36:11.578]  But it is the Infowar Solar Base Station Power Supply, and CJ, who's a big fan of it, is here.
[02:36:11.578 --> 02:36:13.279]  He volunteered to come in and talk about it.
[02:36:13.279 --> 02:36:20.145]  CJ, also David Knight ran in and pointed out, you can get a federal tax credit for this system.
[02:36:20.145 --> 02:36:24.690]  So describe to us why you're such a fan of the Infowar Solar Base Station Power Supply.
[02:36:26.045 --> 02:36:30.209]  Most importantly, the benefits, I think, outweigh even the cost of this.
[02:36:30.209 --> 02:36:48.446]  Tim Frege had recommended I speak about this, because I've had some experience building homebrew solar systems, essentially to supplement electrical costs, and it's always been a lot more work than I felt it was worth, simply because of the cost of the panels, the technology lagging behind, in order to get
[02:36:49.281 --> 02:36:51.401]  Excellent panels of the greatest quality.
[02:36:51.401 --> 02:36:54.602]  You need to look at products years in advance.
[02:36:54.602 --> 02:37:05.224]  And I think what's great about this is it's a monocrystalline panel instead of polycrystalline panels, which are simply separate pieces of material that absorb light and convert it to energy.
[02:37:05.224 --> 02:37:08.104]  This is similar to perfect surface copper.
[02:37:08.104 --> 02:37:15.045]  In electrical terms, you get more energy or more efficiency out of a smoother surface.
[02:37:15.045 --> 02:37:17.646]  And so the panels themselves are fantastic.
[02:37:18.106 --> 02:37:18.686]  They're rugged.
[02:37:18.686 --> 02:37:23.889]  They've got what looks to be extruded aluminum protecting them.
[02:37:23.889 --> 02:37:25.510]  They'll fold in half.
[02:37:25.510 --> 02:37:28.071]  It's about the size of a large slim suitcase.
[02:37:28.071 --> 02:37:30.952]  The company that's building these wants to take over the market.
[02:37:30.952 --> 02:37:32.333]  They don't want to put crap out.
[02:37:32.333 --> 02:37:33.233]  Not at all.
[02:37:33.233 --> 02:37:35.594]  Similar pieces of equipment go for about $5,000.
[02:37:36.815 --> 02:37:41.318]  So when I say it's half the cost, it's way, way less than half.
[02:37:41.318 --> 02:37:45.021]  It's quite a bit less than half, to get something of similar value.
[02:37:45.021 --> 02:37:49.084]  And I don't believe they're all implementing these batteries.
[02:37:49.084 --> 02:37:59.372]  The quality of the batteries, I think, is fantastic because it's a lithium iron or lithium ferrous type cell.
[02:37:59.372 --> 02:38:03.395]  It's going to last a lot longer than a lithium polymer or a conventional lithium ion.
[02:38:04.495 --> 02:38:15.440]  It's discharge rate is going to be a little bit slower, but because of what it is and because of the durability, you get a lot more charges and discharges out of this kind of cell.
[02:38:15.440 --> 02:38:18.102]  I believe it's up to 2,000.
[02:38:18.102 --> 02:38:22.444]  Let's just be clear, there's only 98 of these, I should say, because I'm getting two of them myself.
[02:38:24.886 --> 02:38:29.509]  You gotta have this one in your house as backup and also one portable when you go camping or whatever.
[02:38:29.509 --> 02:38:32.932]  I mean, this is... I keep using the term because that's what I tell my guys.
[02:38:32.932 --> 02:38:34.353]  I want game changers.
[02:38:34.353 --> 02:38:42.780]  I want the best reviewed, highest quality, bang for your buck, companies that are aggressively wanting to dominate markets, who don't just want to be, you know, sitting on their laurels.
[02:38:42.780 --> 02:38:44.842]  And the folks we got this from are awesome.
[02:38:44.842 --> 02:38:46.923]  We private labeled it to also have this price.
[02:38:46.923 --> 02:38:48.585]  The leading competitor is why I kept saying
[02:38:48.865 --> 02:38:51.327]  I immediately thought of my grandmother when I saw it.
[02:38:51.327 --> 02:38:52.527]  She lives in a very rural area, has COPD,
[02:39:12.521 --> 02:39:17.243]  Has an oxygen machine, has a CPAP and a nebulizer.
[02:39:17.243 --> 02:39:19.785]  And when the power goes out, they do have a generator.
[02:39:19.785 --> 02:39:23.126]  It's noisy, but it relies on a steady supply of gasoline.
[02:39:23.126 --> 02:39:26.828]  And if you're snowed in and you can't get that, the sun is still there.
[02:39:26.828 --> 02:39:36.233]  And what makes it great is that even in overcast situations, like you'll find in winter, it's going to absorb almost as much as a conventional solar panel on a cloudy day.
[02:39:36.781 --> 02:39:37.503]  Wow.
[02:39:37.503 --> 02:39:42.576]  Other specs about the new Infowar Solar Base Station Power Supply at InfowarStore.com.
[02:39:43.924 --> 02:39:47.287]  Along with an AC outlet, you've got 12-volt outlets.
[02:39:47.287 --> 02:39:52.491]  12 volts at, I believe, 20 amps, so you can charge a car.
[02:39:52.491 --> 02:40:01.978]  If you don't have a portable charger, and you have this in your car, for example, while traveling, going hunting, camping, fishing, and you need to charge a battery, it's capable of that.
[02:40:01.978 --> 02:40:09.484]  It does come with that LED work lamp, which in the event of darkness, you've got a full battery and you need to work on something.
[02:40:10.284 --> 02:40:11.686]  You've got light available.
[02:40:11.686 --> 02:40:17.891]  And a lot of the panels fold together and fit so nicely for transportability as well.
[02:40:17.891 --> 02:40:19.212]  And durability.
[02:40:19.212 --> 02:40:20.593]  It's got a protective casing around it.
[02:40:20.593 --> 02:40:24.136]  Most of the panels that I purchased in the past were very fragile.
[02:40:24.136 --> 02:40:30.422]  You basically set them up somewhere and try not to touch them again because they're subject to cracking.
[02:40:30.422 --> 02:40:32.604]  This is very, very sturdy.
[02:40:34.639 --> 02:40:38.341]  Well I hope that you'll work with the guys since you're so knowledgeable about this.
[02:40:38.341 --> 02:40:47.265]  I know Tim spent years, for years I said get me the best small portable solar unit and we would just look at reviews or find out what we could get and it just
[02:40:49.013 --> 02:40:50.934]  It just had too many problems, too many issues.
[02:40:50.934 --> 02:40:57.376]  We finally found something that I can really get behind, and the price is so low, it's so high quality.
[02:40:57.376 --> 02:41:06.098]  For people that want to really have portable power, these are amazing units, and it's something not just for preparedness, but just for everyday life.
[02:41:06.098 --> 02:41:08.059]  It's very, very, very, very exciting.
[02:41:08.459 --> 02:41:09.099]  It is.
[02:41:09.099 --> 02:41:15.723]  For everyday life, you can put one of these in your house, and in some states, you qualify for a tax credit up to 30% of the cost.
[02:41:15.723 --> 02:41:21.225]  Some states would require that you somehow permanently attach it or hire an electrician to run the leads in.
[02:41:21.225 --> 02:41:27.969]  It's not necessary for safety to hire an electrician for the DC leads, being that it's DC low voltage, it's not a huge fire risk.
[02:41:27.969 --> 02:41:32.251]  But in order to qualify for a tax credit, you may want to look into it, contact an accountant.
[02:41:32.251 --> 02:41:35.392]  But even for home use, if you'd like to shave maybe a few
[02:41:41.154 --> 02:41:41.694]  Absolutely.
[02:41:41.694 --> 02:41:45.855]  So, if you did use this over a year or so, you'd get your money back?
[02:41:45.855 --> 02:41:46.776]  More than likely.
[02:41:46.776 --> 02:41:48.296]  You'd certainly get the peace of mind back.
[02:41:48.296 --> 02:41:50.377]  That's certain.
[02:41:50.377 --> 02:41:54.958]  I think it's the most innovative thing we've decided to release in our store since the G-Shock watches.
[02:41:55.859 --> 02:41:58.061]  I carry one because we work in broadcast.
[02:41:58.061 --> 02:41:59.022]  Well, that's a no-brainer.
[02:41:59.022 --> 02:42:02.525]  I mean, they're really high-quality watches that are super tough and everybody loves.
[02:42:02.525 --> 02:42:03.446]  It's military-grade.
[02:42:03.446 --> 02:42:06.949]  It receives perfect time, six times a day, shortwave.
[02:42:06.949 --> 02:42:09.311]  And I feel naked without it being in radio.
[02:42:10.635 --> 02:42:13.217]  And all the Special Forces guys have them because they are the best.
[02:42:13.217 --> 02:42:15.378]  We have them discounted at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:42:15.378 --> 02:42:17.159]  And it is your purchasing that makes it all possible.
[02:42:17.159 --> 02:42:20.502]  We have free shipping in the store until December 18th.
[02:42:20.502 --> 02:42:26.265]  And we've got a bunch of specials running right now at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:42:26.265 --> 02:42:32.209]  But this is definitely a great Christmas gift to your family, to yourself, to your loved ones, and to others.
[02:42:32.209 --> 02:42:34.711]  But I mean, obviously, you don't want to buy this for your son or daughter if they're not
[02:42:35.211 --> 02:42:40.194]  Somewhat technical, it's super easy to use, but, you know, people aren't into this type of stuff and you probably don't want to give it to them.
[02:42:40.194 --> 02:42:46.217]  But how many people do you know that are into preparedness or are into hunting or are into being off the grid?
[02:42:46.217 --> 02:42:52.021]  This really is innovative and it's great to see the technology getting better and better and so much more stable.
[02:42:52.021 --> 02:42:57.044]  The system is really worried about ubiquitous use of solar panels as they get better and better coming out.
[02:42:57.044 --> 02:43:00.726]  That's why they're trying to force people to dial them in to the central power grid.
[02:43:01.806 --> 02:43:03.968]  So they can control the whole thing.
[02:43:03.968 --> 02:43:05.710]  This is about decentralization.
[02:43:05.710 --> 02:43:06.750]  C.J., thank you so much.
[02:43:06.750 --> 02:43:07.231]  You're welcome.
[02:43:07.231 --> 02:43:07.471]  Thank you.
[02:43:07.471 --> 02:43:09.092]  All right, there goes C.J., folks.
[02:43:09.092 --> 02:43:16.238]  We're going to go back now to our guest, the Clinton's war on women, Roger Stone.
[02:43:16.238 --> 02:43:24.164]  And we're going to be getting him on to talk more about that and to talk about the callers last question.
[02:43:24.164 --> 02:43:27.687]  Is there a major political realignment happening?
[02:43:27.687 --> 02:43:28.488]  And we do know
[02:43:29.088 --> 02:43:36.132]  That there is a major political realignment that is taking place.
[02:43:36.132 --> 02:43:42.255]  And so everything we see out there is about scrambling political discourse, creating racial and religious divisions.
[02:43:43.531 --> 02:43:45.893]  To keep all that stirred up.
[02:43:45.893 --> 02:43:48.034]  So going back to Roger Stone.
[02:43:48.034 --> 02:43:50.475]  Roger, you heard the caller earlier.
[02:43:50.475 --> 02:43:57.700]  He was saying he thinks that the political elite now used to have the Midas touch because they had America's goodwill behind us.
[02:43:57.700 --> 02:44:01.922]  They had the world believing what we said even if we weren't perfect.
[02:44:01.922 --> 02:44:07.606]  We've lost that moral high ground now and the world doesn't believe our elite even when they tell the truth.
[02:44:07.606 --> 02:44:09.547]  But that old quote, I forget who said it,
[02:44:11.488 --> 02:44:15.091]  For who the gods would destroy, they would first make mad.
[02:44:15.091 --> 02:44:23.338]  And I know that's kind of attributed to a lot of different historians, but it does seem as if our elite are degenerating quickly.
[02:44:23.338 --> 02:44:34.828]  Can you speak to the political climate worldwide as an expert, as an advisor to so many presidents, and where you see the world going, and what you would expect Donald Trump to do if he was elected president?
[02:44:36.107 --> 02:44:37.468]  Well, this is pretty simple.
[02:44:37.468 --> 02:44:47.658]  The countries around the world are looking to see whether we're going to continue to be patsies, whether we're going to be China's bitch when it comes to trade, or Japan's, or Mexico.
[02:44:47.658 --> 02:44:51.522]  They're going to see if our military is going to continue to be allowed to atrophy.
[02:44:53.164 --> 02:44:55.828]  And get to the point where we can barely defend ourselves.
[02:44:55.828 --> 02:45:02.518]  They're going to see whether this printing press monetary system of ours will continue to destroy our dollar.
[02:45:02.518 --> 02:45:08.147]  They're going to see whether we are going to continue to go deeper and deeper and deeper into debt.
[02:45:08.647 --> 02:45:11.908]  They're going to see whether we keep spending like drunken sailors.
[02:45:11.908 --> 02:45:14.228]  And by the way, here's a bipartisan problem.
[02:45:14.228 --> 02:45:17.269]  Republicans and Democrats together are responsible.
[02:45:17.269 --> 02:45:27.351]  When the Republicans held the House under George W. Bush and a Republican administration, their record on spending would make Franklin Roosevelt blush.
[02:45:27.351 --> 02:45:31.652]  So it is, you know, there is disgust with the two-party system.
[02:45:31.652 --> 02:45:33.112]  On the other hand, Alex, I must tell you,
[02:45:33.812 --> 02:45:45.042]  I was very proud to say that I helped former Governor Gary Johnson, who I know has been on with you many times, get on the ballot in 48 states because the American people were ready for something new.
[02:45:45.042 --> 02:45:52.689]  70% of the people in the polls in that election told us that they wish there was another choice, and of course there was another choice.
[02:45:52.689 --> 02:45:58.855]  It was the two-term, accomplished, tax-cutting, pro-growth, pro-peace, pro-pot,
[02:46:00.498 --> 02:46:16.268]  Governor of New Mexico, and of course the Presidential Commission on Debates, which is not appointed by the President, not a commission, and most certainly not about debate, was determined to keep this man off the stage.
[02:46:16.268 --> 02:46:21.371]  What if people knew there was a candidate who wanted to repeal the Patriot Act?
[02:46:21.371 --> 02:46:25.753]  Or who wanted to bring all of our troops home from Afghanistan?
[02:46:25.753 --> 02:46:27.554]  The meat grinder.
[02:46:27.554 --> 02:46:30.096]  Who wanted to legalize marijuana and tax it.
[02:46:31.648 --> 02:46:33.971]  What would have happened if people knew that guy was in the race?
[02:46:33.971 --> 02:46:36.253]  So I'm very jaundiced about the system.
[02:46:36.253 --> 02:46:42.059]  Trump has chosen to make his stand within the Republican Party, and I am with him.
[02:46:42.059 --> 02:46:46.044]  And if he is the Republican nominee, I'm going to do everything personally possible.
[02:46:46.044 --> 02:46:47.445]  I want to be very clear.
[02:46:47.445 --> 02:46:50.729]  I have no formal or informal role in his campaign.
[02:46:51.269 --> 02:46:52.709]  We are friends.
[02:46:52.709 --> 02:46:53.670]  It's that simple.
[02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:55.310]  I am not compensated.
[02:46:55.310 --> 02:47:02.511]  I'm very interested in selling the Clinton's war on women because I think it is the information, Alex, that Trump is going to need.
[02:47:02.511 --> 02:47:09.533]  I think there's several ways to take Hillary down, and that's a whole broader discussion that you and I need to have.
[02:47:09.533 --> 02:47:16.414]  I want you to get into any other facets we haven't raised, obviously, because I've been directing things, and you've got a lot more gravitas on the political inside workings.
[02:47:16.414 --> 02:47:18.254]  I'd like to hear that with your perspective.
[02:47:18.254 --> 02:47:20.375]  But separately, let's expand on this.
[02:47:21.320 --> 02:47:29.996]  My big fear has always been, and I believe you Offair and others saying, no Trump probably won't do that, but the Republicans have betrayed him.
[02:47:29.996 --> 02:47:32.681]  He said, as long as the Republicans don't attack me and don't demonize me.
[02:47:33.934 --> 02:47:35.195]  Don't call for me to step down.
[02:47:35.195 --> 02:47:39.276]  I will pledge to stay in the Republican primary.
[02:47:39.276 --> 02:47:41.357]  Well, obviously that's got the machine, the muscle.
[02:47:41.357 --> 02:47:42.817]  That's a smart move.
[02:47:42.817 --> 02:47:48.019]  Now he's saying, hey, I may leave if you keep trying to basically politically assassinate me.
[02:47:48.019 --> 02:47:49.800]  And they spend that like he's breaking a pledge.
[02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:51.461]  Now, I remember what his pledge was.
[02:47:51.461 --> 02:47:54.462]  He's not breaking the pledge, but specifically still
[02:47:55.663 --> 02:48:04.068]  I know he's probably just trying to leverage him, correct me if I'm wrong, but he shouldn't let them kick him out or run him out.
[02:48:04.068 --> 02:48:06.309]  What is Trump really saying about that?
[02:48:06.309 --> 02:48:07.430]  I mean, what's the real Trump going to do?
[02:48:07.430 --> 02:48:11.232]  I think it's very unlikely that he will have to run as an independent.
[02:48:11.232 --> 02:48:12.913]  Therefore, when people ask me about it,
[02:48:14.353 --> 02:48:18.396]  It's a it's a it's a it's a MacGuffin in all honesty at this point.
[02:48:18.396 --> 02:48:22.278]  Does he have the name ID and the financial resources to do that?
[02:48:22.278 --> 02:48:22.778]  Yes.
[02:48:22.778 --> 02:48:29.101]  So let's put it in perspective because my friend Richard Reeves is I think very concerned about this.
[02:48:29.101 --> 02:48:37.986]  If they play the kind of shenanigans with the rules at the convention or in any part of the process that they used to cheat
[02:48:38.906 --> 02:48:52.776]  Ron Paul, out of his fair share of delegates and his say at the convention, where he was a non-person, they wouldn't even call his name in the role, the official role of the convention, even when he had legally won delegates.
[02:48:52.776 --> 02:48:59.100]  What kind of graciousness is that on the part of Mitt Romney, who had the votes to be nominated at that time?
[02:48:59.100 --> 02:49:06.625]  If they move to keep Trump out of the debates, if they move to keep him off the ballot, which some Republican Secretary of State
[02:49:07.543 --> 02:49:08.664]  Can do.
[02:49:08.664 --> 02:49:22.413]  Then I think under that circumstances, it may be the only route for him to the White House, and therefore, in my opinion, to the potential salvation of this country, because no one else is going to really change things.
[02:49:22.413 --> 02:49:33.461]  The two-party duopoly, the Bush-Clinton war machine, profiteering machine, will continue to try to curtail our civil liberties and make money off of them.
[02:49:33.701 --> 02:49:35.364]  I am now completely sold.
[02:49:35.364 --> 02:49:38.228]  I mean, Mr. Stone, you always have the right answer.
[02:49:38.228 --> 02:49:40.212]  You've backed so many great candidates.
[02:49:40.212 --> 02:49:41.914]  It's so good to see a political analyst.
[02:49:43.459 --> 02:49:45.541]  Who actually is telling the truth.
[02:49:45.541 --> 02:49:46.361]  That's it.
[02:49:46.361 --> 02:49:52.566]  The only time Trump should run third party is if they cheat him in the delegate process and have Jeb Bush in there.
[02:49:52.566 --> 02:49:55.269]  Then who wouldn't want Trump to run?
[02:49:55.269 --> 02:49:57.290]  Fine, Hillary or Jeb.
[02:49:57.290 --> 02:49:59.012]  It's time to go after both of them.
[02:49:59.012 --> 02:50:00.773]  You've got the books out on them.
[02:50:00.773 --> 02:50:02.214]  I kind of see a pincer attack here.
[02:50:02.214 --> 02:50:08.059]  I kind of see some planning behind the scenes that will really give them a run for their money.
[02:50:08.059 --> 02:50:12.763]  And it's good to see some guys with brains, you and Trump, really giving these criminals a run for their money.
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:17.985]  Well, look, I think Hillary Clinton is going to be very, very formidable, Alex.
[02:50:17.985 --> 02:50:21.589]  And she's going to have an enormous amount of Wall Street money.
[02:50:21.589 --> 02:50:26.255]  The idea of her ever reigning in Wall Street is laughable.
[02:50:26.255 --> 02:50:31.782]  And she and her husband have many, many, let's call them assets in the media.
[02:50:32.622 --> 02:50:41.826]  Who are, you know, who go to great lengths to cover up all of their blemishes, their many blemishes, in their outright criminal record.
[02:50:41.826 --> 02:50:50.750]  Their record of lies, deception, drugs, sexual assault, cover-up, lies upon more lies upon more lies.
[02:50:50.750 --> 02:50:58.173]  Only today I saw a video in which Hillary Clinton is now attempting to say that she never claimed
[02:50:59.938 --> 02:51:10.268]  That an anti-Islamic video shown one time in Turkey had caused the attack on the American mission in Benghazi.
[02:51:10.268 --> 02:51:12.490]  I wrote a book on this for Skyhorse.
[02:51:12.490 --> 02:51:18.676]  It's a short book, but if you want to know what Hillary did wrong in Benghazi, go to Amazon and buy my book on Benghazi.
[02:51:18.676 --> 02:51:19.757]  I took the Senate report.
[02:51:20.437 --> 02:51:25.780]  But I gave you a roadmap up front that explained what the Senate report was saying and what it showed you.
[02:51:25.780 --> 02:51:28.822]  I think it makes the case that Hillary lied about that.
[02:51:28.822 --> 02:51:44.390]  Now she's out on the campaign trail and she says to her stooge, George Stephanopoulos, donor to the Clinton Foundation, but interviewing her on television, therefore posing as a journalist, when she's asked, did you say that this was tied to a video, she said, no.
[02:51:46.277 --> 02:51:47.978]  That's a horrific lie.
[02:51:47.978 --> 02:51:51.401]  That's as bad as Obama saying he never said that you could keep your doctor.
[02:51:51.401 --> 02:51:54.023]  I mean, this is a new level of lying.
[02:51:54.023 --> 02:52:06.354]  No, no, and the families for the four immediately contacted the family of the parents of the four brave Americans who were murdered in Benghazi and lost their lives.
[02:52:06.354 --> 02:52:10.857]  The parents are outraged because that is not what she looked in the eye and told them.
[02:52:10.857 --> 02:52:14.861]  So we know everybody had this great celebration about her hearings.
[02:52:15.973 --> 02:52:19.717]  And how terrific how she was before the Senate.
[02:52:19.717 --> 02:52:22.640]  I think that that is not true.
[02:52:22.640 --> 02:52:25.763]  I think that she was caught in more and more big lies.
[02:52:25.763 --> 02:52:33.130]  For example, this notion that she emailed the Egyptian ambassador and her own daughter, Chelsea.
[02:52:34.159 --> 02:52:52.469]  Uh, after the attack saying we've been attacked by Al Qaeda, when she's telling the world this cover story about an Islamic video, which is essentially a cover-up because they didn't want to admit in the run-up to the presidential election that was only weeks away, that they had
[02:52:53.329 --> 02:52:53.870]  Uh, uh.
[02:53:09.344 --> 02:53:10.265]  of the establishment.
[02:53:10.265 --> 02:53:12.246]  This is how Bush runs against Clinton.
[02:53:12.246 --> 02:53:14.387]  It's not Republican-Democrat.
[02:53:14.387 --> 02:53:17.729]  It's their different factions of an aristocracy.
[02:53:17.729 --> 02:53:21.692]  Yeah, it's like the Harvard lacrosse team playing the other Harvard lacrosse team.
[02:53:21.692 --> 02:53:24.333]  Well, the Rockefellers and the Kennedys both wanted power.
[02:53:24.333 --> 02:53:25.494]  They wanted to be the guy.
[02:53:25.494 --> 02:53:29.776]  Don't think that they weren't fighting inside the club.
[02:53:29.776 --> 02:53:36.521]  And the guys in the club, like Henry Luce and Tom Dewey and other kingmakers, are choosing sides.
[02:53:37.741 --> 02:53:40.023]  April Harriman, Prescott Bush.
[02:53:40.023 --> 02:53:44.306]  And you can see the whole sniveling, snot-nosed establishment against Donald Trump.
[02:53:44.306 --> 02:53:45.948]  And at first I said, could this be fake?
[02:53:45.948 --> 02:53:47.349]  But it's obviously real.
[02:53:47.349 --> 02:53:48.630]  It's obviously happening.
[02:53:48.630 --> 02:53:51.792]  He will be destroyed to a great extent if he doesn't win.
[02:53:51.792 --> 02:53:52.433]  He knows that.
[02:53:52.433 --> 02:53:53.173]  He says, what am I going to do?
[02:53:53.173 --> 02:53:54.314]  Go watch TV?
[02:53:54.314 --> 02:53:55.975]  He's being banned off television.
[02:53:55.975 --> 02:53:58.077]  He's losing a bunch of his big franchises.
[02:53:58.077 --> 02:54:00.739]  He's losing hundreds of millions of dollars every few weeks here and there.
[02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:03.220]  Well, he clearly loves the fight.
[02:54:31.741 --> 02:54:33.382]  He's having the time of his life.
[02:54:33.382 --> 02:54:38.386]  You know, watching him be silly and stuff on other TV shows, entertainment, you know, it's just, you know, he's having fun.
[02:54:38.386 --> 02:54:53.496]  But once he gets in the fight, you can really see that it's just good to see that male stamina, you know, not the fake slimy type we normally see, but the real deal, loving the fight, not caring, committed to the fight, not worried if he gets caught up.
[02:54:53.496 --> 02:54:54.497]  That's why they're so scared of him.
[02:54:54.497 --> 02:54:54.917]  It's beautiful.
[02:54:54.917 --> 02:54:56.618]  I want to take a few phone calls here.
[02:54:56.618 --> 02:55:00.761]  We got Kevin, Jeff, Erica, Monique in Canada, Kevin and so many others.
[02:55:01.461 --> 02:55:04.642]  Let's go to Monique in Canada.
[02:55:04.642 --> 02:55:06.642]  Monique, you're on the air with Roger Stone.
[02:55:06.642 --> 02:55:08.122]  Go ahead.
[02:55:08.122 --> 02:55:16.984]  Hi, I'm reading many of your channel and different channels because I'm on defending the kids for the books they're pushing in the schools.
[02:55:16.984 --> 02:55:17.484]  Yes.
[02:55:17.484 --> 02:55:25.386]  I even had a legal restriction on me given one year because I complained books that were for 12 plus given to nine years old.
[02:55:25.386 --> 02:55:29.087]  So... Yeah, Canada under political correctness has a lot of censorship.
[02:55:29.087 --> 02:55:30.727]  What's your take on the Donald Trump situation?
[02:55:32.168 --> 02:55:47.457]  I'm reading about lots in the French media and stuff, they're pushing that there's an international boycott of protests organizing against Trump because they're pushing, the media are pushing that Trump
[02:55:47.992 --> 02:55:48.172]  Yes.
[02:56:05.572 --> 02:56:14.397]  Alex, I frankly think that the fundamental question here is they're trying to, this canard that Trump is somehow recruited by Bill Clinton and in league with the Clintons
[02:56:32.106 --> 02:56:41.074]  I can tell you, having known him this long and having been around and witnessed firsthand, by the way, Hillary wanted to come to Donald's wedding.
[02:56:41.074 --> 02:56:46.678]  Her staff tried to overrule her and she insisted on coming to Donald's wedding.
[02:56:46.678 --> 02:56:50.261]  He is the wealthiest man in the state of New York, most likely.
[02:56:50.261 --> 02:56:51.102]  She was the U.S.
[02:56:51.102 --> 02:56:53.283]  Senator from New York.
[02:56:55.745 --> 02:57:00.488]  You can imagine the glitterati that was at Trump's wedding.
[02:57:00.488 --> 02:57:02.049]  So she wanted to attend.
[02:57:02.049 --> 02:57:04.851]  Hillary knew there were some hot chicks there.
[02:57:04.851 --> 02:57:10.414]  No, I'm sure it was a CNBC thing and Hillary went because it was a political coup for her.
[02:57:10.834 --> 02:57:14.798]  Trump is a very popular man in his home state.
[02:57:14.798 --> 02:57:19.923]  But the notion that he is in the tank, which Jeb is trying to push, that's nonsense.
[02:57:19.923 --> 02:57:27.370]  The other notion that I think is similar, of course, is that some people draw parallels between Ross Perot and Trump.
[02:57:27.370 --> 02:57:27.971]  I knew Perot.
[02:57:28.967 --> 02:57:34.830]  And I knew his people, and I think they put on a very valiant fight with a lot of amateurs.
[02:57:34.830 --> 02:57:39.492]  But, Perot, as you know, threatened the status quo, as Trump did.
[02:57:39.492 --> 02:57:42.933]  He was an independent billionaire, as Trump is.
[02:57:42.933 --> 02:57:45.114]  He would have brought real reform to Washington.
[02:57:45.114 --> 02:57:49.236]  He was neither left nor right in the sense that he was a populist with conservative ideas.
[02:57:49.236 --> 02:57:51.937]  But they threatened to kill his family, so he got out.
[02:57:51.937 --> 02:57:53.597]  So he folded.
[02:57:53.597 --> 02:57:54.418]  Trump wouldn't do that.
[02:57:54.998 --> 02:57:56.419]  I can't see Trump doing that.
[02:57:56.419 --> 02:58:00.341]  Trump is, he's already got Secret Service protection.
[02:58:00.341 --> 02:58:08.627]  He is, along with Ben Carson, because they are controversial figures, and that is appointed by the President.
[02:58:08.627 --> 02:58:11.969]  They have their own personal security, which we of course cannot talk about.
[02:58:13.109 --> 02:58:14.910]  But Trump's not a quitter.
[02:58:14.910 --> 02:58:16.331]  He's not a folder.
[02:58:16.331 --> 02:58:19.752]  And he certainly won't be bullied out of this race.
[02:58:19.752 --> 02:58:27.236]  He's a shrewd individual and he will assess the race and he will be a candidate as long as he is viable.
[02:58:27.236 --> 02:58:30.237]  I frankly think that he will win before that time.
[02:58:30.237 --> 02:58:31.038]  I hope that's the case.
[02:58:31.038 --> 02:58:31.798]  I know you've got to go soon.
[02:58:31.798 --> 02:58:33.319]  Do five more minutes with us.
[02:58:33.319 --> 02:58:35.520]  RogerStone, StoneZone.com.
[02:58:35.520 --> 02:58:36.460]  Get the book.
[02:58:36.460 --> 02:58:40.502]  I want to ask you why he thinks, with the numbers, why he thinks Trump can win.
[02:58:40.502 --> 02:58:41.163]  This is important.
[02:58:41.163 --> 02:58:41.483]  Stay with us.
[02:58:42.173 --> 02:58:45.903]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:45.903 --> 02:58:47.427]  Finley & Maggott is coming up.
[02:58:49.790 --> 02:58:50.350]  I want my candy!
[02:58:50.350 --> 02:58:51.511]  I want my baby again!
[02:58:51.511 --> 02:58:51.711]  Mine!
[02:58:51.711 --> 02:58:52.972]  Mine!
[02:58:52.972 --> 02:58:53.092]  Mine!
[02:59:19.770 --> 02:59:20.090]  I think?
[02:59:52.293 --> 03:00:01.119]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.119 --> 03:00:04.120]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[03:00:04.120 --> 03:00:09.304]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[03:00:09.304 --> 03:00:15.327]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[03:00:15.327 --> 03:00:18.429]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[03:00:18.429 --> 03:00:21.271]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that
[03:00:23.550 --> 03:00:27.632]  So Donald Trump, can he be El Presidente?
[03:00:27.632 --> 03:00:31.093]  Will they plan the collapse on him after he gets in?
[03:00:31.093 --> 03:00:38.277]  Looking at the tea leaves, Roger Stone, longtime friend, advisor to Donald Trump, now in unofficial capacity, joins us.
[03:00:38.277 --> 03:00:41.618]  In closing, what is the arithmetic?
[03:00:41.618 --> 03:00:45.140]  What is the cumulus showing us that he is the guy to win?
[03:00:46.769 --> 03:00:53.674]  Well, as I said earlier, I think he can pull millions of voters into the process who are not in the process today.
[03:00:53.674 --> 03:00:59.578]  People who have given up on American politics and see the futility of the two-party system.
[03:00:59.578 --> 03:01:12.447]  And I think he will run ahead of those traditional levels of Republicans like Romney and McCain among African Americans, among Caribbean Americans, among Asian Americans.
[03:01:12.447 --> 03:01:14.168]  I think he can cut into the
[03:01:15.629 --> 03:01:18.011]  Some of the core democratic groups.
[03:01:18.011 --> 03:01:31.101]  And then he has to bring a whole bunch of people who've given up on politics of all across section of the election, but who are just disgusted back into the process.
[03:01:31.101 --> 03:01:37.566]  These huge crowds that he's pulling, when you examine them, you have a lot of registered millennial
[03:01:40.083 --> 03:01:41.085]  A millennial sort of thing.
[03:01:47.372 --> 03:01:52.494]  Who all admit to you, no, I haven't voted recently, or it's been a couple years, or I stopped voting.
[03:01:52.494 --> 03:01:54.195]  One woman told me, I stopped voting.
[03:01:54.195 --> 03:01:57.096]  It just encourages them, as she said.
[03:01:57.096 --> 03:01:59.897]  So, no, I think that that's a part of it.
[03:01:59.897 --> 03:02:02.998]  But the other reason I think he can win is more strategic.
[03:02:02.998 --> 03:02:07.640]  And that is all of the underpinnings of Hillary's candidacy can be knocked out from under her.
[03:02:07.640 --> 03:02:10.601]  Number one, she is not an advocate for women and girls.
[03:02:11.221 --> 03:02:14.066]  She is an abuser of women and girls.
[03:02:14.066 --> 03:02:17.772]  Bill is a Cosby-type sexual predator.
[03:02:17.772 --> 03:02:19.895]  He has attacked literally dozens of women.
[03:02:21.176 --> 03:02:34.664]  Hillary has been the point officer to cover up these vicious attacks on women, either sexual assault or raping them, or in some cases exposing himself and demanding oral sex.
[03:02:34.664 --> 03:02:41.527]  Bill Clinton is an addict, but Hillary Clinton has been his enabler, and more importantly, Alex, she has run the cover-up.
[03:02:41.527 --> 03:02:45.930]  Secondarily, she says, I'm an advocate for children.
[03:02:47.311 --> 03:02:52.375]  You know, we now know that it was Hillary who gave the final order at Waco.
[03:02:52.375 --> 03:03:03.243]  It was Hillary who ordered her former lover and law partner, Webster Hubble, to tell Janet Reno to authorize the attack at Waco.
[03:03:03.243 --> 03:03:04.304]  The brutal assault.
[03:03:04.304 --> 03:03:06.926]  And she brags about destroying and making Libya a failed state.
[03:03:06.926 --> 03:03:07.927]  She's a very sick freak.
[03:03:08.467 --> 03:03:19.861]  Where 18 children under 8 were killed, she's an advocate for women, is just as bogus as the idea that Hillary Clinton is an advocate for women and girls.
[03:03:19.861 --> 03:03:26.910]  And then there's of course the multi-billion dollar global fraud of the Clinton administration.
[03:03:27.370 --> 03:03:29.392]  Those are the three legs of the spool.
[03:03:29.392 --> 03:03:50.148]  If you expose the grafting corruption of the Clinton Foundation, you expose a record on women and children, and the Clintonian abuse of people and their scramble of power and wealth, and their greedy little daughter, who's just a brat, who is described in the New York Post as foul-mouthed, short-tempered, abusive,
[03:03:51.168 --> 03:03:54.650]  You know, I think it's time the American people learn about Hillary.
[03:03:54.650 --> 03:04:04.015]  Yeah, should America be ruled by permanent political class scum that literally can't even wipe their own noses and are spoiled brats just running all over us?
[03:04:04.015 --> 03:04:10.219]  I'm sick of these people and I would think the establishment would want to get rid of these people, but it's just such a cowardly establishment.
[03:04:10.219 --> 03:04:13.701]  They love it, even as they destroy their own power base.
[03:04:13.701 --> 03:04:17.183]  You know, even to the elite, Mr. Stone, you and Trump are doing everybody a favor.
[03:04:17.543 --> 03:04:21.787]  I mean, even to the elite, they ought to know that the red lights are coming on the engine.
[03:04:21.787 --> 03:04:23.009]  It's time to do an overhaul.
[03:04:23.009 --> 03:04:32.018]  Look, the idea that Chelsea Clinton says, I don't care about money, but Alex, she lives in a $10.5 million penthouse apartment.
[03:04:32.018 --> 03:04:33.740]  Her wedding costs $3.5 million.
[03:04:33.740 --> 03:04:35.662]  That's the classic disconnect!
[03:04:35.662 --> 03:04:38.404]  The bill for flowers alone was a half million dollars.
[03:04:39.715 --> 03:04:40.917]  The bar bill, $309.
[03:04:40.917 --> 03:04:42.578]  And didn't pay for any of it.
[03:04:42.578 --> 03:04:44.680]  If Trump builds the money, that's beautiful.
[03:04:44.680 --> 03:04:47.823]  She's over here sucking off the taxpayer, sucking off insider deals.
[03:04:47.823 --> 03:04:49.324]  It is an abomination.
[03:04:49.324 --> 03:04:52.107]  The Clinton's War on Women, the book, Roger Stone.
[03:04:52.107 --> 03:04:53.788]  Roger, I look forward to having you in the studio.
[03:04:53.788 --> 03:04:54.409]  Godspeed.
[03:04:54.409 --> 03:04:55.610]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:55.610 --> 03:04:56.831]  Alex, thank you.
[03:04:56.831 --> 03:05:00.054]  Once again, the best place to get the money is... Hold on one second, I'm going to come back and finish up on this side.
[03:05:00.054 --> 03:05:02.416]  Remember when we were told that he hates us for our freedoms?
[03:05:02.416 --> 03:05:05.059]  Maybe it's the politicians who hate us for our freedoms.
[03:05:05.399 --> 03:05:11.421]  When Donald Trump said, suspend all Muslim immigration until we can identify, the internet exploded.
[03:05:11.421 --> 03:05:18.324]  Obama's Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, told Muslims her greatest fear was not Muslim violence, but anti-Muslim rhetoric.
[03:05:18.324 --> 03:05:21.885]  That violent talk is not American and will be prosecuted.
[03:05:21.885 --> 03:05:24.906]  Is it religious freedom or Islam they want to protect?
[03:05:24.906 --> 03:05:28.347]  They ignored it when Trump attacked the First Amendment in the same speech.
[03:05:28.607 --> 03:05:32.409]  Maybe in certain areas, closing that internet up in some way.
[03:05:32.409 --> 03:05:35.311]  Somebody will say, oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech.
[03:05:35.311 --> 03:05:36.691]  These are foolish people.
[03:05:36.691 --> 03:05:41.013]  What is foolish is to surrender our liberty to politicians of any stripe.
[03:05:41.013 --> 03:05:49.478]  So we have politicians and the press beating the drum daily, telling you to surrender your firearms, surrender your internet, surrender your privacy.
[03:05:49.478 --> 03:05:53.260]  Let us put our hands on you at the airport, and you'll be safe.
[03:05:54.101 --> 03:05:56.246]  Slaves are never safe.
[03:05:56.246 --> 03:05:58.471]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Dunn.
[03:05:59.591 --> 03:06:00.791]  I want more candy!
[03:06:00.791 --> 03:06:02.012]  I want more video games!
[03:06:02.012 --> 03:06:02.832]  Why, why, why?
[03:06:02.832 --> 03:06:12.556]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[03:06:12.556 --> 03:06:15.257]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[03:06:15.257 --> 03:06:18.818]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[03:06:18.818 --> 03:06:25.140]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[03:06:25.140 --> 03:06:27.681]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[03:06:27.861 --> 03:06:30.281]  And then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[03:06:30.281 --> 03:06:36.662]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[03:06:36.662 --> 03:06:44.384]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[03:06:44.384 --> 03:06:51.925]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[03:06:59.587 --> 03:07:03.569]  Secret 12, Infowarslife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[03:07:03.569 --> 03:07:09.873]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[03:07:09.873 --> 03:07:17.156]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[03:07:17.156 --> 03:07:25.961]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[03:07:26.261 --> 03:07:32.424]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[03:07:32.424 --> 03:07:37.267]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[03:07:37.267 --> 03:07:40.848]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[03:07:40.848 --> 03:07:42.749]  No needles, no injections.
[03:07:42.749 --> 03:07:44.390]  Don't take my word for it.
[03:07:44.390 --> 03:07:45.591]  Try it for yourself.
[03:07:45.591 --> 03:07:47.912]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[03:08:03.226 --> 03:08:06.807]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:08:06.807 --> 03:08:11.969]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:11.969 --> 03:08:17.631]  And you can see if you're a TV viewer, the back side of the control room.
[03:08:17.631 --> 03:08:20.591]  I'm going to get a camera in the other way so folks can see all the control panels.
[03:08:20.591 --> 03:08:30.415]  Looks like the deck of a Star Destroyer with banners of George Washington and Molon Labe and Don't Tread on Me flapping in the background.
[03:08:30.415 --> 03:08:31.435]  You gotta love it!
[03:08:37.185 --> 03:08:54.863]  Alright, a few more minutes with Roger Stone, author of The Clinton's War on Women, and I'm glad I held him over because I had a question written down here I wanted to go to him on, and then I heard David Knight's little clip about Trump a few days ago, saying in certain areas of the internet we're going to have to shut it off so the terrorists can't use it.
[03:08:54.863 --> 03:08:57.405]  I think, just like other statements, he should elaborate on that.
[03:08:57.405 --> 03:09:00.589]  Is he talking about cutting off, not letting ISIS be on the internet?
[03:09:01.499 --> 03:09:09.927]  Because, obviously, my problem is, you've got Hillary and others saying, and Schmidt of Google, no, no, restrict anything hurtful sounding.
[03:09:09.927 --> 03:09:13.030]  And Facebook saying, disagreeing with someone's not allowed.
[03:09:13.030 --> 03:09:25.422]  You know, this kind of European-style censorship, where they're threatening to arrest Paul Watson for criticizing radical Islam, and it's the same censorship where they want to ban Donald Trump and arrest Donald Trump and not let Donald Trump go to Europe.
[03:09:26.022 --> 03:09:30.223]  You know, if Trump buys into this, he'll be like a snake eating himself.
[03:09:30.223 --> 03:09:31.283]  You know Trump well.
[03:09:31.283 --> 03:09:35.624]  Obviously he, months ago, was for bringing the refugees in until he knew that some were terrorists.
[03:09:35.624 --> 03:09:39.285]  Then, you know, because his heart was in it, then it flipped and went, oh, I guess we can't.
[03:09:39.285 --> 03:09:41.986]  So they demonized him on both fronts.
[03:09:41.986 --> 03:09:43.326]  What do you say to that criticism?
[03:09:43.326 --> 03:09:54.929]  Because I think it's some of the only legitimate criticism, and I don't hang my hat on that to dislike Trump, but a lot of folks don't want to be conned again, to quote The Who, and so they're looking for basically any reason
[03:09:55.829 --> 03:09:58.350]  To just think Trump is the devil incarnate?
[03:09:58.350 --> 03:10:01.171]  Yeah, I think it's a misinterpretation of what Donald means.
[03:10:01.171 --> 03:10:07.634]  Look, Trump is a big picture guy and he doesn't want the terrorists to be able to use the internet.
[03:10:07.634 --> 03:10:18.559]  He would leave it to others to determine how to block them while not infringing on the voices of freedom and people who aren't criminals and aren't trying to kill anybody using it.
[03:10:18.559 --> 03:10:20.720]  So, he loves the internet.
[03:10:21.460 --> 03:10:22.800]  Look at the way he loves Twitter.
[03:10:22.800 --> 03:10:24.741]  I mean, he's the master of Twitter.
[03:10:24.741 --> 03:10:28.302]  He's now got over, I think, 4 million followers on Twitter.
[03:10:28.302 --> 03:10:30.662]  He says it's like owning your own newspaper.
[03:10:30.662 --> 03:10:38.985]  By the way, the tweets you read are written by Donald J. Trump, not some flunky like it is, I guarantee you, in Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[03:10:38.985 --> 03:10:40.485]  Almost everybody else has others do it.
[03:10:40.485 --> 03:10:42.125]  I dictate a lot when I'm on air.
[03:10:42.125 --> 03:10:43.346]  I'll say, send this out.
[03:10:45.288 --> 03:10:51.656]  Well, no, I mean, I know for a fact, I'm not going to get into it, that you can send him a letter and a lot of times he actually reads it or sends you a letter back from him.
[03:10:51.656 --> 03:10:53.017]  He must just have incredible energy.
[03:10:54.062 --> 03:11:12.494]  Well, look, he's a very thoughtful guy, and he still likes to do business the old way, meaning that if you want to talk to Donald when I work for him, you send him a note, it would go into him, he would write his opinions or directives or whatever you needed to know, and he would send it back to you.
[03:11:12.494 --> 03:11:15.376]  At the same time, he might just call you any time.
[03:11:15.376 --> 03:11:17.258]  He's a very, very accessible guy.
[03:11:17.998 --> 03:11:24.720]  Within the Trump Organization, and I'm assuming within his campaign, I would hope the same is true.
[03:11:24.720 --> 03:11:26.501]  But he is his own strategist.
[03:11:26.501 --> 03:11:28.322]  He's his own wordsmith.
[03:11:28.322 --> 03:11:29.842]  He's his own messenger.
[03:11:29.842 --> 03:11:30.543]  He's thoughtful.
[03:11:30.543 --> 03:11:31.903]  He asks opinions.
[03:11:31.903 --> 03:11:33.384]  Sometimes he accepts your opinion.
[03:11:33.384 --> 03:11:36.185]  Sometimes he goes with someone else's opinion.
[03:11:36.185 --> 03:11:36.665]  Sometimes...
[03:11:37.205 --> 03:11:41.948]  He overrules all of his advisors, but he is very much his own man.
[03:11:41.948 --> 03:11:43.569]  Well, he's definitely a maverick.
[03:11:43.569 --> 03:11:47.331]  In closing, I'm going to hand the baton to Leanne McAdoo to see if she has one question for you.
[03:11:47.331 --> 03:11:48.772]  She hosts the 4th Hour today.
[03:11:48.772 --> 03:11:50.573]  A lot of times we drive over into it.
[03:11:50.573 --> 03:11:52.954]  It's all part of this newsroom, war room situation.
[03:11:52.954 --> 03:11:59.018]  Without getting into inside baseball that you told me last week, overall, did Trump like the interview?
[03:12:00.020 --> 03:12:01.341]  I think he was very pleased.
[03:12:01.341 --> 03:12:16.917]  First of all, he realizes, Alex, that your audience are the people who we'd be most interested, most open to his messages, to whom he has to appeal in both the upcoming Republican primaries, but also in the general election.
[03:12:16.977 --> 03:12:34.277]  So energizing the Liberty Base, recognizing that while there is no perfect candidate, Donald Trump, outsider, is so superior to Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush or the old combine, it's trying desperately to cling on to power and wealth.
[03:12:34.837 --> 03:12:37.919]  So, um, I think he was very pleased with the interview.
[03:12:37.919 --> 03:12:39.179]  I know he enjoyed it.
[03:12:39.179 --> 03:12:40.280]  It was controversial.
[03:12:40.280 --> 03:12:46.523]  Some of the liberals in the media tried to say, oh, Alex Jones, Donald Trump, they both believe, you know.
[03:12:46.523 --> 03:12:48.764]  Why don't they hold others to this?
[03:12:48.764 --> 03:12:49.064]  Sure.
[03:12:49.064 --> 03:12:59.069]  I mean, one funny tweet that I actually liked was... Man comes on your show and the libs try to intimate that he agrees with everything that you say and you agree with everything that he says.
[03:12:59.069 --> 03:13:00.289]  It's an interview.
[03:13:00.289 --> 03:13:01.710]  You have areas where you agree.
[03:13:01.710 --> 03:13:03.651]  You probably have many areas where you disagree.
[03:13:04.051 --> 03:13:05.112]  That's not the point.
[03:13:05.112 --> 03:13:10.795]  You're reaching millions of people, which is why Trump, I think, had a good time, and he thought it was a great interview.
[03:13:10.795 --> 03:13:11.515]  Well, exactly.
[03:13:11.515 --> 03:13:16.498]  I thought a lot of it comical, claiming that I said tornadoes were sent to take out Oklahoma.
[03:13:16.498 --> 03:13:19.800]  When I pulled the collar, I didn't think that happened, or I didn't believe a moon landing happened.
[03:13:19.800 --> 03:13:22.581]  I think they're confusing you with Pat Robertson.
[03:13:22.581 --> 03:13:23.742]  This is just a canard.
[03:13:23.902 --> 03:13:24.863]  Well, exactly.
[03:13:24.863 --> 03:13:28.607]  That's what I'm getting at is they always try to keep people apart.
[03:13:28.607 --> 03:13:31.730]  They're scared Trump will get the Liberty Base fully.
[03:13:31.730 --> 03:13:32.590]  They're scared.
[03:13:32.590 --> 03:13:33.071]  They know.
[03:13:33.071 --> 03:13:38.056]  I mean, they go on MSNBC almost every week and say, Republicans, don't take talking points from Alex Jones.
[03:13:38.056 --> 03:13:39.477]  Whatever you do, don't do it.
[03:13:39.477 --> 03:13:42.140]  And then they misrepresent because they're scared to death.
[03:13:42.140 --> 03:13:45.263]  They want to dictate who can talk to who, who can do what.
[03:13:45.263 --> 03:13:47.285]  And that's why I love the fact that Trump knew full well
[03:13:47.665 --> 03:13:48.745]  What was going to happen?
[03:13:48.745 --> 03:13:50.926]  He knew that they were going to blow up and freak out.
[03:13:50.926 --> 03:13:52.827]  That's what he does is poke these idiots.
[03:13:52.827 --> 03:13:54.908]  And that's what's so original about it.
[03:13:54.908 --> 03:13:55.648]  That's what I love.
[03:13:55.648 --> 03:14:00.129]  But I did love one article that was talking about the Twitter response to Trump on Alex Jones.
[03:14:00.129 --> 03:14:01.830]  And you guys might try to pull it up.
[03:14:01.830 --> 03:14:05.291]  Just Alex Jones, Twitter, Donald Trump, and Click News.
[03:14:05.291 --> 03:14:06.812]  And the headline, I think, was something like...
[03:14:07.632 --> 03:14:14.738]  Why do I think Keymaster meets Gatekeeper from Ghostbusters when Alex Jones meets Donald Trump?
[03:14:14.738 --> 03:14:19.142]  So it is pretty hilarious to think that, you know, they think of these two, you know, wild men getting together.
[03:14:19.142 --> 03:14:21.765]  But it's so much fun to not care what they think.
[03:14:21.765 --> 03:14:27.409]  And I think Trump instinctively, I saw him on TV this morning, he said, look, it's over for mainstream media and politicians.
[03:14:27.409 --> 03:14:28.230]  Don't you get it?
[03:14:28.230 --> 03:14:29.751]  The people aren't with you.
[03:14:29.751 --> 03:14:30.892]  So is that really the key here?
[03:14:31.633 --> 03:14:45.321]  Yeah, I think he understands that he has an internet-based audience and this show, obviously a great forum for him to tell so many who are getting their news from alternative sources what's really going on in America and his prescription for it.
[03:14:45.321 --> 03:14:59.188]  Otherwise, I think you're just in a situation in which the big three networks and the corporate-owned media, the six major companies that control what we see, none of them, believe me, are for anything other than the status quo.
[03:14:59.188 --> 03:15:00.389]  They'd be happy with Hillary.
[03:15:00.949 --> 03:15:06.311]  They'd be happy with Jeb because they've lined both of their pockets and they know they can buy what influence they need.
[03:15:06.311 --> 03:15:14.353]  The idea of Donald Trump being president, the old media would no longer have, first of all, unique access to information.
[03:15:14.353 --> 03:15:19.595]  More and more, the net-based media would start getting hot tips and inside information.
[03:15:20.376 --> 03:15:29.026]  So, the internet has democratized our politics with a small d. And that's why the government keeps talking about regulating it.
[03:15:29.026 --> 03:15:32.810]  When they say regulate the internet, what they mean is censor.
[03:15:32.810 --> 03:15:33.812]  You and I both know that.
[03:15:35.016 --> 03:15:45.923]  And what you're saying, knowing Trump well, and he should elaborate on this, he means censor ISIS, radical Islamists... There's got to be a way to lock them out of the system, but not everybody else who's trying to use it.
[03:15:45.923 --> 03:15:49.785]  Trump would never curtail internet freedom.
[03:15:49.785 --> 03:15:53.307]  It's too integral a part of his own political rise.
[03:15:53.307 --> 03:15:55.949]  He admits none of this would be happening if he didn't have the ability to...
[03:15:56.169 --> 03:15:58.531]  You wouldn't have a political life, as you just said, if he didn't have that.
[03:15:58.531 --> 03:16:02.053]  All right, real fast, I know you've been on for almost two hours, you're probably exhausted.
[03:16:02.053 --> 03:16:04.154]  I know, I'm energized, but a little bit tired.
[03:16:04.154 --> 03:16:08.737]  That's why Leanne comes in as the fresh horse here, you know, to dominate the fourth hour.
[03:16:08.737 --> 03:16:11.259]  Leanne, I'm going to go talk to reporters, get some work done.
[03:16:11.259 --> 03:16:12.140]  I'm going to punch out.
[03:16:12.140 --> 03:16:16.182]  You've got the last four minutes of this segment to take out to the end.
[03:16:16.182 --> 03:16:18.444]  Mr. Stone, go ahead with your questions.
[03:16:18.444 --> 03:16:19.304]  Roger, thank you so much.
[03:16:19.304 --> 03:16:20.425]  Talk to you again soon.
[03:16:20.425 --> 03:16:22.827]  She's so much better than you are, Alex.
[03:16:22.827 --> 03:16:23.988]  Yeah, I know.
[03:16:23.988 --> 03:16:25.489]  She's so much better looking than you are.
[03:16:30.951 --> 03:16:40.876]  I got to say it's very refreshing to be able to speak with someone that doesn't hold back and obviously I think a lot of people are, you know, we're seeing that's really refreshing this time around.
[03:16:40.876 --> 03:16:43.177]  So what do you think about, you know, radicalization?
[03:16:44.037 --> 03:16:45.298]  Where is this coming from?
[03:16:45.298 --> 03:16:48.341]  Because this is something we were going to be speaking about in this fourth hour.
[03:16:48.341 --> 03:16:51.704]  Is it coming from these Islamic schools?
[03:16:51.704 --> 03:16:53.225]  The mosques?
[03:16:53.225 --> 03:16:55.847]  They're saying it's just social media?
[03:16:55.847 --> 03:17:06.156]  And, you know, obviously Trump is saying that he wants to shut that down in that respect, so... Yeah, I don't think... I think there's some misinterpretation here.
[03:17:06.156 --> 03:17:11.221]  I really think that Trump is... What he means here is that we already have
[03:17:12.557 --> 03:17:16.121]  A radical and dangerous Muslim underground in the United States.
[03:17:16.121 --> 03:17:26.876]  That's what this flap about Jersey City and whether or not people whether they were dozens or hundreds or thousands of Muslims who were celebrating the attack of 9-11.
[03:17:29.138 --> 03:17:32.661]  And Trump, of course, said that and it caused a firestorm.
[03:17:32.661 --> 03:17:43.507]  Only weeks before that, he correctly said that the George W. Bush had not kept us safe and that we had terrorist threats then.
[03:17:43.507 --> 03:17:49.791]  And he really fundamentally believes that people need to know these two things.
[03:17:49.791 --> 03:17:55.715]  Well, why do you think it's more important to not offend people than to stave off terrorism?
[03:17:56.637 --> 03:17:57.217]  Exactly.
[03:17:57.217 --> 03:17:57.938]  I agree with you.
[03:17:57.938 --> 03:18:01.900]  This is a fight between safety and political correctness.
[03:18:01.900 --> 03:18:03.721]  So here's the fundamental question.
[03:18:03.721 --> 03:18:09.244]  Are we going to hurt people's feelings or are we going to save American lives?
[03:18:09.244 --> 03:18:11.446]  Trump is in favor of saving American lives.
[03:18:12.646 --> 03:18:32.697]  In our high technology and internet connected society, it's not that hard to vet 100,000 people to try to siphon out the criminals, the terrorists, the scum that they're sending here from the decent people who are really seeking refuge and the promise of America and new life.
[03:18:33.537 --> 03:18:38.458]  I have no doubt that many of these people who want to come here are peace-loving, decent people.
[03:18:38.458 --> 03:18:42.199]  But until we can sort them out from the criminals, why not put a hold?
[03:18:42.199 --> 03:18:44.279]  That's what's called common sense.
[03:18:44.279 --> 03:18:44.839]  Right.
[03:18:44.839 --> 03:18:58.722]  And the establishment was afraid that people would see the appeal of that, so they bastardized it to Trump wants to close the country to all Muslims for all time, which is not what he said.
[03:18:58.722 --> 03:19:02.883]  So it's just a typical mass media mugging is what they're attempting.
[03:19:03.991 --> 03:19:09.795]  Well, Roger Stone, I mean, this is just really exciting because, you know, we got about one minute left.
[03:19:09.795 --> 03:19:15.119]  What's the one thing you just really want women to know about Hillary Clinton?
[03:19:15.119 --> 03:19:17.681]  She's not an advocate for women and girls.
[03:19:17.681 --> 03:19:29.790]  A very close examination will show that as her husband has sexually assaulted literally dozens of women, it is Hillary who's been the desk officer working from her East Wing
[03:19:30.390 --> 03:19:31.251]  Absolutely.
[03:19:31.251 --> 03:19:38.414]  And when she was confronted about it, you know, she was confronted about it and looked like a total fool when she was put on the spot.
[03:19:38.414 --> 03:19:39.795]  Alright, Roger Stone, The Stone Zone.
[03:19:39.795 --> 03:19:40.556]  Stick around with us.
[03:19:40.556 --> 03:19:41.576]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:00.384 --> 03:20:00.968]  Good to be with you.
[03:20:02.574 --> 03:20:07.215]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[03:20:07.215 --> 03:20:11.516]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[03:20:11.516 --> 03:20:12.896]  We typically do the same thing.
[03:20:12.896 --> 03:20:15.916]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[03:20:15.916 --> 03:20:18.117]  But have you considered heat storage?
[03:20:18.117 --> 03:20:20.337]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[03:20:20.337 --> 03:20:22.617]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[03:20:22.617 --> 03:20:24.258]  How will I keep my family warm?
[03:20:24.258 --> 03:20:26.738]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[03:20:26.738 --> 03:20:30.799]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[03:20:31.644 --> 03:20:32.745]  Another concern?
[03:20:32.745 --> 03:20:36.726]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[03:20:36.726 --> 03:20:39.307]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[03:20:39.307 --> 03:20:43.289]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[03:20:43.289 --> 03:20:46.111]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[03:20:46.111 --> 03:20:50.753]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.

[03:24:10.345 --> 03:24:12.247]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:12.247 --> 03:24:17.412]  You have now entered the fourth hour overdrive and I'm your host Leanne McAdoo.
[03:24:17.412 --> 03:24:19.214]  I'm joined by David Knight.
[03:24:19.214 --> 03:24:22.878]  Now coming up after the break we're going to be speaking with Hamid Adly.
[03:24:22.878 --> 03:24:28.723]  He is a 30-year-old American citizen who happens to be a Muslim who goes to the same mosque.
[03:24:29.644 --> 03:24:33.627]  of the shooter in the San Bernardino massacre that just took place.
[03:24:33.627 --> 03:24:35.649]  We're going to be taking your phone calls.
[03:24:35.649 --> 03:24:46.557]  We want to, you know, any questions you might have for him about the mosque, about what he knows about the shooter, Islam, you know, we have a lot of questions that we want to want to ask as well.
[03:24:46.557 --> 03:24:48.819]  So we'll be giving you off a number for that.
[03:24:48.819 --> 03:24:53.602]  But David, I have you in here because I wanted to just kind of get an
[03:24:54.463 --> 03:25:00.190]  Get an update from what you know about these schools, these charter schools here in the U.S.
[03:25:00.190 --> 03:25:11.403]  that are taxpayer funded and they also happen to be sort of operated or they're Islamic school, but I mean, get into this.
[03:25:12.110 --> 03:25:12.810]  Well, there's a lawsuit.
[03:25:12.810 --> 03:25:19.153]  What brings us up again, Leanne, is that we've had a filmmaker, Mark Hall, come in and talk to us about a documentary film he did called Killing Ed.
[03:25:19.153 --> 03:25:27.156]  He was looking at charter schools, and he looked at the Fotala Gulen schools as being a worst-case problem of what can go wrong with charter schools.
[03:25:27.896 --> 03:25:33.560]  Now, Fethullah Gulen has just had a lawsuit filed against him by the Turkish government.
[03:25:33.560 --> 03:25:37.864]  There was a press conference in Washington by an international law firm based out of London.
[03:25:37.864 --> 03:25:42.627]  They're going to use this lawsuit as discovery to find out what's going on with Fethullah Gulen.
[03:25:42.627 --> 03:25:46.250]  He's currently in exile in the Poconos in Pennsylvania.
[03:25:46.990 --> 03:25:54.355]  He came to this country with letters of recommendation from people who were high up in the CIA, even though other people in the government tried to keep him out.
[03:25:54.355 --> 03:25:57.377]  He has about 10 million followers worldwide.
[03:25:57.377 --> 03:25:59.238]  He's one sect of Islam.
[03:26:02.952 --> 03:26:13.319]  He's thus made to have $25 billion worth of assets and he gets over a half a billion dollars a year of US taxpayer money to run a large network of schools.
[03:26:13.319 --> 03:26:23.445]  If you want to look at this chart that I put up here, this shows as of September 2014 the number of schools run by the Gulen movement in the United States, about 146 throughout the country, 45 of those in Texas.
[03:26:26.787 --> 03:26:27.948]  Six in Austin alone.
[03:26:27.948 --> 03:26:33.871]  We just had another one open up in November, just as I was interviewing Mark Hall for his documentary.
[03:26:33.871 --> 03:26:38.754]  Now, he's someone who's been called the world's most dangerous Islamicist.
[03:26:38.754 --> 03:26:42.156]  Now, the person who called him that is Paul L. Williams.
[03:26:42.156 --> 03:26:43.937]  He's a journalist.
[03:26:43.937 --> 03:26:48.060]  He's an author of a book called The Day of Islam, The Annihilation of America in the Western World.
[03:26:48.840 --> 03:26:52.982]  In that, he's somebody who's consulted for the FBI as well as investigated Islam.
[03:26:52.982 --> 03:26:58.724]  In that, he talks about elements of an Islamic plot that he believes.
[03:26:58.724 --> 03:27:04.447]  I don't know if it's true or not, but it's his allegation that there would be 7 to 10 nuclear bombs explode in U.S.
[03:27:04.447 --> 03:27:06.007]  cities simultaneously on a day.
[03:27:06.007 --> 03:27:07.428]  That's what the premise of that book is.
[03:27:07.588 --> 03:27:07.868]  Wow.
[03:27:07.868 --> 03:27:15.475]  Now, whether or not that is true, when somebody who has that as a premise says that even more dangerous than that is Fatala Gulen.
[03:27:15.475 --> 03:27:15.975]  Wow.
[03:27:15.975 --> 03:27:17.076]  What is dangerous about that?
[03:27:17.076 --> 03:27:27.605]  Well, think about the fact that Bill Ayers was far more dangerous when he got involved in education than when he was blowing up buildings as a terrorist for the Weathermen, the Weather Underground.
[03:27:27.725 --> 03:27:32.191]  Well, we all know there are propaganda factories, the schools, I mean... Yes.
[03:27:32.191 --> 03:27:40.882]  And in these other countries, he has 300 Gulen schools in Turkey, he's got a thousand worldwide, and 145, 146 in America.
[03:27:40.882 --> 03:27:46.128]  In the Islamic countries, they're openly operated as madrasas, Islamic madrasas.
[03:27:46.969 --> 03:27:55.401]  But in the West, and of course he has to avoid any religious connection in Western countries to get his half a billion dollars a year of taxpayer money.
[03:27:55.401 --> 03:28:04.012]  And that's the thing about charter schools, they're operated independently with very little oversight, but they get completely funded by taxpayer funding just as if it were a public school.
[03:28:04.713 --> 03:28:12.416]  In America, he doesn't operate as an Islamic Madrasa, but there is a very strong Turkification within those schools.
[03:28:12.416 --> 03:28:17.959]  So children who are coming in who are Hispanic or Asian or African-American, they're being taught Turkish.
[03:28:17.959 --> 03:28:22.861]  They're sending children, and there's 60,000 students currently being taught by these Gulen schools.
[03:28:22.861 --> 03:28:28.543]  Many of them are taking summer field trips to Turkey, where they're getting an idealized version of both Turkey and Islam.
[03:28:28.803 --> 03:28:29.043]  That's right.
[03:28:48.849 --> 03:28:53.674]  Well, and it would be just very interesting to know sort of what is in their textbooks and things.
[03:28:53.674 --> 03:29:02.884]  I know when I was taking French in college, they were teaching us French via teaching us about Islam in France.
[03:29:02.884 --> 03:29:07.889]  And so all of the lessons were about Islam and the headdresses and, you know,
[03:29:08.129 --> 03:29:09.110]  The Germans, same thing.
[03:29:09.110 --> 03:29:10.951]  They teach you about the culture, the immersion.
[03:29:10.951 --> 03:29:13.613]  And so, of course, it is a very, very strong Turkification.
[03:29:13.613 --> 03:29:17.815]  And you have to ask yourself, why are American taxpayers paying for this?
[03:29:17.815 --> 03:29:19.577]  What is the hidden agenda with this?
[03:29:19.577 --> 03:29:23.119]  Well, of course, it is selling us an agenda of Islam.
[03:29:23.119 --> 03:29:25.020]  That's what we have to be concerned about.
[03:29:25.020 --> 03:29:33.386]  If you want to live under a global theocracy, because that's the fundamental tenet of Islam, that it should be a global governance and it should be theocratic.
[03:29:33.946 --> 03:29:36.908]  We don't want to live in a theocratic... I don't want to live in a theocratic country.
[03:29:36.908 --> 03:29:38.849]  It's anathema to what this country is based on.
[03:29:38.849 --> 03:29:39.609]  Yeah.
[03:29:39.609 --> 03:29:47.273]  And we've also got reports now of other Islamic schools being shut down because some teenagers that attended tried to go join ISIS.
[03:29:47.273 --> 03:29:49.174]  So, there you go.
[03:29:49.174 --> 03:29:50.575]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.575 --> 03:29:52.176]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.176 --> 03:29:55.798]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.856 --> 03:30:11.003]  Climate alarmists openly talk about condemning you into an energy poverty, where you won't be able to afford a home bigger than 200 square feet, let alone a car, heating or air conditioning.
[03:30:11.003 --> 03:30:16.286]  But there's another form of sustainable austerity that has been part of the global governance plan.
[03:30:16.286 --> 03:30:19.528]  They've kept it quiet, but now they're talking about it openly.
[03:30:19.528 --> 03:30:21.610]  Your food is on the austerity menu.
[03:30:22.170 --> 03:30:31.733]  We're being told now that livestock, beef, pork, chicken, etc., create as much greenhouse gas as all the cars, planes, ships, and other transportation combined.
[03:30:31.733 --> 03:30:32.573]  But don't worry.
[03:30:32.573 --> 03:30:37.014]  The carbon billionaires already have a solution for their fantasy problem.
[03:30:37.014 --> 03:30:41.976]  Bill Gates and Google Ventures have created the, quote, impossible burger, unquote.
[03:30:41.976 --> 03:30:44.397]  You know, meat is evil, but you don't have to be evil.
[03:30:44.397 --> 03:30:46.877]  You can buy their soylent green substitute.
[03:30:46.877 --> 03:30:48.998]  Next thing they'll be breeding is like cattle.
[03:30:49.258 --> 03:30:56.227]  Isn't it nice of the crony climatists that they don't take away our food until they've produced something else they can force us to buy?
[03:30:56.227 --> 03:30:57.689]  They're so thoughtful that way.
[03:30:57.689 --> 03:30:59.772]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:30:59.772 --> 03:31:03.296]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:31:03.296 --> 03:31:07.702]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth,
[03:31:07.722 --> 03:31:08.923]  We're good to go.
[03:31:29.617 --> 03:31:30.718]  BrainForce is here.
[03:31:30.718 --> 03:31:32.939]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.

[03:31:37.922 --> 03:31:41.204]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:31:41.204 --> 03:31:44.706]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:31:44.706 --> 03:31:46.387]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:31:46.667 --> 03:31:47.587]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[03:31:47.587 --> 03:31:48.788]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:31:48.788 --> 03:31:50.768]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[03:34:32.424 --> 03:34:35.765]  So Rob Dew joining me now in studio.
[03:34:35.765 --> 03:34:37.726]  Thank you very much.
[03:34:37.726 --> 03:34:41.948]  So basically our guest today is going to be taking some calls.
[03:34:41.948 --> 03:34:47.690]  I'm kind of interested just based on the responses that we got in the comments on YouTube.
[03:34:47.690 --> 03:34:51.992]  So obviously it's a lot of people are going to have some things to say to this gentleman.
[03:34:53.012 --> 03:34:59.176]  A lot of people think that they can't believe anything people say anyway because Muslims are allowed to lie to non-believers.
[03:34:59.176 --> 03:35:00.157]  So, what do you think?
[03:35:00.157 --> 03:35:02.679]  I feel like I'm a little hot under the collar in here.
[03:35:02.679 --> 03:35:11.204]  It should be interesting, but on the heels of Trump's comments of saying, hey, until we get a program in place, we should keep people out.
[03:35:11.204 --> 03:35:19.430]  Because we're not able to vet people and that's been admitted by all these so-called agencies and public servants that we pay a lot of money to and can't seem to do anything, really.
[03:35:19.990 --> 03:35:21.312]  But here's an article.
[03:35:21.312 --> 03:35:25.557]  Norway paying asylum seekers to return home as refugee crisis continues.
[03:35:25.557 --> 03:35:34.087]  They're looking at paying upwards of 80,000 kroner which is 6,200 pounds in addition to having their flights paid for.
[03:35:34.087 --> 03:35:37.931]  That's a couple of two children can receive that and so they are trying to...
[03:35:38.752 --> 03:35:45.936]  Export people so we're gonna give you $6,000 to go wherever you want right and pay for your flights Wow Where do you want to go?
[03:35:45.936 --> 03:35:51.259]  Yeah, United States like how does some of the cities do with the homeless population here, right?
[03:35:51.259 --> 03:36:01.544]  And then here's here's an article I saw this morning out of the Express and it says world-changing earthquake to hit us in two days claims seismic psychic and the guy's name is mr. Hooger beats and
[03:36:02.125 --> 03:36:08.833]  He's predicted, he actually has predicted an earthquake, but what's crazy is this one he's predicting for the coast of Oregon.
[03:36:08.833 --> 03:36:16.222]  It hits somewhere in southern Oregon, so all the way up to Vancouver, down to central California will be affected by this.
[03:36:17.523 --> 03:36:21.247]  After I read that, I'm like, wow, that's long overdue for a seismic psychic.
[03:36:21.247 --> 03:36:33.662]  Actually, back in July, here's an article out of KON6, Oregon will be toast when the next big earthquake hits, and the northwest region is 72 years overdue for the next big earthquake.
[03:36:33.662 --> 03:36:38.066]  So they're even predicting, scientists are predicting that it could happen, and they're saying
[03:36:39.691 --> 03:36:41.852]  50 foot high tsunamis going over the cliffs.
[03:36:41.852 --> 03:36:44.193]  If you look at the Oregon coast, it's got a lot of cliffs.
[03:36:44.193 --> 03:36:45.394]  They're saying it's going to roll over that.
[03:36:45.394 --> 03:36:47.615]  13,000 people are going to die immediately.
[03:36:47.615 --> 03:36:48.175]  Wow.
[03:36:48.175 --> 03:36:49.135]  By that giant tsunami.
[03:36:49.135 --> 03:36:51.497]  And just not being prepared for something like that.
[03:36:51.497 --> 03:36:52.977]  Well, and that's one thing.
[03:36:52.977 --> 03:36:59.800]  Afterwards, you know, that's where you have a lot of people die in these things of drinking dirty water, not having food, not having power.
[03:36:59.800 --> 03:37:06.703]  And, you know, it just reminded me, we're selling this new, you know, power station that less than 100 of them that we have left in stock.
[03:37:06.703 --> 03:37:07.884]  The premium power pack.
[03:37:08.044 --> 03:37:08.644]  Exactly.
[03:37:08.644 --> 03:37:09.565]  So we got that.
[03:37:09.565 --> 03:37:15.268]  You can get your water filters here that don't need electricity or we even have storable food.
[03:37:15.268 --> 03:37:19.271]  So, you know, around my house, I collect rainwater and I don't collect it to water my plants.
[03:37:19.271 --> 03:37:20.431]  I let my plants die.
[03:37:20.431 --> 03:37:26.335]  I collect it so if something happens, I've got water on site that I can filter and then drink.
[03:37:26.335 --> 03:37:26.695]  Yeah.
[03:37:26.695 --> 03:37:29.737]  And then or make food with it, you know, because I have storable food as well.
[03:37:29.737 --> 03:37:32.098]  It's still legal to collect rainwater here.
[03:37:32.358 --> 03:37:33.659]  Yeah, still.
[03:37:33.659 --> 03:37:42.622]  They make it illegal to water your lawn, so pretty soon they'll make it illegal to collect the rainwater, because they want it to all flow downstream and flood the houses downstream from Austin, Texas.
[03:37:42.622 --> 03:37:45.624]  But I thought that was pretty interesting.
[03:37:45.624 --> 03:37:48.905]  So they're predicting December 11th or 12th, so that's tomorrow or Saturday.
[03:37:48.905 --> 03:37:50.446]  Wow, I don't think it's wise to make those sort of...
[03:37:54.298 --> 03:38:00.580]  Specific day this is going to happen because then if it doesn't then you're just debunked and everything you say is debunked and hopefully it doesn't happen.
[03:38:00.580 --> 03:38:04.621]  Hopefully seismic psychic is wrong.
[03:38:04.621 --> 03:38:08.302]  Well guys do we have our guest on the line?
[03:38:08.302 --> 03:38:11.483]  Alright so let's go ahead and bring in Hamid Adly.
[03:38:11.483 --> 03:38:17.584]  Now Hamid we interviewed you the other night and thank you so much for coming on the show.
[03:38:17.584 --> 03:38:19.125]  You attend the same mosque.
[03:38:19.665 --> 03:38:19.805]  I think?
[03:38:36.804 --> 03:38:44.795]  Said and his wife were actually radicalized up to, you know, two years ago and that they had been planning other things.
[03:38:44.795 --> 03:38:46.979]  And so did you get any kind of indication?
[03:38:46.979 --> 03:38:51.825]  I mean, were there any signs of this sort of radicalization?
[03:38:52.520 --> 03:38:53.981]  And how would you know?
[03:38:53.981 --> 03:38:55.121]  Never, not at this mosque.
[03:38:55.121 --> 03:38:58.462]  And I'm sorry, just to correct you, I've been going there since third grade.
[03:38:58.462 --> 03:38:59.483]  Third grade, okay.
[03:38:59.483 --> 03:39:01.244]  I knew there was a three in there.
[03:39:01.244 --> 03:39:04.245]  Yeah, yeah, so pretty much I've been going there all my life.
[03:39:04.245 --> 03:39:11.728]  And, you know, again, you know, this is a place where I go for spirituality, to find God, to find peace.
[03:39:11.728 --> 03:39:16.130]  Never did I ever see any radicalization or any craziness like this.
[03:39:16.130 --> 03:39:21.512]  You know, mosques are open to everybody, Muslims and non-Muslims, and we have a lot of people come and go over the years.
[03:39:22.498 --> 03:39:27.462]  And he happened to be one of them, and he went there during the Friday prayers.
[03:39:27.462 --> 03:39:34.667]  You know, as you know, Friday is our holy day, and that's the day we pray, like Sunday is for Christians.
[03:39:34.667 --> 03:39:46.375]  So he would attend Fridays, and he would come in, and I'm sorry, you said something about, did I see any evidence of radicalization along the lines on his part of the suspect?
[03:39:46.375 --> 03:39:49.017]  Yeah, I mean, I guess, you know, a lot of people say
[03:39:50.541 --> 03:39:56.464]  Islam is a religion of peace, but then you have other people going, oh, read the Quran itself and the passages there.
[03:39:56.464 --> 03:40:09.589]  So, how do you know when someone is taking it across the line to where they're now taking these passages out of abstraction and into, like, well, this is actually what we need to do.
[03:40:09.589 --> 03:40:12.711]  And it shouldn't be left in the medieval
[03:40:13.741 --> 03:40:18.924]  Well, you're always going to have a small minority of angry people, I think, anywhere you go.
[03:40:18.924 --> 03:40:29.970]  A lot of those verses that pertain to those type of subjects were revealed at a time of war, battle, thousands of years ago.
[03:40:29.970 --> 03:40:32.531]  But we are at a time of war and battle.
[03:40:32.531 --> 03:40:35.013]  I mean, people argue that this is now.
[03:40:38.288 --> 03:40:41.892]  Well, I would say we're not really at war per se.
[03:40:41.892 --> 03:40:55.927]  I'd say these are like different, you know, a lot of isolated cases, a lot of nutcase mental illness type people that are taking these verses out of context and going out, you know, and massacring innocent people, you know, because this is anti-Islamic.
[03:40:56.508 --> 03:41:07.222]  You know, there's verses in the Quran that clearly say this, you know, just to quote one, chapter 5, verse 32, that if you kill one person, it's as if you kill mankind, all of mankind.
[03:41:07.222 --> 03:41:09.965]  So that's just to give you an example of some of the positive aspects.
[03:41:09.965 --> 03:41:11.788]  I think a lot of people focus on the negative.
[03:41:12.508 --> 03:41:20.052]  And what I'm trying to do here is, you know, say, hey, you know, if you focus on the negative parts, obviously you're going to have a negative attitude towards Islam.
[03:41:20.052 --> 03:41:27.475]  You know, try to look at the positive, try to look at the positive verses, because many religions have these type of verses in them that pertain to war.
[03:41:27.475 --> 03:41:30.836]  You know, I don't want to name other religions, obviously.
[03:41:30.836 --> 03:41:33.898]  My message is complete positive and love towards everyone.
[03:41:33.898 --> 03:41:38.280]  But I would say, you know, many, many different religious books have
[03:41:39.079 --> 03:41:40.700]  Well, it's the Old Testament of the Bible.
[03:41:40.700 --> 03:41:43.001]  It's littered with, you know, eye for an eye.
[03:41:43.001 --> 03:41:43.801]  Right.
[03:41:43.801 --> 03:41:45.502]  A lot of, you know, people killing each other.
[03:41:45.502 --> 03:41:46.002]  Right.
[03:41:46.002 --> 03:41:51.585]  The difference is people stopped, for the most part, they stopped killing people about 500 years ago, so.
[03:41:52.830 --> 03:41:56.012]  Well, people haven't stopped killing people.
[03:41:56.012 --> 03:42:04.558]  And it's easy to, I think, couch something and, well, you know, they try to say it's a hate crime if a white person kills a black person.
[03:42:04.558 --> 03:42:05.359]  And you know what?
[03:42:05.359 --> 03:42:07.500]  If you kill anybody, it's a hate crime.
[03:42:07.500 --> 03:42:08.281]  Right.
[03:42:08.281 --> 03:42:09.281]  Period.
[03:42:09.281 --> 03:42:12.023]  And I'm against all, yeah, we're against all shootings.
[03:42:12.023 --> 03:42:14.425]  I mean, I'm against all of these massacres.
[03:42:14.425 --> 03:42:21.110]  There's a way to stop these, to prevent all of these shootings, not just the Muslims, but the non-Muslim ones, like the guy who shot up the Planned Parenthood.
[03:42:21.610 --> 03:42:37.116]  I mean, if he's a gun owner, and I know a lot of your audiences are, you know, great, standing up for the right to bear arms, and I would say, what if you, you know, you don't like to be clumped, a gun owner doesn't like to be clumped in the same category as a person like that.
[03:42:37.116 --> 03:42:39.337]  You can't clump them all in the same category.
[03:42:39.337 --> 03:42:46.640]  So I would say, you know, if you see this guy for real, you can't clump all Muslims and say, we're all at war, we're all going to go fight, because that's not the case.
[03:42:46.640 --> 03:42:49.481]  Just like all gun owners are not going to go and massacre innocent people.
[03:42:49.481 --> 03:42:50.101]  It's just not true.
[03:42:50.961 --> 03:43:01.408]  What do you think about Donald Trump's comments on saying that he would like to have a plan where we don't bring in anybody from, I guess that's a Muslim, unless they, until they have a properly vetting system.
[03:43:01.408 --> 03:43:02.008]  Properly vetted.
[03:43:02.008 --> 03:43:03.569]  A proper vetting system.
[03:43:03.569 --> 03:43:04.890]  If they're coming from these places.
[03:43:04.890 --> 03:43:06.991]  Right, how do you feel about that?
[03:43:06.991 --> 03:43:15.716]  Well, you know, I think that's, you know, the way he said it, I think, is un-American, in my opinion.
[03:43:17.308 --> 03:43:29.374]  I think he needs to re-evaluate how he says things, because the way he comes off, you know, he's always, like, targeting certain people, and every day I turn around, it's like some other group he's talking about.
[03:43:29.374 --> 03:43:40.559]  But, obviously, every country has a vetting system, so if there's going to be a system that vets potential terrorists or potential radicals,
[03:43:40.979 --> 03:43:45.723]  Then yeah, you should vet those, because even Muslim countries have systems like this.
[03:43:45.723 --> 03:43:47.964]  So, I mean, I'm all for it.
[03:43:47.964 --> 03:43:53.349]  I mean, just in general, to vet cuckoo and crazy people in general.
[03:43:53.349 --> 03:43:56.171]  There's a vetting system to prevent these kinds of shootings in general.
[03:43:56.391 --> 03:43:57.331]  I mean, I'm all for it.
[03:43:57.331 --> 03:44:01.273]  But yeah, I mean, even Muslim countries have systems like this where they vet these type of radicals.
[03:44:01.273 --> 03:44:07.036]  Radical extremism is anti-Islamic, and we have to speak up against them.
[03:44:07.036 --> 03:44:10.238]  These are not Muslims, and they're making all of us look bad.
[03:44:10.238 --> 03:44:14.280]  And actually, we're becoming the victims of these radicals and these extremists.
[03:44:14.700 --> 03:44:16.061]  What were you thinking in your inner circle?
[03:44:37.523 --> 03:44:38.744]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:44:38.744 --> 03:44:43.707]  These are radicals that are just on the other side of the spectrum, like I was saying the other day.
[03:44:43.707 --> 03:44:57.194]  These are people that are a certain minority of radicals, and I don't even want to call them Muslim because some of them are so extreme and so un-Islamic that I don't even know if they're Muslim.
[03:44:57.194 --> 03:45:03.378]  I don't even know if they're just pretending to be, like that guy who came on the video that he was talking about Trump.
[03:45:04.253 --> 03:45:20.320]  I mean, I don't know if these are people that are just trying to become famous or they're just really angry and they're, you know, just using it as a way to vent and just, you know, again, you know, just a mental illness and just craziness.
[03:45:20.320 --> 03:45:22.101]  But yeah, these are people that are in the minority.
[03:45:22.101 --> 03:45:25.963]  These are radicals and extremists that we are against and it's completely un-Islamic.
[03:45:26.987 --> 03:45:29.789]  Yeah, I think the internet has kind of created this whole thing.
[03:45:29.789 --> 03:45:31.991]  It's a breeding ground for mental illness.
[03:45:31.991 --> 03:45:37.836]  People with no moral compass get these ideas and they're able to be programmed in an instance.
[03:45:37.836 --> 03:45:42.119]  And they can be completely anonymous to have their crazy ideas put out there.
[03:45:42.119 --> 03:45:45.502]  Well, let's go ahead and take a call from Catherine in Texas.
[03:45:45.502 --> 03:45:49.385]  She wants to talk about Islamic doctrine.
[03:45:49.385 --> 03:45:50.726]  Hi, thank you for taking my call.
[03:45:50.726 --> 03:45:51.326]  Can you hear me?
[03:45:51.326 --> 03:45:54.128]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:45:54.128 --> 03:45:56.230]  I have a comment and a question for the guest.
[03:45:58.016 --> 03:46:14.710]  I, as an American, have been reading a lot and studying a lot about Muslims, because when we have a group of people who are wanting to do things against our Constitution, we, all of us, should learn their rules and their books.
[03:46:14.710 --> 03:46:17.092]  And here's the issue that I have.
[03:46:17.092 --> 03:46:25.759]  When Muslims are a minority, they are taught that they have to be pretending to be friends with the Jewish and the Christian people, which the Quran says
[03:46:26.229 --> 03:46:28.289]  They should not befriend.
[03:46:28.289 --> 03:46:31.690]  And so, this is a moral value, okay?
[03:46:31.690 --> 03:46:45.073]  When a person is taught that they can lie to you about whatever it takes, so long as it's, you know, intensifying or increasing Islam wherever they go, to me, they're not trustworthy anywhere they go.
[03:46:45.073 --> 03:46:49.214]  So, I have an issue with the Muslims because
[03:46:49.801 --> 03:47:00.023]  If you guys are taught that you can lie to us, Americans, in order to advance Islam when you're a minority in the country, then we need to be aware of that.
[03:47:00.023 --> 03:47:08.745]  And here's the thing, the gentleman who you have as a guest, if he doesn't denounce those things in Sharia, then he's part of the problem.
[03:47:08.745 --> 03:47:14.066]  And people in the Internet and in the news are correct in saying that it is not
[03:47:14.741 --> 03:47:17.202]  This aggravated Islam that we're dealing with.
[03:47:17.202 --> 03:47:19.083]  This is the stuff that they all learn.
[03:47:19.083 --> 03:47:20.343]  It's in their book.
[03:47:20.343 --> 03:47:21.724]  It's their doctrine.
[03:47:21.724 --> 03:47:32.287]  So I want to ask them, how are we supposed to trust any of you when you have a doctrine that teaches you to lie to the people so long as you're advancing Islam?
[03:47:32.287 --> 03:47:32.747]  Right, right.
[03:47:32.747 --> 03:47:34.608]  And I absolutely understand what you're saying.
[03:47:34.608 --> 03:47:36.489]  Thank you, Catherine.
[03:47:36.489 --> 03:47:37.129]  Yeah.
[03:47:37.129 --> 03:47:42.031]  So again, you know, this is, this is, again, you know, I have to stress that
[03:47:42.932 --> 03:47:48.156]  The doctrine, the sharia, all of these things are open to interpretation.
[03:47:48.156 --> 03:47:50.037]  So you have different types of Muslims.
[03:47:50.037 --> 03:48:00.826]  So you might have an extremist that is ascribing to a specific doctrine that was revealed at a certain time, thousands of years ago.
[03:48:00.826 --> 03:48:04.749]  Like if you look at here, hundreds of years ago.
[03:48:05.695 --> 03:48:07.415]  The Jim Crow laws, right?
[03:48:07.415 --> 03:48:11.016]  That was laws that were enacted at a certain time, which are now illegal.
[03:48:11.016 --> 03:48:23.739]  So, when you're looking at religion and some of the Sharia interpretations and doctrine, these are things that were revealed thousands of years ago that these extremists are taking out of context now.
[03:48:23.739 --> 03:48:30.180]  And when you're reading this, I completely understand, but you see, a lot of different religions have these type of things in them.
[03:48:30.700 --> 03:48:55.188]  Well, but do you see how ISIS or these other groups are trying to push this narrative that they have the grasp on the true Islam and so then you see the young people who are really wanting to gravitate toward this religion and, you know, be as devout as they possibly can, they're going this way and it's social media or whatever, they're telling them that this extreme version of Islam is what
[03:48:56.088 --> 03:48:56.469]  It's true.
[03:49:08.334 --> 03:49:10.215]  Dominating the conversation, basically.
[03:49:10.215 --> 03:49:10.635]  Right, right.
[03:49:10.635 --> 03:49:10.935]  You're right.
[03:49:10.935 --> 03:49:20.821]  And this is an issue within the community, Muslim community, and organizations like CARE and others are actually standing up now and having meetings to address this and have more moderates speak out against them.
[03:49:20.821 --> 03:49:28.605]  Because we have to speak out against them in order to prevent these youth from being brainwashed by these psychopaths, these extremists, these fanatics.
[03:49:29.125 --> 03:49:33.789]  And to your caller, I would say, you know, go out and make friends with Muslims.
[03:49:33.789 --> 03:49:35.431]  Go out and to the mosque.
[03:49:35.431 --> 03:49:36.692]  It's open to everybody.
[03:49:36.692 --> 03:49:39.394]  You know, come to us and we can have a dialogue.
[03:49:39.394 --> 03:49:41.856]  You know, I was never taught to lie to non-Muslims.
[03:49:41.856 --> 03:49:46.300]  And that thing, that taqiyyah, you know, that was revealed in 765 A.D.
[03:49:46.300 --> 03:49:51.104]  So you're talking about a thousand, two thousand years ago.
[03:49:51.104 --> 03:49:53.887]  So that was in a time when one sect was
[03:49:55.805 --> 03:49:57.867]  Had some conflict with another sect.
[03:49:57.867 --> 03:50:00.909]  It was actually a conflict within Muslims.
[03:50:00.909 --> 03:50:06.433]  And that they're taking that out of context now and ISIS and these other crazy organizations and telling people to lie.
[03:50:06.433 --> 03:50:07.333]  But I was never taught that.
[03:50:07.333 --> 03:50:10.736]  I mean, I have a lot of Christian, non-Muslim friends.
[03:50:10.736 --> 03:50:12.017]  I mean, I grew up here.
[03:50:12.017 --> 03:50:16.660]  And, you know, I've never lied to them to further any cause.
[03:50:16.660 --> 03:50:17.941]  I'm just a regular person.
[03:50:17.941 --> 03:50:21.964]  So you got to differentiate between these.
[03:50:21.964 --> 03:50:24.546]  But I can understand where she's coming from because she's going online.
[03:50:24.986 --> 03:50:31.028]  So you mean that you are not part of this diabolical plan to have Islam rule the world?
[03:50:31.028 --> 03:50:32.629]  No, of course not.
[03:50:32.629 --> 03:50:33.789]  It doesn't sound like it at all.
[03:50:33.789 --> 03:50:36.490]  Mr. Aldi, I have a question real quick as we're going to break.
[03:50:36.490 --> 03:50:38.231]  What would you say to Muslims who are coming here?
[03:50:38.231 --> 03:50:46.294]  Do you think they should assimilate to American values, which it seems you've done, and you know, you seem successful, you were born here, but what would you say to Muslims who are coming here?
[03:50:46.294 --> 03:50:47.714]  Should they... Absolutely.
[03:50:47.714 --> 03:50:48.195]  Absolutely.
[03:50:48.195 --> 03:50:53.016]  Yeah, well, I want you to answer that question right after... We'll try to get you some more calls.
[03:50:53.016 --> 03:50:54.017]  Yeah, right after the break.
[03:51:00.908 --> 03:51:09.614]  My name is Don Whiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:09.614 --> 03:51:11.095]  What did I do?
[03:51:11.095 --> 03:51:19.021]  I created ExtendoVite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.
[03:51:19.021 --> 03:51:27.447]  For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available to you, so you don't have to suffer the same thing I did.
[03:51:27.987 --> 03:51:33.150]  Clean your blocked arteries and strengthen your heart and boost your natural immune system.
[03:51:33.150 --> 03:51:36.812]  I'm 60 years old now and I still work every day.
[03:51:36.812 --> 03:51:38.673]  To get your Xtendivite, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:38.673 --> 03:51:39.714]  That's 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.
[03:51:39.714 --> 03:51:42.736]  Xtendivite is only $69.95 for a 2-month supply of either capsules or liquid.
[03:51:59.867 --> 03:52:09.613]  My fellow patriots, one of the things I'm most proud of is the fact that the Infowars operation reaches more than 20 million people a week, worldwide, with the message of liberty.
[03:52:09.813 --> 03:52:10.394]  We're good to go.
[03:52:26.776 --> 03:52:45.189]  Until December 18th, 2015, we are extending free shipping on top of huge discounts on cutting-edge nutraceuticals, high-quality non-GMO heirloom seeds, top-of-the-line water filtration systems that remove glyphosates, fluoride, more, and the list of specials goes on and on.
[03:52:45.189 --> 03:52:55.556]  Some discounts are as high as 50% at InfoWarsStore.com on top of free shipping through December 18th at InfoWarsStore and InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:52:56.037 --> 03:52:59.173]  And remember, InfoWars is the operation that you built.
[03:53:02.185 --> 03:53:06.809]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[03:53:06.809 --> 03:53:11.092]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[03:53:11.092 --> 03:53:12.474]  We typically do the same thing.
[03:53:12.474 --> 03:53:15.516]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[03:53:15.516 --> 03:53:17.718]  But have you considered heat storage?
[03:53:17.718 --> 03:53:19.940]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[03:53:19.940 --> 03:53:22.222]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[03:53:22.222 --> 03:53:23.863]  How will I keep my family warm?
[03:53:23.863 --> 03:53:26.345]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[03:53:26.345 --> 03:53:30.408]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[03:53:31.229 --> 03:53:32.330]  Another concern?
[03:53:32.330 --> 03:53:36.313]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[03:53:36.313 --> 03:53:38.914]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[03:53:38.914 --> 03:53:42.877]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[03:53:42.877 --> 03:53:45.679]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[03:53:45.679 --> 03:53:50.342]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[03:53:50.342 --> 03:53:52.344]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[03:53:52.344 --> 03:53:53.985]  FortressClothing.com.
[03:53:53.985 --> 03:53:55.346]  You'll never be cold again.
[03:54:07.264 --> 03:54:08.128]  Yeah.
[03:54:15.971 --> 03:54:19.473]  Alright, we are in the final segment here of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:19.473 --> 03:54:20.914]  This is the Overdrive Hour.
[03:54:20.914 --> 03:54:24.056]  I'm Leanne McAdoo, joined in studio by Rob Dew.
[03:54:24.056 --> 03:54:28.958]  Now we are going to go take one more call for our guest, Hamid Adly.
[03:54:28.958 --> 03:54:31.400]  I wanted to go ahead and give out your website you just started, Hamid.
[03:54:31.400 --> 03:54:34.061]  It's MuslimPeacePledge.com.
[03:54:34.061 --> 03:54:36.322]  You can also ask Hamid any questions.
[03:54:36.322 --> 03:54:37.283]  He's on Twitter at
[03:54:37.603 --> 03:54:39.144]  Muslim Pledge.
[03:54:39.144 --> 03:54:45.187]  Now let's go ahead and take a call from Jeremy in Kansas.
[03:54:45.187 --> 03:54:47.368]  Go ahead.
[03:54:47.368 --> 03:54:50.109]  Thank you so much for having this important conversation.
[03:54:50.109 --> 03:55:03.816]  I wanted to bring up the issue of state-sponsored false flag terrorism, treasonous in nature that uses Islamic people as patsies.
[03:55:04.266 --> 03:55:16.395]  And that's not to say that there aren't, there isn't a, uh, top theory of, you know, Wahhabist death cult that people mainly in the Arab-Muslim world need to bring out, because they do.
[03:55:16.395 --> 03:55:18.617]  But let's deal with San Bernardino.
[03:55:18.617 --> 03:55:23.661]  It just, uh, a third eyewitness has just come on the record.
[03:55:23.661 --> 03:55:25.102]  He saw a driver.
[03:55:25.102 --> 03:55:27.544]  Yeah, he said the driver was a regular white dude, right?
[03:55:27.544 --> 03:55:28.364]  Is that what you were going to say?
[03:55:28.364 --> 03:55:29.265]  Sorry to steal your thunder.
[03:55:30.438 --> 03:55:35.999]  Yeah, he's the third eyewitness who said that there was three shooters.
[03:55:35.999 --> 03:55:39.860]  They were large, athletic, and apparently Caucasian.
[03:55:39.860 --> 03:55:45.881]  And he, this is an additional thing, he said that he was actually called by an unknown person on 7 p.m.
[03:55:45.881 --> 03:55:52.342]  of the evening of the shooting, who told him to say that he should say it was Saeed Farooq who was the shooter.
[03:55:52.342 --> 03:55:56.623]  And the other piece that has just come out is a SWAT team medic
[03:55:57.287 --> 03:56:00.430]  He said that they were running the SWAT drill at the very same time.
[03:56:00.430 --> 03:56:03.833]  He said they only have them once or twice a year.
[03:56:03.833 --> 03:56:06.956]  And so they were ready to roll and he never saw the shooters.
[03:56:06.956 --> 03:56:12.100]  All he did was he immediately courageously took care to triage all the people.
[03:56:12.100 --> 03:56:22.810]  So this fits into this larger problem of September 11th where we see drills, you know, almost 40-something drills that were memetic of the actual attack that happened.
[03:56:23.246 --> 03:56:33.754]  And meanwhile, the Arab Muslim men who were blamed for September 11th were protected by CIA, framed by Israeli intelligence, living with FBI informants, taught how to fly.
[03:56:33.754 --> 03:56:35.015]  Thank you, Jeremy.
[03:56:35.015 --> 03:56:42.280]  We see a lot of those same patterns again happening here with this, as well as that mysterious deposit into the bank account and things like that.
[03:56:43.061 --> 03:56:45.803]  So yeah, I mean, that's definitely something that goes on.
[03:56:45.803 --> 03:56:54.932]  Not to say that these two were not involved, but yes, definitely some eyewitness accounts that are countering the official story.
[03:56:54.932 --> 03:56:58.475]  And just like after 9-11, they sort of dropped the ball and weren't ever allowed to
[03:56:59.095 --> 03:57:06.442]  I think the FBI just opening up that house so early as it did for reporters to just walk around and look at people's driver's license and personal information.
[03:57:06.442 --> 03:57:09.465]  Are you absolutely sure that there were no traps set?
[03:57:09.465 --> 03:57:15.530]  Because they said that they had set some traps to go off once the police entered the home, but they didn't work.
[03:57:15.530 --> 03:57:17.251]  You know, so I mean, that's just dangerous.
[03:57:17.251 --> 03:57:19.734]  So yeah, that was my... Let's give Mr. Adly the final comment on this.
[03:57:21.513 --> 03:57:22.073]  Yes.
[03:57:22.073 --> 03:57:22.814]  I'm sorry, what was the question?
[03:57:37.267 --> 03:57:47.212]  Yeah, I mean, you know, if that's the case, then obviously it breaks my heart because then, you know, innocent people are being victimized on both sides of the spectrum.
[03:57:47.212 --> 03:57:51.254]  Not only the people that are getting killed, but also the people that have to suffer the backlash.
[03:57:51.254 --> 03:57:58.117]  And that's one of the reasons why I'm putting myself out there is because, look, I mean, if you're mad, you know, get mad at me.
[03:57:58.117 --> 03:58:04.740]  Don't get mad at the innocent women and children that you see on the street that are wearing the headscarf or that are dressed in traditional clothes because they're just regular people.
[03:58:05.461 --> 03:58:12.414]  And, you know, if these events are what you say they are, then it just further saddens me and breaks my heart.
[03:58:12.864 --> 03:58:13.985]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:58:13.985 --> 03:58:17.950]  Well, you know, I think we're going to stay on this story as well.
[03:58:17.950 --> 03:58:19.932]  It's definitely gotten a lot of traction in the news.
[03:58:19.932 --> 03:58:20.853]  Reach out to Mr. Adly.
[03:58:20.853 --> 03:58:21.453]  Reach out to him.
[03:58:21.453 --> 03:58:22.775]  People out there, talk to him.
[03:58:22.775 --> 03:58:27.340]  He started a specific Twitter and a webpage for you to ask him your questions.
[03:58:27.340 --> 03:58:31.324]  Give it to him and I think you're ready to open up and have an honest dialogue there.
[03:58:31.324 --> 03:58:33.667]  Hamid Adly at Muslim Pledge.
[03:58:33.667 --> 03:58:36.870]  Tune in tonight to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:58:36.870 --> 03:58:38.392]  David Knight will be your host.
