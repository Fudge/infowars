[00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.130]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.911]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.911 --> 00:00:09.671]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.671 --> 00:00:11.252]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.252 --> 00:00:12.792]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:16.973]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.973 --> 00:00:21.934]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:27.896]  The infographic on the front page of InfoWars.com says it all.
[00:00:27.896 --> 00:00:32.537]  It's an image of the mountains of El Paso, Texas, on the Mexican border.
[00:00:34.157 --> 00:00:39.319]  And the headline reads, ISIS is operating a camp just a few miles from El Paso, Texas.
[00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:40.979]  Judicial watch.
[00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:44.760]  Joe Biggs and Josh Owens filed a report last night.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.541]  They're on the ground in El Paso.
[00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:50.462]  They've already been into the edge of Mexico.
[00:00:50.462 --> 00:00:58.324]  They are inches away from getting a pilot to take them into the area where the reported jihadi base is located.
[00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:00.385]  They have the basic coordinates.
[00:01:01.584 --> 00:01:02.564]  So pray for those guys.
[00:01:02.564 --> 00:01:06.906]  They're going to be joining us with a breakdown of what they've done so far at the bottom of the hour.
[00:01:06.906 --> 00:01:11.048]  They may not be able to do that because the plane may be getting ready to take off right then.
[00:01:11.048 --> 00:01:13.189]  They're trying to make arrangements right now.
[00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.190]  Obviously, most pilots are scared to even do it.
[00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.571]  There's nothing illegal about it.
[00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:19.192]  These are pilots licensed to fly into Mexico.
[00:01:19.192 --> 00:01:23.054]  But we're working on that right now.
[00:01:23.054 --> 00:01:25.175]  And of course, folks will say, well, keep it secret what you're doing.
[00:01:27.213 --> 00:01:30.476]  No, then they could set them up and spin something.
[00:01:30.476 --> 00:01:33.719]  We're openly just reporters doing our job.
[00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:43.947]  Judicial Watch, highly respected, has the documents, has the sources that, well, they admit thousands of jihadist types are coming across.
[00:01:43.947 --> 00:01:45.388]  It's being covered up.
[00:01:45.388 --> 00:01:47.750]  Congressmen are on record.
[00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.112]  And we're being set up basically for an ISIS attack.
[00:01:50.112 --> 00:01:54.396]  The Pentagon has told the military, don't even wear uniforms out in the open, don't use military
[00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:58.168]  Lingo or jargon.
[00:01:58.168 --> 00:02:01.608]  So we're there to investigate this situation.
[00:02:01.608 --> 00:02:07.670]  And we have the gentleman joining us who got pulled over in Florida by the armored tank and threatened by the police.
[00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.811]  And we've also have some other special guests joining us on special reports today.
[00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:15.012]  It is a jam-packed news transmission.
[00:02:15.012 --> 00:02:17.452]  Huge amounts of intel right after this quick break.
[00:02:17.452 --> 00:02:21.974]  But first off, here is part of Joe Biggs' first report from the border.
[00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:23.514]  See the video at InfoWars.com.
[00:02:36.873 --> 00:02:38.934]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:02:38.934 --> 00:02:41.975]  Right now we are on the border of Juarez, Mexico.
[00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:44.756]  That is right behind me in this area there that's lit up.
[00:02:44.756 --> 00:02:57.000]  We've come out here to investigate an article we saw by Judicial Watch saying that they've got intel that there are basically ISIS sleeper cells, people training over here in an area called Anapra.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.903]  Now we're gonna fly over tomorrow in a single-engine Cessna, a very small plane, try to get low-flying altitude footage of that compound.
[00:03:05.183 --> 00:03:11.265]  And we're also going to go investigate the East Portillo Mountains, which is just west of us in New Mexico.
[00:03:11.265 --> 00:03:19.187]  Now, we've shown you time and time again how these borders are intentionally left wide open, that a threat like ISIS could possibly come across.
[00:03:19.187 --> 00:03:21.808]  Now, a lot of people go, well, ISIS is funded by America.
[00:03:21.808 --> 00:03:22.588]  Yeah, we got that.
[00:03:22.588 --> 00:03:23.849]  We know that we accidentally dropped
[00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.449]  I think?
[00:03:40.214 --> 00:03:41.175]  We're good to go.
[00:04:07.267 --> 00:04:09.028]  That's an excellent quick report.
[00:04:09.028 --> 00:04:16.031]  We should again add that the FBI says ISIS is in all 50 states, that they are coming across the border, and brace for imminent attack.
[00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:20.072]  And ISIS is publishing videos saying they're going to destroy the United States.
[00:04:20.072 --> 00:04:31.277]  And Joe Big, back in September of last year, went with Josh Owens to that very spot, because he'd been stationed at Fort Bliss when he got out of the Army, there at Biggs Field, strangely enough.
[00:04:31.277 --> 00:04:34.639]  And he had said, this is the type of place, if I was ISIS, I would come across.
[00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:37.100]  Because we knew they were across the border there.
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:45.042]  He said that very spot, that's where they now say the Mexican authorities and others say they are coming across and that it's being allowed to happen.
[00:04:45.042 --> 00:04:48.343]  So we are over the target, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:48.343 --> 00:04:52.164]  We're going to have those reporters on today and they're going to be up in the air, Lord willing.
[00:04:52.164 --> 00:04:54.605]  So give them some prayers for Providence.
[00:04:54.605 --> 00:04:57.086]  InfoWars.com, tip of the spear of real journalism.
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.125]  I was born on the prairies where the wind blew free, and there was nothing to break the light of the sun.
[00:05:05.125 --> 00:05:08.007]  I was born where there were no enclosures.
[00:05:08.007 --> 00:05:09.207]  Geronimo.
[00:05:09.207 --> 00:05:21.876]  I wonder what he thinks of the permanent checkpoints, where you're quizzed about your citizenship, about having to submit to bag searches to ride public transportation, his thoughts on non-violent offenders riding away in prisons.
[00:05:21.876 --> 00:05:25.599]  They say that in these current times we are more, quote, civilized,
[00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.320]  But are we really more free?
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:37.404]  When the Persian army demanded King Leonidas and his Spartans surrender their arms, the outnumbered king shouted, Molon lave, or come and take them.
[00:05:37.404 --> 00:05:43.306]  Even though Leonidas was eventually defeated by a much larger adversary, he is not remembered for his loss.
[00:05:43.706 --> 00:05:47.668]  He lives in history as a beacon of defiance and self-defense.
[00:05:47.668 --> 00:05:51.130]  The desire to disarm the people is nothing new.
[00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:58.614]  Arm yourself with knowledge at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:05:58.614 --> 00:05:59.935]  The experts are clear.
[00:05:59.935 --> 00:06:07.058]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:06:07.058 --> 00:06:11.761]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:13.302 --> 00:06:17.045]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary nascent iodine formula.
[00:06:17.045 --> 00:06:21.268]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:06:21.268 --> 00:06:26.593]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:06:26.593 --> 00:06:27.594]  Not our iodine.
[00:06:27.594 --> 00:06:31.157]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[00:06:31.377 --> 00:06:33.937]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.811]  I want more candy!
[00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:00.712]  I want more video games!
[00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:01.592]  Mine!
[00:07:01.592 --> 00:07:01.732]  Mine!
[00:07:01.732 --> 00:07:01.832]  Mine!
[00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.171]  I think so.
[00:08:08.709 --> 00:08:10.836]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:10.836 --> 00:08:13.705]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:08:16.494 --> 00:08:30.656]  For 2,000 plus miles from South Texas, stretching all the way to the coast of the Pacific Ocean in California, there are giant sectors of complete lawlessness.
[00:08:30.656 --> 00:08:42.699]  75 miles into Arizona, there are signs up telling citizens not to go down major paved roads and saying that up to a third of the state is now under cartel control.
[00:08:42.699 --> 00:08:44.859]  And in that festering criminal zone,
[00:08:46.079 --> 00:08:51.283]  That 2,200-mile pockmarked zone.
[00:08:51.283 --> 00:09:12.079]  The FBI, Homeland Security, members of Congress, and now the Mexican government, all so they don't get the blame when the attacks come, are warning that ISIS has training camps right across the New Mexico-Mexico border and the South Texas, Southeast Texas, Southwest Texas border zone.
[00:09:12.079 --> 00:09:14.341]  Joe Biggs and Josh Owens are there.
[00:09:15.686 --> 00:09:18.848]  And they are investigating the reported training camp.
[00:09:18.848 --> 00:09:31.017]  But we know that thousands of other than Mexicans, you can pull these numbers up, they're mainstream news, come across every month just in that border crossing sector that they're at alone.
[00:09:31.017 --> 00:09:34.020]  And the majority of them are from China.
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.301]  And then after that, they are from the Middle East.
[00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:38.503]  And many of them are jihadis.
[00:09:38.503 --> 00:09:40.845]  And ISIS has said they're infiltrating.
[00:09:42.303 --> 00:09:46.066]  And again, ISIS comes out of Europe, and comes out of England, and comes out of the U.S.
[00:09:46.066 --> 00:09:46.907]  and Canada.
[00:09:46.907 --> 00:09:56.434]  They recruit young, radical Islamists to the secret army that the West was openly funding to launch major
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:14.074]  attacks for four years against Assad in Syria, but also against Egypt, our supposed ally, who CNN then praised the jihadis when they overthrew that government, and to overthrow Qaddafi, who we double-crossed, who for eight years worked with the West and apologized and paid reparations and brought in U.S.
[00:10:14.074 --> 00:10:20.379]  companies and European companies, and then they set him up and brought in the jihadis.
[00:10:20.379 --> 00:10:25.843]  And that is not a good Americana policy to try to destabilize countries and bring in tyrants.
[00:10:25.843 --> 00:10:26.384]  So you've got
[00:10:27.859 --> 00:10:30.360]  Al-Qaeda armed with .50 caliber Barrett's.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.421]  We're showing video of this of your TV viewer at Infowars.com right now.
[00:10:34.421 --> 00:10:38.522]  When they came into Syria and then into Iraq.
[00:10:38.522 --> 00:10:44.463]  So in some cases up to 300 trucks bought in the US.
[00:10:44.463 --> 00:10:46.264]  These are cartels in Chihuahua.
[00:10:47.566 --> 00:10:51.053]  I thought you were rolling ISIS video and it looked almost identical.
[00:10:51.053 --> 00:10:52.677]  And I knew those were American-made trucks.
[00:10:52.677 --> 00:10:58.188]  That is making my head spin how you can put these cartels right next to...
[00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:10.088]  ISIS and it looks like the same people and that's exactly what the State Department and others have been admitting is that the cartels are now linking up with ISIS and they have similar tactics.
[00:11:10.088 --> 00:11:25.502]  In fact, you can put in the headline, Mexican cartels and ISIS have similar tactics are basically merging and then we can show the video of the cartels again but the video I was wanting to show is the ISIS folks coming into Iraq.
[00:11:25.502 --> 00:11:25.763]  Wow!
[00:11:26.872 --> 00:11:28.853]  That looked exactly like ISIS.
[00:11:28.853 --> 00:11:36.119]  You're talking about 30, 40, 50 or maybe more vehicles just taking over entire sectors of Mexico.
[00:11:36.119 --> 00:11:40.582]  To illustrate my point about how lawless it is down there, simply incredible.
[00:11:43.943 --> 00:11:46.265]  I'm going to break this down in detail at the bottom of the hour.
[00:11:46.265 --> 00:11:48.507]  Headline, Infowars.com.
[00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:49.928]  ISIS has camps on the U.S.
[00:11:49.928 --> 00:11:53.510]  border, but Obama says right-wing extremists are the greatest terror threat.
[00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:56.573]  ISIS camps now have been discovered directly across the U.S.
[00:11:56.573 --> 00:11:57.353]  and Mexico border.
[00:11:57.353 --> 00:11:59.015]  That's by Judicial Watch.
[00:11:59.015 --> 00:12:01.657]  I mean, I can't find a time where Judicial Watch was wrong.
[00:12:01.657 --> 00:12:05.780]  They just get government documents, they double-check government sources, they have broken
[00:12:07.935 --> 00:12:10.337]  On Republicans and Democrats, basically everything.
[00:12:10.337 --> 00:12:16.541]  I mean, they were reporting back in 2001, 2002, the Saudi connection to 9-11.
[00:12:16.541 --> 00:12:18.162]  That was one of our sources.
[00:12:18.162 --> 00:12:19.923]  We had folks on from Judicial watch them.
[00:12:19.923 --> 00:12:21.864]  That's now all been confirmed.
[00:12:21.864 --> 00:12:28.969]  And they're saying multiple camps right across the Texas and New Mexico border, only about 30 miles apart from each other.
[00:12:28.969 --> 00:12:36.654]  Because El Paso is very close there in Southwest Texas to the New Mexico.
[00:12:36.654 --> 00:12:37.155]  Mexico
[00:12:38.427 --> 00:12:44.970]  Three corners, you know, kind of three different two states, one country come together right there.
[00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:52.153]  I guess you could say four corners because it's two countries and two states all come together right there, but pretty amazing.
[00:12:52.153 --> 00:12:55.714]  We're going to be breaking that down at the bottom of the hour in details.
[00:12:55.714 --> 00:13:03.277]  We are going to be I think they've got it set a pilot to take them in over the camp.
[00:13:03.277 --> 00:13:06.819]  I talk about it because it actually gives our people in my experience more safety.
[00:13:08.428 --> 00:13:09.810]  Um, from the U.S.
[00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:16.197]  government or somebody else trying to shoot him down and blame it on somebody else or stop him trying to document this camp.
[00:13:16.197 --> 00:13:17.298]  And we're not going to be stopped.
[00:13:17.298 --> 00:13:20.422]  If we get stopped going in by air, we're going to go in by ground.
[00:13:22.267 --> 00:13:27.351]  And I'm not going to announce when that's going to be, obviously, if that happens, but I'll probably have to go down there myself as well.
[00:13:27.351 --> 00:13:33.876]  I'll have to wait until Buckley, who's on vacation, comes back because he grew up and was born in Guatemala and speaks fluent Spanish.
[00:13:33.876 --> 00:13:38.139]  And he's actually hung around down there over the border in that area before.
[00:13:38.139 --> 00:13:43.563]  But I'm not going to get into that story.
[00:13:43.563 --> 00:13:46.685]  So I've got to wait till he gets back till we do that.
[00:13:46.685 --> 00:13:47.966]  But this is a big deal.
[00:13:47.966 --> 00:13:50.428]  We're going to go out there.
[00:13:51.906 --> 00:13:54.107]  And this is obviously a very dangerous area.
[00:13:54.107 --> 00:14:02.689]  I mean, on lakes bordering Mexico down in that area, if you're out jet skiing or on a fishing boat, they'll just drive up and shoot you.
[00:14:02.689 --> 00:14:04.669]  And the politically correct media will try to cover it up.
[00:14:04.669 --> 00:14:12.811]  There have been a lot of cases of that, so pray for the crew down there, Josh Owens and Joe Biggs.
[00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:17.673]  Coming up, dash cam video shows Arizona officer intentionally running over suspect.
[00:14:17.673 --> 00:14:19.133]  I had this in my stack yesterday.
[00:14:20.168 --> 00:14:24.671]  But I didn't cover it because I hadn't had time to investigate the whole story.
[00:14:24.671 --> 00:14:31.015]  I'm going to give you my take on this in just a moment.
[00:14:31.015 --> 00:14:34.997]  I will say that I think the officer should be given a medal.
[00:14:34.997 --> 00:14:37.279]  So we're going to break that down here in just a moment.
[00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:45.704]  Then coming up, Gunther Grass, one of the top German intellectuals, warns of a sleepwalking into World War in final interview.
[00:14:47.179 --> 00:14:58.947]  AFP, Germany's Nobel-winning author, Gunther Grass said he feared humanity was sleepwalking in a world war in the last interview he gave before his death on Monday.
[00:14:58.947 --> 00:15:09.313]  We have on the one side Ukraine whose situation is not improving, in Israel and Palestine things are getting worse, and the disaster of the America left in Iraq, the atrocities of the Islamic State, the problem of Syria.
[00:15:09.313 --> 00:15:14.637]  He told the Spanish newspaper El Paso in the interview published Tuesday, a day after his death.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.843]  We're gonna break down some of his final quotes.
[00:15:19.843 --> 00:15:23.805]  America spent $374 billion on Big Pharma drugs last year alone.
[00:15:23.805 --> 00:15:24.746]  You heard me right.
[00:15:24.746 --> 00:15:26.847]  Talk about a drugged out population.
[00:15:26.847 --> 00:15:31.670]  The main ingredient in the psychotropic drugs is fluoride.
[00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.852]  That's the molecule they build off of.
[00:15:34.852 --> 00:15:39.375]  And $374 billion.
[00:15:39.375 --> 00:15:44.478]  Chicago to pay reparations to police torture victims from the torture compound that was discovered two months ago.
[00:15:46.644 --> 00:15:49.546]  Secret torture compound.
[00:15:49.546 --> 00:15:51.747]  And we're going to get obviously into a ton more.
[00:15:51.747 --> 00:15:53.548]  Joel Gilbert, proven right again.
[00:15:53.548 --> 00:16:07.055]  He said that the communist mentor, top pornographer, top communist, top Soviet spy on record in his sector, Frank Marshall Davis, the real father of Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:16:07.055 --> 00:16:07.615]  It's undoubted.
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.462]  His film, where he's my real father, we sell it on Infowars.com.
[00:16:11.462 --> 00:16:13.964]  I didn't even believe it when I first saw it and checked it and I couldn't believe it.
[00:16:13.964 --> 00:16:17.046]  I mean, this film will really freak you out.
[00:16:17.046 --> 00:16:19.008]  And the whole Kenya thing was a bait and switch.
[00:16:19.008 --> 00:16:22.651]  We're going to break that down in the last 30 minutes, the broadcast today.
[00:16:22.651 --> 00:16:27.134]  But he has now basically been vindicated.
[00:16:27.134 --> 00:16:32.879]  Obama has come out and said he owes his worldviews to Frank Marshall Davis.
[00:16:33.999 --> 00:16:35.620]  It's unbelievable.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:40.164]  The video, the audio is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:16:40.164 --> 00:16:42.106]  Simply amazing.
[00:16:42.106 --> 00:16:47.931]  And we saw the pornography he shot with a woman that's the exact spitting image of Obama's mother.
[00:16:47.931 --> 00:16:51.474]  On the same couch, in the same house.
[00:16:51.474 --> 00:16:55.137]  I mean, it's the same pictures on the wall.
[00:16:55.137 --> 00:16:58.900]  Where Davis shot these Betty Page style porns.
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:16:59.841]  And then it's his mother.
[00:17:00.836 --> 00:17:04.397]  And then he would spend whole summers there for at least 10 years with him.
[00:17:04.397 --> 00:17:08.458]  And his grandfather, who was CIA, was Frank Marshall Davis's quote, best friend.
[00:17:08.458 --> 00:17:18.240]  I mean, that's in his book, Dreams of My Father, Obama's book, that he lived with Davis, a top communist pornographer.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.881]  And then we've got his mother from the private collection.
[00:17:22.961 --> 00:17:25.522]  That Gilbert was able to purchase.
[00:17:25.522 --> 00:17:28.003]  They've not denied it, and it's his mother.
[00:17:28.003 --> 00:17:29.904]  They didn't put a lot of the photos in the film.
[00:17:29.904 --> 00:17:31.725]  Boy, let me tell you.
[00:17:31.725 --> 00:17:34.086]  But, back in the day, they didn't have video.
[00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:35.867]  People traded photos.
[00:17:35.867 --> 00:17:37.547]  And, fine, she's in pornography.
[00:17:37.547 --> 00:17:38.748]  I'm not judging her.
[00:17:38.748 --> 00:17:44.030]  The thing is, she did that to be compromised.
[00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.111]  And this is, this was her boyfriend.
[00:17:47.557 --> 00:17:51.840]  And that's why he said in the Harvard Review that he was from Kenya.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.943]  He was the editor of the Harvard Review, and in three years he was the editor.
[00:17:56.943 --> 00:18:00.025]  Every issue for a month, I mean, what's three times twelve?
[00:18:00.025 --> 00:18:03.187]  That many times he said, I am from Kenya.
[00:18:03.187 --> 00:18:04.708]  I was born in Kenya.
[00:18:04.708 --> 00:18:06.389]  His father looks nothing like him.
[00:18:06.389 --> 00:18:07.489]  Then they said he never said that.
[00:18:07.489 --> 00:18:10.251]  Then his wife said in two speeches in 2007 that he was from Kenya.
[00:18:16.701 --> 00:18:18.503]  Born in Kenya.
[00:18:18.503 --> 00:18:27.090]  So that we would all believe that, and then fight over that, hiding the fact that his dad is Frank Marshall Davis the Communist.
[00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:29.653]  And he's now come out and said that he owes everything to that.
[00:18:29.653 --> 00:18:37.179]  I'm going to play the clip before he joins us, but... I mean, it's just over the top, and that's what the globalists will do.
[00:18:37.179 --> 00:18:37.700]  They admit that.
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.984]  They'll do stuff so over the top, and so bold, and so brazen,
[00:18:45.103 --> 00:18:48.326]  That people can't even believe it.
[00:18:48.326 --> 00:18:52.369]  Our president, who is the spitting image of Frank Marshall Davis, I mean, it's him.
[00:18:52.369 --> 00:18:53.410]  That's his daddy.
[00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:59.135]  I mean, you look at my dad, you look at me, you look at my dad when he was my age, I mean, that's my daddy.
[00:18:59.135 --> 00:19:00.776]  You look at my mother, that's my mama.
[00:19:00.776 --> 00:19:02.798]  I mean, I look like my mama.
[00:19:02.798 --> 00:19:04.399]  Probably more than my daddy.
[00:19:04.399 --> 00:19:05.700]  Probably 60% look like my mother.
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.862]  40% like my dad.
[00:19:08.862 --> 00:19:12.906]  And then you look at Frank Marshall Davis, I mean, it is Barack Obama's daddy.
[00:19:14.181 --> 00:19:21.886]  And he is a communist known KGB officer and a top pornographer to fund the communist operation.
[00:19:21.886 --> 00:19:24.707]  And he was connected in with groups like the Weathermen and others.
[00:19:24.707 --> 00:19:27.649]  You know how they funded themselves.
[00:19:27.649 --> 00:19:28.870]  Bank robberies, you name it.
[00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.271]  I mean, you just can't make it up.
[00:19:30.271 --> 00:19:34.513]  I mean, we are in the hands of hardcore scum.
[00:19:34.513 --> 00:19:36.774]  I mean, we are in trouble.
[00:19:36.774 --> 00:19:39.376]  They are trying to bring this country down, Cloward and Pivenstile.
[00:19:42.637 --> 00:19:44.098]  I mean, he lived with Davis!
[00:19:44.098 --> 00:19:45.599]  It's his daddy!
[00:19:45.599 --> 00:19:47.940]  Looks just like him!
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.242]  And then he comes out and says it!
[00:19:50.242 --> 00:19:51.762]  Even talks like him!
[00:19:51.762 --> 00:19:53.483]  Talks like his daddy!
[00:19:53.483 --> 00:19:55.004]  It's his daddy!
[00:19:55.004 --> 00:19:57.266]  Not that guy over there in Kenya looks nothing like him!
[00:19:57.266 --> 00:19:59.347]  Stay with us, we're gonna come back with the cops.
[00:19:59.347 --> 00:20:09.273]  From the producers of the multi-award-winning documentary, A Noble Lie, Oklahoma City 1995, Free Mind Films is proud to announce the release of their third film, Shadow Ring.

[00:21:57.967 --> 00:21:59.047]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:21:59.047 --> 00:22:07.071]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds, I lift weights 5 days a week, I can swim 2-3 miles.
[00:22:07.071 --> 00:22:10.232]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[00:22:10.232 --> 00:22:12.213]  I started an access television show.
[00:22:12.213 --> 00:22:16.975]  I was so dedicated to my work, and hanging around with radio guys, that I began drinking.
[00:22:17.575 --> 00:22:20.958]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:27.024]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut.
[00:22:27.024 --> 00:22:32.309]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[00:22:32.309 --> 00:22:37.473]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[00:22:37.473 --> 00:22:38.895]  When I added to the mix

[00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:23.267]  It's definitely loaded.
[00:24:23.267 --> 00:24:30.349]  Have units be prepared.
[00:24:30.349 --> 00:24:34.010]  Is it subject shooting or did you shoot?
[00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:36.051]  Negative, it did not shoot.
[00:24:36.051 --> 00:24:37.691]  Unit right there, just stand off, stand off.
[00:24:37.691 --> 00:24:39.032]  The gun is loaded.
[00:24:39.032 --> 00:24:42.033]  Unit on Cotero Park, stay off.
[00:24:49.409 --> 00:24:50.890]  Jesus Christ, man down!
[00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:59.993]  435, 454.
[00:24:59.993 --> 00:25:03.395]  451, he's down, he's down.
[00:25:03.395 --> 00:25:07.296]  Uh, unit right there, just stand off, stand off, the gun is loaded.
[00:25:07.296 --> 00:25:17.420]  Unit on... Stay off!
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.101]  Christ, man down!
[00:25:18.101 --> 00:25:18.601]  You know what?
[00:25:22.381 --> 00:25:27.944]  This video came out yesterday, and I didn't have time to research it, so I didn't play the clip.
[00:25:27.944 --> 00:25:31.166]  If you're a TV viewer, you obviously just saw that.
[00:25:31.166 --> 00:25:37.730]  If you're a radio listener, you probably heard about it or have seen it on the news, but the video is up on Infowars.com.
[00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:43.734]  Dash cam video shows Arizona officer intentionally running over suspect.
[00:25:43.734 --> 00:25:48.977]  And they've got the civil rights groups out all freaking out.
[00:25:48.977 --> 00:25:50.618]  When this gentleman
[00:25:51.849 --> 00:25:54.810]  On record.
[00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:58.370]  And I've got a whole list of the things he did.
[00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:02.971]  He robbed a 7-Eleven with a club, metal club.
[00:26:02.971 --> 00:26:07.772]  Then an hour later, he set fire to a church.
[00:26:07.772 --> 00:26:09.552]  And reportedly, I think he did a bunch of other stuff too.
[00:26:09.552 --> 00:26:11.173]  Stole a car.
[00:26:11.173 --> 00:26:14.193]  Went in, manhandled a 30-30 in ammo at Walmart.
[00:26:14.193 --> 00:26:16.214]  Threatened a bunch of people.
[00:26:16.214 --> 00:26:17.694]  Basically shot at the cops.
[00:26:19.497 --> 00:26:26.322]  I mean, if somebody's got a gun waving around shooting, I'm gonna get out from behind the door and I'm gonna shoot the guy with a rifle.
[00:26:26.322 --> 00:26:36.228]  I mean, there's not... And then see, there's other cops pulling up, and I guess they were just gonna let themselves get shot, so the other cop just decides to ram him.
[00:26:36.228 --> 00:26:43.553]  Which is unorthodox, but that's the type of thing you want, in my view, if people are inside a school, shooting people.
[00:26:44.724 --> 00:26:48.388]  I mean, that stuff didn't go on a long time ago because everybody had guns inside the school.
[00:26:48.388 --> 00:26:49.089]  The principal did.
[00:26:49.089 --> 00:26:52.954]  There were guns in their trucks outside and you wouldn't get away with it.
[00:26:52.954 --> 00:26:55.417]  And in the old days, the cops would just run right in and shoot you.
[00:26:55.417 --> 00:27:00.022]  But nowadays, they wait until a SWAT team gets there and they sit around for two or three hours.
[00:27:00.022 --> 00:27:01.624]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:27:01.624 --> 00:27:03.626]  And so, you know, you could say the guy's a hothead.
[00:27:04.648 --> 00:27:08.011]  And you can say he made a mistake, you can say he crashed the police car.
[00:27:08.011 --> 00:27:15.678]  As far as you got a guy waving a rifle around that's just burning down buildings, robbing people, aiming guns, shooting guns.
[00:27:15.678 --> 00:27:17.239]  I mean, it's just, end of story.
[00:27:17.239 --> 00:27:22.624]  You can march all day with your gun, as long as you're not pointing it at people.
[00:27:22.624 --> 00:27:26.608]  I'm pro-Second Amendment, but I'm not for lunatics going around killing people.
[00:27:27.412 --> 00:27:36.095]  And now they've got the different civil rights organizations freaking out, saying everything in the video seems to point towards an obvious excessive use of force.
[00:27:36.095 --> 00:27:38.756]  Really, the guy's still alive.
[00:27:38.756 --> 00:27:42.958]  If I'd have been the cop that was already there and the guy's shooting, I'd have just got out and shot the guy.
[00:27:42.958 --> 00:27:47.559]  I mean, just no-brainer, you're running around shooting at people, I'm going to kill you.
[00:27:47.559 --> 00:27:49.060]  I don't need any police training to know that.
[00:27:49.991 --> 00:27:51.472]  There's somebody walking around shooting a gun out here.
[00:27:51.472 --> 00:27:53.333]  I'm gonna get my rifle.
[00:27:53.333 --> 00:27:54.774]  I'm gonna just take my time.
[00:27:54.774 --> 00:27:56.075]  I'm gonna look at what's behind the target.
[00:27:56.075 --> 00:27:58.377]  I'm gonna pull the trigger.
[00:27:58.377 --> 00:28:00.158]  I mean, it's real simple.
[00:28:00.158 --> 00:28:02.499]  And that's why we've got shotguns, too.
[00:28:02.499 --> 00:28:04.641]  So we don't shoot people in another building.
[00:28:08.083 --> 00:28:11.184]  But regardless, let's say in the heat of the moment I didn't think.
[00:28:11.184 --> 00:28:16.966]  Everything is intent and I got a rifle and then it ricocheted off some building down the street.
[00:28:16.966 --> 00:28:20.127]  I wouldn't get in trouble because my intent was to stop someone doing harm.
[00:28:20.127 --> 00:28:21.488]  It's the same thing with a cop.
[00:28:21.488 --> 00:28:27.870]  You have to be in the heat of the moment yourself to then be able to judge in my view.
[00:28:28.615 --> 00:28:37.142]  And they're looking at suspending or firing the cop right now, but then now they're going back the other way saying, no, no, maybe he acted, you know, the right to put the guy down.
[00:28:37.142 --> 00:28:46.569]  But that just shows the extreme nature of the anti-police movement that's funded by George Soros and the left, that no matter what they do, they're attacked.
[00:28:46.569 --> 00:28:50.912]  And then you have the police responding in an extreme way, defending bad cops then.
[00:28:50.912 --> 00:28:52.994]  No, go after bad cops that are obviously bad.
[00:28:54.721 --> 00:28:58.704]  You grab somebody for no reason, put them in handcuffs, pull your gun out, shoot them in the back, you need to get life in prison.
[00:28:58.704 --> 00:29:00.445]  Or executed.
[00:29:00.445 --> 00:29:08.190]  You shoot some guy running away, and then make jokes about it, and then plant a taser, that's premeditated murder.
[00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:10.431]  So don't defend people like that, there are bad guys out there.
[00:29:10.431 --> 00:29:21.178]  But then, to go to the next extreme, when there's somebody going around with a gun, shooting it, and he's just robbed and been stealing and burning buildings down,
[00:29:25.027 --> 00:29:32.630]  I mean, that's just a no-brainer response.
[00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:36.672]  So we're going to come back and shift gears out of that story and get into bad police conduct.
[00:29:36.672 --> 00:29:39.333]  Chicago to pay reparations to police torture victims.
[00:29:39.333 --> 00:29:45.096]  We may be able to get our reporters up with news on the Alcata base right over the Texas border and more.
[00:29:45.096 --> 00:29:45.456]  Stay with us.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:52.122]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.122 --> 00:29:59.026]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.026 --> 00:30:00.987]  The BLM is at it again.
[00:30:00.987 --> 00:30:06.270]  This time they're not trying to take a rancher's grazing rights, pretending that they're protecting an endangered species.
[00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:11.713]  Now they're going after the mining rights of one of the oldest continuing claims in the U.S.
[00:30:11.713 --> 00:30:14.975]  So old, that it's protected under the General Mining Act of 1872.
[00:30:17.376 --> 00:30:22.120]  And they're not even giving the lawyers for the miners a reason, let alone a day in court.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:30.607]  The Gliese Mining District in Oregon reports that one of the mine owners has been given a cease and desist order with a deadline of Saturday, April the 25th.
[00:30:30.607 --> 00:30:36.391]  They must remove all equipment and buildings and fill in the tunnels by then, which is impossible.
[00:30:36.391 --> 00:30:43.417]  The owners of the Sugar Pine Mine have stated that they will fully disobey the order they say is illegal and invalid, and they have called for assistance.
[00:30:43.797 --> 00:30:48.604]  Local chapters of Oath Keepers and Three Percenters have responded, and others are on the way.
[00:30:48.604 --> 00:30:54.292]  For more information and updates as the situation develops, stay tuned to the Alex Jones Radio Show and the Nightly News.

[00:30:59.059 --> 00:31:00.160]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.423]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds.
[00:31:04.423 --> 00:31:06.545]  I lift weights five days a week.
[00:31:06.545 --> 00:31:08.186]  I can swim two, three miles.
[00:31:08.186 --> 00:31:11.349]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[00:31:11.349 --> 00:31:13.310]  I started an access television show.
[00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:18.694]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[00:31:18.694 --> 00:31:21.557]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[00:31:22.077 --> 00:31:28.142]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a Jabba the Hutt.
[00:31:28.142 --> 00:31:33.406]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[00:31:33.406 --> 00:31:38.290]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:45.975]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Groot for InfoWarsLife.com, the results were incredible.

[00:33:26.009 --> 00:33:27.451]  Monday through Friday, we're here.
[00:33:28.516 --> 00:33:29.476]  No compromise.
[00:33:29.476 --> 00:33:30.537]  Hardcore.
[00:33:30.537 --> 00:33:32.297]  In the face of the globalists.
[00:33:32.297 --> 00:33:33.717]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.717 --> 00:33:35.538]  Dedicated to telling the truth.
[00:33:35.538 --> 00:33:38.099]  Dedicated to researching history.
[00:33:38.099 --> 00:33:40.519]  Dedicated to taking on the globalists.
[00:33:40.519 --> 00:33:46.541]  And I have assembled an amazing team of men and women who are dedicated to liberty and telling the truth as well.
[00:33:47.381 --> 00:33:54.587]  We are about to go to Joe Biggs and Josh Owens right there on the Texas border.
[00:33:54.587 --> 00:33:55.988]  I know they're planning to go into Mexico.
[00:33:55.988 --> 00:33:58.571]  They may be in Mexico, it looks like it, from the Skype feed.
[00:33:58.571 --> 00:34:07.398]  If you're a radio listener, you can go to InfoWars.com forward slash show to find the free video feed right now so you can actually see our guys there on the ground.
[00:34:08.559 --> 00:34:15.440]  Here's the headline, Infowars.com, economic collapse blog story, ISIS has camps on the U.S.
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:20.241]  border, but Obama says right-wing extremists are the greatest terror threat.
[00:34:20.241 --> 00:34:22.642]  ISIS camps have now been discovered directly across the U.S.
[00:34:22.642 --> 00:34:33.064]  border with Mexico, and we've now confirmed that these training drills, like the one in California last weekend, are to take on sovereign citizens, veterans, and gun owners, as we predicted.
[00:34:33.804 --> 00:34:40.246]  Now from Florida to California, the videos are coming in, and they are targeting to round up patriots.
[00:34:40.246 --> 00:34:43.847]  Gee, wonder why InfoWars was banned from the exercise.
[00:34:43.847 --> 00:34:48.368]  Judicial Watch, highly respected, has got the intel, the documents.
[00:34:48.368 --> 00:34:50.109]  Congressmen have gone public as well.
[00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:56.511]  We know thousands a month, other than Mexicans, many of them Middle Eastern, come across the border.
[00:34:56.511 --> 00:35:00.192]  Joe Biggs, who was stationed at Fort Bliss before he got out of the Army as a Staff Sergeant,
[00:35:01.755 --> 00:35:10.080]  Wanted to go down there last year saying they say ISIS is over the border from South Texas with the early reports that have now been confirmed.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.542]  I want to go down there and show where I think they'd come across.
[00:35:13.542 --> 00:35:17.705]  Right by the city park on the edge of El Paso where it's a half foot deep water.
[00:35:18.584 --> 00:35:27.246]  Turns out Judicial Watch with the Mexican authorities and others have come out and said that exact one mile stretch is indeed where they're coming through.
[00:35:27.246 --> 00:35:33.407]  And a quarter mile from there, they leave these huge gates open at night and we have that footage as well.
[00:35:33.407 --> 00:35:38.188]  So we're going to condense all this together into one special report tonight on the news.
[00:35:38.188 --> 00:35:39.309]  But Joe Biggs is there.
[00:35:39.309 --> 00:35:41.269]  They're working on getting an aircraft.
[00:35:41.269 --> 00:35:42.529]  At this point, I've said they're going in.
[00:35:42.529 --> 00:35:45.290]  I don't want to give too much about did they get one or when this is going to happen.
[00:35:47.092 --> 00:35:54.643]  It's very soon, but Joe's going to give us a breakdown of what's happened so far via the magic of Skype there on the border.
[00:35:54.643 --> 00:35:59.871]  Joe Biggs and Josh Owens, you left yesterday at about 6, filed a report late last night.
[00:35:59.871 --> 00:36:00.832]  What have you learned since?
[00:36:00.832 --> 00:36:01.493]  Break it all down.
[00:36:02.705 --> 00:36:06.909]  Well right now, Alex, we are standing outside of Annapurna.
[00:36:06.909 --> 00:36:15.436]  Annapurna is the area that is listed in the Judicial Watch Report stating that there is a possible ISIS terror cell operating over there.
[00:36:15.436 --> 00:36:19.180]  That place is pretty much run by a lot of the drug cartels.
[00:36:19.784 --> 00:36:21.305]  From Juarez.
[00:36:21.305 --> 00:36:23.647]  So we're standing on this mountain range just on the other side.
[00:36:23.647 --> 00:36:26.249]  If we walk across though here, we could be in an opera.
[00:36:26.249 --> 00:36:38.958]  But yes, like you said earlier, we're trying to work on an aircraft right now, a small plane, to be able to hover over this area and fly around and try to get some footage and possibly spot this area and get that footage out to you guys.
[00:36:39.238 --> 00:36:40.619]  I see the El Norte train.
[00:36:40.619 --> 00:36:45.763]  That's one of the actual trains the illegals jump on by the tens of thousands a day to come into the U.S.
[00:36:45.763 --> 00:36:47.805]  Don't see any on that one.
[00:36:47.805 --> 00:36:54.490]  But that is just an amazing image of you out there in the desert and the mountains with the train going through.
[00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:57.572]  Yeah, there's a lot of activity out here.
[00:36:57.572 --> 00:36:59.334]  I mean, this is the one area though
[00:37:00.123 --> 00:37:03.264]  Where the Border Patrol actually have to have their armored vehicles.
[00:37:03.264 --> 00:37:08.105]  They have to have the cages up over the windows because Annapurna is a pretty bad area.
[00:37:08.105 --> 00:37:16.507]  I mean, Juarez is bad given, but this place right here, the actual border fence, which is not even that great, is right along the side of the city.
[00:37:16.507 --> 00:37:20.728]  So, just splitting between, you know, the U.S.
[00:37:20.728 --> 00:37:23.949]  and Annapurna is this little fence, so... I can see the fence.
[00:37:23.949 --> 00:37:25.729]  Looks like you're, what, about 600 yards from that?
[00:37:26.904 --> 00:37:34.928]  Uh, yeah, it ends though right over my left shoulder and then there's nothing going up really that much up to the top of the hill.
[00:37:34.928 --> 00:37:40.331]  How many yards away would you say from the end of that black fence we see right there?
[00:37:40.331 --> 00:37:42.292]  Uh, about 800.
[00:37:42.292 --> 00:37:43.152]  800 yards?
[00:37:43.152 --> 00:37:44.833]  Yeah.
[00:37:44.833 --> 00:37:48.375]  This is about the best view that we could get up high enough so you could actually see the city.
[00:37:50.043 --> 00:37:57.493]  Well, I want to talk to you off air during the next break to decide what we're going to do, but everything's looking good right now?
[00:37:58.749 --> 00:37:59.850]  Everything is good thus far.
[00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:01.992]  I'm trying to work on a couple different plans.
[00:38:01.992 --> 00:38:08.997]  Like I said, we're going to try to take a trip out to the East Portillo Mountains tomorrow, which is about an hour and 20 minute drive.
[00:38:08.997 --> 00:38:17.864]  I'll possibly try to fly over that today as well, because they said that's where the ISIS spotters are posted up in that mountain ridge, trying to look over the Mexican border.
[00:38:17.864 --> 00:38:20.406]  And then when they give them the all clear, they signal them through.
[00:38:21.701 --> 00:38:22.142]  Amazing.
[00:38:22.142 --> 00:38:24.644]  Again, Judicial Watch says the camp's there.
[00:38:24.644 --> 00:38:26.686]  Congress people say they're coming across.
[00:38:26.686 --> 00:38:28.649]  They've been caught coming across.
[00:38:28.649 --> 00:38:38.059]  Why do you think they'd want to whitewash this and cover this up and then have one of the biggest domestic exercises ever to take on patriots at the same time?
[00:38:38.059 --> 00:38:39.060]  What do you think's going on, Joe?
[00:38:40.046 --> 00:38:44.568]  Well, I mean, even the local news around here is just saying, oh, you know, we contacted Border Patrol officials.
[00:38:44.568 --> 00:38:51.412]  They say that this article from the Watch is basically bogus, and there's no evidence to support these claims.
[00:38:51.412 --> 00:38:53.733]  You know, and this is what we've been hearing for the past year, Alex.
[00:38:53.733 --> 00:38:58.335]  I mean, we keep hearing that, you know, this isn't happening, the border's secure, it's not wide open.
[00:38:58.335 --> 00:39:08.921]  And then eventually, somebody releases an article, shows pictures, where they've captured four, you know, Iraqi guys with, you know, that are ISIS sympathizers, and they're flying prayer rugs, and they're flying, you know,
[00:39:09.705 --> 00:39:15.952]  Translation books from Arabic and Arduro to English and all this stuff out here in prayer beads.
[00:39:15.952 --> 00:39:17.493]  So there's something definitely going on.
[00:39:17.493 --> 00:39:22.699]  Well, it's the Border Patrol people that are actually leaking the information.
[00:39:22.699 --> 00:39:25.762]  And it's in their reports thousands other than Mexican.
[00:39:25.762 --> 00:39:27.003]  That's what they call it in the reports.
[00:39:27.003 --> 00:39:30.647]  You can see Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Libya.
[00:39:31.465 --> 00:39:43.224]  But then it's not just that, there's also other jihadis from western countries coming in, and this is where they're coming into the country, and it's just amazing that they're trying to cover this up, because they don't want folks to know the border is wide open.
[00:39:44.505 --> 00:39:50.932]  Yeah, because, you know, then that means that it shows that their almighty Obama is not doing his job just like he promises he is.
[00:39:50.932 --> 00:39:53.374]  Because most of the sheep think he's doing a great job right now.
[00:39:53.374 --> 00:39:59.861]  If they actually came out here to the border, that's what I tell people all the time, people always want to get mad and yell at me like, oh, you don't know what you're talking about.
[00:39:59.861 --> 00:40:01.122]  You're just crazy.
[00:40:01.122 --> 00:40:03.084]  Well, I've actually been out here numerous times.
[00:40:03.084 --> 00:40:05.787]  This is like my fifth trip to El Paso in the last year.
[00:40:06.568 --> 00:40:24.171]  Um, nothing's changed, nothing is improved, the border's completely and totally wide open in many places, maybe not the entire border, everywhere, but all you need is a gap, and that word of mouth travels down south, and everyone knows where that gap is, and they exploit it, and they go through it, and there's nothing being done to stop it or patch it up.
[00:40:24.667 --> 00:40:33.213]  Well sure, and of course, still the Obamanoids support Obama, but the majority of Americans in all the polls aren't buying it, so that's why the media is trying to keep clamps on it.
[00:40:33.213 --> 00:40:47.423]  But Jacari Jackson and our other reporters last year went down to McAllen, also in South Texas, because of our Border Patrol sources, and they were there saying they're ordered to let the illegals through, and they give them vouchers and ship them in.
[00:40:47.423 --> 00:40:53.348]  And that's now mainstream media, so they don't want this getting out, but it is getting out that it's happening.
[00:40:54.056 --> 00:41:01.340]  But the funny thing is, though, is when I go out and I show the borders where they're open, you know, the Border Patrol will try and sometimes hassle you.
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:03.461]  Sometimes they'll be like, oh, what are you doing out this way?
[00:41:03.461 --> 00:41:04.762]  You can't get close to the border.
[00:41:04.762 --> 00:41:05.722]  I'll be like, why not?
[00:41:05.722 --> 00:41:06.783]  You're letting illegals through.
[00:41:06.783 --> 00:41:11.825]  Why can't I, as a citizen, walk on my own soil, which is all the way up to the fence?
[00:41:11.825 --> 00:41:13.446]  I can go wherever I want to.
[00:41:13.446 --> 00:41:18.649]  So they want to try to hassle people sometimes, which I think is just trying to help cover up the fact that the border's open.
[00:41:18.769 --> 00:41:19.931]  Well sure, that's their order.
[00:41:19.931 --> 00:41:23.415]  They get reprimanded or fired if they report on the illegals coming in.
[00:41:23.415 --> 00:41:24.617]  That's in the news.
[00:41:24.617 --> 00:41:27.280]  And they're even told let them go when they commit crimes.
[00:41:28.206 --> 00:41:32.009]  Because that's what the criminal, illegitimate government wants.
[00:41:32.009 --> 00:41:37.554]  Just because the Border Patrol, most of them, follow their orders, doesn't mean that we're going to follow the globalist operations.
[00:41:37.554 --> 00:41:39.636]  And again, I don't want to just make the Border Patrol the enemy here.
[00:41:39.636 --> 00:41:48.964]  They're really upset about what's happening, but at the same time, they're just replacing them with these political officers that will engage in the treason.
[00:41:48.964 --> 00:41:50.666]  And I have been down at the border myself.
[00:41:51.584 --> 00:42:12.529]  We have footage of it, down by Big Bend, and they have the Border Patrol spotting, with their binoculars and radios, college kids, but also adults, drinking beer on the Rio Grande and throwing footballs, and then they come up and give you tickets, while the illegals come across right in front of them.
[00:42:12.529 --> 00:42:14.910]  So, they're not allowed to do that.
[00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:16.030]  I've seen that tons of times.
[00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:19.751]  I mean, quite frankly, almost every trip I've been on, I see Border Patrol agents
[00:42:20.291 --> 00:42:21.732]  They're not allowed to do their job.
[00:42:21.732 --> 00:42:22.753]  They've been bordered.
[00:42:22.753 --> 00:42:27.576]  I mean, it was in the news two weeks ago, like Associated Press, I remember the headline, Border Patrol ordered to ignore large groups of illegals.
[00:42:49.138 --> 00:42:49.358]  Yeah.
[00:42:49.358 --> 00:42:51.280]  And then you don't even know who's in that large group who has...
[00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.630]  Yes.
[00:43:23.397 --> 00:43:27.799]  A power grid location that we did some reports from last time when Josh Owens and I were here.
[00:43:27.799 --> 00:43:29.080]  These are big targets.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:32.982]  You have White Sands Missile Range where there's a lot of military stuff that goes on there.
[00:43:32.982 --> 00:43:36.763]  There's a lot of stuff out here where a potential attack could happen.
[00:43:36.763 --> 00:43:41.586]  I mean, just over this other, on the other side of the mountain over here, you have the University of Texas El Paso.
[00:43:41.586 --> 00:43:43.767]  This is a prime spot for something like that.
[00:43:43.767 --> 00:43:45.588]  That's why they need to spend money on fixing the border.
[00:43:45.588 --> 00:43:46.728]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[00:43:46.728 --> 00:43:52.411]  They need the security, they need to beef up the security out here and they're not doing it because all of this stuff right now
[00:43:53.118 --> 00:43:55.799]  It's just sad that they're not doing anything about it.
[00:43:55.799 --> 00:44:04.582]  Well, how are they going to get away with it when their Al-Qaeda boys, ISIS boys, attack a mall or attack that university or attack the military base?
[00:44:04.582 --> 00:44:13.965]  I mean, imagine 500 or 50, 10, whatever the number's going to be, Major Hassans attacking the base, and they won't even call it a terror attack when it happens.
[00:44:13.965 --> 00:44:19.967]  I mean, it's just incredible because they've got to keep that border open to collapse us into the North American Union, Joe.
[00:44:21.803 --> 00:44:22.784]  Yeah, I mean exactly.
[00:44:22.784 --> 00:44:24.446]  I totally agree.
[00:44:24.446 --> 00:44:27.809]  So hopefully we can get some information out here while we're out here today.
[00:44:27.809 --> 00:44:35.997]  We're still waiting on this confirmation from a pilot to get out here and get footage over Arapa and then get down to the East Portillo Mountains as well.
[00:44:36.491 --> 00:44:38.614]  All right, I know you guys can go in there as well.
[00:44:38.614 --> 00:44:41.417]  We're in the Judicial Watch documents.
[00:44:41.417 --> 00:44:42.979]  They're saying... Oh, one other thing, too, though.
[00:44:42.979 --> 00:44:48.746]  The East Portillo Mountains, from what I've been looking into, is mostly overlooked by BLM.
[00:44:48.746 --> 00:44:53.072]  So if there's BLM there, then there's also these, you know, reports of ISIS spotters, you know.
[00:44:53.072 --> 00:44:54.133]  That's another thing to think about.
[00:44:54.133 --> 00:44:54.794]  What's going on there?
[00:44:56.274 --> 00:45:02.876]  Well, our government at the highest levels has been criminally aiding and abetting the leadership of ISIS, which is just Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
[00:45:02.876 --> 00:45:04.636]  I mean, they admit that.
[00:45:04.636 --> 00:45:11.678]  And so, just to confuse the public, it'd be too much if the government got caught funding Al-Qaeda, so they just changed the name to confuse people.
[00:45:11.678 --> 00:45:14.759]  It's just really incredible that this is happening.
[00:45:14.759 --> 00:45:15.999]  And Joe, if you see the Border Patrol,
[00:45:17.268 --> 00:45:21.151]  Usually they follow you and act like you've done something wrong, or the state police.
[00:45:21.151 --> 00:45:21.872]  Go over to them!
[00:45:21.872 --> 00:45:24.794]  I mean, we're not the enemy, even though they've been trained we are.
[00:45:24.794 --> 00:45:29.337]  And say, hey, you know, are you aware of these Judicial Watch reports?
[00:45:29.337 --> 00:45:32.779]  And I mean, obviously, they're going to say, go talk to Public Affairs.
[00:45:32.779 --> 00:45:37.483]  And you go talk to Public Affairs, they'll give you a card and call you in a thousand years.
[00:45:37.483 --> 00:45:38.884]  But just continue.
[00:45:38.884 --> 00:45:42.907]  You can do a mail on the street, asking folks if they're aware of what's going on.
[00:45:42.907 --> 00:45:44.888]  Joe Biggs and Josh Owens, a great job.
[00:45:44.888 --> 00:45:45.829]  You guys be safe down there.
[00:45:47.714 --> 00:45:52.097]  Alright, there they go from right there at the border.
[00:45:52.097 --> 00:45:56.860]  And it's already Mui Caliente down there.
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:00.883]  Alright, let me now shift back into the news.
[00:46:00.883 --> 00:46:05.706]  There is obviously so much of it.
[00:46:05.706 --> 00:46:06.067]  This is...
[00:46:07.612 --> 00:46:09.134]  Really bizarre.
[00:46:09.134 --> 00:46:17.746]  Leaking of government officials addresses accompanied by note warning of FEMA crackdown by New World Order Satanist.
[00:46:17.746 --> 00:46:21.851]  Publication of sensitive material blamed on right-wing hackers.
[00:46:21.851 --> 00:46:22.132]  We're gonna...
[00:46:22.532 --> 00:46:26.616]  Print that article off and cover that coming up in the next segment.
[00:46:26.616 --> 00:46:28.498]  You have the video that he shot last night.
[00:46:28.498 --> 00:46:30.460]  ISIS camp discovered at U.S.
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:31.641]  border.
[00:46:31.641 --> 00:46:35.225]  Questions swirl over bizarre Walmart closures.
[00:46:35.225 --> 00:46:39.570]  We're learning that they've not called out permits on the supposed plumbing.
[00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:44.395]  You know that's made up when it was six, now it's eight Walmarts in the South.
[00:46:46.881 --> 00:46:48.322]  Are they turning into low-income housing?
[00:46:48.322 --> 00:46:49.763]  That's what one tip said.
[00:46:49.763 --> 00:46:54.966]  Is it shutting them down because people trying to unionize?
[00:46:54.966 --> 00:46:57.347]  Did Chinese communists buy Walmart?
[00:46:57.347 --> 00:46:59.609]  I mean, these are the stories all coming out.
[00:46:59.609 --> 00:47:00.909]  It's kind of a whodunit.
[00:47:00.909 --> 00:47:01.990]  What do you think's going on?
[00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:08.214]  There's another video of my son and Morgan Do, Rob Do's son.
[00:47:09.657 --> 00:47:18.660]  On children beg state to let them go outside, CPS grabbing children from normal homes for them children being allowed to play outside.
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:25.002]  Meanwhile, a detailed report, TSA workers caught manipulating body scanners, groped genitals for sexual gratification.
[00:47:25.002 --> 00:47:26.762]  That broke in CBS News yesterday.
[00:47:26.762 --> 00:47:29.383]  We show you some of the history of it.
[00:47:29.383 --> 00:47:35.905]  Hillary visits college, puts everyday Iowans on lockdown when she comes, then calls herself just a normal person.
[00:47:37.679 --> 00:47:41.403]  And goes on to say that she's going to wage war against basically the 1%.
[00:47:41.403 --> 00:47:43.285]  Number one, that's all a fraud.
[00:47:43.285 --> 00:47:54.938]  If you make, I think it's like $250,000 a year, it depends on inflation, maybe almost $300,000 now, but if you make $300,000 a year, let's just give a high-end number to make sure we're accurate, you are in the 1%.
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:00.384]  I wish that, you know, 10% made $300,000 or 20%.
[00:48:00.384 --> 00:48:03.388]  You'd really have a booming economy then.
[00:48:03.388 --> 00:48:10.297]  Every economist knows a big middle class is key to an upwardly mobile working class.
[00:48:10.297 --> 00:48:11.139]  Blue collar folks.
[00:48:12.554 --> 00:48:17.716]  That's the entrepreneur middle class in every culture that is the engine.
[00:48:17.716 --> 00:48:21.717]  And big elites, the ultra-rich, always wage war against it to consolidate power.
[00:48:21.717 --> 00:48:24.618]  Because their next big competition is coming out of the middle class.
[00:48:24.618 --> 00:48:26.478]  And political opposition is coming out.
[00:48:26.478 --> 00:48:27.559]  Because they can't be bought.
[00:48:27.559 --> 00:48:28.679]  They have their own thing.
[00:48:28.679 --> 00:48:30.320]  They don't want to be under your control.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.640]  They don't want centralized board.
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:45.908]  And so, when we sit there and attack Hillary and go, oh yeah, you're funded by the 1%, but you claim they're fighting them, we almost give in to this class warfare, myself included, that 1% is bad.
[00:48:45.908 --> 00:48:53.053]  We did the math last year, I forget the exact math, I think it was .0, it was 7 zeros, and then a 2.3.
[00:48:53.053 --> 00:49:01.339]  Because if you go off the Rothkopf-Henry Kissinger group, say there's 6,000 people that own and run the world, I agree with that number, it's a little big, but let's say 6,000, you average
[00:49:05.831 --> 00:49:18.375]  6,000 into the different global wealth numbers that are out there, and they vary, but you always come up with a .000000 and then some numbers that has half the wealth and growing.
[00:49:18.375 --> 00:49:21.536]  In a few years, we're set to have 60% of the wealth.
[00:49:21.536 --> 00:49:33.619]  To a man and a woman, these rich, globalist billionaires, except for a few families, fund taking your guns, getting rid of borders, taking your family, breaking up the family,
[00:49:37.844 --> 00:49:44.951]  The richest percentile of Americans make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, so how could $135,000 salary make you a one-percenter?
[00:49:44.951 --> 00:49:46.913]  Now see, that's an article out of, what, the Daily Beast?
[00:49:46.913 --> 00:49:48.835]  Well, that's out of The Atlantic.
[00:49:50.285 --> 00:49:51.846]  So they're saying $135,000.
[00:49:51.846 --> 00:49:54.268]  The numbers I've seen is really about $300,000.
[00:49:54.268 --> 00:49:57.050]  Because the rich are good at hiding their money.
[00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:59.032]  But the point is, who buys cars?
[00:49:59.032 --> 00:50:00.133]  Who goes to restaurants?
[00:50:00.133 --> 00:50:01.374]  Who gets their hair done?
[00:50:01.374 --> 00:50:02.915]  Who puts a swimming pool in?
[00:50:02.915 --> 00:50:04.096]  Who hires nannies?
[00:50:04.096 --> 00:50:05.617]  Who sends people to college?
[00:50:05.617 --> 00:50:09.800]  Who, you know, donates land for a park?
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:12.242]  It's the middle class.
[00:50:12.242 --> 00:50:14.724]  And so Hillary says the problem is people making $135,000 a year.
[00:50:14.724 --> 00:50:14.884]  Well, no.
[00:50:19.795 --> 00:50:20.815]  No, no, no.
[00:50:20.815 --> 00:50:26.877]  It's billionaires like George Soros that get their money from government bailouts and Warren Buffett.
[00:50:26.877 --> 00:50:35.900]  So when we come back, we have a couple clips here of Hillary at the university, acting like a regular lady when they shut the whole place down for the piece of garbage.
[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:38.841]  I'm running for president because I think the Americans and their families need a champion.
[00:50:38.841 --> 00:50:42.142]  And then she goes into how she's going to battle the 1%.
[00:50:42.142 --> 00:50:43.483]  Well, actually, it's true!
[00:50:43.483 --> 00:50:44.663]  Hillary's telling the truth!
[00:50:46.434 --> 00:50:47.136]  That's the headline.
[00:50:47.136 --> 00:50:49.482]  Hillary's telling the truth about battling the 1%.
[00:50:49.482 --> 00:50:53.511]  She wants to get rid of the lower 99.99999% of the 1% that's her enemy for the super elite.
[00:50:58.843 --> 00:51:08.145]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:51:08.145 --> 00:51:08.925]  This capitalism?
[00:51:08.925 --> 00:51:15.107]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:51:15.107 --> 00:51:18.788]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:51:18.788 --> 00:51:19.748]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:51:19.748 --> 00:51:21.108]  It's time to understand the system.

[00:51:21.448 --> 00:51:21.728]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:51:29.246 --> 00:51:30.046]  Bugging out?
[00:51:30.046 --> 00:51:32.047]  What if you don't make it to your bug-out location?
[00:51:32.047 --> 00:51:35.168]  Could you survive in the woods for days, weeks, years?

[00:51:58.357 --> 00:51:59.298]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[00:51:59.298 --> 00:51:59.859]  Good, brother.
[00:51:59.859 --> 00:52:01.821]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:52:01.821 --> 00:52:03.542]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:52:03.542 --> 00:52:07.547]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:52:07.547 --> 00:52:10.189]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:52:10.189 --> 00:52:12.612]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:52:12.612 --> 00:52:20.580]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:24.024]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:52:24.024 --> 00:52:25.546]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:52:25.546 --> 00:52:30.251]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, saving a ton of money there.
[00:52:30.251 --> 00:52:35.657]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[00:52:35.717 --> 00:52:36.337]  We're good to go.
[00:52:58.061 --> 00:53:01.884]  Last year, in the Nevada desert, one family took a stand for freedom.
[00:53:01.884 --> 00:53:06.387]  Numana Food Storage was the first and only company to support the rights of the Bundys.
[00:53:06.387 --> 00:53:12.832]  While others stood down, Numana took donations and provided storable foods to the men at Bunkerville.
[00:53:12.832 --> 00:53:19.837]  Founded by patriots who believe in liberty, Numana Food Storage is GMO-free, great tasting, and easy to prepare.
[00:53:19.837 --> 00:53:20.998]  Food is freedom!
[00:53:20.998 --> 00:53:23.520]  Buy Numana today at powerprepper.com.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:27.083]  Numana, food storage you'll love to eat, at powerprepper.com.
[00:53:28.211 --> 00:53:29.432]  Hear that?
[00:53:29.432 --> 00:53:34.817]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:53:34.817 --> 00:53:37.759]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:53:37.759 --> 00:53:41.302]  You can prevent being the next victim of a break-in.
[00:53:41.302 --> 00:53:48.868]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[00:53:48.868 --> 00:53:53.472]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[00:53:53.472 --> 00:53:55.914]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[00:53:55.914 --> 00:53:57.075]  Faketv.com
[00:54:04.212 --> 00:54:09.033]  We're back, and here is Hillary, who's going to battle the insiders.
[00:54:09.033 --> 00:54:09.553]  What a joke.
[00:54:09.553 --> 00:54:14.134]  I just want to tell you a little bit about why I'm here today.
[00:54:14.134 --> 00:54:22.395]  I think we all know that Americans have come back from some pretty tough economic times.
[00:54:22.395 --> 00:54:31.297]  And our economy and our country are much better off because American families have basically done whatever it took to make it work.
[00:54:32.397 --> 00:54:40.859]  But I think it's fair to say that as you look across the country, the deck is still stacked in favor of those already at the top.
[00:54:40.859 --> 00:54:42.239]  Yeah, you helped rig it that long.
[00:54:42.239 --> 00:54:44.420]  There's something wrong with that.
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:45.900]  There's something wrong with... Oh, really?
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:47.821]  You helped change the laws for derivatives.
[00:54:47.821 --> 00:54:49.841]  ...more than the typical worker.
[00:54:49.841 --> 00:54:54.662]  There's something wrong when American workers keep getting more productive as they have.
[00:54:54.662 --> 00:54:57.023]  And as I just saw a few minutes ago... You see, they do this?
[00:54:58.424 --> 00:55:01.406]  And then don't go after the actual elite, but then just raise taxes.
[00:55:01.406 --> 00:55:05.529]  Obama almost got two to one money from hedge fund people than the guy he ran against.
[00:55:17.017 --> 00:55:29.147]  And there's something wrong when students and their families have to go deeply into debt to be able to get the education and skills they need in order to make the best of their own lives.
[00:55:29.147 --> 00:55:30.528]  And I looked at the figures.
[00:55:30.528 --> 00:55:35.753]  The average Iowa graduate from a four-year college comes out with nearly $30,000 in debt.
[00:55:42.735 --> 00:55:48.360]  And that's, I think, the ninth highest debt load in the country.
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:50.501]  And people are struggling.
[00:55:50.501 --> 00:55:59.649]  I met earlier today with a young student who is piecing together work and loans.
[00:55:59.649 --> 00:56:03.553]  Knowing full well he's going to come out owing a lot of money.
[00:56:05.037 --> 00:56:11.018]  So we've got to figure out in our country how to get back on the right track.
[00:56:11.018 --> 00:56:17.220]  And I'm running for president because I think that Americans and their families need a champion.
[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:17.860]  Oh my goodness.
[00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:19.360]  And I want to be that champion.
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:26.662]  I want to stand up and fight for people so that they can not just get by, but they can get ahead.
[00:56:26.662 --> 00:56:27.682]  And they can stay ahead.
[00:56:27.682 --> 00:56:32.003]  And that's why for, that's propaganda from CNN carrying that.
[00:56:32.003 --> 00:56:32.823]  We're analyzing it.
[00:56:34.952 --> 00:56:48.600]  That's why you have presided for 25 years over the dismantling of the country, and the debt bubbles, and the college garbage, and all of it, and then you want to sit up there and act like you're fighting it?
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:52.422]  By the way, the guys were able to pull up my breakdown from Forbes.
[00:56:52.422 --> 00:56:53.383]  Are you rich enough?
[00:56:53.383 --> 00:56:56.765]  The terrible tragedy of income inequality among the 1%.
[00:56:58.871 --> 00:57:09.534]  And it goes on to say, the 1% starts at 300,000, what I had said, according to Berkeley's Emanuel Sayes.
[00:57:09.534 --> 00:57:20.758]  Not until you get to the top 1 tenth of 1%, with an income of 1.9 million a year, do you achieve the velocity and start to escape Earth's monetary gravitational field.
[00:57:20.758 --> 00:57:22.779]  And that is, again, the top 10% of 1%, and then you look at
[00:57:25.049 --> 00:57:32.659]  Just the top, top, top few percent, that's the 1,000 plus, I think it's like 1,200 and something billionaires.
[00:57:32.659 --> 00:57:36.684]  And then above them are the super ultra rich whose money is a state secret.
[00:57:36.684 --> 00:57:43.093]  And that, of course, is the British royalty, the Rothschilds, and the Dutch royalty, all of their wealth are state secrets.
[00:57:44.233 --> 00:57:49.536]  What's not a state secret is that we are funded by viewers and radio listeners like you.
[00:57:49.536 --> 00:57:58.721]  Thank you for supporting our local sponsors, our local affiliates, and by purchasing high-quality water filtration systems that cut out the fluoride and all the other garbage at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:58:11.106 --> 00:58:22.068]  We're running the Alex Jones Challenge Pack Special, the three things that supercharged my muscle gain and fat loss and health in the 45-day trial I did where I lost six pounds of fat and gained muscle.
[00:58:22.068 --> 00:58:27.190]  You can see the video at infowars.com, accelerating my journey back to being in good shape.
[00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:29.372]  Yeah, I gained 99 pounds, folks.
[00:58:29.372 --> 00:58:30.894]  I've lost 60 plus.
[00:58:30.894 --> 00:58:32.496]  But it's available at InfoWarsLive.com.

[00:58:48.678 --> 00:58:49.258]  I want more candy!
[00:58:49.258 --> 00:58:50.399]  I want more video games!
[00:58:50.399 --> 00:58:50.599]  Mine!
[00:58:50.599 --> 00:58:51.099]  Mine!
[00:58:51.099 --> 00:58:51.919]  Mine!
[00:58:51.919 --> 00:59:01.642]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:59:01.642 --> 00:59:04.343]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:59:04.343 --> 00:59:07.704]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:59:07.924 --> 00:59:14.228]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[00:59:14.228 --> 00:59:19.370]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:25.754]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[00:59:25.754 --> 00:59:33.498]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[00:59:33.498 --> 00:59:36.740]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:38.482]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:04.775 --> 01:00:06.096]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.096 --> 01:00:07.857]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.857 --> 01:00:09.618]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.618 --> 01:00:11.199]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.199 --> 01:00:12.740]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:16.942]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.942 --> 01:00:23.125]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.125 --> 01:00:25.987]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:00:25.987 --> 01:00:31.390]  I haven't even mentioned the fact yet that it's April 15th.
[01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:32.731]  The real April Fool's Day.
[01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:46.556]  It was back in 1913 that we got rid of senators being elected by the legislatures, so the states could no longer have a checkmate on federal corruption and power grabs.
[01:00:46.556 --> 01:00:56.801]  And we got the private Federal Reserve and its funding mechanism by its collection agency, the Internal Revenue Service, we got the income tax.
[01:00:56.801 --> 01:01:00.682]  All in December of 1913, now 101 years ago.
[01:01:05.751 --> 01:01:09.233]  And we've lived under it now for three generations.
[01:01:09.233 --> 01:01:17.257]  Three generations, really four generations have now lived in this system.
[01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:24.161]  Like Ron Paul said, 1913 was not a very good year, was it?
[01:01:24.161 --> 01:01:32.026]  We have Lucas Jewell joining us at the bottom of the hour who got pulled over by the armored MRAP in Florida, formerly one of the producers for Adam Kokesh.
[01:01:33.271 --> 01:01:54.685]  And we got Joel Gilbert popping in on a clip I'm going to play coming up where Obama comes out and thanks and says he owes basically everything to Frank Marshall Davis, the top communist pornographer, who is his real daddy.
[01:01:54.685 --> 01:01:57.627]  And shot some kinky porn with mama.
[01:02:00.393 --> 01:02:01.173]  Obama's mama.
[01:02:01.173 --> 01:02:02.734]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[01:02:02.734 --> 01:02:04.494]  I mean, I just... Pinch me?
[01:02:04.494 --> 01:02:05.274]  Am I dreaming?
[01:02:05.274 --> 01:02:14.677]  It just gets weirder and weirder and weirder and weirder and crazier.
[01:02:14.677 --> 01:02:21.459]  I mean, we have a Nazi collaborator funding the takeover of Real Media.
[01:02:21.459 --> 01:02:25.200]  Trying to finance destroying the middle class and opening our borders.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.601]  Funding a war with Russia and the overthrow of Ukraine.
[01:02:34.099 --> 01:02:36.722]  And he's just walking around.
[01:02:36.722 --> 01:02:51.136]  We've got Obama, the bizarro son of a communist pornographer, who he admittedly lived with when he was a kid.
[01:02:51.136 --> 01:02:52.638]  It's just a freak show, man!
[01:02:54.065 --> 01:02:56.167]  It's a takeover.
[01:02:56.167 --> 01:02:58.449]  You wonder who would want to take America over?
[01:02:58.449 --> 01:02:59.710]  Scum?
[01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:00.791]  Trash?
[01:03:00.791 --> 01:03:01.731]  Filth?
[01:03:01.731 --> 01:03:02.872]  Mental patients?
[01:03:02.872 --> 01:03:04.133]  Devils?
[01:03:04.133 --> 01:03:05.995]  I don't know what you want to call them.
[01:03:05.995 --> 01:03:08.257]  Who would want to wreck a free market bonanza?
[01:03:08.257 --> 01:03:10.038]  Who would want to wreck all this liberty?
[01:03:10.038 --> 01:03:11.520]  Who would want to wreck all this prosperity?
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:15.343]  There's a reason everybody was kicking and screaming for a hundred plus years to get here.
[01:03:17.261 --> 01:03:20.222]  Because compared to other places, America was really nice.
[01:03:20.222 --> 01:03:26.604]  I mean, if you live in Switzerland or Luxembourg or something and you're real rich and part of the power structure, it's nice.
[01:03:26.604 --> 01:03:33.085]  If you're not from there and aren't part of the in-crowd, it's not that good and you can't afford to live.
[01:03:33.085 --> 01:03:33.826]  New Zealand.
[01:03:33.826 --> 01:03:35.366]  I've been there, but no folks that have been.
[01:03:35.366 --> 01:03:38.907]  It's nice for now until everybody gets the word and goes there.
[01:03:38.907 --> 01:03:42.108]  And it's too socialist, but it's beautiful.
[01:03:42.108 --> 01:03:43.588]  But beauty does not make the place a...
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.680]  Utopia.
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:56.802]  The only real utopia is liberty and freedom and the animating contest of competition.
[01:03:56.802 --> 01:04:05.063]  And within the imperfectness of that contest and that experience is utopia.
[01:04:05.063 --> 01:04:17.826]  I've got to say that adversity and exultation and victory and defeat and struggle and success and failure and all that goes into it is fantastic!
[01:04:19.224 --> 01:04:25.770]  It's fun to sneak into the desert and try to find an Al Qaeda base, even though it's dangerous.
[01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:29.653]  It's fun to sneak into Bohemian Grove and be questioned by the Secret Service.
[01:04:29.653 --> 01:04:39.641]  And to get the video and infiltrate successfully, blow their operation, have them break in our hotel rooms, grab our stuff in the mail and everything else and still have copies outside of that that ended up hitting the world.
[01:04:39.641 --> 01:04:43.445]  It's fun to expose the open borders and break a national news story.
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:46.103]  And to show they're shipping the illegals in.
[01:04:46.103 --> 01:04:50.730]  It's fun to expose that they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines and make them take it out.
[01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:52.854]  It's fun to have victory over evil.
[01:04:52.854 --> 01:04:54.316]  It's fun to do good.
[01:04:54.316 --> 01:04:57.081]  The soul grows in the sunlight of God.
[01:04:58.709 --> 01:05:03.293]  Your Federal Reserve tribute known as the income tax is due on April 15th.
[01:05:03.293 --> 01:05:07.836]  That is, unless you're one of the following Fortune 500 companies that aren't paying any taxes.
[01:05:07.836 --> 01:05:15.082]  Daily Mail reports the Fortune 500 companies that didn't pay a penny in 2014 income tax despite being worth billions.
[01:05:15.082 --> 01:05:21.708]  Some of the companies include CBS, Mattel, Prudential, Time Warner, Owens Corning, JetBlue, Xerox,
[01:05:22.088 --> 01:05:25.291]  Priceline.com and perennial bomb maker General Electric.
[01:05:25.291 --> 01:05:28.014]  Some of these companies even got tax rebates back.
[01:05:28.014 --> 01:05:29.335]  Are you serious?
[01:05:29.335 --> 01:05:33.059]  Thank goodness we have Hillary Clinton who's now attacking the 1%.
[01:05:33.059 --> 01:05:34.600]  She really means it.
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:41.507]  Did you know that Ronald Reagan's Grace Commission report found that one-third of all income taxes are consumed by waste and inefficiency in the federal government?
[01:05:41.947 --> 01:05:50.192]  And 100% of what is collected is absorbed solely by interest on the federal debt, which means that your tax dollars are paid to the private, run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[01:05:50.192 --> 01:05:55.054]  Bow down to your overlords and pay your stinking taxes, unless you're one of these Fortune 500 companies.
[01:05:55.054 --> 01:05:57.496]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:06:58.488 --> 01:06:59.609]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:59.609 --> 01:07:03.851]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds.
[01:07:03.851 --> 01:07:05.972]  I lift weights five days a week.
[01:07:05.972 --> 01:07:07.633]  I can swim two, three miles.
[01:07:07.633 --> 01:07:10.795]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[01:07:10.795 --> 01:07:12.756]  I started an access television show.
[01:07:12.756 --> 01:07:18.138]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[01:07:18.138 --> 01:07:21.000]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:27.586]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a Jabba the Hutt.
[01:07:27.586 --> 01:07:32.851]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[01:07:32.851 --> 01:07:38.016]  I started taking Super Mel Vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[01:07:38.016 --> 01:07:39.458]  When I added to the mix
[01:07:39.798 --> 01:07:44.003]  The key products developed by Dr. Group for InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:44.003 --> 01:07:45.424]  The results were incredible.
[01:07:45.424 --> 01:07:50.730]  Take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call.
[01:07:50.730 --> 01:07:53.714]  They can answer all your questions or tell you about any of the specials at 888-253-3139.
[01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:08.290]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:12.593]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.593 --> 01:08:14.715]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:08:14.715 --> 01:08:17.137]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:08:17.137 --> 01:08:21.201]  12 noon Eastern to 3 pm Eastern.
[01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:24.704]  That'd be 9 am to noon Pacific.
[01:08:24.704 --> 01:08:27.166]  10 am to 1 pm Mountain.
[01:08:27.166 --> 01:08:29.108]  11 am to 2 pm Central Standard Time.
[01:08:30.287 --> 01:08:36.953]  Coming up, we have the gentleman pulled over by the MRAP armored truck in Florida.
[01:08:36.953 --> 01:08:39.275]  We're going to get his take on that situation briefly.
[01:08:39.275 --> 01:08:45.961]  Then we have the filmmaker, Joel Gilbert, who made Dreams of My Real Father.
[01:08:45.961 --> 01:08:52.987]  We've now had congressmen come out and point out that Obama was raised by a communist pornographer, a top communist.
[01:08:52.987 --> 01:08:55.550]  I mean, it was fun about the Soviets to run newspapers nationwide.
[01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:57.732]  I mean, you're talking, you know, in the committees.
[01:08:59.508 --> 01:09:01.550]  Working for people that killed tens of millions.
[01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:03.792]  I mean, just super creepy.
[01:09:03.792 --> 01:09:05.354]  Tied into the Weathermen, all of them.
[01:09:05.354 --> 01:09:07.696]  I mean, this is a sinister group.
[01:09:07.696 --> 01:09:14.362]  And now Obama's come out and said, yeah, he basically learned everything from Frank Marshall Davis, who we know in his own book.
[01:09:14.362 --> 01:09:18.246]  Obama says he grew up with him and stayed with him on summers, and his grandfather was best friends with him.
[01:09:18.666 --> 01:09:31.054]  Yeah, and your mother basically was his girl and shot porn with him, and we've got him in the same house you were raised in, with photos of you in the house, on the same couch, in the same room, with the same pictures, where the porn's shot!
[01:09:31.054 --> 01:09:34.977]  And what's crazy is that no one picked that up!
[01:09:34.977 --> 01:09:40.640]  They'll pick up, he's from Kenya all day, and I admit it, we got fooled by that.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.321]  I admitted all that.
[01:09:42.267 --> 01:09:56.817]  Because, again, he was the editor of the Harvard Law Review for multiple years, and in the foreword to it said, you know, it's a great honor as someone born in Kenya and, you know, to be here now at Harvard and blah blah blah.
[01:09:56.817 --> 01:10:07.485]  And then his wife in the campaign, in the first campaign saying he was born in Kenya, and they put out fake birth certificates to upset us, to mess with us, to make us take the bait.
[01:10:10.009 --> 01:10:28.496]  I mean, they put out the typewriter font is the Microsoft Word font selection, where each typewriter, like a snowflake, is a different blob, micro-splats, like a ice flake, like a snowflake.
[01:10:28.496 --> 01:10:36.539]  All I did when it came out with RobDude, the first thing I did was, and it was in layers, we put out that it was in layers, got millions of views, you know, huge viral videos, we were the first.
[01:10:36.539 --> 01:10:38.480]  And I'm not a forensics person, but I'm not stupid.
[01:10:40.282 --> 01:10:41.882]  I know how to look at something and see if it's my signature.
[01:10:41.882 --> 01:10:46.604]  And the first thing we noticed is it was in seven layers.
[01:10:46.604 --> 01:10:47.984]  And people said, well, that was an accident.
[01:10:47.984 --> 01:10:49.124]  They split the layers.
[01:10:49.124 --> 01:10:52.405]  There wouldn't be layers if it wasn't in layers before.
[01:10:52.405 --> 01:10:54.066]  It was a fake scan.
[01:10:54.066 --> 01:10:59.607]  And they put it out as the document to make it obvious.
[01:10:59.607 --> 01:11:03.268]  Only now, in hindsight, we figure all this out.
[01:11:03.268 --> 01:11:05.609]  So it was a deliberate forgery to get us off track.
[01:11:06.547 --> 01:11:07.388]  Along with everything else.
[01:11:07.388 --> 01:11:08.449]  Him not looking like his dad.
[01:11:08.449 --> 01:11:09.891]  On and on and on.
[01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:12.515]  The government not thinking it was his dad and throwing him out of the U.S.
[01:11:12.515 --> 01:11:13.576]  The fake commie dad.
[01:11:13.576 --> 01:11:15.519]  That was just their cover.
[01:11:17.532 --> 01:11:25.674]  So that we would never look at what was in his own book, Hiding in Plain View, that he spent summers with Frank Marshall Davis.
[01:11:25.674 --> 01:11:33.395]  That is just such a big deal because then they can blackmail Obama and control him with all of that information.
[01:11:33.395 --> 01:11:39.876]  The videos on Infowars.com, Obama admits, noted communist, schooled him on white racism.
[01:11:39.876 --> 01:11:41.757]  I'm going to play that clip in a moment.
[01:11:42.771 --> 01:11:46.612]  And then, I've got something very exciting I want to announce to listeners.
[01:11:46.612 --> 01:11:55.234]  I threw this initiative out just a week ago, and our great reporters and researchers have hit the ground running.
[01:11:55.234 --> 01:11:58.014]  So I've got something really exciting I'm going to announce and play here in a moment.
[01:11:58.014 --> 01:12:08.796]  But first, here is that clip ahead of the guest joining us of Obama talking about Frank Marshall Davis, the guy that published communist newspapers all over the U.S., big ones.
[01:12:08.796 --> 01:12:11.517]  Worked for the Central Committee, KGB operative,
[01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:17.012]  Just incredible.
[01:12:17.012 --> 01:12:20.295]  And he also ran distribution of a major porn operation.
[01:12:20.295 --> 01:12:22.177]  That's how communists make their money.
[01:12:22.177 --> 01:12:23.538]  That and robbing banks and stuff.
[01:12:23.538 --> 01:12:25.620]  That's the weatherman though.
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:28.363]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[01:12:29.864 --> 01:12:39.550]  And the passage finally ends with me having a conversation with a close friend of my maternal grandfather, a close friend of Gramps, a black man from Kansas named Frank.
[01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:46.595]  Actually, at the time, a fairly well-known poet named Frank Marshall Davis, who had moved to Hawaii and lived there.
[01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:57.322]  And so I have a discussion with him about the kinds of frustrations I'm having, and he sort of schools me on that I should get used to these frustrations.
[01:12:57.322 --> 01:12:59.184]  So let me dig in.
[01:13:01.885 --> 01:13:03.785]  And you look at him, he is his father's son.
[01:13:03.785 --> 01:13:10.847]  I mean, that is daddy.
[01:13:10.847 --> 01:13:12.868]  Unbelievable.
[01:13:12.868 --> 01:13:16.529]  Go see the video at InfoWars.com if you're a radio listener.
[01:13:16.529 --> 01:13:17.869]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:13:17.869 --> 01:13:20.930]  You can see it right there.
[01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:23.131]  Totally blows me away.
[01:13:23.131 --> 01:13:24.111]  Totally blows me away.
[01:13:25.287 --> 01:13:27.108]  Now let's shift gears into some good news.
[01:13:27.108 --> 01:13:28.829]  You know, I had a thought.
[01:13:28.829 --> 01:13:33.753]  On the internet-only streams, I'm going to put some of these on the network as well so radio listeners can hear them.
[01:13:33.753 --> 01:13:38.756]  We have the podcast ads, is what I call them, that just the folks on the streams, the video feeds see.
[01:13:38.756 --> 01:13:41.298]  Still a huge audience, but not as big as the MNFM audience.
[01:13:41.298 --> 01:13:42.999]  It's probably 80% of our audience.
[01:13:42.999 --> 01:13:43.759]  Millions every day.
[01:13:43.759 --> 01:13:44.520]  But we have rated
[01:13:45.782 --> 01:13:53.065]  Last time we got ad agency condensed numbers that is a boil down only on stations subscribing to the rating system.
[01:13:53.065 --> 01:13:54.445]  You have to subscribe to the numbers.
[01:13:54.445 --> 01:13:58.787]  About 3 million listeners a day terrestrial radio.
[01:13:58.787 --> 01:14:00.587]  And it's grown since then.
[01:14:00.587 --> 01:14:02.628]  I'm told it's about 4 million.
[01:14:02.628 --> 01:14:06.649]  That's very important because that's a big mass of people that we're able to hit.
[01:14:06.649 --> 01:14:11.751]  You can tell Friends and Family, tune into this local AM or FM station.
[01:14:11.751 --> 01:14:13.492]  But also I'd like to have
[01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:27.066]  It's part of the ads, and I'm going to have this, because I only have a few of the ads on the network, but I'm going to have to do this, where there are little one-minute evergreen reports about the history of liberty and standing up for freedom and this great continuum, but also breaking news reports and analysis.
[01:14:27.066 --> 01:14:29.588]  And I, boom, heard one air this morning.
[01:14:29.588 --> 01:14:37.214]  I asked Jakari to do it last week, and he just did a great one that's just one-minute inspirational.
[01:14:37.214 --> 01:14:41.777]  And then I just heard one that Rob Dew did, perfect for Tax Day today.
[01:14:41.777 --> 01:14:43.559]  He's our news director on the nightly news.
[01:14:44.670 --> 01:14:45.590]  That's what I love about my crew.
[01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:48.091]  Just wild horses, can't drag them away.
[01:14:48.091 --> 01:14:48.811]  They all want to work.
[01:14:48.811 --> 01:14:53.432]  They're up to like eight or nine, and as they go home, it's your family, but they bring their kids up here because they want to fight the tyranny.
[01:14:53.432 --> 01:14:55.592]  I mean, it's just, it's like target fixation.
[01:14:55.592 --> 01:14:59.073]  When you're in a B-17 shooting at Messerschmitts coming in, you don't want to stop.
[01:14:59.073 --> 01:15:01.633]  I mean, it's just, you're committed.
[01:15:01.633 --> 01:15:02.194]  That's good.
[01:15:02.194 --> 01:15:03.394]  It's a fighting spirit.
[01:15:03.394 --> 01:15:05.934]  And then I haven't heard David Nights yet, but I'm sure it's going to be excellent as well.
[01:15:05.934 --> 01:15:14.276]  So we're also going to take some of these and put video to them on Airmen of the Nightly News, but you'll be hearing these during the breaks here on the radio show.
[01:15:15.816 --> 01:15:21.337]  So let's go ahead and go to a compilation of three of these that are airing today during the breaks.
[01:15:23.124 --> 01:15:29.226]  I was born on the prairies where the wind blew free, and there was nothing to break the light of the sun.
[01:15:29.226 --> 01:15:32.127]  I was born where there were no enclosures.
[01:15:32.127 --> 01:15:33.327]  Geronimo.
[01:15:33.327 --> 01:15:45.991]  I wonder what he thinks of the permanent checkpoints, where you're quizzed about your citizenship, about having to submit to bag searches to ride public transportation, his thoughts on non-violent offenders riding away in prisons.
[01:15:45.991 --> 01:15:49.692]  They say that in these current times we are more, quote, civilized,
[01:15:49.932 --> 01:15:52.453]  But are we really more free?
[01:15:52.453 --> 01:16:01.514]  When the Persian army demanded King Leonidas and his Spartans surrender their arms, the outnumbered king shouted, Molon lave, or come and take them.
[01:16:01.514 --> 01:16:07.816]  Even though Leonidas was eventually defeated by a much larger adversary, he is not remembered for his loss.
[01:16:07.816 --> 01:16:11.796]  He lives in history as a beacon of defiance and self-defense.
[01:16:11.796 --> 01:16:14.877]  The desire to disarm the people is nothing new.
[01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:22.544]  Arm yourself with knowledge at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:27.129]  Your Federal Reserve tribute known as the income tax is due on April 15th.
[01:16:27.129 --> 01:16:31.693]  That is, unless you're one of the following Fortune 500 companies that aren't paying any taxes.
[01:16:31.693 --> 01:16:38.360]  Daily Mail reports, the Fortune 500 companies that didn't pay a penny in 2014 income tax despite being worth billions.
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:49.142]  Some of the companies include CBS, Mattel, Prudential, Time Warner, Owens Corning, JetBlue, Xerox, Priceline.com, and perennial bomb maker General Electric.
[01:16:49.142 --> 01:16:51.843]  Some of these companies even got tax rebates back.
[01:16:51.843 --> 01:16:53.163]  Are you serious?
[01:16:53.163 --> 01:16:56.904]  Thank goodness we have Hillary Clinton who's now attacking the 1%.
[01:16:56.904 --> 01:16:58.424]  She really means it.
[01:16:58.424 --> 01:17:05.346]  Did you know that Ronald Reagan's Grace Commission report found that one-third of all income taxes are consumed by waste and inefficiency in the federal government?
[01:17:05.786 --> 01:17:14.036]  And 100% of what is collected is absorbed solely by interest on the federal debt, which means that your tax dollars are paid to the private, run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[01:17:14.036 --> 01:17:18.901]  Bow down to your overlords and pay your stinking taxes, unless you're one of these Fortune 500 companies.
[01:17:18.901 --> 01:17:21.344]  Rob Dew, reporting for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:17:22.245 --> 01:17:24.226]  The BLM is at it again.
[01:17:24.226 --> 01:17:29.508]  This time they're not trying to take a rancher's grazing rights, pretending that they're protecting an endangered species.
[01:17:29.508 --> 01:17:34.950]  Now they're going after the mining rights of one of the oldest continuing claims in the U.S.
[01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:38.191]  So old, that it's protected under the General Mining Act of 1872.
[01:17:40.612 --> 01:17:45.356]  And they're not even giving the lawyers for the miners a reason, let alone a day in court.
[01:17:45.356 --> 01:17:53.203]  The Gleas Mining District in Oregon reports that one of the mine owners has been given a cease and desist order with a deadline of Saturday, April the 25th.
[01:17:53.203 --> 01:17:59.248]  They must remove all equipment and buildings and fill in the tunnels by then, which is impossible.
[01:17:59.628 --> 01:18:07.036]  The owners of the Sugar Pine Mine have stated that they will fully disobey the order they say is illegal and invalid, and they have called for assistance.
[01:18:07.036 --> 01:18:11.861]  Local chapters of Oath Keepers and Three Percenters have responded, and others are on the way.
[01:18:11.861 --> 01:18:17.547]  For more information and updates as the situation develops, stay tuned to the Alex Jones Radio Show and the Nightly News.
[01:18:17.547 --> 01:18:21.532]  Or, go to Infowars.com and our YouTube channel, the Alex Jones Channel.
[01:18:22.856 --> 01:18:28.518]  And spread the word to your friends and family about the local AM and FM stations that you're listening to and support their local sponsors.
[01:18:28.518 --> 01:18:29.378]  Here's my frustration.
[01:18:29.378 --> 01:18:36.380]  It's why I need two or three more camera people, two or three more ground reporters, and three or four more writers.
[01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:46.223]  I need to be able to send, I think, Jakari Jackson and maybe Marcos Morales or somebody, I'm not sure, out to this Oregon situation as it develops.
[01:18:46.223 --> 01:18:47.524]  I mean, I covered it some yesterday.
[01:18:50.097 --> 01:18:54.039]  They have total rights under federal and state law.
[01:18:54.039 --> 01:18:57.841]  They believe only about 1% of the gold's been taken out of this.
[01:18:57.841 --> 01:19:02.603]  It's the clean type of gold mine compared to some of the others that use cyanide.
[01:19:02.603 --> 01:19:04.524]  They've shut down almost all our mines in this country.
[01:19:04.524 --> 01:19:06.865]  It's a joke.
[01:19:06.865 --> 01:19:08.545]  And they're not even giving a reason under law.
[01:19:08.545 --> 01:19:10.366]  They're just saying, we're doing it.
[01:19:10.366 --> 01:19:15.549]  And that's because the globalist creditors want everything kept in the ground until they take over.
[01:19:15.549 --> 01:19:18.230]  They always kick people off things, then move back in and open it up.
[01:19:19.793 --> 01:19:30.276]  In fact, I've seen some estimates that were in the news that there may be as much as $10 billion of gold in that claim.
[01:19:30.276 --> 01:19:37.738]  And you better believe in 10 years, if they give it up, the government will then hand it over to someone that says they're doing it economically clean.
[01:19:37.738 --> 01:19:39.458]  That's how these businesses work.
[01:19:42.119 --> 01:19:50.127]  Oh, it's for the environment, where, I mean, it's just all take from you, give it to somebody else, and they're just militarizing the police to go out and carry out their orders.
[01:19:50.127 --> 01:19:53.070]  There'll be another stand down here, just like the Bundys.
[01:19:53.070 --> 01:19:56.754]  You guys really want a shooting war, don't ya?
[01:19:56.754 --> 01:19:57.695]  This never ends.
[01:19:58.985 --> 01:20:09.767]  From the producers of the multi-award-winning documentary, A Noble Lie, Oklahoma City, 1995, Free Mind Films is proud to announce the release of their third film, Shadow Ring.
[01:20:09.767 --> 01:20:23.549]  Narrated by award-winning Hollywood actor Kevin Sorbo, Shadow Ring will review the history of America's hidden oligarchy and their hidden agendas, such as the Council on Foreign Relations, the United Nations, and the Federal Reserve Bank.

[01:20:58.428 --> 01:21:04.213]  I have bought a few bottles of heart and body extract and I have to say that it certainly does work.
[01:21:04.213 --> 01:21:10.558]  That's what Jack from Michigan had to say after his experience with heart pain and what he did to treat it with heart and body extract.
[01:21:10.558 --> 01:21:12.159]  I actually had a huge heart flutter.
[01:21:12.159 --> 01:21:20.966]  I was also having some edema around my ankles and a very worrisome clot in my right leg that would happen from time to time while I was trying to sleep.
[01:21:21.306 --> 01:21:24.830]  Heart and Body Extract is all natural with no negative side effects.
[01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:29.895]  It will help repair or correct past problems associated with the heart and body circulation.
[01:21:29.895 --> 01:21:35.281]  After my second bottle of Heart and Body Extract, all problems are now gone.
[01:21:35.281 --> 01:21:37.904]  Order at HBExtract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:21:41.187 --> 01:21:46.670]  I ordered a third bottle of Heart and Body Extract for maintenance as I want to keep everything working.
[01:21:46.670 --> 01:21:54.513]  Order Heart and Body Extract at 866-295-5305 or HBextract.com.

[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:02.406]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:02.406 --> 01:22:03.026]  It's true.
[01:22:03.026 --> 01:22:07.192]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:07.192 --> 01:22:09.575]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:09.575 --> 01:22:14.061]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:14.361 --> 01:22:27.226]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.

[01:24:21.972 --> 01:24:33.174]  Paul Watson just called me minutes ago and said, hey, RefreshInfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, we've got big breaking news.
[01:24:33.174 --> 01:24:45.057]  DHS to purchase an additional 62 million rounds of AR-15 ammo, and he asked for the Feds to help him control the market and drive supply.
[01:24:46.298 --> 01:24:48.759]  Uh, do fish swim in the ocean?
[01:24:48.759 --> 01:24:51.020]  Do women like to comb their hair?
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:53.721]  Is the Easter Bunny a bunny?
[01:24:53.721 --> 01:24:57.402]  Is Hillary Clinton a lying sack of filth?
[01:24:57.402 --> 01:25:00.824]  Is Obama the son of a top communist pornographer?
[01:25:00.824 --> 01:25:06.886]  DHS to purchase 62 million rounds of AR-15 ammo.
[01:25:06.886 --> 01:25:08.046]  And then I want to change the headline.
[01:25:08.046 --> 01:25:13.348]  It's an excellent article by Paul.
[01:25:13.348 --> 01:25:14.449]  On top of the
[01:25:15.549 --> 01:25:21.770]  Three billion rounds already purchased in the last four years.
[01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:30.472]  Are we going to have a long sub-headline that says, you know, bringing the total to well over three billion rounds purchased in the last four years.
[01:25:30.472 --> 01:25:34.533]  Is this a plan to dry up the supply?
[01:25:34.533 --> 01:25:36.133]  Yes.
[01:25:36.133 --> 01:25:38.294]  He said he'll get the guns one way or another.
[01:25:38.294 --> 01:25:38.954]  He's been in the news.
[01:25:38.954 --> 01:25:43.175]  He pulled the headline up that he'll use executive power to do it.
[01:25:43.175 --> 01:25:44.395]  And I knew this was the case
[01:25:46.718 --> 01:25:47.659]  What'd you say, CJ?
[01:25:47.659 --> 01:25:49.021]  Oh, sorry, it's on Drudge.
[01:25:49.021 --> 01:25:50.242]  Oh, our story's already on Drudge?
[01:25:50.242 --> 01:25:50.743]  Yes, it is.
[01:25:50.743 --> 01:25:52.205]  Wow, Drudge is so fast.
[01:25:52.205 --> 01:25:53.607]  I mean, Drudge is quicker than I am.
[01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:56.230]  Half the time, he's got one of our stories before I'm even aware of it.
[01:25:56.230 --> 01:26:01.937]  Homeland Security purchasing 62 million rounds of AR-15 ammo.
[01:26:01.937 --> 01:26:02.738]  And there's now video.
[01:26:03.732 --> 01:26:04.492]  I want to play that.
[01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:07.954]  Homeowner shoots down drone flying over his property.
[01:26:07.954 --> 01:26:10.215]  I should just read the DrudgeReport.com every day on air.
[01:26:10.215 --> 01:26:12.636]  He's better than focusing on news than I am.
[01:26:12.636 --> 01:26:14.616]  Look at the left-hand side of Drudge.
[01:26:14.616 --> 01:26:15.737]  I mean, look at those incredible headlines.
[01:26:15.737 --> 01:26:18.938]  I've got it punched up right here.
[01:26:18.938 --> 01:26:22.180]  Europe has now indicted Google.
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:24.701]  That's going on.
[01:26:24.701 --> 01:26:30.243]  The federal tax code is longer than hundreds of Bibles.
[01:26:32.554 --> 01:26:35.735]  How many pages is it?
[01:26:35.735 --> 01:26:36.055]  74,608.
[01:26:36.055 --> 01:26:36.115]  74,608.
[01:26:36.115 --> 01:26:36.935]  Wow.
[01:26:36.935 --> 01:26:43.818]  Yeah, because for some reason, Drudge on that TV, it cuts off the edge.
[01:26:43.818 --> 01:26:50.159]  We've got to get a function where we can shrink it down a little bit, because I know he's gotten information corner to corner.
[01:26:50.159 --> 01:26:54.901]  Unlike InfoWars, it looks like somebody shot it with a shotgun full of ads.
[01:26:54.901 --> 01:26:57.122]  But we are redesigning InfoWars.
[01:26:57.122 --> 01:26:57.922]  I'm sorry, what were you saying?
[01:26:58.570 --> 01:27:06.357]  I was saying, Drudge doesn't format correctly in new browsers, so when you zoom or decrease, it's still on the same side of the screen.
[01:27:06.357 --> 01:27:10.701]  I kind of like that though, because it's just, it's so original and it doesn't change.
[01:27:10.701 --> 01:27:13.664]  It just gets better.
[01:27:13.664 --> 01:27:14.905]  So here is that story.
[01:27:14.905 --> 01:27:19.589]  DH has to purchase 62 million rounds of AR-15 ammo.
[01:27:19.589 --> 01:27:21.071]  And yes, they're trying to drop the supply.
[01:27:21.071 --> 01:27:22.152]  This is on top.
[01:27:23.410 --> 01:27:29.255]  Everybody keeps using the 2.6 billion number from like three years ago.
[01:27:29.255 --> 01:27:32.037]  I've been adding it up and maybe Kit Daniels is really good at this.
[01:27:32.037 --> 01:27:33.478]  He really stays on this.
[01:27:33.478 --> 01:27:43.926]  Kit, can you maybe update his article and say updated by Kit Daniels at the bottom or something and try to add up from all the articles we've done on the federal purchase orders?
[01:27:44.827 --> 01:28:10.584]  A guesstimation, because I don't claim it'll be exact, there's so many orders we don't even know about, but it was 2.6 a couple years ago, I think two and a half years ago, three years ago, and then there's just hundreds of millions getting bought all the time, like 20 million here, 40 million there, 1 million there, 8 million there, 70 million here, 99 million here, 150 million here, and we knew it was about the ammo when it was like
[01:28:12.429 --> 01:28:15.012]  Millions of rounds of ammo that they don't use.
[01:28:15.012 --> 01:28:16.313]  30-odd-six.
[01:28:16.313 --> 01:28:16.334]  243.
[01:28:16.334 --> 01:28:19.017]  38 special.
[01:28:24.568 --> 01:28:26.188]  They don't use those rounds in the U.S.
[01:28:26.188 --> 01:28:27.009]  military.
[01:28:27.009 --> 01:28:37.831]  They use .223, .308, .50 caliber BMG, what is it, .50 caliber, the little short ones, what do they call it, I can't remember anymore, APC, I forget all the names.
[01:28:37.831 --> 01:28:40.571]  I mean, there's probably only 10 rounds they use in the U.S.
[01:28:40.571 --> 01:28:41.331]  military.
[01:28:41.331 --> 01:28:42.272]  There's a good reason for that.
[01:28:42.272 --> 01:28:44.472]  You don't want to have a whole bunch of different rounds.
[01:28:44.472 --> 01:28:48.013]  It's very simple what's used.
[01:28:48.013 --> 01:28:53.514]  They are buying, I mean, that's one article, was it Kitteritz, Don Salazar did one, I remember one last year where it was just like,
[01:28:54.927 --> 01:28:56.128]  Hundreds of cartridges.
[01:28:56.128 --> 01:29:01.932]  They were buying up like 44 Long Colt.
[01:29:01.932 --> 01:29:03.233]  That you can hardly even order.
[01:29:03.233 --> 01:29:04.514]  I've got a 44 Long Colt.
[01:29:04.514 --> 01:29:06.356]  It's an amazing rifle.
[01:29:06.356 --> 01:29:07.536]  Great for shooting wild hogs.
[01:29:07.536 --> 01:29:09.198]  Just throw it right in the back of your truck.
[01:29:09.198 --> 01:29:09.918]  Small rifle.
[01:29:09.918 --> 01:29:10.759]  Super high powered.
[01:29:10.759 --> 01:29:13.161]  44 Long Colt.
[01:29:13.161 --> 01:29:16.223]  Most people shoot the 44 Colt, which is still long.
[01:29:16.223 --> 01:29:17.504]  It's not Long Colt.
[01:29:17.504 --> 01:29:20.126]  You gotta shoot Long Colt in those rifles.
[01:29:20.126 --> 01:29:21.387]  But they're buying Long Colt.
[01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:25.840]  They're basically buying everything up.
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:27.141]  This story is big.
[01:29:27.141 --> 01:29:30.124]  I want to go out and shoot my Long Colt.
[01:29:30.124 --> 01:29:33.107]  I want to go out and shoot my Barretts.
[01:29:33.107 --> 01:29:34.648]  But mainly I want to go out and shoot my .223s.
[01:29:34.648 --> 01:29:42.996]  I just... I didn't used to be a big fan of .223s back, you know, 25 years ago when I would shoot AR-15s, but they've really perfected them now.
[01:29:42.996 --> 01:29:44.157]  I just love the .223.
[01:29:44.157 --> 01:29:46.139]  It's like a laser beam.
[01:29:46.139 --> 01:29:46.560]  Loving this.
[01:29:47.748 --> 01:29:51.671]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.671 --> 01:29:54.333]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.982 --> 01:30:01.303]  Do you know what it means to be an American?
[01:30:01.303 --> 01:30:02.783]  It's more than a flag.
[01:30:02.783 --> 01:30:05.645]  It's more than knowing the star-spangled banner.
[01:30:05.645 --> 01:30:07.225]  It's knowing the Constitution.
[01:30:07.225 --> 01:30:10.326]  It's understanding those rights and fighting for them.
[01:30:10.326 --> 01:30:13.628]  Our country's falling apart because people have forgotten to fight.
[01:30:13.628 --> 01:30:17.129]  To stand up in the face of tyranny and do the right thing.
[01:30:17.129 --> 01:30:19.610]  It's putting your life on the line to protect your country.
[01:30:19.770 --> 01:30:22.252]  from enemies both foreign and domestic.
[01:30:22.252 --> 01:30:30.457]  The Bill of Rights is what the people are entitled to against every government and no government should refuse or rest on inference.
[01:30:30.457 --> 01:30:35.441]  So the Tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[01:30:36.261 --> 01:30:41.184]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com, and I believe our flag is more than cloth and ink.
[01:30:41.184 --> 01:30:43.906]  It is a symbol that stands for liberty and freedom.
[01:30:43.906 --> 01:30:49.409]  It is the history of our nation, and it's marked by the blood of those who died defending it.

[01:30:51.150 --> 01:30:55.613]  Turn off your TV, put your Cheetos down, get off your butt and join the resistance.
[01:30:58.935 --> 01:31:00.897]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:31:00.897 --> 01:31:05.120]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:09.603]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:31:09.603 --> 01:31:16.889]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:31:16.889 --> 01:31:23.174]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and eye
[01:31:23.234 --> 01:31:26.175]  Optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:26.175 --> 01:31:28.375]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[01:31:28.375 --> 01:31:29.616]  DNA Force.
[01:31:29.616 --> 01:31:31.736]  Just one of the key compounds.
[01:31:31.736 --> 01:31:39.318]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed listed published studies.
[01:31:39.318 --> 01:31:41.899]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:31:58.749 --> 01:32:03.893]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:32:03.893 --> 01:32:10.018]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:32:10.018 --> 01:32:14.802]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:32:14.802 --> 01:32:18.365]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:32:18.365 --> 01:32:20.347]  No needles, no injections.

[01:32:28.633 --> 01:32:29.654]  Alex Jones here.
[01:32:29.654 --> 01:32:38.920]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:42.723]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:51.069]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[01:32:51.069 --> 01:32:53.431]  Visit Infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:32:53.431 --> 01:32:54.451]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:33:12.988 --> 01:33:24.497]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.497 --> 01:33:33.965]  Sometimes there's a video, a photo, a statement, an image, that no matter what the social engineers try to do with their PR stunts, the public sees through.
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:49.413]  Ryan Williams saying that, oh, he was shot down in a helicopter, you never forget the missile shooting up and exploding and the smell of it and everything, and then, oh, actually I was ten minutes behind, an hour behind, two hours behind, actually I was nowhere around it, I just misremembered it, and now he's made up a bunch of other stuff.
[01:33:49.413 --> 01:33:57.560]  Hillary Clinton saying she was shot at and attacked in the air and on the airfield in Bosnia with CBS News, they show the footage, none of it happened.
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:01.284]  It's those simple lies that people can wrap their minds around.
[01:34:02.987 --> 01:34:12.109]  And the image of a armored tank pulling a citizen over and then getting in their face and saying, stand right there!
[01:34:12.109 --> 01:34:14.910]  That tells not a thousand words, but a million words.
[01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:20.331]  And we're going to talk to Lucas Jewell, who I think has been on the show before, back when he worked with Adam Kokesh.
[01:34:20.331 --> 01:34:26.452]  He's a former Navy air traffic controller who woke up in the military and got out of his consciousness as an objector.
[01:34:26.452 --> 01:34:30.093]  He went on to manage libertarian activist Adam Kokesh's operation for a while.
[01:34:31.736 --> 01:34:34.477]  And he has joined us before.
[01:34:34.477 --> 01:34:38.098]  He's running for city commission in Gainesville, Florida, unsuccessfully.
[01:34:38.098 --> 01:34:41.320]  And is a student majoring in economics at Santa Fe College.
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:45.201]  Facebook J-V-I-L-L-E.
[01:34:45.201 --> 01:34:45.701]  J-Vile.
[01:34:45.701 --> 01:34:53.824]  And we're going to be talking to him in a moment about getting pulled over by the tank and roll some of that video and describe it for the audience.
[01:34:53.824 --> 01:34:54.425]  Oh, by the way,
[01:34:56.104 --> 01:35:07.326]  The story up on InfoWars.com and now up on DrudgeReport.com is dealing with another 62 million rounds.
[01:35:07.326 --> 01:35:10.107]  And I'm going to be honest, I don't know what the number is now.
[01:35:10.107 --> 01:35:20.969]  About a year ago, Kit Daniels added it up and it was over 3 billion rounds have been purchased in the last four years by Homeland Security, including the illegal types under NATO that are Holopoint.
[01:35:20.969 --> 01:35:21.749]  That's just the law.
[01:35:21.749 --> 01:35:23.290]  It's the Geneva Convention.
[01:35:23.290 --> 01:35:25.070]  They're anti-personnel rounds.
[01:35:26.288 --> 01:35:28.089]  Because they hurt people too bad they're banned.
[01:35:28.089 --> 01:35:29.529]  I mean, that just shows how silly it all is.
[01:35:29.529 --> 01:35:31.329]  The point is, they're buying illegal ammo.
[01:35:31.329 --> 01:35:32.590]  It's for us.
[01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:35.311]  They got the targets of the Patriots.
[01:35:35.311 --> 01:35:36.311]  The training is for it.
[01:35:36.311 --> 01:35:38.251]  The manuals are for it.
[01:35:38.251 --> 01:35:43.313]  The drill out in California over the weekend that we were banned from, it was sovereign citizen gun owners, veterans.
[01:35:43.313 --> 01:35:44.333]  They were practicing attacking.
[01:35:44.333 --> 01:35:45.053]  We have it on video.
[01:35:45.053 --> 01:35:46.154]  We played it yesterday.
[01:35:47.799 --> 01:35:59.525]  While we have ISIS bases five miles over the border of El Paso, Judicial Watch reporting on, our reporters are down there reporting on it as well.
[01:35:59.525 --> 01:36:05.269]  We're here bracing for the government basically declaring us to be the open enemy.
[01:36:05.269 --> 01:36:08.110]  And they've bought up not just the 45
[01:36:12.330 --> 01:36:24.440]  Ammo for your Colt 911s that the military still has sometimes, and the Berettas they have with the 9mm, and the .223, and the .308, and the .50 cal BMG, and all the rest of it.
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:29.924]  They're buying up hundreds of other different exotic cartridges.
[01:36:29.924 --> 01:36:36.670]  We're going to be breaking that down more, and we'll also get Lucas Jules' take on that in just a moment.
[01:36:36.670 --> 01:36:40.973]  I've got my little decorative 100 year anniversary Colt 911 right here.
[01:36:43.194 --> 01:36:51.636]  And again, we bring guns out on the show sometimes because it's our American and free human birthright to not be disarmed slaves.
[01:36:51.636 --> 01:36:53.656]  You can go back to 300 and Greece to understand that.
[01:36:53.656 --> 01:36:56.037]  That's what Jakari Jackson put on earlier.
[01:36:56.037 --> 01:37:00.638]  It's the fact that you shouldn't be scared of a citizen with a firearm.
[01:37:00.638 --> 01:37:04.078]  You shouldn't be scared of the image of a free man or woman with a gun.
[01:37:04.078 --> 01:37:06.639]  I mean, where are the feminist groups saying arm women?
[01:37:07.435 --> 01:37:13.258]  And I'm not usually into fancy dandy guns, pearl-handled guns, but, you know, you gotta celebrate a Colt 911.
[01:37:13.258 --> 01:37:20.661]  You gotta pay your tithes to the gun manufacturer, Colt, or the enemy will take this company down.
[01:37:20.661 --> 01:37:22.402]  They are suing them, of course.
[01:37:22.402 --> 01:37:26.504]  So, you shop with the good guys, you vote with your dollars.
[01:37:26.504 --> 01:37:34.828]  And if you got the money, this is as sweet shooting .45 as it gets.
[01:37:34.828 --> 01:37:36.369]  So good and sweet.
[01:37:37.698 --> 01:37:39.461]  Loving little firearm.
[01:37:39.461 --> 01:37:44.087]  Such a nice little super shock hollow point round.
[01:37:44.087 --> 01:37:50.336]  Before some anti-gunner sends me an email, it's illegal to use in warfare hollow point.
[01:37:50.336 --> 01:37:52.218]  It's not illegal for citizens to have them in self-defense.
[01:37:53.886 --> 01:37:57.850]  Okay, let's continue now here.
[01:37:57.850 --> 01:37:59.571]  Another report on Infowars.com.
[01:37:59.571 --> 01:38:04.155]  Hillary hasn't driven a car since 1996 to show how disconnected from reality.
[01:38:04.155 --> 01:38:05.536]  I wonder if she's driven in a tank.
[01:38:05.536 --> 01:38:18.187]  Well, yeah, we know that presidential vehicles pretty much are tanks on wheels and we know that the thousands of NRAPs that they promised were just for terrorists are now being used at checkpoints on the highways to intimidate the public.
[01:38:18.187 --> 01:38:20.069]  We'll be talking about that, as I said, in a moment.
[01:38:20.069 --> 01:38:21.250]  But first off, briefly,
[01:38:22.571 --> 01:38:28.195]  We're running a special on fluoride shield that is basically a chelator.
[01:38:28.195 --> 01:38:33.879]  It's got... I think you guys have that door open.
[01:38:33.879 --> 01:38:38.222]  Just a little update.
[01:38:38.222 --> 01:38:41.425]  It's got, what is it, five ingredients.
[01:38:41.425 --> 01:38:45.908]  It's got the nation iodine, but four other ingredients that are known to pull toxins out of the body.
[01:38:47.293 --> 01:38:49.395]  And it's something that I take on a daily basis.
[01:38:49.395 --> 01:38:51.537]  You can get a free bottle of it.
[01:38:51.537 --> 01:38:56.763]  That is a huge value.
[01:38:56.763 --> 01:39:03.970]  Absolutely free when you get it with two bottles of Survival Shield X2 that are already discounted right now with free shipping.
[01:39:03.970 --> 01:39:04.831]  So that's a win-win.
[01:39:04.831 --> 01:39:05.531]  A free bottle.
[01:39:06.581 --> 01:39:14.184]  That is a $29.95 value with the two bottles of Survival Shield X2 and free shipping, and that is while supplies last.
[01:39:14.184 --> 01:39:19.286]  We are set to sell out of Fluoride Shield, and I like to do the opposite of what other folks do.
[01:39:19.286 --> 01:39:25.488]  When we're about to sell out of something and we don't have it for a while, I discount it instead of jacking up the price on it, which is what I guess a lot of folks would do.
[01:39:25.488 --> 01:39:26.889]  I just do counterintuitive things.
[01:39:26.889 --> 01:39:29.470]  It seems to work, by the grace of God.
[01:39:29.470 --> 01:39:33.831]  So you can get a discount on that before it sells out.
[01:39:33.831 --> 01:39:34.652]  Info Wars.
[01:39:35.925 --> 01:39:37.986]  Life.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:39:37.986 --> 01:39:50.013]  And one other special we're running at Infowarslife.com, with the free shipping, is the products I took for 45 days religiously, because I'll admit it, I forget all the time to take it.
[01:39:50.013 --> 01:40:02.261]  So I even had a reminder on my iPhone, I had the crew telling me to do it, to every day remember, at least twice a day, to take, well the OxyPower only did it for like six days of that period, but the others I took, you do that once a month, the others I took,
[01:40:03.021 --> 01:40:07.503]  Every single day, the Supramel Vitality and the Survival Shield Niacin Iodine X2.
[01:40:07.503 --> 01:40:10.305]  We have these huge iodine deficiencies and it's the good allergen.
[01:40:10.305 --> 01:40:14.667]  If you don't know the reason to get it, just go watch the informational videos at Infowarslife.com.
[01:40:14.667 --> 01:40:16.167]  It's really a missing link.
[01:40:16.167 --> 01:40:17.368]  It's so important.
[01:40:17.368 --> 01:40:23.951]  And finally doing that, it's just dramatic energy, libido, weight loss, muscle gain.
[01:40:23.951 --> 01:40:25.132]  You've seen it on the show.
[01:40:25.132 --> 01:40:26.933]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:40:32.481 --> 01:40:45.934]  And lastly, it is important to remember, just as I said with the Second Amendment, to vote with your dollars and to support the broadcast.
[01:40:45.934 --> 01:40:48.676]  Because that's how we get the word out is free will.
[01:40:48.676 --> 01:40:56.964]  We're not here like the IRS today with a gun to your head, taking your money to then give it to George Soros to give it to the media to try to demonize the American people.
[01:40:57.878 --> 01:41:10.088]  We're here fighting the onslaught, globalist takeover of America, and if we just get people to realize how huge this takeover is, and what amazing times we're alive in, it's game over for the globalists.
[01:41:10.088 --> 01:41:18.394]  So we have to get out of our comfort zones, and we have to really take action.
[01:41:18.394 --> 01:41:22.658]  I think the answer for our guest
[01:41:27.205 --> 01:41:42.176]  I think the answer is to do things like go to the public events they're going to have with the MRAP to condition the public to accept it and nicely interview these cops and say, you know, you threatened me to get in front of my car.
[01:41:42.176 --> 01:41:43.437]  You were going to arrest me.
[01:41:43.437 --> 01:41:46.559]  Do you enjoy being on a petty power trip?
[01:41:46.559 --> 01:41:49.801]  And do you understand that you're going to have your rights violated by the system as well?
[01:41:49.801 --> 01:41:51.762]  I would have events.
[01:41:52.825 --> 01:42:03.376]  A public education event, I would, you know, get the local city park, and not even call it a demonstration, but call it an educational event about community policing.
[01:42:03.376 --> 01:42:13.947]  See, zig when they zag, and then actually reach out to the police and the public and talk about why they're being given these caches of weapons, why is the government buying millions of rounds of ammo.
[01:42:15.290 --> 01:42:16.591]  It was 3 billion a couple years ago.
[01:42:16.591 --> 01:42:23.616]  I mean, we've got to add it all up as best we can, and explain it as best we can, and just link to the different purchases.
[01:42:23.616 --> 01:42:29.039]  It'll be far bigger than what we say, but they would get up and say, we didn't buy 1 million rounds, we didn't buy a million rounds.
[01:42:29.039 --> 01:42:33.842]  It's always, we didn't buy, we didn't buy, as they arm and train to take on the American people and admit it.
[01:42:33.842 --> 01:42:43.249]  So we have to have a discussion about this, and there is a discussion about the fake drug war, and about the militarization of police, and about the surveillance grid, and how the DEA is caught dealing the drugs.
[01:42:43.249 --> 01:42:44.850]  We just continue to do that, but realize
[01:42:45.630 --> 01:42:48.271]  They're compartmentalized in all these agencies.
[01:42:48.271 --> 01:42:49.192]  They're not all bad.
[01:42:49.192 --> 01:42:53.114]  A lot of them are good and are some of the most awake people out there.
[01:42:53.114 --> 01:42:57.536]  And so the system just hopes we attack the government itself.
[01:42:57.536 --> 01:43:00.777]  Here's an analogy that I'm going to my guest.
[01:43:00.777 --> 01:43:06.440]  There are many cases in history where an Islamist radical would hijack a plane or others, criminals sometimes,
[01:43:07.762 --> 01:43:14.227]  And they found that if they tied up the pilots, or made them fly for them, made them take their jackets off, they would put them on.
[01:43:14.227 --> 01:43:16.489]  Sometimes they wouldn't even button right.
[01:43:16.489 --> 01:43:22.534]  And that suddenly, if the hijackers were wearing official uniforms, everyone would start doing what they said more.
[01:43:23.294 --> 01:43:26.496]  That's the authority at a primitive level of a uniform.
[01:43:26.496 --> 01:43:32.619]  We recognize as humans, going back, that that's a warrior, that's the chief, and it's just archetypal programmed into us.
[01:43:32.619 --> 01:43:38.122]  Because back then, the warriors and the chief, if you're a little band of 100 people, they almost always really were on your side.
[01:43:38.122 --> 01:43:39.443]  It was about barely surviving.
[01:43:39.443 --> 01:43:41.284]  It was all big family things.
[01:43:41.284 --> 01:43:45.546]  So we see somebody in a uniform as like our daddy, basically.
[01:43:45.546 --> 01:43:47.067]  And they didn't always put the uniform on.
[01:43:47.067 --> 01:43:49.168]  You put a uniform on, it was to go to war.
[01:43:50.333 --> 01:43:55.835]  Because another tribe of a thousand people was coming down the river, burning everybody out, killing the men and taking the women.
[01:43:55.835 --> 01:44:00.817]  And so you've made the decision to get ready to fight.
[01:44:00.817 --> 01:44:04.258]  Now, are you going to question the warriors and their uniforms?
[01:44:04.258 --> 01:44:04.879]  No, you're not.
[01:44:04.879 --> 01:44:08.320]  Your body's designed to gear up and do what they say.
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:12.242]  So this is all the conditioning that's going on.
[01:44:12.242 --> 01:44:13.082]  But DHS
[01:44:15.489 --> 01:44:21.974]  To now get 62 million more rounds of the AR-15 ammo to drive up the price but also to hoard it for a civil war.
[01:44:21.974 --> 01:44:25.696]  And that's what every indicator shows they're doing, and the Globalists are bold enough to try it.
[01:44:25.696 --> 01:44:29.379]  I hope to expose it, cause an actual debate about it, so they have to back off.
[01:44:29.379 --> 01:44:33.322]  Alright, Facebook.com forward slash J-V-I-L-L-E.
[01:44:33.322 --> 01:44:36.704]  Lucas Jewell, Naval veteran, joins us while he's talking.
[01:44:36.704 --> 01:44:42.268]  We'll roll in the background some of the video, and then cue it up to where the cop, you know, says, get over there or I'm gonna arrest you!
[01:44:44.109 --> 01:44:44.990]  You flipped them off.
[01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:46.050]  I probably wouldn't have done that.
[01:44:46.050 --> 01:44:53.095]  I'd have pulled over and confronted them nicely about, you know, what are you out here to do to condition the public to your armored vehicle?
[01:44:53.095 --> 01:44:56.997]  And, you know, I understand society's teetering on the edge of collapse, but, you know, that was done by design.
[01:44:56.997 --> 01:45:01.499]  You know, I would simply give them films and books because I found it's more effective.
[01:45:01.499 --> 01:45:03.821]  But I'm not, hey, it's your First Amendment to flip them off.
[01:45:04.201 --> 01:45:08.164]  And I get it, you're mad, we're being overrun, it's a standing army, I get it.
[01:45:08.164 --> 01:45:13.647]  So I can almost admire, you know, at one level the fact that you're bold.
[01:45:13.647 --> 01:45:15.749]  So, Lucas, Jewel, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:18.321]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[01:45:18.321 --> 01:45:27.485]  And while I can certainly agree that what I did was impolite, I would say, you know, the government has done some very impolite things to me also.
[01:45:27.485 --> 01:45:28.005]  Exactly.
[01:45:28.005 --> 01:45:29.366]  So, I mean, it's true.
[01:45:29.366 --> 01:45:31.947]  We're lining up for a war in this country.
[01:45:31.947 --> 01:45:34.168]  I'm trying to stop it, but I mean, I get your anger.
[01:45:34.168 --> 01:45:35.229]  So describe what happened.
[01:45:36.616 --> 01:45:49.783]  Well, I was driving down University Avenue here in Gainesville, Florida, right in front of the University of Florida, and I see an armed personnel carrier with a bunch of guys dressed up like G.I.
[01:45:49.783 --> 01:46:04.371]  Joes in the back of a Kevlar, and I see this driving beside me on University Avenue, and I have a lot of issues with the police state and police militarization, so I just wanted to express my negative feelings
[01:46:16.489 --> 01:46:23.672]  Well, I could say I've been flipped off by the Marines and Secret Service covering Bilderberg, and I didn't flip them off, so, you know, they weren't harassed.
[01:46:23.672 --> 01:46:30.096]  I mean, so, you know, that's the First Amendment, you know, to say they don't like me for whatever brainwashed reason, but, so what happened next?
[01:46:30.096 --> 01:46:30.476]  Break it down.
[01:46:31.822 --> 01:46:49.952]  So they proceeded to follow me in this armored vehicle for about two miles, and then I turned onto another road, and that's when they turned behind me and turned on the red and blue flashing lights that were on the top of this vehicle.
[01:46:49.952 --> 01:46:54.054]  Soon after, I'm pulled out of the vehicle.
[01:46:54.054 --> 01:46:55.595]  I'm assaulted by an officer.
[01:46:57.101 --> 01:47:05.087]  Uh, you know, one officer says I'm not allowed to film him because my phone might be a gun, which is completely ludicrous.
[01:47:05.087 --> 01:47:17.876]  Uh, and if you watch the video, the officer who tells me that I can't point my camera at him because it might be a gun, he eventually says that I can point the camera at myself, I just can't point the camera at him.
[01:47:17.876 --> 01:47:24.361]  Uh, so if he really was afraid that my camera was a weapon, uh, why would he want me to still hold it?
[01:47:25.370 --> 01:47:33.277]  Well, that's an unlawful order, and they're in a public place, and so until you're under actual arrest, you can't turn the camera off.
[01:47:33.277 --> 01:47:34.778]  Right.
[01:47:34.778 --> 01:47:37.720]  And I didn't turn the camera off.
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:53.533]  You know, they were wearing Kevlar, they were wearing the same camouflage the United States Marine Corps wears, and they really, I feel like, took on the attitude of those uniforms.
[01:47:54.949 --> 01:48:06.172]  They dressed up playing soldier and so they finally got someone who they could bully and they tried to bully me.
[01:48:06.172 --> 01:48:09.133]  Well, I didn't know that they'd assault you and said that you couldn't film.
[01:48:09.133 --> 01:48:11.993]  I just seen the part of them threatening to arrest you and pulling you over.
[01:48:11.993 --> 01:48:13.514]  I guess the full video is on your website.
[01:48:13.514 --> 01:48:15.134]  We're now rolling it now.
[01:48:15.134 --> 01:48:17.595]  Describe the assault.
[01:48:17.595 --> 01:48:21.956]  Well, the officer tells me to stand in between the headlights
[01:48:23.067 --> 01:48:24.748]  And hand him my driver's license.
[01:48:24.748 --> 01:48:27.408]  So he gives me two orders at once.
[01:48:27.408 --> 01:48:45.754]  I hand him my driver's license and I'm walking towards the headlights and he tells me again to stand in front of the headlights and you can see in the video I'm moving towards the headlights and that's when he assaults me and says you know he's gonna arrest me for resisting or something like that.
[01:48:45.754 --> 01:48:47.695]  We'll play that clip in a moment.
[01:48:47.695 --> 01:48:50.216]  That's where I think these officers really
[01:48:51.488 --> 01:48:53.389]  Do show themselves to be wannabe G.I.
[01:48:53.389 --> 01:48:54.169]  Joes.
[01:48:54.169 --> 01:48:58.551]  They think you're an Al-Qaeda operative inside Fallujah.
[01:48:58.551 --> 01:49:03.773]  As they pull you over, they should have just let you flip them off and been, you know, bigger men about it.
[01:49:03.773 --> 01:49:06.715]  And then they grab on you and threaten to arrest you.
[01:49:07.935 --> 01:49:10.097]  You can be seen to be doing what he says.
[01:49:10.097 --> 01:49:11.138]  He's playing games with you.
[01:49:11.138 --> 01:49:14.500]  And it's all about, he wants you to know that he's your boss.
[01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:18.003]  Well, that's not how free countries work.
[01:49:18.003 --> 01:49:21.686]  And so, if you want to put on a uniform, you're agreeing to take a lot of crap.
[01:49:21.686 --> 01:49:24.549]  So don't get into the uniform and then be on a pity party all day.
[01:49:25.683 --> 01:49:31.586]  Somebody flips you off and then go and abuse them verbally and the rest of it for that.
[01:49:31.586 --> 01:49:34.147]  But hey, the good news is your story is a national story.
[01:49:34.147 --> 01:49:36.509]  It's all over newspapers everywhere being played on the news.
[01:49:36.509 --> 01:49:40.691]  Man pulled over by tank and people are really understanding this is a fraud.
[01:49:40.691 --> 01:49:43.953]  So the good news is it's turned out to be good.
[01:49:43.953 --> 01:49:48.595]  Yeah, you know, I think this has been very good and on multiple fronts.
[01:49:49.481 --> 01:50:00.349]  One, everyone should know that we do have the right of expression and we can express ourselves even in ways that are unpleasant, such as extending your middle finger.
[01:50:00.349 --> 01:50:04.251]  So, I hope that people realize that we're allowed to do that.
[01:50:04.251 --> 01:50:09.475]  And also, I hope this facilitates the debate about police militarization.
[01:50:10.234 --> 01:50:12.936]  Well I hope that happens and of course I can have my opinion too.
[01:50:12.936 --> 01:50:14.978]  I don't think flipping police off is a good idea.
[01:50:14.978 --> 01:50:18.020]  A lot of them understand the First Amendment, a lot of them don't.
[01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:20.522]  I mean just like I wouldn't flip off random men.
[01:50:20.522 --> 01:50:23.525]  You can get in a fight real quick doing that.
[01:50:23.525 --> 01:50:24.665]  But I understand.
[01:50:24.665 --> 01:50:25.426]  You can do what you want.
[01:50:27.657 --> 01:50:28.498]  You have a First Amendment.
[01:50:28.498 --> 01:50:29.799]  I'm just saying I don't think it's a good idea.
[01:50:29.799 --> 01:50:35.863]  I want to play the clip you're talking about as we go to break and come back, get some final comments from you, and talk about some of the journalism you're involved in.
[01:50:35.863 --> 01:50:37.505]  You've done a lot of great work.
[01:50:37.505 --> 01:50:41.308]  Let's go ahead and play that clip of him threatening him.
[01:50:41.308 --> 01:50:43.890]  Mr. Jewell, please stand between the headlights.
[01:50:43.890 --> 01:50:47.933]  I'm getting- Stand between the headlights where I told you to.
[01:50:47.933 --> 01:50:52.256]  If I have to ask you again, you will be put in handcuffs and arrested for resisting.
[01:50:52.256 --> 01:50:53.317]  Do you understand me?
[01:50:53.317 --> 01:50:53.898]  Look at me.
[01:50:53.898 --> 01:50:55.099]  Do you understand me?
[01:50:55.099 --> 01:50:56.139]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:56.139 --> 01:50:56.620]  Stay with us.
[01:50:59.121 --> 01:51:03.225]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:03.225 --> 01:51:06.409]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:06.409 --> 01:51:08.050]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:08.050 --> 01:51:11.394]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:11.394 --> 01:51:12.895]  Infidel Body Armor.

[01:51:30.262 --> 01:51:31.242]  Hey, Boomer!
[01:51:31.242 --> 01:51:34.703]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[01:51:34.703 --> 01:51:36.364]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[01:51:36.364 --> 01:51:38.304]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[01:51:38.304 --> 01:51:44.146]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[01:51:44.146 --> 01:51:44.986]  I know, right?
[01:51:44.986 --> 01:51:46.307]  You love it, too!
[01:51:46.307 --> 01:51:47.747]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[01:51:47.747 --> 01:51:48.767]  Let's go get some!

[01:51:59.190 --> 01:52:02.804]  Why use dial-up when you can use broadband?
[01:52:02.804 --> 01:52:03.808]  Why travel with this?
[01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:06.710]  When you can use this.
[01:52:06.710 --> 01:52:12.692]  And why would anyone use colloidal or ionic silver when you can use supernatural silver?
[01:52:12.692 --> 01:52:19.913]  Supernatural silver is state-of-the-art and it's been clinically proven to be several hundred times more effective than those other silvers.
[01:52:19.913 --> 01:52:25.854]  It's powerful enough to protect you and your family from the threat of deadly viruses, bacteria and fungus.
[01:52:25.854 --> 01:52:29.095]  But it's so safe that it can be used internally or topically.
[01:52:29.575 --> 01:52:34.279]  And you'll never again deal with the nasty side effects of harsh drugs or antibiotics.
[01:52:34.279 --> 01:52:44.467]  Hundreds of scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals, and research institutions have all shown supernatural silver is a powerful weapon in the fight against invading pathogens.
[01:52:44.787 --> 01:52:48.009]  Supernatural Silver is a must-have for your arsenal.

[01:52:59.237 --> 01:53:00.338]  Usually the older one gets...
[01:53:00.618 --> 01:53:05.983]  The less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[01:53:05.983 --> 01:53:10.366]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[01:53:10.366 --> 01:53:13.869]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[01:53:13.869 --> 01:53:15.010]  Not fun!
[01:53:15.010 --> 01:53:23.418]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[01:53:23.418 --> 01:53:28.182]  One World Whey is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[01:53:28.502 --> 01:53:29.663]  My name is Errol.
[01:53:29.663 --> 01:53:31.184]  I'm 74 years old.
[01:53:31.184 --> 01:53:33.765]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[01:53:33.765 --> 01:53:41.629]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your trace mineral supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[01:53:41.629 --> 01:53:47.933]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[01:53:47.933 --> 01:53:48.413]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:53:48.413 --> 01:53:48.613]  That's 888-988-3325.

[01:54:00.352 --> 01:54:13.879]  That's an armored vehicle, that's not a tank.
[01:54:13.879 --> 01:54:15.780]  You're telling me this isn't a tank?
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:16.781]  You were in the Navy?
[01:54:16.781 --> 01:54:17.521]  Yeah.
[01:54:17.521 --> 01:54:19.142]  And you think that's a tank?
[01:54:19.142 --> 01:54:21.324]  You're telling me that something like this doesn't go to Iraq?
[01:54:21.324 --> 01:54:23.565]  Film after your video, you think that's a tank?
[01:54:23.565 --> 01:54:25.306]  You're telling me that this right here
[01:54:27.626 --> 01:54:29.950]  He told me to do that.
[01:54:32.489 --> 01:54:33.469]  It's called a what?
[01:54:33.469 --> 01:54:34.349]  Armored Personnel Carrier.
[01:54:34.349 --> 01:54:35.269]  I'm going to tell you what.
[01:54:35.269 --> 01:54:36.850]  It's basically a tank!
[01:54:36.850 --> 01:54:44.251]  I don't mind you recording that, but you're not going to point it at me, because there are firearms that are made out of devices like that.
[01:54:44.251 --> 01:54:48.432]  So if you want to film all of us, I don't mind that, but we'll set your camera up where it can film all of us.
[01:54:48.432 --> 01:54:49.072]  Yes, sir.
[01:54:49.072 --> 01:54:49.772]  All right?
[01:54:49.772 --> 01:54:51.312]  You want to set it right here?
[01:54:51.312 --> 01:54:54.033]  It'll face this way where we're all talking.
[01:54:54.033 --> 01:54:55.553]  Can I just point it at me?
[01:54:55.553 --> 01:54:56.053]  That's fine.
[01:54:56.053 --> 01:54:56.453]  Okay.
[01:54:56.453 --> 01:55:00.734]  You're not going to point it at me, but that's the secret.
[01:55:00.734 --> 01:55:00.854]  Okay.
[01:55:00.854 --> 01:55:01.254]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:02.620 --> 01:55:08.385]  He never says sir to you because he doesn't respect the American people.
[01:55:08.385 --> 01:55:11.868]  The cop doesn't say sir to me, I don't say sir to them.
[01:55:11.868 --> 01:55:13.569]  It disgraces this whole country.
[01:55:13.569 --> 01:55:17.493]  You know, I love that cop sitting there saying, don't point your phone at me.
[01:55:17.493 --> 01:55:19.134]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:55:19.134 --> 01:55:21.896]  Yeah, they got guns hidden in boots.
[01:55:21.896 --> 01:55:26.040]  It'd be like a cop saying, don't aim your boot tips towards me, there could be a gun in there.
[01:55:27.984 --> 01:55:32.347]  And of course, when he first pulls him over, it's on the tape, he goes, uh, why'd you pull him over in a tank?
[01:55:32.347 --> 01:55:34.088]  He goes, yeah, I did pull you over in a tank.
[01:55:34.088 --> 01:55:36.210]  He's playing these games like we're the bosses.
[01:55:36.210 --> 01:55:38.572]  No, let me tell you who the bosses are.
[01:55:38.572 --> 01:55:40.693]  It's the globalists that put fluoride in your water, cop.
[01:55:40.693 --> 01:55:42.434]  It's going to brain damage your kids.
[01:55:42.434 --> 01:55:47.878]  It's the globalists that put the stimulants and adjuvants and cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[01:55:47.878 --> 01:55:51.781]  You better look into it because we care about you and your family.
[01:55:51.781 --> 01:55:54.923]  It's the globalists devaluing the currency and destroying the country right now.
[01:55:54.923 --> 01:55:56.705]  Have you seen the lawlessness going on right now?
[01:55:58.063 --> 01:56:01.384]  This is part of a larger plan to take this country down.
[01:56:01.384 --> 01:56:14.586]  And that just shows that the criminal elite want to just have tanks sitting around our armored vehicles with about five or six guys in camo to come up and bug their eyes out at somebody.
[01:56:14.586 --> 01:56:16.227]  It's just pathetic.
[01:56:16.227 --> 01:56:21.288]  But let me tell you, a lot of these guys, when a real civil war starts, are going to desert these police units.
[01:56:21.288 --> 01:56:23.628]  They don't want to have a real war.
[01:56:23.628 --> 01:56:27.049]  And once you take those George Soros orders and start the gun confiscation,
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:30.681]  You're just idiots.
[01:56:30.681 --> 01:56:33.062]  You're real morons.
[01:56:33.062 --> 01:56:34.223]  Real fools.
[01:56:34.223 --> 01:56:36.684]  1% of the gun owners fight you.
[01:56:36.684 --> 01:56:38.585]  You're talking about millions of combatants.
[01:56:38.585 --> 01:56:46.329]  It'll just be... It'll be like trying to hunt a dodo bird after a few months.
[01:56:46.329 --> 01:56:46.730]  You know what?
[01:56:46.730 --> 01:56:49.711]  You can't hunt dodo birds because they're extinct.
[01:56:49.711 --> 01:56:52.093]  Don't be a dodo.
[01:56:52.093 --> 01:56:53.393]  Please.
[01:56:53.393 --> 01:56:56.155]  People always said don't be a dodo meaning it was a stupid bird.
[01:56:56.155 --> 01:56:57.055]  Don't be a dodo.
[01:56:57.055 --> 01:56:57.636]  Don't do it.
[01:56:59.045 --> 01:57:03.989]  I know you're all dressed up and ready.
[01:57:03.989 --> 01:57:09.633]  You can't tell a bull don't charge at a red cape.
[01:57:09.633 --> 01:57:15.277]  Going back to our guest, any final points you'd like to make, sir?
[01:57:16.414 --> 01:57:17.775]  Yes, Alex.
[01:57:17.775 --> 01:57:23.279]  You know, earlier you were talking about how you don't advise people to flick off the police.
[01:57:23.279 --> 01:57:26.321]  I also don't advise people to go around flicking off police.
[01:57:26.321 --> 01:57:29.323]  And I don't go around flicking off police.
[01:57:29.323 --> 01:57:35.627]  But this was the first time that I'd seen an armored vehicle with... I understand it was emotional.
[01:57:35.627 --> 01:57:36.487]  It was in the heat of the moment.
[01:57:36.487 --> 01:57:37.328]  I'm not judging you.
[01:57:37.328 --> 01:57:38.269]  I get what you did.
[01:57:39.925 --> 01:57:40.545]  Right.
[01:57:40.545 --> 01:57:43.668]  This isn't something that I commonly do.
[01:57:43.668 --> 01:57:44.048]  No, no.
[01:57:44.048 --> 01:57:48.152]  You just got mad by a bunch of guys in Marine Corps outfits with an armored vehicle at your college.
[01:57:48.152 --> 01:57:51.274]  You're just like, can't I get back to a free country again?
[01:57:51.274 --> 01:57:54.577]  And if you wanted to live in Guatemala, you'd go down there.
[01:57:54.577 --> 01:57:56.179]  I get it.
[01:57:56.179 --> 01:57:57.560]  Yes, sir.
[01:57:57.560 --> 01:57:59.662]  Listen, it's very upsetting when I've had the feds
[01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:02.241]  Get in my face and do stuff.
[01:58:02.241 --> 01:58:13.789]  They've been at this office multiple times and sometimes they're nice, sometimes they yell at me, and I just go, look, if you're going to act like a tough guy, just, you know, either get out of here or show me what you got.
[01:58:13.789 --> 01:58:18.532]  Alex, I really appreciate all the work that you do, waking folks up.
[01:58:18.532 --> 01:58:27.097]  And in my 14-page conscientious objector application where I talk about the changes that were made in my mind... Hold on, I want to hear this.
[01:58:27.097 --> 01:58:28.178]  We're back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:28.178 --> 01:58:28.638]  Don't hang up.
[01:58:28.638 --> 01:58:29.139]  Lucas Jewell.
[01:58:30.208 --> 01:58:31.909]  You can see his Facebook up there with him with Joe Rogan.
[01:58:31.909 --> 01:58:33.791]  And he's on his podcast.
[01:58:33.791 --> 01:58:35.131]  Lucas Jules, our guest.
[01:58:35.131 --> 01:58:35.692]  Stay with us.
[01:58:35.692 --> 01:58:39.434]  Back in the third hour.
[01:58:39.434 --> 01:58:40.855]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:40.855 --> 01:58:43.817]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:48.843 --> 01:58:50.104]  Another major health threat.
[01:58:50.104 --> 01:58:55.066]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:58:55.066 --> 01:58:57.747]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:58:57.747 --> 01:59:04.790]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:07.771]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:59:07.771 --> 01:59:10.732]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:59:10.732 --> 01:59:12.753]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:59:12.753 --> 01:59:15.594]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:59:15.674 --> 01:59:21.396]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:59:21.396 --> 01:59:24.918]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:59:24.918 --> 01:59:27.999]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:59:27.999 --> 01:59:35.322]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[02:00:02.481 --> 02:00:06.043]  Alright, Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:06.043 --> 02:00:06.943]  Mainstream Media.
[02:00:06.943 --> 02:00:07.824]  You want answers?
[02:00:07.824 --> 02:00:08.944]  Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:08.944 --> 02:00:09.585]  So do we.
[02:00:09.585 --> 02:00:11.165]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.165 --> 02:00:12.706]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.706 --> 02:00:16.888]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.888 --> 02:00:21.751]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.751 --> 02:00:25.313]  See, what I do with the police, or anybody, is I give them the benefit of the doubt.
[02:00:26.213 --> 02:00:27.373]  I'm not saying Jules wrong.
[02:00:27.373 --> 02:00:29.494]  He was in the heat of the moment, flipped him off.
[02:00:29.494 --> 02:00:30.154]  He's younger than I am.
[02:00:30.154 --> 02:00:32.215]  I've done similar things when I was younger.
[02:00:32.215 --> 02:00:34.356]  He... I would have pulled over.
[02:00:34.356 --> 02:00:37.657]  And then when they started saying, don't film me, I would have said, this is America.
[02:00:37.657 --> 02:00:39.977]  I'll do whatever I want.
[02:00:39.977 --> 02:00:41.918]  And when they threatened to attack me, I'd say, go ahead.
[02:00:42.952 --> 02:00:44.013]  And by the way, I'm not just saying that.
[02:00:44.013 --> 02:00:46.035]  I've done it with the Austin PD.
[02:00:46.035 --> 02:00:47.417]  Probably got to be 10 years ago.
[02:00:47.417 --> 02:00:49.159]  Footage is on YouTube.
[02:00:49.159 --> 02:00:55.205]  I've done it in New York, where army guys come running up with their guns and threaten to attack me if I don't stop filming.
[02:00:55.205 --> 02:00:56.666]  When I just get in their face, I go, let's go!
[02:00:56.666 --> 02:00:59.790]  I mean, that's in endgame.
[02:00:59.790 --> 02:01:01.111]  I just said, come on!
[02:01:01.111 --> 02:01:02.873]  And I wasn't looking for trouble, but I mean, you want to fight?
[02:01:02.873 --> 02:01:03.273]  Let's go!
[02:01:03.273 --> 02:01:05.416]  I mean, you know, that's treason.
[02:01:06.958 --> 02:01:08.499]  And so I'm not saying Lucas is wrong.
[02:01:08.499 --> 02:01:11.700]  I think you showed a lot of restraint when they're thuggishly telling you don't aim your camera at them.
[02:01:11.700 --> 02:01:19.904]  But Lucas, you were talking about when you were a conscientious objector getting out of the Navy, not want to be part of these evil wars, like the ones helping Al-Qaeda take over Syria.
[02:01:19.904 --> 02:01:22.645]  Go ahead and make your point.
[02:01:22.645 --> 02:01:24.106]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:24.106 --> 02:01:32.750]  So I had to file a 14-page application to explain how my beliefs had changed since I'd been in the military.
[02:01:34.133 --> 02:01:58.309]  And I explained that through listening to your show, through watching documentaries such as Freedom to Fascism, Endgame, Police Day, Loose Change, you know, that's what caused me to see this in another perspective, and that's what made me incapable of fighting for this empire.
[02:01:59.963 --> 02:02:09.991]  Well, it's certainly true that more and more our military does serve the corporate interests that have seized control of this nation, and so they gave you your conscientious objector out.
[02:02:09.991 --> 02:02:11.092]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:11.092 --> 02:02:16.636]  It's a hard fight, and I would just encourage anyone in the military listening to go to G.I.
[02:02:16.636 --> 02:02:18.618]  Wright's hotline, go to the G.I.
[02:02:18.618 --> 02:02:24.303]  Wright's hotline website, and talk to them about becoming a conscientious objector.
[02:02:24.303 --> 02:02:29.567]  I think it's a really good program, and chances are, if you're a listener to the Alex Jones Show,
[02:02:30.094 --> 02:02:35.280]  You can convince the military that you don't need to be there.
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:42.848]  No, they get it, that you understand that the military, I mean, it's kind of like the Border Patrol, and we drive through, and they want to search us, and we go, but you don't search the illegals.
[02:02:42.848 --> 02:02:45.130]  They go, yeah, you're right, go on, we have the gun tape.
[02:02:45.130 --> 02:02:52.217]  I mean, it's just the military, the Border Patrol, none of it does the constitutional duty, and now with Jade Helm,
[02:02:52.918 --> 02:02:54.779]  With them wanting to train to take on the American people.
[02:02:54.779 --> 02:02:58.320]  And we've now confirmed that they've, in Jade Helms stuff, it's already starting.
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:01.281]  They've got trucks that say 3% on it for the drills.
[02:03:01.281 --> 02:03:03.142]  They're practicing taking on sovereign citizens.
[02:03:03.142 --> 02:03:04.442]  We have video.
[02:03:04.442 --> 02:03:10.945]  I mean, Jade Helms really, the exercises that are beginning ahead of it, they're gearing up a major operation.
[02:03:10.945 --> 02:03:14.046]  They're buying billions of rounds of ammo.
[02:03:14.046 --> 02:03:16.287]  You'll have to be a conscientious objector.
[02:03:16.287 --> 02:03:20.768]  Most of the military, I think, is going to say no when they ask them to march out and try to carry this out.
[02:03:20.768 --> 02:03:22.109]  What do you think the politicians are thinking?
[02:03:24.398 --> 02:03:36.220]  I think that they're control freaks, as you sometimes say, and I feel like they are disconnected from reality, even at the local level sometimes.
[02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:49.823]  You know, I recently ran for city commission, and even in the city government, these city commissioners and the county commissioners feel as if they're elite, and feel
[02:03:50.638 --> 02:03:58.084]  Like, they're superior people and they are very disconnected and I don't think they understand how angry we are about this.
[02:03:58.084 --> 02:04:07.010]  Well, I mean, I agree, their minions don't know what's going on, but up on top, they've got the NSA spy grids, the algorithms, they know that the country's on the verge of revolution.
[02:04:07.010 --> 02:04:12.354]  They want to steer it into some kind of leftist, burn down cities, kill all the police, so the feds and the UN come in.
[02:04:12.354 --> 02:04:13.075]  We don't want that.
[02:04:14.232 --> 02:04:17.134]  I mean, it only helps them, even if you hate the cops, which I don't.
[02:04:17.134 --> 02:04:19.977]  Killing them, burning things down only helps the globalists.
[02:04:19.977 --> 02:04:21.098]  That's why they're funding it.
[02:04:21.098 --> 02:04:24.340]  We've got to take the counties and cities back, reach out to the police if we can.
[02:04:24.340 --> 02:04:30.145]  See, Jade Helms meant to reach out to military and police and to see who'll go along with the takeover.
[02:04:30.145 --> 02:04:31.706]  We need to be reaching out.
[02:04:31.706 --> 02:04:33.587]  We need to counter everything the enemy does.
[02:04:33.587 --> 02:04:35.049]  Well, Lucas, what are you doing these days?
[02:04:36.379 --> 02:04:40.984]  I'm a student here at Santa Fe College, going and getting my degree in economics.
[02:04:40.984 --> 02:04:46.729]  After that, I plan to go to law school and fight that way.
[02:04:46.729 --> 02:04:48.791]  Alright, very, very exciting.
[02:04:48.791 --> 02:04:52.034]  People can follow you at J-V-I-L-L-E at Facebook.
[02:04:52.034 --> 02:04:53.655]  Lucas Jewell, thank you so much.
[02:04:53.655 --> 02:04:55.257]  Good job with your overall report.
[02:04:55.257 --> 02:04:56.438]  You got a lot of cojones.
[02:04:58.803 --> 02:05:04.866]  Recently, InfoWars requested press credentials to film a dirty bomb drill in Richmond, California.
[02:05:04.866 --> 02:05:13.890]  We were denied access because the Deputy Director of Public Affairs at the California Military Department felt that we would somehow misconstrue the activities of the exercise.
[02:05:14.130 --> 02:05:20.473]  Turns out, the dirty bomb drill also included training for dealing with self-identified sovereign citizens.
[02:05:20.473 --> 02:05:32.379]  I do recognize that some sovereign citizens have been involved in extremist activity, but I also recognize that sovereign citizens are habitually lumped in with law-abiding conservatives and libertarians.
[02:05:32.379 --> 02:05:35.921]  With recent civil unrest, I get training for crowd control.
[02:05:36.201 --> 02:05:41.386]  And I most definitely want our military, police, and federal agents to deal with the public safely.
[02:05:41.386 --> 02:05:46.831]  But I don't want citizens viewed as an enemy for quoting the Declaration of Independence or our U.S.
[02:05:46.831 --> 02:05:47.932]  Constitution.
[02:05:47.932 --> 02:05:51.855]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[02:05:51.855 --> 02:05:57.240]  Keep up with our latest videos and information at the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[02:05:59.312 --> 02:06:00.873]  In the near future.
[02:06:00.873 --> 02:06:04.535]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:06:04.535 --> 02:06:05.355]  Security alert.
[02:06:05.355 --> 02:06:06.576]  Security alert.
[02:06:06.576 --> 02:06:08.597]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:06:08.597 --> 02:06:09.478]  Analysis.
[02:06:09.478 --> 02:06:10.198]  InfoWars.
[02:06:10.198 --> 02:06:12.299]  Building independent media operations.
[02:06:12.299 --> 02:06:17.182]  But the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:06:17.182 --> 02:06:18.222]  Prime Directive.
[02:06:18.222 --> 02:06:19.763]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:06:19.763 --> 02:06:22.605]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:06:22.605 --> 02:06:25.867]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:06:25.867 --> 02:06:28.028]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:06:28.148 --> 02:06:29.669]  These people are assaulting us!
[02:06:29.669 --> 02:06:32.511]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:06:32.511 --> 02:06:34.452]  They are never going to stop.
[02:06:34.452 --> 02:06:38.494]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[02:06:46.439 --> 02:06:48.480]  Destroy Little Minute TV.
[02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:53.163]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:06:53.163 --> 02:06:54.544]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[02:06:54.544 --> 02:06:55.285]  You can feel it.

[02:08:05.986 --> 02:08:13.430]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:14.730]  Rallying!
[02:08:14.730 --> 02:08:16.831]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[02:08:16.831 --> 02:08:20.533]  That's what we're doing.
[02:08:20.533 --> 02:08:21.073]  What is a rally?
[02:08:21.073 --> 02:08:27.536]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:27.536 --> 02:08:30.598]  The modern, colloquial,
[02:08:31.883 --> 02:08:41.830]  Belief in a rally is rallying for a politician or a pep rally the night before a playoff game.
[02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:55.439]  And of course those are archetypal simulations of a tribe about to march off to battle to defend their land in the morning and there is a rally to get fired up and say bye to everybody and have a good time and
[02:08:57.281 --> 02:09:05.804]  Daddy spends some time with Mama, say bye to the kids in the early morning light, and march off and fight to the death.
[02:09:05.804 --> 02:09:13.226]  So when we say rallying patriots worldwide, you would have a flagman if you go back to medieval warfare and right through to the Renaissance.
[02:09:14.380 --> 02:09:20.482]  With different units in a battle, if people got too broken up, they would give the orders with the flags.
[02:09:20.482 --> 02:09:25.084]  They had flags back at the top giving directives, and then down lower they had sub-flag directives.
[02:09:25.084 --> 02:09:29.485]  You'd have someone swaying a flag, blowing a horn, a certain number of blows.
[02:09:29.485 --> 02:09:32.346]  There were different ways to communicate.
[02:09:32.346 --> 02:09:33.866]  So that you knew, you need to be over here.
[02:09:33.866 --> 02:09:36.027]  You need to rally.
[02:09:36.027 --> 02:09:40.288]  And really, there's so many, hundreds of millions of people that know what's going on worldwide.
[02:09:40.288 --> 02:09:41.589]  That's a conservative number.
[02:09:44.670 --> 02:09:50.795]  That it's a piece of cake if you just don't expect that you've got to defeat the whole globalist system by yourself.
[02:09:50.795 --> 02:09:54.037]  You've just got to vote with your dollars, or vote whatever your currency is.
[02:09:54.037 --> 02:09:59.442]  You've got to not comply with stuff that you know is anti-human, unconstitutional.
[02:09:59.442 --> 02:10:08.869]  You've got to support people and corporations and governments and individuals that do the right thing, sometimes even in a bad organization, and you've got to stand up against those that are bad.
[02:10:08.869 --> 02:10:10.150]  And you've got to have a little backbone.
[02:10:12.441 --> 02:10:14.383]  I mean, I don't think of it as any big deal.
[02:10:14.383 --> 02:10:17.906]  In fact, the only thing I can think of is probably 15 examples.
[02:10:17.906 --> 02:10:19.227]  Do you guys cue up an endgame?
[02:10:19.227 --> 02:10:22.109]  It's like towards the end.
[02:10:22.109 --> 02:10:27.114]  I know Biggs put it in one of his reports, where the National Guard just comes running like 25 yards up to me.
[02:10:27.114 --> 02:10:29.195]  It wasn't National Guard, it was Army, sorry.
[02:10:29.195 --> 02:10:32.098]  And they have sidearms on.
[02:10:32.098 --> 02:10:35.981]  And it looked like 45s to me.
[02:10:35.981 --> 02:10:37.462]  I thought they carried 9 millimeters by now.
[02:10:40.347 --> 02:10:45.552]  And they basically say, you know, you turn that camera off or I'm going to, you know, basically attack you.
[02:10:45.552 --> 02:10:47.855]  And I said, no, and it wasn't.
[02:10:47.855 --> 02:10:55.302]  And after the, after I stood them down and then following them, yelling at them to their van, because by then I'm quite frankly, want to get in a fight.
[02:10:55.302 --> 02:10:57.484]  Nothing gets me more excited than like five, six guys want to fight me.
[02:10:57.484 --> 02:10:59.106]  I don't know why it's just like you're in a primitive mode.
[02:10:59.106 --> 02:11:00.467]  I want to attack.
[02:11:00.467 --> 02:11:00.687]  And, um,
[02:11:03.902 --> 02:11:06.703]  Everybody's like, wow, you just ran all those guys off into their van.
[02:11:06.703 --> 02:11:08.024]  Oh my gosh.
[02:11:08.024 --> 02:11:11.886]  And it just made me realize how domesticated people are.
[02:11:11.886 --> 02:11:17.808]  Like that's a normal response of people getting in your face telling you can't film in America.
[02:11:17.808 --> 02:11:20.649]  I don't live in North Korea.
[02:11:20.649 --> 02:11:26.892]  I don't live in a third world hell pit where we have no rights.
[02:11:26.892 --> 02:11:28.353]  At least maybe you want us to live there.
[02:11:28.353 --> 02:11:28.653]  I don't.
[02:11:30.402 --> 02:11:37.428]  And sure, they could have probably ended up beating me up or shooting me, but then it'd be like the Alamo, just a little example of it.
[02:11:37.428 --> 02:11:40.370]  Or it'd be like Gallipoli, the 300.
[02:11:40.370 --> 02:11:44.713]  I'm not here to try to live and try to only take care of myself.
[02:11:44.713 --> 02:11:52.399]  I'd rather that be that way, but I understand that I'm here to be attacked, I'm here to be demonized, I'm here to be lied about.
[02:11:52.399 --> 02:11:56.863]  And I see people all the time, they go, man, they were on MSNBC again last night, I don't even tune into it to see now.
[02:11:57.796 --> 02:12:04.302]  And they were saying that you were a racist and a terrorist again, and that you need to be basically arrested, or... And then I actually later see the clip.
[02:12:04.302 --> 02:12:05.463]  I mean, we can play these clips here.
[02:12:05.463 --> 02:12:07.846]  I mean, there's dozens and dozens and dozens.
[02:12:07.846 --> 02:12:16.694]  Their audience is so small, though, that I'll hear like, yeah, I was in a restaurant, they were tagging me on the TV, I saw the closed captioning, or yeah, I was at work, they had it on.
[02:12:16.694 --> 02:12:17.815]  CNN, you name it.
[02:12:17.815 --> 02:12:19.517]  Why do they do that?
[02:12:19.517 --> 02:12:22.780]  Because they're scared, ladies and gentlemen, and it's not because I'm anything special.
[02:12:24.343 --> 02:12:26.344]  It's because I'm just willing to stand up to them.
[02:12:26.344 --> 02:12:30.306]  A pack of scumbag liar crooks.
[02:12:30.306 --> 02:12:33.448]  It's criminal to say I'm involved in the Boston bombing.
[02:12:33.448 --> 02:12:38.151]  It's criminal to sit up there and say I need to be arrested.
[02:12:38.151 --> 02:12:40.272]  Folks, if they can arrest me, they can arrest you.
[02:12:40.272 --> 02:12:41.933]  Understand that.
[02:12:41.933 --> 02:12:44.194]  So, I'm not up here bragging about I've got this courage.
[02:12:44.194 --> 02:12:45.195]  It isn't even courage.
[02:12:45.195 --> 02:12:46.736]  We're being overrun!
[02:12:46.736 --> 02:12:52.499]  I would have to have the most mindless, blind, dumb courage to not fight.
[02:12:53.729 --> 02:12:55.070]  I can't help it.
[02:12:55.070 --> 02:12:56.370]  I mean, I'll use the analogy.
[02:12:56.370 --> 02:12:58.351]  If I woke up one night, there was a burglar in my room.
[02:12:58.351 --> 02:13:00.772]  We've all seen surveillance footage of stuff like this happening.
[02:13:00.772 --> 02:13:02.593]  People freeze and let him attack them.
[02:13:02.593 --> 02:13:04.874]  I mean, I'll go completely crazy and attack the person.
[02:13:04.874 --> 02:13:06.755]  I would panic, not even in my fear.
[02:13:06.755 --> 02:13:08.916]  It's not the word.
[02:13:08.916 --> 02:13:09.876]  It's fight or flight.
[02:13:09.876 --> 02:13:15.279]  I would attack them because it feels good.
[02:13:15.279 --> 02:13:19.301]  Just like if I woke up and felt something on my face and jump out of the bed, there's a spider on the bed.
[02:13:19.301 --> 02:13:21.982]  I'm going to try to kill it because I am scared of it.
[02:13:24.804 --> 02:13:27.526]  Not because I'm a hero.
[02:13:27.526 --> 02:13:28.908]  I told the story one time to my kids.
[02:13:28.908 --> 02:13:33.652]  I woke up, parents had a three-story house in Northwest Austin with all these bugs in it.
[02:13:33.652 --> 02:13:40.078]  It was a beautiful house up on a hilltop and it was the favorite house I've ever lived in.
[02:13:40.078 --> 02:13:45.102]  But it had Texas centipedes that are like 10 inches, 12 inches long.
[02:13:45.102 --> 02:13:46.003]  I'm not exaggerating.
[02:13:46.003 --> 02:13:47.324]  It's huge.
[02:13:47.324 --> 02:13:47.945]  Biggest in the world.
[02:13:49.844 --> 02:13:51.804]  Everything's big in Texas, I guess.
[02:13:51.804 --> 02:13:55.285]  And, um, scorpions, four or five different species.
[02:13:55.285 --> 02:13:59.026]  You'd be walking down the hall and one would be on the ceiling and just fall on you and sting you.
[02:13:59.026 --> 02:14:02.267]  I mean, it was just, it was a menagerie of insects.
[02:14:02.267 --> 02:14:04.747]  And so I lived on the bottom floor.
[02:14:04.747 --> 02:14:06.048]  It was a skinny house.
[02:14:06.048 --> 02:14:11.929]  It was like, it was a big house, but the point is I lived on the bottom floor and that's the floor they were all coming in on.
[02:14:12.967 --> 02:14:20.229]  And it was like all the time it'd be a wolf spider in the bed, a tarantula, a scorpion.
[02:14:20.229 --> 02:14:24.931]  I started getting, when I get in my bedclothes every night, I was like, can you guys just get rid of this house?
[02:14:24.931 --> 02:14:28.212]  I want to, by then I got out of high school, moved out anyways and ended up moving as well.
[02:14:28.212 --> 02:14:31.413]  But that was a great house, but horrible with the bugs.
[02:14:31.413 --> 02:14:34.654]  But it wasn't that I had courage.
[02:14:34.654 --> 02:14:36.354]  I was checking the bed every night.
[02:14:36.354 --> 02:14:37.154]  It was the opposite.
[02:14:37.154 --> 02:14:38.415]  I didn't like bugs in my bed.
[02:14:38.415 --> 02:14:39.355]  I wanted to do something about it.
[02:14:39.355 --> 02:14:41.916]  It's the same thing I'm fighting the globalists over.
[02:14:43.712 --> 02:14:44.953]  I want to get rid of them.
[02:14:44.953 --> 02:14:46.193]  I want to reverse them.
[02:14:46.193 --> 02:14:47.374]  I want to expose them.
[02:14:47.374 --> 02:14:48.595]  I want to overcome them.
[02:14:48.595 --> 02:14:51.136]  I want to stop them.
[02:14:51.136 --> 02:14:51.916]  But I'll tell you the story.
[02:14:51.916 --> 02:14:53.017]  One night I was laying there.
[02:14:53.017 --> 02:14:56.859]  I had my hand out, went on the bed, and I felt something on it, touching it, touching it, touching it.
[02:14:57.875 --> 02:14:58.895]  There's a little lamp right here.
[02:14:58.895 --> 02:15:08.880]  I turn it on, control myself and look and there is a five inch long flesh colored millipede or centipede in my hand eating on a little flat from the gym.
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:12.181]  So back then I worked out really hard with heavy weights, you know, all the torn.
[02:15:12.181 --> 02:15:15.603]  It was chewing on my callus, having a little snack.
[02:15:15.603 --> 02:15:19.364]  And I went, and, uh, you know, grabbed a book and smashed it.
[02:15:19.364 --> 02:15:23.206]  I don't know why I'm telling that story in the analogy of the new world order.
[02:15:24.153 --> 02:15:28.014]  It's just, it's not courage that I killed the millipede or centipede.
[02:15:28.014 --> 02:15:29.854]  I don't know what species that was.
[02:15:29.854 --> 02:15:33.475]  It was that I didn't like it and it was gross.
[02:15:33.475 --> 02:15:34.656]  And it's the same thing.
[02:15:34.656 --> 02:15:36.356]  That's why I don't want to be thanked for doing the job.
[02:15:36.356 --> 02:15:39.037]  And I hammer this a lot because it's so important.
[02:15:39.037 --> 02:15:43.738]  This is not something I should be thanked for.
[02:15:43.738 --> 02:15:44.618]  This is normal.
[02:15:46.662 --> 02:15:51.083]  I mean, the President is ruling as a dictator on every issue now.
[02:15:51.083 --> 02:15:53.784]  The borders are completely wide open.
[02:15:53.784 --> 02:15:58.666]  The country's already being folded into a North American Union, that union into the Asian and EU Union.
[02:15:58.666 --> 02:16:03.627]  I have clips of Bush in Endgame on C-SPAN saying they're going to merge the three unions.
[02:16:03.627 --> 02:16:06.668]  That's the plan since the 70s.
[02:16:06.668 --> 02:16:08.549]  The trilateral plan.
[02:16:08.549 --> 02:16:11.670]  You guys ever find the Barry Goldwater quote?
[02:16:11.670 --> 02:16:15.991]  Senator Goldwater about the trilateralist plan to overthrow the country and bring in a world government with three global arms?
[02:16:17.383 --> 02:16:18.423]  Yeah, we had that the other day.
[02:16:18.423 --> 02:16:19.484]  Oh, you had that the other day?
[02:16:19.484 --> 02:16:20.324]  I never covered it.
[02:16:20.324 --> 02:16:20.724]  It's fine.
[02:16:20.724 --> 02:16:23.505]  Just get it because people won't believe me.
[02:16:23.505 --> 02:16:26.866]  We know the plan.
[02:16:26.866 --> 02:16:44.593]  It'd be like if you had little kids disappearing out of their backyards and then a guy has a car wreck and the back of the van bust open and they find photos of the missing dead kids and a handwritten journal why the guy did it and a video of why he did it and then you just, he goes, but it's a conspiracy and the cops let him go.
[02:16:45.396 --> 02:16:47.718]  It's a conspiracy theory that those are photos.
[02:16:47.718 --> 02:16:54.564]  The cops are holding photos of the dead children that are missing and the cops go, okay, you said it's a conspiracy theory?
[02:16:54.564 --> 02:16:56.265]  Thank you, sir, we believe it's not you.
[02:16:56.265 --> 02:16:58.307]  We have all the proof.
[02:16:58.307 --> 02:17:00.348]  Do you understand how frustrating this is?
[02:17:00.348 --> 02:17:04.792]  I don't want to be thanked by anybody in the middle of a total globalist takeover.
[02:17:04.792 --> 02:17:08.495]  I'm like at the Alamo swinging a musket here with bullet wounds politically in me.
[02:17:08.795 --> 02:17:12.257]  They're already killing my name or trying as hard as they can.
[02:17:12.257 --> 02:17:14.379]  They're so discredited it's having a dual effect.
[02:17:14.379 --> 02:17:16.821]  I'm like The Walking Dead or something politically.
[02:17:16.821 --> 02:17:17.941]  I just keep coming.
[02:17:17.941 --> 02:17:24.166]  But it doesn't matter because we're launching new generations of people who they haven't assassinated their names.
[02:17:24.166 --> 02:17:27.288]  But if they want to assassinate my name before assassinating me.
[02:17:29.301 --> 02:17:31.783]  So I realized I did all this through self-preservation.
[02:17:31.783 --> 02:17:38.149]  I did it because my instinct was to not get on my knees and suck on someone's boots while they put a gun to the back of my head.
[02:17:38.149 --> 02:17:40.831]  I'm never going to do that.
[02:17:40.831 --> 02:17:44.674]  And there's no excuse for people in government and corporations now to live in denial.
[02:17:44.674 --> 02:17:46.596]  We're going into hardcore tyranny.
[02:17:46.596 --> 02:17:47.877]  Things are falling apart.
[02:17:49.141 --> 02:17:53.165]  The public on average is very decadent and degenerate and self-serving.
[02:17:53.165 --> 02:17:56.409]  They're living off all the liberty we had and don't appreciate it.
[02:17:56.409 --> 02:17:57.991]  So they're bad as well.
[02:17:57.991 --> 02:17:58.811]  I look in the mirror.
[02:17:58.811 --> 02:17:59.652]  I'm bad as well.
[02:17:59.652 --> 02:18:00.834]  I'm not on a high horse.
[02:18:00.834 --> 02:18:06.440]  But man, we can't let George Soros start World War III with the Russians.
[02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:09.423]  Let's go ahead and go to the top Nobel laureate.
[02:18:09.423 --> 02:18:09.903]  He just died.
[02:18:09.903 --> 02:18:10.905]  He said we're going into World War III.
[02:18:12.606 --> 02:18:23.218]  The Trilateral Commission is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political governments of the United States.
[02:18:23.218 --> 02:18:33.090]  The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power, political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical.
[02:18:34.124 --> 02:18:41.726]  What the Trilateral Commission intends to create, a worldwide economic power superior to the political governments of the nation-states involved.
[02:18:41.726 --> 02:18:46.047]  As managers and creators of the system, they will rule the future.
[02:18:46.047 --> 02:18:46.347]  U.S.
[02:18:46.347 --> 02:18:52.068]  Senator Barry Goldwater in his 1964 book with no apologies.
[02:18:52.068 --> 02:18:57.449]  And let me give you the rest of the story, and every sociologist, psychologist knows this.
[02:18:57.449 --> 02:19:01.710]  When the elite are done battling with the nation-states and the individual, they're going to turn on each other.
[02:19:03.066 --> 02:19:04.786]  The three unions are going to have trade wars.
[02:19:04.786 --> 02:19:05.907]  That's part of the plan.
[02:19:05.907 --> 02:19:07.367]  That's how smart these guys are.
[02:19:07.367 --> 02:19:10.448]  And then out of that global collapse, this is David Rockefeller writing.
[02:19:10.448 --> 02:19:11.868]  You might want to read it.
[02:19:11.868 --> 02:19:13.649]  You can pull that up, I guess.
[02:19:13.649 --> 02:19:19.790]  Out of that global collapse, they then bring in the one world government with the Castle Society.
[02:19:19.790 --> 02:19:21.110]  And you know what drives it?
[02:19:21.110 --> 02:19:22.551]  What its operating system is?
[02:19:22.551 --> 02:19:24.011]  Eugenics.
[02:19:24.011 --> 02:19:24.671]  Eugenics.
[02:19:24.671 --> 02:19:25.571]  It's eugenical.
[02:19:25.571 --> 02:19:29.072]  And it's of the devil.
[02:19:29.072 --> 02:19:31.213]  I just got chills.
[02:19:31.213 --> 02:19:32.113]  Oh, man, these people.
[02:19:32.617 --> 02:19:58.366]  And I, you know, I mean, I knew this stuff was real 20 years ago, but man, 20 years, so much of it's now come true, and then I look at the next chapters of the book, that happen pretty much the way they say they will, just a little bit different, and I just go, man, whoo, if people knew the dark road we're going down, people would be saying, let's turn around right now, because we're marching right into Mordor, right into hell itself, and you can smell the stench.

[02:20:58.411 --> 02:21:00.352]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[02:21:00.352 --> 02:21:03.992]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[02:21:03.992 --> 02:21:05.333]  A pair of scissors.
[02:21:05.333 --> 02:21:11.134]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[02:21:11.134 --> 02:21:16.055]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[02:21:16.055 --> 02:21:17.036]  The phone line.
[02:21:17.036 --> 02:21:22.297]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[02:21:22.297 --> 02:21:26.038]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[02:21:26.198 --> 02:21:29.521]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.

[02:21:31.984 --> 02:21:36.328]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[02:21:36.328 --> 02:21:37.409]  Scissors can't cut it.
[02:21:37.409 --> 02:21:39.671]  And that means your home stays safe.

[02:22:01.115 --> 02:22:10.843]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:22:10.843 --> 02:22:13.545]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:22:13.545 --> 02:22:16.888]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:22:17.108 --> 02:22:23.413]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[02:22:23.413 --> 02:22:28.557]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:22:28.557 --> 02:22:34.942]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[02:22:34.942 --> 02:22:42.408]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[02:22:42.668 --> 02:22:50.217]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[02:22:57.585 --> 02:22:58.805]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:58.805 --> 02:23:03.307]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:23:03.307 --> 02:23:08.989]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:23:08.989 --> 02:23:12.550]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:15.271]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:15.271 --> 02:23:20.273]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:23:20.273 --> 02:23:20.513]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:20.513 --> 02:23:21.893]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:27.625 --> 02:23:28.425]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:23:28.425 --> 02:23:30.226]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:23:30.226 --> 02:23:31.867]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:23:31.867 --> 02:23:34.708]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:23:34.708 --> 02:23:36.988]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:23:36.988 --> 02:23:41.510]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:45.451]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:23:45.451 --> 02:23:49.213]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[02:23:49.213 --> 02:23:49.533]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:23:49.533 --> 02:23:51.273]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[02:24:04.713 --> 02:24:08.917]  You put him in control.
[02:24:08.917 --> 02:24:11.459]  And put him in control.
[02:24:11.459 --> 02:24:12.920]  Watch him become a god.
[02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:17.144]  I want to play the Death Race 2000 intro.
[02:24:17.144 --> 02:24:18.866]  Let's turn to the next segment.
[02:24:37.899 --> 02:24:46.401]  Just like the Piper, let ISIS loose.
[02:24:46.401 --> 02:24:57.144]  And then you pay the Piper to come in and play his tune, and not only the rats leave, you go to the river and drown, but your children do.
[02:24:57.144 --> 02:25:02.246]  The archetype of your whole future, your whole civilization, your real wealth, your children.
[02:25:04.175 --> 02:25:06.116]  But these children didn't march under the river.
[02:25:06.116 --> 02:25:10.677]  They were chopped up, 50 plus million of them, in their mother's womb.
[02:25:10.677 --> 02:25:15.959]  All to the pipe of the Pied Piper.
[02:25:15.959 --> 02:25:21.580]  Isn't that loving and high horse liberal?
[02:25:21.580 --> 02:25:26.482]  The caring people that lecture us because they said so?
[02:25:26.482 --> 02:25:28.863]  They said they were the moral authority.
[02:25:28.863 --> 02:25:31.283]  They said they were the bosses.
[02:25:31.283 --> 02:25:32.924]  They said we were racist.
[02:25:34.159 --> 02:25:40.703]  And homophobic, and miserly, and hateful, and bad.
[02:25:40.703 --> 02:25:44.305]  But it was they who were bad.
[02:25:44.305 --> 02:25:49.128]  They were the authors of our discontent.
[02:25:49.128 --> 02:25:52.050]  They were the authors of our degeneration and our fall.
[02:25:52.050 --> 02:25:57.173]  Oh sure, we helped along the way, but they had the intent.
[02:25:57.173 --> 02:26:00.035]  They were steering the ship.
[02:26:00.035 --> 02:26:01.756]  Our own decadence filled the sails.
[02:26:04.531 --> 02:26:08.974]  But the Kapitan, he knew the plan.
[02:26:08.974 --> 02:26:11.175]  And he lied.
[02:26:11.175 --> 02:26:23.343]  When he could have turned our boat towards incredible fortune, believing in humanity and believing in free will, but the devil doesn't like God's creations and doesn't like free will.
[02:26:23.343 --> 02:26:29.407]  And no amount of service to Satan will ever make the devil love you or empower you.
[02:26:29.407 --> 02:26:32.249]  The devil will forsake you!
[02:26:33.854 --> 02:26:37.356]  New World Order, your father is not even your father.
[02:26:37.356 --> 02:26:39.016]  God is our father.
[02:26:39.016 --> 02:26:47.940]  Your stepfather that you love is a fraud and will strangle you in your bed.
[02:26:47.940 --> 02:26:58.545]  Kit has done a basic breakdown just off Fed.BizOpps, but he's also writing a blurb in the Watson's article to explain that that's clearly not all of it and they're covering up.
[02:27:00.677 --> 02:27:08.880]  But since April 2012, he's got the spreadsheet from FedBizOpps, 2.11 billion.
[02:27:08.880 --> 02:27:09.801]  They just keep saying 1.6.
[02:27:09.801 --> 02:27:13.782]  I say it's over 3 billion, but Kit broke it down.
[02:27:13.782 --> 02:27:16.943]  2.11 billion.
[02:27:16.943 --> 02:27:18.924]  So 2 billion, 100 plus million.
[02:27:18.924 --> 02:27:21.605]  Rounds of ammo, not including blanks.
[02:27:21.605 --> 02:27:25.487]  War in Iraq used an estimate 66 million rounds a year.
[02:27:27.455 --> 02:27:35.857]  Or 5.5 million per month times 12.
[02:27:35.857 --> 02:27:47.061]  Feds have bought enough ammo that we know of to wage a 32-year war in Iraq, or more likely here in the U.S., and we're going to add to that, no, we know, and you can link to it, they're training to take the American people on.
[02:27:47.061 --> 02:27:48.101]  I mean, think about that.
[02:27:49.199 --> 02:27:51.700]  And it's not if it's true, it is true.
[02:27:51.700 --> 02:28:05.965]  That the government, like it's Manhattan Project times ten, I mean it is just tens of billions a month we know of, is just hardening everything, digging in, training to fight the three percenters, the gun owners, the veterans.
[02:28:05.965 --> 02:28:10.066]  What do they have planned so horrible that the people will fight back?
[02:28:10.066 --> 02:28:13.987]  Because the one plan's been, do the tyranny so incremental that we just kind of put up with it.
[02:28:13.987 --> 02:28:15.528]  But now it's getting so crazy.
[02:28:15.528 --> 02:28:16.228]  What are they planning?
[02:28:16.228 --> 02:28:17.769]  They're going to come after the patriots.
[02:28:17.769 --> 02:28:18.409]  They're going to start it.
[02:28:20.916 --> 02:28:24.299]  After the federal buildings were hit today and a shopping mall by the 3% group.
[02:28:24.299 --> 02:28:26.401]  It'll be like that.
[02:28:26.401 --> 02:28:32.067]  We were able to take out the leadership of the group hours after they killed hundreds at each facility.
[02:28:32.067 --> 02:28:33.989]  They did it, they said, for Alex Jones.
[02:28:33.989 --> 02:28:35.831]  You've seen all the other newscasts.
[02:28:35.831 --> 02:28:38.753]  They did it, they said, because he told them.
[02:28:38.753 --> 02:28:42.897]  And you'll hear, well, we took out the terrorist leader, Jones, on his way to work.
[02:28:42.897 --> 02:28:44.839]  He claimed he was against violence, but we all know the truth.
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:48.221]  Ron Paul was also involved.
[02:28:48.221 --> 02:28:53.603]  I mean, I'm telling you folks, whenever they blow something up, who do they blame?
[02:28:53.603 --> 02:28:55.444]  Whenever the cops get shot, who do they blame?
[02:28:55.444 --> 02:28:57.145]  Me!
[02:28:57.145 --> 02:28:58.805]  You think that's a power trip they do?
[02:28:58.805 --> 02:29:02.547]  You think it's fun to have these killers looking at me?
[02:29:02.547 --> 02:29:03.748]  Well, it just gives me energy.
[02:29:03.748 --> 02:29:05.749]  I just know I'm whistling past the graveyard.
[02:29:05.749 --> 02:29:06.489]  Whatever's got to be done.
[02:29:10.182 --> 02:29:12.063]  Do other people have the nerve to go up against these folks?
[02:29:12.063 --> 02:29:14.745]  Because let me tell you something, it isn't nerve to go up against them.
[02:29:14.745 --> 02:29:15.906]  They're already here.
[02:29:15.906 --> 02:29:17.507]  They're going to get all of our innocence.
[02:29:17.507 --> 02:29:19.248]  They're going to keep hurting children and babies.
[02:29:19.248 --> 02:29:25.732]  You just think about all those kids they've aborted, all the little kids they're kidnapping, and all the sex rings, and all the Satanism, and then ask if you care about your life.
[02:29:25.732 --> 02:29:27.673]  Of course you don't!
[02:29:27.673 --> 02:29:29.494]  And that's what being Christlike is.
[02:29:29.494 --> 02:29:30.795]  Not that I'm Christlike in many ways.
[02:29:30.795 --> 02:29:32.596]  I'm very worldly and I'm evil.
[02:29:32.596 --> 02:29:36.819]  That's why God has used me and many others who were evil, like Saul,
[02:29:38.163 --> 02:29:39.565]  Of Tarsus and many others.
[02:29:39.565 --> 02:29:43.329]  God isn't looking, like William Blake said, for a bunch of wimps.
[02:29:43.329 --> 02:29:47.995]  God's looking for men that are willing to take out these evil people.
[02:29:47.995 --> 02:29:49.416]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.416 --> 02:29:51.939]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.939 --> 02:29:54.623]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.783 --> 02:30:03.370]  Your Federal Reserve tribute known as the income tax is due on April 15th.
[02:30:03.370 --> 02:30:07.916]  That is, unless you're one of the following Fortune 500 companies that aren't paying any taxes.
[02:30:07.916 --> 02:30:14.606]  Daily Mail reports, the Fortune 500 companies that didn't pay a penny in 2014 income tax despite being worth billions.
[02:30:15.146 --> 02:30:25.377]  Some of the companies include CBS, Mattel, Prudential, Time Warner, Owens Corning, JetBlue, Xerox, Priceline.com, and perennial bomb maker General Electric.
[02:30:25.377 --> 02:30:28.099]  Some of these companies even got tax rebates back.
[02:30:28.099 --> 02:30:29.421]  Are you serious?
[02:30:29.421 --> 02:30:31.883]  Thank goodness we have Hillary Clinton who's now attacking the 1%.
[02:30:33.164 --> 02:30:34.644]  He really means it!
[02:30:34.644 --> 02:30:50.268]  Did you know that Ronald Reagan's Grace Commission report found that one-third of all income taxes are consumed by waste and inefficiency in the federal government, and 100% of what is collected is absorbed solely by interest on the federal debt, which means that your tax dollars are paid to the private, run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[02:30:50.268 --> 02:30:55.109]  Bow down to your overlords and pay your stinking taxes, unless you're one of these Fortune 500 companies.
[02:30:55.109 --> 02:30:57.570]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:30:58.770 --> 02:31:03.131]  Use since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.

[02:31:28.496 --> 02:31:29.496]  Alex Jones here.
[02:31:29.496 --> 02:31:38.778]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.

[02:31:58.223 --> 02:31:59.164]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:31:59.164 --> 02:31:59.725]  Good, brother.
[02:31:59.725 --> 02:32:01.687]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:32:01.687 --> 02:32:03.409]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:32:03.409 --> 02:32:07.433]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:32:07.433 --> 02:32:08.194]  Well, thank you, brother.
[02:32:08.194 --> 02:32:12.479]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:32:12.479 --> 02:32:20.347]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:32:20.647 --> 02:32:23.891]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[02:32:23.891 --> 02:32:25.433]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:32:25.433 --> 02:32:30.118]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, saving a ton of money there.
[02:32:30.118 --> 02:32:35.384]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[02:32:35.384 --> 02:32:36.184]  We're good to go.
[02:33:00.345 --> 02:33:05.647]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:33:05.647 --> 02:33:14.831]  Homeland security begins with hometown security.
[02:33:14.831 --> 02:33:24.815]  It seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets, which may make scarring particularly difficult, even with this year's rule changes.
[02:33:24.815 --> 02:33:28.237]  To recap those revisions, women
[02:33:29.540 --> 02:33:33.863]  ...are still worth 10 points more than men in all age brackets.
[02:33:33.863 --> 02:33:42.628]  But teenagers now rack up 40 points, and toddlers under 12 now rate a big 70 points.
[02:33:42.628 --> 02:33:52.553]  The big score, anyone, any sex, over 75 years old, has been upped to 100 points.
[02:33:52.553 --> 02:33:58.477]  As always, how fast you move determines how long you live.
[02:34:02.654 --> 02:34:06.781]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:34:06.781 --> 02:34:08.443]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:34:24.628 --> 02:34:27.350]  You know, he had a best-selling film come out a few years ago.
[02:34:27.350 --> 02:34:28.691]  I think it's now more important than ever.
[02:34:28.691 --> 02:34:35.476]  We sell it as well as his latest film, Utopia, about the Obama nightmare at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:34:35.476 --> 02:34:52.589]  You really should get it and give it to your friends and family because now you've got congressmen and others coming out pointing out Frank Marshall Davis and a video clip of Obama talking about Frank Marshall Davis, teaching him basically his world views.
[02:34:53.956 --> 02:35:03.924]  So for an update on this, Joel Gilbert's going to be joining us and he just told us he's doing an interview tonight with major breaking news with worldnetdaily.com.
[02:35:03.924 --> 02:35:05.445]  We'll have the story obviously tomorrow.
[02:35:05.445 --> 02:35:11.069]  I want to invite Joel to pop back in for 10 minutes, 15 minutes tomorrow to tell us what this big breaking news is.
[02:35:11.069 --> 02:35:12.811]  Maybe he can give us a little taste of it.
[02:35:12.811 --> 02:35:16.414]  He just talked to one of Obama's relatives and has been tight on the case.
[02:35:17.520 --> 02:35:25.583]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip of Obama talking about one of the main communist publishers hooked in with the KGB, you name it.
[02:35:25.583 --> 02:35:31.246]  Major newspaper publisher throughout the country of communist official newspapers.
[02:35:31.246 --> 02:35:33.007]  Went to Cuba, Russia, you name it.
[02:35:33.007 --> 02:35:36.948]  Frank Marshall Davis, who was also a famous pornographer.
[02:35:36.948 --> 02:35:43.511]  And clearly Joel got in the private collection of someone and shows his mother there at the house in porn with him.
[02:35:43.511 --> 02:35:45.172]  And this is where Obama grew up.
[02:35:46.581 --> 02:35:50.202]  And his grandfather was, you know, best friends with this guy that's his dad.
[02:35:50.202 --> 02:35:53.563]  So the whole Kenya thing was a distraction.
[02:35:53.563 --> 02:35:58.244]  That's why he said in the Harvard Law Review that he was the editor of, that he was from Kenya over and over again.
[02:35:58.244 --> 02:36:04.305]  I mean, in the official intro, I'm so honored to be from, born in Kenya, to be here now at Harvard and shows you can advance.
[02:36:04.305 --> 02:36:06.686]  His wife said he was from Kenya in speeches.
[02:36:06.686 --> 02:36:10.487]  Because they were scared to death of the Frank Marshall Davis issue.
[02:36:10.487 --> 02:36:15.448]  Then they put out fake birth certificates, you name it, to make us get on the case knowing they were fake.
[02:36:16.530 --> 02:36:22.194]  With the fake typewriter font, where the C's, the D's, the A's, the Z's, everything's the same.
[02:36:22.194 --> 02:36:24.696]  The fake blobs of the ink are exactly the same.
[02:36:24.696 --> 02:36:25.296]  It's fake!
[02:36:25.296 --> 02:36:25.877]  It's fake!
[02:36:25.877 --> 02:36:26.417]  It's fake!
[02:36:26.417 --> 02:36:27.018]  Period!
[02:36:27.018 --> 02:36:28.699]  Fake!
[02:36:28.699 --> 02:36:29.920]  That's a fraud right there.
[02:36:29.920 --> 02:36:31.141]  So it's still a fraud.
[02:36:31.141 --> 02:36:33.322]  But it's Frank Marshall Davis' son.
[02:36:33.322 --> 02:36:38.086]  You've got to get the film at InfoWarsStore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:36:38.086 --> 02:36:44.050]  But now this new video, and it's up on InfoWars.com, of Obama talking about learning
[02:36:45.168 --> 02:36:50.158]  How to Obsess Over Race and Everything from Frank Marshall Davis.
[02:36:50.158 --> 02:36:54.326]  Video Obama Admits Noted Communist Schooled Him on White Racism.
[02:36:54.326 --> 02:36:55.368]  Gateway Pundit.
[02:36:55.368 --> 02:36:56.731]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:36:56.731 --> 02:36:57.151]  Here's the clip.
[02:36:58.712 --> 02:37:15.255]  The passage finally ends with me having a conversation with a close friend of my maternal grandfather, a close friend of Graham's, a black man from Kansas named Frank, actually at the time a fairly well-known poet named Frank Marshall Davis who had moved to Hawaii and lived there.
[02:37:15.255 --> 02:37:25.997]  And so I have a discussion with him about the kinds of frustrations I'm having and he sort of schools me on that I should get used to these frustrations.
[02:37:25.997 --> 02:37:27.837]  So let me dig in.
[02:37:28.618 --> 02:37:33.585]  And he's such a communist now though, he tells Africans they can't have air conditioning or a car.
[02:37:33.585 --> 02:37:35.949]  As he rolls around like the richest king on earth.
[02:37:37.300 --> 02:37:40.021]  But bows every other king or queen he sees.
[02:37:40.021 --> 02:37:46.584]  I mean, it's just as they push communist ideology from the piles of gold they've stolen.
[02:37:46.584 --> 02:37:52.466]  So, Joel Gilbert, Dreams of My Real Father, we'll play some video of this in the background for TV viewers.
[02:37:52.466 --> 02:37:54.907]  Story of Reds and the Deception.
[02:37:54.907 --> 02:37:56.528]  I tell you, how amazing.
[02:37:56.528 --> 02:37:59.709]  Suddenly, Frank Marshall Davis is getting a lot of attention.
[02:37:59.709 --> 02:38:00.830]  So, kudos there.
[02:38:00.830 --> 02:38:04.031]  We salute you on your groundbreaking research, Joel.
[02:38:05.253 --> 02:38:06.795]  Thanks, great to be back with you.
[02:38:06.795 --> 02:38:21.168]  You know, my film, Dreams for My Real Father, this came out in 2012, and it's just fascinating to me to watch how long it takes for people to really pay attention and realize that it's coming out more and more.
[02:38:21.168 --> 02:38:24.352]  The influence of Frank Marshall Davis is undeniable.
[02:38:24.352 --> 02:38:27.695]  He had a profound ideological impact, and I can talk about that.
[02:38:28.382 --> 02:38:37.727]  But all the research is in, and I think I've convinced a lot of people and demonstrated that Frank Marshall Davis was Barack Obama's real biological father.
[02:38:37.727 --> 02:38:38.107]  It's her!
[02:38:38.107 --> 02:38:40.148]  She did lesbian porn, everything!
[02:38:40.148 --> 02:38:40.808]  Yeah.
[02:38:40.808 --> 02:38:43.530]  And he then became his ideological mentor.
[02:38:43.530 --> 02:38:44.871]  There's absolutely no question.
[02:38:44.871 --> 02:38:45.411]  He says it!
[02:38:46.536 --> 02:39:05.063]  The Kenya story is simply a cover story because he knows Americans would be uncomfortable if he said, my father was a Soviet agent who indoctrinated me into the Marxist ideology and I am wanting to come and live in the White House so I can help spread this all over the country.
[02:39:05.063 --> 02:39:06.164]  That wouldn't work.
[02:39:06.164 --> 02:39:06.944]  So he had to say,
[02:39:07.584 --> 02:39:11.608]  My father was a goat herder from Kenya, and I'm going to bring people together.
[02:39:11.608 --> 02:39:15.252]  So the reality is that Obama is what we call a red diaper baby.
[02:39:15.252 --> 02:39:18.815]  This means the child of a Communist Party USA member.
[02:39:18.815 --> 02:39:24.861]  And I want to tell you, Davis was not only a Communist Party member, he was a Communist propagandist.
[02:39:24.861 --> 02:39:27.503]  And he also acted as a Soviet agent.
[02:39:27.503 --> 02:39:29.365]  People don't understand this.
[02:39:29.365 --> 02:39:31.507]  He went from Chicago to Hawaii in 1948.
[02:39:33.306 --> 02:39:42.258]  On the orders of the Kremlin to help start a strike and organize the dock workers with the goal of taking over the Hawaiian government and expelling U.S.
[02:39:42.258 --> 02:39:43.019]  naval forces.
[02:39:43.019 --> 02:39:46.384]  And he had massive funding and was able to start major newspapers, you name it.
[02:39:47.113 --> 02:39:47.974]  That's correct.
[02:39:47.974 --> 02:39:51.016]  So first, he started a strike for six months.
[02:39:51.016 --> 02:39:53.158]  The goal was to get rid of U.S.
[02:39:53.158 --> 02:39:56.421]  naval forces and allow for Soviet expansion in Asia.
[02:39:56.421 --> 02:40:02.726]  The strike he organized eventually failed, and he went on to become a communist propagandist and writer for years.
[02:40:02.726 --> 02:40:04.988]  And then as you can see, in 1960, he fathered the
[02:40:08.250 --> 02:40:31.670]  Current President of the United States who has hidden this background and that's the profound manipulation of the electorate is he tried to make people think his family was from Kenya rather than the reality that he was a radical and the child of a Communist Party member and he was indoctrinated into this ideology which calls for the elimination of the United States.
[02:40:32.330 --> 02:40:33.651]  And we played into it, you didn't.
[02:40:33.651 --> 02:40:38.273]  And I want to go back briefly, this is so incredibly new info, on how you, with others, discovered this.
[02:40:38.273 --> 02:40:40.274]  I mean, really, you deserve a Pulitzer Prize for this.
[02:40:40.274 --> 02:40:43.195]  I'm not just kissing your butt, I don't say that to a lot of our guests.
[02:40:43.195 --> 02:40:45.376]  Because I even bought a hook, line, and sinker.
[02:40:45.376 --> 02:40:48.758]  It was designed for me and Dr. Corsi and others.
[02:40:48.758 --> 02:40:57.622]  Because, I mean, look, he says in the Harvard Review, every issue, you know, hey, I'm the editor, I came from Kenya, was born there, it's amazing I could be here.
[02:40:57.622 --> 02:41:00.984]  You know, he says it in literature, he does it in book proposals.
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:03.061]  He does it.
[02:41:03.061 --> 02:41:04.862]  His wife says it in speeches in 2007.
[02:41:04.862 --> 02:41:07.844]  And then we're just going, it's a fake birth certificate.
[02:41:07.844 --> 02:41:09.445]  You say you're from Kenya.
[02:41:09.445 --> 02:41:10.445]  We're being attacked.
[02:41:10.445 --> 02:41:15.108]  The media will never play the clips of why we're saying he's from Kenya.
[02:41:15.108 --> 02:41:16.669]  And then the whole thing was a setup.
[02:41:16.669 --> 02:41:21.392]  He was really the son of one of the top communist agents in the US.
[02:41:21.392 --> 02:41:25.715]  And then his grandfather was admittedly CIA and his mother a sex operative.
[02:41:25.715 --> 02:41:29.657]  I mean, you can't make that up.
[02:41:29.657 --> 02:41:29.837]  It's a...
[02:41:31.608 --> 02:41:36.550]  The saddest, the sadder story is that America was deceived.
[02:41:36.550 --> 02:41:42.712]  People sent their kids to the army, people worked all their lives to protect the right to vote.
[02:41:42.712 --> 02:41:47.274]  And people went and voted in an election with a complete deception.
[02:41:47.274 --> 02:41:52.376]  Obama lied about his personal background, but he also lied about his political goals.
[02:41:52.376 --> 02:41:54.617]  He said Obamacare is not a tax.
[02:41:54.617 --> 02:41:56.658]  I'm going to cut the deficit in half.
[02:41:56.658 --> 02:41:58.678]  He never intended to do any of these things.
[02:41:58.678 --> 02:41:59.979]  It was a complete lie
[02:42:00.599 --> 02:42:11.288]  Following the ideology to use a big lie to take power, and then once you take power, use the tools of state, like the IRS, the control of information, to keep a permanent hold on power.
[02:42:11.288 --> 02:42:14.471]  So the tragedy is far beyond Obama's family.
[02:42:14.471 --> 02:42:20.416]  It's what has happened to the United States, and how he's degrading our relationships and our allies around the world.
[02:42:21.236 --> 02:42:25.261]  The United States cannot exist in the world as a lone democracy between two oceans.
[02:42:25.261 --> 02:42:35.793]  We need strong allies who share our values in Western Europe, Israel, Australia, Japan, and he's used the power of state to degrade our alliances worldwide.
[02:42:36.013 --> 02:42:39.074]  He won't let us have one gold mine, one copper mine.
[02:42:39.074 --> 02:42:41.555]  He's shutting down power plants every week.
[02:42:41.555 --> 02:42:43.095]  China's opening new ones.
[02:42:43.095 --> 02:42:44.556]  He's raising taxes.
[02:42:44.556 --> 02:42:48.277]  He's opening the borders completely, saying we'll pay for everybody free.
[02:42:48.277 --> 02:42:50.438]  I mean, he is destroying the country.
[02:42:50.438 --> 02:42:54.039]  I just can't believe that the elite are allowing him to do this.
[02:42:54.039 --> 02:42:59.461]  Because, I mean, the elite are corrupt, but man, I mean, is this a communist double-cross of the robber barons?
[02:42:59.461 --> 02:43:00.021]  What's going on?
[02:43:00.697 --> 02:43:03.738]  Well, Obama's election was not a sudden political phenomenon.
[02:43:03.738 --> 02:43:09.641]  It really was the result of an American socialist movement that has been quietly infiltrating the U.S.
[02:43:09.641 --> 02:43:13.903]  economy, media, entertainment for decades.
[02:43:13.903 --> 02:43:22.566]  So Obama was able to take power with the cover of all these people, simply the media, rather than investigate his story.
[02:43:22.566 --> 02:43:26.348]  I've been to Hawaii twice, which is twice as much as all the media combined.
[02:43:27.308 --> 02:43:29.270]  Uh, they simply repeated his story.
[02:43:29.270 --> 02:43:30.851]  My father's a goat herder from Kenya.
[02:43:30.851 --> 02:43:32.452]  I'm going to bring people together.
[02:43:32.452 --> 02:43:38.477]  The reality, he should have said, which they would have brought if they even asked him, is what was your relationship with Frank Marshall Davis?
[02:43:38.477 --> 02:43:40.299]  What was the impact on you?
[02:43:40.299 --> 02:43:49.947]  Why did you follow in his footsteps all the way back to Chicago, where you teamed up with your real father's buddy, Vernon Jarrett, the father-in-law of
[02:43:50.723 --> 02:43:53.145]  Valerie Jarrett working for a communist newspaper.
[02:43:53.145 --> 02:43:57.387]  And of course his dad had been in Chicago, right, and actually started that newspaper, didn't he?
[02:43:57.387 --> 02:44:00.289]  Well, Frank Marshall Davis was a Chicago journalist.
[02:44:00.289 --> 02:44:06.273]  He joined the Communist Party in 1932, only 15 years after the Bolshevik Revolution.
[02:44:06.273 --> 02:44:07.314]  He was one of the original
[02:44:08.144 --> 02:44:10.726]  Black Bolsheviks, along with Paul Robeson.
[02:44:10.726 --> 02:44:18.292]  And the communists manipulated journalists and black people into thinking that if you follow communism, we'll eliminate racism.
[02:44:18.292 --> 02:44:22.115]  They didn't realize that if you follow communism, you eliminate everybody.
[02:44:23.476 --> 02:44:33.045]  Not just racism, but everyone becomes impoverished and the societies end up decaying biologically and economically.
[02:44:33.045 --> 02:44:40.471]  So Davis was one of the original black Bolsheviks, and as I said, he acted on behalf of the Soviet Union as a Soviet agent, went to Hawaii.
[02:44:41.232 --> 02:44:45.414]  How profound is it that the President of the United States is the son of a Soviet agent?
[02:44:45.414 --> 02:44:56.678]  And don't think that the Kremlin and the Russians don't know who Obama is, and they would not use that against him, knowing that he's keeping such a profound secret.
[02:44:56.678 --> 02:45:04.702]  And that's why certain elements of the CIA and the Ford Foundation that's helped fund him his whole life like him there too, because they can use that and control him as well.
[02:45:05.523 --> 02:45:09.885]  Yeah, the President of the United States cannot have a big secret like this.
[02:45:09.885 --> 02:45:15.967]  We know that Bill Clinton was speaking to Monica Lewinsky from a cell phone from the White House.
[02:45:15.967 --> 02:45:24.930]  And there's no doubt that that could easily have been intercepted by Chinese agents, other foreign agents, and used against the President as blackmail.
[02:45:24.930 --> 02:45:31.553]  So Obama has set himself up and set up the whole country with this false narrative that he's the son of a Kenyan goat herder.
[02:45:32.233 --> 02:45:42.887]  When in fact he's a red diaper baby of the son of a radical American communist who taught him and indoctrinated him into a radical ideology.
[02:45:42.887 --> 02:45:48.154]  And I think in my film I show that he followed in his father's footsteps to Occidental to study with Marxist professors.
[02:45:49.039 --> 02:45:53.322]  He went to New York to go to socialist scholars conferences.
[02:45:53.322 --> 02:46:03.028]  He hooked up with Bill Ayers and went to Chicago, back where his father started in the communist movement, and Obama became a trainer for ten years for Acorn.
[02:46:03.028 --> 02:46:05.329]  You can see the whole thing.
[02:46:05.329 --> 02:46:06.230]  Let me ask you this.
[02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:09.312]  You're a really smart guy, and I respect your opinion, Joel Gilbert.
[02:46:09.312 --> 02:46:10.433]  The filmmaker joins us.
[02:46:10.433 --> 02:46:12.174]  I get dreams from my real father.
[02:46:12.174 --> 02:46:15.296]  And there's No Place Like Utopia, both available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:46:15.856 --> 02:46:16.996]  We're on his side as well.
[02:46:16.996 --> 02:46:20.638]  Just support the filmmaker, support this operation as well.
[02:46:20.638 --> 02:46:21.938]  Show this to your friends and family.
[02:46:21.938 --> 02:46:23.619]  I mean, if this doesn't wake them up, nothing will.
[02:46:23.619 --> 02:46:33.142]  It really wakes a lot of people up when they see the irrefutable evidence that his dad is a communist agent or pornographer and that his mom is in lesbo porn.
[02:46:33.142 --> 02:46:35.102]  You know, it just shows how compromised he is.
[02:46:35.102 --> 02:46:38.843]  Forget the moral judgment about the stuff, just that alone.
[02:46:38.843 --> 02:46:39.644]  Let me ask you this.
[02:46:39.644 --> 02:46:41.184]  How do you think Obama's doing?
[02:46:41.184 --> 02:46:43.405]  What do you think he'll try in his last two years in office?
[02:46:44.665 --> 02:46:45.986]  Where do you see this country going?
[02:46:45.986 --> 02:46:53.872]  Because I don't see them not going for broke as bad as he really is.
[02:46:53.872 --> 02:47:02.298]  Just like his other predecessors in the Weather Underground and SDS, don't forget Bill Ayers became a mentor later.
[02:47:02.298 --> 02:47:07.422]  In 1969, Bernardine Dorn, with the Weather Underground, declared war on the United States.
[02:47:07.422 --> 02:47:10.845]  I think Obama is taking a chapter out of that book
[02:47:11.545 --> 02:47:17.187]  And he is declaring war on the United States without actually saying it.
[02:47:17.187 --> 02:47:19.528]  Just like they had a war against the cops.
[02:47:19.528 --> 02:47:20.828]  Kill the cops.
[02:47:20.828 --> 02:47:22.809]  This was the mantra back in the late 60s.
[02:47:22.809 --> 02:47:28.311]  George Soros again, 33 million to fund the people chanting kill the cops.
[02:47:28.311 --> 02:47:29.051]  What is their endgame?
[02:47:29.531 --> 02:47:31.214]  This is the original movement.
[02:47:31.214 --> 02:47:36.821]  All you have to do is look back to the communist movement of the Weather Underground, Prairie Fire.
[02:47:36.821 --> 02:47:44.873]  The goal is to eliminate the American middle class and destroy the foundation of the capitalist system.
[02:47:44.873 --> 02:47:45.574]  They know that
[02:47:46.488 --> 02:47:50.649]  Church-going, hard-working people will never buy into this progressive nonsense.
[02:47:50.649 --> 02:48:12.834]  So their goal has always been to eliminate the middle class, raise taxes, give away their health care to poor and illegals, flood the country with immigrants, degrade our position abroad, do everything they can to eliminate the foundation of what supports the free market system, and that is the only threat to their having a permanent hold on power.
[02:48:12.834 --> 02:48:14.995]  The goal is to keep a permanent hold on power.
[02:48:16.064 --> 02:48:17.645]  And Cloward and Piven's almost here.
[02:48:17.645 --> 02:48:20.067]  We've been maneuvered towards total bankruptcy.
[02:48:20.067 --> 02:48:20.727]  We're beyond that.
[02:48:20.727 --> 02:48:21.848]  They just haven't pulled the plug yet.
[02:48:21.848 --> 02:48:23.749]  They've dumbed the kids down.
[02:48:23.749 --> 02:48:27.671]  They are just distracting us with every crazy issue you can imagine.
[02:48:27.671 --> 02:48:30.913]  The great Commissar Michelle tells our kids what to eat.
[02:48:30.913 --> 02:48:36.197]  Joel, I know you've got a big breaking news story that'll be out tonight or tomorrow at World Net Daily.
[02:48:36.197 --> 02:48:38.158]  Can you tell us what it pertains to?
[02:48:38.158 --> 02:48:40.299]  Yeah, I'll give you a hint.
[02:48:40.299 --> 02:48:41.060]  I've developed
[02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:54.461]  Relationships over the last year or two with close Obama confidants and relatives and I will be dropping a major interview with a major Obama family member
[02:48:56.125 --> 02:49:01.426]  Tonight, and you should see it tomorrow on WorldNet Daily, unless there's any delay, but that is the expectation.
[02:49:01.426 --> 02:49:12.168]  And there will be very profound new light shed on the issue of Frank Marshall Davis, as well as Obama's relationship with the Kenyan family.
[02:49:12.168 --> 02:49:19.530]  People, if you read the news, you kind of get the picture that Obama made a very big deal out of the Kenyan connection, out of all these relatives.
[02:49:20.774 --> 02:49:21.874]  In order to get elected.
[02:49:21.874 --> 02:49:27.497]  Once he was in office, he never talks about them again and never has anything to do with them.
[02:49:27.497 --> 02:49:36.940]  And the Kenyan Obamas have been paying attention to this and wondering why this strange, strange behavior.
[02:49:36.940 --> 02:49:39.721]  His whole life, he actually interacted with them a lot.
[02:49:39.721 --> 02:49:41.842]  He visited Kenya several times.
[02:49:41.842 --> 02:49:43.823]  He hosted the Kenyan relatives.
[02:49:43.823 --> 02:49:48.804]  And once he achieved the presidency, all of a sudden, you never hear about them.
[02:49:48.804 --> 02:49:49.845]  Nor do they hear from him.
[02:49:50.345 --> 02:49:53.127]  And we're going to find out tomorrow what's really going on.
[02:49:53.127 --> 02:49:59.973]  If it does break tomorrow, please come back on for another 20 minutes, Joel Gilbert, because I know if you're saying it's really important, it's going to be big.
[02:49:59.973 --> 02:50:00.834]  Absolutely.
[02:50:00.834 --> 02:50:01.114]  All right.
[02:50:01.114 --> 02:50:03.756]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:50:03.756 --> 02:50:08.620]  Again, folks can go to his website and get his films or go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:50:08.620 --> 02:50:11.523]  Dreams from My Real Father and There's No Place Like Utopia.
[02:50:11.523 --> 02:50:15.947]  Dreams from My Real Father was a huge blockbuster online and in DVD sales.
[02:50:17.467 --> 02:50:34.254]  It's been a big seller as well, Dreams of My Real Father, but I mean, nothing, the new film, nothing compared to that from what I've seen, and I think it's even a better film and more powerful film overall, just about the collectivism and what it's actually done to black communities and others.
[02:50:34.254 --> 02:50:39.977]  There's No Place Like Utopia is available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:50:39.977 --> 02:50:42.058]  You need to get that film, not just to support us.
[02:50:42.958 --> 02:50:47.283]  This information the system doesn't want you to see, you have it, and you can show it to others.
[02:50:47.283 --> 02:50:55.012]  That's how we're going to change things, is waking people up that Obama is a total fiction, a fraud, and is being blackmailed by criminal globalist interests.
[02:50:55.012 --> 02:50:56.694]  So get both the films and fullerstore.com.

[02:51:52.078 --> 02:51:53.159]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:51:53.159 --> 02:51:55.582]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds.
[02:51:55.582 --> 02:51:58.966]  I lift weights five days a week.
[02:52:06.255 --> 02:52:07.897]  I could swim two, three miles.
[02:52:07.897 --> 02:52:11.060]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[02:52:11.060 --> 02:52:13.022]  I started an access television show.
[02:52:13.022 --> 02:52:18.427]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[02:52:18.427 --> 02:52:21.270]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[02:52:21.790 --> 02:52:27.857]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut.
[02:52:27.857 --> 02:52:33.123]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[02:52:33.123 --> 02:52:38.289]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[02:52:38.289 --> 02:52:39.751]  When I added to the mix

[02:53:34.901 --> 02:53:40.806]  I just wanted to send you a quick but a very big thank you for Heart and Body Extract.
[02:53:40.806 --> 02:53:48.934]  I've been on the formula for nearly a month now, and the improvement in the circulation of my legs has been simply amazing.
[02:53:48.934 --> 02:53:50.556]  Reed was facing a tough choice.
[02:53:50.896 --> 02:53:57.802]  I was facing surgery due to the severity of a 100% blocked artery in both my legs.
[02:54:19.921 --> 02:54:24.324]  Man, I don't know who's running the traffic up there at GCN, but the ads have been scrambled.
[02:54:24.324 --> 02:54:26.766]  I'm going to start talking about this on air.
[02:54:26.766 --> 02:54:28.627]  My God almighty.
[02:54:28.627 --> 02:54:34.311]  People better take me for serious, that's all I gotta say.
[02:54:34.311 --> 02:54:36.693]  I'm not trying to run an amateur operation around here.
[02:54:36.693 --> 02:54:42.837]  My crew's doing an excellent job, so is John Harmon.
[02:54:42.837 --> 02:54:44.678]  But I did not shoot the sheriff, I shot the deputy.
[02:54:51.229 --> 02:54:53.871]  My temper is one of my best assets, but it's also one of my worst.
[02:54:53.871 --> 02:54:55.753]  Please, God, help me calm down now.
[02:54:55.753 --> 02:55:02.158]  DHS to purchase 62 million rounds of AR-15 ammo.
[02:55:02.158 --> 02:55:05.060]  Feds attempting to control the market, dry up supply.
[02:55:05.060 --> 02:55:08.723]  And the article has now been beefed up.
[02:55:08.723 --> 02:55:10.785]  It's on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:55:10.785 --> 02:55:14.888]  It's going extremely viral right now.

[02:55:20.166 --> 02:55:25.069]  Another 62 million rounds of AR-15 ammo.
[02:55:25.069 --> 02:55:29.731]  For Homeland Security, not the military.
[02:55:29.731 --> 02:55:37.376]  They claim it's for the Border Patrol, even though they're rationing the Border Patrol and not letting them have it.
[02:55:37.376 --> 02:55:46.441]  But of course, experts have told Michael Savage and others that it's actually a plan to shut off the general public being able to have access to it and cause shortages, which has already happened.
[02:55:47.950 --> 02:55:51.072]  And they've also called for the ATF to do similar things.
[02:55:51.072 --> 02:55:53.693]  We've got a breakdown just on the FedBizOpps site.
[02:55:53.693 --> 02:55:55.994]  There's a bunch of other places they get the ammo.
[02:55:55.994 --> 02:55:56.134]  It's $2,118,000,000.
[02:56:00.908 --> 02:56:12.434]  Rounds of bullets, 40 cal, 7.6239, 9mm, .357 SIG, .308 Remington, 12 gauge .357 SIG, and .223 Remington.
[02:56:12.434 --> 02:56:17.676]  But I know about a bunch of big purchases that are hundreds of other weird calibers, so that's just some of what Kit found.
[02:56:17.676 --> 02:56:18.357]  It's way over that.
[02:56:19.707 --> 02:56:23.611]  That's enough ammo that we just showed to kill around 30% of the world's population.
[02:56:23.611 --> 02:56:24.392]  Furthermore, U.S.
[02:56:24.392 --> 02:56:31.319]  soldiers were shooting around 5.5 million rounds of ammunition per month during the Iraq War, 66 million rounds annually.
[02:56:31.319 --> 02:56:35.463]  Using that figure, the feds have stockpiled enough ammo the past two years to fight a 32-year war.
[02:56:38.721 --> 02:56:44.123]  And, uh, that story is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:56:44.123 --> 02:56:46.904]  Let's make sure we update the PrisonPlanet.com article as well.
[02:56:46.904 --> 02:56:49.184]  We got it on our Facebook, Twitter, RealAlexJones.
[02:56:49.184 --> 02:56:51.325]  Please retweet it.
[02:56:51.325 --> 02:56:52.445]  You have the power.
[02:56:52.445 --> 02:57:00.448]  The system is doing everything it can to shut us down, to shut you down, and to kill memes, and to not let us dominate.
[02:57:00.448 --> 02:57:02.388]  We're still getting bigger moving forward.
[02:57:02.388 --> 02:57:08.110]  But, I mean, we gotta get a lot bigger to really blow up the Death Star politically.
[02:57:09.066 --> 02:57:11.008]  But we're not the only operation out there.
[02:57:11.008 --> 02:57:12.269]  I mean, we're bringing the enemy down.
[02:57:12.269 --> 02:57:12.910]  We're hurting them bad.
[02:57:12.910 --> 02:57:14.291]  That's why they're moving so quick right now.
[02:57:14.291 --> 02:57:15.572]  They're trying to play catch up.
[02:57:15.572 --> 02:57:20.537]  But I'm just not here to do this in half measures and go half speed.
[02:57:20.537 --> 02:57:21.238]  I'll be honest.
[02:57:21.238 --> 02:57:27.384]  I went probably 95 speed until about 10 years ago.
[02:57:27.384 --> 02:57:31.608]  But I didn't want to be a major leader out of a thing of non-arrogance.
[02:57:33.018 --> 02:57:36.801]  And I thought kind of small, and then I saw how much success we had about ten years ago.
[02:57:36.801 --> 02:57:42.604]  I said, no, the enemy attacks me, they hate me, people want me to fail, I'm going all the way out as hard as I can.
[02:57:42.604 --> 02:57:43.625]  And you've seen what we've done.
[02:57:43.625 --> 02:57:44.966]  It's been substantive.
[02:57:44.966 --> 02:57:48.689]  It's because of you, and I salute you for what you've done out there.
[02:57:48.689 --> 02:57:49.629]  Thank you.
[02:57:49.629 --> 02:57:51.350]  Now let's kick it up a notch here!
[02:57:51.350 --> 02:57:54.432]  Let's not hope later we would have done more against these people!
[02:57:54.432 --> 02:58:00.797]  These people are outrageous criminals that openly attack gun owners, Christians, conservatives,
[02:58:01.866 --> 02:58:11.528]  And now in Army manuals yesterday, Mainstream News, Daily Caller, all of them had it, saying that the Bible, Christianity, the Constitution are sexist and racist and are evil.
[02:58:11.528 --> 02:58:14.049]  The military swears enough, the police swear enough to that.
[02:58:14.049 --> 02:58:15.289]  You think things are upside down?
[02:58:15.289 --> 02:58:16.049]  They are.
[02:58:16.049 --> 02:58:24.251]  We got a bunch of evil people trying to convince the general public, the military and the police, and the bureaucracy to go along with an upside down system.
[02:58:26.232 --> 02:58:28.433]  And if we just say no to it, boy, how ridiculous!
[02:58:28.433 --> 02:58:30.493]  It's all a con game!
[02:58:30.493 --> 02:58:31.793]  It's just hidden in plain view.
[02:58:31.793 --> 02:58:33.094]  It's outrageous!
[02:58:33.094 --> 02:58:33.974]  Great job, crew!
[02:58:33.974 --> 02:58:35.915]  Lord willing, see you back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:58:35.915 --> 02:58:41.696]  Central.
[02:58:41.696 --> 02:58:45.477]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
