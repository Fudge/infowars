[00:00:01.482 --> 00:00:06.525]  This is an engineered crisis to create artificial scarcity on the world's most valuable and simple resource.
[00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:07.345]  Water.
[00:00:08.186 --> 00:00:14.729]  People like Al Gore are constantly blaming extreme weather and natural disasters on climate change when the real culprit is weather.
[00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.211]  But in all reality, climate change is quite real.
[00:00:29.147 --> 00:00:31.709]  Hi, I'm Rex Jones reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.954]  With all the recent flooding in Central Texas, it's leading many people to believe that climate change is the real cause.
[00:00:37.414 --> 00:00:38.375]  Take a look at Barton Creek.
[00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:39.937]  This used to be a dry creek bed.
[00:00:40.037 --> 00:00:40.517]  Now look at it.
[00:00:40.717 --> 00:00:41.778]  It's flowing like a real river.
[00:00:42.018 --> 00:00:47.763]  In fact, if you take a little peek at a topography map of Texas, half of the state is green and the other half is brown.
[00:00:48.204 --> 00:00:54.990]  Here in Austin, Texas, where the Texas Hill Country begins and the Flatland ends, is a known boundary between wet and dry areas of Texas.
[00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.324]  In fact, we had so much rain here over Memorial Day weekend, my good friend Stevie Ray Vaughan was almost underwater.
[00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:10.236]  The general weather in the state of Texas can vary from snowstorms to a desert heat, but generally our climate stays the same.
[00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:17.322]  People like Al Gore are constantly blaming extreme weather and natural disasters on climate change when the real culprit is weather.
[00:01:17.482 --> 00:01:19.804]  But in all reality, climate change is quite real.
[00:01:20.024 --> 00:01:25.709]  Here's an excerpt by well-known climatologist Tim Ball as he details the effects of real climate change on the world today.
[00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:28.471]  My life has spanned four climate changes.
[00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:37.240]  I was in the pre-war warming up to 1940, and then I was in the cooling that occurred from 1940 to about 1980.
[00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:42.005]  And then I was in the warming from 80 to 98, and now we're into another cooling trend.
[00:01:42.586 --> 00:01:45.429]  And hopefully I'll live to at least one more climate change.
[00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:49.233]  When I started out, it was not a contentious issue at all.
[00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:55.696]  Now it's become one of the most contentious in the world because it's been exploited for political purposes.
[00:01:55.936 --> 00:02:02.840]  Just as we talked about with Einstein, if you were to show that there was something going faster than the speed of light would put that whole theory in jeopardy.
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:14.186]  With the anthropogenic global warming theory, the idea that a CO2 increase will cause a temperature increase is now clearly shown to be wrong.
[00:02:15.804 --> 00:02:28.870]  In fact, I challenge anybody to show me a record of any duration of any time period in the history of the Earth in which CO2 precedes a temperature increase.
[00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.731]  In fact, in every case it's the opposite.
[00:02:31.811 --> 00:02:33.772]  Temperature increases before CO2.
[00:02:34.673 --> 00:02:41.716]  And it will take, ironically, a cooling of the Earth, as is now occurring, to make people start to question.
[00:02:42.586 --> 00:02:52.594]  And so eventually the people will start to understand how bad the science is, how wrong the original theory was, and the whole thing will collapse.
[00:02:53.115 --> 00:03:04.384]  Most of the crazy weather we've been having is largely blamed by meteorologists on the pattern of weather known as El Nino, which is a warm patch in the Pacific Ocean which leads to more rain in general in the United States of America.
[00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:07.987]  As you can see, we're getting the full force of El Nino this year.
[00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:13.727]  And with meteorologist saying that there's a 95% chance that it will continue on to this fall.
[00:03:14.656 --> 00:03:16.177]  We haven't seen the last of this rainy weather.
[00:03:16.817 --> 00:03:21.140]  Barton Creek feeds into Lady Bird Lake, also known as the Colorado River, behind me.
[00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:25.744]  And even though we have many dams in place, massive rainfall can still cause heavy flooding.
[00:03:26.044 --> 00:03:31.668]  People like Al Gore and the Pope are claiming, yet again, that climate change is caused by human activity.
[00:03:31.888 --> 00:03:34.189]  How about we have a real scientist talk about the issues?
[00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:39.393]  Here's weather forecaster Pierce Corbin on what is the real biggest effector of climate change.
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:47.562]  The origin of our solar weather technique of long-range forecasting came originally from study of sunspots and a desire to predict those.
[00:03:48.163 --> 00:03:53.004]  And then I realised it was actually much more interesting to use the sun to predict the weather.
[00:03:54.084 --> 00:04:00.947]  What they found was an incredibly close correlation between what the sun was doing and changes in temperature on Earth.
[00:04:02.927 --> 00:04:08.069]  To the Harvard astrophysicists and many other scientists, the conclusion is inescapable.
[00:04:08.826 --> 00:04:11.650]  The sun is driving climate change.
[00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.472]  CO2 is irrelevant.
[00:04:14.181 --> 00:04:19.982]  Another place climate change preachers are flocking to to spread their fear porn would be California with its three-year drought.
[00:04:20.122 --> 00:04:26.163]  This doesn't seem that big compared to 200 and 400 and even thousand year droughts that have happened in California's past.
[00:04:26.623 --> 00:04:33.405]  The real problem with California is that it hasn't provided adequate enough reservoirs to supply water to the tens of millions of people that live there today.
[00:04:33.605 --> 00:04:39.526]  This is an engineered crisis to create artificial scarcity on the world's most valuable and simple resource, water.
[00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:45.127]  But the place where climate change preachers can do real damage is in trade agreements such as the TPP.
[00:04:45.327 --> 00:04:51.529]  The TPP is going to put no environmental restrictions whatsoever on third-world developing countries, allowing them to develop freely.
[00:04:51.829 --> 00:05:01.832]  This doesn't sound like such a bad thing, but well-developed countries will be shackled to the ideals of environmentalism and be forced to have very strict, almost insane environmental regulations.
[00:05:02.252 --> 00:05:09.334]  So when people start preaching to you about Bill Nye, Al Gore, and the Pope telling us that climate change is all our fault, just tell them that they're complaining about the weather.
[00:05:10.156 --> 00:05:12.193]  I'm Rex Jones reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:21.914 --> 00:05:30.061]  About a year and a half ago, Anthony Gucciardi just said, man, I just did a Dr. Gribbs liver cleanse, the one he recommends, and he's developing this proprietary stuff he's testing on himself right now.
[00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:30.902]  You really ought to do it.
[00:05:31.002 --> 00:05:32.884]  The results are dramatic after six days.
[00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:34.845]  I'm like, no way, no way I'm doing it.
[00:05:34.965 --> 00:05:38.148]  I don't believe that there's giant black or green balls in my gallbladder.
[00:05:38.168 --> 00:05:39.189]  This is how ignorant I am.
[00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:40.430]  And he's like, look at it online.
[00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.591]  I'm not looking at it online.
[00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:42.652]  Stuff like that grosses me out.
[00:05:42.672 --> 00:05:43.313]  I don't want to go there.
[00:05:43.333 --> 00:05:45.955]  Well, finally, about six months ago, they convinced me to do it.
[00:05:46.055 --> 00:05:50.218]  I personally think everybody should go through liver cleansing if you haven't done one.
[00:05:50.258 --> 00:05:51.559]  Results speak for themselves.
[00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:59.044]  I mean hundreds of thousands of people have done this and it dates back even a thousand years drinking oils to cleanse and purge the liver.
[00:05:59.545 --> 00:06:04.368]  Actually the Greeks and the over in India with Ayurvedic medicine have done it the same way.
[00:06:04.428 --> 00:06:11.293]  But how it works is what you should do and this is what our proprietary research led us to do back starting in the early
[00:06:11.693 --> 00:06:12.094]  I think.
[00:06:30.913 --> 00:06:31.173]  We're good
[00:06:56.926 --> 00:06:58.508]  Well known on what liver cleanses do.
[00:06:58.568 --> 00:07:00.449]  This is the best one out there from our research.
