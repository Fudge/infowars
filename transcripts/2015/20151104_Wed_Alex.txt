[00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:04.945]  Big show.
[00:00:04.945 --> 00:00:06.266]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.026]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.026 --> 00:00:09.787]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.787 --> 00:00:11.368]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.368 --> 00:00:12.708]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.708 --> 00:00:17.111]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:21.372]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.372 --> 00:00:28.496]  We've got a special report on Barack Obama we're about to air that's very important and a secret bypass.
[00:00:29.657 --> 00:00:33.759]  He's engaged in to bring in the illegals, part of a larger globalist plan.
[00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:41.442]  Then when we come back, the economic news, the geopolitical news, the political news is all incredibly important.
[00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:53.328]  James O'Keefe is back with a new undercover video where the college again discovers pocket constitutions and is assuring people that they'll shred the evil immediately and they're so sorry for the hate crime.
[00:00:54.068 --> 00:01:00.591]  Camille Paglia says that transgender mania is a symptom of the West, cultural collapse, and more.
[00:01:00.591 --> 00:01:03.613]  It's all coming up, but here's John Bowne's latest report.
[00:01:03.613 --> 00:01:12.017]  Mushrooming numbers of displaced people across the globe have now reached levels higher than at any time in recorded history.
[00:01:12.017 --> 00:01:20.682]  The New York Times reports the United Nations claims that nearly 60 million people have been driven from their homes by war and persecution.
[00:01:20.902 --> 00:01:31.308]  An unprecedented global exodus that has burdened fragile countries with waves of newcomers and littered deserts and seas with the bodies of those who died trying to reach safety.
[00:01:31.308 --> 00:01:41.674]  Europe is being transformed overnight by the sovereign decimating socialist policies spearheaded by the EU immigration invasion leading German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
[00:01:41.674 --> 00:01:47.617]  Merkel recently bent to the wave of immigration critics when she voiced support for transit zones.
[00:01:47.657 --> 00:01:48.037]  I don't know.
[00:02:04.965 --> 00:02:09.328]  A metaphor for the transformative collision course now underway.
[00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:20.135]  Meanwhile, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is attributing the source of the soft invasion of cultural devastation to billionaire George Soros and his circle of activists.
[00:02:20.135 --> 00:02:30.402]  Bloomberg reports Soros fired back, claiming Prime Minister Orban treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle.
[00:02:30.922 --> 00:02:38.991]  Soros said, our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle.
[00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:48.941]  Back in the United States, President Obama, a key member of Soros' activist circle, has been quietly pursuing a four-option plan to allow work permits to illegals.
[00:02:49.361 --> 00:03:14.775]  Regardless of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals injunction in order to review the constitutionality of Obama's DHS enforcement nullification initiatives, The Hill reports a leaked memo reveals the first option as providing EADs, or Employment Authorization Documents, or work permits, to all individuals living in the United States, including illegal aliens, visa overstayers,
[00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:16.216]  We're good to go.
[00:03:42.452 --> 00:03:42.752]  I don't know.
[00:04:03.144 --> 00:04:19.510]  Over in Europe, a carefully executed media-biased, sovereign, shocking ocean of non-naturalized immigrants with zero knowledge of the laws and culture of the new lands they are now inhabiting, demanding to be met with the promise of a new life that doesn't exist.
[00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:31.134]  The Cloward-Piven strategy to break the back of the welfare system, in turn forcing a new world order-led socialist regime offering a guaranteed annual income, is accelerating.
[00:04:31.755 --> 00:04:45.611]  2016 is shaping up to be the year President Obama completely takes the gloves off, destroying the sovereignty and ignoring the checks and balances of our government with impunity, while his European counterparts lead the way.
[00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:47.033]  John Barron for InfoWars.com
[00:04:58.655 --> 00:04:59.436]  You've heard of the U.S.
[00:04:59.436 --> 00:05:06.704]  government wasting money on studies like mountain lions on treadmills, shrimp on treadmills, and even the effects of Swedish massage on rabbits.
[00:05:06.704 --> 00:05:09.927]  This latest example of waste comes out of the Illinois EPA.
[00:05:09.927 --> 00:05:15.233]  In fact, I tweeted, state government needs nine-step anal retentive plan to compost pumpkins?
[00:05:15.233 --> 00:05:16.554]  That's right, it's all in the article.
[00:05:16.554 --> 00:05:20.398]  Illinois EPA, pumpkins must be managed to protect human health by Kit Daniels.
[00:05:20.558 --> 00:05:26.780]  And in it, you can find a link to the actual nine-step process for local cities to collect pumpkins for composting.
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.761]  Here's step two.
[00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:34.683]  Pumpkins must not be accepted from other persons, including, but not limited to, owners and operators of rented or leased residences where pumpkins were used for decorative purposes.
[00:05:34.683 --> 00:05:38.325]  Commercial haulers and other commercial, industrial, agricultural, and government operations are entities.
[00:05:38.325 --> 00:05:39.605]  How are you going to figure that out?
[00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:40.265]  Step nine.
[00:05:40.265 --> 00:05:46.928]  The transfer and ultimate disposition of pumpkins received at the collection event must comply with the agency's approval, including all conditions contained in the approval.
[00:05:47.108 --> 00:05:49.230]  Do you have your TPS report cover sheet?
[00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.753]  Did you see the memo about this?
[00:05:51.753 --> 00:05:54.616]  If you don't, then you cannot compost pumpkins in Illinois!
[00:05:54.616 --> 00:05:55.437]  Okay.
[00:05:55.437 --> 00:05:58.580]  Rob Dury reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.084]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:02.084 --> 00:06:06.849]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:07.329]  We're good.
[00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.591]  BrainForce is here.
[00:06:29.591 --> 00:06:31.791]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:36.774]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:06:36.774 --> 00:06:38.474]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[00:06:38.474 --> 00:06:40.075]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:06:40.075 --> 00:06:43.557]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:06:43.557 --> 00:06:45.538]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:06:45.538 --> 00:06:46.458]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:06:46.458 --> 00:06:47.658]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:06:47.658 --> 00:06:49.639]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:55.242]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:06:58.183 --> 00:06:58.763]  I want more candy!
[00:06:58.763 --> 00:07:00.084]  I want more video games!
[00:07:00.084 --> 00:07:00.625]  Why?
[00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:00.845]  Why?
[00:07:00.845 --> 00:07:01.005]  Why?
[00:07:28.103 --> 00:07:28.423]  I think so.
[00:08:10.177 --> 00:08:20.582]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:20.582 --> 00:08:25.364]  I tend to say this three or four times a week when the show starts, but it's true.
[00:08:25.364 --> 00:08:35.970]  The news just gets more intense, more revealing, more insane, more over-the-top, and then on the streets I see a mirror of the craziness.
[00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.271]  So it's not just media trying to be sensational,
[00:08:39.363 --> 00:08:50.546]  So many times there'll be incredible reports of just over-the-top stuff happening, but if it's what the establishment wants, they'll report it like it's a good thing.
[00:08:50.546 --> 00:08:56.508]  Child taken from parents because parents wouldn't let seven-year-old wear a dress.
[00:08:56.508 --> 00:08:57.568]  You know, stuff like that.
[00:08:57.568 --> 00:09:05.150]  Or, school gives children inoculations without parents' consent.
[00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.531]  Or, school watches children at home on their laptops.
[00:09:11.826 --> 00:09:15.187]  No one gets in trouble.
[00:09:15.187 --> 00:09:18.748]  And today, it is just completely over the top.
[00:09:18.748 --> 00:09:22.529]  There's a InfoWars.com story that's up on DrugsReport.com.
[00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:27.971]  Verizon begins scanning and censoring customer emails with political correctness.
[00:09:27.971 --> 00:09:39.494]  They read your emails with computers, NSA-style keyword, and then it won't let you send words that are politically incorrect or things it considers to be illegal.
[00:09:40.441 --> 00:09:50.043]  Now remember, this is the government systems interface with major phone company, controlling what you say and what you do.
[00:09:50.043 --> 00:10:06.946]  And remember, just last week, the Chinese government, Facebook and others came out and said they were looking at censoring your post in live time, not even letting you post it to be removed.
[00:10:08.095 --> 00:10:10.556]  Huge news, InfoWars.com.
[00:10:10.556 --> 00:10:13.297]  And it ties in with this Forbes article.
[00:10:13.297 --> 00:10:22.440]  Microsoft admits Windows 10 automatic spying cannot be stopped.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.041]  And they just admit everything you do is being spied on.
[00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:25.881]  We're going to cover that.
[00:10:25.881 --> 00:10:28.122]  This is literally two articles
[00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:35.524]  Out of more than 150 stories I have, each one more insane than the next.
[00:10:35.524 --> 00:10:37.986]  Each one more revealing than the next.
[00:10:37.986 --> 00:10:40.188]  James O'Keefe is back with the Veritas Project.
[00:10:40.188 --> 00:10:42.691]  We're going to play this in just a few minutes.
[00:10:42.691 --> 00:10:54.102]  Not one, but two prestigious colleges caught saying, shred the Constitution, and acting like they found a 40-foot cobra in the school, and then actually shredding
[00:10:58.427 --> 00:11:00.028]  The document.
[00:11:00.028 --> 00:11:03.030]  We posted this yesterday on Infowars.com.
[00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:06.372]  World Net Daily's got their own article out today.
[00:11:06.372 --> 00:11:10.595]  College caught shredding Constitution in undercover video.
[00:11:10.595 --> 00:11:21.201]  And the reason O'Keefe did this is obviously all over the country, libertarian conservative groups try to hand out Constitutions, free ones, and they get arrested in many cases.
[00:11:21.201 --> 00:11:26.905]  And we have that famous video from squad car in Virginia from the year 2000 in my film Road to Tyranny.
[00:11:29.138 --> 00:11:42.549]  We put like six, seven minutes of it in the film, a three-hour film, for context, and there's a checkpoint, this woman with no criminal record, Navy veteran, they go, we want to search your car, and she goes, no, you can't do that without a warrant.
[00:11:42.549 --> 00:11:43.690]  I go, are you looking for a criminal?
[00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.513]  No, this is just a license check.
[00:11:46.513 --> 00:11:57.022]  So they take her out of the car, they go in the trunk, and they find a Patriot Games, a Steve Pachinick-slash-
[00:11:59.349 --> 00:12:02.731]  Tom Clancy movie.
[00:12:02.731 --> 00:12:09.236]  And the two state police start hyperventilating like they found a dead baby, a rotten baby.
[00:12:09.236 --> 00:12:11.217]  They did everything but throw up.
[00:12:11.217 --> 00:12:14.940]  And they go, we got a new Patriot, Patriot!
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.022]  And you're watching it and it's like Monty Python, but it's real.
[00:12:18.022 --> 00:12:22.846]  Then they find one of my videos.
[00:12:22.846 --> 00:12:25.107]  Police State 2000.
[00:12:25.107 --> 00:12:27.029]  Then they find a pocket constitution.
[00:12:28.837 --> 00:12:36.539]  And they start going, it's one of them, it's one of them, she's with an extremist group, is it like the Klan?
[00:12:36.539 --> 00:12:46.042]  And then the one in charge goes, that may be what she's talking about, her rights, she might be allowed to have that.
[00:12:46.042 --> 00:12:53.944]  I mean, whoa, these guys, in my view, probably had ADIQs, maybe, maybe.
[00:12:55.407 --> 00:13:01.052]  But they, and I'm serious, but they've been brought in and brainwashed to a level that was just insane.
[00:13:01.052 --> 00:13:07.497]  I mean, you show them a pocket constitution, it's like showing Count Dracula a giant silver cross at high noon.
[00:13:07.497 --> 00:13:11.640]  I mean, you're talking screaming with fear.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:17.685]  And a normal person watches this and you're like, and then you see these videos all over the country.
[00:13:17.685 --> 00:13:20.968]  And again, it's progressive police who've been put through
[00:13:22.554 --> 00:13:24.235]  The Soviet-style brainwashing.
[00:13:24.235 --> 00:13:27.936]  Most police know what's going on on this subject and are not going along with it.
[00:13:27.936 --> 00:13:43.781]  Because for those that are already half-awake, being called into a meeting and having the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, badmouth the Founding Fathers and badmouth the Gadsden flag and badmouth gun ownership and badmouth veterans and Christians and evangelicals.
[00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:45.542]  We have all the training manuals.
[00:13:45.542 --> 00:13:46.922]  We're the ones that break most of them.
[00:13:46.922 --> 00:13:48.323]  We get sent them by law enforcement.
[00:13:49.397 --> 00:13:53.561]  By peace officers, and people didn't used to believe us when we get these documents.
[00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:56.244]  Now of course it's like, yeah, everybody knows that.
[00:13:56.244 --> 00:13:57.626]  And they sit there with a straight face.
[00:13:57.626 --> 00:14:05.253]  In fact, let me just cover this first before I get into all the other no's.
[00:14:05.253 --> 00:14:08.417]  College caught shredding Constitution in undercover video.
[00:14:09.494 --> 00:14:18.662]  James O'Keefe's latest undercover video shows professors at two prestigious private universities openly disparaging and in one case shredding the U.S.
[00:14:18.662 --> 00:14:20.044]  Constitution.
[00:14:20.044 --> 00:14:30.573]  Project Veritas O'Keefe undercover journalism unit sent a female journalist disguised as a student to Vassar College in New York and to Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio.
[00:14:31.394 --> 00:14:37.119]  She got comments and commitments from leadership at each to shred the Constitution.
[00:14:37.119 --> 00:14:43.183]  And in the case of Vassar, Project Veritas undercover camera actually captured the shredding.
[00:14:43.183 --> 00:14:52.431]  Kelly Grabb, Assistant Director of Equal Opportunity at Vassar College, was captured on video saying, yes, I think we have a shredder in the front office there.
[00:14:52.431 --> 00:14:53.992]  Do you want to do it with me?
[00:14:55.916 --> 00:14:57.116]  And the woman's very excited.
[00:14:57.116 --> 00:15:00.077]  This is a religious moment to desecrate it.
[00:15:00.077 --> 00:15:10.440]  The incident unfurls when the undercover TV journalist relates her personal story of being confronted on campus with someone handing out copies of the Constitution.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:22.663]  Let's play about a minute and a half, the full unedited video of two different colleges foaming at the mouth like they again have seen... Well, I described it as a 14-foot cobra.
[00:15:23.353 --> 00:15:24.294]  40-foot cover.
[00:15:24.294 --> 00:15:39.552]  I mean, people act like a giant snake has come into their office and fanned open its head and fangs are out dripping with neurotoxin.
[00:15:39.552 --> 00:15:41.355]  This is mass mental illness.
[00:15:42.898 --> 00:15:45.000]  This is total breakdown of society.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.702]  But remember, it's not an accident.
[00:15:46.702 --> 00:15:49.706]  Now the controlled left at the top wants to go, this is really screwy.
[00:15:49.706 --> 00:15:51.267]  This is weird political correctness.
[00:15:51.267 --> 00:15:53.009]  Gee, we're going to try to do something about it.
[00:15:53.009 --> 00:15:54.010]  Our plan is working perfectly.
[00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.713]  These people are total, total Soviets.
[00:15:56.713 --> 00:15:57.374]  Let's go to the clip.
[00:15:57.374 --> 00:15:58.916]  Here it is.
[00:15:58.916 --> 00:16:02.480]  They were handing the Constitution out on campus.
[00:16:07.615 --> 00:16:13.217]  I didn't think that this would happen, but I realized that the Constitution is kind of a trigger for me.
[00:16:13.217 --> 00:16:16.277]  Overall, I see it just as a really oppressive document.
[00:16:16.277 --> 00:16:21.239]  I mean, I don't, I'm like scared to walk around campus and see the Constitution.
[00:16:21.239 --> 00:16:21.559]  Um...
[00:16:38.962 --> 00:16:44.267]  Honestly, can we just like, is there like a shredder or something?
[00:16:44.267 --> 00:16:47.370]  I think it might be like really therapeutic to see that.
[00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.072]  I think we have a shredder in the front office there.
[00:16:50.072 --> 00:16:51.954]  Did you want to do it with me?
[00:16:51.954 --> 00:16:54.957]  Yeah, I could watch.
[00:16:54.957 --> 00:16:59.541]  The Constitution in everyday life causes people pain.
[00:16:59.541 --> 00:17:01.683]  Is there a shredder that I could use?
[00:17:01.683 --> 00:17:02.504]  A shredder?
[00:17:02.504 --> 00:17:02.724]  Yeah.
[00:17:15.942 --> 00:17:19.483]  And there she goes, she shreds the Constitution.
[00:17:19.483 --> 00:17:24.445]  Which obviously isn't perfect, but the Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence are even better.
[00:17:24.445 --> 00:17:26.645]  And they're the best thing ever produced.
[00:17:26.645 --> 00:17:30.327]  Tyrants everywhere hate it, that's why they attack it constantly.
[00:17:30.327 --> 00:17:34.548]  Remember, read the Atlantic article, 28 pages, the coddling of the American mind.
[00:17:34.548 --> 00:17:40.610]  They admit that liberals, this is liberals, the top liberal publication probably in the country, after New Yorker or the New York Times.
[00:17:42.179 --> 00:17:52.502]  This is what the elitists read, admitting that their children and everyone they know are now denouncing them and are control freaks and basically have panic disorders when they see anything.
[00:17:52.502 --> 00:17:58.464]  Brown paper bags, complex words, any arguments.
[00:17:58.464 --> 00:18:01.185]  All they can do is just run around screaming in fear.
[00:18:01.185 --> 00:18:08.267]  And remember, conservative governors and legislatures in the South are banning the Confederate flag from state houses.
[00:18:08.267 --> 00:18:09.748]  They're removing the state flags.
[00:18:11.877 --> 00:18:24.868]  And they are pulling down statues, and they are arresting rednecks that drive around obnoxiously with rebel flags, and charging them with terrorism in Georgia.
[00:18:24.868 --> 00:18:29.191]  15 counts of terrorism for displaying the flag.
[00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:31.353]  With a straight face.
[00:18:31.353 --> 00:18:35.016]  Because a bunch of black people are at the park screaming, it's a threat, it's a threat!
[00:18:39.042 --> 00:19:02.667]  Now, meanwhile, we have a new video out of Salt Lake City the police say could be a hate crime and it's these drunk 20-somethings coming out of a Garth Brooks concert and a bunch of black guys come over to them with their little gangster white accomplices and start just beating them up because they have a rebel flag.
[00:19:04.927 --> 00:19:11.851]  And A, the only people wimpier than these white guys, the only people wimpier than these black guys are the white guys.
[00:19:11.851 --> 00:19:16.374]  I mean, you talk about pathetic, you talk about wimpy punches and bad kicks.
[00:19:16.374 --> 00:19:20.636]  I mean, I don't want to get in fights, but I almost dream of guys like this starting to fight with me.
[00:19:20.636 --> 00:19:27.921]  I mean, it would just be, I mean, it would be within 30 seconds they'd be crawling for their lives.
[00:19:27.921 --> 00:19:29.882]  And I mean crawling for their lives.
[00:19:30.999 --> 00:19:37.221]  I mean, it is just unbelievable to see how wimpy men are today.
[00:19:37.221 --> 00:19:41.163]  And, I mean, the white guys are just the most pathetic wimps I've ever seen.
[00:19:41.163 --> 00:19:44.644]  The black guys are like 2% less wimpy.
[00:19:44.644 --> 00:19:47.965]  I mean, this is truly pathetic.
[00:19:47.965 --> 00:19:53.147]  If that had been me, your head would have been ground to that concrete so fast, your brains would have been all over the pavement.
[00:19:53.147 --> 00:19:55.868]  You'd be lucky if you weren't on a respirator for the rest of your life.
[00:19:55.868 --> 00:19:56.469]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:56.469 --> 00:19:56.909]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.448 --> 00:20:06.089]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[00:20:06.089 --> 00:20:10.370]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:11.751]  We typically do the same thing.
[00:20:11.751 --> 00:20:14.792]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[00:20:14.792 --> 00:20:16.992]  But have you considered heat storage?
[00:20:16.992 --> 00:20:19.213]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[00:20:19.213 --> 00:20:21.494]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[00:20:21.494 --> 00:20:23.134]  How will I keep my family warm?
[00:20:23.134 --> 00:20:25.615]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[00:20:25.615 --> 00:20:29.676]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[00:20:30.518 --> 00:20:31.619]  Another concern?
[00:20:31.619 --> 00:20:35.601]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[00:20:35.601 --> 00:20:38.182]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[00:20:38.182 --> 00:20:42.165]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[00:20:42.165 --> 00:20:44.966]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[00:20:44.966 --> 00:20:49.629]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[00:20:49.629 --> 00:20:51.630]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:53.271]  FortressClothing.com.
[00:20:53.271 --> 00:20:54.612]  You'll never be cold again.
[00:20:58.699 --> 00:21:11.567]  Atmospheric aluminum, mercury exposure, estrogen toxins from plastics, microwaves from cell phones and smart meters, and low-quality foods, all combined to create conditions for the very high incidence of disease in our society.
[00:21:11.567 --> 00:21:20.072]  Now more than ever, we all need to be consuming those foods and herbs that epigenetically signal the cells of our body to produce energy, create proteins, and detoxify.
[00:21:20.072 --> 00:21:25.656]  When we properly support our bodies, then even in these toxic times, we can promote and achieve excellent health.
[00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:32.021]  One World Way is the first energetically encoded whey protein food derived from Amish pastured cows on the U.S.
[00:21:32.021 --> 00:21:32.601]  market.
[00:21:32.601 --> 00:21:36.144]  After three and a half years, we've heard miracles occur for so many people.
[00:21:36.144 --> 00:21:44.411]  One World Way has a track record of promoting detoxification, improvement in elimination, and improvements in energy, skin quality, and elimination of inflammation.
[00:21:44.451 --> 00:21:44.931]  I think so.
[00:21:58.297 --> 00:22:01.621]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[00:22:01.621 --> 00:22:07.107]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[00:22:07.107 --> 00:22:09.390]  But they're about to lose control.
[00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:14.716]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[00:22:14.716 --> 00:22:19.161]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:22:19.281 --> 00:22:21.682]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:22:21.682 --> 00:22:25.525]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[00:22:25.525 --> 00:22:30.048]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[00:22:30.048 --> 00:22:33.169]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:22:33.169 --> 00:22:35.751]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:22:35.751 --> 00:22:37.092]  This will affect us all.
[00:22:37.592 --> 00:22:42.336]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[00:22:42.336 --> 00:22:48.720]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.

[00:23:25.076 --> 00:23:27.297]  There is only one silver solution.
[00:23:27.965 --> 00:23:32.866]  A revolution in body protection has arrived, only at FortressSurvivalLLC.com.
[00:23:32.866 --> 00:23:36.807]  Introducing the revolutionary, patented Level 3 Bulletproof Vest.

[00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:55.830]  Psalm 313.
[00:24:01.786 --> 00:24:06.988]  So, College Class Reading Constitution Undercover Video.
[00:24:27.248 --> 00:24:29.270]  Even World Net Daily's headline isn't strong enough.
[00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:29.990]  Neither was ours.
[00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:35.894]  It's actually two colleges shred Constitution.
[00:24:35.894 --> 00:24:43.179]  They only catch it on video on one, but the college admits they did shred the Constitution at the other.
[00:24:43.179 --> 00:24:47.823]  Meanwhile, we've got mixed news on the whole tranny mania.
[00:24:49.127 --> 00:24:51.148]  Houston bathroom bill.
[00:24:51.148 --> 00:24:58.012]  Voters reject LGBT ordinance that men can go into women's bathrooms and that men can go into theirs.
[00:24:58.012 --> 00:25:02.794]  You have to build special bathrooms and all the rest of this.
[00:25:02.794 --> 00:25:09.958]  And you'll walk into a place to get your hair cut now and they'll be like, sorry we don't have transgender bathrooms yet but we will.
[00:25:10.754 --> 00:25:15.716]  And it's just like, it's like, hey, you know, there's a lot of stuff going on in the galaxy.
[00:25:15.716 --> 00:25:20.357]  NASA just came out with top physicists and said they believe that there are other parallel universes.
[00:25:20.357 --> 00:25:28.500]  You know, there are some other, it's just there are other things other than trannies, other than men in dresses.
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:38.244]  But Illinois District violated transgender students' right, says boys who think they're girls can go in the girls' locker rooms when they're changing clothes and take their clothes off with them.
[00:25:39.773 --> 00:25:41.274]  That's the New York Times.
[00:25:41.274 --> 00:25:43.636]  See, because they can get away with that, they can get away with anything.
[00:25:43.636 --> 00:25:45.758]  It's the collapse of civilization.
[00:25:45.758 --> 00:25:47.520]  It's the destruction of the family.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.102]  It has nothing to do with somebody's sexual preference.
[00:25:50.102 --> 00:25:58.870]  It is about messing with everyone and making everyone adopt this particular lifestyle and prominent
[00:26:00.874 --> 00:26:14.317]  Feminist, lesbian, Camille Paglia, who's been writing for decades about the collapse of civilization and just the facts of life, that when you see massive attacks on men, massive attacks on family, it will be the collapse of civilization.
[00:26:14.317 --> 00:26:16.337]  But this is by design.
[00:26:16.337 --> 00:26:24.899]  Powerful article, CNS News reported on her article, Paglia, transgender mania is a symptom of the West's cultural collapse.
[00:26:24.899 --> 00:26:29.720]  Well, so is saying Germans can't drink beer at Oktoberfest because it offends the Muslims.
[00:26:31.531 --> 00:26:32.172]  I'm open.
[00:26:32.172 --> 00:26:33.515]  I'm not against Muslims.
[00:26:33.515 --> 00:26:38.324]  I want them to be able to have their life, as long as they don't infringe on mine.
[00:26:38.324 --> 00:26:43.172]  And a lot of Muslims don't want to infringe on our lifestyles, whatever they may be, conservative, liberal, libertarian.
[00:26:44.721 --> 00:26:49.464]  But they're being bullied and controlled by radical Islam that is becoming the dominant Islam.
[00:26:49.464 --> 00:26:53.926]  And there have been periods when Islam was totally about the sword, and periods when it wasn't.
[00:26:53.926 --> 00:26:56.107]  It's a very diverse history.
[00:26:56.107 --> 00:27:01.350]  But it was born out of the sword, and the Quran says it's about the sword.
[00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.852]  And the people try to deny this with political correctness.
[00:27:05.694 --> 00:27:06.495]  Paglia!
[00:27:06.495 --> 00:27:10.097]  Transgender mania is a symptom of the West's cultural collapse.
[00:27:10.097 --> 00:27:19.785]  Nothing better defines the decadence of the West to the jihadists than our toleration of open homosexuality and transgender mania now.
[00:27:20.657 --> 00:27:23.940]  Play that clip.
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:32.066]  Sex reassignment surgery, even today, with all of its advances, cannot, in fact, change anyone's sex.
[00:27:32.066 --> 00:27:38.491]  You can define yourself as a trans man or a trans woman as one of these new gradations along the scale.
[00:27:38.491 --> 00:27:45.136]  But ultimately, every single cell in the human body, the DNA in that cell remains coded for your biological birth.
[00:27:45.416 --> 00:27:51.960]  So there are a lot of lies being propagated at the present moment, which I think is not in anyone's best interest.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:28:00.585]  What I'm concerned about is the popularity and the availability of sex reassignment surgery.
[00:28:00.585 --> 00:28:08.850]  So it's someone who doesn't feel that he or she belongs to the biological birth in gender.
[00:28:09.711 --> 00:28:12.314]  People are being encouraged to intervene in the process.
[00:28:12.314 --> 00:28:18.681]  Parents are now encouraged to subject the child to procedures that I think are a form of child abuse.
[00:28:18.681 --> 00:28:20.723]  Either the hormones to slow puberty.
[00:28:24.808 --> 00:28:27.069]  ...surgical manipulations, etc.
[00:28:27.069 --> 00:28:34.555]  I think that this is wrong, that people should wait until they're of an informed age of consent.
[00:28:34.555 --> 00:28:37.357]  Parents should not be doing this to their children.
[00:28:37.357 --> 00:28:43.222]  And I think that even in the teenage years, it's too soon to be making this leap.
[00:28:43.222 --> 00:28:45.824]  People change, people grow, and people adapt.
[00:28:46.865 --> 00:29:00.314]  Now, I'm concerned that, again, about this, in fact, in my study of history in sexual personae, I'm always talking about the late phases of culture, and this is, I was always drawn to the late or decadent phase of culture.
[00:29:00.314 --> 00:29:00.695]  End of the cycle.
[00:29:00.695 --> 00:29:03.817]  Oscar Wilde is one of the great exponents of that in the late 19th century.
[00:29:03.817 --> 00:29:06.879]  He's one of my strongest influences from my earliest years.
[00:29:06.879 --> 00:29:10.262]  And I found, okay, in my study, that history is cyclic.
[00:29:11.202 --> 00:29:15.125]  And everywhere in the world you find this pattern, okay, in ancient times.
[00:29:15.125 --> 00:29:23.512]  That as a culture begins to decline, you have an efflorescence, okay, of transgender phenomena, okay?
[00:29:23.512 --> 00:29:26.955]  That is a symptom of cultural collapse, okay?
[00:29:26.955 --> 00:29:29.297]  So rather than people singing the praises
[00:29:29.697 --> 00:29:31.398]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:31.398 --> 00:29:32.599]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.957 --> 00:30:01.718]  Come and listen to a story about a man named Jeb.
[00:30:01.718 --> 00:30:03.998]  In Florida, they call me Jeb because I earned it.
[00:30:03.998 --> 00:30:05.018]  Poor Jeb.
[00:30:05.018 --> 00:30:09.239]  I got a lot of really cool things that I could do other than sit around being miserable.
[00:30:09.239 --> 00:30:10.980]  Jeb just got some more bad news.
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:18.341]  While both Trump and Carson would beat Hillary in Florida, former Florida Governor Jeb would lose to Hillary in the Republican-leaning state.
[00:30:18.341 --> 00:30:20.542]  And the Pope said, Jeb, move away from there!
[00:30:20.782 --> 00:30:25.266]  And with that news, Jeb's exclamation mark went completely flaccid.
[00:30:25.266 --> 00:30:27.187]  And his comments got even stranger.
[00:30:27.187 --> 00:30:28.308]  I love my dad.
[00:30:28.308 --> 00:30:29.149]  I'd kill for him.
[00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:31.351]  I'd go to prison for him because I love him so much.
[00:30:31.351 --> 00:30:34.613]  Well, I'm sure that comes up around the Bush dinner table, but come on.
[00:30:34.613 --> 00:30:37.416]  The Bushes, just like the Clintons, are too big to jail.
[00:30:37.416 --> 00:30:39.177]  They called me Vito Corleone.
[00:30:39.177 --> 00:30:40.418]  More like Fredo.
[00:30:40.418 --> 00:30:44.121]  Jeb's campaign finance woes highlight a problem with super PACs.
[00:30:44.121 --> 00:30:48.785]  Candidates can't pay their staff from super PACs because they presumably don't control them.
[00:30:49.205 --> 00:30:53.771]  An election is an advanced auction of stolen goods, and the Super PACs are where you place your bets.
[00:30:55.208 --> 00:30:57.569]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[00:30:57.569 --> 00:30:59.549]  Alex Jones here.
[00:30:59.549 --> 00:31:16.135]  InfoWarsStore.com is now partnering with the top-of-the-line storable food company, My Patriot Supply, to bring you the highest quality, freshest, longest-lasting, most affordable storable foods, private-labeled, from InfoWarsSelect.com, at the lowest price you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:31:16.135 --> 00:31:17.956]  The globalists want us dependent.
[00:31:17.956 --> 00:31:19.556]  We need to be self-sufficient.

[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.621]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:32:31.621 --> 00:32:36.603]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.

[00:32:43.386 --> 00:32:45.367]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:32:45.367 --> 00:32:47.468]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:32:47.468 --> 00:32:49.469]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:13.500]  People should not be afraid of their governments.
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:25.246]  Governments should be afraid of their people.
[00:33:25.246 --> 00:33:28.367]  Our government is responsible for the deaths of our people.
[00:33:43.629 --> 00:33:45.673]  Several party members have been murdered, Chief of Staff.
[00:33:53.241 --> 00:33:57.463]  We're interrupting your regularly scheduled program to bring you this terrifying report.
[00:33:57.463 --> 00:34:00.485]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:34:00.485 --> 00:34:02.486]  It just pancaked.
[00:34:02.486 --> 00:34:06.308]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[00:34:06.308 --> 00:34:09.310]  New York, very much a city still in chaos.
[00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:13.612]  The phones are not working properly, the subway lines are not working properly.
[00:34:13.612 --> 00:34:18.415]  The sky now black with smoke in front of us, just across the Tigris River here.
[00:34:18.955 --> 00:34:23.016]  This is shock and awe, Tom, for the population of Baghdad.
[00:34:23.016 --> 00:34:26.117]  Shock and awe, indeed.
[00:34:26.117 --> 00:34:32.098]  The people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent spirit of the American military.
[00:34:32.098 --> 00:34:35.399]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:34:35.399 --> 00:34:38.279]  Come on!
[00:34:38.279 --> 00:34:39.679]  It is a big idea.
[00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:41.540]  A new world order.
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:42.280]  I love my dad.
[00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:44.570]  I'd kill for him.
[00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:46.891]  I'd go to prison for him, because I love him so much.
[00:34:46.891 --> 00:34:47.971]  I love Bill Clinton.
[00:34:47.971 --> 00:34:51.112]  What does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family?
[00:34:51.112 --> 00:34:51.993]  My sister-in-law.
[00:34:51.993 --> 00:34:57.874]  When you are subverting the power of government, that's a fundamentally dangerous thing to democracy.
[00:34:57.874 --> 00:34:59.255]  What do you think of Edward Snowden?
[00:35:00.195 --> 00:35:01.236]  I think he's a traitor.
[00:35:01.236 --> 00:35:03.097]  Obama is the one that kills the U.S.
[00:35:03.097 --> 00:35:04.878]  troops if the Russians bomb any of them.
[00:35:04.878 --> 00:35:07.019]  Obama is the one that put them in harm's way.
[00:35:07.019 --> 00:35:09.340]  Obama is the one using them as human shields.
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:13.662]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history.
[00:35:13.662 --> 00:35:14.663]  I'm here to warn people!
[00:35:14.663 --> 00:35:16.223]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[00:35:16.223 --> 00:35:17.024]  This isn't a game!
[00:35:17.024 --> 00:35:22.126]  Get out!
[00:35:22.126 --> 00:35:22.507]  Get out!
[00:35:22.507 --> 00:35:22.807]  Get out!
[00:35:22.807 --> 00:35:23.927]  Welcome to America, ISIS!
[00:35:23.927 --> 00:35:24.648]  This is what we do!
[00:35:24.648 --> 00:35:24.708]  Woo!
[00:35:25.859 --> 00:35:28.900]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.621]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:35:30.621 --> 00:35:32.162]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:35:32.162 --> 00:35:41.526]  In 2012, your agency was saying, quote, the Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Al-Qaeda in Iraq are the major forces driving the insurgents in Syria.
[00:35:41.526 --> 00:35:42.846]  In 2012, the U.S.
[00:35:42.846 --> 00:35:46.108]  was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups.
[00:35:46.108 --> 00:35:47.148]  Why did you not stop that?
[00:35:47.148 --> 00:35:48.609]  Why didn't you come forward before?
[00:35:48.609 --> 00:35:49.949]  What were you waiting for?
[00:35:49.949 --> 00:35:53.031]  Well, for you, Inspector, I needed you.
[00:35:59.757 --> 00:36:02.518]  I suddenly had this feeling that everything was connected.
[00:36:02.518 --> 00:36:09.779]  We're all part of it.
[00:36:09.779 --> 00:36:12.780]  Are we ready for it?
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:18.861]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:36:18.861 --> 00:36:22.241]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is Alex Jones and I am your host.
[00:36:22.241 --> 00:36:24.742]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:36:26.325 --> 00:36:29.927]  We are now well into this worldwide transmission.
[00:36:29.927 --> 00:36:32.988]  Let me tell you about some of the guests that are coming up today.
[00:36:32.988 --> 00:36:47.155]  We have Stephen Mosier, the head of the major global organization that tracks true population trends, pop.org.
[00:36:47.155 --> 00:36:54.679]  And he, of course, has talked to the Chinese government and many others and helped actually get them to reverse their one-child policy
[00:36:55.703 --> 00:37:01.228]  Which is now causing their economy to basically collapse in the midterm.
[00:37:01.228 --> 00:37:10.436]  If you don't have 2.1 to 2.2 children to replace those that die, then the society starts to unravel and collapse.
[00:37:10.436 --> 00:37:15.360]  We need stable population, not reduced population.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:21.566]  There's also been a state ruling here in Central Texas, we have a constitutional lawyer coming in,
[00:37:24.108 --> 00:37:47.607]  To talk about it for 30 minutes at the end of the show, or the end of the three hours I host, where the Austin Police Department, an officer shot a black man that was running from what he believed to be a scene of a bank robbery, he was not the bank robber, and the police officer shot him in the back, and basically the state court threw it out, citing federal supremacy.
[00:37:48.931 --> 00:37:53.996]  And said that we can't try someone that kills someone, the feds have to.
[00:37:53.996 --> 00:37:57.079]  Now let's get past whether this was right or wrong.
[00:37:57.079 --> 00:38:01.484]  And it looks like a really bad thing to me.
[00:38:01.484 --> 00:38:10.293]  Regardless of that, this is local government saying the feds are the ones that decide everything.
[00:38:10.293 --> 00:38:12.195]  So this is essentially federalization.
[00:38:15.083 --> 00:38:16.904]  And that's what this is all about.
[00:38:16.904 --> 00:38:23.169]  The feds, if you'll just let them decide everything, will let police shoot whoever they want and basically get away with it.
[00:38:23.169 --> 00:38:27.692]  But they've got to go along with all the other political agendas of the globalists.
[00:38:27.692 --> 00:38:36.138]  If they don't go along with it, they will then white glove inspect the police and arrest them for their speech.
[00:38:36.138 --> 00:38:36.579]  You name it.
[00:38:37.583 --> 00:38:40.144]  Or for even shooting somebody that pulls a gun on them.
[00:38:40.144 --> 00:38:43.145]  So this is how they're taking over local police departments.
[00:38:43.145 --> 00:38:46.526]  We're going to be talking about that coming up.
[00:38:46.526 --> 00:38:49.227]  I want to finish up with the Camille Paglia clip.
[00:38:49.227 --> 00:38:52.047]  We played the first half of it.
[00:38:52.047 --> 00:38:57.489]  And then there's several articles that are linked to in the story on Infowars.com where she elaborates on it.
[00:38:57.489 --> 00:39:06.992]  But whether it was ancient Greece or Rome or Babylon or China, in every culture,
[00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:19.680]  When men start to behave like women, and men start to dress like women, that is done in the final phase before a total collapse.
[00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:28.134]  And Paglia came out and said that transgender mania is a symptom of the West's culture collapse.
[00:39:28.134 --> 00:39:30.216]  Let's go back to the clip where we left it off.
[00:39:30.216 --> 00:39:31.257]  Here it is.
[00:39:31.257 --> 00:39:32.518]  ...self to the world.
[00:39:32.518 --> 00:39:44.167]  In fact, these phenomena are inflaming the irrational, indeed, borderline psychotic opponents of Western culture in the form of ISIS and other jihadists, etc.
[00:39:44.167 --> 00:39:48.090]  Nothing better defines the decadence of the West
[00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:57.100]  I mean, I think that any vision of the future, the futurists from the science fiction of the late 19th century into the 20th century
[00:40:04.808 --> 00:40:13.553]  Usually, they have projected that men and women in distant space will start to conform to each other in gender.
[00:40:13.553 --> 00:40:16.175]  You see that in Star Wars.
[00:40:16.175 --> 00:40:18.176]  Gender seems to start to be erased.
[00:40:18.176 --> 00:40:22.559]  Men and women are working side by side, almost as units in a machine.
[00:40:22.559 --> 00:40:26.701]  There's something mechanical about it, this shaving away of gender differences.
[00:40:26.701 --> 00:40:32.185]  Yes, more and more, the masculine is seen as somehow retrograde.
[00:40:33.971 --> 00:40:34.311]  That's right.
[00:40:34.311 --> 00:40:37.774]  She realizes there's a scientific attack on men and she knows a lot more than she's letting on.
[00:40:37.774 --> 00:40:39.755]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:40:39.755 --> 00:40:40.516]  She's a smart lady.
[00:40:40.516 --> 00:40:43.338]  She studied history.
[00:40:43.338 --> 00:40:46.781]  And she is for people to have equality and freedom and for people not to be abused.
[00:40:46.781 --> 00:40:56.829]  But you've got to defend masculinity because that is the bipolar heart of humanity.
[00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:59.711]  The feminine and the masculine together make humanity.
[00:40:59.711 --> 00:41:03.634]  That is our journey together over thousands of years, over the eons.
[00:41:04.838 --> 00:41:05.999]  Our struggles.
[00:41:05.999 --> 00:41:09.462]  And women have done things to men, men have done things to women.
[00:41:09.462 --> 00:41:15.388]  But to then have the species turn against itself is the end of the species as we know it.
[00:41:15.388 --> 00:41:26.238]  And the social engineers, the social Darwinists, the transhumanist eugenicists have written countless books that we've reviewed, we've covered, we've quoted, I've made films admitting this plan.
[00:41:27.574 --> 00:41:29.075]  And she's trying to get folks to think.
[00:41:29.075 --> 00:41:30.755]  She's a smart professor.
[00:41:30.755 --> 00:41:32.316]  So she's giving them little hints.
[00:41:32.316 --> 00:41:34.597]  It's almost like it's a machine.
[00:41:34.597 --> 00:41:37.498]  It's almost like they're stripping something away.
[00:41:37.498 --> 00:41:41.459]  It's almost like we're being dehumanized.
[00:41:41.459 --> 00:41:45.361]  We're side by side working like prisoners.
[00:41:45.361 --> 00:41:47.502]  That's right.
[00:41:47.502 --> 00:41:51.223]  The globalists are jealous of that connection between men and women.
[00:41:51.223 --> 00:41:53.244]  They don't like the love humans have for each other.
[00:41:53.244 --> 00:41:56.025]  Brotherhood, kinship, fatherhood, motherhood.
[00:41:57.403 --> 00:41:58.423]  Male bonding.
[00:41:58.423 --> 00:42:01.044]  They're going after rituals of men bonding.
[00:42:01.044 --> 00:42:03.425]  They're going after rituals of women bonding.
[00:42:03.425 --> 00:42:12.909]  The globalists admit in their own plans in Brave New World Revisited, non-fiction, that Brave New World written in 1932.
[00:42:12.909 --> 00:42:16.251]  Go read that book 90 years later.
[00:42:16.251 --> 00:42:19.712]  90 years later.
[00:42:19.712 --> 00:42:21.173]  Brave New World.
[00:42:21.173 --> 00:42:21.973]  Almost 90 years later.
[00:42:23.737 --> 00:42:27.481]  And you go read that, and it's almost all come true in ways.
[00:42:27.481 --> 00:42:46.500]  And Huxley explained in 62 before he died, as I've said many times, I've played the interview here, an hour-long speech at Princeton, hour-long speech at Berkeley, excuse me, the one at Princeton as well, and he said, no, my brother runs the UN, this is the eugenics plan, we call it transhumanism, and once we mix up the sexes and put chemicals in the food and water,
[00:42:47.574 --> 00:42:56.298]  Then we're going to feminize men, make women masculine, but then we're going to mix the two, and then we're going to have a planned species, and you're going to be asexual.
[00:42:56.298 --> 00:42:59.159]  You're all going to have shaved heads, you're going to wear gray uniforms.
[00:42:59.159 --> 00:43:07.163]  You're like, you know, I've heard of that, I saw that in a movie, THX113A, which George Lucas admits is his version of Brave New World.
[00:43:11.417 --> 00:43:16.802]  So, we're getting messed with here, because the only way to conquer humanity, humanity will always resist you.
[00:43:16.802 --> 00:43:22.648]  The only way to conquer humanity, once and for all, is to end humanity as we are known.
[00:43:22.648 --> 00:43:25.490]  As we have been.
[00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:29.094]  And that's why the major textbooks that we've covered here, across the United States,
[00:43:33.763 --> 00:43:42.906]  Admit and say the family belongs to the bygone archaic era and is barbarous and must be phased out and finally eradicated.
[00:43:42.906 --> 00:44:00.812]  Yes, we can have a centralized computer run system with robot police dominating and controlling what's left of a suboid human population that only exists for the technocratic elite to play with like a cat plays with a wounded mouse with a broken back.
[00:44:02.745 --> 00:44:09.872]  The ritualized domination of humanity, the trampling of humanity, and the being trampled.
[00:44:09.872 --> 00:44:21.705]  To quote George Orwell, you think once in his progress towards a better engine, or a faster rocket, or better food production, or cleaner water, better health, more clothing, more shelter.
[00:44:22.796 --> 00:44:24.237]  More culture, beauty.
[00:44:24.237 --> 00:44:26.860]  No, Winston, we're an ugly culture.
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:29.883]  We're a culture that's gonna run you over and we're gonna be run over.
[00:44:29.883 --> 00:44:47.419]  You look at me, Winston, with black circles around my eyes and my wrinkles and how unhealthy I look, but the fact that I'm unhealthy and dominated shows the vigor of the parasite spirit we have created, the demonic force we feed, our god of death and humiliation and suffering.
[00:44:47.839 --> 00:44:50.001]  You want an image of the future, Winston?
[00:44:50.001 --> 00:44:57.648]  It's a big, black, bloody boot stomping on the human face forever, conquering humanity for Satan!
[00:44:57.648 --> 00:45:04.453]  I add a little bit to what, uh, O'Brien says to Winston.
[00:45:04.453 --> 00:45:06.975]  But I think you get the mode.
[00:45:06.975 --> 00:45:08.497]  I think you might be in the mood now.
[00:45:14.477 --> 00:45:35.946]  Imagine the social turmoil it's meant in elementary schools and intermediate and middle schools and high schools to have confused boys whose parents give them all these Prozac drugs and high fructose corn syrup and video games all day to decide that they want to get attention dressing up like a girl and go in the bathroom.
[00:45:37.864 --> 00:45:43.669]  Truth is, you can just put dark eye makeup on and act upset and alluring and you'll have all the women chasing you around.
[00:45:43.669 --> 00:45:45.330]  It's been like that for 30 years.
[00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:48.272]  I didn't have to do that, but the point was with guys that did that, it was all a big joke.
[00:45:48.272 --> 00:45:50.314]  I'd sit around laughing with them in college, too.
[00:45:51.732 --> 00:45:59.840]  So if you want to do that, don't dress in a dress and go in there, you know, wearing a dress with a little cherry pattern on it or a cupcake pattern on it with, you know, curlers in your hair.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.703]  Just, just, just, you know, dressing black and act all alluring like you're a vampire.
[00:46:03.703 --> 00:46:08.868]  Uh, you know, that'll get the, uh, get the 14 year old girls all day long, 15 year old girls if you want.
[00:46:08.868 --> 00:46:10.550]  But no, imagine 14 year old girls.
[00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:13.493]  They're in the, not the restroom, but in the gym.
[00:46:14.761 --> 00:46:21.065]  And there's a guy in there with long hair and he's got the same hormones, he's attracted to women.
[00:46:21.065 --> 00:46:26.908]  Let me tell you, half these so-called gay guys, you look at the anthropology, they're getting more girls, more dates than the straight guys.
[00:46:26.908 --> 00:46:29.790]  It's all bull in most of these cases.
[00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:35.934]  And it's a way to then get in the middle of the school, make a huge scene out of everything,
[00:46:37.134 --> 00:46:47.346]  People complain and now it makes the whole talk of the school how three or four guys are in the girl's locker room now and you're going to make the school and make the parents submit to it.
[00:46:47.346 --> 00:46:56.276]  And then it becomes the big issue in the school and now it's not reading, writing, arithmetic, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, science, exploration.
[00:46:57.597 --> 00:47:01.360]  No, it's all, I'm transgender.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.162]  And of course, you don't see girls doing aggressive stuff like this.
[00:47:04.162 --> 00:47:10.206]  There's almost no cases of women claiming they're boys and they want to be in with the boys.
[00:47:10.206 --> 00:47:14.910]  No, the women that think they're boys, they want to be in with the girls too.
[00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:16.591]  I mean, let's get real.
[00:47:16.591 --> 00:47:18.673]  Everybody wants to be in with the girls, don't they?
[00:47:19.738 --> 00:47:22.280]  Because they are the progenitor of life.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.701]  They are the magic creatures.
[00:47:23.701 --> 00:47:25.462]  They are the heart of the civilization.
[00:47:25.462 --> 00:47:28.604]  They have twice the DNA a man has.
[00:47:28.604 --> 00:47:33.707]  So a guy saying he's a girl, sorry, you don't have mitochondrial DNA.
[00:47:33.707 --> 00:47:34.948]  Don't have it.
[00:47:34.948 --> 00:47:36.729]  You're not even the full species.
[00:47:36.729 --> 00:47:37.629]  Women are.
[00:47:37.629 --> 00:47:47.576]  But you won't hear one word from the fake feminist about this because they tell women they love them because they want to control them and keep them on that reservation real close to them so they can destroy you.
[00:47:49.031 --> 00:48:07.968]  The truth is women, out of their mitochondrial DNA, they now have proven this, will release new genetics, which are actually old genetics, for key times and will decide the sex at the embryonic level and what to activate in the male that's going to be created that comes out of the woman, out of the earth, out of God's creation.
[00:48:07.968 --> 00:48:10.130]  How magic is that to defend women?
[00:48:11.036 --> 00:48:13.619]  Men are a weapon of women.
[00:48:13.619 --> 00:48:15.802]  Men are here to serve women.
[00:48:15.802 --> 00:48:18.505]  Men are here to die and build for women.
[00:48:18.505 --> 00:48:26.816]  Men are nothing but the entire defense mechanism of, not just in mammals, but in all major species.
[00:48:28.473 --> 00:48:32.295]  And there are some roles and subspecies where the women act as defenders as well.
[00:48:32.295 --> 00:48:36.237]  The point is, the idea that men and women are in competition is a sick joke.
[00:48:36.237 --> 00:48:47.623]  And the fact that men treat women bad and don't know how to get women's affection shows how stunted and destroyed they are because there weren't men in the house to show them how a man acts and to show them what women want.
[00:48:47.623 --> 00:48:50.365]  It's pathetic!
[00:48:50.365 --> 00:48:51.686]  I'm done ranting on that subject.
[00:48:51.686 --> 00:48:53.507]  When we come back, and I'll get more into that later,
[00:48:54.508 --> 00:48:55.869]  Big brother news.
[00:48:55.869 --> 00:48:59.230]  Fight over confederate flag decal could be investigated as hate crime.
[00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:02.371]  We'll show you the footage if you're a TV viewer, or a crowd of your radio listener.
[00:49:02.371 --> 00:49:03.552]  Ghost war in Syria.
[00:49:03.552 --> 00:49:05.412]  Russian spitsnats facing U.S.
[00:49:05.412 --> 00:49:06.553]  Army Special Forces.
[00:49:06.553 --> 00:49:08.573]  There's bound to be shooting, is the headline.
[00:49:08.573 --> 00:49:13.835]  A lot of good news as socialists, gun grabbers, and others lose election around the country.
[00:49:13.835 --> 00:49:17.377]  San Francisco sheriff known for sanctuary city defense loses reelection bid.
[00:49:17.377 --> 00:49:20.138]  Gun grabbers pushing with Bloomberg money are failing everywhere.
[00:49:22.079 --> 00:49:23.539]  I don't think we're winning the whole war.
[00:49:23.539 --> 00:49:27.620]  We're winning some battles, but they're going to probably blow up some buildings and blame it on us, so get ready for that.
[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:30.060]  Enemy fighters coming in, Watcher 6.
[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:32.581]  All right, continuing briefly.
[00:49:32.581 --> 00:49:39.862]  A bunch of really big specials in today, and that is the Oxy Powder and Liver Shield Cleanse Pack, 25% off.
[00:49:39.862 --> 00:49:41.362]  It ends today, 2 o'clock.
[00:49:41.362 --> 00:49:43.183]  You have 2 hours and 10 minutes.
[00:49:43.183 --> 00:49:45.263]  At 2 o'clock, it will be taken down.
[00:49:45.263 --> 00:49:48.544]  I should take it down earlier, because it's probably going to sell out, like, by next week.
[00:49:48.544 --> 00:49:49.484]  We've already sold most of it.
[00:49:51.323 --> 00:49:53.305]  But that's all available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:50:12.623 --> 00:50:18.669]  New special, ladies and gentlemen, that we're launching today, because the old specials are ending.

[00:51:28.570 --> 00:51:37.457]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.

[00:52:00.663 --> 00:52:05.304]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[00:52:05.304 --> 00:52:09.585]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[00:52:09.585 --> 00:52:10.965]  We typically do the same thing.
[00:52:10.965 --> 00:52:14.005]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[00:52:14.005 --> 00:52:16.206]  But have you considered heat storage?
[00:52:16.206 --> 00:52:18.426]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[00:52:18.426 --> 00:52:20.706]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[00:52:20.706 --> 00:52:22.347]  How will I keep my family warm?
[00:52:22.347 --> 00:52:24.827]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[00:52:24.827 --> 00:52:28.888]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[00:52:29.728 --> 00:52:30.829]  Another concern?
[00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:34.812]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[00:52:34.812 --> 00:52:37.394]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[00:52:37.394 --> 00:52:41.377]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[00:52:41.377 --> 00:52:44.179]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[00:52:44.179 --> 00:52:48.843]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.

[00:54:21.841 --> 00:54:23.083]  What do you mean?
[00:54:23.083 --> 00:54:25.465]  Why do you think I'm broke?
[00:54:25.465 --> 00:54:26.947]  If there's a new way...
[00:54:51.338 --> 00:54:55.381]  The new way is going back to the Republic, which is forward.
[00:54:55.381 --> 00:54:57.422]  Which is the latest, best system.
[00:54:57.422 --> 00:55:01.524]  Proven to work the best.
[00:55:01.524 --> 00:55:06.567]  But instead, we live in a scientific dictatorship.
[00:55:06.567 --> 00:55:11.790]  We actually live in the latter third, the beginning of the third act.
[00:55:14.002 --> 00:55:30.937]  And now things will move a lot faster and those that have been in denial about the type of tyranny we are facing will be brought face to face with what their denial has helped give birth to.
[00:55:30.937 --> 00:55:33.759]  You know, I want to get into all the big police state news.
[00:55:34.935 --> 00:55:37.277]  Britain wants every website people visited recorded.
[00:55:37.277 --> 00:55:37.978]  That's already done.
[00:55:37.978 --> 00:55:40.260]  It's worldwide standardization.
[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:43.482]  Verizon begins scanning and censoring customer emails.
[00:55:43.482 --> 00:55:47.386]  Telecom giant known for trying to block news on the internet.
[00:55:47.386 --> 00:55:48.607]  Just incredible.
[00:55:48.607 --> 00:55:50.728]  Incredible.
[00:55:50.728 --> 00:55:53.791]  Microsoft admits Windows 10 automatic spying cannot be stopped.
[00:55:53.791 --> 00:55:55.753]  Forbes.
[00:55:55.753 --> 00:55:56.153]  But you know what?
[00:55:56.153 --> 00:56:02.698]  I want to finish up with the transgender stuff because if you want to kill fire ants or you want to get rid of some other quote invasive
[00:56:03.678 --> 00:56:04.779]  Insect.
[00:56:04.779 --> 00:56:05.940]  You don't spray them with poison.
[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:11.965]  Now the University of A&M has developed a lot of these systems.
[00:56:11.965 --> 00:56:17.949]  You create stuff that confuses the sexual activities of the mosquito, the fire ant, whatever you're targeting.
[00:56:17.949 --> 00:56:19.951]  The hookworm.
[00:56:19.951 --> 00:56:23.574]  And that's how you basically can exterminate a species.
[00:56:23.574 --> 00:56:24.775]  And that's what they've done.
[00:56:24.775 --> 00:56:27.217]  This has all been tested incrementally.
[00:56:30.009 --> 00:56:36.336]  We've got jets spraying barium salts on people, and radioactive isotopes, and the soil's getting radioactive.
[00:56:36.336 --> 00:56:40.921]  I mean, we're in a very advanced system.
[00:56:40.921 --> 00:56:47.047]  And I just think folks should become aware of the fact you are being targeted, whether you deny it or not, it's still going on.
[00:56:48.032 --> 00:56:52.677]  But we've got Houston voters rejecting non-discrimination measure.
[00:56:52.677 --> 00:56:55.941]  These are conflicting votes and also rulings.
[00:56:55.941 --> 00:56:56.582]  And then U.S.
[00:56:56.582 --> 00:56:59.024]  school violated transgender student rights.
[00:56:59.024 --> 00:57:00.666]  Let's play the Houston News first.
[00:57:00.666 --> 00:57:01.066]  Here it is.
[00:57:02.274 --> 00:57:14.560]  One of the biggest objections we had was the fact that this ordinance allowed biological males, even registered sex offenders, who on any given day identified as a female, to go into a female restroom, shower, or locker room.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:18.422]  If that business owner said no, that business owner could be prosecuted.
[00:57:18.422 --> 00:57:20.323]  We thought that was just plain wrong.
[00:57:20.323 --> 00:57:22.824]  And Houstonians, I believe, felt that was just plain wrong.
[00:57:23.024 --> 00:57:27.525]  I'm going to come back and play the other clip to show you where Illinois is at, but think about it.
[00:57:47.022 --> 00:57:49.745]  They have signs up saying no men in women's bathrooms.
[00:57:49.745 --> 00:57:57.772]  One of the most famous so-called trannies in national history lived here in Austin and died a few years ago.
[00:57:57.772 --> 00:58:00.855]  And I was on AXS TV 18 years ago and he had a show.
[00:58:00.855 --> 00:58:05.260]  And they would go in the men's bathroom, the women's bathroom, they were obsessed with bathrooms.
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:06.281]  He and his girlfriends.
[00:58:08.308 --> 00:58:18.999]  And, I mean, they would take drugs in there, vomit all over the place, do other stuff in there, and they got kicked out, and they said, you're against this because we're transgender, and they said, no, you're vomiting everywhere.
[00:58:18.999 --> 00:58:22.422]  They would vomit in there almost every week, and the liberals all celebrated the vomit.
[00:58:23.413 --> 00:58:25.433]  Everything else, I'm not kidding.
[00:58:25.433 --> 00:58:33.155]  He had a big beard, he had a slobber coming out of his mouth, and they all would just bow to him because they want to make humanity hideous.
[00:58:33.155 --> 00:58:36.656]  Their God is hideous ugliness.
[00:58:36.656 --> 00:58:38.596]  And that's why they worshipped him.
[00:58:38.596 --> 00:58:40.277]  But hey, don't think we wanted Houston.
[00:58:40.277 --> 00:58:41.617]  They've got our kids.
[00:58:41.617 --> 00:58:42.877]  They've got our kids.
[00:58:42.877 --> 00:58:46.398]  They're teaching five-year-olds right now to bow down to Leslie Cochran here in Austin.
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:58.885]  Most of the InfoWars radio listening audience is aware of the high-quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at HDFirearms.com.

[00:59:42.012 --> 00:59:44.194]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:04.895 --> 01:00:06.216]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.216 --> 01:00:07.977]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.977 --> 01:00:09.739]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:11.320]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.701]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.701 --> 01:00:17.065]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.065 --> 01:00:22.088]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.088 --> 01:00:27.933]  Now, we've got huge economic news, huge military news, huge police state news, a bunch of guests coming up.
[01:00:27.933 --> 01:00:33.617]  But the reason I'm focusing so much on the whole transgender situation is what Camille Paglia, professor
[01:00:34.833 --> 01:00:50.502]  is talking about, she's a liberal, in the classical sense, that every time a society is about to collapse, there's this obsession with men becoming women and vice versa.
[01:00:50.502 --> 01:00:58.186]  And if they can force you to let men come in women's bathrooms, because there's not going to be women doing the other thing,
[01:00:59.795 --> 01:01:00.976]  Statistically.
[01:01:00.976 --> 01:01:04.180]  And then force that also on public schools and other facilities.
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:06.523]  They can do anything they want.
[01:01:06.523 --> 01:01:08.966]  They can set and control the definitions.
[01:01:08.966 --> 01:01:14.272]  And this is an attack, a scientific attack on civilization, on the family unit.
[01:01:14.272 --> 01:01:15.354]  It's not about diversity.
[01:01:15.354 --> 01:01:16.535]  It's not about tolerance.
[01:01:16.535 --> 01:01:17.917]  It's about an overwrite.
[01:01:19.053 --> 01:01:28.498]  So if you just join us, I'm going to play part of this piece from the AP analyzing it about Houston rejects non-discrimination measure.
[01:01:28.498 --> 01:01:30.939]  Notice how they call it a non-discrimination measure.
[01:01:30.939 --> 01:01:38.743]  You can't discriminate, see any discrimination, that you're a certain religion, you're a certain culture, you're a certain sex, isn't allowed.
[01:01:38.743 --> 01:01:42.685]  Mother and father, he or she, boy or girl, is hurtful.
[01:01:42.685 --> 01:01:44.546]  You must give up your identity.
[01:01:44.546 --> 01:01:45.847]  Your identity is hurtful.
[01:01:45.847 --> 01:01:46.207]  Here it is.
[01:01:47.632 --> 01:01:59.900]  One of the biggest objections we had was the fact that this ordinance allowed biological males, even registered sex offenders, who on any given day identified as a female, to go into a female restroom, shower, or locker room.
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:03.782]  If that business owner said no, that business owner could be prosecuted.
[01:02:03.782 --> 01:02:05.323]  We thought that was just plain wrong.
[01:02:05.323 --> 01:02:08.185]  The Houstonians, I believe, felt that was just plain wrong.
[01:02:08.285 --> 01:02:15.587]  This shows that the liberal leftist ideas of the Democrats, led by this mayor and led by Hillary Clinton, are going to be rejected.
[01:02:15.587 --> 01:02:20.349]  Not just by Republicans, but by Democrats who came out against this.
[01:02:20.349 --> 01:02:22.610]  It's just common sense and common decency.
[01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:24.891]  We don't want men in women's ladies rooms.
[01:02:24.891 --> 01:02:27.011]  This had nothing to do with equal rights.
[01:02:27.011 --> 01:02:29.992]  We already have equal rights guaranteed under our Constitution.
[01:02:29.992 --> 01:02:34.594]  This was a campaign of fear-mongering and deliberate
[01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:35.778]  Lies.
[01:02:35.778 --> 01:02:37.198]  There's the fruit mayor.
[01:02:37.198 --> 01:02:37.999]  Deliberate lies.
[01:02:37.999 --> 01:02:39.599]  I don't mean fruit because she's a lesbian, I mean she's a fruitcake.
[01:02:39.599 --> 01:02:40.399]  This is a misinformation.
[01:02:40.399 --> 01:02:46.260]  This is a calculated campaign of lies designed to demonize.
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.620]  There's women crying.
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:49.121]  We need men in the bathroom.
[01:02:49.121 --> 01:02:52.001]  We need 50 year old boys in the girls room.
[01:02:52.001 --> 01:02:54.442]  This guy looks like a linebacker.
[01:02:54.442 --> 01:02:55.902]  He wants to be in the women's bathroom.
[01:03:00.563 --> 01:03:02.544]  You don't have mitochondrial DNA, bud.
[01:03:02.544 --> 01:03:05.024]  You don't have a uterus, sorry.
[01:03:05.024 --> 01:03:12.886]  You're obsessed with bathrooms!
[01:03:12.886 --> 01:03:14.227]  Get him off, get him off.
[01:03:14.227 --> 01:03:15.507]  You know what this is really gonna do?
[01:03:15.507 --> 01:03:18.708]  It's gonna turn everything into one-person bathrooms, which is fine with me.
[01:03:18.708 --> 01:03:22.689]  I don't like being around men either in the bathroom.
[01:03:22.689 --> 01:03:23.809]  You want to get right down to it.
[01:03:24.991 --> 01:03:27.292]  They're trying to make the military now where the men and women are together.
[01:03:27.292 --> 01:03:29.434]  I mean this is just totally jacking on people.
[01:03:29.434 --> 01:03:31.135]  Now let's go to the Illinois piece.
[01:03:31.135 --> 01:03:35.978]  This is where, oh no, they're not just going to the bathrooms, they're going to go in the showers.
[01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:47.625]  Men with genitals, testicles and penises, using scientific terms here, are going to go in to the bathroom with your daughter.
[01:03:47.625 --> 01:03:49.266]  And it's an act of domination.
[01:03:49.266 --> 01:03:49.746]  Here's the clip.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:51.081]  Oh my gosh.
[01:04:09.657 --> 01:04:15.340]  The superintendent of your school district suggests that you may not really be a girl.
[01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:17.782]  There's not 800,000 sex slaves in America.
[01:04:17.782 --> 01:04:19.002]  They don't need any help.
[01:04:19.002 --> 01:04:22.624]  And say that your rights have been trampled.
[01:04:22.624 --> 01:04:24.785]  There's not 100,000 people dead in Mexico from the drug war.
[01:04:24.785 --> 01:04:25.466]  That's not a problem.
[01:04:25.466 --> 01:04:30.629]  Incredibly validating and incredibly inspirational.
[01:04:30.629 --> 01:04:34.571]  Oh, so beautiful and courage filled.
[01:04:35.011 --> 01:04:37.052]  So there you go, they rule that girl's bathroom.
[01:04:37.052 --> 01:04:39.853]  Here comes the 18-year-old, 19-year-old that's flunked twice with his...
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:06.643]  You've heard of the US government wasting money on studies like mountain lions on treadmills, shrimp on treadmills, and even the effects of Swedish massage on rabbits.
[01:05:06.643 --> 01:05:09.884]  This latest example of waste comes out of the Illinois EPA.
[01:05:09.884 --> 01:05:15.165]  In fact, I tweeted, state government needs nine-step anal retentive plan to compost pumpkins?
[01:05:15.165 --> 01:05:16.506]  That's right, it's all in the article.
[01:05:16.506 --> 01:05:20.327]  Illinois EPA, pumpkins must be managed to protect human health by Kit Daniels.
[01:05:20.507 --> 01:05:26.732]  And in it, you can find a link to the actual nine-step process for local cities to collect pumpkins for composting.
[01:05:26.732 --> 01:05:27.713]  Here's step two.
[01:05:27.713 --> 01:05:34.638]  Pumpkins must not be accepted from other persons, including but not limited to owners and operators of rented or leased residences where pumpkins were used for decorative purposes.
[01:05:34.638 --> 01:05:38.421]  Commercial haulers and other commercial, industrial, agricultural, and government operations are entities.
[01:05:38.421 --> 01:05:39.562]  How are you going to figure that out?
[01:05:39.562 --> 01:05:40.223]  Step nine.
[01:05:40.223 --> 01:05:46.888]  The transfer and ultimate disposition of pumpkins received at the collection event must comply with the agency's approval, including all conditions contained in the approval.
[01:05:47.108 --> 01:05:49.168]  Do you have your TPS report cover sheet?
[01:05:49.168 --> 01:05:51.689]  Did you see the memo about this?
[01:05:51.689 --> 01:05:54.789]  If you don't, then you cannot compost pumpkins in Illinois!
[01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:55.369]  Okay.

[01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:04.073]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[01:07:04.073 --> 01:07:15.418]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and infuse it with the latest research and technological development on

[01:08:01.129 --> 01:08:03.891]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.891 --> 01:08:08.433]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:08.433 --> 01:08:09.794]  They just joined us.
[01:08:09.794 --> 01:08:15.217]  Leanne McAdoo just sent Nico a text saying, you need to correct Alex.
[01:08:15.217 --> 01:08:18.039]  Men have mitochondrial DNA as well.
[01:08:18.039 --> 01:08:22.862]  Let me be technical, and I'm not going back to the textbooks and the science and watching Discovery Channel.
[01:08:22.862 --> 01:08:26.884]  I don't claim to be a scientist, but I've talked to genetic engineers.
[01:08:26.884 --> 01:08:30.286]  I have vestigial breast.
[01:08:31.781 --> 01:08:35.643]  I have nipples, but I'm not a woman.
[01:08:35.643 --> 01:08:37.324]  I do not have a uterus.
[01:08:37.324 --> 01:08:39.766]  Men and women are two different species.
[01:08:39.766 --> 01:08:44.428]  And I'm glad she was technically correcting me because I can elaborate on it now.
[01:08:44.428 --> 01:08:54.134]  Going from memory, anybody can look this up for themselves, women from the first woman to the last woman pass the entire mitochondrial DNA line down.
[01:08:55.276 --> 01:09:06.264]  Men pass basically a shell and it doesn't pass on all the information and it only passes on to males.
[01:09:06.264 --> 01:09:15.771]  So that's the difference, is that the mitochondrial DNA of women is the difference between the photo of a Ferrari and a Ferrari.
[01:09:15.771 --> 01:09:19.314]  Women have the Ferrari, men have a photo of the Ferrari.
[01:09:19.314 --> 01:09:23.017]  Women have real breasts that make milk, men have vestigial breasts.
[01:09:26.181 --> 01:09:29.183]  Men do not have a uterus.
[01:09:29.183 --> 01:09:34.026]  Now I know that's probably a conspiracy theory, but that's what's going on here.
[01:09:34.026 --> 01:09:46.193]  And so I was saying these men that say they're women do not have uteruses and do not have the full mitochondrial DNA.
[01:09:46.193 --> 01:09:48.815]  Just like I don't have real mammary glands.
[01:09:50.666 --> 01:09:52.247]  That's what I'm getting at.
[01:09:52.247 --> 01:09:54.527]  In fact, let's just show people.
[01:09:54.527 --> 01:09:55.848]  We have my weight loss photos.
[01:09:55.848 --> 01:09:57.769]  We can actually put it up there.
[01:09:57.769 --> 01:09:59.589]  I will assure you those are not mammary glands.
[01:09:59.589 --> 01:10:02.190]  I do have a big chest, though.
[01:10:02.190 --> 01:10:06.612]  And it's actually one of the areas with very low fat, since I've been exercising so much.
[01:10:06.612 --> 01:10:12.634]  But I will assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that I can't feed babies with those.
[01:10:12.634 --> 01:10:15.295]  But a woman who is fertile can.
[01:10:16.522 --> 01:10:18.543]  So, that is what it is.
[01:10:18.543 --> 01:10:20.544]  By the way, that's not my super weight loss.
[01:10:20.544 --> 01:10:23.585]  That's from month to month, last few months losing weight.
[01:10:23.585 --> 01:10:31.449]  You can actually go back to my best ones when I was the fattest probably was Bilderberg four years ago in England when I weighed about 280 pounds.
[01:10:31.449 --> 01:10:32.590]  I weigh less than 240 now.
[01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:35.671]  And you can really see where I had this huge belly.
[01:10:35.671 --> 01:10:38.913]  And I'm not really trying to start a plug here out of the gate.
[01:10:38.913 --> 01:10:42.454]  A lot of stations just tuned in and just joined us.
[01:10:42.454 --> 01:10:43.515]  Yeah, that's me in England.
[01:10:43.515 --> 01:10:44.856]  That's my huge triple chin.
[01:10:44.856 --> 01:10:45.256]  But can we
[01:10:46.016 --> 01:10:49.719]  Just type in Alex Jones Speech at Bilderberg, England and get me up on the stage.
[01:10:49.719 --> 01:10:55.082]  That's when I was really starting to look like John Belushi or something before he died.
[01:10:55.082 --> 01:10:59.445]  I mean, I was really, really getting fat.
[01:10:59.445 --> 01:11:08.612]  Yeah, just type into Google Alex Jones Bilderberg, England or Alex Jones Speech and you can see me up on the stage and that is some of the really, really, really portly ones.
[01:11:08.612 --> 01:11:13.335]  Yeah, that's me 50-something pounds lighter now.
[01:11:15.905 --> 01:11:17.366]  I carried it pretty good, man.
[01:11:17.366 --> 01:11:18.286]  280 pounds, 5'11".
[01:11:18.286 --> 01:11:22.748]  I mean, look at the size of that head!
[01:11:22.748 --> 01:11:25.309]  It must have its own weather systems!
[01:11:25.309 --> 01:11:28.190]  But again, I'm not against a man who thinks he's a woman.
[01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:32.032]  I'm not against a guy that, you know, wants to go have a sex change.
[01:11:32.032 --> 01:11:32.752]  That's your issue.
[01:11:32.752 --> 01:11:33.453]  I'm a libertarian.
[01:11:33.453 --> 01:11:36.174]  But don't make me pay for it in taxpayer money.
[01:11:36.174 --> 01:11:38.975]  And don't try to teach my 7-year-old daughter about it.
[01:11:40.219 --> 01:11:46.485]  Because we're, quote, tolerant, and then now you want to put men and women in each other's bathrooms?
[01:11:46.485 --> 01:11:52.612]  But thank you for Leanne correcting me, because that made me actually elaborate, because I tend to oversimplify things.
[01:11:52.612 --> 01:11:53.673]  Just look into it for yourself.
[01:11:53.673 --> 01:11:56.796]  I assure you, women do have uteruses.
[01:11:56.796 --> 01:11:58.918]  Women do have a higher fat content.
[01:11:58.918 --> 01:12:03.403]  Their brain has three times the connections between left and right hemisphere, which makes them more
[01:12:06.511 --> 01:12:10.674]  Intuitive makes them more psychic, you could say.
[01:12:10.674 --> 01:12:12.456]  Intuition.
[01:12:12.456 --> 01:12:17.600]  But it also makes women get more emotional in a combat situation.
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:22.864]  And that's why every government that's tried to put women statistically in with men, big problems.
[01:12:22.864 --> 01:12:31.912]  Because when arms and legs and stuff are blown off and guts is everywhere, they found women in combat tend to commit even more atrocities than men, by the way, historically.
[01:12:32.771 --> 01:12:40.136]  Once you get women in an actual murdering position, once a woman goes into the mode of killing people, it's not a pretty picture as well.
[01:12:40.136 --> 01:12:42.917]  And they had trouble turning it off.
[01:12:42.917 --> 01:12:48.881]  And just the idea that men and women are different, they say is sexist.
[01:12:48.881 --> 01:12:50.502]  Or that men and women exist is sexist.
[01:12:50.502 --> 01:12:59.588]  And I kind of went off on this jag because we've got Camille Pagli in a big article up on Infowars.com saying this is basically preparation for the collapse of civilization.
[01:13:00.825 --> 01:13:02.327]  I don't normally play clips twice.
[01:13:02.327 --> 01:13:04.930]  I've got so many other clips I want to get to, but this one's so powerful.
[01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:07.894]  Can we cue up the Camille Paglia piece again?
[01:13:07.894 --> 01:13:11.077]  And then coming up, we do have Wayne Madsen's report.
[01:13:12.034 --> 01:13:20.656]  Integrated from the radio show and his trip out to the Evergreen Air Base, the CIA Air Base in Arizona, tying it into 9-11.
[01:13:20.656 --> 01:13:28.139]  That is coming up as well at 8 after, at 1-08 today, or 1-30.
[01:13:28.139 --> 01:13:30.559]  Actually, I have a guest at 1-08.
[01:13:30.559 --> 01:13:32.060]  That's what this says.
[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:34.220]  What time is the guest?
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:35.241]  I've moved it to 1-30.
[01:13:35.241 --> 01:13:35.741]  Okay, good.
[01:13:35.741 --> 01:13:36.841]  This is total transparency.
[01:13:36.841 --> 01:13:39.702]  Everything's out in the open here, so we're just wargaming the show here on the air.
[01:13:40.834 --> 01:13:43.015]  To the lawyer, I move to 1.30.
[01:13:43.015 --> 01:13:48.919]  We will air that at 1 o'clock today, the special report.
[01:13:48.919 --> 01:13:52.782]  And we have the population breakdown on why China is getting rid of its one-job policy.
[01:13:52.782 --> 01:13:54.963]  Big victory for humanity.
[01:13:54.963 --> 01:14:03.469]  That is coming up with Stephen Mosier of pop.org, the population organization that studies all of that.
[01:14:05.359 --> 01:14:08.160]  And wow, the Washington Post even having to tell the truth.
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:12.583]  Horrors of one-child policy leave deep scars in Chinese society.
[01:14:12.583 --> 01:14:18.466]  You got Bill Gates and Ted Turner and them pushing that here.
[01:14:18.466 --> 01:14:22.408]  So, wow, the Washington Post did some good?
[01:14:22.408 --> 01:14:27.530]  Wow, maybe the worm is starting to turn.
[01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:28.951]  So that's all coming up.
[01:14:28.951 --> 01:14:33.834]  Before I get into the police state news, some really positive news on elections around the country.
[01:14:34.773 --> 01:14:37.015]  The military news and more.
[01:14:37.015 --> 01:14:39.838]  I do want to just remind listeners we're listeners supported.
[01:14:39.838 --> 01:14:52.089]  We're not like NPR that gets $455 million or more a year from taxpayers and begs for money every week and does infomercials for their so-called non-commercial sponsors.
[01:14:52.089 --> 01:14:55.032]  We don't get billions of dollars like NBC and MSNBC.
[01:14:56.874 --> 01:14:58.235]  To push all the propaganda.
[01:14:58.235 --> 01:15:01.456]  We are only funded by our sponsors and you, the listeners.
[01:15:01.456 --> 01:15:03.757]  And I basically have bypassed sponsors.
[01:15:03.757 --> 01:15:05.038]  I mean, I can get sponsors.
[01:15:05.038 --> 01:15:09.080]  It's just, it's really hard to get the highest quality consistently and have them stay with you.
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:09.720]  We've done that.
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:14.662]  We're about 80% self-funded with PrisonPlanet.tv nightly news memberships.
[01:15:14.662 --> 01:15:15.963]  One membership, $5.95.
[01:15:15.963 --> 01:15:18.104]  20 people can use each month.
[01:15:18.104 --> 01:15:19.184]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:15:19.184 --> 01:15:20.365]  I want to thank all the subscribers.
[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:29.701]  We have the best water filtration systems, the best non-GMO, high quality heirloom seeds, full spectrum, one of the biggest selections online.
[01:15:30.919 --> 01:15:39.022]  We have some of the best Patriot, anti-tyranny, pro-gun, pro-liberty, anti-socialist, Hillary for prison shirts, you name it.
[01:15:39.022 --> 01:15:47.905]  A limited selection of limited edition, made in America, Molon Labé belt buckles and long sleeves.
[01:15:47.905 --> 01:15:50.966]  Those are back in the camos that are always selling out.
[01:15:50.966 --> 01:15:53.467]  The women's Molon Labé with the gold leaf.
[01:15:53.467 --> 01:15:55.788]  It's one of the best looking, sexiest shirts out there.
[01:15:56.308 --> 01:15:58.110]  I mean, wait until you see your wife or girlfriend in one of these.
[01:15:58.110 --> 01:16:01.134]  You can see photos of Leanne doing a great job modeling that.
[01:16:01.134 --> 01:16:02.355]  They're on the site.
[01:16:02.355 --> 01:16:08.782]  InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:16:08.782 --> 01:16:10.224]  Brain Force is the new special.

[01:16:33.179 --> 01:16:34.500]  And finally, 25% off.
[01:16:43.075 --> 01:16:46.936]  Liver Shield and Oxy Powder together to do the liver cleanse that you've heard so much about.
[01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:54.239]  See the informational videos and more at Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:16:54.239 --> 01:16:58.981]  But if you want to experience, to have a shot, because I mean, we really haven't found anybody.
[01:16:59.361 --> 01:17:01.463]  Except maybe a few calls, a few emails.
[01:17:01.463 --> 01:17:08.890]  We're talking 99% of people have had dramatic explosive results with the liver shield and the six-day cleanse with the Oxy-Powder.
[01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:16.057]  But I would still consult your physician and read the five-star reviews for yourself and it is just ridiculous what happens.
[01:17:16.738 --> 01:17:17.318]  Ridiculous.
[01:17:17.318 --> 01:17:21.961]  I mean, Rob Dew in one week lost 12 pounds of crud that was in his intestines.
[01:17:21.961 --> 01:17:22.902]  He was in really good shape.
[01:17:22.902 --> 01:17:25.083]  Plays basketball, coaches basketball.
[01:17:25.083 --> 01:17:27.104]  Had a basketball scholarship in college.
[01:17:27.104 --> 01:17:28.245]  He's like 6'4".
[01:17:28.245 --> 01:17:29.265]  Great shape.
[01:17:29.265 --> 01:17:33.107]  And it just, even his little belly though, all he had, voop, gone.
[01:17:33.107 --> 01:17:33.968]  Now that's what happened with him.
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:39.004]  See what happens for you, regardless of your support in the broadcast, and we salute you.
[01:17:39.004 --> 01:17:41.426]  Also, spread the word about our local affiliates.
[01:17:41.426 --> 01:17:42.387]  That's vital.
[01:17:42.387 --> 01:17:44.268]  The enemy does not want this info out.
[01:17:44.268 --> 01:17:47.791]  We're in a race against the globalists to defeat them before they shut us shut down.
[01:17:47.791 --> 01:17:48.852]  Free speech.
[01:17:48.852 --> 01:17:58.621]  Become local sponsors of local AM and FM, or bare minimum, call the sponsors and thank them for sponsoring, and go shop with those local sponsors, because they're sponsoring this show.
[01:17:58.621 --> 01:17:59.042]  It's not
[01:18:00.010 --> 01:18:00.891]  Please do it.
[01:18:00.891 --> 01:18:02.692]  This is for you, too.
[01:18:02.692 --> 01:18:10.436]  We gotta get aggressive and vote with our dollars.
[01:18:10.436 --> 01:18:20.121]  Now, let's go ahead and get into some of the positive news.
[01:18:20.121 --> 01:18:22.343]  In Virginia and several other states,
[01:18:23.166 --> 01:18:28.510]  We'll cover this when we come back, because I've mixed my stacks up here.
[01:18:28.510 --> 01:18:37.777]  Three states, Bloomberg, anti-gunners for governor, lieutenant governor, and other top positions have gone down big time.
[01:18:39.326 --> 01:18:45.490]  Also, San Francisco sheriff known for sanctuary city defense loses election bid.
[01:18:45.490 --> 01:18:58.739]  Sheriff subject of national criticism after Mexican illegal immigrant allegedly shot, well he admits he shot her, he said it was an accident, and killed 32 year old woman on the San Francisco waterfront.
[01:18:58.739 --> 01:19:04.663]  Meanwhile, waves of Cubans, because they get so many more benefits than others, are crossing U.S.
[01:19:04.663 --> 01:19:05.584]  border from Mexico.
[01:19:07.785 --> 01:19:11.927]  Obama administration still refusing to enforce immigration laws.
[01:19:11.927 --> 01:19:14.508]  National media ignores black-on-white hate crime assault.
[01:19:14.508 --> 01:19:15.648]  I want to cover this when we come back.
[01:19:15.648 --> 01:19:17.829]  That's actually important.
[01:19:17.829 --> 01:19:18.909]  Oh, here it is.
[01:19:18.909 --> 01:19:25.312]  Bloomberg and his Virginia Senate candidate failed with gun control pitch.
[01:19:25.312 --> 01:19:30.434]  Billionaire contributor hoped winning Virginia election fights was a promise of more gun control.
[01:19:30.434 --> 01:19:32.174]  That didn't work for him.
[01:19:32.174 --> 01:19:36.316]  Weapons cache of fully autos hidden in Swedish immigrant center.
[01:19:38.252 --> 01:19:40.854]  Rioting illegals demand entry into Britain.
[01:19:40.854 --> 01:19:43.896]  Trash taxpayer-funded living quarters.

[01:19:48.339 --> 01:19:49.940]  It's all coming up.
[01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:51.021]  There's tons of news.
[01:19:51.021 --> 01:19:53.162]  Ghost war in Syria.
[01:19:53.162 --> 01:19:55.003]  Russian spitsnats facing U.S.
[01:19:55.003 --> 01:19:56.324]  Army Special Forces.
[01:19:56.324 --> 01:19:57.545]  There's bound to be shootings.
[01:19:57.545 --> 01:19:58.026]  Stay with us.
[01:19:59.235 --> 01:20:10.127]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?

[01:20:41.937 --> 01:20:44.019]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[01:20:44.019 --> 01:20:47.122]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.

[01:21:57.907 --> 01:22:02.133]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:02.133 --> 01:22:02.754]  It's true.
[01:22:02.754 --> 01:22:06.901]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:06.901 --> 01:22:09.304]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.

[01:23:55.536 --> 01:23:56.357]  Come and take it.
[01:24:01.463 --> 01:24:02.984]  Love is a burning thing.
[01:24:02.984 --> 01:24:05.006]  This show is documented.
[01:24:05.006 --> 01:24:09.390]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:12.112]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:24:12.112 --> 01:24:13.994]  It went down, down, down.
[01:24:13.994 --> 01:24:16.696]  And the flames went higher.
[01:24:16.696 --> 01:24:18.437]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[01:24:18.437 --> 01:24:24.082]  You know what I'm going to do to make sure I get it all exactly right, and aren't just with a gestalt over some lotifying things?
[01:24:24.082 --> 01:24:27.325]  I think I'm going to do a video on the differences between men and women.
[01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:30.256]  To get it all exactly right.
[01:24:30.256 --> 01:24:32.097]  Because men don't have uteruses.
[01:24:32.097 --> 01:24:35.458]  Women, on average, have three times the brain connections between left and right hemisphere.
[01:24:35.458 --> 01:24:36.818]  These are the known things.
[01:24:36.818 --> 01:24:41.559]  And then I start making points about men don't have the mitochondrial DNA.
[01:24:41.559 --> 01:24:44.719]  And I meant the pure, continued mitochondrial DNA.
[01:24:44.719 --> 01:24:47.160]  They have basically a vestigial form.
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:47.880]  I'm no scientist.
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:50.001]  I'm going off what I've read, what I've seen.
[01:24:50.001 --> 01:24:52.021]  Then I pointed out men don't have uteruses.
[01:24:52.021 --> 01:24:54.182]  Men don't breastfeed babies.
[01:24:54.182 --> 01:24:56.082]  And I said men have vestigial breasts.
[01:24:57.267 --> 01:25:05.609]  And I guess for all intents and purposes, if men take the right hormones, do the right stuff, there is a tiny bit of breast tissue that will produce a little bit of milk with some men.
[01:25:05.609 --> 01:25:09.590]  And I guess there's African tribes that do it ritualistically or whatever.
[01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:14.611]  The point is, men and women are different, and we're being biologically manipulated.
[01:25:14.611 --> 01:25:20.392]  I mean, yeah, chickens, a male chicken, if there's no females, it's biological, can switch to female.
[01:25:21.789 --> 01:25:24.791]  I mean, so if you want to get into it, there's a lot of anomalies.
[01:25:24.791 --> 01:25:28.853]  There's natural cases where you can have three identical twins.
[01:25:28.853 --> 01:25:35.017]  You know, there are cases where you got men that have a male member and a female uterus.
[01:25:35.017 --> 01:25:35.998]  I mean, I know all that.
[01:25:35.998 --> 01:25:39.660]  The point is, I'm talking about when the species replicates the way it's supposed to.
[01:25:40.692 --> 01:25:52.585]  And we're being messed with, and the globalists write textbooks admitting that's going on, like Camille Paglia broke down, and we're ending the cycle now with the globalists trying to balkanize everybody and engage in divide and conquer.
[01:25:52.585 --> 01:25:54.207]  Look at this latest article, the London Guardian.
[01:25:55.413 --> 01:26:03.237]  Children's author sorry for racial insensitivity in Pitcher's book, Showing Smiling Slaves.
[01:26:03.237 --> 01:26:14.504]  Emily Jenkins, whose book, A Fine Dessert, has drawn criticism for misleading depiction of slavery, now plans to donate her fee to the university diversity campaign.
[01:26:14.504 --> 01:26:16.044]  So that's just intimidation.
[01:26:16.044 --> 01:26:21.127]  You know, I went to the Smithsonian several times when I was younger.
[01:26:21.127 --> 01:26:22.448]  It's so huge in D.C.
[01:26:22.448 --> 01:26:23.929]  I've only seen a fraction of it, but I saw
[01:26:26.099 --> 01:26:27.940]  a whole exhibit on slave art.
[01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:30.101]  It's pretty neat stuff.
[01:26:30.101 --> 01:26:34.303]  And a lot of the art was children's dolls, and they were smiling.
[01:26:34.303 --> 01:26:37.005]  And you know why the black slaves made smiling dolls?
[01:26:37.005 --> 01:26:39.046]  It was because they were racist.
[01:26:39.046 --> 01:26:45.549]  And they wanted to depict black people as happy in slavery to continue the practice of it.
[01:26:45.549 --> 01:26:46.630]  No, they didn't.
[01:26:46.630 --> 01:26:54.534]  It was marveled by foreign historians and by abolitionists that blacks could be so happy in deplorable conditions, but they were
[01:26:55.273 --> 01:27:10.863]  Christian, and they had a lot of great culture and music and folklore, and it was marveled at by many a historian that it seemed the black slaves were happier in their degradation than the corrupt white slave owners.
[01:27:10.863 --> 01:27:18.008]  Because the philosopher Victor Hugo said, adversity makes men, prosperity makes monsters.
[01:27:18.008 --> 01:27:20.030]  On average, we all know that.
[01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:22.311]  Rich people that make their own money tend to have spoiled kids.
[01:27:22.311 --> 01:27:23.392]  Their kids become demons.
[01:27:25.663 --> 01:27:27.945]  Now, does that endorse the practice of slavery?
[01:27:27.945 --> 01:27:30.606]  Of course it doesn't!
[01:27:30.606 --> 01:27:38.331]  But it was marveled at by historians and foreigners that came from countries where they didn't have slavery at how incredibly happy blacks were.
[01:27:38.331 --> 01:27:51.140]  Not in slavery, but in that they had nothing and so they had to be strong and actually surmount what they were under.
[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:54.102]  That's been proven in every culture and every time.
[01:27:56.471 --> 01:27:59.452]  I'm not speaking out against prosperity.
[01:27:59.452 --> 01:28:10.756]  I'm for prosperity, but we talk endlessly about the problem of the paradox that liberty creates prosperity and then within a few generations you get a bunch of spoiled rotten brats.
[01:28:10.756 --> 01:28:13.737]  I don't care if you're black, white, whatever color you are.
[01:28:13.737 --> 01:28:18.699]  Everybody knows that you stop appreciating things.
[01:28:20.011 --> 01:28:37.623]  You know, I'm not a wealthy person, but compared to, you know, 20 years ago when I barely had money to get groceries, so I didn't bum money off my parents when I was launching my media career, and sometimes I didn't have money for dinner and I ran out of food and I was getting paid the next day, I would go to my parents' house and get in their refrigerator.
[01:28:37.623 --> 01:28:41.345]  My mom would say, oh, come in and get something to eat.
[01:28:41.345 --> 01:28:41.926]  20 years ago,
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:52.326]  Twenty-one years ago, when I first started my media operation, I had so little money, and spending what I had on microphones, cameras, gas money, had two jobs.
[01:28:52.326 --> 01:28:58.850]  I would go to my parents, and a couple days a week when I ran out of food, and I would eat their food.
[01:28:58.850 --> 01:29:07.315]  But I was the most happy I ever was when I barely had money for gas, when I was working multiple jobs, when I was launching, I was so hungry, I was so alive.
[01:29:09.693 --> 01:29:21.284]  It's kind of sick I don't worry much about clothes I buy or things like that or I'll be checking into a nice hotel and I'll realize that 20 years ago I would have marveled to be in a hotel room like that.
[01:29:21.284 --> 01:29:24.347]  My parents, you know, don't stay in places that nice and these aren't even that fancy.
[01:29:25.495 --> 01:29:29.498]  It's just, to then be around people that are nouveau riche and unappreciated, it's weird.
[01:29:29.498 --> 01:29:32.100]  And I'm not lauding the virgins of the poor.
[01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:34.822]  The Pope was doing that to push people being poor.
[01:29:34.822 --> 01:29:39.726]  I was simply pointing out that adversity makes men, prosperity makes monsters.
[01:29:39.726 --> 01:29:40.246]  We'll be back.
[01:29:40.246 --> 01:29:41.967]  I'll get to the whole racial attack stuff.
[01:29:41.967 --> 01:29:47.271]  We got a guest joining us on the one-child policy supposedly being deactivated in China.
[01:29:47.271 --> 01:29:48.232]  This is really positive news.
[01:29:48.232 --> 01:29:49.433]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.433 --> 01:29:51.955]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.955 --> 01:29:54.637]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.361 --> 01:30:03.863]  Two more whistleblowers were arrested by the Vatican today as two books being released this week.
[01:30:03.863 --> 01:30:18.489]  Alleged the Vatican Bank is involved in money laundering, insider trading, market manipulation, offering sainthood for sale, and taking funds collected for a children's hospital and using them to remodel a mega penthouse.
[01:30:18.489 --> 01:30:23.832]  All this while Pope Francis lectures us on his vision of a quote, poor church, unquote.
[01:30:24.557 --> 01:30:32.218]  At best, the Vatican bank scandal is a tale of a Pope who pushes global governance while he can't even manage his own small government.
[01:30:32.218 --> 01:30:36.699]  But at worst, it's the tip of an iceberg of greed and corruption.
[01:30:36.699 --> 01:30:41.400]  The Pope tells us we need global governance and wealth distribution because of greed.
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:44.320]  But he doesn't tell us whose greed.
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:51.662]  Maybe we need to be concerned about his greed, and the greed of the multinational elite who are pushing the global agenda with him.
[01:30:51.662 --> 01:30:53.742]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[01:30:58.519 --> 01:31:02.022]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:02.022 --> 01:31:10.287]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:10.287 --> 01:31:15.711]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:31:29.553 --> 01:31:31.774]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:31:31.774 --> 01:31:36.755]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[01:31:36.755 --> 01:31:40.036]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:31:40.036 --> 01:31:43.537]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:31:43.537 --> 01:31:45.278]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:31:45.538 --> 01:31:46.439]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[01:31:46.439 --> 01:31:47.600]  It doesn't have garbage in it.

[01:32:53.834 --> 01:32:54.815]  Fortune favors the bold.
[01:33:10.603 --> 01:33:11.885]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:11.885 --> 01:33:15.951]  That's right, all these cynical people think...
[01:33:25.868 --> 01:33:34.735]  I think because they're smart, they're good looking, it's gonna go on forever.
[01:33:34.735 --> 01:33:38.057]  Their arrogance will wear off as time goes on.
[01:33:46.368 --> 01:33:56.215]  The truth is, the nice guys need to stand up to the oppressive.
[01:33:56.215 --> 01:33:59.277]  He's stopped bowing down and being wimps.
[01:33:59.277 --> 01:34:01.179]  We've had him on several times before.
[01:34:01.179 --> 01:34:03.140]  We probably got a time zone snafu or something.
[01:34:03.140 --> 01:34:05.362]  Nobody's fault.
[01:34:05.362 --> 01:34:06.082]  Steven Mosier.
[01:34:07.003 --> 01:34:12.110]  of the Population Research Group is not answering his phone.
[01:34:12.110 --> 01:34:13.773]  I'll get him back on soon.
[01:34:13.773 --> 01:34:19.641]  They've got a lot of great projects there showing the actual math.
[01:34:19.641 --> 01:34:20.782]  Cut and dry statistics.
[01:34:21.810 --> 01:34:22.210]  I don't think so.
[01:34:42.363 --> 01:34:45.185]  But there are a lot of amazing articles here.
[01:34:45.185 --> 01:34:49.768]  Horrors of one-child policy leave deep scars in Chinese society.
[01:34:49.768 --> 01:34:54.452]  So I will speak a little bit on this and then open the phones up and go to your calls.
[01:34:54.452 --> 01:34:55.052]  Beijing.
[01:34:55.052 --> 01:35:01.137]  His wife was seven months pregnant with their second child when the group of people barged into his home and took her away.
[01:35:01.137 --> 01:35:07.141]  He followed them to the local hospital where, against medical advice and despite his pleadings, they jammed a needle into her belly.
[01:35:09.676 --> 01:35:10.777]  Unbelievable.
[01:35:10.777 --> 01:35:13.378]  They grabbed my wife's body like they were grabbing a pig.
[01:35:13.378 --> 01:35:17.921]  Four or five people holding her hands and legs and head and injecting a shot into her belly.
[01:35:17.921 --> 01:35:20.282]  A man said, asking not to be named for fear of retribution.
[01:35:20.282 --> 01:35:22.644]  Neither my wife nor I signed any consent form.
[01:35:22.644 --> 01:35:26.025]  Ten hours later, she gave birth to a boy, wiggling and faintly crying.
[01:35:26.025 --> 01:35:31.289]  But the doctors in southern Hunan province were not even let her hold the dying infant, the husband said.
[01:35:31.289 --> 01:35:37.012]  They put the baby in a plastic bag and instructed him to pay a cleaner a small sum to bury it on a nearby hill.
[01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:55.198]  The incident happened not during the horrors of Mao Zedong, inspired many in the 1950s and 60s, but the 2011 in the internet age when China was walking proudly on the global stage as a major power.
[01:35:55.198 --> 01:35:58.300]  Unprecedented to have the Washington Post tell the truth.
[01:36:03.024 --> 01:36:07.865]  China has announced that they're going to basically ease off in the next few years in the one-child policy.
[01:36:07.865 --> 01:36:12.567]  That means they'll selectively still target people for political retribution and kill their kids.
[01:36:12.567 --> 01:36:19.649]  They actually grab six-month-old people, hide, and take them for organ harvesting.
[01:36:19.649 --> 01:36:24.030]  Communist Chinese is the model of the New World Order.
[01:36:24.030 --> 01:36:27.311]  The dehumanization is so off the chart, I don't even have ways to describe it.
[01:36:29.209 --> 01:36:38.514]  The CPS will take your child if they're 11 years old and you get home at 6 from work and they're seen for one hour in a fenced backyard playing basketball.
[01:36:38.514 --> 01:36:39.375]  They will be taken.
[01:36:39.375 --> 01:36:47.499]  I can pull up AP with a straight face where parents are indicted for 11-year-olds in the backyard.
[01:36:47.499 --> 01:36:48.640]  That's the nanny state.
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:56.224]  In China, 2-year-olds, 3-year-olds by the millions are chained every day to fences and power poles and light poles.
[01:36:58.137 --> 01:37:02.983]  To use the bathroom on the ground while their parents work in slave conditions.
[01:37:02.983 --> 01:37:06.907]  You will not hear a word out of Apple, who is the most egregious abuser.
[01:37:06.907 --> 01:37:08.850]  Okay?
[01:37:10.609 --> 01:37:19.871]  I mean, you just cannot describe how the liberal kingpins, almost every time I look into it, run the most horrible slave pits in the world.
[01:37:19.871 --> 01:37:21.372]  Because they hate humans.
[01:37:21.372 --> 01:37:28.894]  They pose, though, and wear little black t-shirts and little Levi's pants like Steve Jobs as their uniform to look non-threatening.
[01:37:28.894 --> 01:37:33.275]  They are the most vicious, evil people the earth has ever seen.
[01:37:34.676 --> 01:37:35.617]  And I'll prove that right now.
[01:37:35.617 --> 01:37:38.600]  You can pull up Bill Gates' statements about one-child policy.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:39.721]  He wants it here in America.
[01:37:39.721 --> 01:37:41.142]  He wants it in Europe.
[01:37:41.142 --> 01:37:42.763]  Endorsing China.
[01:37:42.763 --> 01:37:44.885]  Endorsing their activities.
[01:37:44.885 --> 01:37:45.826]  David Rockefeller.
[01:37:45.826 --> 01:37:48.789]  You can just type into Google, David Rockefeller, New York Times.
[01:37:48.789 --> 01:37:49.930]  Praising Mao Tse-Tung.
[01:37:49.930 --> 01:37:54.134]  You can read his 77 article, that Mao was the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[01:37:54.134 --> 01:37:55.015]  Mao Tse-Tung
[01:37:56.790 --> 01:38:00.832]  In 1949 was put in, basically by David Rockefeller and the Rockefellers.
[01:38:00.832 --> 01:38:03.493]  The CIA put him in, that's been declassified.
[01:38:03.493 --> 01:38:08.015]  John Birch Society said in the 60s, it was declassified in 2000.
[01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:10.136]  History Channel admits it.
[01:38:10.136 --> 01:38:13.598]  They did throw out Chiang Kai-shek.
[01:38:13.598 --> 01:38:15.459]  They did run him off to Taiwan.
[01:38:15.459 --> 01:38:19.241]  They had him then, Mao, they gave Mao all the coordinates.
[01:38:20.370 --> 01:38:39.779]  of Army and Naval officers, because the Army and Navy didn't know all this was happening, to be rolled up because Congress had other operations outside of certain groups, and it was a dual process of trying to stop the Communists, so they allowed the Communists to roll up anti-Communist networks set up by the previous administration.
[01:38:39.779 --> 01:38:44.262]  We're talking about Harry Truman right now.
[01:38:44.262 --> 01:38:44.942]  What a monster.
[01:38:48.663 --> 01:38:56.369]  That's who John Birch was, was a military officer they captured, they tortured, he wouldn't give up the codes, all the rest of it.
[01:38:56.369 --> 01:38:59.291]  But that's how this stuff operates, that's what goes on.
[01:39:05.714 --> 01:39:16.502]  We do have the Director of the Population Research Institute, Stephen Mosier, on with us, pop.org, to talk about what a big deal this is, that China is now reversing its one-child policy.
[01:39:16.502 --> 01:39:17.963]  The numbers vary.
[01:39:17.963 --> 01:39:21.145]  40, 50, 60 million more girls than boys.
[01:39:21.145 --> 01:39:23.327]  I just committed a thought crime saying boys and girls.
[01:39:23.327 --> 01:39:24.768]  We're not in a culture or anything in this country.
[01:39:24.768 --> 01:39:26.309]  Sorry, I'll upset the transgenders.
[01:39:27.466 --> 01:39:31.867]  But if you don't have 2.1 children, the society will start collapsing.
[01:39:31.867 --> 01:39:33.188]  There's no one there to take care of you.
[01:39:33.188 --> 01:39:36.069]  Don't worry, we have death panels, Bill Gates says.
[01:39:36.069 --> 01:39:46.292]  So everything you see in China was set up by the transhumanists and the eugenicists at the end of World War II, and China was the testbed and is the main testbed.
[01:39:47.012 --> 01:39:48.433]  Even more than the U.S.
[01:39:48.433 --> 01:39:54.195]  for internet censorship, social engineering, organ harvesting, cloning, GMO.
[01:39:54.195 --> 01:40:00.878]  I mean folks, they've got human milk grown in cow udders for sale in China.
[01:40:00.878 --> 01:40:05.920]  And those products make their way collagen from dead babies into cosmetics.
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:07.961]  I mean, it is insane.
[01:40:07.961 --> 01:40:12.863]  But this is a devastating victory against tyranny, against the anti-human folks.
[01:40:14.807 --> 01:40:17.368]  Who have this one-child policy in China.
[01:40:17.368 --> 01:40:25.652]  Now folks will say you're racist because I don't want to pay for 10,000 Chinese women a month, CNN reports, to come here and have their babies for free.
[01:40:25.652 --> 01:40:26.792]  I'm a real bleeding heart.
[01:40:26.792 --> 01:40:27.873]  I want them to have their kids.
[01:40:27.873 --> 01:40:29.233]  I want to industrialize them.
[01:40:29.233 --> 01:40:35.216]  They'll then bottom out at about maybe 1.7 billion and then their population will probably start declining.
[01:40:35.216 --> 01:40:37.137]  It's already starting to happen in many areas.
[01:40:37.137 --> 01:40:39.838]  It's happened in the West, from Japan to the US.
[01:40:39.838 --> 01:40:41.679]  I want Chinese to succeed.
[01:40:43.177 --> 01:40:54.062]  I don't want them to come here and everything paid for and be colonized by the globalists and socialism and then they bring all these communist programs and totalitarian ideas and the Chinese censor our internet.
[01:40:54.062 --> 01:40:56.563]  Stephen Mosier, thank you so much for joining us, sir.
[01:40:56.563 --> 01:40:59.124]  Let me go over your bio.
[01:40:59.124 --> 01:41:04.287]  He's a best-selling author, internationally recognized authority on China and population issues as well as an acclaimed speaker.
[01:41:05.629 --> 01:41:13.456]  He's worked tirelessly since 79 to fight coercive population control programs and has helped hundreds of thousands of women and families worldwide over the years.
[01:41:13.456 --> 01:41:18.061]  In 79, Stephen was the first American social scientist to visit mainland China.
[01:41:18.061 --> 01:41:26.148]  He was invited there by the Chinese government, where he has access to government documents and actually witnessed women being forced to have abortions under the new one-child policy.
[01:41:26.849 --> 01:41:36.537]  Mr. Moser was a pro-choice atheist at the time, but witnessing these traumatic abortions led him to reconsider his convictions and to eventually become a practicing pro-life Roman Catholic.
[01:41:36.537 --> 01:41:39.980]  Stephen Moser lives in Virginia with his wife, Vera, and their nine children.
[01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:41.180]  Pop.org.
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:43.302]  Thank you for coming on, sir.
[01:41:43.302 --> 01:41:45.424]  You've got the floor for the next 20 minutes.
[01:41:45.424 --> 01:41:51.509]  How big a deal is this to have China begin to reverse this beyond-Hitlerian policy?
[01:41:52.847 --> 01:41:54.368]  Well, the policy is horrible.
[01:41:54.368 --> 01:42:02.794]  I mean, the policy has resulted in 400 million unborn and newborn children being killed over the past 35 years.
[01:42:02.794 --> 01:42:11.140]  It's resulted in hundreds of millions of young mothers being forced to be deported and then sterilized over the same period, the last three and a half decades.
[01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:15.683]  It's also resulted in, you mentioned, tens of millions of missing baby girls.
[01:42:15.683 --> 01:42:18.365]  And tens of millions of young men who will not be able to find brothers.
[01:42:18.365 --> 01:42:20.066]  Yeah, I should have said more boys than girls.
[01:42:20.066 --> 01:42:21.247]  I think I got it backwards, sorry.
[01:42:22.182 --> 01:42:32.085]  Well, it's a lot more boys than girls, and 30 million, 35 million young men will not be able to get married because their brides have been killed.
[01:42:32.085 --> 01:42:41.728]  And there was recently a Chinese economist, probably a member of the Chinese Communist Party, who said, well, because of the shortage of women, we may have to institute polygyny.
[01:42:41.728 --> 01:42:44.148]  People may not know what polygyny is.
[01:42:44.148 --> 01:42:46.849]  It's the practice of one woman having three or four husbands.
[01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:51.221]  He said that would be a perfect solution to the bride shortage in China.
[01:42:51.221 --> 01:42:54.402]  We'd just force women to marry more than one man.
[01:42:54.402 --> 01:43:08.645]  Now, I think that's not a very good idea, but you could see how the one-party dictatorship that rules China might see that as the solution to the problem of all these bachelors running around.
[01:43:08.645 --> 01:43:11.366]  Your story is amazing if you speak to that in the numbers.
[01:43:13.077 --> 01:43:22.599]  An atheist, kind of an establishment guy, they let you in, and seeing the reality, I guess, activated your humanity at a deeper level, or put it in your own words?
[01:43:22.599 --> 01:43:26.160]  Well, I went into China as an atheist.
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:30.281]  I went into China as someone who believed that China was overpopulated.
[01:43:30.281 --> 01:43:33.041]  Its primary problem was too many people.
[01:43:33.041 --> 01:43:41.303]  I left China after having seen women, young women, 7, 8, 9 months pregnant, forcibly aborted by a cesarean section abortion.
[01:43:42.304 --> 01:43:43.145]  The horror of that.
[01:43:43.145 --> 01:43:50.549]  I was in the operating room when they were opening up these women like tin cans and removing their dead or dying babies.
[01:43:50.549 --> 01:44:04.477]  So I left China as a believer in God because I saw the pit of hell open up for me and I decided that God better exist otherwise the universe was mad if such evil could exist.
[01:44:04.477 --> 01:44:11.421]  And I also left China believing that China's primary problem was the 75 million members of the Chinese Communist Party.
[01:44:12.116 --> 01:44:22.462]  Who were absolutely ruling, misruling China and misguiding the economy and keeping the rest of the Chinese people in poverty.
[01:44:22.462 --> 01:44:24.083]  And my view of that hasn't changed.
[01:44:24.083 --> 01:44:34.348]  China is ruled by a tiny elite, which has a lock on all political, all economic power in the country.
[01:44:34.348 --> 01:44:37.670]  And the Chinese people are simply serfs.
[01:44:38.642 --> 01:44:45.009]  To this large and growing number of party members led by Xi Jinping and the senior leaders of the Chinese Communist Party.
[01:44:45.009 --> 01:44:53.738]  Now these guys, Alex, they don't lose any sleep over the fact that hundreds of millions of babies have been killed or women have been brutalized.
[01:44:53.738 --> 01:44:54.759]  They don't care about that.
[01:44:54.759 --> 01:45:01.746]  The reason they're relaxing a little bit the one-child policy and now saying to Chinese couples, you can have a second child,
[01:45:03.003 --> 01:45:10.027]  What keeps them up at night is the realization that their misguided policy is crippling future economic growth.
[01:45:10.027 --> 01:45:13.969]  For the last two years, China's workforce has been actually shrinking.
[01:45:13.969 --> 01:45:19.672]  Last year, the workforce in China fell by 4 million, which is a pretty big number even by China's standards.
[01:45:19.672 --> 01:45:23.674]  The over-60 population is exploding, the aging of the population, right?
[01:45:23.674 --> 01:45:25.315]  The average family now in China.
[01:45:25.851 --> 01:45:34.431]  So they're starting to listen to you and the math and understand they're going to collapse without having more kids.
[01:45:35.208 --> 01:45:39.350]  Oh, absolutely, and they're worried above all at continuing economic growth.
[01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.730]  Why?
[01:45:39.730 --> 01:45:46.114]  Because it makes the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party wealthy, because they all profit by this.
[01:45:46.114 --> 01:45:57.780]  I mean, the former president of China walked away with billions of dollars in assets that he'd accumulated over his ten years in office at an annual official salary of about $4,000 a month.
[01:45:57.780 --> 01:45:59.481]  Now, where did all that money come from?
[01:45:59.481 --> 01:46:02.242]  It didn't come from his savings.
[01:46:02.242 --> 01:46:03.523]  So they're growing rich.
[01:46:04.185 --> 01:46:07.667]  Uh, over the, the, uh, plundering of the Chinese economy.
[01:46:07.667 --> 01:46:10.488]  And they want that economy to continue to grow.
[01:46:10.488 --> 01:46:17.612]  They've now seen that their one-child policy is crippling their economic growth and aging their population.
[01:46:17.612 --> 01:46:20.173]  And, uh, the, the Jor ride may soon be over.
[01:46:20.173 --> 01:46:23.375]  And I also notice India, India is starting to grow faster than them.
[01:46:24.605 --> 01:46:28.388]  Well, India has a younger and more dynamic population.
[01:46:28.388 --> 01:46:38.197]  And as everybody knows, it's the younger people who invest, they start new businesses, they buy homes and cars, they produce more than they consume.
[01:46:38.197 --> 01:46:43.762]  And of course, as we get older, that equation flips over and you begin to consume more than you produce.
[01:46:43.762 --> 01:46:48.666]  So what happens as the entire world accelerates towards the demographic cliff?
[01:46:48.666 --> 01:46:49.527]  What do you see happening?
[01:46:50.782 --> 01:46:59.968]  Well, what I see happening is shrinking markets, falling stock markets, bond prices plummeting, real estate prices going into the toilet.
[01:46:59.968 --> 01:47:03.351]  If you want to see what the future looks like, look at Japan today.
[01:47:03.351 --> 01:47:12.357]  Japan's been in an economic recession, a demographic recession, I should say, for the last 30 years, and it's only going to get worse in the future.
[01:47:13.174 --> 01:47:14.114]  And the graph follows.
[01:47:14.114 --> 01:47:20.697]  As soon as they started having 1.5 kids in the early 90s, their profits went down and now they're collapsing.
[01:47:20.697 --> 01:47:22.458]  I mean, it's real simple.
[01:47:22.458 --> 01:47:24.339]  Yeah, it is very simple.
[01:47:24.339 --> 01:47:26.860]  The ultimate resource is human beings.
[01:47:26.860 --> 01:47:29.181]  The one resource you cannot do without.
[01:47:29.181 --> 01:47:38.845]  And our radical, you know, environmental zealots who want to drastically reduce the world's population don't tell people that if we do that, and we seem to be doing it quite well on our own,
[01:47:39.304 --> 01:47:42.985]  That we will see our standard of living go into the toilet.
[01:47:42.985 --> 01:47:43.525]  That's right.
[01:47:43.525 --> 01:47:59.870]  All these liberal anti-human yuppies that think if there's less people they're going to get more, that's what they're taught with population control, don't understand they are slitting their own financial throats by exterminating the younger generation that would have taken care of them.
[01:47:59.870 --> 01:48:00.830]  That's right.
[01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:07.672]  The economic pie will be shrinking dramatically and everybody will get a smaller piece, if they're still around to enjoy it at all.
[01:48:08.657 --> 01:48:18.788]  Now I'm not really that excited about moving from a one-child to a two-child policy because what I'm going to tell everybody is the basic policy in China hasn't changed.
[01:48:18.788 --> 01:48:20.690]  Now what do I mean by the basic policy?
[01:48:20.690 --> 01:48:29.399]  The basic policy is that the Chinese state, which is to say the Chinese Communist Party, determines how many children will be born in China each year.
[01:48:30.214 --> 01:48:37.318]  And their new five-year plan calls for moving from a one-child to a two-child policy and producing more children.
[01:48:37.318 --> 01:48:42.341]  So this is childbearing under a state plan and that hasn't changed.
[01:48:42.341 --> 01:48:46.164]  This is the system owning humans like you own chickens or pigs.
[01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:47.541]  That's right.
[01:48:47.541 --> 01:48:51.984]  By breeding human beings like you breed a herd of cows or a herd of pigs.
[01:48:51.984 --> 01:48:53.065]  That's exactly it.
[01:48:53.065 --> 01:49:13.122]  It has been the case since the 1950s in China when Chairman Mao, the infamous Chairman Mao, declared that it was the proper role of the Chinese Communist Party to control reproduction of babies in the same way that they control production of tons of steel or production of number of aircraft carriers, tanks and planes.
[01:49:13.122 --> 01:49:14.003]  Same principle at work.
[01:49:14.654 --> 01:49:33.228]  And how do we learn from this with Europe's demographic cliff they've already gone over, the United States, and then we're not even importing skilled people now to replace the skilled that are dying, and I go back to the social engineers kind of wanting dumbed down menial masses that are easy to control.
[01:49:33.228 --> 01:49:40.053]  Isn't this the elite suiciding our prosperity into the future for short-term political control?
[01:49:41.963 --> 01:49:43.944]  Well, it certainly looks like that.
[01:49:43.944 --> 01:49:47.905]  I would encourage everyone to be generous in having children.
[01:49:47.905 --> 01:49:49.626]  To be fruitful and multiply.
[01:49:49.626 --> 01:49:50.806]  It's good for your family.
[01:49:50.806 --> 01:49:52.667]  It's good for the community.
[01:49:52.667 --> 01:49:54.588]  Children are the only future a family has.
[01:49:54.588 --> 01:49:56.629]  They're the only future a nation has.
[01:49:56.629 --> 01:50:03.131]  And a nation that stops having children better decide who it wants to give its country to because it obviously doesn't want it enough to populate it.
[01:50:05.367 --> 01:50:06.267]  That's right.
[01:50:06.267 --> 01:50:10.049]  Well, there's no doubt we will see the end of France within 50 years, and Germany.
[01:50:10.049 --> 01:50:11.810]  They have committed suicide.
[01:50:11.810 --> 01:50:16.492]  And I'm just upset that it's going to be radical jihadists that it's handed over to.
[01:50:18.154 --> 01:50:37.187]  Well, they have a real problem in the fact that most of their immigrants come from the Middle East, and most of their immigrants come from a very different cultural and religious background, and a lot of them can be easily radicalized and actually hate the cultures that currently exist there, and so want to supplant them, want to replace them.
[01:50:37.187 --> 01:50:38.748]  They don't want to assimilate.
[01:50:38.748 --> 01:50:42.190]  They want to fundamentally change the society that they've moved into.
[01:50:42.190 --> 01:50:44.992]  Ah, fundamentally transform the society.
[01:50:44.992 --> 01:50:46.553]  I think I heard a president say that.
[01:50:46.553 --> 01:50:47.754]  You've heard that phrase before.
[01:50:48.755 --> 01:50:49.996]  Yeah.
[01:50:49.996 --> 01:50:53.098]  Stephen Mosier, pop.org.
[01:50:53.098 --> 01:50:59.944]  For folks out there that are ignorant about population, you're not using complex algorithms or stuff to come up with these numbers.
[01:50:59.944 --> 01:51:02.206]  I mean, this is cut and dry.
[01:51:02.206 --> 01:51:03.787]  Governments admit what you're saying is true.
[01:51:03.787 --> 01:51:13.556]  You've got a lot of informational videos at pop.org that folks should share, but in the next 10 minutes we have left, explain to people the basics of demographics and what we need to just not collapse.
[01:51:15.168 --> 01:51:18.509]  Well, the basics of demographics are quite easy to understand.
[01:51:18.509 --> 01:51:21.609]  You've got only two ways that population can grow.
[01:51:21.609 --> 01:51:26.590]  That is by having babies or by welcoming immigrants.
[01:51:26.590 --> 01:51:29.151]  And there are two ways that populations can decline.
[01:51:29.151 --> 01:51:38.153]  And if you stop having babies or if you have net outflow of people, as many countries now do, then your population will shrink over time.
[01:51:38.153 --> 01:51:44.294]  But a healthy population pyramid has more people in the younger age categories than in the older age categories.
[01:51:44.804 --> 01:51:54.053]  An unhealthy population has fewer people who are young and many more people who are older are ready to go into retirement.
[01:51:54.053 --> 01:52:00.238]  And a lot of the populations of the world are moving into that category.
[01:52:00.238 --> 01:52:02.821]  Europe, of course, as you mentioned, is dying.
[01:52:02.821 --> 01:52:03.942]  But it's not just Europe.
[01:52:04.528 --> 01:52:10.850]  I mean, Latin America, which a generation ago, two generations ago, still had large families.
[01:52:10.850 --> 01:52:15.412]  Today, most of the countries in Latin America are averaging two children or fewer.
[01:52:15.412 --> 01:52:17.753]  That'll surprise some people.
[01:52:17.753 --> 01:52:23.715]  Most of the developed countries in Asia are having far fewer than two children.
[01:52:23.715 --> 01:52:26.396]  Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea.
[01:52:27.423 --> 01:52:34.510]  But because of the one-child policy in China, India is still a little above two children, but the birth rate there is falling as well.
[01:52:34.510 --> 01:52:49.002]  It seems to me that we've invented... We live in an age when most people are beginning to regard children as burdens rather than blessings, and are having too few to maintain the current populations of the countries they live in.
[01:52:49.002 --> 01:52:50.323]  You've got to have at least 2.1 children.
[01:52:51.887 --> 01:52:54.149]  To maintain the current population.
[01:52:54.149 --> 01:53:02.717]  The United States has been below that now since Roe vs. Wade, the legalization of abortion back in the early 1970s.
[01:53:02.717 --> 01:53:08.002]  And so our population is not growing as fast as it was in the 50s and 60s.
[01:53:08.002 --> 01:53:12.426]  And if it weren't for immigration, it would begin to shrink in the years to come.
[01:53:12.426 --> 01:53:15.309]  That's not a healthy sign for any people.
[01:53:16.025 --> 01:53:17.606]  And I'd like to see it reversed.
[01:53:17.606 --> 01:53:25.170]  You know, I'd like to see young couples in this country who are willing to have children, and there are quite a few, protected from taxes.
[01:53:25.170 --> 01:53:27.051]  They should be sheltered from all taxes.
[01:53:27.051 --> 01:53:35.836]  Young couples who are willing to have two or three or four children shouldn't be paying income taxes because they're spending their money and time raising the next generation of Americans.
[01:53:35.836 --> 01:53:39.598]  That's something that governments can't do and governments shouldn't be doing.
[01:53:39.598 --> 01:53:42.619]  But people will do it if you simply shelter them from taxes.
[01:53:44.011 --> 01:53:54.642]  So that's a step that I think we ought to take to stave off the demographic death that we and the other developed countries will be facing in the future if we don't do something about it.
[01:53:54.642 --> 01:54:06.874]  Does this signal, though, that the eugenicists, the Rockefellers, the folks that sold China on the one-child policy, in turn, they would then be industrialized and given a lot of power in the global system?
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:26.604]  To have China backing off of that sum and to see a lot of this now being admitted in the West, does that show there's kind of a rebellion by statisticians and government people that they now understand that a declining population will mean the pension funds won't be paid out and does mean kind of a new dark age could form?
[01:54:26.604 --> 01:54:30.965]  Because if you've got parts of the world that are already in major decline, others that are slowing down,
[01:54:32.278 --> 01:54:34.679]  Well, I'd like to see us on the moon and on Mars and in other
[01:55:02.671 --> 01:55:03.092]  I think so.
[01:55:21.505 --> 01:55:28.610]  The paradise for the radical environmentalist is really a kind of view of the Garden of Eden before the creation of Adam and Eve.
[01:55:28.610 --> 01:55:35.675]  When human beings came on the planet, he spoiled it for all the other species, so they'd like to see us eliminated.
[01:55:35.675 --> 01:55:44.060]  So there's a lot of really anti, not just anti-natal, but almost anti-human feeling on the part of some of these groups, and they don't care.
[01:55:44.060 --> 01:55:48.283]  In fact, they positively hunger for the day when humanity
[01:55:49.690 --> 01:55:54.855]  It does not be fruitful to multiply, but is barren and drastically reduced in numbers.
[01:55:54.855 --> 01:55:55.896]  That's their goal.
[01:55:55.896 --> 01:56:10.711]  Sure, Ted Turner, Prince Philip, as you know, and countless others, all these graduates in biochemistry, you name it, they write books, they have publications saying, yeah, we're going to work on an airborne Ebola, and the best thing that could happen is kill 90% of humanity.
[01:56:10.711 --> 01:56:11.092]  That's Dr. Pianca.
[01:56:13.594 --> 01:56:16.795]  Lusting after that, but of course they're not going to go.
[01:56:16.795 --> 01:56:19.636]  They're going to do the killing and then inherit the earth.
[01:56:19.636 --> 01:56:27.939]  That's really their plan, is that they just have a disdain for other humans in their cowardly, craven desire and will to power.
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:38.187]  Well, and it is true that the population controller's view of us is that there are just enough of them, you see, but there are far too many of us.
[01:56:38.187 --> 01:56:45.973]  So, their goal is to eliminate the rest of us and leave them in splendid isolation, sharing the world's wealth.
[01:56:45.973 --> 01:56:49.576]  They don't understand that wealth is created by human beings.
[01:56:49.576 --> 01:56:54.740]  If they eliminate 90% of the rest of us, the wealth that we produce will disappear along with us.
[01:56:55.180 --> 01:57:01.202]  Well, yeah, Mao killed, according to the Communist Chinese, you're an expert on it, they say 84 million, CIA says 65 million.
[01:57:01.202 --> 01:57:08.004]  I know you've been over there, you can correct me if I'm wrong or what the real number is, but they weren't failing in the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution.
[01:57:08.004 --> 01:57:16.786]  They were trying to get rid of the unruly peasants and others, and then of course, of course, stalled the whole economy and didn't mean as much caviar for the Communist leaders.
[01:57:16.786 --> 01:57:18.786]  Can you speak to that briefly?
[01:57:18.786 --> 01:57:24.008]  Well, I would say the numbers were even higher than you just cited, and I would add to those
[01:57:25.075 --> 01:57:31.942]  The 400 million Chinese, innocent Chinese, unborn who've been killed as part of the one-child policy.
[01:57:31.942 --> 01:57:38.248]  We shouldn't forget that this one-child policy was not just a matter of eugenics, it was partially that.
[01:57:38.248 --> 01:57:43.113]  It was not just a matter of population control, but it was partially that.
[01:57:43.573 --> 01:57:49.958]  It was also a matter of the Chinese Communist Party exerting control over the Chinese people.
[01:57:49.958 --> 01:58:01.647]  Because on the one hand, they backed off of the People's Communes, which had starved 42.5 million Chinese to death in the early 1960s, and they said to the farmers, you can go back and farm your own farms now.
[01:58:01.647 --> 01:58:06.770]  They backed off on economic controls a little bit, saying to some of the businessmen, you can start your own business.
[01:58:07.751 --> 01:58:27.139]  By way of compensation, they then ratcheted up controls on reproduction, you see, to maintain the muscular tone of the system, to make it clear to the people that the Chinese Communist Party, even though it was allowing family farming and private enterprise, was still in control of China because it was in the bedroom control.
[01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:30.101]  We're in control of your reproduction.
[01:58:30.101 --> 01:58:31.963]  We dominate, which is feminism.
[01:58:31.963 --> 01:58:34.405]  It's all total social engineering.
[01:58:34.405 --> 01:58:35.786]  70-second break.
[01:58:35.786 --> 01:58:37.047]  Do five more minutes with us, Steve.
[01:58:37.047 --> 01:58:37.987]  I know you gotta go then.
[01:58:37.987 --> 01:58:41.030]  pop.org, T-Intel, Infowars.com.
[01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.630]  Spread the word.
[01:58:41.630 --> 01:58:42.391]  Do it now, folks.
[01:58:42.391 --> 01:58:43.131]  We're in a fight.
[01:58:43.131 --> 01:58:43.552]  We can win.
[01:58:48.499 --> 01:58:52.022]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:58:52.022 --> 01:59:00.267]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:59:00.267 --> 01:59:05.691]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:59:05.691 --> 01:59:08.213]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:59:08.213 --> 01:59:10.334]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:59:19.469 --> 01:59:21.689]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:59:21.689 --> 01:59:26.672]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[01:59:26.672 --> 01:59:29.973]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:59:29.973 --> 01:59:33.455]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:59:33.455 --> 01:59:35.436]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:59:35.436 --> 01:59:37.556]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:59:37.556 --> 01:59:39.537]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[01:59:51.076 --> 01:59:53.701]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:04.690 --> 02:00:05.992]  Big Brother.
[02:00:05.992 --> 02:00:07.754]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.754 --> 02:00:09.536]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.536 --> 02:00:11.118]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.118 --> 02:00:12.660]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.660 --> 02:00:16.846]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.846 --> 02:00:20.911]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.833 --> 02:00:32.035]  Steven W. Mosier is our guest, the director of Pop.org.
[02:00:32.035 --> 02:00:33.235]  We've got five minutes left with you.
[02:00:33.235 --> 02:00:35.256]  I appreciate your time, sir.
[02:00:35.256 --> 02:00:41.378]  Coming up, we've got Wayne Madsen's investigative report from Arizona, out there at the aircraft boneyard.
[02:00:41.378 --> 02:00:43.739]  Well, that's tied into the CIA.
[02:00:43.739 --> 02:00:45.880]  Mr. Mosier continuing, what can we do?
[02:00:47.099 --> 02:00:48.000]  To expose this.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:49.301]  What can we do to fight this?
[02:00:49.301 --> 02:00:56.666]  Because the anti-human vitriol, the Discovery Channel shows about the world without humans and how great it'll be.
[02:00:56.666 --> 02:01:04.232]  This idea they're pushing, and young people buying into, if they kill a grandma, they get 10 jobs, as Bill Gates tells them.
[02:01:04.232 --> 02:01:08.235]  I mean, don't they understand that this is a fraud?
[02:01:08.235 --> 02:01:10.637]  How do we telegraph this message to them?
[02:01:10.637 --> 02:01:12.478]  What have you found is effective?
[02:01:12.478 --> 02:01:13.639]  Because you've been highly effective.
[02:01:15.543 --> 02:01:19.826]  Well, one thing that's effective is exposing exactly what their ultimate goals are.
[02:01:19.826 --> 02:01:27.332]  And the ultimate goal of the population control movement is not, as it has told us over the years, to simply stabilize the world's population.
[02:01:27.958 --> 02:01:30.098]  The goal is not zero population growth.
[02:01:30.098 --> 02:01:36.700]  The goal is to drive down the numbers from currently 7.2 billion down to 1 or 2 billion.
[02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:43.181]  That's the ultimate goal of the radical environmentalists, the radical feminists, the radical population growers.
[02:01:43.181 --> 02:01:47.822]  To drastically reduce our numbers and of course that would drive most of us into poverty.
[02:01:47.822 --> 02:01:53.763]  The elite of course would insulate themselves from the economic collapse that would follow from the decline in our numbers.
[02:01:54.750 --> 02:01:58.792]  The rest of the surviving population would suffer.
[02:01:58.792 --> 02:02:05.715]  You know, I mean, and that sounds like an exaggerated view of what they're all about.
[02:02:05.715 --> 02:02:15.079]  But if you read their literature, as I have, I've been forced to for the last 25 years, you see that the goal is to reduce human numbers.
[02:02:15.079 --> 02:02:19.501]  And ultimately, some of them would say, yes, extinguish human life from the planet.
[02:02:20.851 --> 02:02:23.193]  Who would enjoy the planet after we disappeared?
[02:02:23.193 --> 02:02:30.919]  I don't know, since we're the only beings endowed by God with consciousness, with an understanding of present, past, and future.
[02:02:30.919 --> 02:02:36.444]  But nonetheless, that is the goal, and it is fundamentally anti-human.
[02:02:37.214 --> 02:02:41.677]  It doesn't recognize that we are the pinnacle of creation.
[02:02:41.677 --> 02:02:44.518]  In fact, they believe that we're ruining creation.
[02:02:44.518 --> 02:02:44.959]  Exactly!
[02:02:44.959 --> 02:02:50.342]  Humans are so advanced, we could even, at a certain point, protect the Earth with advanced technologies.
[02:02:50.342 --> 02:02:51.663]  We can already do it from asteroids.
[02:02:51.663 --> 02:02:52.863]  But we're doing it.
[02:02:52.863 --> 02:02:54.284]  Yeah, we're doing it right now.
[02:02:54.284 --> 02:02:59.007]  I mean, the fact is, when you see economic devastation, it comes from poverty.
[02:02:59.739 --> 02:03:14.951]  It's the very poor who plant the last square foot of land because they're hungry, or pollute the very water they need to drink because they can't afford to build sewage treatment plants, or cut down the last tree to eat their food, or to build a house because they don't have other building materials.
[02:03:14.951 --> 02:03:21.976]  When a country reaches about $3,000 per capita, it begins to set aside the money that it needs to clean up the environment.
[02:03:22.358 --> 02:03:26.902]  And so, wealth is the way of protecting the environment.
[02:03:26.902 --> 02:03:29.224]  And to get wealth, you need people.
[02:03:29.224 --> 02:03:33.288]  So you see, their whole strategy doesn't make sense.
[02:03:33.288 --> 02:03:36.892]  If they reduce us back down to poverty, the environment will suffer.
[02:03:36.892 --> 02:03:38.493]  It will not be better off.
[02:03:38.493 --> 02:03:40.475]  It will be worse off than it was before.
[02:03:43.424 --> 02:03:44.325]  You're absolutely right.
[02:03:44.325 --> 02:03:54.413]  You can Google David Rockefeller praises Mao Zedong and find multiple New York Times articles saying, oh, it's so incredible, oh, it works so good, oh, I love it so much.
[02:03:54.413 --> 02:04:02.979]  And this is a guy who, as you pointed out, killed 80-plus million people, not to mention the one-child policy that came later, 400 million.
[02:04:02.979 --> 02:04:06.502]  The Chinese government says Mao killed that many.
[02:04:06.502 --> 02:04:08.704]  You say it's even higher.
[02:04:08.704 --> 02:04:09.785]  Where do you come up with those numbers?
[02:04:11.072 --> 02:04:21.950]  Well, first of all, Mao Zedong was the reason for the Chinese Civil War lasting for over 20 years, which killed 50, 60 million people.
[02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:23.092]  Wow, so we're talking now we're at 130 million.
[02:04:24.372 --> 02:04:39.319]  Then, yes, then with the takeover of China by the Red Army, by Mao's peasant army, he went into the villages and basically lined up the rich peasants and landlords and had them all killed.
[02:04:39.319 --> 02:04:41.380]  That was another 10-12 million deaths.
[02:04:41.380 --> 02:04:46.723]  Now, in the village I was first in, in China, in 1979, there was a little hill outside the village
[02:04:47.083 --> 02:04:47.903]  You've heard of the U.S.
[02:04:47.903 --> 02:04:53.225]  government wasting money on studies like mountain lions on treadmills, shrimp on treadmills, and even the effects of Swedish massage on rabbits.
[02:04:53.225 --> 02:04:54.805]  This latest example of waste comes out of the Illinois EPA.
[02:04:54.805 --> 02:04:56.946]  In fact, I tweeted, That's right, it's all in the article.
[02:05:16.471 --> 02:05:17.372]  Illinois EPA.
[02:05:17.372 --> 02:05:20.494]  Pumpkins must be managed to protect human health by Kit Daniels.
[02:05:20.494 --> 02:05:26.719]  And in it, you can find a link to the actual nine-step process for local cities to collect pumpkins for composting.
[02:05:26.719 --> 02:05:27.699]  Here's step two.
[02:05:27.699 --> 02:05:34.624]  Pumpkins must not be accepted from other persons, including, but not limited to, owners and operators of rented or leased residences where pumpkins were used for decorative purposes.
[02:05:34.624 --> 02:05:38.267]  Commercial haulers and other commercial, industrial, agricultural, and government operations are entities.
[02:05:38.407 --> 02:05:39.388]  How are you going to figure that out?
[02:05:39.388 --> 02:05:40.949]  Did you see the memo about this?
[02:05:40.949 --> 02:05:41.089]  Okay.

[02:06:02.504 --> 02:06:08.807]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:06:08.807 --> 02:06:15.790]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.

[02:06:34.865 --> 02:06:36.206]  Adenosylcobalamin.
[02:06:36.206 --> 02:06:39.807]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:06:39.807 --> 02:06:41.688]  No needles, no injections.
[02:06:41.688 --> 02:06:43.349]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:06:43.349 --> 02:06:44.529]  Try it for yourself.

[02:07:59.079 --> 02:08:00.361]  Thanks for watching!
[02:08:10.772 --> 02:08:13.355]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:13.355 --> 02:08:16.577]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:16.577 --> 02:08:20.681]  He heads up the Population Research Institute, Stephen W. Mosher.
[02:08:20.681 --> 02:08:25.245]  China is backed off its one-child policy, gone to a two-child policy, because it's hurting their economy.
[02:08:25.245 --> 02:08:27.767]  You have less people to take care of the old.
[02:08:27.767 --> 02:08:30.610]  He's got to go in just a few minutes, and we've got Wayne Madsen's report coming up.
[02:08:30.610 --> 02:08:33.993]  We talked about the Chinese government says Mao killed 84 million people.
[02:08:33.993 --> 02:08:35.494]  But then the Civil War, he killed another 30, 40, 50 million.
[02:08:36.896 --> 02:08:43.535]  Then you add another 10 million being all the peasant leaders, anybody middle class, and you were describing seeing that in a village.
[02:08:43.535 --> 02:08:44.517]  Finish your story, please, sir.
[02:08:45.714 --> 02:08:55.658]  Well, in the village that I studied in 1979, I was taken out by elderly villagers to a little hill outside the village where there was a mass grave.
[02:08:55.658 --> 02:09:07.562]  And here it was where the landlords, those people who owned a few acres of land, these weren't large landlords, and the rich peasants, those were people who just hired labor part of the year for harvesting or planting.
[02:09:07.562 --> 02:09:10.383]  They were taken out and struggled and executed.
[02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:20.572]  Uh, that was also the place where 200 victims of the famine, uh, that, uh, was caused by the great proletarian people's communes, uh, were buried.
[02:09:20.572 --> 02:09:26.493]  There were 200 people in my village of about 3,000 people who died of starvation during that period.
[02:09:26.493 --> 02:09:32.114]  Overall numbers in China, uh, during the Great Famine of 1960 to 1962 were about 42.5 million people who starved to death.
[02:09:32.114 --> 02:09:32.934]  Uh, Chairman Mao said, uh,
[02:09:37.782 --> 02:09:39.964]  When there's not enough to eat, people starve to death.
[02:09:39.964 --> 02:09:43.446]  It's better to let half the people die so the other half can eat their filth.
[02:09:43.446 --> 02:09:47.950]  That's a direct quote from the great Chinese leader, Chairman Mao.
[02:09:47.950 --> 02:09:48.871]  How communist!
[02:09:48.871 --> 02:09:49.891]  How sweet!
[02:09:49.891 --> 02:09:52.173]  How moral authority these people are!
[02:09:52.173 --> 02:09:52.834]  It's sickening!
[02:09:53.936 --> 02:09:55.677]  Well, they're totally immoral, of course.
[02:09:55.677 --> 02:09:56.717]  It's all about power.
[02:09:56.717 --> 02:10:02.179]  This is the guy who said political power comes from the barrel of a gun, and that a revolution is not a dinner party.
[02:10:02.179 --> 02:10:10.802]  He also said one-tenth of the peasants of China, or about 50 million people, would have to be destroyed in order to set up a people's commune.
[02:10:10.802 --> 02:10:13.063]  And, of course, he pretty much reached that number.
[02:10:13.063 --> 02:10:16.825]  So, this is a mass murder.
[02:10:16.825 --> 02:10:20.806]  And the successors to Mao are people who are cut from the same cloth.
[02:10:20.806 --> 02:10:22.787]  The current president of China is Xi Jinping.
[02:10:23.453 --> 02:10:36.319]  He is very much an admirer of Chairman Mao, has modeled his political career on Chairman Mao, and is not at all bashful about eliminating people who stand in his way.
[02:10:36.319 --> 02:10:39.880]  Now they just do it in the womb or after they're born, and it's called a right.
[02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:42.782]  Pop.org, Stephen Mosier, thank you.
[02:10:42.782 --> 02:10:44.002]  Look forward to having you back on.
[02:10:44.002 --> 02:10:45.763]  Your work could not be more important.
[02:10:45.763 --> 02:10:47.364]  Godspeed.
[02:10:47.364 --> 02:10:47.684]  Thank you.
[02:10:48.450 --> 02:10:55.297]  Truly amazing, and folks, you should take this resource, pop.org, and our film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:10:55.297 --> 02:10:56.238]  Give it out to everybody you know.
[02:10:56.238 --> 02:10:59.001]  This is a real fight for humanity.
[02:10:59.001 --> 02:11:03.205]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's go to the special report shot a week and a half ago.
[02:11:03.205 --> 02:11:10.533]  We're premiering it here in the field in Arizona with commentary with investigative journalist Wayne Madsen.
[02:11:11.912 --> 02:11:16.514]  Relatives and friends stunned by a violent crime in Calaveras County.
[02:11:16.514 --> 02:11:22.076]  Investigators say a father killed his two teenage sons before turning the gun on himself.
[02:11:22.076 --> 02:11:28.978]  Investigators also believe their own father, Phillip Marshall, shot them, the family dog, then turned the gun on himself.
[02:11:39.036 --> 02:11:44.220]  In 2012, the late Phil Marshall, he wrote three books.
[02:11:44.220 --> 02:11:55.508]  Two about his doubts about the official 9-11 report and one about a docudrama, actually, about his time as a pilot for the CIA in the 1980s.
[02:11:55.508 --> 02:12:05.114]  In his books, the veteran aviation pilots accused the administration of former US President George W. Bush of orchestrating the 9-11 attacks.
[02:12:05.114 --> 02:12:05.695]  Marshall said,
[02:12:06.511 --> 02:12:15.014]  The true reason the attack was successful is because of an inside military stand-down and a coordinated training operation that prepared the hijackers to fly heavy commercial airliners.
[02:12:15.014 --> 02:12:23.597]  We have dozens of FBI documents to prove that this flight training was conducted in California, Florida, and Arizona in the 18 months leading up to the attack.
[02:12:23.597 --> 02:12:24.938]  Think about this.
[02:12:24.938 --> 02:12:33.841]  The official version about some ghost in some cave on the other side of the world defeating our entire military establishment on US soil is absolutely preposterous.
[02:12:34.421 --> 02:12:42.083]  Phil Marshall, qualified Boeing 757 pilot and a Boeing 767 pilot.
[02:12:42.083 --> 02:12:48.685]  The two aircraft, as we know, are said to have allegedly been involved in the 9-11 attacks.
[02:12:48.685 --> 02:12:50.666]  Phil Marshall came here to Arizona in 2012.
[02:12:53.086 --> 02:13:09.713]  Specifically, to investigate leads that he picked up about the role that a former and probably current Central Intelligence Agency facility called the Pinal Air Park in Marana, Arizona, between Phoenix and Tucson.
[02:13:09.713 --> 02:13:16.636]  Phil Marshall came here to investigate leads, as I mentioned, that would have questioned the official 9-11 story.
[02:13:17.976 --> 02:13:28.175]  And it was these leads, this information that Phil Marshall obtained at the Pinal Airpark that ultimately led to his death.
[02:13:29.392 --> 02:13:34.535]  The deaths of his teenage son, his teenage daughter, and even the family dog.
[02:13:34.535 --> 02:13:47.963]  The Calaveras County Sheriff concluded that Phil Marshall, with a mix of alcohol and drugs, went into a rage, killed his two children, killed the family dog, and then turned the gun on himself.
[02:13:47.963 --> 02:13:50.885]  After our investigation here at the Pinal Airpark,
[02:13:51.705 --> 02:13:52.805]  Uh, where we spend time.
[02:13:52.805 --> 02:13:57.827]  It's quite clear that Pinal does hold the key to the 9-11 mystery.
[02:13:57.827 --> 02:14:02.248]  There have been attacks in two American cities, New York and in Washington.
[02:14:02.248 --> 02:14:06.108]  The trade centers here in New York have been hit by airplanes.
[02:14:06.108 --> 02:14:09.329]  In Washington, there is a large fire at the Pentagon.
[02:14:09.329 --> 02:14:12.030]  The Pentagon has been evacuated.
[02:14:12.030 --> 02:14:20.572]  And there, as you can see, perhaps the second tower, the front tower, the top portion of which is collapsing.
[02:14:20.572 --> 02:14:20.972]  Good Lord.
[02:14:22.185 --> 02:14:27.648]  At Canal, which has seen a different ownership over the years.
[02:14:27.648 --> 02:14:34.152]  At one time, it was a facility where several CIA airlines were based.
[02:14:34.152 --> 02:14:51.603]  These airline companies were organized by George Dooley, the CIA man who created Civil Air Transport, Southern Air Transport, Air America, from the movie by the same name, starring Mel Gibson.
[02:14:52.423 --> 02:14:54.084]  Also, Intermountain Aviation.
[02:14:54.084 --> 02:15:00.567]  Phil Marshall, of course, had some dealings working with Intermountain Aviation out of Maine, Arkansas.
[02:15:00.567 --> 02:15:09.612]  So, then it became Evergreen International, and now it's known as the Marana Aerospace Solutions.
[02:15:09.612 --> 02:15:16.355]  But before it became Marana Aerospace Solutions, Evergreen, which was a CIA proprietary company, sold
[02:15:17.615 --> 02:15:37.906]  It's assets to a company called Relativity LLC out of Virginia, specifically out of Arlington, Virginia, located in the Roslyn area where a lot of CIA operations are located, front companies, and Relativity turns out it's owned by the Carlyle Group.
[02:15:37.906 --> 02:15:39.286]  Yes, that Carlyle Group.
[02:15:39.286 --> 02:15:40.127]  The Carlyle Group
[02:15:40.547 --> 02:16:04.305]  That was partly owned by the Bin Laden family and the Bush family that figured so prominently over the years and not only everything including the support for Saddam Hussein in the 1980s and his war with Iran but also now as we discovered Carlisle played a significant role in the 9-11 mystery.
[02:16:04.305 --> 02:16:08.027]  Beyond being the boneyard for these aircraft that
[02:16:10.345 --> 02:16:18.052]  The Marana facility also what they do there is they bring planes in to do quick maintenance.
[02:16:18.052 --> 02:16:28.243]  They take planes in there to do maintenance and then putting them in storage and then from storage these aircraft can be put back into active service.
[02:16:28.243 --> 02:16:30.345]  But also what we learned is that
[02:16:31.105 --> 02:16:44.172]  At the Pinal Airpark, they have the capability to fabricate new parts and take parts from different aircraft and cobble them together to create what might be called a drop plane.
[02:16:44.172 --> 02:16:55.379]  We all know that a drop gun is pieces of various weapons put together to create a new weapon, which there's no obvious track record for.
[02:16:55.379 --> 02:16:57.640]  The serial numbers are shaved off.
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:16:59.541]  Well, the same thing can be done to an aircraft.
[02:17:00.422 --> 02:17:13.652]  It's quite clear that the capability at the Pinal Airpark included taking parts of planes and creating new aircraft, which of course could have drone technology then put in place.
[02:17:13.652 --> 02:17:18.917]  Here's the Air Force General talking to Congress on C-SPAN about remote controlling of aircraft.
[02:17:18.917 --> 02:17:23.721]  Because, see, if they can remote control them, they can nerve gas everybody and remote control them into the buildings.
[02:17:24.744 --> 02:17:32.174]  And all it takes is a very small group of people that have the codes to do it, and then the rest of the military thinks, hey, Mohammed Adda and all these guys got on the planes.
[02:17:32.174 --> 02:17:34.538]  They're taking part in the drill, which we know is going on.
[02:17:35.888 --> 02:17:36.648]  See how that works?
[02:17:36.648 --> 02:17:37.569]  Let's go to the clip.
[02:17:37.569 --> 02:17:41.130]  Missiles with inert warheads and other sophisticated gear.
[02:17:41.130 --> 02:18:04.958]  What have you guys done to equip our air guard and other NORAD potentially assigned units with the training, with the rules of engagement, and the hardware that gives them an option other than what we have now, which is just to destroy the aircraft and all its passengers?
[02:18:05.638 --> 02:18:15.606]  I'm aware of at least one program which is classified so we can either talk about it offline or provide you the classified paper on it.
[02:18:15.606 --> 02:18:19.349]  There may be others to do exactly that.
[02:18:19.349 --> 02:18:21.371]  Okay, and people say, oh no, they're talking about missiles there.
[02:18:21.371 --> 02:18:21.971]  No, they're not.
[02:18:21.971 --> 02:18:24.513]  Here's Bush in PBS.
[02:18:24.513 --> 02:18:26.375]  Bush announces new security measures.
[02:18:28.376 --> 02:18:33.698]  To enable air traffic controllers to take over a distressed aircraft and land it by remote control, okay?
[02:18:33.698 --> 02:18:35.399]  That's what the program is.
[02:18:35.399 --> 02:18:36.859]  That's what's going on.
[02:18:36.859 --> 02:18:57.968]  What Phil Marshall, who was qualified on both aircraft, obviously discovered in his own investigation was that there was a distinct possibility that some of the aircraft used, or all of the aircraft used on 9-11, were hybrid aircraft created for the purpose of being droned and being put into the
[02:18:58.508 --> 02:19:00.749]  For InfoWars.com, I'm Wayne Mattson.
[02:19:21.357 --> 02:19:27.219]  And again it's very powerful video because really nobody's ever gotten into that base until now.

[02:20:58.052 --> 02:21:01.354]  This is a message for men concerned about prostate health.

[02:21:17.526 --> 02:21:19.747]  Do you wake up at night to urinate?

[02:21:51.983 --> 02:21:55.265]  1-800-935-6435.
[02:21:55.265 --> 02:22:10.912]  Atmospheric aluminum, mercury exposure, estrogen toxins from plastics, microwaves from cell phones and smart meters, and low quality foods, all combined to create conditions for the very high incidence of disease in our society.
[02:22:10.912 --> 02:22:11.652]  Now more than ever,
[02:22:11.812 --> 02:22:19.435]  We all need to be consuming those foods and herbs that epigenetically signal the cells of our body to produce energy, create proteins, and detoxify.
[02:22:19.435 --> 02:22:25.417]  When we properly support our bodies, then even in these toxic times, we can promote and achieve excellent health.
[02:22:25.417 --> 02:22:27.718]  One World Way is the first energetically encoded
[02:22:28.058 --> 02:22:28.638]  I think so.
[02:22:59.136 --> 02:23:03.098]  Thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day.
[02:23:03.098 --> 02:23:07.139]  And the home security industry wants you to believe that's your only option.
[02:23:07.139 --> 02:23:12.602]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.
[02:23:12.602 --> 02:23:17.504]  You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.
[02:23:17.504 --> 02:23:21.025]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.

[02:24:09.463 --> 02:24:10.563]  Well, we got a stool.
[02:24:10.563 --> 02:24:13.544]  Bunch of breaking news here.
[02:24:13.544 --> 02:24:18.485]  We've got five stabbed on California University campus.
[02:24:18.485 --> 02:24:21.186]  Suspect fatally shot by the police.
[02:24:21.186 --> 02:24:25.727]  Another place in California, the police have pinned down somebody that shot at the police.
[02:24:25.727 --> 02:24:27.487]  So we'll follow that as it unfolds.
[02:24:27.487 --> 02:24:29.328]  Will they make a big deal out of this?
[02:24:29.328 --> 02:24:30.588]  No, because it's not a gun.
[02:24:34.164 --> 02:24:35.586]  And a gun stopped him.
[02:24:35.586 --> 02:24:36.888]  So, you won't be hearing a lot about that.
[02:24:36.888 --> 02:24:38.891]  They'll report on it a little bit, but that'll be it.
[02:24:38.891 --> 02:24:40.553]  Won't be any calls for banning knives.
[02:24:40.553 --> 02:24:42.315]  Actually, in England, they're trying that.
[02:24:42.315 --> 02:24:43.357]  Shifting gears.
[02:24:43.357 --> 02:24:45.500]  Ghost war in Syria!
[02:24:45.500 --> 02:24:47.262]  Russian Special Forces facing U.S.
[02:24:47.262 --> 02:24:48.504]  Army Special Forces.
[02:24:48.504 --> 02:24:50.286]  There's bound to be some shooting.
[02:24:51.147 --> 02:25:05.061]  And the article breaks down the two sides have been placed on a collision course and it goes over the fight card where you've got the announcement of the United States to back the rebels and the Russians to fight the rebels and the fact that U.S.
[02:25:05.061 --> 02:25:14.051]  Special Forces are being put into positions where they will end up probably getting killed and then the media can say all the Russians killed our troops.
[02:25:16.041 --> 02:25:17.141]  In the blue corner, the U.S.
[02:25:17.141 --> 02:25:22.783]  Special Forces quote, this is their quote from CENTCOM, will work with resistance forces.
[02:25:22.783 --> 02:25:28.025]  Red corner, Russian spit stats, preparing for ground assault on rebels.
[02:25:28.025 --> 02:25:30.366]  And then placed on a collision course.
[02:25:30.366 --> 02:25:37.788]  And I said this at the time, folks pointed it out, everything the globalists do, they do multi-facet.
[02:25:39.167 --> 02:25:48.576]  So yes, Jade Helm was about overseas and infiltrating, but it was also about domestically infiltrating as well.
[02:25:48.576 --> 02:25:57.325]  And we put together maps, others did, we can put it on screen, from the official Jade Helm PowerPoint of July and August and September.
[02:25:59.059 --> 02:26:09.307]  Where if you turn the American Southwest on its side, it's a perfect map of Israel, with the Palestinian West Bank being in red, Syria being Utah.
[02:26:11.219 --> 02:26:22.465]  Iraq being New Mexico, Iran being Texas, and then you've got Jordan being Arizona.
[02:26:22.465 --> 02:26:24.686]  And it matches up.
[02:26:24.686 --> 02:26:29.768]  Lebanon are buddies, Israel are buddies, Jordan are buddies, Turkey are buddies, it all fits perfectly.
[02:26:29.768 --> 02:26:36.192]  New Mexico is contested, that's what they're saying about Iraq, and that is what it is.
[02:26:36.792 --> 02:26:41.995]  So they can tell the troops at one level, you're practicing, you know, moving troops and forces around in the states.
[02:26:41.995 --> 02:26:44.076]  They show them this map.
[02:26:44.076 --> 02:26:46.737]  But then it's got multifaceted usages as well.
[02:26:46.737 --> 02:26:48.558]  But it's done as a psyopsy.
[02:26:48.558 --> 02:26:50.019]  Jones says it's a takeover.
[02:26:50.019 --> 02:26:51.959]  They're taking Texas guns.
[02:26:51.959 --> 02:26:52.620]  Doesn't happen.
[02:26:52.620 --> 02:26:54.020]  They want to discredit me to the military.
[02:26:54.020 --> 02:26:54.581]  Never said that.
[02:26:54.581 --> 02:26:55.621]  Military knows that.
[02:26:55.621 --> 02:26:56.642]  Still, I try.
[02:26:56.642 --> 02:27:00.304]  But then also, it's used as a practice to move weapons around.
[02:27:00.304 --> 02:27:02.204]  And that's what you see happening right now.
[02:27:02.204 --> 02:27:02.925]  That's how they do it.
[02:27:03.956 --> 02:27:08.278]  So there's another layer of Jade Helm, but those are other sub-layers.
[02:27:08.278 --> 02:27:11.640]  The big layer is what they admit in their PowerPoints at the Pentagon.
[02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:22.685]  It's about mastering the human domain, tracking in databases, using social media and other systems, every person in every town, and the different political stratas, and who to deal with, who to control.
[02:27:22.685 --> 02:27:26.688]  That's what's happening in this situation.
[02:27:26.688 --> 02:27:31.350]  So there is the rest of the story on Jade Helm, a multifaceted psy-op.
[02:27:32.486 --> 02:27:36.273]  About 10 stories tall, about 10 different levels to it.
[02:27:36.273 --> 02:27:37.175]  How many guns?
[02:27:37.175 --> 02:27:38.939]  I'd say about 20 guns.
[02:27:38.939 --> 02:27:41.343]  Some on the surface, some on the towers.
[02:27:41.343 --> 02:27:43.007]  As above, so below.
[02:27:43.007 --> 02:27:44.269]  America's ground war!
[02:27:46.698 --> 02:27:51.483]  Against or in support of the Islamic State, ISIS supplied via Turkey a U.S.
[02:27:51.483 --> 02:27:54.126]  excuse to seize Syria.
[02:27:54.126 --> 02:27:56.087]  ISIS is being supplied via Turkey.
[02:27:56.087 --> 02:28:00.212]  And notice ISIS has taken the middle corridor out of Iraq up to Turkey.
[02:28:00.212 --> 02:28:01.573]  So now the U.S.
[02:28:01.573 --> 02:28:08.280]  has to take that over and split the country in two to do exactly what ISIS already did to protect us from ISIS.
[02:28:09.830 --> 02:28:18.136]  And just like the Kunduz airlift of evil in 2001, they fly the real Al Qaeda out to the next country to stir up trouble again.
[02:28:18.136 --> 02:28:24.741]  And then it's replicated over and over again, and the plan's so Machiavelli, the public can't grasp it.
[02:28:24.741 --> 02:28:27.543]  Though it's not that Machiavelli, it's not that sophisticated.
[02:28:28.949 --> 02:28:43.415]  If you're willing to turn jihadis loose to kill hundreds of thousands of Christians, which the people running our government aren't just willing, they're as pleased as eating a big ol' slice of pumpkin pie with whipped cream on top.
[02:28:43.415 --> 02:28:52.519]  I mean, killing is the business of Christians, you know, killing Christians is their business, and that business is good, good, good, goody, goody gumdrops.
[02:28:55.208 --> 02:29:00.390]  There's a video I'm not going to play, but it is shocking, just to show how controlled these crazy people are.
[02:29:00.390 --> 02:29:04.632]  ISIS suicide bomber cut in half as he fails to make his target.
[02:29:04.632 --> 02:29:07.354]  There's video of this, HD video of it.
[02:29:07.354 --> 02:29:15.277]  Dying man who is missing his legs is filmed by a crowd of stunned men in the street.
[02:29:15.277 --> 02:29:18.439]  Continuing, Europe still angry at US spying.
[02:29:20.034 --> 02:29:22.916]  Prepares to increase its own spying.
[02:29:22.916 --> 02:29:24.377]  Oh yeah, they're all doing the same thing.
[02:29:24.377 --> 02:29:26.919]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:29:26.919 --> 02:29:28.460]  Continuing here, judicial.
[02:29:30.066 --> 02:29:31.407]  Well, I'm gonna break this down when we come back.
[02:29:31.407 --> 02:29:34.870]  We've got a special guest joining us in the studio as well.
[02:29:34.870 --> 02:29:39.774]  And I haven't really gotten into Microsoft admits Windows 10 automatically spying cannot be stopped.
[02:29:39.774 --> 02:29:42.076]  It's built to do it that way.
[02:29:42.076 --> 02:29:47.460]  And also, Verizon is scanning and reading all your emails and censoring them and rewriting them.
[02:29:47.460 --> 02:29:48.141]  Not just spying.
[02:29:48.141 --> 02:29:49.402]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.402 --> 02:29:51.924]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.924 --> 02:29:54.626]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.221 --> 02:30:03.821]  In Florida they call me Jeb because I earned it.
[02:30:03.821 --> 02:30:04.842]  Poor Jeb.
[02:30:04.842 --> 02:30:09.063]  I got a lot of really cool things that I could do other than sit around being miserable.
[02:30:09.063 --> 02:30:10.803]  Jeb just got some more bad news.
[02:30:10.803 --> 02:30:18.085]  While both Trump and Carson would beat Hillary in Florida, former Florida Governor Jeb would lose to Hillary in the Republican-leaning state.
[02:30:20.626 --> 02:30:25.089]  And with that news, Jeb's exclamation mark went completely flaccid.
[02:30:25.089 --> 02:30:27.030]  And his comments got even stranger.
[02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:28.131]  I love my dad.
[02:30:28.131 --> 02:30:28.972]  I'd kill for him.
[02:30:28.972 --> 02:30:31.173]  I'd go to prison for him because I love him so much.
[02:30:31.173 --> 02:30:34.435]  Well, I'm sure that comes up around the Bush dinner table, but come on.
[02:30:34.435 --> 02:30:37.257]  The Bushes, just like the Clintons, are too big to jail.
[02:30:37.257 --> 02:30:38.998]  They called me Vito Corleone.
[02:30:38.998 --> 02:30:40.239]  More like Fredo.
[02:30:40.239 --> 02:30:43.942]  Jeb's campaign finance woes highlight a problem with super PACs.
[02:30:43.942 --> 02:30:48.605]  Candidates can't pay their staff from super PACs because they presumably don't control them.
[02:30:49.045 --> 02:30:55.027]  An election is an advanced auction of stolen goods, and the Super PACs are where you place your bets.
[02:30:55.027 --> 02:30:55.387]  For F.O.
[02:30:55.387 --> 02:30:56.948]  Wars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[02:30:56.948 --> 02:30:58.488]  I got the horse right here!

[02:32:51.095 --> 02:32:54.856]  Nothing is easy, nothing good is free, but I can tell you where to start.
[02:33:14.108 --> 02:33:21.802]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:25.880 --> 02:33:33.964]  Constitutional lawyer Adam Lowy will be joining us to cover the most incredible federalization of police I've ever seen.
[02:33:33.964 --> 02:33:37.885]  I mean, this is really diabolical.
[02:33:37.885 --> 02:33:39.806]  He is the guy that is handling the case.
[02:33:39.806 --> 02:33:40.907]  It's got national attention.
[02:33:40.907 --> 02:33:42.407]  He's right here in Austin, Texas.
[02:33:42.407 --> 02:33:44.188]  We're going to go to him here in just a moment.
[02:33:44.188 --> 02:33:45.629]  He'll be with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:33:45.629 --> 02:33:50.771]  Then, in the fourth hour, hosted by David Knight that we've added, his affiliates wanted a fourth hour.
[02:33:52.005 --> 02:34:04.975]  There's been a lot of talk about China-friendly propaganda radio, secretly operating in the U.S., but did you know that there are exiled Islamic imam pushing a transnational Islamic State caliphate, was given safe harbor in the U.S.
[02:34:04.975 --> 02:34:10.220]  by CIA letters of recrimination, and that his network of charter schools in the U.S.
[02:34:10.220 --> 02:34:17.305]  pushes Turkey-friendly, Islamic-friendly propaganda, and in Texas alone, he's been receiving close to $100 million.
[02:34:20.868 --> 02:34:22.049]  of tax money annually.
[02:34:22.049 --> 02:34:24.290]  We're going to go to this compound and cover this.
[02:34:24.290 --> 02:34:25.451]  This is real.
[02:34:25.451 --> 02:34:27.952]  This is insane asylum level stuff.
[02:34:27.952 --> 02:34:34.476]  Also, Paul Ryan's now talking about Planned Parenthood funding and military buildup with Republicans like this.
[02:34:34.476 --> 02:34:36.377]  Who needs Democrats, huh?
[02:34:36.377 --> 02:34:41.160]  Rob Dew will also be joining him to talk about communities choosing to take out fluoride in the water and more.
[02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:48.105]  It's a big fourth hour that you don't want to miss as we reload, energize, and cover all the latest breaking news.
[02:34:49.045 --> 02:34:52.448]  Now, Adam Loewy is our guest.
[02:34:52.448 --> 02:34:57.432]  Loewyfirm.com, L-O-E-W-Y dot com.
[02:34:57.432 --> 02:35:03.376]  He has been involved in a lot of high profile cases in Central Texas.
[02:35:03.376 --> 02:35:05.378]  And he goes after bad cops.
[02:35:05.378 --> 02:35:09.121]  Now everybody knows that I am not an enemy of the police.
[02:35:09.121 --> 02:35:12.343]  I don't follow the George Soros thing to federalize them and say go shoot the cops.
[02:35:12.343 --> 02:35:12.944]  He isn't either.
[02:35:14.137 --> 02:35:18.560]  But when police shoot an unarmed guy in the back and he doesn't get in trouble, he's there covering it.
[02:35:18.560 --> 02:35:23.783]  Now, the police officer had gotten in trouble, but the judge just dismissed it all and said no jurisdiction.
[02:35:23.783 --> 02:35:25.104]  Basically, the feds decide this.
[02:35:25.104 --> 02:35:30.207]  Now, whether the cop's good or did the right thing or was bad, we'll talk about that some, too.
[02:35:30.207 --> 02:35:31.328]  It's a terrible case.
[02:35:31.328 --> 02:35:32.389]  A bank robbery.
[02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:33.909]  Chases some guy that's scared of the cops.
[02:35:33.909 --> 02:35:35.070]  I can kind of see why.
[02:35:35.070 --> 02:35:35.791]  Shoots him in the back.
[02:35:36.911 --> 02:35:40.133]  Uh, didn't get in trouble for it so far.
[02:35:40.133 --> 02:35:42.615]  Uh, and you got a lot of courage, you know, for trying to tackle this.
[02:35:42.615 --> 02:35:44.576]  And as good as our police departments are in Austin...
[02:35:45.782 --> 02:35:46.763]  They still got a lot of problems.
[02:35:46.763 --> 02:35:49.084]  There's some, obviously, a lot worse around the country.
[02:35:49.084 --> 02:36:07.118]  But that said, for me the big issue, and when he contacted us, I've been inviting him on lately, he's been too busy, but he called and said, I'll come on now because of this ruling, because this is right up your alley, here's the headline, how federal agents can kill someone and avoid prosecution, the Washington Post.
[02:36:07.118 --> 02:36:09.039]  And it's this special federal clause.
[02:36:09.039 --> 02:36:09.540]  Well now,
[02:36:10.914 --> 02:36:19.841]  Local police can just be under a federal umbrella, and if they're playing ball with the feds, a magic wand is waved, and they're above the law.
[02:36:19.841 --> 02:36:25.465]  They've done this with Asset Forfeiture Seizure, where they won't let locals keep the money, but if it's done federally, then you can keep it.
[02:36:25.465 --> 02:36:26.766]  That makes you federal creatures.
[02:36:26.766 --> 02:36:29.087]  So this is very sophisticated.
[02:36:29.087 --> 02:36:30.228]  Adam, thanks for coming in.
[02:36:30.228 --> 02:36:31.249]  Good to see you, Alex.
[02:36:31.249 --> 02:36:36.893]  Where should we start with the case, or with the ruling, and in general?
[02:36:36.893 --> 02:36:37.694]  I just can't think of
[02:36:38.581 --> 02:36:50.508]  Just anything bigger than this lately with federalization and then there's almost no coverage of such an incredible, incredible ruling of no local jurisdiction over police.
[02:36:50.508 --> 02:36:53.190]  That is quite a statement by a court.
[02:36:53.190 --> 02:36:53.770]  Absolutely.
[02:36:53.770 --> 02:36:57.593]  Let me just briefly go through the facts as we know them.
[02:36:57.593 --> 02:37:04.157]  This was a case in which there was a bank robbery in the morning by a white guy about eight hours later.
[02:37:04.457 --> 02:37:08.141]  Larry Jackson, who was African American, came to the bank.
[02:37:08.141 --> 02:37:10.143]  The bank was shut down.
[02:37:10.143 --> 02:37:16.669]  The APD officer, Austin Police Department Detective Charles Kleiner, was in the bank doing an investigation.
[02:37:16.669 --> 02:37:19.552]  Larry tried to enter the bank.
[02:37:19.552 --> 02:37:20.733]  The door was locked.
[02:37:20.733 --> 02:37:22.415]  Kleiner comes out and confronts him.
[02:37:22.415 --> 02:37:23.135]  Larry runs.
[02:37:24.076 --> 02:37:25.517]  Cliner chases him.
[02:37:25.517 --> 02:37:28.919]  Cliner got commandeered a civilian car.
[02:37:28.919 --> 02:37:34.903]  Literally something out of the 1980s, he forces this older woman to drive him, chasing Larry.
[02:37:34.903 --> 02:37:37.485]  He then gets Larry under a bridge.
[02:37:37.485 --> 02:37:38.926]  And by the way, this has all been admitted.
[02:37:38.926 --> 02:37:40.447]  It's all been admitted, under oath.
[02:37:41.247 --> 02:37:56.319]  Under a bridge, Kleinert takes his gun out, starts striking Larry in the head, and the forensic evidence clearly shows that Larry was on his hands and knees when Kleinert put the gun to the back of his neck and pulled the trigger.
[02:37:56.319 --> 02:38:01.223]  The muzzle, the muzzle of the gun was on Larry's neck.
[02:38:01.923 --> 02:38:02.763]  Those are the facts.
[02:38:02.763 --> 02:38:06.805]  What Kleinert claimed from the beginning was this was an accident.
[02:38:06.805 --> 02:38:09.926]  That he did not mean to shoot Larry Jackson.
[02:38:09.926 --> 02:38:11.006]  Was this a psychotic break?
[02:38:11.006 --> 02:38:14.928]  Like the guy in San Francisco shoots the black guy in the back and then lies about it?
[02:38:14.928 --> 02:38:16.689]  I think he was in a state of rage.
[02:38:16.689 --> 02:38:18.469]  I think he totally flipped out.
[02:38:18.469 --> 02:38:19.950]  It was in July of 2013.
[02:38:19.950 --> 02:38:22.971]  It was 108 degrees that day.
[02:38:22.971 --> 02:38:24.211]  I just think he lost it.
[02:38:24.211 --> 02:38:25.852]  He did not want this guy running from him.
[02:38:26.652 --> 02:38:29.313]  Uh, and he completely lost it, and I believe murdered him.
[02:38:29.313 --> 02:38:32.814]  I think the evidence is overwhelming that this was intentional.
[02:38:32.814 --> 02:38:33.794]  And we're showing video.
[02:38:33.794 --> 02:38:36.015]  This, this, this, the guy he chased didn't do anything.
[02:38:36.015 --> 02:38:36.375]  Right.
[02:38:36.375 --> 02:38:45.538]  And under oath, under oath, Kleiner admitted that Larry Jackson was not a threat, that Larry Jackson, uh, did not pose a danger to him.
[02:38:45.538 --> 02:38:48.079]  That is under oath testimony from federal court.
[02:38:48.079 --> 02:38:48.719]  Wow.
[02:38:48.719 --> 02:38:50.860]  And so he was indicted for manslaughter.
[02:38:51.520 --> 02:39:07.271]  And then, due to a very arcane law, literally from the 1800s, called Supremacy Clause Immunity, his lawyers appeal it to federal court and they claimed that, first of all, Kleinert was a federal agent because he was on a joint task force.
[02:39:07.831 --> 02:39:22.939]  Which is he wasn't an FBI agent, he wasn't paid by the federal government, but there's all these joint task forces now in which the feds use local police officers and simply designate them as a federal agent for purposes of a task force.
[02:39:22.939 --> 02:39:25.480]  And this is a kill somebody get out of jail free card now.
[02:39:25.700 --> 02:39:41.996]  Right, and so because he was a federal officer, he can be entitled to supremacy clause immunity, which basically says that a local prosecutor, a state prosecutor, cannot prosecute a federal agent for a criminal act.
[02:39:41.996 --> 02:39:44.979]  And we can understand the very serious consequences of that.
[02:39:45.620 --> 02:39:49.604]  And the consequences are... Even the Washington Post said how federal agents can kill someone and avoid prosecution.
[02:39:49.604 --> 02:39:50.045]  Right.
[02:39:50.045 --> 02:39:51.527]  So you've created... Longoriuchi.
[02:39:51.527 --> 02:39:51.867]  Right.
[02:39:51.867 --> 02:39:53.008]  You've created a system.
[02:39:53.008 --> 02:40:03.259]  The case they're relying on, one of them, is this terrible situation in Ruby Ridge from 1992, which many of your viewers will know very well, which Randy Weaver
[02:40:03.880 --> 02:40:05.701]  And he shot her with a baby in her arms and bragged about it.
[02:40:20.586 --> 02:40:21.066]  Right.
[02:40:21.066 --> 02:40:22.447]  Because he's a fruitcake.
[02:40:22.447 --> 02:40:23.848]  It was a horrendous moment.
[02:40:23.848 --> 02:40:35.756]  And so by extending it now to local law enforcement officials who can claim federal immunity, you've created a situation in which local government cannot prosecute police officers who can claim federal status.
[02:40:35.756 --> 02:40:41.880]  And it's the continuing federalization of law enforcement, something you, Alex, have talked about a lot.
[02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:43.141]  And the problem here is this.
[02:40:43.141 --> 02:40:46.483]  People would say, oh, well, you know, the federal government can prosecute these guys.
[02:40:46.883 --> 02:40:50.224]  Federal prosecutors do not prosecute state crimes in general.
[02:40:50.224 --> 02:40:52.364]  Federal prosecutors are focused more on federal crimes.
[02:40:52.364 --> 02:40:56.125]  So they're putting him into a phantom zone where the locals can't charge him and the feds can.
[02:40:56.125 --> 02:40:57.905]  This is 007 license to kill.
[02:40:57.905 --> 02:41:01.106]  A phantom zone is a great way to describe it.
[02:41:01.106 --> 02:41:07.068]  You could look at it also as a legal vacuum in which they're operating in this world in which the state can't prosecute them.
[02:41:07.068 --> 02:41:08.188]  It's a dead zone.
[02:41:08.188 --> 02:41:09.948]  The feds will not prosecute them.
[02:41:09.948 --> 02:41:13.409]  So you have a case here in which this guy is going to get away with manslaughter.
[02:41:13.789 --> 02:41:30.898]  And again, I'm not out to get cops in general because we've got bigger issues with corrupt government, but at the same time, this is what's causing all the anger that other people are politicizing and using to, again, the federal level, demonize the police, then federalize them, force cops to all go on task forces to then get immunity.
[02:41:30.898 --> 02:41:31.999]  You can see the takeover plan.
[02:41:32.279 --> 02:41:32.839]  Absolutely.
[02:41:32.839 --> 02:41:34.480]  I mean, the problem here is this.
[02:41:34.480 --> 02:41:43.804]  If you heard of this scenario in a, say, third-world country, in which the third-world country said, we don't prosecute police officers, people would be incensed.
[02:41:43.804 --> 02:41:45.505]  People would say, you can't do that.
[02:41:45.505 --> 02:41:49.567]  And then they would say, in America, we hold everyone to the same standard of the law.
[02:41:49.867 --> 02:41:53.608]  What this ruling shows, and what this immunity shows, is we don't.
[02:41:53.608 --> 02:41:53.869]  Sure.
[02:41:53.869 --> 02:42:03.792]  Why didn't the cop admit he probably pulled the gun out, it was hot and sweaty, he pulled the trigger, he thought he was a suspect, he killed him, he'd still get in trouble, but at least he told the truth.
[02:42:03.792 --> 02:42:09.194]  Instead, he just lies and says, you know, that it was, you know, he shot him from a distance and all this stuff, if I remember correctly.
[02:42:09.194 --> 02:42:09.955]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:42:09.955 --> 02:42:11.815]  And then now we learn he was right up behind him.
[02:42:11.815 --> 02:42:12.936]  I mean, this is scary.
[02:42:12.936 --> 02:42:16.237]  Who are these guys they're hiring that just execute people?
[02:42:16.357 --> 02:42:23.883]  Well, what he said in federal court was this was an unintentional shooting, and I know a lot of your viewers are well familiar with guns.
[02:42:23.883 --> 02:42:30.548]  Tell me, is it ever unintentional to put a finger on the trigger, put a gun to the back of someone's neck and pull the trigger?
[02:42:30.548 --> 02:42:32.690]  Is that intentional or unintentional?
[02:42:32.690 --> 02:42:34.351]  Well, it sounds like an execution to me.
[02:42:34.831 --> 02:42:39.814]  It obviously was intentional, and the forensic evidence is overwhelming on this point.
[02:42:39.814 --> 02:42:49.159]  And what's so upsetting, in a broader sense, is how are we going to allow this guy to escape criminal accountability and not even have a jury trial?
[02:42:49.159 --> 02:42:52.101]  That he simply gets off on a legal technicality from the 1800s.
[02:42:54.628 --> 02:42:59.370]  I tell you, you know, it's one thing if somebody pulls their wallet out and looks like a gun and a cop shoots him.
[02:42:59.370 --> 02:43:05.571]  I can, even though I don't like saying, you know, that they should be able to walk, I understand it's a tough job, people make mistakes.
[02:43:05.571 --> 02:43:09.173]  But on the other side of that, though, the guy didn't do anything.
[02:43:09.173 --> 02:43:11.353]  He comes to the bank, he's dressed nice, he's like, what's going on?
[02:43:11.353 --> 02:43:17.415]  The cop comes over, gets in his face, he gets scared, he runs, the cop thinks maybe he's a felon or something, I'll get him.
[02:43:17.415 --> 02:43:21.356]  I see that point tackling, but you don't just shoot him in the back of the head.
[02:43:21.356 --> 02:43:21.677]  Right.
[02:43:21.677 --> 02:43:23.057]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:43:23.438 --> 02:43:27.090]  And all these cases I've handled when it's come to excessive force cases.
[02:43:27.819 --> 02:43:31.020]  Every time in 10 years, there's always been a claim of self-defense.
[02:43:31.020 --> 02:43:33.381]  In this case, there's no claim of self-defense.
[02:43:33.381 --> 02:43:35.742]  Kleiner does not claim he was attacked.
[02:43:35.742 --> 02:43:37.843]  He does not claim he was defending himself.
[02:43:37.843 --> 02:43:42.065]  Again, he claims that the shooting was unintentional, that it was an accident.
[02:43:42.065 --> 02:43:43.266]  And it's complete nonsense.
[02:43:43.266 --> 02:43:46.567]  He was indicted for manslaughter by Travis County Grand Jury.
[02:43:46.567 --> 02:43:53.050]  And unfortunately, we're never going to get to trial unless the appellate court, and quite likely the Supreme Court, takes a look at this.
[02:43:53.510 --> 02:43:54.170]  And we'll see.
[02:43:54.170 --> 02:44:09.315]  I think the Supreme Court will take this case because it is such a hot-button issue now that I believe the justices are aware of how significant the issue of police brutality is and I think there needs to be a re-examination of the law to make sure this does not happen.
[02:44:09.315 --> 02:44:22.140]  Well, he's got to get in some trouble and then what I see is the George Soros crowd funding all this general anti-police rhetoric and people saying kill the cops and then cops pumping gaskets shot who aren't the bad cops.
[02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:31.207]  It's just both sides have just circled the wagons and it seems like a really bad collision course, but out of it is the federalization.
[02:44:31.207 --> 02:44:35.330]  In fact, can you guys queue up the Al Sharpton where he said, we're going to federalize all the police?
[02:44:35.330 --> 02:44:38.813]  Well, how are the feds, you know, going to fix all these problems?
[02:44:38.813 --> 02:44:39.953]  They're obviously not.
[02:44:39.953 --> 02:44:42.475]  A lot of their training has led to this.
[02:44:42.475 --> 02:44:44.457]  So we need a separation of powers.
[02:44:44.457 --> 02:44:48.080]  We need both federal and state as checks and balances in my view.
[02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:49.321]  Correct me if you disagree.
[02:44:49.821 --> 02:44:53.905]  Not just some federal mothership that decides everything.
[02:44:53.905 --> 02:45:04.715]  I think it's a fundamental issue of what should be a limit on federal government, meaning that if a police officer commits a crime in Texas, they should be prosecuted by the state of Texas.
[02:45:04.715 --> 02:45:10.221]  We shouldn't have to rely on the federal government to do it, because as you're well aware, they won't do it.
[02:45:12.691 --> 02:45:21.716]  Well, it's just like when the CIA will hire local county people or even Justice Department people so they have an excuse to operate domestically on their teams.
[02:45:21.716 --> 02:45:22.797]  It's still a conspiracy.
[02:45:22.797 --> 02:45:24.257]  It goes around the law.
[02:45:24.257 --> 02:45:28.800]  They follow the letter of it, but not the spirit.
[02:45:28.800 --> 02:45:32.322]  And for me, again, bigger than the police shooting innocent people, which is important.
[02:45:33.553 --> 02:45:49.109]  Just, this is, the feds bring pressure on local police, they use media to go after them in general, they take these cases, project it on the general police, then the answer is the feds come in with training, with federalization, to federalize the police, and then don't prosecute bad cops, and the problem even gets worse.
[02:45:49.369 --> 02:45:51.750]  Right, I think it's actually a question of legitimacy.
[02:45:51.750 --> 02:46:07.457]  If the citizens do not feel that the court system or the government is legitimate and will not hold jury trials for police officers that commit crimes, I think we are looking at a very serious issue as to how the citizens will view the government.
[02:46:07.937 --> 02:46:10.038]  And I think it's an issue that's of major concern.
[02:46:10.038 --> 02:46:10.998]  I agree with you.
[02:46:10.998 --> 02:46:15.400]  When you look at the incidents of police brutality, it's a very serious issue.
[02:46:15.400 --> 02:46:23.484]  But the bigger issue is the question of can we trust the government to bring government officials who commit crimes to justice?
[02:46:23.484 --> 02:46:33.808]  And I think that what this case shows is there are so many loopholes that protect government officials who commit crimes that there's a real question of legitimacy at this point.
[02:46:33.988 --> 02:46:35.969]  I agree, and what you're talking about is the new royalty.
[02:46:35.969 --> 02:46:44.093]  Royalty in all other cultures, Japanese, French, whatever, English, was above the law, and you couldn't prosecute them, and local law didn't apply.
[02:46:44.093 --> 02:46:52.077]  Magna Carta 1215 tried to stand up against that and say, no, the nobility of the king is not above the law, but what about regular cops on the beat?
[02:46:52.077 --> 02:46:54.878]  They can be prosecuted, but if you're on a federal task force, you can't?
[02:46:54.878 --> 02:46:56.379]  That's a new class system.
[02:46:56.619 --> 02:47:05.843]  Absolutely, and of all people, Chief Acevedo, who I know you know quite well, he was quoted as saying, there needs to be a consistent standard to this.
[02:47:05.843 --> 02:47:13.466]  There can't be a separate rule for federal agents, but yet state officers who can't make a federal claim can still be prosecuted.
[02:47:13.466 --> 02:47:14.427]  Well, what about disciplinary?
[02:47:14.427 --> 02:47:18.329]  Think of the belligerent-ness of cops that are on federal task forces in a department.
[02:47:18.329 --> 02:47:20.249]  I mean, who do they serve?
[02:47:20.249 --> 02:47:20.810]  It's not good.
[02:47:22.793 --> 02:47:26.015]  We have a clip of Sharpton right here saying we're going to federalize the police.
[02:47:26.015 --> 02:47:27.336]  This is what this is really about.
[02:47:27.336 --> 02:47:27.676]  Here it is.
[02:47:39.844 --> 02:47:41.865]  And that clip's got a glitch for some reason.
[02:47:41.865 --> 02:47:45.228]  We've got a full clip where he says we're going to federalize them all over the country out of this.
[02:47:45.228 --> 02:47:51.992]  We're going to try to work on that clip, come back from break, and play the entire clip of Sharpe as soon as the computer glitches every once in a while.
[02:47:51.992 --> 02:47:54.854]  We're going to go to break here in just a moment.
[02:47:54.854 --> 02:48:04.401]  It's loewyfirm.com, loewyfirm.com, and just in 30 seconds, let me ask you before we go to break,
[02:48:05.489 --> 02:48:06.369]  Do you ever get threatened?
[02:48:06.369 --> 02:48:10.791]  Do you ever get messed with for going after these bad cops?
[02:48:10.791 --> 02:48:11.371]  No.
[02:48:11.371 --> 02:48:12.231]  Not here in Austin.
[02:48:12.231 --> 02:48:16.352]  I think everyone understands there needs to be a process and a system.
[02:48:16.352 --> 02:48:22.194]  So I think in Austin especially, all the way from the chief on down, there's been an understanding.
[02:48:22.194 --> 02:48:24.155]  Well, I'm not kissing the Austin Police Department's butt.
[02:48:24.155 --> 02:48:25.235]  I've been to a lot of other cities.
[02:48:25.235 --> 02:48:26.916]  Let me tell you, I've been all over the world.
[02:48:26.916 --> 02:48:28.336]  We've got a really good police department.
[02:48:28.556 --> 02:48:29.577]  I totally agree.
[02:48:29.577 --> 02:48:34.921]  But still, what's scary is there's still a lot of problems here, but at least they're trying to do something about it.
[02:48:34.921 --> 02:48:36.583]  Look at other cities where nothing's done.
[02:48:36.583 --> 02:48:36.843]  Right.
[02:48:36.843 --> 02:48:50.334]  I've handled cases in other cities, most notably Chicago, and it is a totally different world there, in which there are some very bad elements in the police department and the government that do very bad things.
[02:48:50.954 --> 02:48:58.436]  Well, living in a city with a good police department versus the bad ones, it's just the difference between living in a third world country and living in America.
[02:48:58.436 --> 02:48:59.656]  And that's what we're fighting for.
[02:48:59.656 --> 02:49:05.018]  We're going to go to break and come back with our guest on the other side of this break.
[02:49:05.018 --> 02:49:07.418]  Adam Lowy is our guest constitutional lawyer.
[02:49:07.418 --> 02:49:08.659]  He's been winning a lot of his cases.
[02:49:08.659 --> 02:49:11.079]  This one they just took the ball away from him completely.
[02:49:11.079 --> 02:49:13.360]  We're going to talk about solutions when we come back from break.
[02:49:14.963 --> 02:49:20.687]  We've got a bunch of specials ending today, and it's your purchases of the high-quality products that fund our operation.

[02:49:49.399 --> 02:49:50.420]  That all ends.

[02:49:57.246 --> 02:50:00.248]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[02:50:02.489 --> 02:50:03.669]  We have other specials.

[02:50:21.016 --> 02:50:24.897]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:50:24.897 --> 02:50:26.277]  That special ends.
[02:50:26.277 --> 02:50:27.478]  You know, we have a fourth hour now.
[02:50:28.098 --> 02:50:32.801]  So I will extend it to the end of the fourth hour, but within one hour and 10 minutes, the special is gone.
[02:50:32.801 --> 02:50:35.743]  25% off on that as well.
[02:50:35.743 --> 02:50:43.268]  And free shipping, that's free shipping on the InfoWars Select high quality storable foods and 10% off.
[02:50:43.268 --> 02:50:49.212]  That does end in one hour, 10 minutes, and it will be taken off the shopping cart InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:50:49.212 --> 02:50:51.293]  And I want to thank you all for spreading the word about the broadcast.

[02:51:07.453 --> 02:51:13.014]  According to the EPA, indoor air can be 5 to 100 times worse than outdoor air.
[02:51:13.014 --> 02:51:19.775]  And the American Lung Association states that poor indoor air can cause infections and chronic lung diseases such as asthma.

[02:52:30.989 --> 02:52:32.749]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[02:52:32.749 --> 02:52:34.710]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?

[02:52:52.675 --> 02:52:52.855]  That's 877-886-3653.
[02:52:57.896 --> 02:53:01.218]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[02:53:01.218 --> 02:53:06.701]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[02:53:06.701 --> 02:53:08.983]  But they're about to lose control.
[02:53:08.983 --> 02:53:13.926]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[02:53:14.286 --> 02:53:18.869]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[02:53:18.869 --> 02:53:21.270]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[02:53:21.270 --> 02:53:25.112]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[02:53:25.112 --> 02:53:29.635]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[02:53:29.635 --> 02:53:32.757]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[02:53:32.757 --> 02:53:35.338]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[02:53:35.338 --> 02:53:36.699]  This will affect us all.
[02:53:37.199 --> 02:53:41.923]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[02:53:41.923 --> 02:53:48.329]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.
[02:53:48.329 --> 02:53:54.434]  You can watch the video for free right now by going to DollarDanger.com.
[02:53:54.434 --> 02:53:56.416]  Again, that's DollarDanger.com.
[02:54:18.957 --> 02:54:24.578]  Adam Loewy's with us five minutes to the next hour, then David Knight takes over quarterbacking the fourth hour.
[02:54:24.578 --> 02:54:42.043]  Adam, I'm going to try to shut up and just have you in this segment the next, break down where this case is going, where other cases is going, and what you think average people can do to try to stop the militarization of police, the us-against-them culture, but also the federalization.
[02:54:42.711 --> 02:54:51.454]  Well, the first thing is, is that when you look at the criminal process, the District Attorney of Travis County has indicated she will appeal it, which is the correct decision.
[02:54:51.454 --> 02:54:58.096]  The Fifth Circuit is going to review it, and that is the decision to grant Kleiner criminal immunity under the Supremacy Clause.
[02:54:58.476 --> 02:55:02.319]  And I believe this is a case that will go to the United States Supreme Court.
[02:55:02.319 --> 02:55:12.386]  It is that hot button of an issue and it needs to be evaluated by the Supreme Court because these officers are able to get off without prosecution from cases literally from the 1800s.
[02:55:12.386 --> 02:55:16.229]  And the truth is that we have moved forward as a nation.
[02:55:16.229 --> 02:55:17.790]  The law needs to catch up.
[02:55:17.790 --> 02:55:20.712]  In regards to the civil case, the city council settled.
[02:55:21.232 --> 02:55:24.633]  One half of the civil case for Larry's children for over a million dollars.
[02:55:24.633 --> 02:55:27.713]  We continue to negotiate for Larry's mother and Larry's wife.
[02:55:27.713 --> 02:55:29.974]  We're confident we will resolve that.
[02:55:29.974 --> 02:55:32.094]  But the civil case is a small part of all of this.
[02:55:32.094 --> 02:55:42.837]  The biggest issue is the criminal prosecution and where we go as a country if we're going to allow a situation in which federal officers are immune from prosecution.
[02:55:42.837 --> 02:55:44.757]  I believe that is very, very dangerous.
[02:55:46.127 --> 02:55:56.411]  I know it scares me because I think about the feds at Waco and Ruby Ridge and their drone operations killing everybody, and then they get up there on the news like they're these little loving sweeties that care about everybody's rights.
[02:55:56.411 --> 02:56:01.612]  I mean, I had family that worked in clandestine operations that people don't even know exist.
[02:56:01.612 --> 02:56:07.174]  And let me tell you, they told me, without giving me any classified info, they just said, it's worse than you can imagine.
[02:56:07.174 --> 02:56:11.676]  So people need to understand, the folks running our federal government are not the angels they think they are.
[02:56:12.361 --> 02:56:20.926]  One of the big issues, I think, when it comes to government issues, and most people don't realize this, but it is basically impossible to sue the government.
[02:56:20.926 --> 02:56:30.731]  The government makes the laws, they make it nearly impossible for citizens to sue the government, and when a citizen sues the government, there's all these legal hurdles they have to jump through.
[02:56:30.731 --> 02:56:35.313]  Qualified immunity, supremacy clause immunity, a number of legal roadblocks.
[02:56:35.373 --> 02:56:38.554]  That is something that when people talk about government, they don't talk about that.
[02:56:38.554 --> 02:56:39.134]  Sure.
[02:56:39.134 --> 02:56:46.376]  They make it very hard because the government and people in the government do not want to be held responsible or accountable for anything they do.
[02:56:46.376 --> 02:56:55.518]  And we've seen that from everything from this case to say a Michael Morton case in which it was the man in Williamson County that was wrongfully convicted of killing his wife.
[02:56:55.518 --> 02:56:56.558]  And they knew it turned out.
[02:56:56.558 --> 02:56:57.218]  They knew it.
[02:56:57.218 --> 02:56:58.358]  They knew he was innocent.
[02:56:58.358 --> 02:56:59.879]  Why did they do that to a nice guy?
[02:56:59.879 --> 02:57:00.819]  He didn't have a criminal record.
[02:57:00.899 --> 02:57:09.241]  Right, they knew it, and so what I think happens in these cases is you have certain people in government, not all of them, but certain people that are drunk on power, literally.
[02:57:09.241 --> 02:57:17.304]  And they want to wield power, and they want to prove- Sure, why would you know there's a bandana of a known killer, but instead you want to put the innocent, good-looking dad in?
[02:57:17.304 --> 02:57:19.044]  Is it because you'll get more press?
[02:57:19.044 --> 02:57:20.445]  Because he looks like Mr. America?
[02:57:20.445 --> 02:57:23.125]  Do you cold-bloodedly go, I burned this nice father?
[02:57:23.125 --> 02:57:24.726]  Obviously the prosecutor's been indicted and others.
[02:57:25.686 --> 02:57:30.850]  I mean, how do you get so sick to know a dad's innocent and then still want to burn him when you know who did it?
[02:57:55.506 --> 02:57:56.807]  Yeah, they later found out, did it.
[02:57:56.807 --> 02:57:57.227]  Right.
[02:57:57.227 --> 02:57:59.849]  And they do it because they do not want to admit they are wrong.
[02:57:59.849 --> 02:58:00.930]  That's the fundamental thing.
[02:58:00.930 --> 02:58:01.590]  They want to believe.
[02:58:01.590 --> 02:58:04.292]  And if they would have admitted it and let him out, they wouldn't have gotten in trouble.
[02:58:04.292 --> 02:58:08.515]  But it was their not even wanting to have a blemish on them that's going to put them in prison.
[02:58:08.515 --> 02:58:09.016]  Right.
[02:58:09.016 --> 02:58:18.663]  And so I've seen this up close in police brutality cases, and it's a very scary thing to observe of certain people in government that simply feel they can do whatever they want.
[02:58:18.663 --> 02:58:20.284]  It's just crazy, though.
[02:58:20.284 --> 02:58:24.387]  I just could not imagine knowing someone's innocent and wanting to put them in prison.
[02:58:24.987 --> 02:58:26.247]  It's disgusting.
[02:58:26.247 --> 02:58:32.809]  I have no idea how these people sleep at night and I'm very happy in the Michael Morton case there at least was some justice done there.
[02:58:32.809 --> 02:58:34.690]  The man lost 25 years of his life.
[02:58:34.690 --> 02:58:35.650]  We're back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:35.650 --> 02:58:39.791]  I want to ask you where you think all this is going and again more of what we can do to turn it around.

[02:59:45.214 --> 02:59:47.595]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:59.727 --> 03:00:05.149]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:05.149 --> 03:00:07.350]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:00:25.099 --> 03:00:28.800]  Adam Lowy, constitutional lawyer here in Central Texas, is our guest.
[03:00:28.800 --> 03:00:32.181]  He joins us.
[03:00:32.181 --> 03:00:36.301]  How is the family in this case handling it to see their father?
[03:00:36.301 --> 03:00:39.482]  People say, oh, a million dollars paid out.
[03:00:39.482 --> 03:00:44.643]  Well, I mean, a million dollars over the next 20 years is nothing for these kids.
[03:00:44.643 --> 03:00:46.603]  I'll guarantee you they'd rather have their father.
[03:00:46.603 --> 03:00:49.104]  But it is a taxpayer issue.
[03:00:49.104 --> 03:00:53.565]  What about all these huge sums have to be paid out as part of these
[03:00:55.216 --> 03:00:56.697]  These things the police are doing?
[03:00:56.697 --> 03:01:00.399]  Well, I think it's an issue of there needs to be some sort of accountability.
[03:01:00.399 --> 03:01:06.102]  And what we're seeing is people will say out there, well, why don't you just prosecute these police officers if they do something wrong?
[03:01:06.102 --> 03:01:08.163]  Well, we're witnessing that's basically impossible.
[03:01:08.163 --> 03:01:12.606]  You can't prosecute these officers because they have so many ways to get off.
[03:01:12.606 --> 03:01:18.850]  So I think civil settlements are a recognition by the government that something went wrong and that the family's compensated.
[03:01:18.850 --> 03:01:22.592]  But I can tell you in this case, especially Larry's mother and father,
[03:01:23.052 --> 03:01:25.713]  I mean, it goes way beyond any sort of settlement.
[03:01:25.713 --> 03:01:35.978]  They wanted to see this officer go before a jury of his peers and have them pass judgment on whether he committed a felony act when he killed Larry.
[03:01:35.978 --> 03:01:38.240]  And now we're not going to be able to see that.
[03:01:38.240 --> 03:01:39.720]  And it's very upsetting.
[03:01:39.720 --> 03:01:43.562]  The family is extremely upset, as anyone would be in their position.
[03:01:43.562 --> 03:01:45.083]  But that's what we're dealing with right now.
[03:01:45.083 --> 03:01:48.825]  We'll see what happens in the appellate court and then possibly in the Supreme Court.
[03:01:48.825 --> 03:01:50.586]  But, you know, it's going to be three years from now.
[03:01:51.488 --> 03:01:56.414]  It's already been two and a half years since this happened, and that's another strategy that the government uses.
[03:01:56.414 --> 03:01:57.715]  They delay everything.
[03:01:57.715 --> 03:01:59.958]  There's just constant delays.
[03:01:59.958 --> 03:02:02.000]  Again, the shooting was two and a half years ago.
[03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:06.205]  Have you ever had a chance to talk to this particular Officer Kleiner?
[03:02:06.205 --> 03:02:10.490]  Have you ever had a chance to sit down in all these court proceedings and depose him?
[03:02:10.490 --> 03:02:12.012]  Does he have any remorse about this?
[03:02:12.412 --> 03:02:17.434]  Well, we have not yet had the chance to depose him in the civil case, but we will now.
[03:02:17.434 --> 03:02:21.695]  But I saw him testify in the criminal case and he was getting choked up.
[03:02:21.695 --> 03:02:26.416]  I think this is not something he planned to do when he woke up that day.
[03:02:26.416 --> 03:02:31.098]  But at the end of the day, I think he got into a state of rage and he murdered this guy.
[03:02:31.098 --> 03:02:35.559]  And I think that the truth is, is that some would say, well, he's a police officer.
[03:02:35.559 --> 03:02:36.879]  Mistakes are going to get made.
[03:02:36.879 --> 03:02:38.500]  We have to protect these police officers.
[03:02:38.840 --> 03:02:46.425]  But I feel that's a fundamental issue of the government, the social contract with the citizens, that there must be limits on government power.
[03:02:46.425 --> 03:02:51.969]  Sure, and let's be clear, you sign up to be a cop, you know it's a really rough job, and people are going to give you some leeway.
[03:02:51.969 --> 03:02:57.313]  My issue is, if they don't clean it up, it's going to give the globalists an excuse to come in and federalize them.
[03:02:57.313 --> 03:02:59.235]  That's clearly what's happening here.
[03:02:59.235 --> 03:03:02.217]  So, that's, I mean, your point about the federalization is just sensational.
[03:03:02.972 --> 03:03:30.828]  I think it's very worrisome, and I think what you're going to see is you're going to see more of, say, the Black Lives Matter movement, of which most of those people in the movement, I believe, are very good folks, but of course there are certain elements in that movement that are extreme, and I think what you'll see is the continued marginalization of movements like this, and there will be continued issues to ignore the problem and create things where the government distracts people from dealing with these issues.
[03:03:30.948 --> 03:03:33.149]  Sure, it's going to use it to get more power.
[03:03:33.149 --> 03:03:33.950]  The bad forces are.
[03:03:33.950 --> 03:03:36.371]  Look at this newest article on Infowars.com.
[03:03:36.371 --> 03:03:42.974]  FUFU racist, pro-Clinton PAC uses foul-mouthed Hispanic children to attack Trump.
[03:03:42.974 --> 03:03:47.157]  PAC bribes activists to disrupt Trump's Saturday night live appearance.
[03:03:48.337 --> 03:03:50.678]  This is some dirty politics that are going on.
[03:03:50.678 --> 03:03:54.140]  It's all racially based, and it's very, very dangerous.
[03:03:54.140 --> 03:03:55.981]  It needs to be de-escalated.
[03:03:55.981 --> 03:04:06.766]  I think we're at a critical point in American political history with the rise of Trump in the sense that when you look at him, I don't believe he's a legitimate candidate, but the truth is that he's very popular.
[03:04:06.766 --> 03:04:09.287]  And I think the reason why is a lot of people that support him
[03:04:09.927 --> 03:04:18.273]  Firmly believe the system is rigged, and he offers a different option than the two-party manufactured candidate.
[03:04:18.273 --> 03:04:28.161]  I think it's going to be very interesting to see how this thing plays out down the road, because I think you are finally seeing people that are just fed up with the system, and that explains the rise of Trump.
[03:04:28.681 --> 03:04:31.382]  Well, well, Adam Loewy, loewyfirm.com.
[03:04:31.382 --> 03:04:32.483]  Always good to have you in.
[03:04:32.483 --> 03:04:34.484]  Please come in any time.
[03:04:34.484 --> 03:04:35.504]  I've seen you downtown.
[03:04:35.504 --> 03:04:37.305]  We ought to go out and get dinner sometime.
[03:04:37.305 --> 03:04:40.847]  But I really appreciate you letting the folks pick your brain here.
[03:04:40.847 --> 03:04:45.269]  Coming up, David Knight has got a bunch of the breaking news and info we haven't covered yet.
[03:04:45.269 --> 03:04:46.909]  Coming up... Thanks a lot, buddy.
[03:04:46.909 --> 03:04:47.630]  Thanks, bud.
[03:04:47.630 --> 03:04:48.730]  And good luck with your case.
[03:04:48.730 --> 03:04:52.812]  It's just a tragedy for everybody, but we can't let these people be above the law.
[03:04:52.812 --> 03:04:53.693]  Nobody is.
[03:04:53.693 --> 03:04:54.413]  Stay with us, folks.
[03:04:59.139 --> 03:05:17.375]  Two more whistleblowers were arrested by the Vatican today as two books being released this week allege the Vatican Bank is involved in money laundering, insider trading, market manipulation, offering sainthood for sale, and taking funds collected for a children's hospital and using them to remodel a mega penthouse.
[03:05:18.255 --> 03:05:24.336]  All this, while Pope Francis lectures us on his vision of a, quote, poor church, unquote.
[03:05:24.336 --> 03:05:32.018]  At best, the Vatican bank scandal is a tale of a pope who pushes global governance while he can't even manage his own small government.
[03:05:32.018 --> 03:05:36.479]  But at worst, it's the tip of an iceberg of greed and corruption.
[03:05:36.479 --> 03:05:40.440]  The pope tells us we need global governance and wealth distribution because of greed.
[03:05:41.184 --> 03:05:44.087]  But he doesn't tell us whose greed.
[03:05:44.087 --> 03:05:51.475]  Maybe we need to be concerned about his greed and the greed of the multinational elite who are pushing the global agenda with him.
[03:05:51.475 --> 03:05:53.537]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.

[03:07:55.899 --> 03:08:05.322]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:05.322 --> 03:08:07.623]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:11.129 --> 03:08:12.450]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:12.450 --> 03:08:17.053]  I'm David Knight, your host on this fourth hour, November 4th, 2015.
[03:08:17.053 --> 03:08:18.534]  Rob Duhl will be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[03:08:18.534 --> 03:08:21.556]  We're going to talk about some of the election results.
[03:08:21.556 --> 03:08:24.418]  Some communities have removed fluoride from the water.
[03:08:24.418 --> 03:08:25.539]  Imagine that!
[03:08:25.539 --> 03:08:31.443]  But then, of course, there's some hidden carcinogens that are being put into the water and it's placed in other places.
[03:08:31.443 --> 03:08:35.006]  So Rob's going to break down some of those results, break down some of
[03:08:35.626 --> 03:08:38.868]  What is in the water still in many areas.
[03:08:38.868 --> 03:08:59.202]  I thought it was very interesting to see today this article from Hillary Clinton that's at the top of the Drudge Report that Hillary is stepping up her smear campaign against Bernie and using the traditional weapons of political correctness, calling him essentially a sexist and now implying that he is racist.
[03:08:59.202 --> 03:08:59.383]  Yeah.
[03:09:00.244 --> 03:09:03.953]  Maybe this is where they jump the shark with political correctness.
[03:09:03.953 --> 03:09:05.858]  You know, this has been the McCarthyism of the left.
[03:09:06.907 --> 03:09:18.331]  And maybe now that people on the left are seeing how this is being misused against one of their own unjustly, maybe now they'll waken up and do something about it.
[03:09:18.331 --> 03:09:35.836]  This is, to just remind you of what happened back on October 23rd, Clinton took a phrase that Sanders has routinely used in talking about gun violence that, quote, shouting wouldn't solve the problem, suggested that he had aimed it at her because, you know, when women talk, some people think we're shouting.
[03:09:36.616 --> 03:09:49.785]  See, that's the chip-on-the-shoulder, victim attitude, trying to make yourself look like a victim, trying to make somebody else look like a bully, like a sexist, like a racist, and now this is what she's added.
[03:09:49.785 --> 03:09:53.667]  She says, there are some who say that gun violence is an urban problem.
[03:09:53.667 --> 03:09:57.190]  Sometimes what they mean by this is a black problem.
[03:09:57.190 --> 03:10:00.232]  No, actually, we mean what we say.
[03:10:00.232 --> 03:10:04.675]  That's the other favorite tactic of these people, is to put words into your mouth.
[03:10:04.675 --> 03:10:06.016]  So, you know, first she interprets
[03:10:06.696 --> 03:10:08.618]  The fact that people are shouting about that.
[03:10:08.618 --> 03:10:10.719]  Oh, you must mean me because I'm a woman.
[03:10:10.719 --> 03:10:13.101]  And then when he says, well, it's an urban problem.
[03:10:13.101 --> 03:10:14.482]  Maybe he said that.
[03:10:14.482 --> 03:10:15.322]  Maybe he didn't.
[03:10:15.322 --> 03:10:15.863]  I don't know.
[03:10:15.863 --> 03:10:18.605]  Nevertheless, she says, but it's not an urban problem.
[03:10:18.605 --> 03:10:19.866]  It's not black.
[03:10:19.866 --> 03:10:21.066]  It's not urban.
[03:10:21.066 --> 03:10:25.570]  It's a deep, profound challenge to who we are.
[03:10:25.570 --> 03:10:27.031]  So here you go.
[03:10:27.031 --> 03:10:30.994]  Hillary Clinton coming after Bernie Sanders, of all people.
[03:10:30.994 --> 03:10:32.014]  You know, here's this guy.
[03:10:33.436 --> 03:10:42.188]  I guess she's trying to get to the left of Bernie using political correctness because, you know, that's the ultimate leftist tactic.
[03:10:42.188 --> 03:10:44.071]  But I think that she's going to jump the shark.
[03:10:44.071 --> 03:10:48.417]  And I think the other part of this, the other good thing that's going to come out of this presidential campaign
[03:10:49.821 --> 03:10:57.027]  Is the fact that Donald Trump is tackling this head-on and pointing out how stupid it is.
[03:10:57.027 --> 03:11:06.254]  Not apologizing about political correctness charges and every time he gets in their face about it, his poll numbers shoot straight up.
[03:11:06.254 --> 03:11:13.340]  So yeah, when they come after him for Saturday Night Live and we got an article at the top of Infowars.com about how they're paying people to troll him.
[03:11:14.120 --> 03:11:15.842]  At the Saturday Night Live performance.
[03:11:15.842 --> 03:11:19.465]  Yeah, you know, when they do that, that's only going to help Trump.
[03:11:19.465 --> 03:11:20.666]  So keep on.
[03:11:20.666 --> 03:11:21.587]  Go ahead with that.
[03:11:21.587 --> 03:11:26.712]  Because what we're really seeing here, whether Trump wins or not, and I'm not a big fan of Trump.
[03:11:26.712 --> 03:11:28.854]  I think he's got some good ideas on some issues.
[03:11:28.854 --> 03:11:33.518]  Of course, the issue is, do you really trust any of these people to follow through on what they're telling you?
[03:11:33.518 --> 03:11:34.759]  They run focus groups.
[03:11:34.759 --> 03:11:37.062]  They run very detailed analysis.
[03:11:37.062 --> 03:11:39.424]  So what we might talk about later if we've got time.
[03:11:40.004 --> 03:11:48.493]  An article talking about neuropolitics and how they are really making this into the kind of science that they've used for marketing to us.
[03:11:48.493 --> 03:11:51.495]  And of course, he's been a very successful marketer.
[03:11:51.495 --> 03:11:55.459]  So don't you think that he and the rest of them know exactly what you want to hear?
[03:11:55.459 --> 03:11:55.860]  There you go.
[03:11:55.860 --> 03:11:57.441]  Neuropolitics.
[03:11:57.441 --> 03:11:59.844]  When campaigns try to read your mind.
[03:11:59.844 --> 03:12:01.305]  Yeah, they're going to read your mind.
[03:12:01.305 --> 03:12:03.707]  They're going to tell you exactly what you want to hear.
[03:12:03.707 --> 03:12:04.088]  But look.
[03:12:05.208 --> 03:12:14.162]  One good thing is, is that he knows and the rest of us know now that we are tired of being beaten over the head with this political correctness nonsense.
[03:12:14.162 --> 03:12:18.168]  Now I want to take a look too at China because Alex talked about this a lot earlier in the show.
[03:12:19.204 --> 03:12:36.017]  The one-child policy of China, how that's not sustainable, and about the fact that China is the best example of globalist government, with the Rockefellers setting up, with Henry Kissinger bringing them online, and the way they have treated their citizens.
[03:12:36.017 --> 03:12:46.986]  They're a great example of the kind of tyranny we're going to see from a one-world government, because they've essentially been put in place by a ruling corporate oligarchy, and we can see how they operate.
[03:12:47.586 --> 03:12:56.293]  But we're told over and over again that we have to have CISA, we have to have all this cyber security protection because of threats from China.
[03:12:56.293 --> 03:12:59.776]  Okay, yeah, they're doing espionage, so is everybody else.
[03:12:59.776 --> 03:13:08.943]  We're also told we've got to pass this secret Trans-Pacific Partnership as a protection against the Chinese trade dominance.
[03:13:09.824 --> 03:13:20.270]  And yet, as Senator Sessions has pointed out, once this is passed, once TPP has passed, there is a transnational committee that can change all the aspects of it.
[03:13:20.270 --> 03:13:28.655]  They can change every one of the details, which of course, we are now more than four weeks past the point at which they have concluded this and they still won't show it to us.
[03:13:28.655 --> 03:13:32.657]  They're waiting for a holiday reveal, I imagine, when people aren't paying any attention.
[03:13:33.550 --> 03:13:36.475]  But they're telling us that they have to do this to keep China out.
[03:13:36.475 --> 03:13:44.669]  They can not only change all the terms of the agreement, but they can bring into the agreement anyone that they wish after it is passed.
[03:13:44.669 --> 03:13:46.111]  But when we go back and look at the
[03:13:47.239 --> 03:13:55.690]  Narrative about surveillance, about corporate espionage, about military espionage, and getting military secrets.
[03:13:55.690 --> 03:13:59.335]  Look at this article from the New York Times that came out the end of last week.
[03:13:59.335 --> 03:13:59.616]  U.S.
[03:13:59.616 --> 03:14:03.921]  tech giants may blur national security boundaries in their deals with China.
[03:14:03.921 --> 03:14:04.502]  And they point out
[03:14:05.143 --> 03:14:13.226]  That one Chinese technology company receives crucial technical guidance from a former People's Liberation Army Rear Admiral.
[03:14:13.226 --> 03:14:16.828]  Another one developed the electronics on China's first atomic bomb.
[03:14:16.828 --> 03:14:21.009]  A third one sells technology to China's air-to-air missile research academy.
[03:14:21.009 --> 03:14:22.090]  But these guys...
[03:14:22.850 --> 03:14:29.674]  ...have deep ties through these companies to American companies like IBM, Cisco, and Microsoft.
[03:14:29.674 --> 03:14:30.554]  They're their partners.
[03:14:30.554 --> 03:14:40.460]  And so they say these cross-border partnerships with American technology companies, they share, they license, they jointly develop advanced technology with Chinese counterparts.
[03:14:41.300 --> 03:14:47.143]  Then of course, all this technology is being turned over to the Chinese government and other Chinese corporations.
[03:14:47.143 --> 03:14:49.105]  That's part of the China price.
[03:14:49.105 --> 03:14:58.630]  When people looked at China's competitiveness in trade and how they were killing everybody on trade, there's many elements of what they call the China price.
[03:14:58.630 --> 03:14:59.531]  One of those elements.
[03:15:00.410 --> 03:15:06.172]  is stealing technology, is ignoring trademarks, is making counterfeit technology.
[03:15:06.172 --> 03:15:07.933]  That is what they have mastered there.
[03:15:07.933 --> 03:15:26.399]  So when you talk about high-tech defense contractors making alliances with companies that are being run by Chinese military or former military, of course they're transferring technology, but we're supposed to sacrifice everything in this country, all of our privacy, all of our money to the national security state.
[03:15:27.159 --> 03:15:28.781]  For cyber security.
[03:15:28.781 --> 03:15:30.782]  That's precisely the problem.
[03:15:30.782 --> 03:15:36.888]  And then I want to take a look at this other story that comes from the Chinese radio network.
[03:15:36.888 --> 03:15:39.730]  This secret radio network.
[03:15:39.730 --> 03:15:43.894]  This was exposed by Reuters towards the end of last week.
[03:15:43.894 --> 03:15:46.356]  Picked up by multiple news outlets.
[03:15:46.356 --> 03:15:52.541]  Beijing's covert radio network airs China-friendly news across Washington and the rest of the world.
[03:15:53.422 --> 03:16:01.845]  Now of course we have Voice of America, we have Radio for Europe, we have Radio Marty, we have all these different propaganda outlets, and of course the Chinese do the same thing.
[03:16:01.845 --> 03:16:08.587]  It's just like we have the NSA spying on everybody, they've got their spy organizations, it's all this spy versus spy, but...
[03:16:09.167 --> 03:16:20.530]  We're supposed to get very concerned about this and the Department of Justice as well as the FCC is moving to shut down some of these radio stations because they have laws against foreign ownership.
[03:16:20.530 --> 03:16:25.791]  They say the foreign ownership has been hidden and so forth and so on.
[03:16:25.791 --> 03:16:29.012]  Why can't we have an open free competition?
[03:16:29.012 --> 03:16:31.353]  People can get all this information on the Internet.
[03:16:31.353 --> 03:16:34.774]  Oh, and that's one of the reasons why the FCC is trying to crack down on the Internet, isn't it?
[03:16:35.606 --> 03:16:40.272]  They're talking about a global web of 33 stations that everybody is very concerned about.
[03:16:40.272 --> 03:16:40.693]  You know what?
[03:16:40.693 --> 03:16:46.440]  I want to talk to you about a global web of a thousand schools.
[03:16:46.440 --> 03:16:47.101]  More than 120 of them in America.
[03:16:49.468 --> 03:16:53.292]  And they are propagandizing your children on a daily basis.
[03:16:53.292 --> 03:16:56.795]  It's far more than you would ever get out of a radio station.
[03:16:56.795 --> 03:16:58.036]  You can change the radio station.
[03:16:58.036 --> 03:16:59.437]  You may not listen to it that much.
[03:16:59.437 --> 03:17:07.565]  You're probably... Nobody's going to listen to a radio station as much as their children listen to teachers for the entire working day.
[03:17:07.565 --> 03:17:10.227]  You know, eight to ten hours they're in these schools.
[03:17:10.227 --> 03:17:11.688]  That's where they're going to be
[03:17:12.869 --> 03:17:14.870]  That's what education is about.
[03:17:14.870 --> 03:17:16.730]  That was the purpose of schools.
[03:17:16.730 --> 03:17:19.910]  Governments know that's the way they can shape the culture.
[03:17:19.910 --> 03:17:22.691]  They can engineer socially the children.
[03:17:22.691 --> 03:17:23.991]  Get them at an early age.
[03:17:23.991 --> 03:17:26.972]  Keep them as long as they can.
[03:17:26.972 --> 03:17:27.972]  Give them free college.
[03:17:27.972 --> 03:17:32.033]  Keep them in through the graduate level so they can continue to mold them.
[03:17:32.033 --> 03:17:37.074]  Get them in debt so they have to go to work for the government or they'll be in debt for the rest of their lives.
[03:17:37.734 --> 03:17:51.946]  But when we look at the 33 stations here that are covertly owned by China, and so they're giving information out that is friendly to China, in particular about this conflict that happened in the South China Sea last week.
[03:17:51.946 --> 03:18:01.473]  Wouldn't you be interested if there was a network of 120 American charter schools being run by one secretive imam?
[03:18:01.473 --> 03:18:03.074]  A guy who was thrown out of Turkey.
[03:18:04.128 --> 03:18:05.509]  In 1999.
[03:18:05.509 --> 03:18:10.072]  Because he was trying to set up a caliphate.
[03:18:10.072 --> 03:18:11.914]  An Islamic State, as he called it.
[03:18:11.914 --> 03:18:12.714]  Does that sound familiar?
[03:18:12.714 --> 03:18:14.095]  IS?
[03:18:14.095 --> 03:18:15.456]  As in ISIS?
[03:18:15.456 --> 03:18:18.138]  Well now they're here in America, and I went to a documentary.
[03:18:18.138 --> 03:18:23.462]  We're going to have the documentary filmmaker join us next week for an interview.
[03:18:23.462 --> 03:18:30.107]  Mark Hall, he did a movie called Killing Ed, and they were looking at charter schools, and they took as the worst case example
[03:18:30.787 --> 03:18:34.068]  Let me read you just a little bit of an Atlantic story that came out
[03:18:57.837 --> 03:19:06.820]  In August of 2014, they were looking at this, and again, they were looking at charter schools in general, but these Gulen schools in particular.
[03:19:06.820 --> 03:19:14.803]  They say Fethullah Gulen is not known for his openness, despite the size of his organization, which is rumored to have between 1 and 8 million adherents.
[03:19:14.803 --> 03:19:16.623]  Still very secretive, right?
[03:19:16.623 --> 03:19:24.806]  Known informally in Turkey as Hizmet, or The Service, they say Gulen schools enroll an estimated 2 million students around the globe.
[03:19:25.677 --> 03:19:34.203]  Now, in Texas, for example, there's 33 schools, and they're getting close to $100 million a year.
[03:19:34.203 --> 03:19:36.965]  This is a guy in Islamic countries.
[03:19:36.965 --> 03:19:39.567]  They openly operate as madrasas.
[03:19:39.567 --> 03:19:44.130]  There's accusations and allegations that here in America, they're doing the same thing.
[03:19:44.130 --> 03:19:46.172]  They're heavily pro-Islamic.
[03:19:46.172 --> 03:19:47.753]  They're heavily pro-Turkey.
[03:19:47.753 --> 03:19:51.376]  But we're supposed to get concerned and shut down radio stations, and maybe we should.
[03:19:51.376 --> 03:19:52.937]  But we should be even more concerned.
[03:19:53.477 --> 03:19:59.880]  About the Golan movement of schools and how they're trying to create ISIS here in America with the CIA.
[03:19:59.880 --> 03:20:03.181]  Do you worry about the health and safety of you and your loved ones?
[03:20:03.181 --> 03:20:07.263]  Do you wonder what would happen if you weren't able to get to a hospital or doctor?
[03:20:07.263 --> 03:20:12.325]  How can you keep your family safe against the deadly pathogens that are beginning to emerge in the world today?
[03:20:12.705 --> 03:20:16.287]  Give yourself peace of mind with Supernatural Silver.
[03:20:16.287 --> 03:20:23.811]  Supernatural Silver is turning heads around the world as a new weapon in the fight against bacteria, viruses, and fungus.

[03:22:42.801 --> 03:22:46.843]  Call 1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:22:46.843 --> 03:22:48.144]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:22:48.144 --> 03:22:49.985]  Say goodbye to the cable guy.
[03:22:49.985 --> 03:22:51.545]  Cut costs and get more.
[03:22:51.545 --> 03:22:52.106]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:22:52.106 --> 03:22:52.326]  1-855-905-MY-TV.
[03:23:00.560 --> 03:23:05.201]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[03:23:05.201 --> 03:23:09.482]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[03:23:09.482 --> 03:23:10.862]  We typically do the same thing.
[03:23:10.862 --> 03:23:13.882]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[03:23:13.882 --> 03:23:16.103]  But have you considered heat storage?
[03:23:16.103 --> 03:23:18.303]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[03:23:18.303 --> 03:23:20.583]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[03:23:20.583 --> 03:23:22.244]  How will I keep my family warm?
[03:23:22.244 --> 03:23:24.724]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[03:23:24.724 --> 03:23:28.785]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[03:23:29.605 --> 03:23:30.725]  Another concern?
[03:23:30.725 --> 03:23:34.706]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[03:23:34.706 --> 03:23:37.287]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[03:23:37.287 --> 03:23:41.268]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[03:23:41.268 --> 03:23:44.069]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[03:23:44.069 --> 03:23:48.710]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[03:23:48.710 --> 03:23:50.730]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[03:23:50.730 --> 03:23:52.371]  FortressClothing.com.
[03:23:52.371 --> 03:23:53.711]  You'll never be cold again.
[03:24:08.115 --> 03:24:10.076]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:10.076 --> 03:24:11.076]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[03:24:11.076 --> 03:24:13.397]  I want to get to politics.
[03:24:13.397 --> 03:24:19.678]  Some new polls coming out showing where the horses are ranked in this horse race.
[03:24:19.678 --> 03:24:23.239]  And I want to finish up with what I was talking about with the Glenn Schools.
[03:24:23.239 --> 03:24:28.841]  But before I do, I just want to let you know that at the end of this show, we have a couple of specials that are going to be ending with the show.
[03:24:29.501 --> 03:24:34.445]  The 25% off the liver cleanse pack that will be ending at the end of this show, the end of this hour.
[03:24:34.445 --> 03:24:44.374]  That's the InfoWars Life liver cleanse pack, including the powerful oxygen colon cleanser, oxy powder, and our liver cleansing formulation, liver shield.
[03:24:44.374 --> 03:24:49.418]  And although there will still be a 10% discount on InfoWars select food, free shipping.
[03:24:50.038 --> 03:24:51.159]  A big savings.
[03:24:51.159 --> 03:24:55.661]  Free shipping will end today on our line of InfoWars Select Food.
[03:24:55.661 --> 03:24:58.983]  That's food that is packaged in the U.S.
[03:24:58.983 --> 03:25:00.784]  with all USA ingredients.
[03:25:00.784 --> 03:25:08.108]  It's packaged to last 25 years, and you can get that in a great deal right now just through the end of this hour.
[03:25:08.108 --> 03:25:14.592]  This is a sale that's been going on for quite some time, but we are ending the free shipping with the end of this show at the end of this hour.
[03:25:15.788 --> 03:25:19.724]  Now quickly wrapping up with what I was talking about with Fatala Gulen.
[03:25:20.799 --> 03:25:32.568]  This was brought up again, not only by the documentary that I was able to see in a preview a week last Saturday, but also because there were more arrests in Turkey.
[03:25:32.568 --> 03:25:46.500]  Erdogan, the president of Turkey, or his prime minister, I'm not really sure what the office is there, Turkish police have arrested 44 people suspected of having links to an exiled Islamic cleric accused of seeking to overthrow the government.
[03:25:47.020 --> 03:25:51.804]  And again, seeking to establish an Islamic caliphate.
[03:25:51.804 --> 03:25:54.305]  A multinational Islamic caliphate.
[03:25:54.305 --> 03:25:59.269]  And this guy, Fatala Gulen, has set up a thousand schools around the world.
[03:25:59.269 --> 03:26:01.971]  He's got over 120 here in America.
[03:26:01.971 --> 03:26:06.534]  Just in Texas alone, he's getting $100 million in taxpayer funds.
[03:26:06.534 --> 03:26:11.038]  In some countries, like Tajikistan, at the beginning of the year, they threw them out of the country.
[03:26:11.678 --> 03:26:25.154]  Sayidovich, Tajikistan's Minister of Education and Science, announced that he would not extend the agreement that they'd made with the Gulen movement over permission to operate schools in the country, since they consider the mission of the schools to be shadowy.
[03:26:25.154 --> 03:26:26.376]  Shadowy.
[03:26:26.376 --> 03:26:30.701]  For the last decade, they say, the purposes of the schools have become a hot debate in the Turkish government.
[03:26:31.542 --> 03:26:45.196]  Continue to see every couple of weeks 40, 50, 60 people arrested that are part of the government, part of the police, because Erdogan considers them being involved in trying to overthrow that government and set up an Islamic caliphate.
[03:26:45.196 --> 03:26:49.240]  And these are the people who are setting up subsidized schools in America.
[03:26:50.598 --> 03:26:53.980]  Encouraged, brought into this country by the CIA.
[03:26:53.980 --> 03:27:03.024]  The same people that equipped and trained ISIS in Syria are now equipping and training your children in charter schools in America.
[03:27:03.024 --> 03:27:04.844]  That's the bottom line, folks.
[03:27:04.844 --> 03:27:11.147]  Now, they go on to say that the movement is allegedly involved in unsettling routines around the world where there's dozens of schools owned by the movement.
[03:27:11.147 --> 03:27:14.969]  The members of the movement currently accused of attempting to oust the government in Turkey
[03:27:16.090 --> 03:27:17.911]  And that was December of last year.
[03:27:17.911 --> 03:27:26.859]  Turkish officials have an ongoing struggle with a parallel structure, a term that they use for members of the Glenn Movement in key government institutions.
[03:27:28.254 --> 03:27:29.095]  Let's go to politics.
[03:27:48.894 --> 03:27:52.698]  They had essentially Carson and Trump tied.
[03:27:52.698 --> 03:27:57.283]  Trump had 24%, Carson at 23% tied for first place essentially.
[03:27:57.283 --> 03:28:02.508]  Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz essentially tied at 13 and 14%.
[03:28:02.508 --> 03:28:06.552]  All the rest of the candidates in that national poll took 3% or less.
[03:28:06.552 --> 03:28:10.957]  There was also another poll, a tick that came up with about 11,000 respondents, I'm assuming
[03:28:11.557 --> 03:28:23.360]  That's a non-scientific poll, but it shows that Trump increased his lead after the debate, and Carson took a huge drop after the last debate.
[03:28:23.360 --> 03:28:28.541]  But I want to talk about an article that came out on Monday.
[03:28:28.541 --> 03:28:37.904]  Trump slams Obama's Syrian plan, but Carson is in favor of the plan, because I think it tells us a lot about the American electorate, not just about these two candidates.
[03:28:38.786 --> 03:28:43.612]  Now, what Trump said was he criticized Obama putting 50 troops in the ground.
[03:28:43.612 --> 03:28:45.654]  He says you either do it or you don't do it.
[03:28:45.654 --> 03:28:47.977]  50 people, he puts 50 people in.
[03:28:47.977 --> 03:28:50.300]  He's not serious about this.
[03:28:50.300 --> 03:28:55.547]  Okay, so Trump is taking a pragmatic approach, but he's still not looking at it constitutionally.
[03:28:56.047 --> 03:28:56.888]  Okay.
[03:28:56.888 --> 03:28:59.891]  But even more troubling is what Ben Carson says.
[03:28:59.891 --> 03:29:03.595]  He said the Syrian plan is a move in the right direction.
[03:29:03.595 --> 03:29:07.879]  But it still neglects the role that Russian President Putin is playing in the conflict.
[03:29:07.879 --> 03:29:09.441]  And listen to what he says next.
[03:29:10.287 --> 03:29:17.949]  My much, much, much bigger plan involves Putin and Iran also, said Carson on ABC's This Week.
[03:29:17.949 --> 03:29:20.670]  Those are the forces that are propping up the Assad regime.
[03:29:20.670 --> 03:29:25.052]  Even though Putin came in there and said he was going to fight ISIS, he's really fighting the anti-Assad forces.
[03:29:25.052 --> 03:29:25.972]  But look, look.
[03:29:27.182 --> 03:29:33.788]  Here he is talking tough with Putin, throwing the gauntlet down, escalating the tensions between the two countries.
[03:29:33.788 --> 03:29:41.695]  Does he have any concept whatsoever of what we're really going to have with increased and new Cold War?
[03:29:41.695 --> 03:29:44.317]  And where is the constitutional authority on any of this?
[03:29:44.317 --> 03:29:46.619]  Everybody sees the president as a Caesar.
[03:29:46.619 --> 03:29:48.320]  We truly have crossed the Rubicon.
[03:29:48.320 --> 03:29:49.401]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:29:49.401 --> 03:29:51.903]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.903 --> 03:29:54.586]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.513 --> 03:29:59.294]  You've heard of the U.S.
[03:29:59.294 --> 03:30:06.559]  government wasting money on studies like mountain lions on treadmills, shrimp on treadmills, and even the effects of Swedish massage on rabbits.
[03:30:06.559 --> 03:30:09.802]  This latest example of waste comes out of the Illinois EPA.
[03:30:09.802 --> 03:30:15.086]  In fact, I tweeted, state government needs nine-step anal-retentive plan to compost pumpkins?
[03:30:15.086 --> 03:30:16.427]  That's right, it's all in the article.
[03:30:16.427 --> 03:30:20.230]  Illinois EPA, pumpkins must be managed to protect human health by Kit Daniels.
[03:30:20.430 --> 03:30:26.656]  And in it, you can find a link to the actual nine-step process for local cities to collect pumpkins for composting.
[03:30:26.656 --> 03:30:27.637]  Here's step two.
[03:30:27.637 --> 03:30:34.563]  Pumpkins must not be accepted from other persons, including but not limited to owners and operators of rented or leased residences where pumpkins were used for decorative purposes.
[03:30:34.563 --> 03:30:38.326]  Commercial haulers and other commercial, industrial, agricultural, and government operations are entities.
[03:30:38.326 --> 03:30:39.467]  How are you going to figure that out?
[03:30:39.467 --> 03:30:40.148]  Step nine.
[03:30:40.148 --> 03:30:46.814]  The transfer and ultimate disposition of pumpkins received at the collection event must comply with the agency's approval, including all conditions contained in the approval.
[03:30:46.954 --> 03:30:49.095]  Do you have your TPS report cover sheet?
[03:30:49.095 --> 03:30:51.616]  Did you see the memo about this?
[03:30:51.616 --> 03:30:54.698]  If you don't, then you cannot compost pumpkins in Illinois!
[03:30:54.698 --> 03:30:55.298]  Okay.
[03:30:55.298 --> 03:30:58.279]  Rob Dury reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:30:58.279 --> 03:31:01.781]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:31:01.781 --> 03:31:06.783]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[03:31:06.783 --> 03:31:07.424]  We're good to go.
[03:31:28.163 --> 03:31:29.263]  BrainForce is here.
[03:31:29.263 --> 03:31:31.484]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:31:31.484 --> 03:31:36.466]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[03:31:36.466 --> 03:31:39.747]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:31:39.747 --> 03:31:43.248]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:31:43.248 --> 03:31:45.229]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:31:45.229 --> 03:31:47.329]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:31:47.329 --> 03:31:49.330]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[03:31:49.330 --> 03:31:54.932]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:31:57.873 --> 03:31:58.834]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[03:31:58.834 --> 03:31:59.395]  Good, brother.
[03:31:59.395 --> 03:32:01.356]  Just recently started using your products.
[03:32:01.356 --> 03:32:03.078]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[03:32:03.078 --> 03:32:07.102]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[03:32:07.102 --> 03:32:09.724]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[03:32:09.724 --> 03:32:12.147]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[03:32:12.147 --> 03:32:20.014]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[03:32:20.334 --> 03:32:23.556]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[03:32:23.556 --> 03:32:25.098]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[03:32:25.098 --> 03:32:28.140]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[03:32:28.140 --> 03:32:29.781]  Saving a ton of money there.
[03:32:29.781 --> 03:32:32.523]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[03:32:32.523 --> 03:32:35.585]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated.
[03:32:35.845 --> 03:32:37.626]  Or maximum potency.
[03:32:37.626 --> 03:32:47.834]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going, goes right to the source.
[03:32:47.834 --> 03:32:49.635]  So, it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[03:32:49.635 --> 03:32:56.580]  Visit Infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[03:33:01.357 --> 03:33:07.986]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:33:07.986 --> 03:33:10.969]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:17.011 --> 03:33:18.271]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.271 --> 03:33:22.333]  I'm David Knight, your host on this fourth hour, November 4th, 2015.
[03:33:22.333 --> 03:33:24.854]  Joining me in the studio now is Rob Due.
[03:33:24.854 --> 03:33:30.555]  And Rob Due is going to have some information about the elections that really kind of affect the health of the country.
[03:33:30.555 --> 03:33:32.696]  You know, elections really can make a difference.
[03:33:32.696 --> 03:33:42.559]  I think we get too caught up in the presidential elections and we don't really understand that at the local level, and I want to underscore this again, at the local level we can do things like get fluoride out of our water.
[03:33:42.559 --> 03:33:43.960]  We're going to give you some examples of that.
[03:33:45.026 --> 03:33:47.448]  That will really make a difference in our lives.
[03:33:47.448 --> 03:33:58.078]  I think they get us focused on the things that are the most distant, the most far away from us, things that aren't going to really affect our lives, and the presidential election is a good example of that.
[03:33:59.454 --> 03:34:03.335]  If we get into a war, that's going to affect all of us to a great deal.
[03:34:03.335 --> 03:34:14.619]  And I just want to go back to this and get Rob's comment on this story from Monday about Carson and Trump commenting on Obama sending 50 troops to Syria.
[03:34:14.619 --> 03:34:17.320]  Essentially, Trump is saying, go big or go home.
[03:34:18.220 --> 03:34:21.843]  And then Carson says, yeah, but my much, much bigger plan.
[03:34:21.843 --> 03:34:22.784]  I think that's a good idea.
[03:34:22.784 --> 03:34:26.146]  We need to send more troops, but I got a bigger plan that involves Putin.
[03:34:26.146 --> 03:34:27.588]  OK, I'm going to go to war with them.
[03:34:27.588 --> 03:34:38.837]  And I look at that and Rob, you know, I am just so ashamed that the person that everybody is out there touting as a Christian candidate is this warmonger like this.
[03:34:38.837 --> 03:34:42.840]  I remember when Ron Paul was in a debate, a GOP debate.
[03:34:43.420 --> 03:34:47.424]  And he quoted the Golden Rule when he was talking about foreign policy.
[03:34:47.424 --> 03:34:50.266]  And, I mean, he wasn't quoting the Founding Fathers.
[03:34:50.266 --> 03:34:51.607]  They reject the Constitution.
[03:34:51.607 --> 03:34:54.270]  They reject the principles of a non-interventionist government.
[03:34:54.270 --> 03:34:57.232]  He was quoting Jesus to these people.
[03:34:57.232 --> 03:34:59.154]  And the GOP... I think they laughed at him.
[03:34:59.154 --> 03:35:00.275]  Party lawyers, yeah, they booed him.
[03:35:00.555 --> 03:35:02.638]  They booed him and laughed at him.
[03:35:02.638 --> 03:35:12.612]  So when I see Ben Carson, the darling of the Christian wing of the Republican Party, saying, oh yeah, send more troops and I've got big plans for Putin, it's like, give me a break.
[03:35:12.612 --> 03:35:15.597]  And it makes me angry because I see them
[03:35:16.658 --> 03:35:17.239]  We're good to go.
[03:35:34.572 --> 03:35:46.981]  By Sheldon Richman, he points out that back in the 1930s, Congressman Ludlow tried to put through an amendment that said, we're not going to amend the Constitution saying, we're not going to accept even a congressional declaration of war.
[03:35:46.981 --> 03:35:50.304]  We want to have a referendum, because it's going to affect all the people.
[03:35:50.304 --> 03:35:51.805]  But we've lost the sense of that.
[03:35:52.105 --> 03:35:52.285]  Yeah.
[03:35:52.285 --> 03:35:53.366]  We don't think it's going to affect us.
[03:35:53.366 --> 03:35:53.906]  Your comments?
[03:35:53.906 --> 03:35:57.908]  Well, I think what Obama's doing is doing what we did in Vietnam.
[03:35:57.908 --> 03:35:59.569]  We sent some advisors in.
[03:35:59.569 --> 03:36:01.950]  Then we had to keep expanding and keep making it bigger.
[03:36:01.950 --> 03:36:02.850]  People started dying.
[03:36:02.850 --> 03:36:04.051]  We got to send more troops.
[03:36:04.051 --> 03:36:06.832]  And then all of a sudden we have 50,000 dead soldiers.
[03:36:06.832 --> 03:36:07.512]  Yes.
[03:36:07.512 --> 03:36:13.715]  At the end of 10, 15 years, it was a long buildup to get to where the Vietnam War finally ended in 74.
[03:36:13.715 --> 03:36:14.876]  I think they finally pulled people out.
[03:36:15.532 --> 03:36:17.293]  But, so that's what he's doing.
[03:36:17.293 --> 03:36:24.295]  And what Carson and Trump are saying, they're following the George Bush, we're going to shock and awe, go right in, and we're going to take it to the evildoers.
[03:36:24.295 --> 03:36:25.075]  Yeah.
[03:36:25.075 --> 03:36:29.696]  I can wage war better than Obama, and we need to be asking the question is, do we need to wage war?
[03:36:29.696 --> 03:36:31.657]  Yeah, and who gets to make that decision?
[03:36:31.657 --> 03:36:34.078]  The Constitution says right now that it belongs to Congress.
[03:36:34.078 --> 03:36:36.559]  I mean, maybe we shouldn't even leave it at that.
[03:36:36.559 --> 03:36:38.359]  Maybe it ought to be a direct referendum.
[03:36:38.359 --> 03:36:40.960]  But at least follow the Constitution if we're going to go to war.
[03:36:40.960 --> 03:36:42.761]  Yeah, it's totally ridiculous.
[03:36:44.421 --> 03:36:47.123]  Stomping around saying, I can outdo the war machine.
[03:36:47.123 --> 03:36:48.304]  I'm gonna do it bigger and better.
[03:36:48.304 --> 03:36:53.568]  And that, what the sad thing is, is that some Americans out there really do think that's the answer.
[03:36:53.568 --> 03:36:54.469]  More war.
[03:36:54.469 --> 03:36:57.511]  Well, one of them who thinks that it's an answer is Paul Ryan.
[03:36:57.511 --> 03:36:58.872]  The guy we just did have an election.
[03:36:59.292 --> 03:37:02.413]  And unfortunately, we caught Paul Ryan as Speaker of the House.
[03:37:02.413 --> 03:37:05.474]  And now he's starting to make pronouncements about what he's going to do.
[03:37:05.474 --> 03:37:08.594]  And he says, I'm a defense hawk.
[03:37:08.594 --> 03:37:09.415]  Maybe a war hawk.
[03:37:09.415 --> 03:37:10.815]  Maybe a chicken hawk.
[03:37:10.815 --> 03:37:12.535]  But yeah, he calls himself a defense hawk.
[03:37:12.535 --> 03:37:16.496]  He says that he wants to have a much bigger Navy.
[03:37:16.496 --> 03:37:18.197]  Big time, he says.
[03:37:18.197 --> 03:37:18.897]  So yeah, he says.
[03:37:19.557 --> 03:37:23.819]  What matters more for defense than one or two billion dollars is predictability.
[03:37:23.819 --> 03:37:27.921]  And we got that with this new raising of the debt ceiling.
[03:37:27.921 --> 03:37:29.041]  We got this predictability.
[03:37:29.041 --> 03:37:30.062]  And you know what?
[03:37:30.062 --> 03:37:35.204]  If he's going to make a much, much bigger Navy, that debt ceiling isn't going to last him for two years.
[03:37:35.204 --> 03:37:37.465]  It isn't going to last for a single year.
[03:37:37.465 --> 03:37:39.086]  We're going to have more of the same.
[03:37:39.086 --> 03:37:40.527]  This is what both parties want.
[03:37:41.327 --> 03:37:43.988]  But of course the Republicans really push that narrative.
[03:37:43.988 --> 03:37:46.289]  And one more thing I want to get your reaction to, Rob.
[03:37:46.289 --> 03:37:49.350]  Ryan says he will not cut Planned Parenthood.
[03:37:49.350 --> 03:37:56.893]  He goes on and he talks about, he says, this is with CNN's Dana Bash, he says, I think we need to be very clear about what we can and cannot achieve.
[03:37:56.893 --> 03:38:01.494]  And not set expectations that we know we can't reach, given the constraints of the Constitution.
[03:38:01.494 --> 03:38:03.455]  And the New American points this out and says, well wait a minute.
[03:38:03.815 --> 03:38:07.540]  There's nothing in the Constitution about funding Planned Parenthood, okay?
[03:38:07.540 --> 03:38:09.883]  So don't talk to me about constraints to the Constitution.
[03:38:09.883 --> 03:38:15.830]  Then he goes on to say, well, he says, what I mean by this is, so you're going to cut the funding?
[03:38:15.830 --> 03:38:20.076]  He says, well, when I say this, I'm being an opposition party.
[03:38:20.296 --> 03:38:22.257]  I'm being an effective opposition party.
[03:38:22.257 --> 03:38:26.538]  That means that I'm being honest with people up front about what we can and cannot achieve.
[03:38:26.538 --> 03:38:28.858]  And of course, they're not the opposition party.
[03:38:28.858 --> 03:38:30.959]  They control both houses of Congress.
[03:38:30.959 --> 03:38:36.760]  Both the Senate and the House are controlled by Republicans, and they won't stand up to Obama.
[03:38:36.760 --> 03:38:38.201]  And that's what you're going to get.
[03:38:38.201 --> 03:38:39.081]  More of Boehner.
[03:38:39.081 --> 03:38:39.641]  Exactly right.
[03:38:39.901 --> 03:39:02.701]  And this is a group that lies pretty much about everything that they do in terms of whether they say they're for women's health and yet they provide very few of those women's health services except for abortion which that seems to be the majority of what they provide and they do it in low-income areas so it seems to definitely be targeting a lower lower end of our populations you know to depopulate essentially.
[03:39:02.961 --> 03:39:03.641]  Exactly.
[03:39:03.641 --> 03:39:07.303]  He won't even stand up to make that slight of a cut.
[03:39:07.303 --> 03:39:09.344]  Something that his base desperately wants.
[03:39:09.344 --> 03:39:12.326]  But of course, he's going to ramp up the military big, big time.
[03:39:12.326 --> 03:39:14.927]  You know, when he talks about, well, it's only one or two billion dollars.
[03:39:14.927 --> 03:39:16.228]  That's what donors like to hear.
[03:39:16.228 --> 03:39:18.469]  Donors like to hear you're going to give me more money.
[03:39:18.769 --> 03:39:19.310]  Exactly.
[03:39:19.310 --> 03:39:23.853]  Only, that's right, the military-industrial conflicts, he just made them very, very happy.
[03:39:23.853 --> 03:39:30.139]  Of course, it was, I mean, decades ago, Senator Everett Dirksen said, well, a billion here, a billion there, pretty soon you're talking about real money.
[03:39:30.139 --> 03:39:31.200]  That's the mindset.
[03:39:31.200 --> 03:39:35.303]  That was like 50 years ago, but that was the mindset even then in Washington.
[03:39:35.303 --> 03:39:36.364]  It's far, far worse now.
[03:39:36.604 --> 03:39:37.085]  Yeah.
[03:39:37.085 --> 03:39:38.206]  So tell us about the elections.
[03:39:38.206 --> 03:39:41.570]  Tell us what happened with some of these, what's going on with the water.
[03:39:41.570 --> 03:39:43.992]  I'm going to get to that at the end of this whole piece.
[03:39:43.992 --> 03:39:50.579]  I've got a whole piece planned and it starts off with this article, Sacramento residents exposed to carcinogen in their drinking water.
[03:39:50.579 --> 03:39:53.563]  And I grabbed this, I'm like, oh, they're admitting fluoride's a carcinogen.
[03:39:53.903 --> 03:39:55.124]  Finally in the local media.
[03:39:55.124 --> 03:39:56.265]  No, that's not it.
[03:39:56.265 --> 03:40:05.112]  But this 10-minute report that I've pared down to just like the best stuff really goes into how the water boards treat their citizens.
[03:40:05.112 --> 03:40:12.917]  They were doing a test with this chemical called aluminum chlorohydrate to use that as a new additive to kind of get rid of particulates in water.
[03:40:12.917 --> 03:40:14.419]  So they did a whole year-long study.
[03:40:14.419 --> 03:40:15.940]  This stuff is carcinogenic.
[03:40:16.440 --> 03:40:27.282]  And then they have to add more chlorine because it doesn't really work well so they add more chlorine to the water which then creates this other disgusting carcinogen that also causes miscarriages in women.
[03:40:27.282 --> 03:40:30.843]  So let's roll the first clip which will kind of get us into what's going on here.
[03:40:30.843 --> 03:40:33.504]  I've got a few more and then we're going to get into the elections.
[03:40:33.504 --> 03:40:35.484]  Some people are kicking Florida out of their communities.
[03:40:35.484 --> 03:40:36.825]  Some people are inviting it back in.
[03:40:36.825 --> 03:40:37.785]  It's really disgusting.
[03:40:37.785 --> 03:40:38.565]  But here's the first clip.
[03:40:39.005 --> 03:40:44.089]  Investigation with some scary revelations about the city of Sacramento's drinking water.
[03:40:44.089 --> 03:40:48.812]  For almost a year, the city added a new chemical to the drinking water.
[03:40:48.812 --> 03:40:55.236]  It started as a short-term test of a water treatment chemical called aluminum chlorohydrate, or ACH.
[03:40:55.236 --> 03:40:59.819]  The chemical was temporarily replacing another water treatment chemical called alum.
[03:40:59.819 --> 03:41:03.842]  Sacramento's utility director says the test was all about one thing.
[03:41:04.102 --> 03:41:06.743]  There was an expectation that we'd be able to save quite a bit of money.
[03:41:06.743 --> 03:41:16.008]  In a report the city filed with state regulators, the city admits that the ACH chemical they were testing didn't do a good enough job removing some of those impurities.
[03:41:16.008 --> 03:41:20.791]  To make up for the chemical's lack of effectiveness, the city had to pump in more chlorine.
[03:41:20.791 --> 03:41:30.756]  And when the chlorine and these organic compounds spend too much time together, the chlorine can turn into disinfection byproducts, DBPs, in your drinking water.
[03:41:30.896 --> 03:41:45.504]  But the chemical trial went on for an entire year, and during that year, according to internal tests the city was performing, reading after reading went above what the EPA considers safe for long-term exposure to DBP.
[03:41:45.504 --> 03:41:49.446]  A city chemist noticed DBP problems on the third day of testing.
[03:41:49.446 --> 03:41:53.889]  She wrote in an email to managers, I'm nervous about the distribution samples.
[03:41:54.509 --> 03:41:59.835]  A chart that went along with that email showed DBPs way above the EPA limits.
[03:41:59.835 --> 03:42:04.401]  But Sacramento officials didn't call that state agency or stop the testing.
[03:42:04.401 --> 03:42:12.530]  Instead, they expanded it, telling the City Council they needed enough money to buy a truckload of ACH every week for a year.
[03:42:13.932 --> 03:42:15.713]  1,100 tons of it.
[03:42:15.713 --> 03:42:26.141]  In July of 2013, Busath and other utility officials told the council in a staff report that a one-year chemical trial was mandated by the state of California.
[03:42:26.141 --> 03:42:30.845]  That sounds like a good reason if the state mandated it, but it's also not true.
[03:42:30.845 --> 03:42:35.229]  And when we asked the city about that discrepancy with the state, we got this admission.
[03:42:35.589 --> 03:42:40.833]  The word mandate used in the council report was probably a poor choice of words.
[03:42:40.833 --> 03:42:47.459]  Every corner you turn on this particular project, you know, red flag, red flag, it's, you know, it's like peeling back an onion.
[03:42:47.459 --> 03:42:53.144]  There's just another layer of stuff that, you know, the closer you get to the center, the stronger the smell.
[03:42:54.830 --> 03:42:56.371]  Yeah, literally.
[03:42:56.371 --> 03:42:59.673]  And the guy Bob Bocock is his name.
[03:42:59.673 --> 03:43:01.755]  He's a water specialist.
[03:43:01.755 --> 03:43:03.276]  He works with Aaron Brockovich.
[03:43:03.276 --> 03:43:05.157]  And he was pulled into this interview.
[03:43:05.157 --> 03:43:06.838]  That's just part of this whole 10-minute report.
[03:43:06.838 --> 03:43:08.899]  We've got a couple more pieces of it.
[03:43:08.899 --> 03:43:10.921]  That's a lot of red flags right there.
[03:43:10.921 --> 03:43:13.082]  They knew the levels were high.
[03:43:13.082 --> 03:43:14.243]  They went ahead and kept doing it.
[03:43:14.243 --> 03:43:16.404]  And then they said, we need a year's supply worth of this.
[03:43:16.404 --> 03:43:19.807]  They say it's for saving money, which later on it comes out it's not for saving money.
[03:43:20.347 --> 03:43:37.678]  So it's interesting, Rob, this is Sacramento, of course, the California capital there, and we've had Tully Blackwood file reports with us showing how a closed Air Force base there, they just took massive piles of radioactive soil and it was left over from radium instruments that they were working on there, just left it!
[03:43:38.338 --> 03:43:43.042]  Above the soil is leeching into the water.
[03:43:43.042 --> 03:43:58.455]  Here we got an example of this state California that is supposedly so concerned about the environment and yet you have interests inside the government and that prevent them from doing anything because they have ties to corporations and they're just not effective stewards of the environment.
[03:43:58.655 --> 03:44:04.479]  And who knows how, like this ACH, you know, how that came up to being, oh, we got to start putting this in the water.
[03:44:04.479 --> 03:44:06.300]  But it turns out it doesn't really work.
[03:44:06.300 --> 03:44:07.361]  You have to add more chlorine.
[03:44:07.361 --> 03:44:09.682]  So you're using more chemicals, which is costing more money.
[03:44:09.682 --> 03:44:17.027]  Plus that stuff you have to end up, you know, if you're going to filter your water, that's going to take more filtering power, which is why we always recommend filtering your water anyway, because you never know.
[03:44:17.027 --> 03:44:19.849]  They didn't tell the citizens of Sacramento they were doing this.
[03:44:19.849 --> 03:44:21.430]  They did it for an entire year.
[03:44:21.430 --> 03:44:23.712]  Now, what do the DBPs do?
[03:44:23.712 --> 03:44:28.315]  Well, this is this is a little bit on clip two telling you what they actually do, what they can cause.
[03:44:29.596 --> 03:44:39.788]  This community was basically looked at as a laboratory guinea pig in that they were exposed for a period of up to one year without any proper notification whatsoever.
[03:44:39.788 --> 03:44:46.056]  Test after test revealed numbers in excess of the EPA safe drinking water standard of 80 parts per billion.
[03:44:46.676 --> 03:44:51.899]  Some people were drinking water with DBP levels above 130 parts per billion.
[03:44:51.899 --> 03:45:02.044]  People in Sacramento were never notified about the dangers, never given that choice to opt for bottled water, even though the city had all kinds of data that showed they had a serious problem.
[03:45:02.384 --> 03:45:05.265]  DBPs are nothing to mess around with.
[03:45:05.265 --> 03:45:11.426]  In first trimester pregnancies, there's significant rise in miscarriages.
[03:45:11.426 --> 03:45:14.127]  And in third trimester, there's evidence of low birth weight.
[03:45:14.127 --> 03:45:15.167]  Why not stop it?
[03:45:15.167 --> 03:45:16.928]  Because these are carcinogens.
[03:45:16.928 --> 03:45:18.048]  And that's one thing.
[03:45:18.048 --> 03:45:19.048]  I mean, the carcinogens.
[03:45:19.048 --> 03:45:24.410]  But we know that, you know, for pregnant women, unborn children, this is bad stuff.
[03:45:24.410 --> 03:45:27.671]  Because we had the anticipation of saving money with using ACH.
[03:45:29.011 --> 03:45:30.172]  Or maybe making money.
[03:45:30.172 --> 03:45:33.054]  Because that's how fluoride started.
[03:45:33.054 --> 03:45:39.059]  They would have to dispose of this toxic waste and pay for it, or they could dump it into your drinking water and get you to pay for it.
[03:45:39.059 --> 03:45:39.579]  Exactly.
[03:45:39.579 --> 03:45:46.905]  And this guy that they're interviewing, this bureaucrat, I mean, he needs to be immediately fired, replaced with somebody.
[03:45:46.905 --> 03:45:50.248]  I mean, let's put somebody else in there who can at least do a job.
[03:45:50.248 --> 03:45:51.449]  I mean, his answers
[03:45:52.129 --> 03:45:53.050]  He's very evasive.
[03:45:53.050 --> 03:45:55.471]  It's all about we're saving money, saving money.
[03:45:55.471 --> 03:45:56.712]  We were mandated.
[03:45:56.712 --> 03:45:57.933]  They lied about that.
[03:45:57.933 --> 03:45:59.474]  They made these tests for over a year.
[03:45:59.474 --> 03:46:02.135]  The levels were above what they should have been for over a year.
[03:46:02.135 --> 03:46:03.896]  But we're not even getting to the meat of the whole thing.
[03:46:03.896 --> 03:46:05.117]  There's a whole cover-up that goes on.
[03:46:05.117 --> 03:46:08.179]  They actually did the tests to send to the EPA.
[03:46:08.179 --> 03:46:13.282]  They would shut off the water supply from that particular plant that was doing the test and get it from other plants.
[03:46:13.282 --> 03:46:16.484]  Let's roll that third clip and you can just see the cover-up intensifying.
[03:46:17.532 --> 03:46:29.715]  Our ABC10 investigation found that even though city officials were aware of those internally high DBP numbers, the city held the EPA tests at times when they knew DBP numbers would be lower.
[03:46:29.715 --> 03:46:40.618]  For one test in January 2014, the Sacramento River plant where the chemical test was being performed was turned off for repairs and they got water from an American River plant.
[03:46:40.618 --> 03:46:44.399]  That drove the numbers way down, masking the DBP problem.
[03:46:44.779 --> 03:46:54.781]  And for another of those quarterly tests, emails obtained by ABC10 reveal that the city intentionally switched water sources days before an EPA test.
[03:46:54.781 --> 03:47:02.363]  The subject of one email, request for emergency water service from Sacramento County Water Agency to the City of Sacramento.
[03:47:02.363 --> 03:47:03.603]  The emergency?
[03:47:03.603 --> 03:47:10.265]  If the city didn't get water from another source, it was certain to exceed yearly standards for its disinfection byproducts.
[03:47:11.025 --> 03:47:15.947]  And about the city's overall claim that they did this for cost savings, that doesn't add up either.
[03:47:15.947 --> 03:47:22.950]  We analyzed city records, and not only was the original chemical safer, it appears to us it was also cheaper.
[03:47:22.950 --> 03:47:30.213]  We want to stress, and this is important, that the drinking water the city is now pumping is by every indication and measurement safe.
[03:47:34.235 --> 03:47:40.178]  They need to do an audit of the finances of those people who are making that decision if they really want an answer to who's paying them off.
[03:47:40.178 --> 03:47:48.941]  Well, and you got into the bottom of this and they put a link to their 2014 water quality report, so I, of course, being my nosy little self, went to read that report.
[03:47:48.941 --> 03:47:59.886]  And guys, pull that up, please, because it's kind of hard to see on this printout, but 1, 2, 3, 4, the fourth item down there, oh, they got fluoride in their drinking water.
[03:48:00.626 --> 03:48:02.548]  But what do they have it at?
[03:48:02.548 --> 03:48:03.148]  0.8?
[03:48:03.148 --> 03:48:04.909]  That's their range, 0.8.
[03:48:04.909 --> 03:48:09.292]  And then between 0.7 and 0.12 is their range in the groundwater and in the surface water.
[03:48:09.292 --> 03:48:13.135]  And they say it's an additive for, what does it say?
[03:48:13.135 --> 03:48:15.257]  Promotes strong teeth.
[03:48:15.257 --> 03:48:16.318]  That's what they say.
[03:48:16.318 --> 03:48:17.478]  Keep this in writing so small.
[03:48:17.478 --> 03:48:18.159]  There it is.
[03:48:18.159 --> 03:48:19.880]  Promotes strong teeth.
[03:48:19.880 --> 03:48:20.441]  But look at this.
[03:48:21.221 --> 03:48:25.225]  Back in, this is 2015, April 2015, U.S.
[03:48:25.225 --> 03:48:28.607]  lowers fluoride levels in drinking water for the first time in over 50 years.
[03:48:28.607 --> 03:48:31.810]  They dropped it down to 0.7, should be the maximum it should be.
[03:48:31.810 --> 03:48:33.091]  They're going up to 1.2.
[03:48:33.091 --> 03:48:36.414]  So that's their minimum is 0.7.
[03:48:36.414 --> 03:48:39.797]  Yeah, they start it where the EPA says it's the max and they go up from there.
[03:48:40.077 --> 03:48:41.458]  And now why is that bad?
[03:48:41.458 --> 03:48:52.982]  Well, and you guys can roll this whenever you want, it's the footage I shot whenever we went to the fluoride, the water treatment plant here in Austin and shot some hidden camera footage of their fluoride processing facilities.
[03:48:52.982 --> 03:48:58.544]  But here we have the articles from 2013, Harvard study confirms fluoride reduces children's IQ.
[03:48:59.444 --> 03:49:04.627]  From the Environmental Working Group, Harvard study, strong link between fluoridated water and bone cancer.
[03:49:04.627 --> 03:49:13.251]  So here we have a carcinogen admittedly being added to their water to promote healthy teeth, so called for that, but it says it causes bone cancer in boys.
[03:49:13.251 --> 03:49:17.854]  When we look at those levels, is that the level for an adult male?
[03:49:17.854 --> 03:49:19.134]  Is that the level for an 8-year-old child?
[03:49:19.134 --> 03:49:19.294]  Exactly.
[03:49:19.294 --> 03:49:20.395]  And how much water do you drink?
[03:49:20.395 --> 03:49:21.696]  How much water do you drink, David?
[03:49:21.696 --> 03:49:24.217]  Some people drink a lot of water, some people don't drink as much water.
[03:49:24.417 --> 03:49:25.998]  And it's being put in the water.
[03:49:25.998 --> 03:49:28.620]  That's why they've got a range that's nearly 2 to 1.
[03:49:28.620 --> 03:49:33.463]  Because when you dump something in the water, you have no control over the dosage that you're going to get.
[03:49:33.463 --> 03:49:39.307]  So they give the same dosage range to everybody, regardless of how much water they drink or their age.
[03:49:39.307 --> 03:49:44.751]  And then they don't even have any control over that, because they're just dumping the medication.
[03:49:44.751 --> 03:49:49.534]  If you thought this was safe and effective, why would you want it dumped in the water where you can't control it?
[03:49:49.534 --> 03:49:51.955]  Maybe you're not going to get enough if you think this is good stuff.
[03:49:54.417 --> 03:49:54.997]  I don't think so.
[03:50:18.265 --> 03:50:19.566]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[03:50:19.566 --> 03:50:22.448]  That's what they put in our water here in Austin.
[03:50:22.448 --> 03:50:25.330]  About 9 gallons per hour they dump in there.
[03:50:25.330 --> 03:50:27.351]  That was the statistic that really shocked me the most.
[03:50:27.351 --> 03:50:29.572]  But there's your MSDS of 4.
[03:50:29.572 --> 03:50:30.473]  Very important.
[03:50:30.473 --> 03:50:32.294]  I remember when you guys did that undercover video.
[03:50:32.294 --> 03:50:32.894]  It was really good.
[03:50:32.894 --> 03:50:35.296]  You could see the corroded pipes.
[03:50:35.296 --> 03:50:37.097]  What 4Hyd was doing to the pipes.
[03:50:37.097 --> 03:50:39.578]  I don't even want to think about what it's doing to my pipes.
[03:50:39.578 --> 03:50:40.519]  Eating out the concrete.
[03:50:40.519 --> 03:50:41.539]  And that's what it does to your bones.
[03:50:41.539 --> 03:50:42.800]  It eats away at them.
[03:50:42.800 --> 03:50:47.483]  So we're going to break, but when we come back I guess let's get into what people are doing to get it out of their communities.
[03:50:47.523 --> 03:50:49.007]  All right, we'll be right back with Rob Dew.
[03:50:49.007 --> 03:50:49.889]  I'm David Knight.

[03:50:59.577 --> 03:51:08.279]  My name is Don Whiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:08.279 --> 03:51:09.759]  What did I do?
[03:51:09.759 --> 03:51:17.680]  I created ExtendoVite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.

[03:54:04.568 --> 03:54:05.769]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:05.769 --> 03:54:11.093]  I'm David Knight in studio with Rob Dew and Jakari Jackson, who will be hosting the nightly news tonight.
[03:54:11.093 --> 03:54:17.057]  Real quickly, you've only got a few minutes to take advantage of two specials that are going to end with this show.
[03:54:17.057 --> 03:54:21.440]  First one is free shipping and 10% off of all InfoWars Select food.
[03:54:21.440 --> 03:54:23.661]  You can find that at InfoWarsSelect.com.
[03:54:23.661 --> 03:54:26.723]  That free shipping is going to end with the end of this show.
[03:54:26.723 --> 03:54:28.684]  Also, the 25% off the liver cleanse pack that
[03:54:29.565 --> 03:54:32.510]  That's the Oxy Powder and Liver Shield together.
[03:54:32.510 --> 03:54:34.113]  That's 25% off of that pack.
[03:54:34.113 --> 03:54:38.640]  That will also end with this show in just about five minutes or so.
[03:54:39.540 --> 03:54:44.184]  Now let's go back to Rob, and Rob, finish up with what you're telling us about the election.
[03:54:44.184 --> 03:54:49.708]  We had some places where they put fluoride in the water, but somewhere they took it out.
[03:54:49.708 --> 03:54:50.228]  Some good news.
[03:54:50.228 --> 03:54:50.729]  That's right.
[03:54:50.729 --> 03:54:56.893]  The city of San Marcos, just south of us, about 30 minutes, voted at 61% to remove it from their water supply.
[03:54:56.893 --> 03:55:00.256]  Half the city receives fluoridated water, half the city doesn't.
[03:55:00.256 --> 03:55:04.079]  I personally know a city councilman there, and I was actually educating him about fluoride.
[03:55:04.079 --> 03:55:06.441]  Told him to read the back of his toothpaste, he'd never done that before.
[03:55:06.881 --> 03:55:08.062]  You need to do that with your friends.
[03:55:08.062 --> 03:55:11.345]  Read the back of the toothpaste, you see the dangers there, you don't ingest it.
[03:55:11.345 --> 03:55:13.446]  Why are you putting it in your water?
[03:55:13.446 --> 03:55:16.689]  If you're not supposed to ingest the toothpaste coming out of your toothpaste roll.
[03:55:16.689 --> 03:55:17.349]  Exactly.
[03:55:17.349 --> 03:55:23.794]  And then we also have Chikuro, which is North Bay area, North Bay City, or the city of North Bay.
[03:55:23.794 --> 03:55:30.800]  They are talking about getting it out and they've said they're not going to, if people vote to pull it out, they're not going to mandate it back in, which is good.
[03:55:31.440 --> 03:55:39.344]  Now you have, on the other side, an Arab, uh, this is Arab, uh, I think it's in, uh, where is this at?
[03:55:39.344 --> 03:55:40.004]  This is Alabama.
[03:55:40.004 --> 03:55:41.105]  Arab, Alabama.
[03:55:41.105 --> 03:55:45.287]  They are mandating it go back into the water supply after the people voted to pull it out.
[03:55:45.287 --> 03:55:47.528]  And they, all this is done mainly for cost savings.
[03:55:47.528 --> 03:55:48.729]  They're not even doing it on the health issues.
[03:55:48.729 --> 03:55:52.190]  They're saying we can save money in the short term by not putting it in our water supply.
[03:55:52.190 --> 03:55:52.611]  Yeah.
[03:55:52.611 --> 03:55:54.191]  But now these guys are adding it back in.
[03:55:54.191 --> 03:55:58.113]  Now how do you justify that when it's something that's that expensive and the voters say they don't want it?
[03:55:58.113 --> 03:55:59.014]  I mean, they've got to be...
[03:55:59.554 --> 03:56:07.440]  Well, they've got program doctors that they bring in and say, look, if we don't do this, we're going to have higher rates of dental cavities, when now it shows that it doesn't even help for cavities.
[03:56:07.440 --> 03:56:09.602]  So that's another lie that they just keep pushing and pushing.
[03:56:09.602 --> 03:56:13.325]  And then when you go to the city council with the Harvard documents, the mayor gives you the finger.
[03:56:13.325 --> 03:56:14.366]  Yeah, and laughs at you.
[03:56:14.366 --> 03:56:19.790]  And then finally, Snowmass up in Colorado, they are putting it back in the water supply, unfortunately.
[03:56:19.790 --> 03:56:26.295]  Yeah, I mean, why would you add a chemical that is deadly if it comes in contact with you into your water supply and telling you it's good for your teeth?
[03:56:26.295 --> 03:56:26.976]  I don't understand it.
[03:56:27.356 --> 03:56:29.437]  Mass Medicaid people through the water supply.
[03:56:29.437 --> 03:56:30.598]  Absolutely insane.
[03:56:30.598 --> 03:56:33.179]  Now next Tuesday we're going to be doing the GOP debate.
[03:56:33.179 --> 03:56:41.823]  The next GOP debate we're going to have live coverage and commentary as we do and of course Jakari Jackson is going to be there with us and Rob will be running the board.
[03:56:41.823 --> 03:56:47.286]  Somebody tweeted out a title, Liberty Science Theater 3000 instead of Mystery Science Theater 3000.
[03:56:47.286 --> 03:56:51.708]  So, showing, you know, breaking down the lies in real time is what I like to say.
[03:56:52.348 --> 03:56:53.549]  Yeah, because we really do do that.
[03:56:53.549 --> 03:57:02.952]  Yeah, kind of think of it as, you know, your DVD when you've got a commentary track there from the director and other people who are in it, talking about what's going on with the movie.
[03:57:02.952 --> 03:57:10.814]  So you'll be able to hear, we'll occasionally let them speak and you can hear what they say occasionally, but we basically are looking at the subtitles.
[03:57:10.814 --> 03:57:14.796]  If you want to listen to it on another channel and get our commentary, you can do that as well.
[03:57:15.416 --> 03:57:23.271]  Really, they're not going to be saying that much that's interesting, but we will comment on it when they do come up with something interesting and we'll kind of hold their feet to the fire.
[03:57:23.271 --> 03:57:24.593]  Tell us what's on the news tonight, Chicago.
[03:57:25.165 --> 03:57:26.406]  Well, we're going to talk about a lot of stuff.
[03:57:26.406 --> 03:57:30.429]  We're going to re-air Wayne Madsen's report that aired today on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:30.429 --> 03:57:33.531]  So, if anybody missed that, you can see that again on the Nightly News.
[03:57:33.531 --> 03:57:36.673]  Also, a record number of Americans on prescription pills.
[03:57:36.673 --> 03:57:39.895]  And as we were talking about the debate, I believe it was Huckabee who said in the last debate,

[03:58:13.559 --> 03:58:14.419]  Thanks for joining us.
