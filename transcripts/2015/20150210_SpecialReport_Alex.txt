[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.923]  This is Jakari Jackson for InfoWars.com.
[00:00:11.223 --> 00:00:15.367]  I'm a big fan of the Conan O'Brien Show and he recently decided to get in on the vaccine debate.
[00:00:15.607 --> 00:00:16.648]  Let's take a look at this clip.
[00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:24.095]  Safe environment for all children, vaccinated and unvaccinated.
[00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:26.958]  To grow together as complete equals.
[00:00:29.744 --> 00:00:35.349]  And I like Conan, but as a fan of his show, when I saw this, I just couldn't help myself but make a video about it.
[00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.216]  But before we get into my opinions and just flat out facts that I will present to you in a moment, let's ask a doctor what he thinks about the situation.
[00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:46.320]  So how do you convince me, how do you convince the other parents out there that we need to do this?
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.444]  Careful, I'm going to get it, if that helps at all, but I'll tell you my wife is not getting me as her kids.
[00:00:50.864 --> 00:00:53.647]  Because I've got four of them, and when I go home, I'm not Dr. Oz, I'm Mr. Oz.
[00:00:54.227 --> 00:00:55.148]  So you heard it right there.
[00:00:55.268 --> 00:00:57.949]  When he goes home, he's not Dr. Oz, he's Mr. Oz.
[00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:00.890]  And his wife said, I'll be damned if you vaccinate my kids.
[00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.532]  Now let me be very clear when I talk about vaccines.
[00:01:03.612 --> 00:01:05.533]  I don't think vaccines are inherently evil.
[00:01:05.993 --> 00:01:08.314]  I don't think that medication in general is bad.
[00:01:08.654 --> 00:01:14.117]  But if you read these vaccine inserts, you'll see that they can cause harmful side effects, sometimes that are more severe.
[00:01:14.577 --> 00:01:17.480]  He seems like a completely competent doctor, but I don't understand any of the
[00:01:40.122 --> 00:01:49.590]  And that clip is for everybody who says, well if vaccines are harmful in any way, why don't we see people on TV talking about it?
[00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.831]  You just saw somebody on TV talking about it.
[00:01:52.192 --> 00:01:53.673]  And Pierce Morgan isn't the only one.
[00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:59.498]  That was the influenza vaccine, but they also have the HPV vaccines that Katie Couric talked about on her program.
[00:02:00.063 --> 00:02:04.404]  Right before 8th grade, my doctor convinced my mom to give me Gardasil.
[00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:06.844]  He said it was supposed to prevent cervical cancer.
[00:02:07.104 --> 00:02:12.686]  He highly encouraged me to get the vaccine, even though we had no history of cervical cancer in our family.
[00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:17.527]  So I ended up getting all three shots, and then after each shot, I got sick.
[00:02:17.807 --> 00:02:20.767]  After the first two shots, I was sick for about a week each time.
[00:02:21.027 --> 00:02:23.688]  And after the third shot, I got sick without getting better.
[00:02:24.395 --> 00:02:28.617]  She was nauseous and she had severe headaches and she couldn't get it out of the bed.
[00:02:28.717 --> 00:02:31.079]  But that segment got Katie Couric in some hot water.
[00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:35.521]  As you can see, Katie Couric's show on HPV vaccine sparks backlash.
[00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:40.664]  The people who get a lot of funding from the pharmaceutical companies weren't happy about that at all.
[00:02:41.124 --> 00:02:46.812]  The segment included personal stories from two moms who claim their daughters suffered serious harm from the vaccine.
[00:02:47.093 --> 00:02:47.854]  One of them died.
[00:02:48.274 --> 00:02:57.368]  In addition, the show featured two physicians, one who researched the vaccine and thinks its long-term protection benefits are oversold, and one who recommends them to her patients.
[00:02:58.027 --> 00:03:02.389]  And once again, if vaccines are harmful in any way, why don't you hear people on TV talking about it?
[00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.690]  Another person on TV talking about it.
[00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:06.511]  But let's talk about vaccines in general.
[00:03:06.531 --> 00:03:07.332]  I got several here.
[00:03:07.392 --> 00:03:08.332]  I got meningitis.
[00:03:08.752 --> 00:03:09.613]  I got influenza.
[00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:11.914]  So we'll go over some of these inserts and share them with you guys.
[00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:15.796]  And this is the influenza insert provided to me by the Walgreens Pharmacy.
[00:03:16.316 --> 00:03:17.277]  Possible side effects.
[00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:39.228]  Let's see, we have back pain, chills, shivering, cough, diarrhea, general body discomfort, headache, irritability, mild bruising, pain, redness, swelling or tenderness at the injection site, mild fever, muscle aches, sore throat, stuffy nose, severe side effects, burning, numbness, tingling, decreased movement of the facial muscles,
[00:03:39.648 --> 00:03:42.171]  Decreased movement or sensation in the arm or shoulder.
[00:03:42.531 --> 00:03:42.931]  Fainting.
[00:03:43.272 --> 00:03:44.132]  Loss of appetite.
[00:03:44.473 --> 00:03:45.133]  Muscle weakness.
[00:03:45.413 --> 00:03:45.894]  Seizures.
[00:03:46.174 --> 00:03:48.096]  Severe or persistent headache or fever.
[00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:49.157]  Vision changes.
[00:03:49.297 --> 00:03:49.697]  Vomiting.
[00:03:50.098 --> 00:03:52.620]  Which sounds to me a whole lot like the flu.
[00:03:53.061 --> 00:04:01.748]  So, I mean, maybe the plain semantics here, but it sounds like all the symptoms you can get potentially from the flu shot are just as bad, if not worse, than the flu itself.
[00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.031]  Decreased movement of the face muscles.
[00:04:04.051 --> 00:04:05.112]  Yeah, I never had that.
[00:04:05.772 --> 00:04:06.994]  That's just one of them.
[00:04:07.034 --> 00:04:10.658]  We also have meningitis, a very popular vaccine for college students.
[00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.570]  Fast heartbeat, dizziness and weakness.
[00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.031]  So once again, if you choose to vaccinate yourself or your kids, that's your business.
[00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:35.593]  But I think you do have a right to know these facts about the vaccines that they will not tell you in these late night joke sessions.
[00:04:35.973 --> 00:04:38.094]  Let's move them down to a hepatitis vaccine.
[00:04:39.294 --> 00:04:45.596]  The adverse reactions include, but definitely are not limited to a fever less than or equal to 100.4 degrees and 9.1 cases after the first dose.
[00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:58.376]  Or 11.3 after the second dose, which is to say about 10% of the cases, uh, you could potentially catch a fever from taking this hepatitis a shot.
[00:04:58.396 --> 00:05:02.298]  But of course they don't want to tell you that once again, you know, I'm not against vaccines.
[00:05:02.318 --> 00:05:06.180]  I'm not against medicines in general, but I think you should educate before you vaccinate.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.163]  And if these things concern you like they do me, definitely take that in consideration before you go get stuck.
[00:05:11.443 --> 00:05:14.165]  We'll end tonight with this, my favorite part of Conan's video.
[00:05:14.905 --> 00:05:16.026]  And it's always my,
[00:05:17.026 --> 00:05:26.214]  Bewilderment that people who are vaccinated are always so concerned about getting the disease, getting the virus from somebody else who is not vaccinated.
[00:05:26.254 --> 00:05:35.782]  So in this end clip, you'll see a child have their bubble punctured, and now they have to eject them from the school system, even though all the other children are vaccinated.
[00:05:35.882 --> 00:05:40.706]  And logically, the unvaccinated child should not be a threat to the other healthy children.
