[00:00:03.752 --> 00:00:07.755]  Despite the U.S.-led air campaign, the size of their fighting force, U.S.
[00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:10.857]  officials say, is increasing monthly.
[00:00:11.237 --> 00:00:21.684]  A 2012 Defense Intelligence Agency document declares the West, Gulf countries, and Turkey supported the opposition in Syria, namely al-Qaeda and Iraq, a precursor to ISIS.
[00:00:21.924 --> 00:00:28.168]  Right there, in the Pentagon's own words, al-Qaeda and ISIS were created to isolate the Syrian regime.
[00:00:28.488 --> 00:00:29.449]  Confirmed U.S.
[00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.231]  operation rooms backing Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[00:00:32.872 --> 00:00:33.112]  U.S.
[00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:43.561]  policy think tank Brookings Institution confirms that contrary to propaganda, U.S.-Saudi moderates and Turkey-Qatar Islamists have been coordinating all along.
[00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:50.687]  And then they're coordinating and commanding the groups in America, the U.K., and the E.U.
[00:00:52.287 --> 00:00:53.127]  So do you understand?
[00:00:53.647 --> 00:00:59.609]  I've told you this five hundred times in the last four years or more.
[00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.830]  Five hundred's conservative.
[00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:13.254]  Mainstream media answers with giving credence to an article in the ISIS magazine, Dabiq, that states First Lady Michelle Obama would be worth $40 on the terror group's slave market.
[00:01:13.434 --> 00:01:15.575]  Can you smell the stench of propaganda?
[00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:21.797]  The article was allegedly penned by a jihadi bribe said to be an ISIS recruiter of young women.
[00:01:21.857 --> 00:01:43.475]  The Michelle Obama as Jihadi sex slave story is merely another outrageous and sensationalistic propaganda piece among countless propaganda pieces, and thus build consensus for more direct military intervention in the Middle East, primarily in Syria, where the Bashar al-Assad regime continues to remain in power despite the effort of the US, the Gulf Emirates, and Turkey.
[00:01:43.855 --> 00:01:49.917]  The August 2013 DIA report predicted ISIS would declare a caliphate in Iraq and Syria.
[00:01:50.217 --> 00:01:59.781]  It stated this was exactly what the supporting powers of the opposition want in order to isolate the Syrian regime, which is considered the strategic depth of the Shia expansion.
[00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:06.243]  As noted, the supporting powers are the West, led by the United States and the Gulf Emirates and Turkey.
[00:02:06.443 --> 00:02:16.587]  The United States knew the opposition was dominated by jihadist elements it repeatedly described as moderate, and would ultimately coalesce into what is now called the Islamic State.
[00:02:16.767 --> 00:02:22.349]  The Pentagon report accurately describes the fall of both Mosul and Ramadi in Iraq to ISIS.
[00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.590]  Given this, and the fact that the U.S.
[00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.712]  coalition continuously aided the sectarian Syrian opposition knowing full
[00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:29.393]  We're good to go.
[00:02:48.075 --> 00:02:53.097]  ISIS took the historical site of Palmyra last week, and Palmyra is strategically located.
[00:02:53.497 --> 00:03:00.160]  It provides access to military bases and gas fields, in addition to highways leading to Damascus and the central city of Homs.
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.723]  Additionally, ISIS last week captured part of the industrial city of Sheikh Nahar in Syria's northern Aleppo province.
[00:03:08.123 --> 00:03:12.185]  It has also taken control of the Iraqi-Syrian border gate of Al-Walid.
[00:03:12.445 --> 00:03:17.107]  It is the third border crossing to fall into ISIS hands over the last few weeks.
[00:03:17.967 --> 00:03:28.298]  According to Syrian opposition activists, ISIS will not move on Damascus immediately, but will instead go to the Galta and break the siege so it can gain the support of people inside it.
[00:03:28.638 --> 00:03:33.002]  Analysts estimate ISIS now controls 50% of the country.
[00:03:33.283 --> 00:03:41.231]  In the short term, ISIS will be used to topple the government of Syria and convert the country into a failed state similar to the one created in Libya.
[00:03:41.551 --> 00:03:49.242]  Short of more direct support from Iran and Russia, al-Assad and the Syrian government cannot fend off ISIS indefinitely.

[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.862]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:04:05.962 --> 00:04:08.142]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:04:08.322 --> 00:04:13.524]  Indoor air has been shown to have 2 to 5 times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:04:13.684 --> 00:04:18.765]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:22.028]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:04:22.308 --> 00:04:26.232]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:30.756]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:40.945]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
