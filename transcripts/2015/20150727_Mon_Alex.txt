[00:00:01.356 --> 00:00:04.009]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:19.950]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.411]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.192 --> 00:00:23.093]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:27.358]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.938 --> 00:00:32.003]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.965 --> 00:00:41.506]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, July 27, 2015.
[00:00:43.107 --> 00:00:45.388]  I'm your host, David Knight.
[00:00:45.408 --> 00:00:47.930]  We're going to be joined later in the show by Alex Jones.
[00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.451]  He's doing investigative reporting in Europe.
[00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:57.334]  Of course, we all know what's happened with Greece, but there are other countries that are lined up along with this.
[00:00:57.855 --> 00:00:59.856]  Italy, Spain, Ireland.
[00:01:00.476 --> 00:01:05.300]  Portugal, all those countries are in for the same kind of treatment that we've seen in Greece.
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.062]  Are we going to learn anything from this?
[00:01:07.662 --> 00:01:15.269]  Is it a chance for us to stop the consolidation globally, or will it just be more corruption, more crony capitalism?
[00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:17.531]  Alex is in London today.
[00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:19.453]  He's going to be calling in and talking to us.
[00:01:19.493 --> 00:01:22.896]  We also have a special report from him that we're going to be playing later in the show.
[00:01:23.856 --> 00:01:27.280]  Today, we're going to look at some of the things that happened over the weekend.
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:35.288]  Of course, there was a special session yesterday where Rand Paul tried a gambit to get something done about Planned Parenthood.
[00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.432]  Ted Cruz is very upset about Mitch McConnell over the weekend.
[00:01:39.472 --> 00:01:42.855]  He just came out and flatly called him a liar.
[00:01:43.965 --> 00:01:45.446]  Very plain spoken.
[00:01:45.967 --> 00:01:47.248]  Very true, I believe.
[00:01:48.148 --> 00:02:05.641]  I don't agree with all the policies of Ted Cruz, but he's said and done some very good things, and I think one of the things that we need to do is we need to call out the leadership of the Republican Party when they get elected under false pretenses, when they lie to the American people, when they play games like they are with Obamacare.
[00:02:06.282 --> 00:02:12.507]  Again, this weekend what they did was they brought up all of Obamacare as a massive bill
[00:02:13.345 --> 00:02:18.606]  Knowing that it would get a straight-up or straight-down vote from the Republicans and the Democrats along partisan lines.
[00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:29.549]  Areas where they could scale it back, where they could start making some substantive changes with the levels of people that they have in the Senate right now, with the current makeup of the Senate.
[00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:31.989]  Those are ignored by the leadership.
[00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:36.210]  So they play these games, where they say, well, we had the vote and see it lost again.
[00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:38.797]  And that's what they're upset about.
[00:02:38.837 --> 00:02:41.480]  And so we're going to play the clip.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:53.253]  Actually, the Senate session today began with a reprimand from Orrin Hatch, part of the old guard, part of the corruption that is in Washington, part of the single party, and that's what
[00:02:53.813 --> 00:02:59.798]  Ted Cruz had rightfully pointed out, look, this is why Donald Trump is soaring in the polls.
[00:03:00.218 --> 00:03:03.121]  People are sick and tired of the lies.
[00:03:03.241 --> 00:03:04.041]  We see through them.
[00:03:04.322 --> 00:03:05.503]  Everybody sees through the lies.
[00:03:05.623 --> 00:03:16.872]  Anybody that pays the slightest attention to the political process understands these transparent lies are being told to them by both leaders, the leaders of both parties.
[00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:19.355]  It's Obama lying to his base.
[00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:26.624]  It's Nancy Pelosi lying to her base, talking about how they're for civil liberties, for their transparency, that they don't want to push war.
[00:03:26.644 --> 00:03:32.712]  It's about the Republicans lying to their base on economic issues that they feel are important.
[00:03:33.293 --> 00:03:34.495]  None of them do anything.
[00:03:34.935 --> 00:03:48.223]  And so when you have somebody that comes out like Donald Trump and calls them on their lies, addresses the problems that people see happening, the massive open borders, people coming in from all countries, this is not something about one particular country.
[00:03:48.243 --> 00:03:49.844]  It's not simply about Mexico.
[00:03:49.904 --> 00:03:56.308]  I think that's where Donald Trump has gone off the rails, to make it about one group of people, about one country.
[00:03:56.708 --> 00:03:58.429]  As we're going to see, this is broad-based.
[00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:59.770]  There is no limit to this.
[00:04:01.078 --> 00:04:06.299]  And there has to be a limit to the number of people that we can assimilate into the country at a given time.
[00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:09.880]  There also has to be a limit to what we do.
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:17.421]  We need to have equal treatment of Americans, at least treat us as well as the people who are coming here legally and illegally.
[00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:20.122]  And we need to do something about the war on drugs.
[00:04:20.162 --> 00:04:29.484]  Now we've got a report, Sheriff Joe is telling Donald Trump, let's go to Mexico and let's talk to them about really getting serious about the war on drugs.
[00:04:31.024 --> 00:04:31.264]  Really?
[00:04:31.284 --> 00:04:39.648]  After 40 some odd years of a failed war on drugs, it just gets more and more violent and pervasive?
[00:04:40.028 --> 00:04:40.988]  Yeah, it's a big problem.
[00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:52.193]  That's one of the big problems with these open borders, with our policies, is that the violence that we've seen in Mexico, with over 30,000 people, I don't know what the current number is, it's probably higher than that.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.005]  But the incredible violence that we've seen there, this has been going on for nearly 50 years.
[00:04:58.085 --> 00:04:59.927]  Our alcohol prohibition only went on for 13 years.
[00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:01.048]  So we're going to talk about that.
[00:05:01.088 --> 00:05:02.089]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:05:09.855 --> 00:05:19.777]  Last week, while on a campaign stop in Iowa, Donald Trump specifically mentioned the video Joe Biggs and Josh Owens shot showing illegal immigrants smuggling drugs into this country.
[00:05:20.037 --> 00:05:24.899]  And over the weekend, he retweeted a message from one of his campaign staffers with a direct link to the video.
[00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:30.500]  Actually, the camera crew, or the reporters, were petrified because they thought they were going to be killed.
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.881]  Because they're showing this on camera.
[00:05:32.901 --> 00:05:34.442]  The guy's carrying bags of stuff.
[00:05:34.462 --> 00:05:35.002]  It was drugs.
[00:05:35.282 --> 00:05:40.606]  Both Trump and Bernie Sanders are rising in the polls, as these two mavericks seem to be a threat to the establishment.
[00:05:40.746 --> 00:05:47.029]  But as Kurt Nimmo writes, the puppet masters behind the political facade have absolutely no fear of Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders.
[00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.353]  Both are part of a traveling sideshow on the road to the primaries in the November 2016 presidential election.
[00:05:52.593 --> 00:05:55.054]  Bush or Clinton will sit in the White House come January 2017.
[00:05:55.434 --> 00:05:59.397]  And everything between now and then is little more than pure political theater.
[00:06:00.257 --> 00:06:01.518]  You can read more in the article.
[00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:02.779]  Forget Trump and Bernie.
[00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:06.802]  Here's why Clinton or Bush will be the next president on InfoWars.com.
[00:06:07.102 --> 00:06:07.883]  Rob Due reporting.
[00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:14.721]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:06:14.861 --> 00:06:20.743]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:06:20.983 --> 00:06:25.584]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:06:25.764 --> 00:06:29.106]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:06:29.346 --> 00:06:30.906]  No needles, no injections.

[00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:42.730]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:51.033]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:06:51.274 --> 00:06:56.295]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:06:56.696 --> 00:06:58.977]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:10.882]  Another major health threat.
[00:07:10.922 --> 00:07:15.824]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:07:15.904 --> 00:07:18.525]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:07:18.565 --> 00:07:25.347]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:07:25.607 --> 00:07:28.468]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:07:28.588 --> 00:07:31.549]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:33.549]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:36.410]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:42.013]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:07:42.213 --> 00:07:45.715]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:07:45.735 --> 00:07:48.716]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:55.920]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[00:08:07.106 --> 00:08:31.523]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.612]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, July 27, 2015.
[00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:44.015]  I'm David Knight, your host here in Austin.
[00:08:44.575 --> 00:08:49.579]  Alex Jones is in England investigating the globalist takeover of Europe.
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:55.344]  He's going to be traveling to other areas besides England as part of this investigative reporting.
[00:08:55.364 --> 00:08:58.326]  He's going to be joining us later in the show with a live report.
[00:08:58.346 --> 00:09:01.329]  We're also going to have a special report from him at the bottom of this hour.
[00:09:01.909 --> 00:09:04.892]  Paul Joseph Watson will be joining us also in the show.
[00:09:05.888 --> 00:09:11.791]  Now, as we look at Europe, of course, Greece still does not have their capital controls lifted.
[00:09:12.152 --> 00:09:12.792]  Isn't that amazing?
[00:09:13.392 --> 00:09:17.655]  These people have been suffering under this punitive measure.
[00:09:17.935 --> 00:09:23.018]  Even after they have agreed to release the funds to them, the banks still have not done that.
[00:09:24.018 --> 00:09:29.301]  They came up with the first offer, remember, and they said, no, we don't want to accept that offer.
[00:09:29.321 --> 00:09:30.382]  That's what the Greek people said.
[00:09:30.422 --> 00:09:33.884]  And then they got subverted by their socialist leader,
[00:09:34.989 --> 00:09:51.009]  Alexis Tsipras, in the same way that Hugo Chavez betrayed his people for the bankers, giving them a 700% return on their investment as Bloomberg's Investment News bragged, been as well as a great place to invest.
[00:09:51.029 --> 00:09:51.590]  We get 700% investment.
[00:09:53.172 --> 00:09:57.914]  They understand that they need to take care of our debt before they do anything for the people.
[00:09:57.954 --> 00:10:04.998]  And so, in that same article, they were talking about how they were suffering from food and water and medicine shortages in Venezuela.
[00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:08.520]  Now we see the same thing happening again with a socialist leader.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.601]  The people think he's going to stand for the people.
[00:10:10.661 --> 00:10:18.865]  Instead, they use this facade, this veneer of standing for the people, even when they have a clear referendum, that they don't want to go down this road
[00:10:19.972 --> 00:10:20.793]  They do it anyway.
[00:10:20.893 --> 00:10:24.074]  And the second deal was far worse than the first one.
[00:10:25.415 --> 00:10:29.397]  They wound up with $50 billion worth of hard assets.
[00:10:29.678 --> 00:10:38.763]  Far more than the original loan was going to be in terms of just confiscating those assets and then piling new loans, extending and pretending this out into the future.
[00:10:39.423 --> 00:10:41.284]  And so now what we see is a question.
[00:10:42.125 --> 00:10:43.526]  This is from Yahoo News.
[00:10:44.446 --> 00:10:50.867]  Saying, how can Greece loosen the capital controls that are shielding its banks but strangling the rest of the economy?
[00:10:50.908 --> 00:10:53.528]  Because we don't really care about the rest of the economy.
[00:10:53.588 --> 00:10:55.629]  It's the banks that have to be shielded, right?
[00:10:56.169 --> 00:10:59.609]  They say for the past month, Greece has been financially cut off from the rest of the world.
[00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:10.192]  It's almost impossible for most Greeks to take money out of the country thanks to a raft of capital control measures that were put in place amid fears of catastrophic bank runs.
[00:11:11.331 --> 00:11:15.453]  They point out that most large depositors have removed their money already.
[00:11:15.473 --> 00:11:25.196]  They say the remaining uninsured deposits, about 30% of the deposit base, are mainly the working capital of Greek businesses, small businesses.
[00:11:25.556 --> 00:11:29.598]  These are the people that they came to and said, we're going to confiscate
[00:11:30.778 --> 00:11:33.520]  The money that's being paid to you by tour operators even.
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.701]  You're not going to be able to get that.
[00:11:34.721 --> 00:11:37.222]  We're going to interpose ourselves in here.
[00:11:37.262 --> 00:11:39.183]  We're going to confiscate that money.
[00:11:39.484 --> 00:11:42.586]  You provided the services, you provided the goods, but you're not going to get paid.
[00:11:42.886 --> 00:11:46.988]  The banks are going to take your money because they always come first because they write the rules.
[00:11:47.609 --> 00:11:54.693]  They say bailing in would be far more destructive for the Greek economy than the bail-in of large depositors was for Cyprus.
[00:11:54.713 --> 00:11:56.194]  See, they're still talking about the bail-in.
[00:11:57.261 --> 00:11:59.302]  Remember that was floated by a British paper.
[00:11:59.823 --> 00:12:04.586]  They were talking about bailing in deposits at 8,000 euros.
[00:12:05.287 --> 00:12:11.991]  Now understand that when they stole people's money out of the banks in Cyprus, they only did that for deposits that were over 100,000 euros.
[00:12:12.432 --> 00:12:16.655]  Because, like in the United States, they have depositor insurance.
[00:12:16.715 --> 00:12:18.876]  And that was the limit of depositor insurance.
[00:12:18.916 --> 00:12:23.339]  So as bad as it was, you could say, well, okay, they had that insured up to 100,000.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.742]  People understood that they didn't have insurance beyond that level.
[00:12:28.015 --> 00:12:38.797]  What they're saying here, though, is they floated the trial balloon more than once that they would go in down to the level of 8,000 euros, even though they've told people that those deposits are insured.
[00:12:39.617 --> 00:12:42.218]  Banks' words don't mean anything, right?
[00:12:42.938 --> 00:12:44.478]  That's what we're looking at here.
[00:12:45.038 --> 00:12:51.160]  So they're basically going to steal the working capital of the Greek people as they steal their infrastructure.
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.760]  And if you think it's not going to happen here,
[00:12:54.093 --> 00:13:01.998]  I mean, we are far more leveraged in terms of unfunded mandates and liabilities than the Greek people were.
[00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:10.923]  This is something that is absolutely possible and inevitable if we do not change the way we do business here.
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:22.824]  So Alex Jones is going to be investigating in Europe, filing reports, and as I said, we're going to have a special report from him at the bottom of the hour, and again in the next hour he's going to be joining us live.
[00:13:23.705 --> 00:13:24.165]  Now the U.S.
[00:13:24.185 --> 00:13:32.248]  Senate today opened with an interesting reprimand from Orrin Hatch, and I want to play that reprimand for you and then tell you what this is about.
[00:13:34.729 --> 00:13:38.170]  Deliberation without decorum is not deliberation at all.
[00:13:39.271 --> 00:13:39.951]  It is bickering.
[00:13:40.783 --> 00:13:44.166]  And bickering, Mr. President, is beneath this body.
[00:13:45.207 --> 00:13:54.774]  Regrettably, in recent times, the Senate floor has too often become a forum for partisan messaging and ideological grandstanding rather than a setting for serious debate.
[00:13:55.715 --> 00:14:08.665]  It has been misused as a tool to advance personal ambitions, a venue to promote political campaigns, and even a vehicle to enhance fundraising efforts, all at the expense of proper functioning of this body.
[00:14:09.904 --> 00:14:29.619]  Most egregiously, Mr. President, the Senate floor has even become a place where senators have singled out colleagues by name to attack them in personal terms and to impugn their character in blight and disregard of Senate rules, which plainly prohibits such conduct.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.304]  Mr. President, I thank the senior senator from Utah for an excellent speech.
[00:14:36.645 --> 00:14:39.447]  And I entirely agree with his call for civility
[00:14:40.456 --> 00:14:41.716]  And decorum and respect.
[00:14:43.177 --> 00:14:52.298]  No member of this body should engage in ad hominem attacks directed at any other member of this body, be they a Republican or be they a Democrat.
[00:14:54.359 --> 00:15:07.621]  At the same time, I would note that it is entirely consistent with decorum and with the nature of this body, traditionally as the world's greatest deliberative body, to speak the truth.
[00:15:09.247 --> 00:15:15.710]  Speaking the truth about actions is entirely consistent with civility.
[00:15:17.471 --> 00:15:32.297]  Indeed, in a quote often attributed falsely to George Orwell, the sentiment has been expressed thusly, in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:15:34.292 --> 00:15:34.732]  There you go.
[00:15:35.473 --> 00:15:42.197]  So they were angry with Ted Cruz because he had called out Mitch McConnell and said he had lied.
[00:15:43.377 --> 00:15:44.418]  And that is the truth.
[00:15:44.678 --> 00:15:46.439]  That is a revolutionary act.
[00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:47.520]  That is why
[00:15:48.655 --> 00:15:58.781]  As I said before in the previous segment, that's why Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are doing well in the polls, because they call these people out as liars.
[00:15:59.241 --> 00:16:12.829]  Now, of course, what Orrin Hatch was talking about, he said, the chair reminds all senators of the following paragraph from the rules, that no senator in debate shall directly or indirectly, in any form of words, impute to another senator any conduct or motives unworthy or unbecoming, etc., etc.
[00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:18.149]  As Ted Cruz pointed out, he didn't engage in ad hominem attacks.
[00:16:18.289 --> 00:16:21.012]  He didn't attack Mitch McConnell's personal life.
[00:16:21.252 --> 00:16:22.733]  He didn't attack his appearance.
[00:16:23.954 --> 00:16:26.636]  He attacked the substance of what he does.
[00:16:27.737 --> 00:16:31.200]  And if we can't attack that substance, then we have a real problem.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.783]  And this is the problem that Ted Cruz, this is why he called him a liar.
[00:16:34.843 --> 00:16:39.548]  They say, this is a report from, let's see, this article is from
[00:16:41.156 --> 00:16:42.839]  Well, I don't have the source here.
[00:16:42.859 --> 00:16:46.723]  It's not printed on the thing here, but it's Washington Post.
[00:16:47.404 --> 00:16:48.906]  They say that Cruz was unbowed.
[00:16:49.307 --> 00:16:58.819]  Firing back soon after leaving the Senate floor, he accused leaders of marching in lockstep with Democrats on things like the Affordable Care Act, funding Planned Parenthood,
[00:16:59.179 --> 00:17:03.501]  And refusing to tie an Iran nuclear deal to Iran's recognition of Israel's right to exist.
[00:17:04.081 --> 00:17:05.302]  He said they operate as a team.
[00:17:05.722 --> 00:17:06.843]  They expand Washington.
[00:17:07.103 --> 00:17:09.104]  They undermine the liberty of the people.
[00:17:09.364 --> 00:17:11.825]  He said we've just seen something extraordinary on the Senate floor.
[00:17:12.105 --> 00:17:20.389]  The American people elected a Republican majority believing that the Republican majority would somehow be different from a Democrat majority in the U.S.
[00:17:20.429 --> 00:17:20.729]  Senate.
[00:17:20.989 --> 00:17:25.131]  Unfortunately, the way the current Senate operates, there is a single party
[00:17:25.771 --> 00:17:27.013]  The Washington Party.
[00:17:27.053 --> 00:17:27.473]  That's right.
[00:17:27.874 --> 00:17:28.915]  You don't have a left wing.
[00:17:29.176 --> 00:17:30.177]  You don't have a right wing.
[00:17:30.197 --> 00:17:31.398]  You've only got one wing.
[00:17:31.479 --> 00:17:34.863]  And we're not going anywhere except going down.
[00:17:35.444 --> 00:17:41.352]  And that's where we're descending into an authoritarian government with everything centered in Washington.
[00:17:42.355 --> 00:17:45.678]  And again, to give you an idea of the kind of games that they play with this.
[00:17:45.718 --> 00:17:47.400]  And this is one of the things that they're upset about.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:54.627]  People say, well, Mitch McConnell had a vote on Obamacare, but he rigged it so that it was simply a symbolic vote.
[00:17:55.067 --> 00:17:58.911]  And that's what Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, others are so upset about.
[00:17:59.251 --> 00:18:03.195]  What he did was he had an up or down vote on the entire thing of Obamacare.
[00:18:04.502 --> 00:18:06.365]  He says we'll have a vote on repealing Obamacare.
[00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:07.708]  The Republicans will all vote yes.
[00:18:07.808 --> 00:18:08.970]  The Democrats will all vote no.
[00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.094]  It'll be a 60 vote threshold and it will fail.
[00:18:11.254 --> 00:18:12.656]  Ted Cruz saw this coming up.
[00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:13.999]  He said that's exactly what you're going to have.
[00:18:14.019 --> 00:18:16.884]  He says it'll be an exercise in meaningless political theater.
[00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:24.417]  Other senators have said, obviously, a full repeal and replace is not going to go with the current makeup of the Senate.
[00:18:24.517 --> 00:18:25.457]  But what could they do?
[00:18:26.078 --> 00:18:40.249]  Well, Senator Shelley Moore, Capito of West Virginia, said before the vote was scheduled, I would like to see us do things like move the work week back to 40 hours instead of defining a full-time employee as 30 hours.
[00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.792]  Some little things like that that could make a huge difference.
[00:18:44.213 --> 00:18:45.173]  Or you might even
[00:18:45.854 --> 00:18:55.987]  Put some teeth in it and say, you know what, the IRS is imposing fines that are 12 times the amount that was put in the Affordable Care Act.
[00:18:56.848 --> 00:19:00.612]  They're imposing fines 12 times higher than the Obamacare law.
[00:19:00.633 --> 00:19:01.353]  Do you understand that?
[00:19:02.486 --> 00:19:13.929]  The IRS, which was given 17,000 new IRS agents to persecute people over Obamacare, is now just arbitrarily setting the fees to be 12 times higher than what's in the law.
[00:19:13.969 --> 00:19:17.550]  So maybe what you could do is put some teeth into the law.
[00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:27.592]  But no, you just have business as usual with Mitch McConnell, with Orrin Hatch, with the leadership of John Boehner, and the rest of the Republicans there.
[00:19:28.905 --> 00:19:30.747]  Now Hillary Clinton has made news over the weekend.
[00:19:31.027 --> 00:19:31.767]  She's confident.
[00:19:31.788 --> 00:19:37.252]  She said she never sent or received any information that was classified at the time that it was sent and received.
[00:19:37.833 --> 00:19:40.395]  She had no textual relations.
[00:19:40.695 --> 00:19:44.959]  It's the same kind of denials that we saw coming out of Bill Clinton.
[00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:48.162]  The Inspector General has looked at these emails.
[00:19:48.702 --> 00:19:50.464]  Four out of the forty that he's looked at
[00:19:51.064 --> 00:19:53.246]  Had classified material in them.
[00:19:53.266 --> 00:19:55.127]  That's 10% of what he's looked at so far.
[00:19:55.147 --> 00:19:56.568]  And of course there's a lot to look at.
[00:19:56.828 --> 00:20:00.231]  There's 55,000 pages worth of emails.
[00:20:00.651 --> 00:20:01.692]  Stay with us when we come back.
[00:20:01.712 --> 00:20:04.614]  We're going to talk about where her money is coming from.
[00:20:05.601 --> 00:20:06.361]  You won't believe this one.
[00:20:06.962 --> 00:20:09.503]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:09.983 --> 00:20:11.824]  Healthy, organic, fresh fish.

[00:21:21.235 --> 00:21:23.256]  I'm not waiting for these people to defend me.
[00:21:23.376 --> 00:21:27.558]  If they don't know ISIS is here already, they got no clue, I'm taking care of myself.

[00:24:20.816 --> 00:24:26.198]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, July 27, 2015.
[00:24:26.258 --> 00:24:27.858]  I'm David Knight, your host in Austin.
[00:24:27.898 --> 00:24:31.119]  We're going to be talking to Alex Jones in the next hour.
[00:24:31.139 --> 00:24:32.399]  We have a live report from him.
[00:24:32.439 --> 00:24:33.120]  He's in London.
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:38.961]  He's investigating the globalist takeover of Europe, and of course there's many different aspects to it.
[00:24:39.001 --> 00:24:41.382]  There's what we see happening with Greece.
[00:24:41.442 --> 00:24:48.824]  There's also the transatlantic partnership that is coming up, along with the transpacific partnership, because the United States is right in the middle.
[00:24:49.909 --> 00:25:00.374]  We're part of the North American Union and we're kind of the spine for these other two wings that are coming in as Zbigniew Brzezinski created this, talking about the Trilateral Commission.
[00:25:01.215 --> 00:25:04.917]  Also, we have Paul Joseph Watson will be joining us later in the show as well.
[00:25:04.937 --> 00:25:11.840]  I want to go back to Hillary Clinton and I want to tell you who her latest corporate sponsors are.
[00:25:12.441 --> 00:25:16.082]  Very interesting story behind that for the people on the left.
[00:25:16.263 --> 00:25:17.623]  It should give them some chills.
[00:25:18.204 --> 00:25:18.904]  Before we do though,
[00:25:19.384 --> 00:25:27.026]  I'll let you know this half hour of the Alex Jones Show is brought to you by our newest flagship product from InfoWars Life, and that is Deep Cleanse.
[00:25:27.586 --> 00:25:29.947]  Deep Cleanse is an all-in-one total body cleanser.
[00:25:29.967 --> 00:25:32.008]  It uses nano-colloidal zeolites.
[00:25:32.128 --> 00:25:36.769]  Think of that as kind of small nano-sized sponges and other organic
[00:25:37.449 --> 00:25:38.450]  We're good to go.
[00:25:59.921 --> 00:26:05.226]  It'll be months before we get the next shipment in, but you can get yours right now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:26:05.627 --> 00:26:07.809]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:12.714]  Now going back to what we were talking about just before the break, Hillary Clinton's emails.
[00:26:13.395 --> 00:26:18.840]  She said, I'm confident that I never sent or received any information that was classified at the time.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.645]  See all the different prevarications in there, the different qualifications that she puts in there?
[00:26:24.537 --> 00:26:26.059]  A lot of people are not buying it.
[00:26:26.659 --> 00:26:28.201]  A lot of whistleblowers aren't buying it.
[00:26:28.281 --> 00:26:30.122]  Lawyers for whistleblowers aren't buying it.
[00:26:30.183 --> 00:26:34.807]  Jessalyn Radek, lawyer for Snowden, lawyer for Thomas Drake.
[00:26:34.847 --> 00:26:36.529]  I believe she was a lawyer for William Binney.
[00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:38.751]  She was a lawyer for a lot of the NSA whistleblowers.
[00:26:38.771 --> 00:26:41.273]  She was a whistleblower herself from the Justice Department, I think.
[00:26:42.895 --> 00:26:46.298]  She pointed out that people have been prosecuted.
[00:26:47.216 --> 00:26:52.681]  For releasing information that was classified, both before and after it was classified.
[00:26:52.701 --> 00:27:02.609]  In other words, in the case of Thomas Drake, what they came after him, what they tried to convict him for, were documents that were not anything that should have ever been classified.
[00:27:02.709 --> 00:27:06.672]  They weren't classified when he had them at his home.
[00:27:07.573 --> 00:27:12.037]  They went back retroactively and classified those documents as a way to entrap him.
[00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:17.894]  Now that's not the case with Hillary Clinton, but she is trying to spin this this way.
[00:27:17.934 --> 00:27:23.579]  But I want you to understand who really is behind Clinton.
[00:27:24.099 --> 00:27:38.812]  We've already reported about how Monsanto, ExxonMobil, Microsoft, the telecom industry are bundling money, thousands of times more money than they tried to get criminal convictions on, and did get a criminal conviction on, Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.203]  Now, Dinesh kind of skirted the exact rules there.
[00:27:44.243 --> 00:27:46.144]  He didn't redo all the reporting.
[00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:50.127]  There's a limit of $5,000 per person, but there are certainly ways to get around it.
[00:27:50.207 --> 00:27:56.712]  Tens of millions of dollars are coming from the corporate lobbyists who are bundling these contributions from these corporations.
[00:27:57.432 --> 00:28:04.738]  As I've always said, it was HL Minkin who said, an election is an advanced auction of stolen goods.
[00:28:05.578 --> 00:28:07.900]  Those stolen goods are going to be coming from you, the taxpayer.
[00:28:09.215 --> 00:28:15.398]  And so right now, who is auctioning off getting at your money in the future under these politicians?
[00:28:15.438 --> 00:28:26.684]  Well, for Hillary Clinton, besides those corporations I just mentioned, lobbyists for two major prison companies are now serving as top fundraisers for Hillary Clinton, because that's big business in America.
[00:28:27.344 --> 00:28:29.485]  The prison industrial complex is huge.
[00:28:30.086 --> 00:28:38.832]  Corrections Corporations of America and the GEO Group both see their fortunes turning if there are fewer people to lock up in the future.
[00:28:38.932 --> 00:28:39.812]  No worry about that.
[00:28:39.832 --> 00:28:41.253]  That's from Liberty Blitzkrieg.
[00:28:43.038 --> 00:28:43.698]  No worry about that.
[00:28:43.718 --> 00:28:48.581]  Of course, we have the largest prison population in the world, right?
[00:28:49.021 --> 00:28:58.085]  In terms, any way that you want to measure it, in terms of absolute numbers, in terms of percentage of the people that we have locked up, we have a massive number of people.
[00:28:58.105 --> 00:29:06.969]  And of course, at the root of that, just like at the root of much of our violent crime, much of the concerns about what's happening at the open borders, at the root of that,
[00:29:07.569 --> 00:29:13.776]  Is the war on drugs that nobody wants to talk about because it's now become an accepted way of American life.
[00:29:14.517 --> 00:29:15.358]  Well, I don't accept it.
[00:29:15.618 --> 00:29:16.479]  You shouldn't accept it.
[00:29:16.699 --> 00:29:18.420]  We ought to understand that it is a failure.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.183]  And let's just look at the prison statistics that are coming out.
[00:29:22.203 --> 00:29:24.305]  We got a new study that says the U.S.
[00:29:24.345 --> 00:29:30.010]  prison system is an epic failure and it is a factory for creating criminals.
[00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:31.391]  This is from the Free Thought Project.
[00:29:31.431 --> 00:29:39.257]  They say, a new study from the University of Michigan says that the longer the term served, the higher rate of reconvicted felons.
[00:29:39.297 --> 00:29:41.939]  They say for every year spent in prison, there's a 12.5% increase
[00:29:44.321 --> 00:29:47.843]  And they go on to commit more serious crimes.
[00:29:48.563 --> 00:29:52.845]  Yet, 23% are only actual criminals.
[00:29:53.005 --> 00:29:57.628]  Most of the people, 77%, had no victims that are in our prisons.
[00:29:57.708 --> 00:29:58.128]  Stay with us.
[00:29:58.328 --> 00:29:59.849]  We'll be right back with special reporter Alex Jones.
[00:29:59.869 --> 00:30:00.449]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.509 --> 00:30:02.130]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.051 --> 00:30:05.752]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.784 --> 00:30:15.787]  A group called Concerned Citizens is petitioning an Iowa school district to prevent students from attending a conference on bullying.
[00:30:16.107 --> 00:30:19.109]  The conference was set up by an activist group called Iowa Safe Schools.
[00:30:19.469 --> 00:30:22.751]  It was the content of the conference held in April, which has parents up in arms.
[00:30:22.991 --> 00:30:25.952]  Among the nearly two dozen speakers, only two addressed bullying.
[00:30:26.192 --> 00:30:29.634]  The rest of the sessions involved issues such as how to pleasure their gay partners.
[00:30:29.894 --> 00:30:34.857]  Middle school girls learned how to sew fake testicles into their underwear in order to pass themselves off as boys.
[00:30:35.177 --> 00:30:42.563]  And the featured speaker, drag performer Miss Coco Peru, cursed a lot and encouraged attendees to vandalize the property of LGBT critics.
[00:30:42.983 --> 00:30:48.307]  One parent summed it up like this, it wasn't really on bullying, it was basically a sex ed class for same-sex couples.
[00:30:48.588 --> 00:30:56.034]  Nate Monson, executive director of Iowa Safe Schools, said, in response to the parents, it's incredibly frustrating that adults are being the problem and being the bully.
[00:30:56.174 --> 00:30:57.295]  We can do better in Iowa.
[00:30:57.475 --> 00:31:01.378]  The real plan is to sexualize your kids so more abortions can be performed.
[00:31:01.698 --> 00:31:06.342]  If you want to go deeper into the rabbit hole, check out the video, How Many People Would You Kill For A Million Dollars?
[00:31:06.542 --> 00:31:09.124]  on the Alex Jones Channel and InfoWars.com.
[00:31:09.745 --> 00:31:12.707]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[00:32:39.418 --> 00:32:40.019]  Alex Jones here.
[00:32:40.439 --> 00:32:49.486]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.

[00:33:18.372 --> 00:33:19.353]  You want answers?
[00:33:19.393 --> 00:33:22.434]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:26.575]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.116 --> 00:33:45.063]  In the last few years, basically every day, I have spent many, many minutes, in some cases hours, thinking about one concept
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:34:14.151]  A concept that overall eclipses and basically renders null and void all of the globalist attempts to shutter the minds and the windows of perception of the humans living on the face of this globe.
[00:34:16.983 --> 00:34:28.207]  Everything we see the establishment doing is about narrowing perception and about basically confusing and confounding and dumbing down the people.
[00:34:29.808 --> 00:34:42.593]  And I know all of that goes without saying, but when I talk about this concept, it's important to understand that the concept itself
[00:34:44.042 --> 00:34:56.352]  is about transcending the controlled paradigms or the false maps of the mind that have been created by the globalist social engineers.
[00:34:57.753 --> 00:35:00.996]  And the point I'm making has been made many different times throughout history.
[00:35:01.936 --> 00:35:12.445]  It's just important to note now that with technology and mass media in the last hundred years, there has been a successful move
[00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:26.755]  To actually build a physical cave of Plato, to which the general public can be inserted into, and then dumbed down.
[00:35:27.636 --> 00:35:38.860]  And an example of this is, when the general public sees this little speech I'm giving, a lot of them will make a joke in the YouTube comments that this guy's talking about caves made out of Plato.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.342]  And of course I was talking about Plato and his allegory of the cave.
[00:35:43.775 --> 00:35:49.779]  And whereas we can laugh at those people, we have to understand that they are victims of the cave itself.
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:36:03.468]  And so never before has there been a true pre-matrix or proto-matrix being built to swallow
[00:36:06.235 --> 00:36:10.038]  and restrict human development, human renaissance.
[00:36:11.038 --> 00:36:16.502]  The entire New World Order structure, in their own words, is about overthrowing the renaissance.
[00:36:18.943 --> 00:36:34.634]  It is about taking the printing press of Gutenberg, 500 plus years ago, that empowered the people and caused the greatest spread of technology, information, understanding, literature, poetry, enlightenment, culture,
[00:36:35.663 --> 00:36:42.468]  Music, and inverting that into using media today to destroy minds.
[00:36:42.848 --> 00:36:48.511]  We've never had so much information, so much knowledge at our fingertips, and most people take it for granted.
[00:36:49.832 --> 00:36:59.959]  Most people are so drunk on entertainment, that when real crises happen, or a real woman gets run over out in the street, folks don't go over and help them.
[00:37:01.292 --> 00:37:08.238]  At record levels, people are not rendering aid because their mind basically just sees it as more fiction.
[00:37:08.978 --> 00:37:11.540]  We are a world of spectators.
[00:37:13.562 --> 00:37:19.667]  But the world isn't really a stage and each of us players upon it.
[00:37:20.567 --> 00:37:27.013]  There is an element of fiction, but fiction generally only reflects the hopes and dreams and fears of the people.
[00:37:27.473 --> 00:37:28.614]  It is not the reality.
[00:37:29.369 --> 00:37:33.230]  In advertising, they teach you that perception is reality.
[00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:34.150]  No, it's not.
[00:37:35.031 --> 00:37:52.436]  If a man takes PCP and goes up on top of a 50-story building and believes he's a falcon and jumps off, while he's falling, he may think he's flying, but it only takes 5-10 seconds before he hits the bottom and his consciousness is snuffed out.
[00:37:53.316 --> 00:37:56.577]  So, in truth, perception is not reality.
[00:37:58.035 --> 00:38:06.839]  And the laws of physics and of gravity and the laws of social justice are not suspended just because the establishment wishes they would be.
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.481]  The establishment is threatened by renaissance.
[00:38:10.661 --> 00:38:12.322]  They are threatened by legitimate culture.
[00:38:12.342 --> 00:38:14.323]  That's why they try to dominate it and control it.
[00:38:15.423 --> 00:38:23.207]  And the larger point I'm getting here today is I filled up probably five or six notebooks with points on this whole discussion.
[00:38:25.001 --> 00:38:37.527]  And I've never really done a piece on it because it's so huge and so voluminous and so universal that it's too big a subject to ever, in my view, cover properly.
[00:38:39.088 --> 00:38:40.749]  And in that is the paradox because
[00:38:42.518 --> 00:38:47.341]  You can cover something very short and sweet with poetry or a picture can tell a thousand words.
[00:38:48.021 --> 00:39:02.710]  And so in truth, so many of us taken back who are marveling at consciousness and this incredible universe don't then articulate what we're seeing because we feel like we're not giving it justice and we're humble.
[00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:07.472]  But it's those of us that love beauty, love justice, love truth, love honor.
[00:39:08.032 --> 00:39:15.234]  It's up to us to realize that the evil people, the control freaks, are threatened by the larger universe.
[00:39:15.875 --> 00:39:17.775]  They're not enraptured by it.
[00:39:18.796 --> 00:39:21.997]  They're not brought to their knees by the beauty of it.
[00:39:22.437 --> 00:39:30.060]  They hate it and wish to build their own little universes in which we're forcibly inserted so they can play God.
[00:39:31.198 --> 00:39:34.940]  It's better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven, it was once said.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.340]  Well, I don't agree with that statement.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:40.342]  It's better to be part of heaven than to construct your own hell.
[00:39:41.282 --> 00:39:45.644]  Yes, I could be the king of a closet and imagine that I'm the ruler of the universe.
[00:39:46.525 --> 00:39:47.345]  That's a delusion.
[00:39:48.145 --> 00:39:49.726]  I'm still not really king of anything.
[00:39:50.306 --> 00:39:53.668]  But I could walk out in the wider world and have free association.
[00:39:55.123 --> 00:40:00.064]  And can build things and work with people and share experiences and learn from others.
[00:40:00.104 --> 00:40:01.004]  They can learn from me.
[00:40:01.284 --> 00:40:02.164]  That is communal.
[00:40:02.404 --> 00:40:03.224]  That is kinship.
[00:40:03.464 --> 00:40:05.165]  That is transcendent.
[00:40:07.145 --> 00:40:08.225]  And what I'm getting at is this.
[00:40:09.325 --> 00:40:10.406]  Getting outside the box.
[00:40:10.446 --> 00:40:11.566]  Transcending the globalists.
[00:40:11.606 --> 00:40:12.706]  Realizing what they're doing.
[00:40:13.026 --> 00:40:15.006]  Seeing how big and beautiful the universe is.
[00:40:15.607 --> 00:40:17.587]  Understanding they're not in control.
[00:40:17.827 --> 00:40:18.747]  They only want to be.
[00:40:19.347 --> 00:40:21.788]  Understanding how weak evil is.
[00:40:22.868 --> 00:40:24.208]  Is the key to freedom.
[00:40:25.347 --> 00:40:26.408]  But there are twin keys.
[00:40:26.928 --> 00:40:31.270]  First, you must realize how weak evil is once you've awakened.
[00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:33.651]  But that's really the first key.
[00:40:33.991 --> 00:40:43.955]  You've got to admit that there is bad energy, bad people, corrupt forces in the world that are going to have to be met and faced.
[00:40:45.456 --> 00:40:49.618]  And then only can the journey of human empowerment begin.
[00:40:49.638 --> 00:40:52.399]  And so while I'm in Europe,
[00:40:54.013 --> 00:40:57.855]  Covering what's happening in England, covering what's happening in Spain, in Greece, in Italy.
[00:40:58.215 --> 00:41:02.237]  As they say, Rome is set to collapse in the London Telegraph and other publications.
[00:41:02.898 --> 00:41:19.686]  As I check this out for myself, and you the viewers, and readers, and listeners, we will be reporting on the road about what's currently happening, but also always tying it into context of the wider universe.
[00:41:20.807 --> 00:41:22.388]  The incredible adventure
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:34.608]  That it is to be conscious, that it is to be alive, to be born, to have those experiences, to have friends, to have family, to go through your struggles, to be involved.
[00:41:35.209 --> 00:41:37.450]  Life is all about trailblazing.
[00:41:37.851 --> 00:41:39.252]  It's all about experiences.
[00:41:41.333 --> 00:41:47.318]  But Hollywood and this false culture builds up an image that only superheroes can do great things.
[00:41:48.138 --> 00:41:50.200]  Only Arnold Schwarzenegger can defeat the bad guys.
[00:41:51.582 --> 00:41:54.846]  I mean, it's always one man, or one woman that does it all.
[00:41:55.587 --> 00:42:02.877]  And the truth is, it's all of us together, collectively, doing little things that moves the world.
[00:42:05.465 --> 00:42:30.768]  And it is in that moment of wonder, looking up from the New World Order, looking up from all their propaganda, looking up from all the bizarre things they're distracting us with, and staring out into the heavens, and staring out into the desert night sky, and staring out across the Atlantic Ocean, or the Pacific Ocean, or staring into the eyes of your child, or staring into the eyes of your wife or husband, it is only in that moment that we can pull back
[00:42:31.428 --> 00:42:37.232]  And be separate from the evil that wishes to envelop us and control our free will.
[00:42:38.573 --> 00:42:50.241]  So I have five or six notebooks filled, and they're at the office, they're at my house, they're... I'm always running into another one that I've forgotten I had, where I just try to write down what I think is amazing, what I think is incredible.
[00:42:51.222 --> 00:43:00.589]  And it's just so hard, because once you start thinking about what a miracle everything is, and all the mysteries, it just completely blows you away, and then
[00:43:03.746 --> 00:43:07.109]  You realize what a joke the technocrats are trying to play God.
[00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:09.271]  You realize what a fraud they are.
[00:43:10.772 --> 00:43:12.254]  I think it's important to do a couple things.
[00:43:13.415 --> 00:43:14.175]  This is my view.
[00:43:14.195 --> 00:43:18.119]  You can comment below or make your own videos or call into the show and tell us what you think.
[00:43:18.419 --> 00:43:22.463]  David Knight can comment coming up here on the radio show and TV show what he thinks.
[00:43:23.904 --> 00:43:25.045]  But we've got to be appreciative.
[00:43:25.666 --> 00:43:26.587]  We've got to be thankful.
[00:43:28.148 --> 00:43:28.969]  We've got to be humble.
[00:43:30.191 --> 00:43:33.435]  And we've also got to repent, even if you don't believe in God.
[00:43:33.815 --> 00:43:46.028]  We've got to say sorry to our friends and family, sorry to ourselves, sorry to the universe that we didn't appreciate this more and that we were hateful, we were greedy, we were spoiled, we were petulant.
[00:43:48.111 --> 00:43:50.173]  And with that comes great wisdom.
[00:43:51.391 --> 00:44:01.339]  And again, a lot of what I've said has been said by the ancients, it's been said in modern times, it's been known, but no one who's tuned in can deny that great evil is growing, great darkness is growing.
[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:15.891]  I describe evil as false data, as viruses, as systems of fraud that build false mini-paradigms that disease the universe itself.
[00:44:17.112 --> 00:44:18.794]  It's a false logic, it's a
[00:44:20.515 --> 00:44:48.392]  Twisted view that seeks to overturn the mind because a common mind itself, not even the greatest of minds, is much greater than the mind of those that consciously have some knowledge of reality and choose to use that knowledge not to empower others, but to in dungeon, enslave those because they're threatened by free will.
[00:44:49.218 --> 00:44:50.199]  They're monopoly men.
[00:44:50.219 --> 00:44:56.365]  They just don't want monopoly over healthcare, monopoly over your life or private property, or monopoly over our families.
[00:44:56.785 --> 00:45:00.328]  They want monopoly over free will, over consciousness.
[00:45:01.169 --> 00:45:02.711]  And this system is threatened.
[00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:05.532]  By the beauty that is the free soul.
[00:45:05.952 --> 00:45:08.574]  And that's why we're moving into the age of the machines.
[00:45:09.295 --> 00:45:14.139]  That's why they're moving into the age of saying humans are ugly, defunct, obsolete, and done.
[00:45:14.799 --> 00:45:32.034]  Because to the technocrats, whose souls from inbreeding and corruption and past crimes are so bionic, so cold, so reptile, that to them are burning, flaming, free, hot-blooded souls.
[00:45:33.467 --> 00:45:36.309]  Are like daggers on chalkboards.
[00:45:37.009 --> 00:45:38.270]  They're like a clamor.
[00:45:40.232 --> 00:45:41.793]  To us, sounds like angels.
[00:45:41.853 --> 00:45:42.853]  To them, that is hell.
[00:45:43.734 --> 00:45:45.735]  And so, these two will not mix.
[00:45:46.396 --> 00:45:49.318]  And we've reached the twilight point in civilization.
[00:45:49.738 --> 00:45:52.600]  Is it the dawn of a new system?
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.601]  And a new chance for a future?
[00:45:54.802 --> 00:45:55.982]  Or is it the twilight?
[00:45:56.923 --> 00:45:57.964]  The Guru Dhammaram.
[00:45:58.504 --> 00:45:59.885]  The fall of humanity.
[00:46:00.365 --> 00:46:02.547]  The globalists say the time of man has come to an end.
[00:46:03.826 --> 00:46:07.847]  They say, in the archetype, that the castle will fall.
[00:46:10.548 --> 00:46:13.309]  Because they're so threatened by the fact that it's just begun to rise.
[00:46:13.749 --> 00:46:17.390]  In my heart, in my soul, I know humanity will survive.
[00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:19.210]  It may just be a small part of us.
[00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:21.251]  And it may not even be on this planet.
[00:46:23.171 --> 00:46:24.832]  But our destiny lies in the stars.
[00:46:25.952 --> 00:46:28.873]  Back to the live transmission and more of my live reports from the road.
[00:46:29.565 --> 00:46:35.149]  We now go to David Knight and the Infowarriors News Center that you, the Infowarriors, built.
[00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:39.572]  And again, that's Alex Jones who is in England right now.
[00:46:39.632 --> 00:46:41.513]  He's investigating the globalist takeover of Europe.
[00:46:41.533 --> 00:46:43.734]  He's going to be calling in with a live report later in the show.
[00:46:44.435 --> 00:46:47.277]  And we're also going to be talking to Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:46:47.297 --> 00:46:55.402]  I want to get back to Hillary's prison connection and how that's affecting her campaign, her support.
[00:46:55.862 --> 00:47:05.609]  There's an amazing story, though, that is just coming out of Georgia about a guy getting sued for publishing Georgia laws online.
[00:47:05.669 --> 00:47:06.610]  What does that tell us?
[00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:08.151]  That's just absolutely amazing.
[00:47:08.171 --> 00:47:14.055]  Before I get to that, this hour of the Alex Jones Show, however, is made possible by Survival Shield X2.
[00:47:14.695 --> 00:47:18.478]  It's one of the products that helps to support InfoWars.com.
[00:47:18.798 --> 00:47:23.061]  All the products that we sell at InfoWarsLife.com help to support the operation.
[00:47:23.101 --> 00:47:23.862]  We'd like to give you
[00:47:24.662 --> 00:47:35.931]  Healthy, win-win situation products that will help you with your health, help you to provide for your family in a way that you're not going to get otherwise.
[00:47:36.291 --> 00:47:38.953]  Things like Survival Shield X2, nasoniodine.
[00:47:38.973 --> 00:47:40.894]  It's something I take every day.
[00:47:40.974 --> 00:47:42.996]  It's something I like because it's in a liquid form.
[00:47:43.056 --> 00:47:46.038]  It's very easy for me to take a lot of liquid supplements all at once.
[00:47:47.019 --> 00:47:49.121]  I know that they're very available to me.
[00:47:49.181 --> 00:47:51.462]  It's not something that has to be digested like a pill.
[00:47:52.463 --> 00:47:54.143]  But look for yourself.
[00:47:54.343 --> 00:47:55.664]  Go to Infowarslife.com.
[00:47:55.704 --> 00:47:57.444]  We've got 400 reviews there.
[00:47:57.464 --> 00:48:01.985]  It's a great way to decide what works for you, what works in your life.
[00:48:02.005 --> 00:48:03.145]  You can see some of these reviews.
[00:48:03.185 --> 00:48:03.985]  Here's one of them.
[00:48:04.765 --> 00:48:07.146]  This is from Eileen in Akron, Ohio.
[00:48:07.186 --> 00:48:09.466]  She says, I've been taking X2 for six weeks.
[00:48:09.986 --> 00:48:15.307]  I've lost approximately 20 pounds, have stronger hair and nails, better skin and muscle tone.
[00:48:15.327 --> 00:48:17.408]  I can now walk briskly for two miles.
[00:48:17.808 --> 00:48:19.488]  The last quarter mile, she says, is all uphill.
[00:48:20.188 --> 00:48:21.191]  Hardly breaking a sweat.
[00:48:21.251 --> 00:48:24.058]  I can honestly say I feel better now than I did 20 years ago.
[00:48:24.118 --> 00:48:28.469]  Thanks AJ and Dr. Group for bringing this product to the rest of us.
[00:48:29.502 --> 00:48:31.584]  We have, as I said, over 400 reviews there.
[00:48:31.724 --> 00:48:36.468]  Over 99% of those would recommend it to families and friends.
[00:48:36.709 --> 00:48:39.311]  Again, get your bottle of X2 while it's in stock.
[00:48:39.751 --> 00:48:43.175]  Like all of our products, it goes in and out of stock pretty regularly.
[00:48:43.235 --> 00:48:44.276]  It's in stock right now.
[00:48:44.436 --> 00:48:48.599]  And again, we're very close to the end of free shipping for the month of July.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:53.004]  So stock up on X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:48:54.281 --> 00:48:58.403]  Now, before I go to the story about Georgia, I just want to finish with what I was talking about, of course, of the prisons.
[00:48:58.423 --> 00:49:07.308]  And we've mentioned this many times about how so many people, such a large percentage of people in our prisons are there as non-violent offenders.
[00:49:07.868 --> 00:49:14.212]  People that were put there because we have mandatory minimums that were put in as part of the drug war back in the 1980s by Ronald Reagan.
[00:49:14.252 --> 00:49:17.714]  And, of course, Republicans and Democrats have left that in.
[00:49:18.154 --> 00:49:18.594]  Why is it?
[00:49:19.234 --> 00:49:19.755]  Is it working?
[00:49:20.495 --> 00:49:21.496]  Do we have less drugs?
[00:49:21.896 --> 00:49:23.858]  Do we have less drug cartels?
[00:49:23.878 --> 00:49:25.780]  Do we have less violence and crime?
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.181]  No, we have more.
[00:49:27.802 --> 00:49:28.582]  We have more use.
[00:49:28.883 --> 00:49:29.763]  We have more crime.
[00:49:29.984 --> 00:49:31.004]  We have more corruption.
[00:49:31.365 --> 00:49:42.335]  This is a failed policy unless, unless you understand that this is a wealth transfer from the American taxpayers to these prison corporations.
[00:49:42.695 --> 00:49:44.437]  And as I pointed out in the last segment,
[00:49:45.037 --> 00:49:59.860]  Besides the typical usual suspects like Monsanto, ExxonMobil, Microsoft, the telecom industry, all giving money to Hillary Clinton, now we've got major prison companies bundling millions of dollars for Hillary Clinton.
[00:50:00.834 --> 00:50:07.716]  See, there's $6.9 billion, they say, has been spent on prisons.
[00:50:07.976 --> 00:50:10.577]  And they say this is a growing crisis.
[00:50:10.697 --> 00:50:16.018]  Well, yeah, it's not really a crisis, except for those of us who have to live under it.
[00:50:16.359 --> 00:50:22.120]  For the corporations, for the politicians that these corporations sponsor, it's an opportunity.
[00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:24.421]  It's not a crisis, it's an opportunity.
[00:50:26.038 --> 00:50:30.324]  Understand that, of course, in jail people die from drug overdoses.
[00:50:30.384 --> 00:50:34.149]  I don't believe that Sandra Bland died from an overdose of marijuana.
[00:50:34.189 --> 00:50:35.491]  I don't find that credible at all.
[00:50:35.511 --> 00:50:41.700]  She was there for three days and they say that she hung herself with some plastic baggies because she died of an overdose.
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:45.302]  There are people who go to prison and die of drug overdoses.
[00:50:45.603 --> 00:50:49.205]  There's a report here, 346 inmates die in Florida.
[00:50:49.265 --> 00:50:53.648]  And if you look at those stories, those are not just, those are not drug overdoses.
[00:50:53.788 --> 00:50:58.892]  Most of those are recriminations from the people running the prison.
[00:50:58.952 --> 00:51:00.073]  Stay with us when we come back.
[00:51:00.133 --> 00:51:02.674]  I'm going to get to that story about what's going on in Georgia.
[00:51:02.714 --> 00:51:03.335]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:10.012 --> 00:51:13.795]  In recent years, we have witnessed the most catastrophic disasters in history.
[00:51:14.395 --> 00:51:17.158]  Earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, and more.
[00:51:17.918 --> 00:51:20.220]  Legacy Premium Food Storage will prepare you.

[00:51:36.953 --> 00:51:38.434]  That's survivalfoodalliance.com.

[00:52:39.122 --> 00:52:40.203]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:52:40.363 --> 00:52:44.707]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:52:44.867 --> 00:52:50.431]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:52:50.551 --> 00:52:53.954]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:52:54.114 --> 00:52:56.716]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:52:58.958 --> 00:53:01.680]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:53:10.648 --> 00:53:14.132]  The Electronic Frontier Foundation Privacy Report says it's AT&T.
[00:53:14.392 --> 00:53:19.197]  AT&T customers need to know this when calling the Alex Jones 24-7 listen line at 1-605-562-9000.

[00:54:27.142 --> 00:54:28.704]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:28.744 --> 00:54:36.772]  Yeah, as you hear the theme from the Outer Limits, we really have reached the Outer Limits of cynicism, of corruption, of contempt for the public.
[00:54:36.852 --> 00:54:39.535]  Listen to this story from the state of Georgia.
[00:54:40.115 --> 00:54:45.060]  They're suing a man for publishing Georgia laws on the Internet.
[00:54:46.422 --> 00:54:49.205]  Now, we've gotten kind of used to the government
[00:54:50.134 --> 00:54:51.895]  Producing things like we just saw this last week.
[00:54:51.995 --> 00:54:55.038]  The Dark Act, as activists have pointed out.
[00:54:55.158 --> 00:55:01.803]  The idea that they would shut down any labeling laws that are state or local at the federal level.
[00:55:02.836 --> 00:55:09.601]  Shutting down the idea that we would be allowed to know if there's genetically modified stuff in our food.
[00:55:10.161 --> 00:55:16.806]  There's over 3,000 ingredients that if you put these ingredients in your food, it has to go on the label from the FDA.
[00:55:17.387 --> 00:55:20.749]  But of course, we're not allowed to know about genetically modified foods.
[00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:23.411]  These are things that are constantly changing, unlike these other chemicals.
[00:55:23.451 --> 00:55:31.657]  I mean, they're not constantly changing most of these ingredients, but to say that something is genetically modified, they are constantly
[00:55:32.538 --> 00:55:34.760]  Doing different genetic modifications.
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:37.043]  So, it's something I personally would like to know.
[00:55:37.083 --> 00:55:44.290]  People are free to look at this and disregard it or whatever, but... So, activists have looked at this and said, this is the DARK Act.
[00:55:44.951 --> 00:55:47.774]  You are shutting us out of this information.
[00:55:48.455 --> 00:55:49.776]  You're keeping this information from us.
[00:55:50.076 --> 00:55:55.502]  But of course, Congress calls it, not the DARK Act, they call it the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act.
[00:55:57.105 --> 00:55:57.525]  I think so.
[00:56:13.976 --> 00:56:19.639]  Foreign intelligence surveillance used as a rubber stamp for domestic surveillance.
[00:56:19.679 --> 00:56:27.462]  The FISA Act was set up to specifically prohibit domestic spying and now it's being used as a rubber stamp for domestic spying.
[00:56:27.962 --> 00:56:33.545]  So we see that all the time but now Georgia takes it to new obvious outer limits.
[00:56:33.705 --> 00:56:34.125]  Here we go.
[00:56:34.145 --> 00:56:39.208]  The state of Georgia is suing the owner of publicresource.org
[00:56:41.024 --> 00:56:45.187]  For publishing the state of Georgia's own laws online.
[00:56:45.987 --> 00:56:48.109]  The guy has a website as Carl Malamud.
[00:56:48.609 --> 00:56:53.652]  He has, quote, engaged in an 18-year-long crusade to control the accessibility of U.S.
[00:56:53.692 --> 00:56:57.675]  government documents by becoming the United States public printer.
[00:56:58.235 --> 00:57:01.517]  He argues the law should not be subject to any form of copyright.
[00:57:01.557 --> 00:57:02.558]  Yeah, that's the interesting thing.
[00:57:03.158 --> 00:57:06.180]  That's the angle at which they're coming after him.
[00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:08.482]  They're saying, you're violating our copyright.
[00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:20.278]  I guess when you look at it, I guess they're written by corporations, so I guess the corporations who write our laws should be able to claim copyright on it, right?
[00:57:20.298 --> 00:57:22.079]  Isn't that what ALEC is about?
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.181]  The American Legislative Exchange Council?
[00:57:24.201 --> 00:57:28.305]  I mean, these guys literally, literally write the laws.
[00:57:28.605 --> 00:57:34.691]  They go to these lavish conventions with the legislators from various states, especially from Georgia.
[00:57:35.171 --> 00:57:44.539]  That was one of the ones that figured prominently in a recent report about the corruption, where these corporations write the laws that are going to benefit the corporations.
[00:57:44.599 --> 00:57:47.561]  They fill that out completely, but they just leave a couple of blanks.
[00:57:47.681 --> 00:57:52.305]  One at the top to fill in the name of the state, and another one at the bottom for these guys to all sign on to it.
[00:57:52.325 --> 00:57:56.389]  You know, kind of like the Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic partnerships that they're working on.
[00:57:57.079 --> 00:58:01.843]  So yeah, I guess, you know, maybe they do own the copyright to the laws that the corporations write.
[00:58:02.503 --> 00:58:03.464]  But here's what he says.
[00:58:03.504 --> 00:58:08.728]  He says it's a long-held tenet of American law that there is no copyright in the law.
[00:58:09.269 --> 00:58:12.411]  This is because the law belongs to the people and our system of democracy.
[00:58:12.451 --> 00:58:17.175]  We have a right to read, to know, to speak the laws by which we choose to govern ourselves.
[00:58:17.195 --> 00:58:20.017]  Well, see, the problem is that we're not choosing the laws.
[00:58:20.418 --> 00:58:21.499]  It isn't self-government.
[00:58:22.199 --> 00:58:33.869]  The politicians are not elected, they are selected by the corporations who write these laws, who copyright these laws, who sue you if you even publish the laws because you're not supposed to know.
[00:58:33.969 --> 00:58:42.215]  And of course, as I mentioned earlier, the IRS can go after people 10, 12 times the fines that were in Obamacare.
[00:58:42.456 --> 00:58:43.837]  Just whatever they want to do.
[00:58:43.917 --> 00:58:44.918]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:58:45.338 --> 00:58:48.320]  We're going to start talking about future wars.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:48.821]  Stay with us.
[00:58:51.336 --> 00:58:53.223]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:54.769 --> 00:58:56.957]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:59.796 --> 00:59:04.559]  Alex Jones here with InfoWarsLive.com Consumer Alert Report.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:12.004]  Many of you are aware that around the world, most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[00:59:12.385 --> 00:59:15.007]  Iodine is the good member of the halogen family.
[00:59:15.267 --> 00:59:17.788]  Things like fluoride are the bad halogens.
[00:59:18.229 --> 00:59:25.994]  The good news is, our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:59:26.294 --> 00:59:27.295]  The bad news is,
[00:59:27.595 --> 00:59:37.581]  The supply of these Deep Earth Crystals, that exclusive 999 pure source, is proprietary and only available to Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:37.781 --> 00:59:40.783]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[00:59:41.103 --> 00:59:47.807]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[00:59:48.207 --> 00:59:51.109]  Remember, this iodine stores safely for years.
[00:59:51.649 --> 00:59:54.051]  Available exclusively at Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:54.571 --> 00:59:55.571]  Or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:59:55.892 --> 00:59:58.433]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.782 --> 01:00:16.403]  Big Brother.
[01:00:17.083 --> 01:00:18.084]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:18.845 --> 01:00:19.946]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:20.607 --> 01:00:21.408]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.189 --> 01:00:23.069]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:27.354]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.934 --> 01:00:32.039]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:36.343 --> 01:00:37.764]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:38.875 --> 01:00:45.757]  I am your host today, David Knight, and Alex is going to be joining us later in the program live from England.
[01:00:46.217 --> 01:00:49.798]  He is in Europe investigating the globalist takeover of Europe.
[01:00:49.838 --> 01:00:52.599]  And of course, it's not just Europe that they're going to take over.
[01:00:52.679 --> 01:00:53.379]  They are globalists.
[01:00:53.419 --> 01:00:54.979]  They're taking over everything.
[01:00:55.019 --> 01:00:58.320]  We can see that with the Transatlantic, the Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:02.941]  But specifically, Alex is going to be looking at what's going on in some of those countries there.
[01:01:02.981 --> 01:01:04.222]  So he's going to be joining us live.
[01:01:04.262 --> 01:01:05.422]  We've already had a report from him.
[01:01:05.983 --> 01:01:09.553]  Paul Joseph Watson is also going to be joining us live later in the show.
[01:01:14.949 --> 01:01:19.812]  People in Georgia, they have Alec writing their laws for them in many cases.
[01:01:20.212 --> 01:01:38.945]  This is a corporation, a lobbyist group that has the corporations write the laws for them, they just fill them out, and then if somebody has the audacity to print or to put the laws online, this man is getting sued now by the state of Georgia, saying that they have violated, that he's violated their copyrights.
[01:01:39.997 --> 01:01:46.360]  If you want to know how rampant corporatism is, however, take a look at this article from Free Thought Project.
[01:01:47.518 --> 01:01:56.303]  SCOTUS justices, that's the Supreme Court justices, rule in favor of companies that they own in 90% of the time.
[01:01:57.104 --> 01:02:02.086]  Three Supreme Court justices did not recuse themselves from cases in which they held stock in companies.
[01:02:02.647 --> 01:02:09.150]  Interested in the outcomes, nearly 90% of the time they sided with those businesses that filed friend of the court briefs.
[01:02:09.271 --> 01:02:09.411]  Now,
[01:02:10.271 --> 01:02:14.315]  Understand, we've had Clarence Thomas, who used to be a corporate lawyer for Monsanto.
[01:02:14.915 --> 01:02:22.442]  We have Kagan, who did not recuse herself from Obamacare anytime, even though she was intimately involved in writing the law.
[01:02:22.882 --> 01:02:26.906]  We've got Ginsburg and Sotomayor, who had been gay marriage activists.
[01:02:26.926 --> 01:02:28.187]  They did not recuse themselves.
[01:02:28.247 --> 01:02:29.348]  Why is all this important?
[01:02:30.253 --> 01:02:33.896]  Well, it's important because they're not supposed to have an opinion already.
[01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:37.700]  They're not supposed to be putting their opinions out there like elected representatives.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:42.204]  They're supposed to be concentrating simply on the legal facts.
[01:02:42.965 --> 01:02:44.526]  That's what they're supposed to be deciding on.
[01:02:44.666 --> 01:02:49.490]  They're not supposed to have already picked a side in this or be subjected to this.
[01:02:50.171 --> 01:02:54.234]  But you know, we really have just two branches now of the judiciary.
[01:02:54.754 --> 01:03:02.980]  We've got the Echo Chamber, like this, and we also have the Star Chamber, the FISA Court, as I mentioned in the last segment.
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:05.242]  Of course, the FISA Court is not even really a court.
[01:03:06.003 --> 01:03:08.004]  It's a single judge.
[01:03:08.304 --> 01:03:18.272]  There's no adversarial argument there, there's no jury, and there is no publishing of the results of the finding of the judge.
[01:03:19.301 --> 01:03:23.645]  They maintain in many cases, like the Supreme Court does, that they are modifying our Constitution.
[01:03:24.326 --> 01:03:33.914]  I disagree with that in both cases, but it's even more egregious in the case of the Star Chamber, the FISA Court, because they didn't even tell us what the supposed modifications to the Constitution are.
[01:03:33.954 --> 01:03:38.399]  But in the Supreme Court, what we see over and over again is simply an echo chamber.
[01:03:38.439 --> 01:03:40.521]  Here's a couple of instances.
[01:03:42.526 --> 01:03:43.487]  Corporatism that's there.
[01:03:43.527 --> 01:03:47.089]  Cisco Systems, we have Breyer who had a $100,000 stake in it.
[01:03:47.669 --> 01:03:50.691]  That seemed to affect some of his votes, as I point out.
[01:03:50.751 --> 01:03:56.215]  Roberts with a $15,000 stake in a company called BioSig.
[01:03:56.235 --> 01:03:58.516]  They did not recuse themselves from these cases.
[01:03:58.576 --> 01:04:06.762]  And as I point out, in 90% of the time, 8 out of 9 times they voted for the people that they had financial interests in.
[01:04:07.242 --> 01:04:11.670]  How do you think Hillary Clinton is going to vote when she's given all this money by these big corporations?
[01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:15.336]  Tens of millions, hundreds of millions by the time they get to the election.
[01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:17.731]  Jeb Bush, same way.
[01:04:17.991 --> 01:04:19.592]  All these politicians, the same way.
[01:04:20.153 --> 01:04:24.756]  And of course, now one of those groups is the prison corporations.
[01:04:25.097 --> 01:04:27.919]  The prison industrial complex is getting its hooks into Hillary Clinton.
[01:04:28.559 --> 01:04:38.067]  Maybe that's why you've got these articles like this one from the American Mirror showing that nobody is showing up or pulling off the stakes here for Young Americans for Hillary Party.
[01:04:38.087 --> 01:04:39.208]  This is at a college thing.
[01:04:39.228 --> 01:04:40.129]  You've got a poster here.
[01:04:40.809 --> 01:04:43.890]  Says, young people, you can cut Hillary's swag.
[01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:45.150]  You can get pizza.
[01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:46.910]  You can get political discussion.
[01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:49.831]  Boy, I wonder why nobody's taking them up on that.
[01:04:49.991 --> 01:04:59.073]  Another picture here from campusreform.org showing a college Democrat event where there's only two rows of seats in the entire auditorium.
[01:04:59.293 --> 01:04:59.553]  Yeah.
[01:05:00.073 --> 01:05:07.495]  People are starting to wake up to the phony campaigns of Hillary Clinton, of Jeb Bush, of our political royalties.
[01:05:07.515 --> 01:05:07.935]  Stay with us.
[01:05:08.235 --> 01:05:08.875]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:12.506 --> 01:05:25.231]  To celebrate the birth of our country and give a big thanks to all the Info Warriors out there, we are now offering free shipping on every item shipped out of the InfoWarsStore.com warehouse.
[01:05:25.611 --> 01:05:29.313]  That's free shipping on all t-shirts, books, and DVDs.
[01:05:29.833 --> 01:05:31.774]  Free shipping on Molon Lave and 1776 belt buckles.
[01:05:34.395 --> 01:05:37.478]  Which are also 25% off while supplies last.
[01:05:37.798 --> 01:05:42.402]  Free shipping on all of our InfoWarsLife.com nutraceuticals.
[01:05:42.843 --> 01:05:47.167]  If it's in the InfoWarsStore.com warehouse, it's shipping for free.
[01:05:47.928 --> 01:05:49.689]  All during the month of July.
[01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:59.879]  It's our way of saying thanks to the true heart and soul of this operation, who stand beside us and support us as we wage an InfoWar
[01:06:00.659 --> 01:06:25.793]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[01:06:25.813 --> 01:06:29.535]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[01:06:29.875 --> 01:06:33.540]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.162]  Hdfirearms.com.
[01:06:35.462 --> 01:06:38.666]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs and Special Ops people.
[01:06:38.786 --> 01:06:43.692]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[01:06:43.912 --> 01:06:44.753]  It's always about security.
[01:06:44.753 --> 01:06:45.293]  I think so.
[01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:12.193]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[01:07:12.493 --> 01:07:22.141]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[01:07:22.442 --> 01:07:27.666]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[01:07:27.766 --> 01:07:36.674]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[01:07:36.914 --> 01:07:45.536]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[01:07:45.796 --> 01:07:52.738]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigerex herbal processing technique.
[01:07:52.878 --> 01:07:59.019]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.
[01:07:59.279 --> 01:08:04.063]  If you wish to find deep cleanse and experience the all-in-one cleansing, visit InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:08:04.203 --> 01:08:07.685]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:08:08.186 --> 01:08:14.430]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:17.773]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:24.338 --> 01:08:25.859]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:25.899 --> 01:08:27.480]  I want to get to some good news.
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:31.142]  We have a lot of bad news and we're going to give you some more bad news coming up later in the show.
[01:08:31.162 --> 01:08:32.663]  But let's talk about some good news.
[01:08:32.683 --> 01:08:36.065]  We're going to talk about some vaccine bills that were killed.
[01:08:36.085 --> 01:08:41.049]  We're going to talk about some movements in London to try to open up transparency.
[01:08:41.069 --> 01:08:44.791]  I mean, you've got people in Georgia being sued because they put
[01:08:46.009 --> 01:08:50.033]  Posted Georgia laws are being sued for copyright violations, believe it or not.
[01:08:50.073 --> 01:08:55.658]  I mean, this is coming right on the heels of our Safe and Accurate Labeling Act out of Congress.
[01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:57.400]  Of course, that has not passed.
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:01.503]  When people understand you can still fight this, you need to fight it with your senators.
[01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:03.625]  But it did pass through the House.
[01:09:04.266 --> 01:09:10.311]  A very cynical piece of legislation, basically calling it accurate labeling when they are going to prohibit
[01:09:11.178 --> 01:09:13.880]  Any labeling of GMO in your food.
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:16.922]  They call that Safe and Accurate Labeling Act.
[01:09:17.662 --> 01:09:18.643]  That's how cynical they are.
[01:09:18.663 --> 01:09:21.885]  But we're going to get to some good news here from London, possibly.
[01:09:21.945 --> 01:09:24.747]  I think it's a good idea whether or not it goes through there.
[01:09:24.767 --> 01:09:30.631]  Before we do, just want to let you know that this hour of the Alex Jones Show is made possible by the products that we sell.
[01:09:31.707 --> 01:09:34.769]  At InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:38.112]  This segment is brought to you by clean water.
[01:09:38.252 --> 01:09:40.393]  Clean water that you can get for yourself.
[01:09:40.894 --> 01:09:42.335]  Clean water that you can filter.
[01:09:42.395 --> 01:09:43.716]  You can take the fluoride out.
[01:09:43.776 --> 01:09:45.277]  You can take the glyphosate out.
[01:09:45.717 --> 01:09:48.479]  You can do it for yourself, for your family.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:54.884]  From fluoride to birth control chemicals, we're constantly being bombarded by toxins in our tap water.
[01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:59.707]  That's why Alex and I both use ProPure water filters from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:10:00.788 --> 01:10:04.331]  I wanted to tell you about another special we're giving to listeners that will expire in just four days.
[01:10:04.671 --> 01:10:10.076]  Get the new ProPure water pitcher that filters fluoride for 20% off until the end of June.
[01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:15.260]  While supplies last, this filter can be used for travel and again, it filters fluoride.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:19.524]  You can get that at Infowarsstore.com and get 20% off today.
[01:10:19.564 --> 01:10:26.850]  It's very important to have something that you can take with you for clean water because that's when you're going to really not know what you're getting
[01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:33.875]  Usually, if you're at home and you're on a well, you need something to take out the glyphosate that's probably going to be in the aquifer.
[01:10:34.175 --> 01:10:38.939]  When you're traveling, you want to be able to get the toxins that are put out in the municipal water supplies.
[01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:43.162]  Again, you can get that at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:10:43.262 --> 01:10:47.125]  You can get 20% off of that travel filter, special just for the next four days.
[01:10:48.038 --> 01:10:53.885]  Now, in terms of taking control of our life, okay, some good news on the vaccine front.
[01:10:54.145 --> 01:10:59.531]  Of course, we've got bills all across the country trying to take away our exemptions.
[01:10:59.571 --> 01:11:00.312]  That's what they call it.
[01:11:00.692 --> 01:11:01.273]  Exemptions.
[01:11:01.353 --> 01:11:05.798]  Because, you know, everything nowadays is mandated unless expressly permitted.
[01:11:06.559 --> 01:11:09.945]  See, that's the America of the 20th and 21st century.
[01:11:10.606 --> 01:11:12.650]  It used to be that we lived in a free country.
[01:11:13.111 --> 01:11:17.779]  It used to be everything was permitted unless expressly prohibited.
[01:11:18.646 --> 01:11:20.727]  But now we have turned that upside down.
[01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:22.328]  Agencies like the FDA.
[01:11:22.429 --> 01:11:24.070]  Everything is prohibited.
[01:11:24.130 --> 01:11:32.495]  If you're a terminal patient and you want to try some experimental treatment, that's going to be prohibited to you unless they expressly permit it.
[01:11:32.575 --> 01:11:39.840]  Especially if it's some kind of a treatment that is not being provided by big pharmaceutical companies.
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:43.983]  But when they look at vaccines, they say, well, we're going to give you exemptions.
[01:11:44.003 --> 01:11:46.284]  We'll give you a religious exemption, whatever.
[01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:48.166]  No, we have informed consent.
[01:11:49.148 --> 01:11:54.103]  You need to have our consent before you put stuff in our bodies.
[01:11:54.123 --> 01:11:55.407]  It's just that simple.
[01:11:56.397 --> 01:11:57.738]  That's where I'm drawing the line.
[01:11:57.758 --> 01:11:59.098]  That's where a lot of people are drawing the line.
[01:11:59.118 --> 01:12:04.301]  This is really going to get quite bad if they get serious about trying to enforce this.
[01:12:04.742 --> 01:12:06.983]  Because a lot of us are not going to stand for this.
[01:12:07.843 --> 01:12:10.184]  But, in many places, it's been defeated.
[01:12:10.905 --> 01:12:16.128]  These kind of bills, even though they passed in California, they've been defeated in Texas, they've been defeated now in Mexico.
[01:12:16.148 --> 01:12:25.333]  A bill seeking to take away a parent or guardian's right to religious exemption to keep their children from being forced to receive immunization was just defeated in New Mexico.
[01:12:26.173 --> 01:12:29.515]  Now, of course, they always come for the children first, don't they?
[01:12:29.536 --> 01:12:30.916]  We've got to do it for the children.
[01:12:31.017 --> 01:12:34.719]  We've got to do it for your safety, for security, for national security.
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:37.121]  Except none of these things ever deliver.
[01:12:37.401 --> 01:12:46.687]  And, of course, the approach that they're using all across the country, it isn't as if they have some kind of a legislative agenda that's been created by a pharmaceutical industry, is it?
[01:12:47.088 --> 01:12:54.153]  What we were just talking about with Alex, with ALEC, the American Legislative Exchange Council,
[01:12:55.154 --> 01:12:59.657]  Isn't it funny how this just appeared all of a sudden, all across the country?
[01:13:00.358 --> 01:13:02.680]  It's almost as if somebody's writing our laws, isn't it?
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:15.489]  Like Agenda 21, or like the drug war itself, which was written in detail by the United Nations ten years before Nixon declared the war on drugs and put out the four schedules of drugs.
[01:13:15.509 --> 01:13:19.111]  That was all written down to the letter by the United Nations.
[01:13:19.151 --> 01:13:22.374]  That's why they're jumping in and having fits about
[01:13:23.194 --> 01:13:29.097]  Decriminalization in Colorado and Washington and other places because that's their law.
[01:13:29.797 --> 01:13:31.078]  They think that they own us.
[01:13:31.178 --> 01:13:37.081]  They write these laws and so now we have these mandatory vaccine laws that are being introduced all across the country.
[01:13:37.141 --> 01:13:45.625]  But this particular one would have prohibited parents from opting their children out of allowing the government, this is the way they put it,
[01:13:46.045 --> 01:13:50.910]  Would it prohibit them from opting out of allowing the government to administer immunization shots to their children?
[01:13:51.231 --> 01:13:55.215]  Now this is something in this particular bill that was extremely bad.
[01:13:55.235 --> 01:13:57.718]  It even included homeschool kids.
[01:13:58.178 --> 01:14:00.981]  Even in California, they didn't include homeschool kids.
[01:14:01.041 --> 01:14:04.105]  And that might be one of the reasons that they got away with it.
[01:14:04.445 --> 01:14:06.828]  Don't worry, they're going to come after the homeschool kids next.
[01:14:07.188 --> 01:14:22.960]  And as soon as they got that passed in California, Dr. Pan, the senator who pushed this through, the guy who's a highly paid, who's received a lot of money from guess who, the pharmaceutical industry, he immediately started pushing it in other states, but also saying we now need to move to adults.
[01:14:23.781 --> 01:14:34.208]  And they'll move to particular careers, people who are working in healthcare, people who are working in rest homes, and then it'll just be universal, and if you don't do it, you're going to be
[01:14:35.450 --> 01:14:50.100]  Ostracized into some kind of a ghetto, but of course this has been defeated in New Mexico, and that's a good sign Something else is coming along Something called blockchain if you know anything about Bitcoin, and I don't know a great deal about it So I'm not going to talk a great deal about it
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:53.883]  But at the center of Bitcoin is something called blockchain.
[01:14:54.384 --> 01:14:59.810]  It's a way to audit, it's a way to verify to the authenticity of these exchanges.
[01:15:00.610 --> 01:15:05.776]  And so it's a audit trail, it's transparent, and it's distributed so that everybody can look at it.
[01:15:05.936 --> 01:15:08.137]  But it also provides a level of anonymity.
[01:15:08.157 --> 01:15:14.080]  And so a lot of people have started looking at it and saying, maybe this is going to be, as you see this article here, a new model of governance.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:19.843]  Maybe we could use this to, as another level, to verify that the elections aren't rigged.
[01:15:20.263 --> 01:15:26.326]  Or that the financial transactions in the City of London, for example, aren't rigged.
[01:15:26.386 --> 01:15:27.607]  Because we've seen massive
[01:15:28.067 --> 01:15:28.628]  Scandals there.
[01:15:28.648 --> 01:15:29.929]  Remember the LIBOR exchange?
[01:15:29.949 --> 01:15:31.630]  The London Interbank exchange rates?
[01:15:32.131 --> 01:15:36.154]  The things that set the interest rates for your home, for your car?
[01:15:36.534 --> 01:15:39.997]  If you've got a variable rate interest loan, that's tied to the LIBOR exchange.
[01:15:40.037 --> 01:15:41.298]  They've been manipulating that.
[01:15:41.378 --> 01:15:42.219]  Surprise, surprise.
[01:15:42.699 --> 01:15:44.321]  Just like they manipulate currency.
[01:15:44.641 --> 01:15:46.242]  Just like they manipulate commodities.
[01:15:46.963 --> 01:15:47.824]  They manipulate that.
[01:15:48.184 --> 01:16:04.236]  They even had a little scheme going with some of these things where they were trading it, kind of like if you ever saw the movie The Sting, where they've got that horse race set up and they've got it delayed so they know who the winner is and they place their bets and they give a false tip to somebody.
[01:16:04.796 --> 01:16:06.157]  Basically it was that type of thing.
[01:16:06.778 --> 01:16:07.879]  They had that also running.
[01:16:09.441 --> 01:16:14.705]  We've got a candidate, somebody named George Galloway, who is running for the mayor of London.
[01:16:14.885 --> 01:16:16.966]  This is somebody that we've talked to before.
[01:16:17.006 --> 01:16:19.668]  He's a politician in London.
[01:16:19.708 --> 01:16:23.390]  We talked to him about his investigation into Enron and Ken Lay.
[01:16:24.031 --> 01:16:33.236]  He was of the opinion that Ken Lay was not dead, that he had essentially fled to South America like Hitler was living a secret life there.
[01:16:34.057 --> 01:16:36.619]  He is running in London for mayor.
[01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:48.637]  And he brought in Max Keiser and has an idea about how they might use blockchain to make things more open, more transparent, more honest, to monitor the City of London.
[01:16:48.657 --> 01:16:52.143]  I want to play you a little bit of this on the Street Report about his campaign.
[01:16:52.861 --> 01:16:58.483]  George Galloway, what is your priority when you first, if you are elected, into the mayor's office?
[01:16:58.763 --> 01:17:05.124]  I'm going to send this man into the square mile, into the city of London, to tell them that the party is over.
[01:17:06.125 --> 01:17:10.886]  Often times governments appoint a czar, education czar, crime czar.
[01:17:10.906 --> 01:17:11.766]  I don't have a czar.
[01:17:12.226 --> 01:17:13.087]  I don't like czars.
[01:17:13.787 --> 01:17:14.487]  I have a kaiser.
[01:17:15.227 --> 01:17:25.395]  And his level of financial literacy has already got the city slickers knocking at the knees because they know they can't pull the wool over his eyes.
[01:17:26.316 --> 01:17:35.963]  The second thing I'm going to do is begin a process for the abolition of the City of London special police force which has completely failed to arrest a single banker.
[01:17:36.404 --> 01:17:42.749]  Not a single one has been arrested, convicted of malfeasance on a gigantic scale.
[01:17:43.309 --> 01:17:45.751]  But of course there's a big, big set of issues.
[01:17:46.091 --> 01:17:54.696]  Housing, the housing crisis, the crisis of poverty amongst children, the people crammed like sardines onto baking ovens.
[01:17:54.716 --> 01:18:02.121]  Okay, so he starts to get into some of the local issues there and things that they could do if they weren't getting ripped off by the billions by these crooks there.
[01:18:02.341 --> 01:18:09.925]  Understand that in the city of London, it's about a square mile or whatever, it's where the big financial offices are, they've got their own special police force.
[01:18:09.965 --> 01:18:12.527]  It's kind of a separate jurisdiction there, just like the Vatican.
[01:18:13.027 --> 01:18:15.568]  Just like the Vatican has its own separate police force.
[01:18:15.628 --> 01:18:17.788]  So good luck to him.
[01:18:17.848 --> 01:18:19.549]  I'd like to see them shake that up.
[01:18:19.649 --> 01:18:20.969]  And I thought it was pretty cool.
[01:18:20.989 --> 01:18:22.389]  He said a lot of people have their czars.
[01:18:22.869 --> 01:18:24.010]  I've got my Kaiser.
[01:18:24.810 --> 01:18:25.490]  Max Kaiser.
[01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:26.910]  It's an interesting idea.
[01:18:27.730 --> 01:18:33.792]  I'd like to talk to Max sometime about blockchain and exactly how that works, how that would bring
[01:18:34.492 --> 01:18:40.934]  Transparency, and still keep things somewhat anonymous, how it could be used in monitoring voting, for example.
[01:18:40.954 --> 01:18:42.375]  A lot of people are talking about that.
[01:18:42.395 --> 01:18:45.376]  There's been a slew of articles this last week on that.
[01:18:46.476 --> 01:18:51.558]  Now, of course, this last few days, Obama has been going through Africa.
[01:18:51.578 --> 01:18:56.560]  Remember when Bilderberg said a couple of years ago that they had a special focus on Africa?
[01:18:56.660 --> 01:19:00.281]  I mean, this is part, in my opinion, of neocolonialism.
[01:19:00.361 --> 01:19:02.682]  They're basically sizing the place up.
[01:19:03.502 --> 01:19:13.189]  Seeing who they can get on their side, who they can subvert, and which countries they can go into to confiscate their minerals.
[01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:15.410]  This is neo-colonialism in my opinion.
[01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:18.192]  But of course, it's a tour that Obama is taking.
[01:19:18.992 --> 01:19:29.599]  He went into Kenya, and pull this clip up guys, I want to play this clip where he goes in and he lectures the Kenyan president on gay rights, but this Kenyan president isn't having any of it.
[01:19:29.659 --> 01:19:32.702]  He kind of puts Obama in his place, and I think it's time we do that.
[01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:36.224]  There was an outrageous article that came up yesterday.
[01:19:36.244 --> 01:19:38.786]  It was on the Daily Caller.
[01:19:39.066 --> 01:19:54.717]  Rob Dues was talking about it in the quick one-minute reports that we have about an anti-bullying conference that essentially became an LBGT recruitment aimed at middle school kids.
[01:19:54.817 --> 01:19:57.578]  It's absolutely outrageous what they did.
[01:19:58.459 --> 01:20:03.425]  And of course we had bullying when I was in school, but it wasn't bullying from the LGB crowd.
[01:20:04.165 --> 01:20:08.270]  That's what we're going to talk about when we come back, how Obama was bullying the Kenyan president.
[01:20:11.898 --> 01:20:13.759]  We are a survival company.
[01:20:13.939 --> 01:20:18.122]  We manufacture our own line of level 3 and level 3A body armor.
[01:20:18.302 --> 01:20:21.964]  We proudly make our armor 100% in America.
[01:20:22.184 --> 01:20:24.085]  We have the best prices in the nation.
[01:20:24.285 --> 01:20:27.307]  About $125 cheaper than our nearest competitor.
[01:20:27.547 --> 01:20:28.667]  All lab certified.
[01:20:28.747 --> 01:20:31.029]  For thou art my rock and my fortress.
[01:20:31.149 --> 01:20:31.829]  Psalm 31 3.
[01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:36.512]  We are Fortress Survival LLC dot com.

[01:21:17.897 --> 01:21:25.824]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:21:26.144 --> 01:21:30.805]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:21:44.768 --> 01:21:51.629]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:21:51.809 --> 01:21:56.151]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:22:08.737 --> 01:22:12.179]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:12.981 --> 01:22:13.482]  It's true.
[01:22:13.602 --> 01:22:17.585]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:17.765 --> 01:22:19.587]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:20.147 --> 01:22:24.631]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[01:23:17.888 --> 01:23:23.071]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.
[01:23:23.351 --> 01:23:27.953]  You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.
[01:23:28.253 --> 01:23:31.475]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.

[01:24:10.603 --> 01:24:14.904]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:15.004 --> 01:24:16.525]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[01:24:16.565 --> 01:24:22.426]  You're going to be joined later in the show by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:24:31.853 --> 01:24:43.136]  There's another Mark Dice video where he's talking to liberals, having them sign a petition to impose a 10% male privilege tax.
[01:24:43.156 --> 01:24:48.897]  That's up on the Drudge Report, despite the fact he says that the gender pay gap is a complete myth.
[01:24:49.297 --> 01:24:54.639]  That's an article by Paul Joseph Watson and a video showing that petition from Mark Dice.
[01:24:54.659 --> 01:24:55.579]  We're going to talk about that.
[01:24:56.139 --> 01:24:57.260]  Just like President Obama,
[01:25:21.883 --> 01:25:25.805]  I think we also need to be able to speak frankly about some of these things.
[01:25:25.865 --> 01:25:32.188]  And the fact of the matter is that Kenya, the United States, we share so many values.
[01:25:34.369 --> 01:25:41.793]  Our common love for democracy, entrepreneurship, value for families.
[01:25:43.053 --> 01:25:44.334]  These are things that we share.
[01:25:44.854 --> 01:25:48.216]  But there are some things that we must admit we don't share.
[01:25:49.247 --> 01:25:51.948]  Our culture, our societies don't accept.
[01:25:52.728 --> 01:26:00.391]  It's very difficult for us to be able to impose on people that which they themselves do not accept.
[01:26:01.671 --> 01:26:09.454]  This is why I repeatedly say that for Kenyans today, the issue of gay rights is really a non-issue.
[01:26:09.554 --> 01:26:15.096]  We want to focus on other areas that are day-to-day living for our people.
[01:26:15.953 --> 01:26:19.256]  The health issues that we have discussed with President Obama, these are critical.
[01:26:20.136 --> 01:26:30.404]  Issues of ensuring inclusivity of women, a huge section of society that is normally left out of the mainstream of economic development.
[01:26:31.145 --> 01:26:40.432]  What we can do in terms of infrastructure, what we can do in terms of education, in terms of our roads, in terms of giving our people power, encouraging entrepreneurship.
[01:26:40.853 --> 01:26:42.094]  These are the key focuses.
[01:26:42.494 --> 01:26:43.034]  Maybe once
[01:26:44.068 --> 01:26:46.190]  Like you have overcome some of these challenges.
[01:26:46.230 --> 01:26:47.531]  We can begin to look at new ones.
[01:26:47.972 --> 01:26:56.620]  But as of now, the fact remains that this issue is not really an issue that is on the foremost mind of Kenyans.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:57.561]  And that is a fact.
[01:26:58.752 --> 01:27:02.254]  Yeah, it's not like we have solved all those problems that he mentioned.
[01:27:02.394 --> 01:27:10.079]  Those are all things that are glaring problems, things that government could help, in most cases, by getting out of the way.
[01:27:10.119 --> 01:27:17.264]  Instead, what they're trying to do, in the words of the Kenyan president that you just heard, is impose on people what they do not accept.
[01:27:17.364 --> 01:27:21.707]  And of course, one of the ways that they do this, primarily, is through the schools.
[01:27:22.639 --> 01:27:24.960]  This is what the schools were designed for.
[01:27:25.661 --> 01:27:32.465]  If you go back and you look at the writings of Horace Mann and others, you'll see that that was what they wanted to create the schools for.
[01:27:32.485 --> 01:27:41.391]  They realized that their socialist experiments were not succeeding in the mid-1800s, and they said, well, the problem is that we need to get to the children at an early age.
[01:27:41.951 --> 01:27:46.514]  Every dictator has said this throughout history, going all the way back to Plato's Republic.
[01:27:47.287 --> 01:27:52.411]  Where he basically wanted to destroy the family so that the only loyalty would be to the government.
[01:27:52.751 --> 01:27:54.793]  That would be the way they would control the people.
[01:27:54.833 --> 01:27:57.235]  They would not even know who their parents were.
[01:27:57.715 --> 01:28:00.377]  Perhaps we're pretty close to that today.
[01:28:00.397 --> 01:28:08.884]  When we send our children away to a government institution and have them spend most of their day there, do they really know who their parents are?
[01:28:09.224 --> 01:28:13.107]  Are they more connected to their peers than to their parents?
[01:28:13.427 --> 01:28:18.491]  Do they see the school and the government as the authority figures rather than their parents?
[01:28:19.132 --> 01:28:19.912]  Ask yourself that.
[01:28:20.253 --> 01:28:22.434]  You need to think about that in your personal life.
[01:28:23.075 --> 01:28:24.236]  I know it's a difficult thing.
[01:28:24.296 --> 01:28:25.897]  We have such a high tax burden.
[01:28:26.177 --> 01:28:32.903]  It has driven many people to have both parents, many families, both parents are working, even if you have a two-parent family.
[01:28:33.163 --> 01:28:34.804]  In many families, there's only one parent.
[01:28:35.505 --> 01:28:36.866]  It's extremely difficult.
[01:28:37.657 --> 01:28:48.302]  But I can tell you, if you can work with others, if you can find a way to take control of your children's education, to at least understand what is being taught to them, to know the teachers there...
[01:28:49.082 --> 01:28:51.584]  That, you can't put a price tag on that.
[01:28:51.804 --> 01:29:01.030]  That is going to pay dividends in your life, and quite frankly, it's the only way you and your children and your grandchildren and their children are going to be free.
[01:29:01.150 --> 01:29:05.493]  Take a look at this story that was up on Infowars.com, again, came out yesterday.
[01:29:05.573 --> 01:29:12.538]  At an anti-bullying conference, middle schoolers learn about lesbian sex from the people who are presenting it there.
[01:29:12.598 --> 01:29:13.879]  This is in a small town.
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:15.861]  Only, well, it's less than
[01:29:17.197 --> 01:29:20.660]  5,000 people, 4,690 people in a small Iowa town.
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:29.046]  Among the nearly two dozen speakers who are supposedly going to be there about bullying, only one attendee, only two addressed bullying said one attendee.
[01:29:29.386 --> 01:29:31.127]  The rest of them were selling this.
[01:29:31.567 --> 01:29:37.592]  That's why, that and other things, like Common Core, is why so many people are moving to homeschooling.
[01:29:38.172 --> 01:29:44.897]  There's an article from Common Watch talking about how in Virginia and other places people are concerned that even the private schools
[01:29:45.157 --> 01:29:50.221]  Even the Catholic schools are adopting Common Core because they want to teach to the test.
[01:29:50.661 --> 01:29:52.863]  Don't let them put that kind of pressure on you.
[01:29:53.163 --> 01:29:53.563]  Stay with us.
[01:29:53.583 --> 01:29:58.006]  When we come back, we're going to have a replay of the Black Lives Matter.
[01:29:58.067 --> 01:29:59.548]  That's something that Solange said.
[01:30:00.028 --> 01:30:01.629]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:05.232]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.918 --> 01:30:19.850]  Last week, while on a campaign stop in Iowa, Donald Trump specifically mentioned the video Joe Biggs and Josh Owens shot showing illegal immigrants smuggling drugs into this country.
[01:30:20.111 --> 01:30:24.917]  And over the weekend, he retweeted a message from one of his campaign staffers with a direct link to the video.
[01:30:25.217 --> 01:30:30.663]  Actually, the camera crew, or the reporters, were petrified because they thought they were going to be killed.
[01:30:31.424 --> 01:30:32.946]  Because they're showing this on camera.
[01:30:32.966 --> 01:30:34.507]  The guy's carrying bags of stuff.
[01:30:34.547 --> 01:30:35.068]  It was drugs.
[01:30:35.368 --> 01:30:40.694]  Both Trump and Bernie Sanders are rising in the polls, as these two mavericks seem to be a threat to the establishment.
[01:30:40.814 --> 01:30:47.121]  But as Kurt Nimmo writes, the puppet masters behind the political facade have absolutely no fear of Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders.
[01:30:47.361 --> 01:30:52.404]  Both are part of a traveling sideshow on the road to the primaries in the November 2016 presidential election.
[01:30:52.644 --> 01:30:59.489]  Bush or Clinton will sit in the White House come January 2017, and everything between now and then is little more than pure political theater.
[01:31:00.329 --> 01:31:06.853]  You can read more in the article, Forget Trump and Bernie, Here's Why Clinton or Bush Will Be the Next President, on InfoWars.com.
[01:31:07.173 --> 01:31:07.954]  Rob Due reporting.
[01:31:09.571 --> 01:31:12.794]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:13.094 --> 01:31:21.100]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:21.341 --> 01:31:26.365]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:31:26.745 --> 01:31:29.047]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:32:12.662 --> 01:32:22.304]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[01:33:06.295 --> 01:33:19.282]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:30.536 --> 01:33:34.298]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight.
[01:33:34.619 --> 01:33:42.023]  It was less than a week ago that Salon came out with an article titled, conspiracy theorists have hijacked the GOP.
[01:33:42.704 --> 01:33:47.326]  What happens when Trump, Cruz and Carson start following Alex Jones' lead?
[01:33:47.927 --> 01:33:49.067]  What are they so upset about?
[01:33:49.107 --> 01:33:54.511]  Well, they say the GOP every day is continuing to follow the very fringes of political discourse
[01:33:55.131 --> 01:34:01.493]  Sounding eerily similar to the paleo-conservative conspiracy theorists like radio host Alex Jones.
[01:34:01.973 --> 01:34:06.214]  And specifically, they're talking about this rally that was held back in May.
[01:34:06.574 --> 01:34:08.615]  The rally that we went to in Austin.
[01:34:09.495 --> 01:34:16.837]  Taking the hashtag Black Lives Matter and pointing out the racist, genocidal history of Planned Parenthood.
[01:34:17.217 --> 01:34:21.298]  A history that Salon spends the rest of the article trying to deny exists.
[01:34:21.578 --> 01:34:23.959]  Yes, Black Lives Matter, all lives matter.
[01:34:24.679 --> 01:34:31.662]  Planned Parenthood has focused primarily on black lives and taking black lives from the very beginning.
[01:34:31.702 --> 01:34:35.524]  Here's that report again, just so Salon knows where we're coming from.
[01:34:35.544 --> 01:34:46.309]  On this Monday, the 27th day of July 2015, I want to look back
[01:34:55.285 --> 01:35:12.440]  A couple months ago, to what happened on May 21st, when myself, Jakari Jackson, and others simply tried to go down to the Planned Parenthood here in Austin, Texas, and point out that all black lives matter.
[01:35:13.681 --> 01:35:20.507]  That was an idea that Reverend Childress in New Jersey had already had for months, had already been doing.
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:28.506]  With great success and that we weren't even aware of, Mikhail Thelin had the similar idea.
[01:35:28.666 --> 01:35:29.687]  Great minds think alike.
[01:35:30.347 --> 01:35:31.828]  Necessity is the mother of invention.
[01:35:32.569 --> 01:35:47.101]  If we're going to have race war over a hundred or so innocent black people that may get shot a year, that's a terrible number, that's a high number too, but let's just say it's over a hundred, then shouldn't we worry about the millions of blacks
[01:35:48.371 --> 01:35:56.756]  It's over 18 million that have been killed since Roe v. Wade 42 years ago in 1973, which is there to target blacks.
[01:35:57.697 --> 01:36:09.244]  So we go out there and these demons just show up of all races, clad in black, to announce how they love Satan and love death and love dead babies.
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:26.183]  Now I've told you that years ago, I was involved quite a bit, and folks that watch me on AXS TV 18, 19 years ago, you know, saw these reports, that I would go out and demonstrate and also cover others that were demonstrating at abortuaries just to draw attention to it.
[01:36:27.104 --> 01:36:34.285]  And not out of some goody-two-shoes angle or something, I understand you dehumanize babies, then it's old people, then it's veterans, then it's everybody.
[01:36:35.445 --> 01:36:38.326]  Euthanasia, you know, kill grandma, the whole nine yards.
[01:36:39.989 --> 01:36:42.591]  And I'm not some hypocrite on a high horse here.
[01:36:42.911 --> 01:36:45.772]  I've had girlfriends in high school and college that had abortions.
[01:36:45.913 --> 01:36:47.634]  And I repent for that.
[01:36:48.334 --> 01:36:49.995]  And not even from a religious perspective.
[01:36:50.855 --> 01:36:54.077]  I repent for devaluing human life.
[01:36:54.278 --> 01:36:57.499]  By the way, I wasn't for the abortions, but I didn't fight too hard to stop them.
[01:36:59.741 --> 01:37:01.682]  And my activity led to that happening.
[01:37:01.722 --> 01:37:03.083]  So let me just get that out there in the open.
[01:37:03.703 --> 01:37:05.264]  I'm not judging people that have had abortions.
[01:37:05.284 --> 01:37:06.064]  You were lied to.
[01:37:06.545 --> 01:37:08.306]  You were manipulated.
[01:37:10.003 --> 01:37:14.246]  Just understand, it's about eugenics, it's about lowering human life, and something I've told people for years.
[01:37:14.366 --> 01:37:20.750]  China comes and grabs women, does a cesarean, waits until they're eight, nine months pregnant, keeps the baby alive.
[01:37:20.830 --> 01:37:22.931]  This is really secretive stuff, but it's leaked.
[01:37:23.531 --> 01:37:27.774]  And then kills the baby, and then folks fly their kids into Japan.
[01:37:28.314 --> 01:37:33.758]  They fly the organs into Japan right after they're removed, sometimes in a mobile van.
[01:37:34.833 --> 01:37:35.996]  Also prisoners as well.
[01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:41.348]  And then you get the quote fresh organs is the Chinese translation from some of the brochures.
[01:37:41.970 --> 01:37:44.055]  Well Planned Parenthood here domestically.
[01:37:44.821 --> 01:37:52.503]  Is getting corneas, is getting livers, is getting lungs, heart, kidneys.
[01:37:52.903 --> 01:37:54.924]  You can get 100, 200 grand per kidney.
[01:37:55.084 --> 01:37:57.765]  You can get 300 grand for a heart, 300 grand for a liver.
[01:37:58.545 --> 01:38:00.385]  And then these are put in people's sick children.
[01:38:01.006 --> 01:38:06.407]  But the point is, you pay 300 to 400 bucks for an abortion, maybe more for a partial birth.
[01:38:07.007 --> 01:38:12.449]  And you know, here's this woman a few weeks ago, famously the director of medical services
[01:38:13.804 --> 01:38:25.549]  For Planned Parenthood, a high-level person that works for the Obama administration, official as well, just bragging, drinking wine, you know, we get a lot of money for these baby parts, and we don't want folks to know about that while she slurps wine.
[01:38:26.009 --> 01:38:28.250]  And of course, there's another angle to this.
[01:38:28.510 --> 01:38:36.753]  In a sick way, and I'm not endorsing abortion, at least some life is coming out of the kids that are being killed, in that their organs are being sold.
[01:38:38.021 --> 01:38:40.802]  But do you really want a baby to die so that you can live?
[01:38:40.962 --> 01:38:41.542]  Maybe you do.
[01:38:41.623 --> 01:38:48.405]  But regardless, folks having abortions need to know you should be being paid, not the other way around.
[01:38:49.186 --> 01:38:51.767]  But that's how these wicked operations operate.
[01:38:52.327 --> 01:38:55.308]  Of course you're getting screwed when you kill your baby.
[01:38:55.388 --> 01:38:56.589]  So think about it.
[01:38:56.689 --> 01:38:57.329]  Think twice.
[01:38:58.670 --> 01:39:02.531]  And or for God's sakes, use contraception and don't get pregnant.
[01:39:02.811 --> 01:39:05.012]  Don't use abortion as birth control.
[01:39:05.332 --> 01:39:06.753]  I think that's what I'm trying to get at here.
[01:39:08.018 --> 01:39:16.822]  When I would go demonstrate against abortion clinics many years ago, people would walk up and say, I'm gonna kill you, I love Satan, who wants these black people?
[01:39:16.862 --> 01:39:18.043]  We gotta get rid of these weeds.
[01:39:18.403 --> 01:39:20.044]  Margaret Sanger, of course, said that on record.
[01:39:20.884 --> 01:39:28.068]  And then I just watch them as this paragon of liberal lovey-dovey-ness, and they're the best people in the world, and they're so good.
[01:39:28.528 --> 01:39:35.752]  Just know that they're getting hundreds of thousands of dollars, conservatively,
[01:39:37.128 --> 01:39:40.529]  As the middleman selling these organs.
[01:39:40.589 --> 01:39:44.030]  And she's talking about how to chop them up and keep the torso intact.
[01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:46.530]  Because you can't tell the woman, hey, we're doing a cesarean.
[01:39:47.571 --> 01:39:48.931]  Don't look at this baby.
[01:39:48.951 --> 01:39:51.732]  We're going to take it over here to then harvest it properly.
[01:39:52.412 --> 01:39:54.052]  You've got to cut the ventricles.
[01:39:54.072 --> 01:39:55.973]  You've got to cut the arteries of the heart.
[01:39:56.013 --> 01:39:58.613]  You've got to get the kidneys right so they're deliverable.
[01:39:59.334 --> 01:40:04.415]  So there they are trying, because it'd be better for the woman to chop the baby up in small parts, in the uterus.
[01:40:05.777 --> 01:40:21.101]  Once the baby's gotten larger, late second or third trimester, they're in there, I hate to talk about this, but it's just a fact, not even properly butchering the child, with big old forceps ripping it out of you, in an attempt to keep it intact to get those organs.
[01:40:21.901 --> 01:40:23.522]  And I mean, look, this could be a new business!
[01:40:25.009 --> 01:40:31.193]  For these people that love Satan and death and all this, they're there paying for abortions to be part of the Holy Sacrament of Satan.
[01:40:32.174 --> 01:40:33.795]  Why not get paid?
[01:40:34.195 --> 01:40:47.664]  And then women can just, like a chicken farm, or whatever, you know, instead of a chicken being tortured in a little cage, you just, you know, have the baby right there, and then you go in and you can get bids on who's going to pay you the most for your baby parts, for your blood type and stuff.
[01:40:48.084 --> 01:40:49.365]  So it's a new business opportunity.
[01:40:49.385 --> 01:40:50.686]  And I'm not being cynical here.
[01:40:50.706 --> 01:40:51.927]  This is not dark satire.
[01:40:51.947 --> 01:40:52.407]  I'm serious.
[01:40:52.767 --> 01:40:53.508]  You Satanists
[01:40:54.656 --> 01:41:00.842]  Are going to get greedy, I believe, once you realize this is going on and want the money that you can get.
[01:41:00.862 --> 01:41:07.609]  So you're going to try to go find women you can get to get pregnant, as Satanists do, to then, you know, obviously have children to be sacrificed.
[01:41:07.629 --> 01:41:09.631]  That's what real Satanists do.
[01:41:09.651 --> 01:41:17.399]  And they're going to go out and, you know, basically start demanding in the market that you get hundreds of thousands of your fair share of the organ money.
[01:41:18.424 --> 01:41:23.907]  And that that might actually bring out the fact that this is really a macabre exercise in evil.
[01:41:24.587 --> 01:41:32.652]  I think these little wannabe communist kids are just trying to be shocking and are attracted to evil like a moth is to flame.
[01:41:33.672 --> 01:41:38.214]  But the higher-ups at Planned Parenthood and others are truly demonic and evil.
[01:41:38.475 --> 01:41:39.655]  So that's the bottom line.
[01:41:40.015 --> 01:41:44.218]  Orphan harvesting, trafficking, and you notice no mainstream media has covered this.
[01:41:45.098 --> 01:41:49.281]  Other than to whitewash it and to say it's isolated, no big deal.
[01:41:49.621 --> 01:41:52.583]  So here is that report on this Monday transmission.
[01:41:52.883 --> 01:41:53.944]  Then we're going to David Knight.
[01:41:54.504 --> 01:41:56.766]  Alex Jones assaulted by rabid communists.
[01:41:56.786 --> 01:41:57.166]  Here it is.
[01:42:24.351 --> 01:42:25.172]  Hey!
[01:42:25.992 --> 01:42:26.112]  Hey!
[01:42:26.152 --> 01:42:26.332]  Hey!
[01:42:27.133 --> 01:42:29.234]  Get the f**k over here!
[01:42:29.374 --> 01:42:29.955]  Find us!
[01:42:30.475 --> 01:42:31.275]  Scuse us!
[01:42:31.476 --> 01:42:31.736]  Find us!
[01:42:31.936 --> 01:42:34.097]  Oh, you gotta chill, bro!
[01:42:34.537 --> 01:42:34.958]  Yo, stop!
[01:42:34.978 --> 01:42:37.059]  Your boy is attacking me!
[01:42:37.099 --> 01:42:38.680]  Watch out, watch out!
[01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:39.460]  Clowns!
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:39.921]  Watch out!
[01:42:39.941 --> 01:42:40.781]  Grab the mic again!
[01:42:40.861 --> 01:42:42.102]  Look at these clowns!
[01:42:42.122 --> 01:42:43.483]  Get the cops!
[01:42:43.503 --> 01:42:44.103]  Get the cops!
[01:42:51.164 --> 01:42:52.927]  Why are you so worried about a f****** zyko?
[01:42:53.407 --> 01:42:55.850]  Ultimately, your sympathies do not lie with black people.
[01:42:55.870 --> 01:43:01.297]  They lie with your racist, white, middle-class agenda, and that's where it will always lie, and you will be destroyed holding that line.
[01:43:01.497 --> 01:43:03.800]  Okay, I adopted two children.
[01:43:04.001 --> 01:43:05.583]  Oh, good for you, white savior!
[01:43:05.643 --> 01:43:06.364]  Aren't you so proud?
[01:43:06.384 --> 01:43:06.884]  You're f****** white.
[01:43:06.904 --> 01:43:07.625]  They're not white.
[01:43:09.709 --> 01:43:11.050]  Exactly, he's not white.
[01:43:11.110 --> 01:43:12.590]  Exactly, you're a white savior.
[01:43:12.630 --> 01:43:16.411]  You think that it is the white man's duty to fix everybody's problems, right?
[01:43:16.431 --> 01:43:17.752]  How many did you adopt?
[01:43:18.592 --> 01:43:19.693]  How many did I adopt?
[01:43:19.853 --> 01:43:20.753]  I kill my kids.
[01:43:22.153 --> 01:43:23.394]  How many did I adopt?
[01:43:23.554 --> 01:43:24.454]  I kill my kids.
[01:43:25.634 --> 01:43:26.975]  I kill my kids.
[01:43:31.132 --> 01:43:32.613]  I pay all my money for that.
[01:43:32.814 --> 01:43:37.357]  I get free abortions on demand without apology.
[01:43:37.537 --> 01:43:38.738]  And I'm going to hell.
[01:43:39.059 --> 01:43:40.660]  Yeah, I still pay to kill babies, though.
[01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:40.980]  Really?
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:41.621]  Oh, yeah.
[01:43:42.021 --> 01:43:44.883]  How do you get your abortions paid for?
[01:43:44.903 --> 01:43:45.484]  I pay for them.
[01:43:46.044 --> 01:43:46.265]  Really?
[01:43:46.325 --> 01:43:48.646]  How many do you pay for them?
[01:43:48.807 --> 01:43:49.227]  Upwards of 50.
[01:43:49.287 --> 01:43:50.208]  Really?
[01:43:50.388 --> 01:43:51.649]  Oh, yeah.
[01:43:51.709 --> 01:43:54.371]  I raise money from the community for it.
[01:43:54.391 --> 01:43:55.392]  Oh, you don't use your money?
[01:43:56.479 --> 01:43:57.940]  You multiply your efforts, huh?
[01:43:58.220 --> 01:44:13.252]  Well, we're down here pointing out that all black lives matter, all lives matter, and that the very people who want to literally wipe out black Americans through Planned Parenthood on record are the ones trying to create this whole race war and garbage off some of these tragedies.
[01:44:13.272 --> 01:44:17.375]  So we're pointing out the real organized genocide with the documented proof.
[01:44:17.595 --> 01:44:18.796]  We're talking to a lot of great folks.
[01:44:19.056 --> 01:44:20.357]  Sir, give us your take on all this.
[01:44:20.737 --> 01:44:25.180]  Yeah, I think that we're going to continue forward as a country and we need to
[01:44:26.315 --> 01:44:28.316]  Excuse us!
[01:44:28.516 --> 01:44:29.677]  Fine us!
[01:44:30.037 --> 01:44:31.257]  Excuse us!
[01:44:31.417 --> 01:44:32.458]  Fine us!
[01:44:32.738 --> 01:44:33.639]  Excuse us!
[01:44:33.879 --> 01:44:34.059]  Chill!
[01:44:34.099 --> 01:44:34.299]  Chill!
[01:44:34.339 --> 01:44:34.559]  Chill!
[01:44:34.679 --> 01:44:34.919]  Chill!
[01:44:34.959 --> 01:44:35.459]  Chill!
[01:44:35.499 --> 01:44:36.060]  Chill!
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:36.960]  Chill!
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:37.240]  Chill!
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:37.740]  Chill!
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:40.962]  Alright, we're just assaulted.
[01:44:40.982 --> 01:44:41.522]  Get the cops.
[01:44:41.982 --> 01:44:42.463]  Get the cops.
[01:44:42.483 --> 01:44:43.563]  That guy's got the witness.
[01:44:43.623 --> 01:44:46.364]  He's coming at me again right now.
[01:44:46.404 --> 01:44:48.726]  Go ahead and touch me one more time.
[01:44:48.786 --> 01:44:49.286]  Go ahead.
[01:44:49.386 --> 01:44:49.986]  He touched me.
[01:44:54.469 --> 01:44:56.090]  Move away from the street, man.
[01:44:56.251 --> 01:44:57.432]  You're gonna get hurt.
[01:44:57.472 --> 01:44:58.673]  Move away from the street.
[01:44:58.713 --> 01:45:00.994]  Bro, you gotta chill, bro!
[01:45:01.055 --> 01:45:01.455]  Yo, stop!
[01:45:01.515 --> 01:45:03.917]  Yo boy is attacking me!
[01:45:03.997 --> 01:45:07.139]  Get the hell out of here!
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:08.941]  Your God's fallen!
[01:45:09.001 --> 01:45:11.243]  We had you guys on video.
[01:45:11.343 --> 01:45:13.204]  Your God's fallen!
[01:45:22.128 --> 01:45:22.629]  You're weak!
[01:45:22.889 --> 01:45:23.569]  Your God's weak!
[01:45:48.328 --> 01:45:57.358]  We're trying to get these guys out of their parking lot.
[01:45:57.378 --> 01:45:59.620]  We're trying to get out of your parking lot.
[01:46:04.918 --> 01:46:05.999]  Hey brother, we just got assaulted.
[01:46:06.019 --> 01:46:07.500]  We're just getting into habit.
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:09.101]  Alright, here you go.
[01:46:09.441 --> 01:46:11.383]  People ask me why I'm a Christian, why I talk about God.
[01:46:11.523 --> 01:46:12.604]  I don't mean these fake churches.
[01:46:12.824 --> 01:46:14.685]  I face the new world order over and over again.
[01:46:14.705 --> 01:46:17.147]  They're all devil worshipers!
[01:46:17.247 --> 01:46:19.228]  We know who they are, and we're sick of them!
[01:46:19.268 --> 01:46:20.249]  And you've been ousted!
[01:46:20.609 --> 01:46:22.711]  We see you hurting children, you filth!
[01:46:22.791 --> 01:46:23.511]  We see you!
[01:46:24.031 --> 01:46:25.873]  We see you, and humanity's rising.
[01:46:26.253 --> 01:46:28.775]  You sit on him, pick us, and tell us to submit.
[01:46:28.955 --> 01:46:30.156]  We'll never submit to you!
[01:46:30.176 --> 01:46:31.597]  And humanity's rising!
[01:46:32.699 --> 01:46:38.521]  She was the founder of the American Birth Control League and the publisher of its newsletter, The Birth Control Review.
[01:46:39.721 --> 01:46:46.863]  On a practical level, the relationship between Sanger and these elitists was basically a marriage of convenience.
[01:46:47.544 --> 01:46:53.826]  The result was that the American Birth Control League became the driving force behind the American eugenics movement.
[01:46:54.746 --> 01:46:57.327]  Eugenics would no longer just be a philosophy.
[01:46:58.247 --> 01:47:01.168]  Sanger and others like her were going to put it into practice.
[01:47:02.577 --> 01:47:12.208]  We are paying for and even submitting to the dictates of an ever increasing, unceasingly spawning class of human beings who never should have been born at all.
[01:47:13.009 --> 01:47:13.769]  Margaret Sanger, 1922.
[01:47:17.049 --> 01:47:19.312]  And you're not Stalin supporters?
[01:47:19.352 --> 01:47:20.073]  No, I'm not!
[01:47:20.113 --> 01:47:21.494]  I'm a f***ing anarchist, sir!
[01:47:21.534 --> 01:47:25.919]  Hold on, so there's not a Facebook with you saying you love Stalin?
[01:47:25.939 --> 01:47:26.760]  Get the f*** off of me!
[01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:27.100]  Go away!
[01:47:39.014 --> 01:47:42.997]  How many did I adopt?
[01:47:43.177 --> 01:47:44.077]  I kill my kids!
[01:47:45.158 --> 01:47:47.620]  Ultimately, your sympathies do not lie with black people.
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:53.064]  They lie with your racist, white, middle-class agenda, and that's where we'll always lie, and you will be destroyed holding that line.
[01:47:53.505 --> 01:47:55.086]  You own that label!
[01:47:55.126 --> 01:47:56.827]  You are misogynist!
[01:47:57.568 --> 01:48:01.491]  You are misogynist!
[01:48:01.711 --> 01:48:07.215]  Wait a minute, you marching a Black Lives Matter thing with a hammer and sickle?
[01:48:07.395 --> 01:48:07.896]  Is that you?
[01:48:09.774 --> 01:48:10.535]  We're just asking.
[01:48:10.555 --> 01:48:11.575]  We're just asking.
[01:48:11.755 --> 01:48:12.876]  That's from Facebook.
[01:48:12.896 --> 01:48:14.557]  That's really impressive.
[01:48:14.617 --> 01:48:16.258]  Hey man, it says lizard people.
[01:48:16.338 --> 01:48:18.939]  I've never met an alien before.
[01:48:18.999 --> 01:48:19.820]  What's it like?
[01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:20.620]  Which planet?
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:21.741]  What do they sound like?
[01:48:21.941 --> 01:48:22.722]  Yeah, it is.
[01:48:29.839 --> 01:48:32.380]  Anyways, do you have any language skills other than cuss words?
[01:48:33.780 --> 01:48:38.221]  More pathetic than Gollum.
[01:48:38.361 --> 01:48:40.462]  More pathetic than Gollum.
[01:48:40.482 --> 01:48:41.542]  The Lord of the Rings?
[01:48:41.622 --> 01:48:42.003]  Yeah.
[01:48:42.023 --> 01:48:42.923]  You don't want to talk?
[01:48:42.943 --> 01:48:43.603]  Not to you.
[01:48:43.843 --> 01:48:47.064]  You just want to block everybody else's microphones?
[01:48:47.084 --> 01:48:48.684]  I don't want to talk to you.
[01:48:49.305 --> 01:48:50.925]  Why the f*** would I want to talk to you?
[01:48:50.965 --> 01:48:53.986]  You sure came out here and you sure made fools of yourself, so thank you.
[01:48:56.701 --> 01:49:07.232]  And again, that was the Marxists at the Planned Parenthood counter-demonstrating, as we try to point out that all lives matter, especially black lives, that Margaret Sanger and her organization specifically targeted.
[01:49:07.472 --> 01:49:13.579]  We're going to have Abby Johnson, who was a Planned Parenthood Employee of the Year back in 2009, just before she quit.
[01:49:14.210 --> 01:49:16.011]  Why did she quit and become a whistleblower?
[01:49:16.712 --> 01:49:20.294]  She saw an ultrasound procedure against a baby.
[01:49:20.774 --> 01:49:26.797]  She was told, oh, at this stage they can't feel any pain, and yet she saw this baby withdrawing in pain.
[01:49:26.817 --> 01:49:30.960]  We're going to talk to her about her experiences with Planned Parenthood.
[01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:34.802]  We're also going to talk to her about the recent revelations.
[01:49:35.922 --> 01:49:38.245]  About the selling of baby body parts.
[01:49:38.805 --> 01:49:40.427]  She's going to be in studio with us tomorrow.
[01:49:41.388 --> 01:49:50.278]  If you want to know, if you want to learn about this racist, eugenicist, depopulation agenda, a great way to do it is become a Prison Planet TV subscriber.
[01:49:50.779 --> 01:49:51.500]  Your subscription.
[01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:56.442]  At $5.95 a month or at a discount $54.95 for a year.
[01:49:56.903 --> 01:49:59.524]  Gives you access to the nightly news each night as it happens.
[01:49:59.544 --> 01:50:05.167]  You have full access to all the archives, the radio program, as well as all of Alex Jones' documentaries.
[01:50:05.947 --> 01:50:09.549]  That works out, if you get an annual membership, that works out to just 15 cents a day.
[01:50:10.269 --> 01:50:15.912]  It hardly supports our bandwidth, but it is a great way to support us to get that information out there.
[01:50:15.932 --> 01:50:21.316]  We make it available because we want you to use that information, the documentaries and other things to wake people up.
[01:50:21.356 --> 01:50:24.678]  You can share that with 20 people each night.
[01:50:24.718 --> 01:50:26.058]  You can all watch the nightly news.
[01:50:26.098 --> 01:50:28.400]  You can have access to Alex Jones's documentaries.
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:34.165]  And before we go to break, I just want to let you know again about the ProPure filter that just has four days left on it.
[01:50:34.605 --> 01:50:41.070]  Again, that's the ProPure water filter that filters fluoride for 20% off until the end of June while supplies last.
[01:50:41.511 --> 01:50:42.812]  That's the portable filter.
[01:50:42.852 --> 01:50:45.954]  You can see that at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:50:46.875 --> 01:50:50.837]  When we come back, we're going to take another look at the immigration issue.
[01:50:51.017 --> 01:50:52.158]  New California.
[01:50:52.738 --> 01:50:55.820]  Mass immigration is turning Virginia blue.
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:58.402]  We're going to talk about where those people are coming from.
[01:50:58.462 --> 01:50:59.682]  You might be surprised.
[01:51:00.102 --> 01:51:01.863]  Most of them are not coming from Mexico.
[01:51:01.944 --> 01:51:02.524]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:10.162 --> 01:51:14.227]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:14.267 --> 01:51:17.271]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:17.451 --> 01:51:18.793]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:19.093 --> 01:51:22.137]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:22.437 --> 01:51:23.378]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:51:23.939 --> 01:51:25.061]  Just won't quit.
[01:51:25.743 --> 01:51:27.846]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[01:51:28.086 --> 01:51:32.631]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?

[01:51:41.124 --> 01:51:41.904]  This is Dan Pilla.
[01:51:41.924 --> 01:51:43.425]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:51:43.725 --> 01:51:45.005]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:45.386 --> 01:51:47.706]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:48.207 --> 01:51:50.047]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:50.487 --> 01:51:54.549]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:51:55.009 --> 01:51:58.710]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:51:58.950 --> 01:52:02.391]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[01:52:02.712 --> 01:52:03.112]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:52:03.132 --> 01:52:04.772]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:52:10.208 --> 01:52:13.690]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:52:14.430 --> 01:52:14.931]  It's true.
[01:52:15.051 --> 01:52:18.993]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:52:19.193 --> 01:52:21.034]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:52:21.594 --> 01:52:26.057]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:52:26.377 --> 01:52:38.995]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[01:52:39.256 --> 01:52:42.761]  Big Berkey Water Filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[01:52:43.041 --> 01:52:45.342]  The gold standard in water purification.
[01:52:45.702 --> 01:52:49.724]  And our filters last for years at less than two cents per gallon.
[01:52:50.004 --> 01:52:50.624]  Big Berkey.
[01:52:50.824 --> 01:52:54.325]  The one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[01:52:54.525 --> 01:52:56.146]  Get your Big Berkey today.
[01:52:56.286 --> 01:52:58.587]  Call 1-877-99-BERKEY or click BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:52:58.647 --> 01:52:59.287]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:52:59.407 --> 01:53:00.668]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[01:53:00.728 --> 01:53:01.788]  For the love of clean water.
[01:53:09.887 --> 01:53:16.109]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:53:16.569 --> 01:53:24.351]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:53:24.691 --> 01:53:32.513]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:53:32.853 --> 01:53:37.594]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:53:37.934 --> 01:53:42.635]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:53:43.155 --> 01:53:46.996]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:53:47.496 --> 01:53:48.516]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:53:48.596 --> 01:53:52.657]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:53:53.097 --> 01:53:57.478]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:53:57.998 --> 01:54:00.499]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:54:00.979 --> 01:54:02.660]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:02.981]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:54:18.558 --> 01:54:19.979]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:20.079 --> 01:54:20.860]  I'm David Knight.
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:23.502]  We're going to be joined in the next hour by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:54:23.522 --> 01:54:29.766]  We're going to be talking about this Mark Dice man on the street, as well as the whole issue underlying it.
[01:54:29.806 --> 01:54:37.652]  He talks to people, asks them if they'll sign a petition to impose a 10% tax for male privilege.
[01:54:38.533 --> 01:54:39.693]  Another one of these reports.
[01:54:40.414 --> 01:54:42.154]  And of course, it's California.
[01:54:42.334 --> 01:54:44.475]  You can find plenty of people to do things like that.
[01:54:45.875 --> 01:54:48.416]  Before we do, I saw this article today.
[01:54:49.637 --> 01:54:50.417]  New California.
[01:54:50.877 --> 01:54:53.238]  Mass immigration turning Virginia blue.
[01:54:53.338 --> 01:54:54.938]  This is off the Drudge Report.
[01:54:55.519 --> 01:54:58.600]  You need to understand where the open borders are coming from.
[01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:00.560]  I mean, there's a lot of different components to it.
[01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:02.261]  One of them, of course, is the fact that
[01:55:03.706 --> 01:55:07.992]  Politicians, Democrat and Republican, realize that we have a North American Union.
[01:55:08.093 --> 01:55:16.465]  As Pelosi pointed out, it's just we have, you know, one group of people here just happens to have one community just happens to have a border running through it.
[01:55:16.966 --> 01:55:18.628]  We had Petraeus point out
[01:55:19.269 --> 01:55:29.217]  That what comes after America, North America, specifically ties it to NAFTA, which essentially created the North American Union.
[01:55:29.257 --> 01:55:34.001]  It's going to become more consolidated, for sure, just as the European Union is becoming more consolidated.
[01:55:34.021 --> 01:55:35.422]  They're using the economic crisis.
[01:55:35.823 --> 01:55:43.189]  First they create an economic trading group, then they create an economic crisis, then they use that crisis as a means to seize political control.
[01:55:43.829 --> 01:55:46.071]  We can already see this happening throughout Europe.
[01:55:46.111 --> 01:55:48.652]  That's why Alex Jones is going through Europe.
[01:55:48.692 --> 01:55:53.976]  He's going to be filing reports about what is going on in Europe, the globalization plan.
[01:55:54.336 --> 01:56:03.882]  But when we come back to this article about how Virginia is turning into California, you need to understand that this is weaponized, politicized immigration.
[01:56:04.603 --> 01:56:06.264]  This is not about ethnicity.
[01:56:06.384 --> 01:56:08.425]  It's not about nation of origin.
[01:56:08.465 --> 01:56:11.848]  That's why I don't like the way that Donald Trump has pointed out
[01:56:12.688 --> 01:56:27.417]  He has hit a responding note with people because he has talked about what all of us realize is a problem, just the sheer magnitude of people coming in, regardless of where they're coming from, regardless even whether they're legal or illegal.
[01:56:28.257 --> 01:56:33.459]  The massive exporting of jobs at the same time that we bring in massive amounts of labor.
[01:56:33.479 --> 01:56:34.919]  It's going to increase unemployment.
[01:56:35.319 --> 01:56:37.600]  It's going to decrease our wages here.
[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:39.561]  You can see it, for example, in Disney.
[01:56:39.621 --> 01:56:41.741]  The people that they brought in to replace their workers.
[01:56:41.781 --> 01:56:42.902]  They brought them in from India.
[01:56:44.022 --> 01:56:46.763]  They told them, train your replacements and then you're fired.
[01:56:47.063 --> 01:56:47.583]  Get out of here.
[01:56:48.383 --> 01:56:48.643]  Okay?
[01:56:49.204 --> 01:56:53.525]  That was a visa program that was sold to people saying we need to bring in people who are
[01:56:54.824 --> 01:56:59.047]  Technically, in a technical, esoteric area.
[01:56:59.307 --> 01:57:01.988]  People that we can't, jobs that we can't fill here in America.
[01:57:02.048 --> 01:57:07.132]  Silicon Valley needs to bring in engineers and scientists who have a very narrow specialty.
[01:57:07.452 --> 01:57:09.533]  That's not the way it's being used by Disney.
[01:57:09.573 --> 01:57:10.374]  We see that everywhere.
[01:57:10.674 --> 01:57:12.575]  But look at this article about what's going on in Virginia.
[01:57:12.595 --> 01:57:18.319]  They say 3 out of 4 Virginia immigrants, 77%, are coming from either Latin America or Asia.
[01:57:19.588 --> 01:57:24.352]  They say, according to DHS, refugees issued admission slips in the United States.
[01:57:24.532 --> 01:57:27.455]  Of those, 75% came from four countries.
[01:57:27.795 --> 01:57:30.117]  Iraq, Burma, Somalia, Bhutan.
[01:57:30.678 --> 01:57:35.522]  Another 15% came from Iran, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, the Dominican Republic.
[01:57:35.542 --> 01:57:37.664]  You understand, the borders are open.
[01:57:37.944 --> 01:57:45.751]  The policy is to bring in as many people as they can from all over the world, because unlike any other country, we are going to make
[01:57:46.914 --> 01:57:49.557]  Everything in the welfare state available to everyone.
[01:57:49.717 --> 01:57:55.304]  We're going to treat our immigrants, legal and illegal, better than we do our American citizens.
[01:57:55.324 --> 01:57:58.347]  We're going to give them diplomatic immunity when they commit crimes.
[01:57:58.788 --> 01:57:59.969]  We're going to do a catch and release.
[01:57:59.989 --> 01:58:01.151]  We're not going to export them.
[01:58:01.831 --> 01:58:05.556]  If we do deport them, they can come right back in and do that again.
[01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:09.021]  That's the thing that concerns Americans.
[01:58:09.181 --> 01:58:15.385]  It's no longer a melting pot where people come to America on their own volition because they want to be freer.
[01:58:16.085 --> 01:58:24.911]  No, we're attracting people, we're drawing people in because they want to get a welfare check in many cases.
[01:58:25.391 --> 01:58:29.373]  They're also coming in because the criminals are coming in because of the drugs.
[01:58:29.393 --> 01:58:31.955]  You know that giant sucking sound that Ross Perot talked about?
[01:58:32.615 --> 01:58:35.958]  Maybe that's people in America snorting cocaine.
[01:58:36.038 --> 01:58:42.563]  Maybe it's the war on drugs that's bringing the kind of violent crime that people are fleeing in Central and South America.
[01:58:42.643 --> 01:58:44.765]  It's going to import that into America.
[01:58:45.125 --> 01:58:49.448]  We have to look at the causes of this and not just the consequences.
[01:58:49.468 --> 01:58:49.949]  Stay with us.
[01:58:50.369 --> 01:58:50.849]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:50.910 --> 01:58:54.492]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:54.512 --> 01:58:55.733]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:59.770 --> 01:59:00.130]  We're good.
[01:59:29.389 --> 01:59:32.570]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:59:32.890 --> 01:59:40.891]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:59:41.131 --> 01:59:46.173]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:59:46.553 --> 01:59:48.833]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:59:49.073 --> 01:59:50.854]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:00:02.152 --> 02:00:04.761]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:15.799 --> 02:00:19.984]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:20.645 --> 02:00:21.446]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.227 --> 02:00:23.128]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.768 --> 02:00:27.453]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.973 --> 02:00:32.038]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.775 --> 02:00:38.075]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:38.096 --> 02:00:40.977]  I'm David Nye, and I want to pick up where we left off just before the break.
[02:00:40.997 --> 02:00:45.198]  We were talking about how Virginia is becoming the new California.
[02:00:45.618 --> 02:00:48.099]  Immigrants are turning the area blue.
[02:00:48.199 --> 02:00:53.861]  And so many of you asked, many of you who voted for the GOP asked, well why won't the GOP oppose open borders?
[02:00:54.481 --> 02:00:58.423]  That's why Trump is soaring, is because he opposes that.
[02:00:59.622 --> 02:01:03.305]  That's what people thought they were voting for when they voted for Republicans in the Senate and the House.
[02:01:03.825 --> 02:01:04.645]  They're not getting that.
[02:01:04.705 --> 02:01:06.166]  Why aren't the Republicans doing that?
[02:01:06.727 --> 02:01:11.250]  It's going to be the extinction of the Republican Party, many people say, but they could care less, couldn't they?
[02:01:11.610 --> 02:01:11.870]  Why?
[02:01:12.531 --> 02:01:14.312]  Because it's simply a brand.
[02:01:15.112 --> 02:01:18.995]  The Republicans, especially at the top, don't stand for anything.
[02:01:19.315 --> 02:01:22.678]  It's like being a Dallas Cowboy or a Miami Dolphin.
[02:01:23.578 --> 02:01:24.479]  The players don't care.
[02:01:24.499 --> 02:01:26.080]  They just want to get the money.
[02:01:27.031 --> 02:01:29.233]  That's what the congressmen are all about.
[02:01:29.973 --> 02:01:32.115]  They could care less which team they're on.
[02:01:32.135 --> 02:01:46.726]  The teams exist only to get you interested in the game, just like they create these interesting NFL teams, make them territorial so people can root for their city, so they can root for a Dallas Cowboy or a Miami Dolphin.
[02:01:47.506 --> 02:01:49.488]  Okay, we got our donkeys and our elephants.
[02:01:49.528 --> 02:01:51.831]  People get so excited about all of that.
[02:01:51.851 --> 02:01:54.194]  It's just to get you involved in the game.
[02:01:54.214 --> 02:01:54.955]  They could care less.
[02:01:55.395 --> 02:01:58.278]  From the GOP side, they're pushing this for the U.S.
[02:01:58.338 --> 02:02:01.422]  Chamber of Commerce because they want to lower wages.
[02:02:02.423 --> 02:02:04.125]  They want to be able to export jobs.
[02:02:04.745 --> 02:02:06.467]  And that's precisely what we're getting.
[02:02:07.930 --> 02:02:09.431]  But of course, Trump is talking about it.
[02:02:09.471 --> 02:02:13.474]  Now Sheriff Joe is telling Trump, he says, let's go to Mexico.
[02:02:13.494 --> 02:02:19.698]  He says, I want to go to Mexico City, says Sheriff Joe, or somewhere in Mexico to talk to the officials, Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
[02:02:19.718 --> 02:02:26.262]  He says, now if Donald Trump wants to go with me, he can go with me, because we both will talk about the economy, which is very critical.
[02:02:27.002 --> 02:02:28.663]  So I'm not going to give in on this one.
[02:02:28.683 --> 02:02:31.165]  Well, OK, the real issue.
[02:02:32.068 --> 02:02:34.629]  If you're going to go there, it's about the war on drugs.
[02:02:34.669 --> 02:02:39.031]  And of course, Sheriff Joe is 100% for the war on drugs.
[02:02:39.411 --> 02:02:48.855]  The war on drugs that has failed now for 45 years, that has given us increased crime, increased corruption, increased drug use.
[02:02:49.256 --> 02:02:54.418]  It is nothing but a massive export of capital out of this country while we import crime.
[02:02:55.492 --> 02:02:57.233]  Why are we following this policy?
[02:02:57.253 --> 02:03:00.193]  Let me give you an example of how it's destroyed our legal system.
[02:03:00.814 --> 02:03:02.234]  Here's a story from the New American.
[02:03:02.574 --> 02:03:03.614]  This is out of Oklahoma.
[02:03:04.174 --> 02:03:09.156]  An Oklahoma DA used asset forfeiture money to pay his student loan.
[02:03:09.936 --> 02:03:16.418]  Now, asset forfeiture, civil asset forfeiture, is just outright theft by law enforcement.
[02:03:17.415 --> 02:03:18.455]  Here's a couple of examples.
[02:03:18.515 --> 02:03:27.178]  An assistant district attorney in the state of Oklahoma lived rent-free in a house confiscated by local law enforcement under the practice of asset forfeiture.
[02:03:27.738 --> 02:03:29.298]  His office paid the utility bills.
[02:03:29.798 --> 02:03:34.980]  He remained there for five years despite a court order to sell the house at auction.
[02:03:35.763 --> 02:03:43.309]  Another district attorney, second one, used $5,000 worth of confiscated funds to pay back his student loans.
[02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:48.213]  Now, this is a state senator in Oklahoma, Kyle Loveless.
[02:03:48.633 --> 02:03:56.379]  He says, the more I learn about it, the more upset and outraged I get that we've allowed this process to get to the point where it's at.
[02:03:57.239 --> 02:04:00.402]  He says your property is considered guilty until proven innocent.
[02:04:00.982 --> 02:04:05.085]  It's up to the individual to petition the government after they've seized it to prove that it is innocent.
[02:04:05.145 --> 02:04:07.007]  To me, on the face, that's un-American.
[02:04:07.427 --> 02:04:13.953]  Look, it would be un-American if you were considered to be guilty and you had to prove you're innocent.
[02:04:14.033 --> 02:04:20.898]  Because we have the presumption, or supposed to have had, going back to the Magna Carta, we're supposed to have the presumption of innocence.
[02:04:21.078 --> 02:04:26.743]  Say, right to a trial by jury, that we'd be found guilty of something before our property is confiscated.
[02:04:27.323 --> 02:04:28.764]  But it is none of those things.
[02:04:29.505 --> 02:04:30.565]  They take your property.
[02:04:30.845 --> 02:04:33.566]  Your property is accused of the crime.
[02:04:34.426 --> 02:04:35.687]  That's not un-American.
[02:04:35.707 --> 02:04:37.527]  That's Kafkaesque.
[02:04:38.127 --> 02:04:42.788]  That's like something out of a Kafka novel, saying that the property created a crime.
[02:04:43.088 --> 02:04:47.990]  Do you see how they twist the language, how they lie to us, how they steal from us?
[02:04:48.550 --> 02:04:50.070]  This is the war on drugs.
[02:04:50.670 --> 02:04:53.951]  This is the cause of the crime coming into our country.
[02:04:54.231 --> 02:04:56.212]  This is what created El Chapo.
[02:04:56.852 --> 02:04:58.433]  You wanna know how that guy became a billionaire?
[02:04:58.473 --> 02:04:59.753]  The same way Al Capone did.
[02:05:00.013 --> 02:05:03.995]  Except, with Al Capone, there was a constitutional amendment for prohibition.
[02:05:04.035 --> 02:05:08.396]  We never even bothered to pass a prohibition amendment for the war on drugs.
[02:05:08.436 --> 02:05:09.456]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:05:09.736 --> 02:05:15.739]  A group called Concerned Citizens is petitioning an Iowa school district to prevent students from attending a conference on bullying.
[02:05:16.059 --> 02:05:19.060]  The conference was set up by an activist group called Iowa Safe Schools.
[02:05:19.420 --> 02:05:22.661]  It was the content of the conference held in April, which has parents up in arms.
[02:05:22.941 --> 02:05:25.904]  Among the nearly two dozen speakers, only two addressed bullying.
[02:05:26.124 --> 02:05:29.587]  The rest of the sessions involved issues such as how to pleasure their gay partners.
[02:05:29.827 --> 02:05:34.812]  Middle school girls learned how to sew fake testicles into their underwear in order to pass themselves off as boys.
[02:05:35.132 --> 02:05:42.499]  And the featured speaker, drag performer Miss Coco Peru, cursed a lot and encouraged attendees to vandalize the property of LGBT critics.
[02:05:42.939 --> 02:05:44.220]  One parent summed it up like this.
[02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:45.601]  It wasn't really on bullying.
[02:05:45.822 --> 02:05:48.244]  It was basically a sex ed class for same-sex couples.
[02:05:48.524 --> 02:05:55.968]  Nate Monson, Executive Director of Iowa Safe Schools, said in response to the parents, it's incredibly frustrating that adults are being the problem and being the bully.
[02:05:56.108 --> 02:05:57.188]  We can do better in Iowa.
[02:05:57.409 --> 02:06:01.371]  The real plan is to sexualize your kids so more abortions can be performed.
[02:06:01.651 --> 02:06:03.992]  If you want to go deeper into the rabbit hole, check out the video
[02:06:04.232 --> 02:06:09.054]  How many people would you kill for a million dollars on the Alex Jones Channel and InfoWars.com?
[02:06:09.574 --> 02:06:12.555]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[02:07:18.386 --> 02:07:26.496]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:07:26.776 --> 02:07:31.478]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:07:31.638 --> 02:07:38.361]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:38.441 --> 02:07:45.525]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:07:45.625 --> 02:07:52.488]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:07:52.648 --> 02:07:57.009]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:07:57.109 --> 02:08:00.391]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[02:08:21.821 --> 02:08:29.545]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:35.540 --> 02:08:36.861]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:36.921 --> 02:08:38.201]  I'm David Knight here in Austin.
[02:08:38.661 --> 02:08:40.862]  Joining us now from England is Alex Jones.
[02:08:40.962 --> 02:08:44.124]  As I mentioned before, he's in Europe investigating a globalist takeover.
[02:08:44.204 --> 02:08:50.747]  He's going to be filing reports all week, co-hosting from Europe as he travels through there investigating it.
[02:08:51.347 --> 02:08:52.648]  Joining us live is Alex.
[02:08:52.728 --> 02:08:52.888]  Alex?
[02:08:54.696 --> 02:08:55.397]  That's right, David.
[02:08:55.417 --> 02:08:56.478]  Thank you for doing a great job.
[02:08:56.538 --> 02:09:10.213]  I'm going to be in the major cities of Madrid, Barcelona, Rome, Athens, you name it, in the next week and a half reporting live on what I see, but I wanted to stop off a few days here in the UK and jolly old England.
[02:09:10.965 --> 02:09:11.625]  We're good to go.
[02:09:30.596 --> 02:09:42.292]  And just people all in downtown London, people out in places like Avery, out in the countryside, people in small towns everywhere, gas stations, you name it, are huge listeners, are aware of what's going on.
[02:09:42.993 --> 02:09:46.939]  They're Christians, they're Muslims, they're black, they're white, they're old, they're young.
[02:09:47.952 --> 02:09:55.359]  They're aware of what's going on, but watching BBC television in my hotel room earlier this morning, I already knew about this a few months ago, but I didn't know it had escalated.
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:10:01.706]  They reported very calmly, David, like it was just talking about rain or something or a cricket game.
[02:10:02.106 --> 02:10:04.669]  They reported that they had opened the tunnel.
[02:10:05.249 --> 02:10:05.349]  Wow.
[02:10:23.792 --> 02:10:31.821]  And just right on top of the vehicles and the trains, soon they start robbing the trains and beating people and attacking them, in some cases hijacking them and killing them.
[02:10:31.861 --> 02:10:42.272]  And then Nico, our producer for the TV audience, has played the video many times the last month and a half of the hijacking of the buses, the hijacking of the 18 wheelers, the hijacking of the family cars.
[02:10:43.266 --> 02:10:43.606]  I don't know.
[02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:09.206]  Imagine as globalism and as N21 goes into high gear and shuts off more and more resources how insane this is going to get.
[02:11:09.586 --> 02:11:14.931]  But tomorrow we're going to be covering with Paul Watson and Rob Dew and myself, the City of London within London.
[02:11:15.291 --> 02:11:16.292]  We'll be doing call-ins.
[02:11:16.332 --> 02:11:17.433]  We're going to be filing reports.
[02:11:17.734 --> 02:11:28.784]  You're of course going to be riding, you know, basically as the conductor here or as the grand, who's the guy in an orchestra, the conductor who's running the whole show.
[02:11:29.504 --> 02:11:32.165]  And all week and next week we're going to have these reports.
[02:11:32.225 --> 02:11:38.106]  I'm going to be hosting via Skype and a lot more for the radio and TV audience of InfoWars.com.
[02:11:38.606 --> 02:11:40.026]  But so much is going on here.
[02:11:40.066 --> 02:11:51.108]  But another thing I noticed watching Sky Television, News Corp, Fox News here in the UK, and also watching BBC and listening to it on the radio, they are worshipping Obama.
[02:11:51.168 --> 02:11:55.069]  They are absolutely... He is the second coming of Christ.
[02:11:56.051 --> 02:11:56.972]  I don't know.
[02:12:10.405 --> 02:12:34.764]  Social engineering, but the good news is it transcends left or right people are really starting to wake up And really starting to realize what's happening David so again We're going to be here with you and the crew there in Austin, Texas Breaking this down filing detailed HD reports on the ground, but also doing live call-ins all sorts of original videos and especially produced reports Looking over this because you can watch TV.
[02:12:34.824 --> 02:12:39.888]  I can talk to experts I can read the financial publications all day long, but to get on the ground
[02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:40.940]  I don't know.
[02:13:01.795 --> 02:13:05.836]  We're pouring in that the EU then puts on welfare to further bankrupt the countries.
[02:13:06.276 --> 02:13:10.018]  I mean, this is a front row seat to economic warfare.
[02:13:10.278 --> 02:13:12.539]  We're not being captured and taken over by tanks.
[02:13:13.039 --> 02:13:14.859]  We're being captured and taken over by banks.
[02:13:15.419 --> 02:13:19.361]  And so that's why I'm here in the EU covering all of this.
[02:13:19.401 --> 02:13:24.242]  Because, you know, I sent the reporters, Rob Doo and Josh Owens and others to cover Bilderberg a few months ago.
[02:13:24.682 --> 02:13:25.983]  I sent Joe Biggs down to the border.
[02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:31.385]  That made national news with Josh Owens, and of course they caught the footage of the drugs being brought in across.
[02:13:31.426 --> 02:13:32.687]  You were just exposing the drug war.
[02:13:33.067 --> 02:13:35.210]  It's not that we're for throwing people in jail for drugs.
[02:13:35.691 --> 02:13:37.393]  We realize the whole thing's a fraud.
[02:13:37.753 --> 02:13:41.498]  They made the drugs illegal to jack up the prices and control the population.
[02:13:41.538 --> 02:13:42.519]  But still, regardless...
[02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:47.141]  They're telling us we're taking your rights and freedom to keep you safe from drugs and terrorism.
[02:13:47.522 --> 02:13:54.444]  The truth is, just like narcotics and just like Al-Qaeda or ISIS, it's run by the criminal megabanks that have hijacked this country.
[02:13:54.524 --> 02:13:55.365]  They are the enemies.
[02:13:55.765 --> 02:14:02.087]  And if we can't identify that organization, if we can't reveal what they've done, we have absolutely no hope.
[02:14:02.127 --> 02:14:07.329]  But the good news is, as the real enemies are identified, as the people of the world come together, it's over.
[02:14:07.709 --> 02:14:09.970]  The most important thing I can say is to the listeners.
[02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:15.193]  I've already run into at the airport and at my hotel and then out in the middle of nowhere.
[02:14:15.213 --> 02:14:19.877]  Again, I want to travel the middle of nowhere, go into a pub.
[02:14:19.897 --> 02:14:21.438]  There's like 15 people in it.
[02:14:21.778 --> 02:14:24.620]  Six of them know who I am and come over and say they're listeners.
[02:14:24.980 --> 02:14:25.621]  Six people.
[02:14:26.662 --> 02:14:33.390]  15 people at the Red Lion Pub and Inn in Avery.
[02:14:33.930 --> 02:14:34.631]  That's where I am right now.
[02:14:34.671 --> 02:14:35.412]  I'm not staying there.
[02:14:35.432 --> 02:14:36.073]  I'm about to leave.
[02:14:36.093 --> 02:14:37.434]  But the point is, I'm about to go back to London.
[02:14:37.815 --> 02:14:39.497]  The point is, that's what's happening.
[02:14:39.537 --> 02:14:40.258]  That's what's going on.
[02:14:40.498 --> 02:14:42.701]  That's the power of people seeking out the truth.
[02:14:43.241 --> 02:14:44.962]  They don't know because they're not well known.
[02:14:45.002 --> 02:14:46.042]  Their faces aren't known.
[02:14:46.363 --> 02:14:47.423]  They don't get recognized.
[02:14:47.923 --> 02:14:51.785]  They don't know that there's a movement worldwide awake to this.
[02:14:51.825 --> 02:14:54.206]  They don't know how much power the liberty movement has.
[02:14:54.246 --> 02:14:56.167]  So when I bring this up, I'm bragging.
[02:14:56.507 --> 02:14:58.468]  I'm letting them know you're not alone.
[02:14:58.809 --> 02:15:05.732]  You have fellow liberty lovers from race, color, and creed around the world that are aware of what's happening and understand
[02:15:06.405 --> 02:15:07.166]  We're good to go.
[02:15:28.032 --> 02:15:33.157]  Control as the so-called answer to the crisis that they felt basically create.
[02:15:33.538 --> 02:15:43.868]  So David, I really appreciate you doing a great job while I'm gone and the rest of the crew and I'm going to go ahead and hand the reins back over to you, my friends, because it's not just about Alex Jones or anybody or InfoWars or David Knight.
[02:15:44.128 --> 02:15:48.813]  It's all of you that are the human resistance to the globalists in this high tech tyranny.
[02:15:49.875 --> 02:15:50.556]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:15:50.616 --> 02:15:57.701]  It's very interesting, too, to hear you talk about how they're treating Obama as God, because, of course, we've seen the clips of him talking about gun control.
[02:15:57.721 --> 02:16:01.744]  But the other thing he said was, uh, England needs to stay in the EU.
[02:16:01.844 --> 02:16:03.185]  Don't leave the EU.
[02:16:03.945 --> 02:16:05.246]  And he's saying, we need you.
[02:16:05.286 --> 02:16:08.149]  You're an important transatlantic partner.
[02:16:08.809 --> 02:16:11.272]  They don't want to see anybody get out of the EU.
[02:16:11.312 --> 02:16:18.761]  They want to keep everybody in the EU because they are now consolidating these regional groups into the next step of global governance.
[02:16:18.781 --> 02:16:25.249]  But as Alex was pointing out, this global collapse of the economy, look at how it's playing out in Puerto Rico, for example.
[02:16:25.750 --> 02:16:26.151]  We've got
[02:16:27.472 --> 02:16:32.079]  An article from Wall Street pointing out that UBS's Puerto Rico bond funds are imploding.
[02:16:32.740 --> 02:16:35.603]  Collateral value has dropped to zero.
[02:16:36.224 --> 02:16:37.666]  Investors are screwed.
[02:16:37.807 --> 02:16:38.487]  That's the headline.
[02:16:38.988 --> 02:16:45.230]  He says, we believe the probability of default is approaching 100% and that losses given default are substantial.
[02:16:45.270 --> 02:16:48.611]  That's from Moody's, the people that rate these bond funds.
[02:16:49.291 --> 02:16:59.574]  They're talking about $72 billion in bonds that were stuffed into numerous conservative-sounding bond funds spread across America's retirement portfolios.
[02:16:59.614 --> 02:17:00.714]  Where have we seen this before?
[02:17:01.374 --> 02:17:04.620]  Does this sound like the collapse of the mortgage market?
[02:17:04.660 --> 02:17:08.827]  Well, now they're doing it with municipal bonds in other countries, like in Puerto Rico.
[02:17:10.151 --> 02:17:11.811]  This is the way this all plays out.
[02:17:12.071 --> 02:17:23.214]  This is why there is massive immigration that is faster than the economies can absorb from third world countries into first world countries, just as Alex was talking about going on in Europe.
[02:17:23.874 --> 02:17:24.794]  That's why they're doing this.
[02:17:24.854 --> 02:17:27.874]  They have to implode the first world economies in the same way.
[02:17:27.894 --> 02:17:29.815]  They've gone to all of these third world economies.
[02:17:30.455 --> 02:17:34.976]  After World War II, they went in essentially operating as rent seekers.
[02:17:35.916 --> 02:17:46.302]  Setting these countries up on massive loans from the IMF, from the World Bank, from the central bankers, the same people that we see as the troika hammering Greece.
[02:17:47.162 --> 02:17:57.668]  They came in, they said we want you to create a socialist state and we're going to loan you money that you can just turn around and hand back in non-productive ways to the poor in your country.
[02:17:57.788 --> 02:18:03.552]  Instead of making people wealthy, we're going to have you put them on a welfare program.
[02:18:04.611 --> 02:18:08.254]  And eventually, what happens is you run out of other people's money.
[02:18:08.274 --> 02:18:14.139]  And when you run out of other people's money, they come in and they take your hard assets.
[02:18:14.159 --> 02:18:15.200]  That's what's going on in Greece.
[02:18:15.580 --> 02:18:20.684]  Again, going back to Puerto Rico, they say about $26 billion in bonds fall into this category.
[02:18:21.004 --> 02:18:28.450]  Things like the government's Development Bank, Highways and Transportation Authority, Infrastructure Finance Authority, Municipal Finance Authority.
[02:18:29.551 --> 02:18:40.676]  Now, these things that would be building infrastructure, they're no longer able to support these because of the massive overextending of credit, largely to pay for welfare programs.
[02:18:41.276 --> 02:18:44.558]  They're pointing out that UBS is heavily involved in this.
[02:18:44.578 --> 02:18:53.822]  They say UBS, despite well-known problems that Puerto Rico has been having for years, was not shy about loading up its clients with these worthless bonds.
[02:18:54.022 --> 02:18:56.503]  Same thing we saw happen in the mortgage buildup, remember?
[02:18:57.043 --> 02:18:58.564]  They collateralized all these things.
[02:18:58.584 --> 02:19:06.786]  They sold them out there as good investments when they were just garbage mortgage loans.
[02:19:07.286 --> 02:19:12.187]  They say they encourage people to borrow money from UBS in order to buy these things.
[02:19:12.247 --> 02:19:13.108]  Do it on credit.
[02:19:13.188 --> 02:19:14.068]  Do it with leverage.
[02:19:15.148 --> 02:19:19.512]  That's why so many people say we need to go back to Glass-Steagall.
[02:19:19.552 --> 02:19:33.063]  We need to make sure that the banks who are insured by the countries are not going to be allowed to participate in this kind of highly leveraged activity that we saw happen with the mortgage implosion.
[02:19:33.083 --> 02:19:34.184]  But of course, they're doing it here.
[02:19:34.204 --> 02:19:35.345]  They're doing it in Puerto Rico.
[02:19:35.385 --> 02:19:43.572]  And they say that since the collapse of Puerto Rico bonds, the funds have become, quote-unquote, legal headaches for UBS, as Reuters put it.
[02:19:44.252 --> 02:19:48.914]  We see the same pattern of behavior everywhere from these banks.
[02:19:49.674 --> 02:19:54.796]  And now we have a massive exodus of people from Puerto Rico that are going to Florida.
[02:19:55.176 --> 02:19:56.176]  These are people who are U.S.
[02:19:56.216 --> 02:19:56.717]  citizens.
[02:19:56.757 --> 02:19:58.157]  They will be allowed to vote in Florida.
[02:19:58.177 --> 02:19:59.818]  It will change the landscape.
[02:20:00.098 --> 02:20:01.258]  It will change the election.
[02:20:01.578 --> 02:20:02.058]  Stay with us.
[02:20:02.179 --> 02:20:02.759]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:09.952 --> 02:20:15.737]  So I say to Mark at lunch, look, you know, I keep hearing from the government that, you know, they're worried someday ISIS may get here.
[02:20:16.037 --> 02:20:21.521]  Then I go, duh, Garland, Texas, Mohammed cartoon shooting, ISIS is already here.
[02:20:21.881 --> 02:20:23.903]  I'm not waiting for these people to defend me.
[02:20:24.043 --> 02:20:28.226]  If they don't know ISIS is here already, they got no clue, I'm taking care of myself.
[02:20:28.447 --> 02:20:34.932]  Guns80.com, AR-15 kits, 30 shot magazines, great prices, they've even got the Hillary special.

[02:21:09.628 --> 02:21:10.449]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[02:21:10.549 --> 02:21:10.990]  Good, brother.
[02:21:11.130 --> 02:21:12.852]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:21:12.872 --> 02:21:14.675]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:21:14.795 --> 02:21:18.820]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:21:18.840 --> 02:21:19.581]  Well, thank you, brother.
[02:21:19.621 --> 02:21:23.666]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:21:23.886 --> 02:21:25.929]  Super Mill Vitality was developed.
[02:21:26.169 --> 02:21:31.796]  To activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:21:32.037 --> 02:21:35.161]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[02:21:35.281 --> 02:21:36.803]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:21:36.843 --> 02:21:39.747]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:21:39.767 --> 02:21:41.249]  Saving a ton of money there.
[02:21:41.529 --> 02:21:43.972]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[02:21:44.633 --> 02:21:45.493]  We're good to go.
[02:22:09.796 --> 02:22:15.998]  Usually, the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[02:22:16.538 --> 02:22:20.319]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[02:22:20.919 --> 02:22:23.900]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[02:22:24.421 --> 02:22:25.021]  Not fun!
[02:22:25.561 --> 02:22:33.363]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[02:22:33.963 --> 02:22:38.725]  One World Whey is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[02:22:39.065 --> 02:22:39.866]  My name is Errol.
[02:22:40.226 --> 02:22:41.567]  I'm 74 years old.
[02:22:41.747 --> 02:22:44.169]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[02:22:44.329 --> 02:22:51.795]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your trace mineral supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[02:22:52.175 --> 02:22:58.240]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.

[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:20.781]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:20.821 --> 02:24:24.483]  I'm David Knight, your host, and we just heard from Alex.
[02:24:24.563 --> 02:24:26.945]  He's in England right now.
[02:24:27.005 --> 02:24:37.691]  He's going to be traveling across Europe, investigating the globalist takeover, what they're doing to collapse the areas economically, so they can then move in and take their sovereignty.
[02:24:37.731 --> 02:24:39.492]  That's been the stated goal.
[02:24:41.793 --> 02:24:49.615]  The only way we're going to solve these problems in Portugal and Italy and Ireland and Greece and Spain is for them to give up their sovereignty.
[02:24:50.095 --> 02:24:51.036]  Alan Greenspan said it.
[02:24:51.136 --> 02:24:54.036]  The head of the largest bond fund in the world, Pemko, said it.
[02:24:54.737 --> 02:24:55.897]  Many people have said that.
[02:24:55.997 --> 02:24:58.498]  They actually have done that now in Greece.
[02:24:58.598 --> 02:25:02.539]  They held a referendum and said, no, we don't like the terms that the Troika has given us.
[02:25:02.559 --> 02:25:03.559]  And they said, well, we don't care.
[02:25:04.588 --> 02:25:07.149]  We're going to set economic rules for you.
[02:25:07.169 --> 02:25:09.791]  We're going to give you a long list of regulations.
[02:25:09.891 --> 02:25:13.112]  We're going to take 50 billion euros worth of hard assets.
[02:25:13.672 --> 02:25:20.276]  We're going to extend credit to you of another 36 billion so you can continue to make payments, get further in debt, extend and pretend that you're getting out of debt.
[02:25:21.555 --> 02:25:23.476]  That's the way they're rolling this thing out.
[02:25:23.956 --> 02:25:26.557]  This is going to be the plan for every one of us.
[02:25:26.637 --> 02:25:31.579]  And so we need to learn from the tragic mistakes that have been made in Greece.
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:32.800]  We need to stop this.
[02:25:32.820 --> 02:25:33.640]  We need to pull back.
[02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:38.222]  As Alex pointed out, Obama is being hailed by the British media.
[02:25:38.262 --> 02:25:39.363]  That's what he sees there.
[02:25:39.403 --> 02:25:41.263]  They're hailing him as a savior.
[02:25:41.303 --> 02:25:41.624]  Why?
[02:25:42.064 --> 02:25:49.287]  Because he's there pushing back against the rising movement in all these different countries to try to get out of this European Union.
[02:25:49.847 --> 02:25:51.228]  He's saying, no, don't get out.
[02:25:51.548 --> 02:25:52.068]  We need you.
[02:25:52.188 --> 02:25:55.529]  You're important partners in the transatlantic union.
[02:25:56.610 --> 02:25:58.451]  That's what they're pushing now with everybody.
[02:25:58.871 --> 02:26:02.732]  But people are starting to see the handwriting on the wall as they realize this is a secret treaty.
[02:26:03.133 --> 02:26:09.555]  The TTIP, the TPP are both secret treaties that have been negotiated and written by corporations.
[02:26:10.015 --> 02:26:14.497]  Our elected representatives are not even allowed to see them, let alone us.
[02:26:15.518 --> 02:26:17.158]  So this whole thing is a sham.
[02:26:18.679 --> 02:26:21.642]  And again, Alex is going to be joining us all week with reports from there.
[02:26:21.662 --> 02:26:24.926]  We're going to be joined in the next segment by Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:26:25.606 --> 02:26:27.849]  There's an article that's up on Drudge.
[02:26:28.169 --> 02:26:36.898]  It's another petition video from Mark Dice, getting liberals to sign a petition to impose a 10% male privilege tax.
[02:26:37.559 --> 02:26:41.102]  And Paul Joseph Watson points out in his article that wraps that video.
[02:26:41.863 --> 02:26:45.935]  Despite the fact that the gender pay gap is a complete myth.
[02:26:46.055 --> 02:26:49.766]  So we're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson about that in the next segment.
[02:26:50.807 --> 02:26:57.775]  Now, before we go to that, I just want to let you know this hour of the Alex Jones Show is brought to you by the products that we sell at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:26:57.815 --> 02:27:00.758]  We now have in stock Survival Shield X2.
[02:27:00.778 --> 02:27:04.822]  Remember, we have free shipping for just a couple more days in the month of July.
[02:27:06.043 --> 02:27:10.327]  X2 has over 400 positive reviews on InfoWarsLife.com, over 99%.
[02:27:12.049 --> 02:27:16.514]  Of those reviews, the people say they would recommend it to a friend or a family member.
[02:27:17.114 --> 02:27:21.479]  So take a look at those reviews about Nascent Iodine, that Survival Shield X2.
[02:27:21.519 --> 02:27:24.041]  You can see those at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:27:24.101 --> 02:27:28.165]  Also, we still have in supply some of our newest product, Deep Cleanse.
[02:27:28.586 --> 02:27:29.827]  That was just introduced last week.
[02:27:29.887 --> 02:27:33.250]  It sold out half of the large shipment that we got in.
[02:27:33.310 --> 02:27:35.433]  Alex said he doubled the size of the shipment.
[02:27:35.993 --> 02:27:38.136]  Nevertheless, half of it sold out in the first day.
[02:27:38.816 --> 02:27:44.363]  We've sold out about 85% of this first run, but it is still available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:27:44.864 --> 02:27:54.515]  Deep Cleanze is an all-in-one total body cleanser that uses nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients to cleanse chemicals and toxic metals from the body.
[02:27:55.296 --> 02:28:02.679]  It's a way to fight back against all the toxic pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and metals that are in your food supply.
[02:28:02.699 --> 02:28:04.839]  Again, you can get that at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:16.684]  It's nearly sold out, but we still have some of that left, and anything that you get at InfoWarsLife.com is free shipping through the end of July, and there's only three or four days left of that.
[02:28:17.461 --> 02:28:32.868]  Now as I mentioned, Paul Joseph Watson is going to be coming on the next segment to talk to us about this article that he wrote around the video that Mark Dice did, having liberals sign a petition to impose a 10% male privilege tax.
[02:28:32.888 --> 02:28:34.509]  Let's take a look at that video.
[02:28:35.808 --> 02:28:51.381]  I'm going to ask people to help fight income inequality by signing a petition to tax men at a higher rate, calling it the male privilege tax, to see if these feminist fools will sign a sexist petition to fight supposed sexism.
[02:28:51.721 --> 02:28:53.783]  We're trying to implement a male privilege tax.
[02:28:54.423 --> 02:28:54.784]  Really?
[02:28:54.844 --> 02:28:55.644]  How does that work?
[02:28:56.065 --> 02:29:03.210]  It would be just a simple 10% tax on men's income, since they make more money, just to help offset the costs and the incomes.
[02:29:03.230 --> 02:29:03.731]  That's really interesting.
[02:29:04.491 --> 02:29:07.594]  And we need a few more signatures to support the male privilege tax.
[02:29:07.634 --> 02:29:08.655]  Definitely sign for that.
[02:29:08.735 --> 02:29:10.016]  Definitely sign for that.
[02:29:10.677 --> 02:29:13.099]  You know, these women, you guys don't make as much money.
[02:29:13.960 --> 02:29:17.223]  And, you know, men make so much more money than the women.
[02:29:17.783 --> 02:29:23.168]  The thing we can do to fight sexism is to really implement the male privilege tax.
[02:29:23.369 --> 02:29:30.295]  Yeah, I've never heard of that before, but whatever they're trying to do right now is clearly not working, so I'm all for giving it a shot.
[02:29:31.008 --> 02:29:34.610]  Male privilege tax will definitely solve a lot of these sexist problems.
[02:29:34.630 --> 02:29:35.250]  Thanks to the other guy.
[02:29:35.270 --> 02:29:35.730]  Thank you for helping.
[02:29:35.770 --> 02:29:36.891]  Especially when he's a guy and you're not.
[02:29:36.991 --> 02:29:45.915]  Women make a lot less money than men, and so we're going to implement the male privilege tax just to tax the men at a slightly higher rate to help offset the income inequality.
[02:29:46.476 --> 02:29:47.816]  Need a few more signatures.
[02:29:48.497 --> 02:29:51.698]  Print your name, birthdate, and a signature.
[02:29:52.379 --> 02:29:55.160]  Okay, so we're going to have Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:29:55.200 --> 02:29:58.582]  We're going to play a little bit more of that for you, and he's going to talk about the reality.
[02:29:59.102 --> 02:30:00.384]  When we come back, stay with us.
[02:30:10.399 --> 02:30:11.300]  Who do you prefer?
[02:30:11.620 --> 02:30:14.843]  Barack Obama or George W. Bush?
[02:30:15.203 --> 02:30:20.147]  Well, if you haven't figured it out by now, these guys are corporate spokesmen.
[02:30:20.187 --> 02:30:20.988]  They're not leaders.
[02:30:21.228 --> 02:30:23.550]  I mean, they both started illegal wars.
[02:30:23.890 --> 02:30:25.471]  Hell, they both tortured people.
[02:30:25.711 --> 02:30:29.314]  They bailed out criminal corporations and they spied on you.
[02:30:29.494 --> 02:30:33.878]  They both violated the Constitution and they even committed war crimes.
[02:30:34.218 --> 02:30:35.099]  So what's it gonna take?
[02:30:35.379 --> 02:30:37.821]  I mean, what will it take to finally wake you up?
[02:30:38.121 --> 02:30:38.662]  Think about it.
[02:30:38.942 --> 02:30:47.869]  If Joseph Stalin ran for president as a Democrat, and Adolf Hitler ran as a Republican, one of them would end up leading our country.
[02:30:48.210 --> 02:30:50.131]  It's politics incorporated.
[02:30:50.372 --> 02:30:53.774]  And your choice between the two parties is a myth.
[02:30:53.975 --> 02:30:58.739]  Because in reality, it is a two-party tyranny with one ideology.
[02:30:58.859 --> 02:31:00.340]  Divide and conquer.
[02:31:00.600 --> 02:31:05.302]  So join the revolution and break the false left versus right paradigm.
[02:31:05.562 --> 02:31:07.363]  Infowars.com.
[02:31:09.764 --> 02:31:15.567]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[02:31:15.887 --> 02:31:20.209]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[02:31:20.469 --> 02:31:28.193]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[02:31:28.413 --> 02:31:33.635]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[02:31:33.935 --> 02:31:39.517]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[02:31:39.897 --> 02:31:44.779]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[02:31:44.839 --> 02:31:48.440]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:31:48.780 --> 02:31:54.982]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:31:55.382 --> 02:32:00.366]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[02:32:00.546 --> 02:32:04.088]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:04.268 --> 02:32:08.691]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:32:09.452 --> 02:32:14.195]  Alex Jones here with Infowarslife.com Consumer Alert Report.
[02:32:14.635 --> 02:32:21.620]  Many of you are aware that around the world, most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[02:32:22.020 --> 02:32:24.702]  Iodine is the good member of the halogen family.
[02:32:24.922 --> 02:32:27.423]  Things like fluoride are the bad halogens.
[02:32:27.864 --> 02:32:35.628]  The good news is, our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[02:32:35.928 --> 02:32:47.255]  The bad news is, the supply of these deep earth crystals, that exclusive 999 pure source, is proprietary and only available to Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:47.435 --> 02:32:50.337]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[02:32:50.737 --> 02:32:57.422]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[02:32:57.863 --> 02:33:00.745]  Remember, this iodine stores safely for years.
[02:33:01.305 --> 02:33:05.288]  Available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:33:24.815 --> 02:33:27.021]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:27.503 --> 02:33:32.617]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:40.410 --> 02:33:41.650]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:41.730 --> 02:33:42.911]  I'm David Knight in Austin.
[02:33:42.971 --> 02:33:46.192]  Joining us now is Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[02:33:46.792 --> 02:33:49.113]  He had an article that was on Drudge earlier today.
[02:33:49.193 --> 02:33:53.014]  Liberals signed a petition to impose a 10% male privilege tax.
[02:33:53.054 --> 02:33:56.355]  Just before we went to break, we played the video that was embedded there.
[02:33:56.395 --> 02:34:07.178]  That was Mark Dice, again, going into California trying to get people to sign a petition that is absolutely insane and having no problem whatsoever in getting them to do it.
[02:34:07.578 --> 02:34:14.863]  Now, Paul Joseph Watson wrote an article wrapped around that, talking about the myth of gender pay gap.
[02:34:14.883 --> 02:34:16.944]  So joining us now is Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:34:16.964 --> 02:34:17.425]  Welcome, Paul.
[02:34:18.425 --> 02:34:18.866]  Hi, David.
[02:34:18.886 --> 02:34:19.446]  Good to be back.
[02:34:20.667 --> 02:34:23.969]  Now, this article that we had, we were just watching part of that video.
[02:34:23.989 --> 02:34:26.170]  We'll play some more of that for people in just a moment.
[02:34:26.210 --> 02:34:30.013]  But talk for a moment about the myth of gender pay gap.
[02:34:31.530 --> 02:34:38.572]  Well, yeah, this is one of those feminist sacred cows that we hear over and over again, but it's been completely debunked.
[02:34:38.632 --> 02:34:46.675]  In fact, there's a video by Christina Hoff Summers in that article on Infowars, and she's a dissident feminist.
[02:34:46.835 --> 02:34:48.856]  She's an actual first-wave feminist.
[02:34:49.156 --> 02:34:59.059]  All the radicals basically hate her because she's very reasonable in her work, and she's done some great analysis of this, which is the fact that
[02:34:59.659 --> 02:35:16.007]  This gender pay gap, which they claim runs from anything from 17% to 23% of income, disappears, almost disappears, when you factor in the choices for jobs that men make and the fact that they work longer hours.
[02:35:16.527 --> 02:35:20.910]  So once these factors and others are actually brought into consideration,
[02:35:21.823 --> 02:35:24.104]  That gender wage gap completely disappears.
[02:35:24.525 --> 02:35:34.991]  So again, they've been flouting these fraudulent statistics about it for years, similar to the, you know, one in five or one in four college women are raped on campus.
[02:35:35.051 --> 02:35:36.391]  Again, completely debunked.
[02:35:36.892 --> 02:35:40.914]  But these myths perpetuate because of the leftist media.
[02:35:41.274 --> 02:35:43.776]  So of course, you play the video, Mark Dice goes out.
[02:35:44.196 --> 02:35:47.558]  As long as he says the words, you know, racist or sexist and acts
[02:35:48.358 --> 02:35:52.061]  As an authoritarian figure, they sign away the petition.
[02:35:52.662 --> 02:36:00.228]  Even though, in fact, on that video, there are people in the background, women in the background, saying, you know, I earn more than my husband.
[02:36:00.288 --> 02:36:01.149]  What's wrong with that?
[02:36:01.449 --> 02:36:03.631]  It's down to what jobs you choose to do.
[02:36:04.091 --> 02:36:05.472]  Which is exactly the case.
[02:36:05.532 --> 02:36:14.779]  So again, it strikes at the heart of how they will believe these statistics with no consideration, no investigation whatsoever.
[02:36:15.640 --> 02:36:17.982]  And then claim that it represents male privilege.
[02:36:18.683 --> 02:36:26.411]  Does the fact that, you know, 93% of workplace deaths being men, does that represent male privilege?
[02:36:26.931 --> 02:36:35.019]  Does the fact that 94% of workplace suicides every year are men, also represent male privilege?
[02:36:35.620 --> 02:36:48.686]  Again, you have these women going into university doing gender studies classes, they're not doing the STEM subjects, they're not doing science, they're not doing engineering, and then feminists whine about the fact that men are paid more.
[02:36:48.727 --> 02:36:52.728]  Well yeah, they're doing different higher paid jobs and they're working for longer hours.
[02:36:53.109 --> 02:36:55.010]  So of course they're going to be paid more.
[02:36:55.350 --> 02:36:59.572]  It has nothing to do with the evil patriarchy oppressing women.
[02:37:00.370 --> 02:37:01.190]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:37:01.290 --> 02:37:04.812]  It's using statistics in a way to get the desired outcome.
[02:37:04.852 --> 02:37:07.213]  We see that happening all the time with people.
[02:37:07.473 --> 02:37:18.997]  I think there's also an aspect of it, Paul, where you've got a group of people and it's so easy to raise taxes when you come to one group and you say, I'm going to raise taxes on the other guy.
[02:37:19.037 --> 02:37:19.797]  Will you vote for that?
[02:37:20.337 --> 02:37:21.998]  That's a large part of what this is about.
[02:37:22.018 --> 02:37:27.460]  As I'm watching these women sign that petition, they're saying, oh yeah, raise taxes on the other guy?
[02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:29.241]  I'm all for that because I'm not a guy.
[02:37:30.426 --> 02:37:32.834]  So they sign up for that right away.
[02:37:33.215 --> 02:37:36.827]  It's like when people have gone to Walmart and petitioned for...
[02:37:37.637 --> 02:37:40.979]  Minimum wages at, you know, 15% hike or whatever, $15.
[02:37:41.359 --> 02:37:48.363]  And then they say, oh, by the way, do you want to pay double for that discount television that you've just purchased?
[02:37:48.423 --> 02:37:49.224]  And they say, well, no.
[02:37:49.244 --> 02:37:52.745]  So as long as it doesn't affect them, they're all for it.
[02:37:52.765 --> 02:37:56.448]  But of course, everything related to that eventually will affect them.
[02:37:57.068 --> 02:37:58.909]  And they don't realize that at the time.
[02:37:59.449 --> 02:38:00.130]  But there's also
[02:38:01.110 --> 02:38:11.318]  Another piece that I posted on InfoWars about an hour ago, which is, again, completely ridiculous, as you would expect from feminists, but this is a Washington Post columnist saying this.
[02:38:11.878 --> 02:38:21.385]  And again, I get this, I get this over and over again, where people say, you know, why are you talking about these insane ideas and proposals that feminists come up with?
[02:38:21.425 --> 02:38:26.990]  They've got no power, they've got no influence, they're just ranting on their little Tumblr blogs.
[02:38:27.070 --> 02:38:28.211]  Nobody's paying attention.
[02:38:28.931 --> 02:38:30.612]  Well now that's not the case.
[02:38:30.692 --> 02:38:33.832]  A lot of these articles are in major publications.
[02:38:33.892 --> 02:38:43.135]  Of course last week we had the man who felt guilty about the fact that he wasn't letting his wife sleep with other men because he was a feminist.
[02:38:43.175 --> 02:38:46.036]  His wife with whom he had two small children.
[02:38:46.536 --> 02:38:50.497]  That was in nymag.com, again another major publication.
[02:38:50.937 --> 02:38:52.458]  You had the guy in Slate
[02:38:53.058 --> 02:39:05.808]  Another feminist writing in a big leftist publication that barbecues were inherently sexist because they reinforced traditional gender roles and were inherently misogynistic.
[02:39:06.249 --> 02:39:07.670]  Again, complete lunacy.
[02:39:08.010 --> 02:39:16.337]  But it's being published in a major news outlet, which is part of this process which people have called the mainstreaming of lunacy.
[02:39:17.017 --> 02:39:22.718]  And you know, if it's not consistently challenged, then that kind of warped thinking becomes the norm.
[02:39:22.758 --> 02:39:26.559]  We've seen it with the whole Caitlyn Jenner fiasco, of course.
[02:39:27.599 --> 02:39:35.860]  That was sold as this big transgender rights issue, where Caitlyn Jenner got this Courage Award at the ESPN event.
[02:39:36.380 --> 02:39:44.722]  Again, it's come out today that that was a cynical negotiation between Caitlyn Jenner's people and ESPN.
[02:39:45.362 --> 02:39:51.604]  They said, if you give us the award, we will give you free plugs on Caitlyn Jenner's TV show.
[02:39:52.124 --> 02:40:01.306]  And Jenner, in fact, threatened to pull out of the ABC 2020 interview if he, she, whatever you want to call her, wasn't given that award.
[02:40:01.746 --> 02:40:13.569]  So again, another public relations stunt based around money, and yet it was sold as this huge, you know, LGBT rights issue when it was a completely cynical hoax.
[02:40:14.289 --> 02:40:22.551]  So we've got another article on InfoWars right now which is, Washington Post columnist, air conditioning is sexist.
[02:40:23.345 --> 02:40:25.426]  Again, this is not out of the onion.
[02:40:25.466 --> 02:40:43.470]  This is a serious article where this Washington Post columnist, Petula Dvorak, says that because women tend to wear less clothes in summer, and of course the AC is turned up, they're freezing to death in the office, whereas men who wear full suits are fine.
[02:40:43.890 --> 02:40:51.912]  And she's saying that that is, quote, another big sexist plot on behalf of the evil patriarchy.
[02:40:52.452 --> 02:40:58.159]  Again, it's not due to the fact that if you wear more clothes you will tend to be warmer.
[02:40:58.940 --> 02:41:01.663]  It's, again, it's a huge sexist conspiracy, so...
[02:41:02.719 --> 02:41:05.300]  Again, it's the mainstreaming of lunacy.
[02:41:05.420 --> 02:41:06.860]  This is becoming the norm now.
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:10.241]  Maybe she's being sexist for saying women are wearing less clothing.
[02:41:10.401 --> 02:41:15.463]  Maybe is she implying that women are using less clothing for a reason in the workplace?
[02:41:15.923 --> 02:41:26.086]  It's absolutely insane, Paul, because we see them using the labels sexist or racist to make it for any cause that they want to promote.
[02:41:26.106 --> 02:41:29.487]  You know, you were talking about barbecue grilling, now you're talking about air conditioning.
[02:41:29.827 --> 02:41:47.214]  Let's understand that there is an agenda here that is trying to demonize various things that we have in modern society for the sake of creating some kind of a global carbon tax that's going to go to a few carbon billionaires like Al Gore.
[02:41:47.514 --> 02:41:50.895]  That's what's really behind this agenda and they try to paint this
[02:41:51.275 --> 02:42:03.379]  As a high moral cause, just as we saw with the Pope embracing this, even bringing into his Vatican Scientific Advisory Council a guy who is a radical depopulationist.
[02:42:04.219 --> 02:42:13.802]  That's the thing that they're most concerned about, and they take the moral high ground by labeling everything as sexist or racist, but it's backfiring on them because people are seeing through the absurdity of it.
[02:42:15.316 --> 02:42:20.259]  Well yeah, and that's how they got into this position in the first place, you know, in decades past.
[02:42:20.999 --> 02:42:32.987]  Even if you disagreed with them on a, you know, for example, a fiscally conservative level, leftists would still be able to at least pose as if they were taking the moral high ground, which gave them this kind of credence.
[02:42:33.527 --> 02:42:42.711]  When it came to making these compassionate arguments about how society should run and how we should look after the less fortunate members of society.
[02:42:43.171 --> 02:42:55.275]  But now in 2015, they've abused that moral high ground to such an extent that, again, it's becoming the mainstreaming of lunacy and scratched beneath the surface just a little.
[02:42:55.595 --> 02:42:58.076]  For example, this, you know, air conditioning is sexist.
[02:42:58.537 --> 02:43:01.498]  If this was part of a huge patriarchal conspiracy,
[02:43:02.403 --> 02:43:09.468]  Then wouldn't men want to make women wear less clothes in the office if they were sexist?
[02:43:10.088 --> 02:43:14.531]  Of course they would have the air conditioning low, it would be really warm, it would be hot in the office.
[02:43:15.072 --> 02:43:16.733]  Women would wear less clothes.
[02:43:16.893 --> 02:43:21.136]  That would obviously appeal to the inherently misogynistic man, right?
[02:43:21.176 --> 02:43:30.002]  But no, of course it'd make no sense whatsoever when you analyze it for two minutes, but, you know, logic is not the strong point of radical feminists.
[02:43:30.282 --> 02:43:30.723]  That's true.
[02:43:31.579 --> 02:43:39.268]  Now, you know, that first report we're talking about that Mark Dice had where they're talking about, yeah, let's raise the taxes on guys because I'm not a guy.
[02:43:40.570 --> 02:43:41.111]  There was another...
[02:43:42.173 --> 02:43:42.694]  I think so.
[02:44:03.377 --> 02:44:09.041]  They're looking at genetically modified humans, people with implants, people they call superhumans.
[02:44:09.081 --> 02:44:11.022]  That's one aspect of it that is very troubling.
[02:44:11.062 --> 02:44:21.229]  But the other aspect of it that is very, very troubling is the degree of autonomy that they're going to give to drones, to robots on the ground.
[02:44:21.409 --> 02:44:22.670]  That is very disturbing.
[02:44:22.710 --> 02:44:29.655]  And of course, they see that as a given trend because they say people simply aren't going to be able to react quickly enough.
[02:44:30.035 --> 02:44:34.219]  People are getting accustomed to automated robots everywhere.
[02:44:34.239 --> 02:44:35.941]  They're going to become more and more accustomed to this.
[02:44:35.981 --> 02:44:37.242]  They're going to accept it.
[02:44:37.683 --> 02:44:41.827]  This I see as one of the key dangers confronting us.
[02:44:41.867 --> 02:44:46.392]  There's many things that are coming up out of the military-industrial complex.
[02:44:47.072 --> 02:44:57.262]  Owning research, owning science, and they are coming up with one technology after the other that has the capability of inflicting gigadeth on the human population.
[02:44:57.282 --> 02:44:58.984]  But of course, one of these is killer robots.
[02:44:59.004 --> 02:45:02.848]  Talk about what's happening in the UK in response to killer robots.
[02:45:04.005 --> 02:45:14.987]  Yeah, and again, this is the kind of issue, real issue, real threat to humanity that gets lost and buried amongst all this fluff about, you know, Caitlyn Jenner or Bill Cosby or whatever.
[02:45:15.447 --> 02:45:27.710]  And it's the fact that today, these experts, thousands of scientists have signed a letter, again, calling for a ban on autonomous killer robots, including Professor Stephen Hawking.
[02:45:28.470 --> 02:45:38.910]  Because they say that one day they could be used to carry out mechanised mass slaughter and even ethnic cleansing campaigns if the technology...
[02:45:40.046 --> 02:45:42.568]  You know, is abused by dictators and terrorists.
[02:45:43.048 --> 02:46:01.180]  What they don't mention is what we've talked about for years, and in fact, what the Pentagon talked about in a 2008 request for contractors, where they called for the development of robots to search for and detect non-cooperative humans during pursuit and invasion scenarios.
[02:46:02.281 --> 02:46:11.495]  They're talking about using these robots, which are being developed by Boston Dynamics, now owned by Google, of course, for DARPA and the Pentagon.
[02:46:11.916 --> 02:46:17.204]  Those robots, including the most recent ones they unveiled, Spot and, before that, BigDog,
[02:46:17.825 --> 02:46:23.646]  were based around pursuing humans in these evasion pursuit scenarios.
[02:46:23.706 --> 02:46:37.150]  So now you fast forward that and consider the fact that the Pentagon now wants a quarter of its battlefield troops to be robots within the next 10-20 years and of course that becomes the major threat.
[02:46:37.230 --> 02:46:38.130]  Our own governments
[02:46:38.750 --> 02:46:54.885]  Using this on a grand mechanized scale, and that process getting out of hand because of the ethical considerations tied to robots, who of course are more likely to kill, less likely to hesitate when it comes to killing large numbers of people.
[02:46:55.505 --> 02:46:59.368]  Yeah, and as I was going to tell you, I forgot to go back and make that correlation.
[02:46:59.388 --> 02:47:02.771]  So I was saying, you know, people are always in favor of raising taxes on others.
[02:47:03.231 --> 02:47:08.435]  They're also in favor of using preemptive strikes on other groups.
[02:47:08.656 --> 02:47:18.944]  And when we look at the push that has just come out in the last couple of weeks from Mike McCaul, where he wants to create a violent extremism department within Homeland Security, putting it under FEMA.
[02:47:19.484 --> 02:47:24.951]  At the same time, we see Wesley Clark saying, yeah, people can express their disloyalty to the United States.
[02:47:25.031 --> 02:47:25.892]  That's their right.
[02:47:26.312 --> 02:47:35.703]  We have a right to segregate those people for the duration of the conflict, meaning the war on terror, which will never go away because there's no defined enemies.
[02:47:35.943 --> 02:47:37.144]  But everybody seems to think
[02:47:37.905 --> 02:47:39.126]  This is going to be the other guy.
[02:47:39.186 --> 02:47:43.629]  This is something for the foreigner, something for the Islamic Jihadists.
[02:47:44.089 --> 02:47:51.874]  But we can see with the shooting that happened last week, we can see with the scenarios over and over again, that that's not what they're looking for.
[02:47:51.914 --> 02:47:53.915]  As a matter of fact, in response to Mike McCaul's bill,
[02:47:54.395 --> 02:47:55.636]  I just covered it yesterday.
[02:47:56.617 --> 02:48:03.021]  One of the people who was analyzing it said, yeah, in order for this to work, we need to understand that we've been focusing too narrowly on Muslims.
[02:48:03.061 --> 02:48:04.462]  They're not the real problem.
[02:48:04.522 --> 02:48:07.964]  They're not the real problem with homegrown violent extremism.
[02:48:08.024 --> 02:48:11.026]  It's all these other people who don't like the government.
[02:48:11.066 --> 02:48:14.629]  And so that's where this stuff is essentially going to be leading, Paul.
[02:48:16.015 --> 02:48:25.722]  Well that's right, and we've had reports where Homeland Security has given Muslim Brotherhood terrorists the red carpet when they're travelling through US airports.
[02:48:25.762 --> 02:48:35.910]  They consistently elevate the threat of homegrown extremists above that of radical terrorists, who of course we're creating through our foreign policy.
[02:48:36.410 --> 02:48:37.891]  In fact, today it was revealed that
[02:48:38.772 --> 02:48:46.897]  Obama gave Turkey the green light to bomb the Kurds who are actually fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
[02:48:46.957 --> 02:48:50.499]  So again, the growth of ISIS continues.
[02:48:50.519 --> 02:48:53.040]  We've got these bizarre weapons drops that keep happening.
[02:48:53.421 --> 02:48:56.102]  And yet they say that the biggest threat is homegrown terrorism.
[02:48:56.643 --> 02:49:00.045]  And you tie that back again to this development of killer robots.
[02:49:00.105 --> 02:49:00.405]  In fact,
[02:49:01.542 --> 02:49:17.290]  I quoted in the article the new scientist Paul Marks who responded to the Pentagon request for contractors to build these search and detect robots by saying, how long before we see packs of droids hunting down pesky demonstrators with paralyzing weapons?
[02:49:17.931 --> 02:49:20.232]  Or could the packs even be lethally armed?
[02:49:20.292 --> 02:49:27.736]  So you've got, you know, these drones already armed with tasers that police departments across the country are considering using.
[02:49:28.564 --> 02:49:45.194]  You've got the federal government identifying homegrown extremists as the terror threat, and you've got the convergence of this technology, where these hunting robots will be used to corral potentially dissidents and demonstrators over the next 5, 10, 15 years.
[02:49:45.574 --> 02:49:47.395]  So that's the biggest threat as I see it.
[02:49:47.795 --> 02:49:53.679]  Yes, from terrorists and dictators, but mainly from our own government, because that's where all this technology is coming from.
[02:49:54.319 --> 02:49:59.646]  It's very frightening, and there seems to be no awareness of the public as to where this is all heading.
[02:49:59.666 --> 02:50:05.913]  I mean, people need to go back and look at the fundamental premise of Jurassic Park, for example.
[02:50:05.954 --> 02:50:08.637]  It's very clear when you read the novel.
[02:50:08.717 --> 02:50:10.099]  It's even clear in the movie.
[02:50:10.379 --> 02:50:13.383]  The movie screenplay was written by the author of the book, Michael Crichton.
[02:50:13.863 --> 02:50:17.365]  And he makes it very clear that people don't see the bigger problem.
[02:50:17.405 --> 02:50:21.428]  This is particularly true of the engineers and scientists who are looking at this.
[02:50:21.488 --> 02:50:24.590]  They don't have a big picture view.
[02:50:24.630 --> 02:50:32.416]  They aren't concerned about what's the consequences for all of society or how this is going to be used by a small number of people.
[02:50:32.436 --> 02:50:35.938]  You're talking about swarms of robots, Paul, being used against protesters.
[02:50:36.198 --> 02:50:39.541]  That's one of the key things when they visualize the battlefield in the year 2050.
[02:50:40.101 --> 02:50:42.863]  They're talking about swarms of robots.
[02:50:43.243 --> 02:50:57.609]  And they're talking about how virtually the entire battle will be done by autonomous killing machines, as well as robots that are controlled by superhumans that have been genetically modified that are directly connected to these robots.
[02:50:57.789 --> 02:50:59.549]  A small number of people.
[02:50:59.909 --> 02:51:01.330]  A small Praetorian Guard.
[02:51:01.350 --> 02:51:02.851]  A very frightening possibility.
[02:51:03.231 --> 02:51:03.571]  Stay with us.
[02:51:03.591 --> 02:51:07.152]  We'll be right back to talk to Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[02:51:07.312 --> 02:51:08.753]  More about killer robots.

[02:52:22.020 --> 02:52:38.734]  We have rejected, literally, hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality, or because they're not 100% organic, or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:52:38.874 --> 02:52:49.763]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine, or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder, I believe,
[02:52:49.943 --> 02:52:50.483]  We're good.
[02:53:09.059 --> 02:53:18.327]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:53:18.367 --> 02:53:19.107]  This capitalism?
[02:53:19.167 --> 02:53:25.272]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:53:25.332 --> 02:53:28.975]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[02:53:59.650 --> 02:54:00.490]  Liberty HealthShare.
[02:54:00.570 --> 02:54:01.411]  Together, we are one.
[02:54:17.651 --> 02:54:18.952]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:18.992 --> 02:54:20.033]  I'm David Knight in Austin.
[02:54:20.073 --> 02:54:22.495]  Joining us from the UK is Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:54:22.515 --> 02:54:26.898]  Now the founders of this country understood the dangers of a standing army.
[02:54:27.438 --> 02:54:33.503]  Madison specifically warned us that the means of defense abroad would become instruments of tyranny at home.
[02:54:34.143 --> 02:54:37.786]  Eisenhower warned us about the military-industrial complex, about the Defense Department.
[02:54:38.712 --> 02:54:44.337]  Making it a business, taking over scientific research, taking over the university's research.
[02:54:44.558 --> 02:54:54.387]  More specifically now, we are seeing specific technologies that many scientists have flagged as something that could cause massive death.
[02:54:54.687 --> 02:54:57.129]  Giga death, as Hugo de Geras talks about it.
[02:54:57.149 --> 02:54:58.591]  We had him on interviewing him about
[02:54:59.031 --> 02:55:07.962]  The dangers inherent in general artificial intelligence but of course specific artificial intelligence in terms of killer robots was something else that he was very concerned about.
[02:55:08.182 --> 02:55:13.528]  We've talked to Noel Sharkey about the organization that campaigned to stop killer robots.
[02:55:14.545 --> 02:55:38.282]  And Stephen Hawkins has come out against that, and we've just been talking to Paul Joseph Watson of the UK about how the UK is opposing a massive movement by scientists who do see the big picture, who are concerned about this runaway technology and the consequences it could have, but the UK is opposing it just like people here in the US, the defense industry in the US, because they're very closely linked.
[02:55:38.642 --> 02:55:39.503]  We see, Paul, that
[02:55:40.123 --> 02:55:43.866]  Of course, the United States, we have more than half of the worldwide defense spending.
[02:55:43.906 --> 02:55:48.770]  In other words, put it another way, we spend more than all the rest of the countries combined.
[02:55:48.830 --> 02:55:56.417]  And one of the things that pulls us into it is this fear that the other side, whoever that other side may be in their scenario, that the other side
[02:55:56.997 --> 02:56:00.881]  It's going to get some technology and we're going to be at a loss of that.
[02:56:00.901 --> 02:56:03.743]  So we have to get that technology, that lethal technology before them.
[02:56:03.763 --> 02:56:10.729]  So we create all these things like killer robots, like select biological agents with a gain of function to make them more deadly, easier to catch.
[02:56:10.990 --> 02:56:14.273]  I mean, this is an insane race over the cliff, Paul.
[02:56:15.933 --> 02:56:17.314]  Yeah, and that's what they're warning about.
[02:56:17.354 --> 02:56:24.420]  They're saying that this is going to create a killer robot arms race between the United States and countries like Russia and China.
[02:56:24.901 --> 02:56:27.943]  And you were talking about the prominent voices that were warning against it.
[02:56:28.344 --> 02:56:35.390]  We had an article a couple of years ago about an essay by Colonel Douglas Pryor, who was in US military intelligence.
[02:56:36.010 --> 02:56:38.553]  He talked about drones and he made the comparison that
[02:56:39.639 --> 02:56:48.528]  These robots that they're developing today for DARPA, these killer robots, quote, make today's predators and reapers look positively impotent and antique.
[02:56:49.189 --> 02:56:53.173]  These killer robots will share one thing in common with their primitive progenitors.
[02:56:53.573 --> 02:57:00.660]  With remorseless purpose, they will stalk and kill any human deemed a legitimate target by their controllers and programmers.
[02:57:01.661 --> 02:57:05.884]  You've got prominent voices within the US military complex itself warning about that.
[02:57:06.304 --> 02:57:28.017]  And of course, because they're merely programmed to kill, similar to the drone program, the deaths of innocents, the responsibility for that will be diffused because there's no human who can be directly blamed for the bloodshed, which is also an advantage if you're engaged in this kind of mechanized mass killing, because you can't put a face to the crime.
[02:57:28.037 --> 02:57:30.158]  You can't find a specific victim.
[02:57:30.638 --> 02:57:31.940]  Yeah, it's just a software error.
[02:57:31.960 --> 02:57:33.623]  Just the program went off.
[02:57:33.683 --> 02:57:34.904]  I didn't do it deliberately.
[02:57:34.965 --> 02:57:36.347]  We just put that there and it went crazy.
[02:57:37.827 --> 02:57:40.449]  Yeah, and again, you can just blame the technology.
[02:57:40.589 --> 02:57:44.471]  You know, a robot is less likely to value collateral damage as well.
[02:57:44.511 --> 02:57:52.696]  It's like those Google self-driving cars where they may kill you to save a child under that 1984-style scenario.
[02:57:52.736 --> 02:57:59.520]  So, they're more likely to not be sensitive to collateral damage, which of course is going to end up with more innocent people dying.
[02:57:59.980 --> 02:58:00.601]  We already have
[02:58:01.582 --> 02:58:15.737]  50 innocent people killed on average for every terrorist killed by a drone strike, and that's only going to be replicated and amplified if these killer robots, as the Pentagon have called for, become 25% of the U.S.
[02:58:15.817 --> 02:58:19.501]  Army's battlefield forces within the next couple of decades.
[02:58:20.181 --> 02:58:20.622]  Amazing.
[02:58:20.902 --> 02:58:22.223]  Very, very frightening.
[02:58:22.263 --> 02:58:31.629]  And, of course, this report, and we'll talk more about this report tomorrow, talking about superhumans, micro-targeting, force fields, directed energy weapons.
[02:58:31.709 --> 02:58:33.531]  This is a nightmare scenario.
[02:58:33.611 --> 02:58:36.233]  This is what you're buying with your taxpayer dollars.
[02:58:36.273 --> 02:58:37.313]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:58:37.734 --> 02:58:38.694]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:58:38.975 --> 02:58:41.917]  Tune in tonight, Nightly News, 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[02:58:41.977 --> 02:58:42.257]  Eastern.
[02:58:52.299 --> 02:58:56.268]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
