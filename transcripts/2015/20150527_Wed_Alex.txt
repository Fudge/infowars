[00:00:05.748 --> 00:00:06.409]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:08.090]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:09.931]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:11.392]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.173 --> 00:00:13.073]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:17.356]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:21.960]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:26.528]  Secret meeting in London to end cash globally.
[00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:28.249]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.775]  We've got huge reports on Fukushima saying containers could lead to hydrogen explosion.
[00:00:35.815 --> 00:00:36.736]  That's RT.
[00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:41.700]  We've got this whole new soccer indictment globally with the FBI.
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.881]  We'll break all that down.
[00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:51.188]  But first, here's Obama, candidate Obama, debating President Obama on warrantless wiretapping and Big Brother spying.
[00:00:52.244 --> 00:00:54.045]  The separation of powers works.
[00:00:54.505 --> 00:00:56.066]  Our Constitution works.
[00:00:57.026 --> 00:01:04.590]  We will again set an example for the world that the law is not subject to the whims of stubborn rulers and that justice is not arbitrary.
[00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:10.353]  This administration acts like violating civil liberties is the way to enhance our security.
[00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:10.933]  It is not.
[00:01:11.974 --> 00:01:14.035]  There are no shortcuts to protecting America.
[00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:20.698]  But my assessment and my team's assessment was that
[00:01:21.812 --> 00:01:25.034]  They help us prevent terrorist attacks.
[00:01:26.055 --> 00:01:32.139]  This administration also puts forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we provide.
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:44.048]  You can't have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience.
[00:01:48.197 --> 00:01:52.340]  We're going to have to make some choices as a society.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:02.765]  I will provide our intelligence and law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to track and take out the terrorists without undermining our Constitution and our freedom.
[00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:06.447]  That means no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens.
[00:02:07.308 --> 00:02:11.810]  No more national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime.
[00:02:12.671 --> 00:02:16.573]  No more tracking citizens who do nothing more than protest a misguided war.
[00:02:17.506 --> 00:02:19.827]  No more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient.
[00:02:20.887 --> 00:02:21.908]  That is not who we are.
[00:02:21.928 --> 00:02:25.589]  And it's not what is necessary to defeat the terrorists.
[00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:38.533]  And what I can say is that in evaluating these programs, they make a difference in our capacity to anticipate and prevent possible terrorist activity.
[00:02:39.434 --> 00:02:46.216]  In the abstract, you can complain about Big Brother and how this is a potential
[00:02:48.323 --> 00:02:53.025]  You know, program run amok.
[00:02:54.025 --> 00:02:58.007]  But when you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance.
[00:02:58.627 --> 00:02:59.787]  Incredible deception.
[00:02:59.827 --> 00:03:00.728]  But we got good news.
[00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:06.290]  Kylie Jenner, with her 10 million mindless followers, is now worried about chemtrails.
[00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.691]  There could be hope.
[00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:08.711]  Here's Leanne's report.
[00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:11.042]  I'm going to call this a victory.
[00:03:11.062 --> 00:03:23.332]  I would like to point out, Kylie Jenner, yes, of the Kardashian family clan, tweeted out to her 10 million plus followers a picture about geoengineering.
[00:03:23.612 --> 00:03:27.896]  And it's questioning, you know, what are these lines in the sky?
[00:03:27.976 --> 00:03:28.977]  Who's paying for this?
[00:03:29.057 --> 00:03:30.098]  Why is it happening?
[00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:32.560]  Click on that picture and make it bigger so people can see.
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.203]  You know, why do I have to see these when I'm on my way to work?
[00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:40.485]  How is it going to affect our health and our children's future?
[00:03:41.226 --> 00:03:59.879]  So I don't normally care about the vapid Kardashian clan and how they have zombies of the world enthralled, but Kylie Jenner tweeted this out to her 10 million plus followers, so I can guarantee there was a collective neck bending by the zombies of...
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:18.671]  So, even if it was only 5% of the people who are following her on Twitter who actually cranked their necks to look up, that's still 500,000 people who are now conscious and aware of chemtrails who might ask their neighbor, hey, what is that?
[00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:26.836]  Just a very, very small shift in the collective consciousness of humanity that we need to see sweeping change.
[00:04:31.158 --> 00:04:35.659]  That is Leanne McAdoo's excerpt from the nightly news last night.
[00:04:36.019 --> 00:04:42.600]  And it's a big deal to be able to reach the zombies like this and that folks are beginning to research geoengineering.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.321]  So maybe Kylie Jenner is really smart and knows what's going on.
[00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:48.941]  That is certainly exciting.
[00:04:49.782 --> 00:04:56.523]  We'll be back with over-the-top important news across the spectrum on this live Wednesday Global Transmission.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.341]  Self-driving car.
[00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:04.803]  The future doesn't need it.
[00:05:06.304 --> 00:05:08.066]  The future doesn't even like us.
[00:05:08.947 --> 00:05:15.212]  With journalists assembled and offering themselves as human pylons, a self-driving Volvo went full-on Christine.
[00:05:15.492 --> 00:05:20.096]  Accelerating from a distance, it plowed into the journalist who trusted it.
[00:05:20.777 --> 00:05:24.220]  Volvo first said they hadn't purchased the pedestrian avoidance option.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.641]  That's an option?
[00:05:26.362 --> 00:05:28.984]  Did they go for the cheaper vehicular manslaughter option?
[00:05:31.545 --> 00:05:37.771]  Then Volvo changed their story and said it was the fault of the owner who failed to activate safety mode.
[00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:44.016]  As we look at the people who failed to move, I ask, would you put your life in the hands of a self-driving car?
[00:05:44.617 --> 00:05:45.898]  You will if you ride in one.
[00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:51.743]  Of course, no accident will ever be the fault of the self-driving car.
[00:05:52.604 --> 00:05:52.864]  Right.
[00:05:53.184 --> 00:05:55.146]  See the video at Infowars.com.
[00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:56.207]  I'm David Knight.
[00:05:59.394 --> 00:06:00.275]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[00:06:00.335 --> 00:06:00.755]  Good, brother.
[00:06:00.896 --> 00:06:02.577]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:06:02.617 --> 00:06:04.399]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.584]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:06:08.604 --> 00:06:11.187]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:06:11.227 --> 00:06:13.489]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:21.518]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:06:21.698 --> 00:06:24.922]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:06:25.062 --> 00:06:26.544]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:06:26.584 --> 00:06:29.487]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:06:29.648 --> 00:06:31.009]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:36.596]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:38.938]  Concentrated or maximum potency.
[00:06:39.138 --> 00:06:51.087]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while But then burn you out in my experience where stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[00:06:51.127 --> 00:06:58.093]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.660]  Another major health threat.
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.582]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:07:05.662 --> 00:07:08.303]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:07:08.343 --> 00:07:15.125]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:07:15.385 --> 00:07:18.246]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:07:18.366 --> 00:07:21.327]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:23.327]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:07:23.347 --> 00:07:26.208]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:07:26.288 --> 00:07:31.791]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:07:31.991 --> 00:07:35.494]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:07:35.514 --> 00:07:38.475]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:07:38.595 --> 00:07:42.878]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.
[00:07:43.018 --> 00:07:45.699]  For every modern, independently minded household.
[00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:48.981]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[00:07:55.563 --> 00:07:56.043]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:56.063 --> 00:08:06.308]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:08:06.448 --> 00:08:08.649]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.828 --> 00:08:30.149]  I gotta tell you right now, it's another one of those days.
[00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:33.929]  It just gets crazier every single week, every month, every year.
[00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:41.231]  There is just an overload of incredible news and information and it all ties together.
[00:08:42.771 --> 00:08:49.873]  The incredibly corrupt Justice Department, that is villainous even by third world standards,
[00:08:52.827 --> 00:09:03.632]  That is tyrannical, that targets its political enemies openly, nakedly, that ships guns into Mexico to destabilize that country, create mass murder and demonize the Second Amendment.
[00:09:04.292 --> 00:09:11.955]  The group that's been involved in persecuting Christian organizations and sicking the IRS on their political enemies, arresting filmmakers.
[00:09:13.756 --> 00:09:15.877]  This group is now globally
[00:09:18.109 --> 00:09:26.837]  Going after the world sport, the FIFA, that sit over international soccer, the World Cup, you name it.
[00:09:28.438 --> 00:09:31.381]  And no doubt there's some corruption in the World Cup.
[00:09:32.682 --> 00:09:35.845]  No doubt there is corruption in every major sport.
[00:09:35.945 --> 00:09:44.973]  But you can't have Hitler or Stalin or Jim Jones or Jeffrey Dahmer or John Wayne Gacy
[00:09:46.670 --> 00:10:00.760]  Or Attelo the Hun, or Genghis Khan, or Caligula, or Fidel Castro, sit in judgment like Loretta Lynch's Justice Department is doing.
[00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:06.784]  They have launched a full-bore offensive against the FIFA.
[00:10:08.666 --> 00:10:14.350]  The department unleashed a 47-count indictment Wednesday against 14 international soccer officials.
[00:10:15.592 --> 00:10:22.736]  You talk about grandstanding and a huge political diversion from all of the corruption of this Justice Department.
[00:10:23.197 --> 00:10:30.461]  This is like Satan saying he's going to investigate a bootlegger that's selling whiskey out his back porch.
[00:10:32.162 --> 00:10:33.903]  I mean, it's just too much.
[00:10:35.264 --> 00:10:42.809]  This is the same Justice Department that won't do anything about rigging the gold and silver market with naked shorts, put options,
[00:10:44.025 --> 00:10:53.071]  This is the same Justice Department that won't go after the NFL with its unparalleled corruption and the incredible corruption of basketball, baseball.
[00:10:53.151 --> 00:10:54.852]  I mean, it's joke level.
[00:10:57.734 --> 00:11:00.275]  How corrupt our Olympic team is, all of it.
[00:11:00.795 --> 00:11:02.937]  People talk about the Russians cheating, of course they cheat.
[00:11:03.197 --> 00:11:04.618]  The United States cheats even worse.
[00:11:04.938 --> 00:11:06.299]  We're the best at cheating, probably.
[00:11:08.649 --> 00:11:22.294]  And it's to sit there with their finger pointed out when they are the worst of the worst of the worst, when they are shutting down selectively our power plants, allowing Obama to give thousands of waivers to companies to not follow Obamacare when everybody else has to.
[00:11:22.574 --> 00:11:28.716]  I mean, classical picking winners, classical big city mafia machine activity.
[00:11:28.956 --> 00:11:35.439]  I mean, you want to live in Chicago, you want to live in New York City, you want to live in D.C., baby, this is that type of
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.441]  Corrupt government system writ large.
[00:11:43.363 --> 00:11:45.804]  And while we have this going on, they're trying to start war with Russia.
[00:11:45.844 --> 00:11:48.625]  There's more on that we're going to be getting to, but here it is in the New York Times.
[00:11:49.466 --> 00:11:54.288]  FIFA officials arrested on corruption charges.
[00:11:55.369 --> 00:11:57.330]  And the Swiss are involved investigating as well.
[00:11:59.891 --> 00:12:01.572]  Sepp Blatter isn't among them.
[00:12:03.272 --> 00:12:04.293]  This would be like if they arrested
[00:12:05.515 --> 00:12:07.496]  All the heads of the NFL, the owners.
[00:12:07.596 --> 00:12:09.237]  I mean, this is, this is chilling.
[00:12:09.257 --> 00:12:11.598]  They can get away with anything, folks.
[00:12:12.819 --> 00:12:16.840]  FIFA officials corrupted football, U.S.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:17.641]  officials say.
[00:12:17.661 --> 00:12:19.902]  Of course, they call it football worldwide, not soccer.
[00:12:22.813 --> 00:12:27.036]  Wall Street gets slammed with $5.8 billion in fines for rate rigging.
[00:12:27.536 --> 00:12:28.937]  Sounds like she did a good job?
[00:12:29.737 --> 00:12:35.821]  Wall Street makes hundreds of billions a day in many cases, tens of billions every day off rigging the rates.
[00:12:36.282 --> 00:12:39.764]  Everyone should be going to jail instead of $5.8 billion in fines.
[00:12:41.365 --> 00:12:43.666]  So my point is, we've got stuff that affects everybody.
[00:12:44.607 --> 00:12:49.390]  Rigging interest rates, rigging currency trading, rigging the stock market with high-frequency trading.
[00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.132]  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase are the leaders.
[00:12:53.425 --> 00:12:56.427]  And they're the biggest financers of these administrations.
[00:12:57.088 --> 00:12:57.728]  Understand that.
[00:12:57.788 --> 00:13:06.615]  They're the ones paying for open borders, paying for the TPP, paying to go after our guns, paying to persecute the church in this country.
[00:13:11.859 --> 00:13:19.825]  Now, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, that dovetails with this article
[00:13:21.252 --> 00:13:30.659]  On Infowars.com, this Bloomberg story, six banks pay 5.8 billion, five guilty of market rigging.
[00:13:31.219 --> 00:13:45.309]  The essence of tyranny is when the elite selectively enforce the law and put people in jail for crooked toenails while they basically sacrifice children on the temple's front lawn.
[00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.512]  Secret meeting in London to end cash.
[00:13:50.152 --> 00:13:52.294]  InfoWars.com, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:13:52.794 --> 00:13:59.779]  General Obama isn't going after this, are they?
[00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:02.120]  No, because they're run by these very same groups.
[00:14:02.521 --> 00:14:04.162]  His Attorney General won't say a word.
[00:14:04.602 --> 00:14:06.283]  Secret meeting in London to end cash.
[00:14:06.303 --> 00:14:08.325]  Central Bank's aim to institute, quote,
[00:14:09.522 --> 00:14:29.660]  Governmental approval for all purchases and sales, to shut down farmers markets, to shut down underground economies, that you'll need to survive during a global cloud and pivot, artificial implosion, a great leap forward, a cultural revolution, to domesticate you, to end normal, independent, local commerce.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.861]  That's what communists always do.
[00:14:32.221 --> 00:14:33.921]  That's what fascists always do.
[00:14:34.241 --> 00:14:36.182]  That's what totalitarians always do.
[00:14:36.462 --> 00:14:40.483]  The old name for it is serfdom, feudalism, slavery.
[00:14:42.024 --> 00:14:46.065]  You think serfs could run businesses on their own before the Renaissance in Europe?
[00:14:46.465 --> 00:14:49.686]  You think serfs could run businesses in Japan outside of government approval?
[00:14:50.691 --> 00:15:05.178]  Do you think, without the show guns, okay, do you think in any culture, from ancient Africa to ancient China, from the ancient Middle East to ancient Mesoamerica, do you think anybody could have any type of business or operation that wasn't certified and approved?
[00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:08.980]  No, no, no, no.
[00:15:11.401 --> 00:15:13.462]  Economist Martin Armstrong.
[00:15:14.588 --> 00:15:21.590]  Claims there is a secret meeting to end cash that will take place in London before the end of the month involving representatives of the ECB and the Federal Reserve.
[00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:29.712]  Well, the ECB, the Federal Reserve, the head of Citigroup, the head of Goldman Sachs, the head of Bank of America, the head of Wells Fargo, they've all been in the news.
[00:15:29.852 --> 00:15:32.013]  JPMorgan Chase saying, end cash.
[00:15:33.353 --> 00:15:40.735]  They already tracked it with the digital numbers on it, and the little monofilament line that's in there, the little tape,
[00:15:41.681 --> 00:15:47.206]  That's got all the history of where the money goes and who has it and where you got it out and who got it and where it got deposited again later.
[00:15:48.787 --> 00:16:03.339]  Armstrong, who is known for successfully predicting the 87 Black Monday crash, I want to get him on, guys, as well as the 1998 Russian financial collapse, expressed his shock that no news outlet had reported on this upcoming conference.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.163]  It's just like Bilderberg or Bilderberg steering group meetings.
[00:16:10.416 --> 00:16:13.984]  In fact, you can bet that this meeting is preceding the Bilderberg Group.
[00:16:14.004 --> 00:16:15.488]  They always have key meetings right before it.
[00:16:15.909 --> 00:16:17.512]  And they got the final vote at Bilderberg.
[00:16:19.488 --> 00:16:24.313]  I find it extremely perplexing that I have been the only one to report on the secret meeting in London.
[00:16:24.854 --> 00:16:40.090]  Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University and William Booter, Chief Economist at Citigroup, will address the central banks to advocate the elimination of cash to bring to fruition the day when we cannot buy or sell anything without government approval, writes Armstrong.
[00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:47.576]  When I googled the issue to see who else had picked it up, to my surprise, Armstrong Economics comes up first.
[00:16:48.076 --> 00:17:01.687]  Others are quoting me, but I even find it spreading as far as the Central Bank of Nigeria, but I have yet to find any reports on the meeting taking place in London when my sources are direct.
[00:17:03.488 --> 00:17:10.694]  Once all money exists only in bank accounts monitored or even directly controlled by the government, the authorities will be able to encourage us to spend more money
[00:17:11.633 --> 00:17:14.134]  When the economy slows or spend less when it's overheating.
[00:17:14.494 --> 00:17:20.716]  That was a quote by one of the chief bankers who will be addressing the meeting, Kenneth Rogoff.
[00:17:22.956 --> 00:17:27.018]  Wrote an article, we covered this article two weeks ago, it was in the news, in the Financial Times.
[00:17:27.138 --> 00:17:31.479]  Abolishing physical currency in order to stop tax evasion and illegal activity.
[00:17:31.839 --> 00:17:40.542]  This is by the very banks rigging the markets, rigging the interest rates, rigging the currency speculation, rigging everything.
[00:17:41.889 --> 00:17:44.351]  These are the big banks caught laundering the drug money.
[00:17:44.811 --> 00:17:48.153]  Caught owning the aircraft and leasing the aircraft to fly the drugs.
[00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:50.355]  Caught running the entire show.
[00:17:51.776 --> 00:17:54.618]  And they're the ones that want to charge you to have deposits.
[00:17:54.658 --> 00:17:57.620]  Well, you're like, I'll just keep my money in my basement.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.381]  No, you won't.
[00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:05.205]  Because it'll be in their hands so they can start doing the bail-ins.
[00:18:06.246 --> 00:18:08.767]  Like they're now starting to do in Greece, they've already done in other countries.
[00:18:09.848 --> 00:18:10.409]  Like Cyprus.
[00:18:11.442 --> 00:18:16.246]  Where they just take whatever they want with government approval, of course, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:16.686 --> 00:18:19.028]  Always with government approval.
[00:18:21.711 --> 00:18:24.793]  So this is how they do it, over and over and over again.
[00:18:25.254 --> 00:18:28.456]  They're making their move on every single front.
[00:18:30.578 --> 00:18:35.422]  Yeah, I don't care, but see, the light's on camera two, but I'm on camera one.
[00:18:35.442 --> 00:18:38.405]  I mean, I don't care, it just gets confusing.
[00:18:40.059 --> 00:18:46.423]  I'll try to figure that out though someday, because sometimes it's red lights, sometimes it's green lights, sometimes it's no lights on these cameras.
[00:18:46.764 --> 00:18:49.886]  And whenever I was in other TV studios, it's just a red light when it's on.
[00:18:50.326 --> 00:18:51.948]  And then you just know the camera you're on.
[00:18:52.928 --> 00:18:53.469]  Side issue.
[00:18:53.649 --> 00:18:55.530]  Just side issue.
[00:18:58.112 --> 00:19:02.516]  We're going to go to break and come back and cover the news, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:02.956 --> 00:19:03.977]  There's a lot more of it.
[00:19:05.472 --> 00:19:08.394]  You just tuned in on the radio and you go, what's he talking about cameras and lights?
[00:19:08.754 --> 00:19:10.515]  We simulcast television here.
[00:19:10.535 --> 00:19:12.457]  It's teleprompter free.
[00:19:12.517 --> 00:19:14.918]  It's just real analysis, hardcore info.
[00:19:15.458 --> 00:19:17.580]  Elites are digging in, building bunkers everywhere.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.640]  We have more news on that.
[00:19:19.501 --> 00:19:24.064]  Arming themselves against the public while doing everything they can to implode the economy and create the crisis.
[00:19:25.485 --> 00:19:26.385]  You say, why would they do that?
[00:19:26.446 --> 00:19:31.389]  Because you have to have a global meltdown, an economic war to bring in their total power.
[00:19:32.506 --> 00:19:35.929]  You gotta break a few eggs to make an omelet, to quote Joseph Stalin.
[00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.092]  And boy, are they breaking some eggs right now.
[00:19:40.474 --> 00:19:44.577]  Alright, I'm Alex Jones of Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:19:44.818 --> 00:19:53.706]  They're coming in with internet censorship, free speech censorship, massive global taxes, dictatorial rule, huge new wars, total surveillance.
[00:19:54.287 --> 00:19:57.590]  This is those time in history we'll look back on and say, my God, why'd we let it happen?
[00:20:00.217 --> 00:20:05.880]  It's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the industry leader, My Patriot Supply.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:12.023]  Once you try them, you'll know why so many Americans like you have made them part of their emergency preparedness plan.

[00:20:59.617 --> 00:21:07.726]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website, InfoWars.com.
[00:21:08.046 --> 00:21:16.029]  Because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[00:21:16.249 --> 00:21:19.170]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:23.772]  Well then, about six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:21:24.012 --> 00:21:25.433]  Hdfirearms.com.
[00:21:25.713 --> 00:21:28.914]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, special ops people.

[00:21:44.862 --> 00:21:48.063]  You can pick it up at the gun show, you can pick it up at a local sporting goods store.
[00:21:48.223 --> 00:21:52.365]  Whatever you do, get your Head Down firearm today.

[00:21:59.369 --> 00:22:01.170]  Are you suffering from E.P.?
[00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.292]  The symptoms include fraudulent charges to your credit card.
[00:22:04.372 --> 00:22:06.733]  Your subway card says it's empty, but you bought it yesterday.
[00:22:06.993 --> 00:22:11.516]  Someone's been in your hotel room, but the desk clerk says they only show you entering the room.
[00:22:11.776 --> 00:22:13.277]  These are signs of E.P.
[00:22:13.557 --> 00:22:14.998]  Electronic pickpocketing.
[00:22:15.198 --> 00:22:18.040]  Payment cards, transit cards, even hotel room keys.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:23.483]  Use a radio chip so you can just wave your card at the register, the turnstile, or your hotel room door.
[00:22:23.643 --> 00:22:27.605]  But what's convenient for you is also convenient for thieves, waving scanners,
[00:22:27.845 --> 00:22:30.668]  To electronically pickpocket you without even touching you.
[00:22:30.928 --> 00:22:32.769]  The good news is there's a cure.
[00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:38.214]  ID Stronghold has created leather wallets and clutches that have built-in EP protection.

[00:23:01.792 --> 00:23:03.493]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?

[00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:57.671]  Come and take it.
[00:24:26.545 --> 00:24:48.403]  Whether it's James Bamford or William Benny, or Jonathan Turley, liberal constitutional lawyer, every expert across the board, including Steve Wozniak, Stephen Hawking, all of them, the inventor of the internet over in England,
[00:24:49.827 --> 00:24:51.909]  He's been going public, and no, it's not Al Gore.
[00:24:52.469 --> 00:25:01.136]  Basically, every day, I see prominent scientists and inventors that built our modern society.
[00:25:01.196 --> 00:25:02.037]  What's good about it?
[00:25:03.738 --> 00:25:07.281]  I see innovators saying, we're going into a total tyranny.
[00:25:08.322 --> 00:25:08.862]  Close quote.
[00:25:10.924 --> 00:25:14.507]  We now have the capability to live under a total tyranny with the NSA.
[00:25:14.627 --> 00:25:18.250]  James Bamford, quote, former head producer of Nightline.
[00:25:21.101 --> 00:25:23.763]  Who I interviewed 19 years ago about the NSA.
[00:25:27.605 --> 00:25:31.008]  What did Benny say to The Guardian and here in this studio?
[00:25:32.909 --> 00:25:37.612]  The NSA's goal is total control, total oppression.
[00:25:39.954 --> 00:25:40.774]  This is the goal.
[00:25:40.854 --> 00:25:47.839]  This is a giant illegal takeover and every other country is basically trying to duplicate what the elite in this country have done.
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.101]  The Internet of Things.
[00:25:52.711 --> 00:25:53.512]  Smart dust.
[00:25:55.193 --> 00:25:57.475]  Where everything has RFID chips in it.
[00:26:00.358 --> 00:26:08.224]  And is tracked in real time, not to stop crime, not to empower society, but to game economies to consolidate them.
[00:26:10.346 --> 00:26:18.273]  Two years ago, I was watching Davos, Switzerland meeting, basically a public Bilderberg meeting, where they admit about 90% of it, but put their spin on it.
[00:26:20.507 --> 00:26:27.572]  And they had all these world leaders up there going, we are now known as the technocrats, and the technotronic era has arrived.
[00:26:27.972 --> 00:26:29.273]  Quoting Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[00:26:30.293 --> 00:26:36.717]  Just type in, EU bureaucrats call themselves technocrats, and say they're building a technocracy.
[00:26:37.178 --> 00:26:41.721]  A technocracy is a technological tyranny, by definition.
[00:26:42.719 --> 00:26:50.324]  It is rule by unelected autocrats that control the population through data and gaming of data.
[00:26:51.084 --> 00:26:53.046]  What does Michael Bloomberg call himself?
[00:26:53.246 --> 00:26:53.906]  A technocrat.
[00:26:53.926 --> 00:26:54.306]  Look it up.
[00:26:54.367 --> 00:26:56.868]  Type in Michael Bloomberg, technocrat.
[00:26:59.009 --> 00:27:00.831]  And there's all these interviews with him where he's like,
[00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:03.930]  We have data on everything you do now.
[00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:05.651]  We know what you want to order before you order it.
[00:27:05.871 --> 00:27:13.696]  We're going to have a utopia with the elite, understanding with the numbers, how to run everything and create a perfect world.
[00:27:14.236 --> 00:27:25.542]  Their perfect world... Their perfect world, their system, where they have access to the data and you don't.
[00:27:27.684 --> 00:27:28.484]  A total tyranny.
[00:27:28.684 --> 00:27:29.865]  A total technocracy.
[00:27:31.741 --> 00:27:33.862]  And we just sit here seeing the whole thing roll out.
[00:27:34.202 --> 00:27:41.224]  They've gone from denying it to just rolling the whole thing out.
[00:27:41.464 --> 00:27:42.124]  There's The Guardian.
[00:27:42.484 --> 00:27:45.605]  The technocrats must be voted out at the European elections.
[00:27:46.166 --> 00:27:51.347]  Even mainline liberals like The Guardian are freaking out right now.
[00:27:51.727 --> 00:27:56.429]  There's another Guardian article out today how millions were spent just the last few weeks
[00:27:57.981 --> 00:28:11.144]  To buy off the members of the Senate that voted to not let the public read the TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and to give Obama the dictatorial power to make any agreement he wants with anybody on trade, period.
[00:28:11.544 --> 00:28:12.645]  Making him a dictator.
[00:28:15.045 --> 00:28:16.545]  No wonder there's armored vehicles.
[00:28:16.585 --> 00:28:18.066]  No wonder there's surveillance cameras.
[00:28:18.346 --> 00:28:22.447]  No wonder they're spying on us illegally and going after their political enemies.
[00:28:23.837 --> 00:28:25.798]  Because it's real, folks.
[00:28:26.159 --> 00:28:27.920]  They're going for broke.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.981]  They're going all the way.
[00:28:30.362 --> 00:28:31.182]  They've committed.
[00:28:32.323 --> 00:28:40.589]  It's like when you're in college, you see that beautiful, smart woman you've been seeing around the dorm or whatever, or at the gym, and you're going to go ahead and go over and hit on her.
[00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:49.676]  You're committed, and you walk over, and she turns towards you, and you've got to open your mouth, and you've got to see how charming you can be when you invite her out to dinner or to a movie or to go dancing.
[00:28:50.424 --> 00:28:52.765]  Well, the globalists aren't asking a nice girl out dancing.
[00:28:53.085 --> 00:28:56.605]  They've jumped off the high dive.
[00:28:56.646 --> 00:29:00.606]  They're going in, feet first on top of us, and they're committed!
[00:29:00.626 --> 00:29:09.969]  I mean, they're putting poison in the water, they're chemtrailing, they're building new reactors everywhere with even worse technology than 30 years ago, where they can just melt down.
[00:29:10.009 --> 00:29:19.151]  They don't care if reactors melt down, they don't care if GMO spreads and gets into the atmosphere and creates a blight, which they predict could happen, that the movie Interstellar is based on.
[00:29:20.888 --> 00:29:21.889]  They're demons, folks.
[00:29:21.989 --> 00:29:22.729]  They're dangerous.
[00:29:22.889 --> 00:29:31.673]  Anybody could study them and say, this is a group of megalomaniacal, power-tripping, crazy people who are going to destroy the planet.
[00:29:32.334 --> 00:29:33.514]  And they're starting war with Russia.
[00:29:33.694 --> 00:29:34.855]  They're starting war with China.
[00:29:35.315 --> 00:29:41.278]  They're waging war on just life itself.
[00:29:42.059 --> 00:29:46.901]  Because they see anything that's independent, from a plant growing on its own, to a family, as an enemy.
[00:29:47.461 --> 00:29:48.622]  They are total control freaks.
[00:29:49.127 --> 00:29:52.129]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:55.852]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.875 --> 00:30:08.162]  Wherever children can be found having good, clean fun, you can rest assured there's a control freak not far behind trying to ruin their childhood.
[00:30:08.542 --> 00:30:14.367]  As was the case in Pennsylvania, where a teen was ordered to tear down a treehouse because their neighbor complained.
[00:30:14.967 --> 00:30:20.569]  At first I thought it was a joke, but then I found out it wasn't, the teen said, according to local reports.
[00:30:21.009 --> 00:30:22.890]  So then I got really sad.
[00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:24.150]  And it is sad.
[00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:34.514]  People complain that teens spend too much time in front of their cell phones and video games, but when they go out and actually have physical activity, some people find that to be unacceptable.
[00:30:35.074 --> 00:30:41.296]  This was echoed earlier this year when a family was forced to remove a cardboard fort from their own front yard.
[00:30:42.076 --> 00:30:49.564]  I had warm, positive memories from my childhood about forts and thought it was a great way to spark imaginations away from the TV, the father said.
[00:30:50.485 --> 00:30:53.047]  But no, that also was unacceptable.
[00:30:53.668 --> 00:30:57.532]  You can find more reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:31:03.035 --> 00:31:12.419]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:31:12.759 --> 00:31:15.320]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:18.842]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:31:19.022 --> 00:31:25.045]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[00:31:25.345 --> 00:31:27.866]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[00:31:28.066 --> 00:31:30.207]  And then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[00:31:30.468 --> 00:31:36.652]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[00:31:36.852 --> 00:31:44.336]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[00:31:44.597 --> 00:31:51.901]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[00:31:52.141 --> 00:31:55.584]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:31:55.744 --> 00:31:57.465]  That's ChildEase exclusively.
[00:31:58.346 --> 00:32:15.982]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[00:32:16.223 --> 00:32:19.726]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[00:32:20.066 --> 00:32:23.728]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:32:24.128 --> 00:32:25.388]  hdfirearms.com.
[00:32:25.668 --> 00:32:33.872]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people, they're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[00:32:34.112 --> 00:32:37.833]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.

[00:32:57.206 --> 00:32:58.927]  HDFirearms.com.
[00:33:04.213 --> 00:33:10.459]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:12.876 --> 00:33:33.769]  Take heart, my friends, when I cover all this hardcore information.
[00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:39.232]  Good people always lie down until things get really bleak, really dark.
[00:33:39.733 --> 00:33:40.433]  It's a pattern.
[00:33:40.993 --> 00:33:41.554]  It's a cycle.
[00:33:43.513 --> 00:33:47.994]  We're now experiencing what our ancestors have gone through of every race, color, and creed over and over again.
[00:33:48.514 --> 00:34:00.618]  The cycles of decadence, the cycles of rebirth, the cycles of renaissance, the cycles of decadence, the cycles of corruption, the cycles of tyranny, the cycles of collapse, and then rebirth.
[00:34:02.418 --> 00:34:05.019]  But sometimes civilizations are never really reborn.
[00:34:05.919 --> 00:34:08.300]  They just stagnate into a long nightmare.
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:09.600]  A dark age.
[00:34:11.795 --> 00:34:13.356]  A long despotism.
[00:34:17.479 --> 00:34:28.167]  But things are different now with nuclear weapons and fission fusion and Hadron Super Colliders, cyclotrons, geoengineering, genetic engineering, nanotech.
[00:34:28.607 --> 00:34:31.869]  The mistakes that elites have made in history before.
[00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:39.495]  Really just their mad power lust to become God will be magnified and manifest
[00:34:41.198 --> 00:34:43.859]  Thousands of times what they ever were previously.
[00:34:45.479 --> 00:34:49.100]  Destructively, militarily, millions of times.
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:35:00.183]  And if elites in every period of human history killed millions, and then tens of millions, and then hundreds of millions in the 20th century,
[00:35:01.687 --> 00:35:07.432]  Can you imagine when the bloodletting starts this time on an exponential scale?
[00:35:07.873 --> 00:35:10.855]  It will be in the billions.
[00:35:10.935 --> 00:35:27.831]  The mathematics of human sociology, mass psychology, and anthropology to applied, multi-level, human activity actuaries show total destruction in many areas of this world.
[00:35:28.942 --> 00:35:34.685]  And the globalists have decided to accelerate this and to control it and to try to ride it.
[00:35:35.806 --> 00:35:43.270]  Their argument is it's like the famous Red Adair bombing with dynamite oil wells that no one could put out.
[00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:46.712]  Using an explosion that's bigger to put out the fire.
[00:35:48.113 --> 00:35:56.738]  That's what they say at the very highest levels of the last echelon before you enter the star chamber itself of
[00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:59.051]  Pure satanic evil.
[00:36:01.873 --> 00:36:04.836]  Because you enter that chamber, you go to that level.
[00:36:06.037 --> 00:36:12.622]  It's all about killing everything on this planet as a monument to death.
[00:36:14.283 --> 00:36:20.348]  The desecration of beauty, the desecration of the future, the desecration of
[00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:39.859]  This long march of humanity struggling, fighting, betraying, honoring the good, the bad, the ugly, everyone who's lived, all their hopes and dreams, dashed, all the good, overturning evil, defeating evil, over and over again, going through hell to do it.
[00:36:40.679 --> 00:36:42.340]  The triumph of good over evil.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:48.463]  Evil can never beat good long term, so now evil seeks to destroy all life.
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:54.682]  On the planet, to destroy it, to have total nihilistic victory.
[00:36:56.722 --> 00:37:05.665]  And they argue that the elite will then blast off and leave the planet, because we weren't meant to save the earth, we were meant to leave the earth.
[00:37:08.166 --> 00:37:15.689]  Yes, we were meant to leave the earth, but we were never meant to destroy the cradle that God gave us.
[00:37:19.028 --> 00:37:20.909]  And right now we can't get off the planet.
[00:37:20.929 --> 00:37:37.860]  We're imprisoned here with a bunch of psychopaths who are the type of people that want to grab little kids out of the back of somebody's yard and put them in a basement for two months and torture them and terrify them and rape them and then finally kill them when they go into a catatonic state and have quote been used up.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:46.586]  Well you take those people and you give them 180 IQs and you inbreed them and you give them power and that's what we're facing.
[00:37:50.236 --> 00:38:10.954]  The good news is, every top scientist of any repute, of any renown, is in the news saying, we're going into total tyranny, anti-human nihilism, they're raising an AI system, genetic engineering out of control, nanotech, we're not gonna make it!
[00:38:10.974 --> 00:38:15.918]  In fact, Rob, we did a piece on it a few weeks ago, I never aired it, we had to cue it up and play it.
[00:38:18.635 --> 00:38:20.516]  It's titled, Stephen Hawking interviews with Alex Jones.
[00:38:20.817 --> 00:38:23.058]  Hawking came out and said, we'll never survive a thousand years.
[00:38:23.359 --> 00:38:25.920]  And I said, Hawking, we won't survive a hundred.
[00:38:26.441 --> 00:38:27.602]  We won't survive fifty.
[00:38:27.822 --> 00:38:30.424]  He came out a week later and said, actually I've revised some things.
[00:38:30.644 --> 00:38:31.645]  We won't survive a hundred.
[00:38:32.807 --> 00:38:36.350]  We're not going to survive 20 if we don't put the brakes on this right now.
[00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:38.271]  These people have got to be stopped.
[00:38:38.511 --> 00:38:54.644]  So yes, I'm not worried about them coming after me because I'm not going to go skeet shooting and fishing and deep sea fishing and play golf and enjoy a fancy car and go out to fancy restaurants knowing my seed, my children, will never make it to the future and their children certainly won't.
[00:38:56.787 --> 00:38:58.269]  All that other stuff is window dressing.
[00:38:58.329 --> 00:39:08.398]  My life is window dressing compared to the continuum of my ancestors and everything they did and all their genetic information and their memories and their love and their passion and their spirit.
[00:39:08.598 --> 00:39:14.624]  They pass on like an electrical current connected to myself, to my father and my mother and their parents back.
[00:39:15.024 --> 00:39:19.070]  I am connected to the very first people on this earth just as you are.
[00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:19.871]  It's epic.
[00:39:19.911 --> 00:39:20.632]  It's over the top.
[00:39:20.872 --> 00:39:21.413]  It's incredible.
[00:39:21.654 --> 00:39:29.725]  Look at the airplanes in the sky and all the life and the computers and the relationships and the humor and the music and the mysteries.
[00:39:30.105 --> 00:39:31.587]  It's so fabulous!
[00:39:33.271 --> 00:40:00.464]  What God's given us, and we're told to sit here and look into the dirt and care what Kim Kardashian is up to, and to care what Hillary Clinton's up to, and to care what LeBron James and Obama and Miley Cyrus and all these people, and again, I'm all into celebrating human potential, celebrating the human structure, all of it, but that we're given these icons so they can piggyback globalist propaganda on to the celebration of those icons.
[00:40:01.181 --> 00:40:08.864]  I'm not against celebrating a woman with beautiful dark hair and sexy eyes and voluptuous curves, but when she's attached to a bunch of poison, I am.
[00:40:09.264 --> 00:40:16.526]  I'm not against celebrating a piece of cheese that's tasty, but I don't want to put my finger on it and it's really a trap and slaps down on my thumb.
[00:40:18.627 --> 00:40:21.068]  And of course, in the scale of things, snaps down on my neck.
[00:40:21.968 --> 00:40:23.309]  Snap your finger, snap your neck!
[00:40:25.063 --> 00:40:27.224]  This isn't a game, people.
[00:40:27.804 --> 00:40:29.005]  This isn't a joke.
[00:40:29.125 --> 00:40:30.185]  It's not a drill.
[00:40:30.486 --> 00:40:34.107]  It's toe-to-toe with scientific psychopaths.
[00:40:34.888 --> 00:40:38.229]  A scientific dictatorship that's almost ready to walk.
[00:40:39.049 --> 00:40:40.370]  It's getting up on its knees.
[00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:41.651]  It's learning to walk.
[00:40:42.091 --> 00:40:42.831]  We're feeding it.
[00:40:42.991 --> 00:40:43.712]  We're funding it.
[00:40:44.052 --> 00:40:44.972]  We're protecting it.
[00:40:45.232 --> 00:40:46.053]  And it's growing.
[00:40:48.754 --> 00:40:50.635]  It's replacing the military with robots.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:52.501]  And drones.
[00:40:53.081 --> 00:40:55.264]  It's replacing the jobs with robots and drones.
[00:40:55.544 --> 00:40:57.266]  It's not like it's some innovation that just happened.
[00:40:57.586 --> 00:41:00.530]  They've decided to end the world as of men.
[00:41:02.346 --> 00:41:08.810]  You want to defeat the globalists, grow a garden, have an outside cook stove, get a few acres somewhere in the country, even if you're poor, you can do it.
[00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:10.871]  Go out there, start spending time.
[00:41:11.152 --> 00:41:12.372]  Don't comply with the system.
[00:41:12.632 --> 00:41:18.096]  Get with other people and don't comply with the system because they've actuated the system to implode your economy.
[00:41:18.416 --> 00:41:24.480]  They've actuated the system to make you dependent so you can be basically bought off and controlled and then phased out.
[00:41:25.661 --> 00:41:26.481]  You want your welfare?
[00:41:26.541 --> 00:41:27.862]  You want your food stamps?
[00:41:27.882 --> 00:41:29.003]  You're going to take inoculations.
[00:41:30.919 --> 00:41:32.860]  And then you're going to be brain damaged, and then you're going to die.
[00:41:34.342 --> 00:41:36.303]  I want to get to all this news, but look at these headlines.
[00:41:37.804 --> 00:41:41.507]  Prepare your homes and neighborhoods for the violence that is going to sweep America.
[00:41:42.007 --> 00:41:47.211]  The thin veneer of civilization that we all take for granted on a daily basis is beginning to disappear.
[00:41:49.033 --> 00:41:51.174]  And it begins with the lawlessness of government.
[00:41:51.594 --> 00:41:54.597]  That's a Michael Krieger article, InfoWars.com.
[00:41:55.996 --> 00:41:57.216]  Another Paul Watson article.
[00:41:57.296 --> 00:42:00.217]  Wealthy installing safe rooms to prepare for civil unrest.
[00:42:00.277 --> 00:42:01.497]  We told you this first.
[00:42:02.537 --> 00:42:03.737]  It's now in the New York Times.
[00:42:04.698 --> 00:42:05.878]  It's been going on for 10 years.
[00:42:05.938 --> 00:42:06.718]  It's accelerated.
[00:42:06.758 --> 00:42:15.319]  But mainly, if they've got the money, they're leaving and going to New Zealand, Australia, the Cook Islands.
[00:42:15.339 --> 00:42:19.080]  If they've really got the big money, they're going to Switzerland.
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:23.781]  All the billionaires have left Israel, all of them, in the last five years.
[00:42:23.821 --> 00:42:24.501]  They've evacuated.
[00:42:27.168 --> 00:42:35.792]  And then your mid-level elite are building bunkers under their houses, and inside their garages have four-wheel trucks loaded up with weapons, food, a whole nine yards.
[00:42:35.912 --> 00:42:43.555]  I mean, and I've got this from the biggest home builders for the elite, insiders, you know, you've heard them here on the air, and now it's in the New York Times.
[00:42:43.655 --> 00:42:44.535]  I mean, they're gearing up.
[00:42:45.056 --> 00:42:51.878]  I told you, I ran into a billionaire, a person who was worth about five billion, four and a half, five billion dollars when I looked him up.
[00:42:52.939 --> 00:42:54.419]  They talked to me about 15, 20 minutes.
[00:42:56.149 --> 00:42:57.570]  I wasn't really sure who they were.
[00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:59.512]  I knew I'd seen them before in magazines.
[00:43:01.133 --> 00:43:05.437]  And they explained, they said, listen, you're going to get really big in the next five years or so.
[00:43:06.798 --> 00:43:09.720]  And they said, just about five years ago.
[00:43:11.402 --> 00:43:15.465]  And they said, everything you're saying is dead on and then there's more.
[00:43:15.545 --> 00:43:16.786]  Just keep saying what you're saying.
[00:43:17.127 --> 00:43:17.807]  I'm getting out.
[00:43:17.987 --> 00:43:19.609]  I'm going to the Cook Islands.
[00:43:21.536 --> 00:43:24.258]  And others are going to New Zealand, and I said, what's gonna happen?
[00:43:24.278 --> 00:43:25.880]  They said, everything you say, you know.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:30.423]  And I can't tell you, but there will be no America as you know it.
[00:43:30.523 --> 00:43:32.065]  It's gonna be Mad Max.
[00:43:33.946 --> 00:43:35.388]  And was grabbing me by the arms.
[00:43:39.871 --> 00:43:42.654]  They're gonna implode the derivatives, folks, and all hell's gonna break loose.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:48.264]  And they've got an old prime that people won't turn on the corrupt government to fix it and write off the debt.
[00:43:48.705 --> 00:43:54.270]  It's going to be kill the cops, burn the cities, kill each other, so the government can sit back and pose as the savior.
[00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:56.292]  I mean, you can see them lining it up.
[00:43:56.332 --> 00:44:03.358]  They've got the communists coming out of dry ice, coming out of carbonite, coming out of the freezers.
[00:44:03.398 --> 00:44:05.060]  They're thawing them out all over the place.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.882]  I mean, it is night of living dead, folks.
[00:44:08.002 --> 00:44:08.463]  It's bad.
[00:44:09.991 --> 00:44:15.873]  They're firing up every psychopath, every mental patient, every wind-up toy screwball nut job there is.
[00:44:16.373 --> 00:44:19.113]  The left, the universities are turning up the heat.
[00:44:19.413 --> 00:44:23.935]  That's why you see every day university professors going, I'll kill you if you're in the tea party.
[00:44:24.275 --> 00:44:29.236]  You filth, and like slugging people and they don't even get in trouble, and banning handing out constitutions.
[00:44:29.796 --> 00:44:33.357]  And they're just up there saying, the rain is coming, white males are dead!
[00:44:33.377 --> 00:44:34.938]  And it's mainly white males leading it.
[00:44:37.981 --> 00:44:40.182]  But this isn't Russia with a bunch of disarmed peasants.
[00:44:42.083 --> 00:44:43.384]  This isn't Ukraine or Poland.
[00:44:45.125 --> 00:44:47.206]  And they fought back, but let me tell you something.
[00:44:47.586 --> 00:44:49.888]  If you think you're gonna roll us, you got another thing coming.
[00:44:52.909 --> 00:44:54.050]  But you're meant to be destroyed.
[00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:55.211]  You're just the ignition.
[00:44:55.551 --> 00:44:57.772]  You're just the detonation cap fools.
[00:44:59.793 --> 00:45:01.374]  But there's no doubt the enemy's moving.
[00:45:01.734 --> 00:45:02.775]  They're getting ready to drop the hammer.
[00:45:02.795 --> 00:45:06.537]  I don't know if it's this year or next year, but they're in full crazy gallop.
[00:45:08.066 --> 00:45:11.188]  Now we backed them off overthrowing Syria right away because the military said no.
[00:45:11.508 --> 00:45:15.150]  We've had some other successes, but this is a very serious time to be alive.
[00:45:16.331 --> 00:45:21.793]  Speaking of a serious time to be alive, this operation needs to be funded, and I'd like to bring you only the very best products that do it.
[00:45:22.234 --> 00:45:28.437]  This is one of the most exciting announcements I've ever made when it comes to funding the InfoWars and a win-win for the audience as well.
[00:45:29.077 --> 00:45:32.679]  Here is my breakdown in a four-minute piece that we'll post to InfoWars.com.
[00:45:34.244 --> 00:45:36.045]  Dealing with head down firearms.
[00:45:36.385 --> 00:45:38.886]  Check out their website, HDfirearms.com.
[00:45:39.667 --> 00:45:42.708]  This is the unicorn of assault rifles.
[00:45:42.748 --> 00:45:43.148]  Here it is.
[00:45:45.229 --> 00:45:48.591]  I want to talk about a perfect storm today.
[00:45:49.827 --> 00:45:54.169]  And the perfect storm I'm going to discuss is a really good perfect storm.
[00:45:54.909 --> 00:46:08.474]  I have prayed, literally, to be able to find a high quality gun sponsor that is affordable and that is extremely well made and effective that I can promote to my audience.
[00:46:09.014 --> 00:46:12.795]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:46:13.276 --> 00:46:14.596]  HDfirearms.com.
[00:46:14.956 --> 00:46:16.417]  Low cost compared to competitors.
[00:46:17.137 --> 00:46:23.242]  Super high quality, super lightweight, super accurate, and the experts salivate over it and love it.
[00:46:23.582 --> 00:46:24.863]  It is a perfect storm.
[00:46:25.864 --> 00:46:28.486]  It is a true diamond that we found.
[00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:34.210]  It's amazing, and so I feel so good about fully endorsing Head Down Firearms.
[00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:36.071]  HDfirearms.com.
[00:46:36.451 --> 00:46:38.133]  Check them out today, and then go look at
[00:46:38.613 --> 00:46:40.955]  The dozens and dozens of third-party reviews.
[00:46:41.335 --> 00:46:46.860]  Go and watch the videos of folks stacking this up against rifles that cost $1,000 more.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:59.291]  Their entire line of 5.56, 3.08, and their accessories are simply amazing, and it's designed by battle-hardened vets that know what they wish they would have had.
[00:46:59.831 --> 00:47:06.477]  Right after InfoWars got two of the head-down rifles in, we went out to my buddy Shane Steiner's ranch and had a fantastic time.
[00:47:07.375 --> 00:47:14.461]  Now what I have to say so far, based off looking at this, this is a much lighter weight M4 AR-15, whatever you want to call it.
[00:47:14.802 --> 00:47:16.223]  This is a great weapon.
[00:47:16.263 --> 00:47:19.966]  I mean, I like how the railing system is for your hands, how you can get in.
[00:47:19.986 --> 00:47:20.907]  It's very comfortable.
[00:47:21.227 --> 00:47:26.873]  If I want to go in here and do some close quarters and come around, this is an amazing, amazing gun.
[00:47:27.213 --> 00:47:29.515]  I wish I had something like this when I was in combat.
[00:47:29.535 --> 00:47:30.356]  I mean, I'm telling you right now,
[00:47:30.956 --> 00:47:39.341]  An M4 like this would save a lot of lives if the military would just pick this up and put it Army-wide, Marine-wide, Navy.
[00:47:39.521 --> 00:47:40.502]  This is a good gun.
[00:47:40.702 --> 00:47:45.144]  This is something that's stable, reliable, lightweight, and very easy to use.
[00:47:45.345 --> 00:47:49.647]  Well, this here is another model of the Provectus line, and it's a little more heavy-duty.
[00:47:49.907 --> 00:47:51.168]  It's really well put together.
[00:47:51.908 --> 00:47:52.589]  Nothing rattles.
[00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:55.791]  It's got this enlarged charging handle.
[00:47:56.771 --> 00:47:57.752]  It's ambidextrous.
[00:47:58.342 --> 00:47:59.243]  I've been playing with the trigger.
[00:47:59.864 --> 00:48:01.587]  It's about a three and a half, four pound.
[00:48:02.709 --> 00:48:04.071]  It's got a real crisp break to it.
[00:48:04.632 --> 00:48:13.486]  And again, like I've, I have some, some custom rifles at home that I've spent large amounts of money trying to get a trigger that has that type feel.
[00:48:31.198 --> 00:48:40.526]  Joe Biggs here at the office had the idea of getting a mannequin, wrapping an ISIS flag around it, and sticking a clown wig on top of it with some Tannerite and blowing it up.
[00:48:40.987 --> 00:48:43.369]  And the results were somewhat spectacular.
[00:49:01.522 --> 00:49:09.865]  In my view, guns are an incredible financial investment as well, but they're also an investment in the future liberty of this country.
[00:49:10.265 --> 00:49:16.048]  I'm proud of the fact that the United States is the most armed country in the world, and I want to make sure we keep it that way.
[00:49:16.328 --> 00:49:18.869]  We're not gelded, castrated slaves.
[00:49:19.089 --> 00:49:20.289]  We don't live in North Korea.
[00:49:20.529 --> 00:49:21.850]  We don't live in communist China.
[00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:23.751]  We don't live in Fidel Castro's Cuba.
[00:49:24.111 --> 00:49:29.393]  We live in the United States of America that has been exceptional, that has been amazing,
[00:49:29.773 --> 00:49:33.894]  And then we've been losing ground to the globalists, and now the tide is starting to turn.
[00:49:34.135 --> 00:49:36.855]  The spirit of 1776 is rising.
[00:49:37.096 --> 00:49:43.038]  And I'm telling you, the spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms.
[00:49:43.538 --> 00:49:45.298]  HDFirearms.com.
[00:49:45.438 --> 00:49:48.239]  Or you can visit HeadDownProducts.com.
[00:49:48.379 --> 00:49:49.980]  That's HeadDownProducts.com.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.941]  That's HDFirearms.com.
[00:49:54.141 --> 00:49:58.763]  Just really, really exciting to have a sponsor like this because, again,
[00:49:59.946 --> 00:50:01.990]  Conservatively, $900 to $1,000 for their baseline, up to $1,600 or so.
[00:50:02.051 --> 00:50:02.752]  Similar firearms cost $2,000 to $3,000, $4,000.
[00:50:10.842 --> 00:50:17.628]  And I just couldn't believe how good they were versus other firearms that cost basically twice as much.
[00:50:18.628 --> 00:50:23.312]  And they are private labelers before for some of the biggest names.
[00:50:23.352 --> 00:50:26.775]  They would make the guns for some of the biggest companies out there.
[00:50:26.855 --> 00:50:29.777]  They just said for years, why don't we just put out our own firearms?
[00:50:30.118 --> 00:50:35.742]  Because quite frankly, some of the folks they were supplying didn't want to do quality-wise what would take it to the next level.
[00:50:36.122 --> 00:50:37.564]  So this really is the best of the best.
[00:50:37.884 --> 00:50:40.106]  You can read third-party reviews all over the place.
[00:50:40.646 --> 00:50:44.931]  Breaking it down, saying the same thing I'm saying, because I'm not a firearms expert at shooting.
[00:50:45.191 --> 00:50:45.832]  One decent shot.
[00:50:46.733 --> 00:50:51.678]  But what I am an expert in is defending the Second Amendment and seeing what the experts say about a firearm.
[00:50:51.979 --> 00:50:54.722]  Check out their whole group, 308-556-you-name-it at hdfirearms.com.
[00:50:57.685 --> 00:51:02.106]  So Mark and I were talking about these looters, you know, in Baltimore and in Ferguson.
[00:51:02.146 --> 00:51:05.607]  Seems like every time there's some kind of an upset, the looters come out.
[00:51:05.647 --> 00:51:08.248]  And I'm thinking to myself, you know, I'm a small business guy.
[00:51:08.328 --> 00:51:09.888]  Mark's a small business guy.
[00:51:10.208 --> 00:51:19.390]  And we go to Guns80.com and we get our AR-15 kits and we get our 30-shot magazines and we're ready for the looters if you get my drift.
[00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:20.010]  Hello.
[00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:22.351]  Don't wait for the powers that be.
[00:51:22.371 --> 00:51:23.531]  Go to Guns80.com.
[00:51:23.571 --> 00:51:24.111]  Guns80.com.
[00:51:24.171 --> 00:51:24.471]  Guns80.com.
[00:51:27.114 --> 00:51:29.696]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.

[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:41.002]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.

[00:51:43.564 --> 00:51:45.305]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[00:51:45.445 --> 00:51:50.788]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[00:51:51.028 --> 00:51:54.650]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and lung delivery system at SilverLungs.com.
[00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:56.371]  That's SilverLungs.com.

[00:53:35.111 --> 00:53:35.391]  Thank you.
[00:54:19.952 --> 00:54:30.921]  I'm going to get back into the news, but just briefly on HDfirearms.com, head down firearms, Marine Corps veterans, Navy SEALs, Army Special Ops, basically the whole company, the owner.
[00:54:31.301 --> 00:54:36.306]  The owner is going to be popping in with us to talk about the Second Amendment in general for about 30 minutes at the start of the next hour.
[00:54:37.776 --> 00:54:39.217]  This is the type of sponsor I look for.
[00:54:40.037 --> 00:54:50.161]  I mean, if there's the best water filtration system out there for the price, Gravity Fed, the G2, ProPure Systems, I go out and I get that sponsor.
[00:54:50.821 --> 00:54:57.244]  I went and researched and went and checked the main gardening sites on who has the best deals on non-GMO, heirloom, open pollinated for the lowest price.
[00:54:57.944 --> 00:55:02.226]  And there's a whole bunch of companies, it turns out, so we get eight of them to have the biggest selection.
[00:55:02.726 --> 00:55:05.747]  If we could find eight great water filter companies, we'd have all eight of them.
[00:55:06.465 --> 00:55:14.187]  That's what I want InfowarsStore.com to be, is a place where I would go to get shortwave radios and emergency radios.
[00:55:14.247 --> 00:55:19.788]  A place I would go to get pro-gun, pro-America, pro-Liberty t-shirts to spread the word and meet like-minded people.
[00:55:20.168 --> 00:55:23.349]  A place I would go to get the highest quality nutraceuticals.
[00:55:24.350 --> 00:55:28.731]  Game changers like X2, nasonidine, and secret 12, methylcobalamin.
[00:55:30.551 --> 00:55:32.972]  Super female and super male vitality.
[00:55:33.272 --> 00:55:33.912]  Prostagard.
[00:55:36.465 --> 00:55:37.826]  It's almost pointless even saying it.
[00:55:37.846 --> 00:55:43.309]  We're about to sell out of child ease, about to sell out of our organic oil of oregano.
[00:55:45.971 --> 00:55:48.032]  A lot of these products are just very, very simple.
[00:55:48.132 --> 00:55:49.553]  They work really, really good.
[00:55:49.613 --> 00:55:50.714]  You've heard the right reviews.
[00:55:50.854 --> 00:55:55.897]  And most importantly, it's funding this operation so we can put reporters out there in the field.
[00:55:57.552 --> 00:56:06.417]  So we can send reporters to Boulderburg, as I'm doing this year, coming up next month, so we can put ourselves on cable and satellite, which is happening in the next few months.
[00:56:06.917 --> 00:56:10.600]  This is all you funding us and supporting our local Aminathem affiliates.
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:12.881]  Support their local sponsors.
[00:56:13.341 --> 00:56:15.482]  Become a local sponsor of the local stations.
[00:56:15.623 --> 00:56:16.343]  It's essential.
[00:56:16.783 --> 00:56:17.804]  Give them a donation.
[00:56:18.224 --> 00:56:20.806]  That's how we're gaining more stations, not just getting the ratings.
[00:56:21.266 --> 00:56:22.847]  They have to have the support as well.
[00:56:23.868 --> 00:56:25.548]  So I'm done ranting on that subject.
[00:56:25.608 --> 00:56:34.291]  It's just that HDfirearms.com, all you got to do is call your local gun dealer, your local Sporting Goods shop and say, Hey, have you seen the Provectus line?
[00:56:34.331 --> 00:56:35.811]  Have you seen the Triton line?
[00:56:35.831 --> 00:56:38.772]  Have you seen this great Patriot owned company?
[00:56:39.952 --> 00:56:45.594]  Have you seen the rave reviews of Head Down products, their accessories, all of it?
[00:56:46.735 --> 00:56:54.000]  And they'll go do a review, they'll go look at the reviews, or they may have already heard of it, and say, yeah, I want to look at their Trident.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:56.642]  I want to look at their Provectus.
[00:56:56.722 --> 00:56:58.283]  I want to look at these different models.
[00:56:59.223 --> 00:57:02.145]  And then you can come in, look at them, not even buy them if you don't want them.
[00:57:02.546 --> 00:57:03.366]  Other people will.
[00:57:03.726 --> 00:57:07.229]  This is how you then support the broadcast, and they can be a major sponsor.
[00:57:07.529 --> 00:57:10.051]  It's helping us create the interest in these companies.
[00:57:11.491 --> 00:57:17.512]  They've already gotten to the point where they've been maxed out on production before, so it's not like it's some company that's just out there scratching around.
[00:57:18.232 --> 00:57:27.274]  They're patriots, they're listeners of the show, and they've heard me complain that most big gun companies that actually produce quality are chicken.
[00:57:28.674 --> 00:57:34.655]  We had to get aggressive with the NRA the last six, seven years and basically get in their face until they started defending the Second Amendment.
[00:57:35.175 --> 00:57:39.876]  And I've had NRA board member Ted Nugent on thanking us for doing that.
[00:57:41.127 --> 00:57:43.148]  And saying gun owners of America is the way to go.
[00:57:43.748 --> 00:57:44.989]  We're all on the same team.
[00:57:45.029 --> 00:57:46.149]  We love the NRA.
[00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:47.810]  But they need to be hardcore.
[00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:50.351]  We're facing radical globalist takeover.
[00:57:51.992 --> 00:57:58.855]  And if gun manufacturers get aggressive, if gun manufacturers sponsor liberty, if gun manufacturers pay back into the community,
[00:58:00.745 --> 00:58:04.567]  Then we're gonna support the First Amendment, and we'll support the Second, and they'll support us.
[00:58:04.987 --> 00:58:06.868]  It's synergy, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:07.168 --> 00:58:12.511]  We've gotta hang together, we'll hang separate, as Benjamin Franklin said, and that's why these vets understand that.
[00:58:12.731 --> 00:58:17.833]  So they're supporting InfoWars.com in a big way, helping us go to the next level in the InfoWars, so we salute them.
[00:58:18.353 --> 00:58:25.697]  Head down, firearms, check out their websites, HDFirearms.com, HDFirearms.com, just the letter HDFirearms.com.
[00:58:26.237 --> 00:58:27.778]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com and link through.
[00:58:28.078 --> 00:58:28.418]  All right.
[00:58:28.898 --> 00:58:34.320]  Tons of news coming up on the NSA, Russia's situation, the economy, and more.
[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:35.380]  Stay with us.
[00:58:37.681 --> 00:58:41.322]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:41.342 --> 00:58:43.343]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:46.966 --> 00:58:47.526]  I want more candy!
[00:58:47.546 --> 00:58:48.367]  I want more video games!
[00:58:48.527 --> 00:58:48.647]  Mine!
[00:58:48.687 --> 00:58:48.827]  Mine!
[00:58:48.887 --> 00:58:49.067]  Mine!
[00:58:50.207 --> 00:58:59.592]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:58:59.952 --> 00:59:02.473]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:59:02.653 --> 00:59:05.995]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:59:06.195 --> 00:59:08.936]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system.
[00:59:09.096 --> 00:59:12.217]  And are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[00:59:12.517 --> 00:59:17.378]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[00:59:17.658 --> 00:59:23.819]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[00:59:24.039 --> 00:59:31.501]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[00:59:31.761 --> 00:59:39.047]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[00:59:39.328 --> 00:59:42.791]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:42.911 --> 00:59:46.514]  That's ChildEase exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:49.096 --> 00:59:51.699]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.103 --> 01:00:07.284]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:07.944 --> 01:00:08.744]  You want answers?
[01:00:09.524 --> 01:00:10.385]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:11.065 --> 01:00:14.746]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.266 --> 01:00:19.327]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.311 --> 01:00:34.656]  Look at these headlines on Infowars.com as we raise the alarm globally that tyranny is coming in like a flood.
[01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:37.959]  Neo-feudal USA, the death of democracy.
[01:00:38.659 --> 01:00:44.744]  In neo-feudal America, the financial aristocracy and political elite are judged under a different set of laws.
[01:00:44.764 --> 01:00:46.165]  I want to get Gerald Cilente back on.
[01:00:47.467 --> 01:00:50.609]  NSA can identify you by your smartphone handwriting.
[01:00:51.089 --> 01:00:57.395]  Agency has Lockheed Martin technology to monitor finger swipes on phones to learn the biometrics of how you
[01:00:58.581 --> 01:01:04.226]  How you swipe and how you use the phone to track if it's you using it as they surveil you in real time.
[01:01:04.966 --> 01:01:10.871]  PacSun pulls down upside down flag t-shirt because it hurts someone's feelings.
[01:01:11.271 --> 01:01:12.372]  And I like James Woods.
[01:01:12.412 --> 01:01:13.753]  I think he's a pretty good guy overall.
[01:01:14.053 --> 01:01:14.434]  The actor.
[01:01:14.454 --> 01:01:15.314]  I'm also a fan of him.
[01:01:15.334 --> 01:01:16.195]  I think he's a great actor.
[01:01:16.656 --> 01:01:18.317]  But he's the one that started the whole campaign.
[01:01:18.357 --> 01:01:23.261]  And it's funny because I actually bought some t-shirts at PacSun this weekend for myself and my son.
[01:01:24.422 --> 01:01:26.924]  They got, you know, good summertime type t-shirts.
[01:01:29.073 --> 01:01:34.258]  And I actually saw that shirt and didn't think to buy it just because I thought, you know, the public's too ignorant.
[01:01:35.239 --> 01:01:36.441]  They'll think I hate America.
[01:01:37.081 --> 01:01:40.685]  We should be wearing the flag upside down right now.
[01:01:43.127 --> 01:01:44.949]  We should be wearing the flag upside down.
[01:01:45.490 --> 01:01:46.791]  That means you're in distress.
[01:01:47.852 --> 01:01:51.896]  So when folks with binoculars look at your ship, your flag's upside down, it means you need help.
[01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:53.897]  America's in trouble.
[01:01:54.178 --> 01:01:55.619]  It means the country's going down.
[01:01:56.060 --> 01:02:00.465]  If you respect the flag, they love to have it at half-mast constantly, for any reason.
[01:02:02.127 --> 01:02:04.049]  Seems like flags are at half-mast half the time now.
[01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:05.270]  No pun intended.
[01:02:06.111 --> 01:02:07.393]  When I was a kid, it was every once in a while.
[01:02:08.394 --> 01:02:13.480]  They should be flown upside down, so you can then have a conversation and say,
[01:02:15.305 --> 01:02:16.086]  America's in trouble.
[01:02:16.446 --> 01:02:17.907]  That's why I have directed the crew.
[01:02:17.947 --> 01:02:19.668]  We can have shirts made right here in the U.S.
[01:02:20.048 --> 01:02:20.809]  within two weeks.
[01:02:21.590 --> 01:02:23.091]  That's why we're putting the design up today.
[01:02:23.131 --> 01:02:25.072]  I designed it with the crew before the show.
[01:02:26.433 --> 01:02:28.254]  We'll have the final design by the end of the show.
[01:02:28.314 --> 01:02:34.319]  We're going to put out a t-shirt that's similar to the PacSun one that's black with an upside down American flag.
[01:02:34.879 --> 01:02:38.422]  And it's basically going to say, America is in distress.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.763]  Save the Republic and then we're going to have the U.S.
[01:02:42.843 --> 01:02:47.570]  Code under it and on the back explaining when and why you do that.
[01:02:49.696 --> 01:02:52.778]  United States Flag Code 8A.
[01:02:52.958 --> 01:03:02.985]  The flag should never be displayed with the Union down except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.
[01:03:03.386 --> 01:03:04.286]  Our country's going down.
[01:03:04.326 --> 01:03:05.087]  It's being dismantled.
[01:03:05.107 --> 01:03:06.928]  We're going under UN globalist control.
[01:03:07.689 --> 01:03:09.110]  The president acts as a dictator.
[01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:12.332]  Now is the time to fly the flag upside down.
[01:03:12.372 --> 01:03:16.335]  In fact, can we flip that graphic in there and fly it upside down right now behind me?
[01:03:17.762 --> 01:03:18.763]  I mean, this is the time!
[01:03:18.923 --> 01:03:19.623]  Mayday!
[01:03:19.903 --> 01:03:20.404]  Mayday!
[01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:20.804]  Mayday!
[01:03:20.944 --> 01:03:21.504]  Wake up!
[01:03:21.824 --> 01:03:22.805]  Get out of your trance!
[01:03:24.566 --> 01:03:31.771]  We can use the incendiary nature of the flag upside down to educate the public on why we're doing it.
[01:03:31.971 --> 01:03:34.932]  Because what the flag symbolizes is being destroyed.
[01:03:35.153 --> 01:03:37.094]  Our veterans are being put on don't-treat lists.
[01:03:37.694 --> 01:03:39.295]  Our basic freedoms are under attack.
[01:03:39.915 --> 01:03:43.257]  The Congress is handing over all its authority to the President to sign us on to the TPP.
[01:03:44.448 --> 01:03:46.550]  They're coming after all of our basic freedoms.
[01:03:46.810 --> 01:03:48.131]  Now is the time.
[01:03:50.132 --> 01:03:55.916]  And I've had patriots for 20 years calling in saying, I fly my flag upside down and my neighbors didn't like it until I explained it to them.
[01:03:56.517 --> 01:03:59.059]  And when they come over and say, Bob, why are you flying it upside down?
[01:03:59.079 --> 01:03:59.499]  I don't like it.
[01:04:00.219 --> 01:04:01.761]  Say, hey, I forgive you for being ignorant.
[01:04:02.801 --> 01:04:03.502]  Here's the code.
[01:04:03.642 --> 01:04:04.943]  And the country's in dire straits.
[01:04:05.183 --> 01:04:06.044]  You're supposed to fly it.
[01:04:06.084 --> 01:04:07.124]  That's federal law.
[01:04:08.666 --> 01:04:11.828]  If the country is in dire straits, you're to fly the flag upside down.
[01:04:13.234 --> 01:04:14.795]  And I mean, we need to get people's attention.
[01:04:14.815 --> 01:04:16.375]  We need to get people saying, what's that mean?
[01:04:18.156 --> 01:04:20.677]  Now, I'd imagine PacSun did mean it as trendy.
[01:04:21.758 --> 01:04:27.160]  I'm not a big PacSun guy, but I've bought shirts there a few times just because I like summertime shirts.
[01:04:28.801 --> 01:04:29.742]  And they fit me.
[01:04:30.322 --> 01:04:31.582]  But I guess I did look into it.
[01:04:31.602 --> 01:04:32.943]  They kind of were leftward leaning.
[01:04:32.983 --> 01:04:35.764]  And I do think they kind of meant it as down with America.
[01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:38.926]  But just because they're ignorant doesn't mean anything.
[01:04:40.086 --> 01:04:42.969]  The country is in a super crisis right now.
[01:04:43.569 --> 01:04:48.033]  So I think if you put Save America above the flag upside down, they'll say, what's that mean?
[01:04:48.053 --> 01:04:50.815]  You write born to kill on your helmet, then you have a peace sign.
[01:04:51.396 --> 01:04:52.857]  Oh, something to do with the duality of men.
[01:04:52.957 --> 01:04:55.639]  No, it's not the duality of men, it's the proper signal.
[01:05:01.141 --> 01:05:02.182]  The future doesn't need us.
[01:05:03.682 --> 01:05:05.443]  The future doesn't even like us.
[01:05:06.323 --> 01:05:12.586]  With journalists assembled and offering themselves as human pylons, a self-driving Volvo went full-on Christine.
[01:05:12.887 --> 01:05:17.469]  Accelerating from a distance, it plowed into the journalist who trusted it.
[01:05:18.149 --> 01:05:21.631]  Volvo first said they hadn't purchased the pedestrian avoidance option.
[01:05:22.131 --> 01:05:22.991]  That's an option?
[01:05:23.732 --> 01:05:26.373]  Did they go for the cheaper vehicular manslaughter option?
[01:05:28.897 --> 01:05:35.443]  Then Volvo changed their story and said it was the fault of the owner who failed to activate safety mode.
[01:05:35.523 --> 01:05:41.388]  As we look at the people who failed to move, I ask, would you put your life in the hands of a self-driving car?
[01:05:41.989 --> 01:05:43.290]  You will if you ride in one.
[01:05:44.931 --> 01:05:49.095]  Of course, no accident will ever be the fault of the self-driving car.
[01:05:49.996 --> 01:05:50.236]  Right.
[01:05:50.576 --> 01:05:52.638]  See the video at Infowars.com.
[01:05:52.798 --> 01:05:53.599]  I'm David Knight.

[01:06:12.885 --> 01:06:16.187]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[01:06:31.114 --> 01:06:35.077]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[01:06:56.611 --> 01:06:57.832]  Another major health threat.
[01:06:57.872 --> 01:07:02.754]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:07:02.834 --> 01:07:05.475]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:07:05.515 --> 01:07:12.297]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:07:12.558 --> 01:07:15.419]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:07:15.539 --> 01:07:18.500]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:20.501]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:07:20.521 --> 01:07:23.322]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:07:23.442 --> 01:07:28.944]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:07:29.164 --> 01:07:32.645]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:07:32.665 --> 01:07:35.666]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:07:35.686 --> 01:07:42.868]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[01:07:54.352 --> 01:08:01.599]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:05.022]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:05.042 --> 01:08:08.865]  Well, he started coming on the show about five years ago.
[01:08:26.584 --> 01:08:35.697]  Harry Dent, one of the top analysts previously at Bain Capital, and I thought some of his predictions, though interesting, probably wouldn't happen.
[01:08:35.717 --> 01:08:40.184]  He predicted deflation, not inflation.
[01:08:41.574 --> 01:08:45.898]  And he predicted basically when it would happen, and he's been pretty much spot on so far.
[01:08:46.578 --> 01:09:05.673]  So he'll be joining us in the third hour, and we'll open phones up the last 20-30 minutes to ask your questions of Mr. Dent today, and we'll tie it into massive talk of open war with China, mainstream headlines about, we'll be lucky if we don't have war with China or Russia by this summer, and pray it isn't nuclear.
[01:09:05.753 --> 01:09:07.575]  I mean, I covered all that yesterday.
[01:09:09.838 --> 01:09:13.162]  And this is more than just cyber-rattling, it's a very serious time.
[01:09:15.605 --> 01:09:25.957]  Meanwhile, it's being reported that secret meeting in London to end cash, central banks aim to institute governmental approval for purchase of all sales.
[01:09:28.578 --> 01:09:37.181]  And that integrates in with the fact that we had two weeks ago, six banks pay 5.8 billion, five guilty of market rigging.
[01:09:37.521 --> 01:09:48.766]  They're the very same big mega banks, JP Morgan and others, that are pushing to end cash as we know it, or to charge you to even have cash, or to charge you then to even have deposits.
[01:09:51.047 --> 01:09:54.748]  Meanwhile, these very corporations paid millions of dollars.
[01:09:55.168 --> 01:09:56.949]  The London Guardian is reporting today.
[01:09:58.390 --> 01:10:01.932]  To ram through the TPP in the US Senate.
[01:10:01.972 --> 01:10:03.293]  But that's not corruption.
[01:10:03.793 --> 01:10:04.734]  That's not bribery.
[01:10:05.074 --> 01:10:15.901]  It's not bribery to have Hillary Clinton's foundation getting hundreds of millions of dollars in the last decade, much of it that was supposed to go to
[01:10:17.406 --> 01:10:22.889]  Charities and things going to her for private jets and hotels and mansions.
[01:10:22.929 --> 01:10:28.033]  But what's even worse is most of it's foreign donors from third world dictators.
[01:10:30.494 --> 01:10:32.255]  And they mixed it all in with campaign funds.
[01:10:32.375 --> 01:10:33.156]  Totally illegal!
[01:10:34.917 --> 01:10:39.000]  Dinesh D'Souza goes to jail for getting the five of his friends to give to a Senate campaign.
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:41.321]  I think it was legal, but he pled guilty.
[01:10:41.441 --> 01:10:42.642]  He was facing 20 years in jail.
[01:10:43.082 --> 01:10:44.683]  He's still in jail.
[01:10:44.803 --> 01:10:45.844]  Nine months in prison.
[01:10:48.098 --> 01:10:48.998]  No criminal record.
[01:10:49.819 --> 01:10:50.559]  Speechwriter.
[01:10:50.619 --> 01:10:51.860]  You know, worked for Ronald Reagan.
[01:10:55.221 --> 01:10:58.183]  Has the second biggest documentary film in world history.
[01:10:59.463 --> 01:11:00.724]  And he's in jail right now.
[01:11:01.564 --> 01:11:04.705]  But here's the headline out of the State Department's own admissions.
[01:11:06.006 --> 01:11:07.147]  International Business Times.
[01:11:07.527 --> 01:11:11.749]  Clinton Foundation donors got weapons deals from Hillary Clinton's State Department.
[01:11:11.769 --> 01:11:14.510]  We reported on this yesterday, but it's in mainstream news today.
[01:11:17.657 --> 01:11:25.802]  That's right, dictators in third world countries would give her money when she was at the State Department, and then she would go to the State Department and recommend giving them weapons.
[01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:29.184]  Nothing illegal there, move along.
[01:11:30.525 --> 01:11:39.091]  But don't worry, the Justice Department, that brought you Fast and Furious and the persecution of Christians and with the IRS and so much more and the Tea Party,
[01:11:40.745 --> 01:11:48.092]  They are now going after 40 of the main leaders of the international association that deals with soccer.
[01:11:49.233 --> 01:11:53.317]  They've already arrested some of them, claiming really mild stuff.
[01:11:53.337 --> 01:11:55.779]  But oh, but see, oh, it's a big distraction.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.702]  FIFA officials arrested on corruption charges.
[01:12:01.013 --> 01:12:12.259]  So this is the U.S., the criminals that have hijacked it, basically acting like global government right now to show the world how clean they are and how they're fighting corruption when they are the biggest crooks out there, in my view.
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:30.248]  Now, until about 40 after, and then I'm going to shift gears into Fukushima news and some geoengineering news and some other economic news, election news, Rand Paul news, more on the soccer situation.
[01:12:32.244 --> 01:12:34.105]  Now we have Mr. Dent joining us, as I mentioned.
[01:12:36.386 --> 01:12:38.166]  I wanted to get Lee Queen on.
[01:12:39.687 --> 01:12:47.490]  Owner and CEO, founder of Head Down Products, was founded by David Hunsucker and Lee Queen in a small shop in Powder Springs, Georgia.
[01:12:48.450 --> 01:12:51.992]  Their goal was to develop the most reliable and accurate AR-15 in the market.
[01:12:52.652 --> 01:12:59.254]  This vision was created from a passion for firearms design, hunting, and the Second Amendment, HDfirearms.com.
[01:13:00.155 --> 01:13:00.835]  Now their site,
[01:13:03.021 --> 01:13:06.543]  Even though it's got a lot of servers, has been down since I started plugging it.
[01:13:06.603 --> 01:13:07.944]  But it should be back up later.
[01:13:07.964 --> 01:13:09.484]  We'll also try to give you a phone number.
[01:13:10.245 --> 01:13:16.768]  But really what you want to do is ask your local gun dealer, local gun shop, about Head Down Products that already have great reviews.
[01:13:16.988 --> 01:13:23.031]  Just say, hey, go look at the online third-party reviews of these firearms, the Prevectus, the Triton, others.
[01:13:24.372 --> 01:13:25.152]  They got .308, .556, you name it.
[01:13:28.356 --> 01:13:33.459]  And then look at how affordable they are compared to other firearms that are two to three times more for something similar.
[01:13:33.479 --> 01:13:36.280]  You have to go to the very top end to get something like this.
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:39.001]  And this is, again, half or less of that.
[01:13:39.021 --> 01:13:40.762]  That's why it's such a unicorn.
[01:13:40.842 --> 01:13:44.644]  I mean, it's like the joke of a super beautiful woman that's not high-maintenance.
[01:13:45.324 --> 01:13:45.965]  It's amazing.
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:52.785]  And yes, they're a sponsor, but we've had a lot of firearm sponsors come to us, and I've said, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:13:53.206 --> 01:13:55.328]  Then for a couple months, well, it's like, check out this group.
[01:13:55.348 --> 01:13:56.008]  They're Patriots.
[01:13:56.028 --> 01:13:56.609]  They're great guys.
[01:13:56.629 --> 01:13:57.129]  They're in Georgia.
[01:13:57.169 --> 01:13:58.110]  And I'm like, yeah, really?
[01:13:58.130 --> 01:14:02.835]  And then, yeah, they supply a lot of big top manufacturers, but they're not private labeling now for others.
[01:14:03.075 --> 01:14:03.876]  They're putting out their own.
[01:14:05.477 --> 01:14:06.959]  And then taking out the middleman cost.
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:09.241]  And I went and looked at the reviews.
[01:14:09.301 --> 01:14:10.362]  It's been like three, four hours.
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:34.058]  Overall, a month ago, over a week, and just read scores, reviews, just type in head down reviews, you'll get the big third party sites out shooting them thousands of rounds, going, man, the hype is real about these guns, they're lightweight, I shot 2,000 rounds through it, no problems, beat it up, did all the stuff to it, it shoots as good as a gun that costs $2,000, $3,000, and it costs $1,000.
[01:14:37.182 --> 01:14:41.346]  I mean, that's what's so amazing about the head-down products, HDFarms.com.
[01:14:41.826 --> 01:14:46.170]  But then they're Patreon-owned, they're sponsoring the show to promote the Second Amendment.
[01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:52.616]  Most gun manufacturers... There's some good ones out there that I've approached that are a lot more expensive, so I'm glad to have this one.
[01:14:52.636 --> 01:14:53.377]  It's such a better deal.
[01:14:53.437 --> 01:14:54.738]  And they're like, oh, we don't want to be political.
[01:14:54.778 --> 01:14:56.259]  We like your show, but oh, we're not going to be political.
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.641]  That's what Larry Pratt's talked about as the cowardice.
[01:14:58.682 --> 01:15:03.206]  Well, the folks that own this company are also on the board of a hardcore Second Amendment group.
[01:15:04.139 --> 01:15:05.379]  So it's a win-win-win.
[01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:08.881]  You get a high-quality firearm at an extremely low price.
[01:15:09.341 --> 01:15:10.501]  You support the broadcast.
[01:15:10.521 --> 01:15:13.522]  You support folks that are also involved fighting for the Second Amendment.
[01:15:13.782 --> 01:15:15.243]  It's what I call a 360 win.
[01:15:15.543 --> 01:15:17.063]  Not a win-win-win-win-win.
[01:15:17.363 --> 01:15:18.764]  A win-win-win-win-win.
[01:15:18.784 --> 01:15:19.804]  I mean, we're talking so many wins.
[01:15:20.124 --> 01:15:20.885]  Makes my head spin.
[01:15:20.905 --> 01:15:21.085]  360 wins.
[01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:24.831]  And yes, they wanted to do it.
[01:15:25.872 --> 01:15:31.236]  They've got one that's got Infowars.com on it, Molon Labe, with an Alex Jones signature on it.
[01:15:31.536 --> 01:15:39.782]  It's classy, it's small and nice, and I'm sure it'll have collector value to it, especially if something ever happens to me, but it's not much more to end up getting it with that.
[01:15:40.823 --> 01:15:43.425]  In the ad I cut, I didn't even promote that because, quite frankly,
[01:15:43.965 --> 01:15:46.648]  That's not the reason to get it because you can get a version.
[01:15:47.249 --> 01:15:49.672]  It's got, you know, Mo on Lobby looks really cool on it.
[01:15:49.772 --> 01:15:52.775]  Our design with the helmet and then Alex Jones under his side.
[01:15:54.437 --> 01:15:56.540]  Though I am very honored to be on what I see is.
[01:15:57.922 --> 01:15:58.722]  The top of the line.
[01:15:58.743 --> 01:15:59.363]  I mean, it's the top 3%.
[01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:03.701]  of assault rifles out there.
[01:16:03.721 --> 01:16:12.246]  I mean, in fact, I can't wait to walk around on our family ranch and shoot wild hogs with this because, you know, even if you've got a lighter AR-15, it gets exhausting.
[01:16:13.707 --> 01:16:14.867]  The .308's really heavy.
[01:16:14.887 --> 01:16:15.728]  I've got a Reaper.
[01:16:16.528 --> 01:16:19.130]  Their .308 is a lot lighter and I tend to get one.
[01:16:20.511 --> 01:16:22.332]  So, am I knocking Reapers?
[01:16:22.392 --> 01:16:22.672]  It's great.
[01:16:22.692 --> 01:16:23.092]  I got one.
[01:16:23.112 --> 01:16:23.512]  I spent $3,000 on it.
[01:16:25.029 --> 01:16:26.649]  They got something somewhere for $1,500.
[01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:28.010]  So, I mean, there you go.
[01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:30.671]  And it's lighter, so I'm ranting.
[01:16:31.431 --> 01:16:33.612]  Lee, thank you so much for coming on with us today.
[01:16:33.972 --> 01:16:39.733]  I'm really excited, and I want folks to call their local dealers and tell them, get the HD Firearms line in today.
[01:16:40.654 --> 01:16:43.355]  Thank you so much for your support of the Second Amendment and the First Amendment.
[01:16:44.215 --> 01:16:45.975]  Thank you, Alex, for having me on the show today.
[01:16:46.415 --> 01:16:49.797]  It's very proud to have you as our spokesperson.
[01:16:49.857 --> 01:16:50.797]  It's fantastic.
[01:16:51.496 --> 01:16:56.161]  Well tell us about your company because you've been around for a while but not selling direct to the public.
[01:16:56.221 --> 01:16:57.803]  I know Special Ops loves your stuff.
[01:16:58.223 --> 01:17:01.087]  Joe Biggs started salivating after he was shooting it.
[01:17:01.427 --> 01:17:02.388]  He's a combat vet.
[01:17:03.029 --> 01:17:08.194]  Everybody that I know that's a gun nut that knows more about guns than I do just say these are really amazing guns.
[01:17:09.182 --> 01:17:13.289]  You know, Head Down started was kind of mine and David's, you know, vision.
[01:17:13.569 --> 01:17:15.392]  It really was a hobby, to be honest with you.
[01:17:15.532 --> 01:17:22.002]  I got really frustrated with buying firearms and basically having to re-outfit them to do what they should have done to begin with.
[01:17:23.431 --> 01:17:31.274]  So we started out with the idea of, hey, let's just do something for us, maybe some of our friends and fellow shooters, and really started just building it from the ground up.
[01:17:32.795 --> 01:17:42.918]  Started with billet parts versus forged parts, which is the majority of the AR-15 market is forged upper and lower receivers, and the tolerances tend to be a little bit loose on that.
[01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:45.399]  So we decided to go billet, that way we can control it.
[01:17:46.252 --> 01:17:53.825]  Um, started producing more and more rifles for people and then it turned into really more of a
[01:17:55.773 --> 01:18:04.378]  A nice entity, and we were approached by several companies, and we private labeled for years, making tens of thousands of guns for these people.
[01:18:04.458 --> 01:18:06.619]  And we finally got to the point where we're like, you know what?
[01:18:06.739 --> 01:18:07.920]  We're tired of cutting corners.
[01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:10.601]  They're private labeling, it's their name, but you know what?
[01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:12.022]  Let's just do it ourselves.
[01:18:12.522 --> 01:18:15.764]  Let's just really push it out there, and let's make it the best it can possibly be.
[01:18:15.804 --> 01:18:17.165]  And that's really what we've done.
[01:18:18.151 --> 01:18:18.892]  Well, you have.
[01:18:19.552 --> 01:18:24.115]  I mean, when I saw the great reviews, I said, OK, let me shoot it and then I'll probably work with these guys.
[01:18:24.695 --> 01:18:27.137]  And then I started reading more reviews and I went out and shot it.
[01:18:27.217 --> 01:18:29.179]  I got the rifles in my hands.
[01:18:29.239 --> 01:18:32.401]  I mean, they're so lightweight and they shoot so good.
[01:18:32.461 --> 01:18:33.221]  How did you do that?
[01:18:34.582 --> 01:18:42.708]  We took a lot of time on the accessories that we put on the foreign rails and things like that to really examine and pay attention to what
[01:18:43.735 --> 01:18:44.456]  Operators needed.
[01:18:44.496 --> 01:18:49.702]  I mean, some of our best advisors were people that were active combat or still active military.
[01:18:49.762 --> 01:18:59.493]  And everybody would tell you, as you said earlier in the show, when you have to carry a firearm around, the heavier it is, the more miserable it can become.
[01:19:00.330 --> 01:19:05.373]  So we basically wanted to make it to where it was really, really light, but extremely durable.
[01:19:05.433 --> 01:19:22.483]  So we based it really off of the design of the upper lower receiver, integrated trigger guards to give it rigidity to the gun, the forearm rails we made into where they were very functional that could utilize basically anything you could ever want to put on the gun, but be light enough
[01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:25.547]  Where it didn't just make you miserable all day long.
[01:19:25.607 --> 01:19:27.188]  I mean, I'm a big guy.
[01:19:27.208 --> 01:19:30.150]  I shoot a lot, but to be honest with you, man, I don't like carrying a heavy gun either.
[01:19:30.250 --> 01:19:36.054]  So we kind of basically made head down guns are based off what Dave and I look at and go, you know what?
[01:19:36.714 --> 01:19:41.517]  I think, you know, every guy out there or every female out there would be comfortable carrying this gun.
[01:19:41.557 --> 01:19:46.340]  And now we have the backing of people that do this for a living and say, your gun is steadfast.
[01:19:47.141 --> 01:19:48.722]  And that's, what's really important to us.
[01:19:48.782 --> 01:19:52.945]  We put a lot, a lot of emphasis on feedback.
[01:19:53.665 --> 01:19:55.067]  We want you to break our gun.
[01:19:55.247 --> 01:19:55.627]  Break it.
[01:19:56.148 --> 01:19:56.829]  Send it back to us.
[01:19:56.849 --> 01:19:57.689]  It costs you nothing.
[01:19:57.730 --> 01:19:59.591]  We'll fix it for free and send it back to you.
[01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:01.113]  Show us a weak point.
[01:20:01.353 --> 01:20:02.615]  We love that kind of thing.
[01:20:02.675 --> 01:20:03.976]  We've never backed away from it.
[01:20:04.176 --> 01:20:05.197]  Well, take Barrett.
[01:20:06.358 --> 01:20:08.821]  It was basically designed in a garage in Tennessee.
[01:20:09.141 --> 01:20:14.427]  And I love the American success story from a garage to now your big factory that we went and visited.
[01:20:14.447 --> 01:20:15.488]  We'll show some footage of that.
[01:20:15.928 --> 01:20:16.028]  Yeah.
[01:20:31.202 --> 01:20:34.225]  This is the type of rifle that should be available system-wide.
[01:20:34.265 --> 01:20:37.188]  And Joe was talking about being in combat in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[01:20:37.568 --> 01:20:41.472]  He was a staff sergeant, so he could have extra money to get something better.
[01:20:41.872 --> 01:20:45.775]  But even the stuff he had that was better wasn't as good as what you've got and costing more.
[01:20:46.036 --> 01:20:51.060]  But he said what is issued is giant, clunky, basically crap.
[01:20:51.641 --> 01:20:57.026]  And he just said he can't believe that those guns, because he's seen the purchase orders, you can look at them online,
[01:20:57.566 --> 01:21:01.709]  The military's buying them generally for more than what your firearms cost.
[01:21:02.389 --> 01:21:07.192]  Yeah, the government and the firearms industry is really unique.
[01:21:07.212 --> 01:21:13.937]  It seems to be more of a, I won't say political agenda, but it seems it's who you know when it comes down to that.
[01:21:14.277 --> 01:21:15.678]  And that's understandable.
[01:21:15.758 --> 01:21:16.619]  I see how that works.
[01:21:17.338 --> 01:21:22.620]  We've had a lot of Special Operations Group contact us over the past few years.
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:27.422]  There's one particular unit that carries our weapon.
[01:21:27.682 --> 01:21:35.625]  We're not at liberty to say who it is, but we built it to their specifications and they've been extremely happy with it.
[01:21:36.955 --> 01:21:41.498]  Again, you have to keep in mind that that community is so small.
[01:21:43.179 --> 01:21:44.399]  Everybody knows everybody.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:56.566]  So when you give a product to some of these special individuals that work for our government, if it's not 100% steadfast, you'll never ever sell another one to anybody in that group.
[01:21:56.646 --> 01:21:59.468]  So we pride ourselves on making sure that
[01:22:00.288 --> 01:22:03.190]  If it's going to go in the hands of somebody, it's going to be dependable.
[01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:06.793]  I mean, all of my guys here that are armors are combat veterans.
[01:22:07.834 --> 01:22:08.815]  They've been in battle.
[01:22:09.075 --> 01:22:13.919]  They have had to rely on this weapon system to save their life.
[01:22:13.939 --> 01:22:19.003]  And it's very important to me that every gun that leaves head down has their stamp of approval.
[01:22:21.052 --> 01:22:21.953]  Well, it's amazing.
[01:22:22.033 --> 01:22:27.977]  We just threw some scubs on them and then just took them out and we're shooting really accurate after about 10 minutes.
[01:22:27.997 --> 01:22:35.622]  Then we went up to the shooting range and we were shooting at 100, 200 yards, bullseye, and we don't plan to be great marksmen, you know, just pro Second Amendment folks.
[01:22:36.082 --> 01:22:40.485]  All I know is compared to everything else I've shot, it's the best, and I'm almost embarrassed that
[01:22:40.945 --> 01:22:48.270]  I've got rifles that cost me $2,000, $3,000 that aren't as good, but in all fairness, I bought those three, four years ago.
[01:22:48.290 --> 01:22:58.536]  I know that there's been an evolution, but from what I've read in the different third-party review sites, the big ones, you guys are right there on the cutting edge, right there in the top few percentage points.
[01:22:59.298 --> 01:23:06.207]  Yeah, I would put our weapon, our rifle, against any rifle manufacturer that builds a similar style AR.
[01:23:06.267 --> 01:23:16.119]  I mean, we have been in many competitions and law enforcement trials to do tests and evaluations, and we've always
[01:23:17.253 --> 01:23:22.098]  The ones we've had to participate in or got the privilege to participate in, we've always come on top.
[01:23:22.138 --> 01:23:34.812]  And the thing of it is, a lot of these smaller departments that really do need this type of weapon with some of the threats that we have facing us nowadays, can't afford some of these other companies that charge, you know, two and three thousand dollars.
[01:23:36.133 --> 01:23:47.684]  One of our local community police departments, I mean, they were thankful that they could buy a gun that they could rely on, that would work, that didn't literally break the bank, and they couldn't facilitate anything else for officer safety.
[01:23:47.784 --> 01:23:48.084]  That's right.
[01:23:48.104 --> 01:23:59.996]  You could arm two police officers with, say, your Triton, instead of arming one with a leading competitor, who we're not attacking, but let's face it, a lot of these guys would just buy the guns from you and then double the price.
[01:24:00.964 --> 01:24:01.284]  Correct.
[01:24:01.924 --> 01:24:04.046]  You know, Alex, there's a lot of good companies out there.
[01:24:04.346 --> 01:24:07.087]  Alex, I would never ever say anything bad about another company.
[01:24:08.648 --> 01:24:10.089]  Sure, I'm not writing them down.
[01:24:10.109 --> 01:24:13.470]  I mean, if your gun was $2,000, I think it would be worth it, and I'd be promoting it.
[01:24:13.710 --> 01:24:18.553]  But the thing is, it's such a game changer that it works so good, it's so high quality, and it's so much less.
[01:24:19.033 --> 01:24:22.535]  I mean, there's nothing wrong, I guess, with being greedy, but I guess you guys just aren't being greedy.
[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:26.982]  No, head down's not based off of greed.
[01:24:28.143 --> 01:24:32.846]  We wanted to have people, the working man, be able to own a quality rifle.
[01:24:33.526 --> 01:24:35.867]  I mean, our starting Triton series starts at $849.
[01:24:36.488 --> 01:24:43.312]  You can't buy anything out there comparable to that that's a billet gun versus a forged gun.
[01:24:43.332 --> 01:24:47.914]  Shane said he had a trigger done like yours on a $2,000 rifle and it cost him $500.
[01:24:48.114 --> 01:24:50.816]  Yeah, you can buy our trigger for $179.
[01:24:53.058 --> 01:24:55.919]  And it's comparable to everything out there's three and four hundred dollars.
[01:24:56.299 --> 01:24:57.399]  We don't want.
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:24:59.240]  We don't want.
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:01.820]  I want people to embrace the Second Amendment.
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:14.144]  I want them to be able to utilize and get something that's going to be quality that they can use and be proud to have when you price some of these companies prices so high.
[01:25:15.407 --> 01:25:21.512]  People can't afford to get things like that and unfortunately they don't get to exercise their constitutional rights as they should be able to.
[01:25:21.592 --> 01:25:22.813]  Well you sound like Henry Ford.
[01:25:23.313 --> 01:25:30.619]  He ended up making 20 times as much more money than his competitors because he did the right thing and priced the cars where his employees could buy them.
[01:25:31.654 --> 01:25:35.918]  Yeah, I'm not real big on home runs.
[01:25:35.998 --> 01:25:43.304]  I'd rather just get hitting singles and doubles, make people happy, keep them satisfied, be there for them when they need me.
[01:25:43.644 --> 01:25:45.706]  I mean, head down is very approachable.
[01:25:45.866 --> 01:25:49.409]  I mean, if you have a problem, you don't call your dealer, you call head down.
[01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:54.634]  You talk to one of our managers or you talk to one of our armors and say, this is the problem I have, what do I do?
[01:25:55.598 --> 01:25:56.759]  We should ship it back to us.
[01:25:56.819 --> 01:25:58.220]  We generally turn it around in a week.
[01:25:58.701 --> 01:26:00.242]  We want to be there for our consumer.
[01:26:00.462 --> 01:26:04.686]  We don't want it to be one of these things where, oh yeah, yeah, well, John Smith has a problem with his gun.
[01:26:05.406 --> 01:26:06.127]  We'll send it back to you.
[01:26:06.147 --> 01:26:06.287]  Exactly.
[01:26:06.307 --> 01:26:10.891]  There have been a lot of folks involved in the Second Amendment industry that aren't there for the Second Amendment.
[01:26:10.951 --> 01:26:12.072]  You guys are in it.
[01:26:12.112 --> 01:26:12.573]  You love it.
[01:26:12.893 --> 01:26:13.614]  You're vets.
[01:26:13.694 --> 01:26:14.474]  You're patriots.
[01:26:14.835 --> 01:26:15.875]  It's the American dream.
[01:26:16.536 --> 01:26:17.997]  That's why I'm so excited about this.
[01:26:18.137 --> 01:26:20.719]  I mean, I use the allegory of the unicorn.
[01:26:20.739 --> 01:26:24.862]  I mean, it's really hard to find one of those, but I'm telling you, head down is that.
[01:26:25.242 --> 01:26:39.532]  And so we're so excited about you guys being sponsors and not being cowards because, I mean, so much as you know of the gun industry, and I'm not knocking them, it's just true, we had to basically bully the NRA with Gunners of America and others to stop being so wimpy five years ago.
[01:26:39.952 --> 01:26:42.714]  I know you guys are also involved in Second Amendment groups as well, aren't you?
[01:26:43.317 --> 01:26:48.900]  Yes, ACU, which is Armed Citizens United, I'm on their board as the manufacturer advisor.
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:55.043]  Yeah, unfortunately, Alex, I think that our industry has become kind of like an ostrich.
[01:26:55.063 --> 01:26:57.925]  Let's just stick our head in the sand and it'll go away.
[01:26:58.645 --> 01:27:00.526]  We won't do anything about it.
[01:27:00.586 --> 01:27:04.808]  And the worst thing is, these people have such a platform.
[01:27:05.809 --> 01:27:08.670]  They could get out there and educate people of what to do.
[01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:11.932]  I just thought, I'm just now exercising my Second Amendment rights.
[01:27:13.258 --> 01:27:14.459]  I'm proud to be a gunner.
[01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:15.600]  I'm proud to be an American.
[01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:16.781]  Now what do I do?
[01:27:17.081 --> 01:27:23.346]  Well, no one's out there really saying, okay, well listen, you need to lock this gun up or put the ammo in a different place.
[01:27:23.747 --> 01:27:24.667]  They don't do any of that.
[01:27:24.787 --> 01:27:30.092]  So then it's a big, huge thing when somebody leaves it out and somebody steals it and runs off with it.
[01:27:31.033 --> 01:27:35.438]  Education is the key to our Second Amendment rights, especially in day and age.
[01:27:35.778 --> 01:27:38.942]  I question none of the original amendments, ever.
[01:27:39.362 --> 01:27:44.068]  That is our foundation of our country, that is what our country is based off of, and that's why it's the greatest country in the world.
[01:27:45.169 --> 01:27:47.492]  Nowadays, people want a warning label on everything.
[01:27:47.552 --> 01:27:50.895]  So in our day and age, in my opinion, and this is my opinion,
[01:27:51.755 --> 01:27:52.656]  We all know who those are.
[01:27:52.676 --> 01:27:54.999]  I think education is the key.
[01:27:55.119 --> 01:27:56.220]  I think that's very important.
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:56.661]  No, you're right.
[01:27:56.681 --> 01:28:00.005]  We've got to promote a gun culture or we're going to lose everything.
[01:28:00.025 --> 01:28:11.839]  We're starting to gain ground finally because we started promoting the Americana culture of independence and that starts with the right to free speech and the right to defend yourself and if we don't get on the offense we will lose.
[01:28:12.239 --> 01:28:23.027]  So you've got to learn how to use guns, learn the proper safety, learn how to stow them, get involved in a shooting group, and then bring someone else in who isn't part of the culture, and that's how we're going to win.
[01:28:23.268 --> 01:28:25.709]  Look at what the socialists do with their colleges.
[01:28:25.970 --> 01:28:27.631]  They take normal kids, screw them up.
[01:28:28.011 --> 01:28:30.093]  We've got to take people and deprogram them.
[01:28:30.785 --> 01:28:32.086]  Oh, I agree with you 100%.
[01:28:32.306 --> 01:28:33.888]  There's such a fear.
[01:28:33.928 --> 01:28:38.912]  I had this question asked me the other day that, you know, this is dangerous and that is dangerous.
[01:28:38.932 --> 01:28:40.674]  And I was like, people are dangerous.
[01:28:41.454 --> 01:28:45.358]  And what gets me is about people that are, and I'm glad we have liberals.
[01:28:45.418 --> 01:28:46.699]  I'm glad we have conservatives.
[01:28:47.139 --> 01:28:48.100]  You know, yin and yang.
[01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:49.381]  It takes the world to go around.
[01:28:50.342 --> 01:28:55.466]  But what a lot of people don't realize is your Second Amendment enables you to have your first.
[01:28:56.297 --> 01:28:59.218]  And without those two together, you're out.
[01:28:59.438 --> 01:29:00.338]  You can forget about it.
[01:29:00.538 --> 01:29:01.979]  What we have will be over.
[01:29:03.839 --> 01:29:06.160]  And notice, it is all being destroyed.
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:13.281]  I mean, when they attack one part, they attack the other, and that's why the first and second come first and second, because they team up together.
[01:29:13.301 --> 01:29:18.803]  HDfirearms.com, Lee, is the site back up yet?
[01:29:20.643 --> 01:29:22.484]  Let's see, is the backup running on the website?
[01:29:25.931 --> 01:29:27.252]  It's been going up and down, sir.
[01:29:27.332 --> 01:29:29.113]  Alright, well it's back up right now, folks.
[01:29:29.133 --> 01:29:32.176]  If you couldn't get into it earlier, htfirearms.com.
[01:29:32.216 --> 01:29:37.641]  Call your local dealers and tell them get some of these great firearms in, and believe me, go hold them for yourself.
[01:29:37.661 --> 01:29:40.443]  I know you're gonna get one, and that's gonna help fund the Info War.
[01:29:40.503 --> 01:29:41.484]  It's a win-win-win.
[01:29:41.764 --> 01:29:42.205]  Stay with us.
[01:29:42.265 --> 01:29:43.025]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:46.328 --> 01:29:47.209]  We're on the march.
[01:29:47.729 --> 01:29:49.331]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:52.934]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:57.344 --> 01:30:05.252]  The hearing schedule for today will focus on whether two chimpanzees held by Stony Brook University are property of the university or must be set free.
[01:30:05.613 --> 01:30:11.899]  Champions of the concept of speciesism, like Peter Singer, argue that the chimps should have human rights because they are
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:17.183]  Comparable to three-year-old humans and their capacity for self-awareness, unquote.
[01:30:17.483 --> 01:30:32.994]  The problem is, Singer has argued that Down's Syndrome children should be euthanized because, quote, they will never be able to play the guitar, or develop an appreciation of science fiction, learn a foreign language, or chat with us about the latest Woody Allen movie, unquote.
[01:30:33.274 --> 01:30:36.656]  Singer's speciesism is not about elevating animal treatment.
[01:30:37.116 --> 01:30:42.280]  It's about creating a justification for devaluing human life in all conditions, at all ages.
[01:30:43.462 --> 01:30:50.916]  We will not allow scientific elitists and eugenicists like Peter Singer to deny human liberty and dignity.
[01:30:51.958 --> 01:30:54.342]  This is David Knight reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:30:57.233 --> 01:31:04.156]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[01:33:09.017 --> 01:33:16.264]  Lee Queen is the co-founder of Head Down Firearms, Head Down Products, we should add that, HDfirearms.com.
[01:33:16.704 --> 01:33:19.427]  You notice I rarely have a sponsor up on the show.
[01:33:19.447 --> 01:33:23.511]  I mean, maybe twice a year you'll hear me have a sponsor on the broadcast.
[01:33:24.431 --> 01:33:30.937]  And generally it's concerning news in that industry, like when FEMA got caught trying to corner the market on storable foods last year.
[01:33:31.958 --> 01:33:37.580]  Uh, or I did have a sponsor on, uh, ammo manufacturer, uh, who they were trying to buy all their ammo up from.
[01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:39.040]  So, I mean, I occasionally do that.
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:45.582]  If there's a bill to ban body armor, we'll have a sponsor up about that, but it's not really about the product itself.
[01:33:46.003 --> 01:33:46.983]  This is about the product.
[01:33:47.819 --> 01:33:48.999]  We're not like NPR.
[01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:56.102]  We're not like MSNBC, who on record got their parent companies like $2 billion in stimulus money.
[01:33:56.462 --> 01:34:00.744]  Over $100 million went to MSNBC, including a raise for Rachel Maddow.
[01:34:01.104 --> 01:34:04.545]  Your tax money went to that anti-freedom witch.
[01:34:05.545 --> 01:34:06.326]  We don't do that.
[01:34:07.126 --> 01:34:09.887]  We have some great sponsors, but mainly we sell our own products.
[01:34:11.161 --> 01:34:13.722]  T-shirts, books, videos, cook stoves.
[01:34:14.042 --> 01:34:15.062]  It was just stuff I like.
[01:34:15.143 --> 01:34:22.265]  I mean, I kind of want InfoWarsTore.com to be like a Cabela's and just be high quality stuff, stuff I'm into, stuff I personally use.
[01:34:22.925 --> 01:34:24.206]  I mean, I don't promote something.
[01:34:24.226 --> 01:34:26.327]  You can hear ads on the network that are their own sponsors.
[01:34:26.967 --> 01:34:28.167]  You know, check them out for yourself.
[01:34:28.227 --> 01:34:29.408]  I'm not saying they're good or bad.
[01:34:30.708 --> 01:34:33.689]  You hear me endorsing something, I've really checked it out.
[01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:34.550]  I believe in it.
[01:34:34.730 --> 01:34:35.190]  I use it.
[01:34:36.150 --> 01:34:40.132]  And you can tell I'm very, very, very, very excited
[01:34:41.391 --> 01:34:42.912]  About head down firearms.
[01:34:43.633 --> 01:34:44.694]  Going back to Lee.
[01:34:45.695 --> 01:34:52.601]  Lee, what is the best number for folks if the website goes down because of hundreds of thousands of folks visiting it?
[01:34:53.561 --> 01:35:03.670]  Or if folks don't want to get online, can they call you guys and talk to you and purchase a firearm and have it shipped to their local dealer to take possession of it?
[01:35:04.371 --> 01:35:05.652]  What's the best process for that?
[01:35:06.471 --> 01:35:11.974]  The best number to call is 770-485-7015.
[01:35:12.294 --> 01:35:14.195]  That's our direct line to head down.
[01:35:14.215 --> 01:35:17.937]  Let me get that number out because I had it here and wanted to make sure that was the correct one.
[01:35:17.957 --> 01:35:17.997]  770-485-7015.
[01:35:18.017 --> 01:35:18.057]  770-485-7015.
[01:35:18.097 --> 01:35:18.418]  Thank you.
[01:35:18.458 --> 01:35:18.718]  Go ahead.
[01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:32.291]  Yeah, so they can call directly here and basically tell us what they want, order whatever kind of firearm they want.
[01:35:32.311 --> 01:35:36.412]  So that just flies with their dealer and we can ship it to them.
[01:35:36.432 --> 01:35:39.353]  It has to be, again, within state and federal laws.
[01:35:39.393 --> 01:35:47.595]  You know, some of our unfortunate states in this country doesn't allow these types of firearms, but as long as it's a legal process, it's not a problem.
[01:35:47.615 --> 01:35:49.075]  We can ship it anywhere in the United States.
[01:35:50.051 --> 01:35:57.635]  It's usually just boom, you buy it, it's shipped right to the dealer, unless you're talking about D.C., New York, or someplace like Chicago.
[01:35:58.335 --> 01:35:59.756]  Right.
[01:36:00.276 --> 01:36:04.879]  Some of those unique states, unfortunately, people have had their rights taken away from them, unfortunately.
[01:36:07.172 --> 01:36:08.532]  It's really sad, I hate that for them.
[01:36:08.833 --> 01:36:17.515]  Lee, I've been ranting here, I want to give you 10 minutes or so before you leave us and I get into news, to talk about any other subjects as an American, as a patriot.
[01:36:18.115 --> 01:36:25.077]  Talk about the different line of firearms you have, what you're planning to come out with, it's head down products, some of the other amazing products.
[01:36:25.417 --> 01:36:29.938]  You know, that's the other reviews I've seen that are just as positive, or more so, is your accessories.
[01:36:30.598 --> 01:36:34.779]  Yeah, we started doing holsters.
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.440]  Codex holsters, I actually have one.
[01:36:38.690 --> 01:36:43.732]  And again, we make them for just about every type of pistol you can buy.
[01:36:43.752 --> 01:36:45.433]  They're made out of Kydex.
[01:36:45.693 --> 01:36:49.114]  They have the same as that warranty as our rifles.
[01:36:50.035 --> 01:36:54.377]  It's 100% you break it, we'll send it back, we'll replace it or fix it for free.
[01:36:54.417 --> 01:36:55.357]  There's no charge on it.
[01:36:56.077 --> 01:36:59.259]  And again, a lot of Kydex products, again, are out there that are $80, $90, $100.
[01:36:59.359 --> 01:36:59.559]  Ours are $65.
[01:37:03.896 --> 01:37:05.537]  We do Glock slides as well.
[01:37:06.117 --> 01:37:12.682]  This is one of our Glocks that we have, and I think I actually sent one to someone in Texas that, you know, this is something we do.
[01:37:13.122 --> 01:37:20.287]  You can get a complete Glock with this type of machine work done on it for $799.
[01:37:20.967 --> 01:37:24.390]  So, the closest thing comparable to it is between $15,000 and $3,000.
[01:37:25.110 --> 01:37:29.974]  Again, I wanted to put a product out there that people were happy with,
[01:37:31.165 --> 01:37:31.846]  They could afford.
[01:37:31.866 --> 01:37:34.148]  There's so many things out there that people would like.
[01:37:34.208 --> 01:37:42.636]  I mean, I can remember so many times in my life, Alex, that I wanted to buy something, but it was just so unobtainable because the price was so ridiculous.
[01:37:43.757 --> 01:37:45.259]  And I don't want people to compromise.
[01:37:45.279 --> 01:37:48.682]  I want to build something that they're going to like and embrace, and it's a generational thing.
[01:37:48.702 --> 01:37:50.764]  It's going to be passed down to their son or their daughter.
[01:37:53.132 --> 01:37:57.195]  And you're promoting the Second Amendment, and you're on a major gun group board.
[01:37:57.255 --> 01:38:01.899]  I mean, it is really a win-win, and I thank God for the blessing of you guys being a sponsor.
[01:38:01.919 --> 01:38:02.539]  It's so exciting.
[01:38:02.779 --> 01:38:04.901]  And I just can't wait to take my son and daughters out.
[01:38:05.861 --> 01:38:07.663]  In fact, I think I'm going to get them all
[01:38:08.583 --> 01:38:13.884]  I mean, I've got to be honest, I've shot the more expensive ones, the ones that the special ops guys like and they're great.
[01:38:14.325 --> 01:38:17.345]  And Joe Biggs, big combat vet, again was salivating over that one.
[01:38:18.486 --> 01:38:22.867]  The Provictus, which means, I guess, you know, win before the war through vigilance.
[01:38:23.527 --> 01:38:25.868]  But I like the baseline one the best, man.
[01:38:25.908 --> 01:38:27.248]  That is a sexy rifle.
[01:38:28.028 --> 01:38:31.569]  Our Triton series does the best for us.
[01:38:32.930 --> 01:38:39.052]  Alex, the gun weighs, you were talking about the weight of the gun, I believe the Triton 15 weighs 6.7 pounds.
[01:38:39.432 --> 01:38:40.773]  Oh, man.
[01:38:41.493 --> 01:38:43.434]  When it's hanging on your back, you can't even feel it.
[01:38:44.074 --> 01:38:54.498]  Yeah, it's basically the same exact thing as what a standard base M4 would be, and you get the rail, you can attach the accessories, so forth and so on.
[01:38:55.218 --> 01:38:55.618]  Amazing.
[01:38:55.638 --> 01:38:56.819]  Tell us about some of the other rifles.
[01:38:58.034 --> 01:38:59.015]  Well, I happen to have one.
[01:38:59.035 --> 01:38:59.915]  You were talking about the 308.
[01:39:00.795 --> 01:39:02.396]  This is the 308 that we're doing now.
[01:39:02.496 --> 01:39:03.136]  That is sexy.
[01:39:03.837 --> 01:39:10.960]  Yeah, as a matter of fact, it was put under review at one of the big media training facilities in Daytona, Florida.
[01:39:11.994 --> 01:39:13.135]  That's some really good friends of mine.
[01:39:13.175 --> 01:39:14.736]  They took my personal rifle.
[01:39:15.156 --> 01:39:20.719]  I took it down there and he liked it so much, he wanted me to let him borrow it for a very long extended period of time.
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:27.624]  But they were using that weapon in engaging targets out to 942 yards with the confirmation I got last night.
[01:39:27.644 --> 01:39:36.209]  Now that particular gun starts out, all of them, Alex, have stainless steel match grade barrels on them from the entry level all the way up.
[01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:39.751]  The entry level 308 from head down, all billet, is 1650.
[01:39:41.348 --> 01:39:44.689]  So again, something that's attainable for people.
[01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:53.632]  That rifle you just showed, that's over $3,000 with most major competitors that, in my research, aren't even as good.
[01:39:54.552 --> 01:40:06.476]  Yeah, again, it was one of these things where we looked at, so I can build something that is going to perform as well or better than everybody else's and do it for less for, again, consumers.
[01:40:06.496 --> 01:40:08.376]  I mean, I'm not trying to be this great guy that's out here.
[01:40:08.416 --> 01:40:09.637]  No, I'm not a nonprofit.
[01:40:10.523 --> 01:40:18.746]  But I'd rather get it to the masses, and I'd rather get them a product that they're comfortable in, they can be complimentary of, and they're going to embrace instead of...
[01:40:19.284 --> 01:40:20.805]  Yeah, it's just another one of these things.
[01:40:20.865 --> 01:40:23.968]  I want them to own a head down because they're proud to be head down customers.
[01:40:24.188 --> 01:40:24.968]  Well, I gotta be honest.
[01:40:25.028 --> 01:40:31.253]  I bought some expensive guns and you kind of feel screwed and pathetic when you go and get it because it was so expensive.
[01:40:31.313 --> 01:40:35.156]  I mean, maybe, and I'm not somebody that's, you know, has buyer's remorse.
[01:40:35.576 --> 01:40:39.999]  It's just, it does kind of feel weird that it costs so much.
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:46.864]  But to get something you know is basically half the cost and it's just good or better, it's just sickeningly good.
[01:40:48.065 --> 01:40:57.032]  Yeah, it is a little bit unsettling, Alex, when you have somebody that has a $3,000 rifle and you shoot as well as I do with a $1,000 gun.
[01:40:57.653 --> 01:41:00.715]  It kind of takes a little air out of their sails, if you know what I mean.
[01:41:00.755 --> 01:41:03.337]  And again, it's nothing against them spending the extra money.
[01:41:03.357 --> 01:41:06.400]  I'm glad they do, but it's keeping moving this economy.
[01:41:09.016 --> 01:41:12.417]  I'm very, very proud to say what Dave and I have created at Head Down.
[01:41:12.817 --> 01:41:23.820]  It's, you know, we started a training division to help educate people and to help be able to let them exercise their constitutional rights in a smart, safe fashion.
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:27.001]  And I think that's really what's important.
[01:41:27.041 --> 01:41:33.903]  And, you know, again, you've touched on this, Alex, so many times, and I'm so glad that there's somebody out there that actually has the
[01:41:35.208 --> 01:41:39.329]  The strength and the willpower to say, hey, you know, why are y'all cowering down from this?
[01:41:39.629 --> 01:41:42.350]  You need to stand up for your rights before you lose them all together.
[01:41:43.831 --> 01:41:44.451]  Well, that's it.
[01:41:44.551 --> 01:41:46.152]  We have to get aggressive.
[01:41:46.192 --> 01:41:53.234]  The other side is so embarrassingly tyrannical and pathetic, but we just cower to them so they take over.
[01:41:53.834 --> 01:41:58.255]  All that evil needs to triumph is good men do nothing, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[01:41:59.076 --> 01:41:59.676]  Yeah.
[01:42:01.365 --> 01:42:02.306]  It is scary.
[01:42:02.326 --> 01:42:03.606]  I have two children.
[01:42:04.367 --> 01:42:18.254]  My youngest is in a public school, and to hear some of the things that our schools are teaching about, they really do have a very liberal agenda in a lot of aspects.
[01:42:18.474 --> 01:42:19.815]  It's disturbing to me.
[01:42:19.835 --> 01:42:22.156]  You've got to stand up for yourself.
[01:42:22.196 --> 01:42:23.236]  You've got to stand up for your rights.
[01:42:23.296 --> 01:42:24.017]  Our forefathers
[01:42:24.898 --> 01:42:26.279]  We're very, very smart.
[01:42:26.319 --> 01:42:40.488]  I don't know how that group of people got together so many years ago, but the things that they put in place for us are still majorly impacting everything we do in life and have preserved our way of life for over 200 years.
[01:42:40.748 --> 01:42:44.671]  And a lot of people want to try to kick that and break that down and reinterpret.
[01:42:45.411 --> 01:42:50.835]  They made it very simple when they spelled all these things out on purpose, where they couldn't be interpreted.
[01:42:51.741 --> 01:42:54.103]  It was undoubtedly providence if you study history.
[01:42:54.184 --> 01:42:59.389]  Even foreign historians from Russia and France and England marveled at our founders.
[01:42:59.909 --> 01:43:03.173]  I mean, Benjamin Franklin invented like 2,000 things.
[01:43:03.994 --> 01:43:06.056]  I mean, literally like a third of the stuff.
[01:43:06.296 --> 01:43:07.577]  I was reading one day what he invented.
[01:43:07.858 --> 01:43:09.900]  Like a third of the things in our house, he invented.
[01:43:11.641 --> 01:43:13.684]  With the greatest country in the world, the best
[01:43:15.209 --> 01:43:21.892]  You know, I don't want to see that lost by someone that is, you know, pushing their agenda on the majority of people.
[01:43:21.952 --> 01:43:27.334]  And that's really why I have no problem speaking out for the Second Amendment.
[01:43:27.694 --> 01:43:32.656]  And that's when ACU asked me to be on their board, I welcomed it with open arms.
[01:43:33.817 --> 01:43:39.179]  I want my children and my grandchildren, my great-grandchildren, to have the same rights that you and I have.
[01:43:39.833 --> 01:43:42.375]  I want them to have more rights than you and I have.
[01:43:42.695 --> 01:43:47.438]  I feel like we've lost a lot of things, unfortunately, in the last 50 to 75 years.
[01:43:47.458 --> 01:43:48.659]  I want them to get that back.
[01:43:48.739 --> 01:43:51.441]  I want them to live in a country they can be proud of and be free.
[01:43:51.481 --> 01:43:56.385]  And that's something that I think people take their freedom for granted.
[01:43:56.405 --> 01:43:57.746]  Oh, they do.
[01:43:57.786 --> 01:44:00.247]  They don't realize how good we really have it.
[01:44:00.848 --> 01:44:01.849]  And that's really sad to me.
[01:44:02.589 --> 01:44:10.632]  I watched these young communist trust fund kids, their rich parents, snot-nosed, criticizing free market economics and trashing this country.
[01:44:11.252 --> 01:44:13.353]  And then you ask them, have you been to a communist country?
[01:44:13.393 --> 01:44:14.373]  Have you been overseas?
[01:44:14.393 --> 01:44:16.674]  Do you realize you might get one meal a day?
[01:44:16.734 --> 01:44:18.055]  And they just spit in your face.
[01:44:18.275 --> 01:44:21.436]  They just have no idea what this country's given them.
[01:44:21.476 --> 01:44:22.236]  It makes me sick.
[01:44:23.377 --> 01:44:26.378]  Yeah, I watched that video of you in the midst of that.
[01:44:26.438 --> 01:44:27.618]  I wish I could have been there with you.
[01:44:27.658 --> 01:44:29.179]  We probably could have had a good time with that.
[01:44:31.107 --> 01:44:44.463]  I, you know, when I saw that, I was absolutely speechless to have to know that anybody's parents would allow their children to run so wildly free without any part of respect for anybody else's thought process.
[01:44:44.704 --> 01:44:47.767]  If people want to get out there and exercise their First Amendments and talk about
[01:44:48.786 --> 01:44:49.466]  They don't like this.
[01:44:49.527 --> 01:44:50.107]  They don't like that.
[01:44:50.187 --> 01:44:51.088]  And I'm all for that.
[01:44:51.168 --> 01:44:51.708]  Please do.
[01:44:51.948 --> 01:44:55.030]  But you need to be respectful of other people's thought process.
[01:45:19.006 --> 01:45:20.367]  I'm sorry, I don't want to go off on a rant.
[01:45:20.727 --> 01:45:22.628]  No, hey, I'm worthy on that, brother.
[01:45:22.648 --> 01:45:26.891]  But you notice, they wouldn't do that to somebody they didn't feel like they could take advantage of.
[01:45:27.091 --> 01:45:29.092]  And that's sad to me.
[01:45:29.112 --> 01:45:30.753]  I wish I would have been there with Ronnie.
[01:45:30.853 --> 01:45:35.275]  I would have been more than happy to have made sure his sign was good in place.
[01:45:35.295 --> 01:45:38.277]  Well, what does that say about him?
[01:45:38.637 --> 01:45:43.300]  You would never attack the weak, but with these people, that's their instinct, is to attack the weak.
[01:45:44.005 --> 01:45:44.565]  Well, of course.
[01:45:44.585 --> 01:45:48.907]  I mean, you had one guy on there talking about paying for abortions.
[01:45:48.947 --> 01:45:53.289]  I mean, so you're going to get involved in something like that.
[01:45:53.329 --> 01:46:01.092]  And we can go on a completely different subject matter, but I mean, you're talking about somebody that will take advantage of the most helpless thing on the face of the planet.
[01:46:01.152 --> 01:46:03.313]  And that's, that I'm not okay with.
[01:46:03.393 --> 01:46:07.014]  Yeah, they get off on killing babies because it makes them feel powerful.
[01:46:07.054 --> 01:46:07.774]  These people are demons.
[01:46:07.794 --> 01:46:09.115]  I didn't mean to distract off.
[01:46:09.455 --> 01:46:10.255]  One last question.
[01:46:10.275 --> 01:46:11.496]  I know you're going to send one of these down.
[01:46:12.598 --> 01:46:15.419]  Tell us about the Triton Billet Pistol.
[01:46:15.459 --> 01:46:18.800]  That is an awesome, I mean, that's something I would carry in my truck.
[01:46:19.721 --> 01:46:26.283]  Yeah, the Triton Series Pistol, we make it in a 7.5 inch barrel and we make it in a 10.5 inch barrel.
[01:46:26.683 --> 01:46:32.565]  It comes with a SIG brace or at least one type of arm brace for it.
[01:46:34.226 --> 01:46:38.208]  That has been, it's the same thing, it's funny you say you carry it in your truck, that's what I keep in my truck as well.
[01:46:39.548 --> 01:46:40.968]  It's very compact.
[01:46:41.028 --> 01:46:42.509]  It's very easy to utilize.
[01:46:42.529 --> 01:46:46.130]  I'm sure you're going to get flooded with emails as we are.
[01:46:46.730 --> 01:46:56.292]  You do need to utilize that weapon as it is intended purpose with the brace so that it's been pushed and pushed and pushed.
[01:46:56.312 --> 01:46:58.173]  There are laws if you take the brace off.
[01:46:58.988 --> 01:47:02.211]  Well, you can take the brace off, but you can't shoulder the brace.
[01:47:02.431 --> 01:47:02.692]  That's right.
[01:47:02.712 --> 01:47:03.412]  You can't shoulder it.
[01:47:03.913 --> 01:47:04.253]  Correct.
[01:47:04.273 --> 01:47:08.918]  You're only supposed to use it for its intended purpose, is what the ATF is coming out to say.
[01:47:09.138 --> 01:47:12.221]  Well, explain the fine details.
[01:47:12.241 --> 01:47:13.062]  In fact, I have one here.
[01:47:13.082 --> 01:47:14.063]  I didn't know this just came in.
[01:47:14.083 --> 01:47:15.704]  Wow, look at this.
[01:47:17.006 --> 01:47:19.388]  Because Weldon was telling me, do not shoulder the brace.
[01:47:19.428 --> 01:47:20.029]  Explain that to me.
[01:47:20.816 --> 01:47:29.886]  Yeah, so when Sig came out with this, they basically said, we're making this as a pistol and the brace fits around your arm and it's to stabilize.
[01:47:31.267 --> 01:47:34.771]  Then I got flooded with questions of, you know, can we shoulder it?
[01:47:35.212 --> 01:47:38.936]  You know, and the ATF kind of, they really just didn't address it.
[01:47:38.976 --> 01:47:40.598]  They just kind of backed away from it a little bit.
[01:47:41.294 --> 01:47:46.155]  Well, they continued to get inundated with calls and emails and they finally had to come out and say, do not shoulder it.
[01:47:46.236 --> 01:47:47.496]  It's intended as a pistol.
[01:47:47.616 --> 01:47:55.918]  When you shoulder it, they're saying that it turns into a short barrel rifle, which turns it into an NFA weapon that you have to buy a tax stamp for.
[01:47:57.719 --> 01:48:07.426]  I guess that's a different level of firearms, and then you have to go basically jump through the hoops and go through an ATF background check and buy the tax stamp if you wanted to shoulder this.
[01:48:07.907 --> 01:48:09.108]  That's correct.
[01:48:09.148 --> 01:48:13.451]  You would then turn it into a short-barreled rifle, which then you could put any kind of stock on it you wanted.
[01:48:13.491 --> 01:48:14.692]  You could take that brace off.
[01:48:15.453 --> 01:48:18.755]  And of course, that's all just baloney from Dianne Feinstein.
[01:48:20.156 --> 01:48:22.578]  I mean, the problem's not the gun or the rifle.
[01:48:22.598 --> 01:48:23.479]  The problem's the criminals.
[01:48:24.144 --> 01:48:26.186]  Yeah, that's the same thing.
[01:48:26.226 --> 01:48:29.649]  I mean, you know, my truck has not ran over anybody ever.
[01:48:31.201 --> 01:48:34.984]  And if I leave it parked out there, it probably won't do anything but just sit there.
[01:48:35.264 --> 01:48:44.611]  So it's the people that are utilizing these things, that's the real problem with people making bad poor decisions or making poor choices.
[01:48:45.312 --> 01:48:50.876]  So it really boils down to education of the people, and I am a huge proponent of that.
[01:48:51.397 --> 01:48:55.000]  I would like to see everybody in the world be educated and understand
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:49:02.404]  How valuable their Second Amendment rights are and how they need to utilize them and how they need to be safe when they do.
[01:49:03.404 --> 01:49:03.784]  All right.
[01:49:03.845 --> 01:49:06.466]  Well, Lee Queen, thank you so much for the great work.
[01:49:07.086 --> 01:49:09.227]  HD firearms dot com.

[01:49:32.735 --> 01:49:33.536]  It's so exciting.
[01:49:33.616 --> 01:49:35.538]  One last question about the shorter rifle.
[01:49:36.098 --> 01:49:40.923]  With the 7-inch barrel versus the 2-inch barrel, what's the accuracy of this versus one of your longer barrels?
[01:49:42.683 --> 01:49:46.068]  On the 7.5-inch barrel, it's really more of a close-in gun.
[01:49:46.488 --> 01:49:49.873]  The 10.5-inch, you'll still be good out to 200 to 300 yards.
[01:49:50.614 --> 01:49:58.085]  Comparison, you're going to get far better accuracy on a 16-inch to 18-inch barrel than you will anything else.
[01:49:59.266 --> 01:50:01.828]  Just for a matter of how you can control it a little bit better.
[01:50:02.149 --> 01:50:04.070]  It's a little more forgiving in long ranges.
[01:50:04.110 --> 01:50:11.276]  So if you're going to shoot more long range stuff, anything, you know, 25 yards out to 500 yards, I would definitely recommend a 16 inch minimum.
[01:50:11.296 --> 01:50:12.017]  All right.
[01:50:12.037 --> 01:50:13.258]  Well, I can't wait to shoot this one.
[01:50:13.558 --> 01:50:16.340]  Thank you so much for your support and for putting out such a wonderful product.
[01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:18.922]  Truly the American dream, Americana story.
[01:50:19.503 --> 01:50:25.668]  And I'd put this, I mean, this is pretty much, these rivals are kind of like the Dodge Hellcat of guns.
[01:50:25.688 --> 01:50:26.348]  I've got to say it.
[01:50:27.569 --> 01:50:28.450]  I mean, look at a Dodge Hellcat.
[01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:33.253]  You've got to buy a million dollar Ferrari to be able to beat a Dodge Hellcat, and a Dodge Hellcat's like $63,000.
[01:50:33.493 --> 01:50:40.518]  And I think that's the example right there, you know, is you're getting the super high quality for a much more lower price.
[01:50:40.578 --> 01:50:41.939]  Thank you so much, sir, for what you've done.
[01:50:42.499 --> 01:50:43.780]  Thank you, Alex, for having me on today.
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:44.500]  It's a pleasure.

[01:54:04.222 --> 01:54:05.103]  I mentioned that.
[01:54:05.123 --> 01:54:07.605]  I'm going to go ahead and ask Rob Dood now to bring it to me.
[01:54:07.685 --> 01:54:09.086]  I remember seeing it last night up here.
[01:54:09.526 --> 01:54:11.087]  They were going through the hours of footage.
[01:54:11.608 --> 01:54:12.728]  Alex Jones here back live.
[01:54:13.229 --> 01:54:22.316]  We have the communists kicking and punching a handicapped, you know, like 65-year-old guy.
[01:54:22.336 --> 01:54:26.198]  And then there's another person on a cane who they attack.
[01:54:26.639 --> 01:54:27.599]  It's like wolves.
[01:54:27.659 --> 01:54:29.301]  They see injured old people.
[01:54:30.546 --> 01:54:31.626]  And they start attacking him.
[01:54:32.226 --> 01:54:36.647]  I'm just watching the footage how they'll sneak up like rats and then hit and kick somebody for no reason.
[01:54:37.427 --> 01:54:39.608]  And then run over the cops and go, I was assaulted!
[01:54:39.648 --> 01:54:40.348]  I was assaulted!
[01:54:41.208 --> 01:54:41.728]  Vermin!
[01:54:43.268 --> 01:54:44.808]  Dishonorable scum!
[01:54:47.889 --> 01:54:50.289]  In fact, I need to stop thinking about people like that.
[01:54:50.329 --> 01:54:51.190]  It makes me very angry.
[01:54:51.230 --> 01:54:52.250]  I'm gonna be honest with everybody.
[01:54:52.850 --> 01:54:53.910]  I'm just so sick of scum.
[01:54:54.830 --> 01:54:57.010]  And I'll tell you, these people rule over us now.
[01:54:57.151 --> 01:54:58.151]  I'm tired of it!
[01:54:58.811 --> 01:54:59.691]  I'm sick of it!
[01:55:01.513 --> 01:55:03.154]  I didn't mean to start going off into a rant.
[01:55:03.174 --> 01:55:13.058]  We were talking about that footage during the break, and I want to get Du, if he can, get the other clips of them attacking us, and then link it up with the other footage, and then them, you know, saying they want to kill their kids and all that.
[01:55:14.219 --> 01:55:15.299]  Oh yeah, I kill babies.
[01:55:15.379 --> 01:55:16.099]  I pay for it.
[01:55:16.139 --> 01:55:16.700]  I love it.
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:17.940]  I love Satan.
[01:55:19.481 --> 01:55:20.041]  Really sick.
[01:55:21.022 --> 01:55:21.882]  Really sick people.
[01:55:26.404 --> 01:55:28.005]  Alright, let me get into the news.
[01:55:30.185 --> 01:55:32.695]  Let me just get in some good news first, before I start hyperventilating.
[01:55:34.764 --> 01:55:37.867]  Free-range Maryland family cleared of child neglect.
[01:55:38.187 --> 01:55:40.049]  Remember we first talked about that story.
[01:55:40.449 --> 01:55:42.751]  The 10 kids, no criminal record, no problems.
[01:55:43.191 --> 01:55:49.397]  Facebook folks thought it was weird that they lived on a farm by themselves and so they came and took all their kids because they were unvaccinated.
[01:55:49.417 --> 01:55:54.481]  Now the Washington Post reports that they have been cleared of any wrongdoing and the children have been released.
[01:55:54.942 --> 01:56:00.767]  I can take one look at the hundreds of photos on their Facebook that those kids were living in an idyllic situation.
[01:56:02.210 --> 01:56:04.871]  Those kids look so much better than the average kids I see.
[01:56:12.053 --> 01:56:13.713]  New York Times trumpets U.S.
[01:56:13.753 --> 01:56:16.314]  restraint against ISIS, ignores hundreds of civilians' deaths.
[01:56:19.154 --> 01:56:25.616]  And you see the media saying, don't attack ISIS, that's because it's a real enemy, funded by Saudi Arabia taking over.
[01:56:25.996 --> 01:56:27.116]  That's why they're not being attacked.
[01:56:27.156 --> 01:56:29.217]  I mean, as if our military couldn't take out
[01:56:30.768 --> 01:56:37.195]  A hundred, you know, cars, a hundred Toyotas driving down the road, and it's come out that they're being protected.
[01:56:38.297 --> 01:56:38.577]  Sick!
[01:56:39.238 --> 01:56:40.019]  Here's another story.
[01:56:40.780 --> 01:56:43.202]  This is out of InfoWars.com with Don Salazar.
[01:56:44.344 --> 01:56:45.725]  Natural food victory.
[01:56:46.265 --> 01:56:53.309]  Pizza, Hut, Taco Bell to eliminate artificial ingredients, major restaurant change address, cancer-linked food additives.
[01:56:53.629 --> 01:56:59.012]  And it goes through all the different additives that they're going to be getting out that are connected to petrochemicals and things.
[01:56:59.372 --> 01:57:01.213]  So that's a big victory on that front.
[01:57:02.965 --> 01:57:05.787]  Despite Border Patrol's best efforts, our border is still wide open.
[01:57:06.388 --> 01:57:09.350]  A Bangor Daily News report, very detailed.
[01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:16.574]  Border Patrol agents are further hampered by Obama administration's open border policy, and when they bust people, including drug dealers, they're just told to release them.
[01:57:16.995 --> 01:57:19.216]  You should go read that report, it's on Infowars.com.
[01:57:21.798 --> 01:57:24.780]  This is some good news, but also bad news, out of tech dirt.
[01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:25.721]  Obama
[01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:39.909]  Administration at first, well here it is, obtained emails show FBI's General Counsel briefly concerned about privacy implications of license plate readers all over the country, tracking everywhere you go, but was basically overruled.
[01:57:41.570 --> 01:57:44.051]  So at least there's some halfway sane people in the government.
[01:57:45.893 --> 01:57:47.394]  That's just that little stack of news.
[01:57:47.414 --> 01:57:49.815]  There's no kidding, like 25 other stacks here.
[01:57:51.296 --> 01:57:52.297]  Let's get into this stack.
[01:57:55.086 --> 01:57:59.493]  Senator Rand Paul vows to block NSA vote without ballot to end program.
[01:57:59.573 --> 01:58:02.116]  He wants a vote, up or down vote, to end it.
[01:58:02.677 --> 01:58:05.802]  I would like to have a vote on ending the bulk collection, he said.
[01:58:06.903 --> 01:58:09.828]  So good news to him, using the power of a senator to filibuster.
[01:58:11.863 --> 01:58:13.845]  Continuing here with the news coming up.
[01:58:14.205 --> 01:58:17.608]  Leaked Fukushima containers could lead to hydrogen explosions.
[01:58:17.648 --> 01:58:20.470]  That's the Japanese government RT reports.
[01:58:21.531 --> 01:58:29.237]  Kim Trail Wake Up, Kylie Jenner and her 10 million Twitter followers get news about secret geoengineering program.
[01:58:29.597 --> 01:58:32.139]  We'll break that down as well and more.
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:34.261]  And the latest on the Clinton scandal.
[01:58:34.341 --> 01:58:34.821]  Stay with us.
[01:58:34.982 --> 01:58:36.202]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:58:38.404 --> 01:58:40.406]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:42.128 --> 01:58:44.309]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:47.009 --> 01:59:03.434]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[01:59:03.674 --> 01:59:07.175]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[01:59:07.535 --> 01:59:11.199]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:59:11.580 --> 01:59:12.821]  Hdfirearms.com.
[01:59:13.121 --> 01:59:16.325]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.

[01:59:49.495 --> 01:59:52.129]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:03.052 --> 02:00:07.236]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:07.896 --> 02:00:08.697]  You want answers?
[02:00:09.458 --> 02:00:10.359]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:11.019 --> 02:00:14.703]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:15.223 --> 02:00:19.287]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.161 --> 02:00:36.146]  There are so many video clips I haven't gotten to today ahead of Mr. Dent joining us on The Economy.
[02:00:36.907 --> 02:00:38.588]  I played this one, but I'm tempted to play it again.
[02:00:38.628 --> 02:00:40.030]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:00:40.510 --> 02:00:43.513]  Candidate Obama debates President Obama on government surveillance.
[02:00:44.214 --> 02:00:49.078]  Mayor de Blasio blames gang-on-gang violence for recent crime spike in New York.
[02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:54.163]  You know, the police have been slow rolling
[02:00:55.228 --> 02:01:01.735]  And not talking to community people in Baltimore and in New York and other areas, and crime is just exploding.
[02:01:01.775 --> 02:01:02.817]  And I mean, that's the issue.
[02:01:03.277 --> 02:01:10.946]  Yeah, you've got some of these crime-infested areas that end up having the worst police because it's just a culture of crime.
[02:01:11.867 --> 02:01:15.411]  But then you compare the police to the street thugs, there's just no comparison.
[02:01:16.638 --> 02:01:28.490]  And that's the problem, is that George Soros, again, I keep explaining this because some people don't understand, George Soros wants to make a revolution against local government to smash local government to bring in the feds.
[02:01:28.591 --> 02:01:29.672]  It's an easy equation.
[02:01:30.933 --> 02:01:34.377]  It's a communist playbook from the Nazi collaborator.
[02:01:35.558 --> 02:01:36.519]  Who can make this up?
[02:01:36.579 --> 02:01:37.880]  A Nazi collaborator?
[02:01:38.786 --> 02:01:52.416]  That funds anti-free speech initiatives and overthrowing Ukraine to put fascists in, and who's funding leftist communists to go after the police, so the police only militarize worse and see the public as the enemy, and everything blows up in our face!
[02:01:52.436 --> 02:01:55.979]  I mean, how obvious does this have to get, people?
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:02:03.585]  And then the minority of folks, and I don't mean race-wise, I mean a minority of people go, you just love to worship the police, oh yeah.
[02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:11.746]  That's why I made four films about how out of control the police were because of the feds and the training and the culture change.
[02:02:12.266 --> 02:02:14.488]  I tried to stop this from all happening.
[02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:18.712]  And now I'm trying to stop the next phase.
[02:02:19.112 --> 02:02:20.493]  And you know, I'll probably fail.
[02:02:21.494 --> 02:02:23.176]  And then all you idiots can kill each other.
[02:02:23.656 --> 02:02:24.797]  But I'm not going to be part of it.
[02:02:25.698 --> 02:02:26.819]  I can tell you that right now.
[02:02:30.925 --> 02:02:31.886]  See, I'm getting really angry.
[02:02:32.066 --> 02:02:33.887]  Everybody knows it's not an act when I get like this.
[02:02:33.947 --> 02:02:35.527]  I've been on the air for two hours now.
[02:02:35.868 --> 02:02:36.968]  This stuff starts to get to me.
[02:02:37.548 --> 02:02:39.930]  And then physiologically, I just start getting pissed off.
[02:02:39.970 --> 02:02:42.191]  So, let me just try to settle down for a minute.
[02:02:44.832 --> 02:02:45.592]  Okay, there we go.
[02:02:46.933 --> 02:02:52.516]  I mean, we're sitting on top of a communist revolution in this country, basically, with cities burning.
[02:02:53.601 --> 02:03:01.149]  And the culprits running around are trying to shut my show down and harassing me, people like George Soros and Media Matters, and I'm tired of it!
[02:03:03.291 --> 02:03:07.435]  I mean, if you were actively engaging these people, folks, you'd know how real they were, because they'd be in your face.
[02:03:07.855 --> 02:03:12.300]  And I just cannot believe America accepts the domination of these scum.
[02:03:15.816 --> 02:03:16.536]  Here's the headline.
[02:03:17.077 --> 02:03:20.318]  Leaking Fukushima containers could lead to hydrogen explosions.
[02:03:21.118 --> 02:03:21.999]  That's in Japan.
[02:03:22.399 --> 02:03:25.100]  And I have another report that I meant to send to Nico, but I didn't.
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:36.024]  But it was dealing with China is to build a whole bunch of really dangerous reactors and even their own government, part of the government, saying don't do it.
[02:03:36.724 --> 02:03:37.505]  And here's my issue.
[02:03:37.985 --> 02:03:42.627]  I'm all for nuclear power if you could run it right and that they weren't always leaking and blowing up.
[02:03:44.192 --> 02:03:48.053]  The northern hemisphere of this world, I was saying double the radiation than it was in the 40s, it's triple.
[02:03:51.014 --> 02:03:55.056]  And so the issue is they don't retire the plants after they're supposed to be retired.
[02:03:55.076 --> 02:04:00.297]  These corporations, the leaders, just want profits now and won't run these things properly.
[02:04:01.398 --> 02:04:03.098]  And they don't even build new designs of them.
[02:04:03.918 --> 02:04:05.399]  I'm all for innovation, folks.
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:08.320]  But not the way it's going.
[02:04:09.778 --> 02:04:16.400]  Containers holding contaminated water at the Kribble Fukushima nuclear power plant are at risk of hydrogen explosions, with 10% of them found to be leaking.
[02:04:16.740 --> 02:04:20.241]  As many as 333 containers may be defective, according to TEPCO.
[02:04:20.261 --> 02:04:22.101]  It's just an ongoing meltdown.
[02:04:23.342 --> 02:04:26.362]  And again, can you guys try to forget the exact headline?
[02:04:26.402 --> 02:04:28.383]  I meant to IM it to you, but it didn't come through.
[02:04:28.463 --> 02:04:32.084]  Nico, it was a headline about China building
[02:04:33.226 --> 02:04:35.066]  Questionable reactors, I think, was the headline.
[02:04:35.086 --> 02:04:35.987]  They just green-lighted it.
[02:04:36.507 --> 02:04:37.267]  A whole bunch of them.
[02:04:38.007 --> 02:04:39.347]  Leaking Fukushima containers.
[02:04:39.947 --> 02:04:40.668]  Here's this other one.
[02:04:41.408 --> 02:04:43.988]  Nuclear official warns of explosions at the Fukushima plant.
[02:04:44.428 --> 02:04:46.209]  Gases accumulating in sediment underneath.
[02:04:46.569 --> 02:04:47.429]  Highly-temperated water.
[02:04:47.809 --> 02:04:50.370]  Spark caused by static electricity could ignite hydrogen blasts.
[02:04:50.690 --> 02:04:54.471]  That's what blew up the Max Mox reactor that had plutonium in it.
[02:04:54.691 --> 02:04:56.051]  The big mushroom at Fukushima.
[02:04:57.100 --> 02:05:04.025]  President Obama has said in the past that we must find the proper balance between security of our nation and the privacy of our citizens.
[02:05:04.186 --> 02:05:18.496]  But with numerous whistleblowers coming out, including but not limited to Edward Snowden, Wayne Madsen, and of course William Binney, who tell us that the NSA is doing more than checking Al Qaeda's Gmail accounts, it's about time that somebody held the president's feet to the fire.
[02:05:18.757 --> 02:05:22.940]  Appearing on CBS, Rand Paul noted, here's the thing about the president.
[02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:24.681]  He's disingenuous about this.
[02:05:24.901 --> 02:05:27.462]  The president started this program through executive order.
[02:05:27.622 --> 02:05:29.022]  He could end it anytime.
[02:05:29.282 --> 02:05:35.985]  The senator also noted that the NSA bulk collection was recently ruled illegal by a federal appellate panel.
[02:05:36.405 --> 02:05:37.445]  Why doesn't he stop it?
[02:05:37.785 --> 02:05:39.726]  What's he waiting for, Mr. Paul said.
[02:05:40.066 --> 02:05:42.127]  He says, oh, Congress can stop it.
[02:05:42.367 --> 02:05:43.707]  He started it on his own.
[02:05:44.008 --> 02:05:44.868]  He should stop it.
[02:05:45.148 --> 02:05:48.109]  And I've asked the president repeatedly, stop the program.
[02:05:48.389 --> 02:05:50.590]  But as we all know, that hasn't happened.
[02:05:50.990 --> 02:05:54.531]  You can find more reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[02:05:56.812 --> 02:06:13.238]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the Nightly News, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[02:06:13.458 --> 02:06:16.959]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[02:06:17.319 --> 02:06:20.983]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[02:06:21.364 --> 02:06:22.625]  Hdfirearms.com.
[02:06:22.906 --> 02:06:26.129]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs and Special Ops people.
[02:06:26.229 --> 02:06:31.155]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[02:06:31.355 --> 02:06:32.176]  It's always about security.
[02:06:32.236 --> 02:06:32.616]  We're good.
[02:06:56.770 --> 02:06:59.213]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:06:59.413 --> 02:07:00.414]  Check it out today.
[02:07:00.895 --> 02:07:09.083]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore, cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none, and that's what you'll find at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:07:09.283 --> 02:07:16.351]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[02:07:17.031 --> 02:07:19.372]  Or because they're not 100% organic.
[02:07:19.492 --> 02:07:25.955]  Or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:26.115 --> 02:07:36.999]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine, or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder, I believe
[02:07:37.199 --> 02:07:37.739]  We're good.
[02:08:04.182 --> 02:08:15.092]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[02:08:19.296 --> 02:08:21.918]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:25.032 --> 02:08:31.453]  One thing China has proven is that they have some of the most lax controls on chemical plants, manufacturing, you name it.
[02:08:32.113 --> 02:08:35.014]  Foxconn with suicide nets, forced abortions.
[02:08:35.974 --> 02:08:38.475]  Their rivers routinely catch on fire.
[02:08:39.235 --> 02:08:45.556]  We have completely clean coal power plants in the United States and Canada that put on nothing but water vapor and carbon dioxide.
[02:08:45.876 --> 02:08:47.797]  That's why they pass laws to tax those.
[02:08:48.237 --> 02:08:49.297]  Well, they didn't pass laws.
[02:08:49.957 --> 02:08:54.258]  Obama just said so and taxes them and regulates them to, quote, bankrupt them in his words.
[02:08:54.938 --> 02:09:02.725]  But China builds multiple new plants a week with no controls, no scrubbers, just a plant, water turbines, and the stacks.
[02:09:04.846 --> 02:09:09.650]  Well, London Guardian reports China warned over insane plans for new nuclear power plants.
[02:09:10.331 --> 02:09:11.392]  I mentioned how 300 plus
[02:09:13.376 --> 02:09:13.636]  That's
[02:09:35.137 --> 02:09:45.446]  He, Zhong Yu, I think you pronounce it, a leading Chinese scientist, says the country is not investing enough in safety controls after lifting the post-Sukushima disaster reactor ban.
[02:09:46.167 --> 02:09:55.294]  And it goes on, he ran the country's nuclear weapons programs, you name it, and says that they're going to build scores of these plants, basically on the same type of designs the U.S.
[02:09:55.555 --> 02:09:56.696]  had 40 years ago.
[02:09:57.605 --> 02:10:00.889]  I mean, this is a disaster in the making.
[02:10:01.329 --> 02:10:03.272]  Go read the London Guardian investigative report.
[02:10:03.893 --> 02:10:07.937]  And I only mention that because it shows the above-the-law nature of governments.
[02:10:09.299 --> 02:10:09.960]  Take the Clintons.
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:12.423]  Hundreds of millions of dollars the last decade of...
[02:10:13.743 --> 02:10:19.284]  Charity money they kept for private jets and mansions and foreign dictators giving them money.
[02:10:19.384 --> 02:10:21.145]  Leningradian, again, is reporting on this.
[02:10:21.545 --> 02:10:22.745]  So is Associated Press.
[02:10:23.145 --> 02:10:28.306]  Clinton Foundation donors got weapons deals from Hillary Clinton's State Department.
[02:10:28.566 --> 02:10:32.247]  So you give money to Hillary Clinton and then she says we can give weapons to this country.
[02:10:33.028 --> 02:10:33.928]  Billions of dollars.
[02:10:33.988 --> 02:10:36.188]  I mean, just unprecedented corruption.
[02:10:37.789 --> 02:10:39.089]  Because they're getting away with it.
[02:10:40.745 --> 02:10:44.828]  Now, Harry Dent's been coming on the show, I don't know, five years or so, and he's a best-selling author.
[02:10:44.888 --> 02:10:46.609]  Made a lot of big predictions in the 80s and 90s.
[02:10:46.930 --> 02:10:48.551]  Was one of the top guys at Maine Capital.
[02:10:48.991 --> 02:10:50.072]  He's a routine guest.
[02:10:50.092 --> 02:10:58.458]  Folks, you know who he is, harrydentresearch.com, harrydent.com forward slash alexjones to find some specials and deals on his books that he's kind enough to offer our listeners.
[02:10:59.299 --> 02:11:06.605]  But I wanted to get him on because he's the author of The Demographic Cliff and the editor of the free newsletter Economy and Markets.
[02:11:08.154 --> 02:11:10.575]  And I won't go over his whole bio and where he's worked and what he's done.
[02:11:10.615 --> 02:11:13.217]  Folks know he's a prestigious guy.
[02:11:14.257 --> 02:11:20.541]  But he did accurately predict that we would see, starting last year, global depressionary curves.
[02:11:21.661 --> 02:11:22.602]  And we're now seeing that.
[02:11:23.963 --> 02:11:30.426]  But you've got the queuing unlimited and the race to the bottom, so you've got inflation in luxury goods and some other areas.
[02:11:31.287 --> 02:11:35.089]  So it's almost a perfect storm, at least what I'm seeing in Austin, where stuff does cost more money.
[02:11:36.297 --> 02:11:44.340]  But at the same time, there is a depression in all the businesses I know people have and in talk radio and everything.
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:46.200]  I mean, it's demographic.
[02:11:46.940 --> 02:11:49.341]  I guess the only growth area is going to be in medicine and stuff like that.
[02:11:49.401 --> 02:11:54.363]  So, we've seen a lot of developments now where they admit the economy is growing at 0.2.
[02:11:55.003 --> 02:11:56.484]  That's with Cook numbers.
[02:11:56.944 --> 02:11:59.485]  Ron Paul agreed with me, we're probably shrinking at 2 to 3 percent.
[02:11:59.705 --> 02:12:00.405]  That's a depression.
[02:12:00.965 --> 02:12:25.507]  So I wanted to get Mr. Dent on to give us his global view on the state of the world and where we are planetary, on a planetary scale, but also in a regional scale, and what things like TPP and these unelected boards having more and more control mean, what it means when corruption seems to be at all-time highs and there's no enforcement, but the very Justice Department that won't go after Hillary,
[02:12:26.656 --> 02:12:29.217]  Is going after the Global Soccer League?
[02:12:29.237 --> 02:12:32.358]  I mean, it just seems like a train wreck.
[02:12:32.378 --> 02:12:38.160]  They won't regulate properly nuclear power plants, but they'll harass bigwigs in soccer.
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:41.741]  It seems like the Tea Party from Alice in Wonderland.
[02:12:42.542 --> 02:12:44.702]  Harry Dent, Research.com.
[02:12:44.742 --> 02:12:47.303]  Harry Dent, that's kind of a gestalt I threw out there.
[02:12:47.623 --> 02:12:48.804]  What do you want to tackle first?
[02:12:50.302 --> 02:12:58.046]  Well, you know, Alex, I'll just start with, you know, we've been saying that this year the economy would be weaker than forecast.
[02:12:58.126 --> 02:13:03.069]  Economists just extrapolate past trends in the future and say, oh, we're about to reach escape velocity.
[02:13:03.209 --> 02:13:04.710]  We look at demographics.
[02:13:05.290 --> 02:13:09.152]  Demographics told us in the late 80s that Japan was going to collapse.
[02:13:09.793 --> 02:13:14.275]  It tells us that Germany is going to be the worst hit single country in the next decade.
[02:13:14.315 --> 02:13:15.536]  And nobody expects that.
[02:13:16.332 --> 02:13:28.736]  It says that the affluent in the United States, who are the last part of our economy still spending because they go to school later, their kids go to school later, they peak in spending later, they're getting ready to drop off.
[02:13:29.585 --> 02:13:31.566]  Especially in 2015 forward.
[02:13:31.606 --> 02:13:38.888]  So everybody's looking for this, you know, endless QE to turn into something, when first of all, it's something for nothing.
[02:13:38.928 --> 02:13:44.690]  I don't know how anybody gets that you could create money out of thin air, trillions of dollars, and solve any real problems.
[02:13:44.810 --> 02:13:48.412]  All you do is keep the bubble going that governments started in the 80s and 90s,
[02:13:49.612 --> 02:13:54.796]  And the more the bubble goes, when it finally bursts, it's going to be more painful for everybody.
[02:13:54.876 --> 02:14:00.760]  And China, you were talking about China earlier, I've said over and over again, the U.S.
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:06.224]  doesn't even know what a bubble is compared to what China's done, because China's government has had the most control
[02:14:06.844 --> 02:14:07.505]  We're good.
[02:14:23.465 --> 02:14:26.726]  No skills from rural areas and they just have them build stuff for nobody.
[02:14:27.886 --> 02:14:32.367]  I mean they're building all these empty condos in cities, in ghost cities and stuff.
[02:14:32.907 --> 02:14:42.729]  So China is the biggest bubble and what I'm seeing as an update, Alex, from last time I was on is, you know, the markets are finally kind of getting in a confused state.
[02:14:42.749 --> 02:14:46.350]  They've just been up with all this free money coming in and pumping them up.
[02:14:46.370 --> 02:14:47.990]  There's nowhere else for investors to go.
[02:14:48.647 --> 02:14:51.709]  But starting in December of last year, they've gone sideways.
[02:14:51.789 --> 02:14:56.953]  And the reason is, there is a disconnect between the economy in the U.S.
[02:14:57.834 --> 02:14:59.114]  and what stocks are assuming.
[02:14:59.255 --> 02:15:00.255]  Earnings are slowing.
[02:15:00.636 --> 02:15:02.697]  Retail sales have slowed dramatically.
[02:15:02.937 --> 02:15:04.758]  By the way, I've got to interrupt you and hand it to you.
[02:15:04.798 --> 02:15:05.959]  I wish I had the staff to do this.
[02:15:06.039 --> 02:15:08.661]  I have a great crew, but they're always too busy on breaking news.
[02:15:09.262 --> 02:15:11.303]  You were on a year ago, six months ago.
[02:15:11.403 --> 02:15:14.725]  You literally said by the middle of next year, it'll be clear.
[02:15:15.967 --> 02:15:17.108]  That the growth is dead.
[02:15:17.688 --> 02:15:19.250]  It'll be clear that it's stagnating.
[02:15:19.630 --> 02:15:21.733]  It'll be clear that we're not hitting escape velocity.
[02:15:22.273 --> 02:15:24.375]  We had almost all the other economists saying the opposite.
[02:15:24.396 --> 02:15:27.979]  So I wish your crew would go back to those interviews and get the clips out.
[02:15:28.019 --> 02:15:32.985]  We'd play them next time you came on because you really are making accurate predictions here.
[02:15:34.039 --> 02:15:36.320]  Yeah, and again, we've just got good simple tools.
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:39.000]  We're not doing anything magic or complicated.
[02:15:39.361 --> 02:15:43.962]  We know from cradle to grave when people spend money on everything.
[02:15:44.002 --> 02:15:57.606]  When they enter the workforce, become workers and consumers, when they buy their first house, their largest house, their first car, their luxury car, when they spend money on childcare, I mean camping equipment, even potato chips.
[02:15:58.587 --> 02:15:59.147]  We're good.
[02:16:14.608 --> 02:16:14.948]  We're good.
[02:16:29.764 --> 02:16:45.076]  Because of quantitative easing in response to the slowing of baby boom spinning from 2008 forward, something we predicted decades before, and the same we predicted for the collapse in Japan, the stock market has just gone ballistic way off the fundamentals.
[02:16:45.136 --> 02:16:50.059]  The market's just going up because investors are buying it with free money from the Fed.
[02:16:50.079 --> 02:16:51.921]  There's nowhere else to go with investment.
[02:16:51.941 --> 02:16:53.962]  So there's a huge disconnect.
[02:16:54.002 --> 02:16:57.205]  And so the real economy is stalling in the disconnect.
[02:16:57.785 --> 02:17:02.912]  The folks that are heavily in stocks are still euphoric, but there is a feeling, as I said, of wonderland.
[02:17:02.932 --> 02:17:07.779]  Am I right to say when it's artificial, when it crashes, it'll be that much worse?
[02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:11.304]  Yeah, I mean, you can see from that graph, we've never diverged this much.
[02:17:11.364 --> 02:17:13.908]  So the next crash will be much worse than the last one.
[02:17:13.928 --> 02:17:14.629]  The last one was...
[02:17:15.189 --> 02:17:15.429]  We're good.
[02:17:37.369 --> 02:17:40.231]  But their economy keeps slowing, but guess what?
[02:17:40.251 --> 02:17:44.055]  Their stock market's gone up almost 150% in the last year.
[02:17:44.075 --> 02:17:47.578]  In other words, their economy's clearly slowing and their market's going up.
[02:17:47.638 --> 02:17:55.625]  The reason for this is the Chinese, who've been speculating in real estate more than any investors in the world, they're huge savers.
[02:17:55.885 --> 02:17:56.986]  They love real estate.
[02:17:57.046 --> 02:18:02.551]  Now that real estate's going down, they've all of a sudden switched over to speculating in stocks.
[02:18:02.691 --> 02:18:02.931]  I think so.
[02:18:22.094 --> 02:18:25.635]  And China starts going down like I think it's going to go down in the next year or two.
[02:18:26.075 --> 02:18:28.176]  The wealthy there have so much in that.
[02:18:28.196 --> 02:18:32.017]  There's no amount of stimulus the Chinese government or the U.S.
[02:18:32.037 --> 02:18:34.198]  government can do to counteract that.
[02:18:34.258 --> 02:18:35.338]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:18:35.418 --> 02:18:39.520]  What will a Chinese implosion then, as a guesstimation or dead reckoning, look like?
[02:18:39.900 --> 02:18:41.760]  And how will it affect the rest of the world economy?
[02:18:42.581 --> 02:18:48.442]  Well, first of all, now they've drawn their everyday investors into stocks in addition to real estate.
[02:18:48.482 --> 02:18:50.263]  So they got two major bubbles to burst.
[02:18:50.988 --> 02:18:53.970]  And China was the greatest bubble to burst last time around.
[02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:55.031]  It'll be greater this time.
[02:18:55.091 --> 02:18:57.452]  So their economy implodes.
[02:18:58.353 --> 02:19:01.515]  Their economy has more income inequality even than the U.S.
[02:19:01.535 --> 02:19:01.795]  does.
[02:19:01.896 --> 02:19:04.137]  We lead the Western world in this.
[02:19:04.177 --> 02:19:06.879]  The top 10% of Chinese households
[02:19:07.893 --> 02:19:12.577]  Control 60% of the income and consumer spending.
[02:19:12.597 --> 02:19:14.859]  They own almost all the real estate.
[02:19:15.239 --> 02:19:17.941]  So when real estate implodes, their wealth will implode.
[02:19:18.001 --> 02:19:20.283]  When their wealth implodes, they will stop spending.
[02:19:20.503 --> 02:19:21.964]  They will stop buying real estate.
[02:19:22.024 --> 02:19:22.965]  And not just in China.
[02:19:23.065 --> 02:19:32.633]  I'm just getting ready to do a report for our newsletter coming up, where we look at how the Chinese, the wealthy Chinese, are fleeing in droves
[02:19:33.294 --> 02:19:36.635]  The Chinese government does not allow you to take more... That was my next question.
[02:19:36.715 --> 02:19:37.295]  Stay there.
[02:19:37.455 --> 02:19:39.036]  Amazing that you brought that up next.
[02:19:39.516 --> 02:19:41.837]  I wanted to get to this article at InfoWars.com.
[02:19:42.217 --> 02:19:45.058]  Wealthy installing safe rooms to prepare for civil unrest.
[02:19:45.398 --> 02:19:51.500]  The Guardian reports world elites are racing to secluded rural redoubts.
[02:19:51.780 --> 02:19:53.120]  What is going on?
[02:19:53.220 --> 02:19:54.101]  Stay there, Mr. Dent.
[02:19:54.121 --> 02:19:54.561]  We'll be back.
[02:19:57.170 --> 02:20:02.232]  Yuvia needed financing to grow her restaurant business, but her bank simply didn't understand.
[02:20:02.693 --> 02:20:03.813]  I was frustrated.
[02:20:03.933 --> 02:20:06.474]  Yuvia found On Deck Business Loans.
[02:20:06.854 --> 02:20:07.935]  On Deck did it for me.
[02:20:08.235 --> 02:20:13.417]  I called on Saturday and I had $50,000 in my account on Monday morning.
[02:20:13.578 --> 02:20:14.498]  How about the terms?
[02:20:14.658 --> 02:20:15.638]  Incredibly easy.
[02:20:15.678 --> 02:20:17.259]  It doesn't mess with your cash flow.
[02:20:17.459 --> 02:20:19.000]  On Deck changed everything.
[02:20:19.020 --> 02:20:21.401]  This company, On Deck, is going to be there for me.
[02:20:21.441 --> 02:20:22.281]  Was it a good move?
[02:20:22.502 --> 02:20:24.763]  I'm looking to increase sales probably 30%.
[02:20:25.723 --> 02:20:28.984]  Been in business for at least a year with $100,000 plus in revenue?
[02:20:29.304 --> 02:20:34.806]  On Deck can get you $5,000 to $250,000 in as little as one business day.

[02:20:37.507 --> 02:20:40.348]  On Deck has opened up so many doors for me now.
[02:20:40.488 --> 02:20:42.249]  Truly, truly, the sky's the limit.
[02:20:42.549 --> 02:20:43.589]  I'm excited.

[02:20:48.335 --> 02:20:50.918]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:21:01.031 --> 02:21:01.531]  It's true.
[02:21:01.652 --> 02:21:05.614]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:21:05.814 --> 02:21:07.636]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:21:08.196 --> 02:21:12.699]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:21:12.999 --> 02:21:25.568]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[02:21:47.342 --> 02:21:48.403]  For the love of clean water.
[02:21:56.849 --> 02:22:01.195]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[02:22:01.295 --> 02:22:06.041]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[02:22:06.161 --> 02:22:13.631]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease, and a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[02:22:13.871 --> 02:22:16.412]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[02:22:16.532 --> 02:22:20.954]  I've taken whey protein products for years, and I've never noticed results I have with your product.
[02:22:20.994 --> 02:22:23.955]  I've suffered with bouts of constipation most of my life.
[02:22:24.175 --> 02:22:28.096]  Within a few days of taking One World Whey, I noticed a dramatic change.
[02:22:28.496 --> 02:22:32.218]  Also, in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[02:22:32.418 --> 02:22:35.879]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar, and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[02:22:36.479 --> 02:22:39.961]  For the past week or so, I'm not feeling bad anymore, and the foot pain is gone.
[02:22:40.121 --> 02:22:44.323]  I'm just finishing up a five-pound tuff I ordered and just got off the phone ordering more.
[02:22:44.483 --> 02:22:45.384]  I love your product.

[02:24:06.553 --> 02:24:10.116]  By the way, I'm not selling Harry Dent's books.
[02:24:10.136 --> 02:24:13.719]  I actually should on the online bookstore, InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:24:13.739 --> 02:24:15.020]  That's how we fund our operation.
[02:24:15.821 --> 02:24:22.186]  I certainly read his books and make a lot of decisions based on the research, along with other research I do, and the show's research.
[02:24:22.206 --> 02:24:23.788]  We have a lot of great guests on different angles.
[02:24:25.389 --> 02:24:26.910]  So basically, we're completely transparent.
[02:24:26.930 --> 02:24:28.992]  You just see my whole thinking process here.
[02:24:29.913 --> 02:24:31.834]  He just wants to offer the listeners something amazing.
[02:24:31.854 --> 02:24:33.416]  He's a New York Times bestselling author.
[02:24:34.517 --> 02:24:39.399]  And he's got the new book out, The Demographic Cliff, that is a bestseller.
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:42.361]  He's offering the book free today.
[02:24:42.441 --> 02:24:44.121]  I'll plug this again in the next segment for him.
[02:24:44.902 --> 02:24:46.242]  Free to our listeners.
[02:24:46.843 --> 02:24:54.206]  And it's not like these deals you hear where they go, we'll send you free prostate pills, but shipping's $14.
[02:24:55.907 --> 02:24:56.567]  The shipping is $4.95.
[02:24:57.347 --> 02:24:58.548]  I happen to know what it costs.
[02:24:59.753 --> 02:25:05.422]  Probably $3, $4 if it's media mail to actually ship it, and then $2 for the shipping company.
[02:25:05.502 --> 02:25:06.684]  I think this is at cost.
[02:25:07.085 --> 02:25:08.828]  This is at, or maybe losing money.
[02:25:09.228 --> 02:25:13.715]  This is a true free book deal.
[02:25:15.405 --> 02:25:16.846]  And it's a very powerful book.
[02:25:16.987 --> 02:25:18.728]  Anyone that cares about their future should read it.
[02:25:19.108 --> 02:25:22.532]  It's something you should give City Council people, Congress folks.
[02:25:22.852 --> 02:25:24.353]  People need to understand this.
[02:25:24.894 --> 02:25:25.895]  The elite understand it.
[02:25:25.915 --> 02:25:26.936]  They're making preparations.
[02:25:27.016 --> 02:25:27.596]  We're not.
[02:25:28.057 --> 02:25:30.959]  You can go to harrydentbook.com to find that special.
[02:25:31.239 --> 02:25:32.360]  Harry Dent Book.
[02:25:33.001 --> 02:25:35.744]  H-A-R-R-Y-D-N-T Book.com.
[02:25:35.764 --> 02:25:37.085]  Harry Dent Book.com.
[02:25:37.105 --> 02:25:38.566]  We'll talk about it before he leaves us.
[02:25:38.866 --> 02:25:39.847]  This is a short segment, Harry.
[02:25:39.867 --> 02:25:41.449]  I want to get back to the big question here.
[02:25:43.331 --> 02:25:46.337]  I know a lot of people worth $500 million, $100 million, $1 billion, $4 billion, $10 million.
[02:25:46.357 --> 02:25:46.898]  I live here in Austin.
[02:25:46.918 --> 02:25:47.679]  A lot of them live here.
[02:25:52.319 --> 02:25:55.280]  And I know some in New York and some out in California.
[02:25:55.780 --> 02:25:57.441]  They've all been freaked out for a decade.
[02:25:57.481 --> 02:26:01.643]  But the last five years, they've been really moving into rural areas.
[02:26:01.663 --> 02:26:02.963]  They've been leaving to New Zealand.
[02:26:04.524 --> 02:26:06.224]  They have been getting out of the country.
[02:26:06.604 --> 02:26:10.106]  And when I first talked about this, folks said, no, they're not leaving because of a collapse.
[02:26:10.406 --> 02:26:11.246]  You're being a fear monger.
[02:26:11.606 --> 02:26:11.866]  Really?
[02:26:12.167 --> 02:26:14.187]  I talked to folks that knew James Cameron.
[02:26:14.788 --> 02:26:17.469]  And when he left, I'd already been told he was leaving to New Zealand.
[02:26:17.649 --> 02:26:18.309]  Permanently leaving.
[02:26:18.849 --> 02:26:21.212]  Okay, so you need to understand something.
[02:26:21.692 --> 02:26:25.377]  The elite are, every billionaire has left Israel in the last six years.
[02:26:25.897 --> 02:26:28.360]  They've moved to Switzerland and London and places like that.
[02:26:28.981 --> 02:26:30.843]  So I'm kind of taking up the segment here ranting.
[02:26:31.323 --> 02:26:35.929]  We got an article about elites building safe rooms, bunkers, armored redoubts.
[02:26:37.390 --> 02:26:39.253]  Mr. Dent, what is going on with this?
[02:26:40.657 --> 02:26:45.158]  Well, you know, the smart money always acts first and in no place more than China.
[02:26:45.658 --> 02:26:48.239]  The wealthy in China are leaving in droves.
[02:26:48.279 --> 02:26:53.761]  And what they're doing, since their government says you can only take $50,000 out of here, they said, oh, we're not leaving.
[02:26:53.801 --> 02:26:58.142]  We're just moving to Irvine, California or New York City or Boston or somewhere.
[02:26:58.602 --> 02:27:01.505]  Or London or Melbourne, Australia.
[02:27:01.666 --> 02:27:04.509]  We're just going to get our kids in a good college for a few years.
[02:27:04.769 --> 02:27:05.550]  We'll be back.
[02:27:05.590 --> 02:27:08.493]  And oh, by the way, while we're there, we got to buy a place.
[02:27:08.533 --> 02:27:13.178]  So they buy the most expensive house or condominium they can because they're laundering money.
[02:27:13.219 --> 02:27:19.826]  They're getting their money out of the country so that when things do fall apart, because they know the Chinese bubble can't last.
[02:27:19.906 --> 02:27:27.068]  Listen, you go to a nice restaurant in Austin, or I've been with folks out on a fancy golf course, it's rich Chinese everywhere.
[02:27:27.088 --> 02:27:28.348]  I mean, they're just evacuating.
[02:27:28.508 --> 02:27:29.329]  I'm sorry I'm ranting.
[02:27:30.109 --> 02:27:33.970]  Well, you know, but this happened in the late 80s when Japanese had the big bubble in real estate.
[02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:39.612]  They were making obscene profits, and they were using those profits to go buy real estate the rest of the way around the world.
[02:27:39.652 --> 02:27:47.654]  It's the Chinese that are cropping up most big city markets with these 20 million, 100 million condos, which are just insanely
[02:27:47.654 --> 02:27:48.675]  We're good to go.
[02:28:06.733 --> 02:28:12.094]  When the Chinese stop, the Russians have been doing this too, but their ruble collapsed, so they can't do this anymore.
[02:28:12.374 --> 02:28:17.915]  The Brazilian's economy has been collapsing, along with commodity prices we've been predicting would go down.
[02:28:18.395 --> 02:28:21.556]  Middle East is being hurt by falling oil prices and civil unrest.
[02:28:21.756 --> 02:28:24.557]  So it's really the Chinese are the last people doing this.
[02:28:24.997 --> 02:28:28.158]  And you're right, the smart people in the US, they see this coming.
[02:28:28.438 --> 02:28:30.478]  The smart people in China see this coming.
[02:28:30.778 --> 02:28:32.899]  So we want you to think like the smart money.
[02:28:32.959 --> 02:28:34.839]  We want your audience, people listening,
[02:28:35.564 --> 02:28:43.211]  Don't listen to your everyday friends or listen to, you know, the typical media saying everything's okay and Janet Yellen's going to make everything okay.
[02:28:43.611 --> 02:28:45.553]  There's no way they can stop.
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:48.301]  Well, let me ask you that question.
[02:28:48.321 --> 02:28:51.563]  I'm going to come out and give you the floor to break more of this down in the next long segment.
[02:28:52.543 --> 02:28:55.745]  You will tell people what's going on, and some other people will warn folks.
[02:28:56.105 --> 02:29:00.867]  Why won't the average successful person want to warn the general public?
[02:29:00.908 --> 02:29:06.030]  Is it because they want to have time to position themselves while still making money on the bubble before it implodes?
[02:29:07.311 --> 02:29:07.971]  No, no.
[02:29:08.331 --> 02:29:10.713]  I think even most successful business people don't get it.
[02:29:10.733 --> 02:29:13.634]  Like you said, it's really the really smart money, the top 0.1%.
[02:29:15.745 --> 02:29:17.046]  So you're saying it's bubbleged?
[02:29:45.583 --> 02:29:46.464]  Bubblegum, we gotta go to break.
[02:29:46.484 --> 02:29:50.066]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:50.286 --> 02:29:53.067]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:57.250 --> 02:30:05.154]  The hearing schedule for today will focus on whether two chimpanzees held by Stony Brook University are property of the university or must be set free.
[02:30:05.514 --> 02:30:12.118]  Champions of the concept of speciesism, like Peter Singer, argue that the chimps should have human rights because they are quote
[02:30:12.538 --> 02:30:17.081]  Comparable to three-year-old humans and their capacity for self-awareness, unquote.
[02:30:17.381 --> 02:30:32.892]  The problem is, Singer has argued that Down's Syndrome children should be euthanized because, quote, they will never be able to play the guitar, or develop an appreciation of science fiction, learn a foreign language, or chat with us about the latest Woody Allen movie, unquote.
[02:30:33.172 --> 02:30:36.554]  Singer's speciesism is not about elevating animal treatment.
[02:30:37.014 --> 02:30:42.178]  It's about creating a justification for devaluing human life in all conditions, at all ages.
[02:30:43.359 --> 02:30:50.809]  We will not allow scientific elitists and eugenicists like Peter Singer to deny human liberty and dignity.
[02:30:51.851 --> 02:30:54.194]  This is David Knight reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:30:57.092 --> 02:31:01.295]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[02:31:01.475 --> 02:31:05.437]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[02:31:05.617 --> 02:31:10.400]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.

[02:31:26.790 --> 02:31:27.410]  Alex Jones here.
[02:31:27.811 --> 02:31:36.855]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:31:37.095 --> 02:31:40.557]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[02:31:56.665 --> 02:32:03.609]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[02:33:08.567 --> 02:33:12.449]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:33:12.909 --> 02:33:16.891]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:17.892 --> 02:33:22.294]  And by the way, folks, our economy, they say, is growing at 0.2%.
[02:33:22.354 --> 02:33:23.134]  That is fake.
[02:33:23.995 --> 02:33:26.556]  We'll get Dent, who's an economics expert, to take on that.
[02:33:26.596 --> 02:33:30.038]  But I've had Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on, former head of policy at the Treasury.
[02:33:30.098 --> 02:33:31.198]  I've had Ron Paul on.
[02:33:31.218 --> 02:33:33.560]  I've had Von Mies Institute people on.
[02:33:34.540 --> 02:33:36.021]  John Williams has broken it all down.
[02:33:36.981 --> 02:33:37.762]  Two to three percent.
[02:33:38.780 --> 02:33:39.481]  Actual negative.
[02:33:40.221 --> 02:33:43.563]  And that's with all this unlimited money printing, which they say is coming to an end.
[02:33:43.583 --> 02:33:44.324]  I don't know if that's true.
[02:33:44.704 --> 02:33:51.889]  We'll talk to Dent in a moment and get into why the elites are bunkering down or fleeing the West or any other bubble zone.
[02:33:52.930 --> 02:33:59.774]  But briefly, I saw this this morning and it takes us four days to turn around a new shirt printed up right here in America.
[02:33:59.794 --> 02:34:05.278]  A lot of our shirts are cotton from America, printed in America, sewn in America.
[02:34:07.489 --> 02:34:11.051]  If people want them really inexpensive, they come from Mexico and places like that, then they're printed in America.
[02:34:11.432 --> 02:34:12.332]  This shirt will be.
[02:34:12.672 --> 02:34:14.434]  It'll take me a month to get it made in America.
[02:34:14.454 --> 02:34:16.855]  We're going to have a version that's made in America as well.
[02:34:17.736 --> 02:34:20.358]  But regardless, it gets the word out.
[02:34:20.418 --> 02:34:24.961]  Pac's son pulled upside down flag t-shirt because it hurts someone's feelings.
[02:34:25.501 --> 02:34:27.162]  And this is a leftist organization.
[02:34:27.602 --> 02:34:29.944]  I would imagine they did it to like down with America or something.
[02:34:31.125 --> 02:34:35.588]  And James Woods, the actor with his millions of Twitter followers, started a big boycott of it.
[02:34:35.888 --> 02:34:37.169]  So they pulled the shirt.
[02:34:38.370 --> 02:34:39.872]  Well, I don't even know if that's a good idea.
[02:34:39.912 --> 02:34:41.073]  I mean, let people do what they want.
[02:34:41.093 --> 02:34:45.418]  But I thought, hey, I already had an idea for an upside-down American flag shirt.
[02:34:45.799 --> 02:34:47.801]  Because under federal law, under U.S.
[02:34:47.861 --> 02:34:52.487]  code, when the country's in crisis, when a ship's in crisis,
[02:34:54.326 --> 02:34:56.748]  When you're in distress, you fly the flag upside down.
[02:34:56.828 --> 02:35:03.352]  The flag should be flown upside down when the borders are open and world government's being announced and the president's acting more and more like a dictator.
[02:35:03.372 --> 02:35:05.413]  So we're gonna have a limited edition.
[02:35:05.453 --> 02:35:09.736]  And by limited edition, I'm gonna put it out for... I'll put it out to the end of the year.
[02:35:10.396 --> 02:35:11.137]  The announcement's made.
[02:35:11.877 --> 02:35:12.898]  And then we'll never make it again.
[02:35:13.098 --> 02:35:15.039]  It's a Save America shirt.
[02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:18.281]  And it's simply, if you're a radio listener, I'll describe it.
[02:35:18.301 --> 02:35:20.703]  You can go to InfoWars.com to see it.
[02:35:21.323 --> 02:35:23.625]  And then it also funds our operation to help save America.
[02:35:25.310 --> 02:35:31.655]  It says in big bold letters, Save America, so people can understand what we're saying, so you don't get in a fist fight.
[02:35:32.116 --> 02:35:40.442]  Then under it, the American flag in black and white is upside down, and under that says United States Flag Code, Title IV, Chapter 1.
[02:35:40.843 --> 02:35:50.551]  The flag should never be displayed with the Union down, except as a signal of the dire distress in instances of extreme danger or life or property.
[02:35:52.145 --> 02:35:54.646]  Now is the time to fly the flag upside down.
[02:35:54.706 --> 02:35:57.147]  When folks get mad at you, you say, listen, I love this country.
[02:35:57.247 --> 02:35:57.927]  Are we in distress?
[02:35:57.947 --> 02:35:58.568]  And they go, yes.
[02:35:59.308 --> 02:36:00.208]  That's what you're supposed to do.
[02:36:00.288 --> 02:36:01.689]  We need to get people's attention.
[02:36:02.409 --> 02:36:03.670]  And I'm going to wear this flag.
[02:36:04.090 --> 02:36:06.291]  I'm sure the media will attack me, and I'll say, really?
[02:36:07.531 --> 02:36:09.472]  The country is in an emergency.
[02:36:09.952 --> 02:36:12.153]  What the flag stands for is on fire.
[02:36:12.173 --> 02:36:19.236]  We got communists every week burning American flags, blocking the highway down here, and attacking old people and stuff.
[02:36:19.256 --> 02:36:20.036]  They don't even get in trouble.
[02:36:21.391 --> 02:36:23.432]  The country's in trouble, folks, and I'm tired of it.
[02:36:25.132 --> 02:36:27.753]  So the Save America flag, we're going to sell this through the rest of 2015.
[02:36:28.173 --> 02:36:29.774]  It'll help support the Info War.
[02:36:30.034 --> 02:36:31.474]  And when they're gone, they're gone.
[02:36:31.615 --> 02:36:36.896]  And we will print this with a Made America version and another one made in Mexico or whatever, where we can get them the quickest.
[02:36:36.916 --> 02:36:38.537]  But we've got black t-shirts in stock.
[02:36:38.557 --> 02:36:39.237]  We're ready to print them.
[02:36:39.577 --> 02:36:41.118]  We're going to start printing them in the next two days.
[02:36:41.138 --> 02:36:43.939]  They'll ship them to us from, what is it, Georgia again.
[02:36:44.974 --> 02:36:47.995]  And they'll be here by next week, and we will ship them out to you.
[02:36:48.195 --> 02:36:48.855]  Order today.
[02:36:49.315 --> 02:36:51.655]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:36:52.215 --> 02:36:56.156]  Infowarsstore.com in the regular Patriot Apparel section.
[02:36:57.016 --> 02:36:58.376]  Some of the stuff in there is made in America.
[02:36:58.616 --> 02:37:03.717]  If you go to madein1776.com, that's the all 100% made in America section of the site.
[02:37:03.737 --> 02:37:07.718]  Instead of the shirts costing $50 like made in America, they cost $20 to $25.
[02:37:07.758 --> 02:37:10.378]  They're a lot less.
[02:37:10.418 --> 02:37:12.019]  I mean, a ball cap made in America costs $10, $12.
[02:37:13.652 --> 02:37:14.453]  Made in China, $1.
[02:37:14.493 --> 02:37:15.774]  Made in Mexico, $2.
[02:37:16.154 --> 02:37:17.075]  So we just offer both.
[02:37:17.496 --> 02:37:18.236]  You want to save money?
[02:37:18.396 --> 02:37:19.818]  Get it from Mexico or whatever?
[02:37:19.878 --> 02:37:20.218]  We got it.
[02:37:20.638 --> 02:37:21.719]  You want to get it from here?
[02:37:21.840 --> 02:37:22.260]  We got it.
[02:37:22.820 --> 02:37:28.866]  It does tend to be better quality made in America, but to get this out quick, it's not made in the U.S.
[02:37:28.926 --> 02:37:30.748]  It is printed here in the U.S., but that doesn't matter.
[02:37:30.788 --> 02:37:33.090]  The point is, get the shirt, support the InfoWar.
[02:37:33.490 --> 02:37:34.972]  This will cause conversations.
[02:37:35.512 --> 02:37:37.033]  On the front, it says, Save America.
[02:37:37.898 --> 02:37:40.500]  United States flag code, so people can say, hey, what's that mean?
[02:37:41.221 --> 02:37:44.203]  And you go, well, it means, you know, the country's in distress, what's flat upside down, here's the law.
[02:37:44.944 --> 02:37:45.764]  Say, see the back.
[02:37:46.205 --> 02:37:52.230]  On the back it says, our republic is in distress, upside down flag, ask me why, InfoWars.com.
[02:37:53.263 --> 02:37:55.224]  And it's time to warn people.
[02:37:55.584 --> 02:37:58.104]  Folks always say we should start a movement to fly flags upside down.
[02:37:58.865 --> 02:38:03.126]  Well, the problem with that is most people don't fly a flag except on Memorial Day or Fourth of July.
[02:38:03.766 --> 02:38:05.527]  And your neighbors don't understand what's happening.
[02:38:06.187 --> 02:38:09.168]  This is a great way to get that conversation going.
[02:38:09.488 --> 02:38:13.989]  It's the whole point of the apparel we have is to start conversations and wear your collars proud.
[02:38:14.529 --> 02:38:17.590]  And now is the time to start wearing the flag upside down.
[02:38:18.930 --> 02:38:20.631]  And, you know, getting those conversations going.
[02:38:22.873 --> 02:38:26.055]  All right, going back to Harry Dent, I'll add one more time here.
[02:38:26.075 --> 02:38:29.797]  I want to talk about this briefly, and then I'll have the floor with the balance of the hour.
[02:38:32.158 --> 02:38:40.363]  You hear these ads, and I'm not against them, it's okay, where, get your heirloom seeds free, just shipping charge, and you call, it's $10.
[02:38:40.943 --> 02:38:42.904]  Well, to ship those seeds and handling's $4 to $5.
[02:38:43.004 --> 02:38:50.309]  Okay, fine, why don't you just say, $10 shipping included, and then you're really selling seeds for five bucks.
[02:38:51.232 --> 02:38:53.895]  I just don't like marketing schemes that aren't real.
[02:38:54.516 --> 02:38:55.277]  This is real.
[02:38:55.658 --> 02:38:58.701]  A book this size, I went and checked, $3 media mail.
[02:38:58.721 --> 02:38:59.863]  I don't even know if he ships it that way.
[02:38:59.883 --> 02:39:00.644]  He may ship it even better.
[02:39:01.285 --> 02:39:04.829]  And then at least $2 for a shipping department and handling the rest of it.
[02:39:05.230 --> 02:39:08.734]  You count the cost of a book, I bet the demographic cliff cost probably $3, $4 a print.
[02:39:11.216 --> 02:39:21.422]  He's losing money, and I know he's a successful writer and is a bestseller, so I've got to ask Mr. Harry S. Dent Jr., how are you offering a book where you lose money on it when it's already a bestseller?
[02:39:21.442 --> 02:39:22.602]  Do you just want to get it out to folks?
[02:39:22.622 --> 02:39:26.464]  Because everybody should take advantage of this at harrydentbook.com.
[02:39:27.525 --> 02:39:28.005]  Yeah, we do.
[02:39:28.085 --> 02:39:31.467]  Actually, we buy the book from the publisher, so it's more than $3.
[02:39:31.507 --> 02:39:34.669]  So we lose money on the book and we break even on the shipping.
[02:39:35.382 --> 02:39:37.823]  We just know, you know, that people get to know us.
[02:39:37.863 --> 02:39:40.425]  Somehow it'll benefit them and us down the road.
[02:39:40.625 --> 02:39:43.286]  That's, you know, so this is just, hey, you hear this?
[02:39:43.426 --> 02:39:44.487]  It sounds interesting.
[02:39:44.667 --> 02:39:52.351]  You're not going to have conviction in what I'm saying until you go in this book and look at our four key indicators and look at everything we're saying.
[02:39:52.731 --> 02:39:58.134]  Look at how the Japanese economy collapsed when we say it would, how the rest of the world is following in their footsteps.
[02:39:58.174 --> 02:40:01.256]  I mean, here, like you say, I go in a whole chapter on this.
[02:40:02.259 --> 02:40:07.182]  We've got that demographic cycle I showed earlier, generation spending and not, that's the top one.
[02:40:07.602 --> 02:40:11.164]  We got next, I came up years later with a geopolitical cycle.
[02:40:11.364 --> 02:40:18.568]  Every 18 years things are great in the world like 83 to 2000 and then we hit 9-11 and they've been terrible ever since.
[02:40:19.008 --> 02:40:23.410]  The geopolitical cycle is going to continue to get worse for the next five years.
[02:40:23.450 --> 02:40:26.492]  So anybody thinks all this terrorism and civil wars and
[02:40:26.932 --> 02:40:28.174]  Russian Ukraine is over.
[02:40:28.554 --> 02:40:34.783]  This stuff's only going to get worse and stock markets tend to be at half the valuation in a negative cycle.
[02:40:34.843 --> 02:40:37.286]  So this is another reality the market's not getting.
[02:40:37.907 --> 02:40:39.369]  Third, innovation cycle.
[02:40:39.469 --> 02:40:40.911]  We've seen the best of the internet.
[02:40:40.931 --> 02:40:42.473]  It's not that innovation is going to stop.
[02:40:43.033 --> 02:40:56.269]  But innovations matter when they move fully mainstream and affect everyday people, not just niche markets, where everybody's got the internet and broadband and an iPad and an iPhone and a smartphone and a this and that.
[02:40:56.789 --> 02:40:59.152]  And so we've seen the best gains from that.
[02:40:59.172 --> 02:41:01.475]  But finally, the most potent cycle I found.
[02:41:02.248 --> 02:41:08.093]  And only about three years ago is a boom-bust cycle that I used to follow on a rote 10-year cycle.
[02:41:08.153 --> 02:41:12.697]  And I finally found out it was actually tracked to sunspot cycles.
[02:41:12.757 --> 02:41:15.960]  And sunspot cycles are great because nobody understands them.
[02:41:16.481 --> 02:41:21.325]  And number two, scientists actually focus on predicting these cycles.
[02:41:21.845 --> 02:41:26.049]  They're not 10 years on average like the overall boom cycles have been in the last century.
[02:41:26.089 --> 02:41:26.630]  We're good.
[02:41:43.246 --> 02:41:43.966]  Great for me.
[02:41:44.366 --> 02:41:48.128]  And this cycle, all four of these point down at the same time.
[02:41:48.168 --> 02:41:50.409]  This only happened once in a generation.
[02:41:50.929 --> 02:41:52.909]  It was the early to mid-70s this happened.
[02:41:52.929 --> 02:41:57.011]  That was the worst crisis we had back then, the worst stock crash, the worst recession.
[02:41:57.451 --> 02:42:02.233]  And then, of course, the early 30s, the Great Depression hit when all four of these cycles are down.
[02:42:02.253 --> 02:42:05.514]  So my research has evolved from demographics
[02:42:06.300 --> 02:42:13.342]  But I found the other factors that really, really matter, and when all these four cycles point down, you need to understand this.
[02:42:13.382 --> 02:42:16.383]  You need to protect the assets you've gained out of this.
[02:42:16.403 --> 02:42:19.284]  I want to talk about how you do that, and I want you to walk through this.
[02:42:19.324 --> 02:42:26.666]  We're putting on screen an article from six years ago, London Guardian, where their Ministry of Defense came out, and the report's linked.
[02:42:26.686 --> 02:42:29.707]  Revolution, flash mobs, brain chips, a grim vision of the future.
[02:42:30.367 --> 02:42:32.908]  Their military actually says everything you're saying.
[02:42:33.028 --> 02:42:36.270]  Our Pentagon, in deeper reports, says what you're saying.
[02:42:36.870 --> 02:42:43.013]  The truth is, as you said, the top, you know, 1% of the 1% do understand this.
[02:42:43.113 --> 02:42:44.234]  They won't tell the public.
[02:42:44.274 --> 02:42:45.434]  I want to ask you why.
[02:42:45.454 --> 02:42:54.839]  I mean, I wish this wasn't true, but undoubtedly, unless everything changes with all their weird computers and manipulation, we're going there.
[02:42:55.139 --> 02:42:56.520]  But now we see the signs of it.
[02:42:56.740 --> 02:42:58.921]  But before we go there, let me ask you this, Mr. Dent.
[02:43:00.226 --> 02:43:04.707]  What, in your view, is the real economy rate if they say it's 0.2%?
[02:43:04.948 --> 02:43:16.251]  Well, we just put out an issue of our newsletter where we pretty much said it looks like we're already in recession starting in December or January, and the markets are acting like everything's fine.
[02:43:16.731 --> 02:43:20.872]  They're looking at lagging indicators like jobs and housing.
[02:43:20.892 --> 02:43:22.373]  Those are the last things to go.
[02:43:23.253 --> 02:43:26.856]  The leading indicators, capital investment, things like that, have been going down.
[02:43:26.936 --> 02:43:30.178]  Retail sales have been miserable, and they keep blaming it on the weather.
[02:43:30.198 --> 02:43:34.041]  Well, the cold weather is months behind us, and they're still slow.
[02:43:34.421 --> 02:43:36.662]  So, we're looking at the indicators that matter now.
[02:43:36.863 --> 02:43:39.464]  And they're saying, we're not really coming out of this.
[02:43:39.524 --> 02:43:41.966]  In fact, it looks like we're going deeper in recession.
[02:43:41.986 --> 02:43:44.448]  So, again, nobody can say this.
[02:43:44.468 --> 02:43:47.550]  When I go on normal news programs, financial news,
[02:43:48.383 --> 02:43:51.445]  I got two or three minutes and I can't say anything to convince anybody.
[02:43:51.545 --> 02:43:53.967]  Everybody else on there has some special interest.
[02:43:53.987 --> 02:43:57.410]  Stockbrokers can't tell people they'll sell their stocks and run.
[02:43:57.450 --> 02:44:00.352]  Real estate agents can't tell people the truth or they won't buy a house.
[02:44:01.012 --> 02:44:03.054]  No economist can tell people the truth.
[02:44:04.088 --> 02:44:15.917]  So, you know, that's why the only people I can affect are people that on a show like this where I get in front of you for a while and people will actually go to a seminar or read the book because what I'm saying is very contrary.
[02:44:15.937 --> 02:44:20.581]  So even people who would like to tell people can't because nobody would believe it anyway.
[02:44:20.661 --> 02:44:23.223]  So that's why we offer this free book.
[02:44:23.623 --> 02:44:26.065]  I want to show another chart you just pulled up again.
[02:44:26.963 --> 02:44:28.063]  Well, people don't understand.
[02:44:28.103 --> 02:44:30.925]  This is something that never has happened in history.
[02:44:31.405 --> 02:44:37.167]  Ever since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913, they always manipulate short-term interest rates.
[02:44:37.187 --> 02:44:42.049]  You get a slowdown, you get a stock crash, or anything goes wrong, they push short-term rates to zero.
[02:44:42.089 --> 02:44:45.150]  They make money free to help stimulate lending.
[02:44:45.760 --> 02:44:54.084]  Those zero short-term rates mainly affect investment because investors will use that to leverage up and so that causes speculation.
[02:44:54.144 --> 02:44:58.066]  What they've never done before on a mass scale is what this chart was showing.
[02:44:58.086 --> 02:45:01.187]  They have pushed long-term risk-free interest rates.
[02:45:01.207 --> 02:45:08.511]  This is a 10-year treasury bond, the risk-free longer-term bond, and it used to be before QE you get two percent
[02:45:09.051 --> 02:45:09.973]  Thank you.
[02:45:17.208 --> 02:45:18.189]  The best economists do.
[02:45:18.249 --> 02:45:27.396]  If you don't understand, every financial asset, real estate, stocks, bonds, are directly affected by how low this risk-free rate.
[02:45:27.436 --> 02:45:31.980]  The difference between 2% and 0% is huge for mortgages and for the value of real estate.
[02:45:32.020 --> 02:45:39.866]  It's huge for the value of stocks when you project the earnings for 10 years and discount them back to the present by that risk-free rate.
[02:45:40.006 --> 02:45:41.667]  There's a huge difference if it's 0% or 2%.
[02:45:42.968 --> 02:46:01.939]  What the Federal Reserve and central banks have done around the world, again, unlike any crisis in the past, they've said the solution to this debt crisis, the solution to this giant financial bubble that they created in the 80s, 90s, and 2000s, is to keep the bubble going forever, and just to make it more insane.
[02:46:02.179 --> 02:46:06.081]  So they're calling this an economic experiment?
[02:46:06.241 --> 02:46:07.542]  This is insanity!
[02:46:08.022 --> 02:46:13.764]  To create trillions of dollars and pump up assets way more than they're worth, suck everybody into them.
[02:46:13.824 --> 02:46:17.785]  Everybody thinks you can't lose money on stocks, can't lose money on real estate.
[02:46:17.845 --> 02:46:19.486]  The Federal Reserve won't let them go down.
[02:46:19.546 --> 02:46:23.607]  When this thing goes down, people are going to lose money rapidly.
[02:46:23.647 --> 02:46:26.128]  I remind people that when the tech bubble bursts,
[02:46:26.914 --> 02:46:27.355]  Very good.
[02:46:43.439 --> 02:46:48.924]  Most people will never see this coming, so it is no more important time to understand what's happening.
[02:46:49.285 --> 02:46:54.690]  The real economy has been unfavorable since late 2007 because of demographics.
[02:46:54.730 --> 02:46:59.354]  We predicted that would happen 20 years ago and predicted it would happen before it happened in Japan.
[02:46:59.375 --> 02:47:00.416]  They were the first to go down.
[02:47:00.536 --> 02:47:02.658]  Europe is next, including Germany.
[02:47:03.158 --> 02:47:04.359]  So the fundamentals are bad.
[02:47:04.399 --> 02:47:06.321]  We had the greatest debt bubble in history.
[02:47:06.442 --> 02:47:12.948]  Debt grew at 2.6 times GDP for 25 years from 1983 to 2008.
[02:47:13.889 --> 02:47:20.096]  Any economist that doesn't think that's a problem in a crisis brewing, we've never had debt grow that fast, that long.
[02:47:20.416 --> 02:47:21.918]  Harry Dent is our guest.
[02:47:22.918 --> 02:47:24.338]  Harry, let me ask you this question.
[02:47:25.419 --> 02:47:27.439]  Obviously the elites are digging in with the police state.
[02:47:27.599 --> 02:47:28.859]  They think it's going to protect them.
[02:47:29.460 --> 02:47:43.803]  But if you've got people in the Depression starving to death when they were somewhat self-sufficient, what's going to happen today with this entitlement society by the middle class, by the elites, by the hundred million people that are on food assistance in the U.S., 101 million?
[02:47:44.503 --> 02:47:47.084]  It seems like a perfect storm once this all unravels.
[02:47:47.104 --> 02:47:47.204]  A. B.
[02:47:49.381 --> 02:47:50.622]  Central banks have been caught.
[02:47:50.662 --> 02:47:51.282]  It's in the news.
[02:47:51.703 --> 02:47:56.646]  They're going to be meeting in a few weeks, secretly in London, to push to ban cash worldwide.
[02:47:56.666 --> 02:47:58.147]  They've already been pushing it openly.
[02:47:58.687 --> 02:48:01.529]  So those two points, how bad will it get?
[02:48:01.549 --> 02:48:03.430]  I mean, I know it's on average.
[02:48:03.470 --> 02:48:05.351]  I know there's a hundred ways this can happen.
[02:48:06.345 --> 02:48:16.812]  But how does the decadence, the entitlement, the whole just-in-time-to-market fragility of the system affect it?
[02:48:17.593 --> 02:48:21.776]  And then how does that tie in to the other points that I was bringing up?
[02:48:22.947 --> 02:48:26.990]  Well, you know, this is going to be a global crisis because it's a global bubble.
[02:48:27.070 --> 02:48:28.932]  Stocks everywhere, real estate everywhere.
[02:48:28.972 --> 02:48:37.239]  And it's when real estate crashes that you get the worst problems because real estate is financed and now heavily, often with no money down, by mortgages.
[02:48:37.279 --> 02:48:38.540]  So it's heavily levered.
[02:48:39.020 --> 02:48:43.283]  So that's why the last downturn was so bad, because real estate crashed.
[02:48:43.303 --> 02:48:46.065]  But real estate is yet to crash in most cities around the world.
[02:48:46.445 --> 02:48:48.006]  So that's going to be the first reality.
[02:48:48.026 --> 02:48:49.487]  It's not just stocks that go down.
[02:48:49.547 --> 02:48:51.568]  People don't get hit as hard when stocks go down.
[02:48:51.948 --> 02:48:52.889]  Real estate goes down.
[02:48:52.949 --> 02:48:54.370]  The banking system gets hit.
[02:48:54.430 --> 02:48:55.391]  People are underwater.
[02:48:55.411 --> 02:48:56.571]  They can't refinance.
[02:48:57.312 --> 02:49:03.816]  Now, the two areas I'm most worried about, because we've already seen Europe go through part of this crisis and Japan now for decades.
[02:49:04.699 --> 02:49:11.204]  Those are very civil places with older populations and not as much kind of crime and violence.
[02:49:12.124 --> 02:49:16.427]  I worry about the United States because we have a very polarized society.
[02:49:16.447 --> 02:49:18.729]  The rich have been getting richer, the poor have been getting poorer.
[02:49:18.749 --> 02:49:20.850]  Like you say, you've got all these entitlements built up.
[02:49:21.371 --> 02:49:24.973]  The top 0.1% controls massive amounts of wealth.
[02:49:26.334 --> 02:49:32.279]  And so I think there's going to be that polarized situation is going to lead to some level of civil unrest.
[02:49:32.319 --> 02:49:34.160]  And then of course, I'm most worried about China.
[02:49:34.540 --> 02:49:44.687]  For those 250 million people with no skills who are going to have to squat in an unfinished apartment and can't even move back to their rice paddies because they've been paved over with nothing.
[02:49:44.707 --> 02:49:45.868]  They're going to be trapped.
[02:49:46.828 --> 02:49:53.753]  And so I do think people have to worry not just protect your investment, where you live, you want to live
[02:49:54.574 --> 02:49:56.235]  Farther out rather than farther in.
[02:49:56.275 --> 02:50:01.516]  You want to live between the Allegheny Mountains and the Rocky Mountains and not on the coast if you can.
[02:50:01.537 --> 02:50:10.960]  I think we are going to see some level of civil unrest, even though people can argue, oh, Japan's been through this for two and a half decades and they haven't seen civil unrest.
[02:50:11.420 --> 02:50:13.002]  They're an older society.
[02:50:13.022 --> 02:50:17.086]  The Japanese didn't rob each other when their country was all bombed to the ground.
[02:50:17.566 --> 02:50:20.449]  So they act better when they're attacked instead of we act worse.
[02:50:20.469 --> 02:50:21.410]  Let's just be honest about it.
[02:50:21.671 --> 02:50:22.251]  We're going to break.
[02:50:22.311 --> 02:50:24.113]  I want to ask you this question, and you're right.
[02:50:24.133 --> 02:50:28.778]  The elites are moving off the coast into the middle of the country, into the Ozarks and stuff, and building redoubts.
[02:50:29.198 --> 02:50:33.062]  I mean, that's got to concern people, and billionaires are doing that across the board.
[02:50:34.144 --> 02:50:48.082]  But I want to ask you, the White House strategy, I know you're not political on these issues, but the White House and Soros and others really are trying to get a summer of rage, entitlement, class warfare going when they're some of the most entitled people out there.
[02:50:48.402 --> 02:50:51.666]  What's the strategy behind that with Mr. Dent?
[02:50:52.347 --> 02:50:56.850]  Straight ahead, you can get his book free, except for $5, $4.95 shipping and handling.
[02:50:57.230 --> 02:50:58.951]  What's your health worth to you?
[02:50:59.252 --> 02:51:04.555]  You probably can't place an exact value on it, but its importance has certainly increased greatly as you've grown older.
[02:51:04.755 --> 02:51:09.058]  Yet some companies seem to believe you can be lured in with cheap prices and false promises.
[02:51:09.318 --> 02:51:12.680]  That's never been the way Supernatural Silver has chosen to do business.
[02:51:12.940 --> 02:51:17.984]  Long ago, we set out to create a product that was light years beyond colloidal and ionic silver.
[02:51:18.204 --> 02:51:24.688]  Through extensive research and testing, we succeeded in making Supernatural Silver hundreds of times more effective.
[02:51:24.808 --> 02:51:29.412]  Some might call us a premium product, but we've simply strived to be a product that worked.
[02:51:29.692 --> 02:51:37.377]  Supernatural Silver is strong enough to fight off viruses, bacteria, and fungus, but safe enough to be used internally or topically.
[02:51:37.597 --> 02:51:44.445]  And it's powerful enough that just a handful of applications per week can give you better results than the daily use of those bargain silvers.
[02:51:44.725 --> 02:51:51.512]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com today and use the promo code SILVER2015 for 30% off your order.
[02:51:51.813 --> 02:51:56.298]  Give yourself and your loved ones a fighting chance with Supernatural Silver.
[02:51:56.938 --> 02:51:58.659]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[02:51:58.859 --> 02:52:02.200]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[02:52:02.501 --> 02:52:03.481]  A pair of scissors.
[02:52:03.861 --> 02:52:09.363]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[02:52:09.644 --> 02:52:14.326]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[02:52:14.586 --> 02:52:15.386]  The phone line.
[02:52:15.566 --> 02:52:20.488]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[02:52:20.808 --> 02:52:24.550]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[02:52:24.730 --> 02:52:27.613]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[02:52:28.034 --> 02:52:30.296]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[02:52:30.497 --> 02:52:34.702]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[02:52:34.842 --> 02:52:35.743]  Scissors can't cut it.
[02:52:35.943 --> 02:52:38.386]  And that means your home stays safe.
[02:52:38.406 --> 02:52:41.990]  24-7 professional monitoring is under $15 a month with no contract.
[02:52:42.190 --> 02:52:45.535]  SimpliSafe Home Security keeps you safer than the other guys.

[02:52:56.650 --> 02:52:59.692]  Did you know some countries are now banning GMO foods?
[02:53:00.052 --> 02:53:00.592]  It's true.
[02:53:00.872 --> 02:53:04.775]  That's why for quality storable foods, you need Ready Made Resources.
[02:53:05.075 --> 02:53:10.978]  For over 19 years, we've become the name you can trust for thousands of products, like NuMana Healthy Food Storage.

[02:53:15.201 --> 02:53:20.383]  Call 800-627-3809 or click readymaderesources.com.
[02:53:20.584 --> 02:53:21.804]  Ready Made Resources.
[02:53:22.305 --> 02:53:24.626]  We don't just sell the products, we live it.
[02:53:26.249 --> 02:53:30.911]  Are you tired of being cyber-raped by big government and big business?
[02:53:31.231 --> 02:53:37.394]  Are you tired of being forced to cough up information, private, personal information, against your will?
[02:53:37.574 --> 02:53:40.236]  Well, I found the answer to their invasive behaviors.
[02:53:40.516 --> 02:53:41.656]  It's called D-vasive.
[02:53:41.756 --> 02:53:43.697]  D- or D-vasive.
[02:53:44.178 --> 02:53:46.098]  It's made for PCs and Androids.
[02:53:46.479 --> 02:53:48.340]  Go get it now at the Google Play Store.
[02:53:48.400 --> 02:53:49.900]  D-vasive.
[02:53:49.940 --> 02:53:50.541]  D-vasive.
[02:53:50.721 --> 02:53:51.521]  D-vasive.
[02:53:51.601 --> 02:53:52.181]  It's an app.
[02:53:52.261 --> 02:53:55.463]  Get it now and turn Big Brother off.
[02:54:01.039 --> 02:54:06.742]  I don't want to give up too much info on air.
[02:54:22.403 --> 02:54:30.879]  But generally, if we have some intel privately, we can just go search it and find it somewhere else in mainstream news or alternative news or in a C-SPAN statement or something.
[02:54:30.919 --> 02:54:32.582]  But the whole Carnegie Mellon family...
[02:54:34.062 --> 02:54:49.207]  And their foundations have been moving into diversified portfolios, into digital, into a bunch of other things, into farmland, things like that, for quite a while, and are predicting a massive crash by the end of next year.
[02:54:49.927 --> 02:54:59.331]  And then I was separately talking to a source about this, and we did a search, and Nico is in there printing it, because I'd forgotten to do this, and there's an article mentioning something in that area.
[02:54:59.371 --> 02:55:03.252]  So, all I'm saying is the elite are acting like it's the end of the world.
[02:55:04.401 --> 02:55:09.743]  And then they have national news attacking us because we cover this saying we're insane, nothing's going to happen, everything's fine.
[02:55:10.623 --> 02:55:12.023]  Man, I would love to be wrong.
[02:55:12.063 --> 02:55:13.143]  But see, I'm not wrong.
[02:55:13.304 --> 02:55:15.524]  I'm going off what the big money is doing.
[02:55:17.085 --> 02:55:22.686]  And there's even an article, The Future of Money, BNY Mellon, The Next Generation of Currency.
[02:55:23.206 --> 02:55:24.827]  They're pushing there's going to be a collapse.
[02:55:24.867 --> 02:55:25.547]  Go to digital.
[02:55:27.816 --> 02:55:34.865]  Again, they're global STR out of the crisis, and they've got the big banks openly meeting and pushing and making statements about banning cash.
[02:55:35.246 --> 02:55:43.357]  What's up with the war on cash, and how is the different arms of the establishment, Harry Dent, going to try to ride this crisis into more power?
[02:55:44.997 --> 02:55:47.499]  Well, you know, everybody wants to keep this bubble.
[02:55:47.639 --> 02:55:49.420]  Again, it's been created for decades now.
[02:55:49.480 --> 02:55:50.921]  They want to keep it going.
[02:55:50.941 --> 02:55:52.882]  You can't keep a bubble going forever.
[02:55:52.922 --> 02:55:59.005]  This is an impossible task, but people will do desperate things, like the government just keeps printing more money.
[02:55:59.045 --> 02:56:06.230]  Well, every time they have to up the ante, they have to do double, and then triple, and that's what the Japanese have been doing, and now the Europeans.
[02:56:06.850 --> 02:56:14.273]  And so all of this stuff is strategies that just try to keep this going at least until the next administration or the next group gets in.
[02:56:14.633 --> 02:56:17.515]  Nobody wants to have the next Great Depression on their watch.
[02:56:17.555 --> 02:56:24.778]  I mean, you can't blame people for that, but that's why nobody's telling you the truth and everybody just hopes we can keep this thing going.
[02:56:24.838 --> 02:56:27.159]  You cannot keep this thing going.
[02:56:27.199 --> 02:56:28.339]  Well, answer my question.
[02:56:28.359 --> 02:56:34.622]  I mean, I know you like to go off scientific stuff and graphs and facts and you make accurate predictions, but you're a smart guy separately from that.
[02:56:35.282 --> 02:56:40.508]  They're clearly activating leftist goon mobs, communist race baiters for riots.
[02:56:40.889 --> 02:56:45.414]  Why would the White House, Justice Department, and George Soros want to play with fire like that?
[02:56:45.794 --> 02:56:46.816]  What is the strategy there?
[02:56:48.271 --> 02:56:58.615]  You know, I don't know about Soros, but anybody in the political establishment will do what it takes to benefit them, especially in a difficult situation.
[02:56:58.695 --> 02:57:05.498]  So I mean, I don't get, like you said, on the political side as much because as soon as I get too political, I alienate half the people.
[02:57:05.578 --> 02:57:11.301]  So I just say, look, I can tell you what's going to happen over the rest of your lifetime today.
[02:57:11.721 --> 02:57:16.683]  Our four cycles will show you where the economy's headed over the rest of your lifetime, your kid's lifetime.
[02:57:16.983 --> 02:57:18.504]  For your business, everything.
[02:57:18.845 --> 02:57:20.326]  So why wouldn't you want to know that?
[02:57:20.386 --> 02:57:23.669]  These are objective indicators that make sense.
[02:57:24.209 --> 02:57:28.653]  But undoubtedly, whether it's this year or next year, all hell's getting ready to break loose.
[02:57:29.294 --> 02:57:34.298]  Yeah, our show in the short term, we show that the danger period is 2015 and 16.
[02:57:34.939 --> 02:57:37.261]  And then again in 2018 and 19.
[02:57:37.521 --> 02:57:40.243]  Those are probably the most dangerous years ahead.
[02:57:40.383 --> 02:57:42.785]  And I think the worst are likely to be in the next two.
[02:57:42.865 --> 02:57:44.567]  So I would agree with that report earlier that
[02:57:45.047 --> 02:57:54.875]  By the end of 2016, we're likely to see something major occur, so you can't afford to wait here and say, well, I'll wait and see, and then I'll prepare.
[02:57:55.115 --> 02:57:56.236]  You better prepare now.
[02:57:57.837 --> 02:57:58.498]  Absolutely.

[02:58:11.401 --> 02:58:13.623]  Basically, the best thing to do is to be in cash.
[02:58:13.723 --> 02:58:19.628]  I also buy options where I can say, I'm willing to lose this amount of money, but I'm going to make ten times my money.
[02:58:19.648 --> 02:58:28.075]  When the markets have been going up this much with little volatility, you can buy, if you sit, talk to a professional, you can buy... I'll tell you what, can you do five more minutes on what you're doing?
[02:58:29.236 --> 02:58:29.756]  One minute break?
[02:58:29.776 --> 02:58:30.857]  Okay, we'll do a one minute break.

[02:59:49.432 --> 02:59:53.636]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:59.662 --> 03:00:05.687]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:06.288 --> 03:00:09.270]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:11.644 --> 03:00:12.665]  Alright, final segment.
[03:00:12.765 --> 03:00:13.385]  Overdrive.
[03:00:13.445 --> 03:00:14.806]  Harry Dent is here with us.
[03:00:14.826 --> 03:00:16.648]  harrydentbook.com to get a free copy.
[03:00:16.988 --> 03:00:17.148]  Only $4.95.
[03:00:17.188 --> 03:00:19.130]  That pays for the shipping and handling.
[03:00:19.710 --> 03:00:21.491]  And then he loses money because they had to print the book.
[03:00:21.531 --> 03:00:23.413]  So that's... He's losing probably $5.
[03:00:23.533 --> 03:00:24.614]  He says to buy from the publisher.
[03:00:25.374 --> 03:00:26.615]  Probably like $10 he's losing.
[03:00:26.975 --> 03:00:27.956]  But he wants you to read the book.
[03:00:28.016 --> 03:00:28.777]  It's so important.
[03:00:29.725 --> 03:00:33.408]  And it's about as accurate as you're going to get following demographics.
[03:00:33.488 --> 03:00:34.388]  It's what the elite do.
[03:00:34.448 --> 03:00:35.289]  They all know this.
[03:00:35.989 --> 03:00:39.492]  So we're talking about something that that he's helped, you know, codify.
[03:00:39.752 --> 03:00:40.772]  So he has trailblazed.
[03:00:40.812 --> 03:00:46.376]  But quite frankly, I read globalist reports, Pentagon reports, stuff that Carol Quigley wrote, you know, in the 60s.
[03:00:46.396 --> 03:00:48.778]  And they talk about all this, things that Brzezinski wrote.
[03:00:49.178 --> 03:00:54.682]  And the four minutes we have left, sir, you're saying basically gambling off knowledge you have.
[03:00:55.859 --> 03:01:04.048]  On the market, on specific things, with money you can lose, is one of the most successful things you could do, but most people don't know how to do that.
[03:01:04.088 --> 03:01:11.936]  So what else, what would you say, I mean not individual advice, but what would you advise just in general terms for the general public?
[03:01:12.304 --> 03:01:13.325]  You know, there's a couple areas.
[03:01:13.345 --> 03:01:19.328]  You know, in a boom, you sit there and you sit down with a financial advisor and say, OK, how do I diversify and play the upside?
[03:01:19.668 --> 03:01:21.489]  Well, the downside is just the opposite.
[03:01:21.909 --> 03:01:23.750]  And it gets more narrow.
[03:01:23.790 --> 03:01:24.951]  There's fewer things will do well.
[03:01:25.011 --> 03:01:32.215]  I tell people, number one thing most people should be doing is just get more of their real estate and stocks and financial assets.
[03:01:32.795 --> 03:01:33.656]  In cash!
[03:01:34.056 --> 03:01:40.039]  Cash preserves the value after a bubble and then when everything crashes you can buy stuff at 10, 20, 30 cents on the dollar.
[03:01:40.419 --> 03:01:43.681]  So that's number one, just cash and very safe short-term bonds.
[03:01:44.101 --> 03:01:49.684]  Number two, we've been saying this for years, the dollar benefits from the deleveraging of all this debt.
[03:01:49.824 --> 03:01:53.646]  There are going to be a lot of dollars and debts and dollars are going to be destroyed and have been.
[03:01:53.906 --> 03:01:58.389]  The dollar is going to go up, not the euro, not the Swiss franc, not every other currency.
[03:01:58.989 --> 03:02:04.038]  Now, the dollar's been going down lately, so we're looking for another opportunity for people to bet on the U.S.
[03:02:04.078 --> 03:02:04.719]  dollar going up.
[03:02:04.739 --> 03:02:06.783]  There's an ETF called UUP.
[03:02:07.163 --> 03:02:08.205]  It follows the U.S.
[03:02:08.225 --> 03:02:08.566]  dollar.
[03:02:09.150 --> 03:02:12.652]  Third, to some minor amount, because people shouldn't be speculating.
[03:02:13.133 --> 03:02:18.576]  Some percentage of your portfolio, 10-20%, you can use it just basically bet on stocks going down.
[03:02:18.596 --> 03:02:23.939]  You can buy an inverse ETF, like SH, goes the opposite of the S&P 500.
[03:02:23.979 --> 03:02:32.665]  So if stocks go down, and remember what I said earlier, stocks go down at least twice as fast as they go up even in a bubble, then you make some money on a small-amounted portfolio.
[03:02:32.685 --> 03:02:37.848]  And to be really sophisticated, you can set up options or futures and things where you risk a little amount of money
[03:02:38.488 --> 03:02:41.309]  And it's what some people call asymmetric returns.
[03:02:41.389 --> 03:02:52.351]  As I said earlier, stocks have been going up with so little volatility, you can buy some of these futures and options sort of things with a little money, very cheaply, and only put a little money at risk.
[03:02:52.391 --> 03:02:57.432]  But again, you should do that as an entire strategy and sit down with somebody who knows what they're doing.
[03:02:57.472 --> 03:03:00.093]  You shouldn't just run off this show and say, oh, I'm going to go buy now.
[03:03:00.373 --> 03:03:01.014]  That'd be absurd.
[03:03:01.034 --> 03:03:01.154]  Yeah.
[03:03:01.174 --> 03:03:04.037]  Yeah, Joseph Kennedy was a great example in the early 30s.
[03:03:04.157 --> 03:03:05.278]  And here's the point, Alex.
[03:03:21.047 --> 03:03:23.828]  You have to have cash or something producing cash flow.
[03:03:23.948 --> 03:03:27.649]  Nobody's going to lend you money when the world looks like it's going down the tube.
[03:03:28.010 --> 03:03:33.051]  So it's the people who have cash and liquid assets that can walk in to situations that are failing.
[03:03:33.072 --> 03:03:38.193]  You can literally say a business like, buy your competitor out at 10 cents on the dollar, 20 cents on the dollar.
[03:03:38.534 --> 03:03:39.294]  Buy stocks.
[03:03:39.354 --> 03:03:43.335]  At the bottom of the Great Depression, stocks, blue chip stocks, were down 89%.
[03:03:45.456 --> 03:03:49.240]  Imagine buying great long-term companies at that rate.
[03:03:49.340 --> 03:03:56.426]  I like the cash thing because you sleep at night, you're not taking any risk, you wait for things to fall apart, then you start buying.
[03:03:56.486 --> 03:03:57.827]  What about the bail-in though?
[03:03:57.868 --> 03:04:00.650]  More and more they're trying to launch this thing now in Greece.
[03:04:01.030 --> 03:04:03.653]  They're talking about federalizing pension funds to quote protect them.
[03:04:04.133 --> 03:04:06.696]  How do you keep them from pirating your cash in the future?
[03:04:07.316 --> 03:04:11.540]  Yeah, well, don't have it sitting in a normal commercial bank account or deposit account.
[03:04:11.560 --> 03:04:20.328]  You have your money, even if it's in safe, cash-like investments or money markets or CDs or whatever, you have it in an investment account under your name.
[03:04:20.388 --> 03:04:22.410]  That's not something a bank can lend against.
[03:04:22.730 --> 03:04:31.779]  It's not like something like in Cyprus or Greece, where banks or governments can come in and say, oh, we're just going to take 10% of all deposits of people over.
[03:04:31.799 --> 03:04:32.740]  Yeah, really good advice.
[03:04:33.340 --> 03:04:37.122]  I don't have a lot of assets, but to back up this company and operation, I have some reserves.
[03:04:37.162 --> 03:04:40.503]  I do exactly what you're saying, and that's when you buy is when markets are down.
[03:04:40.543 --> 03:04:43.944]  You don't buy when they're up, but folks don't listen to that for whatever reason.
[03:04:44.185 --> 03:04:45.285]  Mr. Dent, thank you so much.
[03:04:45.305 --> 03:04:46.626]  Look forward to speaking to you again in the future.
[03:04:47.226 --> 03:04:48.026]  Okay, thank you, Alex.
[03:04:48.386 --> 03:04:51.708]  Yeah, his predictions are coming true, ladies and gentlemen, so congratulations on that.
