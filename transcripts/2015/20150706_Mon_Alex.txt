[00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.369]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:08.130]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.890]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.470]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.030]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.211]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.211 --> 00:00:24.772]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.772 --> 00:00:26.853]  Here are the headlines.
[00:00:26.853 --> 00:00:29.673]  You're listening to this broadcast.
[00:00:29.673 --> 00:00:33.754]  You've got the breakdown on the upcoming EU meltdown years ago.
[00:00:35.993 --> 00:00:38.154]  And now it's here.
[00:00:38.154 --> 00:00:43.436]  Greek banks prepare a plan to raid deposits to avert collapse.
[00:00:43.436 --> 00:00:48.839]  No, raiding people's deposits will cause the collapse to be even worse.
[00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:54.061]  But that's how the Financial Times of London spins the tyranny of the megabanks.
[00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:55.962]  Sugar, flour, rice.
[00:00:55.962 --> 00:01:01.444]  Panic Greek stock up on essentials as store shelves go barren AFP.
[00:01:04.727 --> 00:01:10.030]  And it just gets more insane from there.
[00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:24.979]  Drug companies threatened to not supply drugs to the nation even though they were paying for them, but they're still supplying them after no vote, but only one day later they're threatening to cut off digital wire transfers, embargo goods.
[00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.021]  We're talking about war crimes here.
[00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:29.062]  Greek no vote.
[00:01:29.994 --> 00:01:33.876]  poses Germany's Chancellor's biggest challenge yet.
[00:01:33.876 --> 00:01:46.761]  The Wall Street Journal reports, getting the Germans to bail out the EU yet again when it's designed to implode, but not before they've milked the nation states over and over again.
[00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:55.285]  Bloomberg Business reports, 48 hours away from unrest in Greece that will then spread, and the EU is announcing unlimited illegals
[00:01:55.945 --> 00:01:59.869]  Out of Eastern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, pouring in.
[00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.794]  And the EU heads have demanded more.
[00:02:05.794 --> 00:02:06.635]  More.
[00:02:06.635 --> 00:02:08.416]  Pay for everything.
[00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:15.803]  As Spain and Italy and Portugal and France prepare to go belly up.
[00:02:15.803 --> 00:02:19.887]  Get in as many foreigners as we can before the lifeboat sinks.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.426]  So the leftists can then milk the civil unrest and play the different groups off against each other.
[00:02:29.426 --> 00:02:34.511]  Greek contagion across markets muted as crisis seen quarantine.
[00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:37.994]  Those stock markets are down around the world right now.
[00:02:39.502 --> 00:02:41.843]  That is just some of what we have on that front.
[00:02:41.843 --> 00:02:52.567]  Nigel Farage, leader of the UKIP party, basically a Ron Paul, InfoWars-style party, frequent guest of this broadcast, says, uh, Greece votes no.
[00:02:52.567 --> 00:02:56.329]  The European Union is dying before our eyes.
[00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.790]  That's coming up first after the break.
[00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.853]  If you go to InfoWars.com, we break it all down.
[00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:09.422]  U.S.
[00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:15.704]  preparing coup to prevent Greece from falling under Russian influence.
[00:03:15.704 --> 00:03:20.565]  If you don't go under the globalists, you must be working for the Russkies.
[00:03:20.565 --> 00:03:24.026]  Kind of like Egypt now does drills with Russia because the U.S.
[00:03:24.026 --> 00:03:36.870]  betrayed them, overthrew their government, and put the Muslim Brotherhood and Wahhabists in charge to blow up every church they could find, chop Christians' heads off, crucify them upside down, and attack military bases.
[00:03:38.237 --> 00:03:46.807]  With Anderson Cooper cheering him on as freedom fighters, just like Libya was liberated by Al Qaeda as well, now known as ISIS.
[00:03:46.807 --> 00:03:55.217]  But Christie, the bizarre governor of New Jersey, wants Americans to blame Rand Paul for terror attacks that haven't happened yet.
[00:03:55.217 --> 00:03:57.840]  This is the inverted reality, and we have this clip coming up.
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.062]  He doesn't even say why Rand Paul's to blame.
[00:04:02.062 --> 00:04:05.244]  Rand Paul tried to stop arming Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:12.528]  Rand Paul's the one for four years exposing it valiantly, along with this broadcast and others.
[00:04:12.528 --> 00:04:14.549]  I'm just giving the listeners credit here.
[00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:23.915]  And so he just, without any evidence or reason or logic, it's like saying, you know, the house burns down in New York today.
[00:04:23.915 --> 00:04:24.956]  It's Alex Jones's fault.
[00:04:26.872 --> 00:04:32.816]  If your child sprains their ankle sometime this year, uh, Rand Paul did it.
[00:04:32.816 --> 00:04:36.438]  Or if your soup's cold at a restaurant five years from now, Matt Drudge did it.
[00:04:36.438 --> 00:04:39.640]  I mean, it's just, he just, you know, Rand Paul's gonna cause a terror attack.
[00:04:41.673 --> 00:04:45.419]  Of course, he's really getting at the fact that he doesn't want illegal spying on everybody.
[00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:53.370]  It hasn't stopped any other attacks because our government is rogue in every sensible term.
[00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.736]  Get ready, it's a big broadcast today as we watch the global meltdown accelerate.
[00:04:59.116 --> 00:05:09.122]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[00:05:09.122 --> 00:05:11.043]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:05:11.043 --> 00:05:11.804]  Think about it.
[00:05:11.804 --> 00:05:17.827]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:05:17.827 --> 00:05:18.748]  But on the other hand,
[00:05:19.188 --> 00:05:23.711]  The Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:35.818]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:05:35.818 --> 00:05:38.800]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.582]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:05:41.582 --> 00:05:46.465]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:05:46.465 --> 00:05:47.025]  Think about it.
[00:05:47.245 --> 00:05:59.097]  This is Darren McBreen and I want you to break the matrix at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and listen to the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on in your mind.
[00:05:59.097 --> 00:06:02.600]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.665]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[00:06:07.805 --> 00:06:10.827]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:06:10.827 --> 00:06:16.231]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:06:16.231 --> 00:06:18.773]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:06:18.773 --> 00:06:20.874]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:30.080]  Alex Jones here.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:39.366]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:06:39.366 --> 00:06:43.169]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:51.515]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.

[00:06:53.857 --> 00:06:54.857]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:59.256 --> 00:07:05.359]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:07:05.359 --> 00:07:09.961]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[00:07:09.961 --> 00:07:17.664]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:23.429]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:07:23.429 --> 00:07:29.375]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:34.340]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.923]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:07:38.263 --> 00:07:44.868]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:07:44.868 --> 00:07:50.031]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:53.273]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:53.273 --> 00:07:55.655]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:08:11.994 --> 00:08:18.378]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:18.378 --> 00:08:35.149]  Surfing towards the apocalypse, financial armageddon.
[00:08:36.536 --> 00:08:48.625]  It's an absolute certainty that the biggest bubbles the world has ever seen in bonds, stocks and currencies will implode at some point.
[00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:51.587]  The only question is what will cause it.
[00:08:51.587 --> 00:08:59.032]  And the situation we see unfolding in Greece could be the big one.
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.101]  We've got Gerald Cilente joining us in the third hour.
[00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:11.423]  We're getting Lord Monckton on, who helped found and create the UKIP party, to give us his breakdown on what's happening to the euro.
[00:09:11.423 --> 00:09:19.346]  The head of UKIP, which again is the Ron Paul Libertarian Party of Europe now, fastest growing, which shows Europe's waking up.
[00:09:19.346 --> 00:09:23.207]  Super popular now in the UK, in France, in Italy.
[00:09:24.468 --> 00:09:26.890]  Greece votes no Saturday.
[00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.032]  The results were in by Sunday.
[00:09:29.032 --> 00:09:32.336]  The European Union is dying before our eyes.
[00:09:32.336 --> 00:09:35.659]  It's not just disaffected pensioners.
[00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:39.563]  Young Greeks have worked out that they don't need the bloated EU.
[00:09:41.015 --> 00:09:41.395]  That's right.
[00:09:41.395 --> 00:09:45.337]  You can try to blame the Greeks and say they've got too big a pension funds.
[00:09:45.337 --> 00:09:47.438]  Well, the general public doesn't have pension funds.
[00:09:47.438 --> 00:09:49.839]  They have very high taxes in Greece.
[00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:59.163]  And the EU wanted to raise even more taxes selectively on them to not just bail out Greece's debts, but the rest of the EU debts.
[00:09:59.163 --> 00:10:03.405]  And no one's had to pay for more of the private derivatives, fiat,
[00:10:04.557 --> 00:10:25.536]  counterfeit garbage than the Germans, then it's the Americans, and then it's the Chinese taxpayer that have pumped tens of trillions of dollars and yens and yons and euros into propping up what JP Morgan and others have created.
[00:10:25.536 --> 00:10:28.218]  2.2 quadrillion in fraudulent instruments.
[00:10:28.218 --> 00:10:31.421]  Now, when you're Bernie Madoff and you create a couple hundred billion,
[00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:45.715]  in fraudulent garbage, you end up going to prison for the tens of billions of it that was fraud.
[00:10:45.715 --> 00:10:48.576]  But when you're the head of Goldman Sachs or J.P.
[00:10:48.576 --> 00:10:56.260]  Morgan, you run the federal banking commissions and you go and sit in the hearings and tell them how to fix everything.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.360]  And back then, Treasury Secretary, in 2008, Paulson
[00:11:00.706 --> 00:11:12.294]  This came out in mainstream news, went into closed session of Congress and said there will be tanks and blood in the streets within 48 hours if you don't give us unlimited capital.
[00:11:12.294 --> 00:11:25.604]  And it wasn't just the $878 billion they wanted, it was the unlimited open window at the market committee of the Federal Reserve and it was the green light to be protected
[00:11:26.994 --> 00:11:32.370]  And to have the public sign on to the current derivatives and all future derivatives.
[00:11:36.104 --> 00:11:39.505]  And the Wall Street Journal did carry that back at the time in an article.
[00:11:39.505 --> 00:11:42.085]  Shock forced Paulson's hand.
[00:11:42.085 --> 00:11:43.606]  Oh yes, they were so shocked.
[00:11:43.606 --> 00:11:47.146]  No, they orchestrated that whole situation.
[00:11:47.146 --> 00:11:56.028]  Even the head of the Texas Banking Association has written articles exposing that and they've taken over most of the brokerage firms, most of the regional banks, most of the small banks.
[00:11:56.028 --> 00:11:57.869]  Now they want the credit unions.
[00:11:57.869 --> 00:12:03.490]  The big six banks globally are taking out their competition and want to move towards getting rid of cash.
[00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:11.632]  So you're forced to stay in the banks so they can take whatever money they want directly out of your bank accounts.
[00:12:11.632 --> 00:12:13.432]  And you're saying, oh really, that'll never happen.
[00:12:13.432 --> 00:12:14.153]  Oh really?
[00:12:14.153 --> 00:12:16.193]  This is what they're calling for at Davos.
[00:12:16.193 --> 00:12:24.635]  This is what they're trying to normalize in the media with trial balloons to acclimate the sheeple in the last few months.
[00:12:24.635 --> 00:12:27.276]  Here it is, Financial Times of London.
[00:12:27.276 --> 00:12:31.337]  Greek banks prepare plan to raid deposits to avert collapse.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:39.565]  If you raid deposits, historically, that's what destroys confidence.
[00:12:39.565 --> 00:12:55.155]  Which, if you get the documents from 2002 that were leaked from the World Bank and IMF, when Joseph Stiklitz left, not saying he leaked them, they just got released, there was a plan to then do this in the next coming decade or so in the West.
[00:12:58.012 --> 00:13:10.562]  They've done this tactic with third world countries, buying off the politicians, getting them to sign on to debt, getting them to invest pension funds, public and private, in derivatives.
[00:13:10.562 --> 00:13:20.750]  Once they're infected, even one or two percent, no one can tell you how much you've got to sign on to the thousands of trillions and growing.
[00:13:22.495 --> 00:13:24.296]  Or it all fails.
[00:13:24.296 --> 00:13:40.106]  So see, they infect it, get you to then sign on to it, and then government can come in with regulatory power to save the too-big-to-fail facade, which is actually designed to fail down the road, and get bailout after bailout after bailout to the private central banks.
[00:13:40.106 --> 00:13:46.670]  That's really a open tax, directly from taxpayers to the private central banks.
[00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:47.951]  That's always been their dream.
[00:13:49.878 --> 00:14:16.915]  But when this system finally fails, when they've milked us over and over and over again, they will propose the new global currency, which they're modeling after the strategic drawing right, which is another way of Madoff style, made up Ponzi scheme derivatives that are digital zeros and ones in a computer.
[00:14:16.915 --> 00:14:17.235]  That's it.
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:24.501]  And then every global currency that's faltering signs on to that to be stabilized for a time.
[00:14:24.501 --> 00:14:31.462]  They will then back off the economy, let prosperity flourish for a while after they've already consolidated all the countries they've imploded.
[00:14:31.462 --> 00:14:36.263]  They'll roll out for a decade or so in prosperity, getting us deeper into debt.
[00:14:36.263 --> 00:14:44.885]  It'll be fake prosperity, faux prosperity, synthetic prosperity, and then the mega hammer will be dropped.
[00:14:45.882 --> 00:15:09.400]  And they will fully get rid of the previous currencies that were in place, rolling them in to the new super global digital cashless currency after a decade of the public being trained to thumbprint and face scan to buy and sell and that cash is the devil and that cash is the enemy and that people running on European and US and North American banks caused the collapse of 2016 or 2017.
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.802]  They always blame the free market.
[00:15:15.802 --> 00:15:18.944]  They always blame freedom for what they've publicly done.
[00:15:18.944 --> 00:15:26.931]  And they always sign the public on to their debts.
[00:15:26.931 --> 00:15:30.374]  So here's what I want to do in this first hour.
[00:15:30.374 --> 00:15:42.024]  I want to open the phones up to take your phone calls for first-time callers specifically on the Greek situation and where you think it's going.
[00:15:43.174 --> 00:15:47.876]  And do you think it's going to be this fall, this winter, that we really see the implosion?
[00:15:47.876 --> 00:15:51.237]  And how spectacular will it be?
[00:15:51.237 --> 00:15:53.878]  Or will it be next year?
[00:15:53.878 --> 00:15:55.819]  We see elites hoarding gold.
[00:15:55.819 --> 00:15:57.820]  Notice gold's up today.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:04.242]  We see stock markets plunging until plunge protection teams at the Federal Reserve came in and propped up the market.
[00:16:07.145 --> 00:16:13.727]  They love with their insider knowledge at the big central banks and brokerage houses to ride these waves up and down.
[00:16:13.727 --> 00:16:23.709]  But still, they need to get us maneuvered into a point of a global meltdown to offer their solution planetary government.
[00:16:23.709 --> 00:16:27.590]  So we can truly be slaves to the private central banks.

[00:16:37.861 --> 00:16:51.325]  First time callers, and in the second hour, we'll have open phones for everybody, and in the third hour, Gerald Salente joins us, and we'll have open phones with him as well, because he predicted four years ago that we'd see the crash by two years ago.
[00:16:51.325 --> 00:16:54.206]  Well, there's been a crash in most areas of the world.
[00:16:54.206 --> 00:16:57.727]  They've just used unlimited fiat money to paper over it.
[00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:12.544]  But that is coming to an end, and I think the predictions of Gerald Cilente are coming true, and you now see the bond market the biggest bloated bubble in world history.
[00:17:12.544 --> 00:17:15.706]  So I want to hear from you on those fronts.
[00:17:15.706 --> 00:17:20.348]  Then, I want to explain something.
[00:17:20.348 --> 00:17:23.369]  I'm pro-human.
[00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:26.651]  I really don't care at the end of the day what color you are.
[00:17:27.856 --> 00:17:29.137]  Or where you came from.
[00:17:29.137 --> 00:17:51.085]  If you support private property and the right to self-defense, and you support a level playing field, and you're not a wannabe social engineer trying to guilt me into feeling like I'm a bad person, so I'll submit to whatever your agenda is, then I care about you and I want you to succeed.
[00:17:51.085 --> 00:17:55.587]  There's two issues that this Donald Trump situation gives us a window into.
[00:17:59.864 --> 00:18:03.147]  I don't trust Donald Trump as far as I can throw an elephant.
[00:18:03.147 --> 00:18:05.068]  Everybody knows that.
[00:18:05.068 --> 00:18:11.273]  That said, most of what he says makes a lot of sense and I think he's a really smart guy.
[00:18:11.273 --> 00:18:16.236]  The problem is he won't deliver on what he says he's going to do, in my experience.
[00:18:16.236 --> 00:18:19.479]  He is an establishment shell.
[00:18:19.479 --> 00:18:24.122]  That's just what my gut tells me and what I've seen and what a lot of insiders like Dr. Corsi and others say.
[00:18:24.122 --> 00:18:27.245]  In fact, let's get Dr. Corsi on.
[00:18:28.553 --> 00:18:31.696]  He's an expert on financial collapse, probably one of the best out there.
[00:18:31.696 --> 00:18:36.261]  We never get him on about that subject, but I want to get him on this week about it.
[00:18:36.261 --> 00:18:41.106]  And he actually talks to Trump and has a lot of inside baseball on it.
[00:18:41.106 --> 00:18:48.012]  That said, him coming out and saying criminals from all over the world come here.
[00:18:48.012 --> 00:18:52.076]  Not the good people in Mexico, but a lot of criminals run here.
[00:18:53.086 --> 00:18:54.787]  To escape justice.
[00:18:54.787 --> 00:18:57.009]  Well, just like criminals from the U.S.
[00:18:57.009 --> 00:19:00.692]  run to Mexico to escape justice, just not anywhere near the same numbers.
[00:19:00.692 --> 00:19:04.396]  Because Mexico doesn't have extradition.
[00:19:04.396 --> 00:19:09.980]  And then I saw Raw Story and CNN and just all these publications and outfits misrepresenting.
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:20.369]  I saw this Raw Story headline this morning that was, uh, Hispanic workers respond to Trump's claim that they're lazy.
[00:19:20.369 --> 00:19:21.310]  Trump never said that.
[00:19:22.381 --> 00:19:27.266]  Trump never said there weren't immigrants coming here that were hard-working.
[00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:32.071]  Trump talks all the time about immigrants from all over being harder-working than spoiled, rotten Americans in some cases.
[00:19:32.071 --> 00:19:35.115]  There are a lot of hard-working Americans, too.
[00:19:35.115 --> 00:19:40.440]  So see, they misrepresent what he said, which is a triumph of fraud over the people.
[00:19:41.297 --> 00:19:52.027]  I mean, I've got stacks of articles every day about illegals that have got 5 felonies, 7 felonies, 15 felonies, murdering, raping, and killing people and being released to kill again.
[00:19:52.027 --> 00:19:57.332]  I mean, it's not racist to tell the truth.
[00:19:59.247 --> 00:20:05.493]  It's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the industry leader, MyPatriotSupply.

[00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:00.699]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[00:21:00.699 --> 00:21:04.321]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[00:21:04.321 --> 00:21:05.682]  A pair of scissors.
[00:21:05.682 --> 00:21:11.485]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[00:21:11.485 --> 00:21:16.408]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big name companies, has a weakness.
[00:21:16.408 --> 00:21:17.169]  The phone line.
[00:21:17.449 --> 00:21:22.631]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[00:21:22.631 --> 00:21:26.533]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[00:21:26.533 --> 00:21:29.854]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[00:21:29.854 --> 00:21:32.315]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[00:21:32.315 --> 00:21:36.657]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[00:21:36.657 --> 00:21:37.537]  Scissors can't cut it.
[00:21:37.737 --> 00:21:40.199]  And that means your home stays safe.
[00:21:40.199 --> 00:21:44.002]  24-7 professional monitoring is under $15 a month with no contract.
[00:21:44.002 --> 00:21:47.504]  SimpliSafe home security keeps you safer than the other guys.

[00:21:48.665 --> 00:21:50.687]  Protect your home with the alarm you can trust.
[00:21:50.687 --> 00:21:51.507]  SimpliSafe.

[00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:57.232]  That's SimpliSafeDefense.com.
[00:21:58.496 --> 00:22:00.278]  Honey, it's time for dinner.
[00:22:00.278 --> 00:22:02.140]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.621]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[00:22:03.621 --> 00:22:05.163]  Mine is falling apart.
[00:22:05.163 --> 00:22:11.329]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[00:22:11.329 --> 00:22:14.552]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[00:22:14.552 --> 00:22:15.093]  What is that?
[00:22:15.393 --> 00:22:24.940]  Well, apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:33.646]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[00:22:33.646 --> 00:22:34.287]  Wow!
[00:22:34.287 --> 00:22:35.608]  That sounds scary.
[00:22:35.608 --> 00:22:40.051]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold shielded wallet.
[00:22:40.051 --> 00:22:40.872]  Are they more expensive?
[00:22:41.312 --> 00:22:41.812]  No.
[00:22:41.812 --> 00:22:49.495]  In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from IDStronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[00:22:49.495 --> 00:22:50.695]  Sounds great!
[00:22:50.695 --> 00:22:53.316]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[00:22:53.316 --> 00:22:57.378]  I want to be protected, and these wallets at IDStronghold.com look fantastic!
[00:22:57.958 --> 00:22:58.918]  Hey, Berkey Guy here.
[00:22:58.918 --> 00:23:00.759]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[00:23:00.759 --> 00:23:02.520]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.480]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?

[00:23:55.786 --> 00:23:56.667]  Come and take it!
[00:24:02.546 --> 00:24:05.327]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:24:05.327 --> 00:24:05.827]  to 2 p.m.
[00:24:05.827 --> 00:24:07.147]  Central, we're here live.
[00:24:07.147 --> 00:24:08.388]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:24:08.388 --> 00:24:25.733]  We're going to go to Tommy, Dave, Austin, Joe, Corey, and many others at the start of the next segment on the Greek situation and where you think this world financial crisis is going.
[00:24:25.733 --> 00:24:27.234]  We've been in a crisis for a long time.
[00:24:29.207 --> 00:24:51.241]  And the globalists have been making moves and preparations and noises, hoarding cash, hoarding gold, moving to armored redoubts, telling really wealthy people across North America and Israel to get out, escalating military confrontations with Russia and China.
[00:24:53.851 --> 00:24:56.793]  And let's be clear, Russia and China are not angels.
[00:24:56.793 --> 00:25:00.435]  But the globalists running Europe and the U.S.
[00:25:00.435 --> 00:25:07.780]  are the most competent evil people the world has ever seen.
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:12.002]  I mean, they are James Bond villains.
[00:25:12.002 --> 00:25:13.803]  And I got a news flash for you.
[00:25:13.803 --> 00:25:19.327]  James Bond books have always been and are still based on real scenarios.
[00:25:21.024 --> 00:25:25.046]  Ian Fleming, high-level OSS, high-level MI6.
[00:25:25.046 --> 00:25:31.469]  You can go read his magazine interviews, read the fiction books he wrote.
[00:25:31.469 --> 00:25:43.755]  You wonder why the new James Bond movies are about big megabanks that buy up a water reservoir in Latin America and turn it off to bankrupt the city and make everybody riot so they can buy the country up.
[00:25:43.755 --> 00:25:46.156]  That really came out in the IMF World Bank documents in 2002.
[00:25:47.597 --> 00:25:50.019]  Why do you think Latin America is so screwed up?
[00:25:50.019 --> 00:25:52.821]  Why do you think Eastern Europe and Africa is?
[00:25:52.821 --> 00:26:02.167]  Because speculators, globalists, never let things stabilize.
[00:26:02.167 --> 00:26:09.492]  And I hear these snide comments on talk radio and other places going, oh Greeks, Greece is just a third world country, they're lazy.
[00:26:09.492 --> 00:26:11.674]  No they're not!
[00:26:11.674 --> 00:26:15.977]  I've looked at the anthropology, I've interviewed the experts, the Greeks work really hard.
[00:26:19.076 --> 00:26:26.886]  And they've got a top-down economy where there's the rich and the poor, and they keep raising taxes on poor people, and folks are sick of it.
[00:26:26.886 --> 00:26:30.610]  And Greece has been signed on to a bunch of debts that aren't theirs.
[00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:32.913]  Just like Iceland did.
[00:26:32.913 --> 00:26:33.694]  And they said no.
[00:26:34.827 --> 00:26:39.929]  And it turned out 93% of the Icelandic debt was not the people's.
[00:26:39.929 --> 00:26:49.133]  Kurt Nemo wrote an excellent article showing different EU commissions and Greek commissions admitting that most of the debt is not theirs.
[00:26:49.133 --> 00:26:50.493]  The troika swindle.
[00:26:50.493 --> 00:26:53.654]  Greeks owe nothing.
[00:26:53.654 --> 00:26:59.057]  Meanwhile, there's another excellent article on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:26:59.057 --> 00:27:00.537]  Stats.
[00:27:00.537 --> 00:27:02.358]  Mainstream media devotees
[00:27:04.858 --> 00:27:16.111]  Five times... Now get this, mainstream media devotes five times more time to Confederate flag flap than to ISIS threat.
[00:27:16.111 --> 00:27:23.901]  And I want to be clear, ISIS is not your granddaddy's Al Qaeda that was pretty much totally staged in a very small group and synthetic.
[00:27:25.151 --> 00:27:44.606]  The West funded and allowed hardcore Islamic brigades out of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Afghanistan, and other areas to form and to recruit all over the world, from Europe to the United States, and have allowed them to set up networks, so they won't need to manufacture terror attacks next time.
[00:27:46.144 --> 00:27:48.565]  And I told you they're going to start hitting soft targets.
[00:27:48.565 --> 00:27:55.047]  Four years ago, I said, the so-called Free Syrian Army is Al-Qaeda, and they're going to start attacking.
[00:27:55.047 --> 00:27:57.007]  Now they changed their name to ISIS.
[00:27:57.007 --> 00:28:08.971]  And then Chris Christie, the anti-gun, open border, so-called Republican, another John Boehner, right out of the same port-a-potty, right out of the same latrine.
[00:28:08.971 --> 00:28:11.091]  Two similar droppings.
[00:28:11.091 --> 00:28:12.652]  Excuse me, I'm just so sick of these people.
[00:28:14.161 --> 00:28:17.323]  Has the nerve to say, when there's a terror attack, because they're getting ready for one.
[00:28:17.323 --> 00:28:22.367]  I don't know when, but they're going to let it happen.
[00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:24.429]  Don't blame the FBI director.
[00:28:24.429 --> 00:28:28.132]  Blame Rand Paul.
[00:28:28.132 --> 00:28:30.594]  Rand Paul didn't stop the NSA spying chump.
[00:28:30.594 --> 00:28:31.655]  It's still going on.
[00:28:31.655 --> 00:28:35.177]  And NSA spying didn't stop any of these other attacks.
[00:28:35.177 --> 00:28:41.863]  And when a mall, or another convention center, or another school, the targets we predicted they'll hit, and alright, it's what they hit,
[00:28:42.853 --> 00:28:46.615]  It's attacked, it's gonna be anti-gunners like you that are to blame!
[00:28:46.615 --> 00:28:48.916]  You disgusting piece of trash!
[00:28:48.916 --> 00:28:54.639]  So when we come back, I'm gonna play that clip.
[00:28:54.639 --> 00:29:02.163]  But the NSA's been spying on everything, and it's come out, it's not looking at ISIS.
[00:29:02.163 --> 00:29:06.085]  When the FBI agents try to stop Al-Qaeda or ISIS, they're blocked from doing it.
[00:29:07.165 --> 00:29:10.966]  I don't even blame the FBI agents themselves, but the politicians above them.
[00:29:10.966 --> 00:29:14.848]  9-11, the latest attacks, the attacks in Garland, they knew about it.
[00:29:14.848 --> 00:29:15.908]  They were told to stand down.
[00:29:15.908 --> 00:29:22.491]  So the local police got a tip from the FBI and were there and gunned them down.
[00:29:22.491 --> 00:29:26.673]  Because the politicians want to have the attacks so they can take more freedoms.
[00:29:26.673 --> 00:29:30.274]  They know we'll go, we'll make the borders wide open, why'd you let them in?
[00:29:30.274 --> 00:29:32.175]  The media will just ignore that, folks.
[00:29:33.632 --> 00:29:34.773]  That's what's happening.
[00:29:34.773 --> 00:29:39.976]  Meanwhile, while all this is going on, we are hearing all about the Rebel Battle Flag.
[00:29:39.976 --> 00:29:42.858]  Whoop-dee-doo!
[00:29:42.858 --> 00:29:46.361]  And boy, I tell ya, this is gonna tie into all of it.
[00:29:46.361 --> 00:29:48.442]  Knockout game is expanding.
[00:29:48.442 --> 00:29:49.843]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.843 --> 00:29:51.264]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.264 --> 00:29:52.365]  This is Divide and Conquer.
[00:29:52.365 --> 00:29:55.067]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.144 --> 00:30:04.027]  Have you ever come across someone on the internet that you suspected was a paid government troll?
[00:30:04.027 --> 00:30:07.208]  Well, there's a very good chance that you were not imagining things.
[00:30:07.208 --> 00:30:18.034]  Thanks to Edward Snowden, we now have solid proof that paid government trolls are using psychology-based influence techniques on social media websites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.
[00:30:18.374 --> 00:30:28.760]  Some of these techniques include uploading YouTube videos to discredit and promote distrust, fake online resources such as magazines and books to provide inaccurate information.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:33.222]  They also set up Facebook groups that encourage and monitor discussion on a topic.
[00:30:33.222 --> 00:30:46.390]  They can also set up fake trade sites that can take a person's money and personal information, as well as send those customers degraded or spoofed products, like sending computers overseas that are already equipped with a backdoor for the NSA.
[00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:51.074]  All of this is just more proof that it's actually the government engaging in cybercrime.
[00:30:51.074 --> 00:30:55.898]  Of course, it's all an effort to ramp up a non-existent threat to take our freedoms.
[00:30:55.898 --> 00:30:59.000]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com.

[00:33:40.979 --> 00:33:46.842]  Okay, we're gonna play a little game of Is That Racist?
[00:33:46.842 --> 00:33:51.445]  So you might be a little biased.
[00:33:51.445 --> 00:33:59.549]  Alright, so we are playing a game today asking people out here to flip through these photos and say if it's racist or not.
[00:33:59.549 --> 00:34:00.249]  Okay.
[00:34:00.249 --> 00:34:04.511]  Can you flip through the photos and just say yes or no it's racist?
[00:34:04.511 --> 00:34:05.332]  That's complicated.
[00:34:06.585 --> 00:34:07.665]  No.
[00:34:07.665 --> 00:34:08.206]  No.
[00:34:08.206 --> 00:34:09.286]  Is this racist to me?
[00:34:09.286 --> 00:34:10.166]  Let me know.
[00:34:10.166 --> 00:34:10.867]  Racist or not?
[00:34:10.867 --> 00:34:12.227]  No, ma'am.
[00:34:12.227 --> 00:34:12.887]  Of course, yes.
[00:34:12.887 --> 00:34:14.448]  The symbol is racist.
[00:34:14.448 --> 00:34:19.590]  So the General Lee from the Dukes of Hazzard, this car is racist?
[00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:20.830]  I would say, yeah.
[00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.111]  So are Daisy Dukes racist?
[00:34:23.111 --> 00:34:24.052]  No.
[00:34:24.052 --> 00:34:24.592]  Those are great.
[00:34:27.651 --> 00:34:28.332]  Yes or no?
[00:34:28.332 --> 00:34:31.434]  Definitely racist.
[00:34:31.434 --> 00:34:32.214]  That's just confusing.
[00:34:32.214 --> 00:34:35.136]  That's just kind of confusing, yeah.
[00:34:35.136 --> 00:34:38.618]  I like cats, but... No.
[00:34:38.618 --> 00:34:39.158]  No.
[00:34:39.158 --> 00:34:41.760]  Peanut butter jelly is delicious.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.901]  Now that is racist.
[00:34:42.901 --> 00:34:43.441]  No, just kidding.
[00:34:43.441 --> 00:34:44.162]  No.
[00:34:44.162 --> 00:34:44.282]  No.
[00:34:46.289 --> 00:34:47.410]  Heck no!
[00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:48.271]  I don't know!
[00:34:48.271 --> 00:34:56.898]  The city of Portland has decided that using peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as an example is a racial microaggression.
[00:34:56.898 --> 00:35:00.601]  Some cultures did not grow up eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
[00:35:00.601 --> 00:35:02.603]  So that makes them racist?
[00:35:02.603 --> 00:35:04.704]  Racial, it's microaggressive.
[00:35:04.704 --> 00:35:05.845]  Microaggressive, okay.
[00:35:05.845 --> 00:35:08.247]  There's different levels to racism.
[00:35:08.247 --> 00:35:09.969]  That's ridiculous because
[00:35:11.345 --> 00:35:15.768]  I mean, I really feel like people have redefined racism.
[00:35:15.768 --> 00:35:20.632]  You know, if I have control and power over you, that would be racist.
[00:35:20.632 --> 00:35:22.334]  Because of the color of your skin, that would be racist.
[00:35:22.334 --> 00:35:23.294]  But a sandwich?
[00:35:23.294 --> 00:35:26.136]  I mean, people don't even know what words mean anymore.
[00:35:26.136 --> 00:35:29.139]  And it's really irritating me, like hatred.
[00:35:29.139 --> 00:35:32.421]  Oh, you hate me because you don't agree, or you don't like the way I live.
[00:35:32.421 --> 00:35:34.003]  That's hatred, you know?
[00:35:34.003 --> 00:35:35.284]  So it's silly.
[00:35:35.284 --> 00:35:38.606]  I ain't gonna be no banker's slave.
[00:35:39.807 --> 00:35:43.192]  I ain't gonna be no banker's slave.
[00:35:43.192 --> 00:35:46.858]  Robbin' Peter to pay Paul from the cradle to the grave.
[00:35:46.858 --> 00:35:49.543]  I ain't gonna be no banker's slave.
[00:35:51.465 --> 00:35:52.646]  I'm pretty sure that's it.
[00:35:52.646 --> 00:35:55.667]  I'm pretty sure a lot of people in that picture are racists.
[00:35:55.667 --> 00:35:58.508]  Kanye West is just a very confused man.
[00:35:58.508 --> 00:35:59.709]  He's a racist!
[00:35:59.709 --> 00:36:01.370]  He doesn't know what's up or down.
[00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:04.231]  I'm guessing he's just Kid Rock.
[00:36:04.231 --> 00:36:05.772]  He's just, you know, a little white trash.
[00:36:05.772 --> 00:36:10.434]  Most of these people don't even know the meaning behind that Confederate flag.
[00:36:10.434 --> 00:36:13.056]  I mean, the flag represents, I agree, it represents slavery.
[00:36:13.056 --> 00:36:17.698]  I think it shouldn't really be a symbol in everyday life.
[00:36:18.863 --> 00:36:24.454]  I'm sorry, but the Stars and Bars was never flown as the national flag of the Confederacy.
[00:36:24.454 --> 00:36:27.280]  It was the flag of the Army of Northern Virginia.
[00:36:28.803 --> 00:36:32.686]  It was the battle flag, correct?
[00:36:32.686 --> 00:36:36.069]  It was the battle flag of the Confederate Army.
[00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:41.873]  Like I said before, most of the people who fought for that army never owned a slave.
[00:36:41.873 --> 00:36:45.476]  Granted, the aristocrats did, but like I said, it was on the way out.
[00:36:45.476 --> 00:36:47.478]  Slavery was an outdated institution.
[00:36:47.478 --> 00:36:48.579]  You know?
[00:36:48.579 --> 00:36:50.220]  You sound like a terrorist.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:51.141]  I just might be.
[00:36:54.283 --> 00:36:58.307]  Obviously him, Lil Jon, has the same idea of this is the South.
[00:36:58.307 --> 00:36:59.288]  That's what they were for.
[00:36:59.288 --> 00:37:01.910]  I understood that when I saw it.
[00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:04.513]  So.
[00:37:04.513 --> 00:37:05.874]  A paper bag.
[00:37:05.874 --> 00:37:07.496]  Brown bag.
[00:37:07.496 --> 00:37:09.037]  Brown paper bag.
[00:37:09.037 --> 00:37:09.958]  No.
[00:37:09.958 --> 00:37:11.499]  How could this be racist?
[00:37:11.499 --> 00:37:15.143]  Well, it's a racial slur, according to the city of Seattle.
[00:37:15.865 --> 00:37:16.246]  As in for?
[00:37:16.246 --> 00:37:18.168]  You're not allowed to brown bag your lunch.
[00:37:18.168 --> 00:37:19.930]  Brown bag your lunch.
[00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:21.853]  That is not racist.
[00:37:21.853 --> 00:37:23.215]  Have you ever heard that term?
[00:37:23.215 --> 00:37:24.116]  I did.
[00:37:24.116 --> 00:37:24.696]  I have.
[00:37:24.696 --> 00:37:25.397]  I have.
[00:37:25.397 --> 00:37:29.002]  If you're darker than the brown paper bag, then you're too dark.
[00:37:29.002 --> 00:37:30.824]  But white people didn't start that.
[00:37:30.824 --> 00:37:32.386]  That was something that black people did.
[00:37:33.027 --> 00:37:33.147]  Wow.
[00:37:33.147 --> 00:37:34.288]  You're educating me right now.
[00:37:34.288 --> 00:37:37.331]  If I saw you walking down the street, and you had it on, you're a Caucasian person,
[00:37:53.968 --> 00:37:57.329]  Either you're saying, unless you approach me, hey, how you doing?
[00:37:57.329 --> 00:37:58.270]  I'll shake your hand.
[00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:59.750]  I can care less.
[00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:00.770]  It doesn't matter now.
[00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:07.133]  If you're not trying to, you know, be around me, avoid me, or you cross the street and you have this on, then I know to stand clear of you.
[00:38:07.133 --> 00:38:07.793]  I see you.
[00:38:07.793 --> 00:38:08.573]  That's what you're wearing.
[00:38:08.573 --> 00:38:09.794]  That's what you represent.
[00:38:09.794 --> 00:38:10.514]  I understand it now.
[00:38:11.325 --> 00:38:14.247]  Do you think this is more like a divide and conquer sort of diversion thing?
[00:38:14.247 --> 00:38:16.809]  Do you think there are more important things people should be worried about?
[00:38:16.809 --> 00:38:17.989]  There are way more important things.
[00:38:17.989 --> 00:38:26.995]  You announce, and my best friend is gay, you announce the gay, uh, like it's legal everywhere on the same day that the guy was being buried.
[00:38:26.995 --> 00:38:28.276]  Uh, the preacher was being buried.
[00:38:28.276 --> 00:38:30.578]  So to me, I just think it's a way, yeah, it's a diversion.
[00:38:31.258 --> 00:38:37.740]  This flag been up for years, maybe just as long as the American flag has been waving or whatever.
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.621]  And nobody never brought this into context.
[00:38:39.621 --> 00:38:42.502]  KKK been around, things like that.
[00:38:42.502 --> 00:38:49.284]  And now you bring it up when you have the big issue is a young man, literally a racial act happened.
[00:38:49.284 --> 00:38:50.604]  He said it happened.
[00:38:50.604 --> 00:38:53.525]  He went in there with intention on killing people.
[00:38:53.525 --> 00:38:55.966]  But now you bring this just to get everybody conversating.
[00:38:55.966 --> 00:38:56.386]  That's all it is.
[00:38:56.906 --> 00:38:57.647]  This is our version.
[00:38:57.647 --> 00:38:59.228]  Americans don't want to be informed.
[00:38:59.228 --> 00:39:00.508]  They want to be entertained.
[00:39:00.508 --> 00:39:02.470]  So this is entertainment.
[00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:05.872]  I'd rather live poor and be free.
[00:39:05.872 --> 00:39:09.074]  I'd rather live poor and be free.
[00:39:09.074 --> 00:39:12.716]  Than live in some cage in the lap of luxury.
[00:39:12.716 --> 00:39:15.758]  I'd rather live poor and be free.
[00:39:15.758 --> 00:39:18.920]  I said I'd want to be a millionaire.
[00:39:30.145 --> 00:39:31.966]  So we have Ian right there.
[00:39:31.966 --> 00:39:44.471]  This is an emergency transmission from FEMA Region 6 in Occupy
[00:39:50.834 --> 00:39:52.516]  There is a war.
[00:39:52.516 --> 00:39:54.217]  It's happening now.
[00:39:54.217 --> 00:39:56.739]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:39:56.739 --> 00:39:59.342]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:39:59.342 --> 00:40:01.243]  We are the resistance.
[00:40:01.243 --> 00:40:02.965]  We are the Infowar.
[00:40:13.831 --> 00:40:37.180]  There were some good points made by Austinites on the streets about brown paper bags being distractions and rebel flags, but the whole race obsession itself is a distraction and has been engineered into a leftist-based race war that is becoming America's new culture.
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.861]  Every day we have new knockout game video.
[00:40:43.217 --> 00:40:45.659]  Of white people being attacked.
[00:40:45.659 --> 00:40:50.822]  And the folks that are doing it really think that the whites deserve it because they're bad people.
[00:40:50.822 --> 00:40:52.803]  They've oppressed.
[00:40:52.803 --> 00:40:56.986]  And this is how the media has dumbed it down.
[00:40:56.986 --> 00:41:05.712]  Whereas in the past, if the Klan went out and beat people or killed them, Christians and groups across the board would decry it.
[00:41:05.712 --> 00:41:09.034]  It would get criminally prosecuted, so it's stopped.
[00:41:09.034 --> 00:41:10.275]  For all intents and purposes.
[00:41:12.458 --> 00:41:35.619]  But now when a minority of black people go out, this has been going on for a decade and it's intensifying, and attack whites or attack the police, the media either covers it up or makes excuses for it and calls it a game.
[00:41:37.608 --> 00:41:45.451]  When the Klan goes out and beats somebody up or burns a cross in the yard or kills someone, that's not a game.
[00:41:45.451 --> 00:41:51.533]  When the Feds burned down Waco full of every race, color, and creed, that wasn't a game.
[00:41:51.533 --> 00:41:53.554]  World War II wasn't a game.
[00:41:53.554 --> 00:42:02.077]  So it shows how they semantically turn very serious things into a joke.
[00:42:02.077 --> 00:42:03.298]  And we have new clips today.
[00:42:06.323 --> 00:42:11.364]  of knockout game activity going on.
[00:42:11.364 --> 00:42:18.545]  Shock report, police attacked by mob in Cincinnati rescue white man from black beatdown.
[00:42:18.545 --> 00:42:21.466]  That was ongoing.
[00:42:21.466 --> 00:42:25.106]  And we see these videos every single day now.
[00:42:25.106 --> 00:42:34.388]  And the difference is when we see a video of white people doing this, it becomes an international sensation and whites are told that they are all collectively to blame.
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:43.184]  Or if a group of black guys beat up a gay person, then it's wrong.
[00:42:43.184 --> 00:42:52.612]  Or if a group of white guys beat up a gay person, or Hispanics beat up a homosexual, it's then called a hate crime.
[00:42:52.612 --> 00:43:00.358]  So, the literacy of our country for reading, writing, arithmetic, history, our basic common rights as humans, is null and void.
[00:43:04.144 --> 00:43:17.014]  But we are completely educated on how to obsess over race, and then selectively, if you're a quote, minority group, it's okay for you, if you're from Latin America, to come up and commit crimes.
[00:43:17.014 --> 00:43:27.242]  The San Francisco Sheriff's Department will release you saying that even if you're a multi-time felon, it violates your rights to hand you back over to ICE.
[00:43:27.242 --> 00:43:31.445]  So you can then go out and just shoot an innocent woman at the boardwalk because you feel like it.
[00:43:31.445 --> 00:43:33.087]  That story's on InfoWars.com.
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:45.288]  So there's this apologist idea where any crime coming out of anybody who isn't white is basically acceptable.
[00:43:45.288 --> 00:43:53.034]  You've got to ask yourself, what is that agenda really all about?
[00:43:53.034 --> 00:43:57.577]  Well, it's about race-based politics.
[00:43:57.577 --> 00:43:58.338]  And it's about
[00:44:00.123 --> 00:44:27.748]  creating an atmosphere where we all fight with each other and that's seen as reasonable and we go back to the same old story divide and conquer and I know I'm saying things that are known I'm gonna go to your phone calls right now it's just to see our country conquered going into world government and to see gun restrictions and
[00:44:29.122 --> 00:44:39.894]  Obamacare and open borders all pushed as litmus tests to prove we're not racist is a joke.
[00:44:39.894 --> 00:44:47.863]  And then even when all of this is unpopular and unconstitutional, still it's ramrodded through.
[00:44:56.175 --> 00:45:06.163]  And then finally, the Greeks, after three separate robberies by the EU, say, no, we're not going deeper into debt to pay what's impossible to pay.
[00:45:06.163 --> 00:45:08.725]  Most of this isn't even our debt.
[00:45:08.725 --> 00:45:10.086]  We're not going along with it.
[00:45:10.086 --> 00:45:21.896]  And the very central bankers that fund all this propaganda about being loving and being liberal are saying, cut off their food, cut off their medicine, cut off any money going into the country.
[00:45:25.427 --> 00:45:28.828]  Don't let tourists book hotel stays there.
[00:45:28.828 --> 00:45:30.189]  Hold them hostage.
[00:45:30.189 --> 00:45:35.810]  As the outgoing Greek finance minister called it, that's terrorism.
[00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:41.992]  So let's go to your phone calls and get your view on where you think all this is going.
[00:45:41.992 --> 00:45:51.075]  After I play the clip I mentioned earlier of Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, saying if there's a terror attack, Rand Paul is to blame.
[00:45:51.075 --> 00:45:53.056]  Don't blame the FBI director.
[00:45:54.924 --> 00:46:13.992]  I thought we'd blame the ISIS that attacks, who just executed a bunch of people, Islamic State suicide bombers strike Iraq in refinery town, execute more than 30 Syrian military members.
[00:46:13.992 --> 00:46:16.013]  I mean, I thought they were to blame.
[00:46:16.809 --> 00:46:24.012]  And I thought the government that allowed ISIS and Al Qaeda to form new organizations, I thought they were to blame.
[00:46:24.012 --> 00:46:31.535]  Oh, that's the bipartisan John McCain, John Boehner, and Barack Obama and NATO that did that.
[00:46:31.535 --> 00:46:36.238]  But see, the public is illiterate about all this.
[00:46:36.238 --> 00:46:39.259]  They only know about the General Lee and brown paper bags.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.681]  And I guess if I order fried chicken, I'm racist.
[00:46:44.681 --> 00:46:53.868]  I mean, just everything is like these phantoms of racism and phantoms of code words that don't even exist.
[00:46:53.868 --> 00:47:01.593]  Now they were reporting a 25 minute, now they're saying it's 30s plus in the ruins of a Syrian amphitheater.
[00:47:01.593 --> 00:47:04.915]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[00:47:04.915 --> 00:47:07.957]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tommy in Tennessee.
[00:47:07.957 --> 00:47:10.199]  Tommy, you're on the air.
[00:47:10.199 --> 00:47:11.560]  Hey Alex, I love you brother.
[00:47:13.257 --> 00:47:14.257]  You're on the air.
[00:47:14.257 --> 00:47:15.838]  Go ahead.
[00:47:15.838 --> 00:47:16.498]  I love you, brother.
[00:47:16.498 --> 00:47:17.118]  How's it going?
[00:47:17.118 --> 00:47:17.898]  It's going good.
[00:47:17.898 --> 00:47:19.358]  Go ahead.
[00:47:19.358 --> 00:47:20.238]  Yes, sir.
[00:47:20.238 --> 00:47:24.799]  My opinion on the Greek situation is basically it's the first domino to fall.
[00:47:24.799 --> 00:47:36.822]  I agree with what you're saying in terms of the economy, but I think what they're going to do is just stand back and let it collapse and watch how bad it gets and then try to use that as a model, you know, for what's to come in other areas.
[00:47:36.822 --> 00:47:37.542]  Absolutely.
[00:47:37.542 --> 00:47:38.722]  You hit the nail on the head, brother.
[00:47:40.031 --> 00:47:41.592]  So I agree with that.
[00:47:41.592 --> 00:47:48.579]  Just quickly, the second thing is 1963, Brandy's University, Bob Dylan in concert.
[00:47:48.579 --> 00:47:51.421]  The song is Masters of War.
[00:47:51.421 --> 00:47:53.683]  This song is your soul, my friend.
[00:47:53.683 --> 00:47:55.124]  I swear to God to it.
[00:47:55.124 --> 00:47:56.866]  It'll be your new theme song.
[00:47:56.866 --> 00:48:00.429]  You must have missed it, my friend, and I'm honored to have you call in.
[00:48:00.429 --> 00:48:04.412]  We do play Masters of War as bumper for about 13 years.
[00:48:04.412 --> 00:48:04.713]  My uncle
[00:48:06.516 --> 00:48:07.216]  Randy's University version.
[00:48:07.216 --> 00:48:10.818]  It's much more powerful and there's a gigantic applause at the end.
[00:48:25.802 --> 00:48:28.723]  But it is your soul, my friend, and I respect you.
[00:48:28.723 --> 00:48:32.084]  I would quit my job right now and come work for you if you needed me.
[00:48:32.084 --> 00:48:33.164]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[00:48:33.164 --> 00:48:42.247]  But it's just, again, that's why Rush Limbaugh says just ditto, because can you imagine taking calls over the years, just everybody thanking him?
[00:48:42.247 --> 00:48:48.949]  It's very humbling, and it just also gets like Chinese water torture, because I understand.
[00:48:48.949 --> 00:48:49.849]  Look, I love you, too.
[00:48:50.849 --> 00:48:51.930]  I appreciate you.
[00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:55.813]  I'm honored to talk to such a wonderful audience as you guys.
[00:48:55.813 --> 00:48:59.416]  And I'm trying to do the best job I can, so I just say thanks for putting up with me.
[00:48:59.416 --> 00:49:01.658]  Thank you, Tommy.
[00:49:01.658 --> 00:49:03.540]  Joe in Wisconsin, thanks for calling.
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.700]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:08.604]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[00:49:08.604 --> 00:49:09.805]  I just wanted to throw it out there.
[00:49:09.805 --> 00:49:10.505]  I don't know.
[00:49:10.505 --> 00:49:12.807]  It's just, you know, kind of a thought right now.
[00:49:12.807 --> 00:49:17.531]  I see us heading down that path of Greece a little bit more long term.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:23.148]  You know, because you see how everybody's getting behind Bernie?
[00:49:23.148 --> 00:49:27.776]  And if you look at Bernie's policies, they're all, you know, everything's pro-socialist.
[00:49:27.776 --> 00:49:29.319]  Yeah, Senator Bernie Sanders...
[00:49:31.175 --> 00:49:34.276]  Why don't you fill folks in for those that aren't aware of what you're talking about.
[00:49:34.276 --> 00:49:53.125]  You're saying that the globalists bring in their financial fascist model, but they want socialism at the national level, and they're going to let all the systems fail, then bring in total wealth redistribution and socialism to stagnate society and sell slavery as freedom, because the globalists are going to be offshore and exempt from it all.
[00:49:53.125 --> 00:49:57.327]  Yeah, it becomes that much easier.
[00:49:57.327 --> 00:49:59.388]  It makes it look like the people wanted it that way.
[00:50:00.253 --> 00:50:03.716]  You know, and then you have everybody on the internet, oh, this is a good thing.
[00:50:03.716 --> 00:50:04.216]  No, it's not.
[00:50:04.216 --> 00:50:07.699]  We just, we all just got to witness it's not a good thing.
[00:50:07.699 --> 00:50:17.447]  You know, we're living in an era that you can show them in their face, you can just hand them the evidence and it's like, oh, no big deal, you know?
[00:50:17.447 --> 00:50:21.710]  And you can see it, plain and simple, you know?
[00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:25.733]  So I don't see, I don't see us heading anywhere positive.
[00:50:27.086 --> 00:50:31.532]  It is just, we're all, you know, this is a sinking ship, you know, everybody knows it.
[00:50:32.558 --> 00:50:35.380]  Well, I'm not trying to be negative, but you're right.
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:38.382]  The current trajectory we're on, Joe, is a sinking ship.
[00:50:38.382 --> 00:50:39.002]  God bless you.
[00:50:39.002 --> 00:50:47.607]  But I think admitting the ship is sinking allows us to build lifeboats and to move them before the general public does and stampedes.
[00:50:47.607 --> 00:50:57.033]  But also, as Ron Paul and others have said, when things crash, there's a good chance to try to get folks to buy into freedom again.
[00:50:57.033 --> 00:50:57.974]  You know, legalize freedom.
[00:50:59.329 --> 00:51:05.574]  So Mark and his wife came over to see my wife and me, and he began talking about the 4th of July, Independence Day, you know?
[00:51:05.574 --> 00:51:10.077]  And he said, Guns80.com is having a really awesome special for the 4th of July.
[00:51:10.077 --> 00:51:12.699]  Celebrate your independence with the pistols now.
[00:51:12.699 --> 00:51:14.881]  The pistol kit's $4.99.
[00:51:14.881 --> 00:51:16.522]  That's right, $4.99.
[00:51:16.522 --> 00:51:20.445]  And the Hillary special is backed by popular demand, you remember?
[00:51:20.445 --> 00:51:23.427]  230 round mags, all that.
[00:51:23.427 --> 00:51:24.488]  Guns80.com.

[00:51:36.422 --> 00:51:40.644]  What if this also restores useless batteries and saves you lots of money?

[00:53:37.486 --> 00:53:44.452]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:53:44.452 --> 00:53:48.155]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:53:48.155 --> 00:53:49.096]  Call for your copy at 800-686-2237.
[00:53:49.096 --> 00:53:50.037]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:53:50.037 --> 00:53:50.297]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:53:50.297 --> 00:53:50.617]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:53:50.617 --> 00:53:51.758]  Come, your masters is war.
[00:54:06.383 --> 00:54:15.227]  Think how arrogant the neocons and democratic war hawks are.
[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:48.432]  They sit up there and they say when a terror attack comes it's Rand Paul's fault.
[00:54:48.432 --> 00:54:50.615]  Did we even ever play that clip?
[00:54:50.615 --> 00:54:53.398]  The Chris Kiske clip?
[00:54:53.398 --> 00:54:54.939]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:54:57.042 --> 00:54:59.323]  I keep talking about it.
[00:54:59.323 --> 00:55:01.143]  We'll play it in a moment.
[00:55:01.143 --> 00:55:18.709]  It's just at a certain point I'm speechless when the Republican and Democratic leadership with NATO have been openly arming Al-Qaeda, arming ISIS, turning them loose, destroying countries like Egypt and Libya.
[00:55:18.709 --> 00:55:26.191]  And when those states fail, they just come out
[00:55:30.171 --> 00:55:32.613]  And say, oh, we messed up, no big deal.
[00:55:32.613 --> 00:55:39.658]  And then no one points out they're the ones that helped reconstitute Al-Qaeda as ISIS, 50 times bigger than it ever was.
[00:55:39.658 --> 00:55:43.661]  14 years of the fake war on terror, the enemy's bigger and stronger than ever.
[00:55:43.661 --> 00:55:45.062]  Our government's funding it.
[00:55:45.062 --> 00:55:54.049]  That's so over-the-top sensational that I'm having a Robbie the Robot moment where he just can't compute it and smoke starts coming out of his ears.
[00:56:00.711 --> 00:56:11.761]  But this is because we have a public where 8 out of 10 people in California don't know what Independence Day is and 6 out of 10 in Austin, Texas on the street don't know either.
[00:56:11.761 --> 00:56:19.467]  These people are being preyed on by gangster thugs like Chris Christie.
[00:56:19.467 --> 00:56:28.175]  Imagine how bold they are to publicly arm terrorists and to turn them loose to take over countries that have done nothing to us
[00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:47.339]  And then to allow him to infiltrate the country, and the one senator that was opposing it and saying it was going to happen, the one guy that tried to protect us, the one guy that did the right thing, Ted Cruz did it too, but Rand was the strongest.
[00:56:47.339 --> 00:56:50.143]  So one of the two guys, and you blame him.
[00:56:52.188 --> 00:56:54.091]  I guess because they know an attack's coming.
[00:56:54.091 --> 00:56:55.673]  And remember what Rand Paul said in his speech.
[00:56:55.673 --> 00:57:02.723]  He said, there are those in this chamber that want there to be a terror attack so they can blame me.
[00:57:02.723 --> 00:57:04.045]  And now they're doing it!
[00:57:04.045 --> 00:57:08.131]  Ahead of time, they're going, when there's an attack, it's Rand Paul's fault!
[00:57:09.085 --> 00:57:11.687]  You know what Rand Paul's going to do when they do attack?
[00:57:11.687 --> 00:57:13.809]  He's going to point out we had open borders.
[00:57:13.809 --> 00:57:17.793]  He's going to point out our government helped fund Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[00:57:17.793 --> 00:57:24.319]  And he's going to play the clips of where he warned about it four years ago, three years ago, two years ago, a year ago, six months ago.
[00:57:24.319 --> 00:57:26.081]  So, he's walking right into your trap.
[00:57:26.081 --> 00:57:32.807]  We're going to go to break and come back with Dave and Austin and Corey and John and Daryl and others.
[00:57:32.807 --> 00:57:34.769]  Open phones throughout the entire next hour.
[00:57:39.428 --> 00:57:42.877]  But this can only be done because of mass ignorance.
[00:57:42.877 --> 00:57:48.251]  Very briefly, when I was reading this, I was just ashamed of my management.
[00:57:49.056 --> 00:57:51.898]  Because it's not a tactic.
[00:57:51.898 --> 00:58:04.164]  If I could keep the products that do sell, that are popular in stock, they're just such high quality, so organic, hard to source, that we're sold out of most products when they sell out for six weeks or longer.
[00:58:04.164 --> 00:58:05.965]  Rainforest sold out in only five days.
[00:58:05.965 --> 00:58:07.726]  Livershield sold out in one week.
[00:58:07.726 --> 00:58:09.707]  I miscalculated and ordered too little.
[00:58:09.707 --> 00:58:11.208]  Prostagard sold out.
[00:58:11.208 --> 00:58:12.348]  Childe sold out.
[00:58:12.348 --> 00:58:13.329]  Occupower sold out.
[00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:20.012]  Told Prostagard is in the truck on its way here, but the other stuff can be sold out for a long time.
[00:58:20.012 --> 00:58:22.712]  Survival Shield X2 will sell out.
[00:58:22.712 --> 00:58:24.633]  Super Metal Vitality will sell out.
[00:58:24.633 --> 00:58:35.117]  I don't know how we're going to fund ourselves because I just mismanage things and you don't even know how to calculate all this, but InfoWarsLife.com if you want to get these high quality nutraceuticals that are in high demand.
[00:58:35.117 --> 00:58:36.677]  InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:36.677 --> 00:58:37.277]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:37.277 --> 00:58:38.097]  Free shipping month of July.
[00:58:48.919 --> 00:59:05.369]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the Nightly News, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[00:59:05.369 --> 00:59:09.072]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[00:59:09.432 --> 00:59:13.477]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:59:13.477 --> 00:59:15.018]  Hdfirearms.com.
[00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:18.342]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[00:59:18.342 --> 00:59:23.468]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[00:59:23.468 --> 00:59:24.309]  It's always about security.
[00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.689]  I think so.
[00:59:51.478 --> 00:59:54.094]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.963 --> 01:00:09.829]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:11.391]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.391 --> 01:00:12.953]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.953 --> 01:00:17.137]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.137 --> 01:00:21.202]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.593 --> 01:00:34.535]  Alright, let's take a lot of your calls in this second hour.
[01:00:34.535 --> 01:00:38.959]  The Gerald Solente is joining us to talk about the Greek crisis.
[01:00:38.959 --> 01:00:42.741]  Greek banks prepare plan to raid deposits to avert collapse.
[01:00:42.741 --> 01:00:45.383]  And they're openly talking about doing the same model here.
[01:00:45.383 --> 01:00:47.685]  It's the very same banks doing this in Greece.
[01:00:47.685 --> 01:00:49.587]  They're planning to do this here.
[01:00:49.587 --> 01:00:53.690]  Sugar, flour, rice, panic Greek stock up on essentials.
[01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:54.951]  Could this be the end of the Euro?
[01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:58.934]  You know, globalism could fail.
[01:00:58.934 --> 01:00:59.294]  God
[01:01:01.843 --> 01:01:05.945]  Does predestine some things, but free will plays into that.
[01:01:05.945 --> 01:01:10.188]  We don't have to just give in to the cashless society, give in to world government.
[01:01:10.188 --> 01:01:20.154]  But watching these globalist banks, can you imagine what they're going to do when they have a global government with all cash banned, and everybody buying and selling biometrically?
[01:01:20.154 --> 01:01:26.237]  I mean, they're saying right now they're going to start just grabbing people's private after-tax money.
[01:01:26.237 --> 01:01:27.598]  Not the government, the banks!
[01:01:29.821 --> 01:01:32.603]  Because they hold the individual responsible.
[01:01:32.603 --> 01:01:36.787]  Our land is collateral on the national debt.
[01:01:36.787 --> 01:01:39.029]  We are pledged as collateral.
[01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:41.050]  Our children!
[01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:41.891]  Oh, but I forgot.
[01:01:41.891 --> 01:01:46.635]  Obama said, when you raise the debt limit, it doesn't raise the debt.
[01:01:46.635 --> 01:01:48.817]  So see, that's just me being racist.
[01:01:48.817 --> 01:01:51.059]  You know, I think I kind of got depressed this morning.
[01:01:52.318 --> 01:01:53.759]  I was up, I woke up at like 6 a.m.
[01:01:53.759 --> 01:01:59.302]  I was reading news articles and I was on Infowars and I go look at the comments for tips or anything.
[01:01:59.302 --> 01:02:01.984]  I just kind of scan some of the comments.
[01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:11.070]  I was on YouTube in a video about an illegal alien who had seven felonies and been deported five times and how they let him go
[01:02:12.495 --> 01:02:23.183]  San Francisco did, saying they think it's racist to turn a felon out of jail for all sorts of crimes over to the feds, who don't even deport them anyway, so it wouldn't matter.
[01:02:23.183 --> 01:02:26.586]  Obama's basically stopped deportations.
[01:02:26.586 --> 01:02:31.149]  I mean, a citizen isn't treated like that.
[01:02:31.149 --> 01:02:40.937]  And the guy went out and shot a lady, and I saw Democratic operatives, I went and clicked on their handles, they were real websites, with people with their dogs and their cats and everything, and, you know, trendies.
[01:02:42.205 --> 01:02:54.075]  And by their dogs and their cats, I mean they were real people, saying how dare me be racist and basically not just want to have people joyriding around shooting people.
[01:02:54.075 --> 01:02:58.059]  And then how dare I defend Donald Trump because I just stick with the white people.
[01:02:59.264 --> 01:03:02.165]  And it was mainly white people saying this.
[01:03:02.165 --> 01:03:04.526]  I mean, their whole ideology is just mental illness.
[01:03:04.526 --> 01:03:06.027]  It's like mentally ill.
[01:03:06.027 --> 01:03:12.169]  I mean, Mexico would deport you or imprison you if you'd been in jail and deported five times.
[01:03:12.169 --> 01:03:20.253]  I mean, this idea of if anybody's from somewhere else, we've got to let women come here from China.
[01:03:20.253 --> 01:03:23.514]  They're now the biggest one group, bigger than Mexicans.
[01:03:23.514 --> 01:03:26.795]  Used to be Mexico was the big immigrant group.
[01:03:26.795 --> 01:03:28.096]  It's now Chinese women.
[01:03:29.318 --> 01:03:37.605]  Thousands a week that we know of that come in to have their babies for free.
[01:03:37.605 --> 01:03:42.508]  They can stay, they're kids a citizen, free everything.
[01:03:42.508 --> 01:03:45.671]  And it's like, what do you got against Chinese women?
[01:03:45.671 --> 01:03:49.234]  Nothing, except I can't go to their country and get everything free.
[01:03:49.234 --> 01:03:50.375]  I mean, it's a joke!
[01:03:50.375 --> 01:03:53.297]  We're a joke!
[01:03:53.297 --> 01:03:54.398]  We're a joke!
[01:03:55.953 --> 01:03:58.234]  I mean, I can't even believe it anymore.
[01:03:58.234 --> 01:04:01.535]  I'm living in a... I mean, I really... It's almost like claustrophobia.
[01:04:01.535 --> 01:04:14.681]  I never used to have this feeling about politics, but now I just want to hide from everybody and just let everybody kill each other and just be idiots because... I mean, I'm not putting on an act here.
[01:04:14.681 --> 01:04:18.343]  I almost left earlier, okay?
[01:04:18.343 --> 01:04:20.824]  I couldn't even go on air earlier and they had to basically air a tape.
[01:04:22.512 --> 01:04:23.513]  I may just leave.
[01:04:23.513 --> 01:04:26.695]  I just... God, watching the videos, and I go out in the street.
[01:04:26.695 --> 01:04:28.216]  It's not Mark Dice doing this.
[01:04:28.216 --> 01:04:34.220]  The average Austinite folks cannot find their fat ass with both hands, and I want to slap them upside their head.
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:40.225]  But let me tell you, they are the most politically correct, full of it, arrogant scum!
[01:04:40.225 --> 01:04:42.586]  And I'm sick of them!
[01:04:42.586 --> 01:04:44.788]  And let me tell you who they mainly are.
[01:04:44.788 --> 01:04:47.490]  They're a bunch of pasty, stupid white people.
[01:04:48.647 --> 01:04:55.217]  As dumb as the so-called minorities are, on average they're more awake when I talk to them than these dumb-ass white people everywhere.
[01:04:55.217 --> 01:04:57.480]  I mean, this country's a sick joke!
[01:04:59.019 --> 01:05:04.321]  Do you want to know why the Greeks voted no in an overwhelming majority to get out of the European Union?
[01:05:04.321 --> 01:05:06.362]  Well, it goes back to the Troika swindle.
[01:05:06.362 --> 01:05:16.787]  As Kurt Nimmo writes, in June, the Truth Committee on Public Debt, established by the Speaker of the Greek Parliament, came to the conclusion that Greece should not pay this debt because it is illegal, illegitimate, and odious.
[01:05:16.787 --> 01:05:23.671]  The establishment media has hidden from view the facts behind the debt and has sided with the banks in declaring the population of Greece deserves austerity.
[01:05:23.671 --> 01:05:28.913]  And it's attended poverty and misery because of the Greek government's refusal to accept the harsh conditions of the Troika.
[01:05:28.933 --> 01:05:29.393]  I think so.
[01:05:58.905 --> 01:06:18.658]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[01:06:18.658 --> 01:06:19.078]  Well then,
[01:06:19.418 --> 01:06:23.300]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.000]  Hdfirearms.com.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.321]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[01:06:28.321 --> 01:06:33.443]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.

[01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:10.834]  And that's what you'll find at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:11.354 --> 01:07:28.201]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality, or because they're not 100% organic, or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:28.201 --> 01:07:34.644]  Whether it's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine, or DNA Force, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality,
[01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:38.586]  Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shield, Oxy Powder.
[01:07:38.586 --> 01:07:49.410]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.

[01:08:04.625 --> 01:08:10.669]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:08:10.669 --> 01:08:15.432]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:08:15.432 --> 01:08:32.703]  You know, I feel a lot better now because I've been holding my anger in the last few weeks and during the break I had a controlled rage just walking around back in the storage area of the facility.
[01:08:34.108 --> 01:08:36.009]  And I feel better.
[01:08:36.009 --> 01:08:51.315]  I was not going to be able to continue doing the radio show because my revulsion of the globalists and how sickening they are and how evil they are and how bad they are just gets to me.
[01:08:51.315 --> 01:08:54.916]  And then I just wonder, what is wrong with other people?
[01:08:54.916 --> 01:09:00.258]  Why do we put up with this inversion of reality and common sense being trampled?
[01:09:03.359 --> 01:09:10.505]  The vast majority of Greeks debt of the Greeks people's debt is not their debt.
[01:09:10.505 --> 01:09:14.709]  Kurt Nemo has an article breaking it down from mainline commissions.
[01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:17.651]  Ireland's debt is not Ireland's debt.
[01:09:17.651 --> 01:09:19.933]  Iceland's debt is not Iceland's debt.
[01:09:19.933 --> 01:09:22.535]  The UK's debt is not UK's debt.
[01:09:22.535 --> 01:09:26.099]  Germany's debt is not Germany's debt.
[01:09:26.099 --> 01:09:29.341]  Our real debt in the United States is currently almost 19 trillion.
[01:09:31.411 --> 01:09:36.675]  We've signed on to over $100 trillion in unfunded mandates.
[01:09:36.675 --> 01:09:43.881]  We owe $100 trillion roughly.
[01:09:43.881 --> 01:09:46.343]  And that is horrible.
[01:09:46.343 --> 01:09:54.370]  We have signed on to $2.2 quadrillion globally.
[01:09:54.370 --> 01:09:55.551]  That is not our debt.
[01:09:59.329 --> 01:10:03.789]  That debt is 20 plus times bigger.
[01:10:06.274 --> 01:10:07.955]  Then what we really owe.
[01:10:07.955 --> 01:10:19.541]  And to watch these big mega banks maneuver the planet, every country the same thing, into socialism, into investing your pension funds in their Ponzi schemes, into domestication.
[01:10:19.541 --> 01:10:21.322]  Who promotes open borders?
[01:10:21.322 --> 01:10:22.402]  The big six banks.
[01:10:22.402 --> 01:10:23.643]  Who promotes taking our guns?
[01:10:23.643 --> 01:10:24.623]  The big six banks.
[01:10:24.623 --> 01:10:26.064]  Who promotes breaking up the family?
[01:10:26.064 --> 01:10:27.505]  The big six banks.
[01:10:27.505 --> 01:10:35.749]  Who sponsors in Mexico forced Gardasil shots on all 12-year-old girls three years running?
[01:10:37.932 --> 01:10:38.657]  Look it up!
[01:10:38.657 --> 01:10:39.603]  The Filthy Banks.
[01:10:41.152 --> 01:10:42.453]  Because they're not banks.
[01:10:42.453 --> 01:10:44.573]  They're organized crime syndicates.
[01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:47.755]  They are the ones lobbying for forced inoculations.
[01:10:47.755 --> 01:10:50.376]  They are the ones lobbying for war with Russia.
[01:10:50.376 --> 01:10:53.297]  They are the ones lobbying for NSA spying.
[01:10:53.297 --> 01:10:57.539]  They are the ones openly involved working with ISIS and funding them.
[01:10:57.539 --> 01:11:09.224]  The big banks are on record, caught shipping in narcotics, laundering the money, owning and leasing the aircraft, not just for the drugs and the money,
[01:11:10.916 --> 01:11:19.542]  But they're even into white slavery, the sex trade, shipping sex slaves around.
[01:11:19.542 --> 01:11:22.284]  But don't worry.
[01:11:22.284 --> 01:11:28.988]  If they catch your neighbor with a hooker, they're going to take his car and put him in jail.
[01:11:28.988 --> 01:11:31.910]  Because that didn't hurt anybody, and that was consensual.
[01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:34.572]  So we're going to throw the book at you and have a big prosecution.
[01:11:36.604 --> 01:11:44.258]  And if you're an illegal alien that's raped and robbed and arsoned, we're gonna let you out and not deport you!
[01:11:44.258 --> 01:11:45.741]  Because it's all part of the globalism!
[01:11:48.260 --> 01:12:00.150]  If you're a serial killer, like a railway killer, we're gonna deport you four or five times, and put you in jail more than 15 times, and just let you use aliases and kill whoever you want, because you're a horrible murdering criminal.
[01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:15.923]  But if you're a 12-year-old Mexican girl, we're gonna give you a shot of something known to attack your ovaries, and sterilize you in many cases, or at least destroy your fertility long-term, and cause you all sorts of ovarian and uterine problems.
[01:12:20.908 --> 01:12:28.094]  So, we're gonna soft kill all the little girls, because that's not racist, because it is.
[01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:30.136]  They're being targeted.
[01:12:30.136 --> 01:12:33.298]  See, just massive genetic firing squad.
[01:12:33.298 --> 01:12:36.741]  But don't worry, you won't hear a word out of Mecha and LaRosa about that.
[01:12:36.741 --> 01:12:47.129]  But you will if you try to deport a guy that had been in jail over and over again, seven felonies,
[01:12:48.109 --> 01:12:50.551]  Convictions and deported five times.
[01:12:50.551 --> 01:12:53.833]  I covered it all yesterday, all the details.
[01:12:53.833 --> 01:12:59.297]  It's a war on reality.
[01:12:59.297 --> 01:13:04.500]  Oh, DynCorp can load up a plane load of little kids.
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:05.921]  Whistleblowers can go public.
[01:13:05.921 --> 01:13:15.047]  It can turn out they shipped tens of thousands of child sex slaves, and I'm talking five years old.
[01:13:15.047 --> 01:13:15.948]  Points all over the world.
[01:13:17.423 --> 01:13:32.007]  It comes out in the Chicago Tribune, it comes out in Congress, and bipartisanly they line up and put money in to go after the Congresswoman who exposed it.
[01:13:32.007 --> 01:13:34.287]  That's who runs the government.
[01:13:34.287 --> 01:13:41.429]  We have a government that oversees at UN bases in the Balkans.
[01:13:45.046 --> 01:13:50.691]  Loading CERB and other children up.
[01:13:50.691 --> 01:13:55.955]  Oh, there's no made-for-TV movies about that.
[01:13:55.955 --> 01:13:56.395]  The U.N.
[01:13:56.395 --> 01:14:01.560]  whistleblowers that talk about it, they end up losing their job, getting indicted, getting killed.
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:07.184]  And don't worry, the Texas Attorney General has been put before a grand jury.
[01:14:07.184 --> 01:14:08.846]  They're trying to indict him right now.
[01:14:10.953 --> 01:14:20.940]  For not filing a $1,000 fee, listing himself as a stockbroker.
[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:26.004]  How many of you in the real world forget to file something or forget to fill out a license?
[01:14:26.004 --> 01:14:29.206]  I mean, anybody in business knows it's constantly changing.
[01:14:29.206 --> 01:14:33.769]  And let me tell you something, there's no way to trade in securities and not break the law.
[01:14:33.769 --> 01:14:37.232]  The laws are written in this sewage of a country.
[01:14:47.708 --> 01:15:05.321]  This, this, this cess tank of a nation to now go after the Attorney General of the state of Texas to the Democratic Party controlled Office of Public Integrity in Austin, Texas, the same group that went after Tom DeLay and everybody else.
[01:15:05.321 --> 01:15:08.543]  And I'm not defending Tom DeLay, but he was innocent.
[01:15:10.086 --> 01:15:12.127]  I don't think he was politically a good guy.
[01:15:12.127 --> 01:15:23.654]  This Attorney General was suing, getting our power plants turned back on, was suing, trying to stop Obamacare, and was the one recommending to the Governor to ship our gold back.
[01:15:23.654 --> 01:15:27.096]  I remember seeing when they were going to ship our gold back out of New York two weeks ago.
[01:15:27.096 --> 01:15:30.878]  I said, man, get ready for the globalists to come after Texas, and they are.
[01:15:30.878 --> 01:15:33.039]  I think they'll probably indict the Governor next.
[01:15:33.039 --> 01:15:34.600]  They're probably just going to indict everybody.
[01:15:36.664 --> 01:15:37.865]  Because, see, that's how they do it.
[01:15:37.865 --> 01:15:40.247]  They don't march in here with federal troops anymore.
[01:15:40.247 --> 01:15:45.291]  They just indict you while they're busy running C-130s with little kids on them.
[01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:48.734]  Little kids go out, cocaine comes back in.
[01:15:48.734 --> 01:15:54.478]  But you get a Christian attorney general and a Christian governor who actually know what's going on.
[01:15:54.478 --> 01:15:58.522]  Can you imagine how much the globalists hate them?
[01:15:58.522 --> 01:16:00.223]  And you heard it here first.
[01:16:00.223 --> 01:16:04.026]  I bet you they indict Abbott soon for something.
[01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:04.967]  They'll find something.
[01:16:06.786 --> 01:16:10.987]  And then they're going to try to indict everybody!
[01:16:10.987 --> 01:16:14.387]  Unless you join with the dark side.
[01:16:14.387 --> 01:16:17.508]  I'm not joining with jack crap.
[01:16:17.508 --> 01:16:20.709]  You know, I think that's why I'm being so negative and so mean today, and I apologize.
[01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:25.189]  I just... I feel like stomping somebody in the ground right now.
[01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:33.431]  I don't feel like sitting up here talking about this, because I'm fed up with criminals running wild.
[01:16:33.431 --> 01:16:34.071]  I'm fed up
[01:16:34.991 --> 01:16:40.293]  We're going six miles over the speed limit.
[01:16:40.293 --> 01:16:49.397]  And the state police pulled me over two weeks ago and kept me on the side of the road for like 30 minutes.
[01:16:49.397 --> 01:16:59.141]  While he sat there and ran through my record, which there is none, and came back with big saucer eyes, because I know he was going through his intelligence database.
[01:17:00.049 --> 01:17:01.910]  He thought it was so interesting who he pulled over.
[01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:05.731]  It's just like, my time means nothing, I am nothing.
[01:17:05.731 --> 01:17:11.272]  I'm a citizen, which means I'm the lowest form of crap.
[01:17:11.272 --> 01:17:16.634]  But if I was a seven-time felony legal alien, I'd just be released.
[01:17:16.634 --> 01:17:24.036]  And I said I'd go to your phone calls, and I haven't done it yet, and I apologize for that.
[01:17:24.036 --> 01:17:26.737]  But maybe I shouldn't be on air today, because I'm about to get really nasty.
[01:17:30.486 --> 01:17:31.206]  You know what it is?
[01:17:31.206 --> 01:17:34.148]  I really love this country.
[01:17:34.148 --> 01:17:47.255]  And to see it turned into a big, stinking joke... ...is painful.
[01:17:47.255 --> 01:17:56.661]  And then I sit here and I imagine, what are all these soft, stupid people going to do when the real hell comes?
[01:17:57.728 --> 01:18:03.592]  Because there's never been a softer, more dumbed-down world in many areas.
[01:18:03.592 --> 01:18:09.676]  And let me tell you, we're like lambs to the slaughter, a buffet to wolves, and it's gonna get crazy.
[01:18:09.676 --> 01:18:23.625]  I look at the 20th century and what happened then, and it makes me just absolutely cringe.
[01:18:23.625 --> 01:18:24.666]  You know, it comes down to this.
[01:18:30.086 --> 01:18:32.907]  It's just all so real.
[01:18:32.907 --> 01:18:34.928]  I mean, the hellish stuff I know.
[01:18:34.928 --> 01:18:51.174]  Like, I get up here on air and I say the Chicago Tribune reported on thousands and thousands of children over a five-year period flown out by Western contractors with the UN, children to be used in sex slavery, sex industry, and snuff films.
[01:18:52.290 --> 01:18:56.533]  And then that sounds completely insane and made up, even though it's true.
[01:18:56.533 --> 01:19:00.496]  And then almost no one even knows about it, but they know about the rebel flag.
[01:19:00.496 --> 01:19:05.540]  I mean, it just, it's an example of what brainwashing can do.
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:07.741]  I'm going to skip this network break.
[01:19:07.741 --> 01:19:10.243]  So we have time to go to the calls here and I'm going to go to the calls right now.
[01:19:10.243 --> 01:19:11.704]  And just, just listen, don't thank me.
[01:19:11.704 --> 01:19:13.426]  Please don't do it.
[01:19:13.426 --> 01:19:14.727]  And I'm just going to go to the next person.
[01:19:15.765 --> 01:19:18.427]  I want to hear what you have to say about Greece, about the state of the world.
[01:19:18.427 --> 01:19:20.088]  When do you think the collapse is coming?
[01:19:20.088 --> 01:19:21.629]  Can it be averted?
[01:19:21.629 --> 01:19:23.231]  What do you think it's going to look like?
[01:19:23.231 --> 01:19:24.151]  I want to take your calls.
[01:19:24.151 --> 01:19:30.156]  I really appreciate Dave and Corey and everybody else holding.
[01:19:30.156 --> 01:19:32.177]  Dave in California, you're on the air.
[01:19:32.177 --> 01:19:32.577]  Go ahead.
[01:19:32.577 --> 01:19:34.099]  All right, Alex.
[01:19:34.099 --> 01:19:35.199]  Yeah, I'm feeling your pain.
[01:19:35.199 --> 01:19:37.561]  You know, it's the post Fourth of July depression.
[01:19:37.561 --> 01:19:39.222]  We want to be in a great country.
[01:19:39.222 --> 01:19:40.763]  We want to do great things.
[01:19:40.763 --> 01:19:44.126]  They're holding us back and it's pissing us off and I'm hearing it.
[01:19:44.691 --> 01:19:48.313]  And, you know, I'd much rather have you angry than depressed.
[01:19:48.313 --> 01:19:48.913]  No, I hear you.
[01:19:48.913 --> 01:19:52.515]  I mean, I rarely get depressed, but I mean, I'm just genuinely, it's sinking in.
[01:19:52.515 --> 01:20:01.880]  I mean, I got three children, and it's really sinking in that we're in the hands of very wicked people.
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:04.562]  It's just at a fundamental level, I'm freaked out.
[01:20:04.562 --> 01:20:06.222]  That's all.
[01:20:06.222 --> 01:20:09.104]  These masters of war, they are the masters of debt.
[01:20:09.807 --> 01:20:11.829]  These are the same guys, and that's their plan.
[01:20:11.829 --> 01:20:15.051]  Put us into debt, and then get us into the big war.
[01:20:15.051 --> 01:20:16.052]  And we're all feeling it.
[01:20:16.052 --> 01:20:18.174]  Everybody's getting a little freaked out now.
[01:20:18.174 --> 01:20:19.755]  Even if they don't listen to your show.
[01:20:19.755 --> 01:20:21.657]  And if they listen to your show, they're getting even more freaked out.
[01:20:21.657 --> 01:20:24.659]  By the way, I've talked about that in the last, you know, three months.
[01:20:24.659 --> 01:20:26.961]  Everybody I know says something big's coming.
[01:20:26.961 --> 01:20:30.384]  George Norrie talks to everybody he knows, and I talk to congressmen off-air.
[01:20:30.384 --> 01:20:32.065]  They say it's the same thing.
[01:20:32.065 --> 01:20:34.427]  You say folks that don't even listen are freaked out.
[01:20:34.427 --> 01:20:35.548]  What are people freaked out about?
[01:20:36.513 --> 01:20:37.674]  Well, it's a conglomeration.
[01:20:37.674 --> 01:20:40.496]  I called originally because of what you said about the bubbles.
[01:20:40.496 --> 01:20:42.197]  And, you know, I love Peter Schiff.
[01:20:42.197 --> 01:20:43.698]  He's the bubble master.
[01:20:43.698 --> 01:20:48.642]  The guy talks more about bubbles than anybody, and I'm really excited to see that you're bringing Peter into your show.
[01:20:48.642 --> 01:20:50.803]  I think that's a great addition.
[01:20:50.803 --> 01:20:54.266]  And I gotta say, I love the way you bring these authorities in there.
[01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:57.348]  Paul Craig Roberts, Gerald Solanti, Peter Schiff.
[01:20:57.348 --> 01:21:00.570]  You got the... Who's the guy with the debt bubble?
[01:21:00.570 --> 01:21:01.171]  What's his name?
[01:21:01.171 --> 01:21:02.552]  Who worked for the CIA?
[01:21:02.552 --> 01:21:04.473]  You know, with the currency wars?
[01:21:04.473 --> 01:21:05.033]  James Rickards.
[01:21:06.974 --> 01:21:08.975]  You know, you've got these authorities that come in.
[01:21:08.975 --> 01:21:11.837]  It's like a university you're holding over there.
[01:21:11.837 --> 01:21:13.358]  So, uh, don't give up the fight.
[01:21:13.358 --> 01:21:15.599]  Now, I called in because of the bubbles.
[01:21:15.599 --> 01:21:19.501]  And, you know, I listen to Peter Schiff a lot, and he talks about the bubbles.
[01:21:19.501 --> 01:21:26.466]  But nobody's really talking about the conglomeration of all the different bubbles that are blown up financially in the world today.
[01:21:26.466 --> 01:21:31.529]  And this Greece thing is just the beginning of what's going to be revealed here shortly.
[01:21:31.529 --> 01:21:35.531]  What's happening is, we've isolated seven major bubbles in the world today.
[01:21:36.317 --> 01:21:39.639]  Most people don't talk about it, but do you want to hear about them?
[01:21:39.639 --> 01:21:40.860]  Go ahead.
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:43.481]  Okay, well, the personal debt bubble, we're all feeling that.
[01:21:43.481 --> 01:21:45.422]  Everybody's all stressed out over money.
[01:21:45.422 --> 01:21:47.383]  No wonder people aren't smiling on the streets.
[01:21:47.383 --> 01:21:48.784]  They're deeply in debt.
[01:21:48.784 --> 01:21:51.045]  But again, that's all part of the plan.
[01:21:51.045 --> 01:21:52.646]  And we know about the bond bubble.
[01:21:52.646 --> 01:21:55.368]  The bond thing is what most of the experts are focusing on.
[01:21:55.368 --> 01:21:59.690]  Look, the government has borrowed, what is it, $18.7 trillion right now?
[01:21:59.690 --> 01:22:03.832]  And all the governments around the world have the same kind of bond bubble.
[01:22:03.832 --> 01:22:05.073]  So the bond bubble's going to pop.
[01:22:05.896 --> 01:22:08.059]  I just saw a thing on BBC today.
[01:22:08.059 --> 01:22:11.744]  The US government just printed more cash than it ever has printed before.
[01:22:11.744 --> 01:22:13.847]  So I'd say we're definitely in a cash bubble.
[01:22:13.847 --> 01:22:18.955]  They've created more cash, whether it's euros or dollars or drachmas, I don't care what they are.
[01:22:18.955 --> 01:22:21.919]  We're in a situation with more cash in the world than ever.
[01:22:22.651 --> 01:22:28.392]  Real estate, well, it's in another bubble again, and that's the original thing that Peter Schiff was warning everybody about, the real estate bubble.
[01:22:28.392 --> 01:22:30.052]  Well, it's at new high levels now.
[01:22:30.052 --> 01:22:32.373]  It's even higher than it was in 2008.
[01:22:32.373 --> 01:22:35.233]  It's something like 45% bigger than it was then.
[01:22:35.233 --> 01:22:37.694]  It's just totally insane.
[01:22:37.694 --> 01:22:39.674]  You know, and that affects everybody right where they live.
[01:22:39.674 --> 01:22:41.054]  That's most people's equity.
[01:22:41.054 --> 01:22:45.655]  If they are in debt, they've got at least a little bit of equity in their home, and they've seen that equity come back again.
[01:22:45.655 --> 01:22:48.095]  But, hey, that's just another bubble, too.
[01:22:48.095 --> 01:22:50.496]  And, of course, you've got the stock market bubble, they call it the equity bubble.
[01:22:50.496 --> 01:22:51.856]  You've got the education bubble!
[01:22:53.377 --> 01:22:55.098]  Okay, well there's eight.
[01:22:55.098 --> 01:22:56.198]  You've got the future obligations.
[01:22:56.198 --> 01:22:58.039]  Healthcare cost bubble.
[01:22:58.039 --> 01:22:58.780]  Obamacare.
[01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:02.181]  I would say future obligations is to healthcare.
[01:23:02.181 --> 01:23:02.461]  Yeah.
[01:23:02.461 --> 01:23:06.143]  So, you know, right now you've been reporting, you know, you talk about it a lot.
[01:23:06.143 --> 01:23:09.125]  Illinois, what are they, $180 billion in debt?
[01:23:09.125 --> 01:23:13.387]  California, no, what is it, $108 in Illinois, $180 in California.
[01:23:13.387 --> 01:23:17.749]  That's current debt, by the way, not what is future commitments.
[01:23:20.851 --> 01:23:24.232]  Yeah, and then the last one is the derivative bubble.
[01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:36.395]  Now you've got all this stuff on paper written off of stuff like, you know, you're into the precious metals and you look at what's going on with the manipulation of the silver prices through the naked shorts on the ComEx market.
[01:23:36.395 --> 01:23:39.276]  Now you've got a huge bubble going on with the derivatives.
[01:23:39.276 --> 01:23:45.878]  I mean, this is, you know, we just picked out eight different bubbles all about to pop.
[01:23:47.122 --> 01:23:49.103]  And that's just gonna set him up for the big war.
[01:23:49.103 --> 01:23:51.864]  So, you know, what you're doing is a good thing, warning people.
[01:23:51.864 --> 01:23:55.345]  If you're not angry or even a little depressed, you're not paying attention.
[01:23:55.345 --> 01:23:56.186]  God bless you, brother.
[01:23:56.186 --> 01:23:57.546]  And again, thanks for putting up with me.
[01:23:57.546 --> 01:23:59.027]  Sorry, I was getting angry earlier.
[01:23:59.027 --> 01:24:07.110]  I just legitimately... Here's an allegory.
[01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:08.090]  We're a ship.
[01:24:08.090 --> 01:24:10.571]  The captain says he's taking the ship on this course.
[01:24:10.571 --> 01:24:11.552]  You can look at the...
[01:24:12.617 --> 01:24:20.644]  chart, the map, and you can see that in a thousand miles we're going to run into a major continent.
[01:24:20.644 --> 01:24:23.807]  And the captain's arguing, saying, no, that's more ocean out beyond there.
[01:24:23.807 --> 01:24:25.128]  It's totally safe.
[01:24:25.128 --> 01:24:26.469]  You're like, no, it's well known.
[01:24:26.469 --> 01:24:28.111]  You're going down the road of tyranny.
[01:24:28.111 --> 01:24:29.412]  It's well known this is going to happen.
[01:24:29.412 --> 01:24:33.095]  Well, I've been on the air since we were a thousand miles out.
[01:24:33.095 --> 01:24:36.098]  Now we're two miles out.
[01:24:36.098 --> 01:24:37.839]  You can see the mountains.
[01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:39.441]  You can see coral reefs coming into view.
[01:24:42.085 --> 01:24:48.613]  And I'm up on the deck of the ship and you are and all of us going, hey, to the other folks, we're headed towards land.
[01:24:48.613 --> 01:24:51.035]  We're about to run into it.
[01:24:51.035 --> 01:24:52.137]  It's going to be devastating.
[01:24:53.319 --> 01:24:55.941]  And they look at you and they go, what's land?
[01:24:55.941 --> 01:24:56.682]  What's ship?
[01:24:56.682 --> 01:24:57.263]  What's water?
[01:24:57.263 --> 01:24:59.985]  And you're like, look, we're on a ship, water.
[01:24:59.985 --> 01:25:01.206]  We're coming towards the reef.
[01:25:01.206 --> 01:25:03.188]  And they just go, ehhh.
[01:25:03.188 --> 01:25:13.377]  And you're just like, I mean, our government created Al Qaeda, created ISIS, is funding them, killed everybody at Benghazi to give them weapons.
[01:25:13.377 --> 01:25:15.459]  I told you they're going to start attacking.
[01:25:15.459 --> 01:25:17.381]  Rand Paul exposes it.
[01:25:17.381 --> 01:25:19.663]  So the media says he's behind the next attack.
[01:25:23.749 --> 01:25:30.656]  That's inverted reality!
[01:25:30.656 --> 01:25:38.765]  That's crazy!
[01:25:38.765 --> 01:25:44.191]  It is the dishonorableness of people like John Boehner and Chris Christie and Barack Obama
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:48.502]  I was watching Obama's video address where he didn't thank God.
[01:25:48.502 --> 01:25:52.285]  He's always said, God bless the end, which is kind of a folksy phrase.
[01:25:52.285 --> 01:25:55.187]  Now he says, you know, have a great weekend or have a nice day.
[01:25:55.187 --> 01:25:57.129]  You know, the trendy thing.
[01:25:57.129 --> 01:26:02.313]  And in his Fourth of July address, he didn't say it, but I looked at how charismatic he was, how fake he was.
[01:26:02.313 --> 01:26:04.715]  What a good liar he is.
[01:26:04.715 --> 01:26:09.719]  I mean, he can project that he really cares about you and he's legitimate and he's for real.
[01:26:10.919 --> 01:26:13.940]  He makes Bill Clinton look like a sorry liar.
[01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:16.020]  But then I know what he's done.
[01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:20.101]  He knows the policies they put in place, double black unemployment.
[01:26:20.101 --> 01:26:23.662]  He knows they're building more federally funded prisons in black areas.
[01:26:23.662 --> 01:26:26.162]  He knows Planned Parenthood's targeting blacks.
[01:26:26.162 --> 01:26:34.184]  He knows in his first year in office he got funding doubled for basically forced abortions in Africa.
[01:26:34.184 --> 01:26:37.084]  He knows vaccines are deadly.
[01:26:37.084 --> 01:26:39.285]  He knows non-organic's really bad.
[01:26:41.974 --> 01:26:48.758]  He's just so evil!
[01:26:48.758 --> 01:26:55.361]  And they could have had the first black president and used it to bring people together, as poll numbers show, when he was first elected.
[01:26:55.361 --> 01:26:58.002]  But as soon as he got in, you saw the design.
[01:26:58.002 --> 01:27:07.888]  It was another cold-blooded globalist move to create absolute racial strife.
[01:27:07.888 --> 01:27:10.129]  I mean, I can't even watch MSNBC anymore.
[01:27:11.479 --> 01:27:16.703]  They are so premeditatedly abusive and evil.
[01:27:16.703 --> 01:27:21.187]  They're so horrible.
[01:27:21.187 --> 01:27:27.892]  They know what they're doing.
[01:27:27.892 --> 01:27:30.994]  And can you imagine what they're going to do during a meltdown in this country?
[01:27:30.994 --> 01:27:36.879]  They're going to take bank accounts, pension funds, stock market stuff, and if you get upset and go out,
[01:27:38.294 --> 01:27:41.136]  And try to, you know, get justice back at your state level.
[01:27:41.136 --> 01:27:49.363]  They're just going to have federal troops invade the state, blow up stuff and say, you did it, or I did it, and that we're, you know, rebel flag wavers or something.
[01:27:49.363 --> 01:27:53.627]  I mean, you can see what they've geared up and gotten ready, and it's horrible.
[01:27:53.627 --> 01:27:54.968]  And this is why I'm so upset.
[01:27:54.968 --> 01:28:04.296]  In my gut, the feeling I have is those times that I got mugged a couple times, or the big bully cornered me and I was going to have to fight him.
[01:28:05.543 --> 01:28:14.366]  That it's not fear, it's the sickening feeling that I'm gonna have to fight.
[01:28:14.366 --> 01:28:22.089]  But it's sitting here, in my whole life the experience of having to fight physically was right then and I could just do it and get it over with.
[01:28:22.089 --> 01:28:31.992]  Now I gotta sit here in slow motion watching the asleep public drool collectively while I watch the criminals come in and steal everything nailed down
[01:28:33.743 --> 01:28:35.324]  And just level this country.
[01:28:35.324 --> 01:28:39.885]  I'm going to go to break and come back and then I'm going to race through your calls.
[01:28:39.885 --> 01:28:40.405]  I promise.
[01:28:40.405 --> 01:28:44.946]  Corey and Daryl and John and Jeff and Joe.
[01:28:44.946 --> 01:28:45.587]  Great call.
[01:28:45.587 --> 01:28:47.767]  Last caller was an excellent call.
[01:28:47.767 --> 01:28:50.588]  And we'll get your take on this whole situation.
[01:28:50.588 --> 01:28:53.269]  But I physically have empathy for the Greeks.
[01:28:55.782 --> 01:28:58.144]  Reduced to $22 a day they can get out of the bank.
[01:28:58.144 --> 01:28:59.384]  That's not the government doing that.
[01:28:59.384 --> 01:29:03.327]  That's the real government, the global government, the cashless society grid.
[01:29:03.327 --> 01:29:10.231]  That's JPMorgan Goldman Sachs.
[01:29:10.231 --> 01:29:14.975]  And to see food shipments being stopped into the country, they're talking about stopping medicine coming in.
[01:29:14.975 --> 01:29:24.361]  Even if you're a company owner and have the money and paid your taxes and you want to contract outside to bring food in, the EU has a grid around the country and isn't letting them leave.
[01:29:25.757 --> 01:29:29.360]  I mean, this is hardcore!
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:36.285]  And you watch CNN or something, they're reporting on it like it's no big deal.
[01:29:36.285 --> 01:29:39.247]  Because I know this is going to be visited upon us.
[01:29:39.247 --> 01:29:42.530]  It's why they don't want you being self-sufficient.
[01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:45.732]  It's why they demonize preppers.
[01:29:45.732 --> 01:29:47.033]  I don't want to say it, but I got to.
[01:29:47.033 --> 01:29:48.374]  We told you so.
[01:29:48.374 --> 01:29:49.775]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.775 --> 01:29:52.297]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.297 --> 01:29:54.999]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.082 --> 01:30:04.565]  Presidential candidate Chris Christie wants Americans to blame Rand Paul for terror attacks that haven't even happened yet.
[01:30:04.565 --> 01:30:06.867]  Here is what he told Morning Joe viewers.
[01:30:06.867 --> 01:30:12.310]  What Rand Paul has done to make the country weaker and more vulnerable is a terrible thing.
[01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:23.316]  As the only guy who used the Patriot Act in this race as a former prosecutor, we're going to look back on this and he should be in front of hearings and in front of Congress if there's another attack.
[01:30:23.316 --> 01:30:26.298]  Not the director of the FBI or the director of the CIA.
[01:30:26.758 --> 01:30:27.859]  That's right, Governor Christie.
[01:30:27.859 --> 01:30:33.662]  We shouldn't look at the FBI, even though almost every terror attack on this country has happened with the help of an FBI informant.
[01:30:33.662 --> 01:30:39.845]  But what about the statements made by Agent Thomas Fuentes, who said we have to keep the fear alive in order to justify budget increases?
[01:30:39.845 --> 01:30:50.991]  And then back in 2009, former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge claimed that he was pressured by members of George Bush's cabinet to raise the national terror alert level just before the 2004 presidential election.
[01:30:50.991 --> 01:30:52.912]  No, we shouldn't look at those guys.
[01:30:52.912 --> 01:30:53.652]  That's right, Christie.
[01:30:53.652 --> 01:30:55.113]  You really have your priorities straight.
[01:30:55.293 --> 01:30:59.014]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:30:59.014 --> 01:31:04.155]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.

[01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:38.882]  For the last two years I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:31:39.122 --> 01:31:42.944]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[01:32:55.901 --> 01:33:07.248]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:08.869]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.706 --> 01:33:37.588]  You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too!
[01:33:37.588 --> 01:33:40.190]  You'll fire a musket, but I'll run you through!
[01:33:40.190 --> 01:33:42.652]  While you're waiting for the next attack!
[01:33:50.018 --> 01:33:51.979]  But on this battlefield, no one wins.
[01:34:08.095 --> 01:34:15.502]  Again, I read this story when it went up about 30 minutes ago by Paul Joseph Watson, and it made me disgusted.
[01:34:15.502 --> 01:34:21.507]  And it reminded me of what I'd already read about the Trilateral Commission plan.
[01:34:21.507 --> 01:34:32.797]  And you wonder why they're flooding Europe, Western and Eastern, with illegal aliens from Africa and from the Middle East at record levels.
[01:34:34.025 --> 01:34:47.776]  The plan is to make them a new voting bloc that will trump any individual EU country ever getting out, and then have them basically call for merging with Africa and the Middle East.
[01:34:47.776 --> 01:34:50.118]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[01:34:50.118 --> 01:34:58.344]  And so now the EU security head has called political Islam the future of Europe.
[01:34:58.344 --> 01:35:00.226]  Sharia law for the West.
[01:35:02.958 --> 01:35:20.647]  As the threat from ISIS extremists grows, the European Union's head of foreign affairs and security policy, Federica Mogherini, I believe you pronounced it right, has caused consternation by asserting that political Islam is a firm part of Europe's future.
[01:35:23.168 --> 01:35:33.070]  Responding to last month's brutal Islamist terror attack in Tunisia, Kuwait and France, she dismissed the idea of a class of civilizations and shot back at critics of mass immigration.
[01:35:33.070 --> 01:35:34.770]  Islam belongs in Europe.
[01:35:34.770 --> 01:35:36.550]  It holds a place in Europe's history.
[01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:42.352]  I guess invading a few times and taking over areas, I guess that's true, and killing Christians en masse.
[01:35:42.352 --> 01:35:46.172]  I mean, I'm not attacking Islam per se, but I mean, give me a break.
[01:35:46.172 --> 01:35:49.993]  I mean, Europe can't even be for Europeans now, I guess, or Christians.
[01:35:52.125 --> 01:35:55.827]  Because there's this socialist and globalist hatred of Christians, folks, period.
[01:35:55.827 --> 01:35:57.268]  Islam belongs in Europe.
[01:35:57.268 --> 01:35:59.310]  It holds a place in Europe's history.
[01:35:59.310 --> 01:36:04.433]  In our culture, in our food, and what matters most in Europe's present and future.
[01:36:04.433 --> 01:36:08.936]  Before adding, I'm not afraid to say that political Islam should be part of the picture.
[01:36:08.936 --> 01:36:10.777]  Religion plays a role in politics.
[01:36:10.777 --> 01:36:12.518]  Yeah, ban all Christian stuff.
[01:36:14.133 --> 01:36:16.900]  Again, get rid of Christian culture, bring in another.
[01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:18.445]  Not always good, not always bad.
[01:36:18.445 --> 01:36:20.109]  Religion can be part of the process.
[01:36:20.109 --> 01:36:22.936]  What makes the difference is whether the process is democratic or not.
[01:36:24.502 --> 01:36:24.862]  Really?
[01:36:24.862 --> 01:36:30.485]  Well, what if 51% of Muslims vote to put bags over women's heads or sexually mutilate them?
[01:36:30.485 --> 01:36:34.108]  Does my daughter have to go get her genitals cut off?
[01:36:34.108 --> 01:36:36.569]  Or wear a bag over her head?
[01:36:36.569 --> 01:36:38.810]  You're gonna have to come through my guns first!
[01:36:38.810 --> 01:36:40.571]  I'm sick of being overwrote!
[01:36:40.571 --> 01:36:48.616]  I'm sick of being told to stand down by all you fascist bootlickers allied with any criminal organization you can, telling me you're the liberal.
[01:36:48.616 --> 01:36:50.137]  You're a bunch of scum!
[01:36:51.223 --> 01:36:59.727]  But you are mentally ill Jacobins from the French Revolution who wanted to invert reality, have 10-day work weeks, abolish the family.
[01:36:59.727 --> 01:37:06.390]  You're a bunch of crazy people!
[01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:09.551]  I'm gonna do the Chris Christie piece on your calls, I promise.
[01:37:09.551 --> 01:37:10.852]  Let's play Chris Christie.
[01:37:10.852 --> 01:37:12.993]  Go ahead and roll this disgusting maggot.
[01:37:14.005 --> 01:37:29.193]  When our government is rogue, our government's funding the terrorists, our government is clearly out of control and illegitimate, and then now Rand Paul trying to stop it, trying to stop funding Al-Qaeda and ISIS, and exposing Benghazi, he's now the enemy, and when there's a terror attack, it's his fault.
[01:37:29.193 --> 01:37:31.815]  That's how stupid he thinks you are!
[01:37:31.815 --> 01:37:33.095]  And you know what I'm afraid?
[01:37:33.095 --> 01:37:34.956]  Not this audience, but the general public?
[01:37:34.956 --> 01:37:40.719]  I think he knows what he's talking about.
[01:37:40.719 --> 01:37:41.460]  What a slug!
[01:37:42.861 --> 01:37:46.282]  He thinks he'll get brownie points doing stuff like this.
[01:37:46.282 --> 01:37:47.942]  Let's go ahead and go to the clip.
[01:37:47.942 --> 01:37:51.543]  Yeah, and in town hall meetings, people are really worried about ISIS.
[01:37:51.543 --> 01:37:53.623]  They're really worried about the threat of terrorism.
[01:37:53.623 --> 01:37:58.064]  And that's why what Rand Paul has done to make this country weaker and more vulnerable is a terrible thing.
[01:37:58.064 --> 01:38:01.205]  And for him to raise money off of it is disgraceful.
[01:38:01.205 --> 01:38:01.985]  It's disgraceful.
[01:38:01.985 --> 01:38:06.226]  And as the only guy who's used the Patriot Act in this race as a former prosecutor,
[01:38:07.126 --> 01:38:10.568]  You know, what he's done is, we're going to look back on this.
[01:38:10.568 --> 01:38:11.568]  Listen this morning.
[01:38:11.568 --> 01:38:16.531]  We're going to look back on this and he should be in front of hearings in front of Congress if there's another attack.
[01:38:16.531 --> 01:38:19.492]  Not the director of the FBI or the director of the CIA.
[01:38:19.492 --> 01:38:22.934]  So, it's not Rand Paul trying to stop ISIS.
[01:38:22.934 --> 01:38:26.096]  No, no, he's behind it now here in Upside Down World.
[01:38:26.096 --> 01:38:35.081]  Now, let's reverse Upside Down World and come back to the real world with a one minute vignette that we air on local radio stations across the country that Rob Dude put together.
[01:38:35.081 --> 01:38:35.461]  Here it is.
[01:38:36.219 --> 01:38:37.091]  Yeah, in town.
[01:38:38.812 --> 01:38:44.275]  Presidential candidate Chris Christie wants Americans to blame Rand Paul for terror attacks that haven't even happened yet.
[01:38:44.275 --> 01:38:46.577]  Here is what he told Morning Joe viewers.
[01:38:46.577 --> 01:38:52.020]  What Rand Paul has done to make the country weaker and more vulnerable is a terrible thing.
[01:38:52.020 --> 01:39:03.026]  As the only guy who used the Patriot Act in this race as a former prosecutor, we're going to look back on this and he should be in front of hearings and in front of Congress if there's another attack.
[01:39:03.026 --> 01:39:06.008]  Not the director of the FBI or the director of the CIA.
[01:39:06.488 --> 01:39:07.569]  That's right, Governor Christie.
[01:39:07.569 --> 01:39:13.412]  We shouldn't look at the FBI, even though almost every terror attack on this country has happened with the help of an FBI informant.
[01:39:13.412 --> 01:39:19.555]  Or what about the statements made by Agent Thomas Fuentes, who said we have to keep the fear alive in order to justify budget increases.
[01:39:19.555 --> 01:39:30.701]  And then back in 2009, former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge claimed that he was pressured by members of George Bush's cabinet to raise the national terror alert level just before the 2004 presidential election.
[01:39:30.701 --> 01:39:32.622]  No, we shouldn't look at those guys.
[01:39:32.622 --> 01:39:33.362]  That's right, Christie.
[01:39:33.362 --> 01:39:34.823]  You really have your priorities straight.
[01:39:35.003 --> 01:39:38.766]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:39:38.766 --> 01:39:48.754]  By the way, Drudge had a Hill article out yesterday that the majority of the money being given by Republicans and Democratic leadership is to try to knock Rand Paul out of the race.
[01:39:48.754 --> 01:39:54.038]  They're not worried about Trump, not worried about Bush, they're worried about Paul.
[01:39:54.038 --> 01:39:58.101]  Because they know he's for real, folks.
[01:39:58.101 --> 01:39:59.382]  They know Governor Abbott's for real.
[01:40:00.287 --> 01:40:01.968]  They know the Attorney General down here is for real?
[01:40:01.968 --> 01:40:03.589]  They just indicted the Texas Attorney General?
[01:40:03.589 --> 01:40:09.092]  Or the indictment is pending in the grand jury?
[01:40:09.092 --> 01:40:18.738]  For securities fraud, he faces life in prison over not filing a thousand dollar filing fee he forgot to do?
[01:40:18.738 --> 01:40:24.302]  Maybe I heard he even had a crooked fingernail once.
[01:40:24.302 --> 01:40:26.063]  Okay, we're going to your phone calls.
[01:40:26.063 --> 01:40:27.304]  Let's talk to Cory in Washington.
[01:40:27.304 --> 01:40:28.524]  Thanks for holding, you're a trooper?
[01:40:28.524 --> 01:40:29.125]  Welcome, sir!
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:32.001]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me.
[01:40:32.001 --> 01:40:33.082]  Thank you.
[01:40:33.082 --> 01:40:45.212]  About four months ago, you had a guy on named Richie Allen out of the UK, and you were discussing how people are waking up, but there's no one really to lead or guide them.
[01:40:45.212 --> 01:40:55.041]  And I had a recommendation, piggybacking on Dave, your last caller, of more excellent guests in the Paul Craig Roberts, Joel Skousen mold.
[01:40:55.041 --> 01:40:56.081]  And there's four of them.
[01:40:56.081 --> 01:40:57.843]  I think you've had Dr. Alan Keyes on before.
[01:40:57.843 --> 01:40:58.944]  It's always good to hear from him.
[01:40:59.616 --> 01:41:02.398]  If you could get him back on again, that would be awesome.
[01:41:02.398 --> 01:41:04.640]  I don't know if you're aware of Chris Ann Hall.
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:16.490]  She's a constitutional attorney setting brushfires of liberty all over the land, trying to restore the public, get patriots to tear down the walls of indoctrination.
[01:41:16.490 --> 01:41:19.753]  If you could get her on, she is fantastic.
[01:41:19.753 --> 01:41:25.918]  And then two that would be relevant to this week that are always harping on the fake money and the fake currencies.
[01:41:26.781 --> 01:41:30.183]  Um, would be Ann Barnhart and Ernest Huber.
[01:41:30.183 --> 01:41:47.112]  Um, Ann is a, she's out of Denver, Colorado, and she was, uh, she went, she shut her brokerage house down after the MS Global thing because she knew at that point when the Honorable John Corzine stole all those people's money that, um,
[01:41:48.075 --> 01:41:48.956]  She could no longer do it.
[01:41:48.956 --> 01:41:49.656]  She knew it was a rig.
[01:41:49.656 --> 01:41:50.877]  She knew it was a game.
[01:41:50.877 --> 01:41:52.559]  And she got out.
[01:41:52.559 --> 01:41:55.221]  She basically, uh... We'll take those into consideration.
[01:41:55.221 --> 01:41:55.621]  Thank you.
[01:41:55.621 --> 01:41:57.863]  I'm aware of some of those folks and their work.
[01:41:57.863 --> 01:42:00.525]  Specifically, though, what do you think about the Greek economy?
[01:42:00.525 --> 01:42:05.288]  Is this the beginning of the big one, or what do you think is about to happen?
[01:42:05.288 --> 01:42:06.269]  You know, who knows?
[01:42:06.269 --> 01:42:08.491]  You know, all smoke and mirrors.
[01:42:08.491 --> 01:42:09.291]  It's all a game.
[01:42:09.291 --> 01:42:11.553]  It's all to get everybody excited.
[01:42:11.553 --> 01:42:15.276]  You never know, you know, what kind of shadow puppets they're putting up.
[01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:21.472]  But yeah, who knows?
[01:42:21.472 --> 01:42:25.254]  It's fun to think about and go into scenarios, but it's just like what it is.
[01:42:25.254 --> 01:42:31.697]  I mean, people, obviously people are waking up because, you know, maybe five years ago they said, oh, okay, they would have, you know, just voted.
[01:42:32.301 --> 01:42:33.122]  They wouldn't have voted no.
[01:42:33.122 --> 01:42:35.423]  They just would have said, okay, just do what you've been doing.
[01:42:35.423 --> 01:42:41.828]  Well, the Greeks have already had to have massive tax increases to pay off a lot of debt that's not theirs.
[01:42:41.828 --> 01:42:43.069]  Some of the debt is theirs.
[01:42:43.069 --> 01:42:48.152]  And so they know that if they raise taxes again, it'll only stall their economy more.
[01:42:48.152 --> 01:42:52.915]  But now the globalists are going to cut off their food, their medicine, you name it.
[01:42:52.915 --> 01:42:56.138]  And I just wonder if the world's going to stand by and let the private banks
[01:42:57.233 --> 01:43:04.143]  This world government that's growing engage in human rights violations against Greece.
[01:43:04.143 --> 01:43:09.890]  Well that's up to, you know, we the people and other people's countries if they're going to sit around and be slaves and they can get up and fight.
[01:43:09.890 --> 01:43:12.053]  Well I think folks should book trips to Greece.
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:14.501]  To support them.
[01:43:14.501 --> 01:43:22.204]  And I'm strongly considering going to Spain, Italy and Greece, the main epicenters of what we're about to see unfold.
[01:43:22.204 --> 01:43:28.147]  And I believe there's a very good chance it's going to be this winter or early next year.
[01:43:28.147 --> 01:43:29.368]  It may even be this fall.
[01:43:29.368 --> 01:43:33.790]  But I think we're going to see a new global spectacular meltdown.
[01:43:33.790 --> 01:43:41.634]  And out of that, a call for a global body headed up by the IMF, World Bank and International Bank of Settlements.
[01:43:42.844 --> 01:43:45.306]  To stabilize global currencies.
[01:43:45.306 --> 01:43:54.752]  And now, whether a country likes it or not, they've got to go under the control of this institution to fix a global crisis with a global body.
[01:43:54.752 --> 01:43:56.273]  And now there's an article that U.S.
[01:43:56.273 --> 01:44:02.017]  preparing coup to prevent Greece from falling under Russian influence.
[01:44:02.017 --> 01:44:04.879]  Oh yes, the Russians are to blame for everything.
[01:44:04.879 --> 01:44:08.622]  No, the megabanks are the ones that have conquered this country.
[01:44:08.622 --> 01:44:09.683]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:44:11.169 --> 01:44:21.820]  The United States and Germany are preparing to engineer a coup in Greece to keep the country operating as a strategic asset of NATO's vulnerable southeast European flank.
[01:44:22.825 --> 01:44:32.592]  A putsch in Athens to save the allied Greece from the enemy Russia is in preparation by the US and Germany with backing from non-taxpayers of Greece.
[01:44:32.592 --> 01:44:43.040]  The Greek oligarchs, Anglo-Greek ship owners, and the Greek church, writes John Helmer, the longest continually serving foreign correspondent in Russia, not connected to the corporate media.
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:53.509]  The primary tip-off, something is brewing, can be detected by the presence of Victoria Newland, Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs in Athens in March.
[01:44:53.509 --> 01:44:57.312]  Newland and The Guardian reported on March 17th, flew into the capital amid mounting U.S.
[01:44:57.312 --> 01:45:02.357]  concerns that the great Euro debt crisis had begun to pose a geopolitical threat.
[01:45:02.357 --> 01:45:07.001]  Allowed to veer out of control, Greece could end up in the habit of Russia.
[01:45:08.288 --> 01:45:13.433]  Financially bereft and without EU links to keep it bound to the West.
[01:45:13.433 --> 01:45:21.980]  NATO's southeastern flank would be immeasurably weakened at a time of mounting global security woes over Islamic fundamentalists in the Middle East.
[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:23.842]  The Guardian reports.
[01:45:23.842 --> 01:45:33.230]  Oh, the radical army, the jihadis, there'll be a new invasion of Europe by the Muslims if we don't give in to global government.
[01:45:35.367 --> 01:45:59.522]  It's the globalists running the clash of civilizations, bringing in, not the scientists, not the technicians, not the patriots of the Middle East, there are a lot of good folks over there, but the scum of the earth, who then promptly sign up for welfare and put on gangster outfits and merge jihadi culture with gangster gangbanger hip-hop culture.
[01:45:59.522 --> 01:46:00.923]  A horrid mutation.
[01:46:06.010 --> 01:46:11.516]  In the midst of Europe bitching and complaining that their welfare checks aren't big enough.
[01:46:11.516 --> 01:46:18.443]  I mean, what a disaster!
[01:46:18.443 --> 01:46:27.292]  But the socialists controlled by the globalists instinctively hate wealth, hate independence, so they want to wreck it and pull it all down so they can squat on top of it.
[01:46:28.530 --> 01:46:36.972]  And then have armored security all around them to protect them from the public when they themselves are the ones that destabilized the entire world.
[01:46:36.972 --> 01:46:40.894]  Daryl in California, thanks for holding.
[01:46:40.894 --> 01:46:41.534]  You there, Alex?
[01:46:41.534 --> 01:46:42.414]  Yes, I am, brother.
[01:46:42.414 --> 01:46:43.294]  Good to hear from you.
[01:46:43.294 --> 01:46:46.995]  Oh, it's so good to hear from you.
[01:46:46.995 --> 01:46:55.978]  My wife and I were in Germany just a few weeks ago during Bilderberg, and we traveled through northern Germany, or just the lower two-thirds of Germany.
[01:46:56.779 --> 01:46:59.442]  And from Frankfurt down.
[01:46:59.442 --> 01:47:03.705]  And the news there, you know, their news bubble is a little different from ours.
[01:47:03.705 --> 01:47:07.709]  They have their own propaganda that they push on their people.
[01:47:07.709 --> 01:47:21.962]  But in traveling through there and then visiting with her family and, you know, turning them on to the Second Amendment, which they were afraid of until I left, and discussing with them about the gold
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:22.900]  That's right.
[01:47:53.326 --> 01:47:58.749]  And, uh, and, uh, going to these different things and visiting these people.
[01:47:58.749 --> 01:48:07.733]  The barns on those farms there are, are, you know, they have a 16,000 square foot footprint and they're three stories tall.
[01:48:07.733 --> 01:48:11.215]  And, uh, the countryside, you fly over the country, it's totally green.
[01:48:11.215 --> 01:48:12.376]  It's all farms.
[01:48:12.376 --> 01:48:13.916]  And they even farm their trees.
[01:48:13.916 --> 01:48:20.900]  They have sections that are forests that they cut down and replant and, uh, they farm trees and they do something else.
[01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:22.481]  Now they're photon farmers.
[01:48:22.481 --> 01:48:22.861]  I call them.
[01:48:23.573 --> 01:48:28.298]  Yeah, all of those giant barns have thousands of solar panels on them.
[01:48:28.298 --> 01:48:38.688]  If something breaks down in Europe, if it comes apart in Europe, and these people don't like the Euro, these communities will fall together in small little cells.
[01:48:38.688 --> 01:48:44.774]  I'm glad you mention that because Europe is much more self-sufficient, Greece and other areas, but Germany as well.
[01:48:45.934 --> 01:48:47.595]  Than the United States.
[01:48:47.595 --> 01:48:49.596]  We used to be very self-sufficient.
[01:48:49.596 --> 01:48:52.717]  They never basically gave up their agrarian lifestyle.
[01:48:52.717 --> 01:48:55.799]  Even though they live in the city, a lot of folks go out and have a farm in the country.
[01:48:55.799 --> 01:48:59.360]  Even if you're not wealthy, that's just part of the culture.
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:04.423]  Even, you know, lower middle class Dutch people will have a little farm or a little cottage out at the lake.
[01:49:05.023 --> 01:49:08.909]  And there's a culture of liking to do this, and so you're absolutely right.
[01:49:08.909 --> 01:49:11.072]  People can pull out of the Euro.
[01:49:11.072 --> 01:49:16.580]  How can you have such industrious, hard-working people, and then be told they're all in debt?
[01:49:16.580 --> 01:49:18.844]  Because we've been maneuvered to this point.
[01:49:18.844 --> 01:49:19.445]  God bless you.
[01:49:19.445 --> 01:49:20.126]  Good to hear from you.
[01:49:20.126 --> 01:49:20.647]  Great points.
[01:49:22.878 --> 01:49:26.419]  When I was talking about gold being racist, I'm not joking.
[01:49:26.419 --> 01:49:30.941]  Africa has more minerals than any other continent in the world.
[01:49:30.941 --> 01:49:40.485]  Per square mile, it's joke level how they've got basically every trace element, every precious metal, resources out the wazoo.
[01:49:43.735 --> 01:49:52.601]  But whenever African countries try to ship out any of their own goods, they're called blood diamonds or they're called conflict minerals.
[01:49:52.601 --> 01:50:08.332]  What that means is Western combines don't let them sell their goods unless they go through them and then they warehouse the goods to artificially drive up the price and won't let African countries or individuals have any profit from that.
[01:50:09.904 --> 01:50:15.965]  If you do buy a diamond, you should basically, from my research, buy one they call a blood diamond.
[01:50:15.965 --> 01:50:20.686]  That means it actually might have come from somebody good or bad, you don't know.
[01:50:20.686 --> 01:50:24.147]  It didn't come through the Oppenheimers, De Beers, and that monopoly.
[01:50:24.147 --> 01:50:27.388]  But see all the trendies and the Hollywood movies and the ads.
[01:50:27.388 --> 01:50:29.068]  Don't buy a conflict diamond.
[01:50:29.068 --> 01:50:34.049]  Go to the store and buy a $20,000 ring for your wife, you know, that actually cost them $10.
[01:50:34.049 --> 01:50:39.490]  And, you know, don't actually... See how it's all inverted?
[01:50:41.266 --> 01:50:46.210]  And that's how they use a cause celeb or political correctness.
[01:50:46.210 --> 01:50:53.515]  It's like the World Wildlife Fund with Prince Bernhardt that founded it got caught running secret operations, poaching to make money.
[01:50:53.515 --> 01:50:54.736]  Of course.
[01:50:54.736 --> 01:50:57.178]  It's like whatever they say they do, they're the opposite.
[01:50:57.178 --> 01:50:58.219]  You understand?
[01:50:58.219 --> 01:50:58.659]  We'll be back.
[01:50:59.383 --> 01:51:03.487]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:03.487 --> 01:51:06.689]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:06.689 --> 01:51:08.311]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:08.311 --> 01:51:11.653]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:11.653 --> 01:51:13.155]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:51:13.155 --> 01:51:14.276]  Just won't quit.
[01:51:15.009 --> 01:51:17.333]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Minus Resources.

[01:51:30.407 --> 01:51:31.207]  This is Dan Pilla.
[01:51:31.207 --> 01:51:33.008]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:51:33.008 --> 01:51:34.649]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:34.649 --> 01:51:37.490]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:37.490 --> 01:51:39.771]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:39.771 --> 01:51:44.273]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:51:44.273 --> 01:51:48.235]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:51:48.235 --> 01:51:51.997]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[01:51:51.997 --> 01:51:52.317]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:51:52.317 --> 01:51:54.058]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.

[01:52:19.457 --> 01:52:22.879]  Due to overwhelming response, limited inventory is available.
[01:52:22.879 --> 01:52:25.421]  Be ready with survivalistcamps.com.
[01:52:25.421 --> 01:52:26.302]  Survivalist Camps.
[01:52:26.302 --> 01:52:28.423]  Providing your basic needs to survive.
[01:52:29.284 --> 01:52:38.186]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[01:52:38.186 --> 01:52:39.286]  Silver Lungs.
[01:52:39.286 --> 01:52:46.587]  With the addition of our unique lung delivery system, respiratory infections are targeted directly, where traditional oral administration simply cannot reach.
[01:52:46.587 --> 01:52:52.608]  This pioneering method also preserves the original particle sizes and delivers your silver solution directly into the bloodstream.
[01:52:52.608 --> 01:52:56.749]  See the Silver Lungs generator and lung delivery system at SilverLungs.com.
[01:52:56.749 --> 01:52:58.469]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[01:52:59.059 --> 01:53:00.841]  Honey, it's time for dinner.
[01:53:00.841 --> 01:53:02.703]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[01:53:02.703 --> 01:53:04.204]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[01:53:04.204 --> 01:53:05.746]  Mine is falling apart.
[01:53:05.746 --> 01:53:11.912]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[01:53:11.912 --> 01:53:15.135]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[01:53:15.135 --> 01:53:15.656]  What is that?
[01:53:15.956 --> 01:53:25.504]  Well, apparently, many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[01:53:25.504 --> 01:53:34.232]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[01:53:34.232 --> 01:53:34.852]  Wow!
[01:53:34.852 --> 01:53:36.173]  That sounds scary.
[01:53:36.173 --> 01:53:40.637]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold Shielded Wallet.
[01:53:40.637 --> 01:53:41.458]  Are they more expensive?
[01:53:41.886 --> 01:53:50.068]  No, in fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from IDStronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[01:53:50.068 --> 01:53:51.248]  Sounds great!
[01:53:51.248 --> 01:53:53.889]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[01:53:53.889 --> 01:53:57.950]  I want to be protected, and these wallets at IDStronghold.com look fantastic!
[01:54:27.253 --> 01:54:27.973]  I want to be clear.
[01:54:27.973 --> 01:54:31.155]  Alex Jones here back live.
[01:54:31.155 --> 01:54:34.677]  I'm not just here complaining and getting angry because I like to get mad.
[01:54:34.677 --> 01:54:37.438]  There's so much good stuff in the world.
[01:54:37.438 --> 01:54:39.239]  So much productivity.
[01:54:39.239 --> 01:54:41.961]  So many smart, cool people.
[01:54:41.961 --> 01:54:52.666]  And to just see a bunch of criminal elites use propaganda, phlegm phlegm, financial fraud to take over and to know they've got it out for us.
[01:54:52.666 --> 01:54:53.887]  I just want to beat these people.
[01:54:54.977 --> 01:54:59.838]  Doesn't mean we're going to have some utopia, but I want to reverse all of that.
[01:54:59.838 --> 01:55:02.179]  I want to try to build a better world.
[01:55:02.179 --> 01:55:05.299]  Doesn't mean I have all the answers.
[01:55:05.299 --> 01:55:08.200]  But during the break, I was reading these articles.
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:11.140]  They're up on Drudge and Infowars.
[01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:13.161]  Murderer of this young woman.
[01:55:13.161 --> 01:55:14.501]  Just shot her for no reason.
[01:55:14.501 --> 01:55:15.881]  He now admits to it.
[01:55:15.881 --> 01:55:18.762]  I chose San Francisco because it was a sanctuary city.
[01:55:21.604 --> 01:55:29.172]  And that is just wonderful virtue to just let anybody in and then let them commit crimes and let them stay here.
[01:55:29.172 --> 01:55:31.834]  Because they're an immigrant.
[01:55:31.834 --> 01:55:38.961]  Well, we've got to let women fly in from Europe and China and Africa and have their babies and be paid for.
[01:55:38.961 --> 01:55:40.042]  Because they're immigrants.
[01:55:40.042 --> 01:55:43.886]  I mean, okay, well, intellectually, how is that fair?
[01:55:43.886 --> 01:55:44.727]  Just they're an immigrant.
[01:55:48.922 --> 01:55:53.285]  It's like we post videos of the knockout game intensifying.
[01:55:53.285 --> 01:55:58.630]  And I see racist whites in there, a lot of them are just trolls, making mindless comments that only make it worse.
[01:55:58.630 --> 01:56:01.852]  And I see other liberal commenters going, more racism from Infowars!
[01:56:01.852 --> 01:56:02.533]  No, no.
[01:56:02.533 --> 01:56:06.536]  Showing racial attacks on whites is not racism.
[01:56:06.536 --> 01:56:10.319]  It's pointing out that there's racism against whites that needs to stop.
[01:56:10.319 --> 01:56:12.581]  Just like I'm against racism against anybody.
[01:56:12.581 --> 01:56:14.883]  It's not even racism, it's just attacking people.
[01:56:14.883 --> 01:56:16.224]  It's tribalism.
[01:56:17.142 --> 01:56:18.003]  There's another article.
[01:56:18.003 --> 01:56:25.869]  Two previously deported illegal immigrants allegedly murder two women in two states in 24 hours.
[01:56:25.869 --> 01:56:27.091]  This is the latest news.
[01:56:27.091 --> 01:56:32.035]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is coming to Kansas City for the National Council of the Race Conference.
[01:56:32.035 --> 01:56:33.276]  No, it's not a Klan rally.
[01:56:33.276 --> 01:56:36.178]  That's the National International Hispanic Group.
[01:56:36.178 --> 01:56:37.880]  The race.
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:39.521]  For African immigrants to St.
[01:56:39.521 --> 01:56:42.504]  Paul, it's starting to feel more like home.
[01:56:43.783 --> 01:56:44.904]  Yeah, you go to Minneapolis-St.
[01:56:44.904 --> 01:56:52.109]  Paul, the government purposely imports Muslims from Africa and gives them tax exemption that citizens don't get.
[01:56:52.109 --> 01:56:57.012]  My point is, do you understand this is the plan to balkanize the country?
[01:56:57.012 --> 01:56:59.854]  And to put it together where we don't get along.
[01:56:59.854 --> 01:57:07.359]  I'm going to go to John in Montana, Jeff, Joe, Rich, Wildman, everybody, briefly at the end of the hour.
[01:57:09.815 --> 01:57:14.339]  We sell high quality supplements to fund a lot of our operations here.
[01:57:14.339 --> 01:57:18.082]  The problem is I never know what's going to be a big seller, what's never, you know, not going to be a seller.
[01:57:18.082 --> 01:57:23.948]  I just know what is the best stuff out there, the highest quality, what top experts tell me is going to have the biggest effect.
[01:57:23.948 --> 01:57:31.094]  I use it all, from X2, nascent iodine, to super male vitality, to so many of the other products.
[01:57:31.094 --> 01:57:32.675]  It's a cocktail I take every day.
[01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:35.190]  And we are sold out.
[01:57:35.190 --> 01:57:37.571]  I'm going to try to work on this so this doesn't happen anymore.
[01:57:37.571 --> 01:57:43.413]  But you've got to buy the product, otherwise you don't have the money to buy the product right away, or it takes six weeks to get more of it made.
[01:57:43.413 --> 01:57:49.876]  Brain Force sold out, Liver Shield sold out, Prostagard sold out, Childe sold out, Occupower sold out.
[01:57:49.876 --> 01:57:51.517]  What we have?
[01:57:51.517 --> 01:57:54.318]  Survival Shield, Nacin Ion X2, selling out soon.
[01:57:54.318 --> 01:57:56.439]  Super Mill Vitality, selling out very soon.
[01:57:57.426 --> 01:58:00.289]  Super Female Vitality, selling out soon.
[01:58:00.289 --> 01:58:03.191]  Oxy Powder, selling out soon.
[01:58:03.191 --> 01:58:06.414]  Secret 12, Vitamin B12, Mythical Bottleman, in stock.
[01:58:06.414 --> 01:58:07.636]  Silver Bullet, in stock.
[01:58:07.636 --> 01:58:09.257]  Old Oregano, in stock.
[01:58:09.257 --> 01:58:11.059]  Winter Sun D3, in stock.

[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:13.381]  Lung Cleanse, in stock.
[01:58:13.381 --> 01:58:14.642]  Got plenty of all that.
[01:58:14.642 --> 01:58:15.383]  It's all excellent.
[01:58:16.894 --> 01:58:19.436]  But we're working on getting all those other best-selling items back.
[01:58:19.436 --> 01:58:21.298]  Your purchase funds the operation.
[01:58:21.298 --> 01:58:23.139]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:23.139 --> 01:58:25.021]  And here's the final coup de grâce.

[01:58:33.627 --> 01:58:35.649]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:35.649 --> 01:58:37.270]  Third hour, coming up.
[01:58:37.270 --> 01:58:37.831]  Stay with us.
[01:58:37.831 --> 01:58:39.192]  Cheryl Celencia, your call.
[01:58:39.192 --> 01:58:39.892]  First, I'm going to John.
[01:58:39.892 --> 01:58:40.393]  We'll come back.
[01:58:40.393 --> 01:58:45.537]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:48.809 --> 01:58:52.311]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:58:52.311 --> 01:59:00.555]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:59:00.555 --> 01:59:05.977]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:59:05.977 --> 01:59:08.519]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:59:18.735 --> 01:59:19.756]  Alex Jones here.
[01:59:19.756 --> 01:59:29.043]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:59:29.043 --> 01:59:32.826]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[01:59:32.826 --> 01:59:41.173]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[01:59:41.173 --> 01:59:43.535]  Visit Infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:59:43.535 --> 01:59:44.536]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:51.468 --> 01:59:54.053]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:04.864 --> 02:00:09.706]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.706 --> 02:00:11.287]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.287 --> 02:00:12.848]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.848 --> 02:00:17.030]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:21.092]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:39.107 --> 02:00:50.832]  There's a reason 19 years ago I got that music as intro music, about a year into my radio career, is because I always imaged the globalists as the imperial battle march.
[02:00:50.832 --> 02:00:53.393]  We're under attack.
[02:00:53.393 --> 02:00:57.695]  You don't think the government doesn't know that having more guns means less crime?
[02:00:57.695 --> 02:01:02.016]  They want our guns to dominate and control us.
[02:01:02.016 --> 02:01:03.457]  I know I'm stating obvious things here.
[02:01:05.506 --> 02:01:14.709]  But again, they know we're awake to the fact that government's illegitimate and rogue, so they want to direct our revolution at local government.
[02:01:14.709 --> 02:01:17.670]  We need to take local government over.
[02:01:17.670 --> 02:01:26.193]  And really, this broadcast, even though it's supported by the listeners and by people that are awake and who are the best people out there bar none, it's not even for you.
[02:01:27.739 --> 02:01:29.621]  It's not for me.
[02:01:29.621 --> 02:01:33.484]  It's to reach out to people that aren't awake and aren't involved.
[02:01:33.484 --> 02:01:36.147]  That caller earlier was in Germany talking to folks.
[02:01:36.147 --> 02:01:41.611]  He said he ended up waking them up after hanging out with them for a week about how the Second Amendment is key.
[02:01:41.611 --> 02:01:43.733]  And they were first scared of it, then they understood.
[02:01:43.733 --> 02:01:49.278]  I can deprogram people in a matter of hours.
[02:01:49.278 --> 02:01:50.960]  And that's what I'm so frustrated about.
[02:01:52.526 --> 02:01:55.328]  Is that I'll be at home at night and want to shoot videos.
[02:01:55.328 --> 02:01:57.230]  I want to be on air or all weekend.
[02:01:57.230 --> 02:02:01.973]  I wanted to do some productions, but everybody was off, which is fine.
[02:02:01.973 --> 02:02:08.058]  And then I actually get in here on Monday morning and I have been worried about this all weekend.
[02:02:08.058 --> 02:02:11.300]  I was in her on Sunday and I'm not even trying to whine.
[02:02:11.300 --> 02:02:13.562]  It's just, I just feel so nasty.
[02:02:13.562 --> 02:02:18.346]  I don't even want to look at Chris Christie anymore.
[02:02:18.346 --> 02:02:19.707]  And Hillary Clinton, I mean,
[02:02:21.138 --> 02:02:23.300]  This woman needs to be in prison!
[02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:26.382]  And I'll tell you what else I'm mad about.
[02:02:26.382 --> 02:02:34.448]  On a fundamental level, I genetically, at a cellular level, know that what I'm doing is dangerous.
[02:02:34.448 --> 02:02:38.151]  And I don't say that for effect, it's dangerous.
[02:02:38.151 --> 02:02:42.174]  Just the fact that Nut could walk up on the street and blow me away, whatever.
[02:02:42.174 --> 02:02:46.097]  Not to mention the government and all the rest of it, that if I told you all about it, you wouldn't believe it.
[02:02:49.747 --> 02:02:52.689]  It's weird to be in the Matrix and be awake and be around a bunch of zombies.
[02:02:52.689 --> 02:02:54.049]  That's all I'm trying to get at.
[02:02:54.049 --> 02:02:55.450]  John in Montana, thanks for holding.
[02:02:55.450 --> 02:02:55.950]  You're a trooper.
[02:02:55.950 --> 02:02:57.311]  I'm gonna go to Joe and others.
[02:02:57.311 --> 02:02:57.691]  Go ahead.
[02:02:57.691 --> 02:02:59.312]  Welcome.
[02:02:59.312 --> 02:03:00.813]  Yeah, hi.
[02:03:00.813 --> 02:03:05.555]  I think Greece, while it's sad, is kind of a distraction.
[02:03:05.555 --> 02:03:08.137]  I think we know that they want world government.
[02:03:08.137 --> 02:03:11.118]  I think we know they want Agenda 21.
[02:03:11.118 --> 02:03:13.680]  And we can see that they're trying to say that the U.S.
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:13.880]  is a
[02:03:15.024 --> 02:03:26.515]  As a pro-sharia law constitution, I think that that's where they're going with it, is to try to bring everybody underneath the caliphate that they publicly deny exists in Iraq right now.
[02:03:26.515 --> 02:03:39.747]  But I think that, as of right now, they're just trying to slowly edge the Muslims in and give Aztlan back to Mexico to continue the infighting so that they can still have a back-and-forth.
[02:03:40.060 --> 02:03:53.886]  Oh, we have the head of EU security saying they're going to turn Europe Muslim, and it's just weird to, like, be told, we're not just going to take your guns and your kids and forcibly inoculate you, we're going to bring in groups who historically don't promote freedom.
[02:03:53.886 --> 02:03:59.548]  I'm talking about radical Muslims, because radical Islam has taken over the Middle East.
[02:03:59.548 --> 02:04:02.729]  I mean, I went to high school, college with Muslim folks, Muslim friends.
[02:04:02.729 --> 02:04:04.350]  I like a lot of Muslims.
[02:04:04.350 --> 02:04:05.991]  I'm not an Islamophobe.
[02:04:06.752 --> 02:04:17.538]  But I am, just like I'm not a quote homophobe, but at the same time I'm told, we're going to teach your kids how to have oral sex with this, you know, and it's like, no you're not.
[02:04:17.538 --> 02:04:24.301]  You know, it's this boldness of the politically correct to tear down everything that was existing.
[02:04:24.301 --> 02:04:27.723]  When, I mean, where is there a place for free market and family?
[02:04:27.723 --> 02:04:29.724]  Where is there room for anything?
[02:04:29.724 --> 02:04:31.025]  And the answer is there is no room.
[02:04:32.935 --> 02:04:35.816]  They, uh, every exit they give you has a cliff attached to it.
[02:04:35.816 --> 02:04:41.037]  So, there's nothing we can really do, um, as far as, um, voting.
[02:04:41.037 --> 02:04:43.477]  We have to fire and arrest these people.
[02:04:43.477 --> 02:04:44.377]  And I'll go.
[02:04:44.377 --> 02:04:46.858]  Bye.
[02:04:46.858 --> 02:04:48.078]  You were gonna say something else, brother?
[02:04:48.078 --> 02:04:53.059]  Yeah, I think he thought we'd hung up on him.
[02:04:53.059 --> 02:04:56.220]  No, I mean, it's coming down to the point where they come to force be inoculate you.
[02:04:56.220 --> 02:04:56.800]  What do you do?
[02:04:56.800 --> 02:04:57.200]  I mean, you know.
[02:04:58.936 --> 02:05:04.237]  Do you want to know why the Greeks voted no in an overwhelming majority to get out of the European Union?
[02:05:04.237 --> 02:05:06.277]  Well, it goes back to the Troika swindle.
[02:05:06.277 --> 02:05:16.720]  As Kurt Nimmo writes, in June, the Truth Committee on Public Debt, established by the Speaker of the Greek Parliament, came to the conclusion that Greece should not pay this debt because it is illegal, illegitimate, and odious.
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:23.581]  The establishment media has hidden from view the facts behind the debt and has sided with the banks in declaring the population of Greece deserves austerity.
[02:05:23.581 --> 02:05:28.862]  And it's attended poverty and misery because of the Greek government's refusal to accept the harsh conditions of the Troika.
[02:05:28.882 --> 02:05:29.182]  We're good.
[02:05:59.025 --> 02:06:06.227]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[02:06:21.650 --> 02:06:23.271]  Toxic artificial additives.

[02:06:58.581 --> 02:06:59.522]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:06:59.522 --> 02:07:00.102]  Good, brother.
[02:07:00.102 --> 02:07:01.844]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:07:01.844 --> 02:07:03.786]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:07:03.786 --> 02:07:07.810]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:07:07.810 --> 02:07:12.855]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:07:12.855 --> 02:07:20.702]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:07:21.022 --> 02:07:24.267]  We did a super male and a super female vitality.
[02:07:24.267 --> 02:07:25.809]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:07:25.809 --> 02:07:28.834]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:07:28.834 --> 02:07:30.496]  Saving a ton of money there.
[02:07:30.496 --> 02:07:36.305]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated.
[02:07:36.545 --> 02:07:38.326]  Or maximum potency.
[02:07:38.326 --> 02:07:44.789]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience.
[02:07:44.789 --> 02:07:48.550]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[02:07:48.550 --> 02:07:50.331]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[02:07:50.331 --> 02:07:57.274]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:08:11.192 --> 02:08:18.903]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:28.382 --> 02:08:34.768]  Gerald Salente is riding a shotgun with us, taking your calls and covering the waterfront in this hour.
[02:08:34.768 --> 02:08:36.309]  Jeff wants to talk about the economy.
[02:08:36.309 --> 02:08:40.133]  Joe wants to talk about game over on the economy.
[02:08:40.133 --> 02:08:44.376]  Rich, Joshua, Wildman, we'll get to all of you with Gerald Salente.
[02:08:44.376 --> 02:08:52.524]  Gerald's been predicting a basically bond market bust and chain reaction the last few years and of course been focusing on Greece.
[02:08:54.224 --> 02:09:02.262]  But we see what I guess you could call direct democracy, something Gerald Cilente talks a lot about in Greece happening.
[02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:13.607]  My problem is, with such a dumbed-down public over here, they could have 51% vote to take the middle class's money and redistribute it to Goldman Sachs.
[02:09:13.607 --> 02:09:18.490]  But Gerald Cilente will say, well, we already have that with the banker bailouts of 2008.
[02:09:18.490 --> 02:09:23.994]  And they're clearly gearing up to start doing that in other Western countries.
[02:09:23.994 --> 02:09:28.897]  That has now happened in Greece, with them only letting them have 22 euros a day
[02:09:31.471 --> 02:09:40.359]  Out of their accounts and the Financial Times of London reporting Greek banks prepare plan to raid deposits to avert collapse.
[02:09:40.359 --> 02:09:48.787]  Greek banks preparing contingency plans for a possible bail-in of depositors amid fears the country is heading for financial collapse.
[02:09:49.622 --> 02:09:51.684]  Well, you should have enough money to let folks have it.
[02:09:51.684 --> 02:09:53.106]  Oh, but you don't.
[02:09:53.106 --> 02:10:07.060]  Bankers and business people with knowledge of the measures said this weekend, the plans was called for a haircut, that's a nice little euphemism, of at least 30% of deposits above 8,000 euros.
[02:10:07.060 --> 02:10:11.805]  Sketch out an increasingly likely scenario for at least one bank source to say.
[02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:22.324]  AFP reports sugar, flour, rice, panic Greek stock up on essentials.
[02:10:22.324 --> 02:10:27.326]  Greeks are hoarding cash and food this week amid mounting fears the economy could collapse.
[02:10:27.326 --> 02:10:32.889]  Cracking open their wallets only to stock up on essentials and stripping supermarket shelves in the process.
[02:10:32.889 --> 02:10:43.934]  Mothers, elderly men and university students were spotted pushing heavy overloaded trolleys or coming out of shops weighed down with bags of food with essentials such as sugar, flour and pasta at the top of the list.
[02:10:43.934 --> 02:10:44.134]  Yeah.
[02:10:47.236 --> 02:10:49.957]  Drug companies still supplying Greece after no vote.
[02:10:49.957 --> 02:10:53.419]  Pharmaceutical companies said Monday they would continue to supply medicines to Greece.
[02:10:53.419 --> 02:10:58.762]  For now, despite increased financial uncertainty, after Greece rejected the terms of the Rescue Package.
[02:10:58.762 --> 02:11:00.382]  The Rescue Package.
[02:11:00.382 --> 02:11:01.623]  I love how they spin it.
[02:11:01.623 --> 02:11:10.507]  Taking money out of your bank accounts, a haircut, putting you under austerity for debts that aren't yours is a Rescue Package.
[02:11:10.507 --> 02:11:13.269]  Latin America celebrates Greek austerity, no vote.
[02:11:14.383 --> 02:11:15.704]  Buenos Aires.
[02:11:15.704 --> 02:11:21.690]  Countries across Latin America congratulated Greece on its Sunday referendum in which voters rejected creditors' austerity demands.
[02:11:21.690 --> 02:11:36.546]  And that's because just like Africa, you'll have billion-dollar loans, three-billion-dollar loans, ten-billion-dollar loans, where over time you pay ten times or more what the amount was and never get out from under it.
[02:11:37.639 --> 02:11:45.762]  And then you find out the IMF and World Bank are just private bank fronts that loaned out digital money backed up by Western credit.
[02:11:45.762 --> 02:11:49.903]  Taxpayers.
[02:11:49.903 --> 02:11:54.725]  And then when the countries finally go belly up, the big banks come in and just take over the infrastructure.
[02:11:54.725 --> 02:12:00.407]  They'll finance a coup d'etat, the government doesn't play ball, and have them at gunpoint take control.
[02:12:00.407 --> 02:12:02.928]  And that's the new word out, and that's on Infowars.com.
[02:12:04.434 --> 02:12:06.196]  Kurt Demme wrote a story about it.
[02:12:06.196 --> 02:12:06.516]  U.S.
[02:12:06.516 --> 02:12:11.742]  preparing coup to prevent Greece from falling under Russian influence.
[02:12:11.742 --> 02:12:17.489]  Well, Gerald Salente is a best-selling author, researcher, political analyst, frequent guest here.
[02:12:17.489 --> 02:12:20.933]  Doesn't need any introduction.
[02:12:20.933 --> 02:12:24.737]  TrendsResearch.com is his website.
[02:12:25.618 --> 02:12:28.899]  And he joins us to talk about this situation.
[02:12:28.899 --> 02:12:33.241]  Do you think this is finally the big one that Ron Paul and others have been warning of?
[02:12:33.241 --> 02:12:46.727]  I mean, we had you on just two weeks ago talking about the ratcheting up of hysteria, the elites headed for the exits, governments and institutions hoarding gold while telling the public don't own it.
[02:12:46.727 --> 02:12:50.469]  Gerald Cilente, what do you make of the situation on the Greek islands?
[02:12:51.587 --> 02:12:52.488]  It's a big one.
[02:12:52.488 --> 02:12:59.353]  Even though Greece's GDP is a fraction of the Eurogroup's GDP, it still means a lot.
[02:12:59.353 --> 02:13:01.094]  Because there's a lot of discontent.
[02:13:01.094 --> 02:13:04.417]  I just got back from Europe last Wednesday.
[02:13:04.417 --> 02:13:11.242]  And there's a lot of discontent going around about what their governments are doing to the people.
[02:13:11.242 --> 02:13:19.429]  And the so-called austerity measures, which actually come down to robbing you of your pensions, raising taxes,
[02:13:20.169 --> 02:13:31.173]  Selling off valuable public assets to your buddies at discount rates and increasing the retirement age till after you die.
[02:13:31.173 --> 02:13:47.640]  So what this is really bringing about, it's empowering other nations such as Italy and Spain and Portugal that have been put under the yoke of repression, financial repression, by the
[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:51.023]  European Monetary Union.
[02:13:51.023 --> 02:13:52.786]  So this is really big.
[02:13:52.786 --> 02:13:58.533]  And you know, Alex, I was going back over some information that we wrote in the past.
[02:13:58.533 --> 02:14:00.375]  And this is from a Trends Journal.
[02:14:00.375 --> 02:14:02.838]  Oh, this was the winter of 2012.
[02:14:02.838 --> 02:14:03.859]  So it's actually
[02:14:08.122 --> 02:14:09.904]  The December 2011.
[02:14:09.904 --> 02:14:20.616]  And what they were doing back then is the Greek Prime Minister Papandreou had called for, you ready for this?
[02:14:20.616 --> 02:14:24.019]  A referendum on the austerity measures.
[02:14:25.031 --> 02:14:26.052]  People forgot that.
[02:14:26.052 --> 02:14:27.773]  I forgot that.
[02:14:27.773 --> 02:14:29.173]  And you know what happened?
[02:14:29.173 --> 02:14:33.836]  They got pressure from the European Union to call it off.
[02:14:33.836 --> 02:14:34.797]  So they did.
[02:14:34.797 --> 02:14:37.478]  Because the guy was obviously a coward.
[02:14:37.478 --> 02:14:39.640]  So this is very big what happened.
[02:14:40.260 --> 02:14:45.285]  And whether or not they voted yes or no really makes no difference.
[02:14:45.285 --> 02:14:58.939]  The difference is that the people have taken the future into their own hands, whereby they weren't going to be dictated to be robbed more from the International Mafia Federation, better known as the IMF.
[02:14:59.580 --> 02:15:01.821]  And the World Bank and the hedge funds.
[02:15:01.821 --> 02:15:16.986]  Who made this baloney up that if banks and hedge funds and private equity groups and what they love to call investors, as adults call gamblers, made bad bets and we the people have to pay them off?
[02:15:16.986 --> 02:15:18.347]  They lost their money!
[02:15:18.347 --> 02:15:21.428]  This is bankers' money that was lost.
[02:15:21.428 --> 02:15:25.249]  Why are they putting the onus on the people to pay them off?
[02:15:25.249 --> 02:15:26.530]  I'll tell you why.
[02:15:26.530 --> 02:15:27.390]  Because it's called
[02:15:27.970 --> 02:15:29.431]  Fascism!
[02:15:29.431 --> 02:15:32.474]  The merger of state and corporate powers!
[02:15:32.474 --> 02:15:41.321]  Nothing has changed, Alex, since the days of Jesus Christ chasing the money changers out of the temple!
[02:15:41.321 --> 02:15:43.864]  They just have official names now!
[02:15:43.864 --> 02:15:46.005]  They're Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan's...
[02:15:46.886 --> 02:15:57.312]  Chase, their Royal Bank of Scotland, their Societe Generale, the money changers have names.
[02:15:57.312 --> 02:16:04.777]  And then when you look at the scam going on, who's the guy that runs the European Central Bank?
[02:16:04.777 --> 02:16:10.120]  Couldn't be Mario Draghi, former vice chairman of the Goldman Sachs gang of the European division.
[02:16:10.663 --> 02:16:17.886]  Who's the guy they put up as a so-called technocrat in Greece that was going to straighten this all out two years ago?
[02:16:17.886 --> 02:16:20.067]  Oh yeah, another guy, Papademos.
[02:16:20.067 --> 02:16:24.929]  Hey, wasn't he with the... Wasn't he with the Goldman Sachs gang too?
[02:16:24.929 --> 02:16:26.409]  And the rest of the group?
[02:16:26.409 --> 02:16:27.950]  Of course he was.
[02:16:27.950 --> 02:16:36.313]  So this, all this is, it's a banking takeover and they want to paint it in another color to make it seem what it isn't.
[02:16:38.968 --> 02:16:42.030]  Well, I can't say it any better, Gerald, than what you just broke down.
[02:16:42.030 --> 02:16:56.017]  I would expect now to see the global mafia tear Greece to pieces and blame their economic collapse further into degradation
[02:16:57.100 --> 02:16:58.922]  On the Greek people.
[02:16:58.922 --> 02:17:11.793]  I know that areas of Latin America like Argentina that were pegged to the dollar and bought into globalism went from one of the wealthiest countries in the hemisphere to one of the poorest in just a decade.
[02:17:12.867 --> 02:17:18.591]  I know you've traveled down there to see it for yourself, but it's a total transformation.
[02:17:18.591 --> 02:17:30.859]  These globalists will suck countries dry, they will create squalor, they will consolidate control, and they'll call it free market and scapegoat capitalism while they're at it.
[02:17:30.859 --> 02:17:32.680]  So I think it's key that Greece
[02:17:34.206 --> 02:17:41.534]  Let's not pay the taxes and grow their own food as they're starting to do and just totally break with the system.
[02:17:41.534 --> 02:17:53.969]  I think that the establishment is going to push so far that whether it's Greece or some other country, they're going to force people to go back to nationalism and back to sovereignty and back to the interests of the people.
[02:17:55.621 --> 02:17:57.482]  You summed it up perfectly.
[02:17:57.482 --> 02:18:02.763]  And that's, by the way, I read that article on InfoWars about the U.S.
[02:18:02.763 --> 02:18:14.386]  preparing for a coup, you know, to really destabilize this area because they made the people, we the people over there, you know, decided what they wanted.
[02:18:14.386 --> 02:18:16.107]  And that, you can't have any of that.
[02:18:16.767 --> 02:18:18.288]  So you're exactly right.
[02:18:18.288 --> 02:18:28.253]  What this is doing, it's showing the people that they don't need the European Central Bank, Brussels, as the mafia controlling them.
[02:18:28.253 --> 02:18:30.575]  Their destiny is in their own hands.
[02:18:30.575 --> 02:18:36.358]  Look, they have about $350 billion in debt.
[02:18:36.358 --> 02:18:40.200]  You saw the GDP of Greece decline some 30%.
[02:18:42.381 --> 02:18:48.405]  Since this whole austerity measure thing began, and as you point out, who do they blame?
[02:18:48.405 --> 02:18:54.409]  Let's blame the people, because they got social benefits, and they're living off the, you know, government.
[02:18:54.409 --> 02:18:57.071]  They're not talking about the dirty deals that are made.
[02:18:57.071 --> 02:18:58.852]  Hey, you know what they haven't cut, Alex?
[02:18:59.432 --> 02:19:01.213]  The defense budget.
[02:19:01.213 --> 02:19:03.215]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[02:19:03.215 --> 02:19:07.418]  The same thing like that guy, what's his name over there, did over in Wisconsin.
[02:19:07.418 --> 02:19:10.060]  That guy with the big mouth and the little mind.
[02:19:10.060 --> 02:19:11.320]  Let's see, he's running for President.
[02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:12.561]  Walker, that's it.
[02:19:12.561 --> 02:19:13.682]  Scott Walker.
[02:19:13.682 --> 02:19:20.627]  Yeah, we're going to get rid of all those unions, those public unions, but we're not going to touch the police.
[02:19:20.627 --> 02:19:22.689]  Same deal, man.
[02:19:22.689 --> 02:19:24.370]  It's one big group.
[02:19:24.890 --> 02:19:32.995]  And they want the military in control to put down the people when they get out of line.
[02:19:32.995 --> 02:19:36.037]  And that's what they're doing there.
[02:19:36.037 --> 02:19:36.537]  Stay there.
[02:19:36.537 --> 02:19:38.998]  Gerald Cilente is our guest.
[02:19:38.998 --> 02:19:39.759]  One thing is clear.
[02:19:40.905 --> 02:19:43.626]  There are big problems inside the world government.
[02:19:43.626 --> 02:19:47.247]  We're going to break it down and take your phone calls straight ahead.
[02:19:47.247 --> 02:19:50.388]  We're also going to look at campaign 2016.
[02:19:50.388 --> 02:19:57.791]  Chris Christie blames Rand Paul for any terror attacks that come when Rand Paul fought against arming Al Qaeda.
[02:20:02.532 --> 02:20:04.753]  Tired of the garbage on the radio?
[02:20:04.753 --> 02:20:06.594]  Let's change hip-hop.

[02:20:59.439 --> 02:20:59.999]  Good, brother.
[02:20:59.999 --> 02:21:01.940]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:03.660]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:21:03.660 --> 02:21:07.701]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:21:07.701 --> 02:21:10.322]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:21:10.322 --> 02:21:12.743]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:21:12.743 --> 02:21:20.705]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:21:21.005 --> 02:21:24.149]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[02:21:24.149 --> 02:21:25.690]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:21:25.690 --> 02:21:30.376]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, saving a ton of money there.
[02:21:30.376 --> 02:21:35.862]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[02:21:35.862 --> 02:21:36.162]  We're good.
[02:21:58.442 --> 02:22:00.224]  Honey, it's time for dinner.
[02:22:00.224 --> 02:22:02.086]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[02:22:02.086 --> 02:22:03.587]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[02:22:03.587 --> 02:22:05.129]  Mine is falling apart.
[02:22:05.129 --> 02:22:11.295]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[02:22:11.295 --> 02:22:14.518]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[02:22:14.518 --> 02:22:15.039]  What is that?
[02:22:15.359 --> 02:22:24.901]  Well, apparently, many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[02:22:24.901 --> 02:22:33.603]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[02:22:33.603 --> 02:22:34.223]  Wow!
[02:22:34.223 --> 02:22:35.563]  That sounds scary!
[02:22:35.563 --> 02:22:40.004]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold Shielded Wallet.
[02:22:40.004 --> 02:22:40.824]  Are they more expensive?
[02:22:41.264 --> 02:22:41.785]  No.
[02:22:41.785 --> 02:22:49.471]  In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from idstronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[02:22:49.471 --> 02:22:50.652]  Sounds great!
[02:22:50.652 --> 02:22:53.294]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[02:22:53.294 --> 02:22:57.357]  I want to be protected, and these wallets at idstronghold.com look fantastic!
[02:22:58.257 --> 02:23:04.480]  It's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the industry leader, My Patriot Supply.

[02:24:30.526 --> 02:24:31.907]  Gerald Salente is our guest.
[02:24:31.907 --> 02:24:37.149]  I want to go to Rich and Joe and others that are patiently holding Joe first.
[02:24:37.149 --> 02:24:40.870]  But after we take some calls, we're going to get back into other news.
[02:24:40.870 --> 02:24:44.892]  Gerald, what else are you looking at on your radar screen of importance?
[02:24:44.892 --> 02:24:50.534]  We see the Puerto Rico governor coming out last week and saying they're insolvent.
[02:24:50.534 --> 02:24:54.116]  Well, pretty much most counties and cities are insolvent.
[02:24:55.188 --> 02:25:00.435]  But we're told by the leader of the free world that raising our debt doesn't raise our debt.
[02:25:00.435 --> 02:25:04.419]  We don't know when all this is going to unravel, but it looks like we're getting closer to it.
[02:25:04.419 --> 02:25:06.102]  What's going to happen when it unravels?
[02:25:07.363 --> 02:25:10.865]  Well, what is going to happen is you're going to start seeing panic in the streets.
[02:25:10.865 --> 02:25:12.666]  Take what's going on in Greece.
[02:25:12.666 --> 02:25:21.732]  How could any thinking human being that's living in that country have left money in the bank knowing that this was going to happen?
[02:25:21.732 --> 02:25:23.394]  So, you mentioned Puerto Rico.
[02:25:23.394 --> 02:25:25.515]  They're doing the same thing.
[02:25:25.515 --> 02:25:26.395]  How about this?
[02:25:27.296 --> 02:25:28.917]  People have lost their jobs.
[02:25:28.917 --> 02:25:30.438]  They have a huge unemployment.
[02:25:30.438 --> 02:25:35.122]  What, about 40% of the people are on some form of welfare.
[02:25:35.122 --> 02:25:36.203]  I got it.
[02:25:36.203 --> 02:25:39.565]  Let's raise taxes on the people.
[02:25:39.565 --> 02:25:41.607]  That's what they just did.
[02:25:41.607 --> 02:25:44.189]  They all do these stupid things.
[02:25:44.189 --> 02:25:49.373]  And then you start putting all the pieces together, what's going on around the world.
[02:25:49.373 --> 02:25:52.835]  And one of the... You just asked me what else is on our radar.
[02:25:52.835 --> 02:25:54.437]  How about China?
[02:25:55.472 --> 02:25:58.855]  That's basically out of the news.
[02:25:58.855 --> 02:26:06.163]  The markets there are down some 30% after having gone up, what, about over 100% in 12 months.
[02:26:06.163 --> 02:26:08.045]  Down 30% since the middle of June.
[02:26:08.045 --> 02:26:08.505]  So now,
[02:26:13.601 --> 02:26:17.505]  Here's what's going on when people say, are the markets rigged?
[02:26:17.505 --> 02:26:28.938]  Of course they are, but they love to use that proper language to make it seem as though we're all so stupid because it's white-shoe boy talk.
[02:26:28.938 --> 02:26:33.102]  This is the headline of today's Financial Times.
[02:26:33.102 --> 02:26:33.503]  Here it is.
[02:26:35.393 --> 02:26:42.195]  China pumps liquidity into markets in fresh attempt to halt share selloff.
[02:26:42.195 --> 02:26:44.716]  Remember, this is the big story.
[02:26:44.716 --> 02:26:46.297]  Pump liquidity?
[02:26:46.297 --> 02:26:48.657]  How about rigging the markets?
[02:26:48.657 --> 02:26:50.898]  Could anybody say that?
[02:26:50.898 --> 02:26:54.700]  Aren't markets supposed to take their natural course?
[02:26:54.700 --> 02:26:56.320]  Of course not!
[02:26:56.320 --> 02:26:59.521]  Not when you have to keep the Ponzi scheme going.
[02:26:59.521 --> 02:27:01.082]  Gerald, I remember 10 years ago...
[02:27:02.282 --> 02:27:07.764]  We'd have Ron Paul on talking about the Plunge Protection Team and markets being rigged and people didn't believe us.
[02:27:07.764 --> 02:27:24.171]  Now they admit the currencies are rigged every day, the interest rates are rigged, the stock market's rigged, and I love how they just hide it in plain view like it's a good thing now, and they say we're going to take money out of your private bank account and give it to shadowy groups.
[02:27:24.171 --> 02:27:25.532]  That's a haircut!
[02:27:25.532 --> 02:27:27.133]  Again, white shoe boy language.
[02:27:27.913 --> 02:27:36.117]  Yeah, and you mentioned what Ron Paul said, and this isn't conspiracy theory.
[02:27:36.117 --> 02:27:48.582]  These guys get convicted, convicted, not charged, convicted of felonies for rigging the LIBOR rate, the interest rates, and the forex market, the currency markets.
[02:27:48.582 --> 02:27:53.725]  They're convicted, and not one person goes to jail.
[02:27:54.932 --> 02:27:55.932]  So that's what it is.
[02:27:55.932 --> 02:27:57.593]  They're rigging the markets.
[02:27:57.593 --> 02:28:00.134]  It's in front of everybody's eyes.
[02:28:00.134 --> 02:28:02.795]  The Chinese are proudly announcing it.
[02:28:02.795 --> 02:28:10.978]  If you go to Global Times, one of their biggest news outlets, they're saying that how they're going to
[02:28:11.958 --> 02:28:15.121]  You know, create stability in the markets.
[02:28:15.121 --> 02:28:16.822]  You're rigging the markets.
[02:28:16.822 --> 02:28:26.089]  And by the way, the Chinese market is very important because a lot of this money are the so-called retail investors.
[02:28:26.089 --> 02:28:29.132]  These are people that are gambling, that don't know what they're doing.
[02:28:29.132 --> 02:28:31.554]  And they have a huge amount of margin calls.
[02:28:31.974 --> 02:28:34.516]  Now you add up what's going on.
[02:28:34.516 --> 02:28:40.240]  I mentioned to you how much the market has gone up in China over the last year, over 100%.
[02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:49.106]  That was also equivalent to about 1.3% of add-on to their GDP.
[02:28:49.106 --> 02:28:53.969]  So they're actually, in looking at declines, way beyond what they're reporting.
[02:28:54.449 --> 02:29:02.296]  So when you put all this together, what's going on in Europe, what's going on in China, what's going on in Brazil is in a recession.
[02:29:02.296 --> 02:29:07.920]  You're looking at destabilization in places like now that's not making the news in America.
[02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:14.466]  The globe is on fire and the collapse clearly has been ongoing and is speeding up right now.
[02:29:14.466 --> 02:29:16.628]  If China's stock market starts tanking,
[02:29:17.208 --> 02:29:19.889]  Which headlines say it's begun.
[02:29:19.889 --> 02:29:22.369]  You can guarantee that's going to hit our markets.
[02:29:22.369 --> 02:29:24.229]  I want to get your take on what you think's next.
[02:29:24.229 --> 02:29:28.630]  Gerald Salente, the Trends Forecaster, and your phone calls.
[02:29:28.630 --> 02:29:36.272]  I promise when we come back we're going right to Joe, and Rich, and Wildman, and Jeff, and Joshua, and everybody straight ahead.
[02:29:36.272 --> 02:29:44.034]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the websites, and we'll put Gerald's on screen as well when we come back.
[02:29:44.034 --> 02:29:44.674]  Stay with us.
[02:29:44.674 --> 02:29:45.874]  Key information straight ahead.
[02:29:48.203 --> 02:29:52.156]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.156 --> 02:29:54.844]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.996 --> 02:30:04.479]  Presidential candidate Chris Christie wants Americans to blame Rand Paul for terror attacks that haven't even happened yet.
[02:30:04.479 --> 02:30:06.761]  Here is what he told Morning Joe viewers.
[02:30:06.761 --> 02:30:12.224]  What Rand Paul has done to make the country weaker and more vulnerable is a terrible thing.
[02:30:12.224 --> 02:30:23.231]  As the only guy who used the Patriot Act in this race as a former prosecutor, we're going to look back on this and he should be in front of hearings and in front of Congress if there's another attack.
[02:30:23.231 --> 02:30:26.213]  Not the director of the FBI or the director of the CIA.
[02:30:26.673 --> 02:30:27.773]  That's right, Governor Christie.
[02:30:27.773 --> 02:30:33.616]  We shouldn't look at the FBI, even though almost every terror attack on this country has happened with the help of an FBI informant.
[02:30:33.616 --> 02:30:39.759]  Or what about the statements made by Agent Thomas Fuentes, who said we have to keep the fear alive in order to justify budget increases.
[02:30:39.759 --> 02:30:50.903]  And then back in 2009, former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge claimed that he was pressured by members of George Bush's cabinet to raise the national terror alert level just before the 2004 presidential election.
[02:30:50.903 --> 02:30:52.824]  No, we shouldn't look at those guys.
[02:30:52.824 --> 02:30:53.564]  That's right, Christie.
[02:30:53.564 --> 02:30:55.025]  You really have your priorities straight.
[02:30:55.205 --> 02:30:58.967]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:30:58.967 --> 02:31:05.189]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the waters.
[02:31:05.189 --> 02:31:07.891]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:31:07.891 --> 02:31:14.934]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:31:14.934 --> 02:31:17.755]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:31:17.935 --> 02:31:20.936]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:31:20.936 --> 02:31:22.876]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:31:22.876 --> 02:31:25.817]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:31:25.817 --> 02:31:31.538]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:31:31.538 --> 02:31:35.058]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:31:35.058 --> 02:31:38.119]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:31:38.119 --> 02:31:42.380]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.
[02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:45.464]  For every modern independently minded household.
[02:31:45.464 --> 02:31:48.667]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[02:31:48.667 --> 02:31:55.676]  Go to Infowarsstore.com today to purchase your ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:31:58.737 --> 02:32:15.383]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website InfoWars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[02:32:15.383 --> 02:32:18.904]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[02:32:19.244 --> 02:32:23.289]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[02:32:23.289 --> 02:32:24.851]  hdfirearms.com.
[02:32:24.851 --> 02:32:28.174]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs and Special Ops people.
[02:32:28.174 --> 02:32:33.300]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[02:32:33.300 --> 02:32:34.121]  It's always about security.
[02:32:34.121 --> 02:32:34.501]  I think so.
[02:33:20.763 --> 02:33:24.505]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:24.505 --> 02:33:34.970]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:34.970 --> 02:33:36.871]  FriendsResearch.com is his website.
[02:33:36.871 --> 02:33:37.711]  Joe Sloan is our guest.
[02:33:37.711 --> 02:33:42.393]  We're going to take your phone calls here in just a moment.
[02:33:42.393 --> 02:33:48.196]  When I get up on air and start apologizing for being in a bad mood, it's because I'm in such a bad mood, I feel like you can feel it.
[02:33:49.716 --> 02:33:51.937]  And in truth, I talked to the crew and others, they go, everything's fine.
[02:33:51.937 --> 02:33:54.477]  You don't need to stop apologizing.
[02:33:54.477 --> 02:34:01.219]  But I just am physically panicking almost because I know history and I know where this is going.
[02:34:01.219 --> 02:34:09.281]  And I've also seen things in my own personal life that I really don't want to see repeated.
[02:34:09.281 --> 02:34:11.961]  And then I realized we don't just have bad management.
[02:34:11.961 --> 02:34:19.003]  We have really evil management that could cause a nuclear war or anything else for that matter.
[02:34:20.177 --> 02:34:31.446]  And yes, the world's waking up to a certain extent, but at the same time, a lot of people are so dumbed down they can't even tell you what the Declaration of Independence is or what July 4th stands for.
[02:34:31.446 --> 02:34:34.388]  And that fundamentally gets me down.
[02:34:34.388 --> 02:34:42.214]  I believe the people are the answer, but also the population tuning into mainstream media is not the answer.
[02:34:42.214 --> 02:34:46.578]  But we know with austerity, people tend to start really waking up.
[02:34:46.578 --> 02:34:47.799]  Humanity is amazing.
[02:34:47.799 --> 02:34:49.020]  We have unlimited potential.
[02:34:49.875 --> 02:34:57.757]  But if we continue to follow the modern systems of globalism, we have no future.
[02:34:57.757 --> 02:35:02.679]  I'm going to ask Gerald Cilente what he thinks the next shoot-a-drop is, and we're going right to your phone calls.
[02:35:02.679 --> 02:35:06.260]  Briefly, this broadcast is listener-supported.
[02:35:06.260 --> 02:35:17.303]  When you buy the high-quality water filters, or you buy shortwave radios, or ProGun t-shirts, or any of the, it's over 500 items now, at InfoWarsStore.com,
[02:35:18.993 --> 02:35:25.960]  You are making this transmission possible.
[02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:40.775]  And, you know, speaking of management, I personally need to spend more time on trying to figure out how to fund this news operation so that I can expand and do a lot of the big things that I want to be able to do.
[02:35:42.025 --> 02:35:45.026]  We have free shipping throughout the month of July.
[02:35:45.026 --> 02:35:49.707]  We have 25% off on the Made in America Molon Labe.
[02:35:49.707 --> 02:35:50.387]  Come and take it.
[02:35:50.387 --> 02:35:51.547]  Belt buckles.
[02:35:51.547 --> 02:35:54.648]  We have a bunch of specials on the nutraceuticals.
[02:35:54.648 --> 02:36:01.670]  For anybody that really is in business of manufacturing and producing especially high quality nutraceuticals,
[02:36:03.422 --> 02:36:03.642]  I think so.
[02:36:33.789 --> 02:36:48.440]  I'm tempted to do some type of mega sale or a money bomb or something to get positioned to stockpile all the products so that we can then meet demand, which nobody can guess or judge, so that we can go to the next level.
[02:36:48.440 --> 02:36:55.986]  That's why I say it's critical that folks support InfoWars.com right now because we're in a catch-22.
[02:36:55.986 --> 02:37:02.051]  I only ordered a test amount of Brain Force, Liver Shield, Prostagard, Child Ease, and Occupower.
[02:37:02.793 --> 02:37:06.714]  They're all sold out.
[02:37:06.714 --> 02:37:11.696]  The best news we have is one of them's in in a month, some of them won't be in for two months.
[02:37:11.696 --> 02:37:13.097]  Well, there's our best sellers right there.
[02:37:13.097 --> 02:37:16.118]  Brain Force, Liver Shield, Prostagard, Childe's, Occupower.
[02:37:17.031 --> 02:37:21.172]  So that's not a sales tactic to get it while you can, folks, because we're selling out.
[02:37:21.172 --> 02:37:22.372]  Step right up.
[02:37:22.372 --> 02:37:25.173]  It's the truth that we're sold out of it.
[02:37:25.173 --> 02:37:26.253]  We have the DNA Force.
[02:37:26.253 --> 02:37:27.314]  We have the Oxy-Powder.
[02:37:27.314 --> 02:37:30.474]  We have the Colloidal Silver, high quality at a low price.
[02:37:30.474 --> 02:37:33.455]  We have the Secret 12 Mythical Balamon.
[02:37:33.455 --> 02:37:36.496]  The Oil of Oregano is back in.
[02:37:36.496 --> 02:37:39.137]  We have the Lung Cleanse.
[02:37:39.137 --> 02:37:43.578]  We're selling out of both Super Male and Super Female Vitality in the next two weeks.
[02:37:44.887 --> 02:37:47.869]  And we are selling out of Survival Shield X2, and that is our best seller.
[02:37:47.869 --> 02:37:50.830]  That's the bad news, that we had a limited amount that they had.
[02:37:50.830 --> 02:37:54.012]  They manufactured more, now they're trying to get more of the crystals.
[02:37:54.012 --> 02:38:02.257]  And we'll still at least have Survival Shield Original, if we're not able to continue to manufacture that.
[02:38:02.257 --> 02:38:04.358]  So, that's just how this works.
[02:38:04.358 --> 02:38:09.821]  This is not a bunch of filler, then a bunch of advertising attached to it.
[02:38:09.821 --> 02:38:13.323]  These are super high quality products.
[02:38:17.591 --> 02:38:29.498]  I mean, quite frankly, we changed the formulation of Supermail because one of the ingredients was so rare that we were extincting in production, you know, where you could get organic shilajit.
[02:38:31.013 --> 02:38:33.795]  So we just went ahead and went with two other ingredients and souped it up.
[02:38:33.795 --> 02:38:40.861]  I mean, it's a real juggling act, and one of my frustrations is I've got to spend a lot of my time trying to fund this operation.
[02:38:40.861 --> 02:38:43.583]  But hey, that's what proves the American way.
[02:38:43.583 --> 02:38:45.045]  We're self-funded.
[02:38:45.045 --> 02:38:48.488]  I'm not controlled by sponsors or by some outside network.
[02:38:48.488 --> 02:38:59.517]  I can say what I want and do what I want because you have believed in us and supported us and put up with me, quite frankly, and bought the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the supplements.
[02:39:00.779 --> 02:39:03.141]  The water filtration systems, all of it.
[02:39:03.141 --> 02:39:05.142]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[02:39:05.142 --> 02:39:09.285]  If you want to get Survival Shield X2, now is the time to secure it.
[02:39:09.285 --> 02:39:11.968]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:39:11.968 --> 02:39:16.611]  If you want to get any of the other products that are still available, like Super Male or Female,
[02:39:19.346 --> 02:39:29.952]  Again, we have three manufacturers for something like 14 products, and you get in the queue with these people, and the problem is, they say, well, which product do you want us to do within four weeks?
[02:39:29.952 --> 02:39:30.613]  We can only do one.
[02:39:30.613 --> 02:39:32.254]  Then we've got to do the next one.
[02:39:32.254 --> 02:39:34.335]  So that's eight weeks.
[02:39:34.335 --> 02:39:38.297]  And so, again, you have a bunch of products sold out, only three manufacturers.
[02:39:38.297 --> 02:39:39.298]  That's how you run into it.
[02:39:39.298 --> 02:39:42.220]  So I'm just explaining why we're in this situation.
[02:39:44.039 --> 02:39:52.301]  We'd be in a great situation if I had a crystal ball and had bought more of, say, Brain Force or Liver Shield, but this stuff knocks your socks off.
[02:39:52.301 --> 02:39:54.542]  It really works great.
[02:39:54.542 --> 02:39:59.303]  But then I can't judge the listeners what they're into.
[02:39:59.303 --> 02:40:05.164]  I mean, I'm into all of this, but people will pick this to be a hot item when I think this is really hot.
[02:40:05.164 --> 02:40:06.365]  And that's just the way it works.
[02:40:06.365 --> 02:40:11.566]  So, as you notice, the fact that things are selling out is not hype.
[02:40:12.853 --> 02:40:17.474]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:40:17.474 --> 02:40:19.575]  But I know that God will always provide.
[02:40:19.575 --> 02:40:22.235]  And again, Infowars is doing good overall.
[02:40:22.235 --> 02:40:26.256]  We have the subscriptions for the Nightly News and we have some sponsors.
[02:40:26.256 --> 02:40:35.759]  I just refuse most sponsors because I have to test it and check it and I have to get great reviews from listeners because I just can't have booze.
[02:40:35.759 --> 02:40:36.839]  One time Willie Nelson told me that.
[02:40:36.839 --> 02:40:41.100]  We're sitting around at his house and he goes, there's a few things in life I don't really like Alex.
[02:40:42.975 --> 02:40:45.298]  One of them's booze.
[02:40:45.298 --> 02:40:47.580]  You know that song?
[02:40:47.580 --> 02:40:50.944]  By who is it?
[02:40:50.944 --> 02:40:52.666]  Is it Hank Williams Jr.?
[02:40:52.666 --> 02:40:57.671]  I like happy and I'm not into sad.
[02:40:57.671 --> 02:40:59.793]  And the song goes on.
[02:40:59.793 --> 02:41:03.978]  And I like to have women I've never had.
[02:41:05.356 --> 02:41:07.018]  That's a racy song.
[02:41:07.018 --> 02:41:08.940]  That Hank Williams Jr.
[02:41:08.940 --> 02:41:12.604]  I'm glad they've taken him off the Super Bowl and Monday Night Football.
[02:41:12.604 --> 02:41:17.349]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:41:17.349 --> 02:41:18.690]  Willie Nelson did say that to me.
[02:41:18.690 --> 02:41:21.253]  He didn't say the part about, I like to have women I've never had.
[02:41:22.592 --> 02:41:23.912]  I'm not name-dropping.
[02:41:23.912 --> 02:41:27.474]  My whole life is an absolute Twilight Zone event.
[02:41:27.474 --> 02:41:28.034]  And you know what?
[02:41:28.034 --> 02:41:29.754]  Reality is a Twilight Zone event.
[02:41:29.754 --> 02:41:35.316]  Okay, I apologize to Gerald Cilente for ranting, but we're doing some mid-air refueling to fund the operation.
[02:41:35.316 --> 02:41:39.518]  And speaking of that, you should go and subscribe to his quarterly TrendsResearch.com.
[02:41:39.518 --> 02:41:42.339]  Gerald Cilente is our guest, and Gerald wrote me a very nice letter.
[02:41:42.339 --> 02:41:43.659]  I need to talk to him soon.
[02:41:43.659 --> 02:41:46.280]  He's got a big event coming up in New York.
[02:41:47.487 --> 02:41:52.654]  So I want to tell folks about that conference, and of course have you on when that conference comes up, Gerald.
[02:41:52.654 --> 02:41:56.198]  I'm not sure if I can attend yet, but we're going to work on that.
[02:41:56.198 --> 02:42:00.664]  But Gerald Cilente joins us from Kingston, Colonial Kingston.
[02:42:00.664 --> 02:42:04.188]  Gerald, I've been ranting there.
[02:42:04.188 --> 02:42:05.990]  What do you think the next big shoe to drop is?
[02:42:06.650 --> 02:42:09.572]  Well, first of all, you weren't ranting at all.
[02:42:09.572 --> 02:42:17.399]  You're selling natural healing products, and whole health healing is one of the biggest trends that we see.
[02:42:17.399 --> 02:42:31.270]  And you have an audience of people that are enlightened, looking for new directions, and are not prescription drug addicted, and want to find other ways of staying healthy physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[02:42:31.270 --> 02:42:34.893]  So the list of products that you read, and what you're offering,
[02:42:35.413 --> 02:42:43.239]  And how people can keep this truth and freedom going is really another service that you're providing.
[02:42:43.239 --> 02:42:50.604]  And as you said, it's not a sales pitch, because when you go down the line of products, who doesn't want the best water filter?
[02:42:50.604 --> 02:42:58.610]  Unless, of course, you like drinking, you know, fluoride, chemically induced and toxic water, or all those other products.
[02:42:58.610 --> 02:43:00.372]  And if the people don't support us,
[02:43:01.112 --> 02:43:11.238]  You know, keep supporting the people that are robbing us of our rights, and robbing us not only of our rights, but of our livelihood as well.
[02:43:11.238 --> 02:43:13.199]  So no, you weren't ranting.
[02:43:13.199 --> 02:43:19.003]  And you said you were depressed because of the masses that are so out of touch.
[02:43:19.003 --> 02:43:23.105]  So I have this little quote here that really says it all.
[02:43:23.105 --> 02:43:27.288]  It's by Samuel Adams, and he said, it doesn't take a majority
[02:43:29.346 --> 02:43:38.913]  But rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men.
[02:43:38.913 --> 02:43:50.241]  It does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men.
[02:43:50.241 --> 02:43:51.602]  And that's what you're doing.
[02:43:51.602 --> 02:43:52.963]  That's what I'm doing.
[02:43:52.963 --> 02:43:55.065]  That's what Dr. Paul Craig Roberts does.
[02:43:55.065 --> 02:43:56.346]  That's what Ron Paul does.
[02:43:56.926 --> 02:43:59.128]  There are a number of us that are doing it.
[02:43:59.128 --> 02:44:02.550]  It's bringing it all together to make it happen.
[02:44:02.550 --> 02:44:07.273]  Because when you look at the clowns that are telling us what to do, how to think.
[02:44:07.273 --> 02:44:09.975]  Hey, what a wonderful 4th of July, huh Alex?
[02:44:09.975 --> 02:44:12.457]  Did you hunt down any terrorists?
[02:44:12.457 --> 02:44:14.719]  Did you keep an eye out open there?
[02:44:14.719 --> 02:44:18.221]  You know, if you see something, say something.
[02:44:18.221 --> 02:44:21.904]  How many times have they done this since 9-11?
[02:44:21.904 --> 02:44:24.926]  What is this, about the 30th time of an alert?
[02:44:25.186 --> 02:44:28.387]  And they roll out little clowns like that guy King.
[02:44:28.387 --> 02:44:30.207]  King, how about Dwarf?
[02:44:30.207 --> 02:44:35.549]  Because that's who he is, that representative over here in New York.
[02:44:35.549 --> 02:44:39.090]  Fear and hysteria, that's all they know how to sell.
[02:44:39.090 --> 02:44:45.632]  Matter of fact, I spent the whole weekend up here in the Catskill Mountains going through brush, looking for terrorists.
[02:44:45.632 --> 02:44:48.553]  When were they going to pop out of the woods?
[02:44:48.553 --> 02:44:49.573]  And they keep doing it.
[02:44:52.386 --> 02:45:07.357]  I want to go to some phone calls, but what do you make of the governor of New Jersey saying there's a terror attack Rand Paul is to blame when he tried to stop our government funding the radical Islamists that have now turned into ISIS?
[02:45:07.357 --> 02:45:11.240]  What would I make of Laurel or Hardy?
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:17.725]  What would I make with a stupid clown of a man shooting off his fat mouth about nothing?
[02:45:19.224 --> 02:45:26.157]  I can't stand these guys that talk tough and can't fight their way out of a paper bag.
[02:45:26.157 --> 02:45:28.421]  And they've made bags a lot thinner now.
[02:45:29.113 --> 02:45:36.936]  This guy is such a brave guy with all his flunkies around him, putting down nothing.
[02:45:36.936 --> 02:45:39.377]  He's a total loser.
[02:45:39.377 --> 02:45:43.559]  Why would anybody look at the whole clown show?
[02:45:43.559 --> 02:45:46.880]  As we call it, the presidential reality show.
[02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:48.221]  That's all it is.
[02:45:49.281 --> 02:45:52.183]  He has a chance of winning from nothing.
[02:45:52.183 --> 02:45:53.824]  And you know what they're doing?
[02:45:53.824 --> 02:45:57.326]  They want either maybe a game show for Christie.
[02:45:57.326 --> 02:45:59.167]  He'd be great!
[02:45:59.167 --> 02:46:02.669]  Oh yeah, I could see him dressed up as Bozo!
[02:46:02.669 --> 02:46:04.230]  He can work at SeaWorld.
[02:46:04.230 --> 02:46:05.871]  He can work at SeaWorld as a trained seal.
[02:46:08.069 --> 02:46:09.290]  So that's all it is.
[02:46:09.290 --> 02:46:14.093]  Of course, what they're trying to do is rob us of our rights.
[02:46:14.093 --> 02:46:17.716]  Why would anybody listen to any of them?
[02:46:17.716 --> 02:46:21.178]  So, again, what a loser this clown is.
[02:46:21.178 --> 02:46:23.520]  And he's doing it for his own ego.
[02:46:23.520 --> 02:46:27.523]  As I said, maybe a book deal, maybe a TV show.
[02:46:27.523 --> 02:46:34.688]  But I think SeaWorld would be great because he could also, you know, they could feed the whale or feed him.
[02:46:34.688 --> 02:46:35.869]  It's going to look the same.
[02:46:39.890 --> 02:46:45.136]  Oh man, when I say I get depressed, actually a lot of good things are happening.
[02:46:45.136 --> 02:46:45.696]  It's just...
[02:46:46.889 --> 02:47:00.576]  Crazy how they turn around that Greece deserves all this and the media acts like it's no big deal as they prepare to grab private money out of bank accounts that's after taxes to give it to foreign banks.
[02:47:00.576 --> 02:47:07.780]  I mean this is global government under the banksters and you know it's all coming here and their war on cash Gerald.
[02:47:07.780 --> 02:47:12.302]  They're getting it already and I think that's it that I want to expose them faster.
[02:47:13.561 --> 02:47:15.984]  Because you can clearly see they're about to drop the hammer.
[02:47:15.984 --> 02:47:18.868]  I mean, they're getting ready for something big, Gerald.
[02:47:18.868 --> 02:47:22.172]  You know, people ask me, you know, what about gold and silver?
[02:47:22.172 --> 02:47:25.676]  And I always make it very clear, I do not give financial advice.
[02:47:26.667 --> 02:47:29.469]  Why would you not want to have gold and silver now?
[02:47:29.469 --> 02:47:31.991]  Suppose you lived in Greece.
[02:47:31.991 --> 02:47:38.255]  And by the way, from the reports I'm reading, gold sales are going up very strongly over there.
[02:47:38.255 --> 02:47:48.462]  So when they go to this, as you mentioned, a paperless currency of just digital money backed by nothing and printed in thin air,
[02:47:49.663 --> 02:47:56.525]  I believe that the next spike in gold prices and silver prices are going to be exactly that.
[02:47:56.525 --> 02:48:01.767]  You're going to start seeing them run up when the next crisis has happened.
[02:48:01.767 --> 02:48:03.187]  The panic is on.
[02:48:03.187 --> 02:48:08.329]  Again, how can anybody in their right mind, living in Greece, have money in the bank?
[02:48:08.889 --> 02:48:27.737]  And you've heard me say many times the stories that have happened to me, and of course you well know the MF Global story, and MF is the perfect initials of the guy Corzine who stole my money out of my segregated account when I used to buy gold through MF Global.
[02:48:27.737 --> 02:48:32.799]  So what I'm saying is, why wouldn't people prepare for the worst?
[02:48:32.799 --> 02:48:37.881]  Because if you prepare for the worst, and the worst doesn't happen, you've lost nothing.
[02:48:38.621 --> 02:48:42.824]  But if you don't prepare, and the worst occurs, you lose everything.
[02:48:42.824 --> 02:48:45.306]  All right, we're going to go to Joe, and then we're going to go to Jeff.
[02:48:45.306 --> 02:48:47.387]  Everybody, they're such troopers.
[02:48:47.387 --> 02:48:52.050]  For holding, I'm going to get their address and send them a free t-shirt of their size.
[02:48:52.050 --> 02:48:56.634]  We got 10% off this month, by the way, on all the t-shirts, including all the Made in America ones.
[02:48:56.634 --> 02:48:58.455]  I didn't mean to turn that into a plug, but I just did.
[02:48:58.455 --> 02:49:04.219]  So we're going to give Joe, Jeff, Wildman, Joshua, and Rich all free t-shirts for holding so long.
[02:49:04.219 --> 02:49:05.100]  But before I do that,
[02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:09.401]  We're going to play a video to give Chris Christie some free time.
[02:49:09.401 --> 02:49:11.322]  It turns out I was wrong and I apologize.
[02:49:11.322 --> 02:49:12.982]  He already works at SeaWorld.
[02:49:12.982 --> 02:49:16.123]  Here's an exclusive video of his first day at SeaWorld.
[02:49:16.123 --> 02:49:17.764]  Here it is.
[02:49:17.764 --> 02:49:22.145]  Go.
[02:49:22.145 --> 02:49:30.287]  And hey, he's a big hit.
[02:49:30.287 --> 02:49:33.748]  Let's go ahead and go to Joe in Pennsylvania.
[02:49:33.748 --> 02:49:34.709]  You're on the air.
[02:49:34.709 --> 02:49:34.989]  Thanks.
[02:49:35.984 --> 02:49:37.746]  Hey Alex, how you doing guys?
[02:49:37.746 --> 02:49:38.927]  Alright brother, thanks for holding.
[02:49:38.927 --> 02:49:39.828]  Go ahead.
[02:49:39.828 --> 02:49:40.668]  No worries.
[02:49:40.668 --> 02:49:42.130]  You ain't got to send me nothing for free.
[02:49:42.130 --> 02:49:43.891]  I want to do it!
[02:49:43.891 --> 02:49:47.615]  I'm sending everybody that's been holding for an hour a free t-shirt.
[02:49:47.615 --> 02:49:48.535]  Go ahead.
[02:49:48.535 --> 02:49:56.363]  Well, I'm glad I waited because there were so many things that you guys were talking about that just, they come together with what I'm saying there.
[02:49:56.363 --> 02:49:59.826]  And this whole thing with Greece, when they defaulted last week,
[02:50:00.718 --> 02:50:06.140]  And of course it was right after the markets closed and then next thing Puerto Rico went, I'm physically sick.
[02:50:06.140 --> 02:50:13.582]  You got every right to be depressed, but we are all, you know, whether it's big guy or little guy, we're all trying to wake people up.
[02:50:13.582 --> 02:50:16.503]  We're depressed, but we're trying to wake people up.
[02:50:16.503 --> 02:50:20.465]  Um, but this is what you were all that crazy.
[02:50:20.465 --> 02:50:27.007]  Um, there was a, I don't know if you guys ever heard of, uh, Lawrence, uh, Dunigan or, uh, Dr. Day.
[02:50:28.800 --> 02:50:37.905]  It was an interview done back in 1969, and it was recently put out in three parts audio.
[02:50:37.905 --> 02:50:53.034]  Two parts were in 1988, one was in 1999, and they laid out everything that was going to happen from 1969, the audio came out in 1991, and you said something that sent chills down my spine because you said something big is going to happen.
[02:50:53.829 --> 02:50:59.131]  You just recently said that, just now, and a while back you said you think it's going to happen in winter.
[02:50:59.131 --> 02:51:06.173]  And they said, everything, 98% of what they said was going to happen, or that's going on today, they said, you know, it's already happening.
[02:51:06.173 --> 02:51:14.996]  But anyway, the thing that really freaked me out was when you said, you're expecting something to happen in winter.
[02:51:14.996 --> 02:51:23.119]  And what the guy said was, probably what's going to happen is the big dissenters, they're going to do something during the winter, probably on a Friday,
[02:51:23.775 --> 02:51:32.981]  Get everybody out, take them out, and come Monday, everybody would be accustomed to the New World Order, and they'd get them all accustomed to it over the weekend.
[02:51:32.981 --> 02:51:39.966]  And basically, a big puzzle's been thrown out over the past, you know, 60, 100 years.
[02:51:39.966 --> 02:51:42.107]  The pieces have been put together.
[02:51:42.107 --> 02:51:43.048]  We're getting a picture.
[02:51:43.048 --> 02:51:44.509]  We see the picture.
[02:51:44.509 --> 02:51:50.613]  And unfortunately, I hope it doesn't get down to the last piece being put together, and finally people go, there it is.
[02:51:50.613 --> 02:51:51.674]  But in my opinion,
[02:51:52.233 --> 02:51:55.314]  Greece is just a little tiny thing, like Mr. Salerno said.
[02:51:55.314 --> 02:51:59.895]  The GDP is not that big, but it's small.
[02:51:59.895 --> 02:52:01.055]  It's going to start small.
[02:52:01.055 --> 02:52:02.015]  It's going to escalate.
[02:52:02.015 --> 02:52:05.816]  It's a domino, and the domino effect is just going to tumble.
[02:52:05.816 --> 02:52:06.136]  Sure.
[02:52:06.136 --> 02:52:06.836]  Well, thank you, Joe.
[02:52:06.836 --> 02:52:07.376]  Go on hold.
[02:52:07.376 --> 02:52:16.138]  We're going to get your address, and your size, and we'll send you a free Second Amendment t-shirt from Infowars.com, or a 1776 shirt or something.
[02:52:20.327 --> 02:52:30.615]  What you're getting at is everybody feels it, you can intellectually, politically see it, and it's just a feeling of not wanting to see these countries collapse.
[02:52:30.615 --> 02:52:37.281]  The reason Greece is so important is that other countries in the Euro, or even in worse shape,
[02:52:38.380 --> 02:52:41.143]  And how far will this go?
[02:52:41.143 --> 02:52:43.204]  So that's why Greece is a big deal.
[02:52:43.204 --> 02:52:45.246]  The whole house of cards is untenable.
[02:52:45.246 --> 02:52:48.989]  Do you want to respond to anything Joe said, Gerald Salente?
[02:52:48.989 --> 02:52:50.070]  He really summed it up.
[02:52:50.070 --> 02:52:51.471]  It's a domino effect.
[02:52:51.471 --> 02:52:52.893]  And it starts small and again.
[02:52:54.073 --> 02:52:55.954]  It's what Samuel Adams said.
[02:52:55.954 --> 02:52:59.816]  It doesn't take a majority to prevail.
[02:52:59.816 --> 02:53:05.119]  A small set of instances are the ones that make it all happen.
[02:53:05.119 --> 02:53:09.662]  And again, what they did with direct democracy, by letting the people vote,
[02:53:10.222 --> 02:53:12.705]  You know, that's the way I believe it should be.
[02:53:12.705 --> 02:53:16.509]  You pointed out, you know, we have a lot of people that would vote the other way.
[02:53:16.509 --> 02:53:24.038]  But again, putting it all into context, as we have it now, you know, we don't have a representative form of government.
[02:53:25.299 --> 02:53:26.020]  We're good to go.
[02:53:41.198 --> 02:53:43.520]  Because the people spoke.
[02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:57.151]  Rather than having a bunch of sellouts, liars, crooks, and thieves speaking for us, better known as congressmen and senators, I think direct democracy is the way to go.
[02:53:57.151 --> 02:53:58.472]  On big issues.
[02:53:58.472 --> 02:54:08.220]  Well, one thing's for sure, right now we have the globalists running however they want, and as you said, if you look at Iceland and other countries, they've signed these nations on
[02:54:09.568 --> 02:54:13.549]  To the derivatives debt, almost all the debt is not the nation states.
[02:54:13.549 --> 02:54:19.411]  And they knew years ago when they passed austerity and raised all these taxes it would reduce GDP.
[02:54:19.411 --> 02:54:27.653]  That was the point Dr. Roberts, you, Ron Paul, countless others made here on the air was that it was meant to depress it so they couldn't pay it back.
[02:54:27.653 --> 02:54:30.554]  And the last straw was when they called for a huge new
[02:54:31.594 --> 02:54:35.302]  Increase in value-added tax on all tourism.
[02:54:35.302 --> 02:54:37.466]  Well, that's all that country's got now.
[02:54:37.466 --> 02:54:38.448]  They're not stupid.
[02:54:38.448 --> 02:54:39.951]  They've seen their GDP shrink.
[02:54:40.905 --> 02:54:42.466]  And they understand what's going on.
[02:54:42.466 --> 02:54:47.210]  They understand they're being imploded and being maneuvered towards total bankruptcy.
[02:54:47.210 --> 02:54:52.734]  So why pay something back that isn't your debt and that's impossible to pay back?
[02:54:52.734 --> 02:54:56.437]  I think Greece has had a moment of sanity.
[02:54:56.437 --> 02:54:58.238]  Jeff in California, thanks for holding.
[02:54:58.238 --> 02:55:02.942]  You're on the air with Gerald Cilente from TrendsResearch.com.
[02:55:02.942 --> 02:55:07.886]  Hey guys, you know, Cilente Jones, 2016, that would be great.
[02:55:08.765 --> 02:55:14.049]  You know, the White Shoe Boys, as Gerald calls them, are running the wrecking ball.
[02:55:14.049 --> 02:55:16.651]  And, you know, they're wrecking everything.
[02:55:16.651 --> 02:55:20.373]  You know, I talk to this about people that, you know, I live in Southern California.
[02:55:20.373 --> 02:55:27.559]  I'm surrounded by people that, like you say, Alex can't wipe their own hind-ends.
[02:55:27.559 --> 02:55:30.100]  People say, well, you know, it's not that bad and everything.
[02:55:31.661 --> 02:55:33.001]  It is bad.
[02:55:33.001 --> 02:55:35.922]  They're wrecking and destroying everything.
[02:55:35.922 --> 02:55:37.523]  And by the way, we're not joking.
[02:55:37.523 --> 02:55:40.783]  The average trendy, my dog is smarter than them.
[02:55:40.783 --> 02:55:42.404]  I mean, and Gerald's right.
[02:55:42.404 --> 02:55:47.445]  It takes a minority, either evil or good, to fix things or to take over, vice versa.
[02:55:47.445 --> 02:55:55.027]  But how do you deal with a mass of people juxtaposed by super hardworking great men and women of every race, color, and creed,
[02:55:56.537 --> 02:56:00.541]  And I hate to give into this cliche that immigrants want to work harder and are better.
[02:56:00.541 --> 02:56:06.946]  The smart ones do know about the Federal Reserve and the New World Order and do want to work.
[02:56:06.946 --> 02:56:11.871]  The problem is our government advertises for lazy immigrants to come in and go on welfare.
[02:56:11.871 --> 02:56:13.292]  I'm sorry, I'm ranting.
[02:56:13.292 --> 02:56:14.833]  It's just, Gerald, what do we do?
[02:56:14.833 --> 02:56:16.215]  Then I want to call her to finish.
[02:56:16.215 --> 02:56:19.878]  About the mass of just, have you seen the Mark Dice videos in ours?
[02:56:19.878 --> 02:56:23.161]  Where 8 out of 10 people don't know what the 4th of July is?
[02:56:24.332 --> 02:56:25.253]  Yeah.
[02:56:25.253 --> 02:56:27.294]  I mean, who are these people?
[02:56:27.294 --> 02:56:31.636]  Again, they will go anywhere.
[02:56:31.636 --> 02:56:35.738]  They'll follow whatever the trend is of the time.
[02:56:35.738 --> 02:56:40.541]  So what it takes is for more of us to be out in the forefront.
[02:56:40.541 --> 02:56:45.364]  They'll gladly join in because they're only getting one message.
[02:56:46.058 --> 02:56:50.740]  Because the change, though, again, it's underway.
[02:56:50.740 --> 02:56:55.502]  And as the first caller said, you know, the dominoes are falling.
[02:56:55.502 --> 02:57:02.025]  They don't count in a lot of ways in the sense that they're not going to be activists in any way.
[02:57:02.025 --> 02:57:04.146]  They'll go wherever the flow goes.
[02:57:04.326 --> 02:57:04.706]  You're right.
[02:57:04.706 --> 02:57:05.026]  You're right.
[02:57:05.026 --> 02:57:07.607]  In fact, that's what I was told by a big Hollywood producer.
[02:57:07.607 --> 02:57:10.708]  He goes, Alex, quit getting sad that people are so dumb on average.
[02:57:10.708 --> 02:57:13.948]  He goes, that just means good people can lead them even easier.
[02:57:13.948 --> 02:57:19.330]  You just have to get out there and lead them and be a leader and stop worrying about how dumb they are.
[02:57:19.330 --> 02:57:21.150]  You know, that's just sadly the way they were brought up.
[02:57:21.150 --> 02:57:25.331]  And they'll get smarter in the process once they get hurt.
[02:57:25.331 --> 02:57:28.012]  Precisely.
[02:57:28.012 --> 02:57:28.652]  I'm sorry, Jeff.
[02:57:28.652 --> 02:57:28.972]  Go ahead.
[02:57:30.287 --> 02:57:33.268]  You know, years ago I was part of an organization.
[02:57:33.268 --> 02:57:39.230]  I sent about over 350 letters to the White House and Congress and so on, you know, regarding immigration.
[02:57:39.230 --> 02:57:42.451]  And then I realized that they don't want to fix it.
[02:57:42.451 --> 02:57:43.371]  They didn't want to fix it.
[02:57:43.371 --> 02:57:49.133]  I mean, this is all by design to destroy the old America any way they possibly can.
[02:57:49.133 --> 02:57:52.894]  Destroy the family, destroy our culture, you know, in every different way.
[02:57:53.732 --> 02:57:56.193]  And, you know, they do have a plan.
[02:57:56.193 --> 02:57:58.775]  You talk about it, Alex, it's global governance.
[02:57:58.775 --> 02:58:01.056]  And so they need to wreck everything.
[02:58:01.056 --> 02:58:14.104]  And it's frustrating because, you know, I'm surrounded by people that are being fed from, you know, these people on television and their favorite, you know, I mean, right now it's women's soccer and, you know, everybody's going crazy.
[02:58:15.166 --> 02:58:20.889]  Meanwhile, they're completely wrecking the world and wrecking the country, and nobody seems to care.
[02:58:20.889 --> 02:58:24.550]  I mean, a lot of people do, but, you know, I'd wear my bumper stickers.
[02:58:24.550 --> 02:58:27.372]  I refuse to... No, no, I hear you, brother.
[02:58:27.372 --> 02:58:29.813]  We're going to do five minutes overdrive if Gerald can do it.
[02:58:29.813 --> 02:58:33.154]  Gerald Celente, TrendsResearch.com, Alex Jones.
[02:58:33.154 --> 02:58:36.216]  Again, but like Gerald said, that was great advice.
[02:58:36.216 --> 02:58:40.938]  We've just got to keep getting the word out, because as stuff gets darker, the light's going to stand out.
[02:58:40.938 --> 02:58:41.358]  Stay with us.
[02:58:42.938 --> 02:58:48.704]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:48.704 --> 02:58:57.813]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:58:57.813 --> 02:59:05.921]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:06.201 --> 02:59:11.062]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:11.062 --> 02:59:17.864]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:17.864 --> 02:59:25.046]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:59:25.046 --> 02:59:31.888]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:59:32.048 --> 02:59:36.530]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:59:36.530 --> 02:59:39.931]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:59:39.931 --> 02:59:46.233]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:59:46.233 --> 02:59:50.895]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:50.895 --> 02:59:53.476]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.508 --> 03:00:08.130]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:08.130 --> 03:00:13.171]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:13.171 --> 03:00:23.053]  Our frustration is we've been partially conquered by special interest offshore banks.
[03:00:24.605 --> 03:00:30.470]  And those of us that are informed, it's just so obvious, and we're frustrated with the mass of dumbed down people.
[03:00:30.470 --> 03:00:37.495]  But that's probably only 30-40% of the public that I guess were raised in front of a television set.
[03:00:37.495 --> 03:00:41.619]  There's a large segment that's starting to wake up, all the numbers show that.
[03:00:41.619 --> 03:00:50.046]  And so I don't want to be too negative today, just sometimes I get upset, and I'm probably not good for the cause overall, and I'm not, when I get in that mode,
[03:00:51.195 --> 03:00:56.016]  And I'm not trying to cheerlead either and be over positive.
[03:00:56.016 --> 03:00:59.197]  I think Gerald Salente is absolutely right.
[03:00:59.197 --> 03:01:02.778]  We have never had a better time to wake people up.
[03:01:02.778 --> 03:01:10.340]  Gerald, before we go to Rich and a few other callers, can you speak briefly to why you think things are optimistic?
[03:01:11.601 --> 03:01:13.722]  Yeah, because the vacuum is so large.
[03:01:13.722 --> 03:01:16.243]  I mean, there was a study that just came out.
[03:01:16.243 --> 03:01:21.305]  It's like 70% of the people don't trust the major media anymore.
[03:01:21.305 --> 03:01:28.427]  You look at the numbers on how people are so disillusioned with the presidential reality show.
[03:01:28.427 --> 03:01:31.668]  And you pointed out you could fill the vacuum with anything.
[03:01:31.668 --> 03:01:35.950]  It could be a minority could make it worse, or a minority could make it better.
[03:01:36.610 --> 03:01:42.653]  You know, I'd like to pick up on what Jeff just said and what you were talking about with immigration.
[03:01:42.653 --> 03:01:45.654]  This is from my book, Trends 2000, that I wrote back in 1996.
[03:01:48.140 --> 03:02:04.203]  A University of California study showed that roughly one-fifth of the growth in the wage gap between the skilled and unskilled since the mid-1970s was linked to the growing supply of unskilled immigration labor.
[03:02:04.203 --> 03:02:14.704]  Immigration was costing the chiefly affected states, New York, Florida, Texas, Illinois, and California, an estimated $8 billion a year in services.
[03:02:14.704 --> 03:02:17.045]  So there you go.
[03:02:18.151 --> 03:02:28.557]  This whole immigration thing, it began with the National Association of Manufacturers, now we don't have any of that, much of it anymore, bringing in cheap labor.
[03:02:28.557 --> 03:02:36.482]  Then it was pushed with these H-1B visas by the Silicon Con men over there that wanted cheap labor coming in.
[03:02:36.482 --> 03:02:38.663]  And now you're seeing it across the board.
[03:02:38.663 --> 03:02:43.866]  It's doctors, it's everything that you could find, they're bringing in more and more cheap labor.
[03:02:44.386 --> 03:02:46.588]  I told you I just came back from Europe.
[03:02:46.588 --> 03:02:54.316]  The greatest trend that everybody should be watching, here we call it immigration, there they're calling it migration.
[03:02:54.316 --> 03:03:03.526]  You take a hundred thousand years ago to now, to 1900 rather, it took that time to put 1.6 billion people on the planet.
[03:03:03.526 --> 03:03:07.209]  From 1900 to now, we've added essentially six
[03:03:07.850 --> 03:03:09.471]  Billion people.
[03:03:09.471 --> 03:03:13.832]  They're flooding into Europe, and no one's talking about the cause.
[03:03:13.832 --> 03:03:15.773]  Why are they flooding out of Libya?
[03:03:15.773 --> 03:03:21.155]  Hey, it could be because of Hitler, Clinton, Obama, Samantha Powers, Susan Rice.
[03:03:21.155 --> 03:03:27.518]  Well that's the, in a sick way, we are to blame, because we allowed our leaders to literally destabilize all those areas.
[03:03:28.178 --> 03:03:28.819]  Exactly.
[03:03:28.819 --> 03:03:38.606]  So they're coming in from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, they're coming in from Sudan, they're coming in from Somalia, they're coming in from... Hey, how about those French going into Mali, huh?
[03:03:38.606 --> 03:03:40.367]  How about destroying that?
[03:03:40.367 --> 03:03:41.628]  Let me stop you for a minute.
[03:03:41.628 --> 03:03:43.630]  We gotta end the show, and I'm sorry to the other callers.
[03:03:43.630 --> 03:03:45.691]  Free t-shirt, everybody, holding.
[03:03:45.691 --> 03:03:47.453]  Gerald Cilenti, I want to give you the final comment, but...
[03:03:48.712 --> 03:03:56.101]  As you're saying all this, and I'm reading the same stuff, I follow it, you travel the world, the people running things couldn't do a worse job.
[03:03:56.101 --> 03:03:58.083]  I mean, but then I realized they like it.
[03:03:58.083 --> 03:04:05.592]  They love this because they always pose as the saviors and grab more power out of each crisis.
[03:04:05.592 --> 03:04:06.393]  Where does it end?
[03:04:07.990 --> 03:04:17.914]  It ends with we the people, and that's what you were talking about before, about the things that we're trying to do and you're trying to do to make it happen.
[03:04:17.914 --> 03:04:20.935]  And we could have peace and prosperity.
[03:04:20.935 --> 03:04:23.116]  We still have what it takes.
[03:04:23.116 --> 03:04:26.158]  We just have a bunch of losers running this show.
[03:04:26.158 --> 03:04:31.460]  If any of these guys worked in a business like yours, mine, or any major business, they'd be out of business.
[03:04:34.453 --> 03:04:35.254]  Are you involved?
[03:04:35.254 --> 03:04:38.918]  I know you're really promoting this direct democracy stuff to counter all this.
[03:04:38.918 --> 03:04:39.778]  Are you involved?
[03:04:39.778 --> 03:04:40.960]  And you know what?
[03:04:40.960 --> 03:04:43.762]  We need to get you back very soon to talk about some of the events you come up.
[03:04:43.762 --> 03:04:46.044]  And I also need to give you a call to talk about that.
[03:04:46.044 --> 03:04:47.185]  Gerald, thank you so much.
[03:04:47.185 --> 03:04:48.847]  TrendsResearch.com.
[03:04:48.847 --> 03:04:49.988]  And thanks for cheering me up.
[03:04:49.988 --> 03:04:51.129]  You're awesome.
[03:04:51.129 --> 03:04:52.571]  And thanks for all you're doing, Alex.
[03:04:52.571 --> 03:04:53.571]  And thanks for having me on.
[03:04:53.571 --> 03:04:54.012]  You're awesome.
[03:04:54.012 --> 03:04:54.733]  He did cheer me up.
[03:04:54.733 --> 03:04:55.573]  I'm in a good mood now.
[03:04:55.573 --> 03:04:56.815]  So I hope he did that for everybody else.
