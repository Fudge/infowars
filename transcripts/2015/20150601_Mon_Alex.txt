[00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.236]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.236 --> 00:00:11.838]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:13.380]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.565]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:21.629]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.431]  Ladies and gentlemen, I just had to double-take.
[00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:41.131]  I can't believe it.
[00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:46.453]  It's already June 1st, 2015 on this Worldwide Monday Edition.
[00:00:46.453 --> 00:00:48.933]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:52.254]  We have several extremely informative guests joining us today.
[00:00:52.254 --> 00:00:59.736]  We're going to be looking at the aftermath of the amazing speech that Rand Paul gave yesterday.
[00:00:59.736 --> 00:01:04.998]  He's now become GOP enemy number one for actually being a constitutionalist.
[00:01:06.294 --> 00:01:11.197]  He's come out and said that his opponents, quote, secretly want terror attacks so they can blame it on me.
[00:01:11.197 --> 00:01:18.582]  That clip's coming up after the break, but first, here's a segment where he really laid it all out from C-SPAN yesterday.
[00:01:18.582 --> 00:01:22.285]  Let us be very clear while we're here this evening.
[00:01:22.285 --> 00:01:26.027]  We are here this evening because this is an important debate.
[00:01:26.027 --> 00:01:28.809]  This is a debate over the Bill of Rights.
[00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:31.731]  This is a debate over the Fourth Amendment.
[00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:35.414]  This is a debate over your right to be left alone.
[00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:44.549]  Justice Brandeis said that the right to be left alone is the most cherished of rights.
[00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.872]  The right to be left alone is the most prized to civilized men.
[00:01:51.872 --> 00:02:00.755]  Let us be clear, we are here tonight because the president continues to conduct an illegal program.
[00:02:00.755 --> 00:02:01.576]  Sensational.
[00:02:01.576 --> 00:02:04.357]  The president has been rebuked by the court.
[00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:12.681]  The President has been told in no... We're going to come back after the break and air a full five, six minute piece.
[00:02:12.681 --> 00:02:24.424]  Then we're going to air the clip of where Rand Paul, Senator from Kentucky, talks about the fact that they hope there's a terror attack so he can be blamed.
[00:02:24.424 --> 00:02:33.446]  The fact that no other Republican has the guts to do what he's doing shows you really how controlled both political parties are.
[00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:36.958]  Where are the Democrats?
[00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.340]  Where are the Republicans?
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:47.204]  Well, they're being blackmailed because a bunch of them are criminals of different stripes.
[00:02:47.204 --> 00:02:52.807]  Probably the biggest contingent are pedophiles.
[00:02:52.807 --> 00:02:55.349]  And they're compromised.
[00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:04.194]  And here's Rand Paul with a wall of deceit across the media, including Republican right-wing establishment talking heads,
[00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:10.848]  Saying that he doesn't want to keep us safe and wants terrorists to attack us.
[00:03:10.848 --> 00:03:19.993]  Really, it's our rogue government that openly armed Al-Qaeda and ISIS in Syria, Libya, and other areas like Egypt.
[00:03:19.993 --> 00:03:22.275]  They're the ones that dissolved our borders.
[00:03:22.275 --> 00:03:30.980]  They're the ones using the Patriot Act and NSA against veterans, the Tea Party, libertarians, and conservatives.
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.863]  There's also this claim with Snowden now that we can finally all talk without being surveilled.
[00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:44.817]  There are several other Patriot Act-like laws that they've snuck through that basically, quote, authorize what's going on.
[00:03:44.817 --> 00:03:47.640]  But the body of it is illegal.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.223]  And they were doing it before they'd ever passed these laws.
[00:03:50.223 --> 00:03:53.087]  So believe this, it's still going on.
[00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:59.755]  Headline on Drudge, free to chat without NSA tracking, at least for now.
[00:03:59.755 --> 00:04:05.697]  And it's good to say that because then the public starts thinking about it and thinking about how laws affect this.
[00:04:05.697 --> 00:04:08.598]  And yes, you can technically go with what they say.
[00:04:08.598 --> 00:04:17.200]  Yes, we've stopped now recording everything, including your phone conversations, not just the quote metadata, who you called and when.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.141]  And boy, we're wide open to terror attack.
[00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:24.003]  But that itself is a lie.
[00:04:24.003 --> 00:04:25.203]  So we'll break it all down today.
[00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:38.019]  Up on Infowars.com, Rand Paul declares big victory for privacy.
[00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:41.080]  China fearless to fight war with U.S.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.341]  says their state media.
[00:04:43.341 --> 00:04:48.102]  Obama announces draconian unconstitutional gun rags by executive fiat.
[00:04:50.242 --> 00:04:52.525]  And a lot more coming up after this quick break.
[00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:56.310]  We'll look at the predicted housing crash that's coming.
[00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.711]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.485 --> 00:05:01.807]  Do you know what it means to be an American?
[00:05:01.807 --> 00:05:03.289]  It's more than a flag.
[00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.171]  It's more than knowing the star-spangled banner.
[00:05:06.171 --> 00:05:07.753]  It's knowing the Constitution.
[00:05:07.753 --> 00:05:10.836]  It's understanding those rights and fighting for them.
[00:05:10.836 --> 00:05:14.159]  Our country is falling apart because people have forgotten to fight.
[00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:17.662]  To stand up in the face of tyranny and do the right thing.
[00:05:17.662 --> 00:05:20.125]  It's putting your life on the line to protect your country.
[00:05:20.285 --> 00:05:21.105]  We're good to go.
[00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.713]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com, and I believe our flag is more than cloth and ink.
[00:05:41.713 --> 00:05:44.795]  It is a symbol that stands for liberty and freedom.
[00:05:44.795 --> 00:05:49.918]  It is a history of our nation, and it's marked by the blood of those who died defending it.
[00:05:49.918 --> 00:05:51.679]  So join me in this Infowar.
[00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:56.122]  Turn off your TV, put your Cheetos down, get off your butt and join the resistance.
[00:05:59.657 --> 00:06:06.864]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:06:59.406 --> 00:07:00.666]  Another major health threat.
[00:07:00.666 --> 00:07:05.648]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:07:05.648 --> 00:07:08.309]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:15.371]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:07:15.371 --> 00:07:18.372]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:07:18.372 --> 00:07:21.313]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:07:21.313 --> 00:07:23.313]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:07:23.313 --> 00:07:26.174]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:07:26.254 --> 00:07:31.976]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:07:31.976 --> 00:07:35.498]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:07:35.498 --> 00:07:38.579]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:45.902]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[00:07:55.526 --> 00:07:56.046]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:56.046 --> 00:08:00.808]  You can complain about Big Brother and how this is a potential program run amok.
[00:08:14.011 --> 00:08:18.074]  But when you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance.
[00:08:18.074 --> 00:08:34.968]  And if people can't trust not only the executive branch, but also don't trust Congress and don't trust federal judges to make sure that we're abiding by the Constitution, due process and rule of law, then we're going to have some problems here.
[00:08:34.968 --> 00:08:37.109]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:37.109 --> 00:08:38.611]  Because there is a war on.
[00:08:38.611 --> 00:08:39.952]  For your mind.
[00:08:43.757 --> 00:08:56.747]  Of course, multiple federal courts have ruled that major provisions of the Patriot Act are unconstitutional, that NSA bulk data collection is illegal.
[00:08:56.747 --> 00:09:06.034]  But President Obama knows that his constituents are dumber than a box of hammers.
[00:09:06.034 --> 00:09:10.718]  Dumber than a bag of rocks.
[00:09:10.718 --> 00:09:12.399]  And so he can just sit up there and lie to everybody.
[00:09:13.883 --> 00:09:26.093]  Or say, oh my gosh, we're about to be hit by a terror attack because the Patriot Act elapsed last night at midnight, and Rand Paul, it's going to be his fault when terrorists attack us.
[00:09:27.711 --> 00:09:55.490]  When the federal government, working bipartisanly, has opened the southern border up, basically wide open, and pays to bring illegals in, and allows radicals to come in and then start organizing at major mosques, calling for terror attacks across the United States, and our own government has been arming ISIS and Al Qaeda all over the Middle East to topple secular governments and destabilize the region, and even Judicial Watch last week
[00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.853]  Got the defense intelligence documents from two years ago.
[00:09:59.853 --> 00:10:07.559]  Where the Pentagon admitted its main directive was to arm Al-Qaeda by name!
[00:10:07.559 --> 00:10:10.181]  Along with Al-Nusra by name!
[00:10:10.181 --> 00:10:14.164]  And the Salafist by name!
[00:10:14.164 --> 00:10:16.886]  You wonder why our military has been speaking out?
[00:10:16.886 --> 00:10:23.651]  And why you've seen the thousands of photos of officers covering their faces with signs saying, I won't fight for Al-Qaeda?
[00:10:23.651 --> 00:10:25.373]  And why General Dempsey two years ago went
[00:10:27.327 --> 00:10:35.615]  On that Saturday night, on the eve of an attack on Syria, and told Obama the military is going to go mutinous.
[00:10:35.615 --> 00:10:37.036]  Well, it's not mutiny.
[00:10:37.036 --> 00:10:43.443]  We've got a rogue government that's illegitimate, engaging in public war crimes in our name.
[00:10:45.791 --> 00:10:51.713]  So anyone that gets up there and says that Rand Paul wants terror attacks to happen is a complete fraud.
[00:10:51.713 --> 00:10:53.594]  Rand Paul has said secure our border.
[00:10:53.594 --> 00:10:56.475]  By the way, people ask why I like Rand Paul the best of any of the candidates.
[00:10:56.475 --> 00:11:00.636]  It's not that I've known him for 20 years.
[00:11:00.636 --> 00:11:11.560]  I'm proud of the fact that I'm probably the first person to ever interview Rand Paul for political discussions.
[00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:22.577]  Back when his father was running in 1995-96, I'd just gotten my radio show, I'd just had Ron Paul on, and I said, well, who else could come on?
[00:11:22.577 --> 00:11:26.700]  This is such a close race, because back then his district came right up to South Austin.
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.222]  I was in his district at the time.
[00:11:29.222 --> 00:11:31.563]  And they said, gee, we don't know who you could have on.
[00:11:31.563 --> 00:11:35.085]  His campaign managers, you know, doing these interviews.
[00:11:35.085 --> 00:11:36.887]  And I said, well, who else is around?
[00:11:36.887 --> 00:11:38.508]  He goes, well, you could interview me.
[00:11:41.206 --> 00:11:42.227]  And I said, really, Rand?
[00:11:42.227 --> 00:11:43.267]  I didn't know.
[00:11:43.267 --> 00:11:44.848]  You didn't tell me you were his son.
[00:11:44.848 --> 00:11:47.930]  Yeah, no, I'm taking time off from my practice.
[00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:53.254]  I'm a doctor to help my dad.
[00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:54.855]  So I'm on the phone with Rand Paul.
[00:11:54.855 --> 00:11:57.817]  I said, well, yeah, you come on.
[00:11:57.817 --> 00:12:02.480]  That's a true story.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.902]  And I just know he's for real.
[00:12:04.902 --> 00:12:06.583]  But separating all of that
[00:12:07.799 --> 00:12:14.984]  He has separated himself from the pack by doing something that's bold.
[00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:16.324]  Stand up for the Constitution.
[00:12:16.324 --> 00:12:17.625]  Stand up for the Bill of Rights.
[00:12:17.625 --> 00:12:18.866]  Stand up for common sense.
[00:12:18.866 --> 00:12:26.271]  Call out the President and say what he's doing is illegal and treasonous on the Senate floor.
[00:12:26.271 --> 00:12:29.253]  And he's had the entire establishment come after him.
[00:12:29.253 --> 00:12:30.453]  Here are the headlines.
[00:12:30.453 --> 00:12:35.897]  Rand Paul, my opponent, secretly want terror attack so they can blame it on me.
[00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.833]  Video, Rand Paul speaks out against the Patriot Act.
[00:12:41.833 --> 00:12:44.915]  I don't think the American people are going to take it anymore.
[00:12:44.915 --> 00:12:47.537]  That's the type of talk that saves countries.
[00:12:47.537 --> 00:12:49.278]  Getting people out of their trance.
[00:12:49.278 --> 00:12:50.359]  Saying, don't take it anymore.
[00:12:50.359 --> 00:12:51.620]  We're in a crisis.
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:52.840]  This is outrageous.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:57.864]  They label all this tyranny, real milk dust.
[00:12:57.864 --> 00:13:02.207]  The Patriot Act just made Rand Paul GOP enemy number one.
[00:13:02.207 --> 00:13:03.048]  That's the headline.
[00:13:07.972 --> 00:13:13.173]  Meanwhile, Zombie Patriot Act will keep US spying, even if the original dies.
[00:13:13.173 --> 00:13:17.655]  That's right, we're gonna break it down.
[00:13:17.655 --> 00:13:22.996]  And some will ask, well, if they're still doing it, then what's the point?
[00:13:22.996 --> 00:13:28.718]  Because then we force them to do it illegally, and then there'll be more whistleblowers, and then the whole thing will implode.
[00:13:28.718 --> 00:13:35.880]  And it's coming out they're using the NSA to spy on Congress.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.720]  It's coming out
[00:13:41.966 --> 00:13:49.649]  It's coming out that all of this is being done and being deployed against the American people.
[00:13:49.649 --> 00:13:55.452]  And it's forcing the Daily Beast, Newsweek Magazine, to come out and admit
[00:13:56.547 --> 00:13:59.108]  That there are all these other illegal systems going on.
[00:13:59.108 --> 00:14:23.378]  Back when they thought we'd put up with anything, they had Admiral Poindexter, the head of the Total Information Awareness Network, that's the corporate private group with governmental power, over 800,000 private contractors domestically, merging all the spy agency data, which then allows total infiltration by foreign governments and corporate espionage, giving 800,000 private contractors access to basically all of it.
[00:14:25.987 --> 00:14:35.574]  And then putting in place a system, we should get William Binning on sometime this week just to give us his take on all this, former technical director of the NSA.
[00:14:35.574 --> 00:14:42.879]  Then having computer systems in place so no one can tell who accesses the network.
[00:14:42.879 --> 00:14:49.044]  Designing it so that we're wide open and our security is destroyed.
[00:14:49.044 --> 00:14:54.808]  Through a panopticonic, omnipresent, big brother on steroids system.
[00:14:56.767 --> 00:15:09.972]  And then selling it as Americana and then calling the man who's speaking out against it a traitor.
[00:15:09.972 --> 00:15:10.893]  So they're doing two things.
[00:15:10.893 --> 00:15:14.194]  They're going, oh, don't worry, the spy is continuing to keep you safe.
[00:15:14.194 --> 00:15:15.215]  Rand Paul failed.
[00:15:15.215 --> 00:15:16.215]  No, he didn't fail.
[00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:24.058]  He showed leadership and stood up against this technological takeover that's happening.
[00:15:24.058 --> 00:15:25.699]  This technocracy.
[00:15:29.557 --> 00:15:33.678]  And it shows how far we've sunk into tyranny.
[00:15:33.678 --> 00:15:36.079]  That it's radical.
[00:15:36.079 --> 00:15:38.379]  That it's over-the-top.
[00:15:38.379 --> 00:15:51.102]  That it's shocking that a senator would get up and say, we can't have illegal total spying recording everything the American people do in a free country.
[00:15:51.102 --> 00:15:54.283]  Everyone knows that's the antithesis of a free country.
[00:15:54.283 --> 00:15:58.024]  Everyone knows, they admit, they haven't stopped one terror attack with all this data.
[00:15:58.988 --> 00:16:00.850]  Because it's not even pointed at that.
[00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:09.237]  It's pointed at taking our freedoms, rigging markets, understanding globalist competition so they can shut it down.
[00:16:09.237 --> 00:16:13.320]  It's about cornering the global market in everything.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:19.025]  They've built, in the last seven years, five megacities.
[00:16:19.025 --> 00:16:25.791]  Huge, multi-hundred thousand square foot, per building,
[00:16:27.071 --> 00:16:37.134]  Some cases 8, 9, 10 buildings that are 100,000 square feet or more that are their own compact cities.
[00:16:37.134 --> 00:16:51.039]  Openly recording everything we do forever so they can data mine it and pull up an entire record of everything you've ever done whenever they want and it's all illegal and they have the nerve to get up on television.
[00:16:51.039 --> 00:16:52.620]  It takes a lot to shock me.
[00:16:53.638 --> 00:17:01.063]  My mouth was hitting the floor last night during the Sunday two-hour radio show we do every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:17:01.063 --> 00:17:09.370]  I went back in the break room, was getting a glass of water, and CNN was on.
[00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:11.091]  I think we even had the clip.
[00:17:12.912 --> 00:17:26.904]  And they had the host going along with the person they were interviewing, taking turns who could grovel to the Patriot Act and the NSA and Big Brother the most, and the host goes, all we're doing is following the Constitution.
[00:17:26.904 --> 00:17:30.687]  The Patriot Act is the Constitution, and Rand Paul is trying to destroy it.
[00:17:31.388 --> 00:17:39.372]  There is no spying, no one is being watched, none of it's true, it's a conspiracy theory, and now the terrorists are going to attack us.
[00:17:39.372 --> 00:17:43.795]  And then they cut to the guest, and they just basically agreed to everything they said.
[00:17:43.795 --> 00:17:54.140]  I mean, it was inverted reality, like when Senator Marco Rubio got up a few weeks ago and said, there is no NSA spying domestically, period.
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.181]  It does not exist.
[00:17:58.106 --> 00:18:10.271]  And you can keep your doctor if you like your doctor, and it'll cut your premiums, or it's gonna be free, and of course they admit now in a big article in Politico yesterday that there's massive increases right now.
[00:18:10.271 --> 00:18:16.173]  Huge, over-the-top increases across the board under Obamacare and premiums.
[00:18:16.173 --> 00:18:19.294]  On average, 50% a year.
[00:18:19.294 --> 00:18:20.835]  How's that for free?
[00:18:20.835 --> 00:18:23.816]  But see, they call it the Affordable Care Act, so it's okay.
[00:18:23.816 --> 00:18:25.377]  What do they call the new Patriot Act?
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.589]  A similarly sickening name.
[00:18:31.589 --> 00:18:39.283]  It'd be like throwing babies into wood chippers and the cops pull up and you go, I'm only engaging in take your child to work day.
[00:18:40.299 --> 00:18:50.190]  And I am a greenskeeper, a forester, and so I'm just running a woodchipper and I'm showing my child how at work is throwing a child into the woodchipper.
[00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:53.294]  I mean, this is the inversion of reality.
[00:18:53.294 --> 00:19:00.402]  Let's go ahead and go to Rand Paul talking about how they secretly want to blame terror attack on him.
[00:19:00.402 --> 00:19:00.783]  Here it is.
[00:19:01.394 --> 00:19:05.617]  People here in town think I'm making a huge mistake.
[00:19:05.617 --> 00:19:11.980]  Some of them, I think, secretly want there to be an attack on the United States so they can blame it on me.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:19.825]  One of the people in the media the other day came up to me and said, oh, well, when there's a great attack, aren't you going to feel guilty that you caused this great attack?
[00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:25.589]  And it's like, the people who attack us are responsible for attacks on us.
[00:19:25.589 --> 00:19:29.311]  Do we blame the police chief for the attack of the Boston bombers?
[00:19:30.501 --> 00:19:40.103]  The thing is, is that there can be attacks even if we use the Constitution, but there have been attacks while collecting your bulk data.
[00:19:40.103 --> 00:19:47.525]  So the ones who say, well, when an attack occurs it's going to be all your fault, are any of them willing to accept the blame?
[00:19:47.525 --> 00:19:49.145]  We have bulk collection now.
[00:19:49.145 --> 00:19:50.325]  That's right.
[00:19:50.325 --> 00:19:51.725]  Alright, we're going to come back.
[00:19:51.725 --> 00:19:56.626]  But again, the big issue is it's pointed at a political takeover of America.
[00:19:56.626 --> 00:19:58.707]  That's from William Binney and others that ran it.
[00:19:59.756 --> 00:20:05.978]  It's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the industry leader, My Patriot Supply.
[00:20:05.978 --> 00:20:12.140]  Once you try them, you'll know why so many Americans like you have made them part of their emergency preparedness plan.

[00:20:56.949 --> 00:20:57.809]  Don't wait.

[00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:04.391]  Alex Jones here with an InfoWarsLive.com consumer alert report.
[00:21:04.391 --> 00:21:09.693]  Many of you are aware that around the world, most populations are woefully deficient.
[00:21:11.715 --> 00:21:19.821]  The good news is, our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:28.828]  The bad news is, for the first time in more than a year, supplies at Infowarslife.com of survival shield X2 nascent iodine are running low.
[00:21:28.828 --> 00:21:33.612]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these deep earth crystals.
[00:21:33.612 --> 00:21:34.533]  That exclusive
[00:21:35.453 --> 00:21:44.096]  999 Pure Source is proprietary and only available to Infowarslife.com and that supply is running low and is in question.
[00:21:44.096 --> 00:21:51.079]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and long-time supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[00:21:51.079 --> 00:21:55.080]  Available exclusively at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:21:59.246 --> 00:22:03.690]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:08.554]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[00:22:08.554 --> 00:22:16.020]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease, and a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.921]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[00:22:18.921 --> 00:22:23.382]  I've taken whey protein products for years and I've never noticed results I have with your product.
[00:22:23.382 --> 00:22:26.582]  I've suffered with thoughts of constipation most of my life.
[00:22:26.582 --> 00:22:30.883]  Within a few days of taking One World Whey, I noticed a dramatic change.
[00:22:30.883 --> 00:22:34.804]  Also in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[00:22:34.804 --> 00:22:38.265]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[00:22:39.045 --> 00:22:40.566]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com
[00:22:58.331 --> 00:22:59.312]  Hey, Berkey Guy here.
[00:22:59.312 --> 00:23:01.133]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[00:23:01.133 --> 00:23:02.895]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[00:23:02.895 --> 00:23:04.856]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?
[00:23:04.856 --> 00:23:10.861]  The Berkey Guy is here to help you remove these and other potential contaminants from your water, thus helping you drink clean, purified water.

[00:23:19.588 --> 00:23:22.851]  Join them by visiting GoBerkey.com or call me, the Berkey Guy, at 877-886-3653.
[00:23:22.851 --> 00:23:23.051]  That's 877-886-3653.
[00:23:28.095 --> 00:23:30.817]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[00:23:30.817 --> 00:23:35.121]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[00:23:35.121 --> 00:23:36.522]  Silverlungs.com.
[00:23:36.522 --> 00:23:39.204]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[00:23:39.204 --> 00:23:42.187]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[00:23:42.187 --> 00:23:44.548]  The Silverlungs generator allows you to make your own.
[00:23:44.548 --> 00:23:46.450]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:52.014]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[00:23:52.014 --> 00:23:55.818]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[00:23:55.818 --> 00:23:57.319]  That's Silverlungs.com.
[00:24:10.188 --> 00:24:22.233]  The perception has been created, including by political figures that serve in this chamber, that the United States government is listening to your phone calls or going through your bills as a matter of course.
[00:24:22.233 --> 00:24:25.355]  That is absolutely categorically false.
[00:24:25.355 --> 00:24:31.978]  The next time that any politician, senator, congressman, talking head, whatever it may be, stands up and says that the U.S.
[00:24:31.978 --> 00:24:37.940]  government is listening to your phone calls or going through your phone records, they're lying.
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:38.761]  It just is not true.
[00:24:40.413 --> 00:24:50.417]  Except for some very isolated instances in the hundreds of individuals for whom there is reasonable suspicion that they could have links to terrorism.
[00:24:50.417 --> 00:24:58.680]  And that is absolute patented lies from all the NSA whistleblowers exposing it and what's admitted.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:06.283]  Remember the folks that weren't even Muslims in Florida that ordered some pressure cookers to cook seafood in and they got SWAT teamed?
[00:25:06.283 --> 00:25:08.884]  I mean, everything's being watched.
[00:25:11.032 --> 00:25:13.134]  Your location's being tracked by your phone.
[00:25:13.134 --> 00:25:15.096]  I'd tell people about that 20 years ago.
[00:25:15.096 --> 00:25:15.897]  They didn't believe it.
[00:25:15.897 --> 00:25:18.320]  Now it's all out in the open.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.946]  The head of the CIA, Petraeus, three years ago came out and admitted your appliances are watching you.
[00:25:23.946 --> 00:25:32.054]  Samsung, in their terms of conditions, says that the camera and microphone's listening to you and sending it to third parties.
[00:25:32.054 --> 00:25:33.576]  So, quote, watch what you say.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:42.424]  But they sit up there with the authority of the Senate in their fancy suits and lie to you.
[00:25:42.424 --> 00:25:45.207]  I mean, look at this Politico headline.
[00:25:45.207 --> 00:25:52.434]  USA Freedom Act versus USA Patriot Act.
[00:25:52.434 --> 00:25:58.080]  How about USA Lovey Flowers Act versus the USA Sweet Puppy Dog Act?
[00:26:00.444 --> 00:26:15.596]  How condescending, how insulting that it's an America, Republic killing, 180 degrees opposite from what we were founded on July 4th, 1776 at Independence Hall.
[00:26:15.596 --> 00:26:22.481]  The complete flip side, the complete inverse, the upside down, bizarro world of the scum.
[00:26:23.612 --> 00:26:32.323]  That came out four years ago and again this year when investigations got started and said Congress is allowed to insider trade, no one else is.
[00:26:32.323 --> 00:26:37.870]  We're allowed to own companies and then give them government contracts.
[00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:41.435]  Oh, it's okay that my wife, or in the case of Dianne Feinstein, her husband,
[00:26:43.855 --> 00:26:49.417]  Owns a multi-billion dollar biotech company that we're going to give billions of dollars of taxpayer money.
[00:26:49.417 --> 00:26:54.618]  There's nothing wrong with that, because we had a committee hearing and we voted on it and said it was okay.
[00:26:54.618 --> 00:26:59.920]  Hey, why don't you just go ahead and vote that it's okay that a bunch of you are pedophiles?
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.300]  See, you haven't gotten us there yet.
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.561]  Though you're trying.
[00:27:04.561 --> 00:27:07.502]  They're just a bunch of out-of-control con men and women.
[00:27:08.919 --> 00:27:10.720]  Harry Reid, all of them.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.701]  They're a bunch of hypocrite jokes.
[00:27:12.701 --> 00:27:17.044]  Like, when we cover this the next hour, all the new moves to get our guns.
[00:27:17.044 --> 00:27:18.405]  Obama promised executive action.
[00:27:18.405 --> 00:27:19.925]  Well, it was in Politico.
[00:27:19.925 --> 00:27:21.026]  It was in The Hill yesterday.
[00:27:21.026 --> 00:27:23.528]  We have an article, red-linked, on Infowars.com.
[00:27:23.528 --> 00:27:31.652]  They're coming to assault the gun owners, the gun shows, to ban the 556, the 223, to ban the variants of the rifles.
[00:27:31.652 --> 00:27:34.334]  They're coming!
[00:27:34.334 --> 00:27:35.895]  Just like they said they would, they're coming.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:46.644]  How about if they just ban all guns, all civilian ownership of firearms, and just call it the USA Freedom Act?
[00:27:46.644 --> 00:27:47.624]  I mean, come on!
[00:27:47.624 --> 00:27:48.304]  USA!
[00:27:48.304 --> 00:27:49.125]  Freedom!
[00:27:49.125 --> 00:27:50.345]  USA!
[00:27:50.345 --> 00:27:51.105]  USA!
[00:27:51.105 --> 00:27:52.366]  USA!
[00:27:52.366 --> 00:27:54.007]  Everything is wonderful!
[00:27:54.007 --> 00:27:55.207]  Everything is awesome!
[00:27:55.207 --> 00:27:56.648]  How about that free Obamacare?
[00:27:56.648 --> 00:27:57.988]  Oh, I'm sorry it cut your prices.
[00:27:57.988 --> 00:27:59.589]  Oh, I'm sorry it increased your prices.
[00:27:59.589 --> 00:28:01.290]  Oh, I'm sorry you couldn't keep your doctor.
[00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:06.612]  They lie, and they lie, and they lie, and they lie, and they lie.
[00:28:09.246 --> 00:28:10.747]  And they know you're awake on average.
[00:28:10.747 --> 00:28:16.269]  They know you don't buy what they're doing, but they just keep acting like everything's normal.
[00:28:16.269 --> 00:28:35.778]  As they put money in their Swiss bank accounts, as they buy houses overseas, as they get ready to flee the country, because they know when the housing bubble pops, and the banking money bubble pops, and when all the inflation starts hitting with depressionary cycles under it, with stag inflation, that you're going to be upset.
[00:28:42.725 --> 00:28:53.069]  Let's go back to Rand Paul, the clip we already played, and I'm going to come back with five minutes that we haven't gotten to yet, where he says his opponents secretly want terror attacks so they can blame it on him.
[00:28:53.069 --> 00:28:54.529]  Here it is.
[00:28:54.529 --> 00:28:58.771]  People here in town think I'm making a huge mistake.
[00:28:58.771 --> 00:29:03.713]  Some of them, I think, secretly want there to be an attack on the United States so they can blame it on me.
[00:29:05.134 --> 00:29:12.958]  One of the people in the media the other day came up to me and said, Oh, well, when there's a great attack, are you going to feel guilty that you caused this great attack?
[00:29:12.958 --> 00:29:17.661]  And it's like the people who attack us are responsible for attacks.
[00:29:17.661 --> 00:29:18.041]  Yeah.
[00:29:18.041 --> 00:29:24.345]  Since when was there this idea that we've got to preemptively take all your rights to keep you safe from an attack?
[00:29:24.345 --> 00:29:26.386]  And then you look at who the attackers are.
[00:29:26.386 --> 00:29:33.850]  It's a bunch of Saudi Arabians that are double agents with Western intelligence, with their idiot followers that they recruit.
[00:29:37.116 --> 00:29:38.377]  I mean, it's real simple.
[00:29:38.377 --> 00:29:44.884]  Criminals in our government are running radical Islam as a pretext to terrorize us into submission.
[00:29:44.884 --> 00:29:47.966]  Radical Islamics are the gun the globalists hold to our head.
[00:29:47.966 --> 00:29:48.907]  They're holding us hostage.
[00:29:48.907 --> 00:29:50.269]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:51.790]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:52.791]  Time to call their bluff.
[00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:55.474]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.622 --> 00:30:06.893]  The Pentagon admits it accidentally sent a shipment of live anthrax to as many as nine laboratories in the U.S.
[00:30:06.893 --> 00:30:08.695]  as well as a lab overseas.
[00:30:08.695 --> 00:30:14.945]  A CDC investigation of this mistake is underway and at the time there is no known risk to the general public.
[00:30:15.305 --> 00:30:26.575]  The anthrax samples were shipped from an army facility in Utah to government and commercial labs in Texas, Maryland, Wisconsin, Delaware, New Jersey, Tennessee, New York, California, and Virginia.
[00:30:26.575 --> 00:30:34.882]  The labs were working as part of a Pentagon effort to develop a new diagnostic test to identify biological threats in the environment.
[00:30:34.882 --> 00:30:42.008]  Dead or inactivated agents were expected, but one lab reports being able to grow live Bacillus anthraxus.
[00:30:42.268 --> 00:30:49.157]  The safety failure comes on the heels of increased scrutiny of bioterror agents and their oversight around the country.
[00:30:49.157 --> 00:30:56.386]  Last June, more than 80 people may have been exposed to live anthrax when a CDC lab sent it by mistake.
[00:30:56.386 --> 00:30:58.869]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:30:59.463 --> 00:31:04.626]  Alex Jones here with an InfoWarsLive.com Consumer Alert Report.
[00:31:04.626 --> 00:31:11.951]  Many of you are aware that around the world most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[00:31:11.951 --> 00:31:20.036]  The good news is our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:31:20.036 --> 00:31:21.037]  The bad news is
[00:31:21.357 --> 00:31:29.045]  For the first time in more than a year, supplies at InfoWarsLife.com of Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine are running low.
[00:31:29.045 --> 00:31:33.850]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these Deep Earth Crystals.
[00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:41.218]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary and only available to InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:31:41.218 --> 00:31:44.101]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[00:31:44.321 --> 00:31:51.311]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[00:31:51.311 --> 00:31:55.317]  Available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:31:59.249 --> 00:32:15.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.422]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[00:32:19.762 --> 00:32:23.665]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:32:23.665 --> 00:32:25.366]  Hdfirearms.com.
[00:32:25.366 --> 00:32:28.669]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:33.792]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[00:32:33.792 --> 00:32:37.735]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.

[00:32:40.117 --> 00:32:44.540]  Buy right off their website, and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice.
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.741]  You can pick it up at the gun show.
[00:32:45.981 --> 00:32:47.882]  You can pick it up at a local sporting goods store.
[00:32:47.882 --> 00:32:52.224]  Whatever you do, get your Head Down firearm today.
[00:32:52.224 --> 00:32:56.886]  The spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms.
[00:32:56.886 --> 00:33:04.069]  HDfirearms.com.
[00:33:04.069 --> 00:33:07.971]  It was easier to control a million people, literally.
[00:33:07.971 --> 00:33:14.454]  It was easier to control a million people than physically to kill a million people.
[00:33:15.979 --> 00:33:22.704]  Today, it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people.
[00:33:22.704 --> 00:33:31.991]  This is an emergency transmit.
[00:33:31.991 --> 00:33:34.933]  The Marine Six is occupied North America.
[00:33:34.933 --> 00:33:36.654]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:36.654 --> 00:33:38.216]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:45.101]  We're here, Monday through Friday, 11am to 2pm Central.
[00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:56.712]  Big Brother.
[00:33:56.712 --> 00:33:58.475]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:58.475 --> 00:34:00.257]  Government cover-ups.
[00:34:00.257 --> 00:34:01.839]  You want answers?
[00:34:01.839 --> 00:34:03.382]  Well, so does he.
[00:34:03.382 --> 00:34:07.568]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:34:07.568 --> 00:34:11.634]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:34:13.075 --> 00:34:14.536]  Let's make this a year of action.
[00:34:14.536 --> 00:34:15.977]  That's what most Americans want.
[00:34:15.977 --> 00:34:18.699]  Raising the debt ceiling does not increase our debt.
[00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:20.761]  Nobody is listening to your telephone calls.
[00:34:20.761 --> 00:34:22.102]  The debate is settled.
[00:34:22.102 --> 00:34:23.503]  Climate change is a fact.
[00:34:23.503 --> 00:34:32.329]  And if people can't trust not only the executive branch, but also don't trust Congress and don't trust federal judges, then we're gonna have some problems.
[00:34:32.329 --> 00:34:34.611]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:34:34.611 --> 00:34:35.692]  Let's try it.
[00:34:52.068 --> 00:34:52.468]  That's right.
[00:34:52.468 --> 00:34:54.329]  We're told that everything is awesome.
[00:34:54.329 --> 00:34:57.590]  We're told that everything is wonderful.
[00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:18.277]  And how dare one senator, out of what, 500 people in Congress, the House and Senate, 100 in the Senate, how dare one person stand up and say, why are we building giant cities all over the country of just huge buildings full of computers recording everything we do?
[00:35:19.724 --> 00:35:23.506]  And by the way, obsessing on what government does is only one part of the story.
[00:35:23.506 --> 00:35:24.767]  What about corporations?
[00:35:24.767 --> 00:35:27.029]  What about companies?
[00:35:27.029 --> 00:35:32.892]  What about the fact that a total control grid can be hacked and taken over?
[00:35:32.892 --> 00:35:40.898]  What about how the smart homes and smart cars can easily be hijacked?
[00:35:40.898 --> 00:35:43.459]  This is the real issue that we're discussing here today.
[00:35:43.459 --> 00:35:48.883]  It's a revolution by the technocrats to take over society.
[00:35:49.943 --> 00:35:51.203]  Look at these headlines.
[00:35:51.203 --> 00:35:56.425]  Senators flash anger at Paul and vice versa.
[00:35:56.425 --> 00:35:56.745]  U.S.
[00:35:56.745 --> 00:36:03.447]  lawmakers pile on as Rand Paul forces counter-terrorism lapse.
[00:36:03.447 --> 00:36:11.430]  The Patriot Act and the NSA on their own admissions have never stopped one terror attack in this country.
[00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:13.630]  You can pull that headline up from last week.
[00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:15.831]  It has nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.503]  Most terrorism is funded by the criminals that run this government and others.
[00:36:22.503 --> 00:36:26.465]  Doesn't mean our whole government, doesn't mean the military, doesn't mean the police.
[00:36:26.465 --> 00:36:32.448]  The media always spins that and says, you mean the cop down the street carried out 9-11 when you say government.
[00:36:32.448 --> 00:36:33.109]  No.
[00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:46.316]  Criminals running our government, bare minimum, opened the door, funded the terrorists and allowed them to attack, and then used that crisis to take American freedoms and point the biggest police state the world's ever seen at the American patriot.
[00:36:48.325 --> 00:36:55.629]  Now they say we've got to surveil you because domestic terror attacks are coming.
[00:36:55.629 --> 00:37:10.077]  And this is how far we've fallen, that it's seen as bizarre, that it's seen as weird to have a senator get up and say, we should have a debate about the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:37:10.077 --> 00:37:11.518]  Do we want to go 1984 or do we want to go 1776?
[00:37:17.082 --> 00:37:22.867]  And Paul said, I'm not going to take it anymore, and neither are the American people.
[00:37:22.867 --> 00:37:35.777]  And let's see if the American people really want freedom now, because if we want to be held hostage and told the big bad boogeyman's gonna kill us if we don't let the government take all our rights, well then we deserve what we get.
[00:37:35.777 --> 00:37:42.742]  I mean, come on folks, we know we don't get security by having a giant mega-sized government spying on every facet of our lives.
[00:37:42.742 --> 00:37:43.603]  We know that.
[00:37:43.603 --> 00:37:44.444]  We understand that.
[00:37:46.604 --> 00:38:02.095]  And just as I said 15 years ago, back in October of 2001 when they passed the Patriot Act, I said over and over again, bigger than Dallas, this will be used in non-terror related cases.
[00:38:02.095 --> 00:38:03.576]  It's what the legislation says.
[00:38:06.715 --> 00:38:10.179]  But forget the legislation, that's just a thin veil cover.
[00:38:10.179 --> 00:38:19.469]  The DEA for 20 plus years had more access to the NSA database than the NSA did.
[00:38:19.469 --> 00:38:26.077]  They kept it compartmentalized because the DEA is part of the CIA arm that brings the narcotics in and then shuts down competition.
[00:38:27.597 --> 00:38:44.244]  And that's why the NSA has it in place where you can't see who goes into the database because the DEA and others are going into the database with parallel construction and seeing that, say, you're growing marijuana or you're doing whatever, or you smuggle in cocaine yourself out of Mexico a few kilos, you're going to sell it.
[00:38:44.244 --> 00:38:46.245]  They don't want you to drive down prices.
[00:38:46.245 --> 00:38:49.466]  They don't want you to be able to have money that the big banks don't control.
[00:38:49.466 --> 00:38:51.387]  This is about vertical integration consolidation.
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:59.514]  And so they're going to go and they're going to bust you and you're going to wonder why, but in court when they indict you, they're going to say that...
[00:39:00.902 --> 00:39:07.148]  Oh, this informant witnessed you do it, and then they got a wiretap, and then they were able to record you.
[00:39:07.148 --> 00:39:21.440]  When it turns out, a year before, they already knew everything you were doing, and went and created a fake investigation, and perjured themselves in front of the judge, who knows full well, every day, the DEA is in front of him or her, in their court, with a fake case made up.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:25.144]  And the sick argument is, well, you were a drug dealer, so it's okay.
[00:39:29.844 --> 00:39:31.245]  And I'm not defending drug dealers.
[00:39:31.245 --> 00:39:42.953]  I mean, a drug dealer of narcotics or other hard drugs is a predator and would be engaged in some other criminal activity if drugs weren't illegal.
[00:39:42.953 --> 00:39:45.415]  So I don't like the criminal culture.
[00:39:45.415 --> 00:39:49.558]  Let me tell you, I don't like the criminal culture that the fake drug war creates corrupting the police.
[00:39:49.558 --> 00:39:53.060]  Again, 10 years of prohibition.
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:54.201]  Prohibition ends in the early 1930s.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:02.404]  They need something new to be illegal, so they made everything at the drugstore basically illegal.
[00:40:02.404 --> 00:40:06.206]  You could buy anything you wanted and drug abuse was a lot lower than it is now.
[00:40:06.206 --> 00:40:10.608]  Look at the numbers.
[00:40:10.608 --> 00:40:12.029]  They made it illegal.
[00:40:12.029 --> 00:40:13.770]  Now it had a lot of money involved.
[00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:16.072]  Now the prostitution money went to it.
[00:40:16.072 --> 00:40:18.473]  Now the robbery money went to it.
[00:40:18.473 --> 00:40:19.934]  Now the shakedown money went to it.
[00:40:19.934 --> 00:40:22.996]  Now people would do anything to get their cocaine or heroin.
[00:40:24.298 --> 00:40:33.303]  And now you could buy it on the street, not pay taxes on it, you could buy off the police with that money, and you could keep control of your mafia systems.
[00:40:33.303 --> 00:40:39.587]  I don't care if you were the Italian mob, the Irish mob, the WASP mob, the Jewish mob.
[00:40:39.587 --> 00:40:41.508]  Those are the real mobs in this country.
[00:40:41.508 --> 00:40:46.011]  And in a mob war, when the Italian mafia tried to muscle in on the Jewish mafia,
[00:40:47.799 --> 00:40:51.201]  A few buttons got punched, and a few switches got flipped.
[00:40:51.201 --> 00:40:53.023]  The FBI got turned loose on them.
[00:40:53.023 --> 00:40:56.705]  Because until the late 40s, early 50s, La Cosa Nostra didn't exist.
[00:40:56.705 --> 00:40:59.267]  J. Edgar Hoover said so to Congress.
[00:40:59.267 --> 00:41:05.691]  It was a conspiracy theory that the Mafia even existed.
[00:41:05.691 --> 00:41:09.794]  And now today, because of Hollywood, we only think the Mafia is Italian.
[00:41:09.794 --> 00:41:12.676]  That shows you how controlling these systems are.
[00:41:12.676 --> 00:41:13.536]  What a joke!
[00:41:13.536 --> 00:41:14.957]  The real Mafia is the CIA.
[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:20.541]  All run by a bunch of guys from Yale and Harvard.
[00:41:20.541 --> 00:41:23.061]  The real Mafia is Hollywood.
[00:41:23.061 --> 00:41:27.022]  The real Mafia is the DEA.
[00:41:27.022 --> 00:41:32.783]  And then the FBI are the errand boys that run around busting all the low-level people.
[00:41:32.783 --> 00:41:33.423]  For the Mafia.
[00:41:33.423 --> 00:41:37.444]  And that's what they've been since the days of J. Edgar Hoover.
[00:41:37.444 --> 00:41:44.625]  But they had lots of movies for you, though, where the FBI's out busting the bad guys.
[00:41:44.625 --> 00:41:44.865]  Yeah.
[00:41:46.018 --> 00:41:56.249]  They were only allowed to bust a few cheesy, flamboyant, over-the-top Italians.
[00:41:56.249 --> 00:42:00.053]  They were not allowed to bust anybody else, and that's the facts about organized crime.
[00:42:00.053 --> 00:42:01.935]  Not all the real Italian crime families.
[00:42:05.242 --> 00:42:12.505]  And again, the real reason the Italian crime families got rooted out is exactly what you see in the movie The Godfather that's a composite of real events that actually happened.
[00:42:12.505 --> 00:42:13.826]  The names have been changed.
[00:42:13.826 --> 00:42:17.267]  Mario Puzo gave speeches before he died admitting that.
[00:42:17.267 --> 00:42:26.291]  Because they wouldn't run child sex slavery and pedophile rings and wouldn't bring in narcotics and sell them to kids.
[00:42:26.291 --> 00:42:32.954]  And so they got pushed out because they wouldn't be part of that.
[00:42:32.954 --> 00:42:34.675]  See, there's the rest of the story.
[00:42:39.121 --> 00:42:42.782]  We're a nation of chumps, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:42.782 --> 00:42:50.285]  The big banks run the whole show, they launder the money, they own the aircraft, and they fly drugs in, kids out.
[00:42:50.285 --> 00:42:53.946]  Drugs in, women out.
[00:42:53.946 --> 00:42:59.068]  Drugs in, stolen art and jewelry out.
[00:42:59.068 --> 00:43:03.250]  And if they can, well, they want to get your five-year-old out of the backyard.
[00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:05.811]  They got some folks in Thailand or Saudi Arabia to sell them to.
[00:43:06.823 --> 00:43:12.346]  And when they're done, your child's gonna be tortured to death, and nobody's coming to help them, because you're trendy.
[00:43:12.346 --> 00:43:19.590]  And you go to fake churches that tell you everything's okay, and you turn on the TV and watch all the cop shows where everything's alright, and it's not alright.
[00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:30.736]  It's not alright.
[00:43:30.736 --> 00:43:34.498]  So just remember that.
[00:43:34.498 --> 00:43:35.299]  Stop being naive.
[00:43:36.616 --> 00:43:48.731]  Because while we sit here so amicably chatting, the most wicked synthesis of evil the planet's ever seen is taking over.
[00:43:51.854 --> 00:44:09.107]  The real mafia puts hydrofluorosilicic acid in the water that eats your glands and eats your brain and gives you pancreatic cancer and bone cancer and brain cancer and lowers your IQ up to 15 points after just six years of exposure.
[00:44:09.107 --> 00:44:18.053]  At 1.3 parts per million.
[00:44:18.053 --> 00:44:19.635]  Just remember, that's who we're dealing with.
[00:44:19.635 --> 00:44:20.515]  You think they're hardcore?
[00:44:20.515 --> 00:44:21.236]  Oh, they're hardcore.
[00:44:22.694 --> 00:44:32.697]  And the good news is, thanks to the majority of government scientists going public and admitting that it's a plan to brain damage the public, they've been forced to cut it by 50% out of the water.
[00:44:32.697 --> 00:44:34.177]  And to ban it as a pesticide.
[00:44:34.177 --> 00:44:40.799]  And I only raise that because you need to realize, folks, we're dealing with some hardcore killers here.
[00:44:40.799 --> 00:44:46.321]  But when their confidence game collapses, it's over for them.
[00:44:46.321 --> 00:44:49.782]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, before I get to the Rand Paul speech I haven't played yet,
[00:44:50.848 --> 00:44:53.130]  I want to make a very important announcement.
[00:44:53.130 --> 00:45:07.441]  Out of all the products we sell at Infowarslife.com that helps fund our operation, so it's a win-win-win, 360 win as I call it, you get the biggest effect I at least personally and other folks have from super male or super female vitality.
[00:45:07.441 --> 00:45:14.447]  But I found that when I don't take it with a Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine, that it doesn't work as well.
[00:45:14.447 --> 00:45:17.929]  And it is the Survival Shield Deep Earth Pure 99999 Crystal Source.
[00:45:21.311 --> 00:45:24.694]  Everybody else has it from seaweed, which is fine.
[00:45:24.694 --> 00:45:34.481]  But this stuff turns bright blue, electric blue, purple on paper, when you put a drop of it with water, or by itself on paper, because it's true iodine.
[00:45:35.939 --> 00:45:41.703]  The other stuff out there is like a 160-year-old recipe, and I'm not against it, but, you know, it's why people feel sick when they take it.
[00:45:41.703 --> 00:45:43.484]  It just doesn't have the same effect.
[00:45:43.484 --> 00:45:48.487]  This is the good halogen that blocks and goes into the thyroid.
[00:45:48.487 --> 00:45:55.212]  All the other bad halogens, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the fluoride, the bromine, the chlorine, those are all the bad halogens.
[00:45:57.196 --> 00:46:05.841]  This stuff's so pure that if you put a little crystal of it on a hot plate, it turns purple and turns into gas in the air.
[00:46:05.841 --> 00:46:18.549]  And that's what we inject directly into the palm oil, and that's what you get is the absolute organic pure essence with zero contaminants in our test of the purest, cleanest, most powerful iodine in the world.
[00:46:18.549 --> 00:46:19.369]  Warning!
[00:46:19.369 --> 00:46:20.690]  Within two weeks of taking it,
[00:46:22.304 --> 00:46:25.346]  Most people go through a detox, so consult your physician.
[00:46:25.346 --> 00:46:28.308]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[00:46:28.308 --> 00:46:31.851]  Rocket fuel.
[00:46:31.851 --> 00:46:39.997]  The globalists are obsessed with iodine themselves, and we've even got a lot of famous people, you name it, rich folks, buying this because they know all about it.
[00:46:39.997 --> 00:46:43.900]  We've been contacted by huge big wigs and nutraceuticals, you name it.
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:51.105]  I mean, I don't know why anybody else wouldn't actually go out and get a mined source of this, but that's what we got.
[00:46:54.875 --> 00:47:02.938]  We're in contact with our exclusive Deep Earth Crystal supplier and we are being told that the supply of these crystals is running low at our drilling site.
[00:47:02.938 --> 00:47:05.019]  We're looking into digging deeper into the earth.
[00:47:05.019 --> 00:47:13.623]  We already dig over 7,000 feet below the surface with expensive drilling technology to ensure that our crystals are super pure and free from radiation and other contaminants.
[00:47:13.623 --> 00:47:15.304]  I've been sitting on this information for weeks.
[00:47:16.044 --> 00:47:22.950]  Well, we tried to secure a larger supply, but folks, Fukushima is getting worse than ever, and it's time to prepare, bottom line.
[00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:28.635]  70% of the original radioactive meltdown was dumped into the Pacific Ocean, and we know it's already hitting the United States.
[00:47:28.635 --> 00:47:39.444]  Now more than 333 containers holding nuclear waste are known and admitted to be damaged and leaking and could explode with hydrogen explosions, each one being a new Fukushima.
[00:47:39.444 --> 00:47:43.908]  Experts are saying a major hydrogen explosion could occur at Fukushima, which we've been
[00:47:45.168 --> 00:47:47.730]  Told, again, would be worse than Chernobyl.
[00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:50.612]  If you're not preparing yourself, you're crazy.
[00:47:50.612 --> 00:47:56.916]  I take Survival Shield X2 every day and I have an entire supply stored away in an emergency storage case.
[00:47:56.916 --> 00:48:05.902]  X2 stores for years, so if you can't get it now while we do have it in stock and store some away, you're nuts.
[00:48:05.902 --> 00:48:07.163]  We suggest you do.
[00:48:07.163 --> 00:48:09.264]  Bulk discounts do apply for 2, 5, and 10 packs.
[00:48:12.267 --> 00:48:16.931]  It's no BS, folks, that this is one of our most powerful, important things we've ever done.
[00:48:16.931 --> 00:48:22.956]  And you can see the over 345 reviews on Infowarslife.com.
[00:48:22.956 --> 00:48:24.498]  The average five stars.
[00:48:24.498 --> 00:48:26.059]  This is no joke.
[00:48:26.059 --> 00:48:30.543]  And I'm sure we're going to be able to get more of the crystals, but we are running low on our current supply.
[00:48:30.543 --> 00:48:35.567]  We have one last batch being made, and then we've got to secure more of the crystals.
[00:48:35.567 --> 00:48:36.889]  We ended up getting the crystals.
[00:48:38.035 --> 00:48:47.078]  Because of economic espionage, our competitors, I'm not in competition with people, but folks think they get a bigger market by knocking somebody else down.
[00:48:47.078 --> 00:48:48.298]  That's not actually how it works.
[00:48:48.298 --> 00:48:50.159]  You have to grow markets overall.
[00:48:50.159 --> 00:48:53.760]  But we're just trying to help people and have a win-win and fund our operation.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:59.102]  Trying to shut down our sources of pure, clean iodine from ocean-based systems.
[00:48:59.102 --> 00:49:06.965]  And while they were busy shutting that down for a while with the DEA, because this is a controlled substance in bulk, not as a dietary supplement,
[00:49:07.645 --> 00:49:09.967]  Because you can do a lot of stuff, obviously, with the raw form.
[00:49:09.967 --> 00:49:15.113]  I mean, it's just a super element.
[00:49:15.113 --> 00:49:24.222]  We were going around looking everywhere for other sources and found this amazing nutromedical grade form that's a byproduct when they're drilling super deep into the earth.
[00:49:26.299 --> 00:49:34.865]  And you've got to just go through a lot of gesticulations, a lot of paperwork, a lot of jumping through hoops to get it.
[00:49:34.865 --> 00:49:36.686]  We've brought it to you.
[00:49:36.686 --> 00:49:38.628]  There's nothing else like it out there.
[00:49:38.628 --> 00:49:41.269]  And compared to other iodines, it's just amazing.
[00:49:41.269 --> 00:49:49.135]  But if you're not going to get our iodine, it is good to get the Himalayan salts or sea salts that are known to have the ocean-borne forms of iodine.
[00:49:49.135 --> 00:49:50.856]  It'll do amazing things for you as well.
[00:49:50.856 --> 00:49:55.239]  That's why the government until the 60s, from the 20s to the 60s, ordered it to be put in the salt.
[00:49:55.839 --> 00:50:03.321]  Because they knew it was good and helped the glands and helped battle goiter and a whole bunch of other disorders that were plaguing the country.
[00:50:03.321 --> 00:50:05.802]  And they admit that IQs went up more than 15%.
[00:50:05.802 --> 00:50:13.224]  You can just search engine that in the Midwest within one generation after they had it put in the salt.
[00:50:13.224 --> 00:50:14.224]  Then they removed it!
[00:50:14.904 --> 00:50:17.065]  And of course, add the bad halogens to the water.
[00:50:17.065 --> 00:50:21.688]  So they know exactly what they're doing, and good scientists are battling this inside the government.
[00:50:21.688 --> 00:50:26.290]  That's why they just cut fluoride by half, and we'll see if the water districts actually do that.
[00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:27.571]  But we're having major victories here.
[00:50:27.571 --> 00:50:29.332]  Infowarslife.com.

[00:53:02.841 --> 00:53:04.021]  You listen closely.
[00:53:04.021 --> 00:53:09.123]  Your pulse rate increases and you wonder if you're prepared for whatever man-made or natural disaster has occurred.
[00:53:09.123 --> 00:53:13.345]  If food became unavailable, would you be able to feed yourself and your family?
[00:53:13.345 --> 00:53:21.448]  Have you checked and found emergency food can cost as much as $300 for a month's supply and is full of weird chemicals and other unpronounceable ingredients?

[00:54:07.663 --> 00:54:25.467]  It makes me sick to my stomach to see John McCain, who two years ago was photographed and videoed with the leaders of Al-Nusra and other Al-Qaeda groups in amongst their command base where they were committing war crimes, mass murder of Christians, non-radical Muslims, you name it.
[00:54:25.467 --> 00:54:31.969]  And then he has the nerve to sit there and say that Rand Paul is going to let us be attacked by terrorists
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:39.863]  When John McCain's doing nothing to secure our borders and has been tacitly supporting Obama coming after our guns.
[00:54:39.863 --> 00:54:43.984]  In the first half of the next hour, I'm going to break down our story.
[00:54:43.984 --> 00:54:47.786]  It's also on The Hill, Politico, and others.
[00:54:47.786 --> 00:54:52.167]  Where they are coming after our guns, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:52.167 --> 00:54:53.888]  It's red-linked on Infowars.com.
[00:54:56.661 --> 00:55:02.262]  Right now, Obama announces draconian, unconstitutional gun regs by executive fiat.
[00:55:02.262 --> 00:55:05.663]  The Justice Department wants to ban more Americans from owning guns.
[00:55:05.663 --> 00:55:07.784]  We list the provisions.
[00:55:07.784 --> 00:55:10.764]  It's on Infowars.com, red-linked, right now.
[00:55:10.764 --> 00:55:12.805]  Send the article out to everyone you know to warn them.
[00:55:12.805 --> 00:55:22.007]  Here's part of Rand Paul's powerful, lengthy speech last night, trying to block the reintroduction of the Patriot Act, the passage, which he was able to do.
[00:55:22.007 --> 00:55:22.407]  Here it is.
[00:55:22.927 --> 00:55:26.608]  Let us be very clear while we're here this evening.
[00:55:26.608 --> 00:55:30.350]  We are here this evening because this is an important debate.
[00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:33.131]  This is a debate over the Bill of Rights.
[00:55:33.131 --> 00:55:36.052]  This is a debate over the Fourth Amendment.
[00:55:36.052 --> 00:55:41.714]  This is a debate over your right to be left alone.
[00:55:41.714 --> 00:55:47.716]  Justice Brandeis said that the right to be left alone is the most cherished of rights.
[00:55:47.716 --> 00:55:48.056]  That's right.
[00:55:48.888 --> 00:55:56.209]  The right to be left alone is the most prized to civilized men.
[00:55:56.209 --> 00:56:05.911]  Let us be clear, we are here tonight because the president continues to conduct an illegal program.
[00:56:05.911 --> 00:56:09.672]  The president has been rebuked by the court.
[00:56:09.672 --> 00:56:16.753]  The president has been told in no explicit terms, the president has been told
[00:56:18.083 --> 00:56:22.387]  That the program he is conducting is illegal.
[00:56:22.387 --> 00:56:25.630]  Now, the president opines on television.
[00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:27.272]  The president wants to blame it.
[00:56:27.272 --> 00:56:30.295]  He says, anybody but me.
[00:56:30.295 --> 00:56:31.576]  But you know what?
[00:56:31.576 --> 00:56:36.261]  The president started this program without congressional permission.
[00:56:36.261 --> 00:56:37.162]  That's right, he expanded it.
[00:56:38.001 --> 00:56:49.205]  Even the authors of the Patriot Act say that the Patriot Act in no way gives authority to the President to collect all of your phone records all of the time.
[00:56:49.205 --> 00:56:50.566]  Yeah, let's hit pause.
[00:56:50.566 --> 00:56:51.446]  Back that up five seconds.
[00:56:51.446 --> 00:56:53.287]  That is so key.
[00:56:53.287 --> 00:56:55.928]  They still don't have it on the books to do what they're doing.
[00:56:55.928 --> 00:56:58.729]  That's why they lie and say it's only metadata.
[00:56:58.729 --> 00:57:03.911]  Metadata, no one's saying the government can't keep phone records.
[00:57:03.911 --> 00:57:05.192]  Or get them from the phone companies.
[00:57:05.192 --> 00:57:05.772]  Those are kept.
[00:57:07.535 --> 00:57:15.580]  No, ladies and gentlemen, they're recording them and creating maps of who you call and what you do.
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:21.284]  I mean, Amazon can give you your order before you click on it and buy it.
[00:57:21.284 --> 00:57:26.007]  They're already preparing to ship it, and that's how smart these computers are.
[00:57:26.007 --> 00:57:27.829]  It's ten times worse than we even know.
[00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:29.450]  I mean, it's just crazy town.
[00:57:30.424 --> 00:57:31.725]  And then they sit up there and deny.
[00:57:31.725 --> 00:57:33.105]  No one's listening to you!
[00:57:33.105 --> 00:57:34.666]  There's zero spying!
[00:57:34.666 --> 00:57:37.548]  My name's Marco Rubio, and the moon is made of cheese.
[00:57:37.548 --> 00:57:39.209]  Let's go back to the clip.
[00:57:39.209 --> 00:57:45.512]  Gives authority to the president to collect all of your phone records all of the time.
[00:57:45.512 --> 00:57:57.259]  If there ever was a general warrant, if there ever was a generalized collection of information from people to which there is no suspicion, this is it.
[00:57:58.635 --> 00:58:01.537]  We are not collecting the information of spies.
[00:58:01.537 --> 00:58:04.939]  We are not collecting the information of terrorists.
[00:58:04.939 --> 00:58:10.163]  We are collecting all American citizens' records all of the time.
[00:58:10.163 --> 00:58:13.705]  This is what we fought the revolution over.
[00:58:13.705 --> 00:58:17.708]  Are we going to so blithely give up our freedom?
[00:58:17.708 --> 00:58:20.950]  Are we going to so blithely go along and just say, take it?
[00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:21.730]  This is so good.
[00:58:21.730 --> 00:58:24.112]  Well, I'm not going to take it anymore.
[00:58:29.636 --> 00:58:37.039]  It's so amazing that they try to spin something this wholesome, this American, this truthful, as treasonous.
[00:58:37.039 --> 00:58:43.523]  It shows the Orwell quote is true, that in a world of universal deceit, tell them the truth so revolution can react.
[00:58:43.523 --> 00:58:44.623]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.455 --> 00:58:54.618]  Alex Jones here with an Infowarslife.com consumer alert report.
[00:58:54.618 --> 00:59:01.942]  Many of you are aware that around the world most populations are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[00:59:01.942 --> 00:59:10.027]  The good news is our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:59:10.027 --> 00:59:11.008]  The bad news is
[00:59:11.348 --> 00:59:19.011]  For the first time in more than a year, supplies at Infowarslife.com of Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine are running low.
[00:59:19.011 --> 00:59:23.813]  But what's even more serious is the supply of these Deep Earth Crystals.
[00:59:23.813 --> 00:59:31.177]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary and only available to Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:31.177 --> 00:59:34.078]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[00:59:34.298 --> 00:59:41.285]  That's why it's more important than ever to secure your current and longtime supply of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 today.
[00:59:41.285 --> 00:59:45.569]  Available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:59:45.569 --> 00:59:48.092]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.424 --> 01:00:06.745]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.745 --> 01:00:08.507]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.507 --> 01:00:10.268]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.268 --> 01:00:11.849]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.849 --> 01:00:13.391]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.391 --> 01:00:17.594]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.594 --> 01:00:22.458]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.458 --> 01:00:31.306]  We've been playing excerpts of Rand Paul's super historic, just amazing, light-in-a-dark-room speech.
[01:00:34.155 --> 01:00:43.201]  I was thinking about Admiral Poindexter wrote a article, or he was heavily quoted in the article.
[01:00:43.201 --> 01:00:50.126]  It was titled, Total Information Awareness Network, New York Times.
[01:00:50.126 --> 01:00:56.711]  And it was in 2002, and this is when I thought everybody was scared and would do whatever the system said.
[01:00:58.726 --> 01:01:02.287]  And it just says everything you do is tracked, everything you do is recorded.
[01:01:02.287 --> 01:01:03.748]  We're going to watch everything you do.
[01:01:03.748 --> 01:01:05.609]  It's going to be an Internet of Things.
[01:01:05.609 --> 01:01:07.849]  Everything will be tracked by smart meters.
[01:01:07.849 --> 01:01:11.931]  This is the new America under the Total Information Awareness Network.
[01:01:11.931 --> 01:01:14.312]  There it is!
[01:01:14.312 --> 01:01:20.754]  Total Information Awareness by Jeffrey Rosen.
[01:01:20.754 --> 01:01:21.815]  And it breaks it all down.
[01:01:23.772 --> 01:01:30.435]  Rand Paul ought to just get up and read that on the Senate floor, where they quote him saying all this.
[01:01:30.435 --> 01:01:31.535]  In fact, will you print me that article?
[01:01:31.535 --> 01:01:32.616]  I want to read some of it.
[01:01:32.616 --> 01:01:38.559]  We're going to cover the Second Amendment with a guest coming up in the next segment.
[01:01:38.559 --> 01:01:41.280]  And then we'll get into China's fearless to fight with U.S.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:48.303]  state media, a bunch of economic news, teachers threatened with fines for violating Michello's school lunch rules.
[01:01:49.585 --> 01:01:56.268]  Because in a free society, you're supposed to have everything your kids eat federalized and have the first lady lecturing you.
[01:01:56.268 --> 01:01:59.490]  But let's go back to Rand Paul's historic speech.
[01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:03.031]  This is what we fought the revolution over!
[01:02:03.031 --> 01:02:07.053]  Are we going to so blithely give up our freedom?
[01:02:07.053 --> 01:02:10.155]  Are we going to so blithely go along and just say, take it?
[01:02:11.581 --> 01:02:13.484]  Well I'm not going to take it anymore.
[01:02:13.484 --> 01:02:16.969]  I don't think the American people are going to take it anymore.
[01:02:16.969 --> 01:02:20.975]  80% of those under 40 say we've gone too far.
[01:02:22.008 --> 01:02:26.491]  That this whole collection of all of our records all the time is too much.
[01:02:26.491 --> 01:02:33.056]  The court has said, how can records be relevant to an investigation that hasn't started?
[01:02:33.056 --> 01:02:44.964]  The court has said that even under these lower standards, even under these standards of saying that it would be relevant, that all of the stuff they are collecting is precisely irrelevant.
[01:02:47.318 --> 01:02:52.861]  Now people say, well, they're not looking at it, they're not listening to it.
[01:02:52.861 --> 01:02:56.183]  It's the tip of the iceberg what we're talking about here.
[01:02:56.183 --> 01:03:02.226]  And realize that they were dishonest about the program until we caught them.
[01:03:02.226 --> 01:03:07.929]  They kept saying over and over again, we're not doing this, we're not collecting your records, and they were!
[01:03:07.929 --> 01:03:15.393]  The head of the intelligence agency lied to the American people and he still works here!
[01:03:17.338 --> 01:03:23.801]  We should be upset, we should be marching in the streets and saying, he's gotta go!
[01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:34.585]  We can't allow this, we can't allow the rule of law to be so trod upon that we live in an arbitrary governmental world where they collect anything they want, anytime they want.
[01:03:34.585 --> 01:03:35.566]  They may kill him.
[01:03:35.566 --> 01:03:37.827]  This is the tip of the iceberg.
[01:03:37.827 --> 01:03:40.468]  They're collecting records through executive order.
[01:03:40.468 --> 01:03:42.208]  They're collecting records through section 702.
[01:03:44.773 --> 01:03:45.734]  Now do you know why I love Rand Paul?
[01:03:45.734 --> 01:03:49.296]  People say, how will we protect ourselves without these programs?
[01:03:49.296 --> 01:03:51.738]  What about using the Constitution?
[01:03:51.738 --> 01:03:55.140]  What about using judicial warrants?
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:04:00.183]  The Sanarif boy, the Boston bomber, they say, how will we look at his phone records?
[01:04:00.183 --> 01:04:01.904]  Get a warrant!
[01:04:01.904 --> 01:04:04.046]  Put his name on it!
[01:04:04.046 --> 01:04:08.649]  You can get a warrant, there's no reason in the world, the guy had already bombed us!
[01:04:08.649 --> 01:04:11.310]  You think anybody was going to turn down a warrant?
[01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:13.152]  We should have gotten a warrant before!
[01:04:14.349 --> 01:04:17.613]  Get warrants on people we have suspicion on.
[01:04:17.613 --> 01:04:20.776]  The Simpson guy that was shot in Garland.
[01:04:20.776 --> 01:04:22.078]  He'd already been arrested.
[01:04:22.078 --> 01:04:23.860]  We had suspicion.
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:27.084]  Let's hire a thousand more FBI agents.
[01:04:27.084 --> 01:04:33.851]  Let's hire people to do the investigation and quit wasting time on innocent American people.
[01:04:34.619 --> 01:04:35.639]  Man, this is good.
[01:04:35.639 --> 01:04:38.381]  Let's be very clear while we're here.
[01:04:38.381 --> 01:04:41.082]  President Obama set this program up.
[01:04:41.082 --> 01:04:44.443]  The President Obama who once was against the Patriot Act.
[01:04:44.443 --> 01:04:49.385]  The President Obama who once said, you know what, we should have judges write warrants.
[01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:51.747]  The President Obama who once believed in the Fourth Amendment.
[01:04:51.747 --> 01:04:53.487]  We're going to go to break.
[01:04:53.487 --> 01:04:57.129]  We'll cover the attack on the Second Amendment straight ahead and more with Senator Rand Paul.
[01:04:59.366 --> 01:05:05.148]  Well, it looks like the Justice Department wants to ban more Americans from owning guns.
[01:05:05.148 --> 01:05:16.432]  That's right, President Barack Hussein Obama is proposing new firearm regulations that will revoke gun rights from those the government declares to be mentally unfit.
[01:05:16.792 --> 01:05:31.944]  And that's a scary thought considering the fact that the official diagnostic system for mental disorders in the US, the DSM-5, is so broad that almost every form of human behavior can be diagnosed as some type of mental illness.
[01:05:32.304 --> 01:05:37.528]  For example, in 2012, the Department of Veteran Affairs sent out letters to U.S.
[01:05:37.528 --> 01:05:42.951]  military veterans to inform them that their competence levels were under review.
[01:05:42.951 --> 01:05:52.158]  If the federal government rated them incompetent, they would be prohibited from purchasing, possessing, receiving, or transporting a firearm or even ammo.
[01:05:52.158 --> 01:05:57.261]  For more details on this story, plus all the day's breaking news, go to InfoWars.com.

[01:06:10.482 --> 01:06:15.266]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:06:15.266 --> 01:06:18.829]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[01:06:30.077 --> 01:06:39.359]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:06:39.359 --> 01:06:43.160]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[01:06:58.903 --> 01:07:00.164]  Another major health threat.
[01:07:00.164 --> 01:07:05.147]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the waters.
[01:07:05.147 --> 01:07:07.809]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:07:07.809 --> 01:07:14.874]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:07:14.874 --> 01:07:17.856]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:07:17.856 --> 01:07:20.899]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:07:20.899 --> 01:07:22.820]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:25.642]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:07:25.742 --> 01:07:31.464]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:34.986]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:07:34.986 --> 01:07:38.067]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:07:38.067 --> 01:07:45.390]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[01:07:45.390 --> 01:07:48.611]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[01:07:54.994 --> 01:08:02.202]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:08:02.202 --> 01:08:08.829]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:11.813]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:21.235 --> 01:08:28.762]  David Codria broke the story that Kit Daniels reported on for InfoWars.com.
[01:08:28.762 --> 01:08:34.027]  Gun control group deceives public by hiring paid actors for hidden camera experiment.
[01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:37.890]  We're going to play the audio and video of this coming up in a moment.
[01:08:37.890 --> 01:08:44.697]  Anti-gun group also reportedly ignored gun laws in filming fake video in New York City.
[01:08:46.544 --> 01:08:53.007]  But before we go to that, we were already scheduled this gentleman last week, but it fits into what's currently happening.
[01:08:53.007 --> 01:08:55.328]  The reports are up on InfoWars.com.
[01:08:55.328 --> 01:08:59.651]  From the Hill, Administration Preps New Gun Regulations.
[01:08:59.651 --> 01:09:08.015]  The headline should be, Administration Prepares to Move Ahead to Restrict Guns Outside of Law by Executive Power Grip.
[01:09:08.015 --> 01:09:12.217]  Just like they've done on so many other issues.
[01:09:13.723 --> 01:09:16.624]  Borders, power plants, military.
[01:09:16.624 --> 01:09:20.706]  It's ruled by Executive Fiat.
[01:09:20.706 --> 01:09:22.527]  And the Justice Department says they're going to move forward.
[01:09:22.527 --> 01:09:26.469]  Well, we went through what those proposals basically are.
[01:09:28.052 --> 01:09:30.793]  The story's up on Infowars.com.
[01:09:30.793 --> 01:09:35.654]  Obama announces draconian unconstitutional gun rags by executive fiat.
[01:09:35.654 --> 01:09:38.595]  The Justice Department wants to ban more Americans from owning guns.
[01:09:38.595 --> 01:09:39.835]  It goes after gun shows.
[01:09:39.835 --> 01:09:41.836]  It goes after private transfers.
[01:09:41.836 --> 01:09:48.618]  It goes after veterans and others where they just claim you're mentally ill with no evidence and suddenly rage you or make you turn your guns in or you can't buy guns.
[01:09:49.698 --> 01:10:06.762]  They're making noises with more AR-15 type bands, 556 restrictions on ammo, everything we just saw a few months ago where they brought forward the new proposal rule, not law, and then had to back off under pressure, but they're back.
[01:10:06.762 --> 01:10:07.583]  This is what they do.
[01:10:07.583 --> 01:10:13.144]  We'll go over more of these sections, but the story is on InfoWars.com by Kit Daniels.
[01:10:15.556 --> 01:10:19.979]  David is a longtime gun rights activist and grassroots leader.
[01:10:19.979 --> 01:10:28.304]  He's been writing professionally on the subject of the right to keep and bear arms since 99, for guns and ammo, handguns, and gun magazines.
[01:10:28.304 --> 01:10:37.990]  He's a panelist selected by the New York Times blog to discuss the Virginia Tech shootings.
[01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:41.672]  Again, David Codria joins us.
[01:10:41.672 --> 01:10:43.113]  We see the brainwashing
[01:10:45.598 --> 01:10:55.001]  Where they come out and say there's more gun crime than there's ever been, when we know it's down, well, Professor Lott was here about a month ago, he said it's down 61%.
[01:10:55.001 --> 01:11:05.404]  But we crunched the Justice Department numbers, which we know they got caught last year trying to make it look worse than it was under White House orders, unprecedented.
[01:11:05.404 --> 01:11:08.805]  But still, that's 51% drop in crime using guns since 1992.
[01:11:11.004 --> 01:11:11.945]  And those numbers are public.
[01:11:11.945 --> 01:11:17.848]  Even the LA Times had to admit, gun crimes down, but perception is it's up.
[01:11:17.848 --> 01:11:31.117]  And that's because of the brainwashing in Hollywood and movies and TV and in the culture from people basically following the orders of the Attorney General.
[01:11:31.117 --> 01:11:35.940]  Who said, just brainwash the public to not like guns.
[01:11:38.991 --> 01:11:41.976]  But look at what happened with the terrorist attack up in Garland.
[01:11:41.976 --> 01:11:44.280]  Folks had guns, they were taken out.
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:46.204]  Look at what the head of Interpol called for last year.
[01:11:46.204 --> 01:11:50.110]  He said it's time for arming people like they do in some areas of the U.S.
[01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:51.292]  so we don't have mall shootings.
[01:11:52.557 --> 01:11:56.179]  The answer to bad people with guns is good people with guns.
[01:11:56.179 --> 01:11:59.821]  But I'm not going to go over all the tried and true known facts.
[01:11:59.821 --> 01:12:13.409]  The bigger issue here is a whole new assault is coming extra legislatively, extra judicially, directly from the gun grabbers themselves.
[01:12:13.409 --> 01:12:21.634]  And they're now admittedly, when we had Mr. Lott on, Professor Lott, Dr. Lott a few, three or four weeks ago, is they're coming out with fake statistics now.
[01:12:22.745 --> 01:12:35.187]  Just like they got caught with fake statistics on how positive gay marriage is and how wonderful it is and how wonderful those relationships are and how people, once they're exposed to it, love it.
[01:12:35.187 --> 01:12:36.868]  I'm not even here bashing gays.
[01:12:36.868 --> 01:12:38.448]  It's not even on my radar screen.
[01:12:38.448 --> 01:12:39.808]  The point is it came out last week.
[01:12:39.808 --> 01:12:44.689]  It was fake studies at major universities.
[01:12:44.689 --> 01:12:47.390]  So from fake studies to fake crime statistics to
[01:12:49.972 --> 01:12:53.254]  Now, fake videos, which you could tell they're actors.
[01:12:53.254 --> 01:12:55.055]  I mean, they think the public is so dumb.
[01:12:55.055 --> 01:12:56.676]  David's here to break it down for us.
[01:12:56.676 --> 01:13:00.898]  David, thank you for coming on the broadcast today.
[01:13:00.898 --> 01:13:03.920]  Well, Alex, thanks very much for having me on.
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:09.023]  It's great to have your crew reach out to me like this, because this is an important story.
[01:13:09.023 --> 01:13:12.185]  Because everything that the anti-gunners do
[01:13:13.223 --> 01:13:14.965]  is based on a lie.
[01:13:14.965 --> 01:13:27.277]  You know, you mentioned Dr. Lott, and they're trying to now take his studies, which prove that guns in the hands of private citizens deter crime, and they're trying to say, oh, well, you know, that's not true.
[01:13:27.277 --> 01:13:35.286]  They're trying to take the studies out of people like Gary Kleck, who talks about the number of defensive gun uses per year, and say, oh, that's not true.
[01:13:35.286 --> 01:13:36.447]  So all they ever present
[01:13:36.847 --> 01:13:49.038]  Is the cost of so-called gun violence, which is overwhelmingly done by criminals who, if you take a look at their existing laws, are not allowed to have guns anyway, and we see how well that works.
[01:13:49.038 --> 01:13:53.782]  All of these things are aimed at us peaceable American gun owners.
[01:13:54.221 --> 01:14:00.008]  It's no surprise to see this administration is trying to do things through executive order.
[01:14:00.008 --> 01:14:04.373]  It's also no surprise to see this being spearheaded by the Justice Department.
[01:14:04.373 --> 01:14:08.919]  And it's no surprise to see that the Republican establishment has been so silent on this.
[01:14:09.332 --> 01:14:14.895]  Right up through to and including the Loretta Lynch confirmation as Attorney General.
[01:14:14.895 --> 01:14:22.399]  I mean, who is surprised that she is not a continuation of Eric Holder and that she is a creature of the Obama White House?
[01:14:27.502 --> 01:14:30.583]  Articles that you write for multiple magazines and publications.
[01:14:30.583 --> 01:14:34.223]  Codrea, C-O-D-R-E-A, DavidCodrea.com.
[01:14:34.223 --> 01:14:35.584]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:14:35.584 --> 01:14:36.684]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:14:36.684 --> 01:14:40.765]  If you just joined us, he also writes for Examiner.com.
[01:14:40.765 --> 01:14:54.388]  David, if gun owners are awake, we know they're coming after our guns, we know they're predatory, we know it's about totalitarianism, finally people are getting hardcore, it's why we're beginning to gain some ground, but the empire is striking back.
[01:14:54.388 --> 01:14:55.968]  How do you expect this to play out?
[01:14:57.165 --> 01:15:06.192]  When they come in with all these new executive actions outside of law to restrict the Second Amendment, will it be like California, where it's kind of a cold war against gun owners?
[01:15:06.192 --> 01:15:12.057]  Or could Obama go offensive out in the open with some really draconian moves?
[01:15:12.057 --> 01:15:25.227]  Well, I expect to see him test the limits using executive actions, and then of course what that unfortunately does is that creates a victim in the system, and then we're entered into the legal system
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:31.044]  Where things are long and drawn out and then you get an activist judge to say, oh no, this is fine, this is okay.
[01:15:31.044 --> 01:15:39.590]  And I think what we're seeing is a new paradigm, not among Americans, because civil disobedience is a long and time honored tradition among Americans.
[01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:45.674]  But on gun owners, we've kind of been conditioned that, you know what, we have these lobbying groups and if something goes wrong,
[01:15:46.516 --> 01:15:58.165]  What we do is we write a form email that tracks to our representative or our senator, which does of course absolutely no good if your senators are Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer.
[01:15:58.165 --> 01:16:15.820]  Okay, so we're seeing a new paradigm among gun owners that is basically illustrated by the I Will Not Comply movement that we see exemplified in Washington State and now recently over the weekend in Oregon State that had an I Will Not Comply rally to protest their basically new
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:22.127]  Law that says that it's illegal for you to transfer your property to someone else.
[01:16:35.376 --> 01:16:38.099]  Came in and said, no, we're going to have a Second Amendment rally there.
[01:16:38.099 --> 01:16:44.304]  Undoubtedly, that's what the folks died for there, was the right to keep and bear arms, when Santa Ana said, turn your guns in.
[01:16:44.304 --> 01:16:54.975]  And about 1,500 people showed up, of every race, color, and creed, to give a speech there, violating the city law, saying no open carry of handguns or rifles.
[01:16:55.515 --> 01:16:57.296]  Well, it no doubt scares the anti-gunners.
[01:16:57.296 --> 01:16:58.416]  I think that it also causes
[01:17:14.085 --> 01:17:30.731]  A degree of discomfort among the establishment gun lobby organizations that heretofore have basically been able to control the narrative and to count on their lobbying efforts and their public relations effort to tell the gun owner side of the story.
[01:17:30.731 --> 01:17:31.572]  And that's fine and good.
[01:17:31.572 --> 01:17:33.192]  I don't, not that I believe in that.
[01:17:33.192 --> 01:17:34.833]  I've been doing that for decades.
[01:17:34.833 --> 01:17:43.436]  But what I also believe is that there comes a time when you have no other recourse and now the rubber meets the road and you have to say, I'm either going to obey this edict
[01:17:43.942 --> 01:17:46.405]  Or I'm going to defy and resist this eating.
[01:17:46.405 --> 01:17:49.228]  And no one can make that decision for you except yourself.
[01:17:50.953 --> 01:18:02.598]  Well, the establishment, I think, has taken our restraint as a sign of weakness, when instead we've been preparing, making political inroads, warning people, setting up political defenses.
[01:18:02.598 --> 01:18:09.662]  But I think now they've gone from being arrogant to really starting to realize we're not backing down, we're not going away.
[01:18:09.662 --> 01:18:18.266]  They may have dumbed down half the population, but still there is a giant group of Americans, a cross-section, that is growing, that is not going to submit.
[01:18:19.827 --> 01:18:23.849]  Yeah, I've seen people who had their lives destroyed.
[01:18:23.849 --> 01:18:31.533]  Case in point, Wayne Fincher out of Arkansas, who constructed his own machine gun, had perfectly constitutional justification for doing it.
[01:18:31.533 --> 01:18:38.396]  It was not something that was entered into interstate commerce to give any kind of pretext to get a tax imposed on this thing.
[01:18:38.866 --> 01:18:41.067]  And he was sentenced to six and a half years.
[01:18:41.067 --> 01:18:45.950]  The judge actually denied the reading of the Constitution in his trial.
[01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:57.858]  And the poor man was so harassed by the end of things that when his wife died while he was in prison, the authorities would not let him out on a controlled release to attend her funeral.
[01:18:57.858 --> 01:19:00.760]  This is, you got to take it down to the human level.
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:04.342]  I mean, not just to tell anecdotes, but to let people understand
[01:19:04.844 --> 01:19:07.530]  This isn't just something that you read about in the news.
[01:19:07.530 --> 01:19:09.674]  This has effects on real people.
[01:19:09.674 --> 01:19:13.341]  This has effects, you who are watching this, on your freedoms.
[01:19:13.341 --> 01:19:15.205]  Well that's another point I was going to ask you.
[01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:29.164]  When we come back from break, they seem to persecute veterans, libertarians, conservatives, gun owners, people with no criminal records, people that are salt of the earth, with vitriolic pleasure.
[01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:32.766]  How do they get people at the ATF and other agencies?
[01:19:32.766 --> 01:19:36.727]  Because I've had them come up to me at the gun show and get in my face when I'm just there giving a speech.
[01:19:39.469 --> 01:19:40.890]  Why do they hate us so much?
[01:19:40.890 --> 01:19:43.433]  Why do they hate good people so much?
[01:19:43.433 --> 01:19:45.936]  I mean, how did they get... Who are these people?
[01:19:45.936 --> 01:19:48.519]  Because you've been, you know, fighting for, you know, decades.
[01:19:48.519 --> 01:19:54.465]  I want to get your take on who we're up against, what their mentality is, because it's good to know the enemy.
[01:19:54.465 --> 01:19:57.829]  And it's good to come right out with the fact that these people are the enemies of the Constitution.
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:02.141]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.
[01:20:02.141 --> 01:20:03.222]  Get back to nature.

[01:20:58.766 --> 01:21:18.523]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[01:21:18.523 --> 01:21:18.944]  Well then,
[01:21:19.264 --> 01:21:23.325]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:21:23.325 --> 01:21:24.866]  Hdfirearms.com.
[01:21:24.866 --> 01:21:28.187]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, special ops people.
[01:21:28.187 --> 01:21:33.308]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.

[01:21:39.610 --> 01:21:44.032]  Buy right off their website, and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice.
[01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:47.413]  You can pick it up at the gun show, you can pick it up at a local sporting goods store.

[01:21:58.485 --> 01:22:02.750]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:03.370]  It's true.
[01:22:03.370 --> 01:22:07.275]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:07.495 --> 01:22:09.899]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:09.899 --> 01:22:14.666]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:14.666 --> 01:22:23.199]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides,
[01:22:23.379 --> 01:22:27.542]  Bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.

[01:22:58.075 --> 01:23:00.196]  Are you suffering from E.P.?
[01:23:00.196 --> 01:23:03.078]  The symptoms include fraudulent charges to your credit card.
[01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:05.719]  Your subway card says it's empty, but you bought it yesterday.
[01:23:05.719 --> 01:23:10.502]  Someone's been in your hotel room, but the desk clerk says they only show you entering the room.
[01:23:10.502 --> 01:23:12.283]  These are signs of E.P.
[01:23:12.283 --> 01:23:13.924]  Electronic pickpocketing.
[01:23:13.924 --> 01:23:17.026]  Payment cards, transit cards, even hotel room keys.
[01:23:17.026 --> 01:23:22.369]  Use a radio chip so you can just wave your card at the register, the turnstile, or your hotel room door.
[01:23:22.369 --> 01:23:26.311]  But what's convenient for you is also convenient for thieves, waving scanners,
[01:23:26.571 --> 01:23:29.633]  To electronically pickpocket you without even touching you.
[01:23:29.633 --> 01:23:31.875]  The good news is there's a cure.
[01:23:31.875 --> 01:23:37.218]  ID Stronghold has created leather wallets and clutches that have built-in EP protection.
[01:23:37.218 --> 01:23:43.142]  Layers of shielding material cleverly concealed in a beautiful leather wallet that stops the symptoms of EP.

[01:23:52.448 --> 01:24:06.539]  If you experience these emotions, immediately inform your friends and family about idstronghold.com so they can feel better too.
[01:24:06.539 --> 01:24:07.980]  You're the pretender!
[01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:10.662]  What if I say I will never surrender?
[01:24:10.662 --> 01:24:15.766]  David Cogria, writer for guns and ammo, handguns, guns, you name it.
[01:24:17.879 --> 01:24:20.500]  Joins us, DavidCodria.com.
[01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:23.942]  We'll list about 40 after, then I'm going to get into geopolitical and economic news.
[01:24:23.942 --> 01:24:24.622]  I haven't hit yet.
[01:24:24.622 --> 01:24:29.444]  It's more of Rand Paul and his historic speech yesterday.
[01:24:29.444 --> 01:24:37.388]  But worldwide, there are corporate robber baron interests, on record, they don't even deny this anymore, that are taking over whole countries.
[01:24:37.388 --> 01:24:41.650]  And the first thing they want when they take a country over is to disarm the public.
[01:24:41.650 --> 01:24:44.131]  This is not brain surgery or rocket science.
[01:24:46.468 --> 01:24:50.569]  And people can say, yeah, well, Hitler, you know, he didn't take the guns with new laws.
[01:24:50.569 --> 01:24:51.789]  He already had laws in the books.
[01:24:51.789 --> 01:24:54.830]  Yeah, he used already existing laws.
[01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:58.831]  The point is, this will always be used to oppress.
[01:24:58.831 --> 01:25:00.252]  And people finally get this.
[01:25:00.252 --> 01:25:02.652]  They understand this point.
[01:25:02.652 --> 01:25:12.835]  And then, I see the Feds that are involved in their war against the Second Amendment, and they just, from what I've seen, hate the guts
[01:25:13.894 --> 01:25:15.614]  of the American people.
[01:25:15.614 --> 01:25:21.136]  That doesn't mean a group of federal marshals I run into protecting a vice president are bad guys.
[01:25:21.136 --> 01:25:22.596]  They're listeners.
[01:25:22.596 --> 01:25:23.556]  Guys I ran into.
[01:25:23.556 --> 01:25:27.077]  Or doesn't mean all the FBI guys, you know, hate patriots.
[01:25:27.077 --> 01:25:30.858]  In fact, most cops in national studies are pro-Second Amendment.
[01:25:30.858 --> 01:25:32.518]  It's like 98%.
[01:25:32.518 --> 01:25:39.720]  So there's kind of a paradox here where you've got special political kind of commissar units of the federal government
[01:25:42.045 --> 01:25:44.908]  That's tough to actually come up with a definitive answer on.
[01:25:44.908 --> 01:25:48.311]  All you can really do, Alex, is go based on experience, you know?
[01:26:01.781 --> 01:26:13.428]  I'm from the generation, I suspect you are too, that we were raised thinking that Ephraim Zimbalist on the FBI or Peter Graves with his impossible mission force were not a threat to civil liberties, they were out there protecting us.
[01:26:13.428 --> 01:26:20.792]  We couldn't conceive of Maloy and Reid on Adam-12 coming in on a no-knock raid and shooting our poodle.
[01:26:20.792 --> 01:26:22.813]  And you have all kinds.
[01:26:22.813 --> 01:26:26.075]  You know, we had within the ATF, we had some whistleblowers come forward.
[01:26:26.468 --> 01:26:32.332]  These guys were raised thinking that they were doing a service that they were protecting.
[01:26:32.332 --> 01:26:34.233]  They're different in a way.
[01:26:34.233 --> 01:26:42.359]  They didn't really, though, study things like the Federalist Papers and the thoughts of the founders.
[01:26:42.359 --> 01:26:49.344]  But there are another group altogether that seem to take a sadistic pleasure in the power.
[01:26:49.344 --> 01:26:52.166]  If I could segue for a second, in a past career,
[01:26:52.942 --> 01:27:03.749]  I was responsible for getting permits from several major cities in Southern California and just the level of power trip that you would meet in city clerk offices.
[01:27:03.749 --> 01:27:11.114]  So that's it, exactly, it's the power trip you see in private sector, in government, it's people on power trips.
[01:27:11.114 --> 01:27:19.220]  Yeah, and unfortunately when you get people on power trips with authority and with weaponry calling the shots
[01:27:19.679 --> 01:27:25.267]  You get essentially the new brown shirts that are more than happy to enforce the new intolerable acts.
[01:27:25.905 --> 01:27:28.546]  And for those people who say, well, you know, this is America.
[01:27:28.546 --> 01:27:30.247]  We have the right to free speech.
[01:27:30.247 --> 01:27:31.448]  We have the right to vote.
[01:27:31.448 --> 01:27:33.069]  It can never happen here.
[01:27:33.069 --> 01:27:37.151]  I bet you somebody in Weimar Republic would have said, you know, this could never happen here.
[01:27:37.151 --> 01:27:39.212]  We're the most civilized country in Europe.
[01:27:39.212 --> 01:27:40.653]  I think you hit on something there.
[01:27:40.653 --> 01:27:47.436]  I think we've gotten to the point where people finally understand it can happen here and it is happening here.
[01:27:47.436 --> 01:27:48.937]  Have we hit that wake up moment?
[01:27:48.937 --> 01:27:54.420]  And then how do these two forces, the immovable object, the unstoppable force, what happens when they collide?
[01:27:55.362 --> 01:27:58.304]  I believe that we're almost at a stalemate.
[01:27:58.304 --> 01:28:07.769]  I pray sometimes that the people who want to oppress us aren't stupid enough to pull the trigger.
[01:28:07.769 --> 01:28:15.834]  I fear sometimes that they are, and if and when they are, I think that they're going to be surprised that there is going to be a critical mass.
[01:28:15.834 --> 01:28:19.035]  It doesn't have to be everyone.
[01:28:19.035 --> 01:28:22.297]  My friend Mike Vanderbilt estimates that something like 3% of the colonists
[01:28:23.882 --> 01:28:24.042]  I think?
[01:28:53.081 --> 01:28:55.764]  Unfortunately, that kind of leaves us on our own.
[01:28:55.764 --> 01:29:12.439]  Unfortunately, if you try to organize, that lends itself to agents provocateur and infiltrators and people trying to get the low-hanging fruit to do dumb things so that they can then further justify exactly against the public and of course, you know, wild headlines to
[01:29:15.721 --> 01:29:19.944]  Sure, but I mean, look, 3% started the Revolutionary War, 5% won it.
[01:29:19.944 --> 01:29:23.087]  That's historically admitted by a lot of professors that have done the analysis.
[01:29:23.087 --> 01:29:27.550]  As you said, I think if it does kick off physically, which we're trying to avert,
[01:29:29.173 --> 01:29:30.774]  I think we're going to be surprised.
[01:29:30.774 --> 01:29:34.557]  It's going to be like 10% of the gun owners are going to end up standing up.
[01:29:34.557 --> 01:29:42.444]  If there's 170 million gun owners, 150 million gun owners, I mean, we're talking about 15, 17 million people.
[01:29:42.444 --> 01:29:48.769]  And if the globalists couldn't take Baghdad, I mean, for all their bravado and all their arrogance, they're going to be deep in you know what.
[01:29:48.769 --> 01:29:50.170]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.170 --> 01:29:52.692]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.692 --> 01:29:55.374]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.753 --> 01:30:12.848]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays, which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants.
[01:30:14.147 --> 01:30:26.137]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI, who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure agreements, forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[01:30:26.137 --> 01:30:42.411]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment, and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying, where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[01:30:42.851 --> 01:30:47.855]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming, it's already here.
[01:30:47.855 --> 01:30:52.098]  This is Darren McBreen and I invite you to join the resistance.
[01:30:52.098 --> 01:30:52.919]  InfoWars.com
[01:30:58.612 --> 01:30:59.573]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:30:59.573 --> 01:31:00.133]  Good, brother.
[01:31:00.133 --> 01:31:01.874]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:31:01.874 --> 01:31:03.816]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:31:03.816 --> 01:31:07.839]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:31:07.839 --> 01:31:10.461]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:31:10.461 --> 01:31:12.882]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:31:12.882 --> 01:31:20.728]  SuperMill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:31:20.928 --> 01:31:24.290]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:31:24.290 --> 01:31:25.832]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:31:25.832 --> 01:31:28.874]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:31:28.874 --> 01:31:30.515]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:31:30.515 --> 01:31:33.257]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[01:31:33.257 --> 01:31:36.319]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated.
[01:31:36.579 --> 01:31:38.360]  Or maximum potency.
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:44.821]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience.
[01:31:44.821 --> 01:31:48.582]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[01:31:48.582 --> 01:31:50.363]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:31:50.363 --> 01:31:57.305]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:31:58.473 --> 01:32:03.615]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:18.082]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[01:32:28.326 --> 01:32:29.347]  Alex Jones here.
[01:32:29.347 --> 01:32:38.635]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:32:38.635 --> 01:32:42.438]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[01:32:42.438 --> 01:32:50.764]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[01:32:50.764 --> 01:32:53.567]  Visit Infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:32:53.567 --> 01:32:54.547]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:33:02.348 --> 01:33:04.690]  I was trained in firearms.
[01:33:04.690 --> 01:33:06.851]  I carried a concealed weapon.
[01:33:06.851 --> 01:33:15.817]  I made the determination that if somebody was going to try to take me out, I was going to take them with me.
[01:33:15.817 --> 01:33:29.706]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[01:33:31.613 --> 01:33:36.496]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:33:36.496 --> 01:33:38.838]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:38.838 --> 01:33:40.759]  I'm not a revolutionary.
[01:33:40.759 --> 01:33:42.921]  I'm a restorationist.
[01:33:42.921 --> 01:33:45.322]  I want my Republic back.
[01:33:45.322 --> 01:33:48.765]  Because it's the best system the world's ever created.
[01:33:48.765 --> 01:33:51.807]  That humans have ever developed.
[01:33:51.807 --> 01:33:57.711]  What we're seeing today is just rule of gangs, rule of combines, rule of special interest.
[01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:01.101]  These billionaires all have bodyguards.
[01:34:01.101 --> 01:34:03.662]  Michael Moore's got six bodyguards armed.
[01:34:03.662 --> 01:34:08.304]  It's been in the news when they get arrested with guns in illegal areas, like airports.
[01:34:08.304 --> 01:34:18.768]  And he has the nerve to get up on MSNBC and say, quote, gun owners are racist people in the country scared of blacks.
[01:34:18.768 --> 01:34:23.710]  That's all they've got, is to invoke race instead of going, let's look at where we have gun control.
[01:34:23.710 --> 01:34:25.490]  Chicago, DC, New York.
[01:34:25.490 --> 01:34:26.451]  Highest crime rates.
[01:34:27.617 --> 01:34:33.142]  Liberal Democratic areas disarming black people and then letting crime run rampant.
[01:34:33.142 --> 01:34:37.226]  And of course the first gun laws were against black people in this country.
[01:34:37.226 --> 01:34:42.790]  It is such a bankrupt... I mean, I played the Fox News clip, Fox Sports clip.
[01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:45.273]  I played ESPN clips.
[01:34:45.273 --> 01:34:46.714]  Remember the talking point last year?
[01:34:46.714 --> 01:34:50.337]  That the NRA is the new Klan?
[01:34:50.337 --> 01:34:52.639]  The NRA was founded to fight the Klan.
[01:34:52.639 --> 01:34:54.561]  They inverse everything!
[01:34:57.150 --> 01:35:00.532]  I've been at gun rallies and had people walk up and go, you're just a big fat racist!
[01:35:00.532 --> 01:35:04.815]  I'm talking about white yuppies and I really am sick of them.
[01:35:04.815 --> 01:35:06.696]  They have no intellectual acumen.
[01:35:06.696 --> 01:35:09.558]  They have no historical understanding.
[01:35:09.558 --> 01:35:12.580]  All they have is arrogance of their totalitarian cult.
[01:35:12.580 --> 01:35:13.681]  They are not liberals!
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.722]  It's liberal to keep more of your money.
[01:35:16.722 --> 01:35:18.463]  It's liberal to have your own property.
[01:35:18.463 --> 01:35:20.825]  It's liberal to raise your kids as you see fit.
[01:35:20.825 --> 01:35:23.107]  It's liberal to be able to associate with who you want.
[01:35:23.107 --> 01:35:24.929]  It's liberal to not be spied on.
[01:35:24.929 --> 01:35:29.212]  It's liberal to be able to have guns to protect yourself.
[01:35:29.212 --> 01:35:31.815]  It's liberal to be able to travel where you want.
[01:35:31.815 --> 01:35:39.581]  It's liberal to read and have knowledge and to have more freedom, not less.
[01:35:39.581 --> 01:35:41.323]  That's liberal.
[01:35:41.323 --> 01:35:42.464]  Not totalitarian.
[01:35:43.473 --> 01:35:45.034]  But you have these mental midgets.
[01:35:45.034 --> 01:35:46.315]  In fact, I played a clip yesterday.
[01:35:46.315 --> 01:35:47.456]  I'm tempted to play it again.
[01:35:47.456 --> 01:35:53.601]  My son went out to see if we could duplicate what happened in New York and Times Square where no one knew what the TPP was.
[01:35:53.601 --> 01:35:56.103]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[01:35:56.103 --> 01:36:02.087]  And Austinites were just as dumb.
[01:36:02.087 --> 01:36:05.850]  They didn't know what planet they were on.
[01:36:05.850 --> 01:36:09.172]  But they could talk about racism.
[01:36:09.172 --> 01:36:11.094]  You're not a conspiracy theorist, are you?
[01:36:12.318 --> 01:36:16.682]  You're not racist, are you?
[01:36:16.682 --> 01:36:23.910]  That's all they could say.
[01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:24.931]  It's amazing.
[01:36:24.931 --> 01:36:31.497]  When you have knowledge, that's all they say is conspiracy theory, and then it makes them feel superior because they know a magic $5 word.
[01:36:34.241 --> 01:36:43.047]  We're going to go back to our guest here in a moment to finish up with the attack on the Second Amendment and where it's going and talk about this article that Kit Daniels wrote about that our guest broke.
[01:36:43.047 --> 01:36:45.809]  Gun control group deceives public by hiring paid actors.
[01:36:45.809 --> 01:36:47.930]  I'm going to talk about that for Hidden Camera Experiment.
[01:36:47.930 --> 01:37:02.720]  But before we do that, we have made an America section of ball caps, belt buckles, long-sleeve shirts, short-sleeve shirts, women's cut shirts with gold foil, Molon Labe,
[01:37:04.091 --> 01:37:08.672]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com or MadeIn1776.com.
[01:37:08.672 --> 01:37:15.674]  Then we have a section of even less expensive t-shirts that are not made in the U.S., but it's your decision.
[01:37:15.674 --> 01:37:17.755]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:17.755 --> 01:37:21.796]  And we have this hat that I believe is the best looking ball cap I've ever seen.
[01:37:21.796 --> 01:37:23.776]  Made in America, super high quality.
[01:37:23.776 --> 01:37:25.837]  It simply says 1776.
[01:37:25.837 --> 01:37:29.278]  It has a little Gadsden flag, rattlesnake on the side.
[01:37:30.532 --> 01:37:33.593]  And it says made in 1776 on the back.
[01:37:33.593 --> 01:37:45.575]  And I wear this hat out, I wear the black t-shirt that goes along with it that you can get, and people invariably, invariably, and it is expensive, because it's made in America and it's high quality.
[01:37:45.575 --> 01:37:51.416]  It's expensive compared to other hats that are made in China.
[01:37:51.416 --> 01:37:54.156]  And people come up to me and they say, what's 1776 mean?
[01:37:54.156 --> 01:37:56.957]  It's non-threatening, but it's a great conversational piece.
[01:37:58.809 --> 01:38:07.272]  Separately, I had the idea when PAC's son got criticized and banned an upside-down American flag, and I'm sure they probably did mean it as a disrespectful thing.
[01:38:07.272 --> 01:38:11.173]  That's a big leftist thing to hate the American flag and try to ban it.
[01:38:11.173 --> 01:38:12.333]  Or burn it.
[01:38:12.333 --> 01:38:17.375]  We come up with a shirt that says Save America with an upside-down flag with a U.S.
[01:38:17.375 --> 01:38:23.857]  flag coat under it, and on the back it says, Our Republic is in distress, ask me why.
[01:38:23.857 --> 01:38:25.438]  InfoWars.com.
[01:38:27.108 --> 01:38:30.569]  Ask anybody that flies flags upside down at their house or on their truck.
[01:38:30.569 --> 01:38:33.809]  It will cause conversations.
[01:38:33.809 --> 01:38:37.430]  Well, this is a great shirt to get people asking questions.
[01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:38.590]  And it says, Ask Me Why.
[01:38:38.590 --> 01:38:40.311]  And the shirt is a bestseller.
[01:38:40.311 --> 01:38:41.891]  Appreciate you for your support.
[01:38:41.891 --> 01:38:43.271]  That's how we fund this operation.
[01:38:43.271 --> 01:38:49.012]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:38:49.012 --> 01:38:51.313]  We'll take it our supplement section.
[01:38:51.313 --> 01:38:53.113]  And shifting gears into that briefly,
[01:38:54.795 --> 01:39:07.846]  It's very important for folks to understand that when you get into nutraceuticals and you get into trying to get the very highest quality, it is very time-consuming, very hard to do.
[01:39:07.846 --> 01:39:10.128]  I mean, it's easy just to put crud out.
[01:39:10.128 --> 01:39:11.369]  It's hard to put quality out.
[01:39:12.049 --> 01:39:19.355]  And we have high quality survival shield, original iodine, the good halogen for your thyroid, other glands, done amazing things.
[01:39:19.355 --> 01:39:20.616]  You've heard the right reviews.
[01:39:20.616 --> 01:39:31.805]  Then we found about a year and a half ago a source of deep earth pure crystals that isn't based in seaweed or other ocean botanicals that is even more pure and even stronger.
[01:39:33.134 --> 01:39:41.721]  Well, we're running out of our current manufactured supply of that, and with a reproduction, we're going to be basically out of it.
[01:39:41.721 --> 01:39:52.189]  So if you want to stockpile this, you've seen us run out of some products for four, five months, that could easily happen with Survival Shield, Nacin Iodine X2, and InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:39:52.189 --> 01:39:54.291]  So stock up and support the broadcast today.
[01:39:54.291 --> 01:39:56.653]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:39:57.822 --> 01:40:04.326]  David, again, writer for Guns and Ammo magazine, handguns, you name it.
[01:40:04.326 --> 01:40:10.170]  He's also, his reports have been in the New York Times, Associated Press, etc.
[01:40:10.170 --> 01:40:17.956]  He was named Gun Rights Defender of the Month by the Citizens Committee on the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, and Journalist of the Year by the Second Amendment Foundation.
[01:40:17.956 --> 01:40:21.458]  I want to kind of give you the floor for the last ten minutes.
[01:40:21.458 --> 01:40:26.221]  Anytime you want it, you can call for the video, we can play it, or just roll the video behind you.
[01:40:26.221 --> 01:40:26.862]  But I wanted you
[01:40:31.824 --> 01:40:43.948]  Well, first of all, about the video, I think it's important that we clear up that everybody knew that the actors were actors in this video.
[01:40:43.948 --> 01:40:48.210]  I don't think it surprised anyone except the so-called progressives.
[01:40:48.752 --> 01:40:49.873]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:40:49.873 --> 01:40:59.823]  They use racism as the new scarlet letter, the R instead of the A, to try to make us afraid to speak out because then they'll call us bad names.
[01:40:59.823 --> 01:41:01.465]  They call themselves progressives.
[01:41:01.465 --> 01:41:07.791]  What they are is the exact opposite of that, which is why I say every day for them is opposite day.
[01:41:07.791 --> 01:41:12.596]  But what I did with this report was I filed a Freedom of Information Act request
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:19.682]  With the Mayor's Office of Film and Entertainment in the City of New York, and I proved that they were actors.
[01:41:19.682 --> 01:41:25.063]  I mean, we all suspected it because they walk into this gun store, this fake gun store, which we knew was fake.
[01:41:25.063 --> 01:41:28.264]  We knew that the guy behind the counter at the gun store was fake.
[01:41:28.264 --> 01:41:29.105]  He's an actor.
[01:41:29.105 --> 01:41:34.246]  He's done voice work for, oh gosh, one of the video games.
[01:41:34.246 --> 01:41:40.788]  I think it's Grand Theft Auto 5 or something like that, which was actually so violent that
[01:41:41.195 --> 01:41:46.420]  They banned it in Australia from the Kmart's and stores like that there.
[01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:49.703]  But we knew this was a fake setup there.
[01:41:49.703 --> 01:41:51.264]  I see the guy right there.
[01:41:51.264 --> 01:42:02.113]  And we knew that these were fake guns as well, because in New York, you can't even go into a gun store and handle the gun unless you first apply for a permit.
[01:42:02.113 --> 01:42:07.178]  And then, of course, you see these guys that are breaking Jeff Cooper, Colonel Cooper, the gunner's gurus,
[01:42:07.651 --> 01:42:30.676]  rule against putting your finger on the trigger every one of them invariably is basically doing unsafe gun handling practices because you always treat all guns as if they're loaded and you never stick your finger on the trigger until you're ready to actually fire a shot and you have the gun properly aimed, you know your target, you know what's behind it.
[01:42:30.676 --> 01:42:34.277]  That's just basic common gun sense which the other side of course
[01:42:34.725 --> 01:42:41.278]  Says, and claims for their own, and of course with progressives, every day is opposite day.
[01:42:41.278 --> 01:42:45.326]  By proving that these were actors, this puts to the lie the sham
[01:42:45.885 --> 01:42:52.150]  That they were doing a social experiment with hidden cameras to debunk gun myths.
[01:42:52.150 --> 01:42:53.251]  No, they weren't.
[01:42:53.251 --> 01:42:54.792]  They had actors.
[01:42:54.792 --> 01:42:58.795]  I know from the permits that they brought in 45 crew members.
[01:42:58.795 --> 01:43:01.838]  I know from the permits that they brought in five trucks.
[01:43:01.838 --> 01:43:08.002]  What I don't know from the permits, though, was all those hundreds of replica firearms that they brought in.
[01:43:08.002 --> 01:43:12.346]  And when I asked the mayor's office about that, their response on the phone was,
[01:43:12.805 --> 01:43:18.682]  Oh well, the NYPD was there and they were making sure that these weren't real guns and so no permits were needed.
[01:43:20.246 --> 01:43:29.813]  There are entire standards, first of all, in New York and in New York City against imitation firearms that tightly control those.
[01:43:29.813 --> 01:43:34.135]  There are standards within the film industry that they have to comply with.
[01:43:34.135 --> 01:43:43.882]  And so the fact that I did not get any permitting information or any documentation on the NYPD saying that these guns were okay,
[01:43:44.409 --> 01:43:48.012]  Also raises the question of, well then they weren't accounted for either.
[01:43:48.012 --> 01:43:49.633]  You have no idea what they were.
[01:43:49.633 --> 01:43:51.694]  You have no idea how many there were.
[01:43:51.694 --> 01:43:53.876]  You have no idea how they were transported.
[01:43:53.876 --> 01:43:56.238]  Nobody signed in for them in receiving.
[01:43:56.238 --> 01:44:00.881]  Nobody signed in for them to send them back so that we can... Sure, let me just briefly interrupt you.
[01:44:00.881 --> 01:44:02.922]  David Cudria is our guest, DavidCudria.com.
[01:44:04.123 --> 01:44:05.845]  It's about the culture of deception.
[01:44:05.845 --> 01:44:10.688]  Obviously anybody that's a gun owner and knows any basic facts could tell this was a fraud.
[01:44:10.688 --> 01:44:14.911]  Guns don't say on them, I killed a little boy or I killed an old lady.
[01:44:14.911 --> 01:44:18.854]  But for the progressives that are so ignorant, they thought it was real.
[01:44:19.844 --> 01:44:24.146]  This thing's designed, it shows the video of the hidden cameras being put in.
[01:44:24.146 --> 01:44:29.548]  They attempted to run this fraud, thinking the general public is as dumb as they are.
[01:44:29.548 --> 01:44:42.474]  And I find it so apropos, so poignant, so fitting, so perfect, that you've got a guy involved in an indiscriminate, ultra-violence, you know, video game where they rape women and shoot people.
[01:44:43.624 --> 01:44:53.957]  And run folks over with violent video games connected directly to psychotic breaks with Prozac heads, killing people, and then they have the nerve to try to restrict us.
[01:44:53.957 --> 01:44:55.920]  It's just over the top, sorry.
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:45:02.048]  Yeah, no, and it's part and parcel, but the other people that have fooled Alex, and this is what's really disturbing.
[01:45:03.007 --> 01:45:07.410]  It fooled the media elites who were reporting on this as if it were real.
[01:45:07.410 --> 01:45:09.032]  I'm writing an article right now.
[01:45:09.032 --> 01:45:12.435]  As a matter of fact, my deadline is later this afternoon for Guns Magazine.
[01:45:12.435 --> 01:45:14.056]  I am a field editor.
[01:45:14.056 --> 01:45:17.019]  I do their Rights Watch column for them every month.
[01:45:17.019 --> 01:45:23.985]  And basically I'm analyzing Adweek, which is like the number two trade publication in the advertising industry.
[01:45:23.985 --> 01:45:27.548]  And the guy who wrote the article on that was under the assumption that
[01:45:28.106 --> 01:45:31.749]  The guns were real, that the people were real.
[01:45:31.749 --> 01:45:37.234]  They actually had their minds changed by these powerfully persuasive arguments of the anti-gunners.
[01:45:37.234 --> 01:45:44.120]  And on top of that, he's basically saying, yes, these were actually the guns that were used in the crimes.
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:47.183]  Like, you're going to have Adam Lanza's Bushmaster?
[01:45:47.907 --> 01:45:54.230]  Okay, and you're going to be having that in a retail store for retail prices to first-time gun buyers?
[01:45:54.230 --> 01:45:56.971]  And it's not going to be, like, impounded right now in some evidence?
[01:45:56.971 --> 01:46:00.453]  Sir, I think you're giving them too much of a benefit of the doubt here.
[01:46:00.453 --> 01:46:02.934]  The media just needs an excuse to run hoaxes.
[01:46:02.934 --> 01:46:05.455]  I think they probably know it's all fake.
[01:46:05.455 --> 01:46:06.855]  This is what they do.
[01:46:06.855 --> 01:46:09.737]  There's a new level of lying is what I'm saying.
[01:46:09.737 --> 01:46:12.278]  They seem to have tripled down.
[01:46:12.278 --> 01:46:15.719]  Yeah, no, I can't argue with that.
[01:46:15.719 --> 01:46:17.400]  It just seems amazing, though.
[01:46:18.171 --> 01:46:27.152]  I run into not only the outright deception, but I run into ignorance all the time too, you know, where somebody, you know, a cop gets involved in a shooting.
[01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:50.216]  and uses his clock and the reporter refers to it as his service revolver so I mean there is a tremendous amount of ignorance and of course we see Bloomberg has set up with what's the school journalism Columbia School of Journalism I believe where he's bringing journalists in with a bunch of anti-gun analysts to teach them how to report on gun news and it's just ridiculous so we have
[01:46:50.856 --> 01:46:59.562]  The idiots that are the authorized journalists, but we also have the people that you referred to, and I call them fourth estate fifth columnists.
[01:46:59.562 --> 01:47:01.283]  Amazing.
[01:47:01.283 --> 01:47:02.584]  So where is this going now?
[01:47:02.584 --> 01:47:05.166]  I mean, is the media going to keep reporting it like it's real?
[01:47:07.308 --> 01:47:11.331]  Well, in this particular story, I think everybody's going to kind of go silent.
[01:47:11.331 --> 01:47:18.258]  You can go to the C-SPIRE, the States United Facebook page and Twitter account and things like that.
[01:47:18.258 --> 01:47:19.379]  They're not going to admit this.
[01:47:19.379 --> 01:47:21.161]  They know they've been caught.
[01:47:21.161 --> 01:47:23.203]  You're not going to see the media report on this.
[01:47:23.203 --> 01:47:24.584]  You're not going to see a retraction.
[01:47:25.131 --> 01:47:25.492]  I think so.
[01:47:40.875 --> 01:47:48.019]  Well sure, but I mean to have Bloomberg out quote teaching journalism students how to report on gun news, how transparent is that?
[01:47:48.019 --> 01:47:54.102]  And as you said, and as Dr. Lotz said, they're gearing up for a major offensive with this information.
[01:47:54.102 --> 01:48:00.245]  I think their last attempt at a gun grab backfired on them because it was so blatant.
[01:48:00.245 --> 01:48:06.708]  What do you think this new attack's going to be and what's the latest on Bloomberg trying to finance local races around the country?
[01:48:07.622 --> 01:48:10.328]  Well, Bloomberg should be no surprise to people.
[01:48:10.328 --> 01:48:17.062]  I was reporting a couple years ago how he was busily going through all of the various states and registering
[01:48:17.572 --> 01:48:23.313]  Incorporations through all the states to set up exactly the types of efforts that he's doing right now.
[01:48:23.313 --> 01:48:28.094]  All we can really rely on, ultimately, is that we tell the truth.
[01:48:28.094 --> 01:48:44.038]  Now, there's obviously a real disparity between the reach of a guy like me and the reach of somebody who's got a show on NBC or CBS or CNN or even MSNBC or the New York Times or the Washington Post or the LA Times.
[01:48:44.747 --> 01:48:46.869]  All that is just a given.
[01:48:46.869 --> 01:48:53.155]  It's the battle space, if you will, the intellectual or ideological battle space that we have to deal with.
[01:48:53.155 --> 01:48:55.037]  But we continue to tell the truth.
[01:48:55.037 --> 01:48:57.459]  We continue to reach a critical mass.
[01:48:57.459 --> 01:49:03.285]  And that critical mass continues to educate themselves and continues to be force multipliers.
[01:49:03.285 --> 01:49:04.466]  Spread the word.
[01:49:04.466 --> 01:49:08.350]  Because again, when we don't have the same reach, we rely on
[01:49:09.417 --> 01:49:09.577]  Sure.
[01:49:09.577 --> 01:49:09.797]  Sure.
[01:49:24.466 --> 01:49:24.626]  Yeah.
[01:49:45.629 --> 01:49:51.330]  But these are radicals enslaving us, so as men and as humans, we have an instinct to say no to it.
[01:49:51.330 --> 01:49:57.232]  And I think they've really miscalculated because the awakening is accelerating, but they are coming.
[01:49:57.232 --> 01:50:05.254]  And I, as you said, David, I pray every day they're not stupid enough to try to start a hot war with American gun owners, because
[01:50:06.752 --> 01:50:13.595]  They hate the military, they hate police, they hate the general public, they think we're all just going to kill each other, and that's not the way this is going to go.
[01:50:13.595 --> 01:50:23.558]  And they'll find out, like the Nazis and the Communists, everybody else, that we're going to end up basically tracking them down, we're going to have our own Nuremberg trials, and they're going to end up being brought to justice.
[01:50:23.558 --> 01:50:26.719]  They're not going to get away with this.
[01:50:26.719 --> 01:50:31.301]  Yeah, and again, I'm not going to start anything with anyone.
[01:50:31.301 --> 01:50:36.003]  I simply want to live my life and be left in peace to live my life in
[01:50:36.553 --> 01:50:37.994]  Absolutely.
[01:50:37.994 --> 01:50:40.877]  David Codria, I want to have you back up in the near future.
[01:50:40.877 --> 01:50:45.321]  Thank you for your defense of the Second Amendment that protects all the rest.
[01:50:45.321 --> 01:50:46.281]  God bless you.
[01:50:46.281 --> 01:50:47.843]  They'll be back, folks, with more news.
[01:50:47.843 --> 01:50:48.223]  Stay with us.
[01:50:59.650 --> 01:51:03.775]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:03.775 --> 01:51:06.959]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:06.959 --> 01:51:08.581]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:08.581 --> 01:51:11.925]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:11.925 --> 01:51:13.447]  Infidel Body Armor.

[01:51:15.316 --> 01:51:17.637]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.

[01:51:30.612 --> 01:51:31.433]  This is Dan Pilla.
[01:51:31.433 --> 01:51:33.214]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:51:33.214 --> 01:51:34.856]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:34.856 --> 01:51:37.698]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:37.698 --> 01:51:39.980]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:39.980 --> 01:51:44.504]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:51:44.504 --> 01:51:48.447]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[01:51:52.631 --> 01:51:53.972]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:51:59.676 --> 01:52:16.356]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[01:52:16.356 --> 01:52:19.840]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then.
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:24.085]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:52:24.085 --> 01:52:25.786]  Hdfirearms.com.
[01:52:25.786 --> 01:52:29.110]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[01:52:29.110 --> 01:52:34.236]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[01:52:34.236 --> 01:52:35.077]  It's always about security.
[01:52:35.077 --> 01:52:35.657]  I think so.
[01:52:59.782 --> 01:53:00.442]  In the U.S.
[01:53:00.442 --> 01:53:04.603]  alone, a home invasion occurs every 13 seconds.
[01:53:04.603 --> 01:53:09.544]  On top of that, the average response time for 911 is over 15 minutes.
[01:53:09.544 --> 01:53:11.145]  That just won't cut it.
[01:53:11.145 --> 01:53:15.005]  Don't allow yourself or the important people in your life to be victims.
[01:53:15.005 --> 01:53:18.826]  When seconds matter, don't be caught stumbling for your firearm.
[01:53:18.826 --> 01:53:20.987]  Get the protection you deserve.
[01:53:20.987 --> 01:53:24.948]  Get yourself a hidden holster from HiddenHolster.com.
[01:53:24.948 --> 01:53:26.548]  It's the original hidden holster.
[01:53:27.188 --> 01:53:30.150]  The Hidden Holster is quick, easy, and convenient.
[01:53:30.150 --> 01:53:34.912]  It's versatile enough for the home, workplace, or virtually anywhere else you might need it.
[01:53:34.912 --> 01:53:38.975]  Have peace of mind with your firearm close by at all times.
[01:53:38.975 --> 01:53:40.876]  Go to HiddenHolster.com.
[01:53:40.876 --> 01:53:43.417]  That's HiddenHolster.com.
[01:53:43.417 --> 01:53:46.779]  If you own a firearm, you need a Hidden Holster.
[01:53:46.779 --> 01:53:51.122]  Your protection matters, and self-defense is the best defense.
[01:53:51.122 --> 01:53:52.883]  Go to HiddenHolster.com.
[01:53:52.883 --> 01:53:55.064]  That's HiddenHolster.com.
[01:53:55.064 --> 01:53:56.705]  The original Hidden Holster.
[01:54:09.602 --> 01:54:20.913]  Anthony Cumia of the popular Opie and Anthony Show is going to be joining us for about 45 minutes to the next hour, maybe the whole hour, take some phone calls.
[01:54:20.913 --> 01:54:25.257]  He wants to get into the state of the media landscape, which I want to talk about.
[01:54:25.257 --> 01:54:35.146]  That's why I asked him on last week with the report of hundreds of newspapers going under, thousands preparing to go under, broadcast media in trouble.
[01:54:36.988 --> 01:54:41.149]  We're also going to get into Bilderberg that's coming up and the state of the police in the community.
[01:54:41.149 --> 01:54:49.872]  We've got a lot of police news because it's come out that the police killed about 400 people in the line of duty last year.
[01:54:49.872 --> 01:55:06.057]  And I really want to flesh this out because when the Washington Post and the New York Times and CNN and MSNBC, a group of media operations, a constellation,
[01:55:07.486 --> 01:55:32.934]  That fundamentally want to destroy this country, and fundamentally want tyranny, and fundamentally want to take over for foreign banks, who support the screw job of Obamacare, who support open borders, who support taking our guns, who support abortion, and then they sit up there on their high horse and say the police are horrible, and the police need to be federalized, and the police are the problem.
[01:55:32.934 --> 01:55:35.795]  You'd have to be an idiot not to know it's a setup.
[01:55:39.304 --> 01:55:46.429]  And there's nothing I dislike more than third world police, or cops that are on power trips and act like thugs.
[01:55:46.429 --> 01:55:58.576]  The problem is, that's not what's really happening on average, and it's a very evil distortion, and there is a plan to cause a civil war in this country.
[01:55:58.576 --> 01:56:06.762]  When they come after the guns, and we need to short circuit the whole stinking thing, and the police need to do it as well,
[01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:20.004]  Just bashing the police is designed to make them go into gang mentality and circle the wagons and close ranks and then the feds are going to come in as their saviors.
[01:56:20.004 --> 01:56:26.426]  All this George Soros stuff is designed to do is to drive the police into the arms of the feds.
[01:56:26.426 --> 01:56:28.807]  And just can't we be smart enough to see through it?
[01:56:28.807 --> 01:56:30.748]  Can't we be smart enough to derail it?
[01:56:30.748 --> 01:56:34.409]  Can't we understand the enemy operation?
[01:56:34.409 --> 01:56:36.230]  So I want to talk about how to reform the police as well.
[01:56:38.743 --> 01:56:41.705]  And I don't really know Anthony's views on this.
[01:56:41.705 --> 01:56:48.970]  He's a pretty smart guy when he's not, you know, making sex jokes or whatever, which I'm not judging.
[01:56:48.970 --> 01:56:49.771]  Fine.
[01:56:49.771 --> 01:56:50.471]  That's what you're into.
[01:56:50.471 --> 01:56:52.093]  Knock yourselves out.
[01:56:52.093 --> 01:56:53.594]  It's just an interesting show to go on.
[01:56:53.594 --> 01:56:56.916]  I like going on it sometimes and thought, why not return the favor?
[01:56:56.916 --> 01:56:59.438]  Come on my show.
[01:56:59.438 --> 01:57:00.379]  So he's going to be joining us.
[01:57:00.379 --> 01:57:01.459]  I think he's been on the show before.
[01:57:01.459 --> 01:57:02.480]  I don't know.
[01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:04.361]  It all blurs together when you do this every day.
[01:57:06.368 --> 01:57:19.479]  Government wipes recent vaccine inquiry data, injury data from website, big news on InfoWars.com, because it keeps coming out, people being damaged and having to pay off, the people that were brain damaged and the vaccines killing people.
[01:57:19.479 --> 01:57:24.364]  And so now that data had been published on the Fed's own website, now they've pulled it.
[01:57:24.364 --> 01:57:27.386]  That's on InfoWars.com.
[01:57:27.386 --> 01:57:33.792]  China's official state-run media repeated what they said last week and said they're fearless and ready to take the fight to the U.S.
[01:57:35.168 --> 01:57:43.791]  Vietnam says that they've got intel that large artillery is being placed on the man-made sandcastles, as the Pentagon calls them, in the South China Sea.
[01:57:43.791 --> 01:57:45.951]  And that's what this is really about.
[01:57:45.951 --> 01:57:47.352]  There's oil and gas out there.
[01:57:47.352 --> 01:57:50.153]  Vietnam, three years ago, claimed it.
[01:57:50.153 --> 01:57:54.934]  China's already had combat with ships and on their border with Vietnam the last year.
[01:57:54.934 --> 01:57:59.075]  In fact, Vietnam's basically at war with China right now.
[01:57:59.075 --> 01:58:00.136]  And it wouldn't be the first time.
[01:58:00.136 --> 01:58:02.276]  They've had a whole bunch of wars with China.
[01:58:02.276 --> 01:58:04.437]  That's why it was stupid to try to invade Vietnam, folks.
[01:58:05.319 --> 01:58:11.241]  Because, I mean, they just have been fighting for a couple thousand years and anybody tries to take them over.
[01:58:11.241 --> 01:58:14.842]  But I digress on that subject.
[01:58:14.842 --> 01:58:18.744]  This is all about getting that oil and gas.
[01:58:18.744 --> 01:58:22.825]  And quite frankly, those islands have never belonged to China.
[01:58:22.825 --> 01:58:27.267]  In fact, most of those islands didn't exist before.
[01:58:27.267 --> 01:58:28.507]  They're making them.
[01:58:28.507 --> 01:58:30.948]  And so it is a very provocative move by China.
[01:58:31.892 --> 01:58:33.533]  What is our government doing?
[01:58:33.533 --> 01:58:36.534]  Arming China with every weapon system you can imagine under the sun.
[01:58:36.534 --> 01:58:37.575]  Third hour, coming up.
[01:58:37.575 --> 01:58:40.977]  Spread the word.
[01:58:40.977 --> 01:58:43.538]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.538 --> 01:58:44.639]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:49.281 --> 01:59:05.948]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[01:59:05.948 --> 01:59:09.450]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[01:59:09.790 --> 01:59:13.695]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:59:13.695 --> 01:59:15.397]  hdfirearms.com.
[01:59:15.397 --> 01:59:23.826]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people, they're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[01:59:23.826 --> 01:59:24.667]  It's always about security.
[01:59:24.667 --> 01:59:25.047]  I think so.
[01:59:51.850 --> 01:59:54.449]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:05.285 --> 02:00:06.686]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.686 --> 02:00:07.587]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.587 --> 02:00:08.448]  Big Brother's not good yet.
[02:00:08.448 --> 02:00:10.209]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.209 --> 02:00:10.930]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.930 --> 02:00:11.791]  So we're told.
[02:00:11.791 --> 02:00:13.352]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.352 --> 02:00:17.536]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.536 --> 02:00:21.599]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.738 --> 02:00:28.219]  We're now into the third hour.
[02:00:28.219 --> 02:00:32.082]  We have a guest joining us to break down the police state.
[02:00:32.082 --> 02:00:34.444]  Bilderberg coming up here in just a few weeks.
[02:00:34.444 --> 02:00:38.907]  Rob Dewitt and others will be in Austria covering it.
[02:00:38.907 --> 02:00:55.940]  But you see the conniption fit, the hysterical running around in circles screaming that if government and corporations don't spy on everything we do and what we eat and what books we read and record every one of our phone calls that vicious, horrible al-Qaeda people will crawl out from underneath the table and bite us on the feet.
[02:00:57.930 --> 02:01:00.251]  And I'm not making a joke about the threat of Islamic terrorism.
[02:01:00.251 --> 02:01:03.033]  The point is, the West is openly funding the whole thing.
[02:01:03.033 --> 02:01:07.014]  Now that's been admitted.
[02:01:07.014 --> 02:01:17.640]  And so you wonder, how can they have Marco Rubio and John McCain and Obama get up on television and say there is no domestic spying, it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:20.101]  How can you have that when it's known it's going on?
[02:01:20.987 --> 02:01:27.513]  When, back when they thought we were all afraid in the New York Times in 2002, 3, 4, 5, they admitted the whole thing.
[02:01:27.513 --> 02:01:29.834]  Petraeus just three years ago admitted it all.
[02:01:29.834 --> 02:01:35.459]  Clapper gets up and goes, we do not collect any data, period, inside the U.S.
[02:01:35.459 --> 02:01:36.340]  They want to excuse us?
[02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:39.322]  Because the lie was just so over the top.
[02:01:39.322 --> 02:01:41.084]  How do they do it?
[02:01:41.084 --> 02:01:44.367]  Well, this piece aired on Friday's Nightly News.
[02:01:44.367 --> 02:01:45.608]  This is not scripted.
[02:01:45.608 --> 02:01:46.568]  These are not actors.
[02:01:46.568 --> 02:01:48.070]  My son, Rex Jones, went out.
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:50.960]  Talked about 20-something people.
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:51.881]  This is just part one.
[02:01:51.881 --> 02:01:54.962]  We're going to show all the people.
[02:01:54.962 --> 02:01:58.743]  And he went out and every one of them didn't know what the TPP was.
[02:01:58.743 --> 02:02:01.884]  But some would say you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:02:01.884 --> 02:02:03.424]  Because that's what they've heard.
[02:02:03.424 --> 02:02:08.325]  If someone warns you about government corruption, it must just be a delusional theory.
[02:02:08.325 --> 02:02:13.087]  And you look in the eyes of these people, these are trendies down by the University of Texas, they don't know
[02:02:15.393 --> 02:02:16.834]  How to find their butt with both hands.
[02:02:16.834 --> 02:02:20.935]  I mean, they don't know what country they're in, what planet they're on.
[02:02:20.935 --> 02:02:23.356]  Here's the clip.
[02:02:23.356 --> 02:02:25.317]  What do you think the TPP is?
[02:02:25.317 --> 02:02:26.497]  TTP?
[02:02:26.497 --> 02:02:27.797]  No, what is TTP?
[02:02:27.797 --> 02:02:29.218]  The DPP?
[02:02:29.218 --> 02:02:29.978]  The what?
[02:02:29.978 --> 02:02:31.719]  TPP.
[02:02:31.719 --> 02:02:33.099]  I have no idea.
[02:02:33.099 --> 02:02:33.800]  Nope.
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:34.680]  I have no idea what that is.
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:36.200]  I ain't got a clue.
[02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:37.241]  I have no idea.
[02:02:37.241 --> 02:02:40.842]  Do any of y'all know what the heck the TPP is?
[02:02:40.842 --> 02:02:41.282]  Any of y'all?
[02:02:41.282 --> 02:02:41.702]  TPP?
[02:02:41.702 --> 02:02:42.663]  No.
[02:02:42.663 --> 02:02:42.923]  Uh, no.
[02:02:45.086 --> 02:02:47.808]  Nobody knows what this is!
[02:02:47.808 --> 02:02:48.688]  I have no idea.
[02:02:48.688 --> 02:02:52.411]  The toilet paper products.
[02:02:52.411 --> 02:02:57.094]  The Texas Petroleum people?
[02:02:57.094 --> 02:02:57.954]  The terrorist group?
[02:02:57.954 --> 02:02:59.055]  I don't know.
[02:02:59.055 --> 02:03:04.138]  My name is a WWE Thunderstruck Rollercoaster.
[02:03:04.138 --> 02:03:07.120]  God bless you.
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:08.240]  Words of wisdom.
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:10.362]  I would honestly have no idea.
[02:03:10.362 --> 02:03:13.884]  Well, it gives information.
[02:03:17.016 --> 02:03:21.681]  Well, I don't know exactly the words in English.
[02:03:21.681 --> 02:03:23.322]  And that's what we call guessing.
[02:03:23.322 --> 02:03:28.047]  Probably some Congress thing about homeless men.
[02:03:28.047 --> 02:03:30.409]  Tyrannical people in power.
[02:03:30.409 --> 02:03:32.792]  Actually pretty close, actually pretty darn close.
[02:03:32.792 --> 02:03:34.113]  What is that paper?
[02:03:34.113 --> 02:03:36.255]  The TPP, or the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[02:03:36.255 --> 02:03:37.757]  Trans, trans what?
[02:03:38.297 --> 02:03:57.015]  Pacific Partnership is an alliance of corporate global businesses that will then be able to, in any of the three segments, Asian, Pacific, European, or American, will be able to bypass any or all of the laws and rules in that place and be able to deal with currency and due process.
[02:03:57.015 --> 02:03:58.657]  What do you think about that?
[02:03:58.657 --> 02:04:02.581]  Reminds me of what China does with their free market zones.
[02:04:03.621 --> 02:04:11.083]  I would definitely have to hear a lot more information because this sounds a lot like a bit of conspiracy theory to me.
[02:04:11.083 --> 02:04:14.044]  I think it sounds a little bit far-fetched.
[02:04:14.044 --> 02:04:15.064]  I'm being totally honest.
[02:04:15.064 --> 02:04:19.345]  I just don't care right now.
[02:04:19.345 --> 02:04:20.045]  Is that bad?
[02:04:20.045 --> 02:04:22.666]  I was just so unprepared for this.
[02:04:22.666 --> 02:04:24.466]  I think that's awesome, dude.
[02:04:24.466 --> 02:04:26.807]  Yeah, I think it's awesome.
[02:04:26.807 --> 02:04:29.327]  Why?
[02:04:29.327 --> 02:04:31.668]  Because we need people like that, I guess.
[02:04:32.825 --> 02:04:34.546]  I literally have no clue.
[02:04:34.546 --> 02:04:38.127]  I've never... I haven't watched news in a while, man.
[02:04:38.127 --> 02:04:40.527]  Okay, well, there you have it.
[02:04:40.527 --> 02:04:42.608]  He hasn't watched news.
[02:04:42.608 --> 02:04:44.189]  None of us have.
[02:04:44.189 --> 02:04:49.850]  We just vote for Obama and pray that he doesn't smite us with his mighty hand of vengeance.
[02:04:49.850 --> 02:04:54.532]  My first question for you is, which party do you support?
[02:04:54.532 --> 02:04:55.652]  Third party, Libertarian.
[02:04:59.355 --> 02:05:02.377]  Let's talk about the real war on women.
[02:05:02.377 --> 02:05:05.219]  First wave feminism was a noble cause.
[02:05:05.219 --> 02:05:06.720]  But modern feminists?
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:07.240]  Ha!
[02:05:07.240 --> 02:05:15.166]  Well, instead of fighting for, say, paid and protected maternity leave, they want to ban words, shirts, and manspreading.
[02:05:15.606 --> 02:05:16.626]  Come on!
[02:05:16.626 --> 02:05:24.148]  That's cultural Marxism, which asserts that culture and language is responsible for oppressing women, and not the state.
[02:05:24.148 --> 02:05:27.828]  The truth is, the state encourages gender wars.
[02:05:27.828 --> 02:05:32.229]  It's a divide-and-conquer tactic designed to keep us fighting amongst ourselves.
[02:05:32.229 --> 02:05:37.110]  In fact, the feminist movement was hijacked by the political class to exploit women.
[02:05:37.110 --> 02:05:41.111]  As the late Aaron Russo revealed, the Rockefellers bankrolled feminism.
[02:05:41.591 --> 02:05:48.219]  Not because they had any interest in women's rights, but because women in the workforce was the ultimate trifecta.
[02:05:48.219 --> 02:05:55.767]  The state collects more tax dollars, children are indoctrinated at an earlier age, and the traditional family structure destroyed.
[02:05:55.767 --> 02:05:58.551]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[02:05:59.091 --> 02:06:18.817]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[02:06:18.817 --> 02:06:23.239]  Well then, about six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.

[02:08:09.941 --> 02:08:12.582]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:12.582 --> 02:08:20.647]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:08:20.647 --> 02:08:24.149]  Anthony Cumia is our guest in this hour.
[02:08:24.149 --> 02:08:26.190]  I've been on his show five or six times.
[02:08:26.190 --> 02:08:27.310]  Very interesting.
[02:08:27.310 --> 02:08:29.291]  Big response when I go on.
[02:08:29.291 --> 02:08:31.873]  It's on, of course, XM Sirius, big popular podcast.
[02:08:31.873 --> 02:08:33.573]  He has a whole bunch of different shows.
[02:08:33.573 --> 02:08:34.974]  Anthonycumia.com.
[02:08:34.974 --> 02:08:36.895]  C-U-M-I-A.
[02:08:36.895 --> 02:08:38.116]  From the Opie and Anthony Show.
[02:08:39.964 --> 02:08:45.946]  And I wanted to get him on a whole host of issues a few weeks ago, but obviously now that we've got him, other things have been breaking.
[02:08:45.946 --> 02:08:50.547]  But one of the things I wanted to bring up with him is actually in a list of stuff he sent me.
[02:08:50.547 --> 02:08:59.770]  And that's the lay of the land in the media and where things are today and what the media is going to look like in the future.
[02:08:59.770 --> 02:09:02.811]  One thing's for sure, there's a lot of new media
[02:09:03.908 --> 02:09:05.069]  A lot of it is exploding.
[02:09:05.069 --> 02:09:06.730]  A lot of it is growing.
[02:09:06.730 --> 02:09:09.653]  Some of the old stars of the new media aren't as big as they were.
[02:09:09.653 --> 02:09:12.055]  Some are bigger.
[02:09:12.055 --> 02:09:20.241]  But what we know is dinosaur broadcast TV, cable TV, newspapers are in trouble.
[02:09:20.241 --> 02:09:26.146]  And it's not just because of the format or even the quote competition.
[02:09:26.146 --> 02:09:28.528]  It's that they won't even compete.
[02:09:28.528 --> 02:09:29.449]  You turn into CNBC or MSNBC,
[02:09:31.772 --> 02:09:40.415]  And they got big expensive sets and big budgets, but it's all these political hacks from both parties that have given themselves shows.
[02:09:40.415 --> 02:09:46.637]  Not because they were talented in the media or a good journalist, but because they were somebody's chief of staff.
[02:09:46.637 --> 02:09:52.339]  So maybe they can go home and tell mom, hey look, I'm on TV, but everybody can be on TV today.
[02:09:52.339 --> 02:10:00.482]  So it really does come down to what is the most informative, what is the most interesting, who's been the most accurate in the past.
[02:10:01.874 --> 02:10:11.318]  I'll tell you, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, all of our media systems grow on average at about 30-40% a year.
[02:10:11.318 --> 02:10:14.179]  That's an exponential growth curve.
[02:10:14.179 --> 02:10:26.484]  But then Alexa.com, an Amazon company, and World Daily wrote about this seven months ago when it started, just delisted every libertarian or conservative site out there and just cut our ratings by 80%.
[02:10:26.484 --> 02:10:30.866]  Even though Google Analytics and all of our systems, we showed these side by side, show us going up.
[02:10:33.151 --> 02:10:40.574]  They just lowered us and then every socialist fake liberal thing was skyrocketed on the same day.
[02:10:40.574 --> 02:10:44.236]  The same day, October 1st, 2014.
[02:10:44.236 --> 02:10:45.896]  So they're gonna play games?
[02:10:45.896 --> 02:10:50.098]  It's come out that Nielsen has been caught cooking the ratings for MSNBC and CNN.
[02:10:50.098 --> 02:10:50.859]  It won't matter!
[02:10:50.859 --> 02:10:52.639]  Your sponsors won't get a response.
[02:10:52.639 --> 02:10:54.040]  Let me explain something to our enemies.
[02:10:56.038 --> 02:10:58.019]  Some of you live in your own world.
[02:10:58.019 --> 02:11:08.325]  Our advertisers don't buy advertising off of Arbitron, even though we're on stations that are, you know, are Arbitron folks.
[02:11:08.325 --> 02:11:09.765]  We're on commercial stations as well.
[02:11:09.765 --> 02:11:12.007]  I kind of have a leg in both worlds.
[02:11:12.007 --> 02:11:14.328]  And they don't buy it from Nielsen's or other ad agencies.
[02:11:14.328 --> 02:11:18.090]  We have some ad agency buys, but that's just because they know about results.
[02:11:19.389 --> 02:11:22.112]  Results is what gets people to advertise.
[02:11:22.112 --> 02:11:23.113]  Results!
[02:11:23.113 --> 02:11:27.858]  There's a reason you're all going bankrupt and are profit-loss divisions.
[02:11:27.858 --> 02:11:30.201]  It's because you're like a dead animal.
[02:11:30.201 --> 02:11:31.842]  People want to just get you in the ditch.
[02:11:31.842 --> 02:11:33.864]  They don't want you in the living room.
[02:11:33.864 --> 02:11:36.868]  They want to bury you and forget you.
[02:11:36.868 --> 02:11:39.591]  Flush you down the toilet like a rotting goldfish!
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:44.263]  So, keep it up, keep lying, keep cheating, keep doing it.
[02:11:44.263 --> 02:11:44.903]  That's my view on it.
[02:11:44.903 --> 02:11:46.044]  We're going to get his take on that.
[02:11:46.044 --> 02:11:50.427]  Bilderberg, the current state of police in the community, I want to get his take on it.
[02:11:50.427 --> 02:11:53.970]  I want to talk about what my view is on it and a lot more.
[02:11:53.970 --> 02:12:00.374]  So, Anthony of the Opie and Anthony Show, anthonycumia.com, thank you for coming on the broadcast today.
[02:12:00.374 --> 02:12:02.035]  I've thrown a lot of stuff out there.
[02:12:02.035 --> 02:12:06.218]  You're welcome, though, to just wildcard any other subject you want to bring up.
[02:12:06.218 --> 02:12:09.321]  The NSA, Rand Paul, whatever you want to cover.
[02:12:09.941 --> 02:12:15.463]  I love it, but I think first and foremost you should know I am not with the Opie and Anthony Show anymore.
[02:12:15.463 --> 02:12:17.183]  Well, I knew you had your own big show.
[02:12:17.183 --> 02:12:18.824]  I can't keep track of all this stuff.
[02:12:18.824 --> 02:12:23.565]  I was summarily dismissed for some tweets that I made back in last July.
[02:12:23.565 --> 02:12:24.545]  Well, I apologize.
[02:12:24.545 --> 02:12:27.006]  It just shows I don't pay attention to a lot of entertainment stuff.
[02:12:27.006 --> 02:12:29.327]  But I like your show because you do cover some serious stuff.
[02:12:29.327 --> 02:12:30.507]  In fact, I've been on your show then.
[02:12:31.067 --> 02:12:47.432]  Yes, we're on this show and I gotta say, you know, talking about the media and the state of the media today, the fact that years ago, I've been in broadcasting for a while, and when people brought up Alex Jones, you'd get that, oh, that guy, oh, he talks about this and conspiracies.
[02:12:48.292 --> 02:12:51.395]  And I think the proof is in the pudding, as they say.
[02:12:51.395 --> 02:12:56.319]  A lot of what you talk about over the years has absolutely come to fruition.
[02:12:56.319 --> 02:13:03.965]  And that is the results that I think make people go, oh, so the mainstream media is full of crap.
[02:13:03.965 --> 02:13:13.373]  I do have to go to some of these what people would consider fringe broadcasters to actually get the truth and to see people going over
[02:13:14.033 --> 02:13:22.842]  To alternative type media and news shows is a glimmer of hope, I think, that we can look at.
[02:13:22.842 --> 02:13:36.235]  Because when I watch MSNBC and even Fox, who I have a lot of friends over there at Fox, and I do some of the shows over there every so often, but to watch that and see what they're shoveling to the public,
[02:13:37.215 --> 02:13:59.486]  It's disgraceful, but the technology these days allowing a lot of people that in the past wouldn't have that opportunity to do a news broadcast and put the truth out to people, and you've been doing it for years very well, I must say, is that light at the end of the tunnel I think that we're getting that maybe people, maybe,
[02:14:00.106 --> 02:14:14.967]  People, when they're informed and getting facts and actually able to make up their own minds about what they're hearing, not based on the truckload of manure that the mainstream media gives us, there might be hope for the future.
[02:14:15.675 --> 02:14:17.537]  And I apologize for getting all the shows confused.
[02:14:17.537 --> 02:14:19.739]  I know you've been doing a whole bunch of shows for years.
[02:14:19.739 --> 02:14:27.567]  In fact, you were syndicated on Terrestrial Radio, one of the most popular morning shows for a long time, even giving Howard Stern a run for his money.
[02:14:27.567 --> 02:14:32.712]  But then you ran into the FCC and got shut down just like he did.
[02:14:32.712 --> 02:14:36.796]  What do you think of the FCC and its secret plan and power grabbing the internet now?
[02:14:37.762 --> 02:14:42.125]  Well, yeah, I think they've left broadcasting in their wake now.
[02:14:42.125 --> 02:14:45.307]  They were the police of broadcasting for quite a while.
[02:14:45.307 --> 02:14:46.467]  We had run-ins with them.
[02:14:46.467 --> 02:14:51.210]  A lot of personality radio hosts had run-ins with the FCC.
[02:14:51.210 --> 02:14:53.311]  That was the big fear we had.
[02:14:53.311 --> 02:14:54.692]  Oh my God, are we going to get a complaint?
[02:14:54.692 --> 02:14:57.554]  Did we say anything against FCC regulations?
[02:14:57.554 --> 02:14:59.475]  Well, that's gone.
[02:14:59.475 --> 02:15:03.918]  The people that, real broadcasters in what they call real radio,
[02:15:04.238 --> 02:15:17.121]  are afraid of now is the public, is the Twitters and Facebooks and Instagrams and things that people will post that say, oh my God, you've offended people.
[02:15:17.121 --> 02:15:18.262]  You've said something bad.
[02:15:18.262 --> 02:15:19.662]  The FCC is a joke now.
[02:15:19.662 --> 02:15:21.623]  No one breaks the FCC rules.
[02:15:21.623 --> 02:15:26.464]  They don't even file complaints anymore for obscene language and such.
[02:15:26.464 --> 02:15:29.125]  They've gone on to bigger and better things.
[02:15:29.125 --> 02:15:30.445]  Yes, the Internet.
[02:15:32.046 --> 02:15:37.669]  We talked about net neutrality and how, don't worry, this is just to keep everything fair.
[02:15:37.669 --> 02:15:44.594]  Whenever a government agency jumps in to keep something fair, you know you are getting screwed.
[02:15:44.594 --> 02:15:55.340]  And if you think for a second, as with broadcasting, initially the FCC was brought in to maintain frequencies and power of the stations.
[02:15:55.340 --> 02:15:58.062]  Is the transmitter within legal parameters?
[02:15:58.382 --> 02:16:03.585]  And then all of a sudden they start going, well, maybe we should start looking at content.
[02:16:03.585 --> 02:16:06.427]  And it should or shouldn't go over our airwaves.
[02:16:06.427 --> 02:16:15.752]  If people don't think that that's what they'll do with the internet, they're insane, blind, and do not see what their whole program has been in the past.
[02:16:16.431 --> 02:16:17.832]  Well, what about Chris Pratt?
[02:16:17.832 --> 02:16:27.821]  The actor had to come out and apologize because feminist groups complained that the new Jurassic Park movie had traditional gender roles and showed a man as a hero.
[02:16:27.821 --> 02:16:30.183]  I mean, I'm sure you've noticed every new movie
[02:16:31.294 --> 02:16:33.635]  The men are bad, the women are the heroes.
[02:16:33.635 --> 02:16:37.797]  And look, I don't care if you put women in hero roles, Sigourney Weaver, whatever.
[02:16:37.797 --> 02:16:41.838]  Everybody knows that women and men want to go watch men as action heroes.
[02:16:41.838 --> 02:16:43.059]  It's always been that way.
[02:16:43.059 --> 02:16:46.901]  So it's this attempt to just muscle in and take over reality.
[02:16:46.901 --> 02:16:48.301]  That doesn't sound liberal to me.
[02:16:48.301 --> 02:16:49.862]  It sounds totalitarian.
[02:16:49.862 --> 02:16:57.365]  And then he rolled over and prostrated himself apologizing that he showed a man in a good role.
[02:16:57.365 --> 02:16:59.426]  I mean, what planet are we on here?
[02:17:01.692 --> 02:17:16.244]  The apology is going to be to the 2000s, 2010s, is going to be what the Hula Hoop and Pet Rock were to the 70s and whatnot.
[02:17:16.244 --> 02:17:23.751]  I hope someday we look back and think how ridiculous all of these apologies were when they were happening.
[02:17:24.051 --> 02:17:33.794]  Yes, I've seen preemptive apologies, where someone thinking someone might be offended in the future has apologized preemptively.
[02:17:33.794 --> 02:17:35.155]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[02:17:35.155 --> 02:17:46.639]  When a man and a woman on a traditional date go to see a film, and I think this is the majority of people, they want to see traditional values and traditional storylines in movies.
[02:17:46.639 --> 02:17:52.761]  And a small minority is always the squeaky wheel that makes people think this is what everyone wants.
[02:17:53.101 --> 02:17:56.463]  And that's crap!
[02:17:56.463 --> 02:17:58.164]  Sure, like you brought up Sigourney Weaver.
[02:17:58.164 --> 02:17:59.224]  That was alien.
[02:17:59.224 --> 02:18:01.925]  And that was in the late 70s.
[02:18:01.925 --> 02:18:03.826]  And she was a hero and it was fantastic.
[02:18:03.826 --> 02:18:04.887]  What a great movie.
[02:18:04.887 --> 02:18:15.252]  But it doesn't mean that now any time a male is in that dominant role in a movie that it's somehow anti-feminism or misogynistic.
[02:18:16.232 --> 02:18:22.734]  We're listening these days because of social media and that everyone has a voice now.
[02:18:22.734 --> 02:18:31.097]  We are listening to the small minority make these decisions and speaking for the majority of people and getting it completely wrong.
[02:18:31.097 --> 02:18:36.739]  Yeah, so the tail wagging the dog, Anthony Cumia, his own show, anthonycumia.com.
[02:18:36.739 --> 02:18:41.341]  Tell us about your own broadcast slash radio that you're doing right now, because I know I've heard it on the radio.
[02:18:41.341 --> 02:18:42.241]  Yeah.
[02:18:42.241 --> 02:18:44.962]  Tell us about that and then tell us what you want to cover when we come back.
[02:18:45.751 --> 02:18:47.312]  It's fantastic.
[02:18:47.312 --> 02:18:49.054]  I've never had the freedom.
[02:18:49.054 --> 02:19:06.487]  I've been in broadcasting for about 20 years and never had the freedom that I have now on anthonycumia.com to cover controversial topics in real language with real guests that speak openly and without this fear of repercussions that we all have now.
[02:19:06.687 --> 02:19:12.490]  We've talked about freedom of speech and, you know, oh, the First Amendment's the most important thing.
[02:19:12.490 --> 02:19:15.731]  And I'm not even talking about government agencies taking away our freedom of speech.
[02:19:15.731 --> 02:19:18.112]  We have the people.
[02:19:18.112 --> 02:19:23.795]  It's the guy next door, the person... Let's talk about that when we come back because that's one of the topics.
[02:19:24.495 --> 02:19:28.038]  That's one of the first topics I wanted to raise with you is I don't hate Muslims.
[02:19:28.038 --> 02:19:29.479]  I'm not some bigot.
[02:19:29.479 --> 02:19:37.746]  I get most Muslims aren't radical, but there is a big segment that basically are like stone age, you know, crazy barbarians.
[02:19:37.746 --> 02:19:41.450]  I mean, you know, mutilating women, murdering Christians.
[02:19:41.450 --> 02:19:45.773]  And then we're not supposed to be able to draw pictures of Muhammad or they're going to come kill us.
[02:19:45.773 --> 02:19:48.355]  And now the left says we have to ban free speech.
[02:19:49.136 --> 02:19:53.200]  To accommodate these outsiders, that's the inverse of free speech.
[02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:57.285]  So I want to talk about irreverence being at the heart of a free society straight ahead.
[02:19:59.921 --> 02:20:04.364]  So Mark and I were talking about these looters, you know, in Baltimore and in Ferguson.
[02:20:04.364 --> 02:20:07.867]  Seems like every time there's some kind of an upset, the looters come out.
[02:20:07.867 --> 02:20:10.549]  And I'm thinking to myself, you know, I'm a small business guy.
[02:20:10.549 --> 02:20:12.430]  Mark's a small business guy.
[02:20:12.430 --> 02:20:17.113]  And we go to Guns80.com and we get our AR-15 kits.
[02:20:17.113 --> 02:20:19.235]  And we get our 30-shot magazines.
[02:20:19.235 --> 02:20:21.917]  And we're ready for the looters if you get my drift.
[02:20:21.917 --> 02:20:22.658]  Hello.
[02:20:22.658 --> 02:20:24.599]  Don't wait for the powers that be.

[02:23:28.024 --> 02:23:37.326]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:23:37.326 --> 02:23:38.106]  This capitalism?
[02:23:38.106 --> 02:23:44.268]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:23:44.268 --> 02:23:47.969]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:23:47.969 --> 02:23:48.929]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:23:48.929 --> 02:23:49.969]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:23:49.969 --> 02:23:50.289]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:50.289 --> 02:23:50.629]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:24:14.584 --> 02:24:25.786]  Anthony Cumia is our guest, pioneer in talk radio, alternative talk radio, shock talk I guess you could call it, but I've been on multiple shows that he hosts, and he's a pretty smart guy.
[02:24:25.786 --> 02:24:35.989]  I mean, I enjoy listening to him when I'm on his show, or the few times I've heard it on Sirius XM, because again, I'm so busy, I don't have time to tune into a lot of entertainment media.
[02:24:35.989 --> 02:24:41.650]  I've really tried to direct my crew to do that more, because that's where the real battle for hearts and minds is happening.
[02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:49.416]  That's why you turn on the TV and Obama's on almost every show now or his wife or Republicans.
[02:24:49.416 --> 02:24:54.921]  But that's because their propaganda isn't as effective as it once was.
[02:24:54.921 --> 02:25:07.712]  So I believe they're going to use violence that people respond to speech with as an excuse to say, you better not say that or somebody might get violent.
[02:25:07.712 --> 02:25:09.734]  And that's how they've banned a lot of free speech in Europe.
[02:25:10.509 --> 02:25:17.482]  Now I don't support, I don't like anti-Muslim rallies in Europe, you know, saying kick all the Muslims out.
[02:25:17.482 --> 02:25:21.009]  But they shouldn't be banned in France and Germany as they've been.
[02:25:21.823 --> 02:25:22.864]  And it's the same thing.
[02:25:22.864 --> 02:25:27.407]  I don't like people coming to my country telling me I don't have free speech.
[02:25:27.407 --> 02:25:29.648]  Look at Saudi Arabia.
[02:25:29.648 --> 02:25:38.634]  You go there and you say a cuss word or you give somebody a Playboy or on the other side give somebody a Bible, you're going to get life in prison, maybe executed.
[02:25:38.634 --> 02:25:41.736]  There's never any criticism of that by the left.
[02:25:41.736 --> 02:25:43.317]  Anthony, that's another point.
[02:25:43.317 --> 02:25:47.200]  The so-called left, and I'm not left-wing or right-wing, but the left
[02:25:48.524 --> 02:25:59.068]  Seems to be so authoritarian now, with all their free speech garbage, and they never complain about China is banning women showing cleavage.
[02:25:59.068 --> 02:26:08.312]  So they're going the Saudi Arabian route, but then meanwhile, in America, a man having any success is somehow inherently something evil.
[02:26:08.312 --> 02:26:15.855]  It really just seems like it's an anti-man thing, not about empowering women, and then why would the political system want to develop something like that?
[02:26:16.769 --> 02:26:27.904]  Yeah, I'll just add that to the ever-increasing hypocrisies that we see from the left, the progressive left, which is such a joke now to even call them progressive.
[02:26:27.904 --> 02:26:31.650]  They are more totalitarian than anything right now.
[02:26:31.650 --> 02:26:33.833]  Yeah, they have really eliminated
[02:26:34.213 --> 02:26:37.255]  Freedom of speech through fear.
[02:26:37.255 --> 02:26:42.298]  We don't worry about an agency coming by and really taking our freedom of speech.
[02:26:42.298 --> 02:26:49.802]  That's easy to go and make public and make it look like, hey, they are infringing on our freedom of speech.
[02:26:49.802 --> 02:26:58.187]  But when we're doing it just as people saying, you can't say that because it's offensive, it's racist, it's homophobic, it's misogynistic.
[02:26:58.187 --> 02:27:00.308]  That's when people get petrified.
[02:27:00.848 --> 02:27:02.670]  Petrified of that scarlet letter.
[02:27:02.670 --> 02:27:05.352]  Which one is it going to be that's slapped on me?
[02:27:05.352 --> 02:27:08.595]  Did I say something bad about transgender people?
[02:27:08.595 --> 02:27:09.917]  Did I talk about Muslims?
[02:27:09.917 --> 02:27:14.901]  Did I say something about blacks in Ferguson or Baltimore?
[02:27:14.901 --> 02:27:16.503]  Oh my God, look out!
[02:27:16.503 --> 02:27:22.809]  That's the fear everyone has and it's an absolute infringement on your First Amendment right when the fear of
[02:27:23.129 --> 02:27:29.172]  Ruining your reputation, losing your job, your family's maybe in danger because of it.
[02:27:29.172 --> 02:27:31.633]  It's happened and that's what we're looking at.
[02:27:31.633 --> 02:27:41.058]  It's the new infringement on our freedom of speech is this and a bunch of little rats running around called the American public.
[02:27:41.058 --> 02:27:49.242]  We're doing the job that Orwell thought that the government would be doing when in sense we're all just ratting on ourselves now.
[02:27:49.744 --> 02:27:55.990]  Sure, it's like you see these articles every day where the nine-year-old played in the park across the street, so the child's been taken.
[02:27:55.990 --> 02:27:57.351]  A neighbor called.
[02:27:57.351 --> 02:27:59.893]  What's the law that your kid can't play in a park?
[02:27:59.893 --> 02:28:02.215]  Well, they just call it endangerment.
[02:28:02.215 --> 02:28:04.117]  You know, what you're doing, I think, is the answer.
[02:28:04.117 --> 02:28:11.623]  No matter what somebody's political views are, if more of us that are outspoken, who support free speech, start our own podcast, our own radio shows,
[02:28:12.705 --> 02:28:18.842]  Then that's the answer to all the control freaks, is to battle them with true Americana culture.
[02:28:18.842 --> 02:28:20.927]  Tell folks about the system you've launched.
[02:28:21.650 --> 02:28:22.870]  This is great.
[02:28:22.870 --> 02:28:24.471]  It's anthonycumbia.com.
[02:28:24.471 --> 02:28:26.931]  It's unlike what we're seeing here on Skype.
[02:28:26.931 --> 02:28:28.011]  It's HD video.
[02:28:28.011 --> 02:28:36.673]  I mean, we have a lot of guests on the show that I don't necessarily agree with.
[02:28:36.673 --> 02:28:43.475]  I had a gun control advocate on the show and we went off talking about guns and crime and whatnot.
[02:28:43.475 --> 02:28:48.736]  But in open and honest forum, something that is very rare these days.
[02:28:49.016 --> 02:28:59.809]  And do you think it's a coincidence that right when the technology is available for a lot of people to do their own broadcasts and get things out there, that all of a sudden the government wants to start regulating the internet?
[02:28:59.809 --> 02:29:02.372]  You think that's a coincidence?
[02:29:02.372 --> 02:29:02.973]  No, it's not.
[02:29:02.973 --> 02:29:08.539]  I mean, notice we're told get ready for imminent terror attacks right when they're trying to reauthorize the Patriot Act.
[02:29:08.539 --> 02:29:09.060]  Exactly.
[02:29:11.110 --> 02:29:12.451]  A long segment's coming up.
[02:29:12.451 --> 02:29:13.351]  We break here in a moment.
[02:29:13.351 --> 02:29:17.053]  I want to come back and get into where you think the media will be in 10 years.
[02:29:17.053 --> 02:29:19.394]  I mean, obviously, nobody has a crystal ball.
[02:29:19.394 --> 02:29:23.016]  And then I want to shift into a topic I know you talk a lot about, and that's the police.
[02:29:23.016 --> 02:29:28.299]  I mean, the biggest story in the country, month after month, is the police.
[02:29:28.299 --> 02:29:32.421]  And so I want to get your take on what you think's behind that and where you think that's going as well.
[02:29:33.321 --> 02:29:42.067]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show, simulcasting on the internet at InfoWars.com forward slash show, and on stations across the country.
[02:29:42.067 --> 02:29:44.249]  So we are radio, that's also television.
[02:29:44.249 --> 02:29:48.772]  Check it out, InfoWars.com forward slash show, and share that link with friends and family.
[02:29:48.772 --> 02:29:52.675]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.675 --> 02:29:55.357]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.488 --> 02:30:05.276]  Well, it looks like the Justice Department wants to ban more Americans from owning guns.
[02:30:05.276 --> 02:30:16.572]  That's right, President Barack Hussein Obama is proposing new firearm regulations that will revoke gun rights from those the government declares to be mentally unfit.
[02:30:16.912 --> 02:30:32.075]  And that's a scary thought considering the fact that the official diagnostic system for mental disorders in the US, the DSM-5, is so broad that almost every form of human behavior can be diagnosed as some type of mental illness.
[02:30:32.415 --> 02:30:37.637]  For example, in 2012, the Department of Veteran Affairs sent out letters to U.S.
[02:30:37.637 --> 02:30:43.059]  military veterans to inform them that their competence levels were under review.
[02:30:43.059 --> 02:30:52.262]  If the federal government rated them incompetent, they would be prohibited from purchasing, possessing, receiving, or transporting a firearm or even ammo.
[02:30:52.262 --> 02:30:57.824]  For more details on this story, plus all the day's breaking news, go to InfoWars.com.

[02:31:39.517 --> 02:31:43.319]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[02:32:11.571 --> 02:32:22.434]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality, or because they're not 100% organic, or because they don't
[02:32:22.694 --> 02:32:28.416]  Ask all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:28.416 --> 02:32:39.320]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shields, oxy powder, I believe.
[02:32:39.500 --> 02:32:40.040]  We're good.
[02:33:09.890 --> 02:33:12.510]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:12.510 --> 02:33:21.312]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:21.312 --> 02:33:36.935]  Anthony Cumia, a trailblazer in new media, is our guest, and I always enjoy talking to folks that were successful in their own right, not through the establishment system.
[02:33:40.421 --> 02:33:45.844]  Look, I've got to be honest with you, I don't follow Kim Kardashian or who her stepdad is.
[02:33:45.844 --> 02:33:55.889]  I know one of the sisters came out and was worried about geoengineering the other day, so when I can get some of these high-peds to focus on some real issues, we love it.
[02:33:55.889 --> 02:34:05.934]  But I guess their stepdad is like the last white guy to win a triathlon or whatever, or decathlon, I guess, at the Olympics.
[02:34:08.001 --> 02:34:11.143]  And I remember hearing about his transformation to a woman.
[02:34:11.143 --> 02:34:14.826]  It's the front page of DrugsReport.com.
[02:34:14.826 --> 02:34:19.108]  Miss America, call me Caitlin.
[02:34:19.108 --> 02:34:21.790]  And listen, I think that Bradley Manning is a hero.
[02:34:21.790 --> 02:34:25.212]  It's Chelsea Manning now.
[02:34:25.212 --> 02:34:27.094]  It's good that he exposed war crimes.
[02:34:27.094 --> 02:34:29.375]  It's good he exposed some of the stuff that was going on.
[02:34:29.375 --> 02:34:34.919]  But at the same time, we're supposed to then obsess all day over the fact that he thinks he's a woman.
[02:34:36.095 --> 02:34:37.736]  Here's all I'm saying.
[02:34:37.736 --> 02:34:42.400]  Why is the only story I ever seem to hear about anywhere is men becoming women?
[02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:45.163]  And I understand it's interesting and people like to talk about it.
[02:34:45.163 --> 02:34:49.206]  I'm doing it right now, but China is threatening nuclear war with the U.S.
[02:34:49.206 --> 02:34:52.469]  in their official daily Chinese government newspaper.
[02:34:52.469 --> 02:34:54.331]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[02:34:54.331 --> 02:34:58.794]  They're building islands with artillery to stop the ships coming through.
[02:34:58.794 --> 02:35:01.437]  Obama, by executive power, has just opened the border up.
[02:35:03.697 --> 02:35:08.758]  With Cook numbers, we've got 0.2% growth levels.
[02:35:08.758 --> 02:35:13.459]  We've got just all this craziness going on.
[02:35:13.459 --> 02:35:16.420]  And you'd think none of that matters in the world.
[02:35:16.420 --> 02:35:22.541]  As Obama prepares executive orders to restrict the Second Amendment, that could cause a civil war.
[02:35:22.541 --> 02:35:26.582]  And look at this, Miss America, if you're a TV viewer, you can click on it.
[02:35:26.582 --> 02:35:28.002]  And it's these photo shoots.
[02:35:30.465 --> 02:35:35.010]  And it's some old guy with makeup all over him dressed up like a woman.
[02:35:35.010 --> 02:35:40.576]  I mean, at least get a guy that looks like a woman if you're going to put him and make him look like this.
[02:35:40.576 --> 02:35:42.638]  This is ridiculous!
[02:35:42.638 --> 02:35:44.580]  Now it's a creepy old guy like a woman?
[02:35:44.580 --> 02:35:49.044]  I mean, it's just force-feeding weirdness.
[02:35:49.044 --> 02:35:50.306]  And when I've studied history,
[02:35:51.633 --> 02:35:53.994]  These people say, oh, you just are a bigot.
[02:35:53.994 --> 02:35:56.974]  No, I personally don't care what somebody does in their own time.
[02:35:56.974 --> 02:36:04.856]  It's that I don't like being force-fed constantly this weird one agenda, the obsession.
[02:36:04.856 --> 02:36:20.120]  It's gotta be for like five, six years, because I cover media with trainees and transvestites just constantly force-feeding it, shoving it down my throat, pun intended, as if it's the only thing in the universe, the only thing in the world, what's behind the agenda?
[02:36:21.443 --> 02:36:28.387]  I know I'm kind of digressing off what I said we'd come back with police brutality and that whole crisis and where that's going but here are the two big twin stories.
[02:36:28.387 --> 02:36:39.254]  The police are evil and the coolest thing to be is a trainee or a transvestite or to totally have your genitals removed and taxpayers will pay for it.
[02:36:39.254 --> 02:36:39.894]  I mean is that what
[02:36:40.114 --> 02:36:53.964]  What we're going to be known as in the future is not space exploration, not, you know, inventing a cure for cancer, but how cool it is to dress up in drag or to take hormones and, oh look, I'm a woman.
[02:36:53.964 --> 02:36:56.766]  And then you see the women are acting like men, the men are acting like women.
[02:36:56.766 --> 02:37:01.689]  And I mean, I'm kind of just ranting here just because I don't know what to make of it.
[02:37:01.689 --> 02:37:03.431]  What do you think's happening here, Anthony?
[02:37:05.394 --> 02:37:08.877]  Well, I see a lot of distractions.
[02:37:08.877 --> 02:37:11.439]  I see a lot of distractions being thrown out there.
[02:37:11.439 --> 02:37:16.904]  The dumbing down of the American people through the mass media.
[02:37:16.904 --> 02:37:19.286]  And this is just a prime example.
[02:37:19.286 --> 02:37:25.131]  You brought up some very important subjects that are happening right now.
[02:37:25.131 --> 02:37:30.215]  Earlier today, I saw that there was a Russian jet buzzing American ships.
[02:37:31.316 --> 02:37:34.097]  Out at sea, and just nothing.
[02:37:34.097 --> 02:37:35.438]  We don't talk about it.
[02:37:35.438 --> 02:37:36.078]  We don't hear about it.
[02:37:36.078 --> 02:37:43.241]  We want to hear about, yeah, the Kardashians and this man-woman.
[02:37:43.241 --> 02:37:47.783]  I've gotten that sent to me probably 50 times today, that picture.
[02:37:47.783 --> 02:37:55.306]  And nothing about what the real important issues are in this country and to the American people.
[02:37:55.306 --> 02:37:56.407]  And it is a dumbing down.
[02:37:56.807 --> 02:38:10.371]  I think it goes hand in hand with what the subject that we were going to talk about, a virtual police state localized as of yet in a few of these cities, which I think is kind of a test run.
[02:38:10.371 --> 02:38:22.854]  I think in Boston with the Boston bombing at the Marathon, we saw a very successful test run of how the police would be greeted with open arms by the people given the right emergency.
[02:38:25.055 --> 02:38:26.535]  It is dangerous.
[02:38:26.535 --> 02:38:39.318]  And again, all they have to do is sprinkle the news and social media takes off with it with some Bruce Jenner as a woman and Kardashians and Nicki Minaj and all the rest, Kanye.
[02:38:39.318 --> 02:38:41.338]  And we don't just don't seem to care.
[02:38:41.338 --> 02:38:49.020]  We just sit there and accept it and and watch the pretty pictures and do nothing about it.
[02:38:50.882 --> 02:38:55.366]  Well, I agree with you, and it's a complex issue on the police.
[02:38:55.366 --> 02:39:02.633]  On one hand, George Soros and others want to make all anger at the government be distracted, as you said, into police themselves.
[02:39:02.633 --> 02:39:10.300]  We've let the culture get this way, we've let the training get this way, we've let society degenerate so police get fearful, so then they militarize the feds.
[02:39:10.300 --> 02:39:12.322]  Give them all the weapons, give them the training,
[02:39:13.243 --> 02:39:24.015]  Then when there's problems, as Al Sharpton said, they want to federalize the police as if that's going to make it better and standardize it so it's classic Hegelian dialectic of problem, reaction, solution.
[02:39:24.015 --> 02:39:31.544]  My point is, we need to reach out to police, take back our communities, change it from within, not with federalization.
[02:39:31.544 --> 02:39:32.244]  I really think
[02:39:33.223 --> 02:39:44.941]  That some of the people in government do want to have some type of moderate, slow-motion civil war in this country, out of which they can then bring in the real police state.
[02:39:46.109 --> 02:39:53.994]  Yeah, it's more like a chess game than this fast-moving revolution that we see.
[02:39:53.994 --> 02:40:10.784]  I think people in power do think three or four moves ahead and will cause an emergency, make it look very desperate, so that we as the people beg them to come in and help us.
[02:40:10.784 --> 02:40:14.547]  The authorities, whether it be the police or the federal government,
[02:40:14.947 --> 02:40:18.312]  Never come in and say, we're going to take this from you.
[02:40:18.312 --> 02:40:19.593]  It just, it wouldn't happen.
[02:40:19.593 --> 02:40:22.197]  It's very difficult for them to do that.
[02:40:22.197 --> 02:40:28.505]  Because people have this very limited, but somewhat of an understanding of what some of their rights are.
[02:40:28.505 --> 02:40:30.367]  So they make a problem.
[02:40:30.367 --> 02:40:32.971]  And then you beg them to come in and help you.
[02:40:33.291 --> 02:40:34.011]  They're just helping.
[02:40:34.011 --> 02:40:35.532]  They're not taking away your rights.
[02:40:35.532 --> 02:40:39.913]  They're protecting your freedom and protecting your safety.
[02:40:39.913 --> 02:40:47.815]  So you have to be able to look at how many moves ahead they're planning on doing to see what their ultimate goal is.
[02:40:47.815 --> 02:40:52.096]  And if you talk like this too much, people say you sound like a nut.
[02:40:52.096 --> 02:40:54.877]  You sound like you're paranoid about the government.
[02:40:55.237 --> 02:41:03.185]  But past performance is indeed indicative of what we're going to see them doing in the future.
[02:41:03.185 --> 02:41:10.892]  It's frightening, and what's more frightening is the lack of awareness that the people have, but they know Bruce Jenner wants to be a woman.
[02:41:12.250 --> 02:41:13.510]  And that's easy for him.
[02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:19.752]  And again, my issue is there's no need to be teaching my children about Bruce Jenner and how to become a woman.
[02:41:19.752 --> 02:41:24.513]  I mean, what is the state doing wanting to be involved with our children?
[02:41:24.513 --> 02:41:25.894]  It's totally creepy.
[02:41:25.894 --> 02:41:27.314]  It's totally weird.
[02:41:27.314 --> 02:41:28.434]  And it's my taste.
[02:41:28.434 --> 02:41:29.415]  It's not discrimination.
[02:41:29.415 --> 02:41:40.958]  It's my taste that I'm sick of having a weird, creepy man with big hands, with liver spots all over him, with a bunch of people fawning, combing their hair like it's Marilyn Monroe.
[02:41:41.838 --> 02:41:45.543]  I'm worried about the elite, what they put on pedestals.
[02:41:45.543 --> 02:41:48.726]  I mean, it's just, it's just bizarre.
[02:41:48.726 --> 02:41:53.812]  Like, why didn't they get a man that looked like a woman and was at least attractive is what I'm getting at.
[02:41:53.812 --> 02:41:55.534]  Why was it something ugly?
[02:41:55.534 --> 02:41:58.197]  Why do they want to... There's something there.
[02:41:58.197 --> 02:41:59.920]  It's twisted.
[02:41:59.920 --> 02:42:01.642]  I think it's more than just a distraction.
[02:42:02.319 --> 02:42:06.643]  Alex, what you're saying, ugly, you know, it's in the eye of the beholder.
[02:42:06.643 --> 02:42:11.386]  You're being very, very negative here and offensive.
[02:42:11.386 --> 02:42:12.567]  And bigoted, bigoted!
[02:42:12.567 --> 02:42:16.070]  I'm saying I don't like old men in drag.
[02:42:16.070 --> 02:42:16.951]  So bigoted.
[02:42:16.951 --> 02:42:23.836]  You know, you used to be able to raise your children as per your values and your morality.
[02:42:23.836 --> 02:42:27.620]  Now that's some type of crime, I gather, and you're teaching hate
[02:42:28.380 --> 02:42:34.722]  If you don't teach this all-encompassing tolerance that we're all supposed to have.
[02:42:34.722 --> 02:42:42.364]  Your own ethics and morality has no place in your child's life.
[02:42:42.364 --> 02:42:48.226]  Your child's to be raised by what society deems acceptable now.
[02:42:48.226 --> 02:42:56.729]  And if it's Bruce Jenner in a dress with makeup on his face, you have no right telling your kids that that isn't completely fine.
[02:42:57.130 --> 02:42:59.795]  Or you're just teaching hate?
[02:42:59.795 --> 02:43:02.802]  Well, I just wonder what future we're gonna have as a country.
[02:43:02.802 --> 02:43:04.144]  I mean, China...
[02:43:05.834 --> 02:43:11.478]  They chain their kids up by the millions, literally, when they go to work at the big factories.
[02:43:11.478 --> 02:43:13.579]  There's video and newscasts that show this.
[02:43:13.579 --> 02:43:18.983]  If you're a listener and don't believe it, just type in China, you know, children chained during work.
[02:43:18.983 --> 02:43:19.964]  And I'm not saying that's a good thing.
[02:43:19.964 --> 02:43:20.504]  It's terrible.
[02:43:20.504 --> 02:43:27.269]  But suicide nets, drugging of the workers, you know, 15-hour workdays.
[02:43:27.269 --> 02:43:34.874]  How will we compete with something like that when our gross domestic product is going to be men learning how to put dresses on?
[02:43:37.321 --> 02:44:00.030]  Yeah, you know, you look back and again, I'll be criticized for waxing fantastic about the good old days, but I don't know, when you look back and look at our achievements in the space program, look at our achievements when, you know, we fought in those good wars and the amazing bravery of our soldiers and the
[02:44:00.330 --> 02:44:12.377]  The victories we've had, all the innovation that has come out of this country, and the amazing technology that we have available to us because of those brilliant minds and the work ethic.
[02:44:12.377 --> 02:44:12.677]  That's it.
[02:44:12.677 --> 02:44:14.999]  We used to innovate and lead the world.
[02:44:14.999 --> 02:44:18.140]  Now, I mean, our flag is not a guy in a dress.
[02:44:18.140 --> 02:44:20.322]  I mean, it just isn't the flag of a country.
[02:44:21.032 --> 02:44:23.413]  We're not seeing any of that anymore.
[02:44:23.413 --> 02:44:26.435]  I don't know what we're doing as a country anymore.
[02:44:26.435 --> 02:44:32.458]  We have to hitch rides to a space station that we paid a hell of a lot into.
[02:44:32.458 --> 02:44:34.018]  On Russian rockets.
[02:44:34.018 --> 02:44:37.160]  On Russian rockets because we don't have a program.
[02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:39.901]  To bring our own astronauts up there anymore?
[02:44:39.901 --> 02:44:41.321]  That's disgraceful.
[02:44:41.321 --> 02:44:44.863]  And for anyone that says, well, we got our own problems down here.
[02:44:44.863 --> 02:44:59.889]  If you look at all the innovations that came from the American space program, at things that we use today, the amazing technologies we have that came from the space program, it's very, it's very, put the blinders on to think that it's just, let's go up there and prove we're big shots.
[02:44:59.889 --> 02:45:01.509]  We're not doing this anymore.
[02:45:01.509 --> 02:45:05.571]  And it's showing in our society and in the American civilization.
[02:45:05.951 --> 02:45:06.751]  That's it.
[02:45:06.751 --> 02:45:08.772]  I mean, I'm tolerant, I'm open.
[02:45:08.772 --> 02:45:13.554]  In fact, I hate even having to say that, because quite frankly, I'm just not paying attention to all this weirdness.
[02:45:13.554 --> 02:45:22.717]  It wants to force its infantile, weird mindset into my life, and then it criticizes any innovation, any pro-human
[02:45:23.877 --> 02:45:25.738]  I think it's... I've got the answer.
[02:45:54.257 --> 02:46:07.844]  It's not the cliche of each generation gets dumber, I don't believe that, but because of the smartphones, the culture, the short attention span, the IQs are dropping, I really think we're going to hit rock bottom very soon, Anthony, and I'm worried about what's going to happen when we do.
[02:46:07.844 --> 02:46:19.930]  I mean, imagine if we have another Great Depression, with the majority of people not knowing how to take care of themselves, what it will look like with 100 million people on food assistance, Anthony.
[02:46:21.545 --> 02:46:35.428]  I couldn't imagine, even years ago I would bring up the, I couldn't imagine what American refugees would look like, streaming over some border to find some kind of safety or food or water, depending on what the emergency was here.
[02:46:35.428 --> 02:46:48.991]  I just couldn't imagine a line of people complaining that their heels hurt or that their suit was dirty or just, we don't have this instinct to survive and to innovate and to kind of adapt.
[02:46:50.271 --> 02:46:51.752]  And I want to be clear.
[02:47:13.510 --> 02:47:15.372]  I don't claim to be some tough guy.
[02:47:15.372 --> 02:47:21.258]  I mean, my dad's dad and my mom's dad were both Army Air Corps guys in World War II.
[02:47:21.258 --> 02:47:23.401]  They were both really hard working.
[02:47:23.401 --> 02:47:26.844]  They didn't act like tough guys, but they were tough guys.
[02:47:26.844 --> 02:47:31.529]  And my dad's dad could do electrical, fix the combine, fix the well.
[02:47:32.530 --> 02:47:36.813]  Then he could go be in, you know, county government on top of that and help poor people.
[02:47:36.813 --> 02:47:39.255]  And it was just a really cool manly man.
[02:47:39.255 --> 02:47:47.620]  And now I think back to images of my dad's dad, and I look at my dad and then me, and I can see the degeneration from him.
[02:47:47.620 --> 02:47:50.482]  And I think, oh my God.
[02:47:50.482 --> 02:47:56.526]  And so much of it is just the way the modern world is has removed us from the land.
[02:47:56.526 --> 02:47:58.307]  So we're artificial.
[02:47:58.307 --> 02:48:00.609]  And I think so many of the people in the establishment
[02:48:01.405 --> 02:48:01.625]  Right.
[02:48:01.625 --> 02:48:02.105]  Uh, it's, it's...
[02:48:24.910 --> 02:48:27.051]  I don't consider myself a tough guy either.
[02:48:27.051 --> 02:48:39.936]  I mean, but I think the goal of people that came before us in this country was to make it a little easier for the next generation, but not so easy to that where literally men cannot change a flat tire anymore.
[02:48:39.936 --> 02:48:41.596]  It's just they can't do it.
[02:48:41.596 --> 02:48:45.518]  And that's one of the most simple things that a man is supposed to be able to do.
[02:48:45.518 --> 02:48:46.258]  I think again
[02:48:47.658 --> 02:48:55.221]  Some of the technologies that we've got, and of course this little gadget, has changed the way we live as a society.
[02:48:55.221 --> 02:49:09.867]  And I think we're chirping and hollering about how great it is, but we don't really, we aren't looking in the future to see how it's affecting us as people, and how we don't really face-to-face talk to each other anymore.
[02:49:09.867 --> 02:49:13.668]  We don't, if something was important to you and you wanted to learn more about it,
[02:49:13.968 --> 02:49:19.133]  You really have to work to go somewhere to find that information or learn how to do something.
[02:49:19.133 --> 02:49:25.158]  Now it's intertwined with, well, I'm kind of interested in this, but also, look, there's a man dressed like a woman.
[02:49:25.158 --> 02:49:26.539]  We're back to that again.
[02:49:26.539 --> 02:49:27.660]  It's distracting.
[02:49:27.660 --> 02:49:28.501]  Well, this is a great talk.
[02:49:28.501 --> 02:49:29.162]  You just said it!
[02:49:29.901 --> 02:49:39.387]  We now have access to more information than anybody ever did before at our fingertips, every library in the world, and now we don't appreciate it because there's so much of it.
[02:49:39.387 --> 02:49:40.227]  It's that paradox.
[02:49:40.227 --> 02:49:46.271]  So, in your gut, is it going to get a lot worse before it gets better, and are we going to make it as a species?
[02:49:46.271 --> 02:49:49.493]  I am so cynical when I see what's happening.
[02:49:49.493 --> 02:49:51.794]  I think it will get a lot worse before it gets
[02:49:54.482 --> 02:50:02.608]  We're looking at a time in history where technology, such as the smartphones, changes civilization.
[02:50:02.608 --> 02:50:06.750]  Like those crossroads at like, wow, all right, we have air travel.
[02:50:06.750 --> 02:50:09.912]  Air travel changed civilization as we know it.
[02:50:09.912 --> 02:50:11.794]  This is doing that.
[02:50:11.794 --> 02:50:14.656]  But we don't know where it's going to take us.
[02:50:14.656 --> 02:50:19.119]  But I guarantee you, we are not seeing the good old days anymore.
[02:50:19.119 --> 02:50:23.762]  We'll just have to hope the future brings something that's a little better than what I'm seeing right now.
[02:50:24.122 --> 02:50:27.964]  Anthony, I gotta have you back on more because I'm not just saying this kissing your butt.
[02:50:27.964 --> 02:50:32.626]  You've really helped me just bouncing back and forth, crystallize so much what I've been trying to get at.
[02:50:32.626 --> 02:50:44.692]  I, just as a guy that's built a company, a father, three children, you know, both sides of my family have been somewhat successful in business, whatever, you know, just try to be a good guy, try to build a better world, try to make it better for my kids.
[02:50:44.692 --> 02:50:49.734]  I see how trying to do everything for my kids has made them kind of spoiled, so now I'm kind of reversing that.
[02:50:49.734 --> 02:50:51.615]  But then I look at the whole society
[02:50:52.435 --> 02:51:12.440]  And I think it's just that we have angst wanting to let folks know and warn people that we are to fork in the road, that we kind of are choosing our own adventure right now, and if some of these roads lead somewhere really scary, that's a normal instinct to want to know how the world works, to want to be involved, to want to
[02:51:13.360 --> 02:51:23.488]  Have your own freedom to want to stop special interests that are totalitarian, and they've conditioned the public that that's bad or evil to have a survival instinct.
[02:51:23.488 --> 02:51:27.271]  And so I think really the world's split into two different groups of people, or three different.
[02:51:27.271 --> 02:51:31.074]  Those that want to build a better world, want to know how it works, want to inform others.
[02:51:31.074 --> 02:51:32.856]  Those that are lazy and don't care.
[02:51:32.856 --> 02:51:37.540]  And those that actually know what's going on, but want to feed on the giant dumb mass.
[02:51:37.540 --> 02:51:38.701]  And so I think the battle
[02:51:39.750 --> 02:51:54.174]  Is in between those three groups, and sometimes I think the giant mass of dumbed-down idiots is more dangerous than even the elite, because if you study history, giant herds of dumbed-down people are incredibly dangerous and are uncontrollable.
[02:51:54.174 --> 02:52:02.117]  I think the establishment, with their social engineering and stuff, has taken the easiest path, but I think down the road it's the worst path.
[02:52:03.001 --> 02:52:05.843]  We have, absolutely.
[02:52:05.843 --> 02:52:08.064]  You just have to glance back through history.
[02:52:08.064 --> 02:52:09.945]  You don't even have to go very far.
[02:52:09.945 --> 02:52:18.029]  To see a dumbed-down public that is a bit desperate is extremely dangerous to the entire world.
[02:52:18.029 --> 02:52:19.990]  And I think that's what we're seeing.
[02:52:19.990 --> 02:52:27.415]  As far as information goes, it's very difficult to weed out accurate information these days.
[02:52:27.415 --> 02:52:30.036]  And I think the powers that be enjoy that.
[02:52:30.036 --> 02:52:31.557]  They take advantage of it and love it.
[02:52:32.998 --> 02:52:47.584]  The distractions that are available when you're going to look for information is akin to try sitting in a library and studying something while there's clowns juggling and music playing and talking and freak shows going on.
[02:52:47.904 --> 02:52:49.266]  It would be very difficult.
[02:52:49.266 --> 02:52:51.608]  But that's virtually what we're doing.
[02:52:51.608 --> 02:52:53.170]  It's very hard to say.
[02:52:53.170 --> 02:53:03.922]  How many times have you tried to look something up and gone off on a tangent because other links are popping up or, you know, somebody calls you or texts you with something?
[02:53:03.922 --> 02:53:05.704]  It's very hard to concentrate.
[02:53:05.704 --> 02:53:05.944]  Sure.
[02:53:05.944 --> 02:53:07.486]  Our brains have been rewired.
[02:53:07.486 --> 02:53:09.048]  I mean, our brains have been rewired.
[02:53:09.048 --> 02:53:09.188]  Yeah.
[02:53:09.528 --> 02:53:19.695]  Rewired and the lack of attention span that we have today, the lack of just an interest in any one thing.
[02:53:19.695 --> 02:53:31.344]  We have to be all over the place, 24 hours a day, instead of really just settling in and looking at something, studying it, becoming knowledgeable about a subject.
[02:53:31.344 --> 02:53:32.605]  That's gone!
[02:53:32.605 --> 02:53:33.045]  It's gone!
[02:53:36.874 --> 02:53:41.119]  Mr. Cumia, that's been a very informative interview, very thought-provoking.
[02:53:41.119 --> 02:53:42.000]  Love it, Alex.
[02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:46.605]  Tell folks, again, when your different podcasts and radio shows air, how folks find those.
[02:53:47.624 --> 02:53:50.365]  It's easy, just go to anthonycumia.com.
[02:53:50.365 --> 02:53:55.907]  We're live every day, 4pm to 6pm on the East Coast.
[02:53:55.907 --> 02:54:02.429]  And again, open, honest, funny, provocative, just free!
[02:54:02.429 --> 02:54:04.109]  It's freedom!
[02:54:04.109 --> 02:54:11.932]  Finally able to voice opinions and yeah, people will get mad, but at least I don't have to worry that my boss is going to throw me out the door.
[02:54:13.012 --> 02:54:25.942]  Well, that's what is going to be the great equalizer, and that's why they want to censor the web and shut us down now, because people have gotten a taste for real freedom, which isn't left or right, it's just common sense, and people are going, wait, you mean there are shows that aren't left or right?
[02:54:25.942 --> 02:54:27.603]  They're just common sense?
[02:54:27.603 --> 02:54:35.429]  And then they're interactive, they resonate with it, and it's really part of the big battle that we're having right now.
[02:54:35.429 --> 02:54:36.310]  Thank you so much for the time.
[02:54:38.271 --> 02:54:40.311]  Well, that was a really good interview.
[02:54:40.311 --> 02:54:41.432]  Very informative.
[02:54:41.432 --> 02:54:45.372]  And look, it comes down to this.
[02:54:45.372 --> 02:54:51.553]  As a culture, as a society, you would have to have a lobotomy to not know we're in big trouble.
[02:54:51.553 --> 02:54:54.534]  And there are a thousand different distractions out there.
[02:54:54.534 --> 02:55:01.435]  And a lot of times I'll take distractions and cover them because I can get folks that are distracted to tune into the show to actually hear about the real issues.
[02:55:01.435 --> 02:55:03.095]  But let me explain something.
[02:55:03.095 --> 02:55:06.676]  The social engineers, and they've written countless books that we've quoted here on air,
[02:55:07.845 --> 02:55:22.815]  Admit that they're distracting us and dumbing us down and admit they have a larger plan to take control of society and that they want humanity basically out of the ballgame with a decision-making process.
[02:55:22.815 --> 02:55:27.459]  And all I'm saying is, we should want to be in the ballgame.
[02:55:27.459 --> 02:55:31.361]  And people think that means a bunch of work.
[02:55:31.361 --> 02:55:35.064]  My life is so much more fulfilled, so much more dynamic,
[02:55:36.479 --> 02:55:42.621]  Than when I was just a high school student wanting to get decent grades and pick up cheerleaders.
[02:55:42.621 --> 02:55:47.002]  And it wasn't bad, but in fact I had a great life growing up.
[02:55:47.002 --> 02:55:54.225]  It was just that once you really realize there's a battle for the future of humanity, we're designed to be part of that battle.
[02:55:54.225 --> 02:55:56.366]  We're designed to try to build good communities.
[02:55:56.366 --> 02:55:58.686]  We're designed to try to mentor young people.
[02:55:58.686 --> 02:56:01.327]  We're designed to try to teach people what we've learned.
[02:56:01.327 --> 02:56:03.508]  We're designed to learn from our elders as well.
[02:56:05.270 --> 02:56:12.315]  And instead we just euthanize our elders and don't give our veterans health care and abort our babies.
[02:56:12.315 --> 02:56:17.579]  And yeah, there's arguments for all of that out there, but the arguments are frauds.
[02:56:17.579 --> 02:56:22.083]  And the elite don't live the way they want us to live.
[02:56:22.083 --> 02:56:28.408]  The elite have been so decadent so long, they're disconnected from reality and they're dangerous.
[02:56:30.100 --> 02:56:38.848]  Now before we end this hour, we're going to have a lot of the breaking news boiled down tonight on the nightly news, but it all comes down to the fact that they want to control our lives.
[02:56:38.848 --> 02:56:41.831]  Look at this article out of EAG News.
[02:56:41.831 --> 02:56:48.077]  West Virginia teacher threatened with fine for violating Michelle O's school lunch snack rules.
[02:56:48.077 --> 02:56:50.319]  They want to tell us how much vitamin C we should get.
[02:56:50.319 --> 02:56:52.261]  They want to tell us how much fat we should get.
[02:56:52.261 --> 02:56:54.703]  They want to tell us that GMO is okay.
[02:56:54.703 --> 02:56:55.124]  No, it's not.
[02:56:56.533 --> 02:57:04.457]  And that's why we try to fund this operation with high-quality water filters at the lowest price that cut out fluoride, glyphosate, and hundreds of other deadly chemicals.
[02:57:04.457 --> 02:57:10.561]  That's why at InfoWarsStore.com, we're running all these different specials on the nutraceuticals.
[02:57:10.561 --> 02:57:16.544]  Survival Shield Nacin Iodine X2, a true game-changer.
[02:57:16.544 --> 02:57:21.467]  Because it's the deep-earth crystal source of the pure halogen that blocks the bad halogens.
[02:57:21.467 --> 02:57:22.928]  I mean, just try it for yourself, folks.
[02:57:24.636 --> 02:57:25.876]  You will detox, though.
[02:57:25.876 --> 02:57:26.757]  Consult your physician.
[02:57:26.757 --> 02:57:27.917]  This is not a game.
[02:57:27.917 --> 02:57:29.658]  This is a big game changer.
[02:57:29.658 --> 02:57:36.860]  Unfortunately, we developed in the last two years a new source of this, Deep Earth Crystals, and it's very hard to procure.
[02:57:36.860 --> 02:57:39.060]  We're selling out of the supplies we have.
[02:57:39.060 --> 02:57:41.441]  We have one more batch getting made that's smaller right now.
[02:57:41.441 --> 02:57:43.282]  We're basically sold out of the current batch.
[02:57:43.282 --> 02:57:44.622]  We've got a little bit left.
[02:57:44.622 --> 02:57:53.905]  If you go to InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com, you can find the Survival Shield X2 Nacin Iodine, and when it sells out, which it will, we'll still have the original.
[02:57:54.565 --> 02:58:04.454]  And I believe we'll be able to get more of the deep earth crystals, but I told you this story two years ago about how they tried to stop us getting our other really clean form that's from the ocean.
[02:58:04.454 --> 02:58:10.200]  And trying to stop us getting that, we found this source and did the research and found out how it was even better, in my view.
[02:58:10.700 --> 02:58:14.643]  So, InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:58:14.643 --> 02:58:19.546]  We have big discounts going on 2-packs, 5-packs and 10-packs.
[02:58:19.546 --> 02:58:21.628]  This stuff stores for a long time.
[02:58:21.628 --> 02:58:23.169]  So, if I was you, I would stockpile it.
[02:58:23.169 --> 02:58:27.572]  It's that big of a game changer and it helps fund the InfoWars operation.
[02:58:27.572 --> 02:58:32.375]  So, InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:58:32.375 --> 02:58:37.199]  And we'll try our best to continue to be a platform for outside-the-box thinking and for new media.
