[00:00:05.078 --> 00:00:06.099]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:07.160]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.161]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:10.102]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.102 --> 00:00:10.943]  I think I hear an echo in here.
[00:00:10.943 --> 00:00:12.504]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.504 --> 00:00:14.065]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.065 --> 00:00:18.248]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.248 --> 00:00:23.011]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:25.013]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen, already.
[00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.814]  Already, well, well, well into the month of March.
[00:00:31.814 --> 00:00:37.277]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday worldwide broadcast.
[00:00:37.277 --> 00:00:41.400]  I guess that makes it the 19th already.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.685]  First off, we've got a report from Rex Jones on the dangers of sugar and beyond, my 12-year-old son.
[00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:53.390]  And then we're going to come back and launch into all of the news and information.
[00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.054]  The Fed opens the door wider for rate hike, but downgrades economic outlook.
[00:00:58.054 --> 00:01:03.059]  DHS releases another 30,000 criminal aliens onto the streets.
[00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:03.500]  U.S.
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.262]  likely to keep troops basically indefinitely in Afghanistan.
[00:01:06.262 --> 00:01:07.684]  We knew that was coming.
[00:01:07.684 --> 00:01:09.365]  Obama calls for mandatory voting.
[00:01:10.247 --> 00:01:12.330]  Is ISIS building a drone army?
[00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.552]  Breastfeeding pays?
[00:01:13.552 --> 00:01:15.435]  LA Times shows a study.
[00:01:15.435 --> 00:01:16.838]  We already told you about it a long time ago.
[00:01:16.838 --> 00:01:19.142]  Ammo ban is in trouble again.
[00:01:19.142 --> 00:01:23.349]  All this and more straight ahead, but here is Rex Jones's report.
[00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.082]  I'm Rex Jones, and today I'm here to talk about sugar.
[00:01:29.082 --> 00:01:31.123]  There are three main types of sugar.
[00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:38.168]  Type 1 would be natural sugar, which is kind of good for you and is found in most plant and animal byproducts such as apples or honey.
[00:01:38.168 --> 00:01:43.832]  Type 2, however, is not that good for you and can be found in grocery stores or on your table.
[00:01:43.832 --> 00:01:48.496]  However, Type 3, high fructose corn syrup, is so bad it belongs in a trash can.
[00:01:50.217 --> 00:01:54.260]  It's very toxic to humans and it's linked to diabetes and obesity.
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:03.887]  I'm at South by Southwest, standing in front of a McDonald's landfill where they're issuing out free food to the mind-controlled populace here.
[00:02:03.887 --> 00:02:10.932]  Despite the numerous sugar giants out there, the American people are waking up and realizing that hidden sugar is a lie.
[00:02:13.112 --> 00:02:18.656]  What you see behind me right now is an example of how we are fighting back against the food tyranny.
[00:02:18.656 --> 00:02:27.002]  The hilariously funny Donald McRonald character behind us is an example of how we can use humor to fight back against the global tyranny.
[00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:31.485]  Let's face it, there's a reason McDonald's is losing money every month.
[00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:35.308]  People are waking up and they're realizing they don't want to eat the garbage anymore.
[00:02:38.928 --> 00:02:41.851]  This is how we use their own propaganda against them.
[00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:47.738]  This is how we flip the message to make sure people are informed and make the right healthy choices.
[00:02:47.738 --> 00:02:51.883]  Let's go find out more on the hidden menace of sugar.
[00:02:51.883 --> 00:02:58.490]  Studies show that Oreos, a highly sugar-laden product, are no less addictive than cocaine and morphine.
[00:02:59.372 --> 00:03:10.903]  Even though we associate significant health hazards with taking drugs like cocaine and morphine, high-fat and high-sugar foods may represent even more of a danger because of their accessibility and their affordability.
[00:03:10.903 --> 00:03:11.684]  According to the U.S.
[00:03:11.684 --> 00:03:18.129]  Department of Agriculture, Americans consume an average of 156 pounds of sugar a year.
[00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:23.354]  Only about 29 pounds of it comes from traditional sugar, according to the Sugar Association.
[00:03:23.354 --> 00:03:24.936]  The rest comes from food.
[00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:39.008]  Now we're about to walk out the door and go to the grocery store, where we will learn how much hidden sugar is behind the label that you don't see in foods you would never suspect.
[00:03:42.637 --> 00:03:43.557]  Baked Beans, 12 grams.
[00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:44.198]  Ketchup, 4 grams.
[00:03:44.198 --> 00:03:44.998]  Pasta Sauce, 6 grams.
[00:03:44.998 --> 00:03:45.818]  Salad Dressing, 10 grams.
[00:03:45.818 --> 00:03:47.359]  Barbecue Sauce, 16 grams.
[00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:48.439]  Peaches, 11 grams.
[00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.880]  Tea, 17 grams.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.101]  Healthy Cereal, 9 grams.
[00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:52.581]  Coleslaw, 13 grams.
[00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:13.123]  Even though most of these amounts may look small and insignificant, they're all based on serving size.
[00:04:13.123 --> 00:04:18.405]  When was the last time you only had three chips in a sitting or one squirt of ketchup on your burger?
[00:04:18.405 --> 00:04:34.111]  Now that you see all the hidden sugar in these foods you would never suspect some high fructose corn syrup or dextrose to be in, it makes you wonder, how much sugar do we really consume and where else is it hidden in our lives?
[00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:50.840]  Despite relentless PR being perpetrated against them and the so-called mighty food giants behind me trying to influence their point of view, the American people are fighting back and realizing that hidden sugar and high fructose carbs are a part of a lot.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.722]  Alright folks, I'm proud of that report.
[00:04:53.722 --> 00:04:56.004]  He pretty much edited that with Buckley's help.
[00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.485]  Came up with the whole thing and shot it.
[00:04:57.485 --> 00:04:59.286]  That's about 95% Rex Jones.
[00:04:59.286 --> 00:05:00.067]  Very proud of him.
[00:05:00.067 --> 00:05:04.671]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:11.077]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:15.941]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance.
[00:05:16.161 --> 00:05:20.428]  To create superior vitality in males and females.

[00:05:29.977 --> 00:05:33.639]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.922]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:37.922 --> 00:05:39.703]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:39.703 --> 00:05:47.569]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:48.710]  But for how long?
[00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.334]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:55.334 --> 00:05:58.156]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:06:00.123 --> 00:06:01.043]  Alex Jones here.
[00:06:01.043 --> 00:06:10.266]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:15.508]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.
[00:06:15.848 --> 00:06:19.569]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:29.111]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge and prepare your body for what experts admit is the most dangerous season of the year.
[00:06:29.111 --> 00:06:40.534]  We have rejected hundreds of other formulations in our quest to bring you what is simply the most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that we have ever created in the realm of herbal immunity.

[00:06:45.515 --> 00:06:48.876]  With exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[00:06:48.876 --> 00:06:52.277]  Now is the time to secure ancient defense for you and your family.
[00:06:52.277 --> 00:06:54.878]  Visit Infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:54.878 --> 00:06:56.059]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.481]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[00:07:00.481 --> 00:07:01.061]  Good, brother.
[00:07:01.061 --> 00:07:02.783]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:07:02.783 --> 00:07:04.725]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:08.768]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:07:08.768 --> 00:07:11.371]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:07:11.371 --> 00:07:13.813]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:07:13.813 --> 00:07:21.700]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.205]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:07:25.205 --> 00:07:26.747]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:07:26.747 --> 00:07:29.691]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:31.433]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:07:31.433 --> 00:07:37.241]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated.
[00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:39.282]  Or maximum potency.
[00:07:39.282 --> 00:07:49.488]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[00:07:49.488 --> 00:07:51.289]  So, it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:58.233]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:08:11.445 --> 00:08:15.929]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:17.290]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:38.524 --> 00:08:48.386]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide on this live Thursday, the 19th day of March, 2015 Global Transmission.
[00:08:48.386 --> 00:08:58.568]  We have an amazing researcher and documentary filmmaker joining us, the maker of Doctored, the film the American Medical Association does not want you to see.
[00:08:58.568 --> 00:09:05.889]  Joining us coming up in the third hour today and we'll play some clips of the film as well and talk about it.
[00:09:07.307 --> 00:09:16.652]  In the meantime, let me just be as calm as I can, try to just give you some of the news we're going to be breaking down as best I can today.
[00:09:16.652 --> 00:09:21.694]  The Fed opens the door wider for rate hike, but downgrades economic outlook.
[00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:27.017]  We've been telling you that they're, by design, trying to implode the economy.
[00:09:27.017 --> 00:09:31.759]  Swedish Central Bank cuts key rate further below zero.
[00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:32.900]  That is the race to the bottom.
[00:09:34.534 --> 00:09:35.494]  Bailout is back.
[00:09:35.494 --> 00:09:41.497]  Fannie and Freddie likely need additional treasury investment after derivatives losses.
[00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:43.618]  We're going to tie all of this together.
[00:09:43.618 --> 00:09:49.781]  Ten charts which show we are much worse off than just before the last economic crisis.
[00:09:49.781 --> 00:09:57.885]  I'm going to go over these charts and do an economic breakdown at the bottom of the hour in about 23-24 minutes.
[00:09:57.885 --> 00:09:59.505]  Look at this stack of news.
[00:09:59.505 --> 00:10:02.867]  DHS released another 30,000 criminal aliens onto the streets.
[00:10:04.113 --> 00:10:04.673]  In just a few minutes.
[00:10:22.702 --> 00:10:33.953]  And if you dig deeper into these stories from Kansas City to Los Angeles, California, from Dallas, Texas to New York, it's people coming in out of Latin America and Asia that have these deadly strains.
[00:10:33.953 --> 00:10:39.678]  Can you imagine if they treated this like they did the measles?
[00:10:39.678 --> 00:10:41.960]  Because that's something that hasn't killed anybody in over a decade.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.563]  It makes you get some red spots on your face and a fever.
[00:10:46.596 --> 00:11:07.962]  Can you imagine if we apply the same logic to the tens of thousands a month getting tuberculosis in the United States and the huge wards of people that are confined sometimes for years because they can't leave because they will give people uncurable TB.
[00:11:07.962 --> 00:11:10.102]  UNCURABLE!
[00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:11.923]  TB is pouring into the US
[00:11:13.903 --> 00:11:18.186]  And, oh well, it's brown people, so we better not say anything.
[00:11:18.186 --> 00:11:25.051]  Oh, Muslims in one town reportedly raped 5,000 girls, admittedly, so the government covered it up in England.
[00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:39.601]  This is political correctness, where you gesticulate in front of Obama, because he's supposedly African or whatever, when he's setting up death panels for the military, Obamacare, trying to take our guns, because after all, he's black, so it's okay.
[00:11:40.592 --> 00:11:54.358]  The system brainwashes us about political correctness, not because they care about black people, or quote, brown people, but because it just becomes a political smokescreen for the real agenda.
[00:11:54.358 --> 00:11:57.400]  Amazing.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:09.686]  If you're a jail worker, or a police officer, or an aid worker, or somebody that eats fast food, or eats stuff at restaurants, period, I was talking to William Binney, who right before he left the NSA, he and five others got
[00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:19.033]  Type A. In the lunchroom.
[00:12:19.033 --> 00:12:20.614]  Hepatitis.
[00:12:20.614 --> 00:12:22.974]  At the National Security Agency, probably on purpose.
[00:12:22.974 --> 00:12:29.556]  But the point is, that'll eat your liver and kill you, and the vaccines, the studies show, don't even protect you.
[00:12:29.556 --> 00:12:33.437]  It's all a giant fraud.
[00:12:33.437 --> 00:12:37.278]  But these diseases are pouring across
[00:12:38.447 --> 00:12:40.308]  The borders of the United States.
[00:12:40.308 --> 00:12:52.395]  And it'll be no big deal when you or your child get drug resistant or drug immune TB and you get locked up in a modern sanitarium for the rest of your natural days.
[00:12:52.395 --> 00:12:53.836]  But oh my gosh!
[00:12:53.836 --> 00:12:56.057]  20-something people got measles.
[00:12:56.057 --> 00:12:59.939]  Oh, it turns out they had just been vaccinated.
[00:12:59.939 --> 00:13:07.504]  Now that political correctness and brainwashing ties into this Daily Mail story.
[00:13:08.806 --> 00:13:14.489]  Starbucks hit by cascade of negativity after ordering staff to talk racism with customers.
[00:13:14.489 --> 00:13:20.113]  Vice President forced off Twitter as angry public turns on patronizing project.
[00:13:20.113 --> 00:13:24.436]  That's patronizing.
[00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:26.317]  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Time Magazine.
[00:13:26.317 --> 00:13:30.319]  Starbucks flawed but wonderful plan to tackle race.
[00:13:30.319 --> 00:13:34.322]  Starbucks defend race together policy.
[00:13:34.322 --> 00:13:37.824]  This is about getting us ready to pay trillions more to foreign banks.
[00:13:38.561 --> 00:13:41.242]  Propping up fraudulent counterfeit derivatives.
[00:13:41.242 --> 00:13:42.742]  Supporting all these illegal wars.
[00:13:42.742 --> 00:13:49.805]  Supporting putting the veterans, black, white, hispanic, old, young, on secret do not treat death list.
[00:13:49.805 --> 00:13:55.727]  Ignoring dehumanization as automation replaces human activity and as human activity is basically banned.
[00:13:55.727 --> 00:13:59.148]  Elon Musk, in the future, human driving cars will be illegal.
[00:13:59.148 --> 00:14:00.308]  Well, of course they will be.
[00:14:00.308 --> 00:14:02.389]  The UN and others have announced that's the plan.
[00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:03.830]  I've been telling you that for 20 years.
[00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.511]  I've been warning you because it's all in the official UN
[00:14:07.771 --> 00:14:14.497]  Club of Rome, Council on Foreign Relations, MIT, Rand Corporation.
[00:14:14.497 --> 00:14:19.542]  I mean, I've read hundreds and hundreds and CTRL-F'd, scanned with keywords.
[00:14:19.542 --> 00:14:21.543]  I don't read them all.
[00:14:21.543 --> 00:14:22.444]  Government documents.
[00:14:22.444 --> 00:14:24.866]  We've shown you the Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[00:14:24.866 --> 00:14:29.511]  We've shown you the National Police Stabilization Force.
[00:14:29.511 --> 00:14:30.511]  We know the plan.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:41.103]  I don't care if you read a Rand Corporation or a Council on Foreign Relations public policy report that then gets adopted by government whole cloth, it's all the same plan.
[00:14:41.103 --> 00:14:44.765]  And we ain't in it.
[00:14:44.765 --> 00:14:50.086]  That's why it's so sexy, I saw on CNN today, to live in this new fashionable off-the-grid house.
[00:14:50.086 --> 00:14:58.549]  They use the term off-the-grid and sustainable when it's not really off-the-grid, and it's not sustainable, and it's 300 square feet.
[00:14:58.549 --> 00:14:59.970]  And you pay a lot more for it.
[00:15:01.203 --> 00:15:05.446]  They're just selling us on the dehumanization.
[00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:09.788]  That ties in to the Starbucks situation.
[00:15:09.788 --> 00:15:30.561]  I didn't know about Planet Fitness, but I want to go to one and do an undercover report that if you barely set a weight down, an alarm goes off on the wall, like you're in Star Trek and the Klingons are attacking, and then little control freaks in Star Trek outfits, basically, purple outfits, show up and harass you.
[00:15:33.029 --> 00:15:38.171]  But if a man wants to dress up like a woman and go in the women's restroom, who weighs like 400 pounds, that's A-OK.
[00:15:38.171 --> 00:15:39.652]  He wasn't even a member.
[00:15:39.652 --> 00:15:41.752]  You complain, you get kicked out.
[00:15:41.752 --> 00:15:44.673]  And then there isn't a squat rack because that's seen as manly.
[00:15:44.673 --> 00:15:45.734]  And it's just everything.
[00:15:45.734 --> 00:15:51.536]  These big corporations are turning their facilities into literal.
[00:15:51.536 --> 00:15:55.358]  I use that word a lot because this is not a parable.
[00:15:55.358 --> 00:16:01.020]  When I tell you America and the world is being turned into a giant cross between a gulag and a
[00:16:02.987 --> 00:16:07.970]  Huge, oh, what would the term be?
[00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.212]  Re-education center.
[00:16:10.212 --> 00:16:17.197]  Meets Las Vegas.
[00:16:17.197 --> 00:16:25.302]  Meets Times Square, where you're just bombarded with conditioning in your face.
[00:16:25.302 --> 00:16:28.765]  This is the control freaks relishing what they're doing.
[00:16:30.882 --> 00:16:35.905]  And so imagine you go up, there's 10 people in front of you at Starbucks.
[00:16:35.905 --> 00:16:39.808]  I don't like supporting big, mega corporations, but they do have powerful coffee.
[00:16:39.808 --> 00:16:44.391]  I go there probably one-tenth as much as I did five years ago, and that was hardly any.
[00:16:44.391 --> 00:16:46.773]  Now I will never buy any Starbucks.
[00:16:46.773 --> 00:16:48.734]  I will not drink Starbucks.
[00:16:48.734 --> 00:16:49.755]  I don't care if I'm in a hotel.
[00:16:50.779 --> 00:17:12.790]  And they serve Starbucks, I'm gonna say, I want something else, bring me something else, or give me hot tea, give me Earl Grey, because they're anti-gun, they won't let consult carry people in their offices, they fund anti-gun control, they fund open borders, and they're in the news today pushing it, and so you get up there and they go, do you know about white privilege?
[00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:16.952]  I mean, imagine five years ago, a sitcom or drama, this is beyond Portlandia,
[00:17:18.254 --> 00:17:27.579]  Where you go to get coffee and they ask you about white privilege and you're some Russian who has no history of connection to any black slavery.
[00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:33.822]  By the way, most immigrants came to this country after 1900 who were white and had no history.
[00:17:33.822 --> 00:17:37.404]  2% of Southerners owned slaves.
[00:17:37.404 --> 00:17:45.608]  You can go to a pretty good sized auditorium of people and have trouble finding somebody who had ancestors who were involved in slavery.
[00:17:48.629 --> 00:17:52.557]  You go to the right town in Texas or Alabama or Tennessee, you might be able to find some folks.
[00:17:52.557 --> 00:17:54.060]  But I mean, so what?
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.846]  If my dad was a murderer, it isn't my fault.
[00:17:56.846 --> 00:17:59.070]  What about great-great-great-great-granddaddy?
[00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.093]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:18:01.544 --> 00:18:04.147]  But again, we're being totally gang-raped by the globalists.
[00:18:04.147 --> 00:18:05.909]  They want to sit each other's throat.
[00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:13.739]  And, I mean, I don't even watch mainstream television a lot, but every time I'm in a restaurant or turn it on, it's race, race, race, race, race, race, race, race.
[00:18:13.739 --> 00:18:19.726]  They set up political correctness, sounding legitimate, to help people get a good place in life, to end division.
[00:18:20.427 --> 00:18:34.944]  With the ideas of Martin Luther King and common sense, and then they totally doubled back and are using it now, that the studies are out and the actuaries are out and the demographics are out today, America is now officially more than half, quote, brown.
[00:18:34.944 --> 00:18:36.646]  The world is only about 7% white.
[00:18:39.881 --> 00:18:42.502]  And that's using demographic numbers that are mixed.
[00:18:42.502 --> 00:18:45.362]  We're probably talking 5% of the world is white.
[00:18:45.362 --> 00:18:57.005]  In countries that are 95% African or 80 plus percent, you know, Mesoamerican or whatever, they will call the minorities, whites, the majority and the oppressors.
[00:19:00.962 --> 00:19:07.685]  It's all just a way to corner any middle classes or any highly industrialized area to manipulate them.
[00:19:07.685 --> 00:19:12.126]  They tell the Japanese they're racist if they don't accept unlimited immigrants and give up their culture.
[00:19:12.126 --> 00:19:15.528]  Well, you're racist against South Koreans and Chinese because you invaded them.
[00:19:15.528 --> 00:19:19.509]  Well, China invaded Japan, South Korea, they all have wars with each other.
[00:19:19.509 --> 00:19:22.970]  Vietnam's basically been at war with China for six months.
[00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:26.592]  Does that mean that, you know, China's got to give Vietnam something free?
[00:19:26.592 --> 00:19:29.313]  They just play this mindless guilt game all day.
[00:19:31.254 --> 00:19:35.716]  But I do want to send my reporters in with hidden cameras to Starbucks today.
[00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:36.496]  Let's do it.
[00:19:36.496 --> 00:19:39.278]  That's a good story for South by Southwest downtown.
[00:19:39.278 --> 00:19:41.699]  And go in and go, oh my gosh, yes, I'm so evil.
[00:19:41.699 --> 00:19:42.619]  I'm white.
[00:19:42.619 --> 00:19:44.460]  What can I do to be better?
[00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:49.926]  I mean, Starbucks doesn't go, do you know 52% of blacks are exterminated before they're born?
[00:19:49.926 --> 00:19:54.868]  Did you know that for blacks, fluoride is twice as bad for them in the cancer rates and diabetes?
[00:19:54.868 --> 00:19:56.729]  Here's a Harvard study.
[00:19:56.729 --> 00:19:57.949]  That's why we filter our water.
[00:19:57.949 --> 00:19:58.910]  No, no, they don't do that.
[00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:00.371]  It's all they'll get is fighting.
[00:20:00.371 --> 00:20:03.052]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[00:20:03.052 --> 00:20:07.374]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:08.774]  Silverlungs.com.

[00:21:00.605 --> 00:21:01.166]  Good, brother.
[00:21:01.166 --> 00:21:03.126]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:21:03.126 --> 00:21:04.847]  Everything you said about them is correct.

[00:21:08.829 --> 00:21:09.629]  Well, thank you, brother.
[00:21:09.629 --> 00:21:13.911]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.

[00:21:31.543 --> 00:21:36.968]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[00:21:37.028 --> 00:21:37.949]  We're good to go.
[00:21:59.685 --> 00:22:00.845]  It's happening again.
[00:22:00.845 --> 00:22:04.466]  The Feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[00:22:04.466 --> 00:22:07.647]  In January, a newly introduced bill, H.R.
[00:22:07.647 --> 00:22:11.948]  378, will take away your right to buy level 3 and higher body armor.

[00:23:09.153 --> 00:23:10.694]  The answer is clear.

[00:23:49.246 --> 00:23:49.646]  Call right now!
[00:24:15.155 --> 00:24:34.500]  So, when I say, welcome back folks, Alex Jones here live, when I say that the social engineers are turning this whole country into a giant re-education camp, and Europe as well, remember the Attorney General said in a media meeting with TV executives, we need to literally brainwash the public into accepting turning their guns in.
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.261]  And a few years ago, News Corp put out a promo video
[00:24:38.576 --> 00:24:43.079]  Internally to the US government saying, we have complied with your directives.
[00:24:43.079 --> 00:24:48.542]  Here are every TV show and movie we've produced promoting global warming and carbon taxes.
[00:24:48.542 --> 00:24:53.645]  And then it's their directors and actors going, and actresses going, thank you, federal government.
[00:24:53.645 --> 00:24:55.346]  We have followed your directive.
[00:24:55.346 --> 00:24:57.167]  I mean, I've played that video probably eight or nine times.
[00:24:58.004 --> 00:25:00.486]  I forget the article Watson wrote about it years ago.
[00:25:00.486 --> 00:25:04.950]  So, they go to meetings, they comply, it's an admitted agenda.
[00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:13.477]  And for so many years it was hard to get the public to even admit that there was a pre-planned, commanded, with military precision program.
[00:25:13.477 --> 00:25:16.900]  Now they admit what they call behavior placement.
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.403]  I call it brainwashing placement or propaganda placement.
[00:25:21.963 --> 00:25:23.584]  And so, now the U.N.
[00:25:23.584 --> 00:25:25.085]  panel to consider U.S.
[00:25:25.085 --> 00:25:29.228]  failure to clear up racial murders of civil rights era.
[00:25:29.228 --> 00:25:32.211]  And now they're talking about not opening our borders completely.
[00:25:32.211 --> 00:25:33.712]  We may go under U.N.
[00:25:33.712 --> 00:25:35.953]  sanctions.
[00:25:35.953 --> 00:25:39.476]  So you see where this is going, and people said, oh, that'll never happen to the U.S.
[00:25:39.476 --> 00:25:40.917]  Oh?
[00:25:40.917 --> 00:25:41.377]  The U.N.'
[00:25:41.357 --> 00:25:43.319]  's getting ready to put sanctions with the U.S.
[00:25:43.319 --> 00:25:44.540]  on Israel.
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.841]  That's in the news.
[00:25:45.841 --> 00:25:47.622]  You can say, well, Israel deserves it, or whatever.
[00:25:47.622 --> 00:25:48.983]  Well, see, you've just fallen into the trap.
[00:25:48.983 --> 00:25:50.124]  Now you're under global control.
[00:25:52.648 --> 00:26:06.624]  So, the UN, who was in the news a couple years ago, in the New York Times even, admitting that UN peacekeepers line up whole African villages and blow their heads off to take their land for carbon sinks.
[00:26:06.624 --> 00:26:08.285]  That is a carbon easement.
[00:26:09.013 --> 00:26:10.455]  Oh, you want to build a gold mine over here?
[00:26:10.455 --> 00:26:13.860]  For some globalist company?
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.442]  In that case, it was a lithium mine?
[00:26:15.442 --> 00:26:18.766]  That's fine, but you've got to clear these villagers off and make this a nature preserve.
[00:26:18.766 --> 00:26:19.828]  Let's mow them down.
[00:26:19.828 --> 00:26:21.149]  Oh, that's okay.
[00:26:21.149 --> 00:26:22.551]  Mowing them down's alright.
[00:26:22.551 --> 00:26:23.452]  If Bill and Melinda Gates...
[00:26:24.533 --> 00:26:31.397]  You know, in India have 64,000 paralyzed kids, several thousand that died after taking the polio vaccine.
[00:26:31.397 --> 00:26:35.559]  That's loving and liberal because we didn't say it was politically incorrect.
[00:26:35.559 --> 00:26:38.640]  Actually killing them and maiming them is trendy and loving.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:43.823]  And if you blow the little black kids heads off or chop them up in the womb, it's good.
[00:26:43.823 --> 00:26:45.444]  But when you go to Starbucks,
[00:26:46.795 --> 00:26:50.456]  Hi, oh, you'd like a Grande or whatever trendy name we have today?
[00:26:50.456 --> 00:26:51.657]  That's fine.
[00:26:51.657 --> 00:26:52.817]  Oh, hi, I notice you're white.
[00:26:52.817 --> 00:26:53.638]  I am too.
[00:26:53.638 --> 00:26:56.759]  We need to all work on race relations together, okay?
[00:26:56.759 --> 00:26:58.920]  It's kind of bad that we're white, alright?
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.460]  Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, you're black.
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:06.543]  I just want to say that I worship you and I'm real sorry for all I've done to make everybody uncomfortable and weird.
[00:27:08.356 --> 00:27:14.000]  Imagine if I walked around my office and walked up to Jakari Jackson and said, I'm really sorry, I'm white.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.743]  I just want to thank you for being black.
[00:27:17.743 --> 00:27:22.967]  Or maybe if somebody has a beard, somebody doesn't have a beard, you walk up and you say, you know, it's okay that you don't have a beard.
[00:27:24.585 --> 00:27:25.326]  Okay, it's alright.
[00:27:25.326 --> 00:27:31.510]  Or maybe one of our guys with a beard walks up to one of the women that works here and said, I want you to know that I'm different from you, but I don't mean anything bad by it.
[00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:33.271]  I know it may make you uncomfortable that I have a beard.
[00:27:33.271 --> 00:27:46.680]  I mean, that's the level of mental illness they're trying to impose on us, where we're just totally screwed up, obsessed with everything that's being said, to where I have repeatedly been in crowds of people and heard someone go, I want Chinese food tonight.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.222]  And everybody goes, you said the word Chinese.
[00:27:50.222 --> 00:27:52.484]  They now are using the word Lunar New Year.
[00:27:52.484 --> 00:27:53.945]  You don't want to say Chinese New Year.
[00:27:54.924 --> 00:28:00.848]  Or, oh my gosh, in Europe they're banning the word Blackbird, because it's racist.
[00:28:00.848 --> 00:28:11.914]  But don't worry, they're also going to ban the word Whitebird, or Snow Owl, someone might be over, or Brown Bag, oh, your colors, everything, racism, racism, Black Table.
[00:28:11.914 --> 00:28:14.616]  And see, I put my elbows on this Black Table.
[00:28:14.616 --> 00:28:20.039]  We didn't choose a Black Table because it picks up the reflections and looks powerful and cool, and like the deck of the Death Star.
[00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:24.862]  No, no, we chose it so I could put my elbows on the black people.
[00:28:24.862 --> 00:28:32.148]  Yes, everything is code, except the mass murder of black people worldwide by the eugenicist globalist.
[00:28:32.148 --> 00:28:34.190]  This is all psych warfare on record.
[00:28:34.932 --> 00:28:39.754]  Hi, I'd like a small cup of coffee and one of those blueberry muffins please.
[00:28:39.754 --> 00:28:46.437]  You mean you'd like a tall, using their psych warfare, notice a tall, a little coffee is not a tall.
[00:28:46.437 --> 00:28:53.841]  But it's all part of the, everything's about scrambling, confusing, upturning reality where you have no bearing where they can control you.
[00:28:53.841 --> 00:28:56.662]  You go to the free McDonald's outfit down on 4th Street and
[00:28:58.823 --> 00:29:20.839]  Red River or First Street and Red River goes down to Fourth Street and there's just mutated dead babies and skulls in a giant wrap a hundred yards around it and I'm looking at it Tuesday on air and I go that looks like DU mutated babies I said Google that we pulled it up and I go yep bloated lips the eyeballs that way I go I've only seen that one other place it's mutated babies from Fallujah
[00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:28.844]  And then we went, oh my God, and learned it was a TV show on Cartoon Network about, after a nuclear apocalypse, all the mutated babies.
[00:29:30.629 --> 00:29:35.331]  So see, people at first when we're getting tweets and comments, oh you're nuts, there's not mutated DU babies.
[00:29:35.331 --> 00:29:49.318]  Yes, mutated DU rotting babies with pus balls and pus marks all over their arms with diseases, dying in pain and dead babies with skulls and satanic lightning bolts at McDonald's.
[00:29:49.318 --> 00:29:50.538]  This is in your face.
[00:29:50.538 --> 00:29:51.659]  These people are sick!
[00:29:51.659 --> 00:29:52.579]  I see it!
[00:29:52.579 --> 00:29:53.960]  I see it all!
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.761]  I see your matrix!
[00:29:55.761 --> 00:29:56.981]  I know you enemy!
[00:29:56.981 --> 00:29:58.242]  I know you of all of them!

[00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:22.732]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:30:22.952 --> 00:30:23.572]  I think so.
[00:30:45.708 --> 00:30:50.852]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.

[00:32:35.003 --> 00:32:38.586]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:32:38.926 --> 00:32:45.551]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:32:45.551 --> 00:32:50.695]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[00:33:06.383 --> 00:33:10.525]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:33:10.525 --> 00:33:12.206]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:12.206 --> 00:33:20.449]  The poets tell how Poncho fell.
[00:33:20.449 --> 00:33:24.391]  He left his living in cheap hotels.
[00:33:24.391 --> 00:33:28.433]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold.
[00:33:28.433 --> 00:33:32.275]  So the story ends, we're told.
[00:33:32.275 --> 00:33:34.796]  Poncho needs your prayers, it's true.
[00:33:36.058 --> 00:33:42.963]  I think Merle Hacker may have the best voice in country.
[00:33:42.963 --> 00:33:45.925]  The problem is he doesn't have the best written songs.
[00:33:45.925 --> 00:33:46.526]  Powerful!
[00:33:56.090 --> 00:34:14.692]  Oh, but we're told it's the end of the age of humans, and the beautiful voices, and the beautiful literature, and the beautiful poetry, and the beautiful sculpting, and the beautiful adventures, and the friendships, and the kinship, and the passion, and the love, and the struggles, and everything our ancestors built to this point.
[00:34:15.433 --> 00:34:17.975]  Now, just to know, a bunch of political correctness.
[00:34:17.975 --> 00:34:28.645]  You go to Planet Fitness and if you barely bang weights, alarms go off and men in pink outfits show up and go, just training us to live in a giant impact prison.
[00:34:30.851 --> 00:34:32.712]  You go get a Starbucks coffee.
[00:34:32.712 --> 00:34:35.333]  Oh my gosh, you wear your white privilege?
[00:34:35.333 --> 00:34:36.973]  In fact, I didn't cover it yesterday.
[00:34:36.973 --> 00:34:43.876]  Under the cover of exposing white privilege, they're now teaching in Kentucky under federal grants.
[00:34:43.876 --> 00:34:45.617]  It's mainstream news.
[00:34:45.617 --> 00:34:50.098]  Five-year-olds about how to exchange gender fluids.
[00:34:50.098 --> 00:34:51.799]  How to... I can't even say this on air.
[00:34:54.730 --> 00:35:08.562]  I was reading what they're teaching five-year-olds, and I didn't even know about this, being a 41-year-old worldly person, I thought, who's been around the block a couple times, maybe a couple hundred times.
[00:35:08.562 --> 00:35:14.647]  And I was reading the transcripts of what they teach, and I can't say it on air.
[00:35:14.647 --> 00:35:15.948]  In fact, it's not even in the article.
[00:35:15.948 --> 00:35:16.629]  You gotta link through.
[00:35:20.486 --> 00:35:21.527]  Can you guys pull that up for me?
[00:35:21.527 --> 00:35:22.207]  It was in the stack.
[00:35:22.207 --> 00:35:23.047]  I said I'd get to it.
[00:35:23.047 --> 00:35:26.990]  I mean, this is a psych warfare attack.
[00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:44.059]  White Privilege Conference Workshop pushes grade school lessons about genderqueer, transgender folks and exchanging gender fluids, lecturing elementary school-aged children, I'm not kidding, it's five-year-olds, about gay, lesbian, and transgender issues.
[00:35:44.059 --> 00:35:45.200]  Holy Toledo.
[00:35:47.577 --> 00:35:56.221]  I'm 41 and I was reading this and learning things that five-year-olds are learning.
[00:35:56.221 --> 00:36:00.543]  And then if you don't go along with it, you hate gay people.
[00:36:00.543 --> 00:36:01.624]  Notice how they just keep pushing.
[00:36:01.624 --> 00:36:04.185]  Or if you don't accept putting your guns in, you hate black people.
[00:36:06.544 --> 00:36:13.049]  Do you understand the left at the top knows that they are not liberals, that they are not freedom pushers?
[00:36:13.049 --> 00:36:14.910]  They are tyrants.
[00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:17.132]  They have stolen every word out there.
[00:36:17.132 --> 00:36:19.694]  They are a menace!
[00:36:19.694 --> 00:36:24.998]  And they are social engineers with a plan.
[00:36:24.998 --> 00:36:29.961]  An endgame, 1.5, that was released to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.741]  An addendum to the film.
[00:36:33.741 --> 00:36:46.006]  We have Dr. Kaufman, university professor, and he's going over university documents that we show on screen from Columbia, you name it, where they said in 1963, we're going to break the family up.
[00:36:46.006 --> 00:36:48.167]  We're going to call it a civil rights issue.
[00:36:48.167 --> 00:36:52.849]  We're going to push infertility with chemicals and vaccines and things.
[00:36:52.849 --> 00:36:56.351]  We've got to find that clip from that film and show that to folks.
[00:36:56.351 --> 00:36:59.012]  And we're going to then move past quote,
[00:37:00.666 --> 00:37:08.590]  Gay rights to hundreds of different designations and then we're going to end sexuality and make it totally asexual where there is no sexuality.
[00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:15.093]  And that's the new thing they push for men and women to both look the same, act the same, and basically have no sexuality.
[00:37:15.093 --> 00:37:18.114]  What a horrible world they want to build!
[00:37:18.114 --> 00:37:20.115]  What an anti-liberal world!
[00:37:20.115 --> 00:37:23.857]  What a group of just horrible anti-humans!
[00:37:23.857 --> 00:37:25.038]  They are enemies!
[00:37:27.796 --> 00:37:28.857]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[00:37:28.857 --> 00:37:39.185]  Let me tell you, I run an operation with 50 crew members, and I've worked in other businesses, and I've worked as a salesman, and I've worked as a dental assistant, and I've worked on a golf course, and I've worked as a ranch hand.
[00:37:39.185 --> 00:37:43.548]  You start getting into people's business, you start stirring stuff up, you get fights.
[00:37:43.548 --> 00:37:49.512]  The way to have, quote, different humans with different pigment to get along with each other is to go out and eat.
[00:37:50.569 --> 00:38:05.916]  Is to go out and play golf, is to go out and see a movie or a show, is to hang out with people, to go play flag football, to go to the gym, to go to the coffee shop, and that's what everybody's already doing!
[00:38:05.916 --> 00:38:13.079]  And so the globalists want to keep this whole race thing going to get us all each other's throats, and Starbucks is a horribly evil organization.
[00:38:13.079 --> 00:38:17.781]  The CEO of Starbucks knows full well what he's doing.
[00:38:18.922 --> 00:38:22.027]  He's like, I want everybody to be liberal!
[00:38:34.125 --> 00:38:36.206]  Feel like they're working out, but not actually work out.
[00:38:36.206 --> 00:38:38.327]  We don't want to challenge anyone.
[00:38:38.327 --> 00:38:40.508]  First, they banned dodgeball 20 years ago.
[00:38:40.508 --> 00:38:43.030]  Now they've banned tag or running in most schools.
[00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.550]  Look it up.
[00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:45.671]  They've gotten rid of PE.
[00:38:45.671 --> 00:38:50.113]  And now in the gym, you can't grunt or slam weights.
[00:38:50.113 --> 00:38:52.275]  And they have alarms on the walls.
[00:38:52.275 --> 00:39:00.159]  And if you complain about a 400-pound man in drag in the restroom acting weird, you get thrown out when they're not even a member.
[00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:02.090]  See, it's the new class.
[00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:08.393]  They are the gods, so more people adopt it to be part of a privileged group.
[00:39:08.393 --> 00:39:14.676]  It's a new class system to replace an old class system.
[00:39:14.676 --> 00:39:20.438]  Starbucks hit by cascade of negativity after ordering staff to talk racism with customers.
[00:39:20.438 --> 00:39:27.741]  Vice President forced off Twitter as angry public turns on patronizing project.
[00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:31.451]  It's so patronizing.
[00:39:31.451 --> 00:39:32.832]  Oh, hi, you want to spend money?
[00:39:32.832 --> 00:39:34.593]  Oh my gosh, you're white.
[00:39:34.593 --> 00:39:35.394]  I mean, my God.
[00:39:35.394 --> 00:39:36.254]  Well, yeah, you're white, too.
[00:39:36.254 --> 00:39:41.958]  Well, I'm an 18-year-old, you know, and I want to boss around some 60-year-old getting coffee.
[00:39:41.958 --> 00:39:43.599]  Kind of privilege, you know.
[00:39:43.599 --> 00:39:46.401]  You know, all sex is rape.
[00:39:46.401 --> 00:39:47.962]  Hey, we're fighting racism.
[00:39:47.962 --> 00:39:48.543]  Oh, really?
[00:39:48.543 --> 00:39:54.207]  Yeah, we're going to teach your 5-year-old about how to... how to drink... I can't even say it on air.
[00:39:56.481 --> 00:39:57.463]  People say it's crazy.
[00:39:57.463 --> 00:39:58.927]  No, it's not crazy.
[00:39:58.927 --> 00:40:00.030]  It's a takeover plan.
[00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:03.960]  If they can teach five-year-olds how to do things I can't say on the air.
[00:40:07.423 --> 00:40:09.644]  Then they can do anything, and you know what?
[00:40:09.644 --> 00:40:10.804]  They are.
[00:40:10.804 --> 00:40:27.909]  They're gonna bring TB in, they're gonna bring syphilis in, they're gonna bring every disease in, they're gonna let it spread, they're gonna get away with everything, they're gonna taser you to death, they're gonna bring in world government, they're gonna raise your taxes to pay off foreign banks money we don't even owe, they're gonna do it all, and the whole time dance around.
[00:40:27.909 --> 00:40:32.531]  I saw Google got caught in a bunch of new stuff, and then they, when they talked to their
[00:40:34.315 --> 00:40:38.537]  One of their presidents, they said, but we wear fluffy socks.
[00:40:38.537 --> 00:40:39.398]  That's in my stack.
[00:40:39.398 --> 00:40:45.701]  They're like, what about Google getting hacked and all your passcodes being taken and Google spying on people?
[00:40:45.701 --> 00:40:47.602]  We wear fluffy socks.
[00:40:47.602 --> 00:40:57.287]  Almost every photo of Warren Buffett, a master wicked operative, involved with his banks, with money laundering, narcotics trafficking, that's in Bloomberg, AP Reuters.
[00:40:57.287 --> 00:41:01.109]  But in almost every photo, he goes, I'm just a little old man
[00:41:01.809 --> 00:41:14.714]  And he goes, I scream, Google Warren Buffett's name and click images, almost every images, and he goes, I scream, and it's like Google goes, I'm wearing a pink and a green sock, and I got a little beard, and I talk like this.
[00:41:14.714 --> 00:41:16.474]  You know what those guys do when they get on jets?
[00:41:16.474 --> 00:41:22.956]  They go, bring me 15 hookers now and get the drugs ready and take me to the private island.
[00:41:22.956 --> 00:41:24.277]  Get the satanic rituals ready.
[00:41:24.277 --> 00:41:26.898]  I'm literally, folks, I've been at the highest levels of Hollywood, okay?
[00:41:28.837 --> 00:41:35.080]  And they get on that aircraft and I mean, they are just like, just like, shut the door, let's get this going.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:38.181]  Give me the up, heads up, future predicting dialer.
[00:41:38.181 --> 00:41:42.403]  I want the sat phone on, scramble to NSA headquarters, prepare to run ops.
[00:41:42.403 --> 00:41:46.845]  And they just sit there fixing the stock market and making billions on the side every few days.
[00:41:46.845 --> 00:41:54.248]  And just, just like in huge pleasure aircraft with 14, 15, 20 top, you know, models in the back.
[00:41:54.248 --> 00:41:55.429]  Look it up.
[00:41:55.429 --> 00:41:57.450]  That's come out about this, the pleasure aircraft.
[00:41:58.356 --> 00:42:06.290]  But out front they're like, did you notice I'm wearing... I always say the thing about the socks, because with Google they go, I've got different color socks.
[00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:15.874]  Meanwhile, you're literally dealing with a psy-op satanist, with black-op command forces predicting the future, with spy grid, AI going in everywhere.
[00:42:15.874 --> 00:42:23.217]  They can go in and punch up AI heads up, world models that the Pentagon has as well, integrated, and actually know the future.
[00:42:23.217 --> 00:42:29.200]  They're in there like Sauron or Sauron, and just... Dark sorcerers, total power!
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:33.582]  Meanwhile, they're like, are you racist?
[00:42:33.582 --> 00:42:35.783]  I'm wearing fluffy socks!
[00:42:37.861 --> 00:42:41.562]  And that's the reason I act like this, because I've been around some of these people.
[00:42:41.562 --> 00:42:49.563]  I've been at some of the parties with the Facebook people and Google people, and they see me, and they just leave, or they say, get him out of here.
[00:42:49.563 --> 00:42:55.165]  And they see me, and it'll be like, and they just go, ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah, let's get, and they'll leave.
[00:42:55.165 --> 00:43:06.587]  And that's the look on, I mean, they'll literally go, ha, ha, just let me know, I know you, Jones, yeah, yeah, liberal, I'm liberal, you just wait till I liberal everybody, ha, ha, ha.
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:12.431]  We're gonna teach your five-year-old!
[00:43:12.431 --> 00:43:12.972]  You understand?
[00:43:12.972 --> 00:43:14.295]  You're chumps out there, liberals!
[00:43:19.659 --> 00:43:21.119]  In fact, I can't find it in the stack.
[00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:32.082]  Will you guys Google, Google, go to the NSA interface, that goes to opt-in, opt-in to the NSA interface, and just put in, Google fluffy socks.
[00:43:32.082 --> 00:43:43.845]  And people can say, I mean I'm not joking, and they're always like, but we have pinball machines and let people drink beer at lunch, and we have movies about the interns, we're liberal, liberal, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
[00:43:43.845 --> 00:43:46.666]  There's nothing liberal about it.
[00:43:46.666 --> 00:43:47.066]  There it is.
[00:43:50.302 --> 00:43:51.704]  Will you guys print me that article, please?
[00:43:51.704 --> 00:43:53.906]  Don't trust humans!
[00:43:53.906 --> 00:43:56.530]  Wear fluffy socks!
[00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:58.111]  Wisdom from Google X!
[00:44:00.427 --> 00:44:00.667]  See?
[00:44:00.667 --> 00:44:04.989]  They're already saying, don't trust humans to drive cars.
[00:44:04.989 --> 00:44:06.110]  Time Magazine.
[00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:07.350]  Don't trust humans.
[00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:10.792]  The new liberal system, the computers will make the decisions.
[00:44:10.792 --> 00:44:12.172]  Where have we heard that before?
[00:44:12.172 --> 00:44:16.695]  Oh, Rockefeller Foundation funded groups the New York Times promotes.
[00:44:16.695 --> 00:44:21.377]  Movies perhaps, where we get rid of money and the computers make all the decisions.
[00:44:21.377 --> 00:44:27.499]  But don't worry, the makers of the films talk in little lisping voices.
[00:44:27.499 --> 00:44:28.380]  And they're liberal.
[00:44:30.745 --> 00:44:40.407]  We were so desperate that we ended up doing a detailed study about the fluffiness of the socks of the techs who did the balloons.
[00:44:40.407 --> 00:44:47.949]  And see, they'll just throw out something about, don't trust humans, but by the way, we talk about fluffy colored socks.
[00:44:47.949 --> 00:44:49.869]  Now let's pull up Warren Buffett.
[00:44:49.869 --> 00:44:54.630]  Put in Warren Buffett's name, hit images, and you'll see Ice Cream Cone!
[00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:58.011]  And you know who else goes Ice Cream Cone.
[00:44:58.011 --> 00:44:58.711]  Pull up in a van.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.705]  I have ice cream, I have cookies, I have candy, five-year-old.
[00:45:07.705 --> 00:45:10.507]  Everything's okay.
[00:45:10.507 --> 00:45:14.270]  Everything is nice.
[00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:20.194]  Google Warren Buffett ice cream, and then it'll just show hundreds of photos of him with the ice cream cones.
[00:45:20.194 --> 00:45:26.199]  And then if that doesn't work, they go, poppy, poppy, I have a poppy.
[00:45:26.199 --> 00:45:27.180]  You love poppies.
[00:45:29.434 --> 00:45:31.015]  Now there he is with ice cream.
[00:45:31.015 --> 00:45:36.980]  He's, oh, and a banjo, and oh, so non-threatening, a nice man.
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:39.001]  And there he is with his wife and daughter.
[00:45:39.001 --> 00:45:41.083]  Ice cream!
[00:45:41.083 --> 00:45:47.548]  Oh, and another shot of him with a little guitar, and a shot of him having a beer.
[00:45:47.548 --> 00:45:52.392]  Oh, nice old man.
[00:45:52.392 --> 00:45:55.574]  Lives in a modest little house in Omaha.
[00:46:00.689 --> 00:46:09.217]  Meanwhile, behind the facade of this innocent-looking bookstore... Ignore me at your peril!
[00:46:09.217 --> 00:46:11.859]  I am here as a watchman to warn you!
[00:46:11.859 --> 00:46:20.007]  I have seen, I know... I know who the enemy is, and let me tell you, they are vicious wolves who hate you and your family.
[00:46:21.994 --> 00:46:30.682]  And they tell you at McDonald's in downtown Austin they show mutated dead children with pus pouring out of their eyeballs and welts all over their bodies.
[00:46:30.682 --> 00:46:33.124]  Enter here at your own risk and doom.
[00:46:33.124 --> 00:46:37.107]  And the fools throng and their subconscious sees it.
[00:46:37.107 --> 00:46:38.609]  I am being delivered unto death.
[00:46:38.609 --> 00:46:40.350]  I am being delivered unto poison.
[00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:41.151]  I am being delivered.
[00:46:41.151 --> 00:46:43.333]  Just like the golden child allegory.
[00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:46.776]  Great Eddie Murphy movie where they're trying to make the golden child drink the tainted blood.
[00:46:48.991 --> 00:46:50.612]  That's exactly what they're telling you.
[00:46:50.612 --> 00:46:51.673]  Come!
[00:46:51.673 --> 00:46:54.154]  Come and drink from the well!
[00:46:54.154 --> 00:46:56.756]  Join us!
[00:46:56.756 --> 00:47:00.378]  Come and be one with us forever!
[00:47:00.378 --> 00:47:02.359]  But we must first warn them.
[00:47:02.359 --> 00:47:08.283]  We must first let them know before they have passed the gate.
[00:47:08.283 --> 00:47:11.945]  Now I said I would get to the economic news and I will start doing that with the graph.
[00:47:11.945 --> 00:47:13.146]  We actually start the next hour.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:21.565]  And I will get into all the other news here that we're going to be breaking down.
[00:47:21.565 --> 00:47:24.647]  But it's all about them looking non-threatening and just arbiters.
[00:47:24.647 --> 00:47:32.472]  We just want to stop the racism and their internal documents come out and they're funding every form of division they can because they are predators.
[00:47:38.553 --> 00:47:40.153]  And people are backlashing against it.
[00:47:40.153 --> 00:47:41.074]  Here's the good news.
[00:47:41.074 --> 00:47:49.696]  They expect some backlash, some backtalk, but then they always press back again, hoping you finally submit.
[00:47:49.696 --> 00:47:57.318]  But instead, we're just getting madder and madder and madder and madder and seeing through it and understanding it, because we're becoming spiritually immune to it.
[00:47:57.318 --> 00:48:00.018]  Now, there are some who are done.
[00:48:00.018 --> 00:48:03.399]  There are some who you can't help.
[00:48:03.399 --> 00:48:05.480]  But those people don't count, unfortunately.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:06.660]  They have been taken over.
[00:48:10.646 --> 00:48:12.327]  Coming up, exclusive U.S.
[00:48:12.327 --> 00:48:15.309]  likely to delay planned closures of two Afghan bases.
[00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:20.551]  I said six, seven years ago that Obama would never end the Afghan war, that they would always just claim next year, next year.
[00:48:20.551 --> 00:48:22.152]  It's just a tactic, a stalling tactic.
[00:48:22.152 --> 00:48:24.333]  I know you already know that, but just become aware of these tactics.
[00:48:24.333 --> 00:48:29.236]  Become conscious of these tactics.
[00:48:29.236 --> 00:48:30.857]  Obama calls for mandatory voting.
[00:48:32.313 --> 00:48:36.955]  Breastfeeding, I've always talked about this when we were in the studies, but it's in the LA Times now, so it exists.
[00:48:36.955 --> 00:48:40.537]  Babies who nurse earn more as adults, study says.
[00:48:40.537 --> 00:48:42.398]  Yeah, and you know why they do?
[00:48:42.398 --> 00:48:47.241]  Because the brain CC size, in some cases, is upwards of a third larger.
[00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:50.931]  And I breastfed till I was 18 months old, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:50.931 --> 00:49:09.603]  I'm not bragging or anything, but I have a very large CC-sized brain, and my bones are very, very hard, and I'm very, very hardy, and I'm very, very mean, and I don't get sick very often, and it's because a woman's milk gives you all of her immunities and all of her different hormones that activate brain development.
[00:49:10.303 --> 00:49:12.044]  What a conspiracy theory!
[00:49:12.044 --> 00:49:23.628]  Women have those to feed the young of this mammal species and that you do better with the milk of your species and of your genetic creator, your mama.
[00:49:25.148 --> 00:49:27.930]  This apple don't fall far from the tree.
[00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:29.471]  And you don't either.
[00:49:29.471 --> 00:49:32.333]  And I sit there and argue with women and people that I know that are having kids.
[00:49:32.333 --> 00:49:33.534]  People that know me.
[00:49:33.534 --> 00:49:35.515]  They go, yeah, I just need to get back to work though.
[00:49:35.515 --> 00:49:36.636]  I don't think we're going to breastfeed.
[00:49:36.636 --> 00:49:37.416]  Maybe a week.
[00:49:37.416 --> 00:49:38.737]  I just, I go, okay.
[00:49:38.737 --> 00:49:41.239]  So you'd want your kid to have one third smaller brain.
[00:49:41.239 --> 00:49:42.119]  Oh, come on.
[00:49:42.119 --> 00:49:44.221]  Oh, you know, Alex, come on, man.
[00:49:44.221 --> 00:49:44.701]  Come on.
[00:49:44.701 --> 00:49:45.442]  That's rude.
[00:49:45.442 --> 00:49:46.142]  Come on.
[00:49:46.142 --> 00:49:46.822]  Okay, great.
[00:49:46.822 --> 00:49:50.205]  Do you want to take your child and have one third of their brain removed?
[00:49:50.205 --> 00:49:51.966]  Let me put it to you that way.
[00:49:51.966 --> 00:49:52.466]  Real.
[00:49:52.466 --> 00:49:53.347]  They're like, you know what?
[00:49:53.347 --> 00:49:54.768]  I'm really worried about racism right now.
[00:49:57.110 --> 00:49:59.614]  You know what fluoride does to your brain?
[00:49:59.614 --> 00:50:01.818]  Massively rots holes in it, basically.
[00:50:01.818 --> 00:50:03.220]  Look it up yourself.
[00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:04.522]  See, there's a plan here.
[00:50:04.522 --> 00:50:06.506]  There's a reason people are so stupid.
[00:50:07.418 --> 00:50:14.502]  We've been militarily targeted by the globalists for a long, long, long, long time.
[00:50:14.502 --> 00:50:16.143]  They couldn't take us in a frontal assault.
[00:50:16.143 --> 00:50:19.945]  The scientific technocrats took us down in a chem assault and a bio assault.
[00:50:19.945 --> 00:50:22.046]  They've done a really great job.
[00:50:22.046 --> 00:50:23.567]  And what I'm telling you is the truth.
[00:50:23.567 --> 00:50:24.348]  It's not exaggerated.
[00:50:24.348 --> 00:50:25.869]  It's much worse than what I'm saying.
[00:50:25.869 --> 00:50:27.770]  There's no way to go over the full spectrum of this.
[00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:28.950]  And yeah, it freaks me out.
[00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:29.511]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:50:30.657 --> 00:50:38.959]  But see, I'm not crazy because I'm freaked out by bloated dead DU babies and skulls with satanic lightning bolts all over their heads.
[00:50:38.959 --> 00:50:44.220]  Showing they have the mark of the beast and were struck down by Lucifer.
[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:44.700]  I'm not.
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:47.281]  The ones we're showing aren't even shocking.
[00:50:47.281 --> 00:50:52.582]  We can show the skulls, the lightning bolts, show the arm with the pus tools all over it.
[00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:53.702]  Reaching out for a baby.
[00:50:55.268 --> 00:50:57.229]  I mean, it's kind of like Jack Kevorkian's art.
[00:50:57.229 --> 00:50:59.650]  Demon-eating babies coming out of women.
[00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:00.250]  Very loving level.
[00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:03.011]  This hour of GCN brought to you by Lissick.

[00:51:30.178 --> 00:51:31.339]  It's happening again.
[00:51:31.339 --> 00:51:34.960]  The Feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.362]  In January, a newly introduced bill, H.R.
[00:51:38.362 --> 00:51:42.443]  378, will take away your right to buy level 3 and higher body armor.
[00:51:42.443 --> 00:51:47.926]  Katie Armor offers the most affordable level 3 body armor packages on the market today.

[00:51:56.829 --> 00:51:57.890]  Come and take it.
[00:51:59.432 --> 00:52:04.596]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[00:52:04.596 --> 00:52:14.244]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[00:52:14.244 --> 00:52:26.174]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[00:52:26.474 --> 00:52:31.058]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[00:52:31.058 --> 00:52:32.840]  And they're so easy to use.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.762]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[00:52:34.762 --> 00:52:38.765]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[00:52:38.765 --> 00:52:42.329]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping.

[00:52:50.117 --> 00:52:51.098]  Faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[00:52:59.613 --> 00:53:00.614]  Hey, Boomer!
[00:53:00.614 --> 00:53:04.035]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[00:53:04.035 --> 00:53:05.716]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[00:53:05.716 --> 00:53:07.656]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[00:53:07.656 --> 00:53:13.518]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[00:53:13.518 --> 00:53:14.339]  I know, right?
[00:53:14.339 --> 00:53:15.659]  You love it, too!
[00:53:15.659 --> 00:53:17.100]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:18.120]  Let's go get some!
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:19.861]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653.

[00:53:28.479 --> 00:53:29.340]  Harvest Right.
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:35.363]  The makers of the only in-home freeze dryer would like to present to you their greenhouses that double as emergency shelters.
[00:53:35.363 --> 00:53:37.384]  Their greenhouses simply snap together.
[00:53:37.384 --> 00:53:38.485]  No tools needed.
[00:53:38.485 --> 00:53:40.926]  As a greenhouse, it will stand for decades.
[00:53:40.926 --> 00:53:45.809]  It's incredibly strong, long-lasting, and it can be quickly put up or taken down.
[00:53:45.809 --> 00:53:48.731]  It is also ideal when used as an emergency shelter.
[00:53:48.731 --> 00:53:55.655]  Learn more about this great greenhouse and the money you can save over the big box store prices at HarvestRight.com.
[00:53:55.655 --> 00:53:56.855]  That's HarvestRight.com.
[00:54:01.612 --> 00:54:15.498]  I kind of got wound up, folks, by all the sick, culture-destroying garbage.
[00:54:15.498 --> 00:54:22.841]  When McDonald's shows images of dead, rotting babies and skulls and mutated DU babies, they're the most horrible thing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:54:22.841 --> 00:54:23.582]  You've seen the real thing.
[00:54:24.722 --> 00:54:32.308]  They are throwing it in your subconscious's face that you're crap when you come in here to get this free food at South by Southwest where they're handing it out.
[00:54:32.308 --> 00:54:35.291]  And by the way, this is not my opinion.
[00:54:35.291 --> 00:54:49.543]  It has been, again, declassified hundreds of different ways that the CIA from the 50s on had a plan to put out ugly art to basically scramble people's brains so they would accept degradation in the future.
[00:54:50.643 --> 00:54:54.925]  And you can just Google CIA used ugly art as propaganda.
[00:54:54.925 --> 00:54:58.127]  And they kind of whitewash it, but it was in the New York Times last year.
[00:54:58.127 --> 00:55:01.749]  This is what they're doing.
[00:55:01.749 --> 00:55:09.614]  And they're demonizing anything beautiful which isn't part of their system, where they only allow select beauty when they control it.
[00:55:09.614 --> 00:55:14.257]  Just like you can buy video games and murder people all day in simulations if you're a 12-year-old.
[00:55:14.257 --> 00:55:18.559]  But if you, at school, draw a gun, you'll be arrested.
[00:55:18.559 --> 00:55:19.800]  There's no law, they just do it.
[00:55:20.868 --> 00:55:25.990]  So you're being taught that you individually can't create or do anything, only the system can.
[00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:27.310]  There it is, open culture.
[00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:31.312]  How the CIA secretly funded abstract expressionism during the Cold War.
[00:55:31.312 --> 00:55:35.213]  That's a Whitewash article, you actually read it, it was ugly art.
[00:55:35.213 --> 00:55:42.696]  And again, I get some ugly art is actually beautiful if you understand it, but it was done to subvert.
[00:55:42.696 --> 00:55:49.459]  And now it's degenerated down to mutated babies at McDonald's advertising the food.
[00:55:52.494 --> 00:55:58.317]  Before I go any further, ladies and gentlemen, the system knows what they're doing, stopping breastfeeding.
[00:55:58.317 --> 00:56:02.179]  They know what they're doing, stopping people getting healthy organic food.
[00:56:02.179 --> 00:56:03.980]  They know what they're doing, putting fluoride in the water.
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:08.002]  They know what they're doing, giving us vaccines full of cancer viruses and mercury.
[00:56:08.002 --> 00:56:09.142]  This is an attack.
[00:56:09.142 --> 00:56:12.624]  In Ecoscience, written by the White House science czar, talks about it.
[00:56:12.624 --> 00:56:14.105]  But that's just one publication.
[00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:18.359]  I'm going to start the next hour and try to get a little bit more professional.
[00:56:18.359 --> 00:56:20.040]  I mean, I think we covered a lot of issues.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.800]  We had William Benny in studio.
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.441]  I went out to dinner with him last night.
[00:56:23.441 --> 00:56:27.542]  Then we interviewed him driving around in a car for another 45 minutes after dinner.
[00:56:27.542 --> 00:56:33.744]  I mean, you're talking about the head of operations at the NSA.
[00:56:33.744 --> 00:56:37.806]  Before that, the head of offensive operations against the Russians and others.
[00:56:39.662 --> 00:56:46.368]  An incredibly famous codebreaker, a M-theory quantum mechanics physicist, basically.
[00:56:46.368 --> 00:56:50.492]  And I mean, the dinner discussions were over the top.
[00:56:50.492 --> 00:56:54.736]  And he was telling me about how Nick Cage is going to be playing him in a new big movie with Oliver Stone.
[00:56:54.736 --> 00:57:01.522]  He was trying to be, you know, not arrogant, humble, but it's not really, it's a Snowden-slash film about him.
[00:57:02.426 --> 00:57:05.428]  Another actor played, but the main guy is Nick Cage playing him.
[00:57:05.428 --> 00:57:05.888]  Amazing.
[00:57:05.888 --> 00:57:08.410]  So good job for Oliver Stone going in that direction.
[00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:11.812]  Other documentaries he's making.
[00:57:11.812 --> 00:57:13.252]  It's just so exciting.
[00:57:13.252 --> 00:57:15.814]  To me, that was like hanging around with the biggest rock star ever.
[00:57:15.814 --> 00:57:19.976]  And I've hung around with some great rock stars like Dave Mustaine, Billy Corgan and others.
[00:57:19.976 --> 00:57:27.901]  But I like them not just because I like their music, but because they're smart people that care about liberty and will speak out against tyranny and get repercussions for it.
[00:57:27.901 --> 00:57:29.302]  Well, they're real men.
[00:57:29.302 --> 00:57:29.942]  They have honor.
[00:57:29.942 --> 00:57:30.523]  They have courage.
[00:57:31.474 --> 00:57:36.138]  I know rock stars bigger than those guys.
[00:57:36.138 --> 00:57:36.799]  Bigger.
[00:57:36.799 --> 00:57:38.981]  In fact, as big as it gets.
[00:57:38.981 --> 00:57:42.063]  It's not much bigger than people like Dave Mustaine or Billy Corgan, but bigger.
[00:57:42.063 --> 00:57:44.465]  And they're scared to death to speak out.
[00:57:44.465 --> 00:57:46.627]  Well, that's why this show is so important.
[00:57:46.627 --> 00:57:47.968]  We're not afraid.
[00:57:47.968 --> 00:57:52.632]  Because we know the cost if these evil people take over.
[00:57:52.632 --> 00:57:52.993]  Okay?
[00:57:52.993 --> 00:57:55.355]  We understand it's all in or nothing.
[00:57:55.355 --> 00:57:56.256]  I'm not submitting.
[00:57:56.256 --> 00:57:57.737]  I'm not dying on my knees in a ditch.
[00:57:57.737 --> 00:57:58.638]  I'm going to stand up fighting.
[00:57:59.386 --> 00:58:06.547]  That's why I've extended, because people were complaining saying, you know, please extend it or whatever to the weekends, folks that get paid on Fridays or whatever.
[00:58:06.547 --> 00:58:08.868]  People just love sales, that's why we do them more.

[00:58:42.701 --> 00:58:43.481]  Give me the funds.
[00:58:43.481 --> 00:58:44.161]  I'll expand.
[00:58:44.161 --> 00:58:48.344]  I will go up against the enemy 110% viciously.
[00:58:48.344 --> 00:58:48.784]  Stay with us.
[00:58:50.185 --> 00:58:53.847]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:58:53.847 --> 00:58:58.130]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:58:58.130 --> 00:58:59.591]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:58:59.591 --> 00:59:07.756]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:59:07.756 --> 00:59:08.897]  But for how long?
[00:59:08.897 --> 00:59:11.118]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:59:11.118 --> 00:59:15.541]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:59:15.541 --> 00:59:18.363]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:59:19.676 --> 00:59:23.198]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:59:23.198 --> 00:59:31.443]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:31.443 --> 00:59:36.847]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:59:36.847 --> 00:59:39.388]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:54.608]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:06.041 --> 01:00:07.363]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.363 --> 01:00:09.124]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:09.124 --> 01:00:10.886]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.886 --> 01:00:12.468]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.468 --> 01:00:14.010]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:18.214]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:22.279]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.529 --> 01:00:29.190]  All right, here's what's coming up.
[01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:35.254]  I'm going to go through a bunch of news I've already mentioned the headlines on, hit a bunch of news I haven't gotten to yet, and then take your phone calls.
[01:00:35.254 --> 01:00:43.179]  First thing we're going to hit in the next segment, 10 charts which show we are much worse off than just before the last economic crisis.
[01:00:43.179 --> 01:00:48.042]  And that dovetails with Fed opens door wider for rate hike, but downgrades economic outlook.
[01:00:48.042 --> 01:00:53.166]  And that ties into Swedish Central Bank cuts key rate further below zero.
[01:00:55.427 --> 01:00:56.828]  And a new bailout is back.
[01:00:56.828 --> 01:01:03.112]  Fannie and Freddie likely needed additional treasury investment after derivatives losses.
[01:01:03.112 --> 01:01:04.193]  So that's coming up.
[01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:14.320]  Some really serious news showing us that where most of our analysts and economists and experts have said we're going, we are indeed going.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:17.302]  And I also want to get Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on the broadcast soon.
[01:01:18.447 --> 01:01:24.031]  To get into this new Chinese investment, Asian investment bank led by the Chinese Communist government.
[01:01:24.031 --> 01:01:25.812]  He'll be on Friday at 1.30 p.m.
[01:01:25.812 --> 01:01:27.333]  He's on Friday at 1.30 p.m.
[01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:28.634]  Great job, Nico.
[01:01:28.634 --> 01:01:33.838]  Nico does a great job booking many of our guests in there and kind of quarterbacking the show.
[01:01:33.838 --> 01:01:37.721]  And so that is exciting that we've got him coming on the transmission.
[01:01:37.721 --> 01:01:41.924]  Do we have the guy that wrote Robo Apocalypse coming on?
[01:01:41.924 --> 01:01:42.564]  Not yet.
[01:01:42.564 --> 01:01:43.605]  Okay, good.
[01:01:43.605 --> 01:01:45.206]  We're working on that though.
[01:01:45.206 --> 01:01:46.767]  April 3rd is the day we're looking at.
[01:01:46.767 --> 01:01:47.388]  Okay, good.
[01:01:48.396 --> 01:01:48.797]  Why not?
[01:01:48.797 --> 01:01:52.380]  We're so busy around here, we just produce and plan everything around here on air.
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:02:01.470]  I'm tempted to do a real reality show around the office, where we have certain zones in the office that have live cameras and audio, and if people go into those areas, they know that's there.
[01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:04.273]  And I predict it'll become quite popular.
[01:02:04.273 --> 01:02:06.716]  Yes, Joe Jennings is shaking his head.
[01:02:06.716 --> 01:02:06.996]  Joe?
[01:02:07.827 --> 01:02:12.868]  Let's cut to Joe a video feed of your radio listener, Infowars.com.
[01:02:12.868 --> 01:02:14.309]  Let's cut to that video feed.
[01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:18.070]  Joe, I want you guys to get quick on the draw coming on air.
[01:02:18.070 --> 01:02:19.690]  Joe, what do you think of that idea?
[01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:24.532]  Alex, it's okay that you don't have a beard.
[01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:26.912]  Joe, is your name Joe?
[01:02:26.912 --> 01:02:27.813]  You're here to buy coffee?
[01:02:27.813 --> 01:02:30.433]  I see it's Joe Jennings on your credit card.
[01:02:30.433 --> 01:02:32.174]  What do you want to say about the fact that you're white?
[01:02:33.103 --> 01:02:37.165]  And that you... Is Jennings Scottish or is that even worse?
[01:02:37.165 --> 01:02:38.546]  Is that English?
[01:02:38.546 --> 01:02:39.847]  What's the derivation of that name?
[01:02:39.847 --> 01:02:40.687]  I know that's white.
[01:02:40.687 --> 01:02:41.348]  That's bad.
[01:02:41.348 --> 01:02:44.249]  I'm going to have to... Oh my gosh.
[01:02:44.249 --> 01:02:46.951]  It's opaque.
[01:02:46.951 --> 01:02:48.391]  Actually, you're not white.
[01:02:48.391 --> 01:02:50.953]  You are kind of pinkish.
[01:02:50.953 --> 01:02:56.996]  That's the anger of all the different cultures that I have in my bloodline.
[01:02:56.996 --> 01:02:59.357]  Mine seems kind of red with little brown spots.
[01:02:59.357 --> 01:02:59.978]  What does that make me?
[01:03:00.836 --> 01:03:02.297]  A McDonald's eater?
[01:03:02.297 --> 01:03:03.297]  A McDonald's?
[01:03:03.297 --> 01:03:07.819]  Well, he had to be green with giant, blown-out pus lips from the DU.
[01:03:07.819 --> 01:03:08.660]  I shouldn't even joke about it.
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:12.041]  I mean, when I saw those dead DU babies, I said, those look like dead DU babies.
[01:03:12.041 --> 01:03:15.803]  Then we Googled it and found out it's from a show about DU babies.
[01:03:15.803 --> 01:03:17.243]  I just can't get over it.
[01:03:17.243 --> 01:03:17.824]  No one cares.
[01:03:17.824 --> 01:03:21.645]  Oh, yeah, dead DU babies, arms with pus tools all over them.
[01:03:21.645 --> 01:03:26.047]  Can we go to the video or go shoot some high-def photos of all that?
[01:03:26.047 --> 01:03:28.428]  I mean, what did you think when it turned out... What's the name of that show?
[01:03:28.428 --> 01:03:29.529]  Adventureland, CJ?
[01:03:32.176 --> 01:03:33.638]  It's called Adventure Time.
[01:03:33.638 --> 01:03:34.859]  Adventure Time.
[01:03:34.859 --> 01:03:37.261]  Tell us all about the DU Puss Babies.
[01:03:37.261 --> 01:03:39.283]  I'm going to come back and get to the news.
[01:03:39.283 --> 01:03:41.405]  Go ahead.
[01:03:41.405 --> 01:03:44.749]  Sorry, I'm trying to run our video mixer at the same time.
[01:03:44.749 --> 01:03:45.389]  Well, that's alright.
[01:03:45.389 --> 01:03:46.911]  We're going to get it going here.
[01:03:46.911 --> 01:03:48.993]  No, it's just a show about post-Mushroom War.
[01:03:48.993 --> 01:03:51.095]  That's what the characters call it.
[01:03:51.095 --> 01:03:55.720]  And half of them are mutated candy that somehow blended with life forms.
[01:03:57.063 --> 01:04:02.388]  It's funny, it's a cool show, it kind of appeals to pre-teens and adults at the same time.
[01:04:02.388 --> 01:04:08.493]  Sounds like a rip-off of, uh, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.
[01:04:08.493 --> 01:04:11.915]  Cloudy with a Chance of Radiated Babies?
[01:04:11.915 --> 01:04:12.716]  Yeah.
[01:04:12.716 --> 01:04:20.643]  Well, don't you think radiated mutated creatures, humanoids, I mean, that's a great way to advertise McDonald's, isn't it?
[01:04:20.643 --> 01:04:21.223]  Yeah.
[01:04:21.223 --> 01:04:21.804]  Diabetes.
[01:04:23.151 --> 01:04:24.392]  That folks.
[01:04:24.392 --> 01:04:26.713]  In fact, let's look at some of the McDonald's customers here.
[01:04:26.713 --> 01:04:31.536]  Let's blow up that graphic and just kind of look at some of the folks there.
[01:04:31.536 --> 01:04:34.958]  You guys enjoy coming on air impromptu out of the blue?
[01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:35.358]  Absolutely.
[01:04:36.886 --> 01:04:46.235]  Well there you have the McDonald's customers, all different, like a tower of Babel, fighting with each other, with huge loudspeakers going, don't be racist, don't be racist, don't be racist.
[01:04:46.235 --> 01:04:47.897]  The only crime is being different.
[01:04:47.897 --> 01:04:51.340]  That's why we all brought you in here and made you different, and then pointed out how you were different.
[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:57.166]  It's got evil and occult stuff in it too, so it's... Oh yeah, I noticed the perfect lightning bolts of Lucifer.
[01:04:57.166 --> 01:04:59.368]  It's all very loving, loving.
[01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:04.710]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:11.151]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[01:05:11.151 --> 01:05:20.473]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.

[01:05:30.011 --> 01:05:33.672]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:33.672 --> 01:05:37.953]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:37.953 --> 01:05:39.733]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:39.733 --> 01:05:47.575]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:05:47.575 --> 01:05:48.736]  But for how long?
[01:05:48.736 --> 01:05:55.357]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:05:55.357 --> 01:05:58.178]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:05:59.482 --> 01:06:00.443]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:06:00.443 --> 01:06:01.003]  Good, brother.
[01:06:01.003 --> 01:06:02.964]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:06:02.964 --> 01:06:04.685]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:06:04.685 --> 01:06:08.727]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:06:08.727 --> 01:06:11.329]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:06:11.329 --> 01:06:13.750]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:21.615]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:06:21.915 --> 01:06:25.157]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:06:25.157 --> 01:06:26.698]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:06:26.698 --> 01:06:29.739]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:06:29.739 --> 01:06:31.380]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:34.121]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[01:06:34.121 --> 01:06:37.183]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated.
[01:06:37.643 --> 01:06:39.225]  Maximum potency.
[01:06:39.225 --> 01:06:51.239]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience where it's stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source so it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:06:51.239 --> 01:06:58.187]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:06:59.369 --> 01:07:08.352]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[01:07:08.352 --> 01:07:18.895]  This ultra-clean Vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[01:07:18.895 --> 01:07:24.957]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:07:25.317 --> 01:07:31.721]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:07:31.721 --> 01:07:40.327]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[01:07:40.327 --> 01:07:43.409]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:07:43.409 --> 01:07:44.930]  No needles, no injections.
[01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:46.331]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:07:46.331 --> 01:07:47.532]  Try it for yourself.
[01:07:47.532 --> 01:07:49.954]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.
[01:07:49.954 --> 01:07:52.275]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.
[01:07:52.275 --> 01:07:54.677]  Secure yours today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:57.018 --> 01:08:09.565]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.565 --> 01:08:20.492]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:20.492 --> 01:08:23.954]  NSA Whistleblower, InfoWars.com, Red Link Story.
[01:08:26.078 --> 01:08:30.139]  America is no longer a country with a government.
[01:08:30.139 --> 01:08:33.480]  We're a government with a country.
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:38.161]  The country has been captured by the government and the special interests have captured that government.
[01:08:38.161 --> 01:08:41.142]  We are, by every definition, a captured country.
[01:08:41.142 --> 01:08:47.504]  But the public is starting to see through it on many, many levels.
[01:08:47.504 --> 01:08:51.104]  Democratic support for Hillary is plummeting.
[01:08:51.104 --> 01:08:52.605]  New Hampshire voters have panned Bush.
[01:08:55.595 --> 01:09:03.060]  Jeb Bush still refuses to nix tax hikes, even though we've already seen huge ones, under Obama.
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:10.324]  Major magazines are saying both the Clintons and the Bushes are past their expiration dates.
[01:09:10.324 --> 01:09:13.286]  Clinton's in trouble running her own separate intel operation.
[01:09:16.837 --> 01:09:18.638]  So there's some good news on that front.
[01:09:18.638 --> 01:09:22.341]  Obama plots to bypass Yetnyahu with U.N.
[01:09:22.341 --> 01:09:24.403]  action on the Palestinians.
[01:09:24.403 --> 01:09:31.548]  And again, folks, whether you're for the Palestinians or against them, it's all a big tragedy, and I wish for peace there, but the U.N.
[01:09:31.548 --> 01:09:33.750]  and the globalists could care less about the Palestinians.
[01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:36.352]  It uses a political football.
[01:09:36.352 --> 01:09:38.574]  This is about promoting U.N.
[01:09:38.574 --> 01:09:41.916]  as the great arbiter of liberty and freedom and justice.
[01:09:42.793 --> 01:09:45.634]  We're going to be breaking that down coming up.
[01:09:45.634 --> 01:09:50.196]  UN panel is considering, quote, US failure on civil rights.
[01:09:50.196 --> 01:09:52.797]  We might get sanctioned by the UN too.
[01:09:52.797 --> 01:09:56.539]  That's where all of this is going.
[01:09:56.539 --> 01:09:59.740]  The new crime is that whole countries are guilty of racism.
[01:10:01.206 --> 01:10:13.130]  But if you're China and have forced abortions and forced infanticide at Foxconn factories and suicide nets and forced drugging and your government kills 80 plus million people, well, they're all Chinese, so it's okay.
[01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:16.591]  As long as Chinese kill Chinese, it's okay.
[01:10:16.591 --> 01:10:19.672]  As long as black kills black 9 out of 10 times, it's okay.
[01:10:19.672 --> 01:10:22.253]  Just if white kills black.
[01:10:22.253 --> 01:10:25.794]  That's what this is, is mass mental illness where you don't have common sense.
[01:10:25.794 --> 01:10:26.795]  Having common sense
[01:10:28.103 --> 01:10:32.967]  He's like being some sort of superhero now with superpowers.
[01:10:32.967 --> 01:10:43.235]  And seeing through how the system just wants a bunch of confused, dumbed down... Can we get a promo made cutting out the profanity of the late, great George Carlin?
[01:10:46.069 --> 01:10:49.331]  Not that I'm against his free speech, we just can't air it here with the FCC.
[01:10:49.331 --> 01:11:05.062]  I mean they can teach white privilege conference workshop in federally funded in Kentucky teaching a lesson about genderqueer and transgender folks to five-year-olds which have no business sexualizing confusing children.
[01:11:05.062 --> 01:11:06.904]  They're not asking sexual questions at that age.
[01:11:08.746 --> 01:11:16.133]  Put it this way, if a man walks up to five-year-olds at a fence in the backyard and says, hey, I want to talk to you about sex, he's called being a pedophile.
[01:11:16.133 --> 01:11:17.835]  When the government does it, oh, it's no big deal.
[01:11:17.835 --> 01:11:19.537]  And I told you this was the case.
[01:11:19.537 --> 01:11:21.879]  Now government's coming out in Australia, the U.S.
[01:11:21.879 --> 01:11:24.462]  and England and saying, you know what?
[01:11:24.462 --> 01:11:27.505]  Judges and others are coming out and saying, you know what?
[01:11:27.505 --> 01:11:29.146]  Pedophilia is not illegal, it's love.
[01:11:30.151 --> 01:11:32.835]  And children can love, too, and they have a right.
[01:11:32.835 --> 01:11:40.104]  Really, does a 10-year-old have a right to be picked up, whether it's a boy or girl or whatever, by a 25-year-old or a 30-year-old?
[01:11:40.104 --> 01:11:42.507]  No, because they don't have the age of consent.
[01:11:42.507 --> 01:11:45.931]  That's why you can't give your neighbor kids whiskey when they're 14.
[01:11:45.931 --> 01:11:46.592]  You'll get arrested.
[01:11:48.305 --> 01:11:55.168]  That's why you can't get them to sign a contract signing over their paycheck when they're 16, because they're not at the age of consent yet until you're 18.
[01:11:55.168 --> 01:12:03.672]  Because we found, historically, you make bad decisions until you're 18, and you still make bad decisions after that.
[01:12:03.672 --> 01:12:06.534]  That's why cons target young people more than anybody.
[01:12:06.534 --> 01:12:09.095]  Then they target above-80, senile folks.
[01:12:10.182 --> 01:12:13.743]  And that's why Obama is in the news, and that's coming up as well.
[01:12:13.743 --> 01:12:16.164]  Infowars.com, we have the video.
[01:12:16.164 --> 01:12:29.390]  It would be transformative if everybody voted, he said, wants to make it the law for mandatory voting, and San Francisco and other lib groups want to get voting down to 16, and then down to even younger after that.
[01:12:30.609 --> 01:12:38.175]  Most 16-year-olds I talk to are either super awake and super cool, that's probably 10% of them, or they don't know what planet they're on.
[01:12:38.175 --> 01:12:45.161]  And we've got a report about millennials, all they know about is race now.
[01:12:45.161 --> 01:12:53.207]  Or sexual gender, and all these weird PC words, and they've reduced their language down to hashtag terms.
[01:12:53.207 --> 01:12:54.628]  And of course most of them didn't breastfeed.
[01:12:55.876 --> 01:12:59.579]  Study out breastfeeding pays babies who nurse earn more as adults.
[01:12:59.579 --> 01:13:01.560]  Study finds, yeah, 39% more.
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:02.321]  And you know why?
[01:13:02.321 --> 01:13:07.125]  Because their brains are bigger and wired right.
[01:13:07.125 --> 01:13:08.326]  And I'm not knocking parents.
[01:13:08.326 --> 01:13:10.727]  A lot of parents didn't breastfeed, so now they feel guilty.
[01:13:10.727 --> 01:13:12.169]  Or you had an abortion, so you feel guilty.
[01:13:12.169 --> 01:13:13.590]  Nobody's judged.
[01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:15.171]  So your son or daughter has 120 IQ.
[01:13:15.171 --> 01:13:16.312]  That would have been 160.
[01:13:16.312 --> 01:13:18.754]  It's okay.
[01:13:18.754 --> 01:13:20.495]  You can warn others now.
[01:13:20.495 --> 01:13:21.956]  Now if your kid was going to have 100, now they got an 80.
[01:13:24.551 --> 01:13:30.574]  I guess 39% would be lower, now it's going to be 70.
[01:13:30.574 --> 01:13:34.236]  That's why you talk to a lot of people, they ain't there, they got little shriveled brains at age 20.
[01:13:34.236 --> 01:13:47.203]  I mean, I've seen the CAT scan studies, I've had them for decades out there on people, brain scans, people that were fed formula, and the formula they give third world kids, the brain's even smaller.
[01:13:48.482 --> 01:13:53.446]  And so basically you wonder why third world people and others that are, you know, in the major cities that are on the free U.N.
[01:13:53.446 --> 01:13:54.987]  formula that kills so many kids.
[01:13:54.987 --> 01:13:56.027]  Remember those scandals?
[01:13:56.027 --> 01:13:59.510]  Oh, the formula killed, you know, 20,000 kids in Nigeria.
[01:13:59.510 --> 01:14:00.110]  Numbers like that.
[01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:01.672]  I mean, I don't remember the exact numbers.
[01:14:01.672 --> 01:14:02.772]  It was in the tens of thousands.
[01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:05.034]  Guys, look up bad formula kills thousands.
[01:14:05.034 --> 01:14:06.875]  I mean, it's always the U.N.
[01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:09.417]  and India and Africa and Asia and Latin America.
[01:14:09.417 --> 01:14:13.260]  Oh, they come in with all this free formula and then, oh, it didn't have enough protein.
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:13.720]  Sorry.
[01:14:15.161 --> 01:14:17.603]  The baby couldn't tell you until they were two.
[01:14:17.603 --> 01:14:19.004]  We wonder why you never got out of the crib.
[01:14:19.004 --> 01:14:23.187]  The brain's one half the size it should be.
[01:14:23.187 --> 01:14:29.911]  You were given a lobotomy by lack of calories and lack of protein and lack of fat.
[01:14:29.911 --> 01:14:32.493]  And you wonder why there's so many Alzheimer patients now?
[01:14:32.493 --> 01:14:36.015]  Because they're on low-fat diets and then all the aluminum and the rest of it.
[01:14:36.015 --> 01:14:37.016]  You're dead.
[01:14:37.016 --> 01:14:38.297]  You're dead already.
[01:14:39.611 --> 01:14:42.793]  So I understand a lot of new listeners out there can't even understand a word I'm saying.
[01:14:42.793 --> 01:14:46.295]  I don't talk real slow and I use complex words.
[01:14:46.295 --> 01:14:51.278]  It sounds like I slipped on a thesaurus when I grew up, but there it is.
[01:14:51.278 --> 01:14:54.820]  China tightens baby formula rules after NZ poisoning scare.
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:56.241]  That's out of Bloomberg.
[01:14:56.241 --> 01:15:04.406]  I remember some headline years ago, like, you know, 20,000 kids died over a multi-year period.
[01:15:04.406 --> 01:15:04.867]  But, um,
[01:15:06.493 --> 01:15:10.056]  I want to get into the economy real quick, and then I'll get into all that and take your phone calls.
[01:15:10.056 --> 01:15:14.940]  The toll-free number to join us on this live Thursday worldwide broadcast, first-time callers again, is 800-259-9231.
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:15.801]  800-259-9231 will get you up and on the air.
[01:15:15.801 --> 01:15:15.901]  800-259-9231.
[01:15:15.901 --> 01:15:18.784]  And if you disagree calling, you go to the head of the line.
[01:15:29.568 --> 01:15:31.449]  Maybe I'm being a little extreme here.
[01:15:31.449 --> 01:15:38.473]  Maybe having kids with satanic symbols and bloated dead DU babies around McDonald's with McDonald's signs on them is no big deal.
[01:15:38.473 --> 01:15:45.157]  Maybe going to Starbucks to get coffee and being lectured about white privilege is normal, even though they admit it's a re-education camp program.
[01:15:45.157 --> 01:15:48.019]  Maybe the government ruling by executive fiat is normal.
[01:15:48.019 --> 01:15:51.261]  Maybe the new announcement of what I'm about to get to on the derivatives is no big deal.
[01:15:53.564 --> 01:16:05.512]  Maybe having all the major TV companies and car companies and world leaders announcing that we're going to ban humans driving cars soon and everything you're doing is being watched and there's cameras in your TV watching you.
[01:16:05.512 --> 01:16:07.013]  Yes, we're listening to you.
[01:16:07.013 --> 01:16:08.874]  Yes, ha ha ha.
[01:16:08.874 --> 01:16:11.496]  Yes, we're going to stop labeling the GMOs.
[01:16:11.496 --> 01:16:15.759]  Yes, we're not going to label the drugs and the vaccines anymore and even let you know what's in the insert.
[01:16:15.759 --> 01:16:16.259]  Ha ha ha.
[01:16:16.479 --> 01:16:17.560]  We're going to make it mandatory.
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:18.361]  Ha ha ha.
[01:16:18.361 --> 01:16:19.121]  Everything's fine.
[01:16:19.121 --> 01:16:19.682]  Ha ha ha.
[01:16:19.682 --> 01:16:20.443]  The border's wide open.
[01:16:20.443 --> 01:16:24.086]  We're going to give the illegals everything free and free babies and free ha ha ha.
[01:16:24.086 --> 01:16:26.668]  It's just more fresh meat for the meat grinder.
[01:16:26.668 --> 01:16:31.332]  And yes, we're going to put the troops on a secret death list and actually let them die of stuff that's totally treatable.
[01:16:31.332 --> 01:16:32.353]  Ha, it's totally normal.
[01:16:32.353 --> 01:16:35.556]  Everything's fine.
[01:16:35.556 --> 01:16:37.157]  I mean, this is what we're dealing with.
[01:16:37.157 --> 01:16:38.138]  Rob Dew just came in.
[01:16:38.138 --> 01:16:38.799]  Rob, do you want to talk?
[01:16:39.656 --> 01:16:42.323]  Yeah Alex, I just found this article.
[01:16:42.323 --> 01:16:43.405]  We get to have nap time.
[01:16:43.405 --> 01:16:44.207]  It's on Daily Mail.
[01:16:44.207 --> 01:16:48.919]  Stressed out adults are paying thousands of dollars to attend the world's first preschool for grown-ups.
[01:16:49.639 --> 01:16:52.580]  I mean, it's just getting, we're degenerating.
[01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:54.041]  They're teaching mental illness.
[01:16:54.041 --> 01:17:10.868]  I mean, I met with a top psychiatrist slash psychologist who is a multi-millionaire and owned a radio station when I was in Minnesota and he was revealing to me 15 years ago with Ted Anderson, he wanted to meet with us, that he was there at the corporate level talking about the plan to screw the kids up.
[01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:12.791]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:17:12.791 --> 01:17:14.132]  We get to have nap time.
[01:17:14.132 --> 01:17:19.055]  Stressed out adults are paying thousands of dollars to attend the world's very first preschool for grown-ups.
[01:17:19.055 --> 01:17:19.795]  Exactly.
[01:17:19.795 --> 01:17:22.197]  That's the hottest thing in Japan five years running.
[01:17:22.197 --> 01:17:22.917]  Yeah, wearing diapers.
[01:17:22.917 --> 01:17:24.798]  Is to wear diapers and poop on yourself.
[01:17:24.798 --> 01:17:25.499]  Yeah, it's just...
[01:17:26.428 --> 01:17:29.772]  They're taking the adult, they're making the age of becoming an adult later and later.
[01:17:29.772 --> 01:17:36.118]  It used to be, you know, 12, 13, these kids were adults working, you know, doing stuff, helping out with the family, and now it's, now it's 18.
[01:17:36.118 --> 01:17:38.180]  You have to be 18 before you can do anything.
[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:38.981]  Well, actually, now it's 35.
[01:17:38.981 --> 01:17:40.643]  I saw a headline, 35 is the new adult.
[01:17:42.912 --> 01:17:43.893]  Yeah.
[01:17:43.893 --> 01:17:46.074]  And they're making it later and later and later.
[01:17:46.074 --> 01:17:50.296]  And I run into full-grown men everywhere that act like five-year-olds and I want to knock their teeth out.
[01:17:50.296 --> 01:17:50.756]  Yeah.
[01:17:50.756 --> 01:17:56.299]  I mean, when I was 14, man, I was, you know, I'd already had more living than the average, you know.
[01:17:56.299 --> 01:17:57.440]  I'm not studying matter.
[01:17:58.461 --> 01:17:59.242]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:17:59.242 --> 01:18:00.624]  They don't know what they're missing out on, man.
[01:18:14.884 --> 01:18:20.626]  That I was not going to be... I mean, my dad was not a Mr. Macho tough guy, but I'd come home with black eyes after bullies beat me up when I was 11.
[01:18:20.626 --> 01:18:22.466]  He'd say, you better fight harder next time.
[01:18:22.466 --> 01:18:25.227]  He didn't call the police, but I had loose teeth and black eyes.
[01:18:25.227 --> 01:18:28.808]  And I'm telling you that, I just thank God I was brought up like that, dude.
[01:18:28.808 --> 01:18:30.348]  Well, there was a story the other day.
[01:18:30.348 --> 01:18:34.009]  A lady calls the cops to come teach her son about stealing.
[01:18:34.009 --> 01:18:36.250]  Eight-year-old stole some money out of the purse.
[01:18:36.250 --> 01:18:43.712]  They ended up, one of the cops got mad and started calling her, you know, U-Black-B-I-T-C-H and arrested her.
[01:18:44.448 --> 01:18:45.889]  For wasting their time.
[01:18:45.889 --> 01:18:49.092]  But it's like, you don't call the cops for something stupid like that.
[01:18:49.092 --> 01:18:51.153]  The cops are trained now to arrest people.
[01:18:51.153 --> 01:18:52.574]  They're trained to bring in revenue.
[01:18:52.574 --> 01:18:54.536]  So they're looking at you as a milk cow.
[01:18:54.536 --> 01:18:58.980]  And when you call them in to, oh, I'm going to teach my son a lesson and have the cops, you know... What about the ladies?
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:02.062]  Big Mac was cold, so they called the cops.
[01:19:02.062 --> 01:19:02.903]  It's ridiculous.
[01:19:02.903 --> 01:19:05.164]  You know, people think that the cops are going to solve your problems.
[01:19:05.164 --> 01:19:06.906]  They're not there to solve your problems.
[01:19:06.906 --> 01:19:08.787]  Well, notice, don't, don't discipline your kid.
[01:19:08.787 --> 01:19:11.409]  But then when they grow up to be a delinquent, the cops kill them.
[01:19:11.409 --> 01:19:12.010]  Or taser them.
[01:19:12.554 --> 01:19:13.195]  Yeah.
[01:19:13.195 --> 01:19:15.077]  No, it's just par for the course.
[01:19:15.077 --> 01:19:17.880]  I'm working on a report right now.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:25.468]  I went and shot some detailed shots of all those aborted dead babies, DU babies, around the McDonald's.
[01:19:25.468 --> 01:19:31.175]  And I've found photographs that compare them exactly like the one-eyed thing with the eye in the middle.
[01:19:31.175 --> 01:19:33.858]  No, it's clear the show got it from DU Iraq babies.
[01:19:34.198 --> 01:19:34.839]  Yeah.
[01:19:34.839 --> 01:19:35.879]  No, it's disgusting.
[01:19:35.879 --> 01:19:39.182]  So I'll have a report for that tonight for the nightly news.
[01:19:39.182 --> 01:19:40.363]  I'm going to take some of what you said today.
[01:19:40.363 --> 01:19:43.345]  I think you just spelled it out really clearly.
[01:19:43.345 --> 01:19:50.691]  And people and then, you know, this this whole when you walk around South by everybody's walking around looking for free stuff.
[01:19:50.691 --> 01:19:51.852]  It's just it's a it's a
[01:19:53.484 --> 01:19:55.046]  What do we call it?
[01:19:55.046 --> 01:19:56.568]  Did Joe Biggs want to comment on something?
[01:19:56.568 --> 01:19:57.269]  I see him there.
[01:19:57.269 --> 01:19:59.913]  He's got something he's going to talk to you about during the break.
[01:19:59.913 --> 01:20:01.655]  Hey, sorry I'm running late.
[01:20:01.655 --> 01:20:03.778]  I had to stop and get my vitamins for the month.
[01:20:03.778 --> 01:20:07.083]  I got mine in the mail yesterday from DiscountNutritionShop.com.
[01:20:07.083 --> 01:20:08.485]  So I'm here totally on time.

[01:22:03.659 --> 01:22:04.300]  It's true.
[01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:08.442]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.

[01:24:07.334 --> 01:24:09.637]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:11.642 --> 01:24:13.903]  Boy, we couldn't have a better intro coming in.
[01:24:13.903 --> 01:24:14.724]  That wasn't planned.
[01:24:14.724 --> 01:24:16.265]  That just auto-played.
[01:24:16.265 --> 01:24:18.507]  We've got huge breaking news, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:18.507 --> 01:24:21.349]  It's going to be happening in Austin's back door.
[01:24:21.349 --> 01:24:23.491]  Joe Biggs, combat vet, U.S.
[01:24:23.491 --> 01:24:25.693]  Army, Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:24:25.693 --> 01:24:37.162]  We were sent by one of our insiders, one of my insiders, a very good source, in, let's just say, in telecoms, in the whole NSA area.
[01:24:38.248 --> 01:24:39.209]  This is sensational news.
[01:24:54.628 --> 01:24:59.350]  They want to hide this as a PSYOP in plain view for the troops to brainwash them, the local police and the citizens.
[01:24:59.350 --> 01:25:04.532]  They say this is to gain the hearts and minds of the people of Texas.
[01:25:04.532 --> 01:25:09.554]  They're doing these all over the country and Texas is one of the only states in the US on the map.
[01:25:09.554 --> 01:25:10.575]  Do they have it to pull up in there?
[01:25:10.575 --> 01:25:11.375]  This is sensational.
[01:25:11.375 --> 01:25:12.336]  I want people to see.
[01:25:12.336 --> 01:25:15.397]  Texas is listed in red as a hostile sector.
[01:25:15.397 --> 01:25:17.158]  I told you I'm deep behind enemy lines, folks.
[01:25:18.573 --> 01:25:21.195]  We are listed as a hostile sector.
[01:25:21.195 --> 01:25:27.478]  They're having Delta Force, Navy SEALs with the Army trained to basically take over.
[01:25:27.478 --> 01:25:30.020]  This is over the top.
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:32.841]  Texas is listed as a hostile sector.
[01:25:32.841 --> 01:25:33.582]  Of course we are.
[01:25:33.582 --> 01:25:35.803]  We're here defending the Republic.
[01:25:35.803 --> 01:25:37.244]  And the military's awake.
[01:25:37.244 --> 01:25:38.245]  This is what's waking them up.
[01:25:38.991 --> 01:25:41.853]  But my gosh, Joe, we just got this information.
[01:25:41.853 --> 01:25:46.938]  They actually admit it's a PSYOP and it's public, but no one knew about it.
[01:25:46.938 --> 01:25:52.082]  Thank God our, let's just say, intel friends sent us this.
[01:25:52.082 --> 01:25:52.402]  U.S.
[01:25:52.402 --> 01:25:55.284]  Army Special Operations, unclassified.
[01:25:55.284 --> 01:25:58.207]  And let's give people the code number up there at the top.
[01:25:58.207 --> 01:25:59.108]  Joe, tell folks about this.
[01:25:59.648 --> 01:26:02.130]  Alright, so this is a request to conduct realistic military training.
[01:26:02.130 --> 01:26:04.751]  The operation is going to be called Jade Helm 15.
[01:26:04.751 --> 01:26:13.557]  The commander of the United States Army Special Operations Command seeks a written invitation and approval from local law officials to conduct realistic military training.
[01:26:13.557 --> 01:26:18.840]  So, like I said, this is going to be realistic military training conducted outside of federally owned property.
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.581]  Outside Camp Swift and Bastrop.
[01:26:20.581 --> 01:26:23.063]  This will be in American citizens' backyards.
[01:26:23.922 --> 01:26:26.764]  So it says it'll be conducting all kinds of role-playing.
[01:26:26.764 --> 01:26:34.389]  It is a challenging eight-week joint military and interagency unconventional warfare exercise conducted throughout Texas.
[01:26:34.389 --> 01:26:40.613]  Now, like I said, this operation will be running from July 15th to 15th, September, and the participants will be U.S.
[01:26:40.613 --> 01:26:41.914]  Army Special Forces, U.S.
[01:26:41.914 --> 01:26:43.175]  Navy SEALs, U.S.
[01:26:43.175 --> 01:26:48.979]  Air Force Special Operations Command, U.S.MC Marine Special Operations Command, the Marine Expeditionary Unit.
[01:26:48.979 --> 01:26:53.402]  This is a NORTHCOM joint forces warfare planning operation.
[01:26:54.002 --> 01:26:54.804]  Yeah.
[01:26:54.804 --> 01:26:55.525]  Keep going.
[01:26:55.525 --> 01:26:58.350]  And this is, like you said, it's going to be a complete and total psyop.
[01:26:58.350 --> 01:27:02.277]  And one of the main things that I saw when I was looking at this, it lists Texas in red.
[01:27:02.277 --> 01:27:04.481]  And when you look at the legend, it says red is hostile.
[01:27:05.652 --> 01:27:17.818]  So for some reason, Texas is red, but then when you go on, it says to hone advanced skills in military interagency, require large areas of undeveloped land with low population densities with access to towns.
[01:27:17.818 --> 01:27:23.320]  The opportunity to work with civilians to gain their trust and understanding of the issues.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:27.422]  They want to adapt an unfamiliar terrain, social and economic conditions.
[01:27:27.422 --> 01:27:32.985]  Operations will happen in and around communities where anything out of the ordinary will be spotted and reported.
[01:27:34.138 --> 01:27:36.459]  Completing total PSYOP, through and through, all the way.
[01:27:36.459 --> 01:27:38.599]  And they legalized PSYOPs last year.
[01:27:38.599 --> 01:27:41.140]  They admit they're going to have Brigade Homeland rolling out.
[01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:47.062]  I did that report where the headline was, Pentagon admits drudge, stopping their propaganda.
[01:27:47.062 --> 01:27:52.544]  In that video announcement, they admit they're going to be engaging in PSYOP and military takeover domestically.
[01:27:52.544 --> 01:27:54.845]  This is in preparation for the financial collapse.
[01:27:55.405 --> 01:27:57.406]  And maybe even Obama not leaving office.
[01:27:57.406 --> 01:27:59.107]  I mean, I'm telling you, this is so huge.
[01:27:59.107 --> 01:28:03.288]  There will be 1,200 service members participating in Operation Jade Helm.
[01:28:03.288 --> 01:28:09.191]  It says increase military presence, increase aircraft in the area at night.
[01:28:09.191 --> 01:28:10.472]  They may receive noise complaints.
[01:28:10.472 --> 01:28:16.674]  Some individuals may conduct suspicious activities designed to prepare them for complex environment overseas.
[01:28:16.674 --> 01:28:17.775]  Did you hear that?
[01:28:17.775 --> 01:28:19.655]  They're going to practice breaking into things and stuff.
[01:28:19.655 --> 01:28:20.496]  This is going to be hellish.
[01:28:20.976 --> 01:28:22.497]  Personnel may be carrying weapons.
[01:28:22.497 --> 01:28:26.878]  Some participants will be wearing civilian attire and driving civilian vehicles.
[01:28:26.878 --> 01:28:29.519]  And this is just a cover for deploying the military on the streets.
[01:28:29.519 --> 01:28:33.500]  You notice Texas is listed as hostile there for their drill.
[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:34.720]  Yeah.
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:37.601]  So I think it's a good thing that we get out there and cover this.
[01:28:37.601 --> 01:28:39.402]  Oh, we're gonna be all over it.
[01:28:39.402 --> 01:28:39.842]  Yeah.
[01:28:39.842 --> 01:28:43.943]  Because part of it in the document is out at Camp Swift there in Smithville and other areas.
[01:28:43.943 --> 01:28:47.284]  But we have the Army sources and the Texas Guard sources.
[01:28:47.284 --> 01:28:48.205]  We're gonna be all over this.
[01:28:48.205 --> 01:28:48.725]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[01:28:50.669 --> 01:28:52.651]  I was told about this stuff going on at Fort Hood a few years ago.
[01:28:52.651 --> 01:28:55.173]  That's what really upset the PSYOPs people out there.
[01:28:55.173 --> 01:28:58.956]  Well, I mean, the thing for me, though, is just the amount of the participants.
[01:28:58.956 --> 01:29:01.398]  I mean, this is the entire Special Operations Command.
[01:29:01.398 --> 01:29:03.219]  This isn't just... This is an invasion.
[01:29:03.219 --> 01:29:04.460]  This isn't just Delta Force.
[01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:05.601]  I mean, this is everybody.
[01:29:05.601 --> 01:29:07.003]  And this isn't tabletop.
[01:29:07.003 --> 01:29:10.806]  I've hardly ever heard of something joint like this unless they're actually planning an invasion.
[01:29:11.266 --> 01:29:14.209]  Yeah, this is a large, large operation on a big scale.
[01:29:14.209 --> 01:29:16.811]  I mean, this is going to affect a lot of stuff.
[01:29:16.811 --> 01:29:23.377]  And like you said, the whole point is, is they want to... If Putin was putting this, one half of this, on the Ukrainian border, it'd be international news.
[01:29:23.377 --> 01:29:23.657]  Yeah.
[01:29:23.657 --> 01:29:24.678]  Instead, they're putting it on our border.
[01:29:26.781 --> 01:29:28.562]  Joe, I want you to do a detailed report.
[01:29:28.562 --> 01:29:30.384]  I mean, this is sensational.
[01:29:30.384 --> 01:29:32.845]  They hope it just, you know, comes out there like it's no big deal.
[01:29:32.845 --> 01:29:40.671]  The headline is, Northcom prepares all military forces or all branches to invade Texas.
[01:29:40.671 --> 01:29:45.014]  Texas listed as hostile enemy by Northcom and Special Forces Command.
[01:29:45.014 --> 01:29:47.075]  They prepare invasion drill of Texas.
[01:29:47.075 --> 01:29:48.496]  Feds preparing to invade Texas.
[01:29:48.496 --> 01:29:49.056]  We'll be back.
[01:29:49.056 --> 01:29:49.417]  Stay with us.
[01:29:49.417 --> 01:29:50.778]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.778 --> 01:29:52.279]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.279 --> 01:29:55.781]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:55.781 --> 01:29:57.182]  Tied into the TSA blockade threats.
[01:29:57.182 --> 01:30:00.325]  Remember that, Joe?
[01:30:00.325 --> 01:30:06.429]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[01:30:06.429 --> 01:30:11.013]  Introducing the new InfoWarsLife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.

[01:30:45.942 --> 01:30:51.084]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[01:31:00.029 --> 01:31:01.290]  Another major health threat.
[01:31:01.290 --> 01:31:06.274]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:31:06.274 --> 01:31:08.936]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:31:08.936 --> 01:31:15.981]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:31:15.981 --> 01:31:18.963]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:31:18.963 --> 01:31:21.925]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:31:21.925 --> 01:31:23.947]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:31:23.947 --> 01:31:26.809]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:31:26.869 --> 01:31:32.590]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:31:32.590 --> 01:31:36.091]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:31:36.091 --> 01:31:39.192]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[01:32:00.928 --> 01:32:02.249]  In the near future.
[01:32:02.249 --> 01:32:06.751]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:32:06.751 --> 01:32:07.972]  Security, alert.
[01:32:07.972 --> 01:32:09.973]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:32:09.973 --> 01:32:13.575]  Analysis, InfoWars, building independent media operations.
[01:32:13.575 --> 01:32:18.578]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:32:18.578 --> 01:32:21.159]  Prime Directive, take credit, Alex Jones.
[01:32:21.159 --> 01:32:24.021]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:32:24.021 --> 01:32:27.243]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:32:27.243 --> 01:32:29.424]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:29.724 --> 01:32:31.065]  People are assaulting us.
[01:32:31.065 --> 01:32:33.226]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:32:33.226 --> 01:32:35.847]  They are never going to stop.
[01:32:35.847 --> 01:32:39.889]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:32:46.832 --> 01:32:47.832]  Imperative.
[01:32:47.832 --> 01:32:49.853]  Destroy Little Planet TV.
[01:32:49.853 --> 01:32:54.556]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:32:54.556 --> 01:32:55.936]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:32:55.936 --> 01:32:56.657]  You can feel it.
[01:33:17.575 --> 01:33:22.019]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:33:22.019 --> 01:33:24.041]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:30.615 --> 01:33:33.155]  Sorcerers of death's construction.
[01:33:33.155 --> 01:33:36.296]  In the fields, the body's burning.
[01:33:36.296 --> 01:33:41.757]  As the war machine... Death and hatred to mankind.
[01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:04.324]  Poisoning.
[01:34:04.324 --> 01:34:09.068]  Poisoning their brainwashed minds.
[01:34:09.068 --> 01:34:14.272]  I think the bass player that wrote this knew what he was talking about.
[01:34:14.272 --> 01:34:16.134]  Poisoning their brainwashed minds.
[01:34:16.134 --> 01:34:22.299]  We are being poisoned by psychological, spiritual, chemical, biological, and positronic attacks.
[01:34:23.456 --> 01:34:24.516]  It's all admitted.
[01:34:24.516 --> 01:34:25.757]  It's all hidden in plain view.
[01:34:25.757 --> 01:34:27.698]  It's all admitted your TV is watching you.
[01:34:27.698 --> 01:34:33.260]  It's all admitted that it won't be like Maximum Overdrive or Robo-Apocalypse where the machines come after us.
[01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:39.582]  The machines are wired into the globalist hubs to dominate and control us.
[01:34:39.582 --> 01:34:42.203]  I want to go to Rick, Bailey, Mike, Max, John and others.
[01:34:42.203 --> 01:34:47.645]  I would have gone to you earlier, but we had breaking news.
[01:34:47.645 --> 01:34:49.666]  It says that it's PSYOP in the document.
[01:34:50.932 --> 01:34:51.996]  Joe Beggs was just covering.
[01:34:51.996 --> 01:34:53.803]  I mean, it just gets crazier by the minute.
[01:34:56.072 --> 01:34:59.594]  And the military is training all over the country for gun confiscation for coordinating U.S.
[01:34:59.594 --> 01:34:59.914]  cities.
[01:34:59.914 --> 01:35:02.155]  And of course they can argue it's for overseas as well.
[01:35:02.155 --> 01:35:04.016]  This is all to condition us.
[01:35:04.016 --> 01:35:07.078]  They have giant military training bases at Fort Hood right up the road.
[01:35:07.078 --> 01:35:08.779]  They have huge facilities everywhere.
[01:35:08.779 --> 01:35:10.740]  This is about preparing the public.
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:12.361]  And it says in the document.
[01:35:12.361 --> 01:35:15.503]  Preparing the public to work with us and be around us.
[01:35:15.503 --> 01:35:18.224]  This is for the Red Dawn occupation.
[01:35:18.224 --> 01:35:20.906]  But most importantly it's to get the military used to it.
[01:35:22.927 --> 01:35:24.128]  Well, let me give U.S.
[01:35:24.128 --> 01:35:28.171]  Army Special Operations Command a little newsflash, if you don't already know it.
[01:35:28.171 --> 01:35:35.336]  We told everybody this was coming 20 years ago, when it was already going on on a very small scale, preparing cadres.
[01:35:35.336 --> 01:35:37.278]  That's how cancer grows, very small.
[01:35:37.278 --> 01:35:41.721]  Now, it's ready to give birth, nine months pregnant, and we're not flat-footed.
[01:35:41.721 --> 01:35:44.863]  We know you're coming in.
[01:35:44.863 --> 01:35:45.824]  And so, bring it!
[01:35:45.824 --> 01:35:46.705]  Bring your conditioning.
[01:35:46.705 --> 01:35:48.306]  Put troops on the streets.
[01:35:48.306 --> 01:35:49.467]  Put your TSA on the streets.
[01:35:51.394 --> 01:35:52.995]  Tell us the TVs are watching us.
[01:35:52.995 --> 01:35:54.456]  Put cameras in the cars.
[01:35:54.456 --> 01:35:56.837]  Just go ahead, show everybody.
[01:35:56.837 --> 01:35:59.339]  Go ahead and take the vaccine inserts out so we can't show them folks.
[01:35:59.339 --> 01:36:00.500]  Go ahead!
[01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:01.700]  Go ahead!
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:03.141]  Go ahead!
[01:36:03.141 --> 01:36:09.385]  The veterans know that their uncles and fathers and brothers and sisters have got out of the military and are put on do-not-treat lists.
[01:36:09.385 --> 01:36:11.707]  They know they're getting treated like crap.
[01:36:11.707 --> 01:36:14.248]  They know they're planning to be replaced with machines soon.
[01:36:14.248 --> 01:36:15.309]  Go ahead, push it all.
[01:36:17.079 --> 01:36:18.380]  I want to hit this next group of stories.
[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:25.963]  We're going right back to your calls, but this is who runs the show that we're about to cover.
[01:36:25.963 --> 01:36:27.904]  These stories all tie together.
[01:36:27.904 --> 01:36:31.886]  Fed opens door wider for rate hike, but downgrades economic outlook.
[01:36:31.886 --> 01:36:32.586]  Let's stop right there.
[01:36:32.586 --> 01:36:37.248]  They've been giving themselves trillions of QE to the private banks, zero percent or lower.
[01:36:39.072 --> 01:36:44.036]  The general public doesn't get cheap credit because they don't want to cause inflation, plus they want to screw everybody over.
[01:36:44.036 --> 01:36:48.960]  Because if you're going to do this dollar devaluation, might as well let people run the economy and build something up to do it.
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:50.561]  At least you get something out of that.
[01:36:50.561 --> 01:36:53.423]  Not hyper-stag inflation they're trying to cook up.
[01:36:53.423 --> 01:36:54.444]  That's totally unnatural.
[01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:59.641]  Swedish Central Bank cuts key rate further below zero.
[01:36:59.641 --> 01:37:00.262]  The U.S.
[01:37:00.262 --> 01:37:03.463]  globalist system doing this has the world racing to lower interest rates.
[01:37:03.463 --> 01:37:08.204]  Swedish Central Bank took its key interest rate further into negative territory Wednesday.
[01:37:08.204 --> 01:37:10.825]  They make you pay to put money in the bank.
[01:37:10.825 --> 01:37:14.286]  In a surprise move aimed at supporting a return to inflation.
[01:37:14.286 --> 01:37:16.927]  Because there's a global depression.
[01:37:16.927 --> 01:37:23.970]  Now that ties into the big kahuna here from Max Slavo up on InfoWars.com from the You-Know-What-Hit-The-Plan site.
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:27.441]  Bailout is back.
[01:37:27.441 --> 01:37:32.463]  Fannie and Freddie likely need additional treasury investment after derivatives losses.
[01:37:32.463 --> 01:37:39.066]  Derivatives are bigger now, look at the graphs, we're going to go to some of those, than they were in 2008 now.
[01:37:39.066 --> 01:37:42.628]  Gotta love that reform.
[01:37:42.628 --> 01:37:48.571]  There is trouble again for federal mortgage backers and bailout queens Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[01:37:49.577 --> 01:37:52.938]  Yeah, just six months ago they wouldn't give people jumbo loans.
[01:37:52.938 --> 01:37:54.259]  Now they're giving the jumbo loans.
[01:37:54.259 --> 01:37:56.560]  They're giving the small loans out too.
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:00.601]  Jumbo is about $400,000, $500,000 depending on how they rate it.
[01:38:00.601 --> 01:38:03.422]  And they're starting to let that money flow out there a little bit because it's derivatives.
[01:38:03.422 --> 01:38:09.164]  They're selling the houses 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 times over to different chump groups that buy them.
[01:38:09.164 --> 01:38:14.006]  Mainly they're investing your pension funds in them so they can steal them later.
[01:38:14.006 --> 01:38:15.187]  In the name of protecting them.
[01:38:15.187 --> 01:38:18.568]  We know the exact battle plan because we've seen them shake and bake it in other places.
[01:38:19.656 --> 01:38:22.557]  Just like we've seen them do their military drills all over the world.
[01:38:22.557 --> 01:38:27.058]  Rand Corporation wrote handbooks on it in the 50s, how to train folks for military occupation.
[01:38:27.058 --> 01:38:31.079]  We've played Army PSYOP drill footage, declassified in the 80s here.
[01:38:31.079 --> 01:38:41.322]  In fact, when Joe Biggs cuts that report, guys, pull up the clips we never had in the Obama deception, too, of the Army internal PSYOP brainwashing films on how to occupy a country.
[01:38:41.322 --> 01:38:44.603]  And I want to show clips of that during Joe Biggs' piece on this.
[01:38:46.081 --> 01:38:48.583]  On the military conditioning operations.
[01:38:48.583 --> 01:38:50.804]  Where Texas is listed as hostile.
[01:38:50.804 --> 01:38:52.185]  One of only a few states in the U.S.
[01:38:52.185 --> 01:38:53.927]  And we'll show the other ones that they're listing.
[01:38:53.927 --> 01:38:56.048]  That's why they got to run this PSYOP.
[01:38:56.048 --> 01:38:59.691]  And yeah, we're hostile to having our five-year-olds taught how to be trannies.
[01:38:59.691 --> 01:39:03.373]  And we're hostile to having our borders wide open, having to pay for it all.
[01:39:03.373 --> 01:39:04.574]  We're hostile to turning our guns in.
[01:39:04.574 --> 01:39:06.275]  We're hostile to having our farms taken.
[01:39:06.275 --> 01:39:08.897]  We're hostile to being treated like slaves.
[01:39:08.897 --> 01:39:12.860]  And you notice it's Texas, not perfect, but Texas, the spirit of Texas.
[01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:15.442]  Texas is doing more fighting than all the other states combined right now.
[01:39:17.406 --> 01:39:21.529]  And Ron Paul comes out of Texas, I'm here, you just notice the spirit's here.
[01:39:21.529 --> 01:39:23.791]  The Lone Star State's here and we're not ever giving up.
[01:39:23.791 --> 01:39:28.014]  And so you can bring all your Navy SEALs and all your Delta Force here you want.
[01:39:28.014 --> 01:39:31.056]  You think they're going to buy the shy-op and fight the American people?
[01:39:31.056 --> 01:39:32.538]  Oh, I know, I know.
[01:39:32.538 --> 01:39:35.280]  You'll use Delta Force units and we know they're involved in dirty work.
[01:39:36.482 --> 01:39:37.542]  To stage the false flags.
[01:39:37.542 --> 01:39:39.323]  You really think that's going to float?
[01:39:39.323 --> 01:39:40.143]  You really think?
[01:39:40.143 --> 01:39:45.964]  The Navy SEALs refused to do a false flag for Dick Cheney in 2007.
[01:39:45.964 --> 01:39:48.865]  That was put out by Cy Hirsch in New Yorker Magazine.
[01:39:48.865 --> 01:39:55.127]  Do you think, if they wouldn't do a false flag to blame the Iranians, do you think they're not going to leak it all to us?
[01:39:55.127 --> 01:40:00.888]  I was having dinner with William Binney, the former head director of operations for the National Security Agency last night, for two hours.
[01:40:02.193 --> 01:40:12.938]  And he was telling me how when the feds tried to create fake documents and he was leaking secret data that the Justice Department leaked to him how they'd faked it by people inside risking their lives.
[01:40:12.938 --> 01:40:19.282]  The more you squeeze, the more we're going to wake up and resist.
[01:40:19.282 --> 01:40:24.804]  Go ahead, blow up a truck and say I did it.
[01:40:24.804 --> 01:40:27.966]  Everybody knows it's not true.
[01:40:27.966 --> 01:40:29.167]  And I'm done with you people.
[01:40:29.167 --> 01:40:30.427]  You want to play chicken?
[01:40:30.427 --> 01:40:31.328]  You want to go head on?
[01:40:31.328 --> 01:40:31.848]  Let's do it.
[01:40:33.439 --> 01:40:36.741]  It'll be just like the Alamo all over again.
[01:40:36.741 --> 01:40:40.003]  Strike us down, we become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[01:40:40.003 --> 01:40:43.865]  Any other Star Wars analogy you want?
[01:40:43.865 --> 01:40:46.387]  You just don't mind control everybody, Globulus.
[01:40:46.387 --> 01:40:49.989]  You got that?
[01:40:49.989 --> 01:40:54.772]  You want to make things so ugly that the average person gets scared deep down and turns inside and gives up.
[01:40:54.772 --> 01:40:56.273]  Well, we're not giving up.
[01:40:57.130 --> 01:41:00.731]  And the thing about the Spirit of Liberty is it's infectious scum.
[01:41:00.731 --> 01:41:01.812]  Let's go back to the articles.
[01:41:01.812 --> 01:41:04.913]  Now, here's the one I want to get to.
[01:41:04.913 --> 01:41:08.675]  As they sign us on to 2 point... It's now 2 point plus quadrillion.
[01:41:08.675 --> 01:41:09.695]  It's over.
[01:41:09.695 --> 01:41:10.555]  It was 1.5 six years ago.
[01:41:10.555 --> 01:41:12.236]  Now it's... Then it was 2, the Wall Street Journal.
[01:41:12.236 --> 01:41:14.697]  Now it's 2.3, they're saying, or higher.
[01:41:14.697 --> 01:41:16.037]  Quadril.
[01:41:16.037 --> 01:41:21.860]  That's two thousand three hundred trillion dollars
[01:41:22.895 --> 01:41:33.382]  That's, depending on the numbers, 20, 30, 40 times more than all the wealth in the world that these bankers created as a black hole to shine all of us onto that we don't owe.
[01:41:33.382 --> 01:41:36.184]  Why would anyone want to do this to prosperity?
[01:41:36.184 --> 01:41:38.086]  Why would anyone want to screw everything over?
[01:41:38.086 --> 01:41:45.651]  Why would anyone want to feed kids McDonald's food that on record sterilizes rats and then put images of dead babies out front?
[01:41:45.651 --> 01:41:46.972]  It's a freak show, man!
[01:41:46.972 --> 01:41:49.294]  And I'm not a freak!
[01:41:52.779 --> 01:41:56.663]  The Pentagon has Texas listed as its enemy.
[01:41:56.663 --> 01:42:01.467]  And I want to add to Joe's report, Forbes and others about Pentagon trains to take on the Tea Party.
[01:42:01.467 --> 01:42:03.749]  This is it, folks.
[01:42:03.749 --> 01:42:16.981]  I don't know if it'll be next month or five years from now, but I'm telling you, they're going to detonate a nuke in a major city and blame it on patriots and have HD video of patriots taking responsibility for it.
[01:42:16.981 --> 01:42:18.343]  HD video is phony.
[01:42:19.938 --> 01:42:22.380]  As all the rest of the phony CG stuff you see.
[01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:24.101]  John Wayne's back doing commercials.
[01:42:24.101 --> 01:42:27.524]  No folks, John Wayne died 30-something years ago.
[01:42:27.524 --> 01:42:28.985]  Elvis is back making commercials.
[01:42:28.985 --> 01:42:31.227]  No man, he's dead!
[01:42:31.227 --> 01:42:33.688]  You understand that?
[01:42:33.688 --> 01:42:38.292]  Mad Dog Ben Richards didn't butcher the women in Bakersfield.
[01:42:38.292 --> 01:42:40.894]  It ain't real, you got it?
[01:42:40.894 --> 01:42:42.395]  Now let's go over this.
[01:42:42.395 --> 01:42:47.339]  Ten charts which show we are much worse off than just before the last economic crisis.
[01:42:48.872 --> 01:42:50.373]  Articles on Infowars.com.
[01:42:50.373 --> 01:42:55.014]  If you believe that ignorance is bliss, you might not want to read this article.
[01:42:55.014 --> 01:42:57.835]  And then it goes into all of it.
[01:42:57.835 --> 01:42:58.855]  The national debt.
[01:42:58.855 --> 01:43:02.737]  And here we have, from the federal government, the numbers.
[01:43:02.737 --> 01:43:02.837]  U.S.
[01:43:02.837 --> 01:43:04.797]  Department of the Treasury.
[01:43:04.797 --> 01:43:06.758]  Or FREDS, the website.
[01:43:06.758 --> 01:43:11.460]  And we see from 1970 to now, an exponential growth curve.
[01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:12.260]  In the national debt.
[01:43:14.428 --> 01:43:16.190]  When Obama came in, it was $9 trillion.
[01:43:16.190 --> 01:43:18.312]  Now it's almost $19 trillion.
[01:43:18.312 --> 01:43:19.113]  Let's look at number two.
[01:43:19.113 --> 01:43:20.334]  Total debt.
[01:43:20.334 --> 01:43:21.415]  Not just national debt.
[01:43:21.415 --> 01:43:23.658]  Let's look at that graph.
[01:43:23.658 --> 01:43:30.625]  Exponential, hyperbolic numbers on that front.
[01:43:30.625 --> 01:43:33.488]  $60 trillion in global debt.
[01:43:33.488 --> 01:43:35.691]  Not counting derivatives, $2.3 quadrillion.
[01:43:37.571 --> 01:43:38.812]  You did hear me say 2.3 quadrille.
[01:43:38.812 --> 01:43:47.380]  It's hard to say 2.3 quadrille, but it is harder to even say 2,000 trillion, 2,300 trillion.
[01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:49.262]  Only in the New World Order.
[01:43:49.262 --> 01:43:56.528]  Only in America do you have Planet Fitness with guys in pink outfits saying don't grunt, with alarms on the walls when you grunt and they run over and yell at you.
[01:43:56.528 --> 01:43:57.429]  I mean, what?
[01:43:57.429 --> 01:44:00.492]  And Starbucks saying don't, you know, oh, you're white, you're evil.
[01:44:00.492 --> 01:44:02.293]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:44:02.293 --> 01:44:03.755]  Number three, the velocity of money.
[01:44:04.625 --> 01:44:09.207]  When an economy is healthy, money tends to change hands and circulate through the system quite rapidly.
[01:44:09.207 --> 01:44:12.528]  So it makes sense that the velocity of money fell dramatically during the last recession.
[01:44:12.528 --> 01:44:14.509]  But why has it kept going down since?
[01:44:14.509 --> 01:44:19.951]  Because they're giving themselves free money at the high level to buy everything up while cutting it off to us.
[01:44:19.951 --> 01:44:22.312]  The hyper-stag rape inflation, the term I coined.
[01:44:23.626 --> 01:44:25.307]  The homeowner rate.
[01:44:25.307 --> 01:44:29.628]  Oh, as they did the plan of the Democrats to have a chicken in every pot, a house in every pot.
[01:44:29.628 --> 01:44:35.030]  Homeownership has plunged since 2000 to an absolute record low.
[01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:37.350]  Look at that graph right there.
[01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:38.471]  Massive plunge.
[01:44:38.471 --> 01:44:39.191]  Isn't it loving?
[01:44:40.251 --> 01:44:44.515]  Number five, the employment rate, all time low.
[01:44:44.515 --> 01:44:53.322]  It did a dead count bounce under Obamacare in the last two years because tens of millions of people had to get a second or third job and that was counted as another person employed.
[01:44:53.322 --> 01:44:55.924]  But there's that graph right there.
[01:44:55.924 --> 01:44:58.386]  Number six, the labor force participation rate.
[01:44:59.452 --> 01:45:00.413]  Oh, look at that plunging.
[01:45:00.413 --> 01:45:02.475]  100 plus million people on welfare.
[01:45:02.475 --> 01:45:03.716]  Hundreds of millions not worried.
[01:45:03.716 --> 01:45:04.917]  Just a total joke.
[01:45:04.917 --> 01:45:06.017]  More illegals pouring in.
[01:45:06.017 --> 01:45:07.519]  Faster than you can shake a stick at it.
[01:45:07.519 --> 01:45:08.299]  Number seven.
[01:45:08.299 --> 01:45:11.642]  The inactivity rate for men in their private working years.
[01:45:11.642 --> 01:45:14.664]  Absolutely exploding right there.
[01:45:14.664 --> 01:45:16.266]  Real median household income.
[01:45:16.266 --> 01:45:17.587]  Let's look at that.
[01:45:17.587 --> 01:45:20.409]  Plunging massively since 2000.
[01:45:20.409 --> 01:45:22.070]  From the FedZone website.
[01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:23.632]  Oh, here we go.
[01:45:23.632 --> 01:45:25.053]  Let's look at the number nine now.
[01:45:25.053 --> 01:45:25.913]  Not trying to be negative here.
[01:45:25.913 --> 01:45:27.094]  Just telling you the fact.
[01:45:27.094 --> 01:45:27.615]  Inflation.
[01:45:29.062 --> 01:45:32.105]  Up, despite the factors of depression in the real economy.
[01:45:32.105 --> 01:45:39.410]  And number 10, government dependence absolutely skyrocketing in the last 30 years to ultra-massive levels.
[01:45:39.410 --> 01:45:41.112]  Is this an economic recovery?
[01:45:41.112 --> 01:45:41.552]  Well, yes.
[01:45:41.552 --> 01:45:42.753]  2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:45:42.753 --> 01:45:44.334]  Raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit.
[01:45:44.334 --> 01:45:45.976]  If you have a business, you didn't build that.
[01:45:45.976 --> 01:45:51.860]  And dead babies with pus dripping out of their eyeballs and skulls and satanic symbols outside McDonald's in Austin.
[01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:53.121]  Everything's wonderful!
[01:45:53.121 --> 01:45:54.482]  Everything is awesome!
[01:45:54.482 --> 01:45:56.384]  And see, Alex Jones is the crazy man.
[01:45:59.462 --> 01:46:02.744]  Because I met with the Houston... I'm not going to get into that.
[01:46:02.744 --> 01:46:06.206]  I met with the San Antonio Police Chief, the Kingsville Police, all of them.
[01:46:06.206 --> 01:46:08.647]  I made films about it.
[01:46:08.647 --> 01:46:14.751]  I met with the former Director of Operations of the National Security Agency last night.
[01:46:14.751 --> 01:46:18.493]  But long before I met with those people, I was told all of this.
[01:46:20.282 --> 01:46:30.024]  All of this by military veterans and people who'd worked in the CIA and retired FBI agents and current federal marshals when I was like 17, 18 years old.
[01:46:30.024 --> 01:46:36.605]  I was told this stuff by FBI agents and people when I was 10 years old in Dallas, Texas.
[01:46:36.605 --> 01:46:37.945]  All of it.
[01:46:37.945 --> 01:46:43.246]  And American patriots have held this back this long and now it doesn't matter.
[01:46:43.246 --> 01:46:45.807]  The globalists are just going to push it through no matter what.
[01:46:49.974 --> 01:46:50.957]  Alright, I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:46:50.957 --> 01:46:54.688]  I appreciate Rick and Max and John and Pete and Julie and everybody holding.
[01:46:54.688 --> 01:46:55.931]  I just want to say, because I keep forgetting...
[01:46:57.441 --> 01:46:58.101]  People complain.
[01:46:58.101 --> 01:46:59.902]  They say, why are you doing 10% off now?
[01:46:59.902 --> 01:47:00.942]  We don't get paid till Friday.
[01:47:00.942 --> 01:47:01.902]  I want to get some XQ.
[01:47:01.902 --> 01:47:06.504]  I want to get 30% off, plus 10% off on DNA Force.
[01:47:06.504 --> 01:47:07.704]  I mean, that's an incredible discount.
[01:47:07.704 --> 01:47:10.005]  15% off all water filters.
[01:47:10.005 --> 01:47:10.445]  Everything.
[01:47:10.445 --> 01:47:14.966]  Books, T-shirts, Made in America, 1776, all of it.
[01:47:14.966 --> 01:47:23.609]  Silver Bullet, Lung Cleanse, all of it is 10% off promo code SUPER at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:47:23.609 --> 01:47:24.409]  Promo code SUPER.
[01:47:25.247 --> 01:47:29.130]  We're going to keep the water filtration thing going until Sunday, and then it's over, okay?
[01:47:29.130 --> 01:47:29.751]  That's it.
[01:47:29.751 --> 01:47:31.332]  Sunday night.
[01:47:31.332 --> 01:47:33.434]  You got two days, basically, two damn days.
[01:47:33.434 --> 01:47:36.216]  You can get 50% off the promo code WATER.
[01:47:36.216 --> 01:47:46.324]  But 10% off, even if stuff already has a discount, 10% off InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:47:46.324 --> 01:47:47.665]  Thank you for funding us.
[01:47:47.665 --> 01:47:52.950]  Our promise is to bring you the best, highest quality products we can, and made in America when we can, like the Made in 1776 line.
[01:47:54.551 --> 01:47:59.837]  And to just bring you what we use, what we've tested, what we believe is the best at the lowest price possible.
[01:47:59.837 --> 01:48:04.203]  Infowarslife.com, shortwave radios, infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:48:08.676 --> 01:48:13.479]  We will get more quality reporters and more writers and more crew, and we will continue.
[01:48:13.479 --> 01:48:16.261]  We will stay at the same level if the funds come in like this.
[01:48:16.261 --> 01:48:22.005]  If more comes in, we will rampage forward with the spirit of the Lord, firing on all our cylinders against the enemy.
[01:48:22.005 --> 01:48:29.829]  You've got our 110% dedication to gung-ho, never stopping this fight against these demonic forces we're fighting.
[01:48:29.829 --> 01:48:36.734]  You've got 110% commitment on us, and all I ask is you pray for us, spread the word about the broadcast, and if you've got money,
[01:48:36.974 --> 01:48:40.275]  I want to get high-quality products that have been life-changing for myself and others.
[01:48:40.275 --> 01:48:42.856]  You don't want to drink glyphosates and fluoride, get the filters.
[01:48:42.856 --> 01:48:45.657]  You don't want to, you want to block those suckers in your body, get the X2.
[01:48:45.657 --> 01:48:48.318]  You want to flush your guts out, get the oxy powder.
[01:48:48.318 --> 01:48:50.159]  I mean, just try these products, man.
[01:48:50.159 --> 01:48:51.419]  I wouldn't push something!
[01:48:51.419 --> 01:48:52.860]  I 100% believe it!
[01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:54.641]  I am 10%!
[01:48:54.641 --> 01:48:55.521]  You understand that?
[01:48:55.521 --> 01:49:00.323]  And we are facing pure evil here, and that's why I get so upset, because I got to deal with these people every day.
[01:49:00.323 --> 01:49:02.103]  I got to deal with reality every day.
[01:49:02.103 --> 01:49:03.804]  I got to deal with knowing what's coming here.
[01:49:06.744 --> 01:49:07.926]  A world without humans!
[01:49:07.926 --> 01:49:09.348]  A world of abortion!
[01:49:09.348 --> 01:49:10.890]  A world of scum!
[01:49:10.890 --> 01:49:15.136]  Alright, let's go to Rick in Illinois.
[01:49:15.136 --> 01:49:15.937]  You're on the air, Rick.
[01:49:15.937 --> 01:49:17.980]  Go ahead.
[01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:18.841]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[01:49:18.841 --> 01:49:19.522]  Good, buddy.
[01:49:19.522 --> 01:49:19.883]  Welcome.
[01:49:21.065 --> 01:49:23.007]  Hey, first of all, I want to thank you for everything that you do.
[01:49:23.007 --> 01:49:27.731]  You were an inspiration to me a few years ago when I created my website, ConspiracyNews.com.
[01:49:27.731 --> 01:49:28.031]  Awesome!
[01:49:28.031 --> 01:49:30.293]  Beautiful news site name.
[01:49:30.293 --> 01:49:30.833]  Go ahead, brother.
[01:49:30.833 --> 01:49:43.064]  You and I were actually featured together in an article on US News and Time.com online a couple years back with the Hurricane Sandy and the Engineer Storm of the Century.
[01:49:43.064 --> 01:49:45.286]  Well, they admit they can engineer them, and a lot of experts said that.
[01:49:46.334 --> 01:49:46.534]  Right.
[01:49:46.534 --> 01:49:48.616]  Well, I wanted to talk to you about a couple things today, actually.
[01:49:48.616 --> 01:50:09.054]  I was going to get into the gun control thing with the ammunition, but in light of this new article that you just revealed from the Special Forces Command, I want to bring you back to July 22nd of 2012, where the, and this is from the Associated Press, the Marine Corps creates the first global law enforcement battalions.
[01:50:09.054 --> 01:50:09.234]  Yes.
[01:50:11.163 --> 01:50:18.786]  And then there was an article put out, let's see here, July 25, 2012, full spectrum operations in the Homeland Division of the Future.
[01:50:18.786 --> 01:50:19.906]  The Department of Defense came out.
[01:50:19.906 --> 01:50:21.127]  That's right, it's all been announced.
[01:50:21.127 --> 01:50:25.088]  It's just that now they have Texas listed as a hostile enemy.
[01:50:25.088 --> 01:50:28.569]  The Feds list Texas as the enemy.
[01:50:28.569 --> 01:50:31.130]  And prepare a full invasion force training drill.
[01:50:31.130 --> 01:50:32.931]  My God, the treason's getting insane.
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:46.863]  April 12th of 2013, there was a Federal Register, Volume 78, Number 71, where the DOD came out, Department of Defense, Office of the Secretary, 32 CFR Part 182, and it was entitled... Rick, stay there.
[01:50:46.863 --> 01:50:48.043]  I love a caller like this.
[01:50:48.043 --> 01:50:55.745]  He's just listing all the real official documents where they're trying to take our guns and put us in forced labor camps while they say the military is their main enemy.
[01:50:55.745 --> 01:50:58.146]  When they're done with the military, they're going to put them in there with us.
[01:50:58.146 --> 01:50:59.486]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:51:00.171 --> 01:51:03.153]  This hour brought to you by InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[01:51:15.021 --> 01:51:17.342]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[01:51:17.342 --> 01:51:22.045]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?

[01:51:24.126 --> 01:51:24.307]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:51:30.530 --> 01:51:31.511]  Hey, Boomer!
[01:51:31.511 --> 01:51:34.953]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[01:51:34.953 --> 01:51:36.634]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[01:51:36.634 --> 01:51:38.575]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[01:51:38.575 --> 01:51:44.418]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[01:51:44.418 --> 01:51:45.258]  I know, right?
[01:51:45.258 --> 01:51:46.579]  You love it too!
[01:51:46.579 --> 01:51:48.020]  Yeah, I'm thirsty too.
[01:51:48.020 --> 01:51:49.040]  Let's go get some!
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:50.781]  Get Berkey Clean Water by calling 877-886-3653.
[01:51:50.781 --> 01:51:51.001]  That's 877-886-3653.
[01:51:51.001 --> 01:51:51.622]  Or visit GoBerkey.com.
[01:51:59.406 --> 01:52:03.034]  Why use dial-up when you can use broadband?
[01:52:03.034 --> 01:52:04.036]  Why travel with this?
[01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:06.950]  When you can use this.
[01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:12.934]  And why would anyone use colloidal or ionic silver when you can use supernatural silver?
[01:52:12.934 --> 01:52:20.199]  Supernatural silver is state-of-the-art and it's been clinically proven to be several hundred times more effective than those other silvers.
[01:52:20.199 --> 01:52:26.143]  It's powerful enough to protect you and your family from the threat of deadly viruses, bacteria and fungus.
[01:52:26.143 --> 01:52:29.385]  But it's so safe that it can be used internally or topically.
[01:52:29.445 --> 01:52:29.985]  I think so.
[01:52:59.457 --> 01:53:03.923]  Healthy elimination is essential to high energy, a cheerful mood, and prevention of disease.
[01:53:03.923 --> 01:53:08.789]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[01:53:08.789 --> 01:53:12.834]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease.
[01:53:12.834 --> 01:53:16.259]  And a clean and well-moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[01:53:16.499 --> 01:53:19.141]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[01:53:19.141 --> 01:53:23.623]  I've taken whey protein products for years, and I've never noticed results I have with your product.
[01:53:23.623 --> 01:53:26.805]  I've suffered with thoughts of constipation most of my life.
[01:53:26.805 --> 01:53:31.127]  Within a few days of taking One World Whey, I noticed a dramatic change.
[01:53:31.127 --> 01:53:35.030]  Also in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:38.612]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar, and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[01:53:38.612 --> 01:53:42.554]  But I've noticed in the past week or so, I'm not feeling bad anymore, and the foot pain is gone.
[01:53:42.734 --> 01:53:47.096]  I'm just finishing up a five pound tuff I ordered and just got off the phone ordering more.
[01:53:47.096 --> 01:53:48.076]  I love your product.
[01:53:48.076 --> 01:53:48.517]  Thank you.
[01:53:48.517 --> 01:53:48.817]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:53:48.817 --> 01:53:49.137]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:53:49.137 --> 01:53:49.857]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[01:53:49.857 --> 01:53:50.678]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[01:54:04.458 --> 01:54:05.738]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[01:54:05.738 --> 01:54:06.319]  to 2 p.m.
[01:54:06.319 --> 01:54:07.099]  Central.
[01:54:07.099 --> 01:54:10.220]  You know, I'm sorry, and I'm not really sorry, but I am sorry in a way.
[01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:24.164]  I get upset when I'm looking at official Pentagon documents that are on their website, where they say we're preparing to acclimate the public, and it's a PSYOP, it actually says that, and it shows Texas is hostile, and there's three other states listed as enemies.
[01:54:24.164 --> 01:54:25.564]  And of course, it's all patriot states.
[01:54:27.247 --> 01:54:27.627]  Thank you.
[01:54:47.819 --> 01:54:53.721]  My God, how are they going to, how do you think they're going to try to trigger this, Rick, from ConspiracyNews.com, right?
[01:54:53.721 --> 01:54:54.541]  That's your site.
[01:54:54.541 --> 01:55:00.382]  How do you think that they would trigger it with a false flag, an economic collapse, but they've got to demonize the patriots.
[01:55:00.382 --> 01:55:01.903]  That's what they trained to fight.
[01:55:01.903 --> 01:55:04.364]  That's woken the military up, though.
[01:55:04.364 --> 01:55:11.946]  How does the establishment think the military's actually, A, going to do something traitorous, but B, go up against American gun owners if 1% fight back?
[01:55:13.206 --> 01:55:22.188]  You're talking about something like 101.5 million serious combatants, most of them veterans, and they know the veterans are going to fight back.
[01:55:22.188 --> 01:55:23.968]  That's why they're being tracked and listed.
[01:55:23.968 --> 01:55:27.509]  They're trying to deny the veterans health care to get them off the rolls, kill them.
[01:55:27.509 --> 01:55:28.729]  I don't see this floating.
[01:55:28.729 --> 01:55:32.850]  I don't see this dog hunting, Rick, unless they totally want to destroy the U.S.
[01:55:32.850 --> 01:55:39.711]  by the Civil War, and that's the plan, which it actually is, with George Soros funding, rioting against the police.
[01:55:39.711 --> 01:55:40.431]  What do you say, Rick?
[01:55:42.222 --> 01:55:45.607]  Uh, first of all, it's just conspiracy news with the Z.com.
[01:55:45.607 --> 01:55:47.690]  And, uh, yeah, I don't know how they're going to do it, honestly.
[01:55:47.690 --> 01:55:53.057]  I mean, there's, we're being bombarded every day by multiple crises and every day it's something different.
[01:55:53.057 --> 01:55:57.684]  You could look at a false flag nuke with Russia or the stars with Russia to preoccupy the
[01:55:58.284 --> 01:56:05.025]  The population, you've got the racial tensions in Ferguson and other places, you've got the police killings, and the citizens going up against the police.
[01:56:05.025 --> 01:56:07.306]  There's a mini-war starting on the streets now with that.
[01:56:07.306 --> 01:56:11.166]  I can remember back to December 5th, 2012.
[01:56:11.166 --> 01:56:14.867]  Actually, I'm sorry, it was August 10th, 2012.
[01:56:14.867 --> 01:56:18.788]  You had a guest, she's a friend of mine on Facebook, Susan Pozol.
[01:56:18.788 --> 01:56:20.648]  Her Pozol, Suzanne Pozol.
[01:56:20.648 --> 01:56:26.409]  She wrote an article, you guys post on your website, US Army Tactical Manual Describes How to Control Domestic Insurrection.
[01:56:27.182 --> 01:56:27.683]  Absolutely.
[01:56:27.683 --> 01:56:29.865]  We've covered that for many years.
[01:56:29.865 --> 01:56:32.567]  And if you go over these different reports, I appreciate your call.
[01:56:32.567 --> 01:56:34.449]  Good to hear from you.
[01:56:34.449 --> 01:56:39.454]  You understand that they're moving forward with this plan.
[01:56:39.454 --> 01:56:48.262]  And when you look at the military involved domestically, again, they're planning to target the Liberty Movement in this country.
[01:56:48.262 --> 01:56:51.025]  They'll only get away with that by pulling off some false flag.
[01:56:53.436 --> 01:57:00.798]  And if you look at how the communists took over in 1917, it took them two or three years to take over the whole country and Russia, all they seized was Moscow.
[01:57:00.798 --> 01:57:06.040]  Then they got the military to come turn themselves into them and they killed tens of thousands of the officers.
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:10.221]  And they ordered the public to turn in their guns, people that were able to own weapons.
[01:57:10.221 --> 01:57:17.544]  So, it's a gamble, but they could take the country over if the military follows the orders.
[01:57:19.113 --> 01:57:20.874]  It's a very frightening prospect.
[01:57:20.874 --> 01:57:23.055]  Let's go to John in Texas.
[01:57:23.055 --> 01:57:23.936]  John, you're on the air.
[01:57:23.936 --> 01:57:25.917]  Welcome.
[01:57:25.917 --> 01:57:27.198]  Hi, Alex.
[01:57:27.198 --> 01:57:42.286]  You know, if Vladimir Putin was truly a nationalist, a Christian, and he was truly against the New World Order, he'd release all the Soviet-era secret police documents about our POWs from World War II in Korea that disappeared into the blue logs and our government didn't lift a finger to help them out.
[01:57:42.915 --> 01:57:50.037]  About what really happened to Larry McDonald, about the murder of Patton, about what really happened on 9-1-1.
[01:57:50.037 --> 01:57:50.697]  I agree.
[01:57:50.697 --> 01:57:53.258]  That whole cabal of abortion is right out of the water.
[01:57:53.258 --> 01:57:58.519]  I agree, Vladimir Putin is just another criminal syndicate.
[01:57:58.519 --> 01:58:03.180]  I don't think, until he does this, I can't believe that, that he's truly a Christian, he's changing Russia.
[01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:05.841]  If he don't do that, then he's just part of the whole game plan.
[01:58:07.284 --> 01:58:12.448]  Well, I mean, there's the Chinese crime bloc, the Russian crime bloc, and the Anglo-American crime bloc.
[01:58:12.448 --> 01:58:16.411]  They're all battling over Latin America, Africa, and areas of Asia and the Middle East.
[01:58:16.411 --> 01:58:24.937]  The globalist crime bloc is a transhumanist eugenicist group who is clearly the most virulent and has got their act together the best and is the main threat.
[01:58:24.937 --> 01:58:25.698]  Might as well be the Borg.
[01:58:27.319 --> 01:58:30.181]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:30.181 --> 01:58:31.181]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.018 --> 01:58:59.684]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:58:59.684 --> 01:59:09.609]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:59:09.609 --> 01:59:12.531]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:59:12.671 --> 01:59:12.811]  I think?
[01:59:35.307 --> 01:59:40.651]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[01:59:40.651 --> 01:59:46.656]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with OxyPowder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:59:46.656 --> 01:59:48.157]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:06.092 --> 02:00:07.393]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.393 --> 02:00:09.155]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.155 --> 02:00:10.917]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.917 --> 02:00:12.519]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.519 --> 02:00:14.060]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.060 --> 02:00:18.244]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.244 --> 02:00:22.569]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.569 --> 02:00:26.233]  It's so fantastical, so bizarre, so over the top.
[02:00:28.126 --> 02:00:47.837]  But so actually common historically, but it feels fantastic, it feels epic, to see a scientific incremental takeover of society, waging war against decency, against values, against security, against family, against God, against private property, against goodness.
[02:00:51.169 --> 02:01:00.817]  But that's what's going on, and I just don't see how the globalists think they're going to get away with this civil war they're trying to set up.
[02:01:00.817 --> 02:01:05.020]  Got false flag written all over it to demonize the opposition.
[02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:06.922]  Max in California, you're on the air.
[02:01:06.922 --> 02:01:07.342]  Go ahead.
[02:01:07.342 --> 02:01:10.105]  Then we'll go to Julie and others.
[02:01:10.105 --> 02:01:10.945]  Hello, Alex.
[02:01:10.945 --> 02:01:12.567]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:12.567 --> 02:01:13.527]  I'm on the air.
[02:01:13.527 --> 02:01:14.248]  All right, great.
[02:01:14.248 --> 02:01:15.009]  You sure are.
[02:01:15.009 --> 02:01:16.670]  Welcome.
[02:01:16.670 --> 02:01:17.751]  Yes, I am.
[02:01:17.751 --> 02:01:18.872]  Two words.
[02:01:18.872 --> 02:01:20.133]  Get bombed.
[02:01:21.121 --> 02:01:24.924]  It is defined in Barron's financial and investment terms.
[02:01:24.924 --> 02:01:27.006]  It's been there since the 60s.
[02:01:27.006 --> 02:01:28.588]  It's not a mistake.
[02:01:28.588 --> 02:01:38.216]  It's an architectural demolition term in the financial world, and it's being perpetrated completely on purpose.
[02:01:39.059 --> 02:01:41.699]  Yeah, it's how the globalists control the third world.
[02:01:41.699 --> 02:01:46.000]  They get them into debt systems that are basically impossible to pay back.
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:49.201]  And because we were so wealthy, they signed us on to derivatives that aren't even ours.
[02:01:49.201 --> 02:01:52.781]  But when we sign on to, quote, prop up the banks, it now becomes our debt.
[02:01:52.781 --> 02:01:55.862]  And that is the debt bomb to bring us down.
[02:01:55.862 --> 02:01:56.582]  Right.
[02:01:56.582 --> 02:02:05.144]  If I didn't know what to say, it is fighting for the clause that signed us on to that quadrillion that you keep mentioning.
[02:02:05.144 --> 02:02:07.524]  How come nobody's, how come that's not front page every day?
[02:02:08.874 --> 02:02:15.816]  Because it's not front page that the border is wide open and that they're training the military to confiscate our firearms during total collapse.
[02:02:15.816 --> 02:02:17.256]  But it's all going on.
[02:02:17.256 --> 02:02:24.438]  It's not front page news that all ten charts from the federal government's own website show the economy in free fall.
[02:02:24.438 --> 02:02:26.199]  So what do you think is going to happen first?
[02:02:26.199 --> 02:02:29.680]  The financial attacker or buyer or...
[02:02:30.775 --> 02:02:34.618]  And I'm glad to deal with this aggravation.
[02:02:34.618 --> 02:02:37.080]  Well, you notice, I mean, it's good to be aggravated.
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:37.981]  That's normal.
[02:02:37.981 --> 02:02:40.783]  Because aggravation is so you figure out a solution.
[02:02:40.783 --> 02:02:42.004]  We know their plan.
[02:02:42.004 --> 02:02:43.626]  Their number one enemy is preppers.
[02:02:43.626 --> 02:02:44.867]  They say that in veterans.
[02:02:44.867 --> 02:02:47.369]  It's anybody that can stand up for themselves is self-sufficient.
[02:02:47.369 --> 02:02:54.615]  They want to collapse to make you sign on, to get a national ID card, to go through their systems, to live in a government warehouse, basically.
[02:02:54.615 --> 02:02:57.777]  A major re-education of society.
[02:02:58.835 --> 02:03:08.121]  Under a collapse, and they're worried about holdouts, like in Katrina that were high and dry, that have their own power and their own guns, that's who's going to be targeted.
[02:03:08.121 --> 02:03:11.343]  And then everybody's targeted after that, so it's a very diabolical plan.
[02:03:11.343 --> 02:03:13.164]  Max, good to hear from you, great point.
[02:03:13.164 --> 02:03:15.086]  Julie in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:03:17.014 --> 02:03:19.237]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:03:19.237 --> 02:03:20.800]  Thank you.
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:28.051]  I'm calling to alert Texas residents about a sinister piece of legislation that's pending in the U.S., or not U.S., in the Texas Senate.
[02:03:28.051 --> 02:03:30.674]  What, the one to ban people shooting video at police?
[02:03:32.623 --> 02:03:47.092]  It's the one that would give the state broad police powers to force anyone suspected of being exposed or being a carrier of an infectious disease to detainment and treatment including vaccination without their consent.
[02:03:47.092 --> 02:03:49.313]  It gives the governor and the Department of Health
[02:03:49.833 --> 02:03:55.458]  That's right, I read about that draconian bill that of course won't be applied to the illegals, so it's all fake.
[02:03:55.458 --> 02:03:56.599]  What's the bill number?
[02:03:56.599 --> 02:03:56.619]  538. 538.
[02:04:12.313 --> 02:04:27.939]  It would be great if everybody in Texas would call their legislator and the nine members of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee that have sponsored this bill and are preparing to get it out of committee because this is, like, set for abuse right here.
[02:04:28.953 --> 02:04:35.575]  Well, of course, and they leave the borders wide open, and then bring in the Ebola patients, but then say in Texas, we'll forcibly inoculate whoever we want.
[02:04:35.575 --> 02:04:39.216]  They use the crisis they helped create to bring in the tyranny.
[02:04:39.216 --> 02:04:45.477]  Absolutely, and there's the bill, SB 538, the 2015-2016 84th Legislative Session.
[02:04:45.477 --> 02:04:46.638]  Thank you so much, Julie.
[02:04:46.638 --> 02:04:47.198]  Great job.
[02:04:47.198 --> 02:04:52.899]  We need to get on this, and we will cover this more, because it's another forced inoculation bill.
[02:04:52.899 --> 02:04:54.880]  That's exactly what that is.
[02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:55.500]  Stay with us.
[02:04:55.500 --> 02:04:58.221]  We'll be right back to talk about medical tyranny and more.
[02:04:59.898 --> 02:05:00.819]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[02:05:00.819 --> 02:05:01.399]  Good, brother.
[02:05:01.399 --> 02:05:03.121]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:05:03.121 --> 02:05:05.063]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:05:05.063 --> 02:05:09.087]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:05:09.087 --> 02:05:11.709]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:05:11.709 --> 02:05:14.151]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:05:14.151 --> 02:05:22.119]  Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:05:22.319 --> 02:05:25.543]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[02:05:25.543 --> 02:05:27.085]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:05:27.085 --> 02:05:30.128]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:05:30.128 --> 02:05:31.770]  Saving a ton of money there.
[02:05:31.770 --> 02:05:37.156]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[02:05:37.176 --> 02:05:37.996]  We're good to go.
[02:05:59.713 --> 02:06:03.215]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:06:03.215 --> 02:06:11.460]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:16.884]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:06:59.372 --> 02:07:08.355]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[02:07:08.355 --> 02:07:18.898]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[02:07:18.898 --> 02:07:24.960]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:31.724]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:07:31.724 --> 02:07:34.786]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[02:07:34.786 --> 02:07:40.330]  And adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[02:07:40.330 --> 02:07:43.412]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:07:43.412 --> 02:07:44.933]  No needles, no injections.
[02:07:44.933 --> 02:07:46.334]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:07:46.334 --> 02:07:47.535]  Try it for yourself.
[02:07:47.535 --> 02:07:48.856]  Discover the secret.
[02:07:48.856 --> 02:07:49.957]  Secret 12.
[02:07:49.957 --> 02:07:52.298]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[02:07:55.181 --> 02:07:56.045]  Or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:18.496 --> 02:08:20.177]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:08:20.177 --> 02:08:21.838]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:21.838 --> 02:08:29.904]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:29.904 --> 02:08:35.908]  We just talked to a caller about a forced inoculation bill in Texas legislature that's moving out of committee.
[02:08:35.908 --> 02:08:38.229]  We've seen two of these bills around the nation shot down.
[02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:43.573]  The point is they're going for them while leaving the borders wide open and bringing Ebola patients into the country.
[02:08:44.738 --> 02:08:50.122]  We have tuberculosis infecting 27 at Kansas City Area High School, but nobody cares about that.
[02:08:50.122 --> 02:08:56.406]  They'd rather freak out about stuff that doesn't kill you, like the measles, and say, oh, the unvaccinated are causing it.
[02:08:56.406 --> 02:09:06.213]  There's an excellent film that we've been selling for several years at Infowarsstore.com, one of hundreds of great films we have listed there, titled Doctored.
[02:09:06.213 --> 02:09:09.076]  The film, the American Medical Association says, I want you to see.
[02:09:09.076 --> 02:09:13.439]  The Los Angeles Times said, an involving, well-crafted, humane,
[02:09:14.608 --> 02:09:17.491]  Look at the topic that stands to affect us all.
[02:09:17.491 --> 02:09:30.524]  If you want to expose what big pharma is and what big medicine is, not even so much the doctors but the system, and Obamacare and all of it and where that's going, you need to see this film.
[02:09:30.524 --> 02:09:35.069]  Your food, your medicine, your health care has all been doctored.
[02:09:35.069 --> 02:09:36.270]  A Jeff Hayes film.
[02:09:37.253 --> 02:09:38.995]  And Jeff Hayes joins us.
[02:09:38.995 --> 02:09:40.957]  Your calls are coming up after the break.
[02:09:40.957 --> 02:09:46.243]  He'll be with us about 40 minutes, then we'll take calls and hit some final news.
[02:09:46.243 --> 02:09:48.185]  Your back pain will require surgery.
[02:09:48.185 --> 02:09:50.347]  Without these pills, you face long pain.
[02:09:50.347 --> 02:09:52.409]  Your child's behavior requires medication.
[02:09:52.409 --> 02:09:53.270]  These are the questions.
[02:09:53.270 --> 02:09:57.495]  This gives any parent or any person the answers they need to counter the fraud.
[02:09:57.975 --> 02:10:04.618]  So even though our listeners are more informed than the average person, more informed than I am on many subjects, this is a film you need to donate to the library.
[02:10:04.618 --> 02:10:08.320]  This is a film you need to show your PTA, your church.
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:15.763]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com, so your purchase supports the filmmaker, this radio, TV broadcast, and you getting the intel you need.
[02:10:15.763 --> 02:10:21.306]  But we're not here to push this all day on people, but here's an example of what we're getting at when the film gets set.
[02:10:21.306 --> 02:10:26.088]  Extremely professionally produced, he's an award-winning filmmaker, been in the short list for an Academy Award.
[02:10:27.702 --> 02:10:34.907]  Breastfeeding pays babies who nursed earned more as adults, study says, L.A.
[02:10:34.907 --> 02:10:36.208]  Times, 39% more.
[02:10:36.208 --> 02:10:42.072]  It's funny because the brains on average of children that breastfeed are way more, about 30% more.
[02:10:42.072 --> 02:10:44.994]  So you earn more and your brain's bigger.
[02:10:44.994 --> 02:10:48.176]  Wow, it actually fills up your skull cavity.
[02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:53.411]  And if you look at what's in the average formula, it's high fructose corn syrup.
[02:10:53.411 --> 02:10:54.912]  It's full of toxins.
[02:10:54.912 --> 02:10:56.512]  In fact, pull up the Washington Post headline.
[02:10:56.512 --> 02:10:59.434]  90% is the headline.
[02:10:59.434 --> 02:11:02.675]  Another headline is half.
[02:11:02.675 --> 02:11:07.517]  Just type in corn syrup mercury or corn syrup lead.
[02:11:07.517 --> 02:11:11.518]  See, it's what they're, the fertilizer, the corn, they use toxic fertilizer.
[02:11:11.518 --> 02:11:13.679]  It's insane, people.
[02:11:13.679 --> 02:11:15.060]  Then this is a larger program.
[02:11:16.130 --> 02:11:19.171]  But this article says it pays to breastfeed for babies when they grow up.
[02:11:19.171 --> 02:11:24.393]  The steady diet of breast milk may boost their monthly income 39% according to a new report.
[02:11:24.393 --> 02:11:28.974]  Researchers tracked down 3,500 Brazilian adults who enrolled in the study.
[02:11:28.974 --> 02:11:37.937]  On the days of their birth, 1982 back to the 80s, interviewers had asked the mothers how long their children were breastfed and how long they were when they were introduced to their foods.
[02:11:37.937 --> 02:11:39.318]  And it just goes through the fact that
[02:11:39.898 --> 02:11:45.601]  They were much higher IQs, and it goes into many studies have found a correlation between breastfeeding and IQs.
[02:11:45.601 --> 02:11:47.102]  Yeah, and brain size.
[02:11:47.102 --> 02:11:48.082]  And intelligence tests.
[02:11:48.082 --> 02:11:50.303]  And it goes through a bunch of other studies here in the U.S.
[02:11:50.303 --> 02:11:51.284]  and other countries.
[02:11:51.284 --> 02:11:58.187]  So, I've always talked about this, and we've had mainstream establishment liberal publications make fun of me.
[02:11:58.187 --> 02:12:00.788]  Jones is bashing women who don't breastfeed.
[02:12:00.788 --> 02:12:02.709]  Yeah, I kinda am.
[02:12:02.709 --> 02:12:06.611]  I mean, I don't want to be flippant here, but you might as well just abort the baby.
[02:12:06.611 --> 02:12:07.692]  You're already aborting the brain.
[02:12:08.883 --> 02:12:12.825]  I don't mean really go abort your baby, but I mean it's pretty close.
[02:12:12.825 --> 02:12:14.826]  And if you weren't breastfed, I'm not knocking you.
[02:12:14.826 --> 02:12:18.668]  But if you're already smart, man, you'd have been up there in lights, your IQ.
[02:12:18.668 --> 02:12:23.190]  Let me give you a newsflash.
[02:12:23.190 --> 02:12:33.176]  Women have breasts and the entire mammal species, whether it's a blue whale, or a elephant, or a gazelle, or a beaver, or a woman.
[02:12:34.702 --> 02:12:36.483]  The milk is for the baby.
[02:12:36.483 --> 02:12:46.368]  I know nowadays they say that milk comes from the school lunch program and the only mama that gives milk is our great mother goddess Michelle Obama, the great, great Kali.
[02:12:46.368 --> 02:12:48.289]  But it is.
[02:12:48.289 --> 02:12:53.832]  And I know that sounds wild to folks that have been told 2 plus 2 equals 5 and raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit and all that.
[02:12:53.832 --> 02:12:55.633]  I'm not being sarcastic here.
[02:12:55.633 --> 02:12:59.055]  One day it will be a conspiracy that women ever had milk or they ever had babies.
[02:12:59.055 --> 02:13:01.196]  Half the babies are cesarean now because they make more money.
[02:13:02.537 --> 02:13:08.260]  And the doctor can run off to what they're doing, so we need to put pressure on this, like we've done the GMO crowd and everybody else to change it.
[02:13:08.260 --> 02:13:15.943]  The film is doctored, and he's made a lot of other great films as well, and we're going to have him back for a full hour in the near future, and on the nightly news as well.
[02:13:15.943 --> 02:13:20.885]  But Jeff Hayes, thank you so much, jeffhayesfilms.com, for coming on with us.
[02:13:20.885 --> 02:13:29.569]  I kind of just introed with some of my current examples of that, and the FDA wants to stop listing drug interactions on the vaccines.
[02:13:30.289 --> 02:13:33.954]  I mean, this really is crazy what's going on.
[02:13:33.954 --> 02:13:38.961]  Tell us about your film and what drove you to make it and some of the things covered in the film.
[02:13:38.961 --> 02:13:42.126]  Well, the film that you're talking about, they're doctored.
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:47.963]  It really started in that film.
[02:13:47.963 --> 02:13:50.545]  You know, we talk briefly about vaccines.
[02:13:50.545 --> 02:13:53.647]  We talk briefly about GMOs.
[02:13:53.647 --> 02:14:01.873]  But prior to doing that film and meeting the people that we interviewed there, I had no clue that there would be any reason not to be vaccinated.
[02:14:01.873 --> 02:14:07.917]  I had no clue that GMOs were a risk to us.
[02:14:07.917 --> 02:14:12.700]  And so those two subjects, you know, as the film doctor, we really talk about
[02:14:13.420 --> 02:14:28.721]  Alternative medicine and how traditional medicine has attacked it and kept it down and really zeroing in on a case of chiropractors where in 1962 the AMA formed a committee to
[02:14:30.971 --> 02:14:34.433]  Literally to dismantle the chiropractic profession.
[02:14:34.433 --> 02:14:44.837]  And so all through the 60s, you had these chiropractors, these wonderful people that kept running into obstacle after obstacle and they felt like they were conspiracy theorists.
[02:14:44.837 --> 02:14:47.358]  It's like, man, it seems like there's something against us.
[02:14:47.358 --> 02:14:49.339]  Finally, in 1974, five chiropractors sued the AMA.
[02:14:52.220 --> 02:14:58.404]  And the documents that came out in the course of that case, it took 13 years, but they were vindicated.
[02:14:58.404 --> 02:14:59.084]  They were right.
[02:14:59.084 --> 02:15:06.608]  The AMA was underhandedly, surreptitiously trying to dismantle the profession.
[02:15:06.608 --> 02:15:12.432]  In 1987, the AMA was found guilty of conspiring to contain and eliminate the chiropractic profession.
[02:15:13.052 --> 02:15:18.658]  So that really is just a microcosm of what's happened to all alternative therapy.
[02:15:18.658 --> 02:15:23.163]  Anybody who doesn't really sell drugs.
[02:15:23.163 --> 02:15:32.272]  As we did that film, the subjects that we ran into about vaccines and GMOs, these were new topics to me.
[02:15:32.272 --> 02:15:32.373]  And
[02:15:33.574 --> 02:15:35.515]  They were radioactive.
[02:15:35.515 --> 02:15:40.378]  We had people, even in the chiropractic profession, they were like, you can't cover that in this film.
[02:15:40.378 --> 02:15:45.982]  And so we followed that with the film, Bought, which... We're going to have you back about Bought.
[02:15:45.982 --> 02:15:48.163]  We're going to start carrying that as well.
[02:15:48.163 --> 02:15:49.724]  And we'll talk about Bought right now.
[02:15:49.724 --> 02:15:52.947]  But expanding on that, I never went to a chiropractor.
[02:15:54.102 --> 02:16:01.567]  Until I'd thrown my shoulder out about 10 years ago and, well the police had done it, arresting me.
[02:16:01.567 --> 02:16:02.828]  So they said I had to have surgery.
[02:16:02.828 --> 02:16:06.430]  I went to a chiropractor, popped it right back in, never had another problem.
[02:16:06.430 --> 02:16:08.471]  Then I was firing a .50 cal last year.
[02:16:09.617 --> 02:16:11.578]  Handheld about a hundred rounds.
[02:16:11.578 --> 02:16:12.879]  Thought it was fine.
[02:16:12.879 --> 02:16:16.481]  My spine completely bent towards the left.
[02:16:16.481 --> 02:16:17.622]  I went to the medical doctor.
[02:16:17.622 --> 02:16:18.583]  They said surgery.
[02:16:18.583 --> 02:16:19.483]  Went to a chiropractor.
[02:16:19.483 --> 02:16:20.144]  Three sessions.
[02:16:20.144 --> 02:16:20.864]  Totally fixed it.
[02:16:20.864 --> 02:16:21.945]  Did the x-rays.
[02:16:21.945 --> 02:16:23.166]  Everything was fine.
[02:16:23.166 --> 02:16:25.447]  All I know is I got results.
[02:16:25.447 --> 02:16:27.929]  But if they had their way, I would have had to have the surgery.
[02:16:27.929 --> 02:16:28.209]  Go ahead.
[02:16:28.209 --> 02:16:28.409]  Sorry.
[02:16:29.572 --> 02:16:31.913]  This is what's astounding.
[02:16:31.913 --> 02:16:42.515]  If you go see a surgeon for a back problem, you're 42 times more likely to have back surgery than if you go to a chiropractor.
[02:16:42.515 --> 02:16:52.457]  When you figure over half of all back surgeries fail, the number one cause of a second back surgery is a first back surgery.
[02:16:52.457 --> 02:16:54.058]  This is horrific.
[02:16:54.058 --> 02:16:58.699]  Finally, insurance companies are starting to stand up for this saying, we can't do this.
[02:16:59.119 --> 02:17:00.660]  We can't keep paying people.
[02:17:00.660 --> 02:17:20.066]  We're creating a nation of drug addicts because of the pain that they endure after having back surgery and so many times this can be fixed quickly and simply by a chiropractor and yet surgery is considered conservative care and going to see a chiropractor is considered radical.
[02:17:20.066 --> 02:17:23.988]  It blows my mind how we do this.
[02:17:23.988 --> 02:17:24.808]  Keep breaking it down!
[02:17:26.439 --> 02:17:27.182]  What do you mean?
[02:17:27.182 --> 02:17:30.174]  I mean, getting into your experiences of the film.
[02:17:31.044 --> 02:17:35.127]  So I'll give you a perfect example.
[02:17:35.127 --> 02:17:39.029]  There's a chiropractor in Dallas, Texas named Francis Murphy.
[02:17:39.029 --> 02:17:47.715]  So Francis discovered an adjustment that is really my closest thing to a miracle that I've ever seen.
[02:17:47.715 --> 02:17:50.998]  He's done it and filmed it 1,500 times.
[02:17:50.998 --> 02:17:54.000]  People have frozen shoulder.
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:59.643]  It's a very common ailment where literally they can't lift their arm up higher than this.
[02:18:00.672 --> 02:18:04.516]  And so there's a drug that's recently been approved for frozen shoulder.
[02:18:04.516 --> 02:18:07.319]  There's surgery that they do for frozen shoulder.
[02:18:07.319 --> 02:18:21.054]  Francis came up with an adjustment of the occiput, but where your brain meets your skull, that when he does this adjustment, suddenly people that couldn't raise their arm before can now raise their arm over their head.
[02:18:21.534 --> 02:18:25.678]  And he never touches the shoulder, which is what's so bizarre about it.
[02:18:25.678 --> 02:18:37.590]  It almost validates the entire chiropractic model in that, you know, doing an adjustment to someone's neck or occiput suddenly affects their shoulder without them ever touching the shoulder.
[02:18:38.231 --> 02:18:42.173]  He's done this and filmed it successfully over 1500 times.
[02:18:42.173 --> 02:18:43.993]  So we filmed him and doctored.
[02:18:43.993 --> 02:18:48.455]  I felt horrible for the way he calls me and says, Hey, I've got a guy with a frozen shoulder.
[02:18:48.455 --> 02:18:52.177]  And I'm like, Francis, I'm sorry, I can't get there for a month.
[02:18:52.177 --> 02:18:57.819]  And so we made this poor guy with a frozen shoulder, keep his frozen shoulder for another month.
[02:18:57.819 --> 02:19:03.241]  So he could wait for us to film him and and getting that released.
[02:19:03.241 --> 02:19:05.122]  But what's gone on since then?
[02:19:06.280 --> 02:19:07.301]  Yes.
[02:19:07.301 --> 02:19:14.105]  He noticed lots of different health outcomes to the people that were suffering from this that once he did this adjustment.
[02:19:14.105 --> 02:19:16.887]  So he started measuring heart rate variability.
[02:19:16.887 --> 02:19:21.410]  He started measuring all these different aspects of it.
[02:19:21.410 --> 02:19:28.855]  We brought him here to the University of Utah and had him sit with a professor at the University of Utah Medical School.
[02:19:28.855 --> 02:19:32.578]  And they started looking for what could be the mechanism.
[02:19:32.578 --> 02:19:34.399]  We know this works.
[02:19:34.399 --> 02:19:35.880]  And why does it work?
[02:19:36.580 --> 02:19:41.025]  So, Francis was thinking, well, I'm adjusting in this area here.
[02:19:41.025 --> 02:19:44.368]  We think it's the cranial nerve 11.
[02:19:44.368 --> 02:19:50.073]  The vagus nerve actually shares that same conduit through that part of our anatomy.
[02:19:50.073 --> 02:19:53.777]  And the vagus nerve controls your breathing, your parasympathetic system.
[02:19:53.777 --> 02:19:58.021]  So, all of a sudden, this is why he was seeing so many behavioral changes.
[02:19:59.173 --> 02:20:05.837]  My sister is a professor and has been a professor at a medical school for over 25 years.
[02:20:05.837 --> 02:20:11.159]  I brought her in and she's looking and now they're doing research on this.
[02:20:11.159 --> 02:20:20.084]  Just finding out why this simple chiropractic addressment is having such a profound effect on autism, on MS, on all these other things.
[02:20:20.084 --> 02:20:21.345]  Sure, well I didn't have that.
[02:20:21.345 --> 02:20:25.367]  I had a pinched nerve and they were telling me that it was a torn rotator cuff.
[02:20:25.367 --> 02:20:26.968]  All I know is I went to the chiropractor
[02:20:27.808 --> 02:20:31.590]  And it was hurting so bad, I'd gone up to an event in Dallas, and I just couldn't do it anymore.
[02:20:31.590 --> 02:20:34.992]  So I just pulled over at a place, went in, they said, yeah, come back in two hours.
[02:20:34.992 --> 02:20:36.153]  They did it.
[02:20:36.153 --> 02:20:37.634]  It hurt real bad when it happened.
[02:20:37.634 --> 02:20:40.156]  I felt like electricity in my arm for about a day, and then it was gone.
[02:20:40.156 --> 02:20:43.458]  So whatever the chiropractor did fixed it, and then they just fixed me again.
[02:20:44.398 --> 02:20:45.858]  I mean, I ought to be kissing their feet.
[02:20:45.858 --> 02:20:49.859]  I'm not saying there aren't some quacks out there and that it's not, you know, a panacea.
[02:20:49.859 --> 02:20:53.020]  All I know is it's worked really well, and that makes sense.
[02:20:53.020 --> 02:20:59.161]  You've got nerves coming out of your brain, in the hole in the bottom of it, in your skull, and they go down through your spine.
[02:20:59.161 --> 02:21:01.342]  If they get pinched, you're going to have problems.
[02:21:01.342 --> 02:21:07.943]  And if a chiropractor can pop it and get it where it's not being squeezed anymore, I mean, I'm not a rocket scientist, but that sounds like it's pretty simple.
[02:21:10.067 --> 02:21:16.992]  If you think about it, if we just start with the belief, let's do the most conservative thing first.
[02:21:16.992 --> 02:21:19.835]  It stuns me when I talk to people, the guy who
[02:21:20.689 --> 02:21:29.915]  The guy who built the house that I live in is 33 years old, has had three back surgeries, and is addicted to painkillers.
[02:21:29.915 --> 02:21:33.457]  And he did all that before he ever went to see a chiropractor.
[02:21:33.457 --> 02:21:39.501]  Good grief, before you do something radical like this, go see a chiropractor and see if they can help you.
[02:21:39.501 --> 02:21:40.622]  Go see several of them.
[02:21:42.071 --> 02:21:43.452]  Well, that's right.
[02:21:43.452 --> 02:21:48.874]  I have a friend who plays tennis, and she had gotten to the point where she never stopped playing tennis.
[02:21:48.874 --> 02:21:52.915]  She plays it competitively in leagues, and is one of the best people in the city.
[02:21:52.915 --> 02:21:55.976]  And she was going to have to stop, and she'd been to medical doctors, she'd been everywhere.
[02:21:55.976 --> 02:22:00.118]  And I said, listen, go to this chiropractor and get Graston with a steel bar.
[02:22:00.658 --> 02:22:03.580]  And I said, because it got my neck pain out.
[02:22:03.580 --> 02:22:09.905]  I've started going to the chiropractor now because I had neck pain, and it hurts like hell when they're doing it, but it knocked it out.
[02:22:09.905 --> 02:22:13.427]  She did about six, seven sessions, it's gone.
[02:22:13.427 --> 02:22:19.071]  Yeah, there's a basic philosophy of chiropractic, and they talk about innate.
[02:22:19.071 --> 02:22:27.937]  And basically, you know, if you take a baby and you slice its arm, that baby, its body already knows how to heal itself.
[02:22:27.937 --> 02:22:29.719]  We innately know how to heal.
[02:22:30.399 --> 02:22:44.309]  And so, if we can remove interference, if we can have the nutrients in our body that we need and are not taking in toxins that affect us, our body can heal itself over and over.
[02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:57.218]  This respect for the body is unfortunately absent in traditional medicine in most cases, where we look at it and we say, okay, somebody's genetically broken, that somebody needs a medical intervention.
[02:22:57.278 --> 02:23:00.501]  Well of course you're genetically broken if you smoke two packs of cigarettes.
[02:23:00.501 --> 02:23:03.845]  You have a pre-distribution, what's the word?
[02:23:03.845 --> 02:23:07.929]  Pre-disposition, I have trouble with that word, to get lung cancer with your genetics.
[02:23:07.929 --> 02:23:11.452]  But it's because you were smoking cigarettes, not because you have bad genetics.
[02:23:11.452 --> 02:23:13.114]  Why are all these diseases going up?
[02:23:13.114 --> 02:23:20.661]  It's because of toxins in the environment, lack of exercise, GMO, vaccines, not because suddenly our genes are horrible.
[02:23:21.602 --> 02:23:30.026]  Yeah, this is where, and we're going to see this more and more over the next decade, that the science is epigenetics, not genetics.
[02:23:30.026 --> 02:23:35.449]  It is your genes in the environment that we put them in, not your genes.
[02:23:35.449 --> 02:23:36.029]  Absolutely.
[02:23:36.029 --> 02:23:38.250]  Well, they've always known it's nature and nurture.
[02:23:38.250 --> 02:23:41.152]  Now they're trying to say it's just, just nature.
[02:23:42.023 --> 02:23:44.167]  And, I mean, that's not true even in mainline science.
[02:23:44.167 --> 02:23:51.360]  They're just lying to people and saying, you will get cancer early because you have the genes for it and these women are going and having their breasts removed.
[02:23:53.102 --> 02:24:06.112]  This is such a profound disrespect for our body and for the miracle, the trillions of things that are happening in our body every day.
[02:24:06.112 --> 02:24:12.777]  And for us to just have the hubris to go, oh no, no, you have depression, that must be a deficiency of Prozac somehow.
[02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:16.482]  Doctors available at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:24:16.482 --> 02:24:18.543]  Everything's 10% off today, right through the weekend.
[02:24:18.543 --> 02:24:20.384]  I've decided to extend it.
[02:24:20.384 --> 02:24:25.888]  And I've not seen bought yet, but I'm told it's very powerful and gets into the vaccines, the GMO, and the rest of it.
[02:24:25.888 --> 02:24:28.610]  And of course, we know that the research is bought now.
[02:24:28.610 --> 02:24:31.452]  We know they're trying to shut things down as people turn against it.
[02:24:31.452 --> 02:24:32.973]  I see we're at a tipping point.
[02:24:32.973 --> 02:24:33.893]  A, do you agree with that?
[02:24:33.893 --> 02:24:36.475]  B, let's break down what's in your other film, bought.
[02:24:37.481 --> 02:24:46.309]  So the reason for the title bought, I am a free enterprise nut.
[02:24:46.309 --> 02:24:52.014]  I believe that that's the solution for most of our economic problems and a lot of our social problems.
[02:24:52.014 --> 02:24:53.255]  I bet you like Ron Paul, that's horrible.
[02:24:54.075 --> 02:25:12.753]  Yes, so what's been so discouraging to me, as I watch what happens when you mix money and health care, and I was talking to a friend about it, I'm like, this is almost a betrayal of capitalism, and he points out, this is not capitalism, this is phony capitalism.
[02:25:12.753 --> 02:25:17.357]  And we really have been sold out.
[02:25:17.357 --> 02:25:18.719]  Well, phony is the phony.
[02:25:19.639 --> 02:25:35.664]  It not only destroys your culture, centralizes power with corrupt people that operate in gangs, but then it discredits capitalism, and then they advertise socialism as the way to get rid of it, but then you just get socialized, independent, and the globalists are above it as cronies, and now have you domesticated.
[02:25:36.905 --> 02:25:40.067]  Exactly, exactly what's happening.
[02:25:40.067 --> 02:25:43.469]  In the film, Bought, we show some whistleblowers.
[02:25:43.469 --> 02:25:52.635]  I had to drive out into the woods in Pennsylvania where this whistleblower literally ruined his life for 10 years.
[02:25:52.635 --> 02:26:03.581]  He was an investigator for the state of Pennsylvania and he went after the head of the pharmaceutical board in the state.
[02:26:04.662 --> 02:26:16.034]  And there, as he got into it, he found out, and that was a picture of him right there, he found out that it was the big pharmaceutical companies behind it and his boss told him to back off.
[02:26:16.034 --> 02:26:18.157]  They give to both sides of the aisle.
[02:26:18.157 --> 02:26:19.738]  We're not going after those guys.
[02:26:20.439 --> 02:26:23.502]  And so he continued to work the case.
[02:26:23.502 --> 02:26:30.849]  Finally, 10 years later, Johnson & Johnson pled guilty to the lies they told about the drug Risperdal.
[02:26:30.849 --> 02:26:32.330]  We're talking about deaths.
[02:26:32.330 --> 02:26:35.213]  They pled guilty to criminal charges.
[02:26:35.213 --> 02:26:40.158]  They paid now close to $3 billion in fines.
[02:26:40.158 --> 02:26:41.459]  But meanwhile, they made $33 billion.
[02:26:43.106 --> 02:26:52.530]  We have the GlaxoSmithKline whistleblower that, once again, they made $44 billion and they paid a $3 billion fine.
[02:26:52.530 --> 02:26:55.311]  It's just the cost of doing business.
[02:26:55.311 --> 02:27:04.195]  And meanwhile, you know, these people who risk their very lives and livelihood to try to bring, you know, they're one in a million.
[02:27:04.195 --> 02:27:05.456]  It's happening every day.
[02:27:06.431 --> 02:27:09.532]  Folks can get your film at JeffHaysFilms.com or Amazon.
[02:27:09.532 --> 02:27:10.512]  We're going to be carrying it.
[02:27:10.512 --> 02:27:11.692]  I was like, why haven't I seen this?
[02:27:11.692 --> 02:27:12.633]  Why aren't we carrying it?
[02:27:12.633 --> 02:27:15.313]  I'm told it's even more powerful than doctored.
[02:27:15.313 --> 02:27:21.175]  And I think every chiropractor in the country should be selling your film to folks that come in.
[02:27:21.175 --> 02:27:24.216]  Everybody has to weaponize against the globalists and the info war.
[02:27:24.696 --> 02:27:31.358]  We're under attack, we have a right to defense, we all become our own media operations in one way or another or we lose everything.
[02:27:31.358 --> 02:27:37.279]  The First Amendment, the Second, the Fourth, the Tenth, the Ninth, medical freedom is under attack.
[02:27:37.279 --> 02:27:42.441]  The system knows there's an awakening happening, so they're trying to put the clamps down right now.
[02:27:42.441 --> 02:27:43.941]  That's clearly what's happening.
[02:27:43.941 --> 02:27:46.102]  Do you agree with that and can you speak to the awakening?
[02:27:46.744 --> 02:27:52.389]  Well this is such, I'm telling you, it's people like you, we really do have to do this.
[02:27:52.389 --> 02:27:56.814]  I took out a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal for bought three weeks ago.
[02:27:56.814 --> 02:27:57.754]  That's right.
[02:27:57.754 --> 02:28:04.881]  The next day there was a story saying you need to get your kids vaccinated that was almost the size of my full page ad.
[02:28:04.881 --> 02:28:05.342]  Of course.
[02:28:05.942 --> 02:28:19.085]  Ten days in a row, in the Wall Street Journal, articles about this measles epidemic, you need to get your kids vaccinated, talking about the problem of people not getting vaccinated, over and over and over.
[02:28:19.085 --> 02:28:20.585]  And I thought about it.
[02:28:20.585 --> 02:28:25.667]  I passed billboards here in Utah saying, you know, get your kids vaccinated.
[02:28:25.667 --> 02:28:26.427]  It's a war!
[02:28:26.427 --> 02:28:27.167]  It's a full push!
[02:28:27.967 --> 02:28:31.809]  And meanwhile, I took out one ad one time.
[02:28:31.809 --> 02:28:33.490]  That's all I could afford to do.
[02:28:33.490 --> 02:28:37.313]  You know, a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal cost a fortune.
[02:28:37.313 --> 02:28:43.536]  There's no way for any of us to make a difference in fighting with them down that road.
[02:28:43.536 --> 02:28:46.098]  It really is exactly what you said.
[02:28:46.098 --> 02:28:49.960]  We all have to support to create our own media operation.
[02:28:49.960 --> 02:28:56.204]  We all have to be in darkness is no match for light if there's light.
[02:28:56.844 --> 02:29:16.067]  That's right, and again, if somebody just shows their friends and family doctored, or if somebody just tells folks about Infowars.com and sends a free link to a podcast or a video that they think is important of our great reporters, or if somebody starts their own blog and writes their own articles and goes down and takes photos and covers things, we'll have people everywhere.
[02:29:16.067 --> 02:29:20.208]  If you know a neighbor that got brain damage from vaccines, go interview them, put it on YouTube.
[02:29:20.208 --> 02:29:21.228]  All of you are leaders.
[02:29:21.228 --> 02:29:23.369]  Don't thank Jeff, don't thank me.
[02:29:23.369 --> 02:29:25.549]  We're trying to survive and help our families and help you.
[02:29:26.289 --> 02:29:28.370]  I mean, that's what empathy's all about.
[02:29:28.370 --> 02:29:31.252]  You've got empathy not because you're a nice guy, but because it's there.
[02:29:31.252 --> 02:29:33.693]  You get what happens to somebody else could happen to you.
[02:29:33.693 --> 02:29:44.158]  We're all one, and we've all got to become leaders, and this evil, parasitic, anti-free market, corporate mafia will fall.
[02:29:44.158 --> 02:29:45.779]  Just as sure as day follows night.
[02:29:45.779 --> 02:29:46.279]  Stay with us.
[02:29:46.279 --> 02:29:49.141]  Final segment with Jeff.
[02:29:49.141 --> 02:29:50.541]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.541 --> 02:29:53.082]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.082 --> 02:29:55.764]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.191 --> 02:30:01.451]  Another major health threat.
[02:30:01.451 --> 02:30:06.433]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:30:06.433 --> 02:30:09.114]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:30:09.114 --> 02:30:16.136]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:30:16.136 --> 02:30:19.157]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:30:19.157 --> 02:30:22.158]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:30:22.158 --> 02:30:24.098]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:30:24.098 --> 02:30:26.959]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:30:27.039 --> 02:30:32.761]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:30:32.761 --> 02:30:36.263]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:30:36.263 --> 02:30:39.344]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:31:06.223 --> 02:31:12.872]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation, a highly advanced nutraceutical form.
[02:31:13.172 --> 02:31:18.756]  Of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.

[02:31:39.111 --> 02:31:45.739]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:31:45.739 --> 02:31:50.884]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[02:31:50.884 --> 02:31:54.609]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.

[02:31:59.864 --> 02:32:03.527]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:32:03.527 --> 02:32:07.810]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:32:07.810 --> 02:32:09.591]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:32:09.591 --> 02:32:14.915]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[02:32:14.915 --> 02:32:17.456]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.

[02:32:29.369 --> 02:32:32.892]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[02:32:41.138 --> 02:32:46.542]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:33:43.021 --> 02:33:44.383]  Jeff Hays is our guest.
[02:33:44.383 --> 02:33:49.188]  Kudos to DrudgeReport.com, always leading breaking news.
[02:33:49.188 --> 02:33:52.471]  Link, top right hand corner, DrudgeReport.com.
[02:33:52.471 --> 02:34:02.042]  We'll put it on screen right now, an article that just went live minutes ago at Infowars.com.
[02:34:02.042 --> 02:34:03.523]  We have a story right there.
[02:34:03.523 --> 02:34:03.824]  Troops.
[02:34:05.788 --> 02:34:09.691]  Move off bases and if you go ahead and click on it.
[02:34:09.691 --> 02:34:11.753]  Feds preparing to invade Texas.
[02:34:11.753 --> 02:34:19.239]  Some participants will be wearing civilian attire and driving civilian vehicles and they list Texas.
[02:34:19.239 --> 02:34:21.021]  I want to put another sub-headline.
[02:34:21.021 --> 02:34:23.002]  Feds prepare to invade Texas.
[02:34:23.002 --> 02:34:24.964]  List state as hostile.
[02:34:24.964 --> 02:34:26.085]  It says in the document.
[02:34:26.085 --> 02:34:27.286]  I want to get a document cam shot.
[02:34:27.286 --> 02:34:28.147]  You guys did this really quick.
[02:34:28.147 --> 02:34:28.787]  Great job.
[02:34:28.787 --> 02:34:30.288]  We just covered this one hour ago.
[02:34:30.288 --> 02:34:31.489]  One hour ago and it's already on Drudge.
[02:34:32.310 --> 02:34:33.550]  It's a great job getting it up quick.
[02:34:33.550 --> 02:34:40.592]  Just adding their screenshots of the document of Texas in red, showing that Texas is seen as hostile.
[02:34:40.592 --> 02:34:42.353]  I mean, people are not going to believe this.
[02:34:42.353 --> 02:34:51.656]  Just like six years ago, we got the secret MIAC report from state police in Missouri, then another document from state police in California, and people didn't believe it.
[02:34:51.656 --> 02:34:58.778]  And then federal marshals, well, a federal marshal gave us another one, the master document that was copied at the state level.
[02:34:59.258 --> 02:35:07.724]  Change for the state, saying that veterans, gun owners, Ron Paul, Aaron Russo, people like that, are basically terrorists.
[02:35:07.724 --> 02:35:12.447]  And then a week later, Ron Paul came out and the Fed said, no, that's all real and he shouldn't have restricted documents.
[02:35:13.772 --> 02:35:16.914]  In fact, I had the FBI get a little upset with me.
[02:35:16.914 --> 02:35:19.936]  I said, go ahead, make up whatever you're going to make up, you know.
[02:35:19.936 --> 02:35:21.977]  I don't care it says, you know, restricted.
[02:35:21.977 --> 02:35:27.240]  You know, you guys are really doing some nasty stuff and, you know, do you really want to say the veterans are the terrorists?
[02:35:27.240 --> 02:35:28.841]  I mean, come on.
[02:35:28.841 --> 02:35:30.622]  So, that's on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:35:30.622 --> 02:35:39.427]  So, that article, that blurbs up, let's add to it, you know, because I know it was written quickly, screenshots of the document, because a lot of folks won't actually click on the document.
[02:35:40.327 --> 02:35:43.129]  And there's video there of Biggs and I going through the document.
[02:35:43.129 --> 02:35:47.693]  So thank you, Matt Drudge, True American Media at DrudgeReport.com.
[02:35:47.693 --> 02:35:51.195]  True Muckraker, DrudgeReport.com.
[02:35:51.195 --> 02:35:53.657]  And we'll go through that document as we talk to Jeff Hayes.
[02:35:53.657 --> 02:36:00.863]  Jeff, just separately, the maker of Doctored that we sell at InfowarsStore.com and the other film I haven't seen yet, Doctors, is so professional.
[02:36:00.863 --> 02:36:04.565]  I mean, no wonder you've been on the short list for Academy Awards.
[02:36:04.565 --> 02:36:06.026]  I'd love to work with you sometime on a film.
[02:36:08.448 --> 02:36:13.293]  Your film bought, really, from the trailers and things I've seen looks hardcore.
[02:36:13.293 --> 02:36:19.659]  But just hearing about the military training to basically domestically take over, what do you think they're getting ready for?
[02:36:19.659 --> 02:36:20.820]  Financial collapse?
[02:36:20.820 --> 02:36:25.044]  And why on earth would they list Texas as, quote, hostile?
[02:36:25.865 --> 02:36:51.994]  That's astounding to me and again this is where what I look at and like I've been living for the last year and a half in a world of vaccines and GMOs without really lifting my head up and as I was in New Jersey last week for a screening and on Monday of this week there were 400 mostly moms that went down to the New Jersey Senate
[02:36:52.774 --> 02:36:56.055]  And had their voice heard.
[02:36:56.055 --> 02:37:05.999]  And then the New Jersey, you know, the committee that is looking at the bill for to get rid of any personal belief exemption in New Jersey.
[02:37:05.999 --> 02:37:06.900]  They listened to them.
[02:37:06.900 --> 02:37:08.660]  Then they met and ignored them.
[02:37:08.660 --> 02:37:12.942]  And, of course, sent the bill straight to the full Senate.
[02:37:13.951 --> 02:37:21.493]  I'm telling you, there is something happening here, a concerted effort that I would not have believed if I wasn't seeing it with my own eyes.
[02:37:21.493 --> 02:37:22.154]  That's right.
[02:37:22.154 --> 02:37:23.274]  The tyrants are moving.
[02:37:23.274 --> 02:37:24.334]  The power grab is on.
[02:37:24.334 --> 02:37:26.975]  It's like a gold rush of tyranny.
[02:37:26.975 --> 02:37:34.417]  And they're going to have local citizens involved in the PSYOP, the document says, to prepare the public to work with the military.
[02:37:34.417 --> 02:37:35.958]  I mean, what are they getting ready for?
[02:37:36.969 --> 02:37:37.369]  I don't know.
[02:37:53.775 --> 02:37:59.798]  This is when programs like yours become profoundly important.
[02:37:59.798 --> 02:38:07.222]  I don't know that they can... I've never seen a more professional effort as I watch all the news stories that happen.
[02:38:07.222 --> 02:38:11.183]  There's definitely... I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
[02:38:11.183 --> 02:38:17.987]  Thank goodness that we have access to each other to be able to... Absolutely, and Jeff, it's...
[02:38:19.130 --> 02:38:21.696]  I want your reason, your take on why they're pushing so hard.
[02:38:21.696 --> 02:38:22.778]  I mean, I think I know why.
[02:38:22.778 --> 02:38:28.470]  In fact, I'm certain that part of it is this, but I want you to augment it or add to it or disagree with it, whatever you think.
[02:38:29.693 --> 02:38:33.054]  McDonald's is multi-years imploding.
[02:38:33.054 --> 02:38:35.995]  I mean, they're basically closing all over the place in the U.S.
[02:38:35.995 --> 02:38:36.936]  and other western areas.
[02:38:36.936 --> 02:38:40.497]  They're expanding and unfortunately dumbed down third world areas.
[02:38:40.497 --> 02:38:49.981]  But every other major globalist operation is taking GMO out of their ice cream or bovine growth hormone out or glyphosate or fluoride.
[02:38:50.581 --> 02:38:50.761]  I think?
[02:39:12.225 --> 02:39:18.632]  And so, on so many fronts, people are waking up, and so the Empire is striking back.
[02:39:18.632 --> 02:39:23.257]  We've blown up the Death Star, but hey, it doesn't matter, they're still coming with their Star Destroyers.
[02:39:23.257 --> 02:39:27.561]  So folks need to know, we're in the battle, we're having victories, but the war ain't over, people.
[02:39:27.561 --> 02:39:28.222]  They're coming.
[02:39:28.222 --> 02:39:30.825]  I mean, they are dropping the hammer.
[02:39:30.825 --> 02:39:31.506]  What do you say, Jeff?
[02:39:32.106 --> 02:39:33.808]  You're exactly right.
[02:39:33.808 --> 02:39:42.717]  There's too much money at stake when you look at the astounding amount of money and the control that they've had.
[02:39:42.717 --> 02:39:47.562]  But again, the power in this culture and everybody
[02:39:48.243 --> 02:39:48.683]  I think?
[02:40:07.455 --> 02:40:18.179]  Where the media didn't cover at all the fact that the CDC whistleblower who said, yes, we lied about, we hid evidence about autism and vaccines.
[02:40:18.179 --> 02:40:22.860]  This is leaking out and I don't think they're going to be able to unring this bell.
[02:40:22.860 --> 02:40:24.981]  But you're right, there is a fight on.
[02:40:24.981 --> 02:40:28.622]  I didn't want to be a part of this fight.
[02:40:28.622 --> 02:40:30.943]  I made the film bought for my daughter.
[02:40:31.283 --> 02:40:40.925]  Who's 32 years old, has three children, and my goal was to have the conversation for her that she doesn't want to have with her friends.
[02:40:40.925 --> 02:40:50.927]  I literally just wanted to create a place, a safe space, to have a conversation to say, wait a minute, there are two sides to this story, we need to look at it.
[02:40:50.927 --> 02:40:55.828]  Unfortunately, I don't think we get to have that rational conversation.
[02:40:55.828 --> 02:40:57.148]  It really is a battle.
[02:40:57.978 --> 02:40:58.760]  You're absolutely right.
[02:40:58.760 --> 02:41:01.785]  And up on screen, we can go to InfoWars.com and show the headlines.
[02:41:01.785 --> 02:41:04.491]  Fed preparing to invade Texas.
[02:41:04.491 --> 02:41:08.178]  Joint military forces to engage in urban warfare training with citizens.
[02:41:08.178 --> 02:41:09.581]  They list the state as hostile.
[02:41:10.687 --> 02:41:13.030]  And this should be big national news.
[02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:25.064]  They're going to be running it out of the army base, Camp Swift, a former prisoner of war camp, and down at Joint Task Force 6 at Fort Bliss.
[02:41:25.064 --> 02:41:29.809]  And they only list Utah as the only other area listed as a hostile state.
[02:41:30.510 --> 02:41:33.572]  So they're afraid of... Utah's been fighting.
[02:41:33.572 --> 02:41:35.574]  Man, they were really... This is insane.
[02:41:35.574 --> 02:41:38.536]  I mean, that they would be this bold and list the entire state.
[02:41:38.536 --> 02:41:43.420]  But I guess they have had a lot of county judges and others say they're not gonna go along with gun confiscation.
[02:41:43.420 --> 02:41:45.601]  They've had police departments say they're not gonna be part of it.
[02:41:45.601 --> 02:41:46.142]  And sheriffs...
[02:41:47.170 --> 02:41:48.651]  I can't believe we've reached this point.
[02:41:48.651 --> 02:41:59.118]  You know, four years ago when the legislature was passing a law that unanimously passed at the House to not let TSA grope genitals, Obama said, I will have F-16s blockade your state.
[02:41:59.118 --> 02:42:00.159]  No commercial aircraft.
[02:42:00.159 --> 02:42:03.941]  That was in the Austin American States when in AP.
[02:42:03.941 --> 02:42:07.624]  I mean, if tyranny came along, Jeff, would we notice it is the question?
[02:42:09.137 --> 02:42:12.119]  And that's the hard part.
[02:42:12.119 --> 02:42:15.622]  It's a seduction where it's just a little bit different than yesterday.
[02:42:15.622 --> 02:42:24.088]  But... That's right, it didn't come in a Hitler outfit, it didn't come in, you know, the old tyrannies, and it's done incrementally, so how do we recognize it and fight it?
[02:42:24.941 --> 02:42:32.707]  It's funny, I remember after 9-11, when I walked through the airport, how delighted I was to see our National Guard there.
[02:42:32.707 --> 02:42:36.530]  And I love those guys, and I'm glad they were there.
[02:42:36.530 --> 02:42:46.858]  There comes a point, though, when something like that happens, and then we give away our freedoms, and willingly, and one after the other.
[02:42:46.858 --> 02:42:53.243]  Sure, and it's not the troops that are bad, it's that they're using threats as a pretext to take our liberties that aren't even about the threat.
[02:42:54.503 --> 02:42:58.831]  Absolutely, and getting us to willingly go along with it out of fear.
[02:43:00.649 --> 02:43:01.129]  Wow.
[02:43:01.129 --> 02:43:11.776]  Well, listen, I want to invite you back up soon, Jeff, as soon as we're carrying the other film bought, as soon as I buy a bunch of those and sell them on the Infowarsstore.com area.
[02:43:11.776 --> 02:43:13.418]  Doctored is available there right now.
[02:43:13.418 --> 02:43:16.660]  Bought is available at JeffHaysFilms.com or everywhere.
[02:43:16.660 --> 02:43:18.081]  It's the bestseller.
[02:43:18.081 --> 02:43:21.403]  And people putting out reality like you, you know, you're successful.
[02:43:21.403 --> 02:43:22.484]  Mainstream media is dying.
[02:43:22.484 --> 02:43:23.204]  We're successful.
[02:43:23.204 --> 02:43:24.885]  Mainstream media is dying.
[02:43:24.885 --> 02:43:30.049]  We still can vote with our dollars in the free market while we still have that and maybe turn this around peacefully.
[02:43:30.049 --> 02:43:30.509]  Jeff, thank you.
[02:43:31.149 --> 02:43:32.590]  Thank you so much for having me.
[02:43:32.590 --> 02:43:32.970]  Thank you.
[02:43:32.970 --> 02:43:34.371]  Well, amazing filmmaker.
[02:43:34.371 --> 02:43:35.151]  Really impressed.
[02:43:35.151 --> 02:43:37.993]  Can't wait to see the other film.
[02:43:37.993 --> 02:43:43.696]  Just briefly, then I'm going to your calls.
[02:43:43.696 --> 02:43:44.856]  I got up about 6 a.m.
[02:43:44.856 --> 02:43:59.604]  this morning and it was still dark and I was walking down the hall to get coffee and I just sat down in a chair in the dark looking out the window at the mist on the hills and I just thought, oh my god,
[02:44:02.102 --> 02:44:03.822]  It's all accurate.
[02:44:03.822 --> 02:44:07.343]  It's worse than we thought, though.
[02:44:07.343 --> 02:44:13.305]  And it's just insane that the elite are this bad.
[02:44:13.305 --> 02:44:19.466]  I mean, folks, liberty and free market is an engine of so much wealth, it'll make your head spin.
[02:44:19.466 --> 02:44:22.307]  They have purposefully dumbed the public down, made them lazy.
[02:44:22.307 --> 02:44:24.287]  They have purposely screwed everything over.
[02:44:24.287 --> 02:44:27.868]  They have purposely tried to break up families and create mental illness viruses out there.
[02:44:29.804 --> 02:44:33.446]  They're openly announcing everything's being watched and tracked with AI.
[02:44:33.446 --> 02:44:40.011]  They're openly announcing once this is all in place, they're going to start exterminating everybody with hard kill, not just soft kill.
[02:44:40.011 --> 02:44:48.797]  They're openly saying that Texas is a hostile force, that Texas is a hostile state to the
[02:44:49.921 --> 02:45:03.926]  Northcom and the Joint Special Forces Command, and they're going to have the Navy SEALs and the Delta Force and the Marines and the Army all training with local police and everybody for snatching grabs and taking over county courthouses from governments that don't go along.
[02:45:03.926 --> 02:45:06.847]  I mean, you know what's going to happen if a civil war starts and they blow stuff up?
[02:45:06.847 --> 02:45:09.628]  The patriots are going to get the word out that they didn't do it.
[02:45:09.628 --> 02:45:16.611]  The first few courthouses, the first few places, you're going to successfully go in and kill the local sheriffs and people and the citizens that fight you.
[02:45:17.247 --> 02:45:23.373]  But then after that, the rest of the military is going to see through it, and then the officers, everybody knows what's going to happen.
[02:45:23.373 --> 02:45:27.057]  I'm not even going to go into it, but the military has all had this discussion.
[02:45:27.057 --> 02:45:37.688]  So the minute you try to pull this, and they call all the enlisted in with the non-commissioned officers, and the colonel comes in and goes, men, they just hit Dallas with a low yield.
[02:45:37.688 --> 02:45:39.430]  The Patriots working with Al-Qaeda.
[02:45:40.356 --> 02:45:41.437]  We've got intel.
[02:45:41.437 --> 02:45:42.057]  We arrested them.
[02:45:42.057 --> 02:45:43.318]  They've admitted it.
[02:45:43.318 --> 02:45:44.859]  And now we're going to have to go in.
[02:45:44.859 --> 02:45:46.140]  Here's a list of 2,000 people we think are involved.
[02:45:46.140 --> 02:45:51.463]  We're going to start looking at the list and it's like, Ron Paul and Alex Jones, all these people.
[02:45:51.463 --> 02:45:53.805]  And the military is all going to say, eh, start.
[02:45:53.805 --> 02:45:55.506]  And then, yeah, they'll go after some of the first targets.
[02:45:55.506 --> 02:45:57.827]  And then by then they'll go, this is all made up.
[02:45:57.827 --> 02:46:00.089]  And then it is going to go wild.
[02:46:01.889 --> 02:46:08.374]  And they want to wait till their drones and robots are all in place to autonomously take people out and then to diet later or claim it was a Chinese hack or whatever.
[02:46:08.374 --> 02:46:11.336]  I mean, I've war-gamed all this in the brain God gave me.
[02:46:11.336 --> 02:46:12.136]  It ain't gonna work.
[02:46:12.136 --> 02:46:21.923]  I mean, let me tell George Soros and all the rest of us, this is not gonna fly, it isn't gonna hunt, it ain't gonna float.
[02:46:21.923 --> 02:46:22.984]  And that's not wishful thinking.
[02:46:22.984 --> 02:46:28.668]  I mean, my gut, my brain, my intellect, historically, I've studied this, I'm not a lazy person.
[02:46:30.182 --> 02:46:38.089]  I'm not bragging, but just about general concepts, I could sit around talking about quantum mechanics and M-theory with people.
[02:46:38.089 --> 02:46:52.883]  I'm sitting there with William Binney and I go, but doesn't a hologram of a mathematical equation of something with that much data create mathematically its own mass and create a distortion mirror of the sub-key, a projection of the dark matter coding?
[02:46:52.883 --> 02:46:55.045]  And he was just like, I'm not talking about classified stuff.
[02:46:55.726 --> 02:46:57.168]  And I said, I don't want to know classified stuff.
[02:46:57.168 --> 02:47:00.473]  And he was, and of course, Buckley's real smart and people were there.
[02:47:00.473 --> 02:47:02.275]  They're like, but Alex, what are you getting into?
[02:47:02.275 --> 02:47:06.061]  And I just suddenly understood what, I just sort of started spouting this stuff off.
[02:47:06.061 --> 02:47:07.943]  I don't even know how I know all this stuff, folks.
[02:47:07.943 --> 02:47:09.606]  Half the time, it just starts spewing out of my mouth.
[02:47:13.882 --> 02:47:19.627]  But I know that in the universe, they look at older parts of it and it's distorted and matter moves at a different rate.
[02:47:19.627 --> 02:47:33.019]  I know that with the mathematic equations of a French physicist, I forget his name, with the hexagon formations on the north and south pole of Saturn, that he predicted that when the probe flew over it, that it would show those patterns because of an interdimensional
[02:47:33.959 --> 02:47:38.403]  Projection of dark matter from the mass of it being so large.
[02:47:38.403 --> 02:47:39.284]  And I'm no mathematician.
[02:47:39.284 --> 02:47:40.565]  I understand the basic concepts.
[02:47:40.565 --> 02:47:42.207]  It's like it leaves a ghost image.
[02:47:42.207 --> 02:47:43.888]  I don't know why I'm going off into all that.
[02:47:43.888 --> 02:47:48.232]  I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[02:47:48.232 --> 02:47:50.674]  It's just that I understand the enemy operation.
[02:47:50.674 --> 02:47:51.255]  I see it.
[02:47:51.255 --> 02:47:52.456]  I see the codes.
[02:47:52.456 --> 02:47:53.337]  I see the patterns.
[02:47:53.337 --> 02:47:55.939]  I know what they're going to do before they do it.
[02:47:55.939 --> 02:47:58.722]  But it's not hard now, ladies and gentlemen, to see what's going on.
[02:48:08.677 --> 02:48:10.118]  It's just incredible to be alive.
[02:48:10.118 --> 02:48:11.279]  The world is so wonderful.
[02:48:11.279 --> 02:48:13.100]  The universe is so incredible.
[02:48:13.100 --> 02:48:14.521]  There's so much good in the world.
[02:48:14.521 --> 02:48:17.663]  And the globalists want to dominate culture and make us look at them.
[02:48:17.663 --> 02:48:25.307]  Make our kids go in McDonald's with dead babies and skulls on the door, laughing at us like we're unconscious baboons.
[02:48:25.307 --> 02:48:31.331]  A bunch of boobies.
[02:48:31.331 --> 02:48:35.854]  A boobie's a stupid pirate before the FCC tries to say I'm using bad words there.
[02:48:35.854 --> 02:48:37.075]  The level of ignorance, it's like a...
[02:48:42.571 --> 02:48:43.712]  It's all too insane.
[02:48:43.712 --> 02:48:47.993]  It's all... Can't make this up.
[02:48:47.993 --> 02:48:49.674]  Charlie Sheen calling me.
[02:48:49.674 --> 02:48:54.416]  I gotta take this.
[02:48:54.416 --> 02:48:55.277]  Hey, bro!
[02:48:55.277 --> 02:48:55.777]  I'm on air.
[02:48:55.777 --> 02:48:58.158]  Can I call you right back in 10 minutes?
[02:48:58.158 --> 02:48:58.798]  I'm so sorry.
[02:48:58.798 --> 02:49:00.079]  Yeah, I'm on air.
[02:49:00.079 --> 02:49:09.223]  I've been... Well, listen, you're awesome.
[02:49:09.223 --> 02:49:09.923]  Yes, they are.
[02:49:09.923 --> 02:49:10.423]  Yes, they are.
[02:49:10.423 --> 02:49:11.144]  But if you're going to... Yeah.
[02:49:16.333 --> 02:49:17.073]  Hold on one second.
[02:49:17.073 --> 02:49:22.535]  I'm gonna tell them I'm gonna tell them play a Despotism thing in the break so I can talk to you now and we'll come back.
[02:49:22.535 --> 02:49:22.835]  Okay?
[02:49:22.835 --> 02:49:23.256]  Okay.
[02:49:23.256 --> 02:49:23.956]  No, no, no.
[02:49:23.956 --> 02:49:24.436]  I got time.
[02:49:24.436 --> 02:49:25.356]  Go ahead and roll something guys.
[02:49:25.356 --> 02:49:26.317]  I'm gonna hear this.
[02:49:26.317 --> 02:49:26.957]  Okay.
[02:49:26.957 --> 02:49:33.179]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:49:33.179 --> 02:49:38.021]  As a community moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people.
[02:49:40.931 --> 02:49:50.136]  That's veteran Denver Police Officer Charles Jones IV smashing an unarmed suspect in the face six times.
[02:49:50.136 --> 02:49:54.498]  Officers accused of using excessive force on a suspect and then trying to erase the evidence.
[02:49:54.498 --> 02:49:59.141]  I'm observing what they're doing and they're all saying to me, I don't understand what's going on.
[02:49:59.141 --> 02:50:08.706]  A community rates low on an information scale when the press, radio and other channels of communication are controlled by only a few people.
[02:50:09.702 --> 02:50:17.444]  Does it raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government?
[02:50:17.444 --> 02:50:19.024]  How can you ask such a question?
[02:50:19.024 --> 02:50:21.945]  What difference at this point does it make?
[02:50:21.945 --> 02:50:29.347]  When a confident observer looks for signs of despotism in the community, he looks beyond fine words and noble phrases.
[02:50:29.347 --> 02:50:36.649]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.
[02:50:37.799 --> 02:50:40.001]  Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.
[02:50:40.001 --> 02:50:41.382]  What I say, go.
[02:50:41.382 --> 02:50:42.222]  See?
[02:50:42.222 --> 02:50:46.465]  I'm the law around here.
[02:50:46.465 --> 02:50:51.629]  He came, he saw, he died.
[02:50:51.629 --> 02:50:55.031]  Yes, in modern warfare, our military leaders are finding the
[02:51:00.163 --> 02:51:02.284]  The human body is extraordinary.
[02:51:02.284 --> 02:51:06.487]  Despite all the stresses we inflict upon it, it still works hard to stay in balance.

[02:53:09.188 --> 02:53:10.749]  The answer is clear.
[02:53:10.749 --> 02:53:13.331]  Get prepared and you get prepared now.
[02:53:13.331 --> 02:53:15.893]  Now the only question left is where do we begin?

[02:53:49.279 --> 02:53:49.679]  Call right now!
[02:54:01.331 --> 02:54:07.595]  Yeah, folks, I didn't jump off air just because my good buddy Charlie called up.
[02:54:07.595 --> 02:54:11.398]  By the way, Charlie's clean, healthy, he's drinking a little bit, but not doing drugs.
[02:54:11.398 --> 02:54:14.220]  Hung out with him when he was here in Austin a few weeks ago.
[02:54:14.220 --> 02:54:19.484]  But the media's trying to claim he's racist for criticizing Barack Hussein Obama.
[02:54:19.484 --> 02:54:22.587]  And he made the joke, you know, that Obama says he's Kenyan.
[02:54:22.587 --> 02:54:26.089]  Obama said last week in a speech that I wouldn't have moved to the U.S.
[02:54:26.089 --> 02:54:26.750]  if I didn't love it.
[02:54:27.833 --> 02:54:30.755]  Okay, so Charlie made a joke too, they're calling him racist.
[02:54:30.755 --> 02:54:37.119]  Doesn't matter who you are, Charlie Sheen or whoever, you have a right to make fun of the President, especially when he makes fun of himself.
[02:54:37.119 --> 02:54:46.685]  So Charlie wants me to put on an official statement, he was ready to give it to me right then, but I just couldn't get it done before I came back from break, so when the show ends, we're gonna go with Charlie, write the response for the media.
[02:54:46.685 --> 02:54:47.946]  No big deal.
[02:54:47.946 --> 02:54:54.490]  That's what, that's why that was going on, because, you know, if they were saying I was racist, I would want to respond to it as well.
[02:54:54.490 --> 02:54:57.192]  So, is Obama racist for saying he's from Kenya?
[02:54:58.166 --> 02:55:00.167]  Pat, can you guys cue that video up?
[02:55:00.167 --> 02:55:00.907]  I mean, I know we have it.
[02:55:00.907 --> 02:55:02.768]  He said it last week.
[02:55:02.768 --> 02:55:09.331]  Jim in Texas wants to talk about the Pentagon listing Texas as hostile and practicing invasion takeover drills.
[02:55:09.331 --> 02:55:11.872]  That story is now on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:55:11.872 --> 02:55:16.194]  Jim in Texas, what's your take on this?
[02:55:16.194 --> 02:55:16.614]  Hello, Alex.
[02:55:16.614 --> 02:55:17.294]  How are you today?
[02:55:17.294 --> 02:55:17.714]  Good, brother.
[02:55:17.714 --> 02:55:19.395]  Go ahead.
[02:55:19.395 --> 02:55:24.017]  Well, I just heard that earlier today, and I happen to be a border agent here on the border.
[02:55:24.017 --> 02:55:25.958]  I don't really care if they know or not.
[02:55:27.463 --> 02:55:32.968]  Just to let you know, many people down here in law enforcement, not just working the border.
[02:55:32.968 --> 02:55:38.913]  I'm also a law enforcement officer from here my whole adult life.
[02:55:38.913 --> 02:55:42.737]  Many people are aware of what's going on with the country.
[02:55:42.737 --> 02:55:44.198]  Not too happy about it.
[02:55:44.198 --> 02:55:47.080]  Obviously, we took an oath to do our job.
[02:55:47.080 --> 02:55:50.163]  We do the best we can down here.
[02:55:50.163 --> 02:55:54.507]  But I want to thank you for, you know, doing what you do and waking people up.
[02:55:55.609 --> 02:55:59.551]  A lot of these things five years ago sounded a little weird.
[02:55:59.551 --> 02:56:01.452]  But it's all pretty much fallen into place.
[02:56:01.452 --> 02:56:04.513]  So I basically just called up to thank you.
[02:56:04.513 --> 02:56:05.774]  Well, please don't thank me.
[02:56:05.774 --> 02:56:09.896]  Everybody knows Border Patrol has probably the roughest job in the country.
[02:56:09.896 --> 02:56:14.918]  And just with your hands tied behind your back in just a Wild West crazy town.
[02:56:14.918 --> 02:56:17.619]  And so we appreciate you.
[02:56:17.619 --> 02:56:23.042]  Well, you know, I just want people to understand that, you know, the people that are working down here are good people.
[02:56:24.443 --> 02:56:34.847]  A lot of the things that are going on here are out of the control of many people working down here, but it doesn't mean that we don't love the people and love the service that we do.
[02:56:34.847 --> 02:56:37.228]  It's pretty sad to see what's taking place here.
[02:56:37.228 --> 02:56:41.570]  What do you make of the Pentagon listing Texas as hostile in drills?
[02:56:41.570 --> 02:56:43.691]  I mean, this is bold.
[02:56:43.691 --> 02:56:48.173]  Well, I don't understand why people are doing military exercises often.
[02:56:48.789 --> 02:56:49.229]  Absolutely.
[02:57:13.933 --> 02:57:16.034]  You know, we don't, we don't want violence.
[02:57:16.034 --> 02:57:18.655]  We don't, you know, but we're not gonna, I'm an American.
[02:57:18.655 --> 02:57:20.696]  I'm not a North American Union guy.
[02:57:20.696 --> 02:57:21.516]  I'm an American.
[02:57:21.516 --> 02:57:24.057]  Well, let me ask you this question.
[02:57:24.057 --> 02:57:27.979]  Plus, you know, the NAU is unelected, a bunch of globalists.
[02:57:27.979 --> 02:57:34.362]  Do the globalists know that the police and military are more awake than the general public and that this isn't gonna go the way they think?
[02:57:34.362 --> 02:57:36.843]  I don't know what they're thinking.
[02:57:36.843 --> 02:57:41.705]  Well, I can tell you right now it's not gonna go the way they think because, you know, for the majority of us, I mean,
[02:57:42.577 --> 02:57:46.740]  When you take a note, you know, to the Constitution, you're not taking a note to a politician.
[02:57:46.740 --> 02:57:48.141]  That's what these people don't understand.
[02:57:48.141 --> 02:57:50.642]  You know, we took a note to uphold the law.
[02:57:50.642 --> 02:58:00.729]  And, you know, the more that things fall, in my opinion, out of control, and morally we seem to be aspiring out of control, you know, the worse the situation gets.
[02:58:00.729 --> 02:58:02.030]  But when you realize that
[02:58:02.691 --> 02:58:20.867]  A lot of these people are dependent because they've been made dependent and it's a sad situation to try to take down an economic machine that has worked and has been prosperous for many people over many, many generations and now we're about to just completely divide us and tear us apart and there's no reason for all this.
[02:58:21.307 --> 02:58:22.167]  Absolutely, Jim.
[02:58:22.167 --> 02:58:23.347]  Thank you so much.
[02:58:23.347 --> 02:58:31.169]  That's why I'm not anti-police and Border Patrol and stuff, because the average person I talk to from those groups is just ten times more awake than the public.
[02:58:31.169 --> 02:58:33.329]  So our job is to get the public awake.
[02:58:33.329 --> 02:58:35.070]  We're supposedly in charge of the government.
[02:58:35.070 --> 02:58:36.730]  We're the ones letting the government be out of control.
[02:58:36.730 --> 02:58:42.691]  A little bit of overdrive coming up to talk to Pete, Neil, and others.
[02:58:42.691 --> 02:58:46.652]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:50.308 --> 02:58:51.308]  Alex Jones here.
[02:58:51.308 --> 02:59:00.472]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:59:00.472 --> 02:59:05.694]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.
[02:59:06.034 --> 02:59:09.755]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[02:59:09.755 --> 02:59:19.297]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge and prepare your body for what experts admit is the most dangerous season of the year.
[02:59:19.297 --> 02:59:30.719]  We have rejected hundreds of other formulations in our quest to bring you what is simply the most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that we have ever created in the realm of herbal immunity.
[02:59:30.719 --> 02:59:35.480]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts
[02:59:35.700 --> 02:59:37.642]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:02.651 --> 03:00:09.296]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:09.296 --> 03:00:14.901]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:14.901 --> 03:00:17.323]  Final segment.
[03:00:17.323 --> 03:00:20.385]  Just incredible to see all this unfolding.
[03:00:20.385 --> 03:00:28.232]  I cannot get over the fact the Pentagon lists the United States, Texas as a hostile area, that and Utah.
[03:00:29.477 --> 03:00:31.737]  And where are people prepared to know about the globalist takeover?
[03:00:31.737 --> 03:00:34.238]  Texas and Utah.
[03:00:34.238 --> 03:00:38.179]  Feds preparing to invade Texas is the headline.
[03:00:38.179 --> 03:00:39.499]  And again, they had a better headline.
[03:00:39.499 --> 03:00:41.839]  I told them to change it and put list state as hostile.
[03:00:41.839 --> 03:00:45.080]  I just wanted that added to the other headline they had.
[03:00:45.080 --> 03:00:49.481]  Their old sub-headline was excellent about deploying the military.
[03:00:49.481 --> 03:00:50.941]  But then they list the state as hostile.
[03:00:50.941 --> 03:00:53.062]  That's the added thing I need in the headline.
[03:00:53.062 --> 03:00:54.962]  To really get the facts out to everybody out there.
[03:00:55.939 --> 03:00:56.940]  Okay, writers, thank you.
[03:00:56.940 --> 03:01:00.142]  I know they're beefing it up right now, adding a bunch of documentation and everything.
[03:01:00.142 --> 03:01:02.384]  Pete, in FEMA Region 9, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:01:02.384 --> 03:01:05.046]  Go ahead.
[03:01:05.046 --> 03:01:06.287]  Alex Jones, you crazy man.
[03:01:06.287 --> 03:01:10.531]  I don't know why you can't just turn in your guns, take your vaccines, eat your McDonald's and be quiet.
[03:01:10.531 --> 03:01:11.532]  I don't know why.
[03:01:11.532 --> 03:01:12.873]  Exactly, it's extreme.
[03:01:12.873 --> 03:01:16.115]  I mean, you know, so what?
[03:01:16.115 --> 03:01:17.316]  So, and you know what?
[03:01:17.316 --> 03:01:19.958]  Just real quick, I'm calling out a moderator.
[03:01:19.958 --> 03:01:22.861]  I listed you on 1080 and 1340 KMY, Michael's Whirling Station.
[03:01:25.117 --> 03:01:39.984]  I just want, real quick before I get to my point, if anybody ever questions this guy's passion, I saw him speak at Coconut Growth, and Alex, I gotta say, it was very motivational, and at times, it looked to me like you broke down and had tears in your eyes.
[03:01:39.984 --> 03:01:42.685]  So, this man believes everything that he is saying.
[03:01:42.685 --> 03:01:48.348]  Oh, I get tears in my eyes all the time, not of fear, but sadness of how bad this is.
[03:01:48.348 --> 03:01:50.909]  It's passionate sadness, yes, I know, and I saw that.
[03:01:52.088 --> 03:02:08.439]  So anyways, what I want to get to is Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors, and I've kind of been digging into this while I've been on hold, I sent a link out to your Twitter account, and I sent a link out to Joe Biggs, and I sent a link out to Showtips.
[03:02:08.439 --> 03:02:11.902]  Santa Cruz Sentinel had an article about an agenda
[03:02:13.553 --> 03:02:18.717]  thing that was brought up to the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors.
[03:02:18.717 --> 03:02:27.003]  I don't know if it's an actual bill, or if it's in support of a letter of SB 277, which is to get rid of the exemptions in California.
[03:02:27.003 --> 03:02:31.027]  That's right, forced inoculations.
[03:02:31.027 --> 03:02:31.847]  Right.
[03:02:31.847 --> 03:02:37.572]  So, like I said, I'm still digging into this as I'm talking to you right now, and I'll forward the links as I go.
[03:02:39.228 --> 03:02:47.092]  I just got one thing to say, you know, New World Order, Obama, federal government, state government, local government, there's only one way you're going to forcibly inoculate my children.
[03:02:47.092 --> 03:02:49.954]  You're going to have to step over my dead body.
[03:02:49.954 --> 03:02:54.656]  Well that's, here's the deal, they're trying to do stuff they know will cause a civil war.
[03:02:54.656 --> 03:03:06.863]  Guns, forced inoculations, and again, putting the enforcers in the middle of this, the enforcers need to say no, they're citizens as well, and say we're going to be peace officers, we're not going to enforce unconstitutional garbage.
[03:03:07.662 --> 03:03:10.064]  I mean, this is totalitarianism 101.
[03:03:10.064 --> 03:03:11.225]  Good to hear from you, Pete.
[03:03:11.225 --> 03:03:13.126]  Pam is the last caller we have time for.
[03:03:13.126 --> 03:03:14.307]  Sorry to mention Justin.
[03:03:14.307 --> 03:03:16.349]  Pam, you're our tail gunner today from Tennessee.
[03:03:16.349 --> 03:03:18.170]  Welcome.
[03:03:18.170 --> 03:03:18.811]  Hey, Alex.
[03:03:18.811 --> 03:03:20.412]  How are you doing today?
[03:03:20.412 --> 03:03:22.974]  I'm telling you, I'm really getting freaked out.
[03:03:22.974 --> 03:03:24.756]  Stuff's moving so fast, it's crazy.
[03:03:26.553 --> 03:03:28.394]  Well, I'm with you, brother, all the way.
[03:03:28.394 --> 03:03:35.359]  Um, listen, I take the, uh, Secret 12, and I do that on my tongue, and I wash it with, uh, water.
[03:03:35.359 --> 03:03:46.387]  But I'm taking the Survival Shield and the Silver Bullet, and I just take one of the Silver Bullet and about five drops of the, uh, Survival Shield X2, and I stick that in my coffee.
[03:03:46.387 --> 03:03:49.489]  Well, do you like it?
[03:03:50.652 --> 03:03:53.713]  And it's, you know, you can't really taste it.
[03:03:53.713 --> 03:03:59.815]  So, you know, I know you show where you're putting it in your water, but it's actually good in the coffee.
[03:03:59.815 --> 03:04:02.656]  Sure, but you can put it on your tongue or put it in water, put it in coffee.
[03:04:02.656 --> 03:04:09.019]  You know, too much heat can kind of break down vitamins and nutrients, but a little bit of heat's not going to hurt it from our experience.
[03:04:09.019 --> 03:04:09.659]  Have you liked it?
[03:04:09.659 --> 03:04:12.760]  Have you had anything happen since you've been taking the nutraceuticals?
[03:04:14.028 --> 03:04:15.288]  No, I love it.
[03:04:15.288 --> 03:04:20.709]  And you know, I haven't been sick, and since I've been taking this, I haven't gotten anything.
[03:04:20.709 --> 03:04:26.470]  And I just think it's a blessing, and I think that people need to support you, because you really need that right now.
[03:04:26.470 --> 03:04:29.991]  Well, you sound like a sweetheart, I tell you, and a good Tennessee lady.
[03:04:29.991 --> 03:04:30.931]  You're a sweetheart, ma'am.
[03:04:30.931 --> 03:04:31.591]  We're out of time.
[03:04:31.591 --> 03:04:32.671]  God bless you.
[03:04:32.671 --> 03:04:40.773]  I'm gonna go get all the rest of the news out, ladies and gentlemen, and there is a lot of it at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and
[03:04:41.820 --> 03:04:49.928]  We're talking about the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock central, and all the South by Southwest angles on GMOs, globalization, militarization of police.
[03:04:49.928 --> 03:04:55.034]  Joe Biggs, former Staff Sergeant, is working on a big report on this military invasion of Texas.
[03:04:55.034 --> 03:04:56.135]  Can't believe I'm actually saying this.
[03:04:56.135 --> 03:04:57.837]  This is like Red Dawn.
[03:04:57.837 --> 03:04:57.977]  Huh!
