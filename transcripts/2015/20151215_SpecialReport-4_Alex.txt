[00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.202]  The Starbucks Holiday Cup Controversy.
[00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:10.983]  I know, who really cares, right?
[00:00:11.103 --> 00:00:15.486]  The arrival of Starbucks Holiday themed cups means Christmas is on the way.
[00:00:15.886 --> 00:00:16.667]  It's huge.
[00:00:16.807 --> 00:00:22.891]  People who don't even go to Starbucks regularly, they come during the holidays because we have the red cups.
[00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:26.173]  This year's design is just a plain red cup.
[00:00:26.554 --> 00:00:34.380]  Granting a corporate entity a controversial stranglehold over a Christian holiday takes the Christ out of Christmas.
[00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:38.244]  But to most Americans, something just doesn't feel right.
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:59.124]  Maybe it's the constant barrage of media surrounding the war between left-wing mandates and religious beliefs in America.
[00:00:59.804 --> 00:01:01.165]  Absolutely ludicrous!
[00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.026]  Don't smile at me.
[00:01:03.046 --> 00:01:08.689]  I'm not being disrespectful to you.
[00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:12.891]  You absolutely have disrespecting us as second-class citizens is what you're doing.
[00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:15.393]  You're telling us that we don't deserve the same rights that you have.
[00:01:15.673 --> 00:01:17.274]  That you've enjoyed your entire life.
[00:01:18.054 --> 00:01:19.395]  Would you do this to an interracial couple?
[00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:22.859]  Obama,
[00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.401]  And I'll say it straight up because no one else will.
[00:01:48.461 --> 00:01:48.821]  You will.
[00:01:49.461 --> 00:01:51.063]  Obama is a Muslim through and through.
[00:01:51.083 --> 00:01:54.185]  Obama sympathizes with a Muslim caliphate.
[00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:58.148]  Obama simplifies... simplifies with the mullahs in Tehran.
[00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:01.731]  He sympathizes with the radicals in the Far East.
[00:02:01.811 --> 00:02:04.613]  And that's why he never holds any of them accountable.
[00:02:04.814 --> 00:02:06.835]  He doesn't sympathize with Christians and Jews.
[00:02:07.296 --> 00:02:08.977]  He sympathizes with his own people.
[00:02:09.597 --> 00:02:11.119]  And that's why these things are happening.
[00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:13.941]  And it's time that someone called it like it is.
[00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:22.119]  And that's why, you know Alex, a couple years ago I was in front of the World War II Memorial, and it rang true, and it rings true now more than ever.
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:29.008]  I said, President Obama, get up off your knees, put the Quran down, and come out with your hands up.
[00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.311]  He is not for Christians and Jews.
[00:02:31.772 --> 00:02:32.473]  He's for Muslims.
[00:02:32.904 --> 00:02:41.287]  Or maybe it's the knowledge, conscious or unconscious, that Christians are being wiped out in the Middle East and in Africa, and fleeing to America.
[00:02:41.587 --> 00:02:55.872]  The Daily Mail reports, in Iraq, where Christians are being butchered in mass executions by the Islamic State, their number has plunged from 1 million to just 275,000 in the last 12 years alone.
[00:02:56.332 --> 00:02:59.994]  In parts of the Middle East, particularly in Syria and Iraq,
[00:03:00.774 --> 00:03:12.343]  The crisis is so severe that, barring significant interventions on the part of the world powers, the Christian presence may disappear completely within a decade or even sooner.
[00:03:12.924 --> 00:03:23.492]  Elijah Brown of 21st Century Wilberforce said, Last Christmas was the first time that bells did not ring out in the city of Mosul in 2,000 years.
[00:03:23.892 --> 00:03:28.336]  I think that speaks to the reality that hundreds of thousands of Christian families
[00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:29.117]  We're good to go.
[00:04:04.053 --> 00:04:10.175]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forklift situation?
[00:04:10.195 --> 00:04:13.537]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:04:13.637 --> 00:04:15.237]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:04:15.277 --> 00:04:21.520]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.502]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:04:27.682 --> 00:04:31.445]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:04:31.645 --> 00:04:34.568]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:04:34.728 --> 00:04:42.714]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:04:42.994 --> 00:04:45.036]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:04:45.096 --> 00:04:46.137]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:04:46.497 --> 00:04:55.246]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
