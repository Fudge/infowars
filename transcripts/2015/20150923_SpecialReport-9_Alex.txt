[00:00:03.973 --> 00:00:22.792]  Five years into the Syrian civil war, a media blackout is settling over the conflict as the United Nations, a supposed moderate rebel army, and a 2015 Bilderberg agenda priority carve a path to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
[00:00:23.152 --> 00:00:37.386]  After collapsing the Libyan economy, unseating and killing Gaddafi, and pilfering the Libyan stockpile of weapons to arm ISIS, the Obama White House's next task was to execute a duplicate illegal hit job on Assad's Syria.
[00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:41.170]  Assad has been fighting the New World Order cancer ever since.
[00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:50.033]  In 2014, Pulitzer Prize winning investigative journalist Seymour Hersh explained the botched weapons of mass destruction's ploy to enter Syria.
[00:00:50.273 --> 00:00:55.735]  Obama's change of mind had its origins at Porton Down, the defense laboratory in Wiltshire.
[00:00:55.915 --> 00:01:04.518]  British intelligence had obtained a sample of the sarin used in the 21st August attack and analysis demonstrated that the gas used didn't match
[00:01:04.938 --> 00:01:05.498]  We're good to go.
[00:01:24.028 --> 00:01:29.152]  and missile attack on Syria's infrastructure could lead to a wider war in the Middle East.
[00:01:29.372 --> 00:01:38.358]  As a consequence, the American officers delivered a last-minute caution to the President, which in their view, eventually led to his cancelling the attack.
[00:01:38.658 --> 00:01:46.544]  Recently, a UN Special Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, launched a disinfo-war attack on Syrian President Assad's character.
[00:01:46.704 --> 00:01:51.467]  Mastura condemned the Syrian government's air raids in the rebel-held Syrian city of Douma.
[00:01:51.647 --> 00:01:55.429]  Mastura called it unacceptable under any circumstances.
[00:01:55.629 --> 00:02:09.378]  Meanwhile, the United Nations has already called for an inclusive transitional governing body with full executive powers to be formed with mutual consent while ensuring continuity of governmental institutions.
[00:02:09.718 --> 00:02:12.260]  It made no mention of President Bashar Assad.
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.681]  For the time being, the United States has dropped
[00:02:15.443 --> 00:02:18.791]  41 million on equipping and training the new Syria force.
[00:02:19.112 --> 00:02:23.563]  An army made up of soldiers ebbing from the factions linked directly to ISIS.
[00:02:23.925 --> 00:02:32.628]  In 2012, your agency was saying, quote, the Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Al-Qaeda in Iraq are the major forces driving the insurgents in Syria.
[00:02:32.988 --> 00:02:34.589]  In 2012, the U.S.
[00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.410]  was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups.
[00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.111]  You knew those groups were around, you saw this analysis, and you were arguing against it.
[00:02:41.151 --> 00:02:42.072]  But who wasn't listening?
[00:02:42.152 --> 00:02:43.292]  I think the administration.
[00:02:43.472 --> 00:02:44.813]  I think it was a willful decision.
[00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:48.634]  You'd have to really ask the President, what is it that he actually is doing?
[00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:53.377]  With the policy that is in place because it is very, very confusing.
[00:02:53.617 --> 00:03:05.025]  I don't see how the Obama administration thought they would get away, I guess they have gotten away, with actually trying to turn Al-Qaeda loose and then having its name changed to ISIS.
[00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:14.412]  The military obviously is speaking out when you've got two recently retired generals coming out saying they were ordered to do this, you know, the administration's behind it.
[00:03:14.592 --> 00:03:17.514]  It was a willful decision to ignore that intelligence.
[00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:23.370]  And proceed with the policy approach of supporting these jihadists.
[00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.831]  It's one of these deals where we basically, the administration lost control of them.
[00:03:30.111 --> 00:03:37.633]  You had Bandar going in and providing arms and what have you to jihadi groups out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:03:38.793 --> 00:03:40.573]  And they still finance them to this day.
[00:03:40.593 --> 00:03:44.314]  And it wasn't just Saudi Arabia, it was UAE and Qatar.
[00:03:44.964 --> 00:03:51.693]  And all of the other Sunni groups that are trying to break up that Shia crescent, as they describe it.
[00:03:52.074 --> 00:04:01.487]  Look, it's not... You know, Iran has its problems, but it's not the one that's supporting these jihadi groups going around killing people, beheading them.
[00:04:02.245 --> 00:04:13.490]  As the Obama Administration once again assumes the public is stupid enough to buy the proxy Syrian Army's putative mission to fight ISIS, it remains conspicuously obvious that Turkish interests have already begun sealing Syria's economic fame.
[00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:46.388]  Gulf News Syria reports recent visitors from Aleppo have confirmed that the opposition local council Aleppo City encouraged several state institutions in Syria's north to use the Turkish lira instead of the Syrian pound as their chief means of exchange.
[00:04:46.688 --> 00:04:56.334]  Syrian President Assad's back is up against the wall as the malevolent claws of the New World Order mutilate his reputation and devour his nation's sovereignty.
[00:04:56.574 --> 00:04:58.075]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:05:05.882 --> 00:05:12.005]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:05:12.025 --> 00:05:15.347]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:05:15.447 --> 00:05:17.048]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
