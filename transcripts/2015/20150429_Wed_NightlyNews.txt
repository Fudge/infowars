[00:00:19.448 --> 00:00:20.328]  Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:20.368 --> 00:00:22.809]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.230]  It is Wednesday, April 29, 2015.
[00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.391]  I'm Darren McBreen.
[00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:29.132]  And I'm Rob Dew, co-hosting.
[00:00:29.412 --> 00:00:30.892]  And here's a look at what we have coming up.
[00:00:33.093 --> 00:00:38.455]  Tonight, the Baltimore Police Department floats a conspiracy theory that black gangs are coming for them.
[00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:42.797]  But black people in Baltimore are forming lines to protect the police.
[00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:45.915]  No!
[00:00:46.195 --> 00:00:48.437]  Do not give him reason!
[00:00:48.517 --> 00:00:53.119]  And we'll be joining InfoWars reporters live on the ground in Baltimore for updates.
[00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:56.281]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:12.934]  Thousands of police and National Guard troops are on the streets tonight in Baltimore, Maryland, in an effort to rid the city of dangerous and violent protesters.
[00:01:13.274 --> 00:01:25.023]  This in the aftermath of the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, who died last week after suffering injuries he received while in police custody.
[00:01:25.304 --> 00:01:26.545]  Here's what we know so far.
[00:01:27.205 --> 00:01:36.534]  On Sunday, April 12th, Freddie Gray became the latest victim in what has become an epidemic of police murders of American citizens.
[00:01:37.175 --> 00:01:42.399]  He was viciously attacked by Baltimore cops and his arrest was captured on video.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.903]  The beating was not captured on video, only the arrest.
[00:01:46.303 --> 00:01:50.689]  But the video shows the officers picking up Freddie Gray from the ground.
[00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.152]  His leg is clearly broken.
[00:01:53.532 --> 00:02:03.765]  He has little control over his body and he is in obvious pain as the cops drag him across the road and dump his body into the back of a police van.
[00:02:04.326 --> 00:02:08.209]  Medical professionals and an ambulance were not immediately called.
[00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:17.555]  Police records show that the arrest took place at 8.45 a.m., but an ambulance was not called until a half an hour later at 9.24.
[00:02:18.316 --> 00:02:29.404]  Freddie Gray was then hospitalized in critical condition and in a coma with a shattered vertebrae, a broken spine, a broken leg, and a crushed larynx.
[00:02:29.964 --> 00:02:35.127]  He died a week later when doctors attempted emergency spinal surgery.
[00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:37.849]  The Baltimore police are reviewing the case.
[00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:46.354]  Six of the cops involved have been suspended with pay, and no more details have been released to the public.
[00:02:46.814 --> 00:02:54.539]  So nobody knows exactly what happened in the back of that police wagon, and we don't know exactly how Freddie got all those injuries, but we do know this.
[00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:59.701]  That is, the Baltimore Police Department, they will be investigating themselves.
[00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:04.003]  And I tell you who's not very happy about that, and that's Freddie Gray's family.
[00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:09.826]  They want the Department of Justice and the FBI to take over the investigation.
[00:03:09.866 --> 00:03:13.447]  They don't trust Baltimore PD's own internal investigation.
[00:03:13.788 --> 00:03:18.550]  And Rob Dew, we were talking earlier how it looks like the police are buying time right now.
[00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.250]  They're trying to get their story straight.
[00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:23.392]  Do you think we'll ever find out what really happened to Freddie Gray?
[00:03:23.792 --> 00:03:25.133]  I don't know if we'll find out what happened to him.
[00:03:25.274 --> 00:03:31.199]  They're going to say he died as a result of his injuries is what is going to come out, and they're going to release that report internally on Friday.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:40.929]  But then, you know, the public is obviously pushing for it to be released on Friday, but we could see a whole new backlash coming from people as soon as that's released.
[00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:43.391]  So that's definitely not a good thing.
[00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:44.712]  It's taken them a long time to do this.
[00:03:45.013 --> 00:03:47.695]  I got an email from a guy who was a former cop, and he said,
[00:03:48.556 --> 00:03:55.239]  They would put people in the back of vans like that and then drive around, sometimes slam on their brakes, make hard turns, and that was to kind of rough them up.
[00:03:56.119 --> 00:04:01.221]  It never resulted in any of these guys dying, but they said they did use that as a tactic for guys that they really didn't like.
[00:04:01.681 --> 00:04:13.626]  So, this guy, you know, Freddie Gray, he had a switchblade on him, and he was, they say he was running from the cops, and they said he looked suspiciously at a cop and then kind of ran off, and that's why they went after him.
[00:04:14.346 --> 00:04:16.469]  So maybe he had history with the cops.
[00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.630]  They said he has a criminal record.
[00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.295]  So maybe this is one of those guys that they said, you know what, we're going to teach this guy a lesson.
[00:04:22.336 --> 00:04:25.540]  But it's not clear whether they put him in the seat belt.
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.401]  Nobody knows any of that.
[00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:29.885]  So it is going to be interesting when the report comes out.
[00:04:29.925 --> 00:04:31.327]  I don't know if that will be the truth, though.
[00:04:31.636 --> 00:04:35.617]  Well, like I said, they are investigating themselves and, you know, that's a shame.
[00:04:35.637 --> 00:04:42.040]  You know, I'll tell you what the community would like to see and most of the protesters, they want these cops arrested.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:49.922]  They want them thrown in jail and they want them charged with murder and they'd like to see someone other than the Baltimore Police Department do the investigation.
[00:04:50.243 --> 00:04:53.244]  And you were talking earlier how he does have a police record.
[00:04:54.004 --> 00:04:55.324]  He saw them early in the morning.
[00:04:55.644 --> 00:04:56.805]  They approached him.
[00:04:57.365 --> 00:04:58.065]  And he ran.
[00:04:58.446 --> 00:05:09.511]  We don't know if his leg got broken during the chase or when they tackled him, but it was obvious that his leg was broken once they caught up to him and once somebody started doing the cell phone recording.
[00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:14.854]  But the family, they believe that his injuries were sustained while in the back of the police wagon.
[00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:19.017]  Right, and at that point when you have somebody with a broken leg, that's when you should call an ambulance.
[00:05:19.157 --> 00:05:20.679]  You should put them in handcuffs.
[00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:25.003]  We saw in Round Rock when the cops smashed the lady's face on the ground.
[00:05:26.844 --> 00:05:30.587]  He said she was drunk, she had some complaints, so he pulls up into the shopping center.
[00:05:31.408 --> 00:05:34.150]  He doesn't think she's cooperating, he grabs her and slams her on the ground.
[00:05:34.471 --> 00:05:35.852]  Well, they called an ambulance for this lady.
[00:05:36.132 --> 00:05:39.914]  And she wasn't nearly as bad off as Freddie Gray was with the leg dangling and all that.
[00:05:39.934 --> 00:05:42.074]  I mean, you can obviously see he's got a broken leg.
[00:05:42.394 --> 00:05:46.056]  And at that point, that's when you call an ambulance to take him.
[00:05:46.456 --> 00:05:50.478]  You know, you keep him in custody, but you take him to see how his injuries are.
[00:05:50.518 --> 00:05:51.198]  And they didn't do that.
[00:05:51.258 --> 00:05:53.319]  So we'll see if anything comes out of that.
[00:05:54.522 --> 00:06:00.084]  Frankly, I don't see the police officers investigating themselves thoroughly at all.
[00:06:00.305 --> 00:06:06.547]  And once again, the racial element is a huge factor, drawing more attention from the mainstream media.
[00:06:06.567 --> 00:06:11.750]  There has been massive protest in Baltimore, followed by widespread looting and arson.
[00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.831]  And this was all expected by the authorities.
[00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:19.333]  But for some reason, the Baltimore police, they were ordered to stand down.
[00:06:19.353 --> 00:06:23.835]  I mean, they were ordered not to stop the looters when the riots exploded.
[00:06:24.295 --> 00:06:24.955]  Over the weekend.
[00:06:25.796 --> 00:06:37.100]  I worked with the police and instructed them to do everything that they could to make sure that the protesters were able to exercise their right to free speech.
[00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:47.725]  It's a very delicate balancing act because while we tried to make sure that they were protected from the cars and the other things that were going on,
[00:06:49.577 --> 00:06:54.180]  We also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that as well.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.762]  That's what we call a stand down, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:57.802 --> 00:06:59.083]  You heard her right there.
[00:06:59.123 --> 00:07:05.387]  I mean, this is the true meaning of order out of chaos, because right on cue, in walks, now we have the police state marching in.
[00:07:05.487 --> 00:07:08.949]  And the National Guard, and the buildup happened faster than in Ferguson.
[00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:12.031]  It took them a few days to get the guys in, but this is what happens.
[00:07:12.071 --> 00:07:18.755]  The police pull back, they let the protesters go crazy, and then they show that on the cameras and they go, look, these people are going crazy, we need to send in
[00:07:19.415 --> 00:07:22.076]  People, and there's always the burning cop car.
[00:07:22.196 --> 00:07:23.577]  That's always the image that they show.
[00:07:24.157 --> 00:07:28.780]  You saw it there with the police van in Baltimore, with the police van.
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:29.780]  But now here, look at this.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.321]  This is Toronto, the G20.
[00:07:31.901 --> 00:07:33.922]  There's a protester there standing in front of that car.
[00:07:33.942 --> 00:07:36.223]  There's a whole story about how this police car caught fire.
[00:07:36.523 --> 00:07:39.225]  The police pull back, and they leave the car sitting there.
[00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:43.487]  They just leave it sitting there in the middle of the road, and so protesters start attacking it.
[00:07:43.527 --> 00:07:47.969]  They slide it on fire, and then the cops move in and start bashing people.
[00:07:48.109 --> 00:07:49.169]  No, they do this all the time.
[00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:52.170]  They did the same thing in Ferguson and they did the same thing the other night.
[00:07:52.510 --> 00:08:00.453]  They put, in Maryland and Baltimore, they put a line of police cars, they abandoned the police cars right there in the middle of the riot zone.
[00:08:00.493 --> 00:08:02.933]  And there's no police around to even watch to see what happens.
[00:08:03.133 --> 00:08:04.894]  But the mainstream media gets called in.
[00:08:05.054 --> 00:08:09.638]  Right, this is a tactic that goes all the way back to the WTO in 1999 in Seattle.
[00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:14.863]  And what happened there was they were protesting, and the first day they shut the city down.
[00:08:15.043 --> 00:08:17.746]  Peaceful protest, shut down this World Trade Organization event.
[00:08:18.326 --> 00:08:24.993]  So the next day, these black box rioters, black box rioters is what they're called, they show up.
[00:08:25.693 --> 00:08:28.035]  They were brought in, they were given a free building to stay in.
[00:08:28.275 --> 00:08:32.618]  They let them go crazy and the cops pull back and just let them loot, break windows, destroy things.
[00:08:32.658 --> 00:08:34.879]  They put it all on cameras, they attack some reporters.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.402]  So the next day, then it's like boom, we're locking down the city.
[00:08:38.462 --> 00:08:39.603]  Nobody gets to go anywhere.
[00:08:39.683 --> 00:08:45.446]  If you have a protest sticker on, a sticker or a pin, you weren't allowed into where the WTO was going.
[00:08:45.687 --> 00:08:48.148]  And they use that to really crack down on the protest.
[00:08:48.168 --> 00:08:50.530]  So this is a tactic they use all the time.
[00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.051]  This isn't just one time.
[00:08:52.451 --> 00:08:54.873]  No, it's been every big incident they do this.
[00:08:55.653 --> 00:09:02.176]  Meanwhile, police in Baltimore are telling reporters that they were actually ordered to stand down, and it's very puzzling.
[00:09:02.676 --> 00:09:03.076]  Or is it?
[00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:21.784]  Because now come to find out, the mayor of Baltimore, she is one of only three mayors that are part of, just happen to be part of President Barack Obama's task force on 21st century policies, and this is a group that, wait for it, it advocates
[00:09:22.344 --> 00:09:25.145]  The federalization of our nation's police departments.
[00:09:25.185 --> 00:09:25.825]  Big surprise.
[00:09:25.905 --> 00:09:35.146]  This is a RAND Corporation plan that was written for the military to come in and how to federalize the police, to create a police stabilization force.
[00:09:35.226 --> 00:09:39.347]  Yeah, destabilize the region, just like they do in third world countries, you know.
[00:09:39.507 --> 00:09:41.507]  They're doing it right here at home, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:42.888]  It's happening right here.
[00:09:43.148 --> 00:09:44.388]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:09:44.648 --> 00:09:45.348]  It's already here.
[00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:49.789]  And on top of that, they are using these tactics of the police are the victims.
[00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:52.450]  You know, they're saying, oh, we're having rocks thrown at us, we're having this thrown at us.
[00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:59.153]  Well, they came out a couple days ago, Kurt Nemo did this article, Black Guerrilla Family, the Bloods, the Crips, plan to take out Baltimore cops.
[00:09:59.453 --> 00:10:01.034]  And I'm going to read from the police department.
[00:10:01.454 --> 00:10:03.094]  It says, credible threat to law enforcement.
[00:10:03.695 --> 00:10:12.138]  The Baltimore Police Department has received credible information that members of various gangs, including the Black Guerrilla Family, Bloods and Crips, have entered into a partnership to take out law enforcement officers.
[00:10:12.498 --> 00:10:13.979]  This is a credible threat.
[00:10:14.439 --> 00:10:16.440]  They say it right there in their paperwork.
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:27.547]  Now, what they were doing was showing, there was Twitter images of Bloods and Crips coming together along with this black guerrilla family, and they're all saying, look, we're coming together to stop the violence, stop the looting.
[00:10:27.928 --> 00:10:30.529]  At least that's what they say when they were interviewed by local TV.
[00:10:30.549 --> 00:10:33.231]  It was WBAL-TV, Channel 11.
[00:10:34.392 --> 00:10:37.395]  The reporter there, Debra, she interviewed some of the gang members.
[00:10:37.435 --> 00:10:42.841]  I want to go to the first clip here, where they talk about how they were all, it was all mischaracterized, what happened.
[00:10:42.861 --> 00:10:44.202]  So take a look at this, Darren.
[00:10:44.222 --> 00:10:46.445]  You haven't seen this clip yet, and then I want to get your comments on it.
[00:10:46.765 --> 00:10:53.392]  That the image that they're trying to portray of the gangs in Baltimore, the BGF, the Bloods, the Crips, we did not make that truce.
[00:10:54.361 --> 00:10:55.523]  To harm cops.
[00:10:55.783 --> 00:10:57.605]  We did not come together against the cops.
[00:10:58.146 --> 00:11:00.068]  We're not about to allow y'all to paint this picture of us.
[00:11:00.349 --> 00:11:02.872]  They saying we animals and we acting like savages out here.
[00:11:03.373 --> 00:11:07.918]  But I also agree with what was... I don't agree with what's going on, but I understand what's going on.
[00:11:07.978 --> 00:11:08.940]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.362]  I understand why people mad.
[00:11:10.942 --> 00:11:12.383]  But we gotta handle things another way.
[00:11:12.703 --> 00:11:16.364]  We've been out here all day trying to stop, prevent people from breaking into stores.
[00:11:16.684 --> 00:11:22.466]  They hit us with a bomb, they burnt my shirt, they ripped it, and we were still standing right there as a whole.
[00:11:22.486 --> 00:11:28.267]  They heard it, but we came right back there, holding hands together, and we still, we marched together.
[00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:32.729]  So, right there you're getting a completely different picture from what the cops are saying.
[00:11:32.749 --> 00:11:35.270]  I got another clip to go to in a second, but what do you think of that right there?
[00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:39.191]  Just hearing those- Well, my first observation is that they'll tell you, okay,
[00:11:40.532 --> 00:11:42.252]  It's not on the mainstream television.
[00:11:42.272 --> 00:11:44.173]  That was on a local television station, right?
[00:11:44.193 --> 00:11:48.074]  They're not going to be playing that clip on Fox News or even on MSNBC.
[00:11:48.134 --> 00:11:51.014]  So that was a localized, local station there in Baltimore?
[00:11:51.215 --> 00:11:51.395]  Yeah.
[00:11:51.855 --> 00:11:52.095]  Okay.
[00:11:52.615 --> 00:12:00.937]  And it's the same thing, it reminds me of also another thing we're not seeing is there was plenty of black folks out there that were actually guarding the police.
[00:12:01.057 --> 00:12:01.797]  Have you seen pictures
[00:12:01.817 --> 00:12:02.898]  That's an article from Steve Watson today.
[00:12:23.717 --> 00:12:29.445]  But it's just amazing that, you know, people try to come together to stop their violence in their communities without police help.
[00:12:29.605 --> 00:12:31.047]  They're saying, we're going to take care of ourselves.
[00:12:31.067 --> 00:12:33.650]  We're going to clean up after ourselves what these other people have done.
[00:12:34.171 --> 00:12:37.275]  And it's being labeled as a credible threat to law enforcement.
[00:12:37.836 --> 00:12:38.937]  And it makes you wonder how much...
[00:12:40.419 --> 00:12:45.262]  They're responsible for maybe the gang problems or or just the mistrust between people.
[00:12:45.322 --> 00:12:51.426]  So I want to go to the second clip where they talk about a famous incident that was all over Twitter, all over Facebook.
[00:12:51.446 --> 00:12:52.267]  And that's the picture.
[00:12:52.327 --> 00:12:53.428]  I'm going to go to it right here.
[00:12:54.048 --> 00:12:59.372]  And it's this this guy and this and this these two guys squaring off against each other.
[00:12:59.732 --> 00:13:01.813]  And this is a iconic image.
[00:13:01.833 --> 00:13:04.755]  This is right outside the Orioles Stadium, right outside the bar.
[00:13:05.316 --> 00:13:09.939]  And the way it's being portrayed is that the black people started attacking the people at the bar.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.427]  And now there's a different story coming out.
[00:13:14.148 --> 00:13:17.396]  The City paper published a little bit different, but here's what they had to say.
[00:13:17.417 --> 00:13:19.000]  Here's what the young men that were there had to say.
[00:13:19.656 --> 00:13:23.277]  We are black men, and we are united, and we're not going to stop.
[00:13:23.337 --> 00:13:28.138]  No matter if y'all even keep on trying to say we're out here trying to shoot police, we're not trying to shoot police.
[00:13:28.358 --> 00:13:33.219]  We're not going to let that stop us from doing what we already originally planned to do.
[00:13:33.359 --> 00:13:36.220]  Stop believing everything you hear in the media.
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:42.201]  If you were not at that protest on the day that we protested for Freddie, you don't know what actually happened.
[00:13:43.044 --> 00:13:47.226]  They didn't tell y'all that when we walked past the eateries downtown that people threw beers at us.
[00:13:47.686 --> 00:13:49.227]  People called us names.
[00:13:49.567 --> 00:13:50.507]  You know, everything.
[00:13:51.147 --> 00:13:53.268]  To be blunt, they called us those things.
[00:13:53.308 --> 00:13:56.890]  The point that we're trying to get across is that we are of a different faction.
[00:13:57.577 --> 00:14:04.439]  And what that's going to do is start to show people in the community that we can come together as a unit and be unified and be peaceful.
[00:14:04.979 --> 00:14:16.221]  It was so much stuff that was going on on Saturday that got portrayed in the wrong direction or in the wrong light that for some reason, who knows, right, why they won't paint this picture in a positive way.
[00:14:16.602 --> 00:14:17.542]  Like when a group of 30 bloods
[00:14:18.729 --> 00:14:25.673]  So they're painting a completely different picture of that event and the way the cops are portraying them as coming together to come and take out cops.
[00:14:41.641 --> 00:14:43.202]  I mean, it's just, it's totally ridiculous.
[00:14:43.222 --> 00:14:47.045]  This City Paper writer, Brandon Soderbergh, said this.
[00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:14.563]  Well you're not going to hear about that because they want that picture to be seen.
[00:15:14.623 --> 00:15:16.264]  It's black versus white.
[00:15:16.304 --> 00:15:17.825]  They want a race war.
[00:15:17.865 --> 00:15:20.327]  And this justifies the police state.
[00:15:20.367 --> 00:15:28.813]  This basically, this way they have a reason to justify the expansion of federal powers into the police force and that's exactly what they're doing.
[00:15:28.833 --> 00:15:31.095]  We have to show them how to take control of a city.
[00:15:31.155 --> 00:15:32.376]  That's what they're trying to show.
[00:15:32.736 --> 00:15:35.438]  And this goes even more to the police credibility.
[00:15:35.798 --> 00:15:38.260]  I want to share with you guys a tweet that came out.
[00:15:39.505 --> 00:15:41.646]  This was 9.35 p.m.
[00:15:41.826 --> 00:15:42.086]  April 28, 2015.
[00:15:43.446 --> 00:15:44.087]  Baltimore Police.
[00:15:44.407 --> 00:15:49.108]  A group of criminals have just started a fire outside a library located at Pennsylvania Avenue and North Avenue.
[00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:57.231]  Less than nine minutes later, Jones-Swain writes, fire beside Pratt Library was not caused by Molotov cocktail.
[00:15:57.511 --> 00:16:01.053]  Tear gas grenade landed on trash and it sparked, set the fire.
[00:16:01.413 --> 00:16:03.113]  How many times have we seen tear gas start fires?
[00:16:03.133 --> 00:16:04.034]  Just go back to Waco.
[00:16:04.474 --> 00:16:07.775]  The tear gas there, burning up, burning people up.
[00:16:08.135 --> 00:16:08.956]  It's very dangerous.
[00:16:08.976 --> 00:16:14.099]  We saw that with the cop over in California when they pumped tear gas in there and they're saying burn it down, burn it down.
[00:16:14.119 --> 00:16:15.220]  Tear gas is flammable.
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.461]  These things are very flammable.
[00:16:16.841 --> 00:16:23.165]  So less than nine minutes later this reporter tweets that out and you know he says I'm a reporter and that's what he saw.
[00:16:23.426 --> 00:16:25.207]  But the cops portray it differently.
[00:16:25.467 --> 00:16:28.508]  Now, I want to go to an article from 2015, earlier this year.
[00:16:28.968 --> 00:16:32.749]  Baltimore drug probe crumbles after court challenge.
[00:16:33.289 --> 00:16:38.311]  And this, it talks about many cases, but one about Devin Leroy Jones.
[00:16:38.371 --> 00:16:45.033]  Prosecution crumbled when questions were raised in court about the inconsistencies in Lugio's search warrant application.
[00:16:45.153 --> 00:16:51.535]  After the detective acknowledged those inconsistencies, a federal judge expressed concern of the reckless disregard for the truth.
[00:16:51.795 --> 00:16:53.256]  That's a federal judge saying that.
[00:16:53.316 --> 00:17:01.200]  You can't get a federal judge to say anything on behalf of a defendant unless they're totally moral, totally on the up and up.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:05.143]  The next day, all the charges against Jones were dismissed and he was freed.
[00:17:06.103 --> 00:17:13.707]  Jones' case was listed in records that the Baltimore Sun requested from the city dealing with dozens of lawsuits filed against officers in 2013 and 2014.
[00:17:14.188 --> 00:17:16.249]  The request came after a Sun investigation.
[00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:32.033]  So maybe we should look at the Baltimore PD a little closer and going, you know, who's running your organization?
[00:17:32.354 --> 00:17:37.755]  Are you guys deliberately crumbling and becoming corrupt so you can be taken over by a federal police force?
[00:17:37.995 --> 00:17:40.596]  That's obviously the objective that the mayor has set.
[00:17:40.976 --> 00:17:41.176]  Yeah.
[00:17:41.556 --> 00:17:47.859]  So maybe we should stop looking at the locals who live there who are cleaning up after the other rioters.
[00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:50.240]  They're doing all these other cleanup actions.
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.941]  They're standing in front from Steve Watson.
[00:17:52.961 --> 00:17:59.384]  We got the pictures and footage you won't see on TV of the Baltimore citizens done with the mindless rioters.
[00:17:59.744 --> 00:18:01.345]  And that's what we have to see more.
[00:18:01.385 --> 00:18:04.547]  We have to see more of this type of news come out.
[00:18:05.507 --> 00:18:08.109]  Otherwise, the wrong picture is getting portrayed.
[00:18:08.129 --> 00:18:11.632]  The picture is becoming that we have to lock down these cities.
[00:18:11.672 --> 00:18:13.013]  We have to control these people.
[00:18:14.033 --> 00:18:16.575]  And here's another article from DC Clothesline.
[00:18:16.615 --> 00:18:20.458]  Twelve unanswered questions about the Baltimore riots they don't want us to ask.
[00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:25.762]  And it talks about the staged events with the riots, which we talked about, and how they were ordered to stand down.
[00:18:26.102 --> 00:18:27.764]  But I just want to go over a few of the questions.
[00:18:28.204 --> 00:18:33.608]  Why are dozens of social media accounts that were linked to violence in Ferguson are now trying to stir up violence in Baltimore?
[00:18:33.748 --> 00:18:34.469]  That's a good question.
[00:18:35.089 --> 00:18:42.712]  Who was behind the aggressive social media campaign to organize a purge that would start at the mall at precisely 3 p.m.
[00:18:42.732 --> 00:18:43.513]  on Monday afternoon.
[00:18:44.173 --> 00:18:52.877]  Even though authorities had credible intelligence, which they issued in that report, that gangs would be specifically targeting police officers on Monday, why weren't they more prepared?
[00:18:53.357 --> 00:18:55.537]  Okay, if they were expecting this, why weren't they beefed up?
[00:18:56.118 --> 00:19:02.799]  On Tuesday, the captain of the Baltimore Police tried to make us believe they weren't prepared because they were only anticipating a confrontation with high schoolers.
[00:19:04.179 --> 00:19:04.939]  Like in Ferguson.
[00:19:05.219 --> 00:19:05.639]  Exactly.
[00:19:05.859 --> 00:19:06.640]  And here's number five.
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:12.181]  Why are police officers in Baltimore claiming that they were instructed to stand down during the rioting on Monday afternoon?
[00:19:12.201 --> 00:19:13.761]  That's a big question.
[00:19:14.181 --> 00:19:17.242]  You know, why are these stand downs being ordered?
[00:19:17.342 --> 00:19:18.242]  I don't think it's just so
[00:19:19.222 --> 00:19:22.603]  Oh, we're going to let some people riot and get the anger out of their system.
[00:19:22.804 --> 00:19:26.905]  We don't let bank robbers go out and rob a couple banks to get it out of their system.
[00:19:27.205 --> 00:19:27.946]  Okay, it's wrong.
[00:19:28.286 --> 00:19:37.290]  They stood there and watched as buildings burned, as people's family shops burned to the ground, as all those police cars got burnt.
[00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:41.651]  And now they've imposed this curfew, which is going to really economically hit the area.
[00:19:41.731 --> 00:19:42.152]  Absolutely.
[00:19:42.232 --> 00:19:45.873]  Anything open after 10 o'clock is going to be decimated for an entire week.
[00:19:46.393 --> 00:19:46.934]  And who knows?
[00:19:48.414 --> 00:19:49.995]  What's going to happen in the aftermath?
[00:19:50.995 --> 00:19:53.076]  What forces are going to be left behind police-wise?
[00:19:53.196 --> 00:19:55.797]  How militarized is it going to stay there for a while?
[00:19:55.857 --> 00:19:59.458]  And then when this police report comes out Friday, is that going to answer any questions?
[00:20:00.018 --> 00:20:02.939]  And by the way, they're calling this a state of emergency.
[00:20:02.999 --> 00:20:10.302]  I thought it was interesting that the commander of the National Guard, she said that this is not martial law.
[00:20:11.222 --> 00:20:15.324]  We are going to be out in massive force and that just basically means that we are
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.822]  Going to be patrolling the streets and out to ensure that we're protecting property.
[00:20:19.882 --> 00:20:21.422]  We are in a supporting mode.
[00:20:21.902 --> 00:20:25.564]  So if there are any questions about martial law, this is not martial law.
[00:20:26.064 --> 00:20:29.425]  Martial law means that at that point, the military fully takes over.
[00:20:29.465 --> 00:20:31.066]  So we are not at that point.
[00:20:31.186 --> 00:20:32.506]  I repeat, not at that point.
[00:20:32.866 --> 00:20:36.868]  We are in support of the police department and we will be taking our direction
[00:20:37.392 --> 00:20:40.675]  From the police department as in where we're going to go out and support.
[00:20:40.895 --> 00:20:42.816]  So it's a state of emergency.
[00:20:43.337 --> 00:20:44.177]  It's not martial law.
[00:20:44.198 --> 00:20:45.038]  Definitely not martial law.
[00:20:45.158 --> 00:20:46.720]  I mean there's troops on the streets.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.302]  There's MRAPs and tanks and the National Guard.
[00:20:50.022 --> 00:20:50.763]  Locked and loaded.
[00:20:50.783 --> 00:20:51.583]  They got M4s.
[00:20:51.603 --> 00:20:52.584]  They got a curfew.
[00:20:52.924 --> 00:20:54.005]  The shops are closed.
[00:20:54.085 --> 00:20:55.907]  So it looks like martial law to me.
[00:20:56.127 --> 00:20:57.448]  But that doesn't mean martial law.
[00:20:57.609 --> 00:21:00.131]  It's just like when they say, we come in peace, and they start shooting.
[00:21:00.191 --> 00:21:02.694]  Oh, it's like an Orwellian term, state of emergency.
[00:21:02.774 --> 00:21:03.235]  I get you.
[00:21:03.535 --> 00:21:12.905]  Hey, by the way, InfoWars has boots on the ground in occupied Baltimore, Maryland right now as we take you to Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson.

[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:50.148]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running 6 miles every other day, swimming 2-3 miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights
[00:21:50.748 --> 00:21:51.549]  We're good to go.
[00:22:13.752 --> 00:22:16.394]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated.
[00:22:16.674 --> 00:22:18.235]  My muscle mass increased.
[00:22:18.436 --> 00:22:21.098]  My stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:22:21.398 --> 00:22:22.919]  Now is the time to take action.

[00:23:45.575 --> 00:23:47.316]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:23:47.396 --> 00:24:03.061]  I'm Darren McBrain along with Rob Doo and we just got contacted by Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs who are there in occupied Baltimore, Maryland and we're going to go to that Ustream right now and this is live so let's go check it out.
[00:24:04.661 --> 00:24:14.905]  Right now we have thousands of people marching down here from Pennsylvania Station all in protest of the Freddie Gray
[00:24:15.808 --> 00:24:19.430]  Killing that happened here in the custody of Baltimore police.
[00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:29.176]  Now what you can see all through here are tons of homies.
[00:24:30.317 --> 00:24:33.119]  Regular police always people are out here right now.
[00:24:35.845 --> 00:24:41.647]  As we come over this way, you'll see all the people coming in to this exact area.
[00:24:41.827 --> 00:24:51.369]  So far, we have been very welcomed for being down here.
[00:24:51.489 --> 00:24:56.391]  It's been a very peaceful day thus far.
[00:24:58.407 --> 00:25:01.569]  Thousands and thousands of people are now lined up in the street.
[00:25:01.629 --> 00:25:03.130]  They've been marching for 2.1 miles.
[00:25:33.914 --> 00:25:38.078]  It is a rampant problem that has been happening here in America.
[00:25:38.098 --> 00:25:40.380]  And quite frankly, we saw it in Ferguson.
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.201]  We're seeing it here.
[00:25:41.241 --> 00:25:45.825]  People are pissed off, and they want some kind of answer.
[00:25:45.865 --> 00:25:47.927]  They want some kind of justice.
[00:25:47.967 --> 00:25:50.889]  And what that's going to be, we don't know yet.
[00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:56.094]  So far, it hasn't been the justice that anybody wants.
[00:25:56.154 --> 00:25:58.916]  But we're going to be out here.
[00:26:09.429 --> 00:26:13.840]  Who's street?
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.742]  Our street!
[00:26:14.762 --> 00:26:15.644]  Who's street?
[00:26:15.724 --> 00:26:17.809]  Our street!
[00:26:22.529 --> 00:26:23.610]  This is our building.
[00:26:23.991 --> 00:26:25.212]  City Hall is ours.
[00:26:25.292 --> 00:26:27.234]  It belongs to the people.
[00:26:27.875 --> 00:26:30.117]  This city belongs to the people.
[00:26:30.157 --> 00:26:38.166]  We have an occupied force of law enforcement officers in our city, and we don't want you here.
[00:26:38.226 --> 00:26:41.770]  The people will take care of each other.
[00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:42.170]  Whose city?
[00:26:42.331 --> 00:26:43.172]  Our city!
[00:26:45.302 --> 00:26:49.185]  Wow, so it looks like the guys are about to embark on yet another great adventure.
[00:26:49.205 --> 00:26:50.385]  Should be interesting this evening.
[00:26:50.566 --> 00:26:56.149]  Right, it looks like there's a peaceful protest about to start there in the town hall area, the city hall area.
[00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:01.153]  And, you know, it's interesting the way we put people on the ground and they...
[00:27:02.513 --> 00:27:10.296]  There's a video out there now, I don't know if you've seen it yet, but Jakari and Joe run into a big, big, big InfoWars fan.
[00:27:10.736 --> 00:27:12.317]  He knows exactly who they are.
[00:27:12.377 --> 00:27:13.957]  He's really happy that they're there.
[00:27:14.778 --> 00:27:17.379]  Well-dressed guys, got a shirt and tie on.
[00:27:18.399 --> 00:27:22.082]  You know, happy to see non-mainstream media.
[00:27:22.242 --> 00:27:27.186]  And that goes back to the old muckraking, which you used to have with these big media outlets.
[00:27:27.206 --> 00:27:30.729]  You used to have guys who would go in there and really dig for real stories.
[00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:39.556]  And before we get off into this next report, I want to remind people you can go to UStream.tv forward slash Alex Jones live.
[00:27:40.296 --> 00:27:46.219]  And they're going to be filing live reports all night on that Ustream channel, ustream.tv forward slash Alex Jones Live.
[00:27:46.259 --> 00:27:46.980]  That's the one channel.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.802]  We have lots of channels on there, but that's the one they'll be using tonight.
[00:27:51.462 --> 00:27:53.503]  And I just think the Ustream thing is amazing.
[00:27:53.543 --> 00:27:55.104]  We've got, we've upped the quality on it.
[00:27:55.144 --> 00:27:57.085]  We've really taken it to the next level.
[00:27:57.125 --> 00:28:01.107]  We bought a really expensive piece of equipment that fits on top of that camera, a Teradek.
[00:28:01.648 --> 00:28:07.711]  And it's really, you know, given the guys a great tool to go out and capture that immediacy because that is where
[00:28:09.161 --> 00:28:09.941]  The news is going.
[00:28:10.082 --> 00:28:16.405]  It's going to that immediate event, catching it, putting it out to people, letting other people share it around.
[00:28:16.465 --> 00:28:17.646]  That is how news is.
[00:28:17.746 --> 00:28:18.627]  That is where it's going.
[00:28:18.827 --> 00:28:25.831]  When I used to go out a lot with Alex, it was funny, onto these events and stuff, we would shoot a ton of video and then we'd have to come back and edit it all.
[00:28:26.171 --> 00:28:27.412]  Now it's like that job doesn't...
[00:28:28.012 --> 00:28:31.355]  Almost need to be done anymore unless you really want to put a quality report together.
[00:28:31.816 --> 00:28:35.439]  But just being able to go out there and just kind of throw the media out.
[00:28:35.459 --> 00:28:37.361]  It's like throwing a bunch of stuff on the wall and seeing what it says.
[00:28:37.421 --> 00:28:40.444]  And the word's getting out because these guys are getting recognized.
[00:28:40.825 --> 00:28:44.568]  Last time, Jakari Jackson, they recognized him in a subway in New York.
[00:28:44.868 --> 00:28:46.130]  My God, it's Infowars!
[00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:55.453]  And locally here in Austin, we get the same thing, but the more we venture to other states where, you know, all of us are being recognized, which says a lot about this organization.
[00:28:55.513 --> 00:28:58.274]  It says a lot about just how we're getting the truth out.
[00:28:58.294 --> 00:28:58.935]  It's grassroots.
[00:28:58.955 --> 00:28:59.415]  It's awesome.
[00:28:59.435 --> 00:29:00.035]  It's grassroots.
[00:29:00.155 --> 00:29:07.478]  I remember going with Alex to New York when he was going to take on Piers Morgan, and a security guard and a baggage handler each recognized Alex.
[00:29:08.038 --> 00:29:09.979]  Thanks for coming to New York, Alex.
[00:29:10.099 --> 00:29:11.360]  Yeah, forget about Alex.
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.721]  He's everywhere.
[00:29:12.881 --> 00:29:18.004]  But it was almost like a fight club moment where they were like, thanks for coming, Alex.
[00:29:18.104 --> 00:29:19.165]  They knew why he was there.
[00:29:19.185 --> 00:29:20.225]  It's just amazing.
[00:29:20.265 --> 00:29:34.014]  But this goes back to this whole muckraking thing, where digging for real news, not just accepting what is being told us by this corporate-controlled, this big pharma-funded, this military-industrial complex-funded media that we have now, this rah-rah war machine.
[00:29:34.494 --> 00:29:37.656]  So, John Bounce put together a report on why muckraking will never die.
[00:29:38.157 --> 00:29:39.678]  At least, we hope it never dies.
[00:29:39.718 --> 00:29:42.660]  We hope it continues, and I think we're continuing that tradition here on InfoWars.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.881]  So, we're going to go to that report, and then we'll be back.
[00:29:45.001 --> 00:29:53.387]  I've got some great fluoride news, some good news on the fluoride front, and we're going to share with you another report from Alex Jones about humanity's secret destiny revealed.
[00:29:53.407 --> 00:29:54.128]  So, stay tuned for that.
[00:29:54.148 --> 00:29:54.748]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:04.932 --> 00:30:12.094]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:30:12.194 --> 00:30:14.354]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:30:14.554 --> 00:30:19.756]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:30:19.916 --> 00:30:24.997]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:30:25.157 --> 00:30:28.258]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:30:28.538 --> 00:30:32.459]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:30:32.659 --> 00:30:36.981]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:30:37.061 --> 00:30:47.164]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:30:47.404 --> 00:30:58.334]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:30:58.494 --> 00:31:02.498]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.

[00:32:16.411 --> 00:32:22.538]  On March 5th, 2014, Liz Wahl resigned from her job at RT during a live broadcast.
[00:32:22.798 --> 00:32:25.121]  After this newscast, I'm resigning.
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:37.287]  According to TruthDig.com, the entire incident was prior knowledge and supported by no less than James Kirchick, a fellow of the neocon think tank known as the Foreign Policy Initiative.
[00:32:37.587 --> 00:32:43.930]  Inside the offices of the Foreign Policy Initiative, a staffer logged onto the group's Twitter account to announce the following.
[00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:49.313]  Hashtag word on the street says that something big might happen on RT in about 20 to 25 minutes.
[00:32:50.774 --> 00:32:58.518]  Then at 5.16, exactly 10 minutes before Wahl would quit on-air, FPI tweeted, Up until 2 minutes before Wahl's resignation,
[00:33:07.123 --> 00:33:07.843]  F.P.I.
[00:33:08.183 --> 00:33:11.524]  took to Twitter again to urge its followers to tune in to RT.
[00:33:11.924 --> 00:33:14.305]  And finally, at 5.26 p.m.
[00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:16.885]  at the very moment Wahl quit, F.P.I.'
[00:33:16.845 --> 00:33:18.566]  's Twitter account broke the news.
[00:33:19.066 --> 00:33:20.886]  RT anchor resigns on air.
[00:33:21.086 --> 00:33:25.167]  She cannot be part of a network that whitewashes the actions of Putin.
[00:33:25.467 --> 00:33:26.988]  The tweets from F.P.I.
[00:33:27.048 --> 00:33:32.049]  suggested a direct level of coordination between Wahl and the neoconservative think tank.
[00:33:32.489 --> 00:33:37.071]  Just over an hour later, an exclusive interview with Wall appeared at the Daily Beast.
[00:33:37.351 --> 00:33:39.171]  It was authored by James Kirchick.
[00:33:39.391 --> 00:33:52.216]  Kirchick wrote that by quitting, Wall paid the price real reporters, not Russian government-funded propagandists, have to pay if they're concerned with quaint notions like objectivity and the truth.
[00:33:52.616 --> 00:33:58.418]  With the recent legalization of a no-holds-barred propaganda movement aimed at the American public,
[00:33:58.638 --> 00:34:01.899]  This is the Voice of America, Washington D.C.
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:02.920]  signing on.
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:13.204]  David Esnor was given the task of retrofitting the decrepit Voice of America and transforming it into a powerhouse 24-hour propaganda news network.
[00:34:13.544 --> 00:34:22.528]  When I was on your show two and a half years ago, three years ago, I used to tell you about the fact that we did the show, we shared a studio with Voice of America.
[00:34:23.328 --> 00:34:26.650]  They were having trouble competing with RT
[00:34:27.446 --> 00:34:28.447]  And press TV.
[00:34:28.527 --> 00:34:30.287]  And I was doing a show on both of those networks.
[00:34:31.308 --> 00:34:37.571]  And Voice of America was, you know, coming on to me saying, you got to work for Voice of America.
[00:34:37.631 --> 00:34:39.331]  Come on over to Voice of America.
[00:34:39.351 --> 00:34:42.313]  And I said, no, you know, you guys are just propaganda.
[00:34:42.613 --> 00:34:46.775]  And then the offers started to come in for money.
[00:34:47.655 --> 00:34:49.776]  The amounts of money started to get bigger.
[00:34:50.136 --> 00:34:52.878]  And I kept saying, no, no, you guys are propaganda.
[00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:53.718]  You don't get it.
[00:34:53.798 --> 00:34:54.378]  I do news.
[00:34:54.698 --> 00:34:55.739]  You guys are propaganda.
[00:34:56.829 --> 00:35:09.403]  And then, you know, I started hearing about these, our correspondents at RT being approached by Voice of America and these other folks like the Broadcasting Board of Governor folks.
[00:35:10.264 --> 00:35:13.267]  And then before you know it, this Liz Wall thing went down.
[00:35:13.849 --> 00:35:15.930]  I can only imagine the numbers they threw at her.
[00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:28.517]  Sure, did you see the RT reporter that you're talking about who did that whole stage thing that she quit testifying before Congress, we played it last week, saying basically get rid of free speech and that evil alternative media must be stopped?
[00:35:29.017 --> 00:35:30.098]  They asked me to do that.
[00:35:31.377 --> 00:35:33.639]  Wait a minute, you're breaking major news.
[00:35:33.879 --> 00:35:37.963]  You're saying you were approached to do a stage defection from RT.
[00:35:38.503 --> 00:35:41.185]  Yeah, and they would say, you know what, you should be a patriot.
[00:35:41.286 --> 00:35:43.087]  You shouldn't be doing RT or Press TV.
[00:35:43.107 --> 00:35:44.288]  You need to be doing Voice of America.
[00:35:44.328 --> 00:35:46.970]  I said, no, you guys are pure propaganda.
[00:35:47.151 --> 00:35:49.693]  Eventually, they found a weak link in the chain.
[00:35:49.753 --> 00:35:54.397]  Somebody to take money, ruin their career, flush their career down the toilet.
[00:35:55.146 --> 00:35:56.727]  And now she's scrambling.
[00:35:56.747 --> 00:36:04.351]  I know, these journalists like Armstrong Williams that people don't get, you sell out, you get caught, you've destroyed yourself.
[00:36:05.112 --> 00:36:09.974]  It's a real smack in the face to actual journalists who are dying out there doing real journalism.
[00:36:10.675 --> 00:36:14.537]  Michael Hastings, for example, who was killed by the Pentagon doing journalism.
[00:36:14.757 --> 00:36:20.781]  You know, in his memory, this Liz Wahl, you know, sells out to propagandists.
[00:36:21.401 --> 00:36:22.401]  It's sad.
[00:36:22.441 --> 00:36:23.222]  It's a sad day.
[00:36:23.826 --> 00:36:28.612]  Liz Wall got swept up in the arms of the slothful American propaganda movement.
[00:36:42.327 --> 00:36:44.668]  And feed off of each other's biases.
[00:36:45.568 --> 00:36:59.971]  It's almost like a community that is almost like a cult, I would say, that is formed online and they mobilize and they feel like they are part of some enlightened fight against the establishment.
[00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:06.612]  They find an outlet where they can, a platform to voice their deranged views.
[00:37:07.012 --> 00:37:09.173]  Mr. Lack, who has since departed,
[00:37:09.713 --> 00:37:19.418]  Had gotten a lot of criticism for comparing Russia today and Russian propaganda to ISIS propaganda.
[00:37:20.539 --> 00:37:28.643]  And while, yes, there is a strong difference, we're talking about a terrorist organization versus a government, you know, a nation state.
[00:37:29.103 --> 00:37:36.367]  I think he did have credence in comparing the strategy that's there by using the Internet
[00:37:36.727 --> 00:37:36.887]  I think?
[00:37:55.879 --> 00:38:11.792]  Where disinformation, false theories, people that are just trying to make a name for themselves, bloggers or whatever, that have absolutely no accountability for the truth, are able to rile up a mass amount of people online.
[00:38:12.052 --> 00:38:13.213]  In retrospect of Ms.
[00:38:13.253 --> 00:38:16.916]  Wall's testimony, let's make something abundantly clear.
[00:38:17.256 --> 00:38:25.203]  Bloggers, journalists, and regular citizens pointing out faults in the overreaching power grab by government and corporations is nothing
[00:38:25.743 --> 00:38:43.448]  New, Ida Tarbell, one of the founders of the muckraking movement and the creator of investigative journalism, started the snowball back in 1900 when she went after the seemingly untouchable Rockefellers and Standard Oil, using irrefutable documents to back up all of her claims.
[00:38:43.928 --> 00:38:47.089]  No different than what you see here at InfoWars today.
[00:38:47.409 --> 00:38:52.091]  So call us a cult, call us conspiracy theorists, but make no mistake, Ms.
[00:38:52.131 --> 00:38:53.671]  Wall, we know what you are.
[00:38:53.971 --> 00:38:57.974]  And you don't even have the journalistic integrity required to sharpen Ms.
[00:38:57.994 --> 00:38:59.034]  Tarbell's pencil.
[00:39:08.666 --> 00:39:14.791]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:39:14.812 --> 00:39:18.154]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:39:18.235 --> 00:39:19.856]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:39:19.896 --> 00:39:26.142]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:39:26.262 --> 00:39:32.147]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:39:32.307 --> 00:39:36.049]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:39:36.249 --> 00:39:39.151]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:39:39.331 --> 00:39:47.316]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:39:47.616 --> 00:39:49.657]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:39:49.697 --> 00:39:50.758]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:39:51.098 --> 00:39:59.841]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[00:40:14.281 --> 00:40:24.809]  Alright, so I understand we have good news for the future of our nation's children as the government has finally decided to at least lower the fluoride levels somewhat, what, by half I take it?
[00:40:25.049 --> 00:40:25.770]  Is that good news?
[00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:26.351]  Or I mean...
[00:40:27.099 --> 00:40:28.260]  I guess we'll take what we can get.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.641]  It's not quite half, but it's getting better.
[00:40:30.682 --> 00:40:32.042]  It's getting better than what it was.
[00:40:32.783 --> 00:40:33.704]  This came out today.
[00:40:33.784 --> 00:40:35.905]  We posted it, well, it came out April 27th.
[00:40:36.065 --> 00:40:36.305]  U.S.
[00:40:36.365 --> 00:40:39.588]  lowers fluoride levels in drinking water for first time in over 50 years.
[00:40:39.648 --> 00:40:41.709]  We posted it off the Associated Press.
[00:40:42.149 --> 00:40:43.610]  Link's back to a Guardian article.
[00:40:44.851 --> 00:41:02.266]  And in 1962 the government had been advising water systems to add fluoride to a level of 0.7 parts per million for warmer climates because people drink more water and they've recognized that you're putting more fluoride into your body and that's not necessarily a good thing in warmer climates where it was 1.2 parts per million in cooler areas.
[00:41:02.686 --> 00:41:04.928]  The new standard is now 0.7 everywhere.
[00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:07.931]  So we didn't get our fluoride lowered at all.
[00:41:07.971 --> 00:41:08.551]  That's what they
[00:41:09.272 --> 00:41:11.173]  That's what they keep it at, sorry to say.
[00:41:11.633 --> 00:41:13.214]  But it's getting better.
[00:41:13.554 --> 00:41:16.716]  And guys, roll some of this footage of what I shot.
[00:41:16.736 --> 00:41:20.618]  I actually shot this with a hidden camera at a fluoride treatment plant, a water treatment plant.
[00:41:20.658 --> 00:41:24.080]  I keep calling it a fluoride treatment plant because they are treating our water with fluoride.
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.341]  It's totally disgusting.
[00:41:26.141 --> 00:41:34.045]  Okay, so here is, this is one's over by Redbud Isle, this fluoride treatment plant, this water treatment plant where they do millions of gallons of water.
[00:41:34.626 --> 00:41:37.827]  This was all done, a camera being held by my side.
[00:41:38.228 --> 00:41:45.471]  And here is the area where they actually hook up, these fluoride vehicles show up in giant tankers and they hook up the fluoride right there.
[00:41:45.812 --> 00:41:51.775]  And if you notice, look at the area below, you can see it's kind of powdery, the concrete there, you can see where it stains it.
[00:41:51.935 --> 00:41:53.856]  And really, I mean, that's, it's destroying the
[00:41:54.056 --> 00:41:57.879]  Well, we'll see what would happen if they were to spill that stuff, because wasn't it in Minneapolis or somewhere?
[00:41:57.899 --> 00:41:59.600]  Well, imagine what this is doing to the inside of your body.
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:00.140]  That's horrible.
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:06.585]  Okay, and now you can see where the fluoride's all going, and it goes to a separate room, completely separate from the rest of the facility.
[00:42:07.125 --> 00:42:12.289]  Okay, and here it goes back to this room back here, and you can see on the door, it's got an MSDS rating.
[00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:13.050]  I'm going to pan up here.
[00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:16.632]  Three, okay, which is really bad for humans, but it's not the worst.
[00:42:16.812 --> 00:42:17.613]  Four is the worst.
[00:42:17.893 --> 00:42:18.153]  OK.
[00:42:18.493 --> 00:42:20.374]  But watch what happens when we go inside.
[00:42:20.414 --> 00:42:22.994]  You can see where they keep it in these big plastic tanks.
[00:42:23.014 --> 00:42:24.315]  There it says, do not drink the water.
[00:42:24.335 --> 00:42:25.255]  I thought that was kind of funny.
[00:42:26.455 --> 00:42:27.095]  There we are.
[00:42:27.115 --> 00:42:29.176]  We see the purple tubes running again.
[00:42:29.436 --> 00:42:30.076]  But look behind her.
[00:42:30.116 --> 00:42:31.897]  You can see it's the MSDS of four.
[00:42:32.197 --> 00:42:34.817]  And it says hydrofluorosilic acid on the side.
[00:42:34.837 --> 00:42:35.157]  There it is.
[00:42:35.177 --> 00:42:35.598]  Four.
[00:42:35.838 --> 00:42:36.898]  That is the worst
[00:42:38.087 --> 00:42:40.388]  MSDS rating for human reactivity.
[00:42:40.909 --> 00:42:43.450]  Okay, it will cause death if you're in there.
[00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:46.031]  That's why they keep this stuff all by itself.
[00:42:46.311 --> 00:42:53.695]  If these tanks were to be ruptured or explode, it would then collect in that bricked in area, but it would probably leak out and be an environmental hazard.
[00:42:54.135 --> 00:42:54.996]  Okay, but there you see it.
[00:42:55.496 --> 00:42:57.037]  MSDS of four.
[00:42:57.257 --> 00:43:00.999]  And they're doing all this because they're concerned about our teeth.
[00:43:01.539 --> 00:43:13.384]  Yeah, they put nine gallons an hour into the water supply there, nine gallons of this fluoride, this toxic waste byproduct that they get from phosphate fertilizer companies, and they put that in our water.
[00:43:13.904 --> 00:43:16.245]  Truly, truly, truly disgusting.
[00:43:16.325 --> 00:43:21.667]  Now, it says in this article, back at the Guardian article, 75% of Americans get fluoridated water.
[00:43:21.687 --> 00:43:21.947]  Yay!
[00:43:23.621 --> 00:43:28.124]  The change announced Monday finalizes a proposal first made four years ago.
[00:43:28.144 --> 00:43:31.727]  Hey, real quick, what's that compared to Europe, for example?
[00:43:31.767 --> 00:43:32.988]  It's a lot lower in Europe.
[00:43:33.028 --> 00:43:35.350]  There's not too many people that do it in Europe anymore.
[00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:38.052]  They've decided that it's not good for you.
[00:43:38.112 --> 00:43:40.334]  They're a lot ahead of us in some ways.
[00:43:40.894 --> 00:43:44.615]  But I think socially, they're into this big socialism thing.
[00:43:44.655 --> 00:43:47.756]  But for some reason, they're not into fluoride, which is interesting that we are.
[00:43:48.236 --> 00:43:52.597]  The government spent years sorting through and responding to the 19,000 public comments.
[00:43:52.637 --> 00:44:02.360]  So four years, 19,000 comments later, they lower the ratings for the people in northern climates, and that's to get them evened out.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:07.642]  But they still say too much fluoride is a common cause of white splotches and streaks on your teeth.
[00:44:07.803 --> 00:44:09.744]  I've got those streaks on my teeth.
[00:44:09.844 --> 00:44:12.345]  I was drinking fluoridated water when I was a kid.
[00:44:12.785 --> 00:44:15.527]  Out of the tap, out of the garden hose, just drinking water.
[00:44:16.607 --> 00:44:19.389]  So I have what they call fluorosis.
[00:44:20.583 --> 00:44:24.466]  Now fluoride causes all kinds of other problems other than white splotches on the teeth.
[00:44:24.486 --> 00:44:26.247]  They want you to think it's just white splotches.
[00:44:26.267 --> 00:44:27.368]  It's not for white splotches.
[00:44:27.828 --> 00:44:29.709]  Here's a report David Knight put together.
[00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:32.991]  Fat, stupid, and depressed fluoride side effects.
[00:44:33.032 --> 00:44:34.713]  He put this out February 25th.
[00:44:35.133 --> 00:44:41.097]  It also has thyroid disorders, obesity, depression, there's other diseases, loss of IQ.
[00:44:41.437 --> 00:44:43.479]  I have a graphic right here that shows
[00:44:45.021 --> 00:44:48.422]  The different news outlets that reported that fluoride causes cancer.
[00:44:48.962 --> 00:44:52.543]  Okay, and they know this, yet they still put it in our drinking water.
[00:44:52.563 --> 00:44:52.883]  Harvard Studies.
[00:44:53.003 --> 00:44:54.103]  Yeah, they still put it in there.
[00:44:54.643 --> 00:44:59.264]  So, that I want people to also go check this video out.
[00:44:59.284 --> 00:45:00.905]  This is a video we put out a few years ago in 2010.
[00:45:01.905 --> 00:45:07.046]  Professor Paul Conant, we put out this, it's nearly an hour, talking about fluoride.
[00:45:07.106 --> 00:45:09.987]  If you really want to get all the information on fluoride, go watch this video.
[00:45:10.687 --> 00:45:18.732]  59 minutes, it's got 152,000 views, it's on our sister channel, The Info Warrior, and it's Professor Paul Conant, your toxic tap water.
[00:45:19.333 --> 00:45:31.540]  And today, remember Alex had Mr. Dave Breckler on the show, Mr. Vitamin, kind of the guy behind the big vitamin industry going on here, and the high quality vitamins, not the low quality vitamins that you get in... The natural vitamins.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:32.241]  Exactly.
[00:45:32.261 --> 00:45:33.161]  Big difference.
[00:45:33.301 --> 00:45:38.485]  Anyway, we had, we did a special presentation that we just put together today after he was on Alex's show.
[00:45:39.305 --> 00:45:39.645]  We're good.
[00:45:59.457 --> 00:46:00.238]  That's right.
[00:46:00.258 --> 00:46:00.879]  That's what we do.
[00:46:17.538 --> 00:46:19.379]  Hi, this is Dave Breckler, The Vitamin Guy.
[00:46:19.899 --> 00:46:22.220]  I've been in the vitamin industry for over 20 years.
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:37.146]  I work with most of the major manufacturers, and we've been selling vitamins into all the major outlets in America and overseas now, and we're consulting InfoWars on their product selection and the quality of their products.
[00:46:37.466 --> 00:46:42.391]  I've been on InfoWars radio program today and I wanted to come back and talk about a couple of the subjects we touched today.
[00:46:43.432 --> 00:46:47.276]  We talked a little bit about how Big Pharma got started originally.
[00:46:47.396 --> 00:46:55.084]  At the turn of the century, there was allopathic medicine, homeopathic medicine, and there was also osteopathic medicine.
[00:46:55.464 --> 00:46:59.888]  But some of the big money people, like the Carnegie family, went around the country and
[00:47:00.609 --> 00:47:07.835]  Organized all the doctors that were practicing allopathic medicine and ended up going getting just allopathic medicine for the country.
[00:47:08.336 --> 00:47:12.139]  So they've successfully repressed most of the alternative medicines.
[00:47:12.619 --> 00:47:14.801]  They've come out mostly with allopathic medicine.
[00:47:15.121 --> 00:47:20.126]  They built the medical schools and they funded all the drug research and the drug Big Pharma.
[00:47:20.686 --> 00:47:24.769]  So now we're stuck with the result of that, which is big pharma medications for most people.
[00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:28.212]  And today on the show, we talked about the flu vaccine.
[00:47:28.652 --> 00:47:32.716]  And I have now the printout from the flu vaccine from Fluval.
[00:47:33.256 --> 00:47:37.599]  And this is the actual insert that they put inside of the flu vaccine.
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.261]  And I'll quote right from here.
[00:47:39.721 --> 00:47:43.164]  It says, there have been no controlled trials.
[00:47:43.524 --> 00:47:43.804]  I think?
[00:48:00.461 --> 00:48:16.051]  We've been telling everybody today, you have to take responsibility for your own health, you have to stay healthy, you have to eat good food, drink pure water, get exercise, take your supplements, take charge of your own health, because you can't expect Big Pharma or your doctor to do it for you.
[00:48:16.311 --> 00:48:16.851]  Thank you, Dave.
[00:48:45.734 --> 00:48:47.295]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:48:47.715 --> 00:48:53.780]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:08.530]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running 6 miles every other day, swimming 2-3 miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights
[00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:09.931]  We're good to go.
[00:49:32.128 --> 00:49:34.811]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated.
[00:49:35.031 --> 00:49:36.633]  My muscle mass increased.
[00:49:36.813 --> 00:49:39.475]  My stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:49:39.776 --> 00:49:41.297]  Now is the time to take action.

[00:51:04.185 --> 00:51:05.946]  We're back and I guess we have another video.
[00:51:05.966 --> 00:51:12.089]  This one is from Alex Jones earlier today and this is a little bit of a different look, kind of a positive look.
[00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:13.530]  He mentioned that today on the radio.
[00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:18.133]  He said he wants to start doing more positive messages and I know this is something he harps on a lot.
[00:51:18.173 --> 00:51:21.655]  He wants us to do more positive stuff because we do cover a lot of
[00:51:22.455 --> 00:51:23.436]  Negative things that are going on.
[00:51:23.456 --> 00:51:25.638]  Doom and gloom and a lot of stuff that's deep in the rabbit hole.
[00:51:25.658 --> 00:51:26.778]  Those things aren't being covered.
[00:51:26.818 --> 00:51:27.699]  That's why we cover them.
[00:51:27.939 --> 00:51:31.962]  But he wants to start doing more positive stuff and he's encouraging us to do more positive stuff.
[00:51:32.783 --> 00:51:36.065]  I try to point out funny ways people protest things.
[00:51:36.125 --> 00:51:38.948]  I did one on the Common Core homework.
[00:51:39.748 --> 00:51:47.592]  Weeks ago when this lady wrote a note on the child's homework and said, don't send this crap home to us anymore about vaccines or, you know, whatever they were teaching at that time.
[00:51:47.612 --> 00:51:48.072]  But here's one.
[00:51:48.412 --> 00:51:50.613]  It's called Humanity's Secret Destiny Revealed.
[00:51:50.914 --> 00:51:51.934]  We just put it up today.
[00:51:51.954 --> 00:51:53.895]  And I'm just going to read about it.
[00:51:53.995 --> 00:51:59.058]  Alex Jones reveals the secret to stepping outside the box and releasing humanity's true potential.
[00:51:59.238 --> 00:52:05.601]  As the globalist and social engineers attempt to shutter our minds and stifle our creativity, it is up to us to break the chains of collectivism.
[00:52:06.081 --> 00:52:07.943]  And take humanity to the next level.
[00:52:08.263 --> 00:52:09.545]  And that's what we're doing here, right?
[00:52:09.645 --> 00:52:18.434]  I mean, people buying Prison Planet TV memberships help us take humanity to the next level where we can put out more positive information, more empowering information.
[00:52:18.715 --> 00:52:19.155]  That's right.
[00:52:19.275 --> 00:52:19.576]  You know?
[00:52:19.736 --> 00:52:21.298]  I mean, that's what it's all about for me.
[00:52:21.778 --> 00:52:21.958]  Yeah.
[00:52:22.278 --> 00:52:32.747]  And by the way, if you're watching this, if you happen to catch this video on YouTube, we're like, what, 2,000 subscriptions close now to 1 million subscribers.
[00:52:32.788 --> 00:52:34.469]  Yeah, we've almost hit that milestone.
[00:52:34.529 --> 00:52:35.690]  Everybody's talking about it.
[00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:41.735]  I've been watching it rise up steadily since I first got here and started really putting up a lot of videos on YouTube.
[00:52:42.416 --> 00:52:44.818]  And I mean, it's just amazing the amount of videos.
[00:52:45.078 --> 00:52:45.659]  It's obscene.
[00:52:45.739 --> 00:52:48.061]  We're into billions of minutes watched.
[00:52:48.681 --> 00:52:53.866]  I mean, I can't even fathom how big and how important that YouTube channel is.
[00:52:53.926 --> 00:52:54.767]  And that's just one of them.
[00:52:54.807 --> 00:52:58.211]  We have other YouTube channels which have longer videos on them.
[00:52:58.551 --> 00:53:04.557]  Before we got the Director's Count on that one, we had a Director's Count on the Info Warrior, and so we have a lot of big stuff there.
[00:53:04.917 --> 00:53:06.459]  So, you know, get out there.
[00:53:06.479 --> 00:53:08.541]  Become subscribers to those channels.
[00:53:08.841 --> 00:53:10.783]  Become a subscriber to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:11.644 --> 00:53:12.884]  That's a great way to help us.
[00:53:12.964 --> 00:53:14.205]  It's $5.95 a month.
[00:53:14.225 --> 00:53:17.406]  You can share your username and password with up to 20 people.
[00:53:17.506 --> 00:53:17.886]  That's right.
[00:53:17.906 --> 00:53:20.147]  So that's 20 InfoWarriors for the price of one.
[00:53:20.547 --> 00:53:25.488]  And with that, I guess we're going to go to Alex's message, Humanity's Secret Destiny Revealed.
[00:53:25.628 --> 00:53:28.549]  And Darren, this is a good little co-hosting bit we did here.
[00:53:28.569 --> 00:53:28.929]  Yeah, it was fun.
[00:53:28.989 --> 00:53:29.610]  It was a lot of fun.
[00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:30.010]  We'll do it again.
[00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:33.931]  Maybe we'll start doing these a few more, maybe a couple times a month we'll get on here and do this.
[00:53:34.431 --> 00:53:37.292]  So thanks for joining us on this edition of the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:53:37.312 --> 00:53:38.873]  I'm co-host Rob Dew.
[00:53:39.433 --> 00:53:40.213]  I'm Darren McBrain.
[00:53:40.353 --> 00:53:41.834]  And we'll see you next time, 7 p.m.
[00:53:41.854 --> 00:53:42.154]  Central.
[00:53:42.414 --> 00:53:42.634]  Right.
[00:53:50.437 --> 00:54:03.722]  Have you ever just paused for a moment and turned off the television and put away People Magazine to look around you and realize where we are on this beautiful planet, hurtling through space, orbiting the sun, out on the edge of a spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy?
[00:54:05.509 --> 00:54:27.459]  Because that simple thought, that simple moment of pulling back and getting outside the box, of coming out of the cave into the wider world, has helped me and many others realize how pathetic the global social engineers really are, who would attempt to shutter the psyches, the minds, the creativity of the people even more.
[00:54:28.496 --> 00:54:40.362]  I look at the messages put out by Hollywood and mainstream media about how ugly we are, about how dumb we are, about how bad we are, how we're a disease on the face of the world, and how we've got to be exterminated.
[00:54:40.962 --> 00:54:48.626]  That's a bunch of greedy, hateful, control freaks who are envious of beautiful and smart people.
[00:54:49.659 --> 00:54:56.123]  Who wish to set themselves up as gods in some type of high-tech nightmare world.
[00:54:56.964 --> 00:55:01.547]  I'm here as a 21st century Paul Revere telling you I believe in you.
[00:55:01.967 --> 00:55:12.134]  But beyond believing in you at a cellular level, I know how powerful you are when you realize the true destiny of humanity.
[00:55:12.714 --> 00:55:14.796]  And when you understand that you are the heirs
[00:55:16.932 --> 00:55:24.658]  Of all the humans that came before us that did incredible things to bring us to this point.
[00:55:25.279 --> 00:55:28.241]  They say necessity is the mother of invention.
[00:55:28.381 --> 00:55:31.344]  We have the necessity to defeat the new world order.
[00:55:31.524 --> 00:55:36.828]  The globalists, the eugenicists, the social engineers that are waging war on our people worldwide.
[00:55:38.049 --> 00:55:46.957]  Whether you are old, young, and no matter what color your skin is, we are all brothers and sisters in this human quest going back tens of thousands of years.
[00:55:47.778 --> 00:55:59.208]  I don't want us to fail now because a small group of predators learned how we worked and then launched a war against their own species so they could greedily control the entire future destiny.
[00:56:00.072 --> 00:56:14.163]  I want the compendium, the great mass of humanity with our ideas and with our competition and with our loves and passions to decide the future in an open, free society.
[00:56:14.784 --> 00:56:20.729]  Not one based on lies, not one based on fraud, but based on love of humanity and free will.
[00:56:21.986 --> 00:56:22.708]  You have the power.
[00:56:23.209 --> 00:56:24.492]  You are incredible creatures.
[00:56:24.934 --> 00:56:30.147]  You are the heirs of this amazing genetic treasure trove of struggle.
[00:56:30.939 --> 00:56:38.181]  Let's not just let humanity survive, let's build on what we've already done and make our ancestors proud.
[00:56:38.741 --> 00:56:41.602]  Because they are watching today, they are inside of us.
[00:56:42.102 --> 00:56:50.064]  Every cell, every genetic memory, we are all those that came before us and we will live forever through our progeny into the future.
[00:56:50.504 --> 00:56:57.626]  But make no mistake, there's an epic war, an incredible battle over the future of our species happening right now.
[00:56:58.786 --> 00:57:00.267]  You don't want to sit on the sidelines.
[00:57:00.728 --> 00:57:02.309]  You don't want to sit in the middle of the road.
[00:57:02.849 --> 00:57:04.751]  You want to choose sides wisely.
[00:57:10.498 --> 00:57:17.463]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.
