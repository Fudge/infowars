[00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.591]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.591 --> 00:00:08.352]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.352 --> 00:00:10.113]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.113 --> 00:00:11.693]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.693 --> 00:00:13.234]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:17.436]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.436 --> 00:00:21.479]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:44.318]  Four years ago, when the West, backed by NATO, went into Libya, overthrew it, and turned the country over to Al-Qaeda and Saudi Arabian-backed groups, we predicted we'd start seeing jihad attacks in the West, threats to shoot down jetliners with these stolen Stinger missiles, and more.
[00:00:44.318 --> 00:00:49.742]  What I didn't expect with the Wahhabist, globalist, shadow armies,
[00:00:51.107 --> 00:01:06.612]  Was for them to then have them lead giant exoduses out of North Africa, the Middle East, and other areas in through Turkey, who then shuttles everyone to the borders of Eastern and Western Europe.
[00:01:06.612 --> 00:01:10.913]  I mean, that is so bold!
[00:01:10.913 --> 00:01:18.015]  And then to have the media with a straight face in unison from the UK to Germany to France to Sweden to Canada to the US to say,
[00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:22.557]  It's our job to take millions of people.
[00:01:22.557 --> 00:01:25.038]  It's your job to pay for it.
[00:01:25.038 --> 00:01:27.398]  The West is evil.
[00:01:27.398 --> 00:01:31.060]  We need to pay for everything.
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.101]  And then Donald Trump comes out two days ago and says, yeah, we got to take them.
[00:01:36.101 --> 00:01:37.541]  Merkel's doing a great job.
[00:01:37.541 --> 00:01:40.082]  He's since backpedaled.
[00:01:40.082 --> 00:01:42.743]  And we have that video.
[00:01:44.172 --> 00:01:46.079]  That we're going to be playing here.
[00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.150]  In fact, I know you gave it to me, but can I have another video list?
[00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.214]  I can't find it.
[00:01:50.214 --> 00:01:50.535]  Thank you.
[00:01:52.065 --> 00:01:56.166]  And that ties into this story that's the top story on InfoWars.com.
[00:01:56.166 --> 00:02:01.208]  Hashtag winning 50 spies go public.
[00:02:01.208 --> 00:02:04.029]  Blow the whistle and report on ISIS.
[00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:10.791]  They say that ISIS is being basically protected, that the reports are being altered by higher-ups.
[00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:16.773]  They're fixing the intelligence to claim that ISIS isn't spreading or that ISIS isn't run by the West.
[00:02:19.412 --> 00:02:20.152]  Absolutely.
[00:02:20.152 --> 00:02:37.256]  ISIS is run by the West and Julian Assange has now put out the documents, which I wish he'd done years ago, that before the Arab Spring was launched by the West and by the Obama administration, to put radical Islamists in everywhere and then flood Europe.
[00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:39.257]  We now see the full master plan.
[00:02:43.376 --> 00:02:50.199]  That if you go back, they were planning to topple Assad using Al-Qaeda grips even before that.
[00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:52.180]  And that has now been released by WikiLeaks.
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:04.385]  I mean, you can just see the full garment now, the full cut of it, and it's now on the runway, fully animated, we now see their full plan.
[00:03:04.385 --> 00:03:09.848]  Truly, diabolical, beyond a James Bond movie, and all admitted
[00:03:11.186 --> 00:03:19.069]  But the public is so unconscionably politically, economically, culturally illiterate.
[00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.670]  We have no culture.
[00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.491]  Boy, they sure got us on the hook with John Wayne and I Love Lucy and stuff like that.
[00:03:26.491 --> 00:03:33.034]  And then once we had the, you know, public on the hook, we were going down the rat hole.
[00:03:33.034 --> 00:03:37.195]  Because once that unfolded, it was basically over.
[00:03:37.195 --> 00:03:38.856]  The sky was the limit.
[00:03:40.396 --> 00:03:42.657]  Once the hook was in our mouth.
[00:03:42.657 --> 00:03:49.599]  Sure, a worm's big and juicy and nutritious if you're a bass or a perch or a catfish.
[00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:59.843]  But once you bite into that worm, you find out there's cold hard steel, a big barb on the end, and it goes right through your lip, right underneath your jaw, and you're caught.
[00:03:59.843 --> 00:04:05.065]  And then you're hauled up into a whole nother atmosphere, a whole nother world.
[00:04:05.065 --> 00:04:06.225]  And you're on the dinner table.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:17.647]  And I look at the public raised by television, didn't have parents that were into geopolitics, didn't have parents into history, didn't have parents that took them places and educated them.
[00:04:17.647 --> 00:04:18.847]  They have no culture.
[00:04:18.847 --> 00:04:22.630]  These are empty, hollow men and women.
[00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:30.996]  And into that emptiness they now pour total racism, everyone hating each other, attacks on language as if language is evil itself.
[00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:39.315]  Just total cult Ing Sock 1984 over-the-top brainwashing.
[00:04:39.315 --> 00:04:41.797]  Except 1984 is a book.
[00:04:41.797 --> 00:04:45.099]  This is real.
[00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.540]  I mean, it is so diabolical.
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.303]  And the globalists will keep doing it as long as they think they're immune from justice.
[00:04:53.303 --> 00:04:55.825]  No one is immune from justice.
[00:04:59.412 --> 00:05:03.374]  ISIS has demanded that Syrian Christians pay an Islam tax.
[00:05:03.374 --> 00:05:06.315]  This is being reported by WorldNetDaily.
[00:05:06.315 --> 00:05:18.840]  ISIS terrorists gathered together dozens of Christian men in Syria and told them either to pay a Sharia-inspired tax and sign onto a list of faith-based restrictions or pay a penalty that could include the loss of life.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:26.863]  Among the restrictions, Christians cannot own guns, build places of worship, show their crosses in public or even ring church bells.
[00:05:27.563 --> 00:05:35.750]  The terrorists put forth their demands to Christians in a town that used to be dominated by the Christian faith, but has been taken over by radical Muslims.
[00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:43.217]  And while many followers of Islam will condemn these actions, numerous people in power continue to fund groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[00:05:43.937 --> 00:05:53.950]  Whether it's airdropping grenades or leaving behind billions of dollars worth of vehicles that they can use against us, these terrorist groups always seem to find the best equipment somewhere.
[00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.474]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[00:06:59.145 --> 00:07:00.406]  Another major health threat.
[00:07:00.406 --> 00:07:05.390]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.071]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:07:08.071 --> 00:07:15.096]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:07:15.096 --> 00:07:18.098]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:07:18.098 --> 00:07:21.041]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:23.062]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:07:23.062 --> 00:07:25.904]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:07:25.964 --> 00:07:31.706]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:07:31.706 --> 00:07:35.207]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:07:35.207 --> 00:07:38.308]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[00:07:56.574 --> 00:08:16.867]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.562 --> 00:08:33.645]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[00:08:33.645 --> 00:08:34.306]  to 2 p.m.
[00:08:34.306 --> 00:08:39.169]  Central, we're here live, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:56.762]  There's a big article in Politico today, breaking down the metrics from a bunch of different ratings systems, including Google, that Matt Drudge's DrudgeReport.com is the number one news and political website in the world.
[00:08:58.064 --> 00:09:11.093]  Even ahead of Facebook.com and all of its billions, more than two billion people regularly use Facebook, but it's all atomized, it's all fractured.
[00:09:11.093 --> 00:09:24.503]  I mean, we're able to reach three million people a day on Facebook with our eight different Facebook platforms that volunteers made for us six, seven years ago, whenever it first came out and then handed over to us.
[00:09:24.503 --> 00:09:25.544]  But imagine
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:40.045]  Being the number one news destination, political destination in the world, even bigger than Facebook.
[00:09:40.045 --> 00:09:47.028]  Matt Drudge, Mark Zuckerberg, Drudge Report editor, Facebook CEO.
[00:09:47.028 --> 00:09:54.111]  And it just goes into the fact that, basically, Drudge is continuing to expand his domination.
[00:09:54.111 --> 00:09:57.012]  They don't even count his Twitter accounts or other things he does.
[00:09:59.278 --> 00:10:08.802]  Now you notice, though, if you listen to people at Media Matters run by the White House that almost has no viewers and readers.
[00:10:08.802 --> 00:10:14.984]  But it doesn't matter because then the entire controlled media picks up their talking points and regurgitates it.
[00:10:14.984 --> 00:10:22.787]  So yeah, some talking point that the globalists email down doesn't itself on the printout have a big audience.
[00:10:22.787 --> 00:10:27.149]  But once it's put out there to be regurgitated and repeated, it is important.
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.042]  They, of course, are running around saying Matt Drudge has no viewers.
[00:10:33.042 --> 00:10:34.563]  Matt Drudge is dead.
[00:10:34.563 --> 00:10:36.604]  Matt Drudge has lost his importance.
[00:10:36.604 --> 00:10:38.806]  Matt Drudge is over.
[00:10:38.806 --> 00:10:45.009]  And this is a tactic that I see out of dinosaur media against us every day.
[00:10:45.009 --> 00:10:46.070]  Alex is a kook.
[00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.711]  Infowars is stupid.
[00:10:47.711 --> 00:10:48.711]  Nobody reads it.
[00:10:48.711 --> 00:10:49.692]  Nobody likes it.
[00:10:49.692 --> 00:10:50.793]  It's all over.
[00:10:50.793 --> 00:10:52.534]  They don't have any success.
[00:10:52.534 --> 00:10:54.655]  Ha ha ha.
[00:10:54.655 --> 00:10:55.976]  This is the tactics
[00:10:57.972 --> 00:11:01.855]  of a dying system.
[00:11:01.855 --> 00:11:08.120]  Our readership, our viewership, our listenership is growing exponentially by every metric.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:08.980]  And so what do they do?
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:26.934]  They have Amazon.com, Democratic Party-run, controlled Alexa, one of the main rating services, come out a year ago and lower the ratings 70% across the board of WorldNetDaily, DrugsReport.com, InfoWars.com, and any other libertarian website.
[00:11:27.708 --> 00:11:30.070]  They didn't really do it to mainline Republican sites.
[00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.533]  They did it to activist sites that are popular and dominating.
[00:11:33.533 --> 00:11:34.134]  Well, guess what?
[00:11:34.134 --> 00:11:37.457]  You're just not in this Politico article now as a metric.
[00:11:37.457 --> 00:11:45.684]  It doesn't matter if you claim that Mike Tyson in his prime wasn't the top heavyweight contender.
[00:11:45.684 --> 00:11:47.326]  He was.
[00:11:47.326 --> 00:11:54.012]  It doesn't matter if you change metrics overnight and then just declare we have no visitors when it's not true.
[00:11:56.175 --> 00:12:04.478]  And the reason I started the whole broadcast with this today is because if you understand this and how these hoaxes and frauds work, it's all over.
[00:12:04.478 --> 00:12:20.845]  They're tripling down and quadrupling down on their bravado, arrogance, chutzpah, hubris-filled dribble because they're desperate.
[00:12:20.845 --> 00:12:21.185]  Every
[00:12:24.571 --> 00:12:46.117]  Major establishment media platform already hemorrhaged out and big globalist insider corporations fat off banker bailouts and government contracts are propping them up because they don't want the embarrassment of admitting they're already dead.
[00:12:46.117 --> 00:12:51.559]  It's like National Lampoon's vacation where they act like the Aunt Edna is still alive and she's not.
[00:12:52.332 --> 00:12:53.032]  Or what's that movie?
[00:12:53.032 --> 00:12:54.493]  I only saw part of it.
[00:12:54.493 --> 00:12:58.156]  Weekend at Bernie's or something, where they got the dead body and they're hauling it around.
[00:12:58.156 --> 00:13:12.525]  I mean, that's what they're doing is propping up dead bodies, propping up a dead dinosaur, but it smells, it stinks, it's oozing, they're spewing talking points, you can see the failure in their eyes.
[00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:18.149]  The only power the zombie horde has is when they get their talking points, if they all
[00:13:19.261 --> 00:13:42.718]  In unison, push a hoax, and then get entertainment media pushing it as well, and get the movies pushing it as well, and get the video games pushing it, and every other platform, then they can get the dumbest of the sheeple, the most dumbed-down, drooling, unaware, unconscious slugs to adopt what they're saying and to go out and repeat it.
[00:13:45.179 --> 00:13:52.724]  But new media is the comet coming to kill the dinosaurs and the comet already hit.
[00:13:52.724 --> 00:13:56.467]  They're dead already politically.
[00:13:56.467 --> 00:13:57.507]  But here's the problem.
[00:13:57.507 --> 00:14:02.451]  They're transcending politics and just going to pure psych warfare.
[00:14:02.451 --> 00:14:04.072]  2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:14:04.072 --> 00:14:05.613]  You didn't build your business.
[00:14:05.613 --> 00:14:07.694]  If we raise the debt ceiling, it doesn't raise the debt.
[00:14:07.694 --> 00:14:08.835]  People say that's ridiculous.
[00:14:08.835 --> 00:14:09.876]  That's discrediting.
[00:14:09.876 --> 00:14:10.816]  No, it's not.
[00:14:10.816 --> 00:14:12.978]  When you've got a zombie constituency
[00:14:14.445 --> 00:14:18.047]  They've got new studies out that many people aren't even wiping their butts now.
[00:14:18.047 --> 00:14:22.850]  So I was going to be sarcastic and say, these are people that can't even wipe their own rear ends.
[00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:25.251]  They literally can't.
[00:14:25.251 --> 00:14:29.833]  Their constituents believe 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:14:29.833 --> 00:14:35.316]  Their constituents say, ban the Bible on the street in unison when they're asked.
[00:14:35.316 --> 00:14:36.677]  We played that a couple days ago.
[00:14:36.677 --> 00:14:37.758]  In fact, cue that back up.
[00:14:37.758 --> 00:14:38.798]  I want to play that.
[00:14:38.798 --> 00:14:39.859]  That's so powerful.
[00:14:39.859 --> 00:14:41.720]  We're going to go out in Austin and show that as well.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.361]  We can duplicate it in any trendy area.
[00:14:44.855 --> 00:14:53.623]  All these people have is arrogance that they're part of the ruling class when they're not.
[00:14:53.623 --> 00:14:55.624]  So that's all they have is a hoax.
[00:14:55.624 --> 00:15:03.631]  The problem is they're moving towards totalitarianism because they're losing the political debate.
[00:15:03.631 --> 00:15:09.517]  They're moving towards autocratic, technocratic, centralized, command and control,
[00:15:11.141 --> 00:15:23.927]  And they've got enough people that are awake, but choose to join with Soren, with the Emperor, with the Devil, with whatever that archetype is in your mind.
[00:15:23.927 --> 00:15:30.410]  That's why we're in so much trouble, is there are collaborators who don't even care if this system's pure evil.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:54.640]  They are going to choose to prey on the dumb ass and join the predator class, even though it's dishonorable, it's disreputable, it's destructive, and in their hearts, they know they're going to be destroyed in the end by it, but so many globalists tell me it doesn't matter, I'm going to be winning until that happens.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.801]  And it's because they're cowards.
[00:15:57.349 --> 00:16:10.253]  And there's so many evil people and sociopaths that didn't promote good, even though they could have gotten more power out of choosing good, because inherently, they don't want to be good.
[00:16:10.253 --> 00:16:19.896]  I mean, in a world of sellouts, in a world of idiots, in a world of parasites, in a world of predators, being a white knight is king!
[00:16:22.486 --> 00:16:23.647]  I am a moral person.
[00:16:23.647 --> 00:16:24.708]  I love justice.
[00:16:24.708 --> 00:16:26.349]  That's why I chose my path.
[00:16:26.349 --> 00:16:27.550]  I didn't do it to be famous.
[00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.551]  I didn't do it to be rich.
[00:16:30.327 --> 00:16:36.270]  I only expanded my operation and tried to gain some wealth to be able to defend myself.
[00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:41.112]  Because I was criticized for imaginary wealth ten years ago I didn't have.
[00:16:41.112 --> 00:16:54.798]  I neurotically, like the purest white knight you can imagine, spent 98% of the money coming in and lived in a very humble home and drove a very humble car until people accused me of doing all this for money.
[00:16:54.798 --> 00:16:56.759]  And I said, I'll show you money!
[00:16:58.444 --> 00:17:00.967]  And now I have enemies lined up to the sun.
[00:17:00.967 --> 00:17:01.608]  Great!
[00:17:01.608 --> 00:17:02.209]  Attack me!
[00:17:02.209 --> 00:17:04.572]  We have some backup.
[00:17:04.572 --> 00:17:05.973]  We have some depth.
[00:17:05.973 --> 00:17:08.937]  We have some strength against the storms.
[00:17:08.937 --> 00:17:13.443]  You build a lighthouse on the strong parapet of natural rock.
[00:17:15.666 --> 00:17:18.947]  And they lecture us, knowing we're Christian, knowing we're good.
[00:17:18.947 --> 00:17:20.407]  You didn't take enough immigrants.
[00:17:20.407 --> 00:17:22.128]  You didn't pay for enough anchor babies.
[00:17:22.128 --> 00:17:25.629]  How dare a libertarian group or conservative group sell a book?
[00:17:25.629 --> 00:17:29.410]  How dare, how dare WorldNetDaily sell books?
[00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.611]  How dare Matt Drudge have advertising?
[00:17:31.611 --> 00:17:36.672]  How dare, how dare, how dare, while they have taxpayer money in NPR?
[00:17:36.672 --> 00:17:37.873]  And taxpayer money in...
[00:17:38.673 --> 00:17:39.994]  MSNBC.
[00:17:39.994 --> 00:17:49.322]  While they suck off of us at gunpoint, they sit there and try to lecture us that we shouldn't ever build our own media.
[00:17:49.322 --> 00:17:53.206]  Last year they sued and got the thousands of pages of documents.
[00:17:53.206 --> 00:18:02.114]  I want to get Joseph Farah back on because so much of it was so incendiary he didn't even know if he could release it all from the Clinton library in Arkansas.
[00:18:03.277 --> 00:18:11.944]  And it was all in the early 90s, before Drudge existed, a few years before, when WorldNetDaily was going online as the Western Journalism Center.
[00:18:11.944 --> 00:18:20.051]  They were scared of Farrah, and they were scared of independent films like Jeremiah Films, the Clinton Chronicles, and they're talking about, how do we shut down new media?
[00:18:20.051 --> 00:18:23.433]  It'll be conservative, it'll be libertarian, it'll be liberal.
[00:18:23.433 --> 00:18:25.035]  We won't control it.
[00:18:25.035 --> 00:18:30.039]  We've got to demonize it, we've got to audit it, we've got to shut it down, we've got to call a conspiracy theorist.
[00:18:30.039 --> 00:18:32.661]  I mean, if an independent meteorological group started
[00:18:34.102 --> 00:18:37.743]  And said that, you know, they thought rain was coming, they'd call it a conspiracy theory.
[00:18:37.743 --> 00:18:42.945]  It's a way to shut down any intellectual debate that they don't control.
[00:18:42.945 --> 00:18:45.066]  And you can read the whole thing right there.
[00:18:45.066 --> 00:18:51.988]  Because they knew then, if they allowed an open, free market of ideas, that would be the end of them.
[00:18:51.988 --> 00:18:57.510]  I mean, who wants some old criminal witch like Hillary Clinton?
[00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:01.711]  Who really likes John Boehner, that burnout idiot?
[00:19:03.083 --> 00:19:04.384]  Who likes any of this scum?
[00:19:04.384 --> 00:19:05.305]  We're all sick of them.
[00:19:05.305 --> 00:19:06.286]  But they force feed us.
[00:19:06.286 --> 00:19:14.774]  But now I've got articles and videos up on Infowars.com where about 50 people showed up at a Hillary event to meet her.
[00:19:14.774 --> 00:19:18.017]  She's walking dead politically.
[00:19:18.017 --> 00:19:19.319]  Now can they resuscitate her?
[00:19:20.836 --> 00:19:28.444]  See, they can't help but force feed Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, and it shows how disconnected, again, they are.
[00:19:28.444 --> 00:19:35.871]  And we may not win in this round or the next round, but they're losing steam, they're losing control, they are falling apart.
[00:19:35.871 --> 00:19:37.533]  Not us!
[00:19:37.533 --> 00:19:40.355]  That's why they declare we're dead as we rise!
[00:19:41.502 --> 00:19:43.823]  Because we're the real liberals.
[00:19:43.823 --> 00:19:50.725]  We're the people that promote low taxes, having firearms, having privacy, running your own life.
[00:19:50.725 --> 00:19:53.866]  We're the people that promote 500 horsepower cars.
[00:19:53.866 --> 00:19:56.386]  We're the people that promote having fun.
[00:19:56.386 --> 00:19:58.287]  We're not the control freaks.
[00:19:59.591 --> 00:20:04.015]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[00:20:04.015 --> 00:20:08.078]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[00:20:08.078 --> 00:20:15.444]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s, and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[00:20:15.444 --> 00:20:20.688]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[00:20:20.688 --> 00:20:29.135]  If you want to boost your omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.

[00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:57.151]  Come and take it!
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:18.150]  I'm going to get into all the huge world news, incredible testimony from an abortion survivor and more.
[00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:19.810]  There's just so much to get to today.
[00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:26.554]  I'm also going to play that clip since I mentioned it because we played it in overdrive a couple days ago of almost every person, well-spoken,
[00:24:28.234 --> 00:24:34.056]  A lot of them older, liberal types, white people mainly, saying let's ban the Bible.
[00:24:34.056 --> 00:24:37.237]  Ban the sale of the Bible.
[00:24:37.237 --> 00:24:43.419]  And it just shows what a cult of authoritarians these people are.
[00:24:43.419 --> 00:24:51.441]  They have us be tolerant of them until they get into control, and then they become as totalitarian as North Korea.
[00:24:52.921 --> 00:25:07.909]  And anywhere you put collectivists in control, you end up in a hellish North Korea-slash-Stalinist gulag with little pot-bellied nobodies with submachine guns ruling over you while you starve to death.
[00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:09.170]  Because that's what they produce.
[00:25:10.393 --> 00:25:18.023]  And again, you've got big major corporations that get government bailouts, funding the major mainstream media, propping up the facade.
[00:25:18.023 --> 00:25:21.989]  Billions in bailout money going to NBC, General Electric.
[00:25:21.989 --> 00:25:24.752]  Hundreds of millions going into MSNBC of taxpayer money.
[00:25:26.112 --> 00:25:29.534]  Four hundred and something million a year to NPR for decades.
[00:25:29.534 --> 00:25:32.116]  Billions going into Planned Parenthood, all of it.
[00:25:32.116 --> 00:25:39.320]  And then what do they always sit around and lecture off the Clinton talking points from 1993 that were given to the media?
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.121]  This is in the Clinton Foundation.
[00:25:41.121 --> 00:25:42.662]  It's come out.
[00:25:42.662 --> 00:25:45.023]  The Clinton Library.
[00:25:45.023 --> 00:25:47.405]  That's a bigger deal than what World Down Daily even made of it.
[00:25:49.414 --> 00:25:52.135]  And Farrah said some of it was so damning he was scared to release it.
[00:25:52.135 --> 00:25:53.495]  I want to see it released a year later.
[00:25:53.495 --> 00:25:55.295]  In fact, call Farrah.
[00:25:55.295 --> 00:25:57.556]  Really tell him I want him to come on the show, please.
[00:25:57.556 --> 00:25:58.916]  And I want to know what else is in there.
[00:25:58.916 --> 00:26:07.939]  Because what was in there was bad enough what they released, a small part of it, was how they would shape the media, how they would shut down new media, how they would control information.
[00:26:07.939 --> 00:26:11.259]  Well, guess what, Hillary?
[00:26:11.259 --> 00:26:16.641]  It may have taken 25 years, but you failed, Your Highness.
[00:26:16.641 --> 00:26:17.721]  You failed miserably.
[00:26:19.281 --> 00:26:24.006]  And the fact that, what, two or three people run Drudge?
[00:26:24.006 --> 00:26:29.392]  It's pointed out you can tell when Drudge is on vacation because it's not as good than when he's doing it.
[00:26:29.392 --> 00:26:35.318]  Not knocking his other guys, it's just that he's the guru of what he does.
[00:26:35.318 --> 00:26:40.985]  So three people run something that reaches more people with news and politics
[00:26:42.898 --> 00:26:52.049]  Then Facebook, that's number two, that has been valued at over $100 billion.
[00:26:52.049 --> 00:26:58.937]  A $100 billion operation cannot counter three people.
[00:26:58.937 --> 00:27:03.162]  Because the truth, and not that any of us are infallible,
[00:27:06.266 --> 00:27:10.567]  Not that any of us have all the answers, but that we're trying to tell the truth.
[00:27:10.567 --> 00:27:13.208]  And the will to tell the truth trumps the fraud.
[00:27:13.208 --> 00:27:16.649]  And by the way, they had a $100 billion stock offering at first.
[00:27:16.649 --> 00:27:17.929]  I was being conservative.
[00:27:17.929 --> 00:27:19.210]  They just fact-checked me.
[00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:20.030]  I'm sorry.
[00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:22.071]  People think I exaggerate nine times out of ten.
[00:27:22.071 --> 00:27:23.051]  It's the opposite.
[00:27:23.051 --> 00:27:25.352]  Facebook is now worth more than Walmart.
[00:27:25.352 --> 00:27:26.352]  $245 billion.
[00:27:31.431 --> 00:27:32.852]  Thank you for correcting me.
[00:27:32.852 --> 00:27:35.454]  Almost two and a half times more value.
[00:27:35.454 --> 00:27:48.205]  So, it's worth $245 billion, and I've seen the Drudge Report valued in different news articles for $50 to $100 million.
[00:27:48.205 --> 00:27:51.507]  Just because of the influence.
[00:27:51.507 --> 00:27:58.713]  So you've got something with three people that trumps something with tens of thousands of people, $245 billion.
[00:28:01.187 --> 00:28:05.409]  See, my brain just automatically goes to the lowest number I know so that I'm not exaggerating.
[00:28:05.409 --> 00:28:09.811]  It's a neurotic thing I do, and because of it, I wanted to say it was worth over $200 billion.
[00:28:09.811 --> 00:28:12.152]  I just went from memory what I thought was safe.
[00:28:12.152 --> 00:28:14.273]  They check everything I say neurotically.
[00:28:14.273 --> 00:28:15.193]  Usually it's right.
[00:28:15.193 --> 00:28:15.974]  I was wrong.
[00:28:15.974 --> 00:28:19.215]  There's another example of where I knew it was worth $200 plus billion.
[00:28:19.215 --> 00:28:27.179]  I was going to say $240 plus billion, and I just went ahead and dialed back to their initial stock offering of what, six, seven years ago, or whatever it was, five years ago, of $100 billion.
[00:28:28.336 --> 00:28:30.257]  But I'm kind of digressing.
[00:28:30.257 --> 00:28:31.497]  People want this.
[00:28:31.497 --> 00:28:33.018]  Teleprompter free.
[00:28:33.018 --> 00:28:35.099]  Somebody trying to tell them the truth.
[00:28:35.099 --> 00:28:39.481]  Somebody busting their butt to be accurate.
[00:28:39.481 --> 00:28:46.224]  Versus someone saying, when you raised the debt limit, that doesn't raise the debt.
[00:28:46.224 --> 00:28:47.464]  Well, yes, it does.
[00:28:47.464 --> 00:28:52.526]  I don't care if you're part black and I'm racist because I say you're a liar.
[00:28:52.526 --> 00:28:56.148]  You are a liar, Barack Obama, and your race card doesn't work anymore.
[00:28:58.012 --> 00:29:03.075]  It may work on the sheeple, it may work on the lemmings, but here's the difference.
[00:29:03.075 --> 00:29:14.660]  Lemmings don't produce, lemmings are a joke, and it's the thinkers, it's the builders, it's the inventors, it's the fighters that will never submit to you.
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:23.705]  And 5% of liberty lovers will defeat the giant mass of drooling morons that are your servants.
[00:29:25.928 --> 00:29:27.269]  And so that's what it comes down to.
[00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:40.335]  So, you want to be allied with new automated smart grids that control everything in your central systems and robots, as if that is going to finally give you the armies you need to defeat good.
[00:29:40.335 --> 00:29:46.458]  Good only rises when you get the upper hand, and you're about to have your political arms ripped out of their sockets.
[00:29:46.458 --> 00:29:48.680]  News is coming up.
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.080]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.621]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.621 --> 00:29:55.303]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.528 --> 00:30:08.991]  Schools in Germany are ordering teenage girls not to wear miniskirts or shorts as to avoid offending Muslim immigrants.
[00:30:08.991 --> 00:30:19.674]  Parents were warned that their children should not wear revealing clothes for fear of misunderstandings that could lead to attacks by the migrants.
[00:30:19.674 --> 00:30:25.276]  Children were also told that derogatory or racial remarks will not be tolerated.
[00:30:26.116 --> 00:30:42.919]  The letter was actually sent out at the end of June, but it is drawing fresh attention in the light of Germany's plan to accept 800,000 new migrants before the end of the year, and 500,000 a year for the foreseeable future.
[00:30:42.919 --> 00:30:53.961]  InfoWars has been contacted by families in Germany who say that their schools are telling girls not to wear shorts, even in hot weather, to prevent sexual assaults by immigrants.
[00:30:54.401 --> 00:30:59.482]  Need to learn more about this story right now at InfoWars.com.

[00:31:03.563 --> 00:31:17.067]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world so prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.

[00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:07.750]  You got a business.
[00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:10.552]  You didn't build that.
[00:33:10.552 --> 00:33:19.716]  Somebody else made that happen.
[00:33:19.716 --> 00:33:24.619]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:33:24.619 --> 00:33:26.060]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:29.938 --> 00:33:32.800]  So, it is a facade.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.321]  The liberals are not liberals.
[00:33:34.321 --> 00:33:38.264]  They are social engineer eugenicist control freaks.
[00:33:38.264 --> 00:33:40.466]  It's military camouflage.
[00:33:40.466 --> 00:33:46.631]  They are scientifically focused, very wicked anti-human people.
[00:33:46.631 --> 00:33:51.714]  Their operatives control the Republican Party as well.
[00:33:51.714 --> 00:33:55.077]  Our job is to expose these enemies.
[00:33:55.077 --> 00:33:59.100]  And when I say enemies, I say that before God Almighty.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:22.420]  I'm very careful about who I attack, I'm very careful about who I judge, and I know for a fact the people that run the Democratic Party are willful, organized crime criminals that hate you and your family, and who are eugenicists, and who are narcotics traffickers, and child snuff film purveyors, and the worst murdering filth you can imagine.
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:25.002]  They are beyond serial killers.
[00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:29.611]  They want to wreck everything good.
[00:34:29.611 --> 00:34:31.531]  They want to wreck free market.
[00:34:31.531 --> 00:34:32.991]  They want you poor.
[00:34:32.991 --> 00:34:35.252]  They want to abort you before you're born.
[00:34:35.252 --> 00:34:37.893]  They want to inject you with deadly vaccines.
[00:34:37.893 --> 00:34:43.034]  They want to suck you dry before they kill you.
[00:34:43.034 --> 00:34:46.935]  Basically, they're an army of Satanists.
[00:34:46.935 --> 00:34:48.935]  And again, I don't mince words there.
[00:34:48.935 --> 00:34:56.197]  There is not rhetoric that will rise to the level of how bad they are.
[00:35:04.824 --> 00:35:15.793]  My mom's brother who died last year would never tell me Vietnam stories, even though he'd been shot down seven times, highly decorated, his main job was delivering special forces trips via helicopter.
[00:35:15.793 --> 00:35:18.935]  And I'd always ask him to tell me stories when I was a kid.
[00:35:18.935 --> 00:35:21.417]  And he finally, when I was a teenager, said, fine, I'll tell you stories.
[00:35:21.417 --> 00:35:25.200]  The smell of rotten flesh all the time.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:31.025]  All the blood and stuff would get in the helicopters and get down in the gears and get down in their bellies.
[00:35:32.642 --> 00:35:39.590]  And when you'd land helicopters, there'd be the smell of rotten flesh, and there'd be dead bodies of men, women, and children laying around, bloating in the sun.
[00:35:44.008 --> 00:35:47.529]  Because if you've heard enough, it's not fancy, it's not fun, it's not cool.
[00:35:47.529 --> 00:35:56.893]  I remember getting old World War II vets that were friends with my grandfather, who would let them, you know, hunt on our property every year on the first day of deer season, right after Thanksgiving.
[00:35:56.893 --> 00:36:00.714]  There'd be like 20, 30 old World War II vets, and over the years they all died.
[00:36:00.714 --> 00:36:06.416]  They were all so cool and fun to talk to, that I'd always, tell me a World War II story, tell me a World War II story.
[00:36:06.416 --> 00:36:08.417]  And they would rarely tell me any stories, but
[00:36:10.563 --> 00:36:20.651]  One of them was telling me, yeah, the worst part was it wasn't just that the Nazis had forced labor camps and death camps, but millions of Germans were starving to death every month or so there at the end of the war.
[00:36:20.651 --> 00:36:26.656]  20 million Germans died, about half of them starving to death, and they would have them once they'd taken an area,
[00:36:27.276 --> 00:36:34.422]  Just bulldozed dead bodies as far as the eye could see with blackbirds eating the flesh off the bones.
[00:36:34.422 --> 00:36:37.385]  And they said it was the smell of rotten meat.
[00:36:37.385 --> 00:36:41.828]  No matter where you were, the smell of the dying people.
[00:36:41.828 --> 00:36:44.971]  The smell of their rotting bodies.
[00:36:44.971 --> 00:36:49.155]  And having to drag them around all day and bulldoze them into big piles.
[00:36:50.145 --> 00:36:57.927]  Then another one, another vet, Elmer Nebbles, I was bugging him when he was cooking gravy for biscuits at like 4.30 in the morning because I was going to ride with him.
[00:36:57.927 --> 00:37:05.070]  He had an old van he'd take off-road to these gullies and stuff that he had all rigged up with big tires.
[00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:06.750]  And he goes, you want to hear a story?
[00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:08.611]  Worst part was killing beautiful women.
[00:37:10.629 --> 00:37:13.872]  You know, like your mama, your mama's a real pretty blonde.
[00:37:13.872 --> 00:37:23.781]  Well, they'd send them out there, look like Marilyn Monroe, and they'd open up a fur coat and pull a machine gun out, and I'd cut them in half.
[00:37:23.781 --> 00:37:29.406]  And, little kids, you're sitting there, he goes, now are you done asking those questions?
[00:37:29.406 --> 00:37:33.530]  He was a sweet old guy, until I kept pestering him to tell me a World War II story.
[00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:35.892]  And I learned really quick, don't ask the World War II stories.
[00:37:42.142 --> 00:37:51.849]  And now we're in this modern world where the bodies aren't all rotting out in front of us with thousands of birds eating their bodies like something out of Hellraiser.
[00:37:51.849 --> 00:37:58.994]  It's done through vaccines and through fluoride and through GMOs and the doctors are compartmentalized.
[00:37:58.994 --> 00:37:59.935]  They're not part of it.
[00:37:59.935 --> 00:38:01.956]  And you bring your little kid in and they get the shots.
[00:38:01.956 --> 00:38:03.637]  They have convulsions.
[00:38:03.637 --> 00:38:05.519]  20 years later, they're soft killed in diapers.
[00:38:08.029 --> 00:38:11.231]  You know, the way the Globalist hit us, we never know what hit us.
[00:38:11.231 --> 00:38:13.392]  It kills us 10 years later, 20 years later.
[00:38:13.392 --> 00:38:14.992]  It's so funny to them.
[00:38:14.992 --> 00:38:15.913]  They're laughing.
[00:38:15.913 --> 00:38:20.755]  They enjoy that they're in on it.
[00:38:20.755 --> 00:38:24.437]  The ruling establishment knows they've poisoned you and your family.
[00:38:24.437 --> 00:38:25.577]  They like it.
[00:38:25.577 --> 00:38:32.661]  They want to hurt you.
[00:38:32.661 --> 00:38:34.862]  And they've got huge armies of people
[00:38:37.233 --> 00:38:41.777]  Because Mark Dice, we used to do these videos showing dumb liberals who aren't really liberals.
[00:38:41.777 --> 00:38:43.118]  He started doing it in California.
[00:38:43.118 --> 00:38:48.223]  We went out there in the very same areas last year and duplicated it with our reporters.
[00:38:48.223 --> 00:38:51.025]  We do it in Austin and get pretty much the same response.
[00:38:51.025 --> 00:38:56.870]  We get 7 out of 10 saying put gun owners in forced labor camps and kill us or ban Christianity.
[00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:57.991]  He gets 8 or 9 out of 10 to do it.
[00:39:00.322 --> 00:39:01.623]  And let me explain something to you.
[00:39:01.623 --> 00:39:08.827]  I can walk pretty much anywhere in Austin, near the university or a trendy area, and they will say, put gun owners in slave camps.
[00:39:08.827 --> 00:39:10.227]  They're ready to do it.
[00:39:10.227 --> 00:39:20.993]  Now, if I go to a blue collar area with a bunch of work trucks, with a bunch of guys that are plumbers, black, white, Hispanic, you name it, they'll say, how about you get out of here before we kick your butt, buddy?
[00:39:20.993 --> 00:39:22.934]  We have a right to own guns in this country.
[00:39:22.934 --> 00:39:25.136]  The people working know what's going on.
[00:39:25.136 --> 00:39:27.277]  You go in a wealthy area, there'll be lots of crazy
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:32.221]  We have a Second Amendment, but you go to the trendy areas with all the know-it-alls?
[00:39:32.221 --> 00:39:36.902]  These people are dangerous.
[00:39:36.902 --> 00:39:39.943]  That's what I'm getting at.
[00:39:39.943 --> 00:39:41.723]  They'll take everything we've got.
[00:39:41.723 --> 00:39:45.384]  They'll suck it out of us and never think twice.
[00:39:45.384 --> 00:39:46.024]  But here's the difference.
[00:39:46.024 --> 00:39:49.105]  They're never going to reach the promised land.
[00:39:49.105 --> 00:39:52.966]  They're just the dumb idiots helping sell things down the rathole.
[00:39:52.966 --> 00:39:57.627]  When the globalists come to full power, they're the first people that are going to be on the chopping block.
[00:40:01.058 --> 00:40:10.281]  So the New World Order social engineers have been real good at hiding a lot of their evil behind the scenes, but all of that is now coming to a close.
[00:40:10.281 --> 00:40:17.563]  And everything's starting to unravel and it can't be hidden anymore, and that's why they're trying to accelerate their program, because they're behind schedule.
[00:40:17.563 --> 00:40:26.206]  So be happy in our discontent, be happy in our problems, because it's like when you get the flu and you're throwing up,
[00:40:27.998 --> 00:40:29.588]  Your body's getting the virus out.
[00:40:29.588 --> 00:40:30.756]  Your body's emptying out.
[00:40:32.059 --> 00:40:32.919]  You're going to get better.
[00:40:32.919 --> 00:40:55.589]  That high fever is going to burn through that virus and we have to go through this and we're here warning people as the shock troops saying the stuff nobody will say because the attack is so big, so evil, so calculated, so over-the-top that they know the average wholesome person can't deal with it, can't process it because it's so over-the-top and so diabolical.
[00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:58.210]  It's my job to be attacked
[00:40:59.568 --> 00:41:06.950]  To be demonized, to be taken out of context because I know that everything we talk about is going to start unfolding.
[00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:08.150]  So much of it already has.
[00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:10.471]  60-70% already has.
[00:41:10.471 --> 00:41:13.072]  And so now the ridicule doesn't work.
[00:41:13.072 --> 00:41:16.873]  Now the ridicule is a red badge of honor.
[00:41:16.873 --> 00:41:19.814]  It's the mark of courage.
[00:41:19.814 --> 00:41:21.034]  It's the blood of victory.
[00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:31.493]  How many people that are establishment folks get the word their 10-year-old's got cancer?
[00:41:31.493 --> 00:41:35.897]  That'll wake you up real fast.
[00:41:35.897 --> 00:41:44.263]  How many cops you think wake up in big cities when they get briefings that veterans and gun owners are the enemy and the feds expect a civil war with gun confiscation?
[00:41:44.263 --> 00:41:47.626]  You think that wakes the police up when they get called in and get told that?
[00:41:47.626 --> 00:41:52.610]  And then the founding fathers are bad-mouthed?
[00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:54.171]  In major cities across the country?
[00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:01.654]  Now, if we wouldn't have warned them that was coming beforehand, they wouldn't have gotten as freaked out, maybe.
[00:42:01.654 --> 00:42:10.782]  But now, they know the rest of the agenda attached to it, so now they've got to be prepared for destruction when the establishment tries to take over.
[00:42:10.782 --> 00:42:20.891]  Don't think the globalists don't have big computer algorithm diagram actuaries of exactly what your department's made up of and who you stand for and what you're going to do.
[00:42:20.891 --> 00:42:21.992]  You've been marked
[00:42:23.387 --> 00:42:27.509]  By hardcore criminals for extermination.
[00:42:27.509 --> 00:42:32.953]  And we're just here giving you the heads up, because we're all in the same boat together, whether we admit that or not.
[00:42:32.953 --> 00:42:40.737]  That if they try to pull that hammer, if they drop that hammer, that hammer dropping is going to destroy them, because we're not going to be caught flat-footed.
[00:42:40.737 --> 00:42:43.899]  We're ready, and we know what's going on.
[00:42:43.899 --> 00:42:49.302]  And we've done everything we can in a wholesome way to try to stop this.
[00:42:49.302 --> 00:42:51.904]  We have been defending peace.
[00:42:55.762 --> 00:42:58.943]  By preparing for war.
[00:42:58.943 --> 00:43:10.789]  While we have been warning and offensively getting the word out and digging in at the same time.
[00:43:10.789 --> 00:43:21.214]  And if the establishment is crazy enough to make a full hot move, their cold war is failing against the patriots of the world.
[00:43:21.214 --> 00:43:23.455]  It'll be a bridge too far.
[00:43:23.455 --> 00:43:23.815]  It'll be
[00:43:26.678 --> 00:43:31.981]  A touch too much, and it'll be the end of their new world order.
[00:43:31.981 --> 00:43:35.283]  Dead on arrival.
[00:43:35.283 --> 00:43:43.588]  And so we are here affecting the current, near future, and future sociological space.
[00:43:43.588 --> 00:43:45.550]  The battle space.
[00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:49.752]  And knowing you're under attack is half the battle.
[00:43:49.752 --> 00:43:51.153]  And by the way, that's not from G.I.
[00:43:51.153 --> 00:43:53.875]  Joe, that's an old army saying that they put in the cartoon.
[00:43:55.350 --> 00:44:03.954]  Knowing who the enemy is, knowing where they are, knowing who they are, knowing how they operate is half the battle.
[00:44:03.954 --> 00:44:09.276]  The rest of the battle is simply pointing out, we're the good guys, you're the bad guys.
[00:44:09.276 --> 00:44:13.939]  Fundamentally, at a gut level, everybody knows that.
[00:44:13.939 --> 00:44:15.579]  They know evil's rising.
[00:44:15.579 --> 00:44:20.101]  They know it's coming after the people.
[00:44:20.101 --> 00:44:22.583]  And they've got an army, probably 30% of the public,
[00:44:24.977 --> 00:44:29.701]  That are totalitarians, that are selfish, that are weak, that are pathetic.
[00:44:29.701 --> 00:44:32.523]  Who think it's cool to ban the Bible.
[00:44:32.523 --> 00:44:34.864]  Who think it's cool to arrest gun owners.
[00:44:34.864 --> 00:44:37.486]  Who think it's cool to forcibly abort babies.
[00:44:37.486 --> 00:44:42.070]  Who think it's cool, they think by submitting to the system, they gain power.
[00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:45.853]  That's how pathetic they are.
[00:44:45.853 --> 00:44:49.535]  Now coming up, poll, Donald Trump surges to 32% support.
[00:44:49.535 --> 00:44:51.577]  Bernie Sanders overtakes Hillary Clinton in Iowa.
[00:44:53.237 --> 00:44:56.519]  The Pope meeting secretly with John Boehner.
[00:44:56.519 --> 00:45:03.124]  Saudi Arabia has 100,000 air-conditioned tents that can house 3 million people sitting empty, yet has taken zero refugees.
[00:45:03.124 --> 00:45:08.648]  But nobody's going to criticize them because the Saudi royal house has brown skin.
[00:45:08.648 --> 00:45:16.353]  So, if they go cause the wars that cause the refugees, that's okay.
[00:45:16.353 --> 00:45:17.374]  They don't have to do anything.
[00:45:24.301 --> 00:45:26.602]  So, that's all going to be coming up as well.
[00:45:26.602 --> 00:45:28.543]  We've got MS-13 running around crazy.
[00:45:28.543 --> 00:45:30.543]  Massive illegal waves coming in there.
[00:45:30.543 --> 00:45:31.924]  Economy news and more.
[00:45:31.924 --> 00:45:37.106]  I've got Donald Trump backpedaling saying, oh no, we shouldn't take all of these, quote, migrants.
[00:45:37.106 --> 00:45:39.367]  How about I just migrate and come knock on your door?
[00:45:39.367 --> 00:45:40.887]  Like, I'm going to do this with a camera.
[00:45:40.887 --> 00:45:41.407]  I'm serious.
[00:45:41.407 --> 00:45:42.148]  Make me do it.
[00:45:42.148 --> 00:45:45.589]  I know I'm busy, but I want to do it in the next few days.
[00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:50.051]  And I'm going to go to trendy areas that have Democrat signs in their yards, and I'm going to say, hey,
[00:45:50.939 --> 00:45:51.719]  I'm a migrant.
[00:45:51.719 --> 00:45:55.781]  I'd like to move into your house, and I'd like a free lunch, and I'd like to have your easy chair.
[00:45:55.781 --> 00:45:56.841]  Get off my porch, man!
[00:45:56.841 --> 00:45:59.142]  But I'm a migrant.
[00:45:59.142 --> 00:46:00.282]  I mean, I have a right.
[00:46:00.282 --> 00:46:03.343]  Will you pay for me to have a baby?
[00:46:03.343 --> 00:46:05.024]  They're gonna laugh at me.
[00:46:05.024 --> 00:46:09.945]  But see, that's their attitude, because they're stealing, they're getting government contracts, they're getting welfare.
[00:46:09.945 --> 00:46:13.967]  So see, this is a voting box to help them get more of the goodies.
[00:46:13.967 --> 00:46:14.667]  They want to rob me.
[00:46:17.025 --> 00:46:19.146]  But see, they don't want to pay for anything I'm doing.
[00:46:19.146 --> 00:46:21.986]  The most selfish people you could ever imagine.
[00:46:21.986 --> 00:46:23.847]  With their rackets.
[00:46:23.847 --> 00:46:25.547]  Now let's see some of these selfish people.
[00:46:25.547 --> 00:46:27.167]  If you're a radio listener, it's powerful.
[00:46:27.167 --> 00:46:28.888]  But if you're a TV viewer, it's even more so.
[00:46:28.888 --> 00:46:31.949]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:46:31.949 --> 00:46:35.690]  Mark Dice, San Diego, packed fall beach.
[00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:37.110]  Looks awesome.
[00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:39.711]  And he shows everyone he talks to.
[00:46:39.711 --> 00:46:41.371]  This is not just finding the idiots.
[00:46:41.371 --> 00:46:44.912]  This is shockingly, again, the same number, about 8 out of 10,
[00:46:46.809 --> 00:46:51.153]  Saying ban the sale of the Bible in bookstores and on Amazon.
[00:46:51.153 --> 00:46:52.374]  Here it is.
[00:46:52.374 --> 00:47:07.709]  Mark Dice here at the beach with a petition asking people to ban the Bible from Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble bookstores to see if these liberal fascist anti-First Amendment scum will agree to pulling the Bible from these stores.
[00:47:08.729 --> 00:47:09.369]  Excuse me.
[00:47:09.369 --> 00:47:12.110]  We're trying to get Amazon.com to pull the Bible.
[00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:14.791]  There's a lot of hate speech in there.
[00:47:14.791 --> 00:47:19.873]  We're trying to gather the signatures to get them to just remove it from the listing.
[00:47:19.873 --> 00:47:23.414]  So, to support that, we just need you to print Birthday Signature.
[00:47:23.414 --> 00:47:27.215]  We're submitting it to Amazon.com and to Barnes & Noble.
[00:47:27.215 --> 00:47:29.716]  Just to have them remove the Bible from the listing.
[00:47:29.716 --> 00:47:32.036]  Just to stop hate speech.
[00:47:32.036 --> 00:47:36.038]  These Christians don't need to be buying that kind of material these days.
[00:47:36.038 --> 00:47:36.638]  Wouldn't you agree?
[00:47:37.598 --> 00:47:38.339]  That's true.
[00:47:38.339 --> 00:47:38.839]  That's true.
[00:47:38.839 --> 00:47:39.820]  That's true.
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:46.284]  Yeah, we're just gonna get Barnes & Noble and Amazon.com just to stop selling that kind of material.
[00:47:46.284 --> 00:47:49.886]  I mean, I guess you could still, if you own one, you could still keep it, I guess.
[00:47:49.886 --> 00:47:52.108]  We just don't want any new ones being sold.
[00:47:52.108 --> 00:47:53.489]  Thank you for supporting that.
[00:47:53.489 --> 00:47:56.511]  To stop with the hate speech and the homophobia.
[00:47:56.511 --> 00:48:02.215]  But we need a few more signatures just to make sure that we can ban the Bible from being sold anymore.
[00:48:02.215 --> 00:48:05.037]  People don't need to be buying that kind of book these days, wouldn't you agree?
[00:48:05.037 --> 00:48:05.517]  Yes.
[00:48:06.426 --> 00:48:08.407]  Absolutely.
[00:48:08.407 --> 00:48:12.908]  I'm not sure where these people get this idea that they think they have the right to buy that kind of material, right?
[00:48:12.908 --> 00:48:13.428]  Yes, sir.
[00:48:13.428 --> 00:48:14.308]  Thanks for supporting that.
[00:48:14.308 --> 00:48:16.488]  Appreciate that.
[00:48:16.488 --> 00:48:22.150]  Selfless fight homophobia, trying to stop with the anti-homosexual hate speech.
[00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:24.270]  We're just trying to get Amazon.com... Who's doing that?
[00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:27.851]  Well, the Christians and their Bible... Come on, I'll sign it right now.
[00:48:27.851 --> 00:48:31.272]  We're trying to get Amazon.com to pull all sales of the Bible.
[00:48:31.272 --> 00:48:32.152]  Just print your name there.
[00:48:33.283 --> 00:48:38.168]  Print birthday signature to support Amazon.com pulling the Bible.
[00:48:38.168 --> 00:48:42.152]  These people don't need to be purchasing that kind of material these days, wouldn't you agree?
[00:48:43.612 --> 00:48:45.814]  If they want it, they can go get it somewhere else.
[00:48:45.814 --> 00:48:46.254]  Oh my gosh.
[00:48:46.254 --> 00:48:47.035]  I got it from Amazon.
[00:48:47.035 --> 00:48:49.437]  Thank you so much.
[00:48:49.437 --> 00:48:51.579]  But we need a few more signatures.
[00:48:51.579 --> 00:48:53.941]  Now one guy gets mad and almost attacks him.
[00:48:53.941 --> 00:48:57.564]  This is a normal response to a hardcore fascist.
[00:48:57.564 --> 00:49:03.169]  Delisted from Amazon.com and taken away from the shelves in Barnes & Noble and other bookstores.
[00:49:03.169 --> 00:49:07.873]  But we still needed a few more signatures to show the American people are on board with that.
[00:49:07.873 --> 00:49:08.434]  Wouldn't you agree?
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:12.060]  It's time to get rid of that kind of material?
[00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:13.261]  Hell yeah!
[00:49:13.261 --> 00:49:14.441]  Thank you for supporting that.
[00:49:14.441 --> 00:49:16.501]  I appreciate that.
[00:49:16.501 --> 00:49:30.644]  I'm trying to get Amazon.com to stop selling homophobic material like the Bible and other things, but I need a few more signatures to make sure that they delist that.
[00:49:30.644 --> 00:49:36.625]  Wouldn't you agree it's time the Bible stopped being sold around these outlets?
[00:49:36.625 --> 00:49:37.665]  Thank you for supporting that.
[00:49:39.156 --> 00:49:42.717]  This petition will help to remove the Bible from Amazon.com.
[00:49:42.717 --> 00:49:44.198]  This is actually a 9 out of 10 sign-in.
[00:49:44.198 --> 00:49:47.139]  Just to help fight for the New World Order.
[00:49:47.139 --> 00:49:49.000]  Just to help fight for freedom.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.120]  Want to help us out here?
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:56.542]  It's about time we do take these radical measures like this for the New World Order.
[00:49:56.542 --> 00:49:58.343]  Just to help move America forward.
[00:49:59.705 --> 00:50:03.069]  Delisting the Bible from Amazon and Barnes & Noble bookshelves too.
[00:50:03.069 --> 00:50:04.430]  We're going to get it pulled from there.
[00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:05.511]  Thank you for supporting that.
[00:50:05.511 --> 00:50:07.493]  Thank you so much.
[00:50:07.493 --> 00:50:16.423]  For trying to get Amazon.com to ban the sales of the Bible just to help stop the hate speech.
[00:50:16.423 --> 00:50:20.467]  I'm not sure why these people think they have a right to buy that kind of material these days.
[00:50:20.467 --> 00:50:21.108]  Wouldn't you agree?
[00:50:23.803 --> 00:50:28.266]  You know what I'm finding interesting is that the people who don't want to sign it are being way too nice about it.
[00:50:28.266 --> 00:50:29.407]  No, no thank you.
[00:50:29.407 --> 00:50:30.688]  Not today.
[00:50:30.688 --> 00:50:33.050]  They have absolutely no spine.
[00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:37.874]  And this is why Christians are getting crushed and have been targeted for termination.
[00:50:37.874 --> 00:50:43.118]  Because they don't have the spine to stand up for their rights or for their beliefs.
[00:50:43.118 --> 00:50:47.461]  You know, we don't need that kind of material being sold on Amazon or in stores.
[00:50:47.461 --> 00:50:48.062]  Wouldn't you agree?
[00:50:50.513 --> 00:50:52.597]  Yeah, you can buy it anywhere else.
[00:50:52.597 --> 00:50:53.258]  Somewhere else.
[00:50:53.258 --> 00:50:54.882]  Thank you for supporting that band.
[00:50:54.882 --> 00:50:57.146]  We're gonna try to get it removed as soon as possible.
[00:50:57.146 --> 00:50:57.446]  Thank you.
[00:50:59.887 --> 00:51:04.630]  We're trying to get Amazon.com to pull the Bible to stop selling it.
[00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:05.010]  Why?
[00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:05.951]  What's wrong with that?
[00:51:05.951 --> 00:51:12.975]  You know, a lot of the homosexuals are offended by it and we just feel that it's maybe time to pull it from Barnes & Noble.
[00:51:12.975 --> 00:51:14.136]  That's ridiculous!
[00:51:14.136 --> 00:51:15.516]  Absolutely ridiculous!
[00:51:15.516 --> 00:51:16.857]  You've got to be kidding me.
[00:51:16.857 --> 00:51:17.858]  I am kidding you, actually.
[00:51:17.858 --> 00:51:19.319]  We're doing a hidden camera prank.
[00:51:19.319 --> 00:51:19.779]  Yeah, right.
[00:51:19.779 --> 00:51:20.239]  No, we are.
[00:51:20.239 --> 00:51:20.760]  Look over here.
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:21.180]  Check it out.
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:22.040]  No, stop.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:22.761]  Stop.
[00:51:22.761 --> 00:51:23.942]  You're out here trying to get that stuff.
[00:51:23.942 --> 00:51:24.562]  That's crap.
[00:51:24.562 --> 00:51:26.943]  No, we're just demonstrating how the people will support that.
[00:51:28.064 --> 00:51:30.145]  Yeah, well it's a bunch of crap.
[00:51:30.145 --> 00:51:31.406]  I'm trying to tell you what we're doing.
[00:51:31.406 --> 00:51:33.447]  It's a First Amendment issue.
[00:51:33.447 --> 00:51:40.450]  We're showing how people will violate the First Amendment of the Christians because they're so biased and hateful towards Christians.
[00:51:40.450 --> 00:51:42.531]  That's why I told you we're doing a hidden camera prank over here.
[00:51:42.531 --> 00:51:44.072]  You're absolutely right.
[00:51:44.072 --> 00:51:47.974]  I'm pretending to be a radical liberal to see if they'll sign it.
[00:51:47.974 --> 00:51:48.514]  And they are.
[00:51:48.514 --> 00:51:49.655]  They're like, yeah, let's ban that.
[00:51:49.655 --> 00:51:50.935]  Let's get that delisted.
[00:51:50.935 --> 00:51:55.898]  We're just showing how the liberals are so hypocritical that they'll want to take away the First Amendment of the Christians.
[00:51:55.898 --> 00:51:56.578]  So it is ridiculous.
[00:51:57.178 --> 00:51:58.179]  Thank you very much.
[00:51:58.179 --> 00:51:59.799]  That's the kind of reaction I've been expecting.
[00:51:59.799 --> 00:52:00.720]  Great, great.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.501]  Thank you for being a normal American.
[00:52:02.501 --> 00:52:04.962]  Appreciate it.
[00:52:28.493 --> 00:52:30.814]  These are cult members!
[00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:36.156]  And I know I keep hammering that, it's just, it's really hit me lately.
[00:52:36.156 --> 00:52:40.517]  And I get mad at them now.
[00:52:40.517 --> 00:52:50.321]  I went to the hike and bike trail yesterday morning and I saw a lady getting in her car that said, I love Obamacare.
[00:52:50.321 --> 00:52:54.142]  And my phone was dead because I hadn't been charging it, or I would have videotaped this.
[00:52:55.691 --> 00:52:57.272]  I was about to go up and meet Buckley.
[00:52:57.272 --> 00:53:03.516]  We also shoot a Facebook mentions right before I go hiking or jogging, depending on what you do.
[00:53:03.516 --> 00:53:08.920]  And I said to her, I said, Hey, have you gone under Obamacare yet?
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:11.022]  And she just wouldn't even talk to me.
[00:53:11.022 --> 00:53:12.122]  I said, well, you got a bumper sticker.
[00:53:12.122 --> 00:53:15.104]  I'm asking you a question.
[00:53:15.104 --> 00:53:15.845]  And I said, let me guess.
[00:53:15.845 --> 00:53:22.009]  You're a state employer, a federal employee, and it's all handled by that.
[00:53:22.009 --> 00:53:23.210]  You don't even know, do you?
[00:53:25.649 --> 00:53:36.111]  And I looked into the window of her car and went, oh yeah, look right there, you got a state employee, state of Texas deal hanging around your mirror.
[00:53:36.111 --> 00:53:38.452]  She's like, whatever, whatever, just got in her car.
[00:53:38.452 --> 00:53:41.813]  I mean, she doesn't even know what she signed on to.
[00:53:41.813 --> 00:53:43.733]  She doesn't even live in the real world.
[00:53:43.733 --> 00:53:50.795]  Written by foreign insurance companies whose profits are out the roof right now, fraudulently,
[00:53:52.552 --> 00:53:54.694]  Massively increasing premiums.
[00:53:54.694 --> 00:53:56.676]  My insurance has more than doubled.
[00:53:56.676 --> 00:54:09.390]  My parents, who haven't had a claim in decades, who have full coverage for catastrophic events, who pay their regular doctor bills, saw it double the first year, and then now it's almost doubled again.
[00:54:11.758 --> 00:54:17.943]  And then I tried to go renegotiate and get new insurance, and they go, sorry, you have to wait until September, so it's now September.
[00:54:17.943 --> 00:54:21.746]  That's when open enrollment happens, so I can try to go find something cheaper.
[00:54:21.746 --> 00:54:27.971]  I mean, I used to just call up whoever I wanted and get rates, and no, it's all gone now!
[00:54:27.971 --> 00:54:28.752]  Thanks a lot!
[00:54:30.011 --> 00:54:31.473]  For screwing everyone over!
[00:54:31.473 --> 00:54:36.461]  And then Gruber sits there and laughs and says how dumb we are and how it is a big screw job!
[00:54:36.461 --> 00:54:37.643]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:54:37.643 --> 00:54:38.564]  Ha ha ha!
[00:54:38.564 --> 00:54:43.171]  And you people stick stickers on your car about what a great deal it is!
[00:54:44.790 --> 00:55:05.423]  You people are part of a schmuck cult, a idiot cult, where you celebrate being used, where you celebrate being morons, where you celebrate being screwed, where you celebrate being fooled, and dragging all the rest of us along with you to hell!
[00:55:05.423 --> 00:55:07.284]  And I'm so sick of all your labels.
[00:55:07.284 --> 00:55:08.885]  I'm not a Republican.
[00:55:08.885 --> 00:55:10.046]  I'm not a Democrat.
[00:55:11.247 --> 00:55:17.289]  I oppose tyranny, I oppose monopolies, I oppose not having choice.
[00:55:17.289 --> 00:55:19.589]  And you people are a joke!
[00:55:36.368 --> 00:55:39.410]  We're going to play that next hour.
[00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:41.292]  Congress starts the Planned Parenthood hearings.
[00:55:41.292 --> 00:55:43.813]  I hope it's on a whitewash, but victory's ours.
[00:55:43.813 --> 00:55:44.214]  Don't worry.
[00:55:44.214 --> 00:55:45.515]  I'm going to talk about how we're going to win.
[00:55:45.515 --> 00:55:47.276]  This is just the beginning.
[00:55:47.276 --> 00:55:48.637]  They'll try to whitewash this.
[00:55:48.637 --> 00:55:50.158]  There'll be more infiltrations.
[00:55:50.158 --> 00:55:55.802]  There'll be more Veritas-style infiltrations by other groups, by us, you name it.
[00:55:55.802 --> 00:55:58.144]  No one's stopping.
[00:55:58.144 --> 00:56:03.648]  And all the great anonymous patriots that are tired out there are now moving against the enemy.
[00:56:03.648 --> 00:56:04.989]  We're beyond the cell structure.
[00:56:06.757 --> 00:56:07.477]  of a resistance.
[00:56:07.477 --> 00:56:09.298]  We don't even have cells.
[00:56:09.298 --> 00:56:22.748]  We have hearts, and we're directed by Providence and by a love of the innocents, and our people are everywhere, and we will never stop, and we will never forget your crimes, and our numbers are growing, and we are in every organization, every system.
[00:56:22.748 --> 00:56:24.409]  We are watching you.
[00:56:24.409 --> 00:56:25.890]  We are going to expose you.
[00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:29.012]  We are now moving against you on every front.
[00:56:29.012 --> 00:56:30.914]  That's coming up.
[00:56:30.914 --> 00:56:32.575]  The fall of Hillary becomes more imminent.
[00:56:33.854 --> 00:56:39.538]  I'll admit I'm licking my chops, not out of some personal vendetta, but the fall of the Clintons will have a chain reaction.
[00:56:39.538 --> 00:56:42.119]  I'm going to talk about that.
[00:56:42.119 --> 00:56:44.861]  It's all coming up, the secret meeting.
[00:56:44.861 --> 00:56:46.982]  Notice, Boehner and Pope to meet privately.
[00:56:46.982 --> 00:56:55.488]  No, that's to meet secretly with another head of state who wants to open our borders and have carbon taxes to meet secretly with the traitor Boehner.
[00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:06.115]  So the Pope's going to meet privately with Boner.
[00:57:06.115 --> 00:57:11.739]  It is truly sickening.
[00:57:11.739 --> 00:57:13.100]  That's all coming up.
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:20.486]  Briefly, if you want to help fund this operation, we're not funded by taking your tax money or the IRS at gunpoint, giving it to the Democrats or all the rest of it.
[00:57:20.486 --> 00:57:23.088]  We're funded by hardcore products we believe in and use.
[00:57:23.088 --> 00:57:30.994]  Whether it's mini cook stoves, high-quality water filtration, discount with promo code WATER10%, the Hillary for Prison shirts that are so popular,
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:32.660]  I'm
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:06.321]  Brain Force is back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:06.321 --> 00:58:11.502]  We are about to sell out of Liver Shield, the part of the liver cleanse package.
[00:58:11.502 --> 00:58:14.103]  Limited supply of that came in if you want that.
[00:58:14.103 --> 00:58:20.064]  The deep cleanse for the entire body that's so amazing is back in stock at Infowarslife.com.

[00:58:34.367 --> 00:58:35.147]  It's back.

[00:58:39.028 --> 00:58:40.289]  We're teleprompter free.
[00:58:40.289 --> 00:58:41.549]  We know we're under attack.
[00:58:41.549 --> 00:58:42.469]  We're on fire.
[00:58:42.469 --> 00:58:43.409]  We've only begun.
[00:58:43.409 --> 00:58:44.810]  Nothing's gonna stop us.
[00:58:49.102 --> 00:58:58.214]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:58:58.214 --> 00:59:06.305]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:59:06.605 --> 00:59:11.467]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:59:11.467 --> 00:59:18.270]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:25.452]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:59:25.452 --> 00:59:32.295]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:59:32.455 --> 00:59:36.937]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:59:36.937 --> 00:59:40.338]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:59:40.338 --> 00:59:46.621]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:59:46.621 --> 00:59:51.743]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:51.743 --> 00:59:54.344]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.222 --> 01:00:06.522]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.522 --> 01:00:08.283]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.283 --> 01:00:10.043]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.043 --> 01:00:11.623]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.623 --> 01:00:13.163]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.163 --> 01:00:17.364]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.364 --> 01:00:22.625]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.625 --> 01:00:27.886]  I was thinking during that 72nd break as we entered the last hour why I'm so crazed.
[01:00:27.886 --> 01:00:30.686]  I'm sitting on a dock bass fishing.
[01:00:30.686 --> 01:00:32.547]  I'm like a sweet old man.
[01:00:32.547 --> 01:00:33.907]  I'm out barbecuing with the family.
[01:00:33.907 --> 01:00:34.507]  I'm a cupcake.
[01:00:36.263 --> 01:00:44.406]  But when I read about how they put fluoride in the water to brain damage us and create cancer and lower fertility in their own documents.
[01:00:44.406 --> 01:00:50.828]  When I sit here and realize they're funding ISIS and Al Qaeda to run around murdering Christians everywhere and make them pay Islam taxes.
[01:00:50.828 --> 01:00:58.031]  There's not one word out of the stinking controlled left media that dreams of having their daughters sexually mutilated by jihadis.
[01:00:58.031 --> 01:00:58.651]  Literally.
[01:00:58.651 --> 01:01:00.152]  They have a fetish for it.
[01:01:00.152 --> 01:01:00.752]  It's cuckolding.
[01:01:03.234 --> 01:01:08.095]  They don't like the real liberal culture of the West that gave them the right to run around and do all this stuff.
[01:01:08.095 --> 01:01:10.275]  They just want to destroy it.
[01:01:10.275 --> 01:01:15.076]  Like, mount its head on the wall, even though it's their head.
[01:01:15.076 --> 01:01:18.857]  It's a payback.
[01:01:18.857 --> 01:01:30.039]  What's the Egyptian legend of the one demigod that goes after his father because he thinks he's doing evil until he finally gets in the position of power and then realizes that
[01:01:31.328 --> 01:01:32.589]  The end justifies the means.
[01:01:32.589 --> 01:01:37.893]  It's all just fraudulent thought processes.
[01:01:37.893 --> 01:01:43.938]  But I take ownership and empathize with all the innocents being murdered by the globalists and all the crises they're creating.
[01:01:43.938 --> 01:01:50.283]  And I want to do something about it, not just look at the end result that they'll show us and then say, give us more power.
[01:01:50.283 --> 01:01:56.788]  I look at how they engineered it, and at a fundamental cellular level, I get upset about it.
[01:01:58.547 --> 01:02:01.068]  And I know you resonate as well.
[01:02:01.068 --> 01:02:07.089]  This is setting brush fires in the minds of men, to quote Thomas Jefferson.
[01:02:07.089 --> 01:02:12.450]  Finland to raise taxes on the wealthy, even though they already have like an 80 plus percent tax, to cover refugee costs.
[01:02:12.450 --> 01:02:14.431]  Please print that little jewel for me.
[01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:23.613]  That's a little bit less intrusive than Sweden saying they're going to make people house the jihadis in your house.
[01:02:23.613 --> 01:02:28.014]  And they're telling Germans, German women don't wear short skirts anymore.
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:34.921]  Oh man, I tell you.
[01:02:34.921 --> 01:02:41.263]  You talk about a death wish.
[01:02:41.263 --> 01:02:47.465]  But see, the criminals that run Europe that have hijacked it can get away with this, they can get away with anything.
[01:02:47.465 --> 01:02:54.568]  So it's not just a fetish to smear garbage all over Europe.
[01:02:54.568 --> 01:02:58.749]  I got stacks of articles of women being pulled out of cars, raped, children being raped.
[01:02:58.749 --> 01:03:01.130]  They're like, well that's part of the radical Islamic culture.
[01:03:02.011 --> 01:03:05.492]  To rape your daughter.
[01:03:05.492 --> 01:03:13.014]  You see, they're kicking out of their countries, their poorest, their most criminal, their most degenerate, their most mentally ill.
[01:03:13.014 --> 01:03:20.476]  And a bunch of 18-year-old, 20-year-old troublemaker crooks and ISIS people that folks don't want in their countries anymore.
[01:03:20.476 --> 01:03:26.818]  We have them posting on their Facebook, I'm here, I'm in Berlin, look at me, I'm a jihadi, I fought, I cut a bunch of Christians' heads off.
[01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:29.091]  Come hang out with me, ladies!
[01:03:45.467 --> 01:03:46.868]  Uh, by a radical jihadi.
[01:03:46.868 --> 01:03:54.914]  I mean, they got all these women, teenagers, all over the world getting on airplanes and flooding to go be in dirt shacks and raped by over a hundred men.
[01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:58.256]  Then, of course, they're begging for mommy and daddy after, but that doesn't happen.
[01:03:58.256 --> 01:04:00.978]  You just get taken out in the field and shot in the back of the head.
[01:04:00.978 --> 01:04:01.878]  But it's so liberal!
[01:04:01.878 --> 01:04:03.019]  Gloria Steinem loves it!
[01:04:03.019 --> 01:04:04.060]  And so does Rachel Maddow!
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:18.511]  Hey Rachel Maddow, why don't you go over there and hang out with your little jihadi pals that little CIA Anderson Cooper promoted in the last four years as the Arab Spring run by the filthy White House.
[01:04:18.511 --> 01:04:29.521]  They just want to commit so many crimes openly and move the Overton window of learned helplessness and mass Stockholm Syndrome
[01:04:30.987 --> 01:04:39.552]  To a new normalcy bias that accepts anything these evil, sick freaks want to carry out.
[01:04:39.552 --> 01:04:43.414]  And you notice I've turned my rhetoric way up because I'm not going to mince words anymore.
[01:04:43.414 --> 01:04:48.196]  These people are unmitigated evil.
[01:04:48.196 --> 01:04:49.337]  I mean, I'm telling you, I've been around them.
[01:04:49.337 --> 01:04:52.358]  They want to hurt you and your family.
[01:04:52.358 --> 01:04:53.139]  You understand that?
[01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:55.180]  I mean, they are conquering us.
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:55.680]  And you know what?
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:56.481]  They are our rulers.
[01:04:59.141 --> 01:05:03.803]  Will Donald Trump sign the GOP pledge precluding a third-party run?
[01:05:03.803 --> 01:05:13.806]  According to a close associate, the GOP candidate intends to sign the loyalty pledge that would bind him to endorse the Republican nominee and would preclude him a third-party run.
[01:05:13.806 --> 01:05:24.470]  The Republican National Committee has made it clear that they want every candidate running for nomination to sign a pledge not to break off and run as a third-party candidate under any circumstances.
[01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:32.553]  The GOP is worried that third-party campaigns will jeopardize the party's chances against the eventual Democratic presidential candidate.
[01:05:32.553 --> 01:05:41.357]  And as he's currently the most popular candidate, the GOP is concerned that Donald Trump may break off from the pact, and he has repeatedly threatened to do so.
[01:05:41.357 --> 01:05:51.461]  Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul reminded everyone that it was Ross Perot who ended up giving us the first Clinton, and if Trump breaks off, he could give us another Clinton.

[01:06:58.855 --> 01:07:02.937]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[01:07:02.937 --> 01:07:16.302]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world so prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[01:07:16.442 --> 01:07:25.609]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[01:07:25.609 --> 01:07:27.110]  This is the good halogen.
[01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:30.173]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[01:07:30.173 --> 01:07:42.202]  Now we at InfoWarsLife.com are bringing you the only source of clean, pure, 99.99 Ultra Pure Deep Earth Crystals from more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:07:42.202 --> 01:07:43.463]  Watch the informational videos
[01:07:43.663 --> 01:07:50.088]  At Infowarslife.com, discover how transformational pure iodine can be for you and your family.
[01:07:50.088 --> 01:07:51.149]  Folks, this isn't hype.
[01:07:51.149 --> 01:08:02.098]  Read the reviews for yourself at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:08:02.098 --> 01:08:08.744]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.744 --> 01:08:11.727]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:30.836 --> 01:08:42.360]  When you are faced with scientifically crafted evil, when you are faced with social engineering, you cannot defeat it by arguing within its paradigm.
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:48.122]  You must transcend its paradigm and expose the fact that it's an artificial construct.
[01:08:48.122 --> 01:08:49.623]  It'd be like if they raised a baby.
[01:08:51.929 --> 01:08:55.490]  Some of the fathers of modern psychology did things like this.
[01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:57.991]  They would do it inside a box.
[01:08:57.991 --> 01:09:02.432]  Their own children to torture them and to test mind control.
[01:09:02.432 --> 01:09:13.475]  But imagine a baby growing up in an artificial house that was TV screens on the walls, that was an artificial reality with basically a robot that instructed the child and fed it.
[01:09:15.765 --> 01:09:21.328]  That person wouldn't know what planet they were on after 18 years inside that box.
[01:09:21.328 --> 01:09:26.611]  You could make them believe that they were a squid creature from Pluto.
[01:09:26.611 --> 01:09:42.840]  And basically, by increment, by successive approximation, by gradualism, we're being inserted into a giant panopticonic system that I call a proto-matrix.
[01:09:48.823 --> 01:09:59.485]  And I talked about a American Federation of Science report document that was declassified in 2000, reclassified in 2001.
[01:09:59.485 --> 01:10:06.347]  I put excerpts of it in my book, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:10:06.347 --> 01:10:15.409]  The film was Road to Tyranny, the book is Descent into Tyranny.
[01:10:15.409 --> 01:10:16.649]  Where they talked about
[01:10:21.192 --> 01:10:42.866]  Ending human consciousness basically as we know it and having us hook up to machines and living inside stasis pods similar to what you'd use in space travel for suspended animation to end all war and to have the biosphere funded off of our own heat.
[01:10:45.762 --> 01:10:54.308]  And that we would be fed intravenously by factories basically run by robots.
[01:10:54.308 --> 01:10:56.250]  And you go, wait, I've seen that before.
[01:10:56.250 --> 01:10:59.452]  It's called the Matrix that came out like in 1998, 1999.
[01:10:59.452 --> 01:11:05.797]  Now, I'm not saying they'll ever get us to that point.
[01:11:05.797 --> 01:11:09.039]  And that was just DARPA back in the 70s.
[01:11:09.039 --> 01:11:11.061]  Theorizing about a perfect world.
[01:11:12.076 --> 01:11:18.902]  These are mad scientists, and again, they've crossed humans with animals, animals with insects.
[01:11:18.902 --> 01:11:26.348]  They have thousands of crops that are pharmacological, where corn can produce any chemical or biological agent they want.
[01:11:26.348 --> 01:11:31.171]  I mean, we're in Prometheus.
[01:11:31.171 --> 01:11:34.954]  We have the fire of the gods.
[01:11:34.954 --> 01:11:37.937]  But the future is not evenly distributed.
[01:11:40.325 --> 01:11:46.768]  And so while we're thinking the number one issue is Caitlyn Jenner, I mean, could it at least be a good-looking tranny?
[01:11:46.768 --> 01:11:54.731]  I mean, you know, it's just, I mean, it is the most ridiculous garbage you could ever imagine.
[01:11:54.731 --> 01:12:02.214]  But if they can make us make that the national consciousness, we're not going to notice that half our neighbors have got cancer.
[01:12:04.090 --> 01:12:15.437]  We're not going to notice that Planned Parenthood is selling baby body parts and groups connected with it have been caught keeping babies alive and then harvesting them.
[01:12:15.437 --> 01:12:20.180]  And then the conscience is so seared and people are so selfish, they're like, I don't care!
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:23.582]  As if you get ahead by not caring.
[01:12:23.582 --> 01:12:24.543]  The good news is,
[01:12:26.107 --> 01:12:32.271]  Even if these hearings coming up in Congress doesn't defund it, the states are defunding Planned Parenthood.
[01:12:32.271 --> 01:12:33.992]  It's being exposed for what it is.
[01:12:33.992 --> 01:12:37.233]  The whole Margaret Sanger narrative is coming out.
[01:12:37.233 --> 01:12:43.277]  A lot of the left is waking up and really looking at their roots and understanding what's really happened.
[01:12:44.525 --> 01:12:48.888]  And there'll be more infiltrations, if not by this group, others.
[01:12:48.888 --> 01:13:01.536]  And as the type of investigative, hardcore journalism takes root that we've engaged in, that Veritas Project is engaged in, and others have engaged in, it will be the beginning of the end of these people.
[01:13:01.536 --> 01:13:02.696]  And the polls show it!
[01:13:02.696 --> 01:13:06.959]  Roe v. Wade, blob of tissue, 65-70% were for abortion in 1974, the year after Roe v. Wade.
[01:13:20.012 --> 01:13:22.993]  Now it's upwards of 70% are against abortion.
[01:13:22.993 --> 01:13:24.094]  The numbers have flipped.
[01:13:24.094 --> 01:13:26.955]  Again, we're gaining ground.
[01:13:26.955 --> 01:13:35.239]  But you have to see the horror of the little baby fighting for its life, about to be chopped up, about to be dissected.
[01:13:35.239 --> 01:13:37.140]  Is it okay because it's Planned Parenthood?
[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:38.700]  What if it was Jeffrey Dahmer doing it?
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:39.841]  Then would it be bad?
[01:13:39.841 --> 01:13:43.583]  What if it was a big green spider sucking a baby dry?
[01:13:43.583 --> 01:13:45.283]  Then it'd be horrific, wouldn't it?
[01:13:45.283 --> 01:13:46.364]  It'd be a horror movie.
[01:13:50.711 --> 01:13:53.052]  But because it's our own people doing it.
[01:13:53.052 --> 01:13:54.412]  Oh, it's okay.
[01:13:54.412 --> 01:13:58.353]  See, because they've made it all about women's rights.
[01:13:58.353 --> 01:14:07.716]  Just like it broke a year and a half ago that the vets are on a don't treat list and are having care rationed by a IBM computer called Thomas.
[01:14:07.716 --> 01:14:10.637]  Thomas Watson.
[01:14:10.637 --> 01:14:16.519]  The guy that ran the Third Reich's extermination program from New York City.
[01:14:16.519 --> 01:14:20.220]  Who received the highest award in Germany that no one else but him got.
[01:14:22.432 --> 01:14:25.996]  Because Hitler was a project of the elites in this country.
[01:14:25.996 --> 01:14:27.337]  And they set Hitler up.
[01:14:27.337 --> 01:14:29.479]  Hitler was not good, by the way.
[01:14:29.479 --> 01:14:35.325]  But it's beyond what they tell you.
[01:14:35.325 --> 01:14:42.311]  Roosevelt wouldn't take the Jews because the liberal Jewish groups in New York City
[01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:47.333]  Said they hadn't paid a ransom to them to get out.
[01:14:47.333 --> 01:14:52.096]  And I've had Dr. Pachinikon, who was a Jew who lost family in Europe when they fled to Cuba.
[01:14:52.096 --> 01:15:04.704]  They fled to Cuba on a boat right after he was born because New York City wouldn't take him because the Jews said, you didn't pay up.
[01:15:04.704 --> 01:15:06.425]  Oh, is it anti-Semitic that I don't want to kill Jews?
[01:15:06.425 --> 01:15:07.186]  I guess it is, isn't it?
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.722]  If I was a real Nazi collaborator, then it would be okay.
[01:15:10.722 --> 01:15:17.146]  If I was George Soros or Arnold Schwarzenegger that wears Nazi uniforms and says he wants to be Hitler, that's okay.
[01:15:17.146 --> 01:15:33.157]  But if I point out that the evil, corrupt people like George Soros, who was involved then, the people above him, robbed the Jews and sucked off the Jews and told them, you either pay a ransom or you go to Israel.
[01:15:33.157 --> 01:15:36.240]  And then when they said, okay, we'll go to Israel, they said, still, you're going to pay a ransom.
[01:15:37.253 --> 01:15:42.416]  The average ransom calculates up to one million dollars today.
[01:15:42.416 --> 01:15:48.961]  And all the poor Jews, or the middle class Jews, that didn't have it, they got sent to be murdered.
[01:15:48.961 --> 01:16:01.449]  And then the very Jews that helped murder them, sit around and create a Holocaust narrative, and project it on as guilt onto the American people, as the national narrative, as if we were involved in it.
[01:16:01.449 --> 01:16:06.592]  As if the average American that fought Hitler, or whose grandfathers fought Hitler, was bad.
[01:16:07.932 --> 01:16:16.536]  So we have to let that same Jewish mafia that helped kill the Jews with Hitler engage in all these criminal activities, or we're anti-Semitic?
[01:16:16.536 --> 01:16:23.879]  I say feel your hand, Nazi-loving scum, and go straight to hell where you came from.
[01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:25.619]  You're opportunistic criminals.
[01:16:25.619 --> 01:16:27.020]  You're not Jews.
[01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:28.961]  You're an organized crime syndicate.
[01:16:30.228 --> 01:16:33.849]  ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, all of you groups.
[01:16:33.849 --> 01:16:35.610]  No more holding back, folks.
[01:16:35.610 --> 01:16:37.331]  No more holding back.
[01:16:37.331 --> 01:16:39.291]  My family fought the Nazis.
[01:16:39.291 --> 01:16:42.433]  You helped them.
[01:16:42.433 --> 01:16:44.453]  You won't go after real Nazis.
[01:16:44.453 --> 01:16:45.654]  You protect them.
[01:16:45.654 --> 01:16:48.375]  You're scum!
[01:16:48.375 --> 01:16:51.216]  You're filth!
[01:16:51.216 --> 01:16:54.297]  You're criminals!
[01:16:54.297 --> 01:16:56.978]  Now let's go to the good news here.
[01:16:56.978 --> 01:16:58.839]  Congress starts Planned Parenthood hearings.
[01:16:58.839 --> 01:16:59.259]  Here it is.
[01:17:01.363 --> 01:17:10.730]  Recently, the nation's attention has been drawn to a series of undercover videos recorded by members of a group called the Center for Medical Progress.
[01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:22.979]  These videos contain discussions with representatives of the abortion-providing organization Planned Parenthood regarding the exchange of money for the body parts of unborn children to be used in research.
[01:17:23.729 --> 01:17:32.231]  I'm here today to share my story to not only highlight the horror of abortion taking place at Planned Parenthood, but to give a voice to other survivors like me.
[01:17:32.231 --> 01:17:41.673]  And most importantly, to give a name, a face, and a voice to the hundreds of thousands of children who will have their lives ended by Planned Parenthood this year alone.
[01:17:41.673 --> 01:17:47.835]  Planned Parenthood has been a specific target of many of these types of attacks, and just since the year 2000,
[01:17:49.315 --> 01:17:57.962]  They've been the target of nine similar smear campaigns using hidden videos or other recordings full of innuendo and false claims.
[01:17:57.962 --> 01:18:03.587]  Every single time, these allegations have been thoroughly investigated and debunked.
[01:18:03.587 --> 01:18:07.791]  I loved Ricky Nelson and Ozzie, but their history, it's gone.
[01:18:07.791 --> 01:18:08.952]  It's a new America.
[01:18:08.952 --> 01:18:12.635]  And this hearing is about eliminating and overruling Roe v. Wade.
[01:18:14.082 --> 01:18:16.244]  I say fund Planned Parenthood.
[01:18:16.244 --> 01:18:18.666]  It doesn't deliver abortions with federal funds.
[01:18:18.666 --> 01:18:23.950]  This hearing is about abortion and I support Roe v. Wade.
[01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:29.214]  Another lie from Mr. Cohen.
[01:18:29.214 --> 01:18:32.036]  Planned Parenthood's on record getting federal funds for abortion.
[01:18:32.036 --> 01:18:39.342]  Travis County, where this broadcast comes to you from, is the only county in Texas that takes taxpayer money and pays for women's abortions.
[01:18:41.906 --> 01:18:50.934]  That upset me so much I moved to Hayes County when they did it.
[01:18:50.934 --> 01:18:52.696]  But that's how evil these people are.
[01:18:52.696 --> 01:19:04.887]  They will sit there and lie straight to your face and all they are, whether they be black, white, German, Jewish, Chinese, Mexican, is an evil group of people working together through fraud against the rest of us.
[01:19:06.397 --> 01:19:09.520]  And it's time to expose what's happening and not be cowardly.
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:14.644]  And really be retrospective and ask which side we want to be on.
[01:19:14.644 --> 01:19:20.430]  Now coming up after the break, abortion survivor gives powerful testimony before Congress.
[01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:21.210]  Gina Jessen.
[01:19:21.210 --> 01:19:25.855]  We're going to play part of that when we return straight ahead.
[01:19:25.855 --> 01:19:31.980]  But if I'm being particularly nasty today, it's because what the New World Order is doing is nasty.
[01:19:35.683 --> 01:19:49.366]  And we don't have any hope of countering what's happening with the globalists if we don't expose exactly what's going on and exactly what's happening.
[01:19:49.366 --> 01:19:55.447]  Now, when is the ADL going to attack George Soros and Arnold Schwarzenegger?
[01:19:55.447 --> 01:19:57.808]  Because those people are real evil.
[01:19:59.301 --> 01:20:04.504]  Turn on the news and you'll hear stories of natural disasters, political unrest, and financial crisis.
[01:20:04.504 --> 01:20:08.487]  In times of uncertainty, how will you take care of your family's most basic needs?

[01:21:28.726 --> 01:21:29.470]  Okay.
[01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:30.756]  Open your mouth and say, ah.
[01:21:30.756 --> 01:21:30.797]  Ah.
[01:21:31.977 --> 01:21:34.639]  When your child has a sore throat, you need to know when to get help.
[01:21:34.639 --> 01:21:36.020]  The doctor recommended Say Ah!

[01:21:55.453 --> 01:21:58.355]  The new mainstay for every family's first aid kit.
[01:21:58.355 --> 01:22:01.777]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:02.558 --> 01:22:03.198]  It's true.
[01:22:03.198 --> 01:22:07.343]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:07.343 --> 01:22:09.745]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:09.745 --> 01:22:14.531]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:14.531 --> 01:22:21.899]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA.

[01:24:02.626 --> 01:24:08.149]  Coming up, Finland to raise taxes on the wealthy to cover refugee costs for Reuters.
[01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:10.830]  Gruber's being paid off for his lies.
[01:24:10.830 --> 01:24:16.353]  College students nationwide assign public finance textbooks that cost over $100.
[01:24:16.353 --> 01:24:17.714]  Written by Jonathan Gruber.
[01:24:18.877 --> 01:24:26.965]  So, millions of people got to buy a textbook written by a guy that teaches you how to lie to the gullible, stupid American people.
[01:24:26.965 --> 01:24:30.608]  The ones they couldn't chop up when they were little kids.
[01:24:30.608 --> 01:24:35.613]  So funny how dumb everyone is to be preyed on by a nice liberal.
[01:24:35.613 --> 01:24:43.560]  Maybe the new textbook teaches us 2 plus 2 equals 5 and Gruber says so because he controls reality.
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:44.561]  Let's go to this video.
[01:24:48.137 --> 01:24:51.581]  Gianna Jessen, one of many people that was dug out of a trash can.
[01:24:51.581 --> 01:24:54.324]  It's a 6 minute, 55 minute testimony to Congress.
[01:24:54.324 --> 01:24:56.586]  We're going to play some of this right now.
[01:24:56.586 --> 01:24:57.447]  The rest of it later.
[01:24:57.447 --> 01:24:59.349]  The video is on InfoWars.com.
[01:24:59.349 --> 01:25:00.951]  Here it is.
[01:25:00.951 --> 01:25:02.372]  Good morning.
[01:25:02.372 --> 01:25:08.059]  My name is Gianna Jessen and I would like to thank you so much for the opportunity to testify here today.
[01:25:09.258 --> 01:25:22.025]  My biological mother was seven and a half months pregnant when she went to a Planned Parenthood and was advised, and they advised her to have a late-term saline abortion.
[01:25:22.025 --> 01:25:32.131]  This method of abortion burns the baby inside and out, blinding and suffocating the child, who is then born dead, usually within 24 hours.
[01:25:32.131 --> 01:25:35.113]  And there should be a photo there.
[01:25:35.113 --> 01:25:37.294]  Yes, this is what I survived.
[01:25:39.847 --> 01:25:54.451]  Instead of dying, after 18 hours of being burned in my mother's womb, I was delivered alive in an abortion clinic in Los Angeles on April the 6th, 1977.
[01:25:54.451 --> 01:25:59.972]  You can see a photo as well of my medical records.
[01:25:59.972 --> 01:26:04.974]  My medical records state, born alive during saline abortion, 6 AM.
[01:26:04.974 --> 01:26:05.594]  Ha!
[01:26:05.594 --> 01:26:08.735]  Yeah, now they just kill you, even though it's illegal.
[01:26:09.909 --> 01:26:13.032]  Thankfully, the abortionist was not at work yet.
[01:26:13.032 --> 01:26:19.157]  Had he been there, he would have ended my life with strangulation, suffocation, or leaving me there to die.
[01:26:19.157 --> 01:26:22.720]  Instead, a nurse called an ambulance.
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:24.021]  What an extremist.
[01:26:24.021 --> 01:26:26.203]  And I was rushed to a hospital.
[01:26:26.203 --> 01:26:28.725]  Doctors did not expect me to live.
[01:26:28.725 --> 01:26:29.085]  I did.
[01:26:29.085 --> 01:26:29.586]  Pause.
[01:26:31.741 --> 01:26:32.962]  And back it up 10 seconds.
[01:26:32.962 --> 01:26:39.104]  Now, if you're a preemie, they give you the full vaccine battery and the nurses say it's killing the babies.
[01:26:39.104 --> 01:26:43.365]  And they go, hospital orders, prime directive, Thomas Watson computer.
[01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:44.046]  That's in the news.
[01:26:44.046 --> 01:26:47.667]  That's who now, most big bioethics boards are no longer men and women.
[01:26:47.667 --> 01:26:49.108]  They don't want to actually do the killing.
[01:26:49.108 --> 01:26:51.548]  So the machine says, administer shots.
[01:26:51.548 --> 01:26:57.231]  And then the women battle, mainly women nurses, with the respirators, with the defibrillators.
[01:26:57.231 --> 01:26:58.191]  And they give the injections.
[01:26:58.191 --> 01:26:59.071]  The babies start dying.
[01:26:59.071 --> 01:27:00.732]  They go into full battle mode to keep them alive.
[01:27:01.132 --> 01:27:01.713]  Yes, sir!
[01:27:01.713 --> 01:27:03.394]  Prepare injections!
[01:27:03.394 --> 01:27:03.735]  Murder!
[01:27:03.735 --> 01:27:03.995]  Murder!
[01:27:03.995 --> 01:27:04.295]  Murder!
[01:27:04.295 --> 01:27:04.575]  Murder!
[01:27:04.575 --> 01:27:04.856]  Murder!
[01:27:04.856 --> 01:27:05.156]  Murder!
[01:27:05.156 --> 01:27:05.917]  Murder!
[01:27:05.917 --> 01:27:07.878]  And then they put the respirators on them.
[01:27:07.878 --> 01:27:09.860]  It's just such a sick joke!
[01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:10.321]  Ha ha!
[01:27:10.321 --> 01:27:12.243]  They're murdering everyone and they love it!
[01:27:12.243 --> 01:27:14.184]  The public loves it!
[01:27:14.184 --> 01:27:15.365]  Oh, take all your shots.
[01:27:15.365 --> 01:27:18.008]  All of you that serve the system, just keep believing in it.
[01:27:18.008 --> 01:27:20.030]  They're going to saw your legs off with diabetes.
[01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:21.892]  They're going to kill you with fluoride.
[01:27:21.892 --> 01:27:22.893]  They're going to murder you.
[01:27:23.393 --> 01:27:24.974]  People say, man, why are you so hardcore?
[01:27:24.974 --> 01:27:26.074]  Because it's true.
[01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:27.615]  Because I see it.
[01:27:27.615 --> 01:27:30.116]  I accept the evil and then resist it.
[01:27:30.116 --> 01:27:32.457]  I accept it's happening.
[01:27:32.457 --> 01:27:33.957]  I don't accept it itself.
[01:27:33.957 --> 01:27:41.720]  I say no, but I accept reality.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:46.342]  By the way, it's illegal to kill a baby once they're born, but they'd still do it.
[01:27:46.342 --> 01:27:47.783]  Let's continue with our testimony.
[01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:52.755]  My life was strangulation, suffocation, or leaving me there to die.
[01:27:52.755 --> 01:27:53.335]  Liberalation.
[01:27:53.335 --> 01:27:55.799]  Instead, a nurse called an ambulance.
[01:27:55.799 --> 01:27:58.162]  Oh, terror.
[01:27:58.162 --> 01:28:00.325]  And I was rushed to a hospital.
[01:28:00.325 --> 01:28:02.167]  Doctors did not expect me to live.
[01:28:02.167 --> 01:28:03.409]  Yeah, now she'd be killed by that shame.
[01:28:03.409 --> 01:28:03.509]  I did.
[01:28:04.815 --> 01:28:11.623]  I was later diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy, which was caused by a lack of oxygen to my brain while surviving an abortion.
[01:28:11.623 --> 01:28:14.906]  I was never supposed to hold up my head or walk.
[01:28:14.906 --> 01:28:15.247]  I do.
[01:28:15.247 --> 01:28:17.149]  Oh, how dare you!
[01:28:17.149 --> 01:28:21.574]  And Cerebral Palsy, ladies and gentlemen, is a tremendous gift to me.
[01:28:24.079 --> 01:28:28.062]  I was eventually placed in foster care and later adopted.
[01:28:28.062 --> 01:28:32.365]  And hear me clearly, I forgive my biological mother.
[01:28:32.365 --> 01:28:34.186]  Oh, how horrible!
[01:28:34.186 --> 01:28:44.554]  Within the first year after my birth, I was used as an expert witness in a case where an abortionist had been caught strangling a child to death after being born alive.
[01:28:44.554 --> 01:28:46.916]  Had been caught loving them.
[01:28:46.916 --> 01:28:51.219]  Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, said the following.
[01:28:52.267 --> 01:29:00.092]  The most merciful thing that a large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it.
[01:29:00.092 --> 01:29:01.253]  Awww.
[01:29:01.253 --> 01:29:02.193]  You will die.
[01:29:02.193 --> 01:29:06.056]  Planned Parenthood is not ashamed of what they have done or continue to do.
[01:29:07.062 --> 01:29:17.468]  But we will have to give an account as a nation before God for our apathy and for the murder of over 50 million children in the womb.
[01:29:17.468 --> 01:29:19.370]  The sacrifice, you mean?
[01:29:19.370 --> 01:29:29.056]  Every time we falter in courage as individuals and fail to confront this evil, I wonder how many lives have been lost in our silence.
[01:29:29.056 --> 01:29:29.416]  We'll be back.
[01:29:31.701 --> 01:29:34.062]  We're going to play more of this later when we come back.
[01:29:34.062 --> 01:29:36.583]  We have a special guest joining us with some key intel.
[01:29:36.583 --> 01:29:38.363]  Then all the news I've been mentioning I'm going to get to.
[01:29:38.363 --> 01:29:45.866]  But the truth is, this is like therapy for me to be in all this satire because this really upsets me.
[01:29:45.866 --> 01:29:47.206]  And I know it upsets you as well.
[01:29:47.206 --> 01:29:48.227]  We're going to stop these people.
[01:29:48.227 --> 01:29:48.787]  Stay with us.
[01:29:48.787 --> 01:29:50.047]  Humanity is rising.
[01:29:50.047 --> 01:29:52.588]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.588 --> 01:29:55.249]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.471 --> 01:30:01.793]  Do you know what it means to be an American?
[01:30:01.793 --> 01:30:03.274]  It's more than a flag.
[01:30:03.274 --> 01:30:06.136]  It's more than knowing the star-spangled banner.
[01:30:06.136 --> 01:30:07.737]  It's knowing the Constitution.
[01:30:07.737 --> 01:30:10.819]  It's understanding those rights and fighting for them.
[01:30:10.819 --> 01:30:17.643]  Our country is falling apart because people have forgotten to fight, to stand up in the face of tyranny and do the right thing.
[01:30:17.643 --> 01:30:20.105]  It's putting your life on the line to protect your country.
[01:30:20.265 --> 01:30:22.746]  from enemies both foreign and domestic.
[01:30:22.746 --> 01:30:30.950]  The Bill of Rights is what the people are entitled to against every government and no government should refuse or rest on inference.
[01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:35.933]  So the Tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[01:30:36.773 --> 01:30:41.697]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com, and I believe our flag is more than cloth and ink.
[01:30:41.697 --> 01:30:44.759]  It is a symbol that stands for liberty and freedom.
[01:30:44.759 --> 01:30:49.923]  It is the history of our nation, and it's marked by the blood of those who died defending it.
[01:30:49.923 --> 01:30:51.644]  So join me in this Infowar.
[01:30:51.644 --> 01:30:56.108]  Turn off your TV, put your Cheetos down, get off your butt and join the resistance.

[01:31:56.964 --> 01:32:02.691]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:32:02.691 --> 01:32:07.597]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:32:07.637 --> 01:32:07.977]  I don't know.
[01:32:29.208 --> 01:32:33.570]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[01:32:33.570 --> 01:32:37.732]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.

[01:33:25.279 --> 01:33:36.666]  You notice just more and more of the over-the-top horrific stuff's coming out, and then people wake up, they say no, and then the evil stops or gets reduced.
[01:33:36.666 --> 01:33:44.631]  That's why the corrupt always say, stop being negative, stop being gloom and doom, stop talking about unseemly things that are happening.
[01:33:44.631 --> 01:33:49.454]  Crow-lifers, don't go stand in front of abortuaries with images of chopped up babies.
[01:33:49.454 --> 01:33:50.114]  It's mean!
[01:33:51.343 --> 01:33:51.964]  Oh, really?
[01:33:51.964 --> 01:33:55.626]  No, it's exposing what you're doing.
[01:33:55.626 --> 01:33:57.167]  It's beating you.
[01:33:57.167 --> 01:33:57.807]  So, you know what?
[01:33:57.807 --> 01:33:59.429]  I'm not going to listen to your advice.
[01:33:59.429 --> 01:34:00.930]  Oh, politically be nice.
[01:34:00.930 --> 01:34:02.611]  Politically be milquetoast.
[01:34:02.611 --> 01:34:04.872]  Follow talking points.
[01:34:04.872 --> 01:34:06.193]  That's how you get ahead.
[01:34:06.193 --> 01:34:09.195]  No, that's how you beat us in fake debates.
[01:34:09.195 --> 01:34:11.096]  Scum.
[01:34:11.096 --> 01:34:13.578]  And I'm talking to the establishment.
[01:34:13.578 --> 01:34:16.200]  So, Alice Cooper's got a song.
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:17.981]  No more Mr. Nice Guy.
[01:34:17.981 --> 01:34:19.182]  No more Mr. Clean.
[01:34:24.890 --> 01:34:43.361]  So, coming up, Saudi Arabia has 100,000 air-conditioned tents that can house 3 million people already set up, sitting empty, yet has taken zero
[01:34:44.508 --> 01:34:59.443]  Refugees, while they lobby through Al Jazeera TV, I saw this last night monitoring it, that the West should do more for the millions, 800,000 this year, that have shown up in Germany.
[01:34:59.443 --> 01:35:02.946]  800,000 in a country of 75 million.
[01:35:02.946 --> 01:35:07.210]  That's already like a third, you know, third world.
[01:35:07.210 --> 01:35:07.570]  Or more.
[01:35:08.686 --> 01:35:28.520]  Just showing up and carjacking and robbing and raping and filled with weird socialist wealth redistribution ideology that fits in perfectly with the socialist and communist parties to totally take over.
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:33.623]  And that ties in with Finland to raise taxes on the wealthy to cover refugee costs.
[01:35:33.623 --> 01:35:35.465]  That's Yahoo News Reuters.
[01:35:38.938 --> 01:35:39.899]  Oh my goodness.
[01:35:39.899 --> 01:35:47.366]  And there's other corporate welfare universities make finance students nationwide by Jonathan Gruber's textbook.
[01:35:47.366 --> 01:35:49.808]  That's the guy that said the public's dumb, thank God.
[01:35:49.808 --> 01:35:52.671]  Yeah, Obamacare doubles or triple cost.
[01:35:52.671 --> 01:35:56.614]  We had to hide that, so I figured out the plan to lie and Obama adopted it.
[01:35:56.614 --> 01:36:01.098]  Two plus two equals five.
[01:36:01.098 --> 01:36:04.081]  Again, it's just the cold-hearted evil of these people.
[01:36:08.723 --> 01:36:21.290]  After we cover that, the really big news, one year, 6,700 airstrikes, and $4 billion after Obama vowed to destroy ISIS, Jihad is still on the offensive taking over.
[01:36:21.290 --> 01:36:30.216]  And that dovetails with 50 spies go public, Steve Watson article, and say we're basically protecting ISIS.
[01:36:30.216 --> 01:36:32.357]  And we're forced to put out fake intelligence reports.
[01:36:35.385 --> 01:36:45.217]  It is bold, man, for our own government to fund ISIS and Al-Qaeda, and now they admit they're streaming into Europe with the refugees, many of which are victims of their own evil.
[01:36:45.217 --> 01:36:48.842]  And I feel for some of the refugees, but politically they're being used as a weapon.
[01:36:48.842 --> 01:36:52.687]  The globalists are doing this on purpose.
[01:37:03.404 --> 01:37:09.766]  We're going to go to our guest, Steve Wetzel, here in just a moment, who I asked to come on the show.
[01:37:09.766 --> 01:37:12.446]  I've been in talks with these folks.
[01:37:12.446 --> 01:37:16.027]  We're going to spend about 10 minutes on this and then get back into the news.
[01:37:16.027 --> 01:37:18.528]  I've been in talks.
[01:37:18.528 --> 01:37:21.048]  Well, they've been a sponsor for four years.
[01:37:21.048 --> 01:37:21.848]  Three, four years.
[01:37:21.848 --> 01:37:23.849]  But I've been in talks for two years to do this.
[01:37:26.756 --> 01:37:29.879]  And finally, we got it all done.
[01:37:29.879 --> 01:37:39.388]  I'll be honest with you, I went out and talked to some of the other top providers and they just couldn't provide something as good as as low a cost that was as high quality.
[01:37:39.388 --> 01:37:44.553]  Because I believe in treating people like I want to be treated, the golden rule.
[01:37:44.553 --> 01:37:46.375]  Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you.
[01:37:48.687 --> 01:37:50.408]  And plus free market.
[01:37:50.408 --> 01:37:59.934]  If I sold cars, I want to be a really good brand of car that didn't have a lot of problems, so you were happy and came back in four years, bought another car from me.
[01:37:59.934 --> 01:38:13.762]  And finally, when the storable foods market exploded again a few months ago with the meltdown accelerating with China, with the situation in Europe, with the refugee crisis, with governments hoarding food, I called up My Patriot Supply.
[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:32.343]  And I said, you know, we talked for the last two years, of you being sponsors for three, about putting out InfoWars Select, which is your full spectrum of foods, but packaged with our labeling, and then giving us the lowest price you offer anybody.
[01:38:32.343 --> 01:38:39.965]  And by the way, they gave us a price so low, if we chose, because we don't make a huge profit on it, but I think we'll just sell more and make a bigger profit and fund our operation.
[01:38:39.965 --> 01:38:41.365]  That's how capitalism works.
[01:38:41.365 --> 01:38:45.546]  That it's even lower than their prices at MyPatriotSupply, who are sponsors.
[01:38:46.348 --> 01:38:47.629]  We sell their full spectrum.
[01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:51.231]  You can see it at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:38:51.231 --> 01:38:53.572]  We left the MyPatriot stuff up there because it's excellent.
[01:38:53.572 --> 01:38:58.935]  It's only a little bit more than Infowars Select that is in the same patented tote.
[01:38:58.935 --> 01:39:04.539]  I mean, you know, at Walmart or Target, just the containers almost cost as much as the stuff does with the food.
[01:39:04.539 --> 01:39:07.701]  But they buy them in mass, so they're very inexpensive.
[01:39:07.701 --> 01:39:09.602]  And I want to go over in this segment
[01:39:10.717 --> 01:39:14.843]  Why it's so good and why people should get prepared.
[01:39:14.843 --> 01:39:17.246]  But basically it's drop ship right from their factory.
[01:39:17.246 --> 01:39:18.468]  It is.
[01:39:22.383 --> 01:39:27.846]  The same size meals, just a little bit less in cost.
[01:39:27.846 --> 01:39:29.186]  No one can match this.
[01:39:29.186 --> 01:39:31.387]  No one can come close to this.
[01:39:31.387 --> 01:39:41.032]  Believe me, I was in talks with three different major food manufacturers that have good names, and they would not go to the level that My Patriot Supply has.
[01:39:41.032 --> 01:39:42.613]  And I'll be honest with you, they're great folks.
[01:39:42.613 --> 01:39:44.294]  I twisted their arm for two years to do this.
[01:39:45.655 --> 01:39:47.476]  So, I drive a hard bargain.
[01:39:47.476 --> 01:39:50.239]  They're great folks, and I'm passing the savings on to you.
[01:39:50.239 --> 01:39:53.362]  They already have some of the best prices out there, the highest quality food.
[01:39:53.362 --> 01:39:56.144]  It's why I chose them.
[01:39:56.144 --> 01:40:00.368]  We can sell 50 different companies' water filters, make more money, dominate the market.
[01:40:00.368 --> 01:40:05.033]  I only sell four different brands because they're the best and they're affordable at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:40:06.738 --> 01:40:13.161]  Well, we have been able to find something like 10 different really good non-GMO, non-hybrid heirloom seed companies.
[01:40:13.161 --> 01:40:17.443]  So we have the InfoWare Seed Center with one of the largest selections, lowest prices out there.
[01:40:17.443 --> 01:40:20.544]  I have to sign contracts not to go any lower.
[01:40:20.544 --> 01:40:21.845]  We are free market all the way.
[01:40:23.855 --> 01:40:25.476]  So, Steve Wetzel joins us.
[01:40:25.476 --> 01:40:28.297]  He is the Chief Financial Officer of MyPatriotSupply.
[01:40:28.297 --> 01:40:36.280]  In just five years, they've grown to dominate the market, be one of the biggest companies out there, because they sell stuff at high quality at low prices.
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:42.002]  And now we have InfoWars Select, powered by MyPatriotSupply, at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:40:42.002 --> 01:40:44.563]  You can call us, ask any questions you've got.
[01:40:46.087 --> 01:40:51.928]  The great part about this is they don't make the food months after or buy some old food and sell it to you months after and make you wait.
[01:40:51.928 --> 01:40:57.690]  They have their own factories, their own facilities in Utah and other states, and they ship it right to you.
[01:40:57.690 --> 01:41:00.150]  We're talking about in a week.
[01:41:00.150 --> 01:41:05.912]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:41:05.912 --> 01:41:11.713]  Two-week supplies, four-week supplies, three-month supplies, six-month supplies, one-year supplies.
[01:41:12.878 --> 01:41:14.961]  Fruit and veggie snack mix.
[01:41:14.961 --> 01:41:16.103]  It's all there.
[01:41:16.103 --> 01:41:22.373]  And, you know, I was talking to Steve, or my crew was, and I said, send over talking points about why you think people should have horrible foods.
[01:41:22.373 --> 01:41:24.537]  And it's exactly what I think.
[01:41:24.537 --> 01:41:25.518]  I personally...
[01:41:26.721 --> 01:41:30.703]  Just use the storable foods after a few years, even though it lasts 10 or more years.
[01:41:30.703 --> 01:41:35.545]  Or I give it to charity and people really like it, because I always have enough for myself, my family, and my neighbors.
[01:41:35.545 --> 01:41:40.527]  So I'm about to make more purchases myself and rotate out the three-year-old food I've got.
[01:41:40.527 --> 01:41:42.148]  I rotate food out every three years.
[01:41:42.148 --> 01:41:44.689]  It's just an insurance policy I can eat.
[01:41:44.689 --> 01:41:45.910]  It's also great when you go camping.
[01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:47.390]  This is the highest quality.
[01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:49.952]  Steve, you've got these points here.
[01:41:49.952 --> 01:41:54.794]  The need for preparedness, the upcoming storm, it's already here, whether it's economic, political, or natural-driven.
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:57.780]  Yes.
[01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:00.422]  Let's go over it all here with what's happening.
[01:42:00.422 --> 01:42:04.203]  Texas wants its gold back, all the things that are happening.
[01:42:04.203 --> 01:42:11.547]  But first off, thank you for giving us such a great offer and partnering with InfoWars to bring folks InfoWars Select.
[01:42:11.547 --> 01:42:16.989]  Am I hyping it that this is the lowest ever that you've gone?
[01:42:16.989 --> 01:42:20.491]  This is, yes, the lowest we've ever gone.
[01:42:20.491 --> 01:42:24.252]  And basically, we really wanted to make a good
[01:42:28.068 --> 01:42:36.473]  Well, they're amazing, and I mean, I was just honest.
[01:42:36.473 --> 01:42:44.538]  I went around because I would like to have four or five sponsors, and you guys just have the best food at the lowest price, so that's why we have one company that's My Patriot Supply.
[01:42:44.538 --> 01:42:48.741]  How do you guys have such quality and still have the lowest prices?
[01:42:48.741 --> 01:42:50.522]  I guess you just have smaller profit margins?
[01:42:51.823 --> 01:42:53.384]  We do.
[01:42:53.384 --> 01:42:57.785]  For us, we actually live, eat, and breathe preparedness.
[01:42:57.785 --> 01:43:08.529]  So really, this is just a bunch of people who are really into preparedness, who are trying to share this preparedness movement with people.
[01:43:08.529 --> 01:43:11.510]  As for our food, it all begins with our ingredients.
[01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:13.611]  We just don't settle for any ingredients.
[01:43:14.526 --> 01:43:17.988]  Uh, we actually go out and we analyze these things.
[01:43:17.988 --> 01:43:22.590]  We truly want to have 25-year shelf life food.
[01:43:22.590 --> 01:43:25.612]  And, you know, some people may cut corners.
[01:43:25.612 --> 01:43:28.193]  You're not going to get that with My Patriot Supply.
[01:43:28.193 --> 01:43:31.835]  We really want this to be available to people when they need it.
[01:43:31.835 --> 01:43:33.356]  When that time strikes,
[01:43:34.266 --> 01:43:38.808]  They need to know that they can rely upon our food and our products.
[01:43:38.808 --> 01:43:45.070]  Well, the packaging alone is the best in the industry, and that's why you've gone from being small in five years to dominating.
[01:43:45.070 --> 01:43:51.152]  Let's go through the quality of the food and what folks will find at InfoWarsSelect.com.
[01:43:51.152 --> 01:43:54.373]  That URL will take you directly to the InfoWars store subpage.
[01:43:54.773 --> 01:43:55.013]  I think so.
[01:44:16.332 --> 01:44:19.454]  I bet you guys are having trouble at your factories keeping supply.
[01:44:19.454 --> 01:44:20.895]  Yeah, it's exploded.
[01:44:20.895 --> 01:44:23.817]  I mean, people can see what we're warning about starting to come true.
[01:44:23.817 --> 01:44:28.799]  I hope people don't need this food, but this is a no-brainer to not be dependent on the system.
[01:44:28.799 --> 01:44:31.961]  People must have storable food.
[01:44:31.961 --> 01:44:34.443]  Well, like I said, it begins with our ingredients.
[01:44:34.443 --> 01:44:37.785]  So one thing for sure, we have no MSG.
[01:44:37.785 --> 01:44:40.727]  We have no autolyzed yeast extract.
[01:44:40.727 --> 01:44:43.068]  We want our food to taste
[01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:46.931]  Just as good in 25 years as it will now.
[01:44:46.931 --> 01:44:51.073]  So we have the best packaging in the industry.
[01:44:51.073 --> 01:44:53.114]  Not all Mylar is created equal.
[01:44:53.114 --> 01:44:59.898]  So we provide a true military-grade barrier against light, oxygen, moisture.
[01:44:59.898 --> 01:45:02.859]  And you can see the totes that this food's packaged in.
[01:45:02.859 --> 01:45:07.782]  It's made to be either stored underneath a bed or stacked in a closet.
[01:45:07.782 --> 01:45:09.703]  You can throw it in the back of your vehicle.
[01:45:10.527 --> 01:45:15.150]  It's made for somebody to carry along with them.
[01:45:15.150 --> 01:45:19.734]  Now, you're saying, you know, why do people need to prepare now?
[01:45:19.734 --> 01:45:24.957]  Well, one of the things I can tell you is I know people are preparing now.
[01:45:24.957 --> 01:45:30.441]  I mean, our food is going out as soon as it is produced on our production line.
[01:45:30.441 --> 01:45:33.584]  Literally, it is going out that fast.
[01:45:33.584 --> 01:45:36.806]  I think the global climate now with
[01:45:37.614 --> 01:45:42.876]  What they're seeing politically, economically, people feel this need to be prepared.
[01:45:42.876 --> 01:45:53.861]  Whether or not they want to call themselves preppers or whether they feel that they're in a preparedness movement, a lot of people are waking up to the fact that something is happening.
[01:45:53.861 --> 01:46:01.084]  And I could just tell you from our sales, we cannot keep enough food stored.
[01:46:01.084 --> 01:46:03.785]  I mean, we're literally producing it and getting it out to people.
[01:46:04.722 --> 01:46:21.108]  And there is so much of an awakening going on right now that other food manufacturers, other people that are in food storage, have contacted MyPatriotSupply to ask if we could help package some of this for them to get it out to the people.
[01:46:21.108 --> 01:46:33.713]  But right now, I assure you, our priority is for your show, Alex, your website, InfoWarsSelect.com, and for our own customers with MyPatriotSupply.com.
[01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:45.547]  Absolutely, and when you back off at this, and look at it from the big picture, there's a lot of aggressive advertising out there, people claiming this, people claiming that, but we've done the deep research on this.
[01:46:45.547 --> 01:46:56.733]  You guys really are the best deal out there, the quickest delivery, manufacturing your own food, keeping with standards, the highest is what I choose for my family, and you're patriots.
[01:46:56.733 --> 01:47:01.116]  You're not fly-by-night groups, you're not Johnny-come-latelys, you're here for the long haul.
[01:47:02.488 --> 01:47:05.870]  I'm not going to bash some of the other groups or some other great groups out there.
[01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:07.931]  There's some other really high quality groups.
[01:47:07.931 --> 01:47:11.793]  They just cost a lot more when you're similar food for a lot less.
[01:47:11.793 --> 01:47:13.394]  So you can get stuff as good out there.
[01:47:13.394 --> 01:47:16.856]  It's just going to cost you twice as much or three times as much.
[01:47:16.856 --> 01:47:20.378]  But I've tested out the stuff you get at the Urban Outfitters.
[01:47:21.078 --> 01:47:22.139]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:47:33.362 --> 01:47:37.645]  I know you don't want to get into your customers, but I happen to know the inside baseball industry wide.
[01:47:37.645 --> 01:47:43.389]  Government, police departments, corporations, rich people are hoarding food now.
[01:47:43.389 --> 01:47:57.399]  I hope we don't go into a major depression, but I think the smartest move people that can afford it is to have a two-year food supply, but if you don't have a three-month food supply for your whole family, folks, I believe you are being recklessly negligent.
[01:47:57.399 --> 01:48:02.123]  It's so affordable at InfoWarsSelect.com and the little bit of profit we make
[01:48:02.783 --> 01:48:04.123]  Helps fund this operation.
[01:48:04.123 --> 01:48:18.606]  We're about to launch the TV network so much more I only have a sponsor on the show every once a month to help promote things We don't have an infomercial format, but this is also a public service announcement If you don't have your preparedness Straight you're crazy.
[01:48:18.606 --> 01:48:32.189]  I mean look at the stock market look at Texas wanting its gold back talk about that Steve Well, this is just an example of how people in general are really not trusting
[01:48:33.211 --> 01:48:35.051]  What's going on with the federal government?
[01:48:35.051 --> 01:48:46.894]  I'm not saying that everybody is bad and everything is wrong, but people are starting to wake up and realize that they have to start taking responsibility for themselves.
[01:48:46.894 --> 01:48:51.535]  So if we look at like a state like Texas, I admire what they're doing.
[01:48:51.535 --> 01:48:58.736]  It's a group of people in that state that are thinking, hey, you know, we need to join together.
[01:48:59.694 --> 01:49:01.555]  And be prepared for what's going on.
[01:49:01.555 --> 01:49:16.963]  They can see what direction the federal government is going, and I think a lot of people would agree that the state elected to have a federal government.
[01:49:16.963 --> 01:49:20.304]  It wasn't the federal government electing to have states.
[01:49:20.304 --> 01:49:24.286]  So, you know, where does all of this lead us?
[01:49:24.286 --> 01:49:25.787]  It leads us to the fact that
[01:49:26.727 --> 01:49:35.472]  The individual person needs to be prepared, needs to take responsibility and take care of him or herself to be empowered.
[01:49:35.472 --> 01:49:40.715]  You know, having this food is just one part of that.
[01:49:40.715 --> 01:49:47.258]  You know, the naysayers will say something like the state of Texas will want to secede from the nation.
[01:49:47.258 --> 01:49:48.079]  It's not about that.
[01:49:48.826 --> 01:49:50.828]  You know, people should be able to understand that.
[01:50:08.223 --> 01:50:10.844]  Steve, I want to start checking in with you once a month.
[01:50:10.844 --> 01:50:12.464]  I also want to get you on the nightly news.

[01:51:03.477 --> 01:51:06.560]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.

[01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:46.541]  Most 30-day kits don't have enough calories to sustain you for more than a week.
[01:53:46.541 --> 01:53:49.202]  They just don't have enough nutrition to do the job.

[01:54:15.738 --> 01:54:25.485]  We are back broadcasting worldwide live from the Infowars.com news centers in Austin, Texas, where we're trying to break through people's trance through their brainwashing.
[01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:34.103]  And if people don't get prepared mentally, physically, economically, it's just crazy.
[01:54:34.103 --> 01:54:41.348]  And it doesn't mean having storable foods or a garden is going to save the world, but that attitude is.
[01:54:41.348 --> 01:54:44.550]  Now, I want to open the phones up in the next hour and cover a ton of news.
[01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:48.493]  The toll-free number to join us on any of the issues, any of the items I've raised.
[01:54:49.343 --> 01:54:50.424]  You're welcome to call in.
[01:54:50.424 --> 01:54:52.085]  I'd love to hear from you.
[01:54:52.085 --> 01:54:54.687]  Agree, disagree, whatever the case may be.
[01:54:54.687 --> 01:54:54.747]  800-259-9231.
[01:54:54.747 --> 01:54:55.968]  800-259-9231.
[01:54:55.968 --> 01:55:14.703]  How arrogant is it, though, of political correctness, and how buffaloed is the West, to say you're going to accept millions of people into your country and you've got to pay for them, but Saudi Arabia
[01:55:16.206 --> 01:55:20.707]  Won't take one refugee and neither will any of the other Arab states.
[01:55:20.707 --> 01:55:24.809]  It's just a joke!
[01:55:24.809 --> 01:55:33.731]  I'm going to break that down at the start of the next hour because it's so important on the 15th anniversary of 9-11.
[01:55:33.731 --> 01:55:36.772]  Can you believe it's been that long?
[01:55:36.772 --> 01:55:38.173]  It's the 14th or the 15th.
[01:55:38.173 --> 01:55:41.254]  I'm having one of those mental snafus.
[01:55:41.254 --> 01:55:42.294]  It's the 15th anniversary.
[01:55:44.665 --> 01:55:47.766]  Of that attack, are we safer now than we were then?
[01:55:47.766 --> 01:55:53.629]  No, our government is running ISIS and Al-Qaeda and protecting them and that's in the news.
[01:55:53.629 --> 01:56:07.074]  And the former head of Defense Intelligence, cue that back up for next hour, went public and then another top general went public and said we are protecting them, we helped fund them and I followed orders.
[01:56:07.074 --> 01:56:09.235]  And the intelligence is being covered up.
[01:56:09.235 --> 01:56:09.575]  Well now
[01:56:12.745 --> 01:56:39.558]  Fifty spies have gone public and blown the whistle on the eve of 9-11, on the anniversary, and said that they put out the proper intelligence of what ISIS was doing from the beginning, and that it's covered up, and that fake intelligence is created above them, which is a fraud, which is a criminal act in every sense of the meaning.
[01:56:41.112 --> 01:56:51.980]  And then, we have a lot of these refugees that are criminals, that are military age men, that turn out to be ISIS, coming into the West, and the answer is, in Germany, don't wear short skirts.
[01:56:51.980 --> 01:56:58.405]  You've got to comply with the visitors, with the precious migrants, that show up and say, give us everything free.
[01:56:58.405 --> 01:57:08.052]  And then Donald Trump, who'd come out, we're going to play this clip, and said, a few days ago, hey, we've got to take them, Merkel's doing a great job, we've got to bring these people into America, nobody else will.
[01:57:09.175 --> 01:57:10.977]  Probably politically correct.
[01:57:10.977 --> 01:57:12.439]  He's now backpedaled.
[01:57:12.439 --> 01:57:13.380]  Let's play this clip.
[01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:14.361]  Here he is with Sean Hannity.
[01:57:16.371 --> 01:57:18.372]  Well, it's a serious problem.
[01:57:18.372 --> 01:57:23.114]  We haven't seen anything like it since the Second World War, and it's getting worse and worse.
[01:57:23.114 --> 01:57:31.177]  And I was actually impressed in one way, but surprised that Merkel in Germany allowed this to happen, because they're really flowing through all over Europe.
[01:57:31.177 --> 01:57:41.622]  And if you notice, Russia's not taking, and China's not taking, and the Gulf states, whether you look at Saudi Arabia or Qatar or any of them, they're taking none.
[01:57:42.382 --> 01:57:47.103]  But some of them are, and some of them are actually being very generous.
[01:57:47.103 --> 01:57:53.145]  It's just really, I wonder, you know, where all these people are coming from exactly, and what are they representing?
[01:57:53.145 --> 01:57:55.766]  Because do you have people from ISIS in that group?
[01:57:55.766 --> 01:57:59.987]  You know, there's a lot of security risk with it, but something has to be done.
[01:57:59.987 --> 01:58:03.288]  It's an unbelievable humanitarian problem.
[01:58:03.288 --> 01:58:08.110]  Okay, Israel's not taking any... Something must be done.
[01:58:08.110 --> 01:58:09.410]  Something must be done.
[01:58:11.738 --> 01:58:18.082]  Now when we come back, we're going to launch the phone system, and we're going to start taking your phone calls at 800-259-9231.
[01:58:18.082 --> 01:58:36.694]  And I'm going to get into all the economic news, all the Hillary news, her fall is becoming more assured by the moment, John Boehner meeting secretly with the Communist leader of the world, the Pope, and more.
[01:58:36.694 --> 01:58:37.435]  That's all in the third hour.

[02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:12.440]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:17.283]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.283 --> 02:00:21.325]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:39.728]  All right, we played the original clip earlier, if you just joined us, of Trump saying we got to bring the illegals in, because it's our job to pay for everybody.
[02:00:39.728 --> 02:00:43.292]  Here's the new clip with Hannity, with him backing off.
[02:00:44.732 --> 02:01:01.885]  I mean the big problem is how do you flip-flop from we can't take all these people, there's a lot of criminals from around the world trying to get here, which is true, to now we got to take all these people when really it's the jails and the criminals and the welfare heads that the Middle East is dumping out and won't take any of them back in.
[02:01:01.885 --> 02:01:04.507]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip of Trump backpedaling.
[02:01:04.864 --> 02:01:09.707]  Look, from a humanitarian standpoint, I'd love to help, but we have our own problems.
[02:01:09.707 --> 02:01:12.189]  We have so many problems that we have to solve.
[02:01:12.189 --> 02:01:15.351]  You have over there the Gulf States, tremendously wealthy.
[02:01:15.351 --> 02:01:18.433]  You have five groups of people, six groups.
[02:01:18.433 --> 02:01:19.954]  They're not taking anybody.
[02:01:19.954 --> 02:01:22.476]  Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain.
[02:01:22.476 --> 02:01:25.878]  These are tremendously wealthy and powerful from the standpoint of
[02:01:26.638 --> 02:01:27.799]  So, there you go.
[02:01:48.029 --> 02:01:53.654]  There you go, that is him now starting to basically backtrack.
[02:01:53.654 --> 02:01:59.659]  Obama said the line was chemical weapons that ISIS-slash-Al Qaeda used.
[02:01:59.659 --> 02:02:10.868]  The line was our government and the neocons and John McCain, the Republican leadership that you love so much, Donald Trump.
[02:02:10.868 --> 02:02:11.469]  The line
[02:02:13.154 --> 02:02:14.815]  Yeah, uh, good afternoon Alex.
[02:02:14.815 --> 02:02:17.876]  Yeah, uh, I just wanted to say as far as, uh, my mind just blanked out.
[02:02:17.876 --> 02:02:19.756]  No, that happens to me sometimes too.
[02:02:38.142 --> 02:02:44.506]  Okay, here's the thing with everything that's going on that you cover so, you know, accurately.
[02:02:44.506 --> 02:02:48.348]  I am really frustrated as a Christian.
[02:02:48.348 --> 02:02:49.909]  I'm a believer in Jesus Christ.
[02:02:49.909 --> 02:02:59.055]  I've been saved for over 36 years, and I am so frustrated because the people that should be the most awake and the most aware, and I have to say this,
[02:02:59.662 --> 02:03:03.383]  They seem to be the most brainwashed and zombified, and that's the Christians of America.
[02:03:03.383 --> 02:03:17.345]  Well, that's because the World Council of Churches and National Council of Churches and 501c3 turned them into government organs where government think tanks and private groups think tanks write the theology for all the major denominations.
[02:03:17.345 --> 02:03:21.766]  The Pope, basically, is like the world communist leader now.
[02:03:21.766 --> 02:03:24.347]  And I heard Christians calling in to a local talk show yesterday.
[02:03:24.347 --> 02:03:25.367]  I was listening to the news.
[02:03:25.987 --> 02:03:28.129]  And they were like, follow Romans 13.
[02:03:28.129 --> 02:03:29.770]  Do what they say.
[02:03:29.770 --> 02:03:31.952]  Preachers should marry gay people.
[02:03:31.952 --> 02:03:33.713]  The Bible doesn't say anything against it.
[02:03:33.713 --> 02:03:34.373]  Blah, blah, blah.
[02:03:34.373 --> 02:03:35.855]  Well, it does.
[02:03:35.855 --> 02:03:39.137]  But regardless, they were saying that woman should be in jail.
[02:03:39.137 --> 02:03:39.738]  Doesn't matter.
[02:03:39.738 --> 02:03:42.199]  Christians do what they're told.
[02:03:42.199 --> 02:03:44.942]  That's a giant Romans 13 pacifier.
[02:03:47.202 --> 02:03:53.367]  When all Paul did was say no to the government, ended up being killed for it with the rest of the disciples.
[02:03:53.367 --> 02:03:57.971]  I mean, was there any disciple that didn't get killed for not following the state's orders?
[02:03:57.971 --> 02:04:04.016]  This is inverted reality with stupid, fake Christians sitting in there
[02:04:05.356 --> 02:04:07.738]  Loving all of this, okay?
[02:04:07.738 --> 02:04:17.823]  So you can tell the average Methodist, or even the average Baptist now, to come to Sunday school, the government legalized roasting aborted fetuses, and they would eat barbecue baby.
[02:04:17.823 --> 02:04:19.244]  And I'm not joking.
[02:04:19.244 --> 02:04:22.665]  They'd say, the state ordered me to eat barbecue baby, I'm gonna do it.
[02:04:22.665 --> 02:04:25.607]  There's nothing they won't do.
[02:04:25.607 --> 02:04:27.048]  So you made a great point.
[02:04:27.048 --> 02:04:29.149]  That's because these aren't churches.
[02:04:29.149 --> 02:04:32.610]  These are 501c3 government whorehouses.
[02:04:32.610 --> 02:04:33.511]  Anything else, Stephen?
[02:04:34.696 --> 02:04:44.446]  Yeah, I just wanted to say, I think the major factor in why so many Christians are so out of it and don't want to believe what's going on, because they believe in this fake pre-trib rapture theory as I call it.
[02:04:44.446 --> 02:04:46.888]  Stay there, I'm gonna come back to you, absolutely.
[02:04:46.888 --> 02:04:49.811]  Yeah, a total cop-out, a reset button.
[02:04:49.811 --> 02:04:51.653]  Like it's the edge of tomorrow.
[02:04:51.653 --> 02:04:53.255]  There is no reset.
[02:04:53.255 --> 02:04:55.537]  I've read the Bible, a five-year-old can understand it.
[02:04:55.537 --> 02:04:57.199]  You go through the tribulation, cowards.
[02:04:59.226 --> 02:05:03.287]  We're being told that Snowden's window for a plea bargain deal is closing.
[02:05:03.287 --> 02:05:14.931]  Bloomberg reports a national security specialist saying, Many people in government believe the journalists who receive Snowden's material are not capable of protecting it from a competent and committed state-level adversary.
[02:05:14.931 --> 02:05:19.393]  Even if Snowden did not give the material to others, they argue it would have been ripe for the picking.
[02:05:19.813 --> 02:05:22.356]  Well, isn't that true of Hillary's handling of emails?
[02:05:22.356 --> 02:05:28.341]  Didn't her violation of protocol expose above-top secret data to state-level adversaries?
[02:05:28.341 --> 02:05:34.107]  Snowden exposed criminal actions of our government done in the name of national security.
[02:05:34.107 --> 02:05:39.632]  Hillary compromised national security for her own convenience or to cover up her misdeeds.
[02:05:40.593 --> 02:05:50.384]  If national security is more important than the Constitution, if national security is more important than our rights, why isn't Hillary being prosecuted?
[02:05:50.384 --> 02:05:56.390]  Why is Snowden called a traitor and Hillary Clinton is called presidential material?
[02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:57.632]  For InfoWars, I'm David Knight.

[02:08:02.145 --> 02:08:03.566]  I'll show you politics in America.
[02:08:03.566 --> 02:08:06.047]  Here it is, right here.
[02:08:06.047 --> 02:08:08.728]  I think the puppet on the right shares my beliefs.
[02:08:08.728 --> 02:08:13.350]  I think the puppet on the left is more to my liking.
[02:08:13.350 --> 02:08:14.050]  Hey, wait a minute.
[02:08:14.050 --> 02:08:15.911]  There's one guy holding up both puppets.
[02:08:15.911 --> 02:08:17.172]  Shut up!
[02:08:17.172 --> 02:08:18.572]  Go back to bed, America.
[02:08:18.572 --> 02:08:22.134]  Your government is in control.
[02:08:22.134 --> 02:08:27.016]  Defending the republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:08:27.016 --> 02:08:28.457]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:39.827 --> 02:08:44.771]  Coming up in the next segment after I start going to your calls, and I'll go back to calls.
[02:08:44.771 --> 02:08:48.974]  Hungry to declare state of emergency over immigration crisis.
[02:08:48.974 --> 02:08:52.097]  You mean the invasion or the migration?
[02:08:52.097 --> 02:08:53.758]  Hi neighbor, I'm moving into your house.
[02:08:53.758 --> 02:08:55.719]  I'm migrating into your home.
[02:08:55.719 --> 02:08:56.940]  Hey, your wife's pretty good-looking.
[02:08:56.940 --> 02:08:58.241]  I'm gonna migrate into your bed.
[02:08:58.241 --> 02:09:00.143]  I like your bank account.
[02:09:00.143 --> 02:09:01.404]  Can I migrate into it?
[02:09:02.892 --> 02:09:10.035]  Because Europe says you're going to house the illegals, you're going to pay for it, but no precious Arab state will take it.
[02:09:10.035 --> 02:09:15.697]  And then we have the precious little migrants with a liberal trendy.
[02:09:15.697 --> 02:09:21.819]  They're giving them donations of food and money from an aid group and they just steal the entire bag.
[02:09:21.819 --> 02:09:24.080]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:27.802]  Wait till you get mugged by your precious gods.
[02:09:29.306 --> 02:09:30.527]  So that's all coming up.
[02:09:30.527 --> 02:09:35.373]  French security detects ISIS terrorist in refugee camp.
[02:09:35.373 --> 02:09:36.354]  That's all coming up.
[02:09:36.354 --> 02:09:38.936]  I want to look at the imminent fall of Hillary.
[02:09:38.936 --> 02:09:42.280]  It's certainly ripe for it.
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:45.644]  Just three, four weeks ago we weren't sure, but it appeared possible.
[02:09:46.957 --> 02:09:52.039]  But Steve, and then we'll go to Jared, Kevin, Roger, Alan, and others.
[02:09:52.039 --> 02:09:55.321]  Steve, if you just joined us, got cut off by the break and he brought up a really good point.
[02:09:55.321 --> 02:10:06.326]  He believes it's the post-tribulation or pre-tribulation rapture, pre-tribulation rapture, that's before Christ comes back, that is the ultimate reason Christians
[02:10:07.870 --> 02:10:10.091]  Aren't politically involved anymore.
[02:10:10.091 --> 02:10:24.600]  And in 1776, the war against the corrupt British crown, an empire never defeated by Spain or France or anybody else, not Russia, not the Dutch, no one.
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:28.002]  England won wars, you know, two to one.
[02:10:28.002 --> 02:10:29.123]  Well, they were outnumbered two to one.
[02:10:30.942 --> 02:10:36.504]  Never defeated, but defeated by a very small force led by the Black Brigades.
[02:10:36.504 --> 02:10:45.088]  Because in those days, all the priests, whether they be Presbyterian or Methodist or Baptist or Catholic, wore black.
[02:10:45.088 --> 02:10:46.429]  Many of them wore white collars.
[02:10:46.429 --> 02:10:47.549]  That was the uniform.
[02:10:47.549 --> 02:10:51.891]  And it was the Black Brigade that really was the heart.
[02:10:51.891 --> 02:10:56.953]  And so around that time, you can go back to after the war, the British and others began to fund a movement
[02:10:58.769 --> 02:11:16.420]  To put out the idea through different Masonic channels, and I'm not bashing Masons, but that's the channels they use, you can look this up, through really Baptist groups, to promote a pre-tribulation rapture.
[02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:24.586]  Now, Ishak and all the rest of those folks, and the Lion's Den, and the Fiery Furnace, and Jesus Christ, and
[02:11:26.428 --> 02:11:54.674]  The prophet that said he was coming, John the Baptist, and almost every other prophet or disciple were boiled in oil, crucified upside down, heads chopped off, tortured to death, stoned to death, flayed to death, beaten to death, burned to death, but we're told that that's not the case now.
[02:11:56.744 --> 02:12:14.382]  We're told now that there is a transponder teleporter up on a giant Enterprise spaceship with Scotty and with Captain Kirk and Spock is there and they sit there and teleport people up
[02:12:17.850 --> 02:12:20.672]  So they won't have to face any evil.
[02:12:20.672 --> 02:12:42.223]  And so, and I don't care what church you go to, the big mainline ones could be Catholic, whatever, could be Protestant, it's, and we're all going to be teleported out of here before anything happens, and airplanes are all going to crash, and all this stuff's going to happen, and I'm not attacking people that push that today, they're well-meaning, but it comes out of the doctrine, just like Romans 13 out of context, to say submit to what the government does.
[02:12:42.223 --> 02:12:44.264]  No, Christ was smart when they wanted to stone him,
[02:12:45.438 --> 02:12:48.959]  He said, render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's.
[02:12:48.959 --> 02:12:50.500]  Who is it on that coin?
[02:12:50.500 --> 02:12:54.421]  The Pharisees say it's Caesar.
[02:12:54.421 --> 02:12:56.222]  It's his system.
[02:12:56.222 --> 02:12:58.983]  You got an American Express card, you're under American Express's rules.
[02:12:58.983 --> 02:13:01.124]  You got a Visa card, you're under their rules.
[02:13:01.124 --> 02:13:04.665]  You're in my house, you're under my rules.
[02:13:04.665 --> 02:13:07.406]  So, render the things to Caesar that are Caesar's.
[02:13:07.406 --> 02:13:08.807]  To God, give what's God's.
[02:13:12.009 --> 02:13:16.072]  And they put it, Bible getaway above it, submission to governing authorities.
[02:13:16.072 --> 02:13:19.314]  That's not in the Bible, those terms.
[02:13:19.314 --> 02:13:21.576]  It is out of context.
[02:13:21.576 --> 02:13:22.596]  It is a total fraud.
[02:13:22.596 --> 02:13:30.782]  Well, then why did the early Christians not do what Nero said and worship Baphomet?
[02:13:30.782 --> 02:13:34.765]  Worship Saturn or Zeus or Bacchus or Janus?
[02:13:39.192 --> 02:13:43.716]  I mean, any idiot knows that Romans 13 is out of context and a complete fraud.
[02:13:43.716 --> 02:13:50.303]  Or Christ broke the rules when he didn't submit to the Roman and Jewish authorities.
[02:13:50.303 --> 02:13:55.228]  And so did Paul.
[02:13:55.228 --> 02:13:59.672]  I mean, it's just on its face ridiculous.
[02:13:59.672 --> 02:14:01.394]  But people are taught 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[02:14:03.444 --> 02:14:05.632]  And that raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit.
[02:14:05.632 --> 02:14:06.816]  And that you didn't build your business.
[02:14:06.816 --> 02:14:07.940]  And that Obamacare is free.
[02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:09.064]  I mean, it's all lies!
[02:14:10.916 --> 02:14:18.697]  And I hear these fake Christians calling these radio shows, you feel real satisfied repeating a talking point about just do what you're told, marry the gay person.
[02:14:18.697 --> 02:14:20.958]  Well, why don't you use the word homosexual?
[02:14:20.958 --> 02:14:24.918]  Again, I don't have anything against quote gay people to use that term.
[02:14:24.918 --> 02:14:29.599]  I have a problem that they first say, use the term gay, be nice to me.
[02:14:29.599 --> 02:14:33.080]  Well, why do you get the word happy, beautiful, green day?
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:36.120]  Happy, beautiful, sunny, it was a gay day.
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:39.041]  He was a gay lad, which means happy, joyful.
[02:14:41.374 --> 02:14:42.775]  People are like, come on, be nice.
[02:14:42.775 --> 02:14:43.856]  Call them what they want to be called.
[02:14:43.856 --> 02:14:47.998]  Okay, well, you know, I want to be called, uh, you know, Rumpelstiltskin.
[02:14:47.998 --> 02:14:50.740]  Okay, we don't want to hurt your feelings, you're Rumpelstiltskin.
[02:14:50.740 --> 02:14:53.202]  Or I want to be called a toaster.
[02:14:53.202 --> 02:14:55.984]  Now in England, they arrest you if you use the word homosexual.
[02:14:55.984 --> 02:14:57.405]  I mean, I'm not joking.
[02:14:57.405 --> 02:14:58.946]  Because groups say it's hateful.
[02:14:58.946 --> 02:15:03.129]  Well, now the word boy and girl is hateful.
[02:15:03.129 --> 02:15:04.129]  Or man or woman.
[02:15:04.129 --> 02:15:04.910]  Or husband or wife.
[02:15:07.406 --> 02:15:13.329]  And so it's the same thing where language is now being dictated to us and being controlled.
[02:15:13.329 --> 02:15:23.934]  And if you'll follow the edict of using the words someone else says, like, there's a politically correct movement of ignorance where they say don't use the word negro.
[02:15:23.934 --> 02:15:28.316]  And I've heard the stories of people when they order at the bar, I want a negro modelo.
[02:15:28.316 --> 02:15:30.096]  That just means black in Spanish.
[02:15:30.096 --> 02:15:32.137]  People get mad.
[02:15:32.137 --> 02:15:33.158]  What's that, the n-word?
[02:15:34.901 --> 02:15:43.525]  And this is people looking for the racism everywhere, but right above them is the big Planned Parenthood mothership, sworn to kill every black person they can get their hands on.
[02:15:43.525 --> 02:15:48.328]  Oh, that's okay, because they're in the black community and they care about us.
[02:15:48.328 --> 02:15:53.310]  Jesse Jackson said so.
[02:15:53.310 --> 02:15:55.111]  So I will use the word Caucasian.
[02:15:55.111 --> 02:15:56.932]  I will use the word Negro.
[02:15:56.932 --> 02:16:01.975]  I will use the word homosexual or heterosexual.
[02:16:01.975 --> 02:16:04.316]  Caucasian just means Caucus Mountains.
[02:16:10.424 --> 02:16:11.544]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:16:11.544 --> 02:16:14.686]  It has nothing to do with anything.
[02:16:14.686 --> 02:16:19.648]  It's total mindlessness.
[02:16:19.648 --> 02:16:27.351]  It's like if I call white people white and black people black, it has nothing to do with anything.
[02:16:27.351 --> 02:16:28.791]  Buckley had a really funny image.
[02:16:28.791 --> 02:16:29.552]  I told him to give it to me.
[02:16:29.552 --> 02:16:31.452]  I forgot to get it and tweet it out.
[02:16:31.452 --> 02:16:33.113]  Buckley, he'll give that to the guys and tweet it out.
[02:16:36.462 --> 02:16:46.387]  Maybe we should tweet the idea that all non-black labs be banned, because they're obviously racist, because they're golden, or they're white, or they're chocolate.
[02:16:46.387 --> 02:16:51.230]  But it says, black labs matter, and next to it, all labs matter.
[02:16:51.230 --> 02:16:52.450]  There it is.
[02:16:52.450 --> 02:16:54.171]  I mean, it's the exact same dog.
[02:16:54.171 --> 02:16:56.892]  They just got different hair, man.
[02:16:56.892 --> 02:17:00.274]  And it's the same idiocy.
[02:17:00.274 --> 02:17:03.796]  It is the same absolute mindless moron behavior.
[02:17:06.015 --> 02:17:15.060]  That the Democratic Party won't even say that all lives matter and has apologized twice for different Democrats saying, no, all lives matter.
[02:17:15.060 --> 02:17:17.461]  No, all lives do matter.
[02:17:17.461 --> 02:17:21.183]  And if we don't think all lives matter, then none of our lives matter.
[02:17:21.183 --> 02:17:25.725]  But the rapture is a fraud.
[02:17:25.725 --> 02:17:28.306]  There's the Battle of Armageddon.
[02:17:28.306 --> 02:17:29.327]  Christ comes back.
[02:17:29.327 --> 02:17:30.948]  The dead in Christ are raised.
[02:17:33.666 --> 02:17:37.370]  And then those living spend a thousand years with Christ here on Earth.
[02:17:37.370 --> 02:17:39.332]  That's what the Bible says.
[02:17:39.332 --> 02:17:43.656]  And they've got it that there's a teleporter machine.
[02:17:43.656 --> 02:17:44.737]  Whatever!
[02:17:44.737 --> 02:17:47.860]  Let's just say God the Devil isn't real for the sake of argument.
[02:17:47.860 --> 02:17:50.563]  I'm going to fight putting fluoride in the water.
[02:17:50.563 --> 02:17:53.526]  I'm going to fight aborting babies and selling their body parts.
[02:17:53.526 --> 02:17:56.850]  And I don't care if twiddly-D and twiddly-dumb preachers
[02:17:58.308 --> 02:18:06.132]  Get up there on television in front of their crowds and follow their 501c3 and give their government script.
[02:18:06.132 --> 02:18:08.133]  Steven, finish up your points, brother.
[02:18:08.133 --> 02:18:10.034]  Thanks for holding.
[02:18:10.034 --> 02:18:10.935]  Yeah, thank you, Alex.
[02:18:10.935 --> 02:18:12.936]  Yeah, I just want to say this, okay?
[02:18:12.936 --> 02:18:22.261]  I bring up different points to Christian about what a Planned Parenthood has been doing and how you've shown that they're putting DNA and baby parts in the vaccine.
[02:18:23.010 --> 02:18:35.981]  Uh, you know, what's happening with Christian business owners around the country, like Aaron and Melissa Klein up there in Portland, Oregon, or Baron L. Stutzman in Washington, that the Sodomite community is going after and using the government to do it.
[02:18:35.981 --> 02:18:39.984]  And now this woman, Kim Davis, in Kentucky, this county clerk.
[02:18:39.984 --> 02:18:44.928]  The point I make is that when I bring these things up, the automatic response, and it's like Pamplovian.
[02:18:45.812 --> 02:18:52.137]  Oh, it's just another sign that the Lord's return is imminent and he's going to split that eastern sky and we're all going to be out of here.
[02:18:52.137 --> 02:19:01.805]  And I'm trying to tell them that the exact mentality of Christians in America today is where the church was at in 1920s Germany prior to Hitler taking over.
[02:19:02.205 --> 02:19:03.506]  And they got wiped out.
[02:19:03.506 --> 02:19:06.247]  The same thing happened in Korea and Vietnam.
[02:19:06.247 --> 02:19:13.692]  The church got wiped out there when the communists came in because they were not doing what the apostles admonished the church in the first century.
[02:19:13.692 --> 02:19:17.274]  And that was, if you're going to follow Jesus Christ, you will be persecuted.
[02:19:17.754 --> 02:19:25.279]  And you're not going to escape what's coming, so you might as well just reckon with it and stand for what's true and preach the gospel, come what may.
[02:19:25.279 --> 02:19:28.761]  You may be fed to the lions in the Coliseum, but you have eternal life.
[02:19:28.761 --> 02:19:32.484]  But these people in America today, out to the most part, they're scared to death.
[02:19:32.484 --> 02:19:34.045]  They don't want to suffer.
[02:19:34.045 --> 02:19:36.867]  They don't want to lay their lives down like they say they do.
[02:19:36.867 --> 02:19:38.528]  And I've been telling everybody this.
[02:19:38.528 --> 02:19:44.312]  Go to Chuck Baldwin's site and read these articles he's written, like what a waste.
[02:19:44.312 --> 02:19:47.474]  And the collapse of Christianity in America.
[02:19:47.594 --> 02:19:49.276]  I want to get him on about those articles.
[02:19:49.276 --> 02:19:49.917]  You're absolutely right.
[02:19:49.917 --> 02:19:52.320]  Let's get him on tomorrow, in fact, if we can.
[02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:53.301]  More calls coming up.
[02:19:53.301 --> 02:19:53.702]  Stay with us.

[02:20:58.852 --> 02:21:03.274]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[02:21:03.274 --> 02:21:07.316]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[02:21:07.316 --> 02:21:11.698]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[02:21:14.679 --> 02:21:19.922]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?

[02:21:58.502 --> 02:22:07.807]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:22:07.807 --> 02:22:08.607]  This capitalism?
[02:22:08.607 --> 02:22:14.770]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:22:14.770 --> 02:22:18.472]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[02:23:57.019 --> 02:24:09.806]  Alright, I'm gonna try to go quickly now to your calls.
[02:24:09.806 --> 02:24:11.267]  I had one caller on for like 20 minutes.
[02:24:11.267 --> 02:24:11.847]  I apologize.
[02:24:11.847 --> 02:24:15.729]  But it was a really important subject and I'm gonna get Chuck Baldwin back on because
[02:24:17.469 --> 02:24:21.312]  Any group can turn into bullies and thugs and a cult.
[02:24:21.312 --> 02:24:22.433]  On the left is a cult.
[02:24:22.433 --> 02:24:25.816]  They want to force our kids to live the way they want them to live.
[02:24:25.816 --> 02:24:28.138]  They want to take over our society.
[02:24:28.138 --> 02:24:29.439]  And it's not about equality.
[02:24:29.439 --> 02:24:31.821]  It's not about tolerance.
[02:24:31.821 --> 02:24:33.722]  It's about being dominated.
[02:24:33.722 --> 02:24:35.604]  It's about power.
[02:24:35.604 --> 02:24:38.907]  I always hear these psychologists and people like Gore Vidal.
[02:24:38.907 --> 02:24:39.727]  I read some of his books.
[02:24:39.727 --> 02:24:40.428]  Pretty smart guy.
[02:24:40.428 --> 02:24:42.429]  I agree with him on a lot of historical perspectives.
[02:24:42.429 --> 02:24:44.151]  Saying sex is about power.
[02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:51.242]  Well, maybe in his weird, homoerotic world it was about power.
[02:24:51.242 --> 02:25:07.132]  In my world, it's about love, it's about pleasure, it's about trust, it's about intimacy, it's about enjoyment, it's about stress relief, it's about, most importantly, procreation.
[02:25:07.132 --> 02:25:10.053]  And let's not forget why it's the main drive.
[02:25:10.053 --> 02:25:15.396]  Beyond food and water, folks, it's sex.
[02:25:15.396 --> 02:25:16.017]  And it's because
[02:25:17.620 --> 02:25:20.361]  It's why we exist.
[02:25:20.361 --> 02:25:25.484]  It's the driving force of procreation, of reproduction.
[02:25:25.484 --> 02:25:27.885]  And when you target that, you target the species.
[02:25:27.885 --> 02:25:34.229]  And I look at the entire attack system, the entire attack checklist of what we're under, and it is
[02:25:35.441 --> 02:25:39.682]  What I would do, I was space aliens here, masquerading as humans, if I wanted to kill humanity.
[02:25:39.682 --> 02:25:41.283]  I mean, that's it.
[02:25:41.283 --> 02:25:43.063]  I'm not saying it's space aliens, you know that.
[02:25:43.063 --> 02:26:01.728]  I'm just saying, if I was a robot computer analyzing this, I would say, alien intelligence, you know, crime analysis, masquerading as humans on the surface of Earth, overthrow of civilization, cutting off energy supplies, stifling development, enslaving public, dumbing down population, attacking fertility rates,
[02:26:02.208 --> 02:26:07.570]  Stifling space exploration for operation termination of population.
[02:26:07.570 --> 02:26:20.494]  Prime projection bio-weapons developed by alien species after weakening a population will cause mass collapse and eradication of Homo sapiens sapien on planet Terra.
[02:26:20.494 --> 02:26:21.094]  That's basically it.
[02:26:22.756 --> 02:26:29.342]  Look at a science fiction movie, like The Thing, where it says, you know, how many hours till total world population infected?
[02:26:29.342 --> 02:26:31.524]  3,785 hours.
[02:26:31.524 --> 02:26:32.705]  Prime projection, 98%.
[02:26:32.705 --> 02:26:36.208]  I mean, it's like that.
[02:26:36.208 --> 02:26:48.240]  And I'm just sitting here watching the robots go online, reading the elite's books, how they're gonna kill everybody, and I'm just like, oh, and now they're gonna shut the roads down and put taxes by the mile, and now they're gonna... And I'm just sitting here watching it.
[02:26:48.936 --> 02:26:50.056]  We are your friends.
[02:26:50.056 --> 02:26:51.357]  God bless you sir and thank you very much.
[02:26:51.357 --> 02:26:52.177]  How are you today?
[02:26:52.177 --> 02:26:53.297]  Well, talking about being fired up.
[02:27:19.230 --> 02:27:30.339]  One of the 45, 50 million strong in the United States, depending on which statistic that you look at, of the disabled community.
[02:27:30.339 --> 02:27:36.784]  I happen to be in the blind demographic.
[02:27:36.784 --> 02:27:42.488]  Or, if you want to be politically correct, visually impaired, which I challenged.
[02:27:47.584 --> 02:28:03.702]  You know, you talk a lot, since I've found you anyway over the past three weeks or a month, about the domination that we're under by our federal government.
[02:28:03.702 --> 02:28:08.047]  My question deals with the Declaration of Independence.
[02:28:11.694 --> 02:28:13.014]  The question kind of goes like this.
[02:28:13.014 --> 02:28:22.398]  Do you agree that the Declaration of Independence is the foundational document upon which the Constitution rests?
[02:28:22.398 --> 02:28:28.841]  Yes, it is the kickoff of the whole shebang, more important than the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[02:28:28.841 --> 02:28:30.242]  It states it's our right as
[02:28:31.084 --> 02:28:32.725]  I would stand in agreement with you on that, sir.
[02:29:01.161 --> 02:29:14.148]  In the first couple of sentences of the Declaration of Independence, I believe you were alluding to this a second ago, it's our right.
[02:29:14.148 --> 02:29:15.769]  Our duty.
[02:29:15.769 --> 02:29:19.470]  Our duty, our responsibility.
[02:29:19.470 --> 02:29:20.231]  To throw off.
[02:29:21.175 --> 02:29:22.716]  To throw off a tyrannical government.
[02:29:22.716 --> 02:29:31.320]  In fact, you know, people shouldn't dissolve governments lightly or for transient means, but when in the course of human events it becomes time to admit you're under a tyranny, it's got to be done.
[02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:32.720]  To paraphrase, stay there.
[02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:34.301]  I'm going to come back, Al, and finish up with you.
[02:29:34.301 --> 02:29:42.945]  I'm going to hurry to Kevin, and then to Jared, and then to Gerald, Brian, and others.
[02:29:42.945 --> 02:29:43.345]  800-259-9231.
[02:29:43.345 --> 02:29:48.888]  And Anthony Guciardi is going to pop in briefly with some news as well.
[02:29:49.809 --> 02:29:51.434]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.434 --> 02:29:55.046]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.349 --> 02:30:08.795]  Schools in Germany are ordering teenage girls not to wear miniskirts or shorts as to avoid offending Muslim immigrants.
[02:30:08.795 --> 02:30:19.501]  Parents were warned that their children should not wear revealing clothes for fear of misunderstandings that could lead to attacks by the migrants.
[02:30:19.501 --> 02:30:25.105]  Children were also told that derogatory or racial remarks will not be tolerated.
[02:30:25.925 --> 02:30:42.728]  The letter was actually sent out at the end of June, but it is drawing fresh attention in the light of Germany's plan to accept 800,000 new migrants before the end of the year, and 500,000 a year for the foreseeable future.
[02:30:42.728 --> 02:30:53.770]  InfoWars has been contacted by families in Germany who say that their schools are telling girls not to wear shorts, even in hot weather, to prevent sexual assaults by immigrants.
[02:30:54.210 --> 02:30:59.051]  Need to learn more about this story right now at InfoWars.com.

[02:31:15.095 --> 02:31:18.676]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[02:31:33.299 --> 02:31:37.459]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[02:33:15.652 --> 02:33:24.619]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:24.619 --> 02:33:29.383]  That's right, a frontal assault because the people aren't aware of the enemy.
[02:33:29.383 --> 02:33:40.431]  It's our job to do as much damage as we can by absolutely just frying the enemy's operations by throwing it right in their face what scum they are.
[02:33:41.412 --> 02:33:43.373]  And it's effective and it's happening.
[02:33:43.373 --> 02:33:44.714]  Huge news blitz coming up.
[02:33:44.714 --> 02:33:52.820]  Anthony Gucciardi's here with amazing news on Alzheimer's, anti-psychotic and psychotropic drugs, and more.
[02:33:52.820 --> 02:33:57.262]  We'll be talking to him here in just a few minutes, but right now, let's go ahead.
[02:33:57.262 --> 02:33:58.964]  You know, I'm teleprompter free and...
[02:34:00.328 --> 02:34:01.870]  I am makeup free.
[02:34:01.870 --> 02:34:11.980]  I don't put makeup on on TV, but I guess I really should because I look like a bowling ball, my head or something, and they're so shiny because the lights are so good and everything.
[02:34:11.980 --> 02:34:20.149]  You know, we are simulcasting also on the radio, TV at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:34:20.149 --> 02:34:22.852]  And the power of you, the people, of we the people.
[02:34:24.008 --> 02:34:29.878]  Taking that link and sending it to friends and family and neighbors and Facebook and Twitter is exponential and that's why!
[02:34:31.087 --> 02:34:42.049]  We're in the top six terrestrial radio shows, and you can say clearly, the number one political news talk show in the world by every major metric.
[02:34:42.049 --> 02:34:44.950]  Of course, the ultimate brass ring victory is in Politico today.
[02:34:44.950 --> 02:34:45.990]  It goes to Matt Drudge.
[02:34:45.990 --> 02:34:47.150]  Congratulations.
[02:34:47.150 --> 02:34:49.071]  This is about the 15th year running.
[02:34:49.071 --> 02:34:50.691]  I've seen that, I have to admit this.
[02:34:50.691 --> 02:34:55.892]  More traffic in political news and news in general than Facebook,
[02:34:57.718 --> 02:35:00.781]  And of course the New York Times and other publications combined.
[02:35:00.781 --> 02:35:05.306]  And Politico certainly doesn't like having to report that to everyone.
[02:35:05.306 --> 02:35:08.669]  That's a testament of the David versus Goliath.
[02:35:08.669 --> 02:35:09.369]  What does Drudge do?
[02:35:09.369 --> 02:35:16.576]  He links to government documents, he links to YouTube videos, he links to mainstream media, he links to alternative media.
[02:35:16.576 --> 02:35:20.180]  He just links to what's interesting and he's got his finger on the pulse of that.
[02:35:21.089 --> 02:35:22.949]  I mean, Drudge has been linking to us for 10 years.
[02:35:22.949 --> 02:35:28.771]  We were growing before we ever did that, but when Drudge links to us, half our traffic of the day is a Drudge link.
[02:35:28.771 --> 02:35:31.811]  So instead of getting a million visitors, we get two million visitors.
[02:35:31.811 --> 02:35:38.093]  And of course, if they whitewash it and say Drudge has two million original visitors a day, I'll give me a break.
[02:35:38.093 --> 02:35:41.873]  I can look at the metrics just on the Google Analytics alone.
[02:35:41.873 --> 02:35:44.594]  If we've got over a million visitors a day just to InfoWars,
[02:35:45.549 --> 02:35:51.133]  And I can see Drudge, he's probably getting 10 million individual visitors a day, conservatively.
[02:35:51.133 --> 02:35:56.776]  But again, so even when they admit he's number one, they give a little backhanded baloney slap.
[02:35:56.776 --> 02:35:58.638]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:35:58.638 --> 02:36:05.142]  Just like Alexa just delisted every libertarian and conservative site basically a year ago, now everybody just admits they're a joke.
[02:36:05.142 --> 02:36:07.443]  According to them, we have no viewers, no listeners, it's all over.
[02:36:07.443 --> 02:36:12.527]  Even though we're going straight up on the Google internal stuff and every other metric we've got.
[02:36:14.039 --> 02:36:14.821]  I don't want to digress.
[02:36:14.821 --> 02:36:18.348]  I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[02:36:18.348 --> 02:36:20.172]  And the caller just hung up from Colorado.
[02:36:20.172 --> 02:36:21.415]  I was going to go back to him.
[02:36:21.415 --> 02:36:22.377]  Kevin in Florida.
[02:36:22.377 --> 02:36:22.657]  Go ahead.
[02:36:22.657 --> 02:36:23.118]  You're on the air.
[02:36:25.891 --> 02:36:27.032]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:36:27.032 --> 02:36:29.894]  I just want to say me and my brother are huge supporters of your guys' show.
[02:36:29.894 --> 02:36:30.335]  Thank you.
[02:36:30.335 --> 02:36:34.678]  From the buying of the t-shirts to the hardcore nutraceuticals, which are awesome.
[02:36:34.678 --> 02:36:39.141]  I actually just took some Silver Bullet this morning from Nathan Ayanat as well.
[02:36:39.141 --> 02:36:39.762]  So they're awesome.
[02:36:39.762 --> 02:36:40.523]  We appreciate that.
[02:36:40.523 --> 02:36:40.963]  Thank you.
[02:36:40.963 --> 02:36:46.908]  But my question to you is about this whole cashless society thing.
[02:36:46.908 --> 02:36:53.813]  I realize now that a lot of companies are strictly going to where you have to get direct deposit or these ridiculous money cards.
[02:36:54.073 --> 02:36:54.653]  Great point.
[02:36:54.653 --> 02:37:05.581]  The big six banks, or the big five banks now, said two years ago they got a war on cash, they're going to phase it out, so they can then tax you corporately to even have money in their banks.
[02:37:05.581 --> 02:37:08.723]  And when you make a purchase, they're going to tax you a huge amount.
[02:37:08.723 --> 02:37:10.104]  So it's a huge scam.
[02:37:10.104 --> 02:37:11.645]  They're competing with cash.
[02:37:11.645 --> 02:37:16.688]  And yes, companies, businesses, corporations, they're trying to make you do automatic money transfers.
[02:37:16.688 --> 02:37:19.150]  They're trying to make you only use credit cards.
[02:37:19.150 --> 02:37:22.932]  Now businesses, big corporations, won't try to take a 20
[02:37:24.264 --> 02:37:31.209]  I don't usually go to Amazon, not Amazon, the coffee place with the stupid goddess.
[02:37:31.209 --> 02:37:32.070]  Starbucks, excuse me.
[02:37:32.070 --> 02:37:33.511]  I had one of those moments.
[02:37:33.511 --> 02:37:37.214]  I start trying to hurry to get to your calls and then I forget basic stuff.
[02:37:37.214 --> 02:37:40.377]  But I was in a small town with my kids.
[02:37:40.377 --> 02:37:41.117]  It was a Starbucks.
[02:37:41.117 --> 02:37:42.638]  It's better than McDonald's.
[02:37:42.638 --> 02:37:45.801]  I went there, got some milk and apples and stuff and I gave them a 50.
[02:37:45.801 --> 02:37:48.303]  And I was buying like $25 worth of stuff.
[02:37:48.303 --> 02:37:50.565]  A couple coffees, drinks, all that stuff.
[02:37:50.565 --> 02:37:52.106]  And they go, sir, do you have anything smaller?
[02:37:54.016 --> 02:37:56.622]  I said, this isn't a hundred, but a hundred isn't even what it used to be.
[02:37:56.622 --> 02:37:59.468]  They said, well sir, they don't even want us to take cash.
[02:37:59.468 --> 02:38:01.032]  And more and more that's what you see.
[02:38:01.032 --> 02:38:02.094]  So yeah, sorry, go ahead, Kevin.
[02:38:03.726 --> 02:38:04.926]  No, I agree.
[02:38:04.926 --> 02:38:16.309]  I recently found out too that a lot of the reasons, not just because of the reasons that you stated, but the corporations get major, major tax breaks if they do this, like you said, so they can tax it.
[02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:23.652]  And I think it's funny because me and my brother always joke about it, like the reactions that you get from other people when you spend with cash.
[02:38:23.652 --> 02:38:25.152]  I try and pay totally in cash.
[02:38:25.792 --> 02:38:26.372]  I'm good.
[02:38:41.192 --> 02:38:44.613]  Well, look at all the control with the credit card numbers getting stolen.
[02:38:44.613 --> 02:38:49.475]  I mean, every couple months they call up and go, your credit card's cancelled.
[02:38:49.475 --> 02:38:50.315]  It was compromised.
[02:38:50.315 --> 02:38:53.436]  I mean, that's probably happened five times this year.
[02:38:53.436 --> 02:38:57.038]  Everybody I know is having their accounts grabbed, stuff stolen.
[02:38:57.038 --> 02:39:01.279]  I mean, because it's designed to not work to make us go to biometrics.
[02:39:01.279 --> 02:39:05.461]  They admit that to thumb scan, face scan, when you use a card.
[02:39:05.461 --> 02:39:08.182]  So, absolutely, we've got to keep cash alive.
[02:39:08.182 --> 02:39:08.962]  We've got to use it.
[02:39:10.157 --> 02:39:15.800]  As much as we can because once they've gotten rid of cash, Katie, bar the door.
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:17.420]  I appreciate your call.
[02:39:17.420 --> 02:39:18.001]  Great point.
[02:39:18.001 --> 02:39:20.802]  Let's just take one more call and I'll have Anthony report his news.
[02:39:20.802 --> 02:39:24.684]  I'll get to news and come back to Brian, Jared, and Steve.
[02:39:24.684 --> 02:39:27.926]  But let's go to Gerald in Arkansas first.
[02:39:27.926 --> 02:39:28.586]  You're on the air.
[02:39:28.586 --> 02:39:30.387]  He wants to talk about a bank system scam.
[02:39:30.387 --> 02:39:30.687]  Go ahead.
[02:39:32.182 --> 02:39:40.347]  Well, the biggest scam, Alex, first, the Bible, I know you believe the Bible, the King James Version for me, but... Yes.
[02:39:40.347 --> 02:39:44.789]  ...verse 610, the love of money is the root of all evil.
[02:39:44.789 --> 02:39:50.553]  The problem is, our Founding Fathers said the only real money has to be backed by gold or silver.
[02:39:50.553 --> 02:39:51.814]  That's still in effect.
[02:39:51.814 --> 02:39:54.615]  Now, unless you amend the Constitution, that's not changed.
[02:39:54.615 --> 02:39:59.018]  So, no debt can be paid with fiat currency.
[02:39:59.525 --> 02:40:08.636]  So where we're at now, the digital age, Alex, and I know you know all this, but I don't think the public really gets it.
[02:40:08.636 --> 02:40:12.541]  And I'm talking about your followers and most everybody I've talked to.
[02:40:13.360 --> 02:40:22.026]  When you went to trillions, Alex, it blows the mind that people lose all perspective because you can't be real talking about trillions.
[02:40:22.026 --> 02:40:26.709]  There's not enough ink and paper to print that, so they get on a computer.
[02:40:26.709 --> 02:40:28.330]  What power that is!
[02:40:28.330 --> 02:40:29.711]  That's the biggest scam of all!
[02:40:45.001 --> 02:40:51.984]  Corporate devices, or corporate instruments, where they'll sell the same house a hundred times.
[02:40:51.984 --> 02:40:53.785]  Oh, but they don't get in trouble for fraud.
[02:40:53.785 --> 02:40:59.908]  The same big banks running the aircraft that ship the drugs, laundering the drug money, paying the hitmen.
[02:40:59.908 --> 02:41:09.753]  But when you go in, and you're going to buy dinner for, say, six, seven people you're with, and it's $75, and you give them $100, the waitress looks at you like you're Al Qaeda.
[02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:13.001]  This is legal tender, Peabrain.
[02:41:13.001 --> 02:41:14.482]  It says Federal Reserve on it.
[02:41:14.482 --> 02:41:19.065]  It is a fraud, but it's less of a fraud than the digital.
[02:41:19.065 --> 02:41:22.426]  So when they give me trouble about cash, baby, you get a speech.
[02:41:22.426 --> 02:41:24.788]  My kids used to go, oh, please, Dad.
[02:41:24.788 --> 02:41:27.529]  Now they give the speech.
[02:41:27.529 --> 02:41:29.050]  Or they'll check it to see if it's counterfeit.
[02:41:29.050 --> 02:41:31.811]  And I go, ma'am, all the money's counterfeit.
[02:41:31.811 --> 02:41:32.472]  They go, excuse me?
[02:41:32.472 --> 02:41:38.115]  And I go, well, you just marked my 50 or my 20 with a little marker to see if it's real.
[02:41:38.115 --> 02:41:39.936]  It's all Federal Reserve note.
[02:41:41.144 --> 02:41:42.305]  It should say U.S.
[02:41:42.305 --> 02:41:42.865]  note.
[02:41:42.865 --> 02:41:44.907]  Even that's fiat, but at least it's a U.S.
[02:41:44.907 --> 02:41:45.127]  note.
[02:41:45.127 --> 02:41:47.869]  Do you understand the Federal Reserve's private?
[02:41:47.869 --> 02:41:49.069]  And now people seem to know it.
[02:41:49.069 --> 02:41:50.030]  I appreciate your call.
[02:41:50.030 --> 02:41:50.911]  Great point, Gerald.
[02:41:50.911 --> 02:41:51.971]  Excellent point.
[02:41:51.971 --> 02:41:54.913]  We'll get to everybody else that's holding before the transmission ends.
[02:41:54.913 --> 02:41:58.216]  I've got a lot of news to cover in a short time to get there.
[02:41:58.216 --> 02:42:06.401]  Anthony Gucciardi is one of our health writers here, and I wanted him to come in because he was telling me about some amazing news developments he's going to be writing on.
[02:42:06.401 --> 02:42:08.963]  Anthony, tell us about some of these new developments.
[02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:15.648]  Well, there's a new study that anti-psychotic drugs actually shrink brain matter, and we'll talk about that a little bit.
[02:42:15.648 --> 02:42:18.231]  By the way, how many times have I said it shrinks your brain?
[02:42:18.231 --> 02:42:18.952]  A million times.
[02:42:18.952 --> 02:42:23.858]  But Ritalin really does it, Adderall really does it, it actually shrinks the brain up to one-third.
[02:42:23.858 --> 02:42:25.059]  It makes you feel like a total zombie.
[02:42:25.834 --> 02:42:29.136]  And we have a weird little story here that's interesting to me.
[02:42:29.136 --> 02:42:31.437]  Psychopaths may not yawn along with you.
[02:42:31.437 --> 02:42:32.878]  So you know how yawns are contagious?
[02:42:32.878 --> 02:42:38.561]  Apparently, psychopaths are so self-centered and their brains are so wired differently that they won't catch yawns.
[02:42:38.561 --> 02:42:39.942]  Is that called psychosomatic?
[02:42:39.942 --> 02:42:42.083]  When somebody farts, you want to fart?
[02:42:42.083 --> 02:42:43.463]  I'm sorry to be gross, but that's true.
[02:42:43.463 --> 02:42:44.964]  Or somebody burps, you want to burp?
[02:42:44.964 --> 02:42:46.125]  Or somebody yawns, you want to yawn?
[02:42:46.365 --> 02:42:49.307]  Yeah, it's all contagious because your brain... Somebody wants a Hillary, you can want a Hillary.
[02:42:49.307 --> 02:42:49.968]  You want a Hillary.
[02:42:49.968 --> 02:42:50.628]  That's what I want to do.
[02:42:50.628 --> 02:42:52.389]  I want to do the Hillary laugh.
[02:42:52.389 --> 02:42:54.711]  And then Alzheimer's disease may be infectious.
[02:42:54.711 --> 02:42:55.472]  We can get into that.
[02:42:55.472 --> 02:42:56.552]  That's pretty weird.
[02:42:56.552 --> 02:42:59.895]  Genetically modified embryos are essential for science.
[02:42:59.895 --> 02:43:03.777]  Experts and scientists want to start modifying human embryos.
[02:43:03.777 --> 02:43:06.179]  They've already done GMO babies and now they want to get embryos.
[02:43:06.179 --> 02:43:08.221]  And they've already been doing this for 30 years.
[02:43:08.221 --> 02:43:09.942]  They're just getting around to selling slaves right now.
[02:43:10.162 --> 02:43:20.747]  Remember that weird article that I actually have trouble finding now that we covered a long time ago about the chimeras, the secret chimeras in the UK that they were busting and stuff, like half-human weird monkey things and stuff like that?
[02:43:20.747 --> 02:43:23.509]  That was even in the Washington Post, too, about 12 years ago.
[02:43:23.509 --> 02:43:25.470]  And they've been doing that for who knows how long now.
[02:43:25.470 --> 02:43:28.011]  They're like, well, maybe we want to have GMO embryos.
[02:43:28.011 --> 02:43:28.971]  They've been doing it forever.
[02:43:28.971 --> 02:43:31.713]  But the thing is, it's going to be accepted publicly now.
[02:43:31.713 --> 02:43:34.214]  So it's going to be even bigger and more hardcore.
[02:43:34.214 --> 02:43:37.296]  Yeah, the Defense Department made humanities at least 30 years ago.
[02:43:37.296 --> 02:43:39.297]  That's even admitted in the congressional record.
[02:43:40.077 --> 02:43:41.979]  And then I tell people that and they roll their eyes.
[02:43:41.979 --> 02:43:44.901]  Folks, they can have a human spider if they want.
[02:43:44.901 --> 02:43:45.842]  Spider goat.
[02:43:45.842 --> 02:43:47.464]  Sure, that's like 25 years old.
[02:43:47.464 --> 02:43:48.905]  Yeah, but people still don't believe it.
[02:43:48.905 --> 02:43:49.646]  They think you're insane.
[02:43:49.646 --> 02:43:50.687]  They think you're making it up.
[02:43:50.687 --> 02:43:54.770]  By the way, I've read about that, but then I saw it in a Rochester newspaper.
[02:43:54.770 --> 02:43:55.711]  A listener sent it to us.
[02:43:55.711 --> 02:43:58.674]  One of our oldest affiliates is in Rochester, Dr. Wolf Station.
[02:44:01.900 --> 02:44:08.942]  I got the CEO of the Defense Department contract company on when no one knew about spider goats like 18 years ago.
[02:44:08.942 --> 02:44:11.002]  And people didn't believe it when he was on.
[02:44:11.002 --> 02:44:11.903]  They thought it was a hoax.
[02:44:11.903 --> 02:44:13.803]  I can say we broke spider goats.
[02:44:13.803 --> 02:44:16.884]  I've seen it in, you know, a local paper, but we broke it nationally.
[02:44:16.884 --> 02:44:20.125]  The Defense Department came to that guy and threatened he must do interviews anymore.
[02:44:20.125 --> 02:44:20.845]  Wow.
[02:44:20.845 --> 02:44:24.246]  So back then it was like Alex is making up part spider, part goat.
[02:44:24.346 --> 02:44:25.608]  And that was 18 years ago.
[02:44:25.608 --> 02:44:26.569]  Who knows what they're doing now?
[02:44:26.569 --> 02:44:29.212]  And you're still, you're still sound crazy though when you say spider goats.
[02:44:29.212 --> 02:44:30.694]  People will still tell you they don't exist.
[02:44:30.694 --> 02:44:34.919]  That's why I talk about spider goats a lot, is most people do know that's now around.
[02:44:34.919 --> 02:44:38.283]  But, I mean, they've got... Here's why they do it.
[02:44:38.283 --> 02:44:43.790]  If they take an embryo and splice it with a cow or a pig, 1%, they can claim it's not human, doesn't have rights.
[02:44:45.768 --> 02:45:08.858]  So, they're just trying to get us ready for the mainlining of this now, but I remember the Washington Post reported, and folks, I've tried to find it again, if you can find it, we'll send you a free t-shirt, or if somebody can find, it was about 17 years ago, this is the 14th anniversary of 9-11 coming up, so this was a few years before that, but 17 years ago, there was a Baltimore Sun article about DARPA,
[02:45:10.404 --> 02:45:17.606]  And I forget the headline, but it admitted that they were hooking up the cell towers and that they were practicing calming the public with wavelengths.
[02:45:17.606 --> 02:45:27.968]  Now we have the patents, but here they were saying the cell towers are making people submit and passive and putting them in a suggestive state.
[02:45:27.968 --> 02:45:32.849]  And I probably covered that article 20 times on air because I was mailed the actual Baltimore sign.
[02:45:32.849 --> 02:45:35.270]  I hope somebody can find that.
[02:45:35.270 --> 02:45:35.430]  Wow.
[02:45:36.482 --> 02:45:43.108]  I remember you talking about that, but I, yeah, it seems like for some reason, just like the Chimera article, the articles disappear.
[02:45:43.108 --> 02:45:44.969]  And it's obviously because they're deleted.
[02:45:44.969 --> 02:45:47.391]  But it's more challenging than you think to find something.
[02:45:47.391 --> 02:45:53.316]  That's like the San Francisco Chronicle went to a meeting eight years ago, nine years ago, we can check it.
[02:45:53.316 --> 02:45:57.420]  Just Google, uh, antimatter weapons, uh, San Francisco Chronicle.
[02:45:57.420 --> 02:46:00.602]  They edited the article, but they left some of it in there.
[02:46:00.602 --> 02:46:03.585]  And they went and they admitted, yeah, we have antimatter weapons.
[02:46:03.585 --> 02:46:04.546]  And we're developing more.
[02:46:05.540 --> 02:46:07.855]  And then they suddenly tried to classify all that.
[02:46:10.117 --> 02:46:19.023]  You know, think about all the stuff we know and times that by a billion, or as the caller earlier was saying, trillion is such an incapable number of understanding in our primate brains.
[02:46:19.023 --> 02:46:22.865]  Times what we already know they're doing, times a trillion, and that's what's really going on.
[02:46:22.865 --> 02:46:25.427]  And try and put that... You think it's that bad?
[02:46:25.427 --> 02:46:28.849]  I mean, if you think about the fact... They're acting so arrogant.
[02:46:28.849 --> 02:46:35.673]  They've broken into something or discovered something where it's like this world isn't even... It's like they're not even here anymore.
[02:46:35.673 --> 02:46:36.494]  The elite act like...
[02:46:37.611 --> 02:46:38.812]  This is nothing!
[02:46:38.812 --> 02:46:53.969]  They had computer-based systems in, what, the 60s and 50s, and we just... When my dad was at UT in the late 60s, they had CD-ROM systems that were, quote, restricted under DARPA, but he was allowed in as one of the higher level students, and they told him they had to sign agreements not to talk about it.
[02:46:54.289 --> 02:46:58.973]  And we were getting personal computers, which were super, super not powerful at all in the 90s.
[02:46:58.973 --> 02:47:02.397]  And now we're getting consumer-grade laptops and stuff like that.
[02:47:02.397 --> 02:47:07.041]  The technology that exists, it'll blow your mind.
[02:47:07.041 --> 02:47:08.723]  It's totally outlandish.
[02:47:08.723 --> 02:47:11.846]  Alright, now one reason I got you in here is the hourly plug.
[02:47:13.107 --> 02:47:19.157]  You are better at articulating why BrainForce has such great reviews, why the staff loves it, why it's clean energy.
[02:47:19.157 --> 02:47:21.821]  BrainForce, it helps fund the operation.
[02:47:21.821 --> 02:47:24.886]  I want to have the ultimate brain pill that blew away the competition for a lower price.
[02:47:24.886 --> 02:47:26.389]  Tell people what's in BrainForce.
[02:47:26.389 --> 02:47:26.709]  It's back.
[02:47:27.250 --> 02:47:31.814]  Alright, well BrainForce is probably one of my top favorite InfoWars Life products.
[02:47:31.814 --> 02:47:34.856]  I mean, it works, for me, in like 10 minutes.
[02:47:34.856 --> 02:47:40.301]  And what the difference is, though, some of these pills and energy drinks and shots and stuff, it's just a ton of concentrated caffeine.
[02:47:40.301 --> 02:47:46.726]  You feel terrible afterwards, you crash, you might get jittered up, kind of speedy for a little while, and then you feel bad afterwards.
[02:47:46.726 --> 02:47:49.589]  The difference is, these compounds work synergistically.
[02:47:49.589 --> 02:47:50.710]  I'm going to break them down a little bit.
[02:47:50.990 --> 02:47:57.312]  So if Alpha-GPC, which we always talk about in Europe, is a prescription medication.
[02:47:57.312 --> 02:48:05.534]  We're not making any claims here, but what it does is it's known to increase a compound known as acetylcholine, which is memory and learning functions, stuff like that.
[02:48:05.534 --> 02:48:12.356]  But that's just in addition to all these other things that are giving you energy, like the L-theanine, which is a key component in green tea that everyone probably knows about.
[02:48:12.356 --> 02:48:14.677]  It increases dopamine, the feel-good chemicals in the brain.
[02:48:15.337 --> 02:48:19.119]  And then we have theanine and natural caffeine from Yerba Mate leaf powder.
[02:48:19.119 --> 02:48:22.681]  Instead of putting a bunch of synthetic junk in there, we have Yerba Mate.
[02:48:22.681 --> 02:48:29.444]  Instead of drinking a ton of Yerba Mate, you take this pill, which works synergistically with the rest of it, and phosphatidylserine.
[02:48:29.444 --> 02:48:34.066]  The reason that BrainForce has been sold out for so long is this key component, phosphatidylserine.
[02:48:34.066 --> 02:48:36.127]  You're going to understand why in a second.
[02:48:36.127 --> 02:48:41.450]  So it works with the maintenance of the cells in the brain, but historically, people wanted this so bad.
[02:48:42.372 --> 02:48:45.854]  It was never in supply because they had to get it from cow brains.
[02:48:45.854 --> 02:48:46.915]  That's how powerful this is.
[02:48:46.915 --> 02:48:48.817]  They would go and extract it from cow brains.
[02:48:48.817 --> 02:48:51.218]  That's not safe because the sponge will form and stuff will fall off of it.
[02:48:51.218 --> 02:48:51.638]  Exactly.
[02:48:51.638 --> 02:48:55.441]  So we're not going to have that happen, but we found out a way to get it from cabbage.
[02:48:55.441 --> 02:49:01.986]  So we're harvesting it from cabbage, but since it's been transferred from the cow brain to cabbage, it's in such demand that the supplies are very limited.
[02:49:01.986 --> 02:49:04.768]  So we just finally got the phosphatidylserine back for the product.
[02:49:04.768 --> 02:49:06.008]  We refused to take it out.
[02:49:06.008 --> 02:49:07.169]  Still in the product.
[02:49:07.169 --> 02:49:10.972]  And the hyperzine A, which another time, I mentioned last time,
[02:49:11.252 --> 02:49:14.914]  I think Big Pharma is going to turn Hyperzine A into a prescription medication in the United States.
[02:49:14.914 --> 02:49:20.277]  They're already looking at it, so I don't know how much longer we can have it in this formula, but it is super powerful.
[02:49:20.277 --> 02:49:23.779]  It helps the nerves communicate with the muscles and everything like that in the brain.
[02:49:23.779 --> 02:49:26.940]  And then we have also B12, which you're all super familiar with.
[02:49:26.940 --> 02:49:33.624]  It promotes energy production and just helps work with these other ingredients to give you the synergistic formulation that is brain force.
[02:49:33.624 --> 02:49:35.725]  And we have an organic B12?
[02:49:35.725 --> 02:49:36.465]  Yes.
[02:49:36.465 --> 02:49:39.007]  We have the key, like the difference is,
[02:49:39.753 --> 02:49:42.294]  Because we always talk about, we're not going to go in and throw a synthetic junk.
[02:49:42.294 --> 02:49:46.777]  We could have just put synthetic caffeine in here, and it would have made you jittery, and it would have made you crash.
[02:49:46.777 --> 02:49:48.778]  But the difference is, these work together.
[02:49:48.778 --> 02:49:51.119]  It's not just an energy pill.
[02:49:51.119 --> 02:49:56.922]  It's something that works synergistically with your brain to give you the natural compounds you need to do what you want to do.
[02:49:56.922 --> 02:50:04.246]  Instead of firing you up, going crazy, and crashing down to earth, this gives you, I think, like a sustainable, warm type of drive.
[02:50:04.406 --> 02:50:11.408]  Oh, when we run out of it, I certainly notice that I take one in the morning and one about this time after I eat, instead of having my afternoon coffee.
[02:50:11.408 --> 02:50:12.689]  Yeah.
[02:50:12.689 --> 02:50:18.070]  Sometimes I still cheat and drink my afternoon coffee because I love coffee, but coffee doesn't work at night.
[02:50:18.070 --> 02:50:32.335]  Say when I'm doing a coast-to-coast AM show, and I've been up since 6 AM and I'm exhausted, but I'm excited to go on Georgia's show, I'll just pop a Brain Force at about 10, and then in a couple hours when the show comes up, I feel great until 3 when the show's over and I can go to bed.
[02:50:32.955 --> 02:50:36.036]  But if I've drunk four cups of coffee, then I can't go to bed at three in the morning.
[02:50:36.036 --> 02:50:38.397]  It's like it makes me awake, but I filter.
[02:50:38.397 --> 02:50:41.058]  So it's just a game changer, and it helps support the broadcast.
[02:50:41.058 --> 02:50:42.618]  Thank you all for purchasing it.
[02:50:42.618 --> 02:50:43.938]  It is BrainForce.

[02:50:58.943 --> 02:51:12.266]  So I found out the other day that at Guns80.com a lot of people don't get the Ghost AR-15 rifle kits because they're afraid that they won't be able to do the machining work required to drill out and make ready the lower.
[02:51:12.266 --> 02:51:16.647]  Well listen, guys, gals, I am not that good of a machinist, I promise you.
[02:51:16.647 --> 02:51:23.289]  But I was able to take a drill press with an XY table and knock this out in about 45 minutes and in all honesty, mine looks really good.
[02:51:23.289 --> 02:51:25.129]  Go get yours, don't be afraid, it's easy.

[02:52:16.865 --> 02:52:19.167]  Your email address will never be shared or sold.
[02:52:19.167 --> 02:52:21.328]  We'll never limit the number of boxes you can purchase.
[02:52:21.328 --> 02:52:24.731]  We'll never use outside packers or use relabeled food from another company.
[02:52:25.171 --> 02:52:33.633]  Our meals are naturally high in fiber, carbs and protein and everything is packed with oxygen absorbers and Mylar pouches under our direct supervision at our plant in Oregon.

[02:54:10.160 --> 02:54:14.785]  Final segment of the big three, but then a whole other fourth hour is coming up.
[02:54:14.785 --> 02:54:18.830]  Hosted by Rob Dew and some of the other reporters.
[02:54:18.830 --> 02:54:22.474]  David Knight is back in a few days from his well-deserved vacation.
[02:54:22.474 --> 02:54:24.777]  He will be hosting a lot of the fourth hour.
[02:54:24.777 --> 02:54:26.779]  I hosted 20 minutes of it yesterday.
[02:54:26.779 --> 02:54:28.701]  Some days I'll be hosting the entire fourth hour.
[02:54:29.602 --> 02:54:32.203]  And I'll be back this Sunday as well, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:54:32.203 --> 02:54:32.904]  Central.
[02:54:32.904 --> 02:54:36.906]  But he'll continue into the next hour getting to Matt, O'Brien, Ben, Steve and others.
[02:54:36.906 --> 02:54:39.007]  I'm going to get to some of you right now.
[02:54:39.007 --> 02:54:40.648]  Let's talk to Brian in Arizona.
[02:54:40.648 --> 02:54:41.348]  Thanks for calling.
[02:54:41.348 --> 02:54:41.688]  Go ahead.
[02:54:41.688 --> 02:54:44.650]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[02:54:44.650 --> 02:54:46.571]  Yes, sir.
[02:54:46.571 --> 02:54:47.772]  Yeah, I just wanted to call.
[02:54:47.772 --> 02:54:55.896]  I live in a small town out here in Arizona, and I'm seeing probably two to four drones a week flying over the valley.
[02:54:55.896 --> 02:54:58.077]  And I know the drones, I've zoomed in with my binoculars.
[02:54:59.119 --> 02:55:04.902]  And I've also been seeing Apaches flying around in formation, about 18 to 20 of them.
[02:55:04.902 --> 02:55:07.463]  And I just want to know what you know about that.
[02:55:07.463 --> 02:55:08.023]  Well, sure.
[02:55:08.023 --> 02:55:12.225]  Thank God they're actually putting troops on the border.
[02:55:12.225 --> 02:55:20.409]  The military, basically outside of Obama's orders, even though he's purged the military, is doing some reconnaissance of the border.
[02:55:21.328 --> 02:55:24.409]  That's the only place you should have military operations is the border.
[02:55:24.409 --> 02:55:26.931]  It's the only place that's constitutional.
[02:55:26.931 --> 02:55:30.612]  And basically they know there are ISIS operatives pouring across the border.
[02:55:30.612 --> 02:55:31.793]  The FBI has confirmed that.
[02:55:31.793 --> 02:55:33.534]  It's like they're pouring into Europe.
[02:55:34.962 --> 02:55:37.405]  And so we have multiple governments within governments.
[02:55:37.405 --> 02:55:39.527]  We have good government, we have bad government.
[02:55:39.527 --> 02:55:44.613]  The problem is, the bigger the government gets, the more corrupt it becomes historically.
[02:55:44.613 --> 02:55:56.205]  But I don't know the specifics of what you're seeing, but I know we're getting the same reports from our sources that there is increased military activity on the Texas-Arizona, California, you name it, border.
[02:55:58.991 --> 02:55:59.651]  Yeah.
[02:55:59.651 --> 02:56:00.411]  I don't know.
[02:56:00.411 --> 02:56:03.712]  I just see them circling straight around the town all day long.
[02:56:03.712 --> 02:56:05.553]  I don't know what they're looking for.
[02:56:05.553 --> 02:56:09.433]  And the other question was, do we know any more about chemtrails?
[02:56:09.433 --> 02:56:12.294]  Because I'm seeing them on a daily basis.
[02:56:12.294 --> 02:56:12.494]  Sure.
[02:56:12.494 --> 02:56:13.794]  Like a tic-tac-toe pattern.
[02:56:13.794 --> 02:56:13.994]  Sure.
[02:56:13.994 --> 02:56:15.235]  It's called geoengineering.
[02:56:15.235 --> 02:56:16.635]  There's a giant secret program.
[02:56:16.635 --> 02:56:18.295]  It's added to the jet fuel.
[02:56:18.295 --> 02:56:20.496]  Even the airlines up at the top aren't part of it.
[02:56:20.496 --> 02:56:21.896]  It's compartmentalized.
[02:56:21.896 --> 02:56:24.157]  That is to change the atmosphere of the planet.
[02:56:24.157 --> 02:56:24.517]  Look up
[02:56:26.345 --> 02:56:28.606]  Geoengineering, and then it's all public.
[02:56:28.606 --> 02:56:30.106]  Under the word chemtrail, there's nothing.
[02:56:30.106 --> 02:56:49.234]  It's kind of like, under FEMA camp, there's no FEMA camps, but under Emergency Centers Establishment Act, or under Resettlement Operations, or Internment Camp, you'll be at the Army website reading about how their main enemy's patriots, and it's just, people go there, and they just can't believe they're at army.mil, reading the most treasonous, whacked-out stuff you can imagine.
[02:56:49.234 --> 02:56:52.315]  That doesn't mean the military's bad, they're freaked out.
[02:56:52.315 --> 02:56:55.276]  But they are training, literally, to kill their grandfathers.
[02:56:55.936 --> 02:56:56.797]  I've been to the drills.
[02:56:56.797 --> 02:56:59.739]  You've heard the military call in at every drill.
[02:56:59.739 --> 02:57:04.802]  They got people that are good old boys, black, white, Hispanic, wearing John Deere hats going, I love America!
[02:57:04.802 --> 02:57:05.903]  I don't want to turn my guns in!
[02:57:05.903 --> 02:57:07.484]  And they mow you down.
[02:57:07.484 --> 02:57:15.710]  Until last year, then it started shifting to black people, where we got footage from the drills and it was just all black people being rounded up.
[02:57:15.710 --> 02:57:20.894]  And then we said, oh, they're getting ready to start a race war with the White House setting the black people up for the fall.
[02:57:21.932 --> 02:57:23.993]  I mean, it's just sick.
[02:57:23.993 --> 02:57:30.077]  You can even Google the video I shot, emergency alert, Pentagon training to intern black people.
[02:57:30.077 --> 02:57:31.597]  And then you notice all hell broke loose.
[02:57:31.597 --> 02:57:33.478]  I mean, it's so diabolical.
[02:57:33.478 --> 02:57:35.379]  Brian, God bless you.
[02:57:35.379 --> 02:57:38.861]  Listen, Steve and everybody else, due's gonna get to you.
[02:57:38.861 --> 02:57:40.082]  I have administrative duties.
[02:57:40.082 --> 02:57:40.582]  We've got a 27-hour.
[02:57:42.213 --> 02:57:43.395]  I guess this is the end of the fourth hour.
[02:57:43.395 --> 02:57:46.759]  It's a 28-hour broadcast kicking off next Wednesday.
[02:57:46.759 --> 02:57:49.583]  I haven't done one of these in three years.
[02:57:49.583 --> 02:57:51.125]  We're going to be doing it to launch.
[02:57:51.125 --> 02:57:54.730]  The fact that we are on TV satellites already, I'm going to unveil all the details.
[02:57:54.730 --> 02:57:56.772]  We've got a lot of special documentaries we've shot.
[02:57:57.333 --> 02:58:04.735]  In Europe and with Larry Nichols and with insiders that are going to be premiering during the Operation Money Bomb.
[02:58:04.735 --> 02:58:09.457]  Try to raise a million dollars, cost 400 plus thousand just for the satellite and closed captioning a year.
[02:58:09.457 --> 02:58:14.559]  Five hours of the proper satellite and the closed captioning is $120,000 a year, $10,000 a month.
[02:58:14.559 --> 02:58:18.120]  It's federal law, it's ridiculous, but it's political correctness!
[02:58:18.900 --> 02:58:31.965]  That's what's cost prohibitive about getting on TV, but we've got UHF and VHF and cable stations already picking it up around the country, so a lot of exciting things are happening right now.
[02:58:31.965 --> 02:58:34.986]  FourthHourInfoWars.com forward slash show.

[02:59:23.398 --> 02:59:27.559]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.

[02:59:51.098 --> 03:00:01.844]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.844 --> 03:00:08.467]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:08.467 --> 03:00:11.449]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.768 --> 03:00:20.350]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:20.350 --> 03:00:21.411]  We're in overdrive.
[03:00:21.411 --> 03:00:30.839]  If you are watching this on InfoWars.com forward slash show or on YouTube, please call your local radio station and ask them to carry the fourth hour of the show if they're not doing it.
[03:00:30.839 --> 03:00:34.202]  You can also, of course, watch it live at InfoWars.com forward slash show, like I just said.
[03:00:34.202 --> 03:00:37.965]  We're going to get to your calls here in this segment and part of the next.
[03:00:37.965 --> 03:00:39.346]  And so don't hang up.
[03:00:39.346 --> 03:00:42.189]  We got Ben, Roger and Matt coming up.
[03:00:42.189 --> 03:00:45.511]  And I'm going to get to some vaccine news that really blew my mind last night.
[03:00:46.532 --> 03:00:51.574]  And also talking about the garbage trucks that are going to start spying on you and what's going on in California.
[03:00:51.574 --> 03:01:00.837]  Because California leads the nation on these horrible trends of encroaching on your rights and liberties, claiming it's for the betterment of the greater good.
[03:01:00.837 --> 03:01:02.797]  But let's get to Matt in Colorado.
[03:01:02.797 --> 03:01:05.238]  You want to talk about Romans 13 and SSRI drugs.
[03:01:05.238 --> 03:01:05.678]  Go ahead.
[03:01:05.678 --> 03:01:07.579]  And by the way, David Knight is back today.
[03:01:07.759 --> 03:01:08.460]  That's right.
[03:01:08.460 --> 03:01:10.241]  Oh yeah, David Nottle being at the bottom of the hour.
[03:01:10.241 --> 03:01:12.303]  He's got an amazing TSA story.
[03:01:12.303 --> 03:01:14.625]  He got, his family got pulled aside.
[03:01:14.625 --> 03:01:15.566]  They were going to get groped.
[03:01:15.566 --> 03:01:16.727]  He's got this amazing story.
[03:01:16.727 --> 03:01:20.129]  We got some video of it that he shot yesterday at the airport.
[03:01:20.129 --> 03:01:25.474]  And he took a well-deserved, I guess it was about a week and a half vacation with his family.
[03:01:25.474 --> 03:01:30.258]  So I'm going to let him, we're going to talk about that a little bit and also some things that he saw while he was out west.
[03:01:30.258 --> 03:01:32.200]  But anyway, Matt in Colorado, go ahead.
[03:01:32.200 --> 03:01:34.341]  What's your question?
[03:01:34.341 --> 03:01:35.302]  Hey, can you hear me yet?
[03:01:35.302 --> 03:01:35.803]  I can hear you.
[03:01:35.803 --> 03:01:36.083]  Go ahead.
[03:01:37.574 --> 03:01:52.460]  Yeah, I actually wanted to talk about a few things, but I was put on Ritalin in third grade, and from the moment I was put on it, I was diagnosed with ADD, which I had a problem.
[03:01:52.460 --> 03:01:55.561]  Because you didn't like to sit still for eight hours a day in a classroom, right?
[03:01:55.561 --> 03:01:57.482]  That was your problem.
[03:01:57.482 --> 03:02:01.043]  I was fidgety, and I liked to play with toys, and I liked to build things.
[03:02:01.043 --> 03:02:01.684]  You were a kid?
[03:02:01.684 --> 03:02:04.985]  Yeah, that made me... Yeah, pretty much.
[03:02:04.985 --> 03:02:07.206]  But from the moment I was put on Ritalin,
[03:02:08.070 --> 03:02:13.714]  It basically made me feel pretty much suicidal all the time.
[03:02:13.714 --> 03:02:28.503]  I remember getting in arguments with my parents, you know, as kids would do, and telling them, you know, my default solution was, well, I'm just going to go kill myself, you know.
[03:02:28.503 --> 03:02:34.547]  And it wasn't until about 10th grade that I actually started refusing to take it.
[03:02:35.612 --> 03:02:38.093]  So you weaned yourself off of it?
[03:02:38.093 --> 03:02:41.133]  Yeah, pretty much.
[03:02:41.133 --> 03:02:44.294]  And how did you feel after you weaned yourself off of it?
[03:02:44.294 --> 03:02:44.934]  Oh, great.
[03:02:44.934 --> 03:02:57.917]  And actually my sister's, my nephew, her son was diagnosed with ADD a couple years ago and I begged her, I told her, do not put him on Ritalin.
[03:02:57.917 --> 03:02:59.737]  It will ruin your child's life.
[03:02:59.737 --> 03:03:00.357]  Don't do it.
[03:03:00.357 --> 03:03:03.978]  And so far she hasn't done it and he's one of the most
[03:03:04.648 --> 03:03:07.250]  Respectful, obedient kids.
[03:03:07.250 --> 03:03:08.090]  He plays football.
[03:03:08.090 --> 03:03:11.072]  He's great at football.
[03:03:11.072 --> 03:03:14.874]  I mean, he's probably one of the best behaved kids I've ever known.
[03:03:15.356 --> 03:03:30.450]  Yeah, you know when kids have an outlet for their energy, which an outlet for their energy is not sitting in school for eight hours a day, but when they're able to go out and play sports, or they're given constructive things to do, stuff to concentrate on, they're able to figure out how to use their mental abilities to their benefit.
[03:03:30.450 --> 03:03:36.656]  But when you're putting them on these drugs that are turning them into zombies, and they're sitting and watching TV or playing video games for hours,
[03:03:37.737 --> 03:03:39.599]  There's just no comparison of the two.
[03:03:39.599 --> 03:03:43.201]  And also, I think diet is also a big thing in these kids being hyperactive.
[03:03:43.201 --> 03:03:47.905]  You give the kids a lot of sugar, a lot of processed food, a lot of dyes, and they're going to act out.
[03:03:47.905 --> 03:03:50.547]  And then people are going to say, well, they have ADD, we've got to do something about it.
[03:03:50.547 --> 03:03:51.508]  Here's a drug.
[03:03:51.508 --> 03:03:53.710]  But you can still keep feeding them that crap.
[03:03:53.710 --> 03:03:54.791]  That's okay.
[03:03:54.791 --> 03:03:58.694]  So that's another thing you should also tell your sister.
[03:03:58.694 --> 03:03:59.935]  You know, look at his diet.
[03:03:59.935 --> 03:04:00.935]  What is she feeding him?
[03:04:00.935 --> 03:04:03.177]  That's another way to help that out.
[03:04:03.177 --> 03:04:03.958]  Matt, do you have anything else?
[03:04:05.461 --> 03:04:14.886]  Yeah, actually, I mean, my sister used to eat at McDonald's all the time, and now they're actually eating healthier, and you can see the change dramatically.
[03:04:14.886 --> 03:04:23.671]  And I also noticed, every time I look back on my childhood, all my elderlies would talk about how I love to build things and do this and that.
[03:04:24.255 --> 03:04:28.817]  And I noticed my nephew is the same way and I'm like, well you need to tune in to what they're good at.
[03:04:28.817 --> 03:04:30.417]  That child has ADD.
[03:04:30.417 --> 03:04:30.737]  Exactly.
[03:04:30.737 --> 03:04:32.458]  It's not a curse, it's a gift.
[03:04:32.458 --> 03:04:36.859]  It's a gift and you just need to... It's a gift of having lots of energy.
[03:04:36.859 --> 03:04:40.500]  It's having lots of energy, wanting to do things, be creative.
[03:04:40.500 --> 03:04:41.301]  Thank you for the call Matt.
[03:04:41.301 --> 03:04:44.542]  We're gonna be back with Ben, Eric, Roger and more.
[03:04:44.542 --> 03:04:47.042]  It's the Alex Jones Show 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:04:47.042 --> 03:04:47.983]  I'm Rob Dewey, your host.
[03:04:47.983 --> 03:04:48.623]  Thank you for watching.
[03:04:59.082 --> 03:05:02.084]  Let's talk about the real war on women.
[03:05:02.084 --> 03:05:04.925]  First wave feminism was a noble cause.
[03:05:04.925 --> 03:05:06.426]  But modern feminists?
[03:05:06.426 --> 03:05:06.946]  Ha!
[03:05:06.946 --> 03:05:14.870]  Well, instead of fighting for, say, paid and protected maternity leave, they want to ban words, shirts, and manspreading.
[03:05:15.330 --> 03:05:16.350]  Come on!
[03:05:16.350 --> 03:05:23.874]  That's cultural Marxism, which asserts that culture and language is responsible for oppressing women and not the state.
[03:05:23.874 --> 03:05:27.555]  The truth is, the state encourages gender wars.
[03:05:27.555 --> 03:05:31.937]  It's a divide-and-conquer tactic designed to keep us fighting amongst ourselves.
[03:05:31.937 --> 03:05:36.839]  In fact, the feminist movement was hijacked by the political class to exploit women.
[03:05:36.839 --> 03:05:40.841]  As the late Aaron Russo revealed, the Rockefellers bankrolled feminism.
[03:05:41.301 --> 03:05:47.923]  Not because they had any interest in women's rights, but because women in the workforce was the ultimate trifecta.
[03:05:47.923 --> 03:05:55.485]  The state collects more tax dollars, children are indoctrinated at an earlier age, and the traditional family structure destroyed.
[03:05:55.485 --> 03:05:58.266]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com
[03:05:58.766 --> 03:06:02.287]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:06:02.287 --> 03:06:10.528]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:06:10.528 --> 03:06:15.930]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[03:08:11.730 --> 03:08:13.292]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:13.292 --> 03:08:17.477]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:17.477 --> 03:08:21.562]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:25.771 --> 03:08:28.052]  We are in the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:08:28.052 --> 03:08:28.952]  I'm your host Rob Dew.
[03:08:28.952 --> 03:08:30.933]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:30.933 --> 03:08:41.697]  And if you're listening to this on your radio and you like to see what's going on, like to look at the articles, watch the videos we're going to be playing a little bit later, you can go to InfoWars.com forward slash show and watch the free live stream.
[03:08:41.697 --> 03:08:43.518]  Tell all your friends and family about it.
[03:08:43.518 --> 03:08:44.098]  It's free.
[03:08:44.098 --> 03:08:46.859]  You can watch it right there on your computer.
[03:08:46.859 --> 03:08:49.820]  And there's I'd say there's from live to that.
[03:08:49.820 --> 03:08:51.621]  It's about a four second delay.
[03:08:51.621 --> 03:08:54.102]  So you're only getting it's really four seconds.
[03:08:54.996 --> 03:08:57.658]  And that's about it, which I think is really amazing.
[03:08:57.658 --> 03:09:00.979]  Ben, you want to talk about big pharma and mass shootings.
[03:09:00.979 --> 03:09:03.200]  What's on your mind?
[03:09:03.200 --> 03:09:06.542]  Yeah, well, first of all, thanks for taking my call.
[03:09:06.542 --> 03:09:07.983]  I'm really enjoying the fourth hour.
[03:09:07.983 --> 03:09:09.263]  I am too.
[03:09:09.263 --> 03:09:11.925]  This has been great.
[03:09:11.925 --> 03:09:15.967]  Anyway, first of all, I wanted to say on the abortion issue that
[03:09:17.368 --> 03:09:29.457]  Infowars Life should probably consider maybe coming out with like a prenatal supplement or something like that because it's hard to be able to decipher which ones you can trust and which ones you can't trust.
[03:09:29.457 --> 03:09:31.418]  That's a very good idea.
[03:09:31.418 --> 03:09:37.323]  My wife's actually pregnant with our fourth child and she takes some really good prenatal vitamins.
[03:09:37.323 --> 03:09:39.664]  She did her research, but I totally agree with you.
[03:09:39.664 --> 03:09:41.045]  That's a great suggestion.
[03:09:41.045 --> 03:09:41.646]  Go on, continue.
[03:09:42.819 --> 03:09:55.331]  Yeah, I mean, well, my wife's a nurse and we're talking about having another kid, but she, you know, we have to plan around her having to get this flu shot or else, you know, being ostracized from the nursing community.
[03:09:55.331 --> 03:09:59.355]  So it's really tough to try and weigh the benefits and the risks.
[03:09:59.355 --> 03:10:05.942]  But it's coming up on the one year anniversary, the 22nd, of a friend of one of mine.
[03:10:05.942 --> 03:10:06.562]  You can look it up.
[03:10:07.808 --> 03:10:13.009]  Pushed her daughter out of the way of getting run over by a car in front of a Walgreens.
[03:10:13.009 --> 03:10:19.551]  And, you know, we started a or contributed to a GoFundMe page and everything else and raised a bunch of money for our family.
[03:10:19.551 --> 03:10:22.972]  But recently.
[03:10:22.972 --> 03:10:25.733]  You know, we were looking to get charges filed against this woman.
[03:10:26.477 --> 03:10:27.138]  I think so.
[03:10:49.622 --> 03:10:56.547]  It's the ruined families with the abuse of parents or, you know, children that are put on the ADHD medication like the last guy.
[03:10:56.547 --> 03:11:05.433]  I mean, according to that 92 New Zealand survey and then the follow-up studies, it's the vaccinations that caused ADHD in the first place.
[03:11:05.433 --> 03:11:08.796]  Or, you know, that's what they led, that's what the eventual conclusion was.
[03:11:10.217 --> 03:11:15.100]  Yeah, there's lots of studies that they've done in Europe looking at kids who are unvaccinated versus vaccinated.
[03:11:15.100 --> 03:11:19.923]  And I did a bunch of reports on this last year, just going over the numbers that they were seeing.
[03:11:19.923 --> 03:11:22.985]  And they were just polling families and saying, does your kid have allergies?
[03:11:22.985 --> 03:11:24.025]  Does your kid have ADHD?
[03:11:24.025 --> 03:11:24.786]  Were they vaccinated?
[03:11:25.126 --> 03:11:42.154]  And the ones that weren't vaccinated, it was drastically lower the amount of side effects that these kids had, because it's not just death or encephalopathy, whatever it's called, when you have encephalitis and you're having seizures of the brain, or febrile seizures.
[03:11:42.154 --> 03:11:43.195]  It's not those things.
[03:11:43.195 --> 03:11:45.376]  Those are really bad side effects, or autism.
[03:11:45.376 --> 03:11:46.216]  Those are really bad ones.
[03:11:46.216 --> 03:11:50.879]  There's a ton of other side effects that could be happening, and your kid probably has them.
[03:11:51.547 --> 03:11:53.088]  Does your kid have allergies?
[03:11:53.088 --> 03:12:00.472]  Does your kid, especially to certain foods, peanut allergies is specifically linked to certain vaccinations?
[03:12:00.472 --> 03:12:00.852]  So go ahead.
[03:12:02.718 --> 03:12:04.499]  Yeah, I mean, so that's basically it.
[03:12:04.499 --> 03:12:07.300]  We're coming up on the one year anniversary of her death.
[03:12:07.300 --> 03:12:09.180]  It's a really sad thing.
[03:12:09.180 --> 03:12:14.322]  You know, we dedicated our softball team to her and everything else because she was just a great person.
[03:12:14.322 --> 03:12:17.523]  And the person driving the car, what were they on?
[03:12:17.523 --> 03:12:19.804]  What were they taking?
[03:12:19.804 --> 03:12:21.904]  They didn't release the specifics.
[03:12:21.904 --> 03:12:23.405]  I don't know that.
[03:12:23.405 --> 03:12:26.286]  But I do know that that was the case.
[03:12:26.286 --> 03:12:27.766]  But nothing specific.
[03:12:27.766 --> 03:12:29.487]  No specific drug type or anything like that.
[03:12:30.325 --> 03:12:32.127]  But it was a, you know, it's a tragedy.
[03:12:32.127 --> 03:12:34.549]  This family is, you know, it's ruined forever.
[03:12:34.549 --> 03:12:35.389]  Yeah.
[03:12:35.389 --> 03:12:39.333]  You know, I mean, Big Pharma is not just about the mass shooters and everything else.
[03:12:39.333 --> 03:12:47.099]  It's about, you know, the families who are affected, you know, by these little conditions that people have to suffer through their entire lives.
[03:12:47.099 --> 03:12:49.941]  I mean, ADHD has been a struggle for me personally.
[03:12:49.941 --> 03:12:55.666]  I'm lucky now to have a job that, you know, where I, like the last guy said, I build stuff.
[03:12:55.666 --> 03:12:58.969]  I build machines that measure radiation.
[03:12:59.696 --> 03:13:03.118]  From a linear accelerator for cancer treatment.
[03:13:03.118 --> 03:13:07.400]  You know, I didn't make it through college because my ADHD just had a hold of me.
[03:13:07.400 --> 03:13:17.304]  But here I am doing this high level of work and it's because, you know, we have this opportunity, you know, with these manufacturing and, you know, assembly type jobs.
[03:13:17.304 --> 03:13:19.285]  That's perfect for ADHD.
[03:13:19.285 --> 03:13:21.846]  And then, you know, all of those are going overseas to China though.
[03:13:21.846 --> 03:13:26.028]  So it's a pretty grim picture, but overall, I think that, uh,
[03:13:26.957 --> 03:13:31.639]  But you can always get a job with Big Pharma selling this crap to kids and pushing it on other people.
[03:13:31.639 --> 03:13:35.921]  I mean, they seem to be set up to make profits at the expense of our health.
[03:13:35.921 --> 03:13:42.284]  And now that we have Obamacare, you're going to see more people getting prescribed this stuff on a mass scale.
[03:13:42.284 --> 03:13:43.724]  And that's what they want.
[03:13:43.724 --> 03:13:45.225]  They put out the metrics.
[03:13:45.225 --> 03:13:47.006]  They want over half of us medicated.
[03:13:47.346 --> 03:13:47.826]  Yeah, I had an idea.
[03:14:07.557 --> 03:14:08.037]  We're good to go.
[03:14:34.964 --> 03:14:35.144]  Yeah.
[03:14:35.144 --> 03:14:35.284]  Right.
[03:14:49.204 --> 03:14:51.326]  And they could be reaching all kinds of people.
[03:14:51.326 --> 03:14:54.370]  Every time they send an email, there's a link back to InfoWars.
[03:14:54.370 --> 03:14:55.891]  Right, that's in your auto signature.
[03:14:55.891 --> 03:14:59.655]  You can set that up on just about every email system that I know of.
[03:14:59.655 --> 03:15:03.119]  And one thing, if you guys want to pull up the computer that I have in here, get informed now.
[03:15:03.119 --> 03:15:04.921]  You can sign up for the InfoWars Insider.
[03:15:04.921 --> 03:15:06.002]  We send out an email
[03:15:07.123 --> 03:15:07.664]  I think so.
[03:15:27.105 --> 03:15:48.001]  Who's got a real strong constitutional mind and really tells it like it is, and he broke down yesterday how Obama, the secret behind his purging of the military officers, and it's because those guys did not, those guys did not take the oath to protect and serve the President, they take an oath to the Constitution, and that is where he doesn't like it.
[03:15:48.001 --> 03:15:50.343]  So anyway, continue on Roger, what else do you have?
[03:15:51.280 --> 03:15:58.344]  The point is that every time you send out an email, there could be a link back to InfoWars, or to InfoWars Show, or whatever.
[03:15:58.344 --> 03:16:01.746]  And, you know, you could also do this, for example, if you post on the Internet.
[03:16:01.746 --> 03:16:07.689]  I mean, virtually everyone's posting, and they've got some kind of a signature line, even on Facebook, on these social media.
[03:16:07.689 --> 03:16:16.654]  Every time you post on the Internet, every time you send an email, it could say, like, sincerely, Rob Do, you know, visit InfoWars.com, and all they have to do is click the link.
[03:16:16.654 --> 03:16:18.335]  People are going to click it out of curiosity.
[03:16:19.068 --> 03:16:27.618]  And the thing is, so you could have someone in the course of just doing their normal day's work, they could be sending out 10, 20 links to the show.
[03:16:27.618 --> 03:16:35.968]  And when people are just, it's a normal email that people are naturally reading, you know, from a friend to a friend or to, you know, family members or, you know, something like that.
[03:16:36.807 --> 03:16:37.328]  I think so.
[03:16:55.200 --> 03:17:05.892]  And people trust what they hear from their friends more than they trust especially what they see from the mainstream media out there because, you know, I think a lot of people have gotten the hint that the mainstream media doesn't have their best interests at heart.
[03:17:05.892 --> 03:17:07.434]  Thank you for that call, Roger.
[03:17:07.434 --> 03:17:09.216]  That's a great suggestion and people should do that.
[03:17:10.077 --> 03:17:14.779]  Open up your auto signature, put InfoWars.com, put a little tagline in there.
[03:17:14.779 --> 03:17:16.680]  Do you know what the government's doing to you today?
[03:17:16.680 --> 03:17:18.201]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[03:17:18.201 --> 03:17:23.784]  Now I want to switch gears real quick and just cover some articles that came out of a newspaper called The Daily Nation.
[03:17:23.784 --> 03:17:26.786]  I've got actually six articles from them right now.
[03:17:26.786 --> 03:17:31.528]  The first came out two days ago, and this is a developing story that's going on.
[03:17:31.528 --> 03:17:32.248]  Here's the headline.
[03:17:32.248 --> 03:17:36.951]  Panic as two children die, seven in critical condition, after measles vaccine.
[03:17:37.851 --> 03:17:44.714]  And this is seven children in Curio Valley Hospital hospitalized, hundreds of others recalled to medical centers for observation.
[03:17:44.714 --> 03:17:51.157]  Two children died on Tuesday and seven were hospitalized in serious condition after receiving the measles vaccine in the Curio Valley.
[03:17:52.764 --> 03:17:53.244]  We're good to go.
[03:18:13.379 --> 03:18:15.179]  And then, and I said, I wonder who they're going to blame.
[03:18:15.179 --> 03:18:16.780]  They're not going to blame the vaccine.
[03:18:16.780 --> 03:18:21.900]  And then I did some searching and, oh, look, children who died after measles vaccine were injected by a cleaner.
[03:18:21.900 --> 03:18:26.381]  So they're, they're blaming it on the cleaning person now.
[03:18:26.381 --> 03:18:28.962]  They're, they're going to get thrown under the bus.
[03:18:28.962 --> 03:18:32.422]  Two children died after, were injected by a cleaner, the government said on Wednesday.
[03:18:32.422 --> 03:18:38.443]  Director of Medical Services said the housekeeper, the ones from Cleaner House, has worked at the health center for more than eight years.
[03:18:38.443 --> 03:18:41.604]  And it seems he has treated patients before the man has been arrested.
[03:18:42.484 --> 03:18:42.885]  I don't
[03:19:05.504 --> 03:19:09.829]  The vaccine that was causing these children to die, so it seems, especially from this article.
[03:19:09.829 --> 03:19:14.715]  But now, pathologists launch investigation into Cario Valley measles death.
[03:19:14.715 --> 03:19:24.987]  A team of government pathologists from Nairobi were on Wednesday sent to the Cario Valley to carry out investigations into Tuesday's mysterious death of two minors after a botched measles vaccination.
[03:19:26.087 --> 03:19:31.251]  And this is the mother of, here's a picture of the mother of one of the kids who died.
[03:19:31.251 --> 03:19:32.792]  Really horrible stuff.
[03:19:32.792 --> 03:19:35.233]  And it gets even worse after this.
[03:19:35.233 --> 03:19:46.701]  And of course the church in that area is speaking out against vaccinations and of course they're coming under fire from the local governments because the plan is to vaccinate the third world population vigorously.
[03:19:46.701 --> 03:19:50.224]  And what Bill Gates says, he hopes to reduce population by 10%.
[03:19:50.224 --> 03:19:51.885]  So he just admits it right there at a TED Talk.
[03:19:52.545 --> 03:19:53.746]  And we'll be back with more.
[03:19:53.746 --> 03:19:55.246]  I've got more vaccination news.
[03:19:55.246 --> 03:19:56.827]  We're going to have David Knight in studio.

[03:20:29.235 --> 03:20:42.563]  So I found out the other day that at Guns80.com a lot of people don't get the Ghost AR-15 rifle kits because they're afraid that they won't be able to do the machining work required to drill out and make ready the lower.
[03:20:42.563 --> 03:20:46.966]  Well listen, guys, gals, I am not that good of a machinist, I promise you.
[03:20:46.966 --> 03:20:53.590]  But I was able to take a drill press with an X-Y table and knock this out in about 45 minutes and in all honesty, mine looks really good.
[03:20:53.590 --> 03:20:55.431]  Go get yours, don't be afraid, it's easy.

[03:24:19.775 --> 03:24:25.456]  We are back live with the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, also known as InfoWars Live.
[03:24:25.456 --> 03:24:32.858]  I'm your host Rob Doo, and I have David Knight here at the bottom of the hour talking about his adventures in TSA land.
[03:24:32.858 --> 03:24:35.678]  And we also might get to this article from Activist Post.
[03:24:35.678 --> 03:24:40.379]  Garbage trucks begin recording license plates, or to begin recording license plates for law enforcement.
[03:24:40.379 --> 03:24:43.880]  This is a plan going on in California to have the garbage man spying on you.
[03:24:44.520 --> 03:24:47.763]  It's not bad enough they go through your garbage every once in a while and they're looking for evidence.
[03:24:47.763 --> 03:24:52.608]  Now they're gonna have the garbage men with little cameras mounted on them to spy on you.
[03:24:52.608 --> 03:24:54.149]  We're gonna get to that all in one second.
[03:24:54.149 --> 03:24:57.553]  I want to continue back with this vaccination news.
[03:24:57.553 --> 03:25:02.518]  Now the reason the church is speaking out against these vaccines goes back to earlier in the summer.
[03:25:03.942 --> 03:25:09.285]  Here's an article, actually earlier than that, here's an article from February 8th, 2015.
[03:25:09.285 --> 03:25:16.350]  Polio, let's see, polio vaccination begins despite protests from Catholic Church.
[03:25:16.350 --> 03:25:27.136]  And nearly 6 million children in 32 counties will be vaccinated against polio despite the Catholic Church asking parents to boycott the exercise over concerns of safety of the vaccine.
[03:25:27.136 --> 03:25:33.440]  The controversy is similar to one that happened last year when the Catholic Church raised a storm over a tetanus vaccination, which they claim caused sterility in women.
[03:25:34.605 --> 03:25:50.158]  Dr. Karnja said the polio vaccine, which is not like the old ones used for routine vaccination exercise and available in any hospital, is laced with an active ingredient, a hormone that if injected into children will affect their growth and reproductive abilities.
[03:25:50.158 --> 03:25:53.281]  He says it is not like the ones used for routine, but it is laced.
[03:25:53.281 --> 03:25:55.382]  So they're claiming it's got some kind of
[03:25:56.303 --> 03:26:00.365]  Well, population control mechanism built into it, which is what Bill Gates has said.
[03:26:00.365 --> 03:26:04.466]  You can go to any of our videos and look up Bill Gates and vaccination.
[03:26:04.466 --> 03:26:09.608]  I think we even questioned him about it when he came here in Austin a few years ago.
[03:26:09.608 --> 03:26:12.890]  But hey, a lab tested it and declared the polio vaccine safe.
[03:26:13.857 --> 03:26:15.958]  So these are all from the Daily Nation.
[03:26:15.958 --> 03:26:17.859]  This is an African website.
[03:26:17.859 --> 03:26:26.145]  And the polio vaccine currently being administered to children under the age of five is safe, the National Quality Control Laboratory has said.
[03:26:26.145 --> 03:26:28.726]  But why were people, why was the church speaking out against it?
[03:26:28.726 --> 03:26:29.507]  Why were people mad?
[03:26:30.694 --> 03:26:31.715]  Here we go.
[03:26:31.715 --> 03:26:33.137]  This is in July 28th.
[03:26:33.137 --> 03:26:37.663]  Checkups begin after Busia children paralyzed after jabs.
[03:26:37.663 --> 03:26:39.245]  Oh, look at that.
[03:26:39.245 --> 03:26:41.448]  Polio vaccine causes polio.
[03:26:41.448 --> 03:26:42.890]  Who'd have thunk it?
[03:26:42.890 --> 03:26:47.055]  30 children who were paralyzed after being injected at a dispensary in Busia
[03:26:47.892 --> 03:26:48.432]  Go back to this.
[03:26:48.432 --> 03:26:50.853]  This is what happens if you don't get your kids vaccinated.
[03:27:12.031 --> 03:27:18.214]  Dr. Ego criticized religious leaders opposed to the campaign saying they're being insincere and were misleading to the public.
[03:27:18.214 --> 03:27:22.436]  He warned parents of dire consequences if they failed to take their children for vaccination.
[03:27:22.436 --> 03:27:28.099]  We will arrest and prosecute all the parents who will deny their children the vaccine, he said.
[03:27:28.099 --> 03:27:32.902]  So, and he said, he said religious leaders don't have the right to mislead the public.
[03:27:33.587 --> 03:27:37.208]  And all they're doing is going, hey, look, these kids were paralyzed.
[03:27:37.208 --> 03:27:38.768]  We want an investigation.
[03:27:38.768 --> 03:27:40.729]  And they're going, shut up and take the vaccine.
[03:27:40.729 --> 03:27:42.449]  Just shut up and get in line.
[03:27:42.449 --> 03:27:49.851]  Bill Gates wants these vaccines sent to all the kids and injected because he needs a 10% reduction in population.
[03:27:49.851 --> 03:27:54.432]  In fact, if you guys can find it, it's a TED Talk where he says that, if you can find that.
[03:27:55.054 --> 03:28:04.759]  And now, it's not just Africa, it's not just last week when we covered, well, we thought it was Mexico, but it was Colombia, where the girls were flailing about for getting their HPV vaccine.
[03:28:04.759 --> 03:28:06.079]  Here it is in Vietnam.
[03:28:06.079 --> 03:28:12.122]  Seventh infant death after Vietnam brings back controversial vaccine Quinvaxim.
[03:28:12.122 --> 03:28:22.668]  A three-month-old boy died in the Central Highlands on Thursday, soon after he was given Quinvaxim, a controversial 5-in-1 vaccine that Vietnam suspended for five months in 2013 following several infant deaths.
[03:28:23.368 --> 03:28:26.210]  He became very weak and turned pale a few hours later.
[03:28:26.210 --> 03:28:29.833]  He died soon after they brought him to a local hospital.
[03:28:29.833 --> 03:28:33.736]  Local health officials said around 20 other babies received the shots and they were fine.
[03:28:33.736 --> 03:28:39.180]  So, you know, only a 1 in 20 cause of death there, it looks like.
[03:28:39.180 --> 03:28:43.484]  It is the WHO pre-qualified the drug and said it's much cheaper than alternatives.
[03:28:43.484 --> 03:28:44.885]  That's right, it gets the job done.
[03:28:45.837 --> 03:28:54.688]  The Health Ministry suspended the vaccine on May 4, 2013 after nine infants died between November 2012 and March 2013.
[03:28:54.688 --> 03:28:59.073]  Six infant deaths since Quinvaxin was brought back have not been linked to the vaccine either.
[03:28:59.073 --> 03:29:00.555]  So, nothing to worry about.
[03:29:00.555 --> 03:29:01.696]  It's not the vaccine.
[03:29:01.696 --> 03:29:04.960]  We can't ever talk about our precious vaccines.
[03:29:06.431 --> 03:29:18.452]  Because then we might have to admit that there's something wrong with them and then we might have to do real investigations and actually call for real studies of these things and then look at all the side effects and look at what parents are really saying after their kids
[03:29:20.393 --> 03:29:32.405]  Get the shots, because when we were taking calls a couple weeks ago about that, there's the young girls in Carmen del Bolivar in Colombia, all having seizures after they received the loving Gardasil shot.
[03:29:32.405 --> 03:29:39.952]  After the break, we're going to have David Knight in here talking about his adventures with the TSA, and I'm going to get to the spying garbage trucks and more news.
[03:29:39.952 --> 03:29:42.675]  It's the InfoWars.com Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:42.675 --> 03:29:43.235]  We are live.
[03:29:43.235 --> 03:29:44.757]  It's the fourth hour, and I'm your host, Rob Duke.

[03:30:00.370 --> 03:30:05.873]  There's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now.
[03:30:05.873 --> 03:30:11.255]  And if you're wondering how on earth we ever got in this situation, well I'll tell you how.
[03:30:11.255 --> 03:30:17.278]  When the Democrats showed their true colors, you got angry and you elected Republicans.
[03:30:17.278 --> 03:30:22.521]  And then when the Republicans showed their true colors, you got angry and elected Democrats.
[03:30:22.961 --> 03:30:33.630]  And when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt and that neither side were looking out for your best interest, you acted like they were crazy.
[03:30:33.630 --> 03:30:41.336]  But the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
[03:30:41.836 --> 03:30:48.124]  That's why it is vitally important that you wake up, America, and break the matrix.
[03:30:48.124 --> 03:30:53.491]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Show.

[03:33:00.822 --> 03:33:03.552]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:33:03.552 --> 03:33:06.343]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:15.348 --> 03:33:18.651]  We are live here in the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:33:18.651 --> 03:33:22.694]  I'm your host Rob Dew and riding shotgun over here is David Knight.
[03:33:22.694 --> 03:33:28.138]  He is a co-host of InfoWars Nightly News, sits in the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:28.138 --> 03:33:35.344]  Yeah, he's always, always in and he got a well-deserved vacation, except at the end he had to be hassled by the TSA.
[03:33:35.344 --> 03:33:38.647]  No vacation is quite proper without the TSA, right?
[03:33:38.647 --> 03:33:42.850]  Yeah, there were a couple of events right at the end of the vacation that got my blood pressure up.
[03:33:42.850 --> 03:33:43.191]  Yeah.
[03:33:43.191 --> 03:33:44.732]  It's like, well, it's time to get back to work.
[03:33:45.032 --> 03:33:53.615]  Well, before we get to that, I want to talk about this article that came out yesterday from Brandon Smith, and I think you're going to try to get him on the show on the nightly news tomorrow.
[03:33:53.615 --> 03:33:57.377]  Economic crisis, how you can prepare over the next six months.
[03:33:57.377 --> 03:33:58.417]  This is a great article.
[03:33:58.417 --> 03:34:01.238]  It's got some really, really good practical information in it.
[03:34:03.686 --> 03:34:07.610]  It just talks about how to find two family members, two friends, and one neighbor of like mind.
[03:34:07.610 --> 03:34:09.151]  And then you guys start developing a plan.
[03:34:09.151 --> 03:34:11.474]  Approach your church, veterans hall, or other organization.
[03:34:11.474 --> 03:34:12.595]  Learn a trader skill.
[03:34:12.595 --> 03:34:13.796]  Do you know how to work on cars?
[03:34:13.796 --> 03:34:14.557]  Do you know how to weld?
[03:34:14.557 --> 03:34:16.419]  Do you know how to use power tools?
[03:34:16.419 --> 03:34:17.820]  Do you know how to use hand tools?
[03:34:17.820 --> 03:34:18.821]  I mean, there's a lot of things.
[03:34:18.821 --> 03:34:19.622]  Do you know first aid?
[03:34:19.622 --> 03:34:26.208]  There's a lot of skills that can be useful whenever there's an economic collapse or societal breakdown.
[03:34:26.208 --> 03:34:27.790]  Rather than just staring at your smartphone.
[03:34:27.950 --> 03:34:28.730]  That's right.
[03:34:28.730 --> 03:34:33.232]  That's not really a good skill because it's not going to last very long if the power ever goes out.
[03:34:33.232 --> 03:34:36.753]  Commit to a rifle training course at least once a week.
[03:34:36.753 --> 03:34:38.514]  Create a local HAM network.
[03:34:38.514 --> 03:34:41.355]  Learn basic emergency combat medical response.
[03:34:41.355 --> 03:34:42.735]  And I like this one here.
[03:34:42.735 --> 03:34:46.037]  Store at least one year of food and then store extra.
[03:34:46.037 --> 03:34:48.337]  So get a year of food and then get more.
[03:34:48.337 --> 03:34:50.278]  And we had a great guest on today.
[03:34:50.278 --> 03:34:55.180]  We're coming out with a new line, InfoWarsSelect.com, and they're having
[03:34:55.660 --> 03:34:56.280]  We're good to go.
[03:35:12.466 --> 03:35:14.788]  And they're all built with Ziploc, so nothing goes to waste.
[03:35:14.788 --> 03:35:18.451]  And you can find all the information there at InfoWareSelect.com.
[03:35:18.451 --> 03:35:27.339]  I definitely have several years worth of food, and the older stuff I had actually gave to my parents, and then I upgraded with more.
[03:35:27.339 --> 03:35:27.859]  What about you?
[03:35:27.859 --> 03:35:29.060]  That's impressive.
[03:35:29.060 --> 03:35:30.161]  I've only got a few months.
[03:35:30.161 --> 03:35:33.024]  I need to get more, because I don't have anywhere close to a year.
[03:35:34.344 --> 03:35:40.267]  I also have the water filter, the probe here, that you don't need electricity to filter your water.
[03:35:40.267 --> 03:35:42.828]  And I have rainwater collected all over my house.
[03:35:42.828 --> 03:35:44.989]  Because if gravity goes away, we're really messed up.
[03:35:44.989 --> 03:35:45.629]  Exactly.
[03:35:45.629 --> 03:35:47.370]  Yeah, if gravity goes away, we're screwed.
[03:35:47.370 --> 03:35:48.850]  But right now, we still have gravity.
[03:35:48.850 --> 03:35:49.671]  It filters the water.
[03:35:50.211 --> 03:35:57.718]  ProPure, Infowarselect.com is the one-two punch to at least be able to take care of your friends and family during a crisis.
[03:35:57.718 --> 03:36:01.722]  And it might not be economic collapse, it could be an earthquake in your area.
[03:36:01.722 --> 03:36:03.804]  It could be a power plant blows up.
[03:36:03.804 --> 03:36:06.827]  It could be maybe a nuclear incident in one of these power plants.
[03:36:06.827 --> 03:36:10.591]  It could be the EPA releasing chemicals into the water supply like they did out west.
[03:36:10.731 --> 03:36:14.032]  Yeah, you know, there's a lot of farmers that weren't able to water their crops.
[03:36:14.032 --> 03:36:15.612]  They were afraid to drink it.
[03:36:15.612 --> 03:36:17.192]  And that's a major disaster.
[03:36:17.192 --> 03:36:18.312]  And it was created by the government.
[03:36:18.312 --> 03:36:19.753]  Created by the government.
[03:36:19.753 --> 03:36:23.673]  And it was actually predicted by a guy who lives in Farmington.
[03:36:23.673 --> 03:36:24.654]  He actually wrote an op-ed.
[03:36:24.654 --> 03:36:26.994]  I tried tracking him down, but I think he's still on vacation.
[03:36:26.994 --> 03:36:27.894]  He wrote this op-ed.
[03:36:27.894 --> 03:36:31.495]  He was so pissed off that he goes, what the EPA is going to do is cause a disaster.
[03:36:31.495 --> 03:36:33.955]  And then they're going to go, here is our solution.
[03:36:33.955 --> 03:36:37.696]  It's to build a giant cleanup center worth multi-millions of dollars.
[03:36:37.756 --> 03:36:39.016]  Well, he wasn't just theorizing.
[03:36:39.016 --> 03:36:47.558]  He'd been an engineer for 40 some odd years, and he said what they're doing is guaranteed to cause an explosion and a release of these materials.
[03:36:47.558 --> 03:36:48.618]  And then I'll tell you what they're going to do.
[03:36:48.618 --> 03:36:52.739]  They're going to use this as an excuse to expand their own power system.
[03:36:52.739 --> 03:36:53.599]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:36:53.599 --> 03:36:53.899]  Exactly.
[03:36:53.899 --> 03:36:54.659]  That's what they did.
[03:36:54.659 --> 03:36:56.500]  So tell me a little bit about your vacation.
[03:36:56.500 --> 03:36:58.200]  You just got back.
[03:36:58.200 --> 03:36:59.100]  Very well deserved.
[03:36:59.100 --> 03:37:01.100]  You took over for Alex while he was gone.
[03:37:01.100 --> 03:37:02.461]  You're covering all those days.
[03:37:02.461 --> 03:37:03.781]  Plus, we had the nightly news.
[03:37:04.141 --> 03:37:08.126]  Well, we just took an opportunity to relax in the Pacific Northwest.
[03:37:08.126 --> 03:37:09.768]  I'd never really seen it in much detail.
[03:37:09.768 --> 03:37:11.030]  It's nice and cool up there.
[03:37:11.030 --> 03:37:11.530]  Oh, it was nice.
[03:37:11.530 --> 03:37:12.572]  That was a prerequisite.
[03:37:12.572 --> 03:37:14.034]  We had to go somewhere where it was cool.
[03:37:14.034 --> 03:37:16.156]  We wanted to see the redwood forests.
[03:37:16.156 --> 03:37:18.940]  And my sons and daughter had never seen that before.
[03:37:18.940 --> 03:37:20.682]  So we went into Portland.
[03:37:21.403 --> 03:37:22.703]  Looked around Oregon.
[03:37:22.703 --> 03:37:23.964]  It was very beautiful.
[03:37:23.964 --> 03:37:32.366]  Looked at the waterfalls, the Columbia River Gorge, and we went down, saw the Redwood Forest, went up to the Olympia Peninsula, saw the rainforest up there, saw Mount St.
[03:37:32.366 --> 03:37:32.726]  Helens.
[03:37:32.726 --> 03:37:33.746]  So we did a lot of driving.
[03:37:33.746 --> 03:37:34.506]  It was a very nice trip.
[03:37:34.506 --> 03:37:34.946]  Mount St.
[03:37:34.946 --> 03:37:36.006]  Helens looks interesting.
[03:37:36.006 --> 03:37:38.447]  It looks like somebody took a big bite out of that mountain.
[03:37:38.447 --> 03:37:39.447]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:37:39.447 --> 03:37:44.648]  And right there where they... Johnston was one of the guys from the U.S.
[03:37:44.648 --> 03:37:47.209]  Geological Service that was killed that day that exploded.
[03:37:47.369 --> 03:37:49.570]  Is he the one taking the photographs and saying, this is it?
[03:37:49.570 --> 03:37:53.813]  Yeah, they've been warning people, but they were completely surprised by the magnitude.
[03:37:53.813 --> 03:37:56.495]  It was way, way bigger than anything that it expected.
[03:37:56.495 --> 03:38:00.518]  So he was there observing, and of course a blast zone went.
[03:38:01.425 --> 03:38:02.206]  Many, many miles.
[03:38:02.206 --> 03:38:07.189]  I forget how many miles it was, but it's absolutely incredible because they have markers where the blast zone went to.
[03:38:07.189 --> 03:38:12.614]  And the outer edge of the blast zone, they now have trees that are 30, 35 years old, but still around Mount St.
[03:38:12.614 --> 03:38:14.295]  Helens, nothing has grown back.
[03:38:14.295 --> 03:38:14.515]  Wow.
[03:38:14.515 --> 03:38:16.937]  So, and you can see where they built this monument there.
[03:38:16.937 --> 03:38:20.019]  You can see where the mountain blew out and came towards him.
[03:38:20.019 --> 03:38:21.300]  It was eight miles away.
[03:38:21.300 --> 03:38:22.841]  It reached him within 40 seconds.
[03:38:22.841 --> 03:38:23.882]  That's how fast it was traveling.
[03:38:23.942 --> 03:38:26.863]  And that is not the only active volcano in that area.
[03:38:26.863 --> 03:38:27.404]  No.
[03:38:27.404 --> 03:38:27.964]  I think there's like 13.
[03:38:27.964 --> 03:38:34.227]  There's a few that are dormant, but in that area it's very active and it has to do with the tectonic plates out in the Pacific.
[03:38:34.227 --> 03:38:37.928]  And it was minuscule compared to the caldera that's at Yellowstone.
[03:38:37.928 --> 03:38:38.509]  Right.
[03:38:38.509 --> 03:38:39.569]  Absolutely tiny.
[03:38:39.569 --> 03:38:43.731]  Many, many orders of magnitude smaller than what Yellowstone is.
[03:38:43.731 --> 03:38:44.711]  There you go.
[03:38:44.711 --> 03:38:51.955]  And so now you had a great vacation, you're back at the airport, about to fly back, and of course the TSA had to jump in and
[03:38:52.742 --> 03:38:55.603]  Well, you know, Rob, we always opt out as a family.
[03:38:55.603 --> 03:38:56.763]  I always opt out.
[03:38:56.763 --> 03:38:59.444]  I've had situations where we had to opt out and film.
[03:38:59.444 --> 03:39:00.844]  I filmed myself.
[03:39:00.844 --> 03:39:08.966]  I was traveling by myself, so I didn't have anybody to film me, so you can see this, but you really need to hear what went on between us.
[03:39:08.966 --> 03:39:19.769]  To put this in context, we'll play that in just a second, but to put it in context, we went up and traveling with my daughter, they let my wife and daughter go through the scanner instead of having to pack down.
[03:39:20.445 --> 03:39:23.165]  And so we were talking to the fellow there about the adoption and that sort of thing.
[03:39:23.165 --> 03:39:26.646]  He'd adopted a child and so he said, just all of you go through, alright?
[03:39:26.646 --> 03:39:27.686]  Except for Travis.
[03:39:27.686 --> 03:39:29.006]  Travis was over to the side.
[03:39:29.006 --> 03:39:30.507]  He'd already opted out.
[03:39:30.507 --> 03:39:38.148]  So we had to wait a very long time for him and what was unusual about it was the guy who was the screener, when we finally got there, spent a very long time talking to Travis.
[03:39:38.148 --> 03:39:39.308]  And so we started filming.
[03:39:39.308 --> 03:39:40.568]  We don't always film.
[03:39:40.568 --> 03:39:41.149]  Yeah.
[03:39:41.149 --> 03:39:42.329]  But we started filming.
[03:39:42.329 --> 03:39:43.769]  That got them very upset.
[03:39:43.769 --> 03:39:48.870]  So the guy who let us through came up to me and started talking to me about filming and this is what he had to say.
[03:39:48.870 --> 03:39:49.490]  Alright, let's roll it.
[03:39:53.351 --> 03:39:56.320]  I think you guys are favored by what when you go through the door.
[03:39:56.320 --> 03:39:58.366]  Now you're doing this?
[03:39:58.366 --> 03:39:59.569]  I did this all the time, yes.
[03:40:00.726 --> 03:40:04.708]  We have to do it, because he obviously... Well, I have to do this to protect my rights.
[03:40:04.708 --> 03:40:07.149]  Yeah, but we're not offending him.
[03:40:07.149 --> 03:40:09.430]  I find this whole process offensive.
[03:40:09.430 --> 03:40:13.392]  Yes, I find it offensive in America to be considered a terrorist and have to prove my innocence.
[03:40:13.392 --> 03:40:15.173]  So, I'm going to keep doing this.
[03:40:15.173 --> 03:40:16.313]  I have a right to do this.
[03:40:16.313 --> 03:40:18.934]  If you look at the TSA, it says I have a right to do this.
[03:40:18.934 --> 03:40:24.437]  If he agrees, have his face up there, because we've been slandered a lot when we've done our job.
[03:40:24.437 --> 03:40:24.737]  You know what?
[03:40:25.057 --> 03:40:27.459]  There's nothing about him agreeing to doing his job.
[03:40:27.459 --> 03:40:30.000]  Police and TSA, we're allowed to film.
[03:40:30.000 --> 03:40:31.762]  It's our right to do that.
[03:40:31.762 --> 03:40:33.883]  You are servants of the people.
[03:40:33.883 --> 03:40:35.584]  You are not separate to the people.
[03:40:35.584 --> 03:40:36.825]  We have a right to film you.
[03:40:36.825 --> 03:40:38.246]  We will continue to film you.
[03:40:38.246 --> 03:40:39.887]  There are cameras everywhere.
[03:40:39.887 --> 03:40:40.247]  I know.
[03:40:40.247 --> 03:40:41.808]  Everybody's being... Yeah.
[03:40:41.808 --> 03:40:43.209]  So these are our cameras.
[03:40:43.209 --> 03:40:44.350]  These are the people's cameras.
[03:40:44.350 --> 03:40:45.150]  You got a problem with that?
[03:40:45.150 --> 03:40:46.231]  No, I'm not.
[03:40:46.231 --> 03:40:46.551]  Okay.
[03:40:46.551 --> 03:40:48.693]  I just told you I did you a favor.
[03:40:48.693 --> 03:40:49.293]  I understand.
[03:40:49.293 --> 03:40:51.014]  I understand you think you did us a favor.
[03:40:51.014 --> 03:40:51.675]  I appreciate it.
[03:40:51.675 --> 03:40:52.095]  Thank you.
[03:40:52.095 --> 03:40:53.056]  Thank you.
[03:40:54.457 --> 03:40:55.658]  So you see that long shot there?
[03:40:55.658 --> 03:41:02.881]  My other son, when he saw this developing, he went to the back, pulled out his camera and started filming me to see what was going on, because he thought something was going to develop there.
[03:41:02.881 --> 03:41:06.022]  But that was the thing about it, when I said, hey, you've got cameras all around here.
[03:41:06.022 --> 03:41:09.363]  The guy got this look on his face like, yeah, we got cameras everywhere.
[03:41:09.363 --> 03:41:10.764]  We got scanners, man.
[03:41:10.764 --> 03:41:12.685]  We got all these toys they let us play with.
[03:41:12.685 --> 03:41:14.065]  We get to look through your bags.
[03:41:14.065 --> 03:41:14.685]  It's great.
[03:41:14.685 --> 03:41:16.186]  Do you notice how insensitive he got?
[03:41:16.186 --> 03:41:16.486]  That's right.
[03:41:33.820 --> 03:41:41.322]  But when you look at this security theater, understand that what they're going to do at the border with the wall, they've already, that's security theater as well.
[03:41:41.322 --> 03:41:44.343]  It's not going to close the border, it's not going to help anything.
[03:41:44.343 --> 03:41:48.784]  This is being incentivized, the open immigration is being incentivized by Obama.
[03:41:48.784 --> 03:41:54.385]  He has given them all kinds of goodies, and when you make that kind of pot of gold available to them at the end of the rainbow,
[03:41:54.825 --> 03:41:56.226]  They will do anything to come in.
[03:41:56.226 --> 03:41:57.126]  And guess what?
[03:41:57.126 --> 03:42:00.748]  About 40% of them come in on airplanes, according to some statistics.
[03:42:00.748 --> 03:42:03.409]  We don't know because we don't know how many people are coming in.
[03:42:03.409 --> 03:42:04.810]  Some people have put that figure out.
[03:42:04.810 --> 03:42:08.191]  You can't verify that because we don't know who's coming into the country.
[03:42:08.191 --> 03:42:19.717]  But these efforts to try to stop this, to try to set up a police state at the border, are going to be just as ineffective, just as obtrusive as this ridiculous TSA theater that we have to go through.
[03:42:20.057 --> 03:42:32.690]  Hey, you know, I met, I went tubing over the weekend, the long weekend, and I met a guy, he was a Hispanic fellow, and his girlfriend, they were, we were all inflating our tubes, and we started talking about, a little bit about politics.
[03:42:32.690 --> 03:42:34.392]  He'd never heard of InfoWars.
[03:42:34.392 --> 03:42:35.973]  And he goes, so what do you think about Trump?
[03:42:35.973 --> 03:42:41.319]  I said, well, you know, I like some things Trump says and they need to be said, but I don't think, you know, building a wall is going to solve anything.
[03:42:41.679 --> 03:42:45.402]  I think, you know, you build a 10-foot wall, you get an 11-foot ladder, are you going to tunnel under it?
[03:42:45.402 --> 03:42:46.583]  There's ways to get around that.
[03:42:46.583 --> 03:42:49.525]  I think you have to get rid of the incentives for people to come here.
[03:42:49.525 --> 03:42:53.308]  And he goes, you know, I heard it's not even, it's not even mostly Mexicans.
[03:42:53.308 --> 03:42:56.310]  It's people from South America and people from China coming in.
[03:42:56.310 --> 03:42:56.831]  Yes.
[03:42:56.831 --> 03:42:59.853]  And he's right, you know, and he doesn't even listen to us.
[03:42:59.853 --> 03:43:04.116]  But the word is getting out there that it's not, it's not about Mexican people.
[03:43:04.116 --> 03:43:06.618]  It's about the whole world wanting to come here.
[03:43:06.618 --> 03:43:09.961]  And we have to do this legal and lawfully because we're not allowed to go anywhere else
[03:43:10.501 --> 03:43:10.661]  Yeah.
[03:43:26.280 --> 03:43:30.183]  There's now reports of people like five times being deported that are getting caught.
[03:43:30.183 --> 03:43:32.645]  I mean, it's getting ridiculous out there.
[03:43:32.645 --> 03:43:33.386]  Totally ridiculous.
[03:43:33.386 --> 03:43:36.108]  So now Trump, of course, he tried to walk it back today.
[03:43:36.108 --> 03:43:36.648]  Yeah.
[03:43:36.648 --> 03:43:41.952]  But he says we need to bring the refugees from Syria in because they're going through absolute hell.
[03:43:41.952 --> 03:43:43.173]  That's not the criteria.
[03:43:43.173 --> 03:43:45.035]  And he didn't he never addressed.
[03:43:45.655 --> 03:43:49.617]  What was the root cause of the Syrian war, of the Syrian refugees?
[03:43:49.617 --> 03:43:53.899]  About our support, our creation, our arming, our equipping of ISIS.
[03:43:53.899 --> 03:43:56.640]  How that began in Syria.
[03:43:56.640 --> 03:44:00.362]  Those were the surrogates of John McCain and Barack Obama.
[03:44:00.362 --> 03:44:02.002]  And of course he completely ignores that.
[03:44:02.002 --> 03:44:05.384]  He says, this wouldn't have happened if we'd gone in and attacked Syria.
[03:44:05.384 --> 03:44:07.585]  And it's like, we did go in and attack.
[03:44:07.825 --> 03:44:08.345]  Syria.
[03:44:08.345 --> 03:44:16.109]  We would have done it more, except we exposed that they were using false flag incidents to try the sarin gas, supposedly, that was released.
[03:44:16.109 --> 03:44:18.790]  They tried to use things like that to up the war.
[03:44:18.790 --> 03:44:20.211]  It would have been more refugees.
[03:44:20.211 --> 03:44:21.771]  It would have been more destruction.
[03:44:21.771 --> 03:44:23.412]  Well, Obama wanted to go in, too.
[03:44:23.412 --> 03:44:27.774]  Obama wanted to go in, and we had the military stand down and said, we're not going to be ISIS's air force.
[03:44:27.774 --> 03:44:29.235]  We're not going to do it.
[03:44:29.235 --> 03:44:33.096]  And so he's echoing the same things as Obama, which I think is just totally despicable.
[03:44:33.096 --> 03:44:36.418]  It underscores the fact that we don't really have a choice.
[03:44:37.458 --> 03:44:41.479]  All of these guys, they're not outsiders, they're not talking about anything different.
[03:44:41.479 --> 03:44:49.061]  Ben Carson, Donald Trump, they're not saying anything that the other guys haven't already said in terms of our foreign policy, in terms of civil liberties.
[03:44:49.061 --> 03:44:52.342]  Have you heard any of them talk about this security theater?
[03:44:52.342 --> 03:44:56.723]  Have you heard any of them propose anything that would give us our constitutional rights back?
[03:44:56.723 --> 03:45:02.225]  They ask these gotcha questions like it's a game show about the political parties of Israel.
[03:45:02.225 --> 03:45:02.985]  That doesn't matter!
[03:45:03.325 --> 03:45:07.507]  If they don't know or care about the Constitution, about our Bill of Rights, ask them about that.
[03:45:07.507 --> 03:45:11.809]  Ask them if they can recite one of the amendments in the Bill of Rights.
[03:45:11.809 --> 03:45:14.570]  The 7th Amendment.
[03:45:14.570 --> 03:45:15.630]  What do you think that means?
[03:45:15.630 --> 03:45:16.511]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:45:16.511 --> 03:45:18.071]  And that's the problem.
[03:45:18.071 --> 03:45:21.713]  It is the presidential reality show, as Gerald Solentek said and others.
[03:45:21.713 --> 03:45:26.215]  I know people are putting a lot of eggs behind Donald Trump and he's saying some things that need to be said.
[03:45:26.215 --> 03:45:31.197]  It's great that that stuff's getting out there in the public arena, but at the end of the day,
[03:45:31.877 --> 03:45:44.462]  When you're getting that high up, you know, if Trump was really gonna be an agent of change, of positive change, to get rid of what's going on with the Federal Reserve and all that, he would either be killed or he would be destroyed politically.
[03:45:44.462 --> 03:45:44.982]  That's right.
[03:45:44.982 --> 03:45:46.723]  Gorsuch's been funding it on the other end.
[03:45:46.723 --> 03:45:48.964]  He's been one of the people driving it, buying politicians.
[03:45:49.764 --> 03:45:52.105]  But I want to get back to this TSA thing for a moment.
[03:45:52.105 --> 03:45:55.485]  Because one of the things, I think, you notice that the guy walked away.
[03:45:55.485 --> 03:45:56.546]  I set up to him.
[03:45:56.546 --> 03:45:58.486]  I wasn't going to put that camera down.
[03:45:58.486 --> 03:46:01.907]  You cannot allow them to define what your country is.
[03:46:01.907 --> 03:46:04.608]  You cannot make them force you through the machines.
[03:46:04.608 --> 03:46:08.909]  If they force you through the machines, they're going to force you into the concentration camps.
[03:46:08.909 --> 03:46:11.169]  They're going to force you into the showers one day.
[03:46:11.169 --> 03:46:12.329]  You have to stand up.
[03:46:12.329 --> 03:46:13.990]  When we go through this, when we opt out,
[03:46:14.770 --> 03:46:16.391]  We're the only ones doing it anymore.
[03:46:16.391 --> 03:46:17.632]  I don't see anybody doing it.
[03:46:17.632 --> 03:46:20.253]  That's one of the reasons why this guy got so indignant about it.
[03:46:20.253 --> 03:46:20.513]  Yeah.
[03:46:20.513 --> 03:46:22.014]  Because we opted out in the first place.
[03:46:22.014 --> 03:46:23.014]  This is so unusual.
[03:46:23.014 --> 03:46:29.357]  They had to go get a supervisor to come do it because Americans have accepted this as reality that they live in.
[03:46:29.357 --> 03:46:32.199]  So when we go through this, we try to throw a monkey wrench in the system.
[03:46:32.199 --> 03:46:34.180]  I know that it's not much, but it's a monkey wrench.
[03:46:34.600 --> 03:46:39.163]  But we throw a little plastic hollow monkey wrench when one person does it or one family does it.
[03:46:39.163 --> 03:46:40.304]  It's easily crushed.
[03:46:40.304 --> 03:46:43.366]  If the masses would stand up and say, we're opting out.
[03:46:43.366 --> 03:46:45.488]  We've tried to do this with people with the opt-out.
[03:46:45.488 --> 03:46:46.789]  We've organized that twice.
[03:46:46.789 --> 03:46:48.250]  Let's everybody opt out on this one day.
[03:46:48.250 --> 03:46:50.151]  The first time they were very scared about it.
[03:46:50.151 --> 03:46:51.552]  They just completely opened up.
[03:46:51.832 --> 03:46:52.072]  Yeah.
[03:47:11.269 --> 03:47:23.514]  You got in his face, but you did it very politely, and you explained yourself, and what you did, it should be a model for people on how they should film the TSA and opt out.
[03:47:23.514 --> 03:47:27.295]  I mean, that's a model strategy that you used.
[03:47:27.455 --> 03:47:28.115]  Well, thanks.
[03:47:28.115 --> 03:47:29.576]  There was an article we had up yesterday.
[03:47:29.576 --> 03:47:37.597]  I didn't have a chance to look at it because we're traveling, but there was a pastor who stood up to an officer who was telling them that they had to go to the designated free speech area.
[03:47:37.597 --> 03:47:40.998]  You don't have designated free speech areas.
[03:47:40.998 --> 03:47:42.599]  The First Amendment is not an area.
[03:47:42.599 --> 03:47:44.119]  That was a sign that was up at the Bundy Ranch.
[03:47:44.119 --> 03:47:45.179]  That got a lot of people upset.
[03:47:45.179 --> 03:47:46.820]  But we get used to these things.
[03:47:46.820 --> 03:47:48.180]  At first, people push back against it.
[03:47:48.260 --> 03:47:48.840]  Right.
[03:47:48.840 --> 03:47:49.861]  Then they get used to it.
[03:47:49.861 --> 03:47:56.864]  And we've seen this free speech suppression going on at every one of the political conventions, Democrat and Republican, for the last several cycles.
[03:47:56.864 --> 03:48:01.406]  They take everybody who is there to protest and they stick them in a cage now.
[03:48:01.406 --> 03:48:01.786]  In a cage.
[03:48:01.786 --> 03:48:06.588]  Not just enough to remove them away from the front of the place where they could be seen.
[03:48:07.168 --> 03:48:08.869]  But to put them in a cage.
[03:48:08.869 --> 03:48:10.510]  That's what we've done to our rights.
[03:48:10.510 --> 03:48:11.551]  We've put them in a cage.
[03:48:11.551 --> 03:48:13.432]  We've turned everything upside down.
[03:48:13.432 --> 03:48:17.395]  The Constitution was meant to cage in the government, not the people.
[03:48:17.395 --> 03:48:21.798]  And now the people are using, if they're allowed to use their First Amendment, it's from a cage.
[03:48:21.798 --> 03:48:30.444]  And then we tell people that we have to go to war and fight these other people to preserve our rights and our freedom, when here at home we're systematically destroying what
[03:48:31.024 --> 03:48:34.025]  You know, it's really been a 200 plus year experiment.
[03:48:34.025 --> 03:48:34.685]  Yes.
[03:48:34.685 --> 03:48:36.606]  And it's really a shame.
[03:48:36.606 --> 03:48:37.786]  We got a few more minutes left.
[03:48:37.786 --> 03:48:39.006]  I want to get to this.
[03:48:39.006 --> 03:48:42.447]  Garbage trucks begin to recording license plates for law enforcement.
[03:48:42.447 --> 03:48:46.549]  So now the garbage man is going to be the new secret police.
[03:48:46.549 --> 03:48:47.809]  And I have a clip.
[03:48:47.809 --> 03:48:48.889]  This is from Activist Post.
[03:48:48.889 --> 03:48:56.212]  They had a clip in here from the local television station in Silicon Valley.
[03:48:56.212 --> 03:48:57.692]  And let's roll that first clip.
[03:48:58.865 --> 03:49:10.177]  There's a different way to fight crime in a city facing a shortage of police officers, but now San Jose is considering equipping garbage trucks with license plate readers as an extra set of eyes on the streets.
[03:49:10.177 --> 03:49:14.061]  Never thought of it that way, but you know, we live in a different world.
[03:49:14.474 --> 03:49:23.296]  Never in a million years did Steve Jones of Garden City Sanitation think his garbage trucks could be used for anything more than a pick-up trash, let alone a crime-fighting tool.
[03:49:23.296 --> 03:49:33.639]  I mean, that'd be a pretty good day if we ended up having to drive by a car that was used to abduct a child and that child got saved.
[03:49:33.639 --> 03:49:36.499]  Help with AMBER alerts and tracking stolen cars.
[03:49:36.499 --> 03:49:42.621]  Reasons the City of San Jose is exploring mounting license plate readers on garbage and recycling trucks.
[03:49:43.882 --> 03:49:44.462]  There you go.
[03:49:44.462 --> 03:49:47.283]  You know how much they're going to cost?
[03:49:47.283 --> 03:49:47.943]  $15,000 a piece.
[03:49:47.943 --> 03:49:50.584]  You think they're concerned about stolen vehicles, our lost children?
[03:49:50.584 --> 03:49:50.804]  No.
[03:49:50.804 --> 03:49:53.685]  No, it's going to be about serving warrants and giving people tickets.
[03:49:53.685 --> 03:49:54.065]  That's right.
[03:49:54.065 --> 03:49:56.866]  That's what it's going to be about, because they're going to go by and say, oh, you were parked illegally.
[03:49:56.866 --> 03:49:57.786]  Mostly tickets.
[03:49:57.786 --> 03:49:58.386]  Mostly tickets.
[03:49:58.386 --> 03:50:00.687]  That's what it's all going to be about.
[03:50:00.687 --> 03:50:02.147]  It has nothing to do with safety.
[03:50:02.147 --> 03:50:04.008]  It has nothing to do with finding stolen cars.
[03:50:04.008 --> 03:50:05.448]  They're not going to find one stolen car.
[03:50:05.928 --> 03:50:08.190]  But they always use it as safety.
[03:50:08.190 --> 03:50:12.333]  Again, when we're in the airport, every couple of minutes there's a loop from the TSA.
[03:50:12.333 --> 03:50:14.134]  Safety is our number one concern.
[03:50:14.134 --> 03:50:15.415]  It's not my number one concern.
[03:50:15.415 --> 03:50:23.440]  We've gone from a country where our founder said, give me liberty or give me death, to this country where it's like, safety, throw everything under the bus for safety.
[03:50:23.440 --> 03:50:24.381]  Literally under the bus.
[03:50:24.381 --> 03:50:25.262]  Safety first.
[03:50:25.262 --> 03:50:25.442]  Yeah.
[03:50:25.782 --> 03:50:26.542]  But you know what?
[03:50:26.542 --> 03:50:28.923]  When you do that, when you give up your liberty, what are you?
[03:50:28.923 --> 03:50:29.744]  You're a slave.
[03:50:29.744 --> 03:50:30.804]  You're a prisoner.
[03:50:30.804 --> 03:50:32.745]  Prisoners and slaves are never safe.
[03:50:32.745 --> 03:50:35.366]  And you deserve neither if you give up your liberty or security.
[03:50:35.366 --> 03:50:36.726]  You will get and deserve neither.
[03:50:36.726 --> 03:50:37.887]  Your liberty or security.
[03:50:37.887 --> 03:50:41.408]  Remember that out there when you are going through those TSA lines.
[03:50:41.408 --> 03:50:43.789]  If you're not opting out, you should be.
[03:50:43.789 --> 03:50:44.869]  And film it.
[03:50:44.869 --> 03:50:46.370]  Film the pat-down.
[03:50:46.370 --> 03:50:47.070]  They don't like it.
[03:50:47.070 --> 03:50:47.630]  That's fine.
[03:50:47.630 --> 03:50:48.871]  They got cameras everywhere.
[03:50:49.707 --> 03:50:51.688]  Alright, film your opt-outs.
[03:50:51.688 --> 03:50:53.168]  Put them up on YouTube.
[03:50:53.168 --> 03:50:54.209]  Get other people involved.
[03:50:54.209 --> 03:50:55.930]  Alright, we got one more segment left.
[03:50:55.930 --> 03:50:58.131]  It's the Overdrive Hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:50:58.131 --> 03:50:58.551]  Stay tuned.
[03:51:04.929 --> 03:51:07.011]  Hey neighbor, what are you doing digging?
[03:51:07.011 --> 03:51:08.713]  You had a heart attack last year.
[03:51:08.713 --> 03:51:10.194]  Oh, I know.
[03:51:10.194 --> 03:51:12.116]  I was told no more hard labor.
[03:51:12.116 --> 03:51:13.698]  Then why are you digging?
[03:51:13.698 --> 03:51:15.560]  Well, I've been taking extendovite.
[03:51:15.560 --> 03:51:17.302]  It's been approved to help my heart.
[03:51:17.302 --> 03:51:18.363]  Extendovite?
[03:51:18.363 --> 03:51:19.244]  Is that a new drug?
[03:51:20.086 --> 03:51:21.447]  No, not a drug.
[03:51:21.447 --> 03:51:25.268]  It's more like an herbal combination made from garlic and cayenne.
[03:51:25.268 --> 03:51:25.908]  Herbal?
[03:51:25.908 --> 03:51:27.409]  How can that help?
[03:51:27.409 --> 03:51:29.910]  Well, actually, we've taken herbs for thousands of years.
[03:51:29.910 --> 03:51:31.991]  Extendivite is doing the job for me.
[03:51:31.991 --> 03:51:34.592]  Does your doctor know about Extendivite?
[03:51:34.592 --> 03:51:38.193]  Yeah, my doctor knows, and he said it seems to be working for you, so don't stop taking it.
[03:51:38.473 --> 03:51:40.235]  I feel great taking Xtendivite.
[03:51:40.235 --> 03:51:41.396]  I don't want to stop.
[03:51:41.396 --> 03:51:42.637]  To order, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:42.637 --> 03:51:43.398]  That's 1-877-928-8822.

[03:51:54.376 --> 03:52:03.178]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[03:52:03.178 --> 03:52:16.541]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world so prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[03:52:16.681 --> 03:52:25.508]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[03:52:25.508 --> 03:52:27.369]  This is the good halogen.
[03:52:27.369 --> 03:52:30.432]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[03:52:30.432 --> 03:52:42.441]  Now we at InfoWarsLife.com are bringing you the only source of clean, pure, 99.99 Ultra Pure Deep Earth Crystals from more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.

[03:53:07.754 --> 03:53:11.718]  The more cable TV rates go up, the better digital satellite TV looks.
[03:53:11.718 --> 03:53:13.460]  Say goodbye to the cable guy.

[03:54:06.905 --> 03:54:21.454]  Well, I wanted to take calls this last segment, but Jakari Jackson ran in here and threw David Knight out.
[03:54:21.454 --> 03:54:23.995]  He's got some gun news we're gonna get to.
[03:54:23.995 --> 03:54:31.380]  So, uh, Eric, Wesley, Sherry, Joshua, and Donna, sorry, um, although, man, Donna's got a
[03:54:33.149 --> 03:54:39.710]  I wanted to warn parents about teachers and school officials who like to say that their children shouldn't be active or ask too many questions.
[03:54:39.710 --> 03:54:47.852]  That happened to my son when he was diagnosed with ADHD when he was in the 5th grade and 8 years ago he passed away at 19.
[03:55:04.236 --> 03:55:09.959]  Um, the ADHD drugs just really, uh, just really ruined him.
[03:55:09.959 --> 03:55:15.482]  And I grew up in that era with the propaganda, that whole just say no thing.
[03:55:15.482 --> 03:55:21.565]  And, uh, so, and he tried to tell me that marijuana made him feel better, but every time I caught him smoking, I threw him in rehab.
[03:55:21.565 --> 03:55:25.308]  And then every time I threw him in rehab, they put him on an antidepressant.
[03:55:25.308 --> 03:55:29.770]  So instead of the ADHD drugs, then we added the, that on top of it.
[03:55:29.770 --> 03:55:33.412]  And I don't want any parent to ever have to go through what I did or my husband did.
[03:55:34.164 --> 03:55:42.168]  When you have to bury a child, it changes you, and you're going to fight all you can for the children.
[03:55:42.168 --> 03:55:43.068]  Because it's speed.
[03:55:43.068 --> 03:55:44.709]  They're giving these kids speed.
[03:55:44.709 --> 03:55:46.650]  And I know the doctors know that.
[03:55:46.650 --> 03:55:48.471]  It's the right of the doctor's assistant.
[03:55:48.471 --> 03:55:49.712]  It just makes no sense.
[03:55:49.712 --> 03:55:53.413]  And so, that was my message, and you guys are doing a great job.
[03:55:53.413 --> 03:55:54.214]  I won't keep you.
[03:55:54.214 --> 03:55:57.175]  And I'm so sorry you had to go through that, David.
[03:55:59.375 --> 03:56:01.355]  And you're doing a great job.
[03:56:01.355 --> 03:56:02.876]  Love the 4th Hour.
[03:56:02.876 --> 03:56:03.896]  Well, I appreciate it.
[03:56:03.896 --> 03:56:05.356]  Tell your friends and family about it.
[03:56:05.356 --> 03:56:12.818]  I definitely want to take more calls to especially get stories like yours because we've got to warn people out there when they're pushing these drugs on us.
[03:56:12.818 --> 03:56:19.999]  We have to be able to stand up and have the information to know that you're not alone when you want to fight back and say no.
[03:56:19.999 --> 03:56:26.281]  Because there's other people out there that either didn't say no or they're learning from their mistakes or did say no in time.
[03:56:27.641 --> 03:56:29.122]  Uh, very sorry to hear that Donna.
[03:56:29.122 --> 03:56:29.742]  God bless you.
[03:56:29.742 --> 03:56:30.923]  Thank you for calling.
[03:56:30.923 --> 03:56:32.064]  You've got some gun news.
[03:56:32.064 --> 03:56:33.945]  It looks like, uh, what state is it?
[03:56:33.945 --> 03:56:37.146]  This is in Boston, so Massachusetts.
[03:56:37.146 --> 03:56:46.851]  They're running this program up there where they're mailing legal gun owners and asking them to turn in their weapons or, you know, come to the gun buyback and they'll give you a little $300 gift certificate.
[03:56:46.851 --> 03:56:47.712]  How do they know they have guns?
[03:56:47.952 --> 03:56:56.577]  Well, that's a very interesting question, Rob, because every time we talk to these people and say, we want more gun control, you guys are conspiracy theorists to say that there's some type of gun registry.
[03:56:56.577 --> 03:57:02.141]  Well, just like you mentioned, how do they know who has a gun if there is no such thing as a gun registry?
[03:57:02.141 --> 03:57:07.244]  I'll tell you, the ATF or the FBI, they always destroy this information X number of days after it's been completed.
[03:57:07.244 --> 03:57:10.966]  But somebody got a hold of this information, just like we saw in New York last year.
[03:57:10.966 --> 03:57:13.288]  It must have been going through Hillary's server.
[03:57:13.288 --> 03:57:14.248]  That's what it was.
[03:57:14.248 --> 03:57:16.730]  Just like we saw last year in New York.
[03:57:17.370 --> 03:57:24.580]  Project Veritas did a video about it, how they had the concealed carriers, all their information and database, and some newspaper published it.
[03:57:24.580 --> 03:57:29.367]  And then Project Veritas goes out to the houses like, hey, you want to put this gun-free zone sign in your front yard?
[03:57:29.367 --> 03:57:30.108]  No, I don't want to do that.
[03:57:30.108 --> 03:57:30.809]  Somebody's going to break in.
[03:57:31.636 --> 03:57:32.397]  You think?
[03:57:32.397 --> 03:57:33.337]  Wow.
[03:57:33.337 --> 03:57:34.999]  Surprise, surprise, surprise.
[03:57:34.999 --> 03:57:36.380]  It's basic common sense.
[03:57:36.380 --> 03:57:42.644]  But to say something real quick about the TSA, which you and David were talking about, I had an experience the last time I got on a plane.
[03:57:42.644 --> 03:57:45.186]  I think we went to Arkansas.
[03:57:45.186 --> 03:57:54.734]  I was going through to pat down, and the guy actually opened my bag, and the silliest thing I've ever seen the TSA do, they opened a can of Altoids, and were shaking the can of Altoids, trying to see what was inside.
[03:57:54.734 --> 03:57:56.495]  I was like, bro, it's Altoids.
[03:57:57.236 --> 03:58:02.305]  And they take stuff out of my bag and they're rubbing down my camera batteries with my wand and stuff.
[03:58:02.305 --> 03:58:04.649]  This is the most ridiculous stuff.
[03:58:04.649 --> 03:58:05.651]  What you got here, boy?
[03:58:06.383 --> 03:58:07.984]  Yeah, just feeling this.
[03:58:07.984 --> 03:58:13.048]  It's a ridiculous society we're living in now and we have to fight back or it's only going to get more ridiculous.
[03:58:13.048 --> 03:58:17.931]  They're going to start telling you what to say, how to say it, who to talk to, who not to talk to.
[03:58:17.931 --> 03:58:28.758]  We have to stand up and that's why we're here and that's why we're doing the fourth hour to get five hours of programming a day here at InfoWars.com, Central Texas Command Center.
[03:58:28.758 --> 03:58:30.159]  I'm Rob Due, that's Jakari Jackson.
