[00:00:06.308 --> 00:00:10.952]  There's a very interesting video that got posted by Washington and Lee University over the weekend.
[00:00:11.432 --> 00:00:20.039]  Michael Hayden, who has been at the top of the intelligence community as the surveillance state of the 21st century has been put into place.
[00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:26.024]  He was someone who began as the NSA Director around the time of 9-11, shortly prior to that.
[00:00:26.544 --> 00:00:30.247]  He then moved on to Director of National Intelligence, then on to the CIA.
[00:00:31.368 --> 00:00:39.453]  He's pretty unapologetic about how he's broken the law, and he made some amazing statements at this law symposium.
[00:00:39.793 --> 00:00:41.334]  I'm not a law enforcement officer.
[00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:43.155]  I don't suspect anybody.
[00:00:43.796 --> 00:00:44.736]  He's not law enforcement.
[00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:46.257]  He doesn't have any suspects.
[00:00:46.878 --> 00:00:50.800]  So I guess that would be why he doesn't go before a judge and get a search warrant.
[00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:59.326]  Now remember that in 2006, Michael Hayden told some reporters that the term probable cause is not in the Fourth Amendment.
[00:01:00.046 --> 00:01:02.247]  Well, it certainly is in the Fourth Amendment.
[00:01:02.587 --> 00:01:08.591]  Of course, it is a right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects.
[00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:10.812]  See, that's a right of the people.
[00:01:10.872 --> 00:01:14.494]  These are rights that we possess whether or not there's a Constitution or a Fourth Amendment.
[00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:26.141]  And the reason that we have the Fourth Amendment is because it puts prohibitions on people like Michael Hayden who think that they don't have or should not have any kind of controls on their actions.
[00:01:26.522 --> 00:01:33.166]  They should go before a judge and say that they have a reason to search for the person and they should be very specific about it.
[00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.488]  But he's turned this upside down.
[00:01:35.788 --> 00:01:43.473]  Instead of going to a judge and getting a search warrant saying, this is what I'm looking for, he does a dragnet surveillance of everyone about everything.
[00:01:43.753 --> 00:01:44.934]  Here's what else he had to say.
[00:01:45.094 --> 00:01:46.135]  This is not about guilt.
[00:01:46.515 --> 00:01:49.436]  In fact, let me be really clear.
[00:01:51.157 --> 00:01:54.259]  NSA doesn't just listen to bad people.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.241]  NSA listens to interesting people.
[00:02:03.413 --> 00:02:04.094]  Isn't that funny?
[00:02:04.654 --> 00:02:06.295]  He doesn't listen to bad people.
[00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:08.316]  He listens to interesting people.
[00:02:08.437 --> 00:02:08.837]  Ha ha.
[00:02:09.437 --> 00:02:10.498]  Who does he find interesting?
[00:02:10.898 --> 00:02:12.840]  Is it the political opponents of his boss?
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.422]  Is it somebody that would reign in the surveillance state?
[00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:18.824]  Maybe it's somebody that he'd like to blackmail.
[00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:25.248]  Maybe it's someone that would give him some information about insider trading on financial markets.
[00:02:25.308 --> 00:02:28.530]  Maybe it's corporate secrets from another country.
[00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:31.553]  Maybe he's just some kind of a perverted voyeur.
[00:02:32.293 --> 00:02:32.673]  Whatever.
[00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:35.234]  He doesn't believe that there's any restraints on him.
[00:02:35.474 --> 00:02:42.695]  And what you need to understand is that the lie that we're giving up our freedoms so they can protect us from the bad guys is just that.
[00:02:43.215 --> 00:02:43.736]  It's a lie.
[00:02:44.236 --> 00:02:45.496]  He doesn't care about bad people.
[00:02:45.796 --> 00:02:47.776]  He cares about interesting people.
[00:02:47.857 --> 00:02:49.097]  Maybe he'll take an interest in you.
[00:02:49.157 --> 00:02:51.257]  Let's listen to what he said about Section 215.
[00:02:51.997 --> 00:02:57.619]  A lot of commentary was made about Jim Clapper and the question from Juan Wyden on that.
[00:02:59.492 --> 00:03:05.093]  Yeah, he lied.
[00:03:06.073 --> 00:03:09.954]  Let's continue.
[00:03:11.334 --> 00:03:14.335]  He hosed it because he flat out lied under oath.
[00:03:14.395 --> 00:03:19.416]  But of course, if you're part of the intelligence community, you won't go to jail for lying under oath.
[00:03:19.436 --> 00:03:22.276]  Oh, it's the question that's the problem.
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.322]  I don't really know what a dossier is in this context.
[00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:45.769]  So what I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to the question, does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:47.550]  No, sir.
[00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.571]  It does not?
[00:03:51.512 --> 00:03:52.312]  Not wittingly.
[00:03:53.752 --> 00:04:00.295]  There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.
[00:04:00.975 --> 00:04:03.956]  Everyone on that dais knew the correct answer to that question.
[00:04:05.697 --> 00:04:11.040]  Everyone behind everyone on that dais, the staffers, knew the answer to that question.
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.141]  They all knew the 215 program.
[00:04:15.261 --> 00:04:20.764]  Ron Wyden was trying to trick Jim Clapper into making an admission of classified information
[00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:24.771]  That Ron Wyden didn't have the courage to make himself.
[00:04:25.392 --> 00:04:32.193]  Okay, so he says that all the senators, all their staffers knew that the 215 program was being abused.
[00:04:32.573 --> 00:04:33.293]  And I agree with him.
[00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:35.713]  Ron Wyden should have come out and said it.
[00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:42.995]  But I think it's a bit more interesting to hear the head of the NSA lie to Congress, lie to the American people.
[00:04:43.875 --> 00:04:46.295]  The whole program is a lie.
[00:04:46.355 --> 00:04:50.216]  The way that they're using the 215 section that they were given under the Patriot Act
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:05:00.228]  Even if that were constitutional, they're still exceeding their authority because that was supposed to be going after people that essentially you could get a search warrant for.
[00:05:00.308 --> 00:05:03.971]  Although you didn't have to go before a real judge, you just had to go before the FISA judge.
[00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:05.332]  But listen to what else he has to say.
[00:05:06.093 --> 00:05:09.356]  Why was Wyden trying to get Clapper to say what he was saying?
[00:05:10.717 --> 00:05:15.862]  Because Wyden, in the committee, was losing the vote on 215 consistently 15 to 2.
[00:05:18.973 --> 00:05:25.316]  So you put those two clips together and you understand that all the senators knew what was going on that were in the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[00:05:25.356 --> 00:05:32.740]  They knew that 215 was being abused, that they were going beyond their legal authority, which went beyond their constitutional authority.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.021]  Their staffers knew.
[00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:38.383]  And Ron Wyden could not get them to do the right thing.
[00:05:39.363 --> 00:05:44.946]  15 to 2, they were going to allow this continued abuse by the intelligence community.
[00:05:45.306 --> 00:05:46.047]  That's what he's saying.
[00:05:46.227 --> 00:05:49.108]  He's really making a case for how corrupt the Senate is.
[00:05:49.609 --> 00:05:50.589]  And it's gotten even worse.
[00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:52.150]  Ron Wyden is no longer there.
[00:05:52.630 --> 00:06:00.574]  And now we have Senator Burr from North Carolina who says he doesn't think there should be any public oversight of anything the intelligence community does.
[00:06:00.934 --> 00:06:02.275]  Listen to this last clip here.
[00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:04.837]  All your talk today about 215.
[00:06:04.877 --> 00:06:09.562]  215 is such a safe haven.
[00:06:09.582 --> 00:06:12.164]  215 is legislated by Congress.
[00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:18.110]  I was doing metadata collection under the President's raw Article 2 authorities from October 7th, 2001 forward.
[00:06:20.011 --> 00:06:20.471]  Catch that?
[00:06:21.031 --> 00:06:22.892]  Look at the smug expression on his face.
[00:06:22.932 --> 00:06:23.673]  He's so happy.
[00:06:23.953 --> 00:06:24.693]  He didn't need any 215.
[00:06:25.153 --> 00:06:27.734]  I don't need no stinking law.
[00:06:28.215 --> 00:06:29.495]  I'm a law unto myself.
[00:06:29.975 --> 00:06:31.696]  I take orders directly from the President.
[00:06:32.256 --> 00:06:34.938]  Or maybe he gives orders directly to the President.
[00:06:35.258 --> 00:06:35.718]  Who knows?
[00:06:36.258 --> 00:06:37.259]  They do whatever they wish.
[00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:38.079]  He doesn't need the 215.
[00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:40.920]  He doesn't need a law from Congress.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.441]  He doesn't need the Patriot Act.
[00:06:42.881 --> 00:06:45.122]  And he could care less about the Constitution.
[00:06:45.162 --> 00:06:46.403]  Listen to what else he has to say.
[00:06:47.283 --> 00:06:49.624]  The 215 program doesn't begin with the Patriot Act.
[00:06:51.194 --> 00:07:00.378]  Yeah, we decided what the law is.
[00:07:01.278 --> 00:07:02.119]  They did it in secret.
[00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:09.162]  And of course, you're not going to be allowed to know anything that he does because that would hurt his effectiveness.
[00:07:10.242 --> 00:07:13.824]  To look at people who are interesting, not people who are bad guys.
[00:07:13.904 --> 00:07:15.664]  Tell us what you think in the comments below.
[00:07:15.744 --> 00:07:17.365]  I think this is an outrage, personally.
[00:07:17.425 --> 00:07:19.606]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[00:07:27.062 --> 00:07:32.868]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:43.058]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:47.083]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
