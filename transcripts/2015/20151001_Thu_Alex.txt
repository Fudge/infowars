[00:00:15.373 --> 00:00:16.013]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.694 --> 00:00:17.715]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:19.556]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.216 --> 00:00:21.017]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.798 --> 00:00:22.678]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.981]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.542 --> 00:00:31.644]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.968 --> 00:00:43.413]  Well, it's already starting to get people's attention.
[00:00:44.562 --> 00:00:49.603]  But not as much attention as it should be garnering right now.
[00:00:50.964 --> 00:01:07.508]  And of course I'm talking about the clear makings of what could potentially become a giant conflagration in the Middle East spilling into Central Asia, Eastern Europe, Russia, Central and Western Europe.
[00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:12.869]  And then that could easily domino into what they call World War 4.
[00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:15.589]  At the Pentagon.
[00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:26.295]  Because World War 3 was the Cold War and the Middle Eastern Wars, the proxy wars of the last 50 years.
[00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:36.360]  World War 4 is through proxy terror groups, and is economic war, cyber war,
[00:01:37.776 --> 00:01:46.401]  Proxy war, but also expanding regional conflicts where actual armies of major world powers begin to go toe-to-toe.
[00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:49.383]  Because proxy armies can only go so far.
[00:01:51.264 --> 00:01:52.364]  I got up at about 6 a.m.
[00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:58.568]  this morning and continued to do deep research before coming into the office about 30 minutes ago.
[00:02:01.417 --> 00:02:12.085]  And I was sitting here as we began to go live two minutes ago, and I just do not even have words to describe how dangerous the situation is.
[00:02:14.186 --> 00:02:20.491]  But I'm going to do my best to really come back at the start of the next segment and lay out a presentation of exactly where we are.
[00:02:20.951 --> 00:02:28.417]  If you are a longtime listener, you know we've laid out precisely what was unfolding, what was going to unfold,
[00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:32.386]  And the different avenues we could be going down.
[00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:35.426]  But you need to understand, U.S.
[00:02:35.546 --> 00:02:47.650]  military and NATO military forces have been fighting Russians for at least four years in Syria and for about two years in Ukraine.
[00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.751]  And we have bizarro statements.
[00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:53.271]  In fact, I forgot to tell the crew to get these.
[00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:53.751]  You can get them.
[00:02:54.431 --> 00:02:54.892]  Take your time.
[00:02:54.932 --> 00:02:56.432]  Don't freak out because I'm springing this on you.
[00:02:58.381 --> 00:02:59.642]  The retired U.S.
[00:02:59.662 --> 00:03:04.924]  General, the Fox News pundit, saying we need to go ahead and start killing more Russians, lots of dead Russians is the answer.
[00:03:05.965 --> 00:03:10.827]  Then the head NATO General said, oh, we can defeat the Russians real quick and real easy.
[00:03:10.867 --> 00:03:12.768]  We're ready to crush them militarily.
[00:03:13.108 --> 00:03:14.168]  We're preparing to do so.
[00:03:14.468 --> 00:03:18.050]  I mean, just chilling, crazy town statements.
[00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.632]  Like you're a bully talking about, you know, you're 15, you're going to beat up a 10-year-old.
[00:03:24.056 --> 00:03:25.836]  Just shooting your mouth off, kind of.
[00:03:25.856 --> 00:03:30.097]  I mean, even if you had that power to do that, you wouldn't shoot your mouth off like that.
[00:03:30.137 --> 00:03:31.078]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:44.921]  Because now we have John McCain on Fox News yesterday saying now it's time to give service-to-air anti-aircraft missiles to the supposed rebels.
[00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:52.556]  There's the headline, Infowars.com, McCain arm Syrian rebels to shoot down Russian planes.
[00:03:53.477 --> 00:03:56.038]  Just like we did in Afghanistan.
[00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:05.763]  Well back then you could say the Soviet Union was evil and corrupt, but arming what became Al-Qaeda we can see was certainly a bad idea.
[00:04:06.263 --> 00:04:13.847]  Now McCain meets with actual Al-Qaeda that runs ISIS, and that's in the news, I'm going to cover that in a moment, huge news, they're now admitting it.
[00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:23.190]  And then now he says, give weapons to people that are sworn to shoot down Western commercial aircraft.
[00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:29.434]  So they've gone into Syria, they've started the war, they can't win the war.
[00:04:30.354 --> 00:04:35.258]  Chinese, Iranian, and Russian troops are landing daily, massing.
[00:04:35.918 --> 00:04:38.400]  Putin's preparing for all-out war in Europe.
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.761]  Just drafted 150,000 conscripts today
[00:04:44.403 --> 00:04:53.532]  Readying nuclear forces for nuclear war and you've got the average American talking about how proud they are of Caitlyn Jenner and how that's the new symbol of America.
[00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:56.916]  This is called the complete setup of this country.
[00:04:57.396 --> 00:05:07.126]  I'm gonna lay out exactly what we're facing straight ahead because there's a larger globalist operation behind this to bring down the United States and Russia when the globalists are done.
[00:05:09.244 --> 00:05:13.066]  Just when you think the government couldn't get any more ludicrous, the U.S.
[00:05:13.127 --> 00:05:20.831]  Environmental Protection Agency has taken to social media to point out the harmful effects of sunny days on plant life.
[00:05:21.032 --> 00:05:21.572]  That's right.
[00:05:21.752 --> 00:05:24.854]  The agency tweeted, Think sunny days are good for plants?
[00:05:25.174 --> 00:05:25.815]  Not always.
[00:05:26.095 --> 00:05:30.658]  Sunlight causes ozone to form, which harms foliage and weakens trees.
[00:05:31.098 --> 00:05:37.079]  Makes you wonder, how did the planet survive for millennia before a big bloated government came along to protect it?
[00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:48.402]  Let's just point out the absurdity of the EPA highlighting the alleged danger of sunlight as the world is facing numerous legitimate environmental issues, some of which have been caused by the agency itself.
[00:05:48.602 --> 00:05:58.064]  Let's not forget this is the same agency that polluted the Animas River with more than 3 million gallons of toxic waste last month, in an effort to cover up that disaster.
[00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:02.647]  EPA officials refuse to provide data to the press on the extent of the damage.
[00:06:02.968 --> 00:06:08.712]  Read the article, Obama's EPA warns sunlight dangerous to plants at InfoWars.com.

[00:08:20.703 --> 00:08:23.685]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:24.265 --> 00:08:28.467]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:48.497]  Well, it was former Brigadier General Robert H. Scales, the Fox News military analyst, that called for, quote, it's time to start killing Russians to save Ukraine and fill up a lot of body bags.
[00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:54.184]  And he's the same Pentagon General that's been proposing a limited nuclear war.
[00:08:54.945 --> 00:09:00.511]  And a lot of the other people at the Pentagon think we could have a nuclear war with Russia, but that might not be a bad idea.
[00:09:00.531 --> 00:09:02.534]  That's Fox News.
[00:09:03.134 --> 00:09:06.598]  I mention that because we have, of course, this new clip.
[00:09:07.856 --> 00:09:12.618]  of John McCain, he says, arm Syrian rebels to shoot down Russian planes.
[00:09:13.218 --> 00:09:15.199]  Yeah, you've already given them anti-tank missiles.
[00:09:15.659 --> 00:09:18.280]  You've already given them some surface-to-aircraft missiles.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.481]  You've already turned al-Nusra, that is al-Qaeda.
[00:09:22.822 --> 00:09:23.582]  That is al-Qaeda.
[00:09:25.145 --> 00:09:28.929]  You've already turned them loose to run around for five years murdering hundreds of thousands.
[00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:34.916]  And so now you have the Junior League to recruit young people around the world called ISIS.
[00:09:34.976 --> 00:09:42.464]  And I'm going to break down exactly who runs who in just a moment and why the Russians just blew up the al-Nusra command base.
[00:09:43.145 --> 00:09:45.607]  Because that's the quote moderate rebels.
[00:09:46.428 --> 00:09:50.029]  And that's who NATO and the Pentagon have people in there advising.
[00:09:50.409 --> 00:09:56.110]  I'll bet you my bottom dollar, Western advisors were killed in these Russian strikes.
[00:09:57.131 --> 00:10:06.293]  Because the White House, NATO, France especially, and then Saudi Arabia, number one, and Turkey are quarterbacking the entire attack.
[00:10:06.693 --> 00:10:10.874]  That's why the foreign ministry yesterday, you can pull this up,
[00:10:11.792 --> 00:10:20.195]  Went public warning the Russians that they would, quote, escalate military action if the Russians didn't pull out.
[00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:22.956]  And Saudi Arabia isn't playing games.
[00:10:23.156 --> 00:10:31.479]  They funded and they ran with Osama bin Laden as their top officer.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:38.582]  The clandestine attack with General Hamid Ghul, who's been on this show, doesn't go on any other Western shows.
[00:10:39.858 --> 00:10:43.980]  To defeat the Russians in the Afghan war in the 1980s.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:55.744]  And the Saudi Arabians that have the largest military arsenal in the Middle East, bigger than Israel's, conventionally, they have threatened to all-out attack Russia now.
[00:10:55.984 --> 00:11:00.826]  This has escalated to insane asylum levels.
[00:11:02.466 --> 00:11:03.947]  And so the Russians' response
[00:11:04.977 --> 00:11:12.008]  This morning was to launch eight airstrikes on the Al-Nusra command bases and totally destroying it.
[00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.073]  Al-Qaeda gives the orders.
[00:11:15.173 --> 00:11:16.315]  Al-Nusra is Al-Qaeda.
[00:11:17.036 --> 00:11:17.617]  That's on record.
[00:11:17.637 --> 00:11:18.999]  I'm going to read mainstream news saying that.
[00:11:20.128 --> 00:11:22.369]  They're like, why are the Russians blowing up Al-Qaeda?
[00:11:22.729 --> 00:11:24.929]  Well, our media says they don't have any power anymore.
[00:11:25.649 --> 00:11:27.590]  Al-Qaeda became IS.
[00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:28.890]  They fly the same flags.
[00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.170]  They're the same people.
[00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.491]  They are the Western intelligence intel base.
[00:11:34.011 --> 00:11:38.792]  So the Russians are trying to decapitate the command and control of ISIS in Syria.
[00:11:40.213 --> 00:11:41.013]  That's what you do.
[00:11:41.893 --> 00:11:45.134]  If you're actually trying to defeat an enemy, is you kill their leadership.
[00:11:45.494 --> 00:11:47.034]  You kill their military brass.
[00:11:47.315 --> 00:11:49.035]  You kill their commanders in the field.
[00:11:53.664 --> 00:11:56.966]  And you've got tens of thousands of Chinese pouring in.
[00:11:57.586 --> 00:11:59.187]  Ships are landing every day now.
[00:12:00.208 --> 00:12:07.892]  Tanks, anti-aircraft weapons, anti-tank weapons, it's all pouring in.
[00:12:08.849 --> 00:12:10.990]  Iranian troops are pouring in.
[00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.711]  Hezbollah is pouring in out of Lebanon.
[00:12:14.032 --> 00:12:16.032]  I mean, this is biblical, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:16.633 --> 00:12:30.920]  Vladimir Putin just conscripted 150,000 troops today to defend the Russian borders against Islamic attack because the globalists are activating terror squads in Chechnya and many other areas right now.
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:37.524]  Preparing them in the past, blowing up train stations, blowing up military bases, attacking police stations.
[00:12:37.985 --> 00:12:40.887]  I mean, the New World Order runs Al Qaeda.
[00:12:41.567 --> 00:12:43.308]  Saudi Arabia is in the middle of it.
[00:12:43.328 --> 00:12:45.010]  They've been promised the entire Middle East.
[00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:47.732]  It is unprecedented.
[00:12:48.913 --> 00:12:55.998]  Headline, London Telegraph, Russia kills U.S.-backed Syrian rebels in second day of airstrikes as Iran prepares a ground offensive.
[00:12:56.738 --> 00:12:57.499]  Live updates.
[00:12:58.079 --> 00:13:00.021]  And we'll roll some more of that
[00:13:01.101 --> 00:13:04.962]  Bomb pod footage for folks here in just a moment.
[00:13:05.002 --> 00:13:08.723]  We are simulcasting television right now and Russia doesn't have a choice.
[00:13:09.283 --> 00:13:10.123]  Is Russia perfect?
[00:13:10.184 --> 00:13:10.384]  No.
[00:13:10.804 --> 00:13:12.344]  But did Russia start this war?
[00:13:12.564 --> 00:13:13.905]  Did Russia start the Ukraine war?
[00:13:14.105 --> 00:13:15.425]  Did Russia start the Syria war?
[00:13:15.645 --> 00:13:16.845]  Did Russia start the Libya war?
[00:13:17.045 --> 00:13:18.386]  Did Russia start the Iraq war?
[00:13:19.486 --> 00:13:21.107]  Did Russia fund Al Qaeda?
[00:13:22.687 --> 00:13:26.188]  You understand that the two Boston bombing brothers, on record,
[00:13:27.366 --> 00:13:34.369]  Had their cover blown by the Russians two years before the Boston bombing as CIA double agents flying under fake passports under the State Department.
[00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.751]  You understand they're out of Georgetown University.
[00:13:39.291 --> 00:13:40.652]  You understand they were going to Chechnya.
[00:13:43.033 --> 00:13:44.614]  I don't know what happened with the Boston bombing.
[00:13:45.014 --> 00:13:47.135]  I just know, figure that one out.
[00:13:50.745 --> 00:13:54.049]  That's why the FBI got caught lying saying we've never heard of these guys before.
[00:13:54.189 --> 00:14:09.948]  I mean, this is an insane time to be alive when the supposed people that carried out 9-11, the Saudi Arabian government, has threatened Russia publicly to launch terror attacks inside Russia if they don't back out of the Middle East.
[00:14:10.905 --> 00:14:29.024]  And then meanwhile, Russia did kind of pull out of the Middle East a few years ago, and then the West's response was to start overthrowing areas of Ukraine on their border, traditionally part of Russia, and to start trying to overthrow Russia itself with color revolutions, and Russia said, okay, we have no choice, circle the wagons, get ready for war.
[00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:33.746]  Just like with Napoleon, just like with Hitler, history now repeats itself yet again.
[00:14:33.986 --> 00:14:41.249]  But this isn't Communist Russia now, hamstrung and totally controlled by Western-backed rebels that took over Russia in 1917.
[00:14:43.129 --> 00:14:51.172]  You know, our government with the British put the horrible scum in, in 1917.
[00:14:55.401 --> 00:14:57.443]  That was all basically New York, London run.
[00:14:57.804 --> 00:15:02.249]  But before I digress, this is just an incredible time to be alive right now.
[00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.632]  Russia moves to war footing.
[00:15:05.853 --> 00:15:11.941]  Putin signs a decree drafting 150,000 conscripts into the military as his jets launch a new wave of airstrikes.
[00:15:15.469 --> 00:15:19.212]  Here are some of the other headlines up on InfoWars.com.
[00:15:20.053 --> 00:15:26.759]  Iran, Hezbollah, Syrian Army prepare to launch offensive against CIA proxies on the ground.
[00:15:27.439 --> 00:15:29.361]  And the air offensive has already been launched.
[00:15:31.342 --> 00:15:35.166]  They run the headline that the USA is in disarray, Iran troops ready.
[00:15:36.271 --> 00:15:37.671]  Well, there's no disarray about it.
[00:15:37.811 --> 00:15:47.955]  They bet on the Sunni majority, that's 79% of Muslims, that Saudi Arabia is basically dominating and controlling and bullying with Wahhabist ideology.
[00:15:48.215 --> 00:15:51.096]  I'm not saying Sunnis are bad people or Shiites are bad people.
[00:15:51.556 --> 00:15:54.036]  They kill each other constantly for over a thousand years.
[00:15:56.037 --> 00:16:02.259]  The problem here and the ongoing crisis here
[00:16:04.392 --> 00:16:09.136]  is that this is no longer just a proxy war.
[00:16:09.236 --> 00:16:23.369]  This is becoming a major war with the Chinese, the Russians, the Iranians, the Syrians, lined up against NATO, Europe, the United States, Turkey,
[00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.936]  Saudi Arabia, Israel is backing the Syrian rebels.
[00:16:29.376 --> 00:16:36.827]  Israel came out, Netanyahu yesterday, and said they're going to begin airstrikes in areas of Syria against the Assad forces.
[00:16:37.689 --> 00:16:40.493]  Israel is announcing that they will
[00:16:41.594 --> 00:16:52.058]  Fly into airspace with Russian aircraft, and we'll start targeting the Assad forces, who for five years have been toe-to-toe against the Saudi Arabian Turkish proxy army, funded with U.S.
[00:16:52.098 --> 00:16:54.799]  weapons, and they killed the people of Benghazi to give them the weapons.
[00:16:55.439 --> 00:16:56.640]  You talk about dirty and evil.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.901]  And a lot of folks don't know what to do, have been pro-Israel, because I'm not anti-Israel.
[00:17:02.382 --> 00:17:08.184]  But, Israel, you can say, either is involved or quarterbacking it, or is following orders, I don't know.
[00:17:08.744 --> 00:17:10.345]  I know this, they're involved in it.
[00:17:11.328 --> 00:17:16.011]  Following Russian airstrikes, Israeli Defense Minister says Israel will defend its interest in Syria.
[00:17:16.592 --> 00:17:20.955]  And then again, they go on to announce they're going to start airstrikes against Assad forces.
[00:17:22.156 --> 00:17:23.116]  Assad's done nothing.
[00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:29.861]  Under international law, their government was democratizing, they were infiltrated, they were attacked by al-Qaeda forces.
[00:17:30.161 --> 00:17:31.602]  That is who al-Nusra is.
[00:17:32.223 --> 00:17:34.965]  And I'm going to skip this network break, this is so important, but only this one today.
[00:17:36.854 --> 00:17:38.235]  Here is the news from Reuters.
[00:17:38.915 --> 00:17:41.456]  Now, they spin this, but in the article is the truth.
[00:17:42.056 --> 00:17:49.300]  Russian warplanes, this is the key, Russian warplanes target insurgents in Syria, but not Islamic State.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:58.784]  Well, they're not going to target a bunch of grunts from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United States, Australia, Germany, France, the UK.
[00:17:58.804 --> 00:18:03.907]  They're not going to target the grunts on the ground first.
[00:18:04.507 --> 00:18:06.108]  They're going to target who runs them.
[00:18:08.271 --> 00:18:12.413]  The pro-Damascus television channel said jets carried out at least 30 strikes.
[00:18:13.114 --> 00:18:15.475]  They hit eight different areas, but 30 strikes in one spot.
[00:18:16.235 --> 00:18:30.183]  As insurgent alliance known as the Army of Conquest, the alliance includes the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda Syrian branch, but not Islamic State, which has declared a caliphate on swathes of Syria and Iraq.
[00:18:31.318 --> 00:18:38.701]  IS is the payoff to Saudi Arabia for the new Islamic State to launch new attacks worldwide in between Iraq and Syria.
[00:18:39.021 --> 00:18:41.782]  So that's the new breakup of Syria and Iraq.
[00:18:42.362 --> 00:18:48.604]  And then they just put a bunch of young, dumb idiots in there who will be removed later with whatever the West puts in and whatever Saudi Arabia puts in.
[00:18:49.285 --> 00:18:58.588]  So that's just the proxy army of wannabe cowboy, playboy, you know, rape king, scum, filth, trash that the West has produced and Saudi Arabia has produced.
[00:18:59.946 --> 00:19:07.411]  The real rebels trying to overthrow Assad are Al-Qaeda, that's Reuters, and the Russians just blew them up.
[00:19:10.033 --> 00:19:24.462]  Now, Russia's bombing, who supposedly blew up our towers on 9-11 and killed all of our Americans and we had to give up all our rights because of it, and Russia is being attacked all over its southern belly by these very same people that our U.S.
[00:19:24.502 --> 00:19:25.283]  government trained on record.
[00:19:26.678 --> 00:19:28.999]  Our own military knows this and is speaking out and saying no.
[00:19:29.259 --> 00:19:32.121]  The former head of Defense Intelligence went public two months ago, as you know.
[00:19:32.361 --> 00:19:34.182]  We played the clip probably 15 times.
[00:19:35.863 --> 00:19:39.585]  And the response of John McCain... We're gonna play it right now.
[00:19:41.666 --> 00:19:43.247]  The response of John McCain...
[00:19:46.176 --> 00:19:48.919]  Let's give them surface-to-air missiles, which he knows they've already got.
[00:19:49.159 --> 00:19:52.022]  They've already shot down a bunch of Syrian aircraft.
[00:19:52.402 --> 00:19:58.488]  The Russians just have better systems to avoid them, different countermeasures, and have better training.
[00:19:58.548 --> 00:20:08.317]  And so I still think you'll probably see Russian aircraft shot down because they're going up against the best weapons Saudi Arabia, Europe, and the United States taxpayers have to offer.
[00:20:09.651 --> 00:20:19.678]  Senator, but if they are attacking the very guys who we want to see topple Assad, you would let American planes just pass them and let them do that?
[00:20:20.419 --> 00:20:26.463]  No, but I might do what we did in Afghanistan many years ago to give those guys the ability to shoot down those planes.
[00:20:26.904 --> 00:20:28.965]  That equipment is available.
[00:20:30.326 --> 00:20:31.367]  Who would be shooting them down?
[00:20:32.205 --> 00:20:33.127]  The Free Syrian Army.
[00:20:33.387 --> 00:20:34.068]  The Free Syrian Army, not us.
[00:20:34.088 --> 00:20:42.021]  Just like the Afghans shot down the Russian, no, just like the Afghans shot down Russian planes after Russia invaded Afghanistan.
[00:20:42.061 --> 00:20:43.623]  I want to start at the beginning.
[00:20:45.446 --> 00:20:45.726]  Because...
[00:20:48.004 --> 00:20:48.744]  It's important.
[00:20:49.325 --> 00:20:51.086]  Let's play this clip without me interrupting it.
[00:20:51.106 --> 00:20:52.046]  Here it is.
[00:20:52.066 --> 00:21:02.112]  Senator, but if they are attacking the very guys who we want to see topple Assad, you would let American planes just pass them and let them do that?
[00:21:02.833 --> 00:21:08.876]  No, but I might do what we did in Afghanistan many years ago to give those guys the ability to shoot down those planes.
[00:21:09.316 --> 00:21:11.378]  That equipment is available.
[00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:13.779]  Who would be shooting them down?
[00:21:14.614 --> 00:21:15.555]  The Free Syrian Army.
[00:21:15.975 --> 00:21:23.783]  Just like the Afghans shot down the Russian... No, just like the Afghans shot down Russian planes after Russia invaded Afghanistan.
[00:21:23.803 --> 00:21:24.424]  But you hear what I'm saying?
[00:21:24.444 --> 00:21:32.192]  I mean, you can see how easily, as you pointed out to me in prior visits, how easily something like this escalates into something much, much worse.
[00:21:32.332 --> 00:21:33.133]  Are we at that stage?
[00:21:33.613 --> 00:21:41.036]  Oh, I think it would be much, much worse, but this administration, this president, this secretary of state, they aren't going to do anything that would escalate it.
[00:21:41.336 --> 00:21:47.938]  They're going to give them a free hand, just like they have given them a free hand throughout, just like we have no strategy whatsoever.
[00:21:48.018 --> 00:21:52.160]  So while we watch innocent men, women, and children... We have no strategy.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.341]  The neocons especially run Obama.
[00:21:55.486 --> 00:22:04.776]  They're doing exactly what McCain wanted to do, but he's giving Obama right cover from the fake right attacking him saying he has no strategy.
[00:22:05.477 --> 00:22:06.278]  No strategy?
[00:22:06.438 --> 00:22:14.106]  They have brought the weapons of Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the EU and its NATO army, the UN army.
[00:22:14.727 --> 00:22:15.628]  That's what NATO is.
[00:22:16.008 --> 00:22:27.855]  And the United States military weapons supplies, for five years, bullying the daylights out of the Syrians and killing over 300,000 of them, almost all of them civilians.
[00:22:30.056 --> 00:22:37.441]  Christians, Protestant and Catholic, non-radical, Alawite, peaceful Muslims and others.
[00:22:38.479 --> 00:22:53.044]  And that's why they're getting rid of one of the oldest Jewish communities, one of the oldest Christian communities, and one of the oldest Muslim communities in the world is Syria, where people have lived in peace for thousands of years because it's a tolerant government.
[00:22:54.725 --> 00:22:59.266]  Their leaders wear suits and ties, folks, and that's why they're being removed from power.
[00:22:59.566 --> 00:23:01.207]  Women don't wear hoods over their heads.
[00:23:04.554 --> 00:23:07.274]  Women are free over there, just like they were in Iraq.
[00:23:07.555 --> 00:23:08.655]  Are they free now in Iraq?
[00:23:08.995 --> 00:23:09.635]  No, they're not.
[00:23:11.335 --> 00:23:14.436]  The West wants Stone Age barbarism over there.
[00:23:14.716 --> 00:23:19.137]  The globalists want Agenda 21, deindustrialization worldwide.
[00:23:20.037 --> 00:23:32.439]  They do their own soft kill policies here to shut off our industries, break down our families, poison us, and then when they're able to really have their way with the country, they'll dismantle and blow up the entire infrastructure like Libya.
[00:23:34.261 --> 00:23:46.224]  We told you they'd de-industrialize and bring that country to the ground and raise every piece of equipment they had in a scorched earth policy, and they did exactly that because we know their operations.
[00:23:46.264 --> 00:23:47.284]  And I want to explain something.
[00:23:47.704 --> 00:23:56.286]  The Soviet Union, I've studied it, was incredibly oppressive, total political correctness, an absolute nightmare that Alexander Shultz and Nixon exposed.
[00:23:56.866 --> 00:23:58.348]  But by the time he left the U.S.
[00:23:58.388 --> 00:24:12.261]  in the early 90s and went back to Russia, the Pulitzer Prize winner, he said, America is going to become even more evil, and Russia's got to get nationalistic right now, because the plan is to basically bring in corporate communism worldwide, where they're exempt.
[00:24:12.481 --> 00:24:15.084]  Go read the last four or five books Solzhenitsyn wrote.
[00:24:15.264 --> 00:24:16.605]  Sounds like I wrote them.
[00:24:18.367 --> 00:24:19.948]  And when I was sitting there reading those books,
[00:24:21.072 --> 00:24:22.194]  It wasn't like I wrote them.
[00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:24.078]  We just both knew the truth.
[00:24:24.398 --> 00:24:25.220]  The truth is the truth.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.586]  Even if you've never heard somebody else say it, you already know it if you've studied it.
[00:24:32.574 --> 00:24:39.037]  And so, as bad as the Soviet Union was, there were attacks launched in Russia by forces out of Afghanistan.
[00:24:39.077 --> 00:24:42.678]  This was all declassified by Zbigniew Brzezinski in 1979.
[00:24:42.798 --> 00:24:43.918]  Reagan didn't launch that.
[00:24:43.998 --> 00:24:45.019]  Reagan didn't run that.
[00:24:45.319 --> 00:24:46.399]  He just got the credit for it.
[00:24:46.419 --> 00:24:48.440]  And I'm not defending or attacking Reagan.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.681]  Reagan didn't run the Afghan operations.
[00:24:51.962 --> 00:24:52.982]  Reagan didn't start it.
[00:24:53.262 --> 00:24:54.503]  Zbigniew Brzezinski did.
[00:24:54.563 --> 00:24:55.543]  It's declassified.
[00:24:55.803 --> 00:24:58.204]  They attacked the Russians in 78 and 79 with hundreds of attacks.
[00:25:00.805 --> 00:25:08.254]  And then the Russians came in at the behest of the Afghan government and they called it an invasion to take out the terrorists that were attacking Russia.
[00:25:10.116 --> 00:25:13.940]  And to get control of the opium because the Soviets were running smack into the U.S.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.062]  and the CIA didn't like it, they wanted the profits.
[00:25:16.403 --> 00:25:18.065]  So just two different criminal predator groups.
[00:25:21.633 --> 00:25:24.055]  And we'll get Joel Skousen's perspective on all this coming up.
[00:25:24.075 --> 00:25:28.438]  He may differ a bit, but this is historically what we know went on.
[00:25:28.898 --> 00:25:34.201]  And that was an evil war, that was wrong, and then look what we got out of it 9-11.
[00:25:35.002 --> 00:25:48.531]  And now though, talk about hindsight being 20-20, the children of Al-Qaeda, some of them the original leaders of Al-Qaeda from Afghanistan, the Saudi Arabian command group that ran that war,
[00:25:51.061 --> 00:25:52.942]  In Afghanistan and in Pakistan.
[00:25:57.246 --> 00:26:00.268]  Because believe me, there was a proxy war there as well, not just Afghanistan.
[00:26:01.489 --> 00:26:16.920]  We are now watching our government nakedly sit there and endorse airstrikes against the military of Syria that's now been given Russian air cover.
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.962]  So we're gonna have U.S.
[00:26:20.103 --> 00:26:23.126]  NATO, it's all moving into place.
[00:26:23.726 --> 00:26:29.371]  Israeli forces on the ground who are already there and then in the air.
[00:26:35.957 --> 00:26:44.244]  This confrontation is accelerating extremely quickly and is incredibly destabilizing to the whole world and is incredibly immoral.
[00:26:45.685 --> 00:26:47.727]  That John McCain would meet
[00:26:52.096 --> 00:26:56.880]  With al-Nusra, that he calls the Free Syrian Army, that he would give them the weapons.
[00:26:57.361 --> 00:27:04.487]  There's photographs of him with the leaders of al-Nusra and the leader that became the number two over ISIS.
[00:27:04.907 --> 00:27:06.228]  This is incredible.
[00:27:06.769 --> 00:27:10.092]  And so you've got all these different factions run by Saudi Arabia.
[00:27:12.714 --> 00:27:19.080]  IS, Islamic State, is creating a breakup of Syria and Iraq, and out of the breakup creating a new country between the two.
[00:27:20.899 --> 00:27:24.349]  But separately, you've got al-Nusra that will be the group.
[00:27:26.698 --> 00:27:35.305]  With a committee of conquest that is to take over the central government of what's left of Syria and the coastline and the oil and the gas.
[00:27:36.246 --> 00:27:39.728]  So there it all is, explained in living color.
[00:27:40.349 --> 00:27:51.998]  If you're former military, current military, former State Department, or if you're in the Middle East, if you've got some gravitas to add to this, if you disagree with me on some point, if you agree, if you'd like to
[00:27:53.579 --> 00:27:56.821]  Augment what I've said concerning how dangerous this is.
[00:27:58.101 --> 00:27:59.602]  Or perhaps you don't think it's a problem.
[00:28:00.162 --> 00:28:01.303]  We don't screen your calls.
[00:28:01.343 --> 00:28:03.004]  We love to hear what you have to say.
[00:28:03.024 --> 00:28:03.064]  800-259-9231.
[00:28:03.084 --> 00:28:03.124]  800-259-9231.
[00:28:03.164 --> 00:28:04.965]  Now this next clip is from a year ago.
[00:28:05.025 --> 00:28:06.826]  Putin at a world conference.
[00:28:18.946 --> 00:28:23.737]  And this is where Putin is talking about how our government, the U.S.
[00:28:23.757 --> 00:28:27.024]  government, created Islamic State.
[00:28:29.426 --> 00:28:40.011]  And more and more we're going to be going through with actual Russian speakers and listening to what Putin says and creating our own translations because the ones you're seeing on our news are not what Putin is saying.
[00:28:40.572 --> 00:28:48.436]  Putin is coming right out of the UN Monday and right out of the other events in the last few years saying it's a proxy war to destabilize things.
[00:28:48.996 --> 00:28:55.758]  That our government's putting Al-Qaeda in charge to take over that area of the world and then to threaten Russia, and you'll never hear it on the news.
[00:28:56.078 --> 00:29:01.620]  And then the media spins it like Putin is embarrassing America and Putin's our enemy and all the rest of it.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.701]  The truth is, even if Putin was a horrible guy, he's not on the offense.
[00:29:06.181 --> 00:29:12.784]  Our government's starting the fight and putting people who are horrible in charge, so we're losing the moral high ground because of it.
[00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:13.784]  Here is Putin.
[00:29:14.524 --> 00:29:19.270]  Another threat that President Obama mentioned was ISIS.
[00:29:23.146 --> 00:29:24.946]  Well, who on earth armed them?
[00:29:25.547 --> 00:29:30.629]  Who helped to arm the Syrians that were fighting against Assad?
[00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:36.111]  Who created the necessary political climate that facilitated the situation?
[00:29:37.092 --> 00:29:39.773]  Who pushed for the delivery of arms to the area?
[00:29:39.913 --> 00:29:44.175]  Do you really not understand as to who is fighting in Syria?
[00:29:44.195 --> 00:29:46.716]  Alright, we'll be back!
[00:29:47.517 --> 00:29:56.243]  We're gonna be taking your calls on this incredibly important subject that we are now not just in a proxy war with Russia and China and Iran, we're now in a war with them.
[00:29:58.664 --> 00:30:01.666]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.587 --> 00:30:05.269]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.966 --> 00:30:12.408]  Have you waited your whole life to become a mother?
[00:30:12.709 --> 00:30:15.832]  Well, you're probably a racist, sexist, homophobe.
[00:30:16.172 --> 00:30:30.086]  LGBT activists have already convinced the Midwives Alliance of North America to stop referring to their clients as women and mothers, and instead call them pregnant people and birthing individuals, so transsexuals won't get offended.
[00:30:30.766 --> 00:30:35.410]  Numerous midwives have protested this language change, calling it an attack on women.
[00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:50.123]  In an open letter, they say, by embracing the idea that any human, other than those in a class called women, can carry offspring to term, give birth to them, and nurse them, we are prioritizing gender identity over biological reality.
[00:30:50.763 --> 00:30:56.272]  Obviously this ideology contributes to the cultural erasure of women's unique power to give birth.
[00:30:56.713 --> 00:30:58.936]  It is encoded in our female bodies.
[00:30:59.216 --> 00:31:02.962]  That's what creates, nourishes, and births live offspring.

[00:33:18.169 --> 00:33:19.130]  You want answers?
[00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:22.252]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:22.373 --> 00:33:26.376]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.516 --> 00:33:32.801]  Alright, I want to move quick through the news now.
[00:33:32.921 --> 00:33:43.110]  I basically bemoan the fact that as a culture, as a country, we really do have madmen running things who are trying to start a war with China and Russia.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:53.187]  And they know that the people during a crisis like this will go into primitive mode and will start defending whatever the government does once a wider war starts.
[00:33:54.028 --> 00:33:55.209]  My country, right or wrong?
[00:33:56.169 --> 00:34:09.120]  The problem is America has officially, according to the Davos Switzerland meetings and other globalist announcements, been, quote, integrated into the New World Order private corporate global government.
[00:34:10.921 --> 00:34:13.964]  Now, integrated into that means conquered, means taken over.
[00:34:14.926 --> 00:34:15.706]  Means assimilated.
[00:34:17.327 --> 00:34:22.909]  And so for all intents and purposes, they have conquered the United States of America through subterfuge and infiltration.
[00:34:24.009 --> 00:34:26.550]  And these corporate interests are not going to be fighting and dying.
[00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.871]  They're not going to be paying for the war.
[00:34:28.411 --> 00:34:29.131]  You and I are.
[00:34:30.792 --> 00:34:40.776]  And they intend to either financially break Russia or have enough proxy wars with Russia that Russia finally makes a miscalculation and they can sell a wider war.
[00:34:41.544 --> 00:34:48.429]  That's what the whole COG and Homeland Security and all of it is about, hardening the government to survive a nuclear war.
[00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:53.613]  This is the madness that we had several times under L.L.
[00:34:53.653 --> 00:34:57.736]  Lemnitzer and other chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Cold War.
[00:34:58.396 --> 00:35:02.619]  John F. Kennedy shut down those plans, not once, but twice himself.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:08.904]  Eisenhower shut down a plan at least twice to launch preemptive nuclear war against Russia and China.
[00:35:12.458 --> 00:35:20.062]  And so we have a global elite who want to bring down the nation states and bring in a one world government, but they need a global crisis to sell it.
[00:35:20.903 --> 00:35:26.025]  So America and Russia is under globalist attack, just like Syria is under globalist attack.
[00:35:26.346 --> 00:35:37.532]  We all have solidarity in that we're under the technocratic manipulation, the divide and conquer, the grand chess board that Brzezinski wrote about in his book a decade ago, admitting all of this.
[00:35:38.936 --> 00:35:52.264]  And that out of destabilizing Russia and funding radical Islamic jihadists to destabilize the Middle East, they could bring in a global crisis to establish the collapse of the nation-state and the rise of world government.
[00:35:52.884 --> 00:35:53.524]  Go read his book.
[00:35:53.584 --> 00:35:56.666]  I've read the quotes here on air probably a hundred times.
[00:35:57.146 --> 00:36:01.289]  He thinks you're so stupid, he writes policy books admitting all of this.
[00:36:01.649 --> 00:36:04.751]  He wrote a book admitting he helped set up the Khmer Rouge.
[00:36:05.998 --> 00:36:09.459]  That killed 35% of Cambodia for no reason.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:10.900]  Whole families.
[00:36:14.801 --> 00:36:18.503]  So we're not, we're not messing with people who aren't dangerous.
[00:36:20.103 --> 00:36:21.044]  The globalists are smart.
[00:36:21.084 --> 00:36:22.644]  They have a lot of super secret weapons.
[00:36:23.785 --> 00:36:25.145]  They have a lot of super weapons.
[00:36:26.446 --> 00:36:28.406]  They have infiltrators all over the place.
[00:36:28.486 --> 00:36:32.928]  They have the dollar still, so they can buy off anybody they want as the world reserve currency.
[00:36:33.168 --> 00:36:35.209]  This is a very, very dangerous time to be alive.
[00:36:36.721 --> 00:36:59.637]  The people running our government are so wicked and so Machiavellian and so evil, they would fund actual Al Qaeda to go into five different countries and murder every Christian they get their hands on, men, women and children, raping them, chopping their heads off, forcing fathers to suicide bomb or they kill their whole family in front of them.
[00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:04.681]  I mean, the scum of the earth in our government, the people that run our government,
[00:37:07.785 --> 00:37:11.930]  ...are such villains that bipartisanly they've done this.
[00:37:12.391 --> 00:37:24.066]  And it was so over the top, our own military two, three years ago said no to being the air force for Al-Qaeda, no to toppling Assad, and so they had to go to a more of a covert approach.
[00:37:27.588 --> 00:37:34.034]  And they resupplied the Al-Qaeda forces and IS in Iraq with huge U.S.
[00:37:34.134 --> 00:37:39.298]  weapons caches that were recently created and deployed.
[00:37:40.439 --> 00:37:51.729]  And contractors are told, you go out to this old base that's shut down, it's got five Iraqis guarding it, you put 300 Toyota trucks with heavy 50-cals there, and you leave the keys inside the storage facility.
[00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:53.411]  Then the Iraqi troops
[00:37:55.154 --> 00:38:06.723]  Are sitting out there in the middle of nowhere, they've been paid off, they disappear, in drives the convoy, carrying men in the back of each truck to be resupplied right there at the base.
[00:38:06.763 --> 00:38:09.165]  C-130 lands, offloads more weapons.
[00:38:11.087 --> 00:38:14.869]  This is an absolutely mega evil operation.
[00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:19.993]  And it's so brazen, it's so naked, it's so evil.
[00:38:21.695 --> 00:38:23.276]  Keep using the word evil because that's what it is.
[00:38:23.696 --> 00:38:24.317]  It's so wicked.
[00:38:27.128 --> 00:38:32.511]  That they think they'll actually get away with it and I'm telling you there's another wrinkle to this baby.
[00:38:34.332 --> 00:38:41.416]  This is all meant to come out and further demonize America worldwide because all over the world people know our government is running this whole show.
[00:38:42.877 --> 00:38:55.224]  All over the world people know that America is no longer the good guys and they're saying Putin's the leader of the free world and that Putin's a hero and Americans all over the place, left and right, love Putin.
[00:38:56.735 --> 00:39:00.857]  Putin's a billionaire oligarch with all sorts of shady connections and a strong man.
[00:39:01.357 --> 00:39:11.703]  The difference is, though, he doesn't put fluoride in the people's water and he does have a breeding program so Russians don't go extinct and he is trying to build up their civilization, but nevertheless, he is a strong man.
[00:39:12.283 --> 00:39:26.270]  I wouldn't call him the paragon of perfect behavior, but compared to the absolute abject filth that has hijacked our culture and society, he is good.
[00:39:27.418 --> 00:39:28.819]  He is a lesser of two evils.
[00:39:31.622 --> 00:39:34.584]  Because Russia has been attacked, not the United States.
[00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:54.118]  And the very people that supposedly attacked us 14 years ago are now attacking Russian interests, and Russia dares to raise a hand against them, and all these bullies in the United States, and all these bullies in Israel, and all these bullies in Turkey, and all these bullies in Saudi Arabia, say, how dare you?
[00:39:54.138 --> 00:40:01.021]  We're going to send in more weapons, we're going to kill Russians, and we're going to take you out, we're going to fill body bags with you, how dare you?
[00:40:01.542 --> 00:40:02.202]  But I want to be clear.
[00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:17.534]  The average Turkish person, the average Israeli, the average Saudi Arabian, the average American, the average French person, does not back Al-Qaeda or Al-Nusra, does not like ISIS, and doesn't like what's happening, and wants our governments to take these people out.
[00:40:18.234 --> 00:40:19.814]  So they did fake airstrikes on them.
[00:40:20.014 --> 00:40:20.755]  That's been proven.
[00:40:20.935 --> 00:40:22.315]  The Iraqi government's gone public.
[00:40:29.335 --> 00:40:39.683]  So when I say shame on Israel, shame on the U.S., I mean shame on the power-mad demons, bipartisanly, in all of these major countries that are going with this globalist plan.
[00:40:43.586 --> 00:40:50.611]  It is the most nakedly evil America has ever been on the world stage.
[00:40:51.372 --> 00:40:57.476]  It is just total corruption, total
[00:40:58.616 --> 00:41:04.103]  Mind-blowing, twisted manipulation in front of the world.
[00:41:06.465 --> 00:41:09.088]  Russian airstrikes in Syria continue.
[00:41:09.148 --> 00:41:09.909]  Putin drafts 150,000.
[00:41:11.923 --> 00:41:12.223]  U.S.
[00:41:12.503 --> 00:41:13.724]  is in, quote, disarray.
[00:41:13.844 --> 00:41:15.025]  Iran troops are ready.
[00:41:15.545 --> 00:41:16.826]  Infowars.com.
[00:41:17.206 --> 00:41:23.089]  Iran has a Syrian army prepared to launch larger offensive against CIA proxies.
[00:41:23.509 --> 00:41:24.230]  All-out war.
[00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:27.151]  Iranian troops to conduct ground attacks in Syria.
[00:41:27.932 --> 00:41:33.275]  Meanwhile, back in America, Planned Parenthood had questions about sale of aborted babies are sexist.
[00:41:35.609 --> 00:41:36.310]  And it gets better.
[00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:45.297]  Twitter characterizes disagreeing, that's an actual quote, with someone's opinion as abusive behavior, and will ban you if you're criticizing, quote, liberalism.
[00:41:49.561 --> 00:41:50.321]  Can't make that up.
[00:41:50.642 --> 00:41:54.845]  I mean, meanwhile, they're teaching five-year-olds how to go to tranny bathrooms.
[00:41:55.506 --> 00:41:57.468]  Meanwhile, we're drinking fluoride.
[00:41:57.808 --> 00:42:03.032]  Meanwhile, we're being lectured on what words we can use by a bunch of totalitarians masquerading as liberals.
[00:42:03.072 --> 00:42:03.593]  What a joke!
[00:42:05.919 --> 00:42:10.872]  I want to go to Abu, Charlene, Garrett, Robert, Chris, and others.
[00:42:12.436 --> 00:42:14.141]  We hired a lady a few months ago.
[00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:20.890]  As we ease in our crew, we'll give you their full names and everything so they can be put to the crucible and attacked in the media.
[00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:23.231]  But Daria is a native Russian speaker.
[00:42:23.571 --> 00:42:26.733]  She's a graduate of the Defense Language School at Monterey, California.
[00:42:26.974 --> 00:42:29.535]  That's where two of the hijackers at least got trained.
[00:42:29.575 --> 00:42:33.638]  The Dean of the Defense Language School went public about that and got shut down.
[00:42:33.678 --> 00:42:34.359]  That's a side issue.
[00:42:35.239 --> 00:42:40.383]  She's been watching these Putin speeches and has shown us the Russian transcripts versus the U.S.
[00:42:40.423 --> 00:42:42.464]  transcripts, and it's night and day different.
[00:42:42.864 --> 00:42:45.146]  So she went in and did a transcript
[00:42:45.906 --> 00:42:46.727]  of the Putin U.N.
[00:42:46.767 --> 00:42:55.753]  speech, at least five minutes of it, from Tuesday, September 29th, just to show how incredibly different what you heard in the U.N.
[00:42:55.793 --> 00:43:02.037]  translation in the United States was versus what really happened.
[00:43:03.598 --> 00:43:05.499]  Putin's message lost in translation.
[00:43:05.519 --> 00:43:08.822]  Russian president's speech calls out key aspects of the new world order agenda.
[00:43:09.102 --> 00:43:12.384]  That's a very important article, but it needs to get more attention.
[00:43:12.404 --> 00:43:13.645]  So I want it republished
[00:43:15.069 --> 00:43:19.011]  Under the headline, media caught distorting Putin's speech.
[00:43:21.073 --> 00:43:24.815]  Media caught distorting Putin's UN speech.
[00:43:27.077 --> 00:43:33.120]  President Vladimir Putin called out the West's complicity in terrorism in real speech.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:33.861]  Something like that.
[00:43:34.824 --> 00:43:36.345]  Because it's a very important article.
[00:43:36.865 --> 00:43:44.888]  After Joe Biggs joins us with Jakari Jackson from the anti-gunner rally that's happening at UT, details are at Infowars.com in a red-linked article.
[00:43:46.008 --> 00:43:48.529]  We will get into that and play her report then.
[00:43:48.569 --> 00:43:59.094]  But first, before I go to your phone calls, here is a piece from the Washington Free Beacon, a mash-up of Obama first supporting the Syrian rebels, then saying he didn't support the rebels.
[00:43:59.314 --> 00:43:59.674]  Here it is.
[00:44:00.669 --> 00:44:14.486]  Many of you have, understandably, asked me questions about the claims of our critics, who suggest that the administration should invest more deeply in training and equipping members of the Syrian opposition, that that was the recipe for success.
[00:44:14.747 --> 00:44:19.352]  That is not something that this administration ever believed, but it is something that our critics will have to answer for.
[00:44:21.442 --> 00:44:31.429]  The President, for some time, has been concerned that the lawlessness and violence that we've seen in Syria does have a destabilizing, dangerous impact.
[00:44:31.469 --> 00:44:37.072]  A way to address that, in our view, is to bolster the moderate opposition, provide them additional assistance.
[00:44:37.213 --> 00:44:44.297]  We have a free Syrian army and a moderate opposition that we have steadily been working with, that we have vetted.
[00:44:44.517 --> 00:44:49.481]  At the West Point speech that I gave, I said, we need to put more resources into the moderate opposition.
[00:44:49.501 --> 00:44:50.722]  The President does believe that
[00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:58.226]  That there would be value to ramp up the assistance that we provide to members of the moderate Syrian opposition.
[00:44:58.647 --> 00:45:05.691]  Stepping up the efforts with respect to the moderate opposition is an essential piece of any strategy against ISIL.
[00:45:05.791 --> 00:45:09.674]  With this new effort, we'll provide training and equipment to help them grow stronger.
[00:45:12.642 --> 00:45:15.823]  But I think it's also time for our critics to fess up in this regard as well.
[00:45:16.403 --> 00:45:18.444]  Oh, it's time for us to fess up that we're wrong.
[00:45:19.064 --> 00:45:34.028]  Okay, here's Reuters saying that Russia wants at least 30 airstrikes on one base alone, the Army of Conquest group led by al-Nusra, an al-Qaeda Syrian branch.
[00:45:35.769 --> 00:45:40.490]  Well, yes, that's the command and control base where the West meets with the moderates, which is al-Qaeda.
[00:45:41.769 --> 00:45:55.833]  Who actually are just the grandpas and daddies of Islamic State that flies the exact same flags, the exact same people, they're just the average age of about 25, and are just the boots on the ground creating the new country because they're breaking up Syria and Iraq.
[00:45:56.233 --> 00:45:57.514]  Two different operations.
[00:45:58.014 --> 00:46:09.237]  Take part of Iraq, take part of Syria, let them create a new country, pay off the Saudi Arabia, have a new headquarters to launch terror attacks worldwide, then Western governments can take more of our freedoms.
[00:46:12.313 --> 00:46:14.135]  Iran troops to join Syrian war.
[00:46:14.255 --> 00:46:17.357]  Russia bombs group trained by CIA.
[00:46:17.478 --> 00:46:18.078]  That's Reuters.
[00:46:19.519 --> 00:46:21.381]  And again, who does Reuters say the group is?
[00:46:21.981 --> 00:46:22.882]  Al-Qaeda!
[00:46:23.323 --> 00:46:25.324]  That's how dumb they think you are!
[00:46:25.705 --> 00:46:32.871]  In a Reuters article, Russia's bombing Al-Qaeda that leads the good Syrian rebels.
[00:46:35.583 --> 00:46:38.745]  I mean, do you understand how evil our government is, folks?
[00:46:39.545 --> 00:46:40.366]  Let me explain something.
[00:46:40.926 --> 00:46:42.547]  I don't want to sit here and say this.
[00:46:42.587 --> 00:46:44.368]  This is a setup to bring our country down.
[00:46:44.949 --> 00:46:46.369]  This is diabolical, folks.
[00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:54.334]  The whole world's turning against America right now, and this was all done by design by the American-hating scum that set this up back in the 70s.
[00:46:54.394 --> 00:46:55.735]  It was Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[00:46:56.906 --> 00:47:21.284]  This is a globalist master plan to turn jihad forces loose all over to take over, cause a religious civil war between Shiites and Sunnis, out of which is the clash of civilizations, that world government will rise with a one world religion where you can't be a conservative Christian, but you've got to moderate and submit and dress how Muslims want you to.
[00:47:22.349 --> 00:47:32.193]  You can now see it all, the total radical plan to end the Renaissance by driving a giant radical Islamic harpoon right through our heart.
[00:47:36.055 --> 00:47:40.917]  I've said it for over a decade, Al-Qaeda is the master skeleton key that opens every door for the New World Order.
[00:47:40.937 --> 00:47:44.358]  It is the Saudi Arabian Turkish intelligence operation.
[00:47:45.118 --> 00:47:49.120]  It runs all the radical Muslim groups that are Sunni.
[00:47:50.896 --> 00:47:52.697]  The Shiite groups, again, are Hezbollah.
[00:47:53.398 --> 00:47:59.982]  They are mainly a military group, and they've been sitting back in the shadows, not launching terror attacks for a very, very long time.
[00:48:00.282 --> 00:48:11.609]  But yes, if we have an all-out war with the Iranians, they will activate sleeper cells all over the West, and you won't have young 25-year-old jihadis running around shooting up schools and stuff.
[00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:14.812]  You will have attacks on government facilities, which
[00:48:15.652 --> 00:48:16.772]  That's what the New World Order wants.
[00:48:17.092 --> 00:48:20.633]  That'll destabilize the government further, bringing in total globalist rule.
[00:48:21.454 --> 00:48:23.454]  Man, you can see the master takeover plan.
[00:48:23.534 --> 00:48:25.415]  It makes my head spin.
[00:48:27.215 --> 00:48:29.276]  And now, we're in toe-to-toe.
[00:48:30.896 --> 00:48:42.359]  War with US forces, NATO forces, fighting Russians, with the Israelis announcing they're going to begin airstrikes against Syrian Assad government forces.
[00:48:43.968 --> 00:48:50.530]  Who have been fighting a giant proxy army for five years valiantly.
[00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:52.771]  I mean, you can't but root for them.
[00:48:53.011 --> 00:48:53.751]  They didn't start it.
[00:48:53.931 --> 00:48:54.611]  They didn't do it.
[00:48:54.831 --> 00:48:55.552]  They're moderate.
[00:48:56.172 --> 00:48:56.972]  They're normal.
[00:48:57.572 --> 00:49:00.233]  They're not committing crimes.
[00:49:00.653 --> 00:49:02.874]  They are fighting against the trash of the planet.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.562]  And it is just so over-the-top evil.
[00:49:06.882 --> 00:49:14.467]  And then out of this is a general demonization of Muslims and the clash of civilization, which the globalists want to divide and conquer people as well.
[00:49:15.267 --> 00:49:21.411]  And then Saudi Arabia is given total control over all of the Muslim world to basically kingpin that whole operation.
[00:49:21.711 --> 00:49:23.592]  And again, that's British intelligence all over again.
[00:49:25.053 --> 00:49:30.757]  We're going to go to break and come right back and go to Habu, Charlene, Garrett, Robert, Chris, and others very, very briefly.
[00:49:30.817 --> 00:49:31.978]  Today is the last day
[00:49:33.473 --> 00:49:39.337]  To get the lowest prices that we have ever offered on storable food.
[00:49:39.457 --> 00:49:40.818]  We work with My Patriot Supply.
[00:49:40.838 --> 00:49:54.627]  We've got their full range, their best specials at InfowarsStore.com, but we can get around contract rules they have, but if we did a private label, which is just their sticker, but now it's Infowars, select on their full food line
[00:49:55.506 --> 00:49:57.247]  They can then give me even lower.
[00:49:57.267 --> 00:49:59.688]  They're just like, sure, if you don't want to really make any profit, we'll go lower.
[00:49:59.988 --> 00:50:00.668]  We're free market.
[00:50:01.388 --> 00:50:04.049]  And so this is the lowest price they've ever offered.
[00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:06.290]  I had their CEO on two weeks ago.
[00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:07.870]  Today is the last day.
[00:50:08.031 --> 00:50:12.072]  At midnight, the shopping cart is programmed to end this special.
[00:50:12.272 --> 00:50:13.032]  Go check it out.
[00:50:13.413 --> 00:50:14.253]  Look at it for yourself.
[00:50:14.273 --> 00:50:16.854]  You want to augment your storable food, or if you want to expand,
[00:50:18.021 --> 00:50:18.181]  Here's
[00:50:39.685 --> 00:50:43.086]  Plastic tote containers better than the stuff you see at Walmart.
[00:50:43.387 --> 00:50:44.547]  They really are the leader.
[00:50:44.887 --> 00:50:47.228]  This food is recently packaged.

[00:51:28.087 --> 00:51:30.989]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.

[00:52:12.316 --> 00:52:15.516]  Their age should give them a great advantage to feeling good all the time.
[00:52:15.916 --> 00:52:21.517]  However, young people of today are dealing with the same nutrient-deficient food as everyone else in America.
[00:52:21.837 --> 00:52:23.858]  So it does not matter whether you are 15 or 85.

[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:46.387]  Since I started taking the new Technology Enhance One World Way after work, I have so much energy when I get home that I'm able to take long walks, do chores, and even honey to-do lists from the wife.
[00:52:46.647 --> 00:52:51.190]  It's plenty enough energy to get things done around the house and time to settle down before bedtime.
[00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:55.413]  This whey protein gives me outstanding amount of long-lasting feel-good energy.

[00:54:21.712 --> 00:54:22.173]  That's crazy.
[00:54:22.233 --> 00:54:28.997]  You probably play this bumper music that Jimmy Vaughn recorded for the show a few years ago against RFID chips.
[00:54:31.138 --> 00:54:33.399]  And I was just thinking about Jimmy Vaughn.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:37.302]  Though I might think about him once a week or something.
[00:54:37.762 --> 00:54:39.003]  I was just thinking about him.
[00:54:41.698 --> 00:54:48.300]  My kids play with his daughters right as I was coming out of break and then some of his music played, which we might play, I don't know, once a month or something.
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:49.420]  That's just crazy.
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:51.660]  Serendipity, synchronicity, what do you call it?
[00:54:52.921 --> 00:54:54.141]  And you know, I have children.
[00:54:54.721 --> 00:54:55.701]  A lot of you have children.
[00:54:56.101 --> 00:54:57.402]  I just want to have a civilization.
[00:54:57.422 --> 00:54:58.502]  I just want to live and let live.
[00:54:59.822 --> 00:55:01.883]  If a country messes with us, I want to stand up to them.
[00:55:02.783 --> 00:55:05.343]  But our country's been hijacked and taken control of.
[00:55:05.363 --> 00:55:08.124]  It's being used as an engine of evil worldwide.
[00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:17.232]  And now the Russians and others are massing forces to fight the Saudi Arabian proxy army.
[00:55:19.374 --> 00:55:21.735]  And Saudi Arabia is saying, fine, we're going to escalate.
[00:55:22.056 --> 00:55:26.899]  And this is how wars get really, really out of control very, very quickly.
[00:55:29.121 --> 00:55:30.422]  And Neil Cavuto says to
[00:55:31.886 --> 00:55:32.646]  Then I'm going to your calls.
[00:55:33.627 --> 00:55:38.930]  Neil Cavuto says to John McCain, well isn't escalating this, sending more troops and weapons, going to escalate?
[00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:40.371]  And McCain goes, yes!
[00:55:41.872 --> 00:55:42.752]  Yeah, there's a problem.
[00:55:42.852 --> 00:55:44.153]  Obama isn't escalating.
[00:55:46.414 --> 00:55:47.795]  But Obama is escalating.
[00:55:48.215 --> 00:55:51.457]  Everything is just deceiving the public with a straight face.
[00:55:51.497 --> 00:55:52.618]  It's so sick!
[00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:59.782]  And to see them put America clearly in the position of being the bad guys.
[00:56:01.752 --> 00:56:05.614]  Because we've been above the law and arrogant for so long, makes my head spin.
[00:56:06.294 --> 00:56:08.195]  Let's go to Habu and then other callers.
[00:56:08.235 --> 00:56:09.536]  Habu, you're on the air, welcome.
[00:56:11.217 --> 00:56:14.278]  Yeah, good day to you and thank you very much for the opportunity.
[00:56:15.199 --> 00:56:21.622]  What you've said so far is spot on from where I sit, but may I just offer a couple of brief comments?
[00:56:23.263 --> 00:56:25.804]  One is, now we can see in hindsight
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:42.210]  That the whole migrant refugee crisis was a spectacle that was staged so that, you know, they could pull at the world's heart and make it look like, you know, this was all the doing of Assad in Syria.
[00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:49.474]  Actually, these were coming from the million or so that are in Turkish camps, and they were including Pakistanis and everybody else.
[00:56:49.914 --> 00:56:54.117]  It was all to make Assad look like the boogeyman, and that also
[00:56:58.124 --> 00:57:00.566]  If I may say this, I'm a little nervous here.
[00:57:02.207 --> 00:57:11.655]  Putin already saw the game when Hollande of France and Cameron were threatening to strike Syria, saying this kind of stuff has to stop.
[00:57:12.036 --> 00:57:13.016]  But this was all the setup.
[00:57:13.056 --> 00:57:14.698]  This was, you know, attack 2.0.
[00:57:16.019 --> 00:57:19.462]  1.0 was the Ghouta gassing, which was another false flag.
[00:57:20.074 --> 00:57:36.643]  So, Putin already beat them to the punch by sending MiG-31s, because he knew that that would stop them from bombing, you know, just having a free, a Turkish shoot in Syria by these NATO.
[00:57:36.863 --> 00:57:38.804]  So that has completely stopped them in their tracks.
[00:57:39.924 --> 00:57:43.026]  And the second thing is, as an observer, I think
[00:57:43.766 --> 00:57:48.490]  Russia and China have just had too much, not so much Iran, but they're going to join in.
[00:57:48.931 --> 00:57:55.036]  They've just said, this is where we're going to have our stand with American exceptionalism, this kind of exceptionalism.
[00:57:55.837 --> 00:57:57.519]  And, and, and they're going to make a point here.
[00:57:57.799 --> 00:58:01.643]  And, and, and Saudi Arabia is just a, you know, it's just a lightweight.
[00:58:01.923 --> 00:58:02.964]  These guys can't fight.
[00:58:03.224 --> 00:58:08.589]  These are punks who, who, you know, frequent the bordellos in Paris and Western capitals, but can't fight.
[00:58:09.096 --> 00:58:12.599]  These people, the Yemenis are knocking their socks off.
[00:58:13.239 --> 00:58:17.543]  These guys are knocking their high-powered planes out of the air.
[00:58:17.943 --> 00:58:20.165]  So these people are not even affected.
[00:58:20.385 --> 00:58:23.428]  All they have is money and armaments to have other people do it.
[00:58:23.788 --> 00:58:25.169]  So that is all, and thank you very much.
[00:58:25.209 --> 00:58:32.715]  Well, I tend to agree with you, but again, what is our government thinking putting America in the position of being totally wicked?
[00:58:33.096 --> 00:58:34.637]  It's so obvious to the whole world.
[00:58:34.657 --> 00:58:36.859]  Do you agree with me this is a larger setup?
[00:58:39.985 --> 00:58:46.311]  It is, but also, you know, I have to say this after Vietnam and Korea that... Hold on, stay there.
[00:58:46.331 --> 00:58:47.192]  I'm going to come back to you.
[00:58:47.212 --> 00:58:48.453]  I'm going to go to everybody else.
[00:58:48.473 --> 00:58:49.134]  Stay with us, folks.
[00:58:49.354 --> 00:58:50.115]  Back in one minute.
[00:58:50.155 --> 00:58:51.236]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:51.276 --> 00:58:52.978]  This is so ridiculous.
[00:58:52.998 --> 00:58:54.259]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:59.150 --> 00:59:02.372]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:59:02.672 --> 00:59:10.676]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:10.916 --> 00:59:15.939]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:59:16.339 --> 00:59:18.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:20.641]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:59:29.119 --> 00:59:30.039]  BrainForce is here.
[00:59:30.219 --> 00:59:32.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:37.182]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:59:37.422 --> 00:59:39.082]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[00:59:39.122 --> 00:59:40.583]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:59:40.703 --> 00:59:43.924]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:59:44.204 --> 00:59:45.985]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:59:46.185 --> 00:59:47.085]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:59:47.105 --> 00:59:48.045]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:59:48.325 --> 00:59:50.226]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:59:50.286 --> 00:59:55.888]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:00:01.679 --> 01:00:04.295]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:15.322 --> 01:00:19.524]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:20.164 --> 01:00:20.964]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.744 --> 01:00:22.665]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.285 --> 01:00:26.926]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.467 --> 01:00:31.588]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.748 --> 01:00:38.691]  We're taking phone calls right now on the build-up to what clearly could turn into World War III, if you just joined us.
[01:00:39.651 --> 01:00:42.757]  There's also another video feed we have up on InfoWars.com.
[01:00:42.817 --> 01:00:47.466]  Livestream InfoWars announces 2nd Amendment flash rally at UT Austin.
[01:00:48.939 --> 01:00:55.480]  It was two nights ago I noticed that they were going to have a Bloomberg group that normally only has five or six anti-gunners at their events.
[01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:56.540]  This is a bigger one.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.281]  Looks like they may have as many as eight people.
[01:00:59.541 --> 01:01:02.241]  Al Jazeera and others will announce that they had hundreds of thousands.
[01:01:02.281 --> 01:01:02.982]  I'm not kidding.
[01:01:03.522 --> 01:01:04.342]  I've seen them in D.C.
[01:01:04.382 --> 01:01:05.382]  claiming they had 200,000.
[01:01:05.442 --> 01:01:06.202]  It was like a thousand.
[01:01:06.222 --> 01:01:08.383]  It looks like they've got about eight or nine people there.
[01:01:08.403 --> 01:01:11.703]  I'm going to see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, maybe eleven.
[01:01:12.343 --> 01:01:13.864]  So that's a record crowd right there.
[01:01:13.904 --> 01:01:15.284]  The statesmen will probably report they had 5,000.
[01:01:16.944 --> 01:01:20.526]  Uh, and, uh, so we're down there to cover what's happening.
[01:01:20.967 --> 01:01:38.177]  Joe Biggs is going to be joining us, uh, popping in at the start of the next segment and then on again, off again, uh, throughout this, but the live feed of him, uh, hopefully interviewing some of these folks, uh, will be there, but they're here to victim us, guilt us that any crimes with guns are gun owners fault.
[01:01:38.857 --> 01:01:42.658]  I mean, if somebody kills somebody with a Ford truck, you don't blame every other F-150 owner.
[01:01:43.438 --> 01:01:44.679]  It's just crazy.
[01:01:45.059 --> 01:01:46.659]  So get out of Austin, Bloomberg.
[01:01:46.699 --> 01:01:47.659]  We see right through you.
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:52.901]  And there is a lot of folks out there that are exposing it.
[01:01:53.581 --> 01:01:57.062]  They've got signs up saying they're anti-gun with a gun with a slash through it.
[01:01:58.368 --> 01:02:02.169]  Oh, but they're not against government having guns, or Mao Zedong having guns.
[01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:10.212]  So, we're just here exposing it, and Joe Biggs is out there again doing interviews right now with folks.
[01:02:10.232 --> 01:02:15.714]  He'll be popping in with us, and I'll go back to your calls, and back to Joe Biggs here in the next hour.
[01:02:16.035 --> 01:02:19.876]  Habu, calling in from Wisconsin, you were finishing up your point.
[01:02:20.416 --> 01:02:22.017]  I know America isn't perfect.
[01:02:22.762 --> 01:02:26.626]  But I did study the Soviet Union and I mean it really was corrupt and out of control.
[01:02:26.967 --> 01:02:28.969]  So I could see some of the arguments of opposing it.
[01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:32.453]  But now we're just adopting everything the Soviet Union promoted.
[01:02:32.874 --> 01:02:34.576]  They're going in the opposite direction.
[01:02:34.996 --> 01:02:36.458]  The roles are totally reversed.
[01:02:36.858 --> 01:02:39.841]  And the people running our government are waging war on our freedoms.
[01:02:40.422 --> 01:02:49.649]  And they're also launching these incredibly evil destabilization moves that we know are meant to make the Middle East and Africa, you know, go back into the Stone Age.
[01:02:50.570 --> 01:02:51.771]  It's just so brazen.
[01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:53.412]  It's so out in the open.
[01:02:54.053 --> 01:02:55.674]  And I really think they've gone too far.
[01:02:55.714 --> 01:02:59.157]  And as you said, Russia especially.
[01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:05.011]  knows that it's being destabilized to be destroyed, so they know they've got to go ahead and fight back.
[01:03:05.091 --> 01:03:10.472]  Putin, I don't see as some super mastermind who's had a bunch of victories as the media spins it.
[01:03:10.872 --> 01:03:21.015]  Putin laid down to the Iraq takeover, laid down to Afghanistan takeover, laid down to four or five countries being invaded, and only now, because of Ukraine, is standing up.
[01:03:21.055 --> 01:03:23.635]  I mean, I was wondering when the Russians were going to do something.
[01:03:23.956 --> 01:03:29.857]  But that tends to be the Russian paradigm in about seven different wars, not just Napoleon or Hitler,
[01:03:30.377 --> 01:03:33.660]  Is to lay down until the very end and then stand up.
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:34.180]  Go ahead.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.141]  Where do you think this is going?
[01:03:37.122 --> 01:03:38.603]  You know, you're absolutely right.
[01:03:38.663 --> 01:03:46.168]  And I think Putin has bent over backwards to kind of accommodate and, you know, just be more accommodating.
[01:03:46.609 --> 01:03:47.649]  But but not anymore.
[01:03:47.689 --> 01:03:52.313]  I think right now there are two hot wars, so to speak, Ukraine and Syria.
[01:03:52.813 --> 01:03:58.557]  And I think that Syria, you know, making a stand in Ukraine was just too close to home.
[01:03:59.058 --> 01:03:59.498]  But here,
[01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:20.700]  Syria is probably a better way for them to deal with Saudi Arabia, United States, NATO, and I think if Saudi Arabia is so brazen as to, you know, do you recall it was also threatening the Sochi Olympics?
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:21.280]  Yes.
[01:04:21.861 --> 01:04:23.622]  And Putin told them in Norway,
[01:04:26.604 --> 01:04:26.784]  I don't
[01:04:40.968 --> 01:04:50.336]  Absolutely, and why we align ourselves with them, and because I suppose they buy our armaments and they're an outlet, plus they can manipulate the oil market.
[01:04:50.376 --> 01:04:53.159]  Well, they're sitting on top of Mecca so they can direct Islam.
[01:04:53.199 --> 01:05:00.225]  I mean, that's why British intelligence went and set up the Wahhabis to put them in charge, is because they would do whatever they're told and they're super nasty people.
[01:05:00.565 --> 01:05:07.772]  I don't mean the Saudi Arabians themselves that are being fed on, but the disgusting House of Saad is truly filthy.
[01:05:09.141 --> 01:05:12.983]  Just when you think the government couldn't get any more ludicrous, the U.S.
[01:05:13.023 --> 01:05:20.746]  Environmental Protection Agency has taken to social media to point out the harmful effects of sunny days on plant life.
[01:05:20.946 --> 01:05:21.486]  That's right.
[01:05:21.646 --> 01:05:24.767]  The agency tweeted, Think sunny days are good for plants?
[01:05:25.068 --> 01:05:25.708]  Not always.
[01:05:25.988 --> 01:05:30.550]  Sunlight causes ozone to form, which harms foliage and weakens trees.
[01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:36.995]  Makes you wonder, how did the planet survive for millennia before a big bloated government came along to protect it?
[01:05:37.315 --> 01:05:48.323]  Let's just point out the absurdity of the EPA highlighting the alleged danger of sunlight as the world is facing numerous legitimate environmental issues, some of which have been caused by the agency itself.
[01:05:48.524 --> 01:05:57.991]  Let's not forget this is the same agency that polluted the Animas River with more than 3 million gallons of toxic waste last month in an effort to cover up that disaster.
[01:05:58.451 --> 01:06:02.552]  EPA officials refused to provide data to the press on the extent of the damage.
[01:06:02.872 --> 01:06:08.613]  Read the article, Obama's EPA warns sunlight dangerous to plants at InfoWars.com.

[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:17.845]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:07:17.925 --> 01:07:26.170]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:26.330 --> 01:07:31.032]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:31.232 --> 01:07:34.874]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[01:07:36.155 --> 01:07:36.876]  We're good to go.
[01:08:00.057 --> 01:08:06.200]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:08.061]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:08:12.062 --> 01:08:18.085]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:18.705 --> 01:08:21.687]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:35.436 --> 01:08:41.562]  Joe Biggs and Josh Owens are down at the University of Texas in downtown Austin.
[01:08:41.863 --> 01:08:45.226]  This radio slash TV transmission comes to you from deep in the heart of Texas.
[01:08:45.706 --> 01:08:57.098]  We're trying to work out some audio issues right now, but if you're a TV viewer at Infowars.com forward slash show or on some cable and TV stations already picking up the transmission, you can see that
[01:08:58.154 --> 01:08:58.354]  Yeah.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:27.027]  In the article titled, Livestream Infowars Announces 2nd Amendment Flash Rally at UT Austin, the anti-gunners are in there saying, we're going to be there with the police to make sure you don't have free speech.
[01:09:27.408 --> 01:09:28.428]  This is our rally.
[01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:34.352]  Well, funny, we've had rallies at UT and the Capitol, probably, let's not exaggerate, 200 times.
[01:09:35.112 --> 01:09:37.394]  I've probably been involved in 100 of those the last 20 years.
[01:09:38.574 --> 01:09:39.175]  Probably more than 100.
[01:09:40.795 --> 01:09:42.355]  Maybe 300 total, and I've been involved in 150?
[01:09:42.475 --> 01:09:43.096]  I don't know.
[01:09:43.696 --> 01:09:45.296]  And they're always there with their signs.
[01:09:45.316 --> 01:09:46.776]  They're always there talking to the media.
[01:09:47.137 --> 01:09:56.279]  But see, oh, now UT, if you're not a student-sanctioned group, or not sanctioned by the university, why you're going to jail.
[01:09:56.839 --> 01:10:01.380]  And there you have it, the taxpayer paid for, tolerant university,
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:06.863]  And if you were watching five minutes ago, you were able to see, because it's a separate feed than the show.
[01:10:06.883 --> 01:10:08.483]  They have two feeds going right now.
[01:10:09.024 --> 01:10:09.924]  They had signs up.
[01:10:10.024 --> 01:10:12.946]  That's what they were arrested for, was having signs.
[01:10:13.426 --> 01:10:21.230]  You're not allowed to go to the Bloomberg event, where he spends billions of dollars all over the country trying to get our guns.
[01:10:23.211 --> 01:10:24.352]  You're not allowed to do that.
[01:10:24.552 --> 01:10:28.654]  You are arrested if you hold up a sign and engage in free speech.
[01:10:28.994 --> 01:10:30.675]  Oh, the universities are so free.
[01:10:32.948 --> 01:10:33.989]  Biggs is ready.
[01:10:34.029 --> 01:10:39.011]  Let's go ahead and go to Joe Biggs as they show them being the political criminals, the political prisoners.
[01:10:39.811 --> 01:10:42.213]  Let's go to Joe Biggs reporting from University of Texas.
[01:10:42.553 --> 01:10:47.575]  Everybody's got to get down there now, folks, to witness the destruction of the First Amendment, not just the Second.
[01:10:47.595 --> 01:10:48.035]  Joe Biggs?
[01:10:48.996 --> 01:10:49.436]  Roger that.
[01:10:49.476 --> 01:10:51.397]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[01:10:51.417 --> 01:10:56.359]  We're standing at the UT campus and as you could have seen just a second ago, two people were arrested for protesting.
[01:10:56.639 --> 01:10:59.741]  Now, they stood behind the anti-gun protesters and held up their signs
[01:11:00.077 --> 01:11:01.838]  I'm saying that they were for Campus Carry.
[01:11:02.098 --> 01:11:06.279]  The cops came over, took them away, denied them the ability of freedom of speech.
[01:11:06.659 --> 01:11:21.924]  Meanwhile, letting this rhetoric go on over here, they're not going to bother them at all because it's okay for these anti-gunners to be out here and talk about stuff, completely ignoring the fact that one in five women here get raped and denying them that ability to protect themselves.
[01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:25.565]  And they think that when Campus Carry passes, there'll be a whole bunch of people running around with guns.
[01:11:25.905 --> 01:11:26.605]  That's a negative.
[01:11:26.665 --> 01:11:31.727]  Most of the students here from 18 to 20 in the state of Texas to have a CHL you have to be 21 or older.
[01:11:32.087 --> 01:11:35.908]  Most of those people are probably going to be a lot of the vets who are coming back using their GI Bill.
[01:11:36.228 --> 01:11:39.329]  And just because you have campus carry doesn't mean that people will be doing it.
[01:11:39.569 --> 01:11:43.110]  They just have that ability, that right to make that decision if they want to.
[01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:43.490]  That's right.
[01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:49.394]  That's why the Bloomberg people are here as the state legislature has moved to allow people to be armed on campus.
[01:11:49.815 --> 01:11:54.298]  Criminals are going to be armed regardless of what there's a law or not.
[01:11:54.798 --> 01:12:04.325]  But here are the Bloomberg people, when they were here two years ago, we have it on video with Council Member Mike Martinez saying, after we register, we will confiscate Austinites' guns.
[01:12:04.605 --> 01:12:07.968]  We have them on video with them hitting us in the head with their signs.
[01:12:08.408 --> 01:12:10.330]  We didn't even ask the cops to arrest them.
[01:12:10.770 --> 01:12:12.312]  We allowed them to have their free speech.
[01:12:12.592 --> 01:12:14.794]  But here they are, running around.
[01:12:14.814 --> 01:12:17.117]  Now, I was watching the live feed during a break.
[01:12:17.177 --> 01:12:18.718]  Correct me if I'm wrong, Joe Biggs down there.
[01:12:19.058 --> 01:12:22.482]  They arrested the pro-gunners for only holding up signs, correct?
[01:12:23.154 --> 01:12:34.339]  Yes, they weren't doing anything except standing behind the crowd of anti-gun people and then the cops rushed over like a bunch of Nazis and took away their ability to have freedom of speech and threw them in the back of a car and just took them downtown.
[01:12:34.519 --> 01:12:35.480]  Now we got two feeds.
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.260]  You're back there where the anti-gunners are.
[01:12:37.341 --> 01:12:40.442]  Josh is showing us a feed where they're taking them to jail.
[01:12:40.922 --> 01:12:44.204]  Please continue with what you've been witnessing with these anti-gunners.
[01:12:44.804 --> 01:12:45.844]  Well, we're gonna walk over here right now.
[01:12:45.864 --> 01:12:47.325]  There's a large group of people over here.
[01:12:47.365 --> 01:12:49.186]  They've had people coming up singing songs.
[01:12:50.004 --> 01:12:52.005]  Uh, basically just spreading a whole bunch of lies.
[01:12:52.025 --> 01:12:58.487]  They're saying that having students on campus... Again, we've got audio, Skype, and video.
[01:12:58.507 --> 01:12:59.608]  ...does not make the campus safer.
[01:13:00.228 --> 01:13:06.771]  They're saying that, uh, that having guns on campus will make it more dangerous and not as safe.
[01:13:07.111 --> 01:13:17.395]  So they want... They've already got 160 professors here at the college who have signed a petition to deny that law, that right, that's been passed, campus carry.
[01:13:18.206 --> 01:13:20.026]  It's not going to go into effect until August 26th.
[01:13:20.046 --> 01:13:22.887]  But people are going to die.
[01:13:23.027 --> 01:13:25.708]  Alright Joe, your Skype's breaking up.
[01:13:25.748 --> 01:13:27.508]  I'm going to give you a moment for that to stabilize.
[01:13:27.888 --> 01:13:30.069]  I see Jakari Jackson's in the control room.
[01:13:30.449 --> 01:13:32.049]  That means he probably wants to say something.
[01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:34.910]  Jakari, what's your view on the situation?
[01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:36.771]  Pretty powerful footage.
[01:13:37.231 --> 01:13:40.632]  One camera's giving us HD quality and we can see the people being arrested.
[01:13:40.652 --> 01:13:42.892]  The other is degrading that Biggs has.
[01:13:42.912 --> 01:13:44.432]  We're going to go back to Biggs in a moment.
[01:13:44.452 --> 01:13:45.753]  Jakari Jackson in studio.
[01:13:45.793 --> 01:13:46.313]  What's your take?
[01:13:46.613 --> 01:13:50.075]  Yeah, this is pretty ridiculous, Alex, because I have to do the nightly news tonight.
[01:13:50.115 --> 01:13:53.677]  I wasn't even planning to go down there because, you know, Biggs is going to do a great job.
[01:13:53.717 --> 01:13:58.979]  But after seeing this, the guy that you see on the camera right there wearing the InfoWars shirt, that's AJ.
[01:13:59.039 --> 01:14:01.240]  I've marched with him numerous times.
[01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:02.781]  You know, he's not a troublemaker.
[01:14:02.821 --> 01:14:04.182]  He's a veteran, matter of fact.
[01:14:04.502 --> 01:14:08.384]  And now they're going to arrest this guy for just holding up a sign in the United States of America.
[01:14:08.784 --> 01:14:13.028]  I think I might have to get in my car and go down to this UT campus to expose all the tyranny.
[01:14:13.048 --> 01:14:17.733]  This is what a police state looks like when you can't even hold up a sign on a college campus.
[01:14:18.073 --> 01:14:19.875]  These guys aren't out there waving guns around.
[01:14:19.895 --> 01:14:25.240]  They're out there holding up a sign and that's just too much for these people to accept at the University of Texas.
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:29.202]  Well, I'll tell you, these police officers are following shameful directives.
[01:14:29.763 --> 01:14:43.472]  Major universities have come out in the last month in their policy papers and said to students, there is no such thing as free speech, you don't hold up a sign, you don't talk to people about politics, or we will have you thrown off or put on academic suspension.
[01:14:43.832 --> 01:14:50.097]  And I have a good friend at UT going through the psychology department PhD, and they told him,
[01:14:50.797 --> 01:14:57.019]  You will not criticize political correctness or you will be kicked off campus and he was put on probation for his speech.
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.481]  If he makes one mistake, his entire paper's thrown out.
[01:15:00.881 --> 01:15:04.462]  The liberals can make a hundred mistakes and are just passed.
[01:15:04.822 --> 01:15:06.163]  And this guy's a liberal, by the way.
[01:15:06.443 --> 01:15:10.064]  He says it is a piranha of mental... just like piranhas, Jakari.
[01:15:10.384 --> 01:15:14.946]  And this is what these universities are now, is nothing but Soviet brainwashing centers.
[01:15:14.986 --> 01:15:15.306]  Go ahead.
[01:15:16.553 --> 01:15:22.114]  Yeah, just like you were mentioning earlier, you know, when I first met these guys, it was myself, David Knight, and also David's wife.
[01:15:22.495 --> 01:15:32.097]  We went out to a rally that they were having at the Capitol building, and Mike Martinez was out there, the Austin City Council member, saying that, you know, we're going to make the gun ban legitimate.
[01:15:32.117 --> 01:15:34.398]  You know, these people will go up to you, lie to your face.
[01:15:34.418 --> 01:15:35.898]  They lied to you and Gucci Arty.
[01:15:36.278 --> 01:15:43.863]  When you were in San Antonio, they said we're not trying to ban any guns by simultaneously handing you a flyer that says we want to ban all assault rifles.
[01:15:44.163 --> 01:15:50.847]  And Kit Daniels has the article out today, you're more likely to be stabbed with a knife than you are to be killed with a fully automatic rifle.
[01:15:51.107 --> 01:15:55.310]  You're more likely to have your brains beat out with a hammer than you are to be killed with a fully automatic rifle.
[01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:55.870]  Total hoax.
[01:15:55.890 --> 01:15:57.371]  We're going to come back to you in a moment, Jakar.
[01:15:57.391 --> 01:15:58.971]  I know you're about to get suited up and go down there.
[01:15:59.331 --> 01:16:04.233]  Everybody should go down there, folks, because I knew the issue would be they'd arrest people for free speech.
[01:16:04.613 --> 01:16:13.095]  They're saying if you talk to someone about your views, you're going to be arrested, because only the university decides who's allowed to speak, including students.
[01:16:13.395 --> 01:16:17.136]  This is beyond the old Soviet Union, beyond communist China today.
[01:16:17.457 --> 01:16:19.497]  America is falling to totalitarianism.
[01:16:19.857 --> 01:16:21.378]  Joe Biggs, we've gotten your Skype back.
[01:16:21.398 --> 01:16:22.018]  Please continue.
[01:16:23.545 --> 01:16:25.327]  Oh, just now coming in.
[01:16:27.289 --> 01:16:27.930]  Did you say something?
[01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:28.590]  I'm sorry you cut out.
[01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:31.473]  Yeah, it looks like somebody's over there telling you what you can and can't do.
[01:16:31.493 --> 01:16:36.858]  Oh, yeah, they're trying to tell us that, uh, you know, you can only, you have to have a permit to be able to speak out here at the UT camp.
[01:16:36.918 --> 01:16:37.459]  Oh, no, I know.
[01:16:37.519 --> 01:16:38.460]  Turn the camera on him.
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:42.864]  That guy right there was just telling you that you can't, he's calling the police, I think.
[01:16:43.004 --> 01:16:44.986]  He was just saying you can't be a news reporter.
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.361]  You heard me a minute ago.
[01:16:47.421 --> 01:16:48.161]  No, I'm asking you right now.
[01:16:48.181 --> 01:16:49.862]  You don't want to repeat... I'm asking you.
[01:16:49.902 --> 01:16:50.923]  You don't even want to report it.
[01:16:51.583 --> 01:16:52.504]  I'm letting you report it.
[01:16:52.524 --> 01:16:53.104]  Why don't you say it?
[01:16:53.525 --> 01:16:53.805]  Okay.
[01:16:54.225 --> 01:16:56.406]  If they want to register to have a protest here, they can.
[01:16:56.427 --> 01:16:58.808]  This is a registered space for protests.
[01:16:58.868 --> 01:17:00.949]  It's been like that for... Yeah, but that's ridiculous.
[01:17:01.069 --> 01:17:02.490]  To register to have free speech?
[01:17:02.911 --> 01:17:05.252]  I need you to register to have this conversation with me.
[01:17:05.432 --> 01:17:08.274]  And then you guys think that it's only okay for cops to have guns?
[01:17:08.294 --> 01:17:11.116]  You ever heard of Samuel DuBose, who was murdered by a trained cop?
[01:17:11.356 --> 01:17:13.518]  You ever heard of Kelly Thomas, who was murdered by a trained cop?
[01:17:14.478 --> 01:17:15.919]  No, I'm asking the police for permission.
[01:17:16.379 --> 01:17:18.721]  I'm not asking the police for permission.
[01:17:18.781 --> 01:17:20.101]  That's not accurate, what you're saying.
[01:17:20.262 --> 01:17:23.904]  Oh, so you think the freedom of speech is to get a permit from the government?
[01:17:24.024 --> 01:17:24.684]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:17:25.405 --> 01:17:26.625]  You're what's wrong with this country, sir.
[01:17:26.645 --> 01:17:31.468]  Correct me if I'm wrong, because I thought I heard him telling you you had to have permission to be reporting, or did I hear that wrong?
[01:17:31.648 --> 01:17:32.469]  ...come here and do a protest.
[01:17:32.489 --> 01:17:35.991]  There's just not a lot of... Yeah, that's the whole point.
[01:17:36.011 --> 01:17:37.172]  You can have a counter-protest.
[01:17:37.652 --> 01:17:38.212]  Yeah, they can.
[01:17:38.232 --> 01:17:39.913]  They can have a counter-protest over here.
[01:17:40.674 --> 01:17:41.894]  They were asked to leave the state.
[01:17:41.934 --> 01:17:42.635]  That's ridiculous.
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:43.801]  That's not true.
[01:17:43.821 --> 01:17:46.045]  UP says you gotta have a permit to do one, period.
[01:17:46.146 --> 01:17:49.492]  But you could ask the police if you'd like to have an interview to find out why they do that.
[01:17:49.532 --> 01:17:51.195]  We'd be happy to give you that interview.
[01:17:51.215 --> 01:17:51.516]  No, I'm good.
[01:17:51.536 --> 01:17:52.117]  I can find it.
[01:17:52.137 --> 01:17:53.920]  Ask that guy who he is.
[01:17:54.541 --> 01:17:54.782]  Who?
[01:17:54.822 --> 01:17:55.222]  What's your name?
[01:17:55.942 --> 01:17:58.784]  You can ask them about that.
[01:17:58.804 --> 01:18:00.625]  We'd be happy to set up an interview for you.
[01:18:00.805 --> 01:18:04.567]  If your interest is in understanding the story, we'd be happy to set that up.
[01:18:04.827 --> 01:18:06.629]  Okay, get him to say who he is with UT then.
[01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:08.970]  Get him Jones right now.
[01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.930]  What's your job with UT?
[01:18:10.271 --> 01:18:12.052]  You can't even answer my question.
[01:18:12.492 --> 01:18:15.114]  I can't talk to all four of you guys at once.
[01:18:15.134 --> 01:18:16.494]  They want me to ask, what's your job with UT?
[01:18:16.895 --> 01:18:18.396]  I'm Director of Media Outreach.
[01:18:18.876 --> 01:18:23.859]  And I'd be happy to set up an interview with the police so you could find out why they conduct an operation like that.
[01:18:24.872 --> 01:18:27.678]  We're interested in letting you know, you know, why it happens that way.
[01:18:28.059 --> 01:18:30.866]  I can't answer like 35 questions at once from you guys.
[01:18:31.246 --> 01:18:32.349]  Okay, so we're not talking.
[01:18:32.389 --> 01:18:33.010]  Answer the question.
[01:18:34.522 --> 01:18:36.723]  So if you're director of media, how come you're claiming we're not media?
[01:18:37.043 --> 01:18:37.983]  I mean, is this... I'm media.
[01:18:38.003 --> 01:18:38.563]  I never claimed that.
[01:18:38.583 --> 01:18:39.023]  Yeah, you did.
[01:18:39.043 --> 01:18:39.483]  You just did.
[01:18:40.023 --> 01:18:40.503]  I never did.
[01:18:40.523 --> 01:18:40.744]  You did.
[01:18:41.284 --> 01:18:41.664]  Absolutely.
[01:18:41.724 --> 01:18:42.364]  I never said that.
[01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:43.424]  I heard you with both ears.
[01:18:43.984 --> 01:18:46.265]  You got it on tape, so you're gonna have to find that on tape.
[01:18:46.385 --> 01:18:47.465]  We'll start a fight with him.
[01:18:47.505 --> 01:18:48.345]  Ask him this question.
[01:18:48.905 --> 01:18:53.527]  I've been told if I come to speak at UT without a permit anywhere, I'll be thrown off or arrested.
[01:18:53.967 --> 01:18:55.447]  So, uh... He's taking off.
[01:18:56.567 --> 01:18:58.908]  This is how they're using permitting in free speech zones.
[01:18:59.248 --> 01:19:00.028]  That's what they're doing.
[01:19:00.048 --> 01:19:01.829]  I've been listening to you for a long time.
[01:19:01.849 --> 01:19:02.389]  Thank you.
[01:19:02.489 --> 01:19:03.009]  Nine years.
[01:19:04.668 --> 01:19:10.271]  Yeah, I mean, it's completely ridiculous that you've got to sign up to be able to have the ability to say what you want to say.
[01:19:10.291 --> 01:19:18.174]  The point is, they come to UT... They're gonna use guys with guns to come bully you and put you in the back of a jail, but then they want to complain about guns.
[01:19:18.314 --> 01:19:19.575]  I mean, it's completely ridiculous.
[01:19:19.935 --> 01:19:21.136]  Let's just disarm everybody.
[01:19:21.336 --> 01:19:23.177]  Let's ban cars because there's... What?
[01:19:23.217 --> 01:19:24.977]  Let's see how many people die a year from cars?
[01:19:25.017 --> 01:19:25.858]  Let's ban those too.
[01:19:26.801 --> 01:19:28.082]  I think cars are ridiculous.
[01:19:28.102 --> 01:19:32.847]  34,485 people were killed by cars last year so we should ban those.
[01:19:32.867 --> 01:19:34.248]  Meanwhile, 11,493 people were killed
[01:19:43.296 --> 01:19:46.437]  All right, Joe Biggs, stay there.
[01:19:47.257 --> 01:19:51.278]  I know we've got Charlene, Garrett, Robert, Chris, and Chris and others holding.
[01:19:51.718 --> 01:20:00.981]  I want to talk to Chris, who's an Iraq war vet, on his situation with the buildup for war with Syria, and the fact that the Russians are sending in thousands more troops.
[01:20:01.381 --> 01:20:05.982]  They just conscripted 150,000, and Chinese troops are massing as well.
[01:20:06.282 --> 01:20:07.123]  This is biblical.
[01:20:07.163 --> 01:20:07.663]  Stay with us.

[01:21:09.259 --> 01:21:13.501]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[01:21:13.681 --> 01:21:17.583]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[01:21:17.743 --> 01:21:24.906]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s, and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[01:21:25.107 --> 01:21:30.129]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[01:21:30.329 --> 01:21:38.793]  If you want to boost your omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.

[01:22:09.002 --> 01:22:12.505]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:13.246 --> 01:22:13.767]  It's true.
[01:22:13.867 --> 01:22:17.830]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:19.892]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:20.433 --> 01:22:24.897]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:25.197 --> 01:22:37.802]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[01:24:13.638 --> 01:24:21.447]  By the way, you'll see the Alex Jones Show, my original cameraman and radio producer, the guy that set guests up for the show, Mike Hanson.
[01:24:22.068 --> 01:24:23.950]  He's been around almost as long as Buckley Hammond.
[01:24:24.751 --> 01:24:28.736]  He lives out in Gonzales, Texas and took over his family business when his grandfather died.
[01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:33.898]  He said the ATF and other people have been all over the town the last year basically taking over the police department.
[01:24:34.338 --> 01:24:43.261]  He called me frantically during a break earlier and said there's ATF everywhere raiding people's houses, roadblocks, pointing guns at children.
[01:24:43.301 --> 01:24:48.502]  He says there's just hundreds of feds running around in Gonzales, Texas, a small town right now.
[01:24:50.273 --> 01:24:52.276]  And he's been frantically calling me during the break.
[01:24:52.356 --> 01:24:54.940]  Buckley, can you come in here and call Mike Hansen back?
[01:24:54.981 --> 01:25:00.609]  I mean, it's just, he was arguing with him and confronting him, and then the phone went dead last time I talked to him.
[01:25:01.627 --> 01:25:04.889]  So things have really gotten crazy.
[01:25:05.269 --> 01:25:19.316]  Here it is, you can see him frantically calling as the gun grabbing goes on covertly around the country and they're doing gun confiscations all over the nation with ATF groups against veterans, people with PTSD, folks they think didn't buy a gun correctly.
[01:25:19.677 --> 01:25:21.798]  It's mainly a war on law-abiding citizens.
[01:25:22.338 --> 01:25:25.060]  We're going to continue to cover what's happening at the Capitol next segment.
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:32.005]  In just a few minutes, I'm going to Charlene and other callers that are patiently holding on the epic level situation in Syria.
[01:25:32.125 --> 01:25:37.549]  I'm going to recap that, get into the latest on that front, and then the political correctness as well that's taking place.
[01:25:38.430 --> 01:25:39.671]  What's happening in the economy?
[01:25:39.751 --> 01:25:41.712]  I mean, it is insane asylum level.
[01:25:42.373 --> 01:25:47.396]  I can't believe how crazy things are getting, but tyrants just keep going and going until they
[01:25:48.311 --> 01:25:49.913]  Hit a brick wall, historically.
[01:25:50.394 --> 01:25:57.182]  And they do fantastical, crazy things, like our government openly aiding Al Qaeda, openly aiding ISIS, same group.
[01:25:57.623 --> 01:26:05.894]  The Russians just blew up the Al Qaeda command base in Syria, and Reuters said, no one knows why the Russians attack the moderate Al Qaeda group.
[01:26:06.954 --> 01:26:08.636]  It actually says Al-Qaeda in Reuters.
[01:26:09.177 --> 01:26:11.840]  Russian warplanes target insurgents in Syria but not Islamic State.
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:18.468]  And the Pentagon is criticizing him for bombing the moderate al-Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda Syrian branch.
[01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:21.800]  That's who runs it.
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:23.261]  That's who commands ISIS.
[01:26:23.721 --> 01:26:37.204]  Joe Biggs, what is it like for you being an army vet who fought Al-Qaeda in Iraq and Syria, got wounded quite a few times, to now see our government openly arming and aiding Al-Qaeda while our government tries to take our guns, Joe?
[01:26:38.204 --> 01:26:39.585]  It's completely disgusting, Alex.
[01:26:39.625 --> 01:26:49.427]  I mean, the fact that you go over there because you want to protect your country, you want to do the right thing, and then to find out that you're lied to, then you find out that the country that you were trying to help stabilize
[01:26:50.049 --> 01:26:58.178]  They pull everyone out, they create ISIS, they take over ISIS, and then, the supposed enemy, we start arming them!
[01:26:58.578 --> 01:27:05.466]  And we start allowing them to grow, and they're taking over oil fields, and now, they're one of the richest terrorist organizations in the world!
[01:27:06.445 --> 01:27:13.273]  And the government denies that they're helping him, but we keep getting proof day in and day out that our government is allowing these guys to be armed.
[01:27:13.593 --> 01:27:18.059]  I'm seeing pictures every day by Al-Nusra members on Twitter holding U.S.
[01:27:18.199 --> 01:27:18.879]  Army weapons.
[01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:24.586]  SAWs, which is a squad automatic weapon, a 240 Bravo, M14 sniper rifles, M4s.
[01:27:24.866 --> 01:27:26.108]  That's completely ridiculous.
[01:27:26.548 --> 01:27:31.534]  Those guys are being dropped off our weapons to use against our people.
[01:27:31.554 --> 01:27:36.500]  Well, they admit they give it to, quote, al-Nusra, the moderate group that's commanded by the CIA and others.
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.862]  Then they give it to the radical ISIS people.
[01:27:38.882 --> 01:27:40.104]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[01:27:40.224 --> 01:27:43.207]  Al-Qaeda is just as bad as ISIS and the same group, Joe.
[01:27:44.229 --> 01:27:44.789]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:44.809 --> 01:27:46.171]  I mean, as soon as
[01:27:46.946 --> 01:27:50.227]  But Al-Nusra, basically all they are is just like a stepping stone.
[01:27:50.247 --> 01:27:53.289]  People go in there, they kind of get warmed up, and then they move over into ISIS.
[01:27:53.349 --> 01:27:58.291]  It's kind of just like a little stepping stone for some people who kind of want to go over there, but then they're not quite ready.
[01:27:58.791 --> 01:28:02.772]  These guys, as soon as they get a little pressure on them, they just give everything off to ISIS.
[01:28:02.792 --> 01:28:03.913]  They're like, alright, you guys take it.
[01:28:04.193 --> 01:28:09.478]  Sure, it's a plausible deniability membrane so the West doesn't get caught arming IS.
[01:28:09.518 --> 01:28:12.621]  Now, that's why the Russians just blew it up, because they know the head of the snake.
[01:28:13.281 --> 01:28:14.202]  And I say, great job.
[01:28:14.242 --> 01:28:16.003]  I hope you kill all the Al-Qaeda people, Russia.
[01:28:16.064 --> 01:28:16.544]  Great job.
[01:28:17.144 --> 01:28:18.245]  Exactly.
[01:28:18.346 --> 01:28:22.109]  I mean, I don't see why anybody would have a problem with Putin doing that.
[01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:25.171]  If he wants to step in and take over, we've spent enough money in these wars.
[01:28:25.212 --> 01:28:27.654]  We've spent enough American lives in these wars.
[01:28:27.694 --> 01:28:30.016]  I think it's fine for someone else to come in and take over.
[01:28:30.674 --> 01:28:32.055]  Well, especially if they're killing Al-Qaeda.
[01:28:32.655 --> 01:28:33.415]  You're about to go to break.
[01:28:33.435 --> 01:28:35.036]  I'm going to come back and finish up with you and go to calls.
[01:28:35.056 --> 01:28:37.217]  But I notice I am hearing some cheering.
[01:28:37.237 --> 01:28:40.079]  There are about 10 people on the stage, flown in by Bloomberg.
[01:28:40.899 --> 01:28:43.200]  And they did find some UT idiots to come out, I guess.
[01:28:43.561 --> 01:28:47.262]  But some of them are pro-gunners and called for taking our guns, I guess.
[01:28:48.183 --> 01:28:50.764]  Yeah, they're all screaming, gun-free UT, gun-free UT.
[01:28:50.784 --> 01:28:57.868]  They're all getting up, telling sad little sob stories, completely ignoring the fact that one in five women are raped.
[01:28:59.369 --> 01:29:01.550]  Denying them the right to be able to protect themselves.
[01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:06.492]  They said that people on campus that have guns will make it more dangerous.
[01:29:07.852 --> 01:29:09.853]  Well, there's also a lot more robberies.
[01:29:10.493 --> 01:29:12.654]  They said police should only be armed.
[01:29:13.134 --> 01:29:21.697]  I guess they forget the fact that people like Kelly Thomas, who were murdered by trained police officers, people like Sam DuBose, who were shot and killed because he was missing a license plate.
[01:29:22.018 --> 01:29:24.719]  Those are the kind of people that we want to have to have only the guns.
[01:29:24.739 --> 01:29:25.579]  That makes a lot of sense.
[01:29:25.981 --> 01:29:27.322]  Now that's a recipe for tyranny.
[01:29:27.362 --> 01:29:30.905]  We need a separation of powers, a division of powers, a balance of powers.
[01:29:31.505 --> 01:29:32.886]  And that's what this comes down to.
[01:29:33.066 --> 01:29:48.378]  And look, these people, right to your face, the very same Bloomberg group, the very same people that are there today, that travel around the country, they have said to my face, Joe, we'll come back and talk about this, that no one wants your guns, no one's trying to take your guns, and their own handout says ban all the guns, basically.
[01:29:48.758 --> 01:29:52.621]  And as you said, they're chanting right now, only police should have guns.
[01:29:53.081 --> 01:29:55.523]  Yeah, that's called North Korea, you idiots.
[01:29:55.843 --> 01:29:56.403]  We'll be back.
[01:29:56.443 --> 01:29:56.924]  Stay with us.
[01:29:58.645 --> 01:29:59.545]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.045 --> 01:30:01.647]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.567 --> 01:30:05.269]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.946 --> 01:30:12.387]  Have you waited your whole life to become a mother?
[01:30:12.687 --> 01:30:15.808]  Well, you're probably a racist, sexist, homophobe.
[01:30:16.148 --> 01:30:30.052]  LGBT activists have already convinced the Midwives Alliance of North America to stop referring to their clients as women and mothers, and instead call them pregnant people and birthing individuals, so transsexuals won't get offended.
[01:30:30.752 --> 01:30:35.397]  Numerous midwives have protested this language change, calling it an attack on women.
[01:30:35.737 --> 01:30:50.112]  In an open letter, they say, by embracing the idea that any human, other than those in a class called women, can carry offspring to term, give birth to them, and nurse them, we are prioritizing gender identity over biological reality.
[01:30:50.752 --> 01:30:56.238]  Obviously this ideology contributes to the cultural erasure of women's unique power to give birth.
[01:30:56.679 --> 01:30:58.901]  It is encoded in our female bodies.
[01:30:59.202 --> 01:31:02.946]  That's what creates, nourishes, and births live offspring.

[01:31:28.473 --> 01:31:31.214]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system.
[01:31:31.434 --> 01:31:32.155]  We're good to go.

[01:33:34.606 --> 01:33:45.671]  And we're fighting here in the Republic to defend the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, you name it, the Fourth Amendment, the Tenth Amendment, while internationally our names being drugged to the mud, while our government
[01:33:48.015 --> 01:33:54.097]  Openly starts a proxy war with Russia and Syria, and now Chinese troops, Iranian troops are going in.
[01:33:54.137 --> 01:33:56.618]  The Russians are conscripting 150,000 people.
[01:33:57.439 --> 01:33:58.859]  It is a serious crisis.
[01:33:58.919 --> 01:34:06.282]  We're going to have a guest join us in the third hour, Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief, who's been warning of these confrontations coming.
[01:34:06.782 --> 01:34:12.704]  I know he'll probably have a little bit different interpretation than I do, but that's what it's all about, getting different perspectives.
[01:34:13.485 --> 01:34:14.545]  But this is how it happens.
[01:34:14.565 --> 01:34:16.446]  You wake up and wars have escalated.
[01:34:18.191 --> 01:34:23.814]  And now it's the potential for World War 3, or what the globalists call World War 4.
[01:34:24.514 --> 01:34:28.416]  I want to go to Chris and Charlene and Dave and others I know you've been holding.
[01:34:28.876 --> 01:34:35.119]  What happens is I get a bunch of calls, then I take some, then we get the next guest on, and by the time I get to your calls it's been an hour.
[01:34:35.399 --> 01:34:39.040]  But I appreciate you calling to give us your take on the serious situation.
[01:34:41.081 --> 01:34:41.962]  But it really is
[01:34:43.152 --> 01:34:50.036]  Unprecedented because America started the destabilization of the Middle East on purpose, under globalist control.
[01:34:50.617 --> 01:34:59.322]  And now we're backing the nastiest, most horrible people, and John McCain's saying, let's give anti-aircraft missiles to al-Nusra, which is al-Qaeda.
[01:35:00.723 --> 01:35:02.224]  And he meets with al-Qaeda.
[01:35:03.665 --> 01:35:04.325]  That's Reuters.
[01:35:04.565 --> 01:35:05.126]  Al-Qaeda.
[01:35:06.266 --> 01:35:09.969]  The Pentagon is upset that the moderate rebels, al-Qaeda,
[01:35:10.987 --> 01:35:13.288]  They say Al-Qaeda with a straight face.
[01:35:13.668 --> 01:35:20.931]  The Pentagon's upset and so is NATO and so is Turkey and so is Israel that the Russians are hitting the moderates.
[01:35:21.411 --> 01:35:25.813]  Al-Qaeda that came in from out of the country to attack.
[01:35:26.953 --> 01:35:32.676]  They're mainly Turkish refugees from other parts of the world that came into Syria and couldn't take over.
[01:35:32.956 --> 01:35:34.276]  Couldn't take over people's houses.
[01:35:34.316 --> 01:35:35.397]  Couldn't take over their farms.
[01:35:35.717 --> 01:35:36.937]  So now they've run into Turkey.
[01:35:37.318 --> 01:35:38.158]  They're not Syrian.
[01:35:39.497 --> 01:35:42.963]  They're part of the invasion force, and so, oh, we'll just take you to Europe.
[01:35:44.385 --> 01:35:46.128]  So now they can blow stuff up here.
[01:35:46.709 --> 01:35:50.295]  And don't worry, government will be more than happy to take our freedoms then to keep us safe.
[01:35:51.209 --> 01:35:58.495]  I want to go directly to your calls, but finishing up with Joe Biggs, and we'll pop in with him in the next hour with new developments as they unfold.
[01:35:58.835 --> 01:36:04.560]  Down there with the Bloomberg gun confiscation movement, getting huge press coverage.
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:10.865]  There's ten people leading it, a few hundred UT people out there, a mix of pro-gunners, anti-gunners.
[01:36:11.405 --> 01:36:15.529]  And they say, gun-free UT, but they had men with guns show up.
[01:36:16.549 --> 01:36:23.274]  And anybody else holding up signs in the crowd, which the anti-gunners always do at our events, was arrested at gunpoint.
[01:36:23.615 --> 01:36:30.059]  So they don't really mean a gun-free UT, they mean a free speech, free, and only the state having the monopoly of force.
[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:32.061]  Joe Biggs, final comments for now.
[01:36:32.933 --> 01:36:34.934]  So there was a professor who just spoke.
[01:36:34.954 --> 01:36:37.114]  She goes, I'm a feminist anti-gun professor.
[01:36:37.374 --> 01:36:40.815]  I'm not open to debate, but I'm willing to listen to your concerns.
[01:36:41.075 --> 01:36:42.135]  But there's no debate here.
[01:36:42.715 --> 01:36:43.215]  What is that?
[01:36:43.415 --> 01:36:44.756]  You're not open to debate?
[01:36:44.816 --> 01:36:45.256]  It's double speak.
[01:36:45.276 --> 01:36:45.796]  Say that again.
[01:36:45.996 --> 01:36:48.857]  That's why feminists are loony.
[01:36:48.877 --> 01:36:51.437]  I'm not open to debate.
[01:36:51.477 --> 01:36:53.938]  I'm open to debate, but I will not listen to you and you're not allowed to speak.
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:58.481]  And then they're sitting here, they're like, well, thank you for coming out to this free speech event.
[01:36:58.561 --> 01:37:02.903]  Meanwhile, they called cops to come over and arrest people for freedom of speech.
[01:37:02.923 --> 01:37:03.983]  Well, that's their double speak.
[01:37:06.644 --> 01:37:07.704]  It's completely mind blowing.
[01:37:07.724 --> 01:37:11.985]  They're sitting there saying, well, there was a guy in Virginia Tech who was shot by a gun and he had no chance.
[01:37:12.025 --> 01:37:15.486]  Well, maybe if he had a gun and had some proper training, he could have took out the guy.
[01:37:17.107 --> 01:37:17.447]  Maybe if
[01:37:18.613 --> 01:37:23.955]  More people were out here carrying... Well, these people are communalists, but in a bad way.
[01:37:24.215 --> 01:37:24.975]  They're collectivists.
[01:37:24.995 --> 01:37:34.079]  So, if someone commits a crime with a baseball bat, therefore all baseball bats are bad, they just don't get that if somebody else does something bad, it doesn't mean I lose my freedoms.
[01:37:34.739 --> 01:37:36.080]  Yeah, 11,495 people killed by guns last year.
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:37.480]  34,000... I think 34,500 were killed by motor vehicles.
[01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:38.060]  So, let's ban cars.
[01:37:45.492 --> 01:37:46.932]  Those things seem way more dangerous.
[01:37:46.972 --> 01:37:49.873]  Three times more people are killed by knives than by guns every year.
[01:37:50.353 --> 01:37:52.874]  It's like 500,000 people die from tobacco.
[01:37:52.894 --> 01:37:53.894]  Let's ban cigarettes.
[01:37:53.934 --> 01:37:55.855]  Let's just ban everything.
[01:37:55.895 --> 01:37:57.815]  No one has the freedom to decide what they want to do.
[01:37:58.315 --> 01:38:00.016]  I think campus care is great for a reason.
[01:38:00.256 --> 01:38:05.257]  That doesn't mean that everybody out here is going to be running around with a gun, but there'll be the ability to make that decision.
[01:38:05.297 --> 01:38:06.277]  Hey, I don't feel safe.
[01:38:06.717 --> 01:38:09.438]  I want to make this decision to be able to do it and not be hassled.
[01:38:09.918 --> 01:38:12.479]  Because some people just would rather be prepared than unprepared.
[01:38:12.659 --> 01:38:13.940]  Well Joe, here's the deal.
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:17.122]  We've been on the defensive with gun grabbers for decades.
[01:38:17.162 --> 01:38:18.162]  Now we're on the offense.
[01:38:18.543 --> 01:38:23.186]  All over the country we're getting concealed carry crime drops by 25% on average within two years.
[01:38:23.246 --> 01:38:24.286]  Some areas even lower.
[01:38:24.787 --> 01:38:26.408]  Open carry crime drops even more.
[01:38:26.728 --> 01:38:27.969]  They know we're winning the fight.
[01:38:28.029 --> 01:38:29.089]  They admit we're winning the fight.
[01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:33.792]  So they're turning up the heat and they might pull some other staged events to play the part of victims.
[01:38:34.093 --> 01:38:35.293]  We don't accept their guilt.
[01:38:35.573 --> 01:38:37.615]  We don't accept them guilt slinging at us.
[01:38:37.935 --> 01:38:38.936]  We're not putting up with it.
[01:38:38.976 --> 01:38:39.176]  Joe,
[01:38:39.716 --> 01:38:43.879]  Go get Josh, do some dynamite man-on-the-street interviews with these morons.
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:47.522]  Let's really show people how dumb the anti-gunners are.
[01:38:48.102 --> 01:38:49.223]  Let's really talk to them.
[01:38:49.243 --> 01:38:50.764]  Let's ask them if we should ban cars.
[01:38:50.784 --> 01:38:53.827]  You know, because somebody runs over somebody with a Chevy Silverado.
[01:38:54.247 --> 01:38:56.169]  Is it the fault of all Chevy Silverados?
[01:38:56.589 --> 01:39:02.613]  Well, it's not the fault of the car if you're a transgendered hero like Caitlyn Jenner.
[01:39:02.673 --> 01:39:04.635]  Then you can run over somebody with a car and get away with it.
[01:39:06.374 --> 01:39:07.134]  Then it's okay, then.
[01:39:07.294 --> 01:39:14.517]  Well, I would also ask him about all the anti-free speech movements taking place and, you know, why is it that in North Korea the citizens can't own guns?
[01:39:14.877 --> 01:39:15.657]  Don't they get it?
[01:39:15.917 --> 01:39:19.438]  That human empowerment is about believing in the individual?
[01:39:19.839 --> 01:39:21.739]  Joe Biggs, give us an update next hour.
[01:39:21.799 --> 01:39:22.519]  Thank you so much.
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:24.240]  Jakari's about to be joining you down there.
[01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:25.240]  Thank you.
[01:39:26.781 --> 01:39:28.161]  Okay, I appreciate folks holding.
[01:39:28.201 --> 01:39:29.582]  Let's go to your calls right now.
[01:39:29.602 --> 01:39:32.523]  Let's shift gears back to the international geopolitical stage.
[01:39:33.783 --> 01:39:55.903]  I do not have words to describe, as I have said, the nakedness of the evil with our government for five years funding an Arab Spring to overthrow moderate leaders and then put jihadists in from Saudi Arabia who are allowed to recruit all over the West online and in person to fly to these countries to then be given weapons by the West
[01:39:56.283 --> 01:39:59.385]  To run around blowing up every church they get their filthy hands on.
[01:39:59.705 --> 01:40:02.407]  Blowing up every antiquity they get their filthy hands on.
[01:40:02.867 --> 01:40:04.428]  Murdering non-radical Muslims.
[01:40:04.808 --> 01:40:05.829]  Murdering Shiites.
[01:40:06.169 --> 01:40:07.190]  Murdering Alawites.
[01:40:07.570 --> 01:40:08.510]  Murdering Jews.
[01:40:08.530 --> 01:40:10.332]  Blowing up museums.
[01:40:12.153 --> 01:40:16.295]  In one case, 200 plus men raped a woman until she died.
[01:40:16.695 --> 01:40:18.156]  Chopping women's heads off.
[01:40:18.436 --> 01:40:19.937]  Chopping children's heads off.
[01:40:20.278 --> 01:40:21.999]  Selling children into sex slavery.
[01:40:22.919 --> 01:40:35.203]  I mean, it is just insane, destabilizing everything and saying, well, Iran's our enemy and Russia's our enemy, so we're allowed to start wars on their borders.
[01:40:37.424 --> 01:40:42.506]  Well, Iran isn't trying to take my guns, China isn't trying to take my guns, Russia isn't trying to take my guns.
[01:40:43.887 --> 01:40:45.507]  They're not trying to feed me GMO.
[01:40:46.367 --> 01:40:50.289]  I really don't like to call them Chinese leadership, everybody knows that, but they're not the ones in my backyard.
[01:40:52.062 --> 01:40:54.263]  China is starting to get some media censored in the U.S.
[01:40:54.283 --> 01:40:55.143]  and I've attacked them for it.
[01:40:55.163 --> 01:40:55.683]  But Russia?
[01:40:56.064 --> 01:40:57.644]  Russia's done nothing to me.
[01:40:58.665 --> 01:41:02.006]  And then they put out this weird propaganda almost every week.
[01:41:02.026 --> 01:41:05.988]  They had one in the Houston Chronicle last week that Alex Jones might be a Russian agent.
[01:41:06.028 --> 01:41:06.428]  Yeah.
[01:41:07.348 --> 01:41:09.649]  That's directed, folks, by the White House.
[01:41:10.249 --> 01:41:15.151]  That if you don't want to have war with Russia and you don't want to back Al Qaeda, you must be a Russki agent.
[01:41:16.532 --> 01:41:17.292]  Well, you know, it's funny.
[01:41:17.332 --> 01:41:19.213]  The neocons were actually Trotskyites.
[01:41:20.566 --> 01:41:32.289]  And Stalin arrested a bunch of them, and Leon Trotsky ran to Mexico, and then he got killed down there by an assassin, a Stalin's assassin, with an ice pick, with an ice hatchet.
[01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:42.832]  And then, a couple hundred of his followers, with all the money they'd put in bank accounts in the US and in Brooklyn, ran back to the United States, where they'd come from.
[01:41:44.052 --> 01:41:49.234]  They'd helped start the Bolshevik Revolution, they'd come over from New York City, and now they're the neocon movement in America.
[01:41:50.444 --> 01:41:53.345]  So what's funny is, neocons are claiming I'm a Russian agent.
[01:41:53.705 --> 01:42:07.329]  These people have gone to Russia, overthrown Russia, created modern communism, and then have the nerve to sit here and tell me that I don't want to have nuclear war with Russia, that's not communist now, that I'm some type of evil agent.
[01:42:07.349 --> 01:42:14.611]  I mean, they have the former host of Crossfire, puts out articles every month.
[01:42:16.237 --> 01:42:17.057]  I ought to get him on.
[01:42:17.157 --> 01:42:22.119]  Kincaid, the most bizarre, actually trying to make the case that I'm like KGB, folks.
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:30.002]  And I guarantee you, none of these people making that statement have one-tenth the Americana pedigree I do.
[01:42:30.022 --> 01:42:34.444]  I'm not bragging about it, but it's as Americana as you can get.
[01:42:34.464 --> 01:42:37.265]  It's like a royal flush of Americana.
[01:42:37.645 --> 01:42:40.326]  Both sides of my family, sickeningly Americana.
[01:42:41.411 --> 01:42:43.472]  If there was American royalty, I'd be it, folks.
[01:42:43.872 --> 01:42:44.152]  Okay?
[01:42:44.412 --> 01:42:52.016]  And I sit here and I watch this trash tell me that I'm a Russian agent because I don't want to have a nuclear war.
[01:42:52.276 --> 01:42:55.138]  You people are agents of evil and agents of corruption.
[01:42:55.438 --> 01:42:56.138]  And you know what?
[01:42:56.718 --> 01:42:59.340]  You claim you're taking over the world to spread democracy and freedom?
[01:42:59.660 --> 01:43:05.502]  George Soros trying to teach kids how to be transgender and all this stuff and funding right-wing Nazis in Ukraine?
[01:43:05.743 --> 01:43:07.984]  Well, if that's what America's spreading, I don't want any part of it.
[01:43:08.224 --> 01:43:10.505]  The truth is, this isn't America.
[01:43:10.945 --> 01:43:14.507]  This is a bunch of foreign banks running America into the ground.
[01:43:14.787 --> 01:43:16.648]  We want our coal plants turned back on.
[01:43:16.848 --> 01:43:18.089]  We want our borders controlled.
[01:43:18.269 --> 01:43:19.510]  We want our taxes cut.
[01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:28.935]  We want our private property, and our gun rights, and our parental rights back, and our Bill of Rights, and our Constitution, and the red, white, and blue, and mom and apple pie, and John Wayne, and fast cars.
[01:43:29.275 --> 01:43:30.136]  That's who we are.
[01:43:30.376 --> 01:43:31.416]  We are America.
[01:43:31.637 --> 01:43:32.337]  And any enemy
[01:43:32.537 --> 01:43:40.840]  That tries to sit here and claim that this broadcast, and what we push, isn't 110% red, white, and blue, is a piece of trash filth.
[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:44.881]  And I dare you to say it to my face, because I will hammer your nose into your head.
[01:43:45.601 --> 01:43:50.503]  I am sick of you trash-talking little cowardly people that are selling this country out.
[01:43:51.323 --> 01:43:53.464]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris and then Charlene.
[01:43:53.724 --> 01:43:55.545]  Chris in Indiana, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:43:57.205 --> 01:43:58.066]  I had no problem Alex.
[01:43:58.206 --> 01:44:05.030]  Hey, I woke up this morning and I just got on fire after seeing that traitor John McCain and his Foxville seven minutes of fame.
[01:44:05.531 --> 01:44:07.012]  It just completely set me off.
[01:44:07.412 --> 01:44:15.517]  It reminds me of, you know, I was in Iraq in 2006-2007 during the so-called Civil War and I was over there babysitting.
[01:44:15.757 --> 01:44:20.941]  But, you know, and Bizz can back it up and everything like that too, but I was over in Spiker and I was over in Anaconda.
[01:44:21.421 --> 01:44:22.201]  Excellent film!
[01:44:50.948 --> 01:44:52.529]  It's not like they're overturning some bad guy.
[01:44:52.569 --> 01:44:53.849]  They are putting in Al-Qaeda
[01:45:19.899 --> 01:45:22.973]  In the place of these other people to murder every Christian!
[01:45:23.295 --> 01:45:24.420]  That is a war crime!
[01:45:26.036 --> 01:45:26.456]  Exactly.
[01:45:26.516 --> 01:45:32.459]  It's just like they did with the Muslim Brotherhood, who did the exact same name back in the seventies and eighties in Egypt and everything.
[01:45:32.479 --> 01:45:35.080]  That movie or that documentary just completely outlines.
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:40.903]  And you know, I mean, you know, look, uh, Saddam was trying to put in a gold standard and prioritizes oil.
[01:45:40.923 --> 01:45:43.264]  Well, we can't have that because you don't have Rothschild Bank.
[01:45:43.604 --> 01:45:44.264]  That's right.
[01:45:44.284 --> 01:45:47.626]  Saddam Hussein was from an earlier CIA project of Eisenhower.
[01:45:48.066 --> 01:45:48.967]  He'd been put in power in 79.
[01:45:49.007 --> 01:45:50.847]  He worked for the CIA from 57 on.
[01:45:52.208 --> 01:45:53.529]  He was told to invade Kuwait.
[01:45:53.569 --> 01:45:54.289]  He was set up.
[01:45:54.649 --> 01:45:55.669]  He was a strong man.
[01:45:55.729 --> 01:45:56.690]  He did bad things.
[01:45:57.170 --> 01:46:02.012]  But he was set up by the West and betrayed because he tried to make his people prosperous.
[01:46:02.712 --> 01:46:04.233]  And that's why they did that to Saddam Hussein.
[01:46:04.473 --> 01:46:07.994]  Saddam Hussein was an angel compared to Al Qaeda.
[01:46:09.522 --> 01:46:13.707]  Yeah, it's the same correlation as Hitler, it's just he was the next generation after Hitler.
[01:46:13.947 --> 01:46:23.438]  Because, you know, he was set up with the Nazi party and over in... The West British intelligence set Hitler up as well and had a secret treaty with him and told him to do everything he did and then set him up.
[01:46:23.838 --> 01:46:24.359]  Absolutely.
[01:46:24.779 --> 01:46:26.100]  That's all declassified as well.
[01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:27.121]  God bless you, sir.
[01:46:27.141 --> 01:46:28.121]  I appreciate your call.
[01:46:28.482 --> 01:46:33.685]  Here's the John McCain clip one more time from Fox News saying, give them anti-aircraft missiles.
[01:46:33.705 --> 01:46:35.166]  Yeah, you've already given them anti-tank weapons.
[01:46:35.426 --> 01:46:37.648]  You already gave them anti-aircraft missiles in Benghazi.
[01:46:38.048 --> 01:46:39.729]  So let's give Al-Qaeda the moderates.
[01:46:40.210 --> 01:46:40.870]  That's in Reuters.
[01:46:40.890 --> 01:46:42.732]  They say Al-Qaeda is the moderates.
[01:46:43.492 --> 01:46:45.874]  30 airstrikes by the Russians alone on the Al-Qaeda base.
[01:46:47.213 --> 01:46:50.234]  And our government is criticizing the Russians for bombing Al-Qaeda.
[01:46:50.734 --> 01:46:53.155]  Just take this article and frame it and put it on the wall.
[01:46:53.635 --> 01:47:01.918]  And now you're a Russian agency, all of you listening who don't support Al-Qaeda, you're an anti-American trash, according to the neocons.
[01:47:03.098 --> 01:47:08.480]  You support Al-Qaeda, chopping Christians' heads off, or you're a Russki agent just like me.
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:10.721]  I'm serious, this is how they operate.
[01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:12.261]  Let's go to that clip.
[01:47:12.701 --> 01:47:22.748]  If they're attacking the very guys who we want to see topple Assad, you would let American planes just pass them and let them do that?
[01:47:23.548 --> 01:47:29.573]  No, but I might do what we did in Afghanistan many years ago to give those guys the ability to shoot down those planes.
[01:47:30.033 --> 01:47:32.074]  That equipment is available.
[01:47:33.435 --> 01:47:34.476]  Who would be shooting them down?
[01:47:35.313 --> 01:47:36.273]  The Free Syrian Army.
[01:47:36.673 --> 01:47:44.476]  Just like the Afghans shot down the Russian... No, just like the Russian, the Afghans shot down Russian planes after Russia invaded Afghanistan.
[01:47:44.496 --> 01:47:45.216]  But you hear what I'm saying?
[01:47:45.236 --> 01:47:51.438]  I mean, you can see how easily, as you pointed out to me in prior visits, how easily... Let's go to Charlene in Pennsylvania.
[01:47:51.458 --> 01:47:51.978]  You're on the air.
[01:47:51.998 --> 01:47:52.578]  Thanks for holding.
[01:47:54.571 --> 01:47:54.971]  Hello?
[01:47:54.991 --> 01:47:55.812]  Hi, go ahead.
[01:47:55.852 --> 01:47:56.292]  Hi, Alex.
[01:47:57.653 --> 01:47:59.453]  How about a couple questions?
[01:48:00.054 --> 01:48:07.378]  First, why won't our military go in and arrest Obama for doing all this stuff to our country, killing our people?
[01:48:07.798 --> 01:48:12.040]  Look, he's sending in our troops over into these war zones, and they're being slaughtered.
[01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:14.181]  They can see that he's killing our people.
[01:48:14.341 --> 01:48:25.647]  A military coup, though, even though we have an illegitimate government, an occupational government, the public's not fully educated on that yet, and we would need Congress to call for the President to be indicted, basically.
[01:48:26.348 --> 01:48:43.217]  We would need to move with impeachment, and then if the President did try to block impeachment, then you could have, if you had a good Speaker of the House, you know, direct with the military that the President be put in chains by the Marines, and then brought before the Senate for trial.
[01:48:44.313 --> 01:48:48.896]  So, a military coup is very, very dangerous, and they're still moles.
[01:48:49.076 --> 01:48:52.257]  Even if you get rid of Obama, they've got their operatives everywhere.
[01:48:52.297 --> 01:48:55.239]  So, you'd have to arrest a lot of these new generals they've put in.
[01:48:55.259 --> 01:48:57.000]  You'd have to arrest a bunch of members of Congress.
[01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:00.262]  You'd have to probably arrest about a third of the upper echelon of the government.
[01:49:00.742 --> 01:49:02.803]  So, we're totally infested, ma'am.
[01:49:02.823 --> 01:49:05.464]  I mean, you're not just going to remove Obama and everything gets better.
[01:49:05.484 --> 01:49:06.125]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:49:07.512 --> 01:49:11.315]  Yes, and who's funding these refugees to come over here?
[01:49:11.335 --> 01:49:12.996]  They're not swimming!
[01:49:13.456 --> 01:49:27.166]  Oh no, Obama tells them to come by plane, and they're going to take, it was 10,000 and 300,000, they're now announcing they want to bring in the next two years one million refugees, basically jihadists, who weren't able to overthrow Assad.
[01:49:27.226 --> 01:49:29.388]  So that's their relocation program.
[01:49:29.408 --> 01:49:35.092]  They failed, pouring in from all over the world to defeat Assad and the Russians, and so now they're going to come here.
[01:49:35.672 --> 01:49:36.753]  And then you're going to pay for them.
[01:49:36.973 --> 01:49:37.674]  I'm going to pay for them.
[01:49:38.475 --> 01:49:38.855]  Charlene.
[01:49:38.875 --> 01:49:40.076]  Terrorists can kill us.
[01:49:41.177 --> 01:49:45.461]  And then when they kill you, they'll double Homeland Security's funding and announce it's for gun owners.
[01:49:45.501 --> 01:49:45.701]  Yes.
[01:49:47.363 --> 01:49:47.943]  No, I'm serious.
[01:49:48.063 --> 01:49:51.006]  I mean, they say the number one terror threat is gun owners and veterans.
[01:49:51.847 --> 01:49:53.869]  But our military still won't stop him.
[01:49:54.884 --> 01:49:55.224]  Uh, no.
[01:49:55.385 --> 01:49:58.387]  They've all been listed as terrorists by the criminals.
[01:49:58.667 --> 01:50:06.454]  I mean, when the federal government announces vets are the number one terrorist and are training 24-7 to take guns, you've got a foreign takeover government.
[01:50:06.474 --> 01:50:09.277]  I mean, we have an occupied federal government.
[01:50:09.297 --> 01:50:11.038]  Why won't the Congress do anything?
[01:50:11.098 --> 01:50:12.539]  Why won't the Senate do anything?
[01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:13.881]  Well, it's like Adolf Hitler.
[01:50:14.021 --> 01:50:15.482]  I mean, why doesn't anything to him?
[01:50:15.582 --> 01:50:16.243]  Or Stalin?
[01:50:16.783 --> 01:50:19.526]  I mean, look, a lot of people in the federal... Let's be clear.
[01:50:20.501 --> 01:50:22.483]  I'm not kissing the butt of the feds, it's true.
[01:50:23.024 --> 01:50:29.110]  Per capita, there's probably more awake feds than any other group in government.
[01:50:29.971 --> 01:50:32.054]  I mean, you don't think feds don't know how evil it is?
[01:50:32.414 --> 01:50:37.660]  You know how they're manipulated, how they're watched, how they're persecuted if they don't play ball to be corrupt?
[01:50:38.570 --> 01:50:51.731]  The Feds are incredibly awake, the military is incredibly awake, the police are incredibly awake, even though they do some bad stuff, that's one reason the globalists can't completely move yet, is because, take funding Al-Qaeda, it's now just coming out.
[01:50:52.111 --> 01:50:53.534]  That cripples the globalists.
[01:50:54.687 --> 01:51:00.173]  Because the more talk there is, the more the military notices what's going on, and then the compartmentalization breaks down.
[01:51:00.534 --> 01:51:01.655]  Charlene, thanks for your call.
[01:51:02.096 --> 01:51:08.343]  We're going to come back and talk to Chris in New York City, and then Dustin, Dave, Tanner, and others.
[01:51:10.490 --> 01:51:11.871]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowicz.
[01:51:12.312 --> 01:51:14.274]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[01:51:14.834 --> 01:51:18.498]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing.
[01:51:18.698 --> 01:51:27.186]  Ten years ago, I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[01:51:27.526 --> 01:51:30.789]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[01:51:31.670 --> 01:51:34.751]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S.
[01:51:34.791 --> 01:51:39.413]  passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[01:51:40.174 --> 01:51:44.395]  It was then I formed IDStronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world.
[01:51:45.096 --> 01:51:47.917]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[01:51:48.257 --> 01:51:50.498]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[01:51:51.358 --> 01:51:57.605]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallets, sleeves, or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data.
[01:51:58.366 --> 01:52:03.632]  You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct sales model you won't pay more than other comparable unprotected wallets.
[01:52:03.973 --> 01:52:05.675]  It is as though the protection is free.
[01:52:06.355 --> 01:52:07.997]  Visit idstronghold.com today.
[01:52:09.372 --> 01:52:15.697]  My name is Bill Bunner, and I'm the president of the largest private news and research network in the world.
[01:52:16.098 --> 01:52:21.042]  And I paid for this airtime because I have an important message to the American people.
[01:52:21.582 --> 01:52:25.566]  There's a change coming that the government isn't telling you about.
[01:52:26.106 --> 01:52:29.970]  This change has deep implications for life in America.
[01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:34.654]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect,
[01:52:35.234 --> 01:52:37.996]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[01:52:38.357 --> 01:52:40.579]  Thing is, I was right then, too.
[01:52:41.319 --> 01:52:45.262]  A few years ago, I warned that housing prices would collapse.
[01:52:45.723 --> 01:52:46.223]  They did.
[01:52:46.824 --> 01:52:51.247]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[01:52:51.888 --> 01:52:52.368]  They did.
[01:52:53.049 --> 01:52:56.332]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[01:52:56.892 --> 01:52:58.894]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[01:52:59.274 --> 01:53:00.455]  This will affect us all.
[01:53:00.775 --> 01:53:02.617]  You can watch the video for free right now.
[01:53:02.737 --> 01:53:03.358]  I think so.
[01:53:17.870 --> 01:53:18.590]  We're good to go.
[01:53:38.917 --> 01:53:42.459]  Just recently, we've witnessed some of the most catastrophic disasters in history.
[01:53:42.739 --> 01:53:48.822]  Be sure to prepare yourself with great-tasting, high-quality, GMO-free food that has a 25-year shelf life.

[01:54:34.296 --> 01:54:36.177]  You can't go to MyPatriotSupply's website.
[01:54:36.197 --> 01:54:37.078]  You can't go anywhere else.
[01:54:37.458 --> 01:54:39.339]  You've got to go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:46.883]  InfoWarsSelect.com is a URL that will take you directly to the subpage of InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:54:47.123 --> 01:54:51.585]  That's InfoWarsSelect.com, where you can see their full selection.
[01:54:52.805 --> 01:54:54.868]  At the lowest prices they ever offer.
[01:54:55.389 --> 01:54:57.151]  But that's their normal lowest prices.
[01:54:57.471 --> 01:54:59.734]  And you can buy from them.
[01:55:00.495 --> 01:55:09.888]  Or you can buy InfoWars Select that's the exact same food, made at the exact same time, highest quality, private labeled for InfoWars Select.
[01:55:10.729 --> 01:55:14.273]  And you can get the lowest price they've ever offered in their history to anybody.
[01:55:14.793 --> 01:55:15.714]  I twisted their arm.
[01:55:15.834 --> 01:55:19.138]  I said, I really want to give people the incredibly lowest price.
[01:55:19.658 --> 01:55:20.980]  They gave it to me for two weeks.
[01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:22.401]  They extended it for one week.
[01:55:22.741 --> 01:55:25.664]  That three-week special ends tonight at midnight.
[01:55:26.425 --> 01:55:30.949]  The highest quality storable foods you're going to find, in my view, at the lowest price.
[01:55:31.049 --> 01:55:32.350]  It is extremely affordable.
[01:55:32.990 --> 01:55:35.012]  Everybody should be self-sufficient.
[01:55:35.072 --> 01:55:40.857]  It starts with food, water filtration, things like ProPure G2 at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:55:43.178 --> 01:55:48.563]  You can also call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:55:49.564 --> 01:55:54.508]  And finally, Liver Shield that you can take daily, known herbs that detoxify.
[01:55:55.692 --> 01:56:04.216]  Or, you can do the full detox with the oxy powder, the apple cider vinegar, and the olive oil on the sixth day, and you've heard what people talk about.
[01:56:04.897 --> 01:56:08.378]  You can see the informational videos there at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:56:08.699 --> 01:56:09.259]  It's amazing.
[01:56:09.639 --> 01:56:12.981]  That sold out for three months, then we got a small supply in for one week.
[01:56:13.381 --> 01:56:18.163]  That sold out, we got a big supply in, but as hot as it is, it could be sold out in two weeks.
[01:56:18.604 --> 01:56:21.165]  Believe me, folks, I don't know anybody
[01:56:22.247 --> 01:56:28.515]  Dr. Group knows a few, but I don't know anybody that's not done this and had amazing response.
[01:56:29.897 --> 01:56:32.100]  Now, some people kind of feel sick when they do it, too.
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:34.043]  I mean, I want to warn you, this is not a joke.
[01:56:34.744 --> 01:56:35.745]  X2's not a joke.
[01:56:36.646 --> 01:56:37.727]  Oxy-Powder's not a joke.
[01:56:37.768 --> 01:56:39.129]  I mean, these aren't joke products.
[01:56:39.994 --> 01:56:41.054]  This is not snake oil.
[01:56:41.074 --> 01:56:42.395]  This is the anti-snake oil.
[01:56:42.895 --> 01:56:44.995]  We really set out to have true game changers.
[01:56:45.375 --> 01:56:48.516]  And your purchases make the transmission possible, so it's a win-win.

[01:56:55.417 --> 01:56:57.618]  Chris in New York, thanks for holding.
[01:56:57.638 --> 01:56:58.218]  You're a trooper.
[01:56:58.478 --> 01:56:59.658]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:57:01.719 --> 01:57:02.379]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:57:02.599 --> 01:57:05.659]  Real quick, I'm going to go fast through this.
[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:07.820]  I think it's a shame
[01:57:08.647 --> 01:57:09.667]  That the U.S.
[01:57:09.767 --> 01:57:22.790]  is asking Russia and Putin to actually intervene in Syria, and now they are being slandered for because they, quote-unquote, attacked the wrong person when they all fly in the same flag.
[01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:29.351]  Doesn't matter what name they use, if it's Al-Nusra, Al-Qaeda, ISIS, ISIL, or IS.
[01:57:31.371 --> 01:57:36.212]  Number two, like you said,
[01:57:38.278 --> 01:57:49.062]  Russia and China are not trying to take your guns, or force vaccinate your children, or make you eat GMO food by not labeling.
[01:57:49.582 --> 01:57:53.924]  No, Russian TV says GMO is designed to sterilize you, and that they're giving too many vaccines.
[01:57:53.984 --> 01:57:54.224]  I know.
[01:57:54.384 --> 01:57:56.125]  It's like Russia's turning into InfoWars.
[01:57:58.966 --> 01:58:06.009]  Also, I think it's important that you might want to schedule an interview with Syrian girl with all this that is going on.
[01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:08.630]  We would like to hear her take on this.
[01:58:08.970 --> 01:58:09.470]  Absolutely.
[01:58:09.530 --> 01:58:10.290]  She's a Sunni.
[01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:11.091]  She's a Sunni.
[01:58:11.111 --> 01:58:12.191]  Didn't even like Assad.
[01:58:12.491 --> 01:58:20.615]  Her family are political dissidents that left, but she's against this backing of Al-Qaeda because she understands it's meant to break up Syria and she's a patriot.
[01:58:21.255 --> 01:58:27.986]  So they want to make it a Shiite-Sunni civil war, but most Sunnis are good people and don't want to be part of this as well.
[01:58:28.046 --> 01:58:28.547]  Great points.
[01:58:28.587 --> 01:58:29.027]  Anything else?
[01:58:31.082 --> 01:58:37.708]  Yeah, you mentioned earlier that the ATF was in Texas, I think it was?
[01:58:38.048 --> 01:58:39.469]  Yeah, I just talked to Mike Hanson earlier.
[01:58:39.489 --> 01:58:43.172]  They're just SWAT teaming scores of homes, running around with machine guns.
[01:58:43.432 --> 01:58:46.575]  He says it's basically martial law in his town.
[01:58:46.855 --> 01:58:47.335]  We'll be back.
[01:58:47.355 --> 01:58:47.776]  Stay with us.
[01:58:47.816 --> 01:58:48.737]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:58:49.077 --> 01:58:50.378]  I'm going to go to Dave next.
[01:58:50.418 --> 01:58:52.680]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:53.821]  Dustin and Tanner.
[01:58:54.261 --> 01:58:56.463]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:59.255 --> 01:59:03.361]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[01:59:03.562 --> 01:59:07.768]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[01:59:07.808 --> 01:59:15.119]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[01:59:15.259 --> 01:59:25.782]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[01:59:25.922 --> 01:59:29.263]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[01:59:29.443 --> 01:59:30.463]  What do you have to lose?
[01:59:30.583 --> 01:59:38.865]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[01:59:39.005 --> 01:59:42.207]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[01:59:42.327 --> 01:59:46.330]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[01:59:46.510 --> 01:59:48.632]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[01:59:48.832 --> 01:59:54.956]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:59:55.056 --> 01:59:56.657]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:15.256 --> 02:00:15.896]  Big Brother.
[02:00:16.557 --> 02:00:17.577]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:18.337 --> 02:00:19.418]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:20.098 --> 02:00:20.898]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.678 --> 02:00:22.559]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.219 --> 02:00:26.840]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.401 --> 02:00:31.522]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.163 --> 02:00:36.084]  Joe Skousen, editor of World Affairs Brief, is going to be joining us.
[02:00:36.744 --> 02:00:38.525]  He's very informed geopolitically.
[02:00:39.969 --> 02:00:42.591]  One of the top survivalists in the country.
[02:00:43.492 --> 02:00:48.376]  His views differ from mine, just slightly in interpretation about the three major predator groups.
[02:00:48.756 --> 02:00:51.238]  There have been big developments since he was on with us three months ago.
[02:00:51.638 --> 02:00:52.799]  He's coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:54.201]  We'll continue with your calls.
[02:00:54.221 --> 02:00:56.442]  We also have an update from Joe Biggs at the bottom of the hour.
[02:00:56.843 --> 02:01:03.848]  And Jakari and Joe will be down there in the fourth hour, when Leanne McAdoo is hosting the fourth hour of the wrap-up show, Overdrive.
[02:01:04.229 --> 02:01:06.370]  Whatever you want to call it, it's a jam-packed fourth hour.
[02:01:07.151 --> 02:01:09.273]  Dave in California, thanks for holding your ear on the air.
[02:01:10.526 --> 02:01:12.647]  Brother Alex, long time no talk to you.
[02:01:12.667 --> 02:01:14.347]  Welcome.
[02:01:14.367 --> 02:01:14.767]  Thank you.
[02:01:15.488 --> 02:01:20.109]  I echo the previous caller's request for Syrian Girl Partisan to come on.
[02:01:20.169 --> 02:01:29.052]  I'd like to hear her take and possibly also Mr. Skousen's take on our actual relationship with Israel.
[02:01:29.132 --> 02:01:33.614]  They're not our, technically not our ally, and they're not a member of NATO.
[02:01:33.694 --> 02:01:34.254]  Is that correct?
[02:01:35.097 --> 02:01:39.821]  Well, we have agreements unilaterally with Israel to, quote, defend Israel.
[02:01:40.161 --> 02:01:44.444]  But you're right, they didn't sign any nuclear treaties, chemical weapons treaties, UN treaties.
[02:01:44.504 --> 02:01:45.245]  I think it's smart.
[02:01:45.625 --> 02:01:46.586]  They're like Switzerland.
[02:01:47.026 --> 02:01:48.908]  Israel's like, no, we'll make our own laws.
[02:01:49.288 --> 02:01:50.909]  And people criticize Israel for that.
[02:01:50.949 --> 02:01:53.271]  No, I think we should stay out of everything as well.
[02:01:54.512 --> 02:01:55.373]  I agree with that.
[02:01:57.572 --> 02:02:00.553]  So, technically, you know, Israel could be on their own.
[02:02:00.913 --> 02:02:02.214]  You know, it won't happen.
[02:02:02.854 --> 02:02:05.755]  But, uh... Nobody's gonna attack Israel again.
[02:02:05.995 --> 02:02:11.397]  They got 800 nuclear weapons at least, with high-tech cruise missiles, ICBMs, everything.
[02:02:11.897 --> 02:02:13.718]  It's the end of the world if you attack Israel.
[02:02:14.178 --> 02:02:15.698]  But, I don't know, our government's attacking Russia.
[02:02:16.619 --> 02:02:17.979]  Maybe somebody will attack Israel.
[02:02:18.059 --> 02:02:19.100]  People are so crazy now.
[02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:22.381]  Well, maybe you can get Putin on and ask him.
[02:02:23.817 --> 02:02:25.278]  You know, it's funny you say that.
[02:02:25.578 --> 02:02:28.459]  We've gotten very close to getting Putin on.
[02:02:28.859 --> 02:02:31.620]  The problem is I'd have to get on an airplane and go to Russia to do it.
[02:02:32.441 --> 02:02:34.382]  I can get a sit-down interview probably with Putin.
[02:02:35.242 --> 02:02:38.323]  But, I mean, he's just going to say what he's going to say.
[02:02:38.343 --> 02:02:40.104]  I can sit there and play clips of him already saying it.
[02:02:40.404 --> 02:02:44.086]  It'd be a nice stunt for me to pull, but I could have done an interview with Ahmadinejad.
[02:02:44.126 --> 02:02:45.166]  He wanted me to come interview him.
[02:02:47.127 --> 02:02:49.028]  I'm not going to even say the other people who wanted me to come interview him.
[02:02:49.468 --> 02:02:51.449]  It sounds insane, but anyways, go ahead.
[02:02:52.432 --> 02:02:53.513]  Okay, Rod, that was it.
[02:02:53.533 --> 02:02:54.674]  It's good talking to you again.
[02:02:54.714 --> 02:02:55.715]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[02:02:55.755 --> 02:02:56.856]  We appreciate you calling in.
[02:02:56.876 --> 02:02:57.997]  Let's go ahead.
[02:02:58.538 --> 02:03:00.880]  All I know is I just keep... I got up at 6 a.m.
[02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:04.463]  this morning, and I went and turned on the computer, and I knew they were landing Chinese troops.
[02:03:04.523 --> 02:03:06.165]  I knew they were moving in Iranian troops.
[02:03:06.245 --> 02:03:10.729]  I knew they put 50 MiGs on the ground and a whole bunch of other helicopters.
[02:03:11.110 --> 02:03:13.111]  I mean, this is a full-scale invasion.
[02:03:14.032 --> 02:03:15.814]  counter-invasion to the Al-Qaeda forces.
[02:03:16.254 --> 02:03:17.635]  Then they blew up the Al-Qaeda base.
[02:03:17.675 --> 02:03:18.436]  They didn't play games.
[02:03:18.696 --> 02:03:21.098]  The Russians have intelligence on the ground.
[02:03:21.118 --> 02:03:22.779]  They know exactly who's pulling the strings.
[02:03:23.139 --> 02:03:26.822]  And I bet you money, I bet you money, U.S.
[02:03:26.842 --> 02:03:36.710]  State Department and CIA and NATO and Israeli and Saudi Arabian and Turks died today when the Russians blew up a whole bunch of facilities full of Al-Qaeda.
[02:03:36.730 --> 02:03:39.111]  I mean, they blew up the Al-Qaeda base.
[02:03:39.131 --> 02:03:40.372]  They could just sit there and operate.
[02:03:47.045 --> 02:03:47.746]  That's just incredible.
[02:03:48.528 --> 02:03:50.631]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dustin in California.
[02:03:50.671 --> 02:03:51.032]  Go ahead.
[02:03:51.052 --> 02:03:53.756]  Hey Alex.
[02:03:54.077 --> 02:04:00.788]  I was just calling because I got my Hillary for Prison shirt and I wore it and I went into this neighborhood market called Sprouts.
[02:04:01.724 --> 02:04:06.646]  This old man was like, shame on you, shame on you, how could you, how could you want to send a woman to prison?
[02:04:07.827 --> 02:04:16.411]  Oh, see, you're anti-feminist, exactly, and if you're against abortion, or partial birth abortion, you're now against women, according to the head of Planned Parenthood.
[02:04:16.631 --> 02:04:18.292]  That's all they've got, they're not intellectuals.
[02:04:18.632 --> 02:04:20.633]  Of course, Sprouts is pretty socialist, so what do you expect?
[02:04:21.894 --> 02:04:22.114]  Yeah.
[02:04:22.494 --> 02:04:26.857]  Well, that's why I wore the shirt there, because I wanted to get some feedback and see what people would say.
[02:04:26.877 --> 02:04:28.738]  It was just perfect to have someone say that.
[02:04:29.138 --> 02:04:30.038]  Like, that's his argument.
[02:04:30.238 --> 02:04:34.460]  Oh, you want to send a woman to prison when it's like... No, yeah, why don't you stop picking on a woman?
[02:04:34.721 --> 02:04:36.281]  Let her commit all the crimes she wants.
[02:04:36.702 --> 02:04:37.642]  We're the intellectuals.
[02:04:37.662 --> 02:04:39.623]  We know how to say sexist, racist, homophobe.
[02:04:39.803 --> 02:04:40.344]  Three words.
[02:04:40.384 --> 02:04:40.944]  We're the boss.
[02:04:44.145 --> 02:04:45.546]  Yeah, I just thought I'd call and say that.
[02:04:45.626 --> 02:04:46.467]  God bless you, brother.
[02:04:46.967 --> 02:04:48.288]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:04:48.728 --> 02:04:50.829]  Well, I just got the X2 on my birthday.
[02:04:51.377 --> 02:04:56.179]  That was when you did the 28-hour broadcast, and man, it's been definitely a game-changer.
[02:04:57.379 --> 02:04:58.140]  Well, thank you, brother.
[02:04:58.160 --> 02:04:59.540]  Thank you so much for the support.
[02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:00.801]  We're gonna go to break.
[02:05:00.821 --> 02:05:01.501]  We're gonna come back.
[02:05:01.761 --> 02:05:02.962]  We got Joel Skousen joining us.
[02:05:02.982 --> 02:05:04.142]  We'll get to your calls as well.
[02:05:04.422 --> 02:05:05.583]  Joe Biggs is gonna pop in.
[02:05:05.623 --> 02:05:06.043]  Stay with us.
[02:05:09.110 --> 02:05:12.933]  Just when you think the government couldn't get any more ludicrous, the U.S.
[02:05:12.993 --> 02:05:20.698]  Environmental Protection Agency has taken to social media to point out the harmful effects of sunny days on plant life.
[02:05:20.898 --> 02:05:21.439]  That's right.
[02:05:21.619 --> 02:05:24.721]  The agency tweeted, Think sunny days are good for plants?
[02:05:25.021 --> 02:05:25.681]  Not always.
[02:05:25.962 --> 02:05:30.505]  Sunlight causes ozone to form, which harms foliage and weakens trees.
[02:05:30.965 --> 02:05:36.949]  Makes you wonder how did the planet survive for millennia before a big bloated government came along to protect it?
[02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:48.278]  Let's just point out the absurdity of the EPA highlighting the alleged danger of sunlight as the world is facing numerous legitimate environmental issues, some of which have been caused by the agency itself.
[02:05:48.478 --> 02:05:57.945]  Let's not forget this is the same agency that polluted the Animas River with more than 3 million gallons of toxic waste last month in an effort to cover up that disaster.
[02:05:58.405 --> 02:06:02.508]  EPA officials refused to provide data to the press on the extent of the damage.
[02:06:02.828 --> 02:06:08.572]  Read the article, Obama's EPA warns sunlight dangerous to plants at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:09.033 --> 02:06:13.976]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:06:14.176 --> 02:06:20.059]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:06:20.299 --> 02:06:24.882]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:06:25.082 --> 02:06:28.404]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:06:28.644 --> 02:06:30.225]  No needles, no injections.
[02:06:30.625 --> 02:06:35.747]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:06:38.889 --> 02:06:39.830]  BrainForce is here.
[02:06:40.010 --> 02:06:42.111]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:06:42.231 --> 02:06:46.953]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:06:47.213 --> 02:06:50.355]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:06:50.495 --> 02:06:53.717]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:06:53.977 --> 02:06:55.798]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:06:55.958 --> 02:06:59.960]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean.
[02:07:00.080 --> 02:07:05.663]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:07:08.604 --> 02:07:09.164]  I want more candy!
[02:07:09.184 --> 02:07:10.465]  I want more video games!
[02:07:10.525 --> 02:07:10.705]  Mine!
[02:07:11.046 --> 02:07:11.126]  Mine!
[02:07:11.306 --> 02:07:11.906]  Mine!
[02:07:38.604 --> 02:07:39.364]  I think so.
[02:08:12.589 --> 02:08:12.909]  USA!
[02:08:13.870 --> 02:08:14.150]  USA!
[02:08:15.191 --> 02:08:15.471]  USA!
[02:08:16.452 --> 02:08:16.592]  USA!
[02:08:17.753 --> 02:08:17.973]  USA!
[02:08:19.114 --> 02:08:24.577]  If you let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[02:08:25.298 --> 02:08:29.761]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[02:08:30.301 --> 02:08:34.324]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life.
[02:08:35.145 --> 02:08:36.445]  It's not about food.
[02:08:37.146 --> 02:08:39.267]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:48.101]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:48.542 --> 02:08:51.544]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:08:53.786 --> 02:08:58.009]  Well, they're saying Obama is an idiot and Putin's made him look like a fool in the news.
[02:08:59.850 --> 02:09:02.812]  I have studied modern history, ancient history.
[02:09:02.852 --> 02:09:04.994]  I've studied the current players as much as I can.
[02:09:05.014 --> 02:09:12.940]  And I would say I'm still just moderately informed because the world is such a deep, complex political system.
[02:09:14.309 --> 02:09:24.444]  But I know this, the West has been funding radical Islamists to destabilize the Middle East and also be blowback in the West so they can take more liberties in the name of fighting jihad terror.
[02:09:26.989 --> 02:09:31.730]  And I know that certainly George Soros brags that he helped destabilize Ukraine.
[02:09:31.790 --> 02:09:33.070]  I know both sides have beefs.
[02:09:33.590 --> 02:09:35.710]  Western Ukrainians have been persecuted by the Russians.
[02:09:36.251 --> 02:09:39.891]  The Russians have been persecuted during World War II, back from the Nazis.
[02:09:40.451 --> 02:09:42.072]  So nobody's perfect in all this.
[02:09:42.172 --> 02:09:50.753]  And I wanted to get Joel Skousen on because, you know, he's a former Marine Corps officer, fighter-bomber pilot, Vietnam, so he can speak to the bombing raids.
[02:09:51.773 --> 02:09:56.214]  He has World Affairs brief that's really accurate, long-term, predicting different developments.
[02:09:57.441 --> 02:10:00.663]  He's also one of the top strategic retreat builders in the country.
[02:10:00.683 --> 02:10:10.869]  I made a film with him, Strategic Relocation, the film that goes with his full-color book that has just some of the most accurate global information about safest countries, regions.
[02:10:11.209 --> 02:10:11.750]  We sell it.
[02:10:12.050 --> 02:10:13.571]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:10:15.292 --> 02:10:16.092]  But he differs a bit.
[02:10:16.112 --> 02:10:20.395]  I mean, he talks about the three power groups, the Anglo-American establishment, the Russians, and the Chinese.
[02:10:20.435 --> 02:10:21.956]  Well, I agree those are the three predator groups.
[02:10:22.436 --> 02:10:23.677]  Both countries are run by
[02:10:24.841 --> 02:10:27.304]  Very corrupt Machiavellian groups.
[02:10:28.545 --> 02:10:32.049]  We also agree the Anglo-American establishment dominates the New World Order.
[02:10:32.269 --> 02:10:34.973]  It's the main group, but it doesn't fully control the other two.
[02:10:35.333 --> 02:10:36.474]  But they all overlap.
[02:10:37.816 --> 02:10:40.178]  But the wild card is radical Islam.
[02:10:41.013 --> 02:10:47.599]  And it predominantly is controlled by British intelligence, Anglo-American establishment, and the Israelis, the Turks, and others.
[02:10:48.059 --> 02:10:55.746]  And you can see them all full court press trying to bring down Syria in the proxy war, just like they've been doing in Ukraine.
[02:10:55.866 --> 02:10:58.769]  So I don't see how the two aren't inexorably linked.
[02:11:00.009 --> 02:11:11.856]  Showing that both are a Western Anglo-American offensive because Skousen believes that it was a staged takedown coup to make it look illegitimate so Putin had an excuse to come into Crimea.
[02:11:12.336 --> 02:11:16.298]  Well, he already controlled Crimea and the gas pipeline so what is the point of that?
[02:11:16.318 --> 02:11:19.440]  I'm not disagreeing with Skousen, I just don't see
[02:11:20.731 --> 02:11:22.053]  The preponderance of proof.
[02:11:22.153 --> 02:11:23.174]  I see some proof there.
[02:11:23.855 --> 02:11:32.586]  But regardless, Putin didn't try to take my guns, Putin didn't try to forcibly inoculate me, Putin didn't try to put in transgender bathrooms, he's doing the opposite in Russia.
[02:11:33.327 --> 02:11:39.034]  So whether they've adopted quote conspiracy culture because it sells with the public because it's accurate,
[02:11:39.594 --> 02:11:40.995]  Or maybe they're being converted.
[02:11:41.095 --> 02:11:42.695]  I know he met with Sholts and Eatson a lot.
[02:11:43.035 --> 02:11:44.236]  I don't lionize Putin.
[02:11:44.716 --> 02:11:47.397]  I know Sholts and Eatson basically broke a bunch of stuff down to Putin.
[02:11:47.797 --> 02:11:53.039]  I know that in the whole Russian hierarchy, a lot of the shows on TV now sound like this one over there.
[02:11:53.599 --> 02:11:56.200]  So there's a lot of weird stuff going on.
[02:11:56.520 --> 02:11:58.401]  You add to that Russian airstrikes, at least 30.
[02:12:00.006 --> 02:12:05.350]  Against al-Nusra, which they admit is, quoted, Al-Qaeda, Syrian branch, that's Reuters today.
[02:12:06.090 --> 02:12:11.954]  I just read from Reuters, in the article headlined, Russian warplanes targeting insurgents in Syria, but not Islamic State.
[02:12:11.974 --> 02:12:13.735]  Well, that's the command and control.
[02:12:14.176 --> 02:12:19.459]  Then IS is just their field troops setting up a new country, taking part of Syria and Iraq.
[02:12:19.499 --> 02:12:21.761]  So, there's my analysis, there's my breakdown.
[02:12:22.521 --> 02:12:24.883]  And I want to hear Joel Skousen from his view.
[02:12:25.143 --> 02:12:31.969]  Chinese troops landing, tanks, helicopters, jets, at least 50 MiGs, more tanks, more helicopters.
[02:12:32.450 --> 02:12:34.792]  Is Russia being sucked into a new Afghanistan?
[02:12:35.272 --> 02:12:36.753]  McCain seemed very pleased.
[02:12:36.773 --> 02:12:38.235]  He said this is a new Afghanistan.
[02:12:38.535 --> 02:12:41.497]  We'll give them missiles now to shoot down the Russian aircraft.
[02:12:42.478 --> 02:12:42.759]  Is it a...
[02:12:43.951 --> 02:12:46.813]  Is it a failure by Obama or is it a globalist triumph?
[02:12:47.293 --> 02:12:51.575]  What is the larger plan that could bring in a one-world government out of this?
[02:12:51.896 --> 02:12:55.418]  Kissinger claims it's a disaster and is now criticizing Obama.
[02:12:55.798 --> 02:12:59.240]  Is that a front or what do you think's behind that?
[02:12:59.260 --> 02:13:01.681]  I mean, I know I've thrown out 30 or 40 things here, Joel.
[02:13:01.921 --> 02:13:09.586]  This is incredibly complex, so I hope you can give us some perspective here, hopefully, so that we can try to decipher what's going on.
[02:13:11.104 --> 02:13:11.864]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[02:13:12.044 --> 02:13:13.925]  It is really complex.
[02:13:14.545 --> 02:13:32.652]  Let me just try to say in general, the important thing for people to realize is that Syria has been the target of the Anglo-American globalists for about three years now, ever since Israel said, look, you guys want us to attack Iran, take down their nuclear program and start a Middle East war.
[02:13:33.132 --> 02:13:35.694]  We don't want to do that until you take down Syria.
[02:13:36.095 --> 02:13:38.517]  Because Syria's got all these missiles and chemical weapons.
[02:13:38.917 --> 02:13:42.960]  They could obliterate Tel Aviv and overwhelm our Iron Dome system.
[02:13:43.441 --> 02:13:44.001]  So the U.S.
[02:13:44.041 --> 02:13:44.742]  agreed to that.
[02:13:45.403 --> 02:13:47.424]  And that's why they started this no-fly zone.
[02:13:48.425 --> 02:13:55.054]  Proposal as in Libya or Syria, and you know that that no fly zone meant much more than just a no fly zone.
[02:13:55.574 --> 02:14:03.404]  It actually was an offensive that went through to take down the Libyan military and infrastructure to make sure they lost the war.
[02:14:04.085 --> 02:14:05.306]  That's what they're going to do in Syria.
[02:14:05.326 --> 02:14:13.130]  And then Kerry made that faux pas there in the London press conference when the reporter asked, is there any way that Syria can avoid this?
[02:14:13.210 --> 02:14:15.491]  And he said, yeah, they could give up their chemical weapons.
[02:14:15.571 --> 02:14:17.252]  And Syria said, we accept.
[02:14:17.312 --> 02:14:18.692]  And the Russians said, we accept.
[02:14:18.773 --> 02:14:23.235]  And all of a sudden, the globalist agenda to take down Syria was put on its back.
[02:14:23.795 --> 02:14:24.995]  Now that's why the U.S.
[02:14:25.055 --> 02:14:27.096]  and British intelligence created ISIS.
[02:14:27.176 --> 02:14:37.239]  They basically took about half the Syrian rebels that they've been funding through Qatar and Saudi Arabia and Bahrain and they said, you're going to be ISIS now.
[02:14:37.299 --> 02:14:39.099]  They set up training camps in Jordan.
[02:14:39.119 --> 02:14:44.021]  They put Israeli special Arab agents in to direct them.
[02:14:45.041 --> 02:14:47.482]  And so started this phony war on ISIS.
[02:14:47.943 --> 02:14:58.148]  Basically a backdoor excuse to get back into Syria because the chemical weapons agreement with Syria prohibited US, or at least stopped them diplomatically from going forward.
[02:14:58.448 --> 02:15:00.750]  So ISIS now gave them a new excuse to get back.
[02:15:01.827 --> 02:15:09.938]  And, you know, Russia had to know that this was a U.S.-British intelligence coup to create ISIS as an issue.
[02:15:09.978 --> 02:15:13.302]  But it's interesting that Russia did not blow the whistle on that.
[02:15:13.362 --> 02:15:16.767]  They still are playing the terrorist card, just like the U.S.
[02:15:16.947 --> 02:15:18.729]  did, because that eventually gives them
[02:15:21.844 --> 02:15:32.487]  Reasons to go forward against the war on terror and plus the fact that probably Americans would not accept the fact that the Russians came out and said this was the US British intelligence creation, ISIS.
[02:15:33.407 --> 02:15:45.070]  Though Putin in his main statement, you're right Joel, plays the whole terror card, but in statements last year at the Olympics and then in his new UN speech, which we have an accurate translation of, he did go further towards that.
[02:15:45.110 --> 02:15:49.791]  He actually said in the speech at the Olympics a year ago, he said
[02:15:50.973 --> 02:15:54.201]  Obama has armed ISIS and they're behind ISIS.
[02:15:55.899 --> 02:15:57.700]  Well, I wasn't aware of that, but that is strange.
[02:15:57.720 --> 02:16:00.322]  You notice that the media didn't, of course, give any play to that.
[02:16:01.782 --> 02:16:07.606]  If they had, I doubt that, you know, the Americans probably would have believed it coming from Russia.
[02:16:08.707 --> 02:16:18.993]  You know, they're starting to believe it coming from you and me and other credible sources on the Internet documenting that this is a U.S.-British intelligence creation.
[02:16:19.153 --> 02:16:20.413]  What is this new exhalation?
[02:16:21.897 --> 02:16:28.009]  I know I interrupted you and broke your train of thought, but what does this new big escalation by the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians mean?
[02:16:28.429 --> 02:16:30.032]  Are they walking into a trap?
[02:16:31.932 --> 02:16:33.352]  No, they're not walking into a trap.
[02:16:33.412 --> 02:16:37.554]  In fact, this is a major game changer for the globalist agenda in Syria.
[02:16:37.674 --> 02:16:40.635]  It stops it dead in its tracks for a couple of reasons.
[02:16:40.835 --> 02:16:44.196]  One, Putin suddenly has the high ground of leadership here.
[02:16:44.656 --> 02:16:48.337]  He's going to show that Obama's war on terror was a fraud.
[02:16:48.677 --> 02:16:52.378]  He's going to show that real effective airstrikes are going to take down ISIS.
[02:16:52.719 --> 02:16:55.539]  But you can't take down ISIS without ground troops.
[02:16:55.579 --> 02:16:57.120]  Now, that would be a trap for Russia.
[02:16:57.580 --> 02:16:59.943]  They don't want to get involved in another Afghanistan.
[02:17:00.904 --> 02:17:10.757]  I have to laugh at John McCain, the extreme neocon, trying to say we're going to treat Russia's interference here as if it's the same interference in Afghanistan.
[02:17:10.837 --> 02:17:11.358]  It is not.
[02:17:13.001 --> 02:17:17.405]  Uh, but the ground troops are going to be provided by not by Chinese.
[02:17:17.585 --> 02:17:23.151]  In fact, you know, the stories about a lot of Chinese equipment coming in really have not been confirmed yet.
[02:17:24.192 --> 02:17:29.577]  What has been confirmed is the presence of revolutionary guards from Iran and Hezbollah troops.
[02:17:30.117 --> 02:17:31.539]  They're going to be the shock troops.
[02:17:32.159 --> 02:17:35.822]  Russia's going to provide the air power and I think they're going to go and take down ISIS.
[02:17:35.862 --> 02:17:50.173]  Now, this is going to be a major game changer because if Syria doesn't get taken down, that means that the entire agenda of taking down Iran, and as I've explained in your show before, this nuclear agreement with Iran is just a fraud.
[02:17:50.573 --> 02:17:51.494]  It's just a setup.
[02:17:52.514 --> 02:17:59.959]  Including many elements that guarantee that Iran will eventually have to violate that agreement and give the excuse for the U.S.
[02:17:59.979 --> 02:18:02.881]  to go back and attack Iran using Israel.
[02:18:02.921 --> 02:18:06.123]  But this puts that whole timetable into limbo.
[02:18:06.523 --> 02:18:09.985]  And I think this is a real defeat for globalists.
[02:18:10.085 --> 02:18:18.030]  It shows that Russia has the capability of stopping it without a lot of cost to itself.
[02:18:18.470 --> 02:18:19.871]  I'm surprised they didn't do it earlier.
[02:18:23.945 --> 02:18:25.586]  I just marvel at this.
[02:18:25.666 --> 02:18:36.952]  So, in your view, and I agree with you, Putin is completely gaming Obama, and so it's really unprecedented to have these op-ed pieces written by Henry Kissinger criticizing Obama.
[02:18:37.493 --> 02:18:46.198]  When Obama was first elected, Kissinger took to CNBC to say, he's my protege, he's the greatest weapon we've ever had for the New World Order.
[02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:49.371]  He's going to bring in the New World Order?
[02:18:49.691 --> 02:18:54.374]  I mean, they acted like he was the golden child, the messiah of world government.
[02:18:54.775 --> 02:18:58.878]  And now, what does it signify to have Kissinger dissing himself from Obama?
[02:19:00.259 --> 02:19:07.465]  Well, what it signifies is that he's realizing and admitting that the globalists are stymied.
[02:19:07.745 --> 02:19:09.606]  Now remember, this is not Obama's plan.
[02:19:09.666 --> 02:19:12.329]  Obama is not the genius behind the New World Order.
[02:19:12.349 --> 02:19:13.189]  Sure, he's the figurehead, though.
[02:19:13.469 --> 02:19:14.310]  He's the figurehead.
[02:19:14.350 --> 02:19:15.171]  He's the front man.
[02:19:15.591 --> 02:19:16.212]  But believe me,
[02:19:16.812 --> 02:19:18.893]  I mean, the Russians have let the U.S.
[02:19:18.973 --> 02:19:27.177]  get away with this globalist agenda here in Syria now for many years, and suddenly, I think they were caught completely off guard.
[02:19:27.838 --> 02:19:29.939]  They didn't think the Russians were going to do this.
[02:19:30.019 --> 02:19:36.302]  They put up a lot of hype about how they were going to make things worse, how there was going to be military conflict.
[02:19:36.822 --> 02:19:45.587]  And now, with the Russians doing and attacking al-Nusra, as well as other rebel groups friendly, supposedly, to the U.S.
[02:19:45.647 --> 02:19:46.027]  agenda,
[02:19:46.988 --> 02:19:48.149]  They're going to force the U.S.
[02:19:48.189 --> 02:19:52.333]  to say, all right, we're going to have to coordinate, meaning we want to control where you strike.
[02:19:52.393 --> 02:19:54.014]  And Russia is not going to go along with that.
[02:19:54.074 --> 02:20:01.580]  I think Russia is taking direct coordination from the Syrians to say, these are the targets that are the greatest danger to us.
[02:20:01.961 --> 02:20:03.202]  We need you to go after those.
[02:20:03.242 --> 02:20:04.243]  The Russians are doing it.
[02:20:04.663 --> 02:20:05.564]  And I don't think the U.S.
[02:20:05.624 --> 02:20:06.665]  is going to be able to stop it.
[02:20:07.662 --> 02:20:11.867]  They really don't have any power at all to say to the Russians, you don't have any right here.
[02:20:11.947 --> 02:20:15.952]  In fact, Lavrov, Foreign Minister, made the point that the U.S.
[02:20:15.992 --> 02:20:21.318]  intervention in Syria is not authorized by any Security Council or U.N.
[02:20:21.338 --> 02:20:25.383]  agreement, and that the Russians is, because they've got the permission of the head of state.
[02:20:26.204 --> 02:20:32.447]  And Putin made a great point in his speech that we need to re-establish governments here to stop all these refugees from leaving.
[02:20:32.487 --> 02:20:33.508]  We need order here.
[02:20:34.008 --> 02:20:37.930]  And we're intent on providing order and you should be providing order in Libya.
[02:20:38.710 --> 02:20:41.732]  So he's taken the leadership high ground here to be sure.
[02:20:44.933 --> 02:20:45.974]  This is stunning.
[02:20:46.314 --> 02:20:48.195]  What are the larger ramifications?
[02:20:48.875 --> 02:20:51.977]  What are the ripple effects of this in your view, Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief?
[02:20:53.159 --> 02:20:58.363]  The larger ramifications is the globalists have to regroup and I suspect they're going to use Israel.
[02:20:59.584 --> 02:21:04.188]  There are rumors coming out of Israel now that they're planning an attack on Syria.
[02:21:04.408 --> 02:21:10.692]  This could be a game changer for Israel to go in and start to destabilize on another front.
[02:21:11.813 --> 02:21:16.337]  And I'm not sure the Russians want to tangle with the Israelis.
[02:21:16.357 --> 02:21:21.781]  They would certainly have to get a higher class of air force in there to take on the
[02:21:22.925 --> 02:21:26.043]  Sure, this is starting to sound like revelations here.
[02:21:27.725 --> 02:21:37.950]  Well, certainly it may be a little early for that apocalyptic ending, but I can tell you that the globalists are right now meeting as we speak and trying to figure out how do we stop this.
[02:21:38.931 --> 02:21:42.053]  You know, this stymies our entire agenda here.
[02:21:42.473 --> 02:21:48.876]  But don't the Russians seem particularly historically slow to move, but once they move they usually don't back down easily?
[02:21:48.896 --> 02:21:55.940]  I mean, could Israel bite off more than they can chew and not have the American people's support when they see Russia taking out Al-Qaeda?
[02:21:57.455 --> 02:22:04.919]  Yes, if Russia certainly is able to really start to take out this terrorist, I mean, literally, they're going to be put in the hero category.
[02:22:04.959 --> 02:22:06.299]  Now, I'm not a fan of Russia.
[02:22:06.359 --> 02:22:14.844]  I know that eventually they're attempting to strike the West, but I can't help but clap my hands in glee that they're thwarting the globalist agenda.
[02:22:15.204 --> 02:22:17.145]  And I'm surprised they didn't do this earlier.
[02:22:18.486 --> 02:22:28.656]  They are very cautious because at the same time that they're building up a great deal of weapons of mass destruction preparing for World War III, they've decided to throw a monkey wrench in a globalist agenda in the Middle East.
[02:22:29.137 --> 02:22:35.063]  And may I remind you, I have always long maintained that Russia would not
[02:22:36.189 --> 02:22:40.774]  Stop Syria from being taken down if the globals really went after it.
[02:22:40.854 --> 02:22:42.115]  But I was wrong.
[02:22:42.175 --> 02:22:42.876]  They have here.
[02:22:43.417 --> 02:22:48.942]  But only because they decided it would not lead to a direct confrontation militarily with the West.
[02:22:49.403 --> 02:22:53.067]  They know that the West is in a bad position, having created a terrorist group.
[02:22:53.687 --> 02:22:55.028]  And they're stuck.
[02:22:55.568 --> 02:22:57.709]  They can't really come out and defend ISIS.
[02:22:57.729 --> 02:22:59.690]  They've got to let Russia have their way.
[02:22:59.750 --> 02:23:01.150]  So it's kind of a different game.
[02:23:01.170 --> 02:23:03.731]  It's not really... Let's give credit where credit's due.
[02:23:03.771 --> 02:23:09.994]  I don't like giving myself this credit, or you the credit, Joel, or Colonel Schaefer the credit, and a handful of other folks.
[02:23:10.554 --> 02:23:17.417]  In the last five years with Libya and now Syria, we've laid out exactly what was happening, exactly what happened at Benghazi.
[02:23:17.717 --> 02:23:19.378]  I've had major whistleblowers on.
[02:23:19.958 --> 02:23:21.679]  I've now confirmed again yesterday
[02:23:22.279 --> 02:23:29.564]  That I mean, I've directly proven it now that the feds are crawling all over me because and I was told it's because of Benghazi.
[02:23:29.644 --> 02:23:35.148]  I now know what it is and it's the fact that we are actively exposing this.
[02:23:35.228 --> 02:23:38.670]  The military already knew this, but it gave them a sounding board.
[02:23:39.471 --> 02:23:51.636]  Three years ago, two and a half years ago, thousands of non-commissioned officers, some commissioned officers, put out the pieces of paper on Twitter and Facebook saying, I won't be the Air Force for Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[02:23:52.497 --> 02:24:04.022]  We know that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at midnight, the night before airstrikes were to begin in the no-fly zone in Syria, General Dempsey then, head of the Joint Chiefs, went to Obama and said, you cannot do this.
[02:24:04.342 --> 02:24:05.062]  He backed off.
[02:24:05.142 --> 02:24:06.383]  That was later admitted.
[02:24:07.262 --> 02:24:18.325]  And the fact that alternative patriot media exposed that we were doing this evil thing in Syria, our military had a close to rebellion level event of just free speech.
[02:24:18.805 --> 02:24:20.305]  That caused the globalists to blink.
[02:24:20.385 --> 02:24:22.726]  Kerry's screw-ups caused them to blink.
[02:24:23.226 --> 02:24:33.809]  And now that gave Russia the chance, repeating basically domestic info we're putting out and others, to then put the globalists in check in Syria.
[02:24:34.169 --> 02:24:34.989]  And the establishment
[02:24:35.089 --> 02:24:42.740]  realizes that this show and others has a direct communication with the US military and it's really scaring the establishment right now.
[02:24:44.039 --> 02:24:48.141]  Yeah, we've had a rebellion within the Navy pilot ranks, of which I was a member.
[02:24:49.101 --> 02:24:54.943]  Boy, the story about them trying to get permission to hit high-value targets and them taking an hour.
[02:24:55.664 --> 02:24:59.345]  They were bingo fuel, meaning they got to go back to the ship before they could attack.
[02:24:59.405 --> 02:25:01.366]  I mean, this happened time and again.
[02:25:01.386 --> 02:25:05.928]  The Navy pilots realized, hey, this war is being sabotaged just like it was for us in Vietnam.
[02:25:07.185 --> 02:25:14.389]  Go over that a little bit, because we know the Iraqi government's proven, others have, that our military's not allowed to target ISIS or any of these other scumbags.
[02:25:14.810 --> 02:25:19.392]  And again, that's what we've had the former head of Defense Intelligence go public and say.
[02:25:19.432 --> 02:25:21.214]  No, we were ordered to back al-Qaeda.
[02:25:21.434 --> 02:25:22.594]  We were ordered to back ISIS.
[02:25:22.634 --> 02:25:23.675]  This was a conscious order.
[02:25:23.975 --> 02:25:27.237]  We have the deputy director of the CIA going public two weeks ago.
[02:25:27.597 --> 02:25:33.181]  Are they covering their butts, or are they openly rebelling against this tyranny?
[02:25:34.363 --> 02:25:35.844]  They're not really opening a rebellion.
[02:25:35.884 --> 02:25:37.425]  You can't do that in the military.
[02:25:37.465 --> 02:25:38.646]  The military is ruthless.
[02:25:40.107 --> 02:25:44.391]  It's filled with higher-level yesmanship at the highest level of generals and admirals.
[02:25:44.831 --> 02:25:48.894]  They will crucify any officer that really tries to do a rebellion.
[02:25:49.375 --> 02:25:55.920]  But that isn't stopping people from leaking through the alternative media the stories we had from Navy pilots saying, you know, they were being
[02:25:56.500 --> 02:26:00.601]  Well, I agree with you, but I'm saying this is as close as you get to that right now.
[02:26:12.375 --> 02:26:13.396]  Yes, right.
[02:26:13.676 --> 02:26:14.716]  It's as good as they come.
[02:26:14.816 --> 02:26:26.822]  And the leaking war is a very effective war because the alternative media is big enough, the stories do get out, and these people are having to react to this.
[02:26:27.202 --> 02:26:29.444]  So I think the globalists are in a major quandary.
[02:26:29.904 --> 02:26:33.926]  Their entire agenda for the Middle East is on the rocks right now.
[02:26:34.106 --> 02:26:36.867]  They're going to have to establish some new way of
[02:26:38.188 --> 02:26:39.729]  I'm getting rid of Syria.
[02:26:39.769 --> 02:26:41.589]  And of course, Syria was headed to be a disaster.
[02:26:41.609 --> 02:26:44.310]  If you let ISIS take over the Yihadists, it would be a bloodbath.
[02:26:44.810 --> 02:26:45.770]  It would be forever.
[02:26:46.171 --> 02:26:46.971]  I mean, just like Libya.
[02:26:47.071 --> 02:26:50.492]  Libya is not stable to this day, and that shows no sign of stability.
[02:26:50.652 --> 02:26:59.415]  How would our elites... I mean, because I understand China and Russia are bad, and so you can create arguments to do Machiavellian things for the greater good, but that always leads into corruption.
[02:26:59.915 --> 02:27:10.321]  But such conscious evil to put Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra, ISIS in charge, blowing up every church, chopping people's heads off, murdering families.
[02:27:10.361 --> 02:27:11.902]  I mean, these really are bad people.
[02:27:12.383 --> 02:27:20.107]  How did our elite get to the point that they thought they could get away with an Al-Qaeda proxy army taking over the whole Middle East?
[02:27:20.167 --> 02:27:22.729]  I mean, they've got to know the genie's out of the bottle.
[02:27:23.049 --> 02:27:27.692]  People now understand that our government's capable of this.
[02:27:29.730 --> 02:27:45.666]  Yes, you know, what's out of the bottle is the fact that you've unleashed on the world a bunch of jihadists that you've created, you've armed, you've given the propaganda reason, you've created the hatred towards America that gins up all of this, even though America's doing this.
[02:27:46.968 --> 02:27:48.730]  This can't be put back in the bottle.
[02:27:49.190 --> 02:28:01.820]  That's refugee situation in Europe, for example, is turning into a nightmare of chaos and of riots and of destruction of public property, which is being very much covered up by the media.
[02:28:01.980 --> 02:28:07.545]  And your website, InfoWars, is putting out that information as well as other people in Europe.
[02:28:07.765 --> 02:28:09.667]  WorldAffairsBrief.com is exposing it.
[02:28:10.387 --> 02:28:11.147]  Yes, that's right.
[02:28:11.207 --> 02:28:13.268]  I mean, it's just horrendous.
[02:28:13.648 --> 02:28:20.491]  But you know, there's this multicultural agenda that is on the rocks because people are in up in arms in Europe, stop these refugees.
[02:28:20.771 --> 02:28:23.632]  And I think the globalists are at a crucial point.
[02:28:23.953 --> 02:28:27.234]  As we speak here, every one of their agendas have backfired.
[02:28:27.614 --> 02:28:28.734]  They've gone overboard.
[02:28:29.555 --> 02:28:34.397]  And I hate to say this, but we owe it to Russia from stopping this agenda right now.
[02:28:35.257 --> 02:28:40.100]  Is this probably the biggest unraveling of the globalist agenda we've seen since Bretton Woods?
[02:28:40.140 --> 02:28:46.383]  I mean, is this not one of the most spectacular spectacles we've ever seen?
[02:28:47.827 --> 02:28:50.008]  Well, Bretton Woods was actually a success.
[02:28:50.108 --> 02:28:51.589]  It's what... No, no, that's what I'm saying.
[02:28:51.629 --> 02:28:56.231]  Since the launch of this current system, is this not one of the most spectacular train wrecks?
[02:28:57.291 --> 02:29:04.975]  It is, and it could even get worse for them if Russia and Hezbollah and Iranian Revolutionary Guard are able to actually defeat ISIS.
[02:29:05.655 --> 02:29:06.616]  I mean, the U.S.
[02:29:06.656 --> 02:29:10.160]  will literally be the laughingstock of the international community.
[02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:17.268]  They will no longer be able to say, our military intervention is going to provide the excuse that it has in the past.
[02:29:17.708 --> 02:29:21.152]  And that's going to be a real problem for global, because they depend on
[02:29:22.313 --> 02:29:22.934]  I don't know.
[02:29:37.270 --> 02:29:38.270]  Unbelievable.
[02:29:38.430 --> 02:29:40.571]  So, it is a giant train wreck.
[02:29:40.611 --> 02:29:41.671]  I agree with Joel Skousen.
[02:29:41.711 --> 02:29:43.052]  He brings amazing clarity.
[02:29:43.332 --> 02:29:45.612]  You'll find more of that clarity at worldaffairsbrief.com.
[02:29:46.012 --> 02:29:48.113]  I think you're insane if you don't visit that site every day.
[02:29:48.493 --> 02:29:49.994]  And, of course, infowars.com.
[02:29:50.034 --> 02:29:54.135]  Joe Biggs is going to pop in from the Bloomberg anti-gun rally in Austin.
[02:29:54.355 --> 02:29:56.776]  Then we'll go back to Joel Skousen and take your calls.
[02:29:56.816 --> 02:29:57.276]  Stay with us.
[02:29:58.596 --> 02:29:59.476]  We're on the march.
[02:29:59.976 --> 02:30:01.577]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.497 --> 02:30:05.178]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.844 --> 02:30:12.285]  Have you waited your whole life to become a mother?
[02:30:12.585 --> 02:30:15.705]  Well, you're probably a racist, sexist, homophobe.
[02:30:16.066 --> 02:30:29.949]  LGBT activists have already convinced the Midwives Alliance of North America to stop referring to their clients as women and mothers, and instead call them pregnant people and birthing individuals, so transsexuals won't get offended.
[02:30:30.649 --> 02:30:35.295]  Numerous midwives have protested this language change, calling it an attack on women.
[02:30:35.635 --> 02:30:50.013]  In an open letter, they say, by embracing the idea that any human, other than those in a class called women, can carry offspring to term, give birth to them, and nurse them, we are prioritizing gender identity over biological reality.
[02:30:50.653 --> 02:30:56.138]  Obviously this ideology contributes to the cultural erasure of women's unique power to give birth.
[02:30:56.599 --> 02:30:58.801]  It is encoded in our female bodies.
[02:30:59.101 --> 02:31:02.844]  That's what creates, nourishes, and births live offspring.
[02:31:03.345 --> 02:31:05.727]  For more reports, visit InfoWars.com.

[02:33:15.023 --> 02:33:16.584]  We got some bad news, folks.
[02:33:19.885 --> 02:33:24.947]  We knew it was coming.
[02:33:26.827 --> 02:33:31.269]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:33:31.869 --> 02:33:33.350]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:36.191 --> 02:33:41.373]  Stalin said that one man dies, it's a tragedy, 10,000 dies, it's a statistic.
[02:33:41.413 --> 02:33:41.813]  He knew that.
[02:33:42.943 --> 02:33:59.187]  And you can have all of these hundreds of thousands of people killed by different radical jihad factions of the Sunni groups directed out of Saudi Arabia, funded and armed by the West, and they're just dehumanized.
[02:34:01.687 --> 02:34:04.128]  But as the war machine continues turning,
[02:34:07.725 --> 02:34:13.492]  It doesn't matter if we have 11,000 gun deaths a year, most of them suicide, the others gang-related.
[02:34:14.514 --> 02:34:20.081]  What, 167 people on average in the last decade are killed in mass shootings every year.
[02:34:20.101 --> 02:34:20.081]  167.
[02:34:20.321 --> 02:34:23.786]  White-tailed deer kill almost 300 a year.
[02:34:24.466 --> 02:34:25.388]  Jumping in front of your car.
[02:34:26.769 --> 02:34:31.950]  But they create the perception that gun crime's up and the perception that owning a gun causes the problem.
[02:34:32.230 --> 02:34:38.371]  Then they advertise gun-free zones for ISIS to hit or for a mentally ill person to attack.
[02:34:40.011 --> 02:34:41.952]  Like it's an option, like Suicide by Cop.
[02:34:41.972 --> 02:34:45.892]  The more they do shows about Suicide by Cop, the more people go, I don't want to kill myself.
[02:34:46.312 --> 02:34:49.093]  I'll go out and pull a gun on cops and my family will get a settlement.
[02:34:49.973 --> 02:34:51.013]  Well, it's happened.
[02:34:51.033 --> 02:34:55.494]  20 injured in shooting at Oregon Community College, shooter in custody officials say.
[02:34:56.271 --> 02:35:06.735]  We're going to have Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson, the rallies over, the anti-gun rally they ran at UT, trying to ban guns on campus because the state's passing a law to arm people on campus.
[02:35:07.375 --> 02:35:08.336]  And here's another example.
[02:35:08.496 --> 02:35:11.577]  UCC in Oregon has a total gun ban.
[02:35:12.197 --> 02:35:14.058]  We should put a story out on this because I looked it up.
[02:35:14.678 --> 02:35:21.841]  Approximately 20 people have been injured, 15 dead, in a shooting at a community college in Douglas County, Oregon, according to an official.
[02:35:22.659 --> 02:35:27.282]  The injured includes a woman who was shot in the chest, said Chris Boyce, a Douglas County Commissioner.
[02:35:27.342 --> 02:35:31.044]  The shooting began within the last 30 minutes of the UCC College.
[02:35:33.326 --> 02:35:34.867]  The shooter is down and in custody.
[02:35:37.268 --> 02:35:40.310]  We will continue to update as that unfolds, KTLA 5.
[02:35:42.351 --> 02:35:51.537]  Our prayers go out, because hey, even if it's a very low number of people killed in mass shootings, despite they advertised to mentally ill people to do it, still, one person dies, it is a tragedy.
[02:35:53.314 --> 02:35:56.035]  If 5 million children get aborted, it's tragedy.
[02:35:56.075 --> 02:35:57.975]  Or if 55 million get aborted, it's tragedy too.
[02:35:59.675 --> 02:36:00.996]  So, all lives matter.
[02:36:01.056 --> 02:36:01.976]  Black lives matter.
[02:36:02.256 --> 02:36:03.076]  White lives matter.
[02:36:03.136 --> 02:36:04.236]  Little kids' lives matter.
[02:36:04.536 --> 02:36:05.617]  Old people's lives matter.
[02:36:05.777 --> 02:36:06.797]  Veterans' lives matter.
[02:36:07.037 --> 02:36:08.317]  Police officers' lives matter.
[02:36:09.477 --> 02:36:10.638]  Catholics' lives matter.
[02:36:10.898 --> 02:36:12.398]  Islamic people's lives matter.
[02:36:13.298 --> 02:36:14.338]  Atheists' lives matter.
[02:36:16.779 --> 02:36:19.699]  And this will be used now to come after our guns.
[02:36:19.739 --> 02:36:21.920]  We know there's a huge new offensive to get the guns.
[02:36:23.195 --> 02:36:26.057]  And I was just saying earlier today, I hope they don't stage something.
[02:36:26.157 --> 02:36:27.338]  Some of these things are real.
[02:36:28.239 --> 02:36:31.101]  A lot of these, like the Aurora shooting, and I don't say this lightly.
[02:36:31.121 --> 02:36:32.482]  I don't have time to go over the evidence.
[02:36:32.622 --> 02:36:36.205]  I mean, folks, that was as phony as a $3 bill.
[02:36:36.725 --> 02:36:44.531]  You just put somebody on amnesia drugs, hop them up, put them in a car for the cops to find them, go in, shoot the people, and then the patsy doesn't even know what happened.
[02:36:44.571 --> 02:36:45.392]  Sir hand, sir hand.
[02:36:46.332 --> 02:36:52.297]  The police report in LA on RFK said he didn't shoot them and was drugged.
[02:36:53.590 --> 02:36:55.292]  I've talked to detectives that were on the case.
[02:36:56.614 --> 02:36:58.536]  And it's come out the CIA was there that day.
[02:36:58.576 --> 02:36:59.977]  I'm not going to digress off into that.
[02:37:00.038 --> 02:37:03.441]  It's just it's very easy to stage this stuff.
[02:37:03.862 --> 02:37:10.730]  But there's another form of staging it that's culturally advertising mass shootings then makes them a reality.
[02:37:13.496 --> 02:37:14.438]  I'm done talking about that.
[02:37:14.458 --> 02:37:17.845]  We'll have Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson in studio with Leon McAdoo.
[02:37:18.366 --> 02:37:19.187]  Leon McAdoo.
[02:37:19.488 --> 02:37:24.878]  Leanne McAdoo coming up in the fourth hour of Overdrive today.
[02:37:26.411 --> 02:37:29.214]  Joel Skousen of WorldAffairsBrief.com is our guest.
[02:37:29.534 --> 02:37:34.400]  We've got callers loaded from Tanner to Tom to Steve to Chase to Zach.
[02:37:34.420 --> 02:37:41.167]  We'll get to your quick questions or comments and then of course it's on the same subject and then Joel Skousen can comment on those or you can comment on those.
[02:37:41.207 --> 02:37:46.092]  But Joel, I've been asking a lot of the questions today, amazing answers we've been getting from you.
[02:37:47.657 --> 02:37:54.423]  Overall, if the globalists are being handed all these big setbacks, I agree with you, they tend to double down in their hubris and arrogance.
[02:37:55.624 --> 02:37:58.286]  But how do you double down with other nuclear powers?
[02:37:59.186 --> 02:38:03.550]  What if Israel starts striking Russian targets or kills Russians?
[02:38:04.631 --> 02:38:09.234]  You said you don't think the Russians would want to be involved in that, but once committed
[02:38:09.955 --> 02:38:14.899]  Couldn't this escalate really quickly and we wake up and there's a bigger regional war?
[02:38:14.959 --> 02:38:20.504]  I mean, as you know, this is how World War I, World War II started, is with these incremental ratcheting up.
[02:38:20.844 --> 02:38:26.949]  Am I right to say the world has reached almost a Cuban Missile Crisis level situation right now?
[02:38:28.559 --> 02:38:29.520]  Not yet, Alex.
[02:38:30.801 --> 02:38:33.643]  It's very, very clear that Russia is being very careful.
[02:38:34.243 --> 02:38:46.151]  If they really wanted to go full bore into this, they'd put their own special forces troops into Syria because they're much, much better than even Hezbollah and the Revolutionary Guards.
[02:38:47.232 --> 02:38:51.635]  So I don't think that they want to risk because they're not ready for war yet.
[02:38:51.735 --> 02:38:54.437]  I mean, as I pointed out many times in the World Affairs Brief,
[02:38:55.097 --> 02:39:02.301]  Russia and China still aren't going to have their top-of-the-line weapon systems in production until 2021, 22, and 23, and 24.
[02:39:02.861 --> 02:39:12.147]  And so it's going to take, I mean, that's the reason that Putin is doing a stealth war in Ukraine rather than in-your-face invasion.
[02:39:12.867 --> 02:39:21.432]  He's taking back these former Soviet states little by little, not enough to antagonize or force the West to confront him.
[02:39:22.185 --> 02:39:25.306]  And I think that's the reason why he's not committed to troops.
[02:39:25.366 --> 02:39:32.709]  You know, the Russian press says we don't want another Afghanistan, but the Russian hierarchy doesn't care about democracy or what public opinion is.
[02:39:32.749 --> 02:39:33.829]  They do what they want to do.
[02:39:34.490 --> 02:39:43.413]  And so the reason for not sending troops into Syria has to be because they don't want to have a major war provocation with the West or Israel.
[02:39:44.673 --> 02:39:48.035]  But as I say, I pointed out that Israel may well be
[02:39:50.100 --> 02:39:54.246]  The spearhead for the globals to try to get another angle into Syria.
[02:39:54.346 --> 02:39:56.449]  Oh, their defense minister said they're going to act.
[02:39:58.611 --> 02:39:59.893]  They just didn't say exactly how.
[02:40:00.774 --> 02:40:01.475]  No, that's right.
[02:40:02.506 --> 02:40:17.839]  You know, there's a difference between what they say and what they do, but clearly the Israelis, I think, are the only card left that the globalists have to change this situation in Syria that right now Russia is controlling and the U.S.
[02:40:17.859 --> 02:40:18.439]  can't do anything.
[02:40:18.820 --> 02:40:20.361]  And you'll notice that the U.S.
[02:40:20.421 --> 02:40:25.726]  isn't even doing airstrikes right now because the Russians are in the airspace, and there's a real tremendous
[02:40:26.686 --> 02:40:28.688]  Conflict there between airplanes.
[02:40:28.748 --> 02:40:29.709]  So the U.S.
[02:40:29.729 --> 02:40:32.832]  war on ISIS is basically on hold until they figure out what to do.
[02:40:34.033 --> 02:40:35.995]  But as you said, it was never really a real war.
[02:40:36.035 --> 02:40:37.636]  They just blow up an old truck or something.
[02:40:37.656 --> 02:40:39.538]  It was completely staged.
[02:40:40.599 --> 02:40:40.979]  That's right.
[02:40:40.999 --> 02:40:43.462]  They were always going after little tiny targets.
[02:40:43.642 --> 02:40:49.067]  Individuals, yes, you would kill, but you couldn't get permission to attack any of the headquarters.
[02:40:49.147 --> 02:40:51.249]  And Russia just hit some of those headquarters.
[02:40:51.889 --> 02:40:57.552]  So they're going to be able to effectively diminish ISIS very quickly.
[02:40:57.632 --> 02:41:00.213]  I think you're going to see the Russian escalation happen.
[02:41:00.594 --> 02:41:02.515]  They're talking about coordinating with the West.
[02:41:03.035 --> 02:41:15.841]  I just don't see the West happening or doing that, because the more the West coordinates with Russia, the more they would have to show their hand that, no, we don't want to hit this particular target.
[02:41:15.881 --> 02:41:16.842]  No, you shouldn't hit this.
[02:41:17.182 --> 02:41:20.543]  They're going to be having to tell the Russians not to hit targets they want to preserve.
[02:41:20.863 --> 02:41:22.083]  And they don't want to get away with that.
[02:41:22.163 --> 02:41:24.404]  So I just don't think we're going to see coordination.
[02:41:24.724 --> 02:41:27.485]  I think Russia is going to take the handle.
[02:41:27.625 --> 02:41:30.166]  I think ISIS is going to be severely diminished.
[02:41:30.846 --> 02:41:38.188]  And the whole globalist agenda in the Middle East is sunk now, especially since Iran has got this agreement with the U.S.
[02:41:39.128 --> 02:41:42.330]  And they're going to continue to build militarily and the U.S.
[02:41:42.370 --> 02:41:43.711]  isn't going to be able to touch them.
[02:41:44.712 --> 02:41:46.092]  What about Saudi Arabia?
[02:41:46.573 --> 02:41:51.796]  They obviously have a huge weapons platform but aren't too good, at least historically, in wars.
[02:41:52.196 --> 02:41:53.897]  Look at what's happening in Yemen right now.
[02:41:53.997 --> 02:42:06.665]  But their government head and a bunch of their top princes, as you know, came out yesterday and threatened Russia and said, do not enter into this area or we're going to escalate our military response.
[02:42:07.185 --> 02:42:13.153]  They didn't say specifically what they were going to do, but Russia just responded by massive airstrikes just 12 hours later.
[02:42:13.193 --> 02:42:15.957]  So I don't think Russia is being intimidated by Saudi Arabia.
[02:42:16.894 --> 02:42:19.156]  Saudi Arabia is a paper tiger militarily.
[02:42:19.296 --> 02:42:29.564]  You look at Yemen, they can't beat this ragtag Yemenese army with all their airstrikes and they certainly can't go up against anybody really trained in air-to-air combat.
[02:42:31.686 --> 02:42:35.289]  I don't care if they have F-16s or not, they're going to get shot out of the sky by the Russians.
[02:42:35.329 --> 02:42:38.371]  So I think this is just a paper threat from Saudi Arabia.
[02:42:38.391 --> 02:42:39.793]  I think Israel's the only
[02:42:40.453 --> 02:43:04.475]  Capable military on the globalist side that could intervene But it's a I think even the Israelis would think twice about going up against the Russians So this is a mega bold move Yeah, this is this is the globalists are stopped dead in the water and they they don't know what to do right now because
[02:43:05.894 --> 02:43:15.442]  You know, you see, with the globalist agenda of wanting World War III in order to create the excuse for a new world order, they cannot, however, start it.
[02:43:16.042 --> 02:43:17.964]  They can't be looked as the blame of this thing.
[02:43:17.984 --> 02:43:20.666]  They've got to wait for Russia and China to do something.
[02:43:20.946 --> 02:43:24.649]  And now they've been caught launching a giant proxy war, which makes them the villain.
[02:43:24.849 --> 02:43:26.691]  I mean, the average American may not know this.
[02:43:26.771 --> 02:43:27.471]  More and more do.
[02:43:27.652 --> 02:43:29.353]  But worldwide, everybody knows.
[02:43:29.653 --> 02:43:32.275]  This is a devastating propaganda defeat.
[02:43:32.556 --> 02:43:35.318]  I mean, this has got to show the globalists that they're not invincible.
[02:43:37.895 --> 02:43:38.535]  Well, that's right.
[02:43:39.916 --> 02:43:46.140]  You know, I have never seen the Globalists defeated until the one mistake by Kerry on the chemical weapons treatment in Syria, and now this.
[02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:54.644]  And this is much bigger because this is Russia actually intervening and directly thwarting the Globalists in a very sophisticated way.
[02:43:55.865 --> 02:43:59.346]  Hedging their bets and being careful not to intervene too strongly.
[02:43:59.606 --> 02:44:09.168]  And I've just never seen the globalist agenda taking a step back until this last three years and particularly this last week.
[02:44:09.348 --> 02:44:13.529]  What do you expect them to pull now, though, to try to pull a rabbit out of a hat?
[02:44:13.589 --> 02:44:16.770]  Or will they lie low and just try to recalibrate?
[02:44:18.416 --> 02:44:20.857]  I think they have to let this play its course.
[02:44:21.057 --> 02:44:27.419]  You know, there's not much you can do once your terrorist creation, ISIS, is now under the Russian gun.
[02:44:27.439 --> 02:44:31.340]  I mean, you can't go out and create a new terrorist force in the same area.
[02:44:31.380 --> 02:44:32.880]  Russians can attack that, too.
[02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:37.742]  I think they have to actually let it run its course, and that means that ISIS is going down.
[02:44:37.762 --> 02:44:43.583]  At best, they can work for a compromise replacement of Assad.
[02:44:43.783 --> 02:44:44.724]  Putin has said he's
[02:44:46.344 --> 02:44:51.668]  Open to replacing Assad, but it has to be a democratic... But then they'll try to double-cross whoever that guy is.
[02:44:51.948 --> 02:44:52.429]  That's right.
[02:44:52.689 --> 02:44:54.050]  They'll try to double-cross that.
[02:44:54.671 --> 02:45:02.436]  But I don't see any quick solutions the globalists could possibly come up with that can change the dynamic as long as Russia is there.
[02:45:02.477 --> 02:45:04.118]  They're going to have to let us play its course.
[02:45:04.598 --> 02:45:14.526]  ISIS is probably going to go down over time, or it may move into a different area, but it's not going to go anywhere in Syria with the Russians there.
[02:45:15.026 --> 02:45:16.907]  What about that western area of Iraq?
[02:45:16.927 --> 02:45:19.447]  They're holding part of their IS kingdom.
[02:45:19.467 --> 02:45:22.328]  Do you think the Iraqis will be able to root them out of there?
[02:45:25.709 --> 02:45:29.730]  You know, they could change their base of operations to that Iraqi area.
[02:45:31.824 --> 02:45:37.288]  Uh, but you know, if the Russians are smart, they'll make an alliance with the Kurds to go after those people, too.
[02:45:38.008 --> 02:45:40.370]  They won't stop within Syria itself.
[02:45:42.171 --> 02:45:46.674]  I think the Russians could make a lot of hay by teaming up.
[02:45:46.734 --> 02:45:48.755]  They're already teaming up with some of the Iraqis.
[02:45:48.796 --> 02:45:50.457]  The Iraqis are tired of the U.S.
[02:45:50.897 --> 02:45:53.138]  limiting their ability to attack ISIS.
[02:45:53.639 --> 02:45:55.100]  And the Iraqis, of course, know that
[02:45:55.640 --> 02:45:59.984]  They saw US helicopters resupplying ISIS during the Battle of Mosul.
[02:46:00.425 --> 02:46:06.891]  The US Navy was prohibited from striking their parade down the street after the victory in Mosul.
[02:46:08.459 --> 02:46:10.400]  I mean, that's what blew the cover on the U.S.
[02:46:11.021 --> 02:46:14.042]  towards its claim that they were fighting ISIS.
[02:46:15.283 --> 02:46:21.687]  I think this is probably going to take another two years to eliminate ISIS, and Russia's going to grow in stature.
[02:46:22.207 --> 02:46:31.613]  The one thing that's still going to bring down, that could bring down Russia in public esteem, is if they continue their stealth war in Ukraine.
[02:46:33.194 --> 02:46:40.658]  They may have to pull back on that in order to take advantage of this leadership advantage that they've gained in the war on terror.
[02:46:42.419 --> 02:46:44.620]  What do you expect the globals to do to punish people?
[02:46:44.640 --> 02:46:49.083]  I mean, who is to blame in the power structure when you got Kissinger pointing the finger at Obama?
[02:46:49.563 --> 02:47:00.486]  Obviously, this is part of his strategy, James Baker's strategy, Zbigniew Brzezinski's strategy, the Rockefeller strategy, the big think tank Pentagon strategy, the neocon strategy.
[02:47:00.846 --> 02:47:04.587]  I mean, it's all a big consortium that came to this consensus.
[02:47:05.548 --> 02:47:13.210]  So, how do they even reform themselves when they're all about never getting blamed for anything, temporarily but also spiritually?
[02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:18.623]  Boy, you have some very complex questions you throw at me, Alex.
[02:47:19.064 --> 02:47:20.085]  But you get what I'm saying.
[02:47:20.325 --> 02:47:24.629]  How are they going to reform their new or older takeover when it's all about dodging responsibility?
[02:47:27.975 --> 02:47:32.017]  Yeah, I think the key is going to be electing a new team.
[02:47:32.077 --> 02:47:37.239]  You know, I think they're basically washing their hands of Obama and the present team.
[02:47:37.279 --> 02:47:40.340]  They're going to reform under the new Republican leadership they're going to give us.
[02:47:41.141 --> 02:47:45.863]  If they can get George Bush elected or some other controlled Republican right now,
[02:47:46.383 --> 02:47:48.804]  You know, this election is in disarray.
[02:47:49.084 --> 02:47:55.686]  They promoted Trump in order to discredit his uncareful remarks about immigration, but the public loved it.
[02:47:56.146 --> 02:48:00.848]  They can't stop Trump, even though they keep saying his poll numbers are going down, they really aren't.
[02:48:02.248 --> 02:48:09.751]  You know, Ben Carson, another uncontrolled candidate, is coming up equal with Trump.
[02:48:10.471 --> 02:48:13.792]  Globalists have got three major defeats now at their hand.
[02:48:14.612 --> 02:48:23.983]  And they're really scrambling, but they need a Republican to take the mantle away from Obama to claim we're starting anew and let the conservatives get on board.
[02:48:24.063 --> 02:48:29.350]  But they'll be behind that Republican president guiding his neocon philosophy just as before.
[02:48:31.590 --> 02:48:35.453]  What is your gut, also you do deep research, what is your gut on Trump?
[02:48:35.473 --> 02:48:36.895]  What type of person he really is?
[02:48:37.215 --> 02:48:41.699]  Because obviously he knows that the establishment makes him more popular attacking him.
[02:48:41.719 --> 02:48:49.826]  That's what I told Rand Paul, I told Politico, I said if you Rand Paul you want to win, you've got to be the underdog, you've got to be the outsider, not the guy that works for the system.
[02:48:49.846 --> 02:48:54.490]  Even though I respect him like Rand Paul, Trump obviously at a street level knows how to win.
[02:48:54.510 --> 02:48:59.134]  My only question is, does he work for Trump or does he work for the globalists?
[02:49:01.328 --> 02:49:08.254]  I don't think he works for the globalists, but I don't think he's principled enough.
[02:49:08.274 --> 02:49:13.758]  In fact, I'm sure he's not principled enough that he couldn't be controlled by the globalists if he were to get in.
[02:49:13.818 --> 02:49:21.124]  Now, I personally don't think that he would be good for the conservatives or the globalists because, for one, he won't read a script.
[02:49:21.825 --> 02:49:24.167]  He won't even write his own script and stick to it.
[02:49:24.187 --> 02:49:25.588]  He has to speak off the cuff.
[02:49:25.648 --> 02:49:27.850]  This shows a person that is very impatient.
[02:49:28.450 --> 02:49:37.256]  He's a dramatic go-getter who just doesn't have the patience to carefully write or describe an argument and stick to it.
[02:49:38.437 --> 02:49:47.344]  He's a bull in the China closet and he would be an embarrassment to the United States just because of the errors that he would say.
[02:49:47.504 --> 02:49:49.946]  But I have to say that Trump is basically right.
[02:49:50.706 --> 02:49:52.128]  On the immigration policy.
[02:49:52.829 --> 02:49:55.613]  He's okay on certain tax policy.
[02:49:55.673 --> 02:49:57.976]  He's a disaster on the Syrian policy, though.
[02:49:58.357 --> 02:50:04.765]  He's bought into the argument that Assad has to go because Assad attacked his people with chemical weapons.
[02:50:05.206 --> 02:50:07.929]  And of course, John Kerry came out with the barrel bomb thing about
[02:50:09.542 --> 02:50:14.645]  Assad using barrel bombs on his own people, which is absolutely false.
[02:50:14.665 --> 02:50:18.347]  They only use barrel bombs on the other rebels, not on their own people.
[02:50:19.348 --> 02:50:22.509]  But it shows that the United States is continuing to lie about Assad.
[02:50:22.549 --> 02:50:27.612]  And unfortunately, Trump did not pick up and did not do his research on this.
[02:50:28.153 --> 02:50:33.956]  I don't know how he can be so right on immigration and the illegal alien problem and be so off.
[02:50:34.016 --> 02:50:35.217]  What do you think about his tax plan?
[02:50:38.397 --> 02:50:39.567]  Well, his tax plan...
[02:50:41.249 --> 02:50:45.432]  Actually, I don't like any of these tax plans because they still do maintain the IRS.
[02:50:45.452 --> 02:50:46.874]  They still do have an income base.
[02:50:46.934 --> 02:50:48.715]  Even a flat tax doesn't... Exactly!
[02:50:48.735 --> 02:50:49.916]  You've just got to get rid of the income tax.
[02:50:49.936 --> 02:50:50.817]  It's unconstitutional.
[02:50:51.097 --> 02:50:52.178]  To the Communist Manifesto.
[02:50:52.198 --> 02:50:53.779]  Joel Skousen, stay there with us, my friend.
[02:50:53.799 --> 02:50:56.061]  I want to get to a few calls for you on the other side.
[02:50:56.141 --> 02:50:58.723]  Tanner, and who else has been holding the longest?
[02:50:58.843 --> 02:51:00.304]  Tom, Zach, a few others.
[02:51:00.544 --> 02:51:02.046]  We'll do five minutes in the next hour.
[02:51:02.066 --> 02:51:05.428]  And then we've got Leanne McAdoo with a whole fourth hour for you.
[02:51:05.668 --> 02:51:08.030]  WorldAffairsBrief.com is Joel Skousen's website.
[02:51:08.931 --> 02:51:12.734]  Did you know that the average cost for a family of four to attend a professional baseball game is over $200?

[02:51:18.918 --> 02:51:21.780]  So how come we're all paying so much when so many seats go empty?

[02:53:08.682 --> 02:53:19.247]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens that often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.
[02:53:19.767 --> 02:53:23.529]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[02:54:10.703 --> 02:54:15.845]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:16.525 --> 02:54:18.866]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:54:19.947 --> 02:54:27.990]  Please don't ever forget that they have mainstream establishment media lying about us almost every day on national television or in major papers.
[02:54:28.470 --> 02:54:31.591]  And it's because, for all my problems, this is teleprompter free.
[02:54:31.892 --> 02:54:32.972]  We really care about freedom.
[02:54:32.992 --> 02:54:33.852]  We care about America.
[02:54:33.892 --> 02:54:34.633]  We care about you.
[02:54:34.653 --> 02:54:35.953]  We care about ourselves.
[02:54:36.413 --> 02:54:37.314]  We care about family.
[02:54:37.374 --> 02:54:38.234]  We care about life.
[02:54:38.554 --> 02:54:39.935]  We care about the right to self-defense.
[02:54:40.675 --> 02:54:44.798]  And we're unifying people around basic survival.
[02:54:45.579 --> 02:54:47.060]  The globalists are bad news.
[02:54:48.861 --> 02:54:55.766]  And just like Hitler or just like any other tyrant in history, they get delusional and believe they're invincible.
[02:54:56.386 --> 02:54:58.748]  And they might just destroy all of us in the process.
[02:55:00.469 --> 02:55:03.431]  So the hubris is starting to run into some problems.
[02:55:05.052 --> 02:55:06.373]  Who knows what they're going to do?
[02:55:08.732 --> 02:55:15.836]  But we're going to see a lot of power-grabbing, a lot of bizarre behavior now out of these people because they think they're invincible.
[02:55:16.356 --> 02:55:18.497]  And they think if they just double down they're going to be okay.
[02:55:18.917 --> 02:55:26.801]  Now is the time for the maximum effort exposing tyranny, the maximum effort getting prepared, the maximum effort to be spreading the word.
[02:55:27.502 --> 02:55:37.267]  And to also go to InfoWars.com, WorldAffairsBrief.com and other sites that tell the truth and appreciate the fact that that press is there because there's a major Western move
[02:55:37.967 --> 02:55:38.467]  We're good to go.
[02:55:54.093 --> 02:56:01.439]  It's almost comical, if it wasn't so serious, how flaming totalitarian the so-called left is.
[02:56:01.879 --> 02:56:08.685]  So right as they get exposed, they seem to be lurching into an even bigger display of arrogance.
[02:56:09.686 --> 02:56:11.307]  Have you seen that, or what's your view on it?
[02:56:12.526 --> 02:56:21.309]  Yes, it's amazing to me how they've talked about rating people in terms of their reliability of free speech on the Internet and banning people who get a low rating.
[02:56:21.829 --> 02:56:23.890]  I mean, this is a recipe for disaster.
[02:56:24.490 --> 02:56:27.531]  People are up in arms and rebelling against that kind of restriction.
[02:56:27.571 --> 02:56:28.732]  I think once again,
[02:56:29.272 --> 02:56:34.957]  As you said, the globalists are lurching and scrambling, and they're going to make mistakes now.
[02:56:35.437 --> 02:56:37.840]  They haven't had a major setback in years.
[02:56:38.240 --> 02:56:44.966]  They've just been able to calculate, plan, and devise conflict creation without any interference from anyone.
[02:56:45.266 --> 02:56:46.907]  Suddenly, it's all breaking down.
[02:56:48.108 --> 02:56:52.692]  So, this may just buy us more time, and that's important for people's preparation.
[02:56:53.172 --> 02:56:57.355]  The main threat that I keep worrying about is eventual war with Russia and China.
[02:56:57.816 --> 02:56:59.897]  That still is on the docket.
[02:56:59.957 --> 02:57:01.038]  It's not real soon.
[02:57:01.058 --> 02:57:09.805]  I think we're going to pass through this time without a major economic collapse that people keep warning about.
[02:57:09.905 --> 02:57:12.467]  But historically, major powers are going to collide.
[02:57:12.567 --> 02:57:15.209]  All the demographics, all the graphs show that.
[02:57:16.257 --> 02:57:21.624]  That's right, without question, but it is further away than people think because Russia and China aren't ready yet.
[02:57:22.085 --> 02:57:30.276]  But remember, when that finally happens, you're going to get not only economic collapse commensurate with that, an EMP strike, no electricity in the grid.
[02:57:31.317 --> 02:57:36.340]  If you think you need preparations, boy, when war comes, it's like nothing else.
[02:57:36.620 --> 02:57:50.748]  And when it comes, our entire civilization seems or ceases to be like it is, and we lose all of our ability to make a living, and we go into a massive survival mode against the total social unrest.
[02:57:51.388 --> 02:57:59.513]  So even though I have been decrying the hypesters, you know, who keep talking about this coming earlier, martial law coming earlier, when it does come,
[02:58:00.333 --> 02:58:01.394]  Commence it with war.
[02:58:01.474 --> 02:58:03.955]  It's going to be so serious that you've got to be ready.
[02:58:04.175 --> 02:58:17.002]  And we know it's coming because the elite all over the world, but especially here, are, as you know, huge programs, much bigger than the Manhattan Project, to harden bunkers, to go underground, to create alternative systems.
[02:58:17.342 --> 02:58:21.724]  I mean, there is a buildup much bigger than the Cold War going on and accelerated speed.
[02:58:21.884 --> 02:58:22.905]  They're not doing that for nothing.
[02:58:23.826 --> 02:58:24.606]  Absolutely right.
[02:58:24.746 --> 02:58:26.807]  And they're not doing this because of terrorism.
[02:58:26.927 --> 02:58:34.930]  They know that a major nuclear strike is going to fall on the United States, that EMP will be here at some time, and that's why they're preparing these huge underground bunkers.
[02:58:34.950 --> 02:58:44.172]  That's why ex-TIA, FBI directors, and other people are building, you know, bunkers underneath their resort homes in the Colorado Rockies.
[02:58:44.272 --> 02:58:44.653]  Stay there.
[02:58:44.673 --> 02:58:48.034]  Back in 70 seconds, we're going to jam in a few phone calls and overdrive, folks.
[02:58:48.074 --> 02:58:48.654]  A full hour.
[02:58:48.954 --> 02:58:51.075]  Leanne McAdoo, Joel Skousen is our guest.
[02:58:51.095 --> 02:58:52.075]  We've got to get him back.
[02:58:52.495 --> 02:58:53.015]  Much sooner.
[02:58:53.035 --> 02:58:53.855]  Stay with us.
[02:58:53.915 --> 02:58:55.396]  Some stations don't carry this next hour.

[03:00:11.920 --> 03:00:17.946]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:18.546 --> 03:00:21.589]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:26.694 --> 03:00:30.977]  Final segment, I'm hosting Leanne McAdoo coming up to cover a score of issues.
[03:00:32.509 --> 03:00:33.650]  We got loaded phone lines.
[03:00:33.730 --> 03:00:35.671]  If folks want to hold over, they can talk to McAdoo.
[03:00:35.711 --> 03:00:36.652]  She'd love to talk to you.
[03:00:36.992 --> 03:00:42.435]  Tanner from Texas, you're on the air speaking with Joel Skousen, the editor-in-chief of World Affairs Brief.
[03:00:42.475 --> 03:00:44.677]  Go ahead.
[03:00:44.717 --> 03:00:45.817]  Yeah, I had a question.
[03:00:46.118 --> 03:00:53.542]  It seems like every time you bring up 9-11, you mention that all you say is that Saudi Arabia did 9-11.
[03:00:53.723 --> 03:00:55.504]  That's not what I said.
[03:00:56.294 --> 03:00:59.176]  Well, I mean, over the last six months, that's all you say.
[03:00:59.376 --> 03:01:03.419]  You know, you say 9-11 and then you say Saudi Arabia did 9-11, Saudi Arabia quarterback 9-11.
[03:01:04.682 --> 03:01:15.312]  My thing is, you know, with all this stuff with World Trade Center 7, with the BBC, you know, predicting it and then cutting the feed off before the building could be seen collapsing behind her, and... Hold on just a second.
[03:01:15.672 --> 03:01:22.739]  You know I broke all that and popularized that, and I made like five films on it, and I said there's shadowy groups in the government that stood down and clearly were involved.
[03:01:23.140 --> 03:01:25.041]  We've said that just ad nauseam.
[03:01:25.522 --> 03:01:29.626]  I'm hammering to get the 28 pages out, because if you expose the Saudi involvement,
[03:01:30.146 --> 03:01:32.228]  Then you expose their collaborators.
[03:01:32.668 --> 03:01:44.058]  So, my point is, I've declared victory in the fact that those of us that said it was an inside job were right, because if our government knew and stood down, that's just as much as involved as if they loaded bombs in the buildings.
[03:01:44.318 --> 03:01:46.580]  I want to get Joel Skousen's take on who he thinks is involved.
[03:01:46.900 --> 03:01:51.965]  I'm not going to debate that I'm covering up 9-11 when I'm... I'm not going to brag, folks, but I'm the guy that first said it.
[03:01:52.205 --> 03:01:55.388]  I'm the guy that put my name on the line, lost almost all my affiliates,
[03:01:55.928 --> 03:02:01.474]  Well, I can just say that from an outsider's perspective, listening to a radio show, it just sounds like somebody's trying to point our military at the world's largest oil reserve.
[03:02:19.289 --> 03:02:27.191]  It just doesn't seem like, you know, like you really believe that the Saudi Arabia's rigged up the buildings with TNT and that you really believe they fed the script to the BBC.
[03:02:27.211 --> 03:02:30.292]  I don't think you believe any of that.
[03:02:30.392 --> 03:02:36.594]  Saudi Arabia was heavily involved in 9-11 with a bunch of other Western governments that I've made films and named them.
[03:02:39.494 --> 03:02:42.517]  It's like saying if I was Henry Ford, I hated Ford.
[03:02:42.637 --> 03:02:44.420]  I don't even know how to respond to you right now.
[03:02:44.740 --> 03:02:46.362]  I've exposed every aspect of 9-11.
[03:02:46.642 --> 03:02:51.047]  Joel Skousen, you've been on probably 20 times talking about 9-11 being an inside job.
[03:02:51.308 --> 03:02:54.011]  Give us your take on what you believe happened on 9-11 from the evidence.
[03:02:55.100 --> 03:02:57.523]  Well, from the evidence, only the U.S.
[03:02:57.543 --> 03:03:06.254]  government had access to all the elements, including the cover-up, including the stand-down, including the lodium explosives, Silverstein and all of his relationship.
[03:03:06.574 --> 03:03:13.923]  The Saudis were actors in it because I think, for example, the named hijackers were not the real hijackers, they were the ones that were
[03:03:15.037 --> 03:03:17.118]  Cover hijackers for the CIA.
[03:03:17.158 --> 03:03:23.141]  The real ones were trained on big airliners, probably in Saudi Arabia, and that was a connection.
[03:03:23.961 --> 03:03:39.429]  Saudi Arabia did cover up and provide funding for the fake hijackers, the named fake hijackers in San Diego, and they paid for their... and that's what the 28 pages is all about, is that relationship between the San Diego group and Saudi Arabia.
[03:03:39.909 --> 03:03:47.331]  The reason the government's covering up for it is because if the Saudis get exposed, they're going to say, hey look, we were just working for the government.
[03:03:47.432 --> 03:03:52.973]  So the government does not want to expose Saudi Arabia because of the connection the Saudis have with the government.
[03:03:52.993 --> 03:03:53.974]  That's why I love Joel Skousen.
[03:03:54.014 --> 03:03:54.494]  He's smart.
[03:03:54.534 --> 03:03:55.734]  He gets what we're doing here.
[03:03:56.134 --> 03:03:57.395]  We've exposed the whole thing.
[03:03:57.435 --> 03:03:59.215]  We have a break in the case on this.
[03:03:59.456 --> 03:04:00.176]  We have them.
[03:04:01.056 --> 03:04:02.397]  By the you-know-what hairs.
[03:04:02.837 --> 03:04:04.137]  That's why I'm so excited.
[03:04:05.337 --> 03:04:10.899]  And smart patriots that know the truth about 9-11 and the military want to get this out and it'll bring the whole deal down.
[03:04:11.099 --> 03:04:13.180]  We're not trying to do this to invade Saudi Arabia.
[03:04:13.460 --> 03:04:14.581]  The globalists aren't going to do that.
[03:04:14.821 --> 03:04:16.621]  They're fighting to suppress it coming out.
[03:04:16.881 --> 03:04:18.362]  We're fighting to get it out.
[03:04:18.722 --> 03:04:20.963]  I mean, just last week we did a show about Building 7.
[03:04:21.843 --> 03:04:24.084]  I did another video last week on it.
[03:04:24.284 --> 03:04:26.665]  I mean, Joel Skousen, do you think I'm covering up 9-11?
[03:04:28.354 --> 03:04:28.795]  Not at all.
[03:04:28.815 --> 03:04:35.161]  In fact, I'm surprised at how often I have to defend you from emails that I get about Alex Jones being COINTELPRO.
[03:04:35.201 --> 03:04:36.703]  And I've told them, look, I know Alex.
[03:04:37.324 --> 03:04:38.084]  We have talked.
[03:04:38.104 --> 03:04:39.226]  We've broken bread together.
[03:04:39.246 --> 03:04:40.547]  This guy is sincere.
[03:04:40.567 --> 03:04:42.089]  He's working for the right cause.
[03:04:42.609 --> 03:04:44.271]  And I'll continue to stand on that.
[03:04:44.451 --> 03:04:45.591]  Well, God bless you, my friend.
[03:04:45.651 --> 03:04:47.752]  It's, I mean, next it'll be I work for the Federal Reserve.
[03:04:47.872 --> 03:04:51.814]  But, you know, that's what folks do, and it's very frustrating.
[03:04:52.174 --> 03:04:53.795]  But it's a complex world out there.
[03:04:54.195 --> 03:04:55.675]  I'll take any break in the case on 9-11.
[03:04:55.995 --> 03:04:57.516]  Joel Skousen, thank you so much.
[03:04:57.536 --> 03:04:58.776]  I think this is the best interview ever.
[03:04:59.137 --> 03:05:02.118]  Exciting news about ISIS getting their butt handed to them.
[03:05:02.398 --> 03:05:03.238]  God bless you, my friend.
[03:05:03.958 --> 03:05:04.659]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:05:05.419 --> 03:05:06.779]  Leanne McAdoo's coming up.
[03:05:09.093 --> 03:05:12.915]  Just when you think the government couldn't get any more ludicrous, the U.S.
[03:05:12.975 --> 03:05:20.678]  Environmental Protection Agency has taken to social media to point out the harmful effects of sunny days on plant life.
[03:05:20.878 --> 03:05:21.418]  That's right.
[03:05:21.598 --> 03:05:24.699]  The agency tweeted, Think sunny days are good for plants?
[03:05:25.020 --> 03:05:25.660]  Not always.
[03:05:25.940 --> 03:05:30.502]  Sunlight causes ozone to form, which harms foliage and weakens trees.
[03:05:30.962 --> 03:05:36.943]  Makes you wonder how did the planet survive for millennia before a big bloated government came along to protect it?
[03:05:37.243 --> 03:05:48.266]  Let's just point out the absurdity of the EPA highlighting the alleged danger of sunlight as the world is facing numerous legitimate environmental issues, some of which have been caused by the agency itself.
[03:05:48.446 --> 03:05:57.908]  Let's not forget this is the same agency that polluted the Animas River with more than 3 million gallons of toxic waste last month in an effort to cover up that disaster.
[03:05:58.388 --> 03:06:02.492]  EPA officials refuse to provide data to the press on the extent of the damage.
[03:06:02.832 --> 03:06:08.477]  Read the article, Obama's EPA warns sunlight dangerous to plants at InfoWars.com.
[03:06:08.945 --> 03:06:16.091]  Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to be able to bring you the hands-down best deal we've ever offered on high-quality storable foods.

[03:07:08.789 --> 03:07:12.891]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[03:07:13.092 --> 03:07:17.294]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[03:07:17.334 --> 03:07:24.638]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[03:07:24.798 --> 03:07:35.308]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[03:07:35.468 --> 03:07:38.812]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[03:07:38.992 --> 03:07:40.013]  What do you have to lose?
[03:07:40.133 --> 03:07:48.421]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[03:07:48.561 --> 03:07:51.705]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[03:07:51.865 --> 03:07:55.889]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[03:07:56.050 --> 03:07:58.192]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[03:07:58.372 --> 03:08:05.340]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:08:15.359 --> 03:08:15.979]  Big Brother.
[03:08:16.659 --> 03:08:17.680]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:18.440 --> 03:08:19.560]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:20.200 --> 03:08:21.001]  You want answers?
[03:08:21.781 --> 03:08:22.681]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:23.321 --> 03:08:26.922]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:27.503 --> 03:08:31.564]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:34.246 --> 03:08:36.207]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:36.267 --> 03:08:42.132]  You are listening to the 4th Hour Overdrive and I am Leanne McAdoo hosting the show today.
[03:08:42.172 --> 03:08:44.294]  We've got a jam-packed 4th Hour for you.
[03:08:44.695 --> 03:08:47.257]  Joe Biggs will be joining me in studio to wrap up
[03:08:47.857 --> 03:08:54.462]  What went down there at the anti-gun protests, several protesters were arrested, so he's going to update us on that.
[03:08:55.263 --> 03:08:57.744]  I'm also going to be speaking with Tim Donnelly.
[03:08:57.824 --> 03:09:14.517]  He is a former California Assemblyman, also ran for California Governor, and he's going to be coming in to talk about SB 277, which of course is that draconian mandatory vaccine bill that a lot of opponents there in California have really been
[03:09:15.117 --> 03:09:17.138]  Fighting tirelessly to get this overthrown.
[03:09:17.838 --> 03:09:19.859]  He's going to give us an update on that as well.
[03:09:21.059 --> 03:09:25.360]  But first, you know, I kind of wanted to wrap up sort of what we've been talking about here today.
[03:09:25.380 --> 03:09:29.642]  A lot of these stories, some of them seem so far out of left field.
[03:09:30.562 --> 03:09:38.205]  You know, transsexuals wanting you to say, birthing individuals, you can't call yourself a mom or a parent or, you know, that you're pregnant.
[03:09:38.925 --> 03:09:39.465]  Things like that.
[03:09:39.525 --> 03:09:41.246]  They seem so far out of left field.
[03:09:41.826 --> 03:09:44.187]  But we're starting to see authoritarianism
[03:09:45.464 --> 03:09:48.548]  Shifting into totalitarian moves.
[03:09:48.868 --> 03:09:50.190]  And so I wanted to break that down.
[03:09:50.230 --> 03:09:53.794]  There's a very important distinction between the two.
[03:09:54.334 --> 03:09:57.618]  So I want to first start with this clip of Ben Carson.
[03:09:57.978 --> 03:10:00.301]  Now he's getting a lot of flack in the media lately.
[03:10:00.361 --> 03:10:05.667]  He's been speaking out, saying some things that aren't very popular to a lot of people there in the mainstream.
[03:10:06.508 --> 03:10:13.553]  And on Wednesday, he was at a campaign event and he said that he believes a Hitler-type event could happen here.
[03:10:14.294 --> 03:10:21.159]  He says, you know, a lot of people believe a situation like what took place in Germany in the 1930s and 40s could never happen in America.
[03:10:21.679 --> 03:10:22.680]  But he begs to differ.
[03:10:22.980 --> 03:10:32.387]  And he said, you know, if you go back, you look at the history of the world, tyranny and despotism and how it starts, it has a lot to do with control of thought and control of speech.
[03:10:32.627 --> 03:10:35.349]  So let's go ahead and play a portion of what Carson had to say.
[03:10:35.934 --> 03:10:41.118]  In a situation where people do not express themselves, bad things can happen.
[03:10:41.458 --> 03:10:44.761]  That's the main problem that I have with political correctness.
[03:10:45.361 --> 03:10:47.803]  It keeps people from expressing themselves.
[03:10:48.444 --> 03:10:54.708]  And it's the expression, the conversation, that leads to solutions.
[03:10:55.229 --> 03:11:03.135]  Keeping everybody silent while you change the fabric of a society is not what America was supposed to be about.
[03:11:03.991 --> 03:11:05.012]  And that is key.
[03:11:05.312 --> 03:11:09.414]  Keeping everyone silent while you change the fabric of society.
[03:11:09.814 --> 03:11:19.539]  And he goes on to point out that that's exactly what happened with Hitler, and he says, if people don't speak up for what they believe, then other people will change things without them having a voice.
[03:11:20.039 --> 03:11:22.661]  Hitler changed things there, and nobody protested.
[03:11:23.041 --> 03:11:25.322]  Nobody provided any opposition to him.
[03:11:25.722 --> 03:11:28.444]  So of course, that was very powerful, and
[03:11:29.244 --> 03:11:32.407]  Truthful and honest, but you're never allowed to talk about Hitler.
[03:11:32.708 --> 03:11:37.293]  So of course that the reporters there were just like, well, who are you calling Hitler presently?
[03:11:37.353 --> 03:11:38.994]  Are you saying Obama is like Hitler?
[03:11:39.014 --> 03:11:42.478]  And of course he did not allow himself to be baited into that.
[03:11:42.898 --> 03:11:43.739]  He just simply.
[03:11:44.700 --> 03:11:47.921]  Went on to say, I think that this Hitler example is very clear.
[03:11:48.581 --> 03:11:57.945]  Now, let's talk about what's happening presently and sort of come around full circle to how this is like Germany in the 30s and 40s.
[03:11:58.385 --> 03:12:00.666]  So we've got this article up on InfoWars.com.
[03:12:01.306 --> 03:12:05.730]  Trannies want you to say birthing individuals instead of pregnant women.
[03:12:06.190 --> 03:12:25.566]  The phrase pregnant women promotes trans hatred and this is according to some LGBT activists and they have already convinced the Midwives Alliance of North America to stop referring to their clients as women and mothers and instead call them pregnant people and birthing individuals so that transsexuals won't get offended.
[03:12:26.266 --> 03:12:28.127]  Now, I am offended.
[03:12:28.828 --> 03:12:29.888]  What is the problem here?
[03:12:30.109 --> 03:12:31.029]  I want to be a mother.
[03:12:31.189 --> 03:12:43.197]  I want to, you know, be pregnant one day and now I'm going to be offending a very small portion of the population because there's this whole movement out there to reprimand everyone and say, not all women have vaginas.
[03:12:43.217 --> 03:12:45.519]  You know, it's just, it's crazy.
[03:12:45.999 --> 03:12:52.703]  Now, so they have numerous midwives, of course, speaking out against this and calling this an attack on women.
[03:12:53.244 --> 03:12:54.585]  They said in an open letter,
[03:12:55.245 --> 03:13:07.771]  By embracing the idea that any human, other than those in a class called women, carry offspring to term, give birth to them, and nurse them, we are prioritizing gender identity over biological reality.
[03:13:08.371 --> 03:13:12.674]  And that is a very key thing here because we're seeing a lot of this.
[03:13:13.074 --> 03:13:14.875]  Now, I don't want to offend anyone.
[03:13:15.355 --> 03:13:18.236]  I try not to offend people, you know, in my own personal life.
[03:13:18.716 --> 03:13:23.199]  But to actually try and shift the whole fabric of society by
[03:13:24.059 --> 03:13:27.483]  Denying biological reality and, you know, that's an issue.
[03:13:27.884 --> 03:13:29.405]  Then we have another story.
[03:13:29.886 --> 03:13:35.392]  Social Justice Twitters referring to periods as women's issues is transphobic.
[03:13:35.853 --> 03:13:42.360]  And like I said, these people are saying, remember, not all women have vaginas or periods, so you're not allowed to talk about this.
[03:13:43.101 --> 03:13:48.885]  And, you know, a lot of women were taking to Twitter to fight back against Trump when he went on the attack against Megyn Kelly.
[03:13:49.365 --> 03:13:50.445]  And then it backfired.
[03:13:50.786 --> 03:13:53.227]  So once again, an attack on women.
[03:13:53.747 --> 03:13:56.849]  So, you know, feminists aren't speaking up about this.
[03:13:56.909 --> 03:13:58.610]  They're allowing this to happen.
[03:13:58.970 --> 03:14:07.956]  Going back to Carson, curtailing that free speech, curtailing the way people think and the way they have always been taught about gender and all of that.
[03:14:09.113 --> 03:14:11.634]  Now another article up, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:14:12.074 --> 03:14:17.596]  Twitter characterizes disagreeing with someone's opinion as abusive behavior.
[03:14:17.616 --> 03:14:25.279]  And he points out that this is just days after top feminists called on the UN to censor the internet over critical tweets.
[03:14:26.079 --> 03:14:37.343]  So one example of the way Twitter allows you to hold other account holders responsible, you can say, they disagree with my opinion.
[03:14:38.743 --> 03:14:48.570]  So, Twitter posts that are offensive, disrespectful, or in disagreement with my opinion warrant censorship now, can actually get you banned from the site.
[03:14:49.091 --> 03:14:52.013]  It constitutes an act of abuse or harassment.
[03:14:52.173 --> 03:14:57.697]  And this is exactly what these two feminists, Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe Quinn, were speaking at.
[03:14:58.537 --> 03:15:17.363]  At the UN, when they were actively calling for the UN to censor the internet for any content that they deemed to be offensive, which included telling someone, you suck, or calling them a liar, or by calling a transgender person by their original name, like calling Bruce Jenner
[03:15:18.403 --> 03:15:19.444]  Bruce, and not Caitlyn.
[03:15:19.484 --> 03:15:22.105]  So that's offensive, and you know.
[03:15:23.205 --> 03:15:31.829]  So we're already starting to see these people policing thought, and because of what they believe and what they think, they are now actively fighting to censor your First Amendment right.
[03:15:32.329 --> 03:15:34.170]  Your First Amendment right to free speech.
[03:15:34.550 --> 03:15:36.731]  I mean, we saw it out there today at the protest.
[03:15:37.131 --> 03:15:43.494]  The ladies in the pink shirt were filming the two protesters being arrested, and they had this huge smile on their face, and they're like, yeah,
[03:15:43.874 --> 03:15:52.520]  We're going to take away not only your Second Amendment right, but also your First Amendment right, because we don't want you to be able to say anything that we find offensive.
[03:15:52.941 --> 03:15:58.004]  And we're going to tie this all back into this, you know, Germany.
[03:15:58.925 --> 03:16:01.707]  In the 30s, we've got an article on InfoWars.
[03:16:02.027 --> 03:16:05.730]  Did you know America now is similar to 1930s Germany?
[03:16:05.850 --> 03:16:08.192]  And I think that this is a pretty important article.
[03:16:08.212 --> 03:16:09.273]  It's by Illinois Mike.
[03:16:10.367 --> 03:16:19.392]  And he goes on to talk about how prior to the adoption of National Socialism, Germany was essentially a Christian nation.
[03:16:19.973 --> 03:16:22.354]  And it was a very progressive country at the time.
[03:16:22.755 --> 03:16:26.737]  Before the rise of Hitler, it was considered the most socially progressive country in Europe.
[03:16:27.097 --> 03:16:31.260]  They had open homosexuality, transgendered persons were
[03:16:32.220 --> 03:16:33.601]  You know, just lauded.
[03:16:33.641 --> 03:16:35.302]  They had the whole cabaret culture there.
[03:16:35.942 --> 03:16:42.145]  And he said, in fact, the first recorded male-to-female gender reassignment surgery occurred in Berlin in 1931.
[03:16:42.886 --> 03:16:50.830]  So here is a society, much like ours today, where what we would call liberals today were sort of advocating for this, pushing for this.
[03:16:51.170 --> 03:16:56.012]  And because it was a Christian, mostly Christian people, they were tolerant and live and let live.
[03:16:56.052 --> 03:16:56.793]  You do your thing.
[03:16:57.413 --> 03:17:08.475]  But there was kind of this undercurrent where they were feeling like all of this perversion was eating away at the fabric of their society and especially when they started pushing it on children.
[03:17:08.996 --> 03:17:20.738]  So then all of a sudden they've got this tough-talking Hitler coming in, speaking in populist language about restoring the greatness of Germany and knowing that this is exactly what the average citizen wanted to hear.
[03:17:21.218 --> 03:17:24.619]  So one of the first actions that they took to return Germany to greatness
[03:17:25.199 --> 03:17:25.499]  I think?
[03:17:43.684 --> 03:17:47.125]  Burning all sorts of things that challenge the agenda of the Nazi party.
[03:17:47.145 --> 03:17:56.168]  And then the roundups began, where they started purging first gypsies and perverts, but then of course we know where that all took place.
[03:17:57.008 --> 03:18:00.509]  And this article issues a pretty important warning.
[03:18:00.909 --> 03:18:06.851]  As scary as all that is, the rapid and extreme movement in the other direction is what we should be aware of.
[03:18:06.931 --> 03:18:09.832]  We're seeing all this being pushed on us presently in this society.
[03:18:10.852 --> 03:18:20.537]  Um, but they are sort of setting us up for a dictator and this Illinois Mike is saying, let's pay attention to, you know, shifting so far in the opposite direction.
[03:18:21.037 --> 03:18:27.800]  One has to ask themselves if, for instance, the Republican tough guy candidate with populist rhetoric were to be elected.
[03:18:28.180 --> 03:18:35.542]  And he and his get-it-done attitude wanted to round up and deport ethnic and religious minorities like the Hispanics and Muslims?
[03:18:35.982 --> 03:18:39.223]  How many people in today's society would really oppose it?
[03:18:39.603 --> 03:18:41.063]  And then where would it go from there?
[03:18:41.543 --> 03:18:44.924]  How could the voice of reason ever stop it once it starts?
[03:18:45.424 --> 03:18:48.685]  And so that is a very important warning.
[03:18:50.566 --> 03:18:54.528]  And it's basically, you know, I'm going to be getting to this video here in a minute.
[03:18:54.568 --> 03:18:58.249]  I don't think I'm going to have enough time, but I wanted to play the beginning of this video.
[03:18:58.329 --> 03:19:01.910]  What is the difference between authoritarianism and totalitarianism?
[03:19:02.091 --> 03:19:02.971]  Can we go ahead and roll that?
[03:19:05.186 --> 03:19:14.311]  Authoritarians merely want obedience, while totalitarians, whose rule is rooted in an ideology, want obedience and conversion.
[03:19:14.871 --> 03:19:23.715]  The authoritarians are the guys in charge who want to stay in charge, and they don't much care about you or what you're doing, so long as you stay out of their way.
[03:19:24.256 --> 03:19:26.317]  Live or die, it's all same to the regime.
[03:19:27.878 --> 03:19:30.078]  Totalitarians are a different breed.
[03:19:30.659 --> 03:19:40.361]  These are the people who have a plan, who think they see the future more clearly than you, or who are convinced they grasp reality in a way that you do not.
[03:19:40.381 --> 03:19:50.743]  They don't serve themselves, they serve history, or the people, or the idea, or some other ideological totem that justifies their actions.
[03:19:51.423 --> 03:19:53.024]  They want obedience, of course.
[03:19:53.504 --> 03:19:59.648]  But even more, they want their rule and their belief system to be accepted and self-sustaining.
[03:20:00.128 --> 03:20:05.452]  And the only way to achieve that is to create a new society of people who share those beliefs.
[03:20:05.812 --> 03:20:09.174]  Even if it means bludgeoning every last citizen into enlightenment.
[03:20:09.654 --> 03:20:20.220]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens that often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.
[03:20:20.720 --> 03:20:24.482]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[03:23:08.658 --> 03:23:12.882]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[03:23:13.082 --> 03:23:16.965]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[03:23:17.145 --> 03:23:21.449]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[03:23:24.491 --> 03:23:29.514]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?

[03:23:41.561 --> 03:23:41.841]  I think so.
[03:24:19.252 --> 03:24:20.934]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:20.974 --> 03:24:23.656]  You're listening to the 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:24:23.797 --> 03:24:24.778]  I am Leanne McAdoo.
[03:24:25.118 --> 03:24:34.427]  Now, right before the break, I played a portion of a clip, Authoritarianism vs. Totalitarian, and that was just kind of an excerpt that I did.
[03:24:35.498 --> 03:24:35.698]  Of course!
[03:24:56.005 --> 03:24:57.727]  Are the new totalitarians here?
[03:24:58.208 --> 03:25:06.117]  You were there at the protest where people were trying to take away not only that Second Amendment right, but also people's First Amendment rights to protest.
[03:25:06.497 --> 03:25:07.538]  It was like Nazi Germany.
[03:25:07.578 --> 03:25:09.360]  I mean, I've been to protests so many times.
[03:25:09.380 --> 03:25:10.201]  This is the first time.
[03:25:10.902 --> 03:25:11.082]  I don't
[03:25:29.159 --> 03:25:32.861]  I'm open up to discussion amongst other ones who are out here, you know, like-minded like me.
[03:25:33.301 --> 03:25:38.664]  But, you know, if you have anything that, you know, doesn't fit our narrative, then we're not going to talk.
[03:25:38.684 --> 03:25:42.846]  Not one, actually one person, one person with a gun-free U.T.
[03:25:42.866 --> 03:25:44.187]  shirt wouldn't even speak to me.
[03:25:44.587 --> 03:25:45.128]  The other one's like...
[03:25:46.088 --> 03:25:46.308]  No.
[03:25:46.729 --> 03:25:46.949]  Right.
[03:25:47.189 --> 03:25:49.151]  I don't want to talk to you about anything.
[03:25:49.171 --> 03:25:52.093]  You guys are gun nuts, you know, the entire time.
[03:25:52.593 --> 03:25:59.218]  There was someone who was walking around on the stage looking for anti-gun or pro-gun signs.
[03:25:59.258 --> 03:26:02.081]  If you had a pro-gun sign, they called the cops and came over you.
[03:26:02.301 --> 03:26:06.104]  They arrested two people today for standing there with a sign.
[03:26:07.204 --> 03:26:08.685]  You don't need a permit.
[03:26:08.805 --> 03:26:10.845]  You don't need a permit for the First Amendment.
[03:26:11.126 --> 03:26:12.486]  That is your permit.
[03:26:12.566 --> 03:26:12.886]  Right.
[03:26:13.106 --> 03:26:15.067]  The First Amendment guarantees you that.
[03:26:15.107 --> 03:26:16.167]  That's the Constitution.
[03:26:16.327 --> 03:26:16.587]  Right.
[03:26:17.328 --> 03:26:30.272]  Well, and I think this article might be from guns.com where they're talking about this forum on campus, Carrie, and there's a picture, if you can see, on the dot cam, the lady, the back of her shirt, she's armed with reason.
[03:26:30.732 --> 03:26:38.324]  And that's their argument, is that they're the smart ones, they know everything, and people who want to support the Second Amendment do not know.
[03:26:38.564 --> 03:26:40.347]  So I guess... They're armed with reason.
[03:26:40.367 --> 03:26:42.971]  I wonder how many people in Oregon were armed with reason.
[03:26:44.042 --> 03:26:47.145]  You got 15 people dead right now in Oregon, maybe 12.
[03:26:47.185 --> 03:26:48.927]  They're saying the numbers keep changing, 12 to 15.
[03:26:49.047 --> 03:26:52.330]  I think 20 people shot altogether, but that many people dead.
[03:26:52.350 --> 03:26:53.772]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[03:26:54.252 --> 03:26:59.778]  Think what would happen if we stopped making our colleges, places like this, soft targets.
[03:27:00.258 --> 03:27:02.441]  People think that when we make all these gun laws,
[03:27:03.530 --> 03:27:05.171]  That there's not going to be any guns on campus.
[03:27:05.251 --> 03:27:05.571]  Guess what?
[03:27:05.591 --> 03:27:08.613]  The reason criminals are criminals is because they don't follow laws.
[03:27:08.653 --> 03:27:09.294]  They break them.
[03:27:09.554 --> 03:27:09.794]  Right.
[03:27:09.834 --> 03:27:12.456]  So once everyone's disarmed, guess who will have the guns?
[03:27:12.976 --> 03:27:14.697]  The police, who aren't highly trained.
[03:27:15.058 --> 03:27:16.399]  Some of them are, but a lot aren't.
[03:27:16.759 --> 03:27:17.379]  And then criminals.
[03:27:18.020 --> 03:27:22.803]  The argument at the UT campus today was we think that only police should have weapons.
[03:27:23.103 --> 03:27:26.065]  So I started going, well, OK, because police are highly trained.
[03:27:26.085 --> 03:27:27.146]  Have you ever heard of Kelly Thomas?
[03:27:27.166 --> 03:27:29.247]  Have you ever heard about Sam DuBose?
[03:27:29.267 --> 03:27:33.310]  You've heard about these different people who were killed by highly trained officers who guess what?
[03:27:34.050 --> 03:27:39.213]  Well, let's be, I mean, let's be real.
[03:27:39.253 --> 03:27:43.636]  Like, the new guys get about six months of training, essentially, to get a license to kill.
[03:27:43.656 --> 03:27:44.637]  I mean, that's it.
[03:27:44.677 --> 03:27:48.259]  So you got six months of training and now you leave.
[03:27:48.499 --> 03:27:54.903]  It took me years to be able to hone the skills that I had to go out there and to walk around freely and not feel like I needed to.
[03:27:55.723 --> 03:27:57.244]  To be like this when I was in combat.
[03:27:57.284 --> 03:27:58.805]  I mean, it takes time to do that.
[03:27:59.125 --> 03:28:04.928]  And you give this guy a gun and a badge and you throw him in there and think, oh, well, automatically he's going to have our best interests in mind.
[03:28:04.948 --> 03:28:05.929]  He's going to make the right decision.
[03:28:05.969 --> 03:28:06.989]  That's not always going to be the case.
[03:28:07.410 --> 03:28:12.692]  People need to be able to have that right to protect themselves because when seconds count, it takes minutes for police to arrive.
[03:28:12.993 --> 03:28:15.294]  By the time those cops showed up today in Oregon, what happened?
[03:28:15.514 --> 03:28:17.255]  There was already a body count.
[03:28:17.675 --> 03:28:24.459]  Those numbers can dissipate and go down if you actually have people on campus who can carry and fight that threat.
[03:28:24.699 --> 03:28:28.341]  Or not, you know, leaving them as sitting ducks, so to speak.
[03:28:28.401 --> 03:28:29.642]  Well, people think automatically.
[03:28:29.702 --> 03:28:34.325]  Well, if you bring the guns on campus, then that type of stuff is going to be happening all the time.
[03:28:34.425 --> 03:28:41.609]  Well, people think that if it's open carry on campus, campus carry, I mean, which has already been passed, is going to be, you know, going into effect next year in August.
[03:28:41.929 --> 03:28:43.710]  But people think that everyone's going to be running and gunning.
[03:28:43.730 --> 03:28:44.731]  Like, it's going to be a wild west.
[03:28:44.751 --> 03:28:46.672]  Like, everyone's going to be like, ooh, look at my gun, look at my gun.
[03:28:46.992 --> 03:28:48.033]  No, it's concealed carry.
[03:28:48.313 --> 03:28:49.153]  You're not even going to know.
[03:28:49.194 --> 03:28:51.315]  There were people in the protest today that had guns on them.
[03:28:52.065 --> 03:28:52.385]  Legally.
[03:28:52.866 --> 03:28:53.426]  No one even knew.
[03:28:53.446 --> 03:28:56.288]  No one attacked them and went after them or were scared.
[03:28:56.688 --> 03:28:57.669]  No one even knew they had them.
[03:28:58.529 --> 03:28:59.450]  They were concealed.
[03:28:59.750 --> 03:29:00.110]  Right.
[03:29:00.151 --> 03:29:00.691]  And guess what?
[03:29:00.911 --> 03:29:01.952]  Responsible gun owners.
[03:29:02.132 --> 03:29:03.933]  In Texas, you have to be 21.
[03:29:04.253 --> 03:29:07.475]  Most of the kids I talked to today that were anti-gun, guess what, they were 18 to 20.
[03:29:08.116 --> 03:29:11.798]  You can't even carry anyway, so really your opinion doesn't even matter in this.
[03:29:11.878 --> 03:29:16.942]  You're taking away the rights and the ability for someone who would be old enough and legally able to do it.
[03:29:17.462 --> 03:29:19.703]  I mean, it's ridiculous anyways that we have a law anyways.
[03:29:19.743 --> 03:29:21.383]  I think anybody should be able to carry wherever they want.
[03:29:21.924 --> 03:29:26.825]  But we do have the law, so with that in mind, you're taking away from those people's rights.
[03:29:26.845 --> 03:29:28.566]  There's not that many people who are 21 and up.
[03:29:29.926 --> 03:29:30.647]  It's out of control.
[03:29:30.667 --> 03:29:31.767]  They want to deny that.
[03:29:32.207 --> 03:29:33.227]  One in five women are raped.
[03:29:33.528 --> 03:29:35.528]  Where are those people at that care about that?
[03:29:35.808 --> 03:29:37.049]  Let those women protect themselves.
[03:29:37.269 --> 03:29:37.509]  Right.
[03:29:37.629 --> 03:29:43.271]  And it will be interesting to see what happens with the two guys out there that were arrested, I guess, two protesters.
[03:29:44.171 --> 03:29:45.032]  Well, awesome.
[03:29:45.052 --> 03:29:47.815]  So I guess you're gonna be coming back in later in the show.
[03:29:47.855 --> 03:29:54.842]  Kit Daniels, give us his rundown on exactly what went on out there at the anti-campus carry rally.
[03:29:54.982 --> 03:29:57.524]  Of course, no one once again wanted to talk to you.
[03:29:58.525 --> 03:29:59.406]  We're on the march.
[03:29:59.907 --> 03:30:01.508]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:30:01.528 --> 03:30:05.132]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.864 --> 03:30:12.307]  Have you waited your whole life to become a mother?
[03:30:12.607 --> 03:30:15.710]  Well, you're probably a racist, sexist, homophobe.
[03:30:16.071 --> 03:30:29.965]  LGBT activists have already convinced the Midwives Alliance of North America to stop referring to their clients as women and mothers, and instead call them pregnant people and birthing individuals, so transsexuals won't get offended.
[03:30:30.666 --> 03:30:35.290]  Numerous midwives have protested this language change, calling it an attack on women.
[03:30:35.651 --> 03:30:50.024]  In an open letter, they say, by embracing the idea that any human, other than those in a class called women, can carry offspring to term, give birth to them, and nurse them, we are prioritizing gender identity over biological reality.
[03:30:50.664 --> 03:30:56.150]  Obviously this ideology contributes to the cultural erasure of women's unique power to give birth.
[03:30:56.611 --> 03:30:58.813]  It is encoded in our female bodies.
[03:30:59.114 --> 03:31:02.858]  That's what creates, nourishes, and births live offspring.
[03:31:03.358 --> 03:31:05.741]  For more reports, visit InfoWars.com.
[03:31:09.269 --> 03:31:10.510]  Another major health threat.
[03:31:10.530 --> 03:31:15.432]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[03:31:15.512 --> 03:31:18.133]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[03:31:18.173 --> 03:31:24.956]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[03:31:25.216 --> 03:31:28.077]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[03:31:28.197 --> 03:31:31.139]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[03:31:31.159 --> 03:31:33.140]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[03:31:33.180 --> 03:31:36.001]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[03:31:36.101 --> 03:31:41.625]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[03:31:41.825 --> 03:31:45.308]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[03:31:45.328 --> 03:31:48.310]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[03:31:48.430 --> 03:31:52.713]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.

[03:33:05.788 --> 03:33:17.959]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:33:18.559 --> 03:33:21.542]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:28.280 --> 03:33:29.921]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:29.961 --> 03:33:33.442]  This is the 4th Hour Overdrive and I am Leanne McAdoo.
[03:33:33.782 --> 03:33:37.643]  Now I'm going to be speaking with the guest today about SB 277.
[03:33:38.044 --> 03:33:40.625]  Now this is the mandatory vaccine bill.
[03:33:41.165 --> 03:33:46.607]  It says that parents are no longer allowed to have personal belief exemptions.
[03:33:47.567 --> 03:33:52.549]  Children, if they gotta go to public school, even some private schools there, they must be vaccinated.
[03:33:52.589 --> 03:33:57.131]  The only way to not have to vaccinate your child is to keep them out of school entirely.
[03:33:57.171 --> 03:33:59.412]  You have to homeschool them now in California.
[03:34:00.072 --> 03:34:02.092]  So, Tim Donnelly is a politician.
[03:34:02.153 --> 03:34:06.174]  He is a Republican member of the California State Assembly in 2010.
[03:34:06.334 --> 03:34:07.354]  He was re-elected in 2012.
[03:34:07.394 --> 03:34:11.256]  Donnelly was also a candidate for the California
[03:34:11.876 --> 03:34:16.638]  For California governor in 2014 he placed third in that open primary.
[03:34:17.539 --> 03:34:23.962]  He's also a radio talk show host on Radio Free California and it's the timdonnellyshow.com.
[03:34:24.462 --> 03:34:26.723]  So welcome Mr. Donnelly to the show.
[03:34:26.783 --> 03:34:29.104]  Now what's going on with SB 277?
[03:34:29.984 --> 03:34:35.627]  I know that there was a massive push to get some signatures to oppose this bill.
[03:34:37.862 --> 03:34:40.784]  Yes, that is correct, and thank you for having me on.
[03:34:41.605 --> 03:35:02.440]  We've been working tirelessly, when I say we, myself and thousands of Californians who are concerned about this egregious assault on not just parents' rights, but natural rights, human rights, the right to decide what you inject in your own body or your child's body.
[03:35:02.460 --> 03:35:06.083]  And in that time frame,
[03:35:06.957 --> 03:35:18.944]  We have educated an incredible number of people and created a grassroots movement that is hitting full stride now.
[03:35:19.084 --> 03:35:20.905]  The signature gathering is over.
[03:35:21.245 --> 03:35:33.873]  The signatures have been turned in to the registrar of voters in all of the 58 counties in California, and we are waiting for their final tally on them.
[03:35:34.668 --> 03:35:36.429]  Okay, so the final tally hasn't come in.
[03:35:36.449 --> 03:35:38.389]  I know that there was a little bit of discrepancy there.
[03:35:38.469 --> 03:35:42.670]  The LA Times was reporting that it's over, it's done, there weren't enough votes.
[03:35:43.271 --> 03:35:47.352]  Some people are saying, you know, was there a little bit of sabotage involved?
[03:35:47.732 --> 03:35:49.252]  Thousands of signatures are missing.
[03:35:49.272 --> 03:35:51.953]  So there's a little bit of a discrepancy there with these votes.
[03:35:52.453 --> 03:35:58.335]  And as well, I know you talked about facing some strong opposition from the pharmaceutical lobby as well.
[03:35:59.210 --> 03:36:18.795]  Well, we certainly have seen a tremendous amount of opposition, and we've even experienced it undermining, within the movement itself, individuals who purported to be in favor of our viewpoint, you know, wound up undermining much of what we were doing.
[03:36:18.815 --> 03:36:27.797]  And I've never really seen it this strong, and I think it has to do with the amount of money that's involved.
[03:36:30.763 --> 03:36:37.758]  Hundreds of billions of dollars when it comes to the pharmaceutical industry, at least in the United States.
[03:36:38.584 --> 03:36:47.609]  Right, yeah, and we have actually seen a lot of the pharmaceutical lobby there behind some of the people responsible for getting SB 277 passed.
[03:36:47.689 --> 03:36:52.112]  So obviously a lot of money propping those sort of people up as well.
[03:36:52.712 --> 03:37:03.759]  Now, I know you're saying that your voices have been heard and you're not going anywhere, so what can people do from here if there aren't enough votes at this point?
[03:37:04.693 --> 03:37:08.515]  Well, if there's not enough signatures, then obviously it won't qualify for the ballot.
[03:37:08.755 --> 03:37:16.779]  And that'll be a massive disappointment to all of those who were hopeful that it would ultimately qualify.
[03:37:17.960 --> 03:37:24.203]  But look, if the fight doesn't end, the next step would naturally be lawsuits.
[03:37:24.423 --> 03:37:26.544]  Because when you look at what SB 277 does,
[03:37:28.999 --> 03:37:33.866]  It dangles, it actually holds your child's educational future hostage.
[03:37:34.346 --> 03:37:44.541]  It kicks your child out of every public setting for education, be it public school, private school, charter schools, or even daycare.
[03:37:45.938 --> 03:38:05.884]  And in some homeschooling environment, where the Homeschoolers Association has a relationship with the public school to come in and, or I'm sorry, with the charter school, to come in and do some sort of a public activity that involves hanging around with other kids, your kid would be ostracized and forbidden to attend that.
[03:38:06.484 --> 03:38:07.364]  And what's their crime?
[03:38:07.484 --> 03:38:09.305]  Maybe missing one single booster shot.
[03:38:10.616 --> 03:38:12.038]  That's literally what we're doing here.
[03:38:12.738 --> 03:38:23.608]  And the government is forcing, coercing, and intimidating parents into going against their own personal beliefs, or religious beliefs, or their conscience.
[03:38:25.189 --> 03:38:28.452]  And they're doing it in the name of a health crisis that doesn't exist.
[03:38:29.488 --> 03:38:29.748]  Right.
[03:38:30.268 --> 03:38:41.271]  Well, I mean, they're basically saying that their vaccinated children are getting sick by unvaccinated children, which then why are you even getting vaccines if they're clearly not working?
[03:38:41.331 --> 03:38:43.471]  Their whole argument doesn't even make sense.
[03:38:44.031 --> 03:38:45.632]  So what are... Go ahead.
[03:38:45.672 --> 03:38:50.053]  When you start to ask people questions like that, they get really mad.
[03:38:50.153 --> 03:38:50.473]  They do.
[03:38:50.493 --> 03:38:52.193]  It's kind of funny.
[03:38:52.253 --> 03:38:54.634]  So you take the CDC's own report
[03:38:56.930 --> 03:39:00.353]  On the so-called measles outbreak at Disneyland.
[03:39:00.733 --> 03:39:03.296]  The CDC claims that they wiped out measles back in 2000 or 2003.
[03:39:03.356 --> 03:39:06.598]  There hasn't been a death since 2003.
[03:39:07.479 --> 03:39:16.847]  And yet this little measles outbreak at Disneyland, which happened in 2014, was used as an excuse
[03:39:17.722 --> 03:39:23.364]  To target and scapegoat those who have chosen to either not vaccinate or selectively vaccinate their children.
[03:39:23.905 --> 03:39:27.586]  And they represent a very, very small part of the population.
[03:39:28.106 --> 03:39:33.949]  They tend to be much more knowledgeable about their health and healthcare issues in general.
[03:39:34.829 --> 03:39:45.494]  And what's fascinating is when you read the CDC's website, they've identified the original patient as most likely being a foreign visitor to the U.S.
[03:39:46.607 --> 03:40:06.868]  So someone came here and reintroduced measles in the United States and they've gone after a completely different group of people, even though when you look at the rest of the results and the information on their website, people who were vaccinated and people who were not vaccinated and people whose vaccination status were unknown contracted and spread the disease.
[03:40:10.188 --> 03:40:21.534]  Right and something I did a report on this I guess I forget the young guy's name that they were kind of parading around and he was sort of the poster child for this SB 277.
[03:40:21.995 --> 03:40:31.080]  He was getting chemo treatments and basically saying don't bring your unvaccinated kid to school and make someone like me that's you know has a failing immune system
[03:40:32.180 --> 03:41:00.158]  susceptible to those viruses when if you go to the John Hopkins site or another one of these children's hospitals it specifically used to say right before they were trying to pass SB 277 to avoid contact with the recently vaccinated that it was those recently vaccinated children that were actually going to be the more dangerous ones that could possibly pass along a virus and they changed that manual that they would give to
[03:41:00.638 --> 03:41:09.022]  People receiving cancer treatment to fit this ideology here with SB 277, which I... That doesn't surprise me.
[03:41:09.322 --> 03:41:10.402]  I mean, that was fascinating.
[03:41:12.723 --> 03:41:25.449]  When the powers that be decide they want to push a narrative, when they have the media compliant, and they have terrified the media into not reporting on anything to do with vaccine side effects,
[03:41:26.449 --> 03:41:34.957]  So the buzzword is safe and effective, even though the Supreme Court has said that they're unavoidably unsafe.
[03:41:36.178 --> 03:41:51.612]  And the Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund that is actually run by the government, funded by your tax dollars and my tax dollars, has paid out over $3 billion in injuries for a product that's supposed to be safe and effective.
[03:41:52.623 --> 03:42:19.277]  So obviously something's wrong and and and when you when you start to ask questions it's it's funny people who don't trust the government on anything else all of a sudden with the sacred cow of vaccinations they become mind-numb zombies and it's like oh the government knows all the government is we we must trust the government we must protect public health
[03:42:19.910 --> 03:42:20.130]  Right.
[03:42:52.182 --> 03:43:03.356]  Yeah, absolutely, and you're not allowed to think anything other than what science tells us, even though we've got reports where they're admittedly using junk science.
[03:43:04.659 --> 03:43:15.947]  To prop up these huge corporations, like Coca-Cola, for instance, was just found to be paid, bought and paid for scientists who would find the results that would favor their company.
[03:43:16.448 --> 03:43:17.929]  What's going on there in California?
[03:43:18.029 --> 03:43:20.671]  I mean, they are really occupied territory.
[03:43:21.792 --> 03:43:31.499]  Just, I guess, in 2013, Adan, our writer, said he first became aware of you after that case where a child was abducted by CPS
[03:43:32.119 --> 03:43:36.002]  After the parents dared to seek a second opinion.
[03:43:36.022 --> 03:43:47.130]  The parents were there in the hospital and they were concerned with the care they were receiving for their child after a nurse failed to properly address why the child was being given antibiotics.
[03:43:47.150 --> 03:43:51.733]  So the parents wanted to maybe go get a second opinion and CPS snatched them from their home.
[03:43:52.573 --> 03:43:53.354]  So I mean... Yeah.
[03:43:53.874 --> 03:43:54.235]  Yeah.
[03:43:54.315 --> 03:44:00.019]  Well, and it was fascinating because the mother, the only thing she was guilty of was loving her child too much.
[03:44:00.439 --> 03:44:01.780]  She had a mother's instinct.
[03:44:02.515 --> 03:44:07.178]  That she was going to be handed back a dead baby because they wanted to do open-heart surgery on him today.
[03:44:08.019 --> 03:44:14.903]  And she wasn't even comfortable with the fact they had administered antibiotics without consulting her and getting her consent.
[03:44:15.004 --> 03:44:28.933]  Her son, who was about six months old, who did have a congenital heart defect that was going to require surgery at some point, but he was running a fever and she didn't want him going in for surgery when he didn't have the best chance of survival.
[03:44:29.750 --> 03:44:36.435]  So, she just went into protective mode, grabbed her child, left, and they threatened her to send CPS.
[03:44:36.455 --> 03:44:39.558]  They said, you can leave, but your child can't.
[03:44:40.158 --> 03:44:43.361]  And she said, you know, to heck with you guys, and walked out the door.
[03:44:44.482 --> 03:44:45.783]  Well, she went to another hospital.
[03:44:45.883 --> 03:44:48.325]  She didn't go, you know, shoot up intravenous drugs.
[03:44:48.485 --> 03:44:50.167]  She didn't go to a bar and get drunk.
[03:44:50.527 --> 03:44:51.528]  She went to a hospital.
[03:44:51.588 --> 03:44:57.472]  She got a referral for surgery within the next three weeks, and they sent a cop after her.
[03:44:57.833 --> 03:44:59.174]  The cop showed up and said, hey,
[03:45:00.086 --> 03:45:01.587]  No crime here, for crying out loud.
[03:45:01.607 --> 03:45:04.850]  The woman's done everything she's supposed to, you know, go pound sand.
[03:45:04.870 --> 03:45:05.871]  Right.
[03:45:05.911 --> 03:45:08.934]  Well, the doctors in the hospital didn't like being questioned.
[03:45:09.975 --> 03:45:15.199]  So they sent CPS to her home the next day.
[03:45:15.219 --> 03:45:20.524]  And this is a woman who immigrated to this country from Germany, and her husband came from Russia.
[03:45:20.544 --> 03:45:26.589]  So both of them come from places where the government, you know, a knock on the door often means people disappear.
[03:45:27.609 --> 03:45:29.250]  And there was a pounding at the door.
[03:45:29.290 --> 03:45:34.954]  There were five police officers, and she asked to see the warrant, and they said, no, we won't show it to you until you open the door.
[03:45:35.575 --> 03:45:36.736]  Well, she refused to open the door.
[03:45:37.676 --> 03:45:39.618]  So, she went upstairs, she called her husband.
[03:45:40.218 --> 03:45:48.384]  As he was coming home from work, they tackled him in the walkway, on the porch, took the keys out of his pocket, and broke into her home.
[03:45:49.625 --> 03:45:54.509]  And it's all legal, because CPS, you know... Yeah, they're all knowing.
[03:45:54.709 --> 03:45:56.150]  Right, your kids belong with the state.
[03:45:57.130 --> 03:46:16.097]  She was smart enough to put a video camera on a tripod, and you could watch five cops walk in, hands on their guns, like they're going to encounter some, you know, major resistance from this tiny, petite little woman, and all she's doing is holding her child.
[03:46:17.501 --> 03:46:24.324]  And they proceed to berate her and never give her any time to read any of the documentation.
[03:46:24.645 --> 03:46:33.729]  And eventually, they just threaten her and say, look, if you don't give us the child, we're going to grab him out of your hands and you're going to go to jail for resisting arrest.
[03:46:33.949 --> 03:46:39.012]  And ultimately, she handed over her child and then she begged to know where he was going.
[03:46:39.432 --> 03:46:44.774]  And the social worker turned around, stuck her finger in her face and said, you don't get to know because you're acting irrational.
[03:46:44.794 --> 03:46:45.175]  Wow.
[03:46:46.477 --> 03:46:51.281]  And then the government took the child back to the exact same hospital the parents had lost confidence in.
[03:46:51.841 --> 03:46:52.121]  Wow.
[03:46:52.361 --> 03:46:53.462]  And that is so incredible.
[03:46:53.482 --> 03:46:56.765]  I mean, the right to choose what's best for your children is at risk here.
[03:46:56.805 --> 03:47:01.308]  We're seeing this not only with this case, but of course these mandatory forced vaccinations.
[03:47:01.989 --> 03:47:03.590]  Tim Donnelly, thank you so much for joining us.
[03:47:03.630 --> 03:47:06.172]  Now, where can people go for more information?
[03:47:06.212 --> 03:47:11.936]  Because I know you're going to be staying abreast of this, giving people kind of breaking news on this topic.
[03:47:13.066 --> 03:47:19.492]  Sure, they can find us at SB 277 Referendum on Facebook.
[03:47:19.972 --> 03:47:24.236]  They can also just come to my page, Tim Donnelly, or timdonnellyshow.com.
[03:47:24.937 --> 03:47:27.459]  We'll have information on all those places, and you can reach out.
[03:47:28.180 --> 03:47:29.701]  And I want to thank you for having me on.
[03:47:29.721 --> 03:47:35.786]  Thank you for covering this important issue, because the bottom line is this is not about vaccination.
[03:47:35.967 --> 03:47:37.268]  It's about government control.
[03:47:37.978 --> 03:47:49.394]  Coercion and intimidation and the stripping away of a basic fundamental freedom that is guaranteed and is supposed to be protected by the government not put at risk.
[03:47:50.160 --> 03:47:50.820]  Absolutely.
[03:47:50.960 --> 03:47:51.661]  Thank you so much.
[03:47:51.721 --> 03:47:52.561]  And that is the point.
[03:47:52.621 --> 03:48:05.928]  If people don't speak up now, when you start to see this totalitarian hand coming down on you, that boot on your neck, then who is going to speak out when it gets, you know, when it takes an aggressive turn?
[03:48:06.288 --> 03:48:07.789]  And it really is sort of ramping up.
[03:48:07.989 --> 03:48:08.249]  Wow.
[03:48:08.329 --> 03:48:11.150]  Tim Donnelly, hopefully we'll be able to get him back on for the nightly news.
[03:48:11.631 --> 03:48:12.691]  Update us on this SB 277.
[03:48:14.392 --> 03:48:20.833]  Now, shifting gears here, InfoWars has an article up here, Media Caught Distorting President Putin's Speech.
[03:48:21.314 --> 03:48:27.275]  InfoWars, we went ahead and analyzed the translation of the speech and, of course, revealed some crucial information.
[03:48:27.295 --> 03:48:36.417]  I'm going to play a little snippet of this video for you right now so you can kind of get the gist of just what was distorted in the President Putin's speech.
[03:48:37.870 --> 03:48:43.174]  Hi there, my name is Daria and I have recently started working here at Infowars.com.
[03:48:43.774 --> 03:48:52.961]  A little bit about me, I came to the United States from Russia when I was a teenager, so I speak Russian pretty well, pretty fluently.
[03:48:53.621 --> 03:49:00.745]  So today on the show Alex played a clip from Putin's UN speech and I noticed some of the discrepancies in the translation.
[03:49:01.105 --> 03:49:07.129]  And as we all know, mainstream media tends to manipulate the messages of foreign leaders when they speak.
[03:49:07.489 --> 03:49:14.873]  So I really wanted to get down to it and really take a listen and see if there were any manipulations that happened.
[03:49:15.273 --> 03:49:16.174]  So let's take a look.
[03:49:17.848 --> 03:49:23.430]  It seems, however, that far from learning from others' mistakes, everyone just keeps repeating them.
[03:49:24.190 --> 03:49:40.235]  So the start of the sentence may be a little bit confusing because we're missing the previous passage, in which Putin talks about how, in the past, meddling in other countries' affairs has not led to any progress.
[03:49:40.595 --> 03:49:42.997]  But instead to destruction of that country.
[03:49:43.017 --> 03:49:45.878]  Okay, now I'm going to go ahead and bring that report down now.
[03:49:45.918 --> 03:49:51.202]  That is one of our new employees, Daria, and she was analyzing the translation of this speech.
[03:49:51.302 --> 03:49:52.523]  You can go to the site.
[03:49:53.883 --> 03:50:02.769]  The article is media caught distorting President Putin's speech and the video itself in its entirety, deceptive translation of Putin revealed.
[03:50:03.209 --> 03:50:05.251]  And that, of course, is on the Alex Jones Channel.
[03:50:05.771 --> 03:50:08.813]  Joining me in studio now is our writer, Kit Daniels.
[03:50:08.913 --> 03:50:15.378]  Now, Kit, you're going to stay with me through this next break, but tell me, what went on today at this protest?
[03:50:15.938 --> 03:50:26.726]  Well, I think the whole gun control movement, especially at UT Austin, it's a good microcosm of how the establishment is using mass media to control the population through manufactured consent.
[03:50:27.580 --> 03:50:31.401]  I mean, the gun rights supporters that were there, none of them were in any sort of a movement.
[03:50:31.441 --> 03:50:36.242]  They were just kind of guys that are, you know, construction workers or guys that work, you know, auto mechanics.
[03:50:36.262 --> 03:50:40.123]  They just show up there to support their basic freedoms, their basic rights.
[03:50:40.423 --> 03:50:41.203]  How dare they?
[03:50:41.343 --> 03:50:42.123]  Yeah, how dare they?
[03:50:43.083 --> 03:50:45.844]  So let's talk a little bit more about that on this other side of the break.
[03:50:46.304 --> 03:50:49.445]  No, and that's the thing is now is the time to be speaking up.
[03:50:49.545 --> 03:50:51.625]  They are trying to drop the hammer.
[03:50:51.825 --> 03:50:55.246]  So you've got to get out to these protests and speak up, fight for your rights.
[03:50:56.618 --> 03:50:57.239]  My goodness.
[03:50:59.060 --> 03:51:00.942]  Yeah, if you don't speak up, no one else is going to.
[03:51:01.082 --> 03:51:01.542]  Absolutely.
[03:51:01.562 --> 03:51:02.783]  No one will be around to oppose it.
[03:51:15.051 --> 03:51:16.954]  Hey neighbor, what are you doing digging?
[03:51:17.114 --> 03:51:18.817]  You had a heart attack last year.
[03:51:18.837 --> 03:51:20.059]  Oh, I know.
[03:51:20.319 --> 03:51:21.641]  I was told no more hard labor.
[03:51:22.222 --> 03:51:23.323]  Then why are you digging?
[03:51:23.804 --> 03:51:25.146]  Well, I've been taking extendovite.
[03:51:25.667 --> 03:51:26.889]  It's been approved to help my heart.
[03:51:27.410 --> 03:51:28.291]  Extendovite?
[03:51:28.471 --> 03:51:29.352]  Is that a new drug?
[03:51:30.188 --> 03:51:30.949]  No, not a drug.
[03:51:31.549 --> 03:51:34.873]  It's more like an herbal combination made from garlic and cayenne.
[03:51:35.373 --> 03:51:35.854]  Herbal?
[03:51:36.014 --> 03:51:36.895]  How can that help?
[03:51:37.516 --> 03:51:41.620]  Well, actually, we've taken herbs for thousands of years, and Xtendivite is doing the job for me.
[03:51:42.120 --> 03:51:44.183]  Does your doctor know about Xtendivite?
[03:51:44.723 --> 03:51:48.307]  Yeah, my doctor knows, and he said it seems to be working for you, so don't stop taking it.
[03:51:48.587 --> 03:51:50.028]  I feel great taking Xtendivite.
[03:51:50.348 --> 03:51:51.108]  I don't want to stop.
[03:51:51.508 --> 03:51:52.728]  To order, call 1-877-928-8822.

[03:52:09.158 --> 03:52:12.940]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[03:52:13.240 --> 03:52:23.545]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[03:52:23.685 --> 03:52:26.606]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[03:52:26.766 --> 03:52:35.515]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the pure deep earth crystals and have now been able to produce more survival shield nascent iodine X2.
[03:52:35.555 --> 03:52:37.317]  This is the good halogen.
[03:52:37.417 --> 03:52:40.160]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[03:52:40.480 --> 03:52:42.222]  Now we at Infowarslife.com.

[03:53:28.599 --> 03:53:31.820]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.

[03:54:20.103 --> 03:54:21.784]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:21.824 --> 03:54:24.625]  We are wrapping up the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:54:24.665 --> 03:54:27.186]  Joining me now, Kit Daniels and Jakari Jackson.
[03:54:27.666 --> 03:54:33.088]  Now, Jakari, you saw what was going on there at the protest at UT and you were like, I gotta get out there now.
[03:54:33.268 --> 03:54:35.809]  What was it that spurred you to head out?
[03:54:36.365 --> 03:54:42.130]  Well, you know, I'm doing the nightly news coming up where we'll be talking about this and a whole lot more talking about some Russia stuff as well.
[03:54:42.450 --> 03:54:44.892]  But, you know, I've been to numerous of these events.
[03:54:44.972 --> 03:54:47.113]  I've seen people arrested for carrying real guns.
[03:54:47.173 --> 03:54:49.355]  I've seen people arrested for carrying toy guns.
[03:54:49.755 --> 03:54:52.718]  This is the first time I ever saw somebody arrested for holding a sign.
[03:54:53.118 --> 03:55:08.086]  Which goes way beyond the Second Amendment and actually makes it a First Amendment issue to say that at a public university that you need a permit to stand with a sign in a designated space is completely ridiculous and a downright overreach by the authority.
[03:55:09.006 --> 03:55:17.171]  Yeah, like I told a campus official there, it's like, okay, if you want me to go get a permit, that's fine, but how about I stop paying property taxes for this public university?
[03:55:17.711 --> 03:55:20.173]  I had one student tell me, oh, well, just my tuition's paying for it.
[03:55:20.193 --> 03:55:21.995]  It's like, your tuition's not paying the whole way.
[03:55:22.575 --> 03:55:24.157]  You're being subsidized by taxpayers.
[03:55:24.777 --> 03:55:30.242]  I mean, there was a campus official there in a suit and tie who's on stage going around looking at people's signs.
[03:55:30.302 --> 03:55:32.184]  If you had an anti-gun sign, he let you stay.
[03:55:32.564 --> 03:55:36.648]  But if you had a pro-gun sign like Tom Jefferson did, who got arrested, he called the cops on you.
[03:55:37.288 --> 03:55:41.249]  Like I was saying before the break, the gun rights supporters there were not part of any sort of movement.
[03:55:41.269 --> 03:55:43.670]  They were just individuals that were trying to protect their liberties.
[03:55:44.110 --> 03:55:52.612]  Whereas you've got this big gun control group that are bankrolled by George Soros and Michael Bloomberg for billions of dollars.
[03:55:54.932 --> 03:55:56.553]  Gun control movements are top down.
[03:55:56.593 --> 03:56:02.074]  They're getting orders from Soros and Bloomberg and all these politicians and globalists and internationalists.
[03:56:02.734 --> 03:56:10.540]  Whereas the people that are fighting for your Second Amendment rights and all your rights, all your Bill of Rights, these are people that are just fighting for themselves.
[03:56:10.680 --> 03:56:14.483]  They don't, their only dog in the fight is their individual rights.
[03:56:14.503 --> 03:56:18.306]  They understand that they need protection because just like what do they do?
[03:56:18.506 --> 03:56:20.628]  If you need help, they pick up the phone, they call the cops.
[03:56:20.648 --> 03:56:22.769]  So why do they call the cops and not the fire department?
[03:56:22.789 --> 03:56:24.471]  Because the fire department doesn't have guns.
[03:56:24.791 --> 03:56:26.332]  They want somebody to show up with a gun.
[03:56:26.372 --> 03:56:27.473]  They don't want the ambulance driver.
[03:56:27.493 --> 03:56:28.474]  They want the cops to come up.
[03:56:28.894 --> 03:56:31.476]  With the firearm and squash the situation.
[03:56:31.896 --> 03:56:37.300]  So when people have the ability to defend themselves, they don't have to be as dependent on law enforcement.
[03:56:37.340 --> 03:56:38.501]  It's not knocking law enforcement.
[03:56:38.521 --> 03:56:41.483]  It's just saying these people have a desire to be self-sufficient.
[03:56:42.384 --> 03:56:44.645]  They all the time, they talk about campus rape, campus rape.
[03:56:44.886 --> 03:56:53.552]  Well, hell, if the girls were packing, you know, packing a Roscoe in their purse, they probably wouldn't have this epidemic of campus rape going around on these college campuses.
[03:56:53.752 --> 03:56:56.014]  Well, they don't want women to be able to protect themselves, though.
[03:56:56.514 --> 03:57:06.841]  I was talking to this one gun control advocate, a college student there, and she was like, well, we've got to think about the rights for the community and what the community needs.
[03:57:06.861 --> 03:57:08.522]  I was like, what about the rights of the individual?
[03:57:08.562 --> 03:57:10.523]  Because the individual is the smallest minority.
[03:57:11.124 --> 03:57:14.006]  Why can't we support the rights of the minority?
[03:57:14.639 --> 03:57:20.085]  Yeah, and what was the, did anyone talk about the fact that the Constitution is their permit to carry a gun?
[03:57:20.105 --> 03:57:21.407]  Yeah, here's the other interesting thing.
[03:57:21.427 --> 03:57:32.900]  When I said earlier about, before the break, about how the gun control groups are manufacturing consent from these people, all the college kids there that were for gun control, they were just parodying what they heard in the mainstream media or what politicians told them.
[03:57:33.360 --> 03:57:39.684]  The gun rights supporters there, they were the ones that knew about the rights in the Second Amendment and the Constitution and history.
[03:57:39.965 --> 03:57:41.546]  Especially history, that's an important thing.
[03:57:42.026 --> 03:57:45.348]  They weren't just being, they weren't just parroting what someone else told them.
[03:57:45.688 --> 03:57:53.293]  And as Biggs was pointing out earlier in the broadcast, most of the people who were there to protest the gun rights weren't even old enough to own a handgun in the first place.
[03:57:53.313 --> 03:57:58.637]  So, you know, you think all these people think that everybody's gonna be packing heat around the campuses.
[03:57:58.977 --> 03:57:59.858]  That's not the case.
[03:57:59.918 --> 03:58:02.760]  The majority of the people who were there couldn't even own a handgun.
[03:58:03.300 --> 03:58:05.823]  On the campus, whether at home or at the campus.
[03:58:06.344 --> 03:58:10.930]  Well, does it offend you that they wear these shirts that they are armed with reason?
[03:58:10.950 --> 03:58:11.751]  I think it's amusing.
[03:58:11.771 --> 03:58:14.154]  How's reason going to stop you from a rapist or a murderer?
[03:58:14.434 --> 03:58:16.497]  As you're sitting there talking about, they have nothing to say.
[03:58:16.517 --> 03:58:19.561]  Don't rob me or kill me.
[03:58:19.661 --> 03:58:20.342]  I got reasons.
[03:58:20.382 --> 03:58:21.123]  I'm armed with reason.
[03:58:21.403 --> 03:58:26.366]  Just like I was talking to Captain America, we put up the video, a gun-free zone sign doesn't stop bullets.
[03:58:26.386 --> 03:58:30.489]  That was evidenced by the armed services shooting at the recruiting stations.
[03:58:30.509 --> 03:58:33.972]  And also that shirt right there, armed reason, that's not going to stop a bullet.
[03:58:34.732 --> 03:58:36.393]  No, absolutely not.
[03:58:36.433 --> 03:58:40.076]  That's what Obama wants to do though, to fight ISIS and everything.
[03:58:40.156 --> 03:58:40.896]  It's in reality.
[03:58:41.296 --> 03:58:43.198]  Not having reason is reason, Obama's America.
[03:58:45.572 --> 03:58:46.933]  You're absolutely right about that.
[03:58:47.334 --> 03:58:50.076]  Well, so Ja'Kari, what's coming up on the news tonight?

[03:58:59.124 --> 03:59:03.247]  Many of the products at Infowarslive.com are true game changers.
[03:59:03.448 --> 03:59:07.631]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[03:59:07.691 --> 03:59:08.592]  But when we look at a product
