[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.301]  He escaped South American native tribes using them.
[00:00:12.822 --> 00:00:15.103]  He fought Nazi strongmen on top of them.
[00:00:15.523 --> 00:00:25.608]  And now, actor Harrison Ford, aka Han Solo, Indiana Jones, and Jack Ryan has crash landed a prop plane on a golf course and he survived and nearly walked away.
[00:00:25.628 --> 00:00:27.729]  Stay sharp, there's two more coming in.
[00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:28.750]  They're gonna try and cut us off.
[00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.473]  Besides, I know a few maneuvers will lose him.
[00:00:40.342 --> 00:00:43.344]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:43.624 --> 00:00:54.931]  That's right, yesterday on March 5, 2015, Harrison Ford took off in his Ryan PT-22 plane, which is a two-place open cockpit trainer plane manufactured during World War II to train U.S.
[00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:55.712]  military pilots.
[00:00:56.317 --> 00:01:01.960]  It was built in 1942 and has a 160 horsepower radial engine and a top speed of 131 miles an hour.
[00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:04.142]  It was retired by the military after the war.
[00:01:04.862 --> 00:01:10.325]  Immediately upon takeoff, Ford had engine trouble and had to immediately make a U-turn and turn around back to the airport.
[00:01:10.686 --> 00:01:12.507]  Unfortunately, he didn't make it that far.
[00:01:12.547 --> 00:01:17.470]  As you can see, he crashed on the 8th hole of the Pinmar Golf Course near Santa Monica Airport.
[00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.191]  53178, engine failure.
[00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:20.852]  Immediate return.
[00:01:21.698 --> 00:01:24.141]  Ryan 1-7-8, 1-8-2-1, clear to land.
[00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:29.326]  Witnesses say he made a nosedive on the 8th hole tee and proceeded to glide into a crash landing.
[00:01:29.947 --> 00:01:37.995]  And I've got to say, when you take an aerial look over where he crashed, had he not made it to the golf course, he could have easily crashed into a number of houses and most likely died.
[00:01:38.055 --> 00:01:42.540]  We've seen plenty of plane crashes out there where small prop planes crash into houses and nobody makes it out.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.422]  So he was very lucky in this regard.
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.302]  Unfortunately, his cockpit was not made of carbonite.
[00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:53.024]  He was pulled from the crash by several golfers, luckily one of which was a surgeon.
[00:02:13.578 --> 00:02:15.179]  He had a cut in his face that was very deep.
[00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:18.921]  Witnesses say a swath of skin was missing and there was blood dripping down his face.
[00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:23.704]  He was taken to UCLA Medical Center in critical condition, but has since been upgraded to moderate.
[00:02:24.084 --> 00:02:25.225]  His son, Ben, tweeted this.
[00:02:41.673 --> 00:02:49.180]  Ford's quick thinking and abilities reminded me of another plane crash that happened back in 2009 in January, and that was that of Captain Sully Sullenberg.
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.443]  He made a crash landing into the Hudson River after experiencing engine trouble.
[00:02:53.484 --> 00:02:59.309]  His quick thinking and training allowed Sullenberg to make a picture-perfect landing on the Hudson River with 155 souls on board.
[00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.191]  His landing was touted as a miracle.
[00:03:01.652 --> 00:03:02.813]  But I don't think it was a miracle.
[00:03:03.173 --> 00:03:03.753]  It was luck.
[00:03:04.394 --> 00:03:05.195]  And what is luck?
[00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.606]  Luck is the intersection of preparation and timing.
[00:03:09.027 --> 00:03:10.731]  And that's what you have to ask yourself out there.
[00:03:11.112 --> 00:03:12.074]  Are you prepared in life?
[00:03:12.947 --> 00:03:19.370]  Are you a concealed carry handgun owner who maybe will be in the right place at the right time when somebody decides to go on a crazy shooting rampage?
[00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.871]  Are you prepared if the stock market crashes?
[00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:24.952]  Are you prepared if society breaks down and there's riots?
[00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:26.653]  What are you doing in life?
[00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:27.393]  Are you awake?
[00:03:28.093 --> 00:03:30.935]  These two men are examples of people who are awake and prepared.
[00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:37.377]  And with luck and a little bit of preparation and timing, they were able to both make the best out of a bad situation.
[00:03:38.138 --> 00:03:40.919]  The world's going through a lot of changes right now and sides are being drawn.
[00:03:41.704 --> 00:03:44.108]  Are you going to be on the side of freedom and individual liberty?
[00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:47.093]  Or on the side of a collectivist, politically correct tyranny?
[00:03:47.774 --> 00:03:52.843]  Remember stories like these that showcase the dynamic, quick-thinking, prepared human spirit that refuses to submit.

[00:05:21.266 --> 00:05:26.249]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
