[00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.542]  Bilderberg, 2015.
[00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:16.189]  You'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
[00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.212]  We must be cautious in Austria.
[00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:27.316]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[00:00:27.316 --> 00:00:30.417]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.417 --> 00:00:32.038]  It's already the 10th day of June, 2015.
[00:00:32.038 --> 00:00:36.239]  Our reporters are now in place.
[00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.319]  Paul Watson is arriving as we speak in Austria.
[00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:44.141]  Of course, Rob Dew and Josh Owens have been in place for the last three, four days.
[00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:45.021]  They got there Sunday.
[00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.872]  Evening and we're going to be breaking down huge developments.
[00:00:49.872 --> 00:01:04.120]  The dam has yet again broken on the news blockade on Bilderberg and mainstream media is calling it the most exclusive meeting in the world and admitting that policies being set and now investigations are being called for all over Europe and the UK.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.783]  There is a news blackout in the United States.
[00:01:08.783 --> 00:01:11.405]  They are threatening two weeks in prison
[00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:17.011]  And 500 euro fine if you step foot in the giant exclusion zone.
[00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:19.872]  That's now front page in the Austrian newspapers.
[00:01:19.872 --> 00:01:23.534]  Convicted criminal David Petraeus to represent the US at Bilderberg.
[00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:28.356]  We've got Austrians that are really angry on video about the Bilderberg takeover.
[00:01:28.356 --> 00:01:30.617]  And Paul Watson has done an incredible video.
[00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:32.419]  Nine minutes.
[00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:38.323]  It's just amazing the focus he's got boiling down their secret agenda and their public agenda.
[00:01:38.323 --> 00:01:39.044]  That's coming up.
[00:01:39.044 --> 00:01:41.646]  We'll talk to our reporters on the ground and more.
[00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:46.449]  But exposing Bilderberg will shoot some major holes in the New World Order agenda.
[00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:50.132]  That's why we're focusing on it because it's a window into the real world.
[00:01:50.132 --> 00:01:53.815]  And if we get the public to wake up to that, it's a big win for humanity.
[00:01:53.815 --> 00:01:57.418]  Here's John Bowne's report on the background of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:01:57.418 --> 00:01:59.940]  Welcome to Bilderberg Exposed.
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.361]  Evolution by stealth.
[00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:12.729]  Tonight we will examine the influence of the Council of Foreign Relations on the Bilderberg Group and document the objectives of the Masters of World Domination.
[00:02:13.678 --> 00:02:21.246]  In order to fundamentally understand Bilderberg, we must look at the origin and influence of the CFR.
[00:02:21.246 --> 00:02:35.682]  The Council on Foreign Relations was founded after World War I, when Woodrow Wilson tasked his advisor Edward Howse to create a fellowship of 150 scholars to formulate a new foreign policy strategy.
[00:02:35.982 --> 00:02:44.469]  From the very beginning, the CFR was committed to a one-world government based on a centralized global financial system.
[00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:47.112]  A global congress would need to be assembled.
[00:02:47.112 --> 00:03:01.384]  So by invitation only, leaders of the world in industry, politics, media, and royalty were brought in to discuss an extreme secrecy planning related to global domination by the selected elite.
[00:03:01.884 --> 00:03:29.524]  The objectives of the Bilderberg Group include one set of universal values, control of world public opinion by mind control, an end to the middle class, only rulers and servants, a zero growth society, order out of chaos and perpetual wars, total control of education to program the public mind as a servant class, centralized control of all foreign and domestic policies,
[00:03:29.944 --> 00:03:41.291]  ...impose a UN tax on world citizens, expanding NAFTA in the World Trade Organization globally, and expansion of NATO as a world military.
[00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:57.501]  In the 1960s, the attendees included Prince Philip, Paul-Henri Spock, former Secretary General of NATO, former Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada, former Secretary of the new Department of Economic Affairs, Eric Rohl, former President Gerald Ford,
[00:03:58.041 --> 00:03:59.022]  Former U.S.
[00:03:59.022 --> 00:04:01.883]  Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger.
[00:04:01.883 --> 00:04:02.664]  Former U.S.
[00:04:02.664 --> 00:04:05.245]  Secretary of State, Christian Herter.
[00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:09.327]  And Special Assistant to the President, Charles Douglas Jackson.
[00:04:09.327 --> 00:04:15.711]  The final names are especially important, as they boldly violated the Logan Act, a U.S.
[00:04:15.711 --> 00:04:21.054]  federal law that forbids unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign governments.
[00:04:21.054 --> 00:04:23.475]  Violation of the Logan Act is a felony.
[00:04:23.895 --> 00:04:28.639]  Punishable under federal law with imprisonment of up to three years.
[00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:38.448]  For more information regarding Bilderberg, please visit Infowarsstore.com and pick up Daniel Estulin's excellent work, The Octopus Deception.
[00:04:38.448 --> 00:04:44.594]  Please join us tomorrow when we examine how the Bilderberg Group manufactured the United States Presidents in the 1970s.
[00:04:46.195 --> 00:04:54.578]  And how these commanders-in-chief conspired with foreign entities illegally to forward the goals of a New World Order.
[00:04:54.578 --> 00:04:58.379]  As the elitist Bilderberg agenda evolves by stealth.
[00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.859]  We'll be back.
[00:04:58.859 --> 00:05:01.320]  This is John Bowne with the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.661]  House Speaker Boehner says fast-track legislation will likely be voted on by the House this weekend.
[00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:13.184]  The only snag, they say, is working out how they're going to get welfare checks to Americans who are going to lose their jobs.
[00:05:13.184 --> 00:05:16.205]  But it's not just jobs and wealth that we're losing.
[00:05:16.205 --> 00:05:24.389]  Senator Jeff Sessions, one of the few people in either House of Congress to actually bother to read the secret treaty, is very disturbed by what he's seeing.
[00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:27.630]  As he points out, it is a treaty with fast track.
[00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.735]  Congress is giving up the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds vote to pass a treaty.
[00:05:33.735 --> 00:05:39.420]  But the biggest secret of this secret agreement is that it creates a commission with global governance powers.
[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:45.225]  This commission will be able to modify the treaty without any further input from any country.
[00:05:45.225 --> 00:05:55.173]  As Senator Sessions says, Congress would be pre-clearing a political and economic union before a word of that arrangement has been made available to a single private citizen.
[00:05:56.618 --> 00:05:58.926]  For more information, go to n4wars.com.
[00:05:58.926 --> 00:05:59.488]  I'm David Nike.
[00:06:00.802 --> 00:06:04.304]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:04.304 --> 00:06:12.549]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:06:12.549 --> 00:06:17.973]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:06:17.973 --> 00:06:20.514]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:06:20.514 --> 00:06:22.596]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:06:30.698 --> 00:06:31.718]  Alex Jones here.
[00:06:31.718 --> 00:06:41.002]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:44.804]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:53.127]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[00:06:53.127 --> 00:06:55.448]  Visit Infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:56.488]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:03.674 --> 00:07:13.396]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:07:13.396 --> 00:07:16.097]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:07:16.097 --> 00:07:19.658]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:07:19.658 --> 00:07:25.980]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.821]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[00:07:31.101 --> 00:07:37.485]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[00:07:37.485 --> 00:07:45.230]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:52.794]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[00:07:52.794 --> 00:07:56.377]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:56.377 --> 00:07:59.318]  That's ChildEase exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:08:01.288 --> 00:08:06.150]  Paul Watson filed a very powerful report
[00:08:27.509 --> 00:08:48.622]  This morning at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com Bilderberg 2015 to focus on rebranding authoritarianism and in the article and in the video piece that accompanies it he lays out their secret and their public agenda that are pretty much one and the same.
[00:08:48.622 --> 00:08:54.686]  We're going to play that detailed report that really deserves a lot of attention here in just a moment.
[00:09:00.219 --> 00:09:11.242]  Then we're going to be talking to our reporters from Austria at the bottom of the hour, Rob Dew and Josh Owens, about the major developments that have been unfolding.
[00:09:11.242 --> 00:09:19.205]  There is huge international coverage now of Bilderberg, with headlines like, just who exactly is going to Bilderberg meeting?
[00:09:21.288 --> 00:09:27.851]  Bilderberg, who's missing from the guest list for this year's most exclusive gathering, London Telegraph?
[00:09:27.851 --> 00:09:37.156]  And those are just some of the English speaking papers, the English language papers that are breaking it down.
[00:09:37.156 --> 00:09:49.583]  It is all over the German, Austrian, Spanish, Greece, Russian, you name it, pointing out that it's violating all sorts of federal laws in our country and others to have politicians meeting to set policy in secret.
[00:09:50.774 --> 00:09:55.738]  Every country has laws against this for obvious reasons.
[00:09:55.738 --> 00:09:56.779]  Because there's no record.
[00:09:56.779 --> 00:10:04.805]  Just like there's a congressional record, or even if there's a secret committee, there's got to be a record of what was discussed, and then 20 years later, it's supposed to be released.
[00:10:04.805 --> 00:10:11.490]  Because obviously, operating in secret, you can and will have internal takeovers.
[00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.952]  You've got people sitting over trillions of dollars of budgets,
[00:10:15.586 --> 00:10:22.870]  And they're secret, and they can keep reclassifying stuff 50, 60 years out as they do now.
[00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.391]  It's just absolutely criminal.
[00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:28.193]  Here's Paul Watson's report, and we'll get into all the other news.
[00:10:28.193 --> 00:10:37.638]  The Bilderberg Group has released its full participant list and agenda for the 2015 Elitist Confab days before it's set to begin in Austria.
[00:10:37.638 --> 00:10:43.161]  But as ever, the topics up for discussion are so vague as to almost be meaningless.
[00:10:43.681 --> 00:10:49.364]  And we know that many of the most sensitive topics never appear on the list in the first place.
[00:10:49.364 --> 00:10:53.126]  So what's the real agenda of Bilderberg 2015?
[00:10:53.126 --> 00:10:59.770]  For a start, it's unusual that Bilderberg is taking place after the G7 conference.
[00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.491]  It's normally the other way around.
[00:11:01.491 --> 00:11:07.314]  This suggests that Bilderberg's role in not only setting the consensus, but making the final call
[00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:11.036]  ...on many of these issues will be pivotal this year.
[00:11:11.036 --> 00:11:25.986]  The intense security surrounding the Interalpen Hotel, with our reporters Rob Dew and Josh Owens already having been harassed numerous times by police, illustrates how paranoid Bilderberg are about keeping the details of their agenda under wraps.
[00:11:26.346 --> 00:11:30.867]  Artificial intelligence will be one of the core discussion topics at Bilderberg 2015.
[00:11:30.867 --> 00:11:45.411]  And one of the most interesting newbies in terms of Bilderberg attendees is undoubtedly Regina Duggan, former DARPA director and now Google executive, and a pioneer of ingestible ID microchips.
[00:11:45.891 --> 00:12:08.763]  Duggan, along with Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and Demis Hassabis, Vice President of Engineering for Google DeepMind, will scheme with global powerbrokers on how to grease the skids for public acceptance and adoption of Big Brother technology that otherwise wouldn't look out of place in a dystopian sci-fi thriller.
[00:12:08.763 --> 00:12:14.806]  This all ties into Bilderberg's overarching goal of rebranding authoritarianism.
[00:12:14.986 --> 00:12:24.934]  As a result of endless money printing and growing wealth inequality, the global elite has created the preconditions for widespread riots and civil unrest.
[00:12:24.934 --> 00:12:28.997]  We already had a taste of this with Ferguson and Baltimore.
[00:12:28.997 --> 00:12:39.445]  Now the wealthy are buying safe rooms and secret hideaways in remote locations as they prepare to hunker down for the next stage of the economic collapse.
[00:12:39.645 --> 00:12:52.890]  And Bloomberg is now reporting that Johan Rupert, the billionaire owner of Cartier, is worried about artificial intelligence and robots replacing human workers, causing class warfare and social disorder.
[00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.331]  Make no mistake, Bilderberg wants class warfare.
[00:12:56.331 --> 00:13:00.333]  They want riots, because this allows the elite to exploit the chaos
[00:13:00.973 --> 00:13:07.637]  Pose as the saviours and introduce the solution of statist and economic totalitarianism.
[00:13:07.637 --> 00:13:16.702]  And if you want to get a true insight into what motivates Bilderberg, look no further than the guy who calls the shots, Henry Kissinger.
[00:13:16.702 --> 00:13:22.905]  All the other Bilderberg attendees bar David Rockefeller show deference to the National Security Advisor.
[00:13:22.905 --> 00:13:27.128]  Kissinger has always been an aggressive advocate of real politic.
[00:13:27.828 --> 00:13:35.173]  An amoral, Machiavellian form of diplomacy and policymaking which eschews morality and ethical considerations.
[00:13:35.173 --> 00:13:46.060]  And of course, Kissinger has been implicated in numerous war crimes, crimes against humanity, kidnap, torture and murder in places like Chile, Cambodia and East Timor.
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:55.687]  But what's most alarming is the fact that the 92-year-old Kissinger still advises the Obama administration today.
[00:13:56.167 --> 00:14:11.887]  He's been lobbying for years for regime change in Syria, which may at some stage be achieved as a result of ISIS, created partly as a result of the US arming other jihadist groups in the region, taking over half the country.
[00:14:11.887 --> 00:14:14.871]  Something the Syrian rebels could never accomplish.
[00:14:15.211 --> 00:14:33.831]  Under the guise of stopping terror financing to ISIS, which only seems to have become stronger since the US and others began officially targeting the terror organisation, Bilderberg will discuss imposing harsher bank restrictions, eviscerating whatever financial privacy we have left.
[00:14:34.452 --> 00:14:40.756]  As well as a coordinated EU crackdown on the sale of precious metals.
[00:14:40.756 --> 00:14:44.838]  This ties in to the wider war on cash.
[00:14:44.838 --> 00:14:50.921]  Numerous voices have recently called for eliminating physical currency altogether.
[00:14:50.921 --> 00:14:59.626]  Giving central banks and governments the power to directly control your finances under the justification of preventing an economic collapse.
[00:15:00.246 --> 00:15:12.129]  At its most authoritarian extreme, this means having to obtain government permission every time you withdraw or spend a moderately large sum of money.
[00:15:12.129 --> 00:15:18.811]  France is already set to introduce laws in September which will restrict French citizens from making cash payments over €1,000.
[00:15:20.851 --> 00:15:24.974]  Bilderberg is set to intensify this crackdown on cash.
[00:15:24.974 --> 00:15:39.284]  Preventing Greece from ditching the euro and stacking the deck against the EU referendum outvote in the United Kingdom will also be a core centrepiece of Bilderberg's agenda going forward over the next 12 months.
[00:15:39.284 --> 00:15:44.547]  The EU and the single currency is a pet project of Bilderberg.
[00:15:44.547 --> 00:15:48.230]  If that pillar of world government begins to crumble,
[00:15:48.730 --> 00:16:00.292]  It undermines the rest of the architecture of global government, including TPP, which again, despite not being on the official list, will be discussed by Bilderberg members.
[00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:06.934]  TPP could also be used to sneak through draconian climate change regulations under the radar.
[00:16:06.934 --> 00:16:16.716]  Bilderberg is scheming ways of how to bypass Congress and directly implement the post-industrial revolution that they've been pushing for over a decade.
[00:16:17.256 --> 00:16:28.879]  These measures, if fully implemented, will bankrupt the United States, cost millions of jobs, and force the country into de-industrialised debt slavery.
[00:16:28.879 --> 00:16:41.642]  Geopolitically, Bilderberg will also put pressure on recalcitrant European countries, like Austria, to further isolate Russia while encouraging the arming of Kiev-backed militias.
[00:16:42.222 --> 00:16:52.510]  Don't be surprised to see a major confrontation between NATO and the US before the end of the year as a result of this agenda.
[00:16:52.510 --> 00:17:01.897]  After slamming the G7 as authoritarian rule, China has also been completely frozen out of representation at Bilderberg 2015.
[00:17:01.897 --> 00:17:08.743]  The hegemonic importance of targeting Beijing's influence in the South China Sea, again,
[00:17:09.403 --> 00:17:16.167]  Potentially risking a devastating confrontation will be emphasized at Bilderberg 2015.
[00:17:16.167 --> 00:17:20.670]  Another topic up for discussion is the US presidential election.
[00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:34.298]  Let's not forget that Bilderberg almost certainly acted as kingmaker back in 2008 when both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were strongly rumored to have paid a visit to the conference in Chantilly, Virginia.
[00:17:34.298 --> 00:17:37.100]  The attendance of Jim Messina of the Messina Group
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:48.323]  The organization that ran Obama's 2012 re-election campaign proves that Hillary is Bilderberg's pick for 2016.
[00:17:48.323 --> 00:17:52.084]  Messina is now advising Hillary Clinton.
[00:17:52.084 --> 00:18:05.568]  His presence at Bilderberg will be focused around ensuring none of Hillary's potential challengers get the big bucks from the innumerable transnational banks and corporations that will be represented
[00:18:07.689 --> 00:18:13.013]  So in summary, Bilderberg's 2015 talking points and agenda for the next 12 months.
[00:18:36.468 --> 00:18:42.853]  Moving towards the abolition of cash and imposing economic totalitarianism.
[00:18:42.853 --> 00:18:48.537]  Discrediting the Out campaign for the United Kingdom's EU referendum.
[00:18:48.537 --> 00:18:55.562]  Rebranding authoritarianism in anticipation of the coming economic collapse.
[00:18:55.562 --> 00:18:59.765]  Finalising the TPP as the next pillar of global government.
[00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:06.314]  Dismantling China and the BRICS country's ability to challenge the unipolar system.
[00:19:07.501 --> 00:19:22.069]  Selling artificial intelligence and Big Brother surveillance as trendy and cool in order to fool the general public into adopting technology that will eviscerate their financial livelihoods and personal privacy.
[00:19:22.069 --> 00:19:31.134]  So that's what we know so far about the real agenda behind Bildberg 2015, with more leaks and information to come.
[00:19:31.134 --> 00:19:36.277]  I'll be travelling out to Austria to join InfoWars reporters Rob Dew and Josh Owens
[00:19:36.937 --> 00:19:45.784]  So be sure to check out the other videos on this channel and the Alex Jones Channel as we lead the coverage for Bilderberg 2015.
[00:19:45.784 --> 00:19:48.406]  That's right.
[00:19:48.406 --> 00:19:50.248]  Excellent job Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:19:50.248 --> 00:19:51.148]  He's now in Austria.
[00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:52.149]  He's now on the ground.
[00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:57.613]  He may even be joining us coming up here in about 10 minutes from our live feed on top of the hotel.
[00:19:57.613 --> 00:19:59.295]  It's all coming up.
[00:19:59.295 --> 00:20:00.456]  He deserves a Pulitzer Prize.
[00:20:01.474 --> 00:20:07.720]  It's time to build your own emergency food stockpile with the industry leader, MyPatriotSupply.

[00:22:00.373 --> 00:22:02.155]  Honey, it's time for dinner.
[00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:04.017]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[00:22:04.017 --> 00:22:05.498]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[00:22:05.498 --> 00:22:07.020]  Mine is falling apart.
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:13.206]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[00:22:13.206 --> 00:22:16.429]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[00:22:16.429 --> 00:22:16.950]  What is that?
[00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:26.798]  Well, apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[00:22:26.798 --> 00:22:35.526]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[00:22:35.526 --> 00:22:36.146]  Wow!
[00:22:36.146 --> 00:22:37.467]  That sounds scary.
[00:22:37.467 --> 00:22:41.931]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold shielded wallet.
[00:22:41.931 --> 00:22:42.752]  Are they more expensive?
[00:22:43.172 --> 00:22:43.693]  No.
[00:22:43.693 --> 00:22:51.381]  In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from IDStronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[00:22:51.381 --> 00:22:52.562]  Sounds great!
[00:22:52.562 --> 00:22:55.185]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[00:22:55.185 --> 00:22:59.270]  I want to be protected and these wallets at IDStronghold.com look fantastic!
[00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:00.730]  Hey, Berkey Guy here.

[00:23:02.571 --> 00:23:04.312]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?

[00:23:57.538 --> 00:23:58.419]  Come and take it!
[00:24:13.394 --> 00:24:22.300]  We are on the march, the globalists are on the run, but they're fleeing forward trying to accelerate and cement their plans that are in deep trouble.
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:29.745]  In the process of trying to establish an open fascist planetary government, they are endangering the entire globe.
[00:24:29.745 --> 00:24:35.288]  And we've got more economists, more experts coming out saying they believe we're going to have World War III,
[00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:46.336]  The owner of Alibaba, arguably bigger than Amazon, is coming out saying he thinks World War III is coming and it's a good thing.
[00:24:46.336 --> 00:24:53.760]  This shows the delusional, crazy town stuff that's starting to go on with these elites.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:25:02.305]  I don't care how many mansions you've got or how many underground bunkers or jet copters or how many mistresses these people may have.
[00:25:02.305 --> 00:25:05.748]  World War III is something the planet probably won't survive, much less you.
[00:25:07.503 --> 00:25:10.545]  But they're megalomaniacs, and they've lost connection to reality.
[00:25:10.545 --> 00:25:16.148]  I mean, Hitler wasn't a novice.
[00:25:16.148 --> 00:25:24.072]  He was a combat vet of World War I, but he still became delusional and bit off more than he could chew.
[00:25:24.072 --> 00:25:35.058]  I mean, he had 70 million Germans total, and he thought he was going to take over billions of people.
[00:25:35.058 --> 00:25:35.698]  Gave it a good go.
[00:25:37.892 --> 00:25:41.793]  But the delusion soon wore off.
[00:25:41.793 --> 00:25:46.255]  And these elites today, I mean, almost every elite ends up getting crazy at the end of an empire.
[00:25:46.255 --> 00:25:48.356]  And they always start wars, they end up losing.
[00:25:48.356 --> 00:25:51.437]  And now we have this happen, it's goodbye!
[00:25:51.437 --> 00:25:57.379]  Goodbye, we'll be the dead planet!
[00:25:57.379 --> 00:26:03.141]  I mean, life will reconstitute itself and creep back, who knows how many hundreds of thousands of years it'll take.
[00:26:04.363 --> 00:26:10.267]  Bacteria and insects and things will continue on, but goodbye planet Earth.
[00:26:10.267 --> 00:26:14.289]  For all intents and purposes, they want to trash this sucker out big time.
[00:26:14.289 --> 00:26:25.316]  Like a spoiled rock band throwing television sets off the 25th floor.
[00:26:25.316 --> 00:26:29.118]  In the second hour, I'm going to cover the geopolitical news, the economic news.
[00:26:29.118 --> 00:26:31.500]  It's all very intense.
[00:26:33.268 --> 00:26:35.370]  We're going to hit Bilderberg this hour.
[00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:44.918]  Then, in the third hour, Trends Forecaster Gerald Cilente joins us with his latest trend projections, his take on Bilderberg, the TPP, and more.
[00:26:44.918 --> 00:26:46.359]  Always enjoy having Gerald Cilente on.
[00:26:46.359 --> 00:26:49.922]  His new Trends Journal is out.
[00:26:49.922 --> 00:26:51.503]  Spring edition.
[00:26:51.503 --> 00:26:55.567]  Liars, cowards, freaks, and fools spend a while.
[00:26:55.567 --> 00:26:57.689]  Welcome to the Presidential Reality Show.
[00:27:01.459 --> 00:27:04.081]  Let me just give you some of the headlines that are here.
[00:27:04.081 --> 00:27:12.266]  I've probably said this 500, 600 times in the last four years that they would end up sending Al-Qaeda into Syria and other areas.
[00:27:12.266 --> 00:27:16.689]  They were then given the weapons in Benghazi and then they will end up attacking the West.
[00:27:16.689 --> 00:27:18.770]  That'll be used to take our liberties.
[00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:25.215]  When they shoot up a shopping mall or a high school or a convention center, I predicted that.
[00:27:26.445 --> 00:27:29.267]  The calls will be to restrict our Second Amendments.
[00:27:29.267 --> 00:27:30.968]  Well, it wasn't hard to predict this.
[00:27:30.968 --> 00:27:34.170]  The London Independence Day.
[00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.570]  ISIS dirty bomb.
[00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:42.234]  Jihadists have seized enough radioactive material to build their first WMD.
[00:27:42.234 --> 00:27:50.059]  When our own government created this organization and changed their name to ISIS to confuse the public when the military said they wouldn't be part of it.
[00:27:51.715 --> 00:28:07.783]  But it's now been, not just leaked, but Defense Intelligence confirmed those documents a month ago and declassified that they quote, predicted that arming the rebels would create a Salafist state in the area.
[00:28:07.783 --> 00:28:11.365]  So they kind of hedged their bet and complained at the time and said, we don't want to do this.
[00:28:11.365 --> 00:28:12.446]  Was that moral?
[00:28:12.446 --> 00:28:13.847]  Was it Machiavellian?
[00:28:13.847 --> 00:28:15.427]  Whatever, it's the same thing.
[00:28:15.427 --> 00:28:18.769]  Our criminal government armed Al Qaeda.
[00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:20.090]  And then changed their name to confuse the public.
[00:28:23.257 --> 00:28:25.518]  Coming up, we're going to get to Syrian rebels.
[00:28:25.518 --> 00:28:32.702]  He's largest army base in Dera.
[00:28:32.702 --> 00:28:34.083]  They're taking control of the country.
[00:28:34.083 --> 00:28:39.006]  They're winning because they ran back into Iraq, got secretly supplied by NATO, and they're going in hard.
[00:28:40.287 --> 00:28:45.893]  So they can chop off every Christian's head they find, throw people off roofs, just murder everyone.
[00:28:45.893 --> 00:28:47.415]  Oh, if you're a homosexual, you're dead.
[00:28:47.415 --> 00:28:49.577]  But no feminist, no liberal.
[00:28:49.577 --> 00:28:52.781]  That's okay because it's trendy, it's sexy, it's cool.
[00:28:52.781 --> 00:28:54.503]  The White House is doing this.
[00:28:54.503 --> 00:28:57.225]  It's anti-Western.
[00:28:57.225 --> 00:29:00.309]  You go out to any communist march and there'll be a bunch of radical jihadis with them.
[00:29:02.878 --> 00:29:14.446]  With women screaming, white, white women, white privilege, white men are pigs, all males are bad, I love Stalin, I love Satan, I love Mao.
[00:29:14.446 --> 00:29:19.910]  When the jihadis would sexually mutilate them and put a bag over their head if they were lucky.
[00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:23.973]  But they love that because it's destructive and evil.
[00:29:23.973 --> 00:29:26.415]  The West, with women empowered,
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:35.764]  They want to dominate it and wreck it, so they can be overrun and put in slave pits with bags on their heads.
[00:29:35.764 --> 00:29:37.646]  And they can't drive cars.
[00:29:37.646 --> 00:29:39.047]  That's their dream.
[00:29:39.047 --> 00:29:45.070]  To have bags put on their heads, be sexually mutilated, and not be able to drive a car, and be beaten and raped.
[00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.471]  They love it.
[00:29:46.471 --> 00:29:48.773]  They hate the country that gave them the freedom.
[00:29:48.773 --> 00:29:49.153]  We'll be back.
[00:29:49.153 --> 00:29:50.334]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.334 --> 00:29:51.735]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.735 --> 00:29:54.256]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.256 --> 00:29:56.938]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.232 --> 00:30:02.313]  It's that time again.
[00:30:02.313 --> 00:30:06.314]  A private party with some of the most powerful people on earth.
[00:30:06.314 --> 00:30:10.176]  Privacy guaranteed by thousands of police, paid for by the public.
[00:30:14.369 --> 00:30:29.314]  And besides Kissinger, regular attendee David Petraeus will be there with his get-out-of-jail card, courtesy of pals like Tony Blair, who put in a good word for him when he leaked reams of classified documents, as long as he doesn't reveal any Bilderberg secrets.
[00:30:29.314 --> 00:30:42.759]  And of course, there's the heads of banks, who've recently been caught rigging interest rates with LIBOR, rigging currency exchanges, commodity rates, pretty much rigging every market, and getting caught money laundering, but just getting off with a slap on the wrist.
[00:30:42.759 --> 00:30:43.639]  Where are the police?
[00:30:44.139 --> 00:30:48.084]  If you have a party at your home and there comes a burglar, it's also your private home.
[00:30:48.084 --> 00:30:48.584]  Sure.
[00:30:48.584 --> 00:30:50.787]  And we save it.
[00:30:50.787 --> 00:30:52.809]  Somebody needs to keep an eye on these crooks.
[00:30:52.809 --> 00:30:54.912]  Tune in to Infowars.com.

[00:31:13.531 --> 00:31:20.657]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[00:31:20.677 --> 00:31:21.317]  I don't know.
[00:31:40.766 --> 00:31:51.579]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.

[00:32:34.154 --> 00:32:42.398]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:32:42.398 --> 00:32:47.800]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:33:17.359 --> 00:33:21.983]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:21.983 --> 00:33:25.846]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:33.436 --> 00:33:35.977]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:35.977 --> 00:33:36.677]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:36.677 --> 00:33:37.818]  Central.
[00:33:37.818 --> 00:33:41.059]  We return weeknight 7 o'clock with InfoWorks Nightly News.
[00:33:41.059 --> 00:33:45.901]  Also do an abbreviated two-hour transmission live every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:45.901 --> 00:33:53.104]  And of course routinely David Knight comes and co-hosts the broadcast with us as well.
[00:33:53.104 --> 00:34:01.167]  We have three of our great reporters in the field in Austria right now covering Bilderberg 2015.
[00:34:04.838 --> 00:34:17.008]  And I think it's important just to take a deep breath and to pull back and to observe the planet and who's controlling it.
[00:34:17.008 --> 00:34:26.256]  Kit Daniels has an excellent article up on Infowars.com that is so important.
[00:34:26.256 --> 00:34:32.601]  Dealing with the quotes, the evil quotes of Bilderberg and then linking to where members of Bilderberg made these statements.
[00:34:37.418 --> 00:34:42.300]  The headline is the most evil quotes from Bilderberg insiders.
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:45.801]  There's another article, the spirit of Jim Tucker seen at Bilderberg 2015.
[00:34:45.801 --> 00:34:52.324]  And it's an allegory, we're not saying we actually saw Casper the Friendly Gust.
[00:34:52.324 --> 00:34:56.265]  Another video, Austrians mad as hell at Bilderberg 2015.
[00:34:56.265 --> 00:35:00.607]  Convicted criminal David Petraeus to represent US at Bilderberg.
[00:35:02.524 --> 00:35:09.448]  500 euro fine or two weeks in prison for entering giant exclusion zone security zone at Bilderberg.
[00:35:09.448 --> 00:35:11.609]  That is such important news.
[00:35:11.609 --> 00:35:19.533]  Bilderberg 2015 to focus on rebranding authoritarianism with a very important video that we aired earlier where Watson breaks it all down.
[00:35:19.533 --> 00:35:22.175]  It's the most important nine minutes on Bilderberg out there.
[00:35:24.298 --> 00:35:45.402]  How they want to bring in a planetary government with carbon taxes and computer systems, with smart dust as they call it, RFID in everything, tracking the internet of things, taxing, micromanaging, shutting down local farming, shutting down community centers, shutting down anything independent.
[00:35:45.402 --> 00:35:51.063]  A cashless society tracking everything you do and then taxing the daylights out of you.
[00:35:52.378 --> 00:35:58.723]  And gaming the economies like they game interest rates, currency rates, and the stock markets.
[00:35:58.723 --> 00:35:59.963]  That's all admitted.
[00:35:59.963 --> 00:36:05.307]  And you look at who's at this meeting, these are the people that own Dutch Royal Shell and BP.
[00:36:05.307 --> 00:36:08.169]  And their wealth are state secrets, like Queen Beatrix.
[00:36:08.169 --> 00:36:19.117]  These are the people that are financing through their foundations, like Ford and Rockefeller and Carnegie, taking our guns, breaking up the family, demonizing men as good role models.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.301]  They are the engines and they are the captains.
[00:36:26.301 --> 00:36:33.524]  They are the system of anti-human exterminism for a global decline.
[00:36:33.524 --> 00:36:35.165]  They publicly say zero growth.
[00:36:35.165 --> 00:36:40.747]  They want a decline into what they call neo-feudalism.
[00:36:40.747 --> 00:36:46.449]  Where they get the life extension, they get the power, they get to live in the countryside in beautiful complexes.
[00:36:46.449 --> 00:36:48.250]  We live in giant mega-city prisons.
[00:37:02.264 --> 00:37:11.891]  This is the group openly funding ISIS and Al Qaeda to destabilize and bring in fear so they can bring in the solution.
[00:37:11.891 --> 00:37:16.834]  This is the group openly funding civil unrest and destabilization.
[00:37:16.834 --> 00:37:19.336]  This is the group.
[00:37:19.336 --> 00:37:30.624]  And you look at the members of it, they are mainly just super gophers for the royalty and the top controllers who also attend, who then go out and have their legions of minions under them.
[00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:47.305]  It's a major summit where they fine-tune existing global treaties, corporate treaties, from the different corporate houses and the different imperial families that sit behind those houses.
[00:37:47.305 --> 00:37:55.813]  When I say imperial, I mean the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Li family in China, the Japanese royalty.
[00:37:56.724 --> 00:37:59.405]  You look at who runs this whole show, folks.
[00:37:59.405 --> 00:38:05.449]  They are anti-human demons who come from lines of genetic psychopaths.
[00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:11.632]  And so they're willing and able and hungry and desire secretive control.
[00:38:11.632 --> 00:38:17.595]  But the minute you blast them with spotlights of truth, I love to be out in the sun.
[00:38:17.595 --> 00:38:18.116]  Feels good.
[00:38:18.116 --> 00:38:20.917]  I enjoy it.
[00:38:20.917 --> 00:38:23.258]  Globalists don't like it.
[00:38:23.258 --> 00:38:24.679]  And I mean that as an allegory.
[00:38:24.679 --> 00:38:25.920]  Their skin burns.
[00:38:27.418 --> 00:38:29.439]  Like vampires.
[00:38:29.439 --> 00:38:33.382]  The light of truth hits them, they start to fry.
[00:38:33.382 --> 00:38:36.485]  And we're there frying them right now.
[00:38:36.485 --> 00:38:38.306]  Because they are the ones attacking us.
[00:38:38.306 --> 00:38:39.647]  They're the ones in our face.
[00:38:39.647 --> 00:38:41.968]  They're the ones that have committed all these crimes.
[00:38:41.968 --> 00:38:43.790]  I mean, go read their unbelievable quotes.
[00:38:51.684 --> 00:39:00.829]  I'm going to cover other news, like West Coast of North America to be slammed in 2016 with 80% as much Fukushima radiation as Japan.
[00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:08.374]  Clearing your browser history can be deemed obstruction of justice in the U.S., even though you've got to clear the cookies and stuff to get better deals on the Internet.
[00:39:08.374 --> 00:39:10.915]  Doesn't matter, it's criminal.
[00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:13.316]  They can indict you and send you to 20 years in prison for it.
[00:39:13.316 --> 00:39:15.257]  We're going to be covering that.
[00:39:15.257 --> 00:39:16.438]  There is no law.
[00:39:16.438 --> 00:39:21.241]  They just deem it, misapply, and then have a kangaroo jury.
[00:39:22.992 --> 00:39:28.255]  Sends you down the river.
[00:39:28.255 --> 00:39:29.616]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:39:29.616 --> 00:39:36.901]  Evil tyranny of this level will burn and drown everyone involved in it as well.
[00:39:36.901 --> 00:39:42.664]  The gun of oppression kicks as hard as it shoots.
[00:39:42.664 --> 00:39:48.708]  The lovers of tyranny, the lovers of death, will get to drink deeply from the cups they've poured.
[00:39:56.018 --> 00:40:03.127]  Now joining us from outside the security perimeter where you get two weeks in prison and fines.
[00:40:03.127 --> 00:40:06.512]  That's being reported by the main Austrian news.
[00:40:06.512 --> 00:40:12.499]  Dinosaur Media has been embarrassed now by InfoWars.com and DrugsReport.com.
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:16.262]  No, it was actually really smooth getting in, Alex.
[00:40:16.262 --> 00:40:17.623]  What I noticed is there is a police presence
[00:40:38.127 --> 00:40:39.748]  Now at the airport, it's full of cops.
[00:40:39.748 --> 00:40:44.391]  There was one security official at the airport going around with a camera.
[00:40:44.391 --> 00:40:45.691]  He gave me some funny looks.
[00:40:45.691 --> 00:40:47.272]  I don't know if that's related.
[00:40:47.272 --> 00:40:55.237]  But what stands out to me is Bilderberg is where the real power lies because we saw how the journalists were treated at the G7 conference.
[00:40:55.237 --> 00:40:57.118]  Literally, they were pampered like royalty.
[00:40:57.859 --> 00:40:59.460]  They had food tables.
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:01.581]  They had relaxation rooms.
[00:41:01.581 --> 00:41:04.802]  They were even given goody bags with free t-shirts.
[00:41:04.802 --> 00:41:06.363]  They were completely pampered.
[00:41:06.363 --> 00:41:11.906]  And yet what's happened here, we've seen with Josh and Rob, completely harassed every single day.
[00:41:11.906 --> 00:41:15.347]  Now we've got reports... And they've been going after Guardian reporters as well.
[00:41:15.347 --> 00:41:20.950]  So the biggest paper, not just in the UK, but in Europe, they're harassing them as well.
[00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:22.051]  So a total 180.
[00:41:23.874 --> 00:41:25.055]  Total flip!
[00:41:25.055 --> 00:41:28.517]  And you know people say, oh it's just a game of golf, it's just a talking shop.
[00:41:28.517 --> 00:41:29.077]  No!
[00:41:29.077 --> 00:41:31.138]  The talking shop is the G7.
[00:41:31.138 --> 00:41:32.499]  That's the puppet show.
[00:41:32.499 --> 00:41:39.083]  This is where the real power is in evidence because it's a giant lobbying organisation.
[00:41:39.083 --> 00:41:42.425]  And again, Charlie Skelton reported about 30 minutes ago that
[00:41:42.925 --> 00:41:58.947]  People who he's with, other journalists, are now going out and buying groceries in their own hotel, which is completely away from the Bilderberg Hotel, outside the perimeter, being approached by cops in the car park, and being asked to search their vehicle, and basically asked questions, asked for their passport again.
[00:41:59.728 --> 00:42:10.152]  They've kind of restricted the security perimeter somewhat, but they're still harassing journalists to an even greater extent, which again proves that this is the real center of power.
[00:42:10.152 --> 00:42:19.797]  They're really nervous about anything whatsoever leaking out of this conference because it holds more sway than the G7 puppet show.
[00:42:19.797 --> 00:42:25.339]  We debated this year going to Bilderberg because we have exposed it, we already have sources, we know their agenda.
[00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:35.075]  We were able to report remotely, and it's very expensive to send three reporters, but I decided to do it because we're really beginning to have victory over these people.
[00:42:35.075 --> 00:42:42.859]  They understand that informationally, if we can identify them to the public, it begins to move them into check and then checkmate.
[00:42:42.859 --> 00:42:43.840]  That's why they're so desperate.
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:46.863]  They've been indicted before for Lockheed scandals.
[00:42:46.863 --> 00:42:50.106]  They've been indicted in World Wildlife Fund scams.
[00:42:50.106 --> 00:42:52.489]  I mean, this is really a nasty group.
[00:42:52.489 --> 00:42:55.412]  This is Mafia 2.0.
[00:42:55.412 --> 00:42:58.094]  But really, what's new is really old.
[00:42:58.094 --> 00:42:59.756]  This is the original Mafia.
[00:42:59.756 --> 00:43:02.679]  This is the proto-Mafia.
[00:43:02.679 --> 00:43:05.002]  And they cannot survive exposure.
[00:43:06.308 --> 00:43:15.813]  But if you look at how they're behaving here, it just shows that they can't help but act authoritarian because it's their arrogant, disconnected nature.
[00:43:15.813 --> 00:43:25.599]  So many years, people that work at the hotel won't talk to us when we go into the hotel a week before, days before, but then after the Bilderberg group is so rude to them,
[00:43:26.599 --> 00:43:33.681]  They will then come and meet with us at local pubs or other hangouts and give us the intel we need.
[00:43:33.681 --> 00:43:37.741]  That's why they don't let us in a week, a week and a half before at the hotel now.
[00:43:37.741 --> 00:43:45.563]  It's why they've got a security perimeter miles and miles out because they know we're doing old-fashioned journalism of, hey, listen, here's a nice tip for dinner.
[00:43:45.563 --> 00:43:48.224]  You're going to have some really evil people here in a week.
[00:43:48.224 --> 00:43:49.004]  They'll look at you weird.
[00:43:49.004 --> 00:43:50.324]  I can't talk to you about that.
[00:43:50.324 --> 00:43:51.464]  Well, just listen.
[00:43:51.464 --> 00:43:53.725]  When they won't let you look them in the eyes, when you hear them talking about
[00:43:54.065 --> 00:44:01.267]  Planetary tyranny and when they're really rude to you and hateful and don't tip you, just know these are the global mafia.
[00:44:01.267 --> 00:44:02.587]  Google Bilderberg.
[00:44:02.587 --> 00:44:03.447]  Do your research.
[00:44:03.447 --> 00:44:09.288]  Decide what's best to do and if you just want to let these criminals get away with this or if you want to give us information.
[00:44:09.288 --> 00:44:11.409]  And we will always get incredible information.
[00:44:11.409 --> 00:44:16.310]  To the point we're followed at all times by spooks when we're there.
[00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:17.830]  Jim Tucker is followed continually.
[00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:19.370]  They wait outside his hotel room.
[00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:20.851]  They break in his hotel room.
[00:44:20.851 --> 00:44:22.091]  They bug his hotel room.
[00:44:23.314 --> 00:44:30.943]  So that's why they're trying to keep you back because they are deathly afraid that we're going to learn about the criminal activities going on inside.
[00:44:30.943 --> 00:44:31.384]  Paul Watson.
[00:44:32.847 --> 00:44:45.037]  No, they're kind of flipping back to the model they had in Greece, I think it was Voulameni 2009, where they literally, you know, followed people around the town, secret spies, following them in and out of their hotels.
[00:44:45.037 --> 00:44:46.599]  You know, that blew up in their faces.
[00:44:46.599 --> 00:44:49.141]  After that, they kind of relented a bit.
[00:44:49.141 --> 00:44:54.686]  Watford and Copenhagen was very much more relaxed, so they now seem to be flipping back to that paradigm where
[00:44:55.226 --> 00:44:59.896]  They're completely paranoid about journalists getting anywhere near this conference.
[00:44:59.896 --> 00:45:03.583]  Because this, again, is where the real power is wielded.
[00:45:03.583 --> 00:45:06.609]  We got more information on the agenda coming out.
[00:45:07.811 --> 00:45:14.836]  Klaus Kleinfeld, who is the head of Alcoa, he is there representing the Business Roundtable.
[00:45:14.836 --> 00:45:32.390]  Now, of course, from the Bilderberg's official website they claim that they're not discussing the TPP, which is complete nonsense because, you know, there are numerous heads of major corporations there right as this deal is set to be authorised with a fast track with the TPA, which could come down as soon as Thursday.
[00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:35.232]  So Klaus Kleinfeld, who is a regular Bilderberg attendee,
[00:45:35.932 --> 00:45:39.114]  He represents the Business Roundtable.
[00:45:39.114 --> 00:45:48.239]  Now if you go on the Business Roundtable Group's website, basically 75% of it is devoted to lobbying for the passage of the TPP.
[00:45:48.239 --> 00:45:55.582]  The people involved in the Business Roundtable control $7.2 trillion in annual revenue.
[00:45:55.582 --> 00:46:01.385]  And he's there lobbying on their behalf with all these finance ministers, with these heads of state at Bilderberg.
[00:46:01.385 --> 00:46:04.547]  So again, you know, just a talking shop, nothing going on there.
[00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:06.831]  Also ISIS.
[00:46:06.831 --> 00:46:13.035]  In the news today we've seen, it was top of the Drudge Report earlier today, ISIS planning dirty bomb.
[00:46:13.035 --> 00:46:16.597]  Obviously we have John Allen attending Bilderberg this year.
[00:46:16.597 --> 00:46:21.320]  He's the specialist head of combating ISIS for the US.
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:28.705]  Again, allied with the release of this Pentagon document which said that they knew arming jihadists in Syria and Libya
[00:46:29.085 --> 00:46:29.706]  We're good to go.
[00:46:47.685 --> 00:46:50.547]  We've got Ryanair's Michael O'Leary.
[00:46:50.547 --> 00:47:02.153]  The Independent wrote a kind of sophomoric jokey article about how the fact that Michael O'Leary is there means that this is nonsense and because he's seen as quite an ostentatious character in the United Kingdom.
[00:47:02.153 --> 00:47:09.116]  But he's been a public advocate, aggressively, of the United Kingdom staying in the European Union.
[00:47:09.116 --> 00:47:16.300]  So he's going to be there talking, discussing about how to discredit the out campaign when that vote on the EU referendum
[00:47:17.489 --> 00:47:18.150]  We're good to go.
[00:47:33.051 --> 00:47:34.611]  Other takes on this?
[00:47:34.611 --> 00:47:38.973]  I mean, the media response has been generally much improved this year.
[00:47:38.973 --> 00:47:51.836]  I remember back in 2013 in Watford, the BBC reporter, the blonde woman who interviewed you, was standing literally 500 yards from where they were meeting and she said it was, quote, a conspiracy theory.
[00:47:51.836 --> 00:47:54.376]  She said, isn't this just a big conspiracy theory?
[00:47:54.376 --> 00:47:57.157]  Today the BBC released a very fair article
[00:47:57.737 --> 00:48:12.826]  Basically admitting that this group does have power, a raft of different influential people there, and generally so far the media coverage has given Bilderberg the credence and the importance it deserves in comparison to previous years.
[00:48:15.245 --> 00:48:24.248]  It's a real G7 meeting, not a public PR deception meeting, where they hand out goody bags, as you were saying.
[00:48:24.248 --> 00:48:33.892]  And once they admit that this stuff's going on, everyone's been told for 60 years there are no elites, ultra-rich don't meet in secret.
[00:48:33.892 --> 00:48:36.153]  Once people start paying attention to this, instead of
[00:48:38.229 --> 00:48:41.611]  The Kardashian dad putting on a dress.
[00:48:41.611 --> 00:49:03.888]  It is game over and I keep hammering that this is a secret illegal taxpayer-funded Lobbying meeting with all the key players of the Anglo-American establishment haggling over fine-tuning their takeover And how to sell fraudulent elections, let's face it That's what they do.
[00:49:03.888 --> 00:49:07.291]  They aren't going to meet on how to discredit
[00:49:08.632 --> 00:49:11.394]  The vote to get out of the EU for the UK.
[00:49:11.394 --> 00:49:17.858]  They're figuring out how to make it look like Scotland didn't really vote to stay.
[00:49:17.858 --> 00:49:23.702]  That the UK isn't going to vote to stay, or that it is going to.
[00:49:23.702 --> 00:49:28.505]  They're there basically figuring out how to bamboozle people, but it's not going to work forever, Paul.
[00:49:30.666 --> 00:49:38.694]  It's not going to work forever because a bigger and bigger spotlight is being shined on this conference and again that's testified to by the media coverage.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:44.383]  The fact that Bilderberg is taking place after the G7 is important.
[00:49:44.383 --> 00:49:56.172]  It normally takes place before, which suggests this year they're not only setting the consensus, which G7 then kind of rubber stamps, but they're actually making the final decisions on a lot of these issues.
[00:49:56.172 --> 00:50:00.756]  And a key one is related to ISIS, because from the information we've got,
[00:50:01.385 --> 00:50:07.569]  They're going to trump up this ISIS threat, which is a genuine threat because it was created by arming those jihadists in the first place.
[00:50:07.569 --> 00:50:13.372]  But they're going to use it to target, quote, terror financing, which means economic totalitarianism.
[00:50:13.372 --> 00:50:20.317]  And that's their excuse to take over the internet, take over all transactions and kill cash, which they have all their CEOs publicly promoting right now.
[00:50:22.113 --> 00:50:26.936]  Yeah, and the very fact they would even entertain banning cash.
[00:50:26.936 --> 00:50:29.558]  I mean, from my perspective, it's never going to happen.
[00:50:29.558 --> 00:50:31.560]  There would be a worldwide revolt against it.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:38.845]  But the mere fact they're considering it and promoting it is testament to their extreme... What they're going to do is it's going to be quasi-illegal.
[00:50:38.845 --> 00:50:43.668]  It'll be legal, but they're going to act like it's illegal with asset forfeiture, seizure, and the rest of it.
[00:50:43.668 --> 00:50:44.589]  I mean, look at this headline.
[00:50:44.589 --> 00:50:48.111]  Clearing your browser history can be deemed obstruction of justice in the U.S.
[00:50:48.111 --> 00:50:48.772]  Stay there, Paul.
[00:50:49.864 --> 00:50:59.383]  I want to talk more about what you predict is going to happen with the security forces and the rest of it, because this is all a microcosm of the larger global police state Bilderberg is establishing.
[00:50:59.383 --> 00:50:59.824]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.297 --> 00:51:03.418]  So the phone rings, and I pick it up, and it's Mark.
[00:51:03.418 --> 00:51:08.781]  And Mark says to me, hey, third Sunday, June, Father's Day, I ordered Dad a gun.
[00:51:08.781 --> 00:51:09.681]  It's here.
[00:51:09.681 --> 00:51:12.422]  He's going to build it out, and we're going to go out on Father's Day shooting.
[00:51:12.422 --> 00:51:13.043]  You want to come?
[00:51:13.043 --> 00:51:13.963]  And I said, yeah.
[00:51:13.963 --> 00:51:18.806]  What a great idea for a Father's Day gift, an AR-15 rifle kit from Guns80.com.
[00:51:18.806 --> 00:51:19.846]  I think I'll get my dad one.
[00:51:19.846 --> 00:51:20.806]  He says, go ahead.
[00:51:20.806 --> 00:51:21.567]  See you out on the range.
[00:51:21.567 --> 00:51:23.468]  So we're going to meet on the range on Father's Day.
[00:51:23.468 --> 00:51:26.929]  Get your dad an AR-15 rifle kit at Guns80.com, Guns80.com, or call 844-2GUNS80.
[00:51:30.945 --> 00:51:39.848]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[00:51:39.848 --> 00:51:40.949]  Silver Lungs.

[00:52:00.436 --> 00:52:04.661]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:52:04.661 --> 00:52:05.301]  It's true.
[00:52:05.301 --> 00:52:09.446]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:52:09.446 --> 00:52:11.848]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:52:11.848 --> 00:52:16.313]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[00:52:16.613 --> 00:52:29.497]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:44.541]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:39.122]  Thank you.
[00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:17.216]  We're going to go back to Paul Watson for the rest of this segment and the next and I'll talk for one segment with Josh Owens and of course Rob Dewey to get their take on what they've seen break down.
[00:54:17.216 --> 00:54:23.320]  We know about LeBron James may leave Cleveland to a new victory.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:24.401]  What does it matter at the end of the day?
[00:54:24.401 --> 00:54:25.841]  Nothing.
[00:54:25.841 --> 00:54:29.144]  We know about Kim Kardashian's stepdad wearing a dress.
[00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:37.058]  Meanwhile, the global elite are putting fluoride in the water to brain damages and writing books how they do it, laughing at us, like eco-science.
[00:54:37.058 --> 00:54:39.941]  The White House science czar wrote a book admitting it.
[00:54:39.941 --> 00:54:44.246]  How they do it to brain damages and reduce our fertility.
[00:54:44.246 --> 00:54:47.590]  But see, that's not as cool as LeBron James, because people have been drinking fluoride.
[00:54:49.315 --> 00:54:53.336]  And it just comes down to we are identifying the real world.
[00:54:53.336 --> 00:54:56.338]  They put us in this media fantasy land and laugh at us.
[00:54:56.338 --> 00:55:00.039]  I'm coming out of the media fantasy land going, look at this!
[00:55:00.039 --> 00:55:03.260]  And you can see more and more we're able to really wake people up.
[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:12.823]  Briefly, we've got specials that run every week, but we might go six months before we offer a special, say, on water filters.
[00:55:12.823 --> 00:55:16.505]  We're offering what I think is the best deal that we've ever
[00:55:17.739 --> 00:55:20.280]  Offered on the Pro Pure Pitcher.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:28.182]  Now, it is normally $69.95 with the super high quality, high powered filter that cuts out the glyphosates, the fluoride, you name it.
[00:55:28.182 --> 00:55:37.204]  Comparable pitchers that you get at major stores just have charcoal and take out the bad taste and reduce stuff a little bit.
[00:55:37.204 --> 00:55:41.265]  This is the best system for the price out there.
[00:55:41.265 --> 00:55:42.506]  It's almost as good as their $200 systems.
[00:55:44.771 --> 00:55:49.214]  It's the Pro-1 G2.0 filter that is just amazing.
[00:55:49.214 --> 00:55:50.635]  The all-in-one filter.
[00:55:50.635 --> 00:55:52.096]  It's what I use when I'm on the road.
[00:55:52.096 --> 00:55:55.799]  We use it also right here in the office.
[00:55:55.799 --> 00:55:56.939]  It's amazing.
[00:55:56.939 --> 00:56:00.041]  It's $55.95 right now.
[00:56:00.041 --> 00:56:01.683]  That's 20% off.
[00:56:01.683 --> 00:56:04.725]  We're running the special through next Wednesday.
[00:56:04.725 --> 00:56:07.707]  And then we will not offer this special for another year.
[00:56:08.601 --> 00:56:10.826]  And we had to get special authorization to do this.
[00:56:10.826 --> 00:56:12.630]  We already have the lowest prices.
[00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:14.174]  We have a signed contract with the maker.
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:18.562]  We are the main global distributor because we offer such low prices.
[00:56:18.562 --> 00:56:23.426]  We had to really push to get this because, well, it's joke level.
[00:56:23.426 --> 00:56:27.548]  I mean, it basically cuts out almost all their profit and all of ours, but it's a loss leader.
[00:56:27.548 --> 00:56:32.452]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:56:32.452 --> 00:56:41.057]  And if you can't afford or you don't want the stainless steel model that's bigger and takes maybe a minute to put together, this takes no time to put together.
[00:56:41.057 --> 00:56:44.700]  It's just great to take to work, great to have in your truck, great to take camping.
[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:49.182]  It also funds the operation and sending our reporters around the world.
[00:56:49.182 --> 00:56:50.783]  So it's a win-win-win, 360 win.
[00:56:50.783 --> 00:56:53.044]  Anything I do, I look at it.
[00:56:53.044 --> 00:56:54.865]  Do I feel good about what I'm promoting?
[00:56:54.865 --> 00:57:00.028]  Does it make my conscience really feel ecstatic?
[00:57:00.028 --> 00:57:02.810]  Not just okay, but wow, I feel good doing this.
[00:57:02.810 --> 00:57:05.051]  I'm high on that, folks.
[00:57:05.051 --> 00:57:06.912]  I mean, that's my philosophy.
[00:57:06.912 --> 00:57:08.853]  And I know a lot of people have that philosophy.
[00:57:08.853 --> 00:57:10.614]  Just the globalists have the opposite philosophy.
[00:57:10.614 --> 00:57:12.115]  That's important we point that out.
[00:57:13.814 --> 00:57:17.398]  You know, I like to give pleasure, not hurt.
[00:57:17.398 --> 00:57:20.180]  But I also want to smash the heads in of tyrants.
[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:21.522]  And I'll do it politically.
[00:57:21.522 --> 00:57:25.226]  We have to have that sheepdog instinct, though, to want to defend as well.
[00:57:26.488 --> 00:57:32.592]  InfowarStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:32.592 --> 00:57:36.954]  Simply the best water filtration system in the entire family.
[00:57:36.954 --> 00:57:38.275]  Biggest discounts ever.
[00:57:38.275 --> 00:57:40.256]  InfowarStore.com.
[00:57:40.256 --> 00:57:41.817]  Now, we're going to go to break in about a minute and a half.
[00:57:41.817 --> 00:57:43.278]  I want to come back to Watson.
[00:57:43.278 --> 00:57:44.839]  What are you going to cover in the next segment?
[00:57:44.839 --> 00:57:46.560]  What else have you not gotten to?
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:48.781]  And what are you expecting to happen this year?
[00:57:48.781 --> 00:57:50.722]  And what do you think the flavor of this year is?
[00:57:50.722 --> 00:57:54.764]  I agree they're rebranding tyranny, the next step of their takeover.
[00:57:54.764 --> 00:57:55.365]  But what else?
[00:57:55.925 --> 00:57:56.686]  Crystallizes 2015.
[00:58:14.103 --> 00:58:19.065]  Um, again, 2012, 1.9 billion dollar fine for the same thing.
[00:58:19.065 --> 00:58:30.831]  Yet, three of the top people from HSBC are now at Bilderberg, or will be tomorrow, including the head of the BBC Trust, talking about how to restrict, squeeze the middle class.
[00:58:31.551 --> 00:58:39.295]  So, we need to be watched, we need to be surveilled in terms of finances, because we might be cheating on our taxes, yet they're laundering money.
[00:58:39.295 --> 00:58:46.479]  And they're above the law, and they run the narcotics aircraft that's come out, and of course they ply drugs out, little kids out.
[00:58:46.479 --> 00:58:48.520]  These are some nasty people.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:49.281]  We'll be back, stay with us.
[00:58:50.922 --> 00:59:07.587]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[00:59:07.587 --> 00:59:11.088]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[00:59:11.448 --> 00:59:15.491]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:59:15.491 --> 00:59:17.032]  HDfirearms.com.
[00:59:17.032 --> 00:59:20.355]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, special ops people.
[00:59:20.355 --> 00:59:25.479]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[00:59:25.479 --> 00:59:29.422]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[00:59:29.422 --> 00:59:31.784]  Go to their website, HDfirearms.com.
[00:59:31.784 --> 00:59:36.187]  Buy right off their website, and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice.
[00:59:36.187 --> 00:59:37.688]  You can pick it up at the gun show, you can
[00:59:37.688 --> 00:59:38.708]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:07.028 --> 01:00:11.870]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:13.451]  You want answers?
[01:00:13.451 --> 01:00:14.992]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.992 --> 01:00:19.193]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:19.193 --> 01:00:23.255]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.837 --> 01:00:30.078]  We are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:30.078 --> 01:00:33.999]  The second hour after our reporters leave us in about 15 minutes.
[01:00:33.999 --> 01:00:36.600]  I'm going to go over the economic news.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:39.482]  Dow Jones Industrial Average struggles to maintain gains.
[01:00:39.482 --> 01:00:41.122]  We're going to break down what I think is behind that.
[01:00:41.122 --> 01:00:45.104]  The latest out of control gains by ISIS in Syria and Iraq.
[01:00:45.104 --> 01:00:49.005]  It's just with our government financing the whole thing publicly.
[01:00:49.005 --> 01:00:50.006]  The Iraqis all know it.
[01:00:50.006 --> 01:00:51.446]  Their governments presented the evidence.
[01:00:51.446 --> 01:00:53.167]  Our military knows it and has tried to expose it.
[01:00:55.672 --> 01:00:58.996]  The elite really are bold.
[01:00:58.996 --> 01:01:00.177]  Paul Watson, finishing up.
[01:01:00.177 --> 01:01:03.581]  You've got the floor for the next four minutes on the Bilderberg agenda.
[01:01:03.581 --> 01:01:05.563]  Tell us what you're planning next.
[01:01:05.563 --> 01:01:07.485]  Is Skype just dropped?
[01:01:07.485 --> 01:01:08.966]  We'll reconnect with them.
[01:01:08.966 --> 01:01:09.807]  Great technology.
[01:01:09.807 --> 01:01:12.510]  We've been using Skype since they came out with it.
[01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:13.912]  We were using it back in 2008 at the DNC.
[01:01:18.763 --> 01:01:24.405]  And it's gotten a lot clearer than it used to be, and the audio's gotten better on average, but it drops as much as it ever did.
[01:01:24.405 --> 01:01:26.286]  Alex, I'm just going to mention one thing.
[01:01:26.286 --> 01:01:32.789]  We were watching them shooting a helicopter flying right over, right before it dropped.
[01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:33.849]  You think they may have jamming?
[01:01:33.849 --> 01:01:39.912]  I'm not saying it's absolute, but it would surprise me.
[01:01:39.912 --> 01:01:43.994]  So, were we capturing that, the helicopter flying over?
[01:01:45.555 --> 01:01:46.778]  Could have been on Ustream.
[01:01:46.778 --> 01:01:47.379]  I'm not sure.
[01:01:47.379 --> 01:01:51.329]  I'm sure they caught it on HD though.
[01:01:51.329 --> 01:01:53.454]  Paul, tell us about being buzzed by the helicopter.
[01:01:55.373 --> 01:01:57.615]  Yeah, I think we captured that, yeah.
[01:01:57.615 --> 01:02:01.339]  I'm not sure whether it's surveilling us or what, but yeah, we caught it.
[01:02:01.339 --> 01:02:09.407]  But one other thing is, there are a lot of smaller countries represented here at Bilderberg who are not necessarily part of the, you know, globalist agenda.
[01:02:09.407 --> 01:02:19.217]  So you will get outliers from these smaller countries, like Austria and Finland, attending this conference, which is why Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary General,
[01:02:19.617 --> 01:02:20.838]  And that's really the big news.
[01:02:20.838 --> 01:02:25.002]  They admit that they're moving armor and trainers in to fight the Russians right on their doorstep.
[01:02:25.002 --> 01:02:25.683]  This is just madness.
[01:02:45.267 --> 01:02:47.808]  Yeah, and they want to arm the Ukrainian rebels.
[01:02:47.808 --> 01:02:49.888]  We had the bill in Congress.
[01:02:49.888 --> 01:03:00.252]  Again, McCain and Lindsey Graham introduced it to arm these Ukrainian jihadists who are now on a par with ISIS, you know, with their burning people alive on crosses and hanging people.
[01:03:00.252 --> 01:03:09.014]  Those are the new freedom fighters that they want to arm, so that's going to be under discussion too.
[01:03:09.014 --> 01:03:13.736]  What are you planning, without giving away too much, and then give us your prediction for Bilderberg 2015.
[01:03:16.657 --> 01:03:18.719]  Well, obviously they're going to start arriving tomorrow.
[01:03:18.719 --> 01:03:25.524]  Normally it's late morning, so we've just got to find a good spot to get some of the cars coming in.
[01:03:25.524 --> 01:03:27.605]  Also, we're talking about another location.
[01:03:27.605 --> 01:03:34.871]  Don't want to divulge too much information, but we're looking at several different locations to catch them coming in to get the best shots.
[01:03:36.052 --> 01:03:42.156]  As far as people here, I met somebody in the airport coming through who was attending, so we'll see how many people.
[01:03:42.156 --> 01:03:45.598]  Last year in Copenhagen it wasn't so many, that was in a major city obviously.
[01:03:45.598 --> 01:03:46.839]  Did you talk to him at the airport?
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:53.564]  Yeah, I met him in Copenhagen last year and he was from Poland, so he was flying from London too.
[01:03:53.564 --> 01:04:02.731]  He says that, you know, other Polish people are going to be there, so there should be at least a smattering of, you know, independent media and hopefully a lot of protesters.
[01:04:02.731 --> 01:04:06.774]  Okay, so you ran into somebody who's media or a demonstrator, not someone who's part of Bilderberg?
[01:04:07.608 --> 01:04:21.679]  Well, actually, I was on the plane with somebody who was speaking in a very Bilderberg-esque tone, talking about how the UK serfs shouldn't even have the right to vote to get out of the EU, and, you know, he looked like he could be part of Bilderberg, maybe one of their aides.
[01:04:21.679 --> 01:04:36.310]  Well, let's remember, they have about 130, quote, members, usually about 10, 15 special guests, but hundreds of minions that kind of carry the brain bugs around, and so they're going to be crawling all over the place arrogantly as well.
[01:04:38.684 --> 01:04:45.368]  And another thing is who is going to attend who is not on the list because of course in 2008 it was Obama and Hillary Clinton.
[01:04:45.368 --> 01:04:47.169]  Numerous other individuals have attended.
[01:04:47.169 --> 01:04:49.510]  They've been photographed but not on the official list.
[01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:56.193]  And that's why they don't want us to know when they're coming in and the best thing will be obviously getting when they get off the airplanes on their private jets.
[01:04:56.193 --> 01:04:57.154]  Paul, thank you so much.
[01:04:57.154 --> 01:04:59.075]  We'll talk to you more when I come back with other reporters.
[01:05:01.573 --> 01:05:05.477]  Checkpoints, harassment, and Cobra Commandos.
[01:05:05.477 --> 01:05:08.741]  This is not your granddaddy's smoke-filled room.
[01:05:08.741 --> 01:05:11.864]  This is Bilderberg 2015.
[01:05:11.864 --> 01:05:19.933]  Every year, the Bilderberg Confab tweaks its efforts to lock out the media, deny transparency, and keep its agenda secret.
[01:05:20.894 --> 01:05:36.660]  Similar to the 6.2-mile exclusion zone around the radioactive Chernobyl plant, Austrian Federal Police have set up a similar-sized zone to keep the public away from the hotel where over 150 world leaders will meet in secret.
[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:45.824]  InfoWars reporters were stopped at a checkpoint, had their vehicles searched, and even had police come to the front door of their hotel room.
[01:05:46.505 --> 01:05:53.718]  All in the name of keeping their cameras away from the 150 world leaders attempting to meet in secret.
[01:05:53.718 --> 01:05:58.786]  We'll have continual coverage of Bilderberg on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:20.006]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[01:06:20.006 --> 01:06:20.426]  Well then,
[01:06:20.766 --> 01:06:24.827]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:06:24.827 --> 01:06:26.368]  hdfirearms.com.
[01:06:26.368 --> 01:06:34.810]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people, they're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[01:06:34.810 --> 01:06:38.751]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.

[01:07:00.222 --> 01:07:07.107]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[01:08:08.635 --> 01:08:10.037]  Bilderberg 2015.
[01:08:10.037 --> 01:08:16.684]  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
[01:08:16.684 --> 01:08:18.707]  We must be cautious in Austria.
[01:08:32.503 --> 01:08:36.426]  It was easier to control a million people, literally.
[01:08:36.426 --> 01:08:44.453]  It was easier to control a million people than physically to kill a million people.
[01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:50.858]  Today, it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people.
[01:08:59.554 --> 01:09:01.497]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:09:01.497 --> 01:09:05.543]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:34.653]  This is an emergency transmission from FEMA Region 6 in occupied North America.
[01:09:34.653 --> 01:09:36.513]  That's not rhetoric.
[01:09:36.513 --> 01:09:38.514]  That's truth.
[01:09:38.514 --> 01:09:54.601]  We won't be able to defeat the globalists if we can't admit they've taken over the infrastructure, they've taken over the megabanks, they control the currency, they're waging war on our families, and now they're getting ready to get rid of the free speech and the private property and all the rest of it.
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:59.382]  They could never do that before because they couldn't selectively enforce it all.
[01:09:59.382 --> 01:10:05.385]  Now through carbon taxes and the cashless society, they openly say that they're going to be able to do this.
[01:10:05.385 --> 01:10:08.867]  It is going to be insane.
[01:10:08.867 --> 01:10:22.814]  And to stop us from getting together, they're engineering massive class warfare and are going to sick the giant mobs of welfare heads on the paramilitary police the globalists set up to take the fall.
[01:10:24.912 --> 01:10:34.134]  I mean, you can see the problem-reaction-solution philosophy of the New World Order in everything they do.
[01:10:34.134 --> 01:10:34.774]  And we're here.
[01:10:34.774 --> 01:10:36.894]  We've reverse-engineered the whole thing.
[01:10:36.894 --> 01:10:39.715]  I'm not bragging.
[01:10:39.715 --> 01:10:44.615]  We've reverse-engineered the whole stinking mess with our field of experts.
[01:10:44.615 --> 01:10:49.896]  We can pretty much predict the next thing the globals are going to do because we're inside their operation.
[01:10:49.896 --> 01:10:52.717]  We've infiltrated everything they run and control.
[01:10:54.568 --> 01:10:59.112]  But their entire attack operation is based on a dumbed-down public.
[01:10:59.112 --> 01:11:04.517]  So it's kind of like we got the glasses from They Live, we can see the general public can't.
[01:11:04.517 --> 01:11:07.740]  We're here trying to get people to just put the glasses on.
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:14.867]  And to use the Rowdy Piper allegory from They Live, you gotta fight the public sometimes to get them to put the glasses on.
[01:11:14.867 --> 01:11:18.511]  But once you put the glasses on, or once you take the red pill,
[01:11:19.878 --> 01:11:21.719]  You can't be told about the New World Order.
[01:11:21.719 --> 01:11:23.561]  You gotta see it for yourself.
[01:11:23.561 --> 01:11:27.844]  And once you see it, you'll say, how did I not understand that before?
[01:11:27.844 --> 01:11:29.185]  Because the con game.
[01:11:29.185 --> 01:11:30.366]  There is no secret government.
[01:11:30.366 --> 01:11:31.627]  There is no shadow government.
[01:11:31.627 --> 01:11:33.108]  There are no death panels.
[01:11:33.108 --> 01:11:35.831]  It decreases your prices.
[01:11:35.831 --> 01:11:37.472]  We're not coming after your guns.
[01:11:37.472 --> 01:11:38.112]  We love you.
[01:11:38.112 --> 01:11:39.393]  2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:11:41.345 --> 01:11:43.086]  You didn't build your business.
[01:11:43.086 --> 01:11:48.871]  And when you're faced with a wall of lies, you either accept them or you admit you're in deep trouble.
[01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:52.094]  And people are fundamentally lazy.
[01:11:52.094 --> 01:11:54.636]  We've been kept comfortable while having our real freedoms taken.
[01:11:54.636 --> 01:12:01.321]  We've been given the baubles, the trinkets, the signets of success while we're being undermined.
[01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:03.002]  And people don't want to hear they're in deep trouble.
[01:12:03.002 --> 01:12:09.808]  They don't want to hear there's a shadowy evil group putting cancer viruses and vaccines and fluoride in the water and writing books about how they're doing it and laughing at us.
[01:12:11.499 --> 01:12:15.305]  I can play a PBS thing with one of the developers of the Salk vaccine with Salk.
[01:12:15.305 --> 01:12:20.653]  Top doctor going, yeah we knew the cancer virus was an all in it and it was going to kill tens of millions, but there's too many people!
[01:12:20.653 --> 01:12:25.821]  You know, I mean I know why you're afraid.
[01:12:25.821 --> 01:12:27.122]  I've been afraid too.
[01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:32.132]  But I'm like a struggling person being held underwater.
[01:12:32.132 --> 01:12:33.214]  I'm not afraid at this point.
[01:12:33.214 --> 01:12:36.397]  I'm just struggling with everything I got to get to the surface.
[01:12:36.397 --> 01:12:39.260]  But collectively, I gotta get you to go to the surface with me.
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:40.702]  We're chained together.
[01:12:40.702 --> 01:12:43.225]  We've got enough strength together to swim to the surface.
[01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:44.666]  We can't do it individually.
[01:12:44.666 --> 01:12:46.248]  We're down here with chains on us.
[01:12:46.248 --> 01:12:47.530]  We're only 10 feet under the water.
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:13:06.052]  And if we can just get the public to all jump towards the surface, move towards the edge to climb out, lift the chains up with our arms, kick with our feet, we can hit the top, get the air we need, and get to the dry land.
[01:13:06.052 --> 01:13:13.877]  But I've likened it, and I told Esquire, where they did a profile on me last year, that I liken this to claustrophobia.
[01:13:13.877 --> 01:13:15.338]  I've never been a claustrophobic person.
[01:13:21.704 --> 01:13:34.390]  But now I understand claustrophobia because when I read what the globalists are doing, and I read books they've written, and I watch clips of them on C-SPAN admitting all this horrible stuff, I feel claustrophobic because it's just... I want to warn people!
[01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:35.870]  It's out in the open!
[01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:37.551]  It's horrible!
[01:13:37.551 --> 01:13:40.492]  Why do we have to do this?
[01:13:40.492 --> 01:13:45.835]  They know their MMR shot gives you type 1 diabetes, then they claim it's genetic.
[01:13:47.418 --> 01:13:56.382]  Well, of course it's genetic that if you get hit with an autoimmune response, your pancreas can fail.
[01:13:56.382 --> 01:13:57.102]  It's genetic.
[01:13:57.102 --> 01:14:07.707]  If you smoke three packs of cigarettes and you're predisposed to get lung cancer, you're going to get it.
[01:14:07.707 --> 01:14:12.929]  Yes, genetically, I can't take six or seven 357 rounds into my heart.
[01:14:12.929 --> 01:14:13.850]  Probably couldn't take one.
[01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:24.474]  I guess you could breed some breed of human that had a heart that could take a couple gunshots.
[01:14:24.474 --> 01:14:30.258]  But it's not the genetics making you die when a bullet goes through your heart, it's the bullet.
[01:14:30.258 --> 01:14:33.300]  We're being murdered by a scientific elite, slowly.
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.301]  They're laughing at us.
[01:14:34.301 --> 01:14:36.382]  They're criminals.
[01:14:36.382 --> 01:14:46.450]  And they had such control of the horror media for so long that they could have these secret confabs, not just this one, but other events, trilateral commission meetings, you name it, and they would have people go on radio
[01:14:47.364 --> 01:14:54.050]  Our friends and say, oh it's crazy there's no such thing as a Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:59.014]  There's no such thing as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:14:59.014 --> 01:15:04.699]  I don't know how you know these things and don't tell people.
[01:15:04.699 --> 01:15:09.463]  But it's the analogy I talked about or the example I talked about last week.
[01:15:09.463 --> 01:15:14.808]  I can go out to these firms and I can install software and systems that scan people's cookies
[01:15:16.624 --> 01:15:26.969]  And then I can change the algorithm to know what people will pay and what they won't pay off their past surfing history of other people's sites by subscribing to that database.
[01:15:26.969 --> 01:15:30.610]  And then I can have the numbers change when they come in and gouge people.
[01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:35.713]  In fact, they have face scanning cameras that came out a decade ago.
[01:15:35.713 --> 01:15:39.514]  And a lot of these big elite stores already have your face scan from the DMV database.
[01:15:39.514 --> 01:15:40.575]  They bought it from the feds.
[01:15:41.727 --> 01:15:45.128]  And then it will see who you are and then jack up prices accordingly.
[01:15:45.128 --> 01:15:46.588]  And you ask, well, how do they do that?
[01:15:46.588 --> 01:15:50.409]  They have price tags.
[01:15:50.409 --> 01:15:52.869]  Well, notice a lot of high-end stores now don't have price tags.
[01:15:52.869 --> 01:16:02.631]  And then they'll have a little handheld computer, a little iPhone when they walk over and they'll tell you what stuff costs while they're looking down at it.
[01:16:02.631 --> 01:16:07.712]  And I could do that and fix all of our funding problems and have plenty of money to do everything I want, but I won't do that.
[01:16:09.008 --> 01:16:10.288]  Because that's a screw job.
[01:16:10.288 --> 01:16:12.369]  Well, see, the elite would say, well, you're not Machiavelli.
[01:16:12.369 --> 01:16:15.389]  Because they say the end justifies the means.
[01:16:15.389 --> 01:16:18.310]  But your end is evil as well.
[01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:24.251]  We know the end doesn't justify the means because that always leads to corruption and collapse.
[01:16:24.251 --> 01:16:29.292]  Evil sells good men and women on doing corrupt things for the greater good.
[01:16:29.292 --> 01:16:31.232]  And we know where that gets us.
[01:16:31.232 --> 01:16:35.013]  But who's the chief pusher of this idea of real politic?
[01:16:35.013 --> 01:16:36.373]  Henry Kissinger.
[01:16:36.373 --> 01:16:37.413]  Let's go to Josh
[01:16:38.746 --> 01:16:42.509]  Owens reporting from right outside the security perimeter in Austria.
[01:16:42.509 --> 01:16:50.294]  They're promising two weeks in jail and a 500 euro fine if you step foot inside the giant exclusion zone.
[01:16:50.294 --> 01:16:52.456]  We'll put that article up on air for TV viewers.
[01:16:52.456 --> 01:16:54.918]  The article's on Infowars.com.
[01:16:54.918 --> 01:16:56.999]  And it is a massive perimeter.
[01:16:56.999 --> 01:17:03.524]  There's no way people won't even know that they're getting into this when they go into this perimeter.
[01:17:03.524 --> 01:17:05.345]  But they stop you miles out.
[01:17:05.345 --> 01:17:06.446]  Josh, thank you for joining us.
[01:17:07.694 --> 01:17:09.135]  Hey Alex, this is actually Rob Dew.
[01:17:09.135 --> 01:17:10.155]  Okay.
[01:17:10.155 --> 01:17:13.216]  It takes a little bit of time to switch that stuff out and we didn't have time.
[01:17:13.216 --> 01:17:17.658]  Okay, well I've said, I'm not mad, just be clear, I've said Josh and then you, but that's fine, go ahead.
[01:17:17.658 --> 01:17:18.658]  Okay.
[01:17:18.658 --> 01:17:24.541]  Actually, where the perimeter is runs into the backyard area of where our location is.
[01:17:24.541 --> 01:17:29.983]  So it is really far, at least a mile in diameter going around the Interalpen Hotel.
[01:17:29.983 --> 01:17:37.186]  This is Rob Dew reporting live from Mosern, Austria, about halfway up the mountain between the village of Telfs and Buchen.
[01:17:38.051 --> 01:17:42.995]  Austria up top of the mountain where the Interalpen Hotel is.
[01:17:42.995 --> 01:17:46.678]  And so today we pretty much I think called a truce with the cops.
[01:17:46.678 --> 01:17:49.000]  They are not badgering us as much.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.422]  They're letting us go through the checkpoints quicker.
[01:17:51.422 --> 01:17:53.884]  And I've agreed not to film them essentially.
[01:17:53.884 --> 01:17:59.089]  Even though one of them came up to us at one point and said, are you the guys making the YouTube videos?
[01:17:59.089 --> 01:18:00.490]  I said, yeah.
[01:18:00.490 --> 01:18:00.970]  Yeah, we are.
[01:18:00.970 --> 01:18:02.031]  He said, are you filming now?
[01:18:02.031 --> 01:18:05.934]  I said, yeah, I am for my protection, but I won't put it in your face as long as you leave us alone.
[01:18:07.148 --> 01:18:10.829]  They looked at our passports and let us go through the checkpoint.
[01:18:10.829 --> 01:18:20.572]  So I think that era of the story here at Bilderberg 2015 has ended and now we can concentrate more on what these globalists are doing.
[01:18:20.572 --> 01:18:29.075]  Dealing with this stuff so much I didn't have time to make my full photo dossier and yesterday we were having lunch and later on I'm working on a report and the next thing I know
[01:18:29.969 --> 01:18:31.749]  I'm looking at a guy that we had lunch next to.
[01:18:31.749 --> 01:18:40.391]  It was Alexander Stubb, who is listed on the Bilderberg site as the Prime Minister of Finland, but on Wikipedia he's listed as the Finance Minister.
[01:18:40.391 --> 01:18:42.651]  So regardless though, he was there.
[01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:44.232]  I noticed him as we were sitting.
[01:18:44.232 --> 01:18:47.112]  He didn't look like a big politician or anything.
[01:18:47.112 --> 01:18:50.733]  He was there with three other people in this small little restaurant.
[01:18:50.733 --> 01:18:54.434]  But he reminded me of my brother-in-law, and I pointed him out to Josh.
[01:18:54.434 --> 01:18:56.194]  I said, look, that guy kind of looks like my brother-in-law.
[01:18:56.972 --> 01:19:04.620]  And lo and behold, as I'm putting this report together today, this morning, I realize that that's the guy we're sitting next to during lunch.
[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:09.806]  And I could kick myself for not knowing that earlier and then going to confront him about why he's
[01:19:10.866 --> 01:19:17.550]  Converting with people like Henry Kissinger, the heads of HSBC, and Queen Beatrix, all these eugenicists.
[01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:20.952]  I mean, I don't know how these people can do this in good conscience.
[01:19:20.952 --> 01:19:24.393]  So I wanted to ask him that, if I do see him again down in Telfz.
[01:19:24.393 --> 01:19:29.616]  I tell you, Rob, I can tell why Hitler and the globalists like that area.
[01:19:29.616 --> 01:19:31.457]  It is absolutely gorgeous.
[01:19:31.457 --> 01:19:33.778]  I mean, it is legendary looking.
[01:19:33.778 --> 01:19:36.660]  With those Alps in the background, I'm sure you're just hating this assignment.
[01:19:37.722 --> 01:19:41.444]  No, I actually do love... The people here are very nice.
[01:19:41.444 --> 01:19:42.504]  Everybody here is very polite.
[01:19:42.504 --> 01:19:43.965]  It's very clean.
[01:19:43.965 --> 01:19:46.146]  Everybody here is very respectful.
[01:19:46.146 --> 01:19:47.727]  Except for the police.
[01:19:47.727 --> 01:19:52.669]  We had to deal with the police there in the beginning and then you saw what happened yesterday when we went to the police station.
[01:19:52.669 --> 01:20:00.533]  Which I think was... By the way, we have the footage of them trying to snatch your camera coming up on the other side and your interview with locals.
[01:20:01.178 --> 01:20:04.560]  Did you know some countries are now banning GMO foods?
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.381]  It's true.
[01:20:05.381 --> 01:20:09.564]  That's why for quality storable foods, you need Ready Made Resources.
[01:20:09.564 --> 01:20:15.828]  For over 19 years, we've become the name you can trust for thousands of products, like NuMana Healthy Food Storage.
[01:20:15.828 --> 01:20:19.710]  All NuMana storable foods are non-GMO, non-soy, and gluten-free available.
[01:20:19.710 --> 01:20:25.094]  Call 800-627-3809 or click readymaderesources.com.
[01:20:25.094 --> 01:20:26.795]  Ready Made Resources.
[01:20:26.795 --> 01:20:29.137]  We don't just sell the products, we live it.
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.221]  You know about RVs.
[01:20:32.221 --> 01:20:33.682]  You've heard about bunkers.
[01:20:33.682 --> 01:20:36.444]  But surviving is not recreation.
[01:20:36.444 --> 01:20:39.206]  And man wasn't made to live underground.
[01:20:39.206 --> 01:20:41.368]  Introducing Survivalist Camps.
[01:20:41.368 --> 01:20:44.370]  The ultimate fully functional off-the-grid survival bu-

[01:21:00.591 --> 01:21:09.277]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[01:21:09.477 --> 01:21:10.578]  Silver Lungs.
[01:21:10.578 --> 01:21:17.886]  With the addition of our unique lung delivery system, respiratory infections are targeted directly, where traditional oral administration simply cannot reach.
[01:21:17.886 --> 01:21:23.913]  This pioneering method also preserves the original particle sizes and delivers your silver solution directly into the bloodstream.
[01:21:23.913 --> 01:21:28.058]  See the Silver Lungs generator and lung delivery system at SilverLungs.com.
[01:21:28.058 --> 01:21:29.780]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:39.427]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:21:39.427 --> 01:21:40.207]  This capitalism?
[01:21:40.207 --> 01:21:46.372]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:21:46.372 --> 01:21:50.074]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:21:50.074 --> 01:21:50.995]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.995 --> 01:21:52.396]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:21:52.396 --> 01:21:52.736]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.736 --> 01:21:53.016]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:21:59.781 --> 01:22:04.003]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:04.003 --> 01:22:04.643]  It's true.
[01:22:04.643 --> 01:22:08.785]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:08.785 --> 01:22:11.186]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:11.186 --> 01:22:15.968]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:15.968 --> 01:22:23.332]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA.
[01:22:23.652 --> 01:22:28.835]  Pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[01:22:28.835 --> 01:22:32.638]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[01:22:32.638 --> 01:22:35.280]  The gold standard in water purification.
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:39.603]  And our filters last for years at less than two cents per gallon.
[01:22:39.603 --> 01:22:44.126]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[01:22:52.777 --> 01:23:01.279]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:23:01.279 --> 01:23:04.900]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:06.261]  A pair of scissors.
[01:23:06.261 --> 01:23:12.042]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[01:23:12.042 --> 01:23:14.863]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by
[01:23:15.043 --> 01:23:16.964]  Big name companies has a weakness.
[01:23:16.964 --> 01:23:17.944]  The phone line.
[01:23:17.944 --> 01:23:23.207]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:23:23.207 --> 01:23:27.129]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:23:27.129 --> 01:23:29.990]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:32.891]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[01:23:32.891 --> 01:23:37.233]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[01:23:37.233 --> 01:23:38.333]  Scissors can't cut it.
[01:23:38.333 --> 01:23:40.574]  And that means your home stays safe.
[01:23:40.574 --> 01:23:44.596]  24-7 professional monitoring is under $15 a month with no contract.

[01:23:49.238 --> 01:23:51.259]  Protect your home with the alarm you can trust.
[01:23:51.259 --> 01:23:52.099]  SimpliSafe.

[01:24:07.961 --> 01:24:21.768]  If you go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, up in the right-hand corner is a big, giant, all-seeing-eye pyramid that says Bilderberg 2015.
[01:24:21.768 --> 01:24:26.310]  And this is a nightmare coming true for these guys and gals.
[01:24:27.779 --> 01:24:30.160]  To have the public begin to be aware of them.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:36.323]  I mean, they write books for each other to read about their horrible plans for humanity.
[01:24:36.323 --> 01:24:42.746]  But they know that only the quote intellectual elite read those and then grovel and try to join.
[01:24:42.746 --> 01:24:49.449]  See, so much of the intelligence of the planet just grovels and supplicates themselves before them.
[01:24:50.225 --> 01:25:10.898]  So that, you know, 92-year-old Henry Kissinger can toad-like wave his magic wand at them and, you know, enter them into the sanctums of the elite, as they sit atop trillions and trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars of fiat money they just make up for themselves, while lecturing us all day.
[01:25:10.898 --> 01:25:14.560]  I want to talk to Josh Owens here in the next segment, but talking to Robb Due again.
[01:25:16.412 --> 01:25:18.734]  Rob, we now have the HD footage.
[01:25:18.734 --> 01:25:24.318]  Obviously, it cut out and we had to go to break whenever they were grabbing at your camera.
[01:25:24.318 --> 01:25:27.300]  But we do have a clip of that we're going to play in a moment.
[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:29.822]  I believe we have it queued up to that part.
[01:25:29.822 --> 01:25:38.289]  But it does show how exercising free speech, exercising right of the press, has now forced the police to not act like
[01:25:39.957 --> 01:25:42.500]  When the shoe fits, Nazis.
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:45.043]  Checkpoints, papers, all the rest is garbage.
[01:25:45.043 --> 01:25:47.185]  You cannot film them bugging their eyes out.
[01:25:47.185 --> 01:25:54.634]  I'm not calling them Nazis, I'm just saying it's Nazi-esque and you are in the home of Hitler there and Schwarzenegger there in Austria.
[01:25:56.109 --> 01:25:58.190]  And again, I'm not a germophobe.
[01:25:58.190 --> 01:26:02.812]  I'm a phobe of germs, but in bending words here, I'm not a germaniophobe.
[01:26:02.812 --> 01:26:10.896]  I actually think the culture's neat and nice in many ways, but it really is a stark backdrop to all of this.
[01:26:10.896 --> 01:26:18.000]  And I want to thank all the listeners around the world, from Sweden and Mexico and Russia and the United States and the UK.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.521]  I saw people commenting on InfoWars that did cult.
[01:26:21.081 --> 01:26:25.183]  The state and federal police and said the world is watching.
[01:26:25.183 --> 01:26:27.243]  For me that's another exciting victory.
[01:26:27.243 --> 01:26:34.846]  It shows by going out, not being intimidated, it then invites more press to come and not be scared and more demonstrators.
[01:26:34.846 --> 01:26:42.069]  And so I don't think we'll see 3,500 demonstrators as police estimated back in 2013 north of London.
[01:26:42.069 --> 01:26:44.770]  But I do think that we're going to see some demonstrators out there.
[01:26:44.770 --> 01:26:46.431]  I know you talked to locals too.
[01:26:46.431 --> 01:26:48.832]  They were unhappy with the checkpoints.
[01:26:50.168 --> 01:26:51.209]  Yeah, they definitely were.
[01:26:51.209 --> 01:26:58.017]  And just to go back to yesterday, what we did was, it was genius on your part to suggest that, but we really put them back on their heels.
[01:26:58.017 --> 01:26:58.758]  Oh, come on.
[01:26:58.758 --> 01:27:00.140]  Don't say I'm a genius.
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:01.341]  You're smarter than I am.
[01:27:01.341 --> 01:27:01.962]  It really was.
[01:27:01.962 --> 01:27:07.929]  It was like a media genius going in there live and just putting it in their face and saying, look, we're going to film you whether you like it or not.
[01:27:08.379 --> 01:27:10.901]  Now are you going to keep acting like tyrants or are you going to leave us alone?
[01:27:10.901 --> 01:27:15.604]  Well, you know what, after people calling them and us putting up more videos, they're now leaving us alone.
[01:27:15.604 --> 01:27:16.524]  So it worked.
[01:27:16.524 --> 01:27:21.368]  It totally worked and now we can concentrate on our real job, which is exposing the scum.
[01:27:21.368 --> 01:27:22.589]  But that's how it works.
[01:27:22.589 --> 01:27:25.891]  If you face down the redcoats, they back off.
[01:27:25.891 --> 01:27:28.713]  If you let them go too far, they put you in a FEMA camp.
[01:27:28.713 --> 01:27:32.075]  I mean, historically, we've got to back the police state off or it's game over.
[01:27:33.024 --> 01:27:38.749]  And I tell you what, talking to the youth yesterday, a lot of the older people, they either didn't speak English or didn't really want to talk to us.
[01:27:38.749 --> 01:27:43.552]  But the youth were actually, even if they didn't speak really good English, they could engage us.
[01:27:43.552 --> 01:27:46.194]  And there were times where I had to really school some people.
[01:27:46.194 --> 01:27:50.017]  You know, this one kid I asked, I said, do you think elite's meeting in secret is good?
[01:27:50.017 --> 01:27:50.738]  He goes, secret?
[01:27:50.738 --> 01:27:51.038]  Good.
[01:27:51.038 --> 01:27:52.680]  I'm like, no, it's not good.
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:53.540]  And I had to explain to him why.
[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:55.502]  He probably meant, he thought you meant privacy.
[01:27:57.765 --> 01:27:59.306]  No, I think, I think he understood.
[01:27:59.306 --> 01:28:02.709]  I think he, I think he understood because we talked a little bit before that.
[01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:08.514]  And it was, it was just these, some of these people really had no idea what was going on Bilderberg wise, but they'd gone through the checkpoints.
[01:28:08.514 --> 01:28:11.456]  They just didn't know what it was about, but there were a few people that were awake.
[01:28:11.456 --> 01:28:13.878]  There was a guy wearing a Wu-Tang Clan t-shirt.
[01:28:13.878 --> 01:28:16.100]  It was very outspoken against them.
[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:18.301]  And, uh, you know, just his bravado.
[01:28:18.301 --> 01:28:22.625]  I just admired that it, you know, these people aren't going to just sit down and take it.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:24.321]  And you know, I encourage them.
[01:28:24.321 --> 01:28:26.303]  Go out, talk to your friends about this.
[01:28:26.303 --> 01:28:28.405]  Get some people organized.
[01:28:28.405 --> 01:28:29.866]  There's going to be a protest here this weekend.
[01:28:29.866 --> 01:28:30.687]  Be part of it.
[01:28:30.687 --> 01:28:43.960]  I wonder if what we saw, the locals in Switzerland actually lit torches like something out of a Frankenstein novel and marched up to the castle and then suddenly helicopters were taking off and the elite, a bunch of them left a half day early.
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:47.323]  And then we had a member of the EU Parliament charge in and get beaten up.
[01:28:47.323 --> 01:28:48.244]  I mean, it's been a circus.
[01:28:51.653 --> 01:28:53.174]  That was in Switzerland.
[01:28:53.174 --> 01:28:53.874]  Yeah, it has been.
[01:28:53.874 --> 01:28:55.734]  And that's the kind of things that need to happen.
[01:28:55.734 --> 01:28:57.555]  That was in St.
[01:28:57.555 --> 01:28:58.455]  Moritz, yeah.
[01:28:58.455 --> 01:29:02.276]  And actually, we posted today an old interview from Jim Tucker.
[01:29:02.276 --> 01:29:06.078]  While we were out filming the locals, I saw this guy walking.
[01:29:06.078 --> 01:29:10.479]  I saw the back of him at first, and I'm like, Josh, I think that's Jim Tucker, just kind of making fun.
[01:29:10.479 --> 01:29:12.820]  But he had the hat on, he was kind of walking the same way.
[01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:16.381]  And then we see him sitting in a restaurant a little bit later, I'm like, just shoot some footage of this guy.
[01:29:17.081 --> 01:29:20.302]  Just the spirit of Jim Tucker was alive here in Bilderberg 2015.
[01:29:20.302 --> 01:29:25.524]  I want to kind of put out a little memorial for him so people know where we've come from.
[01:29:25.524 --> 01:29:39.649]  You know people like Jim Tucker were kind of trailblazing this you know decades ago and now we're following in their footsteps and you know just as you've been doing it for years as well but just really taking that spirit of just standing up and saying hey we're gonna expose what you're doing and we're not gonna back down we're not afraid.
[01:29:40.356 --> 01:29:41.016]  That's it.
[01:29:41.016 --> 01:29:42.537]  You have done well, Rob Du.
[01:29:42.537 --> 01:29:47.559]  We're gonna come back and we're gonna play that clip with Josh of them going after your camera.
[01:29:47.559 --> 01:29:49.700]  We'll talk to Josh Owen straight ahead.
[01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:51.721]  Then we'll cover... We're on the march.
[01:29:51.721 --> 01:29:54.243]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.243 --> 01:29:56.924]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.152 --> 01:30:11.857]  Former DARPA Director and now Google Executive Regina Dugan will be attending the secretive 2015 Bilderberg Conference this year in Austria.
[01:30:11.857 --> 01:30:21.061]  Dugan, who is helping to develop and promote the idea of implantable microchips, will be there to head up the discussion on artificial intelligence.
[01:30:21.061 --> 01:30:25.462]  Regina Dugan is also an advocate for ingestible microchips.
[01:30:25.462 --> 01:30:28.804]  That's right, tiny microchips inside little pills.
[01:30:29.324 --> 01:30:35.990]  That users would swallow daily in order to obtain what Dugan describes as superpowers.
[01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:45.717]  By having your entire body act as a biological authentication system for cell phones, cars, door locks, and other devices.
[01:30:45.717 --> 01:30:52.043]  And she is quick to point out that these microchip pills have already been approved by the FDA.
[01:30:52.043 --> 01:30:58.468]  For the complete list of this year's Bilderberg attendees, be sure to check out InfoWars.com.

[01:32:00.444 --> 01:32:01.384]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:32:01.384 --> 01:32:01.944]  Good, brother.
[01:32:01.944 --> 01:32:03.905]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:32:03.905 --> 01:32:05.606]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:32:05.606 --> 01:32:09.647]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:32:09.647 --> 01:32:12.268]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:32:12.268 --> 01:32:14.688]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:32:14.688 --> 01:32:16.729]  Super Mill Vitality was developed.
[01:32:16.989 --> 01:32:22.812]  To activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:32:22.812 --> 01:32:26.114]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:32:26.114 --> 01:32:27.635]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:32:27.635 --> 01:32:30.556]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:32:30.556 --> 01:32:32.337]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:32:32.337 --> 01:32:34.779]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[01:32:35.299 --> 01:32:35.920]  I don't know.
[01:33:14.884 --> 01:33:21.756]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:21.756 --> 01:33:23.379]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:48.214 --> 01:33:49.894]  Made in America!
[01:33:49.894 --> 01:33:56.255]  Rock and Rolla!
[01:33:56.255 --> 01:33:58.096]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:58.096 --> 01:33:58.636]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:58.636 --> 01:34:00.176]  We're here broadcasting worldwide.
[01:34:00.176 --> 01:34:09.098]  I want to go back to our intrepid reporters.
[01:34:09.098 --> 01:34:11.858]  You know, I get irritating.
[01:34:11.858 --> 01:34:15.539]  I irritate the crew sometimes and I can be irritable.
[01:34:17.659 --> 01:34:24.224]  And sometimes I do little snappish things on air, and that's because that's really how I am.
[01:34:24.224 --> 01:34:30.388]  I mean, when I blow up on air, that's real.
[01:34:30.388 --> 01:34:38.053]  And I've been psychoanalyzing this week why I have been in a controlled rage.
[01:34:38.053 --> 01:34:45.579]  And it makes me even sicker that the globalists are now out in the open, they're openly funding Al Qaeda,
[01:34:47.173 --> 01:34:54.416]  It's come out they're funding him to commit all these serious war crimes.
[01:34:54.416 --> 01:34:59.658]  And then I see comments in the news like, well, we've got to do what we've got to do to take out Assad.
[01:34:59.658 --> 01:35:02.739]  Like being Machiavellian is cool.
[01:35:02.739 --> 01:35:08.281]  And to see the weak public and the weak sellout prestitutes, Gerald Salente's term, he's coming up.
[01:35:10.384 --> 01:35:17.046]  To sit back in real politic with the general public and go, yeah, you gotta work on the dark side sometimes.
[01:35:17.046 --> 01:35:20.667]  Yeah, you gotta do really evil things for the greater good.
[01:35:20.667 --> 01:35:26.188]  It makes me want to slap them upside the head.
[01:35:26.188 --> 01:35:27.669]  They haven't studied history.
[01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:29.869]  They don't know how evil works.
[01:35:29.869 --> 01:35:31.010]  They are fools.
[01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:34.071]  They are destroying their prosperity.
[01:35:34.071 --> 01:35:38.852]  And I'll tell you, it's all these soft novices.
[01:35:40.316 --> 01:35:45.637]  Spoiled, entitled babies of every race, color, creed, and religion.
[01:35:45.637 --> 01:35:50.539]  Who feel entitled to everything.
[01:35:50.539 --> 01:35:52.819]  They want to play with evil.
[01:35:52.819 --> 01:35:56.340]  They think it's fun new tricks they've just discovered.
[01:35:56.340 --> 01:35:59.601]  It's not new, it's as old as the hills.
[01:35:59.601 --> 01:36:09.064]  And it leads to... Last century, government killed 262 million people according to the University of Hawaii at Honolulu.
[01:36:11.889 --> 01:36:12.930]  Democide.
[01:36:12.930 --> 01:36:15.753]  Non-military related deaths.
[01:36:15.753 --> 01:36:17.134]  Wars killed probably 500 plus million.
[01:36:17.134 --> 01:36:17.594]  Soldiers.
[01:36:17.594 --> 01:36:19.997]  262 million people.
[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:30.542]  And it was most of the time the same.
[01:36:30.542 --> 01:36:34.885]  Societies that were somewhat industrialized or agrarian, everything was happy.
[01:36:34.885 --> 01:36:35.885]  Everybody's doing good.
[01:36:35.885 --> 01:36:37.626]  They let corrupt people get in.
[01:36:37.626 --> 01:36:38.607]  They want to expand.
[01:36:38.607 --> 01:36:39.548]  They want to raise taxes.
[01:36:39.548 --> 01:36:40.789]  They want to take freedom.
[01:36:40.789 --> 01:36:42.330]  They want to invade a neighbor.
[01:36:42.330 --> 01:36:44.531]  Pretty soon, folks are in forced labor camps.
[01:36:44.531 --> 01:36:47.333]  Black uniforms are everywhere.
[01:36:47.333 --> 01:36:48.954]  Spies are on the street corners.
[01:36:48.954 --> 01:36:50.535]  And the criminals take over.
[01:36:50.535 --> 01:36:52.376]  And then the prosperity goes down the drain.
[01:36:53.857 --> 01:37:04.905]  You've got to sit there scared while a guy in a black uniform is at your house, taking your 18-year-old daughter out on a date, lecturing, you know, to the 50-year-old parents about how the cow ate the cabbage.
[01:37:04.905 --> 01:37:07.567]  I mean, this is what happens in totalitarian places.
[01:37:07.567 --> 01:37:22.357]  All the nobodies, all the scum, all the filth, all the trash, just running everything, having their way with us, piling on greater men, piling on greater women, robbing art, directing the culture.
[01:37:24.358 --> 01:37:29.400]  Excellent movie based on a best-selling non-fiction book, The Lives of Others.
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:48.528]  About the true story of a Stasi sergeant, basically, who's over teams spying on people and watching people commit suicide and stuff.
[01:37:50.711 --> 01:38:08.277]  The playwrights, the artists being dominated by these fascist so-called leftists, and then demanding the starlets have sex with the, you know, communist bureau who's over the media, and just seeing the dehumanization, the opposite of a free market.
[01:38:09.141 --> 01:38:16.424]  Where just because you're Joe Stalin or Adolf Hitler or Mao Zedong, you get to play God.
[01:38:16.424 --> 01:38:17.564]  No, no, no!
[01:38:17.564 --> 01:38:19.785]  You will not take over!
[01:38:23.837 --> 01:38:25.799]  And they couldn't conquer this republic.
[01:38:25.799 --> 01:38:28.341]  They couldn't conquer America even though we had our problems.
[01:38:28.341 --> 01:38:31.723]  We were still hardcore freedom-based and that was spreading worldwide.
[01:38:31.723 --> 01:38:38.148]  So they jacked the water with super doses of hardcore chemical warfare.
[01:38:38.148 --> 01:38:41.011]  And they put in the baking products
[01:38:45.731 --> 01:38:50.253]  The powdered eggs, on average, have 300 parts per million.
[01:38:50.253 --> 01:38:54.155]  I remember I'd go to summer camp sometimes at a Christian camp that had powdered eggs, and I never threw up.
[01:38:54.155 --> 01:38:55.675]  I had an iron stomach.
[01:38:55.675 --> 01:39:00.537]  I still do.
[01:39:00.537 --> 01:39:05.259]  And I remember they'd serve powdered eggs, and I remember telling my dad the next year, I go, I've been there two years, and I don't want to go back to that camp.
[01:39:05.259 --> 01:39:07.700]  I throw up my breakfast, the powdered eggs.
[01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:09.541]  My body was like, what on earth?
[01:39:09.541 --> 01:39:10.822]  But a few times I held them down.
[01:39:12.082 --> 01:39:22.204]  And I remember as a kid, I remember drinking a big glass of tap water and getting a headache and feeling sick.
[01:39:22.204 --> 01:39:24.425]  Didn't even know to ask for bottled or filtered water.
[01:39:24.425 --> 01:39:29.726]  And there I was, having my IQ reduced by at least 10 points.
[01:39:29.726 --> 01:39:30.526]  Look at the Harvard study.
[01:39:30.526 --> 01:39:34.007]  I mean, my dad was top of his class.
[01:39:34.007 --> 01:39:38.568]  He was salutatorian because he played football, too, and sports, and enough time to be valedictorian.
[01:39:38.568 --> 01:39:40.028]  And then they did testing in the state.
[01:39:41.287 --> 01:39:43.148]  160 top smartest overall.
[01:39:43.148 --> 01:39:47.188]  They sent him to UT when he was a junior in high school.
[01:39:47.188 --> 01:39:49.849]  My dad, mathematically in other ways, is way smarter than me.
[01:39:49.849 --> 01:39:51.670]  Because he didn't grow up drinking fluoride, folks.
[01:39:51.670 --> 01:39:56.471]  I am a brain damaged person.
[01:39:56.471 --> 01:39:59.391]  Thanks a lot.
[01:39:59.391 --> 01:40:01.712]  My mom and her parents are just as smart as my dad's family.
[01:40:04.312 --> 01:40:11.755]  I mean, I've already had so much stolen from me and so have you by these people that poisoned our water!
[01:40:11.755 --> 01:40:12.775]  They're evil!
[01:40:12.775 --> 01:40:13.875]  Stop them!
[01:40:13.875 --> 01:40:15.296]  Stop them now!
[01:40:15.296 --> 01:40:20.257]  What is people's problem?
[01:40:20.257 --> 01:40:22.358]  And I just used the water example because it's there.
[01:40:22.358 --> 01:40:23.178]  It's admitted.
[01:40:23.178 --> 01:40:24.139]  They know it's deadly.
[01:40:24.139 --> 01:40:24.979]  It's a sick joke.
[01:40:28.463 --> 01:40:35.768]  1.3 parts per million will lower your IQ by 10 points in the Harvard study after six years of drinking it.
[01:40:35.768 --> 01:40:43.593]  What do you think 300 parts per million on average in a lot of products does?
[01:40:43.593 --> 01:40:47.755]  I'm surprised Americans can even wipe their butts.
[01:40:47.755 --> 01:40:53.058]  So we can't get mad at all these brain damaged zombies because we're all walking around under chemical attack.
[01:40:53.058 --> 01:40:55.320]  We'd all notice a big chemical attack
[01:40:56.530 --> 01:40:58.993]  That was, you know, they spray the town, everybody dies.
[01:40:58.993 --> 01:41:00.655]  Flops around like roaches, dying.
[01:41:00.655 --> 01:41:02.377]  They've been sprayed with raid.
[01:41:02.377 --> 01:41:05.881]  No, they just hit us and we kind of wander off and stumble around and, you know.
[01:41:09.638 --> 01:41:18.320]  And yes, they found that the highest fluoride levels, that's an EPA report, 754 parts per million in powdered eggs.
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:19.320]  On average, it's 300.
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:22.261]  But yeah, see, it's double plus what I said.
[01:41:22.261 --> 01:41:23.822]  Double plus horrible.
[01:41:23.822 --> 01:41:26.842]  That's EPA records, disposition schedule.
[01:41:26.842 --> 01:41:34.584]  This is why the EPA itself, its own scientists, have had a huge rebellion and said, we want it out of the food, we want it out of the water, we want it out of the pesticides.
[01:41:34.584 --> 01:41:35.484]  My God!
[01:41:35.484 --> 01:41:36.285]  And you know why?
[01:41:36.285 --> 01:41:37.765]  Some of these EPA people have testified.
[01:41:38.405 --> 01:41:40.106]  In closed session and it's come out?
[01:41:40.106 --> 01:41:42.147]  They got brain damaged kids, folks!
[01:41:42.147 --> 01:41:44.409]  People don't like having brain damaged kids!
[01:41:44.409 --> 01:41:47.951]  Alright, I'm gonna stop ranting.
[01:41:47.951 --> 01:41:49.131]  I'm gonna go to Josh Owens.
[01:41:49.131 --> 01:41:50.612]  I got a bunch of other news I'm gonna hit.
[01:41:50.612 --> 01:41:54.995]  But, I mean, this is why I blow up, folks.
[01:41:54.995 --> 01:41:58.617]  It's why I feel sorry for anybody that ever punches me or something.
[01:41:58.617 --> 01:42:00.158]  Because I got a lot of rage pent up.
[01:42:01.598 --> 01:42:03.959]  I mean, it's claustrophobic level.
[01:42:03.959 --> 01:42:05.340]  I sit here every day.
[01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:08.121]  Most people want to just go play and party, and I get it.
[01:42:08.121 --> 01:42:10.142]  All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
[01:42:10.142 --> 01:42:11.523]  I can't stop.
[01:42:11.523 --> 01:42:19.947]  All I think about is this, because all I do is just watch them run around like a group of satanic monkeys, sabotaging humanity.
[01:42:19.947 --> 01:42:23.249]  And they call themselves royalty.
[01:42:23.249 --> 01:42:27.771]  Some woman who gets paid by the state and is worth trillions of dollars, and her money's a state secret.
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:37.544]  And they sued the Associated Press and won because the AP videoed them on a yacht in South America and on jet skis in public.
[01:42:37.544 --> 01:42:42.447]  There's not even a presumption of privacy for these people in public.
[01:42:42.447 --> 01:42:43.427]  But they don't care.
[01:42:43.427 --> 01:42:44.668]  They think they're God.
[01:42:44.668 --> 01:42:45.388]  Well, guess what?
[01:42:45.388 --> 01:42:51.591]  You're not God, whore!
[01:42:51.591 --> 01:42:54.893]  And by whore, I mean drunk on the blood of the innocents is what you are.
[01:42:54.893 --> 01:42:55.333]  All of you.
[01:42:55.333 --> 01:42:56.574]  I'm sick of you.
[01:42:58.610 --> 01:43:02.472]  All you could do to dominate us was dumb us down from birth, poison our food and water.
[01:43:02.472 --> 01:43:04.913]  Well, guess what?
[01:43:04.913 --> 01:43:06.374]  We know about it.
[01:43:06.374 --> 01:43:09.296]  Even in a stunned state, once you're conscious, we're gonna defeat you.
[01:43:11.323 --> 01:43:12.443]  They want us to be like them, too.
[01:43:12.443 --> 01:43:16.264]  Their kids are all so inbred and so screwed up and committing suicide and on drugs.
[01:43:16.264 --> 01:43:21.626]  I mean, these globals will have like six, seven, eight kids trying to get one just to replace them.
[01:43:21.626 --> 01:43:24.327]  They can't even get a good kid out of five or six kids.
[01:43:24.327 --> 01:43:25.667]  You people are cursed!
[01:43:25.667 --> 01:43:27.508]  And you think your curse is on us?
[01:43:27.508 --> 01:43:30.289]  It's going to have any effect with your chemicals and biologicals?
[01:43:30.289 --> 01:43:35.430]  God's going to curse you with stuff that no bunker is going to allow you escape!
[01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:39.011]  Excuse me, let's go to Josh Owens covering Bilderberg 2015 in Austria.
[01:43:39.011 --> 01:43:40.792]  Josh Owens, go ahead.
[01:43:42.465 --> 01:43:44.565]  Hey Alex, Joshua Owens at Forwards.com.
[01:43:44.565 --> 01:43:54.067]  What you were talking about earlier with the cop trying to take my camera, it's on the video on the Alex Jones Channel called the Police Trying to Confiscate a Reporter's Camera.
[01:43:54.067 --> 01:44:05.569]  And when I was there, it was almost a little blip in what happened, but when I went back and re-watched the video, I realized he actually lunged for my camera and I know he hit my hand, but I was in the moment of everything that was going on.
[01:44:05.569 --> 01:44:08.090]  Look at the arrogance in his eyes and in the still image.
[01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:09.450]  I mean, what a joke!
[01:44:10.916 --> 01:44:17.079]  Well yeah, in that moment he was just trying to intimidate us because as soon as I pulled the camera away, he walked off.
[01:44:17.079 --> 01:44:21.741]  He walked off in the back and hid behind this little corner wall and kept saying, we did not call you.
[01:44:21.741 --> 01:44:22.421]  We did not call you.
[01:44:22.421 --> 01:44:24.642]  He was very upset that you... Exactly!
[01:44:24.642 --> 01:44:27.864]  We talk to you, you don't talk to... Hillary, you don't talk to her?
[01:44:27.864 --> 01:44:28.744]  You don't look her in the eye?
[01:44:28.744 --> 01:44:30.305]  That's Bilderberg meeting rules.
[01:44:30.305 --> 01:44:33.927]  You don't look at any of their godly faces.
[01:44:33.927 --> 01:44:34.387]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:44:35.492 --> 01:44:35.952]  No, exactly.
[01:44:35.952 --> 01:44:43.358]  And I think just speaking from being in Copenhagen last year, I think that might be one of the reasons that they've gone back into hiding in such secluded areas.
[01:44:43.358 --> 01:44:45.580]  Because last year, we were right beside the hotel.
[01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:47.081]  I mean, we could smell the food they were eating.
[01:44:47.081 --> 01:44:48.102]  We were watching them eat.
[01:44:48.102 --> 01:44:49.863]  We were watching them smoke cigars.
[01:44:49.863 --> 01:44:54.006]  And now they've set up a perimeter to where, you know, we might see them.
[01:44:54.006 --> 01:44:54.867]  I'm not sure.
[01:44:54.867 --> 01:44:55.748]  But I think that's a big part of it.
[01:44:55.748 --> 01:44:58.690]  I'm telling you, they're going to have world leaders there at a secret summit or something.
[01:44:58.690 --> 01:44:59.691]  Something big's going on.
[01:45:02.546 --> 01:45:10.278]  Yeah, well, I mean, I think the point, well, last night I was talking to a friend and he said, you know, the reason that the cops freak out on you guys is because you're filming them.
[01:45:10.278 --> 01:45:12.562]  Most reporters don't go through there and film the checkpoints.
[01:45:12.562 --> 01:45:14.966]  They just go through them, get through it.
[01:45:15.493 --> 01:45:16.793]  And everything's fine.
[01:45:16.793 --> 01:45:19.274]  And I was like, yeah, but don't you realize that's the point?
[01:45:19.274 --> 01:45:27.155]  That's the whole reason that we're here is to keep these big, monolithic creatures from growing and spreading.
[01:45:27.155 --> 01:45:30.016]  If someone's not covering it, it just gets worse.
[01:45:30.016 --> 01:45:33.557]  It festers like a sore and then it's out of control.
[01:45:33.557 --> 01:45:38.318]  So obviously they don't freak out on other reporters because they're not filming them.
[01:45:38.318 --> 01:45:41.138]  The ones that do film them, they feel threatened.
[01:45:41.138 --> 01:45:42.899]  Well, that shows the mindset.
[01:45:42.899 --> 01:45:43.739]  Who are you talking to?
[01:45:43.739 --> 01:45:44.279]  Charlie Skelton?
[01:45:45.785 --> 01:45:48.828]  No, no, this was just one of my friends back home.
[01:45:48.828 --> 01:45:51.570]  I want to interview Charlie about what he went through.
[01:45:51.570 --> 01:45:55.773]  He's a really nice, friendly guy, and he gets harassed everywhere he goes, and he stands up to it.
[01:45:55.773 --> 01:46:07.463]  But then you run into other reporters who say, oh, you just ought to not get in Bilderberg's way, as if we're the ones imposing trying to cover this criminal organization, as if we're troublemakers.
[01:46:07.463 --> 01:46:08.004]  But exactly.
[01:46:09.042 --> 01:46:14.249]  People who are selfish minded always think, well why do you go to Bilderberg if you don't want to have this happen?
[01:46:14.249 --> 01:46:18.494]  It's this idea of just submit.
[01:46:18.494 --> 01:46:23.140]  No, we know, or people say, haha the cops rousted you, you're idiots.
[01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:25.062]  No, we know they're going to do that.
[01:46:25.062 --> 01:46:26.865]  We're there to show it's happening.
[01:46:28.749 --> 01:46:35.254]  I mean, it'd be like in World War II, flying a bomber over Germany, and then people write letters back going, uh-huh, I saw newsreels of you getting shot at.
[01:46:35.254 --> 01:46:36.034]  You're an idiot.
[01:46:36.034 --> 01:46:42.399]  As if you didn't know you were going to get shot at, you're there to draw fire, to show what's going on.
[01:46:42.399 --> 01:46:44.520]  Everything is military on the planet.
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:45.421]  Business, life.
[01:46:46.475 --> 01:46:55.659]  Absolutely, and people act like it's outrageous or absurd what we do when we cover the police being authoritarian, but you know the big secret is
[01:47:16.772 --> 01:47:20.373]  Everyone right now listening to this, you can pull your phone out and hold it like this.
[01:47:20.373 --> 01:47:21.654]  And that's about the extent of it.
[01:47:21.654 --> 01:47:23.655]  It's not hard to do.
[01:47:23.655 --> 01:47:24.776]  It's not difficult.
[01:47:24.776 --> 01:47:30.139]  People either say that it's so heroic to do it or that it's idiotic to do it and it's absurd.
[01:47:30.139 --> 01:47:37.963]  And the fact of the matter is that we've been harassed from the second we got here when we started ascending the mountain.
[01:47:38.564 --> 01:47:40.486]  A nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves, Thomas Jefferson.
[01:47:40.486 --> 01:47:41.106]  What doesn't the public
[01:48:05.208 --> 01:48:05.848]  Yeah.
[01:48:05.848 --> 01:48:07.189]  Don't act like prisoners.
[01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:08.490]  Don't act like perps.
[01:48:08.490 --> 01:48:14.093]  The public in general acts like criminals in front of the police and all scared and the cops act accordingly.
[01:48:14.093 --> 01:48:19.075]  I've noticed if you just smile at the cops, wave at them, come over and talk to them, most of the time they'll be eaten out of your hand.
[01:48:19.075 --> 01:48:23.338]  They're so used to the public hating them, they now hate the public.
[01:48:23.338 --> 01:48:25.479]  That's what George Soros and the globalists have set up.
[01:48:25.979 --> 01:48:26.779]  They brag about it.
[01:48:26.779 --> 01:48:35.683]  They are setting up where we're all fighting with each other locally, instead of taking our counties and cities back, putting police forces in like we want, and taking our world back.
[01:48:35.683 --> 01:48:36.844]  That's how we're going to do it.
[01:48:36.844 --> 01:48:37.884]  We're the winners.
[01:48:37.884 --> 01:48:39.205]  We're the good guys.
[01:48:39.205 --> 01:48:40.626]  We're out promoting freedom.
[01:48:41.346 --> 01:48:42.766]  And we're not ashamed of it.
[01:48:42.766 --> 01:48:43.927]  That's the key.
[01:48:43.927 --> 01:48:45.727]  Stop acting like you're ashamed of this.
[01:48:45.727 --> 01:48:47.308]  Be bold, folks.
[01:48:47.308 --> 01:48:49.528]  Be bold in the face of this scum.
[01:48:49.528 --> 01:48:52.049]  The only hope we've got is going in hard against these people.
[01:48:52.049 --> 01:48:52.409]  110%.
[01:48:52.409 --> 01:48:56.770]  And let me tell you, every time we take action, we have victory.
[01:48:56.770 --> 01:49:02.052]  That's what's so frustrating is people don't know how powerful good men are and how powerful good women are.
[01:49:05.555 --> 01:49:05.995]  Absolutely.
[01:49:05.995 --> 01:49:09.458]  And the fact of the matter is, is that at the end of the day, you're going to wish you had done it.
[01:49:09.458 --> 01:49:12.441]  You're going to wish that you had stood up before it got to the point where you couldn't.
[01:49:12.441 --> 01:49:17.786]  Because history proves that when it gets to that point, you're going to be begging that you could get that time back.
[01:49:17.786 --> 01:49:20.808]  And I just don't think people realize it because people aren't paying attention.
[01:49:20.808 --> 01:49:21.609]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:49:21.609 --> 01:49:24.291]  If we're going to go to break, I'm going to come back and hit Economic News and shift gears.
[01:49:24.291 --> 01:49:25.392]  I'm Gerald Cilente joining us.
[01:49:25.392 --> 01:49:26.373]  Anything else that needs to be added?
[01:49:26.373 --> 01:49:27.114]  What are you planning next?
[01:49:29.196 --> 01:49:31.857]  Tomorrow we have a lot of stuff planned.
[01:49:31.857 --> 01:49:40.741]  The meeting hasn't started yet, so tomorrow the meeting starts and hopefully we'll get to see the face of evil up close.
[01:49:40.741 --> 01:49:43.483]  Alright, well you guys are doing a fantastic job.
[01:49:43.483 --> 01:49:44.143]  God bless you.
[01:49:44.143 --> 01:49:45.483]  Folks are praying for you.
[01:49:45.483 --> 01:49:49.405]  Josh Owens, Paul Watson, and of course Rob New reporting from Austria.
[01:49:49.405 --> 01:49:50.686]  Thank you.
[01:49:50.686 --> 01:49:50.906]  Thank you.
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:56.384]  And we'll continue to watch and monitor their Twitter feeds at RealAlexJones.
[01:49:56.384 --> 01:50:04.751]  We'll continue to monitor everything that's happening and if something big happens, we'll go live on the Ustream, post the video to Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:05.925 --> 01:50:10.208]  Sometimes during Bilderberg, InfoWars gets attacked and taken down, even though that's very sophisticated to do.
[01:50:10.208 --> 01:50:13.271]  They have to actually get into the control servers to do it.
[01:50:13.271 --> 01:50:17.074]  And we've got some of the best companies and individuals and hackers out there keeping the sites up.
[01:50:17.074 --> 01:50:18.755]  The attacks are pretty much continual.
[01:50:18.755 --> 01:50:22.338]  But if InfoWars goes down, then there's things like Prison Planet.
[01:50:22.338 --> 01:50:25.540]  That's why we have other websites as backups.
[01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:29.743]  Because really all InfoWars and Prison Planet are is launch points.
[01:50:29.743 --> 01:50:34.347]  So third-party groups like Facebook, Twitter, and others can't censor us when we launch.
[01:50:35.563 --> 01:50:38.725]  That's something everybody else should do, is spread the word about this broadcast.
[01:50:38.725 --> 01:50:44.829]  Also, shoot your own videos, or take other videos, edit them together with info you think is important, and post it.
[01:50:44.829 --> 01:50:51.593]  We need more people firing, firing, firing, firing on the globalists in the info war, and just never stop.
[01:50:51.593 --> 01:50:54.815]  And we're going to go up over the top on these people, and we're going to look down, they're going to be defeated.
[01:50:54.815 --> 01:50:59.118]  They're going to be Nuremberg trials, and they're going to get taken up to the gallows.

[01:51:01.343 --> 01:51:05.449]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:05.449 --> 01:51:08.653]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.

[01:53:19.361 --> 01:53:19.561]  I think?
[01:53:37.875 --> 01:53:38.135]  I think so.
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:07.842]  Don't call your name out my window, I'm leaving.
[01:54:07.842 --> 01:54:12.886]  I won't even turn my head.
[01:54:12.886 --> 01:54:18.910]  Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving.
[01:54:18.910 --> 01:54:20.992]  I won't even turn my head.
[01:54:20.992 --> 01:54:23.794]  Don't send your kin, folks.
[01:54:23.794 --> 01:54:28.618]  Don't send your kin, folks, to give me no talking.
[01:54:28.618 --> 01:54:29.818]  I'll be gone.
[01:54:29.818 --> 01:54:31.600]  I'll be gone, like I said.
[01:54:34.244 --> 01:54:35.805]  Just lay there in your bed.
[01:54:35.805 --> 01:54:39.388]  Remember listening to this when I was a kid right along with my dad?
[01:54:49.795 --> 01:54:52.196]  My mom's great, so they never had that kind of relationship.
[01:54:52.196 --> 01:54:53.496]  Let me tell you.
[01:54:53.496 --> 01:54:56.738]  You grow up, and you learn these songs are based on reality.
[01:54:56.738 --> 01:55:01.639]  Don't send your kinfolks around to give you no talking to.
[01:55:01.639 --> 01:55:06.421]  Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut till I'm gone.
[01:55:06.421 --> 01:55:07.021]  Oh, man.
[01:55:07.021 --> 01:55:11.863]  When the song goes on, I'll be out there untangling my mind.
[01:55:11.863 --> 01:55:15.365]  And, you know, the allegory is the Bilderberg Group.
[01:55:15.365 --> 01:55:18.686]  This evil succubus
[01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:24.522]  Attached to humanity that is just involved in so much horrible stuff.
[01:55:24.522 --> 01:55:28.685]  I mean, just Henry Kissinger.
[01:55:28.685 --> 01:55:34.027]  Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote in one of his books, I forget which one, I read like five books he wrote.
[01:55:34.027 --> 01:55:39.050]  You can pull the quotes up online where he said, yeah, I'm very proud of the fact that, of what the Khmer Rouge did.
[01:55:39.050 --> 01:55:42.572]  And, you know, the best part was, is I manipulated them into killing everybody.
[01:55:42.572 --> 01:55:44.253]  I didn't kill them myself, so I'm innocent.
[01:55:44.926 --> 01:55:52.650]  It's like this weird, sick... Of course, he's saying he's behind it, but then bragging to the elite how he did it and protected himself.
[01:55:52.650 --> 01:56:05.917]  They're all about not getting the blame, not... That's why they have boards and globalist groups and international laws and no one knows exactly who did it or how it happened, so no one gets the blame.
[01:56:05.917 --> 01:56:09.319]  We're not fighting Napoleon or Hitler.
[01:56:09.319 --> 01:56:09.959]  We can see them.
[01:56:12.534 --> 01:56:20.577]  We're just fighting big swarms of corporate con artists who are run by eugenicists at the top.
[01:56:20.577 --> 01:56:32.661]  I'm just going to go over this with Gerald Cilente, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the West Coast of North America to be slammed by 2016 with 80% as much Fukushima radiation as Japan.
[01:56:32.661 --> 01:56:38.103]  Clearing your browser history can be deemed destruction of justice in the US.
[01:56:38.103 --> 01:56:38.463]  It's just...
[01:56:39.793 --> 01:56:42.935]  I think what's really getting to me is, like I said earlier, it's out in the open now.
[01:56:42.935 --> 01:56:47.719]  I mean, I knew this stuff before, you knew this stuff, but now they're titrating the dose.
[01:56:47.719 --> 01:56:58.126]  That's where he gets my poison in small amounts and build it up until they develop an immunity or resistance to it, become tolerant.
[01:56:58.126 --> 01:57:05.271]  And they've just built the poison level up so high, where now, I mean, they could start barbecuing children on the White House lawn.
[01:57:05.271 --> 01:57:07.653]  I mean, maybe that would wake people up.
[01:57:07.653 --> 01:57:09.034]  Like the New York Times a few years ago.
[01:57:12.128 --> 01:57:19.733]  Paul Walsh is like, look at this, they admit in the New York Times the UN rounds up the African villagers and kills them to create a carbon sink so they can build a factory nearby.
[01:57:19.733 --> 01:57:29.880]  This is good news, it's coming out, and I said, and Paul's as smart as I am, or smarter, but I said, Paul, they're putting it in the paper to condition you to accept it.
[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:34.763]  That, oh yeah, the UN just lines up people and murders them, but they're liberals, so it's okay.
[01:57:39.179 --> 01:57:45.965]  Briefly, I mentioned last hour, we're funded by the high quality products at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:57:45.965 --> 01:57:54.754]  And we have the ProPure G2 Filter Pitcher System, the entire system for 20% off.
[01:57:54.754 --> 01:57:57.637]  It's normally like $69.
[01:57:57.637 --> 01:57:58.457]  It's $55.95 right now.
[01:57:58.457 --> 01:58:03.082]  That is the biggest true percentage off anything we've ever offered.
[01:58:04.141 --> 01:58:07.784]  We just keep lowering prices, trailblazing.
[01:58:07.784 --> 01:58:11.508]  We had to go to the manufacturer and get signed off because I have a contract.
[01:58:11.508 --> 01:58:13.149]  I can't go below a certain amount.
[01:58:13.149 --> 01:58:14.530]  We have the lowest prices already.
[01:58:14.530 --> 01:58:19.995]  So when you tell like we're Walmart, we raise it 30% one week and then lower it 20% the next week and tell you it's a sale.
[01:58:19.995 --> 01:58:21.477]  When we got a sale, it's a sale.
[01:58:22.546 --> 01:58:30.989]  And your purchase, this is a great way to get a high-quality filter that cuts off fluoride, glyphosate, reduces or removes thousands of different chemicals that are in different water supplies.
[01:58:30.989 --> 01:58:32.669]  You're insane if you're not filtering.
[01:58:32.669 --> 01:58:34.530]  This is the time to get the Pitcher.
[01:58:34.530 --> 01:58:35.350]  It's portable.
[01:58:35.350 --> 01:58:37.391]  I think it's the best bang for your buck out there.

[02:00:06.918 --> 02:00:08.238]  Big Brother.
[02:00:08.238 --> 02:00:09.999]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:09.999 --> 02:00:11.759]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:11.759 --> 02:00:13.340]  You want answers?
[02:00:13.340 --> 02:00:14.100]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.864 --> 02:00:19.066]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:19.066 --> 02:00:27.169]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.169 --> 02:00:43.937]  The alleged pedo-bear, Dennis Hasterts, out of the headlines now, but you notice they got him for withdrawing his own after-tax money to pay off one of his alleged
[02:00:44.895 --> 02:00:50.658]  Molestation victims.
[02:00:50.658 --> 02:00:57.081]  Now, you look at those laws, they can be applied towards scumbags.
[02:00:57.081 --> 02:01:01.543]  But, they're generally applied against innocent people, and that's come out in the news.
[02:01:01.543 --> 02:01:14.490]  They just had hearings three months ago in Congress about the IRS targeting hundreds of thousands of innocent people a year, just grabbing their bank accounts, you name it, if they made small withdrawals or lots of small deposits, even though they could say each deposit was from the cash of the day.
[02:01:17.162 --> 02:01:19.043]  From the restaurant.
[02:01:19.043 --> 02:01:25.528]  Now there's no law there, there's just a regulation they can interpret.
[02:01:25.528 --> 02:01:36.737]  And we know the Boston bombing is as phony as a leprechaun from Pluto riding a rainbow pony unicorn.
[02:01:36.737 --> 02:01:40.540]  Drawn by 14 Santa Clauses.
[02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:43.062]  On a sleigh of unattainium.
[02:01:43.062 --> 02:01:45.664]  With a beautiful Hillary Clinton jumping over the moon.
[02:01:48.353 --> 02:01:50.675]  Playing tiddlywinks.
[02:01:50.675 --> 02:01:53.957]  It's just as nonsensical, it's pure bull.
[02:01:53.957 --> 02:01:57.740]  Well, look at this story out of CBS News that I've been mentioning.
[02:01:57.740 --> 02:02:03.904]  Clearing your browser history can be deemed obstruction of justice in the U.S.
[02:02:03.904 --> 02:02:12.270]  Next week, a 24-year-old man who knew Boston bombing, Marathon Bombers, is scheduled to appear in U.S.
[02:02:12.270 --> 02:02:16.152]  federal court for sentencing on obstruction of justice charges related to 2013 attacks.
[02:02:19.212 --> 02:02:23.674]  And they're arguing it's because he erased his browser history.
[02:02:23.674 --> 02:02:28.616]  I mean, I erase my browser history every time I go buy something.
[02:02:28.616 --> 02:02:30.977]  Which I order groceries online sometimes, clothes.
[02:02:30.977 --> 02:02:32.157]  I don't like shopping, obviously.
[02:02:32.157 --> 02:02:35.559]  I take my daughter shopping sometimes.
[02:02:35.559 --> 02:02:41.001]  Go get my son a new tennis racket or whatever, but fishing poles or shotgun shells.
[02:02:41.001 --> 02:02:43.602]  But I tend to buy stuff online now, as most people do.
[02:02:45.629 --> 02:02:51.253]  And are they going to come bust me and argue I erased my browser, I'm covering something up?
[02:02:51.253 --> 02:02:53.654]  And I can't pronounce this guy's name.
[02:02:53.654 --> 02:03:02.580]  Karulzahan Matodova, a former taxi driver, did not participate in any of or have any knowledge of the bombings according to U.S.
[02:03:02.580 --> 02:03:03.401]  authorities.
[02:03:03.401 --> 02:03:12.547]  What could land him in 20 years in prison, plus he has since been in his arrest, are the charges that he deleted video files from his computer and cleared his browser history in the days following the attacks.
[02:03:16.229 --> 02:03:30.972]  A grand jury indictment issued May 29th, 2014, states that he deleted a large amount of information from his Google Chrome internet cache following the bombing, including references to the video of the suspect bombers, which they went and got from Google anyways.
[02:03:30.972 --> 02:03:39.333]  Two of the photographs of the bombers released approximately at the same time, and a photograph of Officer Sean Collier, who had been allegedly killed.
[02:03:39.333 --> 02:03:42.554]  I mean, this is just sick how they're going after all these innocent people,
[02:03:43.533 --> 02:03:47.374]  To shut them up because they all know it's phony.
[02:03:47.374 --> 02:03:48.435]  I mean, guys, let me tell you.
[02:03:48.435 --> 02:03:51.256]  The older brother was in the CIA.
[02:03:51.256 --> 02:03:56.117]  He was at Georgetown in CIA-funded projects openly.
[02:03:56.117 --> 02:04:02.840]  Connected to radicalizing the Jihad in the Caucasus.
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:04.980]  And the Russians blew his cover two years before.
[02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:06.981]  The FBI got caught lying about that.
[02:04:08.663 --> 02:04:18.009]  They've killed his friends, executed him, shot him in public, bus stations, in their houses, they put handcuffs on you and shoot you in the back of the head, and then nobody gets in trouble.
[02:04:18.009 --> 02:04:20.591]  I mean, that's dangerous, folks.
[02:04:20.591 --> 02:04:22.692]  They can do that to anybody.
[02:04:22.692 --> 02:04:35.300]  Now, either he went over there as a double agent to create Al Qaeda groups or to spy on them, and then he came back and attacked and was a triple agent, or what's more likely is he thought it was part of a drill and they set him up.
[02:04:36.594 --> 02:04:37.635]  It's just wrong.
[02:04:37.635 --> 02:04:39.057]  He was a playboy.
[02:04:39.057 --> 02:04:42.060]  He was into boxing, MMA, into girls.
[02:04:42.060 --> 02:04:44.102]  He wasn't a devout Muslim.
[02:04:44.102 --> 02:04:45.323]  They set him up.
[02:04:45.323 --> 02:04:47.465]  And the media says I'm this evil demon for saying it.
[02:04:47.465 --> 02:04:50.689]  The government runs Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[02:04:50.689 --> 02:04:54.813]  Fox News, when you attack me, I mean, I'm telling the truth here.
[02:04:54.813 --> 02:04:59.297]  And I don't know what happened at the Boston bombing, but what we're told ain't it, okay?
[02:04:59.297 --> 02:04:59.598]  Ain't it.
[02:05:01.164 --> 02:05:02.266]  It's that time again.
[02:05:02.266 --> 02:05:06.253]  A private party with some of the most powerful people on earth.
[02:05:06.253 --> 02:05:10.099]  Privacy guaranteed by thousands of police, paid for by the public.
[02:05:14.378 --> 02:05:29.243]  Besides Kissinger, regular attendee David Petraeus will be there with his get-out-of-jail card, courtesy of pals like Tony Blair, who put in a good word for him when he leaked reams of classified documents, as long as he doesn't reveal any Bilderberg secrets.
[02:05:29.243 --> 02:05:42.708]  And of course, there's the heads of banks, who've recently been caught rigging interest rates with LIBOR, rigging currency exchanges, commodity rates, pretty much rigging every market, and getting caught money laundering, but just getting off with a slap on the wrist.
[02:05:42.708 --> 02:05:43.588]  Where are the police?
[02:05:44.068 --> 02:05:48.030]  If you have a party at your home and there comes a burglar, it's also your private home.
[02:05:48.030 --> 02:05:48.530]  Sure.
[02:05:48.530 --> 02:05:50.711]  And we save it.
[02:05:50.711 --> 02:05:52.752]  Somebody needs to keep an eye on these crooks.
[02:05:52.752 --> 02:05:54.834]  Tune in to Infowars.com.
[02:05:54.834 --> 02:05:55.534]  I'm David Knight.

[02:07:25.085 --> 02:07:31.030]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.

[02:07:35.995 --> 02:07:39.578]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:07:39.918 --> 02:07:46.520]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:07:46.520 --> 02:07:51.681]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[02:08:03.765 --> 02:08:10.858]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones!
[02:08:29.895 --> 02:08:37.861]  This next line, I think, goes for any nuclear war between the U.S., Russia, or China.
[02:08:37.861 --> 02:08:40.903]  You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too!
[02:08:40.903 --> 02:08:44.006]  You'll find your musket, but I'll run you through!
[02:08:44.006 --> 02:08:45.947]  So when you're waiting for the next attack...
[02:08:59.415 --> 02:09:04.620]  As we rush into certain death.
[02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:08.503]  Well, Gerald Salente, three, four years ago, said World War III could be coming.
[02:09:08.503 --> 02:09:10.224]  Nobody else was really saying that at the time.
[02:09:10.224 --> 02:09:12.326]  I remember his Trans Journal.
[02:09:12.326 --> 02:09:15.849]  He's so good at it, he'll probably, uh, without me even giving him time to do it...
[02:09:17.125 --> 02:09:26.300]  Pull up the quotes, but I remember in his Trends journals three, four years ago, he kept harping that when the economy starts to go down, they take us to war.
[02:09:26.300 --> 02:09:30.566]  And this time, China, maybe even Russia or vice versa.
[02:09:31.826 --> 02:09:35.768]  And I'm not saying China and Russia don't have their own corrupt problems.
[02:09:35.768 --> 02:09:38.310]  It's the exact same type of oligarchies.
[02:09:38.310 --> 02:09:40.971]  But the West is pushing it all.
[02:09:40.971 --> 02:09:43.673]  And the very same West is screwing us over.
[02:09:43.673 --> 02:09:48.135]  At least a long time ago, corrupt empires took care of their own people, generally.
[02:09:48.135 --> 02:09:50.077]  And the spoils came back to Rome.
[02:09:50.077 --> 02:09:52.318]  The spoils came back to London.
[02:09:52.318 --> 02:09:59.482]  The spoils came back to Usterbeck.
[02:09:59.482 --> 02:10:01.123]  But they don't even come back now.
[02:10:02.418 --> 02:10:08.868]  The globalists sell us out to other dictators, but then also try to keep them in check with military forces.
[02:10:10.373 --> 02:10:13.995]  So we got Bilderberg 2015 with the TPP in the background.
[02:10:13.995 --> 02:10:20.319]  We've got global government being exposed, these corporate combines, these illegal lobbying groups coming out.
[02:10:20.319 --> 02:10:26.842]  We've got the stock markets in trouble, the bond markets teetering, but they just keep pumping up the bubble bigger.
[02:10:26.842 --> 02:10:31.905]  There is so much to get into today with Gerald Cilente of TrendsResearch.com.
[02:10:33.166 --> 02:10:43.051]  Gerald Salente is an American trends forecaster, publisher of the Trends Journal, business consultant and author, and makes predictions about the global financial markets and other events of historical importance.
[02:10:43.051 --> 02:10:47.874]  Salente has described himself as a political atheist and a citizen of the world.
[02:10:47.874 --> 02:10:56.958]  He's appeared on everything from the Today Show to Good Morning America to Oprah Winfrey, CBS, NBC Nightly News, Russia Today, Alex Jones Show, you name it, TrendsResearch.com.
[02:10:56.958 --> 02:10:57.819]  And boy, you read his
[02:10:59.634 --> 02:11:03.397]  Spring issues, but not a while, and it's just spot-on.
[02:11:03.397 --> 02:11:05.379]  Summer one coming up soon.
[02:11:05.379 --> 02:11:06.840]  Gerald Solente again joins us.
[02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:24.154]  We have defense intelligence documents coming out, and there's all this new news here, but it's just such a big deal that our government admits in Pentagon reports that our government set up al-Qaeda and ISIS in Egypt and in Syria, and now they want to quote open bases back up to fight them.
[02:11:25.714 --> 02:11:27.955]  But you watch, it'll be to just keep them in this new enclave.
[02:11:27.955 --> 02:11:30.936]  They're splitting Iraq up right now.
[02:11:30.936 --> 02:11:32.637]  They don't run ISIS or Al-Qaeda.
[02:11:32.637 --> 02:11:34.618]  They funded them, they turned them loose.
[02:11:34.618 --> 02:11:38.600]  Now they're going to keep them in that area.
[02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:40.420]  Keep them in that zone.
[02:11:40.420 --> 02:11:45.883]  That's Saudi Arabia's reward for being behind 9-11 with the criminals in our government.
[02:11:45.883 --> 02:11:49.144]  Now the media frames that as I'm saying there's not radical Islamists.
[02:11:49.144 --> 02:11:50.605]  There absolutely are.
[02:11:50.605 --> 02:11:53.246]  And whereas Al-Qaeda, the old Al-Qaeda was mainly synthetic.
[02:11:55.114 --> 02:12:09.605]  This new ISIS, they allowed them to recruit for years worldwide, is a bunch of idiot bots recruited by globalist intelligence agencies to be run by their psych warfare controllers who pose as EMOBs.
[02:12:09.605 --> 02:12:12.507]  And they have Saudi Arabian, Turkish and NATO money.
[02:12:13.643 --> 02:12:19.928]  And it just came out two weeks ago that the jihadis are putting out videos threatening info wars, official al-Qaeda, ISIS.
[02:12:19.928 --> 02:12:20.768]  I'm proud of that.
[02:12:20.768 --> 02:12:22.229]  I'm very proud of that.
[02:12:22.229 --> 02:12:24.331]  Joe Biggs is very proud of that.
[02:12:24.331 --> 02:12:29.935]  And they admit we're hurting their recruiting, and they're telling their people, do not listen to the American pig.
[02:12:29.935 --> 02:12:33.838]  We are not to run by them and jihad for us, yes.
[02:12:33.838 --> 02:12:41.004]  Because you see, the truth is hitting them hard, so these teenagers and others understand that they're setting up the Middle East to be destroyed.
[02:12:41.744 --> 02:12:47.049]  They're setting it up for a clash of civilizations, so I've kind of set the table for Gerald Salente.
[02:12:47.049 --> 02:13:04.845]  I'll be throwing a lot of wild cards at him today, but Gerald, you're probably scrambling around with your stacks of articles and documents, but I remember you obsessively writing, actually five, six years ago, but the last three intensifying, about going to war with Russia mainly, and the preparations for that and why they want war.
[02:13:06.192 --> 02:13:10.276]  To basically be the smoke screen for an economic implosion so they don't get blamed.
[02:13:10.276 --> 02:13:13.759]  Now that it's all happening, I don't hear you talk about it that much.
[02:13:13.759 --> 02:13:17.562]  So break down why you saw that coming and where we're going.
[02:13:17.562 --> 02:13:24.488]  Well, talking about it, we just sent out a Trends this week, just today.
[02:13:24.488 --> 02:13:27.671]  It went out and it's about the Middle East.
[02:13:27.671 --> 02:13:29.212]  It's exploded.
[02:13:29.212 --> 02:13:30.193]  The world is at war.
[02:13:32.682 --> 02:13:36.743]  And you briefly mentioned it when you talked about Saudi Arabia.
[02:13:36.743 --> 02:13:41.325]  You want to talk about some radicals, how about those Wahhabis, huh?
[02:13:41.325 --> 02:13:42.546]  Aren't they wonderful?
[02:13:42.546 --> 02:13:57.931]  Hey, how come you don't hear all these people like Samantha Powers and Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice and Condoleezza Rice and all of these women that claim that we should be in Afghanistan because of the way they
[02:13:58.709 --> 02:14:04.053]  Treat women so terribly, but they have a lot more when it comes to Saudi Arabia.
[02:14:04.053 --> 02:14:11.758]  I mean, the women aren't even allowed to drive a car, can't leave the country without permission from their husband, and on and on and on.
[02:14:11.758 --> 02:14:21.444]  They have no rights at all, but they're quiet about that because it goes back to what you're saying about supporting these radical fundamentalists.
[02:14:21.444 --> 02:14:23.586]  Because among the most radical are
[02:14:24.042 --> 02:14:25.264]  The Saudis!
[02:14:25.264 --> 02:14:31.351]  Hey Alex, you know how they love to show those pictures of ISIS beheading a guy every now and then?
[02:14:31.351 --> 02:14:31.732]  Yes!
[02:14:31.732 --> 02:14:34.215]  What, the Saudis up to now already?
[02:14:34.215 --> 02:14:39.542]  It's only a half a year and they broke last year's record in beheadings?
[02:14:39.542 --> 02:14:40.423]  They're up to about 88 now!
[02:14:41.364 --> 02:14:46.807]  And it's what they're beheading people for, talking bad about the Prophet Muhammad or whatever.
[02:14:46.807 --> 02:14:49.509]  And look, if that's their country, a hellhole, they can do it.
[02:14:49.509 --> 02:14:56.873]  I don't want it exported here, and the left gets up there, Gerald, as you know, and says, we have to get rid of free speech because it might offend somebody.
[02:14:56.873 --> 02:14:58.253]  That's the whole point.
[02:14:58.253 --> 02:15:00.115]  I'm not out insulting Muhammad.
[02:15:00.115 --> 02:15:02.076]  I'm not out trying to troll the Muslims.
[02:15:02.076 --> 02:15:06.838]  But at the same time, if somebody, if some preacher wants to do it, it's their right.
[02:15:06.838 --> 02:15:09.860]  Because the minute they take their right, they take Gerald Salente's right.
[02:15:10.916 --> 02:15:18.122]  Yeah, again, going back to this though with the Saudis, you know, they're behind a lot of this destabilization.
[02:15:18.122 --> 02:15:18.602]  Yes.
[02:15:18.602 --> 02:15:25.768]  They're the ones, the Arab Little League, with the others that started the war in Libya.
[02:15:25.768 --> 02:15:28.110]  They're the ones that are overthrowing Assad.
[02:15:28.110 --> 02:15:30.912]  You mentioned Turkey and now Erdogan.
[02:15:31.428 --> 02:15:32.729]  The Saudis are slaughtering
[02:15:58.863 --> 02:16:04.024]  Yemenis on a daily basis bombing the place.
[02:16:04.024 --> 02:16:12.306]  It's the poorest country in the Middle East being bombed by one of the richest countries.
[02:16:12.306 --> 02:16:22.588]  And one of the princes gave him a hundred and something Bentleys to the pilots calling him brave heroes bombing towns with no with no anti-aircraft guns from 30,000 feet.
[02:16:22.588 --> 02:16:26.429]  I mean that'd be like me stepping on a frog and giving myself a medal.
[02:16:27.581 --> 02:16:35.627]  And me being the United States feeding you with everything that you need to crush them.
[02:16:35.627 --> 02:16:47.055]  So we have our Assistant Secretary of State over in Riyadh bragging that they're setting up coordination centers and cells
[02:16:47.642 --> 02:17:03.805]  To do reconnaissance, to do intelligence, to do refueling, and to assist them with the military-industrial complex to supply Saudi Arabia with everything it needs to slaughter these people.
[02:17:03.805 --> 02:17:06.346]  Now, this is why it's so big.
[02:17:06.346 --> 02:17:15.528]  When do you remember in our lifetime that the Saudis have launched a war against another country?
[02:17:15.528 --> 02:17:16.108]  Never.
[02:17:16.108 --> 02:17:16.348]  Never.
[02:17:17.426 --> 02:17:22.870]  So what they're doing is they're one of the largest arms buyers in the world.
[02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:25.152]  And now they're putting those arms to work.
[02:17:25.152 --> 02:17:25.512]  That's right.
[02:17:25.512 --> 02:17:26.313]  Oh, I thought of that.
[02:17:26.313 --> 02:17:31.937]  They've been stockpiling and are estimated to be, what, fifth or sixth in the world for arms stockpiling.
[02:17:31.937 --> 02:17:33.078]  I'd forgotten that.
[02:17:33.078 --> 02:17:34.880]  And I guess now they're expending all those.
[02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:38.702]  I mean, they have a hell horde of weapons, don't they?
[02:17:38.702 --> 02:17:39.663]  Exactly.
[02:17:39.663 --> 02:17:41.625]  So now, if you're a
[02:17:42.279 --> 02:17:46.340]  A Yemeni, and your family's just been wiped out.
[02:17:46.340 --> 02:17:53.401]  Oh, and by the way, you have about 4 million of you guys working in the Saudi oil fields.
[02:17:53.401 --> 02:17:56.182]  You think you're going to seek revenge?
[02:17:56.182 --> 02:18:01.103]  So what we're saying is, get ready for the counterattacks.
[02:18:01.103 --> 02:18:05.944]  The prostitutes, the media whores, they'll call it terrorism.
[02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:09.011]  It's getting even.
[02:18:09.011 --> 02:18:09.311]  That's right.
[02:18:09.311 --> 02:18:12.372]  They're going to call the Shiites responding to be exterminated.
[02:18:12.372 --> 02:18:18.874]  And I'm not trying to lionize the Shiites, but compared to the Wahhabis, they really are the underdog and are always being attacked.
[02:18:18.874 --> 02:18:21.976]  And now when they strike back, they're going to be called terrorists is what you're saying.
[02:18:21.976 --> 02:18:22.676]  Exactly.
[02:18:22.676 --> 02:18:29.779]  Because what they're going to start doing is they're going to start launching attacks on Saudi oil fields.
[02:18:29.779 --> 02:18:30.599]  Guaranteed.
[02:18:31.144 --> 02:18:33.366]  It's already beginning to happen.
[02:18:33.366 --> 02:18:35.889]  It's not making the American news.
[02:18:35.889 --> 02:18:38.091]  Number two, or the Western news.
[02:18:38.091 --> 02:18:42.195]  Number two, they're going to attack the, quote, royal family.
[02:18:42.195 --> 02:18:45.198]  I love how they give these names like, what are we, six years old?
[02:18:45.198 --> 02:18:46.619]  A royal family.
[02:18:46.619 --> 02:18:48.201]  You know what happened, don't you, Alex?
[02:18:49.136 --> 02:18:54.803]  A princess kissed a frog and the frog became a king and they're royal.
[02:18:54.803 --> 02:18:56.545]  Who's making this crap up?
[02:18:56.545 --> 02:19:09.200]  It's a dictatorship that was put in place following the breakup of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, as you well know, and your listeners do, with the Sykes-Picot Plan.
[02:19:09.620 --> 02:19:11.522]  There was no Saudi Arabia.
[02:19:11.522 --> 02:19:13.224]  There was no Iraq.
[02:19:13.224 --> 02:19:20.551]  They made these countries up and put dictators in to run the joints and now it's beginning to collapse.
[02:19:20.551 --> 02:19:23.093]  Why this is so important in Yemen?
[02:19:23.093 --> 02:19:27.578]  When the retaliation happens against Saudi Arabia,
[02:19:28.027 --> 02:19:30.268]  It's going to start spreading.
[02:19:30.268 --> 02:19:32.209]  It's going to go into Bahrain.
[02:19:32.209 --> 02:19:33.909]  It's going to go into Qatar.
[02:19:33.909 --> 02:19:37.611]  It's going to go into the United Arab Emirates.
[02:19:37.611 --> 02:19:41.252]  The Middle East is already in flames.
[02:19:41.252 --> 02:19:44.753]  Oh, and our Commander-in-Chief.
[02:19:44.753 --> 02:19:49.095]  Obama should be brought up on charges of treason.
[02:19:49.764 --> 02:19:59.113]  He has lied about everything that he said when he was campaigning as the candidate Obama.
[02:19:59.113 --> 02:20:11.706]  But you remember that, you know, this was the guy that was going to get rid of the Patriot Act, close Guantanamo, and most recently our liar-in-chief,
[02:20:12.409 --> 02:20:25.384]  Last September, when we were gonna save them Yazidis on the mountain, and I'm not gonna put no boots back on the ground, the boots are flying back into Iraq!
[02:20:26.352 --> 02:20:27.934]  One lie after another.
[02:20:27.934 --> 02:20:28.974]  And you predicted that.
[02:20:28.974 --> 02:20:30.296]  You said we'd put troops back in.
[02:20:30.296 --> 02:20:31.036]  Here's the headline today.
[02:20:31.036 --> 02:20:31.637]  The U.S.
[02:20:31.637 --> 02:20:34.719]  prepares plans for more troops, new bases, and Iraq officials.
[02:20:34.719 --> 02:20:45.288]  And watch, they're going to split the country in three parts and claim they've made a peace deal with the new caliphate down the road, which is what the West planned all along.
[02:20:45.288 --> 02:20:47.650]  And again, it's out of control.
[02:20:48.391 --> 02:20:51.392]  It has been for centuries.
[02:20:51.392 --> 02:20:57.375]  This whole Prophet Muhammad thing with the Shia and the Sunnis is going on since he died.
[02:20:57.375 --> 02:21:05.959]  And for those who don't know, the Shiites say that you've got to have a genetic line to Muhammad to be basically a priest.
[02:21:05.959 --> 02:21:08.720]  And the others say, no, anybody can be.
[02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:10.441]  And of course, that groups the majority, 80 percent.
[02:21:11.866 --> 02:21:19.678]  About 19% are Shiite and another 1% are kind of these subgroups, Alawites, Zohar, Astro-Muslim subgroups.
[02:21:19.678 --> 02:21:24.565]  But they hate each other just absolutely more than some of the radicals hate the West.
[02:21:24.565 --> 02:21:25.686]  And I see the West
[02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:31.084]  Trying to start a Shiite-Sunni civil war.
[02:21:31.084 --> 02:21:32.686]  Looks like they're doing a pretty good job.
[02:21:32.686 --> 02:21:34.528]  That's exactly it.
[02:21:34.528 --> 02:21:38.512]  They're creating destabilization in the entire area.
[02:21:38.512 --> 02:21:41.174]  They're pitting one against the other.
[02:21:41.174 --> 02:21:43.236]  And the people are the losers.
[02:21:43.236 --> 02:21:45.058]  You look what's going on in Syria.
[02:21:45.058 --> 02:21:46.820]  Syria wasn't bothering anybody.
[02:21:47.233 --> 02:21:51.876]  And you remember, oh this is what I love too, with the cover of the Trends Journal.
[02:21:51.876 --> 02:21:54.758]  We call it the Presidential Reality Show.
[02:21:54.758 --> 02:21:57.640]  Liars, crooks, freaks and fools.
[02:21:57.640 --> 02:22:00.122]  You look at Hillary Clinton now.
[02:22:00.122 --> 02:22:04.945]  This is the woman responsible for the overthrow of Gaddafi.
[02:22:04.945 --> 02:22:09.368]  And you remember that famous clip of her on CBS News.
[02:22:09.967 --> 02:22:13.509]  Asking, how did she feel when they found out he was dead?
[02:22:13.509 --> 02:22:18.491]  And here she is, we came, we saw, he died.
[02:22:18.491 --> 02:22:19.812]  He, he, he.
[02:22:19.812 --> 02:22:29.177]  Anyway, going back to the fallacy of this whole campaign and what they're doing, now she's playing an Obama.
[02:22:29.177 --> 02:22:31.518]  She's playing Miss Progressive.
[02:22:32.173 --> 02:22:35.157]  She's playing peace and love.
[02:22:35.157 --> 02:22:41.104]  She's playing we're going to help the little peoples on and on and on.
[02:22:41.104 --> 02:22:48.773]  In the meantime, and as Obama did as well, they keep pushing for more war.
[02:22:48.773 --> 02:22:51.376]  And I'm sick of this term that they use.
[02:22:51.920 --> 02:22:54.962]  Oh no, these aren't combat troops on the ground.
[02:22:54.962 --> 02:22:56.944]  These are advisors.
[02:22:56.944 --> 02:22:58.365]  What does everybody have?
[02:22:58.365 --> 02:23:00.567]  Attention Deficit Disorder?
[02:23:00.567 --> 02:23:06.011]  That's what they call them in Vietnam.
[02:23:06.011 --> 02:23:08.633]  What are other big areas you're looking at right now?
[02:23:08.633 --> 02:23:10.454]  Other developments?
[02:23:10.454 --> 02:23:13.236]  The big one is what's going on in China.
[02:23:13.236 --> 02:23:17.580]  You look at the oil imports that are going on there, they're down over 15%.
[02:23:19.571 --> 02:23:24.574]  You look at their export and import trade, down both of them.
[02:23:24.574 --> 02:23:26.935]  China is in a bubble.
[02:23:26.935 --> 02:23:28.796]  But here's what's going on.
[02:23:28.796 --> 02:23:32.238]  You talked about the volatility in the bond markets.
[02:23:32.238 --> 02:23:34.619]  There's volatility in the oil markets.
[02:23:34.619 --> 02:23:42.243]  You're seeing swings on the equity markets in the Shanghai Index, whether it's the DAX in Europe.
[02:23:42.243 --> 02:23:43.624]  You're seeing 3% and 5% swings daily.
[02:23:46.605 --> 02:23:49.048]  There's total volatility.
[02:23:49.048 --> 02:23:57.117]  The only way this market has been propped up is by this cheap money, and they have no way out.
[02:23:57.117 --> 02:23:59.779]  You know, we had a conference here last week.
[02:23:59.779 --> 02:24:07.508]  One of the guest speakers was Nomi Prince, who, as you well know, was the author of All the President's Bankers.
[02:24:07.508 --> 02:24:08.589]  As it would happen,
[02:24:09.298 --> 02:24:24.246]  Just two days before she came here to Colonial Kingston, she was a keynote speaker at the Federal Reserve meeting with the World Bank and the IMF and the Federal Reserve.
[02:24:24.952 --> 02:24:32.234]  And here she is on a tape and they'll be made available at the conference saying they don't know what they're talking about.
[02:24:32.234 --> 02:24:36.456]  Well, Gerald, I'd love to air some of that and put a plug at the end to get the full interview.
[02:24:36.456 --> 02:24:43.378]  But for folks that don't know, Nomi Prins was a managing director at Goldman Sachs.
[02:24:43.378 --> 02:24:46.339]  She worked under the head of Goldman Sachs.
[02:24:46.339 --> 02:24:51.481]  And back in 2002 or whatever, couldn't be part of it anymore because of what she saw coming.
[02:24:51.481 --> 02:24:52.321]  And that's huge.
[02:24:53.462 --> 02:25:06.636]  That she was a keynote speaker at a Federal Reserve major event, because we even have major Federal Reserve subchairmen in Dallas and Kansas City, sounding like Gerald Cilente, sounding like others.
[02:25:06.636 --> 02:25:09.639]  So it really shows people in the system are worried.
[02:25:09.639 --> 02:25:13.062]  That is huge that they had her address the Federal Reserve.
[02:25:14.016 --> 02:25:15.997]  And she said what she wanted.
[02:25:15.997 --> 02:25:18.999]  She said, you know who I am and I'm going to say what I feel like.
[02:25:18.999 --> 02:25:27.885]  She said what happened was that the reason it went over so well was that the opening address just before her was from a cardinal.
[02:25:27.885 --> 02:25:33.109]  And the cardinal said that the bank should be doing more to help the people and help the poor.
[02:25:33.109 --> 02:25:36.992]  So he kind of set the framework for her to come out blasting away.
[02:25:36.992 --> 02:25:38.673]  And what a dynamo she is.
[02:25:39.286 --> 02:25:45.308]  And then we had a Q&A afterwards and her and I both went on and talked about the same issues.
[02:25:45.308 --> 02:25:52.511]  But the bottom line of all of this is, is that at the top, they don't know what they're doing.
[02:25:52.511 --> 02:25:54.492]  They have no idea.
[02:25:55.112 --> 02:25:56.632]  They're guessing at us.
[02:25:56.632 --> 02:25:59.173]  There's never been such a thing as quantitative easing.
[02:25:59.173 --> 02:25:59.533]  That's right.
[02:25:59.533 --> 02:26:03.553]  We're in a total la-la land of experimentation.
[02:26:03.553 --> 02:26:05.154]  And how long can it keep going?
[02:26:05.154 --> 02:26:10.355]  I mean, we know, as you predicted, the real collapse globally for real people started a few years ago.
[02:26:10.355 --> 02:26:12.635]  We had, you know, 0.2 growth.
[02:26:12.635 --> 02:26:13.735]  We know that's Cook numbers.
[02:26:13.735 --> 02:26:16.336]  Ron Paul agreed that it's probably 3% negative.
[02:26:16.336 --> 02:26:17.596]  That's a depression.
[02:26:17.596 --> 02:26:22.517]  But they paper over it with this fake service economy and all these baubles.
[02:26:22.517 --> 02:26:24.057]  But even that's starting to implode.
[02:26:24.906 --> 02:26:29.709]  Well, again, look at the numbers coming out now in the housing market.
[02:26:29.709 --> 02:26:33.452]  After all of this cheap money, it's still no great deal out there.
[02:26:33.452 --> 02:26:36.774]  It's, you know, they're building half of what they did during the boom.
[02:26:36.774 --> 02:26:39.136]  They talk about the rebirth of manufacturing.
[02:26:39.136 --> 02:26:43.018]  Again, another Washington White House line.
[02:26:43.018 --> 02:26:43.879]  You know, you have since 2007
[02:26:45.640 --> 02:26:51.544]  You know, manufacturing's down over 3%, and some 3 million jobs in manufacturing have been lost.
[02:26:51.544 --> 02:26:52.805]  And where are they made up?
[02:26:52.805 --> 02:26:57.328]  Oh, they're made up in healthcare, ambulatory services, jobs that pay nothing.
[02:26:57.328 --> 02:26:58.628]  Here's the facts.
[02:26:58.628 --> 02:27:09.735]  You go from when the crash happened to now, 95% of all the wealth gained during that period in the United States went to 1%.
[02:27:09.735 --> 02:27:11.977]  I'm not making that number up.
[02:27:11.977 --> 02:27:13.018]  It's a fact.
[02:27:13.018 --> 02:27:15.099]  While the income of the average person
[02:27:15.979 --> 02:27:20.601]  The median household income is even now below 1999 levels.
[02:27:20.601 --> 02:27:22.321]  There is no recovery.
[02:27:22.321 --> 02:27:24.022]  It's only enriching the rich.
[02:27:24.022 --> 02:27:27.383]  So when is it going to explode or implode?
[02:27:27.383 --> 02:27:29.543]  I would have thought three years ago.
[02:27:29.543 --> 02:27:34.265]  We had forecast they were going to raise interest rates in March of 2014.
[02:27:36.365 --> 02:27:48.112]  Who in their right mind would have ever believed that they would keep these interest rates, zero percent interest rates, going on for 90 months?
[02:27:48.112 --> 02:27:53.555]  And you saw what happened back in Switzerland and in Germany just a couple of months ago.
[02:27:53.555 --> 02:28:04.441]  They're selling 10-year bonds that pay negative interest rates, which means you buy the bond and get less money back under the big lie of deflation.
[02:28:05.101 --> 02:28:06.542]  10 years later.
[02:28:06.542 --> 02:28:22.351]  So this is all a game that, and here's what we're saying, and that's what this week's Trends is about, that the Middle East could be the kind of catalyst that blows these markets to pieces.
[02:28:22.351 --> 02:28:25.253]  And that's the outside geopolitical event
[02:28:26.019 --> 02:28:37.812]  Everybody should be watching closely what's going on in Yemen because the prostitutes aren't reporting it and the United States is a part of it.
[02:28:37.812 --> 02:28:38.933]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:28:41.189 --> 02:28:45.290]  We've talked about this forever, but now it's in the Guardian, the New York Times, everywhere.
[02:28:45.290 --> 02:28:47.690]  The elites are buying underground bunkers, safe houses.
[02:28:47.690 --> 02:28:49.111]  They're moving to New Zealand.
[02:28:49.111 --> 02:28:53.552]  I know a lot of Hollywood folks six, seven years ago were telling me, you know, we think the U.S.
[02:28:53.552 --> 02:28:54.252]  is going to collapse.
[02:28:54.252 --> 02:28:55.592]  That's the inside word.
[02:28:55.592 --> 02:28:58.192]  Big producers, billionaires moving.
[02:28:58.192 --> 02:29:01.753]  Israel, all their billionaires have left and moved out.
[02:29:01.753 --> 02:29:03.734]  What do the elite know the public doesn't know?
[02:29:03.734 --> 02:29:04.574]  Why are they so scared?
[02:29:04.574 --> 02:29:10.955]  You know, there was in Bloomberg yesterday, there was a fellow from South Africa.
[02:29:11.647 --> 02:29:15.832]  I believe he's the head of Cartier.
[02:29:15.832 --> 02:29:17.654]  Jason, I think, Rapport.
[02:29:17.654 --> 02:29:21.158]  He came out and said he's worried about total social unrest because of inequality.
[02:29:21.158 --> 02:29:21.919]  Yeah, Johan.
[02:29:21.919 --> 02:29:22.780]  That was his first thing.
[02:29:22.780 --> 02:29:24.081]  Exactly.
[02:29:24.081 --> 02:29:25.763]  And this is a guy's say.
[02:29:25.763 --> 02:29:27.946]  And he's in South Africa, so he's really feeling it.
[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:29.941]  And that's what's going to happen.
[02:29:29.941 --> 02:29:31.081]  You know what I say.
[02:29:31.081 --> 02:29:34.123]  When people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose.
[02:29:34.123 --> 02:29:39.025]  Let's talk about that when we come back and ways to protect ourselves and other important news you're looking into.
[02:29:39.025 --> 02:29:40.606]  Gerald Salente is our guest.
[02:29:40.606 --> 02:29:49.391]  Find his excellent website, TrendsResearch.com, and subscribe to his amazing quarterly publication and other goodies at that website in support.
[02:29:49.391 --> 02:29:50.692]  Hardcore liberty-based trends media.
[02:29:50.692 --> 02:29:51.772]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.772 --> 02:29:54.293]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.293 --> 02:29:56.975]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.061 --> 02:30:06.324]  House Speaker Boehner says fast-track legislation will likely be voted on by the House this weekend.
[02:30:06.324 --> 02:30:13.288]  The only snag, they say, is working out how they're going to get welfare checks to Americans who are going to lose their jobs.
[02:30:13.288 --> 02:30:15.589]  But it's not just jobs and wealth that we're losing.
[02:30:16.289 --> 02:30:24.477]  Senator Jeff Sessions, one of the few people in either House of Congress to actually bother to read the secret treaty, is very disturbed by what he's seeing.
[02:30:24.477 --> 02:30:26.960]  As he points out, it is a treaty.
[02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:33.827]  With fast track, Congress is giving up the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds vote to pass a treaty.
[02:30:33.827 --> 02:30:39.532]  But the biggest secret of this secret agreement is that it creates a commission with global governance powers.
[02:30:39.532 --> 02:30:40.093]  This commission
[02:30:40.593 --> 02:30:45.316]  We'll be able to modify the treaty without any further input from any country.
[02:30:45.316 --> 02:30:56.701]  As Senator Sessions says, Congress would be pre-clearing a political and economic union before a word of that arrangement has been made available to a single private citizen.
[02:30:56.701 --> 02:30:59.023]  For more information, go to Infowars.com.
[02:30:59.023 --> 02:30:59.603]  I'm David Knight.
[02:31:01.010 --> 02:31:02.270]  Another major health threat.
[02:31:02.270 --> 02:31:07.252]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:31:07.252 --> 02:31:09.913]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:31:09.913 --> 02:31:16.955]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:31:16.955 --> 02:31:19.976]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:31:19.976 --> 02:31:22.997]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:31:22.997 --> 02:31:24.937]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:31:24.937 --> 02:31:27.778]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:31:27.858 --> 02:31:33.581]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:31:33.581 --> 02:31:37.083]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:31:37.083 --> 02:31:40.184]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:31:40.184 --> 02:31:47.488]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[02:31:47.488 --> 02:31:50.710]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[02:32:00.816 --> 02:32:17.472]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[02:32:17.472 --> 02:32:20.955]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[02:32:21.315 --> 02:32:25.380]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[02:32:25.380 --> 02:32:26.922]  Hdfirearms.com.
[02:32:26.922 --> 02:32:30.225]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[02:32:30.225 --> 02:32:35.351]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[02:32:35.351 --> 02:32:36.052]  It's always about
[02:32:36.172 --> 02:32:36.712]  I think so.
[02:33:10.643 --> 02:33:23.146]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:23.146 --> 02:33:30.228]  Imagine a house of cards, but unlike other house of cards you may have seen before, a giant house of cards.
[02:33:31.613 --> 02:33:34.035]  Built on quicksand.
[02:33:34.035 --> 02:33:37.277]  Towering thousands of feet in the air.
[02:33:37.277 --> 02:33:40.780]  And a storm is blowing in, and you can already feel the wind.
[02:33:40.780 --> 02:33:42.781]  You see the cards beginning to move.
[02:33:42.781 --> 02:33:46.684]  Some of them are falling, but the whole structure hasn't come down yet.
[02:33:46.684 --> 02:33:50.347]  And we just stand here watching it.
[02:33:50.347 --> 02:33:59.574]  With the rigged stock market, and the rigged interest rates, and the rigged currency markets, all of it now, AP, Reuters, Bloomberg, admit it!
[02:34:00.580 --> 02:34:01.941]  And nobody gets in trouble.
[02:34:01.941 --> 02:34:06.123]  They pay fines that are less than 1% of the profit they made off the fraud.
[02:34:06.123 --> 02:34:13.967]  It comes out in the news that major banks own the aircraft shipping drugs in, and flying torture people out, and little kids.
[02:34:13.967 --> 02:34:18.410]  I mean, you start to study who runs things, and it's just like, really?
[02:34:18.410 --> 02:34:27.735]  It's beyond any Hollywood movie, it's beyond... And it's just the scale of it.
[02:34:28.902 --> 02:34:30.103]  Gerald Solente is our guest.
[02:34:30.103 --> 02:34:33.765]  I want to talk to him about all these revelations coming out.
[02:34:33.765 --> 02:34:40.950]  I mean, from the government running radical Islam and funding it, to the stock market, everything being rigged, to NSA spying on us.
[02:34:40.950 --> 02:34:50.295]  I mean, really, everything I've been talking about for 20 years, everything Gerald's been talking about for 35 years, it's just all come out now.
[02:34:50.295 --> 02:34:52.977]  So where do we go from here?
[02:34:52.977 --> 02:34:54.518]  I always thought you exposed it.
[02:34:54.518 --> 02:34:55.339]  That would do something.
[02:34:55.339 --> 02:34:56.339]  Instead, there's a doubling down.
[02:34:56.339 --> 02:34:57.180]  We'll talk to him in a moment.
[02:34:58.302 --> 02:34:59.822]  We have different specials every week.
[02:34:59.822 --> 02:35:03.603]  We have probably 600, 700 items at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:35:03.603 --> 02:35:06.864]  High quality non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[02:35:06.864 --> 02:35:07.784]  Very low prices.
[02:35:07.784 --> 02:35:09.104]  Very high quality.
[02:35:09.104 --> 02:35:12.625]  Super high quality water filters, books, film, nutraceuticals.
[02:35:12.625 --> 02:35:14.605]  And that's how we fund this independent media operation.
[02:35:14.605 --> 02:35:16.266]  Not with taxpayer money.
[02:35:16.266 --> 02:35:16.986]  But with your support.
[02:35:16.986 --> 02:35:17.986]  We want to thank you.
[02:35:17.986 --> 02:35:18.846]  Want to salute you.
[02:35:18.846 --> 02:35:20.307]  PrisonPlanet.tv memberships.
[02:35:20.307 --> 02:35:21.007]  You name it.
[02:35:21.007 --> 02:35:22.027]  And supporting our sponsors.
[02:35:24.980 --> 02:35:27.681]  But we have a special this week that's particularly good.
[02:35:27.681 --> 02:35:29.461]  It's going to run through next week because I'm launching it late.
[02:35:29.461 --> 02:35:32.262]  We're launching it today.
[02:35:32.262 --> 02:35:33.342]  Planned to run this months ago.
[02:35:33.342 --> 02:35:36.143]  Had to get permission from the manufacturer, Pro-1 G2.
[02:35:36.143 --> 02:35:42.185]  We have the whole family of the filters at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:35:42.185 --> 02:35:49.007]  We have the lowest price anywhere, $69.95 normally for the pitcher that doesn't have any of the MBTA in it.
[02:35:50.766 --> 02:35:59.408]  BPA-free, 3.5 liter overall capacity, 1.75 liter filtered water capacity, ideal for refrigerator storage.
[02:35:59.408 --> 02:36:04.790]  Features new design, easy to remove lid, simple setup, and use no unsettling filter.
[02:36:04.790 --> 02:36:09.031]  Hanging in the water storage area includes one filter element.
[02:36:09.031 --> 02:36:16.172]  It's great for travel, great for camping, great for your car, great for work, great for home, great for the refrigerator.
[02:36:16.172 --> 02:36:17.773]  I mean, and at this price,
[02:36:18.832 --> 02:36:22.356]  Other leading competitors are like $60, $70 and it's a charcoal filter.
[02:36:22.356 --> 02:36:24.299]  That's not what this does.
[02:36:24.299 --> 02:36:28.143]  This isn't just some element that takes some of the bad taste out and reduces a little bit of stuff.
[02:36:28.143 --> 02:36:32.829]  This cuts out hundreds of different things or reduces it down to like 99%.
[02:36:32.829 --> 02:36:34.191]  We have this plus.
[02:36:34.191 --> 02:36:37.735]  We have all the different studies and stuff at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:36:38.922 --> 02:36:44.588]  This is the best individual deal we've ever offered on any of these units.
[02:36:44.588 --> 02:36:50.073]  Sure, we've had free shipping and things like that before, and 10% off is proverbial with the promo code WATER.
[02:36:50.073 --> 02:36:59.782]  This is just on this unit, the Pro Pure Pitcher, and it's a great idea that Weldon and Tim Fergé had.
[02:37:02.079 --> 02:37:04.080]  They approached and we were able to get this deal.
[02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:07.503]  Pro-Pure Pitcher available at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:11.733 --> 02:37:17.635]  And I mean, I'd buy these for preparedness, I'd buy them for storage, but it does thousands of gallons for the filter has to be replaced.
[02:37:17.635 --> 02:37:24.316]  It does have a replaceable filter you can get as well, but quite frankly, you know, the filters are like $25 to $30, because they're expensive to make.
[02:37:24.316 --> 02:37:30.038]  So you're getting a super good deal, because it is filters included, $55 instead of $69.
[02:37:30.038 --> 02:37:34.779]  20% off info or store.com, or you can simply call 888-253-3139.
[02:37:34.779 --> 02:37:35.259]  And it is!
[02:37:39.051 --> 02:37:53.955]  Your financial support deciding to shop with the good guys, deciding to spend your hard-earned money with Infowars.com that's funding our reporters covering Bilderberg, that's funding the studios and the satellite uplinks and the radio shows and the news websites that are having a big effect.
[02:37:53.955 --> 02:37:55.196]  You're not going to find a place
[02:37:55.836 --> 02:38:01.020]  With bigger bang for the buck, actually affecting the destiny of the planet than InfoWars.
[02:38:01.020 --> 02:38:04.083]  And the array of amazing minds and guests we bring you.
[02:38:04.083 --> 02:38:08.166]  And one of those chief amongst them is Gerald Cilente, TrendsResearch.com.
[02:38:08.166 --> 02:38:13.931]  You need to support the good guy so he can continue and expand and do more, which you've been doing.
[02:38:13.931 --> 02:38:21.497]  Become a member, get his free trends updates or sign up, get the quarterly and get more of their exclusive material that it costs money to put out.
[02:38:21.937 --> 02:38:26.521]  And get the Trends Journal quarterly sent to you at TrendsResearch.com.
[02:38:26.521 --> 02:38:31.465]  Okay, going back to Gerald Cilente, who again is doubling down on America.
[02:38:31.465 --> 02:38:36.689]  He went and bought land there in New York where the country started, Colonial Kingston.
[02:38:36.689 --> 02:38:37.730]  He's having conferences.
[02:38:37.730 --> 02:38:38.670]  He's making the news.
[02:38:38.670 --> 02:38:40.191]  He's doing international media.
[02:38:40.191 --> 02:38:41.252]  He's doing domestic media.
[02:38:41.252 --> 02:38:42.894]  He's reaching millions every week.
[02:38:42.894 --> 02:38:45.656]  He's doing his own daily show, video blog.
[02:38:46.136 --> 02:38:47.016]  He's taking action.
[02:38:47.016 --> 02:38:47.917]  Will he save the world?
[02:38:47.917 --> 02:38:48.517]  No.
[02:38:48.517 --> 02:38:51.018]  But together, we can bring back a renaissance.
[02:38:51.018 --> 02:38:52.398]  And that's what he's been talking about.
[02:38:52.398 --> 02:38:55.219]  The globalists admit they uglied up architecture.
[02:38:55.219 --> 02:38:57.079]  They uglied up clothes.
[02:38:57.079 --> 02:38:59.500]  So we would lose respect for ourselves.
[02:38:59.500 --> 02:39:02.041]  They had the CIA fund ugly art.
[02:39:02.041 --> 02:39:03.501]  They've done it scientifically.
[02:39:03.501 --> 02:39:05.502]  It's declassified.
[02:39:05.502 --> 02:39:08.363]  Are they going to be successful suppressing humanity, Gerald Salente?
[02:39:09.278 --> 02:39:21.700]  No, and with every, you know, there was a great quote from Rand Paul right after he announced that he was running for president and he was being interviewed on NBC.
[02:39:21.700 --> 02:39:26.161]  And the host asked him if he always wanted to run for president.
[02:39:26.161 --> 02:39:29.102]  He said, no, you know, he said it wasn't always on his mind.
[02:39:29.102 --> 02:39:34.202]  He said, but, you know, I hear from the guys that are running out there that you hear from.
[02:39:34.202 --> 02:39:37.243]  They wanted to be president, run for president since
[02:39:38.049 --> 02:39:40.631]  They were in the eighth grade.
[02:39:40.631 --> 02:39:42.592]  And that's what you have.
[02:39:42.592 --> 02:39:52.398]  As I say, the people that are running the show... You've said it a hundred times on this show, thousands on your own, they want to be the people running things since they were kids.
[02:39:52.398 --> 02:39:53.379]  That's not who you want.
[02:39:53.379 --> 02:39:57.662]  You want a George Washington or an Eisenhower that doesn't want the job.
[02:39:57.662 --> 02:40:06.988]  And just as you couldn't stand these guys that wanted to be... and women... that wanted to be class president and head the student council in high school and college,
[02:40:07.540 --> 02:40:09.441]  You can't stand them now.
[02:40:09.441 --> 02:40:14.963]  And what I'm saying is, those are the people running the show.
[02:40:14.963 --> 02:40:18.164]  Why is everybody afraid of them?
[02:40:18.164 --> 02:40:20.345]  Of course it could change.
[02:40:20.345 --> 02:40:27.468]  There's nothing in the way to stop it other than the will and what they've done.
[02:40:27.468 --> 02:40:35.671]  And you've been talking about it because when you put it all in context, it's a neo-feudal society.
[02:40:36.348 --> 02:40:43.532]  We have a political elite, an economically privileged, and we the little people.
[02:40:43.532 --> 02:40:45.653]  You mentioned it before.
[02:40:45.653 --> 02:40:48.994]  All of the forex rigging, it's a fact.
[02:40:48.994 --> 02:40:52.716]  All of the live war rate rigging, you know, the interest rates, it's a fact.
[02:40:52.716 --> 02:40:54.117]  Gold, silver, it's all come out.
[02:40:54.117 --> 02:40:55.477]  Everything's rigged.
[02:40:55.477 --> 02:40:56.298]  It's rigged.
[02:40:56.298 --> 02:41:02.821]  All of the, quote, missteps and misleading of the peanuts that they paid
[02:41:03.217 --> 02:41:06.901]  Just like Corzine grabbed your bank account and didn't get in trouble.
[02:41:22.350 --> 02:41:28.312]  And the laws for the nobility are different than the peasants.
[02:41:28.312 --> 02:41:30.993]  And that's what's happened in the country.
[02:41:30.993 --> 02:41:36.835]  Anybody that has to deal with the government at any level, look what they do.
[02:41:36.835 --> 02:41:44.197]  You know, you asked me one time, it was on the last show, have I ever been harassed, you know, been treated unfairly by the police?
[02:41:44.197 --> 02:41:44.837]  I forgot.
[02:41:45.310 --> 02:41:48.252]  I wrote a whole story in the Trends Journal.
[02:41:48.252 --> 02:41:50.873]  I called it to pee or not to pee.
[02:41:50.873 --> 02:41:56.816]  I pulled off on a country road in the middle of nowhere in upstate New York.
[02:41:56.816 --> 02:41:58.117]  Yeah, where are you supposed to?
[02:41:58.117 --> 02:42:01.679]  I mean, growing up in Texas, you see everybody pulled over peeing in a bush.
[02:42:01.679 --> 02:42:04.640]  I was going into the woods.
[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:05.741]  I had a convertible.
[02:42:05.741 --> 02:42:06.661]  My top was down.
[02:42:06.661 --> 02:42:08.062]  It was 10 o'clock at night.
[02:42:08.965 --> 02:42:22.158]  I wrote the story and I even sent the same letter that I wrote in the Trends Journal to the court up here in New York, where this guy started harassing me, this state trooper.
[02:42:22.158 --> 02:42:25.001]  Who am I looking for in the woods?
[02:42:25.001 --> 02:42:29.425]  And he would not let me go to the bathroom and followed me for 45 minutes.
[02:42:31.636 --> 02:42:33.097]  This guy harassed me.
[02:42:33.097 --> 02:42:36.138]  He wanted to start a confrontation.
[02:42:36.138 --> 02:42:40.880]  So in a neo-feudal society, don't go over that yellow line.
[02:42:40.880 --> 02:42:44.001]  Your signal light wasn't on when you made a turn.
[02:42:44.001 --> 02:42:50.644]  You had your brakes on when another car was coming at you, but still trillions of dollars.
[02:42:51.204 --> 02:42:59.170]  Ruin the lives of tens of millions of people by foreclosing on their homes, robbing them of everything you've got.
[02:42:59.170 --> 02:43:00.791]  And you know what you get, Alex?
[02:43:00.791 --> 02:43:03.212]  You get dinner at the White House.
[02:43:03.212 --> 02:43:04.653]  That's what you get.
[02:43:04.653 --> 02:43:07.675]  You don't do anything wrong.
[02:43:07.675 --> 02:43:08.976]  Stay in line.
[02:43:08.976 --> 02:43:14.340]  We're going to prosecute to the letter of the law because we're a neo-feudal society.
[02:43:14.340 --> 02:43:16.261]  And what do the prostitutes do?
[02:43:16.261 --> 02:43:18.703]  Those disgusting human beings.
[02:43:18.703 --> 02:43:20.104]  Those media whores.
[02:43:20.524 --> 02:43:22.145]  I'll tell you what they do.
[02:43:22.145 --> 02:43:25.368]  Hey, you see what happened with FIFRA?
[02:43:25.368 --> 02:43:27.910]  I'm saying to myself, what's a FIFRA?
[02:43:27.910 --> 02:43:30.992]  Why is this thing on the front pages?
[02:43:30.992 --> 02:43:32.453]  Oh, I'll tell you why.
[02:43:32.453 --> 02:43:35.416]  Because people are into sports.
[02:43:35.416 --> 02:43:36.997]  Oh, and you know what, Alex?
[02:43:36.997 --> 02:43:45.723]  We're going to have our Attorney General who's letting all the slimesters that are stealing from us that do nothing.
[02:43:45.723 --> 02:43:48.906]  We're going to go prosecute people in another country.
[02:43:48.906 --> 02:43:50.127]  And you know why, Alex?
[02:43:50.748 --> 02:43:57.913]  Because over a 24-year period, they stole up to $150 million.
[02:43:57.913 --> 02:44:01.676]  $150 million over 24 years.
[02:44:01.676 --> 02:44:08.761]  That's a second of stealing by the banks in the neo-feudal United States.
[02:44:08.761 --> 02:44:10.743]  That's what's going on.
[02:44:10.743 --> 02:44:13.485]  We are being pushed into a
[02:44:14.225 --> 02:44:16.628]  Hey, you think I'm making it up?
[02:44:16.628 --> 02:44:23.074]  Every time you see the President, the Secretary, or this or that, they got a plane.
[02:44:23.074 --> 02:44:29.381]  There's these 747s in red carpets and saluting everywhere.
[02:44:29.381 --> 02:44:31.123]  It's the nobility.
[02:44:33.863 --> 02:44:34.724]  Other news items.
[02:44:34.724 --> 02:44:35.484]  I mean, there's so much.
[02:44:35.484 --> 02:44:41.949]  What do you make of Bilderberg and a six-mile security perimeter threatening to arrest press if they step across an invisible line?
[02:44:41.949 --> 02:44:42.830]  There's not even fences up.
[02:44:42.830 --> 02:44:48.554]  They just say, don't come in here as if everybody's read the newspaper, or we're going to put you in jail for two weeks.
[02:44:48.554 --> 02:44:54.098]  They're flipping out on our reporters, and here are a bunch of known criminals meeting in secret to set policy.
[02:44:54.098 --> 02:44:57.941]  I think it's good news, though, that these shadow government organizations are being exposed.
[02:44:58.661 --> 02:45:00.182]  It's good news for the people.
[02:45:00.182 --> 02:45:03.383]  And again, I want to also pick up on what you said.
[02:45:03.383 --> 02:45:06.704]  It's very important for every, what can people do?
[02:45:06.704 --> 02:45:09.986]  They need to support, they need to buy the products that you're selling.
[02:45:09.986 --> 02:45:13.947]  You're putting out quality products that are going to improve people's lives.
[02:45:13.947 --> 02:45:17.329]  And by the way, that's another one of the big trends in the Trends Journal.
[02:45:17.329 --> 02:45:17.929]  Longevity.
[02:45:19.023 --> 02:45:26.825]  And so we're talking about, and my putting information out, they need to support us because you're right, it is big news.
[02:45:26.825 --> 02:45:38.827]  Because I remember learning about the Bilderbergs back, you know, in early 1980s when there was this newspaper, I think it was Liberty Lobby, that they ended up putting out of business.
[02:45:38.827 --> 02:45:44.928]  That this wonderful attorney I knew in Rhinebeck started turning me on to these things, an older cat.
[02:45:45.328 --> 02:45:46.971]  And now it's become common.
[02:45:46.971 --> 02:45:51.177]  But you ask me, what do I think about what they're doing, how they're cordoning off the area?
[02:45:51.177 --> 02:45:53.521]  They're the nobility!
[02:45:53.521 --> 02:45:56.105]  That's the way you protect the nobility!
[02:45:56.727 --> 02:45:58.868]  And that's what I'm trying to say.
[02:45:58.868 --> 02:46:02.530]  It's up to the people now to really do something.
[02:46:02.530 --> 02:46:05.472]  The power is in our hands.
[02:46:05.472 --> 02:46:11.936]  And if the people would only understand that, they wouldn't bow down to authority.
[02:46:11.936 --> 02:46:17.999]  They wouldn't applaud freaks that show up and call themselves candidates.
[02:46:17.999 --> 02:46:22.842]  And I'm sick of these presidential candidates talking tough.
[02:46:22.842 --> 02:46:24.923]  I mean, there's Lindsey Graham.
[02:46:25.370 --> 02:46:27.131]  You know what he's gonna do?
[02:46:27.131 --> 02:46:29.052]  What a thug Putin is!
[02:46:29.052 --> 02:46:32.654]  What is he gonna go over there and hit him with his handbag?
[02:46:32.654 --> 02:46:34.035]  I mean, come on!
[02:46:34.035 --> 02:46:40.019]  Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, these guys couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag!
[02:46:40.019 --> 02:46:46.743]  And they all talk tough, and they're talking tough to get our people killed and murder other millions.
[02:46:46.743 --> 02:46:48.304]  So what are the big trends?
[02:46:48.973 --> 02:46:58.262]  The trends on what people should do and how to prepare, and I don't give financial advice, you're seeing the volatility in the markets.
[02:46:58.262 --> 02:47:01.545]  You're seeing in the bond markets, you're seeing it on the oil markets.
[02:47:01.545 --> 02:47:03.427]  You're seeing it in the equity markets.
[02:47:03.427 --> 02:47:05.549]  I'm still in gold.
[02:47:05.549 --> 02:47:11.414]  And the other things, where do you see the big fears coming from?
[02:47:11.414 --> 02:47:14.317]  How many more scares do we have to have?
[02:47:14.801 --> 02:47:17.142]  Oh, this month it was eggs.
[02:47:17.142 --> 02:47:21.025]  A couple of months ago it was pork.
[02:47:21.025 --> 02:47:28.489]  Clean food, and clean water, and all the implements that make that happen.
[02:47:28.489 --> 02:47:30.450]  Self-sustaining.
[02:47:30.450 --> 02:47:35.953]  Those are the areas to look at, and the biggest, the biggest right now as we see it.
[02:47:35.953 --> 02:47:37.534]  Just to put this into perspective.
[02:47:38.112 --> 02:47:45.554]  They say that humans were created without getting into, you know, I don't know when, but they say a hundred thousand years ago.
[02:47:45.554 --> 02:47:52.895]  It took from a hundred thousand years ago to 1900 to put 1.6 billion people on the planet.
[02:47:52.895 --> 02:47:57.396]  In a hundred years, we've added almost six billion people.
[02:47:57.396 --> 02:48:00.837]  There's not enough stuff out there.
[02:48:00.837 --> 02:48:02.897]  There's not enough resources.
[02:48:03.422 --> 02:48:08.145]  In terms of clean food and clean water to support the planet.
[02:48:08.145 --> 02:48:10.287]  Those are the things to look into.
[02:48:10.287 --> 02:48:18.212]  And particularly, you saw the new study that just came out about the obesity rates ballooning worldwide.
[02:48:18.212 --> 02:48:21.554]  And hey, we are the exceptionals here in America.
[02:48:21.554 --> 02:48:23.255]  We're number one.
[02:48:23.255 --> 02:48:25.937]  So, where are the trends?
[02:48:25.937 --> 02:48:32.101]  The trends are all in this area, particularly with an aging baby boom population that's global.
[02:48:33.157 --> 02:48:35.378]  How are they going to age healthy?
[02:48:35.378 --> 02:48:39.559]  And it's not going to be medicine, it's going to be the mind.
[02:48:39.559 --> 02:48:53.822]  So, for example, if you're feeling down, you haven't made it in life, you're trying to start a new one, wouldn't it be nice to go to a longevity center where you could get in shape physically, emotionally, and spiritually?
[02:48:53.822 --> 02:48:57.043]  Learn how to create the future you haven't done before.
[02:48:57.043 --> 02:49:02.324]  Because your life is really, when you were talking about the founding fathers, they weren't kids!
[02:49:02.984 --> 02:49:09.130]  They were adults, they were the elderly, they were the ones that were respected.
[02:49:09.130 --> 02:49:21.161]  The markets for longevity centers, the markets for aging healthy, the markets for building community health, and then as the population ages, where are the real estate trends going to be?
[02:49:21.161 --> 02:49:23.583]  They're going to be on the outskirts
[02:49:24.934 --> 02:49:30.178]  You go to Florida and you say only lunatics could have invented this joint.
[02:49:30.178 --> 02:49:31.519]  There's no mass transportation.
[02:49:47.205 --> 02:49:48.546]  No rail.
[02:49:48.546 --> 02:49:50.326]  Yeah, they got buses.
[02:49:50.326 --> 02:49:59.070]  You see all these old people, all you see is that George Carlin joke, or Father Guido Sarducci, where you don't see the back of the head, you know?
[02:49:59.070 --> 02:50:01.731]  These old people driving these cars.
[02:50:01.731 --> 02:50:05.313]  So that's not the way to go into the future.
[02:50:05.313 --> 02:50:10.255]  So the future has a lot of opportunities, and the United States still has
[02:50:10.731 --> 02:50:15.174]  The greatest opportunity, as I see it, of any country in the world.
[02:50:15.174 --> 02:50:15.895]  Absolutely.
[02:50:15.895 --> 02:50:20.859]  Now, when we come back, we'll talk about the presidential reality show that you discussed in your New Trends Journal.
[02:50:20.859 --> 02:50:24.161]  Hillary Clinton being maneuvered in to be the president.
[02:50:24.161 --> 02:50:29.906]  Her chief of staff, basically, her top advisors at Bilderberg, that means they're behind her.
[02:50:29.906 --> 02:50:34.229]  She's been many times before, been fined, Logan Act.
[02:50:34.229 --> 02:50:38.613]  It just illustrates for me, it's emblematic of how arrogant they are.
[02:50:39.761 --> 02:50:47.769]  Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton, the optics of these imperial wannabe families, why not just give them crowns?
[02:50:47.769 --> 02:50:49.851]  What's the difference between Queen Elizabeth and Kim Jong-un?
[02:50:49.851 --> 02:50:52.894]  One doesn't have a crown, the other does.
[02:50:52.894 --> 02:50:59.040]  And, as one senator said, is the presidency a crown passed between two families?
[02:51:00.922 --> 02:51:03.024]  Not available in California, Louisiana, and Virginia.
[02:51:20.717 --> 02:51:25.200]  We're growing so fast that we've had hundreds of new franchise owners in the last few years alone.
[02:51:25.200 --> 02:51:26.341]  Now, you can join them.
[02:51:26.341 --> 02:51:33.106]  This area has a huge demand for fresh, healthy, organic snacks on the go, and that's exactly what you'll be selling with your fresh, healthy vending machines.
[02:51:33.106 --> 02:51:37.229]  We've already identified prime high-traffic locations that are perfect for healthy vending machines.
[02:51:37.329 --> 02:51:38.249]  When you're listening to the radio,
[02:52:02.739 --> 02:52:05.220]  We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin.

[02:52:54.372 --> 02:52:58.735]  That's 30dayfoodsupply.com at 800-700-2184.
[02:52:58.735 --> 02:53:02.497]  Honey, it's time for dinner.
[02:53:02.497 --> 02:53:04.359]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[02:53:04.359 --> 02:53:05.860]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[02:53:05.860 --> 02:53:07.401]  Mine is falling apart.
[02:53:07.401 --> 02:53:13.585]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[02:53:13.585 --> 02:53:16.787]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[02:53:16.787 --> 02:53:17.328]  What is that?
[02:53:17.628 --> 02:53:27.156]  Well, apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[02:53:27.156 --> 02:53:35.884]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[02:53:35.884 --> 02:53:36.504]  Wow!
[02:53:36.504 --> 02:53:37.845]  That sounds scary.
[02:53:37.845 --> 02:53:42.289]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold shielded wallet.
[02:53:42.289 --> 02:53:43.110]  Are they more expensive?
[02:53:43.550 --> 02:53:44.051]  No.
[02:53:44.051 --> 02:53:51.740]  In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from IDStronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[02:53:51.740 --> 02:53:52.921]  Sounds great!
[02:53:52.921 --> 02:53:55.564]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[02:53:55.564 --> 02:53:59.629]  I want to be protected and these wallets at IDStronghold.com look fantastic!
[02:54:21.764 --> 02:54:24.765]  A little piece of me.
[02:54:24.765 --> 02:54:27.666]  We'll die.
[02:54:27.666 --> 02:54:29.466]  For the system.
[02:54:29.466 --> 02:54:35.828]  That is David Bowie bringing us in.
[02:54:48.783 --> 02:54:52.604]  Broadcasting worldwide here in the final segment with Gerald Cilente.
[02:54:52.604 --> 02:54:56.565]  I got three children.
[02:54:56.565 --> 02:55:00.245]  We've got an article on Infowars.com, evil quotes by Bilderberg Group members.
[02:55:00.245 --> 02:55:03.506]  Most of these quotes are public that they put in books.
[02:55:03.506 --> 02:55:05.086]  I mean, these are some nasty people.
[02:55:05.086 --> 02:55:06.767]  These are totalitarians.
[02:55:06.767 --> 02:55:10.627]  And they're trying to rebrand it right now.
[02:55:10.627 --> 02:55:13.848]  Kit Daniels' stories, excellent.
[02:55:13.848 --> 02:55:15.048]  Kurt Nimmo's excellent.
[02:55:15.048 --> 02:55:18.329]  All of Steve Watson, Don Salazar, all our great reporters.
[02:55:21.465 --> 02:55:22.886]  I try to list them all, the show will be over.
[02:55:22.886 --> 02:55:25.487]  Mikkel Thelen.
[02:55:25.487 --> 02:55:27.648]  All the people behind the scenes, camera, TV.
[02:55:27.648 --> 02:55:36.331]  You know, Gnarls Barkley's song says, was I crazy because I didn't know enough or because I knew too much?
[02:55:36.331 --> 02:55:37.772]  I just know way too much now.
[02:55:38.951 --> 02:55:39.931]  I'm not bragging either.
[02:55:39.931 --> 02:55:41.792]  It's not hard to figure out history and what's happening.
[02:55:41.792 --> 02:55:43.993]  Once you figure it out, it's a lot of stuff.
[02:55:43.993 --> 02:55:46.673]  It's kind of like if you watch baseball, you learn how baseball works.
[02:55:46.673 --> 02:55:51.375]  I've been watching the Globalists for 25 years, and man, they seem to be getting worse.
[02:55:51.375 --> 02:55:54.596]  They seem to be getting more reckless, more wild, more crazy.
[02:55:54.596 --> 02:55:57.377]  I mean, what about the Russia situation, Gerald?
[02:55:57.377 --> 02:55:58.797]  I mean, we opened the interview with that.
[02:55:58.797 --> 02:56:01.298]  I mean, they're sitting in armor.
[02:56:01.298 --> 02:56:04.239]  There's video of Western troops battling the Russians.
[02:56:04.239 --> 02:56:05.279]  That's Russian area.
[02:56:05.279 --> 02:56:07.140]  It's always been part of Russia, off and on.
[02:56:09.102 --> 02:56:10.423]  It's not Iraq.
[02:56:10.423 --> 02:56:15.488]  I mean, the globalists couldn't hold Iraq.
[02:56:15.488 --> 02:56:17.690]  Why do they want to attack Russia?
[02:56:17.690 --> 02:56:23.155]  Russia's just trying to stabilize itself.
[02:56:23.155 --> 02:56:25.017]  Why do the globalists have this instinct?
[02:56:25.017 --> 02:56:26.819]  I guess your audio was cutting out for a moment.
[02:56:26.819 --> 02:56:29.241]  Why do the globalists have this instinct to try to wreck everything?
[02:56:29.241 --> 02:56:29.802]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:32.421]  Yeah, it's the neocons.
[02:56:32.421 --> 02:56:37.423]  It's that, you know, the Kagan's, the Newland, or the wife of Kagan.
[02:56:37.423 --> 02:56:39.264]  And it's this sick mentality.
[02:56:39.264 --> 02:56:40.964]  They're crazy people.
[02:56:40.964 --> 02:56:44.266]  And everybody's afraid to call a spade a spade.
[02:56:44.266 --> 02:56:45.686]  They're megalomaniacs.
[02:56:45.686 --> 02:56:47.367]  They're psychopaths.
[02:56:47.367 --> 02:56:49.788]  And by their deeds, you shall know them.
[02:56:49.788 --> 02:57:00.272]  And of course, everyone knows the deal that wants to know it, was that when Gorbachev made the deal with Reagan, was that NATO wasn't going to expand beyond the borders of where they were.
[02:57:01.064 --> 02:57:04.886]  And under Clinton, they started doing it, excelled under Bush.
[02:57:04.886 --> 02:57:10.448]  And now, of course, we have American troops in Estonia, Lithuania.
[02:57:10.448 --> 02:57:15.130]  Let's not forget, the UN admits that the Croats and the Muslims killed double what the Serbs did.
[02:57:15.130 --> 02:57:16.030]  They started the fight.
[02:57:16.030 --> 02:57:18.211]  Again, I'm not lionizing the Serbs, but they started it.
[02:57:18.211 --> 02:57:25.054]  We gave them a third of their country, blew up their infrastructure, their power plants, water, TV stations, and then put
[02:57:25.794 --> 02:57:26.194]  Exactly.
[02:57:26.194 --> 02:57:27.856]  And again, you know, it's...
[02:57:43.119 --> 02:57:45.841]  You asked about, you know, why are they doing it with Russia?
[02:57:45.841 --> 02:57:48.383]  And I was talking about FIFRA before.
[02:57:48.383 --> 02:57:50.024]  What was that really about?
[02:57:50.024 --> 02:57:51.005]  Russia.
[02:57:51.005 --> 02:57:52.386]  It's really about Russia.
[02:57:52.386 --> 02:57:58.551]  And again, because most people know about sports, they made it a sporting issue.
[02:57:58.551 --> 02:58:07.819]  So that then the people that don't tune into anything, all of a sudden are tuned into something, and they know about it because it was about Russia.
[02:58:07.819 --> 02:58:10.861]  You go back to our Spring 2014 Trends Journal,
[02:58:12.512 --> 02:58:21.503]  And it was about the Ukraine crisis and how we showed how they used the Sociolympics to lead up to the Ukraine crisis.
[02:58:21.503 --> 02:58:22.023]  Sure, sure.
[02:58:22.023 --> 02:58:22.444]  Stay there.
[02:58:22.444 --> 02:58:24.346]  Let's do five more minutes if we can to finish up this point.
[02:58:24.346 --> 02:58:30.233]  This is important because they want to isolate Russia so they can then point at them and say, look, they're totally isolated when they kick them out of G7.
[02:58:31.634 --> 02:58:35.498]  And then now, take away their World Cup.
[02:58:35.498 --> 02:58:37.500]  So they can't have anything for their economy.
[02:58:37.500 --> 02:58:40.603]  I mean, it is economic warfare, as Ron Paul has said.
[02:58:40.603 --> 02:58:41.924]  It is an embargo.
[02:58:41.924 --> 02:58:45.147]  Five more minutes with the Trends Forecaster, Gerald Celente.
[02:58:45.147 --> 02:58:45.948]  Stay with us.
[02:58:45.948 --> 02:58:48.150]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.808 --> 02:58:59.891]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:58:59.891 --> 02:59:07.994]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:08.294 --> 02:59:13.177]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:13.177 --> 02:59:19.960]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:19.960 --> 02:59:27.144]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:59:27.144 --> 02:59:33.987]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:59:34.147 --> 02:59:38.631]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:59:38.631 --> 02:59:42.034]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[02:59:48.340 --> 02:59:52.964]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:52.964 --> 02:59:55.567]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:03.712 --> 03:00:10.339]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:10.339 --> 03:00:17.566]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.566 --> 03:00:19.248]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:19.248 --> 03:00:21.170]  Gerald Fuentes, stay with us five more minutes.
[03:00:22.947 --> 03:00:28.369]  Check out his Trends Journal at TrendsResearch.com or TrendsJournal.com.
[03:00:28.369 --> 03:00:30.210]  You're getting into this Russia situation.
[03:00:30.210 --> 03:00:32.511]  It's just crazy is the word.
[03:00:32.511 --> 03:00:33.652]  I keep overusing it.
[03:00:33.652 --> 03:00:39.114]  It just shows an arrogance, a bravado, a chutzpah.
[03:00:39.114 --> 03:00:40.975]  Do you agree with me that it is getting worse?
[03:00:40.975 --> 03:00:44.597]  They are getting more insane or is it just we know more about it now, Gerald?
[03:00:44.597 --> 03:00:47.858]  No, they're more insane because smart people would do this.
[03:00:47.858 --> 03:00:51.240]  You made the point about, look, they can't win in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[03:00:51.963 --> 03:00:52.784]  Libya's a mess.
[03:00:52.784 --> 03:00:54.945]  You're gonna beat the Russians.
[03:00:54.945 --> 03:00:57.427]  I mean, Napoleon couldn't pull it off.
[03:00:57.427 --> 03:01:02.410]  Hitler launched the largest military offensive in world history, and he couldn't do it.
[03:01:02.410 --> 03:01:03.811]  It'll be the end of life!
[03:01:03.811 --> 03:01:06.733]  It'll be what Einstein said.
[03:01:06.733 --> 03:01:12.057]  I don't know how the Third World War will be fought, but the Fourth will be fought with sticks and stones.
[03:01:12.057 --> 03:01:14.599]  Invading Russia would be like invading the U.S.
[03:01:14.599 --> 03:01:16.380]  Everybody's gonna fight!
[03:01:16.380 --> 03:01:17.041]  Exactly.
[03:01:17.041 --> 03:01:18.862]  It'll be annihilation.
[03:01:19.781 --> 03:01:30.553]  And so the neocons think, and the military industrial complex, by putting more weapons on the Russian border, they won't be able to retaliate.
[03:01:30.553 --> 03:01:31.694]  They're out of their mind.
[03:01:32.409 --> 03:01:37.912]  And again, going back to how they're using the propaganda, they use this fifth for example.
[03:01:37.912 --> 03:01:43.615]  I said, when we wrote about it in the Trends Journal back a year ago, how they use the Sociolympics.
[03:01:43.615 --> 03:01:46.797]  You remember, don't get on a plane to go there.
[03:01:46.797 --> 03:01:49.599]  They got toothpaste bombings, I tell you.
[03:01:49.599 --> 03:01:51.840]  Oh, and those Black Widow bombings?
[03:01:51.840 --> 03:01:53.141]  They're there too.
[03:01:53.141 --> 03:01:55.062]  And you know what else, Alex?
[03:01:55.062 --> 03:01:56.663]  The water is all yellow.
[03:01:57.376 --> 03:02:01.218]  And they shoot stray dogs and hate homophobes.
[03:02:01.218 --> 03:02:19.168]  By the time the Winter Olympics began in Sochi, 57% of Americans believed there would be a terror strike, and the ratings of America's attitude toward Russia was at a 1993 low.
[03:02:19.168 --> 03:02:23.571]  They're using the propaganda and disgusting human beings
[03:02:26.628 --> 03:02:33.354]  What was Russia's crime?
[03:02:33.354 --> 03:02:37.598]  Arresting all the Rockefeller and Rothschild banker fronts that came out in court?
[03:02:37.598 --> 03:02:38.339]  And kicking them out?
[03:02:38.339 --> 03:02:39.840]  I mean, what was Russia's big crime?
[03:02:39.840 --> 03:02:44.044]  I mean, I guess, not accelerating their population decline?
[03:02:44.044 --> 03:02:45.325]  Having pro-family events?
[03:02:45.325 --> 03:02:46.967]  I mean, what did Russia do that made them so mad?
[03:02:48.446 --> 03:02:58.477]  It's Russia is a threat because of these sick people that believe that the United States is going to be the superpower around the world.
[03:02:58.477 --> 03:03:01.680]  And they just don't want to have any competition.
[03:03:01.680 --> 03:03:03.282]  You read their work.
[03:03:04.349 --> 03:03:06.610]  They should be in an insane asylum.
[03:03:06.610 --> 03:03:17.235]  Speaking of which, you heard Rumsfeld come out about how now he's not so sure about Iraq and it wasn't good to try to export democracy.
[03:03:17.235 --> 03:03:18.636]  Who's he talking about?
[03:03:18.636 --> 03:03:21.077]  This is the little clown that lied.
[03:03:21.077 --> 03:03:23.899]  We know where those WMDs are.
[03:03:23.899 --> 03:03:25.819]  They're east, they're north, they're south.
[03:03:25.819 --> 03:03:26.760]  You remember that.
[03:03:27.180 --> 03:03:31.122]  You remember him coming out that the world is better off without Saddam Hussein.
[03:03:31.122 --> 03:03:32.563]  And then he said he never said that.
[03:03:32.563 --> 03:03:36.004]  Then he said he never said they were north of Tikrit.
[03:03:36.004 --> 03:03:37.965]  Oh yeah, I have the quote, it's there.
[03:03:37.965 --> 03:03:40.747]  Oh I know, he's an incredible liar, almost as good as Obama.
[03:03:40.747 --> 03:03:43.928]  And that's what I'm saying when you ask who these people are.
[03:03:43.928 --> 03:03:48.050]  They're sick people and no one wants to call them that.
[03:03:48.050 --> 03:03:53.653]  Instead they call them Secretary of this, President that, a Prime Minister, a Chancellor.
[03:03:54.861 --> 03:03:58.225]  Well, and I want to point out, a lot of folks go, good, they want America to dominate the world.
[03:03:58.225 --> 03:03:58.906]  No they don't.
[03:03:58.906 --> 03:04:03.051]  The very same globalists are targeting small farms, small ranches, small industry.
[03:04:03.051 --> 03:04:04.073]  They're monopoly men.
[03:04:04.073 --> 03:04:09.299]  They're worldwide using American muscle to take over the planet while we get the blame.
[03:04:09.299 --> 03:04:10.701]  So let's be clear.
[03:04:10.701 --> 03:04:13.504]  They want to screw Russia over, they want to screw us over as well.
[03:04:14.363 --> 03:04:15.444]  You got it.
[03:04:15.444 --> 03:04:16.865]  And that's one of the stories.
[03:04:16.865 --> 03:04:18.747]  It's the grand manipulation.
[03:04:18.747 --> 03:04:19.908]  It's a takeover.
[03:04:19.908 --> 03:04:22.370]  It's a multinational takeover.
[03:04:22.370 --> 03:04:26.773]  And they've turned this country into slavelandia.
[03:04:26.773 --> 03:04:30.216]  We talk about why the markets are going up.
[03:04:30.216 --> 03:04:32.738]  Two reasons and two reasons only.
[03:04:32.738 --> 03:04:35.821]  The cheap money allows companies to buy back their stock.
[03:04:36.241 --> 03:04:39.725]  And the other one is mergers and acquisitions.
[03:04:39.725 --> 03:04:47.252]  So that the big could gobble up more, fire people, and give them no money to work there.
[03:04:47.252 --> 03:04:48.433]  Isn't it wonderful?
[03:04:48.433 --> 03:04:51.536]  Walmart is going to pay $10 an hour.
[03:04:51.536 --> 03:04:56.000]  Half of their employees are part-time workers.
[03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:56.721]  You're right, Gerald.
[03:04:56.721 --> 03:04:57.802]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:57.802 --> 03:04:58.182]  Thank you.
[03:04:58.182 --> 03:04:58.883]  Powerful interview.
