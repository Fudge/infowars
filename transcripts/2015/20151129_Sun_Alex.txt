[00:00:01.158 --> 00:00:23.687]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:24.647 --> 00:00:26.788]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:27.248 --> 00:00:28.669]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.421]  Sunday the 29th day of November 2015.
[00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:47.382]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:47.402 --> 00:00:50.602]  We'll be here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:50.682 --> 00:00:51.742]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:52.483 --> 00:00:54.923]  Then we return of course weekdays 11 a.m.
[00:00:54.943 --> 00:00:55.543]  to 3 p.m.
[00:00:55.583 --> 00:01:02.145]  Central Standard Time with a four-hour radio broadcast that's been on air syndicated since 1998.
[00:01:02.185 --> 00:01:07.106]  Been on air period since 1995.
[00:01:07.186 --> 00:01:08.926]  Again thank you so much for joining us.
[00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:15.734]  We all have these moments from time to time, but I really had one last night and this morning.
[00:01:17.997 --> 00:01:27.192]  Completely crystallized, laid out basis of geopolitical affairs and exactly the real forces that humanity is facing.
[00:01:29.246 --> 00:01:43.132]  Now obviously the mind can have complex geopolitical and philosophical discussions with itself that are harder to put down on paper or orate via a live multimedia teleprompter free transmission.
[00:01:43.972 --> 00:01:48.814]  But I'm going to do the best I can today because we really are in incredibly important times.
[00:01:51.315 --> 00:01:57.098]  And I'm not going to mince words with people about the point in human history that we've now currently reached.
[00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:05.029]  I shot a video yesterday, came up here to the office, emergency alert, World War III, question mark.
[00:02:07.612 --> 00:02:09.653]  And the video is beginning to go viral today.
[00:02:12.295 --> 00:02:14.397]  The story is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.380]  And you know, I wish some of the trolls were right.
[00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:21.823]  It's got 3,217 pro votes, 211 negative votes, 95% pro, like most our videos.
[00:02:29.138 --> 00:02:40.603]  But I address the people in denial because they're the type of people that the establishment wants to produce.
[00:02:42.123 --> 00:02:43.564]  So they are the prodigal sons.
[00:02:43.604 --> 00:02:45.085]  They're the people we really care about.
[00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:52.368]  We're not in some sardonic power trip that they're so dumbed down and ignorant and confused.
[00:02:52.708 --> 00:02:55.369]  We understand their ignorance is our weakness collectively.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.761]  But here's CNN's headline.
[00:03:00.201 --> 00:03:01.801]  How is this not World War Three?
[00:03:03.502 --> 00:03:04.882]  Here is the New York Times.
[00:03:05.402 --> 00:03:06.283]  World War Three.
[00:03:11.605 --> 00:03:17.787]  Former CIA operative Robert Baer came out and said, get ready for World War Three.
[00:03:20.007 --> 00:03:20.848]  World War Three.
[00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:23.068]  What would really happen in a nuclear war?
[00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:24.549]  Metro News.
[00:03:26.175 --> 00:03:28.097]  Has World War III already started?
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.063]  Pat Buchanan says that we're stumbling towards war with Russia.
[00:03:36.765 --> 00:03:45.612]  What's funny is almost all analysts say this has the makings of a major world war and the most dangerous times is the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 1960s.
[00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:50.277]  And then I watch decadent, dumbed-down people
[00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:52.664]  Who really are mentally ill.
[00:03:52.704 --> 00:03:53.605]  This country is sick.
[00:03:54.245 --> 00:03:54.985]  And I love this country.
[00:03:55.005 --> 00:03:55.885]  I'm being honest about that.
[00:03:56.385 --> 00:04:00.306]  We probably all had a family member or somebody that has a drug problem, an alcohol problem, or is mentally ill.
[00:04:00.766 --> 00:04:03.067]  And you love them, you care about them, but man, you know what?
[00:04:03.107 --> 00:04:05.007]  You're not going to sit around and be bossed around by them.
[00:04:06.828 --> 00:04:08.788]  You're not going to let their mental illness dictate your life.
[00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:13.910]  And the fact that the establishment thinks they can suspend the rules of war,
[00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:29.803]  in history and the fact that so many minions out there living on the bones of the liberty that our forebears produced to sit around and shoot your mouths off while we are edging towards massive regional war bare minimum.
[00:04:31.925 --> 00:04:35.087]  Huge proxy war, one of the biggest in history going on right now.
[00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.171]  Russia moving in
[00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:46.766]  High-tech missiles that can blow up any of our aircraft into Syria.
[00:04:48.748 --> 00:04:49.829]  It's an epic time to be alive.
[00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:53.713]  And, you know, I wish this was all a joke.
[00:04:55.114 --> 00:04:57.116]  I wish the trolls making jokes were right.
[00:04:57.176 --> 00:04:57.616]  Believe me.
[00:04:58.237 --> 00:04:59.138]  But see, I'm a man.
[00:04:59.838 --> 00:05:00.779]  So I live in the real world.
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.703]  And I'm forced to choose sides for who has the moral high ground.
[00:05:05.424 --> 00:05:06.004]  That's what I do.
[00:05:06.064 --> 00:05:06.525]  We'll be back.
[00:05:06.545 --> 00:05:06.805]  Stay with us.
[00:05:06.825 --> 00:05:07.726]  It's a very important broadcast.

[00:06:21.818 --> 00:06:24.019]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:26.980]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:29.782]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:06:31.937 --> 00:07:00.564]  Bad luck wind been blowin' at my back I was born to bring trouble to wherever I'm at Got the number 13 tattooed on my neck When the ink starts to itch then the black will turn to red
[00:07:05.798 --> 00:07:11.423]  Everybody's heard the story about the dodo bird.
[00:07:11.523 --> 00:07:16.427]  And if you look it up, the dodo bird lived on a small chain of islands.
[00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:19.010]  Was it out in the Pacific Ocean?
[00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.391]  I'm going for memory, we can pull it up.
[00:07:21.532 --> 00:07:23.814]  And it never had any natural predator.
[00:07:24.995 --> 00:07:29.700]  So it was a flightless bird, big and fat, lots of meat on it, basically an island turkey.
[00:07:31.144 --> 00:07:34.025]  Not related to the turkey, but a large fat juicy bird.
[00:07:34.805 --> 00:07:42.467]  And so sailors within just 30 years or so of those islands being discovered had eaten all the birds and had killed the last ones.
[00:07:47.308 --> 00:07:50.769]  And that's again east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean by the Pacific Ocean.
[00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:56.544]  And I liken the American people and the people of the West to dodo birds.
[00:07:56.564 --> 00:08:01.127]  That's why you call someone a dodo when they just are stupid and they can't get something through their head.
[00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:03.549]  I love America.
[00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:05.390]  I love the West.
[00:08:05.591 --> 00:08:06.611]  I'm a big fan of the West.
[00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:07.772]  The West is under attack.
[00:08:07.812 --> 00:08:08.873]  The West is being dismantled.
[00:08:11.195 --> 00:08:13.916]  And there are globalist forces on record.
[00:08:14.436 --> 00:08:16.976]  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, they're the main authors of it all.
[00:08:17.316 --> 00:08:26.658]  Open borders, taking your guns, attacking the family, starting wars with Russia, funding IS, running narcotics in and out of the country en masse.
[00:08:27.398 --> 00:08:29.239]  Even comes out in the newspaper, nobody gets in trouble.
[00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:31.379]  Warren Buffett, Wells Fargo, Wachovia.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.020]  Biggest recipients of banker bailouts.
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.981]  They are a pack of globalists.
[00:08:40.745 --> 00:08:41.085]  Thieves.
[00:08:45.647 --> 00:08:52.310]  And the only thing that challenges them is chivalry.
[00:08:55.732 --> 00:09:01.914]  And I really have done deep thinking on this subject, and I've talked some about it, but I tell you, I need to write a book or produce a film on this subject.
[00:09:01.934 --> 00:09:05.576]  I don't know what you title it, The Keys to Saving Humanity?
[00:09:09.946 --> 00:09:13.668]  And I've been on air all these years trying to wake people up and get people involved to fight tyranny.
[00:09:13.688 --> 00:09:14.669]  We've had some success.
[00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:24.554]  But always looking for other people to be leaders in this fight, I realized that I've got to be a leader in this fight and not just try to wake people up.
[00:09:25.095 --> 00:09:27.416]  It's my responsibility to give specific solutions.
[00:09:29.164 --> 00:09:40.729]  And our main crisis is that we are losing the basic human programming, the basic human systems that allowed us to survive, thrive, and conquer this planet.
[00:09:44.931 --> 00:09:50.914]  And that is the ultimate sin committed by the globalists, is they are seeking to make us basically deaf, dumb, and blind dodo birds.
[00:09:52.062 --> 00:10:01.267]  Because our free will and our human activity and our human capacity to try to direct our own destinies gets in the way of these people playing God.
[00:10:06.249 --> 00:10:08.190]  Now, I've got incredible news with Russia.
[00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.032]  Mainstream media admitting World War III could break out.
[00:10:11.592 --> 00:10:15.934]  Huge news on the Planned Parenthood situation with Obama saying enough is enough.
[00:10:15.974 --> 00:10:17.015]  He's coming after our guns.
[00:10:17.055 --> 00:10:17.635]  That's a quote.
[00:10:17.835 --> 00:10:18.815]  CNN, enough is enough.
[00:10:20.596 --> 00:10:21.537]  Huge developments.
[00:10:23.348 --> 00:10:35.764]  On the World Government Carbon Tax Initiative that started today, the 29th of November, and will run for two weeks in Paris, France, establishing open world government.
[00:10:35.944 --> 00:10:36.846]  Here's the Drudge headline.
[00:10:37.286 --> 00:10:39.970]  Leaders gather to save the world, close quote.
[00:10:41.104 --> 00:10:43.465]  Give them unlimited taxes and limited regulations.
[00:10:44.046 --> 00:10:44.866]  They will save you.
[00:10:45.206 --> 00:10:48.388]  Whether global warming was real or not, it's all a fraud, folks.
[00:10:49.308 --> 00:10:52.970]  India's now been told they've got to make massive coal cuts.
[00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.311]  Now 160 plus of the third world countries don't.
[00:10:56.052 --> 00:11:04.176]  India had signed on to all this because they got Britain's steel industry and other facilities, other value-added products.
[00:11:05.617 --> 00:11:09.919]  But now they're being told they've got to make massive cuts and they are freaking out.
[00:11:11.049 --> 00:11:16.430]  They're like, but Mexico and China and 160 plus other countries don't have to.
[00:11:16.991 --> 00:11:19.571]  And they said, sorry, that's what the treaty says.
[00:11:22.112 --> 00:11:24.452]  Because you're not the chosen ones in India, are you?
[00:11:25.533 --> 00:11:29.754]  No, they're going to build three new coal power plants a week in China.
[00:11:31.074 --> 00:11:32.515]  And you're going to have to close yours.
[00:11:35.435 --> 00:11:38.056]  Because it's been decided that you're not going to be allowed to prosper.
[00:11:39.494 --> 00:11:40.854]  Oh, you don't like that discrimination?
[00:11:40.954 --> 00:11:41.434]  Sorry!
[00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:49.236]  See, there's more discrimination going on than people not bowing down to Caitlyn Jenner, the snapping turtle that wears a wig.
[00:11:51.317 --> 00:11:53.437]  There's bigger discrimination going on, isn't there?
[00:11:54.437 --> 00:11:55.217]  Against all of us.
[00:11:56.078 --> 00:12:06.440]  By the global crime cartel that's a private group of corporations, openly above the law, with diplomatic immunity, now levying world taxes, and setting to establish a treaty in the next two weeks.
[00:12:07.734 --> 00:12:13.899]  In Paris, France, to arrest anyone criticizing anthropogenic climate change.
[00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:14.739]  Period.
[00:12:19.443 --> 00:12:35.935]  Now all of this epic stuff is happening, but I first just want to speak about the nature of the world and just a brief snapshot, oversimplified because history is so complex, but still the basis of what's happened to understand geopolitically what's going on in this world.
[00:12:38.191 --> 00:12:50.776]  And Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief with his piercing analysis on the situation in Russia, the situation in Ukraine, the situation in Syria and more will be joining us and will be taking your calls the second half of the interview with him.
[00:12:53.298 --> 00:13:01.721]  But if you want to understand how the world works, let's just fast forward to 1815, the Battle of Waterloo.
[00:13:03.993 --> 00:13:09.255]  And what took the British Empire from being the dominant world empire to being the great world empire.
[00:13:12.756 --> 00:13:16.877]  And that was the Rothschilds funding Napoleon but also the British on both sides.
[00:13:17.698 --> 00:13:20.279]  The Prussians funding all sides of the war.
[00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:21.539]  Millions dead.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:33.083]  Then having carrier pigeon after a fast Corvette ship made it across the English Channel hours before the news got back that
[00:13:36.041 --> 00:13:37.782]  Lord Wellington had won the war.
[00:13:39.703 --> 00:13:41.223]  And then Napoleon had capitulated.
[00:13:44.284 --> 00:13:50.467]  And they crashed the stock market 99% plus by announcing that Napoleon had won.
[00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:57.050]  And Lord Rothschild then bought up the stock market during that period.
[00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:04.453]  And so literally owned the British monarchy, which was already basically German and Hungarian and Transylvanian.
[00:14:06.792 --> 00:14:13.254]  So nothing is as it seems, and they were able to take the whole world over, basically, at that time, except for pockets of old empires.
[00:14:18.115 --> 00:14:32.139]  Now, fast-forwarding, the German houses that supplied the royalty to all of Europe wanted to take out Tsar Nicholas in 1917.
[00:14:34.448 --> 00:14:36.029]  This is all in mainline history books.
[00:14:36.129 --> 00:14:37.310]  You'll understand what's happening now.
[00:14:37.511 --> 00:14:40.453]  Our government, the British government, funded hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:43.956]  Famous train of 25 million dollars of gold was just one shipment.
[00:14:45.277 --> 00:15:01.972]  And hundreds of thousands of quote American volunteers out of the East Coast to go there by ship and to enter into Europe and take trains into Russia and to overthrow the government of
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.684]  Russia to kill the British throne's cousin.
[00:15:08.924 --> 00:15:17.391]  They were so basically identically bred that if you look at the King of England at the time and you look at Tsar Nicholas, you can't tell they're different people.
[00:15:18.391 --> 00:15:23.175]  Same uniform, same outfit, same look, same eye spacing, same hairline.
[00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:23.715]  It's the same.
[00:15:23.735 --> 00:15:24.756]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:15:26.498 --> 00:15:28.139]  The amount of breeding that goes into these people.
[00:15:30.993 --> 00:15:33.194]  And they literally did what royals always do.
[00:15:33.435 --> 00:15:43.821]  They killed off their competition and they put horrible, horrible Leninist Trotskyites in who killed more than 20 million Russians.
[00:15:45.803 --> 00:15:48.985]  Slaughtered the entire military, leadership, everybody.
[00:15:50.506 --> 00:15:55.249]  Now, 90 plus years later, the Russians have finally thrown that off.
[00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:05.011]  Remember, the globalists created Hitler to take out Russia.

[00:20:02.745 --> 00:20:04.907]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:04.987 --> 00:20:06.829]  They took my saddle in Houston
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:33.702]  Alright, continuing with just a snapshot history of the last hundred years in Russia.
[00:20:33.802 --> 00:20:42.064]  We're talking 98 years since the Bolshevik Resolution was funded by the West.
[00:20:55.222 --> 00:21:08.708]  by capitalists to bring down Russia and then to have special client deals with the Soviet Union and have the captured Russian engine be used to project collectivism and tyranny all over the world.
[00:21:09.949 --> 00:21:20.454]  Then, out of the dialectic, the West would counter that by its own militaristic expansions that would actually cover up the imperial nature of it.
[00:21:22.253 --> 00:21:29.736]  And of course, the irony is you have the old Soviets calling us the imperialists when they were imperialists, and then we're calling them communists when they're really imperialists.
[00:21:31.557 --> 00:21:33.617]  That's all it is, is imperialism by another name.
[00:21:34.017 --> 00:21:35.198]  Conquest by another name.
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:45.766]  And for a long story short, Alexander Sholzhenitsyn, one of the people credited with bringing down the Soviet Union, it was not really Reagan and the FDI and the weapons and all the rest of it.
[00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:49.329]  It was ideological ideas that brought down the Soviet Union to a great extent.
[00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:53.652]  Because young people and intellectuals read Gulag Archipelago.
[00:21:54.372 --> 00:21:59.616]  And whether you believe his conversion or not, Vladimir Putin read it when he was in the KGB.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:21.935]  And we know that he became a national hero before his death, and was praised on national television, and they repudiated communism, all the rest of it, and Russia has gone from pushing an anti-family agenda to promoting families, promoting male role models, paying people to have kids, the opposite of what happens here.
[00:22:23.296 --> 00:22:25.738]  And so for all of Russia's problems, and believe me, there are many,
[00:22:28.257 --> 00:22:40.123]  Russia has come out and said man-made global warming and carbon taxes are a global fraud to establish planetary government and are a military assault on industry and selective nations to shut down competition.
[00:22:40.964 --> 00:22:42.184]  Well, that's exactly what it is.
[00:22:42.204 --> 00:22:44.526]  It's not our opinion, that's what it is.
[00:22:45.666 --> 00:22:49.348]  And Russia comes out and says the United States and others are funding ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[00:22:49.748 --> 00:22:52.630]  And then now it's forced mainstream media to go, okay, it's actually true.
[00:22:56.806 --> 00:22:57.946]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:22:58.046 --> 00:23:05.709]  So you have to understand that people are hungry for opposition to globalism.
[00:23:05.749 --> 00:23:09.490]  They're hungry for strong leaders that stand up against it like Vladimir Putin.
[00:23:11.711 --> 00:23:13.611]  We're hungry for a George Washington here.
[00:23:17.713 --> 00:23:21.554]  But the truth is Russia tried to go along with the West for the last
[00:23:24.889 --> 00:23:27.671]  15 plus years since Vladimir Putin got into power in 99.
[00:23:28.532 --> 00:23:48.524]  And all we've seen is the West try to launch overthrows of the government of Russia, overthrow satellites of Russia, overthrow border regions with Russia, start wars, take over their only two military bases outside Russia, and pushing the world towards conflict.
[00:23:48.544 --> 00:23:50.065]  And I'm going to cover that in the next segment.
[00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:57.438]  But you have to understand that the globalists don't want us to have a culture.
[00:23:57.478 --> 00:24:04.901]  They want it to be an MTV, CNN, plastic culture they can change day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month, year-to-year.
[00:24:06.821 --> 00:24:10.582]  They want emasculated men, they want dumbed-down populations, and they've done it.
[00:24:13.263 --> 00:24:18.005]  The globalists have put the United States through the exact same program they're trying to put Russia through.
[00:24:19.764 --> 00:24:44.334]  And Russia, after 80 plus years of being under Bolshevik nightmare rule, was able to struggle out of it to a certain extent and they arrested scores of billionaire oligarchs who had been controlling the Soviet Union when it collapsed and in almost every case, read the British newspapers, the Rothschilds sued over this and lost.
[00:24:45.529 --> 00:24:49.670]  Newspapers will report another oligarch turns out to be Rothschild Front.
[00:24:52.631 --> 00:25:12.678]  And it turned out all these agents inside Russia that controlled it with Boris Yeltsin at the end of the Soviet Union were inside operatives who'd been there and whose families had been there since the beginning of the Bolshevik Revolution when their families out of England, out of the United States, came in and took those areas over.
[00:25:14.764 --> 00:25:24.852]  And whereas I don't get up here on air and get into Jewish conspiracies, it is a fact that the Rothschilds didn't just fund the creation of Israel.
[00:25:26.053 --> 00:25:31.937]  The Rothschilds funded the Bolshevik Revolution and what you saw done to the Tsars.
[00:25:34.179 --> 00:25:43.467]  And a large contingent of the fighters who were sent into Russia were financed by the bank that became Goldman Sachs.
[00:25:44.403 --> 00:25:45.284]  In the 1920s.
[00:25:48.826 --> 00:25:53.770]  And so, this is literal world conquest, ladies and gentlemen, that we're dealing with here.
[00:25:55.271 --> 00:26:13.625]  And Russia, after having large portions of their population exterminated, their neighbors exterminated, then Russia would get the blame for the extermination when it was the Bolsheviks, they then turn around and blame Russia yet again.
[00:26:17.546 --> 00:26:40.294]  When the globalists put the criminals in control of Russia and then turned Russia into a giant engine of evil, worldwide, while sucking the blood out of the Russian people to fund this world government, to create the fake bipolar world so they could have the counter to it that is the Anglo-American world government.
[00:26:41.434 --> 00:26:43.455]  And the globalists call it Anglo-American system.
[00:26:44.315 --> 00:26:45.776]  It's nothing to do with Anglo-Americans.
[00:26:45.856 --> 00:26:46.356]  It just means
[00:26:47.475 --> 00:26:50.896]  Part of Europe, the UK, the United States, Canada, Australia.
[00:26:52.977 --> 00:26:57.098]  And that's the dominant world power structure right now, and it's gobbling up what's left.
[00:26:58.499 --> 00:27:05.481]  And it's putting sanctions on Russia, it's attacking it on its borders, it's putting jihadis in to take out Russia's allies like Syria.
[00:27:07.702 --> 00:27:13.984]  And what's most important to understand, the people attacking America,
[00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:25.220]  The people trying to take the basic liberties of this republic are at war with any culture, period.
[00:27:27.903 --> 00:27:30.205]  And I've studied the makeup of the New World Order.
[00:27:30.365 --> 00:27:34.970]  It is eugenics, which is proto-pre-Nazi.
[00:27:37.852 --> 00:27:39.114]  It is bizarre
[00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:44.353]  World government dreams of the Rothschilds.
[00:27:44.694 --> 00:27:51.745]  It's mixed in with all sorts of just bizarre occultism and it's very anti-human.
[00:27:55.802 --> 00:28:02.865]  And is building a planetary government which the elite believe will give them life extension technologies and other things that they don't want the general public to have access to.
[00:28:03.185 --> 00:28:18.932]  So they have to get a world government in now to dictate energy, to dictate resources, and to dictate science so that they can control the arc and growth of what they call disruptive technologies that just simply unseat the monopoly power groups.
[00:28:26.172 --> 00:28:46.416]  But when I talk about chivalry saving us, I don't say our military is perfect, I don't say the Russian military is perfect, I don't say any fighting man or woman is the end all be all, but compared to the central planners who don't actually do the fighting and dying, there's a big difference between them.
[00:28:46.716 --> 00:28:54.458]  And there's been a big struggle inside our government to stop the funding of ISIS and Al Qaeda and the evil things America's doing, but here's the bottom line.
[00:28:55.444 --> 00:29:04.621]  There is an attack on Christendom happening worldwide, and America and Russia are under attack by the very same world government forces.
[00:29:06.384 --> 00:29:06.784]  Stay with us.
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:15.443]  Hamtramck, Michigan is experiencing culture shock after becoming the first majority Muslim city in the U.S.
[00:29:15.683 --> 00:29:22.327]  For example, business owners routinely advertise their products in Arabic and they can't obtain liquor licenses within 500 feet of a mosque.
[00:29:22.647 --> 00:29:27.670]  But besides this cultural shift, Hamtramck also serves as a microcosm of America's economy.
[00:29:27.911 --> 00:29:33.194]  Hamtramck was the home of a Chrysler automobile plant back during the muscle car era of the 60s and early 70s.
[00:29:33.914 --> 00:29:37.777]  Everything from Plymouth Barracudas to Dodge Chargers were built at the Hamtramck plant.
[00:29:37.937 --> 00:29:40.940]  But now the plant is closed down just like America's manufacturing base.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:41.661]  When the U.S.
[00:29:41.681 --> 00:29:45.684]  dollar was chosen as the international medium of exchange decades ago, the U.S.
[00:29:45.704 --> 00:29:47.385]  still had a strong manufacturing base.
[00:29:47.566 --> 00:29:53.070]  But now it doesn't, and the only reason why we're still able to maintain a trade deficit is due to global demand for the dollar.
[00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:58.555]  But eventually other countries will stop accepting dollars for their products because we barely manufacture anything anymore.
[00:29:58.795 --> 00:29:59.936]  When that happens, the U.S.
[00:29:59.976 --> 00:30:03.720]  economy will close down just like the Hamtramck automobile plant did so many years ago.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:08.565]  This is Kit Daniels, and visit InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv for more reports.

[00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:13.552]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:32:13.852 --> 00:32:18.774]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[00:32:18.814 --> 00:32:19.354]  I don't know.
[00:32:40.208 --> 00:32:41.148]  BrainForce is here.
[00:32:41.348 --> 00:32:43.449]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:48.291]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:32:48.531 --> 00:32:50.191]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[00:32:50.231 --> 00:32:51.732]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:32:51.832 --> 00:32:55.033]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:32:55.313 --> 00:32:57.114]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:32:57.294 --> 00:32:58.194]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:32:58.214 --> 00:32:59.194]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:32:59.394 --> 00:33:01.315]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[00:33:21.862 --> 00:33:26.945]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[00:33:27.886 --> 00:33:29.427]  Government is the problem.
[00:33:32.406 --> 00:33:39.189]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.
[00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:47.273]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[00:33:48.174 --> 00:33:49.894]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:50.315 --> 00:33:53.196]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:33:54.887 --> 00:34:00.932]  So I'm not going into a basic history lesson today because I don't have enough news.
[00:34:01.132 --> 00:34:02.493]  The news is over-the-top important.
[00:34:02.513 --> 00:34:05.275]  We're going to be covering it here in a few minutes.
[00:34:05.295 --> 00:34:14.142]  But when you look at the fact that Russia did nothing but aid this country through its entire creation,
[00:34:16.095 --> 00:34:22.359]  And even helped during the Civil War keep the Union intact against British intelligence that was trying to divide the country.
[00:34:22.379 --> 00:34:31.466]  And when you realize that the cousins of the British royal family and the Russian royal family hated each other for at least the last 200 years or so.
[00:34:33.967 --> 00:34:36.089]  And they were wiped out by design.
[00:34:36.309 --> 00:34:38.130]  And I'm not defending those royal families.
[00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:41.993]  The point was something 50 times worse was put into power.
[00:34:44.418 --> 00:34:51.602]  And so Russia has seen a major resurgence of its Orthodox Church, the Catholic Church, Protestantism, you name it.
[00:34:52.642 --> 00:35:05.749]  They're really rediscovering their roots and coming out of, well it's been 98 years since the Bolshevik Revolution, but in the last 20 or so they've been coming out of it.
[00:35:05.789 --> 00:35:12.933]  So 80 years of super hardcore social engineering, political correctness,
[00:35:14.736 --> 00:35:23.784]  All the stuff that you see happening here today is word-for-word out of NKVD, KGB handbooks.
[00:35:25.306 --> 00:35:28.669]  But you need to understand, that stuff didn't come from Russia.
[00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:34.394]  That all came from London, England, and New York City, and Washington, DC.
[00:35:34.835 --> 00:35:35.956]  Every bit of it.
[00:35:38.038 --> 00:35:40.320]  Those are Western technologies of oppression.
[00:35:43.852 --> 00:35:55.382]  Our elites are so sinister, so evil, so smart, I'll hand them that, that they literally funded Hitler, this is all on record, to build him up so he would then destroy Europe.
[00:35:56.443 --> 00:35:59.305]  He wasn't under their control, they knew what he would do.
[00:36:00.366 --> 00:36:03.428]  Just like they know what ISIS and Al-Qaeda and al-Nusra is going to do.
[00:36:06.171 --> 00:36:08.413]  And the truth is, no one is as evil
[00:36:09.765 --> 00:36:11.146]  As the people running the West.
[00:36:11.287 --> 00:36:23.057]  There is no doubt that when it comes to having satanic spiritual understanding and knowledge of how to commit just unbelievable deceptions, the West has it.
[00:36:24.959 --> 00:36:27.080]  And it's not because the West was bad.
[00:36:28.882 --> 00:36:30.524]  Where do you think evil gravitates?
[00:36:31.604 --> 00:36:34.367]  Where do you think the devil would make his main move?
[00:36:35.548 --> 00:36:36.509]  In the heart of Christendom.
[00:36:38.203 --> 00:36:54.888]  In the United Kingdom, in the United States, in the groups and people seen worldwide, whether it was by French or Japanese historians, as the most daring, the bravest, the smartest, the hardest working, the most giving, the most loving, the most charismatic.
[00:36:58.329 --> 00:37:07.092]  Once the great engine of the Renaissance fell to the New World Order, the world was in great peril.
[00:37:10.154 --> 00:37:14.956]  And the UN's own report this year admits persecution against Christians has doubled the last decade.
[00:37:15.396 --> 00:37:20.899]  There is more persecution of Christians worldwide than all other groups combined.
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.241]  So if you look at this from, oh, you know,
[00:37:27.645 --> 00:37:36.453]  Sylvester Stallone anti-Russian movies in the 70s and 80s, or if you look at it from an America versus Russia perspective, you're never going to get it.
[00:37:37.414 --> 00:37:43.980]  It is a mystery of evil, the Bible talks about, of an evil force on this planet.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.864]  The more I study it, the more my faith gets strong, because that's what it is.
[00:37:49.025 --> 00:37:52.028]  You run right into the fact this isn't human intelligence we're dealing with.
[00:37:53.729 --> 00:38:10.453]  This is a spirit that is against men, that is against women, that is against families, that is against stability, that is against honor, that is against nation states, that is against culture, that is against true creativity.
[00:38:12.394 --> 00:38:15.355]  And if you want to take down a civilization, you first take down the men.
[00:38:16.975 --> 00:38:20.756]  And we see the war against men in every sitcom and drama and movie.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:34.146]  And we see the war against women, and we see the war against our children, and we see what we've been turned into, domesticated, dumbed down shadows of what we were.
[00:38:36.427 --> 00:38:38.488]  See, Russia already hit the bottom.
[00:38:39.929 --> 00:38:41.310]  We're a long way from the bottom.
[00:38:43.351 --> 00:38:46.133]  Will we learn from Russia's peril?
[00:38:47.406 --> 00:38:51.648]  In reverse course, or will we go through things far worse than the Russians went through?
[00:38:52.108 --> 00:38:53.228]  Because let me explain something.
[00:38:53.569 --> 00:39:03.753]  Three years ago, Paul Watson wrote the article, headline, Army Manual Details Domestic Internment Camps with Re-education Centers.
[00:39:04.533 --> 00:39:13.497]  Folks, they use the term, re-education centers, that is directly out of Soviet gulag terminology.
[00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:16.150]  Army.mil.
[00:39:16.391 --> 00:39:21.193]  People still can't believe you can go to Army.mil and read about how they plan to put us in re-education camps.
[00:39:24.554 --> 00:39:36.359]  And it talks about putting the Tea Party in, and all the weird peer pressure, and then turning the camp's food off if the people themselves don't beat you to death because you're not a good liberal.
[00:39:36.539 --> 00:39:40.461]  I mean, that's what all this bullying in the schools is, all this political correctness.
[00:39:40.481 --> 00:39:42.362]  This is handbook
[00:39:43.652 --> 00:39:47.253]  Handbook stuff they did in China and Russia.
[00:39:48.674 --> 00:39:51.114]  I mean folks, they are going to have their ways with us.
[00:39:52.035 --> 00:39:53.155]  It is so unspeakable.
[00:39:54.355 --> 00:39:55.676]  The clutches we're in.
[00:39:58.656 --> 00:40:01.677]  The unbelievable clutches that we're in.
[00:40:01.737 --> 00:40:02.758]  I'm not trying to scare you.
[00:40:05.018 --> 00:40:07.179]  But we have bold criminals in charge.
[00:40:08.819 --> 00:40:10.160]  Who are waging war.
[00:40:12.196 --> 00:40:18.101]  against any strong nation state and against any country that can stand against total one world government.
[00:40:20.282 --> 00:40:28.169]  And the West is trying to push Russia into a military confrontation.
[00:40:28.189 --> 00:40:32.672]  And they're openly having discussions now about whether they'll just keep it a conventional war.
[00:40:33.052 --> 00:40:34.974]  We're going to cover this when we return in a moment, but
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:49.628]  You can't just be delusional and think, oh, you know, I'm going to be politically correct and support this big summit to save the world in Paris because I care about the planet.
[00:40:49.668 --> 00:40:50.548]  It's a feel good thing.
[00:40:50.949 --> 00:41:00.236]  It is a carbon tax to track every facet of your life and control your life and selectively cut off your energy sources, massively jacking up your prices.
[00:41:03.058 --> 00:41:06.221]  Whereas insiders are exempt worldwide.
[00:41:07.622 --> 00:41:08.463]  You understand what that means?
[00:41:10.182 --> 00:41:11.183]  Monopoly takeover.
[00:41:13.344 --> 00:41:15.646]  We've got all these huge things happening right now.
[00:41:18.168 --> 00:41:25.873]  And there is a war to take down humanity taking place right now and we're all under attack.
[00:41:26.614 --> 00:41:29.816]  You think the globalists hate the Russians because they have their own weapons that are independent?
[00:41:29.856 --> 00:41:31.838]  They hate Americans five times worse.
[00:41:34.239 --> 00:41:36.981]  And here are these two regions, these two countries that should be
[00:41:38.038 --> 00:41:50.949]  Collaborating because of all the scientific and technological advances and instead, like fools, were played off against each other over and over and over again by the cold-blooded New World Order.
[00:41:52.170 --> 00:42:00.497]  If the men of this country would just get as informed as they are about fantasy football as they should be about geopolitics, we wouldn't be in this position.
[00:42:04.991 --> 00:42:10.275]  We're going to come back and break down the serious World War III implications that even mainstream media is calling it that.
[00:42:10.975 --> 00:42:18.160]  Briefly, we extended Black Friday, as I told you we would do Friday, through tonight at midnight at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.942]  Your purchase of the products does make everything we do here possible.
[00:42:21.582 --> 00:42:27.246]  We have a 2-ounce, super high-quality, coiled silver, 30 parts per million, Silver Bullets, the brand name, at InfoWarsLive.com, $9.95.

[00:42:35.535 --> 00:42:38.516]  It's the same stuff that's in Whole Foods, you name it, private label by us.
[00:42:39.737 --> 00:42:41.577]  $9.95 or $24.95, your choice.
[00:42:42.058 --> 00:42:43.378]  And you get to support the InfoWar.

[00:42:53.843 --> 00:42:55.344]  This whole operation possible.

[00:43:10.017 --> 00:43:11.378]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:43:11.658 --> 00:43:12.959]  You can't survive without it.
[00:43:13.139 --> 00:43:14.040]  But where do you get it?

[00:47:49.347 --> 00:47:56.873]  Every time we play that, I see emails or comments going, man, who is that doing King of the Hill voices?
[00:47:56.893 --> 00:47:58.354]  They sound just like Mike Judge.
[00:47:58.394 --> 00:47:59.855]  Well, that is Mike Judge.
[00:48:00.315 --> 00:48:01.576]  That's why it sounds like Mike Judge.
[00:48:02.617 --> 00:48:03.417]  Just throwing that out there.
[00:48:03.437 --> 00:48:04.678]  Another Patriot fully awake.
[00:48:04.698 --> 00:48:05.459]  Knows what's going on.
[00:48:05.499 --> 00:48:06.580]  Has like 180 IQ.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:07.720]  Helped design the F-18.
[00:48:09.611 --> 00:48:13.834]  But also is one hell of a cartoonist and voiceover expert.
[00:48:13.854 --> 00:48:19.659]  Alright, I'm not going to go off into that, it's just there are a lot of great patriots out there across the world, a lot of great artists that know the truth.
[00:48:22.701 --> 00:48:38.394]  Let me now get into the situation in Russia, then I'll cover the Planned Parenthood situation and the big climate conference and the rest of it and how it all ties together, but I shot a video titled Total Emergency Alert Part 3, World War 3.
[00:48:40.043 --> 00:48:43.266]  And that's because it's the third one I've done in about six months.
[00:48:44.847 --> 00:48:48.290]  I did one six months ago, one about two months ago, and then one yesterday.
[00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:49.691]  It's a 10-minute video.
[00:48:49.731 --> 00:48:51.152]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:48:52.553 --> 00:48:54.995]  We are hurtling towards the precipice of full-scale war.
[00:48:56.456 --> 00:49:03.042]  And I showed CIA analysts saying it, and the Washington Post saying it, and the Russians saying it, and show historical evidence.
[00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:10.694]  But remember, I kept telling you that the elites are evacuating out of the West.
[00:49:11.014 --> 00:49:17.158]  They're moving to armored facilities, redoubts, fortresses in rural areas around the world.
[00:49:20.621 --> 00:49:28.467]  They're also building armored redoubts in places like the mountains in Missouri, in places, the Ozarks.
[00:49:30.848 --> 00:49:31.449]  They're digging in.
[00:49:33.442 --> 00:49:42.667]  Now, that doesn't mean we're going to have a big war, but there's massive preparations going on, and I've been saying, building up into December and on into next year.
[00:49:43.668 --> 00:49:51.312]  Major geopolitical jockeying, countries lining up, the same stuff we saw before World War I, World War II, Korean War, you name it.
[00:49:52.513 --> 00:50:00.037]  And if you just look it up, there are literally hundreds of analysts, historians, geostrategists, Pat Buchanan.
[00:50:01.187 --> 00:50:06.791]  Saying we're ripe for major escalations of war with nuclear powers.
[00:50:10.554 --> 00:50:13.316]  One of Pat Buchanan's new articles again is stumbling to war with Russia.
[00:50:14.977 --> 00:50:19.840]  So when I come out and say we're moving towards World War III, I'm not saying we're going to have a new world war.
[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:21.822]  I'm saying the ingredients are there.
[00:50:23.223 --> 00:50:26.345]  It's like putting two pit bulls in a cage together.
[00:50:26.365 --> 00:50:27.826]  You know, a fight's going to start.
[00:50:34.755 --> 00:50:35.616]  And here are the headlines.
[00:50:35.696 --> 00:50:36.176]  CNN.
[00:50:36.256 --> 00:50:37.738]  How is this not World War III?
[00:50:39.919 --> 00:50:41.641]  Here is the New York Times.
[00:50:41.761 --> 00:50:43.002]  World War III is the headline.
[00:50:43.342 --> 00:50:44.383]  Former CIA operative.
[00:50:44.423 --> 00:50:45.745]  Get ready for World War III.
[00:50:47.846 --> 00:50:49.488]  Saying that it's out of control.
[00:50:49.608 --> 00:50:51.329]  The worst case scenario.
[00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:54.232]  Escalations with Russia with the shoot down of their aircraft.
[00:50:54.952 --> 00:50:55.773]  It goes on and on.
[00:50:56.494 --> 00:50:57.174]  Here's another headline.
[00:50:57.194 --> 00:50:58.496]  Has World War III already started?
[00:51:02.093 --> 00:51:25.142]  Mainstream media now finally gets it, but I'm just pointing out we weren't fear-mongering when we said six months ago that many geopolitical analysts believe and elites are making moves to protect themselves during a world financial crisis, regional wars, even limited nuclear war, if this continues.
[00:51:25.462 --> 00:51:26.222]  I mean, it's simple.
[00:51:26.382 --> 00:51:29.983]  Russia is there bombing ISIS and Al-Qaeda out of Turkey and Saudi Arabia.
[00:51:30.003 --> 00:51:31.244]  The West is all backing it.
[00:51:32.346 --> 00:51:35.967]  They're shooting down Russian aircraft, blowing up their rescue helicopters.
[00:51:40.729 --> 00:51:56.274]  And then the Turkish air gun, their president, prime minister, came out on Friday and said, listen, you're saying you developed these S-400 missiles that'll shoot down our planes in seconds.
[00:51:56.915 --> 00:51:59.456]  If we come into your space, we're going to continue coming in.
[00:51:59.496 --> 00:52:00.356]  They come in every day.
[00:52:01.305 --> 00:52:03.146]  They said, we're allowed to come into Syria.
[00:52:03.586 --> 00:52:05.868]  You're not allowed to even fly to the border of Turkey.
[00:52:07.609 --> 00:52:08.929]  People think that's hypocrisy.
[00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:10.470]  No, it's all about arrogance.
[00:52:12.552 --> 00:52:18.995]  And believe me, the Russians might have been in their airspace for like nine seconds.
[00:52:19.556 --> 00:52:25.879]  The only way they could be waiting on them was the flight plan filed with NATO and the United States and CENTCOM.
[00:52:29.241 --> 00:52:29.982]  Now let's be clear.
[00:52:32.042 --> 00:52:45.835]  We have a bunch of politicians that have never been in the military, never commanded troops, and as dangerous as it is to have generals in charge of war, it's even more dangerous to have the politicians in charge of it.
[00:52:49.119 --> 00:52:50.260]  And it's been our military.
[00:52:51.946 --> 00:53:00.811]  In the last several years, that has gone to Congress behind the scenes, gone to the President, the White House, and said, we're not backing Al-Qaeda and all these groups in Syria.
[00:53:00.831 --> 00:53:01.171]  We're not.
[00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:01.732]  Stop it.
[00:53:02.252 --> 00:53:03.352]  We're losing moral high ground.
[00:53:03.372 --> 00:53:04.293]  This is really bad.
[00:53:04.573 --> 00:53:07.775]  They're murdering non-radical Muslims and Christians by the hundreds of thousands.
[00:53:08.215 --> 00:53:09.516]  Our own military is freaking out.
[00:53:09.596 --> 00:53:12.898]  You cannot do this because our military is made up of mainly Christians.
[00:53:15.159 --> 00:53:16.340]  And they're not going to be part of this.
[00:53:17.509 --> 00:53:22.414]  And so Christians have looked at this and understand that Russia is in a good, just war.
[00:53:24.276 --> 00:53:31.744]  And the United States is run by the same criminals that sell baby parts on the world market and snuff films and sex slavery.
[00:53:31.904 --> 00:53:37.189]  I mean, we're run by international mafias that are above the law through the UN, the IMF and World Bank.
[00:53:42.515 --> 00:53:52.043]  Our own military, last year, as reported by Fox News after we broke it, with a straight face, said, the Founding Fathers are not welcome in today's military.
[00:53:52.103 --> 00:53:54.845]  Don't be part of the Tea Party or a Christian or you may be court-martialed.
[00:53:54.865 --> 00:54:00.029]  I mean, do you realize the magnitude of saying you may be court-martialed if you go to evangelical church?
[00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:02.811]  People say that's over the top tyranny.
[00:54:02.831 --> 00:54:03.652]  You have religious freedom.
[00:54:04.172 --> 00:54:04.853]  That's the whole point.
[00:54:04.893 --> 00:54:05.994]  They're getting us ready.
[00:54:07.654 --> 00:54:09.695]  They're saying we're going to forcibly inoculate your kids.
[00:54:10.216 --> 00:54:12.677]  We're going to say, you know, you can't give money to the Tea Party.
[00:54:12.978 --> 00:54:14.979]  We're going to arrest Dinesh D'Souza, the filmmaker.
[00:54:15.179 --> 00:54:15.820]  He's on tomorrow.
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:17.841]  We're going to go after Matt Drudge.
[00:54:17.861 --> 00:54:18.862]  We're going to go after Infowars.
[00:54:20.783 --> 00:54:24.786]  We're going to take people's free speech, and if you don't like it, that's just the way it is.
[00:54:24.866 --> 00:54:25.746]  Sit down and shut up.
[00:54:27.167 --> 00:54:29.629]  They have banned demonstrations in Germany and France.
[00:54:33.291 --> 00:54:33.992]  Tyranny is here.
[00:54:35.816 --> 00:54:50.059]  And for all of Russia's problems, Russia would not completely capitulate to suicide, to letting in unlimited radical Muslim immigrants, to putting taxes on people trying to have kids, to shutting down their society.
[00:54:50.399 --> 00:54:51.959]  Russia doesn't forcibly inoculate.
[00:54:52.299 --> 00:54:53.620]  Russia doesn't sell baby parts.
[00:54:58.681 --> 00:55:05.322]  And it's not that Russia is so good, it's that the people that run us are so bad and practice evil upon us
[00:55:06.741 --> 00:55:08.742]  In an attempt to get us to simply accept it.
[00:55:10.963 --> 00:55:11.763]  Look at these headlines.
[00:55:11.883 --> 00:55:15.145]  Putin citing national security signs Turkey's sanctions decree.
[00:55:16.305 --> 00:55:26.330]  You see how fast this escalates where the missiles get fired now at the Turkish aircraft and then Turkey responds and NATO responds and there you are.
[00:55:31.377 --> 00:55:34.280]  Putin citing national security signs Turkey's sanctions decree.
[00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:41.807]  Putin accuses Obama of leaking flight details to Turkey after Russia releases video of S-400 SAM deployment in Syria.
[00:55:43.248 --> 00:55:51.516]  Turkey's air gun warns Russia not to play with fire and says we will shoot down your aircraft and by the way we'll fly over Syria, we'll do whatever we want.
[00:55:52.717 --> 00:55:55.980]  Russia fully mobilized strikes Turkish targets in Syria.
[00:55:58.286 --> 00:56:01.831]  Russia deploys TOW missile-resistant T-90 tank in Aleppo.
[00:56:06.176 --> 00:56:10.722]  Turkish-supported jihadist group shells Russian base in Syria.
[00:56:10.842 --> 00:56:13.405]  I mean, Turkey's already in a war with Russia.
[00:56:13.546 --> 00:56:16.069]  They've had, by the way, ten wars with them, lost nine of them.
[00:56:20.197 --> 00:56:28.182]  So, that's what's going on while the average man watches football today and acts tough in front of his wife and, you know, grunts in front of his neighbor and feels powerful.
[00:56:28.722 --> 00:56:30.583]  A real man would know about how the world works.
[00:56:30.623 --> 00:56:31.404]  He'd be involved.
[00:56:31.444 --> 00:56:33.265]  He'd be standing up for justice.
[00:56:33.285 --> 00:56:34.525]  He'd be standing up for Christians.
[00:56:34.886 --> 00:56:36.166]  He'd be standing up for free speech.
[00:56:36.607 --> 00:56:38.067]  He'd be standing up for the Second Amendment.
[00:56:39.128 --> 00:56:41.129]  But see, men think that's not what men do.
[00:56:41.189 --> 00:56:44.371]  Men just go make money and try to have as much fun as they can.
[00:56:46.632 --> 00:56:47.433]  That's why you're not a man.
[00:56:49.155 --> 00:56:49.855]  It's why you're not happy.
[00:56:49.875 --> 00:56:50.856]  It's why you're not fulfilled.
[00:56:51.536 --> 00:56:52.297]  It's why you're a slave.
[00:56:53.637 --> 00:56:56.539]  I'm talking to people that just tuned in for the first time and think this is all cute and funny.
[00:56:57.039 --> 00:56:59.601]  See, you don't see it as your place to be involved or informed.
[00:57:01.261 --> 00:57:01.822]  So you're dead.
[00:57:02.322 --> 00:57:02.662]  Already.
[00:57:04.463 --> 00:57:08.285]  Meanwhile, coming up, Prince Charles, climate change, a cause for war.
[00:57:08.345 --> 00:57:16.970]  We mentioned this last week because now Bernie Sanders has come out following the orders of the oligarch, of the monarch.
[00:57:19.068 --> 00:57:26.638]  And it's saying, oh yes, the problems in Syria and everything aren't because the West invaded the country and broke it all down and did all this and killed hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:57:27.199 --> 00:57:28.660]  No, no, it's because climate change...
[00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:36.433]  And now they're warning that giant flying boulders may rain from the sky if we don't pay Al Gore and the UN for every human action we take.
[00:57:36.473 --> 00:57:37.293]  I mean, what a joke.
[00:57:37.673 --> 00:57:41.095]  Their propaganda is so dumbed down to a third grade level.
[00:57:41.915 --> 00:57:47.578]  And you've got all these fake liberals who are really totalitarians who really want to be chomped by all this.
[00:57:47.658 --> 00:57:49.478]  It's totally sickening.
[00:57:49.558 --> 00:57:52.860]  The second hour is only 70 seconds away when we go to break.
[00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:54.441]  Please tell your friends to tell them to tune in.
[00:57:54.721 --> 00:57:56.501]  We're talking about the future of the world right now.
[00:57:56.541 --> 00:57:57.462]  It couldn't be more important.
[00:57:59.813 --> 00:58:03.014]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:58:03.334 --> 00:58:11.335]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:58:11.575 --> 00:58:16.577]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:58:16.997 --> 00:58:19.277]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:59:49.838 --> 00:59:50.819]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:13.573 --> 01:00:19.594]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:20.215 --> 01:00:23.255]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:25.056 --> 01:00:26.076]  Here's the bottom line.
[01:00:26.396 --> 01:00:30.277]  America and Europe, the UK, have fallen to globalists.
[01:00:31.597 --> 01:00:36.779]  They're using us to conquer the world while impoverishing us for social control in the future.
[01:00:39.419 --> 01:00:42.800]  We have been deliberately emasculated.
[01:00:45.296 --> 01:00:46.397]  Using chemical warfare.
[01:00:46.797 --> 01:00:49.039]  Bisphenol A, the estrogen mimickers.
[01:00:51.321 --> 01:00:53.763]  Our women have the highest rates of breast cancer because of it.
[01:00:54.004 --> 01:00:57.727]  Men have the highest rates here in the United States of prostate cancer because of it.
[01:00:58.367 --> 01:01:01.190]  Those are simply side effects of the chemical warfare program.
[01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:05.274]  So you can look at America and be angry at folks.
[01:01:05.434 --> 01:01:10.178]  They were eased in, they were mesmerized, they were put under a spell, and they were hit with chemical weapons.
[01:01:14.284 --> 01:01:15.885]  You are living in a science fiction movie.
[01:01:16.065 --> 01:01:16.805]  This is all real.
[01:01:20.146 --> 01:01:22.347]  And it's only going to get more interesting from here on out.
[01:01:23.648 --> 01:01:33.051]  The good news is there are countries and nations and individuals all over the world that realize that the jackboot of the New World Order is pure tyranny and they're not going along with it.
[01:01:34.772 --> 01:01:40.734]  That said, over a hundred billion dollars conservatively has been spent in the last thirty years pushing man-made global warming.
[01:01:41.274 --> 01:01:42.695]  Now it's man-made climate change.
[01:01:42.835 --> 01:01:43.515]  Anthropogenic.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.922]  And they're having the most important world government summit ever.
[01:01:47.962 --> 01:01:51.085]  Lord Mox will be on with us next week from the conference in Paris.
[01:01:53.446 --> 01:01:54.427]  Reporting for InfoWars.
[01:01:56.389 --> 01:01:56.789]  And others.
[01:01:59.291 --> 01:02:09.099]  And they are just setting up a world court, world tribunal, world taxes, world regulations, all through this and saying they're going to arrest people that criticize this fraud.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.543]  They have banned any demonstrations in France or Germany.
[01:02:16.052 --> 01:02:16.812]  Look at this headline.
[01:02:16.892 --> 01:02:19.593]  Paris attack expected to make climate deal more likely.
[01:02:19.893 --> 01:02:20.934]  That's what the French government says.
[01:02:21.034 --> 01:02:21.934]  Oh, bring everyone together!
[01:02:22.294 --> 01:02:24.395]  Because, again, the attack happened because of climate change.
[01:02:24.415 --> 01:02:29.397]  I thought it was because they opened the borders up and brought in Saudi Arabian jihadis and Chechen jihadis.
[01:02:29.537 --> 01:02:29.997]  Oh, no!
[01:02:30.698 --> 01:02:41.722]  No, it didn't come from the socialists bringing them in to blow stuff up so they could ban nationalist demonstrations and arrest the leader of the conservative party that just won elections across France.
[01:02:43.883 --> 01:02:44.683]  Oh, no, I forgot.
[01:02:47.253 --> 01:02:48.774]  It was the fault of climate change.
[01:02:48.794 --> 01:02:49.795]  I mean, I'm reading this stuff.
[01:02:50.195 --> 01:02:53.957]  Another danger of climate change, giant flying boulders.
[01:02:53.997 --> 01:02:58.400]  They just tell school kids, Washington Post, that giant boulders will fall on your head.
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:04.424]  I mean, it's like saying, you know, like primitive pygmies, you know, do what I say or the goblin's gonna come eat you.
[01:03:04.504 --> 01:03:10.028]  I mean, it is just the most idiotic, moron garbage I have ever seen in my life.
[01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:13.891]  California freezes.
[01:03:15.168 --> 01:03:17.349]  Minus 11 in Sierra and snow and ice.
[01:03:22.432 --> 01:03:25.333]  Temp data finding biggest science scandal ever.
[01:03:25.353 --> 01:03:29.715]  The world's been cooling for 18 years, but they've caught major governments fixing the numbers.
[01:03:29.735 --> 01:03:30.856]  Well, we have the emails.
[01:03:31.296 --> 01:03:32.056]  Hide the decline.
[01:03:32.677 --> 01:03:39.780]  Oh, again, it was Russian hackers got in and got the British emails managing over 400 universities and the fraud.
[01:03:41.341 --> 01:03:43.822]  Hiding the decline from the United States to Australia.
[01:03:48.513 --> 01:03:48.973]  Amazing.
[01:03:49.934 --> 01:03:54.918]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip of Bernie Sanders parroting what Prince Charles said last week.
[01:03:54.999 --> 01:04:02.845]  Oh, and a monarch and then the socialist who protects the private Federal Reserve, but criticizes it, but protects it when he actually votes.
[01:04:03.366 --> 01:04:07.709]  Bernie Sanders says, again, the terrorists are attacking because of climate change.
[01:04:08.991 --> 01:04:09.431]  Here we go.
[01:04:09.932 --> 01:04:13.795]  In the previous debate, you said the greatest threat to national security was climate change.
[01:04:13.835 --> 01:04:14.615]  Do you still believe that?
[01:04:14.935 --> 01:04:15.476]  Absolutely.
[01:04:15.656 --> 01:04:18.818]  In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.
[01:04:19.419 --> 01:04:24.122]  And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see countries all over the world.
[01:04:24.242 --> 01:04:25.723]  This is what the CIA says.
[01:04:26.624 --> 01:04:31.067]  They're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops.
[01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:33.629]  And you're going to see all kinds of international conflict.
[01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:36.932]  Of course, international terrorism is a major issue.
[01:04:39.494 --> 01:04:47.223]  They know that seven years ago when the price of food became about 50% of third world nations cost that that causes civil insurrection.
[01:04:48.264 --> 01:04:50.346]  And it's being done because of monetary policies.
[01:04:50.666 --> 01:04:52.889]  We have enough food in the US to feed the whole world.
[01:04:52.929 --> 01:04:54.351]  They just pay farmers not to produce.
[01:04:54.651 --> 01:04:56.473]  It's a load of horse manure.
[01:04:58.154 --> 01:05:05.966]  And just to watch that bucket of crap acting like he is some type of patriot and cares about poor people when he's a giant, filthy parasite.
[01:05:06.227 --> 01:05:08.149]  Bernie Sanders is a human maggot.
[01:05:11.016 --> 01:05:21.646]  The latest rich person who lives a life of luxury in one of their many houses, travels in private jets, but is telling you that you have to cut out every modern convenience in your life, is the King of Sweden.
[01:05:21.686 --> 01:05:22.227]  That's right.
[01:05:22.487 --> 01:05:32.897]  King Carl Gustaf, who has a reputation of being quite a ladies' man, has now called for a ban on bass, and admits he is ashamed to run one after realizing how much energy they use.
[01:05:33.057 --> 01:05:34.578]  I am laughing while I'm reading this.
[01:05:34.598 --> 01:05:35.079]  That is right.
[01:05:35.219 --> 01:05:39.405]  To show how eco-friendly he is, he also drives a hybrid car.
[01:05:39.685 --> 01:05:42.489]  And he's using low-energy light bulbs.
[01:05:42.769 --> 01:05:44.071]  Now that's where it gets absurd.
[01:05:44.291 --> 01:05:50.300]  Back in Canada, anyone who admits carbon will pay, Alberta says, as it releases tough climate change policies.
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:55.724]  Which includes a mandate that two-thirds of coal-fired electricity generation be replaced with renewables by 2030.
[01:05:56.144 --> 01:05:59.787]  The Guardian is reporting, no pets, no kids, no flights.
[01:05:59.867 --> 01:06:02.409]  How readers are reducing their carbon footprint.
[01:06:02.529 --> 01:06:06.112]  Yes, in fact, there are some people out there that actually believe this garbage.
[01:06:06.332 --> 01:06:08.714]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:06:08.914 --> 01:06:09.595]  Thanks for watching.
[01:06:29.958 --> 01:06:31.400]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:32.781]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:37.845]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:40.668 --> 01:06:51.218]  Coming up, Obama on the Colorado Planned Parenthood shooting by a man that said he had no political affiliation, identified himself as a woman.
[01:06:53.988 --> 01:06:58.949]  We're now told it's the fault of gun owners, and Obama has said, quote, enough is enough.
[01:06:58.989 --> 01:07:01.730]  That's the CNN headline, and it's coming for our guns.
[01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:14.333]  Meanwhile, Paris attack expected to make climate deal more likely, as Prince Charles, Bernie Sanders, President Hollande, and others say, climate change made the jihadis run around and murder everybody.
[01:07:14.393 --> 01:07:21.635]  Not the open borders, not the advertisements of freebies, not the West funding them to go in and kill hundreds of thousands of Christians.
[01:07:22.095 --> 01:07:22.315]  No!
[01:07:24.218 --> 01:07:25.779]  No, the man on the moon did it.
[01:07:28.001 --> 01:07:29.242]  The man on the moon did it.
[01:07:30.342 --> 01:07:43.312]  Meanwhile, it doesn't matter if Le Pen is set, who got third place in the last election, is in polls as the leader in elections in a couple of years.
[01:07:45.879 --> 01:07:47.760]  Oh, the feminists don't care if she's a smart woman.
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:50.562]  They don't care because she's a libertarian conservative, a nationalist.
[01:07:51.202 --> 01:07:53.784]  And they don't want Le Pen in, so they just arrested her a month ago.
[01:07:54.264 --> 01:08:02.329]  She's facing a year in prison for saying there's an Islamic invasion being carried out by the socialists to divide and conquer and end the national identity of France.
[01:08:02.349 --> 01:08:04.730]  I mean, what she said was, the sky is blue.
[01:08:07.852 --> 01:08:08.952]  And they arrested her.
[01:08:10.513 --> 01:08:11.654]  We had a guest on Friday.
[01:08:15.134 --> 01:08:19.957]  For a artist that simply said, we have a right to free speech in Canada and put up posters.
[01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:26.060]  And feminists came and tore him down and they arrested him and he's facing, what is it, five years in prison?
[01:08:28.301 --> 01:08:35.445]  And people say, well, why didn't they pick something hateful or mean at least to try to put somebody in jail even though there's really not a law that would be applicable?
[01:08:35.885 --> 01:08:38.747]  Because they want it to be arrest someone for nothing.
[01:08:39.667 --> 01:08:41.308]  They want to set that precedent.
[01:08:41.348 --> 01:08:42.829]  This is totalitarianism.
[01:08:43.549 --> 01:08:44.490]  It's here, folks.
[01:08:47.557 --> 01:08:48.638]  So that's all coming up.
[01:08:50.039 --> 01:08:57.866]  But Joel Skousen is a former Marine Corps officer, naval aviator from Vietnam.
[01:08:58.386 --> 01:09:05.492]  His uncle, of course, was Cleon Skousen, wrote the seminal book, The Naked Communist, explaining how ultra-rich elites were funding communism.
[01:09:05.512 --> 01:09:08.054]  And of course, that's all been admitted and confirmed now.
[01:09:10.216 --> 01:09:14.439]  The Russians have released the annals that McCarthy was right about everything.
[01:09:15.236 --> 01:09:16.676]  When he came out and said the U.S.
[01:09:16.716 --> 01:09:19.717]  military was funding communism worldwide, that's when they shut him down.
[01:09:19.737 --> 01:09:25.819]  It wasn't that our military was bad, but the top, the State Department, was funding the Russians the whole time.
[01:09:27.959 --> 01:09:33.401]  Just like my grandfather in a B-17 wasn't allowed to bomb Ford factories in Germany.
[01:09:35.021 --> 01:09:35.981]  They'd get mad about that.
[01:09:36.962 --> 01:09:37.882]  They were building tanks.
[01:09:39.482 --> 01:09:40.323]  That's how this works.
[01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:42.085]  The robber barons get to make money on both sides.
[01:09:42.625 --> 01:09:44.307]  So Joel Scouse is a political scientist.
[01:09:44.867 --> 01:09:52.374]  He's also the best-selling author of multiple books on survival and safe homes and strategic relocation.
[01:09:52.415 --> 01:09:53.355]  We made a film with him.
[01:09:54.096 --> 01:09:54.857]  The film's available.
[01:09:54.877 --> 01:09:56.358]  Strategic Relocation.
[01:09:56.398 --> 01:09:59.782]  The film with the book at InfoWarsTore.com, I should add.
[01:10:01.357 --> 01:10:05.060]  And he's also headed up some of the largest conservative organizations in the country.
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.141]  I'm not going to get into all of that.
[01:10:07.201 --> 01:10:08.743]  He's the editor of World Affairs Brief.
[01:10:09.223 --> 01:10:13.946]  We're going to go to break here in a few minutes, Joel, and I'm going to try to really go over a lot of ground with you today.
[01:10:15.282 --> 01:10:23.704]  I put out videos, as you know, the last six months saying clearly Russia entering could escalate if Turkey or someone else shoots down their aircraft, or Israelis do.
[01:10:23.744 --> 01:10:32.707]  You were on a few months ago and said if they were to shoot down Russian aircraft, then they're going to move in S-400 generation SAM missiles that basically nothing can stop.
[01:10:33.107 --> 01:10:36.468]  I hear the Naval Aviator, correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:10:37.288 --> 01:10:41.452]  And that now Russia is saying that if any Turkish planes come in, they're going to shoot those down.
[01:10:42.092 --> 01:10:46.596]  And Turkey's saying, Irgun's saying, no, we're allowed to come into your space, you just can't come into ours.
[01:10:46.656 --> 01:10:47.617]  That's an actual quote.
[01:10:48.197 --> 01:10:51.020]  Obviously, I think NATO's letting them do this as a test.
[01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:52.641]  It's incredibly reckless.
[01:10:52.701 --> 01:10:53.622]  Maybe you disagree.
[01:10:54.202 --> 01:10:56.564]  But I've said this could lead, obviously, to a world war.
[01:10:57.105 --> 01:10:58.306]  You've been talking for decades.
[01:10:58.326 --> 01:11:01.648]  They want to lure the Russians or the Chinese into a first strike down the road.
[01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:12.092]  And you admitted you were surprised at the escalation we've now seen in Syria with the Russians entering in such a bold fashion two months ago.
[01:11:12.472 --> 01:11:19.795]  Could the timetable be moved forward for World War 4, as the Pentagon calls it, World War 3 being the Cold War?
[01:11:20.455 --> 01:11:25.397]  Joel Skousen, am I wrong in saying that this is one of the most dangerous times in world history?
[01:11:27.467 --> 01:11:31.529]  Well, clearly it's a dangerous time, but I do think it's still premature.
[01:11:31.649 --> 01:11:34.211]  I don't think the time schedule has been moved up.
[01:11:34.671 --> 01:11:41.015]  I think if you look very carefully at what's happened in the skirmishes, Russia isn't anywhere near ready to provoke anything.
[01:11:41.475 --> 01:11:47.698]  They are threatening, and in fact, Turkey has just recently said, I guess, you know, we won't cross the border now into Syria.
[01:11:48.299 --> 01:11:50.520]  And they've stopped their incursions into Greece, too.
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:51.701]  So everybody's holding back.
[01:11:52.621 --> 01:11:57.604]  Look, I think very clearly, as I pointed out in Friday's World Affairs Brief, the U.S.
[01:11:57.764 --> 01:12:09.730]  induced Turkey to do this specifically in order to get Russia to bring in their top-of-the-line ECM, or electronic countermeasures, and their S-400s and the S-300s.
[01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:10.891]  The war game?
[01:12:12.196 --> 01:12:14.699]  So they can war game it, they can eavesdrop on it.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:24.853]  You know, the Russians have been eavesdropping on our military operations for years, Desert Storm and Enduring Freedom, and picking up all our electronic signatures, developing countermeasures.
[01:12:25.233 --> 01:12:25.574]  The U.S.
[01:12:25.594 --> 01:12:26.795]  has no knowledge.
[01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:30.499]  Of what the Russians have developed and that's what they're going to get out of this.
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:34.182]  The Russians are going to bring in fighter cover.
[01:12:34.282 --> 01:12:39.046]  They're doing it today on all the sorties and they're going to be putting out electronic signatures.
[01:12:39.086 --> 01:12:39.446]  The U.S.
[01:12:39.506 --> 01:12:41.028]  is eavesdropping on all that stuff.
[01:12:41.048 --> 01:12:42.669]  This is a goldmine for the U.S.
[01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:44.811]  military intelligence community.
[01:12:46.562 --> 01:12:58.985]  So they've manipulated Russia basically into escalating things, but as you said a month ago on the show, or two months ago, it still is a big bold move for the Russians to come into Syria with the moral high ground against Al Qaeda.
[01:12:59.813 --> 01:13:01.795]  Yeah, and they're still doing the job.
[01:13:01.835 --> 01:13:04.917]  I mean, they're bombing convoys just after they come across the border.
[01:13:06.038 --> 01:13:09.621]  And they're not stopping, they're just being more careful not to get that close to the border.
[01:13:10.482 --> 01:13:11.723]  But they put the U.S.
[01:13:11.783 --> 01:13:22.932]  and Turkey on... I mean, so much information, Alex, has come out in the past week about Turkey funding these rebels and moving supplies in the name of humanitarians.
[01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:34.333]  Yeah, hiding oil and then marketing the oil through Bilal Erdogan, the president's son, who owns a major shipping and transportation company.
[01:13:34.433 --> 01:13:37.234]  You have to wonder how did he get the money to get into that.
[01:13:37.274 --> 01:13:39.135]  It was obviously government money, probably.
[01:13:39.675 --> 01:13:42.716]  But, you know, the Russians are really playing this game well.
[01:13:42.736 --> 01:13:47.377]  They're saying, look, if these are humanitarian convoys coming, then they would be declared as such.
[01:13:47.437 --> 01:13:49.158]  If they're not declared, we're going to hit them.
[01:13:49.598 --> 01:13:50.218]  And they are.
[01:13:50.418 --> 01:13:52.659]  And ISIS is running out of material fast.
[01:13:53.419 --> 01:13:56.780]  So this was, that's what Turkey admits, a desperate move.
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:01.762]  A week before the shoot down, they told them, stop targeting ISIS or we're going to escalate.
[01:14:01.802 --> 01:14:09.745]  And I guess now that they've shot down the aircraft, it does seem like, with the announcement that NATO told Turkey to close the border today.
[01:14:10.325 --> 01:14:13.686]  So do you think that's a real closure or just more distractions?
[01:14:14.594 --> 01:14:16.275]  No, no, it can't be a real closure.
[01:14:16.776 --> 01:14:20.878]  They've really got to revamp their position, and this is what the Russians have been doing by intervening.
[01:14:20.898 --> 01:14:22.219]  They've embarrassed the U.S.
[01:14:22.259 --> 01:14:22.399]  now.
[01:14:22.439 --> 01:14:23.580]  They're embarrassing Turkey.
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:26.102]  In fact, they've hit Turkey hard economically.
[01:14:26.562 --> 01:14:32.706]  Almost 50% of Turkish tourism outside of Istanbul itself is Russian tourists.
[01:14:33.006 --> 01:14:34.107]  That's all been cut off now.
[01:14:34.447 --> 01:14:37.710]  All their construction contracts... They're cutting off their food exports.
[01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.970]  That's right.
[01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:44.374]  And they haven't cut off the gas imports from Russian gas that, you know, runs Turkey.
[01:14:44.514 --> 01:14:46.995]  But that's the next big shoe to fall on this.
[01:14:47.375 --> 01:14:55.120]  But clearly the globalists have had to sacrifice in this because they know the Russians are watching everything coming across the border.
[01:14:55.180 --> 01:15:02.344]  I think they're going to have to stop the obvious smuggling, lest it get found out even more definitively now.
[01:15:02.364 --> 01:15:04.246]  Well, that's my next point.
[01:15:04.326 --> 01:15:07.648]  Isn't it a huge victory, though, that suddenly all over CNN, all over Fox,
[01:15:08.448 --> 01:15:11.330]  Everywhere, they're talking about stuff we were discussing a year ago.
[01:15:11.791 --> 01:15:13.092]  This is a big victory, isn't it?
[01:15:13.212 --> 01:15:18.516]  That the military saying no to backing Al Qaeda two years ago, what you've done, so many others.
[01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:21.299]  We're not bragging, but I'm saying we are having some positive moves.
[01:15:21.739 --> 01:15:23.640]  This is forcing a real open debate.
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:26.363]  That has got to upset the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:15:27.228 --> 01:15:28.989]  It has indeed, Alex.
[01:15:29.009 --> 01:15:33.070]  You've done a great job, you know, in exposing this and it is hitting home.
[01:15:33.810 --> 01:15:42.013]  I mean, you can't, I know you can believe, but there's so many international newspapers publishing material backing the Turkey supplying ISIS.
[01:15:42.073 --> 01:15:47.415]  Turkey is looking like the bad guy now and NATO is scrambling because they really got egg on their face.
[01:15:47.455 --> 01:15:55.478]  But remember, this sacrifice was done because the US desperately needed to get the Russians into a combat situation where they could eavesdrop
[01:15:55.558 --> 01:15:56.359]  No, you predicted it.
[01:15:56.399 --> 01:16:03.309]  You said two months ago, if we find the clip, they want to move in the S-400s to track them and trace them.
[01:16:03.329 --> 01:16:05.412]  Let's talk about those missiles with an expert.
[01:16:05.853 --> 01:16:07.975]  Marine Corps fighter pilot, Phil Skousen.
[01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:11.139]  I want more candy!
[01:16:11.159 --> 01:16:11.759]  I want more cookies!
[01:16:11.799 --> 01:16:12.600]  Why, why, why?
[01:16:39.858 --> 01:16:40.638]  I think so.
[01:17:09.728 --> 01:17:19.576]  Most of the InfoWars radio listening audience is aware of the high-quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at htfirearms.com.

[01:18:34.304 --> 01:18:36.626]  Extracted directly from the wild herb.

[01:18:43.392 --> 01:18:49.257]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[01:18:49.617 --> 01:18:56.022]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.

[01:19:08.393 --> 01:19:13.578]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:19:13.858 --> 01:19:17.982]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth,
[01:19:18.302 --> 01:19:18.702]  I don't know.
[01:19:40.194 --> 01:19:41.114]  BrainForce is here.
[01:19:41.315 --> 01:19:43.415]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:19:43.515 --> 01:19:48.258]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.

[01:19:50.198 --> 01:19:51.699]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:19:51.799 --> 01:19:55.001]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:19:55.281 --> 01:19:57.081]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:19:57.262 --> 01:19:58.162]  It doesn't have stimulants.

[01:20:14.418 --> 01:20:18.519]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:25.981 --> 01:20:29.502]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:20:30.063 --> 01:20:31.863]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:32.843 --> 01:20:35.784]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:20:35.804 --> 01:20:37.325]  Run on for a long time.
[01:20:37.385 --> 01:20:39.185]  Here's the USA Today headline.
[01:20:39.205 --> 01:20:41.466]  Has World War III already started?
[01:20:43.899 --> 01:20:45.180]  Here's a CNN headline.
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:46.941]  How is this not World War 3?
[01:20:47.021 --> 01:20:50.123]  Here's a New York Times headline.
[01:20:50.583 --> 01:20:51.144]  World War 3!
[01:20:53.585 --> 01:20:57.408]  Former CIA operative Robert Baer says get ready for World War 3.
[01:20:57.488 --> 01:21:01.270]  Says this is the most dangerous time in the Middle East he's ever seen.
[01:21:03.311 --> 01:21:05.673]  I'm not saying this is coming or going to happen.
[01:21:05.793 --> 01:21:10.516]  I'm simply pointing out that the people running our country
[01:21:12.313 --> 01:21:25.160]  Openly have funded Al-Qaeda slash Al-Nusra slash ISIS, same Wahhabist group, same flag, same people, for five years to engage in all sorts of criminal activities in Libya, Syria, Egypt, all over.
[01:21:25.601 --> 01:21:30.944]  Clearly a deal was made to turn them loose.
[01:21:34.045 --> 01:21:36.607]  And these people are just, just total jokes.
[01:21:39.981 --> 01:21:42.663]  No one will allow an actual military confrontation with them.
[01:21:42.683 --> 01:21:47.666]  Well, the Russians have gone in because they really do face a lot of Islamic terror and have been attacking them.
[01:21:49.067 --> 01:21:57.652]  And it is surreal to talk to so many veterans I know and others that were trained on Cold War doctrine and, you know, hate the Russian military and all the rest of it to say, no, they're in the right.
[01:21:58.854 --> 01:22:04.260]  And it's part of this globalism to then worldwide destroy America's image and have us do bad things.
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:11.808]  Where domestically we're told this cover story and people still think it's okay, but internationally people know we're backing al-Qaeda.
[01:22:12.508 --> 01:22:15.652]  They know we're overthrowing countries for no reason and putting people worse in.
[01:22:17.754 --> 01:22:20.597]  Joel Skousen is our guest, editor of WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[01:22:22.148 --> 01:22:23.329]  Best-selling author, researcher.
[01:22:23.349 --> 01:22:28.013]  Again, his book, Strategic Relocation, is the Bible for survival.
[01:22:28.033 --> 01:22:30.736]  It's about the safest places in the world and also the United States.
[01:22:31.356 --> 01:22:35.480]  I've talked a lot about the elites making an exodus in a buildup.
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:37.422]  I'm not saying something big is happening.
[01:22:37.922 --> 01:22:39.304]  I'm simply saying the climate
[01:22:39.864 --> 01:22:52.852]  for crises is getting more intense every day, but getting into these S-400s that the Russians have moved in and other anti-aircraft missiles, and then NATO reportedly, well, the United States quit putting aircraft into Syria as soon as these were deployed.
[01:22:52.872 --> 01:22:58.355]  I don't know how much of this is propaganda, how much of this is true, but, Joel, I've been asking a lot of the questions here.
[01:22:58.395 --> 01:23:05.820]  Specifically, though, on the larger issue of all this, Russia is becoming more Christian with their Orthodox faith.
[01:23:06.974 --> 01:23:14.383]  I don't, again, have romanticism for Russia, but at the same time, you look at how decadent and evil the people are that run America.
[01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:19.248]  When you pull back from this worldwide, it's bigger than nation states, bigger than the UN.
[01:23:20.069 --> 01:23:24.414]  It really is a war on men, a war on families, a war on women, a war on Christ.
[01:23:26.926 --> 01:23:33.175]  To see our government siding with the persecution of Christians all over the world is, I think, all anyone really needs to know.
[01:23:33.195 --> 01:23:36.400]  And then I wonder, why is there a war on Christianity?
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:38.944]  I know you've written a lot about that, but Joel Skousen, go ahead.
[01:23:41.283 --> 01:23:44.624]  Well, there are three predator centers in the world.
[01:23:44.684 --> 01:23:48.166]  There are the Anglo-American globalists, there's the Russians and the Chinese.
[01:23:48.386 --> 01:23:51.167]  None of them intend to defend liberty or Christianity.
[01:23:51.947 --> 01:24:00.611]  Putin's pretensions about defending the Christian Church really are just pretensions, just as he pretends to not be a communist.
[01:24:00.691 --> 01:24:02.972]  I mean, the fall of the Soviet Union was a
[01:24:03.672 --> 01:24:06.253]  Well, they do still keep the hammer and sickle on the tanks.
[01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:35.644]  You know, like the in-depth Christianity and wide variety that you have in the United States, there is a persecution of Christianity going on on the part of the globalists.
[01:24:35.724 --> 01:24:38.946]  That is a satanic-driven conspiracy.
[01:24:39.346 --> 01:24:48.509]  But I do believe, just as Hitler had his occultic connections, that the Russians and Chinese, too, have been promised by their satanic forces that they're going to win as well.
[01:24:48.529 --> 01:24:48.669]  Sure.
[01:24:48.730 --> 01:24:51.090]  They're all struggling for control of the world order.
[01:24:51.130 --> 01:24:52.171]  That's why all of them back it.
[01:24:53.188 --> 01:24:53.589]  That's right.
[01:24:53.689 --> 01:25:01.357]  But remember this, and this is why I do not believe that World War III is imminent from the Middle East crisis that we now face.
[01:25:01.498 --> 01:25:06.884]  First of all, remember that Putin and Russia and China are waiting for the U.S.
[01:25:06.904 --> 01:25:09.226]  to continue to make itself the bully of the world.
[01:25:09.807 --> 01:25:13.792]  So by intervening and taking advantage of the phony war on terror,
[01:25:14.412 --> 01:25:23.536]  Russia, and by allowing and not taking retaliation for the FSU's 24 shoot down, the Russians come out as the good guy, the globalists the bad guy.
[01:25:23.576 --> 01:25:24.316]  This will continue.
[01:25:24.336 --> 01:25:31.859]  In fact, the globalists themselves have this as a goal to make themselves the hated bully of the world, to hand Russian China the excuse.
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:34.801]  But remember, the globalists don't want a conventional war.
[01:25:35.561 --> 01:25:44.123]  They want to induce a nuclear war from Russia and China, and that's still at least four or five years off because the Russians and Chinese aren't ready yet.
[01:25:44.703 --> 01:25:57.166]  Remember, it does nothing for the globalists to get into a shooting conventional war with Russia over the Middle East, because that does not goad the world into forming a militarized global government.
[01:25:58.047 --> 01:26:02.888]  But if you wait and wait for a preemptive nuclear strike, which I think is going to be triggered by North Korea,
[01:26:04.086 --> 01:26:06.649]  If you wait for that, and they take out the U.S.
[01:26:06.729 --> 01:26:09.331]  military in a preemptive strike, and the U.S.
[01:26:09.371 --> 01:26:28.148]  missile system, then all of a sudden our global leaders can come out of their bunkers, and they're preparing for that very purpose, and say, oh, we didn't know this was going to happen, but now that our military's down, there's only one way to protect ourselves, and that's to join in a globalist military organization, with power, and then get a new currency, and all of that stuff.
[01:26:28.388 --> 01:26:29.929]  And that's all admitted by these people.
[01:26:29.949 --> 01:26:33.673]  That's what's so crazy is that it's all admitted.
[01:26:33.693 --> 01:26:57.212]  The good news is, and I want you to speak to this and correct me if you think I'm wrong, but I'm not saying it's a silver bullet, I'm not saying it's going to save us, but a lot of the high-level brass that hasn't been purged, the mid-level, the commission, the non-commissioned officers, are really starting to figure out what's going on and have been saying no to a lot of this, really unprecedented, and that's got to be a real wrinkle in all of this for the establishment.
[01:26:58.846 --> 01:26:59.246]  It is.
[01:26:59.386 --> 01:27:04.967]  They continually have to purge people who are objecting in the military.
[01:27:05.287 --> 01:27:10.809]  I mean, I saw it even when I was in the military in the 70s and the 80s, and it's gotten even worse now.
[01:27:10.849 --> 01:27:18.050]  I mean, you send all your general officers to Georgetown, which is a globalist university, for all of this training.
[01:27:18.090 --> 01:27:21.611]  You hire a lot of globalists to speak to the National War College.
[01:27:21.631 --> 01:27:24.611]  You just indoctrinate, indoctrinate these military officers.
[01:27:24.911 --> 01:27:26.992]  And the ones that protest, they don't make general.
[01:27:28.283 --> 01:27:34.666]  And, you know, so that's the problem that we face, is a lot of globalist yes-men rising through the ranks.
[01:27:35.546 --> 01:27:44.670]  I mean, that's why the military curtails InfoWars.com on the military, you know, internet channels and in my website so that people can't... That's right.
[01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:48.452]  I mean, folks need to understand, they don't block out the communist Chinese websites.
[01:27:48.472 --> 01:27:50.793]  They don't block out the racist sites.
[01:27:50.813 --> 01:27:52.154]  They don't block out the porn sites.
[01:27:52.174 --> 01:27:56.716]  They block WorldAffairsBrief.com, InfoWars.com, because they're scared of what's there.
[01:27:58.191 --> 01:28:03.515]  Yeah, the truth really is getting through and it's just like what's happening in Europe with the anti-EU sentiment.
[01:28:04.296 --> 01:28:08.619]  They're going to use, as you pointed out, this refugee backlash movement.
[01:28:08.999 --> 01:28:15.604]  They're going to institute pre-crime hate crimes against the dissidents and treat them as the enemy.
[01:28:15.764 --> 01:28:23.930]  This will be used as an excuse to shut down these people as they are prior to the COP21 climate change summit.
[01:28:24.171 --> 01:28:25.852]  They're shutting down dissidents right now.
[01:28:26.352 --> 01:28:26.793]  Absolutely, and...
[01:28:42.827 --> 01:28:46.268]  You know, the people don't worry about it because they're not targeting them.
[01:28:46.288 --> 01:28:48.569]  They're just targeting these rabble-rousers and dissidents.
[01:28:48.609 --> 01:28:51.670]  And I fear that's what's going to happen in the United States.
[01:28:51.710 --> 01:28:56.612]  They'll never... I mean, the general populace still thinks we're the freest nation on the world.
[01:28:56.632 --> 01:28:59.213]  They do not see the tyranny building.
[01:28:59.233 --> 01:28:59.814]  They do not.
[01:28:59.874 --> 01:29:03.255]  Because it's not attacking them personally, but it is... Don't scowl and stay there.
[01:29:03.755 --> 01:29:04.835]  This is so important.
[01:29:10.009 --> 01:29:19.899]  Most of the InfoWars radio listening audience is aware of the high quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at htfirearms.com.
[01:29:20.119 --> 01:29:26.105]  One of the most exciting things about htfirearms.com is the ability to upgrade your AR-15 platform today.
[01:29:26.265 --> 01:29:28.347]  They call it their low profile platform.

[01:31:43.514 --> 01:31:46.176]  Everybody knows I'm obsessed with win-win situations.
[01:31:46.216 --> 01:31:46.937]  That's why I coined
[01:31:46.937 --> 01:31:47.257]  I think so.
[01:32:10.273 --> 01:32:13.234]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[01:32:13.534 --> 01:32:23.177]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[01:32:37.961 --> 01:32:46.587]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[01:32:46.848 --> 01:32:53.793]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigerex herbal processing technique.

[01:33:23.613 --> 01:33:25.115]  We are on the march.
[01:33:25.495 --> 01:33:27.918]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:28.639 --> 01:33:32.343]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:33.285 --> 01:33:35.365]  877-789-2539.
[01:33:35.385 --> 01:33:41.007]  Alex, take a few calls in the next segment for Joel Skousen.
[01:33:41.027 --> 01:33:44.327]  I gotta get him back up on the weekday show that's 11 a.m.
[01:33:44.347 --> 01:33:44.888]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:44.928 --> 01:33:45.028]  now.
[01:33:45.048 --> 01:33:49.489]  We've added an hour to spend a couple hours covering all this because this guy knows what he's talking about.
[01:33:50.129 --> 01:33:51.929]  I research probably three, four hours a day.
[01:33:51.949 --> 01:33:59.231]  In the past, it was five, six, seven hours a day, but I'm so busy running the operation and family stuff that I only spend two, four hours a day in research.
[01:34:00.231 --> 01:34:02.052]  That's still more than most people do in a whole year.
[01:34:02.992 --> 01:34:08.735]  And I really don't learn much from other folks, but I learn a lot from Joel Skousen because he really has done his research.
[01:34:08.855 --> 01:34:11.396]  You can read those reports at worldaffairsbrief.com.
[01:34:13.337 --> 01:34:14.438]  Here's what it comes down to.
[01:34:14.498 --> 01:34:16.279]  More and more, I get back to fundamentals.
[01:34:16.319 --> 01:34:19.300]  We can look at all the things happening in the world and ask, why is this going on?
[01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:24.743]  But when you really get down to brass tacks, there is a spiritual war going on.
[01:34:26.013 --> 01:34:37.981]  And there is a planetary move for a world government with world taxes and world control that wants to force you to accept religious and cultural beliefs that are against your personal beliefs.
[01:34:38.161 --> 01:34:39.642]  It is an attack on free speech.
[01:34:40.283 --> 01:34:41.383]  It's an attack on free will.
[01:34:42.364 --> 01:34:43.825]  So we can look at what's happening in Russia.
[01:34:43.845 --> 01:34:46.247]  We can look at what's happening around the world.
[01:34:46.267 --> 01:34:48.308]  And you know, it all gets confusing.
[01:34:48.368 --> 01:34:53.832]  But at the end of the day, I see our leaders doing things that are even against their own interest.
[01:34:54.991 --> 01:34:56.832]  Because it's part of a greater program.
[01:34:58.373 --> 01:35:01.795]  And it is about controlling the destiny of this species.
[01:35:02.596 --> 01:35:05.338]  And that's why I'm so on fire to resist these people.
[01:35:07.359 --> 01:35:20.588]  That's why I get so angry and so upset because I understand that if we would just get out of the way of human potential and really support true free will and free association, humanity is unstoppable.
[01:35:21.903 --> 01:35:30.346]  But unfortunately, there are those that are in control of this world who are at odds with free choice and free will.
[01:35:31.406 --> 01:35:33.107]  And in the final equation, it comes down to that.
[01:35:33.707 --> 01:35:35.287]  Our enemies are not liberals, folks.
[01:35:35.448 --> 01:35:40.829]  Liberal is like Thomas Jefferson, wanting more freedom, more private property, more debate.
[01:35:41.410 --> 01:35:44.751]  What we see on our college campuses today is the opposite of that.
[01:35:44.831 --> 01:35:48.332]  It is dumbed down, mindless, cultural Marxism.
[01:35:49.471 --> 01:35:51.672]  And every fiber of my being wants to oppose it.
[01:35:52.132 --> 01:36:03.417]  Joel Skousen continuing with the geopolitical view, where you see this going, election 2016, the climate conference, global government stuff that's happening.
[01:36:03.897 --> 01:36:06.338]  I mean, everything really is starting to come to a head.
[01:36:06.578 --> 01:36:17.243]  And I get it's only going to get more intense after that, but wow, we can really see a point coming where we're going to be under a one-world corporate government if we don't get involved.
[01:36:18.959 --> 01:36:24.304]  Well, the government, the One World Conspiracy is already in charge.
[01:36:24.384 --> 01:36:25.745]  People need to understand that.
[01:36:26.226 --> 01:36:28.708]  This is not something about, we've got to stop it.
[01:36:29.008 --> 01:36:30.190]  It's already in charge.
[01:36:30.250 --> 01:36:33.693]  It runs our government, it runs every single European government.
[01:36:33.773 --> 01:36:37.857]  I agree, it has global standardization, but they want to bring it to another level of control.
[01:36:38.612 --> 01:36:39.052]  That's right.
[01:36:39.432 --> 01:36:39.993]  Absolutely.
[01:36:40.053 --> 01:36:43.214]  Another level of control, and it's going to take another war to do that.
[01:36:44.215 --> 01:37:03.604]  Remember that this phony war on terror is made principally to justify the precursors to tyranny, that is, the taking away of civil liberties, the dismantling of the resistance to cradle-to-grave surveillance, which we've got now, despite NSA saying there's a reform bill today in the Congress.
[01:37:04.144 --> 01:37:05.065]  It means nothing.
[01:37:05.645 --> 01:37:07.246]  Nothing virtually will change.
[01:37:09.372 --> 01:37:15.176]  With any of the pronouncements, because government basically... They surveilled illegally the whole time under the civil emergency.
[01:37:15.196 --> 01:37:16.016]  They ignore it all.
[01:37:16.697 --> 01:37:17.137]  Absolutely.
[01:37:17.177 --> 01:37:18.058]  They've been ignoring it.
[01:37:18.078 --> 01:37:19.179]  They've been doing what they want.
[01:37:19.659 --> 01:37:24.182]  This is only just a political and media cover.
[01:37:25.082 --> 01:37:27.744]  All of their protestations, all their degrees about reform.
[01:37:29.265 --> 01:37:34.230]  But as I say, the war on terror apparently is very, very essential to their plans.
[01:37:34.730 --> 01:37:39.274]  This is going to create, continue to create, the hatred of the United States.
[01:37:39.435 --> 01:37:45.820]  And it's very essential to people to understand that we must become the most hated nation on earth in order to justify
[01:37:46.701 --> 01:37:50.163]  Yeah, and help Russia and China justify nuking this nation.
[01:37:50.543 --> 01:37:52.844]  Now, they don't intend to destroy the nation.
[01:37:52.884 --> 01:37:54.724]  They don't intend to take down the economy.
[01:37:55.005 --> 01:37:59.486]  They're going to nuke the military so that they can blackmail the West into submission.
[01:37:59.687 --> 01:38:01.227]  That's the Russian Chinese plan.
[01:38:01.647 --> 01:38:02.688]  The globalists know that.
[01:38:03.268 --> 01:38:11.111]  They know that after that first preemptive strike falls, they're going to pull out space-based weapons or other secret weapon systems.
[01:38:11.131 --> 01:38:15.412]  They have to stop any further attacks while they regroup under the globalist agenda.
[01:38:15.892 --> 01:38:17.453]  And you'll live to see that happen.
[01:38:18.413 --> 01:38:23.555]  I mean, the elite aren't building big bunkers in resort areas in Colorado.
[01:38:23.575 --> 01:38:24.355]  They play tiddlywinks.
[01:38:25.558 --> 01:38:25.958]  That's right.
[01:38:26.058 --> 01:38:27.319]  They know that this is coming.
[01:38:27.639 --> 01:38:32.923]  The government isn't building new bunkers, you know, a quarter mile underground because of terrorism.
[01:38:32.943 --> 01:38:34.404]  So let me ask you this question, then.
[01:38:34.924 --> 01:38:36.045]  How do we stop it?
[01:38:36.105 --> 01:38:39.207]  Because, I mean, listen, I'm not bragging, but we know the Russian government listens.
[01:38:39.227 --> 01:38:40.268]  They read what you say.
[01:38:40.608 --> 01:38:41.469]  So does our government.
[01:38:41.849 --> 01:38:43.890]  Most people in the government aren't openly evil.
[01:38:43.930 --> 01:38:44.891]  They're just compromised.
[01:38:45.231 --> 01:38:46.972]  They don't want to have a nuclear war.
[01:38:46.992 --> 01:38:55.318]  I mean, the fact that we're here exposing it, the fact that we said a decade ago the Pope would call for world government, it now happened two months ago, the fact that the Liberty Movement
[01:38:55.478 --> 01:38:56.539]  Well they are committed and they've got
[01:39:20.444 --> 01:39:37.015]  They've got evil spiritual help, which the Lord tolerates because we have lost, in my opinion, the blessings of the Lord through wickedness in this world and through lack of following according to the doctrines of religion, the best of Christianity.
[01:39:37.055 --> 01:39:38.576]  We have not followed that as a nation.
[01:39:39.096 --> 01:39:42.819]  There is a remnant that is following, and that remnant, I believe, will be preserved
[01:39:43.519 --> 01:39:55.321]  As I have said before on your show, I am afraid, I do not believe, and cannot have a hope of returning the whole nation to liberty in accordance with the Founding Fathers or the world.
[01:39:55.501 --> 01:40:06.023]  I think at best, what we can do is prepare that in the chaos that will come because of this World War, there will be pockets of liberty re-established, and I'll tell you why.
[01:40:06.703 --> 01:40:08.243]  Remember when there's an EMP strike,
[01:40:12.898 --> 01:40:19.886]  Coming before this nuclear physical strike by about 15 minutes, it will take out the entire grid in the United States, probably in Canada.
[01:40:21.087 --> 01:40:23.250]  I'm not sure they're going to hit Europe at this point.
[01:40:23.890 --> 01:40:29.717]  But when the electricity goes down, there will be complete social unrest within a week, three days to a week.
[01:40:31.816 --> 01:40:39.661]  And what that does, suddenly there's nothing that keeps good people tied to the major cities where they're a small minority.
[01:40:39.701 --> 01:40:41.181]  They can never win in the major cities.
[01:40:41.221 --> 01:40:47.445]  It will drive them out into the countryside and they'll seek, I think, through the inspirational or to find
[01:40:47.965 --> 01:40:53.627]  Other like-minded people, especially out West, where you can establish new majorities of liberty.
[01:40:53.908 --> 01:41:02.971]  And I think that's why strategic relocation is so important, to prepare in advance, to know where am I going to go when this war starts, where I'm going to find more liberty.
[01:41:02.991 --> 01:41:03.852]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:41:03.872 --> 01:41:09.074]  So let's, I mean, the Ministry of Defense says they see global meltdown happening by 2020.
[01:41:09.894 --> 01:41:12.295]  We see the Department of Defense saying the same thing.
[01:41:12.315 --> 01:41:15.617]  Now, we hope this doesn't happen, but this is where it's all going.
[01:41:16.397 --> 01:41:21.827]  Why then are the elites scurrying so fast to build bunkers, to move to the Cook Islands, to move to New Zealand?
[01:41:22.288 --> 01:41:25.534]  Why are they so spooked right now if this stuff's five, ten years off?
[01:41:27.278 --> 01:41:32.140]  Well, remember, the real elite, Alex, aren't going to New Zealand or Australia.
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:33.821]  Sure, it's a lot of the nouveau riche people.
[01:41:34.381 --> 01:41:34.821]  That's right.
[01:41:35.761 --> 01:41:39.403]  The real elite know that Australia and New Zealand will be occupied by China.
[01:41:39.443 --> 01:41:43.965]  China's going to take Japan, Philippines, all the way down through Australia and New Zealand.
[01:41:44.865 --> 01:41:47.406]  The real elite are staying in the United States.
[01:41:48.327 --> 01:41:51.508]  They know that they can survive... Building Ozark bunkers and...
[01:41:52.108 --> 01:41:58.251]  Yeah, Ozark, Colorado Mountains, a lot of them building bunkers there under elite ski resorts and other things.
[01:41:59.011 --> 01:42:02.893]  They intend to prosper after this, just like the elite did after World War II.
[01:42:03.954 --> 01:42:10.177]  And you talk about the fact, why would the elite commit suicide by creating a nuclear holocaust on the very end?
[01:42:10.197 --> 01:42:14.119]  They're going to buy everything up and turn us into a super fascist world government enforcement system.
[01:42:14.878 --> 01:42:15.979]  That's right, and they'll own it.
[01:42:16.039 --> 01:42:22.264]  Now the Chinese think they're going to blackmail us into submission and they'll run the New World Order and so the Russians, but that's not going to happen.
[01:42:22.484 --> 01:42:24.766]  The globalists aren't disarming for nothing.
[01:42:25.166 --> 01:42:29.669]  They're simply inducing or helping to induce the Russians and Chinese to strike.
[01:42:29.729 --> 01:42:31.671]  They want this strike, but I predict
[01:42:32.171 --> 01:42:37.836]  That the globalists will cut a deal during World War 3 with China to betray Russia and attack its rear.
[01:42:38.116 --> 01:42:40.859]  I think you'll see that happen someday and Russia will go down.
[01:42:41.419 --> 01:42:53.270]  Then it will be a new Cold War between the globalists and China and the globalists want that because what better way to justify maintaining the global army than to say we've now got a new Cold War on.
[01:42:54.517 --> 01:42:55.538]  Yeah, that's 1984, writ large.

[01:47:14.424 --> 01:47:17.126]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:17.206 --> 01:47:19.168]  Final segment, folks, with Joel Skousen.
[01:47:19.208 --> 01:47:19.709]  Get ready.
[01:47:21.010 --> 01:47:21.770]  Paul, guess what?
[01:47:21.910 --> 01:47:22.011]  What?
[01:47:22.291 --> 01:47:24.553]  We bugged Mr. Blake's cell and we heard him talking to his lawyer.
[01:47:24.833 --> 01:47:27.015]  You see, we took the mic and we hit it up in the cell window.
[01:47:27.055 --> 01:47:27.655]  Wait a minute.
[01:47:28.316 --> 01:47:29.337]  What are you talking about?
[01:47:29.477 --> 01:47:30.778]  We bugged Mr. Blake's cell.
[01:47:31.795 --> 01:47:32.396]  You what?
[01:47:32.736 --> 01:47:34.658]  We bugged the cell with Arnold's tape recorder.
[01:47:34.838 --> 01:47:35.779]  Just listen to this, Paul.
[01:47:35.859 --> 01:47:36.760]  I can't listen to that.
[01:47:36.921 --> 01:47:37.361]  But Paul!
[01:47:37.421 --> 01:47:38.803]  Opie, I can't listen to that.
[01:47:38.923 --> 01:47:39.804]  I'm not permitted.
[01:47:40.284 --> 01:47:41.566]  But Paul, you don't understand.
[01:47:41.586 --> 01:47:43.688]  Opie, I can't listen to this.
[01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:46.591]  Now, I told you about eavesdropping.
[01:47:46.851 --> 01:47:47.992]  But Paul, this is different.
[01:47:48.293 --> 01:47:49.234]  Yes, it's worse.
[01:47:49.972 --> 01:47:52.895]  You overheard a conversation that was supposed to be private.
[01:47:53.295 --> 01:47:55.077]  Now, I can't be a party to that.
[01:47:55.097 --> 01:47:58.620]  But, Paul, if you just listen to this... Opie, I can't listen.
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:00.161]  Paul, you're erasing the tape!
[01:48:00.221 --> 01:48:02.003]  That's what I mean to do.
[01:48:03.424 --> 01:48:06.707]  You bugged a conversation between a lawyer and his client.
[01:48:07.668 --> 01:48:11.411]  Now, that's violating one of the most sacred rights of privacy.
[01:48:11.952 --> 01:48:13.513]  But, Paul... No buts.
[01:48:14.134 --> 01:48:16.356]  But if it helps the law... Opie...
[01:48:17.162 --> 01:48:20.085]  The law can't use this kind of help.
[01:48:22.166 --> 01:48:27.771]  And that, of course, was back from the 1950s, 1960s, with Mayberry.
[01:48:27.791 --> 01:48:29.853]  And now look where we are today.
[01:48:29.893 --> 01:48:35.978]  We fought the supposed Soviet Union because of warrantless spying, and now we do it here at a level never before imagined.
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:40.122]  We are in the hands of very, very evil people.
[01:48:41.863 --> 01:48:42.764]  That's what it comes down to.
[01:48:44.799 --> 01:48:55.184]  And I think about what the elite think of us, that they would openly fund Al-Qaeda to run around and murder hundreds of thousands of people in the Middle East, and then have our military give them weapons.
[01:48:56.264 --> 01:49:04.467]  And even when our military comes out, and the former head of Defense Intelligence comes out, and says we were ordered to back Al-Qaeda, we think it's terrible, nothing happens!
[01:49:05.388 --> 01:49:12.371]  So the generals are doing the right thing, the enlisted are doing the right thing, but the average American is so politically ignorant
[01:49:14.281 --> 01:49:15.702]  That it almost doesn't do anything.
[01:49:17.062 --> 01:49:23.145]  And I guess it does come down to what Joel Skousen was talking about, those with eyes to see, ears to hear, let them hear, let them see.
[01:49:24.645 --> 01:49:28.187]  It's just so cartoonishly dumb, the direction we're going in.
[01:49:29.656 --> 01:49:33.579]  And it makes me really sit back and think, who does run this whole thing?
[01:49:33.619 --> 01:49:41.486]  That they would want to just overthrow countries and have Al-Qaeda cut Christians' heads off by the hundreds of thousands for fun?
[01:49:42.267 --> 01:49:44.809]  I mean, our government really is a bunch of crazy freaks!
[01:49:46.810 --> 01:49:47.971]  See, to them, that's a fetish.
[01:49:48.011 --> 01:49:48.712]  That's fun.
[01:49:49.072 --> 01:49:49.753]  This is cute.
[01:49:49.813 --> 01:49:50.954]  These are evil people, folks.
[01:49:52.196 --> 01:49:54.497]  Because they know we're not going to go along with their agenda.
[01:49:54.517 --> 01:49:58.577]  Joel Skousen, I want to take a few phone calls from Frank and Taylor and a few others on this.
[01:49:58.677 --> 01:50:08.220]  People want to talk about this Planned Parenthood attack with a guy that thought he was a woman and had reported connections to sex crimes and now they're calling him a conservative with no evidence.
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:17.162]  But so much more is going on in the world, but it really just does come down to the general public so disconnected from reality.
[01:50:17.202 --> 01:50:17.982]  How do you even reach them?
[01:50:20.322 --> 01:50:38.588]  Yeah, and when you have multiple false flag operations and all of these shootings are either mentally unstable or mind-controlled people or on mood-altering drugs under the subjection of hypnosis, they can just keep throwing one of these after another at us until, as Obama says today, enough is enough.
[01:50:38.628 --> 01:50:46.270]  We've got to have gun control, of course, which isn't going to solve anything except, you know, further the agenda of disarming America.
[01:50:47.846 --> 01:50:52.370]  Don't, let me ask you this, how are things going for the globalists, you know, the dominant power group?
[01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:58.816]  I mean, they're having a lot of successes, but at the same time, it is causing a major awakening because they're uncloaking.
[01:51:00.373 --> 01:51:08.059]  Well, you've got to remember that we are winning only in the ideological battle.
[01:51:08.179 --> 01:51:12.843]  It is rising against the globalists, and that's why they're going to give us a World War III.
[01:51:13.303 --> 01:51:14.785]  It silences everything.
[01:51:15.065 --> 01:51:19.068]  It's what Helmut Kohl told the Maastricht Treaty delegates in 1997.
[01:51:19.108 --> 01:51:21.950]  He said, do this or there'll be a war.
[01:51:22.731 --> 01:51:25.974]  Yeah, he said, look, if you don't accept this, there's going to be a war.
[01:51:26.054 --> 01:51:28.356]  And they said, well, there's no sentiment for war in Europe.
[01:51:29.196 --> 01:51:31.941]  And they didn't realize, as a globalist, he was saying, we're going to give you a war.
[01:51:31.982 --> 01:51:35.749]  Well, that's what Paulson said when Congress wouldn't give trillions to foreign banks.
[01:51:35.789 --> 01:51:38.073]  He said, listen, you want blood and tanks in the streets?
[01:51:38.374 --> 01:51:39.295]  We'll have them next week!
[01:51:41.288 --> 01:51:41.788]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:51:42.389 --> 01:51:46.012]  So, what I'm just saying is this is beyond our ability to stop.
[01:51:46.112 --> 01:51:59.323]  Even if Ron Paul had got elected and tasked the NSA to eavesdrop on Rockefeller, on Kissinger, to try to get the goods on these globalists about conspiring to take away liberty, do you think the NSA would abide?
[01:51:59.383 --> 01:52:00.925]  No, they'd just say there's nothing on this.
[01:52:01.505 --> 01:52:07.811]  When they control the dark side of the FBI, the CIA, the Justice Department, the NSA,
[01:52:08.471 --> 01:52:09.833]  How do you get justice done?
[01:52:09.853 --> 01:52:10.774]  They control the courts.
[01:52:10.814 --> 01:52:14.197]  They would throw it out even if we had the evidence against them.
[01:52:14.237 --> 01:52:20.163]  But don't the dark side operators know that 98% of them weren't going to be given entrance to the underground bunkers?
[01:52:21.024 --> 01:52:22.286]  Plus, there's souls on the line.
[01:52:22.306 --> 01:52:23.307]  I mean, what's wrong with these people?
[01:52:24.218 --> 01:52:28.000]  I don't think a lot of them really frankly know what the endgame is.
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:33.522]  They just know we gotta say yes, this is a powerful control system and we don't dare say no.
[01:52:33.542 --> 01:52:43.366]  I mean, even the two generals that did buck Obama during the Benghazi stand-down order have refused to go public with it, have refused because their pensions have been threatened.
[01:52:43.887 --> 01:52:48.749]  So they may have the courage to have not stood down or refused to stand on order.
[01:52:48.789 --> 01:52:53.631]  They don't have the courage to blow the whistle on this control system because they don't know how powerful it is.
[01:52:53.911 --> 01:53:02.684]  What did you make of Michael Flynn a couple months ago, the former head of Defense Intelligence General, going public and saying we were ordered to back Al Qaeda, it's terrible, it's horrible, on national television?
[01:53:04.537 --> 01:53:05.097]  Took guts.
[01:53:05.698 --> 01:53:08.038]  You know, it only happens once they're retired, though.
[01:53:08.078 --> 01:53:09.759]  They never do it when they're in office.
[01:53:10.019 --> 01:53:13.041]  But it shows that these guys are not bad people on average.
[01:53:13.061 --> 01:53:13.941]  They're really freaked out.
[01:53:13.961 --> 01:53:14.221]  Absolutely.
[01:53:14.681 --> 01:53:15.502]  No, absolutely.
[01:53:15.582 --> 01:53:17.422]  But they have trained to be yes men.
[01:53:17.683 --> 01:53:18.823]  I mean, I was in the military.
[01:53:18.883 --> 01:53:20.904]  I saw it even at the field grade officers.
[01:53:21.464 --> 01:53:22.625]  You just said yes.
[01:53:22.805 --> 01:53:27.667]  I mean, there isn't anybody who's in the military that doesn't see a horrible waste of money
[01:53:28.527 --> 01:53:38.059]  Why don't they follow the order like our officers used to, the Bill of Rights and Constitution, that in George Washington, that's the real commander, Jesus Christ, not these corrupt politicians.
[01:53:39.298 --> 01:53:47.587]  Well, they've been trained that we're under civilian control and to say yes, and believe me, you start giving any anti-government sentiments and you're out.
[01:53:47.827 --> 01:53:49.149]  I mean, it's ruthless.
[01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:54.455]  So there are consequences for courage in today's world and very few people have it.
[01:53:54.535 --> 01:53:56.076]  And the ones that do have the courage leave.
[01:53:56.237 --> 01:53:57.738]  That's why I had to leave the military.
[01:53:58.815 --> 01:54:04.577]  Isn't it dangerous to have a bunch of politicians that have never been in the military now playing general?
[01:54:04.817 --> 01:54:08.039]  And then it's kind of scary that our own corrupt military is the one saying no.
[01:54:08.559 --> 01:54:09.699]  Usually the generals want war.
[01:54:09.759 --> 01:54:12.660]  It's scary when the generals are saying no and Obama wants all these wars.
[01:54:13.141 --> 01:54:13.801]  This is scary.
[01:54:15.563 --> 01:54:16.043]  Well, it is.
[01:54:16.723 --> 01:54:22.225]  I really believe that you don't necessarily need a great deal of military expertise to be the president.
[01:54:22.245 --> 01:54:23.085]  You need principles.
[01:54:23.725 --> 01:54:26.066]  You need the proper constitutional ideology.
[01:54:26.086 --> 01:54:27.726]  You need to know the limits of law.
[01:54:27.866 --> 01:54:34.168]  And then you hire the military experts to advise you properly, but you run through the filter of what's right and wrong.
[01:54:34.488 --> 01:54:36.128]  You've got to have a good sense of conscience.
[01:54:36.148 --> 01:54:38.009]  You've got to know what's right and wrong.
[01:54:38.189 --> 01:54:39.209]  And that's the problem.
[01:54:39.229 --> 01:54:42.430]  We're electing people who are compromisers, who are
[01:54:43.050 --> 01:54:44.752]  Yeah, I'm a Marine myself, Marine veteran.
[01:54:44.772 --> 01:54:48.776]  I was just a low-level infantry officer, NCO.
[01:55:04.201 --> 01:55:09.903]  You know, I wanted to ask, Mr. Skousen, did you have like an epiphany or something?
[01:55:10.664 --> 01:55:15.806]  I mean, was it a process or when did you wake up and was it, I mean, was it something?
[01:55:16.813 --> 01:55:19.836]  It happened when you were in the military or later or what?
[01:55:19.916 --> 01:55:20.997]  And I agree with you.
[01:55:21.017 --> 01:55:31.548]  I always seek out your insight at least once a month because I feel like I'm falling behind because I think you're probably, your analysis is probably the most grounded out there.
[01:55:31.788 --> 01:55:32.048]  It is.
[01:55:32.148 --> 01:55:34.090]  Frank, thank you so, so, so specifically.
[01:55:34.130 --> 01:55:34.851]  What was your question?
[01:55:35.271 --> 01:55:36.192]  At what point did he wake up?
[01:55:36.232 --> 01:55:36.893]  Let's get that answered.
[01:55:38.168 --> 01:55:42.970]  Yeah, you know, it actually happened when I was about 17 years old when I read my uncle's book, The Naked Communist.
[01:55:43.710 --> 01:55:47.431]  It wasn't so much the revelations about how many communists were in government.
[01:55:47.911 --> 01:55:54.454]  What was in the book, though, was how many people in the State Department, higher-ups, that were not communists, that were protecting the communists.
[01:55:54.954 --> 01:55:56.134]  That turned on a lightbulb.
[01:55:56.214 --> 01:55:56.935]  I said, uh-oh.
[01:55:56.955 --> 01:56:00.016]  You know, it'd be one thing to directly root out communists.
[01:56:00.076 --> 01:56:02.116]  It's another thing to root out people.
[01:56:02.396 --> 01:56:04.657]  And we didn't know about the term globalist in those days.
[01:56:04.697 --> 01:56:06.158]  But that was the control level above.
[01:56:06.838 --> 01:56:14.924]  That was the control level above, and I reached a conclusion early in my life that Alger Hiss, for example, even though he did join the Communist Party, was not a communist.
[01:56:14.984 --> 01:56:15.925]  He was a globalist.
[01:56:16.865 --> 01:56:22.890]  Joining the party to make it look like that's the reason he was facilitating them so that they wouldn't suspect.
[01:56:23.770 --> 01:56:25.132]  But in fact, he was a globalist.
[01:56:25.612 --> 01:56:26.793]  Wrote the UN Charter.
[01:56:27.574 --> 01:56:38.724]  So, you know, it started with my uncle's book, The Naked Communist, but it has to be grounded in a person whose sense in their spirit, in their consciousness, something's wrong, that the establishment line is not true.
[01:56:39.225 --> 01:56:40.726]  And some people have it, some people don't.
[01:56:40.766 --> 01:56:41.326]  Absolutely.
[01:56:41.387 --> 01:56:42.928]  Taylor, Colorado Springs, go ahead.
[01:56:42.968 --> 01:56:43.508]  Thanks for holding.
[01:56:43.529 --> 01:56:44.569]  You're on the air with Joel Skousen.
[01:56:45.911 --> 01:56:48.473]  Mr. Jones, Mr. Skousen, great to talk to both of you.
[01:56:48.733 --> 01:56:49.274]  Thanks, go ahead.
[01:56:50.802 --> 01:56:54.109]  Hey, never let a good crisis go to waste, right?
[01:56:56.994 --> 01:56:57.255]  Yep.
[01:56:58.056 --> 01:57:02.906]  Um, this, this thing happened just minutes away from where I live and, uh...
[01:57:04.156 --> 01:57:08.538]  Just never ceases to amaze me how quick the left jumps all over this.
[01:57:08.838 --> 01:57:13.100]  Within 15 minutes of it being announced, Friday, they were saying he was a right winger.
[01:57:13.401 --> 01:57:14.481]  Still no proof has been made.
[01:57:14.521 --> 01:57:16.622]  He said he was a woman in filings.
[01:57:16.882 --> 01:57:19.103]  It looks like a wind-up toy cutout.
[01:57:19.544 --> 01:57:20.724]  I mean, who knows what's going on?
[01:57:20.764 --> 01:57:24.986]  The point is, statistically, almost no one's dying from, you know, being killed by guns.
[01:57:25.046 --> 01:57:27.287]  It's all just a red herring to disarm a Schulz-Cousin.
[01:57:28.008 --> 01:57:30.209]  Did you see his eyes in the mugshot?
[01:57:32.938 --> 01:57:35.459]  If you look at the eyes, this guy is spaced out.
[01:57:35.679 --> 01:57:38.240]  This guy is not concentrating.
[01:57:39.121 --> 01:57:40.942]  He's looking off into another direction.
[01:57:40.962 --> 01:57:42.142]  He's got a weird look.
[01:57:42.182 --> 01:57:45.864]  I mean, this guy is mentally unstable and they have used this.
[01:57:46.625 --> 01:57:50.947]  You know, even if there isn't direct government contact and mind control, I'm a real believer
[01:57:51.667 --> 01:57:57.870]  That, under many conditions, when you got your unstable mentally, Satan can camp out on that.
[01:57:57.890 --> 01:57:59.951]  This is just general mind control, general evil.
[01:57:59.971 --> 01:58:01.151]  Joel Scouser, thank you so much.
[01:58:01.171 --> 01:58:03.072]  They die early and aging sets in.
[01:58:03.352 --> 01:58:11.356]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:58:11.596 --> 01:58:16.621]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:58:17.021 --> 01:58:19.283]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
