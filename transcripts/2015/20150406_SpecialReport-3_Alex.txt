[00:00:10.305 --> 00:00:13.267]  Jakari Jackson here for InfoWars.com.
[00:00:13.607 --> 00:00:18.971]  You know, back in the 1950s, a bunch of comic book publishers got together and created the Comics Code Authority.
[00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:25.815]  They did this because comics were the ill of media at the time, and Congress was threatening to come down on them and censor their works.
[00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:31.779]  Fast forward to when I was a child, you had Eminem and Marilyn Manson being blamed for the shooting at Columbine.
[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.863]  When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up the school and they blame it on Marilyn.
[00:00:38.373 --> 00:00:44.478]  The point I'm trying to make here is that every generation has its own scapegoat media which is blamed for social problems.
[00:00:44.938 --> 00:00:46.299]  And this generation is no different.
[00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.060]  They talk about games like Black Ops.
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.442]  They talk about games like Grand Theft Auto.
[00:00:50.722 --> 00:00:59.589]  And while I will agree with you those games are not appropriate for children, I don't think parents should be arrested or have the police call on them for allowing their children to play such games.
[00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.612]  On the site we have a memo from the Netwitch Education Partnership.
[00:01:04.252 --> 00:01:20.175]  And it says, if your child is allowed to have inappropriate access to any game or associated product that is 18+, we will are, this is the educational partnership, we will are advise to contact the police and children's social care as it is neglectful.
[00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.435]  Now are there things in M-rated games that are inappropriate for young children?
[00:01:24.615 --> 00:01:25.296]  Of course there are.
[00:01:25.617 --> 00:01:28.641]  The same thing with R-rated movies, inexplicit content and music.
[00:01:28.982 --> 00:01:35.691]  But I'm not calling for the censorship of any of these things and I definitely don't want parents to be put in a slammer because their children experience these things.
[00:01:36.272 --> 00:01:48.377]  And since we want to talk about the school system, I'm much more concerned about what the school system is doing when you have children being kicked out of school for eating their Pop-Tarts the wrong way, or children being suspended for playing with toy guns in their front yard.
[00:01:48.678 --> 00:01:52.539]  And let us not forget, school systems spying on children through laptops.
[00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:59.062]  And while I can't pin any of those things on this particular educational system, the school systems do have a whole lot to answer for.
