[00:00:04.946 --> 00:00:06.247]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.247 --> 00:00:08.029]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.791]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.791 --> 00:00:11.372]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.372 --> 00:00:12.934]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:17.118]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.118 --> 00:00:21.162]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.074 --> 00:00:38.096]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, I've watched all the Republican presidential debates this year.
[00:00:38.096 --> 00:00:40.637]  I've covered them live on the air with the crew.
[00:00:40.637 --> 00:00:45.359]  But last night was undoubtedly the most revealing.
[00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:50.340]  It was not one of these canned, mindless debates we've seen the last few election cycles.
[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.021]  A lot of key stuff came out.
[00:00:53.035 --> 00:00:58.159]  The fact that a lot of Republican neocons want World War III and are completely unstable and insane.
[00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.323]  I mean, even Hitler and Stalin didn't talk about launching giant wars publicly.
[00:01:03.323 --> 00:01:04.124]  They just did it.
[00:01:04.124 --> 00:01:13.531]  They didn't talk about giving other countries bloody noses or blowing up superpowers' aircraft and just bizarre behavior.
[00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:17.474]  And Rand Paul really shined, in my view, last night.
[00:01:17.474 --> 00:01:19.075]  I thought he did a great job overall.
[00:01:19.075 --> 00:01:22.038]  I thought he spent too much time attacking Donald Trump.
[00:01:23.206 --> 00:01:26.008]  Which is not a good move for him, obviously, with the electorate.
[00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:28.689]  But overall, he brought up a lot of really good points.
[00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.010]  Was very aggressive.
[00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.491]  Defended Internet freedom.
[00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:37.975]  Talked about how, well, if you want World War III, elect Governor Kasich or elect Governor Christie.
[00:01:37.975 --> 00:01:40.756]  Really powerful information came out yesterday.
[00:01:40.756 --> 00:01:43.958]  We've got a bunch of clips we're going to be airing today.
[00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.960]  And we have several really informative guests joining us.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.801]  James O'Keefe.
[00:01:48.681 --> 00:02:02.049]  We'll join us for about 45 minutes of the next hour on huge developments investigating the Democratic Party and their ongoing criminal mafia organized crime racketeering operations around the country, literally.
[00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.231]  Mr. Dent, Harry Dent, will be in studio with us today.
[00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:08.152]  He's here at a conference in Austin, Texas.
[00:02:08.152 --> 00:02:10.534]  He's going to be in studio with us on the Fed
[00:02:11.514 --> 00:02:17.400]  Rate hike they say is coming, the economy and more with all his charts and the demographic cliff and the rest of it.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:26.329]  And David Knight will be hosting the fourth hour with even more of the highlights of the debate last night as well.
[00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.813]  That said, we've got the House Dems push assault weapons ban, which they swore they wouldn't do.
[00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:40.443]  Two suspects of Paris-linked attacks arrested in an Austrian refugee center.
[00:02:40.443 --> 00:02:44.225]  Dutch museum renaming art for cultural sensitivity.
[00:02:44.225 --> 00:02:50.248]  And of course, German court lets off Sharia police patrol in a major German city.
[00:02:50.248 --> 00:02:57.512]  These Sharia groups are on record in the U.S., England, and Germany, and Sweden, going around bossing people around.
[00:02:57.512 --> 00:02:58.293]  It's in the news.
[00:02:58.993 --> 00:03:04.877]  And they have all these world leaders like Merkel and Hollande and the mayor of London.
[00:03:04.877 --> 00:03:10.381]  In fact, we have that clip and we played it yesterday, saying that none of this is happening.
[00:03:10.381 --> 00:03:14.143]  And of course, those weren't terror attacks two weeks ago in San Bernardino.
[00:03:14.143 --> 00:03:18.066]  And London wasn't a terror attack, the last attack.
[00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:19.467]  And Paris wasn't a terror attack.
[00:03:19.467 --> 00:03:25.571]  And don't show women wearing burqas on TV, even though that's how they dress themselves when they machine gun people.
[00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:29.453]  Or hajib, hajobs, whatever you want to call it.
[00:03:29.453 --> 00:03:31.213]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[00:03:31.213 --> 00:03:33.194]  So, that's all coming up.
[00:03:33.194 --> 00:03:34.594]  Big world news, big U.S.
[00:03:34.594 --> 00:03:37.775]  news, politics news, science news, economy news.
[00:03:37.775 --> 00:03:38.735]  It's massive.
[00:03:38.735 --> 00:03:41.116]  But the big story on Infowars.com.
[00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:50.359]  Trump exposes the Bush family's complicity in helping the Bin Ladens escape on 9-11 while all other air traffic was shut down.
[00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.780]  We'll go out to break with a one-minute clip from my live coverage of this last night.
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.080]  Here it is.
[00:03:55.236 --> 00:03:57.417]  I mean, this is why Trump is so awesome.
[00:03:57.417 --> 00:03:59.178]  I mean, he really is a wake to the New World Order.
[00:03:59.178 --> 00:04:01.519]  Supposedly behind the scenes, I'll just say that and leave it at that.
[00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:02.779]  Inside baseball, that's what I mean.
[00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:07.301]  Who else would come back like that at the Bushes and the Clintons calling them criminals?
[00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:08.202]  And the Saudis.
[00:04:08.202 --> 00:04:09.482]  Guys, go back to your live feeds.
[00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:12.464]  We've got to go back on the DVR and grab that and play that clip again.
[00:04:12.464 --> 00:04:13.484]  That is sensational.
[00:04:13.484 --> 00:04:17.846]  That's what we should write about, is that Trump brings out the fact that the Bushes protected the Bin Ladens.
[00:04:18.246 --> 00:04:19.707]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:19.707 --> 00:04:25.212]  They wanted to go after him, saying, you know, you want to go after the families of these ISIS members, and he's absolutely right.
[00:04:25.212 --> 00:04:28.454]  Well, should we protect him like your brother did?
[00:04:28.454 --> 00:04:37.502]  Well, I mean, getting past arresting people's family members or going after them or whatever, and I'm not even endorsing that, is that Trump will come back with hardcore 9-11 truth, which is a dead fact.
[00:04:37.502 --> 00:04:37.942]  Exactly.
[00:04:43.007 --> 00:04:54.338]  When you had the World Trade Center go, people were put into planes that were friends, family, girlfriends, and they were put into planes and they were sent back for the most part to Saudi Arabia.
[00:04:54.338 --> 00:04:55.659]  They knew what was going on.
[00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:56.580]  They went home.
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.621]  We'll be back with the full clip.
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.221]  Hillary Clinton wants to censor people who make fun of her.
[00:05:01.221 --> 00:05:07.183]  She was recently trying to censor comedy skits that poked fun at her, which were produced by the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles, California.
[00:05:07.183 --> 00:05:13.765]  The owner of the Laugh Factory, Jamie Masada, told Judicial Watch that her campaign threatened to put him out of business if he didn't pull the videos.
[00:05:14.005 --> 00:05:22.874]  So in response to this attack on free speech, InfoWars.com has launched the Make Fun of Hillary Defend the First Amendment contest with a first place cash prize of $5,000.

[00:06:58.447 --> 00:07:05.369]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:08.270]  We've always offered five months free.
[00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:14.152]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[00:07:14.152 --> 00:07:17.593]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[00:07:17.593 --> 00:07:20.894]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[00:07:20.894 --> 00:07:24.215]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books, and other

[00:08:00.004 --> 00:08:06.513]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:08:06.513 --> 00:08:10.899]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:16.546]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:26.907 --> 00:08:35.735]  The Economist, former Bain Capital Analyst, will be joining us in studio in the third hour.
[00:08:35.735 --> 00:08:37.857]  David Knight hosts the fourth hour.
[00:08:37.857 --> 00:08:42.641]  We have James O'Keefe of the Veritas The Truth Project with big breaking news and analysis.
[00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:47.082]  Joining us for part of the second hour.
[00:08:47.082 --> 00:08:49.263]  We'll also have open phones today.
[00:08:49.263 --> 00:08:56.029]  A lot of clips throughout the broadcast from what I think was the most powerful Republican debate yet.
[00:08:56.029 --> 00:09:02.134]  And the one back to before this at CNBC was totally dynamite.
[00:09:02.134 --> 00:09:10.601]  Because all the candidates unloaded on the controlled press and their deceptive twisted questions meant to derail
[00:09:11.713 --> 00:09:17.518]  Any attempt by the Republican Party or the American people to defeat Hillary Clinton.
[00:09:17.518 --> 00:09:19.059]  It was a true routing of them.
[00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:27.065]  They were like beaten wet dogs, reportedly, after the debate because no one groveled to their hoax.
[00:09:27.065 --> 00:09:30.528]  No one groveled to the media putting on its front.
[00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:39.395]  And watching on CNN last night, in the buildup, in the hours before it, Anderson Cooper, the CIA officer, leading all the other little stuffed shirts up there,
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.802]  Both male and female.
[00:09:42.802 --> 00:09:43.823]  He was excited.
[00:09:43.823 --> 00:09:45.244]  He was narcissistic.
[00:09:45.244 --> 00:09:47.446]  He was rocking back and forth in his seat.
[00:09:47.446 --> 00:09:49.107]  He had his best tie on.
[00:09:49.107 --> 00:09:50.908]  He had his best suit on.
[00:09:50.908 --> 00:09:55.732]  Why, they actually had an audience of tens of millions last night.
[00:09:55.732 --> 00:10:00.116]  His normal audience isn't even a half million during prime time.
[00:10:00.116 --> 00:10:03.659]  It's only when there's a mass shooting or an earthquake that a few people tune in.
[00:10:04.912 --> 00:10:08.995]  Gone are the days of 10, 20, 30 million viewers of CNN.
[00:10:08.995 --> 00:10:13.678]  They're down to 500,000 on their biggest shows.
[00:10:13.678 --> 00:10:17.340]  Same thing for MSNBC.
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.343]  So they've got to do the attack-dogging on CNBC now, because it still has a little bit of an audience.
[00:10:21.343 --> 00:10:23.705]  Oh, but people don't buy into that, so their ratings go down.
[00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.690]  They have flatlined.
[00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:31.112]  And when they have a big debate like this, because there's so much interest, they have a dead cat balance.
[00:10:31.112 --> 00:10:33.252]  As many as 40 million people.
[00:10:33.252 --> 00:10:34.552]  In fact, let's get the latest numbers.
[00:10:34.552 --> 00:10:35.613]  I didn't look that up this morning.
[00:10:35.613 --> 00:10:39.014]  I know some of the other debates have had 45, 50 million people tune in.
[00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:40.114]  This one was slated to have even more.
[00:10:40.114 --> 00:10:41.594]  That was a number I didn't look up.
[00:10:41.594 --> 00:10:43.675]  Can we look up the Nielsen's on this?
[00:10:43.675 --> 00:10:51.057]  Whereas Nielsen's been caught fluffing and pumping up the ratings for CNN and MSNBC.
[00:10:51.057 --> 00:10:52.197]  But, I mean, you've got to.
[00:10:53.288 --> 00:10:58.372]  Republican primary debate was likely third most watched ever.
[00:10:58.372 --> 00:11:03.075]  According to CNN, if you scroll down, they might give us the actual number.
[00:11:03.075 --> 00:11:07.858]  Drumroll, please.
[00:11:07.858 --> 00:11:10.000]  CNBC, 14 million.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.541]  Fox Business averaged 13.5 million.
[00:11:11.541 --> 00:11:14.763]  Fox News averaged 25 million viewers.
[00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:27.741]  And CNN is estimating, drum roll, $15.3 million in their October debate.
[00:11:27.741 --> 00:11:28.862]  So, there you have it.
[00:11:28.862 --> 00:11:31.683]  I don't think they even say, oh, they haven't released it yet.
[00:11:31.683 --> 00:11:32.144]  There you go.
[00:11:32.144 --> 00:11:34.085]  No wonder I don't know.
[00:11:34.085 --> 00:11:39.008]  So, I guess they've got to figure that out off all the DVRs, because that's where they get it from now.
[00:11:39.008 --> 00:11:42.650]  They know exactly, roughly, how many households, how many people watch.
[00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.331]  The point is, a lot of people watch.
[00:11:44.331 --> 00:11:45.432]  $20 million, $30 million.
[00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:51.588]  This is a big audience for them.
[00:11:51.588 --> 00:11:56.691]  This is the only time they get to imagine that they're still dominant.
[00:11:56.691 --> 00:11:59.192]  Are these rare events like Blue Moons.
[00:11:59.192 --> 00:12:03.195]  But it is on these Blue Moons they can still ram a hoax through.
[00:12:03.195 --> 00:12:11.219]  You had the deranged drugged out lunatic kill nine innocent black people in cold blood, reportedly.
[00:12:11.219 --> 00:12:12.680]  So much stuff is staged, who knows.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.161]  But let's just say it's true.
[00:12:14.161 --> 00:12:15.222]  It's outrageous.
[00:12:15.222 --> 00:12:15.682]  It's horrible.
[00:12:18.274 --> 00:12:21.696]  And the media got states to remove the rebel flag.
[00:12:21.696 --> 00:12:23.837]  Collectively, they blame gun owners.
[00:12:23.837 --> 00:12:24.938]  It was white people's fault.
[00:12:24.938 --> 00:12:32.503]  It wasn't white people's fault any more than the deranged loon who went and shot the camera people and the reporter.
[00:12:32.503 --> 00:12:34.164]  It's not black people's fault.
[00:12:35.043 --> 00:12:36.944]  That some crazy black person did that?
[00:12:36.944 --> 00:12:45.129]  It's not my fault if Jeffrey Dahmer's white and goes out and grabs black kids, white kids, Hispanic kids off the street and rapes them and eats them?
[00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:46.490]  He's a psychopathic killer!
[00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.871]  It's not my fault he tortured animals when he was a kid?
[00:12:48.871 --> 00:12:51.393]  It's not my fault?
[00:12:51.393 --> 00:12:54.455]  It's not my fault when a white person does something?
[00:12:54.455 --> 00:12:57.837]  It's not black people's fault that Idi Amin ate prisoners?
[00:12:59.872 --> 00:13:04.158]  By the way, it came out in congressional testimony about ISIS eating people.
[00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:05.940]  By the way, they do that on video.
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:11.307]  They roast people, they eat their hearts, they eat their eyeballs to terrorize.
[00:13:11.307 --> 00:13:16.754]  And now it's come out that they roast the young girls, they rape and then murder, and then they roast them.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.264]  So we're going to be getting into the roasting that the mainstream media makes fun of.
[00:13:21.264 --> 00:13:24.387]  Oh, nobody makes women wear a headdress in the Middle East.
[00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:25.948]  No one restricts free speech.
[00:13:25.948 --> 00:13:27.029]  There's no stinger missiles.
[00:13:27.029 --> 00:13:28.291]  There's no tow missiles.
[00:13:28.291 --> 00:13:35.598]  There's no terrorists in amongst the... ...refugees.
[00:13:37.287 --> 00:13:39.348]  So that's what's coming up today.
[00:13:39.348 --> 00:13:46.231]  Now, before I go any further, let's just read over some of the headlines that are at Infowars.com with the video clips that are just bombshell.
[00:13:46.231 --> 00:13:50.833]  Trump exposed how Bush family helped Bin Laden's escape after 9-11.
[00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:51.753]  Bombshell.
[00:13:51.753 --> 00:14:00.517]  While air traffic was shut down across the United States for two days, the president allowed the Bin Ladens to be flown out of the country to safety on more than 15 flights.
[00:14:04.349 --> 00:14:07.490]  Now, I've covered this from the day it happened.
[00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:10.051]  It was in the Miami Herald and other papers.
[00:14:10.051 --> 00:14:26.999]  They would actually have people get on TV back in 2001, 2002, 2003, and they would say that I was a liar and this was a conspiracy theory, hoping you wouldn't go look up NBC News, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, the Miami
[00:14:27.987 --> 00:14:28.688]  Newspapers.
[00:14:28.688 --> 00:14:30.649]  I mean, it was in five or six big papers.
[00:14:30.649 --> 00:14:33.631]  McClatchy covered it out of Florida.
[00:14:33.631 --> 00:14:40.015]  It was on all the TV stations because people were there protesting as they were getting on their jets.
[00:14:40.015 --> 00:14:52.664]  This was an evacuation of the Bin Ladens, who the Bushes were having dinner with the morning or breakfast with at the arms summit at their table.
[00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:57.367]  So the point is, is that Trump is planning to use 9-11 truth on Jebby.
[00:15:24.571 --> 00:15:34.380]  And I've told you that, and I've told you that before Trump did it, and I've told you that after Trump did it, because I've been told by little birdies that this is the case.
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:40.565]  And let me tell you something, I went from really liking Trump to really knowing he's for real last night in my gut.
[00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:50.875]  Not perfect, a loose cannon in some respects, but actually isn't actively evil against this country, which is a big difference from Jeb Bush and Hillary, who are true agents of evil.
[00:15:52.608 --> 00:15:55.290]  Whenever, in fact, I want to find this clip.
[00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:59.793]  It's in their whole exchange.
[00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:05.117]  Whenever Jeb Bush looks at him and says, you will never be president.
[00:16:05.117 --> 00:16:07.239]  And he cuts out a little friendly boy.
[00:16:07.239 --> 00:16:08.820]  Hey kids, get in my white van.
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:09.881]  I got candy.
[00:16:09.881 --> 00:16:11.922]  Oh, I am the friendly little old man.
[00:16:11.922 --> 00:16:15.445]  Oh, people hate that goofiness because they know it's fake.
[00:16:15.445 --> 00:16:16.986]  He cut out of that and he goes, listen.
[00:16:18.797 --> 00:16:23.321]  You can probably just find the clip typing in, Jeb Bush tells Trump he will never be president.
[00:16:23.321 --> 00:16:26.624]  He goes, you will never be president!
[00:16:26.624 --> 00:16:34.571]  And that's because they own the fraudulent delegates and his people are bragging, we don't care if we have 1% of the vote, he will get the nomination and the broker convention.
[00:16:34.571 --> 00:16:37.733]  They are bragging about this.
[00:16:37.733 --> 00:16:39.675]  That's the elitism of these people.
[00:16:39.675 --> 00:16:45.080]  Let's go ahead and go to the exchange though between the two where they bring up the fact that Trump said he'd go after terrorist families.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.380]  Here it is.
[00:16:48.467 --> 00:16:49.789]  I'm Jacob from Georgia Tech.
[00:16:49.789 --> 00:16:53.455]  Recently Donald Trump mentioned that we must kill the families of ISIS members.
[00:16:53.455 --> 00:16:58.263]  However, this violates the principle of distinction between civilians and combatants in international law.
[00:16:58.263 --> 00:17:03.551]  So my question is, how would intentionally killing innocent civilians set us apart from ISIS?
[00:17:03.551 --> 00:17:03.831]  Mr. Trump.
[00:17:05.114 --> 00:17:06.675]  We have to be much tougher.
[00:17:06.675 --> 00:17:08.956]  We have to be much stronger than we've been.
[00:17:08.956 --> 00:17:10.837]  We have people that know what's going on.
[00:17:10.837 --> 00:17:13.678]  You take a look at just the attack in California the other day.
[00:17:13.678 --> 00:17:17.080]  There were numerous people, including the mother, that knew what was going on.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.521]  They saw pipe bombs sitting all over the floor.
[00:17:19.521 --> 00:17:21.222]  They saw ammunition all over the place.
[00:17:21.222 --> 00:17:22.643]  They knew exactly what was going on.
[00:17:23.263 --> 00:17:34.607]  When you had the World Trade Center go, people were put into planes that were friends, family, girlfriends, and they were put into planes and they were sent back, for the most part, to Saudi Arabia.
[00:17:34.607 --> 00:17:35.927]  They knew what was going on.
[00:17:35.927 --> 00:17:39.688]  They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television.
[00:17:39.688 --> 00:17:42.389]  I would be very, very firm with families.
[00:17:42.389 --> 00:17:44.830]  And frankly, that will make people think.
[00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:50.712]  Because they may not care much about their lives, but they do care, believe it or not, about their families' lives.
[00:17:51.352 --> 00:17:54.436]  Donald, this is not... Governor Bush, Governor Bush.
[00:17:54.436 --> 00:17:57.539]  This is another example of the lack of seriousness.
[00:17:57.539 --> 00:18:01.503]  Look, this is troubling because we're at war.
[00:18:01.503 --> 00:18:05.888]  They've declared war on us and we need to have a serious strategy to destroy ISIS.
[00:18:05.888 --> 00:18:08.771]  But the idea that that is a solution to this is just...
[00:18:09.412 --> 00:18:10.453]  It's just crazy.
[00:18:10.453 --> 00:18:12.114]  It makes no sense to suggest this.
[00:18:12.114 --> 00:18:17.098]  Look, two months ago, Donald Trump said that ISIS was not our fight.
[00:18:17.098 --> 00:18:18.420]  Just two months ago.
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:23.143]  He said that Hillary Clinton would be a great negotiator with Iran.
[00:18:23.143 --> 00:18:27.647]  And he gets his foreign policy experience from the shows.
[00:18:27.647 --> 00:18:29.669]  That is not a serious kind of candidate.
[00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:35.133]  We need someone that thinks this through, that can lead our country to safety and security.
[00:18:35.133 --> 00:18:38.096]  Mr. Trump, look, the problem is
[00:18:40.816 --> 00:18:42.076]  We need toughness.
[00:18:42.076 --> 00:18:44.537]  Honestly, I think Jeb is a very nice person.
[00:18:44.537 --> 00:18:46.837]  He's a very nice person, but we need tough people.
[00:18:46.837 --> 00:18:47.857]  We need toughness.
[00:18:47.857 --> 00:18:49.998]  We need intelligence, and we need tough.
[00:18:49.998 --> 00:18:53.719]  Jeb said when they come across the southern border, they come as an act of love.
[00:18:53.719 --> 00:18:56.699]  You said in September 30th that ISIS was not a factor.
[00:18:56.699 --> 00:18:58.200]  Am I talking or are you talking, Jeb?
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.280]  I'm talking right now.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:18:59.680]  I'm talking.
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.480]  You can go back.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.500]  You're not talking.
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.421]  You interrupted me, Jeb.
[00:19:02.421 --> 00:19:03.081]  September 30th, you said it.
[00:19:03.081 --> 00:19:04.281]  Are you going to apologize, Jeb?
[00:19:04.281 --> 00:19:05.321]  No.
[00:19:05.321 --> 00:19:06.181]  Am I allowed to finish?
[00:19:06.181 --> 00:19:07.001]  Yes, one at a time.
[00:19:07.001 --> 00:19:07.262]  Go ahead.
[00:19:07.262 --> 00:19:08.482]  Excuse me, am I allowed to finish?
[00:19:08.482 --> 00:19:09.222]  Go ahead, Mr. Trump.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:15.522]  So, again, I know you're trying to build up your energy, Jeff, but it's not a master criminal.
[00:19:15.522 --> 00:19:20.124]  That is a hardcore killer right there, folks, that Trump's going up against.
[00:19:20.124 --> 00:19:20.944]  Hardcore.
[00:19:20.944 --> 00:19:24.065]  We're not respected as a nation anymore.
[00:19:24.065 --> 00:19:26.886]  We don't have that level of respect that we need.
[00:19:26.886 --> 00:19:31.528]  And if we don't get it back, we're just going to go weaker and weaker and just disintegrate.
[00:19:31.988 --> 00:19:33.409]  We can't allow that to happen.
[00:19:33.409 --> 00:19:34.389]  Jeff Bush, good God.
[00:19:34.389 --> 00:19:36.091]  I'm leaving the country when he gets elected.
[00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:36.631]  I really will.
[00:19:36.631 --> 00:19:37.231]  I think I may.
[00:19:37.231 --> 00:19:38.992]  I just need to get away.
[00:19:38.992 --> 00:19:40.293]  And I was witness to it.
[00:19:40.293 --> 00:19:41.494]  And so was everyone else.
[00:19:41.494 --> 00:19:42.755]  And I was standing there.
[00:19:42.755 --> 00:19:44.656]  They come across as an act of love.
[00:19:44.656 --> 00:19:46.597]  He's saying the same thing right now with radicalism.
[00:19:46.597 --> 00:19:47.037]  Look at that guy.
[00:19:47.037 --> 00:19:47.658]  He's such a killer.
[00:19:47.658 --> 00:19:50.459]  They have basically the entire Nazi wealth that was put into South America.
[00:19:50.459 --> 00:19:51.420]  It just won't work.
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.741]  They run the Nazi wealth.
[00:19:52.741 --> 00:19:53.721]  I just cannot believe it.
[00:19:53.721 --> 00:19:57.264]  Donald, you're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency.
[00:19:57.264 --> 00:19:58.064]  That's not going to happen.
[00:19:58.064 --> 00:19:58.805]  And I do have this right.
[00:19:58.805 --> 00:20:00.986]  I'm taking rid of these people.
[00:20:04.397 --> 00:20:10.180]  Leadership is not about attacking people and disparaging people.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:15.101]  Leadership is about creating a serious strategy to deal with the threat of our time.
[00:20:15.101 --> 00:20:21.344]  And I laid out that strategy before the attacks in Paris and before the attacks in San Bernardino.
[00:20:21.344 --> 00:20:23.645]  And it is the way forward.
[00:20:23.645 --> 00:20:25.605]  We need to increase our military spending.
[00:20:25.605 --> 00:20:28.966]  We need to deal with a no-fly zone in Syria, a safe zone.
[00:20:28.966 --> 00:20:30.007]  We need to focus on
[00:20:30.447 --> 00:20:34.330]  Building a military that is second to none so that we can destroy Islamic terrorism.
[00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.892]  With Jeb's attitude, we will never be great again.
[00:20:36.892 --> 00:20:37.853]  That I can tell you.
[00:20:37.853 --> 00:20:38.793]  We will never be great.
[00:20:38.793 --> 00:20:40.254]  He's a globalist.
[00:20:40.254 --> 00:20:44.678]  Now I like how Trump has moderated his statement of go after their families.
[00:20:44.678 --> 00:20:46.119]  Kill them.
[00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:51.503]  It is true that that is the one tactic proven to work on Al Qaeda.
[00:20:51.503 --> 00:20:55.326]  Is they say we got your 10 year old son and we're going to start torturing him if you don't give us all the info.
[00:20:56.616 --> 00:21:04.439]  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and others spilt their guts at that point and confessed to bombing buildings that were built after they were in prison.
[00:21:04.439 --> 00:21:06.820]  They waterboarded him hundreds of times.
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.821]  Was it 200 plus?
[00:21:08.821 --> 00:21:10.402]  Going from memory?
[00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:11.882]  They said, we're going to torture your son now.
[00:21:11.882 --> 00:21:14.843]  We're going to do it and we're going to videotape it.
[00:21:14.843 --> 00:21:17.124]  He said, OK, I'll just say whatever you want.
[00:21:17.124 --> 00:21:18.085]  That's the problem, though.
[00:21:18.085 --> 00:21:19.625]  You get fake confessions with that.
[00:21:19.625 --> 00:21:23.027]  And if you don't fund the terrorists to begin with, you don't have to then go fight them later.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:30.104]  But see, that's your excuse to get into Afghanistan and control the trillions in the last decade of opium.
[00:21:30.104 --> 00:21:34.107]  It went from 6% of world production to 93% within two years.
[00:21:34.107 --> 00:21:36.729]  Oh, we really liberated Afghanistan, folks.
[00:21:36.729 --> 00:21:39.110]  Totally staged.
[00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:40.951]  But see, Trump is in a learning process here.
[00:21:40.951 --> 00:21:50.678]  It is true that if you prosecute the families who obviously know... The dad of this guy said, my son had pledged allegiance to ISIS.
[00:21:52.196 --> 00:22:01.062]  Let me tell you, if my son pledged allegiance to ISIS hypothetically and I couldn't stop it, and he was really saying that, I would have to report him.
[00:22:01.062 --> 00:22:05.825]  Because I don't want him getting killed in something, of course he wouldn't.
[00:22:05.825 --> 00:22:16.873]  I'd probably do something else, I'm not going to say it, but the point is, is that you know people are building pipe bombs, you know they're about to pull a jihad, and the whole family's coming around the house and you don't do anything about it?
[00:22:20.811 --> 00:22:23.374]  That's called aiding and abetting, is what that's called.
[00:22:23.374 --> 00:22:30.040]  And I totally agree, you gotta prosecute people's families if the evidence shows they knew about it, so people think twice.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:36.006]  Because believe me, if they knew mommy and daddy were gonna get locked up for life sentences for aiding and abetting an act of terrorism and murder...
[00:22:36.787 --> 00:22:37.908]  And mayhem?
[00:22:37.908 --> 00:22:38.669]  They won't do it.
[00:22:38.669 --> 00:22:40.430]  99% of the time.
[00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.193]  But these people love to think of themselves as heroes.
[00:22:43.193 --> 00:22:44.574]  They don't like their lives.
[00:22:44.574 --> 00:22:47.156]  They're mad at the good-looking women at the office.
[00:22:47.156 --> 00:22:49.919]  Mad she's got to wear the headdress at a subconscious level.
[00:22:49.919 --> 00:22:51.040]  But can't break her conditioning.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.601]  She's all crazed.
[00:22:52.601 --> 00:22:55.203]  Because, I mean, you know, she's not the prettiest lady around.
[00:22:55.203 --> 00:22:58.306]  I've seen some beautiful Arabic women, but this lady ain't it.
[00:22:58.306 --> 00:23:01.469]  She looks like a 60-year-old, you know, fat Arabic man or something.
[00:23:01.989 --> 00:23:02.950]  I mean, you know, I'm sorry.
[00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:03.490]  She's ugly.
[00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:05.071]  She looks like the Loch Ness Monster.
[00:23:05.071 --> 00:23:07.553]  She wants to go kill all the hot chicks at work.
[00:23:07.553 --> 00:23:10.694]  That's what happened.
[00:23:10.694 --> 00:23:16.458]  And now I got to get my guns up because some freaks you brought in this country want to go around shooting people?
[00:23:16.458 --> 00:23:17.479]  No!
[00:23:17.479 --> 00:23:18.239]  No!
[00:23:18.239 --> 00:23:18.799]  No!
[00:23:18.799 --> 00:23:21.641]  Go stay in your third world hell hole!
[00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:24.343]  Be chained up, get beat up, get raped all day.
[00:23:24.343 --> 00:23:25.143]  You love it.
[00:23:25.143 --> 00:23:27.385]  Gloria Steinem, go move over there with all these other people.
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.702]  I'll be honest with you, the women in my family are all spoiled rotten and I love it.
[00:23:32.702 --> 00:23:33.382]  But they love me.
[00:23:33.382 --> 00:23:42.006]  But I tell you, there's a lot of spoiled rotten women in this country that think the liberals, and the media, and the CIA, and the social engineers are your friends.
[00:23:42.006 --> 00:23:44.287]  They hate your stinking guts, women!
[00:23:44.287 --> 00:23:50.210]  They want you working 70 hours a week, with no pension, no future, no kids, no husband!
[00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:51.851]  Pumped full of sterolins!
[00:23:51.851 --> 00:23:55.113]  And thinking you're free!
[00:23:55.113 --> 00:23:57.734]  And the very same scum selling you this whole agenda!
[00:23:58.723 --> 00:24:04.224]  Miss Magazine, run by the CIA, declassified, did it to make sure you were all alone.
[00:24:04.224 --> 00:24:13.046]  None of the same ones that want to put you under this type of garbage and defend women not being able to drive cars and wearing hoods over their heads.
[00:24:13.046 --> 00:24:14.626]  I'm sorry, Richard, you just popped in my ear.
[00:24:14.626 --> 00:24:17.967]  Excuse me.
[00:24:17.967 --> 00:24:18.787]  Oh, yes, thank you.
[00:24:18.787 --> 00:24:21.407]  He has the, in fact, just pop on here whenever you want, bro.
[00:24:21.407 --> 00:24:24.348]  Most of the time, if you've got a clip for folks, you can just come on here.
[00:24:24.348 --> 00:24:25.328]  Let me ask you, Richard.
[00:24:26.351 --> 00:24:34.379]  Last night, covering the debate, working on the debate, being up here, putting in a great 14 hours yesterday, the whole crew, here at Infowars News Center.
[00:24:34.379 --> 00:24:35.160]  What did you think?
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.262]  Because this is unscripted, I don't know what you think of the debates.
[00:24:37.262 --> 00:24:38.122]  What did you think of the debates?
[00:24:38.122 --> 00:24:40.685]  And we have the clip of Jeb saying, you will never be president.
[00:24:40.685 --> 00:24:43.768]  That was a direct threat, where he shows the real Bush look.
[00:24:44.308 --> 00:24:48.232]  Of crazed, hardcore, original gangsters.
[00:24:48.232 --> 00:24:52.656]  You talk about James Bond villain, Superman villains, baby, they're it.
[00:24:52.656 --> 00:25:00.363]  That whole milk toast, they like to eat hamburgers and play golf and watch football games and eat their boogers on TV.
[00:25:00.363 --> 00:25:02.224]  You know, most of them get caught doing that.
[00:25:02.224 --> 00:25:05.988]  These people are absolute, total evil.
[00:25:08.106 --> 00:25:11.112]  They are the Democrats' answer to the Republican Party.
[00:25:11.112 --> 00:25:17.564]  They are Rockefeller Republicans, Democrats in the 60s that couldn't take over, and so they infiltrated the Republican Party.
[00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:23.680]  And John Boehner and all the rest of them are enemies of this country.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.581]  And of course, Boehner's gone now, but I bring that up because these are the scum.
[00:25:28.581 --> 00:25:30.222]  This is why we can't get change.
[00:25:30.222 --> 00:25:31.742]  This is why we can't cut taxes.
[00:25:31.742 --> 00:25:34.803]  This is why we can't turn our coal-powered plants back on.
[00:25:34.803 --> 00:25:39.585]  I obsess on that, folks, because our energy prices have basically doubled for electricity the last seven years.
[00:25:39.585 --> 00:25:41.245]  That has crippled us.
[00:25:41.245 --> 00:25:47.027]  No one will build factories here because you cannot compete with India and China and Mexico and 160-plus other countries.
[00:25:48.667 --> 00:25:52.149]  And I'm not against India and China and Mexico, but you know what?
[00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:54.250]  We're gonna have power plants too!
[00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.911]  We're gonna have cheap energy!
[00:25:55.911 --> 00:25:59.153]  We're gonna have a level playing field when we take this country back!
[00:25:59.153 --> 00:26:00.554]  Do you understand that?
[00:26:00.554 --> 00:26:02.215]  Get it through your heads!
[00:26:02.215 --> 00:26:06.978]  You call me a terrorist, a right-winger, because I don't want to screw our country over?
[00:26:06.978 --> 00:26:08.419]  I'm a patriot!
[00:26:08.419 --> 00:26:09.600]  I'm a libertarian!
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.881]  I'm a classical liberal!
[00:26:10.881 --> 00:26:12.942]  You people are part of a fruitcake cult!
[00:26:14.787 --> 00:26:16.107]  Chill down for a minute.
[00:26:16.107 --> 00:26:18.988]  Richard, I'm sorry, go ahead and give us your take on the debate.
[00:26:18.988 --> 00:26:23.929]  I would say Trump had a pretty strong showing, but for me Rand Paul really won the night.
[00:26:23.929 --> 00:26:26.610]  I like how he referenced the Bill of Rights birthday.
[00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:30.691]  I like how he referenced the Constitution multiple times.
[00:26:30.691 --> 00:26:37.733]  And Trump's understanding of the internet seems lacking, saying that he's going to shut down particular parts.
[00:26:37.733 --> 00:26:39.393]  That just doesn't sit very well with me.
[00:26:40.711 --> 00:26:47.013]  Well, I tend to agree with you, but I think it's refreshing that Trump is out of control and obviously not controlled by anybody.
[00:26:47.013 --> 00:26:49.213]  I think him coming on the show illustrates that further.
[00:26:49.213 --> 00:26:59.876]  Would you rather have a wild man who at least wants us to be successful, or would you become a dangerous man on a white horse, or would you rather have a Medusa on a green pus-filled horse?
[00:27:00.376 --> 00:27:06.960]  Or would you rather have a demonic, vampiric, socialist, communist goblin like Bernie Sanders hopping around like an evil golem?
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:18.027]  Or would you rather have Jeb Bush, a psycho ghoul, the head of the Bush crime family, the one that's anointed, the one that's loved by Daddy Bush, and the whole stinking Yale takeover army?
[00:27:18.027 --> 00:27:20.329]  I mean, you know, what do you do, Richard?
[00:27:22.281 --> 00:27:24.783]  That's quite a spread there.
[00:27:24.783 --> 00:27:36.312]  I think I'd like somebody who is strong, of course, is bold, wants to change things, definitely not Democratic, but somebody who's going to
[00:27:37.947 --> 00:27:39.808]  Do something in my interests.
[00:27:39.808 --> 00:27:40.629]  That's what I'm voting for.
[00:27:40.629 --> 00:27:46.173]  Somebody that is a nationalist and thinks about policies that will help the country, which we could easily do.
[00:27:46.173 --> 00:27:46.534]  Absolutely.
[00:27:46.534 --> 00:27:47.575]  Big changes need to happen.
[00:27:47.575 --> 00:27:52.498]  When I come back, I want to talk to CJ, I want to talk to anybody else in there that has comments, Nico, whoever.
[00:27:52.498 --> 00:27:54.580]  I want to talk to the crew, I want to talk to the listeners as well.
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.782]  But right now, let's start getting into some more of these clips.
[00:27:56.782 --> 00:28:03.147]  Here is a clip where we see the real face of Little Jebby.
[00:28:04.488 --> 00:28:10.152]  I mean, these people are a pack of bank swindlers, SNL scammers, just like John McCain and the Keating Five.
[00:28:10.152 --> 00:28:13.434]  I mean, these are real mafia dons.
[00:28:13.434 --> 00:28:14.875]  These are hardcore folks.
[00:28:14.875 --> 00:28:34.288]  The Bush family under Prescott Bush, Senator Bush, literally was the head lawyer at Brown Brother Harriman, managing Nazi assets in North America, Central America, South America, and German shipping companies, and helped cover up worldwide German Nazi front companies during and after World War II.
[00:28:35.108 --> 00:28:40.731]  And then they managed that money and doled it out to Central and South American Nazis.
[00:28:40.731 --> 00:28:47.934]  You know why they have 200,000 acre ranches in South America, multiple ones, with military bases and helicopter pads?
[00:28:47.934 --> 00:28:52.136]  See, in James Bond movies, where do they live?
[00:28:52.136 --> 00:28:53.496]  This is it, folks.
[00:28:53.496 --> 00:28:55.657]  These are the real deal.
[00:28:55.657 --> 00:28:59.599]  Okay, let's go ahead and go out to break with Jeb Bush going crazy.
[00:29:00.987 --> 00:29:03.208]  This is a tough business to run for president.
[00:29:03.208 --> 00:29:03.408]  Oh, I know.
[00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:04.329]  You're a tough guy, Jeb.
[00:29:04.329 --> 00:29:04.729]  I know.
[00:29:04.729 --> 00:29:07.170]  And we need to have a leader that is real tough.
[00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:10.452]  You're never going to be President of the United States by insulting your way to the presidency.
[00:29:10.452 --> 00:29:11.052]  Well, let's see.
[00:29:11.052 --> 00:29:11.812]  I'm at 42, and you're at 3.
[00:29:11.812 --> 00:29:12.893]  So, so far, I'm doing better.
[00:29:12.893 --> 00:29:13.353]  Doesn't matter.
[00:29:13.353 --> 00:29:14.113]  Doesn't matter.
[00:29:14.113 --> 00:29:15.494]  So far, I'm doing better.
[00:29:15.494 --> 00:29:17.555]  You know, you started off over here, Jeb.
[00:29:17.555 --> 00:29:19.736]  You're moving over further and further.
[00:29:19.736 --> 00:29:21.017]  Pretty soon, you're going to be off the end.
[00:29:24.465 --> 00:29:25.105]  That's good.
[00:29:25.105 --> 00:29:26.646]  That's another time he said it.
[00:29:26.646 --> 00:29:31.328]  It's before that, where he goes, you will never be president!
[00:29:31.328 --> 00:29:33.189]  And I mean, because he's got the delegates.
[00:29:33.189 --> 00:29:37.490]  He's going to swindle everything, like he's been doing since 1938.
[00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:40.271]  By the way, the whole Nazi thing was so big, it would bring down the whole government.
[00:29:40.271 --> 00:29:41.492]  That's why they gave him a pass.
[00:29:41.492 --> 00:29:42.692]  They let him off.
[00:29:42.692 --> 00:29:43.733]  It was so big.
[00:29:43.733 --> 00:29:45.093]  It was too big to fail.
[00:29:45.093 --> 00:29:45.453]  Stay with us.
[00:29:45.453 --> 00:29:46.574]  We'll be right back on Alex Jones.
[00:29:48.177 --> 00:29:52.103]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.103 --> 00:29:54.787]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.863 --> 00:30:04.566]  A New York City principal has banned Christmas and the Pledge of Allegiance, reports EAG News.
[00:30:04.566 --> 00:30:14.012]  The new principal has also eliminated Thanksgiving, despite clear notice from the city's Department of Education allowing for holiday themes and symbols, the New York Post writes.
[00:30:14.012 --> 00:30:16.273]  We definitely can't say Christmas.
[00:30:16.273 --> 00:30:21.636]  Nothing with Christmas on it, nothing with Santa, a local PTA president told the news site.
[00:30:21.636 --> 00:30:22.777]  No angels.
[00:30:22.777 --> 00:30:27.600]  We can't even have a star because it can represent a religious system, like the Star of David.
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:36.063]  The report states that about 95% of the students at Brooklyn's PS169 are either Hispanic or Asian.
[00:30:36.063 --> 00:30:44.405]  And the assistant principal announced last month that the school is changing its holiday traditions to be sensitive to the diversity of our families.
[00:30:44.405 --> 00:30:47.946]  Not all children celebrate the same holidays, he added.
[00:30:47.946 --> 00:30:52.108]  And the Pledge of Allegiance was also ditched when the principal took office.
[00:30:52.108 --> 00:30:55.809]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:30:58.513 --> 00:31:02.035]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:31:02.035 --> 00:31:10.280]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:15.703]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:31:15.703 --> 00:31:18.245]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:31:32.858 --> 00:31:36.999]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.

[00:31:58.143 --> 00:32:05.047]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[00:32:05.047 --> 00:32:07.929]  We've always offered five months free.
[00:32:07.929 --> 00:32:13.853]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[00:32:13.853 --> 00:32:17.215]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[00:32:17.215 --> 00:32:20.577]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[00:32:20.577 --> 00:32:21.878]  All of my documentary films,
[00:32:22.358 --> 00:32:29.523]  Scores of e-books and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:29.523 --> 00:32:40.531]  You don't just get six months free when you sign up from Christmas through New Year's, you also get to share that membership with up to 20 people simultaneously using your username.
[00:32:40.531 --> 00:32:52.139]  You can also sign up for a trial month and only pay $5.95 and then 20 of you and your friends and family can watch PrisonPlanet.tv, get 20 memberships at half price, be the Paul Revere in your community.
[00:32:52.259 --> 00:33:08.913]  That's six months free when you sign up for a year at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:08.913 --> 00:33:15.058]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:20.044 --> 00:33:31.696]  Better turn me loose.
[00:33:31.696 --> 00:33:35.180]  Better set me free.
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:39.264]  Little bit better than I used to be, because I'm alive.
[00:33:39.264 --> 00:33:39.905]  Live wire!
[00:33:41.576 --> 00:33:44.056]  That's why I like Donald Trump, because he's a live wire.
[00:33:44.056 --> 00:33:45.397]  He's shaking things up.
[00:33:45.397 --> 00:33:48.337]  He's bringing up scores of topics nobody dare touch.
[00:33:48.337 --> 00:33:50.758]  He's attacking head-on political correctness.
[00:33:50.758 --> 00:33:53.178]  He's not apologizing.
[00:33:53.178 --> 00:33:55.418]  He's shaking the tree.
[00:33:55.418 --> 00:33:56.138]  Come on, baby!
[00:33:56.138 --> 00:33:58.279]  It's time to wake up.
[00:33:58.279 --> 00:33:59.559]  It's time to get aggressive.
[00:33:59.559 --> 00:34:01.119]  That's how you make a change.
[00:34:01.119 --> 00:34:05.280]  That's how you stand up to these crooks.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.521]  All day they tell you, sit down, shut up.
[00:34:08.521 --> 00:34:10.021]  Go along with the system.
[00:34:10.021 --> 00:34:10.761]  You're gonna be okay.
[00:34:12.642 --> 00:34:17.003]  Well, the system has broken its social contract with the people.
[00:34:17.003 --> 00:34:19.243]  Infowars.com is the main news website.
[00:34:19.243 --> 00:34:23.224]  PrisonPlanet.com is the main backup site.
[00:34:23.224 --> 00:34:29.486]  We're on Facebook with 3 million likes, 1 million on one of the channels, about 16 channels or 17 channels total.
[00:34:29.486 --> 00:34:34.827]  Our big YouTube channel's got about 600 million views and a million subscribers.
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:40.203]  But if you add all of our YouTubes together, just our sites alone, it's over a billion.
[00:34:40.203 --> 00:34:49.790]  You add all the others, we got about five billion views on YouTube, which is very, very, very exciting.
[00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:55.574]  You can subscribe there and see basically about 90% of our content for free.
[00:34:55.574 --> 00:35:00.758]  Or you can also decide to try to help us produce the content to give it to the dumbed-down masses.
[00:35:02.199 --> 00:35:03.459]  To wake them up.
[00:35:03.459 --> 00:35:16.644]  And now is the time to sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv and see the news live, see the special events live, see all the great e-books, read the e-books, see all of my films in HD, see archived material not available anywhere else.
[00:35:16.644 --> 00:35:19.105]  Normally $54.95 for a year.
[00:35:19.105 --> 00:35:21.906]  We give you a couple months off free when you sign up normally.
[00:35:21.906 --> 00:35:23.166]  So it's $54.95.
[00:35:23.166 --> 00:35:25.287]  But it's $36.50 right now.
[00:35:25.287 --> 00:35:27.608]  That's six months free off the regular price.
[00:35:28.749 --> 00:35:29.730]  For a year.
[00:35:49.264 --> 00:35:56.050]  Are actually tuning in and waking up and downloading the films and burning them to disk and shaving them on your hard drive.
[00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:57.391]  Because a lot of censorship's coming.
[00:35:57.391 --> 00:35:59.813]  We're battling the censorship.
[00:35:59.813 --> 00:36:03.836]  We're offensive about 80% of the time, but defensively we're archiving things.
[00:36:03.836 --> 00:36:08.961]  We're prepared to go low-tech, whatever it takes if they really clamp down on the internet.
[00:36:08.961 --> 00:36:14.345]  With Obama's kill switch that I guess Emperor Trump might use if he got into power.
[00:36:14.345 --> 00:36:17.248]  He's been clarifying that's not what he means, but he needs to clarify further.
[00:36:19.031 --> 00:36:21.693]  So, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:36:21.693 --> 00:36:24.795]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:36:24.795 --> 00:36:31.300]  Every Christmas for the 15 years we've had PrisonPlanet.TV, we've had, we're basically five months is free.
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:34.382]  This time we're doing six months free for the next year.
[00:36:34.382 --> 00:36:40.066]  36 bucks and then you can share that username with friends and family.
[00:36:40.066 --> 00:36:46.250]  Be sure it's a username that isn't for your other stuff, but obviously, probably up to 50 people and then hope 20 use it.
[00:36:47.688 --> 00:36:51.490]  But if you wake up five people off a membership, that is invaluable.
[00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:54.552]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:36:54.552 --> 00:37:01.236]  And then you're funding some of the crews, some of the cameras, some of the expenses, the bandwidth.
[00:37:01.236 --> 00:37:04.077]  Without PrisonPlanet.TV, we couldn't have built these new studios.
[00:37:04.077 --> 00:37:05.618]  We couldn't have done so much of the work.
[00:37:05.618 --> 00:37:08.960]  It's one of the key pillars that funds our operation.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.341]  And I don't really talk about it enough.
[00:37:10.341 --> 00:37:12.862]  I just say, hey, M4's Nightly News, M4's News.com.
[00:37:12.862 --> 00:37:17.245]  But there's so much more than the news, so much more than the four hours of live coverage last night.
[00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:19.530]  It's an archive.
[00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:24.452]  It's an independent media center that your funding is absolutely integral.
[00:37:24.452 --> 00:37:28.674]  And then you can finish all your Christmas shopping or holiday shopping right now.
[00:37:28.674 --> 00:37:30.314]  Go get a year membership.
[00:37:30.314 --> 00:37:34.856]  Send people the username and say, hey, Infowarsnews.com.
[00:37:34.856 --> 00:37:39.978]  See really cutting edge live reports, documentaries, special reports.
[00:37:39.978 --> 00:37:41.718]  This is really a special site.
[00:37:41.718 --> 00:37:42.999]  Here's your subscription site.
[00:37:44.465 --> 00:37:48.566]  Cost me 36 bucks, ooh, and then hopefully they'll go watch it.
[00:37:48.566 --> 00:37:50.707]  Give it to enough people, a lot of them will.
[00:37:50.707 --> 00:37:55.589]  A lot of folks just listen to the free iPhone apps or free Droid apps and they don't want to go spend the money.
[00:37:55.589 --> 00:38:01.551]  And I understand that, but if you do have the capital, you should become a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[00:38:01.551 --> 00:38:02.291]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:38:02.291 --> 00:38:04.572]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:38:04.572 --> 00:38:07.073]  Separately, if you order by Friday,
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:14.904]  At noon, we can get you your order before Christmas in the lower 48, probably Hawaii, probably Alaska.
[00:38:14.904 --> 00:38:18.326]  You need to order like right now if you're in Europe to get it before Christmas.
[00:38:18.326 --> 00:38:27.913]  Prisonplanet.tv is a gift you can give after the 18th and put the stocking, put in a card, put under the tree, email to somebody with a nice e-card, you name it.
[00:38:28.857 --> 00:38:35.219]  But continuing on, we have a bunch of specials that will end on the 18th.
[00:38:35.219 --> 00:38:40.420]  That's 20% off X2 Nascent Iodine, that's the big seller right now, that's a huge discount.
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:48.043]  The Good Halogen, the Essentials Pack, Survival Shield X2, Super Male, Super Female Vitality, Silver Bullet, 33% off and free shipping on all this.
[00:38:48.043 --> 00:38:52.444]  The Deep Cleanse Pack with Deep Cleanse, Living Defense, and Oxy Powder, 28% off.
[00:38:52.444 --> 00:38:57.526]  Winter Sun, the best vitamin D out there from our research, totally organic, under the tongue, sublingual, 15% off.
[00:38:58.806 --> 00:39:01.728]  Deep Cleanse by itself, 17% off.
[00:39:01.728 --> 00:39:04.531]  Wake Up a Friend Coffee Special with the free coffee mugs.
[00:39:04.531 --> 00:39:05.712]  That's a big discounted.
[00:39:05.712 --> 00:39:09.195]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:39:09.195 --> 00:39:12.497]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:39:12.497 --> 00:39:13.658]  Or you can simply call toll free.
[00:39:13.658 --> 00:39:14.799]  We can answer all your questions.
[00:39:14.799 --> 00:39:16.881]  888-253-3139.
[00:39:16.881 --> 00:39:27.450]  And until about six o'clock every night, you'll actually be talking to folks here in the Infowars News Center, here in the Infowars compound, as the media calls it.
[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:35.264]  But after that, it goes to a great call center we've been using for 18 years, and they pretty much have all the answers you need as well.
[00:39:35.264 --> 00:39:36.766]  But folks are like, I want to talk to Alex.
[00:39:36.766 --> 00:39:38.407]  He's like, well, he's not here.
[00:39:38.407 --> 00:39:40.729]  But that's a call center in Austin, Texas as well.
[00:39:40.729 --> 00:39:43.290]  Not in India, not in China, not in Mexico.
[00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:48.675]  Nothing against those folks, just that we're trying to have a few jobs here in the United States, like the coffee cubs are...
[00:39:49.395 --> 00:39:50.297]  I don't know.
[00:40:05.419 --> 00:40:06.639]  So, 888-253-3139.
[00:40:06.639 --> 00:40:14.061]  Okay, I want to go to some more of these clips from the debate last night.
[00:40:14.061 --> 00:40:17.721]  This is an interesting clip from Jeb Bush.
[00:40:17.721 --> 00:40:30.264]  Then we'll go to another clip that I think Rand Paul really shone with last night, and I would say this was the most powerful statement of the debate coming up, where he says, well, vote for these guys if you want World War III.
[00:40:30.264 --> 00:40:34.265]  That clip's coming up as well, but first this one.
[00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:34.845]  Governor Bush.
[00:40:35.709 --> 00:40:42.012]  You called Mr. Trump unhinged when he proposed banning non-American Muslims from the United States.
[00:40:42.012 --> 00:40:43.692]  Why is that unhinged?
[00:40:43.692 --> 00:40:48.114]  Well, first of all, we need to destroy ISIS in the caliphate.
[00:40:48.114 --> 00:40:49.615]  That should be our objective.
[00:40:49.615 --> 00:40:59.179]  The refugee issue will be solved if we destroy ISIS there, which means we need to have a no-fly zone, safe zones there for refugees, and to build a military force.
[00:40:59.179 --> 00:41:01.660]  Back it up five seconds, please.
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:04.221]  When you hear no-fly zone, that means in the south and the north.
[00:41:05.131 --> 00:41:12.958]  And on the Mediterranean to totally block out the Russians and the Syrians battling Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra and ISIS, all the same group.
[00:41:12.958 --> 00:41:14.199]  So it just sounds reasonable.
[00:41:14.199 --> 00:41:19.724]  Oh, let's knock out ISIS, who they sent in to destabilize.
[00:41:19.724 --> 00:41:23.807]  And Hillary Clinton honchoed the whole deal.
[00:41:23.807 --> 00:41:28.912]  And Trump's going after her for it, saying she killed hundreds of thousands of people in Syria and Libya, which she did, again.
[00:41:29.909 --> 00:41:32.893]  For every bad thing Trump says, he said a couple things.
[00:41:32.893 --> 00:41:35.897]  He says 15 or 20 really revolutionary things.
[00:41:35.897 --> 00:41:42.527]  That's why I'm saying I like him and I see him walk back statements that he says off the cuff when he's, you know, being a tough guy.
[00:41:44.341 --> 00:41:44.742]  I think so.
[00:42:04.261 --> 00:42:09.544]  Wolf pack, shark pack, attack that is so sexy and so cause celeb.
[00:42:09.544 --> 00:42:16.168]  Dumb move by Rand Paul to keep attacking Donald Trump last night when he's way down in the single digits.
[00:42:16.168 --> 00:42:17.689]  Ted Cruz is smart, Rand.
[00:42:17.689 --> 00:42:19.370]  The audit, look at what he's doing.
[00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:20.311]  And I like you, Rand.
[00:42:20.311 --> 00:42:21.892]  I know you're for real.
[00:42:21.892 --> 00:42:23.032]  I know you're a gentleman.
[00:42:23.032 --> 00:42:28.576]  You started taking the gloves off last night when it came to World War III and stuff and attacks on the internet.
[00:42:28.576 --> 00:42:30.137]  That was a legitimate attack on Trump.
[00:42:31.041 --> 00:42:35.082]  But, you know, saying he's a kook and a nut and all this stuff, that's what they say about you.
[00:42:35.082 --> 00:42:39.864]  I mean, they want you to, you know, come out and badmouth your father.
[00:42:39.864 --> 00:42:42.805]  I know full well some of the folks you got working for you do that.
[00:42:42.805 --> 00:42:45.226]  You know, differentiate yourself from your father.
[00:42:45.226 --> 00:42:49.227]  Your father is George Washington material, in my view.
[00:42:49.227 --> 00:42:53.868]  And you know that, and your dad brought you along, and you believe everything your dad believes.
[00:42:53.868 --> 00:42:55.609]  They don't like you because they know that, Rand.
[00:42:56.638 --> 00:42:59.220]  They know you trying to moderate's not for real.
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:00.460]  Just be yourself.
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:03.802]  And you can become president next year.
[00:43:03.802 --> 00:43:05.183]  Enough of a rant on that subject.
[00:43:05.183 --> 00:43:06.264]  Let's go back to Jeb Bush.
[00:43:08.042 --> 00:43:10.764]  ...there for refugees and to build a military force.
[00:43:10.764 --> 00:43:14.987]  We need to embed our forces, our troops, inside the Iraqi military.
[00:43:14.987 --> 00:43:16.968]  We need to arm directly the Kurds.
[00:43:16.968 --> 00:43:20.871]  And all of that has to be done in concert with the Arab nations.
[00:43:20.871 --> 00:43:26.455]  And if we're going to ban all Muslims, how are we going to get them to be part of a coalition to destroy ISIS?
[00:43:26.455 --> 00:43:29.457]  The Kurds are the greatest fighting force and our strongest allies.
[00:43:29.457 --> 00:43:29.957]  They're Muslim.
[00:43:30.774 --> 00:43:33.377]  Look, this is not a serious proposal.
[00:43:33.377 --> 00:43:42.906]  In fact, it will push the Muslim world, the Arab world, away from us at a time when we need to re-engage with them to be able to create a strategy to destroy ISIS.
[00:43:42.906 --> 00:43:50.574]  So, Donald, you know, is great at the one-liners, but he's a chaos candidate, and he'd be a chaos president.
[00:43:51.152 --> 00:43:54.494]  He would not be the commander-in-chief we need to keep our country safe.
[00:44:13.991 --> 00:44:17.154]  Which if you actually wanted to help Syria, you could argue that.
[00:44:17.154 --> 00:44:19.177]  It's still international war crime.
[00:44:19.177 --> 00:44:21.959]  You shouldn't be involved in regime changes if somebody didn't attack you.
[00:44:23.376 --> 00:44:26.397]  The globalist plan is to destabilize those countries forever.
[00:44:26.397 --> 00:44:27.497]  Make them failed states.
[00:44:27.497 --> 00:44:29.697]  Iraq, Libya, Syria, Egypt.
[00:44:29.697 --> 00:44:31.158]  That's a crime against humanity.
[00:44:31.158 --> 00:44:33.278]  And the globalists want to do that to us!
[00:44:33.278 --> 00:44:38.839]  Turning off our power plants, jacking with our families, screwing our kids up, shipping drugs into the country.
[00:44:38.839 --> 00:44:40.360]  It's the admitted plan.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:45.381]  I'm going to go to Kit Daniels, one of our Infowars.com investigative journalists and writers.
[00:44:46.221 --> 00:44:47.902]  To get his comment on the debates.
[00:44:47.902 --> 00:44:50.143]  Then we're going to go to the big Kahuna clip.
[00:44:50.143 --> 00:44:53.745]  The one that made me start loving Rand Paul again.
[00:44:53.745 --> 00:44:58.768]  I gotta tell you, when he said, you are a bunch of crazy World War III nuts.
[00:44:58.768 --> 00:45:02.630]  When they were up there, punch Putin in the nose, the Russians in the nose.
[00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:05.331]  Yeah, shoot their planes down.
[00:45:05.331 --> 00:45:07.753]  Watching these two super wimpy.
[00:45:08.942 --> 00:45:18.377]  Governor Kasich, Governor Christie, just stink of hypocrisy and fraud and overall buck-toothedness.
[00:45:18.377 --> 00:45:21.822]  I mean, they are just such slimy little interloping
[00:45:22.748 --> 00:45:27.532]  Miscreants pushing World War III and the end of our planet.
[00:45:27.532 --> 00:45:29.793]  I mean, this is psycho talk.
[00:45:29.793 --> 00:45:35.577]  Even the most psycho killers like Hitler and Stalin, who had killed people and done all sorts of exploits.
[00:45:35.577 --> 00:45:41.381]  Hitler had the Congressional Medal of Honor, Iron Cross first class folks, and second class.
[00:45:41.381 --> 00:45:43.083]  I mean, he was a war hero.
[00:45:43.083 --> 00:45:44.684]  Killed a bunch of people.
[00:45:44.684 --> 00:45:45.965]  Ran through the enemy lines.
[00:45:45.965 --> 00:45:49.067]  I mean, I'm not saying Hitler was a good guy, but he was super tough.
[00:45:49.067 --> 00:45:50.288]  Got gassed twice.
[00:45:51.803 --> 00:45:53.745]  That's why everybody was following him in the military.
[00:45:53.745 --> 00:46:00.272]  Because the guy survived going between enemy lines with messages that no one had survived as long as he did.
[00:46:00.272 --> 00:46:04.977]  He would crawl out after being nerve gassed, refuse orders, and go back to the front.
[00:46:04.977 --> 00:46:05.878]  Because he was a demon.
[00:46:05.878 --> 00:46:07.059]  He loved war.
[00:46:07.059 --> 00:46:09.862]  But the point is that
[00:46:11.837 --> 00:46:26.626]  They have totally jacked all this, where we've got weirdos, like these governors, up there shooting their mouths off about attacking Russians, and blooding their noses, and generals on TV saying we need lots of Russian body bags, when the West is encircling Russia, attacking Russia!
[00:46:26.626 --> 00:46:27.966]  We're not Nazi Germany!
[00:46:27.966 --> 00:46:30.048]  We're not Napoleonic France!
[00:46:30.048 --> 00:46:31.328]  No!
[00:46:31.328 --> 00:46:33.670]  These people are psycho crazies!
[00:46:35.213 --> 00:46:36.054]  They're nuts!
[00:46:36.054 --> 00:46:38.516]  Not even dictators shoot their mouths off like this.
[00:46:38.516 --> 00:46:40.618]  This is so beyond third world.
[00:46:40.618 --> 00:46:42.920]  This is so embarrassing in history.
[00:46:44.295 --> 00:46:46.316]  Kent Daniels, your take on the situation?
[00:46:46.316 --> 00:46:53.161]  Well, this whole debate is a microcosm to how the establishment is completely losing the narrative.
[00:46:53.161 --> 00:46:55.543]  I mean, I generally like Donald Trump.
[00:46:55.543 --> 00:47:05.110]  You know, as a libertarian, I do have some concerns about some things he says, but let's not lose focus on the fact that he's pulling the Overton window towards liberty.
[00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:11.914]  Honestly, in research and history, I've never seen anything like this since the Revolutionary War as far as the free flow of information and how
[00:47:12.995 --> 00:47:16.297]  With a super populist like Trump showing up?
[00:47:16.297 --> 00:47:16.977]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:47:16.977 --> 00:47:18.698]  The elite don't like what he's saying or doing.
[00:47:18.698 --> 00:47:22.279]  He is moving the debate way back towards 1776.
[00:47:22.279 --> 00:47:26.721]  The needle's going from 1984 to 1776 big time right now.
[00:47:26.721 --> 00:47:37.707]  Yeah, I think that's what they fear most in him being president is the fact that he is turning the tide against the establishment by controlling the narrative.
[00:47:37.707 --> 00:47:40.388]  I mean, the establishment, particularly the mainstream media,
[00:47:40.968 --> 00:47:46.272]  No matter how much they attack him, he keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
[00:47:46.272 --> 00:47:50.335]  And that is a huge blow to the establishment's control over the population.
[00:47:50.335 --> 00:48:00.823]  And that's, the mainstream media is the primary method of how they engineer consent on the world's population, the billions of people, as you and I both know, and a lot of listeners to the show both know.
[00:48:00.823 --> 00:48:07.708]  Well, to give some folks some inside intel, now that I've been spending a lot of time investigating Trump, not just through
[00:48:08.789 --> 00:48:15.350]  Some of his crew and former crew, but through some other people I know that know him, they go, listen, Donald Trump's for real.
[00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:16.531]  He's beyond a narcissist.
[00:48:16.531 --> 00:48:19.271]  He literally is so positive, so aggressive.
[00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:21.792]  He works about 18 hours a day, weekdays.
[00:48:21.792 --> 00:48:22.992]  He loves reading letters.
[00:48:22.992 --> 00:48:24.292]  He loves doing deals.
[00:48:24.292 --> 00:48:25.733]  He loves looking at blueprints.
[00:48:25.733 --> 00:48:28.293]  He loves helicoptering around, looking at his properties.
[00:48:28.293 --> 00:48:31.134]  He loves rewarding staff that's good, firing staff that's bad.
[00:48:31.974 --> 00:48:36.058]  And he really does want America to be great, and he loves to be told how great he is, too.
[00:48:36.058 --> 00:48:40.783]  And he associates himself with America and nationalism.
[00:48:40.783 --> 00:48:44.547]  And that's why I was saying, you know, George Washington was really great.
[00:48:44.547 --> 00:48:45.368]  He was super cool.
[00:48:45.368 --> 00:48:47.951]  And Trump goes, yeah, that's what they say.
[00:48:47.951 --> 00:48:49.793]  He just wanted to get back to Donald Trump being great.
[00:48:50.655 --> 00:48:54.157]  And that's not perfect, folks, but here's the deal.
[00:48:54.157 --> 00:49:00.942]  It's better than Hillary that wants to destroy this country and mount its head on the wall and bring in a stinking anti-human world government.
[00:49:00.942 --> 00:49:04.564]  That's what Bernie Sanders, that literal dirtbag, wants.
[00:49:04.564 --> 00:49:10.388]  That's what Jeb Bush, a dangerous crime lord, dangerous crime lord, if you look into his whole past.
[00:49:10.388 --> 00:49:13.130]  I mean, these are dangerous, hardcore, sinister people.
[00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:17.673]  I know my life's in danger every time I shoot my mouth off about them, because they might just pull the trigger.
[00:49:17.673 --> 00:49:20.335]  I mean, the Bushes do not play games, folks.
[00:49:21.415 --> 00:49:23.356]  Okay, they are hardcore.
[00:49:23.356 --> 00:49:28.938]  They make, you know, people like drug lords in Mexico and stuff look like wimps.
[00:49:28.938 --> 00:49:30.458]  I mean, they've taken this country over.
[00:49:30.458 --> 00:49:33.339]  They run things with the Clintons who work for them.
[00:49:33.339 --> 00:49:35.239]  Now, are the Clintons double-crossing them at this point?
[00:49:35.239 --> 00:49:36.100]  I don't know.
[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:38.380]  But they are serious.
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:42.682]  And so, Trump might end up getting elected and might be horrible.
[00:49:42.682 --> 00:49:44.642]  Probably not, though, my gut tells me.
[00:49:44.642 --> 00:49:46.283]  If we put pressure on him in a good way,
[00:49:47.525 --> 00:49:50.727]  But we know what we've got with these globalist crime lords.
[00:49:50.727 --> 00:49:52.729]  Kit Daniels.
[00:49:52.729 --> 00:49:56.171]  You remember that movie from the 1980s, A Weekend at Bernie's, I think it was called?
[00:49:56.171 --> 00:49:56.371]  Yes.
[00:49:56.371 --> 00:49:59.313]  Where they were taking around this dead body and pretending he's alive?
[00:49:59.313 --> 00:50:01.034]  That's the Jeb Bush campaign right now.
[00:50:01.034 --> 00:50:11.841]  I mean, today I get online in the coffee shop and I look at the articles and there's one, I think, The Hill that wrote that in the lead sentence, it's like, Jeb Bush won the debate.
[00:50:12.521 --> 00:50:15.204]  And then I see other articles saying kind of the same thing.
[00:50:15.204 --> 00:50:23.071]  It's almost like I have to question maybe the Bush campaign's paying off these reporters to write these articles.
[00:50:23.071 --> 00:50:25.313]  As you know, public relations.
[00:50:25.313 --> 00:50:26.934]  Sure, he's three points in most polls.
[00:50:26.934 --> 00:50:28.315]  He had some of the biggest applauses.
[00:50:28.315 --> 00:50:31.698]  They even packed that with the GOP national controlling it.
[00:50:31.698 --> 00:50:34.941]  The GOP national said, we don't care what Trump does.
[00:50:34.941 --> 00:50:36.823]  We don't care what anybody else does.
[00:50:36.823 --> 00:50:37.444]  We will deliver.
[00:50:37.944 --> 00:50:40.126]  The delegates to Jeb Bush, no matter what.
[00:50:40.126 --> 00:50:42.549]  Well, we're going to expose that and fight that.
[00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:45.892]  We're not going to wait until they try to do that on midnight, the night of the primary.
[00:50:45.892 --> 00:50:52.078]  We're going to expose it right now, you snot-nosed, fascist-collaborating rats.
[00:50:52.078 --> 00:50:54.140]  You anti-free market filth.
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:56.022]  You Rockefeller minions.

[00:54:21.321 --> 00:54:28.947]  Here is part of the incredible exchange with Christy Kasich and Rand Paul.
[00:54:28.947 --> 00:54:30.668]  And this is the most powerful exchange of the night.
[00:54:30.668 --> 00:54:33.751]  Rand Paul, I think, pretty much wins the debate.
[00:54:33.751 --> 00:54:36.053]  Trump in second place because of this statement.
[00:54:36.693 --> 00:54:37.853]  Right here about World War III.
[00:54:37.853 --> 00:54:40.815]  Remember, we're attacking Russia, blowing up Ukraine.
[00:54:40.815 --> 00:54:45.836]  Russia just responds very calmly, very lovingly, with sanctions against Turkey and stuff.
[00:54:45.836 --> 00:54:47.777]  While our leaders say, let's kill Russians.
[00:54:47.777 --> 00:54:52.719]  I mean, this is foaming at the mouth, bloodthirsty piranha behavior that you see out of ISIS.
[00:54:52.719 --> 00:54:53.039]  Here it is.
[00:54:54.107 --> 00:54:57.968]  Foreign policy, you have to know how to pick and choose.
[00:54:57.968 --> 00:55:03.090]  There's no way, if Saddam had not had weapons of mass destruction, I would have gone.
[00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:04.490]  Because I don't believe the U.S.
[00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:07.091]  should be involved directly in civil wars.
[00:55:07.091 --> 00:55:08.091]  I oppose the U.S.
[00:55:08.091 --> 00:55:09.552]  involvement in Lebanon.
[00:55:09.552 --> 00:55:12.893]  We ended up having to withdraw our Marines after our barracks were blown up.
[00:55:13.453 --> 00:55:22.544]  There's a difference between Iraq, where you have Sunni, Shia, and Kurds put together after First World War by the Western powers.
[00:55:22.544 --> 00:55:23.485]  It doesn't work.
[00:55:23.485 --> 00:55:25.567]  It needs to break up into three parts.
[00:55:25.567 --> 00:55:28.270]  And finally, you, in regard to Syria.
[00:55:29.151 --> 00:55:38.735]  Understand that Assad is an ally of Iran who wants to extend that Shia radicalism all the way across the Middle East.
[00:55:38.735 --> 00:55:39.695]  He has to go.
[00:55:39.695 --> 00:55:41.196]  And for the Russians?
[00:55:41.196 --> 00:55:43.517]  Frankly, it's time that we punch the Russians in the nose.
[00:55:43.517 --> 00:55:47.878]  They've gotten away with too much in this world and we need to stand up against them.
[00:55:47.878 --> 00:55:53.480]  Not just there, but also in Eastern Europe where they threaten some of our most precious allies.
[00:55:55.601 --> 00:55:57.863]  We have another question from Facebook.
[00:55:57.863 --> 00:56:00.404]  Listen in.
[00:56:00.404 --> 00:56:02.126]  My name is Ashley Toffol.
[00:56:02.126 --> 00:56:02.346]  Ms.
[00:56:02.346 --> 00:56:08.950]  Fiorina, in November, you said that you would not talk to Vladimir Putin after you were elected because you would be communicating from a position of weakness.
[00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:14.614]  Do you believe that it is feasible to not communicate with another world leader, and do you think that that also is a sign of weakness?
[00:56:14.614 --> 00:56:14.834]  Ms.
[00:56:14.834 --> 00:56:16.355]  Fiorina, as you know, U.S.
[00:56:16.355 --> 00:56:21.339]  and Russian warplanes are flying all over Syria right now with so many lives on the line.
[00:56:21.339 --> 00:56:24.341]  Is this a good time for the United States not to talk to Putin?
[00:56:24.841 --> 00:56:27.422]  I didn't say I would cut off all communication with Putin.
[00:56:27.422 --> 00:56:31.665]  What I said was, as President of the United States, now is not the time to talk with him.
[00:56:31.665 --> 00:56:34.286]  Reagan walked away at Reykjavik.
[00:56:34.286 --> 00:56:36.407]  There is a time and a place for everything.
[00:56:36.407 --> 00:56:40.389]  There is a time and a place for talk, and there is a time and a place for action.
[00:56:40.389 --> 00:56:41.830]  I know Vladimir Putin.
[00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:43.751]  He respects strength.
[00:56:43.751 --> 00:56:49.554]  He lied to our President's face, didn't bother to tell him about warplanes and troops going into Syria.
[00:56:50.735 --> 00:56:51.516]  He didn't lie!
[00:56:51.516 --> 00:56:52.576]  Let me shoot down Russian planes!
[00:57:07.444 --> 00:57:08.225]  New deal!
[00:57:08.225 --> 00:57:23.443]  We, the United States of America, are going to cut off the money flow, which we can do, which we don't need anyone's permission or collaboration to do, and I will not speak to him personally until we've rebuilt the sixth fleet right under his nose, rebuilt the missile defense program in Poland right under his nose.
[00:57:24.244 --> 00:57:25.844]  Is that really Caitlyn Jenner up there?
[00:57:25.844 --> 00:57:27.045]  Oh, it's so tough.
[00:57:27.045 --> 00:57:30.546]  Oh, it was great to go into Iraq and he stabilized the whole thing.
[00:57:46.211 --> 00:57:50.734]  If the U.S.
[00:57:50.734 --> 00:58:01.743]  imposed a no-fly zone over Syria and a Russian plane encroached, invaded that no-fly zone, would you be prepared to shoot down that Russian plane and risk war with Russia?
[00:58:01.743 --> 00:58:04.045]  Not only would I be prepared to do it, I would do it.
[00:58:04.045 --> 00:58:06.687]  A no-fly zone means a no-fly zone.
[00:58:06.687 --> 00:58:07.888]  Wolf, that's what it means.
[00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:11.811]  No writing in the refrigerator means no writing in the refrigerator.
[00:58:35.305 --> 00:58:35.846]  Points for that.
[00:58:35.846 --> 00:58:37.811]  The neocons are running this operation.
[00:58:37.811 --> 00:58:40.617]  We'll be back, folks, with Rand Paul's response.
[00:58:40.617 --> 00:58:42.982]  Second hour, 70 seconds away.
[00:58:42.982 --> 00:58:45.106]  GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:48.621 --> 00:58:52.143]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:58:52.143 --> 00:59:00.386]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:00.386 --> 00:59:05.788]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:59:05.788 --> 00:59:08.329]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:59:19.656 --> 00:59:21.877]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:59:21.877 --> 00:59:26.859]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:59:26.859 --> 00:59:30.141]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:59:30.141 --> 00:59:33.642]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:59:33.642 --> 00:59:35.623]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:59:35.623 --> 00:59:37.724]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:59:37.724 --> 00:59:39.725]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[00:59:51.255 --> 00:59:59.981]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:59.981 --> 01:00:00.822]  Another world.
[01:00:00.822 --> 01:00:02.163]  Another time.
[01:00:02.163 --> 01:00:02.843]  In the age of
[01:00:27.015 --> 01:00:31.657]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:31.657 --> 01:00:33.958]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[01:00:33.958 --> 01:00:36.380]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:40.802]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:40.802 --> 01:00:42.723]  The Info War has achieved liftoff.
[01:00:42.723 --> 01:00:43.883]  We'll be in orbit soon.
[01:00:43.883 --> 01:00:50.287]  Targeting enemy globalist lives with even more firepower.
[01:00:50.287 --> 01:00:53.008]  We've only just begun in the beta testing of the Resistance.
[01:00:54.508 --> 01:01:01.470]  Hacking the globalist propaganda system.
[01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:05.132]  Directing the narrative back into the reality zone.
[01:01:05.132 --> 01:01:06.732]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:01:06.732 --> 01:01:10.833]  Coming up, James O'Keefe of the Veritas Project, or Project Veritas.
[01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:16.615]  Then, Harry Dent in studio on what's really happening in the economy and more.
[01:01:16.615 --> 01:01:18.416]  House Dems push assault weapons ban.
[01:01:18.416 --> 01:01:19.376]  It's all coming up.
[01:01:19.376 --> 01:01:23.018]  German court lets off Sharia police patrol in German city.
[01:01:23.018 --> 01:01:23.858]  They're actually allowed to be
[01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:26.130]  Vigilantes.
[01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:29.731]  You're not allowed to demonstrate against them, but they're allowed to do whatever they want.
[01:01:29.731 --> 01:01:32.811]  Because they're the new shock troops of the Socialists.
[01:01:32.811 --> 01:01:34.972]  The friends of women.
[01:01:34.972 --> 01:01:41.913]  But first, let's go back to the chipmunk, excuse me, the giant gopher-like creature.
[01:01:41.913 --> 01:01:43.194]  What are those big gophers called?
[01:01:43.194 --> 01:01:47.694]  I don't mean that to be goofy how he looks, but he looks like one of those giant burrowing rodents.
[01:01:47.694 --> 01:01:49.715]  Is it a woodchuck?
[01:01:49.715 --> 01:01:50.235]  Capybara?
[01:01:51.593 --> 01:01:55.576]  Is it a, uh, what's that other one called, uh, Groundhog?
[01:01:55.576 --> 01:02:03.441]  I mean, Chris Christie is an open borders, anti-gun chump.
[01:02:03.441 --> 01:02:08.344]  And he's up here saying, I would call up, threaten Vladimir Putin, you don't fly planes in there.
[01:02:08.344 --> 01:02:13.628]  A sovereign nation's been invaded by the West for five years.
[01:02:13.628 --> 01:02:15.009]  Maybe he's in Nutria.
[01:02:15.009 --> 01:02:16.210]  All this stuff's going on.
[01:02:17.748 --> 01:02:27.498]  And the response of Governor Kasich and Governor Christie is, punch the Russians in the nose, that's a quote from Kasich, and call it Putin-threatening, we'll blow your planes up.
[01:02:27.498 --> 01:02:41.412]  They know you've already blown up Ukraine, and put fascists in, and overthrew the elected government, and blown up the power, and bombed the power plants, and all trade into Crimea will be shut off next week, the hijacked leaders.
[01:02:42.768 --> 01:02:43.809]  of Ukraine just said today.
[01:02:43.809 --> 01:02:48.431]  I mean, believe me, Russia gives speeches saying, never since World War II have we been under this attack.
[01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:49.892]  We're encircled.
[01:02:49.892 --> 01:02:51.172]  We've got the nuclear forces ready.
[01:02:51.172 --> 01:02:52.413]  We believe they may hit us first.
[01:02:52.413 --> 01:02:55.295]  They're dangerous neocons who are psychotic.
[01:02:55.295 --> 01:02:56.715]  The bunkers are being built for the public.
[01:02:56.715 --> 01:02:57.936]  Prepare.
[01:02:57.936 --> 01:02:59.697]  We just want to keep Russia from collapsing.
[01:02:59.697 --> 01:03:01.838]  We're trying our best.
[01:03:01.838 --> 01:03:06.881]  And meanwhile, our guys are bloody nose, body bags, kill the Russkies.
[01:03:06.881 --> 01:03:09.182]  I mean, Hitler didn't shoot his mouth off like that.
[01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:11.831]  It's just so unmanly.
[01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:16.516]  It's so... Even warlords who were tough stuff don't act like this.
[01:03:16.516 --> 01:03:19.479]  I mean, this is real third world general stuff.
[01:03:19.479 --> 01:03:22.221]  You know, with 14 stars on their lapels.
[01:03:22.221 --> 01:03:25.724]  These guys are a bunch of neocon chicken neck cowards.
[01:03:25.724 --> 01:03:29.328]  Let's go back to Rand Paul's devastating response.
[01:03:29.328 --> 01:03:29.968]  Governor Christie.
[01:03:31.084 --> 01:03:32.325]  If the U.S.
[01:03:32.325 --> 01:03:43.315]  imposed a no-fly zone over Syria and a Russian plane encroached, invaded that no-fly zone, would you be prepared to shoot down that Russian plane and risk war with Russia?
[01:03:43.315 --> 01:03:45.697]  Not only would I be prepared to do it, I would do it.
[01:03:45.697 --> 01:03:48.280]  A no-fly zone means a no-fly zone.
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:49.901]  Wolf, that's what it means.
[01:03:49.901 --> 01:03:50.982]  See, maybe...
[01:03:52.163 --> 01:03:55.406]  Maybe because I'm from New Jersey, I just have this kind of plain language hangout.
[01:03:55.406 --> 01:03:58.548]  But I would make very clear, I would not talk to Vladimir Putin.
[01:03:58.548 --> 01:04:00.449]  In fact, I would talk to Vladimir Putin a lot.
[01:04:00.449 --> 01:04:04.432]  And I would say to him, listen, Mr. President, there's no fly zone in Syria.
[01:04:04.432 --> 01:04:06.413]  You fly in, it applies to you.
[01:04:06.413 --> 01:04:20.803]  And yes, we would shoot down the planes of Russian pilots, if in fact they were stupid enough to think that this president was the same feckless weakling that the president we have in the Oval Office is right now.
[01:04:20.803 --> 01:04:21.364]  Senator Paul.
[01:04:24.284 --> 01:04:28.631]  Senator Paul, I want you to respond to what we just heard from Governor Christie.
[01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:33.258]  If there was a no-fly zone, you say that potentially could lead to World War III.
[01:04:33.258 --> 01:04:33.458]  Why?
[01:04:34.215 --> 01:04:38.016]  Well, I think if you're in favor of World War III, you have your candidate.
[01:04:38.016 --> 01:04:42.077]  You know, here's the thing... We're gonna come back with the rest of his response.
[01:04:42.077 --> 01:04:44.478]  Let's pay it up to Wolf Blitzer.
[01:04:44.478 --> 01:04:57.522]  The admitted Israeli Mossad operative, I'm not against Israelis or anybody, I just want you to know that Anderson Cooper's CIA, and then you've got the former head of the big Israel PAC, and a known agent, Wolf Blitzer up there.
[01:04:59.494 --> 01:05:03.715]  That's right.
[01:05:03.715 --> 01:05:05.836]  The Feds are coming to town.
[01:05:05.836 --> 01:05:09.357]  The FAA has just sent their dictate throughout the land.
[01:05:09.357 --> 01:05:16.639]  Any motorized planes heavier than a half pound, I repeat, a half pound, will have to be registered by December 21st.
[01:05:16.639 --> 01:05:21.040]  If Santa gives you one, you can't fly it outside without registering it on their list.
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:28.931]  Fail to do so, and the FAA will fine you $27,500 without due process, calling it a civil fine.
[01:05:28.931 --> 01:05:36.321]  If they come after you criminally, quarter of a million dollars and three years in jail for not registering your half pound and heavier plane.
[01:05:36.701 --> 01:05:41.987]  This regulation won't do anything to enforce the current prohibitions of flying close to airports.
[01:05:41.987 --> 01:05:45.591]  And they should be concerned if they can't protect airports from toy planes.
[01:05:45.591 --> 01:05:50.416]  Because that means they certainly can't protect airports from shoulder-fired missiles.
[01:05:50.416 --> 01:05:51.236]  And guess what?
[01:05:51.236 --> 01:05:54.480]  The jihadis won't be registering those with the FAA.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:56.102]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:05:58.524 --> 01:06:06.869]  We have been fighting this war tirelessly with you at our side, day in and day out, exposing the ludicrous lies and criminal operations of the globalists.
[01:06:06.869 --> 01:06:09.190]  And we're starting to see big effects.
[01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:11.091]  And the word is getting out.
[01:06:11.091 --> 01:06:13.172]  The globalists want to make us dependent.
[01:06:13.172 --> 01:06:16.894]  And as Napoleon famously said, an army marches on its stomach.
[01:06:16.894 --> 01:06:22.377]  Ammunition, food, and supplies form the backbone of any offensive, including the Info War.
[01:06:22.377 --> 01:06:25.339]  And our enemies admit they're losing the Info War.
[01:06:25.959 --> 01:06:29.340]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:35.843]  With this in mind, we have held strong to our principles and the decision to refuse any money from globalists or government.
[01:06:35.843 --> 01:06:42.846]  We are funding our crusade against tyranny the old-fashioned way, with pure free-market, free-will capitalism.

[01:07:55.782 --> 01:07:57.163]  Infowarslife.com
[01:08:16.391 --> 01:08:22.897]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:08:22.897 --> 01:08:25.440]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:37.030]  Huma Abedin, the admitted Muslim Brotherhood mole, but over here she can dress in fancy dresses and hang out with Hillary Clinton in the same hotel room.
[01:08:37.898 --> 01:08:40.780]  They're really good friends, and that's fine.
[01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:51.705]  But the potential First Lady, the woman who could potentially be the shadow First Lady, got caught by James O'Keefe, undercover reporter, and some pretty serious stuff.
[01:08:51.705 --> 01:08:54.487]  And then, of course, O'Keefe's got some other big breaking undercover news.
[01:08:54.487 --> 01:08:56.888]  And then he's a little under the weather today, so he's just going to do 20 minutes with us.
[01:08:56.888 --> 01:09:01.530]  He's going to come back in the new year with something potentially, and I know what it is, but I'm not going to say it.
[01:09:01.530 --> 01:09:05.973]  I appreciate him sharing it with us in confidence, as big as Acorn or bigger.
[01:09:06.835 --> 01:09:13.140]  Okay, and this is a guy that has helped blow up corrupt organizations that were getting up to four billion dollars a year in taxpayer money.
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:16.543]  He's like the Patriot Death Star to the New World Order.
[01:09:16.543 --> 01:09:17.904]  And, of course, they don't see his praises.
[01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:18.564]  They arrest him.
[01:09:18.564 --> 01:09:20.025]  They try to indict him.
[01:09:20.025 --> 01:09:22.227]  He is a true 21st century Paul Revere.
[01:09:22.227 --> 01:09:23.328]  I'm not kissing his butt, folks.
[01:09:23.328 --> 01:09:24.909]  I don't do that for very many guests.
[01:09:24.909 --> 01:09:29.013]  But James O'Keefe, I'm a big fan of him, and he's a best-selling author as well.
[01:09:29.013 --> 01:09:31.935]  You can find out more at ProjectVeritas.com.
[01:09:31.935 --> 01:09:33.176]  If you're not supporting them,
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:36.406]  You're basically aiding and abetting the globalists.
[01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:37.689]  I mean, I'm done talking.
[01:09:37.689 --> 01:09:41.841]  Let's go to a clip of this undercover report with Hillary Clinton's girl.
[01:09:41.841 --> 01:09:42.142]  Here it is.
[01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:51.657]  When we were able to catch the Vice Chairwoman after her speech, she made it clear that Hillary is all in favor of allowing Syrian refugees into the country.
[01:09:51.657 --> 01:09:55.980]  Thank you so much for addressing the Syrian refugee crisis.
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:59.582]  Because honestly, Islamophobia is rampant.
[01:09:59.582 --> 01:10:08.687]  And you have to promise me, if Hillary is elected president, she's going to do everything she can to let these Syrians in because the Republicans are doing everything they can to ban them.
[01:10:08.687 --> 01:10:11.068]  Oh, and by the way, it's not just Republicans.
[01:10:11.068 --> 01:10:12.769]  There are some Democrats who are there too.
[01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:15.691]  We need to have leadership in this.
[01:10:15.691 --> 01:10:18.553]  It is not, we cannot turn these people away.
[01:10:18.553 --> 01:10:21.756]  And I think the Syrian people know that Hillary is the answer for them too.
[01:10:21.756 --> 01:10:22.597]  You know?
[01:10:22.597 --> 01:10:23.738]  I think they know.
[01:10:23.738 --> 01:10:28.962]  We're going to be an isolationist country, turning everybody away.
[01:10:28.962 --> 01:10:30.263]  It is not okay.
[01:10:30.683 --> 01:10:36.630]  That kind of talk is music to the ears of the Syrian men we met in Athens, Greece, recently.
[01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:40.814]  They say politics makes strange bedfellows.
[01:10:40.814 --> 01:10:42.135]  I guess they are right.
[01:10:49.563 --> 01:10:56.208]  Here we found Syrian refugees looking to get to Northern Europe or to the United States by any means possible.
[01:10:56.208 --> 01:10:59.030]  Suggesting even using fake passports.
[01:10:59.030 --> 01:11:01.933]  And they are unabashed Hillary supporters.
[01:11:01.933 --> 01:11:04.615]  You know we need to travel to Germany.
[01:11:04.615 --> 01:11:06.736]  How are you going to do that?
[01:11:06.736 --> 01:11:09.939]  Maybe by a plane, by a fake passport.
[01:11:10.604 --> 01:11:16.608]  Hillary, we like Hillary Clinton if she have action to finish Syria.
[01:11:16.608 --> 01:11:18.029]  What about now?
[01:11:18.029 --> 01:11:19.250]  Do you like her?
[01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:19.430]  Who?
[01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:20.871]  Do you like her now though?
[01:11:20.871 --> 01:11:22.071]  Like what she's done so far?
[01:11:22.071 --> 01:11:24.293]  I believe maybe she can do something.
[01:11:24.293 --> 01:11:27.115]  Smile!
[01:11:27.115 --> 01:11:34.159]  Because voting ID laws are so lax in so many states, these Syrian refugees might just be able to vote for Hillary.
[01:11:34.159 --> 01:11:36.921]  If, as she supports, they can get into the United States.
[01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:39.991]  And this is the political plan.
[01:11:39.991 --> 01:11:44.433]  And then make them a protected group that can whine and complain and go around and bully people with Sharia law.
[01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:48.914]  German court lets off Sharia police patrol in major German city.
[01:11:48.914 --> 01:11:50.515]  That's BBC.
[01:11:50.515 --> 01:11:51.495]  Today.
[01:11:51.495 --> 01:11:53.056]  They can just run around, do whatever they want.
[01:11:54.269 --> 01:12:10.075]  And again, folks, the reason James O'Keefe is so amazing, he's gone through so much, he's built such an organization, he keeps really wounding the globalists grievously and their agendas, and he's a model for everybody else with investigative journalists and undercover stuff.
[01:12:10.075 --> 01:12:15.897]  I mean, I was around before James O'Keefe doing some similar things, but not with the skill, the focus, the dedication.
[01:12:15.897 --> 01:12:17.198]  He is somebody I learned from.
[01:12:18.249 --> 01:12:26.759]  And the reason I brag about it is we don't give patriots enough kudos because we need to understand the success we're all having.
[01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:28.562]  That we're bigger than the mainstream media.
[01:12:28.562 --> 01:12:32.867]  I get 20 million viewers or listeners a week now, conservatively.
[01:12:32.867 --> 01:12:33.648]  In fact, it's grown.
[01:12:34.861 --> 01:12:35.721]  Think about that.
[01:12:35.721 --> 01:12:37.102]  Think about what we're all doing together.
[01:12:37.102 --> 01:12:38.542]  We are becoming the majority.
[01:12:38.542 --> 01:12:39.382]  People are waking up.
[01:12:39.382 --> 01:12:41.703]  All right, James, I know you're under the weather, so we'll just keep you to 30 after.
[01:12:41.703 --> 01:12:43.063]  Appreciate you coming on.
[01:12:43.063 --> 01:12:45.364]  I tell you, you really got my heart racing on the news.
[01:12:45.364 --> 01:12:47.284]  You were relayed to the producer earlier.
[01:12:47.284 --> 01:12:48.445]  Can't wait till you break that.
[01:12:48.445 --> 01:12:52.726]  But break into this and then get into your other big coups that you and your crew have been carrying out.
[01:12:53.359 --> 01:12:55.602]  Yes, thank you, Alex, and thank you for the compliments.
[01:12:55.602 --> 01:12:57.404]  I'm very impressed by what you've built.
[01:12:57.404 --> 01:12:59.767]  Like I told you last time, I love the work you've done.
[01:12:59.767 --> 01:13:07.937]  About 10 years ago, going to the DMV in Texas and forcing those people, showing them 11 different forms of ID, and then they still want to take your blood.
[01:13:07.937 --> 01:13:09.739]  So that was an inspiration to me early on.
[01:13:09.739 --> 01:13:10.540]  So thank you very much.
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:11.060]  Thank you, brother.
[01:13:12.261 --> 01:13:28.293]  Yeah, this whole thing we did on the Syrians, we went to Greece and we interviewed a lot of these so-called refugees and illegal immigrants coming into Greece and some of these guys were talking to us about how much it costs to get a fake passport to get into the United States.
[01:13:28.293 --> 01:13:28.953]  One of them says $3,000, €3,000.
[01:13:31.835 --> 01:13:33.096]  To get a fake passport.
[01:13:33.096 --> 01:13:34.637]  And what they told us they were doing.
[01:13:34.637 --> 01:13:37.459]  These are people we interviewed on the street with hidden cameras.
[01:13:37.459 --> 01:13:42.883]  These are the exact same types of people that went on to France and committed the bombings.
[01:13:42.883 --> 01:13:45.064]  And they all love Hillary Clinton.
[01:13:45.064 --> 01:13:46.905]  And that's what our hidden camera exposés showed.
[01:13:48.126 --> 01:13:53.208]  In terms of Huma, we do go to the fundraisers with hidden cameras for Hillary Clinton.
[01:13:53.208 --> 01:13:54.869]  That's when we interviewed Huma.
[01:13:54.869 --> 01:14:04.793]  We also have people right now, and I'm happy to say this to you, working for Hillary Clinton that are working for Project Veritas, and we have built kind of like a
[01:14:05.333 --> 01:14:05.533]  I don't
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:33.504]  Shouldn't she be congressionally investigated, Hillary's girl, for being so blatant about this?
[01:14:33.504 --> 01:14:39.749]  And look, I'm a libertarian, so I don't get into bashing lesbians and bisexuals and people as long as they don't promote it to kids.
[01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:47.776]  But I mean, obviously it's well known that she's hooked up with Hillary, that Hillary has seen more tail than a toilet seat, quote Bill Clinton.
[01:14:47.776 --> 01:14:49.538]  And so she should just be honest about it.
[01:14:49.538 --> 01:14:51.220]  Is this going to be the first lady?
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.203]  I mean, shouldn't Hillary's potential first lady be investigated further?
[01:14:55.203 --> 01:14:57.345]  And by the way, talk about courage, James.
[01:14:57.345 --> 01:15:00.729]  You know, messing with Hillary's girl, she might really come after you.
[01:15:01.601 --> 01:15:12.850]  Well, Alex, we did launch a story back in September where we actually caught one of Hillary's attorneys in Nevada saying, just break the laws, just break the rules on voter registration.
[01:15:12.850 --> 01:15:18.795]  We caught this on tape, and this attorney, Christina Gupana is her name, she just completely disappeared.
[01:15:18.795 --> 01:15:25.461]  I mean, we could not find, I don't think she works there anymore, and nobody knows where she went.
[01:15:26.181 --> 01:15:32.043]  So it's kind of a mafia-like tactics that we have discovered in the Hillary campaign.
[01:15:32.043 --> 01:15:44.627]  In terms of fear, you know, Alex, we built an organization, we have 100,000 people that we distribute to, so I think Hillary's got to be careful about retaliating against people like me or people like you, because all it does is sort of
[01:15:49.893 --> 01:15:54.298]  I agree.
[01:15:54.298 --> 01:15:55.840]  They don't want to make us martyrs.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.001]  And that's what really freaks them out.
[01:15:57.001 --> 01:16:01.126]  She admits she's losing the info war to Congress three years ago, as you know.
[01:16:01.126 --> 01:16:02.648]  What do you expect them to do next?
[01:16:02.648 --> 01:16:03.790]  I want to get into your other big coup.
[01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:05.892]  With this Attorney General.
[01:16:05.892 --> 01:16:07.013]  I mean, they are getting mad.
[01:16:07.013 --> 01:16:12.200]  They are talking to all the think tanks openly saying, what do we do to shut down the libertarian patriot movement?
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.062]  How do we censor these folks?
[01:16:14.062 --> 01:16:18.647]  Matt Drudge, as you know, has been told by a major Supreme Court justice that they're coming for us.
[01:16:18.647 --> 01:16:20.530]  Him, you, myself and others next year.
[01:16:21.522 --> 01:16:23.984]  I saw the interview you did with Matt Drudge.
[01:16:23.984 --> 01:16:25.384]  Phenomenal scoop, by the way.
[01:16:25.384 --> 01:16:30.047]  I agree with Matt Drudge.
[01:16:30.047 --> 01:16:33.209]  This is a courageous fight.
[01:16:33.209 --> 01:16:36.311]  Project Veritas is going where no one else has ever gone before.
[01:16:36.311 --> 01:16:40.874]  We're building our own journalistic kind of intelligence gathering operation.
[01:16:40.874 --> 01:16:44.816]  We're putting people behind enemy lines with hidden cameras.
[01:16:44.816 --> 01:16:48.198]  We're going to candidate events, to fundraisers.
[01:16:48.198 --> 01:16:50.820]  We have people working for campaigns that are reporting back to us.
[01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:53.741]  How do they not shut you down?
[01:16:53.741 --> 01:16:57.542]  Maybe they will, but we're going to give it the best shot in 2016.
[01:16:57.542 --> 01:16:59.903]  And they've tried to put me in jail before, you know that.
[01:16:59.903 --> 01:17:02.004]  I've been on your program to discuss this.
[01:17:02.004 --> 01:17:04.184]  But I think we're kind of like the Death Star.
[01:17:04.184 --> 01:17:09.066]  At this point, if they shoot into us, it only makes us bigger and bolder and badder.
[01:17:09.066 --> 01:17:17.729]  And when I was one person, one man, I mean, they can shut down one guy, but they cannot shut down an army of exposers and investigators.
[01:17:18.109 --> 01:17:19.391]  And that's what we need to do.
[01:17:19.391 --> 01:17:20.512]  We need to build the Army.
[01:17:20.512 --> 01:17:28.981]  If your audience is interested in becoming a videographer or reporter, contact ProjectVeritas.com and we will equip you, we will mobilize you, we will deploy you.
[01:17:28.981 --> 01:17:32.285]  They are unable to shut down more than one man.
[01:17:33.206 --> 01:17:40.070]  Absolutely, and I intend to try to get even more reporters on staff and also get auxiliaries around the country as well, because we're not in competition.
[01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:48.075]  We are fighting for the life of this country, and I use the Death Star analogy because of the firepower blowing up some of their biggest on-the-ground frauds like Akron.
[01:17:48.075 --> 01:17:50.336]  I mean, that was a devastatingly evil organization.
[01:17:50.336 --> 01:17:53.738]  You guys literally destroyed it with the truth, or they destroyed themselves.
[01:17:54.658 --> 01:18:05.231]  But flipping back to the Star Wars analogy, it's more like you've got 100,000 X-Wings in your group, and so do we, that they can't hit us all, they can't get us all, because we're just all over the place.
[01:18:05.231 --> 01:18:12.539]  Because they didn't see a small one man or one woman fighter as a threat, and they just can't defeat us if we take action.
[01:18:12.539 --> 01:18:12.860]  It's over.
[01:18:13.646 --> 01:18:14.427]  They're deterred.
[01:18:14.427 --> 01:18:17.710]  Yeah, one thing that we found like with ACORN, ACORN rebranded itself.
[01:18:17.710 --> 01:18:19.511]  Your audience knows that ACORN was shut down.
[01:18:19.511 --> 01:18:25.116]  President Obama signed legislation to defund ACORN six years ago after our expose.
[01:18:25.116 --> 01:18:31.242]  ACORN has turned into a bunch of subgroups like Organizing for America and a lot of these groups are scared.
[01:18:31.242 --> 01:18:34.065]  They're petrified that there are going to be people like us
[01:18:34.665 --> 01:18:38.871]  Going in there with cameras exposing it, and they're ultimately deterred.
[01:18:38.871 --> 01:18:40.594]  They're deterred from doing the fraud.
[01:18:40.594 --> 01:18:44.259]  But, what happens is they take the fraud and they go behind closed doors.
[01:18:44.259 --> 01:18:45.641]  It makes it tougher to uncover.
[01:18:45.641 --> 01:18:49.987]  So we actually, at Veritas, we have to increase our sophistication.
[01:18:50.467 --> 01:18:59.314]  And Alex, I want to come on your show in January because we have a huge story coming out about the topic is education in the country.
[01:18:59.314 --> 01:19:03.257]  And it's a topic that your audience is going to want to hear about.
[01:19:03.257 --> 01:19:05.879]  We had to build online aliases.
[01:19:05.879 --> 01:19:11.303]  We had to go way behind closed doors, build relationships with a lot of these federal officials over months.
[01:19:11.303 --> 01:19:15.767]  This is what we have to do to expose them because they take their fraud deeper and deeper and deeper.
[01:19:15.767 --> 01:19:17.909]  They don't do it in the open anymore.
[01:19:17.909 --> 01:19:19.350]  So we got to go behind closed doors.
[01:19:19.710 --> 01:19:27.071]  Well, you are using intelligence agency tactics when you use good-looking women and stuff, and you've got people pulling their wedding rings off and spilling their guts.
[01:19:27.071 --> 01:19:32.812]  I mean, you're doing some stuff that they would use against the mob or whatever, or the CIA would use.
[01:19:32.812 --> 01:19:38.233]  I've really got to hand it to you, just the innovation, the boldness.
[01:19:38.233 --> 01:19:46.915]  But I guess, let me guess, as they've persecuted you more and you've just become more successful, has that made you more aggressive, their attempts at intimidation?
[01:19:47.979 --> 01:19:49.519]  I think it's just made us smarter.
[01:19:49.519 --> 01:19:52.600]  You know, they say what doesn't jail you makes you smarter.
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:57.901]  But I do really believe in the Death Star analogy, like Eric Holder.
[01:19:57.901 --> 01:20:03.863]  You know, we got offered Eric Holder's ballot because there's no photo ID, so you can get offered ballots.
[01:20:03.863 --> 01:20:06.884]  And after that happened, Holder did not come after us.
[01:20:06.884 --> 01:20:08.724]  Instead, he kind of backed off.
[01:20:08.724 --> 01:20:16.366]  So I think applying the tactics of Saul Linsky, personalizing the target, learning from intelligence agencies, we actually hired a former
[01:20:17.026 --> 01:20:27.093]  A former CIA case officer to teach us about the tactics that they do and learning these techniques and using them to investigate and expose fraud.
[01:20:27.093 --> 01:20:28.294]  I think it's made us bolder.
[01:20:28.294 --> 01:20:29.935]  I think it's made us learn more.
[01:20:29.935 --> 01:20:33.838]  Yeah, see, I didn't know that you'd been trained by a former CIA, but that's clear.
[01:20:33.838 --> 01:20:37.540]  What you guys are doing is really aggressive and it is the model, folks.
[01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:40.222]  Everybody's got to get your book that breaks all this down.
[01:20:40.222 --> 01:20:43.565]  I mean, I've told my crew this, we need to do this as well.
[01:20:44.365 --> 01:20:51.568]  I've kind of not cracked the whip because it's such a sophisticated thing you're doing, but overall it's just about doing it, you get better and better.
[01:20:51.568 --> 01:20:55.049]  Let's shift gears before we get to your final story and let you go here in about five minutes.
[01:20:55.049 --> 01:21:01.851]  Let's talk about, again, James O'Keefe, ProjectVeritas.com, joining us, breaking one of the biggest stories ever early next year.
[01:21:01.851 --> 01:21:04.532]  He says he'll join us as soon as that comes out.
[01:21:04.532 --> 01:21:05.813]  What about the culture war?
[01:21:05.813 --> 01:21:11.275]  I mean, we know so many prominent Hollywood people who've been silent their whole lives, like Kurt Russell this week.
[01:21:11.835 --> 01:21:16.461]  Coming out and saying, I'm pro-gun, and here's why, so eloquently.
[01:21:16.461 --> 01:21:22.350]  I don't know what the system's going to do as everybody really turns on political correctness.
[01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:23.972]  I mean, even South Park is.
[01:21:23.972 --> 01:21:26.736]  This has got to be really, really worrying them.
[01:21:27.625 --> 01:21:40.570]  Well, I mean, one of the things that, in terms of the culture wars, The Good Wife on CBS, I don't know if people watch that show, but it's, it's, all the investigations I do, they mentioned our work about two weeks ago on The Good Wife.
[01:21:40.570 --> 01:21:43.011]  CBS, the screenwriter, they said,
[01:21:43.311 --> 01:21:51.235]  They did a whole show about undercover videos on Planned Parenthood and abortion things, and they brought my name up and said, this is disgusting.
[01:21:51.235 --> 01:21:52.736]  This is like James O'Keefe.
[01:21:52.736 --> 01:21:56.658]  I must have gotten 200 text messages in the course of two minutes.
[01:21:56.658 --> 01:22:00.420]  People I've never even talked to in years suddenly paying attention.
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:03.161]  So we've got to somehow take our work and make it mainstream.
[01:22:03.161 --> 01:22:05.582]  We've got to force people to pay attention to what we do.
[01:22:05.582 --> 01:22:10.004]  Now on the subject of guns, now what we did, and this is something that we're going to continue doing.
[01:22:10.004 --> 01:22:10.925]  I think it's very important.
[01:22:11.505 --> 01:22:15.750]  The Attorney General of Maryland, we went undercover and we met this guy.
[01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:17.432]  Yes, he took his wedding ring off.
[01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:18.273]  This guy's married.
[01:22:18.273 --> 01:22:20.996]  He was supposed to be a taxpayer-funded conference.
[01:22:20.996 --> 01:22:28.444]  He tries to, he starts hitting on my female undercover reporter and divulging all this information and saying, now here's the truth.
[01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:30.005]  I really want to ban all guns.
[01:22:30.586 --> 01:22:32.048]  I want to ban all guns.
[01:22:32.048 --> 01:22:33.730]  I don't want you to tell anybody I said that.
[01:22:33.730 --> 01:22:35.011]  I want that to be off the record.
[01:22:35.011 --> 01:22:39.076]  This is the Deputy Attorney General of Maryland saying this.
[01:22:39.076 --> 01:22:41.859]  So I'm going to continue to do that.
[01:22:41.859 --> 01:22:47.366]  Usually I don't say this publicly, but I'm going to try to catch all these officials in all these states.
[01:22:47.366 --> 01:22:50.610]  What exactly do they intend to do about the Second Amendment?
[01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:54.411]  And for some reason, I don't know why they don't shoot a shout from the rooftops.
[01:22:54.411 --> 01:22:56.732]  If they want to ban all guns, let's hear it.
[01:22:56.732 --> 01:22:58.572]  That's one of the things that I'm going to be doing.
[01:22:58.572 --> 01:23:00.172]  That's what we did in Maryland.
[01:23:00.172 --> 01:23:01.453]  Got this guy in hot water.
[01:23:01.453 --> 01:23:02.773]  He takes off his wedding ring.
[01:23:02.773 --> 01:23:09.435]  He starts hitting on our undercover reporter, telling her exactly what he intends to do with your gun rights in the state of Maryland.
[01:23:09.835 --> 01:23:16.957]  And that's how you pick up Democrat weirdo socialist women who he thought she was, as you tell them, I want to destroy America, I want the guns, I'm a tyrant, I'm filth.
[01:23:16.957 --> 01:23:19.058]  They just go, oh my gosh, let's go.
[01:23:19.058 --> 01:23:21.598]  But sadly enough, that's not who they were dealing with.
[01:23:21.598 --> 01:23:24.899]  After you're gone, I'm going to come back and play a clip of that video.
[01:23:24.899 --> 01:23:34.902]  Maryland Attorney General's Office Sex Guns and Egregious Ethical Violations, just one of the latest bombshell videos that he released just last week.
[01:23:35.342 --> 01:23:39.848]  Now, speaking of, you go after Akron, they're getting three to five billion a year.
[01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:42.652]  You're going to multiple offices where they're like, you got underage prostitutes?
[01:23:42.652 --> 01:23:43.914]  No big deal.
[01:23:43.914 --> 01:23:45.355]  I mean, just showing the incredible...
[01:23:46.807 --> 01:23:49.728]  Seediness and mafioso behavior of these organizations.
[01:23:49.728 --> 01:23:54.929]  But as you said, they then just break into Battleground Texas and metastasize.
[01:23:54.929 --> 01:24:04.071]  Speaking of Kurt Russell, it reminds me of The Thing, where you chop off one part of it and it just grows tentacles and ends up running away.
[01:24:04.071 --> 01:24:09.032]  Now still, that ends up hurting it, but how do you track down every piece of it?
[01:24:09.032 --> 01:24:12.593]  How does Kurt Russell take this out and flamethrow it?
[01:24:12.593 --> 01:24:14.113]  How do we deal with this, James O'Keefe?
[01:24:15.912 --> 01:24:18.955]  I haven't seen that one in a couple years.
[01:24:18.955 --> 01:24:22.077]  I think the price of liberty, Alex, is eternal vigilance.
[01:24:22.077 --> 01:24:25.260]  A lot of people I speak with think, James, you know, they're just gonna
[01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:38.242]  Metamorphosis into something else are going to change into something else.
[01:24:38.242 --> 01:24:40.685]  Look, you got to keep going.
[01:24:40.685 --> 01:24:48.732]  If something is effective, if something takes an organization down or exposes the truth, you got to keep exposing it.
[01:24:48.732 --> 01:24:52.235]  Acorn is going to turn into different subgroups that lost their federal funding.
[01:24:52.235 --> 01:25:00.042]  And if we catch one government official and they lose their job, which is what's going to happen in January again, we call them scouts.
[01:25:00.743 --> 01:25:05.414]  If we can get one person to lose their job, then we need to do that a hundred times.
[01:25:05.414 --> 01:25:11.226]  And I guarantee you that after the hundredth person loses their job, maybe our people in Congress
[01:25:23.223 --> 01:25:26.927]  I agree with you.
[01:25:26.927 --> 01:25:31.232]  Then we have to hunt down every piece of it and then prosecute them for the crimes they've committed.
[01:25:31.232 --> 01:25:33.935]  So, I mean, isn't local government, states taking action?
[01:25:33.935 --> 01:25:36.138]  Isn't that our Kurt Russell on the ground with the flamethrower?
[01:25:37.492 --> 01:25:44.034]  Alex, I don't believe that our current court system or our current political leadership is going to solve the problems our country faces.
[01:25:44.034 --> 01:25:46.214]  I think this is a movement-driven thing.
[01:25:46.214 --> 01:25:48.395]  I think it's a people-driven thing.
[01:25:48.395 --> 01:25:49.655]  It's a bottom-up thing.
[01:25:49.655 --> 01:25:54.797]  I do not look to courts or to Congress to actually solve the problem.
[01:25:54.797 --> 01:25:56.257]  You've got to outrage the people.
[01:25:56.257 --> 01:25:58.778]  That's happening right now in our politics.
[01:25:58.778 --> 01:26:02.239]  It's happening with some of the support that Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.
[01:26:02.239 --> 01:26:03.439]  People are very frustrated.
[01:26:03.999 --> 01:26:17.166]  So I think we've got to feed people information, allow them to be outraged about what's happening, and if the groups change and they turn into different... I'm laughing at what you have on the screen there.
[01:26:17.166 --> 01:26:23.008]  If they turn into different alien forms and Organizing for America and Snakeheads, just keep going after them.
[01:26:23.008 --> 01:26:24.269]  That's what you do.
[01:26:24.269 --> 01:26:24.809]  Yeah.
[01:26:24.809 --> 01:26:25.970]  Yeah.
[01:26:25.970 --> 01:26:27.971]  I mean, Kurt Russell knows how to take them out.
[01:26:30.239 --> 01:26:33.922]  We can learn a few things from the CIA and Kurt Russell.
[01:26:33.922 --> 01:26:43.191]  I encourage your audience, I know that we don't like Saul Alinsky and we don't like some of the CIA tactics, but we should also learn from some of the things they do.
[01:26:43.191 --> 01:26:49.116]  In the old days the CIA used this against mass murdering communists and it's all very fair if it's applied right.
[01:26:49.116 --> 01:26:52.299]  It's the new stuff that's dirty, funding ISIS and stuff, proxy wars.
[01:26:52.299 --> 01:26:55.963]  It's good to legally and lawfully be an investigative journalist, infiltrate,
[01:26:56.763 --> 01:27:00.847]  Uh, you know, use sex operatives as long as they're not offering sex for info.
[01:27:00.847 --> 01:27:02.428]  Uh, and just let these guys spill their guts.
[01:27:02.428 --> 01:27:06.172]  These are enemies of the Republic, in my view, and we gotta take the gloves off.
[01:27:06.172 --> 01:27:07.393]  We are at war.
[01:27:07.393 --> 01:27:10.556]  We are at war, and we don't take prisoners.
[01:27:10.556 --> 01:27:19.304]  Now, we're journalists, so we're not funding ISIS and doing some of the dirty things you mentioned, but this is a war for the sake of our country, and it's
[01:27:20.104 --> 01:27:21.626]  That's why I'm building what I'm building.
[01:27:21.626 --> 01:27:24.329]  I'm building stuff I can't even talk to you about.
[01:27:24.329 --> 01:27:27.192]  But I am very excited to come on your program in January.
[01:27:27.192 --> 01:27:33.539]  I want you to be one of the first people to have this story about our education system, our federal education system.
[01:27:33.539 --> 01:27:35.201]  It's going to be bombshell.
[01:27:35.201 --> 01:27:37.163]  And I just encourage everyone to have hope.
[01:27:38.224 --> 01:27:39.505]  I don't think so.
[01:27:57.433 --> 01:27:58.354]  We're good to go.
[01:28:19.754 --> 01:28:29.462]  When I see stuff like these folks infiltrating the abortion clinics and others, and then I talk to these folks, they are using you and our model, but especially you and others, as the way to do it.
[01:28:29.462 --> 01:28:33.805]  And I know those are just more X-Wings out there to attack the Death Star.
[01:28:33.805 --> 01:28:41.992]  It's got to give you a good feeling to know that we're all in this together, more people are coming to the floor, and that means it makes us even harder to beat.
[01:28:42.875 --> 01:28:46.980]  Yeah, I mean David Daleiden who did the story on Center for Medical Progress.
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:29:00.436]  I met him a couple years ago in Sacramento and it took him, by the way, three years of commitment to infiltrate Planned Parenthood and expose what was happening with selling fetal tissue.
[01:29:01.036 --> 01:29:02.137]  That's a lot of commitment.
[01:29:02.137 --> 01:29:03.578]  Three years on one issue.
[01:29:03.578 --> 01:29:04.799]  That's what it's going to take.
[01:29:04.799 --> 01:29:07.421]  It's going to take a couple brave people.
[01:29:07.421 --> 01:29:14.947]  And if federal officials, if government officials are lying, stealing, cheating from the taxpayer, we will make you an unwilling internet sensation.
[01:29:14.947 --> 01:29:16.669]  We will make you famous.
[01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:17.469]  Well done.
[01:29:17.469 --> 01:29:18.090]  Well done.
[01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:21.831]  Well, ProjectVeritas.com, James O'Keefe, you're awesome.
[01:29:21.831 --> 01:29:26.373]  Have a wonderful Christmas, and we look forward in a few weeks, when you break the bombshell, to have you back with us.
[01:29:26.373 --> 01:29:27.333]  Thank you, sir.
[01:29:27.333 --> 01:29:28.054]  Thank you.
[01:29:28.054 --> 01:29:30.955]  Folks, put his book back on screen for TV viewers, if we can.
[01:29:30.955 --> 01:29:35.416]  It's available at ProjectVeritas.com and bookstores all over the place.
[01:29:35.416 --> 01:29:36.217]  You want the model.
[01:29:36.217 --> 01:29:37.717]  It's Breakthrough.
[01:29:37.717 --> 01:29:42.219]  Our guerrilla war to expose fraud and save democracy or this republic.
[01:29:42.219 --> 01:29:43.560]  James O'Keefe.
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:45.000]  It's a blueprint for victory.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.421]  He's a true info warrior.
[01:29:46.421 --> 01:29:46.901]  Stay with us.
[01:29:48.154 --> 01:29:51.164]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.164 --> 01:29:54.776]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.082 --> 01:30:08.724]  The LAPD and private security are targeting random people with stop and frisk searches on public sidewalks before the premiere of Star Wars The Force Awakens.
[01:30:08.724 --> 01:30:15.906]  Police have also installed metal detectors on the sidewalks near the famous TCL Chinese Theater in Hollywood, California.
[01:30:15.906 --> 01:30:20.007]  Someone took to Twitter to post a picture of a Wookiee having his back searched.
[01:30:20.007 --> 01:30:24.889]  The caption reads, security will be tight for the latest hashtag Star Wars premiere tonight.
[01:30:24.889 --> 01:30:26.469]  Metal detectors have been set up.
[01:30:27.069 --> 01:30:38.157]  TMZ reported, LAPD and private security officers are already blanketing several square blocks around the famed Chinese theater where the Force Awakens event is going down.
[01:30:38.157 --> 01:30:44.321]  We've learned anyone strolling through the area could be searched, frisked, and even wanted with metal detectors.
[01:30:44.321 --> 01:30:52.266]  In other words, even people not associated with the event who are simply passing through a public area are subject to a warrantless search.
[01:30:52.266 --> 01:30:55.809]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[01:30:58.587 --> 01:31:02.368]  Soon Christmas would have come and gone, and with it, 2015.

[01:31:58.531 --> 01:32:02.215]  Secret 12 InfoWarsLife's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:32:02.495 --> 01:32:08.797]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:32:08.797 --> 01:32:16.080]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:24.863]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[01:32:25.183 --> 01:32:31.347]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:32:31.347 --> 01:32:36.191]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:32:36.191 --> 01:32:39.773]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:32:39.773 --> 01:32:41.675]  No needles, no injections.
[01:32:41.675 --> 01:32:43.336]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:32:43.336 --> 01:32:44.517]  Try it for yourself.
[01:32:44.517 --> 01:32:46.838]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[01:33:09.031 --> 01:33:10.491]  You want answers?
[01:33:10.491 --> 01:33:11.892]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:11.892 --> 01:33:16.654]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:23.789 --> 01:33:27.250]  We're in a war, folks.
[01:33:27.250 --> 01:33:30.611]  Globalist mean business.
[01:33:30.611 --> 01:33:34.112]  Target maximum firepower.
[01:33:34.112 --> 01:33:36.972]  We've reached the Globalist CNN Center.
[01:33:36.972 --> 01:33:38.073]  Bye-bye.
[01:33:38.073 --> 01:33:45.954]  I'm afraid your new order isn't going too well.
[01:33:51.616 --> 01:33:53.457]  Gotta love it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:53.457 --> 01:33:58.699]  Another one of the great intros the crew has put together with all the Star Wars fever hitting.
[01:33:58.699 --> 01:33:59.839]  But it comes out Friday.
[01:33:59.839 --> 01:34:03.421]  I need to hijack some of the Star Wars propaganda.
[01:34:03.421 --> 01:34:04.261]  I haven't done that yet.
[01:34:04.261 --> 01:34:05.862]  I've been so busy fighting the New World Order.
[01:34:05.862 --> 01:34:10.364]  But I'd say 75-80% of the war is in entertainment.
[01:34:10.364 --> 01:34:13.585]  That's where the real brainwashing's going on.
[01:34:13.585 --> 01:34:17.506]  And so, Jakari Jackson and Kit Daniels did get tickets for the first day.
[01:34:17.506 --> 01:34:18.547]  They will have a report.
[01:34:19.653 --> 01:34:22.815]  But I want to send one of our professional camera people out to help them.
[01:34:22.815 --> 01:34:23.536]  They work so hard.
[01:34:23.536 --> 01:34:24.637]  They'll go shoot it themselves.
[01:34:24.637 --> 01:34:26.338]  And Shikari's a pretty good camera guy.
[01:34:26.338 --> 01:34:26.838]  So is Kip.
[01:34:26.838 --> 01:34:31.582]  We should send somebody out with them so they can shoot it HD when they come out.
[01:34:31.582 --> 01:34:33.743]  And really, you know, do a great job.
[01:34:33.743 --> 01:34:36.345]  And maybe talk to some of the folks on the street about what they thought about it.
[01:34:36.345 --> 01:34:37.346]  You know, do a whole production.
[01:34:37.346 --> 01:34:43.551]  Because, you know, a first review, InfoWars first review of it will be the type of video that gets a million views.
[01:34:44.611 --> 01:34:52.194]  When we think about that, it's like mainstream media to get a million views will have like a $50,000 budget.
[01:34:52.194 --> 01:34:58.537]  The budgets on the Ventura TV show were like, you know, $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 a piece.
[01:34:58.537 --> 01:35:05.880]  Other shows, I've been on Discovery Channel shows with $3 million to $4 million price tags per episode.
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:09.342]  Five of them were shot with me as the main guy.
[01:35:09.342 --> 01:35:13.604]  It didn't make me look bad with an award-winning director, but Joe Bellinger,
[01:35:14.616 --> 01:35:20.780]  You know the guy that made some kind of monster and Brothers Keeper and you know he's won like Academy Awards and stuff I think, hadn't he?
[01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:23.261]  Yeah, Brothers Keeper.
[01:35:23.261 --> 01:35:28.405]  And he just said, no Alex, you're goofy, you do some weird stuff, but I actually like you and I didn't make you look bad.
[01:35:28.405 --> 01:35:29.966]  Will you come back and look stupid?
[01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:38.874]  And I said, uh, I've never done that before, but you're so nice, I'm not going to do anything fake, but how about we bring in some people that attack me to make it, quote, more fair?
[01:35:38.874 --> 01:35:39.755]  And he goes, I already did that.
[01:35:39.755 --> 01:35:40.815]  He goes, you know what?
[01:35:40.815 --> 01:35:49.940]  He called back a day later and he goes, you were nice to say you might debate some enemies or something, but, um, I'm not going to violate my integrity or your integrity, so I'm not going to re-edit it.
[01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:53.942]  And, uh, they just shelved.
[01:35:53.942 --> 01:35:58.645]  I think he said, I think it was over $16 million in production.
[01:36:00.094 --> 01:36:00.595]  16 mil.
[01:36:00.595 --> 01:36:01.737]  Never seen.
[01:36:01.737 --> 01:36:02.337]  16 mil.
[01:36:02.337 --> 01:36:03.018]  Never seen.
[01:36:03.018 --> 01:36:04.741]  How's that?
[01:36:14.502 --> 01:36:17.984]  That's how big the control is, boys and girls.
[01:36:17.984 --> 01:36:33.816]  And then many other examples of where I've been in LA, I've been out there, except for this year and a couple years, because I mean, I used to go out there, A&E, Discovery Channel, History Channel, you name it, I've met with them all.
[01:36:33.816 --> 01:36:42.122]  And they wanted me to act like a clown on my own reality TV show and have all this fake infighting and all this garbage.
[01:36:43.311 --> 01:36:47.574]  Even before Duck Dynasty was around, they wanted basically a show like that.
[01:36:47.574 --> 01:36:54.520]  I was pitched, and then you'll go out to your family ranch, and then drink, and then shoot guns, and act like a hillbilly, and then you'll come back to your office and argue with people.
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:56.261]  And I just said, you know what?
[01:36:56.261 --> 01:36:56.842]  I don't want to do it.
[01:36:56.842 --> 01:37:04.548]  And then they come back and go, okay, we weren't offering you any money at first, but it would make you famous, and then there'd be merchandise.
[01:37:04.548 --> 01:37:06.410]  Do you want a million dollars?
[01:37:06.410 --> 01:37:09.432]  And I'd say, nah, a million dollars?
[01:37:09.432 --> 01:37:11.414]  You don't want a million dollars?
[01:37:11.414 --> 01:37:12.615]  No, I don't want your million dollars.
[01:37:14.056 --> 01:37:17.678]  Go roll it up, put some tobacco in it, smoke it.
[01:37:17.678 --> 01:37:19.298]  And now I don't even respond to it.
[01:37:19.298 --> 01:37:22.800]  I used to get, every week, reality TV show offers.
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:26.402]  And then many times, on paper, with contracts.
[01:37:26.402 --> 01:37:33.505]  In fact, I was offered other famous people's TV shows, basically, when they didn't want to do them anymore, and I didn't do it, because the direction things were going.
[01:37:33.505 --> 01:37:35.306]  I mean, Chupacabras, the rest of it.
[01:37:35.306 --> 01:37:37.066]  And I'm not knocking folks that do that.
[01:37:37.066 --> 01:37:37.987]  It's just, that ain't me.
[01:37:39.079 --> 01:37:44.701]  See, I admire folks like George Norrie because he took a show that was all space aliens and chupacabras and made it more about the New World Order.
[01:37:44.701 --> 01:37:49.544]  He reformed Coast to Coast about 80% and I don't blame him for keeping some of the fun stuff in there.
[01:37:49.544 --> 01:37:53.365]  That's why his show is pretty much number two or number one.
[01:37:53.365 --> 01:37:54.406]  600 radio stations.
[01:37:54.406 --> 01:38:06.711]  In Austin, Texas, his show, every book that comes out, every rating series that we see in the news, has upwards of 65% of the total radio terrestrial audience in Austin.
[01:38:08.257 --> 01:38:10.219]  And it's like that all across the country, 50 to 60%.
[01:38:10.219 --> 01:38:15.324]  Some places, I mean, AM, FM, everything.
[01:38:15.324 --> 01:38:18.828]  He'll have 60% of them tuning in or more.
[01:38:18.828 --> 01:38:20.269]  That's not selling out.
[01:38:20.269 --> 01:38:26.215]  He came in, took the show over, made it better, made it bigger, covered a lot of real hardcore topics.
[01:38:26.215 --> 01:38:31.080]  What mainstream TVs wanted me to do is go do shows where
[01:38:32.363 --> 01:38:37.045]  I cover, you know, ghosts and goblins and vampires most of the time.
[01:38:37.045 --> 01:38:45.430]  And then mix it in with this harp-controlling vampires or, you know, are there underground cities under New York with aliens in them?
[01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:53.474]  And then Rachel Maddow comes out when I've never done those shows and says that I believe there are giant aliens under the UN building.
[01:38:53.474 --> 01:38:59.997]  I know for a fact that they brought Donald Trump news articles and said, look what you did going on his show.
[01:38:59.997 --> 01:39:01.058]  And Trump looked at it and said,
[01:39:02.230 --> 01:39:03.931]  There's no clip or quote here.
[01:39:03.931 --> 01:39:06.414]  What, they just make it up like they do me?
[01:39:06.414 --> 01:39:07.114]  Decision was made.
[01:39:07.114 --> 01:39:07.675]  I went on a show.
[01:39:07.675 --> 01:39:10.597]  I happen to know all that went on.
[01:39:10.597 --> 01:39:12.259]  I'm just going to stop right there.
[01:39:12.259 --> 01:39:14.400]  See, Trump's smart, folks.
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:15.742]  He says give $5 million to the vets.
[01:39:15.742 --> 01:39:17.483]  They say he wants $5 million for himself.
[01:39:17.483 --> 01:39:18.624]  They lie.
[01:39:18.624 --> 01:39:19.625]  They twist.
[01:39:19.625 --> 01:39:20.746]  They deceive.
[01:39:20.746 --> 01:39:22.648]  They think we're idiots.
[01:39:22.648 --> 01:39:27.192]  And so when I tell you about my personal experiences, it's not bragging that I've been offered all these TV shows.
[01:39:27.192 --> 01:39:28.573]  It's not bragging about all this.
[01:39:32.423 --> 01:39:35.174]  It's that I have witnessed it.
[01:39:35.174 --> 01:39:37.422]  I have seen it with my own eyeballs.
[01:39:40.157 --> 01:39:51.022]  I've seen major directors spend eight months on producing a five-part TV show with the highest budget ever for Discovery Channel, and they just killed it.
[01:39:51.022 --> 01:40:03.768]  And I've sat in the meetings where they go, six, seven years ago, the hottest thing is gun shows, and we're pitching nothing but gun shows on History Discovery, because a lot of these are production companies that do it for everybody else, you know, that make it.
[01:40:03.768 --> 01:40:06.969]  And they go, Alex, we want you to have several gun shows.
[01:40:06.969 --> 01:40:07.790]  Alex, we want, um,
[01:40:10.413 --> 01:40:12.277]  You to bring us people for gun shows?
[01:40:12.277 --> 01:40:14.161]  And then they call back and go, no, you're right.
[01:40:14.161 --> 01:40:16.186]  There's an order to kill all the gun shows.
[01:40:16.186 --> 01:40:18.752]  And the next season, you're going to see almost all the shows canceled.
[01:40:18.752 --> 01:40:20.515]  And you saw that happen three years ago.
[01:40:24.042 --> 01:40:27.704]  You know, they had that whole hit piece on Jesse James, who I happen to know pretty well.
[01:40:27.704 --> 01:40:29.085]  He lives here in Austin, Texas.
[01:40:29.085 --> 01:40:30.105]  And I can find no fault with him.
[01:40:30.105 --> 01:40:31.126]  He's a really nice guy.
[01:40:31.126 --> 01:40:32.186]  Pro-Second Amendment.
[01:40:32.186 --> 01:40:35.168]  A lot of that Sandra Bullock stuff pretty much wasn't even true.
[01:40:35.168 --> 01:40:36.689]  It was just a stunt for her movie.
[01:40:36.689 --> 01:40:38.249]  And he's never attacked Sandra Bullock to me.
[01:40:38.249 --> 01:40:40.190]  I just know the inside baseball from Hollywood.
[01:40:40.190 --> 01:40:41.251]  Then I met him, got to know him.
[01:40:41.251 --> 01:40:42.712]  He used to live next door to me.
[01:40:42.712 --> 01:40:43.112]  Or I did.
[01:40:43.112 --> 01:40:44.713]  I don't live there anymore.
[01:40:44.713 --> 01:40:48.655]  And just got to know him.
[01:40:48.655 --> 01:40:49.595]  And I'll leave it at that.
[01:40:49.595 --> 01:40:50.416]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:40:51.792 --> 01:41:04.215]  And he's certainly not perfect, nobody is, but he's grown up a lot, so have I. And just some of the inside baseball stuff he was telling me about, a lot of what they did to him in the media is because he's more libertarian or conservative.
[01:41:04.215 --> 01:41:05.236]  And that's just what they do, folks.
[01:41:05.236 --> 01:41:11.297]  They take little things that are true, and they twist them, and they exaggerate them, and they expand them.
[01:41:11.297 --> 01:41:12.638]  Jesse James is a nice guy.
[01:41:12.638 --> 01:41:14.018]  Lance Armstrong is a total jerk.
[01:41:15.563 --> 01:41:20.865]  And so, you know, those are just the dichotomies that I personally have experienced myself.
[01:41:20.865 --> 01:41:25.806]  So, if you've experienced, you know, people always demonize me to my friends.
[01:41:25.806 --> 01:41:29.068]  I'm good friends with a prominent old Texas family, the Steiners.
[01:41:29.068 --> 01:41:31.608]  And, you know, they're all part of the Johnson family, you name it, as well.
[01:41:31.608 --> 01:41:33.069]  But they're really good friends.
[01:41:33.069 --> 01:41:36.890]  And, you know, sometimes people, politicians, come over to their house for dinner will bash me.
[01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:39.571]  And then Bobby Steiner will say, do you know Alex Jones?
[01:41:39.571 --> 01:41:41.692]  Because I've known him since he was in high school with my boys.
[01:41:42.401 --> 01:41:43.722]  That's not the Alex Jones I know.
[01:41:43.722 --> 01:41:49.184]  See, it's about knowing somebody, or actually seeing them do it.
[01:41:49.184 --> 01:41:52.105]  I didn't say there's WASP under the Capitol, or under the UN building.
[01:41:52.105 --> 01:41:53.706]  I didn't say there wasn't a moon landing.
[01:41:53.706 --> 01:41:56.007]  I didn't say George Bush put bombs in the buildings.
[01:41:56.007 --> 01:42:01.089]  I said there were bombs in Building 7, and I interviewed the emergency manager who they killed two weeks later!
[01:42:01.089 --> 01:42:02.229]  Barry Jennings!
[01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:03.310]  Murdered him!
[01:42:03.310 --> 01:42:04.550]  After he's on my show!
[01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:05.091]  That's real!
[01:42:06.047 --> 01:42:18.792]  I don't know who did it, I don't know exactly what's going on, but let me tell you, we're getting lied to, folks, and our government's funding the very same Al-Qaeda trash to go kill moderate Christian nations and others, and then bringing them here!
[01:42:18.792 --> 01:42:23.874]  And that's crazy!
[01:42:23.874 --> 01:42:31.317]  And it's just refreshing, and I'm not saying Trump's perfect, and he might go down the road and not like me or something, I don't care, it's not about who Donald Trump likes me.
[01:42:31.317 --> 01:42:32.658]  It's that it's refreshing
[01:42:34.909 --> 01:42:40.731]  That he was told by a bunch of his people, do not go on the Alex Jones Show, and he did.
[01:42:40.731 --> 01:42:43.372]  Because Donald Trump runs Donald Trump.
[01:42:43.372 --> 01:42:45.893]  And I've seen it for myself firsthand.
[01:42:45.893 --> 01:42:47.193]  I've experienced it.
[01:42:47.193 --> 01:42:59.738]  And in a nation of cowards, and a nation of people that bend over to the wind, in a nation of people that just go along to get along and are easily intimidated, it is very refreshing to see his confidence.
[01:42:59.738 --> 01:43:03.279]  And he's not arrogant, he is extremely confident.
[01:43:04.622 --> 01:43:07.903]  He's committed.
[01:43:07.903 --> 01:43:10.804]  And he's done a lot of things that I'm sure he wish he would have done differently.
[01:43:10.804 --> 01:43:12.365]  And he may end up betraying us.
[01:43:12.365 --> 01:43:13.725]  I don't know.
[01:43:13.725 --> 01:43:19.447]  All I know is he's in the arena being attacked by all this scum and I'm not standing against Donald Trump.
[01:43:19.447 --> 01:43:20.248]  It's that simple.
[01:43:20.248 --> 01:43:23.289]  I'm going to watch and I'm going to see and I'm going to do what I always do.
[01:43:23.289 --> 01:43:26.810]  I'm going to tell you what the facts show and what my gut tells me.
[01:43:26.810 --> 01:43:32.112]  And my gut tells me that they might kill Donald Trump.
[01:43:35.373 --> 01:43:37.575]  That's what my gut tells me.
[01:43:37.575 --> 01:43:41.297]  When I saw Jeb Bush repeatedly say, you will not be president.
[01:43:41.297 --> 01:43:44.239]  One time he said it with just such hate.
[01:43:44.239 --> 01:43:46.481]  And his eyes fired up and you saw the real Jeb Bush.
[01:43:46.481 --> 01:43:48.142]  That's a scary guy right there.
[01:43:48.142 --> 01:43:50.363]  You know why I badmouth the Bushes so bad and run them down?
[01:43:50.363 --> 01:43:53.866]  I mean, Bush W is not even that bad from my intel.
[01:43:53.866 --> 01:43:55.407]  It's the other ones.
[01:43:55.407 --> 01:43:59.990]  That's why it was such a big joke that the firstborn dud, as his dad sees him, ended up being the president.
[01:44:01.809 --> 01:44:03.771]  Marvin and Jeb and all of them.
[01:44:03.771 --> 01:44:06.273]  I mean, you talk about a pack of wolves.
[01:44:06.273 --> 01:44:08.956]  You talk about a pack of dangerous men.
[01:44:08.956 --> 01:44:12.199]  They're it, baby.
[01:44:12.199 --> 01:44:14.541]  Third generation Nazi collaborators.
[01:44:14.541 --> 01:44:16.443]  Now, fourth generation.
[01:44:16.443 --> 01:44:18.805]  And folks, the media always misconstrues.
[01:44:18.805 --> 01:44:23.369]  I'm not saying we face a Nazi conspiracy.
[01:44:23.369 --> 01:44:26.532]  The Nazis looted Europe.
[01:44:26.532 --> 01:44:26.913]  Northern
[01:44:28.459 --> 01:44:34.825]  Western, Southern, Central, and Russia.
[01:44:34.825 --> 01:44:37.627]  They looted the Middle East and North Africa.
[01:44:37.627 --> 01:44:41.490]  The Russians never got back but a small percentage of it.
[01:44:41.490 --> 01:44:46.655]  It got handed over to the West in a deal to get the Nazis out to the United States.
[01:44:46.655 --> 01:44:48.817]  And that's all come out.
[01:44:48.817 --> 01:44:51.059]  But see, I was told about this when I was a child.
[01:44:52.284 --> 01:44:56.406]  Because I had family in Texas that witnessed it, and I'm going to leave it right there.
[01:44:56.406 --> 01:44:59.108]  But let me tell you something, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:59.108 --> 01:45:03.330]  There's a lot of rabbit holes around here, and what you think's going on isn't what's going on.
[01:45:03.330 --> 01:45:12.475]  When you see the Bushes, their wealth is reportedly in the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions.
[01:45:12.475 --> 01:45:15.496]  It may even be over a trillion.
[01:45:15.496 --> 01:45:19.779]  They're one of the richest families in the world, as the managers.
[01:45:21.286 --> 01:45:32.275]  Of rattles, of just caves of gold and diamonds and rubies and paintings and technology and networks.
[01:45:32.275 --> 01:45:34.497]  They took over the whole Nazi network that was worldwide.
[01:45:34.497 --> 01:45:37.520]  Because Skull and Bones should have.
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:45.366]  You don't just think that the Bush's got let in to run the Nazi operation in the 30's and tried to overthrow the President.
[01:45:45.366 --> 01:45:47.368]  I mean, it was all in the McCormick-Dickstein Committee hearings.
[01:45:48.686 --> 01:45:50.406]  You don't just think.
[01:45:50.406 --> 01:45:52.027]  They were just led into this for a reason.
[01:45:52.027 --> 01:46:03.309]  In 1832, wealthy American sons of tycoons, three of them, were sent to Germany to go to college.
[01:46:03.309 --> 01:46:09.651]  The Russell Trust and others came back and set up Skull and Bones, temple number 322.
[01:46:09.651 --> 01:46:10.331]  And they admit
[01:46:11.442 --> 01:46:12.303]  They've been broken into.
[01:46:12.303 --> 01:46:13.123]  It's come out.
[01:46:13.123 --> 01:46:14.765]  Members of its families have gone public.
[01:46:14.765 --> 01:46:16.106]  Charlotte Isserby's dad was a member.
[01:46:16.106 --> 01:46:20.609]  She leaked it all to Anthony Sutton, the Congressional Investigation.
[01:46:20.609 --> 01:46:28.816]  That it is an Illuminati German death cult that worships Lucifer.
[01:46:28.816 --> 01:46:30.658]  Period.
[01:46:30.658 --> 01:46:33.000]  Period.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.081]  And that's why the Germans came over.
[01:46:35.081 --> 01:46:37.103]  They were an extension of that, a death cult.
[01:46:37.103 --> 01:46:39.185]  You know, black uniforms, skull and crossbones on their hats.
[01:46:40.638 --> 01:46:43.338]  And that's why they worked with Prescott.
[01:46:43.338 --> 01:46:45.359]  Skull and bones, baby!
[01:46:45.359 --> 01:46:48.199]  Skull and bones!
[01:46:48.199 --> 01:46:49.940]  They don't play games.
[01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:53.020]  They mean business.
[01:46:53.020 --> 01:46:57.741]  But Schmedley Butler, two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner, he'd been pretty right-wing.
[01:46:57.741 --> 01:47:01.942]  They came to him, and he'd overthrown more than seven countries himself.
[01:47:01.942 --> 01:47:04.362]  They came to him, and they said, we want you to overthrow the U.S.
[01:47:04.362 --> 01:47:04.782]  government.
[01:47:04.782 --> 01:47:07.483]  We've got a 500,000-man army right now.
[01:47:07.483 --> 01:47:09.483]  We've got more than 15 governors ready to go.
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:16.167]  And he went and reported the whole thing to the federal government and the FBI and the rest of them who were infiltrated themselves.
[01:47:16.167 --> 01:47:18.029]  There was an internal battle.
[01:47:18.029 --> 01:47:20.512]  Some folks got killed behind the scenes.
[01:47:20.512 --> 01:47:24.818]  They came to the bushes and they said, you're too big to bring down with all this.
[01:47:24.818 --> 01:47:28.122]  You're going to flip as double agents and give us everything the Germans have got.
[01:47:28.122 --> 01:47:28.462]  This is in 1937.
[01:47:30.623 --> 01:47:31.784]  You're going to keep playing ball.
[01:47:31.784 --> 01:47:33.425]  The Kennedys got rolled by the Nazis.
[01:47:33.425 --> 01:47:35.166]  They got put on the payroll too.
[01:47:35.166 --> 01:47:36.367]  They told Jack Kennedy.
[01:47:36.367 --> 01:47:38.188]  They told RFK.
[01:47:38.188 --> 01:47:40.690]  They told Daddy Kennedy.
[01:47:40.690 --> 01:47:46.033]  They told the oldest son, Joe Jr., who blew up piloting drones.
[01:47:46.033 --> 01:47:47.834]  They'd have a plane behind him with the drones below.
[01:47:47.834 --> 01:47:50.236]  He got blown up by the Germans.
[01:47:50.236 --> 01:47:53.178]  There was a group of Messerschmitts, if you look it up.
[01:47:53.178 --> 01:47:55.139]  And they said, you're going to set up the Germans.
[01:47:55.139 --> 01:47:55.680]  This is great.
[01:47:56.500 --> 01:48:03.146]  So they didn't make a big thing about it till the end of World War II, so they could do a double infiltration of the Nazis.
[01:48:03.146 --> 01:48:08.631]  But then the Bush's got all those goodies for themselves, so Trump needs to get into all this.
[01:48:08.631 --> 01:48:14.976]  And we're going to air on the Nightly News tonight an excerpt of a film I made, martial law on the subject, but update it.
[01:48:14.976 --> 01:48:16.958]  I'm going to do a Facebook mentions after the show today as well.
[01:48:18.507 --> 01:48:28.795]  Where I go over all of this for folks, just so you understand what we're really dealing with here instead of being a bunch of morons.
[01:48:28.795 --> 01:48:36.360]  But when you look at Jeb Bush, you're talking super evil.
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:39.843]  Super evil.
[01:48:39.843 --> 01:48:43.926]  And he thinks that they're not going to let Trump win.
[01:48:43.926 --> 01:48:44.967]  He thinks they're going to
[01:48:47.955 --> 01:48:51.237]  Steal the delegates and have a broker convention.
[01:48:51.237 --> 01:48:53.818]  And I think it's up to us to decide whether that's going to happen or not.
[01:48:53.818 --> 01:49:02.863]  When we come back, I want to play a clip of this Maryland Attorney General's office, sex, guns, and egregious ethical violations we talked about with O'Keefe earlier.
[01:49:02.863 --> 01:49:06.585]  Before we go to break, I've completely committed.
[01:49:06.585 --> 01:49:10.567]  Many days I'm exhausted up here on air and I just get angry and bowl through it like I'm doing right now.
[01:49:12.455 --> 01:49:15.797]  And it's spiritually, at a gut level, not fun to mess with these people.
[01:49:15.797 --> 01:49:23.022]  You know, my base instincts, my animal instincts, my worldly instincts, my fleshly instincts say, hey man, don't mess with these people.
[01:49:23.022 --> 01:49:25.324]  But my spirit says, you're going to do it, you're going to go all the way.
[01:49:25.324 --> 01:49:27.985]  So, I want to be clear.
[01:49:27.985 --> 01:49:29.326]  My spirit's not afraid at all.
[01:49:29.326 --> 01:49:30.667]  My flesh is.
[01:49:30.667 --> 01:49:32.028]  But you know what?
[01:49:32.028 --> 01:49:33.789]  There's a reason flesh is weak.
[01:49:33.789 --> 01:49:35.771]  And the spirit's strong and unbreakable.
[01:49:35.771 --> 01:49:40.174]  Because my spirit, before it was put in my mother's gut and in my body,
[01:49:41.135 --> 01:49:44.136]  Was forged by the creator of the universe, and so was yours.
[01:49:44.136 --> 01:49:45.856]  You're gonna decide which side you're gonna join.
[01:49:45.856 --> 01:49:48.117]  You're gonna let the flesh scare you into joining the devil?
[01:49:48.117 --> 01:49:53.219]  Because once you realize it's just flesh, it's gonna fail anyways.
[01:49:53.219 --> 01:49:55.379]  My fear flips to the other side, and I just sit there.
[01:49:55.379 --> 01:49:57.180]  I don't have a death wish, but I'll be honest with you.
[01:49:57.180 --> 01:49:59.340]  I just say, hey, you wanna martyr me?
[01:49:59.340 --> 01:50:01.901]  You just go right ahead and do it.
[01:50:01.901 --> 01:50:07.783]  I just hope you're successful, if you actually are successful, and I'm not in some wheelchair from the neck down paralyzed.
[01:50:10.148 --> 01:50:11.829]  People say, don't let them know your fears.
[01:50:11.829 --> 01:50:13.851]  Hell, they already know my fears.
[01:50:13.851 --> 01:50:15.352]  The enemy knows exactly who I am.
[01:50:15.352 --> 01:50:17.534]  They know I'm for real.
[01:50:17.534 --> 01:50:20.957]  And they were expecting organic responses like this to come up from the grassroots.
[01:50:22.090 --> 01:50:23.771]  And you look where it came from.
[01:50:23.771 --> 01:50:25.172]  Isn't it fitting?
[01:50:25.172 --> 01:50:28.153]  But it's coming from all over the country and all over the world as well.
[01:50:28.153 --> 01:50:29.474]  And more is coming.
[01:50:29.474 --> 01:50:32.395]  I've always known I'm just the first big wave.
[01:50:32.395 --> 01:50:35.216]  Other waves came before me, but we're the first big wave.
[01:50:35.216 --> 01:50:38.378]  And the enemy knows the tidal waves are coming.
[01:50:38.378 --> 01:50:40.079]  Tidal waves are coming.
[01:50:40.079 --> 01:50:43.300]  Waves so big they can't even see the tops of them.
[01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:45.582]  And they're gonna wreck this world government forever.
[01:50:46.522 --> 01:50:51.208]  They won't be able to find a piece of it like Atlantis when the god of this universe is done.
[01:50:51.208 --> 01:50:54.152]  The god of this world is not a god at all.
[01:50:54.152 --> 01:50:55.774]  He's fallen and he's risen.
[01:50:58.308 --> 01:50:59.668]  Are you prepared to bug out?
[01:50:59.668 --> 01:51:07.510]  Infidel Body Armor and an Army Ranger have produced a high-speed DVD and book to show you how to drive in combat, patrol, and how to survive in combat.

[01:51:57.950 --> 01:52:08.853]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?

[01:52:45.854 --> 01:52:48.316]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[01:53:27.185 --> 01:53:30.246]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:53:30.246 --> 01:53:32.887]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:53:32.887 --> 01:53:33.627]  Croix River.
[01:53:33.627 --> 01:53:35.848]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:53:35.848 --> 01:53:38.809]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:53:38.809 --> 01:53:39.689]  His excuse?
[01:53:39.689 --> 01:53:41.029]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:53:41.029 --> 01:53:42.630]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:53:42.630 --> 01:53:48.391]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[01:54:04.312 --> 01:54:08.897]  Central, we're live with one of my great anchors or investigative journalists hosting The Fourth Hour.
[01:54:08.897 --> 01:54:11.759]  Today, it's David Knight.
[01:54:11.759 --> 01:54:15.363]  I'll be here on Thursday right through to the weekend.
[01:54:15.363 --> 01:54:19.947]  I may have some family business to attend to on Friday, so it may be Paul Watson or David Knight.
[01:54:19.947 --> 01:54:21.349]  We'll see.
[01:54:21.349 --> 01:54:24.972]  But I'll be live right through to Christmas Eve next week.
[01:54:24.972 --> 01:54:26.554]  Christmas Day will be a retransmission.
[01:54:29.522 --> 01:54:31.523]  I want to do this Project Veritas investigation.
[01:54:31.523 --> 01:54:39.248]  Then I want to get back to the full clip of Rand Paul saying we don't want World War III and really showing some of the most sane statements there and acting very presidential.
[01:54:39.248 --> 01:54:43.350]  So I want to say I'm impressed with Rand Paul being more aggressive.
[01:54:43.350 --> 01:54:44.931]  Very excited about that.
[01:54:44.931 --> 01:54:47.953]  We do have a guest coming in studio as well.
[01:54:47.953 --> 01:54:50.114]  Perry Dent on the economy and a lot more.
[01:54:50.114 --> 01:54:51.695]  So look forward to that in the next hour.
[01:54:51.695 --> 01:54:57.779]  Before I play this clip though from James O'Keefe, we are offering free shipping through the 18th.
[01:54:59.414 --> 01:55:02.058]  That's Friday.

[01:56:00.919 --> 01:56:02.961]  I mean, it's just so important.
[01:56:02.961 --> 01:56:04.422]  I want to thank you all for what you've done.
[01:56:04.422 --> 01:56:08.965]  We'll continue to continue the course and expand what we're doing if the funds come in.
[01:56:08.965 --> 01:56:14.890]  You know, I'm giving a bunch of the crew that I can little raises, little bonuses for Christmas.
[01:56:14.890 --> 01:56:19.514]  That'll continue if we continue to be able to get the funds and we'll get more crew.
[01:56:19.514 --> 01:56:25.439]  But I've got to be very judicious about what I do because a lot of other big talk show hosts have tried to expand
[01:56:26.775 --> 01:56:29.759]  Like up in North Texas that moved down here to Texas, which is fine.
[01:56:29.759 --> 01:56:32.462]  You know, the word is, are not doing too well.
[01:56:32.462 --> 01:56:33.804]  In fact, it's not word.
[01:56:33.804 --> 01:56:37.970]  I have the inside baseball on TV networks and channels and other things.
[01:56:37.970 --> 01:56:42.235]  And I admire folks that try to expand in the face of what's going on.
[01:56:42.235 --> 01:56:44.038]  It's hard to do, though.
[01:56:44.038 --> 01:56:44.578]  And we're doing it.
[01:56:45.569 --> 01:56:46.971]  Slow and easy wins the race.
[01:56:46.971 --> 01:56:51.796]  Over 21 years, though, it's kind of getting big here, and now we're facing down the barrel of the globalists.
[01:56:51.796 --> 01:56:53.698]  That's why we need your prayers and support more than ever.
[01:56:53.698 --> 01:57:04.171]  And why I have such solidarity and kinship with people like Matt Drudge or James O'Keefe or Joseph Farah or countless others, because let me tell you, we're staring down the barrel of propaganda and violence and intimidation.
[01:57:05.094 --> 01:57:07.476]  We don't have any, like, cool state secrets.
[01:57:07.476 --> 01:57:10.098]  I just told you the biggest thing that's going on right now.
[01:57:10.098 --> 01:57:10.859]  That's not public.
[01:57:10.859 --> 01:57:13.601]  There's some people that don't, but that's not public.
[01:57:28.951 --> 01:57:29.612]  This is in a hotel room.
[01:57:29.612 --> 01:57:31.033]  See, that's kind of cool.
[01:57:31.033 --> 01:57:33.455]  The thing I just told you about, you know, that's not public.
[01:57:33.455 --> 01:57:33.855]  What?
[01:57:33.855 --> 01:57:35.616]  The EPA suit.
[01:57:35.616 --> 01:57:38.138]  EPA suits, coming out from guns, it's not public?
[01:57:38.138 --> 01:57:43.343]  It would be really bad if somebody found out before the middle of the week.
[01:57:43.343 --> 01:57:45.324]  Look at this guy taking his clothes off.
[01:57:45.324 --> 01:57:47.266]  Project Veritas Presents.
[01:57:47.266 --> 01:57:49.488]  Look at that great time lapse.
[01:57:49.488 --> 01:57:50.548]  Oh my gosh.
[01:57:50.548 --> 01:57:51.849]  CIA tactics, folks.
[01:58:00.533 --> 01:58:04.674]  Gloves are off, cupcakes!
[01:58:04.674 --> 01:58:06.235]  It's always Warren, the CIA, and others.
[01:58:06.235 --> 01:58:08.395]  I mean, all you snot-nosed Ivy League people.
[01:58:08.395 --> 01:58:10.236]  This is a two-way street.
[01:58:10.236 --> 01:58:14.417]  You claim you work for the CIA, you actually work for a bunch of foreign banks, and we're coming back for the country.
[01:58:14.417 --> 01:58:18.218]  Now she's telling them he's Project Veritas.
[01:58:21.244 --> 01:58:25.926]  Our journalist met the Deputy Attorney General of Maryland here at NYU School of Law.
[01:58:25.926 --> 01:58:27.907]  Again, that video is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:58:27.907 --> 01:58:29.168]  It was up there last week.
[01:58:29.168 --> 01:58:33.150]  I'm going to repost it right now on InfoWars.com so you can share it.
[01:58:33.150 --> 01:58:37.212]  And the article about Trump exposing that the Bushes protected the middle class.
[01:58:37.212 --> 01:58:38.033]  Pretty big video.
[01:58:38.033 --> 01:58:40.634]  Get that at InfoWars.com and hammer it out.
[01:58:40.634 --> 01:58:42.555]  You're a weapon system.
[01:58:42.555 --> 01:58:44.156]  Don't wait around for a shooting war.
[01:58:44.156 --> 01:58:45.837]  Savage the enemy now!
[01:58:45.837 --> 01:58:47.477]  Crush them with InfoWars!
[01:58:47.477 --> 01:58:48.138]  Savage them!
[01:58:48.678 --> 01:58:55.885]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.
[01:58:55.885 --> 01:59:05.575]  At InfoWarsLife, our mission is to bring you the highest quality, purest, cleanest, effective colloidal silver on the market today for the lowest price available.

[01:59:44.370 --> 01:59:45.911]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:01.809 --> 02:00:05.390]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:10.032]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:10.032 --> 02:00:10.892]  We are back live.
[02:00:31.886 --> 02:00:58.300]  Finish up with the World War III clip after Kasich and Christie call for punching the Russians in the nose, shooting down their planes, threatening Putin, and then the response of Rand Paul, and then a clip that I want to spend more time on, but we've got a guest coming in studio, that's from Michael Sabat's show in a congressional hearing on C-SPAN, where the Yazidi tribe has been talking about what al-Qaeda does, sex-slaving little girls and then eating them.
[02:00:59.350 --> 02:01:00.210]  They admit they do this.
[02:01:00.210 --> 02:01:01.631]  They make videos about it.
[02:01:01.631 --> 02:01:02.211]  Eating hearts.
[02:01:02.211 --> 02:01:02.951]  They love it.
[02:01:02.951 --> 02:01:06.332]  This is who our government wants to let into the country and who they're allied with.
[02:01:06.332 --> 02:01:09.413]  And that whole deck of cards is coming down right now.
[02:01:09.413 --> 02:01:13.894]  So right now, let's go ahead and go to the World War 3 comment.
[02:01:13.894 --> 02:01:18.515]  If there was a no-fly zone, you say that potentially could lead to World War 3.
[02:01:18.515 --> 02:01:19.495]  Why?
[02:01:19.495 --> 02:01:23.277]  Well, I think if you're in favor of World War 3, you have your candidate.
[02:01:23.277 --> 02:01:24.717]  You know, here's the thing.
[02:01:27.597 --> 02:01:39.623]  My goodness, what we want in a leader is someone with judgment, not someone who is so reckless as to stand on the stage and say, yes, I'm jumping up and down, I'm going to shoot down Russian planes.
[02:01:39.623 --> 02:01:41.964]  Russia already flies in that airspace.
[02:01:41.964 --> 02:01:49.008]  It may or may not be something we're in love with the fact that they're there, but they were invited by Iraq and by Syria to fly in that airspace.
[02:01:49.528 --> 02:01:59.412]  And so, if we announce we're going to have a no-fly zone, and others have said this, Hillary Clinton's also for it, it is a recipe for disaster, it's a recipe for World War III.
[02:01:59.412 --> 02:02:08.935]  We need to confront Russia from a position of strength, but we don't need to confront Russia from a point of recklessness that would lead to war.
[02:02:08.935 --> 02:02:13.437]  This is something, this type of judgment, you know, it's having that kind of judgment.
[02:02:13.437 --> 02:02:15.778]  Who you would appoint and how you're going to conduct affairs.
[02:02:16.518 --> 02:02:18.900]  Almost a perfect answer, but I've studied the situation.
[02:02:18.900 --> 02:02:20.441]  Russia's not confronting anybody.
[02:02:20.441 --> 02:02:21.722]  They're trying to go free market.
[02:02:21.722 --> 02:02:23.204]  They kicked the oligarchs out.
[02:02:23.204 --> 02:02:24.304]  They got two military bases.
[02:02:24.304 --> 02:02:25.685]  We got 200.
[02:02:25.685 --> 02:02:27.327]  They're not messing with anybody.
[02:02:27.327 --> 02:02:33.892]  The bully is punching them in the nose and then saying that the 100-pound kid, the 200-pound bully's beating up has done something.
[02:02:34.844 --> 02:02:36.585]  It's just not happening.
[02:02:36.585 --> 02:02:42.627]  We're a hijacked country, now an empire, running around committing war crimes, and it has to stop.
[02:02:42.627 --> 02:02:46.629]  And these fat chicken hawks are, I'm just sorry, shooting their mouths off.
[02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:49.450]  I guarantee you those guys are cowardly punks.
[02:02:49.450 --> 02:02:54.913]  Because nobody that really knows what's going on, or ever been involved in any real violence, likes to shoot their mouths off about it.
[02:02:54.913 --> 02:03:02.696]  Now speaking of violence, let's talk about the Globalist Proxy Army, sent in by NATO and Saudi Arabia and others, and what they're up to when they get your women.
[02:03:02.696 --> 02:03:04.117]  Whether it's in Africa or the Middle East,
[02:03:04.757 --> 02:03:07.097]  Thousands of young Yazidi women, girls, and even children.
[02:03:34.349 --> 02:03:40.270]  Who, as I speak, have been enslaved and forced into sexual slavery.
[02:03:40.270 --> 02:03:46.232]  These girls are subjected to daily, multiple rapes by ISIS monisters.
[02:03:46.232 --> 02:03:57.315]  According to many escaped women and girls whom I talked to in Northern Iraq, the abducted GSD, most women and children number over 7,000.
[02:03:59.196 --> 02:04:13.842]  Some of those women and girls have had to watch seven, eight and nine year old children bleed to death before their eyes after being raped by ISIS militia multiple times a day.
[02:04:13.842 --> 02:04:16.763]  I know his English isn't as good as that of Barack Obama.
[02:04:16.763 --> 02:04:19.244]  I realize he's not as charming.
[02:04:19.244 --> 02:04:21.365]  But listen to clip four.
[02:04:21.365 --> 02:04:22.646]  He speaks better English.
[02:04:23.604 --> 02:04:27.107]  Those children were torn from them by ISIS.
[02:04:27.107 --> 02:04:42.879]  These same mothers came to plead for the return of their children, only to be informed that they, the mothers, had been fed the flesh of their own children by ISIS.
[02:04:42.879 --> 02:04:45.361]  Children murdered... I'm already on a break.
[02:04:45.361 --> 02:04:49.844]  They kidnap girls as young as 7, they rape them by the hundreds, make money off of it.
[02:04:49.844 --> 02:04:53.047]  The ones they can't sex sell, they cook.
[02:04:54.663 --> 02:04:56.517]  I mean, this is who our government backs, folks.
[02:04:58.641 --> 02:05:04.343]  A New York City principal has banned Christmas and the Pledge of Allegiance, reports EAG News.
[02:05:04.343 --> 02:05:13.786]  The new principal has also eliminated Thanksgiving, despite clear notice from the city's Department of Education allowing for holiday themes and symbols, the New York Post writes.
[02:05:13.786 --> 02:05:16.066]  We definitely can't say Christmas.
[02:05:16.066 --> 02:05:21.408]  Nothing with Christmas on it, nothing with Santa, a local PTA president told the news site.
[02:05:21.408 --> 02:05:22.548]  No angels.
[02:05:22.548 --> 02:05:27.370]  We can't even have a star because it can represent a religious system, like the Star of David.
[02:05:28.010 --> 02:05:35.855]  The report states that about 95% of the students at Brooklyn's PS169 are either Hispanic or Asian.
[02:05:35.855 --> 02:05:44.180]  And the assistant principal announced last month that the school is changing its holiday traditions to be sensitive to the diversity of our families.
[02:05:44.180 --> 02:05:47.742]  Not all children celebrate the same holidays, he added.
[02:05:47.742 --> 02:05:51.905]  And the Pledge of Allegiance was also ditched when the principal took office.
[02:05:51.905 --> 02:05:55.607]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[02:05:58.359 --> 02:06:01.840]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:10.102]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:06:10.102 --> 02:06:15.503]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:07:43.954 --> 02:07:44.554]  Big Brother.
[02:07:44.554 --> 02:07:45.335]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:45.335 --> 02:07:46.055]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:12.691 --> 02:08:14.575]  You want answers?
[02:08:14.575 --> 02:08:16.518]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:16.518 --> 02:08:22.910]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:59.057 --> 02:09:06.240]  I'm about 30 seconds late getting on air here because I was so busy talking to Harry Dent of harrydent.com.
[02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:09.722]  And he's here in studio with us in Austin, Texas.
[02:09:09.722 --> 02:09:16.085]  We called up wanting to get him on the show and his secretary or whatever said, oh well he's out of town, he's in Austin, Texas.
[02:09:16.085 --> 02:09:18.306]  We said, well bingo, let's get him in studio.
[02:09:18.306 --> 02:09:20.347]  So he's here for the rest of the hour.
[02:09:20.347 --> 02:09:24.148]  We'll try to get him to pop in or tape something for the nightly news as well.
[02:09:24.148 --> 02:09:27.030]  But in the next 10 minutes or so, we're supposed to hear
[02:09:27.870 --> 02:09:34.356]  Well, there's going to be a rate hike today or not, and that's why it's so great to have him here in studio.
[02:09:34.356 --> 02:09:38.700]  He's the author of The Demographic Cliff and the editor of the free newsletter Economy and Markets.
[02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:39.921]  He's the founder of Dent Research.
[02:09:39.921 --> 02:09:53.514]  He was one of the senior folks over at Maine Capital, and I'm not going to go over all of his business degrees from Harvard Business School and the rest of it, but he's worked for top Fortune 100 companies, and he's been one of the most accurate predictors of
[02:09:54.214 --> 02:09:57.138]  Long-term, mid-term and short-term trends.
[02:09:57.138 --> 02:09:57.338]  U.S.
[02:09:57.338 --> 02:09:59.100]  stocks come off high.
[02:09:59.100 --> 02:10:01.903]  Fed finally lifts key interest rate from near zero.
[02:10:01.903 --> 02:10:03.465]  It just came out seconds ago.
[02:10:03.465 --> 02:10:05.527]  Guys, can you print that from the AP?
[02:10:05.527 --> 02:10:08.531]  The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates.
[02:10:09.031 --> 02:10:19.233]  After seven years of record lows, but in signaling the further rate hikes will likely be made slowly as the economy strengthens further and muted inflation rises.
[02:10:19.233 --> 02:10:36.036]  The Fed's move to lift the key rate by a quarter point to a range of 0.25% to 0.5% ends an extremely extraordinary seven-year period of near zero rates that began at the depths of the 2008 financial crisis.
[02:10:36.696 --> 02:10:42.538]  Consumers and businesses could now face modestly higher rates on some loans.
[02:10:42.538 --> 02:10:45.458]  So, it was supposed to break at 2.15 Eastern.
[02:10:45.458 --> 02:10:50.640]  It broke at about 2.09 Eastern.
[02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:52.860]  And so, Mr. Dent, boom, right here as it breaks.
[02:10:52.860 --> 02:10:53.780]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:10:53.780 --> 02:10:55.901]  Yeah, great to be here, finally.
[02:10:55.901 --> 02:10:58.682]  I was into politics first until the news came out.
[02:10:58.682 --> 02:11:00.122]  But, I mean, you've talked all about this.
[02:11:00.122 --> 02:11:01.402]  You predicted what they would do.
[02:11:01.402 --> 02:11:02.663]  What does this signify?
[02:11:02.663 --> 02:11:03.363]  Where is this going?
[02:11:04.332 --> 02:11:07.637]  Well, first of all, this will be the last rate hike by my forecast.
[02:11:07.637 --> 02:11:08.518]  This is too late.
[02:11:08.518 --> 02:11:11.962]  They should have done this a good bit ago, at least six months ago.
[02:11:11.962 --> 02:11:16.909]  Now they're doing it when the economy's finally weakening, only because they kind of forced to.
[02:11:16.909 --> 02:11:20.073]  It's like jobs are still good, but jobs is not the way to look at the economy.
[02:11:20.073 --> 02:11:21.716]  It's a lagging indicator.
[02:11:22.276 --> 02:11:30.005]  I look at retail sales are slowing, manufacturing slowing, all types of divergences in the stock market, which we'll talk about.
[02:11:30.005 --> 02:11:32.508]  Say we're about to go into a recession.
[02:11:32.508 --> 02:11:33.769]  Jump bond yields are going up.
[02:11:33.769 --> 02:11:37.754]  They're the first to see a recession because they're like really jittery about loan defaults.
[02:11:37.754 --> 02:11:39.436]  So I think this is too late.
[02:11:39.716 --> 02:11:46.022]  And I think by the time they would consider doing the next hike, maybe in March, April, May, they will not do it.
[02:11:46.022 --> 02:11:47.504]  I think this will be the last rate hike.
[02:11:47.504 --> 02:11:53.830]  They'll do a quarter and they'll be done for a long time, because I think the economy is going to be the worst we'll see in a long time in 2016.
[02:11:53.830 --> 02:11:56.873]  Well, we've got your charts on the computer for TV viewers, for radio listeners.
[02:11:56.873 --> 02:11:57.834]  We can talk through them.
[02:11:57.834 --> 02:11:59.396]  We're going to break in about eight, nine minutes.
[02:11:59.396 --> 02:12:03.600]  You've got the floor here to break down your analysis, where you think it's going.
[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:07.324]  The fact that your predictions have again come true pretty much.
[02:12:07.324 --> 02:12:10.347]  You said they'd admit that by the winter that things were actually slowing.
[02:12:10.347 --> 02:12:11.348]  They now admit that.
[02:12:11.348 --> 02:12:14.051]  You're saying it's probably going to get a lot worse soon.
[02:12:14.051 --> 02:12:17.075]  Walk through it for the TV viewers and radio listeners across the world.
[02:12:17.984 --> 02:12:25.009]  Well, I mean, number one, we've been saying for a long time, the everyday baby boomer peaked in spending in 2007.
[02:12:25.009 --> 02:12:28.991]  We predicted that 20 years ago, because that happens at age 46.
[02:12:28.991 --> 02:12:38.797]  Now, the affluent sector, the top 20% of consumers, they control a little over 50% of income and spending, so they're just as important.
[02:12:38.797 --> 02:12:42.520]  They don't peak until age 54, which is right now here in late 2015.
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:43.881]  So we've been saying
[02:12:44.641 --> 02:12:48.302]  There'll be a number of surprises in 2016.
[02:12:48.302 --> 02:12:54.763]  Number one, the affluent consumer will tail off, and that's going to be the final blow to consumer spending.
[02:12:54.763 --> 02:12:57.844]  And they're doing this just as the Fed is raising rates.
[02:12:57.844 --> 02:13:03.465]  Number two, Germany has the worst demographics in the world, and that's what we specialize in.
[02:13:03.465 --> 02:13:06.625]  Worse than Japan in the 90s for the next eight years.
[02:13:06.625 --> 02:13:09.706]  So Japan is going to weaken, and they're holding up Europe.
[02:13:10.046 --> 02:13:14.087]  And then finally, the great China bubble is bursting, starting with stocks.
[02:13:14.087 --> 02:13:24.509]  I'm going to show that within the next month or two, China's going to see another sharp collapse, likely in their stock market, and then their real estate's going to follow, and it's going to be game over around the world for real estate.
[02:13:24.509 --> 02:13:27.390]  So China is the biggest thing I worry about.
[02:13:27.390 --> 02:13:35.531]  I am predicting that 2016 will be the worst year for the stock market, if you look from beginning to end, of any year, including 73, 74, 2001, 2, 2008, since 1931.
[02:13:41.314 --> 02:13:45.215]  And what's scary is, have you done a chart on your general accuracy?
[02:13:45.215 --> 02:13:47.416]  I mean, I've been following you for more than a decade.
[02:13:47.416 --> 02:13:49.496]  I've gone back and looked at your stuff before that.
[02:13:49.496 --> 02:13:58.159]  You predicted almost everything that's happened, and you did it, a lot of times, against the conventional propaganda being put out from the financial sector.
[02:13:58.703 --> 02:14:00.885]  Yeah, we always... I don't try to be against the grain.
[02:14:00.885 --> 02:14:02.166]  We just have different indicators.
[02:14:02.166 --> 02:14:04.068]  We look at people and what they predictably do.
[02:14:04.068 --> 02:14:05.569]  We don't look at the government and them.
[02:14:05.569 --> 02:14:07.130]  Governments just react.
[02:14:07.130 --> 02:14:10.033]  Like now, they're reacting late to raise interest rates, you know?
[02:14:10.033 --> 02:14:13.335]  And they reacted late in 2008 to lower them.
[02:14:13.335 --> 02:14:13.996]  They react.
[02:14:13.996 --> 02:14:15.297]  They're not the future.
[02:14:15.297 --> 02:14:18.580]  People spend money predictably from cradle to grave.
[02:14:18.580 --> 02:14:22.623]  And I can tell you when people weigh the most, eat the most calories, buy cars... I'm 42!
[02:14:23.644 --> 02:14:27.425]  And I'm already thinking about saving more money, starting to cut back.
[02:14:27.425 --> 02:14:33.586]  I mean, a lot of folks do that by 45, 50, but I'm already always been a little bit more advanced than the average person just in, you know, growing up and things.
[02:14:33.586 --> 02:14:38.167]  I'm already thinking like I'm 50 and already starting to pull in my feelers.
[02:14:38.167 --> 02:14:42.628]  Yeah, and that's when people should start saving, but people do start saving in their late 40s.
[02:14:42.628 --> 02:14:44.288]  It's when their kids leave the nest.
[02:14:44.288 --> 02:14:48.229]  The kids are such an expense that most people have no room to save.
[02:14:48.229 --> 02:14:51.170]  But after the kids leave, oh, people save, and that's why
[02:14:51.650 --> 02:14:53.331]  The peak in spending comes at 46.
[02:14:53.331 --> 02:14:57.434]  It's not even the peak in income when they start saving for retirement.
[02:14:57.434 --> 02:15:04.840]  And then when they retire, not only do they not spend anymore, they spend less and less.
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:08.742]  They're not working and contributing to Social Security and Medicare and all these things.
[02:15:08.742 --> 02:15:11.825]  And we're top-heavy, but nothing compared to Japan or Germany or Italy.
[02:15:11.825 --> 02:15:13.106]  I mean, I look at their demographics.
[02:15:13.766 --> 02:15:15.026]  I mean, they're gone.
[02:15:15.026 --> 02:15:19.107]  I mean, it's... Yeah, retirement home in Hawk is what I call Japan.
[02:15:19.107 --> 02:15:24.189]  I mean, it really... And they're not doing anything to encourage higher births.
[02:15:24.189 --> 02:15:33.631]  Young people in Japan, when the crisis hit there in the early 90s, and they're still in crisis 25 years later because their demographics are so bad, and they've been doing QE all over the place.
[02:15:33.971 --> 02:15:38.094]  Young people don't even want to have sex or date or get married because they can't afford to.
[02:15:38.094 --> 02:15:39.636]  They have part-time jobs.
[02:15:39.636 --> 02:15:42.338]  They don't have any security or benefits that their parents had.
[02:15:42.338 --> 02:15:47.101]  The older people took all the benefits and left the young people with nothing.
[02:15:47.101 --> 02:15:48.262]  So, what else is coming?
[02:15:48.262 --> 02:15:49.884]  Look at that camera right there, Mr. Denton.
[02:15:49.884 --> 02:15:52.586]  I mean, tell the folks out there watching and listening, what else do you see coming?
[02:15:53.311 --> 02:15:56.715]  Well, you know, we have a chart we could throw up.
[02:15:56.715 --> 02:15:58.457]  I've been showing this now for two years.
[02:15:58.457 --> 02:16:00.799]  It's called the megaphone pattern.
[02:16:00.799 --> 02:16:05.884]  And it shows that every time we've seen a bubble, remember the bubble that peaked in early 2000 with tech stocks?
[02:16:05.884 --> 02:16:07.106]  Well, then there was a big crash.
[02:16:07.106 --> 02:16:08.007]  Yeah, we see this.
[02:16:08.007 --> 02:16:12.451]  And then we had a smaller bubble in 2007, and then it crashed.
[02:16:12.451 --> 02:16:14.654]  And now we got another great bubble.
[02:16:15.114 --> 02:16:20.158]  Each bubble has taken us to new highs, and each crash has taken us to new lows.
[02:16:20.158 --> 02:16:22.219]  Now, this is a common pattern.
[02:16:22.219 --> 02:16:24.561]  Nobody in Wall Street's paying attention to this.
[02:16:24.561 --> 02:16:26.762]  Anybody could see it, if you're not blind.
[02:16:26.762 --> 02:16:28.443]  They don't want to talk about it.
[02:16:28.443 --> 02:16:34.588]  This chart says that the next crash ought to take us to 6,000 on the Dow or lower, and probably by early 2017 or so.
[02:16:37.049 --> 02:16:41.094]  I'm seeing the signs that stocks are overvalued.
[02:16:41.094 --> 02:16:45.259]  We're seeing the signs of slowing in retail and leading indicators.
[02:16:45.259 --> 02:16:49.344]  We're seeing the sign that investors are no longer buying small cap stocks.
[02:16:49.344 --> 02:16:50.886]  They're only buying large cap stocks.
[02:16:50.886 --> 02:16:54.490]  In fact, they're only buying Google and Facebook and stocks like that.
[02:16:54.670 --> 02:17:02.116]  Well, interrupt, I'm not tooting your horn, but you said about four months ago, hey, you know, by November, by December, you're going to really know it's a serious recession.
[02:17:02.116 --> 02:17:04.018]  The bubbles are going to start imploding.
[02:17:04.018 --> 02:17:09.923]  And up until that time, the mainstream media was, everything's fine, it's getting great, everything's wonderful, they're going to raise interest rates any time.
[02:17:11.195 --> 02:17:18.304]  And now, about two months after you said that, they began to admit, okay, bad jobs numbers, bad manufacturing numbers, bad savings numbers.
[02:17:18.304 --> 02:17:21.068]  They started admitting that, okay, we're not doing too well.
[02:17:21.068 --> 02:17:22.510]  What is the real state of the economy?
[02:17:22.510 --> 02:17:26.796]  I mean, I know it's not evenly distributed around the world, but what is the state of the global economy in sectors?
[02:17:27.336 --> 02:17:30.800]  Well, again, there's certain sectors that go first and things.
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:41.212]  Again, the biggest thing I'm seeing, I look at Nordstrom and Tiffany, two of the flagship upscale retailers, their stocks are down 30 to 40 percent in the last couple of months.
[02:17:41.212 --> 02:17:46.858]  I used to go in Nordstrom's when my girls wanted shoes or something maybe once or twice a year around this time, and it was crawling with people.
[02:17:46.858 --> 02:17:47.779]  It's not half as busy.
[02:17:47.779 --> 02:17:48.440]  It's not happening now.
[02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:50.602]  Yeah, and Nordstrom had to put on sales.
[02:17:50.602 --> 02:17:58.429]  And so, what I've been looking for, again, the average person in Walmart and Target, that peaked way back in 2007.
[02:17:58.429 --> 02:18:05.716]  So what we're looking for now, I'm looking for signs that the upscale consumer is peaking, and boy, that is crystal clear.
[02:18:05.716 --> 02:18:08.358]  And when they go, there's nobody left to spend.
[02:18:08.358 --> 02:18:14.384]  And the Fed has made these upscale families, who own almost all the stocks in this country,
[02:18:14.904 --> 02:18:20.389]  Incredibly wealthy through quantitative easing that has pushed stocks into another bubble, even though the economy's not that good.
[02:18:20.389 --> 02:18:23.812]  So this is the biggest sign I'm looking for.
[02:18:23.812 --> 02:18:37.185]  But I tell you, the crash in China, and I've got a chart on that that's worth looking at, Alex, that when China crashed 42 percent just months ago, that was the same thing that happened in 1929 when that bubble burst in the United States.
[02:18:37.765 --> 02:18:55.915]  Both crashed, 42% in two and a half months, and now China is rebounding only because the Chinese government is spending hundreds of billions of dollars, this is like QE for stocks, to buy their own stock market to create a bounce, the same thing the US government did in late 29, that only lasted a few months.
[02:18:55.915 --> 02:18:57.856]  And won't that just stagnate things like Japan?
[02:18:58.519 --> 02:18:59.059]  Huh?
[02:18:59.059 --> 02:19:00.740]  Won't that just stagnate things like Japan did?
[02:19:00.740 --> 02:19:02.481]  Yeah, well China is the next Japan.
[02:19:02.481 --> 02:19:07.484]  Japan was the second great country up and coming in the late 80s before they crashed.
[02:19:07.484 --> 02:19:09.184]  China is the same thing today.
[02:19:09.184 --> 02:19:11.265]  Everybody thinks China's gonna grow at 10% forever.
[02:19:11.265 --> 02:19:11.986]  They will not.
[02:19:11.986 --> 02:19:14.127]  Shouldn't our governments do what Russia's trying to do?
[02:19:14.127 --> 02:19:15.888]  Maybe too little too late and say have kids?
[02:19:16.588 --> 02:19:17.829]  Yeah, oh absolutely.
[02:19:17.829 --> 02:19:19.251]  Everybody should be encouraging that.
[02:19:19.251 --> 02:19:21.973]  And I tell you, the biggest thing, everybody's tried everything.
[02:19:21.973 --> 02:19:26.657]  Tax credits, you know, and extended maternity leave and stuff.
[02:19:26.657 --> 02:19:28.038]  Subsidizing childcare.
[02:19:28.038 --> 02:19:30.621]  And I hate subsidies, because government's always interfering with everything.
[02:19:30.621 --> 02:19:31.542]  But you gotta make it easier.
[02:19:31.542 --> 02:19:31.622]  Yeah.
[02:19:32.082 --> 02:19:36.205]  Because women can't work and have kids unless they can get affordable child care.
[02:19:36.205 --> 02:19:38.007]  And our child care is going up.
[02:19:38.007 --> 02:19:40.149]  And it makes you believe in the future when you have kids.
[02:19:40.149 --> 02:19:41.470]  It makes you work harder.
[02:19:41.470 --> 02:19:42.671]  People are just kind of giving up.
[02:19:42.671 --> 02:19:43.791]  Going, well, it doesn't look too good.
[02:19:43.791 --> 02:19:45.072]  I'll just play video games.
[02:19:45.072 --> 02:19:49.896]  Look, a video game isn't going to make you happy at 75 years old when you're alone at Christmas, folks.
[02:19:49.896 --> 02:19:51.338]  I'm telling you, we need to survive.
[02:19:51.338 --> 02:19:53.039]  We need to thrive as a species.
[02:19:53.039 --> 02:19:54.580]  Start having some kids.
[02:19:54.580 --> 02:19:56.221]  Not importing third world populations.
[02:19:56.221 --> 02:19:57.482]  Just giving them free stuff.
[02:19:57.482 --> 02:19:57.903]  We'll be back.

[02:22:08.900 --> 02:22:12.703]  Are you willing to gamble your family's safety that it'll never happen to you?

[02:24:29.509 --> 02:24:33.130]  What was made in the USA.
[02:24:33.130 --> 02:24:36.431]  Sure sounded like a good idea.
[02:24:36.431 --> 02:24:38.591]  Until it got in the way.
[02:24:38.591 --> 02:24:38.711]  So...
[02:24:42.546 --> 02:24:44.889]  We're looking at America, its future, the world's future.
[02:24:44.889 --> 02:24:46.992]  One of the top forecasters out there, Harry Dent.

[02:24:52.139 --> 02:24:53.240]  The Demographic Cliff.
[02:24:53.240 --> 02:24:55.183]  This is a short 6-minute segment.
[02:24:55.183 --> 02:24:56.064]  18-minute segment coming up.
[02:24:56.064 --> 02:24:57.246]  He's going to be on the Nightly News tonight.
[02:24:57.526 --> 02:25:05.308]  Either I or Jakari Jackson are going to interview him for the Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock central at InfoWarsNews.com.
[02:25:05.308 --> 02:25:11.109]  We have six months free right now of the subscription service at PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWarsNews.com.
[02:25:11.109 --> 02:25:13.990]  We only do this during December and into the New Year every year.
[02:25:13.990 --> 02:25:15.290]  Normally it's five months free.
[02:25:15.290 --> 02:25:16.650]  This year I'm going crazy.
[02:25:16.650 --> 02:25:19.591]  Six months free because bandwidth costs have gone down.
[02:25:19.591 --> 02:25:24.752]  I see a day down the road where PrisonPlanet.tv is like a dollar a year.
[02:25:26.313 --> 02:25:29.815]  But right now we need to still make it where it funds the operation.
[02:25:29.815 --> 02:25:31.897]  So, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:25:31.897 --> 02:25:35.380]  20 people can use each membership, so you can get all your Christmas shopping done right now.
[02:25:35.380 --> 02:25:37.401]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:25:37.401 --> 02:25:37.882]  Harry Dent.
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:48.308]  There's so many questions I've got on the rounded top, the war talk, deflation, who do you like in the presidential race, and how do you protect yourself?
[02:25:48.308 --> 02:25:51.650]  We'll get to some of that in the next segment, but what do you want to hit first?
[02:25:51.650 --> 02:25:53.012]  More of these graphs?
[02:25:53.012 --> 02:26:02.879]  Yeah, I wanted to show one graph, the rounded top, because we're at a very critical place on the stock market, and I've been looking for a top, and I'm finally seeing the divergences.
[02:26:02.879 --> 02:26:05.782]  Large caps are doing great, as I said, and small caps are doing horrible.
[02:26:05.782 --> 02:26:07.043]  That's the classic sign
[02:26:07.723 --> 02:26:08.744]  Of a top.
[02:26:08.744 --> 02:26:20.309]  And what we've seen since May 18th, which was actually the top in the S&P 500 and Dow thus far, every time before that the market just made slight new highs and slight new highs.
[02:26:20.309 --> 02:26:23.450]  Now every time it rallies we'd see a different trend.
[02:26:23.450 --> 02:26:26.151]  It's making slightly lower highs.
[02:26:26.151 --> 02:26:28.592]  And I think that's going to happen again here.
[02:26:28.592 --> 02:26:30.913]  We're just rallying around this Fed hike.
[02:26:30.913 --> 02:26:32.434]  I think it's going to go up to about
[02:26:32.734 --> 02:26:33.114]  I think?
[02:26:51.147 --> 02:27:03.915]  In the same time frame, it's going to take about a year, year and a half from the top, but it's going to go down harder because we've extended this bubble through funny money, free money for seven years now and just stretched everything.
[02:27:03.915 --> 02:27:05.596]  Bigger bubbles, more debt.
[02:27:05.596 --> 02:27:09.038]  There's $57 trillion more debt in the world than there was in 2000.
[02:27:09.038 --> 02:27:10.399]  And there's more derivatives, right?
[02:27:10.399 --> 02:27:12.821]  More derivatives, more almost everything.
[02:27:12.821 --> 02:27:13.942]  Well, let me ask you this, because you did...
[02:27:14.895 --> 02:27:15.916]  Nail a lot of predictions.
[02:27:15.916 --> 02:27:17.216]  This one you got right.
[02:27:17.216 --> 02:27:20.078]  You said they're not going to raise rates until maybe, you know, in the winter.
[02:27:20.078 --> 02:27:21.179]  Maybe a quarter of a point.
[02:27:21.179 --> 02:27:21.959]  One and done.
[02:27:21.959 --> 02:27:27.202]  But you said, you know, within weeks or months, the crash will become evident that we're going into it.
[02:27:27.202 --> 02:27:29.263]  That's pretty much about a 98% accurate.
[02:27:29.263 --> 02:27:32.545]  I mean, they're not calling it a crash, but a lot of indicators are showing it.
[02:27:32.545 --> 02:27:36.888]  They're still trying to prop it up with the, you know, this force field of QE.
[02:27:36.888 --> 02:27:39.009]  But then how do you define a crash?
[02:27:39.009 --> 02:27:40.670]  I mean, were you dead on with that prediction?
[02:27:41.110 --> 02:27:54.359]  Well, I tell you, in that chart I showed earlier, if we do head down and break what I call like 1880 in the S&P 500, I've got reasons for that, that will lead to a crash down to 1600 or lower.
[02:27:54.359 --> 02:27:58.522]  Once you get substantially more than 20%, it says the bubble's over.
[02:27:58.522 --> 02:28:03.446]  We've seen 12% in the crash into August, and that was bigger than the October crash last year.
[02:28:03.446 --> 02:28:05.828]  So it shows the momentum's heading downward.
[02:28:05.828 --> 02:28:10.531]  But I need to see that over 20%, and then I can say this bubble is over.
[02:28:10.771 --> 02:28:17.994]  So you're saying the indicators are there, they even admit it's starting to fail, but it could go really down fast any time?
[02:28:17.994 --> 02:28:18.475]  Yes.
[02:28:18.475 --> 02:28:22.256]  Well, when this thing finally breaks, it is going to go down fast.
[02:28:22.256 --> 02:28:24.757]  And again... So it's going to be an elevator... Yes.
[02:28:24.757 --> 02:28:29.039]  That's why I tell people you're better to get out a little early than a little late in a bubble.
[02:28:29.039 --> 02:28:33.301]  Better to miss that last 5 or 10% than all of a sudden, oh, it's down 42%.
[02:28:33.301 --> 02:28:33.982]  What do I do now?
[02:28:33.982 --> 02:28:35.302]  Well, people panic.
[02:28:35.302 --> 02:28:37.303]  Are you out completely or are you... Yes.
[02:28:37.303 --> 02:28:38.284]  I'm out, definitely out.
[02:28:38.284 --> 02:28:38.864]  When did you get out?
[02:28:39.746 --> 02:28:41.974]  Um, I got out in back in April.
[02:28:43.712 --> 02:28:45.673]  Do you sometimes wish you'd eroded some more?
[02:28:45.673 --> 02:28:46.313]  No.
[02:28:46.313 --> 02:28:46.934]  No.
[02:28:46.934 --> 02:28:49.235]  Well, the market's been up very little since then.
[02:28:49.235 --> 02:28:49.615]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:28:49.615 --> 02:28:50.635]  It's been kind of flat.
[02:28:50.635 --> 02:28:53.797]  Yeah, it's been flat since November 2014.
[02:28:53.797 --> 02:29:00.020]  The market's gone nowhere, and that's the first time in this bubble... Despite mega-money printing and stock buying by governments all over the world.
[02:29:00.020 --> 02:29:00.760]  That's right.
[02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:05.683]  In other words, artificial stimulus can never work forever, because it's something for nothing.
[02:29:05.683 --> 02:29:06.623]  It's kind of like a balloon.
[02:29:06.623 --> 02:29:10.005]  Once it starts getting out of helium, it gets to that point where it just kind of lifts.
[02:29:10.005 --> 02:29:12.106]  It stops lifting, and then suddenly it starts falling.
[02:29:12.446 --> 02:29:21.312]  You can only pump- this economy has failing, slowing demographics, debt burdens, unbelievable, more than makes the 1920s look like nothing.
[02:29:21.312 --> 02:29:22.653]  Mentally ill political systems.
[02:29:22.653 --> 02:29:23.053]  Yeah.
[02:29:23.053 --> 02:29:27.656]  The economy wants to detox, deleverage, and the government won't let it.
[02:29:27.656 --> 02:29:27.976]  Okay.
[02:29:27.976 --> 02:29:29.097]  It's just gonna do it anyway.
[02:29:29.457 --> 02:29:30.978]  Harry Dent's our guest, harrydent.com.
[02:29:30.978 --> 02:29:33.481]  I want to come back and talk about wildcards.
[02:29:33.481 --> 02:29:34.662]  But are they really wildcards?
[02:29:34.662 --> 02:29:41.308]  It seems wars and all sorts of political tyranny comes historically with these downtimes.
[02:29:41.308 --> 02:29:44.631]  So how will those affect it straight ahead?
[02:29:44.631 --> 02:29:48.034]  We'll be back.
[02:29:48.034 --> 02:29:49.435]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.435 --> 02:29:51.036]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.036 --> 02:29:54.660]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.513 --> 02:30:03.737]  That's right.
[02:30:03.737 --> 02:30:05.879]  The Feds are coming to town.
[02:30:05.879 --> 02:30:09.402]  The FAA has just sent their dictate throughout the land.
[02:30:09.402 --> 02:30:15.949]  Any motorized planes heavier than a half pound, I repeat, a half pound, will have to be registered by December 21st.
[02:30:15.949 --> 02:30:21.074]  If Santa gives you one, you can't fly it outside without registering it on their list.
[02:30:21.334 --> 02:30:28.958]  Fail to do so, and the FAA will fine you $27,500 without due process, calling it a civil fine.
[02:30:28.958 --> 02:30:36.321]  If they come after you criminally, quarter of a million dollars and three years in jail for not registering your half pound and heavier plane.
[02:30:36.741 --> 02:30:42.004]  This regulation won't do anything to enforce the current prohibitions of flying close to airports.
[02:30:42.004 --> 02:30:45.606]  And they should be concerned if they can't protect airports from toy planes.
[02:30:45.606 --> 02:30:50.429]  Because that means they certainly can't protect airports from shoulder-fired missiles.
[02:30:50.429 --> 02:30:51.249]  And guess what?
[02:30:51.249 --> 02:30:54.491]  The jihadis won't be registering those with the FAA.
[02:30:54.491 --> 02:30:56.132]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:30:58.593 --> 02:31:05.496]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[02:31:05.496 --> 02:31:08.397]  We've always offered five months free.
[02:31:08.397 --> 02:31:14.279]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[02:31:14.279 --> 02:31:17.721]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[02:31:17.721 --> 02:31:20.702]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.

[02:31:58.396 --> 02:32:01.919]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:32:01.919 --> 02:32:10.165]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:10.165 --> 02:32:15.589]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:32:15.589 --> 02:32:18.111]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[02:32:29.438 --> 02:32:31.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:32:31.640 --> 02:32:36.644]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:32:36.644 --> 02:32:39.926]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:32:39.926 --> 02:32:43.409]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:32:43.409 --> 02:32:45.391]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:32:45.391 --> 02:32:47.533]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:32:47.533 --> 02:32:49.514]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[02:32:49.514 --> 02:32:55.099]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:33:15.587 --> 02:33:21.072]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:21.072 --> 02:33:25.796]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.072 --> 02:33:39.380]  Coming up in T-minus 27 minutes, David Knight, a fresh horse of a battle for liberty, takes over the InfoWars operation in the new fourth hour that so many stations are now picking up and broadcasting.
[02:33:39.380 --> 02:33:48.205]  By the way, I had stations in New York State, New Mexico, California, and Texas call me on my cell phone yesterday.
[02:33:48.205 --> 02:33:51.867]  I'm sure I know they're hitting the producers and affiliate relations up at the network in Minnesota.
[02:33:51.867 --> 02:33:55.870]  I'm down here in Austin, Texas, saying, hey, we want to carry InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:33:56.690 --> 02:34:11.685]  Debate coverage on our stations, and I never even thought it's our live coverage of special events that's so popular, and I'm targeting UHF, VHF, and cable stations, which we're starting to get some in the last month, without even really promoting it yet, that we push that next year.
[02:34:11.685 --> 02:34:13.127]  We just got up on the satellite a few months ago.
[02:34:14.687 --> 02:34:22.214]  But it's the AM and FM that actually want the nightly news, and without even promoting it, we've already got a whole bunch of stations picking that up.
[02:34:22.214 --> 02:34:24.917]  It's very exciting, folks, so praise God for that.
[02:34:24.917 --> 02:34:27.559]  I mean, seriously, the show is exploding.
[02:34:30.578 --> 02:34:35.420]  Instead of Clear Channel coming after me like they used to do, they're just telling their hosts, adopt our tactics.
[02:34:35.420 --> 02:34:38.802]  And let me tell you, that's when you know you're winning, people.
[02:34:38.802 --> 02:34:48.286]  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, and I don't want to be the big know-it-all up here with a libertarian, anti-globalist perspective, capitalist perspective.
[02:34:48.286 --> 02:34:54.769]  I want to win the culture war and have other people more eloquent, more schooled than I,
[02:34:55.629 --> 02:35:02.495]  Be influenced by my research and my guest's research and basically adopt many of our ideas because our ideas are superior.
[02:35:02.495 --> 02:35:04.897]  I mean, hands down, this is not a dumb butt show.
[02:35:04.897 --> 02:35:13.523]  This is not just milk toast one topic over and over again with mindless talking points with a bunch of liberal or conservative parrots debating it.
[02:35:13.523 --> 02:35:16.186]  This is real Americana, real renaissance.
[02:35:16.186 --> 02:35:21.230]  Speaking of real renaissance, there's ways to protect yourself in the demographic cliff that we're clearly going over.
[02:35:22.523 --> 02:35:25.986]  And Harry Dent has his book, Demographic Cliff, for free.
[02:35:25.986 --> 02:35:27.627]  It's $4.95 for the shipping.
[02:35:27.627 --> 02:35:32.611]  I happen to know, with shipping and handling, with media mail, that's what it costs.
[02:35:32.611 --> 02:35:33.752]  So this is at cost.
[02:35:33.752 --> 02:35:35.894]  You add in other issues.
[02:35:35.894 --> 02:35:39.777]  I bet you're, I know you're losing money because to print one of these books will probably cost three, four bucks.
[02:35:39.777 --> 02:35:41.058]  So he's losing money doing it.
[02:35:41.058 --> 02:35:45.321]  He knows the best-selling author to get it to you, to obviously get a relationship with you with his newsletter.
[02:35:45.321 --> 02:35:46.922]  A lot of great info there.
[02:35:46.922 --> 02:35:47.963]  HarryDent.com.
[02:35:47.963 --> 02:35:48.704]  It's a loss leader.
[02:35:49.244 --> 02:35:52.325]  If you don't get the book for $4.95, at least give it to friends and family.
[02:35:52.325 --> 02:35:53.646]  You may know all about this.
[02:35:53.646 --> 02:35:54.626]  Give it to somebody.
[02:35:54.626 --> 02:35:57.848]  If you don't get a book at that cost, I mean, it's really a stupid move.
[02:35:57.848 --> 02:35:59.528]  Donate to the library, whatever.
[02:35:59.528 --> 02:36:01.029]  Our biggest problem is our audience is already so informed.
[02:36:01.029 --> 02:36:02.189]  They're like, why get a book?
[02:36:02.189 --> 02:36:07.512]  To get the craft, to have the info, to really immerse yourself in it, and see if you can learn something from it.
[02:36:07.512 --> 02:36:08.652]  I know I certainly did.
[02:36:08.652 --> 02:36:12.954]  So that's harrydent.com to find that deal.
[02:36:12.954 --> 02:36:14.975]  Now before we go any further, you've got until.
[02:36:16.104 --> 02:36:27.932]  You've got until Friday at noon to assure in the lower 48 that you get your shipments of Nutraceuticals, Hillary for Prison shirts, high-quality water filters, non-GMO heirloom seeds, lowest prices.
[02:36:27.932 --> 02:36:37.738]  We have over 600 products now at InfoWarsTore.com, and it's all stuff I use, all stuff I love, all things that I know you like, and we study what's popular as well.
[02:36:37.738 --> 02:36:39.780]  And lo and behold, my audience likes the same stuff I do.
[02:36:40.723 --> 02:36:41.184]  We are.
[02:36:41.184 --> 02:36:45.928]  The store is doing very well and helping fund the operation because it's so competitive.
[02:36:45.928 --> 02:36:59.382]  It's such quality, whether it's solar-powered systems, whether it's high-quality, storable foods, whether it's come and take it, Molang Labe, Patriot apparel for men and women, so we can aggressively get out there and meet like-minded people.
[02:37:00.003 --> 02:37:02.405]  You know, just wear our colors openly.
[02:37:02.405 --> 02:37:08.649]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com, and a bunch of specials.
[02:37:08.649 --> 02:37:14.273]  As much as 33% off the nutraceuticals and different package deals ends this Friday.
[02:37:14.273 --> 02:37:17.796]  So, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:37:17.796 --> 02:37:19.217]  And you can also get six months free.
[02:37:19.217 --> 02:37:25.782]  We've never offered six months for InfoWars Nightly News at PrisonPlanet.tv, all my films, so much more.
[02:37:25.782 --> 02:37:27.103]  Twenty people can use it.
[02:37:27.103 --> 02:37:28.584]  I'm now ranting about that subject.
[02:37:29.662 --> 02:37:34.047]  I do want to open the phones up for quick questions for Mr. Dent while we've got him.
[02:37:34.047 --> 02:37:35.448]  Your economic questions at 800-259-9231.
[02:37:35.448 --> 02:37:35.728]  800-259-9231.
[02:37:35.728 --> 02:37:38.151]  And we will take your phone calls as well.
[02:37:38.151 --> 02:37:40.493]  Just opened those phones up about two minutes ago.
[02:37:48.101 --> 02:37:51.103]  Okay, you heard my question before the break, Mr. Dent.
[02:37:51.103 --> 02:37:59.748]  What about wild cards of war that tend to, in my graphs looking at history, tend to pop up almost always around big economic downturns, and we see the evidence of it happening again.
[02:37:59.748 --> 02:38:02.210]  What about social unrest?
[02:38:02.210 --> 02:38:03.691]  How do those exacerbate
[02:38:04.565 --> 02:38:05.066]  I don't think so.
[02:38:19.554 --> 02:38:24.757]  Well, you know, first of all, you look at the Great Depression led to World War II.
[02:38:24.757 --> 02:38:37.705]  You know, Hitler was rising, and when you have a fixed pie or a shrinking pie, it makes sense for governments to expand at others' expense, for Germany to roll into Poland and France and the rest of Europe, and the same thing for Japan.
[02:38:37.705 --> 02:38:42.208]  So there is a reason when economies get weak, there is a big motive for war.
[02:38:42.208 --> 02:38:43.149]  Now, you look at Russia.
[02:38:43.849 --> 02:38:48.813]  Russia is one of the worst demographic countries ahead, already is.
[02:38:48.813 --> 02:38:53.817]  And Russia has falling oil and commodity prices, which is their bread and butter.
[02:38:53.817 --> 02:38:54.998]  So they're in real trouble.
[02:38:54.998 --> 02:39:00.963]  There's every incentive for Putin to try to expand into Ukraine and Georgia and any place he can.
[02:39:00.963 --> 02:39:02.565]  So that's going to continue to happen.
[02:39:02.565 --> 02:39:08.910]  But more importantly, Alex, I have a geopolitical indicator that is just incredible.
[02:39:09.887 --> 02:39:17.469]  Every 35 years for about 17-18 years everything's hunky-dory and then for 17-18 years everything's terrible.
[02:39:17.469 --> 02:39:21.691]  And basically we had great geopolitical trends from 83 to 2000.
[02:39:21.691 --> 02:39:23.271]  Think of what went wrong in the world back then.
[02:39:23.271 --> 02:39:29.493]  The worst thing that happened we had a hundred hour war with Saddam Hussein and kicked him out and didn't try to take over the country and it was all over.
[02:39:30.827 --> 02:39:38.069]  From 9-11 to now and into late 2019 at a minimum, this geopolitical cycle keeps getting worse.
[02:39:38.069 --> 02:39:44.191]  I'm not surprised to see the metro jet go down from Russia and the terrorist attacks in Paris.
[02:39:44.191 --> 02:39:47.092]  ISIS rose out of our failure in Iraq.
[02:39:47.092 --> 02:39:56.295]  We left there after not winning a war and they basically took all the disaffected Sunni soldiers and generals and turned them into ISIS.
[02:39:56.295 --> 02:39:57.615]  Now we got a huge problem.
[02:39:58.075 --> 02:40:06.518]  So this is going to continue, and this is another reason the stock market's not just going to be able to keep going up, living on stimulus and QE.
[02:40:06.518 --> 02:40:09.780]  Bad geopolitical trends make the stock market worse.
[02:40:09.780 --> 02:40:12.080]  And food's running out all over the world.
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:13.861]  Populations are ballooning.
[02:40:13.861 --> 02:40:18.343]  The bizarre left then wants to import these motley crews and use them as political weapons.
[02:40:19.023 --> 02:40:21.546]  I mean, I agree, the trends, the history, it's all there.
[02:40:21.546 --> 02:40:26.891]  You add, though, all these other things that we didn't have previously, this looks downright explosive.
[02:40:26.891 --> 02:40:33.497]  And we have Ministry of Defense reports from 2007 and Pentagon reports predicting all this starting 2016 and beyond.
[02:40:33.497 --> 02:40:34.959]  It basically meshes with your graphs.
[02:40:35.259 --> 02:40:35.780]  Yeah, it does.
[02:40:35.780 --> 02:40:38.403]  And I tell you, Europe has got the worst of it here.
[02:40:38.403 --> 02:40:43.389]  They already haven't seen the Euro disintegrate because of the rich countries versus the poor countries.
[02:40:43.389 --> 02:40:45.352]  That disparity is causing imbalances.
[02:40:45.352 --> 02:40:48.676]  Now, this Paris attack, they have open borders.
[02:40:48.676 --> 02:40:51.880]  You know, they have open migration and open trade of goods.
[02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:52.641]  This is ending.
[02:40:53.101 --> 02:40:58.006]  Every country's gonna say, we gotta protect our borders now, and that's the last blow to the Euro.
[02:40:58.006 --> 02:41:00.989]  And Europe is right there next to Russia.
[02:41:00.989 --> 02:41:08.256]  Russia's gonna bear the brunt, I mean, Europe's gonna bear the brunt of this Russian aggression, and the brunt of the Middle East terrorist attacks.
[02:41:08.256 --> 02:41:09.097]  It's gonna rise.
[02:41:09.097 --> 02:41:10.599]  It's harder for them to attack here.
[02:41:10.599 --> 02:41:12.220]  Our Muslims are more integrated.
[02:41:12.220 --> 02:41:13.121]  Europe's are not.
[02:41:13.121 --> 02:41:16.464]  So, Europe is really gonna get hit hard in the next several years.
[02:41:17.305 --> 02:41:20.126]  This, we're seeing a peak, not for the U.S.
[02:41:20.126 --> 02:41:22.808]  as much, more like a plateau, a peak for Europe.
[02:41:22.808 --> 02:41:24.028]  Europe's never going to be the same.
[02:41:24.028 --> 02:41:33.553]  What about bizarre cultural suicide, leftist behavior, peaking with them saying, ban brown paper bags, and Darth Vader's racist, ban him.
[02:41:33.553 --> 02:41:35.334]  I mean, the so-called left...
[02:41:36.072 --> 02:41:37.113]  And I'm not a left or right guy.
[02:41:37.113 --> 02:41:38.214]  I mean, I'm just a libertarian.
[02:41:38.214 --> 02:41:41.056]  I used to be, you know, against Bush, but I wasn't for the Democrats.
[02:41:41.056 --> 02:41:57.150]  They really do act like crazy people with the stuff on CNN, the stuff on MSNBC, the bizarreness at the colleges, you know, saying change the name of a building from Lynch Hall because Lynch reminds them of lynching, but don't change the Attorney General's name.
[02:41:57.150 --> 02:42:00.353]  I mean, it really has reached a mental illness level.
[02:42:00.353 --> 02:42:01.574]  How do you see that affecting things?
[02:42:01.894 --> 02:42:07.798]  Well, you know, this is what I'd call a bipolar political situation.
[02:42:07.798 --> 02:42:13.383]  I see extreme problems on the extreme right and the extreme left, and things are moving in both directions.
[02:42:13.383 --> 02:42:23.670]  And this happens when you have times of income inequality, like the Roaring Twenties, and now, where the top 1% control 50% of the wealth and things like that.
[02:42:23.670 --> 02:42:27.974]  You get this bipolar thing, and neither side can agree with each other.
[02:42:27.974 --> 02:42:29.795]  That's why you can't pass any effective
[02:42:29.855 --> 02:42:34.497]  But a lot of the ultra-rich are the ones financing the left and this class envy.
[02:42:34.497 --> 02:42:36.378]  They're misdirected at the middle class.
[02:42:36.378 --> 02:42:37.859]  And they're financing the right.
[02:42:37.859 --> 02:42:41.321]  The Koch brothers pretty much vetoed Mitt Romney.
[02:42:41.321 --> 02:42:44.603]  They want somebody farther right.
[02:42:44.603 --> 02:42:46.443]  This is not a healthy sign.
[02:42:46.443 --> 02:42:51.386]  This is where we were in the late 20s, early 30s, and we had to have the system break down.
[02:42:51.386 --> 02:42:53.067]  Where would we be if Mitt Romney was in?
[02:42:54.710 --> 02:42:57.754]  Frankly, I don't think politicians make that big a difference.
[02:42:57.754 --> 02:43:00.438]  Only in a crisis do they.
[02:43:00.438 --> 02:43:05.345]  I don't think we'd be that much different, but I think we might be better off on foreign policy.
[02:43:10.833 --> 02:43:14.999]  But before we do that, I need to see the call screen up there, guys, so I can tell you who the callers are.
[02:43:14.999 --> 02:43:15.840]  Let me ask you this.
[02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:24.653]  Who do you like, though, just as a personal guy, you know, as a father, of the candidates, Hillary, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz?
[02:43:24.653 --> 02:43:25.935]  I mean, who do you overall...
[02:43:26.836 --> 02:43:29.339]  In general, think, you know, might make a better president.
[02:43:29.339 --> 02:43:40.712]  I understand they probably can't change that much overall, but at least a Rand Paul wouldn't come after our guns, at least a Ted Cruz or a Donald Trump wouldn't come after our guns and doesn't have some suicide wish for the country in my view.
[02:43:41.445 --> 02:43:44.047]  Well, you know, I don't really like any of them.
[02:43:44.047 --> 02:43:46.308]  I don't think we have a good choice of candidates.
[02:43:46.308 --> 02:43:48.809]  Trump is at least saying some things that need to be said.
[02:43:48.809 --> 02:43:49.490]  Yeah, I like Trump.
[02:43:49.490 --> 02:43:55.193]  But, you know, then he turns around and says something totally crazy like we're going to- Cut off the internet.
[02:43:55.193 --> 02:43:56.634]  11 million immigrants back.
[02:43:56.634 --> 02:43:58.175]  That would cost a fortune.
[02:43:58.175 --> 02:43:59.636]  It would be impossible to do.
[02:44:00.516 --> 02:44:06.398]  And it would cause an instant recession from the loss of jobs and income and spending, even if it were temporary.
[02:44:06.398 --> 02:44:13.000]  So, you know, if I had to pick one, I would agree more with Rand Paul, because I'm more of a libertarian in that regard.
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:14.620]  Yeah, he is the best overall.
[02:44:14.620 --> 02:44:19.782]  But for me, the guy I would like to see is somebody like Michael Bloomberg.
[02:44:19.782 --> 02:44:20.702]  Run a big city.
[02:44:20.702 --> 02:44:22.223]  He's a billionaire.
[02:44:22.223 --> 02:44:23.023]  I've been in Bloomberg.
[02:44:23.023 --> 02:44:26.044]  No, I know, but he's good on a lot of business stuff, but he's anti-gun.
[02:44:26.724 --> 02:44:27.424]  Yeah.
[02:44:27.424 --> 02:44:28.845]  Well, I can live with that.
[02:44:28.845 --> 02:44:33.088]  I mean, we already have 300-some million guns, so, you know... You don't think you'd be able to get them?
[02:44:33.088 --> 02:44:35.529]  Well, first of all, you can't do much about it at this point.
[02:44:36.352 --> 02:44:40.715]  But I don't see, I don't think gun owners, I think there are some extremes in gun ownership.
[02:44:40.715 --> 02:44:42.516]  People shouldn't have AK-47s.
[02:44:42.516 --> 02:44:43.757]  Come on, you don't hunt with that.
[02:44:43.757 --> 02:44:48.000]  No, no, but I mean, I understand your view on that, but the AK-47s aren't committing the crimes most of the time.
[02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.001]  I mean, it's people doing it, but those aren't even guns.
[02:44:50.001 --> 02:44:52.143]  They want to... Well, the terrorists use them.
[02:44:52.143 --> 02:44:56.846]  Yeah, they want to demonize a certain type of gun, and then once they've sent the President to ban that, they can ban everything.
[02:44:56.846 --> 02:44:56.986]  Yeah.
[02:44:58.647 --> 02:45:01.850]  But again, I want somebody that can have respect overseas.
[02:45:01.850 --> 02:45:07.735]  I don't see any of the candidates that overseas diplomats and prime ministers around the world would respect.
[02:45:07.735 --> 02:45:08.775]  Who's the best you think though?
[02:45:08.775 --> 02:45:10.277]  I mean on that front, maybe Rand Paul?
[02:45:11.403 --> 02:45:18.988]  No, I don't think Cruz, I don't think Trump, Bernie Sanders, no way.
[02:45:18.988 --> 02:45:20.789]  Hillary would get the most respect.
[02:45:20.789 --> 02:45:25.052]  What do you think about Kasich saying punch the Russians in the nose?
[02:45:25.052 --> 02:45:29.455]  What do you make with Christie saying let's shoot down Russian jets?
[02:45:29.455 --> 02:45:31.817]  I mean it sounded like frothing mad dogs.
[02:45:31.977 --> 02:45:32.538]  Yeah, no, no.
[02:45:32.538 --> 02:45:35.701]  I mean, we have been too aggressive.
[02:45:35.701 --> 02:45:37.903]  We can no longer police the world.
[02:45:37.903 --> 02:45:39.064]  We don't have the capacity.
[02:45:39.064 --> 02:45:43.048]  We failed in Vietnam, then we failed in Iraq, failed in Afghanistan.
[02:45:43.048 --> 02:45:47.873]  We can fight an on-and-on war against somebody like Russia, like if they invade Ukraine.
[02:45:47.873 --> 02:45:48.573]  That we can do.
[02:45:48.573 --> 02:45:50.075]  But fighting these guerrilla wars
[02:45:50.775 --> 02:45:52.737]  And I would not provoke Russia.
[02:45:52.737 --> 02:45:53.978]  Why would you provoke Russia?
[02:45:53.978 --> 02:45:55.739]  If they do attack, we support our allies.
[02:45:55.739 --> 02:46:03.125]  But we have to get people to defend themselves in their own territories and support them rather than us being the ones come in and do it for them.
[02:46:03.125 --> 02:46:04.986]  We can't afford that.
[02:46:04.986 --> 02:46:06.888]  And especially in the Middle East.
[02:46:06.888 --> 02:46:13.173]  You go in the Middle East, even if you win, even if you help people, they still hate you because you're considered infidels.
[02:46:13.173 --> 02:46:14.274]  They don't want us.
[02:46:14.674 --> 02:46:25.124]  And ISIS is trying to tempt us every way they can to come into the Middle East, boots on the ground, so they can defeat us once and for all.
[02:46:25.124 --> 02:46:26.986]  They should not do that at any cost.
[02:46:26.986 --> 02:46:27.547]  Absolutely.
[02:46:27.547 --> 02:46:28.588]  And it comes down to this.
[02:46:28.588 --> 02:46:30.630]  I love everybody.
[02:46:30.630 --> 02:46:32.532]  I am a true classical liberal at the end of the day.
[02:46:33.092 --> 02:46:33.172]  Yes.
[02:46:50.976 --> 02:46:52.037]  I'm not the one doing this.
[02:46:52.037 --> 02:46:55.199]  It'd be like if I was Jewish and I said Hitler's coming after me.
[02:46:55.199 --> 02:46:59.563]  I mean, I'm not supposed to say I like Hitler because I'm, you know, anti-German if I don't like Hitler.
[02:46:59.563 --> 02:47:02.965]  Or I'm anti-Soviet because I'm a capitalist and they want to arrest me.
[02:47:02.965 --> 02:47:05.667]  I mean, radical Islam is taking over Islam.
[02:47:05.667 --> 02:47:07.549]  It wants to conquer me and my family.
[02:47:07.549 --> 02:47:08.709]  It's super oppressive.
[02:47:08.709 --> 02:47:09.890]  It's Stone Age.
[02:47:09.890 --> 02:47:11.131]  It's Dark Age.
[02:47:11.131 --> 02:47:12.993]  I don't like it and I'm going to say the truth about it.
[02:47:13.635 --> 02:47:16.597]  Well, you know, Bill Maher is one of the most liberal people out there.
[02:47:16.597 --> 02:47:20.159]  He's a comedian, but he's a real political commentator, and he says the same thing.
[02:47:20.159 --> 02:47:26.882]  He said there is something fundamentally wrong with their approach and their beliefs, and it is difficult.
[02:47:26.882 --> 02:47:34.046]  And, you know, somebody should start saying, look, if they don't reform their religion, they're going to provoke a lot of backlash.
[02:47:34.046 --> 02:47:35.027]  There's no question about it.
[02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:39.064]  Yeah, I mean, come on.
[02:47:39.064 --> 02:47:42.787]  The Middle East is not going to win a war with Europe.
[02:47:42.787 --> 02:47:46.892]  And the thing is, the socialists want to make a deal with them to come in and checkmate and take over.
[02:47:46.892 --> 02:47:48.653]  They're going to stab them in the back, too.
[02:47:48.653 --> 02:47:54.559]  I mean, we've got to reform Islam or there's going to be this clash of civilizations, and I'm telling you, the Muslims are going to lose.
[02:47:55.296 --> 02:47:55.696]  Yes.
[02:47:55.696 --> 02:48:02.682]  I mean, the only thing they have in their favor is conviction and demographics, because they breed more than we do.
[02:48:02.682 --> 02:48:04.203]  And they know that.
[02:48:04.203 --> 02:48:11.409]  And why wouldn't Europe want to repopulate with, say, people from Chile or something who are Christian, have some free market ideas?
[02:48:11.409 --> 02:48:16.313]  I'm nothing against the folks in the Middle East and stuff, but I mean, this just doesn't come, it doesn't go together.
[02:48:16.313 --> 02:48:19.355]  There's been major wars for 1,400 years.
[02:48:19.355 --> 02:48:22.518]  Parts of Europe got, Poland and Spain got taken over.
[02:48:23.098 --> 02:48:28.159]  I mean, I don't understand this idea that bring in these people who say they're going to conquer us.
[02:48:28.891 --> 02:48:30.472]  Yeah, and that's why we're fortunate.
[02:48:30.472 --> 02:48:36.614]  We attract people, especially from Asia, but especially Mexico and Latin America, and they are more like us.
[02:48:36.614 --> 02:48:38.375]  They tend to be Christians.
[02:48:38.375 --> 02:48:44.297]  It's easier to assimilate people that have at least a similar... Yeah, so why is it Europe's trying to get Latin Americans to come?
[02:48:44.297 --> 02:48:45.037]  Well, because it's hard.
[02:48:45.037 --> 02:48:45.758]  They're far away.
[02:48:45.758 --> 02:48:50.840]  I mean, where they are, if you look south of Europe, what you have is North America.
[02:48:50.840 --> 02:48:52.000]  It's like, oh, here's the Muslim countries.
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:53.901]  They've invaded us about a hundred times.
[02:48:53.901 --> 02:48:56.142]  Let's just give part of Serbia to Albania.
[02:48:57.942 --> 02:48:59.203]  I mean, I just can't handle it.
[02:48:59.203 --> 02:49:01.625]  I mean, our elites are really out of control.
[02:49:01.625 --> 02:49:03.066]  Who's up first here?
[02:49:03.066 --> 02:49:04.828]  Eric in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[02:49:04.828 --> 02:49:08.071]  You got a question for Harry Dent.
[02:49:08.071 --> 02:49:09.552]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[02:49:09.552 --> 02:49:12.715]  I just love listening to your show, buying all your products.
[02:49:12.715 --> 02:49:13.055]  Thank you.
[02:49:13.055 --> 02:49:19.100]  I really want to show off the liberals up there in Minnesota that there's a lot of free thinkers.
[02:49:19.100 --> 02:49:19.781]  I understand, brother.
[02:49:19.781 --> 02:49:21.722]  What's your question?
[02:49:21.722 --> 02:49:24.945]  Okay, my question is, our family, we're looking to sell our house.
[02:49:25.572 --> 02:49:37.797]  And my question for Harry is, would you recommend us selling the house right now and then maybe renting for a year or two and then finding a good price after this recession or this downturn hits?
[02:49:37.797 --> 02:49:39.017]  Excellent question, Eric.
[02:49:39.017 --> 02:49:39.977]  God bless you.
[02:49:39.977 --> 02:49:40.778]  Merry Christmas.
[02:49:40.778 --> 02:49:41.898]  Go ahead.
[02:49:41.898 --> 02:49:42.358]  Yes, Eric.
[02:49:42.358 --> 02:49:42.858]  100%.
[02:49:42.858 --> 02:49:48.781]  Real estate even more than stocks, because even if I'm a little late selling stocks, I can still sell them any minute of the day.
[02:49:48.781 --> 02:49:54.283]  Real estate freezes up, gets very illiquid fast when we see a crash like we saw in 2008.
[02:49:55.283 --> 02:49:59.946]  I've been telling people, sell real estate by early 2016, the latest.
[02:49:59.946 --> 02:50:03.628]  And if you get a, don't be too picky, if you get a reasonable offer, take it.
[02:50:03.628 --> 02:50:10.672]  And I think it's going to be a number of years before we get a buy opportunity, maybe at least 2020, possibly earlier.
[02:50:10.672 --> 02:50:21.219]  Of course, there's always great deals in a crash, but I've been renting since late 2005 when I predicted the real estate would crash last time around, and it did.
[02:50:21.219 --> 02:50:22.680]  And you predicted when it would crash?
[02:50:23.140 --> 02:50:32.169]  Well, I said in late 2005, this bubble's getting ready to burst, and then a few months later, housing prices peaked in early 2016.
[02:50:32.169 --> 02:50:33.870]  You called it really close, though, in 2008.
[02:50:33.870 --> 02:50:35.972]  I mean, 2007-8.
[02:50:35.972 --> 02:50:38.135]  We called that 20 years in advance.
[02:50:38.135 --> 02:50:41.998]  But you even called, I haven't read the articles in a while, but didn't you call it right in the exact sector?
[02:50:43.160 --> 02:50:44.561]  Well, we warned it was coming.
[02:50:44.561 --> 02:50:46.503]  You know, that market kind of sneaked in.
[02:50:46.503 --> 02:50:48.404]  We called that one a little bit after.
[02:50:48.404 --> 02:50:50.046]  We said, OK, now the stock market.
[02:50:50.046 --> 02:50:51.467]  But at first, it didn't look like a peak.
[02:50:51.467 --> 02:50:56.451]  We're going to come back and talk to George, Steve, and others straight ahead.
[02:50:56.451 --> 02:50:57.192]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:50:59.062 --> 02:51:02.603]  We've had an amazing year here at Supernatural Silver.
[02:51:02.603 --> 02:51:12.345]  We've truly enjoyed the fantastic response from thousands of people as they've tried our extraordinary product, and we're thrilled at the life-changing results people have.

[02:51:29.735 --> 02:51:33.579]  A gift that can change lives and make a real difference.
[02:51:33.579 --> 02:51:40.488]  In a world where we are constantly exposed to dangerous health threats, give yourself and your loved ones a fighting chance.

[02:51:58.871 --> 02:52:08.318]  We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day, but growing scientific evidence has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.

[02:52:28.453 --> 02:52:32.714]  With a new year coming, it's time for a new way to look at weapon storage.
[02:52:32.714 --> 02:52:35.954]  Safes can't be accessed quickly and racks are unsafe for children.
[02:52:35.954 --> 02:52:38.535]  Covert Cabinets are the next level in home defense.
[02:52:38.535 --> 02:52:43.976]  They fit seamlessly into any home's decor and they provide quick access to firearms while keeping them uniquely hidden.
[02:52:43.976 --> 02:52:46.596]  Covert Cabinets, the ideal hidden storage solution.
[02:52:46.596 --> 02:52:48.056]  Custom made in the USA.
[02:52:48.056 --> 02:52:53.597]  Covert Cabinets are an elegant and practical alternative to the bulky and obvious storage systems of the past.
[02:52:53.597 --> 02:52:55.778]  Find out more at CovertCabinets.com.
[02:52:55.778 --> 02:52:57.038]  That's CovertCabinets.com.
[02:52:58.277 --> 02:53:01.598]  My name is Bill Bonner and I have an important message.
[02:53:01.598 --> 02:53:07.080]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[02:53:07.080 --> 02:53:09.360]  But they're about to lose control.
[02:53:09.360 --> 02:53:14.302]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[02:53:14.682 --> 02:53:19.265]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[02:53:19.265 --> 02:53:21.667]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[02:53:21.667 --> 02:53:25.510]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[02:53:25.510 --> 02:53:30.033]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[02:53:30.033 --> 02:53:33.155]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[02:53:33.155 --> 02:53:35.737]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[02:53:35.737 --> 02:53:37.098]  This will affect us all.
[02:53:37.578 --> 02:53:42.321]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[02:53:42.321 --> 02:53:48.706]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.
[02:53:48.706 --> 02:53:54.830]  You can watch the video for free right now by going to DollarDanger.com.
[02:53:54.830 --> 02:53:56.811]  Again, that's DollarDanger.com.
[02:54:08.433 --> 02:54:09.974]  I got it!
[02:54:09.974 --> 02:54:11.054]  Watch me!
[02:54:11.054 --> 02:54:13.595]  I got something and it's super bad!
[02:54:13.595 --> 02:54:15.056]  Hey!
[02:54:15.056 --> 02:54:17.276]  I got something that makes me want to shout!
[02:54:17.276 --> 02:54:18.437]  It's all being free, folks.
[02:54:18.437 --> 02:54:24.279]  We're going to do five more minutes of The Next Hour with Mr. Dent, and we're going to interview him, Jakari Jackson, for the Nightly News tonight.
[02:54:24.279 --> 02:54:26.140]  David Knight's going to be taking over.
[02:54:26.140 --> 02:54:34.443]  He's going to be talking about the no-fly zones, the calls for war, the GOP debates, the FAA coming to town.
[02:54:34.443 --> 02:54:37.164]  This is so big, Shane, even a half-pound toy plane.
[02:54:38.069 --> 02:54:38.729]  I mean, stuff that costs $20.
[02:54:38.729 --> 02:54:46.033]  These little bitty drones, they'll give you huge fines and prison time if you don't register with the FAA.
[02:54:46.033 --> 02:54:47.854]  And the power to tax is the power to destroy.
[02:54:47.854 --> 02:54:48.674]  $27,000 fines, $250,000 fines, three years in prison.
[02:54:53.929 --> 02:54:55.731]  This is just unbelievable.
[02:54:55.731 --> 02:54:59.576]  And they can already geolocate with the drones where they can't fly in restricted areas.
[02:54:59.576 --> 02:55:01.598]  This is so incredible.
[02:55:01.598 --> 02:55:03.821]  And I predict this is going to be ignored massively.
[02:55:03.821 --> 02:55:07.345]  Like the $15,000 fines that Obama put in for garage sales.
[02:55:07.345 --> 02:55:08.927]  No one follows that.
[02:55:08.927 --> 02:55:09.668]  But it just shows.
[02:55:09.668 --> 02:55:10.409]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[02:55:10.409 --> 02:55:11.270]  Type that in.
[02:55:11.270 --> 02:55:12.631]  $15 million fines for garage sales.
[02:55:12.631 --> 02:55:13.553]  The feds say they're illegal.
[02:55:14.773 --> 02:55:18.701]  I want to take some more phone calls here with Mr. Dent.
[02:55:18.701 --> 02:55:19.903]  Who's up next here?
[02:55:19.903 --> 02:55:23.431]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Connecticut.
[02:55:23.431 --> 02:55:24.072]  You're on the air.
[02:55:24.072 --> 02:55:24.332]  Go ahead.
[02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:34.964]  Mr. Dent, I'm presently, most of my investments are in IRA and I basically dissolved almost everything except GLD, a small portion.
[02:55:34.964 --> 02:55:45.889]  I'm trying to think about maybe putting it into real estate or into real gold, you know, solid gold under my name, but do you have to take delivery type of thing to be sure?
[02:55:45.889 --> 02:55:47.510]  Because my greatest concern is
[02:55:48.070 --> 02:55:54.214]  They're going to be doing bail-ins, the government saying, oh, the IRA, well, let's take 50% of your IRA.
[02:55:54.214 --> 02:55:58.437]  They're already talking about that, and they've done it in Europe, but then, I mean, so there's a lot of questions there.
[02:55:58.437 --> 02:56:00.758]  What about them going after cash, bail-ins?
[02:56:00.758 --> 02:56:01.459]  What do you protect?
[02:56:01.459 --> 02:56:02.820]  How do you protect yourself from that?
[02:56:02.820 --> 02:56:03.580]  Thank you, George.
[02:56:03.580 --> 02:56:04.721]  Here's the important thing.
[02:56:04.721 --> 02:56:08.183]  This downturn will be unlike any downturn in your lifetime.
[02:56:08.183 --> 02:56:09.664]  It will be like the 30s.
[02:56:09.664 --> 02:56:12.366]  When you get bubbles in everything, everything's bubbled up.
[02:56:12.366 --> 02:56:16.489]  Real estate, commodities, gold was a bubble and is bursting.
[02:56:16.929 --> 02:56:21.411]  Stocks all around the world, everything crashes just like in 2008.
[02:56:21.411 --> 02:56:27.594]  Look at late 2008 when the meltdown actually happened and Lehman Brothers was melting down.
[02:56:27.594 --> 02:56:29.635]  Stocks, commodities, gold went down.
[02:56:29.635 --> 02:56:33.256]  And you've been predicting the deflation and you've been proven right.
[02:56:33.256 --> 02:56:37.358]  Now isn't it true though, 10, 15, 20 years down the road, gold's going to go stratospheric.
[02:56:37.658 --> 02:56:38.478]  Absolutely.
[02:56:38.478 --> 02:56:42.340]  The emerging world is going to drive the next boom from early 2020s forward.
[02:56:42.340 --> 02:56:46.402]  They are heavy commodity buyers and heavy gold buyers.
[02:56:46.402 --> 02:56:58.987]  For me, gold is an emergency thing that you literally bury, and then in an emergency you can at least get something for it, but down the road, I mean, it's just going to be absolutely valuable with all this inflation that will come after the deflation.
[02:56:59.147 --> 02:57:02.370]  Yeah, I don't like gold and real estate is going to deflate more than anything.
[02:57:02.370 --> 02:57:08.937]  So it's better to keep your money in safe, you know, low yield, safe bonds, cash, things like that.
[02:57:08.937 --> 02:57:10.619]  But he's saying what about bail-ins and looting?
[02:57:10.619 --> 02:57:11.540]  What about government looting?
[02:57:12.239 --> 02:57:18.121]  Well, to me, the best thing to do is have your money in a brokerage account under your name, not in a bank account, things like that.
[02:57:18.121 --> 02:57:23.243]  What about getting a small farm and working with folks that know how to do it and trying to produce organic food?
[02:57:23.243 --> 02:57:28.705]  If you can produce something affordable and be more self-sufficient, that's a good thing.
[02:57:28.705 --> 02:57:31.046]  But farmland is also in a bubble.
[02:57:31.046 --> 02:57:33.666]  Believe me, it's gone up seven to ten times in the last hundred years.
[02:57:33.666 --> 02:57:36.547]  So wait until that busts and then go into it if you know what you're doing.
[02:57:36.547 --> 02:57:38.028]  I totally agree with that.
[02:57:38.028 --> 02:57:40.489]  Let's go ahead and talk to, who's been holding the longest here?
[02:57:41.428 --> 02:57:46.789]  Let's talk to Greg in Michigan on a quick question for Mr. Denton.
[02:57:46.789 --> 02:57:48.990]  Gentlemen, Merry Christmas to you all.
[02:57:48.990 --> 02:57:49.290]  Thank you.
[02:57:49.290 --> 02:57:50.870]  Terry, I'm a big fan.
[02:57:50.870 --> 02:57:52.171]  I read your first book in 1989.
[02:57:52.171 --> 02:57:54.651]  I think it was called The Power Tripper Dick.
[02:57:54.651 --> 02:57:54.931]  Yeah.
[02:57:54.931 --> 02:57:58.672]  I think I read The Great Boom Ahead in 2006.
[02:57:58.672 --> 02:58:08.195]  But I'm still struggling with the idea that gold is a commodity when central banks are buying it hand over fist.
[02:58:09.059 --> 02:58:11.480]  It's being manipulated on the Comex.
[02:58:11.480 --> 02:58:14.501]  It's really a currency, by the way people are treating it.
[02:58:14.501 --> 02:58:14.921]  Well, I agree.
[02:58:14.921 --> 02:58:16.061]  It has a dual-ish.
[02:58:16.061 --> 02:58:17.461]  This is the one thing I'm not sure about.
[02:58:17.461 --> 02:58:18.922]  I mean, I think it's good to listen to what he's saying.
[02:58:18.922 --> 02:58:21.643]  He's probably right, at least the next 5-10 years.
[02:58:21.643 --> 02:58:23.303]  But, I don't know.
[02:58:23.303 --> 02:58:25.084]  Keep going with your question.
[02:58:25.084 --> 02:58:26.304]  We're going to come back and he'll answer it.
[02:58:28.343 --> 02:58:30.345]  Anything else?
[02:58:30.345 --> 02:58:31.486]  No, I think it's a currency.
[02:58:31.486 --> 02:58:33.188]  All right, I'll get him to answer that.
[02:58:33.188 --> 02:58:34.610]  Some stations don't care the fourth hour.
[02:58:34.610 --> 02:58:36.071]  If not, they got great shows coming up.
[02:58:36.071 --> 02:58:38.954]  We'll be at Infowars.com forward slash show with the free feeds.
[02:58:38.954 --> 02:58:41.917]  Fourth hour coming up and then he'll be on the nightly news tonight.

[02:59:50.603 --> 03:00:07.187]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:07.187 --> 03:00:13.009]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.185 --> 03:00:20.968]  Alright, I'm going to get to that last caller's question with Mr. Dent in the few minutes we have left with him.
[03:00:20.968 --> 03:00:23.690]  And I'll try to then just ask some of the questions that I see up there on the board.
[03:00:23.690 --> 03:00:25.432]  We may get to more too.
[03:00:25.432 --> 03:00:29.975]  But I played a clip where Bush said, hey, you're not going to get the nomination, period.
[03:00:29.975 --> 03:00:32.037]  And actually showed what this guy really looks like.
[03:00:32.037 --> 03:00:36.881]  Because the nice boy act with the Bushes, believe me folks, it's just that, a complete act.
[03:00:36.881 --> 03:00:39.303]  These are hardcore people.
[03:00:39.303 --> 03:00:45.127]  And this is out of CNN, a quote of Jeb Bush, quote, I can guarantee you Donald Trump is not going to be the nominee.
[03:00:45.948 --> 03:00:49.011]  He added at the town hall in Husk said.
[03:00:49.011 --> 03:00:50.312]  So, so these are his other quotes.
[03:00:50.312 --> 03:00:58.459]  He said, and Mr. Dent was saying during the break, Harry Dent was saying, you know, I don't get why he's so arrogant and thinks he's going to stay in when he's 3%.
[03:00:58.459 --> 03:01:01.983]  Because they brag, they've got the delegates with the Republican machine.
[03:01:01.983 --> 03:01:05.486]  He got the biggest applauses because they let in his people.
[03:01:05.486 --> 03:01:07.287]  That's how sickening this is.
[03:01:07.287 --> 03:01:10.030]  Mr. Dent, your comments on that.
[03:01:10.030 --> 03:01:10.630]  Yeah, I mean.
[03:01:12.466 --> 03:01:19.268]  I feel like the whole political system's been hijacked by special interests, lobbying, and all this sort of stuff.
[03:01:19.268 --> 03:01:27.371]  And again, I mean, over 50% of the contributions to campaigns this year have come from like 30 families or something like that.
[03:01:27.371 --> 03:01:31.993]  So this thing, this power behind the scenes, we really don't have democracy.
[03:01:31.993 --> 03:01:34.454]  The central banks have taken over the free markets.
[03:01:35.254 --> 03:01:39.858]  And special interests, and money has taken over democracy.
[03:01:39.858 --> 03:01:43.821]  So I do not like these trends, when this sort of backroom stuff can happen.
[03:01:43.821 --> 03:01:51.586]  You were telling me the reason you like Bloomberg is, and I've heard this from other folks, that when you're in his offices, it's the most happening, jumping, hard-working place you've ever seen.
[03:01:51.586 --> 03:01:52.747]  It is the most.
[03:01:52.747 --> 03:01:57.651]  The main reason, I was for Romney back last time, because we need a turnaround manager.
[03:01:57.651 --> 03:02:03.015]  The economy's going to fail, and we need somebody to say, okay, in failure, we need... I used to be a turnaround manager.
[03:02:03.015 --> 03:02:04.376]  That's what we did at Bain & Company.
[03:02:05.737 --> 03:02:12.546]  You come in, and you reassess stuff, and you make radical changes, and you can only make such radical changes when things are... What do you think of Fiorina?
[03:02:12.546 --> 03:02:14.168]  What sort of person?
[03:02:14.168 --> 03:02:16.390]  I mean, I remember following it.
[03:02:16.390 --> 03:02:19.414]  Didn't she just manage a takeover and kind of a looting?
[03:02:19.414 --> 03:02:21.516]  I mean, what a great lady she was.
[03:02:21.516 --> 03:02:23.739]  She just took the company and merged it with another one.
[03:02:23.739 --> 03:02:24.120]  I don't get it.
[03:02:24.760 --> 03:02:27.281]  Yeah, well, you know, I think they're understating the good.
[03:02:27.281 --> 03:02:29.401]  I think she walked in a difficult situation.
[03:02:29.401 --> 03:02:33.582]  But no, she does not have a tracker to say, I can turn something around.
[03:02:33.582 --> 03:02:38.183]  Michael Bloomberg, I think, or a Mitt Romney would be that type of president.
[03:02:38.183 --> 03:02:40.224]  Well, I like Mitt Romney a lot better than Hillary Clinton.
[03:02:40.224 --> 03:02:41.984]  Bloomberg and the gun thing, that's just a veto there.
[03:02:41.984 --> 03:02:45.985]  But I appreciate your view on that, and I've heard it from other smart people that Bloomberg is a smart cookie.
[03:02:47.045 --> 03:02:51.467]  He just wants to enslave me when he has bodyguards so he can go right to hell in my view.
[03:02:51.467 --> 03:02:54.109]  Let's get into that whole question about gold.
[03:02:54.109 --> 03:02:56.410]  Is it a commodity or is it a currency?
[03:02:56.410 --> 03:02:59.151]  Okay, it was a currency up to the early 70s.
[03:02:59.151 --> 03:03:00.051]  It no longer is.
[03:03:00.051 --> 03:03:07.515]  You can't take a Krugerrand down a store and buy something or buy an airline ticket or something like that or even, you know, take it overseas with you.
[03:03:08.155 --> 03:03:12.699]  It is a potential currency again, but there's not enough gold in the world.
[03:03:12.699 --> 03:03:15.501]  Olympic-sized swimming pool would hold all the gold in the world.
[03:03:15.501 --> 03:03:21.766]  How do you back a global economy that is so many times bigger and growing so much faster than gold supply is?
[03:03:21.766 --> 03:03:24.288]  So, gold used to be a good backing.
[03:03:24.288 --> 03:03:25.389]  I don't see it being a currency.
[03:03:25.389 --> 03:03:28.812]  Well, my problem is they can then manipulate that with fractional reserve banking again.
[03:03:29.392 --> 03:03:34.576]  Well, I mean, again, I think gold's a great thing to have in a basket of backups.
[03:03:34.576 --> 03:03:37.598]  People that just think it's going to absolutely save them forever.
[03:03:37.598 --> 03:03:40.581]  I mean, I think it's just part of a larger plan.
[03:03:40.581 --> 03:03:45.885]  Well, the question you have to ask yourself, we have printed more money than any time in history.
[03:03:45.885 --> 03:03:47.406]  Nobody would have expected this much.
[03:03:47.406 --> 03:03:49.788]  Ten trillion minimum around the world.
[03:03:49.788 --> 03:03:51.309]  And gold continues to fall.
[03:03:51.309 --> 03:03:53.911]  Well, they admit they're naked shorting it.
[03:03:53.911 --> 03:03:55.252]  It would be against that.
[03:03:55.252 --> 03:03:56.533]  They admit they're driving it down, though.
[03:03:56.533 --> 03:03:58.215]  That's come out just like LIBOR and all of it.
[03:03:58.775 --> 03:04:00.496]  Yeah, but they're manipulating all markets.
[03:04:00.496 --> 03:04:03.657]  The stock market's, you know, still going up in certain things.
[03:04:03.657 --> 03:04:11.120]  Gold, I'm telling you, it's... I think the truth is in between what you say and then what somebody like Peter Schiff says.
[03:04:11.120 --> 03:04:17.482]  I mean, I don't think gold is as bad as you say or silver, but I do see the manipulation and I do agree with you about deflation.
[03:04:17.482 --> 03:04:20.263]  But I mean, down the road, I don't know how they're going to suppress the price.
[03:04:20.623 --> 03:04:21.844]  Plus it's industrial usage.
[03:04:21.844 --> 03:04:26.887]  But again, the Peter Schiff's have been saying, and consistently say, the dollar's gonna go to zero and gold's gonna go to 5,000.
[03:04:26.887 --> 03:04:29.369]  This is not happening.
[03:04:29.369 --> 03:04:31.230]  Mark my words, it will not happen.
[03:04:31.230 --> 03:04:33.471]  I will quit my profession if that happens.
[03:04:33.471 --> 03:04:34.692]  Well, you've been really accurate.
[03:04:34.692 --> 03:04:38.634]  So, we're gonna sit back and watch, and Harry Dent, thank you so much.
[03:04:38.634 --> 03:04:40.556]  The book is free with shipping, $4.95.
[03:04:40.556 --> 03:04:43.157]  It's not like $15 shipping to get the book free.
[03:04:43.157 --> 03:04:44.518]  It's actually a free book.
[03:04:44.518 --> 03:04:46.339]  It actually loses, what, $4 or $5 out of that?
[03:04:46.339 --> 03:04:46.720]  Oh, yeah.
[03:04:47.500 --> 03:04:48.944]  Yeah, so it's a loss leader.
[03:04:48.944 --> 03:04:50.749]  Check it out, harrynet.com.
[03:04:50.749 --> 03:04:51.591]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:04:51.591 --> 03:04:54.881]  Straight ahead, David Knight from the Situation Room.
[03:04:54.881 --> 03:04:55.723]  I'm in the War Room.
[03:04:58.829 --> 03:05:08.453]  The LAPD and private security are targeting random people with stop-and-frisk searches on public sidewalks before the premiere of Star Wars The Force Awakens.
[03:05:08.453 --> 03:05:15.656]  Police have also installed metal detectors on the sidewalks near the famous TCL Chinese Theater in Hollywood, California.
[03:05:15.656 --> 03:05:19.738]  Someone took to Twitter to post a picture of a Wookiee having his bag searched.
[03:05:19.738 --> 03:05:24.620]  The caption reads, security will be tight for the latest hashtag Star Wars premiere tonight.
[03:05:24.620 --> 03:05:26.201]  Metal detectors have been set up.
[03:05:26.801 --> 03:05:37.889]  TMZ reported, LAPD and private security officers are already blanketing several square blocks around the famed Chinese theater where the Force Awakens event is going down.
[03:05:37.889 --> 03:05:44.053]  We've learned anyone strolling through the area could be searched, frisked, and even wanted with metal detectors.
[03:05:44.053 --> 03:05:51.978]  In other words, even people not associated with the event who are simply passing through a public area are subject to a warrantless search.
[03:05:51.978 --> 03:05:55.541]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[03:05:58.379 --> 03:06:12.986]  My fellow patriots, one of the things I'm most proud of is the fact that the InfoWars operation reaches more than 20 million people a week worldwide with the message of liberty and none of it is funded by major global corporations or by taxpayers.

[03:08:06.033 --> 03:08:10.096]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:08:10.096 --> 03:08:16.639]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:16.639 --> 03:08:19.961]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[03:08:19.961 --> 03:08:20.762]  I'm David Knight.
[03:08:20.762 --> 03:08:22.003]  I'll be your host this hour.
[03:08:22.003 --> 03:08:23.884]  Joining me in the studio right now is Leanne McAdoo.
[03:08:23.884 --> 03:08:27.526]  We're going to talk a little bit about last night's debate.
[03:08:27.526 --> 03:08:35.411]  Of course, as we saw Chris Christie getting on his Dr. Strangelove, talking about what he would do to Russia if they
[03:08:36.011 --> 03:08:44.215]  Uh, flu in a country where they've been invited by Syria to patrol there, as well as by Iran, neighboring countries, saying, yeah, I would shoot them down.
[03:08:44.215 --> 03:08:49.218]  We're going to assert ourselves into this country and we're going to shoot down the Russians.
[03:08:49.218 --> 03:08:50.418]  Absolutely insane.
[03:08:50.418 --> 03:08:54.160]  Rand Paul called him on that insanity.
[03:08:54.160 --> 03:09:00.003]  But at the same time they were doing that, we had the FAA come out and say they're going to turn
[03:09:00.823 --> 03:09:02.825]  America into a no-fly zone.
[03:09:02.825 --> 03:09:04.927]  Of course, we've got the list where people can't fly on planes.
[03:09:04.927 --> 03:09:05.847]  I'm not talking about that.
[03:09:05.847 --> 03:09:08.089]  I'm not talking about the Star Chamber list.
[03:09:08.089 --> 03:09:20.120]  I'm talking about the fact that the FAA has now given themselves the authority to say that if you fly a drone, and by that they mean anything that is a half pound and up, that's something that will fit in the palm of your hand,
[03:09:20.720 --> 03:09:23.242]  They take it upon themselves to give you a civil fine of $27,500.
[03:09:23.242 --> 03:09:32.448]  Now, of course, that's a civil fine, so they don't even have to take you to court, give you any due process, because they called it civil.
[03:09:32.448 --> 03:09:37.191]  If they want to come after you with a criminal charge, they can get up to a quarter of a million dollars.
[03:09:37.191 --> 03:09:44.555]  So I'm going to talk about that at the bottom of the hour, but I want to ask Leanne about her take on the debate last night.
[03:09:44.555 --> 03:09:45.476]  Leanne, what did you think?
[03:09:46.104 --> 03:09:54.952]  Well wow, just speaking on that FAA ruling, that's pretty incredible because think about all the parents that are going to be buying those little drones for their, you know, stocking stuffers and things like that.
[03:09:54.952 --> 03:09:57.635]  So make sure you get those registered.
[03:09:57.635 --> 03:10:03.380]  Register your children, register their toys, register everything because the government's got a list, who's naughty and nice.
[03:10:04.101 --> 03:10:09.067]  Well actually, one of our guys was just in there having to do a software update for our drone.
[03:10:09.067 --> 03:10:10.348]  It wouldn't even work.
[03:10:10.348 --> 03:10:11.329]  And so there you go.
[03:10:11.329 --> 03:10:12.771]  See, that's the whole point.
[03:10:12.771 --> 03:10:17.497]  They can put GPS fencing in to keep these things away from the airports.
[03:10:17.497 --> 03:10:20.841]  But no, they want to take the route where they can control you the most.
[03:10:20.841 --> 03:10:21.182]  Right.
[03:10:21.182 --> 03:10:22.223]  Or just shut your drone down.
[03:10:22.503 --> 03:10:23.723]  Yes, it's registered.
[03:10:23.723 --> 03:10:29.325]  Well, obviously I think the debate was pretty spectacular last night and I enjoyed covering it once again.
[03:10:29.325 --> 03:10:41.629]  I think it was the third most watched debate ever, so I'm pretty happy to know that there are a lot of people tuning in, paying attention, getting involved in politics at this point, even though they're really trying to dumb us down.
[03:10:41.629 --> 03:10:49.811]  But I wanted to go ahead and play Rand Paul's opening statements because we kind of got to our live coverage a little bit late, so we missed it.
[03:10:50.171 --> 03:10:57.458]  Yeah, he was the very first one to speak and introduce, and we got only the tail end of it where he reminded everybody that it was the anniversary of the Bill of Rights.
[03:10:57.458 --> 03:11:01.662]  Right, and he just came out swinging like, hey, you're running for president?
[03:11:01.662 --> 03:11:03.804]  Well, there's this little thing called the Constitution.
[03:11:03.804 --> 03:11:05.465]  Let me remind you about it.
[03:11:05.465 --> 03:11:07.227]  Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[03:11:07.227 --> 03:11:11.531]  The question is, how do we keep America safe from terrorism?
[03:11:11.531 --> 03:11:14.114]  Trump says we ought to close that internet thing.
[03:11:15.874 --> 03:11:18.377]  The question really is, what does he mean by that?
[03:11:18.377 --> 03:11:20.158]  Like they do in North Korea?
[03:11:20.158 --> 03:11:22.220]  Like they do in China?
[03:11:22.220 --> 03:11:27.045]  Rubio says we should collect all Americans' records all of the time.
[03:11:27.045 --> 03:11:29.348]  The Constitution says otherwise.
[03:11:29.348 --> 03:11:30.489]  I think they're both wrong.
[03:11:30.489 --> 03:11:34.253]  I think we defeat terrorism by showing them that we do not fear them.
[03:11:35.253 --> 03:11:44.638]  I think if we ban certain religions, if we censor the internet, I think that at that point the terrorists will have won.
[03:11:44.638 --> 03:11:46.839]  Regime change hasn't won.
[03:11:46.839 --> 03:11:52.943]  Toppling secular dictators in the Middle East has only led to chaos and the rise of radical Islam.
[03:11:52.943 --> 03:11:58.806]  I think if we want to defeat terrorism, I think if we truly are sincere about defeating terrorism,
[03:12:00.031 --> 03:12:02.872]  We need to quit arming the allies of ISIS.
[03:12:02.872 --> 03:12:10.536]  If we want to defeat terrorism, the boots on the ground need to be Arab boots on the ground.
[03:12:10.536 --> 03:12:14.158]  As Commander-in-Chief, I will do whatever it takes to defend America.
[03:12:15.287 --> 03:12:20.874]  But in defending America, we cannot lose what America stands for.
[03:12:20.874 --> 03:12:22.876]  Today is the Bill of Rights anniversary.
[03:12:22.876 --> 03:12:26.501]  I hope we will remember that and cherish that in the fight on terrorism.
[03:12:26.501 --> 03:12:27.081]  Thank you, Senator.
[03:12:27.081 --> 03:12:28.383]  You couldn't have a better opening.
[03:12:28.383 --> 03:12:29.624]  He hit all the points.
[03:12:29.624 --> 03:12:34.410]  And we have to understand that America is more than just borders.
[03:12:35.271 --> 03:12:47.299]  America is fundamentally the idea that government's purpose is to protect our rights, and you don't hear any other candidate talking about rights, about liberty, about the Bill of Rights, except for Rand Paul.
[03:12:47.299 --> 03:13:02.569]  He clearly understands what's going on, and he clearly understands that even though they spent all last night talking about how they're going to go to war with ISIS, how they're going to contain ISIS, he clearly understands, and will openly say it, that we are the ones who are creating this problem.
[03:13:02.569 --> 03:13:05.091]  We created ISIS, we fund it, and we continue to fund it.
[03:13:05.171 --> 03:13:14.440]  Stop accidentally dropping weapons to ISIS and stop arming the so-called moderate rebels who turn out to be jihadis joining ISIS.
[03:13:14.440 --> 03:13:18.204]  So yeah, I mean he called it came out swinging with that.
[03:13:18.204 --> 03:13:19.945]  So I wanted to go ahead and talk a little bit about
[03:13:20.546 --> 03:13:21.968]  Trump shutting down the Internet.
[03:13:40.848 --> 03:13:42.128]  Oh, they want to do that very hard.
[03:13:42.128 --> 03:13:42.528]  Yes, they do.
[03:13:42.528 --> 03:13:44.329]  They're trying to do that very hard, yeah.
[03:14:04.795 --> 03:14:09.597]  They're going to arrange to make announcements for the IP addresses that are owned by Islamic State.
[03:14:09.597 --> 03:14:15.798]  Any traffic intended for Islamic State on about 95% of the internet could be redirected to the U.S.
[03:14:15.798 --> 03:14:17.299]  and then null routed.
[03:14:17.299 --> 03:14:23.101]  Essentially, dumping it into a black hole, perhaps after being analyzed by the NSA or the military.
[03:14:23.101 --> 03:14:23.761]  Problem solved.
[03:14:24.588 --> 03:14:29.311]  Well, you know, it isn't an issue, Leanne, of how the technology is going to work.
[03:14:29.311 --> 03:14:35.294]  And, of course, what he tries to do here is to sound like he knows something by using a few technical terms.
[03:14:35.294 --> 03:14:37.155]  I'm not impressed by jargon, okay?
[03:14:37.155 --> 03:14:38.256]  I've been an engineer.
[03:14:38.256 --> 03:14:39.476]  I see how people use this.
[03:14:39.476 --> 03:14:42.558]  I've seen with the climate debate how people use appeals to authority.
[03:14:42.558 --> 03:14:43.779]  Trust me, I'm a Ph.D., whatever.
[03:14:44.159 --> 03:14:48.304]  He made some pretty amazingly ridiculous statements in here.
[03:14:48.304 --> 03:14:52.668]  He said all the internet service providers that together comprise the core of the internet are all American.
[03:14:52.668 --> 03:14:54.390]  Well, that's actually not true.
[03:14:54.390 --> 03:14:56.772]  There are internet service providers in every single country.
[03:14:56.772 --> 03:14:58.995]  Which is why China is able to...
[03:14:59.335 --> 03:15:06.361]  Exactly, that's where we're headed with this, is to emulate what China is doing with their great firewall.
[03:15:06.361 --> 03:15:10.705]  And so it's not a question of pragmatics, it's not a question of how the technology works.
[03:15:10.705 --> 03:15:13.208]  So yeah, you can do anything with the technology.
[03:15:13.208 --> 03:15:21.135]  You can completely shut down the internet, you can do it with, you know, rubber hose and guns in people's faces, or you can do it finesse with technology.
[03:15:21.135 --> 03:15:22.436]  The issue is the principles.
[03:15:22.856 --> 03:15:27.701]  The issue is free speech, which this guy is clearly clueless about, who's writing for Breitbart.
[03:15:27.701 --> 03:15:29.282]  He really doesn't understand it.
[03:15:29.282 --> 03:15:39.833]  But you know, Leanne, as this debate is going on, as we were talking about that yesterday, there was a conference in China promoting the Chinese ideal of censorship.
[03:15:39.833 --> 03:15:42.355]  And let me read to you what Fortune Magazine said.
[03:15:42.355 --> 03:15:46.640]  They said, China is selling a censored, walled-off internet.
[03:15:47.440 --> 03:15:51.742]  They want the, there's a world conference, China's world conference that began yesterday.
[03:15:51.742 --> 03:15:53.663]  They said it's a total farce.
[03:15:53.663 --> 03:15:58.864]  It's an event where China hopes to use its speech to spread the idea of censorship.
[03:15:58.864 --> 03:15:59.485]  Okay?
[03:15:59.485 --> 03:16:03.746]  An internet that's walled off from the world through censorship and firewalls.
[03:16:03.746 --> 03:16:08.148]  And they talk about how they've banned Facebook, they've banned Twitter, WordPress, Instagram.
[03:16:08.148 --> 03:16:13.250]  They used to ban Google, but now Google has kowtowed, literally, to what China wants to do.
[03:16:13.490 --> 03:16:14.832]  Now they're allowed in.
[03:16:14.832 --> 03:16:21.521]  The human rights activists, the internet activists, everybody knows precisely what China is doing.
[03:16:21.521 --> 03:16:28.811]  They are exercising what they call their sovereignty in the name of security and safety.
[03:16:28.811 --> 03:16:29.692]  Why did they do this?
[03:16:30.052 --> 03:16:40.556]  Well, they had a train accident back in 2011 in one of the cities, and the Chinese government wanted to float this false narrative about what had happened with the train accident.
[03:16:40.556 --> 03:16:45.417]  And it scared them to death because the truth came out on social media.
[03:16:45.417 --> 03:16:46.958]  It's a threat to China.
[03:16:46.958 --> 03:16:49.498]  It's not a threat to the Chinese people to have free speech.
[03:16:49.498 --> 03:16:51.099]  It's a threat to the Chinese government.
[03:16:51.099 --> 03:16:53.140]  It's a threat to tyrants to have free speech.
[03:16:53.140 --> 03:16:57.141]  That's why it's the very first thing that is enumerated in the Bill of Rights is free speech.
[03:16:57.661 --> 03:17:03.562]  All the internet groups, all the technical people, all the human rights groups recognize that what China is doing is censorship.
[03:17:03.562 --> 03:17:10.364]  And what Donald Trump is calling about in terms of just, well we're just going to cut off this part of the internet and we're going to wall off that area over there.
[03:17:10.364 --> 03:17:13.905]  He wants to put a wall at the border, thinks he can keep people out with that.
[03:17:13.905 --> 03:17:18.386]  He thinks he can shut down terrorism with a great firewall just like China.
[03:17:18.386 --> 03:17:19.706]  It isn't going to work in either place.
[03:17:19.946 --> 03:17:22.929]  Well, and as we've seen, you know, give an inch, they're going to take a mile.
[03:17:22.929 --> 03:17:27.112]  You set the precedent that they can shut down internet access in one area.
[03:17:27.112 --> 03:17:33.678]  Well, they've already ignored Islamic terror threat before San Bernardino to focus on right-wing radicals.
[03:17:33.678 --> 03:17:39.844]  So those people were able to slip through the cracks because this administration thinks that those are not the terrorists.
[03:17:39.844 --> 03:17:42.406]  The real terrorists are these right-wing radicals.
[03:17:42.406 --> 03:17:42.907]  And that's the point.
[03:17:43.387 --> 03:17:47.988]  The conservatives always sell this to the right wing because they're going to buy into the idea of safety.
[03:17:47.988 --> 03:17:50.148]  They're the ones who love, well of course the left does as well.
[03:17:50.148 --> 03:17:51.069]  They all want safety.
[03:17:51.069 --> 03:17:52.929]  Nobody cares about liberty anymore.
[03:17:52.929 --> 03:18:03.451]  And then you have to understand that the Southern Poverty Law Center and the government are constantly, constantly, we report on this virtually weekly, how they say, you know, the real threat to America is not Islamic terrorism.
[03:18:03.451 --> 03:18:05.751]  Please don't be scared of the Muslims, okay?
[03:18:05.751 --> 03:18:10.612]  Be afraid of the conservatives, okay?
[03:18:10.612 --> 03:18:13.233]  The homegrown conservatives who don't like the government.
[03:18:13.553 --> 03:18:14.794]  That's your real enemy.
[03:18:14.794 --> 03:18:19.297]  And folks, what they're going to do is they're going to shut down conservative libertarian media with this.
[03:18:19.297 --> 03:18:22.419]  You give them this tool, and that's the way they're going to hammer it.
[03:18:22.419 --> 03:18:27.883]  And that's what people need to understand, because a lot of people, even in the comments section, were like, well, what do you prefer, InfoWars?
[03:18:27.883 --> 03:18:30.245]  You just think that they should leave the internet open and not...
[03:18:31.085 --> 03:18:31.866]  And so that's it.
[03:18:31.866 --> 03:18:44.035]  You've got to pay attention to this because this is what they use, ISIS, to stir everyone up into fear so that we will give up our rights even though everyone knows and we've been fighting for this free and open internet.
[03:18:44.035 --> 03:18:51.981]  That's why New World Order's had to really ramp up its plans because the internet gives people all over the world access to truth.
[03:18:51.981 --> 03:18:55.483]  We're over 14 years into this Patriot Act idiocy, okay?
[03:18:55.483 --> 03:18:56.024]  Are you safer?
[03:18:56.624 --> 03:19:03.445]  We've had bigger terrorist attacks than we ever had outside of what they did at 9-11 with this most recent one.
[03:19:03.445 --> 03:19:07.266]  And of course we're told that, you know, they knew all about them but, you know, they were just watching them.
[03:19:07.266 --> 03:19:12.447]  Look, I have no problem with them surveilling people if they're foreigners.
[03:19:12.447 --> 03:19:15.748]  That's what the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was for.
[03:19:15.748 --> 03:19:18.789]  I have a problem with them surveilling Americans without a search warrant.
[03:19:18.789 --> 03:19:20.209]  That's what the Constitution is for.
[03:19:20.489 --> 03:19:27.274]  They have flipped this upside down, and then when they fail, they argue that they want to expand this even further.
[03:19:27.274 --> 03:19:29.055]  That now they've got to take control of the Internet.
[03:19:29.055 --> 03:19:30.396]  They've taken control.
[03:19:30.396 --> 03:19:31.476]  They frisk us at the airports.
[03:19:31.476 --> 03:19:32.377]  They do all this.
[03:19:32.377 --> 03:19:33.458]  Stay with us when we come back.
[03:19:33.458 --> 03:19:34.458]  Leanne's going to continue.
[03:19:34.458 --> 03:19:37.060]  We're not finished talking about the debate last night.
[03:19:37.060 --> 03:19:40.803]  We're also going to talk about what was said about the Gang of Eight.
[03:19:40.803 --> 03:19:47.367]  And of course, one of the Gang of Eight, Senator McCain, is now going to have a challenge coming up in Arizona.
[03:19:47.367 --> 03:19:49.308]  Let's make it a Gang of Seven.
[03:19:49.308 --> 03:19:50.009]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:50.009 --> 03:19:50.409]  Stay with us.
[03:19:59.073 --> 03:20:02.674]  Winter has just begun and are you already tired of being cold?
[03:20:02.674 --> 03:20:04.495]  How would you like to never be cold again?

[03:20:58.413 --> 03:21:06.757]  We have been fighting this war tirelessly with you at our side, day in and day out, exposing the ludicrous lies and criminal operations of the globalists.
[03:21:06.757 --> 03:21:09.079]  And we're starting to see big effects.
[03:21:09.079 --> 03:21:10.960]  And the word is getting out.
[03:21:10.960 --> 03:21:13.041]  The globalists want to make us dependent.
[03:21:13.041 --> 03:21:16.783]  And as Napoleon famously said, an army marches on its stomach.
[03:21:16.783 --> 03:21:22.265]  Ammunition, food, and supplies form the backbone of any offensive, including the Info War.
[03:21:22.265 --> 03:21:25.227]  And our enemies admit they're losing the Info War.
[03:21:25.467 --> 03:21:29.209]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[03:21:29.209 --> 03:21:35.711]  With this in mind, we have held strong to our principles and the decision to refuse any money from globalists or government.
[03:21:35.711 --> 03:21:42.454]  We are funding our crusade against tyranny the old-fashioned way, with pure free-market, free-will capitalism.

[03:21:58.194 --> 03:22:01.316]  Still wondering what to get that special someone that has everything?
[03:22:01.316 --> 03:22:11.462]  At ID Stronghold, we still find that a huge percentage of people do not yet have an RFID blocking wallet or purse to protect them from the new and growing threat of electronic pickpocketing.
[03:22:11.462 --> 03:22:24.791]  That's right, even though 40% of all new chipped payment cards shipped in 2014 contain a wireless interface called RFID that allows the account information to be skimmed by a thief passing near your cards, most people are still unprotected.
[03:22:25.191 --> 03:22:30.933]  The good news is that ID Stronghold makes luxurious leather wallets and other products that prevent this.
[03:22:30.933 --> 03:22:39.896]  ID Stronghold founded the entire RFID protection industry and has been protecting the RFID chips in government and military ID cards for over a decade.
[03:22:39.896 --> 03:22:45.838]  So go to idstronghold.com and get that loved one a stylish leather RFID blocking wallet or clutch.
[03:22:45.838 --> 03:22:47.539]  That's idstronghold.com.
[03:22:47.859 --> 03:22:50.702]  After all, wallets and purses have always been a great gift.

[03:23:53.430 --> 03:23:56.874]  From all of us here at SupernaturalSilver.com.
[03:24:07.278 --> 03:24:08.539]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:08.539 --> 03:24:11.040]  I'm David Knight and joining me now in the studio is Leanne McAdoo.
[03:24:11.040 --> 03:24:17.644]  We're going to talk about the back and forth between Rubio and Rand Paul about the immigration bill.
[03:24:17.644 --> 03:24:18.744]  Who wants to open the borders?
[03:24:18.744 --> 03:24:22.166]  How do they want to or do they even want to try to control immigration?
[03:24:22.166 --> 03:24:24.728]  I would say that Rubio clearly does not.
[03:24:24.728 --> 03:24:32.532]  He's worked on these bills with Chuck Schumer, co-sponsored one, and talk to the audience about the Gang of Eight.
[03:24:32.532 --> 03:24:33.893]  Define that a little bit for people, Leanne.
[03:24:34.864 --> 03:24:40.445]  Well, also, too, let's not forget that Jeb Bush publicly endorsed the Gang of Eight amnesty bill.
[03:24:40.445 --> 03:24:48.046]  So, you know, I thought it was hilarious when Donald Trump called him out on his brother flying bin Laden family out right after 9-11.
[03:24:48.046 --> 03:24:49.567]  Yes, that was perfect.
[03:24:49.567 --> 03:24:50.507]  That was perfect.
[03:24:50.507 --> 03:24:53.867]  And then, of course, Jeb's response was, well, you're not a serious candidate.
[03:24:53.867 --> 03:25:00.069]  You know, if you pull back the curtain and show that the emperor has no clothes, then you're not a serious candidate.
[03:25:00.069 --> 03:25:02.209]  Now you're real serious when you do that sort of thing.
[03:25:02.449 --> 03:25:03.429]  Right.
[03:25:03.429 --> 03:25:23.455]  So the Senate Gang of Eight Immigration Bill, it was written to provide a path to citizenship, the DREAM Act as well, the family visas that would move along that backlog a lot faster, and then of course enforcement so they would, you know, add even more people there for this border surge and everything.
[03:25:24.875 --> 03:25:28.898]  At the time, Marco Rubio, he doubled down on this failed Gang of Eight bill.
[03:25:28.898 --> 03:25:30.138]  They said, hypothetical do-over.
[03:25:30.138 --> 03:25:31.519]  Would you do this again?
[03:25:31.519 --> 03:25:32.940]  And he said, absolutely.
[03:25:32.940 --> 03:25:35.482]  He would push for these same policies.
[03:25:35.482 --> 03:25:44.648]  And he basically said that he was right in predicting that failure to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill would result in executive action from the president.
[03:25:44.648 --> 03:25:49.130]  So, pass this to find out what's in it, or else we're going to get executives.
[03:25:50.051 --> 03:25:59.555]  And the reason they called them a gang was because this is a bipartisan movement of Republican and Democrat senators to basically shut down any amendments, any pushback against that.
[03:25:59.555 --> 03:26:03.877]  And that's part of what they were going back and forth about was the amendments that had been shut down.
[03:26:03.877 --> 03:26:04.958]  And remember who was in this.
[03:26:04.958 --> 03:26:09.220]  Of course, it was Chuck Schumer, the guy who wants to take your guns, okay, always.
[03:26:09.220 --> 03:26:11.281]  That's one of the key places where he hangs out.
[03:26:11.281 --> 03:26:15.002]  It was John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio, okay?
[03:26:15.002 --> 03:26:18.044]  So, you know, keep those names in mind, okay?
[03:26:18.404 --> 03:26:19.104]  We're good to go.
[03:26:43.018 --> 03:26:54.447]  Once again, I thought he hit it out of the park with this where he called out Marco Rubio for having more allegiance to Chuck Schumer and the Democrats than he does to conservative principles.
[03:26:54.447 --> 03:26:55.608]  So let's go ahead and play that clip.
[03:26:56.801 --> 03:27:04.347]  The other thing is, the one thing that might have stopped Senator Bernardino, that might have stopped 9-11, would have been stricter controls on those who came here.
[03:27:04.347 --> 03:27:10.752]  And Marco has opposed, at every point, increased security, border security, for those who come to our country.
[03:27:10.752 --> 03:27:21.280]  On his Gang of Eight bill, he would have liberalized immigration, but he did not, and he steadfastly opposed any new border security requirements for refugees or students.
[03:27:22.120 --> 03:27:27.362]  Last week, I introduced another bill saying we need more security, we need more scrutiny.
[03:27:27.362 --> 03:27:29.202]  Once again, Marco opposed this.
[03:27:29.202 --> 03:27:30.722]  So Marco can't have it both ways.
[03:27:30.722 --> 03:27:37.524]  He thinks he wants to be this, oh I'm great and strong on national defense, but he's the weakest of all the candidates on immigration.
[03:27:37.524 --> 03:27:41.145]  He is the one for an open border that is leaving us defenseless.
[03:27:41.145 --> 03:27:44.266]  If we want to defend the country, we have to defend against who's coming in.
[03:27:44.266 --> 03:27:50.388]  And Marco has more of an allegiance to Chuck Schumer and to the liberals than he does to conservative policy.
[03:27:53.570 --> 03:27:54.571]  So, I mean, that's good.
[03:27:54.571 --> 03:28:00.694]  You know, you can't have both liberty and, I mean, you have to have liberty and security.
[03:28:00.694 --> 03:28:04.176]  And they're trying to have us give up our liberty for safety.
[03:28:04.176 --> 03:28:05.537]  You know, that was the drinking game last night.
[03:28:05.537 --> 03:28:12.502]  Well, you know, I understand a lot of libertarians who are concerned about border patrols, border controls in general.
[03:28:12.502 --> 03:28:13.462]  And I understand that.
[03:28:13.462 --> 03:28:21.047]  I mean, we had a situation in this country where our borders were open for, you know, most of the life of the republic until we became an empire.
[03:28:21.667 --> 03:28:24.509]  But you have to understand that the problem with that is the welfare state.
[03:28:51.607 --> 03:28:52.788]  We're good to go.
[03:29:20.205 --> 03:29:22.787]  And you were very quick to point all that out last night.
[03:29:22.787 --> 03:29:27.191]  Can we play 30 seconds of that last clip?
[03:29:27.191 --> 03:29:30.074]  My favorite highlight?
[03:29:30.074 --> 03:29:30.935]  You can run a little bit of it.
[03:29:30.935 --> 03:29:32.696]  Go ahead.
[03:29:32.696 --> 03:29:33.337]  We'll go out with this.
[03:29:36.909 --> 03:29:39.071]  I guess they don't have a hold up.
[03:29:39.071 --> 03:29:39.591]  But that's alright.
[03:29:39.591 --> 03:29:40.592]  Yeah, that's what you pointed out.
[03:29:40.592 --> 03:29:41.893]  It's about freedom.
[03:29:41.893 --> 03:29:42.734]  Thank you, Leigh-Anne.
[03:29:42.734 --> 03:29:48.138]  We'll be right back and I'm going to talk about this new encroachment on our freedom that is absolutely insane.
[03:29:48.138 --> 03:29:49.399]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.399 --> 03:29:51.000]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.000 --> 03:29:54.603]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.427 --> 03:30:05.793]  That's right, the Feds are coming to town.
[03:30:05.793 --> 03:30:09.317]  The FAA has just sent their dictate throughout the land.
[03:30:09.317 --> 03:30:15.864]  Any motorized planes heavier than a half pound, I repeat, a half pound, will have to be registered by December 21st.
[03:30:15.864 --> 03:30:20.989]  If Santa gives you one, you can't fly it outside without registering it on their list.
[03:30:21.249 --> 03:30:28.873]  Fail to do so, and the FAA will fine you $27,500 without due process, calling it a civil fine.
[03:30:28.873 --> 03:30:36.256]  If they come after you criminally, quarter of a million dollars and three years in jail for not registering your half pound and heavier plane.
[03:30:36.656 --> 03:30:41.937]  This regulation won't do anything to enforce the current prohibitions of flying close to airports.
[03:30:41.937 --> 03:30:45.518]  And they should be concerned if they can't protect airports from toy planes.
[03:30:45.518 --> 03:30:50.359]  Because that means they certainly can't protect airports from shoulder-fired missiles.
[03:30:50.359 --> 03:30:51.159]  And guess what?
[03:30:51.159 --> 03:30:54.400]  The jihadis won't be registering those with the FAA.

[03:33:12.119 --> 03:33:13.261]  Big Brother.
[03:33:13.261 --> 03:33:15.044]  Mainstream media.
[03:33:15.044 --> 03:33:16.967]  Government cover-ups.
[03:33:16.967 --> 03:33:18.670]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:33:18.670 --> 03:33:20.313]  Well, so does he.
[03:33:20.313 --> 03:33:24.900]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:29.873 --> 03:33:31.095]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:31.095 --> 03:33:32.677]  I'm David Nye, your host.
[03:33:32.677 --> 03:33:39.025]  I want to talk about what's going on with this insane expansion power grab of the FAA.
[03:33:39.025 --> 03:33:42.329]  It's very parallel actually to what's going on with the FCC.
[03:33:42.329 --> 03:33:45.693]  And I want to talk about these parallels because we need to understand.
[03:33:46.474 --> 03:33:54.060]  What we saw sold to us last night, and I think one of the persons who does this the most is Ted Cruz.
[03:33:54.060 --> 03:33:59.324]  Donald Trump is much better at pointing out that this has been going on a long time.
[03:33:59.324 --> 03:34:06.969]  Going back to the Bush administration, most of these big problems that we're faced with right now, of course we've had, this has been going on far longer than that.
[03:34:06.969 --> 03:34:12.513]  And that is the out-of-control bureaucracy, as well as the policies that we've been pursuing abroad.
[03:34:13.334 --> 03:34:22.718]  But we're told constantly by Ted Cruz that this is something that Obama has done, that Hillary will continue, and as long as we get rid of Obama and don't elect Hillary, everything is just going to be fine.
[03:34:22.718 --> 03:34:23.939]  No, it isn't.
[03:34:23.939 --> 03:34:32.223]  There are some horrible systemic issues with the federal government, especially with the bureaucracy, that persist regardless of who is elected.
[03:34:32.223 --> 03:34:36.125]  And that's why we need to not get overly distracted by a presidential election.
[03:34:36.906 --> 03:34:44.528]  We need to make sure that we stay focused on the things that we can do to contain the federal government, because it will not contain itself.
[03:34:44.528 --> 03:34:50.029]  We need to take back our liberties, and there are ways that we can do that without picking up a gun right now.
[03:34:50.029 --> 03:35:04.012]  But our windows are starting to close, and so we need to educate people about what they can do with jury nullification, about what can be done at the state and local level to nullify the effect of the federal government when it steps into places that it has absolutely no authority.
[03:35:04.172 --> 03:35:05.533]  So we're going to talk about that.
[03:35:05.533 --> 03:35:08.376]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to tell you about our specials.
[03:35:08.376 --> 03:35:10.898]  We have free shipping all this week.
[03:35:10.898 --> 03:35:15.803]  There's only three days left for that to get to guaranteed Christmas delivery as well.

[03:35:48.208 --> 03:35:55.356]  And of course, we've got a lot of other specials on knick-knacks and other things that are great to look at for stocking stuffers.
[03:35:55.356 --> 03:35:59.900]  Again, you can get free shipping on everything at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:35:59.900 --> 03:36:05.186]  We've got another three days left on that and it's guaranteed Christmas delivery if you get it by Friday.
[03:36:06.584 --> 03:36:10.266]  Before I get to the drone issue, I just want to point out a couple of quick news articles.
[03:36:10.266 --> 03:36:11.387]  We mentioned one of them briefly.
[03:36:11.387 --> 03:36:20.413]  We were talking about the Gang of Eight, the fact that that included not only Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham, who are running for president, but also John McCain.
[03:36:20.413 --> 03:36:29.959]  John McCain has pointed out on Drudge Report that he now has somebody who is going to be challenging him for his seat, Arizona State Senator Kelly Ward.
[03:36:30.639 --> 03:36:32.862]  She is a physician in Arizona.
[03:36:32.862 --> 03:36:38.127]  She says she's resigning her Senate seat to devote all of her energy to defeating McCain.
[03:36:38.127 --> 03:36:39.989]  Of course, she's been there for five terms.
[03:36:39.989 --> 03:36:45.375]  My question that I jotted down on this is, well, will the Tea Party darling Sarah Palin once again
[03:36:46.776 --> 03:36:50.839]  Stumped for him, putting her pals over her principals.
[03:36:50.839 --> 03:36:57.445]  And that's what we've seen her do in the past when there was some real credible threat to get rid of this very, very dangerous man.
[03:36:57.445 --> 03:37:04.751]  I mean, another guy just like Chris Christie, belligerent and on the verge of insanity in terms of his militancy.
[03:37:04.751 --> 03:37:09.255]  The things that he would do for the military industrial complex, just as we saw Chris Christie last night.
[03:37:09.995 --> 03:37:17.398]  A jaw-dropping admission that he would make declarations over Syria and shoot down Russian planes if they violate it.
[03:37:17.398 --> 03:37:20.520]  Because, you know, he can draw the line anywhere he wishes.
[03:37:20.520 --> 03:37:23.001]  That's the kind of authoritarian guy he is.
[03:37:23.001 --> 03:37:27.083]  Of course, he's hopelessly in love with the war on drugs.
[03:37:28.311 --> 03:37:29.652]  He's prosecuted people for it.
[03:37:29.652 --> 03:37:43.659]  He says he's going to come after people in the states, like Colorado, Washington, Oregon, where they have gotten rid of drug prohibition for marijuana, you know, because that's the way authoritarians roll.
[03:37:43.659 --> 03:37:48.661]  Just like he said he would tell Russia what to do, and he would start World War III if they don't obey his orders.
[03:37:48.661 --> 03:37:56.025]  Well, he's going to go into these states that have legalized marijuana for medical use, for recreational use, and he's going to start putting people in jail.
[03:37:56.874 --> 03:37:57.675]  Great.
[03:37:57.675 --> 03:38:02.418]  Now, we were told that the Republicans were going to oppose Obama on climate change.
[03:38:02.418 --> 03:38:04.579]  We heard a lot of really strong talk.
[03:38:04.579 --> 03:38:06.720]  And of course, they had the Paris Climate Agreement.
[03:38:06.720 --> 03:38:08.582]  It was passed this last weekend.
[03:38:08.582 --> 03:38:11.503]  It didn't take long for the Republicans to cave.
[03:38:11.503 --> 03:38:13.245]  Here it is, Wednesday.
[03:38:13.245 --> 03:38:22.851]  And they have now passed the money for Obama to do what he wants to in terms of starting to hand out the cash to the crony capitalists as part of this climate deal.
[03:38:23.351 --> 03:38:34.716]  In a victory for the Obama administration, the spending package released by congressional leaders on Wednesday won't block American financial contributions to an international climate fund for poorer nations.
[03:38:34.716 --> 03:38:44.300]  They say this legislation doesn't formally block money for the Green Climate Fund, so Obama is expected to be able to use current discretionary funding streams to send American money to it.
[03:38:44.300 --> 03:38:46.401]  Now this is not what we were promised by the Republicans.
[03:38:47.230 --> 03:39:02.316]  During negotiations over an international climate deal, the GOP said it would work to block GFC, that's the Green Climate Fund, and any omnibus bill unless the Senate got a chance to vote on ratifying the climate agreement.
[03:39:02.316 --> 03:39:03.917]  But it was just talk.
[03:39:03.917 --> 03:39:05.198]  But here's the talk that they said.
[03:39:05.198 --> 03:39:09.840]  Here's one example of one Republican congressman, or senator from Wyoming.
[03:39:09.840 --> 03:39:10.140]  He said,
[03:39:10.760 --> 03:39:17.183]  Congress will weigh in on whatever comes out of the Paris climate talks and the money that the President has requested as part of the budget.
[03:39:17.183 --> 03:39:18.284]  Yeah, they weighed in.
[03:39:18.284 --> 03:39:20.345]  They said, here, you can have it, no strings attached.
[03:39:20.345 --> 03:39:21.086]  No problem.
[03:39:21.086 --> 03:39:22.146]  Do whatever you want.
[03:39:22.146 --> 03:39:26.348]  You know, you're God, or you're Caesar, depending on what you want to do.
[03:39:26.348 --> 03:39:30.791]  If you want to make pronouncements about religion, or if you want to go to war, go ahead.
[03:39:30.791 --> 03:39:33.412]  You can do whatever you want, and the Congress will not oppose you.
[03:39:33.412 --> 03:39:35.173]  And you know who else they won't oppose?
[03:39:35.173 --> 03:39:37.194]  They will not oppose the bureaucracy.
[03:39:37.194 --> 03:39:38.195]  What we've seen happening
[03:39:38.815 --> 03:39:55.349]  With this insane law that the FAA has put out, and they've given everybody a deadline of December the 21st, what this is, is nothing but another petty-fogging bureaucracy granting itself authority that it doesn't have.
[03:39:55.349 --> 03:39:57.151]  We've seen this with the FCC.
[03:39:57.151 --> 03:40:03.916]  The FCC is trying to take control of the Internet in total, and that's why I'm so sensitive to what Donald Trump is doing.
[03:40:03.916 --> 03:40:06.699]  When he wants to replicate the patterns that are happening in China,
[03:40:07.159 --> 03:40:15.842]  And of course, this idiot from Breitbart, he says, well, unless you're a total moron, you understand that what Donald Trump is talking about is geography.
[03:40:15.842 --> 03:40:27.186]  He's like, if you are a total moron, if you think the internet is limited to geography, if you think people can't spoof where they're coming from, you think they can't reroute stuff, you don't even understand the technology.
[03:40:27.186 --> 03:40:30.828]  And he writes this whole article talking about how it would work.
[03:40:30.828 --> 03:40:32.909]  I don't care how it would work.
[03:40:32.909 --> 03:40:33.629]  It shouldn't work.
[03:40:34.249 --> 03:40:40.714]  Just like I don't care about messing with the details of taking people's guns away if they're on the no-fly list.
[03:40:40.714 --> 03:40:43.716]  You shouldn't have a no-fly list.
[03:40:43.716 --> 03:40:48.260]  If people have done something wrong, then you take them to trial.
[03:40:48.260 --> 03:40:53.203]  You don't put them on a list and then start punishing them without due process.
[03:40:53.203 --> 03:40:57.387]  That is incredibly idiotic, moronic, foolish.
[03:40:57.387 --> 03:40:58.628]  We shouldn't be doing that sort of thing.
[03:40:58.628 --> 03:41:00.069]  But let's get back to these bureaucracies.
[03:41:00.882 --> 03:41:08.048]  The FCC came out, and of course, this is all focusing, people get tied up with the details of net neutrality.
[03:41:08.048 --> 03:41:10.009]  Folks, this isn't about net neutrality.
[03:41:10.009 --> 03:41:15.154]  We could argue about net neutrality just like we could argue about free trade and the transatlantic and transpacific partnerships.
[03:41:15.851 --> 03:41:19.292]  Those partnerships are not about trade.
[03:41:19.292 --> 03:41:23.954]  It's about establishing a new, overreaching control.
[03:41:23.954 --> 03:41:29.616]  It's about a new organization, about consolidating control into a global governance.
[03:41:29.616 --> 03:41:34.458]  And these regulations, all this going back and forth between the FCC Commission and the
[03:41:36.371 --> 03:41:40.972]  The appeals judge, a panel of three judges are looking at this.
[03:41:40.972 --> 03:41:45.633]  This is all simply about them asserting authority into a new area.
[03:41:45.633 --> 03:41:47.493]  It doesn't really have anything to do with net neutrality.
[03:41:47.493 --> 03:41:50.353]  The FCC's been on both sides of net neutrality.
[03:41:50.353 --> 03:41:51.674]  Understand that.
[03:41:51.674 --> 03:41:57.255]  So it's not about net neutrality, it's not about free trade, it's about creating control for a new body.
[03:41:57.255 --> 03:41:59.915]  And that is what the FAA is doing as well.
[03:41:59.915 --> 03:42:04.736]  When the FCC, I'm not finished with the FCC, let's talk about how this came about.
[03:42:05.543 --> 03:42:16.657]  First they came out and they had some net neutrality rulings and they were slapped down by a judge and said you don't have the right to try to regulate content.
[03:42:16.657 --> 03:42:18.639]  You only have the right to regulate utilities.
[03:42:18.639 --> 03:42:20.402]  You were created to allocate spectrum.
[03:42:21.378 --> 03:42:30.987]  To say, okay, these people are going to have this frequency on the radio, and these are going to have these frequencies on television, so we're going to allocate that, we're going to have an auction, we're going to put that off.
[03:42:30.987 --> 03:42:34.991]  But now they're trying to regulate content on the Internet.
[03:42:34.991 --> 03:42:39.155]  So the judge says, you know, you don't have authority to do that, you're just there to regulate utilities.
[03:42:39.155 --> 03:42:44.580]  So the FCC comes back and says, okay, we have now pronounced that the Internet is a utility.
[03:42:44.580 --> 03:42:45.461]  Done!
[03:42:45.461 --> 03:42:46.201]  Done!
[03:42:46.201 --> 03:42:46.482]  Voila!
[03:42:47.122 --> 03:42:48.402]  Problem solved.
[03:42:48.402 --> 03:42:55.044]  And, of course, the judges come back and say, uh, yeah, okay, okay, you say it's a utility, so now you can regulate it.
[03:42:55.044 --> 03:42:56.145]  Just that simple.
[03:42:56.145 --> 03:43:00.566]  What we're seeing happening with the FAA is exactly the same thing.
[03:43:00.566 --> 03:43:02.846]  And let me go back to how this started.
[03:43:02.846 --> 03:43:08.108]  We had a situation where the FAA got angry with a guy who was a Swiss citizen, I believe.
[03:43:08.108 --> 03:43:08.928]  His name is Perker.
[03:43:08.928 --> 03:43:11.769]  And I think he was in New York, if my memory serves me correctly.
[03:43:11.769 --> 03:43:13.449]  I'm just going off of memory on this.
[03:43:13.449 --> 03:43:14.210]  I think he was in New York.
[03:43:14.210 --> 03:43:14.790]  He was, nevertheless,
[03:43:15.905 --> 03:43:31.280]  He took some pictures with a very very lightweight styrofoam drone and they got upset about it and they fined him because I think what the FAA was trying to do was they figured they had some low-hanging fruit because they could come after a guy who was not an American citizen
[03:43:31.880 --> 03:43:33.661]  And he would not really fight them in court.
[03:43:33.661 --> 03:43:36.543]  He would just roll over or go away, and they could get a conviction.
[03:43:36.543 --> 03:43:46.188]  I mean, they've done these types of things when they encroached on the Second Amendment, when they talked about, remember the sawed-off shotgun laws, and they had the guy that they were coming after, he died.
[03:43:46.188 --> 03:43:50.831]  And so they made a ruling about this, even after the guy died, and there was nobody to argue his side of the case.
[03:43:50.831 --> 03:43:54.152]  They made a ruling and then set a precedent on that.
[03:43:54.152 --> 03:43:58.375]  So, I think they thought they could do the same thing with this Swiss citizen, Perker.
[03:43:59.400 --> 03:44:02.862]  Now, what happened was, when this went before a law judge, he fought it.
[03:44:02.862 --> 03:44:06.205]  He said, no, no, no, I'm not going to have you impose this fine on me.
[03:44:06.205 --> 03:44:09.307]  Maybe he wanted to come back to the United States, or maybe he just understood principle.
[03:44:09.307 --> 03:44:12.969]  Because, you know, Americans don't seem to understand principle anymore.
[03:44:12.969 --> 03:44:13.870]  But he fought it.
[03:44:13.870 --> 03:44:16.652]  He went to a law judge that ruled in his favor.
[03:44:17.532 --> 03:44:22.916]  And said that the FAA didn't have jurisdiction over model planes.
[03:44:22.916 --> 03:44:39.910]  And he said that the FAA's position that they're taking would, quote, lead to the risible argument that a flight in the air, for example, of a paper aircraft or a toy balsa wood glider, could subject the operator to the regulatory provisions of these new laws that they've put in place, okay?
[03:44:40.825 --> 03:44:48.802]  And so the NTSB, so that's what the judge said, he basically laughed at it and said, you're going to try to regulate model planes?
[03:44:49.861 --> 03:44:50.761]  You're the FAA.
[03:44:50.761 --> 03:44:53.343]  You don't have the authority to regulate model planes.
[03:44:53.343 --> 03:44:55.344]  So then the FAA appealed it.
[03:44:55.344 --> 03:44:57.605]  They took it before the National Transportation Safety Board.
[03:44:57.605 --> 03:45:05.068]  And the NTSB panel of three judges, here we are, three judges again, unelected, unaccountable, say, no, they can do that.
[03:45:05.068 --> 03:45:06.409]  They can do that.
[03:45:06.409 --> 03:45:14.193]  And so now what we have, well, now there's a, let's go to, that was November of last year.
[03:45:14.193 --> 03:45:15.554]  Let's go to August of this year.
[03:45:16.567 --> 03:45:20.250]  And what we had was a lawyer out of Connecticut.
[03:45:20.250 --> 03:45:21.651]  His name is Peter Sachs.
[03:45:21.651 --> 03:45:24.673]  He's founded the Drone Pilots Association.
[03:45:24.673 --> 03:45:31.138]  And he is a critic of the FAA's power grab over drones, over toy planes.
[03:45:31.138 --> 03:45:41.646]  So what he did was he, to illustrate the absurdity of this, he got the agency to approve a powered paper airplane for commercial drone operations, just to make a point.
[03:45:42.802 --> 03:45:49.166]  And what he did was he sent this to the FAA, and they actually, with a straight face, gave him a permit for this.
[03:45:49.166 --> 03:45:53.408]  Now let me tell you what this paper drone is.
[03:45:53.408 --> 03:45:57.431]  It is a drone from Power Up Toys, 3.0 drone.
[03:45:57.431 --> 03:45:57.811]  It's about $50.
[03:45:57.811 --> 03:46:00.653]  It's sold by a toy company out of Israel.
[03:46:00.653 --> 03:46:04.895]  They started with a Kickstarter campaign, raised about $1.2 million.
[03:46:04.895 --> 03:46:07.657]  They sold 120,000 units of the toy.
[03:46:07.657 --> 03:46:08.537]  It is a toy.
[03:46:08.537 --> 03:46:09.358]  Okay?
[03:46:09.358 --> 03:46:10.979]  Very tiny paper airplane.
[03:46:11.519 --> 03:46:18.522]  They say it won't even lift a camera, the battery gives out in 10 minutes, and then, as they put it, it is a child of the wind.
[03:46:18.522 --> 03:46:19.082]  Okay?
[03:46:19.082 --> 03:46:27.005]  They thought the ruling of the FAA was hysterical because what they did was they gave this guy, he applied for a permit, said, hey, I'd like to use this for commercial use.
[03:46:27.005 --> 03:46:38.189]  He applied for the permit and they granted him permission to use this paper airplane and say, yeah, we really do have the authority to look at model airplanes and to regulate them.
[03:46:38.882 --> 03:46:45.489]  Because they had come out with regulations that said that if you're going to fly this, you have to be a registered pilot.
[03:46:45.489 --> 03:46:52.236]  They've got all kinds of regulations in terms of who can fly these drones if it's done commercially.
[03:46:52.236 --> 03:46:53.918]  And of course you have to have a licensed pilot.
[03:46:54.739 --> 03:47:16.132]  And so he points out that even though they gave him permission now, they've granted him permission to fly this $50 paper airplane with a little tiny motor that won't lift a camera, the battery gives out in 10 minutes, they granted him a operator permission, but now, because he's using it for commercial use, he still needs to have a pilot who meets certification rules that the FAA just put on about a year ago.
[03:47:16.852 --> 03:47:35.292]  And even though this guy is an out-of-certification helicopter pilot, he flew real helicopters, he flew a jet ranger helicopter, but now he would have to hire somebody to fly this paper airplane or he would be in violation of the FAA's rules.
[03:47:35.292 --> 03:47:37.074]  Now the FAA is not laughing.
[03:47:38.089 --> 03:47:48.017]  Tyrants everywhere don't have a sense of humor, they don't have a sense of shame, they don't have a sense of irony, and they could care less what our rights are.
[03:47:48.017 --> 03:47:50.680]  They could care less what the law is.
[03:47:50.680 --> 03:47:53.001]  Now, what have they regulated?
[03:47:53.001 --> 03:48:04.171]  They have told everybody that you've got until December the 21st, and then if you are 13 years of age or older, and then if the kid has this, if he doesn't register, they'll come after the parents, of course.
[03:48:04.738 --> 03:48:12.420]  But anything that is a half a pound up to 55 pounds, you will have to register with the FAA.
[03:48:12.420 --> 03:48:22.282]  If you do not register with the FAA, you are liable to having a $27,500 civil penalty.
[03:48:22.282 --> 03:48:26.464]  Now that civil word is very important that you understand that.
[03:48:26.464 --> 03:48:31.785]  Understand that when they talk about it being a civil penalty and not a criminal penalty,
[03:48:32.816 --> 03:48:38.126]  That means they can assess that to you without having to give you any due process.
[03:48:38.126 --> 03:48:43.676]  They say, well, the Constitution only talks about having due process if it's a criminal action.
[03:48:44.864 --> 03:48:47.686]  Okay, so they just treat you as a criminal.
[03:48:47.686 --> 03:48:51.208]  They assess the fines without charging you with a crime.
[03:48:51.208 --> 03:48:55.111]  They don't want to give you a day in court because they don't want to have to prove that you did anything wrong.
[03:48:55.111 --> 03:49:03.797]  They don't want a jury to look at this and say, well, wait a minute, we also have the, besides the 5th and 6th Amendment, we also have the 8th Amendment about excessive fines.
[03:49:03.797 --> 03:49:05.018]  Do you think it's excessive?
[03:49:05.898 --> 03:49:15.003]  That your child, or you, would be fined $27,500 simply because you did not register?
[03:49:15.003 --> 03:49:16.544]  You haven't done anything wrong.
[03:49:16.544 --> 03:49:21.147]  You simply flew this outside of a building.
[03:49:21.147 --> 03:49:23.248]  Right inside your house.
[03:49:23.248 --> 03:49:24.008]  You took it outside.
[03:49:24.008 --> 03:49:25.549]  You open it up on Christmas Day.
[03:49:25.549 --> 03:49:27.751]  You take it outside and you fly it.
[03:49:27.751 --> 03:49:30.332]  If the FAA knows, they can assess a $27,000 fine to you.
[03:49:32.313 --> 03:49:33.093]  Is that insane?
[03:49:33.093 --> 03:49:44.958]  It gets even more insane because if you did something criminally, and I don't know what they would consider to be criminal, a $250,000 fine and imprisonment of up to three years in jail.
[03:49:44.958 --> 03:49:48.559]  Now, you need to understand that they are capable of putting
[03:49:49.580 --> 03:49:50.461]  GPS locations.
[03:49:50.461 --> 03:49:51.241]  They've already done this.
[03:49:51.241 --> 03:50:02.711]  Many drone manufacturers have already put GPS location inhibitors in their drones to make sure that they do not get within the FAA restricted area close to an airport.
[03:50:02.711 --> 03:50:08.416]  They have restrictions, and I forget how many miles it is you have to be away from an airport, but that's very easily done with technology.
[03:50:08.956 --> 03:50:17.867]  You could very easily keep these things from getting anywhere close to an airport, keep them from getting anywhere close to a certain elevation.
[03:50:17.867 --> 03:50:19.029]  That's not a problem.
[03:50:19.029 --> 03:50:23.194]  But they want to take the approach of the maximum control.
[03:50:23.194 --> 03:50:25.056]  That's what our government always does.
[03:50:25.737 --> 03:50:36.679]  And we need to understand that, as I pointed out at the very beginning of this, this is not something that is going to go away if we get rid of Obama and don't elect Hillary.
[03:50:36.679 --> 03:50:44.480]  This is an out-of-control bureaucracy that grants itself permission, just as we see the FCC doing it, we see the FAA doing it.
[03:50:44.480 --> 03:50:52.642]  They grant themselves permission, they create the penalties, they accuse you with their police, they bring you before their court if you even get a day in court.
[03:50:52.642 --> 03:50:53.722]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back.
[03:50:59.522 --> 03:51:01.503]  My name is Don Whiskin.
[03:51:01.503 --> 03:51:06.466]  In 1994, I lost my 62-year-old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:51:06.466 --> 03:51:10.468]  In 1977, my 44-year-old brother was found dead in his apartment.
[03:51:10.468 --> 03:51:12.029]  He suffered a heart attack.
[03:51:12.029 --> 03:51:15.931]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed.
[03:51:15.931 --> 03:51:20.693]  21 days later, my 53-year-old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital.
[03:51:20.693 --> 03:51:21.534]  He waited too long.
[03:51:21.954 --> 03:51:25.335]  In June, that same year, I almost joined them at 42.
[03:51:25.335 --> 03:51:26.216]  What did I do?
[03:51:26.216 --> 03:51:33.679]  I took a 7-herb formula I now call ExtendoVite made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, hawthorn, milk thistle, and valerian.
[03:51:33.679 --> 03:51:41.822]  Based on German studies of natural medicine, ExtendoVite is designed to clear blocked arteries, clean the toxins from your blood, and improve your immune system.
[03:51:42.102 --> 03:51:43.884]  To get your XtendoVite, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:43.884 --> 03:51:44.505]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:44.505 --> 03:51:46.768]  Or visit our website, heartdrop.com.
[03:51:58.562 --> 03:52:02.264]  Soon Christmas would have come and gone, and with it, 2015.
[03:52:02.264 --> 03:52:07.166]  Now is the time to give the gift of amazing health this Christmas and New Year's season.

[03:52:28.197 --> 03:52:28.597]  I think so.

[03:54:19.110 --> 03:54:21.931]  And we have some additional Christmas specials there as well.

[03:54:59.653 --> 03:55:00.674]  Wake up America!
[03:55:01.494 --> 03:55:02.315]  A lot of specials.
[03:55:02.315 --> 03:55:03.856]  You'll see those on our website.
[03:55:03.856 --> 03:55:05.518]  And again, free shipping.
[03:55:05.518 --> 03:55:10.343]  And you still have three days left to get it for guaranteed Christmas delivery.
[03:55:12.165 --> 03:55:19.849]  As I was talking about what the FAA is doing, what the FCC is doing, understand that as all of this is happening, what is our Congress doing?
[03:55:19.849 --> 03:55:24.692]  They're giving the green light to Obama to do whatever he wants to with this climate change deal.
[03:55:24.692 --> 03:55:35.898]  Just as they told us, oh don't worry, they didn't have any mandates in there, they didn't enact any carbon taxes that are going to be paid to some international tribunal, that was on the table folks, that was part of the draft.
[03:55:35.898 --> 03:55:40.481]  But no, they're not going to do any of that, Obama wanted that, but they're just going to go with voluntary stuff, so guess who volunteered?
[03:55:41.181 --> 03:55:44.324]  The GOP just rolled over and gave it to him.
[03:55:44.324 --> 03:55:55.174]  Just like they're rolling over and giving permission to all of these federal bureaucracies, whether it's the EPA, whether it's the FCC, whether it's FAA, allowing them to write law.
[03:55:55.174 --> 03:55:56.856]  See, Congress doesn't do anything anymore.
[03:55:56.856 --> 03:55:59.278]  I don't know, why don't we just send these guys home?
[03:55:59.278 --> 03:56:01.160]  All they're doing is feathering their nest.
[03:56:01.160 --> 03:56:02.922]  They're supposed to write the laws.
[03:56:03.482 --> 03:56:05.003]  We elect them to write the laws.
[03:56:05.003 --> 03:56:07.144]  We're supposed to have representatives write the law.
[03:56:07.144 --> 03:56:12.547]  But instead, we have bureaucracies that persist regardless of who is president.
[03:56:12.547 --> 03:56:13.248]  Let me repeat that.
[03:56:13.248 --> 03:56:20.732]  Regardless of who is president, these bureaucracies continue to persist and they metastasize like a cancer.
[03:56:20.732 --> 03:56:30.237]  So now we've got the FAA saying you've got a half-pound toy that you can fit in the palm of your hand, costs less than $50, register it or we're going to, if we catch you, you've always got this hanging over your head.
[03:56:30.237 --> 03:56:32.058]  They can use this as a weapon against anybody.
[03:56:32.058 --> 03:56:33.139]  Yeah, you can ignore it.
[03:56:33.719 --> 03:56:36.881]  Okay, figure that you're not going to get caught, but they use this as a weapon.
[03:56:36.881 --> 03:56:37.581]  And they can clamp.
[03:56:37.581 --> 03:56:38.602]  You don't think they're going to do that?
[03:56:38.602 --> 03:56:45.965]  Look at what the EPA did to the fellow who built a little pond on his eight acres.
[03:56:45.965 --> 03:56:49.387]  None of the water went across the border of his property.
[03:56:49.387 --> 03:56:50.487]  He created the pond.
[03:56:50.487 --> 03:56:51.128]  He dug it out.
[03:56:51.128 --> 03:56:53.089]  He filled it with water for his livestock, for his kids.
[03:56:53.089 --> 03:56:55.270]  They assessed fines against him of $37,500 per day.
[03:56:58.351 --> 03:57:06.317]  So if the EPA can do that to a guy in Montana with eight acres, they can do that to you with your kid's toy drone.
[03:57:06.317 --> 03:57:09.119]  And of course, the Congress won't do anything to stop them.
[03:57:09.119 --> 03:57:11.540]  So we have to stop them at the state level.
[03:57:11.540 --> 03:57:13.381]  We have to stop them with jury trials.
[03:57:13.381 --> 03:57:19.446]  We need to demand that they're not going to take our money and call it a civil action without giving us a jury trial.
[03:57:19.986 --> 03:57:25.390]  Folks, we have to understand, they're coming after our freedoms and they pretty much have knocked all the walls down.
[03:57:25.390 --> 03:57:26.490]  It's kind of like we're at the Alamo.
[03:57:26.490 --> 03:57:27.471]  Most of the walls are down.
[03:57:27.471 --> 03:57:29.813]  We're being shelled by Santa Ana.
[03:57:29.813 --> 03:57:32.014]  But we can't give this up.
[03:57:32.014 --> 03:57:33.956]  We may only have one wall left.
[03:57:33.956 --> 03:57:35.837]  But we need to fight for the First Amendment.
[03:57:35.837 --> 03:57:37.598]  We need to fight for the Second Amendment.
[03:57:37.598 --> 03:57:39.239]  And we need to take this back.
[03:57:39.239 --> 03:57:43.482]  And we need to say that we're not going to abandon the station.
[03:57:43.482 --> 03:57:46.124]  Now, before we go, and I just want to underscore this.
[03:57:46.124 --> 03:57:47.445]  Some of the guys wanted me to play this.
[03:57:47.445 --> 03:57:48.786]  This is a clip from last night.
[03:57:49.742 --> 03:57:51.563]  Well, I was essentially saying the same thing.
[03:57:51.563 --> 03:57:58.188]  And then we're going to go out with this clip, let you know that tonight is the Infowars Nightly News with Jakari Jackson, 7 Central, 8 PM Eastern.
[03:57:58.188 --> 03:57:59.669]  Let's run this clip and we'll go out with that.
[03:57:59.669 --> 03:58:00.630]  Exactly.
[03:58:00.630 --> 03:58:05.714]  When a politician tells you that he's going to take away your freedom of speech, believe him, he's going to take it away.
[03:58:05.714 --> 03:58:06.975]  Right.
[03:58:06.975 --> 03:58:08.035]  It's not a fantasy.
[03:58:08.035 --> 03:58:10.197]  They lie to you all the time.
[03:58:10.197 --> 03:58:13.619]  Don't lie to yourself about what a politician is going to do.
[03:58:13.619 --> 03:58:18.523]  If he tells you he's a thief, if he tells you he's going to steal your rights, he's going to steal your damn rights!
[03:58:23.530 --> 03:58:25.755]  Don't believe that they're not going to do it.
[03:58:25.755 --> 03:58:29.964]  When they tell you they're going to take it, if it comes to your money or your rights, they will do that.
