[00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:10.284]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.284 --> 00:00:11.865]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:13.426]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:17.609]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.652]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.277 --> 00:00:49.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Worldwide Monday transmission, the 5th day of October 2015.
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:59.764]  Congressman Daniel Webster, who helped lead the operation to have Boehner announce that he was stepping down two weeks ago, will be joining us.
[00:00:59.764 --> 00:01:03.585]  He's part of the leadership fight for ascension to the Speakership of the House.
[00:01:04.065 --> 00:01:09.748]  Which is basically as important as the presidency to the United States, and a third in line with the presidency.
[00:01:09.748 --> 00:01:20.953]  If we get a patriot, paleo-conservative, constitutionalist, libertarian, veined individual into that position, it is a mega-massive game-changer.
[00:01:20.953 --> 00:01:26.616]  Five billion dollars, it's estimated, was spent on the last presidential campaign domestically alone.
[00:01:26.616 --> 00:01:29.177]  Billions of dollars foreign was spent as well.
[00:01:29.177 --> 00:01:30.558]  So let's say seven million dollars.
[00:01:31.664 --> 00:01:41.509]  There is literally almost no money, not even a million when I looked into it last night, that has been spent by different PACs and groups to try to get somebody in to replace Boehner.
[00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:52.135]  We're removing Boehner, but he's going before he becomes even more unpopular in his own admission to put in one of his little minions.
[00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:56.557]  So Congressman Daniel Webster will be joining us.
[00:01:56.557 --> 00:02:00.099]  Also in the fourth hour, Paul Joseph Watson will be hosting.
[00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.920]  I asked him this morning.
[00:02:02.554 --> 00:02:08.921]  What he was going to be covering, and turns out he's going to be covering one of the things I'm going to be covering today when he does the fourth hour.
[00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:16.302]  Pouring drain cleaner in your eyes, the next trendy social justice movement.
[00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:26.248]  This is on mainstream television, with a basic endorsement, and if you have sight now, it's hurtful, so you may have to lose your eyesight.
[00:02:26.248 --> 00:02:32.071]  Just like you can't say mother or father, or he or she, that's hurtful to those that do not consider themselves as sex.
[00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:35.834]  Your existence is evil.
[00:02:35.834 --> 00:02:40.637]  And I'm not kidding, I'm going to play the newscast, we're with a straight face, on Bancroft Television,
[00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:42.799]  This is the transabled.
[00:02:42.799 --> 00:03:05.248]  And I told you that the gouging out of the eyeballs, the chopping of the genitals off, the chopping of the arms and legs off, is super trendy and is spreading all over the world right now, and taxpayers must pay for it all, and the housing of what they call... I'm not even going to tell you what they call it, but people live in boxes with their arms and legs cut off and then wear diapers.
[00:03:06.298 --> 00:03:11.160]  And then the trendies dance around, and it's their religious sacrament.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.622]  And I'm not kidding when I talk about this.
[00:03:13.622 --> 00:03:15.903]  This is what you've got to accept.
[00:03:15.903 --> 00:03:17.824]  You're bigoted and you're hateful.
[00:03:17.824 --> 00:03:22.846]  And Nambla, of course, is out saying, give us your six-year-olds or you're not trendy and you're racist.
[00:03:22.846 --> 00:03:24.827]  And this is where it's all going.
[00:03:24.827 --> 00:03:26.748]  Oh, and by the way, our story's on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:03:28.157 --> 00:03:30.838]  They didn't do this just in one photo, they did it in two.
[00:03:30.838 --> 00:03:33.999]  I discovered this on Sunday and I wanted to have an article written about it.
[00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:36.480]  I didn't get around to telling the writers what we're going to do it.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.921]  Because I found another Photoshop where they did it as well.
[00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:44.323]  But they thought it was a little too much to remove his three black moles.
[00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:46.284]  They removed his moles.
[00:03:46.284 --> 00:03:49.845]  I guess those were too black because the guy's mixed race.
[00:03:49.845 --> 00:03:51.626]  He didn't kill folks because he was black and white.
[00:03:51.626 --> 00:03:54.267]  He killed them because he was a psychopathic anti-Christian trendy.
[00:03:56.818 --> 00:04:13.782]  CNN saying oh it's an accident you know that's just what we didn't really do that on purpose where they took a guy that clearly looks like he's part African and part Caucasian and part Hispanic or something and they turned him as white as a piece of tissue paper.
[00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.032]  He looks like Casper the Friendly Ghost.
[00:04:17.032 --> 00:04:19.534]  Like he's about to float through a wall or something.
[00:04:19.534 --> 00:04:23.377]  Casper the Friendly Ghost, friendliest ghost you know.
[00:04:23.377 --> 00:04:26.419]  He goes into the school with stolen guns.
[00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.441]  But he got illegal and shoots all the Christians.
[00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:31.283]  So it's the Christian Conservatives' fault.
[00:04:31.283 --> 00:04:33.504]  Obama loves you, because Casper said so.
[00:04:33.504 --> 00:04:38.448]  Excuse me, I'm just going a little too crazy here looking at this.
[00:04:38.448 --> 00:04:39.769]  So, that's all coming up.
[00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:43.412]  Hillary says she's the most transparent person in history.
[00:04:46.903 --> 00:04:48.065]  I think you're going to respond to that.
[00:04:48.065 --> 00:04:49.347]  It's got some bad news.
[00:04:49.347 --> 00:04:52.651]  The deal reached on Pacific Rim trade pact.
[00:04:52.651 --> 00:04:54.755]  Of course, they pitch it like it's a trade deal.
[00:04:54.755 --> 00:04:57.218]  It's a total world government being aligned right now.
[00:04:59.434 --> 00:05:01.595]  Kit Daniels, Infowars.com.
[00:05:01.595 --> 00:05:06.316]  CNN reportedly altered the photo of the biracial organ shooter to make him look more white.
[00:05:06.316 --> 00:05:08.996]  That's a shocking revelation, so let me repeat that.
[00:05:08.996 --> 00:05:14.738]  CNN apparently doctored the photo of the biracial organ shooter, Christopher Mercer, to make people think he's Caucasian.
[00:05:14.738 --> 00:05:23.500]  Mercer uploaded a selfie to social media, but when CNN used the photo in its news broadcast, Mercer's skin tone had dramatically changed to that of a white man.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.781]  Furthermore, CNN did not show photos of Mercer's mother, who is African American.
[00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:34.027]  And the network also didn't report that Mercer was involved in a school play, which contradicts the media's claim that he was a loner.
[00:05:34.027 --> 00:05:35.068]  Why would they do that?
[00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:41.415]  Because a biracial Oregon shooter does not fit into the establishment's propaganda that mass shooters are white racist men.
[00:05:41.415 --> 00:05:48.762]  They also don't want you to know that Mercer was associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, because it would be a political nightmare for Obama if the public knew the truth.
[00:05:49.002 --> 00:05:55.624]  It'd be hard for him to demand more gun control if more people start to realize that President Obama is fueling racial division across the U.S.
[00:05:55.624 --> 00:05:59.324]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels with Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:59.324 --> 00:06:05.066]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:06:05.066 --> 00:06:10.887]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds.
[00:06:10.947 --> 00:06:11.728]  I think so.
[00:06:33.348 --> 00:06:36.891]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:06:36.891 --> 00:06:41.034]  LiverShield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:45.357]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:06:45.357 --> 00:06:49.480]  LiverShield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.563]  Secure your LiverShield today exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com for the lowest price available.

[00:06:56.365 --> 00:06:56.745]  I want my candy!
[00:06:56.745 --> 00:06:57.886]  I want my baby again!
[00:06:57.886 --> 00:06:58.246]  My, my, my!
[00:07:02.458 --> 00:07:12.206]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:07:12.206 --> 00:07:14.909]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:18.472]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:07:18.472 --> 00:07:24.797]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[00:07:24.797 --> 00:07:29.621]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[00:07:29.901 --> 00:07:36.285]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[00:07:36.285 --> 00:07:44.030]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:51.574]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[00:07:51.574 --> 00:07:55.177]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:55.177 --> 00:07:58.118]  That's ChildEase exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:08:12.236 --> 00:08:17.240]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:24.085]  Out of my way, out of my day, out of your mind and into me.
[00:08:24.085 --> 00:08:31.131]  Into no one, into nothing, into your stability.
[00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:34.053]  It's wrong, what's wrong?
[00:08:34.053 --> 00:08:36.015]  I've already heard this song.
[00:08:43.177 --> 00:08:52.483]  We have a congressman joining us at the start of the next hour who is involved in the leadership battle or who will be the next speaker of the house.
[00:08:52.483 --> 00:08:54.305]  Couldn't be a more important subject.
[00:08:54.305 --> 00:08:58.868]  Congressman Daniel Webster will be popping in.
[00:08:58.868 --> 00:09:07.374]  We are obviously going to be covering the massive military developments and escalation of proxy war taking place in the Middle East via Syria.
[00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:15.092]  The TPP has been reached globally.
[00:09:15.092 --> 00:09:16.352]  The agreement has been reached.
[00:09:16.352 --> 00:09:25.856]  The Washington Post is reporting, but will remain secret from the public.
[00:09:25.856 --> 00:09:28.577]  Thought I'd pause on that one.
[00:09:28.577 --> 00:09:35.580]  Also, this little tidbit out of the New York Post, Delta Force considered staging fake hijacking after 9-11.
[00:09:39.155 --> 00:09:50.302]  Well, the truth is, there was a staged attack on an aircraft by Muttalib to bring in the naked body scanners, and we know that was staged.
[00:09:50.302 --> 00:09:56.545]  We know the CIA put the drugged youth on the aircraft so the firecracker could go off in his pants.
[00:09:56.545 --> 00:10:04.490]  Not so they could stop radical Islamic extremism, but so they could roll out the police state checkpoints against the American people while leaving the borders wide open.
[00:10:07.466 --> 00:10:25.131]  They've never caught one terrorist with all the TSA garbage and now the TSA was out for the Pope in three different cities setting up checkpoints up to five miles away and not letting cars travel on the streets anywhere after 9 30 p.m.
[00:10:25.131 --> 00:10:32.794]  Jakari Jackson and David Knight had to walk I think they said four plus miles to their hotel
[00:10:34.397 --> 00:10:36.238]  With their bags and equipment.
[00:10:36.238 --> 00:10:37.679]  In America.
[00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:41.062]  Because their plane landed at 9 o'clock at night.
[00:10:41.062 --> 00:10:45.185]  And they ran into military and TSA and border patrol.
[00:10:45.185 --> 00:10:48.427]  But none of them were on the border itself.
[00:10:48.427 --> 00:10:52.330]  That's coming up.
[00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.953]  Let me just read you some of the political correctness headlines today.
[00:10:58.382 --> 00:11:05.886]  Lesbian Swedish Bishop wants Christian crosses removed from churches to please Muslims.
[00:11:05.886 --> 00:11:15.470]  Replace the symbols with making and marking the direction of Mecca.
[00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.552]  So replace the crosses with Islamic symbols.
[00:11:18.552 --> 00:11:24.455]  To be politically correct, because your Christian culture is hurtful.
[00:11:24.455 --> 00:11:25.115]  Here's another one.
[00:11:26.343 --> 00:11:35.710]  Feminists fall for 4chan troll campaign by peeing themselves.
[00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:48.040]  4chan, the popular hacking site, put out the meme that feminists should urinate on themselves to prove that they're true feminists and of course they did it and posted the photos of themselves doing it in mass.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.323]  Let's continue with the political correctness news.
[00:11:51.323 --> 00:11:55.286]  CNN turns mixed-race Oregon shooter into a white man.
[00:11:56.087 --> 00:11:58.148]  That story is on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:11:58.148 --> 00:12:08.852]  LA Times claims Mercer was a white supremacist even though he was an admitted leftist who lived with his mommy and hated Christians.
[00:12:08.852 --> 00:12:17.115]  But now a guy that was part black and part white was turned white, and go back to it, his nose was made smaller.
[00:12:17.115 --> 00:12:21.977]  What, did he visit Michael Jackson's surgeon?
[00:12:21.977 --> 00:12:24.478]  Oh, but CNN now is saying it's an accident.
[00:12:26.266 --> 00:12:28.767]  It's an accident.
[00:12:28.767 --> 00:12:32.728]  And in other photos, they've been lightening his skin as well.
[00:12:32.728 --> 00:12:37.349]  And then you compare them.
[00:12:37.349 --> 00:12:39.410]  And then Obama is out blaming gun owners.
[00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:47.192]  Hillary has said that she's going to never relent, that's a quote, in the eradication of the Second Amendment.
[00:12:49.298 --> 00:12:51.380]  Oh, but it gets better!
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:56.925]  Just a few minutes before I went on air, Richard, one of the crew members, walked in and said, you never covered this, I noticed.
[00:12:56.925 --> 00:12:58.847]  Did you know about it?
[00:12:58.847 --> 00:13:07.515]  And I did know about it, but it's one of those things where I do most of my research at home, at my home office, and then I just tend to forget.
[00:13:07.515 --> 00:13:13.962]  Once I get up here to pull it back up, or I tend to send instant messages over to the crew of stories, but
[00:13:15.259 --> 00:13:21.343]  Obama administration and UN announced global police force to fight extremism in the U.S.
[00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:23.204]  That's Breitbart from the 29th.
[00:13:23.204 --> 00:13:24.605]  We're talking six days ago.
[00:13:24.605 --> 00:13:25.886]  I didn't cover it.
[00:13:25.886 --> 00:13:27.106]  Excuse me.
[00:13:27.106 --> 00:13:28.187]  I'm glad you pointed it out.
[00:13:28.187 --> 00:13:30.128]  I mean, people call up sometimes and go, why did you cover this?
[00:13:30.128 --> 00:13:31.869]  Because I didn't know so much.
[00:13:31.869 --> 00:13:32.510]  I don't know everything.
[00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:33.570]  I don't know a lot of stuff, folks.
[00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.012]  It's so much worse than I always say.
[00:13:36.012 --> 00:13:38.293]  Nine times out of 10, we're not exaggerating.
[00:13:38.293 --> 00:13:39.354]  It's worse than we're saying.
[00:13:42.398 --> 00:13:46.679]  That's what's crazy about it, is that it sounds like I'm exaggerating sometimes here.
[00:13:46.679 --> 00:13:51.060]  They are having the Stasi reactivated in Europe.
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.821]  In Germany.
[00:13:54.821 --> 00:13:57.862]  Like I said in the news today, they're officially turning it back on.
[00:13:57.862 --> 00:14:06.024]  Not just hiring former Stasi, just that Facebook's hiring former Stasi themselves, who then call the Stasi, this new German directorate made up of Stasi,
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.802]  Who then take your children away.
[00:14:09.802 --> 00:14:10.783]  That was in the news yesterday.
[00:14:10.783 --> 00:14:12.704]  We can pull that up from InfoWars.com.
[00:14:12.704 --> 00:14:17.508]  It links to mainstream German newspapers.
[00:14:17.508 --> 00:14:34.580]  Where, with a straight face, they say that the German bar is basically ordering people to be on the lookout who criticize open borders and that the children need to be taken from the parents.
[00:14:35.606 --> 00:14:38.447]  Because they're being taught cultural xenophobia.
[00:14:38.447 --> 00:14:42.489]  I mean, this is ultra-massive totalitarianism.
[00:14:42.489 --> 00:14:49.372]  So over-the-top, it makes my mind spin.
[00:14:49.372 --> 00:14:53.874]  But before I hit any of this incredible news, that's just some, that's just some.
[00:14:53.874 --> 00:14:56.115]  I covered three stacks here.
[00:14:56.115 --> 00:14:59.856]  I've got nine other stacks.
[00:14:59.856 --> 00:15:03.918]  Nine other stacks I haven't even mentioned to you that are just as insane.
[00:15:06.058 --> 00:15:19.987]  I want to explain why it's all happening today, because this is the key, one of many keys, but one of the key keys, the skeleton key, to understand why they're doing all this.
[00:15:19.987 --> 00:15:35.058]  When half the public is dying of cancer by 2030, and that's even in British newspapers, when half the newborn babies by 2030 or so have neurological disorders, autism spectrum disorders,
[00:15:36.323 --> 00:15:39.004]  This is the current CDC projection.
[00:15:39.004 --> 00:15:42.345]  One in three by 2025.
[00:15:42.345 --> 00:15:50.448]  When almost everyone you know is dead or dying or being kept alive by bizarre transmutagenic genetic engineering.
[00:15:50.448 --> 00:15:58.690]  So we're going to have to give up our humanity just to live because the globalists have treatments and cures for everything they're deploying against us.
[00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.431]  The stuff we see now is 50-year-old medicine.
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:08.686]  They're going to accelerate the rollout of life extension, you name it, and incredible designer drugs where the public won't care.
[00:16:08.686 --> 00:16:19.635]  It is going to be a total war on consciousness getting us ready for the singularity, the merger with machines, and the new creation.
[00:16:19.635 --> 00:16:20.776]  The globalists want to be God.
[00:16:20.776 --> 00:16:21.897]  They want to play God.
[00:16:21.897 --> 00:16:23.178]  They believe they're becoming gods.
[00:16:24.204 --> 00:16:25.264]  Every one of them says this.
[00:16:25.264 --> 00:16:33.086]  They have huge conferences where tens of thousands of billionaires and millionaires and rich people and stars go at closed resorts.
[00:16:33.086 --> 00:16:37.287]  You know, William Shatner comes and speaks and, you know, it's all exciting.
[00:16:37.287 --> 00:16:38.047]  It's fun.
[00:16:38.047 --> 00:16:39.227]  They're not even bad people.
[00:16:39.227 --> 00:16:43.348]  They're the level below the very top.
[00:16:43.348 --> 00:16:44.848]  They're the ones seduced in.
[00:16:44.848 --> 00:16:47.269]  And why wouldn't you be for life extension?
[00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:52.670]  Why wouldn't you be to be, you know, let in to all this advanced CIA
[00:16:55.174 --> 00:17:00.615]  Drugs, and everything else the elite have to offer.
[00:17:00.615 --> 00:17:05.576]  I mean, it's hard to not sell out to this satanic system.
[00:17:05.576 --> 00:17:12.858]  Believe me, I've got an idea, and I know some of the things they've got, and it's tempting.
[00:17:12.858 --> 00:17:16.439]  Very, very tempting, but I know it kills the soul.
[00:17:16.439 --> 00:17:20.240]  And I know it's a trap, and down the road, it is nothing but total darkness.
[00:17:24.073 --> 00:17:48.798]  But the reason they're doing this, the reason they are advertising the craziest stuff and pushing the weirdest things in the National Post in Canada saying taxpayers should pay for people to have their arms and legs cut off, and you're a trans-abled phobic
[00:17:49.983 --> 00:17:59.232]  Redneck if you don't want to pay to have somebody's arms and legs cut off and pay to have them kept in a government facility in a box so that their lover can come have sex with them.
[00:17:59.232 --> 00:18:09.041]  And I'm sorry to have to talk about stuff like this but this is the next wave to be force-fed down our throats.
[00:18:09.041 --> 00:18:15.487]  And so that's why they've got to normalize all this craziness so that things are so scrambled so that there's not any
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.603]  Rudder.
[00:18:18.603 --> 00:18:20.689]  Where anything goes.
[00:18:20.689 --> 00:18:23.757]  So we won't care when our neighbors are being drug off to a FEMA camp.
[00:18:24.887 --> 00:18:29.448]  So we won't care if they're putting psychotropics in all the kids' school lunches.
[00:18:29.448 --> 00:18:32.009]  That's what's being announced in the next phase.
[00:18:32.009 --> 00:18:35.470]  So we won't care when we're buying and selling with biometrics.
[00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:41.912]  So we won't care when half the people on the block are dying of cancer or neurological disorders.
[00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:45.854]  It's just got to be totally insane, whacked out wild.
[00:18:45.854 --> 00:18:48.935]  You're not going to have tax rebates for having kids.
[00:18:48.935 --> 00:18:53.036]  You're going to have tax rebates for gouging your eyeballs out with hot pokers.
[00:18:55.748 --> 00:18:59.129]  And they just put it on the news with a straight face.
[00:18:59.129 --> 00:19:00.690]  Burn your eyes out with Drano.
[00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:01.370]  It's sexy.
[00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.391]  It's cool.
[00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:06.213]  These people are poor, sad folks, but this is who they really are.
[00:19:06.213 --> 00:19:08.334]  You need to accept it.
[00:19:08.334 --> 00:19:16.217]  But you also got a lot of a man come in the restroom with you because they feel like they're a woman.
[00:19:16.217 --> 00:19:20.639]  But a normal heterosexual relationship is oppressive of women and should be banned.
[00:19:22.791 --> 00:19:34.961]  It is the injection of mass mental illness with rudderless, mindless, dumbed down, domesticated people raised by liberals.
[00:19:34.961 --> 00:19:40.546]  Now these new people are just begging for death, begging for destruction.
[00:19:40.546 --> 00:19:46.171]  Their religion is hating themselves and getting a hold of your children.
[00:19:46.171 --> 00:19:50.835]  And it's just to lay the groundwork for us to fall like an old rotten dead tree in a high wind.
[00:19:51.969 --> 00:19:55.319]  Because the mass extermination of the general public comes after this.
[00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:56.983]  This is just the softening up phase.
[00:19:56.983 --> 00:19:58.046]  We'll break it down on the other side.
[00:19:59.602 --> 00:20:04.024]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[00:20:04.024 --> 00:20:08.086]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[00:20:08.086 --> 00:20:15.429]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s, and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[00:20:15.429 --> 00:20:20.691]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[00:20:20.691 --> 00:20:29.115]  If you want to boost your omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.

[00:21:31.245 --> 00:21:34.986]  The Electronic Frontier Foundation Privacy Report says it's AT&T.
[00:21:34.986 --> 00:21:39.847]  AT&T customers need to know this when calling the Alex Jones 24-7 listen line at 1-605-562-9000.
[00:21:39.847 --> 00:21:42.468]  Big Brother is listening.

[00:21:46.649 --> 00:21:50.989]  Call the Alex Jones 24-7 listen line on any phone, but please don't use AT&T.
[00:21:50.989 --> 00:21:53.690]  For everyone else, bookmark Alex Jones listen line number today.
[00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:53.990]  1-605-562-9000.
[00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.210]  That's 1-605-562-9000.
[00:21:59.071 --> 00:22:05.774]  My name is Bill Bonner and I'm the president of the largest private news and research network in the world.
[00:22:05.774 --> 00:22:11.257]  And I paid for this airtime because I have an important message to the American people.
[00:22:11.257 --> 00:22:15.799]  There's a change coming that the government isn't telling you about.
[00:22:15.799 --> 00:22:20.082]  This change has deep implications for life in America.
[00:22:20.082 --> 00:22:24.344]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:22:24.924 --> 00:22:28.045]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:22:28.045 --> 00:22:31.006]  Thing is, I was right then, too.
[00:22:31.006 --> 00:22:35.427]  A few years ago, I warned that housing prices would collapse.
[00:22:35.427 --> 00:22:36.507]  They did.
[00:22:36.507 --> 00:22:41.568]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[00:22:41.568 --> 00:22:42.729]  They did.
[00:22:42.729 --> 00:22:46.569]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:22:46.569 --> 00:22:48.950]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.450]  This will affect us all.
[00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:52.491]  You can watch the video for free right now
[00:22:52.811 --> 00:22:53.112]  We're good.
[00:22:58.869 --> 00:23:07.772]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[00:23:07.772 --> 00:23:08.852]  Silver Lungs.
[00:23:08.852 --> 00:23:16.155]  With the addition of our unique lung delivery system, respiratory infections are targeted directly, where traditional oral administration simply cannot reach.
[00:23:16.155 --> 00:23:22.197]  This pioneering method also preserves the original particle sizes and delivers your silver solution directly into the bloodstream.
[00:23:22.197 --> 00:23:26.318]  See the Silver Lungs generator and lung delivery system at SilverLungs.com.
[00:23:26.318 --> 00:23:28.039]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[00:23:28.439 --> 00:23:29.299]  We're good to go!
[00:24:06.008 --> 00:24:17.378]  We're playing this for Bancroft Television to analyze how mainstream media is mainlining the trans-abled movement to mutilate or maim yourself all at taxpayer expense.
[00:24:17.378 --> 00:24:18.839]  Here is part of the sickening report.
[00:24:22.717 --> 00:24:24.139]  B.I.I.D.
[00:24:24.139 --> 00:24:28.486]  means that you have a need to be disabled in some way.
[00:24:28.486 --> 00:24:32.031]  In my case, it was a need to go blind.
[00:24:32.031 --> 00:24:38.180]  Nine years ago, Jewel took the drastic decision to blind herself, and she researched the methods she would use.
[00:24:39.081 --> 00:24:44.563]  I found that lye is very painful, although it does get the job done.
[00:24:44.563 --> 00:24:51.805]  I found that drain cleaner is little less painful, although it does a lot of damage to the eye.
[00:24:51.805 --> 00:24:56.667]  Because drain cleaner was easily available to me, I went with that.
[00:24:56.667 --> 00:25:04.489]  She found a psychologist willing to help her, and after two weeks of working together to make sure she was ready, they carried out Jewel's plan.
[00:25:04.489 --> 00:25:07.530]  I laid down on the sofa, and he sat next to me.
[00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.792]  Two drops into each eye.
[00:25:10.792 --> 00:25:13.295]  My eyes were screaming.
[00:25:13.295 --> 00:25:18.619]  I had some drain cleaner going down my cheek, burning my skin.
[00:25:18.619 --> 00:25:24.004]  In the moment, all I could think of was, I'm going blind.
[00:25:24.004 --> 00:25:24.785]  It's going to be okay.
[00:25:25.615 --> 00:25:33.677]  After waiting half an hour to make sure the damage was done, the psychologist took Jewel to hospital where doctors fought to save her sight.
[00:25:33.677 --> 00:25:46.019]  When I woke up the following day, I was joyful until I turned on my back, opened my eyes and could see the TV screen.
[00:25:46.019 --> 00:25:50.300]  I was so enraged and I thought that it hadn't worked.
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:26:01.264]  Then, over about six months, the sight in both eyes slowly went away.
[00:26:01.264 --> 00:26:02.925]  I was so happy.
[00:26:02.925 --> 00:26:06.227]  I felt that this was who I was supposed to be.
[00:26:06.227 --> 00:26:06.927]  Okay, that's enough.
[00:26:08.936 --> 00:26:11.138]  And that's Barcroft Television out of the UK.
[00:26:11.138 --> 00:26:13.339]  It's worldwide.
[00:26:13.339 --> 00:26:19.304]  The full video is up on Infowars.com and a story pouring drain cleaner in your eyes.
[00:26:19.304 --> 00:26:21.826]  The new trendy social justice movement.
[00:26:21.826 --> 00:26:26.089]  Not supporting people who want to blind themselves is bigoted and intolerant.
[00:26:26.089 --> 00:26:32.854]  And having the name mother, father, boy or girl hurts people that don't have a mother or father or who aren't a boy or girl.
[00:26:32.854 --> 00:26:38.238]  So you can't use that word because you existing is hateful.
[00:26:40.376 --> 00:26:42.859]  And Europeans existing is wrong.
[00:26:42.859 --> 00:26:56.975]  They have major members of the UK and German and French government in the last month on television, we've ran the articles, saying it's good we've opened the borders up to the Middle East because it's bad that Europe has white people.
[00:26:56.975 --> 00:26:59.417]  And it's good they're all about to be gone.
[00:26:59.417 --> 00:27:01.500]  Well, I'm not against North Africans or Arabs.
[00:27:03.732 --> 00:27:08.557]  But a lot of them have picked up the chant, yeah, we're coming to breed you out, we're gonna conquer you, you're weak!
[00:27:08.557 --> 00:27:14.103]  Because the government says, come in, we're weak, take us over!
[00:27:14.103 --> 00:27:17.126]  And I talked to Paul Watson about this a few weeks ago, I said, what do you think it is?
[00:27:17.126 --> 00:27:19.889]  And he said, I think it's cuckolding.
[00:27:19.889 --> 00:27:26.616]  And I said, you mean where a woman basically like dominates her husband in front of another man and the man has sex with her?
[00:27:27.452 --> 00:27:29.835]  I don't mean to talk about this on air, folks, but this is psychology.
[00:27:29.835 --> 00:27:31.979]  And he goes, yes, exactly.
[00:27:31.979 --> 00:27:33.060]  And I said, you're absolutely right.
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.544]  That's what I think it is.
[00:27:35.544 --> 00:27:36.745]  And no one else was really saying this.
[00:27:36.745 --> 00:27:37.607]  We both understood.
[00:27:37.607 --> 00:27:40.771]  It's like a weird form of domination.
[00:27:40.771 --> 00:27:43.776]  It's sadomasochistic where they are the sadists.
[00:27:47.904 --> 00:27:55.567]  Just taking anything that was powerful, strong, and an original culture and destroying it.
[00:27:55.567 --> 00:27:57.668]  And they want to destroy the third world as well.
[00:27:57.668 --> 00:27:58.328]  They've done that.
[00:27:58.328 --> 00:28:01.469]  They try to keep the third world in squalor.
[00:28:01.469 --> 00:28:10.672]  And they are the masters of this planet and they want to normalize pouring drain cleaner in your eyes.
[00:28:10.672 --> 00:28:11.653]  And making us pay for it.
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:13.860]  Because they're evil.
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.060]  The globalists are sick.
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:33.944]  They have to normalize that, invert reality, and say those of us that want to go for a jog in the morning, that enjoy a beautiful sunset, that enjoy a loving relationship with somebody of the opposite sex, who want to raise good children, who just love decency and don't love degeneracy.
[00:28:33.944 --> 00:28:35.004]  We're the enemy.
[00:28:35.004 --> 00:28:37.945]  And look, I get being corrupt.
[00:28:37.945 --> 00:28:39.145]  I get doing bad things.
[00:28:40.495 --> 00:28:45.056]  Not to this extent, but I understand everybody's got another side to them.
[00:28:45.056 --> 00:28:52.937]  But you give in to that side, you'll end up alone, lonely, very low life expectancy, very poor.
[00:28:52.937 --> 00:28:56.958]  People that get into degeneracy are losers.
[00:28:56.958 --> 00:29:01.519]  And they want to make all the rest of us losers because losers love company.
[00:29:01.519 --> 00:29:05.459]  This woman is fabulously mentally ill.
[00:29:05.459 --> 00:29:07.840]  Fabulously a self-hater.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.260]  Fabulously wants attention.
[00:29:11.357 --> 00:29:14.484]  And she wants to make you pay for it.
[00:29:14.484 --> 00:29:21.158]  And then she found another twisted individual who wanted to come be part of this and do this to her.
[00:29:25.086 --> 00:29:34.315]  And it's an act of dominating reality that they can do something obscene, like take someone's sight when so many millions of people that are blind would give anything for it.
[00:29:34.315 --> 00:29:38.559]  They take a gift like that and create vandalism on God's creation.
[00:29:38.559 --> 00:29:43.183]  That woman sacrificed her eyes because she's demon possessed.
[00:29:43.183 --> 00:29:48.869]  Whether it's a demon, whether it's an archetype, whatever it is, the woman is infested.
[00:29:50.103 --> 00:29:52.624]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:59.568]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.568 --> 00:30:01.609]  Kit Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[00:30:01.609 --> 00:30:05.431]  President Obama implied that the federal government should confiscate all guns.
[00:30:05.431 --> 00:30:06.171]  That's right.
[00:30:06.171 --> 00:30:11.374]  The president responsible for the deaths of women and children via drone strikes is now trying to eradicate the Second Amendment.
[00:30:11.374 --> 00:30:15.096]  When Obama responded to the October 1st attack on an Oregon community college,
[00:30:15.376 --> 00:30:22.279]  He went beyond his usual demand for more gun control and suggested that America should consider outright banning guns just like Australia and Great Britain.
[00:30:22.279 --> 00:30:30.923]  But it's hypocritical for Obama to demand that Americans turn in their guns when, according to the Pentagon, the Obama administration is backing ISIS in its war against the Syrian government.
[00:30:30.923 --> 00:30:36.485]  In fact, in September 2013, President Obama waived a federal law specifically designed to keep the U.S.
[00:30:36.485 --> 00:30:39.647]  government from supplying firearms to terrorist groups such as ISIS.
[00:30:39.647 --> 00:30:43.349]  On the very same day, he demanded more gun control in response to the D.C.
[00:30:43.349 --> 00:30:44.109]  Navy Yard shooting.
[00:30:44.429 --> 00:30:51.918]  In other words, Obama is shipping guns to Islamic militants, aka moderate rebels, while simultaneously trying to disarm American citizens.
[00:30:51.918 --> 00:30:58.886]  Once again, this is Kent Daniels with TheInfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and check out our new YouTube channel called Resistance News.
[00:30:59.386 --> 00:31:03.690]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:07.953]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[00:31:07.953 --> 00:31:15.239]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[00:31:15.399 --> 00:31:26.068]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[00:31:26.068 --> 00:31:29.591]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[00:31:29.591 --> 00:31:30.732]  What do you have to lose?
[00:31:30.732 --> 00:31:33.014]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty.
[00:31:33.314 --> 00:31:39.157]  And you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[00:31:39.157 --> 00:31:42.459]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[00:31:42.459 --> 00:31:46.662]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[00:31:46.662 --> 00:31:48.963]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[00:31:48.963 --> 00:31:55.927]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:31:59.369 --> 00:32:09.471]  Most of the InfoWars radio listening audience is aware of the high-quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at HDFirearms.com.

[00:32:52.067 --> 00:32:55.749]  Aborted babies incinerated to eat in UK hospitals.
[00:33:11.684 --> 00:33:15.847]  Soylent Green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[00:33:15.847 --> 00:33:22.111]  But now, children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[00:33:22.111 --> 00:33:27.455]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[00:33:27.455 --> 00:33:32.098]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[00:33:32.098 --> 00:33:34.639]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[00:33:34.639 --> 00:33:37.281]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[00:33:37.281 --> 00:33:41.284]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soylent Green is in short supply.
[00:33:42.105 --> 00:33:45.109]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
[00:33:45.109 --> 00:33:48.694]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted.
[00:33:48.694 --> 00:33:50.296]  You must evacuate the area.
[00:33:52.947 --> 00:34:05.470]  The federal court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Bilderberg Group Company, are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring, but we already know.
[00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:07.450]  So enjoy the flavor!
[00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:12.091]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes.
[00:34:12.091 --> 00:34:14.072]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[00:34:14.072 --> 00:34:15.952]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[00:34:15.952 --> 00:34:17.253]  I'm for regular suicide.
[00:34:17.253 --> 00:34:18.853]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[00:34:19.153 --> 00:34:30.501]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[00:34:30.501 --> 00:34:34.884]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[00:34:34.884 --> 00:34:41.148]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[00:34:49.366 --> 00:34:51.987]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[00:34:51.987 --> 00:34:56.890]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[00:34:56.890 --> 00:34:59.391]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[00:34:59.391 --> 00:35:08.736]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[00:35:08.736 --> 00:35:11.237]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[00:35:11.877 --> 00:35:14.078]  The scoops are on their way.
[00:35:14.078 --> 00:35:16.459]  The scoops are on their way.
[00:35:16.459 --> 00:35:19.800]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.081]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[00:35:23.081 --> 00:35:26.182]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[00:35:26.182 --> 00:35:28.263]  We've got to stop them!
[00:35:28.263 --> 00:35:28.783]  Somehow!
[00:35:28.783 --> 00:35:33.265]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[00:35:33.265 --> 00:35:35.086]  Soylent Green is people!
[00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:52.194]  Made in the 1970s, now Pepsi does use babies in their secret flavoring.
[00:35:52.194 --> 00:36:03.483]  We talked about that five years ago, people didn't believe us, it became mainstream news, and now we know they're selling baby parts en masse, and that 87% of Planned Parenthood's profits are not from even government funding.
[00:36:05.256 --> 00:36:28.705]  hundreds of millions a year or from the women paying for abortions because they charge women less than the abortions actually cost to incentivize the women coming in so they don't know the secret that they're making thousands of dollars per abortion even on the small fetuses and in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars on an eight-month fully formed baby.
[00:36:30.865 --> 00:36:35.869]  And now it's come out over the weekend in China, what we already knew, but it's mainstream news.
[00:36:35.869 --> 00:36:51.281]  It's on Infowars.com from Reuters and other publications that China is keeping Falun Gong prisoners alive and is harvesting organs and then basically keeping them in comas to come back and get the other organs.
[00:36:54.206 --> 00:37:03.192]  And that they're also keeping people alive on the tarmac while they harvest them, then killing them, and then flying the organs into Japan for delivery.
[00:37:03.192 --> 00:37:07.035]  I was told this by Falun Gong insiders on the show more than a decade ago.
[00:37:07.035 --> 00:37:08.736]  It's now mainstream news.
[00:37:08.736 --> 00:37:13.399]  Presidents in China had their livers, kidneys, and corneas ripped while alive.
[00:37:13.399 --> 00:37:18.243]  The Daily Mail is just one of the publications.
[00:37:18.243 --> 00:37:19.884]  I said I'd give you the key.
[00:37:19.884 --> 00:37:21.805]  The key has already been placed right in front of you.
[00:37:21.805 --> 00:37:22.766]  I'm sure most of you see it.
[00:37:24.189 --> 00:37:28.452]  They're getting ready to unleash hell.
[00:37:28.452 --> 00:37:34.056]  The UK government announced two months ago they would not tolerate free speech anymore.
[00:37:34.056 --> 00:37:36.438]  Of conservatives.
[00:37:36.438 --> 00:37:45.525]  The UK government announced today, 10 Downing Street, that civil rights and human rights is no longer their priority.
[00:37:45.525 --> 00:37:47.606]  That they are going to totalitarianism.
[00:37:47.606 --> 00:37:50.509]  These are naked, brazen announcements.
[00:37:51.425 --> 00:37:59.127]  Germany has reactivated the Stasi and is taking children from people that criticize the socialist government in any way.
[00:37:59.127 --> 00:38:11.792]  America has now established, with the UN Directorate, mainstream news, a global police force to fight extremism.
[00:38:11.792 --> 00:38:19.234]  CNN takes a mixed-race, socialist, anti-Christian devil worshiper, who hated Christians and wanted to kill them,
[00:38:20.683 --> 00:38:40.353]  And probably committed the mass shooting to demonize the Second Amendment, we're seeing more and more of that, as a false flag, himself, not directed, but himself, carrying it out as an agent of evil, and they turn him sheet white like a ghost, and say he was a white supremacist in the LA Times and CNN, and even made his nose more caucasoid.
[00:38:40.353 --> 00:38:44.535]  Oh, I'm sorry, that's a scientific word, I'm racist.
[00:38:44.535 --> 00:38:45.235]  Caucasian.
[00:38:49.212 --> 00:38:51.554]  They don't play games, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:51.554 --> 00:38:55.897]  They made his lips smaller, his nose smaller, and turned him deathly white.
[00:38:55.897 --> 00:39:00.901]  Only people I ever saw that white were corpses.
[00:39:00.901 --> 00:39:07.166]  Turned the poor fella into a walking dead, so they could continue their race division.
[00:39:07.166 --> 00:39:13.130]  Because the truth is, there's black crazies, there's white crazies, there's Hispanic crazies, there's Asian crazies.
[00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:16.593]  There's bad people out there, and that's why we have guns, to protect ourselves from them.
[00:39:17.742 --> 00:39:26.568]  Then boy, don't they wish he was white, so they'd feed into their whole narrative to try to stir up a bigger race war in this country, or the globalist wage war against us all.
[00:39:26.568 --> 00:39:29.010]  So that's the final equation.
[00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:31.372]  They need to normalize pouring Drano in your eyes.
[00:39:31.372 --> 00:39:41.719]  They need to have scores of shows about the world after humans and how bad people are, and teach us to hate ourselves, and teach us to hate our life force, and teach us to believe we're losers and failures.
[00:39:43.513 --> 00:39:46.054]  So society and civilization collapses.
[00:39:46.054 --> 00:39:49.735]  They've taken out the family for all intents and purposes.
[00:39:49.735 --> 00:39:52.876]  Now they're trying to take out the man and woman relationship.
[00:39:52.876 --> 00:39:58.477]  They're trying to build in all the taxes so that it's not easily done.
[00:39:58.477 --> 00:40:06.279]  So that everybody's alone, everybody's stupid, no one has any culture, every culture's evil, every culture's bad.
[00:40:06.279 --> 00:40:12.621]  Anything that pre-existed before the New World Order must be erased, disappeared, culturally
[00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:15.630]  Purged.
[00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.871]  Genocided.
[00:40:17.871 --> 00:40:28.554]  And in its place, Leather Daddy conferences with men marching slaves on chains down the street in Chicago with their eyes sewn shut.
[00:40:28.554 --> 00:40:33.815]  I remember Buckley moved to Chicago like 11 years ago and lived in a high-rise next door to a major hotel.
[00:40:33.815 --> 00:40:36.296]  He walked in one morning to get brunch there and there was a
[00:40:38.253 --> 00:40:49.824]  quote gay conference and there were people just like in leather everywhere and slaves and men on chains with their eyes shown shut like something out of Hellraiser.
[00:40:49.824 --> 00:40:54.068]  Then I learned about movements in Austin where folks had their arms and legs cut off and I saw it.
[00:40:54.068 --> 00:41:01.275]  Then I learned the people that would go in and like to be shot by guns because they're like the bullet hole scars and I told people about it and people didn't even believe me.
[00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:11.774]  This is all government globalists psychiatrically funded and pushed to bring down civilization.
[00:41:11.774 --> 00:41:23.859]  And then they call it liberal and they giggle and laugh at you like insane cult members when you tell them they're being taught to hate themselves.
[00:41:23.859 --> 00:41:26.040]  As they induct people into these lifestyles.
[00:41:28.137 --> 00:41:29.518]  I mean, can you, quote, be gay?
[00:41:29.518 --> 00:41:32.059]  Oh, let me use the term they ordered me to use.
[00:41:32.059 --> 00:41:41.504]  No, can you be homosexual and end up dying at 85 years old, married to someone you love of the same sex, and have a good life and a good culture?
[00:41:41.504 --> 00:41:42.764]  Yes, very rarely.
[00:41:42.764 --> 00:41:43.885]  There are cases of it.
[00:41:43.885 --> 00:41:53.390]  But if you look statistically, the suicide, the abuse, the drugs, the degeneracy, the mutilation is off the chart.
[00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:55.391]  It's the most unhappy group of people in the world.
[00:41:56.872 --> 00:42:03.316]  Then they sell the idea that, well, that's because you hurt us and were mean to us and didn't embrace us.
[00:42:03.316 --> 00:42:09.700]  Really, there have been cultures where it's been fully embraced by the government and they promptly collapse.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:23.089]  This has been done to cause the collapse of civilization because the globalists are developing high-tech reservations that are exempt from the taxes, from the cultural degradation, that are separate.
[00:42:23.089 --> 00:42:24.370]  You don't get into the globalist
[00:42:25.748 --> 00:42:37.652]  Proto-Elysium bases that are on the ground and that are on artificial islands and being established, you don't get on to those things when you buy into any of this stuff.
[00:42:37.652 --> 00:42:42.994]  That is a cultural poison put out there to neutralize society.
[00:42:42.994 --> 00:42:54.478]  Do you think the very same government in the 60s that introduced homosexuality to the schools and the culture and the movies and the literature, the little front men like Gore Vidal, who meant well, do you think
[00:42:57.128 --> 00:43:10.134]  Those same people really cared about you when they were putting HIV and hepatitis shots at clinics in New York and San Francisco to give gay men HIV, the first weaponized true strain.
[00:43:10.134 --> 00:43:15.017]  HIV is just a whole cover for a whole bunch of different strains they've developed.
[00:43:15.017 --> 00:43:19.479]  And it attacks people that already have run-down immune systems.
[00:43:19.479 --> 00:43:22.060]  And it's racially based.
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:23.741]  But because Caucasians
[00:43:25.464 --> 00:43:29.546]  are so closely aligned to Africans genetically, you still get crossover.
[00:43:29.546 --> 00:43:31.847]  It could still kill white people.
[00:43:31.847 --> 00:43:34.688]  But you've noticed how many black folks have it.
[00:43:34.688 --> 00:43:41.270]  You could sneeze if you've got HIV and you give a black person it, not if you're white.
[00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:46.432]  So, let's talk about reality here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:46.432 --> 00:43:47.633]  Let's talk about what's being done.
[00:43:50.404 --> 00:43:55.166]  They are just testing wholesale rollouts of nightmares all over Latin America.
[00:43:55.166 --> 00:44:13.851]  They don't get their IMF and World Bank money unless they give between 10 and 13-year-old girls the Gardasil shot on record that attacks the ovaries, on record attacks their entire reproductive system.
[00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:15.832]  Wow, you guys actually found an article.
[00:44:15.832 --> 00:44:18.773]  Scroll back down on that to the top.
[00:44:20.046 --> 00:44:20.806]  That's U.S.
[00:44:20.806 --> 00:44:21.747]  News Health Report.
[00:44:21.747 --> 00:44:22.347]  I didn't know that.
[00:44:22.347 --> 00:44:23.228]  Print that for me.
[00:44:23.228 --> 00:44:46.142]  I remember my dad, in like 1987, explaining to me that HIV was a government bioweapons program targeting blacks, and that whites don't have the receptor sites on the T-lymphocytes to accept the virus, but it could still get in, that there's enough of a flood of it, and that it was a very sad program to wipe out minorities.
[00:44:48.683 --> 00:44:51.184]  And I asked him how he knew, and he just said, I know people.
[00:44:51.184 --> 00:44:53.965]  I ought to bring him in here and interrogate him.
[00:44:53.965 --> 00:44:55.986]  Thing is, he'll never tell me anything.
[00:44:55.986 --> 00:45:00.247]  And, he said, oh, literature, literature, last time I asked him.
[00:45:00.247 --> 00:45:04.269]  But, there it is, right there, in U.S.
[00:45:04.269 --> 00:45:08.730]  News and World Report.
[00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:10.791]  Genetic trait boost AIDS risk in blacks.
[00:45:10.791 --> 00:45:12.011]  Wow, I didn't even know they admitted that.
[00:45:16.246 --> 00:45:16.406]  In 2008?
[00:45:16.406 --> 00:45:16.686]  Wow.
[00:45:16.686 --> 00:45:20.787]  Okay, let me go back to the Gardasil real quick.
[00:45:20.787 --> 00:45:24.248]  Gardasil, when they did the trials, killed a bunch of people in the U.S.
[00:45:24.248 --> 00:45:25.569]  Japan has banned it.
[00:45:25.569 --> 00:45:30.950]  India won't let you give it to kids.
[00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:34.992]  And they go, and they give the little girls this, and people say, well, Alex, you're against open borders.
[00:45:34.992 --> 00:45:36.532]  You're against all these illegals.
[00:45:36.532 --> 00:45:37.792]  Why don't you let the U.N.
[00:45:37.792 --> 00:45:38.813]  This is what liberals say.
[00:45:38.813 --> 00:45:40.013]  Why don't you let the U.N.
[00:45:40.013 --> 00:45:41.694]  go ahead and take these people out?
[00:45:41.694 --> 00:45:43.814]  I don't hate Mexicans.
[00:45:43.814 --> 00:45:45.735]  I don't want them brought up here, put on socialism.
[00:45:47.102 --> 00:45:58.009]  And turn into globalist bots and then vote to take my guns and bring in the socialist revolution so I'm dependent, so I can have healthcare and medical decisions dictated to me, part of the eugenics program.
[00:45:58.009 --> 00:46:04.553]  But I don't want to kill the reproductive production of Mexican women.
[00:46:04.553 --> 00:46:05.954]  It's so one-dimensional.
[00:46:05.954 --> 00:46:14.339]  People have to understand, folks, when you're hanging around with an NAACP leader in most cities, or you're hanging around with a liberal, they're not liberals, folks.
[00:46:16.613 --> 00:46:24.896]  When you're hanging around with a high-powered Democrat, you're basically hanging around, in most cases, with a group above the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:46:24.896 --> 00:46:31.598]  The Ku Klux Klan is in their dialectic, the dumb group that they use to just create war against white people.
[00:46:31.598 --> 00:46:35.059]  And to make any type of Anglo rights or culture look bad.
[00:46:35.059 --> 00:46:35.960]  Because they don't like that either.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.200]  They don't want any culture the globals don't control.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:39.961]  Anything strong.
[00:46:39.961 --> 00:46:44.522]  But they really don't like black people.
[00:46:44.522 --> 00:46:45.863]  The globalists really hate them.
[00:46:46.636 --> 00:46:51.240]  And that's why they got the blacks right underneath their wing, right there going, I'm going to give you free stuff.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.482]  I'm going to pay your women not to have men in the house.
[00:46:53.482 --> 00:46:56.585]  And I'm going to put gangster rap out there to make your men think it's cool.
[00:46:56.585 --> 00:46:57.726]  So they dress and act like it.
[00:46:57.726 --> 00:47:00.168]  The police are primed and trained to put you in prison.
[00:47:00.168 --> 00:47:03.631]  Then we're going to train your leaders to say, kill the cops, so that you'll kill the cops.
[00:47:03.631 --> 00:47:05.112]  So the cops will even attack you more.
[00:47:05.112 --> 00:47:06.694]  So we can put all of you in prison.
[00:47:06.694 --> 00:47:07.535]  Now you go ahead.
[00:47:07.535 --> 00:47:12.519]  I'm your daddy, Al Sharpton, with the Rockefeller Foundation, hand up my puppet.
[00:47:13.539 --> 00:47:16.209]  And you just do what I said.
[00:47:16.209 --> 00:47:17.734]  Now you go right out there and play in traffic.
[00:47:23.803 --> 00:47:30.047]  I mean, you're not going to make it to the next level of development, ladies and gentlemen, unless you love everybody.
[00:47:30.047 --> 00:47:33.129]  And that means every race, every color, every creed.
[00:47:33.129 --> 00:47:34.470]  And you love their humanity.
[00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:43.496]  But then they take those of us that have love in our hearts and they manipulate it and say, good, accept everything, accept Drano in the eyes, pay for sex changes, pay for abortions.
[00:47:43.496 --> 00:47:47.539]  Let us have your kids and tell them how to be sexually active when they're seven years old.
[00:47:47.539 --> 00:47:48.760]  Do what we say.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.920]  Submit to us.
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:53.643]  Show us how moral and good you are and how open you are and how tolerant you are.
[00:47:54.644 --> 00:47:59.808]  So that we tolerate cultural death.
[00:47:59.808 --> 00:48:05.913]  And you notice now they're saying Facebook has 50 different sexual preferences, you can say you are, including no sex.
[00:48:05.913 --> 00:48:12.438]  And in the future you will be asexual, unsexual, drone creatures under the UN plan.
[00:48:12.438 --> 00:48:17.342]  This is all admitted by Julian Huxley, the father of transhumanism.
[00:48:17.342 --> 00:48:19.243]  They don't want you having passion.
[00:48:19.243 --> 00:48:21.866]  You know how much they hate seeing men and women together loving each other?
[00:48:22.816 --> 00:48:28.858]  You know how much they hate the incredible office of a man and woman really loving each other and coming together?
[00:48:28.858 --> 00:48:31.459]  That is so powerful.
[00:48:31.459 --> 00:48:35.420]  I mean, I used to read stuff when I was like 22 on this and I'd go, this only didn't that bad.
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.601]  They want people to be sexually active and get women out there.
[00:48:37.601 --> 00:48:44.403]  I kind of liked that because I was young and wild, you know, stupid and thought I knew everything.
[00:48:44.403 --> 00:48:48.625]  Now I understand because then you don't learn how to make that incredible bond with the right woman.
[00:48:49.821 --> 00:48:58.807]  That's made by pheromones and courting and other things that last a lifetime and will shepherd children and build a powerful house.
[00:48:58.807 --> 00:49:03.990]  So, they went in and they said, birth control, be sexually promiscuous, have fun, it's great, blah, blah, blah.
[00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:09.013]  And yeah, it's fun in the first level of it, until you get the second level, the third level, the fourth level.
[00:49:09.013 --> 00:49:15.818]  Because let's not just sit here and criticize sexually active gay people, let's talk about what heterosexuals do.
[00:49:15.818 --> 00:49:18.219]  Let's talk about how destructive that is.
[00:49:18.219 --> 00:49:18.840]  Long term.
[00:49:19.778 --> 00:49:23.881]  And believe me, I'm not up here on some high horse, folks.
[00:49:23.881 --> 00:49:31.085]  You know, I'm no Errol Flynn, but let me tell you, I've never had a problem with the ladies.
[00:49:31.085 --> 00:49:32.506]  I have just been through it.
[00:49:32.506 --> 00:49:35.608]  I can tell you, it's not fulfilling.
[00:49:35.608 --> 00:49:36.489]  Down the road.
[00:49:36.489 --> 00:49:37.269]  Long term.
[00:49:37.269 --> 00:49:38.850]  A real relationship is.
[00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:43.973]  Monogamous.
[00:49:43.973 --> 00:49:47.035]  And so they scientifically sabotaged our strength.
[00:49:47.035 --> 00:49:48.136]  They scientifically
[00:49:49.867 --> 00:49:50.647]  are bringing us down.
[00:49:50.647 --> 00:49:56.630]  This is the scientific fall of humanity and it's going to get crazier and wilder because evils try to take over over and over again.
[00:49:56.630 --> 00:50:04.754]  It's failed time and time again and so it's throwing everything it can in a scorched earth policy to reduce all culture.
[00:50:04.754 --> 00:50:16.819]  And they're going to ride the collapse of civilization down and out of the wreckage of that the globalists will emerge, the only ones with advanced technology and will be the new gods of this planet.
[00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:25.773]  And they even intend to keep villages of us around and old rotting cities of people and different sectors like the Hunger Games.
[00:50:25.773 --> 00:50:27.554]  People kept saying, you sound like the Hunger Games.
[00:50:27.554 --> 00:50:29.435]  No, I was saying that 20 years ago.
[00:50:29.435 --> 00:50:34.817]  The Hunger Games is just an adaptation of what the globalists really want to do.
[00:50:34.817 --> 00:50:36.118]  And that's it.
[00:50:36.118 --> 00:50:38.659]  That's their plan.
[00:50:38.659 --> 00:50:40.540]  By the way, they're going to keep some of us around.
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:43.601]  Maybe 100 million is the standard number in their documents.
[00:50:43.601 --> 00:50:47.603]  They're going to kill seven plus billion people in the collapse.
[00:50:48.618 --> 00:50:54.480]  And I don't know when the big collapse is coming, because there are many collapses before that getting us ready, but this is their plan.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.120]  You've been warned!
[00:51:14.551 --> 00:51:18.513]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[00:51:18.513 --> 00:51:21.595]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[00:51:21.595 --> 00:51:23.156]  Does that sound right to you?

[00:54:02.893 --> 00:54:06.515]  You did a bad, bad thing, New World Order.
[00:54:06.515 --> 00:54:09.496]  That's what Putin said when he was in the UN.
[00:54:09.496 --> 00:54:11.176]  He goes, look at what you've done.
[00:54:11.176 --> 00:54:17.019]  He's stabilizing the whole region, killing hundreds of thousands, putting extremists in charge.
[00:54:17.019 --> 00:54:17.799]  You did this.
[00:54:17.799 --> 00:54:18.980]  Look what you've done.
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:23.641]  They did a bad, bad thing.
[00:54:23.641 --> 00:54:27.003]  All the human chimeras, all the baby harvesting.
[00:54:31.449 --> 00:54:37.371]  Well then they tell you all day how to be politically correct and how to talk and what to do or they're gonna call you bad names.
[00:54:37.371 --> 00:54:43.232]  Oh they're setting up a national international group for extremists to arrest folks for their speech with the UN.
[00:54:43.232 --> 00:54:51.975]  Oh and they're setting up all these homeland security divisions over the rural communities to watch the farmers and to stop those farmers markets.
[00:54:54.878 --> 00:54:56.659]  These are true occupiers.
[00:54:56.659 --> 00:54:59.441]  We are actually occupied right now.
[00:54:59.441 --> 00:55:01.963]  But we're fighting back, trying to get a good Speaker of the House.
[00:55:01.963 --> 00:55:04.464]  We're trying to indict these folks.
[00:55:04.464 --> 00:55:05.965]  But they mean business.
[00:55:05.965 --> 00:55:07.086]  By the way, the Congressman just called.
[00:55:07.086 --> 00:55:09.328]  He's going to have to come on tomorrow because they moved some votes.
[00:55:09.328 --> 00:55:13.671]  So we're going to get that Congressman on about the whole Boehner situation tomorrow.
[00:55:13.671 --> 00:55:18.094]  Maybe later, but I'm just going to say tomorrow because we're talking about the third hour.
[00:55:18.094 --> 00:55:23.977]  Coming up, I want to get into Obama administration and UN announced global police force to fight extremists in the U.S.
[00:55:25.287 --> 00:55:26.728]  That's Breitbart.
[00:55:26.728 --> 00:55:30.209]  Delta Force considered staging fake hijacking after 9-11.
[00:55:30.209 --> 00:55:34.091]  Deal reached on the TPP.
[00:55:34.091 --> 00:55:36.112]  I've mentioned these but I'm going to be getting into them.
[00:55:36.112 --> 00:55:43.615]  Lesbian Swedish Bishop says make churches take down crosses, let Muslims move into them because crosses are hurtful.
[00:55:43.615 --> 00:55:44.435]  That's mainstream news.
[00:55:44.435 --> 00:55:45.296]  We're going to be getting into that.
[00:55:47.093 --> 00:55:47.494]  That's right.
[00:55:47.494 --> 00:55:48.836]  They're coming.
[00:55:48.836 --> 00:55:51.039]  They're not playing games here.
[00:55:51.039 --> 00:55:53.543]  So that's just some of what is coming up.
[00:55:53.543 --> 00:55:58.330]  Saudi Arabia mulls the launch of a regional war as Russia pounds targets in Syria.
[00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:01.895]  Now for the sixth day.
[00:56:01.895 --> 00:56:02.656]  That's all coming up.
[00:56:03.809 --> 00:56:06.230]  And of course, we're going to open the phones up in the next hour.
[00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:12.311]  Here's the toll-free number to join us on the mass shooting, on them doctoring the photo to make it a white guy.
[00:56:12.311 --> 00:56:16.432]  I mean, there's no end to the deception because they've taken the plunge.
[00:56:16.432 --> 00:56:18.193]  They're going for broke.
[00:56:18.193 --> 00:56:19.253]  We've got to go for broke.
[00:56:19.253 --> 00:56:19.293]  800-259-9231.
[00:56:24.690 --> 00:56:32.212]  You know, I found out one of the biggest reasons we're under such government scrutiny right now is because of whistleblowers, documents, things like that.
[00:56:32.212 --> 00:56:41.015]  I've gotten to the point where I can't even respond to whistleblowers anymore because of the fact that I've basically been told that's the issue.
[00:56:41.015 --> 00:56:47.017]  And it's not that I'm afraid to do it, it's that they will arrest me.
[00:56:47.017 --> 00:56:49.398]  And plus, we already know.
[00:56:49.398 --> 00:56:53.299]  They're so mad about Tosh Plumley, folks, and Benghazi and all that, and Colonel Schaefer,
[00:56:54.853 --> 00:56:57.255]  It's like, okay, what, more whistleblowers proving it?
[00:56:57.255 --> 00:56:59.136]  I don't even want to know, okay?
[00:56:59.136 --> 00:57:01.858]  They carried it out, it was staged, there you go.
[00:57:01.858 --> 00:57:04.980]  I mean, at a certain point, how do you beat a dead horse anymore?
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:08.822]  It's just, I don't even have time to cover all the leads and all the proof.
[00:57:08.822 --> 00:57:13.025]  It's just, the government runs secret baby harvesting operations.
[00:57:13.025 --> 00:57:16.747]  Pepsi puts baby flavoring in, I mean, you know.
[00:57:16.747 --> 00:57:17.788]  They're evil, people!
[00:57:20.185 --> 00:57:21.646]  And they're going for broke.
[00:57:21.646 --> 00:57:23.547]  They take down humanity.
[00:57:23.547 --> 00:57:25.409]  The elite will control the whole future.
[00:57:25.409 --> 00:57:27.390]  That's why they're so brutal.
[00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:29.792]  They're not backing down.
[00:57:29.792 --> 00:57:42.841]  Whether you're FBI, or CIA, or NSA, or a banker, or a politician, or an arrogant NFL football player, do you get you're basically living in the beginning of a false reality as the breakaway civilization expands away from us?
[00:57:42.841 --> 00:57:48.906]  And as we're dumbed down and slow-poisoned to see if we respond, to see if we notice, as they titrate the dose?
[00:57:50.779 --> 00:57:52.860]  Prostagard is what is it?
[00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:57.462]  10 different compounds all known for good prostate function and health.
[00:57:57.462 --> 00:57:59.683]  Saw Palmetto is just look it up for yourself.

[00:58:11.642 --> 00:58:18.624]  Vitamin D3, selenium, copper, plant sterols, lycopene, that's the real key, and salt palmetto, a healthy dose of all those.

[00:58:49.423 --> 00:58:50.684]  Another major health threat.
[00:58:50.684 --> 00:58:55.666]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:58:55.666 --> 00:58:58.347]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:58:58.347 --> 00:59:05.390]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:08.371]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:59:08.371 --> 00:59:11.332]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:59:11.332 --> 00:59:13.353]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:59:13.353 --> 00:59:16.134]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:59:16.254 --> 00:59:21.995]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:59:21.995 --> 00:59:25.496]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:59:25.496 --> 00:59:28.597]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:59:28.597 --> 00:59:35.918]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[01:00:05.478 --> 01:00:10.322]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.322 --> 01:00:11.903]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.903 --> 01:00:13.444]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.444 --> 01:00:17.647]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:22.451]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.451 --> 01:00:28.075]  Alright, here's what's going to be going down in this third hour, or the second hour, and third hour.
[01:00:28.075 --> 01:00:30.436]  Wide open telephones.
[01:00:30.436 --> 01:00:33.519]  Now, if some stations just joined us recapping
[01:00:35.655 --> 01:00:39.859]  Pouring drain cleaner in your eyes, the next new trendy social justice movement.
[01:00:39.859 --> 01:00:43.542]  And if you even have sight, it's hurtful to folks that don't have sight.
[01:00:43.542 --> 01:00:47.166]  So I guess the trendy thing to do is burn your eyeballs out.
[01:00:47.166 --> 01:00:48.928]  I'm not joking.
[01:00:48.928 --> 01:00:49.868]  That's Transable.
[01:00:49.868 --> 01:00:50.949]  We've been telling you about the movement.
[01:00:50.949 --> 01:00:54.453]  It's now being pushed as the trendiest, coolest thing since sliced bread.
[01:00:56.275 --> 01:01:03.958]  Also, deal reached on the TPP, some really bad news, and the text of it is still pretty much secret.
[01:01:03.958 --> 01:01:06.439]  A few sections have been leaked.
[01:01:06.439 --> 01:01:12.801]  Also, Delta Force considering staging fake hijacking after 9-11.
[01:01:12.801 --> 01:01:14.482]  Also, Obama administration and U.N.
[01:01:14.482 --> 01:01:19.304]  announced global police force to fight extremism in the U.S.
[01:01:19.304 --> 01:01:21.745]  I actually have the transcript of the agreement.
[01:01:23.097 --> 01:01:27.318]  Because they never show you the agreement, they just announce that they can do whatever they want.
[01:01:27.318 --> 01:01:28.918]  We're just shutting power plants down.
[01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:31.359]  Congress passed a law we couldn't, we're doing it.
[01:01:31.359 --> 01:01:33.500]  We're just coming out with your guns, there's no law, we're just doing it.
[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:39.041]  We're going to put transgender bathrooms in the first grade school.
[01:01:39.041 --> 01:01:41.121]  We're going to teach your kids about it.
[01:01:41.121 --> 01:01:45.022]  Because we want to.
[01:01:45.022 --> 01:01:47.063]  And then coming up, we're going to get U.S.
[01:01:49.651 --> 01:01:52.652]  UCSD says term minorities is now offensive.
[01:01:52.652 --> 01:01:54.672]  See, everything's offensive.
[01:01:54.672 --> 01:01:55.793]  Everything's bad.
[01:01:55.793 --> 01:02:02.654]  James Woods comes out and says hate crime massacre of Christians finally silences Obama.
[01:02:02.654 --> 01:02:03.395]  Except it hasn't.
[01:02:03.395 --> 01:02:09.716]  Obama's still running around blaming individual gun owners for what some psychopath did with guns he got illegally.
[01:02:09.716 --> 01:02:15.418]  By the way, Google's parent company is dropping the don't be evil motto.
[01:02:15.418 --> 01:02:16.358]  Oh, that's really funny.
[01:02:18.684 --> 01:02:24.246]  UK admits human rights no longer a priority of British foreign policy, and they've announced domestically as well.
[01:02:24.246 --> 01:02:30.388]  That is just some of what's coming up, but don't worry about the secret trade deal.
[01:02:30.388 --> 01:02:35.850]  Even if it was a great deal, we shouldn't be for, because it's secret.
[01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:38.231]  We should have Congress see it, we should know what's in it.
[01:02:38.231 --> 01:02:41.392]  Of course, it's totally horrible, just the sections we've got and so over the top.
[01:02:41.392 --> 01:02:42.613]  It's world government.
[01:02:42.613 --> 01:02:45.314]  And they finally will then all vote and agree to it all,
[01:02:46.414 --> 01:02:54.321]  And the overarching world tax program defunded in Paris in December with this new global government treaty.
[01:02:54.321 --> 01:02:55.642]  And it's called global government.
[01:02:55.642 --> 01:02:57.443]  The Pope calls it global government.
[01:02:57.443 --> 01:03:03.308]  And then they got the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL wrote new articles the last few weeks saying I'm completely insane.
[01:03:03.308 --> 01:03:07.291]  There is no such thing as a world government, a carbon tax.
[01:03:07.291 --> 01:03:07.872]  There's nothing!
[01:03:07.872 --> 01:03:13.877]  I remember the State Department a few years ago came out and said China doesn't harvest organs.
[01:03:14.815 --> 01:03:17.698]  China advertises they harvest political dissidents organs.
[01:03:17.698 --> 01:03:20.961]  You see the level of brainwashing we're dealing with here?
[01:03:20.961 --> 01:03:21.961]  It's like Hillary.
[01:03:21.961 --> 01:03:23.503]  Let's go out to break with this.
[01:03:23.503 --> 01:03:25.385]  You can scramble and find that clip.
[01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:32.791]  Hillary dodges on email question, claims to be the most transparent person in American history.
[01:03:32.791 --> 01:03:37.355]  I mean, Hillary has become one of the most unintentionally funny people in America.
[01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:38.696]  Here she is on Comedy Central.
[01:03:38.696 --> 01:03:39.898]  Of course, she wasn't on Comedy Central.
[01:03:39.898 --> 01:03:40.198]  Here it is.
[01:03:40.925 --> 01:03:43.987]  Do you get how bad it looks?
[01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:57.213]  It looks like you set up a personal server, you set up your own email, so that you would have control of those emails, and you alone would decide when to release them, whether to release them, and in fact, that is what happened.
[01:03:57.213 --> 01:04:01.315]  Well, Savannah, first of all, it was allowed, and I've said it wasn't the best choice.
[01:04:02.015 --> 01:04:06.977]  And every government official gets to decide what is personal and work-related.
[01:04:06.977 --> 01:04:15.240]  If I'd had two separate accounts, as many people do, obviously, I would have decided every hour what was personal, what was work-related.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:20.541]  The law also says that the official gets to determine that, and that's what I did.
[01:04:20.541 --> 01:04:25.463]  And I have gone further than anybody that I'm aware of in American history.
[01:04:25.463 --> 01:04:27.804]  Now, that's not a long history, because we haven't had emails that long.
[01:04:28.924 --> 01:04:34.627]  As long as we've had them, I've gone longer and farther to try to be as transparent as possible.
[01:04:34.627 --> 01:04:35.808]  Nobody else has done that.
[01:04:35.808 --> 01:04:40.010]  And by the time this is over, I'm a little, you know, I'm a little embarrassed.
[01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:42.831]  Ladies and gentlemen, and she also invented the internet with Al Gore.
[01:04:42.831 --> 01:04:50.315]  I mean, this is her just enjoying lying to the American people.
[01:04:50.315 --> 01:04:52.576]  The state had been incredibly secretive.
[01:04:52.576 --> 01:04:54.117]  The Clintons were incredibly secretive.
[01:04:54.117 --> 01:04:57.539]  Obama's been the most secretive ever.
[01:04:57.539 --> 01:04:57.959]  Hands down.
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:01.581]  Kit Daniels, InfoWurst.com.
[01:05:01.581 --> 01:05:06.282]  CNN reportedly altered the photo of the biracial organ shooter to make him look more white.
[01:05:06.282 --> 01:05:08.943]  That's a shocking revelation, so let me repeat that.
[01:05:08.943 --> 01:05:14.705]  CNN apparently doctored the photo of the biracial organ shooter, Christopher Mercer, to make people think he's Caucasian.
[01:05:14.705 --> 01:05:23.468]  Mercer uploaded a selfie to social media, but when CNN used the photo in its news broadcast, Mercer's skin tone had dramatically changed to that of a white man.
[01:05:23.468 --> 01:05:27.750]  Furthermore, CNN did not show photos of Mercer's mother, who is African American.
[01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:33.995]  And the network also didn't report that Mercer was involved in a school play, which contradicts the media's claim that he was a loner.
[01:05:33.995 --> 01:05:35.036]  Why would they do that?
[01:05:35.036 --> 01:05:41.382]  Because a biracial Oregon shooter does not fit into the establishment's propaganda that mass shooters are white, racist men.
[01:05:41.382 --> 01:05:48.728]  They also don't want you to know that Mercer was associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, because it would be a political nightmare for Obama if the public knew the truth.
[01:05:48.968 --> 01:05:55.597]  It'd be hard for him to demand more gun control if more people start to realize that President Obama is fueling racial division across the U.S.
[01:05:55.597 --> 01:05:59.282]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels with Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:59.282 --> 01:06:06.171]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[01:08:08.223 --> 01:08:12.324]  Raptor Man, Chase, Fabian, Charlene, Antoine, and others.
[01:08:12.324 --> 01:08:17.265]  We're going to go to your phone calls here in a moment, and then after this round of callers, I see some new callers, some old callers.
[01:08:17.265 --> 01:08:19.506]  We're going to have first-time callers today.
[01:08:19.506 --> 01:08:21.927]  After that, for the next two hours, 800-259-9231.
[01:08:21.927 --> 01:08:23.727]  800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[01:08:30.589 --> 01:08:34.870]  Now, I already mentioned a lot of the news in the last hour, but only focused on three pieces of news.
[01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:39.371]  I'm going to go back in after I take some calls at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:39.371 --> 01:08:45.113]  CNN turns mixed-race Oregon shooter, who was anti-Christian, into a white man.
[01:08:45.113 --> 01:08:53.515]  Makes his lips smaller, his nose smaller, and turns him as white as Nosferatu, or as Casper the Friendly Ghost.
[01:08:53.515 --> 01:08:56.856]  Also, Hillary Clinton has called for mass movement to eradicate Second Amendment.
[01:08:57.895 --> 01:09:00.397]  James Woods comes out with stinging tweets.
[01:09:00.397 --> 01:09:03.019]  Articles at Infowars.com.
[01:09:03.019 --> 01:09:10.946]  Again, we're going to be going over all of that and the latest moves by Obama promising to use executive action to eradicate the Second Amendment.
[01:09:10.946 --> 01:09:16.051]  Hillary's talked about eradicating the Second Amendment as well.
[01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:17.372]  The TPP has passed.
[01:09:17.372 --> 01:09:18.353]  That is globally.
[01:09:18.353 --> 01:09:20.915]  We still can't see the text of it.
[01:09:20.915 --> 01:09:21.836]  That's going to be coming up.
[01:09:23.047 --> 01:09:25.749]  And then, of course, this is really the top story this hour.
[01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:34.654]  Saudi's mull in their national conference of the royal family, thousands of princes, that's the government there.
[01:09:34.654 --> 01:09:40.338]  Saudi's mull launch of regional war as Russia pounds targets in Syria for fourth day.
[01:09:40.338 --> 01:09:44.020]  Of course, Saudi Arabia had claimed they were fighting ISIS and all this bull.
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:48.122]  It's Saudi Arabia funding it, quarterbacking it, giving them the weapons.
[01:09:48.122 --> 01:09:50.023]  A bunch of other Western countries are involved.
[01:09:50.023 --> 01:09:50.744]  It's all come out.
[01:09:52.358 --> 01:09:59.121]  And so they had some of their top government officials Thursday and Friday come out and say, we're going to escalate the conflict with you if you don't pull out.
[01:09:59.121 --> 01:10:00.461]  Well, the Russians haven't.
[01:10:00.461 --> 01:10:16.108]  So now we've got a whole slew of their government ministers in this excellent Zero Hedge article that goes through all the different publications with their quotes to give heavy weapons to the, quote, opposition to take on the Russians.
[01:10:20.444 --> 01:10:27.706]  So, huge escalation towards what would become World War III.
[01:10:27.706 --> 01:10:36.048]  Now, England is coming out, Cameron and criticizing, the UK is criticizing the Russians as well.
[01:10:36.048 --> 01:10:46.870]  The Russians have taken out the al-Nusra al-Qaeda bases, Reuters, AP, they all admit it is al-Qaeda, that's what al-Nusra is, that's the group in Syria, that's al-Qaeda in Syria, is the proper name.
[01:10:48.049 --> 01:10:48.998]  They've taken them out.
[01:10:48.998 --> 01:10:50.249]  They're now taking out ISIS.
[01:10:53.752 --> 01:11:00.358]  ISIS is the group to be given control over part of Iraq and part of Syria to create a new Saudi-run state.
[01:11:00.358 --> 01:11:02.379]  That's not the main focus of Russia right now.
[01:11:02.379 --> 01:11:07.584]  It's got to take out the leadership, the Al-Qaeda leadership, that basically commands ISIS.
[01:11:07.584 --> 01:11:09.845]  Al-Qaeda is the, quote, moderate group.
[01:11:09.845 --> 01:11:10.886]  That's Reuters.
[01:11:10.886 --> 01:11:12.688]  I read that on air last week.
[01:11:12.688 --> 01:11:13.368]  You know, the U.S.
[01:11:13.368 --> 01:11:15.130]  criticized the bombings.
[01:11:15.130 --> 01:11:19.814]  At least 60 hits on al-Nusra, Al-Qaeda in Syria base.
[01:11:23.274 --> 01:11:26.735]  And they criticize him for doing that, saying, this is the moderate rebel group.
[01:11:26.735 --> 01:11:28.216]  This is who we give the weapons to.
[01:11:28.216 --> 01:11:29.997]  This is where we command and control.
[01:11:29.997 --> 01:11:31.237]  How dare you blow it up?
[01:11:31.237 --> 01:11:32.437]  They're moderate.
[01:11:32.437 --> 01:11:34.178]  And Putin said, this is the command and control.
[01:11:34.178 --> 01:11:36.179]  They're all the same people.
[01:11:36.179 --> 01:11:37.860]  We're taking them out.
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:42.481]  So they go and give them to moderate rebels off the planes, because our military gets mad.
[01:11:42.481 --> 01:11:44.542]  A few years ago, they were giving it actually to Al Qaeda.
[01:11:44.542 --> 01:11:46.223]  We've had the whistleblowers on.
[01:11:46.223 --> 01:11:49.424]  So now they just deliver it to guys that are basically delivery companies.
[01:11:50.882 --> 01:12:00.866]  They then drive down the road in the trucks and deliver it, and the Russians have been flying around blowing up these bases that when they hit them with a 500 pound bomb, they blow up like they had 100,000 pounds in them, because they do.
[01:12:00.866 --> 01:12:09.529]  The Russians are blowing up Al-Qaeda weapons depots that are full of NATO, US, Israeli, and Saudi Arabian and Turkish weapons.
[01:12:09.529 --> 01:12:18.053]  And yes, I had a caller call in last week and go, why are you just saying Saudi Arabia is involved in Syria and 9-11 and all this stuff?
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:24.842]  Saudi Arabia is the main group that is going to run everything in the Middle East.
[01:12:24.842 --> 01:12:27.944]  It's the main client state.
[01:12:27.944 --> 01:12:29.645]  But Israel's involved.
[01:12:29.645 --> 01:12:31.466]  Turkey's involved.
[01:12:31.466 --> 01:12:33.668]  Every NATO country is involved.
[01:12:33.668 --> 01:12:34.488]  The United States.
[01:12:34.488 --> 01:12:35.349]  They're all involved.
[01:12:35.349 --> 01:12:37.530]  There's no one less involved.
[01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:38.170]  Okay?
[01:12:38.170 --> 01:12:39.271]  It's all bad.
[01:12:39.271 --> 01:12:40.191]  It's all evil.
[01:12:40.191 --> 01:12:40.892]  Let's get that straight.
[01:12:42.253 --> 01:12:46.176]  It's this mindlessness where things turn into factionalization every time.
[01:12:46.176 --> 01:12:47.898]  You're not saying it's this group, you're not saying it's that group.
[01:12:47.898 --> 01:12:48.938]  They're all involved.
[01:12:48.938 --> 01:12:53.662]  It's incredibly shameful and evil.
[01:12:53.662 --> 01:13:03.630]  Israel came out last week and said, we may have to start taking out some strikes inside Syria since the Russian forces came in because they're taking out some of the moderate rebels.
[01:13:11.092 --> 01:13:14.213]  I mean, we've really gotten to that point now.
[01:13:14.213 --> 01:13:25.357]  So, the plan is to topple Assad, give Saudi Arabia control of at least half the country, with this new Islamic State it's going to set up, so it can act like it's not in control of it and it's not running.
[01:13:25.357 --> 01:13:31.459]  And they came out again in the last year and said, we're not involved, we don't want to overthrow Syria, on and on and on.
[01:13:31.459 --> 01:13:38.142]  And now that Syria is fighting back with Russia, they're going, okay, that's it, we're going to send in heavy weapons, how dare you attack our forces?
[01:13:41.715 --> 01:13:46.178]  And people have also asked, why do you keep talking about the 28 pages and Saudi Arabia involvement in 9-11?
[01:13:46.178 --> 01:13:51.361]  Clearly NORAD stood down, clearly Building 7, clearly other governments are involved, our own government.
[01:13:51.361 --> 01:13:55.024]  I made five films, I wrote a book, I was the first guy to expose 9-11.
[01:13:55.024 --> 01:13:55.304]  The 28 pages...
[01:13:58.459 --> 01:14:08.686]  With the folks we're working with in Congress, we'll bring down the globalists to a great extent, and we'll prove they stood down with, for Saudi Arabia, bare minimum.
[01:14:08.686 --> 01:14:10.687]  That is aiding and abetting the attacks.
[01:14:10.687 --> 01:14:12.148]  They're done.
[01:14:12.148 --> 01:14:19.113]  It's like getting Al Capone on income tax fraud.
[01:14:19.113 --> 01:14:20.414]  Yeah, he killed a bunch of people.
[01:14:20.414 --> 01:14:22.535]  Yeah, he was involved in a bunch of bad stuff.
[01:14:22.535 --> 01:14:24.056]  We have them.
[01:14:24.056 --> 01:14:25.797]  They're fighting to not release it.
[01:14:25.797 --> 01:14:28.079]  The Commission went ahead and told the truth about what happened.
[01:14:29.068 --> 01:14:31.750]  Saudi Arabia just supplied Patsy's.
[01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:43.400]  And at the start of the next hour, remind me guys, because I'm bad about getting cluttered in my mind, I'm going to tie it all together with this headline, Delta Force Considered Staging Fake Hijacking After 9-11.
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.282]  We know for a fact that Delta Force
[01:14:46.536 --> 01:14:50.538]  Did mock responses to hijackings before 9-11.
[01:14:50.538 --> 01:14:52.519]  And I'm not giving out anything classified.
[01:14:52.519 --> 01:14:54.160]  The CIA admitted that.
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.241]  The Pentagon admitted that.
[01:14:55.241 --> 01:15:02.885]  In the two years leading up to 9-11, they did more than 25 operations we know of.
[01:15:02.885 --> 01:15:12.571]  And we know that Mohammed Adda and others were part of similar operations, were at US military bases, and were taking part in drills.
[01:15:12.571 --> 01:15:13.031]  Look it up!
[01:15:15.956 --> 01:15:22.700]  They were part of drills, so we don't know exactly what happened.
[01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:27.824]  Were they triple crossers?
[01:15:27.824 --> 01:15:31.826]  I'm not even introducing that idea.
[01:15:31.826 --> 01:15:39.031]  All I'm saying is, we know the official story is as phony as Hillary Clinton saying she's the most transparent person in U.S.
[01:15:39.031 --> 01:15:39.311]  history.
[01:15:41.297 --> 01:15:49.142]  Or Obama saying it's a conspiracy theory that he wants our guns as the gun groups they finance are for the total abolition of civilian ownership of firearms.
[01:15:49.142 --> 01:15:53.264]  And in places like Chicago, New York, and D.C., they get total gun bans in place.
[01:15:53.264 --> 01:15:54.805]  And they've done it all over the world.
[01:15:54.805 --> 01:16:01.789]  And he sits there with a straight face, and I'm going to your calls, saying no one wants your guns.
[01:16:01.789 --> 01:16:04.831]  So, I don't know what happened on 9-11.
[01:16:04.831 --> 01:16:09.054]  I know there is so much evidence pointing in every direction that it was staged.
[01:16:10.558 --> 01:16:12.199]  And there's a cover-up.
[01:16:12.199 --> 01:16:15.922]  And the whole thing is tied to one string, the 28 pages.
[01:16:15.922 --> 01:16:23.228]  You pull that 28 pages out, it doesn't just blame Saudi Arabia.
[01:16:23.228 --> 01:16:28.552]  It brings down the whole house of cards, just like I told you Syria four years ago.
[01:16:28.552 --> 01:16:34.336]  If we could stop the takedown of Syria, and the fact that our government was funding Al-Qaeda, that would bring down the whole house of cards.
[01:16:34.336 --> 01:16:36.438]  And we told you next stop after Libya was Syria.
[01:16:36.438 --> 01:16:38.139]  We know the globalist plan, folks.
[01:16:38.139 --> 01:16:39.100]  I know what I'm talking about.
[01:16:40.714 --> 01:16:42.996]  I live this stuff.
[01:16:42.996 --> 01:16:46.518]  The New World Order is not invincible, and you know why they're not invincible?
[01:16:46.518 --> 01:16:58.206]  Because there is a God in this universe, but even as important, because it's the same statement, there are good people in government, there are good people in Congress, there are good people in corporations, in private people.
[01:16:58.206 --> 01:17:09.494]  The average person in government doesn't want to do this, doesn't want baby flavoring and Pepsi, doesn't want to be funding Al-Nusra and Al-Qaeda groups, doesn't want to have cancer viruses in the polio shots,
[01:17:10.725 --> 01:17:19.234]  But they're compartmentalized, they get bullied, they get attacked when they try to speak up, and they're waiting for the people to not be cowards and stand up.
[01:17:19.234 --> 01:17:22.858]  To give them the strength they need to clean things up.
[01:17:22.858 --> 01:17:32.268]  That's why I want to do an intro for V for Vendetta, but not just the one we have where he takes over TV and he's talking to folks, but where he's talking to the police captain.
[01:17:33.424 --> 01:17:34.846]  He says, why did you go public sooner?
[01:17:34.846 --> 01:17:37.388]  Why didn't you start fighting back earlier?
[01:17:37.388 --> 01:17:39.971]  He said, I was waiting for you, Inspector.
[01:17:39.971 --> 01:17:44.296]  I was waiting for you.
[01:17:44.296 --> 01:17:44.636]  See?
[01:17:44.636 --> 01:17:48.560]  Couldn't do it alone.
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:50.342]  And so, you want to know how to fix all this?
[01:17:50.342 --> 01:17:53.325]  Look in the mirror, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:53.325 --> 01:17:55.147]  I've always known that if I take action,
[01:17:56.178 --> 01:17:57.218]  And get others to take action.
[01:17:57.218 --> 01:17:58.879]  We can defeat these people because history shows that.
[01:17:58.879 --> 01:18:00.719]  But if you don't believe in that, then we don't have a chance.
[01:18:00.719 --> 01:18:01.359]  We're going to go to break.
[01:18:01.359 --> 01:18:05.780]  We're going to chase Raptor Man, Fabian, Charlene, Antoine, everybody else.
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:08.820]  Then I'll get into all that other news I mentioned.
[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:13.501]  Briefly, this hour is brought to you by the amazing products at Infowarslife.com.

[01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:25.619]  We're getting to the very tail end of that.
[01:19:25.619 --> 01:19:29.480]  Will probably be sold out of SurvivalShield, Nasodinone within days, but should only be
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:32.282]  A month or so until more of that comes in.
[01:19:32.282 --> 01:19:33.462]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:19:33.462 --> 01:19:33.943]  Knockout.

[01:20:29.386 --> 01:20:34.588]  Turn on the news and you'll hear stories of natural disasters, political unrest, and financial crisis.
[01:20:34.588 --> 01:20:38.569]  In times of uncertainty, how will you take care of your family's most basic needs?

[01:20:59.395 --> 01:21:03.658]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[01:21:03.658 --> 01:21:07.921]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[01:21:07.921 --> 01:21:15.266]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Mason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[01:21:15.266 --> 01:21:25.933]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[01:21:25.933 --> 01:21:28.715]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[01:21:29.175 --> 01:21:29.755]  We're good to go.
[01:21:58.954 --> 01:22:03.197]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:03.197 --> 01:22:03.818]  It's true.
[01:22:03.818 --> 01:22:07.981]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:07.981 --> 01:22:10.363]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:10.363 --> 01:22:14.846]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[01:24:03.277 --> 01:24:06.659]  Here's Obama saying it's a conspiracy theory that he wants your guns.
[01:24:06.659 --> 01:24:09.480]  They just reminded me that I said he said this, but why not actually play it?
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:15.864]  It's like when he said that raising the debt limit doesn't raise the national debt, you've got to play it to believe it.
[01:24:15.864 --> 01:24:19.806]  Or the clips where he says, no one wants your guns, no one's coming for your guns.
[01:24:19.806 --> 01:24:27.310]  I mean, that's as bad as Mars attacks with the aliens running around shooting people saying, don't run, we are your friends.
[01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:28.711]  Let's go ahead and go to this latest clip.
[01:24:30.655 --> 01:24:32.176]  The politics has to change.
[01:24:32.176 --> 01:24:50.381]  And the people who are troubled by this have to be as intense and as organized and as adamant about this issue as folks on the other side who are absolutists and think that any gun safety measures are somehow... You're not getting our guns, scumbag!
[01:24:50.381 --> 01:24:53.142]  ...an assault on freedom are communistic.
[01:24:53.142 --> 01:24:58.304]  Or a plot by me to, you know, take over.
[01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:04.854]  No, the globalists are staying in power.
[01:25:04.854 --> 01:25:06.115]  That really freaks you out, doesn't it?
[01:25:06.115 --> 01:25:07.156]  You know who he's addressing?
[01:25:07.156 --> 01:25:07.896]  He's talking about us there.
[01:25:07.896 --> 01:25:08.557]  A judge.
[01:25:29.289 --> 01:25:31.771]  Well, okay, here's what you need to do.
[01:25:31.771 --> 01:25:41.400]  You have to make sure that anybody who you are voting for- You have to hire enough illegal aliens, bring them in, get them to vote.
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:42.762]  That's what they're doing.
[01:25:42.762 --> 01:25:45.284]  For a couple of election cycles, you've got to vote against them.
[01:25:45.284 --> 01:25:49.668]  And let them know precisely why you're voting against them.
[01:25:49.668 --> 01:25:50.309]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:25:50.309 --> 01:25:51.310]  Shut him off.
[01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:52.431]  I've got to go to calls here.
[01:25:53.988 --> 01:26:00.893]  They take these tragedies, 167 people, 166, it varies every year, but that's the average, 160 in the last decade every year.
[01:26:00.893 --> 01:26:03.815]  166.
[01:26:03.815 --> 01:26:05.396]  That die in mass shootings.
[01:26:05.396 --> 01:26:16.164]  And they act like it's the end of the world, and they show each person that died, and personalize them, which is fine, if you did that for the 300,000 people Al-Qaeda killed in Syria, that you sent in there.
[01:26:16.164 --> 01:26:22.629]  You more than anybody, Obama, as the big front man, leading America against the evil Assad, who didn't do anything!
[01:26:23.567 --> 01:26:29.470]  And then the 50 plus million babies, and just the vets not being given treatment by the tens of thousands dying.
[01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:43.918]  And then you sit there and shake some dead people, killed by some biracial, socialist, gun-hating, Christian-hating scumbag, probably did it to get guns banned, probably wound up by some psychiatrist.
[01:26:45.404 --> 01:26:50.929]  And then you tell me collectively and our listeners that we're to blame because we believe there's a takeover plot.
[01:26:50.929 --> 01:26:52.991]  Look at this headline right here out of Breitbart.
[01:26:52.991 --> 01:26:56.134]  And then my crew didn't just believe this, okay?
[01:26:56.134 --> 01:27:02.399]  They went to the Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch announces the launch of Strong Cities Network in the United Nations General Assembly.
[01:27:02.399 --> 01:27:04.702]  We have the remarks right here, what she says!
[01:27:06.084 --> 01:27:16.754]  They announce a UN police force to fight extremism in the US, then they quote reports that say veterans and gun owners are the number one enemy.
[01:27:16.754 --> 01:27:20.718]  When you dig in deeper.
[01:27:20.718 --> 01:27:25.302]  Oh, there's no communistic plot, there's nothing happening, there's no problem, none of this is going on.
[01:27:25.302 --> 01:27:27.504]  You're right, it's a globalist fascist plot.
[01:27:27.504 --> 01:27:29.606]  Uses a lot of communist techniques, but it's not communist.
[01:27:31.977 --> 01:27:33.578]  And they hate the fact that we see who they are.
[01:27:33.578 --> 01:27:37.981]  They hate the fact they can't mesmerize us anymore, and we know you're a bunch of crooks!
[01:27:37.981 --> 01:27:40.683]  Two plus two equals four, man!
[01:27:40.683 --> 01:27:43.585]  I did build my business.
[01:27:43.585 --> 01:27:48.328]  You are someone that hates the bitter clingers that cling to their guns and their Bibles.
[01:27:48.328 --> 01:27:51.410]  You have come to radically transform this America.
[01:27:51.410 --> 01:27:53.872]  You have come to screw everybody over.
[01:27:53.872 --> 01:27:58.935]  You got the Republicans basically giving you the orders how to do it, the neocons, and we're sick of it!
[01:27:58.935 --> 01:27:59.916]  We're tired of it!
[01:28:01.274 --> 01:28:03.795]  And the numbers show the American people are sick of it.
[01:28:03.795 --> 01:28:04.715]  Let's go to Raptor Man.
[01:28:04.715 --> 01:28:05.695]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:28:05.695 --> 01:28:08.336]  Raptor Man from New York.
[01:28:08.336 --> 01:28:09.757]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:28:09.757 --> 01:28:10.297]  I'm okay.
[01:28:10.297 --> 01:28:13.118]  Watching that clip is really creepy though.
[01:28:13.118 --> 01:28:14.138]  I know.
[01:28:14.138 --> 01:28:19.920]  I got three points to make about what you were saying earlier about the globalists' long-term plan.
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:21.440]  One's pretty funny actually.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:24.701]  You go to Nelson Rockefeller on Wikipedia.
[01:28:24.701 --> 01:28:25.641]  Scroll down a little bit.
[01:28:25.641 --> 01:28:29.543]  There's a nice picture of him with a poster of Obamacare in 1954.
[01:28:31.584 --> 01:28:33.104]  Well, I'll probably take that off there.
[01:28:33.104 --> 01:28:33.364]  Really?
[01:28:33.364 --> 01:28:35.525]  What does it say?
[01:28:35.525 --> 01:28:39.426]  It's a poster of Nelson Rockefeller standing there with Obamacare.
[01:28:39.426 --> 01:28:40.946]  The exact Obamacare plan.
[01:28:40.946 --> 01:28:41.926]  Go to Wikipedia.
[01:28:41.926 --> 01:28:43.027]  Nelson Rockefeller.
[01:28:43.027 --> 01:28:43.787]  Oh, of course.
[01:28:43.787 --> 01:28:44.367]  Scroll down.
[01:28:44.367 --> 01:28:45.627]  Yeah, we've got it on screen.
[01:28:45.627 --> 01:28:47.228]  You're saying basically the same system.
[01:28:47.228 --> 01:28:50.008]  Oh yeah, they've always wanted it.
[01:28:50.008 --> 01:28:52.069]  1954, so it's a long-term plan.
[01:28:52.069 --> 01:28:56.630]  Also, I got two other points about some research I was doing.
[01:28:56.630 --> 01:29:01.031]  You know, I was watching a LaRouche PAC video about energy, flux, density.
[01:29:01.767 --> 01:29:05.731]  It's basically the amount of energy they're going to give us in the future, the projections.
[01:29:19.557 --> 01:29:20.497]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:20.497 --> 01:29:28.962]  So, even if they ramp up the energy production now, like a Manhattan Project to ramp up energy, it's still not going to be enough to support the billions of people in the future.
[01:29:28.962 --> 01:29:29.242]  That's right.
[01:29:29.242 --> 01:29:30.883]  They've already sabotaged us.
[01:29:30.883 --> 01:29:31.323]  Stay there.
[01:29:31.323 --> 01:29:32.564]  You're so smart.
[01:29:32.564 --> 01:29:36.245]  And I didn't know LaRouche PAC exposed that, but they're very on target with their analysis.
[01:29:36.245 --> 01:29:39.807]  I don't agree with some of their in-game stuff, but their analysis is spot on.
[01:29:39.807 --> 01:29:43.749]  I mean, I'm aware they're exposing eugenics, but I'd like to hear what they said when we come back.
[01:29:43.749 --> 01:29:46.711]  And then we'll go to Chase, Fabian, Charlene, and Antoine.
[01:29:46.711 --> 01:29:47.151]  Stay with us.
[01:29:48.661 --> 01:29:52.604]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.604 --> 01:29:59.510]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.510 --> 01:30:01.571]  Kit Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[01:30:01.571 --> 01:30:05.394]  President Obama implied that the federal government should confiscate all guns.
[01:30:05.394 --> 01:30:06.135]  That's right.
[01:30:06.135 --> 01:30:11.339]  The president responsible for the deaths of women and children via drone strikes is now trying to eradicate the Second Amendment.
[01:30:11.339 --> 01:30:15.062]  When Obama responded to the October 1st attack on an Oregon community college,
[01:30:15.342 --> 01:30:22.246]  He went beyond his usual demand for more gun control and suggested that America should consider outright banning guns just like Australia and Great Britain.
[01:30:22.246 --> 01:30:30.891]  But it's hypocritical for Obama to demand that Americans turn in their guns when, according to the Pentagon, the Obama administration is backing ISIS in its war against the Syrian government.
[01:30:30.891 --> 01:30:36.454]  In fact, in September 2013, President Obama waived a federal law specifically designed to keep the U.S.
[01:30:36.454 --> 01:30:39.615]  government from supplying firearms to terrorist groups such as ISIS.
[01:30:39.615 --> 01:30:43.317]  On the very same day, he demanded more gun control in response to the D.C.
[01:30:43.317 --> 01:30:44.078]  Navy Yard shooting.
[01:30:44.398 --> 01:30:51.880]  In other words, Obama is shipping guns to Islamic militants, aka moderate rebels, while simultaneously trying to disarm American citizens.
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:59.282]  Once again, this is Kent Daniels with TheInfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv, and check out our new YouTube channel called Resistance News.
[01:30:59.282 --> 01:31:02.784]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:02.784 --> 01:31:07.705]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:31:07.705 --> 01:31:08.266]  We're good to go.
[01:31:29.190 --> 01:31:30.291]  Brain Force is here.
[01:31:30.291 --> 01:31:32.493]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:31:32.493 --> 01:31:37.496]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[01:31:37.496 --> 01:31:40.779]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:31:40.779 --> 01:31:44.262]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:31:44.262 --> 01:31:46.003]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:31:46.223 --> 01:31:47.163]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[01:31:47.163 --> 01:31:48.344]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:31:48.344 --> 01:31:50.345]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:31:50.345 --> 01:31:58.869]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:31:58.869 --> 01:32:04.291]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[01:32:04.631 --> 01:32:05.212]  We're good to go.
[01:32:19.548 --> 01:32:27.310]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[01:32:27.310 --> 01:32:32.892]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[01:32:32.892 --> 01:32:36.453]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[01:32:36.453 --> 01:32:40.594]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[01:32:40.594 --> 01:32:44.475]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[01:32:44.895 --> 01:32:49.042]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.

[01:33:19.801 --> 01:33:24.446]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:24.446 --> 01:33:25.888]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:25.888 --> 01:33:26.368]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:26.368 --> 01:33:26.709]  Central.
[01:33:28.513 --> 01:33:32.695]  Then we return, weeknight, 7 o'clock central for InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:33:32.695 --> 01:33:35.236]  Find details at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:35.236 --> 01:33:36.917]  And of course, Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:36.917 --> 01:33:37.638]  central.
[01:33:37.638 --> 01:33:39.138]  David Knight hosted this Sunday.
[01:33:39.138 --> 01:33:40.939]  I'll be hosting the next two Sundays.
[01:33:40.939 --> 01:33:45.362]  It's good to have David back after he took a week off with his family.
[01:33:45.362 --> 01:33:47.943]  We got Paul Watson hosting the fourth hour today.
[01:33:47.943 --> 01:33:49.584]  We brought that back.
[01:33:49.584 --> 01:33:54.866]  A big roundtable discussion on political correctness and more.
[01:33:54.866 --> 01:33:57.908]  Well, we're certainly on the highway to the danger zone right now.
[01:33:59.636 --> 01:34:08.558]  With the Saudis, and I'm going to be getting to that after we take more calls, escalating and saying they may go toe-to-toe with the Russians.
[01:34:08.558 --> 01:34:13.239]  In a proxy war, in Syria.
[01:34:13.239 --> 01:34:18.161]  And basically, what Putin's trying to do is maintain Russian interests.
[01:34:18.161 --> 01:34:21.721]  They're not on offense, they're on the defense.
[01:34:21.721 --> 01:34:23.542]  But now they're offensively on the defense.
[01:34:25.319 --> 01:34:34.742]  And what they're trying to do is draw attention politically to who the West is backing, and force the West to openly back the main rebels, which are Al Qaeda.
[01:34:34.742 --> 01:34:35.883]  They've been backing them.
[01:34:35.883 --> 01:34:51.608]  They're just forcing a debate about that, and now that debate's happening, not just within the US military, like it was four years ago, three years ago, two years ago, not just Rand Paul coming out and saying we're not Al Qaeda's air force, but now it's a global debate, and it's really exposing how radical Islam
[01:34:53.172 --> 01:34:56.355]  Is being directed by Western powers via Saudi Arabia.
[01:34:56.355 --> 01:35:02.479]  And they're being forced to say, well, we want to do this to bring down Iran.
[01:35:02.479 --> 01:35:06.082]  So to bring down Iran, you're going to bring down Syria and put Al Qaeda in charge?
[01:35:06.082 --> 01:35:07.063]  That's not a very good idea.
[01:35:09.718 --> 01:35:18.684]  I mean, I wouldn't cry if they opened up Iran and the mullahs weren't in power, and Iran could industrialize and be free, and they didn't have thought police on the streets.
[01:35:18.684 --> 01:35:21.066]  But it's not our country to run.
[01:35:21.066 --> 01:35:29.631]  In 1953, a pro-America president was overthrown by the CIA in Operation Ajax, Mohammed Mosaddegh.
[01:35:29.631 --> 01:35:30.412]  And you know how they did it?
[01:35:30.412 --> 01:35:35.896]  They blew up mosques, and they blamed it on Mohammed Mosaddegh, who was secular.
[01:35:36.701 --> 01:35:39.142]  Then they had the Jihadis overthrow the government.
[01:35:39.142 --> 01:35:41.884]  Then they had the military remove them.
[01:35:41.884 --> 01:35:43.184]  They could be rolled up quickly.
[01:35:43.184 --> 01:35:45.365]  Then they put the Shah in.
[01:35:45.365 --> 01:35:47.186]  Then the Shah didn't play ball.
[01:35:47.186 --> 01:35:54.290]  So they gave him a fast-acting cancer, killed him in two weeks, and brought in the Ayatollah Khomeini.
[01:35:54.290 --> 01:36:00.733]  Our government, with the British and the French, put the mullahs in Iran.
[01:36:00.733 --> 01:36:02.054]  Then we had a deal with them to do the
[01:36:03.018 --> 01:36:05.500]  Grabbing on the hostages to make Jimmy Carter look bad.
[01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:06.821]  Then Iran-Contra.
[01:36:06.821 --> 01:36:09.944]  That was all done behind the scenes.
[01:36:09.944 --> 01:36:13.006]  You want to say anything Ronald Reagan did was bad?
[01:36:13.006 --> 01:36:14.247]  It was that.
[01:36:14.247 --> 01:36:16.449]  He knew about that.
[01:36:16.449 --> 01:36:17.470]  He knew about Iran-Contra.
[01:36:17.470 --> 01:36:18.270]  The day... The day...
[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:25.063]  Before he came into office, they started releasing the people.
[01:36:25.063 --> 01:36:26.524]  They were scared of Reagan.
[01:36:26.524 --> 01:36:27.705]  They were scared he was going to do something.
[01:36:27.705 --> 01:36:29.747]  No, it was a setup, folks.
[01:36:29.747 --> 01:36:30.748]  Iran-Contra.
[01:36:30.748 --> 01:36:37.655]  Tow missiles and a bunch of other high-tech weapons and an agreement to leave Iran alone, if they did all that.
[01:36:37.655 --> 01:36:40.578]  But wait, it gets worse, and I'll go to your calls.
[01:36:40.578 --> 01:36:42.139]  Then they tell Saddam Hussein,
[01:36:43.297 --> 01:36:48.541]  Two years later, go ahead and launch an attack now on these oil fields and take them.
[01:36:48.541 --> 01:36:53.065]  We're going to give you the satellites, we're going to give you the nerve gas, we're going to give you all the imaging you need, everything else.
[01:36:53.065 --> 01:36:57.769]  And then they set Saddam up in 1990.
[01:36:57.769 --> 01:36:59.550]  Tell him, go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[01:36:59.550 --> 01:37:05.195]  Yeah, you're right, they're slant drilling, you're our ally, we're not going to get involved in inter-Arab affairs, you've got the green light.
[01:37:05.195 --> 01:37:07.357]  April Gillespie told him, he invaded two weeks later.
[01:37:10.011 --> 01:37:12.933]  Just setting all these countries up, bringing them down.
[01:37:12.933 --> 01:37:13.893]  It's evil.
[01:37:13.893 --> 01:37:17.335]  America shouldn't be doing it.
[01:37:17.335 --> 01:37:19.016]  And now people know about it.
[01:37:19.016 --> 01:37:20.416]  Raptor Man, thank you for holding them.
[01:37:20.416 --> 01:37:21.517]  I'm going to get to everybody now.
[01:37:21.517 --> 01:37:21.957]  I'm done.
[01:37:21.957 --> 01:37:24.098]  I just was wound up from the weekend.
[01:37:24.098 --> 01:37:24.839]  Raptor Man, go ahead.
[01:37:24.839 --> 01:37:25.719]  You were making some great points.
[01:37:25.719 --> 01:37:26.360]  Start back over.
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:29.021]  Yeah, that's alright, Alex.
[01:37:29.710 --> 01:37:38.896]  Yeah, that picture of Nelson Rockefeller on Wikipedia with the Obamacare plan, it'd be interesting if they'll change that now or not, if enough of your listeners look at it.
[01:37:38.896 --> 01:37:39.836]  Absolutely.
[01:37:39.836 --> 01:37:51.263]  But, yeah, but the, you know, my point about the energy flux density projections is the fact that they need to increase the energy production before the population comes.
[01:37:51.263 --> 01:37:54.305]  And they're already lowering energy production, so even if they start now,
[01:37:55.205 --> 01:37:58.686]  They still won't be enough to support the people that are projected to be on Merck.
[01:37:58.686 --> 01:38:00.887]  They're not planning on having that many people.
[01:38:00.887 --> 01:38:03.007]  As you say, it's a long-term plan.
[01:38:03.007 --> 01:38:11.690]  Oh, I've seen the UN projections, the Club of Rome, it's admitted that population's going up, supposed to peak at 9 billion, while energy is going down.
[01:38:11.690 --> 01:38:16.411]  It's meant to artificially cut it off, but the problem is, we've got enough coal for thousands of years.
[01:38:16.411 --> 01:38:20.132]  We can burn it clean, so they've got to turn coal off worldwide.
[01:38:21.791 --> 01:38:22.831]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:38:22.831 --> 01:38:26.172]  You know, it dovetails exactly with I was doing some casual research.
[01:38:26.172 --> 01:38:34.694]  I was reading Harvey Dunn's book there, and he says that it's going to be a massive wealth transfer in the next 10 years from baby boomers to the next generation.
[01:38:34.694 --> 01:38:39.635]  And for Agenda 21's sake, it occurred to me that that wealth transfer cannot take place.
[01:38:39.635 --> 01:38:44.056]  I mean, what you're seeing now with the stock markets going down, he says, you know, it's going to go down to $6,000, $8,000.
[01:38:45.436 --> 01:38:47.717]  I mean, they cannot allow that transfer to happen.
[01:38:47.717 --> 01:38:48.618]  They've suffered enough.
[01:38:48.618 --> 01:38:53.940]  They've got to take their cut, but the younger generation will not get that wealth transfer.
[01:38:53.940 --> 01:39:04.426]  And that's why they're teaching the younger generation not to care about wealth or stability or security, but to care about cultural things, being obsessed with how you speak, what you do.
[01:39:04.426 --> 01:39:14.491]  They're turning the younger generations into literal cult members who run around enforcing on each other and showing who's more politically correct.
[01:39:15.427 --> 01:39:31.915]  And they have nothing, they're totally destitute, they're totally unhappy, they're unfulfilled, so they keep doubling and tripling and quadrupling down on whatever the Daily Show says, whatever the trendies say, whatever the university says, and they're in a total prison.
[01:39:31.915 --> 01:39:33.976]  It's just so sad to see these useful idiots.
[01:39:33.976 --> 01:39:36.077]  God bless you.
[01:39:36.077 --> 01:39:38.238]  Chase in Colorado, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:39:41.403 --> 01:40:02.150]  I just wanted to say I'm 18, I've supported InfoWars since I was 11, and yeah, about the Second Amendment, teachers, you know, I mean, just because mass shootings seem to be going up doesn't mean that the Second Amendment gets taken away.
[01:40:02.150 --> 01:40:04.470]  That's the most backwards thing I've ever heard.
[01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:05.711]  But they're not going up.
[01:40:05.711 --> 01:40:09.552]  You know the LA Times saying, mass shootings down, perception is they're up.
[01:40:11.004 --> 01:40:11.804]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:11.804 --> 01:40:19.367]  And when stuff really goes down, school teachers are going to be like some of the first people to be drug out of the city and shot.
[01:40:19.367 --> 01:40:24.328]  Well, that's exactly what they were saying at the Oregon shooting was that it was a death trap.
[01:40:24.328 --> 01:40:30.550]  Everyone was just told to grovel and men with guns weren't allowed in from outside who wanted to protect people.
[01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:33.912]  It's just this culture of stand down, do nothing, get in a fetal position.
[01:40:33.912 --> 01:40:37.913]  No, getting in a fetal position is how you die.
[01:40:37.913 --> 01:40:38.113]  Right.
[01:40:39.219 --> 01:40:42.101]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:42.101 --> 01:40:42.961]  Well, God bless you.
[01:40:42.961 --> 01:40:43.962]  I appreciate your call, Chase.
[01:40:43.962 --> 01:40:46.924]  Good to have you on board for nine, ten years.
[01:40:46.924 --> 01:40:48.725]  Fabian in FEMA Region 5.
[01:40:48.725 --> 01:40:50.626]  You're on the air.
[01:40:50.626 --> 01:40:50.946]  Yes.
[01:40:50.946 --> 01:40:52.007]  Hi, Alex.
[01:40:52.007 --> 01:40:53.487]  Welcome.
[01:40:53.487 --> 01:40:56.389]  Letting you know about a little other piece of propaganda.
[01:40:56.389 --> 01:40:57.890]  Speaking of the U.N.
[01:40:57.890 --> 01:41:05.694]  and the sheep and the sheepettes, as I call them, there is a new YouTube video, fairly new, a couple weeks.
[01:41:07.068 --> 01:41:18.320]  And I'm disgusted that they even use the term, we the people, but there's a new video that's we the people for the global goals.
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:24.647]  And it is, you know, they've got all the stars and starlets out there pushing, you know, oh, we're not going to.
[01:41:25.283 --> 01:41:28.344]  You know, people will no longer be in poverty.
[01:41:28.344 --> 01:41:30.685]  Nobody's ever going to be hungry again.
[01:41:30.685 --> 01:41:33.406]  I know, I saw the video a few weeks ago.
[01:41:33.406 --> 01:41:34.726]  I meant to play it.
[01:41:34.726 --> 01:41:37.747]  And we've got this meeting coming up in Paris to get it all done.
[01:41:37.747 --> 01:41:39.688]  Everything's going to be free now.
[01:41:39.688 --> 01:41:41.328]  Oh, but five years ago we got the treaty.
[01:41:41.328 --> 01:41:45.270]  The last time it basically doubles the taxes on the third world, the carbon taxes.
[01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:48.791]  They promised the third world we're going to tax the wealthy and give you freebies.
[01:41:48.791 --> 01:41:50.411]  Just do what we say.
[01:41:50.411 --> 01:41:51.612]  Just support this.
[01:41:51.612 --> 01:41:52.592]  Everything's going to be free.
[01:41:53.172 --> 01:41:54.334]  Just take the shot!
[01:41:54.334 --> 01:41:55.155]  We love you!
[01:41:55.155 --> 01:41:55.696]  We love you!
[01:41:55.696 --> 01:41:56.938]  We love you!
[01:41:56.938 --> 01:41:57.218]  Oh, we love you!
[01:42:01.556 --> 01:42:12.760]  Yeah, I'd love to see your crew break that down, because it's pretty disgusting how they're just pushing all this stuff, and not a bit of it's going to be true, so... Yeah, no, it's sustainable development, which is the global carbon tax.
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:14.080]  I've seen the video.
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:17.681]  We've got it on screen, and I do want to do an analysis of the propaganda.
[01:42:17.681 --> 01:42:21.843]  In fact, one big thing I've dropped the ball on, and also some of the other crew has, I mean, they're doing a great job.
[01:42:21.843 --> 01:42:30.706]  We just need to focus on propaganda cartoons, propaganda pieces, propaganda trailers put out by different institutions to then analyze
[01:42:31.906 --> 01:42:44.952]  the pieces under fair use and break them down and just fact check them at every level that this global goals from the UN is a death sentence for a billion people.
[01:42:44.952 --> 01:42:46.852]  Anything else, Fabian?
[01:42:46.852 --> 01:42:48.453]  Well, yeah, I'll reiterate.
[01:42:48.453 --> 01:43:00.238]  I called in about a week ago to tell you about the propaganda piece that NBC News did live there where the pregnant migrant collapsed right at his feet while he was
[01:43:02.655 --> 01:43:07.026]  I did see that, and I don't know if we did a blurb on that.
[01:43:07.026 --> 01:43:08.189]  What was the headline on the video again?
[01:43:08.993 --> 01:43:15.777]  The video is out there, but... It's like Richard Engel drops what he's doing to help Collapse Woman.
[01:43:15.777 --> 01:43:16.577]  I saw the video.
[01:43:16.577 --> 01:43:18.118]  Just totally ridiculous.
[01:43:18.118 --> 01:43:20.159]  Just like the Pope kid was fake.
[01:43:20.159 --> 01:43:22.260]  All of it's completely fake.
[01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:28.264]  Richard Engel shows his humanity when pregnant refugee collapses on NBC.
[01:43:28.264 --> 01:43:30.865]  Oh, that's the Huffington Post.
[01:43:30.865 --> 01:43:32.286]  Oh, that's George Soros.
[01:43:32.286 --> 01:43:33.326]  He loves you.
[01:43:33.326 --> 01:43:34.447]  He wants to help you.
[01:43:35.592 --> 01:43:37.193]  See how fake it is?
[01:43:37.193 --> 01:43:39.635]  Well, I guess when you've got the glasses on you can.
[01:43:39.635 --> 01:43:47.640]  But anyway, yeah, it was just big fake business right there in your face just to try to pull America's heartstrings.
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:55.706]  Well, I mean, CNN reduced the size of his nose, his lips, and made him white when they turned the mixed-race shooter into a white man and said he was a white supremacist.
[01:43:55.706 --> 01:43:57.327]  I mean, this is what they do.
[01:43:57.327 --> 01:43:58.248]  They prey on us.
[01:43:59.068 --> 01:44:04.091]  They love it, and they've gotten to a point now where they legalized domestic propaganda last year.
[01:44:04.091 --> 01:44:09.794]  Now Obama signed an executive order two weeks ago to engage in PSYOPs directly against us using the Pentagon.
[01:44:09.794 --> 01:44:12.776]  I mean, they are taking the gloves off, folks.
[01:44:12.776 --> 01:44:16.518]  God bless you, I appreciate your call, Fabian.
[01:44:16.518 --> 01:44:26.063]  And to those of us aware of all this, it seems ridiculous and, you know, CNN is comedy, MSNBC is comedy.
[01:44:26.063 --> 01:44:27.804]  You've got to understand, maybe 30-40% of the public
[01:44:29.997 --> 01:44:32.839]  Cannot tie their shoelaces or find their butt with both hands.
[01:44:32.839 --> 01:44:34.240]  I'm serious.
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:37.203]  And another 20 or so percent know it's all a fraud.
[01:44:37.203 --> 01:44:39.625]  This is the best numbers I can come up with.
[01:44:39.625 --> 01:44:41.226]  This is a dead reckoning.
[01:44:41.226 --> 01:44:42.947]  Maybe 20, 25 percent, maybe 30.
[01:44:42.947 --> 01:44:44.789]  It's probably 25 percent.
[01:44:44.789 --> 01:44:56.258]  Are sociopathic now and know it's evil and know it's a fraud and have chosen to just get on the bandwagon because they think they're on the winning team.
[01:44:56.258 --> 01:44:57.439]  And I really figured this out.
[01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:01.801]  That's the group we ought to be targeting.
[01:45:01.801 --> 01:45:05.122]  Explaining to them, you're not going to get any power out of this.
[01:45:05.122 --> 01:45:07.183]  You're not going to save yourself.
[01:45:07.183 --> 01:45:13.805]  You're not going to even midterm produce a good world with what you're doing for yourself.
[01:45:13.805 --> 01:45:18.687]  Do you understand screwing other people over will end up coming back on everybody.
[01:45:18.687 --> 01:45:28.451]  The problem is those type of people though just enjoy cheating and being deceptive and screwing folks over so even if it destroys them they won't listen.
[01:45:29.696 --> 01:45:33.017]  So maybe I'm wrong.
[01:45:33.017 --> 01:45:43.719]  But then you got about 30-40% that are really awake and know what's going on.
[01:45:43.719 --> 01:45:49.121]  But they feel disempowered and don't know what to do because it's such a big problem.
[01:45:49.121 --> 01:45:54.682]  The biggest thing I would do is don't even argue the merits with these people with their fake debates.
[01:45:54.682 --> 01:45:58.223]  Go to the beginning of it and point out how it's all a set staged agenda
[01:45:59.414 --> 01:46:05.419]  To enslave us and dehumanize us, and every time they're pushing some agenda, it's not even what they say it is.
[01:46:05.419 --> 01:46:07.701]  It's a total false reality.
[01:46:07.701 --> 01:46:09.603]  These people don't know what they're talking about.
[01:46:09.603 --> 01:46:12.746]  They're pseudo-intellectuals.
[01:46:12.746 --> 01:46:18.271]  So they just repeat talking points at us, because they have nothing.
[01:46:18.271 --> 01:46:19.291]  They're chumps.
[01:46:19.291 --> 01:46:20.613]  They're idiots.
[01:46:20.613 --> 01:46:24.636]  They're totally in the hands of incredibly wicked people.
[01:46:24.636 --> 01:46:26.458]  They've bought into a lie, and they can't admit it.
[01:46:27.918 --> 01:46:33.762]  I can't tell you how many people have come to me over the years with Nigerian scams and other scams.
[01:46:33.762 --> 01:46:43.288]  And they've said, you need to invest in Nigeria, you need to invest with this prince, you need to, we're all going to get a ton of money when we do this.
[01:46:43.288 --> 01:46:46.750]  And they get mad when I tell them it's a fraud.
[01:46:46.750 --> 01:46:50.493]  And then they even invest in the fraud.
[01:46:50.493 --> 01:46:52.614]  And then down the road will never speak to me again.
[01:46:52.614 --> 01:46:53.955]  I've had this happen with four different people.
[01:46:55.404 --> 01:47:01.113]  And they hate me when I've, one person really looks like they hate me when I sing them.
[01:47:01.113 --> 01:47:03.277]  Because they can't admit they got screwed over.
[01:47:03.277 --> 01:47:04.599]  They didn't learn from it.
[01:47:04.599 --> 01:47:09.026]  They just thought I was trying to keep them from being successful.
[01:47:12.213 --> 01:47:13.833]  And that's what these Obama supporters are.
[01:47:13.833 --> 01:47:14.894]  They just get into it.
[01:47:14.894 --> 01:47:16.654]  They just feel like it's their family.
[01:47:16.654 --> 01:47:17.354]  It's their club.
[01:47:17.354 --> 01:47:18.215]  They're cool.
[01:47:18.215 --> 01:47:19.755]  Nobody can stop them.
[01:47:19.755 --> 01:47:21.035]  And they're part of the winning team.
[01:47:21.035 --> 01:47:21.636]  Woohoo!
[01:47:21.636 --> 01:47:22.076]  Yeah!
[01:47:22.076 --> 01:47:23.216]  You know, UT Longhorns.
[01:47:23.216 --> 01:47:24.076]  It's the same thing.
[01:47:24.076 --> 01:47:27.037]  It's like you're part of some club.
[01:47:27.037 --> 01:47:32.478]  But you're not in the club.
[01:47:32.478 --> 01:47:36.560]  Antoine in California, thanks for holding your ear on the air.
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:37.800]  Hi, Alex.
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:38.100]  Welcome.
[01:47:39.786 --> 01:47:44.390]  I wanted to get your opinion and shout out to your products.
[01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:47.312]  I'm on the liver shield now.
[01:47:47.312 --> 01:47:52.397]  I just got the knockout and I have some product reviews on the Orbiter YouTube.
[01:47:52.397 --> 01:47:54.778]  But I wanted to get your opinion on Donald Trump.
[01:47:54.778 --> 01:48:01.344]  If any of his staff are listening now, I'd like to say, Ben Carson, Rand Paul, or Ted Cruz, who should be his vice president?
[01:48:01.344 --> 01:48:02.164]  Thank you.
[01:48:02.164 --> 01:48:02.565]  Thank you.
[01:48:02.565 --> 01:48:03.085]  God bless you.
[01:48:03.085 --> 01:48:03.966]  That's a great question.
[01:48:05.501 --> 01:48:09.744]  I would support Trump more if he put a Rand Paul in.
[01:48:09.744 --> 01:48:12.025]  I really like Carson.
[01:48:12.025 --> 01:48:16.028]  But Carson is so good, I can tell he's really a good man.
[01:48:16.028 --> 01:48:22.712]  He's so good that he really believes the state wants to help you and is for forced inoculations.
[01:48:22.712 --> 01:48:23.633]  He just is naive.
[01:48:24.639 --> 01:48:27.820]  He's super smart, but I know people like this.
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:34.143]  He's so good, he wants to help people so much, that he just can't believe the system's corrupt or bad.
[01:48:34.143 --> 01:48:38.204]  I know a lot of Seventh-day Adventists.
[01:48:38.204 --> 01:48:41.426]  They're really smart, loving, hard-working people on average.
[01:48:41.426 --> 01:48:47.168]  Some of the most successful people I know are Seventh-day Adventists, but they still will do whatever the government tells them.
[01:48:47.898 --> 01:48:54.060]  You know, a lot of Seventh-day Adventists were chemically and biologically tested on, and radiologically tested on.
[01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:56.500]  They volunteered for it.
[01:48:56.500 --> 01:49:00.922]  Including, in some cases, to be killed, basically.
[01:49:00.922 --> 01:49:02.502]  Because they thought that was Christ-like.
[01:49:02.502 --> 01:49:09.144]  I mean, I grew up, my mom worked for some of the most prominent Seventh-day Adventists in the country.
[01:49:09.144 --> 01:49:13.405]  Growing up in Dallas, in PR, she wasn't a Seventh-day Adventist.
[01:49:14.941 --> 01:49:18.003]  But they had a national TV show, and they were really nice people.
[01:49:18.003 --> 01:49:21.926]  But man, I tell ya, Nixon used to call up when she was in the office.
[01:49:21.926 --> 01:49:27.549]  She wasn't usually the secretary, but sometimes she'd answer the phone, the secretary was out, and they'd be, the President Nixon's on the line!
[01:49:27.549 --> 01:49:38.816]  So the Seventh-Day Adventists are pretty high-powered, but it's just that... That's my issue with Carson.
[01:49:38.816 --> 01:49:43.419]  I'm not bashing Seventh-Day Adventists, I'm just saying he's too totalitarian.
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:47.261]  He likes low taxes, Christian values.
[01:49:47.261 --> 01:49:53.163]  I really like all that, but you can go too extreme the other way if you then just start saying the state's perfect.
[01:49:53.163 --> 01:49:53.683]  Who'd he say?
[01:49:53.683 --> 01:50:01.566]  He said Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, or Carson.
[01:50:01.566 --> 01:50:04.067]  I like Cruz.
[01:50:04.067 --> 01:50:05.167]  I really do like Cruz.
[01:50:05.167 --> 01:50:08.228]  I mean, he's got some better leadership qualities than Rand Paul.
[01:50:08.228 --> 01:50:11.429]  But I gotta say of the three, I like Rand Paul the best.
[01:50:11.429 --> 01:50:12.770]  But I guess you were asking callers.
[01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:14.650]  What do they think about that?
[01:50:14.650 --> 01:50:15.570]  I think that's a good question.
[01:50:15.570 --> 01:50:17.091]  People want to just throw that in.
[01:50:17.091 --> 01:50:28.559]  But I would trust Trump a lot more if he had a vice president who was somebody like Paul or Cruz.
[01:50:28.559 --> 01:50:30.720]  But I would take Carson.
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:32.402]  I mean, I think Carson is a good man.
[01:50:32.402 --> 01:50:33.302]  He can be educated.
[01:50:33.302 --> 01:50:35.504]  He's not on a power trip.
[01:50:35.504 --> 01:50:37.065]  You can really tell he's a humble man.
[01:50:38.664 --> 01:50:45.870]  I have a good feeling about Carson, and I just have to be honest with people, that I really don't like some of the stuff he stands for, but I have a good feeling about him.
[01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:48.632]  But, if he's naive, he can be manipulated.
[01:50:48.632 --> 01:50:54.637]  Ted Cruz, I really like how he talks, now he acts, but I got this gut feeling that he's a little too slick.
[01:50:54.637 --> 01:50:55.918]  Rand Paul, love him.
[01:50:55.918 --> 01:50:57.499]  I'm afraid he listens too much to his advisors.
[01:50:57.499 --> 01:50:58.400]  I mean, there's where I stand.
[01:51:00.555 --> 01:51:02.377]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowicz.
[01:51:02.377 --> 01:51:04.900]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:08.784]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing.
[01:51:08.784 --> 01:51:17.594]  Ten years ago, I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[01:51:17.594 --> 01:51:20.877]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[01:51:21.738 --> 01:51:24.880]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S.
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:30.244]  passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[01:51:30.244 --> 01:51:35.167]  It was then I formed IDStronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world.
[01:51:35.167 --> 01:51:38.329]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[01:51:38.329 --> 01:51:41.411]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[01:51:41.411 --> 01:51:47.656]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallets, sleeves, or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data.
[01:51:48.436 --> 01:51:54.047]  You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct sales model you won't pay more than other comparable unprotected wallets.
[01:51:54.047 --> 01:51:56.431]  It is as though the protection is free.

[01:54:02.688 --> 01:54:11.453]  Man, it is hard not to listen to Chuck Berry.
[01:54:11.453 --> 01:54:13.614]  Let's crank it up for a moment.
[01:54:27.989 --> 01:54:34.931]  That's the real granddaddy of rock and roll right there.
[01:54:34.931 --> 01:54:38.311]  That's not hard to listen to.
[01:54:38.311 --> 01:54:46.333]  Man, that's good stuff.
[01:54:46.333 --> 01:54:48.633]  Johnny be good.
[01:54:48.633 --> 01:54:51.914]  And that's the beautiful stuff that comes out of the human spirit.
[01:54:51.914 --> 01:54:55.415]  And the globalists want to just tell us how ugly we are, how bad we are.
[01:54:55.415 --> 01:54:56.275]  It's all a fraud.
[01:54:57.281 --> 01:55:00.503]  We have to believe in ourselves, we have to believe in God, we have to believe in our families.
[01:55:00.503 --> 01:55:06.248]  We have to understand everything the globalists push, we should support the opposite.
[01:55:06.248 --> 01:55:11.772]  We're going to be going back to your calls here in just a moment.
[01:55:11.772 --> 01:55:14.654]  There's a new video out, it's on Infowars.com.
[01:55:14.654 --> 01:55:18.517]  Hillary supporters think a white privilege tax is a good idea.
[01:55:18.517 --> 01:55:21.999]  We've got to help each other out.
[01:55:21.999 --> 01:55:26.383]  We're going to be getting into the details of CNN turns mixed-race organ shooter into a white man.
[01:55:27.796 --> 01:55:32.480]  The new national police force run by the UN to go after patriots?
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:36.684]  That's mainstream news.
[01:55:36.684 --> 01:55:37.985]  People go, oh, they're not going to do that.
[01:55:37.985 --> 01:55:38.866]  They're going to try.
[01:55:38.866 --> 01:55:42.309]  I mean, these people mean business.
[01:55:42.309 --> 01:55:46.433]  And I say more power to them, it's just going to blow up in their face politically.
[01:55:46.433 --> 01:55:48.474]  People are really, really, really waking up to this.
[01:55:48.474 --> 01:55:51.657]  And a bunch of other news I haven't gotten to yet that's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:55:55.572 --> 01:55:56.533]  There's a new video out.
[01:55:56.533 --> 01:56:00.536]  Migrant complains about lack of sex in refugee camp.
[01:56:00.536 --> 01:56:05.080]  Chancellor Merkel, Lord God, sent illegal immigrants.
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:10.984]  EU Cardinal says that Merkel is Lord God.
[01:56:10.984 --> 01:56:16.489]  Like the Pope came in Philadelphia and said, I come to speak for as me, myself.
[01:56:16.489 --> 01:56:18.511]  It's like the opposite of what the Bible says.
[01:56:18.511 --> 01:56:20.312]  I come to speak, you know, for the Christians.
[01:56:20.312 --> 01:56:22.113]  I come to speak as myself.
[01:56:22.113 --> 01:56:22.554]  Video.
[01:56:22.554 --> 01:56:24.195]  Hillary supporters think white privilege tax.
[01:56:24.195 --> 01:56:24.776]  There's that article.
[01:56:25.663 --> 01:56:28.025]  Feminists now urinate on themselves to battle men.
[01:56:28.025 --> 01:56:28.625]  I'm not kidding.
[01:56:28.625 --> 01:56:30.447]  That's a new article.
[01:56:30.447 --> 01:56:34.450]  Trans-Pacific Partnership deal reached.
[01:56:34.450 --> 01:56:39.334]  Lesbian Swedish Bishop wants Christian crosses removed from church to please Muslims.
[01:56:39.334 --> 01:56:41.055]  He can't make this up.
[01:56:41.055 --> 01:56:42.776]  Doctors Without Borders says U.S.
[01:56:42.776 --> 01:56:45.598]  airstrike hit hospital in Afghanistan.
[01:56:45.598 --> 01:56:50.462]  James Wood says hate crime massacre of Christians finally silences Obama.
[01:56:50.462 --> 01:56:52.444]  I want to continue with your calls just briefly.
[01:56:53.837 --> 01:57:00.823]  Prostagard, I believe, is one of the most powerful, affordable prostate formulas out there.
[01:57:00.823 --> 01:57:08.449]  And even the government, you can look this up, admits that Saint Paul Meadow has been proven to help the prostate and overall health and function.
[01:57:08.449 --> 01:57:12.332]  Such an important move on so many fronts.
[01:57:12.332 --> 01:57:13.613]  It's only $15.96 right now.
[01:57:13.613 --> 01:57:15.054]  That's 20% off.
[01:57:15.054 --> 01:57:15.735]  Folks, at $20, it's already
[01:57:21.354 --> 01:57:21.795]  Over the top.
[01:57:21.795 --> 01:57:25.200]  I mean, a bottle of Saw Palmetto from a leading competitor is over $29.
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:31.369]  They've got other multi formulas that have got the same stuff we've got that are $35, $40.
[01:57:31.369 --> 01:57:35.976]  So, this is the same dose or more than leading competitors with everything in it from L-Tryptophan.
[01:57:37.978 --> 01:57:39.839]  Well, the alternative fan's in the knockout.
[01:57:39.839 --> 01:57:42.702]  Let me go over all the listings things, the things that are in it.
[01:57:42.702 --> 01:57:49.407]  The salt palmetto, lycopene, that's the key, plant sterols, zinc, vitamin D3, selenium, copper, and more.
[01:57:49.407 --> 01:57:52.569]  It's available at infowarslife.com, 20% off right now.

[01:57:58.353 --> 01:58:00.375]  And we've got that while supplies last.
[01:58:00.375 --> 01:58:01.996]  We've got plenty of it, so it should last.
[01:58:02.296 --> 01:58:14.402]  What is going to run out, we think, in about two to three days, is Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2, the big game changer, the good halogen in the body that has just done incredible things in my life.
[01:58:14.402 --> 01:58:22.946]  You've heard the Ray Reviews on air, you can read the reviews or the testimonials, what people have to say, at Infowarslife.com, a third-party site we link to.

[01:59:20.154 --> 01:59:22.355]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:59:22.355 --> 01:59:27.356]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:59:27.356 --> 01:59:30.636]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:59:30.636 --> 01:59:34.117]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:59:34.117 --> 01:59:36.097]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:59:36.097 --> 01:59:38.198]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:59:38.198 --> 01:59:40.218]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:59:40.218 --> 01:59:45.799]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:59:51.196 --> 01:59:53.812]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:10.113]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.113 --> 02:00:11.694]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.694 --> 02:00:13.235]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.235 --> 02:00:17.438]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.438 --> 02:00:21.480]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.580 --> 02:00:31.825]  I was intending at the start of the next segment to get into deal reached on Pacific Rim Trade Pact.
[02:00:31.825 --> 02:00:33.207]  That's the Washington Post.
[02:00:33.207 --> 02:00:37.191]  But we've got callers who want to talk about it now, so I'm going to go to George in Connecticut here in just a moment.
[02:00:37.191 --> 02:00:41.114]  But I will detail it more at the start of the next segment.
[02:00:41.114 --> 02:00:43.036]  Everything about this is a deception.
[02:00:43.036 --> 02:00:45.298]  Mainstream media just always calls it a trade pact.
[02:00:45.298 --> 02:00:48.762]  It's global government, multinational treaty, being ratified in secret.
[02:00:50.011 --> 02:00:59.821]  So they're getting it agreed to by all the major corporations and independent governments, the central governments, without the congresses or legislatures or parliaments involved.
[02:00:59.821 --> 02:01:14.655]  Then, they're moving it next month, or two and a half months from now, in December, to Paris to officially ratify it at the UN, to get an agreement.
[02:01:17.265 --> 02:01:18.646]  And we're not allowed to see it.
[02:01:18.646 --> 02:01:21.447]  I mean, need I say more?
[02:01:21.447 --> 02:01:23.127]  Need I say more?
[02:01:23.127 --> 02:01:38.494]  It just shows the total totalitarian, command-and-control, authoritarian, tyrannical, oppressive, secretive, star-chamber nature of what's being established right now.
[02:01:38.494 --> 02:01:43.676]  But college kids are too busy learning about how to pour Drano in their eyes to be blind and trans-abled.
[02:01:44.605 --> 02:01:47.788]  That's what's taught at UT in the psychology department.
[02:01:47.788 --> 02:01:51.651]  About all the weirdnesses and how people have a right to it and how we should pay for it.
[02:01:51.651 --> 02:01:57.156]  I mean, this is just what goes on in America and worldwide now.
[02:01:57.156 --> 02:02:00.259]  Because it's an enemy takeover.
[02:02:00.259 --> 02:02:02.841]  Georgia and Connecticut on the TPP.
[02:02:02.841 --> 02:02:03.442]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:02:03.442 --> 02:02:03.742]  Welcome.
[02:02:04.761 --> 02:02:17.328]  Yeah, I think we should line up a lot of good speakers on that and see if we can get everybody to constantly bombard their legislatures and senators and congressmen to stop this in its track.
[02:02:17.328 --> 02:02:22.571]  Make them realize that we don't want this unless there's a referendum where the people can actually vote on this.
[02:02:22.571 --> 02:02:28.434]  Forget about the traitor politicians who vote everything against the people's will anymore.
[02:02:28.434 --> 02:02:30.976]  That's right, they've never voted down a trade authority, ever.
[02:02:31.596 --> 02:02:35.582]  And so what they gave the president was fast track, but they said, don't worry, we'll now review it.
[02:02:35.582 --> 02:02:41.692]  But they still can't see it, other than senior members for one hour in a locked room, with no photography.
[02:02:41.692 --> 02:02:42.974]  I mean, this is crazy!
[02:02:45.005 --> 02:02:57.957]  The type of people we should be lining up is Pat Buchanan, Nader, because I just saw him up at, what is it, your economic guy, Silente.
[02:02:57.957 --> 02:02:59.839]  He had a peace demonstration up there.
[02:02:59.839 --> 02:03:00.700]  He's against this.
[02:03:00.700 --> 02:03:02.041]  He has a big website on that.
[02:03:02.581 --> 02:03:12.709]  Virtually, left to right, the people, if you align these people up... That's right, left to right, it is the most unpopular issue, it's like 87% of Americans, 89% don't like it.
[02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:18.173]  So it's all secret, because it's illegal, it's secret, it's pure bull, it's unconstitutional.
[02:03:18.173 --> 02:03:22.617]  So, the government's almost unanimous, because we're almost unanimous against it.
[02:03:22.617 --> 02:03:26.360]  It's called a power grab, it's called a takeover, it's called epic.
[02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:31.404]  I mean, it just shows how flamingly authoritarian these scumbags are.
[02:03:33.397 --> 02:03:48.986]  I think we should make it clear that we're going to pass legislative laws in the states to call them out and make them prisoners and basically jail these sons of bitches if they keep passing these types of laws that are totally against the people's will.
[02:03:48.986 --> 02:03:50.567]  I think that's what we call this piece.
[02:03:50.567 --> 02:03:52.328]  Jail the TPP sons of bitches.
[02:03:53.487 --> 02:04:05.180]  I'm going to be honest, insulting women who had kids on a wedlock, I'm not saying it's a great thing, but these guys are beyond bastard sons of bitches.
[02:04:05.180 --> 02:04:07.582]  Right, right.
[02:04:07.582 --> 02:04:10.485]  We lose terminology for these type of people.
[02:04:10.485 --> 02:04:14.370]  I mean, they're beyond the scope of the imagination even of our ancestors.
[02:04:15.168 --> 02:04:22.832]  They are so traitorous because we produce so much wealth, the world's so complex, criminals can hide in the complexity.
[02:04:22.832 --> 02:04:31.077]  But now the crime has gotten so big, there's this complexity sitting in front of it, but the crime's 20 times bigger, so the complexity doesn't hide it anymore.
[02:04:31.077 --> 02:04:35.799]  We're just looking at it, and it's gotten so arrogant, so crazy, so wild.
[02:04:35.799 --> 02:04:43.624]  You know, I mean, like I said earlier, Pepsi has baby flavoring, body parts sales, they're keeping prisoners alive and harvesting their organs piece by piece in China.
[02:04:44.384 --> 02:04:47.409]  You know, they're trying to teach our five-year-olds how to masturbate in school.
[02:04:47.409 --> 02:04:49.772]  I mean, it's just like, stop it!
[02:04:49.772 --> 02:04:51.455]  Stop it, you crazy people!
[02:04:51.455 --> 02:04:53.698]  Pouring bleach in their eyes on television.
[02:04:53.698 --> 02:04:54.860]  How wonderful it all is.
[02:04:54.860 --> 02:04:56.422]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:04:56.422 --> 02:04:56.903]  We'll be back.
[02:04:56.903 --> 02:04:57.343]  Stay with us.
[02:04:59.332 --> 02:05:01.492]  Kit Daniels, InfoWurst.com.
[02:05:01.492 --> 02:05:06.233]  CNN reportedly altered the photo of the biracial organ shooter to make him look more white.
[02:05:06.233 --> 02:05:08.894]  That's a shocking revelation, so let me repeat that.
[02:05:08.894 --> 02:05:14.635]  CNN apparently doctored the photo of the biracial organ shooter, Christopher Mercer, to make people think he's Caucasian.
[02:05:14.635 --> 02:05:23.397]  Mercer uploaded a selfie to social media, but when CNN used the photo in its news broadcast, Mercer's skin tone had dramatically changed to that of a white man.
[02:05:23.397 --> 02:05:27.678]  Furthermore, CNN did not show photos of Mercer's mother, who's African-American.
[02:05:27.898 --> 02:05:33.921]  And the network also didn't report that Mercer was involved in a school play, which contradicts the media's claim that he was a loner.
[02:05:33.921 --> 02:05:34.961]  Why would they do that?
[02:05:34.961 --> 02:05:41.304]  Because a biracial Oregon shooter does not fit into the establishment's propaganda that mass shooters are white racist men.
[02:05:41.304 --> 02:05:48.648]  They also don't want you to know that Mercer was associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, because it would be a political nightmare for Obama if the public knew the truth.
[02:05:48.908 --> 02:05:55.530]  It'd be hard for him to demand more gun control if more people started to realize that President Obama is fueling racial division across the U.S.
[02:05:55.530 --> 02:05:59.112]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:05:59.112 --> 02:06:00.032]  Alex Jones here.
[02:06:00.032 --> 02:06:16.578]  InfoWarsStore.com is now partnering with the top-of-the-line storable food company, My Patriot Supply, to bring you the highest quality, freshest, longest-lasting, most affordable storable foods, private-labeled, from InfoWarsSelect.com at the lowest price you're going to find anywhere.

[02:06:18.439 --> 02:06:20.040]  We need to be self-sufficient.
[02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:25.384]  And if you don't have high-quality, long-lasting, storable foods, I believe you're making a huge mistake.

[02:07:04.616 --> 02:07:04.996]  I don't know.
[02:07:33.117 --> 02:07:38.721]  You're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[02:07:38.721 --> 02:07:42.023]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[02:07:42.023 --> 02:07:46.226]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[02:07:46.226 --> 02:07:48.528]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[02:07:48.528 --> 02:07:55.493]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:08:03.155 --> 02:08:05.576]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:08:05.576 --> 02:08:08.777]  It is time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:08.777 --> 02:08:12.659]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:12.659 --> 02:08:24.384]  This magic moment So different and so new Wasn't like any other Until I kissed you And then
[02:08:29.930 --> 02:08:38.536]  Well, here's the headline, ladies and gentlemen, as we enter the third hour.
[02:08:52.615 --> 02:08:57.496]  Delta Force considered staging fake hijacking after 9-11.
[02:08:57.496 --> 02:09:19.782]  I want to get into the story because it ties into a lot of other issues and then I'm going to get back into the TPP being agreed to in secret by major corporations and governments but still the American people and other nations populations are not allowed to see the secret global treaties that are not trade deals that are global government.
[02:09:20.765 --> 02:09:22.666]  So that's all coming up.
[02:09:22.666 --> 02:09:29.409]  But first off, Delta Force considered staging fake hijacking after 9-11.
[02:09:29.409 --> 02:09:32.590]  Now, why is this so important?
[02:09:32.590 --> 02:09:47.216]  Even though we're 14 years after 9-11, you can go pull up my films, Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, and such, and you can see all the news articles and video clips from mainstream news, even in those films, and you can even search the web and go to the Google
[02:09:48.729 --> 02:10:15.983]  Archive and find ABC News, USA Today, and even CNN admitting that the Pentagon staged dozens of drills, the CIA multiple drills, where hijackers tried to hijack American and United aircraft in the two years before 9-11 in simulated drills.
[02:10:18.052 --> 02:10:29.642]  Now that's a big deal, because on the morning of 9-11 they were running drills of hijackers trying to take over aircraft, but the specific details of that remain classified.
[02:10:29.642 --> 02:10:34.005]  That's even in the New York Times.
[02:10:34.005 --> 02:10:41.312]  And we know that Mohammed Adda and the other supposed 19 hijackers, 15 of them that came from Saudi Arabia, we know
[02:10:42.714 --> 02:10:47.137]  That those very individuals were at the Defense Language School.
[02:10:47.137 --> 02:10:52.741]  Colonel Butler, the head of the school, went public and said, I don't know what's going on, but three of these guys were trained here.
[02:10:52.741 --> 02:10:55.563]  One of them was in my class just a few years ago.
[02:10:55.563 --> 02:10:56.764]  Something's happening.
[02:10:56.764 --> 02:10:59.746]  We know they had passports and they were allowed to travel in and out of the country.
[02:10:59.746 --> 02:11:04.409]  I've had the former head of the visa section from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on, Springman.
[02:11:04.409 --> 02:11:08.972]  They were ordered to let these guys into the country, even though they were flagged as terrorists and were told they're working with the CIA.
[02:11:10.717 --> 02:11:18.400]  So you leap forward to Christmas a few years ago, what, four or five years ago, with the underwear bomber.
[02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:21.801]  Muttalib, his dad's this top ambassador.
[02:11:21.801 --> 02:11:24.702]  He is clearly drugged on the plane, witnesses see it.
[02:11:24.702 --> 02:11:25.682]  Someone from the U.S.
[02:11:25.682 --> 02:11:28.163]  government in Amsterdam orders them to let him on the plane.
[02:11:29.144 --> 02:11:30.106]  He then stands up.
[02:11:30.106 --> 02:11:31.548]  A man gets up and starts videotaping.
[02:11:31.548 --> 02:11:32.570]  It's all staged.
[02:11:32.570 --> 02:11:34.594]  A firecracker goes off in his pants.
[02:11:34.594 --> 02:11:40.384]  They then use that as a way to bring in the naked body scanners and more security against the American people themselves.
[02:11:42.964 --> 02:11:45.226]  Well now we have the New York Post.
[02:11:45.226 --> 02:11:57.255]  Delta Force considered staging fake hijacking after 9-11 as a false flag to tell the public Delta Force was on all the planes as pure security theater.
[02:11:57.255 --> 02:12:01.219]  This is admitted now.
[02:12:01.219 --> 02:12:03.961]  To scare people from ever hijacking planes.
[02:12:03.961 --> 02:12:06.523]  Now that's the cover story because I know this is coming out.
[02:12:07.757 --> 02:12:19.744]  No, it was gonna be done so they could sell more security and put real military on all the aircraft and get the army involved, not just the air marshals.
[02:12:19.744 --> 02:12:26.989]  And I know about this because I was told this by someone in the federal government back in 2003.
[02:12:26.989 --> 02:12:29.951]  Now, let's go further.
[02:12:29.951 --> 02:12:33.713]  Delta Force, and I'll never forget Esquire was here,
[02:12:36.195 --> 02:12:38.016]  I don't know, like two years ago doing a cover story.
[02:12:38.016 --> 02:12:40.618]  You can go read it.
[02:12:40.618 --> 02:12:43.801]  And this guy's dad was the CIA section chief.
[02:12:43.801 --> 02:12:45.502]  He's the top profiler in the country.
[02:12:47.062 --> 02:12:51.726]  He shows up, he goes, I agree with some of what you say, but not a lot of it, and I'm gonna prove you wrong on this stuff.
[02:12:51.726 --> 02:12:55.368]  He goes, there was no Delta Force running the Seattle thing.
[02:12:55.368 --> 02:12:57.650]  I was there, they didn't stage the riots.
[02:12:57.650 --> 02:13:03.855]  And I went, here's four newspapers, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Seattle Times, and two others, all admitting it.
[02:13:03.855 --> 02:13:06.777]  He went, oh my God, I was there and didn't know this.
[02:13:06.777 --> 02:13:09.039]  I go, here's the police chief, came on my show and talked about it.
[02:13:09.039 --> 02:13:10.039]  Here's a film I made.
[02:13:10.039 --> 02:13:12.681]  And he went, oh my God, I can't believe this is true.
[02:13:12.681 --> 02:13:15.844]  Then he started checking everything I was saying and found out, basically, it was all true.
[02:13:18.749 --> 02:13:21.351]  It was going to be probably a cover story.
[02:13:21.351 --> 02:13:27.154]  He goes, they're not even going to publish it now, maybe, I mean, because I'm not attacking you basically enough.
[02:13:27.154 --> 02:13:34.379]  But he was so prestigious, he does all the Tom Cruise interviews, all of them, that basically they published the article.
[02:13:34.379 --> 02:13:35.460]  They published the article.
[02:13:37.185 --> 02:13:39.146]  But I got a call from Esquire.
[02:13:39.146 --> 02:13:41.807]  They said, look, we want you to do one of those wild man poses you do.
[02:13:41.807 --> 02:13:42.948]  We need to balance this out.
[02:13:42.948 --> 02:13:48.730]  This is too... At least they were honest when the photographer came and I said, OK, I'll do a monster face for you.
[02:13:48.730 --> 02:13:49.871]  And you call that selling out.
[02:13:49.871 --> 02:13:50.331]  It's not.
[02:13:50.331 --> 02:13:52.272]  I played ball because it's a waste.
[02:13:52.272 --> 02:13:54.513]  I've had to not do other big stories.
[02:13:54.513 --> 02:13:57.034]  And I knew that just bring people into the show anyways.
[02:13:57.034 --> 02:14:01.116]  So I, you know, did a, you know, war growl face.
[02:14:01.116 --> 02:14:02.476]  I mean, I really do that anyway.
[02:14:02.476 --> 02:14:03.297]  So why not do it?
[02:14:04.568 --> 02:14:06.591]  It's an aspect of who I am.
[02:14:06.591 --> 02:14:12.478]  And they stuck it at the very back of the magazine.
[02:14:12.478 --> 02:14:16.543]  The very back of the magazine.
[02:14:16.543 --> 02:14:22.390]  But that guy had enough power to where he could basically threaten to get really upset and talk about it.
[02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:23.051]  They didn't put it in there.
[02:14:24.178 --> 02:14:31.641]  When it was the Wall Street Journal, or the New York Times, or the Washington Post, you know what happens when they want to do a profile now?
[02:14:31.641 --> 02:14:33.702]  Or Atlantic Monthly?
[02:14:33.702 --> 02:14:40.344]  I go, you won't be allowed to publish your piece if it's not a complete deceptive piece of garbage.
[02:14:40.344 --> 02:14:50.688]  And they come here, they do the piece, and they go, oh my gosh, in my 10 years, my 30 years, my 40 years, I've never seen them do this on a story.
[02:14:50.688 --> 02:14:52.109]  They're not going to publish it.
[02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:58.495]  They shot a five-part series, the highest budget ever for Discovery Channel that I was in.
[02:14:58.495 --> 02:15:03.000]  I spent months in like 2006 shooting it.
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:04.541]  With the, what's his name, Bulger?
[02:15:04.541 --> 02:15:05.242]  Belger guy?
[02:15:05.242 --> 02:15:07.685]  He's won like, you know, top awards.
[02:15:07.685 --> 02:15:10.828]  Made Brother's Keeper, all that, some kind of monster with Metallica.
[02:15:10.828 --> 02:15:11.909]  He's been on the show.
[02:15:11.909 --> 02:15:13.430]  Really nice guy.
[02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:14.692]  He didn't make me look like a kook.
[02:15:14.692 --> 02:15:16.253]  I mean, there was some stuff where I was goofy.
[02:15:16.253 --> 02:15:16.694]  I am goofy.
[02:15:19.027 --> 02:15:24.249]  He came to me and he said, will you be willing to let some Fox News people reshoot some of this?
[02:15:24.249 --> 02:15:25.490]  Because, well, Fox News wasn't involved.
[02:15:25.490 --> 02:15:27.050]  That's what they wanted to counter me.
[02:15:27.050 --> 02:15:30.451]  And to battle some pundants to add to this.
[02:15:30.451 --> 02:15:32.552]  And I said, because they say it's too one-sided.
[02:15:32.552 --> 02:15:33.752]  And I said, sure.
[02:15:33.752 --> 02:15:34.613]  He comes back a week later.
[02:15:34.613 --> 02:15:35.293]  He goes, you know what?
[02:15:35.293 --> 02:15:36.153]  I have integrity.
[02:15:36.153 --> 02:15:40.695]  I'm not doing it.
[02:15:40.695 --> 02:15:46.197]  And so the whole piece was shelved and they killed it because he wouldn't re-edit it and turn it into a fraud.
[02:15:48.522 --> 02:16:02.269]  So, if people want to know about control out there, they sent Homeland Security that I'm not even supposed to get into this because I was told all of this in confidence, but I don't think it's really right that people don't know about this.
[02:16:02.269 --> 02:16:12.694]  Let me tell you this, there was a lot more went on to kill Jesse Ventura's FEMA show that I basically wrote, and that one piece, that was like 80% Alex Jones.
[02:16:14.076 --> 02:16:20.942]  They aired one time, folks, those congressional hearings on everything, because it was so accurate.
[02:16:20.942 --> 02:16:23.224]  There's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes people don't even know about.
[02:16:23.224 --> 02:16:26.907]  Let me tell you, this government wants to take over.
[02:16:26.907 --> 02:16:28.669]  It wants to shut this show down.
[02:16:28.669 --> 02:16:30.250]  It wants to arrest people.
[02:16:30.250 --> 02:16:32.612]  It's evil.
[02:16:32.612 --> 02:16:36.856]  And so, that's the rest of the story on all of this.
[02:16:39.384 --> 02:16:43.989]  And this is now leaking about the Delta Force doing all this.
[02:16:43.989 --> 02:16:48.073]  The rest of the story about Seattle.
[02:16:48.073 --> 02:16:51.777]  I've gone up against Navy SEALs and Delta Force.
[02:16:51.777 --> 02:16:55.481]  And I didn't know what was going on when this was all first happening.
[02:16:55.481 --> 02:16:59.345]  Setting fires and trying to blame me.
[02:16:59.345 --> 02:17:00.986]  Taking our video at gunpoint.
[02:17:04.056 --> 02:17:20.361]  I mean, in the old days under Clinton, folks, if I tried to go to an urban warfare drill in a major city and try to cover it, they'd break in on our hotel rooms, they'd sabotage our cars, they'd put something in my drink, give me a migraine headache for 12 hours.
[02:17:24.918 --> 02:17:26.679]  And it was just funny to them.
[02:17:26.679 --> 02:17:29.601]  And you'd be like, oh, the Navy SEALs are wonderful, the Delta Force are great.
[02:17:29.601 --> 02:17:31.503]  There are a lot of great people in there.
[02:17:31.503 --> 02:17:42.691]  But I'm telling you, the ones that work directly under the President, whatever, they call them squadrons, they're involved in murdering people domestically, shipping drugs in, renditions, I mean,
[02:17:43.837 --> 02:17:48.698]  They take some of the best people in the country and they just test them and test them until they'll do anything.
[02:17:48.698 --> 02:17:57.140]  And they put them on drugs, they put them on steroids, they put them on growth hormone, they put them on all sorts of weird stuff, and they just completely whack them out of their minds.
[02:17:57.140 --> 02:18:05.342]  And I wouldn't be surprised if this was being put out because they were going to set Delta Force up or something and have them do some hijackings.
[02:18:05.342 --> 02:18:10.404]  I mean, even at the end of one day in September, they got an Academy Award that came out like in 2003.
[02:18:12.847 --> 02:18:17.932]  About the Munich situation with the Munich Olympic Games back in the 70s.
[02:18:17.932 --> 02:18:26.380]  They admit that just at the end that, oh, the Germans staged a hijacking to release the terrorists because it turned out they'd been working for them the whole time.
[02:18:26.380 --> 02:18:29.583]  That whole thing was staged at the Munich Olympics.
[02:18:29.583 --> 02:18:31.805]  And they just admit at the end of it, it's all fake!
[02:18:36.613 --> 02:18:51.202]  But they did something else now in the last five years with IS, which was the payoff to Saudi Arabia, who from 1901 to 1933 was given the entire Middle East from nothing by British intelligence.
[02:18:51.202 --> 02:18:55.424]  They didn't even have Saudi Arabia.
[02:18:55.424 --> 02:19:00.768]  They now created a real army and have turned them loose and protected them and have given them missiles
[02:19:01.886 --> 02:19:11.549]  Anti-aircraft missiles and have them inside the United States.
[02:19:11.549 --> 02:19:23.172]  Ready to start shooting down jet airliners, pumping chlorine gas down high-rises, burning up bridges, blowing things up, attacking police departments.
[02:19:23.172 --> 02:19:24.932]  All hell's gonna break loose.
[02:19:24.932 --> 02:19:26.812]  And you think, well logically they'll just say arm the people.
[02:19:26.812 --> 02:19:28.653]  No, they're gonna say take our guns when it happens.
[02:19:30.404 --> 02:19:32.145]  I mean, I can really see what they're getting set up.
[02:19:32.145 --> 02:19:40.111]  We're going to go to Christopher, Corey, Rex, Dean, Matthew, and others straight ahead.
[02:19:40.111 --> 02:19:43.273]  But I told you I would get into the rest of the story on that.
[02:19:43.273 --> 02:19:45.014]  But man, this government's evil.
[02:19:45.014 --> 02:19:52.019]  The people running this government have it out for you and your family.
[02:19:52.019 --> 02:19:54.501]  They want to have a civil war where we fight the general government.
[02:19:54.501 --> 02:19:55.882]  The general government's like the public.
[02:19:56.702 --> 02:19:57.962]  They don't know what's going on.
[02:19:57.962 --> 02:20:02.384]  I mean, compared to the public they do, but... We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day.
[02:20:02.384 --> 02:20:09.026]  But growing scientific evidence has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.

[02:21:58.968 --> 02:22:02.510]  Young people are supposed to be full of energy and recover quickly from exercise.
[02:22:02.510 --> 02:22:06.112]  Their age should give them a great advantage to feeling good all the time.
[02:22:06.112 --> 02:22:12.035]  However, young people of today are dealing with the same nutrient-deficient food as everyone else in America.
[02:22:12.035 --> 02:22:14.156]  So it does not matter whether you are 15 or 85.
[02:22:14.156 --> 02:22:17.858]  If your biochemistry is off, you cannot feel your best.
[02:22:17.858 --> 02:22:20.439]  Listen to the real-world results of James.

[02:22:23.280 --> 02:22:26.242]  At the end of a tiring work shift, I used to not do much around the house.
[02:22:26.482 --> 02:22:36.845]  Since I started taking the new Technology Enhance One World Way after work, I have so much energy when I get home that I'm able to take long walks, do chores, and even honey to-do lists from the wife.
[02:22:36.845 --> 02:22:41.547]  It's plenty enough energy to get things done around the house and time to settle down before bedtime.

[02:24:00.706 --> 02:24:02.868]  All the leaves are brown.
[02:24:02.868 --> 02:24:06.211]  And the sky is gray.
[02:24:10.945 --> 02:24:12.826]  Paul Watson will host the fourth hour.
[02:24:12.826 --> 02:24:16.309]  Again, three hours of the Alex Jones Show, and then a fourth hour of Overdrive.
[02:24:16.309 --> 02:24:20.972]  I host it sometimes, where we rotate through the different hosts and different reporters.
[02:24:20.972 --> 02:24:40.565]  And Paul's going to be getting more into the new identity politics of cutting your arms and legs off, or your genitals off, or gouging your eyeballs out, or pouring Drano in them, or having all your teeth ripped out with pliers, or other sickening demonic things, all part of mainlining mental illness, and saying, you've got to accept it, and maybe your eyes should be gouged out.
[02:24:42.213 --> 02:24:44.656]  So should I do a satire piece where I pour Drano in my eyes?
[02:24:44.656 --> 02:24:46.899]  I mean, not real Drano?
[02:24:46.899 --> 02:24:49.622]  And then just roll around the ground going, I'm trendy, I'm more trendy than you?
[02:24:49.622 --> 02:24:51.504]  And maybe that's the answer.
[02:24:51.504 --> 02:24:53.767]  Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't want to pour Drano in my eyes.
[02:24:55.640 --> 02:24:56.901]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:24:56.901 --> 02:25:02.825]  I'll get more into TPP, more on the new National Police Force run by the UN to target extremist veterans gun owners.
[02:25:02.825 --> 02:25:04.946]  That's mainstream news, can't make it up.
[02:25:04.946 --> 02:25:06.427]  But right now, let's continue with the calls.
[02:25:06.427 --> 02:25:09.449]  We're doing a pretty good job here on the Ring of Dangers today.
[02:25:09.449 --> 02:25:11.190]  Let's go to Christopher in North Dakota.
[02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:13.491]  You're on The Year Worldwide.
[02:25:13.491 --> 02:25:16.914]  Hey Alex, thanks for everything you do.
[02:25:16.914 --> 02:25:17.234]  Thank you.
[02:25:17.234 --> 02:25:18.214]  Can I ask you a question, sir?
[02:25:18.214 --> 02:25:18.935]  Do you have eyes?
[02:25:20.643 --> 02:25:20.763]  Yeah.
[02:25:20.763 --> 02:25:24.526]  Man, you know, I've thought about it, but I like to be able to see in the gifts that God has blessed me with.
[02:25:51.403 --> 02:25:52.044]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:25:52.044 --> 02:25:53.807]  He's trying to keep me blind, that's for sure.
[02:26:04.073 --> 02:26:05.535]  Hey, no worries.
[02:26:05.535 --> 02:26:09.699]  So I just have a point and a couple of factoids to help base it.
[02:26:09.699 --> 02:26:19.309]  But, you know, with this gun control they're calling for, let's take it back down to the public schools, which our government is teaching our children.
[02:26:19.309 --> 02:26:22.252]  You mean the government training centers?
[02:26:22.252 --> 02:26:22.952]  Yes, exactly.
[02:26:22.952 --> 02:26:24.634]  The ones that say the kids belong to them?
[02:26:24.634 --> 02:26:26.096]  What about those wonderful places?
[02:26:27.594 --> 02:26:39.941]  So, if your child skips school or misses too much school, who is the one that's called to court and made to pay the fines and possibly sentenced to jail for skipping school?
[02:26:39.941 --> 02:26:40.962]  Mommy and Daddy!
[02:26:40.962 --> 02:26:42.282]  That is correct.
[02:26:42.282 --> 02:26:50.887]  So, when it comes all down to it, if your child has gone out and committed a mass murder,
[02:26:52.287 --> 02:26:58.912]  Basically, you as a parent have failed to teach your child humanity and respect for all forms of life.
[02:26:58.912 --> 02:27:02.795]  You know, but the government will not allow you to discipline your child.
[02:27:02.795 --> 02:27:08.219]  And if you try to take your child to get a second opinion for their health, they're going to send CPS to come get them.
[02:27:08.219 --> 02:27:16.786]  Yeah, this is another guy that lived in his mother's basement with the Oregon shooting who hated Christians, who was biracial.
[02:27:16.786 --> 02:27:21.950]  Have you seen the photo of how CNN made his nose, lips smaller and then turned him white?
[02:27:23.123 --> 02:27:24.786]  Oh yes, I've seen that picture.
[02:27:24.786 --> 02:27:29.555]  I mean, this just shows the sickening level of deception on these people.
[02:27:29.555 --> 02:27:30.597]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:27:30.597 --> 02:27:33.403]  And if your child has one little flaw, they're going to push.
[02:27:34.082 --> 02:27:37.183]  Government-made methamphetamine on them.
[02:27:37.183 --> 02:27:46.507]  If your child is on Adderall or Adderall, however you want to pronounce it, you better look at the ingredient label because 99% of it is methamphetamine salt.
[02:27:46.507 --> 02:27:47.727]  Well, exactly.
[02:27:47.727 --> 02:27:56.090]  Your kids are going to be bouncing off the walls the first month, but then they are going to get calm when they burn out and their brain mass shrinks and rotholes form in the brain.
[02:27:56.090 --> 02:27:57.151]  They've got all these adults
[02:27:57.771 --> 02:27:58.491]  You name it.
[02:27:58.491 --> 02:28:02.553]  I think every maid service I've run into, I look in their eyes, their faces, they're all on speed.
[02:28:02.553 --> 02:28:06.134]  I feel sorry for these people because they're going to end up burning out.
[02:28:06.134 --> 02:28:09.516]  Slower than they would if it was street meth, but absolutely.
[02:28:09.516 --> 02:28:13.457]  They only bust the meth labs because it's not government run or big pharma run.
[02:28:13.457 --> 02:28:18.979]  I mean, something like 25% of kids, mainly boys, are on speed now.
[02:28:18.979 --> 02:28:21.080]  And this is absolutely screwing these kids over.
[02:28:22.964 --> 02:28:25.925]  You know, these parents are wondering what's going on with their children.
[02:28:25.925 --> 02:28:30.287]  They need to read the ingredients that this big pharma is pushing on their kids.
[02:28:30.287 --> 02:28:37.390]  More than that, if they eat the red dyes, the sugars... I mean, I'll break down sometimes and give my kids some crap sugar, and then they're demons.
[02:28:37.390 --> 02:28:41.091]  I mean, as long as I don't give them processed dyes and sugars and additives, they're fine.
[02:28:41.091 --> 02:28:42.372]  I mean, of course they act crazy.
[02:28:42.372 --> 02:28:45.653]  If I fed my dog some of these candies, it would go crazy.
[02:28:47.675 --> 02:28:49.016]  Well, thank you very much for your time.
[02:28:49.016 --> 02:28:52.298]  I know you're on a tight show and thanks for everything that you're bringing up.
[02:28:52.298 --> 02:28:53.319]  No, no, don't thank me.
[02:28:53.319 --> 02:28:54.519]  We are all in this together.
[02:28:54.519 --> 02:28:55.720]  God bless you, brother.
[02:28:55.720 --> 02:28:56.601]  There goes Christopher.
[02:28:56.601 --> 02:28:59.462]  I'm not going to go to calls yet because I don't want to cut you down to a minute.
[02:28:59.462 --> 02:29:02.684]  Corey and Rex and Matthew and Dean and others.
[02:29:02.684 --> 02:29:06.907]  And when I'm done with those calls, I'm going to shift gears into the news and the clips I haven't hit yet.
[02:29:08.228 --> 02:29:12.114]  So what I call a news blitz that I hardly ever get to will be coming up.
[02:29:12.114 --> 02:29:14.558]  Bernanke says slow growth is weighing on U.S.
[02:29:14.558 --> 02:29:14.919]  economy.
[02:29:14.919 --> 02:29:16.721]  That's a huge admission.
[02:29:16.721 --> 02:29:18.063]  CNBC said that today.
[02:29:20.768 --> 02:29:22.170]  He was on CNBC.
[02:29:22.170 --> 02:29:23.832]  You mean we're not in the greatest economy ever?
[02:29:23.832 --> 02:29:25.574]  I thought everything was wonderful.
[02:29:25.574 --> 02:29:28.517]  So we've been telling this for a while, but there is the admission.
[02:29:28.517 --> 02:29:34.704]  That ties into job creation, Mrs. Big in September, but then they go on to ask, but really, what is the job situation?
[02:29:34.704 --> 02:29:37.507]  Because they admit those numbers are even faked.
[02:29:37.507 --> 02:29:41.592]  Even mainstream news, CNBC admits it's fake numbers, but the fake numbers are bad.
[02:29:43.268 --> 02:29:45.891]  And then they spin it like, we'll just have confidence it'll fix it.
[02:29:45.891 --> 02:29:46.312]  No!
[02:29:46.312 --> 02:29:48.274]  Turn the power plants back on!
[02:29:48.274 --> 02:29:49.736]  That's a good start!
[02:29:49.736 --> 02:29:50.877]  Cheap energy!
[02:29:50.877 --> 02:29:52.479]  All starts there!
[02:29:52.479 --> 02:29:55.143]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.406 --> 02:30:01.467]  Skip Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[02:30:01.467 --> 02:30:05.289]  President Obama implied that the federal government should confiscate all guns.
[02:30:05.289 --> 02:30:06.030]  That's right.
[02:30:06.030 --> 02:30:11.253]  The president responsible for the deaths of women and children via drone strikes is now trying to eradicate the Second Amendment.
[02:30:11.253 --> 02:30:21.939]  When Obama responded to the October 1st attack on an Oregon community college, he went beyond his usual demand for more gun control and suggested that America should consider outright banning guns just like Australia and Great Britain.
[02:30:22.159 --> 02:30:30.803]  But it's hypocritical for Obama to demand that Americans turn in their guns when, according to the Pentagon, the Obama administration is backing ISIS in its war against the Syrian government.
[02:30:30.803 --> 02:30:36.345]  In fact, in September 2013, President Obama waived a federal law specifically designed to keep the U.S.
[02:30:36.345 --> 02:30:39.507]  government from supplying firearms to terrorist groups such as ISIS.
[02:30:39.507 --> 02:30:43.209]  On the very same day, he demanded more gun control in response to the D.C.
[02:30:43.209 --> 02:30:43.969]  Navy Yard shooting.
[02:30:44.309 --> 02:30:51.798]  In other words, Obama is shipping guns to Islamic militants, aka moderate rebels, while simultaneously trying to disarm American citizens.
[02:30:51.798 --> 02:30:58.766]  Once again, this is Kent Daniels with TheInfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv, and check out our new YouTube channel called Resistance News.
[02:30:59.206 --> 02:31:08.251]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:31:08.251 --> 02:31:16.356]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:31:16.636 --> 02:31:21.518]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:31:21.518 --> 02:31:28.301]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:28.301 --> 02:31:35.483]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:31:35.483 --> 02:31:37.204]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[02:31:37.384 --> 02:31:42.505]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:31:42.505 --> 02:31:46.987]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:31:46.987 --> 02:31:50.388]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[02:33:13.346 --> 02:33:20.123]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:20.123 --> 02:33:21.767]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:50.458 --> 02:33:52.399]  Pull the trigger!
[02:33:52.399 --> 02:33:53.460]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:53.460 --> 02:33:54.520]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:58.482]  We're pulling the trigger on trying to expose the globalist agenda worldwide.
[02:33:58.482 --> 02:34:03.905]  And patriots from countries all across the planet, male, female, it doesn't matter.
[02:34:03.905 --> 02:34:05.846]  Sorry, I just heard people saying the word male and female.
[02:34:05.846 --> 02:34:07.047]  That hurts folks that aren't.
[02:34:07.047 --> 02:34:07.887]  See the mind control?
[02:34:07.887 --> 02:34:10.469]  See how over the top this is?
[02:34:10.469 --> 02:34:13.991]  See how these people mean business?
[02:34:13.991 --> 02:34:16.432]  Well, we mean business all over the world.
[02:34:17.865 --> 02:34:35.955]  Exposing the globalist agenda and fighting it, and as people begin to understand the logic of the New World Order, the twisted, wicked, demonic system that they're bringing forward, people understand there's no making a deal with Beelzebub.
[02:34:35.955 --> 02:34:38.356]  And they realize they're not part of the deal.
[02:34:38.356 --> 02:34:43.539]  They're schmucks, they're jokes, they're idiots, they're chumps, they're fools, they're suckers.
[02:34:45.285 --> 02:34:59.308]  And as folks begin to realize this, they're understanding that they need to say no to the system because this system is the opposite of a cultural agreement or a cultural compact or a social contract.
[02:34:59.308 --> 02:35:10.511]  This is a contract for global extermination and slowly turning the lights off, slowly turning the infrastructure off, slowly playing God.
[02:35:11.894 --> 02:35:21.861]  God, according to every ancient text, basically every culture, the Aztecs, the Jews, the Babylonians, the Greeks, have the flood mythology.
[02:35:21.861 --> 02:35:26.344]  Whether you believe it's real or not, there have been a lot of big floods, but a global flood mythology.
[02:35:26.344 --> 02:35:36.751]  And God got angry and flooded the whole planet, and there were these big glaciers and other things under the Earth's crust, and it opened up the fountains of the deep.
[02:35:38.180 --> 02:35:42.921]  And the ecology of the planet changed, and it rained for 40 days and 40 nights.
[02:35:42.921 --> 02:36:02.986]  Well, the New World Order, I guess, has read that God's going to destroy the Earth next time by fire, and roll up the heavens like a great scroll after the thousand-year reign of Valhalla, here on Elysium.
[02:36:02.986 --> 02:36:06.347]  And so the story ends, and we're transported on to the next realm.
[02:36:08.882 --> 02:36:15.463]  It's a lot heavier than what you heard in the church, because they don't want to actually read from the Bible and tell you all that.
[02:36:15.463 --> 02:36:16.423]  But let's just move on.
[02:36:16.423 --> 02:36:19.324]  Whether it's real or not, let's just not have that debate.
[02:36:19.324 --> 02:36:24.805]  God first came and destroyed us by water, but the rainbow came and promised, not by water, next by fire.
[02:36:24.805 --> 02:36:27.525]  Well, the globalists are killing us by genetic engineering.
[02:36:27.525 --> 02:36:32.446]  They're killing us by New World Order overwrite, by infiltration, by takeover.
[02:36:32.446 --> 02:36:36.647]  Basically, it's like a slow motion John Carpenter's 1982 remake of The Thing.
[02:36:42.637 --> 02:36:43.444]  But it's slow motion.
[02:36:44.445 --> 02:36:46.846]  It doesn't just take over in a day or a week or a month.
[02:36:46.846 --> 02:36:48.927]  It takes over over decades.
[02:36:48.927 --> 02:36:51.229]  And every life form has changed.
[02:36:51.229 --> 02:36:52.789]  Every atmosphere is manipulated.
[02:36:52.789 --> 02:36:54.430]  Every culture is brought down.
[02:36:54.430 --> 02:36:56.271]  Every family is broken up.
[02:36:56.271 --> 02:36:59.513]  And the brains are slowly poisoned and slowly dumbed down.
[02:36:59.513 --> 02:37:00.954]  Where no one knows where it came from.
[02:37:00.954 --> 02:37:03.635]  And you're in such a drug-induced haze.
[02:37:03.635 --> 02:37:05.176]  Such a chemical-induced haze.
[02:37:05.176 --> 02:37:07.237]  Such a poisoned GMO haze.
[02:37:07.237 --> 02:37:10.119]  Such a glyphosate-drunken state.
[02:37:10.119 --> 02:37:11.820]  That you don't even know why you're dying.
[02:37:11.820 --> 02:37:13.781]  You don't even care by the time it hits you.
[02:37:14.926 --> 02:37:17.007]  Because you already were soft killed.
[02:37:17.007 --> 02:37:28.435]  Metaphysical rule, they've got to first have us physically rot and fall, and rot our minds, or they can't fully move against us until we've been debased and turned into animals.
[02:37:28.435 --> 02:37:38.402]  And until, as a group, we call for humans to be destroyed, we call for our system to be overwritten, we call for a world without man, we hate ourselves,
[02:37:39.585 --> 02:37:47.910]  We kill our young, we defile ourselves, we have taste testing systems made of dead baby parts, you know, Pepsi.
[02:37:47.910 --> 02:37:51.973]  We just give in to all of this.
[02:37:51.973 --> 02:37:57.917]  It's the metaphor from that pretty good movie with the black comedian Eddie Murphy.
[02:38:00.683 --> 02:38:03.826]  I said black comedian Eddie Murphy because it's a trick for me to remember their name.
[02:38:03.826 --> 02:38:05.247]  I'm stalling to remember their name.
[02:38:05.247 --> 02:38:07.369]  Teleprompter free, Eddie Murphy.
[02:38:07.369 --> 02:38:15.377]  The golden child, we're the top demon, has got to get the golden child to eat the poison of other dead kids, the blood of other dead kids.
[02:38:15.377 --> 02:38:24.125]  He's got to physically defile him so he can just get him ready to basically be starved to death and be so weak they're able to kill him with this particular dagger.
[02:38:25.287 --> 02:38:27.588]  And that's a really good metaphor for how this works.
[02:38:27.588 --> 02:38:31.929]  They gotta poison all of us because we're all God's golden children.
[02:38:31.929 --> 02:38:39.072]  They gotta get us all ready and as poisoned and as soft killed and stumbling around before they come and hit us with the main salvo.
[02:38:43.410 --> 02:39:03.360]  I mean, the elite are all aware of this, and they understand if they don't avoid the GMO, if they don't avoid the fluoride, if they don't avoid it all, then they're not enlightened ones, and so they all have their special gardens, their special drugs, their clean vaccines, it's all on record, and they just religiously have their own food trucks, their own jets, their own everything, and they all get in line, and they're all aware of it.
[02:39:03.360 --> 02:39:06.922]  We're talking maybe 6,000, 7,000 people on the planet.
[02:39:08.976 --> 02:39:15.181]  In their own words, are aware of this, and they just totally try to just get ready, and they're all very scared in the elite.
[02:39:15.181 --> 02:39:16.603]  Yes, we're going to carry out the plan.
[02:39:16.603 --> 02:39:17.484]  It's better for the Earth.
[02:39:17.484 --> 02:39:26.632]  We've got to get everything de-industrialized and all the nations ready to fall so they can't stand against the world government when it does the mopping up of the population in emergency surgery to save the Earth.
[02:39:26.632 --> 02:39:28.613]  The caring population is too big.
[02:39:28.613 --> 02:39:29.754]  The planet's dying.
[02:39:29.754 --> 02:39:34.939]  Well, then why are you GMOing and toxic waste dumping and doing everything you can to kill the Earth?
[02:39:35.379 --> 02:39:40.000]  While you claim you're going to block off the technologies to us and then wipe us out to save it.
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:51.063]  The truth is you're greedily grabbing control and being promised all this power by your masters who are not going to give you the life extension when it gets down.
[02:39:51.063 --> 02:39:55.404]  The deeper globalist statements and documents are they're not even going to keep a million people around.
[02:39:55.404 --> 02:39:58.824]  They tell their acolytes, their minions, 100 million.
[02:39:58.824 --> 02:40:01.105]  They're not going to keep a million around, you idiots.
[02:40:04.804 --> 02:40:06.706]  Do you understand?
[02:40:06.706 --> 02:40:11.910]  Their nature is not going to change as they continue to power grab.
[02:40:11.910 --> 02:40:14.372]  You're complete idiots!
[02:40:14.372 --> 02:40:16.954]  You're not part of the ruling elite!
[02:40:16.954 --> 02:40:23.559]  You are not going to be given eternal life by the system!
[02:40:23.559 --> 02:40:26.161]  And I've talked to some of these people and they know that.
[02:40:26.161 --> 02:40:27.743]  And they go, I know, what do you do?
[02:40:30.748 --> 02:40:34.771]  Because let me tell you, these people start turning against their masters, they get killed real quick.
[02:40:34.771 --> 02:40:36.292]  See, I've never joined these people.
[02:40:36.292 --> 02:40:38.274]  I've never taken anything from them.
[02:40:38.274 --> 02:40:40.936]  I spiritually have announced that I'm not part of them.
[02:40:40.936 --> 02:40:44.358]  And that's why I'm somewhat hands-off.
[02:40:44.358 --> 02:40:53.926]  I have to be seduced in by all their sub-corruptions before I can get to some level where I wake up and I'm in their hands.
[02:40:53.926 --> 02:40:55.587]  But I'm aware of that.
[02:40:55.587 --> 02:40:59.110]  But this is the master seduction of humanity that you're witnessing.
[02:41:00.031 --> 02:41:13.064]  And if you believe the Bible, it's being run by an ancient, powerful entity with super-advanced intelligence that is feeding high-tech technology to its internal priesthood to be developed, tested, and deployed.
[02:41:14.246 --> 02:41:33.728]  Now, if you don't believe that, how did people in 1854, 1855 envision the double helix of DNA, envision genetic engineering, envision the science of biometrics, social engineering, and the whole plan dropped to the brain of Sir Francis Galton, Charles Darwin, his cousin, and others?
[02:41:37.639 --> 02:41:44.742]  Because you go back and study eugenics, by the 1860s they had the whole plan, atomic weapons.
[02:41:44.742 --> 02:41:48.524]  Everything already envisioned.
[02:41:48.524 --> 02:41:50.245]  And these guys would just get up.
[02:41:50.245 --> 02:41:54.587]  Charles Darwin wrote a book about this, not his deal on the species, but several other books.
[02:41:54.587 --> 02:41:54.987]  I've read them.
[02:41:54.987 --> 02:41:55.547]  You can go look them up.
[02:41:55.547 --> 02:41:56.227]  I forget the name of the one.
[02:41:56.227 --> 02:42:00.249]  It was a short book about how he would just get up and have these hallucinations.
[02:42:00.249 --> 02:42:02.570]  And then he would just go and be able to write all this stuff out.
[02:42:02.570 --> 02:42:04.131]  The guy was possessed, folks.
[02:42:06.542 --> 02:42:07.902]  Galton did the same thing.
[02:42:07.902 --> 02:42:11.904]  They would just envision all of this and then it worked.
[02:42:11.904 --> 02:42:17.845]  30 years later, they've got IBM coming out with computers.
[02:42:17.845 --> 02:42:23.507]  But of course, to race study, to study humans, how to control humans.
[02:42:23.507 --> 02:42:27.088]  So, a lot of the elite believe they deserve all the power because
[02:42:29.534 --> 02:42:39.798]  They did hatch all of this, and now they're building giant cyclotrons, Hadron Collider and others, and breaking dimensional gates.
[02:42:39.798 --> 02:42:41.379]  And I don't know what's behind those dimensions.
[02:42:41.379 --> 02:42:48.201]  This isn't Hollywood, but this is a lot more powerful than atomic and hydrogen bombs, and they admit that.
[02:42:48.201 --> 02:42:53.283]  So see, they're so enamored by the crystal ball of the knowledge of good and evil that they have.
[02:42:56.135 --> 02:43:06.419]  That I sit there and watch people, I was at a restaurant, I'm going to go to your calls, having brunch yesterday for about two hours.
[02:43:06.419 --> 02:43:10.241]  And I was watching people watch the NFL.
[02:43:10.241 --> 02:43:11.561]  And I was watching them talk about it.
[02:43:11.561 --> 02:43:12.982]  I mean, these people weren't alive.
[02:43:12.982 --> 02:43:14.462]  They weren't awake.
[02:43:14.462 --> 02:43:17.143]  They didn't want to be alive or awake.
[02:43:17.143 --> 02:43:20.725]  And they thought the world was about NFL teams.
[02:43:20.725 --> 02:43:24.206]  I mean, can you imagine that we've got elites that 160 years ago,
[02:43:27.372 --> 02:43:44.824]  We're envisioning the proto equations that 30, 40 years ago, 30, 40 years later, were translated into action, then suppressed from the public for 40 plus years, and then built in secret.
[02:43:44.824 --> 02:43:50.148]  90 years after they had visions about it.
[02:43:50.148 --> 02:43:56.693]  And then the British, under the royalty, you can look this up, it's in their deeper annals, began to breed these psychic families
[02:43:58.131 --> 02:44:00.572]  You know, the Orwells were on the side of these families.
[02:44:00.572 --> 02:44:02.413]  They were partially married into them.
[02:44:02.413 --> 02:44:15.379]  They began to secretly marry all these families together, these scientist families, these occult families, to then produce people
[02:44:17.205 --> 02:44:20.367]  Like Aldous Huxley and Julian Huxley.
[02:44:20.367 --> 02:44:22.589]  And Aldous was the propagandist.
[02:44:22.589 --> 02:44:29.473]  And Julian was the guy actually putting the plan in worldwide for the first Director General of UNESCO.
[02:44:29.473 --> 02:44:35.737]  And he wrote about all these plans in the 40s that we're now living exactly what he said.
[02:44:35.737 --> 02:44:39.900]  But who cares about some guy that made our civilization as it is?
[02:44:39.900 --> 02:44:44.503]  Who cares about somebody that actually decided to put the cancer viruses in the vaccines?
[02:44:44.503 --> 02:44:45.824]  Who cares if his brother wrote in 1932
[02:44:48.686 --> 02:44:52.408]  About super advanced genetic engineering and all the discoveries and what would be done.
[02:44:52.408 --> 02:44:55.289]  And then you read it and you go, this isn't science fiction.
[02:44:55.289 --> 02:44:55.750]  It isn't.
[02:44:55.750 --> 02:44:57.190]  They already knew all that.
[02:44:57.190 --> 02:45:02.833]  They were telling you in a science fiction book.
[02:45:02.833 --> 02:45:09.617]  Oh, who cares about the master priest who built our current reality?
[02:45:09.617 --> 02:45:13.099]  By siphoning off the intellect and intelligence of humanity.
[02:45:15.885 --> 02:45:34.365]  Having visions, they believe, being directed by spiritual entities to then go out and find the minds that could help them manifest and build it with the technological scientific elite that Eisenhower talked about.
[02:45:34.365 --> 02:45:38.269]  We're talking about people who believe they basically are avatars, like the movie Avatar.
[02:45:39.485 --> 02:45:44.826]  With spiritual life forms entering them and then directing them.
[02:45:44.826 --> 02:45:50.968]  Whether you believe any of this or not, do you understand that's who runs things?
[02:45:50.968 --> 02:45:57.250]  The microchips, the helicopters, all of it.
[02:45:57.250 --> 02:45:59.290]  Now here's the big secret.
[02:45:59.290 --> 02:46:02.271]  Humans already knew how to build this stuff.
[02:46:04.500 --> 02:46:13.467]  The globalists just simply envision it and know it can be built and then go out and find the people from the common population generally.
[02:46:13.467 --> 02:46:18.110]  These inventions aren't coming from the inbred elites.
[02:46:18.110 --> 02:46:22.694]  The directives are.
[02:46:22.694 --> 02:46:25.616]  So, yes, we are made in the image of the Creator.
[02:46:25.616 --> 02:46:29.279]  We are made in the image of the entity that created the universe.
[02:46:29.279 --> 02:46:32.121]  That's basic Christian cosmology.
[02:46:33.080 --> 02:46:35.081]  But do you not see what's hidden behind that?
[02:46:35.081 --> 02:46:54.429]  Because even if none of that's real, even if there aren't entities possessing these people, even if God and the devil aren't real and all that, we as a mass group, 7.5 billion people, are able to envision things that science fiction 100 years ago is reality today.
[02:46:54.429 --> 02:46:58.350]  Science fiction 20 years ago are reality next month.
[02:46:58.350 --> 02:47:02.652]  Science fiction 5 years ago, reality in 3 months.
[02:47:04.716 --> 02:47:08.417]  Science fiction a year ago, reality in five years.
[02:47:08.417 --> 02:47:15.940]  As you notice, it's compacting in time now, as the inventions compound and accelerate, building something really big.
[02:47:15.940 --> 02:47:26.403]  And there's one spirit trying to build something wholesome and good and happy for humans that is long-term, truly sustainable, beautiful, great, empowering, free-will based.
[02:47:26.403 --> 02:47:28.864]  But that construction is under attack.
[02:47:28.864 --> 02:47:30.885]  Instead, we see what's really being built.
[02:47:31.795 --> 02:47:36.362]  And let me tell you, it's the ugliest thing the universe ever saw.
[02:47:36.362 --> 02:47:40.329]  It's women pouring Drano in their eyes, and national British television saying it's wonderful.
[02:47:42.412 --> 02:47:49.837]  It's the state coming and telling your seven-year-old how to be transgender in your life, sexualizing your child, pedophilia out in the open.
[02:47:49.837 --> 02:47:54.340]  They've got to get you ready for crazy stuff because you ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:47:54.340 --> 02:48:08.370]  This is the kickoff of a total war against humanity because the elite, whatever they are, do not want humans to get what is about to be built.
[02:48:08.370 --> 02:48:11.052]  We're supposed to build it.
[02:48:11.052 --> 02:48:11.733]  We're builders.
[02:48:13.015 --> 02:48:14.376]  We're geniuses.
[02:48:14.376 --> 02:48:15.697]  We're incredible.
[02:48:15.697 --> 02:48:16.978]  We don't know it.
[02:48:16.978 --> 02:48:18.620]  We don't understand it.
[02:48:18.620 --> 02:48:20.101]  It's been kept from us.
[02:48:20.101 --> 02:48:27.267]  We're building the spaceships, all of it, for the scum.
[02:48:27.267 --> 02:48:30.410]  And then the future doesn't need us anymore.
[02:48:30.410 --> 02:48:32.012]  All we are is a bunch of body parts.
[02:48:33.146 --> 02:48:35.408]  All we are is a bunch of cannon fodder.
[02:48:35.408 --> 02:48:55.065]  All we are is a bunch of trash to them, and they tell us all day with a message, you're trash, you're ugly, you're scum, you're filthy, you hate yourself, but you kind of could be strong if you pour Drano in your eyes, or if you chop your member off, or if you get all this, or if you join with a group, I didn't mean politics, join with a big group that we can direct, and then you'll be powerful.
[02:48:56.288 --> 02:48:58.270]  Then you join the group, you're not powerful.
[02:48:58.270 --> 02:49:11.780]  I said I'd cover a bunch of news, and I've done okay today, but I didn't get to a bunch of it, and Paul Watson's coming up, he'll cover a lot of it, but I really prayed last night, as hard as I could, and this morning, that I would just come in here and really just get to the bottom of it.
[02:49:11.780 --> 02:49:14.542]  We've got to get off this planet.
[02:49:14.542 --> 02:49:18.345]  Once we hit that stride, we'll be able to terraform.
[02:49:18.345 --> 02:49:21.668]  Look how far we've come so far, and then look how far we can go.
[02:49:21.668 --> 02:49:24.290]  We've got to become a type one civilization.
[02:49:25.950 --> 02:49:27.571]  We've got to reach out to other people.
[02:49:27.571 --> 02:49:29.172]  We've got to transcend the globalists.
[02:49:29.172 --> 02:49:30.933]  We have to realize their larger plan.
[02:49:30.933 --> 02:49:33.635]  We have to see it for what it is.
[02:49:33.635 --> 02:49:36.497]  And then it's really laughable what they're doing.
[02:49:36.497 --> 02:49:43.182]  And then you know they're going to end up failing because no matter what they do to humanity, no matter how oppressive, how destructive, how evil,
[02:49:44.830 --> 02:49:54.153]  It will hurt the general mass of people, but it will cause others to resist in ways we can't even imagine that will bring down this system, and that's why they're so scared of us.
[02:49:54.153 --> 02:50:02.136]  If you look at globalists with their hubris, their act, how they're acting tough, they are scared to death of good men and women.
[02:50:02.136 --> 02:50:06.678]  You carry the light in the dark of the night, and they know it.
[02:50:06.678 --> 02:50:07.078]  And they
[02:50:08.632 --> 02:50:12.954]  We're brought into this power, not as rulers, but as minions.
[02:50:12.954 --> 02:50:14.534]  As worker bees.
[02:50:14.534 --> 02:50:16.055]  And they're scared of their master.
[02:50:16.055 --> 02:50:18.015]  They're slaves.
[02:50:18.015 --> 02:50:23.277]  And they are trying to do the best job they can, as fast as they can, or they'll be destroyed.
[02:50:23.277 --> 02:50:26.198]  You notice how often globalists have horrible ends and terrible things?
[02:50:26.198 --> 02:50:28.939]  I mean, these people are dishonorable to each other.
[02:50:28.939 --> 02:50:31.440]  This is the worst group to ever want to join.
[02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:32.661]  Nobody wants to be with these people.
[02:50:32.661 --> 02:50:33.881]  This is insanity.
[02:50:36.926 --> 02:50:38.267]  Do not join with the New World Order.
[02:50:38.267 --> 02:50:39.747]  Do not join with the devil.
[02:50:39.747 --> 02:50:43.009]  Do not join with Satan and all his pumps.
[02:50:43.009 --> 02:50:46.931]  And don't feel guilty just because you have a dark side that God wouldn't ever want you.
[02:50:46.931 --> 02:50:47.771]  That's not true.
[02:50:47.771 --> 02:50:48.892]  God made you.
[02:50:48.892 --> 02:50:52.134]  God understands you had to have all this knowledge to be what you are.
[02:50:52.134 --> 02:50:53.074]  But your heart's good.
[02:50:53.074 --> 02:50:56.756]  We'll be back with some final phone calls and news and Paul Watson's coming up.
[02:50:59.266 --> 02:51:10.157]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[02:51:10.157 --> 02:51:14.341]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[02:51:14.341 --> 02:51:16.483]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:16.483 --> 02:51:21.948]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:22.108 --> 02:51:32.131]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:51:32.131 --> 02:51:38.633]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:51:38.633 --> 02:51:41.974]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[02:51:41.974 --> 02:51:44.035]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:51:44.035 --> 02:51:46.976]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:51:47.176 --> 02:51:49.637]  Heart and body extract gets results.

[02:54:00.208 --> 02:54:06.937]  All right, I'm gonna hit a bunch of final news and do five minutes of overdrive and hand the baton over to Paul Watson.
[02:54:06.937 --> 02:54:13.785]  So I'll be going to Rex, that's my son's name, and then we'll be going to, uh, whoever's been holding the longest, Matthew and Dean.
[02:54:13.785 --> 02:54:15.407]  I don't know if I can get to Ronnie just because of the time.
[02:54:15.407 --> 02:54:16.128]  Maybe you can talk to Paul.
[02:54:17.069 --> 02:54:19.150]  Briefly, this is Lister Supported Radio.
[02:54:19.150 --> 02:54:19.970]  We have some sponsors.
[02:54:19.970 --> 02:54:21.910]  Some of the sponsors are the network sponsors.
[02:54:21.910 --> 02:54:29.833]  I fund the Infowars operation by you buying books, videos, Hillary for Prison t-shirts, Mass Murders Agree, Gun Control Work shirts.
[02:54:29.833 --> 02:54:33.314]  You see Obama rallying his gun grabbers to action in the streets.
[02:54:33.314 --> 02:54:35.474]  You need to get aggressive, folks, or they're going to win.
[02:54:35.474 --> 02:54:39.576]  We've been winning on this front, but we've got to double down.
[02:54:39.576 --> 02:54:43.957]  Also, we've got 20% off Prostagard, one of the lowest priced, highest quality
[02:54:44.773 --> 02:54:46.874]  Prostate formula's out there.
[02:54:46.874 --> 02:54:49.175]  It's only $15.
[02:54:49.175 --> 02:54:50.216]  $15.96.
[02:54:50.216 --> 02:54:52.317]  Right now at Infowarslife.com.
[02:54:52.317 --> 02:54:55.299]  Survival Shield X2 will sell out early this week, I believe.
[02:54:55.299 --> 02:54:58.260]  But more is hopefully coming in.
[02:54:58.260 --> 02:55:02.222]  Liver Shield sold out for three months, is now back in stock.
[02:55:02.222 --> 02:55:04.043]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:55:04.043 --> 02:55:07.906]  And your purchase absolutely makes everything here happen.
[02:55:07.906 --> 02:55:10.247]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:55:10.247 --> 02:55:10.647]  Now,
[02:55:16.380 --> 02:55:24.143]  You notice that the PC police stuff, if you're 30, 40, 50, 60 years old, 70 years old, just sounds like absolute ridiculous satire.
[02:55:24.143 --> 02:55:25.424]  You laugh at it.
[02:55:25.424 --> 02:55:30.846]  But you were given an earlier brainwashing cultural template.
[02:55:30.846 --> 02:55:34.787]  And even some of your parents and stuff that wasn't globalist if you're 56 years old.
[02:55:34.787 --> 02:55:41.590]  If you're 20, you are immersed in this and chewed out and called out in class and told all day how bad you are.
[02:55:42.481 --> 02:55:56.028]  I know a lot of UT students, folks that have gone back to school and things, and they say, no matter what class you're in, you're called out, you're ridiculed, if you're white, you know, you are told that you're inherently evil.
[02:55:56.028 --> 02:56:03.932]  And it's not even by the so-called minority students, this is led by the teachers, a lot of them who are, quote, white.
[02:56:03.932 --> 02:56:05.153]  And this is a war.
[02:56:05.153 --> 02:56:11.836]  This is a culture war to make everybody identify, according to class and what color they are, to put everybody in groups and make everybody fight with each other.
[02:56:14.090 --> 02:56:21.915]  So now they even have the old left coming out, like South Park and people like Jerry Seinfeld saying, this is terrible.
[02:56:21.915 --> 02:56:23.596]  But see, the globalists knew that would happen.
[02:56:23.596 --> 02:56:25.036]  They don't care.
[02:56:25.036 --> 02:56:29.319]  Because people under 25 or so, this is all they know.
[02:56:29.319 --> 02:56:36.883]  And they have been dumbed down so much, the studies show, not all young people, but on average, that folks, they don't even know where state capitals are.
[02:56:36.883 --> 02:56:40.886]  You've seen the people Mark Dice talks to, the one of, you know, 9 out of 10 want to put governors in FEMA camps.
[02:56:44.137 --> 02:56:47.158]  I mean, these people will do anything they're told.
[02:56:47.158 --> 02:56:49.938]  So the globalists are testing right now, pushing it.
[02:56:49.938 --> 02:56:56.340]  Lesbian Swedish Bishop wants Christian crosses removed from churches in Sweden now that Muslims are arriving.
[02:56:56.340 --> 02:57:00.161]  She says, give the churches to the Muslims.
[02:57:00.161 --> 02:57:04.582]  I'm not against Muslims, but they're going to use them in this clash because they're not going to give their culture up.
[02:57:04.582 --> 02:57:07.843]  We've been trained to give our culture up.
[02:57:07.843 --> 02:57:11.684]  PC police want to ban ham sandwiches because Muslims find them offensive.
[02:57:11.684 --> 02:57:12.684]  We told you this was coming.
[02:57:13.993 --> 02:57:29.540]  Businesses should ban ham sandwiches and sausage rolls from the workplace and they team up with the left, vegetarians, are offensive to Muslims and other religions according to new guidelines written for employers and this is what's accepted by the UK government as policy by these groups and put into government handbooks.
[02:57:29.540 --> 02:57:36.683]  The guidelines published by Coexist House, a US-UK based interfaith group, recommend an outright ban on pork products from office kitchens.
[02:57:36.683 --> 02:57:37.864]  Next will be meat itself.
[02:57:38.772 --> 02:57:40.113]  And it just goes in.
[02:57:40.113 --> 02:57:42.254]  They even have the bishops calling for it.
[02:57:42.254 --> 02:57:43.115]  So there you go.
[02:57:43.115 --> 02:57:44.776]  Because these aren't bishops.
[02:57:44.776 --> 02:57:49.659]  The seminaries got taken over 60, 70 years ago by the Rockefellers on record in Europe and here.
[02:57:49.659 --> 02:57:51.240]  They then just put their people in.
[02:57:51.240 --> 02:58:02.707]  And you go to these mainline churches now, Catholic or Protestant, and you walk in, and I mean, you're hearing a government doctrine, and in a year, they can change agent from Jesus, you know,
[02:58:03.789 --> 02:58:18.097]  was the son of God to Jesus was nobody and Jesus failed and you know your children need to be given to the pedophiles and then people have been incrementally done and manipulated where they can't give up, they can't leave that church.
[02:58:18.097 --> 02:58:22.039]  Then they go in 501c3 and kill the others they don't control.
[02:58:22.039 --> 02:58:24.560]  Is Obama refugee served coming to your town?
[02:58:24.560 --> 02:58:27.382]  New American breaks it down and says yes.
[02:58:27.382 --> 02:58:28.263]  U.S.C.D.
[02:58:28.263 --> 02:58:29.903]  says term minority is offensive.
[02:58:29.903 --> 02:58:30.484]  Gotta ban that.
[02:58:31.448 --> 02:58:33.311]  Alright, we're going to go on a break here for 60 seconds.
[02:58:33.311 --> 02:58:34.152]  Some stations leave us.
[02:58:34.152 --> 02:58:35.173]  We love you all.
[02:58:35.173 --> 02:58:36.335]  And Paul Weiss is coming up.
[02:58:36.335 --> 02:58:37.556]  Your call is straight ahead.
[02:58:37.556 --> 02:58:40.220]  Infowars.com forward slash show to find the free fees.
[02:58:40.220 --> 02:58:40.721]  Spread the word.

[02:58:41.542 --> 02:58:43.224]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.224 --> 02:58:45.247]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:49.119 --> 02:58:49.679]  I want more candy!
[02:58:49.679 --> 02:58:50.840]  I want more video games!
[02:58:50.840 --> 02:58:51.020]  Mine!
[02:58:51.020 --> 02:58:52.301]  Mine!
[02:58:52.301 --> 02:58:52.401]  Mine!
[02:59:19.119 --> 02:59:19.859]  I think so.
[02:59:51.730 --> 03:00:01.913]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.913 --> 03:00:08.514]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:08.514 --> 03:00:12.535]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:12.535 --> 03:00:18.137]  You know, I've been saying Central Texas Command Center for 20 years on air, and I didn't do it to be cheesy.
[03:00:18.137 --> 03:00:19.177]  I didn't do it to really be funny.
[03:00:21.129 --> 03:00:24.951]  I knew folks would laugh at it, but I had to get people to understand this is a war on fear mind.
[03:00:24.951 --> 03:00:26.132]  It's a global government.
[03:00:26.132 --> 03:00:27.573]  It's coming after you and your family.
[03:00:27.573 --> 03:00:33.637]  They've authorized the Pentagon to engage in domestic lies, the CIA to target folks for psychiatrists and brainwashing.
[03:00:33.637 --> 03:00:36.678]  It's all being announced.
[03:00:36.678 --> 03:00:41.741]  So I do come to you from the Central Texas Command Center in occupied territory, FEMA Region 6.
[03:00:41.741 --> 03:00:42.922]  They haven't mopped up everywhere.
[03:00:42.922 --> 03:00:43.983]  They haven't taken over everywhere.
[03:00:43.983 --> 03:00:45.904]  In fact, the states are fighting back.
[03:00:45.904 --> 03:00:47.225]  Congress is fighting back.
[03:00:47.225 --> 03:00:50.587]  We got to admit how much trouble we're in to be able to beat this.
[03:00:52.816 --> 03:00:53.636]  Hey Alex, first term power.
[03:01:21.773 --> 03:01:24.094]  I've been listening to you for a few months now.
[03:01:24.094 --> 03:01:31.719]  I just wanted to ask you, I noticed an article, the petition for 2012 to impeach Obama.
[03:01:35.520 --> 03:01:35.900]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:35.900 --> 03:01:39.141]  And I was just checking to see how that went.
[03:01:39.141 --> 03:01:41.442]  I don't know what the final result of that was.
[03:01:41.442 --> 03:01:42.042]  Well, here it is.
[03:01:42.042 --> 03:01:51.465]  They set up the White House petition to act like they listen to people, and as a stunt, so they could pick the things they wanted and claim it came from the people, and have their own groups write the stuff.
[03:01:51.465 --> 03:01:58.627]  So we admitted the thing was a joke, so we said, use it like a toilet, and just go in there and just point out the hypocrisy.
[03:01:58.627 --> 03:02:01.548]  So we said, do a petition to deport Piers Morgan.
[03:02:01.548 --> 03:02:03.109]  So he'd take the bait and have me on his show.
[03:02:04.049 --> 03:02:07.051]  Okay, well I've noticed there's been a lot of other people like
[03:02:32.924 --> 03:02:38.086]  I saw a lady on the internet named Morley Tate.
[03:02:38.086 --> 03:02:45.049]  She's brought impeachment proceedings against him, but every time it seems like it doesn't work.
[03:02:45.049 --> 03:02:49.791]  Well, you've got to have it by the House, and you've got to have him indicted in the House, tried in the Senate.
[03:02:49.791 --> 03:02:51.492]  I appreciate your call, Rex.
[03:02:51.492 --> 03:02:52.733]  Good to hear from you.
[03:02:52.733 --> 03:02:54.413]  Lex, Rex.
[03:02:54.413 --> 03:02:56.634]  Let's talk to Matthew in Mississippi.
[03:02:56.634 --> 03:02:57.234]  You're on the air.
[03:02:57.234 --> 03:02:59.976]  Hey, how's it going?
[03:02:59.976 --> 03:03:00.376]  Good, brother.
[03:03:00.376 --> 03:03:00.676]  Go ahead.
[03:03:01.946 --> 03:03:05.908]  Hey, so I guess I'll start off by saying I've been listening to the show a long time.
[03:03:05.908 --> 03:03:06.969]  My dad listens to the show.
[03:03:06.969 --> 03:03:10.471]  We've been big fans for several years now.
[03:03:10.471 --> 03:03:13.873]  But anyways, I'm actually an Umpqua Community College alumni.
[03:03:13.873 --> 03:03:16.394]  I was in the Umpqua Singers Performance Group for a couple of years.
[03:03:16.394 --> 03:03:19.716]  We toured Spain, did a whole bunch of stuff over there, and great time.
[03:03:19.716 --> 03:03:24.118]  But anyways, so I've got a lot of family, a lot of friends that go to Umpqua.
[03:03:24.118 --> 03:03:28.781]  In fact, it's actually called a three-year school because of the fine and performing arts field.
[03:03:28.781 --> 03:03:29.321]  But anyways, so
[03:03:31.877 --> 03:03:33.778]  The thing that catches me is a few things.
[03:03:33.778 --> 03:03:39.502]  One thing, during the attack, I talked to my mom, who was under a table at the time.
[03:03:39.502 --> 03:03:46.027]  She was in the cafeteria, which is also the main administration registry building, that kind of thing.
[03:03:46.027 --> 03:03:54.232]  And so I'm talking to her, and she goes, yeah, they took down the first shooter, and we're waiting for them to take down the second shooter.
[03:03:54.232 --> 03:03:59.216]  And a lot of my friends have sent me texts that say, yeah, we're waiting for them to take down the second shooter.
[03:04:01.276 --> 03:04:10.044]  Yeah, that kind of stuff happens a lot, and I'm not going to say this was staged, but they were going to stage, you know, fake hijackings.
[03:04:10.044 --> 03:04:11.345]  They've been caught staging other stuff.
[03:04:11.345 --> 03:04:18.011]  They staged Fast and Furious, so they're 100% absolutely capable of staging this.
[03:04:18.011 --> 03:04:25.998]  But it doesn't matter because no amount of mass shootings is our fault as gun owners, and they're going to have to really stage a lot of them to get the numbers up because it's still not above 200 a year.
[03:04:27.560 --> 03:04:28.482]  And so it's a tragedy.
[03:04:28.482 --> 03:04:35.919]  I'm sorry for those that got killed, but it's nothing compared to 300,000 killed by our criminal government funding al-Qaeda in Syria and was upwards of 100,000 in Libya.
[03:04:37.714 --> 03:04:38.495]  Good job, Matthew.
[03:04:38.495 --> 03:04:39.155]  Appreciate you.
[03:04:39.155 --> 03:04:40.456]  By the way, I didn't even mention that.
[03:04:40.456 --> 03:04:41.056]  Yes, the U.N.
[03:04:41.056 --> 03:04:43.117]  is going to take over your local police departments.
[03:04:43.117 --> 03:04:46.559]  Dean wanted to talk about that, but Paul Watson can go to him.
[03:04:46.559 --> 03:04:46.840]  U.N.
[03:04:46.840 --> 03:04:51.582]  take over your local governments and actually have them go around and spy on you for your political action.
[03:04:51.582 --> 03:04:52.523]  It's part of a new U.N.
[03:04:52.523 --> 03:04:53.604]  police force.
[03:04:53.604 --> 03:04:56.045]  You can go to the Justice Department and read the Attorney General talking about it.
[03:04:56.045 --> 03:04:56.586]  I mean, this is real.
[03:04:59.264 --> 03:05:01.425]  Kit Daniels, Infowars.com.
[03:05:01.425 --> 03:05:06.146]  CNN reportedly altered the photo of the biracial organ shooter to make him look more white.
[03:05:06.146 --> 03:05:08.827]  That's a shocking revelation, so let me repeat that.
[03:05:08.827 --> 03:05:14.589]  CNN apparently doctored the photo of the biracial organ shooter, Christopher Mercer, to make people think he's Caucasian.
[03:05:14.589 --> 03:05:23.332]  Mercer uploaded a selfie to his social media, but when CNN used the photo in its news broadcast, Mercer's skin tone had dramatically changed to that of a white man.
[03:05:23.332 --> 03:05:27.633]  Furthermore, CNN did not show photos of Mercer's mother, who is African American.
[03:05:27.833 --> 03:05:33.876]  And the network also didn't report that Mercer was involved in a school play, which contradicts the media's claim that he was a loner.
[03:05:33.876 --> 03:05:34.917]  Why would they do that?
[03:05:34.917 --> 03:05:41.240]  Because a biracial Oregon shooter does not fit into the establishment's propaganda that mass shooters are white racist men.
[03:05:41.240 --> 03:05:48.864]  They also don't want you to know that Mercer was associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, because it would be a political nightmare for Obama if the public knew the truth.
[03:05:48.864 --> 03:05:55.227]  It'd be hard for him to demand more gun control if more people started to realize that President Obama is fueling racial division across the U.S.
[03:05:55.487 --> 03:05:58.990]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:05:58.990 --> 03:06:04.134]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.

[03:06:26.947 --> 03:06:33.289]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[03:06:33.289 --> 03:06:37.449]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.
[03:06:37.449 --> 03:06:42.390]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[03:06:42.390 --> 03:06:47.051]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.

[03:06:53.975 --> 03:06:58.618]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:06:58.618 --> 03:07:02.922]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[03:07:02.922 --> 03:07:07.185]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[03:07:07.185 --> 03:07:14.451]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[03:07:14.631 --> 03:07:25.296]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[03:07:25.296 --> 03:07:28.817]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[03:07:28.817 --> 03:07:29.938]  What do you have to lose?
[03:07:29.938 --> 03:07:32.659]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and
[03:07:32.779 --> 03:07:38.381]  You're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[03:07:38.381 --> 03:07:41.682]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[03:07:41.682 --> 03:07:45.883]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[03:07:45.883 --> 03:07:48.184]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[03:07:48.184 --> 03:07:55.146]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:08:01.866 --> 03:08:08.508]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:08.508 --> 03:08:15.511]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:15.511 --> 03:08:19.972]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:19.972 --> 03:08:21.313]  It's the fourth hour overdrive.
[03:08:21.313 --> 03:08:22.873]  I'm your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:08:22.873 --> 03:08:25.534]  We've got a ton of news coming up over the next hour.
[03:08:25.534 --> 03:08:30.656]  We've also got David Knight popping in at the end of the hour to preview the InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:08:31.505 --> 03:08:53.020]  We're going to play a video, probably in the next segment or this segment, out of a migrant camp in Europe where one of the refugees is complaining about the fact that he doesn't get sex and that he had to stay in a taxpayer-funded hospital for three days because of his failure to get sex gave him blue balls.
[03:08:53.020 --> 03:08:54.001]  That's right, it's going to get
[03:08:54.349 --> 03:09:06.937]  Pretty graphic in this hour, so if there are young children watching, you might want to turn down the volume because we're going to delve into some pretty graphic and disgusting issues, as you would expect.
[03:09:06.937 --> 03:09:16.583]  From the progressive left, we're going to get into the woman who made herself deliberately blind by pouring drain cleaner in her eyes.
[03:09:17.168 --> 03:09:21.331]  And how that was treated by the media coverage of the issue.
[03:09:21.331 --> 03:09:29.156]  This is completely bizarre, but it's par for the course of what we've come to expect from progressives and social justice warriors.
[03:09:29.156 --> 03:09:33.539]  We're going to get to your calls probably in the next half hour as well.
[03:09:33.539 --> 03:09:37.622]  Wanted to start off with Russia, because of course we've had over the past week
[03:09:38.376 --> 03:09:41.859]  Basically Russia has decimated ISIS in many areas.
[03:09:41.859 --> 03:09:48.924]  It took them a week to better what it took NATO and the US to do in seven months.
[03:09:48.924 --> 03:09:54.889]  Seven months of bombing ISIS in Syria and Russia has basically already beaten that.
[03:09:54.889 --> 03:10:06.598]  So now NATO, and this is breaking news up on the BBC News website, NATO is incredibly butthurt about the fact that Russia is actually killing terrorists in Syria.
[03:10:07.574 --> 03:10:09.556]  And we know why that is.
[03:10:09.556 --> 03:10:14.640]  Because ISIS has the same agenda as NATO and the US.
[03:10:14.640 --> 03:10:18.243]  They want to topple Bashar al-Assad.
[03:10:18.243 --> 03:10:19.765]  Russia has a different agenda.
[03:10:19.765 --> 03:10:31.895]  They want to maintain Assad in power and they actually want to kill ISIS terrorists, God forbid, which is why they're being demonized in the media and from the White House and NATO over the past week.
[03:10:31.895 --> 03:10:35.258]  So BBC News reports, Syria conflict
[03:10:35.740 --> 03:10:38.302]  NATO warns Russia on airstrikes.
[03:10:38.302 --> 03:10:41.564]  This is a breaking news which went up about an hour ago.
[03:10:41.564 --> 03:10:52.431]  NATO has urged Russia to end airstrikes, quote, on the Syrian opposition and civilians, days after Moscow began raids to support Syria's government.
[03:10:52.431 --> 03:10:54.833]  Okay, let's get this straight.
[03:10:54.833 --> 03:10:56.774]  Syrian opposition.
[03:10:56.774 --> 03:11:04.880]  Okay, the US spent $500 million to train these so-called moderate Syrian rebels.
[03:11:05.774 --> 03:11:15.936]  It came out, and this is a Guardian report, US has trained only four or five Syrian fighters against ISIS, top general testifies.
[03:11:15.936 --> 03:11:30.679]  So, General Lloyd Austin, of course, it was now a few weeks ago, testified that this $500 million program to train the moderate rebels has resulted in only four or five actual moderate rebels
[03:11:31.226 --> 03:11:41.689]  That are not jihadists, that are not going to hand their weapons over to ISIS, that are not going to join Al-Qaeda affiliated groups in Syria the first chance they get.
[03:11:41.689 --> 03:11:52.513]  Which is what happened to the vast majority of all the other moderate, quote, moderate rebels that the US and NATO have been backing for the past three, four years.
[03:11:52.513 --> 03:11:59.995]  So that's why the US and NATO are incredibly butthurt about the fact that Russia is killing ISIS terrorists.
[03:12:01.261 --> 03:12:06.045]  ISIS wants to topple Bashar al-Assad, as does the US and NATO.
[03:12:06.045 --> 03:12:10.969]  So now they're basically threatening Russia to end the airstrikes.
[03:12:10.969 --> 03:12:23.659]  The article continues, Moscow says it is targeting Islamic State and other Islamist positions, but US-led allies and Turkey say government opponents are targeted.
[03:12:23.659 --> 03:12:24.220]  Bear in mind,
[03:12:24.912 --> 03:12:34.475]  This is the same Turkish government and military that has been bombing the Kurds in Iraq, who have been fighting ISIS.
[03:12:34.475 --> 03:12:52.422]  So again, NATO and Turkey are actually targeting the people who are fighting ISIS, whilst supporting these, quote, moderate rebels, who aren't moderate at all, they're jihadists, who are handing over their weapons to ISIS, to these al-Qaeda affiliated groups, like Jabhat al-Nusra, and in many cases,
[03:12:52.830 --> 03:12:54.810]  Defecting to them as well.
[03:12:54.810 --> 03:13:02.412]  Russia comes along in a week, obliterates all these key command centres, these key ISIS command centres.
[03:13:02.412 --> 03:13:03.692]  But we can't have that, can we?
[03:13:03.692 --> 03:13:04.912]  Oh no, Russia's bad.
[03:13:04.912 --> 03:13:09.833]  Russia's the bad guy now, but actually trying to kill ISIS terrorists.
[03:13:09.833 --> 03:13:20.795]  And if you look at the actual numbers, we've had articles before on Infowars about these ISIS jihadists miraculously discovering huge weapons caches dropped by
[03:13:21.553 --> 03:13:22.954]  The US military.
[03:13:22.954 --> 03:13:35.341]  And then you look, you drill down into the actual statistics, the US has dropped 43 bombs on ISIS per day since the campaign began, which was about seven months ago.
[03:13:35.341 --> 03:13:37.922]  Compare that to 1991, the Iraq War, the first Gulf War.
[03:13:37.922 --> 03:13:40.244]  6,163 bombs dropped per day in comparison to 43 in the supposed
[03:13:49.775 --> 03:13:55.457]  War on ISIS, the airstrikes on ISIS that were launched by the US and NATO seven months ago.
[03:13:55.457 --> 03:13:58.919]  So they're obviously not targeting ISIS.
[03:13:58.919 --> 03:14:14.685]  There are reports of ISIS getting a heads up, getting a warning before these airstrikes happen and fleeing to a different location, which is why Obama's plan to degrade ISIS has been a complete failure for the past seven months.
[03:14:14.685 --> 03:14:16.126]  They've only grown in strength.
[03:14:16.126 --> 03:14:17.766]  They've only gained more territory.
[03:14:17.766 --> 03:14:19.007]  They've lost some territory.
[03:14:19.440 --> 03:14:22.121]  In some areas, gained it in others.
[03:14:22.121 --> 03:14:29.324]  Then Putin comes along in a week, and basically just obliterates dozens of ISIS command centers.
[03:14:29.324 --> 03:14:40.809]  And NATO and the US are not happy about it, because they trained these moderate rebels who handed over the weapons to ISIS because they know they share the same agenda, which is to topple Assad.
[03:14:40.809 --> 03:14:46.131]  And also impose a no-fly zone over Syria, which is why they're opposing this Russian
[03:14:47.028 --> 03:15:05.915]  war plan, these Russian airstrikes, because it's obsessing the agenda to impose this no-fly zone, which of course is key to controlling the country and eventually to bombing actual Syrian government positions and taking out President Bashar al-Assad, which has been the agenda all along.
[03:15:05.915 --> 03:15:15.079]  And what's amazing about it is they lectured Russia for a week, the whole of last week, they lectured Russia about
[03:15:16.021 --> 03:15:19.902]  The fact that they were, quote, targeting civilians and opposition forces.
[03:15:19.902 --> 03:15:22.263]  Turned out that was completely fake.
[03:15:22.263 --> 03:15:25.984]  It was a Soros-sponsored group called White Helmets.
[03:15:25.984 --> 03:15:37.286]  They released an image of this jihadist, this, quote, moderate rebel, with a child in his arms, bloody, bruised, potentially dead.
[03:15:37.286 --> 03:15:41.207]  And basically they said, this is a result of Russian airstrikes.
[03:15:41.207 --> 03:15:43.828]  Turns out, the photo was about a week old,
[03:15:44.502 --> 03:15:59.285]  The casualty was a result of Syrian government airstrikes, but they faked it and blamed it on Russia so they could have this whole narrative in the media that these Russian airstrikes, which are killing ISIS terrorists, are in fact killing civilians.
[03:15:59.285 --> 03:16:11.788]  And isn't it amazing that the mainstream media suddenly develops this, you know, deep compassion for civilian victims of airstrikes, which has been completely absent for the past 15 years or so.
[03:16:11.788 --> 03:16:12.968]  What made it even more
[03:16:13.991 --> 03:16:22.377]  Darkly ironic is the fact that on Saturday in Afghanistan the US bombed a hospital and killed 19 people.
[03:16:22.377 --> 03:16:37.569]  So again, lecturing Russia all week about them killing civilians and then on Saturday there's a US airstrike that kills 19 civilians at least in this hospital in Afghanistan.
[03:16:37.569 --> 03:16:40.071]  So again, complete hypocrisy on the media narrative.
[03:16:40.908 --> 03:16:47.032]  And they're desperate to stop these Russian airstrikes because they're actually having an impact and killing ISIS.
[03:16:47.032 --> 03:16:49.234]  Which the US and NATO don't want.
[03:16:49.234 --> 03:16:55.738]  They want ISIS to remain in the region because their goal, their endgame, is not to destroy ISIS.
[03:16:55.738 --> 03:16:58.940]  It's to topple President Bashar al-Assad.
[03:16:58.940 --> 03:17:01.982]  And of course that goal is shared by ISIS.
[03:17:01.982 --> 03:17:08.627]  So it's in their interest to keep them in the region and that's why the offensive against ISIS has been so weak.
[03:17:08.627 --> 03:17:10.768]  Russia comes along and completely obliterates it.
[03:17:11.738 --> 03:17:34.473]  Then you've got this whole narrative about, you know, you had McCain last week come out and say, we should arm the Syrian rebels to take out Russian fighter jets because we did it in Afghanistan and it was such a success, it didn't lead to the rise of the Taliban, it didn't lead to the rise of Al-Qaeda, it didn't lead to the rise of Osama Bin Laden and 9-11.
[03:17:34.473 --> 03:17:37.835]  No, it was a complete success and that's what we should do again.
[03:17:37.835 --> 03:17:38.776]  So that's, again,
[03:17:39.636 --> 03:17:42.418]  They're trying to create a provocation.
[03:17:42.418 --> 03:17:51.766]  Now if you remember back in 2003, this leaked memo before the Iraq war when they were trying to find a justification for the Iraq war.
[03:17:51.766 --> 03:17:56.530]  The whole weapons of mass destruction narrative was failing.
[03:17:56.530 --> 03:17:59.632]  31st of January 2003 we had this memo.
[03:17:59.632 --> 03:18:02.835]  Confidential memo reveals US plans to provoke an invasion of Iraq.
[03:18:03.410 --> 03:18:14.076]  Quote, this is a Guardian article, Bush told Blair the US had drawn up a provocative plan to fly U-2 reconnaissance aircraft painted in UN colours over Iraq with fighter cover.
[03:18:14.076 --> 03:18:21.359]  Bush said that if Saddam fired at the planes, this would put the Iraqi leader in breach of UN resolutions.
[03:18:21.359 --> 03:18:23.421]  So there was a plan on record.
[03:18:23.421 --> 03:18:27.923]  It was never put into action, but there was a plan to fake a shoot-down
[03:18:28.396 --> 03:18:34.219]  of a U-2 plane over Iraq to blame it on Saddam Hussein and create a pretext for the invasion.
[03:18:34.219 --> 03:18:40.562]  Over the past few days, we've had these Russian fighter jets almost collide with Israeli jets.
[03:18:40.562 --> 03:18:43.023]  We've had them go into Turkish territory.
[03:18:43.023 --> 03:18:46.745]  Turkey turns them back, these Russian fighter jets.
[03:18:46.745 --> 03:18:52.348]  And basically they're saying that Turkey would have had the right to shoot down those Russian fighter jets.
[03:18:52.348 --> 03:18:54.729]  Again, echoing John McCain's rhetoric
[03:18:56.104 --> 03:18:59.486]  That we should arm these individuals to shoot down these Russian fighter jets.
[03:18:59.486 --> 03:19:01.268]  So they're trying to create a precedent.
[03:19:01.268 --> 03:19:03.649]  They're trying to create a provocation.
[03:19:03.649 --> 03:19:05.831]  And I'm not saying this is going to happen.
[03:19:05.831 --> 03:19:21.922]  But it could be that they would stage a kind of collision, a mid-air collision, between maybe Israeli and Turkish fighter jets to blame it on Russia as a pretext to go to the UN and say, these Russian airstrikes on ISIS need to stop.
[03:19:21.922 --> 03:19:25.625]  Even though they're not killing civilians, no evidence of that, they're taking out
[03:19:26.144 --> 03:19:32.169]  ISIS command centers and they're having a massive impact, but they don't like that.
[03:19:32.169 --> 03:19:43.017]  So I think there could be some kind of provocation on the score of this UN plan back in 2003 to create this false reason to invade Iraq.
[03:19:43.017 --> 03:19:45.158]  They could go with that narrative once again.
[03:19:45.158 --> 03:19:47.160]  That's what it seems to be building up to.
[03:19:47.160 --> 03:19:50.082]  We'll explore that and more after the break.
[03:19:50.082 --> 03:19:51.923]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[03:19:51.923 --> 03:19:53.244]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:19:53.244 --> 03:19:53.705]  Stay tuned.
[03:19:59.691 --> 03:20:10.765]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens that often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.
[03:20:10.765 --> 03:20:14.510]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[03:22:58.622 --> 03:23:03.044]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[03:23:03.044 --> 03:23:07.105]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[03:23:07.105 --> 03:23:11.427]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[03:23:14.468 --> 03:23:19.712]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[03:23:19.712 --> 03:23:28.418]  If you want to boost your Omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.

[03:24:16.284 --> 03:24:17.545]  We're back live.
[03:24:17.545 --> 03:24:19.606]  It's the Alex Jones Show 4-Hour Overdrive.
[03:24:19.606 --> 03:24:21.347]  I'm your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:24:21.347 --> 03:24:28.352]  We've got Jacori Jackson coming up in a second with a news update, but I just want to direct you to the Infowars store, of course.
[03:24:28.352 --> 03:24:30.573]  This is how we operate with your support.
[03:24:30.573 --> 03:24:32.955]  We're not funded by George Soros.
[03:24:32.955 --> 03:24:34.936]  We're not funded by the US government.
[03:24:34.936 --> 03:24:36.457]  We're not funded by NGOs.
[03:24:36.457 --> 03:24:43.242]  We're not funded by anyone other than you buying the products, getting the subscriptions, and that has allowed us to expand
[03:24:43.852 --> 03:24:52.434]  Over the past 10-15 years, to the point where we're now, challenging the mainstream media narrative and having a massive impact on a number of issues.
[03:24:52.434 --> 03:24:54.255]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:24:54.255 --> 03:24:59.476]  Liver Shield is back in stock and it's on sale at £29.95.
[03:24:59.476 --> 03:25:05.678]  An enhanced blend of powerful herbs that support normal cleansing and function of the lidder and gallbladder.
[03:25:05.678 --> 03:25:07.938]  So that's InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:25:07.938 --> 03:25:10.439]  Also, Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.
[03:25:11.081 --> 03:25:14.365]  Again, $30 saving on that product.
[03:25:14.365 --> 03:25:15.046]  It's in stock.
[03:25:15.046 --> 03:25:16.547]  It's available right now.
[03:25:16.547 --> 03:25:21.753]  With excellent third-party reviews, you can go and check out what the people have said about these products.
[03:25:21.753 --> 03:25:23.054]  We don't write those reviews.
[03:25:23.054 --> 03:25:27.860]  Those are people who buy the products, use them for themselves, and get massive benefit out of them.
[03:25:28.510 --> 03:25:33.377]  Survival Shield, X2, Nascent, Iodine, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:25:33.377 --> 03:25:40.487]  Help support the broadcast, help us grow and take on the mainstream media in the Info War.
[03:25:40.487 --> 03:25:43.231]  Jakari Jackson, you've got some news updates there.
[03:25:43.231 --> 03:25:43.992]  Go ahead, Jakari.
[03:25:44.841 --> 03:25:45.642]  Thank you, Paul.
[03:25:45.642 --> 03:25:48.404]  Jakari Jackson back here in the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:25:48.404 --> 03:25:52.868]  We're going to look at some of the top articles on InfoWars.com.
[03:25:52.868 --> 03:25:53.569]  We'll start with this.
[03:25:53.569 --> 03:25:57.272]  Texas top cop, ISIS may be infiltrating border.
[03:25:57.272 --> 03:25:59.534]  This is a great article by Adan Salazar.
[03:26:00.154 --> 03:26:04.740]  And we spent a lot of time on the Texas border over the past, I guess, year and a half now.
[03:26:04.740 --> 03:26:09.986]  Myself and Adan, we were down there last year and we were talking to ICE agents, Border Patrol agents.
[03:26:09.986 --> 03:26:14.731]  They say, yes, we do have people coming over the border, whether they're MS-13 or ISIS.
[03:26:14.731 --> 03:26:20.158]  In the case of this article, we see various reports of people, MS-13, going to other parts of the country.
[03:26:20.618 --> 03:26:25.782]  And just goes to show that not everybody coming into the country is from Central or South America.
[03:26:25.782 --> 03:26:30.144]  You have people coming in from all over the world, some people with very legitimate reasons.
[03:26:30.144 --> 03:26:32.346]  You know, they're worried about the violence in Syria.
[03:26:32.346 --> 03:26:36.609]  They're worried about the drug war in Mexico or failed drug war, as it may be.
[03:26:36.609 --> 03:26:39.451]  So some people have very legitimate concerns for coming here.
[03:26:39.451 --> 03:26:42.453]  But they also have to realize that it's a lot of U.S.
[03:26:42.453 --> 03:26:45.154]  intervention that are making some of these situations worse.
[03:26:45.154 --> 03:26:50.078]  Case in point, the drug cartels getting their weapons from Fast and Furious and also
[03:26:50.958 --> 03:26:56.303]  Isis and other people having things airdropped courtesy of the Obama and Western-backed governments.
[03:26:56.303 --> 03:27:02.287]  Going now to PC police want to ban ham sandwiches because Muslims might find them offensive.
[03:27:02.287 --> 03:27:03.828]  That by Kit Daniels.
[03:27:03.828 --> 03:27:13.576]  Now this is just another in a string of stories we've seen previously people trying to ban peanut butter and jelly sandwiches because in some countries they don't eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
[03:27:13.576 --> 03:27:16.679]  It's just the PC police gone completely out of control.
[03:27:16.679 --> 03:27:19.241]  They say you can't wear American flag shirts, you can't have
[03:27:19.921 --> 03:27:20.181]  I don't know.
[03:27:37.046 --> 03:27:37.266]  No, I don't.
[03:27:57.597 --> 03:27:57.697]  It's
[03:28:15.936 --> 03:28:16.236]  I think so.
[03:28:37.583 --> 03:28:41.846]  And I guess it's the South Lawn, but there's a big park in front of the White House.
[03:28:41.846 --> 03:28:44.048]  You have the White House bench, you have a big park out there.
[03:28:44.048 --> 03:28:51.533]  There are homeless people that sleep in front of the White House in the United States of America in 2015 during the Obama administration.
[03:28:51.533 --> 03:28:56.536]  You don't see them so much during the daytime because they always kick them out because you can't be there when Obama walks outside.
[03:28:56.536 --> 03:28:58.597]  But if you go there at night, you'll see them sleep on the bench.
[03:28:58.597 --> 03:29:06.243]  So if you want to talk about humanitarian intervention, why don't you just walk outside and give those people a job or let them stay in your lavish house?
[03:29:06.983 --> 03:29:10.905]  And we have things on the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal has been reached.
[03:29:10.905 --> 03:29:12.606]  Great article by Kurt Nemo.
[03:29:12.606 --> 03:29:16.267]  Now David Knight is going to be hosting the InfoWars Nightly News tonight.
[03:29:16.267 --> 03:29:21.790]  He has documented the TPP in such detail, so definitely stay tuned for that.
[03:29:21.790 --> 03:29:23.871]  I'm sure he will get all into that.
[03:29:23.871 --> 03:29:28.693]  And also a lesbian Swedish bishop wants Christian crosses removed from churches to please Muslims.
[03:29:29.353 --> 03:29:31.073]  This is completely ridiculous.
[03:29:31.073 --> 03:29:36.754]  This, along with some of the recent statements that the Pope has made, not so much about lesbians, but some other things that he's mentioned.
[03:29:36.754 --> 03:29:42.115]  Just people who are supposedly supposed to be pushing the Christian faith are doing everything but that.
[03:29:42.115 --> 03:29:42.656]  Stay tuned.
[03:29:42.656 --> 03:29:44.976]  This is the Infowars Overdrive Hour.
[03:29:44.976 --> 03:29:48.497]  Jakari Jackson along with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:29:48.497 --> 03:29:49.897]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.897 --> 03:29:51.497]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.497 --> 03:29:55.098]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.423 --> 03:30:01.485]  Kit Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[03:30:01.485 --> 03:30:05.287]  President Obama implied that the federal government should confiscate all guns.
[03:30:05.287 --> 03:30:06.028]  That's right.
[03:30:06.028 --> 03:30:11.251]  The president responsible for the deaths of women and children via drone strikes is now trying to eradicate the Second Amendment.
[03:30:11.251 --> 03:30:21.939]  When Obama responded to the October 1st attack on an Oregon community college, he went beyond his usual demand for more gun control and suggested that America should consider outright banning guns just like Australia and Great Britain.
[03:30:22.159 --> 03:30:30.804]  But it's hypocritical for Obama to demand that Americans turn in their guns when, according to the Pentagon, the Obama administration is backing ISIS in its war against the Syrian government.
[03:30:30.804 --> 03:30:36.347]  In fact, in September 2013, President Obama waived a federal law specifically designed to keep the U.S.
[03:30:36.347 --> 03:30:39.509]  government from supplying firearms to terrorist groups such as ISIS.
[03:30:39.509 --> 03:30:43.231]  On the very same day, he demanded more gun control in response to the D.C.
[03:30:43.231 --> 03:30:43.992]  Navy Yard shooting.
[03:30:44.312 --> 03:30:51.801]  In other words, Obama is shipping guns to Islamic militants, aka moderate rebels, while simultaneously trying to disarm American citizens.
[03:30:51.801 --> 03:30:58.769]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and check out our new YouTube channel called Resistance News.
[03:30:59.189 --> 03:31:04.931]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[03:31:04.931 --> 03:31:19.396]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[03:31:19.636 --> 03:31:27.643]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[03:31:27.643 --> 03:31:33.227]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[03:31:33.227 --> 03:31:36.770]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[03:31:36.770 --> 03:31:40.914]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[03:31:40.914 --> 03:31:44.737]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[03:31:45.217 --> 03:31:49.342]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.
[03:31:49.342 --> 03:31:54.407]  Secure your Liver Shield today exclusively at Infowarslife.com for the lowest price available.
[03:31:54.407 --> 03:31:57.871]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:31:57.871 --> 03:32:02.496]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:32:02.496 --> 03:32:07.341]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[03:32:07.421 --> 03:32:07.741]  I don't know.
[03:32:28.880 --> 03:32:30.001]  BrainForce is here.
[03:32:30.001 --> 03:32:32.202]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:32:32.202 --> 03:32:37.186]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[03:32:37.186 --> 03:32:38.907]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[03:32:38.907 --> 03:32:40.488]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:32:40.488 --> 03:32:43.971]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:32:43.971 --> 03:32:45.952]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:32:45.952 --> 03:32:46.873]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[03:32:46.873 --> 03:32:48.054]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:32:48.054 --> 03:32:50.075]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[03:32:50.075 --> 03:32:55.579]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:33:00.560 --> 03:33:05.975]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:05.975 --> 03:33:08.262]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:33:15.134 --> 03:33:20.357]  Black Lives Matter, four hour overdrive of the Alex Jones Show with me, your host, Paul Judds of Fox News.
[03:33:20.357 --> 03:33:29.683]  Now the migrant crisis has kind of slipped behind the scenes over the past couple of weeks in terms of mainstream media coverage, but it still continues to rage.
[03:33:29.683 --> 03:33:37.347]  We've got reports about 900,000 migrants coming into Germany before the end of the year, a total of 1.5 million for the year.
[03:33:40.549 --> 03:33:47.311]  Now we featured videos about the behaviour of some of these migrants which isn't being showcased by the media.
[03:33:47.311 --> 03:33:56.393]  Of course we've had the clapping Germans as they arrive, you know, Dutch people singing songs, they're all welcoming, they're rolling out the red carpet.
[03:33:56.393 --> 03:34:01.755]  And then you look at the actual videos of what's going on and the reports of what are coming out of these migrant camps.
[03:34:02.555 --> 03:34:04.736]  And it's disturbing to say the least.
[03:34:04.736 --> 03:34:21.223]  And it's not being covered by media, by mainstream media, which is why one of the videos I made about it got 1.8 million views, because there's a thirst for this knowledge, because people just aren't seeing it on the likes of, you know, ABC, CBS, Fox News and BBC News.
[03:34:21.223 --> 03:34:23.444]  It's all being completely positive.
[03:34:23.444 --> 03:34:28.507]  This is going to have a wonderful impact on our culture and society once we welcome these people in.
[03:34:29.147 --> 03:34:36.914]  Well, take a listen to what one migrant said outside a, quote, refugee camp in Europe.
[03:34:36.914 --> 03:34:38.455]  Here's the clip.
[03:34:38.455 --> 03:34:41.938]  Doctor, say, make this.
[03:34:41.938 --> 03:34:44.020]  I sleep three days in hospital.
[03:34:44.020 --> 03:34:46.882]  Because there's a problem.
[03:34:46.882 --> 03:34:48.864]  What's the problem?
[03:34:48.864 --> 03:34:51.186]  Problem, problem, problem here.
[03:34:51.186 --> 03:34:51.606]  Here.
[03:34:51.606 --> 03:34:53.428]  Problem there?
[03:34:53.428 --> 03:34:54.249]  Exactly.
[03:34:54.249 --> 03:34:55.470]  It's very big.
[03:34:56.269 --> 03:34:57.470]  Like this.
[03:34:57.470 --> 03:34:58.791]  It's deep.
[03:34:58.791 --> 03:35:00.452]  Really.
[03:35:00.452 --> 03:35:02.994]  He said make sex with anyone.
[03:35:02.994 --> 03:35:03.935]  Or make anything.
[03:35:03.935 --> 03:35:05.716]  We are 400 people, okay?
[03:35:05.716 --> 03:35:09.079]  How I can bring the girl to here, okay?
[03:35:09.079 --> 03:35:14.263]  She go like bring... She go like make 400 times sex.
[03:35:14.263 --> 03:35:14.523]  Shit.
[03:35:15.578 --> 03:35:23.660]  So the first guy in that clip basically was pointing to his groin and saying that he had blue balls.
[03:35:23.660 --> 03:35:24.600]  He was in prison.
[03:35:24.600 --> 03:35:35.002]  He was in a hospital, a taxpayer-funded hospital, for three days with blue balls because there was no one to have sex with at this migrant camp.
[03:35:35.002 --> 03:35:42.223]  So again, the narrative is they're fleeing war, they're fleeing ISIS persecution, they're starving, they're desperate.
[03:35:42.603 --> 03:35:46.044]  And yes, in some cases they are, but it's a minority.
[03:35:46.044 --> 03:35:51.546]  You know, only one-fifth of these so-called migrants are actually Syrian refugees.
[03:35:51.546 --> 03:35:56.008]  The rest of them are fleeing to a higher standard of living.
[03:35:56.008 --> 03:35:58.529]  72% of them are men, according to the UN's own figures.
[03:35:59.329 --> 03:36:06.934]  And so now we're seeing all these videos of these mostly men outside migrant camps in Europe complaining.
[03:36:06.934 --> 03:36:20.202]  We had another video which is embedded in the Infowars article which is up there right now about this video migrant complains about lack of sex in refugee camp where it's a refugee camp in the Netherlands and they're complaining about
[03:36:21.122 --> 03:36:29.053]  Slow internet connections, lack of being given money for cigarettes and adequate food.
[03:36:29.053 --> 03:36:34.320]  So these are the concerns of these migrants who are supposedly fleeing ISIS persecution.
[03:36:34.320 --> 03:36:36.463]  Of course, they're not Syrian refugees.
[03:36:36.463 --> 03:36:38.305]  They're fleeing to a higher standard of living.
[03:36:39.420 --> 03:36:42.663]  And now they're complaining about not having enough sex.
[03:36:42.663 --> 03:36:56.154]  Well, that isn't a problem for some of the migrants in Germany, and we've reported on this before, who are forcing women and underage girls, children, into prostitution in these migrant camps.
[03:36:56.154 --> 03:37:03.480]  In fact, three top social organisations in Germany just a few weeks ago came out with this huge letter
[03:37:04.349 --> 03:37:09.893]  Warning the German government, basically, that this activity was going on in these migrant camps.
[03:37:09.893 --> 03:37:13.916]  The people in charge of the camps were doing absolutely nothing about it.
[03:37:13.916 --> 03:37:18.159]  In fact, some of them were complicit, being paid off to allow this to happen.
[03:37:18.159 --> 03:37:24.403]  So migrant women and children being raped by these men in these migrant camps.
[03:37:24.403 --> 03:37:29.847]  They're not having any problems getting sex and the German government is covering it up.
[03:37:29.847 --> 03:37:32.269]  They're covering it up with Facebook censorship
[03:37:32.609 --> 03:37:46.493]  Mark Zuckerberg, who of course is an expert at censorship given his close ties to the Communist Chinese government, is now working with Merkel, with the German government, and with ex-Stasi officials.
[03:37:46.493 --> 03:37:47.654]  That's confirmed.
[03:37:47.654 --> 03:37:54.956]  The very group in East Germany that spied on, hunted down political dissidents, now
[03:37:55.436 --> 03:38:05.982]  An ex-agent in that very organisation is working with Zuckerberg and the German government to go after people who make, quote, anti-migrant comments on Facebook.
[03:38:05.982 --> 03:38:08.764]  They're being threatened with dismissal from their jobs.
[03:38:08.764 --> 03:38:16.788]  In extreme cases, they're being threatened with their children being taken away, simply for making anti-migrant comments.
[03:38:16.788 --> 03:38:19.030]  And then the police in many areas in Germany
[03:38:19.930 --> 03:38:29.318]  And now not reporting these rape cases, which are impacting not just migrant children and women, but Germans living in the local area near these migrant camps.
[03:38:29.318 --> 03:38:36.964]  The German police are covering up these cases so as not to, quote, legitimize right-wing demonstrators.
[03:38:36.964 --> 03:38:44.249]  Because now we're finally seeing an uprising in Germany with all these protest groups finally speaking out against this.
[03:38:44.249 --> 03:38:46.431]  And they don't want that narrative to be out there.
[03:38:46.431 --> 03:38:48.393]  So they're covering up these rape cases.
[03:38:49.349 --> 03:38:53.511]  The Gatestone Institute, we featured this article, listed a bunch of them.
[03:38:53.511 --> 03:39:04.918]  We also had a recent video featured on Infowars.com where it was this Arabic-speaking woman who got on a train in Budapest, which of course is where many of these immigrants come into before they head to Germany.
[03:39:06.078 --> 03:39:25.774]  She was Arabic-speaking, she lived in the Middle East for a number of years, and basically she listened to the conversations that these migrants were having on the train, you know, as they cast away food and rob people in train stations, as we've had the videos, we've shown the videos, and they were basically talking about taking her hostage and raping her.
[03:39:26.707 --> 03:39:33.995]  So this is the kind of culture, and again this is not all the migrants, this is not all the refugees, but it's a sizeable portion of them.
[03:39:33.995 --> 03:39:37.539]  This is the culture that we're importing into the West.
[03:39:37.539 --> 03:39:42.504]  And now Chancellor Merkel says, Lord God send illegal immigrants.
[03:39:42.504 --> 03:39:45.107]  Thank God for the right hordes.
[03:39:46.089 --> 03:39:48.170]  I mean, you know, divine intervention.
[03:39:48.170 --> 03:39:55.111]  We should thank the Lord for this great influx of freedom and cultural understanding and tolerance.
[03:39:55.111 --> 03:40:03.754]  As migrant girls and women, as Germans in those towns are being raped by these individuals, we should bow down and worship Angela Merkel.
[03:40:03.754 --> 03:40:09.315]  And if you say a damn word against it on Facebook, you will be censored, you will be hounded.
[03:40:09.315 --> 03:40:11.536]  And then this, again, we covered this earlier.
[03:40:12.546 --> 03:40:19.415]  Lesbian Swedish Bishop Wants Christian Crosses Removed From Church To Please Muslims.
[03:40:19.415 --> 03:40:22.579]  This is in Stockholm, Sweden.
[03:40:22.579 --> 03:40:26.645]  We talk about Sweden every week almost on the Alex Jones Show because
[03:40:27.586 --> 03:40:31.510]  It's an example of, you know, progressivism gone mad.
[03:40:31.510 --> 03:40:42.440]  Not only are they talking about giving ISIS recruits, returning jihadists who come back to Sweden, taxpayer-funded housing and welfare.
[03:40:42.440 --> 03:40:46.164]  In fact, the head of, quote, anti-Islamophobia in Sweden
[03:40:46.784 --> 03:40:48.885]  went on to join ISIS.
[03:40:48.885 --> 03:40:55.449]  They're telling Swedes, give up your garages to house these migrants that are coming into the country.
[03:40:55.449 --> 03:41:03.174]  And now this top bishop in Sweden, and this is a report out of SVT, which is basically Sweden's national public broadcaster.
[03:41:03.174 --> 03:41:05.475]  It's basically their version of the BBC.
[03:41:06.596 --> 03:41:23.685]  She's calling for this church in Stockholm to remove the crosses, to remove the Christian symbols and make the church more like an airport where they have facilities for Muslims to pray and of course remove all the Christian iconography so as not to upset and offend the Muslims.
[03:41:25.160 --> 03:41:35.522]  She's a woman, as a lesbian, who would be executed in some Muslim countries because of her sexuality, and yet she's rolling out the red carpet.
[03:41:35.522 --> 03:41:46.124]  She's selling out Christianity, just as the Pope has done, and now saying that these crosses, these Christian icons in this church, should be removed completely.
[03:41:46.124 --> 03:41:53.365]  Again, as Robert Spencer writes, this is what a society and a culture in the midst of suicide looks like.
[03:41:54.185 --> 03:41:57.228]  Thankfully, there are some people speaking out against this.
[03:41:57.228 --> 03:42:13.580]  But again, if you want to look at what happens when extreme liberalism runs rampant, you only have to look at Sweden, and that's come more to the fore over the past few weeks and months as a result of this migrant crisis.
[03:42:13.580 --> 03:42:16.062]  Now, talking about progressive insanity,
[03:42:17.922 --> 03:42:23.107]  I wrote this article on Friday night, and we haven't really talked about it too much.
[03:42:23.107 --> 03:42:25.449]  Pouring drain cleaner in your eyes.
[03:42:25.449 --> 03:42:28.232]  The next trendy social justice movement.
[03:42:28.232 --> 03:42:34.057]  This is a woman who claims that she was born with a will to be blind.
[03:42:34.057 --> 03:42:35.699]  To be blind from birth.
[03:42:35.699 --> 03:42:40.783]  And she actually got a psychologist to pour drain cleaner in her eyes.
[03:42:41.704 --> 03:42:48.828]  To help her achieve that great social justice will to be blind, to be completely blind.
[03:42:48.828 --> 03:42:50.709]  Let's go to this clip now.
[03:42:50.709 --> 03:42:54.390]  As extreme as Jewel's case sounds, she is not alone.
[03:42:54.390 --> 03:42:57.712]  Dr. Michael First is a leading expert on the condition.
[03:42:57.712 --> 03:43:00.854]  He even coined the term BIID to describe it.
[03:43:01.744 --> 03:43:07.369]  A lot of people who have this just live with it, but they don't take that step of actually actualizing it.
[03:43:07.369 --> 03:43:14.816]  But a significant minority of people with this have the feeling so strongly that they will go and do something to make it happen.
[03:43:14.816 --> 03:43:18.560]  Our job is to reduce suffering however it's possible.
[03:43:18.560 --> 03:43:20.501]  The question is, what can be done?
[03:43:20.501 --> 03:43:23.624]  People have tried therapy, they've tried medication.
[03:43:23.624 --> 03:43:25.186]  None of those have really been successful.
[03:43:25.606 --> 03:43:38.892]  The ethics of whether it is okay to take a normal person and make them disabled is... I think you could make it an ethical case that if you conceptualize this as treating a condition, then it's okay to do it.
[03:43:38.892 --> 03:43:46.176]  The big fear, of course, is somebody goes ahead and gets an amputation and becomes disabled and then changes their mind.
[03:43:46.176 --> 03:43:54.760]  I'd like to encourage people to do what makes sense to make them feel better, but this is such a drastic move that it's hard to encourage.
[03:43:55.060 --> 03:44:01.328]  Initially apprehensive, Jewel has now told her friends in the blind community about how she took her own sight.
[03:44:01.328 --> 03:44:03.650]  I told her that I didn't care.
[03:44:03.650 --> 03:44:10.238]  That I think there's no resentment for her voluntarily taking her eyesight.
[03:44:10.238 --> 03:44:11.520]  That's not who I am.
[03:44:12.153 --> 03:44:15.694]  I just don't think I've ever known anyone who had that condition.
[03:44:15.694 --> 03:44:23.756]  I think there's a lot understood in the medical community, but I'm sure that by what happened to you, it will be helpful to somebody else.
[03:44:23.756 --> 03:44:24.616]  Hey, Joel!
[03:44:24.616 --> 03:44:25.337]  How's it going?
[03:44:25.337 --> 03:44:26.457]  Oh, hi, Ellen!
[03:44:26.457 --> 03:44:28.958]  Does this affect our friendship at all?
[03:44:28.958 --> 03:44:29.698]  No, actually.
[03:44:29.698 --> 03:44:31.358]  I want to thank you for sharing it with me.
[03:44:31.358 --> 03:44:37.680]  I think it's a really inspiring story, actually, because you've overcome a lot here.
[03:44:37.680 --> 03:44:39.040]  You're a very positive person.
[03:44:39.040 --> 03:44:41.121]  You contribute a lot to the blind community.
[03:44:42.173 --> 03:44:44.674]  It's a really inspiring story.
[03:44:44.674 --> 03:44:46.114]  Did you hear those words?
[03:44:46.114 --> 03:44:50.016]  Pouring drain cleaner in your eyes is really inspiring.
[03:44:50.016 --> 03:44:54.197]  And she's a great representative to the blind community.
[03:44:54.197 --> 03:44:57.718]  Of course, the blind community, they don't want to be blind.
[03:44:57.718 --> 03:45:02.660]  It's a crippling disability that they're afflicted with their entire lives.
[03:45:02.660 --> 03:45:08.702]  Why the hell would this individual be such a great representation, a great idol, a great god to them?
[03:45:08.702 --> 03:45:10.843]  And then listen to what the doctor said.
[03:45:11.323 --> 03:45:15.916]  This is a woman who got a psychologist to pour drain cleaner in her eyes.
[03:45:16.741 --> 03:45:29.109]  And the doctor said, quote, the ethics of whether it is okay to take a normal person and make them disabled, I think you can make an ethical case that if you conceptualize this as treating a condition, then it's okay to do it.
[03:45:29.109 --> 03:45:34.113]  It's okay to get someone to pour drain cleaner in your eyes.
[03:45:34.113 --> 03:45:39.456]  Now, of course, in a sensible world, this woman should be under, you know, psychiatric care.
[03:45:39.456 --> 03:45:44.400]  The psychologist who poured drain cleaner in her eyes to blind her should be in prison.
[03:45:45.020 --> 03:45:47.882]  But that's not how it's being treated.
[03:45:47.882 --> 03:45:59.149]  Dr. Michael Furst, Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at Columbia University, that was the voice you just heard saying it's okay for people to pour drain cleaner in their eyes.
[03:45:59.149 --> 03:46:02.952]  That is the level of insanity that this has got to.
[03:46:02.952 --> 03:46:04.833]  Because she was born that way.
[03:46:05.433 --> 03:46:11.319]  You know, I'm not comparing directly transgender people, but that was the same argument we heard.
[03:46:11.319 --> 03:46:12.500]  And this is the way it's going.
[03:46:12.500 --> 03:46:21.968]  We've talked about, you know, paedophile rights being increasingly mainstreamed, and now they're talking about this woman being an inspiration.
[03:46:21.968 --> 03:46:28.855]  I guess she's, you know, stunning and brave like Caitlyn Jenner, because she's such a great example for everyone else.
[03:46:29.415 --> 03:46:39.699]  You know, the people who like to hack off their penises because they feel they were born that way, and that's their right to do it, but don't make me pay for it with my tax money.
[03:46:39.699 --> 03:46:47.122]  But obviously, eventually, through Obamacare, you will be paying for this woman to be blind, willingly, through your tax money.
[03:46:47.822 --> 03:46:51.844]  And again, it's Body Integrity Identity Disorder.
[03:46:51.844 --> 03:47:05.852]  This is a mental illness that now the media, and if this doctor is to be believed, the medical profession, is increasingly starting to mainstream and make into some kind of social justice cause.
[03:47:05.852 --> 03:47:11.676]  That because she was born wanting to be blind, because she had this mental illness, that now we should go around
[03:47:12.276 --> 03:47:16.517]  Helping people to pour drain cleaner in their eyes.
[03:47:16.517 --> 03:47:19.898]  How insane has this progressive disease got?
[03:47:19.898 --> 03:47:23.419]  Let's go to a call because Dean's been waiting a while.
[03:47:23.419 --> 03:47:25.599]  Let's go to Dean in North Carolina.
[03:47:25.599 --> 03:47:26.339]  You're on the air, Dean.
[03:47:26.339 --> 03:47:26.739]  Go ahead.
[03:47:42.628 --> 03:47:44.930]  Watching y'all for about six months.
[03:47:44.930 --> 03:47:50.474]  I appreciate all your reporting and all you do for the American people.
[03:47:50.474 --> 03:47:58.261]  Yesterday I was watching a piece from Chris Ann Hall and she was talking about the UN.
[03:47:58.261 --> 03:48:05.326]  They met yesterday and they were talking to all the mayors around the country and around the world about
[03:48:07.335 --> 03:48:10.938]  Coming up with this thing called Strong Cities Network.
[03:48:10.938 --> 03:48:19.925]  And they said it was going to be to help the people, but it's actually going to be the UN militarizing the police.
[03:48:19.925 --> 03:48:30.693]  And they say that they're going to put this thing in effect at their next meeting in spring in Paris, France.
[03:48:30.693 --> 03:48:36.177]  And said the reason for doing this was they were going to stop the violent extremists.
[03:48:38.339 --> 03:48:41.021]  Well that sounds very interesting, I'll definitely look into that.
[03:48:41.021 --> 03:48:45.163]  We've had this call for the UN to come in, you know, under emergency situations.
[03:48:45.163 --> 03:48:49.986]  The US military actually now is more geared to occupying foreign cities.
[03:48:49.986 --> 03:49:00.973]  So I guess in a case of, you know, martial law, those resources might be drawn elsewhere to the point where you might have a UN peacekeeping force come in if, you know, there is a major national disaster.
[03:49:00.973 --> 03:49:04.435]  We've had, you know, Henry Kissinger talk about that at Bilderberg events.
[03:49:04.935 --> 03:49:06.536]  So I'll definitely look into that.
[03:49:06.536 --> 03:49:09.137]  Trash Hauler in Bima Region 9.
[03:49:09.137 --> 03:49:11.818]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[03:49:11.818 --> 03:49:14.018]  Hey Paul, great to talk to you.
[03:49:14.018 --> 03:49:15.599]  Can you hear me okay?
[03:49:15.599 --> 03:49:16.599]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:49:16.599 --> 03:49:20.021]  Coming through clear.
[03:49:20.021 --> 03:49:21.681]  Okay.
[03:49:21.681 --> 03:49:27.323]  That was a great piece that you've been talking about that you did on people wanting to be trans-abled.
[03:49:27.323 --> 03:49:28.944]  And I got something.
[03:49:28.944 --> 03:49:33.326]  I didn't really want to let this one out of the bag, but last time I called,
[03:49:35.090 --> 03:49:39.231]  Uh, somebody checked down my number and said they were going to call me back, and I kind of fell for that.
[03:49:39.231 --> 03:49:44.012]  But anyways, um, maybe I can give you the idea on the air.
[03:49:44.012 --> 03:49:45.212]  Here it is.
[03:49:45.212 --> 03:49:51.314]  You have kind of this crazy group of people that want to be trans-able.
[03:49:51.314 --> 03:49:55.395]  They want to, um, they want a poor Drano in their eyes.
[03:49:55.395 --> 03:49:57.675]  They want their limbs cut off.
[03:49:57.675 --> 03:49:59.676]  Uh, they want to be taken care of, etc.
[03:49:59.676 --> 03:50:00.776]  And then, guess what?
[03:50:01.604 --> 03:50:09.888]  We have this thing, the other thing that's big is we have this thing called the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:50:09.888 --> 03:50:10.528]  You get that?
[03:50:10.528 --> 03:50:12.369]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:50:12.369 --> 03:50:28.836]  So, the elite forces, somehow, this could be part of a big media meme, I think certain elite forces want us
[03:50:30.319 --> 03:50:47.634]  Yeah, I think we got a story up on that today.
[03:50:47.634 --> 03:50:51.317]  Actually, I think Kurt Nimmo wrote about it, and it's an issue that we'll continue to cover.
[03:50:51.317 --> 03:50:52.217]  But thanks for the call.
[03:50:52.217 --> 03:50:54.920]  We'll be back with more news and more of your calls after the break.

[03:54:05.180 --> 03:54:06.706]  Yeah.
[03:54:10.919 --> 03:54:20.722]  Final segment of the 4th Hour, I'm driving the Alex Jones Show live, I'm Paul John Swartz and we're going to go to David Knight in a moment with an update on what's coming up tonight on InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:54:20.722 --> 03:54:27.805]  But the College Fix is reporting, students warned, bulging biceps, big guns, advanced unhealthy masculinity.
[03:54:27.805 --> 03:54:28.645]  The size of G.I.
[03:54:28.645 --> 03:54:36.047]  Joe's biceps and Arnold Schwarzenegger's guns in the Terminator movies is proof that the dominant form of masculinity is out of control.
[03:54:36.047 --> 03:54:37.728]  This is Vanderbilt University.
[03:54:38.368 --> 03:54:44.250]  Teaching students that working out and having muscles is toxic.
[03:54:44.250 --> 03:54:46.870]  We also have this out of campus reform.
[03:54:46.870 --> 03:54:49.551]  UCSD says the term minorities is offensive.
[03:54:49.551 --> 03:54:51.991]  Tells students to say people of colour.
[03:54:51.991 --> 03:55:00.334]  So, you can't work out, you can't stay fit, you can't say minorities, you can't say mother and father, you can't say children.
[03:55:00.334 --> 03:55:01.814]  Basically, you can't do anything.
[03:55:01.974 --> 03:55:04.256]  You can't say America, that's offensive.
[03:55:04.256 --> 03:55:06.919]  But you can pour drain cleaner in your eyes.
[03:55:06.919 --> 03:55:08.260]  That's trendy.
[03:55:08.260 --> 03:55:12.144]  You can get up on Salon.com and say, I'm a paedophile.
[03:55:12.144 --> 03:55:14.246]  Give me support and understanding.
[03:55:14.246 --> 03:55:19.210]  And then when anyone criticizes a paedophile being given a platform, they're hateful.
[03:55:19.210 --> 03:55:19.771]  Okay?
[03:55:19.771 --> 03:55:20.932]  Paedophilia is trendy.
[03:55:21.252 --> 03:55:24.055]  Pouring drain cleaner in your eyes is trendy.
[03:55:24.055 --> 03:55:29.500]  Peeing yourself and posting photos of it on Twitter as feminists are now doing, that's trendy.
[03:55:29.500 --> 03:55:34.165]  But don't go and work out in the gym, that's toxic masculinity.
[03:55:34.165 --> 03:55:38.009]  This is the progressive hellhole that we now live in.
[03:55:38.009 --> 03:55:42.173]  David Knight, you've got some top stories coming up on InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:55:42.173 --> 03:55:42.914]  Break it down for us.
[03:55:43.564 --> 03:55:47.085]  Yes, Paul, we've got the Trans-Pacific Partnership has now been settled.
[03:55:47.085 --> 03:55:48.466]  That's going to head the United States.
[03:55:48.466 --> 03:55:55.369]  We've got the fight of our life in this, and we're going to take a look at what this might mean, because of course, Speaker Boehner is stepping down.
[03:55:55.369 --> 03:55:58.250]  Are they going to fast-track this through before he gets out?
[03:55:58.250 --> 03:56:04.092]  Another person has put his name into the hat to replace Boehner, and of course, that's Congressman Chaffey.
[03:56:04.092 --> 03:56:05.933]  And Chaffey is, sorry, from New Mexico.
[03:56:06.553 --> 03:56:15.057]  This is the same guy that the Secret Service was just trying to attack with information that they had on him when he was investigating their failures.
[03:56:15.057 --> 03:56:16.758]  So this is an interesting development with that.
[03:56:16.758 --> 03:56:20.080]  We're also going to be talking about what happened on Saturday.
[03:56:20.080 --> 03:56:25.903]  You know, Obama was using the shooting on Thursday to attack guns in the Second Amendment.
[03:56:26.503 --> 03:56:31.206]  And then on Saturday, there was a mass shooting, a killing, attacking a hospital.
[03:56:31.206 --> 03:56:32.526]  This is a war crime.
[03:56:32.526 --> 03:56:35.868]  This went on for 30 minutes after they were notified.
[03:56:35.868 --> 03:56:39.330]  This is a very deliberate effect, but there's more to it than that, Paul.
[03:56:39.330 --> 03:56:44.153]  This also is about the unraveling of Afghanistan, just like we've seen in Iraq.
[03:56:44.153 --> 03:56:46.834]  That's what's essentially behind this attack in Kunduz.
[03:56:46.834 --> 03:56:51.677]  It's a desperate attack by the military to try to get control of that area.
[03:56:51.677 --> 03:56:53.918]  They're losing control of Afghanistan as well.
[03:56:55.655 --> 03:56:59.629]  OK, David Hart, be sure to tune in to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:56:59.629 --> 03:57:02.037]  Again, I just mentioned it, let's just finish off with this.
[03:57:03.140 --> 03:57:04.301]  I don't know if I can say the word.
[03:57:04.301 --> 03:57:05.902]  I'll say P for Equality.
[03:57:05.902 --> 03:57:08.204]  Feminists call for 4chan troll campaign.
[03:57:08.204 --> 03:57:11.266]  Fall for 4chan troll campaign by peeing themselves.
[03:57:11.266 --> 03:57:22.074]  They actually fell for this 4chan troll campaign where they said, hey, let's make fun of feminists by saying P for Equality to support rape victims.
[03:57:22.074 --> 03:57:23.895]  And they actually got up and did it.
[03:57:23.895 --> 03:57:27.478]  A bunch of feminists got on Twitter and basically peed themselves.
[03:57:28.118 --> 03:57:30.320]  Again, this isn't the first time it's happened.
[03:57:30.320 --> 03:57:32.202]  The Free Bleeding Movement.
[03:57:32.202 --> 03:57:41.310]  This is where women run marathons while on their period without wearing any kind of protection to fight the evil patriarchy.
[03:57:41.310 --> 03:57:43.932]  And again, that was a 4chan campaign.
[03:57:43.932 --> 03:57:47.655]  It was started as a troll campaign to make fun of feminists.
[03:57:47.655 --> 03:57:51.599]  To say, let's get them to do this to make themselves look ridiculous.
[03:57:51.599 --> 03:57:52.560]  And they actually did it.
[03:57:53.440 --> 03:58:05.064]  No, they've repeated the trick where, and granted it's only a few, feminists are getting up on Twitter posting pictures of themselves peeing their pants to support rape victims.
[03:58:05.064 --> 03:58:21.809]  Again, underscoring, illustrating the fact that these social justice warriors are so gullible that they'll basically fall for absolutely everything so long as it's done in the name of feminism, in the name of supporting this rape culture myth which doesn't exist.
[03:58:22.429 --> 03:58:27.255]  That's gonna wrap it up for the Alex Jones Show 4th Hour Overdrive again.
[03:58:27.255 --> 03:58:28.697]  Get some more of your calls tomorrow.
[03:58:28.697 --> 03:58:30.519]  Sorry for the people we couldn't get to.
[03:58:30.519 --> 03:58:32.622]  InfoWars Nightly News coming up tonight.
[03:58:32.622 --> 03:58:33.663]  Stay tuned for that.
[03:58:33.663 --> 03:58:35.826]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
