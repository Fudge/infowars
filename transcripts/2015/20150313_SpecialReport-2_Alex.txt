[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:22.107]  Hillary Rodham Clinton, mystery woman, first First Lady to be under criminal investigation, inundated by scandals from Little Rock, Arkansas to Washington, D.C.
[00:00:22.547 --> 00:00:37.497]  The Clintons squeaked by Kenneth Starr's lengthy investigation into what is now known as the Whitewater scandal, a shady real estate deal the Clintons were never prosecuted for, although their associates were convicted of federal fraud and conspiracy charges.
[00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:46.563]  During the first year of Bill Clinton's tenure in the White House, they fired seven employees with the White House travel office in order to reward their friends with jobs.
[00:00:47.044 --> 00:01:02.675]  Travelgate erupted, and the Clinton's personal lawyer and Deputy White House Counsel, a man Hillary regularly abused, supposedly committed suicide over having to testify knowing full well all of Hillary's devious secret pathways to power.
[00:01:02.955 --> 00:01:16.140]  Hillary lied under oath to the Office of Independent Counsel, claiming the last time she spoke with Foster was before Father's Day, when in fact Vince Foster's assistant had seen her with Foster four times after that date.
[00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.943]  Patrick Knowlton, an eyewitness, saw men in red vests fleeing the area before Foster's body was discovered.
[00:01:24.263 --> 00:01:25.684]  Fast forward to today.
[00:01:25.864 --> 00:01:31.726]  Hillary's private emails were all transmitted on a private server registered to her home in Chippewa,
[00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:41.656]  New York, while she was acting as a Secretary of State, that oversaw the overthrow of Gaddafi, the Syrian civil war, the turmoil in Egypt, and the Benghazi scandal.
[00:01:42.037 --> 00:01:51.307]  Ironically, President Obama signed a law last November that requires government officials to direct their official correspondence through private email to a government account.
[00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:55.996]  Earlier today, Hillary gave a speech about women's rights at the United Nations.
[00:01:56.216 --> 00:02:03.179]  Hillary addressed her Globalist New World Order cohorts from a room in the United States where press freedom is heavily restricted.
[00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:17.385]  She then traipsed out to face the music yet again, addressing her burgeoning career as a professional scandal creator by not initially addressing the subject at hand, instead acting presidential by speaking on the Iranian nuclear issue
[00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:22.847]  Before launching into an orchestrated series of safe questions and even safer answers.
[00:02:23.347 --> 00:02:31.809]  So even if you have a work-related device with a work-related .gov account, you choose what goes on that.
[00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:33.170]  That is the way our system works.
[00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.792]  Earlier, her daughter Chelsea had announced that she might run for office, adding more loathing to the failed Clinton dynasty.
[00:02:39.932 --> 00:02:45.994]  We can expect Hillary the trainwreck to announce that she is running for the highest executive position in the United States.
[00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:53.856]  Why in the hell would America vote for this entitled, disingenuous, double-dealing person for president?
[00:02:54.116 --> 00:03:04.578]  I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[00:03:04.838 --> 00:03:10.900]  If she survives this latest debacle, maybe her campaign slogan should be, vote for Hillary.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.640]  You think those were scandals?
[00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:15.475]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:03:15.555 --> 00:03:17.076]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:19.617]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:03:33.582 --> 00:03:37.965]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:03:38.265 --> 00:03:40.527]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:03:40.847 --> 00:03:50.534]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:03:50.874 --> 00:03:59.077]  That's why we're rolling out on a 100% made in America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
[00:03:59.298 --> 00:04:01.819]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
[00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:06.481]  We are helping fellow Americans rediscover what made this country great.
[00:04:06.861 --> 00:04:07.761]  We are the spirit of 1776.
[00:04:09.262 --> 00:04:11.543]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[00:04:11.603 --> 00:04:16.825]  We are all brothers and sisters in arms in the animating contest of liberty.
[00:04:17.105 --> 00:04:17.886]  We're good to go.
