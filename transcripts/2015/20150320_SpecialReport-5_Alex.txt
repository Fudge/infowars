[00:00:02.359 --> 00:00:03.159]  It's stimulating.
[00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.160]  Mind expanding.
[00:00:06.021 --> 00:00:07.822]  Safer to use than alcohol.
[00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:09.782]  It's the in thing.
[00:00:10.763 --> 00:00:13.204]  Such are the myths concerning marijuana.
[00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:19.190]  Myths that lull thousands of young people into experimenting with obnoxious weed.
[00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.414]  Marijuana, the burning weed with its roots in hell.
[00:00:25.014 --> 00:00:26.516]  Should marijuana be legalized?
[00:00:26.876 --> 00:00:28.797]  We'll debate the pros and cons right now.
[00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:31.680]  Marijuana leads to doing worse things.
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.500]  That's just a fact.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.701]  I don't care what anybody says.
[00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:40.787]  The drug war is a total failure and the federal drug war ought to be revisited and for the most part gotten rid of.
[00:00:41.027 --> 00:00:49.310]  This has corrupted our government, it has destroyed our due process, and it is withholding from people medicine that is very effective, and we need to stop it.
[00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:51.891]  We need to roll Prohibition back right now.
[00:00:51.911 --> 00:00:58.974]  Marijuana is natural, you know, there's so many different things that you can use it for, including, you know, helping cancer patients.
[00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:03.036]  I'm a Christian minister, and I believe, you know, Jesus would be okay with it.
[00:01:03.416 --> 00:01:20.444]  There have been studies proven that children who have 400 seizures a day, that's intense, that's like a seizure a minute, who can't stop just violently convulsing, have been helped and have stopped having seizures 2-3 days after applying the cannabinoid oil treatment to themselves, like in their food or something like that.
[00:01:20.464 --> 00:01:21.225]  That's incredible!
[00:01:21.485 --> 00:01:23.686]  There's proof of that, it's all over the internet.
[00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:33.929]  The mandatory minimums, locking people up for non-violent crimes for very long periods of time, where there's no discretion for the fact that they were non-violent, that this is their first offense.
[00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.349]  No, just lock them up.
[00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.730]  You two-bit heroes, making life miserable for innocent children.
[00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:41.751]  Why don't you go out and hunt real criminals?
[00:01:42.091 --> 00:01:43.591]  We got a tip on this drag race.
[00:01:43.611 --> 00:01:45.352]  That one we found the marijuana.
[00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:47.488]  Well, sir, that's a very serious charge.
[00:01:47.528 --> 00:02:13.150]  Think about the tens of billions of dollars that Big Pharma makes a year, with close to 20% of the population being on antidepressants, when every major study shows that marijuana absolutely destroys depression in people, and Prozac can't even prove that it has any measurable positive effect, and they have to put on the insert that it may make you commit suicide!
[00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.777]  Things like alcohol kill people daily, and it's legal because it can be taxed.
[00:02:19.057 --> 00:02:21.060]  Happy to deliver alcohol.
[00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:23.203]  But weed is illegal, right?
[00:02:23.323 --> 00:02:25.325]  Hey bud, let's party!
[00:02:33.183 --> 00:02:35.804]  We think, however, that the pharmaceutical companies should stay away.
[00:02:35.824 --> 00:02:37.365]  Like, just keep it natural.
[00:02:37.405 --> 00:02:38.365]  Like, have the sun out.
[00:02:38.405 --> 00:02:40.006]  You know, like, grow some seeds in the dirt.
[00:02:40.486 --> 00:02:41.646]  You know, just stay away.
[00:02:41.746 --> 00:02:42.727]  You know, let it be.
[00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:44.067]  You know, like, let it grow organically.
[00:02:44.127 --> 00:02:45.928]  And, like, that's what will help people.
[00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:50.370]  It definitely should not be legal because that's helping us make money on the streets.
[00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.450]  End probation.
[00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.310]  Peace.
[00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.811]  What's the obstacle?
[00:02:53.831 --> 00:02:54.951]  What the hell is stopping it?
[00:02:54.971 --> 00:02:56.672]  Why is Texas taking so long?
[00:02:56.872 --> 00:02:59.393]  There's so many benefits for something that's natural.
[00:02:59.473 --> 00:03:03.395]  We need to look more into natural medicines and not things that are scientifically made in a lab.
[00:03:17.022 --> 00:03:18.343]  This is not reefer madness.
[00:03:18.363 --> 00:03:30.748]  This is one big industry that has political clout trying to shut down another industry that basically has a product that grows freely and is not owned by anybody.
[00:03:30.868 --> 00:03:33.429]  I don't want the government regulating my marijuana.
[00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.170]  Right now they're regulating you.
[00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.971]  They'll arrest you if you smoke it.
[00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:37.871]  That's regulation.
[00:03:38.212 --> 00:03:39.732]  But only if I get caught.
[00:03:39.972 --> 00:03:41.973]  Look at what the pharmaceutical companies are doing.
[00:03:42.173 --> 00:03:44.975]  They want to take away our informed consent
[00:03:46.195 --> 00:03:53.042]  And violate the Nuremberg Code, saying that they can inject us with whatever they deem to be necessary at any given time.
[00:03:53.082 --> 00:03:55.604]  We should be very, very concerned about this.
[00:03:55.664 --> 00:04:03.992]  I didn't know you were a weedhead, Tony.
[00:04:05.393 --> 00:04:06.134]  All my friends are.
[00:04:14.451 --> 00:04:22.313]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:04:22.573 --> 00:04:24.653]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:04:24.793 --> 00:04:27.454]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:04:27.494 --> 00:04:31.595]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:04:31.915 --> 00:04:35.075]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:04:35.095 --> 00:04:42.357]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:04:42.517 --> 00:04:53.601]  The brainwashing media machine has been turned up on high and it's time for humanity to double down on the true people's media and strike back against the tyrants that are destroying our civilization with their lies and fraud.
[00:04:53.781 --> 00:04:55.162]  We are the resistance.
[00:04:55.442 --> 00:04:56.802]  You are the resistance.
[00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:58.743]  You are the info war.
[00:04:58.903 --> 00:05:03.025]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:05:03.205 --> 00:05:04.866]  We are the true media.
[00:05:05.026 --> 00:05:07.607]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:11.268]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
