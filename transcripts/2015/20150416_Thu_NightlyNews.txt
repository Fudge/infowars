[00:00:19.534 --> 00:00:21.496]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.616 --> 00:00:22.276]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:22.436 --> 00:00:23.397]  It's Thursday, April 16, 2015.
[00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:26.380]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:30.203 --> 00:00:37.269]  Tonight, Obama garners praise for his role in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:42.653]  And the BLM is up to their old tricks, this time in Oregon.
[00:00:43.374 --> 00:00:47.137]  That's next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:58.665]  That manly culture, John Wayne and 707 horsepower cars, is coming back and it threatens the New World Order and it's culture that we've got, 1776!
[00:00:59.406 --> 00:01:04.129]  Well the Trans-Pacific Partnership is coming before the Senate in just a matter of days.
[00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:16.696]  Things are building to a head and of course we've been talking about the Trans-Pacific Partnership as well as the Trans-Atlantic Partnership for a long time here at InfoWars, talking about how this is the next step in global governance.
[00:01:17.296 --> 00:01:24.499]  As Time Magazine points out, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, they say, will help to define Obama's legacy as a president.
[00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:32.042]  It is also going to define who these senators are that want to be president, especially the ones in the Republican Party.
[00:01:32.362 --> 00:01:41.206]  Senators like Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and others will have to watch them very closely to see what they do with this fast-tracked
[00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:42.166]  We're good.
[00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:57.082]  There's something else there when it's that large.
[00:01:57.102 --> 00:02:04.084]  And of course, this is an agreement that has been negotiated in secret by corporate lobbyists for many, many years.
[00:02:04.144 --> 00:02:09.405]  And our elected representatives have not been allowed to see it, or if they see it, they're not allowed to talk about it.
[00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:10.645]  And it's going to come before the Senate.
[00:02:10.885 --> 00:02:14.406]  They're going to have to, as part of the fast-track process, vote on it very quickly.
[00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.867]  They will not be allowed to offer any amendments.
[00:02:16.927 --> 00:02:19.808]  It'll be an up or down, take it or leave it, all at once.
[00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:21.869]  This, again, is going to be coming up in the next few days.
[00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:23.169]  Let's take a look, though.
[00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:24.970]  At NAFTA's legacy.
[00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.352]  Because when Obama presented this to people, he said, of course mistakes were made with NAFTA.
[00:02:30.372 --> 00:02:31.253]  We're not going to do that again.
[00:02:31.293 --> 00:02:37.436]  And yet he has many people in his close cabinet of economic advisors who wrote NAFTA.
[00:02:37.476 --> 00:02:39.117]  Let's look at what NAFTA has done for us.
[00:02:39.137 --> 00:02:41.278]  And of course, this is a bipartisan effort.
[00:02:41.538 --> 00:02:45.660]  It was Bill Clinton that claimed that NAFTA would create an export boom to Mexico.
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.942]  He said it would create 200,000 jobs in just two years.
[00:02:49.222 --> 00:02:51.463]  And remember, both Clinton and Bush
[00:02:52.083 --> 00:02:52.583]  Number one.
[00:02:52.643 --> 00:02:53.243]  Bush number one.
[00:02:53.283 --> 00:02:55.264]  We're both in favor of NAFTA at the time.
[00:02:55.644 --> 00:02:56.865]  But what have we really seen?
[00:02:57.545 --> 00:03:04.407]  Not 200,000 new jobs in two years, but we have seen 682,000 jobs gone.
[00:03:04.427 --> 00:03:06.908]  61% of those in manufacturing.
[00:03:06.948 --> 00:03:13.270]  And of course, other organizations like the Chamber of Commerce that want to promote this are telling us, well look, we've had jobs created.
[00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.290]  They're not looking at the net number of jobs.
[00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.011]  They're just looking at jobs that were created by
[00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:21.235]  Exports, not jobs that have been lost due to imports.
[00:03:21.595 --> 00:03:23.918]  Let's take a look at the deficit side of this.
[00:03:23.978 --> 00:03:25.539]  That's the other part of the economic news.
[00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.281]  Look at this chart from the same article.
[00:03:28.222 --> 00:03:33.828]  You can see that immediately after passage, we have the largest trade deficit the U.S.
[00:03:33.868 --> 00:03:34.529]  had ever seen.
[00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:35.330]  Right after it.
[00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.931]  And it never got smaller.
[00:03:37.512 --> 00:03:41.796]  That trade deficit, that massive trade deficit, continued for a number of years, and then it grew.
[00:03:41.836 --> 00:03:47.182]  And for the last 14 years, we have had 14 record trade deficits.
[00:03:47.722 --> 00:03:54.649]  So it's not just a loss of income, which comes with a loss of jobs, but as we go into debt, there is a loss of wealth.
[00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:06.314]  And we can see that in terms of multinational corporations and foreign governments coming in and basically asking for our resources from our senators who then turn it over to them.
[00:04:06.814 --> 00:04:11.536]  That's what we saw happening with the BLM trying to do that in Nevada.
[00:04:11.576 --> 00:04:12.596]  We see that going on.
[00:04:13.116 --> 00:04:15.457]  John McCain has been successful in doing that in Arizona.
[00:04:15.677 --> 00:04:22.239]  We're going to be talking to someone at the end of the program where we see the endgame being played with the minors in Oregon.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.180]  But it's not just America.
[00:04:25.165 --> 00:04:26.667]  And of course it's not really a failure.
[00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:28.669]  And it's not just about economics either.
[00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:33.735]  It would be a mistake to see this simply as an economic failure, as bad economic policy.
[00:04:34.195 --> 00:04:37.018]  No, it's doing precisely what it was designed to do.
[00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:41.783]  And the other part of this that mainstream media is not talking about is the loss of sovereignty.
[00:04:42.284 --> 00:04:42.825]  We're good to go.
[00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:02.559]  Now they are consolidating those regions into a global governance.
[00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:04.380]  That's what the Trilateral Commission was all about.
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.821]  And again, that was Carter's Chief of Staff, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who created the Trilateral Commission.
[00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:13.622]  It was going to be North America, Europe, Asia.
[00:05:13.742 --> 00:05:16.843]  And that's where we see these trade agreements and now the consolidation.
[00:05:16.903 --> 00:05:24.685]  And so they're coming out of the closet telling us, oh yeah, NAFTA was about sovereignty all along, but don't worry, this is about simply trade.
[00:05:25.285 --> 00:05:26.486]  It's not simply about trade.
[00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:27.607]  We can see that's happening.
[00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:29.888]  We need to stand up en masse and take it down.
[00:05:29.908 --> 00:05:32.390]  And as I point out, it's not just here in America.
[00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.211]  The same thing is happening in Europe.
[00:05:34.912 --> 00:05:41.076]  People who are trying to renegotiate the treaty, the European Union treaty, especially those in the UK.
[00:05:42.037 --> 00:05:53.159]  Are now seeing that even at this stage, the EU is saying they're not going to listen to the treaty, they're not going to abide by the process, the rules that have been set in place.
[00:05:53.519 --> 00:06:00.601]  We see the story from RT saying that Juncker doesn't have authority to delay the EU treaty changes, say Tories.
[00:06:00.641 --> 00:06:04.122]  Now this is the guy who is the President of the European Union Commission.
[00:06:04.502 --> 00:06:09.203]  They say a growing number of bureaucrats oppose Prime Minister David Cameron of the UK,
[00:06:10.003 --> 00:06:13.225]  They oppose his demand for EU treaty renegotiation.
[00:06:13.245 --> 00:06:21.649]  They're fearful of a quiet democratic revolution that is coming out of the EU citizens' will to protect the sovereignty of their national parliaments.
[00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:28.893]  And so what they're going to do is they're going to delay this until they have time to consolidate this more.
[00:06:28.913 --> 00:06:38.678]  And as I pointed out, one of the Conservative Party members said, treaty change is entirely a matter for the member states using the Commission as secretariat.
[00:06:39.178 --> 00:06:42.560]  They're saying he's asserting powers that he doesn't have.
[00:06:43.181 --> 00:06:44.242]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:06:44.822 --> 00:06:46.283]  We see that all the time, don't we?
[00:06:46.323 --> 00:06:57.050]  And yet, it was just a couple of weeks ago that we saw people like the head of PIMCO, the world's largest bond company, saying we were going to have to have a United States of Europe for this to work.
[00:06:57.691 --> 00:07:04.596]  That these defaults that were coming from Greece and others were going to break apart the European Union unless they asserted sovereignty.
[00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:08.581]  So you can see there again, it's not simply a trade agreement.
[00:07:08.641 --> 00:07:10.042]  It is not a free trade zone.
[00:07:10.423 --> 00:07:14.045]  This was always about creating a United States of Europe.
[00:07:14.585 --> 00:07:18.668]  Now the head of the bond company, the world's largest bond company, PIMCO, is saying it.
[00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:22.251]  We've also had Alan Greenspan saying exactly the same thing.
[00:07:22.271 --> 00:07:24.292]  So they're telling us where this is headed.
[00:07:24.332 --> 00:07:30.757]  This is clearly a case of international sovereignty being lost to these corporations.
[00:07:31.508 --> 00:07:38.310]  We all need to stand up, pay very close attention to this, and pay attention to what the Senators do, how they vote on this.
[00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.531]  That will tell you who really owns them, or if they're their own man.
[00:07:43.291 --> 00:07:54.434]  Now in other news, we see that we're also learning that from the mainstream media, finally admitting what we've been telling you for five years, that the TSA has been condoning systemically
[00:07:55.234 --> 00:08:01.197]  Sexual molestation, sexual crimes against adults and against children.
[00:08:01.257 --> 00:08:02.437]  Now they're coming out and saying it.
[00:08:02.838 --> 00:08:09.421]  We have this story from Time Magazine saying former TSA agent says the groping scandal is business as usual.
[00:08:09.481 --> 00:08:20.106]  And of course there's a recent story that we've covered here at Info Wars about two TSA screeners at the Denver International Airport manipulating the full-body scanners so they could grope men's crotches.
[00:08:20.606 --> 00:08:30.508]  They say, however, over the course of six years of the TSA, the leveraging of rules and surveillance tools to abuse passengers was a daily checkpoint occurrence.
[00:08:31.516 --> 00:08:37.140]  And the writer of this article is disturbed because there's so many jokes in the comments section.
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.481]  He says this is not a joke.
[00:08:38.902 --> 00:08:48.629]  He says it's easy to forget that the groping or so of these dozen or so male passengers by two conspiring TSA screeners is sexual assault, plain and simple.
[00:08:49.449 --> 00:08:54.713]  And they also point out that this is something that was an investigation that was shut down by the TSA.
[00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:57.956]  There are no criminal charges being brought against these screeners.
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.841]  They're not going to jail.
[00:08:59.901 --> 00:09:01.182]  They simply lost their jobs.
[00:09:01.262 --> 00:09:04.204]  And the TSA is still protecting their identity.
[00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:10.409]  As TechDirt reports, the TSA's investigation into groping agents ensured that they would not be prosecuted.
[00:09:10.429 --> 00:09:14.753]  They say many people find it odd that two TSA agents, who are still unnamed,
[00:09:15.353 --> 00:09:19.517]  ...merely lost their jobs rather than getting arrested for the activity.
[00:09:20.237 --> 00:09:35.431]  And an investigator, Chris Bray at TSA News, found out as she looked at Denver police reports that the TSA set up its investigation in a manner that would guarantee that no criminal charges or the names of the TSA agents would ever be revealed.
[00:09:35.691 --> 00:09:39.774]  She said the TSA was first told about this scheme back in November 18th of 2014 and for nearly two months.
[00:09:42.717 --> 00:09:45.799]  They allowed these sexual perverts to continue operating.
[00:09:46.219 --> 00:09:47.460]  To continue what they were doing.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.001]  Did not notify the police.
[00:09:49.081 --> 00:09:52.444]  If they had told the police, the police could have observed what was going on.
[00:09:52.484 --> 00:09:53.985]  They could have arrested these individuals.
[00:09:54.085 --> 00:10:03.811]  Instead, what they did was they didn't tell the Denver police until after these individuals had been fired and were long gone and said, well, we're not going to tell you who they are.
[00:10:04.031 --> 00:10:12.217]  That's kind of like, as I point out in the article, kind of like reporting a fire long after the building has burned down and there's nothing but a bunch of cold ashes there.
[00:10:12.797 --> 00:10:23.822]  And I just want to point out to you that we have been mocked and criticized by the mainstream media for over five years for pointing out that this is systemic perversion in the TSA.
[00:10:23.882 --> 00:10:27.083]  Take a look at this report from April 26, for example, 2012.
[00:10:27.143 --> 00:10:31.645]  The TSA is still groping children at airports, reported.
[00:10:32.105 --> 00:10:35.587]  And they said the agents are coldly referring to kids as suspects.
[00:10:36.604 --> 00:10:47.451]  Steve Watson pointed out in this article, a four-year-old girl was called a suspect in order to undergo a full pat-down by TSA officers after hugging her grandmother during the screening process.
[00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:58.517]  And then, of course, Paul Joseph Watson pointed out, also in 2012, FOIA letters, Freedom of Information Act request letters, reveal shocking cases of TSA groping genitals.
[00:10:58.537 --> 00:11:00.098]  See, we said they're groping genitals.
[00:11:00.158 --> 00:11:01.679]  Everybody says, oh, you're exaggerating.
[00:11:01.959 --> 00:11:02.980]  You're overstating the case.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:03.620]  It's hyperbole.
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.541]  It's not that bad.
[00:11:04.781 --> 00:11:05.862]  We have a legal system.
[00:11:06.522 --> 00:11:09.625]  We don't have a legal system that protects us anymore.
[00:11:10.206 --> 00:11:18.014]  We have a criminal agency that is covering up and creating this kind of atmosphere where the public gets sexually molested.
[00:11:18.294 --> 00:11:20.537]  It's a power play, as Alex has pointed out many times.
[00:11:20.817 --> 00:11:21.678]  Listen to this article from 2012.
[00:11:22.819 --> 00:11:27.364]  Hundreds of letters of complaint about the TSA's invasive security procedures released this week.
[00:11:27.564 --> 00:11:28.886]  That was three years ago.
[00:11:29.626 --> 00:11:35.828]  Under the FOIA request, include numerous horror stories about TSA screeners directly touching people's genitals during pat-downs.
[00:11:36.088 --> 00:11:49.812]  The letters confirmed what we first reported back in 2010, five years ago now, that the TSA's new security procedures for advanced pat-downs include literally touching and in some cases groping the genitals of travelers.
[00:11:50.392 --> 00:11:53.973]  And as a final comment, I would say take a look at this article from 2014, last year.
[00:11:55.874 --> 00:12:10.223]  We pointed out that there was a case of a pervert in an airport who was going around, he dressed up as a TSA screener, and he was going around and feeling people, yet the victims didn't realize that this guy was an imposter, even though he was drunk.
[00:12:11.325 --> 00:12:19.093]  Do we realize that the real imposter that we see before us is the TSA, is Homeland Security?
[00:12:19.734 --> 00:12:27.342]  They are drunk with power and they are molesting the American public and the American public can't even see it.
[00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:28.830]  Stay with us.
[00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:35.276]  Right after the break, we're going to talk about the real roots of our problems and surveillance.
[00:12:35.337 --> 00:12:37.378]  And it's not just the war of terror.
[00:12:37.398 --> 00:12:39.340]  It goes back to the war on drugs.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.341]  That's where it all began.
[00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:45.086]  And we're going to see some amazing statements by some Republican wannabe presidents.
[00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:45.706]  Stay with us.
[00:12:45.726 --> 00:12:46.307]  We'll be right back.
[00:12:48.635 --> 00:12:50.196]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:12:50.616 --> 00:12:56.681]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:12:56.901 --> 00:13:11.411]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running 6 miles every other day, swimming 2-3 miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights
[00:13:11.971 --> 00:13:12.371]  We're good.
[00:13:35.032 --> 00:13:37.693]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated.
[00:13:37.933 --> 00:13:39.533]  My muscle mass increased.
[00:13:39.693 --> 00:13:42.354]  My stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:13:42.654 --> 00:13:44.174]  Now is the time to take action.
[00:13:44.434 --> 00:13:47.275]  Start your journey today with the Alex Challenge Pack.
[00:13:47.475 --> 00:13:49.116]  It's the trifecta of change.

[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.262]  The vaccination lies and hysteria continue to ramp up in California.
[00:15:01.562 --> 00:15:05.184]  The Temecula Valley School District recently sent a letter home to parents stating the following.
[00:15:05.524 --> 00:15:11.208]  To help protect your children and others from whooping cough, a new California law now requires students to be vaccinated against whooping cough.
[00:15:11.449 --> 00:15:16.052]  This applies to all students entering the 7th grade and any student transferring from out of state.
[00:15:16.793 --> 00:15:21.376]  But they fail to mention the exemption that exists by law that covers medical or personal beliefs.
[00:15:21.736 --> 00:15:33.726]  In fact, you can find it in the California Health and Safety Code 120325, and the particulars of the exemption can be found in California Health and Safety Code 120360, which is specifically about the exemptions.
[00:15:34.326 --> 00:15:42.970]  It's letters like these that continue to push Big Pharma's agenda to inject you and your young children with toxins, heavy metals, live viruses, and DNA from insects.
[00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.111]  Don't be intimidated by vaccine pushers.
[00:15:45.391 --> 00:15:47.992]  Do your own research and read the damn insert!
[00:15:48.433 --> 00:15:51.494]  This is Rob Due reporting for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:15:51.954 --> 00:15:55.636]  For more reports like these, subscribe to the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:16:11.664 --> 00:16:12.244]  Welcome back.
[00:16:12.545 --> 00:16:16.548]  Now, it's not just the TSA that is coming up for consideration in just a few days.
[00:16:16.568 --> 00:16:25.395]  The Guardian reports that Section 215 of the Patriot Act is coming up for reconsideration in 45 days.
[00:16:25.896 --> 00:16:34.483]  Now, of course, 215 was the part of the Patriot Act that the NSA said, that gives us the right to collect bulk data on people.
[00:16:34.783 --> 00:16:36.665]  But if you remember, Michael Hayden
[00:16:37.165 --> 00:16:37.665]  We're good.
[00:16:49.946 --> 00:16:50.186]  Right.
[00:16:50.766 --> 00:16:52.787]  This is something that has been going on a long time.
[00:16:52.827 --> 00:16:57.589]  It's one of the reasons why I support taking down drug prohibition.
[00:16:57.609 --> 00:17:03.572]  The war on drugs is where this is all originated, and people haven't seen this for a long time.
[00:17:03.872 --> 00:17:15.277]  Thankfully now, some people are starting to see this, as Michael Hayden made his case that he had this order, this super secret order that nobody but he and the President knew about, that allowed him to do whatever he wished.
[00:17:16.658 --> 00:17:23.363]  Who respected the Constitution, who respected the rule of law, like William Binney and Thomas Drake resigned as whistleblowers in protest.
[00:17:23.383 --> 00:17:26.526]  But this has been going on a long time in the War on Drugs.
[00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.287]  Look at this article from the Washington Post.
[00:17:28.587 --> 00:17:33.771]  They point out the shared roots of the War on Drugs and the War on Terror in one single chart.
[00:17:33.831 --> 00:17:34.512]  Look at that chart.
[00:17:34.992 --> 00:17:41.697]  Scroll down and show them that chart and you'll see that 90% of the wiretaps that are issued are for drug offenses.
[00:17:42.518 --> 00:17:51.766]  Now, of course, what that chart doesn't show you is that the NSA and the CIA don't go to court to get authorization for wiretaps or for surveillance.
[00:17:52.387 --> 00:18:01.715]  Actually, they do go to something that they call a court, the FISA court, and they get one order that they say allows them to do dragnet surveillance for all Americans.
[00:18:01.735 --> 00:18:03.237]  So I guess that just counts as one.
[00:18:03.797 --> 00:18:22.146]  But understand, as Andy Greenberg pointed out in this Washington Post article, he said the program serves as a reminder that most of the legal battles between government and surveillance efforts and the Fourth Amendment's privacy protections over the last decades have played out first on the front lines of America's war on drugs.
[00:18:22.326 --> 00:18:22.987]  Let's understand.
[00:18:23.467 --> 00:18:26.850]  This is not a war on drugs, and it's not a war on terrorism.
[00:18:27.251 --> 00:18:30.053]  It is a war of drugs against the American people.
[00:18:30.333 --> 00:18:33.036]  It is a war of terrorism against the American people.
[00:18:33.576 --> 00:18:36.179]  Our government is operating both sides of this.
[00:18:36.219 --> 00:18:46.989]  We have shown this over and over again, how our government supplies the drugs, runs the drugs, puts them into the communities as a plague, and then comes in and says, we're going to protect you from this holocaust that we've created.
[00:18:47.955 --> 00:18:53.677]  It's a government-run war of drug terrorism that they're running against us.
[00:18:53.737 --> 00:18:55.698]  But of course, Republicans want more of it.
[00:18:56.058 --> 00:18:59.440]  They want it harder and stronger than we're even getting it now.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.862]  We have two Republicans coming out and saying they vow a war on pot.
[00:19:04.582 --> 00:19:05.523]  If they take the White House.
[00:19:05.543 --> 00:19:07.244]  This is Marco Rubio and Chris Christie.
[00:19:07.504 --> 00:19:10.946]  They say they will clamp down on cannabis sales according to the Daily Mail.
[00:19:11.206 --> 00:19:13.827]  Rubio says, I think we need to enforce our federal laws.
[00:19:13.847 --> 00:19:15.008]  Well, I would agree with him.
[00:19:15.388 --> 00:19:17.850]  Why don't we enforce the Constitution for starters?
[00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:24.352]  Why don't you get an amendment to the Constitution like you had to do for alcohol to prohibit pot?
[00:19:24.853 --> 00:19:27.954]  It's because you don't respect the laws of our country, Marco Rubio.
[00:19:28.295 --> 00:19:35.239]  He also defended his framing of Hillary Clinton, they say, as past her prime and said he was knocking her ideas.
[00:19:36.038 --> 00:19:36.719]  And not her age.
[00:19:37.339 --> 00:19:43.124]  Well, let me point out that Marco Rubio's idea of drug prohibition is something that is now 44 years old.
[00:19:43.985 --> 00:19:46.467]  It's an abject failure for its stated purpose.
[00:19:47.448 --> 00:19:50.891]  But of course, it's also an agenda that was created by the UN 54 years ago.
[00:19:53.453 --> 00:19:56.576]  And it's stated purpose is not what it's real purpose is.
[00:19:56.656 --> 00:20:03.602]  It's real purpose is to give government and power to the government and to take power and rights away from the people.
[00:20:04.262 --> 00:20:09.647]  And then Chris Christie echoes back to Reefer Madness and he says, marijuana is a gateway drug.
[00:20:09.707 --> 00:20:11.809]  Listen, the war on drugs
[00:20:12.429 --> 00:20:19.791]  is a gateway to the loss of our rights, to the loss of due process, to the corruption of our court systems and law enforcement.
[00:20:19.911 --> 00:20:21.471]  That's the true gateway.
[00:20:21.931 --> 00:20:29.413]  That represents a far greater danger to us than individuals, and you can't solve the drug problem for individuals with law enforcement.
[00:20:29.733 --> 00:20:31.534]  But Rubio and Christie think they can.
[00:20:31.954 --> 00:20:33.294]  Listen to what else Rubio said.
[00:20:33.314 --> 00:20:41.236]  He said he believes in states' rights, but laws created by the federal government legally supersede those of the states.
[00:20:42.236 --> 00:20:44.217]  No, actually there's a division of power.
[00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:48.359]  These people are not qualified to be president.
[00:20:48.379 --> 00:20:52.201]  You need to understand that, along with most of the people that are running on both sides of this issue.
[00:20:52.561 --> 00:20:56.522]  Let's understand really where the war of terrorism is coming from.
[00:20:56.603 --> 00:21:00.564]  As I said before, it is a war of drugs of our government against the people.
[00:21:00.624 --> 00:21:05.907]  It is also a war of terrorism by our government against the people, terrorizing us.
[00:21:06.627 --> 00:21:09.808]  This is put out in some interesting format today.
[00:21:09.888 --> 00:21:18.071]  We have an article that shows a graph from a site that actually lists the number of people killed by cops over the last 15 years.
[00:21:18.571 --> 00:21:23.473]  An article on InfoWars.com Research shows cops kill thousands more Americans than terrorists.
[00:21:24.488 --> 00:21:31.710]  Americans are constantly warned every day there is a deadly threat from terrorists, but there's far more immediate and deadly threat to Americans across the nation.
[00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.890]  One that can strike at any time.
[00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:43.072]  One that has killed untold thousands more than lost their lives on September 11, 2001, and every other terrorist incident combined since then.
[00:21:43.132 --> 00:21:44.533]  The threat is the police.
[00:21:44.613 --> 00:21:49.574]  Now, if you look at this map, scroll down, look at this map, if you go to the article, you can actually zoom in on that map.
[00:21:50.523 --> 00:21:53.744]  You can hover over each of these individual incidents here.
[00:21:53.784 --> 00:21:58.246]  You can see how many people were killed and how they were killed in different areas.
[00:21:58.286 --> 00:22:06.208]  But as they point out, this organization that put together this data says that it only captured about 35% of total police killings since 2000 so far.
[00:22:08.189 --> 00:22:14.111]  So, at best, this map represents a minimum of police-related killings over the past 15 years.
[00:22:14.571 --> 00:22:16.231]  It's very difficult to get this information.
[00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:18.872]  They don't report on this information about themselves.
[00:22:18.952 --> 00:22:25.254]  And if you look at that map, as you hover over individual dots, you will see whether or not anybody was convicted of that.
[00:22:25.874 --> 00:22:33.876]  As he points out in this article, Steve Watson says, by those calculations, around 16,000 Americans are likely to have been killed by police in that time.
[00:22:34.496 --> 00:22:35.076]  Over 1,000 every year.
[00:22:37.057 --> 00:22:47.219]  And remember, as we pointed out, just over the first three months of this year, we've already had over 300 people killed nationally by the police, as reported by the media.
[00:22:47.239 --> 00:22:48.419]  Some people have totaled that up.
[00:22:48.679 --> 00:22:51.220]  It is actually increasing, not decreasing.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.420]  We need to have a discussion as to what the purpose of law enforcement is.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.941]  Is law enforcement a standing army?
[00:22:58.341 --> 00:23:04.702]  How can we have law and order in this country if our police are lawless and brutalizing the citizens?
[00:23:05.751 --> 00:23:17.180]  Stay with us, we're going to take a break, and right after the break we're going to talk to someone from the Gleas Mining District, the area where the BLM is threatening to take over a gold mine by force and not giving any explanation.
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.541]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:23:26.212 --> 00:23:27.433]  Another major health threat.
[00:23:27.473 --> 00:23:32.375]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:23:32.455 --> 00:23:35.076]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:23:35.116 --> 00:23:41.898]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:23:42.179 --> 00:23:45.040]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.101]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:23:48.181 --> 00:23:50.102]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:23:50.142 --> 00:23:52.963]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:23:53.063 --> 00:23:58.568]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:23:58.789 --> 00:24:02.272]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:24:02.292 --> 00:24:05.315]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:24:05.395 --> 00:24:12.502]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:24:12.722 --> 00:24:15.745]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[00:25:17.814 --> 00:25:19.596]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[00:25:19.936 --> 00:25:22.578]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[00:25:25.521 --> 00:25:30.005]  Are you concerned about police departments across America using stingray devices to steal cell phone data?
[00:25:30.165 --> 00:25:42.014]  The Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette reports Matthew Campbell, a lawyer representing three Fort Smith police officers in a whistleblower case, said that someone tried to hack into his computer by giving him an external hard drive contaminated with malicious hardware.
[00:25:42.295 --> 00:25:47.579]  It was Douglas Carson, the attorney representing Fort Smith and its police department, who sent Matthew Campbell the hard drive.
[00:25:47.859 --> 00:25:52.163]  Upon examination, it was discovered that the hard drive contained four Trojans, one of which was a duplicate.
[00:25:52.384 --> 00:25:56.027]  Mr. Campbell told PC Magazine, Seems like the Fort Smith government is taking a page from the NSA.
[00:25:56.067 --> 00:25:56.588]  In 2013, Spiegel reported,
[00:26:12.003 --> 00:26:19.746]  It maintains its own covert network, infiltrates computers around the world, and even intercepts shipping deliveries to plant back doors and electronics ordered by those it's targeting.
[00:26:20.027 --> 00:26:21.507]  Of course, it's all for our safety.
[00:26:21.807 --> 00:26:24.729]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:26:34.588 --> 00:26:40.030]  Earlier this week we reported on a situation that looks like it may be coming to a head in just over a week.
[00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:47.152]  Some miners in southern Oregon have been given a deadline to clear out of a mine that they've had since the 1870s.
[00:26:47.673 --> 00:26:54.195]  There's a clear chain of title and the miners are asking for a legal explanation from the BLM and they're not getting it.
[00:26:54.955 --> 00:27:03.923]  Both keepers have taken up a defensive posture there, one of providing security to try to make sure that nothing is going to happen until they can hear this through the court system.
[00:27:04.223 --> 00:27:07.366]  We're going to talk to Kirby Jackson from the Gleas Mining District.
[00:27:07.666 --> 00:27:10.189]  He's going to define for us what the mining district is.
[00:27:10.249 --> 00:27:12.311]  You'll be surprised, it's not just an association.
[00:27:12.591 --> 00:27:16.875]  He's also going to give us a history of what's been going on in the area, and you're going to see yet again
[00:27:17.395 --> 00:27:26.978]  How in 21st century America, bureaucracies are taking it upon themselves to not only write the laws, but enforce the laws and have their own court systems.
[00:27:27.438 --> 00:27:30.559]  We no longer have a government of, by, and for the people.
[00:27:30.599 --> 00:27:37.622]  We have a government of bureaucrats who are running this by themselves, for themselves, to create their empire.
[00:27:37.642 --> 00:27:40.883]  So joining us now is Kirby Jackson from the Gleas Mining District.
[00:27:41.732 --> 00:27:43.333]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Jackson.
[00:27:43.353 --> 00:27:51.537]  I guess one of the things we need to do first is kind of lay this out for the audience, because most people are not really familiar with what's going on in mining.
[00:27:51.797 --> 00:27:53.938]  Let's start with the Glease Mining District.
[00:27:53.978 --> 00:27:54.918]  This is not a club.
[00:27:55.298 --> 00:27:57.079]  It's not an association of miners.
[00:27:57.419 --> 00:27:58.380]  Tell us what this is.
[00:28:00.447 --> 00:28:04.008]  I am the recorder of what is referred to as the Gleef Mining District.
[00:28:05.028 --> 00:28:20.313]  Way back in 1872, when Congress first established the mining law, basically what they did at the time, all the miners on the ground, they were outlaws, they were regarded as squatters, and they had actually organized the first governments in a lot of these mining areas here.
[00:28:20.373 --> 00:28:22.373]  You know, we had mining camps and things like that.
[00:28:22.853 --> 00:28:28.695]  So the mining districts originally, they were the first governments in a lot of these areas before the counties and the states came about.
[00:28:29.395 --> 00:28:44.964]  So, in 1866, when Congress drafted their first mining law, it was actually really just a federal recognition of what the miners were already doing on the ground because, you know, our forerunners, they were the first government guys out here when we had an early frontier society.
[00:28:45.464 --> 00:28:55.630]  So, Congress, when they recognized what the miners were doing, that's what they decided was the best thing to do, they recognized these mining districts and they
[00:28:56.590 --> 00:29:14.996]  More or less, it was the first time in history that any government in the world had actually recognized that the miners who were working the land should also have the right to establish the rules and regulations as far as how they obtained their property, how they maintained their property, and basically how they settled grievances among themselves.
[00:29:15.416 --> 00:29:25.499]  Okay, so you've got a lot of different small mines that are there, and this is essentially, as you point out on your website, it's an organization of self-government.
[00:29:26.052 --> 00:29:38.002]  But it's a little bit different for people because a lot of, you know, what we're looking at in the cities and the counties, a lot of people don't really understand, just like they didn't understand at the Bundy Ranch, that there are different kinds of property rights.
[00:29:38.442 --> 00:29:40.784]  You're not saying that you own everything there.
[00:29:40.824 --> 00:29:45.007]  You've got mining rights, just like he had grazing rights or water rights.
[00:29:45.068 --> 00:29:48.470]  We have hunters who have rights to hunt as they're on the land.
[00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:54.135]  So there's all these different multiple uses that can exist on public lands at the same time, right?
[00:29:55.602 --> 00:29:56.102]  That's right.
[00:29:56.522 --> 00:30:09.354]  And basically what the mining law did, when it was first established, the main core of it was finally refined in 1872 in what is typically called the General Mining Act of 1872, and that's not its proper name.
[00:30:09.414 --> 00:30:11.656]  It had a very long name Congress had.
[00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.171]  We're good to go.
[00:30:27.882 --> 00:30:35.108]  Harvesting trees, or they were getting rocks, they basically recognized that these early settlers, they should have protection under the law.
[00:30:35.749 --> 00:30:55.266]  And so basically they wanted to define those rights so that the early rights of the miners were they not only had the right to go out on the lands out here which were held in trust by the government for the people, and that's still the way it's supposed to work, and obviously this is part of the problem we have now, is that it's no longer, the government doesn't want to treat it the same way.
[00:30:56.047 --> 00:31:01.471]  So basically at that time, Congress, they recognized that we need to establish what these guys have in the way of rights.
[00:31:01.511 --> 00:31:06.594]  So early on, they established that the miner had the right to go out and find these minerals.
[00:31:06.634 --> 00:31:12.478]  He had the right to develop his property for his benefit, which in turn would benefit the nation.
[00:31:13.318 --> 00:31:21.684]  And in return, he would have some protection under the law from whether it's the government or other miners or other users.
[00:31:21.764 --> 00:31:23.845]  And basically what they recognized was that
[00:31:24.654 --> 00:31:31.700]  In addition to that, early on, the miners had what they called exclusive possession and enjoyment of their property within the lines of their claim.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:38.746]  And the way it works, you go out upon the land, you find an area that's unclaimed, and you go out there and you look for minerals.
[00:31:38.786 --> 00:31:47.133]  And if you find a valuable deposit of them that you think is worth your time doing, you have the right to claim that.
[00:31:47.273 --> 00:31:52.378]  And that's done by filing a location, posting a location notice on the site,
[00:31:53.343 --> 00:31:58.927]  So just kind of recording it just like you would if you're going to buy land to put your house on.
[00:31:59.407 --> 00:32:05.311]  And here in Texas, for example, it's very common when we buy a home that those mineral rights do not transfer.
[00:32:05.711 --> 00:32:07.032]  They're held by previous people.
[00:32:07.092 --> 00:32:14.337]  So we all need to understand as people are looking at this that there's different levels of property rights even on the same piece of land.
[00:32:14.397 --> 00:32:15.698]  And we also need to understand
[00:32:16.158 --> 00:32:24.080]  That a government that doesn't recognize our property rights will treat us as if we were property, will treat us as if we were slaves.
[00:32:24.361 --> 00:32:35.184]  So, to cap this up, these miners went out there about 150 years ago, and about the time of the Civil War, they're mining this, they set this up as governments.
[00:32:35.324 --> 00:32:37.645]  Congress recognizes this officially in 1872.
[00:32:37.825 --> 00:32:44.647]  But then we have this thing called the BLM that's created to ostensibly manage federal lands.
[00:32:45.487 --> 00:32:46.608]  And let's go to 1955.
[00:32:47.429 --> 00:32:55.738]  In 1955 there's a Surface Resources Act and I think this has something to do, at least the BLM is claiming that it has something to do with this particular case.
[00:32:56.059 --> 00:33:05.409]  So explain that to us and explain how this older mine, which goes back to the early 1870s, is grandfathered in and not affected by this 1955 Surface Act.
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:14.981]  Right, yeah, so the 1955 Surface Resources Act, this actually has everything to do with it, and we agree with BLM that it does have everything to do with it.
[00:33:15.692 --> 00:33:25.181]  So, in 1955, Congress was starting to recognize that there were an awful lot of people out there, they were using, they were basically what they were doing, they were abusing the mining law.
[00:33:25.422 --> 00:33:31.047]  They were using the mining law to build private hunting cabins to squat on land.
[00:33:31.167 --> 00:33:36.272]  Needless to say, there were a lot of conflicts with other people who wanted to use the public land system.
[00:33:36.352 --> 00:33:39.055]  So, Congress decided to change the mining law.
[00:33:39.893 --> 00:34:00.665]  And what they decided to do was that all claims that were located by miners and filed after that time, July 23, 1955, they did not, they had the right to use the surface, but they did not have a surface control or control of the resources and basically full willy nilly utilization of those surfaces.
[00:34:01.146 --> 00:34:04.988]  And obviously the vegetative surfaces especially is what they were referring to.
[00:34:05.008 --> 00:34:08.290]  You know, so needless to say, the claims that were filed after that,
[00:34:09.193 --> 00:34:12.637]  They changed from the original meaning within the mining law.
[00:34:12.777 --> 00:34:15.260]  And that is something that still continues to this day.
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:17.722]  But they had to deal with the claims that were already there.
[00:34:18.443 --> 00:34:20.085]  And that is where this issue comes in.
[00:34:20.125 --> 00:34:23.308]  So Congress, they came up with three ideas.
[00:34:24.049 --> 00:34:31.657]  And these ideas they came up with, these were largely suggestions of the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management.
[00:34:32.666 --> 00:34:45.282]  And the three things they came up with were, is that basically they recognized that they couldn't just tell these miners, hey, we're here now, you've had this all along, we're going to start taking your rights away.
[00:34:45.402 --> 00:34:47.564]  They didn't do that or they didn't intend to do that.
[00:34:48.486 --> 00:34:51.850]  And so basically they provided some mechanisms for the miners to either
[00:34:52.981 --> 00:35:10.409]  On one hand, they could say, I relinquish my surface rights back to the government, and I'm going to allow the general public to come out of my claimant camp here and, you know, cut firewood, things of that nature, subject to whatever the government's, whatever the agency's rules are.
[00:35:10.729 --> 00:35:11.669]  So that was one option.
[00:35:11.729 --> 00:35:17.592]  Another option was the minor could say, well, I don't really want to deal with this anymore, so I'm just going to give up my claim.
[00:35:17.632 --> 00:35:18.712]  That was the second option.
[00:35:19.073 --> 00:35:19.973]  Now, the third option,
[00:35:21.235 --> 00:35:27.757]  And this was the option that was best suited for most miners if they were serious, they could preserve their existing rights.
[00:35:28.057 --> 00:35:33.519]  And how this was done, it was done by filing with the BLM or the U.S.
[00:35:33.579 --> 00:35:35.800]  Forest Service what was called a verified statement.
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:42.563]  And the verified statement was basically the miner informing the government, hey, I am over here.
[00:35:44.435 --> 00:35:45.917]  I'm going to maintain my rights.
[00:36:04.256 --> 00:36:21.911]  Avenues where the government could go down they could challenge the validity of the claim and basically say you're not really a minor You know, you're somebody else you're a guy the mining law and needless to say the government set up guidelines that they had to follow to either Basically to take that surface away from the miners.
[00:36:22.252 --> 00:36:23.513]  Okay, that's good.
[00:36:23.633 --> 00:36:29.498]  Let's talk about this specific case the sugar pine mine This is the one we have the conflict
[00:36:30.792 --> 00:36:43.784]  Am I correct to say that the BLM is saying that because we're exercising these surface rights regulations, and yet you're saying that the Sugar Pine Mine has already registered in a grandfather clause position, right?
[00:36:43.964 --> 00:36:44.404]  Is that correct?
[00:36:45.145 --> 00:36:46.166]  That's correct.
[00:36:46.186 --> 00:36:51.250]  So the Sugar Pine is actually, it was the first hard rock gold mine discovered in the state of Oregon.
[00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:52.651]  And that was back in 1858.
[00:36:53.332 --> 00:36:54.913]  And it went through some assorted owners.
[00:36:55.994 --> 00:37:19.832]  Between 1858 and 1876, and there was a lot of changes of ownership, and even though sometimes the mine wasn't being worked, there were miners who had various property interests on the claims, such as there were two erastas on the property, there were some ditches previous miners had dug, there was a water wheel on it at that time, and needless to say, a lot of those rights, they were preserved, but on February 9th, 1876,
[00:37:22.479 --> 00:37:32.966]  There were two men by the name of George Green and Dan Devilbiss and they decided that they wanted ownership of the Sugar Pine and they adhered to the mining law and they did what they were required to do.
[00:37:33.026 --> 00:37:39.070]  They went up there and they discovered minerals and they basically staked and recorded their claims.
[00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:41.112]  So they recorded that in 1976.
[00:37:44.865 --> 00:37:52.551]  And they also arranged with some previous owners as far as those ditches and things of that nature, which were property, to obtain them.
[00:37:52.991 --> 00:37:58.455]  So that is, this mine has been active and has maintained a current chain of title.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:10.069]  Since those two individuals, February 9th, 1876, Dan Devilbiss, who was a co-locator on that claim, he actually sold out to George Green's brothers.
[00:38:10.369 --> 00:38:10.969]  Let's go back.
[00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:11.570]  Let's go back.
[00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:13.552]  I understand it's had a long chain of command.
[00:38:13.592 --> 00:38:19.056]  Let's go back to what just happened in March with the cease and desist order from the BLM.
[00:38:19.116 --> 00:38:26.202]  Tell us about what the BLM is saying, or can you, I've seen from your press releases, you're saying that you can't get any specific information from them.
[00:38:26.602 --> 00:38:33.063]  As to what the legal basis is for them to say that the Sugar Pine Mine needs to cease and desist operation?
[00:38:34.504 --> 00:38:35.804]  Well, it's both.
[00:38:35.944 --> 00:38:38.045]  I'll tell you what actually started this.
[00:38:38.105 --> 00:38:43.926]  The owners have been actively under current ownership for three years.
[00:38:43.966 --> 00:38:46.426]  They've owned the mine for three years from the previous owner.
[00:38:46.446 --> 00:38:49.687]  And we have a complete chain of title all the way back.
[00:38:49.767 --> 00:38:53.608]  And they've spent a lot of money and we've all spent a lot of time
[00:38:54.341 --> 00:38:56.202]  Doing research to establish that.
[00:38:56.302 --> 00:38:59.823]  And BLM does not dispute that the chain of title was that long.
[00:39:00.243 --> 00:39:01.643]  That's one thing to point out.
[00:39:01.743 --> 00:39:03.184]  Even they don't dispute that.
[00:39:04.544 --> 00:39:14.427]  And basically what happened was, off and on, George Backus, who was one of the co-owners, he actually had fairly regular contact with BLM since he became the owner.
[00:39:14.447 --> 00:39:19.569]  And even before, because there's quite a bit to the situation, and needless to say, he was in contact with them.
[00:39:20.339 --> 00:39:27.724]  And he had even spoken to employees such as Diane Perry at Medford BLM, which is our local BLM district here.
[00:39:28.524 --> 00:39:39.551]  And she was quite well aware that he was there and what his intentions were and that basically, you know, George's background, he has a lot of heavy equipment operation background as far as road building.
[00:39:39.571 --> 00:39:43.894]  That's what George used to do was he used to build logging roads until the timber industry was destroyed here.
[00:39:44.474 --> 00:39:46.295]  So needless to say, they were very well aware of that.
[00:39:46.335 --> 00:39:47.476]  What kind of sparked this
[00:39:49.315 --> 00:40:05.426]  Even though George had actually maintained pretty routine contact with the local BLM people, and I've spoken in the past to local archaeologists and stuff, and they were certainly aware of George's ownership, and I think they kind of had a basic idea.
[00:40:05.446 --> 00:40:09.689]  Yeah, give us an idea, because we're going to run out of time shortly here.
[00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:13.512]  Kirby, give us an idea of what the BLM is saying.
[00:40:13.572 --> 00:40:16.814]  Certainly they recognize that this is a very long chain of title.
[00:40:17.315 --> 00:40:18.856]  What are they complaining about here?
[00:40:20.847 --> 00:40:43.663]  Basically, what happened is there were two of their employees came out to the area and they actually ran into the mine caretaker, but opposed to going to his front door and knocking on the front door and saying, hey, we're BLM guys, we're here, we have to do some work in the area, they basically disregarded that and they started poking around the camp and didn't identify themselves when they left.
[00:40:44.123 --> 00:40:45.084]  And the caretaker
[00:40:45.874 --> 00:40:46.354]  We're good to go.
[00:41:06.124 --> 00:41:08.645]  So basically they challenged their authority and that made them mad?
[00:41:08.705 --> 00:41:10.587]  Is that what you believe instigated all this?
[00:41:10.607 --> 00:41:12.248]  That's pretty much what it is.
[00:41:12.528 --> 00:41:24.114]  Basically as these two guys were coming out, they were on quads behind two locked gates and the caretaker took his truck, he blocked the road and he stepped out in front of the truck and he had a pistol at his side in his hand.
[00:41:24.154 --> 00:41:33.199]  He didn't have a holster, but he just held his pistol at his side and he waited for him and they rolled up and he said, I'm the caretaker here, I need to know who you are and what you're doing.
[00:41:33.219 --> 00:41:34.980]  You're running around the camp taking photos.
[00:41:35.341 --> 00:41:35.781]  And they said,
[00:41:36.545 --> 00:41:37.886]  We're BLM employees.
[00:41:37.946 --> 00:41:40.208]  And he said, OK, I would like you to identify yourself.
[00:41:40.268 --> 00:41:41.569]  I want some identification.
[00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:43.611]  And they said, well, we don't have to do that.
[00:41:43.631 --> 00:41:45.012]  And he said, no, you really do.
[00:41:45.052 --> 00:41:46.973]  He says, you know, tell me who you are.
[00:41:47.293 --> 00:41:52.217]  So they showed their cards and they did identify themselves as two BLM archaeologists.
[00:41:52.798 --> 00:41:54.039]  And he said, OK, that's fine.
[00:41:54.079 --> 00:41:54.419]  He said,
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:56.740]  You guys have a job to do.
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.941]  You guys can, you know, pretty much do as you need.
[00:41:58.981 --> 00:42:01.902]  But he said, in the future, he says, this is a pre-55 claim.
[00:42:01.942 --> 00:42:03.402]  He says, we do have surface rights.
[00:42:03.882 --> 00:42:10.444]  He says, in the future, please call the owner or he says, come out here and knock on the door and just let me know you're out here so I know who you are.
[00:42:10.544 --> 00:42:16.406]  And, you know, if you guys are out in the woods and you don't come back for a reason that, you know, if you guys get in trouble, I could help you guys out.
[00:42:16.906 --> 00:42:21.747]  So then you start getting unexplained bureaucratic charges brought against you after that.
[00:42:21.887 --> 00:42:30.428]  Kind of what happened was, instead of these guys saying, hey that's very reasonable, they went back and they actually filed a complaint about the caretaker and they basically said he threatened them.
[00:42:31.129 --> 00:42:32.629]  Which he did not.
[00:42:32.709 --> 00:42:36.890]  He has signed an affidavit of record that he did not do that.
[00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:43.731]  They basically stick the BLM special agent on him and he is a very young guy, very hardworking.
[00:42:43.791 --> 00:42:44.171]  He's in his 20s.
[00:42:46.418 --> 00:42:55.743]  He actually took over as caretaker because he had some equipment at his mine actually stolen and he kind of really didn't have a lot to do so that's why he got together with George and Rick and they brought him in there.
[00:42:56.023 --> 00:42:59.064]  Let's talk about where we're almost out of time.
[00:42:59.344 --> 00:43:00.805]  Hang on Kirby, we're almost out of time.
[00:43:00.985 --> 00:43:03.466]  Let's get to where we are currently at this point.
[00:43:03.866 --> 00:43:14.131]  They've hired a legal counsel who's tried to ask the BLM why they're getting a cease and desist order and of course as I mentioned at the beginning the BLM gave them a deadline of the 25th
[00:43:15.091 --> 00:43:24.418]  Which is a week from Saturday to get out and to basically remove all equipment, destroy all buildings, and fill in the mine tunnels.
[00:43:24.978 --> 00:43:27.620]  So tell us exactly where this is at the moment.
[00:43:28.681 --> 00:43:30.643]  So that's exactly what happened.
[00:43:30.663 --> 00:43:37.648]  There was a lot of going back and forth, us requesting information, them not supplying it, Freedom of Information Act requests being ignored.
[00:43:38.268 --> 00:43:42.611]  So then they send this notice of non-compliance saying you guys need to stop, we're going to do this if you don't.
[00:43:45.345 --> 00:43:47.306]  The owners, they consulted with an attorney.
[00:43:47.346 --> 00:43:49.087]  So that is where that situation is.
[00:43:49.727 --> 00:43:53.909]  And in the meantime, despite that, BLM continue to keep coming out there.
[00:43:53.949 --> 00:43:56.630]  They're basically sending law enforcement guys out.
[00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:59.431]  They're harassing the caretaker.
[00:43:59.451 --> 00:44:02.092]  You know, they're calling him constantly saying, we want a meeting.
[00:44:02.132 --> 00:44:02.832]  We want a meeting.
[00:44:02.872 --> 00:44:04.473]  And he says, I don't have to meet with you.
[00:44:04.533 --> 00:44:05.453]  I did nothing wrong.
[00:44:05.493 --> 00:44:10.235]  And I have a right to, you know, not speak to you in this country.
[00:44:10.655 --> 00:44:14.197]  And kind of where it went from there is one day,
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:41.293]  George and the caretaker were on the mine and there were two BLM law enforcement guys turned up and one of them was a county deputy by the name of Jason Stanton and he's actually a he's a deputy you know and we had actually uh we've had meetings with the county sheriffs here we've had a very good relationship with him and he came out and he says uh you know you guys got a stop order he says uh I'm here to give you another one you know I knew I do know that
[00:44:42.369 --> 00:44:50.855]  The owners, they really believed that they were there to engage in some nefarious activities to see if they were gone and basically either seize property or burn property.
[00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:56.759]  And George, the owner, he tells the deputy, he says, that's fine if you want to give me a piece of paper.
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:04.084]  And he tells the deputy, he says, I want you to realize, he says, I'm doing my best here to follow the law as I know it.
[00:45:04.184 --> 00:45:04.524]  He says,
[00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:15.993]  You know, we really believe in the Constitution, and he says, we've really done and went out of our way to work with you and try to get information, and the deputy says, I have a very large problem with the Constitution.
[00:45:16.093 --> 00:45:17.813]  I have a big problem with that idea.
[00:45:18.193 --> 00:45:18.533]  Oh, really?
[00:45:18.573 --> 00:45:19.373]  The deputy said that?
[00:45:19.774 --> 00:45:21.614]  Now, you've got a new sheriff in town, right?
[00:45:21.654 --> 00:45:23.494]  You used to have a Sheriff Gilbertson.
[00:45:23.514 --> 00:45:29.316]  I remember he wrote a very long article about how the federal government was infringing on people's rights.
[00:45:29.736 --> 00:45:35.087]  And how it was the duty of the sheriff to stand there and protect the people locally.
[00:45:35.408 --> 00:45:38.655]  But there was an election last November and there's a new sheriff in town, right?
[00:45:39.416 --> 00:45:39.637]  Yes.
[00:45:39.917 --> 00:45:40.579]  Yes, that's true.
[00:45:41.583 --> 00:45:47.224]  And, you know, and as you said, Gil Gilbertson, he was a very big supporter of the mining community.
[00:45:47.284 --> 00:45:48.625]  He still is.
[00:45:48.745 --> 00:45:51.565]  He is quite aware of the situation.
[00:45:51.605 --> 00:45:54.286]  He has been doing what he can to help the owners.
[00:45:54.746 --> 00:45:59.027]  So we do have a new sheriff and we had actually met with him kind of before this all came to a head.
[00:45:59.047 --> 00:46:04.128]  He did come to one of our meetings and he said, you know, when he admits, he says, I really don't know a lot about this.
[00:46:04.628 --> 00:46:06.049]  He says, I don't know where I stand.
[00:46:06.129 --> 00:46:08.771]  He says, you know, I would like to get educated.
[00:46:08.791 --> 00:46:10.111]  And we said, that's great.
[00:46:10.151 --> 00:46:12.913]  You know, we're looking forward to, you know, more discussions.
[00:46:13.353 --> 00:46:16.355]  And then this kind of happened where, you know, he's in the middle of it.
[00:46:16.535 --> 00:46:20.898]  And my understanding is that he is actually doing his best to mediate this.
[00:46:20.958 --> 00:46:29.083]  And he has come out open publicly and said, you know, he has said similar, very similar to Gil Gilbertson, that I will not tolerate people
[00:46:30.231 --> 00:46:36.237]  Violating the rights and property of the local citizens that basically I am obligated to defend.
[00:46:36.638 --> 00:46:38.519]  So we're very happy about that.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:48.089]  So right now you're in a position, let's kind of sum up where you are right now, from what we've seen from Oath Keepers who were in charge of security for the area.
[00:46:48.469 --> 00:46:50.431]  They are in a security position right now.
[00:46:50.812 --> 00:46:51.873]  This is not a standoff.
[00:46:52.553 --> 00:46:57.056]  The BLM has given a deadline, but so far there's been no moves towards that.
[00:46:57.857 --> 00:47:07.003]  The Oath Keepers are asking for people who can come and help to provide security to come to the area, but other than that there is no kind of a conflict there.
[00:47:07.424 --> 00:47:09.165]  And I think it's a very calming thing.
[00:47:09.625 --> 00:47:18.911]  To have people there to provide security that I think prevents something like violence happening when there are people on both sides of the issue.
[00:47:19.332 --> 00:47:22.874]  But let's look at the bigger picture for just a moment because we're just about out of time, Kirby.
[00:47:23.655 --> 00:47:28.418]  When I was looking at this, I went back into some of the archives of the area to see what was going on.
[00:47:28.458 --> 00:47:35.983]  I got some reports from the early 90s about how, this is 20 years ago, how the BLM was really cracking down on existing mines.
[00:47:36.003 --> 00:47:38.545]  And I think it's important for people who are listening to this, a lot of people
[00:47:39.085 --> 00:47:42.027]  Think of miners, they have a very negative view of them.
[00:47:42.067 --> 00:47:45.869]  They think they've seen some of the destructive practices of open pit mining.
[00:47:46.469 --> 00:47:47.649]  That's not what's going on here.
[00:47:47.689 --> 00:47:54.033]  This is very small miners who have been working this in a more of a traditional type of posture.
[00:47:54.053 --> 00:47:54.493]  Is that correct?
[00:47:56.272 --> 00:47:56.873]  That's correct.
[00:47:56.893 --> 00:48:01.775]  They're actually working the properties in a similar way that it would have been worked in, say, the 30s.
[00:48:01.875 --> 00:48:05.116]  You know, they have a small excavator to clean tunnels.
[00:48:05.216 --> 00:48:06.597]  They have a cabin.
[00:48:06.617 --> 00:48:07.937]  They have a very small mill.
[00:48:07.997 --> 00:48:17.121]  They can basically go in, extract rock, dig it up off the ground with a shovel, put it in an ore car, run it out there and run it down to their mill and do things like that.
[00:48:17.221 --> 00:48:24.264]  And they have some larger equipment to maintain roads and obviously deal with, you know, large quantities of rock that may be left in piles that need moved.
[00:48:24.921 --> 00:48:29.892]  Okay, so things really haven't changed from the articles that I was looking at 20 years ago.
[00:48:30.543 --> 00:48:33.805]  But I thought it was interesting to see this LA Times article from 1994.
[00:48:34.065 --> 00:48:45.851]  They talked to a guy, his name was Jeff Garcia, and he was a geologist from Berkeley, and he talked about how he had worked a mine there at that time in 1994.
[00:48:46.131 --> 00:48:51.413]  He'd worked it for 16 years, and basically they were making it impossible for him to continue operation.
[00:48:51.693 --> 00:48:57.736]  He had to pay a $300 permit because water was falling on his land and might cause runoff into the river.
[00:48:58.977 --> 00:49:04.901]  Which, of course, other operations, farmers don't have to do that and shouldn't have to do that.
[00:49:05.421 --> 00:49:08.783]  And yet they give exemptions to large municipal areas.
[00:49:09.143 --> 00:49:14.406]  But I thought it was very interesting that they hit him with very stiff fines just because he had some sediment runoff.
[00:49:14.686 --> 00:49:22.331]  This was not the kind of heat bleaching that some environmentalists have complained about that's been banned in some countries where they basically create a large open pit.
[00:49:22.731 --> 00:49:26.594]  They excavate everything, they pulverize everything, and then pour cyanide over it.
[00:49:26.894 --> 00:49:28.355]  This is nothing at all like this.
[00:49:28.675 --> 00:49:32.818]  This is, as you pointed out, traditional mining done by small operators.
[00:49:32.858 --> 00:49:38.202]  This guy spent half of his year in Alaska, half of it in Oregon with his wife, who is also a geologist.
[00:49:38.462 --> 00:49:41.004]  He had a lot of respect for the land, and he said this, Kirby.
[00:49:41.024 --> 00:49:44.326]  He said, society seems to have this guilt about disturbing the land.
[00:49:44.606 --> 00:49:47.308]  They still go to their big parking lots and their supermarkets.
[00:49:47.688 --> 00:49:53.456]  But if they have a chance to get rid of their guilt and nail some little miner on the hill, they feel like they've done their part to save the world.
[00:49:53.896 --> 00:49:56.580]  I think people need to see this in the proper context.
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:03.148]  They need to understand that this is part of the government's operations to shut down everybody's business.
[00:50:03.368 --> 00:50:09.674]  Whether you're a small-time miner, or whether you're a small-time retailer, or small-time manufacturer, they want to get the people out of it.
[00:50:10.034 --> 00:50:16.139]  But there's something else on these lands where people have had mineral rights, or grazing rights, or lumber rights.
[00:50:16.179 --> 00:50:26.068]  There's another aspect to this, and I think we can see it in what's going on in Arizona, where Senator John McCain just ran through in the National Defense Authorization Act.
[00:50:26.828 --> 00:50:37.235]  A process that is going to turn over an area that has recreational significance, it has historical significance to the Indians, and it has religious significance to the Indians who are there.
[00:50:37.495 --> 00:50:42.959]  And it was also protected in 1955, the same year that your stuff got grandfathered in.
[00:50:43.539 --> 00:50:49.823]  What they're going to do is by turning it over to this foreign corporation, they're totally going to obliterate the area.
[00:50:49.863 --> 00:50:53.745]  This is not something where they're going in and just mining some minerals from underneath the surface.
[00:50:53.965 --> 00:50:57.027]  They're going to create a crater that can be seen from space.
[00:50:57.667 --> 00:50:59.448]  And this is what I think is going to happen.
[00:50:59.488 --> 00:51:00.629]  I want to get your opinion on this.
[00:51:01.049 --> 00:51:05.752]  This is what I think the end game is in all of these struggles running the people off the land.
[00:51:05.792 --> 00:51:09.214]  Because when we were at the Bundy Ranch, he was the last rancher still in business.
[00:51:09.574 --> 00:51:16.699]  They had run everybody else out of business with phony endangered species claims, and of course the desert tortoise that they were supposed to be protecting.
[00:51:16.979 --> 00:51:31.149]  They had rounded these things up, euthanized over a thousand of them because they said they didn't have the money to feed them, yet they were financing an army to come against the Bundy family and to come against people who would be on the land without their specific permission.
[00:51:31.629 --> 00:51:33.911]  Attacking and assaulting people who were doing it.
[00:51:33.931 --> 00:51:36.593]  So when people go onto the BLM's land,
[00:51:37.153 --> 00:51:48.981]  They felt they had a right to assault and attack people, and yet when the BLM goes on to a gated property there in the Gleese Mining District, they get very upset if they're even asked to provide identification.
[00:51:51.162 --> 00:51:52.623]  I do want to clarify something there.
[00:51:53.324 --> 00:51:56.546]  It's actually not BLM's land, this is actually land that...
[00:51:56.994 --> 00:52:03.819]  This is actually land that is, it is administrated and managed by the United States government for the benefit of the American people.
[00:52:04.079 --> 00:52:04.660]  I misspoke.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.821]  Yes, that's a very good point.
[00:52:05.901 --> 00:52:06.982]  It's not their land.
[00:52:07.102 --> 00:52:25.496]  Under the Constitution, the federal government is very limited in what it can own and basically this is where the mining law came in and the Homestead Act came in is that basically the government was required under the law to dispose of this land and basically what that means is pass into private ownership and basically allow the average person to benefit from it and basically
[00:52:26.224 --> 00:52:29.566]  Make a living and make some sort of life for himself from it.
[00:52:29.927 --> 00:52:32.108]  And in turn, do something for the country.
[00:52:32.669 --> 00:52:34.590]  It's funny you mention Jeff Garcia.
[00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:37.412]  Jeff is actually a pretty good friend of ours.
[00:52:37.492 --> 00:52:39.173]  He is still there in Belize.
[00:52:39.233 --> 00:52:40.594]  He's still going strong.
[00:52:41.435 --> 00:52:42.536]  But you're right.
[00:52:42.876 --> 00:52:44.317]  It is exactly as he said.
[00:52:45.498 --> 00:52:47.639]  You know, I remember a comment he made to me one time.
[00:52:47.679 --> 00:52:52.803]  He said, when you're in court with these people, he said, you realize you're the only one sitting there not getting paid that day.
[00:52:54.105 --> 00:52:54.485]  That's right.
[00:52:54.705 --> 00:52:55.566]  They starve you out.
[00:52:55.686 --> 00:52:56.867]  Thank you for correcting me.
[00:52:56.987 --> 00:52:59.369]  You're very, very right about that.
[00:52:59.929 --> 00:53:08.134]  And I am aware of the situation down there in Arizona with the Apache land, and that is not something that we support.
[00:53:08.195 --> 00:53:17.701]  I mean, obviously we do support mining and we recognize that, you know, we need the minerals and our society, we do utilize a lot of minerals, almost everything we use.
[00:53:18.689 --> 00:53:20.710]  Is a mineral, you know, it derives from it.
[00:53:20.751 --> 00:53:26.154]  You know, basically, you know, we all, we're all there, you know, we all always say, if it can't be grown, it must be mined.
[00:53:26.174 --> 00:53:27.115]  So we do need the minerals.
[00:53:27.135 --> 00:53:38.603]  But at the same time, most of us who are in the mining community... But really, I think the issue, Kirby, is that they want to take it away from the small people who live in the community.
[00:53:38.643 --> 00:53:42.586]  They want to take the land away from the people who would manage it locally.
[00:53:42.626 --> 00:53:48.110]  And of course, that's the big issue out West as to who the land belongs to, who it should be, who the public lands...
[00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:49.291]  Should be managed by.
[00:53:49.351 --> 00:53:53.976]  And everybody is starting to wake up, I think, out West and say, these are public lands.
[00:53:54.236 --> 00:53:57.780]  They don't need to be managed by the federal government because they're doing a very poor job of it.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.926]  And they are trying to expunge all of the individuals out of the area in an Agenda 21 kind of way.
[00:54:04.187 --> 00:54:10.250]  So they can turn this over to large corporations who will obliterate it for all uses that everybody has.
[00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:14.212]  Completely destroy the area rather than use it responsibly.
[00:54:14.472 --> 00:54:18.934]  And I think if we want to have responsible use of the land, it is best done at the local level.
[00:54:18.954 --> 00:54:21.075]  So I think that's a very big movement.
[00:54:21.115 --> 00:54:27.237]  When I said the BLM land, of course, that's the way the BLM is acting as if it was their private property.
[00:54:27.538 --> 00:54:28.918]  And we need to understand that it isn't.
[00:54:29.198 --> 00:54:32.900]  And as you point out, there's constitutional cases to be made that the government
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:33.360]  I think?
[00:54:56.486 --> 00:54:57.146]  We're good to go.
[00:55:25.723 --> 00:55:27.044]  Any last comments, Kirby?
[00:55:28.125 --> 00:55:30.467]  That's absolutely correct.
[00:55:31.027 --> 00:55:35.751]  As we miners say here locally, if you don't know about property, you probably are property.
[00:55:35.951 --> 00:55:36.311]  That's right.
[00:55:36.411 --> 00:55:37.452]  Or you're going to lose it.
[00:55:38.493 --> 00:55:43.637]  Tell us how they can support your, where they can go to get information and to make a donation.
[00:55:44.868 --> 00:55:52.134]  If people want to get information as far as what's going on at the mine and how they can help, they should go to Oath Keepers J-O-C-O.
[00:55:52.174 --> 00:55:52.954]  That's J-O-C-O.
[00:55:52.974 --> 00:55:56.057]  Oath Keepers J-O-C-O dot com.
[00:55:56.497 --> 00:55:58.098]  And that is Josephine County Oath Keepers.
[00:55:58.138 --> 00:55:59.519]  They are the on the ground guys.
[00:55:59.699 --> 00:56:04.203]  You know, they do have needs if people want to support them with with food and things of that nature.
[00:56:04.663 --> 00:56:06.604]  Please go there, get in touch with their people.
[00:56:06.624 --> 00:56:11.228]  If you want to support the mine owners, please go to Sugar Pine Mine dot com.
[00:56:12.262 --> 00:56:13.783]  And that is the official website.
[00:56:13.803 --> 00:56:16.065]  You can also go to GileseMining.com.
[00:56:16.105 --> 00:56:17.246]  That is our district site.
[00:56:17.326 --> 00:56:18.247]  Either one of those sites.
[00:56:18.287 --> 00:56:19.488]  We have a lot of information.
[00:56:19.508 --> 00:56:28.656]  If you go to Sugar PineMine.com, you can send the miners a donation either by check directly to the owners or you can contribute through PayPal through there.
[00:56:29.717 --> 00:56:33.120]  And the thing I really want to reiterate is
[00:56:33.996 --> 00:56:40.398]  That, you know, as I mentioned earlier, I'm very close to the two owners of this mine, and they're not the only miners in this area under attack.
[00:56:40.719 --> 00:56:43.140]  There's actually several others that they're having problems.
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:46.381]  They're not to this level, but these are the two guys who've stood up.
[00:56:46.401 --> 00:56:49.782]  I was actually on the mine yesterday with one of the owners.
[00:56:49.822 --> 00:56:52.463]  He's a good friend of mine, and we were standing there.
[00:56:52.483 --> 00:57:02.547]  There's a very old stamp mill on the mine that's been there for many years, and they have a title to it, and we were looking at that, and he said, you know, he says, as long as I'm alive, he says,
[00:57:03.354 --> 00:57:04.655]  That is always going to be there.
[00:57:05.336 --> 00:57:06.857]  Well, I hope it is.
[00:57:06.877 --> 00:57:09.939]  I hope that they will respect your property rights.
[00:57:09.959 --> 00:57:11.100]  I hope you prevail in court.
[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:14.042]  I hope this goes through peacefully, but we'll keep an eye on this.
[00:57:14.423 --> 00:57:17.125]  And we'll be having an interview with the Oath Keepers.
[00:57:17.185 --> 00:57:22.529]  We are trying to establish contact with a couple of individuals there that we'll have on for interviews in the next couple of days.
[00:57:22.869 --> 00:57:24.130]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:26.712]  Kirby Jackson with the Glease Mining District.
[00:57:26.832 --> 00:57:28.813]  And of course, what they're trying to do
[00:57:29.674 --> 00:57:41.502]  Is get a legal hearing to go through the legal process to stop the BLM from acting precipitously by giving them a deadline before they've given them answers, before they've had their hearing, before they have taken this through the court.
[00:57:42.022 --> 00:57:45.144]  And that's the important function that's being done now by the Oath Keepers.
[00:57:45.204 --> 00:57:52.209]  Essentially setting up security to let them know that there's somebody there in case they're going to try to storm the area.
[00:57:52.509 --> 00:57:57.152]  Hopefully that will stop that from happening so this can take its way all the way through the court.
[00:57:57.492 --> 00:57:58.774]  Well, that's it for our news tonight.
