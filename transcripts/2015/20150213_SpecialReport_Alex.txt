[00:00:11.192 --> 00:00:12.772]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:15.433]  Now today I saw a video that's going pretty viral.
[00:00:15.813 --> 00:00:33.938]  It is of a grandmother, an older lady, Arabic lady, who was telling ISIS, you know, some soldiers for ISIS, that what they're doing is not of Allah, that God would not condone these acts of violence, terrorism, beheading people, burning people, executing people by the thousands.
[00:00:34.438 --> 00:00:39.580]  All over the country for this caliphate that they say is gonna rise and take over the world.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.821]  This lady tells them to turn back to God and basically that they're a bunch of garbage and trash.
[00:00:44.181 --> 00:00:52.564]  There's a very interesting part in the video, I don't know if a lot of people have caught it, but in the video the grandmother says that, why are you using the weapons of the Americans?
[00:00:52.604 --> 00:00:54.064]  We know that you're getting them from them.
[00:00:54.404 --> 00:00:57.545]  And the ISIS soldiers go, yes, you're right grandmother about that.
[00:00:57.765 --> 00:01:02.527]  We've been saying this for a long time, that ISIS is funded by the CIA, by American government.
[00:01:02.887 --> 00:01:04.188]  We've shown you time and time again.
[00:01:04.248 --> 00:01:09.149]  I mean, Hillary Clinton came out and said that, yes, you know, Al Qaeda, we funded them.
[00:01:09.309 --> 00:01:11.090]  You know, we were the ones who helped start them.
[00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.451]  The people we are fighting today, we funded 20 years ago.
[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:25.602]  The entire world sees this, except for the sheeple in America, the ones who just turn on Fox or CNN and believe whatever propaganda BS is being pushed in their face.
[00:01:26.322 --> 00:01:35.164]  And, you know, the funny thing is, is President Obama could literally get on TV, say that we started ISIS, and half of the people in America would not even listen to that.
[00:01:35.224 --> 00:01:39.405]  They would just go ahead and flip over to the Kardashian Show or The Simpsons or something like that.
[00:01:39.846 --> 00:01:42.111]  And ignore the truth right here in front of them.
[00:01:42.432 --> 00:01:48.586]  That our government is about to send more soldiers in to fight a group of terrorists that we created.
[00:01:50.054 --> 00:01:53.596]  More American lives are going to be lost over something like this, and this is ridiculous.
[00:01:53.916 --> 00:01:56.077]  This is something that we've got to stand up and say no to.
[00:01:56.517 --> 00:01:58.858]  All these wars are leading to nothing.
[00:01:58.878 --> 00:01:59.779]  They've been for nothing.
[00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:00.799]  They're a waste of time.
[00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:03.140]  But let's go ahead and get to the video.
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.141]  Watch the video.
[00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:14.506]  Tell me what you think afterwards like this, and please share it with people who actually think that ISIS is just this organization that just came up out of nowhere and is now dominating the Middle East.
[00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:15.727]  Fear God!
[00:02:15.867 --> 00:02:16.407]  Fear God!
[00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:18.729]  You don't want slaughter, you don't want killing!
[00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:19.909]  The Jews are attacking!
[00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:22.911]  Prepare for them what you can from your strength!
[00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:27.715]  And from the rope of the horse, which you use to intimidate the enemy of God and your enemy!
[00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:33.218]  On the day of the battle of Zaire, I'm the one who wants to hide my son from the Russians, I don't want to see them!
[00:02:33.258 --> 00:02:37.841]  But the day you get American money and weapons, you want to kill each other!
[00:02:39.382 --> 00:02:40.503]  We're good to go.
[00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:06.072]  We're good to go.
[00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.170]  On the market.
[00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:35.055]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:40.238]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[00:03:40.378 --> 00:03:43.981]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:03:44.301 --> 00:03:50.588]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:03:50.928 --> 00:03:55.913]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
