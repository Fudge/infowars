[00:00:00.802 --> 00:00:08.319]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live on Monday, the 14th day of December 2015, and here's a key report on the takeover of transportation.
[00:00:09.215 --> 00:00:21.178]  During the Christmas holiday back in 1913, Congress enacted a communistic centralization of your money, transferred to the control of an elite few.
[00:00:21.178 --> 00:00:22.958]  Communistic, you say?
[00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:31.380]  Well, the second plank of the Communist Manifesto states a heavy progressive or graduated income tax.
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.921]  The fifth plank states
[00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:42.028]  Centralization of credit in the hands of the state by means of a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly.
[00:00:42.028 --> 00:00:45.710]  Those planks have been long established in the United States.
[00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.814]  So it stands to reason that we are living in a somewhat communist country.
[00:00:50.814 --> 00:00:54.137]  Of course, all of the planks, if researched.
[00:00:54.597 --> 00:00:57.240]  Apply to the current state of government in the U.S.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.402]  in one way, shape, or form.
[00:00:59.402 --> 00:01:01.764]  For instance, Plank No.
[00:01:01.764 --> 00:01:02.205]  6.
[00:01:02.205 --> 00:01:07.450]  Centralization of the means of communication and transportation in the hands of the state.
[00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.857]  Of course, the FCC is all over the control of communications, not to mention the NSA and your friendly neighborhood fusion center.
[00:01:15.037 --> 00:01:28.306]  And a lot of socialist-controlled examples, such as the Postal Service and the government's control of Amtrak and Conrail, represents the government's hand being placed in the free enterprise cookie jar for the world to see.
[00:01:28.306 --> 00:01:33.049]  But that's only the beginning of where government-controlled transportation is heading.
[00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:40.735]  The Huffington Post reports, there's growing confusion about how would-be flyers from Louisiana, Minnesota, New Hampshire and New York
[00:01:41.095 --> 00:01:52.224]  will board planes when provisions of the Real ID Act go into effect because their state ID and driver's license processes fail to meet federal standards.
[00:01:52.224 --> 00:02:02.451]  Passengers from those four states would likely need a passport or in the case of non-citizens, immigration documents for air travel within the United States.
[00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:04.873]  The rules raise several concerns.
[00:02:04.873 --> 00:02:09.197]  There's the expense of acquiring a passport or other approved document.
[00:02:09.197 --> 00:02:10.998]  Then there's the potential for disorder
[00:02:10.998 --> 00:02:11.478]  I don't know.
[00:02:31.286 --> 00:02:37.709]  Must present proper identification issued by real ID compliant states.
[00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:46.694]  DHS continues, to be clear this update does not affect identification shown at the airports in the United States until announced otherwise.
[00:02:47.014 --> 00:02:54.260]  The TSA will continue to accept valid driver's license and ID cards issued by all states.
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:09.374]  DHS plans to announce the schedule for any changes to air travel requirements by the end of the year and will ensure that state governments and the traveling public are notified at least 120 days in advance of implementation.
[00:03:09.654 --> 00:03:17.979]  In the very near and real future, a real-life controlled matrix where transportation is no longer an individual right.
[00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:32.068]  CNN reports, Ford says the newest edition of its X-Maxx car has a new technology that scans traffic signs and adjusts the throttle to help drivers stay within legal speed limits and avoid fines.
[00:03:32.068 --> 00:03:35.670]  But the automated cars won't be obeying the speed limits.
[00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.711]  BBC reports,
[00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:46.259]  Google's self-driving cars are programmed to exceed speed limits by up to 10 miles per hour, according to the project's lead software engineer.
[00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:57.510]  Dmitry Dolgov told Reuters that when surrounding vehicles were breaking the speed limit, going more slowly could actually present a danger, and the Google car would accelerate to keep up.
[00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:06.659]  Of course, Google just wants you pesky humans to know that all 16 and counting reported self-driving car accidents weren't their fault.
[00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:12.905]  It was the fault of those meddling humans that reek of racial guilt and outdated individual freedom.
[00:04:12.905 --> 00:04:18.290]  The Daily Mail reports Google's self-driving car has been involved in several accidents since it was launched.
[00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.631]  All caused by humans, its testers claim.
[00:04:21.631 --> 00:04:34.495]  Driving a big, beautiful speed demon anywhere you want, without Big Brother sitting in the passenger seat, is simply one of those fading American rights that should awaken even the most jaded American mind.
[00:04:34.495 --> 00:04:40.117]  Freedom to move, when, how, and where you want to in the United States is priceless.
[00:04:40.117 --> 00:04:45.039]  Until the socialistic, communistic, corporacratic New World Order buys up that freedom,
[00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:50.065]  And hands it over to their next installed puppet dictator with a big red bow on it.
[00:04:50.065 --> 00:04:57.873]  I suppose jolly old Nick better get his self-driving sleigh upgraded so the NSA can check their list to make sure if he's been naughty or nice.
[00:04:57.873 --> 00:04:59.735]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:05:00.196 --> 00:05:04.019]  In response to Donald Trump's proposal to ban non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S.
[00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:11.986]  without being properly vetted, Senate Democrats may attempt to create a so-called civil right for anyone, including ISIS militants, to immigrate to the U.S.
[00:05:11.986 --> 00:05:16.610]  Senator Pat Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, proposed an amendment to Title 18 of the U.S.
[00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:27.879]  Code to stop the federal government from banning individuals from entering into the United States based on their religion, which would create a dangerous precedent where illegal aliens could claim immigration laws preventing their entry into the U.S.
[00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:29.140]  violate their civil rights.
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:45.125]  In response to the amendment, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions said, quote, It is a move towards the ratification of the idea that global migration is a so-called human right, and that the so-called immigrant's rights must be supreme to the rights of sovereign nations to determine who can and cannot enter their borders.
[00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:54.849]  Sessions also warned that any alien-denied entry could file suits to ban entry and claim damages for lost employment, lost welfare benefits, lost income, etc.

[00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:58.590]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:14.567]  My fellow patriots, one of the things I'm most proud of is the fact that the InfoWars operation reaches more than 20 million people a week worldwide with the message of liberty, and none of it is funded by major global corporations or by taxpayers.
[00:06:14.567 --> 00:06:16.407]  It's funded by free will.

[00:06:59.912 --> 00:07:03.115]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[00:08:04.531 --> 00:08:06.072]  It's never gonna get any better.
[00:08:06.072 --> 00:08:07.213]  Don't look for it.
[00:08:07.213 --> 00:08:09.474]  Be happy with what you got.
[00:08:09.474 --> 00:08:13.097]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[00:08:13.097 --> 00:08:15.138]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[00:08:15.138 --> 00:08:16.279]  The real owners.
[00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:21.182]  The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[00:08:21.182 --> 00:08:22.643]  Forget the politicians.
[00:08:22.643 --> 00:08:27.486]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[00:08:27.486 --> 00:08:27.866]  You don't.
[00:08:28.684 --> 00:08:30.045]  You have no choice.
[00:08:30.045 --> 00:08:31.286]  You have owners.
[00:08:31.286 --> 00:08:33.548]  They own you.
[00:08:33.548 --> 00:08:35.089]  They own everything.
[00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:37.090]  They own all the important land.
[00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:38.871]  They own and control the corporations.
[00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:42.354]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, and City Halls.
[00:08:42.354 --> 00:08:44.275]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[00:08:44.275 --> 00:08:49.259]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[00:08:49.259 --> 00:08:50.900]  They got you by the balls!
[00:08:52.396 --> 00:08:54.937]  They want obedient workers.
[00:08:54.937 --> 00:08:56.738]  Obedient workers.
[00:08:56.738 --> 00:09:09.503]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[00:09:09.503 --> 00:09:13.225]  And now, they're coming for your social security money.
[00:09:13.225 --> 00:09:17.307]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:19.208]  It's a big club.
[00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:19.988]  And you ain't in it.
[00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:24.560]  You and I are not in the big club.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.145]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[00:09:27.145 --> 00:09:30.872]  It's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[00:09:32.276 --> 00:09:34.138]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[00:09:34.138 --> 00:09:37.642]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[00:09:37.642 --> 00:09:41.587]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[00:09:41.587 --> 00:09:42.829]  They're not interested in that.
[00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:44.150]  That doesn't help them.
[00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.032]  That's against their interest.
[00:09:46.032 --> 00:09:47.034]  That's right.
[00:09:47.034 --> 00:09:52.100]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:09:54.244 --> 00:10:00.866]  We never got George Carlin on the broadcast, but we did have one of our reporters interview him, and he did not believe the official story of 9-11.
[00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:08.708]  We were actually trying to get him on, and his publicist said, no, not right now, maybe next year.
[00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:11.509]  And then a week later, he was dead of a heart attack.
[00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:13.270]  So we could see why he couldn't come on the show.
[00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.370]  He was having on and off again congestive heart failure.
[00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:17.411]  But what an incredible brain.
[00:10:18.643 --> 00:10:21.804]  I'll tell you somebody else that I was told was a listener.
[00:10:21.804 --> 00:10:25.684]  I was told by the same person that Bruce Willis was a big listener.
[00:10:25.684 --> 00:10:31.525]  And Bruce Willis had never come out and said anything about the New World Order.
[00:10:31.525 --> 00:10:37.246]  But Rick Linklater, when he made a movie with him, said that, no, Bruce Willis listens to your show, knows about your films.
[00:10:37.246 --> 00:10:40.627]  He saw a poster of you in the office and said, oh yeah, Alex Jones.
[00:10:40.627 --> 00:10:42.107]  And I've never really even reached out to Bruce Willis.
[00:10:42.107 --> 00:10:45.428]  I think we should just, like we never reached out to Trump and then they ended up kind of reaching out to us.
[00:10:45.428 --> 00:10:47.348]  We need to go ahead and just reach out to Bruce Willis.
[00:10:48.846 --> 00:10:53.668]  And, again, it's because celebrity being against tyranny is how we're going to win this fight.
[00:10:53.668 --> 00:11:09.315]  I mean, it's one of the biggest areas of propaganda where they use all these celebrities for their anti-gun, their open borders, their globalism, their anti-family agenda, when most of the people that I've run into in Hollywood are libertarians or they're paleo-conservative types.
[00:11:09.315 --> 00:11:15.118]  And then Willis did give an interview to Vanity Fair about the New World Order, government killing Kennedy, both parties controlled by globalists.
[00:11:16.198 --> 00:11:18.019]  Never even tried to get Bruce Willis on.
[00:11:18.019 --> 00:11:21.220]  And again, it's not bragging, oh, we have all these celebrities that listen to the show.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.142]  It's that most of them I run into end up being listeners.
[00:11:25.142 --> 00:11:28.143]  And that was Rick Linkletter that told me about Bruce Willis.
[00:11:28.143 --> 00:11:30.964]  And it was the same group of folks that said, oh, yeah.
[00:11:30.964 --> 00:11:35.606]  And Kurt Russell, when he comes to town, he's a big anti-New World Order guy and likes your show.
[00:11:35.606 --> 00:11:36.547]  I love Kurt Russell.
[00:11:36.547 --> 00:11:38.828]  I mean, I love every Escape from New York, The Thing.
[00:11:38.828 --> 00:11:41.049]  I mean, this is one of the best actors out there.
[00:11:41.929 --> 00:11:47.015]  And again, got a call a few weeks ago, just now reaching out.
[00:11:47.015 --> 00:11:53.242]  Missed his call, but the dude called up and is a listener.
[00:11:53.242 --> 00:11:55.524]  Again, there's just so many people that are ready to talk.
[00:11:55.524 --> 00:11:57.647]  I mean, sure, a Billy Corrigan will come on.
[00:11:57.647 --> 00:11:58.408]  He has a lot of courage.
[00:11:59.268 --> 00:12:01.709]  Or a Dave Mustaine and get demonized and attacked.
[00:12:01.709 --> 00:12:05.770]  Or a lot of the other Viggo Mortensen's come on and ended up reaching out to us as a listener.
[00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.250]  I mean it's a wide spectrum of people.
[00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:13.791]  Most of them I can't say their names because they don't want me to say their names.
[00:12:13.791 --> 00:12:18.032]  People even bigger than Kurt Russell or Jeff Bridges.
[00:12:18.032 --> 00:12:22.433]  That I've met with, that I've visited with, that I've talked to over the years.
[00:12:22.433 --> 00:12:25.374]  And they are fully awake listening almost every day.
[00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.171]  And they won't speak out, they won't get involved.
[00:12:29.171 --> 00:12:31.452]  See, Matt Drudge doesn't just speak out and get involved.
[00:12:31.452 --> 00:12:33.973]  He came here for solidarity.
[00:12:33.973 --> 00:12:35.214]  Took a lot of courage.
[00:12:35.214 --> 00:12:36.495]  The biggest guy in media.
[00:12:36.495 --> 00:12:38.115]  Biggest guy on the internet.
[00:12:38.115 --> 00:12:42.217]  And so, starting the show off today, I'm not bragging about Alex Jones.
[00:12:42.217 --> 00:12:47.160]  I want you to know how incredibly popular freedom is.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.962]  And then InfoWars is just one focal point of that, as Ron Paul pointed out.
[00:12:50.962 --> 00:12:52.402]  He said, listen, I'm not that special.
[00:12:52.402 --> 00:12:54.343]  I'm just a focal point of the Liberty Movement.
[00:12:54.343 --> 00:12:55.804]  All of us together is what's special.
[00:12:57.591 --> 00:12:58.452]  Kurt Russell.
[00:12:58.452 --> 00:12:59.272]  I want to play this again.
[00:12:59.272 --> 00:13:00.753]  They played it on Friday and Sunday.
[00:13:00.753 --> 00:13:08.798]  Kurt Russell pushes back against anti-gun Hollywood.
[00:13:08.798 --> 00:13:11.860]  And that was the Tea Partyist interviewing.
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:16.162]  And again, I had heard that Kurt Russell was anti-globalist, pro-gun, and a listener.
[00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:20.005]  I had not confirmed that, but I mean, who I heard it from, absolutely, it wouldn't make it up.
[00:13:22.506 --> 00:13:24.908]  And I just love it, the solidarity of this.
[00:13:24.908 --> 00:13:26.209]  I mean, what an awesome actor.
[00:13:26.209 --> 00:13:27.030]  What a great guy.
[00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.511]  I mean, Snake Plissken, the ultimate character.
[00:13:29.511 --> 00:13:31.573]  I could watch that movie 50 times.
[00:13:31.573 --> 00:13:32.794]  Lee Van Cleef, all of it.
[00:13:32.794 --> 00:13:36.197]  Oh my gosh, John Carpenter in his heyday was the best.
[00:13:36.197 --> 00:13:39.459]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip of Kurt Russell.
[00:13:39.459 --> 00:13:43.862]  This stuff gets really bad as the knives come out against the Second Amendment.
[00:13:43.862 --> 00:13:47.725]  More and more patriots begin to stand up, and I want to encourage them all, do more.
[00:13:47.725 --> 00:13:48.486]  Take action.
[00:13:48.486 --> 00:13:49.026]  Speak out.
[00:13:49.026 --> 00:13:49.347]  Here it is.
[00:13:50.322 --> 00:13:58.928]  Obama's point was that the guys who are on the no-fly list, no-fly list because of terrorist connections, can get a gun pretty easily.
[00:13:58.928 --> 00:14:01.210]  They can also make a bomb pretty easily.
[00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:01.570]  Yeah.
[00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:02.751]  So what?
[00:14:02.751 --> 00:14:04.252]  They can also get knives and stab you.
[00:14:04.252 --> 00:14:05.573]  What are you going to do about that?
[00:14:05.573 --> 00:14:07.014]  They can get cars and run you over with them.
[00:14:07.014 --> 00:14:08.855]  What are you going to do about that?
[00:14:08.855 --> 00:14:09.675]  What are you going to do about that?
[00:14:09.675 --> 00:14:11.457]  They didn't kill the people in San Bernardino.
[00:14:11.457 --> 00:14:13.678]  Oh, but they've killed others that way.
[00:14:13.678 --> 00:14:14.819]  Haven't they?
[00:14:14.819 --> 00:14:15.700]  Yeah.
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:15.980]  Yeah.
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.000]  So what are you going to do?
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.461]  Outlaw everything?
[00:14:18.595 --> 00:14:19.556]  That ain't the answer.
[00:14:19.556 --> 00:14:22.077]  Just put some controls.
[00:14:22.077 --> 00:14:23.338]  Put some controls?
[00:14:23.338 --> 00:14:27.861]  What, so the people who want to defend themselves can't?
[00:14:27.861 --> 00:14:29.042]  No, not so you can't.
[00:14:29.042 --> 00:14:30.984]  Just so the idiots can't get a hold of them.
[00:14:30.984 --> 00:14:32.925]  Do you really believe they're not going to?
[00:14:32.925 --> 00:14:34.006]  Are you serious about that?
[00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:35.847]  Are you seriously?
[00:14:35.847 --> 00:14:37.148]  What good will that do?
[00:14:37.148 --> 00:14:39.590]  Oh my God, you and I just disagree.
[00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.351]  You and I just disagree.
[00:14:41.351 --> 00:14:45.474]  I understand that you think that you can control
[00:14:46.349 --> 00:14:55.952]  The behavior of people that are dead set on taking your way of life away from you, I think you think you can control that?
[00:14:55.952 --> 00:14:56.473]  No.
[00:14:56.473 --> 00:15:01.994]  And there's only one thing you can do with that and say, no dude, that's not going to happen.
[00:15:01.994 --> 00:15:03.695]  That's just not going to happen.
[00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:07.176]  Good talking with you.
[00:15:07.176 --> 00:15:08.097]  Beautifully said.
[00:15:08.097 --> 00:15:10.657]  It's only one thing you say to terrorists.
[00:15:10.657 --> 00:15:13.919]  I don't care what you do, you're not taking our way of life.
[00:15:13.919 --> 00:15:14.719]  We're not scared of you.
[00:15:16.158 --> 00:15:26.725]  I mean, if terrorists blew up a major city and killed a million people with an A-bomb, will we capitulate and get rid of our Bill of Rights and Constitution and Declaration of Independence that makes this America?
[00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:32.149]  That the powerful corporate forces have been trying to dismantle forever?
[00:15:32.149 --> 00:15:33.910]  That's running up the white flag.
[00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.111]  And running up the white flag won't protect us.
[00:15:36.111 --> 00:15:41.054]  You don't get security from giving up liberty.
[00:15:41.054 --> 00:15:44.417]  So I do want to go on an initiative to get Kurt Russell on.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:56.960]  And to get Bruce Willis on and to get Jeff Bridges on because these are people I know are listeners and Bridges tried to call me.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:57.561]  But he did it over.
[00:15:58.507 --> 00:15:59.607]  I'm not going to let you down.
[00:16:21.614 --> 00:16:27.018]  You have a great reputation as a patriot fighting tyranny, and, you know, come up to New York and let's have dinner.
[00:16:27.018 --> 00:16:36.425]  You know, said that off air, but the point is, he knows that that's going to make them attack him.
[00:16:36.425 --> 00:16:40.328]  He knew all that was coming, and he knows how discredited they are.
[00:16:40.328 --> 00:16:41.789]  He wants it to blow up in their face.
[00:16:41.789 --> 00:16:45.913]  That's why they promoted the interview attacking it.
[00:16:45.913 --> 00:16:48.615]  2,600 plus articles on Google in one day, and it all ended.
[00:16:49.617 --> 00:16:53.978]  All ended on a dime, because they were like, whoa, drop that!
[00:16:53.978 --> 00:17:01.300]  They're finally getting it, like whenever Rand Paul had won the Senate, and Politico called me up and wanted to do an interview.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:06.301]  And I said, I don't usually do interviews, but I said, I'm just going to give you about a one-minute interview, and you promise you're going to quote this.
[00:17:06.301 --> 00:17:07.181]  And they said, yes.
[00:17:07.181 --> 00:17:08.581]  And they did.
[00:17:08.581 --> 00:17:10.101]  Part of it, not the whole thing.
[00:17:10.101 --> 00:17:13.722]  And I said, the only way you can defeat Rand Paul is to endorse him.
[00:17:13.722 --> 00:17:14.722]  You're out of bullets.
[00:17:14.722 --> 00:17:15.983]  No one believes you anymore.
[00:17:15.983 --> 00:17:16.643]  You are a joke.
[00:17:16.643 --> 00:17:17.163]  You're a fraud.
[00:17:21.408 --> 00:17:25.730]  And they didn't quote the whole thing when they quoted part of it.
[00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:27.011]  But they just can't help it.
[00:17:27.011 --> 00:17:38.096]  They still think they can attack with lies and twisted garbage, like the Washington Post just wrote this weekend about me saying, I believe the moon landings didn't happen, and there's no tape of me saying that.
[00:17:38.096 --> 00:17:43.118]  They just know that's a common conspiracy theory that people disdain, so they just throw it at me.
[00:17:43.118 --> 00:17:44.819]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:17:44.819 --> 00:17:46.480]  But that's why they're so discredited.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.841]  So just keep lying about me all day.
[00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:53.641]  I also believe fluoride in the water is bad.
[00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:55.823]  Well, I mean, Harvard has come out.
[00:17:55.823 --> 00:17:56.823]  That's true.
[00:17:56.823 --> 00:17:58.364]  And said, take it out of the water.
[00:17:58.364 --> 00:18:01.227]  It causes 10 point IQ reductions in just a few years.
[00:18:01.227 --> 00:18:04.109]  Seven fold increase in bone cancer in men and boys.
[00:18:04.109 --> 00:18:10.693]  Pancreatic cancer, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, blood cancer.
[00:18:10.693 --> 00:18:17.398]  On and on and on.
[00:18:17.398 --> 00:18:18.119]  It's not funny.
[00:18:19.707 --> 00:18:21.489]  It's not a joke.
[00:18:21.489 --> 00:18:26.634]  They also say, oh, and he's a vaccine denialist.
[00:18:26.634 --> 00:18:29.656]  I'm a vaccine denialist.
[00:18:29.656 --> 00:18:37.103]  I mean, my gosh, the inserts of every major vaccine say they can kill you.
[00:18:37.103 --> 00:18:43.830]  So it's very, very frustrating to sit here and have the mixed reality of what I've said and what I back up with just made up crud.
[00:18:45.962 --> 00:18:47.503]  Made up baloney.
[00:18:47.503 --> 00:18:53.427]  Sandwiches they just hand out to everybody, full of political cyanide.
[00:18:53.427 --> 00:18:59.971]  But it feels so good to see people with courage like Kurt Russell and others start to come out about the New World Order.
[00:18:59.971 --> 00:19:03.493]  And I know full well people like Bruce Willis want to as well.
[00:19:03.493 --> 00:19:08.877]  And they get, I mean you ought to see the demonization, the attacks, things David Mustaine's gone on through for coming on the show, other people.
[00:19:09.875 --> 00:19:13.196]  But at a certain point, you just got to take it and realize it's a badge of courage.
[00:19:13.196 --> 00:19:30.403]  And if we get all the libertarians and conservatives and patriots and just pro-Americana type people who aren't globalists, classical liberals, on the show or other shows, I don't care where they do it, just show that solidarity of how awake people are and how exciting this is.
[00:19:30.403 --> 00:19:34.624]  And that they get it and know what's happening and know what's going on.
[00:19:34.624 --> 00:19:36.105]  You know, Kurt Vonnegut was a big listener.
[00:19:37.623 --> 00:19:41.865]  And he did send me a painting he did for me, and he said, no, I'm done doing speeches.
[00:19:41.865 --> 00:19:42.285]  I'm done.
[00:19:42.285 --> 00:19:43.146]  I'm done with everything.
[00:19:43.146 --> 00:19:47.268]  And he was very cogent that he was dead a month later.
[00:19:47.268 --> 00:19:52.810]  So I never got Kurt Vonnegut on either, but it just shows how many great minds are awake to what's happening.
[00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:58.693]  We're going to give you the latest when we come back, how they let the terrorists into the country, more attacks in Europe by ISIS.
[00:20:00.211 --> 00:20:03.515]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[00:20:03.515 --> 00:20:09.021]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[00:20:09.021 --> 00:20:11.284]  But they're about to lose control.
[00:20:11.284 --> 00:20:16.610]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:21.075]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:20:21.175 --> 00:20:23.577]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:20:23.577 --> 00:20:27.420]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.943]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[00:20:31.943 --> 00:20:35.066]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:20:35.066 --> 00:20:37.648]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:20:37.648 --> 00:20:38.929]  This will affect us all.
[00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:44.235]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[00:20:44.235 --> 00:20:50.622]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.

[00:21:00.307 --> 00:21:11.216]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[00:21:11.216 --> 00:21:15.380]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.541]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[00:21:17.541 --> 00:21:23.006]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[00:21:23.166 --> 00:21:33.195]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[00:21:33.195 --> 00:21:39.681]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[00:21:39.681 --> 00:21:43.024]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[00:21:43.024 --> 00:21:45.086]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[00:21:45.086 --> 00:21:48.029]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[00:21:48.209 --> 00:21:50.693]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[00:22:29.406 --> 00:22:33.668]  With a new year coming, it's time for a new way to look at weapon storage.
[00:22:33.668 --> 00:22:36.910]  Safes can't be accessed quickly and racks are unsafe for children.
[00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:39.471]  Covert Cabinets are the next level in home defense.
[00:22:39.471 --> 00:22:44.933]  They fit seamlessly into any home's decor and they provide quick access to firearms while keeping them uniquely hidden.

[00:22:59.246 --> 00:23:00.207]  Hey, Berky Guy here.
[00:23:00.207 --> 00:23:02.050]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:03.812]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[00:23:03.812 --> 00:23:05.775]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?
[00:23:05.775 --> 00:23:11.782]  The Berky Guy is here to help you remove these and other potential contaminants from your water, thus helping you drink clean, purified water.

[00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.733]  Join them by visiting goberkey.com or call me, the Berkey Guy, at 877-886-3653.
[00:23:23.733 --> 00:23:23.913]  That's 877-886-3653.
[00:23:45.367 --> 00:23:47.308]  He's bound down, loaded up and truckin'!
[00:24:22.864 --> 00:24:26.507]  Print he sent me of an open birdcage.
[00:24:26.507 --> 00:24:28.730]  The bird's gone, symbol of freedom.
[00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:30.752]  That kind of goes back to the French Revolution.
[00:24:32.659 --> 00:24:39.782]  And you can see the hand-drawn face of Kurt Vonnegut right there for Alex, and then his signature down there.
[00:24:39.782 --> 00:24:42.424]  He sent me one of the little knick-knack I've got at home.
[00:24:42.424 --> 00:24:44.105]  This has been in my office for a long time.
[00:24:44.105 --> 00:24:52.169]  But again, just to show how many people are awake to the New World Order, what the globalists are up to, and what they're doing.
[00:24:52.169 --> 00:24:54.830]  And I got reached out to by Kurt Vonnegut's art partner.
[00:24:56.124 --> 00:25:08.334]  Fell out of Tennessee about it and then that's how I talked to Vonnegut down the road and then it was a couple months after I talked to him that I guess he fell and then hit his head and then died.
[00:25:08.334 --> 00:25:10.195]  But really interesting.
[00:25:10.195 --> 00:25:12.997]  And again, it's just about the amazing solidarity.
[00:25:12.997 --> 00:25:16.100]  How many patriots are out there of every stripe?
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.762]  I mean, Kurt Vonnegut would call himself a classical liberal.
[00:25:18.762 --> 00:25:20.403]  In fact, that's what he called himself.
[00:25:20.403 --> 00:25:22.165]  One of the greatest satirists ever.
[00:25:23.752 --> 00:25:31.138]  Now he's gone, but what he has produced, what he has stood for, basically goes on forever unless we extinct the species.
[00:25:31.138 --> 00:25:45.150]  And I kind of got on that jag playing the clip earlier with George Carlin and just thinking about how smart he was, how informed he was, how awake he was.
[00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:47.973]  And what a bummer it is that he's gone as well.
[00:25:49.127 --> 00:25:53.012]  Now the long segment's coming up and I'm going to get serious now.
[00:25:53.012 --> 00:26:00.461]  GOP establishment worries about Cruz Trump showdown in the debate coming up that we'll be covering live here on InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:26:00.461 --> 00:26:05.026]  How Donald Trump took the Republican Party by storm.
[00:26:05.026 --> 00:26:06.028]  We've also got
[00:26:08.291 --> 00:26:12.694]  That report, now he's still in the lead except in one state and gaining in that lead.
[00:26:12.694 --> 00:26:18.818]  And I know why Ted Cruz is gaining in one state and a few others is because Ted Cruz is really smart.
[00:26:18.818 --> 00:26:21.140]  But Ted Cruz says he's really on target.
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:27.704]  He's extremely presidential.
[00:26:27.704 --> 00:26:30.706]  And I've... Infowars has interviewed him before.
[00:26:30.706 --> 00:26:31.947]  He said he's out of Texas.
[00:26:31.947 --> 00:26:34.669]  He's a Texas Senator.
[00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:37.751]  But I've talked to some pretty high-powered people
[00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:40.910]  Multiple folks.
[00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:42.111]  Big donors, you name it.
[00:26:42.111 --> 00:26:42.771]  Billionaire types.
[00:26:42.771 --> 00:26:44.653]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:26:44.653 --> 00:26:57.802]  And they say that Cruz, in person, when you spend about two days with him, I'm just going to leave it at that, is interesting.
[00:26:57.802 --> 00:27:02.225]  They just say that they would support Rand Paul or Donald Trump.
[00:27:02.225 --> 00:27:03.686]  Two different people.
[00:27:03.686 --> 00:27:05.047]  And they've spent time with both of them.
[00:27:08.007 --> 00:27:14.189]  And I'm not here spreading rumors about Cruz because he's a little bit ahead of Trump in one state.
[00:27:14.189 --> 00:27:14.949]  I've said it before.
[00:27:14.949 --> 00:27:15.730]  I really like him.
[00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:16.350]  I admire him.
[00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:16.950]  He's amazing.
[00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:24.353]  Anybody that can talk for 26 hours without going to the bathroom fluently is incredible.
[00:27:24.353 --> 00:27:28.974]  I mean, he's got one of the longest filibusters ever.
[00:27:28.974 --> 00:27:33.756]  So I have no doubt he would be serious to contend with by any other foreign leader like Putin.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.862]  But his wife was a managing partner at Goldman Sachs.
[00:27:38.862 --> 00:27:40.503]  They are members of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:27:40.503 --> 00:27:41.444]  They got out of it.
[00:27:41.444 --> 00:27:42.504]  He said they're vipers.
[00:27:42.504 --> 00:27:43.325]  Hey, I get that.
[00:27:43.325 --> 00:27:49.589]  If somebody gets into that, learns about it, gets out of it, speaks out against it, and they do good stuff, then hey, great!
[00:27:49.589 --> 00:27:56.714]  We gotta have the attitude that if somebody's been on the other team, and they come over to our side, that we don't just immediately attack them and don't trust them.
[00:27:56.714 --> 00:28:01.397]  But, like Reagan said, trust but verify, I hope Cruz is for real.
[00:28:02.506 --> 00:28:04.948]  You know, his dad's from a communist country.
[00:28:04.948 --> 00:28:05.968]  We've done research on him.
[00:28:05.968 --> 00:28:07.469]  Joel Scalzi's done research on him.
[00:28:07.469 --> 00:28:10.912]  Going back to the time he was 14 giving anti-communist speeches, like my dad did.
[00:28:10.912 --> 00:28:17.536]  I mean, I think he's for real.
[00:28:17.536 --> 00:28:23.120]  It's just that when it comes to militarism and he wants to take down Syria, well, that's not right.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.161]  The West started that fight.
[00:28:24.161 --> 00:28:30.925]  Our own Pentagon's come out again in a huge report and said, the government is lying about who we're backing.
[00:28:30.925 --> 00:28:31.866]  This is wrong in Syria.
[00:28:32.836 --> 00:28:35.499]  And Cruz has been presented with all that.
[00:28:35.499 --> 00:28:39.643]  Rand Paul's got the right position.
[00:28:39.643 --> 00:28:40.944]  Donald Trump has the right position.
[00:28:40.944 --> 00:28:47.370]  If you want to talk to problems with Cruz, maybe we should open the phones up about Ted Cruz.
[00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:52.375]  Because he's like Obama.
[00:28:52.375 --> 00:28:53.496]  He pretty much comes from nowhere.
[00:28:54.377 --> 00:28:55.917]  He was in state government, boom, U.S.
[00:28:55.917 --> 00:28:56.738]  Senator.
[00:28:56.738 --> 00:29:00.739]  On the Tea Party wave that Ron Paul and you and I and the listeners started.
[00:29:00.739 --> 00:29:02.239]  All of us collectively.
[00:29:02.239 --> 00:29:04.920]  And I hope he's surfing this wave to victory.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.880]  He's already done it in the Senate.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:07.760]  And that he's for real.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.021]  It just means that he needs to know where he came from.
[00:29:10.021 --> 00:29:16.203]  And he needs to know that we are not going to put up with any flip-flopping.
[00:29:16.203 --> 00:29:17.823]  And we've not really seen flip-flopping out of him.
[00:29:19.292 --> 00:29:23.255]  The toll-free number on cruise is 800-259-9231.
[00:29:23.255 --> 00:29:24.457]  First-time callers, 800-259-9231.
[00:29:24.457 --> 00:29:29.901]  Now, that's in about 10 minutes after we come back from break.
[00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:40.230]  I'm gonna really focus and get into the huge ISIS news, the huge Syria news, the huge Malik reportedly passed background checks, her and her husband.
[00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.513]  Talk about a psycho lady, just wait till you see these photos.
[00:29:42.513 --> 00:29:46.116]  And huge saber-rattling between Russia and Turkey and more stay with us.
[00:29:48.951 --> 00:29:52.895]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.895 --> 00:29:55.559]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.453 --> 00:30:03.155]  Another GOP debate is upon us.
[00:30:03.155 --> 00:30:09.219]  A time to see how much attention will be allotted to establishment candidates who are dragging in the polls.
[00:30:09.219 --> 00:30:10.860]  These are Republican governors.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.422]  They don't give any credit to the free market.
[00:30:13.422 --> 00:30:15.943]  They don't give any credit to the entrepreneur.
[00:30:15.943 --> 00:30:17.705]  All is not lost, though.
[00:30:17.705 --> 00:30:19.866]  Some are speaking on real issues.
[00:30:19.866 --> 00:30:25.410]  But if you're not going to respond to the no-fly zone strategy, what would yours be?
[00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:28.772]  The first thing I would do is I wouldn't arm our enemies.
[00:30:28.772 --> 00:30:29.773]  I wouldn't arm ISIS.
[00:30:30.533 --> 00:30:31.554]  Yes.
[00:30:31.554 --> 00:30:34.858]  Will controversial statements impact some of the candidates?
[00:30:34.858 --> 00:30:48.572]  Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.

[00:31:59.031 --> 00:32:00.312]  I want more candy!
[00:32:00.312 --> 00:32:01.313]  I want more video games!
[00:32:01.313 --> 00:32:02.073]  Mine!
[00:32:02.073 --> 00:32:02.213]  Mine!
[00:32:02.213 --> 00:32:02.333]  Mine!
[00:32:28.871 --> 00:32:29.291]  I think so.

[00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:07.050]  Here it is, right here.
[00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:09.731]  I think the puppet on the right shares my beliefs.
[00:33:09.731 --> 00:33:13.953]  I think the puppet on the left is more to my liking.
[00:33:13.953 --> 00:33:15.053]  Hey, wait a minute.
[00:33:15.053 --> 00:33:16.934]  There's one guy holding up both puppets.
[00:33:16.934 --> 00:33:18.174]  Shut up!
[00:33:18.174 --> 00:33:19.595]  Go back to bed, America.
[00:33:19.595 --> 00:33:23.136]  Your government is in control.
[00:33:23.136 --> 00:33:28.037]  Defending the republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:33:28.037 --> 00:33:29.458]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.172 --> 00:33:37.315]  That was the great, late great, Bill Hicks, bringing us in to this segment.
[00:33:37.315 --> 00:33:40.476]  DrudgeReport.com, if you're a TV viewer, radio listeners, I'll narrate for you.
[00:33:40.476 --> 00:33:41.577]  Look at these headlines.
[00:33:41.577 --> 00:33:43.518]  Billionaire Blitz to Conquer the Universe.
[00:33:43.518 --> 00:33:45.178]  Manic Elon Musk.
[00:33:45.178 --> 00:33:48.860]  Let's Get to Mars Before the Earth Bloats.
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:49.620]  Look at this headline.
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:52.582]  Make Good Robots to Fight Evil Robots.
[00:33:52.582 --> 00:33:56.704]  Rapid Unexpected Advances Could Kill Off Humankind, Say Top Scientist.
[00:33:57.554 --> 00:33:58.815]  How long have you been hearing that here?
[00:33:58.815 --> 00:34:04.078]  Just common sense info they call conspiracy theory.
[00:34:04.078 --> 00:34:07.800]  So that's coming up today.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.021]  Let me just start here.
[00:34:10.021 --> 00:34:17.925]  For radio listeners, I'll narrate, but for TV viewers at InfoWars.com forward slash show, we have a free feed going, you can see this.
[00:34:17.925 --> 00:34:22.168]  Tashfeen Malik reportedly passed background checks.
[00:34:22.168 --> 00:34:23.949]  And if you look at every photo of her,
[00:34:26.505 --> 00:34:50.084]  She looks completely psychopathic, completely murderous, completely mentally ill, completely chip-on-the-shoulder arrogant, because folks from super-suppressed countries like Saudi Arabia, where she couldn't even walk around with her face out normally, and if she was caught outside her house or driving, she'd be imprisoned or executed.
[00:34:50.084 --> 00:34:53.327]  She can't, under Stockholm Syndrome, admit to herself that was wrong.
[00:34:54.924 --> 00:35:06.773]  So she shows up in California in the middle of porn land with a lot of decadence and things that are obviously bad and anti-human in many respects, another extreme, and they can't handle it.
[00:35:06.773 --> 00:35:12.658]  And they can't handle a Christian or a Jew, you know, talking about their religion in front of them.
[00:35:12.658 --> 00:35:20.764]  And you look at her, it's the chip on the shoulder, the social engineering, how they merge Islam and all its oppression with the left and class warfare.
[00:35:22.466 --> 00:35:29.951]  And the social envy of the women in the dresses and the sexy outfits and the cool cars and the money.
[00:35:29.951 --> 00:35:33.553]  And a normal liberal flips out if they can't have all that and just hates everybody.
[00:35:33.553 --> 00:35:47.763]  But you mix that, that's why radical socialists and social envy types merge with radical Islam because it's a hate prosperity movement who want to cut off their noses to spite their face and don't want to take the good that's in the West
[00:35:50.216 --> 00:35:53.318]  They want to just project the bad onto all of it.
[00:35:53.318 --> 00:36:12.387]  And remember, it's the very sick Hollywood groups that are pushing the sexualization of children, that are pushing the degradation of children, that are pushing the degradation of men as role models, who then push the leftist view, don't criticize Islam, don't criticize radical Islam, cover it up, call anybody a bigot who doesn't support it.
[00:36:12.387 --> 00:36:17.610]  And it is a form of sickening, decadent mental illness, leftist cuckolding,
[00:36:19.346 --> 00:36:20.946]  That they're engaged in.
[00:36:20.946 --> 00:36:28.568]  The Sumner Redstones, the Michael Moores that are into all this and who want to disarm the American people while they themselves have bodyguards.
[00:36:28.568 --> 00:36:43.011]  It's an act of climbing onto the dining table at a huge ball with a big bowl of punch, pulling their drawers down, leaning over the edge of it like it's a toilet and doing you know what.
[00:36:43.011 --> 00:36:44.611]  And that's who these people spiritually are.
[00:36:45.862 --> 00:36:47.043]  They're freaks.
[00:36:47.043 --> 00:36:48.665]  They're out of control.
[00:36:48.665 --> 00:36:50.386]  And it's an act of domination.
[00:36:50.386 --> 00:36:55.851]  They can bring in hundreds of thousands and millions in Europe of people who are absolutely incompatible.
[00:36:55.851 --> 00:37:01.336]  You know they're now violating orders all over Europe because the EU's ordered them not to do this.
[00:37:01.336 --> 00:37:04.319]  They said don't search their cell phones, don't search them, it violates their rights.
[00:37:04.319 --> 00:37:07.262]  When they're illegals, coming in, marching in by the thousands every day.
[00:37:08.263 --> 00:37:08.924]  Literally.
[00:37:08.924 --> 00:37:10.705]  Robbing, stealing, killing.
[00:37:10.705 --> 00:37:12.006]  And the police are just doing it.
[00:37:12.006 --> 00:37:20.193]  They're grabbing the cell phones, they're uploading it for the public to see, and it is them chopping people's heads off, raping women, murdering, burning churches.
[00:37:20.193 --> 00:37:21.795]  This is their trophies!
[00:37:21.795 --> 00:37:28.681]  Like the average western man wants to go hunt elk and put a trophy on the wall and talk about the story, or, you know, have a 12-pound bass on the wall.
[00:37:28.681 --> 00:37:33.365]  Maybe a 14-foot hammerhead on the wall, like my daddy used to have.
[00:37:33.365 --> 00:37:34.766]  So my mother got sick of it on the wall.
[00:37:39.138 --> 00:37:47.282]  Well now, no, you got a Christian, you got a Catholic priest, an Orthodox priest, that's like having a bull elephant on your wall.
[00:37:47.282 --> 00:37:53.745]  There's a new headline, Secret US Policy Blocks Agents From Looking At Social Media Via Applicants Formal.
[00:37:53.745 --> 00:38:01.528]  Official says, that's ABC News, I got a stack of this today, there's a stack of this every day.
[00:38:01.528 --> 00:38:03.449]  But in Europe, they can't look at their cell phones.
[00:38:06.104 --> 00:38:06.724]  But they're doing it.
[00:38:06.724 --> 00:38:10.226]  I have an article today and it goes through the videos.
[00:38:10.226 --> 00:38:12.267]  It's not just head chopping videos.
[00:38:12.267 --> 00:38:15.489]  It's them chopping heads off in first person.
[00:38:15.489 --> 00:38:18.250]  These are precious little goodies.
[00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:29.637]  What do you think happens when they've got upwards of 300,000 men that have invaded and taken over the areas after the ISIS and al-Nusra troops go through?
[00:38:29.637 --> 00:38:32.118]  They come in with their families and move into the houses.
[00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:37.982]  And posed by the swimming pools, and you know, posed by the dead dad in the back.
[00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:41.143]  And then hell, just go ahead and rape the daughters and sell them into sex slavery.
[00:38:41.143 --> 00:38:42.864]  Because, well, they're not the proper type of Muslims.
[00:38:42.864 --> 00:38:44.005]  They're not Sunnis.
[00:38:44.005 --> 00:38:45.025]  They're Shiites.
[00:38:45.025 --> 00:38:52.368]  So they deserve, as sewage water is what is quoted in Arabic, sewage water.
[00:38:52.368 --> 00:38:53.089]  But like the U.S.
[00:38:53.089 --> 00:38:55.810]  professor says, Christians and Jews are sewage water.
[00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:58.511]  You can rob them, you can kill them, it doesn't matter.
[00:38:58.511 --> 00:38:59.592]  Thank you for the taxpayer money.
[00:39:02.119 --> 00:39:07.503]  And it's the classic arrogance of a white supremacist or a black supremacist or a Mexican supremacist or whoever.
[00:39:07.503 --> 00:39:10.625]  Just to say, we are the supreme, you're all dirt.
[00:39:10.625 --> 00:39:16.368]  We can do what we want to do to you.
[00:39:16.368 --> 00:39:18.470]  So this is how this is all being operated.
[00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:20.131]  What do you think happens when you got them there?
[00:39:20.131 --> 00:39:22.832]  The Russians start kicking them out.
[00:39:22.832 --> 00:39:25.574]  The Syrians start kicking them out.
[00:39:25.574 --> 00:39:27.936]  Of the towns they've stolen, where do they go?
[00:39:29.039 --> 00:39:32.722]  They go into Turkey, open arms, and then they go into Europe.
[00:39:32.722 --> 00:39:52.496]  And so, 80 plus percent are military-age men, their passports are fake, almost 80 percent, and they're just there, and they even on their photos and in their Facebooks, pose with them from Jihad battle and advertise to women, hey, I'm tough, look, I'm in Germany now looking for a date, I just fought for two years in Syria, I am bad, I am awesome.
[00:39:53.919 --> 00:39:55.661]  And the police are ordered, let them in.
[00:39:55.661 --> 00:39:58.323]  This is how they're getting their ISIS fighters back in.
[00:39:58.323 --> 00:40:02.787]  Because a lot of them were Western and were allowed to recruit to be sent in by the West.
[00:40:02.787 --> 00:40:05.749]  The Pentagon is officially now on record.
[00:40:05.749 --> 00:40:12.775]  Not just General Clark, not just all these other generals.
[00:40:12.775 --> 00:40:15.738]  Now I've got a report today where the Pentagon is being very public about this.
[00:40:17.932 --> 00:40:19.413]  Oh, look, there's the Wall Street Journal.
[00:40:19.413 --> 00:40:22.295]  Turkey struggles to halt Islamic State jihadist highway.
[00:40:22.295 --> 00:40:28.420]  Of them going back and forth at the government checkpoint into Syria and back out into Turkey.
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.501]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:40:30.501 --> 00:40:34.384]  Oh, we can't stop the hundreds of oil tankers a day coming through back and forth.
[00:40:34.384 --> 00:40:40.969]  Oh, we can't stop the armored vehicles that they have at Turkish bases loading with weapons and giving them training.
[00:40:40.969 --> 00:40:42.490]  All on record!
[00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:44.071]  And then our media just acts dumb.
[00:40:44.071 --> 00:40:45.232]  Oh, gee!
[00:40:45.232 --> 00:40:46.293]  They, oh, oh!
[00:40:48.126 --> 00:40:49.787]  This is why the Pentagon is so upset.
[00:40:49.787 --> 00:40:52.189]  So, look at this woman.
[00:40:52.189 --> 00:40:53.970]  Chip on the shoulder.
[00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:57.772]  Angry.
[00:40:57.772 --> 00:41:00.854]  Should never be here.
[00:41:00.854 --> 00:41:04.836]  Unless she went through cult deprogramming for years.
[00:41:04.836 --> 00:41:07.338]  I mean, whacked out of her brain.
[00:41:07.338 --> 00:41:12.381]  The equivalent of spending a decade or her whole life in a Jim Jones cult.
[00:41:12.381 --> 00:41:13.542]  And she's gonna show you
[00:41:15.356 --> 00:41:20.777]  Notice how it was mainly, the women were really young, sexy girls at the office.
[00:41:20.777 --> 00:41:23.798]  Where are the Christians, where are the Jews, where are the hot girls?
[00:41:23.798 --> 00:41:26.098]  She's gonna show you who's dominant.
[00:41:26.098 --> 00:41:39.461]  She never got to curl her hair, never got to wear makeup, never got to wear high heels, never got to eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
[00:41:46.243 --> 00:41:51.124]  Kayan up there going, gay fish, gay fish.
[00:41:51.124 --> 00:41:53.325]  You think she can handle that?
[00:41:53.325 --> 00:41:55.085]  Fishbowl, fishbowl.
[00:41:55.085 --> 00:41:56.645]  You think she can handle all that humor?
[00:41:56.645 --> 00:41:59.046]  It's like a hallucination to her.
[00:41:59.046 --> 00:42:01.167]  Just a year out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:42:01.167 --> 00:42:02.987]  Back over there at Jihad camps.
[00:42:02.987 --> 00:42:06.388]  Running around in the desert.
[00:42:06.388 --> 00:42:08.728]  And then gets over here.
[00:42:08.728 --> 00:42:12.689]  And then the weirdos in Hollywood are like, bring more!
[00:42:12.689 --> 00:42:13.469]  Shut up racist!
[00:42:13.469 --> 00:42:14.530]  Shut up Donald Trump!
[00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:14.910]  More!
[00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:15.650]  We want more!
[00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:25.114]  Because out of all the jihads that are going to happen, they're going to take all our guns, all our freedoms, and get rid of all our free speech.
[00:42:25.114 --> 00:42:28.616]  Of the Muslims, Christians, Atheists, whoever you are, we're going to lose everything.
[00:42:30.148 --> 00:42:31.729]  That's the class of civilizations.
[00:42:31.729 --> 00:42:40.633]  And out of the class of civilizations that Albert Pike envisioned, that Dick Cheney wrote about in 2000, they will bring us total suppression of individual liberty and freedom.
[00:42:40.633 --> 00:42:42.433]  Is that really what the left wants?
[00:42:42.433 --> 00:42:47.015]  Well, you watch CNN or MSNBC, they get up there and say, absolutely.
[00:42:47.015 --> 00:42:48.296]  Melissa Harris Perry is back.
[00:42:48.296 --> 00:42:49.957]  Let's play a clip of that.
[00:42:49.957 --> 00:42:52.398]  She doesn't like Darth Vader because he's black.
[00:42:52.398 --> 00:42:53.958]  And he had to white until he becomes good.
[00:42:53.958 --> 00:42:57.200]  Well, that's because the Skywalkers are white.
[00:42:59.014 --> 00:43:04.561]  And it's because black projects power and is ominous and is strong.
[00:43:04.561 --> 00:43:10.988]  And historically... I mean, I got a black car, not because I'm like, I don't like black people.
[00:43:10.988 --> 00:43:12.710]  I got a black car because it looks good.
[00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:15.934]  Darth Vader wouldn't look good if he was pink, would he?
[00:43:15.934 --> 00:43:16.755]  Or if he was gray.
[00:43:16.755 --> 00:43:18.758]  He looks good because he's black.
[00:43:20.367 --> 00:43:22.609]  And he's got a black man's voice as it sounds good.
[00:43:22.609 --> 00:43:26.251]  I mean, this is just ridiculous, but this is how everything's racist.
[00:43:26.251 --> 00:43:29.994]  You know, if you say that Paul Ryan's a hard worker, that's putting down black slaves.
[00:43:29.994 --> 00:43:35.018]  She attaches racism to every symbol, every word, where she controls it.
[00:43:35.018 --> 00:43:36.499]  She is the ultimate control freak.
[00:43:36.499 --> 00:43:39.761]  We should reject this cult leader.
[00:43:39.761 --> 00:43:43.044]  Here she is, see, Darth Vader's racist now, folks, here it is.
[00:43:44.292 --> 00:43:49.500]  I know why I have feelings good bad and otherwise about Star Wars and I have a lot.
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.664]  I spent the whole day talking about it.
[00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.429]  Oh.
[00:43:55.429 --> 00:43:56.009]  You could?
[00:43:56.009 --> 00:44:12.674]  Yeah, like, the part where he was totally a black guy whose name basically was James Earl Jones, and while he was black, he was terrible and bad and awful and used to cut off white men's hands and didn't, you know, actually claim his son, but as soon as he claims his son and goes over to the good, he takes off his mask and he is white.
[00:44:12.674 --> 00:44:18.176]  Oh yes, I have many, many feelings about that, but I will try to put them over here.
[00:44:20.234 --> 00:44:21.574]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:44:21.574 --> 00:44:23.835]  No, he talks like that because he's talking through a respirator.
[00:44:23.835 --> 00:44:24.695]  That's what it's supposed to sound like.
[00:44:24.695 --> 00:44:26.196]  It's computerized.
[00:44:26.196 --> 00:44:30.337]  The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
[00:44:30.337 --> 00:44:32.438]  Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.
[00:44:32.438 --> 00:44:36.119]  You weren't on a mercy mission this time.
[00:44:36.119 --> 00:44:40.540]  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:41.941]  Would it be okay if I did the voice, Sweetie K?
[00:44:41.941 --> 00:44:44.962]  So it would be a black guy?
[00:44:44.962 --> 00:44:48.423]  It's a white guy that does that NFL, before he died, I guess, voice of God.
[00:44:54.124 --> 00:44:56.264]  You know, I was thinking about doing a voiceover professionally.
[00:44:56.264 --> 00:45:01.605]  Because I have had some offers to actually do NFL style voiceovers.
[00:45:01.605 --> 00:45:05.606]  Because they can't, most of those guys have died now, they can't really find anybody that can do those voices.
[00:45:05.606 --> 00:45:07.646]  And I can kind of perfect them.
[00:45:07.646 --> 00:45:09.887]  Maybe I should do some right now for you.
[00:45:09.887 --> 00:45:12.087]  It was a white guy that did the voiceover for Heavy Metal.
[00:45:12.087 --> 00:45:13.427]  He also did a lot of other commercials.
[00:45:13.427 --> 00:45:16.148]  Maybe you heard this one.
[00:45:16.148 --> 00:45:18.688]  When you speak well, you command respect.
[00:45:18.688 --> 00:45:20.109]  You move ahead faster.
[00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:21.389]  Try a verbal advantage now.
[00:45:22.805 --> 00:45:24.345]  Or he did this voice, I forget his name.
[00:45:24.345 --> 00:45:32.208]  It's, uh... My evil extends across all time, all galaxies, all dimensions.
[00:45:32.208 --> 00:45:33.768]  A green jewel.
[00:45:33.768 --> 00:45:36.609]  Look into me one more time.
[00:45:36.609 --> 00:45:39.970]  Kind of fun, isn't it?
[00:45:42.256 --> 00:45:43.837]  I did do some national voiceovers.
[00:45:43.837 --> 00:45:44.958]  My goodness.
[00:45:44.958 --> 00:45:51.282]  You know, I could make more money doing national voiceovers right now than I, than this whole place makes a year.
[00:45:51.282 --> 00:45:52.703]  Did you know that?
[00:45:52.703 --> 00:45:55.805]  I am just so blessed to have those talents and then I don't even use them.
[00:45:55.805 --> 00:45:57.766]  I don't even use a big powerful voice here on air.
[00:45:57.766 --> 00:46:01.168]  Like most talk shows have a fake voice they use the entire broadcast.
[00:46:01.168 --> 00:46:04.070]  They get right up on the mic the whole time and just go, glad everybody's here.
[00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:09.133]  All right, let's go ahead now and talk to Ethan or Mike or James or Anthony or other people.
[00:46:10.174 --> 00:46:11.355]  How you doing ladies out there?
[00:46:11.355 --> 00:46:21.141]  I'm going to play this song for you right now and then anybody who wants to send me any tweets or anything and wants to meet a little bit later tonight, I'm going to be off by 8 o'clock, alright?
[00:46:21.141 --> 00:46:22.942]  I'm not, I'm joking.
[00:46:22.942 --> 00:46:25.143]  Let me get serious here.
[00:46:25.143 --> 00:46:26.064]  I'm procrastinating.
[00:46:26.064 --> 00:46:30.507]  Let me get back to the serious news just briefly, then I'll go to your phone calls.
[00:46:30.507 --> 00:46:36.730]  So Tashif, or Tashfeen Malik, look she's wearing black headdress, that's because she's racist too.
[00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:38.612]  Reportedly passed background checks.
[00:46:42.586 --> 00:46:43.146]  Syrians!
[00:46:43.146 --> 00:46:44.227]  Let's go over here.
[00:46:44.227 --> 00:46:50.251]  Syrians arrested in Swiss terror plot were transporting toxic gas for Geneva attack.
[00:46:50.251 --> 00:46:51.272]  Well, what's wrong with that?
[00:46:51.272 --> 00:46:53.313]  I mean, it's their culture.
[00:46:53.313 --> 00:46:57.416]  Masked raider citing ISIS stabs teacher in the Paris in the throat.
[00:46:57.416 --> 00:47:00.698]  Critical condition.
[00:47:00.698 --> 00:47:01.479]  I love this image.
[00:47:01.479 --> 00:47:08.724]  Hundreds of refugees, actually thousands, caught with images of ISIS flags, severed heads on their iPhones.
[00:47:10.828 --> 00:47:12.149]  They had other devices.
[00:47:12.149 --> 00:47:13.970]  Well, but they had the police leading them into Europe.
[00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:14.830]  I mean, what's wrong with that?
[00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:15.731]  I mean, it can't be all bad.
[00:47:15.731 --> 00:47:17.552]  They have a new video.
[00:47:17.552 --> 00:47:19.933]  Muslim refugees left behind on the Autobahn.
[00:47:19.933 --> 00:47:21.174]  Giant piles of trash.
[00:47:21.174 --> 00:47:24.836]  We're going to cover that next hour.
[00:47:24.836 --> 00:47:29.779]  This is one of those top princes over in Saudi Arabia, the one that owns part of Fox News.
[00:47:29.779 --> 00:47:31.880]  Trump schools pompous Saudi prince.
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:33.721]  Has your country taken any of the Syrian refugees?
[00:47:35.011 --> 00:47:49.595]  Friday, Prince Alawid bin Taliwad Salim Baghdugulbab, I'm sorry, Alawid bin Talalala, slammed Donald Trump for proposing a ban on Muslim immigrants in the U.S.
[00:47:49.595 --> 00:47:54.117]  until the government could alleviate security concerns.
[00:47:54.117 --> 00:47:58.258]  Prince Alawid called Donald Trump a disgrace for his popular plan.
[00:48:01.038 --> 00:48:05.401]  You are not only a disgrace for GOP, but all of America.
[00:48:05.401 --> 00:48:06.401]  Withdraw from the U.S.
[00:48:06.401 --> 00:48:09.943]  presidential race, as you will never win.
[00:48:09.943 --> 00:48:11.204]  How about this?
[00:48:11.204 --> 00:48:12.085]  How about Trump goes back?
[00:48:12.972 --> 00:48:17.493]  Your country has sex slave dungeons and kills women for not wearing a hood on head.
[00:48:17.493 --> 00:48:18.373]  You are a disgrace!
[00:48:18.373 --> 00:48:19.314]  You shut up!
[00:48:19.314 --> 00:48:24.015]  See, we're being lectured by some of the most sickening degenerate criminals the galaxy has ever seen.
[00:48:24.015 --> 00:48:29.316]  I believe what Saudi Arabia does is criminal against humanity, crimes against humanity, Geneva Convention.
[00:48:29.316 --> 00:48:30.637]  That's my opinion.
[00:48:30.637 --> 00:48:33.237]  My opinion is it's a blue sky today in Austin as well.
[00:48:33.237 --> 00:48:35.138]  A Carilion sky, a beautiful sky.
[00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:38.771]  It's hard not to be on that right now.
[00:48:38.771 --> 00:48:41.471]  I feel the gravitational pull to Valhalla.
[00:48:41.471 --> 00:48:46.712]  ACLU leader resigns after threatening mass murder of Trump supporters.
[00:48:46.712 --> 00:48:48.633]  Top of the ACLU in Colorado.
[00:48:48.633 --> 00:48:50.773]  Talk about a bunch of freaks.
[00:48:50.773 --> 00:48:54.614]  I want a culture here that will put hoods over my wife's head and make my daughter slaves.
[00:48:54.614 --> 00:48:55.855]  How dare you, Donald Trump!
[00:48:55.855 --> 00:48:56.915]  Want to screen anybody?
[00:48:56.915 --> 00:48:57.555]  You filth!
[00:48:57.555 --> 00:48:58.675]  I can't believe it!
[00:48:58.675 --> 00:49:00.736]  And Darth Vader's black!
[00:49:00.736 --> 00:49:01.736]  These people are crazy!
[00:49:03.114 --> 00:49:05.295]  Trump says Clinton killed hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:49:05.295 --> 00:49:05.936]  That's true.
[00:49:05.936 --> 00:49:10.098]  Well, if she didn't, Syria and Libya are dead on target.
[00:49:10.098 --> 00:49:11.158]  Trump is.
[00:49:11.158 --> 00:49:11.759]  Continuing.
[00:49:11.759 --> 00:49:12.759]  CENTCOM investigation.
[00:49:12.759 --> 00:49:13.480]  War on Syria.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:14.420]  Non-Islamic State.
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:15.161]  You read this.
[00:49:15.161 --> 00:49:17.142]  The Pentagon is officially investigating.
[00:49:17.142 --> 00:49:19.003]  They have all these top people saying it's all fake.
[00:49:19.003 --> 00:49:19.843]  We run ISIS.
[00:49:19.843 --> 00:49:20.964]  It's all unraveling.
[00:49:20.964 --> 00:49:21.684]  Biggest thing ever.
[00:49:21.684 --> 00:49:22.705]  This is so huge.
[00:49:22.705 --> 00:49:24.706]  This continues to unravel.
[00:49:24.706 --> 00:49:25.526]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:49:25.526 --> 00:49:25.967]  Video.
[00:49:25.967 --> 00:49:29.749]  Kids scream, I want to kill him while beating Donald Trump pinata to stop hate.
[00:49:32.236 --> 00:49:33.536]  Get me a Donald Trump pinata.
[00:49:33.536 --> 00:49:34.237]  Have one made.
[00:49:34.237 --> 00:49:35.177]  I don't care what it costs.
[00:49:35.177 --> 00:49:36.637]  Rob Dew or the theater department.
[00:49:36.637 --> 00:49:38.398]  He's got a degree in theater.
[00:49:38.398 --> 00:49:39.899]  Can we just get me a Donald Trump thing?
[00:49:39.899 --> 00:49:41.859]  And I just want to talk about how horrible he is.
[00:49:41.859 --> 00:49:44.860]  And just go, how dare you want to cut taxes?
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:47.761]  How dare you want to screen people at the border?
[00:49:47.761 --> 00:49:48.962]  It's crazy.
[00:49:48.962 --> 00:49:53.163]  I'm going to flash up articles of how they're letting all the Al Qaeda people in.
[00:49:53.163 --> 00:49:54.963]  And then where's my article here?
[00:49:54.963 --> 00:49:58.345]  I've got an article here where it's all admitted.
[00:49:58.345 --> 00:49:59.225]  Where it's all admitted.
[00:50:00.305 --> 00:50:02.147]  That they're not even screening these people coming in.
[00:50:02.147 --> 00:50:02.727]  Yes, here it is.
[00:50:02.727 --> 00:50:04.028]  Reportedly passed background checks.
[00:50:04.028 --> 00:50:06.090]  Just let them in.
[00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:07.731]  Oh, you've been in a terror training camp?
[00:50:07.731 --> 00:50:10.193]  And you look like you want to kill everybody?
[00:50:10.193 --> 00:50:12.175]  And we won't give visas to anybody else but you.
[00:50:12.175 --> 00:50:18.680]  Oh, here you come on, sweetie.
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:27.487]  Briefly, I just want to remind everybody that we launch a special this time of year, every year, that only runs through the end of December, a little bit into January, usually.
[00:50:28.908 --> 00:50:29.568]  Half off.
[00:50:29.568 --> 00:50:30.629]  Six months off.
[00:50:30.629 --> 00:50:31.890]  Only in December do we offer this.
[00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:32.890]  This time of year.
[00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:33.611]  Six months off.
[00:50:33.611 --> 00:50:35.012]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:50:35.012 --> 00:50:36.593]  Twenty people can use these membership.
[00:50:36.593 --> 00:50:38.934]  There's normally $5.95 a month.
[00:50:38.934 --> 00:50:40.975]  That comes down to even less, like $3.
[00:50:40.975 --> 00:50:44.197]  So we already discount it when you buy it, you know, a year, like a couple months.
[00:50:44.197 --> 00:50:44.738]  So it comes down.
[00:50:44.738 --> 00:50:46.218]  Point is, it's a huge discount.
[00:50:46.218 --> 00:50:46.759]  It's massive.
[00:50:48.146 --> 00:50:51.311]  It's half off the regular price, InfoWars.
[00:50:51.311 --> 00:50:57.520]  Store.com has links over to PrisonPlanet.tv, but you go to PrisonPlanet.tv and it's 20 people to get.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.043]  Just buy one membership, give the membership code to them.
[00:51:03.528 --> 00:51:04.989]  A crashing economy.
[00:51:04.989 --> 00:51:06.109]  Are you ready?
[00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:08.871]  At best, your local stores have a three-day supply of food.
[00:51:08.871 --> 00:51:11.232]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?
[00:51:11.232 --> 00:51:15.013]  Are you willing to gamble your family's safety that it'll never happen to you?
[00:51:15.013 --> 00:51:20.095]  Be wise and be ready with 25-Year Shelf Life Wise Food Storage.

[00:51:51.993 --> 00:51:52.073]  800-803-5505.
[00:51:52.073 --> 00:51:52.113]  800-803-5505.
[00:51:57.436 --> 00:52:01.357]  Are you prepared to bug out?
[00:52:01.357 --> 00:52:09.179]  Infidel Body Armor and an Army Ranger have produced a high speed DVD and book to show you how to drive in combat, patrol, and how to survive in combat.

[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.041]  DrivenDVD.com.
[00:52:15.041 --> 00:52:19.322]  Advertising your business with GCN is simple, effective, and more affordable than
[00:52:19.602 --> 00:52:19.883]  I think.
[00:52:30.302 --> 00:52:31.103]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:52:31.103 --> 00:52:32.904]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:52:32.904 --> 00:52:34.545]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:52:34.545 --> 00:52:37.366]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:52:37.366 --> 00:52:39.668]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[00:52:39.668 --> 00:52:44.171]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[00:52:44.171 --> 00:52:48.113]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[00:52:52.336 --> 00:52:53.657]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[00:53:00.197 --> 00:53:03.360]  What looks good under your Christmas tree and tastes even better?
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:04.901]  Big Berkey Water Filters!
[00:53:04.901 --> 00:53:06.863]  Yes, the gift of clean water.
[00:53:06.863 --> 00:53:11.547]  A gift that provides a great foundation for achieving good health in the lives of your loved ones.
[00:53:11.547 --> 00:53:15.150]  A Big Berkey Water Filter gives them protection from bacteria, heavy metals,
[00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:19.192]  Chlorine, fluoride, pesticides and herbicides, VOCs and more.
[00:53:19.192 --> 00:53:24.776]  And best of all, a big Berkey water filter is a gift that lasts for many years with no additional investment.
[00:53:24.776 --> 00:53:28.838]  And that saves time and money in filter replacements that other water filters require.
[00:53:28.838 --> 00:53:33.861]  And are even powerful enough to purify treated, untreated or even stagnant pond water.
[00:53:34.241 --> 00:53:40.945]  As always, all orders over $50 are shipped free, and GCN listeners get 5% off all ceramic filter systems.

[00:53:47.909 --> 00:53:48.849]  Or call 877-99-BERKEY.
[00:53:48.849 --> 00:53:49.450]  That's 877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[00:53:49.450 --> 00:53:50.410]  Gift well this Christmas.
[00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:51.991]  Give a Big Berkey Water Filter!
[00:54:03.238 --> 00:54:09.724]  We are back live.
[00:54:09.724 --> 00:54:11.025]  Look at DrugsReport.com.
[00:54:11.025 --> 00:54:12.366]  Trump at 41%.
[00:54:12.366 --> 00:54:14.368]  Surging more in polls.
[00:54:14.368 --> 00:54:15.869]  We're going to cover that coming up.
[00:54:15.869 --> 00:54:17.811]  Oh, and magically, look what I just talked about earlier.
[00:54:17.811 --> 00:54:21.674]  It posted, Kurt Russell blasts gun control push.
[00:54:21.674 --> 00:54:23.476]  I think it's absolutely insane.
[00:54:24.963 --> 00:54:27.164]  And Hot Air's got that story.
[00:54:27.164 --> 00:54:29.005]  I think we wrote one back on Friday, too.
[00:54:29.005 --> 00:54:32.567]  We really need to talk about that because InfoWars does not have this right now.
[00:54:32.567 --> 00:54:35.589]  I'm going to just copy the Hot Air story over to InfoWars.
[00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:39.851]  We should also do a story about celebrities that are pro-gun and just let people know how many of them there are.
[00:54:40.896 --> 00:54:42.878]  And you're like, who cares what celebrities think?
[00:54:42.878 --> 00:54:44.319]  Well, that's what the public thinks.
[00:54:44.319 --> 00:54:45.400]  I guess we did do a story about it.
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:48.222]  Kurt Russell Schools reporter on gun control.
[00:54:48.222 --> 00:54:50.444]  So we did have one back on Friday.
[00:54:50.444 --> 00:54:51.145]  So boom!
[00:54:51.145 --> 00:54:52.606]  Good job, guys.
[00:54:52.606 --> 00:54:56.009]  Very, very exciting to see that going on.
[00:54:56.009 --> 00:55:01.554]  So let's repost both of them to the front of InfoWars because the average Joe out there does not know this is going on.
[00:55:02.844 --> 00:55:06.186]  I know we got Ethan, I know we got Mike, James, Anthony, Mike and others.
[00:55:06.186 --> 00:55:08.487]  We're going to start going to you into the next segment.
[00:55:08.487 --> 00:55:14.271]  I'm going to get our guests from the Britannic Isle on about 10 minutes into the next hour.
[00:55:14.271 --> 00:55:17.632]  They'll be with us for the rest of the hour, but I will continue with your calls until then.
[00:55:17.632 --> 00:55:20.714]  But they'll be with us a little bit in the next hour after that as well.
[00:55:20.714 --> 00:55:26.998]  The founder of the English Defense League, which has been arrested for trying to protest radical Islam.
[00:55:28.134 --> 00:55:29.515]  Put in prison.
[00:55:29.515 --> 00:55:32.476]  And he got out of it when it became racist.
[00:55:32.476 --> 00:55:35.698]  He's attacked by the white supremacist and the radical islamicist.
[00:55:35.698 --> 00:55:41.981]  So that gentleman will be joining us coming up with Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[00:55:41.981 --> 00:55:45.263]  Tommy Robinson will be joining us.
[00:55:45.263 --> 00:55:48.705]  Obama is speaking right now on ISIS.
[00:55:48.705 --> 00:55:54.148]  And it's a big deal because we have, as I just mentioned, the Department of Defense coming out.
[00:55:54.148 --> 00:55:55.749]  I'm going to cover that in the third hour today.
[00:55:57.461 --> 00:56:01.423]  Saying, we run ISIS, Turkey runs ISIS, it's horrible, we gotta stop.
[00:56:01.423 --> 00:56:04.164]  There's now an official Inspector General investigation.
[00:56:04.164 --> 00:56:11.146]  So this is way beyond Whitewater or Watergate or little petty stuff compared to this.
[00:56:11.146 --> 00:56:12.407]  This is a big deal.
[00:56:12.407 --> 00:56:14.787]  And the House of Cards is coming down.
[00:56:14.787 --> 00:56:16.928]  But Obama says no strategy changes expected.
[00:56:16.928 --> 00:56:21.050]  No, just fake bombing and bombing military bases with the Russians.
[00:56:21.891 --> 00:56:24.675]  They're in Syria blowing up their missiles.
[00:56:24.675 --> 00:56:27.200]  There'll be lots of that in the fight against ISIS.
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:31.467]  They'll be bombing and with artillery out of Turkey attacking the Russians and the Syrians.
[00:56:31.467 --> 00:56:31.848]  So there you go.
[00:56:33.422 --> 00:56:34.783]  But did I mention Obama's black?
[00:56:34.783 --> 00:56:35.664]  So it's okay.
[00:56:35.664 --> 00:56:39.567]  Oh, by the way, Melissa Harris-Perry doesn't like me, obviously, because I criticize her.
[00:56:39.567 --> 00:56:40.708]  She criticizes me.
[00:56:40.708 --> 00:56:42.590]  But I always attack her on her policies and what she does.
[00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:47.754]  I'm going to be under the belt today, and I'm going to attack her for what she looks like with her makeup off.
[00:56:47.754 --> 00:56:55.640]  I just want to tell her that I personally think it's wrong for her to put on so much makeup that it becomes a mask.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:57:01.625]  Do we have the image, guys, of Melissa Harris-Perry with makeup, and you remove the makeup, and, well,
[00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:11.655]  I just want to say that if there was an alien force taking over the planet, they would try to get humans to fight with each other over skin color as a divide-and-conquer strategy.
[00:57:11.655 --> 00:57:13.476]  But it's actually not aliens from deep space.
[00:57:13.476 --> 00:57:16.377]  It's the British great game of divide-and-conquer balkanization.
[00:57:16.377 --> 00:57:20.759]  So, thank you, Melissa Harris Perry, whatever planet you really come from.
[00:57:20.759 --> 00:57:29.364]  Now, before I end this hour, because I barely plugged for 15 seconds last hour, I'm going to come back and take your phone calls, obviously, in the next segment.
[00:57:30.726 --> 00:57:33.046]  Six months free, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:33.046 --> 00:57:37.647]  That's the nightly news, that's all my films, books, videos, other folks' films.
[00:57:37.647 --> 00:57:41.688]  It's really high quality, works great, has super fast streaming, downloading.
[00:57:41.688 --> 00:57:44.008]  This way, when we get sent to other places, we have this.
[00:57:44.008 --> 00:57:45.889]  Can download it, give it to friends and family.
[00:57:45.889 --> 00:57:47.809]  It's normally $5.95 a month.
[00:57:47.809 --> 00:57:50.610]  If you buy a year right now, it's half price.
[00:57:50.610 --> 00:57:53.230]  We only offer this at the end of the year, every year.
[00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:54.670]  The special is now running.
[00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:55.390]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:55.850]  $36 a year.
[00:57:58.951 --> 00:58:01.952]  Instead of $54.95, you say, well, how's that half off?
[00:58:01.952 --> 00:58:03.913]  A year is always discounted a couple months.
[00:58:03.913 --> 00:58:05.293]  This is discounted six.
[00:58:05.293 --> 00:58:06.994]  So the normal discounted price is $54.
[00:58:06.994 --> 00:58:09.994]  It's now $36 right now.
[00:58:09.994 --> 00:58:14.996]  And 20 people can use the username simultaneously.
[00:58:14.996 --> 00:58:17.917]  So you can give 20 people the gift and tell them, hey, don't share this passcode.
[00:58:19.062 --> 00:58:21.463]  But they can, because nobody uses it all at the same time.
[00:58:21.463 --> 00:58:22.703]  I hope that you get locked out.

[01:00:15.001 --> 01:00:16.802]  We are on the march.
[01:00:16.802 --> 01:00:19.944]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:00:19.944 --> 01:00:24.307]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:24.307 --> 01:00:25.087]  I'm gonna go in order.
[01:00:25.087 --> 01:00:28.509]  Ethan, Mike, James, Anthony, Mike, and others and our guests will be on with us.
[01:00:28.509 --> 01:00:30.270]  Ethan in Oklahoma, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:34.213]  Worldwide, Ted Cruz surging ahead in at least one state against Trump.
[01:00:34.213 --> 01:00:37.835]  Trump's gaining a lead in other areas, but they're now shedding the two against each other.
[01:00:37.835 --> 01:00:43.178]  Tomorrow night's debate we'll have live coverage of at PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:00:43.178 --> 01:00:44.299]  Ethan, what do you think's going on here?
[01:00:45.732 --> 01:01:00.634]  I think that the Republican National Committee is, they realize that they can't tell Trump what to do so they're pushing Cruz so they want Cruz because they can tell him what to do because he can still be bought and Trump cannot.
[01:01:02.619 --> 01:01:06.781]  Well, there's some talk about where he was born, too, to try to disqualify him.
[01:01:06.781 --> 01:01:09.582]  I don't see there's proof that Cruz can be bought.
[01:01:09.582 --> 01:01:13.524]  But at the same time, I just don't know him like I know Rand Paul.
[01:01:13.524 --> 01:01:15.505]  I mean, I would rather have a Rand Paul or a Donald Trump.
[01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:16.405]  People ask, who do I support?
[01:01:16.405 --> 01:01:18.946]  I take a Rand Paul or a Donald Trump.
[01:01:18.946 --> 01:01:24.088]  The problem is Rand Paul has not been aggressive enough with the advisors he's got.
[01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:28.509]  You know, Trump, I think, is the guy now.
[01:01:28.509 --> 01:01:31.990]  And I wish those two would make friends and, you know, maybe Rand Paul be vice president or something.
[01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:35.912]  Because he'd make a good vice president, but I don't see him stepping down.
[01:01:35.912 --> 01:01:42.295]  And I wish he wouldn't have attacked Trump so much, because I know the two behind the scenes have played golf a few times and were supposedly friends.
[01:01:42.295 --> 01:01:45.296]  So it's all pretty disgusting.
[01:01:45.296 --> 01:01:45.916]  I hear you, Ethan.
[01:01:45.916 --> 01:01:47.297]  I appreciate your call.
[01:01:47.297 --> 01:01:49.237]  Let's go to Anthony in Florida.
[01:01:49.237 --> 01:01:50.958]  Anthony in Florida, you're on air.
[01:01:50.958 --> 01:01:51.338]  Go ahead.
[01:01:51.338 --> 01:01:53.819]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:01:53.819 --> 01:01:54.259]  Good, my friend.
[01:01:54.259 --> 01:01:54.640]  What do you think?
[01:01:56.377 --> 01:02:01.662]  Okay, basically what I think, I think it's funny that Ted Cruz is surging.
[01:02:01.662 --> 01:02:02.783]  It smells fishy to me.
[01:02:02.783 --> 01:02:04.464]  I don't know much about him.
[01:02:04.464 --> 01:02:17.055]  But my more statement I want to make on is the fact that Donald Trump, these people against him are publicly being allowed to threaten his life and there's no action.
[01:02:17.055 --> 01:02:18.596]  They're not being prosecuted, arrested.
[01:02:18.596 --> 01:02:21.759]  That's right, there are Democrats and others saying kill him and it's okay.
[01:02:23.129 --> 01:02:31.534]  If you remember, when Obama was running for a second term, a man made a statement, oh, if Obama gets elected president, I'm gonna kill him.
[01:02:31.534 --> 01:02:33.355]  They were at his doorstep and arrested him.
[01:02:35.401 --> 01:02:42.266]  Listen, I've had people say pretty mild stuff on our comment board and the Secret Service shows up here.
[01:02:42.266 --> 01:02:42.907]  And that's fine.
[01:02:42.907 --> 01:02:48.351]  One time I had a guy send me a letter saying he was going to kill George W. Bush and all how he was planning to do it and everything else.
[01:02:48.351 --> 01:02:49.792]  I called the Secret Service.
[01:02:49.792 --> 01:02:51.233]  They came over, got the letter.
[01:02:51.233 --> 01:02:55.256]  They arrested the guy in a house with all these weapons, planning to kill Bush.
[01:02:55.256 --> 01:02:58.138]  And even though I didn't like Bush, I don't want any harm to come on him.
[01:02:58.138 --> 01:02:58.879]  So, you know, I hear you.
[01:02:58.879 --> 01:03:00.200]  They usually respond to this stuff.
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.020]  They've not been responding.
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:03.162]  That's a good sign that how much they hate Trump.
[01:03:04.606 --> 01:03:10.108]  There's been a big thing about taking our guns.
[01:03:10.108 --> 01:03:14.910]  And I think it goes back to the Militia Act of 1972.
[01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:21.493]  Because we all know the Second Amendment, but the Militia Act were a pair of statutes enacted by the Second United States Congress in 1792.
[01:03:23.354 --> 01:03:23.574]  Yeah, hi.
[01:03:23.574 --> 01:03:25.215]  Yeah, my concern is it's really hard because
[01:03:53.646 --> 01:03:56.347]  No, I was hoping that Rand would be able to talk now.
[01:03:56.347 --> 01:03:57.748]  Yeah, talk right into your telephone.
[01:03:57.748 --> 01:03:59.648]  Talk right into your telephone.
[01:03:59.648 --> 01:04:01.089]  Yeah, okay.
[01:04:01.089 --> 01:04:02.089]  Can you hear me better?
[01:04:02.089 --> 01:04:03.850]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:12.233]  Okay, my concern is that Ted could be a perfect mentor in Canada, but I don't have any feel for what's behind him.
[01:04:12.233 --> 01:04:17.675]  I'm hoping that Rand would break through to get his Trump on.
[01:04:17.675 --> 01:04:19.516]  I agree that it could be Donald Trump.
[01:04:19.516 --> 01:04:21.697]  Well, Rand Paul will have to put his big boy pants on to do that.
[01:04:23.195 --> 01:04:26.676]  I agree, and I get the question that's really on my heart.
[01:04:26.676 --> 01:04:33.037]  It should be the best chance candidate for the constitutional administration of the President of the United States.
[01:04:33.037 --> 01:04:34.178]  I caught most of what you said.
[01:04:34.178 --> 01:04:35.218]  The phone's pretty bad.
[01:04:35.218 --> 01:04:41.580]  Look, we know that Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Donald Trump are all better than Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Jeb Bush.
[01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:42.880]  I'll take any one of them.
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:44.802]  I'll take any one of them.
[01:04:44.802 --> 01:04:47.105]  I mean, obviously you can't always trust these people.
[01:04:47.105 --> 01:04:50.811]  We've been betrayed too much, but I'll take any one of them.
[01:04:50.811 --> 01:04:53.995]  Okay, I like Trump the best now because he's a hard charger.
[01:04:53.995 --> 01:04:57.500]  He puts on big boy pants every morning, not the little short shorts.
[01:04:59.969 --> 01:05:03.993]  Despite all the status rhetoric that gun control works, here's five reasons why it won't.
[01:05:03.993 --> 01:05:11.480]  Number one, California has many of the most restrictive gun laws in the country, yet those laws did absolutely nothing to stop the San Bernardino shooting.
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:18.386]  Number two, Paris, France also has some of the most restrictive gun laws in the world, but those laws also did nothing to stop the November 13th ISIS attacks.
[01:05:18.726 --> 01:05:25.330]  Number three, it's estimated that someone in Chicago is shot every 2.8 hours despite the city's strict gun laws.
[01:05:25.330 --> 01:05:32.815]  Number four, Mexico also has restrictive gun laws just like Chicago, yet over 160,000 people have been murdered in the country's drug war since 2007.
[01:05:33.996 --> 01:05:47.159]  The only people who are actually stopping the Mexican cartels are private citizens who are openly defying Mexico's gun laws to form self-defense militias.
[01:05:47.159 --> 01:05:56.100]  In fact, Obama approved the rearming of the so-called moderate rebels on October 1st, the same day he called for gun control in response to the community college shooting up in Oregon.

[01:07:52.671 --> 01:07:54.312]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:50.351]  Our guests are joining us in the next hour, Paul Watson and Tommy Robinson.
[01:08:50.351 --> 01:09:03.382]  Coming up later in this hour, I'm going to play an excerpt of a piece from the Nightly News last week where Rob Dew and Richard Reeves talk about how the system plans to shoot down Donald Trump politically.
[01:09:03.382 --> 01:09:09.747]  The American Dream wrote a story similar to it today that kind of dovetails with the piece we put out last week.
[01:09:10.819 --> 01:09:14.220]  How the Republican establishment can keep Donald Trump from getting the nomination.
[01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:25.284]  We probably need to add our video that had the headline, how Democrats have infiltrated the Republican Party and plan to steal the nomination from Donald Trump is our headline.
[01:09:25.284 --> 01:09:35.508]  We should probably add a link at least to this new story today to the video that goes over the situation because I say it's Democrats, that's basically what they are.
[01:09:37.622 --> 01:09:46.153]  But we're going to be getting to that report as well today, and Paul Watson will be hosting the fourth hour as well.
[01:09:46.153 --> 01:09:50.900]  I want to go back to your phone calls, but first...
[01:09:52.779 --> 01:09:55.720]  Russia warns Turkey over a Aegean warship incident.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.420]  We're going to be getting to that.
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:01.661]  Syrian rebels fire barrage of mortars into the Syrian capital and civilian areas.
[01:10:01.661 --> 01:10:04.581]  That's because they're little al-Qaeda heroes, according to our government.
[01:10:04.581 --> 01:10:05.341]  China.
[01:10:05.341 --> 01:10:09.602]  Navy carries out more drills in the disputed South China Sea.
[01:10:09.602 --> 01:10:12.282]  That's just some of the news on that front.
[01:10:12.282 --> 01:10:16.483]  Masked raider citing ISIS stabs teacher in the throat.
[01:10:16.483 --> 01:10:21.924]  ISIS coming into Europe, caught in Switzerland with thousands of gallons of gas to murder people.
[01:10:24.246 --> 01:10:27.231]  And a lot more coming up today.
[01:10:27.231 --> 01:10:28.793]  But right now we're taking phone calls.
[01:10:28.793 --> 01:10:29.535]  First-time callers 800-259-9231.
[01:10:29.535 --> 01:10:29.575]  800-259-9231.
[01:10:38.274 --> 01:10:41.875]  is the toll-free number to join us here on air.
[01:10:41.875 --> 01:10:44.676]  What do you think about Ted Cruz, Donald Trump?
[01:10:44.676 --> 01:10:53.619]  We've got Donald Trump going ahead in many polls around Iowa but not in other areas of the country.
[01:10:53.619 --> 01:10:55.260]  We have him surging there.
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:59.301]  Trump is ahead in many polls around the country only gaining his lead.
[01:11:00.572 --> 01:11:04.775]  Politico is reporting Trump hits a new high in national poll.
[01:11:04.775 --> 01:11:12.681]  The billionaire businessman surges to 41% after releasing proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the U.S., which is popular even with two-thirds of Democrats.
[01:11:12.681 --> 01:11:17.204]  Donald Trump got a little more of a vault in his ceiling nationwide.
[01:11:17.204 --> 01:11:22.728]  The polling-obsessed Manhattan multi-billionaire, leading Republican presidential candidate, broke into the 40s on Monday.
[01:11:22.728 --> 01:11:26.230]  According to the results of the latest university poll,
[01:11:27.251 --> 01:11:33.873]  And that's the issue, is that Cruz is not doing well, except in Iowa, but the media is making a huge deal out of this, really to push him to the head.
[01:11:52.403 --> 01:11:55.064]  So what do you think about Ted Cruz?
[01:11:55.064 --> 01:11:57.324]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Texas.
[01:11:57.324 --> 01:11:58.304]  Mike, thanks for calling.
[01:11:58.304 --> 01:11:58.844]  You're on the air.
[01:11:58.844 --> 01:12:02.445]  Hello?
[01:12:02.445 --> 01:12:03.425]  Yep, you're on the air.
[01:12:03.425 --> 01:12:04.605]  Welcome to the Airwaves.
[01:12:04.605 --> 01:12:05.846]  Hey, thank you.
[01:12:05.846 --> 01:12:08.206]  Honored to speak with you.
[01:12:08.206 --> 01:12:15.328]  Alex, I wanted to thank you and Dr. Ron Paul and the late, great Aaron Russo for waking me up.
[01:12:15.328 --> 01:12:21.629]  And my thoughts on Ted Cruz are, how can you trust a man like Ted Cruz when he places
[01:12:23.623 --> 01:12:44.240]  Well, I think clearly he's playing politics, trying to be nice to those old kingmakers, either to get elected and try to save the country, or he's one of them.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:48.003]  He's one of them, personally, and I liked him until I read that.
[01:12:48.696 --> 01:12:56.527]  I have one concern about Donald Trump where I recently read or saw that he was going to reauthorize the Patriot Act.
[01:13:00.993 --> 01:13:11.416]  I know that he is a big law and order type guy, and that's my big concern with him is talking about censoring the internet, talking about draconian police state measures to quote, keep us safe.
[01:13:11.416 --> 01:13:15.617]  They don't even use the NSA and the Patriot Act to stop these radicals coming in.
[01:13:15.617 --> 01:13:16.957]  They know they're radical.
[01:13:16.957 --> 01:13:17.817]  They let them in.
[01:13:17.817 --> 01:13:19.218]  If the government would just do its job.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.083]  And not let people in from radical countries with radical backgrounds.
[01:13:23.083 --> 01:13:24.444]  This wouldn't be happening.
[01:13:24.444 --> 01:13:26.866]  And again, the terror is not even that big a threat.
[01:13:26.866 --> 01:13:29.109]  But they're going to use it to take our liberties.
[01:13:29.109 --> 01:13:30.590]  So that it has to be exposed.
[01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:32.151]  It has to be stopped.
[01:13:32.151 --> 01:13:35.995]  And we also have to expose the fact that they're using the terror to take our freedoms.
[01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:36.876]  Yes.
[01:13:36.876 --> 01:13:38.437]  Those are the problems I have with Donald Trump.
[01:13:39.258 --> 01:13:45.381]  The next time he's on, or the next time one of my reporters talks to him on the campaign trail, we're going to bring up some of those issues.
[01:13:45.381 --> 01:13:51.023]  But I've talked to a lot of his advisors and other people and they say that obviously he's not going to censor the general public's internet.
[01:13:51.023 --> 01:13:57.946]  He means in those countries where ISIS is operating, so they can't spread their videos, their material of snuff films.
[01:13:57.946 --> 01:13:59.607]  And I don't think these Al Qaeda...
[01:14:00.407 --> 01:14:05.511]  ISIS videos where they have ten-year-old kids blowing people's heads off, graphically in HD.
[01:14:05.511 --> 01:14:06.812]  That should not be on the internet.
[01:14:06.812 --> 01:14:11.275]  That is a snuff film of a murder.
[01:14:11.275 --> 01:14:17.180]  Now, they don't censor that, but they'll censor if I show an Apache helicopter blowing up a Reuters van.
[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:25.726]  Well, that shouldn't be censored because it's not a deliberate snuff film and you don't see people up close dying, you know, with blood coming out of their eyes.
[01:14:25.726 --> 01:14:27.387]  It's just absolutely out of control.
[01:14:28.351 --> 01:14:29.571]  So I hear what you're saying.
[01:14:29.571 --> 01:14:33.092]  Any other concerns, Mike?
[01:14:33.092 --> 01:14:36.613]  No, I just say peace, not war, love, not hate.
[01:14:36.613 --> 01:14:37.413]  God bless you.
[01:14:37.413 --> 01:14:38.693]  Appreciate you calling today.
[01:14:38.693 --> 01:14:40.713]  We're going to go to James in a moment from California.
[01:14:40.713 --> 01:14:43.454]  I just want to say this.
[01:14:43.454 --> 01:14:53.156]  I don't believe in lesser of two evils, but if someone is a maverick and someone wants to defend the Second Amendment, defend our sovereignty, not have the ban on coal power plants,
[01:14:54.198 --> 01:14:57.219]  Cut our taxes on industry where jobs come back here.
[01:14:57.219 --> 01:15:01.721]  Get rid of the loopholes where foreign corporations can go overseas and not pay taxes.
[01:15:01.721 --> 01:15:06.422]  Everything he is doing is basically like cutting ropes on a hot air balloon.
[01:15:06.422 --> 01:15:08.723]  You cut those ropes, the balloon will rise.
[01:15:08.723 --> 01:15:12.224]  Or it's like a boat at a dock, tied up to the dock.
[01:15:12.224 --> 01:15:23.388]  And the boat might be strong enough to pull the dock away and drag it through the lake, but at a certain point it's going to sink under and your boat's going to be basically tied up and won't be able to travel anymore until you cut the rope of the chain.
[01:15:24.637 --> 01:15:27.378]  And we know Hillary's evil.
[01:15:27.378 --> 01:15:29.639]  We know Bernie Sanders is super evil.
[01:15:29.639 --> 01:15:32.960]  We know Jeb Bush is a total fraud and super bad news.
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:37.642]  And so I will not support a general election, Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush.
[01:15:37.642 --> 01:15:46.706]  And I would support, at that time, a third party run for Donald Trump, even if he lost, just because he would educate people it's the right thing to do and I'm not going to the lesser of two evils.
[01:15:47.486 --> 01:15:52.129]  In fact, if Jeb Bush would make conservatives go to sleep, he'd finish the whole globalist agenda.
[01:15:52.129 --> 01:16:00.015]  Hillary getting in after eight years of Obama, no matter what she tried, she'd be scandal-ridden, she'd be impeached, she'd be destroyed.
[01:16:00.015 --> 01:16:06.219]  Now, I don't want that to happen because I believe justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[01:16:06.219 --> 01:16:08.881]  That's what I believe in.
[01:16:08.881 --> 01:16:11.183]  And so, do the right thing, no matter what.
[01:16:14.775 --> 01:16:16.516]  Go for the best candidate.
[01:16:16.516 --> 01:16:18.957]  Well, some of them aren't obviously perfect.
[01:16:18.957 --> 01:16:20.237]  I don't completely trust Ted Cruz.
[01:16:20.237 --> 01:16:27.500]  Rand Paul has just been too milquetoast, and I know he's a good guy for real, and a patriot.
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.721]  I don't completely trust Donald Trump.
[01:16:29.721 --> 01:16:33.063]  Not that I think he's even a bad guy, he's just a wild man.
[01:16:33.063 --> 01:16:34.803]  All better than Hillary Clinton.
[01:16:34.803 --> 01:16:36.144]  All better than Jeb Bush.
[01:16:36.144 --> 01:16:37.544]  All better than Bernie Sanders.
[01:16:37.544 --> 01:16:40.766]  I mean, I know these are bad people.
[01:16:40.766 --> 01:16:41.426]  I know them well.
[01:16:43.228 --> 01:16:46.630]  And so, there is no lesser of two evils here.
[01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:56.856]  It's a clear choice that those three Republicans, hands down, I mean, Huckabee's not even perfect, he's better than Hillary.
[01:16:56.856 --> 01:17:01.979]  Because they don't have a fundamental wish to destroy this country and enslave us.
[01:17:01.979 --> 01:17:10.705]  They like the status quo pretty much, the good old boy system, which isn't perfect, but, you know, they don't want to get rid of all of America's jobs and do deals with China so we have nothing.
[01:17:11.618 --> 01:17:17.284]  I mean, the globalists want to bring this country down for world government.
[01:17:17.284 --> 01:17:30.497]  And it's one thing if Cruz gives lip service to globalists, which he does, or if Donald Trump does, because if you don't at least go sit with these dragons, Bush Sr., people like that, they will send people after you.
[01:17:33.683 --> 01:17:44.873]  So, I mean, is Ted Cruz patronizing when he says, honored to share a few moments with Dr. Kissinger and hear his thoughts on the challenges facing our nation?
[01:17:44.873 --> 01:17:48.596]  Is that petting the dragon's belly?
[01:17:48.596 --> 01:17:54.041]  I would meet with Henry Kissinger, and I would say globalism has not stabilized the world.
[01:17:54.041 --> 01:18:00.567]  It is a form of conquest, and your greatest crime is dumbing people down, and that's why I reject your entire system.
[01:18:02.079 --> 01:18:12.803]  Do you want to repent of it and try to come out with any regrets you have near the end of your life with a way to make globalism be more altruistic and try to reverse what it's done before it destroys the world?
[01:18:12.803 --> 01:18:16.525]  Do you want to be more like Joseph Stiklitz or Jimmy Carter?
[01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:20.266]  Who aren't perfect, but compared to Henry Kissinger, they're angel cakes.
[01:18:20.266 --> 01:18:21.987]  He is a war criminal.
[01:18:21.987 --> 01:18:24.308]  James in California, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:18:24.308 --> 01:18:26.869]  Hi.
[01:18:26.869 --> 01:18:27.369]  You there?
[01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:27.629]  Yes, sir.
[01:18:29.165 --> 01:18:31.568]  Hi, so I'm going to start off with Isaiah 4516.
[01:18:31.568 --> 01:18:33.771]  They shall be ashamed and also confounded, all of them.
[01:18:33.771 --> 01:18:37.595]  They shall go into confusion together that are makers of idols.
[01:18:37.595 --> 01:18:41.340]  Alex Jones, do not make Ted Cruz or Donald Trump into an idol.
[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:43.102]  You will be confused by them.
[01:18:43.102 --> 01:18:46.927]  I see Donald Trump as being a cast stunt in COINTELPOP operation on you.
[01:18:47.427 --> 01:18:51.590]  I think that what he has put there to do is bring in the police state, just like Ted Cruz.
[01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:53.632]  They're both to bring in the police state.
[01:18:53.632 --> 01:18:55.593]  Neither one of them will stop the police state.
[01:18:55.593 --> 01:18:57.035]  They will not stop the police state.
[01:18:57.035 --> 01:18:59.537]  They will not stop the version of the police state.
[01:18:59.537 --> 01:19:03.059]  So we can't look to them to be our idols in this sense.
[01:19:03.059 --> 01:19:07.022]  We will just be confused when the stuff goes down.
[01:19:07.022 --> 01:19:08.544]  Let him go.
[01:19:08.544 --> 01:19:10.085]  Delete that.
[01:19:10.085 --> 01:19:15.349]  Listen, guys, everybody cusses on purpose and you think it's cute and I delay you out and you're not on the show anymore.
[01:19:17.366 --> 01:19:18.547]  I understand you're high and mighty.
[01:19:18.547 --> 01:19:19.727]  I understand you're lecturing us.
[01:19:19.727 --> 01:19:23.049]  I understand you've got the power of God behind you and you're reading verses at us.
[01:19:23.049 --> 01:19:23.469]  I get it.
[01:19:23.469 --> 01:19:24.209]  Just don't cuss at us.
[01:19:24.209 --> 01:19:24.709]  We can't have that.
[01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:30.812]  We're on the FCC, AM and FM stations across the country and cable and some UHF stations already.
[01:19:30.812 --> 01:19:34.694]  Next year I'll start the big push to get us on TV all over the country.
[01:19:34.694 --> 01:19:35.394]  I'm so sick of it.
[01:19:39.571 --> 01:19:43.073]  I'm not saying Ted Cruz or Rand Paul or Donald Trump are my idols.
[01:19:43.073 --> 01:19:44.554]  I don't worship them.
[01:19:44.554 --> 01:19:45.914]  And they're also not idols.
[01:19:45.914 --> 01:19:53.518]  They're not inanimate objects like a golden calf or some other Egyptian creature.
[01:19:53.518 --> 01:19:54.879]  They're men.
[01:19:54.879 --> 01:19:56.560]  And we're talking about who's going to lead this country.
[01:20:00.228 --> 01:20:03.350]  Still wondering what to get that special someone that has everything?
[01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:13.496]  At ID Stronghold, we still find that a huge percentage of people do not yet have an RFID blocking wallet or purse to protect them from the new and growing threat of electronic pickpocketing.
[01:20:13.496 --> 01:20:26.825]  That's right, even though 40% of all new chipped payment cards shipped in 2014 contain a wireless interface called RFID that allows the account information to be skimmed by a thief passing near your cards, most people are still unprotected.
[01:20:27.205 --> 01:20:32.948]  The good news is that ID Stronghold makes luxurious leather wallets and other products that prevent this.
[01:20:32.948 --> 01:20:41.913]  ID Stronghold founded the entire RFID protection industry and has been protecting the RFID chips in government and military ID cards for over a decade.
[01:20:41.913 --> 01:20:47.857]  So go to idstronghold.com and get that loved one a stylish leather RFID blocking wallet or clutch.
[01:20:47.857 --> 01:20:49.578]  That's idstronghold.com.
[01:20:49.898 --> 01:20:52.724]  After all, wallets and purses have always been a great gift.
[01:20:52.724 --> 01:20:54.968]  Now, they are an even better gift!

[01:22:00.575 --> 01:22:07.278]  Chronic inflammation is now known to block your ability to repair and compromises your immune system, making you more vulnerable to all diseases.
[01:22:07.278 --> 01:22:12.460]  Since poor diet, injuries, or stress are all contributing factors, many people suffer from inflammation.
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:17.602]  Your body's number one means of neutralizing inflammation and the pain that it may be causing is glutathione.
[01:22:17.602 --> 01:22:22.164]  Glutathione is the body's number one peptide to neutralize free radicals and thus stop inflammation.
[01:22:22.164 --> 01:22:23.825]  Hi, my name is Jason.
[01:22:23.825 --> 01:22:24.325]  I'm 44 years old.
[01:22:24.505 --> 01:22:30.872]  For ten years, I had been suffering from chronic pain in my abdomen and groin that radiated down into my feet.
[01:22:30.872 --> 01:22:38.201]  After three weeks on One World Way, the pain in my feet reduced by 50% and the overall pain in my body reduced significantly as well.
[01:22:38.201 --> 01:22:39.242]  I ran out of One World Way

[01:24:23.401 --> 01:24:25.222]  ...couple million a year.
[01:24:25.222 --> 01:24:27.424]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[01:24:27.424 --> 01:24:29.506]  Right out of war-torn areas.
[01:24:29.506 --> 01:24:31.107]  Combat vets.
[01:24:31.107 --> 01:24:33.009]  I sat down with Big Brother.
[01:24:33.009 --> 01:24:34.670]  They're crazy, whacked-out women.
[01:24:34.670 --> 01:24:36.291]  Don't like those RFIDs.
[01:24:36.291 --> 01:24:39.274]  Well, dump them with hoods over their heads by the thousands in your neighborhood.
[01:24:41.129 --> 01:24:44.890]  And if you don't like it, they'll just come over and shoot you a couple times.
[01:24:44.890 --> 01:24:50.353]  And if you don't like that, we'll just call you racist.
[01:24:50.353 --> 01:24:54.395]  And if you say the sky's blue, we'll just call you racist.
[01:24:54.395 --> 01:25:03.120]  Or if you say we gotta shut down all the people coming in until we at least vet them to make Congress act, you just go, oh, Donald Trump says no Muslims ever.
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:06.962]  Oh, you don't let Christians in for thousands that they let in.
[01:25:06.962 --> 01:25:08.483]  There won't be one or two Christians.
[01:25:10.489 --> 01:25:12.450]  That's because they're not part of the club.
[01:25:12.450 --> 01:25:21.294]  I mean, you don't think our government launched an attack in Syria to kill 200,000 Christians so far because they love them, do you?
[01:25:21.294 --> 01:25:23.835]  Or to kill all the Christians in Libya.
[01:25:23.835 --> 01:25:24.995]  The black Christians and others.
[01:25:24.995 --> 01:25:26.756]  I mean, that's the whole plan.
[01:25:26.756 --> 01:25:28.296]  To persecute Christians worldwide.
[01:25:28.296 --> 01:25:34.059]  Look at the persecution of Christians now in this country.
[01:25:34.059 --> 01:25:36.900]  That's the whole game plan.
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:38.781]  And the persecution of the family and everything else.
[01:25:40.953 --> 01:25:44.638]  I'm going to cover news in the next segment and continue with calls, but right now let's go back to your calls.
[01:25:44.638 --> 01:25:46.100]  Duke in Oklahoma.
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:54.191]  What do you think about Ted Cruz rising in the Iowa polls, surging ahead of Donald Trump, Trump gaining leads in national polls?
[01:25:55.954 --> 01:26:07.820]  Well, I like his sternness, and that's what I think we need, is somebody with a little bit of sternness right now that actually can fight for exactly what they say.
[01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:10.221]  And I think Ted Cruz is very strong.
[01:26:10.221 --> 01:26:16.944]  I've always listened to his voice and how he talks about it, what he wants to do, and he's strong about it.
[01:26:16.944 --> 01:26:19.765]  He is the most presidential of all of them, hands down.
[01:26:19.765 --> 01:26:21.426]  He's the slickest, the best.
[01:26:21.426 --> 01:26:22.967]  He's the most statesmanlike, yes.
[01:26:24.153 --> 01:26:25.454]  Absolutely.
[01:26:25.454 --> 01:26:29.015]  You know, Rand Paul, I prayed Rand Paul would come out strong.
[01:26:29.015 --> 01:26:31.716]  I prayed he would fight with his words.
[01:26:31.716 --> 01:26:33.457]  He just never did it.
[01:26:33.457 --> 01:26:35.398]  And maybe he still will.
[01:26:35.398 --> 01:26:38.119]  He hasn't done it thus far.
[01:26:38.119 --> 01:26:42.681]  It's really hard to believe, because I know he can be more fiery than this.
[01:26:42.681 --> 01:26:43.982]  More fiery than his father, too.
[01:26:45.396 --> 01:26:47.897]  I mean, his dad would be fighting harder than this right now.
[01:26:47.897 --> 01:26:49.818]  He just, I mean, I'm just calling it like it is.
[01:26:49.818 --> 01:26:52.740]  It's like I'm a fan of a football team and then they fall on their face.
[01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.641]  You gotta say, whoa, they blow it.
[01:26:54.641 --> 01:26:55.741]  And he's blowing it, man.
[01:26:55.741 --> 01:27:03.085]  He's got a bunch of advisors that I have to know are just dumber than a box of rocks.
[01:27:03.085 --> 01:27:05.607]  Uh, you know, we've got Donald Trump.
[01:27:05.607 --> 01:27:07.888]  Uh, yeah, I like some of the stuff he says.
[01:27:07.888 --> 01:27:11.870]  He seems like a man that will do some things that we need.
[01:27:12.708 --> 01:27:15.552]  But do I see him sticking up for the little guys?
[01:27:15.552 --> 01:27:18.415]  Well, I've seen him, you know, kick a few little guys down.
[01:27:18.415 --> 01:27:20.317]  I still like the guy.
[01:27:20.317 --> 01:27:23.922]  I just don't know if he's going to give us exactly what we need.
[01:27:23.922 --> 01:27:27.786]  Are we going to be right back to square one whenever he becomes president?
[01:27:27.786 --> 01:27:28.207]  You tell me.
[01:27:29.312 --> 01:27:46.679]  Well, I think we will be back to square one if the President doesn't know how to deal with Congress, and if the people don't know how to deal with Congress, and pressure them with recalls, you name it, to actually vet the spending bills, to actually exert lawmaking power over the courts and over the executive.
[01:27:46.679 --> 01:27:56.863]  Congress is the most broke-leg, crooked-leg creation it's ever been, and it's advocated, it's handed over its authority.
[01:27:57.722 --> 01:28:05.488]  And that's why we're in so much turmoil, is because they have engaged in that abdication.
[01:28:05.488 --> 01:28:08.311]  They have turned over their rightful authority.
[01:28:08.311 --> 01:28:12.774]  I mean, the Federal Reserve gets up on TV and says, Congress cannot even touch us or make laws.
[01:28:12.774 --> 01:28:13.435]  We're above them.
[01:28:13.435 --> 01:28:14.616]  We're the fourth branch of government.
[01:28:14.616 --> 01:28:16.677]  And then it's private, and that's a total fraud.
[01:28:16.677 --> 01:28:18.939]  Congress controls the issuance of currency and credit.
[01:28:18.939 --> 01:28:21.081]  And then Congress wanted to stand up and say, how dare you?
[01:28:21.081 --> 01:28:22.382]  We're going to audit you.
[01:28:22.382 --> 01:28:24.143]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:28:24.143 --> 01:28:24.604]  What do you think?
[01:28:27.085 --> 01:28:30.809]  Well, you know, I think this is the most important election in our history.
[01:28:30.809 --> 01:28:35.533]  And I think the election after this election will be the most important election in history.
[01:28:35.533 --> 01:28:42.980]  I think the next two elections will be the deciding factor of what really happens and what things become in this country.
[01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:43.601]  I agree.
[01:28:43.601 --> 01:28:44.341]  Well, not just here.
[01:28:44.341 --> 01:28:46.284]  Worldwide, the globalists are on the march.
[01:28:46.284 --> 01:28:48.627]  The ringwraiths worldwide are riding.
[01:28:48.627 --> 01:28:49.768]  They are taking countries down.
[01:28:49.768 --> 01:28:50.989]  They're installing tyranny.
[01:28:50.989 --> 01:28:52.311]  They're gutting cultures.
[01:28:52.311 --> 01:28:54.794]  They're bankrupting societies for social control.
[01:28:54.794 --> 01:28:56.576]  The world is going into bondage.
[01:28:56.576 --> 01:28:59.159]  The world is going into darkness.
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:04.402]  Uh, and that in every culture, darkness is, you know, the symbol of evil falling.
[01:29:04.402 --> 01:29:06.603]  Melissa Harris Perry says, don't use that word, it's racist.
[01:29:06.603 --> 01:29:07.383]  No, it's not.
[01:29:07.383 --> 01:29:10.685]  In Africa, they call, you know, the devil the dark one or whatever.
[01:29:10.685 --> 01:29:14.046]  Even in non-Christian cultures, it doesn't have to do with if you have black skin or white skin.
[01:29:14.046 --> 01:29:16.928]  It means the devil sneaks around in the dark.
[01:29:16.928 --> 01:29:19.769]  And, you know, the Nazis wore black uniforms.
[01:29:19.769 --> 01:29:21.550]  It's to project evil.
[01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:23.411]  It's to project dominance.
[01:29:23.411 --> 01:29:25.532]  And it's to project the idea of death.
[01:29:25.532 --> 01:29:28.073]  That's why the executioner wears black in every culture.
[01:29:29.679 --> 01:29:31.500]  All right, my friend, I appreciate your call.
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:32.420]  Good points.
[01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:34.020]  That was Duke.
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:34.821]  Let me return.
[01:29:34.821 --> 01:29:36.021]  I'm going to cover a ton of news.
[01:29:36.021 --> 01:29:41.443]  Some of it I've already mentioned, but I'm going to get into it deeper.
[01:29:41.443 --> 01:29:42.183]  And then Chris.
[01:29:42.183 --> 01:29:44.224]  JR, Dave, Adam, and others.
[01:29:44.224 --> 01:29:44.764]  800-259-9231.
[01:29:44.764 --> 01:29:45.544]  First-time callers.
[01:29:45.544 --> 01:29:47.145]  You're listening to InfoWars.
[01:29:47.145 --> 01:29:49.366]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:49.366 --> 01:29:50.766]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.766 --> 01:29:53.287]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.287 --> 01:29:55.968]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.336 --> 01:30:03.018]  Another GOP debate is upon us.
[01:30:03.018 --> 01:30:09.102]  A time to see how much attention will be allotted to establishment candidates who are dragging in the polls.
[01:30:09.102 --> 01:30:10.903]  These are Republican governors.
[01:30:10.903 --> 01:30:13.285]  They don't give any credit to the free market.
[01:30:13.285 --> 01:30:15.826]  They don't give any credit to the entrepreneur.
[01:30:15.826 --> 01:30:17.588]  All is not lost though.
[01:30:17.588 --> 01:30:19.729]  Some are speaking on real issues.
[01:30:19.729 --> 01:30:25.273]  But if you're not going to respond in a no-fly zone strategy, what would yours be?
[01:30:25.273 --> 01:30:28.655]  The first thing I would do is I wouldn't arm our enemies.
[01:30:28.655 --> 01:30:29.636]  I wouldn't arm ISIS.
[01:30:30.396 --> 01:30:31.416]  Yes.
[01:30:31.416 --> 01:30:34.737]  Will controversial statements impact some of the candidates?
[01:30:34.737 --> 01:30:49.261]  Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.

[01:31:00.864 --> 01:31:02.545]  Oil of oregano formulation.
[01:31:02.545 --> 01:31:08.148]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[01:31:08.148 --> 01:31:16.512]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[01:31:16.512 --> 01:31:22.616]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[01:31:22.616 --> 01:31:24.997]  Extracted directly from the wild herb.
[01:31:25.597 --> 01:31:26.818]  We're good to go.
[01:31:50.072 --> 01:31:52.555]  Now available at Infowarslife.com.

[01:31:56.881 --> 01:32:02.267]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:32:02.267 --> 01:32:07.073]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:32:07.173 --> 01:32:07.574]  We're good.
[01:32:28.641 --> 01:32:29.741]  BrainForce is here.
[01:32:29.741 --> 01:32:31.962]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:32:31.962 --> 01:32:36.963]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:32:36.963 --> 01:32:38.643]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[01:32:38.643 --> 01:32:40.144]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:32:40.144 --> 01:32:43.725]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:32:43.725 --> 01:32:45.705]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:32:45.705 --> 01:32:46.625]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[01:32:46.625 --> 01:32:47.826]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:32:47.826 --> 01:32:49.806]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:32:49.806 --> 01:32:55.407]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:13.553 --> 01:33:20.115]  You are a programmable guy that goes and watches Olympus is Falling, and believes all this, and really thinks you're a hero!
[01:33:20.115 --> 01:33:20.775]  G.I.
[01:33:20.775 --> 01:33:23.075]  Joe, Great American Hero!
[01:33:23.075 --> 01:33:23.516]  Joe!
[01:33:23.516 --> 01:33:24.256]  Joe!
[01:33:24.256 --> 01:33:25.696]  You don't work for Joe!
[01:33:25.696 --> 01:33:27.737]  Joe got taken over!
[01:33:27.737 --> 01:33:28.317]  The G.I.
[01:33:28.317 --> 01:33:31.698]  Joe command base is run by Cobra!
[01:33:31.698 --> 01:33:32.898]  You understand that?
[01:33:32.898 --> 01:33:38.079]  And I use a child analogy to get through to you, because that's your main programming template in North America.
[01:33:38.079 --> 01:33:39.460]  They're on record with that!
[01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:40.920]  That was all Pentagon directed!
[01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:43.361]  You understand you work for Cobra.
[01:33:43.361 --> 01:33:44.822]  You dress like Cobra.
[01:33:44.822 --> 01:33:46.502]  You have the tactics of Cobra.
[01:33:46.502 --> 01:33:47.783]  You are Cobra.
[01:33:47.783 --> 01:33:49.704]  Hail Cobra!
[01:33:49.704 --> 01:33:50.764]  You want to be little boys?
[01:33:50.764 --> 01:33:53.705]  Or do you want to really join the Republic?
[01:33:53.705 --> 01:33:58.828]  They know what's going on at the Bundy Ranch, and they won't even let a police information officer give us any information.
[01:33:58.828 --> 01:34:00.048]  That's a bunch of bull****.
[01:34:00.048 --> 01:34:01.469]  It's all these stupid G.I.
[01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:04.330]  Joe movies and stuff, where the White House is attacked.
[01:34:04.330 --> 01:34:06.051]  The White House is run by Cobra!
[01:34:06.571 --> 01:34:14.660]  When I went through the process of becoming Press Secretary, one of the first things they told me was, you're not even to acknowledge the drone program.
[01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:17.604]  You're not even to discuss that it exists.
[01:34:17.604 --> 01:34:19.245]  It's run by chaos.
[01:34:19.245 --> 01:34:21.128]  It's run by Spectre.
[01:34:21.128 --> 01:34:25.693]  Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, Extortion.
[01:34:26.571 --> 01:34:27.613]  They run little kids.
[01:34:27.613 --> 01:34:28.854]  They run the snuff films.
[01:34:28.854 --> 01:34:29.655]  They run the drugs.
[01:34:29.655 --> 01:34:30.376]  They run it all.
[01:34:30.376 --> 01:34:35.403]  And because you act like a bunch of naive chumps, this whole thing's gonna come down on us!
[01:34:35.403 --> 01:34:41.131]  Very much concerns me, considering that they have all this bulk ammunition that they're shooting targets of children.
[01:34:41.651 --> 01:34:44.293]  Would you like to tell me who it is that is doing this?
[01:34:44.293 --> 01:34:46.834]  It is the Department of Homeland Security, sir.
[01:34:46.834 --> 01:34:48.815]  Oh, thank you for calling.
[01:34:48.815 --> 01:34:54.938]  To every police officer in this country, to every FBI agent, to every Secret Service agent, you work for Spectre.
[01:34:54.938 --> 01:34:56.259]  You work for Chaos.
[01:34:56.259 --> 01:35:01.322]  You work for Cobra.
[01:35:01.322 --> 01:35:02.322]  How do they get power?
[01:35:02.322 --> 01:35:06.765]  They stage a terror attack using Spectre, using Cobra.
[01:35:11.092 --> 01:35:12.333]  Go f*** yourself.
[01:35:12.333 --> 01:35:13.094]  Who is COBRA?
[01:35:13.094 --> 01:35:16.918]  Arms dealing, drug dealing, money laundering group, wearing masks.
[01:35:16.918 --> 01:35:21.463]  They wear masks, ladies and gentlemen, because they're the corporate CEOs.
[01:35:21.463 --> 01:35:24.226]  And they're manipulating the governments against each other.
[01:35:24.226 --> 01:35:25.788]  COBRA runs the Muslims.
[01:35:25.788 --> 01:35:27.610]  COBRA runs the CIA.
[01:35:27.610 --> 01:35:29.011]  COBRA runs it all.
[01:35:29.011 --> 01:35:30.473]  COBRA is real.
[01:35:30.473 --> 01:35:31.995]  You can call it whatever you want.
[01:35:33.286 --> 01:35:35.388]  Cobra is in control of America.
[01:35:35.388 --> 01:35:41.394]  And Cobra says the veterans and the gun owners, they're saying that we're the bad guys.
[01:35:41.394 --> 01:35:46.760]  These people who hold themselves down to be patriots are not.
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:49.262]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[01:35:49.262 --> 01:35:50.904]  That's what Cobra would say.
[01:35:50.904 --> 01:35:52.646]  That's what Specter would say.
[01:35:52.646 --> 01:35:54.408]  That's what Goldfinger would say.
[01:35:54.408 --> 01:35:56.410]  Because that's who those people are.
[01:35:57.131 --> 01:36:01.377]  I am Supreme Cobra Commander!
[01:36:01.377 --> 01:36:06.766]  You call your petty bureaucrats officials and authorities?
[01:36:06.766 --> 01:36:11.052]  You will kneel before Cobra of faith!
[01:36:13.229 --> 01:36:17.311]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:36:17.311 --> 01:36:19.832]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:36:19.832 --> 01:36:22.873]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Cobra Leader.
[01:36:22.873 --> 01:36:25.173]  You pathetic little worm!
[01:36:25.173 --> 01:36:27.814]  How dare you call me Mr. Cobra!
[01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:37.237]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[01:36:37.237 --> 01:36:39.321]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:36:39.321 --> 01:36:42.066]  Coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[01:36:42.066 --> 01:36:43.529]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:36:44.961 --> 01:36:51.464]  On this 14th day of December 2015, Monday edition, the nightly news is coming up tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[01:36:51.464 --> 01:36:55.546]  Paul Joseph Watson will be quarterbacking the fourth hour.
[01:36:55.546 --> 01:37:03.490]  He'll also be co-hosting the third hour today on the immigration invasion in Europe, the internal politics, the way it's being used to restrict people's free speech.
[01:37:03.490 --> 01:37:04.411]  We have a gentleman joining us.
[01:37:05.071 --> 01:37:11.652]  who founded the British Defense League and became a very fast-growing party that got infiltrated by racists and taken over.
[01:37:11.652 --> 01:37:16.834]  He got out of it, so he has the white supremacists and the radical Muslims after him.
[01:37:16.834 --> 01:37:19.054]  Tommy Robinson will be joining us.
[01:37:19.054 --> 01:37:27.376]  Enemy of the State is the new DVD and book, and it deals with the fact that he gets arrested basically going out anywhere giving a speech.
[01:37:27.376 --> 01:37:28.116]  He's not allowed to talk.
[01:37:29.691 --> 01:37:31.912]  That's how incredible the leftist censorship is.
[01:37:31.912 --> 01:37:35.193]  So whether you agree with him or disagree or agree with part of it, look at Le Pen.
[01:37:35.193 --> 01:37:37.715]  She's like milquetoast Rand Paul.
[01:37:37.715 --> 01:37:40.676]  I don't mean that meanly, but she's well-spoken, nice, friendly.
[01:37:40.676 --> 01:37:45.698]  There is a radical Muslim invasion and it threatens our sovereignty to the greatest extent since World War II.
[01:37:45.698 --> 01:37:46.138]  Boom!
[01:37:46.138 --> 01:37:48.079]  Arrested!
[01:37:48.079 --> 01:37:51.421]  They said you will not compare Islam to Nazism.
[01:37:51.421 --> 01:37:54.022]  Even though most of Islam joined with the Nazis in World War II.
[01:37:55.919 --> 01:37:57.479]  I mean, it's just a fact.
[01:37:57.479 --> 01:38:02.320]  And again, I don't have Islamophobia, folks, for about 30-40% of Islam.
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:03.841]  I've studied it deeply.
[01:38:03.841 --> 01:38:07.481]  Islam's had periods where it was more enlightened than Christendom.
[01:38:07.481 --> 01:38:09.102]  I mean, you can look that up.
[01:38:09.102 --> 01:38:13.622]  Christendom's been just as bad, just as crazy, just as evil in some respects.
[01:38:13.622 --> 01:38:14.803]  But it wasn't really Christianity.
[01:38:14.803 --> 01:38:15.903]  Well, I'll say, fine.
[01:38:15.903 --> 01:38:17.163]  You want to say Islam isn't this?
[01:38:17.163 --> 01:38:19.684]  Fine!
[01:38:19.684 --> 01:38:21.224]  Wahhabism is dominating
[01:38:22.915 --> 01:38:23.456]  We're good to go.
[01:38:41.004 --> 01:38:45.929]  And you see the West joined with the most aggressive, militaristic, dominant form of Islam.
[01:38:45.929 --> 01:38:54.857]  In a civil war, worldwide, to bring down other Islamic groups and clear out Christians, part of the deal they've signed with Saudi Arabia.
[01:38:54.857 --> 01:39:01.463]  It is a policy to murder every Christian Saudi Arabia finds on record and
[01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:06.151]  You can go there if you're an oil company exec or whatever.
[01:39:06.151 --> 01:39:08.113]  You just stay in your western sector.
[01:39:08.113 --> 01:39:09.354]  You do not go out.
[01:39:09.354 --> 01:39:11.816]  Your wife does not show her face if she lives there.
[01:39:11.816 --> 01:39:13.838]  And you do not get caught with alcohol.
[01:39:13.838 --> 01:39:17.161]  And you do not get anything or you will be put in prison or executed.
[01:39:20.011 --> 01:39:37.500]  You go out on the street corner and preach about Jesus Christ, they will beat the living snot out of you on the spot, take you to jail, torture the daylights out of you until you confess, and then they'll roll you in front of a tribunal of clerics, and they will put you in jail for years if you're lucky.
[01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:42.803]  If you don't have special interests behind you, you will spend life in slave labor in one of their prisons.
[01:39:46.994 --> 01:39:50.019]  And we're just supposed to just, just, oh, we love this culture.
[01:39:50.019 --> 01:39:55.468]  This is a evil culture.
[01:39:55.468 --> 01:39:58.152]  Evil.
[01:39:58.152 --> 01:39:59.635]  The Nazis were an evil culture.
[01:39:59.635 --> 01:40:01.298]  The Aztecs became an evil culture.
[01:40:02.503 --> 01:40:05.126]  The tribes before them had very limited human sacrifice.
[01:40:05.126 --> 01:40:06.507]  They've dug into the ground.
[01:40:06.507 --> 01:40:08.810]  It was done on select times of the year.
[01:40:08.810 --> 01:40:12.233]  It was whacked out like other cultures all over the world did the same thing basically.
[01:40:12.233 --> 01:40:16.018]  They'd mainly kill nobility, royalty, stuff like that as offerings.
[01:40:16.018 --> 01:40:19.802]  Then it became kill the neighboring tribes and the Aztecs basically depopulated
[01:40:21.752 --> 01:40:24.314]  What is Mexico today in Guatemala?
[01:40:24.314 --> 01:40:34.760]  They would go as far as a thousand miles away into Central America down into South America to get slaves to bring back and kill because they had killed millions of people.
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:36.601]  Over 400, 500 year reign they had.
[01:40:36.601 --> 01:40:41.304]  They had run out of people so they would go capture entire cultures.
[01:40:41.304 --> 01:40:49.549]  Tens of thousands and haul them back as slaves to kill them and eat them.
[01:40:49.549 --> 01:40:51.190]  Kill them and eat them.
[01:40:52.571 --> 01:41:03.999]  That's the priest class, and I've had Mayan archaeologists with degrees take me on the special tours when I was a kid and last year.
[01:41:03.999 --> 01:41:06.880]  And these are Mayans telling you what went on.
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:07.941]  It's a fact, folks.
[01:41:07.941 --> 01:41:20.169]  The media, you also get a politically correct one, like if you see a white tour guide, I'm not kidding, they'll go, it's not true, there were sacrifices, the Aztecs were loving, and you'll be like, that woman's crazy, you're gonna come with me, and just go over the whole deal.
[01:41:20.169 --> 01:41:21.110]  It's a fact.
[01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:29.233]  That whenever the conquistadors, just a couple hundred of them showed up, they could conquer Mexico City that was hundreds of thousands of people.
[01:41:29.233 --> 01:41:29.793]  And you know why?
[01:41:29.793 --> 01:41:34.634]  They had executed basically almost everybody.
[01:41:34.634 --> 01:41:35.915]  They had killed almost everybody.
[01:41:38.168 --> 01:41:40.469]  I mean, it was just, it was just crazy town.
[01:41:40.469 --> 01:41:43.270]  The Conquistadors showed up and just was like, what the?
[01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:59.896]  They had, down below each temple where they do sacrifice, they have a open-air market with all these pillars that had a roof, and they would hang people from those, and that was the main priest-class money, was selling meat to the middle class.
[01:41:59.896 --> 01:42:01.157]  And the meat was people.
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:12.543]  Directly out of Fulso Dooms Cave and Conan the Barbarian, but not a fiction movie.
[01:42:12.543 --> 01:42:14.843]  And it was that whacked out.
[01:42:14.843 --> 01:42:24.606]  People were on so many hallucinogens, so whacked out of their brains, that they just basically surrendered to the conquistadors.
[01:42:24.606 --> 01:42:31.168]  When I say an evil culture, radical Islam is basically, as far as I'm concerned, a satanic religion.
[01:42:32.588 --> 01:42:35.309]  I mean, if you want to talk about satanic tenants, it's it.
[01:42:35.309 --> 01:42:38.750]  I mean, look at this woman's face in her eyes.
[01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:46.293]  Tashfeen Malik in every photo looks like a completely whacked out psychopath who hates everybody around her.
[01:42:46.293 --> 01:42:51.735]  And under her Stockholm Syndrome, she really believed everybody were these infidels that deserve to die.
[01:42:51.735 --> 01:43:00.238]  Every photo, the same satisfied look that she's on a power trip, that she's got it right, that she knows everything.
[01:43:02.864 --> 01:43:06.909]  That she is the master.
[01:43:06.909 --> 01:43:11.334]  That she is allowed to do whatever she wants.
[01:43:11.334 --> 01:43:13.036]  Where have we heard of that before?
[01:43:13.036 --> 01:43:16.219]  That everybody else is an outcast.
[01:43:16.219 --> 01:43:18.322]  Everybody else is an infidel.
[01:43:18.322 --> 01:43:20.544]  Infidel defilers.
[01:43:20.544 --> 01:43:23.568]  They'll all drown in lakes of blood.
[01:43:26.753 --> 01:43:30.416]  Let me move into some other stories, sorry, then I'll go to your calls.
[01:43:30.416 --> 01:43:35.940]  Syrians arrested in Swiss terror plot were transporting toxic gas for Geneva attack.
[01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:46.167]  Gateway Pundit, Swiss authorities, that's out of France 24, their biggest TV station, reporting, Swiss authorities said Saturday that two people of Syrian origin have been arrested on suspicion of transporting explosives and toxic gases.
[01:43:47.110 --> 01:43:49.031]  The men were alleged to be armed and dangerous.
[01:43:49.031 --> 01:43:54.034]  Four terror suspects pictured flashing ISIS signs were given, sought in Geneva.
[01:43:54.034 --> 01:43:55.875]  Two of the suspects were arrested Friday.
[01:43:55.875 --> 01:44:01.578]  The men were transporting explosives and toxic gas for an alleged terror attack plan.
[01:44:01.578 --> 01:44:03.179]  And they reportedly had guns.
[01:44:03.179 --> 01:44:06.221]  Oh, in a country where only the citizens could have guns, they had them illegally.
[01:44:06.221 --> 01:44:11.604]  How magical is that?
[01:44:11.604 --> 01:44:15.266]  Mask Raider citing ISIS stabs teacher in Paris
[01:44:17.443 --> 01:44:23.364]  A teacher has been attacked at a nursery school in Paris by a hooded, knife-wielding man claiming links to ISIS state.
[01:44:23.364 --> 01:44:34.927]  The 45-year-old male victim was alone in his classroom in the kindergarten in the northern suburb of Aubervillers when the armed assailant burst in around 7.30 local time.
[01:44:34.927 --> 01:44:41.928]  According to the prosecutor, prior to the attack, the man used another name for Islamic State, told the victim, this is death.
[01:44:41.928 --> 01:44:42.888]  It's a warning.
[01:44:42.888 --> 01:44:45.409]  The teacher is reported to have been stabbed in the side of the throat.
[01:44:52.571 --> 01:44:55.733]  This story is up on DrugsReport.com.
[01:44:55.733 --> 01:44:58.474]  In fact, let's just punch that up for folks.
[01:44:58.474 --> 01:45:05.478]  It's on the right-hand side, and we'll just click on that, and I can show people.
[01:45:05.478 --> 01:45:15.943]  Hundreds of refugees caught with images of ISIS flags severed heads on their phones.
[01:45:15.943 --> 01:45:16.944]  Well, it's the culture.
[01:45:16.944 --> 01:45:19.225]  I mean, why not let them cut you or your daughters out off, or son?
[01:45:22.025 --> 01:45:26.788]  Police raise alarm about asylum seekers entering Norway.
[01:45:26.788 --> 01:45:37.755]  Authorities have discovered images of ISIS flags and shevered heads on the cell phones of hundreds of asylum seekers crossing into Norway.
[01:45:37.755 --> 01:45:41.077]  Into Europe.
[01:45:41.077 --> 01:45:45.379]  Highlighting concerns about terrorists exploiting the migrant crisis to infiltrate jihadists into Europe.
[01:45:45.379 --> 01:45:46.060]  We know that's happened.
[01:45:52.332 --> 01:46:02.000]  The news in Europe is reporting an explosion of refugees crossing the country in recent months meant the police immigration service, PU, had to register the migrants quickly.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:16.671]  According to the report, after searching luggage and mobile phones belonging to migrants, notice that Switzerland's they're telling you what's on their phones or else they won't, police have logged hundreds of examples of photos and videos of executions and brutal punishments, such as images of people holding up severed heads and hands.
[01:46:16.671 --> 01:46:21.535]  Authorities also discovered numerous examples of ISIS flags and symbols belonging to other terrorist organizations.
[01:46:24.102 --> 01:46:37.037]  Eric Hoogland, head of Norway's asylum program, said that the images may be on the phones for innocent reasons, but that some individuals have likely downloaded the photos because they supported or were affiliated with terrorist groups.
[01:46:37.037 --> 01:46:43.986]  So, we've got Norway, we've got Switzerland and others saying they're finding this on the phones.
[01:46:45.649 --> 01:46:57.643]  Earlier this month, a newly uncovered ISIS manifesto bragged about how the terror organization was planning on exploiting a refugee program to infiltrate jihadists into Europe and sent up radicalization Muslim ghettos in major cities.
[01:46:57.643 --> 01:47:00.666]  Let's stop right there.
[01:47:00.666 --> 01:47:04.611]  It was in February, just search, ISIS promises to send
[01:47:07.802 --> 01:47:11.884]  Migrant wave or immigration wave into Europe filled with ISIS.
[01:47:11.884 --> 01:47:12.845]  They've said it.
[01:47:12.845 --> 01:47:14.446]  It was proclaimed by their leader.
[01:47:14.446 --> 01:47:16.127]  It was put out in online orders.
[01:47:16.127 --> 01:47:20.249]  Now it's in a battle plan given to the people how to do it.
[01:47:20.249 --> 01:47:21.150]  So you even have the blueprint.
[01:47:21.150 --> 01:47:22.611]  There it is.
[01:47:22.611 --> 01:47:24.612]  There is the report from February 16th.
[01:47:24.612 --> 01:47:26.533]  February 18th this year.
[01:47:29.224 --> 01:47:42.208]  ISIS threatens to send 500,000 migrants, well I guess they quadrupled their promise, as a psychological weapon in chilling echo of Qaddafi's prophecy that the Mediterranean will become a sea of chaos.
[01:47:42.208 --> 01:47:46.710]  But now there's a new ISIS manifesto linked up on Infowars.com and DrudgeReport.com.
[01:47:46.710 --> 01:47:58.414]  Earlier this month, a newly uncovered ISIS manifesto bragged about how the terror organization was planning on exploiting the refugee program to infiltrate jihadists into Europe and set up a radicalized Muslim ghettos in major cities.
[01:48:00.546 --> 01:48:20.656]  At least three individuals who pose as refugees have now been connected to the 13th Paris attack, including the mastermind behind the plot, Durka Durka Muhammad Jihad, Abdel Ahmad Amado Blago Snago, or whatever his name is, who brazenly revealed how he exploited the migrant red carpet to plot bloodshed.
[01:48:24.065 --> 01:48:37.373]  Earlier this month, an 18-year-old asylum seeker who was arrested in the Netherlands after he reportedly told other refugees that he fought alongside Al-Qaeda and ISIS in Syria.
[01:48:37.373 --> 01:48:41.395]  But it's okay because we can open up the borders.
[01:48:41.395 --> 01:48:46.238]  We can open up the borders and just let whoever they want into the country.
[01:48:47.708 --> 01:48:53.152]  And then Melissa Harris Perry says we're not even supposed to show Malik in her burka because that's racist.
[01:48:53.152 --> 01:48:54.553]  She controls all reality.
[01:48:54.553 --> 01:48:59.216]  Don't even show us the face of terror of 98% of terror.
[01:48:59.216 --> 01:49:01.998]  Don't show it to us because she said so.
[01:49:01.998 --> 01:49:04.399]  She also says Darth Vader is racist and evil.
[01:49:04.399 --> 01:49:05.921]  And by the way, I played this earlier.
[01:49:05.921 --> 01:49:07.221]  I want to play it one more time.
[01:49:07.221 --> 01:49:10.544]  Can we cue up Melissa Harris Perry and Darth Vader?
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:16.743]  Melissa Harris-Perry, like Princess Leia, is like, I'm just here to be sweet and loving and take care of everybody.
[01:49:16.743 --> 01:49:19.985]  You are part of a plan to destroy language and an enemy.
[01:49:19.985 --> 01:49:22.267]  Take her away!
[01:49:22.267 --> 01:49:23.828]  Holding her is dangerous.
[01:49:23.828 --> 01:49:28.391]  If the Predator race from deep space hears that we have her, they may send their own spaceships to attack us, sir.
[01:49:28.391 --> 01:49:32.294]  Leave that to me.
[01:49:32.294 --> 01:49:33.715]  Let's go ahead and play the clip.
[01:49:33.715 --> 01:49:33.955]  Here it is.
[01:49:35.162 --> 01:49:39.627]  Because I know why I have feelings, good, bad, and otherwise, about Star Wars.
[01:49:39.627 --> 01:49:40.689]  And I have a lot.
[01:49:40.689 --> 01:49:45.435]  I spent the whole day talking about the whole Darth Vader situation.
[01:49:45.435 --> 01:49:46.676]  Really?
[01:49:46.676 --> 01:49:47.237]  You could?
[01:49:47.237 --> 01:49:52.944]  Yeah, like, the part where he was totally a black guy, whose name basically was James Earl Jones.
[01:49:54.005 --> 01:50:00.587]  But while he was black, he was terrible and bad and awful and used to cut off white men's hands and didn't, you know, actually claim his son.
[01:50:00.587 --> 01:50:03.928]  But as soon as he claims his son and goes over to the good, he takes off his mask and he is white.
[01:50:03.928 --> 01:50:11.830]  Oh, yes, I have many, many feelings about that, but I will try to put them over here.
[01:50:11.830 --> 01:50:15.852]  You're free to use any means necessary, but I want them alive.
[01:50:15.852 --> 01:50:18.172]  No disintegrations.
[01:50:18.172 --> 01:50:20.033]  Her brain has obviously been disintegrated.
[01:50:22.568 --> 01:50:26.370]  We're going to take a break and come back with J.R.
[01:50:26.370 --> 01:50:27.330]  from Dallas, of course.
[01:50:27.330 --> 01:50:30.171]  No, he's from Texas, but it probably is Dallas.
[01:50:30.171 --> 01:50:33.973]  Say hi to Sue Ellen, J.R.
[01:50:33.973 --> 01:50:34.733]  If your name's J.R.
[01:50:34.733 --> 01:50:37.614]  and you're from Texas, you know it's a good old boy.
[01:50:37.614 --> 01:50:38.615]  Seriously, when we come back...
[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:40.481]  We're going to take your phone calls.
[01:50:40.481 --> 01:50:41.322]  I'm going to get into Russia.
[01:50:41.322 --> 01:50:44.285]  Warns Turkey over a G and Warship incident.
[01:50:44.285 --> 01:50:47.889]  How the establishment is planning to bring down Donald Trump and more.
[01:50:47.889 --> 01:50:55.738]  And then from Britannic Isle of Albion, Paul Watson and the former head of the English Defense League.
[01:50:55.738 --> 01:50:56.739]  It's all coming up.
[01:50:56.739 --> 01:50:58.141]  InfoWars.com.
[01:51:00.117 --> 01:51:01.478]  Are you prepared to bug out?

[01:51:59.642 --> 01:52:03.905]  With a new year coming, it's time for a new way to look at weapon storage.
[01:52:03.905 --> 01:52:07.147]  Safes can't be accessed quickly and racks are unsafe for children.
[01:52:07.147 --> 01:52:09.728]  Covert Cabinets are the next level in home defense.
[01:52:09.728 --> 01:52:15.171]  They fit seamlessly into any home's decor and they provide quick access to firearms while keeping them uniquely hidden.

[01:52:59.378 --> 01:53:03.261]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:53:03.261 --> 01:53:08.265]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[01:53:08.265 --> 01:53:13.089]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[01:53:13.089 --> 01:53:14.450]  Don't just take my word for it.

[01:53:19.214 --> 01:53:19.594]  That's 866-295-5305.
[01:53:19.594 --> 01:53:20.135]  HBExtract.com.
[01:53:20.135 --> 01:53:22.437]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:53:29.150 --> 01:53:32.212]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:53:32.212 --> 01:53:34.833]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:53:34.833 --> 01:53:35.594]  Croix River.
[01:53:35.594 --> 01:53:36.635]  I loved my dad.
[01:53:36.635 --> 01:53:37.815]  The boy was too stubborn.
[01:53:37.815 --> 01:53:40.777]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:53:40.777 --> 01:53:41.658]  His excuse?
[01:53:41.658 --> 01:53:42.998]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:53:42.998 --> 01:53:44.599]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:53:44.599 --> 01:53:50.363]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[01:53:50.363 --> 01:53:51.404]  Don't wait.
[01:53:51.404 --> 01:53:54.065]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now.
[01:53:54.065 --> 01:53:56.547]  For not just your sake, but for the sake of your loved ones.
[01:53:56.547 --> 01:53:58.148]  Again, that's LibertyOnCall.org.
[01:54:23.442 --> 01:54:25.003]  Coming up, we're going to look at the economy.
[01:54:25.003 --> 01:54:29.144]  Also, more and more top scientists warn of robot takeovers.
[01:54:29.144 --> 01:54:41.288]  Well, the reason that's a certainty is that the social engineers, the social controllers, the transhumanist eugenicists openly say humanity's time has come to end.
[01:54:41.288 --> 01:54:52.132]  And that they've decided to direct the development of society, of the culture, of the technological systems to become basically a technological terror, to quote Darth Vader, since we're on that subject.
[01:54:53.547 --> 01:54:58.931]  To dominate and control all facets of human life, to make humanity exempt.
[01:54:58.931 --> 01:55:02.353]  So the decision has been made to build the architecture in this way.
[01:55:02.353 --> 01:55:10.819]  If we simply vote with our dollars before the architecture is complete, and build the architecture the way we want to, it will be empowering.
[01:55:10.819 --> 01:55:14.882]  But the ultimate selfishness of the globalists is to basically end all of that.
[01:55:16.766 --> 01:55:18.367]  There's another video I'm going to get to next hour.
[01:55:18.367 --> 01:55:21.288]  Look at what Muslim refugees left behind on the Autobahn.
[01:55:21.288 --> 01:55:23.970]  It's a metaphor for what's being brought to society.
[01:55:23.970 --> 01:55:24.950]  Pretty powerful.
[01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:25.591]  That's coming up.
[01:55:25.591 --> 01:55:27.232]  The Russian situation more.
[01:55:27.232 --> 01:55:40.779]  Before I go to your calls in the next segment though, ahead of guest, I just want to say that we have a special that we offer only one time during the year.
[01:55:40.779 --> 01:55:43.461]  We broke that rule one day a few weeks ago and offered
[01:55:44.682 --> 01:55:46.444]  Half off again for one day.
[01:55:46.444 --> 01:55:47.665]  It was very successful.
[01:55:47.665 --> 01:55:51.508]  But we always do it around Christmas and sometimes into January a little bit.
[01:55:51.508 --> 01:55:55.392]  Six months free for InfoWars Nightly News, all the films, all of it.
[01:55:55.392 --> 01:55:57.994]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:55:57.994 --> 01:55:58.694]  Six months free.
[01:55:59.764 --> 01:56:01.866]  And it's normally $54.95 for a year.
[01:56:01.866 --> 01:56:03.427]  You get a few months free then.
[01:56:03.427 --> 01:56:04.708]  Now it's $36.50.
[01:56:04.708 --> 01:56:07.290]  So that's six months off the regular price.
[01:56:07.290 --> 01:56:09.832]  Again, it's already a few months off normally.
[01:56:09.832 --> 01:56:11.234]  Now you get six months off.
[01:56:11.234 --> 01:56:13.135]  $36 instead of $54.
[01:56:13.135 --> 01:56:15.837]  Twenty people can use the same username.
[01:56:15.837 --> 01:56:17.419]  So you go sign up with your username.
[01:56:18.848 --> 01:56:31.637]  You create a username that you can share, you know, that's original to the site, and then give it to friends and family and say, hey, go see these films, go see these documentaries, see the nightly news, see it on your iPhone, see it on your Droid, see it when you're overseas, listen to it when you're driving down the road in your truck.
[01:56:31.637 --> 01:56:33.939]  Sure, we put almost everything on YouTube and other platforms.
[01:56:33.939 --> 01:56:35.400]  They censor us routinely.
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:36.081]  So does Facebook.
[01:56:36.081 --> 01:56:38.262]  We still use it, but they censor us.
[01:56:38.262 --> 01:56:40.684]  That's why we have to have our own platform, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:56:42.665 --> 01:56:47.227]  Drudge and others have talked about how important it is that we have our own platforms, not just other people's platforms.
[01:56:47.227 --> 01:56:54.631]  So PrisonPlanet.tv, your membership pays for the bandwidth, so many of the cameras, the crew, so much of it.
[01:56:54.631 --> 01:56:57.152]  It's essential you become a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[01:56:57.152 --> 01:57:02.555]  And this is all, this is as good as it gets close to free.
[01:57:02.555 --> 01:57:06.637]  Six months off the regular price, $36 and what is it, 50 cents or something? $36.50.
[01:57:09.923 --> 01:57:10.843]  That's what it comes down to.
[01:57:10.843 --> 01:57:13.725]  12 months, 20 people can use it.
[01:57:13.725 --> 01:57:17.386]  PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWarsNews.com.
[01:57:17.386 --> 01:57:19.867]  Pay with PayPal, pay with credit card.
[01:57:19.867 --> 01:57:26.990]  You can also call us if you want with a check or money order or whatever and then they'll digitally create it for you if you don't even want to have that connection or whatever.
[01:57:26.990 --> 01:57:35.874]  Some people do it that way or you want us to generate username and passcodes and then mail letters to friends and family because you're not online but you want them to get a card saying here's your username and passcode.
[01:57:37.090 --> 01:57:40.092]  You know, to PrisonPlanet.tv, you can do that.
[01:57:40.092 --> 01:57:44.415]  And lastly, we've got a bunch of specials that end on the 18th.
[01:57:44.415 --> 01:57:46.257]  Free shipping ends on the 18th.
[01:57:46.257 --> 01:57:52.781]  We have the Essential Pack, Survival Shield, Niacin Iodine, Super Miller Female Vitality, and Silver Bullet, 33% off.
[01:57:52.781 --> 01:57:56.724]  What a great gift to give if you already have it for yourself, or give it to yourself.
[01:57:56.724 --> 01:58:00.987]  The Cleanse Pack, Deep Cleanse, Living Defense, and Oxy Powder, whoa, 28% off.
[01:58:00.987 --> 01:58:02.328]  Winter Sun, 15% off.

[01:58:06.471 --> 01:58:09.776]  Wake up a friend to get great, high-quality, high-mountain Mexican coffee.
[01:58:09.776 --> 01:58:10.737]  My favorite.
[01:58:10.737 --> 01:58:13.421]  Non-GMO, organically grown, volcanic soil.
[01:58:13.421 --> 01:58:17.767]  Get a free coffee mug with Wake Up America Coffee.

[01:58:21.513 --> 01:58:22.374]  They told me that was sold out.
[01:58:22.374 --> 01:58:23.694]  There's about 10 of those left.
[01:58:23.694 --> 01:58:26.376]  We have the new big solar-packed systems as well.
[01:58:26.376 --> 01:58:30.899]  InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.

[01:58:37.883 --> 01:58:38.984]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:38.984 --> 01:58:41.485]  Shop with the good guys and spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:58:41.485 --> 01:58:42.446]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:42.446 --> 01:58:46.048]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:49.867 --> 01:58:50.468]  I want more candy!
[01:58:50.468 --> 01:58:51.609]  I want more baby again!
[01:58:51.609 --> 01:58:53.130]  Mine, mine, mine!
[01:58:53.130 --> 01:59:02.859]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:59:02.859 --> 01:59:05.562]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:59:05.562 --> 01:59:09.105]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:59:09.105 --> 01:59:11.868]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system.
[01:59:11.988 --> 01:59:12.228]  I'm good.
[01:59:30.034 --> 01:59:31.295]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:14.585 --> 02:00:15.345]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:15.345 --> 02:00:18.306]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:18.306 --> 02:00:44.030]  I don't want to be I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your I don't want to be in your
[02:00:46.681 --> 02:00:51.943]  They call us walking corpses.
[02:00:51.943 --> 02:00:54.465]  They'd like to lock us up.
[02:00:54.465 --> 02:00:57.906]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[02:00:57.906 --> 02:01:00.667]  to 2 p.m.
[02:01:00.667 --> 02:01:02.808]  Central Standard Time.
[02:01:02.808 --> 02:01:08.991]  Or you can hear me butcher the misfits.
[02:01:08.991 --> 02:01:12.493]  I love this when I was about 12 years old.
[02:01:12.493 --> 02:01:13.013]  Still do, too.
[02:01:15.327 --> 02:01:20.633]  And I learned real quick, girls like it when you're wearing a misfit shirt and a black cowboy hat, black jeans and black boots.
[02:01:20.633 --> 02:01:25.878]  They like that mix.
[02:01:25.878 --> 02:01:29.582]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're taking your phone calls right now.
[02:01:29.582 --> 02:01:31.044]  Now wearing a misfit shirt is pretty nerdy.
[02:01:31.044 --> 02:01:33.907]  You only see like 60-year-olds trying to act cool wearing them.
[02:01:33.907 --> 02:01:35.268]  I'm about to go to J.R.
[02:01:35.268 --> 02:01:35.709]  and others.
[02:01:40.026 --> 02:01:42.853]  But I tell you, all is good in the world.
[02:01:42.853 --> 02:01:49.187]  When I go to Infowars.com and I see the headline, Kurt Russell blasts gun control push, I think it's absolutely insane.
[02:01:54.158 --> 02:01:55.858]  I was just thinking about Kurt Russell a few weeks ago.
[02:01:55.858 --> 02:01:58.359]  I hadn't seen Escape from New York in like a decade.
[02:01:58.359 --> 02:01:59.519]  I let my son watch it.
[02:01:59.519 --> 02:02:01.540]  He was 13.
[02:02:01.540 --> 02:02:07.381]  And after the girls went to bed one night, let him stay up late with me and he was like, this is really good.
[02:02:07.381 --> 02:02:09.262]  And I was like, yeah, this is old fashioned stuff.
[02:02:09.262 --> 02:02:11.142]  Old fashioned action.
[02:02:11.142 --> 02:02:14.443]  And I was like, yeah, I remember getting told he was a listener, but it was almost like it's vague.
[02:02:14.443 --> 02:02:15.263]  It was like six years ago.
[02:02:15.263 --> 02:02:17.124]  I was like, I just know he's a patriot.
[02:02:17.124 --> 02:02:18.024]  I need to get him on.
[02:02:19.226 --> 02:02:22.932]  And then you see something like that, it's just so good.
[02:02:22.932 --> 02:02:25.756]  You love an actor and you don't want to see him be a piece of garbage, you know?
[02:02:25.756 --> 02:02:28.380]  It's just wonderful.
[02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:29.281]  J.R.
[02:02:29.281 --> 02:02:30.823]  in the great state of Tejas.
[02:02:30.823 --> 02:02:31.604]  Thank you for holding, sir.
[02:02:33.414 --> 02:02:34.354]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:34.354 --> 02:02:37.055]  I'm down here in Austin hiding out from Sue Ellen.
[02:02:37.055 --> 02:02:48.197]  But anyway, I don't hear anybody bringing up like we did with Obama being born somewhere else.
[02:02:48.197 --> 02:02:53.538]  And he was born in Canada, you know, with the U.S.
[02:02:53.538 --> 02:02:55.739]  mama and the Cuban daddy.
[02:02:55.739 --> 02:02:56.519]  And hell, he had
[02:02:57.734 --> 02:03:00.656]  Dual citizenship until last year.
[02:03:00.656 --> 02:03:03.297]  Well, I think Obama avoided that.
[02:03:03.297 --> 02:03:04.718]  But, of course, he really was born in Hawaii.
[02:03:04.718 --> 02:03:10.881]  That was all a big shill to get us away from who his really dad was, the top communist, basically, in the country for the KGB.
[02:03:10.881 --> 02:03:12.282]  I mean, you can't mix that up.
[02:03:12.282 --> 02:03:14.122]  He admits he used to live with him.
[02:03:14.122 --> 02:03:16.264]  I mean, it's like hiding in plain view.
[02:03:16.264 --> 02:03:21.286]  Frank Marshall Davis lived with him for 10 years, pretty much, on the summers.
[02:03:21.286 --> 02:03:26.369]  But with Cruz, the law is pretty clear, though, that if his mother
[02:03:28.331 --> 02:03:33.315]  I don't know, I just know that it seems to me about the same thing with Obama.
[02:03:33.315 --> 02:03:33.815]  Yes, sir.
[02:03:33.815 --> 02:03:41.441]  I was wondering also, do we know anything about, I know I read a year or two ago about
[02:03:59.596 --> 02:04:00.897]  I'm not bashing Cruz.
[02:04:00.897 --> 02:04:01.537]  I like him.
[02:04:01.537 --> 02:04:05.680]  I wish we had more... No, no, I know it's important to ask questions, sir.
[02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:06.260]  You're absolutely right.
[02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:08.462]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[02:04:08.462 --> 02:04:13.986]  About... I read where he was, I guess, one of the lawyers that helped write the...
[02:04:14.761 --> 02:04:20.945]  That North American treaty that Bush signed with Celente Fox and the Canadian person.
[02:04:20.945 --> 02:04:22.667]  Yes, there were a bunch of lawyers involved.
[02:04:22.667 --> 02:04:23.907]  He reportedly was part of one.
[02:04:23.907 --> 02:04:27.910]  There were thousands involved, but he was reportedly involved in some sections of it.
[02:04:27.910 --> 02:04:32.253]  And, you know, Donald Trump should bring that up to him.
[02:04:32.253 --> 02:04:35.656]  Trump said NAFTA and GATT and all that's a bad idea.
[02:04:35.656 --> 02:04:41.380]  Also, I have one more thing for you that I've come to realize that common sense equals racism.
[02:04:43.379 --> 02:04:45.382]  That is a good bumper sticker, absolutely.
[02:04:45.382 --> 02:04:47.685]  Well, we know Darth Vader's now racist, sir.
[02:04:47.685 --> 02:04:49.708]  I mean, MSNBC said it.
[02:04:49.708 --> 02:04:50.168]  It's true.
[02:04:50.168 --> 02:04:52.151]  And if you don't agree with her, you're a racist.
[02:04:52.151 --> 02:04:55.155]  Melissa Harris Perry is basically the Oracle.
[02:04:55.155 --> 02:04:56.897]  I mean, she is truth incarnate.
[02:04:59.870 --> 02:05:03.892]  In response to Donald Trump's proposal to ban non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S.
[02:05:03.892 --> 02:05:11.836]  without being properly vetted, Senate Democrats may attempt to create a so-called civil right for anyone, including ISIS militants, to immigrate to the U.S.
[02:05:11.836 --> 02:05:16.458]  Senator Pat Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, proposed an amendment to Title 18 of the U.S.
[02:05:16.458 --> 02:05:27.583]  Code to stop the federal government from banning individuals from entering into the United States based on their religion, which would create a dangerous precedent where illegal aliens could claim immigration laws preventing their entry into the U.S.
[02:05:27.583 --> 02:05:28.984]  to violate their civil rights.
[02:05:29.404 --> 02:05:44.972]  In response to the amendment, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions said, quote, It is a move towards the ratification of the idea that global migration is a so-called human right, and that the so-called immigrant's rights must be supreme to the rights of sovereign nations to determine who can and cannot enter their borders.
[02:05:44.972 --> 02:05:54.717]  Sessions also warned that any alien-denied entry could file suits to ban entry and claim damages for lost employment, lost welfare benefits, lost income, etc.

[02:07:48.311 --> 02:07:50.432]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:21.106 --> 02:08:25.189]  It's an article on a Breitbart in London, enemy of the state.
[02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:31.573]  Tommy Robinson's new book says he believes the state tried to have him killed.
[02:08:31.573 --> 02:08:39.939]  And speaking of the devil, he may have to pop off for a moment with the police coming to his house just here in a moment due to some issues with the ongoing threats and the rest of it.
[02:08:39.939 --> 02:08:41.820]  We were just notified of that.
[02:08:41.820 --> 02:08:47.784]  Tommy Robinson imprisoned to stop Mohammed cartoon contest UK cops won't deny.
[02:08:48.689 --> 02:08:51.751]  And they actually came out when he went to a protest and arrested him.
[02:08:51.751 --> 02:08:57.454]  We have the photos and the video up on Infowars.com.
[02:08:57.454 --> 02:09:03.817]  Paul Joseph Watson is hosting the fourth hour today, but he'll also be riding shotgun with us to talk about this.
[02:09:03.817 --> 02:09:13.863]  Of course, Tommy Robinson is the former leader of the English Defense League, and he used to quote, front new anti-Islam movement.
[02:09:13.863 --> 02:09:17.025]  Now he founded the group, and we have his
[02:09:19.215 --> 02:09:20.556]  Bio right here.
[02:09:20.556 --> 02:09:23.617]  And when it started becoming racist, getting taken over, he got out of it.
[02:09:23.617 --> 02:09:28.740]  So he has the white supremacist after him and he has the radical islamicist after him.
[02:09:28.740 --> 02:09:32.301]  He's the founder and ex-leader of the English Defense League.
[02:09:32.301 --> 02:09:33.782]  Formed in 2009.
[02:09:33.782 --> 02:09:35.143]  He's leaving the EDL.
[02:09:35.143 --> 02:09:41.546]  He has become an avid speaker on the problems of the western world and the rise of extremism, Islam, ISIS, hate speech, and Syria.
[02:09:43.351 --> 02:09:46.212]  And of course, people that try to even talk like this from the U.S.
[02:09:46.212 --> 02:09:51.813]  and fly there like Michael Savage, get barred from the country, or from the U.K.
[02:09:51.813 --> 02:10:00.015]  And he joins us, he's founded a new organization, Patriotic Europeans Towards Islamification of the West.
[02:10:00.015 --> 02:10:02.996]  With regards to the setting up of the group, the U.K.
[02:10:02.996 --> 02:10:05.057]  has arranged peaceful silent walk that will be held
[02:10:05.987 --> 02:10:13.653]  And then he goes through that coming up on the 6th of February, 2016, with 12 other European countries.
[02:10:13.653 --> 02:10:19.357]  His most recent book is called Enemy of the State, TommyRobinson.co.uk.
[02:10:19.357 --> 02:10:24.081]  And Paul Watson knows his story a lot better than I do, and I know who he is and have followed it some.
[02:10:24.081 --> 02:10:30.286]  But let's go to Paul Watson first, and then he can introduce Mr. Robinson and kind of conduct some of this interview with me here today.
[02:10:30.286 --> 02:10:34.589]  Again, joining us from London, Paul Watson.
[02:10:34.589 --> 02:10:35.029]  Hi, Alex.
[02:10:35.029 --> 02:10:35.570]  Good to be here.
[02:10:37.170 --> 02:10:42.131]  You recommended this guest, and it's a good idea to have him on, but for those that don't know the inside baseball, break some of it down.
[02:10:42.131 --> 02:10:49.133]  I mean, you were just in Brussels, Belgium, where you were run out repeatedly from areas where the Islamists were at, just in the open streets.
[02:10:49.133 --> 02:10:50.733]  You'll get out of here.
[02:10:50.733 --> 02:10:53.053]  You guys were basically accosted in Paris.
[02:10:53.053 --> 02:11:00.675]  I don't think people realize just how aggressive these folks have gotten, and the fact that they are not integrating with society.
[02:11:02.386 --> 02:11:13.376]  Well yeah, we visited Molenbeek in Belgium a few weeks ago now to check on reports that this was the jihadist capital of Europe, that's what it was called.
[02:11:13.376 --> 02:11:19.561]  The left, for a long time, and it cropped up again recently last week with the whole Ban Trump controversy,
[02:11:20.462 --> 02:11:26.607]  Claim that this is a conspiracy theory that these Muslim ghettos, where these terrorists are radicalised, even exist.
[02:11:26.607 --> 02:11:31.610]  And in fact, Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, came out and said, these areas don't exist.
[02:11:31.610 --> 02:11:38.035]  I invite Mr Trump to come over and visit and I will walk around with him to show him that these areas are completely safe.
[02:11:38.035 --> 02:11:43.139]  Of course, if that ever happened, he would be surrounded by 20 news cameras and about 15 cops.
[02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:49.363]  So, of course, any area in that situation is going to be relatively safe.
[02:11:49.363 --> 02:11:59.168]  We went into Molenbeek on our own, just as it was getting dark, and we were basically harassed, discriminated against racially, and chased out of there.
[02:11:59.168 --> 02:12:08.613]  Again, proving that these Muslim no-go areas... Followed by cars, thrown out of restaurants, thrown out of convenience stores, could not get service at open businesses.
[02:12:08.613 --> 02:12:11.034]  They said, not for you, and began screaming it out.
[02:12:12.822 --> 02:12:21.885]  Exactly, but of course, Tommy Robinson has been facing this and speaking out against it for a lot longer than I have, so if you could introduce him, that would be good to go.
[02:12:21.885 --> 02:12:22.485]  Absolutely.
[02:12:22.485 --> 02:12:25.826]  Mr. Robinson, I mean, I don't know where to start with the saga that you've been through.
[02:12:25.826 --> 02:12:30.287]  For folks that don't know, spend the next five minutes or so for our U.S.
[02:12:30.287 --> 02:12:32.848]  audience and others, exactly what you've been through.
[02:12:34.511 --> 02:12:41.777]  So I started in 2000 and in 2004 I held a first demonstration I organised when I was when I was 21 years old.
[02:12:41.777 --> 02:12:43.578]  That was against a group called Al Majrodeen.
[02:12:43.578 --> 02:12:46.580]  I'd seen them in my hometown radicalising and recruiting.
[02:12:46.580 --> 02:12:49.302]  This was before 7-7, before any terrorist attacks on our shores.
[02:12:49.302 --> 02:12:54.226]  I started reading into this group and understanding the ideology that has spawned ISIS.
[02:12:54.226 --> 02:12:57.488]  I'd become alarmed and concerned so I organised my first demonstration.
[02:12:58.351 --> 02:13:00.912]  The response to that, as a young 21-year-old, I was attacked.
[02:13:00.912 --> 02:13:02.252]  My house was attacked.
[02:13:02.252 --> 02:13:04.433]  And I had to go into hiding for a little while.
[02:13:04.433 --> 02:13:09.414]  And five years later, our soldiers were parading through my hometown of Luton.
[02:13:09.414 --> 02:13:11.635]  When you talk about Mullenbeek, I talk about Luton.
[02:13:11.635 --> 02:13:15.716]  Luton has been named by the CIA, I believe, as the epicentre of European terrorist activity.
[02:13:16.198 --> 02:13:23.184]  We had the Stockholm bomber, we had the fertilizer bomb plot, the 7-7 bombers come and took their bombs from Luton and boarded the train in Luton.
[02:13:23.184 --> 02:13:28.789]  We've had numerous, just last week another four Muslims arrested on terrorist plot in Britain, in Luton.
[02:13:28.789 --> 02:13:32.732]  So I've grown up seeing the town change.
[02:13:32.732 --> 02:13:34.954]  In my hometown there's 30 mosques.
[02:13:34.954 --> 02:13:37.396]  There's 40 to 50,000 Muslims.
[02:13:37.396 --> 02:13:38.017]  We're a small town.
[02:13:39.095 --> 02:13:40.736]  I've seen the effect of it.
[02:13:40.736 --> 02:13:44.657]  I've had a, I don't know if you've heard of the sexual grooming, which should be referred to as rape jihad.
[02:13:44.657 --> 02:13:46.557]  I had a cousin who was victim of that.
[02:13:46.557 --> 02:13:49.458]  I've lived it for my whole life.
[02:13:49.458 --> 02:13:56.220]  Now when the final straw was the soldiers homecoming parade, when our soldiers were parading through our hometown and they were attacked, they were spat at.
[02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:59.681]  They were called butchers of Basra, baby killers, murderers.
[02:13:59.681 --> 02:14:01.542]  One of the soldiers' mums, they spat in her face.
[02:14:02.543 --> 02:14:03.684]  That was the final straw.
[02:14:03.684 --> 02:14:10.673]  Now that spawned and gave birth to a group called the United People of Luton which therefore turned into the English Defence League.
[02:14:10.673 --> 02:14:15.179]  I was 26 years old and within six months I was leading the biggest street protest movement Europe's seen.
[02:14:16.445 --> 02:14:18.667]  We made mistakes, regrettably.
[02:14:18.667 --> 02:14:26.132]  But at the same time, what we managed to do was bring to the forefront and bring to discussion all of the negative problems that we see in our communities.
[02:14:26.132 --> 02:14:35.738]  Whether that be sexual grooming, which had been suppressed and hidden, a conspiracy of silence with Muslim leaders, political leaders, social services, politicians.
[02:14:35.738 --> 02:14:39.300]  They all conspired to allow and facilitate the rape of our youth.
[02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:53.525]  And for those that don't know, you talked about this ten years ago, and now it's come out that the CPS, the police have been ordered, in some cases thousands of young girls being kidnapped and raped, but because Muslims are doing it, they're saying they are above the law.
[02:14:53.525 --> 02:14:59.186]  That's actually now, a decade after you first talked about it, that's now been proven in mainstream British news.
[02:14:59.186 --> 02:15:00.527]  Yeah, we've been vindicated.
[02:15:00.527 --> 02:15:03.828]  To be honest, six years ago, politically, it was a very different landscape in Britain.
[02:15:03.828 --> 02:15:06.969]  When we first came out talking about these issues, we were called extremists simply for
[02:15:08.381 --> 02:15:11.882]  Six years on, we've been vindicated, we've been proven right about everything we're saying.
[02:15:11.882 --> 02:15:17.103]  There were genuine concerns and fears in our community where we live, not where the politicians live, but where we live.
[02:15:17.103 --> 02:15:27.465]  And you're right, in one town there was 1,400 children raped, 1,400 girls raped, passed around by gangs and gangs of Muslim men, and who were allowed to do so by the police, by the council, by the government.
[02:15:27.465 --> 02:15:31.825]  And that there should be a warning to the world about how powerful political correctness is.
[02:15:31.825 --> 02:15:32.966]  That's how powerful it is.
[02:15:32.966 --> 02:15:35.106]  They will stand by and watch young girls be raped.
[02:15:35.606 --> 02:15:47.394]  And for those that don't know, in these more radical Muslim cultures like Saudi Arabia and other areas, women are property enslaved, men are allowed to rape the women, and if the women speak out, they get executed for being raped.
[02:15:47.394 --> 02:15:53.198]  So, that's why you see all these imams saying, we're coming, we're going to get your women, we're going to jihad them.
[02:15:53.198 --> 02:15:56.060]  This is an open tenet by, you know, top
[02:15:56.260 --> 02:15:59.022]  I mean, head imams in Jerusalem, Australia.
[02:15:59.022 --> 02:16:00.083]  It's really crazy.
[02:16:00.083 --> 02:16:02.345]  They actually say on tape, we're coming to get your women.
[02:16:02.345 --> 02:16:03.486]  You can't stop us.
[02:16:03.486 --> 02:16:06.849]  And now in Europe, it's happening and the police are being ordered to cover it up.
[02:16:06.849 --> 02:16:11.953]  I mean, some German towns of 100 have had 700 Islamists brought in.
[02:16:11.953 --> 02:16:13.134]  It's going to be much worse than England.
[02:16:13.134 --> 02:16:14.835]  What do you expect that to be like?
[02:16:14.835 --> 02:16:15.856]  I've been to Germany.
[02:16:15.856 --> 02:16:17.617]  I've recently traveled around Europe.
[02:16:17.617 --> 02:16:18.558]  I met with PEGIDA.
[02:16:18.558 --> 02:16:22.101]  PEGIDA is the organization that formed 12 months ago in Dresden.
[02:16:22.968 --> 02:16:27.192]  When I went to speak at their rally, there was 40,000 concerned Germans there.
[02:16:27.192 --> 02:16:34.937]  In some city that you talk about, in one town with a population of 13,000, they put 8,000 Muslim men, so-called refugees.
[02:16:34.937 --> 02:16:36.439]  In another town with a population of 3,000, they put 2,500.
[02:16:38.710 --> 02:16:42.553]  Overnight, their towns have been taken over, their women are having to stay in the house.
[02:16:42.553 --> 02:16:48.137]  We've seen rapes from so-called refugees, from five Syrians in England.
[02:16:48.137 --> 02:16:50.839]  We've seen it in Denmark when children have been raped.
[02:16:50.839 --> 02:16:51.860]  We've seen it in Sweden.
[02:16:51.860 --> 02:16:52.800]  We've seen it in Germany.
[02:16:52.800 --> 02:16:57.644]  Multiple, multiple times have these so-called refugees been raping the host nation's women.
[02:16:58.144 --> 02:17:03.890]  Now, this is, this is, we need to realise a street level jihad, a rape jihad, has been going on.
[02:17:03.890 --> 02:17:10.896]  In Britain, 90%, 90% of the street level grooming gang convictions are Muslim men.
[02:17:10.896 --> 02:17:11.417]  90%.
[02:17:11.417 --> 02:17:13.879]  Only 4% of our country is Muslim.
[02:17:13.879 --> 02:17:14.920]  And that's not all men.
[02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:16.001]  Only 4% is Muslim.
[02:17:16.001 --> 02:17:17.663]  So say 2% are Muslim men.
[02:17:17.663 --> 02:17:21.026]  They're responsible for 90% of convictions for grooming gangs.
[02:17:21.026 --> 02:17:21.987]  20% of those men are called Mohammed.
[02:17:22.634 --> 02:17:28.415]  We have a serious problem and simply what we face for simply speaking out.
[02:17:28.415 --> 02:17:47.100]  I think when people listen to the full story of what we've gone through and what the state and the government and the police have done, not just to myself but to other members and other people who have tried to voice their concerns, people will be shocked to realise that we all think we live in a democracy with freedom of speech, we think we have these God-given rights.
[02:17:47.100 --> 02:17:47.940]  We don't.
[02:17:47.940 --> 02:17:50.261]  You try and exercise them, you will realise you don't.
[02:17:50.261 --> 02:17:51.981]  And what America needs to understand
[02:17:52.671 --> 02:17:56.234]  And they need to get ready for is everything that's happening here.
[02:17:56.234 --> 02:18:00.237]  Everything that's happened here is coming to America.
[02:18:00.237 --> 02:18:05.501]  I want to go to break, come back at Paul's brief response and then you're welcome to even ride into the next hour with him if you have the time.
[02:18:05.501 --> 02:18:07.903]  We have some special reports to be hearing as well at the bottom of that hour.
[02:18:07.903 --> 02:18:11.886]  But your story, you know, just following it is so over the top.
[02:18:12.762 --> 02:18:24.167]  That in most countries you'd be considered, you know, pretty moderate, but the way they spun it, the way they infiltrated, how they treated you, the way you've been arrested, where you're not even allowed to go out and demonstrate or give a speech in public.
[02:18:24.167 --> 02:18:26.227]  I mean, this is so draconian, but I want to ask you this question.
[02:18:26.227 --> 02:18:27.708]  We've got about a minute and a half.
[02:18:27.708 --> 02:18:30.289]  Why do you think the West wants to do this?
[02:18:30.289 --> 02:18:39.253]  Why would they want to bring in the most radical, incompatible, pretty much dark age cultures, and then let them have a free hand?
[02:18:39.253 --> 02:18:39.953]  What is the point?
[02:18:40.703 --> 02:18:42.765]  It's complete population replacement.
[02:18:42.765 --> 02:18:43.746]  That's what we're seeing.
[02:18:43.746 --> 02:18:45.487]  Look, forget the refugee crisis.
[02:18:45.487 --> 02:18:53.054]  If we didn't have the refugee crisis, we already face drastic, drastic times ahead of us without the refugee crisis.
[02:18:53.054 --> 02:18:54.315]  Ignore the refugee crisis.
[02:18:54.315 --> 02:18:56.737]  We have got Muslim ghettos across this country.
[02:18:56.737 --> 02:19:01.201]  We've got a population of simply only 4%, but every 10 years it doubles.
[02:19:01.201 --> 02:19:06.486]  We have seen them not integrate, not assimilate, and that's not every Muslim because there's some great Muslims in this country, but
[02:19:07.598 --> 02:19:09.380]  We don't see integration, we don't see assimilation.
[02:19:09.380 --> 02:19:11.943]  We've had 360 terrorist arrests this year.
[02:19:11.943 --> 02:19:14.686]  The terrorism arrest rate goes up 60% each year.
[02:19:14.686 --> 02:19:18.371]  37% of British Muslims said they wish for a Sharia law.
[02:19:18.371 --> 02:19:24.378]  What we've seen Donald Trump getting criticised for in this country, no one's talking about the reason why he said it.
[02:19:24.918 --> 02:19:29.282]  No one's talking about the fact that 20% of American Muslims believe they can kill to enforce Sharia law.
[02:19:29.282 --> 02:19:32.945]  No one's talking about 51% of American Muslims want Sharia law.
[02:19:32.945 --> 02:19:35.587]  What is the alternative to stopping Muslim immigration?
[02:19:35.587 --> 02:19:39.450]  The alternative for America not stopping the Muslim immigration is you are going to end up like Europe.
[02:19:39.450 --> 02:19:42.292]  You're going to end up with terrorism on a weekly basis across Europe.
[02:19:42.292 --> 02:19:43.734]  You're going to end up with Muslim ghettos.
[02:19:43.734 --> 02:19:46.656]  You're going to end up with grooming gangs, rape gangs, rape jihad.
[02:19:46.656 --> 02:19:49.018]  You're going to end up in the same predicament.
[02:19:49.018 --> 02:19:50.139]  Stay there, stay there, sir.
[02:19:50.139 --> 02:19:50.960]  Tommy Robinson.
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:52.861]  And what's sad is they don't want to...
[02:19:54.302 --> 02:20:00.285]  Integrate, and they're so upset and angry with chips on their shoulders, and we're just supposed to bow down and have our throats slit?

[02:24:06.279 --> 02:24:11.743]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:11.743 --> 02:24:18.208]  Coming up, Obama to expand modern-day slave trade with TPP.

[02:24:21.691 --> 02:24:22.952]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[02:24:23.652 --> 02:24:38.521]  One of the top Saudi princes that owns part of Fox News has come down telling Trump to shut up and to get out of the presidential race because he dares to say we shouldn't allow the refugees in when Saudi Arabia will not take one refugee.
[02:24:38.521 --> 02:24:38.981]  Not one.
[02:24:38.981 --> 02:24:42.523]  Even though they're running the war in Syria that caused most of it.
[02:24:42.523 --> 02:24:44.785]  Unbelievable arrogance.
[02:24:46.593 --> 02:24:48.413]  Simply insane.
[02:24:48.413 --> 02:24:49.794]  Tommy Robinson joins us.
[02:24:49.794 --> 02:24:52.054]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:24:52.054 --> 02:24:55.615]  TommyRobinson.co.uk.
[02:24:55.615 --> 02:25:01.397]  And imagine being branded like Trump is a bigot and a racist for just saying, we need to control our borders.
[02:25:01.397 --> 02:25:03.617]  We have serious ghettos being set up.
[02:25:03.617 --> 02:25:05.598]  We're being taken over.
[02:25:05.598 --> 02:25:06.838]  And there is an aggression.
[02:25:07.745 --> 02:25:16.530]  Not by the first, third, fourth wave Muslims that I knew in college and high school, or really nice folks who are professionals that really wanted to come here and get away from the suppression of these countries.
[02:25:16.530 --> 02:25:20.852]  No, they want to bring it here and force it on you and all these imams.
[02:25:20.852 --> 02:25:28.936]  We've played the clips, we're like, we're coming for your women, you are weak, we will take your women, it is a jihad, your women will wear the hajib, you will submit.
[02:25:28.936 --> 02:25:30.377]  I mean, that's almost every day.
[02:25:31.849 --> 02:25:34.671]  University, you know, head professors here in the U.S.
[02:25:34.671 --> 02:25:36.693]  The arrogance of these people!
[02:25:36.693 --> 02:25:37.794]  That we will usurp you!
[02:25:37.794 --> 02:25:38.314]  Ha ha ha!
[02:25:38.314 --> 02:25:38.694]  You are weak!
[02:25:38.694 --> 02:25:41.917]  And you're like, hey, that's really... You want to destroy my culture?
[02:25:41.917 --> 02:25:43.558]  Yes, I will, you filth!
[02:25:43.558 --> 02:25:45.459]  And you're like, well, that's not very nice.
[02:25:45.459 --> 02:25:46.300]  Shut up, racist!
[02:25:46.300 --> 02:25:48.342]  Ha ha ha!
[02:25:48.342 --> 02:25:49.342]  Tommy Robinson, help!
[02:25:50.379 --> 02:26:04.449]  I've seen them merge with the left, though, like this mayor of London that we have a clip of that you mentioned, and Paul mentioned saying, there are no no-go ghettos, there are no areas where this has happened, there are no... When he knows full well what's going on, what's wrong with them?
[02:26:04.449 --> 02:26:08.132]  And can you speak to the weird merger of the left with this?
[02:26:08.132 --> 02:26:12.094]  Because they hate the average Western male even wearing pants.
[02:26:12.094 --> 02:26:17.258]  They want to destroy it, but they love headdresses, mutilation, enslavement.
[02:26:17.258 --> 02:26:19.760]  I mean, is it a death wish?
[02:26:20.865 --> 02:26:22.747]  I don't know if they do love it, I think they're using it.
[02:26:22.747 --> 02:26:30.353]  You have to remember, many of these hardcore left groups, Communists, Marxists, they hate the rule of law, they hate democracy.
[02:26:30.353 --> 02:26:31.974]  They'll side with anything to overthrow that.
[02:26:31.974 --> 02:26:32.274]  That's right.
[02:26:32.274 --> 02:26:34.916]  Probably the biggest option they have there is Islam.
[02:26:34.916 --> 02:26:37.619]  Because really, they hate religion too.
[02:26:37.619 --> 02:26:39.680]  So the biggest option they have is Islam.
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:42.643]  When we talk about why is it happening and how is it being facilitated and happening,
[02:26:43.263 --> 02:26:46.507]  Why are our government and why are our politicians and our political leaders being weak?
[02:26:46.507 --> 02:26:50.010]  Saudi Arabia own, I believe, over 40-50% of our stock market.
[02:26:50.010 --> 02:26:52.172]  They own every port in this country.
[02:26:52.172 --> 02:26:58.138]  They own majority shares in many of the banks, many of the supermarkets, many of the shopping centres.
[02:26:58.138 --> 02:26:58.819]  They've bought their way.
[02:26:58.819 --> 02:26:59.200]  Simple.
[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:01.542]  They've bought their way through our country.
[02:27:01.542 --> 02:27:04.385]  Our politicians, our political leaders, our governments have sold their soul to the devil.
[02:27:05.881 --> 02:27:08.623]  And we're left to pick up the pieces, living on the streets.
[02:27:08.623 --> 02:27:10.324]  And that's the reality of it.
[02:27:10.324 --> 02:27:13.026]  Let's face it, Boris Johnson doesn't live where we live.
[02:27:13.026 --> 02:27:17.570]  His children don't go to school as a minority in the towns that our children will.
[02:27:17.570 --> 02:27:21.073]  What's okay for him, we have to live with it.
[02:27:21.073 --> 02:27:22.094]  That's the reality of it.
[02:27:22.094 --> 02:27:28.799]  So whilst he's going to sit there and say how nice and cosy it is, he's not the one on the end of genuine hostility just simply for being a white Englishman or a non-Muslim.
[02:27:29.349 --> 02:27:31.151]  That's the reality of it.
[02:27:31.151 --> 02:27:39.898]  In my hometown, I just speak again, I don't speak about what I've read, what I've studied, which so many of these people on the left do.
[02:27:39.898 --> 02:27:42.861]  We've gone to university, we've got a degree and we've read this.
[02:27:42.861 --> 02:27:44.442]  Well, you haven't lived it, mate.
[02:27:44.442 --> 02:27:47.745]  I mean, you can't read a book on building a house and then build it.
[02:27:47.745 --> 02:27:51.088]  You have no experience at all in what we're talking about.
[02:27:51.088 --> 02:27:55.392]  You find in complete working class communities like where we're from, there's no left.
[02:27:55.919 --> 02:27:59.341]  There's no left-wing group like this.
[02:27:59.341 --> 02:28:00.582]  We all understand the problem.
[02:28:00.582 --> 02:28:14.492]  All of these people are living off their dad's money, many of the times, their mum and dad's money, and interest funds, and they're siding, and it's like Winston Churchill said, the fascists of the future will come under the banner of anti-fascists, and he was so right.
[02:28:14.492 --> 02:28:15.993]  He was so right in many things he said.
[02:28:15.993 --> 02:28:20.756]  He also said many great statements about Islam and about Muslims, and all of them have come into fruition.
[02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:24.922]  We should go over some of those quotes a little bit later.
[02:28:24.922 --> 02:28:29.384]  Continuing with the game plan, it seems people are waking up big time now.
[02:28:29.384 --> 02:28:36.109]  How will the controlled left and the Islamic-funded Saudi Arabian invasion respond to that?
[02:28:36.109 --> 02:28:36.689]  What's happening?
[02:28:36.689 --> 02:28:37.850]  I've been saying it for six years.
[02:28:37.850 --> 02:28:39.131]  There's a swing from left to right.
[02:28:39.131 --> 02:28:39.591]  It's happening.
[02:28:39.591 --> 02:28:40.491]  It's underway.
[02:28:40.491 --> 02:28:41.472]  There's no left-wing group.
[02:28:41.472 --> 02:28:42.553]  There's no political leaders.
[02:28:42.553 --> 02:28:43.193]  There's no police.
[02:28:43.193 --> 02:28:45.454]  There's no one that's going to stop it.
[02:28:45.454 --> 02:28:46.115]  It's happening.
[02:28:46.115 --> 02:28:47.616]  We tried with the English Defence League.
[02:28:47.616 --> 02:28:50.918]  We were the first people to take to the streets in our thousands.
[02:28:52.235 --> 02:28:53.436]  And then we went into Europe.
[02:28:53.436 --> 02:28:55.958]  We tried to branch into Europe and we were unsuccessful.
[02:28:55.958 --> 02:28:57.199]  Europe wasn't ready.
[02:28:57.199 --> 02:29:01.042]  I've recently just come back from Germany, 40,000 people.
[02:29:01.042 --> 02:29:10.630]  I went to the rally in the Czech Republic where the President turned up and spoke at the rally and he gave a clear statement about the mainstream media in the West.
[02:29:10.630 --> 02:29:13.092]  He gave a clear statement about the influence of Saudi.
[02:29:13.092 --> 02:29:20.238]  He gave a clear statement that he's not against foreigners because there's half a million foreigners in his country but he is against an ideology and a culture.
[02:29:20.498 --> 02:29:22.499]  That we will not respect his country.
[02:29:22.499 --> 02:29:25.080]  So, things are moving fast.
[02:29:25.080 --> 02:29:30.023]  On the 6th of February, we've organized a demonstration that's going to happen across Europe.
[02:29:30.023 --> 02:29:31.423]  As far away as Australia, actually.
[02:29:31.423 --> 02:29:32.904]  There's groups in Australia, hopefully.
[02:29:32.904 --> 02:29:35.666]  I'd love there to be a group in America that would join us on the 6th of February.
[02:29:35.666 --> 02:29:38.667]  But we're all going to be marching under a banner.
[02:29:38.667 --> 02:29:41.148]  Save our culture, save our country, save our future.
[02:29:41.148 --> 02:29:42.849]  It's something that all the groups can sign up to.
[02:29:42.849 --> 02:29:43.950]  We've got groups in France.
[02:29:43.950 --> 02:29:44.930]  Tommy Robinson, stay there.
[02:29:44.930 --> 02:29:46.391]  Tell us more about it straight ahead.
[02:29:46.391 --> 02:29:48.192]  And Paul Watson, we'll have questions as well.
[02:29:49.318 --> 02:29:53.249]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.249 --> 02:29:55.936]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.316 --> 02:30:02.998]  Another GOP debate is upon us.
[02:30:02.998 --> 02:30:09.082]  A time to see how much attention will be allotted to establishment candidates who are dragging in the polls.
[02:30:09.082 --> 02:30:10.723]  These are Republican governors.
[02:30:10.723 --> 02:30:13.285]  They don't give any credit to the free market.
[02:30:13.285 --> 02:30:15.806]  They don't give any credit to the entrepreneur.
[02:30:15.806 --> 02:30:17.568]  All is not lost, though.
[02:30:17.568 --> 02:30:19.729]  Some are speaking on real issues.
[02:30:19.729 --> 02:30:25.273]  But if you're not going to respond to the no-fly zone strategy, what would yours be?
[02:30:25.273 --> 02:30:28.635]  The first thing I would do is I wouldn't arm our enemies.
[02:30:28.635 --> 02:30:29.636]  I wouldn't arm ISIS.
[02:30:30.396 --> 02:30:31.416]  Yes.
[02:30:31.416 --> 02:30:34.717]  Will controversial statements impact some of the candidates?
[02:30:34.717 --> 02:30:48.402]  Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
[02:30:49.242 --> 02:30:53.766]  Join InfoWars this Tuesday, December 15th, starting at 7 p.m.
[02:30:53.766 --> 02:30:58.850]  Central for another episode of Political Science Theater 3K.
[02:30:58.850 --> 02:31:02.053]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[02:31:02.053 --> 02:31:03.815]  Deep cleanse by InfoWarsLife.com
[02:31:04.395 --> 02:31:11.422]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[02:31:11.422 --> 02:31:16.746]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[02:31:16.746 --> 02:31:25.715]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[02:31:26.155 --> 02:31:35.042]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[02:31:35.042 --> 02:31:42.127]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary SpiteGerex herbal processing technique.
[02:31:42.127 --> 02:31:47.591]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs, backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best price.

[02:32:01.927 --> 02:32:11.650]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:32:11.650 --> 02:32:14.350]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:32:14.350 --> 02:32:17.911]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:32:17.911 --> 02:32:24.233]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[02:32:24.233 --> 02:32:26.754]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[02:32:26.954 --> 02:32:29.376]  And then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:32:29.376 --> 02:32:35.741]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[02:32:35.741 --> 02:32:43.486]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[02:32:43.486 --> 02:32:51.032]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[02:32:51.032 --> 02:32:54.635]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:54.635 --> 02:32:56.336]  That's ChildEase exclusively.
[02:33:02.163 --> 02:33:09.914]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:24.397 --> 02:33:26.258]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:33:26.258 --> 02:33:27.118]  to 3 p.m.
[02:33:27.118 --> 02:33:28.099]  Central Standard Time.
[02:33:28.099 --> 02:33:29.239]  We're here.
[02:33:29.239 --> 02:33:34.482]  Paul Watson from London, who's on with us right now, will be hosting the fourth hour.
[02:33:34.482 --> 02:33:43.827]  Also, we're going to air a special report dealing with how the Democrats control the Republican Party by infiltrating the delegate level, working with neocons, and are admittedly planning
[02:33:44.952 --> 02:33:52.516]  To sabotage a candidate like Donald Trump in the electoral process down at the state level with the delegates.
[02:33:52.516 --> 02:34:02.142]  So that special report will be airing, it's about 10 minutes long, when Paul Watson hosts the next hour at the bottom of the hour, or maybe even earlier.
[02:34:02.142 --> 02:34:06.384]  Bill Cosby, just the last hour, has sued accusers.
[02:34:06.384 --> 02:34:08.926]  He said, you assassinated my character.
[02:34:10.765 --> 02:34:20.489]  Now, I'm not defending Bill Cosby, but Bill Clinton settled at least three things out of court for women that claimed he raped them, and I mean brutally.
[02:34:20.489 --> 02:34:25.150]  And these were in cases where he'd be a cloakroom at a party, or at a government facility.
[02:34:25.150 --> 02:34:26.911]  He'd say, please speak to me for a moment.
[02:34:26.911 --> 02:34:33.013]  He'd take them into a room next to a party, grab them around the throat, bite their lip to hold them.
[02:34:33.013 --> 02:34:37.035]  I mean, we're talking sometimes bleeding, is what they allege, and he settled that.
[02:34:38.837 --> 02:34:40.038]  Cosby hasn't.
[02:34:40.038 --> 02:34:50.525]  And I would see these women and they'd be like, yes, I worked at the Playboy facility and, you know, I went to parties with him, you know, 20-something times and, you know, I think he would drug me when we had sex.
[02:34:50.525 --> 02:34:51.386]  I don't remember it.
[02:34:51.386 --> 02:34:56.750]  I mean, you go up to a hotel room, you think he drugged you.
[02:34:56.750 --> 02:35:00.893]  This is in the 60s and 70s.
[02:35:00.893 --> 02:35:02.154]  You go to a hotel room,
[02:35:03.171 --> 02:35:04.912]  It's like Colby Bryant people.
[02:35:04.912 --> 02:35:06.152]  Turned out he didn't do all that.
[02:35:06.152 --> 02:35:13.694]  I mean, it's not smart if you're a celebrity, period, or whatever, to just go up to some random woman to a hotel room, but then they go out with him repeatedly?
[02:35:13.694 --> 02:35:24.398]  In many of these cases, these are women, in my view, that may have been abused at some level, they may have been taken advantage of, but can you say it's rape?
[02:35:25.649 --> 02:35:27.931]  Under this new feminist definition?
[02:35:27.931 --> 02:35:35.218]  Where, oh, I didn't want to have sex with you today, I mean, I did yesterday, but I was drinking, so it's rape.
[02:35:35.218 --> 02:35:42.985]  And the police will tell you, and it's come out in criminology now, that upwards of half or more of rape claims get reversed later and are fake.
[02:35:42.985 --> 02:35:46.007]  Once it gets down to brass tacks, they go, okay, I was mad at him, I just said it.
[02:35:46.007 --> 02:35:49.491]  And women need to know, this isn't just something you throw out there.
[02:35:49.491 --> 02:35:50.932]  Like, you raped me.
[02:35:53.757 --> 02:35:54.598]  It's despicable.
[02:35:54.598 --> 02:35:57.160]  There is real rape going on and it is a problem.
[02:35:57.160 --> 02:36:01.323]  And let me tell you where, statistically, it's culturally accepted.
[02:36:01.323 --> 02:36:01.944]  And it's a fact.
[02:36:03.652 --> 02:36:13.034]  It is culturally accepted in the Middle East to a great extent that if a woman isn't accompanied by other men and their face isn't covered, they are fair game to be raped.
[02:36:13.034 --> 02:36:14.454]  Period.
[02:36:14.454 --> 02:36:18.635]  And you bring millions of people to Germany alone who have that culture.
[02:36:18.635 --> 02:36:20.916]  Because a lot of Muslim cultures aren't that extreme.
[02:36:20.916 --> 02:36:25.557]  And man, they see some hot women walking along at midnight out of a bar in short skirts.
[02:36:26.457 --> 02:36:29.359]  They're telling Germans nationwide, do not wear short skirts.
[02:36:29.359 --> 02:36:30.640]  You know, do not have Christmas carols.
[02:36:30.640 --> 02:36:31.581]  It may upset the Muslims.
[02:36:31.581 --> 02:36:33.382]  And the Muslims are saying, take it down.
[02:36:33.382 --> 02:36:38.906]  So in political correctness with these invading groups, they have been turbocharged with their arrogance.
[02:36:38.906 --> 02:36:52.016]  And going back to the founder of the English Defense League, Tommy Robinson and Watson, recommending we get on, this is a guy, whether you love him or you hate him, who's been arrested many times and imprisoned.
[02:36:52.016 --> 02:36:55.379]  I mean, here's the shot of him trying to go to a Draw Muhammad cartoon deal.
[02:36:56.830 --> 02:36:58.391]  And he was arrested.
[02:36:58.391 --> 02:37:00.611]  And that was in July of this year.
[02:37:00.611 --> 02:37:01.772]  I mean, this is not a joke.
[02:37:01.772 --> 02:37:06.993]  So I want him to talk about those stories, what he's been through, some of the things that have been happening to him.
[02:37:06.993 --> 02:37:09.314]  And we go back to him in just one moment.
[02:37:09.314 --> 02:37:11.955]  Paul Watson pop in anytime.
[02:37:11.955 --> 02:37:14.936]  Before I do that, though, Christmas is here.
[02:37:14.936 --> 02:37:15.956]  And I'm not politically correct.
[02:37:15.956 --> 02:37:16.597]  It's not a holiday.
[02:37:16.597 --> 02:37:16.977]  It's Christmas.
[02:37:17.817 --> 02:37:19.958]  And most people are adopting Christmas because it's fun.
[02:37:19.958 --> 02:37:21.198]  I mean, you know, whatever.
[02:37:21.198 --> 02:37:22.778]  Pretty lights, Christmas trees, whatever.
[02:37:22.778 --> 02:37:28.940]  It's really just European culture superimposed over Christ's birth date that wasn't December 25th, by the way, for anybody that knows.
[02:37:28.940 --> 02:37:31.100]  It's admitted it was totally different than that.
[02:37:31.100 --> 02:37:33.061]  But they're trying to override it right now.
[02:37:33.061 --> 02:37:35.021]  We call it Christmas because that's what it is.
[02:37:35.021 --> 02:37:38.042]  And for me, it is about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and having fun with your family.
[02:37:39.346 --> 02:37:42.727]  But regardless, it's a time to give the gift of good health and life.
[02:37:42.727 --> 02:38:08.552]  And if you get something like the Deep Cleanse Pack, 28% off right now, and we have free shipping until December 18th, Deep Cleanse, Living Defense, and Oxy-Powder, those three things together, one a parasite cleanse, harmful organism cleanse, another overall heavy metal deep body cleanse with zeolite and shilajit, and then the Oxy-Powder, you do a one week cleanse on this, over the top the results that I, my family, and many others have gotten.
[02:38:09.505 --> 02:38:12.807]  We have Deep Cleanse on sale by itself, 17% off for free shipping.
[02:38:12.807 --> 02:38:17.349]  Winter Sun Vitamin D concentrate, organic, under the tongue.
[02:38:17.349 --> 02:38:18.730]  That's 15% off.
[02:38:18.730 --> 02:38:21.351]  And we've got free coffee cups when you get bags of coffee.
[02:38:21.351 --> 02:38:21.991]  So much more.
[02:38:21.991 --> 02:38:28.275]  It is your purchases that funds this entire media operation that reaches over 20 million people a week.
[02:38:28.275 --> 02:38:30.436]  And it's having a big major effect.
[02:38:30.436 --> 02:38:32.217]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:38:32.217 --> 02:38:34.438]  But you're getting really good, high quality products.
[02:38:35.955 --> 02:38:38.462]  At the same time, and then you can get your Christmas gifts.
[02:38:38.462 --> 02:38:42.193]  And in fact, we can deliver it to you before Christmas if you order by the 18th, on or before.
[02:38:43.865 --> 02:38:50.430]  But, you can also, if you don't want to get it delivered to you and then to somebody else, you can put in the address of where you want it delivered.
[02:38:50.430 --> 02:39:01.479]  You can fill out a little message in the note there, as a Christmas card, and then you can mail, whether it's coffee, or whether it's coffee cups, or whether it's a Hillary for Prison shirts that we stopped selling at Christmas.
[02:39:01.479 --> 02:39:02.620]  We'll stop selling them.
[02:39:02.620 --> 02:39:03.481]  We've stopped ordering them.
[02:39:03.481 --> 02:39:05.583]  It's already selling out in some sizes.
[02:39:05.583 --> 02:39:09.065]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888.
[02:39:11.107 --> 02:39:14.229]  Two-five-three, three-one, three-nine.
[02:39:29.207 --> 02:39:29.467]  I think so.
[02:39:50.586 --> 02:39:53.247]  Sweden, places like that.
[02:39:53.247 --> 02:39:59.708]  So again, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or PrisonPlanet.tv, and you can get all your Christmas shopping done.
[02:39:59.708 --> 02:40:10.751]  Okay, Paul Watson and Tommy Robinson, TommyRobinson.co.uk, former founder of the English Defense League, gets arrested routinely for just mild political speech.
[02:40:10.751 --> 02:40:12.411]  He's got the new book out, Enemy of the State.
[02:40:12.791 --> 02:40:13.692]  That everybody should read.
[02:40:13.692 --> 02:40:25.601]  Okay, I'm going to stop right there and give you the floor now to talk about what you've been through, what you've witnessed, the true tyranny, not just of the radical jihad, but the left and others, the statists, the globalists, want to balkanize society.
[02:40:25.601 --> 02:40:38.671]  What you've gone through, where you see this is going, and is the arrogance of the left and the arrogance of the jihadists what will finally be their undoing when their Imams from London to DC say, your women are ours, you are weak, we will conquer you.
[02:40:40.905 --> 02:40:49.469]  I think the biggest shock to me, when I started this, due to my experience in 2004, when this started in 2009, I knew full well I'd face death threats.
[02:40:49.469 --> 02:40:51.410]  I knew I'd get violently attacked.
[02:40:51.410 --> 02:40:52.590]  I knew Muslims would want to kill me.
[02:40:52.590 --> 02:40:54.211]  I knew full well that.
[02:40:54.211 --> 02:40:59.093]  What I was not prepared for, at all, was the state.
[02:40:59.093 --> 02:41:03.415]  The state shut down the pressure, the harassment, the persecution.
[02:41:03.415 --> 02:41:05.716]  When it didn't work on me, they turned to my family.
[02:41:05.716 --> 02:41:08.718]  If I just briefly explain, we'd started these protests in 2009.
[02:41:10.231 --> 02:41:13.833]  And obviously we're talking about sexual grooming, the rape of our young girls.
[02:41:13.833 --> 02:41:19.095]  Now there was one police force in particular, there's been a deep held report in Rotherham, which is South Yorkshire Police Force.
[02:41:20.706 --> 02:41:22.707]  They've been suppressing this for 20 years.
[02:41:22.707 --> 02:41:24.368]  Now, I've gone to Luton Airport.
[02:41:24.368 --> 02:41:25.409]  I'm arrested at Luton Airport.
[02:41:25.409 --> 02:41:27.891]  I was due to fly to Scotland to meet up with the Scottish Defence League.
[02:41:27.891 --> 02:41:31.613]  This is all just in the first six to nine months of starting the organisation.
[02:41:31.613 --> 02:41:32.493]  I've gone to Luton Airport.
[02:41:32.493 --> 02:41:33.914]  I've been arrested by Special Branch.
[02:41:33.914 --> 02:41:35.075]  They've took me to the police station.
[02:41:35.075 --> 02:41:36.896]  They've done simultaneous raids.
[02:41:36.896 --> 02:41:41.519]  They've raided my mum's house, where my mum and dad live, and they've raided my house, where my wife and children live.
[02:41:41.519 --> 02:41:43.760]  When they've gone to my house, they've sent armed police.
[02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:44.701]  They've shut the whole road off.
[02:41:45.182 --> 02:41:46.943]  They spent six to eight hours in each house.
[02:41:46.943 --> 02:41:51.165]  They took my mum and dad's computers, they took all the phones, all the electrical devices.
[02:41:51.165 --> 02:41:55.687]  When I got into interview they said I was arrested and it was South Yorkshire Police.
[02:41:55.687 --> 02:42:00.209]  I was due to be talking at a demonstration there and obviously I was going to be highlighting their failures in sexual grooming.
[02:42:01.110 --> 02:42:07.336]  So their tactic was to come down, kick my doors off prior to the demonstration, impose bail conditions.
[02:42:07.336 --> 02:42:09.018]  I was arrested on a criminal damage.
[02:42:09.018 --> 02:42:16.646]  What they actually said in interview was that on a hotel room door you've got the connecting bit which was broken and I was staying in the hotel.
[02:42:16.646 --> 02:42:17.566]  Now that cost £30.
[02:42:17.566 --> 02:42:21.731]  They had at least 20 police officers who ransacked both our houses.
[02:42:22.191 --> 02:42:28.316]  I was then given bail conditions for this criminal damage, not to associate or contact with three or more English Defence League supporters.
[02:42:28.316 --> 02:42:33.300]  The bail date I was given was to coincide with the date of our demonstration.
[02:42:33.300 --> 02:42:35.161]  After three weeks, all charges were dropped.
[02:42:35.161 --> 02:42:47.231]  I put in a complaint through the IPCC, which is the Independent Police Complaints Commission, and it turns out that they actually had a statement from the manager of the hotel who said I had nothing to do with the criminal damage.
[02:42:47.231 --> 02:42:48.932]  So they had completely fabricated
[02:42:49.812 --> 02:42:55.877]  ...to get warrants to come and basically intimidate, intimidate me into silence and persecute my family.
[02:42:55.877 --> 02:42:58.058]  Now, and three, they dropped all charges.
[02:42:58.058 --> 02:43:00.740]  Now, three months after this, I've got that in black and white.
[02:43:00.740 --> 02:43:01.560]  I've got that in black and white.
[02:43:01.560 --> 02:43:02.961]  Now, we know this is politically directed.
[02:43:02.961 --> 02:43:12.448]  We know it's, this has all been on the UK news, everything you're saying in your newsletter is on record, but did any of the police at the low level ever quietly apologize to you?
[02:43:12.448 --> 02:43:14.089]  Because I know that this is from higher up.
[02:43:15.342 --> 02:43:16.022]  So many times.
[02:43:16.022 --> 02:43:16.542]  Do you know what?
[02:43:16.542 --> 02:43:18.403]  Do you know when they come in my house?
[02:43:18.403 --> 02:43:20.203]  After that, they come back three months later.
[02:43:20.203 --> 02:43:30.025]  Now, the knock-on effect on my wife, who's living in our house and the neighbours and everything like that, the pressure it brought, it was a plan what they were doing.
[02:43:30.025 --> 02:43:31.325]  And that was to intimidate me.
[02:43:31.325 --> 02:43:35.826]  When that failed, they come back three months later and they come through the door again.
[02:43:35.826 --> 02:43:39.087]  They arrested me and they arrested my wife who was six months pregnant.
[02:43:39.087 --> 02:43:42.988]  And as they arrested my wife, it was a Luton police officer and he just said, he said, I'm so sorry.
[02:43:43.874 --> 02:43:45.255]  I said, what?
[02:43:45.255 --> 02:43:46.416]  He goes, we're taking your wife.
[02:43:46.416 --> 02:43:47.657]  I said, what do you mean you're taking my wife?
[02:43:47.657 --> 02:43:48.458]  She's six months pregnant.
[02:43:48.458 --> 02:43:49.939]  What are you taking my wife for?
[02:43:49.939 --> 02:43:52.161]  And they arrested her on tax evasion.
[02:43:52.161 --> 02:43:56.364]  They held her on bail for over three years, having to repeatedly go back.
[02:43:56.364 --> 02:44:00.788]  And in the end, three years later, they used her security and stability and safety of her and my family.
[02:44:01.377 --> 02:44:06.261]  Um, to blackmail me, to blackmail me into, um, pleading guilty to an offence.
[02:44:06.261 --> 02:44:11.865]  And some people, I don't really think, as I said, it won't do it justice explaining it now, but I can go through some of the situations.
[02:44:11.865 --> 02:44:15.768]  Yeah, you don't know until they've got your pregnant wife in jail and say, sign this or we're not letting her out.
[02:44:15.768 --> 02:44:17.389]  You don't know the pressure that puts.
[02:44:17.389 --> 02:44:18.751]  Pure evil.
[02:44:18.751 --> 02:44:23.074]  Well, and I just, I still can't believe that they've done it so blatantly.
[02:44:23.729 --> 02:44:35.018]  I can't believe that, what you spoke about earlier, I was on a charity walk, and I was doing a charity walk, and the Muslim leaders had said that basically we weren't allowed to enter into the borough of Tower Hamlets, which is a huge, the biggest borough of London.
[02:44:35.018 --> 02:44:38.721]  We weren't allowed to walk through there on our charity walk.
[02:44:38.721 --> 02:44:48.869]  The police arrested us, and what they did is, if anyone can watch this, put in Tommy Robinson charity walk on YouTube, you'll see, which is definitely two undercover police officers, they come in and they attack us.
[02:44:48.869 --> 02:44:50.210]  And then the police let them walk off.
[02:44:52.389 --> 02:44:52.949]  Here's the police.
[02:44:52.949 --> 02:44:53.670]  The police are at my house.
[02:44:53.670 --> 02:44:54.070]  One second.
[02:44:54.070 --> 02:44:57.111]  I'll just walk them out there.
[02:44:57.111 --> 02:44:58.092]  I'd be dead by now, wouldn't I?
[02:44:58.092 --> 02:44:59.152]  As lucky as a panicked man.
[02:44:59.152 --> 02:45:04.334]  Yeah, he's got the radical Muslims at his house almost every day.
[02:45:04.334 --> 02:45:05.535]  I'm not that knowledgeable, did I?
[02:45:05.535 --> 02:45:06.015]  Nah, sorry.
[02:45:06.015 --> 02:45:09.637]  I was just... I'll just put the picture down and it's hit the button.
[02:45:09.637 --> 02:45:10.477]  It's not a problem, I told you.
[02:45:10.477 --> 02:45:11.858]  Yeah, you can have a look.
[02:45:11.858 --> 02:45:12.618]  No, I'm not under duress.
[02:45:12.618 --> 02:45:13.098]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:45:13.098 --> 02:45:13.238]  Yeah.
[02:45:13.238 --> 02:45:13.839]  Nah, it's alright.
[02:45:20.209 --> 02:45:25.113]  That's a picture of my wife and kids because I'm doing something online.
[02:45:25.113 --> 02:45:26.534]  I've knocked that down and it's hit.
[02:45:26.534 --> 02:45:27.295]  Thanks a lot for coming out.
[02:45:32.355 --> 02:45:33.356]  Oh no, I'd be dead by now, lads.
[02:45:33.356 --> 02:45:34.376]  That's about literally 40 minutes.
[02:45:34.376 --> 02:45:35.457]  We've just come from Roxton.
[02:45:35.457 --> 02:45:37.999]  We've come from the other side of the black cat roundabout down here.
[02:45:37.999 --> 02:45:41.121]  It's absolutely mental to have to use the traffic police officers.
[02:45:41.121 --> 02:45:43.983]  I think last time when she pressed it was 22 minutes.
[02:45:43.983 --> 02:45:44.504]  Yeah.
[02:45:44.504 --> 02:45:46.845]  The thing is, I think just now you couldn't be any further away.
[02:45:46.845 --> 02:45:49.987]  You're really in that isolated bit where you're... Yeah, don't say where we are.
[02:45:49.987 --> 02:45:50.768]  He's got a panic button.
[02:45:50.768 --> 02:45:52.529]  He actually had it during the interview.
[02:45:52.529 --> 02:45:52.950]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:45:52.950 --> 02:45:54.070]  Alright, thanks a lot.
[02:45:54.070 --> 02:45:55.391]  Thanks for coming officers, yeah.
[02:45:55.391 --> 02:45:55.992]  No worries, thanks.
[02:45:55.992 --> 02:45:58.514]  Thank you, sorry.
[02:45:58.514 --> 02:45:59.494]  I'd be dead now, wouldn't I?
[02:45:59.494 --> 02:46:00.655]  That's meant to be a panic button.
[02:46:00.655 --> 02:46:01.315]  That's meant to...
[02:46:02.657 --> 02:46:05.438]  You know, last time this happened, my wife... You're not allowed to have guns in the country, I know.
[02:46:05.438 --> 02:46:06.499]  That's terrible.
[02:46:06.499 --> 02:46:06.739]  I'm not.
[02:46:06.739 --> 02:46:07.699]  You're just not allowed to have guns.
[02:46:07.699 --> 02:46:11.401]  You're not allowed to have anything.
[02:46:11.401 --> 02:46:12.541]  Look, that took an hour.
[02:46:12.541 --> 02:46:14.262]  That took 45 minutes.
[02:46:14.262 --> 02:46:15.422]  I'd be dead, wouldn't I?
[02:46:15.422 --> 02:46:15.762]  That's right.
[02:46:15.762 --> 02:46:18.464]  You hit that on accident right before the interview started.
[02:46:18.464 --> 02:46:19.484]  My head would be off.
[02:46:19.484 --> 02:46:20.064]  My head would be off.
[02:46:22.978 --> 02:46:27.240]  Well, shouldn't you culturally let them chop your head off just to get rid of your white guilt?
[02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:29.081]  I mean, wouldn't that be the right thing to do?
[02:46:29.081 --> 02:46:31.462]  Maybe then I wouldn't be a racist, then, would I?
[02:46:31.462 --> 02:46:32.082]  Absolutely.
[02:46:32.082 --> 02:46:35.164]  A dead Tommy would be a good Tommy, according to some people.
[02:46:35.164 --> 02:46:37.125]  So, I mean, I agree.
[02:46:37.125 --> 02:46:37.725]  We don't want you dead.
[02:46:37.725 --> 02:46:40.686]  So expanding on this, you say the pendulum has swung.
[02:46:40.686 --> 02:46:41.927]  I want to get into that.
[02:46:41.927 --> 02:46:43.968]  I want Paul to ask some questions as well.
[02:46:43.968 --> 02:46:50.411]  But continuing with all the persecution, you were getting into how they allowed folks to attack you on the charity walk.
[02:46:50.411 --> 02:46:52.052]  And we'll show some of that on screen right now.
[02:46:53.291 --> 02:46:57.814]  Yeah, if you actually show... So basically, we're doing a charity walk for a young, dying girl.
[02:46:57.814 --> 02:47:00.756]  Now, Tower Hamlets is one of the boroughs which is a no-go zone.
[02:47:00.756 --> 02:47:01.256]  Yeah?
[02:47:01.256 --> 02:47:04.658]  So the Muslim leaders have come out and said that we're not allowed to enter that borough.
[02:47:04.658 --> 02:47:05.458]  And we're on a charity walk.
[02:47:05.458 --> 02:47:07.159]  We're going across London.
[02:47:07.159 --> 02:47:08.580]  Which takes us through Tower Hamlets.
[02:47:08.580 --> 02:47:13.643]  The police come to see me the night before and said, you're not allowed to walk in, or we don't want you to walk into Tower Hamlets.
[02:47:13.643 --> 02:47:16.825]  And I said, they wanted me to take a 16-mile detour.
[02:47:16.825 --> 02:47:17.446]  Or something like that.
[02:47:17.446 --> 02:47:18.186]  I've only got little legs.
[02:47:18.186 --> 02:47:20.427]  So I was like, look, it's my capital city.
[02:47:20.427 --> 02:47:21.848]  And I said, why can't I walk through Tower Hamlets?
[02:47:21.848 --> 02:47:22.929]  And they said, well, because there's mosques.
[02:47:23.706 --> 02:47:25.227]  I said, I live in Luton, there's 30 mosques.
[02:47:25.227 --> 02:47:25.907]  What are you talking about?
[02:47:25.907 --> 02:47:28.649]  I said, like, there's mosques all over this country.
[02:47:28.649 --> 02:47:29.370]  Everywhere.
[02:47:29.370 --> 02:47:32.212]  We've got over two and a half thousand mosques.
[02:47:32.212 --> 02:47:39.256]  So, when we've turned up to do the charity walk, as we're walking through, they've allowed two people to come into us and turn around and physically assault us.
[02:47:39.256 --> 02:47:41.037]  Now, once we've been physically assaulted, we don't react.
[02:47:41.037 --> 02:47:43.119]  We put our hands up, because we know what's happening anyway.
[02:47:43.119 --> 02:47:44.720]  We put our hands up and they allow these
[02:47:45.367 --> 02:47:48.589]  Police officers, who attacked us, who walk off.
[02:47:48.589 --> 02:47:50.549]  And they walk off and then we're arrested.
[02:47:50.549 --> 02:47:52.030]  And the police officer arrests me.
[02:47:52.030 --> 02:47:53.051]  And I said, what are you arresting me for?
[02:47:53.051 --> 02:47:53.911]  I haven't done anything.
[02:47:53.911 --> 02:47:55.472]  We've just been assaulted.
[02:47:55.472 --> 02:47:59.334]  She arrested us for preventing a police officer in her line of duty.
[02:47:59.334 --> 02:48:00.334]  They didn't just arrest us.
[02:48:00.334 --> 02:48:03.156]  What they did then was I was given bail conditions.
[02:48:03.156 --> 02:48:04.236]  I was charged.
[02:48:04.236 --> 02:48:09.859]  I was given bail conditions not to enter the borough of Tower Hamlets, which was enforcing exactly what the imam had told them to enforce.
[02:48:10.899 --> 02:48:14.101]  And this just hasn't, this has gone on and on and on.
[02:48:14.101 --> 02:48:15.482]  There's so many circumstances.
[02:48:15.482 --> 02:48:19.364]  And they put false charges on you on video under the orders of the Imam.
[02:48:20.319 --> 02:48:21.300]  False charges.
[02:48:21.300 --> 02:48:26.723]  False charges which were subsequently, four months later, once I went through court three times, they were kicked out.
[02:48:26.723 --> 02:48:37.009]  But that's not just... They've done so... Like, I thought everything they've done in the persecution was... When I finally left the English Defence League in 2013, I thought I'd given them what they wanted.
[02:48:37.009 --> 02:48:39.591]  They'd persecuted my family.
[02:48:39.591 --> 02:48:41.492]  They'd gone... I looked in their investigation.
[02:48:41.492 --> 02:48:44.614]  They'd gone and withdrawn warrants on my mum and dad's bank accounts.
[02:48:45.294 --> 02:48:58.025]  Um, they'd arrested my brother-in-law, my cousin, they'd gone and raided my nan's, they'd gone basically through every member of my family, they'd gone through every tax, which is the IRS in America, they'd gone through every single thing.
[02:48:58.025 --> 02:49:01.888]  Okay, total harassment and then still you're not allowed to even go out in public.
[02:49:01.888 --> 02:49:03.670]  They arrested you this year?
[02:49:03.670 --> 02:49:04.651]  They arrested me this year.
[02:49:04.651 --> 02:49:11.076]  So, I um, I subsequently after four years of being on conditions, I went to, I went on trial for what they said was tax evasion.
[02:49:11.076 --> 02:49:13.378]  They said I owed them a hundred and thirty... Sorry.
[02:49:15.351 --> 02:49:18.293]  Yes, we got your video back, go ahead.
[02:49:18.293 --> 02:49:20.294]  Yeah, they said I owed them £137,000 in tax.
[02:49:20.294 --> 02:49:22.035]  They'd completely fabricated it.
[02:49:22.035 --> 02:49:23.836]  And they held me on this charge for four years.
[02:49:23.836 --> 02:49:26.197]  They froze my assets, my businesses.
[02:49:26.197 --> 02:49:29.739]  When the inconsistencies started, I had a successful plumbing business employing six men.
[02:49:29.739 --> 02:49:32.720]  I had a sunbed solarium shop in the town centre.
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:33.961]  I was flying high.
[02:49:33.961 --> 02:49:34.981]  I had seven properties.
[02:49:34.981 --> 02:49:36.502]  I was working hard.
[02:49:36.502 --> 02:49:37.423]  They closed it all down.
[02:49:37.423 --> 02:49:41.905]  They held me under conditions which I believe the Labour government brought in probably for terrorists.
[02:49:41.905 --> 02:49:43.926]  They froze all my assets, with no crime.
[02:49:44.446 --> 02:49:47.187]  And they held me for three years, and subsequently I got knocked out.
[02:49:47.187 --> 02:49:58.629]  And now we know that Obama ordered them this week, or last week, to cover up that these people were Muslim or have been trained in jihad camps, and that they let her in with a fake visa information.
[02:49:58.629 --> 02:50:01.310]  They ordered the FBI to say it wasn't terrorism.
[02:50:01.310 --> 02:50:07.411]  They've banned hundreds of people entering the UK from the US who mildly criticize Islam.
[02:50:07.411 --> 02:50:10.372]  There is absolute submission and worship.
[02:50:10.372 --> 02:50:11.952]  I'm going to skip this network break, it's so important.
[02:50:12.612 --> 02:50:17.620]  Absolute worship by the UK government and by the Obama government of radical Muslims.
[02:50:17.620 --> 02:50:19.543]  Why do they worship them so much?
[02:50:19.543 --> 02:50:20.504]  Why are they above the law?
[02:50:21.619 --> 02:50:24.200]  It's the influence they have.
[02:50:24.200 --> 02:50:27.742]  You know, like, say for example, again I'll bring you back to my hometown.
[02:50:27.742 --> 02:50:30.203]  My hometown has 40,000 to 50,000 Muslims.
[02:50:30.203 --> 02:50:32.204]  The Labour Party get 40,000 votes.
[02:50:32.204 --> 02:50:33.565]  That keeps them in power.
[02:50:33.565 --> 02:50:36.847]  They do a deal with the central, and that's only when they're 4%.
[02:50:36.847 --> 02:50:38.628]  They're that powerful as a bloc vote.
[02:50:38.628 --> 02:50:39.948]  It's vote bank politics.
[02:50:39.948 --> 02:50:45.411]  They're that powerful that they do a deal with a local council of mosques who are all coordinated together through one leader,
[02:50:46.432 --> 02:50:47.873]  They've got the Labour vote.
[02:50:47.873 --> 02:50:49.935]  And quite frankly, we're irrelevant.
[02:50:49.935 --> 02:50:52.857]  We're irrelevant in the scheme of things.
[02:50:52.857 --> 02:51:00.304]  People in old liberal republics are just out having fun, working hard, don't really organise, watching football games.
[02:51:00.304 --> 02:51:05.208]  And folks from third world dictatorships, they organise, they're under control of just a few leaders.
[02:51:05.208 --> 02:51:07.771]  They all donate large parts of what they make to them.
[02:51:07.771 --> 02:51:08.391]  Money.
[02:51:08.391 --> 02:51:09.232]  And it's on.
[02:51:09.232 --> 02:51:09.833]  It's a takeover.
[02:51:10.546 --> 02:51:11.866]  It's a takeover.
[02:51:11.866 --> 02:51:13.387]  And no one can say it's nothing different.
[02:51:13.387 --> 02:51:16.087]  And what the worrying thing is, look, 4% of the country is Muslim.
[02:51:16.087 --> 02:51:18.808]  We really need to be thinking about what it's going to be like when it's 20%.
[02:51:18.808 --> 02:51:26.769]  And the biggest fear, or I had, even when I went into prison, they finally got me into prison on a mortgage fraud case, which was not my mortgage again.
[02:51:26.769 --> 02:51:28.829]  I had to plead guilty to someone else's case.
[02:51:28.829 --> 02:51:29.870]  I had to, unless I wasn't one of them.
[02:51:29.870 --> 02:51:30.590]  Believe me, I know.
[02:51:30.590 --> 02:51:34.470]  You can put one number wrong on a mortgage deal and they throw you in prison for it.
[02:51:34.470 --> 02:51:36.471]  You can bounce a check, they throw you in prison for it.
[02:51:36.471 --> 02:51:37.891]  We understand we followed your case.
[02:51:38.171 --> 02:51:40.192]  And we see the videos, you've done nothing, they arrest you.
[02:51:40.192 --> 02:51:43.955]  This year, you went to a draw Muhammad contest and got arrested.
[02:51:43.955 --> 02:51:47.797]  So I was due to be talking at, I had a meeting arranged at the House of Lords, yeah?
[02:51:47.797 --> 02:51:49.458]  And it was for the 23rd of July.
[02:51:49.458 --> 02:51:55.182]  Now, seven days before that, the police came with no justification, no reason.
[02:51:55.182 --> 02:51:57.003]  They took me straight into Peterborough Prison.
[02:51:57.003 --> 02:51:59.905]  Peterborough Prison is a prison where
[02:52:01.626 --> 02:52:03.788]  Every prison in this country, they're like ISIS training camps.
[02:52:03.788 --> 02:52:05.310]  They're full of radical Muslims.
[02:52:05.310 --> 02:52:07.212]  I explained to them straight away what was going to happen to me.
[02:52:07.212 --> 02:52:08.693]  I said, I'm going to get killed.
[02:52:08.693 --> 02:52:10.155]  These are all new teeth.
[02:52:10.155 --> 02:52:12.997]  I've had a blood clot removed on my head.
[02:52:12.997 --> 02:52:15.900]  When I was in prison the last time, they actually locked me in a room with them.
[02:52:15.900 --> 02:52:18.403]  I was locked in a room and left to get killed.
[02:52:18.403 --> 02:52:20.004]  I said, I was lucky to come out of there.
[02:52:20.004 --> 02:52:21.506]  And that's happened time and time again.
[02:52:21.506 --> 02:52:22.066]  I'm on the note.
[02:52:22.066 --> 02:52:23.287]  Describe what they did to you.
[02:52:23.287 --> 02:52:24.629]  I mean, did you give as good as you got?
[02:52:25.149 --> 02:52:25.549]  Yeah, I did.
[02:52:25.549 --> 02:52:26.969]  Yeah, of course.
[02:52:26.969 --> 02:52:28.350]  You have to.
[02:52:28.350 --> 02:52:33.491]  And even this last time, when I got called in for that last eight days, I then got further arrested.
[02:52:33.491 --> 02:52:35.911]  So when I've gone in, I've said to them, I'm going to get killed in here.
[02:52:35.911 --> 02:52:37.412]  You know I'm going to get killed.
[02:52:37.412 --> 02:52:44.813]  I've walked out on the wing the first day, and I've had a lad come up to me, and he's put his hand over his face, and he goes, you're going to get done with boiling water and sugar.
[02:52:44.813 --> 02:52:48.014]  Now that's where they put boiling water, they put sugar in, they throw it in your face.
[02:52:48.014 --> 02:52:49.514]  It'll take your whole face off.
[02:52:49.514 --> 02:52:51.054]  Well, they like to do that to women.
[02:52:51.054 --> 02:52:53.135]  That's another thing the feminists seem to get off on, yeah.
[02:52:53.135 --> 02:52:53.995]  They love that part.
[02:52:55.100 --> 02:53:01.763]  I've looked across, I've seen, I've said who's going to do it, they've pointed out, the lad said the Somalian, the lad behind the door's paying him.
[02:53:01.763 --> 02:53:06.825]  Remember, I'm in for eight days, these Muslim lads are in for 26 years for just killing two people.
[02:53:06.825 --> 02:53:08.626]  They have nothing to lose and they will kill me.
[02:53:09.119 --> 02:53:13.423]  So I've done the only thing I could do, which was pre-emptive strike.
[02:53:13.423 --> 02:53:14.845]  And then I've been put down to segregation.
[02:53:14.845 --> 02:53:19.349]  But my license conditions finished on the 22nd of July.
[02:53:19.349 --> 02:53:23.013]  So under no circumstances, I should have walked out of that prison on the 22nd of July.
[02:53:23.013 --> 02:53:25.255]  I had an event planned on the 23rd of July.
[02:53:25.875 --> 02:53:27.797]  22nd of July come, I'm still in prison.
[02:53:27.797 --> 02:53:30.138]  23rd of July come, I'm still in prison.
[02:53:30.138 --> 02:53:33.040]  They released me on the 24th of July once they'd known the date had gone.
[02:53:33.040 --> 02:53:40.485]  They purposely held me illegally, and the things that have gone on... I gotta say, your police are particularly cowardly and evil.
[02:53:40.485 --> 02:53:46.449]  We have a lot of bad feds here in this country, but most local departments would not engage in such evil against innocent people.
[02:53:46.449 --> 02:53:49.171]  And I saw them beating you up and arresting you for no reason in London.
[02:53:49.171 --> 02:53:50.392]  They looked like they were enjoying it.
[02:53:50.392 --> 02:53:51.913]  I didn't know they could pile crap that high.
[02:53:52.830 --> 02:54:00.678]  Yeah, again, I do have to say that every individual officer I've met, even when they've arrested me, are apologetic and seem very sympathetic to what we're saying.
[02:54:00.678 --> 02:54:04.802]  What about the ones that assaulted you?
[02:54:04.802 --> 02:54:07.044]  Yeah, that day, again, they're under orders.
[02:54:07.044 --> 02:54:08.245]  I know they're under orders.
[02:54:08.245 --> 02:54:11.429]  If somebody tells me to assault peaceful people, I'm not doing it if I was a cop.
[02:54:12.130 --> 02:54:13.671]  I know, yeah.
[02:54:13.671 --> 02:54:16.212]  I'm not either, but that's because I'm not a coward.
[02:54:16.212 --> 02:54:25.578]  But at the same time, I wonder how many times, even for example, the prosecutor, the prosecutor who prosecuted me in a completely fraudulent, completely trumped up case, that was his last prosecution.
[02:54:25.578 --> 02:54:27.859]  He got made up to a judge straight after that case.
[02:54:27.859 --> 02:54:29.480]  So there's handshakes, conspiracies.
[02:54:29.480 --> 02:54:30.120]  No, I don't know.
[02:54:31.603 --> 02:54:33.044]  I was approached when I was in prison.
[02:54:33.044 --> 02:54:38.125]  I was approached and asked when I got out of prison if I'd reunite the right.
[02:54:38.125 --> 02:54:44.768]  So, for them, for them, for a secretive unit... They wanted you to be an operative to go in and run the whole show?
[02:54:44.768 --> 02:54:46.068]  To run the whole show.
[02:54:46.068 --> 02:54:48.869]  It's a secretive unit called Met Intelligence Bureau.
[02:54:48.869 --> 02:54:52.090]  And I said, there's no way I'm doing it.
[02:54:52.090 --> 02:54:53.691]  When I get out of here, I told them my plans.
[02:54:53.691 --> 02:54:55.171]  I'm going back to work.
[02:54:55.171 --> 02:54:57.212]  They had my assets restrained for four years.
[02:54:57.212 --> 02:54:59.533]  I said, I'm selling my properties and I'm going back to work.
[02:54:59.953 --> 02:55:05.195]  Now, when I got out of custody, I'd been out six weeks, I was driving, and I got arrested.
[02:55:05.195 --> 02:55:10.256]  I got arrested by three cars, pulled in, I was held for 24 hours, I was interviewed on a burglary.
[02:55:10.256 --> 02:55:10.596]  Yeah?
[02:55:10.596 --> 02:55:11.897]  A burglary.
[02:55:11.897 --> 02:55:17.118]  Now, when I got home, my wife said, Winchester Prison's been on the phone, that's the prison that I've just come out of.
[02:55:17.118 --> 02:55:18.819]  She said, um, you've left some clothing there.
[02:55:18.819 --> 02:55:19.819]  So she gave me the number.
[02:55:19.819 --> 02:55:22.020]  It was a 0207 number, it was a London number.
[02:55:22.020 --> 02:55:22.880]  So it wasn't Winchester.
[02:55:23.712 --> 02:55:25.533]  I rang the number and it's Ollie.
[02:55:25.533 --> 02:55:27.615]  So I said, hi, it's Ollie from the MIB.
[02:55:27.615 --> 02:55:29.096]  We come and visited you in custody.
[02:55:29.096 --> 02:55:30.216]  I said, yeah.
[02:55:30.216 --> 02:55:32.418]  He said, we can help you out with the predicament you're in.
[02:55:32.418 --> 02:55:33.979]  I said, I'm not in a predicament.
[02:55:33.979 --> 02:55:34.819]  He said, yes, you are.
[02:55:34.819 --> 02:55:40.423]  He said, because if you get charged with this burglary, you'll do eight months on licence recall.
[02:55:40.423 --> 02:55:44.486]  Not just for you do eight months, but the whole country is going to be told you're a burglar.
[02:55:44.486 --> 02:55:47.548]  If you agree to sit down and have a chat with us, we can make that go away.
[02:55:48.223 --> 02:55:53.345]  And I'm sitting there, I've just come out of custody, I've left the English Defence League, and I don't know where to turn.
[02:55:53.345 --> 02:56:02.389]  And because I told them my plans of selling my properties... Yeah, you told them, I'm out of this, you told them, I'm done, and they're, no, no, you're going to work for us now.
[02:56:02.389 --> 02:56:03.129]  You're going to work for us.
[02:56:03.129 --> 02:56:05.550]  And because I refused, they put the burglary charge.
[02:56:05.550 --> 02:56:11.853]  When that failed, and I still said, well, I'm going to have to do the eight months, but facing eight months, for me going in prison, I'm lucky I've made it out.
[02:56:11.853 --> 02:56:12.633]  That's the truth.
[02:56:12.633 --> 02:56:13.773]  I'm lucky to have made it out.
[02:56:13.773 --> 02:56:14.694]  But you're not going to submit.
[02:56:15.393 --> 02:56:16.314]  I'm not going to submit.
[02:56:16.314 --> 02:56:20.980]  And then what's happened is I've got a letter through the post saying that they're taking £315,000 of me or I have to do five years in custody.
[02:56:25.265 --> 02:56:32.411]  And again, I get contacted by Met Intelligence Bureau, who say, if you agree to work with us, you don't have to pay the £315,000.
[02:56:32.411 --> 02:56:33.532]  I refuse it again.
[02:56:33.532 --> 02:56:35.413]  I tell them there's no chance.
[02:56:35.413 --> 02:56:36.794]  I go to court to fight the £315,000.
[02:56:36.794 --> 02:56:44.380]  The judge actually ruled, and this is all, as I said, this is all laid out in my book, the judge actually ruled that I have to pay the police £125,000.
[02:56:46.742 --> 02:56:49.064]  With no justification.
[02:56:49.064 --> 02:56:51.946]  Well, look, when all this gets deceited, you're going to be a hero.
[02:56:51.946 --> 02:56:53.427]  And it's just amazing.
[02:56:53.427 --> 02:56:54.808]  I had to sell my family house.
[02:56:54.808 --> 02:56:55.869]  They took my family home.
[02:56:55.869 --> 02:56:56.810]  Good God.
[02:56:56.810 --> 02:56:58.851]  You've gone forever, the persecution.
[02:56:58.851 --> 02:57:01.073]  The good news is, as you said, you've been vindicated.
[02:57:01.073 --> 02:57:04.496]  The government covering up the rape of all these little girls has been covered up.
[02:57:04.496 --> 02:57:06.757]  The rape gangs, they are in deep trouble now.
[02:57:06.757 --> 02:57:09.700]  Paul Watson, I want to bring you in here with a few comments.
[02:57:09.700 --> 02:57:11.701]  And we got five more minutes, then you're going to be hosting the show.
[02:57:11.701 --> 02:57:14.143]  And I'd like you to invite this fellow to continue to be liked.
[02:57:14.143 --> 02:57:15.004]  But Paul Watson, go ahead.
[02:57:16.496 --> 02:57:24.501]  Yeah, I mean, all this just underscores the fact that this stealth jihad, whatever you want to call it, cannot happen without the help of the state.
[02:57:24.501 --> 02:57:25.962]  And I mean, Tommy explained why.
[02:57:25.962 --> 02:57:29.964]  They bring in this group of immigrants who are dependent on government.
[02:57:29.964 --> 02:57:32.666]  They're more likely to vote for big government parties.
[02:57:32.666 --> 02:57:36.708]  So that's the incentive for the state to bring them in in the first place.
[02:57:36.708 --> 02:57:42.412]  And while they're going after people like Tommy, they're also going after, you know, for example, two years ago, there was a couple
[02:57:43.152 --> 02:57:53.379]  I think it was a Polish couple that had adopted a child and they supported UKIP, which is now a mainstream British political party that is anti-mass immigration.
[02:57:53.379 --> 02:58:03.145]  They had that child, despite the fact they had an exemplary record, just taken from them by the state simply for supporting this anti-immigration political party.
[02:58:03.145 --> 02:58:04.246]  But they still failed.
[02:58:04.246 --> 02:58:07.748]  UKIP's now the fastest growing in the UK and Europe.
[02:58:07.748 --> 02:58:12.892]  They can arrest Le Pen all they want, but it's just as Mr. Robinson said, the sleeping giant's awakening.
[02:58:13.992 --> 02:58:17.474]  Yeah, and then you've got, you know, you talked about Winston Churchill quotes earlier.
[02:58:17.474 --> 02:58:23.916]  Paul Weston, a politician, was arrested on the street for reading out Winston Churchill quotes about Islam.
[02:58:23.916 --> 02:58:28.778]  But people like Anjum Chowdhury are free to call for stoning homosexuals to death.
[02:58:28.778 --> 02:58:31.119]  They remain in the country unmolested for years and years.
[02:58:31.119 --> 02:58:34.881]  We're allowed to say, let's kill people, but you can't march.
[02:58:34.881 --> 02:58:36.782]  We'll be back in 70 seconds, fourth hour.
[02:58:36.782 --> 02:58:38.222]  Infowars.com forward slash show.

[02:59:52.319 --> 03:00:11.411]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.411 --> 03:00:14.013]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:14.013 --> 03:00:19.196]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:00:21.263 --> 03:00:23.065]  There is so much news we haven't gotten to yet.
[03:00:23.065 --> 03:00:28.171]  Paul Watson takes over in the next segment, but I also want him to get to some of the news.
[03:00:28.171 --> 03:00:30.053]  Why did the CIA meet with Michael Bay?
[03:00:30.053 --> 03:00:32.036]  That's from the Daily Beast.
[03:00:32.036 --> 03:00:33.437]  Just so much incredible news.
[03:00:34.736 --> 03:00:43.859]  Oil below $35 a barrel, 11-year lows on worsening glut, fear suicide rate soars in wake of crisis, climate obstacles emerge within hours.
[03:00:43.859 --> 03:00:49.921]  Yeah, they're now saying that Kerry says they can't get an agreement through because they can't get the countries to waive all their rights.
[03:00:49.921 --> 03:00:51.422]  So they're just going to have the U.S.
[03:00:51.422 --> 03:00:52.002]  and the U.K.
[03:00:52.002 --> 03:00:54.463]  and others selectively turn off our power.
[03:00:54.463 --> 03:00:56.103]  That's really what the deal always is.
[03:00:56.103 --> 03:01:00.605]  And India and China and everybody else doesn't have to.
[03:01:00.605 --> 03:01:01.525]  Simply amazing.
[03:01:02.932 --> 03:01:11.177]  That's just some of the news up on DrugsReport.com and InfoWars.com and InfoWars.com.
[03:01:11.177 --> 03:01:16.421]  We have the neoconservatives' hegemonic goal of making sovereign countries extinct.
[03:01:16.421 --> 03:01:21.284]  They openly announced this new goal instead of the extinction of the planet.
[03:01:22.662 --> 03:01:24.342]  And then we continue with other articles.
[03:01:24.342 --> 03:01:28.524]  ACL leader resigned after threatening mass murder of Trump supporters.
[03:01:28.524 --> 03:01:33.465]  They were actually defending him last week when he came out and said it, but now he's been forced to step down.
[03:01:33.465 --> 03:01:34.145]  We have video.
[03:01:34.145 --> 03:01:36.286]  Look what Muslim refugees left behind on the Autobahn.
[03:01:36.286 --> 03:01:41.747]  It literally looks for dozens of miles like a landfill has been put there.
[03:01:41.747 --> 03:01:43.127]  And there's the hatred they have.
[03:01:43.127 --> 03:01:44.808]  Screaming, yelling, trying to carjack.
[03:01:44.808 --> 03:01:46.668]  Screaming, Allah Akbar, we're going to get you.
[03:01:46.668 --> 03:01:48.249]  They've been taught to hate us.
[03:01:48.249 --> 03:01:49.149]  Then they're brought in.
[03:01:50.236 --> 03:01:55.670]  And then attached to socialism's milk facility, that's really our tax money.
[03:01:56.826 --> 03:01:58.607]  Tommy Robinson, where does all this end?
[03:01:58.607 --> 03:02:08.711]  You say you think the worm is turning, but I mean, when you see the hatred of the so-called left, you know, the Green Party heads in Germany saying, we want Germany to die.
[03:02:08.711 --> 03:02:09.711]  White people are bad.
[03:02:09.711 --> 03:02:10.771]  It's not, I'm not even racist.
[03:02:10.771 --> 03:02:11.992]  I'm not against other groups of people.
[03:02:11.992 --> 03:02:17.394]  I don't see other people acting like the leftist white people and then these weirdo radical Muslims.
[03:02:17.394 --> 03:02:19.755]  I mean, why do they want to destroy what's left of Europe?
[03:02:19.755 --> 03:02:21.135]  It's already collapsing.
[03:02:21.135 --> 03:02:25.557]  I mean, is it like a trophy they're going to mount on their wall that they destroy what their ancestors built?
[03:02:25.837 --> 03:02:26.637]  Is it a mental illness?
[03:02:26.637 --> 03:02:28.218]  Who are these freaks?
[03:02:28.218 --> 03:02:29.659]  They despise our history.
[03:02:29.659 --> 03:02:32.119]  They despise everything about us.
[03:02:32.119 --> 03:02:34.020]  White guilt is what Europe's suffering with.
[03:02:34.020 --> 03:02:35.161]  And it has been for a long time.
[03:02:35.161 --> 03:02:38.582]  Especially Angela Merkel.
[03:02:38.582 --> 03:02:41.143]  And the German generation of today have nothing to feel guilty about.
[03:02:41.143 --> 03:02:42.503]  They should be proud of the country they live in.
[03:02:42.503 --> 03:02:45.865]  They should be proud of the economy, the culture they have.
[03:02:45.865 --> 03:02:54.128]  The changing moment, I think, will be the first time we see a political leader elected, whether it be Marine Le Pen, whether it be Gert Wilders, who will try to enforce law.
[03:02:54.676 --> 03:02:58.839]  Because when they try to enforce law, by God, the Muslims will not allow them to.
[03:02:58.839 --> 03:03:00.160]  And that will be the moment.
[03:03:00.160 --> 03:03:03.103]  As soon as they try to enforce any sort of laws.
[03:03:03.103 --> 03:03:03.883]  You just said it.
[03:03:03.883 --> 03:03:07.887]  Every time they try to enforce, even arresting somebody for rape, they burn down half of Paris.
[03:03:07.887 --> 03:03:10.649]  That's, that, maybe it's intimidations while they're letting them do it.
[03:03:10.649 --> 03:03:13.531]  Maybe it's gone from, go ahead.
[03:03:13.531 --> 03:03:16.914]  Yeah, they are, now it's, they know what's going to happen.
[03:03:17.492 --> 03:03:21.915]  But for example, this country, in Britain, if they try to ban the burqa, Muslims will riot.
[03:03:21.915 --> 03:03:23.416]  They will not be able to ban the burqa.
[03:03:23.416 --> 03:03:24.977]  And that's such a small thing.
[03:03:24.977 --> 03:03:28.279]  And that's with a population of only three to four million.
[03:03:28.279 --> 03:03:30.820]  Now that population is growing, and growing very fast.
[03:03:30.820 --> 03:03:35.583]  And with this recent refugee crisis, we've seen over a million enter Germany this year.
[03:03:35.583 --> 03:03:40.446]  Well, when they're allowed to bring their families in the next 12 months, that'll be four or five million.
[03:03:40.446 --> 03:03:45.229]  Europe's heading one way, and it's exactly... we're heading to conflict, unfortunately.
[03:03:45.229 --> 03:03:47.150]  But that conflict has to happen when we can still win.
[03:03:47.714 --> 03:03:50.796]  And when we can still be triumphant, and we still have freedom.
[03:03:50.796 --> 03:03:57.119]  And I think what will happen is they'll wake a sleeping giant, and our love for freedom will always outweigh their love for Sharia.
[03:03:57.119 --> 03:04:01.522]  And people will come out, and they will, as is growing now, what you're seeing now is just a start.
[03:04:01.522 --> 03:04:02.122]  It's just a start.
[03:04:02.122 --> 03:04:04.283]  And this refugee crisis, that's just a trickle.
[03:04:04.283 --> 03:04:05.184]  The whirlwind's coming.
[03:04:05.184 --> 03:04:12.288]  Why are the radical Muslims, who are taking over Islam right now, by the way, and there are other countries that fight with each other constantly, why are they so arrogant?
[03:04:12.288 --> 03:04:14.689]  I mean, if I came from that type of suppression, I'd want to be in the West.
[03:04:15.350 --> 03:04:18.293]  Um, well, I spent 22 weeks in solitary confinement.
[03:04:18.293 --> 03:04:21.195]  When I spent 22 weeks in solitary confinement, I dissected the Qur'an.
[03:04:21.195 --> 03:04:23.757]  What I did is I opened up the Qur'an and I wrote reference.
[03:04:23.757 --> 03:04:27.340]  Everywhere it said you can't be friends with Jews or Christians, I logged it down.
[03:04:27.340 --> 03:04:30.283]  I also made references to when it says you can rape non-Muslim women.
[03:04:31.003 --> 03:04:32.264]  I made references to that.
[03:04:32.264 --> 03:04:37.906]  And I ended up with 14 references for where they're allowed to take non-Muslim women as sexual slaves.
[03:04:37.906 --> 03:04:43.808]  I ended up with pages of references of where they're told not to be friends with Jews or Christians.
[03:04:43.808 --> 03:04:52.151]  And when you're being brought up with that ideology, when you're being brought up with that stuff down your throat and told constantly how bad the disbelievers are, that would turn to hostility.
[03:04:52.151 --> 03:04:52.651]  Exactly.
[03:04:52.651 --> 03:04:53.131]  Stay there.
[03:04:53.131 --> 03:04:53.871]  One more segment.
[03:04:53.871 --> 03:04:57.212]  Tommy Robinson, Paul Watson takes over, both from England.
[03:04:57.212 --> 03:04:58.573]  Straight ahead in a bunch of other news.
[03:04:59.795 --> 03:05:03.820]  Despite all the statist rhetoric that gun control works, here's five reasons why it won't.
[03:05:03.820 --> 03:05:11.310]  Number one, California has many of the most restrictive gun laws in the country, yet those laws did absolutely nothing to stop the San Bernardino shooting.
[03:05:11.310 --> 03:05:18.219]  Number two, Paris, France also has some of the most restrictive gun laws in the world, but those laws also did nothing to stop the November 13th ISIS attacks.
[03:05:18.539 --> 03:05:25.143]  Number three, it's estimated that someone in Chicago is shot every 2.8 hours despite the city's strict gun laws.
[03:05:25.143 --> 03:05:32.648]  Number four, Mexico also has restrictive gun laws just like Chicago, yet over 160,000 people have been murdered in the country's drug war since 2007.
[03:05:33.809 --> 03:05:46.972]  The only people who are actually stopping the Mexican cartels are private citizens who are openly defying Mexico's gun laws to form self-defense militias.
[03:05:46.972 --> 03:05:55.933]  In fact, Obama approved the rearming of the so-called moderate rebels on October 1st, the same day he called for gun control in response to the community college shooting up in Oregon.

[03:07:54.014 --> 03:07:54.414]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:07:54.414 --> 03:07:55.934]  Do everything and don't care.
[03:08:21.034 --> 03:08:23.096]  We're back live.
[03:08:23.096 --> 03:08:25.018]  It's the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:25.018 --> 03:08:28.261]  I'm Paul Joseph Fox and I'll be with you for the next hour.
[03:08:28.261 --> 03:08:36.748]  We're talking to Tommy Robinson, author of Enemy of the State, about Islam, about radical Islam, about the refugee crisis.
[03:08:37.389 --> 03:08:39.311]  And again, let's get this clear.
[03:08:39.311 --> 03:08:42.133]  We're not just talking about the jihadist threat.
[03:08:42.133 --> 03:08:51.441]  Of course, the threat posed by Islam is not just coming from jihadists who will commit terror and violence to impose this on the West.
[03:08:51.441 --> 03:09:00.289]  It's coming from Islamists who will work through the political system, who will lean on government to impose this belief system.
[03:09:00.649 --> 03:09:20.302]  through Sharia law, which again is completely incompatible with the West, as has been proven by the Rotherham rape scandal, by numerous other paedophile scandals in the United Kingdom which were covered up because the police and the social services didn't want to appear politically incorrect.
[03:09:20.302 --> 03:09:30.449]  So it's not just the threat posed by, you know, ISIS members hiding amongst the refugees, it's the threat posed by Islamists who want to impose theocracy on the West.
[03:09:30.889 --> 03:09:44.200]  Which is bad news for secular democracy, it's bad news for women, it's bad news for minorities, and it's bad news for freedom of speech, for simply having the right to criticise a religion.
[03:09:44.200 --> 03:09:47.043]  But Tommy, something that Alex touched upon before the break,
[03:09:48.052 --> 03:09:57.299]  We've got, again, in the UK, Muslim immigration has only increased under the Conservative government, which supposedly was put in power to stem it.
[03:09:57.299 --> 03:10:17.575]  But why do thousands upon thousands of Muslims move to European countries, you know, presumably to escape conditions in their own countries, to escape that low quality of life, only to recreate those conditions by moving into these Muslim ghettos and refusing to integrate?
[03:10:17.995 --> 03:10:19.596]  That really doesn't make much sense to me.
[03:10:19.596 --> 03:10:21.458]  Does it make much sense to you?
[03:10:21.458 --> 03:10:27.963]  It doesn't, but if you look at certain research in those countries like Pew, the statistics of the way these people think.
[03:10:27.963 --> 03:10:33.588]  If you look at Pakistan where 86% of them believe being an apostate should be punishable by death.
[03:10:33.588 --> 03:10:36.090]  You just have to look at their views on homosexuals, their views on women.
[03:10:36.090 --> 03:10:38.972]  All these sort of views, they're bringing them with them.
[03:10:38.972 --> 03:10:40.193]  They've come with those views.
[03:10:40.193 --> 03:10:40.934]  That's their mindset.
[03:10:40.934 --> 03:10:41.875]  That's how they've been brought up.
[03:10:41.875 --> 03:10:43.036]  That's what they've drilled into them.
[03:10:43.556 --> 03:10:45.617]  Which is Islam, Islam, Islam.
[03:10:45.617 --> 03:10:48.078]  Which is incompatible with Western democracy and freedom.
[03:10:48.078 --> 03:10:49.399]  Those views are not going to work.
[03:10:49.399 --> 03:10:50.859]  So they've come with those views.
[03:10:50.859 --> 03:10:53.720]  They're not just going to leave them at the door when they come into Birmingham.
[03:10:53.720 --> 03:10:54.781]  They're still going to hold those views.
[03:10:54.781 --> 03:10:57.982]  They're going to look upon our women as filthy.
[03:10:57.982 --> 03:11:02.924]  I just bumped into, yesterday, I bumped into a Luton Town football player and his partner, his wife.
[03:11:02.924 --> 03:11:07.406]  And she told me the amount of times, just go into our football stadium, because our football stadium's in the Muslim community.
[03:11:07.947 --> 03:11:13.813]  The amount of times she's had sexual remarks made to her daily, whenever she's there.
[03:11:13.813 --> 03:11:18.978]  And women should not have to put up with this, but it's the mindset and the culture that we're importing.
[03:11:18.978 --> 03:11:23.742]  And you're right in what you said, because my biggest fear is not groups like Anjum Chowdhury.
[03:11:23.742 --> 03:11:27.446]  I think they're the stupid ones that are telling us what they're going to do.
[03:11:27.446 --> 03:11:29.768]  The ones that are on the street corners telling us what they're going to do.
[03:11:29.768 --> 03:11:30.389]  I don't fear them.
[03:11:31.095 --> 03:11:35.877]  I fear the extremely clever ones who have infiltrated government, infiltrated political parties.
[03:11:35.877 --> 03:11:37.477]  We saw it with Afsala Min.
[03:11:37.477 --> 03:11:47.081]  Afsala Min was a conservative Muslim MP who actually was working, we found out was a radical for 10 years, a plant within the government.
[03:11:47.081 --> 03:11:49.802]  They're the ones I fear and you're right.
[03:11:49.802 --> 03:11:52.263]  Forget terrorism, even if you take terrorism out of the equation.
[03:11:53.012 --> 03:11:55.013]  The future's not right anyway.
[03:11:55.013 --> 03:12:01.457]  The more Islam, the more Muslims, when Islam becomes the dominant culture in your community, we have a problem.
[03:12:01.457 --> 03:12:01.977]  We have a big problem.
[03:12:01.977 --> 03:12:04.859]  And that's not fascist, extremist or racist in any way to say that.
[03:12:04.859 --> 03:12:14.845]  To say that we want to protect this country, we want to protect the Christian, Judeo-Christian culture that we've inherited, our grandparents, is not racist or big here.
[03:12:14.845 --> 03:12:17.266]  But in this country, even just saying that is seen as extreme.
[03:12:19.355 --> 03:12:25.819]  And the point I've made over and over again, this is a religion that kills people who try to leave.
[03:12:25.819 --> 03:12:28.201]  How is that any different from a cult?
[03:12:28.201 --> 03:12:35.205]  And as he said, you look at the polls in these Middle East and South Asian countries, the vast majority of people support that belief.
[03:12:35.205 --> 03:12:38.747]  They're coming into the West, they're importing these beliefs with them.
[03:12:38.747 --> 03:12:46.692]  We're importing a real rape culture while the feminists whine about, you know, in America, for example, a college rape culture that doesn't exist.
[03:12:46.692 --> 03:12:47.533]  It's complete fraud.
[03:12:47.993 --> 03:12:50.835]  Meanwhile, the West is importing a real rape culture.
[03:12:50.835 --> 03:12:53.598]  Complete silence from feminists on that score.
[03:12:53.598 --> 03:13:02.805]  But after, you know, Charlie Hebdo, there was a huge protest in Pakistan from Muslims in support of the Charlie Hebdo jihadists.
[03:13:02.805 --> 03:13:14.314]  So we hear this over and over again, and the left has turned it into a kind of cliché where, for example, when there's a, like a Dylann Roof mass shooting, they say, oh, where are all the moderate Christians denouncing this?
[03:13:14.314 --> 03:13:16.236]  And well, in most cases, they do denounce it.
[03:13:16.616 --> 03:13:25.158]  But for example in Pakistan, they get out on the street, they don't decry Charlie Hebdo, they don't decry the Paris Massacre, they support it.
[03:13:25.158 --> 03:13:26.978]  And many of the polls show that.
[03:13:26.978 --> 03:13:34.199]  So, what do you think prevents so-called moderate Muslims from speaking out against Islamist terror?
[03:13:34.199 --> 03:13:39.500]  Is it just fear of reprisals because it's basically a cult, or is it something more?
[03:13:39.500 --> 03:13:40.540]  It's a combination of things.
[03:13:40.540 --> 03:13:41.280]  It's a combination of things.
[03:13:41.280 --> 03:13:43.081]  Look, after the Charlie Hebdo Massacre, 30,000
[03:13:45.407 --> 03:13:51.870]  British Muslims marched through the city of Birmingham, which is where we're going to be holding up our silent walk on the 6th of February.
[03:13:51.870 --> 03:13:57.113]  They marched through the city of Birmingham demanding blasphemy laws in support, again, of Charlie Hebdo's killers.
[03:13:57.113 --> 03:13:58.734]  They didn't march against the killers.
[03:13:58.734 --> 03:13:59.774]  They didn't march against ISIS.
[03:13:59.774 --> 03:14:01.555]  As we've seen, they don't come out on the streets now.
[03:14:01.555 --> 03:14:02.756]  So it's a combination of things.
[03:14:02.756 --> 03:14:08.279]  It's a combination of things that I believe 30% of British Muslims felt they were justified, the killings.
[03:14:08.737 --> 03:14:11.359]  So that's 30% that are certainly not going to come out and protest.
[03:14:11.359 --> 03:14:15.383]  And that 30% are all probably related to the other ones that aren't going to come out and protest.
[03:14:15.383 --> 03:14:25.171]  And then there is a genuine fear in the community as well, which is justified, because when we're talking about apostates, we've seen recently the apostate in Bradford, who's been targeted for the last 10 years.
[03:14:26.121 --> 03:14:28.143]  There's no charities to help these people.
[03:14:28.143 --> 03:14:32.007]  There's no government schemes to help people leave Islam, which we should be doing.
[03:14:32.007 --> 03:14:39.334]  In a similar way, we have government schemes, especially in Scandinavia, to help gang members leave the gang because they'll be targeted by that gang.
[03:14:39.334 --> 03:14:42.597]  Now in Islam, if you try and leave, you'll be targeted.
[03:14:42.597 --> 03:14:49.484]  There should be charities, government support, all sorts of ways of helping these people leave that fascist ideology.
[03:14:49.484 --> 03:14:50.065]  We don't see it.
[03:14:50.450 --> 03:14:59.515]  Again, everything, as soon as every issue, you're on about feminism, animal rights, whenever it comes to Islam, everyone remains silent.
[03:14:59.515 --> 03:15:04.678]  And that simply, I think, is fear is paralyzing and people are scared.
[03:15:04.678 --> 03:15:08.360]  And to be fair, they've got a reason to be scared.
[03:15:08.360 --> 03:15:13.623]  Because the minute you do speak out, if you're in a job or career, you're probably going to lose it.
[03:15:13.623 --> 03:15:18.606]  I'm sitting in the situation now, six years on, where they can't take anything more from me, other than my life.
[03:15:19.213 --> 03:15:23.676]  So, I'm in a situation where I'll say it, and you yourself, you'll say it.
[03:15:23.676 --> 03:15:30.719]  There's not many people out there, and I don't blame them, because they've watched what happens to people who do.
[03:15:30.719 --> 03:15:34.482]  Who do exercise their freedom of speech, who do decide to criticise Islam.
[03:15:34.482 --> 03:15:35.342]  They've seen the backlash.
[03:15:35.342 --> 03:15:45.267]  It's like, for example, when I walk through my hometown and I get punched on the nose regularly, or I get violently attacked, I quite understand that the local politician probably doesn't want to get punched on the nose or attacked every time he walks through the town.
[03:15:45.267 --> 03:15:46.728]  So he chooses to remain silent.
[03:15:48.616 --> 03:15:49.977]  So it's a combination of things.
[03:15:49.977 --> 03:15:52.038]  It's a difficult situation.
[03:15:52.038 --> 03:16:08.526]  What you actually see now in Europe is the countries that are coming out freely and talking about these issues, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, they're the countries that have not been infiltrated and infected with Islamic immigration and the influence Islam has.
[03:16:10.109 --> 03:16:23.228]  In our countries, when we look at previous world leaders, if we want to look at Sir William Gladstone for example, who there's statues of across our capital city, he held the Quran above his head in the Houses of Parliament and he said there will never be peace on this earth so long as we have this book.
[03:16:23.228 --> 03:16:24.650]  It's a violent and a cursed book.
[03:16:25.450 --> 03:16:28.574]  Winston Churchill said Islam in a man is similar to rabies in a dog.
[03:16:28.574 --> 03:16:41.710]  He said individual Muslims, which they do, will show great, great, great individual, there's great individual things about them, but the power of Islam has the power to bring Europe back into the Dark Ages.
[03:16:41.710 --> 03:16:43.192]  These were world leaders.
[03:16:43.192 --> 03:16:44.794]  Now, if there were no Muslims in Britain,
[03:16:45.374 --> 03:16:47.035]  And we didn't have the influence of Saudi.
[03:16:47.035 --> 03:16:49.456]  Whoever was leading our country would be saying something similar right now.
[03:16:49.456 --> 03:16:51.217]  They'd be coming out saying what Donald Trump said.
[03:16:51.217 --> 03:16:53.518]  They'd be coming out saying what the Czech president said.
[03:16:53.518 --> 03:16:55.799]  They'd be coming out saying what the Hungarian leaders are saying.
[03:16:55.799 --> 03:16:57.800]  They wouldn't be accepting the refugee quotas.
[03:16:57.800 --> 03:17:10.065]  But because we have Islam everywhere in this country, in every political party, in every government position, in every government job, and that's only at 4%, so we really need to wake up to where this country's headed.
[03:17:11.704 --> 03:17:16.166]  And again, completely debunking this religion of peace tag.
[03:17:16.166 --> 03:17:22.489]  If it's a religion of peace, why do its most prominent critics, like yourself, have panic buttons?
[03:17:22.489 --> 03:17:24.330]  Why are they attacked on the street?
[03:17:24.330 --> 03:17:28.271]  Why are they oppressed by the government when they speak out against this?
[03:17:28.271 --> 03:17:30.272]  Again, it completely debunks that notion.
[03:17:30.272 --> 03:17:37.516]  But just in the final couple of minutes here, tell people how they can get the book and tell people about the Pegida March that's going to happen soon.
[03:17:38.956 --> 03:17:41.038]  If you're in America, it's available on Kindle.
[03:17:41.038 --> 03:17:43.820]  So just go on Kindle and search Tommy Robinson.
[03:17:43.820 --> 03:17:56.009]  If you want a paperback or the actual book, then you can just go on my website, TommyRobinson.co.uk or the British Amazon, and you can order the book to be, with international posters to be sent to you.
[03:17:56.009 --> 03:17:59.591]  I think that, I think Americans, when they read it, are going to be gobsmacked.
[03:17:59.591 --> 03:18:04.795]  I think, I think, I say actually say in the book, if there's any politician with an ounce of integrity,
[03:18:05.684 --> 03:18:19.791]  There should be a public inquiry into what's going on with the police, with all these government agencies, with the state-sponsored persecution, in order to silence me and prevent me from having freedom of speech, in order to have a free society to criticise a fascist and backward ideology.
[03:18:19.791 --> 03:18:22.152]  And with regards to the 6th of February,
[03:18:22.864 --> 03:18:27.330]  On the 6th of February, we're changing very much from how the English Defence League went about our demonstrations.
[03:18:27.330 --> 03:18:38.065]  What happened with the English Defence League, I'm not going to apologise for it because there was a hell of a lot of anger and frustration that had built up with years of resentment at being treated like second-class citizens, having our daughters or our sisters raped, terrorism.
[03:18:38.665 --> 03:18:40.046]  We're good to go.
[03:18:55.954 --> 03:18:58.377]  In England's second city, which is Birmingham.
[03:18:58.377 --> 03:19:04.482]  And I've appealed to everyone to come along because you can't sit at home any longer, you can't talk about these issues, you can't moan about them in the pub.
[03:19:04.482 --> 03:19:05.723]  It's time to do something.
[03:19:05.723 --> 03:19:10.968]  And there's many people who are willing to put their life on the line and we're not asking people to come out and get prison sentences or riot or anything like that.
[03:19:10.968 --> 03:19:13.050]  We're just saying come and peacefully walk with us.
[03:19:13.050 --> 03:19:14.972]  Show solidarity with us.
[03:19:14.972 --> 03:19:16.754]  This is so important.
[03:19:16.754 --> 03:19:17.855]  What's happening right now
[03:19:18.502 --> 03:19:23.223]  It's so important in not just England's, not just Britain's, but Europe's future.
[03:19:23.223 --> 03:19:24.363]  Our cultural identity.
[03:19:24.363 --> 03:19:25.984]  Your children's future is at stake.
[03:19:25.984 --> 03:19:28.344]  And all we're asking is you come and walk with us for one day.
[03:19:28.344 --> 03:19:29.905]  Come and join us for one day.
[03:19:29.905 --> 03:19:36.166]  And show people power and show solidarity to the other people who are putting their lives on the line across Europe to oppose the Islamisation taker.
[03:19:36.166 --> 03:19:36.907]  Okay.
[03:19:36.907 --> 03:19:39.007]  The book is Enemy of the State.
[03:19:39.007 --> 03:19:41.048]  Tommy Robinson, thanks for joining us.
[03:19:41.048 --> 03:19:41.588]  Very much.
[03:19:41.588 --> 03:19:42.308]  Thank you for having me on.
[03:19:43.004 --> 03:19:44.125]  Thank you.
[03:19:44.125 --> 03:19:44.446]  Thank you.
[03:19:44.446 --> 03:19:45.447]  There goes Tommy Robinson.
[03:19:45.447 --> 03:19:48.811]  We'll be back after the break with a ton of news and your calls.
[03:19:48.811 --> 03:19:52.937]  This is the fourth hour live of the Alex Jones Show with me, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:19:52.937 --> 03:19:54.719]  Infowars.com.
[03:19:54.719 --> 03:19:55.340]  Don't go away.
[03:20:00.393 --> 03:20:03.995]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?
[03:20:03.995 --> 03:20:06.356]  How would you like to never be cold again?
[03:20:06.356 --> 03:20:13.239]  This is Dale with Fortress Clothing, and I'm here to tell you, you will never be cold again with Fortress.
[03:20:13.239 --> 03:20:23.123]  If you're tired of freezing your butt off, elk hunting, sitting in a tree stand deer hunting, winter camping, fishing, ice fishing, no longer fear the cold.
[03:20:23.123 --> 03:20:26.425]  If you snowmobile, ski, snowboard, get Fortress.
[03:20:27.145 --> 03:20:33.752]  Sledding with the kids, shoveling the walks, shopping, or if you or your spouse get cold feet at home, get Fortress.

[03:20:59.670 --> 03:21:08.014]  We have been fighting this war tirelessly with you at our side, day in and day out, exposing the ludicrous lies and criminal operations of the globalists.
[03:21:08.014 --> 03:21:10.336]  And we're starting to see big effects.
[03:21:10.336 --> 03:21:12.237]  And the word is getting out.
[03:21:12.237 --> 03:21:14.318]  The globalists want to make us dependent.
[03:21:14.318 --> 03:21:18.040]  And as Napoleon famously said, an army marches on its stomach.
[03:21:18.040 --> 03:21:23.542]  Ammunition, food and supplies form the backbone of any offensive, including the Info War.
[03:21:23.542 --> 03:21:26.384]  And our enemies admit they're losing the Info War.
[03:21:26.744 --> 03:21:30.489]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[03:21:30.489 --> 03:21:36.998]  With this in mind, we have held strong to our principles and the decision to refuse any money from globalists or government.
[03:21:36.998 --> 03:21:43.748]  We are funding our crusade against tyranny the old-fashioned way, with pure free-market, free-will capitalism.

[03:21:59.720 --> 03:22:10.624]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:22:10.624 --> 03:22:14.785]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[03:22:14.785 --> 03:22:16.926]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:22:16.926 --> 03:22:22.408]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:22:22.568 --> 03:22:32.590]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:22:32.590 --> 03:22:39.092]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:22:39.092 --> 03:22:42.413]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for a diabetic.
[03:22:42.413 --> 03:22:44.493]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[03:22:44.493 --> 03:22:47.594]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:22:47.654 --> 03:22:50.096]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[03:23:54.540 --> 03:23:57.966]  From all of us here at SupernaturalSilver.com
[03:24:17.110 --> 03:24:21.713]  Welcome back live, fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show with me, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:24:21.713 --> 03:24:30.099]  Earlier, Alex covered this article out of InfoWars, hundreds of refugees caught with images of ISIS flag severed heads on their phones.
[03:24:30.099 --> 03:24:36.883]  Those are asylum seekers coming into Norway, or orphans and widows, as Barack Obama calls them.
[03:24:36.883 --> 03:24:42.006]  Now we've got another article, which is even more shocking to me, out of Israeli National News.
[03:24:42.947 --> 03:24:45.388]  Syrian migrant Allah is great.
[03:24:45.388 --> 03:24:47.429]  ISIS is greater.
[03:24:47.429 --> 03:24:59.153]  Italian police have arrested a Syrian refugee for being a member of the Islamic State organization, slapping him in cuffs shortly after he arrived by boat, along with hundreds of migrants, media reports said Monday.
[03:24:59.833 --> 03:25:09.861]  The man reportedly in his 20s was arrested by officers in Sicily after Italy's Special Operations Division discovered incriminating material on his cell phone.
[03:25:09.861 --> 03:25:19.468]  So we've got refugees coming into the Netherlands bragging about the fact that they were fighting with Al-Qaeda and ISIS being arrested.
[03:25:19.468 --> 03:25:25.993]  We've got refugees coming into Norway with pictures of ISIS flags and headings on their cell phones.
[03:25:26.758 --> 03:25:33.025]  And now we've got another individual coming into Italy again with ISIS symbols on his phone.
[03:25:33.025 --> 03:25:36.669]  He's talking about Allah is great, ISIS is greater.
[03:25:36.669 --> 03:25:42.556]  Again emphasizing the fact that many of these refugees are again only one-fifth Syrian.
[03:25:43.277 --> 03:25:43.758]  We're good to go.
[03:25:58.757 --> 03:26:04.541]  But Angela Merkel says now she wants to drastically reduce refugee arrivals in Germany.
[03:26:04.541 --> 03:26:05.962]  This is out of The Guardian.
[03:26:05.962 --> 03:26:18.132]  Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to drastically decrease the number of refugees coming to Germany, signalling a compromise to critics of her open-door policy from within her Conservatives on the eve of a party congress.
[03:26:18.852 --> 03:26:25.475]  So, she's basically letting almost a million migrants into Germany over the past four, five, six months.
[03:26:25.475 --> 03:26:28.956]  We have rape cases around these migrant camps exploding.
[03:26:28.956 --> 03:26:33.558]  We have migrants attacking nurses and hospital workers who are giving them free healthcare.
[03:26:34.418 --> 03:26:42.186]  And we have the authorities in Germany covering up those reports, in their own words, so as not to legitimise critics of mass migration.
[03:26:42.186 --> 03:26:56.559]  And now, after they've lowered the drawbridge and let all this rape culture come into Germany, Angela Merkel, Time Magazine Person of the Year, finally says that maybe they've gone a little bit too far.
[03:26:56.559 --> 03:26:58.661]  Well again, it's too little, too late.
[03:26:58.661 --> 03:26:58.962]  And again,
[03:27:00.230 --> 03:27:04.491]  Through Facebook, through Twitter, I receive these kind of messages from people every week.
[03:27:04.491 --> 03:27:09.051]  People living in Sweden, Denmark, Germany.
[03:27:09.051 --> 03:27:13.972]  People who are living right next to these migrant camps and they always tell the same story.
[03:27:13.972 --> 03:27:16.093]  We're frightened to go out in the streets.
[03:27:16.093 --> 03:27:17.693]  These people just hang around.
[03:27:17.693 --> 03:27:18.753]  They're violent.
[03:27:18.753 --> 03:27:20.273]  They're intimidating.
[03:27:20.273 --> 03:27:25.514]  They show no will, no motivation to integrate into the local community.
[03:27:25.514 --> 03:27:27.835]  Of course, now we have rape cases exploding.
[03:27:27.835 --> 03:27:29.335]  So somebody sent this to me today.
[03:27:30.523 --> 03:27:36.689]  My uncle, he's 70 years old and has worked for the Housing Council for many decades in Stuttgart, Germany.
[03:27:36.689 --> 03:27:40.292]  Last night he stated that people are being severely lied to.
[03:27:40.292 --> 03:27:45.597]  Legions are arriving daily and the destruction in their wake is difficult to describe.
[03:27:45.597 --> 03:27:51.122]  His own kids, who are in their late 30s, are terrified to go out and do their regular business.
[03:27:51.122 --> 03:27:53.984]  The thefts and assaults are not being thwarted.
[03:27:54.949 --> 03:28:03.731]  So again, more anecdotal evidence, and I get these messages every week now, that this migrant culture that they're importing into these European countries
[03:28:04.790 --> 03:28:10.773]  is not only leading to social upheaval, it's a direct criminal threat to the population.
[03:28:10.773 --> 03:28:14.935]  There's a village not far from where I live of 150 people.
[03:28:14.935 --> 03:28:26.220]  They're about to bring in 200 migrants, eclipsing the population of the village, to live in a centre right in the middle of that village, which doesn't even have a shop.
[03:28:27.119 --> 03:28:35.949]  It's a tiny little gambler and these these thoughts of migrants are being brought in by government order basically in league with the local council.
[03:28:35.949 --> 03:28:37.110]  People are freaking out.
[03:28:37.110 --> 03:28:39.212]  They're starting campaigns about it.
[03:28:39.212 --> 03:28:40.834]  And it's interesting to consider, you know.
[03:28:41.934 --> 03:28:46.857]  In the United Kingdom we had, what is it, probably up to six, seven hundred thousand now.
[03:28:46.857 --> 03:29:01.426]  People signing this petition to ban Donald Trump from the UK for his comments on Muslim immigration, which will have no effect whatsoever on UK immigration policy, but they signed the petition to virtue signal and look trendy to all their friends.
[03:29:01.426 --> 03:29:09.451]  But whenever the issue of one of these migrant influxes being, you know, 200 migrants being housed in one of these camps near where they live,
[03:29:10.231 --> 03:29:17.514]  ...comes to bear, all these people freak out, they start aggressive campaigns to try to prevent it from happening.
[03:29:17.514 --> 03:29:25.597]  So how many of these people in person, vocally, are saying, yes, we're great humanitarians, let all the refugees come in?
[03:29:26.866 --> 03:29:34.070]  Well, it's when they actually come in, they're writing letters, they're freaking out, they're starting campaigns to get rid of them and to not have that happen.
[03:29:34.070 --> 03:29:37.331]  Because in reality, they know what it's all about.
[03:29:37.331 --> 03:29:39.833]  They don't want to import that culture.
[03:29:39.833 --> 03:29:42.094]  Back with more news after the break.
[03:29:42.094 --> 03:29:44.855]  It's the Alex Jones Show 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:29:44.855 --> 03:29:46.316]  Infowars.com.
[03:29:46.316 --> 03:29:49.077]  Stay tuned.
[03:29:49.077 --> 03:29:50.458]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.458 --> 03:29:52.999]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.999 --> 03:29:55.681]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.841 --> 03:30:02.365]  Hillary Clinton wants to censor people who make fun of her.
[03:30:02.365 --> 03:30:08.354]  She was recently trying to censor comedy skits that poked fun at her, which were produced by the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles, California.
[03:30:08.354 --> 03:30:14.925]  The owner of the Laugh Factory, Jamie Masada, told Judicial Watch that her campaign threatened to put him out of business if he didn't pull the videos.
[03:30:15.145 --> 03:30:24.011]  So in response to this attack on free speech, InfoWars.com has launched the Make Fun of Hillary Defend the First Amendment contest with a first place cash prize of $5,000.
[03:30:24.011 --> 03:30:29.194]  We want the funniest, most outrageous satire and comedy videos guaranteed to make Hillary's blood boil.

[03:31:10.374 --> 03:31:12.276]  And the word is getting out.
[03:31:12.276 --> 03:31:14.337]  The globalists want to make us dependent.
[03:31:14.337 --> 03:31:18.100]  And as Napoleon famously said, an army marches on its stomach.
[03:31:18.100 --> 03:31:23.564]  Ammunition, food, and supplies form the backbone of any offensive, including the Info War.
[03:31:23.564 --> 03:31:26.446]  And our enemies admit they're losing the Info War.
[03:31:26.906 --> 03:31:30.509]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[03:31:30.509 --> 03:31:37.014]  With this in mind, we have held strong to our principles and the decision to refuse any money from globalists or government.

[03:32:32.730 --> 03:32:37.712]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[03:32:37.712 --> 03:32:41.013]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:32:41.013 --> 03:32:44.494]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:32:44.494 --> 03:32:46.475]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:32:46.475 --> 03:32:48.555]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:32:48.555 --> 03:32:50.576]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[03:32:50.576 --> 03:32:56.158]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:33:09.321 --> 03:33:14.488]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:33:18.590 --> 03:33:22.313]  Tell your children not to walk my way.
[03:33:22.313 --> 03:33:24.996]  Tell your children not to hear my words.
[03:33:24.996 --> 03:33:26.977]  What they mean, what they say.
[03:33:26.977 --> 03:33:29.439]  We're at the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:29.439 --> 03:33:31.221]  We're going to go to a video here in a second.
[03:33:31.221 --> 03:33:34.444]  We won't have time to play this clip, but it's an article up on Infowars.com.
[03:33:34.444 --> 03:33:39.108]  Muslim congressman claims white supremacists bigger threat than Islamic terrorists.
[03:33:39.628 --> 03:33:47.852]  Muslim Congressman Andre Carson told ABC's This Week that white supremacists represent a bigger threat than Islamic terrorists.
[03:33:47.852 --> 03:34:01.059]  So again, they're pushing this myth despite the fact, you know, we've had Fort Hood, Boston bombing, the Oklahoma beheading, Garland, Chattanooga, San Bernardino, all massacres carried out by Islamist terrorists.
[03:34:01.059 --> 03:34:06.942]  Yet we've still got this narrative that the most potent terror threat is white supremacists.
[03:34:06.942 --> 03:34:08.283]  The way they're doing this is they're
[03:34:08.683 --> 03:34:12.205]  First of all, claiming that there are 355 mass shootings this year.
[03:34:12.205 --> 03:34:14.086]  That's been completely debunked.
[03:34:14.086 --> 03:34:17.527]  The FBI says it's only 41 mass shootings this year.
[03:34:17.527 --> 03:34:28.553]  They're taking that number of 355, claiming that these are all acts of domestic terrorism, even though the vast majority of them have nothing to do with terrorism, which is a political motive.
[03:34:29.033 --> 03:34:36.195]  And then basically just blaming all white people for those shootings, even though probably more than half of them are gang related.
[03:34:36.195 --> 03:34:46.817]  Again, to deny the threat posed by Islamist terror in America, which again statistically is very low, but it's certainly a lot higher than so-called white supremacists.
[03:34:46.817 --> 03:34:49.398]  So check out that article up on Infowars.com.
[03:34:49.838 --> 03:34:51.520]  We're going to go to a video now.
[03:34:51.520 --> 03:35:00.933]  Richard Reed sat down with Rob Dew to talk about how the Democrats are using secret political strategies to control Republican candidates.
[03:35:00.933 --> 03:35:01.594]  Here's that clip.
[03:35:06.135 --> 03:35:11.719]  The guy sitting next to me basically is instrumental in getting Roger Stone and Donald Trump onto the Alex Jones Show.
[03:35:11.719 --> 03:35:12.540]  That's Richard Reeves.
[03:35:12.540 --> 03:35:25.228]  He's been a long time employee of InfoWars and we're going to be sending him out on the road to do some political correspondence in these Republican primaries and Democratic primaries and caucuses that are going to be happening in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina.
[03:35:25.228 --> 03:35:25.749]  Those are the big
[03:35:26.229 --> 03:35:27.110]  We're good to go.
[03:35:47.313 --> 03:35:49.395]  They've adjusted primary dates.
[03:35:49.395 --> 03:35:52.338]  They've adjusted the way the delegates are proportioned.
[03:35:52.338 --> 03:35:53.899]  In some states, winner-take-all.
[03:35:53.899 --> 03:35:56.301]  In some states, they're proportional.
[03:35:56.301 --> 03:36:02.567]  So, we're really going to be having to watch for the dirty tricks by the GOP and the RNC.
[03:36:02.567 --> 03:36:04.909]  So, we're really going to have to be on our toes.
[03:36:05.029 --> 03:36:12.074]  And we saw this on the last two primary seasons with Ron Paul just basically getting Iowa stolen from him.
[03:36:12.074 --> 03:36:20.080]  Like it was Rick Santorum in the last election where he suddenly came up with this fairy dust money to just blitz the area and kind of steal that.
[03:36:20.080 --> 03:36:21.401]  And then he disappeared.
[03:36:21.401 --> 03:36:22.302]  He was just a ringer.
[03:36:22.302 --> 03:36:27.125]  He was thrown in there to take away the momentum from Ron Paul so then no one could give him legitimacy.
[03:36:27.125 --> 03:36:28.206]  Kind of what they're doing with Trump.
[03:36:28.206 --> 03:36:31.689]  Trump is an outsider compared to the rest of the GOP establishment and they are afraid of him.
[03:36:31.949 --> 03:36:32.809]  That's right, Rob.
[03:36:32.809 --> 03:36:36.671]  And even prior to that, 2008 with Huckabee, that was a total disaster.
[03:36:36.671 --> 03:36:40.052]  So yes, now we can watch for the dirty tricks to be coming in.
[03:36:40.052 --> 03:36:46.054]  The Republicans are dead set on making sure that Donald Trump does not get this nomination.
[03:36:46.054 --> 03:36:51.316]  And by that I mean the Republican establishment, along with the Democrats that have infiltrated the party.
[03:36:51.316 --> 03:36:51.836]  It's going to be
[03:36:52.848 --> 03:37:07.051]  Really tricky to do this and what it was ultimately with this what's called the splitter strategy is we had the Republicans gather up at some point in the past and they had a huddle and they decided you know what Jeb Bush is going to be our nominee for 2016.
[03:37:07.051 --> 03:37:08.371]  How do we get that done?
[03:37:08.371 --> 03:37:10.952]  So what they looked at is the splitter strategy.
[03:37:10.952 --> 03:37:15.113]  We all know that one of the mottos of the New World Order is divide and conquer.
[03:37:15.113 --> 03:37:15.393]  Right.
[03:37:15.393 --> 03:37:16.213]  So what they did
[03:37:16.893 --> 03:37:18.856]  Is they came up with all these candidates.
[03:37:18.856 --> 03:37:20.278]  That's why you have Jeb Bush.
[03:37:20.278 --> 03:37:21.619]  That's why you have Marco Rubio.
[03:37:21.619 --> 03:37:24.743]  That's why you have Santorum and Kasich.
[03:37:24.743 --> 03:37:26.205]  Kasich is basically a hitman.
[03:37:26.205 --> 03:37:29.208]  He's just brought in to just hit Trump constantly.
[03:37:29.208 --> 03:37:30.410]  No substance to his attacks.
[03:37:30.410 --> 03:37:32.132]  He's basically worthless in the polls.
[03:37:32.132 --> 03:37:33.093]  I mean he's pulling at like 1% maybe.
[03:37:33.894 --> 03:37:34.314]  That's right.
[03:37:34.314 --> 03:37:35.055]  That's his only job.
[03:37:35.055 --> 03:37:35.876]  But he's still in it.
[03:37:35.876 --> 03:37:38.678]  So for the GOP, he sits there and he's got plenty of money.
[03:37:38.678 --> 03:37:39.759]  He's well funded.
[03:37:39.759 --> 03:37:44.063]  But he can sit there and hit the barbed wire for the GOP and keep attacking Trump like a chihuahua.
[03:37:44.063 --> 03:37:45.605]  That's a great analogy.
[03:37:45.605 --> 03:37:47.206]  He's a World War I barbed wire guy.
[03:37:47.206 --> 03:37:49.388]  He just jumps on it and lets everybody else run over top of him.
[03:37:49.448 --> 03:37:50.048]  There you go.
[03:37:50.048 --> 03:37:50.728]  So that's it.
[03:37:50.728 --> 03:37:57.291]  So they came up with the splitter strategy, but their splitter strategy didn't take into account Donald Trump.
[03:37:57.291 --> 03:37:57.611]  That's true.
[03:37:57.611 --> 03:37:59.551]  And that's the thing.
[03:37:59.551 --> 03:38:13.636]  The splitter strategy before Donald Trump was that they would get Jeb Bush, Rick Santorum, they would get Jindal, they would get, they didn't mind even Ted Cruz and Rand Paul stepping in there because what they would do is bring in more candidates like Huckabee, Santorum to split
[03:38:16.517 --> 03:38:18.938]  Their support because they did a lot of polling.
[03:38:18.938 --> 03:38:24.119]  I remember getting a polling call back in 2006 during a governor's race here in Texas.
[03:38:24.119 --> 03:38:28.601]  I got a call, a polling call, would you like to see Jeb Bush as president?
[03:38:28.601 --> 03:38:29.381]  That was back in 2006.
[03:38:29.381 --> 03:38:30.982]  That's nine years ago folks.
[03:38:30.982 --> 03:38:40.345]  So that's how long the Jeb Bush being the nominee of the Republican Party in 2016 has been in the works because I got that call and so did a friend of mine and it was unbelievable.
[03:38:40.345 --> 03:38:42.185]  So what they have done is since 2012, 2013, 2014,
[03:38:44.969 --> 03:39:00.386]  The Republican Party with the Democrats and the NWO have conspired to set up the splitter strategy where every time Ted Cruz gets in or Rand Paul gets in, Jeb Bush gets in, what they do is, alright, what other outside candidate that's with us with the GOP establishment
[03:39:00.686 --> 03:39:04.267]  What other candidates can we bring in to help fracture and split those votes?
[03:39:04.267 --> 03:39:11.550]  Because they know, bottom line, all the support that Jeb Bush can generate is between 15 and 20 percent of the electorate.
[03:39:11.550 --> 03:39:23.994]  So they actually devised a way by manipulating the way the primaries fall, the way the primary dates fall, the way the delegates are proportioned, or winner take all, the way that works.
[03:39:23.994 --> 03:39:28.016]  They've done all that to rig it so that Jeb Bush could have won.
[03:39:28.516 --> 03:39:31.557]  With 15 to 25 percent of the electorate's support.
[03:39:31.557 --> 03:39:31.897]  That's all.
[03:39:31.897 --> 03:39:34.858]  And they made these rule changes, what, back in 2012?
[03:39:34.858 --> 03:39:40.240]  They started looking at those rules back in 2012 during the RNC convention back then.
[03:39:40.240 --> 03:39:44.341]  Many people know about how Ron Paul got ripped off back in the 2012 election.
[03:39:44.341 --> 03:39:51.163]  They made those rule changes back then and they also kept modifying and tinkering and tweaking like a sculpture, carefully chipping away.
[03:39:51.163 --> 03:39:53.043]  Alright, how can we set it up?
[03:39:53.043 --> 03:39:57.885]  We know Jeb Bush can only get 15 to 25 percent of the electorate to vote for him and come and support him.
[03:39:58.685 --> 03:40:05.709]  In the delegate race, so we gotta rig it to where he can still beat everybody by fracturing the vote.
[03:40:05.709 --> 03:40:06.690]  So that's what they've done.
[03:40:06.690 --> 03:40:10.672]  And that's, like I said, that's before they figured and calculated how Donald Trump was gonna step in.
[03:40:10.672 --> 03:40:12.493]  Sitting next to me is Richard Reeves.
[03:40:12.493 --> 03:40:15.455]  He is our, I guess you could say our political operative of the bunch.
[03:40:15.455 --> 03:40:21.358]  He's been involved in the political process since 2008, even before that when Ross Perot was running.
[03:40:21.358 --> 03:40:23.139]  And we saw what happened when Ross Perot ran.
[03:40:23.399 --> 03:40:32.662]  Everybody liked his ideas but he didn't quite by getting out of the race and getting back in he lost that momentum which led to a Bill Clinton election in eight years of Bill Clinton.
[03:40:32.662 --> 03:40:39.484]  We could even see the same thing if they're able to get Trump out of the nomination process for the Republican Party.
[03:40:39.484 --> 03:40:45.906]  He runs independent and there's just not enough support there for people wanting to jump ship out of the Democrat or RINO
[03:40:46.686 --> 03:40:50.269]  You know, two-party system, and so we get a Hillary Clinton or a Jeb Bush.
[03:40:50.269 --> 03:40:52.490]  I mean, either way, we're going to lose with that.
[03:40:52.490 --> 03:40:58.014]  But getting back, you were talking about the splitter strategy, how they've saturated the field, but they didn't count on Trump coming in, right?
[03:40:58.014 --> 03:40:58.374]  That's right.
[03:40:58.374 --> 03:40:59.495]  They didn't count on Trump.
[03:40:59.495 --> 03:41:02.818]  And to back up what you said a minute ago, talking about Ross Perot, this is very important.
[03:41:02.818 --> 03:41:03.858]  This is very key.
[03:41:03.858 --> 03:41:06.520]  This is why third-party efforts are a negative thing.
[03:41:06.520 --> 03:41:14.666]  The Democrat and Republican parties, with the help of the NWO and all their money and their financiers, has totally rigged the electorate system, okay?
[03:41:15.226 --> 03:41:15.346]  It's
[03:41:30.418 --> 03:41:30.638]  I think so.
[03:41:48.775 --> 03:42:01.508]  Those people that were going to vote in the primaries for Donald Trump, abandon ship and go third party, then all of a sudden we get the same rhinos, the same entrenched establishment Republicans, the same entrenched establishment Democrats, talk about a disaster.
[03:42:01.508 --> 03:42:02.910]  This is not just about Donald Trump.
[03:42:02.910 --> 03:42:05.012]  This is not just about the presidential candidates.
[03:42:05.012 --> 03:42:06.694]  This is way, way bigger than that.
[03:42:07.660 --> 03:42:20.069]  If we go upstream of the voting process, of the primary process, the way the votes are counted there, and if we go upstream of the general election process, we go up to the headwaters of the political process.
[03:42:20.069 --> 03:42:22.151]  That's where the candidates spawn from.
[03:42:22.151 --> 03:42:23.652]  That's where they come from.
[03:42:23.652 --> 03:42:31.458]  So, what we need to do is be looking at that, because that, ironically, it only takes a 2 or 3 percent minority of people
[03:42:32.336 --> 03:42:33.196]  I don't
[03:42:51.465 --> 03:42:52.906]  Happened in Florida when Jeb was governor.
[03:42:52.906 --> 03:42:54.967]  There you go, the hanging chad election.
[03:42:54.967 --> 03:43:02.410]  So, it just never ends how much fraud we find within the government and the New World Order and Democrat-Republican Party.
[03:43:02.410 --> 03:43:09.793]  So, getting up to those headwaters though, where these candidates come from, slowly but surely we're seeing better candidates arise.
[03:43:09.793 --> 03:43:13.835]  We used to have one guy in the House that was liberty and freedom minded, and that was Ron Paul.
[03:43:14.375 --> 03:43:19.184]  But now we've got the Freedom Liberty Coalition in the house that consists of, you know, about 20 or 30 people.
[03:43:19.184 --> 03:43:21.969]  20 or 30 members in the house.
[03:43:21.969 --> 03:43:23.392]  Well, that's a long way from one.
[03:43:24.282 --> 03:43:26.084]  We could double that in an election.
[03:43:26.084 --> 03:43:42.739]  You know, in this primary, that is actually, to me, the most exciting facet of this whole thing right now, is that we could see Republican Rhino incumbents, the John Boehners in the Republican Party, the Paul Rhines in the Republican Party, they may not make it out of their primaries.
[03:43:42.739 --> 03:43:49.986]  I'm really looking forward to that, because you could see, if you add up Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul,
[03:43:50.851 --> 03:43:51.232]  That's right.
[03:44:06.295 --> 03:44:07.696]  They're ready for a real change.
[03:44:07.696 --> 03:44:11.139]  We were talking about how we've got potential bombshell inside information.
[03:44:11.139 --> 03:44:12.360]  That's right, yeah.
[03:44:12.360 --> 03:44:15.503]  So if Trump does win the nomination, what are they going to pull?
[03:44:15.503 --> 03:44:28.253]  If it looks like Trump is going to win the nomination, folks, then the scuttlebutt is the inside track rumor from sources that we have are that Barack Obama will
[03:44:29.227 --> 03:44:29.507]  I think so.
[03:44:54.930 --> 03:45:00.596]  Literally, yank the lesbian witch out with a hook and install Creepy Uncle Joe.
[03:45:00.596 --> 03:45:03.799]  I mean, and you look at any of those people.
[03:45:03.799 --> 03:45:09.264]  I mean, just totally worthless as humans, have no care at all for this country at all.
[03:45:09.264 --> 03:45:15.250]  Just want to drive us into the ground, spit us out, use us, our energy, just pull everything against us.
[03:45:15.250 --> 03:45:16.352]  We got to do something.
[03:45:16.352 --> 03:45:18.614]  So get involved in your political process out there.
[03:45:18.894 --> 03:45:20.635]  There's no better time than now.
[03:45:20.635 --> 03:45:24.616]  Find out what the rules are, because by the time these elections start up, it may be too late to get involved.
[03:45:24.616 --> 03:45:27.838]  Absolutely.
[03:45:27.838 --> 03:45:36.081]  So we're short on time, so we're going to go straight to the next clip, which is about the Infowars Solar Base Station, a new product at infowarsstore.com.
[03:45:36.081 --> 03:45:37.402]  Here's Alex to talk about it.
[03:45:38.723 --> 03:45:48.346]  This is just the best vetted technology in solar panels for the price, whether it's for your hunting shack or part of your house.
[03:45:48.346 --> 03:45:53.327]  Whatever the case is, it is mobile like a suitcase you can roll around.
[03:45:53.327 --> 03:45:55.028]  It's got the solar panels that come with it.
[03:45:55.868 --> 03:46:03.413]  And the price is roughly half of the competitor, and they don't even have as much power, and it's not even the best solar panels.
[03:46:03.413 --> 03:46:06.755]  It's just people keep selling the stuff that's 10 years old.
[03:46:06.755 --> 03:46:09.576]  This is the latest, greatest for the price.
[03:46:09.576 --> 03:46:15.540]  It is the InfoWars solar base station power supply, and CJ is here.
[03:46:15.540 --> 03:46:17.301]  He volunteered to come in and talk about it.
[03:46:17.301 --> 03:46:18.822]  Also, David Knight ran in and pointed out
[03:46:19.202 --> 03:46:21.565]  You can get a federal tax credit for this system.
[03:46:21.565 --> 03:46:26.750]  So, so describe to us why you're such a fan of the Info or Solar Base Station power supply.
[03:46:26.750 --> 03:46:35.019]  Tim Fergé recommended I speak about this because I've had some experience building homebrew solar systems, essentially to supplement electrical costs.
[03:46:35.659 --> 03:46:44.287]  And it's always been a lot more work than I felt it was worth, simply because of the cost of the panels, the technology lagging behind.
[03:46:44.287 --> 03:46:54.537]  And I think what's great about this is it's a monocrystalline panel instead of polycrystalline panels, which are simply separate pieces of material that absorb light and convert it to energy.
[03:46:54.537 --> 03:46:57.039]  This is similar to perfect surface copper.
[03:46:57.039 --> 03:46:59.962]  In electrical terms, you get more
[03:47:00.542 --> 03:47:04.745]  More energy or more efficiency out of a smoother surface.
[03:47:04.745 --> 03:47:07.627]  And so the panels themselves are fantastic.
[03:47:07.627 --> 03:47:09.248]  They'll fold in half.
[03:47:09.248 --> 03:47:11.809]  It's about the size of a large slim suitcase.
[03:47:11.809 --> 03:47:14.691]  The company that's building these wants to take out of the market.
[03:47:14.691 --> 03:47:16.052]  They don't want to put crap out.
[03:47:16.052 --> 03:47:16.953]  Not at all.
[03:47:16.953 --> 03:47:19.334]  Similar pieces of equipment go for about $5,000.
[03:47:20.535 --> 03:47:25.457]  So when I say it's half the cost, it's way less than half.
[03:47:25.457 --> 03:47:35.301]  The quality of the batteries I think is fantastic because it's a lithium iron or lithium ferrous type cell.
[03:47:35.301 --> 03:47:39.763]  It's going to last a lot longer than a lithium polymer or a conventional lithium ion.
[03:47:40.864 --> 03:47:52.055]  It's discharge rate is going to be a little bit slower, but because of what it is and because the durability, you get a lot more charges and discharges out of this kind of cell.
[03:47:52.055 --> 03:47:52.636]  I believe it's up to 2,000.
[03:47:54.449 --> 03:47:59.573]  Let's just be clear, there's only 98 of these, I should say, because I'm getting two of them myself.
[03:47:59.573 --> 03:48:06.359]  You've got to have one in your house as backup and also one portable when you go camping or whatever.
[03:48:06.359 --> 03:48:09.302]  I keep using the term because that's what I tell my guys.
[03:48:09.302 --> 03:48:10.723]  I want game changers.
[03:48:10.723 --> 03:48:19.170]  I want the best reviewed, highest quality, bang for your buck, companies that are aggressively wanting to dominate markets, who don't just want to be sitting on their laurels.
[03:48:19.170 --> 03:48:21.012]  And the folks we got this from are awesome.
[03:48:21.252 --> 03:48:23.274]  I immediately thought of my grandmother when I saw it.
[03:48:23.274 --> 03:48:24.775]  She lives in a very rural area, has COPD,
[03:48:48.957 --> 03:48:53.619]  As an oxygen machine, as a CPAP and a nebulizer.
[03:48:53.619 --> 03:48:56.160]  And when the power goes out, they do have a generator.
[03:48:56.160 --> 03:48:59.501]  It's noisy, but it relies on a steady supply of gasoline.
[03:48:59.501 --> 03:49:03.203]  And if you're snowed in and you can't get that, the sun is still there.
[03:49:03.203 --> 03:49:13.347]  And what makes it great is that even in overcast situations, like you'll find in winter, it's going to absorb almost as much as a conventional solar panel on a cloudy day.
[03:49:13.347 --> 03:49:16.788]  Along with an AC outlet, you've got 12 volt outlets, 12 volts at
[03:49:18.949 --> 03:49:21.892]  I believe 20 amps, so you can charge a car.
[03:49:21.892 --> 03:49:31.380]  If you don't have a portable charger, and you have this in your car, for example, while traveling, going hunting, camping, fishing, and you need to charge a battery, it's capable of that.
[03:49:31.380 --> 03:49:42.029]  It does come with that LED work lamp, which in the event of darkness, you've got a full battery and you need to work on something, you've got light available, it would be great for a job call.
[03:49:42.029 --> 03:49:44.791]  And a lot of the panels fold together and fit so nicely.
[03:49:45.772 --> 03:49:47.294]  Transportability as well.
[03:49:47.294 --> 03:49:48.616]  And durability.
[03:49:48.616 --> 03:49:49.998]  It's got a protective casing around it.
[03:49:49.998 --> 03:49:53.542]  Most of the panels that I purchased in the past were very fragile.
[03:49:53.542 --> 03:49:59.810]  You basically set them up somewhere and try not to touch them again because they're subject to cracking.
[03:49:59.810 --> 03:50:01.993]  This is very, very sturdy.
[03:50:02.293 --> 03:50:10.981]  For people that want to really have portable power, these are amazing units, and it's something not just for preparedness, but just for everyday life.
[03:50:10.981 --> 03:50:13.363]  It's very, very, very, very exciting.
[03:50:13.363 --> 03:50:14.004]  It is.
[03:50:14.004 --> 03:50:19.228]  For everyday life, you can put one of these in your house, and in some states, you qualify for a tax credit up to 30% of the cost.
[03:50:20.229 --> 03:50:20.449]  Absolutely.
[03:50:20.449 --> 03:50:22.370]  So if you did use this over a year or so, you'd get your money back.
[03:50:50.760 --> 03:50:51.321]  More than likely.
[03:50:51.321 --> 03:50:53.865]  You'd certainly get the peace of mind back.
[03:50:53.865 --> 03:50:54.626]  That's certain.
[03:50:54.626 --> 03:50:58.872]  This is definitely a great Christmas gift to your family, to yourself, to your loved ones.
[03:51:00.768 --> 03:51:02.749]  My name is Don Whiskin.
[03:51:02.749 --> 03:51:07.733]  In 1994, I lost my 62-year-old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[03:51:07.733 --> 03:51:11.735]  In 1977, my 44-year-old brother was found dead in his apartment.
[03:51:11.735 --> 03:51:13.296]  He suffered a heart attack.
[03:51:13.296 --> 03:51:17.379]  In January of 98, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed.
[03:51:17.379 --> 03:51:21.962]  21 days later, my 53-year-old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital.
[03:51:21.962 --> 03:51:22.803]  He waited too long.
[03:51:23.223 --> 03:51:26.584]  In June, that same year, I almost joined them at 42.
[03:51:26.584 --> 03:51:27.464]  What did I do?
[03:51:27.464 --> 03:51:34.926]  I took a 7-herb formula I now call ExtendoVite, made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, hawthorn, milk thistle, and valerian.
[03:51:34.926 --> 03:51:43.348]  Based on German studies of natural medicine, ExtendoVite is designed to clear blocked arteries, clean the toxins from your blood, and improve your immune system.
[03:51:43.348 --> 03:51:45.028]  To get your ExtendoVite, call 1-877-928-8822.

[03:51:59.935 --> 03:52:01.597]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:52:01.597 --> 03:52:03.077]  You can't survive without it.
[03:52:03.077 --> 03:52:04.258]  But where do you get it?
[03:52:04.258 --> 03:52:10.022]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:52:10.262 --> 03:52:16.164]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[03:52:16.164 --> 03:52:33.031]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[03:52:33.431 --> 03:52:35.912]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:52:35.912 --> 03:52:37.393]  Stainless steel construction.

[03:52:38.414 --> 03:52:39.334]  Low maintenance.
[03:52:39.334 --> 03:52:41.435]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:53:00.223 --> 03:53:01.584]  911, what is your emergency?
[03:53:01.584 --> 03:53:03.086]  There's somebody in my house.

[03:53:04.367 --> 03:53:07.330]  A home break-in happens every 22 seconds.
[03:53:07.330 --> 03:53:11.754]  Homes without a security system are up to three times more vulnerable to a burglary.

[03:54:12.799 --> 03:54:16.982]  Final segment of the 4th Hour Overdrive of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:16.982 --> 03:54:19.744]  Trump schools pompous Saudi Prince.
[03:54:19.744 --> 03:54:22.527]  Has your country taken any of the Syrian refugees?
[03:54:22.527 --> 03:54:28.731]  Of course, over the weekend, we had a Saudi Prince lecture Donald Trump on human rights.
[03:54:28.731 --> 03:54:38.859]  This is the country that has 100,000 air-conditioned tents sitting empty for most of the year, that could house 3 million refugees.
[03:54:38.859 --> 03:54:41.641]  How many refugees has Saudi Arabia taken in?
[03:54:41.641 --> 03:54:42.142]  Zero!
[03:54:42.742 --> 03:54:47.044]  And yet they're lecturing Trump on his human rights credentials.
[03:54:47.044 --> 03:55:00.711]  This is the country that beheads gay people, they stone rape victims to death, and they're lecturing Donald Trump saying that he's hateful for calling for a temporary limitation on Muslim immigration.
[03:55:00.711 --> 03:55:03.233]  And again, it's done very little to affect his poll numbers.
[03:55:03.233 --> 03:55:03.553]  In fact,
[03:55:04.943 --> 03:55:08.345]  Politico is reporting Trump hits a new high in national poll.
[03:55:08.345 --> 03:55:11.107]  Donald Trump just got a little more vault in his ceiling.
[03:55:11.107 --> 03:55:18.831]  Nationwide, the polling-obsessed Manhattan multi-billionaire and leading Republican presidential candidate broke into the 40s on Monday.
[03:55:18.831 --> 03:55:25.916]  So as a result of these comments, which again, half of the leftists said, oh, this is finally going to be the issue that sinks Donald Trump.
[03:55:26.596 --> 03:55:29.038]  His poll numbers have only shot up.
[03:55:29.038 --> 03:55:36.863]  Again, there's still a debate over whether he can defeat Hillary Clinton in a hypothetical head-to-head when it comes down to it.
[03:55:36.863 --> 03:55:39.704]  He is making strides in that department.
[03:55:39.704 --> 03:55:44.828]  His previous numbers show that he was down as much as 15% on Hillary.
[03:55:44.828 --> 03:55:50.851]  A more recent poll shows that he's ahead or just behind, so that seems to be changing as well.
[03:55:50.851 --> 03:55:52.913]  We also had an article, I believe it was on Friday,
[03:55:54.184 --> 03:55:57.505]  Muslim who threatened knife attack on Trump gets secret service visit.
[03:55:57.505 --> 03:56:05.587]  Now, of course, this was the Muslim guy who put up a YouTube video maniacally waving knives around, threatening to circumcise Donald Trump.
[03:56:05.587 --> 03:56:11.749]  In a separate video, he threatens to shoot anybody who links the religion of Islam with ISIS.
[03:56:12.529 --> 03:56:17.973]  Those videos are still up on YouTube, where he's actually threatening to attack public figures.
[03:56:17.973 --> 03:56:19.754]  They haven't been age-restricted.
[03:56:19.754 --> 03:56:21.595]  They haven't been deleted.
[03:56:21.595 --> 03:56:32.523]  Whereas my video, for example, on the Charlie Hebdo massacre, which merely showed a screenshot of one of the police officers who was later killed, was censored, was deleted off of YouTube.
[03:56:32.523 --> 03:56:40.448]  So again, it comes back to this double standard of, quote, hateful rhetoric from the right and left being treated differently.
[03:56:40.448 --> 03:56:41.169]  They just had a
[03:56:41.869 --> 03:56:54.538]  A video out of Portland, Oregon, which we had up on the website, where they're bashing a Donald Trump piñata with kids while cussing in front of them and basically saying that the kids can reenact killing Donald Trump.
[03:56:54.538 --> 03:56:56.279]  Now, that might have been a bit of fun.
[03:56:56.279 --> 03:56:58.140]  It obviously wasn't hate speech.
[03:56:58.140 --> 03:57:08.187]  But again, imagine if a Tea Party group had had an event where they held up a severed head of a mock Obama and were joking about killing Obama.
[03:57:08.187 --> 03:57:09.188]  I mean, people who have had
[03:57:09.768 --> 03:57:15.373]  Parades which show Obama as a zombie have been investigated by the FBI.
[03:57:15.373 --> 03:57:23.460]  And yet this guy who's threatening to attack Donald Trump, who, remember, is under Secret Service protection, gets a visit from the Secret Service.
[03:57:23.460 --> 03:57:25.701]  He merely says, oh, I don't want to talk to you.
[03:57:25.701 --> 03:57:27.002]  They leave him alone.
[03:57:27.002 --> 03:57:29.504]  And again, the videos are still up on YouTube.
[03:57:30.339 --> 03:57:37.266]  We also had the ACLU leader who called for killing Donald Trump supporters last week.
[03:57:37.266 --> 03:57:42.571]  He's resigned of his own accord, but again, no massive backlash to that.
[03:57:42.571 --> 03:57:48.937]  Again, I made a video about the religion of Islam, saying it's not a religion of peace, which again is blasphemy to the left.
[03:57:49.710 --> 03:58:08.016]  Somebody reported me to the police in the United Kingdom for what they said was an online hate crime for merely analysing Sharia law and saying that stoning female rape victims to death, beheading gay people, killing people who leave the religion of Islam
[03:58:08.476 --> 03:58:14.101]  ...was probably indicative of the fact that Islam is not a religion of peace.
[03:58:14.101 --> 03:58:20.886]  I get reported to the police for that, whereas Islamic hate preachers in the UK can call for stoning homosexuals to death.
[03:58:20.886 --> 03:58:22.628]  Nothing happens to them again.
[03:58:22.628 --> 03:58:24.890]  Complete double standard.
[03:58:24.890 --> 03:58:27.051]  That's going to wrap it up for today's show, though.
[03:58:27.051 --> 03:58:32.316]  We'll be back with the InfoWars Nightly News, of course, live show tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[03:58:32.316 --> 03:58:33.076]  That's going to do it.
[03:58:33.076 --> 03:58:35.538]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:35.538 --> 03:58:36.259]  Thanks for joining us.
