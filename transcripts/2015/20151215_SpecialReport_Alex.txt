[00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:14.912]  After yesterday's horrific tragedy in San Bernardino, California, people are demanding answers as to why assailants opened fire, killing 14 people and wounding several others.
[00:00:15.332 --> 00:00:18.853]  Some people have gone as far as to speculate it was because of Christmas.
[00:00:20.113 --> 00:00:23.654]  I think we will eventually get some indication on what that dispute was about.
[00:00:24.234 --> 00:00:25.674]  This was a holiday party.
[00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:28.354]  Maybe it was called a Christmas party.
[00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:30.755]  I mean, there's so many potential triggers here.
[00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:37.949]  We've seen groups like ISIS brag about how they use open immigration policies to sneak their militants into various nations.
[00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.174]  In reaction to this, many United States governors have said that they're not going to accept refugees into their respective states.
[00:00:44.574 --> 00:00:59.765]  Now we know not all refugees are terrorists, we know most refugees are not militants, but with the flimsy excuse of a Christmas tree or Christmas decorations that set this guy off, we're going to ask the people here at UT, should we ban religious festivities on public universities?
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.923]  We're asking people if religious holidays should be allowed on public universities.
[00:01:04.623 --> 00:01:05.144]  Definitely.
[00:01:06.445 --> 00:01:08.426]  Religious holidays should be allowed in public universities?
[00:01:08.446 --> 00:01:09.027]  I think so.
[00:01:09.347 --> 00:01:16.633]  You mean like they should celebrate Christmas in a classroom or just set up like Christmas decorations on the sidewalk?
[00:01:16.653 --> 00:01:18.594]  Set up Christmas decorations on the sidewalk?
[00:01:19.014 --> 00:01:19.655]  Yeah, for sure.
[00:01:19.675 --> 00:01:23.418]  So if they set up something like a Christmas tree or anything like that, would that offend you at all?
[00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:25.020]  No, it wouldn't offend me.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.861]  I think it's fine.
[00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:29.803]  So if they set up a Christmas tree or anything like that, that wouldn't offend you?
[00:01:30.184 --> 00:01:30.684]  No, not at all.
[00:01:31.785 --> 00:01:32.665]  It's all about respect.
[00:01:33.206 --> 00:01:37.289]  So if they set up a Christmas tree or something else out here, would that bother you at all?
[00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:38.830]  No, I think that'd be okay.
[00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.233]  So if somebody set up a Christmas tree out here, that wouldn't offend you at all?
[00:01:42.893 --> 00:01:43.534]  No, not the slightest.
[00:01:44.074 --> 00:01:50.699]  Because I don't know if you heard, many people are speculating that yesterday's very unfortunate shooting in San Bernardino was somehow religiously motivated.
[00:01:51.277 --> 00:02:01.745]  In California, but I feel like that's only relevant to like, only, there are a few outlier people who would actually go do this sort of thing, and I feel like it's more beneficial to let people celebrate their holidays.
[00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:03.366]  Thank you so much sir.
[00:02:03.587 --> 00:02:03.847]  Thank you.
