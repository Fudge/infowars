[00:00:00.626 --> 00:00:03.211]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:15.973 --> 00:00:16.813]  This is a show.
[00:00:17.274 --> 00:00:18.114]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.134 --> 00:00:18.995]  Not gonna want to miss.
[00:00:19.055 --> 00:00:20.135]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.816 --> 00:00:21.616]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.376 --> 00:00:23.297]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.937 --> 00:00:27.559]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:32.221]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:35.323]  Well, we've done it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:35.983 --> 00:00:38.405]  We have broken the code on Jane Helm.
[00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:40.766]  A three-month investigative
[00:00:41.952 --> 00:00:45.715]  Foray into the documents, into the research, and into our sources.
[00:00:46.496 --> 00:00:47.877]  That's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:00:47.957 --> 00:00:50.620]  Phyllis Schlafly joining us as well on the open border move.
[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.543]  And they're going to be back this week with the TPP in Congress.
[00:00:54.603 --> 00:00:56.105]  Here is the investigative report.
[00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:07.753]  Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions warns there will be another attempt in Congress on Tuesday to push through TAA and Fast Track Authority.
[00:01:07.893 --> 00:01:17.078]  If that happens, it will empower the President to form a Pacific Union encompassing 40% of the world's economy and 12 nations, each with one equal vote.
[00:01:17.498 --> 00:01:31.645]  Once the union is formed, foreign bureaucrats will be required to meet regularly to write the Commission's rules, regulations, and directives, impacting American jobs, wages, and sovereignty, Sessions said in a statement posted on his Senate webpage.
[00:01:32.106 --> 00:01:38.729]  The Trade Adjustment Assistance, or the TAA, would allegedly protect workers from the consequences of the TPA fast track.
[00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:48.153]  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and House Speaker John Boehner crafted TAA as a compromise to nudge Democrats who fear a backlash from constituents.
[00:01:48.393 --> 00:01:57.217]  TAA, however, would not protect workers as transnational corporations continue to pillage industries and move jobs offshore under TPA and Fast Track.
[00:01:57.837 --> 00:02:06.599]  Sessions writes, Fast Track will not only apply to the Pacific Union, but can expedite an unlimited number of yet unseen international compacts for six years.
[00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:20.483]  There are already plans to advance through Fast Track, the trade in services agreement, the goal of which includes labor mobility among more than 50 nations, further eroding the ability of the American people to control their own affairs.
[00:02:20.743 --> 00:02:26.324]  The globalists are using trade deficits and labor mobility to further reduce wages of American workers.
[00:02:26.644 --> 00:02:31.928]  TPA would extend and increase the corrosive effect of job losses begun under NAFTA.
[00:02:32.208 --> 00:02:44.176]  Between 1979 and 1994, trade eliminated 2.4 million jobs in the U.S., wrote Robert E. Scott, an economist for the Economic Policy Institute, in 1998.
[00:02:44.616 --> 00:02:48.239]  Growing trade deficits were responsible for most of these job losses.
[00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:53.802]  Which were concentrated in manufacturing because most trade involves the sale of manufactured goods.
[00:02:54.122 --> 00:02:57.304]  NAFTA added to the flow of jobs out of the U.S.
[00:02:57.604 --> 00:03:01.126]  by encouraging firms to move production to Mexico and Canada.
[00:03:01.426 --> 00:03:06.369]  Our trade deficit with both countries increased from $16 billion in 1993 to $48 billion in 1996, in constant $1987.
[00:03:13.453 --> 00:03:13.973]  The U.S.
[00:03:14.054 --> 00:03:18.477]  lost 395,000 jobs as a result of the NAFTA deficits.
[00:03:19.018 --> 00:03:22.140]  Japan and Mexico eventually lost manufacturing to China.
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.402]  In 2013, the overall U.S.
[00:03:24.462 --> 00:03:28.105]  trade deficit with China expanded to 315 billion.
[00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.227]  That big drain tends to slow U.S.
[00:03:31.367 --> 00:03:36.151]  economic growth at a time when our government debt is huge and unemployment is high.
[00:03:36.552 --> 00:03:42.677]  Establishment economists routinely state globalist free trade is healthy for the economy and creates domestic jobs.
[00:03:43.497 --> 00:03:51.360]  Former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for the Reagan Administration, Paul Craig Roberts wrote, The claim that jobs offshoring by U.S.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.622]  corporations increases domestic employment in the U.S.
[00:03:54.962 --> 00:03:57.583]  is one of the greatest hoaxes ever perpetrated.
[00:03:58.263 --> 00:04:01.825]  Over the last decade, the net new jobs created in the U.S.
[00:04:01.845 --> 00:04:04.826]  have nothing to do with the multinational corporations.
[00:04:05.106 --> 00:04:09.788]  The jobs consist of waitresses and bartenders, health care and social services,
[00:04:10.308 --> 00:04:13.931]  Retail clerks, and while the bubble lasted, construction.
[00:04:14.431 --> 00:04:18.274]  These are not the high-tech, high-paying jobs that the new economy promised.
[00:04:18.674 --> 00:04:22.537]  And they are not the jobs that can be associated with global corporations.
[00:04:23.018 --> 00:04:28.542]  Moreover, these domestic service jobs are themselves scarce, Sessions writes.
[00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:36.828]  While elites dream of a world without borders, voters dream of a world where the politicians they elect put this country's own citizens first.
[00:04:37.248 --> 00:04:47.771]  The movement among Americans toward a decent, honest populism, toward a refocusing on the needs of American citizens and American interests grows stronger by the day.
[00:04:48.231 --> 00:04:54.372]  Every vote to come before Congress, beginning with the next fast-track push, will face this test.
[00:04:54.993 --> 00:05:02.094]  Does your plan strengthen or weaken the social and economic position of the loyal, everyday, working American?
[00:05:02.374 --> 00:05:04.275]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:05:05.175 --> 00:05:07.077]  We'll be back with the full transmission.
[00:05:07.177 --> 00:05:08.639]  It's a special transmission.
[00:05:11.361 --> 00:05:22.792]  ISIS, blatantly supported by John McCain and the Pentagon, and hesitantly supplied tanks, rocket launchers, missile and anti-aircraft systems in accidental airdrops.
[00:05:23.253 --> 00:05:27.197]  Just sending arms, very frankly, although they need them very badly.
[00:05:27.237 --> 00:05:29.319]  They need anti-tank and anti-air weapons.
[00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:34.383]  ...is not going to change the situation on the ground and the massacre goes on.
[00:05:34.583 --> 00:05:41.749]  Now it has been confirmed that ISIS has stockpiled enough radioactive material to create weapons of mass destruction.
[00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:56.100]  In the ISIS magazine Dabiq, ISIS declared their intent to acquire a nuclear warhead from Pakistan with their billions of stolen funds, gobbled up as they ransacked banks and took control of oil fields across Iraq and Syria.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:06.013]  ISIS claims that all they have to do is call on their leaders in Pakistan to purchase a nuclear device through weapons dealers with links to corrupt officials in the region.
[00:06:06.093 --> 00:06:08.116]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:06:09.713 --> 00:06:26.132]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[00:06:26.393 --> 00:06:29.897]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[00:06:30.217 --> 00:06:33.881]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[00:06:34.122 --> 00:06:35.523]  Hdfirearms.com.
[00:06:35.824 --> 00:06:39.027]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs and Special Ops people.
[00:06:39.127 --> 00:06:44.033]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[00:06:44.273 --> 00:06:45.094]  It's always about security.
[00:06:45.094 --> 00:06:45.494]  I think so.
[00:07:09.557 --> 00:07:15.022]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:07:15.303 --> 00:07:29.757]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:07:30.017 --> 00:07:37.821]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:07:38.021 --> 00:07:43.463]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:07:43.583 --> 00:07:46.945]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:07:47.145 --> 00:07:51.127]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:07:51.267 --> 00:07:55.149]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:07:55.629 --> 00:07:55.889]  I think so.
[00:08:21.847 --> 00:08:23.988]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:24.468 --> 00:08:25.908]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.448 --> 00:08:38.030]  Phyllis Schlafly, pretty much the founder of what became the libertarian constitutional movement in this country.
[00:08:39.391 --> 00:08:50.773]  You could argue maybe Barry Goldwater's the real founder, but she is the progenitor of the youth movement that became the modern constitutional slash libertarian movement.
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:09:09.904]  She will be joining us, no longer a young woman, coming up at the start of the next hour to talk TPP and Hillary's plan to win the presidency by stuffing ballot boxes with illegal aliens voting, being given voter ID cards, driver's license, you name it.
[00:09:10.024 --> 00:09:11.525]  Simply outrageous.
[00:09:14.325 --> 00:09:19.907]  Then at the bottom of the next hour, we're going to be joined by Rob Dew in studio, back from Bilderberg.
[00:09:21.513 --> 00:09:31.697]  to get his reflections on the Globalist Confab and how much exposure took place this year, a big victory for the people, and Paul Watson from London joining us via Skype.
[00:09:34.418 --> 00:09:49.705]  Then we have Dr. Edward Group joining us to take your questions, your comments, and to talk about really something that's revolutionary, that's undoubtedly the most dramatic one-time health
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:51.780]  We're good to go.
[00:10:20.549 --> 00:10:25.191]  And about 98% of people that do it have the same results.
[00:10:26.051 --> 00:10:31.293]  If you don't have the results, you have got a major problem.
[00:10:37.576 --> 00:10:46.179]  And I never do cliffhangers, but I don't want to get into it now because I've gotten to the point of talking about it, and I really don't want to.
[00:10:48.035 --> 00:10:49.696]  And I wanted to kind of write some notes up.
[00:10:49.756 --> 00:10:58.364]  I've been procrastinating about how I want to get into this, but it's dramatic, and it's inexpensive, and it's easy.
[00:11:02.127 --> 00:11:07.251]  In fact, you can do this without ever buying anything from InfowarsStore.com.
[00:11:07.852 --> 00:11:10.374]  So it's not a pitch, but it is a pitch.
[00:11:12.205 --> 00:11:15.987]  And when I heard this six months ago, and did this, I mean, I rolled my eyes.
[00:11:16.027 --> 00:11:16.948]  I said, yeah, right.
[00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:18.129]  Yeah, right.
[00:11:19.309 --> 00:11:19.630]  Sure.
[00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:26.274]  Even though I trusted Anthony Ucciardi and Dr. Group and others, and people told me, oh yeah, you haven't heard of that?
[00:11:26.814 --> 00:11:32.277]  And then when I did it, it was like, six, seven days in, I'm like, well, I hadn't seen this happen yet.
[00:11:33.418 --> 00:11:34.079]  And then it happened.
[00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:39.302]  I'm gonna leave it there until the third hour.
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.881]  Everybody's been talking about the bad feeling they've got.
[00:11:46.382 --> 00:11:49.583]  The feeling of wanting to do something, the feeling of wanting to fix things.
[00:11:50.183 --> 00:11:58.706]  It's never been more intense, not just with myself, but my family, everyone I know, people at grocery stores, people at restaurants, people at church, people that don't know who I am.
[00:11:59.447 --> 00:12:01.247]  George Norrie was on yesterday talking about it.
[00:12:01.728 --> 00:12:02.928]  He's been feeling it for years.
[00:12:03.068 --> 00:12:04.029]  It's intensifying.
[00:12:04.609 --> 00:12:05.149]  What is it?
[00:12:06.549 --> 00:12:07.530]  It's the threat of World War III.
[00:12:09.736 --> 00:12:13.719]  The head general of NATO says they're preparing for open war with Russia.
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.842]  That's never happened in the history of NATO.
[00:12:18.163 --> 00:12:27.852]  We have Pat Buchanan out in his syndicated column saying his third world is a third world war inevitable.
[00:12:30.865 --> 00:12:35.689]  He has another article on, is a third world America inevitable that ties into all that.
[00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:37.511]  Continuing, U.S.
[00:12:37.591 --> 00:12:42.254]  may send F-22 fighter jets to Europe to counter Russian threat.
[00:12:42.895 --> 00:12:43.696]  A senior U.S.
[00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:51.062]  Air Force official called the current situation with Russia the biggest threat on her mind.
[00:12:52.329 --> 00:12:53.570]  It's funny with this Buchanan story.
[00:12:53.870 --> 00:13:05.237]  I saw a story he did a few weeks ago about the situation with Russia and how it could lead to war, and then I was trying to search it and print it, and then printed the wrong one about is America becoming third world, and I read the headline and was confused.
[00:13:05.877 --> 00:13:07.138]  But here are the Russian articles.
[00:13:08.139 --> 00:13:09.179]  The Moscow Times.
[00:13:09.319 --> 00:13:12.361]  Putin says Russia is beefing up its nuclear arsenal.
[00:13:13.662 --> 00:13:14.903]  Here's another story out of RT.
[00:13:15.363 --> 00:13:15.663]  U.S.
[00:13:15.703 --> 00:13:19.646]  may send F-22 fighter jets to Europe to counter Russian threat.
[00:13:21.567 --> 00:13:30.913]  Meanwhile, Obama has been bombing Libya to supposedly take out the leadership of the Wahhabist, Al Qaeda, ISIS radicals that they helped put in charge.
[00:13:31.694 --> 00:13:50.867]  And if you go back four and a half years ago, Hosni Mubarak, the American ally and leader, the dictator, but America's friend, who'd stabilized that country for 34 years, and Christians and Muslims could live side by side, Shiites and Sunnis could live side by side, and their economy was stabilized.
[00:13:51.638 --> 00:13:54.760]  In the most populous nation in the Middle East.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.901]  It's technically part of Africa.
[00:13:59.923 --> 00:14:13.030]  And he wouldn't go along with removing Muammar Gaddafi, who for eight years had invested in the West, opened up the West, apologized for stuff he did decades before, and basically tried to westernize.
[00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:18.113]  They set him up and now they admit that Libya is a failed state.
[00:14:20.313 --> 00:14:21.474]  They say it's an accident.
[00:14:21.554 --> 00:14:24.375]  No, the plan was to destabilize and wreck the country.
[00:14:24.395 --> 00:14:28.538]  And that's another thing Hillary Clinton oversaw and that she's quite proud of.
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:38.483]  So, meanwhile, there is a huge expansion of tanks and troops, U.S.
[00:14:38.523 --> 00:14:42.706]  military, piling in
[00:14:44.793 --> 00:14:47.436]  To Ukraine right now, with the U.S.
[00:14:47.496 --> 00:14:55.103]  Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Powers, giving very provocative speeches from Ukraine.
[00:14:57.205 --> 00:14:59.007]  It's really amazing to see this happening.
[00:14:59.507 --> 00:15:02.230]  We're going to be drilling more into that today.
[00:15:05.713 --> 00:15:07.996]  Speaking of Phyllis Schlafly coming up, 121 murders
[00:15:10.333 --> 00:15:15.176]  ...have been attributed to illegals released by Obama administration just in the last year.
[00:15:16.317 --> 00:15:19.039]  And that's just what they can attribute to it.
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:28.365]  Even bigger news, Obama pushes Internet ID verification in response to NSA hacking.
[00:15:28.405 --> 00:15:29.606]  We told you that was coming.
[00:15:30.401 --> 00:15:47.755]  For at least seven years, all new Microsoft software that connects to your keyboard has a thumbprint biometric identification system in it, and a lot of the keyboards already have it on it, but it's not been adopted because the public doesn't like it.
[00:15:49.122 --> 00:16:01.170]  But the global move from China to the United States, from Germany to Australia, is an internet ID that's biometrically accessed either by face print, voice print, or thumb, or index finger print.
[00:16:02.451 --> 00:16:05.713]  And then once they have that, internet taxes kick in.
[00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:08.255]  And then they can track everywhere you go.
[00:16:09.336 --> 00:16:17.161]  Then under TPP and other agreements, three strikes, no judge, no jury, corporate boards complain on you, like YouTube.
[00:16:18.715 --> 00:16:22.218]  You get three strikes on YouTube, you're banned.
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.662]  And already through Google ID, they can pretty much ban you.
[00:16:27.902 --> 00:16:33.166]  You've got to get somebody else to go log in with their Google ID to get a YouTube account for you.
[00:16:34.187 --> 00:16:37.049]  Well in the future, that won't be happening as easily.
[00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:43.014]  And people won't want to sign up on the internet for you because they know they can get the strikes.
[00:16:43.754 --> 00:16:45.115]  This is the global admitted plan.
[00:16:46.007 --> 00:16:47.788]  And they get this internet ID through?
[00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:52.411]  That is half the battle for them to end freedom on the web.
[00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:53.092]  I mean, it's here.
[00:16:53.952 --> 00:16:59.936]  Along with the FCC taking over, and along with the internet kill switches, I mean, it's all in place now.
[00:17:00.457 --> 00:17:01.497]  Now they just gotta sell it.
[00:17:02.978 --> 00:17:08.102]  How do you think when you're driving down the road, your GPS tells you if there's traffic up ahead, second to second now?
[00:17:09.682 --> 00:17:17.208]  It's wirelessly dialed in and is communicating with an international grid.
[00:17:17.489 --> 00:17:18.750]  Everything's being tracked.
[00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.913]  And it has wonderful, wonderful attributes to it.
[00:17:23.373 --> 00:17:24.915]  But it's all double-edged.
[00:17:24.975 --> 00:17:27.257]  It's a Trojan horse in the very classic sense.
[00:17:27.277 --> 00:17:28.338]  We're going to be breaking that down.
[00:17:29.819 --> 00:17:30.499]  Huge news.
[00:17:32.185 --> 00:17:34.946]  In fact, all the news is so incredible, I don't know what our top story is.
[00:17:35.286 --> 00:17:36.606]  Probably the Russia situation.
[00:17:37.006 --> 00:17:41.307]  Pope Francis warns of destruction of Earth's ecosystem in leaked encyclical.
[00:17:41.327 --> 00:17:42.188]  That broke yesterday.
[00:17:42.548 --> 00:17:43.528]  Now more of it's out.
[00:17:47.129 --> 00:17:49.229]  Obviously leaked on purpose to create a bunch of hype.
[00:17:49.269 --> 00:17:50.390]  Because, oh, it's leaked.
[00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:51.390]  It must be really interesting.
[00:17:55.128 --> 00:17:56.269]  We're going to be going over that.
[00:17:56.289 --> 00:17:59.112]  It's more class warfare from the Marxist.
[00:17:59.832 --> 00:18:01.454]  And I've never been a Catholic basher.
[00:18:02.014 --> 00:18:03.255]  I don't bash different religions.
[00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:04.537]  I don't bash different faiths.
[00:18:05.337 --> 00:18:06.679]  I've got a lot of Catholic friends.
[00:18:06.699 --> 00:18:11.123]  The Catholics I know are salt of the earth, libertarian, conservative, pro-life people.
[00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:20.812]  But this Pope is a world government promoting, anti-gun, global government, carbon tax guy, and it's sick.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.001]  And they had a coup to kick out the last pope using scandals.
[00:18:26.441 --> 00:18:29.823]  And they put this guy in and notice the socialist media suddenly loves him.
[00:18:30.243 --> 00:18:37.985]  He's creating class warfare and the fact that they put a pope in that's pushing basically communism shows you the globalists are moving into their endgame right now.
[00:18:39.046 --> 00:18:39.666]  That's coming up.
[00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.212]  And as far as I'm concerned, this pope needs an exorcism.
[00:18:43.852 --> 00:18:51.116]  Now, we're going to go ahead and play a trailer for some of the biggest breaking news we've ever had on Jade Helm.
[00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:52.757]  Investigative Report.
[00:18:52.817 --> 00:18:54.398]  Jade Helm mystery solved.
[00:18:54.938 --> 00:18:56.419]  That's going to air at the bottom of the hour.
[00:18:57.179 --> 00:19:03.004]  Three months of investigative research with our whole team, three weeks being put together by David Knight and Rob Jacobson.
[00:19:03.444 --> 00:19:07.747]  This is an investigative report in-depth, red-linked on InfoWars.com.
[00:19:07.967 --> 00:19:10.369]  We're going to premiere it coming up, but here is the trailer.
[00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:14.372]  Tonight, on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:19:15.533 --> 00:19:24.335]  A deep look into Jade Helm 15 and its historic connection into what Eisenhower called the scientific technological elite.
[00:19:24.615 --> 00:19:36.637]  We must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific technological elite.
[00:19:37.797 --> 00:19:41.157]  Is this just an exercise or is there more to it?
[00:19:41.998 --> 00:19:43.818]  What exactly is their agenda?
[00:19:45.086 --> 00:19:45.686]  Jade Helm 15.
[00:19:45.986 --> 00:19:51.208]  That's what the United States Army is calling a large-scale military exercise.
[00:19:51.529 --> 00:19:58.051]  InfoWars takes a hard look at the key players and facts behind the scenes of Jade Helm 15.
[00:19:58.491 --> 00:20:03.393]  Groups of these special forces can move around the civilian population without being noticed.
[00:20:03.673 --> 00:20:09.976]  We've cracked the code and are bringing you the answers tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:21:07.481 --> 00:21:08.042]  Don't wait.
[00:21:08.342 --> 00:21:09.243]  Call today.
[00:21:10.124 --> 00:21:16.330]  Usually, the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[00:21:16.871 --> 00:21:20.634]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[00:21:21.255 --> 00:21:24.217]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[00:21:24.758 --> 00:21:25.338]  Not fun.
[00:21:25.899 --> 00:21:33.685]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[00:21:34.285 --> 00:21:39.049]  One World Away is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[00:21:39.389 --> 00:21:40.190]  My name is Errol.
[00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:41.891]  I'm 74 years old.
[00:21:42.091 --> 00:21:44.492]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[00:21:44.653 --> 00:21:52.138]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your trace mineral supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[00:21:52.518 --> 00:21:58.582]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[00:21:58.822 --> 00:21:59.242]  Call 888-988-3325.
[00:21:59.302 --> 00:21:59.483]  That's 888-988-3325.
[00:21:59.503 --> 00:22:00.583]  Or visit oneworldwhey.com.
[00:22:09.395 --> 00:22:11.116]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[00:22:11.336 --> 00:22:14.658]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[00:22:14.958 --> 00:22:15.938]  A pair of scissors.
[00:22:16.318 --> 00:22:21.821]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[00:22:22.101 --> 00:22:26.763]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[00:22:27.023 --> 00:22:27.844]  The phone line.
[00:22:28.004 --> 00:22:32.926]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[00:22:33.266 --> 00:22:37.008]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[00:22:37.168 --> 00:22:40.071]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[00:22:40.491 --> 00:22:42.753]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[00:22:42.954 --> 00:22:47.158]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[00:22:47.298 --> 00:22:50.841]  Scissors can't cut it, and that means your home stays safe.

[00:23:02.432 --> 00:23:09.739]  Hey, Berky Guy here.
[00:23:09.819 --> 00:23:11.521]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[00:23:11.661 --> 00:23:13.363]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[00:23:13.403 --> 00:23:15.265]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?

[00:23:37.181 --> 00:23:38.161]  That's 877-886-3653.
[00:23:38.461 --> 00:23:47.186]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[00:23:47.346 --> 00:23:48.267]  Silver Lungs.
[00:23:48.467 --> 00:23:55.589]  With the addition of our unique lung delivery system, respiratory infections are targeted directly, where traditional oral administration simply cannot reach.
[00:23:55.749 --> 00:24:01.650]  This pioneering method also preserves the original particle sizes and delivers your silver solution directly into the bloodstream.
[00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:05.851]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and Lung Delivery System at SilverLungs.com.
[00:24:05.911 --> 00:24:07.632]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[00:24:10.009 --> 00:24:10.370]  I think?
[00:24:27.054 --> 00:24:29.296]  Again, the special report is now live.
[00:24:29.336 --> 00:24:32.439]  The video is now live for everybody to share with friends and family.
[00:24:32.539 --> 00:24:34.921]  We're going to air it, premiere it here on the radio.
[00:24:34.941 --> 00:24:37.343]  It was produced for the Nightly News.
[00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:43.648]  Coming up at the start of the next segment, investigative report, Jade Helm Mystery Solved.
[00:24:44.529 --> 00:24:53.156]  From their own documents going back over a decade, right up until now, voiced by Jakari Jackson, written by Rob Jacobson, the research,
[00:24:55.441 --> 00:24:58.563]  Was of course done by David Knight, Rob Jacobson, and the rest of the crew.
[00:24:59.183 --> 00:25:01.144]  Deep research into all of this.
[00:25:01.585 --> 00:25:06.368]  That is coming up in the next segment.
[00:25:07.548 --> 00:25:09.409]  Again, let me just give you the stacks here.
[00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:17.554]  More and more American citizens are being held for up to three years, black, white, and Hispanic.
[00:25:18.115 --> 00:25:21.457]  I point that out because this corruption in the government
[00:25:22.335 --> 00:25:27.922]  The corruption in the judiciary, the breakdown of the system is targeting everyone.
[00:25:28.262 --> 00:25:33.329]  The media wants to make it racial so we all fight with each other and don't ever fix it.
[00:25:34.871 --> 00:25:39.817]  But I'm going to get to this report after our Jade Helm report that's coming up.
[00:25:41.581 --> 00:25:48.384]  And it goes beyond Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, the Senators, pushing for a ban on indefinite detention of U.S.
[00:25:48.424 --> 00:25:51.666]  citizens at foreign ghost sites, or black sites.
[00:25:52.206 --> 00:25:58.288]  What about what's happening right here in America, within the normal court system?
[00:25:58.389 --> 00:25:59.729]  It is shocking.
[00:26:00.349 --> 00:26:02.010]  Ron Paul's got an article out today.
[00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.111]  In fact, I read it this morning.
[00:26:04.151 --> 00:26:05.031]  I didn't see it in the stack.
[00:26:05.072 --> 00:26:05.712]  It's probably here.
[00:26:07.841 --> 00:26:13.984]  Where he's talking about how the death penalty is the biggest example of our broken big government.
[00:26:15.585 --> 00:26:17.666]  I am inherently for an eye for an eye.
[00:26:19.547 --> 00:26:24.409]  And we see somebody murder someone live on television, we know they did it, or in front of a hundred witnesses, sure.
[00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:30.072]  But it turns out over a third of the people with DNA testing on death rows around the country are innocent!
[00:26:32.453 --> 00:26:35.575]  Remember the Michael Mortensen case here in Central Texas?
[00:26:36.616 --> 00:26:43.399]  Where they knew he was innocent and knew who killed his wife, but they just put the dad with no criminal record in prison?
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:50.502]  They've now indicted the former prosecutor up in Williamson County that did it?
[00:26:50.582 --> 00:26:55.024]  I mean, why would you want to put some innocent family man in jail for 25 years?
[00:26:58.868 --> 00:27:01.429]  He had a life sentence, spent 25 years.
[00:27:01.509 --> 00:27:02.549]  They knew who did it.
[00:27:02.709 --> 00:27:03.809]  They had the bandana.
[00:27:04.049 --> 00:27:05.470]  They had witnesses.
[00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:07.270]  They knew who killed his wife.
[00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:11.131]  Because I'm telling you, that serial killer ended up killing more people.
[00:27:11.471 --> 00:27:13.952]  I bet you money he was working for the man.
[00:27:16.332 --> 00:27:18.453]  So you want me to tell you my problems with the government?
[00:27:18.533 --> 00:27:19.173]  I'm gonna tell you.
[00:27:19.873 --> 00:27:21.974]  People think, what are you doing not wanting a war with the police?
[00:27:22.034 --> 00:27:23.034]  Why are you defending the system?
[00:27:23.314 --> 00:27:23.894]  I'm not!
[00:27:24.674 --> 00:27:27.095]  But you don't attack the bottom of it!
[00:27:28.837 --> 00:27:33.418]  When most of the police are innocent, you go after the people twisting the system!
[00:27:34.859 --> 00:27:36.359]  That's why you get things changed.
[00:27:36.839 --> 00:27:45.682]  Why do you think the controlled media is pushing that the police are the problem, and basically the only problem, and the feds are going to save us, because they're the engineers of the whole stinking thing?
[00:27:46.082 --> 00:27:47.102]  You want to fix it?
[00:27:47.742 --> 00:27:48.702]  We're going to break that down.
[00:27:51.563 --> 00:27:53.884]  But the system is corrupt.
[00:27:55.244 --> 00:27:57.925]  Undoubtedly one of the most corrupt in history, and it's getting worse.
[00:27:59.977 --> 00:28:00.857]  So that's coming up.
[00:28:00.877 --> 00:28:04.358]  We're going to get into the Pope and his carbon taxes.
[00:28:05.358 --> 00:28:06.999]  World government is what this is.
[00:28:08.579 --> 00:28:10.279]  We're in dire straits, folks.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.041]  Notice that the mainline Protestant groups are coming out pushing all sorts of tyranny.
[00:28:15.441 --> 00:28:17.821]  Notice the Catholic Church is pushing all sorts of tyranny.
[00:28:18.301 --> 00:28:20.742]  Notice all these Republican leaders are pushing tyranny.
[00:28:21.102 --> 00:28:24.543]  The New World Order is making its move right now.
[00:28:25.936 --> 00:28:31.339]  To dissolve borders, to create international government, with international taxes, and international armies.
[00:28:32.339 --> 00:28:35.301]  We may have read about this before in something called Revelation.
[00:28:38.903 --> 00:28:39.743]  Look at these headlines.
[00:28:39.883 --> 00:28:43.105]  Why the Pope's New Climate Change Doctrine Matters.
[00:28:43.945 --> 00:28:46.347]  And it's a new indulgence.
[00:28:47.227 --> 00:28:54.931]  Where you basically pay the big mega-banks, your carbon credits, so you can get into environmentalist heaven.
[00:28:58.823 --> 00:29:04.707]  And the Catholic Church puts out these memos saying, you know, give money and then we'll give money to save the earth.
[00:29:05.527 --> 00:29:12.011]  I mean, it's pay the church and we'll wave a magic wand and get your family out of purgatory.
[00:29:13.872 --> 00:29:18.595]  Because they're trapped in purgatory awaiting the hour of reprisal!
[00:29:18.935 --> 00:29:22.518]  And the time slips away!
[00:29:25.319 --> 00:29:26.040]  Give me a break.
[00:29:28.925 --> 00:29:33.531]  And this diverts from the massive destruction of the Earth that's taking place.
[00:29:34.953 --> 00:29:37.337]  And I meant to have more measured words, but man, I tell ya.
[00:29:39.164 --> 00:29:44.448]  I'm not a Catholic and I'm not a rocket scientist, but I have read Catholic canon law and studied it.
[00:29:44.948 --> 00:29:48.011]  It's against Catholic law to have a Jesuit as the Pope.
[00:29:48.031 --> 00:29:53.074]  Because it's supposed to be the police of the church, so you don't want them taking over.
[00:29:53.455 --> 00:29:55.156]  Like Julius Caesar taking over Rome.
[00:29:55.796 --> 00:29:56.437]  Same story.
[00:29:57.097 --> 00:29:58.598]  It's like having the military take over.
[00:29:59.179 --> 00:30:00.060]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.161]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.102 --> 00:30:05.804]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.958 --> 00:30:16.400]  Minority Report style policing is here, with the article, Police Release Pre-Crime Smartphone App.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:25.683]  Swiss police have released a pre-crime smartphone app, which warns users about crimes before they are committed, based on criminal prediction software.
[00:30:26.103 --> 00:30:36.667]  And across the world as well, numerous police departments in the US are also using similar technology, such as the Miami Police Department, which has adopted prediction software.
[00:30:37.407 --> 00:30:40.308]  And understandably, the app has some people concerned.
[00:30:40.749 --> 00:30:53.634]  We've heard stories of people driving off bridges and into bodies of water because their GPS app told them to do so, so it's very possible that you could be harassed just because you're in the wrong place at the wrong time.
[00:30:54.335 --> 00:31:03.479]  And contrast this with the Waze app, which among many other things allowed you to tag the locations of police officers, and many officers said that was unacceptable.
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:07.677]  You can find more reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:31:09.724 --> 00:31:12.946]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:31:13.246 --> 00:31:21.251]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:31:21.491 --> 00:31:26.515]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:31:26.915 --> 00:31:29.196]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:31:29.436 --> 00:31:31.238]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:31:39.677 --> 00:31:40.297]  Alex Jones here.
[00:31:40.698 --> 00:31:49.802]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:31:49.982 --> 00:31:53.444]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[00:32:09.452 --> 00:32:14.898]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:32:15.199 --> 00:32:29.655]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:32:29.895 --> 00:32:37.720]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:43.363]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:32:43.463 --> 00:32:46.865]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:32:47.045 --> 00:32:51.027]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:32:51.168 --> 00:32:55.030]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:59.475]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.

[00:33:23.826 --> 00:33:25.968]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:26.468 --> 00:33:33.092]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:33.112 --> 00:33:40.698]  I was born in the soul of misery and I never had me a name.
[00:33:40.758 --> 00:33:46.742]  They just give me a number when I
[00:33:51.032 --> 00:33:55.595]  To have microchip identification devices implanted into their body.
[00:33:56.456 --> 00:34:04.080]  Got a long line of heartache, I carry it well.
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:08.883]  The list of lives I've broken reach from here to hell.
[00:34:12.905 --> 00:34:16.888]  Bad luck wind been blowing at my back.
[00:34:20.695 --> 00:34:22.776]  I pray you don't look at me.
[00:34:22.997 --> 00:34:24.658]  I pray I don't look back.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:32.542]  I was born in the soul of misery.
[00:34:32.642 --> 00:34:33.783]  Monday through Friday.
[00:34:33.943 --> 00:34:36.044]  Never had me a name.
[00:34:36.164 --> 00:34:36.845]  From 11 a.m.
[00:34:36.885 --> 00:34:37.325]  to 2 p.m.
[00:34:37.365 --> 00:34:38.606]  Central Standard Time.
[00:34:38.626 --> 00:34:42.748]  They just gave me a number when I was young.
[00:34:42.868 --> 00:34:47.992]  InfoWars Nightly News at 7 o'clock Central as well and of course the Sunday show 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:34:48.052 --> 00:34:48.312]  live.
[00:34:49.505 --> 00:34:51.646]  I was live last Sunday, I'll be live this Sunday.
[00:34:52.266 --> 00:34:54.448]  Every three, four weeks or so, David Knight sits in.
[00:34:54.468 --> 00:34:58.169]  I don't think folks mind me taking a Sunday off once a month.
[00:35:01.371 --> 00:35:02.792]  The next hour's coming at us.
[00:35:03.332 --> 00:35:08.194]  Phyllis Schlafly's going to be on, the latest on TPP and the move to completely gut our borders.
[00:35:09.735 --> 00:35:14.858]  I want to get into Americans interned in America without trial.
[00:35:15.748 --> 00:35:18.710]  In fact, I forgot one that I didn't have you guys print off.
[00:35:19.431 --> 00:35:23.073]  There was the case of the dentist Charles Sell.
[00:35:25.335 --> 00:35:29.158]  And I was interviewing his lawyers like in 1998 and stuff.
[00:35:29.578 --> 00:35:31.700]  And last time I heard he was still in prison.
[00:35:33.861 --> 00:35:35.142]  And he never got a trial.
[00:35:36.343 --> 00:35:39.626]  They claimed he didn't get engaged in Medicare-Medicaid fraud as a dentist.
[00:35:40.286 --> 00:35:41.207]  He said he hadn't.
[00:35:42.469 --> 00:35:45.650]  And then they threw him in a psychiatric prison, then put him in a regular prison.
[00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:49.111]  And last time I checked, he'd been there like 16, 17 years.
[00:35:49.671 --> 00:35:52.412]  And the New York Times had articles about it, like it was good.
[00:35:52.552 --> 00:35:53.852]  Like, this is good.
[00:35:53.972 --> 00:35:55.693]  We just put you directly in prison.
[00:35:56.573 --> 00:35:57.133]  It's liberal.
[00:35:59.474 --> 00:35:59.994]  Now there it is.
[00:36:00.294 --> 00:36:03.375]  Jailed man fights efforts to medicate him for trial.
[00:36:05.356 --> 00:36:09.458]  And it just went on for decades because he wouldn't let them medicate him for trial.
[00:36:09.798 --> 00:36:12.900]  Then they finally medicated him so much that he's a zombie.
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:14.301]  Last time I had his lawyer on.
[00:36:15.241 --> 00:36:16.161]  No criminal record.
[00:36:16.221 --> 00:36:17.082]  Done nothing wrong.
[00:36:19.383 --> 00:36:20.264]  Fought their charges.
[00:36:20.284 --> 00:36:21.404]  They just said, you're mentally ill.
[00:36:21.424 --> 00:36:21.844]  Goodbye.
[00:36:22.265 --> 00:36:23.985]  I mean, there's so many examples of this.
[00:36:24.746 --> 00:36:25.706]  And there's some new ones.
[00:36:26.947 --> 00:36:28.107]  Kalief Browder.
[00:36:29.268 --> 00:36:30.249]  No criminal record.
[00:36:30.329 --> 00:36:32.069]  They claimed he stole a backpack.
[00:36:32.109 --> 00:36:32.770]  Had no evidence.
[00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:34.591]  Three years in a prison.
[00:36:35.666 --> 00:36:39.308]  Without a trial, he got out and committed suicide.
[00:36:40.389 --> 00:36:42.570]  Man left in solitary confinement for two years.
[00:36:44.631 --> 00:36:46.452]  No judge, no jury, no arraignment.
[00:36:48.413 --> 00:36:51.255]  They never let him leave the cell for two years either.
[00:36:52.416 --> 00:36:55.637]  He looked like a guy, you know, out of those old movies where they're locked up in the dungeon.
[00:36:56.698 --> 00:36:59.760]  They just pulled him over in the town in New Mexico.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.980]  He's white, by the way.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.241]  Most of these people are white.
[00:37:03.082 --> 00:37:05.343]  And my issue is, it's happened to everybody.
[00:37:09.445 --> 00:37:11.606]  Putin says Russia's beefing up its nuclear arsenal.
[00:37:13.087 --> 00:37:13.927]  That's all coming up.
[00:37:14.808 --> 00:37:16.289]  We've got a bunch of news on the economy.
[00:37:16.929 --> 00:37:18.430]  Fed's worst nightmare, the ghost of 1937.
[00:37:19.691 --> 00:37:22.232]  CNBC reporting on possible crash coming.
[00:37:22.873 --> 00:37:24.174]  I'm going to talk about this shark attack.
[00:37:24.274 --> 00:37:31.638]  Somebody asked me last night on the street, they said, I've been listening to your show, you know, Sunday and today, and you never talk about the shark attacks.
[00:37:32.219 --> 00:37:33.800]  Well, I just don't talk about stuff that doesn't matter.
[00:37:34.682 --> 00:37:42.726]  I know it's sensational that two people got mauled in North Carolina by probably some mentally ill shark, because normal sharks don't attack people.
[00:37:43.146 --> 00:37:45.347]  There's less than 100 attacks worldwide every year.
[00:37:45.787 --> 00:37:52.871]  Five deaths from great whites, six or seven from bull sharks, three or four from makos, a couple from tigers.
[00:37:53.451 --> 00:37:56.572]  You're talking less than 20 deaths a year out of seven and a half billion people.
[00:37:56.993 --> 00:38:01.775]  You've got a better chance of seeing a leprechaun riding a pink pony than you do getting bit by a shark.
[00:38:02.995 --> 00:38:07.477]  Now, you can get snapped by a black tip or something that thinks your foot's a fish and you have some teeth marks in it.
[00:38:07.497 --> 00:38:10.098]  I mean, stingrays kill hundreds of people a year.
[00:38:10.778 --> 00:38:16.060]  I mean, I'm not saying the ocean isn't dangerous, jellyfish and stuff, but I just am not into hype threats.
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:20.261]  Cancer viruses and vaccines?
[00:38:20.941 --> 00:38:21.401]  Look it up.
[00:38:21.481 --> 00:38:22.262]  Government admits.
[00:38:22.382 --> 00:38:24.682]  I even saw it on WebMD like a week ago.
[00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:28.043]  I think it was Dew in the back office was showing me.
[00:38:28.063 --> 00:38:28.524]  Have you seen this?
[00:38:28.544 --> 00:38:29.384]  I was like, yeah, I've seen that.
[00:38:30.764 --> 00:38:39.346]  100 plus million people were given cancer viruses in the polio shot and they estimate that almost all of them developed cancer and most of them died from it.
[00:38:40.306 --> 00:38:42.626]  All these cancers didn't exist, they're now coming.
[00:38:43.507 --> 00:38:45.407]  Cancer viruses!
[00:38:45.907 --> 00:38:47.407]  Most cancer is viral.
[00:38:48.328 --> 00:38:54.669]  Your body fights it off, you finally give in, you finally give up,
[00:38:56.138 --> 00:38:58.119]  That's why taking steroids for allergies is so dangerous.
[00:38:58.139 --> 00:38:58.879]  I've been reading studies.
[00:38:59.179 --> 00:39:00.940]  Yeah, it'll make you not have allergies.
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.622]  The problem is that's your body fighting all this toxic stuff.
[00:39:03.822 --> 00:39:05.362]  You suppress that, your body gives up.
[00:39:05.823 --> 00:39:07.043]  Boom, cancer starts growing.
[00:39:07.343 --> 00:39:08.244]  You're deader than a hammer.
[00:39:10.265 --> 00:39:11.825]  I mean, we're under total attack.
[00:39:12.086 --> 00:39:13.266]  You see allergies going way up?
[00:39:13.326 --> 00:39:14.647]  That's our body just freaking out.
[00:39:14.987 --> 00:39:15.867]  Going, I gotta fight!
[00:39:16.007 --> 00:39:16.508]  I gotta fight!
[00:39:16.648 --> 00:39:17.548]  I gotta fight for my life!
[00:39:17.708 --> 00:39:18.208]  I gotta fight!
[00:39:18.348 --> 00:39:18.789]  I gotta fight!
[00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:20.249]  Finally, it goes, I give up.
[00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:21.410]  Get cancer.
[00:39:24.278 --> 00:39:25.479]  We're in a fight for our lives.
[00:39:25.499 --> 00:39:25.959]  I'm sorry.
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:27.781]  I'm not scared.
[00:39:27.801 --> 00:39:34.627]  A family of mine will just freak out when I'll just go swim in the Caribbean Ocean at night.
[00:39:37.029 --> 00:39:40.051]  What are you doing swimming 200 yards out in the Caribbean at night?
[00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:43.194]  Because I like it.
[00:39:44.475 --> 00:39:45.296]  I'm not scared.
[00:39:45.736 --> 00:39:47.558]  I know statistically it's not a danger.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.981]  I get on the highway every day with giant trucks and cars all around me.
[00:39:53.481 --> 00:39:56.382]  The number one cause of death under the age of about 60.
[00:39:57.423 --> 00:39:58.803]  And we all do it with our kids.
[00:39:59.523 --> 00:40:00.543]  It's super dangerous.
[00:40:00.563 --> 00:40:03.424]  Those big 18-wheelers are a lot more dangerous than a Mako.
[00:40:04.665 --> 00:40:06.165]  Well, my son caught a 7-footer, though.
[00:40:06.445 --> 00:40:09.166]  You pull it up on my Twitter, and you talk about scary.
[00:40:09.746 --> 00:40:11.147]  That sucker was beautiful, too.
[00:40:11.167 --> 00:40:17.489]  Had, like, blue, almost black-colored skin, scales.
[00:40:19.076 --> 00:40:20.378]  Just so beautiful, that color.
[00:40:20.398 --> 00:40:21.500]  I'd love to have a car that color.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:22.742]  And then white on the bottom.
[00:40:23.203 --> 00:40:25.046]  Just a beautiful, beautiful shark.
[00:40:25.106 --> 00:40:27.390]  Except for the face is just demonically evil.
[00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:29.273]  Just teeth poking out in every direction.
[00:40:30.915 --> 00:40:31.456]  He gaffed it.
[00:40:32.779 --> 00:40:33.059]  I don't know.
[00:40:50.623 --> 00:41:03.554]  But it releases ancestral memories and chemicals in the brain when you hunt and take down predators and it activates you and that way you transcend being a boy and become a man.
[00:41:03.854 --> 00:41:05.435]  That's what these rituals are all about.
[00:41:05.716 --> 00:41:07.617]  We don't go out and kill animals we'd like to kill.
[00:41:07.897 --> 00:41:13.142]  We go out to do it because you get high when you do it because you're designed to do it.
[00:41:16.189 --> 00:41:18.149]  And then after you've done it a bunch, you have no more desire to do it.
[00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:19.050]  I really don't have any desire.
[00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:21.690]  I like to go out dove hunting and then shoot quail.
[00:41:24.951 --> 00:41:28.052]  Quail dove hunting, because then you can go marinate them and then cook them that evening.
[00:41:30.393 --> 00:41:32.913]  And then it's just the skill of shooting them out of the air, and they're like roaches.
[00:41:33.433 --> 00:41:35.474]  I mean, you know, there's so many of them.
[00:41:36.654 --> 00:41:40.975]  But this demonization of hunting is about a demonization of normal human activities.
[00:41:41.895 --> 00:41:43.356]  But I've now segwayed
[00:41:44.733 --> 00:41:47.158]  Out of where I was going, we're going to skip this network break coming up.
[00:41:47.438 --> 00:41:57.136]  The only one I'm going to skip today so that we can air this exclusive, in-depth report compiled by Rob Jacobson, Jakari Jackson,
[00:41:58.988 --> 00:42:00.209]  David Knight and others.
[00:42:00.229 --> 00:42:10.716]  This is a compendium of three months of research into Jade Helm, our sources, but government documents and their own admissions, and it's not an imminent takeover.
[00:42:10.876 --> 00:42:16.019]  It is a slow, creeping death to model every facet of society.
[00:42:16.379 --> 00:42:18.501]  It's red-linked on InfoWars.com.
[00:42:19.021 --> 00:42:23.784]  It is such an important report, investigative report, Jade Helm, mystery solved.
[00:42:24.425 --> 00:42:25.525]  We're going to tweet it.
[00:42:25.586 --> 00:42:26.746]  We're going to put it on Facebook.
[00:42:26.806 --> 00:42:27.547]  Please share it.
[00:42:29.048 --> 00:42:29.768]  It is solved.
[00:42:29.828 --> 00:42:32.429]  We can say 100% it's solved.
[00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:35.771]  Will they piggyback some false flags on the back of it?
[00:42:36.471 --> 00:42:36.811]  Maybe.
[00:42:39.592 --> 00:42:45.334]  But overall, it's about mapping human behavior and conditioning the public to accept military occupation.
[00:42:45.695 --> 00:42:50.917]  Here is the in-depth, excellent report.
[00:42:51.417 --> 00:42:53.978]  Three months of research, three weeks in the making.
[00:42:56.661 --> 00:43:00.024]  And it's an excellent report visually in the graphics, but that's not what's important.
[00:43:00.384 --> 00:43:03.806]  It's the content, the information, the intel.
[00:43:06.288 --> 00:43:08.430]  Christ talked about pearls before swine.
[00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:14.234]  You ever given people gifts, or given people jobs, or given people opportunities and they don't appreciate or understand what they've been given?
[00:43:15.415 --> 00:43:17.496]  I know most of you appreciate what's happening.
[00:43:18.077 --> 00:43:19.258]  I need to appreciate more.
[00:43:20.475 --> 00:43:34.888]  How hardcore all this is, and how important InfoWars' position is, and the responsibility we have to quote the Marvel Comics character's uncle, Spider-Man's uncle, with great power comes great responsibility.
[00:43:36.009 --> 00:43:39.112]  That's actually an Eisenhower quote, a Patton quote.
[00:43:39.192 --> 00:43:40.653]  No one knows who originally said it.
[00:43:40.913 --> 00:43:42.375]  It goes back to Roman times.
[00:43:42.755 --> 00:43:45.858]  With great power comes great responsibility.
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:56.087]  Because the bigger your power reach is, the more unexact your delivery is, and the more damage you can create.
[00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:04.495]  Spider-Man thought it was cute, letting the robber rob the promoter that had robbed him.
[00:44:05.156 --> 00:44:09.260]  He thought another wrong would make a right, and ended up getting his uncle killed.
[00:44:10.848 --> 00:44:17.935]  Voltaire, of course, is originally quoted as writing it when the printing press got going, but again, it goes back to Roman times.
[00:44:18.215 --> 00:44:21.258]  He undoubtedly translated it out of Latin.
[00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:24.662]  With great power comes great responsibility.
[00:44:24.682 --> 00:44:26.283]  In fact, let's give the actual Voltaire quote.
[00:44:26.984 --> 00:44:27.624]  The philosopher.
[00:44:28.966 --> 00:44:31.088]  With great power comes great responsibility.
[00:44:32.762 --> 00:44:33.983]  And that's what this comes down to.
[00:44:34.303 --> 00:44:36.344]  We need to appreciate the shows on the air.
[00:44:36.524 --> 00:44:37.124]  I know I do.
[00:44:37.625 --> 00:44:39.246]  I appreciate you, the listeners, supporting us.
[00:44:39.366 --> 00:44:40.186]  It's just incredible.
[00:44:40.266 --> 00:44:40.706]  Thank you.
[00:44:42.427 --> 00:44:47.670]  Every time I run into some sparkly-eyed family of just awake, lovely people, it is humbling.
[00:44:48.051 --> 00:44:55.615]  When we went out to the abortion protests and I met all these people of every race, color, and creed who love life and stand against evil, it was humbling.
[00:44:56.519 --> 00:45:02.822]  To see the goodness and the love and the understanding and the compassion in your eyes versus the eyes of our enemies.
[00:45:03.902 --> 00:45:05.483]  They were filled with weakness and hatred.
[00:45:08.644 --> 00:45:12.766]  Our enemies literally climbing into dumpsters to run from us.
[00:45:12.826 --> 00:45:13.847]  I mean, it was just epic.
[00:45:14.487 --> 00:45:14.887]  Biblical.
[00:45:15.728 --> 00:45:16.228]  Legendary.
[00:45:17.517 --> 00:45:21.079]  With them hissing that they love Satan and want to kill their children.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.642]  And just, I've killed 50, I love it!
[00:45:25.042 --> 00:45:29.665]  You go to the Capitol in plain clothes, clean-cut women just suddenly start chanting, Satan!
[00:45:29.725 --> 00:45:31.206]  Satan!
[00:45:32.007 --> 00:45:33.928]  I mean, this is their sacrament.
[00:45:33.968 --> 00:45:35.890]  We're fighting the devil.
[00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:42.754]  Whether it's archetypal, interdimensional, you know, the Catholic Church says they're going to have an exorcism over Mexico.
[00:45:43.895 --> 00:45:45.136]  The demons have taken over.
[00:45:47.483 --> 00:45:50.924]  Whether it's physical demons or not, demons have taken over.
[00:45:53.844 --> 00:45:54.664]  I need to repent.
[00:45:55.204 --> 00:45:56.045]  We need to repent.
[00:45:56.105 --> 00:46:07.567]  We need to get in that quiet place of the Most High that David talks about and really gauge where the world is and where we're going because we're cruising towards World War III.
[00:46:07.867 --> 00:46:14.208]  We're cruising towards real environmental degradation and collapse, not from carbon, but from GMO and the rest of it.
[00:46:16.084 --> 00:46:22.646]  We're going to go ahead and go to this powerful report, investigative report, Jade Helm Mystery Solved.
[00:46:24.126 --> 00:46:25.866]  Incredibly important intel.
[00:46:26.647 --> 00:46:27.167]  Get ready.
[00:46:27.827 --> 00:46:28.907]  Here is the facts.
[00:46:31.648 --> 00:46:35.369]  Videos on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:46:35.389 --> 00:46:36.129]  Spread it now!
[00:46:37.407 --> 00:46:38.628]  Jade Helm 15.
[00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:41.790]  A military exercise of grand scale.
[00:46:42.391 --> 00:46:45.653]  The military claims the exercise is for overseas training.
[00:46:46.254 --> 00:46:49.536]  Yet three of these United States have been listed as hostile.
[00:46:50.437 --> 00:46:57.322]  The term mastering the human domain reveals to us that Jade Helm 15 is more than just a military exercise.
[00:46:57.862 --> 00:47:01.765]  It's also an exercise of the new field of geospatial intelligence.
[00:47:02.345 --> 00:47:10.461]  Using human domain analytics to map the politics and thoughts of any nation, state, city, right down to the individual.
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.621]  Jade Helm 15.
[00:47:13.081 --> 00:47:17.544]  That's what the United States Army is calling a large-scale military exercise.
[00:47:17.984 --> 00:47:22.227]  Special Operations Command will be training with other armed units beginning in July.
[00:47:23.008 --> 00:47:32.754]  In a recent InfoWars.com report, Master the Human Domain, the domestic plan behind Jade Helm, we break down what the Jade Helm logo refers to.
[00:47:34.035 --> 00:47:38.940]  In brief, a new discipline in intelligence has been at center stage for the past decade.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.542]  Activity-Based Intelligence, or ABI.
[00:47:44.671 --> 00:48:07.721]  According to TrajectoryMagazine.com, the human domain or human dimension, which is a vital and integral part of ABI, is defined as the presence, activities including transactions both physical and virtual, culture, social structure, organization, networks and relationships, motivations, intent, vulnerabilities, and capabilities of humans.
[00:48:08.121 --> 00:48:16.071]  Single or groups across all domains of the operational environment, space, air, maritime, ground and cyber.
[00:48:16.812 --> 00:48:25.402]  This article goes on to say that the focus on mastering the human domain was born out of a merging of three already existing disciplines of intelligence.
[00:48:26.463 --> 00:48:29.246]  That may be the case for this branding of this idea.
[00:48:30.167 --> 00:48:39.717]  But the exercise of mapping the human domain right down to the individual is a long-standing institutionalized strategy that has been going on for well over 100 years.
[00:48:42.699 --> 00:48:58.393]  What reason would the United States government have to invest so much time, resources, and money in order to pinpoint exact pockets of thought in a country founded on free thought, expression, and most of all, outspoken words against its own government?
[00:48:59.702 --> 00:49:07.311]  During his famous farewell address, Eisenhower warned the American people of an imminent and internal threat, a scientific elite.
[00:49:07.891 --> 00:49:17.282]  We must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific elite.
[00:49:21.339 --> 00:49:30.865]  The title, Scientific Elite, to most Americans might seem like nothing more than ordinary intangible rhetoric, typically thrown around by politicians during their speeches.
[00:49:31.486 --> 00:49:35.388]  This time, however, Eisenhower was not speaking in abstractions.
[00:49:35.988 --> 00:49:38.190]  There actually is a scientific elite.
[00:49:41.187 --> 00:49:44.388]  Jade Helm 15 is anything but the American way.
[00:49:44.949 --> 00:49:49.651]  It's a domestic scientific control grid whose purpose is domination and control.
[00:49:51.091 --> 00:49:59.675]  A technological infrastructure for authoritarian political control is not the end goal, but a means to that end of eugenics.
[00:50:01.035 --> 00:50:26.282]  The term eugenics, coined by Charles Darwin's half-cousin Sir Francis Galton in 1883, is a science dedicated to the engineering of the human genome by selectively breeding those humans with what they consider to be desirable qualities, such as intelligence, athleticism, etc., and eliminating those humans without these attributes and all races of humans unlike their own.
[00:50:27.466 --> 00:50:30.427]  Out of this, race theory and race science was born.
[00:50:31.187 --> 00:50:42.229]  Carl Pearson, a protege of Galton, assembled a biometrics laboratory based out of the University of London in 1907 in order to collect data about people mostly based on race.
[00:50:42.749 --> 00:50:53.491]  He also published a journal entitled Biometrica, which became very influential with American scientists and financiers who were becoming extremely interested in the concept of eugenics.
[00:50:54.231 --> 00:50:59.813]  As this movement grew in popularity, top American industrialists threw their money into the game.
[00:51:00.153 --> 00:51:04.935]  Carnegie, Harriman, and Rockefeller were among the top contributors.
[00:51:05.595 --> 00:51:23.121]  California became the eugenics capital of the world, while on the East Coast, Cold Spring Harbor Research Facility, located on Long Island, was collecting and storing biometric information on average Americans in order to begin the elimination of families, as well as entire races of people.
[00:51:24.221 --> 00:51:36.948]  Through the efforts of the California eugenicist, mostly through written pamphlets and endowments mostly from the Rockefellers and Harriman, the eugenics movement found a second home in Germany in the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.
[00:51:38.269 --> 00:51:51.476]  This pre-World War II, well-funded, international scientific community based around the eugenics movement was cementing its place as a standard in human academia when World War II broke out in full scale.
[00:51:52.697 --> 00:51:58.160]  The then CEO of IBM, Thomas J. Watson, worked hand-in-hand with Nazi Germany.
[00:51:58.721 --> 00:52:18.893]  In 1933, it was Watson who enthusiastically helped the Nazi plan and funded their national census, which according to historian Edwin Black in his 2001 publication, IBM and the Holocaust, the 1933 census with design help and tabulation services provided by IBM through its German subsidiary.
[00:52:19.213 --> 00:52:32.158]  ...proved to be pivotal to the Nazis in their efforts to identify, isolate, and ultimately destroy the country's Jewish, Gypsy, and other minority communities, as well as single out political opposition.
[00:52:32.898 --> 00:52:39.161]  While much of the world was forever altered by the events of the war, this eugenics-based community remained together.
[00:52:39.921 --> 00:52:49.443]  A similar and frighteningly more advanced version of this eugenics-based biometrics program is being tested right now under the name Jade Helm 15.
[00:52:51.144 --> 00:52:58.666]  While the term eugenics is no longer used in the mainstream openly, the practice of eugenics is still around and stronger than ever.
[00:52:59.026 --> 00:53:05.107]  Jade Helm 15 exercises the next generation of technology in the political domination arena.
[00:53:05.407 --> 00:53:07.848]  It is simply another technological step
[00:53:08.288 --> 00:53:22.882]  Beyond the Cold Springs Harbor Research Facilities Biometrics Program, or Thomas J. Watson's Census of Germany, and their disciplines developed during the eugenics heyday in the early 20th century, are still being practiced in advance today.
[00:53:23.522 --> 00:53:40.493]  Mandatory toxic vaccines, abortion, family courts, contaminated water, and of course biometrics, are just a few of the branches that grew out of the original eugenics trunk, still present and dominating over our society today.
[00:53:41.794 --> 00:53:55.461]  In 2010, the GEOINT Symposium and Annual Geointelligence, Geospatial, and Activity-Based Intelligence Conference held a presentation entitled, Mastering the Human Domain.
[00:53:56.021 --> 00:54:00.624]  Geospatial intelligence and human geography were the main talking points.
[00:54:01.564 --> 00:54:04.846]  Jade Helm is born and begins to take form.
[00:54:06.167 --> 00:54:13.193]  The human domain encompasses the totality of the physical, cultural, and social environments that influence human behavior.
[00:54:13.714 --> 00:54:20.900]  Explained Admiral McRaven, success in this domain won't be achieved by traditional ground, naval, or air forces.
[00:54:21.581 --> 00:54:31.270]  Instead, success in the human domain will depend upon understanding the human terrain and establishing trust with those individuals who occupy that space.
[00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:37.512]  The goal is to see if groups of these special forces can move around the civilian population without being noticed.
[00:54:37.532 --> 00:54:41.514]  You know, blend in so they can place themselves in strategic positions.
[00:54:42.054 --> 00:54:50.437]  McRaven continued by saying, building understanding of the human domain requires boots on the ground feeding information into the network.
[00:54:51.457 --> 00:55:09.030]  A living active map where human beings are movable real-time landmarks and everyone's personal thoughts, feelings, medical information, belief systems, history, basically every shred of information about the individuals in any region on that map will make up the terrain.
[00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:13.693]  When mastering the human domain, the special operators are the masters.
[00:55:14.153 --> 00:55:17.256]  They are the key that turns this whole machine on.
[00:55:18.855 --> 00:55:38.646]  And regardless of whether the military calls this project Activity-Based Intelligence, ABI, Geospatial Intelligence, coupled with Human Domain Analytics, what we are looking at is the nexus between private tech firms, homeland security and law enforcement, domestic surveillance, and the domestic use of special forces.
[00:55:40.307 --> 00:55:42.028]  How is any of this legal?
[00:55:42.468 --> 00:55:46.170]  How is any of this not a violation of the Fourth Amendment?
[00:55:48.095 --> 00:56:00.800]  A tech startup, Recorded Future, that uses a system of filtering through and classifying open source data, demonstrated their predictive analytics capability during the 2012 GEOINT conference.
[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:06.842]  Trajectory Magazine reports, the concept is to find people who are talking about the future.
[00:56:07.443 --> 00:56:10.444]  Vice President for Recorded Future, Matt Kodema says,
[00:56:11.104 --> 00:56:13.085]  We can basically roll back the clock.
[00:56:13.445 --> 00:56:17.487]  We know that this particular did happen in this time at this place.
[00:56:17.908 --> 00:56:21.469]  Now let's go back a week before that and look at the publications.
[00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:23.510]  Who was predicting that accurately?
[00:56:23.931 --> 00:56:24.451]  Who wasn't?
[00:56:25.311 --> 00:56:39.419]  Add this layer of predictive analytics on top of the other human domain analytic and you begin to get an idea of the scope and range of the overarching inescapable control grid these scientific controllers are constructing.
[00:56:40.599 --> 00:56:53.385]  At the same GEOINT conference in 2012, Jeff Jonas, the Chief Scientist for IBM Entity Analytics and an IBM Fellow, talked about the potential for open source data utilization.
[00:56:53.865 --> 00:57:00.668]  He said, in typical IBM tradition, space, time, travel data is the ultimate biometric.
[00:57:01.468 --> 00:57:08.531]  It seems that IBM and the scientific elite's perspective shifted from the master race to mastering the human domain.
[00:57:10.862 --> 00:57:20.208]  So we probably won't see doors kicked in and military trucks shipping political opponents to their demise during this summer's Jade Helm 15 military procedure.
[00:57:20.629 --> 00:57:29.455]  However, as Brzezinski states in Between Two Ages, the technotronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society.
[00:57:30.195 --> 00:57:39.762]  Just like Watson's census was not the end sought by the Nazis, neither is Jade Helm 15 an end, but a means to a historically predictable end.
[00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:55.353]  We must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the capital of a scientific, technological elite.
[00:57:55.793 --> 00:58:06.456]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:58:08.888 --> 00:58:12.451]  This has been an InfoWars.com Report.
[00:58:14.233 --> 00:58:27.685]  Finally, it's key to understand that this is about sending the military out to round people up using full data integration into basically tablets they have.
[00:58:28.526 --> 00:58:32.109]  And having the military feed that info back during Civil War.
[00:58:33.499 --> 00:58:34.820]  It's roundup information.
[00:58:35.641 --> 00:58:42.205]  And of course the Watson computers of IBM are also running the death panels on the don't treat list for the military.
[00:58:42.925 --> 00:58:46.908]  This is the beginning of phasing humans out and the rise of the machine.
[00:58:47.048 --> 00:58:48.049]  Stay with us.

[01:00:15.885 --> 01:00:20.069]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:20.729 --> 01:00:21.530]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.311 --> 01:00:23.191]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.852 --> 01:00:27.495]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.055 --> 01:00:32.099]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:44.278 --> 01:00:52.462]  Phyllis Lafley of the Eagle Forum is going to be breaking down the latest developments on Hillary's plan to stub the ballot boxes, the open borders, TPP and more.
[01:00:53.623 --> 01:01:00.426]  John Bowne has a key report up on InfoWars.com showing how they're planning to try to ram the TPP back through this week.
[01:01:02.327 --> 01:01:06.349]  Here's some of the headlines on InfoWars.com that are so incredibly important.
[01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:09.250]  We're going to be covering coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:01:10.391 --> 01:01:12.212]  Hope calls for global authority.
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:16.363]  To impose climate change agenda.
[01:01:19.505 --> 01:01:25.190]  Banks demand customers account for every deposit and withdrawal before offering mortgages.
[01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:33.697]  So it's basically indentured servitude, IRS reporting on everything you do for the right to engage in commerce.
[01:01:33.717 --> 01:01:37.300]  They're just getting you ready for the total grid.
[01:01:38.168 --> 01:01:43.911]  Meanwhile, taxpayers foot the bill for $128,000 plus for Michelle Obama's sightseeing trip to Venice, Italy.
[01:01:45.572 --> 01:01:46.172]  Must be nice.
[01:01:46.892 --> 01:01:52.355]  Obama pushes Internet ID verification in response to NSA hacking.
[01:01:53.075 --> 01:01:54.056]  Very important article.
[01:01:58.598 --> 01:02:02.099]  Ron Paul's article, Death Penalty, the ultimate corrupt big government program.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:06.762]  And you know, I said I'd get to this last hour, and I just ran out of time.
[01:02:07.813 --> 01:02:10.694]  But sometime today, if not I'll do a special report.
[01:02:10.734 --> 01:02:11.735]  I meant to do this yesterday.
[01:02:12.835 --> 01:02:18.158]  I've got a whole bunch of examples here of innocent people.
[01:02:20.939 --> 01:02:29.583]  What made me think of this is, I guess last Friday I saw this article, Cruz-Paul push for ban on indefinite detention of U.S.
[01:02:29.603 --> 01:02:30.043]  citizens.
[01:02:31.123 --> 01:02:32.544]  I'll try to cover this now in the time we have.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:39.403]  And they're talking about citizens being grabbed overseas and then being put in black sites.
[01:02:39.824 --> 01:02:44.628]  And that's dangerous because then it sets the precedent for it to happen here and they can also make people give false confessions.
[01:02:45.809 --> 01:02:50.313]  I mean obviously you don't do bad things and then keep the moral authority.
[01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:51.534]  So I agree with what they're doing.
[01:02:53.176 --> 01:02:57.179]  And the fact that the media acts like it's so alien and bad shows how twisted things are.
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.963]  But just a couple articles that I've seen lately
[01:03:02.947 --> 01:03:12.709]  And there's a newscast I want to air dealing with this with Kalief Browder, 93 to 2015, no criminal record, in New York.
[01:03:13.649 --> 01:03:30.352]  Police claimed he was a suspect in a backpack that was stolen and he spent three years on Rikers Island, I mean that's rough, without being convicted of a crime, was beat up over and over again on video by jail guards and by the criminals because he wasn't aggressive.
[01:03:31.843 --> 01:03:41.348]  And the newscast just shows all the surveillance footage of him doing nothing, being beaten and choked by guards, being beaten by the inmates, and basically the guards kind of halfway letting him do it.
[01:03:42.008 --> 01:03:44.609]  That's how it works in these corrupt prisons.
[01:03:44.689 --> 01:03:50.232]  Not all prisons have a criminal acumen, a criminal spirit.
[01:03:51.092 --> 01:03:53.334]  Police departments, they're either pretty much good or they're pretty much bad.
[01:03:53.374 --> 01:03:55.775]  There's not really a lot in between historically.
[01:03:56.015 --> 01:03:57.295]  Things go bad, they go good.
[01:03:57.536 --> 01:03:58.076]  It's a culture.
[01:03:59.445 --> 01:04:01.987]  And he finally got out and he just committed suicide.
[01:04:03.468 --> 01:04:04.529]  Now his family's suing.
[01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:06.411]  He's a black man.
[01:04:07.051 --> 01:04:07.672]  Was a black man.
[01:04:07.692 --> 01:04:08.072]  He's dead.
[01:04:09.733 --> 01:04:17.480]  But, I mean, how did he end up three years in a prison without ever having a trial?
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:19.001]  Well, that's how they do it now in America.
[01:04:19.721 --> 01:04:20.502]  Remember this story?
[01:04:21.102 --> 01:04:22.484]  I'm just using some that are well known.
[01:04:23.104 --> 01:04:25.146]  Man left in solitary confinement for two years.
[01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:31.072]  Steven Slevin was held for 22 months on a DWI.
[01:04:31.492 --> 01:04:32.593]  No judge, no jury.
[01:04:35.354 --> 01:04:36.355]  In a New Mexico jail.
[01:04:38.396 --> 01:04:41.137]  He was forced to pull out his tooth because it was infected.
[01:04:42.338 --> 01:04:43.158]  They never let him out.
[01:04:44.139 --> 01:04:44.979]  They just kept him there.
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:48.301]  No one knew where he went.
[01:04:48.341 --> 01:04:49.221]  They thought he disappeared.
[01:04:49.541 --> 01:04:50.222]  They just kidnapped him.
[01:04:51.102 --> 01:04:52.923]  They had to pay a $15 million plus settlement.
[01:04:52.943 --> 01:04:53.223]  $15.5 million.
[01:04:57.327 --> 01:05:02.633]  And now the family of Kalief Broder has got a $14 million lawsuit.
[01:05:03.494 --> 01:05:07.118]  I guess that's the going rate on people being put in dungeons.
[01:05:08.451 --> 01:05:09.412]  Anybody could disappear.
[01:05:09.732 --> 01:05:16.259]  You've probably heard that synthetic ingredients in your food could be harmful to your health, but what about the clothes on your back?
[01:05:16.499 --> 01:05:20.763]  In the article, The Hidden Toxins in Your Closet, Dr. Group breaks it down.
[01:05:21.063 --> 01:05:30.212]  Popular clothing stores like H&M, Levi's, and Gap are beginning to turn their attention toward producing healthier and more environmentally friendly clothing.
[01:05:30.752 --> 01:05:38.975]  Increased consumer awareness around the dangers of synthetic dyes as well as other things are fueling a drastic revolution in the fashion industry.
[01:05:39.396 --> 01:05:49.200]  Keeping in line with current trends, clothing retailers are finally attempting to appeal to health-conscious buyers as well as appease international health organizations.
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:54.942]  And as with any movement, the best way to have your voice heard is to vote with your dollars.
[01:05:55.522 --> 01:06:00.184]  Support companies who make clothing out of bamboo, organic cotton, or flax.
[01:06:00.624 --> 01:06:03.826]  And always choose clothes produced using natural dyes.
[01:06:04.146 --> 01:06:06.327]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[01:06:09.853 --> 01:06:15.277]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[01:06:15.577 --> 01:06:30.027]  We worked with the top developers in the field of Getox™ to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[01:06:30.287 --> 01:06:38.092]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[01:06:38.292 --> 01:06:43.735]  And when you visit Infowarslife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[01:06:43.855 --> 01:06:47.237]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[01:06:47.417 --> 01:06:51.399]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:55.422]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[01:06:55.862 --> 01:06:59.843]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.

[01:07:08.046 --> 01:07:19.769]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:26.891]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:27.072 --> 01:07:31.773]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:31.953 --> 01:07:35.595]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[01:07:36.715 --> 01:07:37.616]  We're good to go.
[01:08:00.791 --> 01:08:06.936]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great-tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:08:07.097 --> 01:08:08.818]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:08:12.361 --> 01:08:14.623]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:15.144 --> 01:08:17.946]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:37.222 --> 01:08:39.944]  Phyllis Schlafly is our guest for the next 25 minutes.
[01:08:39.984 --> 01:08:44.768]  She's the founder of the Eagle Forum, eagleforum.org.
[01:08:45.408 --> 01:08:53.755]  She is undoubtedly the greatest libertarian, constitutionalist, conservative woman living.
[01:08:55.376 --> 01:08:57.938]  And if you want to know where the Tea Party that we see today came from, i.e.
[01:08:58.419 --> 01:09:06.185]  real conservatives, not John Boehner-type rhinos, it came from Barry Goldwater and Phyllis Schlafly.
[01:09:07.515 --> 01:09:14.019]  I mean, she predates Ron Paul as a national figure by about 25, 30 years.
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:26.166]  And she is, of course, a constitutional lawyer as well, a true example of a powerful, intelligent woman defending our republic, strengthening our families.
[01:09:26.186 --> 01:09:32.630]  I mean, I don't like to get up here and grovel to our guests, but as I get older, I really begin to realize
[01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:35.171]  How amazing people are.
[01:09:35.231 --> 01:09:36.413]  People I've already appreciated.
[01:09:36.913 --> 01:09:38.875]  But the fact that we should appreciate them even more.
[01:09:38.915 --> 01:09:41.597]  I mean, she's a well-to-do, successful woman.
[01:09:42.077 --> 01:09:43.779]  She's a grandmother, you name it.
[01:09:43.799 --> 01:09:52.406]  She doesn't need, since she's been fighting for freedom since she was 20 years old, to be coming on the show or doing scores of interviews every week.
[01:09:52.426 --> 01:09:58.431]  But she does, just like Charlton Heston did before he died, because she cares about freedom so much.
[01:09:58.712 --> 01:09:59.873]  So she's a modern hero.
[01:10:01.115 --> 01:10:06.173]  She deserves to be a Time Magazine Person of the Year, not eugenicist globalist.
[01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:08.691]  Pro-death Margaret Sanger.
[01:10:09.431 --> 01:10:11.113]  So she's a true icon.
[01:10:12.033 --> 01:10:13.694]  Eagleforum.org.
[01:10:14.094 --> 01:10:29.945]  I won't go over all the work she's done, the best-selling book she's written, but she joins us now to give us her state-of-the-world breakdown, the open borders, the TPP, Hillary's plan to get in, saying if you're not for her, you're not for women, you know, vote for the grandma.
[01:10:30.025 --> 01:10:33.167]  Truly sickening when all they've done is disempower women.
[01:10:33.187 --> 01:10:33.887]  Look at the numbers.
[01:10:34.868 --> 01:10:36.069]  And she's got a detailed report
[01:10:37.112 --> 01:10:39.733]  That was out in WorldNetDaily last week.
[01:10:39.813 --> 01:10:42.274]  Hillary's plans to stuff the ballot box.
[01:10:42.734 --> 01:10:44.695]  So Phyllis Schlafly joins us.
[01:10:45.015 --> 01:10:46.355]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[01:10:46.896 --> 01:10:47.616]  Hi Alex.
[01:10:47.976 --> 01:10:49.096]  Always good to join you.
[01:10:49.116 --> 01:10:50.277]  It's great to have you.
[01:10:50.497 --> 01:10:52.998]  Thanks for all those kind words you said about me.
[01:10:53.378 --> 01:10:55.479]  Well it's all true so it's no brag just fact.
[01:10:55.759 --> 01:10:56.879]  What do you want to tackle first?
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:02.161]  Well the hottest thing in Washington now is this trade deal.
[01:11:03.072 --> 01:11:13.761]  And a lot of people are misled about it, but I think it's about the worst piece of legislation that I've ever seen, because it gives away so much of our sovereignty.
[01:11:14.501 --> 01:11:29.553]  And we're very proud that we are a sovereign, independent nation that's built a land of freedom and prosperity, and the idea that Congress should give away some of its sovereignty to a bunch of globalist busybodies is just outrageous.
[01:11:30.228 --> 01:11:36.234]  And it was all negotiated practically in a closet in a little room with Obama and a few foreigners.
[01:11:36.895 --> 01:11:39.538]  And we know what a lousy negotiator he is.
[01:11:40.359 --> 01:11:43.222]  And we got the short side of the stick.
[01:11:46.398 --> 01:11:51.942]  I mean, 30 years ago, 40 years ago, there would be probably indictments happening.
[01:11:52.162 --> 01:11:56.145]  This would be called treason, trying to secretly sign us over to foreign corporate boards.
[01:11:56.765 --> 01:12:02.569]  Now, people like Ryan and Boehner and others parade around promoting it like it's a good thing.
[01:12:04.131 --> 01:12:05.972]  I'm afraid there's money involved.
[01:12:06.072 --> 01:12:14.698]  I can't prove it, but, you know, when things are happening that make no sense, it's probably a case of some money changing hand.
[01:12:15.205 --> 01:12:24.629]  But in any event, what they're doing is very bad, and the one who's really been speaking out and telling the truth about it is Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions.
[01:12:25.269 --> 01:12:40.636]  And he is a real patriot, and you ought to read everything that he writes on this, because he is showing that this thing called free trade, which has to have, I think, four different votes in order to lock it in,
[01:12:42.063 --> 01:12:45.045]  It's just a giveaway of our sovereignty.
[01:12:45.105 --> 01:13:00.391]  It's giving these global busybodies control over our trade, our immigration, everything you can think of, and it allows them to change it after they finish it.
[01:13:00.831 --> 01:13:09.615]  In other words, the Congress passes it, these globalist busybodies can change it, because they call it a living document.
[01:13:10.174 --> 01:13:16.035]  And you remember when some of these off-the-wall Supreme Court justices talked about a living Constitution.
[01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:28.077]  That was just a code word for saying that they could rewrite it according to their own up-to-date ideas and personal preferences.
[01:13:28.917 --> 01:13:37.479]  And we think if Congress passes a law, it ought to be obeyed, unless it's revoked or reversed.
[01:13:38.323 --> 01:13:41.407]  And the Constitution is the supreme law of our land.
[01:13:41.888 --> 01:13:52.280]  And we don't want these global busybodies controlling our trade, our commerce, our immigration, and then bringing other countries like China into the deal.
[01:13:57.759 --> 01:14:02.944]  Paleo-conservative organization out there just defending the basic ideas that founded this country.
[01:14:02.984 --> 01:14:10.011]  We see an upside-down world push where they act like we're the traitors because we don't want a secret treaty.
[01:14:10.051 --> 01:14:15.095]  But WikiLeaks has leaked three sections as you know and Senator Sessions has seen even more.
[01:14:16.116 --> 01:14:25.458]  And it gets rid of the borders, it gives the president dictatorial power across the board, it censors the internet and free speech, it puts foreign boards over our businesses.
[01:14:26.158 --> 01:14:32.180]  I mean, I can't believe Congress, as corrupt as they are, would even consider signing on.
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.760]  But here's my next question.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:35.881]  There's always got to be a bottom.
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:48.989]  And was last Friday the bottom, or at least the inklings of a bottom, where they go so far that even the establishment, part of the establishment, can't go along with it?
[01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:53.633]  Because there's got to be some end to the arrogance, some end to the craziness.
[01:14:54.474 --> 01:14:57.516]  Federal courts striking down Obama, just opening the borders up.
[01:14:57.576 --> 01:15:00.258]  He's still doing it, but at least courts have said he can't.
[01:15:00.278 --> 01:15:04.501]  I mean, there seems to be just one of the biggest constitutional crises
[01:15:05.322 --> 01:15:09.423]  We've ever seen, not just in our lifetimes, but in the 240-year history of this nation.
[01:15:10.743 --> 01:15:11.463]  I agree with you.
[01:15:11.903 --> 01:15:13.023]  I agree with all of that.
[01:15:13.103 --> 01:15:14.364]  It is so shocking.
[01:15:14.384 --> 01:15:16.964]  It's just so awesome.
[01:15:16.984 --> 01:15:19.084]  You can hardly believe what they are doing.
[01:15:19.805 --> 01:15:24.385]  And they're conspired in by both Republicans and Democrats.
[01:15:25.586 --> 01:15:30.807]  Some of each kind are to blame because they're ballyhooed by these
[01:15:33.894 --> 01:15:41.717]  The lobbyists for the big companies who really want our immigration increase so they get the cheap labor.
[01:15:42.517 --> 01:15:44.798]  I think that's what's at the bottom of a lot of it.
[01:15:45.238 --> 01:15:47.719]  And then the people who've been trying to give us globalists.
[01:15:47.759 --> 01:15:55.443]  You know, I spent a year of my life fighting one of the George Bushes, I get him mixed up, who wanted to put us in a North American union.
[01:15:55.923 --> 01:15:59.044]  We don't want to be in a union with Mexico and Canada.
[01:15:59.899 --> 01:16:02.301]  We didn't like that idea, and we did beat him on that.
[01:16:02.661 --> 01:16:15.692]  But now they're coming back in this bill, it's before them right now, and in effect, as Senator Sessions said, it really puts us in some kind of a European Union.
[01:16:16.232 --> 01:16:18.114]  So they didn't dictate our laws.
[01:16:18.134 --> 01:16:25.980]  You know, they just decided, these global busybodies, just a few weeks ago, that we have to repeal our cool law.
[01:16:26.647 --> 01:16:30.070]  And our cruel law stands for country of origin.
[01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:35.053]  And I'd like to know where our meat is coming from before I buy it.
[01:16:35.814 --> 01:16:37.355]  And so would the American people.
[01:16:37.776 --> 01:16:45.762]  But the Congress has now said, oh yes, these global busybodies have said we have to repeal it, so we repeal it.
[01:16:47.743 --> 01:16:49.905]  You can hardly believe they're doing this kind of thing.
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:52.181]  Phyllis Schlafly is our guest.
[01:16:52.221 --> 01:16:54.163]  We're also on television, not just radio.
[01:16:54.183 --> 01:17:10.555]  We're showing footage, there's hundreds of these videos, in France at the tunnel, at the ferries and the tunnel, where police basically on both sides are undermanned and ordered, it's come out, to stand down and let them get on the buses, get on the hijacked vehicles.
[01:17:11.075 --> 01:17:12.696]  And then they just basically let them through.
[01:17:13.036 --> 01:17:16.138]  When the police try to stop them, it becomes a human rights abuse claim.
[01:17:17.078 --> 01:17:18.439]  And they're, quote, allowed to migrate.
[01:17:18.679 --> 01:17:19.660]  Africa's collapsing.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:20.960]  The Middle East is collapsing.
[01:17:21.401 --> 01:17:24.262]  Boats are sinking every week coming across to Italy.
[01:17:25.143 --> 01:17:27.504]  And the so-called left wants to allow this.
[01:17:28.024 --> 01:17:32.747]  Do they understand that there's six plus billion people that want to come into the West?
[01:17:33.247 --> 01:17:39.591]  And then once they're given welfare, the socialists will have checkmate on political groups that'll vote to do whatever they want?
[01:17:40.953 --> 01:17:50.360]  Well, I hope you've read Ann Coulter's book, Adios America, because she really tells it like it is, and how it will absolutely change America.
[01:17:50.981 --> 01:18:01.189]  And these people coming in, you know, I'm glad to welcome people who want to be American, who want to speak English, who want to obey our laws and our Constitution.
[01:18:01.509 --> 01:18:04.411]  But these people coming in don't want to be American.
[01:18:04.891 --> 01:18:08.094]  They want to change us and make us like their country.
[01:18:08.594 --> 01:18:10.576]  And there's no other country like America.
[01:18:11.613 --> 01:18:13.054]  I agree, but it's beyond that.
[01:18:13.834 --> 01:18:15.495]  The third world is unsustainable.
[01:18:15.895 --> 01:18:16.815]  It's collapsing.
[01:18:16.875 --> 01:18:19.596]  The birth rates are astronomical, like five children.
[01:18:20.337 --> 01:18:24.538]  The left is bringing people here and then teaching them to hate the country in a political takeover.
[01:18:24.919 --> 01:18:29.720]  Don't they get that we're collapsing into Blade Runner meets
[01:18:31.121 --> 01:18:31.741]  Road Warrior?
[01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:35.182]  I mean, this is a really dangerous scenario right now.
[01:18:35.202 --> 01:18:39.764]  We're already teetering worldwide on top of debts that are unsustainable.
[01:18:40.064 --> 01:18:42.064]  You can see it building towards a crescendo.
[01:18:43.025 --> 01:18:52.487]  Well, the people who are coming in don't understand that, because they don't understand how we're in a precarious position.
[01:18:52.908 --> 01:19:00.810]  But they think anything in America is better, and it probably is better than what they have, even with all of our debt.
[01:19:02.091 --> 01:19:09.895]  But we know we're losing our strength, our prosperity, our freedom, all that sort of thing.
[01:19:10.495 --> 01:19:17.638]  And we have the best country in the world, and we shouldn't give it away.
[01:19:17.718 --> 01:19:22.340]  And if we let all these people in who don't believe in America, it's going to be a different world.
[01:19:23.067 --> 01:19:27.069]  And I think a lot of the Democrats are doing it because they want the vote.
[01:19:27.549 --> 01:19:31.491]  They think these people coming in don't know anything about limited government.
[01:19:31.832 --> 01:19:34.053]  They think the government should be their provider.
[01:19:34.893 --> 01:19:36.694]  And so they'll vote Democratic.
[01:19:40.984 --> 01:19:42.865]  It's a tremendous change.
[01:19:42.885 --> 01:19:48.589]  You know, when Obama went into office, he said he wanted to fundamentally change America.
[01:19:48.970 --> 01:19:54.534]  And he's been doing it, and somehow the congressmen are letting him get by with it.
[01:19:55.154 --> 01:19:57.576]  Phyllis Schlafly, EagleForum.org is our guest.
[01:19:57.636 --> 01:19:58.537]  Final segment with her.
[01:19:58.557 --> 01:20:00.178]  I want to get into her investigative report.
[01:20:00.498 --> 01:20:02.260]  Hillary's plan to stop the ballot box.
[01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:04.001]  I mean, what a nightmare.
[01:20:04.041 --> 01:20:05.042]  Hillary and Jeb.
[01:20:05.122 --> 01:20:05.923]  I mean, really?
[01:20:06.443 --> 01:20:07.324]  Is this a nightmare?
[01:20:07.364 --> 01:20:08.565]  I mean, can I wake up from this?
[01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:15.085]  Now a twice as nice Twin Kit special offer from Complete H2O Minerals for all GCN listeners.

[01:20:34.194 --> 01:20:34.995]  Limited time offer.
[01:20:35.075 --> 01:20:36.255]  Call 803-794-4767 or click completeh2ominerals.com.
[01:20:39.617 --> 01:20:48.863]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:20:48.903 --> 01:20:49.643]  This capitalism?
[01:20:49.703 --> 01:20:55.827]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:20:55.867 --> 01:20:59.509]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:20:59.569 --> 01:21:00.490]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:01.550]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:21:01.570 --> 01:21:01.851]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:01.891 --> 01:21:02.231]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:21:09.435 --> 01:21:11.516]  So the phone rings, and I pick it up, and it's Mark.
[01:21:11.556 --> 01:21:16.858]  And Mark says to me, hey, third Sunday, June, Father's Day, I ordered Dad a gun.
[01:21:16.938 --> 01:21:17.439]  It's here.
[01:21:17.819 --> 01:21:20.540]  He's going to build it out, and we're going to go out on Father's Day shooting.
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:21.140]  You want to come?
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:21.901]  And I said, yeah.
[01:21:22.121 --> 01:21:26.883]  What a great idea for a Father's Day gift, an AR-15 rifle kit from Guns80.com.
[01:21:26.943 --> 01:21:27.963]  I think I'll get my dad one.
[01:21:27.983 --> 01:21:28.664]  He says, go ahead.
[01:21:28.944 --> 01:21:29.684]  See you out on the range.
[01:21:29.704 --> 01:21:31.305]  So we're going to meet on the range on Father's Day.
[01:21:31.605 --> 01:21:35.067]  Get your dad an AR-15 rifle kit at Guns80.com, Guns80.com, or call 844-2GUNS80.
[01:21:39.071 --> 01:21:47.777]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic, and only one system allows you to produce an endless supply of nano-sized silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.

[01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:14.514]  At 30dayfoodsupply.com, two of our top priorities are providing quality food at a reasonable price and protecting your security.
[01:22:14.834 --> 01:22:22.799]  When you call 800-700-2184, we will never record your phone call and never ask for your personal information, like how much food you have stored or where you keep it.
[01:22:23.099 --> 01:22:26.862]  We'll also never store your credit card information and email address on a computer.
[01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:29.183]  Your email address will never be shared or sold.
[01:22:29.423 --> 01:22:31.365]  We'll never limit the number of boxes you can purchase.
[01:22:31.585 --> 01:22:34.987]  We'll never use outside packers or use relabeled food from another company.

[01:23:06.976 --> 01:23:09.597]  Honey, it's time for dinner.
[01:23:10.318 --> 01:23:11.738]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[01:23:12.198 --> 01:23:13.459]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[01:23:13.679 --> 01:23:14.779]  Mine is falling apart.
[01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:21.002]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[01:23:21.482 --> 01:23:24.183]  I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[01:23:24.604 --> 01:23:25.124]  What is that?
[01:23:25.444 --> 01:23:34.552]  Well, apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[01:23:34.992 --> 01:23:43.379]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:44.040]  Wow!
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:45.261]  That sounds scary.
[01:23:45.661 --> 01:23:50.005]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold shielded wallet.
[01:23:50.105 --> 01:23:50.926]  Are they more expensive?
[01:23:51.366 --> 01:23:51.587]  No.
[01:23:51.867 --> 01:23:59.137]  In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from idstronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[01:23:59.557 --> 01:24:00.398]  Sounds great!
[01:24:00.739 --> 01:24:03.362]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[01:24:03.382 --> 01:24:07.448]  I want to be protected, and these wallets at idstronghold.com look fantastic!
[01:24:14.381 --> 01:24:22.728]  Phyllis Schlafly is our guest, founder of EagleForum.org, best-selling author, syndicated columnist.
[01:24:24.651 --> 01:24:30.694]  She was there at the beginning with Barry Goldwater of the folks that said the Republican Party are not a bunch of New World or globalists.
[01:24:31.034 --> 01:24:34.776]  They're going to join with the Democrats, turning our country into a socialist nightmare.
[01:24:35.357 --> 01:24:39.039]  And if it wasn't for her and others, we'd already be completely under the system.
[01:24:39.359 --> 01:24:40.119]  It's a big victory.
[01:24:40.139 --> 01:24:41.920]  The TPP got shot down last week.
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:46.123]  They're trying to ram it through again this week, but resistance is mounting.
[01:24:47.543 --> 01:24:50.265]  But the problem is the illegal waves
[01:24:51.724 --> 01:25:01.000]  are used to be the political voting block and Phyllis has written a detailed article, Hillary's plan to stuff the ballot box at WND.com.
[01:25:01.782 --> 01:25:04.025]  Phyllis, please spend some time breaking this down for folks.
[01:25:04.778 --> 01:25:05.958]  Well, yes, of course.
[01:25:06.018 --> 01:25:10.639]  My book was called A Choice, Not an Echo, and that's kind of gone into the English language.
[01:25:11.339 --> 01:25:15.980]  When we pick our nominees for president, we want a choice.
[01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:21.562]  We don't want an echo of the bunch of losers that the Kingmakers have been giving us lately.
[01:25:21.582 --> 01:25:27.243]  And I want to take a minute to talk about the left's manipulation of words.
[01:25:27.683 --> 01:25:32.604]  You know, I think the gays have gotten what they've gotten in our judiciary.
[01:25:33.297 --> 01:25:38.540]  By the clever use of two words, inevitability and discrimination.
[01:25:39.501 --> 01:25:49.147]  And when they say their side is inevitable, and if you're against them you're discriminated, that's really what has given them the start.
[01:25:49.587 --> 01:25:51.569]  Now you can apply that to free trade.
[01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:56.552]  Now the only thing that's free about free trade is what China can do for free.
[01:25:57.369 --> 01:26:00.292]  There isn't anything free about it for the United States.
[01:26:01.794 --> 01:26:02.675]  It's a big cheat.
[01:26:02.715 --> 01:26:05.017]  It should be called one-sided screwjob trade.
[01:26:05.798 --> 01:26:06.099]  Right.
[01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:07.400]  You're right.
[01:26:08.561 --> 01:26:14.308]  And we need to make sure we don't fall for these words that are trying to manipulate our thinking.
[01:26:15.922 --> 01:26:16.843]  Well said.
[01:26:16.863 --> 01:26:23.348]  What about Hillary's brazen getting money from third world dictators, the State Department, to her foundation to then sell them weapons?
[01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:28.612]  And they're just brushing it off and now her plan that you break down to stop the ballot box.
[01:26:30.033 --> 01:26:35.218]  Well, of course, she's all for bringing in more immigrants from other countries.
[01:26:35.758 --> 01:26:45.246]  And these immigrants who come in have no comprehension of limited government and of the way our Constitution sets up the freedom in our land.
[01:26:46.059 --> 01:26:55.846]  And so they're going to come in and expect the government to take care of them, and this government starts giving them welfare benefits of all kinds, so they'll vote Democratic.
[01:26:56.287 --> 01:26:57.527]  I think it's a matter of votes.
[01:26:58.108 --> 01:27:11.017]  I think a lot of the big business, the lobbyists, want the cheap, low-paid workers for their businesses, and Hillary and the Democrats want Democratic votes in the ballot box.
[01:27:11.057 --> 01:27:12.178]  That's what it's all about.
[01:27:12.947 --> 01:27:19.469]  Well sure, CNN calls it birth tourism and says Chinese mothers by the thousands a week come to the U.S.
[01:27:19.509 --> 01:27:20.850]  to have their babies for free.
[01:27:21.250 --> 01:27:23.751]  There's the headline, Why Chinese Moms Want American Babies.
[01:27:24.071 --> 01:27:29.193]  And they just say it like it's reasonable and cute when you can't go anywhere else in the world and get this.
[01:27:29.253 --> 01:27:29.933]  This is a joke.
[01:27:30.293 --> 01:27:34.535]  And now Chinese have surpassed Mexicans as the number one group pouring in.
[01:27:34.815 --> 01:27:36.776]  There's a billion, three hundred million of them.
[01:27:36.796 --> 01:27:37.816]  This is suicide.
[01:27:38.376 --> 01:27:39.777]  Yes, it is suicide.
[01:27:40.516 --> 01:27:47.102]  And we have an exceptional, wonderful country here, and it's up to us to do it.
[01:27:47.162 --> 01:27:50.444]  And I urge everybody to be involved in politics.
[01:27:51.005 --> 01:27:53.987]  You can't just pray and expect the Lord to do it.
[01:27:55.028 --> 01:27:56.690]  That's not his job.
[01:27:57.030 --> 01:28:06.378]  It's our job to make use of the political elements in our society to kick the bad guys out and get the good guys in.
[01:28:07.808 --> 01:28:10.089]  Why are the bad guys so destructive?
[01:28:10.129 --> 01:28:11.390]  I mean, they're in control.
[01:28:11.550 --> 01:28:16.412]  What they're doing will destroy their power base, and will end up destroying their own nest.
[01:28:17.013 --> 01:28:19.054]  Is it just an instinct to overrun everything?
[01:28:19.094 --> 01:28:19.974]  A criminal instinct?
[01:28:20.034 --> 01:28:20.454]  What is it?
[01:28:22.015 --> 01:28:25.537]  Well, I think it's the... they think they're going to make money out of it.
[01:28:26.337 --> 01:28:37.123]  And they think... but it's a short-term look at the raising of that money, because even though they may get some cheap labor for a while,
[01:28:38.119 --> 01:28:39.961]  They still are destroying our system.
[01:28:40.582 --> 01:28:45.888]  And it's our system that has enabled them to become rich and successful.
[01:28:47.229 --> 01:28:54.137]  Yeah, it'd be like if I went home and killed my parents just so I could say I was dominant when they're the ones that had me, brought me up, took care of me.
[01:28:54.437 --> 01:28:57.621]  It just makes, it's just, it's so self-destructive.
[01:28:59.088 --> 01:29:22.798]  Yes it is, and Sessions said that these trade agreements that Obama signed onto, that they're putting all the pressure on to try to make Congress pass, that they simply are really, they're taking away our sovereignty, they're taking away our wealth, they're
[01:29:24.368 --> 01:29:25.970]  They're just changing our country.
[01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:30.395]  Well, as Obama said it best, he wanted to fundamentally transform it.
[01:29:30.415 --> 01:29:31.356]  We're being conquered!
[01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:33.170]  Right.
[01:29:33.770 --> 01:29:37.191]  Phyllis Schlafly, your book is now back in print, updated.
[01:29:37.351 --> 01:29:38.351]  A choice, not an echo.
[01:29:38.431 --> 01:29:46.392]  It's really updated because the recent years are really very interesting and nobody's told the story of how the Kingmakers are still... It's amazing.
[01:29:46.512 --> 01:29:47.853]  EagleForum.org.
[01:29:47.893 --> 01:29:48.693]  Thank you for the time.
[01:29:48.993 --> 01:29:49.633]  Have a great week.
[01:29:49.673 --> 01:29:50.353]  You're an icon.
[01:29:50.393 --> 01:29:50.753]  Thank you.
[01:29:51.433 --> 01:29:51.773]  Bye.
[01:29:52.473 --> 01:29:53.333]  An amazing lady.
[01:29:53.393 --> 01:29:55.874]  Most folks don't know how important she is or how great she is.
[01:29:55.894 --> 01:29:58.534]  But wasn't for her and Barry Goldwater, we'd be done.
[01:29:58.954 --> 01:29:59.835]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.355 --> 01:30:01.855]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.878 --> 01:30:05.574]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.841 --> 01:30:16.285]  Minority Report style policing is here, with the article, Police Release Pre-Crime Smartphone App.
[01:30:16.725 --> 01:30:25.570]  Swiss police have released a pre-crime smartphone app which warns users about crimes before they are committed, based on criminal prediction software.
[01:30:25.990 --> 01:30:36.556]  And across the world as well, numerous police departments in the US are also using similar technology, such as the Miami Police Department, which has adopted prediction software.
[01:30:37.296 --> 01:30:40.199]  And understandably, the app has some people concerned.
[01:30:40.639 --> 01:30:53.491]  We've heard stories of people driving off bridges and into bodies of water because their GPS app told them to do so, so it's very possible that you could be harassed just because you're in the wrong place at the wrong time.
[01:30:54.211 --> 01:31:00.661]  And contrast this with the Waze app, which among many other things allowed you to tag the locations of police officers.
[01:31:01.002 --> 01:31:03.385]  And many officers said that was unacceptable.
[01:31:03.946 --> 01:31:07.572]  You can find more reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[01:31:09.679 --> 01:31:10.220]  I want more candy!
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:11.341]  I want more video games!
[01:31:11.401 --> 01:31:12.602]  Mine, mine, mine!
[01:31:12.903 --> 01:31:22.313]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:31:22.653 --> 01:31:25.196]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:31:25.356 --> 01:31:28.720]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:31.643]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system.
[01:31:31.803 --> 01:31:32.243]  We're good to go.
[01:31:57.867 --> 01:32:04.829]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website, InfoWars.com.
[01:32:18.012 --> 01:32:25.976]  Because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused.
[01:32:26.216 --> 01:32:29.138]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[01:32:29.298 --> 01:32:35.361]  Well then, about six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms, HDfirearms.com.
[01:32:35.661 --> 01:32:38.882]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, special ops people.
[01:32:38.982 --> 01:32:43.825]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[01:32:44.085 --> 01:32:47.827]  It's always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[01:32:48.027 --> 01:32:50.328]  Go to their website, HDFirearms.com.
[01:32:50.408 --> 01:32:54.631]  Buy right off their website, and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice.
[01:32:54.831 --> 01:32:58.012]  You can pick it up at the gun show, you can pick it up at the local sporting goods store.
[01:32:58.192 --> 01:33:02.334]  Whatever you do, get your Head Down firearm today.
[01:33:02.555 --> 01:33:06.917]  The spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms.
[01:33:07.217 --> 01:33:08.178]  HDFirearms.com.
[01:33:18.857 --> 01:33:21.499]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:21.519 --> 01:33:26.623]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:33:26.643 --> 01:33:33.468]  I want you.
[01:33:33.528 --> 01:33:35.310]  I need you.
[01:33:35.370 --> 01:33:38.132]  I want you to be my tonight.
[01:33:39.633 --> 01:33:40.954]  You need me.
[01:33:41.294 --> 01:33:42.755]  You tease me.
[01:33:43.476 --> 01:33:45.598]  Use you up and throw you away.
[01:33:48.482 --> 01:33:50.423]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:50.443 --> 01:33:50.903]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:50.943 --> 01:33:52.224]  Central, we're here live.
[01:33:52.744 --> 01:33:59.226]  We've now reached the point of return, the midway point, halfway into this global worldwide transmission.
[01:34:00.027 --> 01:34:01.227]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:34:02.668 --> 01:34:16.013]  Coming up at the start of the next hour, I'm gonna tell a personal story about something I did at the advice of Dr. Group and others that is the single number one most
[01:34:17.461 --> 01:34:21.824]  Life-changing thing I've done in my health that had instant effects.
[01:34:23.264 --> 01:34:23.985]  Instant effects.
[01:34:24.745 --> 01:34:31.930]  And we're going to cover a bunch of health news and a bunch of geopolitical news during that, but that's coming up at the start of the next hour, so please stay with us for that.
[01:34:32.650 --> 01:34:36.272]  Separately, I've done an hour and a half and have not plugged anything in an hour and a half.
[01:34:36.332 --> 01:34:38.313]  Most talk show hosts plug every segment.
[01:34:38.333 --> 01:34:40.835]  Maybe I should, and my funding problems would be over.
[01:34:42.048 --> 01:34:44.070]  I'd have reporters right now to cover everything I want to cover.
[01:34:44.411 --> 01:34:49.236]  But we're getting pretty close to that, looking to hire a couple more reporters, camera people, more writers.
[01:34:49.897 --> 01:34:52.700]  And then I think InfoWars is done growing, at least for the next few years.
[01:34:54.201 --> 01:35:01.510]  I just need to be able to have reporters in two different spots at one time and to be able to, again, expand our production ability.
[01:35:01.570 --> 01:35:12.284]  And it's through purchases of the products, of the water filters, the shortwave radios, the books, the videos, the Patriot apparel, the nutraceuticals, and other items at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:35:13.365 --> 01:35:20.614]  And places like HDFirearms.com with all their great accessories that we are able to fund this operation.
[01:35:20.674 --> 01:35:25.440]  So my pledge to you is to bring you the highest quality products at the lowest possible price.
[01:35:25.821 --> 01:35:30.406]  Tomorrow's the last day to get 20% off ProPure G2 filtration system.
[01:35:31.462 --> 01:35:39.748]  That is a huge discount we're running right now on their portable pitcher system at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:35:40.409 --> 01:35:42.570]  And I told you we were running out.
[01:35:43.231 --> 01:35:49.435]  We're trying to secure more of the deep earth crystal source of pure iodine that nobody else has and nobody else uses.
[01:35:52.597 --> 01:35:55.660]  It's mainly used in industrial medication development.
[01:35:56.513 --> 01:35:56.753]  That's good.
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:12.400]  amount left that was manufactured.
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:13.440]  It came in last week.
[01:36:13.841 --> 01:36:16.901]  When that sells out, that'll be the end of it for a while.
[01:36:16.961 --> 01:36:26.143]  So if you want to get our Emergency Survival Shield X2 Nation Iodine, it's available at InfoWarsLife.com today, right now.
[01:36:26.363 --> 01:36:36.305]  And the bad halogens, the bromide, the bromine, the fluoride, the hydrofluorosilicic acid, the chlorine, those are all the bad ones in the periodic table.
[01:36:37.125 --> 01:36:38.625]  And that's in the food, that's in the water.
[01:36:40.233 --> 01:36:44.056]  And then it fills up your glands like your thyroid and just does all sorts of havoc.
[01:36:44.456 --> 01:36:45.877]  The good one is iodine.
[01:36:47.638 --> 01:36:49.920]  And by the way, I've never really talked about this.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.021]  We never get to this.
[01:36:51.081 --> 01:37:03.509]  If you go to infowarestore.com and click on the Survival Shield X2 section, just click on the middle one right there, guys.
[01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:05.951]  Survival Shield X2, right there.
[01:37:06.512 --> 01:37:09.574]  If you click on that and you scroll down to the bottom,
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:13.922]  We use one of the biggest third-party review sites.
[01:37:14.463 --> 01:37:15.103]  Scroll to the bottom.
[01:37:16.524 --> 01:37:18.626]  One of the biggest third-party review sites.
[01:37:20.267 --> 01:37:21.768]  I don't know why we put it all the way at the bottom.
[01:37:21.788 --> 01:37:22.668]  We need to add a link.
[01:37:22.688 --> 01:37:26.471]  I've said this a few times, but we need to add a link up there saying, read the reviews.
[01:37:27.111 --> 01:37:28.953]  This is from Review Snapshot.
[01:37:29.393 --> 01:37:30.914]  It's embedded from a third-party site.
[01:37:31.474 --> 01:37:34.577]  No one on their own site has a 99% review rate.
[01:37:37.159 --> 01:37:39.582]  Ninety-nine percent review.
[01:37:39.602 --> 01:37:41.764]  No one else has it.
[01:37:41.984 --> 01:37:43.646]  Ninety-nine percent.
[01:37:44.066 --> 01:37:46.489]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:37:46.849 --> 01:37:54.317]  And so I'm going to start something today where I always read a review on air.
[01:37:55.318 --> 01:37:55.958]  So every day,
[01:37:57.210 --> 01:38:02.255]  We're going to print off some of the latest reviews, the good, the bad, and the ugly, and we're going to read them, the latest reviews.
[01:38:02.575 --> 01:38:04.337]  In fact, let's read the newest top one.
[01:38:04.357 --> 01:38:05.138]  I haven't even looked at it.
[01:38:05.739 --> 01:38:07.040]  I looked at it last night.
[01:38:08.561 --> 01:38:09.442]  Let's go ahead and blow it up.
[01:38:10.904 --> 01:38:13.446]  Once a day with water and feel the power.
[01:38:16.569 --> 01:38:18.371]  That's what Indy Atlantic has to say.
[01:38:18.411 --> 01:38:18.892]  Here's another one.
[01:38:19.898 --> 01:38:21.180]  I mean, just go read the reviews.
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:26.667]  Five-star, five-star, five-star, five-star, five-star, five-star, five-star, five-star.
[01:38:27.068 --> 01:38:29.611]  We got contacted by this big third-party review site.
[01:38:29.631 --> 01:38:32.755]  They said, we've never seen anything like this.
[01:38:33.136 --> 01:38:34.197]  They even went and watched.
[01:38:34.918 --> 01:38:38.799]  With their IP addresses and thought maybe we were just doing it or something.
[01:38:38.839 --> 01:38:40.680]  No, it's real people with these reviews.
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:42.661]  They've never seen anything like it.
[01:38:43.041 --> 01:38:51.004]  Thousands of reviews, hundreds per product, 99% review for InfoWarsLife.com products.
[01:38:52.464 --> 01:38:54.045]  That's because they're revolutionary.
[01:38:54.445 --> 01:38:55.285]  I'm going to warn you!
[01:38:56.286 --> 01:39:03.028]  Consult your physician before you take Supermale Vitality, Superfemale Vitality, or before you take Naciniodine.
[01:39:05.370 --> 01:39:09.554]  Because the results, with myself and everybody else I've talked to, are dramatic.
[01:39:10.054 --> 01:39:11.416]  And sometimes they're serious.
[01:39:12.457 --> 01:39:18.342]  I mean, you don't have any iodine in you, you get the real source, it's gonna push out of your thyroid all that crap.
[01:39:18.803 --> 01:39:20.725]  And you're gonna feel like you got run over by an 18-wheeler.
[01:39:22.867 --> 01:39:24.348]  Most people do in about 2-3 weeks.
[01:39:25.229 --> 01:39:29.433]  And then after that, I liken it when I've carried, when my kids were little, up
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:34.224]  You know, a hill, a mountain, 300, 400 yards up steps like Mount Bonnell.
[01:39:34.965 --> 01:39:37.227]  My daughter on my shoulders or my son when he was smaller.
[01:39:37.247 --> 01:39:40.070]  And when you take them off your shoulders, you feel like you're flying.
[01:39:41.371 --> 01:39:44.194]  After about a month on X2, that's what it was like.
[01:39:44.514 --> 01:39:46.256]  And I've been more crazed, more energy.
[01:39:46.476 --> 01:39:47.377]  I've been on it two years.
[01:39:47.857 --> 01:39:49.018]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:39:50.765 --> 01:39:51.726]  Alright, I'm done ranting.
[01:39:52.446 --> 01:39:54.868]  Please support our local Eminem affiliates as well.
[01:39:55.929 --> 01:39:58.211]  Please support their local sponsors or become a sponsor.
[01:39:58.492 --> 01:40:00.433]  That is key and integral as well.
[01:40:01.414 --> 01:40:09.060]  And realize the system's doing everything it can right now to censor, to demonize, to assassinate my character, to demonize us, to shut us down.
[01:40:09.561 --> 01:40:12.043]  I don't give the enemy any attention, but believe me, they're very active.
[01:40:12.523 --> 01:40:14.265]  I take that as a sign as I'm over the enemy.
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:16.361]  We're having an effect.
[01:40:17.041 --> 01:40:17.922]  We're drawing their fire.
[01:40:18.422 --> 01:40:20.203]  So when you support us, it's a win-win.
[01:40:20.223 --> 01:40:22.785]  You're funding the vicious tip of the spear.
[01:40:23.005 --> 01:40:23.706]  We are vicious.
[01:40:24.246 --> 01:40:25.327]  The globalists are scared of us.
[01:40:26.087 --> 01:40:29.610]  Because they're a bunch of criminal cowards running a con game that they're invincible.
[01:40:29.810 --> 01:40:30.810]  They know they're not invincible.
[01:40:31.311 --> 01:40:32.772]  Evil's failed every time in history.
[01:40:33.766 --> 01:40:35.928]  They think a bunch of high-tech stuff's gonna help them win?
[01:40:36.289 --> 01:40:37.550]  We've already identified them.
[01:40:38.151 --> 01:40:45.399]  Because of Barry Goldwater and Phyllis Schlafly and Red Beckman and all those folks 30, 40, 50 years ago.
[01:40:45.419 --> 01:40:45.879]  60 years ago.
[01:40:48.547 --> 01:40:50.529]  And now everything they warned of is coming true.
[01:40:50.749 --> 01:40:51.490]  We held it back.
[01:40:51.550 --> 01:40:52.170]  We held it back.
[01:40:52.471 --> 01:40:53.291]  We held a lot of it back.
[01:40:53.351 --> 01:40:55.293]  Now we, we, but we're sliding backwards.
[01:40:55.313 --> 01:40:56.094]  We just slowed it down.
[01:40:56.715 --> 01:40:57.916]  Now we've gone over the cliff.
[01:40:57.936 --> 01:40:59.477]  People are going, whoa, really?
[01:40:59.517 --> 01:41:00.718]  You were telling the truth about all this.
[01:41:01.039 --> 01:41:03.721]  Ah, at least we can pull the parachute now.
[01:41:04.001 --> 01:41:07.224]  Collectively, if we realize what's happening and have a soft landing.
[01:41:07.264 --> 01:41:08.886]  So we salute all of you out there.
[01:41:10.106 --> 01:41:13.608]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:41:13.628 --> 01:41:22.494]  But we've had these third-party review sites for about a year and a half, and people kept saying, Alex, why don't you read the reviews?
[01:41:22.514 --> 01:41:23.295]  Why don't you mention the reviews?
[01:41:23.315 --> 01:41:24.376]  And I just was busy and didn't.
[01:41:26.437 --> 01:41:27.298]  I mean, I know it's good.
[01:41:27.358 --> 01:41:32.561]  I know I'm getting great calls and emails and family, and I'm getting great results, but then I guess that is what sells products.
[01:41:32.581 --> 01:41:36.224]  I mean, if anybody else had a 99 review right on third, and it's not just that site.
[01:41:36.524 --> 01:41:37.925]  It's a bunch of other review sites.
[01:41:39.065 --> 01:41:50.632]  Major, I mean, the big snoots, the experts on nutraceuticals, you know, the snooty folks that are really experts that are into it, the hippies are buying it, folks.
[01:41:51.553 --> 01:41:56.936]  The hippies love our products, because they understand it's hard core.
[01:41:57.517 --> 01:42:02.420]  I mean, the super male vitality and female vitality is concentrated organic, cold-pressed,
[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:09.762]  And then condensed, it's a secret process, I'm not allowed to talk about it, but a lot, some of it's patented, we gotta pay for the machines and all that stuff.
[01:42:10.142 --> 01:42:11.522]  It's concentrated, folks.
[01:42:11.922 --> 01:42:13.042]  It's concentrated.
[01:42:13.843 --> 01:42:26.245]  And quite frankly, it's a form of alchemy, and we don't mean turning lead into gold, it's, it's, but they follow alchemaic principles of recombining, mixing, I mean, Group is a weirdo, in a good way.
[01:42:26.285 --> 01:42:32.287]  He's coming on next hour, InfoWarsLife.com, and take the Super Mill Vitality, see what it does for you.
[01:42:33.208 --> 01:42:34.069]  Okay, I'm done ranting.
[01:42:34.749 --> 01:42:37.851]  Joining us, back safely, thank the Lord, thank you for your prayers.
[01:42:38.412 --> 01:42:40.974]  They were raiding journalists at, you know, 1 a.m.
[01:42:40.994 --> 01:42:42.755]  in the morning like Charlie Skelton on The Guardian.
[01:42:43.055 --> 01:42:44.096]  That's a pretty bold move.
[01:42:44.116 --> 01:42:52.742]  They were attack helicopters, armored vehicles, checkpoints six miles away, cops grabbing on due for walking up to them and being polite.
[01:42:54.143 --> 01:43:01.188]  They're back from Bilderberg, but look at how a world government, TPP, the Pope calling for world government.
[01:43:02.307 --> 01:43:07.892]  A global authority for carbon taxes, making their move on every single front.
[01:43:09.614 --> 01:43:14.759]  We see the Bilderberg group, and I believe it's because the agenda is stalling.
[01:43:15.119 --> 01:43:18.822]  They've decided to go from stealth to out in the open and try to bum rush us.
[01:43:20.544 --> 01:43:23.787]  I know Bilderberg's probably not too happy the TPP got shot down last Friday.
[01:43:24.247 --> 01:43:27.671]  Then the big day was Sunday when they left.
[01:43:28.711 --> 01:43:29.711]  And they got swarmed.
[01:43:29.751 --> 01:43:39.434]  If radio listeners haven't seen the videos of world leaders being confronted at the airport by our reporters and others and locals that came out, that was simply amazing.
[01:43:39.474 --> 01:43:41.135]  Gentlemen, great job.
[01:43:41.155 --> 01:43:42.175]  Good to have you back in Austin.
[01:43:42.595 --> 01:43:43.175]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:43:43.276 --> 01:43:44.936]  And look at the Steve Watson article.
[01:43:45.016 --> 01:43:51.238]  Taxpayers foot $128,000 for Michelle's sightseeing trip for a secret party with Prince and Stevie Wonder.
[01:43:51.658 --> 01:43:54.919]  We're still living under what they were doing at Bilderberg there to the Austrians.
[01:43:55.439 --> 01:43:58.561]  Secret parties, secret trips, sightseeing.
[01:43:58.601 --> 01:43:59.381]  Taxpayer paid for.
[01:43:59.401 --> 01:44:00.161]  We're paying for, yeah.
[01:44:00.201 --> 01:44:01.962]  We're paying for all that for them to have a good time.
[01:44:02.042 --> 01:44:03.362]  And then the media says it doesn't exist.
[01:44:03.602 --> 01:44:04.063]  Exactly.
[01:44:04.583 --> 01:44:06.804]  And, you know, you'd be a conspiracy theorist for talking about it.
[01:44:06.824 --> 01:44:09.845]  But yeah, you know, we beat them in the first round with TPP.
[01:44:09.925 --> 01:44:12.225]  It looks like they're going to come back and try to vote on it again.
[01:44:12.306 --> 01:44:13.366]  And it seems like they didn't like
[01:44:13.826 --> 01:44:15.567]  Josh Owens, what do you make of all this?
[01:44:15.587 --> 01:44:19.008]  I mean, I can ask specific questions, but just out of the gates, what did you take away from Bilderberg 2015?
[01:44:34.133 --> 01:44:35.495]  Well, we covered a lot while we were there.
[01:44:35.555 --> 01:44:36.576]  Obviously, people saw that.
[01:44:36.596 --> 01:44:40.440]  I think the big story is what happens behind the closed doors.
[01:44:41.021 --> 01:44:44.144]  And the biggest part of it is drawing attention to that.
[01:44:44.445 --> 01:44:54.316]  We had dinner with a journalist, and I'm not going to say his name because he was talking in confidence, but he actually told us that he doesn't usually get put on stories that are conspiracy theories like this.
[01:44:54.816 --> 01:45:05.342]  Even while he was there, when he saw the cops that were there, he saw the checkpoints that were put up, he saw the people actually driving into the hotel.
[01:45:05.962 --> 01:45:07.643]  It was still considered a conspiracy theory.
[01:45:07.663 --> 01:45:08.684]  I think the big point is that
[01:45:09.710 --> 01:45:20.661]  The more that the shadows are lifted and the more attention that is drawn to it, we'll see that hopefully, I'm sure some will still call it a conspiracy theory, but there's nothing theoretical about it.
[01:45:21.201 --> 01:45:25.385]  Sure, there's something conspiratorial about it because there are people dictating inside of a hotel in secret.
[01:45:25.405 --> 01:45:26.146]  I mean, we know that
[01:45:28.528 --> 01:45:31.332]  It played an integral part in creating the Euro.
[01:45:31.753 --> 01:45:37.040]  So we know that real things happen, real things are created, real things are dictated, real things are done behind those doors.
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:44.310]  And when Dew and the guy that we met down there, Tillman, confronted these people, I think that's a huge deal because
[01:45:45.151 --> 01:45:59.621]  Not only do the people who are watching the show, who are paying attention, reading the articles, know what's going on, the people inside the building, the people behind the doors, know that we're there, know that there are real questions to be asked, and I think that's the biggest thing to take away from the entire week.
[01:45:59.721 --> 01:46:10.588]  Yeah, we confronted their countrymen there, as they thought they could slip in and get a coffee real quick before they caught their plane, and I saw their media head, their Austrian media mogul, essentially, walking in.
[01:46:10.628 --> 01:46:11.509]  I said, we gotta go get him.
[01:46:11.589 --> 01:46:13.410]  He's the biggest in Austria.
[01:46:13.530 --> 01:46:14.931]  TV, radio, print.
[01:46:15.592 --> 01:46:16.033]  I don't think so.
[01:46:20.538 --> 01:46:23.501]  Again, you're supposed to just be little sheeple that don't recognize who they are.
[01:46:23.541 --> 01:46:24.722]  He's the equivalent of Rupert Murdoch.
[01:46:24.842 --> 01:46:26.323]  And then two of their big bankers as well.
[01:46:26.363 --> 01:46:30.947]  These are two of their central bankers where they're getting together, trying to get a little coffee in before they left.
[01:46:31.347 --> 01:46:33.429]  The one guy was starting to take pictures of my face.
[01:46:33.449 --> 01:46:34.049]  Who are you?
[01:46:34.130 --> 01:46:34.530]  Who are you?
[01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:35.230]  Where are you from?
[01:46:35.250 --> 01:46:36.592]  I'll tell you who I am, where I'm from.
[01:46:36.632 --> 01:46:37.272]  Doesn't bother me.
[01:46:37.292 --> 01:46:38.153]  What are you going to do?
[01:46:38.173 --> 01:46:38.974]  Yeah, like we're scared.
[01:46:39.014 --> 01:46:39.894]  We're not intimidated.
[01:46:40.375 --> 01:46:41.796]  And let's expand on that.
[01:46:41.836 --> 01:46:42.957]  Charlie Skelton raised this.
[01:46:43.057 --> 01:46:43.477]  Others did.
[01:46:43.497 --> 01:46:47.160]  We need to do a final article about Bilderberg caught in criminal activity.
[01:46:47.981 --> 01:46:53.703]  You had the heads of HSBC, their top three people, that's indicted in all this money laundering trouble.
[01:46:54.363 --> 01:47:00.525]  They're with the EU and UK heads of enforcement, the exchequer.
[01:47:02.005 --> 01:47:04.906]  You know, the head of their, that's their Secretary of the Treasury.
[01:47:05.867 --> 01:47:07.967]  They're meeting with the people they've indicted.
[01:47:08.788 --> 01:47:09.248]  Secretly.
[01:47:09.308 --> 01:47:11.568]  I mean, no wonder they want to keep you back six miles.
[01:47:11.829 --> 01:47:15.870]  This is total mafia meeting, like the famous meeting they caught, you know, in the
[01:47:16.721 --> 01:47:19.743]  Countryside of New Jersey where the FBI called the mob in the farmhouse?
[01:47:19.883 --> 01:47:20.103]  Right.
[01:47:21.324 --> 01:47:22.364]  I mean, that's what this is.
[01:47:22.824 --> 01:47:23.905]  Yeah, basically.
[01:47:23.925 --> 01:47:30.269]  And then there's a Rennie Banco who's a guy who had a suspended sentence for fraud and embezzling money and doing all these crazy deals.
[01:47:30.289 --> 01:47:30.609]  It's bribery.
[01:47:30.629 --> 01:47:31.329]  It's bribery, yeah.
[01:47:31.930 --> 01:47:33.590]  And he was allowed to go to this.
[01:47:33.931 --> 01:47:39.654]  It's like, we're going to let the criminals come in, we're going to keep everybody else out, and we don't want you asking questions or getting near these people.
[01:47:40.054 --> 01:47:43.495]  They just had a fit at the airport when we were getting in front of them, watching them.
[01:47:43.775 --> 01:47:44.936]  And I've got some video footage.
[01:47:44.976 --> 01:47:50.058]  I haven't figured out who this guy is yet, but he was one of the Bilderbergers looking for his passport or his conscience.
[01:47:50.098 --> 01:47:50.358]  I don't know.
[01:47:50.378 --> 01:47:50.838]  He's digging around.
[01:47:50.858 --> 01:47:51.759]  I saw you put the tweet out.
[01:47:51.779 --> 01:47:52.919]  You said, hell, who is this?
[01:47:52.959 --> 01:47:53.339]  Yeah.
[01:47:53.459 --> 01:47:54.119]  Who is this guy?
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:55.520]  I think he's French or Turkish.
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:48:00.202]  What about Wolfdenson talked to Luke and folks from We Are Change?
[01:48:00.242 --> 01:48:00.442]  Yeah.
[01:48:00.602 --> 01:48:02.543]  And he goes, I did not go to Bilderberg.
[01:48:02.783 --> 01:48:04.043]  Former head of the World Bank.
[01:48:04.243 --> 01:48:04.444]  Yeah.
[01:48:04.484 --> 01:48:05.584]  He goes, I didn't go to Bilderberg.
[01:48:05.744 --> 01:48:06.164]  What are you doing?
[01:48:06.184 --> 01:48:07.505]  He's like getting out of one of their vehicles.
[01:48:08.305 --> 01:48:09.906]  It's a small town, comparatively.
[01:48:11.107 --> 01:48:12.268]  I saw photos and video.
[01:48:12.888 --> 01:48:15.030]  I've never seen an airport in the mountains like that.
[01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:16.971]  That looked like Star Wars.
[01:48:17.071 --> 01:48:25.597]  Literally a river valley that was cut out, and you guys can run some of the footage that I put up there, but a river valley that was cut out by a glacier millions of years ago.
[01:48:25.657 --> 01:48:26.197]  It's flat.
[01:48:26.217 --> 01:48:28.879]  It's the only area that's flat, and you're surrounded by mountains.
[01:48:28.899 --> 01:48:32.241]  There's the guy that I need help identifying, and I'll find him.
[01:48:32.261 --> 01:48:35.303]  I just didn't have a chance to go through the entire list and put a name to a face.
[01:48:35.323 --> 01:48:36.244]  He's probably one of the lesser
[01:48:36.724 --> 01:48:37.284]  We're good to go.
[01:49:00.650 --> 01:49:04.914]  Continue to... Yeah, just the scenery around that area was amazing.
[01:49:04.954 --> 01:49:06.816]  It's the most beautiful place I've ever been on Earth.
[01:49:06.836 --> 01:49:10.639]  And I've been to Switzerland, I've been to the Caribbean, but... You lived in Switzerland?
[01:49:10.799 --> 01:49:12.120]  I lived there for a few months, yeah.
[01:49:12.221 --> 01:49:15.103]  The mountains there in Austria were just totally amazing.
[01:49:15.163 --> 01:49:19.247]  Even in the summertime, they still had snow on them, but just beautiful grass.
[01:49:19.267 --> 01:49:20.208]  They had lots of rain.
[01:49:20.528 --> 01:49:24.712]  You could actually watch the trees just take the moisture and then expel it out during the day.
[01:49:24.732 --> 01:49:25.853]  It's the land of crumb!
[01:49:26.573 --> 01:49:26.994]  Pretty much.
[01:49:27.634 --> 01:49:34.777]  Well, and looking at the history, I found some old history book at the place we were at, just looking at the old pictures that people had spent, you know, probably months making.
[01:49:35.137 --> 01:49:40.939]  And I did a whole little video on that, and, you know, showing the glaciers that were in existence in the 1800s, but then melted away.
[01:49:41.239 --> 01:49:43.460]  But we didn't, you know, it wasn't SUVs that melted them away in the 1800s.
[01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:48.182]  That's right, they have news articles about how it used to be permafrost there, but now it isn't.
[01:49:48.382 --> 01:49:48.602]  Right.
[01:49:48.822 --> 01:49:49.883]  And that's in the 1800s.
[01:49:49.903 --> 01:49:52.124]  These horses were, like, right next to my cabin.
[01:49:52.524 --> 01:49:58.567]  I had a little cabin on the hill, and these are like these world-famous miniature bred horses that were out there.
[01:49:58.647 --> 01:50:03.230]  And every day they'd just go out and eat and walk around, and I'd feed them apples every once in a while.
[01:50:03.410 --> 01:50:11.274]  And, you know, in addition to finding people walking through, I interviewed this English couple that walked through, and they were terrorized by the cops.
[01:50:11.554 --> 01:50:12.315]  Two days in a row.
[01:50:12.995 --> 01:50:16.438]  The second day we got them is we were doing a report at the gates and they came riding by.
[01:50:16.478 --> 01:50:17.399]  Josh, we're going to come back.
[01:50:17.419 --> 01:50:18.660]  What else do you want to get into?
[01:50:19.041 --> 01:50:21.783]  I mean, I really think globalism's reached its peak.
[01:50:22.304 --> 01:50:23.805]  Now it's the beginning of the decline.
[01:50:24.045 --> 01:50:29.110]  Because the minute they go public with a takeover, they've always had to keep it secret because it'll fail.
[01:50:29.451 --> 01:50:32.814]  It's totally illegitimate to be ruled by foreign secret boards.
[01:50:33.394 --> 01:50:35.977]  I don't care if Paul Ryan says it's wonderful with a straight face.
[01:50:37.259 --> 01:50:37.639]  Exactly.
[01:50:37.679 --> 01:50:41.901]  And regardless of what people think about it now, I mean, the more that's put out about it, the better it is.
[01:50:41.961 --> 01:50:47.144]  The more that people see, the more that people, you know, almost experience what we're seeing out there.
[01:50:47.684 --> 01:50:48.624]  It's a huge deal.
[01:50:48.664 --> 01:50:53.627]  I mean, it's almost hard to put into words how big of a deal it is that
[01:50:54.910 --> 01:50:56.611]  They were actually confronted on the last day.
[01:50:56.951 --> 01:51:02.954]  They were actually... They came into that restaurant up there, and they were... These are some of the best confrontations ever.
[01:51:02.974 --> 01:51:06.195]  I mean, you guys did a great job, but you got an A-plus there at the end.
[01:51:06.335 --> 01:51:08.156]  I mean, it really paid off exposing the scum.
[01:51:10.299 --> 01:51:14.365]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:14.405 --> 01:51:17.409]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:17.589 --> 01:51:18.951]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:19.231 --> 01:51:22.276]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:22.576 --> 01:51:23.517]  Infidel Body Armor.

[01:51:43.845 --> 01:51:45.126]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[01:53:08.665 --> 01:53:09.545]  Call today.
[01:53:10.146 --> 01:53:11.847]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:53:12.087 --> 01:53:15.389]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:53:15.709 --> 01:53:16.690]  A pair of scissors.
[01:53:17.070 --> 01:53:22.573]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[01:53:22.853 --> 01:53:27.536]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[01:53:27.776 --> 01:53:28.557]  The phone line.
[01:53:28.757 --> 01:53:33.658]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:53:33.998 --> 01:53:37.779]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:53:37.919 --> 01:53:40.799]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[01:53:41.219 --> 01:53:43.480]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:47.881]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[01:53:48.041 --> 01:53:51.561]  Scissors can't cut it, and that means your home stays safe.
[01:53:51.581 --> 01:53:55.182]  24-7 professional monitoring is under $15 a month with no contract.

[01:54:13.689 --> 01:54:23.512]  As I said earlier, Alex Jones here back live.
[01:54:24.013 --> 01:54:24.893]  Pope Francis.
[01:54:26.954 --> 01:54:31.296]  He got worshipped by mainstream media right away after the last pope had to leave over scandal.
[01:54:32.816 --> 01:54:33.637]  He's a Jesuit.
[01:54:33.877 --> 01:54:34.837]  They're not supposed to be pope.
[01:54:35.898 --> 01:54:37.298]  That's the guardians of the church.
[01:54:37.318 --> 01:54:39.679]  They're not supposed to be involved in it, just protecting it.
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:43.981]  So that violates basic Catholic doctrine for 400 years.
[01:54:45.142 --> 01:54:50.504]  And now when I saw CNN, MSNBC worshipping him, when they had been bashing Catholics incessantly,
[01:54:51.468 --> 01:54:55.810]  After they infiltrated the Catholic Church and carried out all their socialism and communism.
[01:54:56.150 --> 01:54:57.951]  To see him worshipped, I said, look out!
[01:54:58.531 --> 01:55:02.673]  And now, carbon taxes, global government, the articles on Infowars.com.
[01:55:03.013 --> 01:55:06.395]  Pope calls for global authority to impose climate change agenda.
[01:55:06.695 --> 01:55:10.116]  Carbon taxes, regulations, make the rich nations pay.
[01:55:10.497 --> 01:55:15.359]  The last time we got the Copenhagen Treaty, five years ago, it actually basically doubled taxes on the third world.
[01:55:16.420 --> 01:55:22.344]  So sell austerity to the third world that Obama talked about, telling Africans you can't have cars or air conditioning.
[01:55:22.845 --> 01:55:24.886]  Sell it as get back at Rich Whitey.
[01:55:25.767 --> 01:55:27.548]  And then he says rich nations are the problem.
[01:55:28.068 --> 01:55:29.529]  I mean, this guy's from South America.
[01:55:29.850 --> 01:55:31.271]  They have giant populations.
[01:55:32.191 --> 01:55:34.212]  They have high technology, but they're corrupt.
[01:55:34.593 --> 01:55:35.753]  How is that my fault?
[01:55:36.274 --> 01:55:46.060]  This is class warfare from a guy that lives in one of the biggest palaces in the world, and an institution that has so much wealth, it may be the richest institution in the world.
[01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:50.323]  Why is it always ultra-rich talking about how the middle class is evil?
[01:55:51.414 --> 01:55:52.774]  I mean, something's going on here.
[01:55:52.814 --> 01:55:54.995]  What do you make of it, and how it ties into Bilderberg?
[01:55:55.015 --> 01:55:58.096]  You know, it was the Vatican that pushed an EU program.
[01:55:58.416 --> 01:56:01.337]  In fact, the first treaty to set up the EU was called the Treaty of Rome.
[01:56:01.617 --> 01:56:11.399]  Yeah, and that's like Obama going to Africa and telling the Africans, hey, we can't all have air conditioning, we can't all have cars, trying to make them feel bad for wanting to up themselves, up their standard of living.
[01:56:11.459 --> 01:56:13.520]  That's what they're, they're always looking at our standard of living.
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:17.521]  He lands in a giant jet with 10 jets with him, tens of millions of dollars a day,
[01:56:18.661 --> 01:56:19.702]  And then lectures everyone.
[01:56:19.782 --> 01:56:20.463]  But we're bad.
[01:56:20.643 --> 01:56:22.104]  You know, we're walking on a mountain.
[01:56:22.204 --> 01:56:27.968]  Al Gore has 17 properties, eight or nine houses, some of them are 40,000 square feet.
[01:56:28.328 --> 01:56:33.171]  Yeah, it's totally mind-blowing how these people, they're just, they just talk out of two sides of their mouth.
[01:56:33.191 --> 01:56:36.754]  He's got Bentleys, he's got Jets, he's got everything, but we can't have anything.
[01:56:37.034 --> 01:56:37.274]  Right.
[01:56:37.574 --> 01:56:41.115]  We're supposed to live in squalor, and then we're supposed to want that squalor now.
[01:56:41.175 --> 01:56:48.477]  Now they're trying to train us into living in smaller apartments, driving smaller cars, while they drive in huge, giant, you know, armored vehicles.
[01:56:48.837 --> 01:56:50.677]  They drive in, they fly in giant planes.
[01:56:50.697 --> 01:56:53.858]  They want to cram us in smaller and smaller in some of these airline seats.
[01:56:54.258 --> 01:56:56.018]  And now they want to fly people standing up.
[01:56:56.078 --> 01:56:58.339]  They want to make you stand up while you- While they block!
[01:56:59.748 --> 01:57:06.651]  It's a world of less quality, a negative sum, while they block real clean energy and then only roll out boondoggles that don't work.
[01:57:07.011 --> 01:57:13.014]  They know windmills 200 miles from where they're going lose half the power and are worthless and use more carbon.
[01:57:13.314 --> 01:57:16.436]  They know electric cars use more carbon than a regular gas car.
[01:57:17.336 --> 01:57:18.257]  It's all a fraud.
[01:57:18.277 --> 01:57:19.158]  It's all a big joke.
[01:57:19.678 --> 01:57:23.721]  They're suppressing technology while endangering the earth with GMO.
[01:57:24.121 --> 01:57:36.571]  And I think that's why we're here, to wake people up to that fact that, hey, these people are trying to tell us that we have to live in squalor and we have to be poor while they're rich and they're good, they're better than us for some reason because they're telling us that we're poor.
[01:57:36.951 --> 01:57:38.232]  It's just a paradox.
[01:57:38.272 --> 01:57:39.233]  It's a real paradox.
[01:57:39.273 --> 01:57:40.173]  Well, they flip reality.
[01:57:40.193 --> 01:57:40.754]  They're con men.
[01:57:40.834 --> 01:57:41.014]  Yeah.
[01:57:41.474 --> 01:57:42.295]  It's all a con game.
[01:57:42.335 --> 01:57:43.456]  There's no death panels.
[01:57:43.496 --> 01:57:44.537]  It doesn't increase your prices.
[01:57:44.777 --> 01:57:45.558]  You can keep your doctor.
[01:57:46.498 --> 01:57:50.679]  Meanwhile, we have the Nazi death machine giving out health care for veterans.
[01:57:50.839 --> 01:57:56.021]  Yeah, I'm going to have that added to that great report that they put together on Jade Helm, finally decoded.
[01:57:56.341 --> 01:57:59.962]  You know, just to add, by the way, this Watson machine now is over the no-treat list for the vets.
[01:58:01.242 --> 01:58:04.303]  Now they're trying to make it through Obamacare that your doctor takes orders from.
[01:58:04.463 --> 01:58:05.944]  And we've got whistleblowers confirming.
[01:58:06.104 --> 01:58:08.144]  This is how the robots are going to kill us, not like Terminator.
[01:58:10.686 --> 01:58:11.927]  You know, skeleton robots.
[01:58:12.007 --> 01:58:15.350]  It's going to be loving little IBM robots going, you don't get treatment.
[01:58:15.951 --> 01:58:17.412]  And it's okay because liberals did it.
[01:58:17.632 --> 01:58:18.853]  Liberal, liberal.
[01:58:19.214 --> 01:58:21.055]  Isn't that fun to do that?
[01:58:21.075 --> 01:58:22.196]  We had a lot of that.
[01:58:22.417 --> 01:58:24.999]  You know, we saw a lot of that liberal mentality there in Austria.
[01:58:25.019 --> 01:58:32.346]  But one thing I do want to point out, there were some great activists that came from all over the place, just because some of them took vacation time.
[01:58:32.366 --> 01:58:36.429]  Oh look, USA Today, VA recruits IBM's Watson to aid them.
[01:58:37.330 --> 01:58:38.551]  Just like it aided Hitler.
[01:58:39.052 --> 01:58:40.413]  Oh, we're aiding you.
[01:58:40.893 --> 01:58:42.135]  We're aiding you.
[01:58:42.815 --> 01:58:43.175]  Oh.
[01:58:44.076 --> 01:58:46.959]  IBM was created to carry out eugenics on record.
[01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:50.262]  All its money goes into a foundation to carry this out.
[01:58:50.963 --> 01:58:51.803]  I mean, it is the AI.
[01:58:51.963 --> 01:58:54.085]  It's behind Google, it's behind Microsoft, everything.
[01:58:54.105 --> 01:58:55.206]  It's the takeover.
[01:58:55.787 --> 01:58:56.768]  IBM runs it all.
[01:58:57.108 --> 01:58:57.729]  We'll be back.
[01:58:57.789 --> 01:58:58.810]  Five more minutes with our guest.
[01:59:00.041 --> 01:59:05.823]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[01:59:06.143 --> 01:59:10.444]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.

[01:59:18.686 --> 01:59:23.908]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.

[01:59:35.113 --> 01:59:38.715]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[01:59:39.055 --> 01:59:45.258]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[01:59:45.658 --> 01:59:50.644]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[01:59:50.804 --> 01:59:54.368]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.

[01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:57.952]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:15.851 --> 02:00:16.492]  Big Brother.
[02:00:17.153 --> 02:00:18.194]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:18.935 --> 02:00:20.016]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:20.677 --> 02:00:21.498]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.279 --> 02:00:23.160]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.180 --> 02:00:27.846]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.986 --> 02:00:32.091]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.631 --> 02:00:35.114]  We take you now live to Austin, Texas.
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:42.563]  I had Phyllis Schlafly at Eagle Farm on, a libertarian conservative icon, and she said it really is awesome, the take-up.
[02:00:43.043 --> 02:00:49.205]  It's awesome they tried to have a secret legislation to just make the president a dictator, ram through the TPP.
[02:00:49.606 --> 02:00:51.386]  It's awesome these globalists meet in secret.
[02:00:51.426 --> 02:00:56.008]  It's awesome they advertise, come to America, have your baby for free, get welfare.
[02:00:56.309 --> 02:00:59.690]  No one else does that, and if you're against it, well England does.
[02:01:00.530 --> 02:01:01.551]  If you're against it, you're evil.
[02:01:02.577 --> 02:01:11.384]  If you don't let hordes of illegals by the thousands a day jump on cars and rob them and steal them and drive them into the UK through the tunnel, then you're a racist.
[02:01:13.686 --> 02:01:19.911]  I mean, this is the craziness that's going on and unfolding, and I just wonder, when does it hit bottom?
[02:01:20.331 --> 02:01:21.192]  How far will it go?
[02:01:21.432 --> 02:01:23.334]  The globalists are taking over by doing this?
[02:01:24.134 --> 02:01:30.039]  Meanwhile, they have to get armored redoubts in the middle of the Caribbean and the middle of the Pacific Ocean to hide?
[02:01:32.031 --> 02:01:42.538]  I mean, there is a method to their madness, but at the same time, they just can't help stealing everything, and they can't help screwing everything up, because they're in the management positions and can make money off the response to the crisis.
[02:01:42.598 --> 02:01:43.159]  Josh Owens.
[02:01:43.799 --> 02:01:44.179]  Absolutely.
[02:01:44.219 --> 02:01:47.401]  These agendas, these globalist agendas, are pushed every day that humans are bad.
[02:01:47.782 --> 02:01:48.562]  And I'm going to say this.
[02:01:49.003 --> 02:01:56.127]  I think, in Bilderberg, one thing that I noticed is that the cops, the checkpoints, the being treated like we were filth, it happened, I mean,
[02:01:57.128 --> 02:01:58.509]  The second we got there, it started.
[02:01:58.829 --> 02:02:01.471]  And it happened until we left, everywhere we went.
[02:02:02.032 --> 02:02:09.057]  And when I got home, driving into work this morning, I almost, in my mind, it was like, well, I guess I'm going to go through a checkpoint this morning.
[02:02:09.097 --> 02:02:09.878]  You were being conditioned.
[02:02:09.978 --> 02:02:10.518]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:02:10.558 --> 02:02:11.979]  You get used to it so quickly.
[02:02:12.019 --> 02:02:15.222]  And I don't think people realize that when they're not living in it specifically.
[02:02:15.262 --> 02:02:16.823]  It's not affecting their lives every day.
[02:02:17.243 --> 02:02:23.728]  But I think people need to know how fast it can happen and how quickly your mind can switch on to think, well, this is just something I have to put up with.
[02:02:23.928 --> 02:02:25.009]  This is just something I have to deal with.
[02:02:25.069 --> 02:02:26.490]  Yeah, it doesn't mean you like it.
[02:02:26.610 --> 02:02:30.112]  You, you, as that globalist told me once off record, you don't get it.
[02:02:30.372 --> 02:02:31.873]  You think you're going to evolve and overcome.
[02:02:31.913 --> 02:02:33.954]  We're going to make you evolve to submit.
[02:02:34.314 --> 02:02:34.754]  Exactly.
[02:02:34.954 --> 02:02:38.316]  And they took over that whole town, the little town of Telfts, in like three days.
[02:02:38.456 --> 02:02:38.656]  Boom.
[02:02:38.696 --> 02:02:39.557]  They set up checkpoints.
[02:02:39.577 --> 02:02:40.757]  They were running people through it.
[02:02:41.097 --> 02:02:41.738]  We talked to the people.
[02:02:41.758 --> 02:02:42.658]  Had you gone to the checkpoint?
[02:02:42.698 --> 02:02:45.660]  Almost everyone we talked to had gone through the checkpoint at one time or another.
[02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:47.401]  And it wasn't, it was right at the edge of town.
[02:02:47.421 --> 02:02:50.242]  It wasn't even in the town, but they were being conditioned to submit.
[02:02:50.582 --> 02:02:53.204]  And there's a guy asking, Oh, Texas, pull over.
[02:02:53.624 --> 02:02:55.766]  Well, the second he heard, he saw we were from Texas.
[02:02:55.826 --> 02:02:58.189]  He wanted to pull over, got their hands on their guns.
[02:02:58.229 --> 02:03:02.233]  That's like their first position is hand on the gun, looking at you menacingly.
[02:03:02.293 --> 02:03:03.314]  This is Jade Helm.
[02:03:03.474 --> 02:03:05.116]  This is what we're being introduced to.
[02:03:05.476 --> 02:03:07.458]  Global police state standardization.
[02:03:07.538 --> 02:03:11.322]  Yeah, and people are like, why don't you just tell the cops what you're... Well, you didn't have a chance.
[02:03:11.362 --> 02:03:13.124]  And one thing, I don't answer the cops.
[02:03:13.184 --> 02:03:14.566]  I don't give them any information.
[02:03:15.066 --> 02:03:16.867]  If they ask for my passport, I give them my passport.
[02:03:16.907 --> 02:03:18.709]  If they ask for a booking paper, I give them the booking paper.
[02:03:18.729 --> 02:03:24.032]  I don't start just throwing information out at them, because you say anything to these cops, it can be used against you.
[02:03:24.112 --> 02:03:26.974]  Well, people think groveling is what built America.
[02:03:27.034 --> 02:03:27.174]  Yeah.
[02:03:27.555 --> 02:03:29.156]  Groveling is what built slaves.
[02:03:29.907 --> 02:03:32.389]  Groveling is what has created what Austria is now.
[02:03:32.909 --> 02:03:34.530]  And those are a captured people.
[02:03:34.590 --> 02:03:38.652]  I feel really bad for them because they're a lot of nice people, but they just love to submit to the tyranny.
[02:03:38.672 --> 02:03:40.574]  You mean the people who are under Hitler are captured?
[02:03:40.794 --> 02:03:41.014]  Yeah.
[02:03:41.454 --> 02:03:43.776]  Their countries got captured after World War II.
[02:03:44.396 --> 02:03:46.117]  And they've never gone out of that.
[02:03:46.257 --> 02:03:47.698]  They're still submitting.
[02:03:48.259 --> 02:03:50.741]  They're like, if I just do my job, I'll be okay.
[02:03:51.021 --> 02:03:51.602]  I'll be okay.
[02:03:51.622 --> 02:03:54.064]  If I agree with the checkpoints, I'll just be okay.
[02:03:54.244 --> 02:03:58.467]  And now Germany's had to bail Greece out three times, and it's going bankrupt.
[02:03:58.948 --> 02:04:02.911]  And under socialism, it hates life so much, they've incentivized to have 1.2 kids.
[02:04:03.231 --> 02:04:05.273]  The good news is, the Germans have all committed suicide.
[02:04:05.293 --> 02:04:05.954]  There are none of you.
[02:04:06.734 --> 02:04:07.975]  Their populations are falling.
[02:04:08.916 --> 02:04:09.777]  Knock yourselves out!
[02:04:10.660 --> 02:04:18.624]  Yeah, it's just a totally amazing experience going there and contrasting the beautifulness of the scenery and then just the total... You know what I've noticed?
[02:04:18.684 --> 02:04:20.185]  Patriots all have three or four kids.
[02:04:20.225 --> 02:04:21.466]  I've got three, you've got four.
[02:04:21.486 --> 02:04:25.868]  I don't care whether they're black, white, you know, Hispanic, whatever.
[02:04:26.228 --> 02:04:27.369]  And other people just giving up.
[02:04:27.409 --> 02:04:28.009]  And I don't want kids.
[02:04:28.049 --> 02:04:29.450]  I don't want to go watch TV all day.
[02:04:29.790 --> 02:04:30.711]  We are into life.
[02:04:30.771 --> 02:04:31.771]  We're normal humans.
[02:04:31.951 --> 02:04:32.512]  We're wild.
[02:04:32.812 --> 02:04:34.373]  We're undomesticated.
[02:04:34.513 --> 02:04:35.353]  We're in this cage.
[02:04:35.393 --> 02:04:36.014]  We know we're here.
[02:04:38.837 --> 02:04:42.259]  I had two guys take me up the mountain to show me where those great shots were, those overhead shots.
[02:04:42.699 --> 02:04:44.160]  One had three kids, one had four kids.
[02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:45.821]  And they're into freedom.
[02:04:46.181 --> 02:04:54.165]  Even though they live in Europe, they're still... One of them biked 300 kilometers just to get there because they want to see what's going on so they can go back and tell people that this is ridiculous.
[02:04:54.185 --> 02:04:55.906]  Yeah, they didn't bike to go watch a football game.
[02:04:55.926 --> 02:04:57.727]  They biked to see journalists fighting tyranny.
[02:04:57.747 --> 02:04:59.067]  They wanted to be part of something special.
[02:04:59.327 --> 02:05:00.368]  This is legendary.
[02:05:00.408 --> 02:05:01.168]  This is awesome.
[02:05:01.428 --> 02:05:02.109]  This is epic.
[02:05:02.389 --> 02:05:03.429]  Great job, crew.
[02:05:03.449 --> 02:05:05.831]  I want you to do a final report for tonight's news.
[02:05:06.271 --> 02:05:07.351]  Great job, gentlemen.
[02:05:07.371 --> 02:05:08.272]  We'll be back.
[02:05:11.258 --> 02:05:22.670]  ISIS, blatantly supported by John McCain and the Pentagon, and hesitantly supplied tanks, rocket launchers, missile and anti-aircraft systems in accidental airdrops.
[02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:27.075]  They're just sending arms, very frankly, although they need them very badly.
[02:05:27.115 --> 02:05:29.197]  They need anti-tank and anti-air weapons.
[02:05:30.037 --> 02:05:34.258]  ...is not going to change the situation on the ground and the massacre goes on.
[02:05:34.458 --> 02:05:41.620]  Now it has been confirmed that ISIS has stockpiled enough radioactive material to create weapons of mass destruction.
[02:05:42.020 --> 02:05:55.984]  In the ISIS magazine Dabiq, ISIS declared their intent to acquire a nuclear warhead from Pakistan with their billions of stolen funds, gobbled up as they ransacked banks and took control of oil fields across Iraq and Syria.
[02:05:56.264 --> 02:06:05.898]  ISIS claims that all they have to do is call on their leaders in Pakistan to purchase a nuclear device through weapons dealers with links to corrupt officials in the region.
[02:06:05.979 --> 02:06:08.002]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com

[02:06:40.556 --> 02:06:49.622]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:06:49.842 --> 02:06:53.344]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[02:07:09.435 --> 02:07:10.656]  Another major health threat.
[02:07:10.676 --> 02:07:15.579]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:07:15.679 --> 02:07:18.300]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:07:18.340 --> 02:07:25.104]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:07:25.385 --> 02:07:28.246]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:07:28.386 --> 02:07:31.288]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:07:31.308 --> 02:07:33.309]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:07:33.349 --> 02:07:36.171]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:07:36.271 --> 02:07:41.773]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:07:41.993 --> 02:07:45.474]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:07:45.494 --> 02:07:48.495]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:07:48.595 --> 02:07:55.697]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[02:08:06.241 --> 02:08:15.067]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[02:08:36.511 --> 02:08:38.276]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:38.677 --> 02:08:41.303]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:08:50.958 --> 02:08:55.301]  We're good to go.
[02:09:20.963 --> 02:09:32.218]  God bless them!
[02:09:32.579 --> 02:09:34.021]  Yeah!
[02:09:39.838 --> 02:09:41.719]  Here's the headlines coming up in more detail.
[02:09:42.279 --> 02:09:45.260]  Catholics attack Pope after climate change fear-mongering.
[02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:47.360]  Large number of Catholics slam Vatican's agenda.
[02:09:48.821 --> 02:09:50.341]  Total communism, I'll tell ya.
[02:09:50.501 --> 02:09:51.701]  And it's not even for the people.
[02:09:52.002 --> 02:09:52.802]  It's ridiculous.
[02:09:53.642 --> 02:09:55.983]  Putin says Russia's beefing up its nuclear arsenal.
[02:09:57.543 --> 02:09:59.604]  Things are really gearing up in a big way.
[02:10:00.964 --> 02:10:03.325]  Obama moves to continue to keep the borders open.
[02:10:03.665 --> 02:10:06.466]  And he's pushing Internet ID verification response system.
[02:10:06.486 --> 02:10:07.186]  I'm gonna hit that.
[02:10:08.336 --> 02:10:11.177]  We're going to look at Boko Haram.
[02:10:11.537 --> 02:10:12.057]  Now the U.S.
[02:10:12.077 --> 02:10:14.477]  has got to attack the group funded by the West.
[02:10:15.737 --> 02:10:21.158]  That is just some of what's coming up here today in this third hour.
[02:10:22.018 --> 02:10:35.421]  Joining us via video Skype, he was going to join us in person, but he had to drive up from South Texas, is Dr. Edward Group, one of the top formulators of supplements in the country, Army veteran, really great nutritionist and
[02:10:37.022 --> 02:10:41.343]  With so many other degrees that deal with health, chiropractor, you name it.
[02:10:42.423 --> 02:10:44.343]  But his knowledge is simply amazing.
[02:10:45.444 --> 02:10:48.824]  And I've had a lot of medical doctors on that break down and basically say the same things he's saying.
[02:10:49.825 --> 02:10:51.365]  Like Blaylock and so many others.
[02:10:53.425 --> 02:10:56.226]  But I wanted to tell a personal story here on air.
[02:10:56.346 --> 02:11:06.388]  And back when this happened, I told Dr. Grip and Anthony Gucciardi, I said, there's no way that I'm going to tell this story just because it's personal.
[02:11:07.478 --> 02:11:12.302]  It's private, and it's gross, but hey, let's all be adults here.
[02:11:12.382 --> 02:11:32.579]  If it's about ultimate health, if it's about really fighting the globalist agenda from all the GMO and all the artificial things that are in our food, the melamine plastic, the heavy metals, the toxins, the fluoride, the Grignard reagents, we need to tell the people.
[02:11:34.741 --> 02:11:40.865]  Now, Dr. Group develops many of the products that we have at Infowarslife.com.
[02:11:41.025 --> 02:11:44.107]  So part of this is, you know, an infomercial.
[02:11:44.167 --> 02:11:45.468]  And I do this a couple times a month.
[02:11:45.728 --> 02:11:46.909]  That's how we fund our operation.
[02:11:47.489 --> 02:11:49.911]  But in the mainstay, this is not an infomercial.
[02:11:50.531 --> 02:11:58.056]  90% of this is pure informational and are things you can do without us that will have a dramatic effect.
[02:12:00.307 --> 02:12:00.928]  A big effect.
[02:12:01.808 --> 02:12:04.670]  Everyone knows that the liver is toxic.
[02:12:04.730 --> 02:12:09.334]  People are getting liver cancer and having liver failure and problems all the time and never had a drink in their life.
[02:12:09.654 --> 02:12:11.836]  They don't have liver problems in their family history.
[02:12:12.176 --> 02:12:15.919]  It's the body's filter, along with the gallbladder and the kidneys.
[02:12:16.179 --> 02:12:16.900]  But it's the key one.
[02:12:18.441 --> 02:12:24.146]  One of the biggest organs inside of your stomach, inside of your chest area, inside of your abdomen and torso.
[02:12:26.427 --> 02:12:28.169]  And when you eat all these toxins,
[02:12:29.537 --> 02:12:41.824]  If you ate McDonald's nuggets 20 years ago that had plasticizers in them, your gallbladder and your liver doesn't know what to do, so the liver basically excretes that into the gallbladder, and it holds it.
[02:12:43.004 --> 02:12:45.326]  And if you're a TV viewer, I'm going to put this on screen.
[02:12:46.987 --> 02:12:52.069]  Just Google gallbladder stones, and it's disgusting, but you need to look at it.
[02:12:53.630 --> 02:12:58.213]  And when you finally get filled up with these, it bursts, or it gets infected, and they've got to remove it.
[02:12:59.753 --> 02:13:00.753]  And we'll scroll through these.
[02:13:00.773 --> 02:13:01.754]  There's even grosser ones.
[02:13:02.294 --> 02:13:03.154]  Like, let's scroll down.
[02:13:03.554 --> 02:13:05.235]  On average, they're green or black.
[02:13:05.635 --> 02:13:07.756]  If they're black, they're really old and toxic.
[02:13:09.857 --> 02:13:10.977]  They're generally green.
[02:13:12.197 --> 02:13:18.220]  And this stuff's meant to be passed out at you, but we eat such artificial food that it doesn't.
[02:13:18.380 --> 02:13:20.660]  These are way beyond kidney stones, you name it.
[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:22.061]  You also have liver stones.
[02:13:24.804 --> 02:13:28.446]  And medical doctors won't tell you on average, hey, flush your liver.
[02:13:29.007 --> 02:13:30.448]  They'll just say, hey, your liver's sick.
[02:13:30.988 --> 02:13:32.269]  It's going to get progressively worse.
[02:13:32.289 --> 02:13:34.350]  We're going to get you on a list for a liver transplant.
[02:13:37.472 --> 02:13:38.413]  It is unbelievable.
[02:13:38.433 --> 02:13:40.094]  We're showing these disgusting images.
[02:13:40.114 --> 02:13:46.698]  So, about a year and a half ago, Anthony Gucciardi just said, man, I just did a Dr. Gribbs liver cleanse, the one he recommends.
[02:13:47.899 --> 02:13:51.361]  And he's developing this proprietary stuff he's testing on himself right now.
[02:13:51.681 --> 02:13:52.422]  You really got to do it.
[02:13:54.181 --> 02:13:56.083]  The results are dramatic after six days.
[02:13:56.623 --> 02:13:58.365]  I'm like, no way, no way I'm doing it.
[02:13:58.886 --> 02:14:02.049]  I don't believe that there's giant black or green balls in my gallbladder.
[02:14:02.189 --> 02:14:03.110]  This is how ignorant I am.
[02:14:04.971 --> 02:14:06.173]  And he's like, look at it online.
[02:14:06.213 --> 02:14:07.354]  I'm not looking at it online.
[02:14:07.374 --> 02:14:08.355]  Stuff like that grosses me out.
[02:14:08.375 --> 02:14:08.995]  I don't want to go there.
[02:14:11.137 --> 02:14:13.820]  Well, finally about six months ago they convinced me to do it.
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:15.301]  So, the regimen
[02:14:16.334 --> 02:14:18.194]  is for six days and I don't sell this.
[02:14:18.534 --> 02:14:24.595]  The best is Bragg certified 100 years organic raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar.
[02:14:25.075 --> 02:14:26.676]  It's got the mother in it as they call it.
[02:14:27.016 --> 02:14:29.516]  Unpasteurized, naturally gluten-free.
[02:14:29.796 --> 02:14:31.357]  It's one of the best probiotics out there.
[02:14:31.597 --> 02:14:32.377]  We do not sell this.
[02:14:32.957 --> 02:14:44.199]  You take this four times a day in water, couple teaspoons or tablespoons, and you take the oxy powder four to seven tablets at night depending whatever you need.
[02:14:44.219 --> 02:14:45.299]  I just started it last night.
[02:14:46.308 --> 02:14:48.930]  And after you've done this a few times, it doesn't take three or four days to flush you out.
[02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:50.291]  It starts right away for me.
[02:14:50.331 --> 02:14:51.812]  This morning, it was there.
[02:14:53.573 --> 02:14:54.834]  Took four tablets last night.
[02:14:54.974 --> 02:14:58.076]  Took my first apple cider vinegar.
[02:14:59.217 --> 02:15:00.798]  I'll do that for six days.
[02:15:02.139 --> 02:15:09.604]  On Saturday evening, I will drink about seven ounces of organic olive oil before bedtime.
[02:15:09.945 --> 02:15:13.107]  I'll lay on my right side that has the gallbladder and the liver.
[02:15:14.742 --> 02:15:17.566]  And healthy people, it happens the next morning.
[02:15:17.586 --> 02:15:19.488]  I obviously wasn't healthy.
[02:15:19.548 --> 02:15:20.369]  It took two days.
[02:15:20.389 --> 02:15:21.490]  I said, see, it didn't happen.
[02:15:22.111 --> 02:15:31.463]  Well, two days later, ladies and gentlemen, I'm talking a toilet full of black and green gallbladder and liver stones.
[02:15:32.628 --> 02:15:34.469]  And Anthony goes, you've got to do it again and videotape it.
[02:15:34.790 --> 02:15:36.111]  I said, I said, no way.
[02:15:36.151 --> 02:15:37.372]  Well, actually Buckley was saying that.
[02:15:37.532 --> 02:15:43.677]  Because yeah, it will sell a lot of oxy powder and we've come out with a proprietary thing that he's developed the last two years.
[02:15:44.377 --> 02:15:46.319]  The new product we're launching today, Liver Shield.
[02:15:47.079 --> 02:15:48.180]  And you know, I just said, so what?
[02:15:48.220 --> 02:15:49.721]  I'm all about being real and transparent.
[02:15:49.961 --> 02:15:50.702]  We'll talk about it.
[02:15:53.180 --> 02:15:56.281]  Now about three or four percent of people, it doesn't happen the first time.
[02:15:56.321 --> 02:16:03.584]  Your gallbladder is so compacted, so full, so jammed full of stones that it doesn't even happen and it takes several cleanses to do it.
[02:16:04.724 --> 02:16:07.225]  And understand, talk to your physician first because
[02:16:08.407 --> 02:16:15.512]  You know, I haven't heard of this, but you know, if it's already totally full, trying to push all that out the first time might have some bad effect.
[02:16:15.552 --> 02:16:20.036]  I mean, you know, if your liver and your gallbladder are already totally screwed up, who knows what this will do?
[02:16:20.576 --> 02:16:24.899]  All I know is the amount of energy I got after this was dramatic.
[02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:30.962]  I mean within a day it was incredible and my skin got healthier and my energy went up even more.
[02:16:31.322 --> 02:16:38.284]  Basically I've slowly followed everything Dr. Group has said and now I'm following almost everything he says and it's life-changing.
[02:16:39.444 --> 02:16:41.345]  So today we're launching Liver Shield.
[02:16:41.365 --> 02:16:42.945]  He's here to talk about what's in it.
[02:16:43.445 --> 02:16:47.907]  You take four or five squirts of this two or three times a day in with the
[02:16:49.597 --> 02:16:51.038]  Apple Cider Organic Vinegar.
[02:16:51.919 --> 02:16:58.925]  You take your Oxy Powder at night, and it is totally, absolutely dramatic.
[02:16:59.006 --> 02:17:02.389]  Both of these are available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:17:03.490 --> 02:17:13.458]  Liver Shield exclusively, and I'm so honored that as he developed his own liver cleanse a few years ago that he started pushing this on me before he even allowed us to come out with it.
[02:17:14.326 --> 02:17:20.248]  So I was trying this six months ago, obviously before I rolled it out, and I finally did it because they said, look, it's real, do it.
[02:17:20.588 --> 02:17:22.349]  We want to offer you this as it rolls out.
[02:17:23.790 --> 02:17:26.511]  It's dramatic and you just got to try it for yourself.
[02:17:28.771 --> 02:17:31.673]  If you just, it's like changing fuel filters or oil filters.
[02:17:31.693 --> 02:17:35.394]  If you just let all that garbage pass out of you, if you just try it,
[02:17:37.242 --> 02:17:38.543]  It is a life-changing event.
[02:17:38.704 --> 02:17:52.077]  Infowarslife.com to get the liver shield that is key to have the full release happen, and oxy powder, and then of course, what they recommend is apple cider vinegar Bragg.
[02:17:52.157 --> 02:17:53.278]  B-R-A-G-G.
[02:17:54.039 --> 02:17:55.240]  Over a hundred years out there.
[02:17:56.101 --> 02:17:59.823]  Put out by an NDPHD with his wife, NDPHD.
[02:18:00.523 --> 02:18:06.306]  Pioneer health crusader, health educator, authors, original health stores, life extension supplement.
[02:18:06.666 --> 02:18:09.627]  Again, we don't sell this and get it at any good health store.
[02:18:10.007 --> 02:18:11.048]  It all goes together.
[02:18:11.448 --> 02:18:17.351]  And joining us to break down how this super cleanse works is Dr. Group.
[02:18:17.391 --> 02:18:21.953]  Now you can take liver shield every day and have an effect.
[02:18:23.433 --> 02:18:25.814]  And some may start getting released after a few weeks.
[02:18:26.354 --> 02:18:27.214]  A few here, a few there.
[02:18:27.254 --> 02:18:33.996]  But if you want to vomit all this up, it just doesn't come out the top, it comes out the bottom, it's dramatic.
[02:18:34.016 --> 02:18:37.937]  I mean, when you realize this was in you, folks, it is insane.
[02:18:38.857 --> 02:18:42.018]  It is insane, what we do to ourselves, and that nobody talks about this.
[02:18:42.338 --> 02:18:50.460]  Dr. Group, we're going to break here in a few minutes, but I'm talking about this personal experience, and I remember telling Anthony and you on the phone, I'm like, you know, I'm days into this,
[02:18:51.691 --> 02:18:55.655]  After it didn't happen, you're like, oh man, that shows you're really backed up.
[02:18:55.755 --> 02:19:01.801]  And then, I was going to the movies, I had to run out, and it was super dramatic.
[02:19:03.102 --> 02:19:08.347]  And exactly what you said, and I'm told it's worse if they were black and not green.
[02:19:08.388 --> 02:19:10.650]  I hate to talk about this, but what does this mean, Dr. Group?
[02:19:12.113 --> 02:19:21.876]  Well, first of all, you know, I was kind of skeptical myself about the best way to cleanse the liver, but it didn't take too long to realize when I started looking at the root cause of all disease.
[02:19:22.556 --> 02:19:29.559]  And then, obviously, we've talked about it many times, the toxins that people consume from the air, the food, the water, and everything that come into the body.
[02:19:30.279 --> 02:19:42.325]  There were two things that I found that the medical profession never wanted you to find out about and didn't teach a lot in medical school, and those were the actual organs in the body that regenerate themselves.
[02:19:42.365 --> 02:19:48.128]  The liver is the only organ that regenerates itself completely in three months.
[02:19:48.749 --> 02:19:54.432]  The intestines don't fully regenerate themselves, but the intestinal lining does.
[02:19:54.492 --> 02:19:57.553]  It's made of epithelial cells, and that regenerates itself every 24 hours.
[02:19:58.894 --> 02:20:01.777]  Well, then you look at all the disease-causing toxins.
[02:20:01.857 --> 02:20:04.480]  Well, where do the disease-causing toxins go?
[02:20:04.561 --> 02:20:08.465]  They come in through the intestines, and they get processed through the liver.
[02:20:09.006 --> 02:20:16.594]  So our philosophy and our research led us to, if we keep the intestines clean, and if we can cleanse the liver,
[02:20:17.415 --> 02:20:24.081]  Well, that should be, then the liver could process the toxins and eliminate the toxins, and the intestinal tract could eliminate the toxins.
[02:20:24.101 --> 02:20:26.603]  Sure, but I mean, what do the different colors of the gallstones mean?
[02:20:26.623 --> 02:20:30.025]  And I guess a normal gallbladder, I was reading, isn't supposed to be loaded with these.
[02:20:31.026 --> 02:20:42.355]  Well, what we found out over the years is that the majority, over 90% of the population, has an accumulation of liver stones and gallstones, and those can be a combination of just toxins.
[02:20:42.395 --> 02:20:43.456]  Well, mine were little and black.
[02:20:43.496 --> 02:20:44.117]  What does that mean?
[02:20:45.114 --> 02:21:00.361]  Well usually the black ones have been there for a long period of time and they attract different types of metals and other types of chemicals, you know, estrogens especially, which damage the liver cells and also the used up bile that is normally green but can turn black over a period of time.
[02:21:00.941 --> 02:21:09.685]  They're not technically, there are some stones that contain calcium but they're more like cholesterol globules that build up in there.
[02:21:09.846 --> 02:21:12.607]  So it's not good that I was loaded with black stones?
[02:21:13.931 --> 02:21:22.617]  No, because what happens is the liver performs like 500 different functions in the body, and that means it is the filtration system in the system.
[02:21:22.978 --> 02:21:31.644]  It helps fight off infection, it protects your immune system, neutralizes toxins, manufactures proteins, hormones, it helps control blood sugar.
[02:21:31.684 --> 02:21:39.069]  So when the liver is fatty and toxic, which most people have a fatty and toxic liver, and most people don't know how easy it is,
[02:21:39.970 --> 02:21:54.554]  Every single disease and symptom that people are associated with out there that the medical profession is diagnosing is associated or doesn't start until your liver becomes fatty or cirrhotic or your liver becomes malfunctioning.
[02:21:54.915 --> 02:22:01.176]  And with our research, we found that probably people only have 20% of their liver functioning on a daily basis.
[02:22:01.997 --> 02:22:05.498]  And that's what reactivates your body's own self-healing mechanism.
[02:22:06.403 --> 02:22:14.719]  Why did I get so much more energy when, because I'd already gotten a lot following your directives, but once this happened, it was dramatic.
[02:22:16.499 --> 02:22:21.522]  Well, the liver filters about one and a half quarts of blood every minute.
[02:22:22.202 --> 02:22:29.206]  So think about if you had an oil filter in your car that was full of gunk and it was fatty and the oil couldn't press itself through there anymore.
[02:22:29.726 --> 02:22:32.988]  Ultimately, it would lead to disease and it would lead to malfunction.
[02:22:33.008 --> 02:22:33.889]  The engine starts sputtering.
[02:22:33.929 --> 02:22:34.749]  Oh, I forgot the other part.
[02:22:34.789 --> 02:22:36.930]  I'm not a heavy drinker, but I do drink occasionally.
[02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:39.652]  I have a few drinks, a few glasses of wine.
[02:22:39.672 --> 02:22:40.292]  I made Italian food.
[02:22:41.553 --> 02:22:45.155]  After I did the cleanse, alcohol had a much bigger effect on me.
[02:22:46.476 --> 02:23:01.788]  Well that's because your liver is starting to actually function again and repair itself and that's the good news that I personally think everybody should go through a liver cleansing if you haven't done one and then take the, for example, the liver shield can be taken two different ways.
[02:23:01.848 --> 02:23:03.989]  It can be taken as a liver support formula.
[02:23:04.773 --> 02:23:10.801]  Well, you just take a couple dropper fulls, but that's not going to purge the liver and remove all that stuff from it.
[02:23:11.222 --> 02:23:19.874]  In order to do that, you have to do the six-day... Well, I'm going to walk through how the liver works, the different types of cleanses with you, and give you the floor, but I'm asking a lot of selfish questions here up front.
[02:23:21.716 --> 02:23:36.469]  How does the apple cider vinegar organic with the oxy powder and with the liver trucks over a six-day cleanse, how does it then when you take the olive oil at the end, lay on your side for an hour as you go to sleep, why does it then have the gallbladder release?
[02:23:38.103 --> 02:23:44.545]  Well, this is something that is a very controversial issue, but results speak for themselves.
[02:23:44.605 --> 02:23:52.027]  I mean, hundreds of thousands of people have done this, and it dates back even a thousand years, drinking oils to cleanse and purge the liver.
[02:23:52.507 --> 02:23:57.709]  Actually, the Greeks over in India with Ayurvedic medicine have done it the same way.
[02:23:57.769 --> 02:24:03.931]  But how it works is, what you should do, and this is what our proprietary research led us to do back
[02:24:04.651 --> 02:24:18.983]  Starting in the early 90s when we were looking at the best ways to cleanse the liver was to develop an herbal formula that contains herbs that will help soften or break down these globules or these stones in the liver and the gallbladder.
[02:24:19.303 --> 02:24:21.805]  And that's really what the first five days is for.
[02:24:22.285 --> 02:24:24.587]  That's where you mix the bottle of liver shield.
[02:24:24.607 --> 02:24:31.313]  You pour the whole bottle in a gallon of distilled water and then you drink four eight ounce glasses a day of that.
[02:24:31.733 --> 02:24:32.734]  Four or five days.
[02:24:32.894 --> 02:24:36.376]  At the same time, though, you're also using the apple cider vinegar.
[02:24:36.396 --> 02:24:44.180]  And the full instructions will be up on your site probably by the time that we get done talking about it because we were making some modifications before I came on.
[02:24:45.261 --> 02:24:53.006]  So I recommend, and that's going to be the liver flush kit that you guys will be, that we put together exclusively for InfoWars.
[02:24:53.826 --> 02:24:58.650]  You know, viewers and the people that want to support the, you know, the InfoWar.
[02:24:59.150 --> 02:25:03.434]  So basically that, once you do that for five days, and of course you want to eat fairly healthy.
[02:25:03.454 --> 02:25:06.276]  You don't want to be putting a bunch of chemicals and toxins into your body.
[02:25:06.696 --> 02:25:10.979]  But then on day five is when you actually do the olive oil.
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:18.706]  And when you do Epsom salts and the Epsom salts that you drink will actually help relax the bile duct.
[02:25:19.666 --> 02:25:27.491]  And make it a lot more elastic so any of the stones can pass through there, or the globules, the toxic globules.
[02:25:28.111 --> 02:25:34.195]  And then, when you lay on your, you drink the olive oil, you lay on your right side, because your liver is on the right side.
[02:25:34.935 --> 02:25:40.996]  And that heavy oil ends up absorbing down through your intestinal lining and going into the liver.
[02:25:41.016 --> 02:25:44.597]  And it kind of works like oil pulling, which is a big thing now.
[02:25:44.617 --> 02:25:49.058]  It was on Dr. Ross with the coconut oil, where you swish it in your mouth.
[02:25:49.138 --> 02:25:53.239]  And oil has an affinity for toxic substances and absorbs some of those.
[02:25:53.879 --> 02:25:59.840]  And when you do the liver cleanse, you will actually form also little oil globulins as well.
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:21.052]  So the reason why you take during the flush, the liver flush, the reason why you take oxy powder at the same time is because you want to be able to flush that out of the system because when the liver dumps all those toxic balls and rocks and all that toxic buildup that's been in there for years and years and years, you want to have something to flush it out of the intestines.
[02:26:21.472 --> 02:26:27.336]  Years ago they used to always use colonics or enemas whenever they did liver cleansing or liver flushing but
[02:26:27.876 --> 02:26:32.708]  Now since we developed proprietary process of using the oxy powder with the oxygen...
[02:26:33.789 --> 02:26:35.530]  It's an easier way to do that.
[02:26:36.150 --> 02:26:43.014]  And it's amazing, once your liver becomes clean, the kind of things that you will see with the increased energy.
[02:26:44.094 --> 02:26:57.721]  And not only that, but you're focusing on the main organ system in your body that has a direct influence with how your body deals with symptoms and prevents disease, which is the liver.
[02:26:57.761 --> 02:27:02.043]  Because if you, every single thing that causes disease out there,
[02:27:03.150 --> 02:27:04.705]  Ultimately goes through your liver.
[02:27:05.712 --> 02:27:09.535]  Actually, your emotions have a lot to do with toxic liver as well.
[02:27:09.795 --> 02:27:12.657]  Anger, fear, depression, anxiety.
[02:27:12.677 --> 02:27:14.598]  By the way, you were saying this 10 years ago.
[02:27:14.658 --> 02:27:18.281]  Now mainstream news and science is going, yeah, the gut does affect mood.
[02:27:18.321 --> 02:27:27.387]  And wow, because our guts are dead because of all the herbicides and don't have the right bacteria, we're not creating the right amounts of melatonin and all sorts of other things.
[02:27:27.447 --> 02:27:28.507]  I mean, it's really simple.
[02:27:28.567 --> 02:27:30.889]  And so much of autism is connected to it.
[02:27:31.269 --> 02:27:33.130]  And the power structure knows all this.
[02:27:34.111 --> 02:27:37.172]  It's why they went after Dr. Wakefield and others.
[02:27:37.712 --> 02:27:41.713]  And now it turns out that all his science was real and fact-based and they've exonerated his partner.
[02:27:42.534 --> 02:27:44.414]  So they're really trying to cover all this up.
[02:27:45.615 --> 02:27:46.535]  It's just crazy.
[02:27:47.015 --> 02:27:50.216]  Do we know, on average, what a healthy gallbladder would have?
[02:27:51.036 --> 02:27:52.277]  Would it have any stones?
[02:27:52.297 --> 02:27:56.418]  Because the media tells us, or at least in the old days, you don't need a gallbladder.
[02:27:56.818 --> 02:27:58.178]  I mean, pure bull.
[02:27:58.198 --> 02:28:02.720]  Tell folks what the gallbladder does and how it connects to the liver and how it gets dumped out in the gut.
[02:28:03.180 --> 02:28:04.080]  Or the intestines?
[02:28:04.100 --> 02:28:09.103]  Well, I mean, basically the gallbladder just stores bile from the liver to help break down your fats.
[02:28:09.603 --> 02:28:13.905]  But that's an interesting subject because people have problems with weight gain.
[02:28:14.165 --> 02:28:20.608]  All the weight gain is associated with fatty liver because the liver is what really breaks down the fats.
[02:28:20.648 --> 02:28:29.593]  And with the high carbohydrate diet that everybody's on, you know, the pastas, all the pasta, the bread, the sugar, the high fructose corn syrup,
[02:28:30.453 --> 02:28:38.537]  All of that stuff converts to high levels of glucose in the liver, and it clogs the liver up, and that causes obesity.
[02:28:38.817 --> 02:28:50.882]  When I wrote a book and started looking for the real cause of obesity and the real cause of weight gain, yes, iodine deficiency was one of those, but it really all starts in the liver because the liver can't break down the fats properly.
[02:28:50.902 --> 02:28:57.165]  Well, that's what my dad always says, and he's a lot skinner than I am, and he was trying to get me to lose weight a few years ago, is he said, listen, drinking
[02:28:58.513 --> 02:29:03.701]  Toxifies your liver, it processes the fat, and then it just pushes it all through and makes you gain weight.
[02:29:04.402 --> 02:29:08.188]  That's why you don't want to drink, because it then fries your liver.
[02:29:08.910 --> 02:29:10.051]  And then, it's true!
[02:29:11.787 --> 02:29:12.027]  It is.
[02:29:12.508 --> 02:29:19.433]  When I was writing a book called The 10 Super Secrets to Weight Loss, liver cleansing was the number one thing to do.
[02:29:19.493 --> 02:29:25.257]  And once people did usually about three liver cleanses, at first I used to think one liver cleanse was enough.
[02:29:25.717 --> 02:29:30.840]  And we've had probably 50, probably hundreds of thousands of people that have gone through liver cleanses.
[02:29:31.261 --> 02:29:39.547]  And the reviews out there online, I mean, this is not something that I, I perfected it as far as making sure it's all done organically and changed it up a little bit.
[02:29:40.407 --> 02:29:48.334]  But even looking at the results of liver cleanses for every kind of illness dating back, the success rates are amazing.
[02:29:48.374 --> 02:29:50.936]  But again, you're addressing the root cause of the problem.
[02:29:50.956 --> 02:29:51.517]  They don't want to do that.
[02:29:51.537 --> 02:29:53.939]  They want to treat the symptoms and keep you sick forever.
[02:29:53.979 --> 02:29:58.643]  We'll be back to talk about how you do the cleanse, how often you should do the cleanse, versus maintenance.
[02:29:59.263 --> 02:30:00.144]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.644 --> 02:30:01.905]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.925 --> 02:30:03.146]  This is really important stuff, folks.
[02:30:03.206 --> 02:30:05.869]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.972 --> 02:30:12.495]  Let's talk about the real war on women.
[02:30:12.996 --> 02:30:15.459]  First wave feminism was a noble cause.
[02:30:15.839 --> 02:30:16.961]  But modern feminists?
[02:30:17.341 --> 02:30:17.481]  Ha!
[02:30:17.862 --> 02:30:25.792]  Well, instead of fighting for, say, paid and protected maternity leave, they want to ban words, shirts, and manspreading.
[02:30:26.232 --> 02:30:26.893]  Come on!
[02:30:27.233 --> 02:30:34.438]  That's cultural Marxism, which asserts that culture and language is responsible for oppressing women and not the state.
[02:30:34.758 --> 02:30:38.121]  The truth is, the state encourages gender wars.
[02:30:38.461 --> 02:30:42.464]  It's a divide-and-conquer tactic designed to keep us fighting amongst ourselves.
[02:30:42.844 --> 02:30:47.428]  In fact, the feminist movement was hijacked by the political class to exploit women.
[02:30:47.728 --> 02:30:51.731]  As the late Aaron Russo revealed, the Rockefellers bankrolled feminism
[02:30:52.211 --> 02:30:58.635]  Not because they had any interest in women's rights, but because women in the workforce was the ultimate trifecta.
[02:30:58.835 --> 02:31:06.020]  The state collects more tax dollars, children are indoctrinated at an earlier age, and the traditional family structure destroyed.
[02:31:06.380 --> 02:31:09.162]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com

[02:33:28.234 --> 02:33:29.695]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:29.935 --> 02:33:30.996]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:31.576 --> 02:33:36.138]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:36.278 --> 02:33:54.168]  I'm an axe grinder
[02:33:55.325 --> 02:33:57.288]  I don't know.
[02:34:06.463 --> 02:34:09.304]  So it's a totally unfair and unbalanced fight.
[02:34:09.804 --> 02:34:20.466]  And now the rebels are, the freedom fighters, the Syrian National Army, are being beaten every place around Syria.
[02:34:20.506 --> 02:34:23.807]  So we've got to change the battlefield situation.
[02:34:24.227 --> 02:34:28.288]  And just sending arms, very frankly, although they need them very badly.
[02:34:28.348 --> 02:34:30.408]  They need anti-tank and anti-air weapons.
[02:34:31.269 --> 02:34:35.393]  ...is not going to change the situation on the ground and the massacre goes on.
[02:34:35.693 --> 02:34:47.106]  ISIS, blatantly supported by John McCain and the Pentagon and hesitantly supplied tanks, rocket launchers, missile and anti-aircraft systems in accidental airdrops.
[02:34:47.506 --> 02:34:55.393]  According to volunteer forces who are fighting the terrorists, American helicopters drop boxes of weapons in Yathrib and Balad districts in the Salahuddin province.
[02:34:55.953 --> 02:35:01.978]  The airdrop comes as the Iraqi army and volunteers are making significant gains against the terrorist group there.
[02:35:02.038 --> 02:35:03.359]  Now, back in October, the U.S.
[02:35:03.379 --> 02:35:10.685]  military admitted that a bundle of ammunition and weapons it had dropped over the Syrian border town of Kobani had ended up in the hands of ISIL members.
[02:35:10.905 --> 02:35:18.067]  Now it has been confirmed that ISIS has stockpiled enough radioactive material to create weapons of mass destruction.
[02:35:18.447 --> 02:35:32.411]  In the ISIS magazine Dabiq, ISIS declared their intent to acquire a nuclear warhead from Pakistan with their billions of stolen funds, gobbled up as they ransacked banks and took control of oil fields across Iraq and Syria.
[02:35:32.711 --> 02:35:42.320]  ISIS claims that all they have to do is call on their leaders in Pakistan to purchase a nuclear device through weapons dealers with links to corrupt officials in the region.
[02:35:42.501 --> 02:35:45.744]  India's Defense Minister, Rao Inderjit Singh, made the remark,
[02:35:50.208 --> 02:35:55.153]  That perhaps they might get access to a nuclear arsenal from states like Pakistan.
[02:35:55.413 --> 02:35:56.975]  Bloomberg quoted him as saying,
[02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:33.252]  And it's designed to target mainly an American audience that is not geopolitically informed and doesn't know what's been happening for over two and a half years in Syria, where NATO and the United States, that includes France, England, you name it, have injected over a hundred thousand foreign fighters from Saudi Arabia, from
[02:36:34.573 --> 02:36:40.857]  Qatar, from so many other countries that are Al-Qaeda in over 60% of the cases.
[02:36:40.877 --> 02:36:41.518]  That's admitted.
[02:36:42.058 --> 02:36:45.000]  They are engaging in incredible atrocities across the nation.
[02:36:45.420 --> 02:36:50.263]  And three times in the last two years, they have been caught staging chemical attacks.
[02:36:50.943 --> 02:36:51.724]  They've been caught!
[02:36:52.164 --> 02:36:56.326]  Even mainstream news admits in the back of the paper, okay, they staged it.
[02:36:56.807 --> 02:37:03.471]  It's the type they use, they did it, to blame Assad and the Syrian military so they can take over.
[02:37:04.178 --> 02:37:08.880]  There is a reason why President Obama... There's a reason the White House signs our own book about brain-damaging us with it.
[02:37:08.900 --> 02:37:10.500]  ...to stop the proliferation of these weapons.
[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:13.921]  Because you're a bunch of murderous, psychopathic bastards!
[02:37:14.302 --> 02:37:18.863]  And I'm so sick of watching you commit crime after crime and running Al-Qaeda!
[02:37:18.963 --> 02:37:20.404]  John Kerry!
[02:37:20.464 --> 02:37:23.605]  Norm cannot be tolerated without consequences.
[02:37:23.625 --> 02:37:23.765]  Liar!
[02:37:23.865 --> 02:37:24.385]  Liar!
[02:37:24.845 --> 02:37:25.305]  Liar!
[02:37:25.345 --> 02:37:26.146]  And there is a reason.
[02:37:26.886 --> 02:37:41.798]  Why no matter what you believe about Syria... No matter what you believe... All peoples and all nations... All people who believe in the cause of our common humanity... Our humanity should support them injecting Al-Qaeda rebels to try to overthrow the government and kill all the Christians.
[02:37:42.418 --> 02:37:44.680]  ISIS is about 30,000.
[02:37:45.781 --> 02:37:46.381]  Irregular.
[02:37:46.681 --> 02:37:48.263]  They're not technically trained.
[02:37:49.782 --> 02:37:55.869]  To fight, they have only the heavy equipment that they capture from us.
[02:37:56.670 --> 02:38:08.105]  Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says NATO is deeply concerned about radioactive materials ISIS has seized from research centers and hospitals that are exclusive to government stockpiles.
[02:38:08.485 --> 02:38:21.753]  ISIS has already been pushing its way into Saudi Arabia, Yemen and other parts of the Middle East, becoming as UK Home Secretary Theresa May declared, just months away from becoming the world's first truly terrorist state.
[02:38:22.213 --> 02:38:27.716]  ISIS has essentially reached this plateau of potential mass devastation in roughly one year.
[02:38:27.956 --> 02:38:30.378]  They will not rest until their perfect storm
[02:38:30.778 --> 02:38:37.583]  Globalized militant groups have unleashed its full scope of US-backed intelligence and funding on the American public.
[02:38:37.823 --> 02:38:41.586]  Of course, whether they have weapons or not is beside the point.
[02:38:41.846 --> 02:38:56.416]  ISIS is already very successful at engaging the media in a giant psy-op to terrorize the public and keep a firm grip on American freedoms as deemed necessary by the elite corporatic succubus as they prepare the final phases of
[02:38:56.996 --> 02:39:06.060]  I thought it was important to air that special report.
[02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:15.643]  When that report went up yesterday on Infowars.com, after it had been on the nightly news, I saw a minority of people in the comments going, which is it?
[02:39:15.683 --> 02:39:17.604]  Does ISIS exist or not exist?
[02:39:18.104 --> 02:39:20.085]  People build intellectual straw men.
[02:39:21.434 --> 02:39:23.316]  Or, they're not smart enough to understand what I'm saying.
[02:39:23.836 --> 02:39:25.418]  This is Al-Qaeda 2.0.
[02:39:25.818 --> 02:39:32.804]  The original Al-Qaeda was synthetic, led by Western intelligence, Saudi Arabia, that's come out.
[02:39:33.285 --> 02:39:38.389]  Now it's a larger proxy army to take over areas, but it's not fully controlled by the globalists.
[02:39:38.750 --> 02:39:41.152]  They're just turning it loose, like in Libya and other areas.
[02:39:41.712 --> 02:39:45.656]  When it gets out of control and attacks areas they don't want attacked, they then bomb it.
[02:39:47.298 --> 02:39:51.864]  They then use the threat in Africa to invade the whole continent.
[02:39:52.325 --> 02:39:53.587]  Boko Haram crisis.
[02:39:53.667 --> 02:39:56.811]  US to fund Nigerian led force to counter Boko Haram.
[02:39:56.852 --> 02:39:59.215]  BBC, the same group funded by the West.
[02:39:59.275 --> 02:40:01.558]  Now, let me tell you about the special we're running.
[02:40:02.279 --> 02:40:03.201]  This liver shield
[02:40:05.322 --> 02:40:05.762]  Yes, we are.
[02:40:25.213 --> 02:40:28.674]  You're going to find anywhere, because Groot puts out the Oxy-Powder, he's the manufacturer of it.
[02:40:28.894 --> 02:40:31.175]  This is used in Hollywood for folks to lose dress sizes.
[02:40:31.795 --> 02:40:37.276]  High level oxygen, that means it's a higher level, it time releases in the intestines, and is dramatic.
[02:40:38.237 --> 02:40:54.341]  You add this with a six day cleanse, with the apple cider vinegar, and with a bottle of this over six days mixed with water, and you drink four different glasses of that a day, then on the sixth day when you're going to bed, you drink six, seven ounces of olive oil,
[02:40:55.635 --> 02:41:00.737]  Organic, cold-pressed, first-press olive oil.
[02:41:01.137 --> 02:41:04.158]  You lay on your right side for an hour until you go to sleep reading a book.
[02:41:04.638 --> 02:41:05.579]  You wake up in the morning.
[02:41:05.639 --> 02:41:07.419]  Most people have dramatic results the next morning.
[02:41:07.899 --> 02:41:08.199]  I didn't.
[02:41:08.219 --> 02:41:16.042]  It took a couple days until I was going to see a movie at the Alamo Draft House and had to get up and it was dramatic.
[02:41:16.502 --> 02:41:18.103]  And it was exactly what everybody said.
[02:41:18.123 --> 02:41:22.384]  It was exactly what you see online when you Google gallbladder stones.
[02:41:22.465 --> 02:41:23.205]  It's disgusting.
[02:41:24.008 --> 02:41:25.990]  And I've never talked about stuff like this on air.
[02:41:26.390 --> 02:41:27.271]  I didn't even believe it.
[02:41:27.751 --> 02:41:29.973]  I thought, like, kidney stones or something, you'd have a couple of them.
[02:41:30.093 --> 02:41:30.914]  It's disgusting.
[02:41:31.335 --> 02:41:33.036]  Dr. Gripp, I'm going to give you the floor now.
[02:41:34.357 --> 02:41:35.959]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:41:36.639 --> 02:41:37.420]  It's dramatic.
[02:41:38.100 --> 02:41:40.903]  Obviously, folks should probably talk to their health care provider before they do this.
[02:41:41.383 --> 02:41:47.309]  But this is one of the single biggest results, if not the biggest, I've ever seen in my life, literally in a six-day period.
[02:41:47.689 --> 02:41:49.190]  This is something anybody can do.
[02:41:50.111 --> 02:41:51.832]  Are there any downsides to it?
[02:41:52.132 --> 02:41:55.113]  If the gallbladder is ready to bust, could this trigger something?
[02:41:55.613 --> 02:41:56.934]  Let's talk about any downsides.
[02:41:56.974 --> 02:41:57.854]  Talk to your physician.
[02:41:58.294 --> 02:41:59.375]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:41:59.415 --> 02:42:00.435]  The bottle of liver shield is $29.95.
[02:42:00.475 --> 02:42:02.176]  It helps fund the operation.
[02:42:09.119 --> 02:42:15.305]  And then, of course, we have the Advanced Cleanse that goes with the Oxy Powder with a discount.
[02:42:15.565 --> 02:42:16.806]  So you get a discount on that, $76.90.
[02:42:18.167 --> 02:42:21.651]  And again, the profit we make from this helps fund this entire operation.
[02:42:21.691 --> 02:42:24.033]  So it's a 360 win, as I call it.
[02:42:24.473 --> 02:42:25.594]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:42:25.634 --> 02:42:26.775]  Folks, don't procrastinate.
[02:42:32.040 --> 02:42:41.287]  The mainline medical system is just going to tell you, oh, go on liver medication, or get ready to have a liver transplant, or whatever, or just... I mean, it's crazy.
[02:42:41.647 --> 02:42:50.793]  I have a family member who has, on a scale of 1 to 40 at some medical scale, has like a 14 with liver stuff.
[02:42:51.674 --> 02:42:56.057]  And no one's telling him, hey, you can quit drinking, you can...
[02:42:58.015 --> 02:43:05.221]  You know, your liver can grow back like an amphibian's tail or something, like a salamander's tail.
[02:43:06.042 --> 02:43:07.463]  No one's telling them any of this.
[02:43:07.823 --> 02:43:09.985]  They're just saying, we're getting you on a list for a transplant.
[02:43:10.225 --> 02:43:12.287]  We think within five to ten years, you'll need a new liver.
[02:43:12.907 --> 02:43:14.088]  No discussion of liver health.
[02:43:14.168 --> 02:43:17.331]  No discussion of what different prescription drugs can do to your liver.
[02:43:17.751 --> 02:43:19.073]  Just get ready to have a new liver.
[02:43:19.713 --> 02:43:22.836]  And then that has all those complications and serious problems.
[02:43:23.156 --> 02:43:26.499]  So all we're saying is obviously you want to flush your liver out.
[02:43:27.060 --> 02:43:30.082]  Obviously the literature is well known on what liver cleanses do.
[02:43:30.423 --> 02:43:32.304]  This is the best one out there from our research.
[02:43:32.705 --> 02:43:34.566]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:43:38.243 --> 02:43:40.104]  And I wasn't going to share my personal details.
[02:43:40.124 --> 02:43:45.226]  I was just going to talk about what other people had and talk about reviews and talk about what happened with Group and others.
[02:43:45.286 --> 02:43:50.188]  But I thought it was important enough for you and your family to be honest with you and to be literally transparent.
[02:43:50.588 --> 02:43:57.451]  So, liver shield with the oxy powder and with an organic form of apple cider vinegar.
[02:43:57.951 --> 02:44:02.733]  Tell us, Dr. Group, what the three things do together, how you do it again, what's happening in the liver.
[02:44:03.193 --> 02:44:07.615]  You've got the floor for the next 16 minutes until the transmission ends, Dr. Group.
[02:44:08.720 --> 02:44:09.966]  Okay, well, I mean...
[02:44:11.192 --> 02:44:20.340]  The fact of the matter is, with the environment that we live in, everybody needs to be doing liver cleansing, and it's all about addressing the root cause of the problem.
[02:44:20.960 --> 02:44:37.774]  The medical profession is never going to tell you that your liver is congested, and your liver is toxic, and your liver is fatty, and your liver is cirrhotic, which is just scar tissue built up in there, because there's 900, over 900 prescription medications that injure the liver, and 80% of all
[02:44:39.395 --> 02:44:48.421]  Cases of liver toxicity are actually caused by drug reactions, and there's children that have even died from taking in acetaminophen and everything else like that.
[02:44:49.682 --> 02:44:56.947]  Right now, they're not telling the general public how big of a problem liver damage actually is.
[02:44:57.208 --> 02:45:01.471]  There's children right now that have liver damage and fatty liver.
[02:45:02.351 --> 02:45:08.536]  There's an actual diagnosis called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
[02:45:09.096 --> 02:45:18.091]  Which is affecting many Americans and it's a leading cause of cirrhosis in adults and it even affects one out of every four Americans right now.
[02:45:18.652 --> 02:45:21.317]  And that's from people that don't even drink alcohol.
[02:45:21.377 --> 02:45:22.339]  So if you add
[02:45:23.664 --> 02:45:35.208]  Over two drinks a day for men and one drink a day for women, that actually increases the chances of you having fatty liver disease or developing cirrhosis.
[02:45:35.608 --> 02:45:47.713]  And with the liver, with our research, and this is why it's so hard for the medical profession to diagnose anything in the intestines and in the liver, because there's really no tests that you can do.
[02:45:47.733 --> 02:45:50.114]  I mean, yes, there's liver enzyme tests that can
[02:45:50.905 --> 02:46:01.974]  When they get high, but when they do get high, usually it's too late and there's not a lot of tests that you can do to determine how many toxins are in the liver, how many toxins are in the intestines.
[02:46:02.715 --> 02:46:06.678]  So it's really simple when you think about any type of disease mechanism and
[02:46:08.719 --> 02:46:27.078]  The fact that the body has the ability to heal any disease known to man, any symptom, is that once you clean the liver, once you clean the intestines, once you clean the parasites, once you clean all the chemicals and heavy metals out of the body, once you stop putting all those chemicals in the system, then ultimately the body heals itself.
[02:46:27.990 --> 02:46:55.724]  Now, the liver also stores the majority of the nutrients that we need and that's why people are, even though they're eating and they're taking vitamins all the time and they're taking vitamins that contain synthetic fillers and excipients like maltodextrin and silicon dioxide and titanium dioxide and those type of chemicals, those are actual fats, fatty substances that get stored in the liver as well.
[02:46:56.244 --> 02:47:11.550]  So, what we found, like I was saying earlier, is if you're walking around with your liver only functioning at 10, 15, 20 percent, then you need to get the liver up to about 75 percent to really start feeling the new energy.
[02:47:11.590 --> 02:47:22.654]  And that's why you see kids that have horrible diets and everything, their liver's not completely congested yet, so it's able to break down the fats, it's able to take care of certain things.
[02:47:23.374 --> 02:47:23.454]  Yes.
[02:47:42.230 --> 02:48:03.081]  Which are also, you know, the phthalates and the BPA and the xenoestrogens that are found in the water supply and in the food supply can actually alter the gene expression in the liver and the liver function, increasing the susceptibility to liver failure, cirrhosis, and obesity and metabolic diseases, even in children.
[02:48:03.161 --> 02:48:08.404]  So really, the whole purpose of cleansing the liver is tracing back what we need to do
[02:48:09.625 --> 02:48:20.429]  To address the root cause of the problem, and the best way to do it is with liver-supporting herbs, purging the liver and flushing the liver of all the things that have been inside of it.
[02:48:21.009 --> 02:48:26.951]  I've, you know, I even read a story about a guy that had four-stage cancer, and I'm not, you know, making any claims here.
[02:48:26.991 --> 02:48:28.072]  This was a story online.
[02:48:28.092 --> 02:48:36.015]  I don't know if it's true or not, but I've talked to doctors that have used liver cleansing and read thousands upon thousands of reviews.
[02:48:36.915 --> 02:48:41.396]  That this guy did 26 back-to-back liver and gallbladder cleanses.
[02:48:41.916 --> 02:48:45.137]  He was sent home to die with only two weeks left to live with cancer.
[02:48:45.677 --> 02:48:53.399]  And apparently, after the 26th liver and gallbladder cleanse, he went back into his physician and his cancer was completely gone.
[02:48:53.959 --> 02:49:00.681]  Now, you know, I've read every condition that you can possibly read, and it's all about one thing.
[02:49:00.981 --> 02:49:02.361]  When the body is clean,
[02:49:03.683 --> 02:49:14.673]  And you're putting clean food and clean water and you're breathing clean air, which you can create for yourself in your home environment, your office environment, that disease can actually cease to exist.
[02:49:14.773 --> 02:49:15.233]  Well, sure.
[02:49:15.253 --> 02:49:16.554]  I mean, I mean, here's an example.
[02:49:17.095 --> 02:49:18.936]  There's a gas station where I used to live.
[02:49:18.956 --> 02:49:20.438]  That's a nice place.
[02:49:20.478 --> 02:49:21.739]  They sell barbecue as well.
[02:49:21.759 --> 02:49:23.721]  But they're down a hill.
[02:49:25.054 --> 02:49:28.637]  And I got gas there a few times and my car would have problems.
[02:49:29.338 --> 02:49:30.539]  Then I was talking to Weldon.
[02:49:30.979 --> 02:49:34.482]  He goes, oh, you didn't know they get water in the gas there because they're down that hill.
[02:49:35.002 --> 02:49:36.684]  Everybody knows don't get your gas there.
[02:49:37.654 --> 02:49:41.498]  So instead of them stopping selling gas or fixing it, they just keep selling it.
[02:49:42.179 --> 02:49:42.899]  But it's simple.
[02:49:42.959 --> 02:49:48.125]  You get a cup of water in 10 gallons of gas, your car's gonna sputter till it conks out.
[02:49:48.605 --> 02:49:49.266]  It's real simple.
[02:49:49.286 --> 02:49:56.253]  If your liver, the main filter, is filled with all these different stones and all this garbage, I mean, no wonder it can't operate.
[02:49:57.520 --> 02:50:06.907]  But another thing that we talked about a little bit was the high fructose corn syrup and that's extremely, that's like poison to your liver, almost as bad as alcohol is.
[02:50:07.707 --> 02:50:17.134]  And studies show that Americans consume about 12% of their total calories on average from high fructose corn syrup.
[02:50:17.154 --> 02:50:18.395]  Why is high fructose so bad?
[02:50:19.909 --> 02:50:22.051]  Well, high fructose corn syrup is man-made.
[02:50:22.091 --> 02:50:26.396]  That's why it's so bad, because most of it's made from genetically modified corn.
[02:50:26.456 --> 02:50:28.519]  It's got levels of mercury inside of it.
[02:50:28.959 --> 02:50:31.542]  They use processing chemicals to create it.
[02:50:32.443 --> 02:50:33.985]  And it's a toxin.
[02:50:34.025 --> 02:50:35.226]  It's a poison to the body.
[02:50:35.246 --> 02:50:38.050]  So when it comes in the body, it's not a natural food.
[02:50:38.650 --> 02:50:42.371]  It's synthetic, so when it comes in, the body has a hard time breaking it down.
[02:50:42.391 --> 02:50:44.952]  The liver has to work extra hard to break it down.
[02:50:45.572 --> 02:50:47.033]  It can kill liver cells.
[02:50:47.093 --> 02:50:48.053]  It's so damaging.
[02:50:48.533 --> 02:50:54.415]  And because the liver has to break the fructose up and break all the other chemicals.
[02:50:54.515 --> 02:50:55.075]  Incredible.
[02:50:55.395 --> 02:50:57.296]  Well, Dr. Ripp, stay there.
[02:50:57.336 --> 02:50:58.016]  Final segment.
[02:50:58.336 --> 02:51:00.417]  In the fight for human liberty, we need to be healthy.
[02:51:00.817 --> 02:51:05.178]  Purified water, clean, sunshine, non-GMO, and have a clean liver.

[02:51:10.080 --> 02:51:11.181]  Honey, it's time for dinner.
[02:51:11.882 --> 02:51:13.303]  What are you doing over there on your computer?
[02:51:13.743 --> 02:51:15.024]  I'm shopping for a new wallet.
[02:51:15.244 --> 02:51:16.365]  Mine has fallen apart.
[02:51:16.786 --> 02:51:22.570]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[02:51:22.951 --> 02:51:25.753]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing.
[02:51:26.173 --> 02:51:26.694]  What is that?
[02:51:27.014 --> 02:51:36.122]  Well, apparently, many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID to transmit our banking information to card readers when we pay.
[02:51:36.542 --> 02:51:44.949]  Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it.
[02:51:45.270 --> 02:51:45.590]  Wow!
[02:51:45.890 --> 02:51:46.831]  That sounds scary.
[02:51:47.211 --> 02:51:51.575]  Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should definitely get an ID Stronghold Shielded Wallet.
[02:51:51.675 --> 02:51:52.496]  Are they more expensive?
[02:51:52.916 --> 02:51:53.156]  No.
[02:51:53.437 --> 02:52:00.702]  In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from IDStronghold.com for the same price or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[02:52:01.123 --> 02:52:01.963]  Sounds great!
[02:52:02.303 --> 02:52:04.926]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too.
[02:52:04.946 --> 02:52:09.009]  I want to be protected and these wallets at IDStronghold.com look fantastic!

[02:53:14.440 --> 02:53:15.621]  I was frustrated.
[02:53:15.701 --> 02:53:18.242]  Yuvia found On Deck Business Loans.
[02:53:18.622 --> 02:53:19.742]  On Deck did it for me.
[02:53:19.983 --> 02:53:25.185]  I called on Saturday and I had $50,000 in my account on Monday morning.

[02:53:52.241 --> 02:53:54.042]  Truly, truly, the sky is the limit.
[02:53:54.302 --> 02:53:55.003]  I'm excited.
[02:53:55.603 --> 02:53:58.744]  Apply now at OnDeckLending.com or call 800-326-5430.
[02:53:58.764 --> 02:53:58.824]  800-326-5430.
[02:53:58.844 --> 02:53:58.924]  800-326-5430.
[02:53:58.944 --> 02:53:59.904]  Loan subject to lender approval.
[02:53:59.924 --> 02:54:01.024]  We're sending out an SOS.
[02:54:01.044 --> 02:54:01.484]  Just a castaway.
[02:54:23.795 --> 02:54:34.003]  Out of everything Dr. Group has taught me, and all the products he's developed for us, many of them proprietary, just m4slife.com, the results have been so dramatic, it's insane.
[02:54:36.225 --> 02:54:42.830]  And then with this, it was so dramatic eight days in, because I did it for six days, nothing happened.
[02:54:43.831 --> 02:54:47.113]  I was calling him, I was talking to Anthony, I said, it hadn't happened.
[02:54:47.153 --> 02:54:48.294]  He said, just wait, just wait.
[02:54:48.675 --> 02:54:48.975]  It did.
[02:54:50.953 --> 02:54:52.800]  I know one person it didn't work on.
[02:54:53.181 --> 02:54:56.171]  It works on almost something like 97% of people we've talked to.
[02:54:56.997 --> 02:55:00.419]  And I guess that means they either don't have any stones or they're really backed up.
[02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:04.702]  Dr. Group, are there any dangers to flushing out these gallstones?
[02:55:04.762 --> 02:55:06.503]  I mean, are they naturally supposed to be there?
[02:55:06.964 --> 02:55:08.965]  Are kidney stones and things like that good for you?
[02:55:08.985 --> 02:55:10.186]  I've always heard they're bad, right?
[02:55:10.826 --> 02:55:11.787]  Oh, they're not good for you.
[02:55:11.807 --> 02:55:13.388]  They're not supposed to be there.
[02:55:13.728 --> 02:55:17.050]  It's all caused by the environment that we put into ourselves.
[02:55:17.091 --> 02:55:19.232]  But you're asking if there's anything bad.
[02:55:19.332 --> 02:55:26.277]  You know, people who have really, really toxic livers, probably the worst symptom that could happen is that they might throw up.
[02:55:27.958 --> 02:55:35.945]  Some of that throwing up is maybe just a response from drinking the olive oil, but also it could mean that they're extremely toxic.
[02:55:36.005 --> 02:55:49.898]  So the liver cleanse, they might have some stomach pain, they might have a headache, some detoxification symptoms, but the whole purpose of us choosing the herbs that we chose, such as turmeric is in the formula, and that
[02:55:50.458 --> 02:55:50.898]  I'm good.
[02:56:07.114 --> 02:56:10.837]  And it helps support the gallbladder, jaundice, repair of the liver.
[02:56:10.857 --> 02:56:13.258]  It has strong antioxidants in it.
[02:56:13.799 --> 02:56:19.543]  And the milk thistle seed that we put in there has been used for over 2,000 years for liver and gallbladder support.
[02:56:19.603 --> 02:56:22.825]  It helps detoxify your system from alcohol.
[02:56:22.845 --> 02:56:25.447]  It helps regenerate damaged liver tissue.
[02:56:26.308 --> 02:56:31.992]  You can look on PubMed and find all kinds of studies on some of these herbs that we chose, especially milk thistle.
[02:56:32.492 --> 02:56:43.079]  But we also use a rare herb called Chanka Piedra, and it was known in the rainforest herbal shamans as stone breaker.
[02:56:43.539 --> 02:56:51.325]  And what this herb does is it actually breaks down kidney stones, liver stones, gallbladder stones over a period of time.
[02:56:51.765 --> 02:56:53.866]  And all of these things are in the liver shield.
[02:56:53.886 --> 02:56:58.649]  And that's why you take the liver shield for four or five days before you do the olive oil.
[02:56:59.070 --> 02:57:01.932]  So you're turning those hard stones into
[02:57:02.933 --> 02:57:10.363]  Sponges, almost like sponges, are breaking them down into little tiny soft pieces so they can easily pass.
[02:57:10.723 --> 02:57:19.695]  Now, if you were to go and just drink a bunch of olive oil right now, you might have a scenario where you pass a hard stone or maybe a stone gets stuck in your bile duct coming out.
[02:57:20.276 --> 02:57:27.520]  But I've always told people the most effective cleanse and the hardest cleanse for you to do is to purge your liver.
[02:57:27.881 --> 02:57:31.503]  It's just drinking the olive oil is really the hardest part.
[02:57:31.523 --> 02:57:32.443]  It makes perfect sense.
[02:57:32.463 --> 02:57:34.244]  I mean, we clean out the garbage disposal.
[02:57:34.284 --> 02:57:36.406]  We clean out every other kind of filter.
[02:57:36.966 --> 02:57:46.092]  Cool filters, whatever, clean out the liver, but they're not going to make a bunch of money off of you giving you a liver transplant or whatever down the road, you know, if you get your liver healthy outside of their system.
[02:57:46.392 --> 02:57:47.453]  We're not making any claims.
[02:57:47.573 --> 02:57:49.154]  All I know is this works incredibly good.
[02:57:49.534 --> 02:57:51.496]  In closing, Dr. Grip, I want to thank you for your help.
[02:57:51.976 --> 02:57:57.320]  Thank you for working with us, because I know you're a really choosy guy, one of the most successful people in the country in all this.
[02:57:57.640 --> 02:57:58.741]  They're at the Global Healing Center.
[02:57:59.679 --> 02:58:01.301]  How often should I do a liver cleanse?
[02:58:01.401 --> 02:58:03.003]  I mean, I've done two.
[02:58:03.023 --> 02:58:06.967]  I mean, I guess I did the first one about six months ago, another one about three months later.
[02:58:06.987 --> 02:58:08.889]  It wasn't as dramatic, but there was some.
[02:58:09.229 --> 02:58:12.313]  Do I want to do it every few months until nothing comes out?
[02:58:13.294 --> 02:58:13.574]  Right.
[02:58:13.634 --> 02:58:22.778]  Well, what we found is that pretty much anyone over 40 needs to do three liver cleanses over, let's say, maybe a couple-month period.
[02:58:23.119 --> 02:58:28.981]  So they do a liver cleanse and wait a week or so just to rest, and then do another cleanse, wait a week, do another cleanse.
[02:58:29.421 --> 02:58:32.063]  And three is kind of a magic number.
[02:58:32.103 --> 02:58:35.584]  The third liver cleanse, the sixth liver cleanse, and the ninth liver cleanse.
[02:58:35.644 --> 02:58:39.926]  For some reason, we've seen the best results in multiples of three.
[02:58:41.667 --> 02:58:41.887]  Sure.
[02:58:42.048 --> 02:58:42.288]  Wow.
[02:58:42.428 --> 02:58:42.688]  You know what?
[02:58:42.708 --> 02:58:43.990]  Do five more minutes with us, folks.
[02:58:44.090 --> 02:58:45.272]  The new product is here.
[02:58:45.332 --> 02:58:46.413]  It funds the InfoWars.
[02:58:46.673 --> 02:58:48.015]  It's high-quality liver shield.
[02:58:48.455 --> 02:58:50.117]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:58:50.177 --> 02:58:51.459]  And it comes with the Oxy-Powder.
[02:58:51.819 --> 02:58:54.763]  When you get it as part of the Advanced Cleanse Pack, discounted.
[02:58:59.710 --> 02:59:19.277]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show, or the nightly news, or the news website, InfoWars.com, because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality, and they weren't as affordable as they should be, so I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[02:59:19.457 --> 02:59:19.877]  Well then,
[02:59:20.217 --> 02:59:23.881]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[02:59:24.122 --> 02:59:25.523]  Hdfirearms.com.
[02:59:25.824 --> 02:59:29.027]  Owned and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, Special Ops people.
[02:59:29.127 --> 02:59:34.033]  They're veterans, they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.
[02:59:34.253 --> 02:59:35.094]  It's always about security.
[02:59:35.094 --> 02:59:35.474]  I think so.
[03:00:02.311 --> 03:00:04.927]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.495 --> 03:00:18.519]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:19.139 --> 03:00:22.161]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:22.742 --> 03:00:28.085]  You know, I'm gonna shoot a special report for the Nightly News on this subject as it ties in.
[03:00:28.986 --> 03:00:33.249]  Mom, who advocated medical cannabis oil, faces 30 years in prison.
[03:00:35.630 --> 03:00:37.932]  And it's well known to help Crohn's disease.
[03:00:37.952 --> 03:00:39.673]  They're even trying to patent it right now.
[03:00:41.274 --> 03:00:42.015]  But this mom,
[03:00:43.666 --> 03:00:50.647]  Her son made pro-medical marijuana comments at school about how his mom treated her Crohn's disease with it.
[03:00:52.148 --> 03:00:56.949]  And the police raided the Garden City home in March after her son made the comments.
[03:00:57.529 --> 03:00:58.449]  She booked herself in.
[03:00:58.469 --> 03:01:01.129]  She's facing 30 years in prison.
[03:01:01.950 --> 03:01:04.550]  Because I guess in that state, it's still a total police state.
[03:01:05.450 --> 03:01:08.351]  I mean, what a sick joke that we allow this to go on.
[03:01:09.674 --> 03:01:13.056]  And this just shows how crazy it's all gotten.
[03:01:13.476 --> 03:01:21.399]  KMUW is also reporting on this with a straight face like it's a, you know, I guess a good idea.
[03:01:21.939 --> 03:01:28.482]  Garden City woman surrenders post bond and high-profile medical marijuana case in the Finley County law enforcement.
[03:01:30.623 --> 03:01:31.543]  And what state is that?
[03:01:31.563 --> 03:01:34.845]  I know there's a Garden City in Missouri, one in Michigan.
[03:01:36.587 --> 03:01:37.587]  It's in Kansas, yeah.
[03:01:37.868 --> 03:01:38.528]  It's in Kansas.
[03:01:39.408 --> 03:01:40.449]  I mean, that is just sickening.
[03:01:40.489 --> 03:01:44.651]  Dr. Group, finishing up with just the medical tyranny in this country.
[03:01:45.551 --> 03:01:46.872]  I don't imbibe in marijuana.
[03:01:47.887 --> 03:01:56.371]  But I know it's known to help with glaucoma, it's known to help with nausea, it's known to help with irritable, just hundreds of things.
[03:01:56.811 --> 03:02:00.793]  It's certainly got medical uses, and most people have smoked it or do smoke it.
[03:02:00.853 --> 03:02:07.296]  I don't get how you give a woman 30 years in prison or how 11-year-olds get taken from their parents because they were playing basketball in the backyard.
[03:02:07.316 --> 03:02:09.537]  I mean, what country do we live in?
[03:02:11.314 --> 03:02:16.578]  We live in a pretty sick country, but people are actually getting more educated and more educated.
[03:02:16.618 --> 03:02:18.259]  I think that's crazy.
[03:02:19.319 --> 03:02:25.564]  You know, the hemp plant is the closest natural plant to the oil that the human body secretes.
[03:02:25.624 --> 03:02:32.748]  It's only one carbon off, so it's the most natural, and it's got the most medicinal uses than any other natural plant in the world.
[03:02:33.269 --> 03:02:38.372]  It's highly effective for a multitude of different conditions, including detoxification.
[03:02:38.892 --> 03:02:40.914]  But what it all boils down to really is,
[03:02:41.974 --> 03:02:47.356]  You know, even if you're a natural practitioner, really people should be looking at not treating disease.
[03:02:47.396 --> 03:02:55.238]  Like the real definition of a doctor should be a teacher and not a prescriber and someone that teaches you how to heal yourself.
[03:02:55.658 --> 03:02:59.279]  And it all boils back down to we're not treating disease with all these supplements.
[03:02:59.319 --> 03:03:00.199]  That's what we're not doing.
[03:03:00.239 --> 03:03:08.702]  All we're doing is cleaning your body so your body's self-healing mechanism can reactivate and your body can heal whatever condition
[03:03:09.202 --> 03:03:09.844]  That you have.
[03:03:09.884 --> 03:03:18.382]  And that's all we're doing with cleaning the intestines, cleaning the liver and gallbladder, cleaning all the metals, the parasites, all the other gunk out so the body can actually heal itself.
[03:03:22.495 --> 03:03:36.607]  That's why I recommend everybody, you know, start looking at their diet, evaluating all the chemicals they're putting into their system, you know, doing multiple liver and gallbladder cleanses so their liver can function again, because think of all the things people are exposed to every single day.
[03:03:37.308 --> 03:03:45.795]  You know, millions of chemicals, millions of toxins in the food supply, the water, the beverages, everything else, and it all goes to one tiny little organ
[03:03:46.696 --> 03:03:54.127]  Through your intestines and then it goes into your bloodstream to your liver and the liver is, when the liver's congested, then everything else starts.
[03:03:54.167 --> 03:03:55.949]  I mean, that's where all your symptoms begin.
[03:03:55.969 --> 03:03:58.193]  Well, Dr. Group, here's what it comes down to.
[03:03:59.722 --> 03:04:13.786]  I cannot get excited enough, and I don't want to come off like a carnival barker, about taking the liver shield with the organic apple cider vinegar and your oxy powder six days.
[03:04:14.526 --> 03:04:17.867]  It is explosive, quite literally, what happens.
[03:04:17.927 --> 03:04:20.868]  And you realize that that was in me, and that's only part of it.
[03:04:21.428 --> 03:04:24.272]  I mean, no wonder I had so much more energy right after it happened.
[03:04:24.972 --> 03:04:27.015]  No wonder my skin's so much... that's so much better.
[03:04:27.495 --> 03:04:34.384]  I know only a fraction of people who even believe me, most people do, they know I don't make stuff up, are gonna actually buy this and try it.
[03:04:35.620 --> 03:04:47.186]  I mean, for the money you spend, and you're funding the InfoWar, a win-win, it's just, I don't know how I had this weird cognitive dissonance and didn't want to do it when you were pushing me to do it a year and a half ago.
[03:04:47.507 --> 03:04:49.548]  But I want to thank you for pushing me so hard.
[03:04:50.268 --> 03:04:51.749]  You're just awesome, Dr. Group.
[03:04:52.369 --> 03:04:58.973]  Get the liver shield alone, or the liver shield advanced cleanse, both at InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:04:58.993 --> 03:04:59.633]  Thank you so much, Dr. Group.
[03:05:03.095 --> 03:05:03.936]  Thanks for having me on.
[03:05:03.956 --> 03:05:04.596]  Appreciate it.
[03:05:04.796 --> 03:05:05.556]  Stay dry down there.
[03:05:05.576 --> 03:05:06.937]  He couldn't even get up here because of the flooding.
[03:05:06.957 --> 03:05:08.278]  The state's getting flooded.
[03:05:10.079 --> 03:05:10.779]  Transmission.
