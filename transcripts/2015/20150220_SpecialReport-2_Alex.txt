[00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:14.142]  This is Rob Doo for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:14.343 --> 00:00:34.823]  This is going to be another vaccine report, and I hope at the end of this report that you will come to realize that just because we don't agree with the medical establishment that we aren't wrong, we aren't crazy, we aren't conspiracy theorists, and that there's a lot of facts and a lot of studies behind the reasoning for people not wanting to vaccinate themselves and their children.
[00:00:36.172 --> 00:00:43.097]  So I hope this report will put all that to rest and all the vaccine pushing and all the vaccine hysteria that's going on in this country.
[00:00:43.657 --> 00:00:49.862]  Because this is a first step on a long line of tyrannies that are lined up if they get their way.
[00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:53.945]  If they're able to push mandatory vaccines onto people, it's over for everything.
[00:00:54.465 --> 00:01:00.950]  You see some of the largest outbreaks in states where they have personal health exemptions or religious exemptions.
[00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.211]  Do we need to rethink those?
[00:01:02.722 --> 00:01:10.086]  We're going to start this off with a little exchange between Senator Elizabeth Warren and Dr. Schuchat who works at the CDC.
[00:01:11.707 --> 00:01:14.808]  This is what I call the beauty pageant of vaccines.
[00:01:14.868 --> 00:01:19.791]  They throw softball questions at the officials and the officials throw back the canned answers.
[00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:21.452]  So let's look at this exchange.
[00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:27.254]  Dr. Sciocca, you are the top immunization official in the United States.
[00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:30.098]  I just want to walk through the science on this with you.
[00:01:30.678 --> 00:01:35.444]  Is there any scientific evidence that vaccines cause autism?
[00:01:35.784 --> 00:01:35.964]  No.
[00:01:36.865 --> 00:01:42.732]  Is there any scientific evidence that vaccines cause profound mental disorders?
[00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:46.504]  No, but some of the diseases we vaccinate against can.
[00:01:46.784 --> 00:01:54.287]  Is there any scientific evidence that vaccines have contributed to the rise in allergies or autoimmune disorders among kids?
[00:01:54.888 --> 00:01:55.088]  No.
[00:01:56.148 --> 00:02:01.131]  Are there additives or preservatives in vaccines that can be toxic to kids?
[00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:03.992]  No, not in the amounts that they're in vaccines.
[00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:14.462]  Is there any scientific evidence that kids can develop immunity to these diseases on their own simply by eating nutritious foods or being active?
[00:02:14.762 --> 00:02:15.023]  No.
[00:02:15.963 --> 00:02:26.651]  How do the risks of a child responding negatively to a vaccination compare with the risks of skipping vaccinations and risking exposure to a deadly disease?
[00:02:27.572 --> 00:02:33.736]  Vaccines are safe and highly effective and it's important for parents to know they're the best way to protect their kids.
[00:02:34.042 --> 00:02:35.624]  So you heard it from the officials.
[00:02:58.336 --> 00:03:00.759]  That there's no problem with vaccines whatsoever.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.701]  Perfectly clean record.
[00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:04.003]  Nothing to worry about.
[00:03:04.043 --> 00:03:05.805]  Go out and get your child shot up today.
[00:03:05.825 --> 00:03:07.687]  Especially with that MMR, right?
[00:03:08.632 --> 00:03:11.173]  In fact, I get sent this study a lot.
[00:03:11.493 --> 00:03:13.314]  I'm going to read it out to you, so you can go read it yourself.
[00:03:13.774 --> 00:03:15.714]  Vaccines are not associated with autism.
[00:03:15.954 --> 00:03:20.076]  An evidence-based meta-analysis of case control and cohort studies.
[00:03:21.256 --> 00:03:27.758]  Basically what this has done is three doctors looked at, I don't know, 15, 20 different studies that all said vaccines are safe.
[00:03:28.198 --> 00:03:31.680]  So then they came up with the same conclusion, that vaccines were safe.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.741]  What's interesting is if you go to the epilogue of this study.
[00:03:36.593 --> 00:03:39.795]  One of the doctors, Dr. Guy Eslick, says this,
[00:03:57.318 --> 00:04:00.221]  These events did not stop me from vaccinating my third child, however.
[00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:04.224]  I did take some proactive measures to reduce the risk of similar adverse effects.
[00:04:04.765 --> 00:04:17.896]  I vaccinated my child in the morning so that we were aware if any early adverse reaction during the day, and I also gave my child a dose of Tylenol 30 minutes before the vaccination was given to reduce any fever that might develop after the injection.
[00:04:18.817 --> 00:04:29.043]  So the doctor in this study admits that two of his children had adverse reactions to vaccines, one of them very serious, yet he still vaccinated his third child.
[00:04:29.604 --> 00:04:36.728]  This is because of the intense programming doctors go under by this Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundation funded medicine paradigm.
[00:04:37.168 --> 00:04:43.212]  Which is only vaccines, only prescription drugs, that is the only thing that can save you.
[00:04:43.413 --> 00:04:43.893]  Nothing else.
[00:04:43.993 --> 00:04:52.960]  Herbal remedies don't work, vitamins don't work, nothing else works unless it came from a Rockefeller Foundation company or a Carnegie Foundation company.
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.820]  Okay?
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.302]  And those are your big pharma companies that exist now.
[00:04:56.362 --> 00:04:59.825]  These chemical giants that don't want anything out there natural.
[00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:03.928]  They have to synthesize everything because they're afraid of natural competition.
[00:05:04.977 --> 00:05:08.502]  Furthermore, in this study, they list all the studies that they look at.
[00:05:09.203 --> 00:05:15.130]  One of which caught my eye, and it was a population-based study of measles, mumps, and rubella, vaccination, and autism.
[00:05:15.996 --> 00:05:22.401]  One of the doctors in this, Paul Thorson, MD, is wanted by the CDC for massive fraud.
[00:05:22.441 --> 00:05:29.686]  He was taking funds and grants that were supposed to be given to him for research and funneling them into his personal bank accounts.
[00:05:30.307 --> 00:05:32.128]  How much credibility can we take in this?
[00:05:32.908 --> 00:05:42.976]  And now let's look at some actual studies that are being done that show vaccines do cause harm, quite contrary to what you just saw in the exchange between Senator Warren and the doctor from the CDC.
[00:05:44.402 --> 00:05:50.561]  Vaccines are safe and highly effective and it's important for parents to know they're the best way to protect their kids.
[00:05:51.138 --> 00:05:56.340]  First article, activist post, 22 medical studies that show vaccines can cause autism.
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.101]  And they list the studies down here.
[00:05:58.181 --> 00:06:06.325]  They're in the journals of epidemiology, journal of inorganic biochemistry, study in the journal of toxicology and environmental health.
[00:06:06.785 --> 00:06:08.005]  These are reputable papers.
[00:06:08.526 --> 00:06:11.507]  And all these say there's a problem with vaccines.
[00:06:12.307 --> 00:06:18.450]  Yet, I guess our CDC officials didn't have time to read these studies because they don't say vaccines are safe and effective.
[00:06:18.632 --> 00:06:20.913]  They're very effective and they're very safe.
[00:06:21.213 --> 00:06:23.254]  Modern vaccines are safe.
[00:06:23.814 --> 00:06:25.855]  Modern vaccines are effective.
[00:06:25.915 --> 00:06:27.416]  Vaccine is safe and effective.
[00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:29.036]  It is a safe form of flu vaccine.
[00:06:29.096 --> 00:06:30.797]  It's very effective in preventing the flu.
[00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:33.358]  Vaccines are important, safe, and effective.
[00:06:33.946 --> 00:06:36.688]  Vaccines are safe and highly effective.
[00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:37.349]  Here's more.
[00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:39.070]  Journal of Biomedical Sciences.
[00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.672]  The Annals of Clinical Psychiatry.
[00:06:41.052 --> 00:06:42.773]  American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
[00:06:43.114 --> 00:06:45.215]  Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences.
[00:06:45.656 --> 00:06:47.537]  Journal of Child Neurology.
[00:06:47.557 --> 00:06:50.139]  A study conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital.
[00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:55.364]  You can read the synopsis of each one of these studies and then it has links to these studies so you can go read them yourself.
[00:06:55.424 --> 00:06:56.364]  I encourage you to do this.
[00:06:56.685 --> 00:06:57.265]  Spend a night.
[00:06:57.485 --> 00:06:58.906]  Your child's health is worth it.
[00:06:59.247 --> 00:06:59.987]  Let's continue.
[00:07:00.968 --> 00:07:05.773]  Polish study confirms vaccines can cause a large number of adverse effects.
[00:07:06.534 --> 00:07:17.125]  And they say, it is not reasonable to assume that manipulation of the immune system through an increasing number of vaccinations during critical periods of brain development will not result in adverse neurodevelopment outcomes.
[00:07:17.685 --> 00:07:39.371]  Doctors and researchers point to the worsening state of health of the child population since the 60s, which coincided with the increasingly introduced vaccinations, allergic diseases including asthma, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and many neurological dysfunctions, difficulty in learning, ADD, ADHD, seizures, and autism, and chronic conditions to which their attention has been brought.
[00:07:40.216 --> 00:07:42.698]  Here's another study out of PR Newswire.
[00:07:43.098 --> 00:07:49.042]  Infant vaccines produce autism symptoms in new primate study by the University of Pittsburgh scientists.
[00:07:49.482 --> 00:07:54.566]  And basically what they did was take the basic childhood vaccination schedule and inject it into baby monkeys.
[00:07:54.886 --> 00:07:56.987]  And then they watched them not develop correctly.
[00:07:57.548 --> 00:08:05.373]  And if you look around you, go to any public place where there are kids nowadays, you see a lot of kids that are really messed up and not acting like normal kids.
[00:08:06.373 --> 00:08:06.834]  You'll see it.
[00:08:06.854 --> 00:08:07.434]  Just go out there.
[00:08:07.694 --> 00:08:08.215]  Here's more.
[00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.191]  MMR vaccine isn't safe after all.
[00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:13.291]  UK government forced to concede.
[00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:20.154]  The UK court has ruled that the vaccine caused severe brain damage in a boy now aged 18 and has ordered the government to pay compensation.
[00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:30.057]  Robert was just 13 months old when he had the MMR vaccination and from being a healthy baby who was developing normally, he started to suffer epileptic fits and became unresponsive.
[00:08:30.757 --> 00:08:31.757]  Here's another study.
[00:08:32.217 --> 00:08:36.279]  A measles outbreak at a college with a pre-matriculation immunization requirement.
[00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:46.502]  In early 1988, an outbreak of 84 measles cases occurred at a college in Colorado in which over 98% of the students had documentation of adequate measles immunity.
[00:08:47.162 --> 00:08:53.927]  Over 70, that's 83% of the cases had been vaccinated at greater than or equal to the 12 months of age.
[00:08:54.408 --> 00:08:58.070]  So, fully vaccinated people were still catching the measles.
[00:08:58.551 --> 00:09:02.234]  And they were at a 98% vaccination rate.
[00:09:02.774 --> 00:09:03.815]  Here's a Chinese study.
[00:09:04.095 --> 00:09:07.238]  Difficulties in eliminating measles and controlling rubella and mumps.
[00:09:07.418 --> 00:09:13.682]  A cross-sectional study of a first measles and rubella vaccination and a second measles, mumps and rubella vaccination.
[00:09:14.443 --> 00:09:22.033]  The report coverage of the MR and the MMR vaccine is greater than 99% in the Zhejiang province.
[00:09:22.273 --> 00:09:25.557]  However, the incidence of measles, mumps, and rubella remains high.
[00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:35.058]  Now let's go back to the testimony of Dr. Schuchat over at the CDC, and let's hear what she has to say about what happens if you don't get the measles vaccine and you get the measles.
[00:09:35.178 --> 00:09:36.779]  What are the complications that may occur?
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.144]  Your child contracted measles in the United States, the chances of a death would be about 1 in 1,000.
[00:09:42.505 --> 00:09:48.450]  That's right, but remember there are other problems with measles, not just that rare risk of dying.
[00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.872]  There are other complications besides death.
[00:09:50.953 --> 00:09:52.194]  Children can get pneumonia.
[00:09:52.594 --> 00:09:54.016]  They can get dehydration.
[00:09:54.416 --> 00:09:59.541]  They can also get a neurologic problem, encephalitis, which can be quite scary and severe.
[00:09:59.902 --> 00:10:02.504]  So she says death, pneumonia, encephalitis.
[00:10:02.905 --> 00:10:12.454]  Coincidentally, those are three things listed in the insert, which they don't show you when you go get your vaccination, of side effects that have been documented with the MMR vaccine.
[00:10:12.955 --> 00:10:14.637]  Hmm, makes you wonder, doesn't it?
[00:10:15.626 --> 00:10:20.328]  Family to receive 1.5 million in first-ever vaccine autism court award.
[00:10:20.889 --> 00:10:22.569]  It took many years, but this occurred in 2010.
[00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.551]  It's a young lady named Hannah Poling.
[00:10:26.707 --> 00:10:31.210]  In July 2000, Hannah was vaccinated against nine diseases in one doctor's visit.
[00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:36.673]  Measles, mumps, rubella, polio, varicella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and haemophilius influenza.
[00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:38.594]  Afterward, her health declined rapidly.
[00:10:38.654 --> 00:10:44.797]  She developed high fever, stopped eating, didn't respond when spoken to, began showing signs of autism, and began having screaming fits.
[00:10:45.238 --> 00:10:49.340]  In 2002, Hannah's parents filed an autism claim in federal vaccine court.
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.062]  Five years later, the government settled the case before trial.
[00:10:52.842 --> 00:10:54.004]  And had it sealed.
[00:10:54.665 --> 00:10:56.168]  Here's what Hannah's parents had to say.
[00:10:56.228 --> 00:11:02.077]  Her dad is actually a neurosurgeon, so these aren't just crazy parents thinking that vaccines caused the injury.
[00:11:02.258 --> 00:11:03.820]  Here's what they had to say in Good Morning America.
[00:11:04.616 --> 00:11:08.959]  I think the bottom line is our daughter was born normal.
[00:11:09.059 --> 00:11:11.942]  She developed normally for the first 18 months of life.
[00:11:12.402 --> 00:11:15.244]  There were no signs of any underlying genetic disorder.
[00:11:15.645 --> 00:11:16.846]  Then she was vaccinated.
[00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:17.886]  She became ill.
[00:11:18.347 --> 00:11:22.150]  That illness eventually led to a diagnosis of autism, then later seizures.
[00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.531]  I think that's the bottom line.
[00:11:24.511 --> 00:11:26.313]  Vaccines were related to her illness.
[00:11:26.613 --> 00:11:29.995]  Hannah's story in many ways doesn't sound that unfamiliar to us.
[00:11:30.455 --> 00:11:35.637]  Seemed like a normal child and something seemed to change, didn't seem to be genetic, didn't seem to make sense.
[00:11:36.058 --> 00:11:39.139]  What do you believe the message is out there for other parents?
[00:11:39.379 --> 00:11:45.002]  Hannah's case and as other parents out there hear her story, I think her case is echoed among thousands of other
[00:11:46.063 --> 00:12:01.756]  Interestingly enough, if you or your child is injured by a vaccine, you have to go to a special court.
[00:12:02.337 --> 00:12:10.324]  And this is a court with no jury, it's got a special judge, it's different rules, and there's no reporters allowed, nobody's allowed to even see the evidence.
[00:12:10.644 --> 00:12:12.906]  It's just presided over in a secret tribunal.
[00:12:13.146 --> 00:12:19.188]  If federal health officials oppose compensation, the case is argued before a special master in the U.S.
[00:12:19.248 --> 00:12:19.909]  Claims Court.
[00:12:20.689 --> 00:12:35.415]  Many refer to this as vaccine court, though it isn't a court at all, but rather an administrative procedure in which the family asks the government to admit the vaccine caused their child harm and requests compensation for the child's care.
[00:12:36.315 --> 00:12:40.597]  Pharmaceutical companies do not have to participate in the proceedings at all.
[00:12:41.438 --> 00:12:44.199]  Taxpayers pay for all damages.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:45.780]  The U.S.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:51.163]  Department of Justice acts as the government's lawyer, with taxpayers footing the bill for their defense.
[00:12:52.064 --> 00:12:57.547]  The family's attorney is paid out of the trust fund, administered by the Department of Health and Human Services.
[00:12:58.127 --> 00:13:05.491]  There's no required discovery process, so potentially incriminating documents stay hidden in the hands of the vaccine manufacturers.
[00:13:07.819 --> 00:13:09.459]  Most hearings are off-limits.
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.860]  No public, no reporters.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.741]  There's no judge or jury.
[00:13:15.181 --> 00:13:17.281]  A special master appointed by the U.S.
[00:13:17.361 --> 00:13:24.823]  Court of Federal Claims both presides over the hearings and issues the rulings, which can limit the chance of an objective verdict.
[00:13:25.543 --> 00:13:33.445]  Since 1989, this court has awarded over $2.6 billion to people injured by vaccines.
[00:13:34.065 --> 00:13:36.306]  Doesn't sound very safe and effective to me.
[00:13:37.355 --> 00:13:39.017]  And this is money that you and I have to pay.
[00:13:39.317 --> 00:13:41.520]  This doesn't come out of the drug companies' pockets.
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.462]  This is paid for by the federal government.
[00:13:43.582 --> 00:13:44.183]  Remember that.
[00:13:45.364 --> 00:13:54.274]  And this is from the Health Resources and Services Administration National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program Statistics Report, issued March 5, 2014.
[00:13:55.656 --> 00:13:57.698]  Very current statistics, not even a year old.
[00:13:58.547 --> 00:13:59.487]  Now let's go over to Europe.
[00:14:00.068 --> 00:14:01.508]  MMR, a mother's victory.
[00:14:01.849 --> 00:14:05.070]  Valentino Bocca was never the same child after the jab in his arm.
[00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:14.214]  He developed autism, and in a landmark judgment, a judge has ruled that his devastating disability was provoked by the inoculation against measles, mumps, and rubella.
[00:14:14.515 --> 00:14:17.896]  That's the MMR vaccine that they say is safe and effective.
[00:14:17.916 --> 00:14:22.118]  Okay, so they've awarded his family over a million dollars.
[00:14:22.819 --> 00:14:23.499]  Here's another one.
[00:14:23.959 --> 00:14:24.239]  U.S.
[00:14:24.299 --> 00:14:25.040]  media blackout.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.561]  Italian courts rule vaccines cause autism.
[00:14:28.407 --> 00:14:35.496]  The Italian infant Plative received three doses of GlaxoSmithKline Inference Hexa, a hexavalent vaccine administered in the first year of life.
[00:14:36.216 --> 00:14:38.419]  These doses occurred from March to October 2006.
[00:14:38.479 --> 00:14:42.965]  The child regressed into autism shortly after receiving the three doses.
[00:14:44.087 --> 00:14:47.810]  Presiding Judge Nicola DeLeo considered another piece of damning evidence.
[00:14:48.311 --> 00:15:02.663]  A 1,200-page confidential GlaxoSmithKline report, the industry document provided ample evidence of adverse reactions from the vaccine, including five known cases of autism resulting from the vaccine's administration during its clinical trials.
[00:15:03.163 --> 00:15:08.307]  So they've known back in the trials that there's problems with these vaccines, yet they keep pushing them.
[00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:09.488]  They keep ramping them up.
[00:15:09.528 --> 00:15:10.549]  They keep giving you more.
[00:15:10.689 --> 00:15:11.290]  Why is that?
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.280]  H.G.
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:23.805]  Wells, Aldous Huxley, Bertrand Russell, and hundreds of other eugenicists constantly bragged about how the establishment believed themselves to be a separate, more advanced species than the common man.
[00:15:25.565 --> 00:15:34.829]  Top eugenicists were bold enough to admit that their real goal was not improving the heredity of the commoner, but to further dumb them down so that they could be more manageable.
[00:15:36.206 --> 00:15:48.315]  Nobel Prize winner Russell wrote at length about how vaccinations filled with mercury and other brain damaging compounds would induce partial chemical lobotomies and develop a servile zombie population.
[00:15:49.355 --> 00:15:58.162]  Diet, injections and injunctions will combine from a very early age to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable.
[00:15:58.602 --> 00:16:03.045]  And any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible.
[00:16:03.405 --> 00:16:04.046]  Bertrand Russell.
[00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:10.874]  So they knew in clinical trials that that hexavalent vaccine could cause autism, yet they continued with it.
[00:16:11.454 --> 00:16:15.456]  There's a 1,200 page memo talking about it and they hid it from the public.
[00:16:16.096 --> 00:16:26.440]  Because they don't want you to know that vaccines are dangerous, they're not safe and effective, especially the way they're currently made with these multi-dose when you're injecting several different live viruses into your body.
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.921]  They're not safe and they're not effective.
[00:16:30.267 --> 00:16:32.269]  And now let's look at Dr. Andrew Wakefield.
[00:16:32.309 --> 00:16:42.677]  This is the discredited man that they talk about so often in all these reports, articles, television specials, congressional hearings.
[00:16:42.997 --> 00:16:45.639]  In fact, here's Dr. Schuchat talking about him once again.
[00:16:46.761 --> 00:16:47.141]  Autism
[00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:08.820]  And are a good way to protect your children from vaccine-preventable diseases.
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.381]  That article was just flat wrong.
[00:17:11.741 --> 00:17:12.181]  That's right.
[00:17:12.561 --> 00:17:15.242]  And that numerous studies have showed that it was wrong.
[00:17:15.442 --> 00:17:15.843]  That's right.
[00:17:15.883 --> 00:17:18.263]  And what happened to the author of the article?
[00:17:18.804 --> 00:17:20.424]  He lost his medical license.
[00:17:20.624 --> 00:17:21.324]  Because why?
[00:17:21.685 --> 00:17:23.325]  Because of the fraudulent behavior.
[00:17:23.745 --> 00:17:24.666]  Totally discredited.
[00:17:24.726 --> 00:17:25.646]  Nothing more to see here.
[00:17:26.126 --> 00:17:26.826]  Move along.
[00:17:27.166 --> 00:17:34.649]  But British court throws out conviction of autism vaccine MD Andrew Wakefield's co-author completely exonerated.
[00:17:35.745 --> 00:17:49.074]  Gastroenterologist Professor John Walker Smith won his appeal against the United Kingdom's General Medical Council Regulatory Board that had ruled against both him and Andrew Wakefield for their roles in the 1998 Lancet MMR paper which raised the question about a link to autism.
[00:17:49.834 --> 00:17:55.418]  Justice John Minning ruled that the panel's determination cannot stand, therefore I quash it, he said.
[00:17:55.518 --> 00:18:01.903]  Its conclusions were based on inadequate and superficial reasoning in a number of instances, a wrong conclusion.
[00:18:02.583 --> 00:18:07.910]  The verdict restores Walker Smith's name to the medical registry and his reputation to the medical community.
[00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:14.398]  Now we had Dr. Wakefield on the show recently and this is what he had to say about his version of this.
[00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:18.612]  We listened to parents who said that my child was perfectly normal.
[00:18:18.672 --> 00:18:19.713]  I'm not anti-vaccine.
[00:18:19.793 --> 00:18:21.173]  I took my child to get vaccinated.
[00:18:21.614 --> 00:18:24.415]  When I did that, they got the MMR and they regressed into autism.
[00:18:25.216 --> 00:18:27.717]  And they also developed gastrointestinal symptoms.
[00:18:27.797 --> 00:18:34.481]  And as a physician interested in gastrointestinal disease, I recommended those children should get investigated for that.
[00:18:34.541 --> 00:18:40.465]  They were investigated by the world's leading pediatric gastroenterologist at the time, Professor Walker-Smith, who you've just mentioned.
[00:18:41.065 --> 00:18:45.486]  My co-author on the paper, and he found that they had an inflammatory bowel disease.
[00:18:45.547 --> 00:18:46.667]  We treated that disease.
[00:18:46.727 --> 00:18:52.749]  Not only did the bowel disease symptoms improve, but the behavioral and autistic symptoms improved.
[00:18:52.789 --> 00:19:01.472]  It was the beginning of a fascinating journey, but we had to investigate whether the parents were also right about whether the vaccine had precipitated this.
[00:19:01.752 --> 00:19:02.812]  That's when the problem started.
[00:19:03.698 --> 00:19:22.851]  And so Murdoch's brought his team of journalists along, Brian Deer, they came up with this extraordinary story that we had involved ourselves in fraud and deception, that we had made it up, there was no ethical approval, all of this kind of thing while at the same time holding back from the General Medical Council inquiry vital documents.
[00:19:23.945 --> 00:19:26.808]  ...that showed there was indeed ethical approval for this study.
[00:19:26.868 --> 00:19:32.633]  He knew throughout the investigation and the proceedings that he had in his possession key documents.
[00:19:33.073 --> 00:19:35.075]  That was an obstruction of justice.
[00:19:35.335 --> 00:19:40.479]  And here's an article from 2013 proving that Andrew Wakefield should have been exonerated back then.
[00:19:41.394 --> 00:19:44.417]  But, of course, we have to keep him out there as the boogeyman.
[00:19:44.457 --> 00:19:47.780]  We can't have somebody stepping in on Big Pharma's money-making machine.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.003]  New published study verifies Andrew Wakefield's research on autism again.
[00:19:52.203 --> 00:19:53.885]  MMR causes autism.
[00:19:54.505 --> 00:20:07.357]  In a December 13, 2012 vaccine court ruling, hundreds of thousands of dollars were awarded to Ryan Majabi, whose parents describe how the MMR vaccine causes severe, debilitating injury to his brain diagnosed as autism spectrum disorder.
[00:20:08.143 --> 00:20:12.939]  Is there any scientific evidence that vaccines cause autism?
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:13.380]  No.
[00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:25.113]  Later that same month, the government suffered a second major defeat when Emily Moyer from Houston won compensation following a vaccine-related brain injury that once again involved the MMR and resulted in autism.
[00:20:25.453 --> 00:20:27.633]  And you could go down and read all the links for yourself.
[00:20:28.074 --> 00:20:29.294]  I encourage you to do it.
[00:20:29.774 --> 00:20:30.094]  Okay?
[00:20:30.694 --> 00:20:38.896]  I'm just going to keep putting out this evidence as long as the mainstream media is pushing that vaccines are safe and effective and that people who don't vaccinate their children should be forced to.
[00:20:39.316 --> 00:20:40.857]  I'm not going to stop talking about this.
[00:20:41.317 --> 00:20:43.618]  They're very effective and they're very safe.
[00:20:43.918 --> 00:20:45.939]  Modern vaccines are safe.
[00:20:46.499 --> 00:20:48.560]  Modern vaccines are effective.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.100]  Vaccine is safe and effective.
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.721]  It's a safe form of flu vaccine.
[00:20:51.741 --> 00:20:53.501]  It's very effective in preventing the flu.
[00:20:53.562 --> 00:20:56.082]  Vaccines are important, safe and effective.
[00:20:56.663 --> 00:20:59.344]  Vaccines are safe and highly effective.
[00:20:59.784 --> 00:21:04.726]  They're saying by the year 2020, 1 in 10 children will be diagnosed with autism.
[00:21:05.606 --> 00:21:06.566]  Don't you want to know why?
[00:21:07.167 --> 00:21:08.207]  Have you ever thought about that?
[00:21:09.465 --> 00:21:11.987]  I mean, that's not the world that I grew up in.
[00:21:13.107 --> 00:21:14.188]  I was born in the 70s.
[00:21:14.749 --> 00:21:15.869]  Autism was a rare thing.
[00:21:15.889 --> 00:21:17.050]  You never heard about it.
[00:21:17.931 --> 00:21:21.073]  It wasn't until the late 80s that we started hearing about autism.
[00:21:21.553 --> 00:21:23.674]  Right about the time the movie Rain Man came out.
[00:21:24.115 --> 00:21:34.782]  Sort of like a predictive programming vessel to implant in you, hey, if your kid gets autism, he might be pretty cool and be able to count things out and remember interesting facts and answer questions and be really good at music.
[00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:46.142]  You know, they don't tell you about all the other horrible things, where he won't relate to society, you have to change his diapers regularly, he can't feed himself, just all the other debilitating effects.
[00:21:46.182 --> 00:21:48.004]  No, they try to make it cool and trendy.
[00:21:48.444 --> 00:21:49.606]  Well, let's look at that right now.
[00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:51.852]  Here from Dynamic Chiropractic.
[00:21:52.032 --> 00:22:00.441]  An interesting study published in the Human Experimental Toxicology demonstrated a positive relationship between the number of vaccine doses given to infants and infant mortality rates.
[00:22:00.841 --> 00:22:06.627]  In other words, the nations with the highest amount of required immunizations had the highest infant mortality rates.
[00:22:07.148 --> 00:22:15.173]  For example, nations like Netherlands, Canada, Australia, and the United States, which require 24 to 26 vaccine doses, have the highest infant mortality rates.
[00:22:15.293 --> 00:22:23.398]  In contrast, nations like Sweden, Japan, Iceland, Norway, that average 12 required vaccine doses, have the lowest infant mortality rates.
[00:22:23.959 --> 00:22:24.799]  Ironically, the U.S.
[00:22:24.819 --> 00:22:27.361]  has one of the highest infant mortality rates out of 34 nations surveyed.
[00:22:28.982 --> 00:22:36.427]  A companion study also noticed a positive relationship between the number of vaccine doses and hospitalization rates of U.S.
[00:22:36.467 --> 00:22:36.828]  children.
[00:22:37.208 --> 00:22:50.538]  The researchers examined the records from the government's own Vaccine Adverse Reporting System and found that the more vaccines a child receives in earlier life, the more likely the child was to suffer a reaction requiring hospitalization.
[00:22:51.238 --> 00:22:51.879]  Well, there you go.
[00:22:51.959 --> 00:22:55.261]  More money for Big Pharma because of more vaccines.
[00:22:55.321 --> 00:22:57.663]  It's a very devious program they're running here.
[00:22:58.621 --> 00:23:05.684]  David Kessler, former FDA commissioner, estimated only 6% of all vaccine adverse events are reported.
[00:23:06.645 --> 00:23:11.367]  So that means 94% of these adverse reactions are parents that don't even know what's going on.
[00:23:11.647 --> 00:23:14.708]  Their kid's throwing fits, having fevers, and they don't even report it.
[00:23:14.988 --> 00:23:16.229]  They just try to get through it.
[00:23:17.209 --> 00:23:18.230]  That has got to scare you.
[00:23:19.246 --> 00:23:20.327]  And here we go to the boom.
[00:23:20.707 --> 00:23:21.907]  EPA study.
[00:23:22.308 --> 00:23:23.348]  Autism boom began in 1988.
[00:23:24.108 --> 00:23:27.170]  Environmental factors are assumed.
[00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:28.070]  That's right.
[00:23:28.551 --> 00:23:30.232]  It has to be something from the environment.
[00:23:30.692 --> 00:23:31.332]  And maybe it is.
[00:23:31.672 --> 00:23:33.833]  Maybe it's those extra vaccines.
[00:23:33.933 --> 00:23:40.136]  In fact, from Mercola.com is the alarming rise in autism linked to 1988 events.
[00:23:42.179 --> 00:23:47.608]  The first conjugate vaccine against influenza type B, Hib, was approved for use in the U.S.
[00:23:47.688 --> 00:23:55.141]  in 1988, which coincides with a marked increase in reported prevalence of autism spectrum disorders among American children.
[00:23:55.976 --> 00:24:05.127]  Researchers hypothesize that the Hib vaccine may be, in part, responsible for this rise in autism, as conjugate vaccines appear to have a profound impact on neurological development.
[00:24:05.527 --> 00:24:13.176]  These vaccines fundamentally change the manner in which the immune system of infants and young children's function, the authors of a recent study say.
[00:24:14.195 --> 00:24:17.858]  And if you look at a graph that shows autism, it's like this.
[00:24:18.038 --> 00:24:19.079]  Real low, real low.
[00:24:19.099 --> 00:24:22.661]  It starts to rise a little bit in the 80s, probably due to the increased vaccine schedule.
[00:24:23.062 --> 00:24:24.763]  And then at the end of the 80s, boom!
[00:24:24.823 --> 00:24:25.703]  It starts shooting up.
[00:24:26.144 --> 00:24:27.785]  And now we're almost to 1 in 10.
[00:24:28.085 --> 00:24:29.066]  Doesn't that make you happy?
[00:24:29.466 --> 00:24:31.708]  We're going to be number one in autism.
[00:24:32.989 --> 00:24:33.189]  USA!
[00:24:33.369 --> 00:24:33.910]  USA!
[00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:34.590]  USA!
[00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:35.291]  USA!
[00:24:35.751 --> 00:24:36.291]  USA!
[00:24:36.832 --> 00:24:39.033]  USA!
[00:24:39.293 --> 00:24:40.374]  USA!
[00:24:40.634 --> 00:24:42.536]  Alright, now I want to get to the end here.
[00:24:43.937 --> 00:24:46.598]  This is an article by Dr. Russell Blaylock, MD.
[00:24:46.638 --> 00:24:48.038]  We've had him on the show many times.
[00:24:48.118 --> 00:24:49.258]  Retired neurosurgeon.
[00:24:49.558 --> 00:24:53.219]  Just an expert on what goes on in the brain and what affects the brain.
[00:24:53.939 --> 00:24:56.580]  The Danger of Excessive Vaccination During Brain Development.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.980]  He published this in 2008.
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.581]  This is a thick article.
[00:25:00.881 --> 00:25:01.281]  Look at this.
[00:25:02.281 --> 00:25:03.221]  Very thick article.
[00:25:03.781 --> 00:25:07.122]  It's got sections like scientific double standards of vaccine safety.
[00:25:08.171 --> 00:25:10.913]  Compelling link between autism and the vaccination program.
[00:25:11.353 --> 00:25:13.615]  The autism disaster isn't man-made.
[00:25:14.095 --> 00:25:16.677]  Immune dysfunction, the result of bystander damage.
[00:25:17.118 --> 00:25:20.100]  How immune reactions to vaccines differ depending on age.
[00:25:20.761 --> 00:25:24.543]  Autistic children more prone to develop autoimmune diseases and infections.
[00:25:24.964 --> 00:25:29.987]  Immune suppressions by live virus containing vaccines, which is almost every vaccine contains a live virus.
[00:25:30.888 --> 00:25:32.889]  Avoid the flu vaccine during pregnancy.
[00:25:33.229 --> 00:25:35.949]  Contrary to what they tell you now, you've got to get that flu vaccine.
[00:25:35.969 --> 00:25:37.650]  We've got to inject mercury into your baby.
[00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.070]  What about the adjuvants used in vaccines?
[00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:49.072]  I mean, this covers the entire study of what these vaccine ingredients and the live viruses themselves do to your brain and its development.
[00:25:49.492 --> 00:25:51.733]  You need to read this one if you read nothing else.
[00:25:53.436 --> 00:25:58.280]  I want to end this little vaccine extravaganza with a quote from Gandhi.
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.163]  Gandhi's anti-vaccine views ring true a century later.
[00:26:03.339 --> 00:26:10.682]  That's right, Gandhi was not a big fan of vaccines because he saw what they did to his people and they're still hurting his people today with the Bill Gates polio vaccine.
[00:26:11.383 --> 00:26:15.924]  Vaccination is a barbarous practice and one of the most fatal of all delusions current in our time.
[00:26:16.565 --> 00:26:23.428]  Conscientious objectors to vaccination should stand alone if need be against the whole world in defense of their conviction.
[00:26:24.295 --> 00:26:25.516]  And that's what I want you to do out there.
[00:26:25.536 --> 00:26:27.197]  If you feel like you're alone, just stand up.
[00:26:27.237 --> 00:26:29.158]  You will find others out there that are like you.
[00:26:29.498 --> 00:26:32.400]  Others that don't want to bow down to this forced vaccination program.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:47.349]  Because once they force vaccines, they can force drug you, then they can take your children away, then they can tell you where you're going to work, how you're going to work, what kind of house you're going to have, what kind of fuel you can burn in your fireplace, and then they're going to start rounding you up and killing you like cattle when they don't need you anymore.
[00:26:48.329 --> 00:26:50.130]  So you can't let government start now.
[00:26:50.451 --> 00:26:52.332]  You've got to stop them in their tracks.
[00:26:53.146 --> 00:26:59.172]  You need to support legislation out there and support congressmen and senators out there that are for parental choice.
[00:26:59.493 --> 00:27:03.517]  Because we should all have the choice whether we inject live viruses into our body or not.
[00:27:04.138 --> 00:27:07.001]  This has been Rob Dew with InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:27:07.361 --> 00:27:09.584]  Please spread this report around to everybody you know.
[00:27:09.904 --> 00:27:17.232]  I tried to make it the most comprehensive and as short as possible with our current attention deficit disorder we have out there.
[00:27:17.913 --> 00:27:19.495]  With all the people, myself included.
[00:27:19.535 --> 00:27:20.616]  I get a little scatterbrained.
[00:27:20.936 --> 00:27:22.958]  But please, spread this information.
[00:27:23.038 --> 00:27:23.919]  Make it go viral!
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:24.920]  Okay?
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.001]  Make it go viral!
[00:27:26.041 --> 00:27:26.641]  Get it out there!
[00:27:27.081 --> 00:27:34.205]  Let's change the way people think about vaccines, because they're not safe and they're not effective, especially in the current way they're being used.
[00:27:34.545 --> 00:27:37.887]  And also, consider becoming a member of PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:27:48.812 --> 00:27:57.149]  Let's start informing people because there is a war for your mind and your soul and it's happening right now and you either get in the game or you will get run over by the New World Order.
[00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:58.011]  Thank you.
