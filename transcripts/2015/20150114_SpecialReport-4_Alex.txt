[00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:15.790]  My name is Patrick Cook, and I'm a survivor of the Fort Hood shooting that took place on 2 April 2014.
[00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:31.358]  On that day, at approximately 4 in the afternoon, a gunman entered our battalion headquarters, armed with a .45 caliber pistol, and proceeded to prosecute targets of opportunity.
[00:00:36.331 --> 00:01:01.099]  The gunman managed to hit three separate locations on Fort Hood, killed four, including himself, wounded 16, and left countless hundreds more to live with the lingering effects of PTSD, loss, grief, and an irreparably damaged morale.
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.681]  But what I'm not here to speak to you about
[00:01:07.037 --> 00:01:08.538]  is the specifics of the attack.
[00:01:08.878 --> 00:01:13.122]  Firstly, because there's an investigation still ongoing.
[00:01:14.663 --> 00:01:18.225]  Secondly, because I don't need to put myself through that ordeal.
[00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:20.707]  It takes a lot out of me, and I don't like it.
[00:01:22.568 --> 00:01:33.036]  What I can talk to you about, however, and what I'm here to attempt to relate to you here today, is what it feels like to be unarmed when someone is coming to kill you.
[00:01:35.956 --> 00:01:37.457]  There's nothing like it in the world, folks.
[00:01:39.578 --> 00:01:43.300]  I wish that I could bottle some of that feeling for you.
[00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:52.125]  I wish I could let you taste a drop of the horror that is to write off the rest of your life in a few short seconds.
[00:01:54.407 --> 00:01:59.370]  To say to yourself, with every degree of certainty, this is it.
[00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.411]  I'm gonna die in here.
[00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:03.452]  Here it comes.
[00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:09.340]  But I can't make you feel that.
[00:02:12.062 --> 00:02:15.965]  Maybe some of you have, or will one day come as close as I did.
[00:02:17.286 --> 00:02:17.907]  Maybe you won't.
[00:02:18.487 --> 00:02:19.128]  It doesn't matter.
[00:02:19.148 --> 00:02:23.651]  After what I went through, I wish that on nobody.
[00:02:25.132 --> 00:02:28.054]  Because in a way, I did die in there.
[00:02:30.036 --> 00:02:36.221]  Major pieces of who I once was have been shot dead, buried, and are now dust.
[00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:44.894]  And after one becomes acquainted with that, certain environmental conditions become untenable.
[00:02:47.635 --> 00:02:59.740]  Among those conditions is the one in which I find myself unarmed before my attacker, and the one in which I must depend on another solely for my personal protection.
[00:03:01.621 --> 00:03:03.702]  Here, now, today,
[00:03:04.858 --> 00:03:12.119]  As a Texan, I find myself under those conditions because I'm unarmed by default.
[00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:15.160]  So are we all, unarmed by default.
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:33.303]  And I've heard it said that my experience holds no bearing on an argument for constitutional carry because in Texas we already enjoy the right
[00:03:34.744 --> 00:03:38.426]  To keep and bear arms through the state's concealed handgun licensing program.
[00:03:40.106 --> 00:03:43.308]  And if that's your thought, I ask you this.
[00:03:44.528 --> 00:03:47.350]  Do I have the right to keep breathing?
[00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:56.794]  Do I have the duty to preserve and protect that right for my wife and my two-year-old daughter?
[00:03:57.594 --> 00:04:03.897]  And does my family have the right to a father, a husband, and a son?
[00:04:06.047 --> 00:04:11.850]  And if I'm a man, if I'm a human being, then the answer is, of course, yes!
[00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.711]  God gave me that right.
[00:04:16.732 --> 00:04:20.633]  God gave me that duty long before there was a state of Texas.
[00:04:22.294 --> 00:04:23.315]  They are my birthright.
[00:04:24.755 --> 00:04:25.536]  They belong to me.
[00:04:28.537 --> 00:04:33.119]  What is it called when someone takes by force what is rightfully yours?
[00:04:34.773 --> 00:04:36.795]  And sells it back to you at a premium.
[00:04:39.377 --> 00:04:41.738]  You may call that a racket.
[00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.420]  You may call that a ransom.
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.961]  Extortion.
[00:04:46.682 --> 00:04:48.264]  Theft.
[00:04:49.625 --> 00:04:51.486]  You may call that a license.
[00:04:55.049 --> 00:04:55.589]  For over 100 years.
[00:04:58.123 --> 00:05:08.111]  The right of the people to keep and bear arms has been ignored by, admittedly, a well-meaning, but fatally misguided government.
[00:05:10.713 --> 00:05:24.184]  Which only in recent years, and even then, only after a major massacre at Luby's in Killeen in 1991, if you'll recall, have they been so generous as to allow us the privilege
[00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:26.519]  We're good to go.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:56.125]  is guaranteed because in order to remain free, a state requires a well-regulated militia.
[00:05:57.946 --> 00:06:00.368]  Not a well-regulated Department of Homeland Security.
[00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:04.791]  Not a well-regulated Department of Public Safety.
[00:06:05.552 --> 00:06:06.152]  A militia.
[00:06:06.873 --> 00:06:09.415]  Folks, you're the militia.
[00:06:12.177 --> 00:06:13.277]  It's your job.
[00:06:14.358 --> 00:06:15.359]  It's your birthright.
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:17.340]  Not theirs.
[00:06:23.584 --> 00:06:26.426]  License is not liberty.
[00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:30.970]  License is an abuse of liberty.
[00:06:33.512 --> 00:06:41.839]  Because by that strange duality of human nature we require deadly arms to preserve and protect life.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.424]  Is it any stretch at all to make the suggestion
[00:06:49.554 --> 00:06:57.098]  That requiring a license to keep and bear arms is an assault on the very right to life itself.
[00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:04.543]  After what I went through, I will give you that one for free.
[00:07:05.223 --> 00:07:07.064]  Yes, I do find it to be abusive.
[00:07:07.884 --> 00:07:16.689]  And yes, I find that pattern of abuse, that very long pattern of abuse by our government servants, to be unacceptable.
[00:07:22.697 --> 00:07:42.174]  And to the legislators, if you're listening to the people who are assembled before you today, the people who have worked so hard to put you underneath that big beautiful dome and who are proud to do it, we give you this mission.
[00:07:44.516 --> 00:07:49.321]  Starting today, you have the opportunity to reverse that long trend of abuse.
[00:07:53.078 --> 00:07:57.141]  It is your job, legislators, to make things right.
[00:07:59.103 --> 00:08:00.964]  It's our job to empower you.
[00:08:01.645 --> 00:08:03.186]  And empower you, we will.
[00:08:05.507 --> 00:08:08.570]  We will stand behind you every step of this journey.
[00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:15.275]  And Lord willing, should the need ever arise, we will even stand in front of you.
[00:08:18.601 --> 00:08:42.665]  And I will close by saying to everyone who came out today on a Tuesday, on a work day, I am deeply honored and humbled for the opportunity to stand here with you today, on my feet, like a Texan, and Lord willing, make a little bit of history with you.
[00:08:42.825 --> 00:08:45.046]  God bless each and every one of you.
[00:08:45.706 --> 00:08:46.586]  God bless Texas.
[00:08:47.568 --> 00:08:48.250]  Let's get this done.
[00:08:48.732 --> 00:08:49.736]  Thank you.
