[00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.560]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:25.724]  It is Monday, December 14, 2015, and I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:26.964]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.308 --> 00:00:38.633]  Tonight... A new poll shows that Americans are more concerned with terrorists than the struggling economy.
[00:00:39.594 --> 00:00:43.016]  Then, how climate shysters plan to get your money.
[00:00:44.498 --> 00:00:48.641]  After that, a gun advocate responds to a controversial demonstration
[00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:52.641]  And may the force of the pat-down be with you.
[00:00:53.363 --> 00:00:54.064]  That's next.
[00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:55.187]  It is.
[00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.423]  What I would do if I was space aliens here, masquerading as humans, if I wanted to kill humanity.
[00:01:00.603 --> 00:01:02.024]  I mean, that's it.
[00:01:02.224 --> 00:01:03.965]  I'm not saying it's space aliens, you know that.
[00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:25.820]  I'm just saying, if I was a robot computer analyzing this, I would say, alien intelligence, you know, crime analysis, masquerading as humans on surface of Earth, overthrow of civilization, cutting off energy supplies, stifling development, enslaving public, dumbing down population, attacking fertility rates, stifling space exploration for operation.
[00:01:30.222 --> 00:01:31.602]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:01:31.882 --> 00:01:33.163]  You can't survive without it.
[00:01:33.363 --> 00:01:34.283]  But where do you get it?
[00:01:34.563 --> 00:01:40.326]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:01:40.546 --> 00:01:46.268]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:01:46.468 --> 00:02:03.329]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:04.009]  We're good to go.
[00:02:33.237 --> 00:02:38.580]  Well, we're going to start the news out tonight with a small victory for the GMO labeling crowd.
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.943]  Now, this is one of the biggest food industry opponents to these labeling laws.
[00:02:43.303 --> 00:02:47.385]  They are preparing to roll out a non-GMO label.
[00:02:47.665 --> 00:02:52.148]  Tropicana Pure Premium juices will soon be marketed as GMO-free.
[00:02:52.608 --> 00:02:55.490]  Now, Tropicana's parent company is PepsiCo.
[00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.814]  PepsiCo has spent $9 million campaigning against state-level mandatory labeling laws.
[00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:13.283]  They also spent another $11 million lobbying for a federal bill that would preempt any local labeling laws and create a voluntary labeling program for GMO-free foods.
[00:03:13.883 --> 00:03:16.886]  So we reported on this and we knew that this was a big scam.
[00:03:17.106 --> 00:03:17.946]  What were they going to do?
[00:03:18.267 --> 00:03:20.909]  So here they're kind of putting this out at like, hey, look at us.
[00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.151]  We're going to go ahead and let you know.
[00:03:23.551 --> 00:03:26.914]  Voluntarily, we'll let you know which one of our products are GMO free.
[00:03:27.314 --> 00:03:41.406]  Meanwhile, Tropicana Premium Orange Juice has always claimed to be 100% pure Florida oranges and GMO oranges have not been introduced or approved for commercial production, although they are still kind of working on some.
[00:03:44.798 --> 00:03:51.022]  This is sort of a small victory because we see, you know, this labeling crowd has been pushing for this, but really this is a marketing ploy.
[00:03:51.042 --> 00:04:04.691]  They want people to say, you know, look how good this company is for what they're doing, but it's also getting consumers to buy a product at a higher price because it's seemingly safer and a more ethical product.
[00:04:05.131 --> 00:04:08.413]  So, my advice is to just go to the non-gmo-project.com.
[00:04:08.453 --> 00:04:12.976]  They have some resources there where you can find, you can take an app that you can take with you to the grocery store.
[00:04:13.316 --> 00:04:16.197]  You can find out which products have already been verified.
[00:04:16.678 --> 00:04:22.241]  And, you know, support those companies that have been pushing for non-GMO products from the get-go.
[00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:30.826]  Not these major corporations that are going to now try to tag along and they're just going to voluntarily do it so that you think that they are now ethical and the good guys.
[00:04:30.886 --> 00:04:34.088]  Meanwhile, they really need to just redo their entire product line.
[00:04:34.568 --> 00:04:40.431]  Now, here's another thing that, you know, we've reported on this a lot with autism and, you know, where does it come from?
[00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:45.294]  Obviously, scientists, they just have no idea why there's such a rise in autism.
[00:04:45.714 --> 00:04:52.557]  And, of course, they're not going to link it to vaccines, but it's interesting because now there's a new study that is linking autism to
[00:04:54.198 --> 00:04:56.580]  Pregnant women taking antidepressants.
[00:04:57.141 --> 00:05:01.785]  Now, specifically, they talk about Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, and their generics.
[00:05:02.146 --> 00:05:05.189]  These are some of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants.
[00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.411]  And now, U.S.
[00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:14.037]  research is suggesting that taking them during pregnancy may increase the chances that your child will have autism.
[00:05:14.798 --> 00:05:17.260]  And this study's authors say
[00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:32.278]  That woman who took a common class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during the second and third trimesters were more than twice as likely than other women to have children who later developed autism.
[00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:37.264]  So they also go on to recommend that women with mild to moderate depression
[00:05:37.805 --> 00:05:45.490]  May want to consider non-drug approaches such as therapy or exercise because these things have been shown to alleviate symptoms.
[00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.274]  And I know for myself personally, I went out and got a chihuahua on my doctor's recommendations.
[00:05:51.334 --> 00:05:53.636]  He said, that's going to help you with your depression.
[00:05:53.676 --> 00:05:57.298]  I got a dog and by golly, that little guy brought me so much joy.
[00:05:57.318 --> 00:06:07.265]  And I also changed around my diet and just made sure I was incorporating more dark berries, more nuts, things like that, that really go for that omega-3 for the brain.
[00:06:08.105 --> 00:06:20.154]  And really can help you with your depression so there are some natural alternatives out there and not these chemicals with these pharmaceuticals that are going to alter not only you physically, mentally, but also your unborn children.
[00:06:21.212 --> 00:06:30.579]  Now shifting gears here, we all know that one of the easiest ways to control the population and have them just conform to your agenda is with fear.
[00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:43.488]  And of course we are in a very important election cycle this 2016 coming up, so people should be worried about the shrinking middle class, but instead they are now worried about terrorism.
[00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:48.872]  Now Kurt Nimmo points out that you are more likely to be killed by lightning than a Twitter
[00:06:50.113 --> 00:06:50.273]  Yes.
[00:07:19.753 --> 00:07:20.693]  There's all this terror.
[00:07:20.733 --> 00:07:26.795]  We should be warned, be worried about extremists attacking the country, even though there are no credible threats.
[00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:33.518]  So, of course, people are now really concerned with terrorism, even though, you know, you are more likely to be struck by lightning.
[00:07:34.098 --> 00:07:38.740]  Now, it'll be interesting because tomorrow we're going to be covering the GOP debate live.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:48.103]  And here we have someone from American Enterprise Institute saying, let's hope CNN dedicates a meaningful amount of time in the Republican debate in Las Vegas.
[00:07:48.883 --> 00:07:50.664]  To the issue of terrorism.
[00:07:51.145 --> 00:07:57.569]  Voters deserve to hear how candidates plan to defeat Daesh and increase America's national security.
[00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.331]  So this is what they want people to focus on.
[00:08:00.491 --> 00:08:09.637]  This terror that really is probably not going to be a huge issue for us here in America, especially if we don't allow people in that aren't properly vetted.
[00:08:10.558 --> 00:08:10.818]  Right?
[00:08:11.218 --> 00:08:21.604]  But, you know, instead they want you to be focused on this like smoke and mirrors rather than asking the real questions or what are these candidates going to do to fix the economy, the shrinking middle class, taxes, loss of money.
[00:08:22.104 --> 00:08:28.888]  They don't want you to worry about the real issues and that happens every election cycle so they got to put up the big boogeyman so they can distract you with that.
[00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:31.069]  Now here's another article.
[00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:37.572]  A lot of people, one of the reasons why they're worried about terrorism reaching the United States is because of the vetting process.
[00:08:38.012 --> 00:08:41.594]  And particularly, they are furious with a secret U.S.
[00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:47.718]  policy that banned visa officials from looking at the terrorist wife's social media.
[00:08:48.118 --> 00:08:55.081]  So it turns out that Tashfeen Malik, she had three separate background checks performed and she passed all of them.
[00:08:55.161 --> 00:08:57.563]  She was able to get her fiancé visa.
[00:08:58.103 --> 00:09:11.168]  But meanwhile, according to FBI officials, she was making these social media posts, extensively posting to social media that, with her talk, included jihad and martyrdom.
[00:09:11.548 --> 00:09:16.470]  And so, of course, now they're pushing this out because they're saying, you know, look, our hands were tied.
[00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:21.833]  We couldn't go into that social media and just go in and determine, you know, how to vet these people.
[00:09:22.293 --> 00:09:27.395]  And so Homeland Security comes out and says, we want to use Facebook
[00:09:28.095 --> 00:09:29.557]  In our visa reviews.
[00:09:29.917 --> 00:09:36.585]  Now we have always reported how Facebook and other sites like this are just going to be these huge surveillance state tools.
[00:09:36.625 --> 00:09:41.911]  They're huge tools that help collate all of this data on everyone and one of the big concerns
[00:09:42.972 --> 00:09:50.578]  Complaints with the Obama administration has been that they cannot properly vet these refuges coming in and that is the whole mastering the human domain.
[00:09:50.878 --> 00:10:03.648]  They need to be able to master the entire human domain in all of these countries and of course Facebook has cast a very wide net and is in every country of the world pretty much other than I guess North Korea and Communist China.
[00:10:04.449 --> 00:10:07.512]  So now this is according to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:10:07.952 --> 00:10:15.479]  They're describing this this new Homeland Security order as part of a new focus on social media for this department.
[00:10:15.499 --> 00:10:19.943]  They've traditionally focused on legal records in the visa application process.
[00:10:20.623 --> 00:10:34.012]  And of course, you'll recall that in a speech immediately following this attack, President Obama urged high-tech and law enforcement leaders to make it harder for terrorists to use technology to escape from justice.
[00:10:34.192 --> 00:10:42.938]  And of course, that is going to be needing a lot more controls for the rest of us as well, because they hate us for our freedoms, so we need to give them up.
[00:10:43.458 --> 00:10:49.362]  And of course, this is why Americans are more afraid of terrorism than they're worried about the economy or something.
[00:10:51.183 --> 00:11:09.713]  I'm wondering if they're going to also now be having to dip into people's phones and their email and things like that because now the police there in Norway are raising the alarm because they have found hundreds of refugees caught with images of ISIS flags and severed heads on their phones.
[00:11:09.773 --> 00:11:15.316]  Now, these are refugees that are seeking asylum, crossing the border into Norway.
[00:11:16.096 --> 00:11:29.454]  And according to this report, they were searching their luggage and their cell phones and they logged hundreds of examples of photos and videos of executions and brutal punishments, such as images of people holding up severed heads or hands.
[00:11:29.854 --> 00:11:33.559]  Now they go on to say, oh, you know, those people could have had it on their phones innocently.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:40.682]  Of course, because I always download videos of severed heads to my phone and just hold it there for safekeeping.
[00:11:41.103 --> 00:11:54.528]  But of course, this is a huge concern, and I'm sure the technology that Obama is wanting to get into to help stop terrorism is going to now include mobile phones and things like that.
[00:11:55.268 --> 00:12:05.659]  Now let's take a look at this, because meanwhile, they say that all these people we should be worried about on the no-fly list, well if they're so dangerous, why are they still being allowed to just walk amongst us?
[00:12:06.039 --> 00:12:15.429]  And in fact, here in Paris, they have people who have been on the terror watch list, being actively investigated by the FBI, still working at the airport!
[00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:18.771]  We're working for the metro station, the bus station, and all of this.
[00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:20.612]  And now this report is coming out.
[00:12:21.232 --> 00:12:26.975]  70 Paris airport workers have had their security passes revoked over extremism fears.
[00:12:27.675 --> 00:12:35.460]  And the radicalization of airport personnel has sparked concern after the crash in October of that Russian jetliner in Egypt.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.183]  The officials believe that it was brought down by a bomb that was smuggled on board by an airport worker.
[00:12:41.923 --> 00:12:50.429]  Now 85,000 people have these secure zone clearances in these two airports around Charles de Gaulle and Orly.
[00:12:50.770 --> 00:13:00.337]  So 85,000 people, 70 Paris airport workers had their security clearance revoked because of radicalization fears.
[00:13:00.717 --> 00:13:07.039]  So these are people that they were concerned, you know, and here they are transporting your luggage because it's the people you never really even think about.
[00:13:07.079 --> 00:13:07.919]  It's the janitors.
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:16.422]  It's the people that are bringing your luggage down when you, oh, you didn't have enough room in the overhead bin and the guy takes your bag down and puts it under the plane.
[00:13:16.762 --> 00:13:18.903]  These are the guys that have the security clearance.
[00:13:19.183 --> 00:13:25.665]  And yeah, they have to get these background checks, three in fact, if they want to get into these really intense zones.
[00:13:26.085 --> 00:13:27.526]  But of course, you know,
[00:13:28.146 --> 00:13:28.466]  I don't know.
[00:13:37.788 --> 00:13:43.550]  Responsible for blowing himself up there and murdering all those people in the Bataclan Rock venue in Paris.
[00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:48.652]  He worked as a bus driver, but he was on an intelligence watch list.
[00:13:49.152 --> 00:13:50.773]  So this is another huge concern.
[00:13:50.793 --> 00:13:59.255]  Yeah, they're not only in the airports, but you know, they're at the bus, the metro, they're the railway employees, and you know, this is a huge issue.
[00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:00.176]  Meanwhile,
[00:14:00.996 --> 00:14:09.659]  People say we should be concerned about this, but on the other side we have Democrats proposing civil rights for illegals to enter the United States.
[00:14:09.719 --> 00:14:15.021]  That's why they want to say that it is a civil right to be able to come into the United States.
[00:14:15.081 --> 00:14:16.422]  Civil rights are for
[00:14:17.302 --> 00:14:17.742]  Americans.
[00:14:17.782 --> 00:14:20.663]  They're for people that are here, born here, make it here.
[00:14:21.284 --> 00:14:26.346]  And so now, this is in response to Donald Trump's proposal to ban Muslims entering the U.S.
[00:14:26.386 --> 00:14:27.366]  without being vetted.
[00:14:27.806 --> 00:14:32.729]  Senate Democrats are attempting to create a civil right for anyone to immigrate to the U.S.
[00:14:33.169 --> 00:14:34.789]  This is Senator Pat Leahy.
[00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:38.471]  He proposed an amendment to Title 18 of the U.S.
[00:14:38.551 --> 00:14:43.913]  Code to stop the federal government from banning individuals from entering into the U.S.
[00:14:44.173 --> 00:14:45.354]  based on their religion.
[00:14:45.754 --> 00:15:02.848]  So, you know, you see it's probably there with good intentions, but as I have mentioned here, there are some reasons to be concerned about bringing these people in without being properly vetted and giving them jobs in, you know, in these industries that a lot of Americans aren't willing to take.
[00:15:04.429 --> 00:15:05.170]  Let's go ahead.
[00:15:05.831 --> 00:15:08.613]  Coming up in this next segment, I'm going to be speaking with Michael Cargill.
[00:15:08.653 --> 00:15:10.775]  He's the founder of Central Texas Gunworks.
[00:15:11.196 --> 00:15:20.846]  And I wanted to bring him in today to give him the last word on this very incredible mock mass shooting drill that took place here in Austin, Texas this weekend.
[00:15:22.367 --> 00:15:26.852]  What I have to say is I'm going to fart in your face!
[00:15:29.651 --> 00:15:35.173]  I don't wanna talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough whopper!
[00:15:36.093 --> 00:15:38.334]  I fart in your gender direction!
[00:15:38.714 --> 00:15:43.615]  Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries!
[00:15:45.636 --> 00:15:48.116]  Is there someone else up there we could talk to?
[00:15:49.957 --> 00:15:51.357]  She is armed with reason.
[00:15:52.678 --> 00:15:53.278]  Armed with reason.
[00:15:54.301 --> 00:15:58.684]  So if there was an attack, farting and dildos are going to save you guys?
[00:16:03.106 --> 00:16:09.970]  Is this similar to like the Saul Alinsky fart-in where they would hold these mass fart-ins?
[00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:18.275]  When you come to my community, to the university that I love, and you threaten the lives of my friends,
[00:16:19.116 --> 00:16:21.336]  We fart in your general direction!
[00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:24.077]  We fart in your general direction!
[00:16:24.457 --> 00:16:27.037]  We fart in your general direction!
[00:16:27.157 --> 00:16:29.118]  I fart in your general direction!
[00:16:29.818 --> 00:16:31.698]  We fart in your general direction!
[00:16:32.218 --> 00:16:34.259]  We fart in your general direction!
[00:16:48.359 --> 00:16:54.061]  You are citizens that helped the off-duty sheriff take down the guy in the clock tower.
[00:16:55.282 --> 00:16:56.702]  I'm not answering any questions on that.
[00:16:56.742 --> 00:16:59.463]  That's the historical accuracy of that story.
[00:16:59.483 --> 00:17:02.945]  I will say, you know, I will say this, okay?
[00:17:03.505 --> 00:17:05.586]  It, you know, good job on that one, right?
[00:17:05.946 --> 00:17:06.206]  Great.
[00:17:06.646 --> 00:17:07.867]  This is not about the gun issue.
[00:17:08.187 --> 00:17:10.128]  This is about their protests, okay?
[00:17:10.448 --> 00:17:11.768]  I am a gun owner, okay?
[00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:14.970]  I shot my first pistol when I was three years old, okay?
[00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:17.931]  I have been trained in tactical handgun usage, okay?
[00:17:18.314 --> 00:17:20.115]  I know a little bit about guns, okay?
[00:17:20.375 --> 00:17:21.475]  This is not about that.
[00:17:21.855 --> 00:17:24.316]  This is about their tasteless protest, okay?
[00:17:24.356 --> 00:17:27.577]  This is about ratcheting up the rhetoric of fear.
[00:17:27.957 --> 00:17:30.457]  This is about terrorizing our community, okay?
[00:17:30.517 --> 00:17:31.478]  That's what this is about.
[00:17:32.198 --> 00:17:33.238]  You like guns, you don't like guns.
[00:17:33.278 --> 00:17:39.360]  If you go to their page, most of the people attacking them are other gun rights advocates who are saying, you're making us look bad, okay?
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:45.021]  So I think that it's time for somebody to stand up for a little bit of good taste, for a little bit of good humor, and to say, you know what?
[00:17:45.041 --> 00:17:47.442]  Let's just ratchet down the fear, okay?
[00:17:59.491 --> 00:18:02.057]  This is an American president.
[00:18:02.398 --> 00:18:03.540]  Just add puppet.
[00:18:03.921 --> 00:18:06.166]  Then vote and repeat every four years.
[00:18:16.311 --> 00:18:21.254]  Shane Steiner's involvement with InfoWarsLife.com truly happened in an organic way.
[00:18:21.374 --> 00:18:29.999]  I went to high school with Shane, his brother, knew his parents well, and he was visiting the office once, hadn't been to the office in years, and said, wow, I noticed you're making and selling supplements.
[00:18:30.019 --> 00:18:30.759]  Do these really work?
[00:18:30.799 --> 00:18:35.862]  Because I've tried a lot of supplements as a workout enthusiast, and I really think most of them are hype.
[00:18:35.902 --> 00:18:37.403]  And I said, here, take some home, try it.
[00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:44.048]  Well, a few weeks later, he came in, blown away, and said, I want to buy three boxes of this stuff to give my friends and family.
[00:18:44.468 --> 00:18:45.969]  It's simply amazing.
[00:18:46.009 --> 00:18:47.290]  He said, why does it work so well?
[00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:51.854]  And I said, listen, go to Infowarslife.com, watch the informational videos with Dr. Group and others.
[00:18:52.074 --> 00:18:53.575]  They understand how it all works.
[00:18:53.855 --> 00:18:55.436]  I know that it works for me.
[00:18:55.556 --> 00:18:56.697]  That's all I understand.
[00:18:56.957 --> 00:19:02.001]  The science, the facts, the research, people's testimonials, they're all on Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:02.021 --> 00:19:03.002]  You can check it out for yourself.
[00:19:03.602 --> 00:19:04.683]  I wanted to go to the gym.
[00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:14.788]  I wanted to push myself and work out harder, and that led to me being able to come out and do stuff like the barefooting and the surfing and stuff like that, which I would have never done.
[00:19:14.808 --> 00:19:17.329]  I never would have done that two years ago.
[00:19:17.929 --> 00:19:21.551]  Shane has said over and over again, more than just libido and energy,
[00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:23.873]  It made him want to get into the gym more.
[00:19:24.214 --> 00:19:25.675]  It made him want to get in better shape.
[00:19:25.715 --> 00:19:28.338]  And believe me, the Steiners have amazing genetics.
[00:19:28.879 --> 00:19:31.322]  His brother is a world champion steer wrestler.
[00:19:31.662 --> 00:19:35.647]  His dad, Bobby Steiner, is a famous world champion bull rider.
[00:19:35.847 --> 00:19:37.509]  They've got natural genetics.
[00:19:37.949 --> 00:19:42.675]  But when you added this to the mix, in Shane's own words, it took him to the next level.
[00:19:54.972 --> 00:19:56.673]  Shane noticed the mental clarity.
[00:19:57.134 --> 00:20:00.616]  Bobby was able to work out longer and gain muscle mass.
[00:20:00.736 --> 00:20:02.037]  He's already completely shredded.
[00:20:02.237 --> 00:20:04.899]  I gotta admit, for me, the biggest effect has been libido.
[00:20:05.259 --> 00:20:11.303]  Now, I've never claimed to have a body like some beach model, but back when I was 20, 22 years old and worked out every day, I looked great.
[00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:17.368]  But over the years and being married, having three kids, working 18 hours a day, I gained basically 100 pounds.
[00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:20.650]  And it's been a long process of losing that weight in the last four years.
[00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.392]  But if you look at the photos and the videos,
[00:20:23.752 --> 00:20:24.112]  We're good to go.
[00:20:42.837 --> 00:20:52.901]  This has actually made me feel so good that here lately, about a year ago, I started training jiu-jitsu and that kind of led to doing some boxing and kickboxing.
[00:20:52.921 --> 00:21:05.407]  I mean, it's amazing that two years ago I was on the couch and couldn't even tie my shoes and now I'm training with MMA fighters and just doing stuff that I never thought that I would be doing ever again.
[00:21:05.667 --> 00:21:07.528]  So, Supermail Vitality has
[00:21:08.408 --> 00:21:08.929]  I don't know.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.140]  You'll love it.
[00:22:03.071 --> 00:22:12.438]  Bottom line folks, you want to discover the power of super male vitality and super female vitality for yourself by visiting InfoWarsLife.com today or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:22.421]  Welcome back.
[00:22:22.641 --> 00:22:24.923]  Joining me now in studio is Michael Cargill.
[00:22:24.963 --> 00:22:38.454]  He's the founder of Central Texas Gunworks, and I wanted to get him in the studio because this weekend here in Austin, Texas, we sort of had a very controversial mock mass shooting that was set to take place on the University of Texas campus.
[00:22:39.215 --> 00:22:42.337]  It was met with a very large counter-protest.
[00:22:42.437 --> 00:22:49.523]  People weren't happy with the fact that they were going to be having this mock mass shooting on UT campus during finals week.
[00:22:50.804 --> 00:22:53.326]  Basically just saying these people were fear-mongering.
[00:22:54.286 --> 00:23:02.711]  But I wanted to get you in here, Michael, because you and others have been working tirelessly for years to get Campus Carry enacted.
[00:23:03.091 --> 00:23:05.192]  Of course, that's set to take effect in January 2016.
[00:23:05.252 --> 00:23:09.555]  What did you think about this mock mass shooting event?
[00:23:10.083 --> 00:23:21.949]  Yeah, I've actually been working, you know, with several groups on the University of Texas campus, also other groups around the state of Texas, other universities, the Texas A&M University, Texas Tech University.
[00:23:22.529 --> 00:23:28.792]  We've been working with Students for a Concealed Carry on campus, you know, all around the state of Texas trying to get campus carry pass.
[00:23:28.812 --> 00:23:29.772]  And we've been doing this since 2005.
[00:23:31.873 --> 00:23:33.255]  We've been in every single session.
[00:23:33.415 --> 00:23:40.304]  So we've been in session 2005, 2007, 2009, 2013, and 2015 trying to get campus carried past.
[00:23:41.105 --> 00:23:47.513]  And what bothers me are groups like this who come along who did nothing to help us.
[00:23:47.553 --> 00:23:48.975]  We needed people to go to the Capitol.
[00:23:49.815 --> 00:23:53.076]  To testify for some of these bills, these people were not present.
[00:23:53.156 --> 00:23:55.797]  We needed people to call our legislators, you know.
[00:23:56.457 --> 00:24:00.919]  We need people to hold up signs, you know, to get certain people elected into office in this state.
[00:24:01.179 --> 00:24:02.479]  None of these people were around.
[00:24:02.839 --> 00:24:06.300]  But now they come along, Campus Carry has already passed.
[00:24:06.801 --> 00:24:13.343]  The law is going into effect August the 1st, and now they're trying to give us a bad name by doing little silly and stupid stunts.
[00:24:13.563 --> 00:24:13.743]  Right.
[00:24:14.523 --> 00:24:22.887]  And so I know that if you saw the video that I posted over the weekend, I was never able to find this mock mass shooting.
[00:24:23.287 --> 00:24:35.353]  From what I understood with the police officers, as well as other media that was there, the group that was putting this on was being told to move to different areas because it kept being staged in places that were still on campus.
[00:24:35.813 --> 00:24:38.575]  UT said if they were on campus, they'd arrest them for trespassing.
[00:24:39.015 --> 00:24:41.056]  And so the media understood that they sort of got
[00:24:41.676 --> 00:24:42.017]  I think so.
[00:24:57.277 --> 00:25:03.959]  Someone who's actually coming along to cause harm isn't going to tell you when and where they're going to do it.
[00:25:04.359 --> 00:25:25.464]  So, you know, yes, great they made that point, but what ended up happening with all of the media that was there was that they're basically making fun of this group now, making a mockery of Campus Carry, turning this into a big joke and talking about how they were drowned out by farts by this other counter-protesting group who, of course, was there with their
[00:25:26.384 --> 00:25:28.726]  You know, very hilarious counter-protest.
[00:25:29.147 --> 00:25:35.492]  So now, Michael, you have a very personal passion with why you wanted to get Campus Carry passed.
[00:25:36.233 --> 00:25:41.458]  So tell us a little bit about this and why this sort of turning it into a joke upset you.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:49.764]  Well, you know, and let me be clear, you know, farting noises and things of this nature, using dildos, that's not going to save anyone's life.
[00:25:49.804 --> 00:25:49.905]  Right.
[00:25:49.925 --> 00:25:54.407]  You know, so these, you know, counter protesters weren't doing anything that's going to save lives.
[00:25:54.447 --> 00:25:57.389]  So I'm not, you know, helping the counter protesters at all.
[00:25:58.609 --> 00:26:00.410]  What these guys did was they made a big mistake.
[00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:07.394]  First of all, you don't do a protest at the University of Texas campus on the last day of finals when you have your
[00:26:08.995 --> 00:26:14.560]  The students are actually leaving to go home, and they have plenty of time to mount a counter-protest.
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:20.886]  They're happy, finals are over, so, oh, by the way, these guys are doing something on my campus I don't like, so let me go and counter-protest.
[00:26:21.266 --> 00:26:22.107]  It was very dumb.
[00:26:22.648 --> 00:26:25.971]  And then General Colin Powell said something to me that was really important.
[00:26:26.511 --> 00:26:28.733]  He said something about 10, 15 years ago.
[00:26:29.154 --> 00:26:34.759]  And he said that when he's doing a conflict, he uses the media to his advantage.
[00:26:35.419 --> 00:26:39.461]  And that is one thing that they failed to use the media to their advantage to get their point across.
[00:26:39.781 --> 00:26:41.021]  This was piss poor planning.
[00:26:41.461 --> 00:26:45.022]  You know, campus caring is something that's near and dear to my heart.
[00:26:45.523 --> 00:26:49.384]  My grandmother decided that at 70 years old she was going to go to college to get her college degree.
[00:26:49.744 --> 00:26:51.705]  My grandmother only got a high school education.
[00:26:52.085 --> 00:26:55.726]  At 70, she decided she wanted to become a nurse, so she went to college.
[00:26:56.146 --> 00:27:03.109]  While my grandmother was traveling from a college library, sitting at a bus stop waiting for a bus to come, a guy came along, mugged her, and raped her.
[00:27:03.857 --> 00:27:08.421]  And I side that point, I would make sure that every female in my family had tools they needed to protect themselves.
[00:27:08.821 --> 00:27:09.982]  So this is not a joke.
[00:27:10.382 --> 00:27:11.263]  This is not a joke for me.
[00:27:11.283 --> 00:27:15.546]  This is something I've been working for for over 10 years to get passed in this state.
[00:27:15.806 --> 00:27:27.135]  And I do not want clowns making a mockery of what we worked so hard for to get passed and we need a nice smooth transition because there are other things that we want to get passed in this session down the road.
[00:27:27.355 --> 00:27:28.395]  Right, exactly.
[00:27:28.475 --> 00:27:39.099]  And that was one of the things that you mentioned to me when I saw you Saturday, was just that, you know, this campus carry isn't about some kid in a classroom taking down a mass shooter.
[00:27:39.179 --> 00:27:46.461]  That's not what this was about because, A, they're not going to have the training necessary to take down a mass shooter, most likely.
[00:27:47.042 --> 00:27:48.162]  This is about self-defense.
[00:27:48.382 --> 00:27:50.143]  Yes, this is about my personal protection.
[00:27:50.163 --> 00:27:51.523]  This is about your personal protection.
[00:27:51.763 --> 00:27:53.503]  This is a license to carry a handgun.
[00:27:53.764 --> 00:27:58.185]  This is not about somebody being a one-armed security team trying to clear an entire building.
[00:27:58.245 --> 00:27:59.105]  This is not about that.
[00:27:59.425 --> 00:28:04.566]  This is about your individual personal protection and protection of your family and to protect yourself to stop someone from killing you.
[00:28:05.347 --> 00:28:06.507]  That is what this is all about.
[00:28:06.667 --> 00:28:09.848]  Not to be made a mockery of or anything else.
[00:28:10.751 --> 00:28:23.344]  And so I know we've seen some of these pro open carry groups sort of staging these events where they will carry their AR-15s and things like that into subway or whatever.
[00:28:25.206 --> 00:28:28.049]  What should people expect with campus carry?
[00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.932]  Are they going to be seeing these long guns in schools?
[00:28:31.772 --> 00:28:33.953]  And I also want to be clear on this point.
[00:28:34.173 --> 00:28:35.875]  I support, you know, open carry.
[00:28:36.175 --> 00:28:37.395]  I support concealed carry.
[00:28:37.756 --> 00:28:39.257]  I support constitutional carry.
[00:28:39.597 --> 00:28:42.018]  I think our Constitution, that is our right.
[00:28:42.318 --> 00:28:43.239]  That is our license.
[00:28:43.459 --> 00:28:45.941]  So we shouldn't have to pay the state any fee.
[00:28:46.201 --> 00:28:47.902]  So I want that to be nice and clear.
[00:28:47.922 --> 00:28:49.963]  You know, I'm all for the Constitution.
[00:28:50.023 --> 00:28:52.264]  I think that piece of paper there, that is my right.
[00:28:52.425 --> 00:28:53.145]  I like Vermont.
[00:28:53.185 --> 00:28:57.227]  In the state of Vermont, I don't need a license to carry my handgun concealed or openly.
[00:28:57.728 --> 00:28:59.229]  The Constitution is my license.
[00:28:59.369 --> 00:29:01.110]  And that is something that we need to move toward
[00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:02.771]  Here in the state of Texas.
[00:29:03.672 --> 00:29:11.699]  January the 1st, when open carry goes into effect for the state of Texas, we will become the 45th state to allow open carry in this state.
[00:29:12.199 --> 00:29:14.821]  There are 44 states currently that have open carry.
[00:29:14.942 --> 00:29:17.544]  Starting January the 1st, Texas will become the 45th state.
[00:29:18.044 --> 00:29:22.648]  So starting January the 1st, you will be able to open carry your handgun with a license to carry a handgun.
[00:29:23.008 --> 00:29:28.974]  The state of Texas is changing the program from a concealed handgun license to a license to carry a handgun.
[00:29:29.854 --> 00:29:31.555]  And with that, it will need to be a holster.
[00:29:31.955 --> 00:29:36.857]  It needs to be a holster that fits on your belt or a shoulder holster if you're going to open carry that handgun.
[00:29:37.377 --> 00:29:42.539]  And the way that's going to work is everywhere that you can conceal carry your handgun, you can open carry your handgun.
[00:29:43.099 --> 00:29:51.543]  So with the exception of a college campus, you will not be able to open carry that handgun on a college campus, not even on the streets, sidewalks, walkways, parking lots, or garages.
[00:29:52.099 --> 00:29:59.202]  Right, and so I think a lot of people are really concerned that they're going to have these guns in their face and that's going to make students very uncomfortable.
[00:29:59.582 --> 00:30:03.484]  The fact is, you're not going to know when someone has concealed carry.
[00:30:03.684 --> 00:30:08.266]  These people that have gone through training... Yes, they've gone through a four to six hour class.
[00:30:09.187 --> 00:30:16.930]  We've laid out the laws, you know, where you can and cannot carry that handgun, what you can and cannot do, the ramifications from that, if you do pull that gun out and use it.
[00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:21.932]  We've laid all this stuff out, taken them to the gun range, make sure they are proficient in the firearm.
[00:30:22.212 --> 00:30:25.053]  So we actually have a great program and our statistics go back to 1995.
[00:30:26.514 --> 00:30:28.834]  License holders are law-abiding citizens.
[00:30:29.074 --> 00:30:30.775]  They're not the ones that are committing crimes.
[00:30:31.255 --> 00:30:34.577]  License holders are actually more law-abiding than police officers.
[00:30:35.257 --> 00:30:38.658]  So when you get a license to carry a handgun here in the state of Texas... You have a lot more responsibility.
[00:30:38.818 --> 00:30:39.198]  Exactly.
[00:30:39.218 --> 00:30:40.679]  You don't have that license to kill.
[00:30:40.739 --> 00:30:46.561]  This is a great responsibility and with that, you know, with that license comes, you know, a great, great, great responsibility.
[00:30:46.641 --> 00:30:47.522]  Right, absolutely.
[00:30:47.962 --> 00:30:49.383]  And so now we got about a minute left.
[00:30:49.463 --> 00:30:51.044]  What do you want to say to some of these groups?
[00:30:51.124 --> 00:31:00.889]  Because I feel like every movement starts to experience a little bit of a splintering off between people have a different way that they want to see things go, different direction.
[00:31:00.909 --> 00:31:08.674]  And so you'll have groups kind of splinter off and then perhaps do things that don't necessarily look good for the whole Second Amendment movement.
[00:31:08.994 --> 00:31:09.755]  So what do you want to say?
[00:31:10.815 --> 00:31:12.436]  We need to remember the end game.
[00:31:12.476 --> 00:31:15.338]  The end game is to get constitutional carry passed in the state of Texas.
[00:31:15.718 --> 00:31:24.824]  We don't need to have little stunts that happened earlier this year in January, the Capitol, where someone stuck their foot in the state representative's office and that cost us constitutional carry in the state of Texas.
[00:31:25.144 --> 00:31:29.647]  Then, what the state reps did, they actually instituted panic buttons in the state rep's offices.
[00:31:29.947 --> 00:31:33.889]  And that killed Constitutional Carry for that entire session, and we almost lost other things.
[00:31:34.229 --> 00:31:36.050]  We don't need to have something like that happen.
[00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:39.272]  We need to show people that we are responsible gun owners in this state.
[00:31:39.532 --> 00:31:41.393]  We're responsible gun owners in this country.
[00:31:41.653 --> 00:31:43.054]  We are founded on firearms.
[00:31:43.434 --> 00:31:45.575]  And you're not going to take my firearm away from me.
[00:31:45.835 --> 00:31:46.216]  You know what?
[00:31:46.296 --> 00:31:49.137]  You knock on my door to take my gun, I'm going to give you my bullets first.
[00:31:49.437 --> 00:31:50.438]  That is what this is about.
[00:31:50.638 --> 00:31:52.719]  So let that be no mistake whatsoever.
[00:31:53.159 --> 00:31:54.260]  That is what we're talking about.
[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.360]  Wow, absolutely.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.201]  Alright, well Michael Cargill, thank you so much.
[00:31:57.321 --> 00:31:58.341]  Central Texas Gunworks.
[00:31:58.762 --> 00:32:04.744]  I'm glad that you were able to get in here and get the last word on this mock mass shooting that took place here in Austin, Texas.
[00:32:04.804 --> 00:32:06.984]  I'm sure you could see all the wonderful footage there.
[00:32:07.004 --> 00:32:11.486]  And now stick around because Jakari Jackson will be back, joining me in studio.
[00:32:27.142 --> 00:32:36.406]  You guys have the exclusive for which is a product called Deep Cleanse and why I'm so excited about it is it's a unique formula almost like the iodine crystals.
[00:32:36.506 --> 00:32:40.268]  We have two unique products that nobody in the world has.
[00:32:40.648 --> 00:32:52.434]  One of the most amazing ingredients in the world and it's called Shilajit and it's actually known as blood of the mountain or rock sweat because thousands of years ago, as a matter of fact, this ingredient
[00:32:52.634 --> 00:32:59.038]  Was only given to the elite of the elite thousands of years ago up in the Himalayan mountains and in Tibet.
[00:32:59.078 --> 00:33:02.901]  And we wanted to put this in stuff for a couple years, but we couldn't get an organic form.
[00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:03.301]  Right.
[00:33:03.401 --> 00:33:04.422]  I mean, let's explain.
[00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:07.624]  I mean, this stuff's so good, we couldn't put it out for years.
[00:33:07.904 --> 00:33:16.353]  Right, so I had to actually, it's kind of like the iodine crystals, finding a source deep in the earth that we could get the cleanest source available.
[00:33:16.793 --> 00:33:26.363]  But in Tibet and in Nepal and in the Himalayan mountains, thousands of years ago they found, they watched these monkeys and during the summer months the monkeys would go up into the mountains.
[00:33:26.384 --> 00:33:27.625]  Now you're being racist against monkeys.
[00:33:27.665 --> 00:33:28.306]  And they would pick
[00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:31.207]  This black substance from the mountains.
[00:33:31.668 --> 00:33:38.171]  And so in Russia, they actually, it grows in Russia and the mountains and in the Himalayas and only in the summer.
[00:33:38.272 --> 00:33:46.476]  And shilajit is actually the decomposition of up to 7,000 different medicinal herbs.
[00:33:46.536 --> 00:33:53.200]  So it decomposes, all these different herbs decompose in the Himalayan mountains and the volcanic soil up there.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.483]  And what happens in the summertime... So it's almost like an oil from
[00:33:58.343 --> 00:34:01.046]  Yes, it's high in fulvic acid, it's high in humic acid.
[00:34:01.086 --> 00:34:05.411]  Because they're always claiming oil is really from decomposed animals and plants.
[00:34:05.972 --> 00:34:10.417]  There is some oil that is based from fossils, but most of it's really abiotic.
[00:34:10.818 --> 00:34:14.823]  So this is a true fossil source?
[00:34:14.843 --> 00:34:15.583]  I mean, explain it to me.
[00:34:16.284 --> 00:34:16.624]  It is.
[00:34:17.024 --> 00:34:22.345]  It's really the decomposition, like I said, of over 7,000 different medicinal herbs and plants.
[00:34:22.505 --> 00:34:26.306]  And with the rocks and the pressure deep in the mountains, it freezes.
[00:34:26.386 --> 00:34:31.327]  And during the summertime and the pressures build it up, it oozes out.
[00:34:31.427 --> 00:34:33.007]  So it literally oozes out of the mountain.
[00:34:33.027 --> 00:34:33.827]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:34.187 --> 00:34:35.188]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:35.228 --> 00:34:38.348]  It's black and it's highly nutritious.
[00:34:39.188 --> 00:34:41.809]  Even in the 1980s, when the Olympic
[00:34:42.529 --> 00:34:44.850]  Athletes in Russia were accused of being on steroids.
[00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:52.231]  They found out that they were actually been given Shilajit because it works as an anabolic as well and it builds muscles.
[00:34:52.431 --> 00:34:53.491]  It's a big dose in there.
[00:34:53.511 --> 00:35:03.234]  The second big main ingredient in there is a volcanic zeolite concentrate and what this formula is designed to do, the Shilajit and the zeolites have a real strong negative charge.
[00:35:03.694 --> 00:35:08.615]  All the metals and chemicals and PCBs and VOCs have positive charges.
[00:35:09.415 --> 00:35:17.522]  So these go in, they grab it, and then they safely eliminate it through the body so you can become healthy.
[00:35:17.563 --> 00:35:21.506]  I mean, this is an amazing formula.
[00:35:21.646 --> 00:35:27.512]  I wish I actually had it, but because this was an exclusive InfoWars Life product, you're the only one in the world that has.
[00:35:28.132 --> 00:35:36.039]  This formula now and, you know, there is going to be a limited supply available when you sell out because you can only harvest this once a year.
[00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:37.260]  How do people take it?
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.622]  How is it recommended that this be done?
[00:35:39.722 --> 00:35:41.424]  Just a daily dose?
[00:35:41.704 --> 00:35:43.446]  Yeah, daily dose.
[00:35:43.526 --> 00:35:44.907]  The instructions are on the label.
[00:35:44.927 --> 00:35:48.330]  You know, of course, I kind of modify it for each individual.
[00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:49.931]  It depends on what your lifestyle is.
[00:35:49.971 --> 00:35:55.076]  I mean, honestly, the best thing to do is for you to avoid all these chemicals and toxins in your environment.
[00:35:55.376 --> 00:35:55.456]  Yeah.
[00:36:17.495 --> 00:36:18.396]  These aren't just great products.
[00:36:18.416 --> 00:36:20.199]  This is how we fund this independent operation.
[00:36:20.219 --> 00:36:25.426]  We're not taxpayer-funded like MSNBC or NPR, and neither is your local station, so support them, folks.
[00:36:25.627 --> 00:36:26.247]  This is a war.
[00:36:30.501 --> 00:36:37.687]  Joining me in studio now is David Knight, and we're going to be discussing this landmark climate agreement that was reached in Paris over the weekend.
[00:36:38.087 --> 00:36:44.272]  Now, this is a 31-page agreement, more than 100 countries signed on, pledging to curb climate change.
[00:36:44.732 --> 00:36:53.979]  Obama came out immediately touting American leadership in this process and saying, isn't it so great what can happen when countries actually work together?
[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:58.183]  Which was quite telling because, of course, the Secretary John Kerry came out afterward and said,
[00:36:58.723 --> 00:37:05.570]  We specifically wrote this avoiding having to deal with Congress because we knew Congress wouldn't agree on this.
[00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:07.732]  So there's a little telling there where sovereignty is headed.
[00:37:07.872 --> 00:37:16.180]  We've gotten mixed messages from the Obama administration, Lee, and what they said initially, Obama was saying, we have to have something that has teeth in it that can be enforced.
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:20.144]  And of course, one of the options in the original drafts of this agreement
[00:37:20.644 --> 00:37:21.164]  We're good to go.
[00:37:45.269 --> 00:37:48.050]  They're going to go down eventually to zero carbon.
[00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:49.410]  So we'll take a look at these numbers.
[00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:51.191]  But you know what this really is, Leanne?
[00:37:51.271 --> 00:37:54.372]  This is really economic death by degrees.
[00:37:54.892 --> 00:37:55.292]  Seriously.
[00:37:55.312 --> 00:38:02.854]  Because what they're doing with this and what we're going to talk about in just a moment, the French elections, these are all efforts at taking down economies, taking down national sovereignty,
[00:38:03.374 --> 00:38:10.380]  Creating chaos so that they can offer you the solution of a more centralized government as an intermediate step to a world government.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.303]  But let's take a quick look at the climate agreement, what it is and what it isn't.
[00:38:14.704 --> 00:38:17.946]  First of all, as I point out, they've got this goal of two degrees.
[00:38:17.986 --> 00:38:22.070]  Now they're doing that, that's two degrees centigrade, so it's about three and a half degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:25.433]  That is compared to pre-industrial levels.
[00:38:26.303 --> 00:38:31.768]  Ask yourself, where is the database of pre-industrial temperatures that is accurate?
[00:38:32.088 --> 00:38:43.919]  Because as Alex Jones interviewed the founder of the Weather Channel, he was saying, hey, you know, when I was younger, we had these thermometers that were mercury, you know, set on what he goes, you can't have that kind of accuracy.
[00:38:43.939 --> 00:38:52.667]  And of course, we know that depending on where you take the measurement, you have heat islands within cities, you have heat islands at airports where they frequently put the thermometers.
[00:38:53.447 --> 00:39:08.039]  As I pointed out on the radio yesterday, we would regularly see, as we drove from not a large city, Raleigh, North Carolina, to the exurbs where we lived, where it was forested, we would regularly see a three to five degree differential throughout the year, in terms of it being cooler.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:11.983]  We see that to a large degree here, even in Austin, as we live in the exurbs.
[00:39:12.263 --> 00:39:14.325]  So they're going to take this to pre-industrial levels.
[00:39:14.745 --> 00:39:16.707]  They have models that cannot be verified.
[00:39:16.747 --> 00:39:20.430]  That's why so many meteorologists do not buy this.
[00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:26.692]  Because they know they're working very hard on climate models so they can predict the weather two days in advance.
[00:39:26.752 --> 00:39:28.792]  And they're constantly tweaking these things because they're not there.
[00:39:29.132 --> 00:39:39.155]  But we're told that we're going to be able to predict this a century in advance, and according to these models, which cannot be verified, so they have to appeal to their authority in order to do this.
[00:39:39.495 --> 00:39:50.198]  Now the other part of this, the other big number in this, besides the two degrees and the one and a half degrees centigrade increase they're going to limit this to, it's going to be $100 billion a year of crony climatism.
[00:39:50.618 --> 00:39:56.281]  Transferring this money and that is a floor, they're very clear, that is a floor, it is not a ceiling.
[00:39:56.301 --> 00:40:08.327]  So you're going to see a massive increase of money being transferred out of Western countries as they use this as a means to try to shut down our income producing capabilities.
[00:40:08.347 --> 00:40:15.091]  They're going to be transferring our wealth and it's not going to be going to anybody but these fat cats who are the crony capitalists.
[00:40:15.111 --> 00:40:21.778]  They'll be setting up the new businesses in these third world countries that will be the recipients, of course, of this aid money.
[00:40:22.018 --> 00:40:30.607]  Yes, and you've already got Bill Gates and others that are setting up the structures to absorb all this massive transfer of wealth.
[00:40:30.828 --> 00:40:32.810]  Now Bernie Sanders, of course, is not impressed by this.
[00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:37.495]  He thinks that it goes nowhere near enough, and of course really he does have Bernie Sanders
[00:40:38.035 --> 00:40:54.784]  Really has the only solution to stopping this and it's called socialism because with that it can get us down not only to zero carbon but to a zero economy and so that's really where we're going but there is an interesting thing that came out of the out of the conference that was John Kerry's address where he had
[00:40:56.285 --> 00:40:59.307]  A very clearly stated what the real problem is here.
[00:40:59.447 --> 00:41:00.427]  And let me read that to you.
[00:41:00.808 --> 00:41:14.415]  He said to the conference, he says, the fact is that even if every single American citizen bike to work, carpool to school, use only solar panels to power their homes, if we planted a dozen trees, if we somehow eliminated all of our domestic greenhouse gas emissions, guess what?
[00:41:14.935 --> 00:41:18.577]  That still wouldn't be enough to offset the carbon pollution from the rest of the world.
[00:41:18.617 --> 00:41:28.763]  And he went on to say, if all the industrialized nations went down to zero emissions, remember what I said, all the industrialized nations went down to zero emissions, it wouldn't be enough.
[00:41:29.204 --> 00:41:32.946]  Not when more than 65% of the world's carbon pollution comes from the developing world.
[00:41:33.692 --> 00:41:40.396]  To which, one of the people that I've worked with in the past, Chris Warner, he's an author, he's argued cases before the Supreme Court.
[00:41:40.416 --> 00:41:45.559]  He says, what Kerry is doing is inadvertently pointing out that this is all pain, no gain.
[00:41:45.919 --> 00:41:55.044]  He won't admit to the pain, but he still says that if the state uses its coercive power, forces you into rationing energy, that it would somehow impact the climate.
[00:41:55.524 --> 00:41:58.486]  So, here's the good news though.
[00:41:58.506 --> 00:42:00.307]  It still wouldn't impact the climate.
[00:42:00.447 --> 00:42:00.847]  Exactly.
[00:42:00.947 --> 00:42:01.368]  So why not?
[00:42:01.628 --> 00:42:02.409]  So here's the good news.
[00:42:02.749 --> 00:42:06.352]  The International Climate Justice Tribunal was not put in place.
[00:42:06.392 --> 00:42:07.593]  So that's the best thing about it.
[00:42:08.033 --> 00:42:14.478]  And as they point out, Mitch McConnell and even Paul Ryan have said that this is going to be dead on arrival.
[00:42:15.118 --> 00:42:21.503]  Mitch McConnell said the US portion is relying on measures that are being championed by President Obama that were challenged in the courts.
[00:42:21.603 --> 00:42:27.188]  He says before his international partners pop the champagne, they should remember this is an unattainable deal.
[00:42:27.748 --> 00:42:36.650]  Based on a domestic energy plan that is likely illegal, that half of the states have sued to halt, that Congress has already voted to eject.
[00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:37.991]  And Paul Ryan echoed that.
[00:42:38.551 --> 00:42:39.671]  Of course, he's Speaker of the House.
[00:42:39.711 --> 00:42:42.112]  He says, this agreement does not bind Congress in any way.
[00:42:42.472 --> 00:42:47.153]  We will continue to focus on an energy policy that promotes America's abundant natural resources.
[00:42:47.213 --> 00:42:48.453]  So that's the good news.
[00:42:48.873 --> 00:42:50.894]  Now, here's where they're ultimately headed, Leigh Ann.
[00:42:51.414 --> 00:42:54.055]  They're talking now about a new space race.
[00:42:54.875 --> 00:43:02.777]  In terms of a crony capitalist competition to see who's going to create the satellite technology to monitor what's going on.
[00:43:02.817 --> 00:43:09.099]  Because that's, I think, one of the reasons why they didn't come up with an enforcement mechanism at this point is because they want to measure it.
[00:43:09.759 --> 00:43:14.080]  And that is going to allow them to pinpoint the sources of greenhouse gases.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:18.981]  And as we know with technology, they're going to take that down to the individual level for each and every one of us.
[00:43:19.221 --> 00:43:24.005]  And then, so what does this have to do with, you know, what's going on across the world with the refugee crisis?
[00:43:24.045 --> 00:43:27.908]  Because as we know, it's climate change that is causing this mass migration.
[00:43:28.068 --> 00:43:31.511]  Well, what we saw this weekend was very interesting because yesterday they had the French elections.
[00:43:31.691 --> 00:43:36.695]  A week earlier we had seen a surprise victory from the National Front in France.
[00:43:36.795 --> 00:43:40.457]  That was the people who were trying to stop immigration.
[00:43:41.198 --> 00:43:52.505]  What we saw yesterday was after the Socialists came in third in several areas, they completely removed their candidates and told the Socialists left to join with the Conservative Republicans.
[00:43:52.525 --> 00:43:54.306]  That's their name of their party.
[00:43:54.606 --> 00:43:59.009]  So the Conservative Republicans joined with the Socialists left, just as we see here in America.
[00:43:59.369 --> 00:44:05.854]  The establishment coming together to shut down anybody who would do anything about open and uncontrolled immigration.
[00:44:05.894 --> 00:44:07.756]  And of course they were able to defeat them.
[00:44:07.796 --> 00:44:16.522]  And again, Maureen Le Pen, who is head of the National Front, she was running as a candidate from Calais, where they're having that horrendous situation with refugees.
[00:44:16.582 --> 00:44:17.863]  So there was a lot of support for her.
[00:44:17.903 --> 00:44:21.506]  They won the first round in six out of 13 areas, but they didn't win there.
[00:44:21.566 --> 00:44:24.869]  Now what we saw as a reaction to that is Angela Merkel in Germany.
[00:44:25.569 --> 00:44:26.090]  We're good to go.
[00:44:45.303 --> 00:44:56.126]  And Angela Merkel in Germany, they're pushing this and what it's going to do is set up a border patrol that is going to keep the borders open even when the sovereign states don't want it.
[00:44:56.526 --> 00:45:03.528]  And as the Financial Times pointed out, this is the biggest transfer of national sovereignty to the European Union since the Euro.
[00:45:04.028 --> 00:45:09.011]  It's very important that people understand this is not about xenophobia, okay?
[00:45:09.051 --> 00:45:13.174]  They are trying to import chaos by bringing in jihadis, okay?
[00:45:13.574 --> 00:45:18.577]  But it is also about a massive transfer and consolidation of political power to the center.
[00:45:18.993 --> 00:45:19.213]  Right.
[00:45:19.293 --> 00:45:25.876]  And again, with Obama coming out and saying, you know, isn't it just amazing the things that we can accomplish when all of the countries work together?
[00:45:25.896 --> 00:45:31.658]  The minute that I saw that coming out of his mouth, it just, for me, I really felt like, wow, okay, here we go.
[00:45:31.678 --> 00:45:32.738]  This is the new world order.
[00:45:32.778 --> 00:45:33.418]  This is everyone.
[00:45:33.818 --> 00:45:38.020]  We don't need Congress's approval for this, even though, you know, of course there's no enforcement power.
[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:41.941]  But that's basically what he was saying, as well as John Kerry came out, echoed it as well.
[00:45:42.242 --> 00:45:43.142]  We don't need Congress.
[00:45:43.442 --> 00:45:45.523]  Well, Obama's going to try to run this through with the EPA.
[00:45:46.003 --> 00:45:51.186]  And even though this is just goals, we need to understand that UN agendas are very powerful.
[00:45:51.206 --> 00:46:06.854]  Our entire war on drugs, which is a huge tax on the economy, a huge drain on us, perverted our legal system, that all came from a UN agenda that was created 10 years before Nixon declared the war on drugs, and they followed it to the T, just like Agenda 21.
[00:46:07.554 --> 00:46:11.276]  So this is yet another UN agenda that they're going to push on us, and that's the concern.
[00:46:11.516 --> 00:46:12.457]  Wow, this is incredible.
[00:46:12.557 --> 00:46:14.480]  All right, David Knight, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:19.526]  All right, well stick around because Michael Cargill, the founder of Central Texas Gunworks, will be in studio.
[00:46:19.546 --> 00:46:26.956]  We're going to follow up on that mock mass shooting theatrical performance that took place here in Austin, Texas over the weekend.
[00:46:37.978 --> 00:46:38.980]  Brain Force is here.
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.804]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:46:42.084 --> 00:46:49.935]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:46:50.714 --> 00:46:54.295]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:46:54.335 --> 00:46:56.675]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:46:57.035 --> 00:47:00.576]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:00.616 --> 00:47:03.757]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:04.257 --> 00:47:09.058]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:09.598 --> 00:47:11.458]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:47:11.818 --> 00:47:16.239]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:16.419 --> 00:47:18.440]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.520]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:20.920]  Exactly.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.762]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:25.262 --> 00:47:33.306]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:47:38.197 --> 00:47:43.202]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:47:43.443 --> 00:47:49.549]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:47:49.749 --> 00:47:56.717]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:47:57.057 --> 00:48:07.003]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:07.563 --> 00:48:13.486]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:13.726 --> 00:48:16.408]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:17.128 --> 00:48:17.948]  Welcome back!
[00:48:17.968 --> 00:48:20.729]  Joining me in studio now is Jakari Jackson with the News Blitz.
[00:48:20.769 --> 00:48:21.929]  What's going on in the world today?
[00:48:46.107 --> 00:48:48.749]  We've got a lot of news going on today, Leigh Ann.
[00:48:48.889 --> 00:48:51.431]  Bergdahl, you know the story we've been talking about for a little while now.
[00:48:51.811 --> 00:48:56.134]  Now Bergdahl is to face desertion charges in a general court martial.
[00:48:56.254 --> 00:49:11.964]  Army Sergeant Bo Bergdahl, who was held by the Taliban for five years and freed in exchange for five detainees in Guantanamo Bay, will face charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy in a general court martial instead of a misdemeanor level form, the Army announced Monday.
[00:49:12.284 --> 00:49:15.126]  Now there's a lot of people that have weighed in on this topic.
[00:49:15.166 --> 00:49:15.747]  You know, I'm not a
[00:49:16.227 --> 00:49:30.694]  Military guy, so it doesn't really affect me as personally as it does some people, but some people saying the guy's a deserter You know he put his unit at risk not only for having them be a man down But then having to go out and search for him and of course I don't think anybody was happy that they changed that they exchanged five
[00:49:31.454 --> 00:49:32.054]  Detainees.
[00:49:32.354 --> 00:49:32.715]  Yeah.
[00:49:32.915 --> 00:49:33.795]  For this one guy.
[00:49:33.975 --> 00:49:41.298]  Former Al-Qaeda members who the Obama administration promised everyone they're changed men, they're not going to go back to terrorism.
[00:49:41.659 --> 00:49:49.362]  Then it turns out one of these guys has emerged as a top Al-Qaeda leader in a video urging Muslims to kill Americans.
[00:49:49.382 --> 00:49:51.343]  This is Ibrahim Al-Khosi.
[00:49:52.043 --> 00:49:54.144]  And he resurfaced in one of these videos.
[00:49:55.424 --> 00:49:56.985]  But, you know, these are others.
[00:49:57.185 --> 00:50:01.107]  The Obama administration also released bin Laden bodyguard.
[00:50:01.487 --> 00:50:08.890]  And their justification for this is that, you know, we're just gonna, we're gonna release the guys that are less threatening than those that we are fighting presently.
[00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:10.071]  Less threatening.
[00:50:10.511 --> 00:50:19.456]  But we also know, I think it came out last week, how they had a guy in Guantanamo Bay for a number of years who was actually a misidentification.
[00:50:19.817 --> 00:50:24.960]  They just got some wrong guy or they gave him the trumped up charge and he was there for several years before he got released.
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:32.807]  Yeah, and Obama has said that he wants to clear out Guantanamo Bay because it's basically a perfect recruitment ground for ISIS.
[00:50:33.288 --> 00:50:38.032]  So that's why he wants, but I mean, you know, you're torturing these guys for years and they're like, I promise you I'm a changed man.
[00:50:38.052 --> 00:50:41.355]  He's been saying he's going to shut it down for how many years now?
[00:50:41.395 --> 00:50:42.456]  Since before he got elected.
[00:50:42.476 --> 00:50:43.417]  Since before he got elected.
[00:50:43.437 --> 00:50:44.478]  That was his campaign promise.
[00:50:45.299 --> 00:50:47.280]  So we got some other things going on here.
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:53.281]  Earlier you were talking to Michael Cargill about some of the gun rights and the way things are being responded to.
[00:50:53.401 --> 00:50:58.843]  But somebody who had a perfect response, not to the thing that happened here at UT, but just guns in general, was Kurt Russell.
[00:50:59.163 --> 00:51:03.364]  And I know David Knight's been talking about this since last week, but I think it also deserves another mention.
[00:51:03.524 --> 00:51:03.804]  Oh yeah.
[00:51:03.824 --> 00:51:06.226]  Because so often we hear many negative things.
[00:51:06.246 --> 00:51:08.828]  You know, celebrities that come out, I hate guns, this and that.
[00:51:08.848 --> 00:51:13.631]  You know, we see the demand to plan things where these guys make millions of dollars off these violent movies or whatever else.
[00:51:14.132 --> 00:51:18.375]  But, you know, Kurt Russell has come out and he said, you know, we need to have guns in this country.
[00:51:18.395 --> 00:51:22.978]  And then he gets, he's talking to the guy who's trying to dupe him in, you know, saying something crazy or stupid.
[00:51:22.998 --> 00:51:23.759]  He's almost like shocked.
[00:51:23.799 --> 00:51:26.061]  Like, well, wait a minute, you're a Hollywood member.
[00:51:26.741 --> 00:51:31.622]  He's like, yeah, I mean, he's like, Kurt Russell, you live in a compound where you have, you know, armed security.
[00:51:31.662 --> 00:51:34.843]  And he was like, no, I want to be responsible for my own safety.
[00:51:34.883 --> 00:51:40.944]  And as he told the gentleman, Kurt Russell did, he said, hey, you can go to Home Depot and buy, you know, materials to make a bomb.
[00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:49.306]  It was on, I think they pull it off YouTube now, but a couple of years ago, a guy made a video going around the airport to airport gift shops and making weapons out of the stuff.
[00:51:49.386 --> 00:51:49.626]  Wow.
[00:51:50.066 --> 00:51:53.148]  But you know, you can't talk about just common sense stuff like that.
[00:51:53.168 --> 00:51:56.911]  They can get a knife, they can get a sledgehammer, they can drive a car into you.
[00:51:56.951 --> 00:51:58.732]  I mean, just take a look at what's going on in Israel.
[00:51:58.812 --> 00:52:05.196]  They're having stabbings every single day, multiple stabbings, or people are driving their cars into people using their cars.
[00:52:05.216 --> 00:52:07.337]  That happened here in South by Southwest.
[00:52:07.537 --> 00:52:08.517]  I went out there last year.
[00:52:08.757 --> 00:52:14.218]  The day after it happened, a guy got drunk or drove on the sidewalk, hit I think 20 people or so, several of whom died.
[00:52:14.478 --> 00:52:15.579]  Nobody wants to talk about that.
[00:52:16.539 --> 00:52:17.559]  It's an isolated incident.
[00:52:17.579 --> 00:52:19.480]  Well, 20 people got hit and many of them died.
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:21.780]  That's a pretty serious incident in my book.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.941]  So, you know, it was a very good response from Kurt Russell.
[00:52:25.521 --> 00:52:28.021]  Now, the Star Wars movie is coming up, Leigh-Anne.
[00:52:28.522 --> 00:52:38.243]  And I know you're just all the rage for it, but they have this new policy where they're not allowing people at certain theaters to come in, even with lightsabers.
[00:52:38.283 --> 00:52:40.264]  Because they say they have security concerns and all that.
[00:52:40.664 --> 00:52:46.405]  And I wouldn't support banning the Han Solo blaster, but to me that would make more sense than banning a lightsaber.
[00:52:46.745 --> 00:52:53.266]  But now we see that the LAPD is performing random stop and frisk searches on people going to the Star Wars premiere.
[00:52:53.826 --> 00:52:55.147]  We're good to go.
[00:53:13.062 --> 00:53:14.664]  If you're on the dark side or not.
[00:53:14.904 --> 00:53:16.706]  Because we've been saying this for years.
[00:53:17.286 --> 00:53:21.710]  Because they started doing the pat-downs and stuff when you go to the football games and all that stuff.
[00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:25.033]  Me and Josh had to go through a TSA style check when we went to the Super Bowl.
[00:53:25.353 --> 00:53:27.075]  And we were saying it's going to extend to shopping malls.
[00:53:27.135 --> 00:53:28.536]  It's going to extend to the movie theaters.
[00:53:28.917 --> 00:53:30.078]  And here it is, proof positive.
[00:53:30.478 --> 00:53:35.000]  Yeah, and it's not even just, like I said, it's not even just going to the movie theater if you happen to be in that area.
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:38.581]  The same thing when David Knight and I went to Philadelphia when the Pope was there.
[00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:40.322]  They shut down, you know, blocks.
[00:53:40.362 --> 00:53:44.144]  You know, we had to walk miles out of our way, you know, to get to our hotel at night.
[00:53:44.724 --> 00:53:48.506]  If you were walking down the street, you either had to walk all the way around or you had to be subject to a search.
[00:53:48.846 --> 00:53:50.206]  It happened in the United States of America.
[00:53:50.226 --> 00:53:52.227]  It's not some far-off sci-fi deal.
[00:53:52.287 --> 00:53:54.808]  It's happening right now, but people just don't care.
[00:53:54.828 --> 00:53:56.229]  It's like, well, you know, we'll
[00:53:58.191 --> 00:54:05.363]  Well, speaking of Star Wars, Jakari, I wanted to go ahead and play this clip from our favorite news pundit out there.
[00:54:05.704 --> 00:54:08.389]  Guys, go ahead and roll the clip of Melissa Harris-Perry.
[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:10.320]  You could?
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:11.201]  Really?
[00:54:40.004 --> 00:54:57.630]  Now Jakari, I have been hearing this for several months now leading up to this about Star Wars being racist because they didn't have any black characters originally and then now it turns out that they do have black characters so then you have people on the other side going well that's like reverse racism or whatever but I have never actually heard this argument.
[00:54:58.083 --> 00:55:00.685]  Well, I mean, you know, I'm not a huge Star Wars guy.
[00:55:00.725 --> 00:55:01.626]  Like, I have seen the movies.
[00:55:01.666 --> 00:55:03.707]  I'll see the new one, but I'm not a hardcore Star Wars guy.
[00:55:03.987 --> 00:55:06.249]  If you go back to the original trilogy, they had who?
[00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:09.311]  Billy Dee played Han Solo's friend or whatever.
[00:55:09.351 --> 00:55:10.792]  So they did have black people in.
[00:55:10.852 --> 00:55:12.493]  And then in the new trilogy, one of...
[00:55:13.766 --> 00:55:16.108]  Princess Leia's mom's bodyguards was black and all that stuff.
[00:55:16.528 --> 00:55:18.070]  But I mean, they have had black people in it.
[00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:25.136]  But to say that the movie is racist because Darth Vader was played by, or the voice of Darth Vader was played by James Earl Jones.
[00:55:25.176 --> 00:55:27.718]  I've actually seen interviews with James Earl Jones where he talked about it.
[00:55:28.098 --> 00:55:30.781]  And he said George Lucas came to him and wanted a voice that was dark.
[00:55:31.121 --> 00:55:33.803]  Not dark in color or race or anything.
[00:55:34.083 --> 00:55:47.514]  He said he was like a serious, like a serious intimidating tone because you can go back and watch like on a special disc DVDs or whatever making a Star Wars and you can hear the actual actor who's in the Darth Vader costume.
[00:55:47.534 --> 00:55:49.055]  He doesn't sound intimidating at all.
[00:55:49.335 --> 00:55:57.141]  So they're dubbing James Earl Jones to make the guy sound serious and scary but you know that's just I mean Melissa Ferry says so much stuff that I
[00:55:57.421 --> 00:56:19.631]  Yeah, well I mean these are the kind of things that get traction there because with this whole movement, people want to be able to argue about something and obviously Twitter, you have 150 characters, 180 characters to put your point across, so you can't really get in depth to really back up your claims or whatever you're saying, you can just put out that little soundbite and then it causes all this
[00:56:20.791 --> 00:56:24.834]  Yeah, I honestly think they just put this stuff out there to get a response from it.
[00:56:24.854 --> 00:56:26.915]  I don't think it's something that they're really passionate about.
[00:56:27.095 --> 00:56:28.856]  She said she can think about it all day long.
[00:56:28.996 --> 00:56:30.096]  Well, maybe she can.
[00:56:30.116 --> 00:56:32.198]  I'd turn anything into a racial issue.
[00:56:32.558 --> 00:56:39.402]  I mean, this is Hollywood where they have, you know, maybe I'm offended that they have, you know, actual humans voicing
[00:56:40.322 --> 00:56:42.063]  Penguins in cartoons and stuff.
[00:56:42.103 --> 00:56:42.483]  Yeah.
[00:56:42.723 --> 00:56:43.623]  I feel offended.
[00:56:43.663 --> 00:56:44.403]  Discrimination.
[00:56:45.364 --> 00:56:50.746]  I mean, at the end of the day, it's a movie about talking robots and aliens who hit each other with laser swords.
[00:56:50.906 --> 00:56:53.267]  You know, I mean, is it really that big of a deal?
[00:56:53.887 --> 00:56:55.888]  But here's a story that we should take seriously.
[00:56:56.008 --> 00:56:59.249]  Obama to expand modern day slavery with TPP.
[00:56:59.309 --> 00:57:07.011]  Now, if you recall, Leanne, if you have a trade agreement, you would think that that would be something to put sanctions on things like slave labor.
[00:57:07.051 --> 00:57:08.232]  But that is definitely not the case.
[00:57:08.712 --> 00:57:17.198]  It was Obama who quietly removed anti-slavery provisions from the TPP in June, while he was publicly attacking the Confederate flag as a symbol of slavery.
[00:57:17.718 --> 00:57:27.785]  The provision, which bars countries that engage in slavery from being part of the major trade deals with the U.S., was written by Senator Bob Mendez in the Huffington Post reported in May.
[00:57:28.405 --> 00:57:28.685]  I don't know.
[00:57:46.286 --> 00:57:54.375]  Yeah, yeah, we're taking steps to be more humanitarian by, you know, releasing people who we were torturing in prison camps and doing all these other horrific things to.
[00:57:54.916 --> 00:58:01.683]  And it's not just the people in the prison camps, you know, we see what happens here domestically, surveillance, police brutality, and so on and so forth.
[00:58:01.823 --> 00:58:06.747]  Well, this story, I think, could also just make people be a little bit more conscious of where their food comes from.
[00:58:06.808 --> 00:58:10.271]  Because I know a lot of people are concerned, obviously, with GMO labeling.
[00:58:10.731 --> 00:58:19.359]  But this is actually, they're telling you that if you get those bags of peeled shrimp or you go to the buffet with all-you-can-eat shrimp, it's already peeled.
[00:58:19.879 --> 00:58:21.480]  Who do you think peels that for you?
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:30.844]  And it turns out these are slave labor companies that are forcing people to work 16 hours a day and they've got their fingers in ice-cold water.
[00:58:31.445 --> 00:58:36.547]  So, yeah, I mean, it might just make you think a little bit about the convenience of the food we have here in the West.
[00:58:36.947 --> 00:58:41.289]  Well, Jakari Jackson, thank you so much for joining us and thank you for watching us tonight.

[00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:47.172]  Central with our live coverage of the GOP debate.
[00:58:48.831 --> 00:58:49.971]  Knockout is back.
[00:58:50.312 --> 00:59:01.415]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[00:59:01.816 --> 00:59:03.516]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:04.056 --> 00:59:13.140]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:15.320]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:15.881 --> 00:59:16.741]  It's the same price.
[00:59:17.481 --> 00:59:23.364]  As leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece, it has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult.
[00:59:23.904 --> 00:59:30.148]  It's got the GABA, so it would probably cost $50 to take all this as separate pills.
[00:59:30.648 --> 00:59:30.768]  It's $19.95.
[00:59:31.488 --> 00:59:33.830]  You take one or two of these,
[00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:38.213]  And it just is really clean restful sleep is what the reviews are.
[00:59:38.554 --> 00:59:42.477]  It's what I've experienced and it just synergistically puts everything in there.
