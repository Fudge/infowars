[00:00:02.318 --> 00:00:03.279]  The British are coming!
[00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:04.399]  The British are coming!
[00:00:06.821 --> 00:00:14.565]  Now the ride of Paul Revere set the nation on its ear, and the shock at Lexington heard round the world.
[00:00:15.986 --> 00:00:20.469]  When the British fired in the early dawn, the war of independence had begun.
[00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.611]  The die was cast, the rebel flag unfurled.
[00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:29.460]  And on to Concord, marched the foe, to seize the arsenal, there you know.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.781]  Waking folks, and searching all around.
[00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:41.883]  Till our militia stopped them in their tracks, at the old North Bridge, we turned them back, and chased those Redcoats back to Boston Town.
[00:00:43.323 --> 00:00:50.505]  And the shudder around the world, was the start of a revolution, the minute men were ready on the move.
[00:00:56.204 --> 00:01:08.075]  It happened that they had planned, if the British was ever to come over here, that they'd put a light up in this high church steeple.
[00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:10.197]  And Paul went down there to look.
[00:01:10.997 --> 00:01:14.601]  And sure enough, there was the light, burning brighter and day.
[00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.532]  Well, Paul, he jumped on his old horse and he lit out.
[00:01:18.952 --> 00:01:21.793]  He didn't know where he was going, but he knew he had to go somewhere.
[00:01:22.194 --> 00:01:23.374]  Oh, I wish you could have seen it.
[00:01:23.654 --> 00:01:28.737]  That old horse with his ears laid back and his nostrils wide open, sucking in wind like a jet engine.
[00:01:29.017 --> 00:01:32.039]  Feet pounding on them cobblestones, striking off sparks.
[00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:35.721]  Paul holding on for dear life and a hollering at the top of his lungs.
[00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:37.582]  He says, the British is coming!
[00:01:37.622 --> 00:01:38.622]  The British is coming!
[00:01:38.903 --> 00:01:41.364]  Get your gun, we gonna have us a revolution!
[00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.192]  And them farmers come a-piling out of the hay like bees out of a beehive.
[00:01:46.772 --> 00:01:47.973]  Minute men, they's called.
[00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:48.913]  What's minute men?
[00:01:49.393 --> 00:01:49.893]  Minute men?
[00:01:50.494 --> 00:01:52.614]  They's fellas that had to be ready at a minute's notice.
[00:01:52.935 --> 00:02:00.158]  And when Paul comes screeching down the road that way, they grab their guns and head out behind the weeds and walls and trees and everywhere.
[00:02:01.338 --> 00:02:07.041]  And when the British come pranks and all dressed up in their red suits, they let them have it.
[00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:09.922]  It was a sight to see.
[00:02:11.573 --> 00:02:12.593]  And then it happened.
[00:02:13.154 --> 00:02:14.074]  They fired the gun!
[00:02:14.814 --> 00:02:15.875]  They fired the gun.
[00:02:16.795 --> 00:02:21.917]  And the shot was so loud, it was heard clear around the world.
[00:02:22.938 --> 00:02:24.358]  Oh, get out.
[00:02:25.198 --> 00:02:25.799]  It's a fact.
[00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:27.719]  That's the way this country started.
