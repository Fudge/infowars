[00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:11.365]  I'm here at Camp Swift right outside of Bastrop, Texas, where starting July 15th through September 15th, with members of U.S.
[00:00:11.425 --> 00:00:19.351]  Army Special Operations Command and service members from the military's four branches, an exercise that has never been done will take place.
[00:00:19.611 --> 00:00:25.195]  Among some of the planned exercises will include soldiers moving undetected amongst the civilian population.
[00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:36.170]  Roy Boyd, Chief Deputy with the Victoria County Sheriff's Office, said they're going to set up cells of people and test how well they're able to move around without getting noticed in the community.
[00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.513]  Can't they already move around the community?
[00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.015]  They are Americans, right?
[00:00:40.275 --> 00:00:42.238]  The Third Amendment of the Bill of Rights states
[00:00:42.358 --> 00:00:51.489]  No soldier shall in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.
[00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:53.211]  Ambiguous under these conditions?
[00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:53.671]  Maybe.
[00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:59.478]  But how are we to know if they are soldiers if they are moving undetected, possibly into our homes?
[00:00:59.858 --> 00:01:18.276]  The Fourth Amendment states, "...the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, support by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized."
[00:01:18.596 --> 00:01:29.924]  There is more at play here as the Jade Helm playbook, Master the Human Domain, intends to collect information on who you are, what you do, who you know, and enter you into a demographic to be analyzed.
[00:01:30.224 --> 00:01:31.725]  Dissidents will be dealt with.
[00:01:31.926 --> 00:01:32.986]  Sound a little extreme?
[00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:39.411]  The 2006 US Military Police Training Manual targets civil disturbance operations within the United States
[00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:43.974]  And let's be clear, this is a blatant PSYOP, not a martial law takeover.
[00:01:57.162 --> 00:02:01.225]  We at Infowars are trying to make you aware of there's a big difference.
[00:02:01.546 --> 00:02:18.760]  The massive population of the US must first be conditioned before the next phase rolls out and the hostile areas according to Jade Helm must first be put in a chokehold by a corporatic government that can no longer and will no longer sustain the pursuit of happiness of its subjects.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.945]  Most people I spoke with were unaware and trusting of a government dominated by foreign banks and eroding trust.
[00:02:25.672 --> 00:02:29.955]  Well, I have a hunch that that may not be from Bigotry.
[00:02:29.995 --> 00:02:30.535]  Yeah?
[00:02:30.595 --> 00:02:41.523]  They may be trying to blend in, but they're... I still think it's military train.
[00:02:41.563 --> 00:02:42.043]  It's 12 o'clock.
[00:02:42.083 --> 00:02:44.284]  Does any of that ring, or is it not concerned?
[00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:44.905]  No.
[00:02:45.105 --> 00:02:45.365]  No.
[00:02:46.086 --> 00:02:51.589]  I mean, they can bring people in here and stuff, but if they're... I don't know.
[00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.831]  I am fine with the
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:55.180]  Yeah.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.282]  Full trust in the government?
[00:02:59.442 --> 00:02:59.762]  Yeah.
[00:03:00.182 --> 00:03:08.885]  I may not agree with everything that the governor does, but I appreciate... The new one?
[00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:09.145]  Either one.
[00:03:09.185 --> 00:03:10.946]  Terry or Abbott.
[00:03:11.386 --> 00:03:11.566]  Yeah.
[00:03:12.226 --> 00:03:21.673]  But I appreciate them standing up for Texans and their rights, because unfortunately too many people don't realize about the 9th and 10th Amendment.
[00:03:22.013 --> 00:03:23.914]  You know the history of the war and how it really started?
[00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:29.598]  With the shooting of the boat out in the... It was wrong from the beginning.
[00:03:29.618 --> 00:03:30.739]  You know?
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.343]  All the wars since then have been for something not about protecting people in our country.
[00:03:36.924 --> 00:03:38.024]  There's nobody invading us.
[00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:42.527]  It's about money and oil and stuff like that.
[00:03:42.547 --> 00:03:43.268]  I don't know.
[00:03:43.308 --> 00:03:46.850]  The industrial military complex has gotten way out of hand to me.
[00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:48.591]  I was in the Air State a long time ago.
[00:03:49.032 --> 00:03:56.837]  The councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought.
[00:03:57.526 --> 00:04:04.915]  By the military-industrial complex, we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic process.
[00:04:04.956 --> 00:04:09.001]  From Camp Swift in Bastrop, Texas, I'm John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[00:04:16.294 --> 00:04:23.456]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:04:23.556 --> 00:04:25.736]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:04:25.916 --> 00:04:31.118]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:04:31.278 --> 00:04:36.359]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:39.621]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:43.823]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew link to numerous conditions.
[00:04:44.043 --> 00:04:48.346]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:04:48.426 --> 00:04:58.571]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:04:58.791 --> 00:05:01.333]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[00:05:01.653 --> 00:05:09.697]  Manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
