[00:00:15.043 --> 00:00:20.706]  Stuffed shirt political Yahoo writer Matt Bayh has declared that Biden should run.
[00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:21.607]  Now.
[00:00:22.187 --> 00:00:26.289]  Because it's the only way to know what Hillary is willing to risk.
[00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.211]  I don't feel no ways tired.
[00:00:29.231 --> 00:00:34.994]  I've come too far from where I started from.
[00:00:35.575 --> 00:00:39.017]  Nobody told me that the road would be easy.
[00:00:39.895 --> 00:00:45.899]  Mr. Bayh, Hillary is willing to risk everything she already has.
[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.483]  Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate, Chinagate, Benghazi.
[00:00:52.503 --> 00:00:54.544]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:00:54.584 --> 00:00:55.505]  Self-respect.
[00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:59.447]  I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
[00:01:00.028 --> 00:01:08.033]  Bayh begins his ivory tower indoctrination with his full frontal assault on the stupidity of the slumbering masses of American voters.
[00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:15.902]  It's doubtful that many voters care as much about Hillary Clinton's State Department emails as reporters do.
[00:01:16.383 --> 00:01:22.951]  They're probably not too wound up over the foreign contributions flowing into her family foundation, either.
[00:01:23.412 --> 00:01:26.136]  Mr. Bai, voters are concerned.
[00:01:26.616 --> 00:01:31.878]  The Quinnipiac Poll isn't going to tell you anything when she is the only candidate.
[00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:39.200]  Just take a gander at any of the 8,038 angry comments responding to your elitist swill of an article.
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.582]  Since there are so many, here is one from 22 minutes ago.
[00:01:43.982 --> 00:01:46.823]  John writes, Illegal email accounts
[00:01:47.603 --> 00:01:48.743]  Illegal fundraising.
[00:01:49.323 --> 00:01:51.024]  Why should we care about that?
[00:01:51.404 --> 00:01:54.784]  It's only nitpicky reporters pointing out the transgressions.
[00:01:54.885 --> 00:01:59.225]  I mean, we have a current president that uses the Constitution as toilet paper.
[00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:03.946]  So why should we expect any presidential candidates to follow the law?
[00:02:04.306 --> 00:02:08.427]  I need to remind you that we are talking about Democrat candidates.
[00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:16.729]  Republicans can be vilified for 30-year-old supposedly unpaid parking tickets or for knowing a guy who knows a guy that knows a guy that is off-color.
[00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.554]  Matt Bayh's byline should read, DNC hack.
[00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:22.938]  But enough about the comments in Hillary.
[00:02:23.278 --> 00:02:27.965]  Let's get down to anointing his supreme eminence, Vice President Joe Biden.
[00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.231]  The creepy, plagiarizing liar hovering over what's left of our Bill of Rights.
[00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:52.134]  Mr. Bi continues, Biden has a well-known tendency to get caught up in the moment and say things that are impolitic or even partly untrue, which in Washington tends to make you a figure of ridicule.
[00:02:52.354 --> 00:02:55.915]  Though in most other places, it's known as having a pulse.
[00:02:56.215 --> 00:03:00.476]  But this standard is not a measure of how we can evaluate the condition of our society.
[00:03:01.801 --> 00:03:06.255]  It cannot measure the health of our children, the quality of our education.
[00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:08.505]  The joy of their play.
[00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:12.046]  This is how it sounded when Robert Kennedy said those words in 1968.
[00:03:12.187 --> 00:03:21.289]  If the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education, or the joy of their play.
[00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:22.269]  There was more.
[00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:28.611]  A videotape caught Biden at a neighborhood coffee in New Hampshire making exaggerated claims about his college record.
[00:03:28.851 --> 00:03:32.492]  Went back to law school and in fact ended up in the top half of my class.
[00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:34.633]  In fact, as Biden finally confessed
[00:03:37.475 --> 00:03:40.358]  Mr. Bayh, what other places?
[00:03:40.818 --> 00:03:44.281]  Hell, shouldn't that statement be the other way around?
[00:03:44.742 --> 00:03:51.608]  Biden once claimed almost exactly what Brian Williams is sitting at home drinking beers on his lonesome couch for.
[00:03:52.088 --> 00:03:52.928]  By continues.
[00:03:53.348 --> 00:04:01.470]  Biden's a middle-class champion who makes the case for economic fairness with more conviction than Clinton and less vitriol than Warren.
[00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:09.292]  He's a serious thinker on foreign policy who opposes rampant interventionism without sounding like a pacifist.
[00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:17.214]  How they can justify raising taxes on the middle class that's been buried the last four years.
[00:04:18.055 --> 00:04:19.395]  How in Lord's name
[00:04:20.046 --> 00:04:23.272]  Can they justify raising their taxes with these tax cuts?
[00:04:23.332 --> 00:04:30.464]  Vice President Biden just today said that the middle class over the last four years has been quote, buried.
[00:04:31.867 --> 00:04:32.387]  We agree.
[00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.231]  I'm in it to win it!
[00:04:35.251 --> 00:04:38.172]  He's earned the right to stand in something else.
[00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:58.480]  In time, democracy can be delivered to the Ukrainian people.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.102]  Joe Biden's son accepted a position with a Ukrainian gas company as a private citizen.
[00:05:05.323 --> 00:05:07.563]  And his dad does not endorse it.
[00:05:07.623 --> 00:05:13.285]  I mean, this is just so outrageous that the globalists are involved overthrowing Ukraine.
[00:05:14.086 --> 00:05:19.047]  And then they would put his son in as one of the top executives to rake in just unbelievable amounts of money.
[00:05:20.308 --> 00:05:23.029]  And then they criticize Putin for being involved in the government investments.
[00:05:23.049 --> 00:05:24.049]  Yeah, it's wrong.
[00:05:25.925 --> 00:05:34.134]  And it's just openly done and now we just accept the governing class will own the state controlled blocks and make billions of dollars and just laugh at us.
[00:05:35.215 --> 00:05:38.338]  That's not an economy based on products or on innovation.
[00:05:38.378 --> 00:05:40.801]  It's based on Joe Biden's smiley face son.
[00:05:40.821 --> 00:05:42.843]  I mean, I look at him and he makes me sick.
[00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:47.280]  And communism doesn't exist, folks.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:53.764]  It's just a thug system where you tell the general public, oh, you're going to share all the things and we're going to get the rich people.
[00:05:54.084 --> 00:05:59.467]  And they go rob the nouveau riche, they go rob the real producers, who I'm sure aren't perfect in most countries.
[00:06:00.933 --> 00:06:02.914]  And they replace it with something a hundred times worse.
[00:06:03.294 --> 00:06:11.416]  The 2016 presidential election is shambling down the old spy grid, inebriated on false promises that deliver high premiums.
[00:06:11.796 --> 00:06:22.699]  Meanwhile, President Two-Face has crowned his cranium with his pen, phone, and our tax dollars as China and Russia ditch the dollar our grandparents fought to make almighty.
[00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:24.660]  America is on life support.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.201]  We need a real American to stand up and take the reins.
[00:06:28.741 --> 00:06:31.481]  Give me another good reason why you shouldn't run.
[00:06:31.862 --> 00:06:32.282]  I can't.
[00:06:34.262 --> 00:06:34.462]  Yeah?
[00:06:35.262 --> 00:06:41.743]  There may be reasons I don't run, but there's no obvious reason for me why I think I should not run.
[00:06:43.464 --> 00:06:44.524]  Run, Forrest!
[00:06:45.284 --> 00:06:45.504]  Run!
[00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:54.665]  John Barrow for Infowars.com We know we're under attack!
[00:06:54.825 --> 00:06:58.106]  Look at that light!
[00:07:00.902 --> 00:07:08.745]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:07:09.025 --> 00:07:11.085]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:07:11.245 --> 00:07:13.886]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:07:13.946 --> 00:07:18.048]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment, and pushes Obamacare.
[00:07:18.368 --> 00:07:21.529]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:07:21.549 --> 00:07:28.791]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:33.115]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:07:33.295 --> 00:07:34.956]  We are the true media.
[00:07:35.097 --> 00:07:37.719]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:41.482]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
