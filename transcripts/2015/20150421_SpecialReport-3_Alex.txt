[00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:12.314]  The following program was overseen by certified professionals.
[00:00:12.835 --> 00:00:14.197]  Do not try these stunts at home.
[00:00:14.778 --> 00:00:16.200]  Self-defense starts with safety.
[00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:21.488]  It is essential that before using a firearm that you seek and receive professional training.
[00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:35.644]  The Department of Homeland Security is set to purchase over 62 million rounds of ammo, typically used in AR-15 semi-automatic rifles, just weeks after the ATF was forced to back down on a ban on M855 bullets.
[00:00:35.664 --> 00:00:47.448]  The firearms that could be classified as pistols being able to use not just this M885 round, but any 5.56 round, it's a challenge for officer safety, public safety.
[00:00:47.668 --> 00:01:03.275]  A posting on fedbizops.gov this week reveals that the DHS is looking to contract with the company to provide 12.6 million rounds of .223 Remington ammunition per year for a period of five years, totaling 62.5 million bullets.
[00:01:03.735 --> 00:01:10.738]  The solicitation explains that the purchase is intended to achieve price savings over the current .223 Rem duty ammunition.
[00:01:11.178 --> 00:01:12.399]  The bullets will be used by U.S.
[00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:17.583]  Customs and Border Protection agents nationwide for training purposes.
[00:01:17.923 --> 00:01:22.647]  Meanwhile, pre-Jade Helm, military drills are popping up nationwide.
[00:01:22.727 --> 00:01:25.709]  The Desert Dispatch reports on the training in Southern California.
[00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.350]  U.S.
[00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:35.757]  Marines from the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit from Camp Pendleton conducted a non-combatant evacuation operation training exercise at Robert A. Sessions Memorial Sports Park.
[00:01:36.297 --> 00:01:47.030]  During the certified exercise, the unit was required to conduct a series of challenging and realistic training events to test their ability to conduct conventional and specialized missions.
[00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:51.176]  News 13 Now out of Des Moines, Iowa, Nonchalantly reports.
[00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:00.754]  Well this week you may notice extra emergency vehicles and public safety officers running around the community in tactical gear, hazmat suits and bomb suits.
[00:02:00.834 --> 00:02:03.896]  This is all part of a statewide drill Des Moines is hosting.
[00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:09.979]  Bomb technicians, law enforcement and Iowa Homeland Security personnel will all be here working on this.
[00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:21.366]  They know how they're part of the large picture, and so when they're sharing information, they're getting the response and they know that those skills are being utilized to the best of their ability.
[00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:30.892]  In Arizona, Prescott News lackadaisically reports, if you see some unusual helicopters overhead in the next couple of days, there's nothing to worry about.
[00:02:31.392 --> 00:02:44.479]  Marine Expeditionary Force G7 will be conducting a realistic military training this week using the Prescott Municipal Airfield as a helicopter refueling point in order to facilitate a long-range raid at Camp Navajo, Arizona.
[00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:54.004]  The certification exercise is directed to be conducted from April 8th through the 21st, 2015 at various training locations through California and Arizona.
[00:02:54.244 --> 00:02:56.105]  Something large is looming in 2015.
[00:02:57.566 --> 00:03:00.968]  ISIS on our borders, but mainstream media won't acknowledge it.
[00:03:01.108 --> 00:03:05.030]  Terror cells quietly training within the United States for decades.
[00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.011]  Patriotic Americans deem the number one terror threat.
[00:03:07.051 --> 00:03:09.512]  It doesn't take a conspiracy theorist to realize that 2 plus 2 does not equal 5.
[00:03:09.552 --> 00:03:10.272]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.103]  We don't want another attack!
[00:03:34.143 --> 00:03:35.485]  Look at that one!
[00:03:35.525 --> 00:03:36.727]  We're blocking their position!
[00:03:38.956 --> 00:03:46.819]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.140]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.942]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:56.123]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment, and pushes Obamacare.
[00:03:56.423 --> 00:03:59.585]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:06.868]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:04:07.048 --> 00:04:11.192]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:04:11.372 --> 00:04:13.013]  We are the true media.
[00:04:13.174 --> 00:04:15.776]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:04:15.876 --> 00:04:19.539]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
