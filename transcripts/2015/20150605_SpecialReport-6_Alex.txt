[00:00:12.948 --> 00:00:18.071]  Our universe might be a Matrix-like computer game designed by aliens.
[00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:28.097]  Now, this was a theory that was first proposed by a British philosopher, Nick Bostrom, just a few years after the Matrix film was released.
[00:00:28.457 --> 00:00:31.118]  So, of course he could have been influenced by the film, who knows.
[00:00:31.678 --> 00:00:39.380]  But in his paper, Dr. Bostrom suggests that a race of far-evolved descendants could be behind our digital imprisonment.
[00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:47.323]  These futuristic beings, whether they be human or otherwise, could be using virtual reality to stimulate a time in the past
[00:00:47.843 --> 00:00:51.046]  Or trying to recreate how their remote ancestors lived.
[00:00:51.507 --> 00:00:56.431]  So, I know that might sound crazy, but NASA actually thinks that he could be right.
[00:00:56.992 --> 00:00:58.874]  Now, this is according to Rich Terrell.
[00:00:59.014 --> 00:01:06.201]  He is the director of the Center for Evolutionary Computation and Automated Design at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
[00:01:06.581 --> 00:01:12.327]  He says that in quantum mechanics, particles do not have a definite state unless they're being observed.
[00:01:12.987 --> 00:01:18.876]  One explanation is that we're living within a simulation seeing what we need to see when we need to see it.
[00:01:19.256 --> 00:01:28.290]  And he said he still finds it inspiring that even if we are living in some sort of a simulation or many orders of magnitude down in levels of simulation,
[00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:36.692]  Somewhere along the way something escaped the primordial ooze to become us and to result in simulations that made us.
[00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:39.032]  And so he thinks that that's cool.
[00:01:39.693 --> 00:01:43.853]  Well I don't want to go into too deep of what that might possibly be.
[00:01:44.214 --> 00:01:50.335]  David Icke was actually on the Alex Jones Show and talked a little bit about what might be behind this digital enslavement.
[00:01:51.075 --> 00:01:54.696]  But if you think that virtual reality and living in a simulation
[00:01:55.356 --> 00:01:55.676]  I think?
[00:02:14.315 --> 00:02:26.343]  And PBS Nova says, with the entire internet and thousands of databases for a brain, the device will be able to respond almost instantaneously to complex questions posed by intelligence analysts.
[00:02:26.944 --> 00:02:42.214]  As more and more data is collected through phone calls, credit card receipts, social media, GPS trackers, cell phone geolocation, internet searches, Amazon book purchases, and even E-ZPass toll records, it may one day be possible to know
[00:02:42.674 --> 00:02:47.498]  Not just where people are and what they are doing, but what and how they think.
[00:02:48.438 --> 00:02:49.759]  So this was many years ago.
[00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.340]  PBS Nova.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.102]  They're not huge conspiracy theorists.
[00:02:53.462 --> 00:02:54.242]  But think back then, 2009.
[00:02:55.623 --> 00:03:00.067]  Smart homes and smart tracking apps weren't as prevalent as they are today.
[00:03:00.127 --> 00:03:04.170]  So all of this technology were basically helping to build our own digital imprisonment.
[00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:13.399]  But another AI program, Sentient World Simulation, this was proposed in 2006 and has largely flown under the radar.
[00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.164]  Sentient World Simulation is a matrix-like reality simulating humanity.
[00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:27.914]  It is a mirror model of the real world running in parallel on a computer and it's designed to predict and evaluate future events and courses of action.
[00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:34.818]  SWS provides an environment for testing psychological operations and civil affairs activities.
[00:03:35.218 --> 00:03:39.240]  It's capable of illustrating the impact of these activities on populations.
[00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:48.346]  So in a parallel world, the Pentagon is running an AI program to see how people will react to propaganda and government-inflicted terror.
[00:03:48.826 --> 00:03:56.073]  So they can yank a country's water supply or stage a military coup and see how people are going to react.
[00:03:56.314 --> 00:04:06.484]  Now the military through all this is seeking to gain full spectrum picture of the everyday reality of people's lives and of course the adversaries of the military.
[00:04:06.864 --> 00:04:11.469]  So that's why they're tracking protesters and vegan potlucks and
[00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:22.675]  The Occupy protests and things like that because they're wanting to see not only who are terrorists, but people who are actively trying to maybe overthrow the world order.
[00:04:23.255 --> 00:04:26.157]  So with this upcoming Jade Helm, is this just a drill?
[00:04:26.978 --> 00:04:31.280]  Will soldiers be in place to test the simulation capabilities?
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.702]  Are they wargaming some potential humanitarian emergency scenarios?
[00:04:36.363 --> 00:04:38.064]  You know, responding to civil unrest?
[00:04:38.604 --> 00:04:40.805]  We did report last year how the U.S.
[00:04:40.825 --> 00:04:48.507]  Department of Defense put out a FedBizOp request for an even more game-changing technology to predict societal unrest.
[00:04:48.887 --> 00:04:56.430]  They were looking to find some technology that would help them to track all human activities that can be measured.
[00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:06.233]  David Knight and Rob Due gave a really in-depth presentation of a whole other level of geospatial simulation and how this is tying into Jade Home.
[00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:14.919]  They are mapping humans onto the geological map, and they're looking at you at the individual level, every aspect of you.
[00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:17.540]  This is where the surveillance pays off for them.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.681]  This is the geo-int, the human domain.
[00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:25.443]  And when they say mastering the human domain, it's a very specific term of art from the military.
[00:05:25.503 --> 00:05:26.564]  And this has been an evolution.
[00:05:26.624 --> 00:05:30.306]  It started off as, we're going to get real detailed maps of everything using satellite imagery.
[00:05:30.606 --> 00:05:31.946]  Well now they have these detailed maps.
[00:05:32.167 --> 00:05:34.268]  Now they know who lives at what address.
[00:05:34.608 --> 00:05:38.430]  And now they're tying that in with your Facebook account, with your Twitter account, with your YouTube videos.
[00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:47.395]  So they're measuring your political beliefs and they can go up and down and go, well he's kind of for us, this guy's against us, this guy's pulling the party line, this guy isn't, we need to put him on a watch list.
[00:05:47.675 --> 00:05:49.636]  And they're using all this for future operations.
[00:05:50.236 --> 00:05:50.396]  No, I
[00:06:05.213 --> 00:06:06.034]  That's what you have to understand.
[00:06:06.054 --> 00:06:18.226]  When they talk about the human domain, when they talk about geo-intelligence, mapping this all together, they're multi-int, taking all of this, multiple intelligence sources, focusing it down to the micro-level.
[00:06:18.246 --> 00:06:27.214]  They're very concerned, they say in these presentations, they're very concerned about one guy with a computer and a video camera because he can have worldwide impact.
[00:06:27.415 --> 00:06:29.797]  That's why they're looking at you as an individual.
[00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:30.477]  Exactly.
[00:06:30.758 --> 00:06:32.079]  And now I want to go to this first clip.
[00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:34.080]  This is Lieutenant Colonel Al DiLenardo.
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.244]  This is from the Master of the Human Domain 2010 GEOINT conference.
[00:06:38.684 --> 00:06:40.365]  And he used to run a fusion cell for U.S.
[00:06:40.405 --> 00:06:41.186]  Special Forces.
[00:06:41.666 --> 00:06:43.588]  Okay, so this is not some ordinary guy.
[00:06:43.868 --> 00:06:47.851]  Just like that's the bottom of the Jade Helm logo, Master of the Human Domain.
[00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:53.275]  The cell's objectives were to use as much non-traditional data
[00:06:54.837 --> 00:06:58.339]  From an Intel standpoint, that means a lot of open source data.
[00:06:58.679 --> 00:07:12.188]  To go out and do sense making of data, so that not only your analysts, but your machine learning, your algorithms you could build, would ultimately get to a predictive analysis cell.
[00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:16.351]  It's very, very hard to do, especially if you don't have all the data.
[00:07:16.511 --> 00:07:21.815]  Basically, old data is good data, new data is good data, and all data is good.
[00:07:23.015 --> 00:07:30.499]  In the context of how I view human terrain, it's somewhat controversial in some aspects.
[00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:41.064]  It's sociocultural information and it becomes, when used in intelligence purposes or for sense making for operations,
[00:07:41.744 --> 00:07:50.310]  When you bring it to the GEOINT, and I don't mean to be coy in saying that, when you bring GEOINT to it, I think it becomes human terrain.
[00:07:50.531 --> 00:07:59.097]  You have to reach out and have people using traditional, non-traditional data sets as you see there further to the right.
[00:07:59.197 --> 00:08:03.900]  And ultimately as you bring in ESRI products and GEOINT, you get outputs.
[00:08:05.141 --> 00:08:10.245]  as unclassified examples there of different layers that you would make.
[00:08:10.846 --> 00:08:21.614]  It's that open source combined with the classified information, combined with the now, the old and the now, that begins to give you the layers you can make to make sense of what's really going on.
