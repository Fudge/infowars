[00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:18.153]  So, Mr. President, how do you, uh, how do you handle, uh, how do you handle promises that you've made when you were running for election?
[00:00:18.773 --> 00:00:21.555]  And how do you handle, uh, how do you handle it?
[00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:23.316]  I mean, what do you say to people?
[00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:31.459]  Do you, uh, do you just, uh, you know, I know people, uh, people were wondering.
[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.620]  You don't, you don't have it.
[00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:34.281]  Okay.
[00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.522]  How sad was it in the streets of Paris?
[00:00:37.426 --> 00:00:44.775]  As 40 world leaders walked down the street, absent was the United States of America.
[00:00:45.657 --> 00:00:46.317]  Where was the president?
[00:00:46.557 --> 00:00:59.680]  Attorney General Eric Holder was in Paris for a terrorism summit with French President Hollande, but darted out just before world leaders historically convened to pay their respects to the fallen Charlie Hebdo cartoonists.
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.281]  Holder then went on a media blitz claiming that there is no credible threat to Americans.
[00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:09.382]  The entire threat environment is as dangerous as anything you've seen since 9-11.
[00:01:09.662 --> 00:01:10.522]  Is that still the case?
[00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.292]  Yeah, I would say that that's true, although there's not a specific credible threat that I can point to.
[00:01:16.752 --> 00:01:33.237]  It makes the average American wonder what the Obama administration is hiding when anyone can go online and discover the clear and present danger of decades-old State Department documents revealing what has been lurking within at least 22 of our United States.
[00:01:33.257 --> 00:01:36.338]  A secret videotape uncovered by our investigation team.
[00:01:37.046 --> 00:01:43.790]  Sheikh Jilani is seen here both recruiting American Muslims and instructing them in Islamic guerrilla warfare tactics.
[00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.252]  The tape is known as Soldiers of Allah.
[00:01:48.693 --> 00:02:03.221]  On behalf of the Muslims of America, I present before you a documentary film in helping and training oppressed Muslims.
[00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:06.483]  I'm proud to say I had to sit with the
[00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:23.931]  with the Greeks who have been successful in founding an international organization which is called Soldiers of Allah S.O.A.
[00:02:24.371 --> 00:02:27.433]  and we are establishing training camps.
[00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:29.634]  You can reach us, you know,
[00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:42.470]  At Quranic Open University offices in upstate New York, or in Canada, or in Michigan, or in South Carolina, or in Pakistan, wherever we are, you can reach us.
[00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.018]  You're most welcome to join one of our, you know, advanced training course in Islamic Literature.
[00:02:49.767 --> 00:02:57.349]  The Clarion Project, who I work for, we broke this story about how a terrorist enclave has been detected in Texas.
[00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.750]  We know this from declassified FBI documents.
[00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.711]  There was originally some broad intelligence about it, and so we started investigating.
[00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:07.752]  We figured out the group's front organizations that they were using in Texas.
[00:03:08.132 --> 00:03:16.200]  And then some activists from a group called Act for America went and verified the specific location so that we made sure that we definitely knew what we were talking about.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.224]  And then we got declassified FBI documents and confirmed it from that end.
[00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:27.912]  So we know for a fact that this organization that runs the 22 villages, as they call them, also have one in Texas.
[00:03:28.072 --> 00:03:49.805]  In 2001, ATF Special Agent Thomas P. Gallagher testified in court that individuals from the organization Muslims of the Americas are trained in Hancock, New York, and if they pass the training in Hancock, New York, are then sent to Pakistan for training in paramilitary and survivalist training by Mr. Jelani.
[00:03:50.365 --> 00:04:04.015]  On January 23, 2002, American journalist Daniel Pearl was kidnapped on his way to question Sheikh Mubarak Ali Jilani's connection to shoe bomber Richard Reed in downtown Karachi.
[00:04:04.295 --> 00:04:06.797]  Nine days later, Pearl was decapitated.
[00:04:07.077 --> 00:04:12.381]  On May 16, his severed head and decomposed body were found cut into ten pieces.
[00:04:12.681 --> 00:04:16.304]  Jilani was temporarily in Pakistani custody after the kidnapping.
[00:04:16.724 --> 00:04:28.610]  The main compound near the town of Hancock in upstate New York, known as Holy Islamburg, was founded in 1980 by Jelani as a religious sanctuary for devout Muslims.
[00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.133]  This land is located near the reservoir that supplies most of New York City's drinking water.
[00:04:34.393 --> 00:04:43.458]  In fact, most of the compounds are near strategic locations within the United States designed to affect a mass population event at any time.
[00:04:43.778 --> 00:04:50.645]  According to the 2006 law enforcement report, Jelani opened his compounds near significant infrastructure targets.
[00:04:51.366 --> 00:04:55.009]  Islamville is less than five miles away from the Qataba nuclear facility.
[00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:08.002]  The FBI's own documents define the Muslims of America as an autonomous organization which possesses an infrastructure capable of planning and mounting terrorist campaigns overseas and here within the U.S.
[00:05:08.462 --> 00:05:13.308]  How can the Obama Administration claim they are concerned about lone wolf attacks, i.e.
[00:05:13.368 --> 00:05:24.561]  gun owners, tea partiers, and constitutionalists, when training videos clearly link Shiite Mubarak Ali Jilani to an expanding network of radical Islamic cells within the United States?
[00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:33.546]  Further State Department documents have not listed FUQRA as a terror organization, regardless of countless felonies committed by its members.
[00:05:34.046 --> 00:05:51.836]  Jelani's intent is echoed by the Muslim Brotherhood with slogans like, God is our objective, the Prophet is our leader, the Quran is our law, Jihad is our way, dying in the way of God is our highest hope, and Obama's ties to the Muslim Brotherhood are becoming increasingly well known.
[00:05:51.856 --> 00:05:51.916]  Why?
[00:05:53.917 --> 00:06:01.443]  Why President Barack Hussein not hitting hard on the terrorists and on ISIS?
[00:06:02.204 --> 00:06:04.986]  And I know it sounds crazy, but bear with me.
[00:06:06.788 --> 00:06:11.532]  President Barack was born after his older brother Malik.
[00:06:12.426 --> 00:06:18.910]  The father, Mr. Hussein, named his son Malik, and that's one of God's names in Islam.
[00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.912]  The second son, he named him Burak.
[00:06:22.572 --> 00:06:23.973]  What does Burak mean?
[00:06:24.754 --> 00:06:34.980]  Burak is the right Prophet Muhammad, and we can see Mr. Malik sitting with Mr. Obama, visiting him in the White House.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.303]  Mr. Malik is in charge of the Muslim Brotherhood in Africa.
[00:06:40.003 --> 00:06:44.367]  There's a lot of finances going on through Mr. Malik.
[00:06:44.707 --> 00:06:50.172]  And we can see him in another picture holding the Yemenian dagger on his waist.
[00:06:51.333 --> 00:06:54.155]  And he is a big supporter to the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:06:54.596 --> 00:06:57.798]  And that explains that Mr. Barack
[00:06:58.632 --> 00:07:02.315]  Hussain is not hitting hard on the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:07:02.635 --> 00:07:06.578]  On the contrary, he took them off the terrorist list.
[00:07:07.038 --> 00:07:12.802]  For years and years, the Muslim Brotherhood is on the terrorist list around the world.
[00:07:13.002 --> 00:07:15.424]  In the Arab world, who knows them best?
[00:07:16.024 --> 00:07:24.170]  But Mr. Barack decided to take them off the terrorist list and start to be sponsoring them and put them in charge of Egypt.
[00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:34.978]  The IRS and your tax dollars allow these non-profit organizations openly hell-bent on the destruction of the United States to operate within the United States.
[00:07:35.298 --> 00:07:39.041]  Demographics show that the Muslim birth rate is the world's highest
[00:07:39.281 --> 00:07:40.081]  The lengths to which he will go
[00:08:06.952 --> 00:08:13.935]  To avoid telling us the truth about the enemy is becoming, or comical, it's certainly embarrassing.
[00:08:14.876 --> 00:08:18.798]  For example, he will never forget about that we use the word shihadist.
[00:08:18.838 --> 00:08:19.758]  He'll never use that.
[00:08:20.218 --> 00:08:25.181]  But he refuses to use the word Islamist, which is used throughout the Muslim world.
[00:08:25.661 --> 00:08:28.062]  It's used by journalists, by authors.
[00:08:29.002 --> 00:08:31.944]  There are a variety of reasons why people... But was radical Islam one of them?
[00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:35.686]  There are a variety of reasons why people do these things.
[00:08:35.746 --> 00:08:45.970]  Some of them are potentially religious... Okay, but all I'm asking is if you think among those variety of reasons, radical Islam might have been one of the reasons that the individuals took the steps that they did.
[00:08:46.591 --> 00:08:47.671]  You see, you say radical Islam.
[00:08:47.711 --> 00:08:56.054]  I mean, I think those people who espouse a version of Islam that is not... Are you uncomfortable attributing any of their actions to radical Islam?
[00:08:56.114 --> 00:08:56.715]  It sounds like it.
[00:08:56.735 --> 00:09:01.517]  No, I don't want to say anything negative about a religion that is not... No, no, I'm not talking about a religion.
[00:09:02.517 --> 00:09:03.918]  I'm not talking about radical Islam.
[00:09:04.018 --> 00:09:06.300]  I'm not talking about the general religion.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.463]  Mr. Agee, it's hard to get an answer yes or no.
[00:09:09.863 --> 00:09:13.567]  And look, the Middle East is coming apart with this administration's policy.
[00:09:13.607 --> 00:09:14.327]  Look at Libya.
[00:09:14.367 --> 00:09:15.949]  We should never have gone into Libya.
[00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:17.610]  Gaddafi was on our side.
[00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:18.331]  Look at Egypt.
[00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:23.535]  Morsi is now going after the Muslim Brotherhood and the radical Islamists.
[00:09:23.695 --> 00:09:25.617]  And we've got Muslim Brotherhood in the U.S.
[00:09:25.657 --> 00:09:26.398]  government today.
[00:09:27.753 --> 00:09:29.894]  And so, look at what's going on in Syria.
[00:09:29.914 --> 00:09:31.774]  Wait, who from the Muslim Brotherhood is in the U.S.
[00:09:31.794 --> 00:09:32.535]  government right now?
[00:09:33.015 --> 00:09:33.235]  Who?
[00:09:33.495 --> 00:09:33.695]  Yes.
[00:09:34.615 --> 00:09:40.417]  Oh, look, I haven't got their names exactly, but there's a list of them, at least 10 or 15 of them.
[00:09:40.477 --> 00:09:43.538]  Do you know any major Arab ally that embraces ISIL?
[00:09:44.178 --> 00:09:46.939]  I know major Arab allies who fund them.
[00:09:47.369 --> 00:09:59.326]  He spent about an hour meeting with five different rebel commanders who came from all over Syria to plead with him for heavier weapons, a no-fly zone, and airstrikes against the forces of President Bashar al-Assad.
[00:09:59.526 --> 00:10:03.572]  Arming the enemy and advancing its movement towards the United States' wide open borders.
[00:10:03.772 --> 00:10:08.655]  If ever a US President committed treason and deserved impeachment, the time is now.
[00:10:08.835 --> 00:10:19.982]  Regardless of our long-standing stance on religious freedom, these terror cells are being protected for what blatantly appears to be a key component of the New World Order's endgame on American soil.
