[00:00:11.358 --> 00:00:15.302]  I wanted to close out the week with a few positive gun stories that you likely didn't hear about.
[00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:19.426]  Burglar armed with broken glass scared away by a homeowner with a gun.
[00:00:20.147 --> 00:00:25.673]  A woman is behind bars after breaking into a Santa Fe home recently, only to be met by an armed homeowner.
[00:00:26.213 --> 00:00:29.955]  Erica Duran, age 32, broke a window to gain access to the home.
[00:00:30.415 --> 00:00:36.098]  The homeowner told authorities that Duran armed herself with a piece of broken glass just before he opened fire.
[00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.840]  Now, Duran was not struck by the bullet, but it was enough to scare her off.
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.822]  And if you say, well, it's just a piece of broken glass and he didn't have to shoot at it, well, how about this?
[00:00:44.463 --> 00:00:48.725]  Armed clerk kills two suspects after robbery attempt, two more in custody.
[00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:57.505]  Now, police report the clerk last night shot and killed 27-year-old Brian Powell, 20-year-old Lakeith Thompson arrested by officers.
[00:00:57.605 --> 00:01:01.787]  As he returned here to the scene, he was arrested for armed robbery and second-degree murder.
[00:01:02.108 --> 00:01:05.870]  And 16-year-old Kevin Dobbs, also shot by the clerk, he later died.
[00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.111]  A second minor arrested for robbery and murder as well.
[00:01:09.452 --> 00:01:13.334]  Police say all four were wanted for at least seven Tulsa robberies.
[00:01:13.694 --> 00:01:17.496]  A manager here says security cameras caught everything that played out last night.
[00:01:17.816 --> 00:01:19.057]  It is being reviewed by police.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.356]  And if that wasn't enough, armed customers stopped restaurant robbery suspects in their tracks.
[00:01:26.863 --> 00:01:29.644]  And all of a sudden, my wife just ran back, panicking.
[00:01:29.864 --> 00:01:36.006]  Khoi Sam was closing and two customers were finishing their meals when two men walked in with guns.
[00:01:36.546 --> 00:01:40.367]  One of them forced the couple to the ground while the other went for the register.
[00:01:40.807 --> 00:01:45.949]  But he never made it because one of the customers wrestled him down first with a gun.
[00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.909]  He was amazing.
[00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.811]  He absolutely kept us all calm, make sure everything's okay.
[00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:55.372]  As he held the suspect for police, he fired as the other one ran off.
[00:01:56.758 --> 00:01:58.980]  And finally, news that made me very happy.
[00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:04.966]  Because we see incidents where a clerk may open fire or somebody at a restaurant opens fire and they lose their job.
[00:02:05.227 --> 00:02:07.949]  But I'm very proud of Papa John's by standing by their employee.
[00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:16.338]  And we have the article, Papa John stands by employee who shot armed robber in the face when he forced her to the ground at gunpoint in a pizza delivery setup.
[00:02:16.718 --> 00:02:20.302]  So the situation was a young woman was out delivering her pizzas for the day.
[00:02:20.842 --> 00:02:22.523]  Armed suspect comes, forces her to the ground.
[00:02:22.563 --> 00:02:27.065]  She's able to reach into her pocket, pull out her concealed carry, and shoots the guy in the face.
[00:02:27.505 --> 00:02:30.266]  It's my understanding that he is in custody and did not die from the wound.
[00:02:30.546 --> 00:02:33.047]  But these are the positive stories that you normally don't hear about.
[00:02:33.307 --> 00:02:40.771]  You hear about all the doom and gloom, and yes, that stuff happens, but you also have positive people, positive stories of people using their firearms for self-defense.
[00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:43.972]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
