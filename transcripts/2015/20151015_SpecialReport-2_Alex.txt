[00:00:11.884 --> 00:00:20.353]  Recently, the University of Texas pulled the Jefferson Davis statue from its campus because of a growing irrational fear of American history.
[00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:25.079]  On the northwest axis of 3rd and D in the nation's capital sits
[00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:34.301]  The Albert Pike Statue, dedicated to the leader of the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite, a title Pike held for 32 years.
[00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:37.262]  He was also a Confederate Brigadier General.
[00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:44.004]  He was also the Chief Judicial Officer and Arkansas Grand Dragon of the newly formed Ku Klux Klan.
[00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:46.985]  This is the only statue in Washington D.C.
[00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:51.648]  commemorating a Confederate soldier, much less a founding member of the Klan.
[00:00:51.868 --> 00:00:58.611]  In fact, Pike was said to have owned a bracelet that allowed him perpetual communication with Lucifer himself.
[00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:06.455]  So if the Confederate flag is being denounced and Jefferson Davis and other Confederate monuments are under consideration for removal,
[00:01:06.735 --> 00:01:09.817]  Why does this statue still remain simple?
[00:01:10.117 --> 00:01:17.421]  Pike is highly revered by the very occultic groups in control of the puppet government installed in Washington D.C.
[00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:29.268]  His 1871 letter to Illuminati Mafia founder Giuseppe Mazzini predicts a succession of three world wars, a game plan followed to a tee by the global elite.
[00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:35.292]  It was Pike that wrote the rituals that would create a secret society within a secret society.
[00:01:35.932 --> 00:01:37.313]  The 33rd Degree.
[00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:46.058]  The 33rd Degree would serve as a continuation of the Luciferian goals established by an older order known as the Order of the Palladium.
[00:01:46.258 --> 00:01:51.921]  All master masons brought into the higher degrees would have to take orders from higher masons.
[00:01:52.221 --> 00:01:57.724]  This long list of initiates includes presidents, supreme court justices, and military leaders.
[00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:02.687]  It was Pike and Illuminati conspirators that infiltrated the world of Freemasonry
[00:02:02.947 --> 00:02:14.893]  Armed with a doctrine to establish a One World Order, these conspirators, such as Lord Henry Palmerston of England and Otto von Bismarck of Germany, built global hubs for the Illuminati.
[00:02:14.973 --> 00:02:22.597]  And these hubs, known as the Supreme Councils of the Scottish Rite, like the one located at 1733 16th Street NW in Washington DC, have been in operation ever since.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.701]  Washington D.C.
[00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:39.829]  itself is reputed to have been designed to represent a pentagram in the Masonic Square and Compass, which would add to the confusing manner in which the streets of the District of Criminals are set up.
[00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.793]  Masons have long argued that Pike was not a member or founding father of the Klan.
[00:02:45.074 --> 00:02:52.319]  However, the 1905 publication Ku Klux Klan, Its Origin, Growth, and Disbandment by J.C.
[00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:53.260]  Lester and D.L.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.163]  Wilson clearly lists Albert Pike as one of its founding members.
[00:02:57.483 --> 00:03:03.688]  This book was intent on glorifying the Klan and its origins, hardly an effort to spread misinformation.
[00:03:04.068 --> 00:03:12.695]  If awareness grows, the very people behind the liberal agenda to spread political correctness while abandoning our ugly American history
[00:03:12.955 --> 00:03:20.020]  We'll have clumsily uncovered a nest of treasonous activity and Luciferian dogma exposed in the light of day.
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.364]  Albert Pike issued this statement to the 23 Supreme Councils of the world.
[00:03:25.684 --> 00:03:30.528]  We worship a God, but it is the God one adores without superstition.
[00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:38.213]  To you, Sovereign Grand Instructors General, we say this, that you may repeat it to the Brethren of the 32nd, 31st, and 30th degrees,
[00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:49.181]  The Masonic religion should be, by all of us initiates of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of the Luciferian doctrine.
[00:03:49.401 --> 00:03:50.882]  Albert Pike, July 14th, 1889.
