[00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.851]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:26.232]  It is Friday, January 9th, 2015, and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.513 --> 00:00:27.933]  Here are tonight's top stories.
[00:00:30.654 --> 00:00:31.094]  Tonight.
[00:00:32.855 --> 00:00:33.515]  Exclusive.
[00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:37.797]  An RPG was fired inside the Charlie Hebdo office.
[00:00:38.277 --> 00:00:41.098]  Then, is a new cyber attack imminent?
[00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:44.679]  And filmmaker Kevin Booth talks media censorship.
[00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.781]  That's next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:52.635]  Well, I've got to say I'm really ashamed of Western media in the U.S.
[00:00:52.896 --> 00:00:53.818]  and in Europe.
[00:00:55.387 --> 00:01:03.751]  Three terrorists and four hostages are dead today after the French police stormed two hostage situations in France earlier today.
[00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:12.015]  Now this includes the two brothers who were suspected of massacring 12 people at the Paris newspaper Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday.
[00:01:12.715 --> 00:01:20.579]  They were killed while the single hostage that they were holding survived the ordeal unharmed and the police staged a separate assault
[00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:30.145]  On a kosher supermarket in Paris, where a second hostage situation was taking place, that hostage taker was believed to be an associate of the two brothers.
[00:01:30.485 --> 00:01:31.205]  He was killed.
[00:01:31.406 --> 00:01:33.327]  Four hostages there were killed.
[00:01:33.507 --> 00:01:38.370]  Several others were injured, while five were able to be released unharmed.
[00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.474]  Now, it's believed that the gunman at the supermarket is connected to the earlier killing of a policewoman.
[00:01:45.294 --> 00:01:46.455]  That happened yesterday.
[00:01:46.955 --> 00:01:54.400]  But before the suspects were killed, they spoke out via the telephone with a French television station.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.261]  And here's what they said.
[00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:57.702]  I was sent by Al-Qaeda from Yemen.
[00:01:57.842 --> 00:02:02.345]  I went there and it was Sheikh Anwar Al-Awlaqi who financed me.
[00:02:02.365 --> 00:02:04.066]  May Allah have mercy on him.
[00:02:04.086 --> 00:02:08.629]  Are you in contact with the two brothers who operated on Charlie Hebdo?
[00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:11.884]  Yes, we synchronized to do the operations.
[00:02:12.124 --> 00:02:13.325]  How did you synchronize?
[00:02:13.385 --> 00:02:14.466]  Are there other events planned?
[00:02:14.486 --> 00:02:15.487]  Do you have a scenario together?
[00:02:15.507 --> 00:02:17.308]  No, we just synchronized for the departure.
[00:02:17.328 --> 00:02:20.690]  When they started to get Charlie Hebdo, I started to get the police.
[00:02:25.618 --> 00:02:32.882]  Not exactly clear at this time if that shooter meant that he was the one who took care of the policeman that we saw on camera.
[00:02:33.522 --> 00:02:39.386]  Perhaps that's why the other suspect that was named turned himself in earlier this week.
[00:02:39.746 --> 00:02:49.912]  But al-Qaeda in Yemen is now coming out and saying that they claim to have directed this attack, tweeted out actually that it was revenge for the honor of Mohammed.
[00:02:50.852 --> 00:03:13.054]  And also it was interesting that one of the suspects there, Saeed, was specific to point out that he had met with Anwar al-Awlaki, and Reuters is also reporting that he did indeed meet with Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S.-born and web-savvy influential international recruiter to the al-Qaeda movement.
[00:03:13.835 --> 00:03:18.439]  So, of course, this story is just getting curiouser by the minute.
[00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:31.729]  It's not just the fact that these seemingly well-trained jihadists, who were so calm that they were able to go back and pick up a shoe, meanwhile, one of them left their ID in the getaway car.
[00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.110]  Very, very suspect.
[00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:40.996]  But now it's turned out that they have also been in contact with someone who spent a little time having dinner at the Pentagon.
[00:03:41.516 --> 00:03:44.177]  Here is our writer Mikhail Thelin with more.
[00:03:45.598 --> 00:03:48.660]  This is Mikhail Thelin with Infowars.com here with some breaking news.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.542]  If you look at Reuters right now they have an exclusive report from an intelligence source in Yemen.
[00:03:52.802 --> 00:04:06.369]  Turns out one of the brothers involved in the Charlie Hebdo shooting had actually in 2011 met with Anwar al-Awlaki and of course as many of you know Anwar al-Awlaki met with high-ranking military officials at the Pentagon only months after 9-11.
[00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:17.354]  And of course, later in 2002, it was later learned that the FBI actually had him in custody due to his ties to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and it turns out that he was in custody and let go.
[00:04:17.894 --> 00:04:22.316]  So now, if we fast forward again, we have Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer on the show in 2012.
[00:04:22.936 --> 00:04:25.237]  He exposed the fact that he was clearly working for the FBI.
[00:04:25.478 --> 00:04:27.679]  He was a triple agent also involved with the CIA.
[00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:32.261]  And so, what makes it even more obvious is the fact that, if you remember the
[00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:43.399]  Christmas Day bombing in 2009, or the attempted bombing by Umar Farooq Abdulmutallab, the so-called underwear bomber, that turned out to clearly be a government-run operation.
[00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.482]  And we know that Anwar al-Awlaki was running this guy.
[00:04:46.522 --> 00:04:48.103]  Kurt Haskell famously came on our show.
[00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:49.024]  He was on the flight.
[00:04:49.305 --> 00:04:53.629]  He saw what was going on, and later the State Department Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy
[00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:54.599]  We're good to go.
[00:05:17.065 --> 00:05:20.248]  And that's why they took him out with a drone strike, as many of you know, in 2011 as well.
[00:05:20.708 --> 00:05:23.711]  So, does this mean that the shooters are connected to an intelligence agency?
[00:05:23.751 --> 00:05:25.753]  Does this mean that there's government involved with this?
[00:05:25.793 --> 00:05:36.303]  We don't know, but this is definitely a major point that needs to be shown that clearly he had ties to someone who had ties to the FBI, the CIA, and really the whole intelligence officials.
[00:05:36.363 --> 00:05:40.406]  So, if you want to keep following us for more breaking news on this, head to InfoWars.com.
[00:05:41.653 --> 00:05:52.000]  So now, of course, almost immediately, it's coming out that the governments knew about these suspects beforehand for quite some time, yet these attacks were still able to take place.
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.423]  The massive NSA surveillance wasn't able to stop these attacks.
[00:05:56.503 --> 00:06:11.333]  Of course, it's the same old story, and instantly, we're seeing calls for over-militarization, saying that situations like this call for an over-militarization of the police, more NSA surveillance, when indeed, it didn't actually stop these attacks from happening.
[00:06:12.473 --> 00:06:13.474]  But it's just, that's what it is.
[00:06:13.694 --> 00:06:16.435]  Use these crises to call for more tyranny.
[00:06:16.455 --> 00:06:17.335]  And that's what we're seeing.
[00:06:18.036 --> 00:06:24.498]  Trying to keep everyone in this state of constant fear over these terrorists while they're not actually doing anything to stop it.
[00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:30.601]  Now this is coming out of the British Security Service, of course taking advantage of this hysteria.
[00:06:31.261 --> 00:06:33.622]  This is the Director General of MI5.
[00:06:35.663 --> 00:06:39.768]  Andrew Parker, he's warning that Coruscant will soon strike.
[00:06:40.148 --> 00:06:43.933]  This Coruscant, this elusive group that just sort of popped up out of nowhere.
[00:06:43.953 --> 00:06:50.520]  He says the MI5 boss told members of the Royal United Services Institute that a group of
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.804]  So this is the aim, keeping people scared of terrorist groups everywhere.
[00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:11.421]  Could they stop these potential jihadis beforehand?
[00:07:11.921 --> 00:07:12.842]  Absolutely!
[00:07:13.322 --> 00:07:28.330]  One of the ways they could do that is by not arming the rebels there because like we've reported before these arms are just getting into the wrong hands and here we have these suspects who spent some time in Yemen are apparently able to get their hands on some RPGs.
[00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:33.133]  Now this is a high-level military source in France who's associated with the
[00:07:33.533 --> 00:07:43.600]  French National Police confirmed exclusively to InfoWars that at least one rocket-propelled grenade was detonated inside the Charlie Edbo building.
[00:07:44.941 --> 00:07:48.243]  The French National Police kept quiet about the RPG.
[00:07:48.783 --> 00:07:56.089]  To keep from scaring the public, and it also of course explains why they released very few images from inside the office.
[00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:10.361]  So the suspects were known to the government officials for years, able to travel from Yemen, get their hands on some RPGs, but of course are never caught and are allowed to carry out these attacks.
[00:08:10.722 --> 00:08:13.644]  We've seen this so many times before, time and time again.
[00:08:14.965 --> 00:08:26.594]  And when these suspects were first identified, there were conflicting reports of if they had been to Yemen, had they not, and then of course now it comes out that they did, and now they have ties to the Pentagon.
[00:08:26.955 --> 00:08:29.056]  What else did we know about these suspects?
[00:08:31.118 --> 00:08:35.021]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com with an update on the Charlie Hebdo attacks.
[00:08:35.341 --> 00:08:38.424]  The Charlie Hebdo massacre suspects were on the U.S.
[00:08:38.504 --> 00:08:42.467]  no-fly list for years, and that they trained with al-Qaeda in Yemen.
[00:08:44.244 --> 00:08:48.706]  It says the two suspects behind the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris have been on a U.S.
[00:08:48.766 --> 00:08:50.766]  no-fly list for years, a U.S.
[00:08:50.806 --> 00:08:51.387]  official said.
[00:08:51.427 --> 00:08:59.830]  According to different revelations, one of the suspects trained with al-Qaeda-linked militants in Yemen, Sharif and Saeed
[00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.390]  So stay tuned for more reports.
[00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.191]  I'll keep you updated throughout the day.
[00:09:03.431 --> 00:09:04.231]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:09:21.596 --> 00:09:31.500]  Now the hacktivist group Anonymous has come out to say that they will avenge Charlie Hebdo attacks by shutting down any jihadist websites or anyone affiliated with them on social media.
[00:09:31.961 --> 00:09:41.725]  The group released a video and a statement via Twitter with a message for Al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, and other terrorists, and it was also uploaded to the group's Belgian account.
[00:09:42.085 --> 00:09:49.833]  The group says that they're going to track down and close all accounts on social networks that are related to terrorists in order to avenge those who have been killed.
[00:09:49.853 --> 00:09:57.400]  A backed up statement on Pastebin said, freedom of expression has suffered inhuman assault and it is our duty to react.
[00:09:58.661 --> 00:10:17.792]  Now, there's also an OpCharlieHedbo.com that we found earlier today, and it's actually a countdown clock on this website, so it's giving like a day sort of a countdown, but the official OpCharlieHedbo is saying that they're not responsible for that.
[00:10:17.832 --> 00:10:21.354]  They're saying it's a fake, it might be a scam, avoid it.
[00:10:21.474 --> 00:10:23.956]  So if you click there, you'll see it's kind of this countdown clock.
[00:10:23.996 --> 00:10:25.737]  They're saying they're not responsible for that.
[00:10:26.457 --> 00:10:32.663]  Now, officials have also come out saying that they're, you know, they're warning about a cyber Pearl Harbor.
[00:10:33.023 --> 00:10:42.933]  So here, if this op Charlie Headbow is saying that they're not responsible for creating this, are we going to see a Pearl Harbor and then maybe blame it on Anonymous?
[00:10:43.253 --> 00:10:44.515]  We'll just have to wait and see.
[00:10:45.015 --> 00:10:48.679]  But now this is coming from the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security.
[00:10:49.159 --> 00:10:56.601]  Michael McCaul, and he's here using this Sony attack to call, of course, for stricter cybersecurity legislation.
[00:10:56.621 --> 00:11:04.403]  This is, of course, despite the fact that cybersecurity experts refute the claim that North Korea had anything to do with it.
[00:11:04.483 --> 00:11:07.523]  They still say it was more likely an inside job.
[00:11:07.904 --> 00:11:13.545]  But of course, our government is going to just continue to say that we need tighter restrictions on the Internet.
[00:11:13.925 --> 00:11:22.949]  Now, McCall says that the real significance here lies in the fact that, according to the FBI, this marks the first major destructive cyber attack waged against a U.S.
[00:11:22.989 --> 00:11:28.691]  company, and there are little to no consequences for conducting cyber attacks.
[00:11:29.091 --> 00:11:33.953]  So, criminals in nation states are becoming bolder in their threats and their behavior.
[00:11:34.433 --> 00:11:36.474]  So, of course, what would be the answer here?
[00:11:36.914 --> 00:11:43.215]  More laws, more legislation, not doing anything to actually protect our critical infrastructure.
[00:11:43.755 --> 00:11:46.336]  Now, Snowden kind of alluded to this as well.
[00:11:46.936 --> 00:12:01.218]  He was being interviewed for an upcoming, I believe, a PBS documentary, and he said that the United States' efforts to dominate cyberspace may be misguided and are ultimately damaging to the country's national security.
[00:12:01.258 --> 00:12:03.039]  They're playing the wrong role, basically.
[00:12:03.079 --> 00:12:03.659]  The NSA
[00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:04.480]  Yes.
[00:12:24.673 --> 00:12:34.344]  This is if the foreign countries that we are attacking take this similar cyber posture and start trying to attack America's critical infrastructure.
[00:12:34.444 --> 00:12:39.791]  We have a lot more to lose because we are so dependent on the Internet.
[00:12:41.032 --> 00:12:41.372]  I think?
[00:12:56.129 --> 00:12:56.449]  I think?
[00:13:16.599 --> 00:13:23.362]  It's interesting to note that Snowden kind of backtracked on something that he was saying in the transcript here.
[00:13:24.022 --> 00:13:26.983]  He's basically explaining exactly what CISPA is.
[00:13:27.323 --> 00:13:32.245]  CISPA is the government saying, play ball with us, or the NSA saying, play ball.
[00:13:32.605 --> 00:13:32.885]  I think so.
[00:13:50.203 --> 00:13:50.624]  I think so.
[00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:12.720]  But then Snowden sort of backs it up and says, oh, you know, I think that's a little bit too complicated for the American people to understand.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.401]  So I don't understand where Snowden's going with this.
[00:14:16.461 --> 00:14:29.404]  He's basically saying that the NSA is bad, but then he's saying that we need tighter restrictions here, tighter regulations, basically saying we need a government that's not a gang style form of governance.
[00:14:30.592 --> 00:14:35.656]  Well, coming up, award-winning filmmaker Kevin Booth joins me in studio.
[00:14:35.676 --> 00:14:41.440]  We're going to talk about the attack on the free press, as well as the changing tide in the drug war.
[00:14:43.237 --> 00:14:45.820]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.061]  And the truth is, it's hard.
[00:14:47.341 --> 00:14:48.802]  Even with diet and exercise.
[00:14:49.003 --> 00:14:54.047]  Because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[00:14:54.187 --> 00:15:01.034]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise,
[00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:03.297]  Worthy answers that synergistically worked.
[00:15:03.558 --> 00:15:10.068]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[00:15:10.408 --> 00:15:16.318]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWars Life Resolution Pack, combining three essential formulations.
[00:15:16.798 --> 00:15:24.522]  Oxygen-Based Cleanser Oxy Powder, The Secret 12 Bioavailable Vitamin B12, and your choice of Super Female or Super Male Vitality.
[00:15:24.702 --> 00:15:31.286]  Now all available at a discounted price to you and your family to bring in the new year and make 2015 a true success.
[00:15:31.666 --> 00:15:32.807]  That's Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:15:32.827 --> 00:15:36.349]  2015 is the year to do it and it all starts at Infowarslife.com.
[00:15:54.654 --> 00:15:58.438]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[00:15:58.858 --> 00:16:00.040]  I can like taste dirt in it.
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.541]  God knows what's in this.
[00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:02.362]  This has an aftertaste.
[00:16:02.402 --> 00:16:04.004]  Tastes like Austin water?
[00:16:04.264 --> 00:16:05.125]  Yeah, it does.
[00:16:05.185 --> 00:16:09.349]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:16:09.589 --> 00:16:15.696]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:16:15.796 --> 00:16:16.597]  High quality H2O.
[00:16:17.177 --> 00:16:18.218]  That one is better.
[00:16:18.278 --> 00:16:19.239]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:16:19.519 --> 00:16:20.940]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:21.521]  It's good water.
[00:16:21.601 --> 00:16:30.148]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, Monsanto's deadly pesticide, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:16:30.549 --> 00:16:38.075]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[00:16:38.356 --> 00:16:40.858]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[00:16:41.398 --> 00:16:43.741]  Yeah, there's that processed flavor to it.
[00:16:44.102 --> 00:16:53.674]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances and many more, leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:16:53.714 --> 00:16:55.436]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:16:55.496 --> 00:16:56.197]  It's good water.

[00:16:57.753 --> 00:16:58.093]  It's good.

[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.781]  Joining me in studio today is award-winning filmmaker Kevin Booth.
[00:17:29.861 --> 00:17:34.762]  He's the director of American Drug War, American Drug War 2, and other films.
[00:17:35.342 --> 00:17:48.904]  And of course, he is constantly trying to shed some light on the upper echelons of government corruption, risking his life and not to mention blowback from some of the world's most dangerous drug cartels.
[00:17:49.804 --> 00:17:50.884]  Kevin, thanks for joining us.
[00:17:50.964 --> 00:17:51.965]  Sure, thanks for having me.
[00:17:51.985 --> 00:17:53.265]  It's great to be back in Austin.
[00:17:53.305 --> 00:17:53.645]  Yeah.
[00:17:54.705 --> 00:17:57.207]  So, obviously, it's always a dangerous time to be a journalist.
[00:17:57.687 --> 00:18:07.594]  You know, recently, obviously, we had the massacre at the Charlie Hebdo magazine in retaliation for their characterization of the Prophet Muhammad.
[00:18:08.295 --> 00:18:16.101]  But what we really covered here, we thought was even scarier, was the response by the mainstream media to self-censor.
[00:18:16.741 --> 00:18:24.791]  They would put up images of the police officer there who was begging for his life, yet they wouldn't put up a cartoon.
[00:18:24.952 --> 00:18:27.395]  What do you think about the attack on the free press?
[00:18:27.555 --> 00:18:28.736]  You know, I don't know.
[00:18:28.757 --> 00:18:30.138]  I don't know what to think.
[00:18:32.948 --> 00:18:38.990]  Part of us believe this is all like a staged event, you know, from the Alex Jones School of Thought here in the Alex studio.
[00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:46.372]  I mean, it almost feels like this little chapter has to do with kind of getting the liberals on board a little bit.
[00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:54.194]  You know, it's really interesting to suddenly see Bill Maher come on Jimmy Kimmel two nights ago and was just dead serious.
[00:18:55.274 --> 00:19:02.438]  And suddenly there's like this new kind of like vibe in the air with with Jon Stewart and these, you know, and I love all those guys.
[00:19:02.458 --> 00:19:03.078]  I love Bill Maher.
[00:19:03.138 --> 00:19:03.959]  I love Jon Stewart.
[00:19:03.999 --> 00:19:04.639]  I love all those guys.
[00:19:04.659 --> 00:19:10.202]  But it seems like now they're on board the war on terror and a whole new level that they weren't before.
[00:19:10.422 --> 00:19:13.904]  So, you know, it's it's like a it's like reaching a new level.
[00:19:14.352 --> 00:19:23.958]  Yeah, and people actively calling for even more militarization of the police, which there was actually a third hostage situation in Paris today.
[00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:43.592]  We don't really know if it had anything to do with the specifics of the Charlie Hebdo attack, but it just kind of goes to show that when you have, you know, 1,500 heavily militarized police in your city looking for people, they're still able to take hostages in another part of the city because they don't have guns to protect themselves, even the police officers don't.
[00:19:44.492 --> 00:20:00.263]  Calling for this over-militarization of the police doesn't even really make sense, especially when they're here policing us, you and I. But do you agree with some of these mainstream outlets that, you know, they shouldn't show certain images because they offend?
[00:20:00.788 --> 00:20:01.609]  No, no.
[00:20:02.129 --> 00:20:11.617]  I think we should be allowed to look at anything we want, and anytime they do that, they're just making you want it more, like this deal that just happened with that movie, The Interview.
[00:20:11.637 --> 00:20:25.950]  I mean, the whole time I was watching this whole Sony scandal, I'm thinking, either these people are idiots, or this is the most brilliant PR strategy campaign I've ever seen in my life, because it's a crappy movie, but now everybody's going to go see it, including me.
[00:20:27.276 --> 00:20:29.779]  And so, you know, you can't, it never works.
[00:20:29.799 --> 00:20:32.542]  Whenever you try to censor it, you're just going to make people want to see it.
[00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:35.566]  And yet they know that anyways.
[00:20:35.686 --> 00:20:37.809]  And so, yeah, it's just self-perpetuating.
[00:20:38.348 --> 00:20:50.197]  Yeah, and then now with the internet, it's always kind of coming back around that they sort of had their hand in it the entire time and they're thinking, oh, well, if we, we just, our sales were through the roof when we released it online, way more than they would have been.
[00:20:50.217 --> 00:20:55.361]  So now they're thinking that this could be something they, they could do in the future for other films.
[00:20:55.441 --> 00:20:58.264]  But are we going to have more fake cyber attacks?
[00:20:58.764 --> 00:20:59.585]  What was the last one?
[00:20:59.605 --> 00:21:01.286]  I remember the last temptation of Christ.
[00:21:01.326 --> 00:21:02.327]  So that was, that was one.
[00:21:02.367 --> 00:21:06.670]  I mean, every, every time one of these happens, it just, you know, it's a way of just making
[00:21:07.865 --> 00:21:19.476]  Everybody pay attention, you know, and so absolutely it's uh, you know, I don't I I think Censorship you you either have freedom of speech or you don't you know, there's no there's no line.
[00:21:19.496 --> 00:21:20.557]  You can't draw a line in there
[00:21:20.854 --> 00:21:37.072]  Right, well you've been really fearless with a lot of your films, and we've actually got a story up on InfoWars.com today about the drug cartels putting a $45 million bounty on Rick Perry's head, as well as Sheriff Arpaio.
[00:21:37.112 --> 00:21:39.755]  Who I spent time with, yeah.
[00:21:40.175 --> 00:21:42.438]  Do you ever fear for your life in that respect?
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:59.420]  You know, I mean I did censor one scene out of the last film I made and we were in this neighborhood in Juarez where I was shooting all this like really poor people and there was all these little rubble houses and people living in boxes and in the middle of all this was like this pimped out mansion.
[00:22:00.521 --> 00:22:01.081]  We're good to go.
[00:22:28.333 --> 00:22:30.055]  I chickened out on that one, I'll admit.
[00:22:30.335 --> 00:22:33.097]  Maybe I'll put out that image on my deathbed or something.
[00:22:33.237 --> 00:22:34.438]  It won't matter anymore.
[00:22:34.458 --> 00:22:35.739]  I don't know.
[00:22:39.537 --> 00:22:43.040]  You know, you gotta put yourself out there a little bit.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.062]  Obviously, I'm not brave or anything like that.
[00:22:45.082 --> 00:22:45.842]  I don't want to get hurt.
[00:22:45.862 --> 00:22:47.744]  I don't want anything bad to happen to me or my family.
[00:22:47.764 --> 00:22:50.106]  It tells stories.
[00:22:50.706 --> 00:22:53.188]  I think a lot of times when these things happen, it's very random.
[00:22:55.210 --> 00:23:02.796]  And as far as Sheriff Arpaio, I don't know that much about Rick Perry, but I know a lot more about Arpaio because I've been crossing lines with him for a while.
[00:23:05.033 --> 00:23:20.777]  It seems like, I mean, I remember when I went to go with him, he had like a bomb-proof car, and he's always had threats against his life and all that, and half of the time I think he's making those things up himself just to make himself famous in Phoenix, you know?
[00:23:20.797 --> 00:23:24.638]  And when you go to Phoenix, or back then when I was filming him, this is, you know, years ago,
[00:23:25.498 --> 00:23:29.479]  You know, you talk to anybody and it's just like, oh yeah, we like Sheriff Arpaio.
[00:23:29.519 --> 00:23:31.519]  Yeah, don't say anything bad about Sheriff Arpaio.
[00:23:31.579 --> 00:23:33.900]  You know, so it's like the whole city is afraid of their sheriff.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:40.401]  It's just a very bizarre thing of people living in Tent City that are like wanting his autograph, you know?
[00:23:40.421 --> 00:23:46.063]  It's like, oh, let's get the autograph of the man who's like forcing me to live out in a 130 degree tent.
[00:23:47.783 --> 00:23:49.243]  It's just, it's very weird.
[00:23:49.303 --> 00:23:51.724]  So, you know, as far as these cartels go,
[00:23:53.339 --> 00:23:55.600]  Yeah, it's just hard to tell.
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:02.924]  Is there really some centralized thing where this is all happening or is it just like one guy makes this threat.
[00:24:03.544 --> 00:24:07.466]  If I kill Rick Perry, am I really going to get $45 million?
[00:24:07.526 --> 00:24:09.207]  How do I collect that?
[00:24:09.227 --> 00:24:11.588]  Is that going to be over PayPal?
[00:24:11.668 --> 00:24:16.290]  Am I going to get my PayPal account to collect my reward?
[00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:19.312]  I don't know how much of that is real, how much of it is all talk.
[00:24:19.392 --> 00:24:19.712]  I don't know.
[00:24:19.952 --> 00:24:43.970]  Yeah, well I mean with the drug cartels I know just obviously being in the industry it is frightening at times a lot of people won't cover the activity as of the drug cartels because they'll chop off your head or you know shoot up the news station like they like they do there on the border in the border cities but now obviously we have radical Islam kind of coming out and doing this as well so we're seeing that they have these groups that are
[00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:52.116]  Beginning to react, you know when you poke the bear and now the bear is kind of showing its teeth It is kind of a scary thing.
[00:24:52.136 --> 00:24:59.782]  It's just kind of I guess with the with the there's something more honest I think about cartels and then the whole terrorist thing and that it's just all about money
[00:25:00.402 --> 00:25:01.323]  You know, I can't explain it.
[00:25:01.363 --> 00:25:13.192]  I know it's a bad, it's not a good thing to say, but it's something more honest about just handing someone money and saying go kill someone than it for being for some religious ideology that doesn't make any sense.
[00:25:13.292 --> 00:25:14.513]  It's just completely crazy.
[00:25:15.514 --> 00:25:16.694]  When I was in Juarez, I
[00:25:17.555 --> 00:25:17.896]  We're good to go.
[00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:40.834]  And so you got people with all this money next to people that are completely poor, and I think those kind of conditions are always going to craze.
[00:25:40.974 --> 00:25:46.737]  I think a lot of it is just poverty and ignorance, you know, and mixed in with people trying to make a lot of money and control people.
[00:25:46.757 --> 00:25:52.760]  And, you know, I think they just kind of spend things to their own advantage when they can.
[00:25:53.308 --> 00:26:08.628]  Yeah, so what do you think this, the fake drug war could have, what effect could that have if we, you know, I mean obviously your documentaries have done a lot to shine some light on the truth there, but do you think that could have any effect on, on, you know, these kids?
[00:26:09.872 --> 00:26:10.572]  You know, I don't know.
[00:26:10.592 --> 00:26:12.234]  I mean, right now, it's interesting.
[00:26:12.354 --> 00:26:14.435]  I go to Colorado.
[00:26:14.895 --> 00:26:19.779]  California was the leading edge of the whole marijuana thing for a while, but now Colorado is obviously taking the sword.
[00:26:19.819 --> 00:26:29.865]  And now it's interesting that neighboring states like Oklahoma are, I guess, suing Colorado because of all the marijuana coming over the border.
[00:26:30.025 --> 00:26:33.608]  And they're trying to use that as a reason of why it's not working.
[00:26:34.388 --> 00:26:39.752]  And I think anybody with half a brain would look at that and go, well, that's a reason why you should legalize it in Oklahoma.
[00:26:40.392 --> 00:26:48.315]  I mean, it just goes to show that people in Oklahoma, if people in Oklahoma are having to go to Colorado to buy marijuana, what am I missing here?
[00:26:48.335 --> 00:26:49.956]  What exactly am I missing here?
[00:26:49.976 --> 00:26:54.438]  Of course, then you've got Oklahoma and it's like oral robbers and all that, so I don't know.
[00:26:54.458 --> 00:26:55.879]  They've got the 900 foot Jesus there.
[00:26:55.959 --> 00:26:56.819]  I don't know what to think.
[00:26:58.154 --> 00:27:05.439]  Well, okay, so in American Drug War, the first American Drug War, you set out to discover basically why the drug war is such a big failure.
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:10.643]  American Drug War II, the second film, follows cutting edge of cannabis research.
[00:27:11.464 --> 00:27:15.927]  Obviously a few years in between those films, so we're starting to see a shift.
[00:27:16.487 --> 00:27:17.768]  Where do we see this going?
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:31.949]  Well, it's interesting that we've gone all the way from marijuana is bad for you, can cause cancer to a gateway drug, all the way to marijuana can actually not only help with cancer, but actually cure cancer in some forms, you know?
[00:27:32.089 --> 00:27:35.231]  I mean, how much further do you have to go?
[00:27:35.251 --> 00:27:45.057]  You know, meanwhile, every day the FDA is approving another, like, hellish drug and saying that's okay, even though it has all these incredible, horrible side effects.
[00:27:45.677 --> 00:27:45.978]  And yet,
[00:27:47.038 --> 00:27:51.401]  And 80% of the population wants marijuana legalized and yet they're going to just keep clinging on to this.
[00:27:51.481 --> 00:28:05.109]  I think the drug war and what's happening with legalization of marijuana and the whole movement right now is just so in your face of how corporate interests are outweighing the voters' desires.
[00:28:05.629 --> 00:28:10.552]  And it's just getting more and more blatant as time goes because with the internet and social media,
[00:28:11.889 --> 00:28:20.440]  You know, the secret is out of the bag, the genie's out of the bottle, that marijuana should have never been illegal in the first place, and it wasn't in the first place.
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:21.860]  It's a plant.
[00:28:21.981 --> 00:28:26.884]  Yeah, it's a plant, you know, and it just sucks.
[00:28:26.984 --> 00:28:28.866]  I mean, it should be growing everywhere.
[00:28:28.886 --> 00:28:35.811]  You come to Texas and you see all these people that could really use it and need it, and it's like, why isn't it just growing everywhere?
[00:28:35.831 --> 00:28:41.796]  And meanwhile... Yeah, well, because the drug cartel Big Pharma doesn't want that to happen.
[00:28:42.376 --> 00:28:48.398]  Meanwhile, people are dying from Tylenol and cough syrup.
[00:28:48.958 --> 00:28:53.479]  People's lives are destroyed from being addicted to these pharmaceutical drugs.
[00:28:53.719 --> 00:29:06.203]  Not to mention, when you get into this, people go down the rabbit hole of taking pain pills, and then once you start taking pain pills for so many years, you end up having to take antidepressants,
[00:29:07.102 --> 00:29:13.185]  And then you start to have to take pills that are like to counterbalance the problems created by the antidepressants.
[00:29:13.405 --> 00:29:13.645]  Yeah.
[00:29:13.825 --> 00:29:15.446]  And that's just like, oh, it's just okay.
[00:29:15.486 --> 00:29:16.807]  And the doctors will just keep beating you down that day.
[00:29:16.827 --> 00:29:18.068]  Yeah, take this for that and this for that.
[00:29:18.088 --> 00:29:19.829]  And then they're commingling with each other.
[00:29:19.929 --> 00:29:24.851]  And your blood pressure is going off the wall and you're having suicidal thoughts.
[00:29:24.931 --> 00:29:27.092]  But you mentioned to your doctor, like, what about cannabis?
[00:29:27.132 --> 00:29:28.773]  Like... Exactly.
[00:29:29.013 --> 00:29:31.335]  And it's just, you know, it's just...
[00:29:32.847 --> 00:29:36.590]  I don't know, there's certain things that maybe shouldn't have been for profit.
[00:29:37.291 --> 00:29:46.438]  I believe in capitalism, but something about the medical profession being so for profit and how much profit there is in the pharmaceutical industry and all that.
[00:29:47.278 --> 00:29:48.079]  You know, I don't know.
[00:29:48.139 --> 00:29:51.221]  It feels like the whole medical profession just went off track somewhere.
[00:29:51.241 --> 00:29:51.802]  Absolutely.
[00:29:52.122 --> 00:29:53.884]  Being able to hold these cures from people.
[00:29:53.904 --> 00:29:53.984]  Yeah.
[00:29:54.044 --> 00:29:55.045]  Letting people die.
[00:29:55.485 --> 00:30:14.241]  And you know, and going into Obamacare and just all the hellishness of getting into Obamacare and even myself like on Obamacare now and having some little medical problem and like these crummy doctors they send me to and I have to go to like some bad neighborhood to have some Russian doctor who doesn't speak English using some 1960s equipment on me.
[00:30:15.762 --> 00:30:17.623]  You know, it's just like, damn, this is great.
[00:30:18.644 --> 00:30:19.004]  Woo!
[00:30:19.444 --> 00:30:22.086]  Affordable care for everybody.
[00:30:22.106 --> 00:30:23.187]  Can I just have some pot, please?
[00:30:23.207 --> 00:30:24.067]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:30:24.588 --> 00:30:26.008]  I'll just grow it myself.
[00:30:26.249 --> 00:30:31.992]  So what do you think about the states that have legalized it being able to push back against federal intrusion?
[00:30:32.032 --> 00:30:34.474]  We're still seeing that the war is still on there.
[00:30:34.494 --> 00:30:39.497]  In DC, the voters voted for it, and they're saying, no, you can't have that.
[00:30:39.517 --> 00:30:41.138]  We're going to go ahead and push back.
[00:30:41.398 --> 00:30:43.159]  Well, first of all, if you've ever been to DC,
[00:30:45.325 --> 00:30:48.387]  I can't imagine why you wouldn't want everybody to be high on pot.
[00:30:48.527 --> 00:30:49.507]  It's really scary.
[00:30:49.527 --> 00:30:53.530]  I mean, it's the most segregated, dangerous place in the world.
[00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:59.173]  And wherever there's a dangerous ghetto, trust me, it's better if they're all smoking pot.
[00:30:59.213 --> 00:31:00.954]  You want everybody to be high.
[00:31:01.214 --> 00:31:01.794]  Trust me.
[00:31:01.934 --> 00:31:02.234]  Yeah.
[00:31:02.414 --> 00:31:04.856]  If you want safer streets, pot.
[00:31:05.276 --> 00:31:05.576]  Yeah.
[00:31:05.937 --> 00:31:17.107]  But see, I don't think that that would work because then they couldn't keep everyone in this constant state of fear, like terrorism, because I don't think anyone's really worried about terrorists when they're, you know, high and laughing it.
[00:31:17.548 --> 00:31:23.374]  And I've never seen anybody that's been stoned, really heavily stoned, wanting to buy crack, you know?
[00:31:23.434 --> 00:31:27.217]  But I have seen plenty of people who are drunk wanting to get cocaine or speed.
[00:31:28.038 --> 00:31:29.680]  So the whole gateway theory
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:33.122]  Yeah, forget about it.
[00:31:33.923 --> 00:31:35.844]  The whole gateway theory is so ridiculous.
[00:31:37.446 --> 00:31:43.891]  It's putting marijuana in the same classification as other harsh drugs and then pharmaceuticals aren't.
[00:31:46.772 --> 00:31:53.454]  And you know, we became foster parents, too, back in Los Angeles, and all these foster kids are also on all this medication.
[00:31:54.115 --> 00:32:00.097]  They purposely drug all these foster kids up, and what becomes even trickier is when
[00:32:01.411 --> 00:32:07.013]  You know, the kids, like, they don't even want to get off it because they become addicted, you know?
[00:32:07.173 --> 00:32:11.514]  And yet they're convinced that they're not addicted to drugs because... They're legal.
[00:32:11.574 --> 00:32:12.614]  Because it's from a doctor.
[00:32:12.634 --> 00:32:12.934]  Right.
[00:32:13.234 --> 00:32:13.515]  You know?
[00:32:13.935 --> 00:32:16.075]  And even I'll be like, watch my little documentaries.
[00:32:16.135 --> 00:32:16.815]  It's like, no.
[00:32:17.176 --> 00:32:21.417]  It's like, you know, drug addiction is a lot stronger than reasoning.
[00:32:21.437 --> 00:32:25.418]  You know, drug addiction is a very powerful animal that overpowers everything.
[00:32:26.561 --> 00:32:48.633]  I've seen a lot of lives destroyed from that, just coming from Florida where it's a huge epidemic there, which is a lot of the time where we want to educate our viewers on jury nullification so that when they do have those opportunities to get in those courtrooms where they are looking at weed cases or whatever, they can decide if it's a just law to send someone to prison because they had a joint.
[00:32:49.315 --> 00:32:49.635]  Right.
[00:32:50.175 --> 00:32:56.078]  Not to mention, I mean, I think one of the, this whole thing is not even close to being over until we can start letting people out of prison.
[00:32:56.098 --> 00:33:02.781]  There's so many people that are still in prison for like little, small, ridiculous, you know, marijuana-related cases.
[00:33:05.839 --> 00:33:14.381]  You know, I think, I think there's a big part of the government now that's wanting to make everybody think like, oh, the pot, the pot thing is, you know, you, you guys don't need to be protesting about pot anymore.
[00:33:14.421 --> 00:33:15.902]  Just let, you know, go to Colorado.
[00:33:15.962 --> 00:33:16.822]  It's all good, you know?
[00:33:16.862 --> 00:33:17.022]  Yeah.
[00:33:17.682 --> 00:33:25.824]  And, and of course, a lot of people now are using Colorado as like, look at it's turning into like, you know, pot hell because look at all the people.
[00:33:26.044 --> 00:33:28.405]  But, you know, then just,
[00:33:29.245 --> 00:33:29.866]  I don't know.
[00:33:30.046 --> 00:33:31.107]  I'm sure it'll open up the gates.
[00:33:31.127 --> 00:33:32.929]  It's the excitement of it.
[00:33:33.149 --> 00:33:34.510]  I think it'll fizzle out a little bit.
[00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:39.995]  But yeah, if you let it spread out, it won't be such a hotbed for it.
[00:33:41.176 --> 00:33:45.599]  Hey, when they legalize it here in Texas, I'll be the first guy to try to open a dispensary on 6th Street.
[00:33:47.298 --> 00:33:48.078]  That'll be sweet.
[00:34:06.525 --> 00:34:13.228]  To go and spend their lives in prison, to idolize this kind of gang culture, drug culture, and things like that.
[00:34:14.768 --> 00:34:16.269]  What was your experience working?
[00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:21.011]  You mean if I don't go into debt to put corporate logos all over my body, I'm not cool?
[00:34:22.352 --> 00:34:22.912]  Yeah.
[00:34:23.972 --> 00:34:24.632]  I love Rick.
[00:34:24.792 --> 00:34:28.734]  I've been friends with Ricky now, God, over 10 years.
[00:34:28.754 --> 00:34:31.895]  I helped with his case a little bit, helped him get out of prison.
[00:34:33.936 --> 00:34:37.557]  Freeway Rick is awesome.
[00:34:37.618 --> 00:34:41.599]  There's a new film coming out that I didn't make this film, but I was a co-producer on it.
[00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:47.901]  I've helped with a little bit, called Crackin' the System, and it premieres on Al Jazeera in February.
[00:34:48.261 --> 00:34:51.042]  So check that out, Crackin' the System, the Freeway Ricky Ross story.
[00:34:51.062 --> 00:34:55.104]  It's an amazing, amazing job done by Mark Levin and others.
[00:34:55.632 --> 00:35:02.635]  Yeah, and he, I mean, were you shocked to, um, discovering anything with the CIA's connections with that?
[00:35:02.675 --> 00:35:06.297]  I mean, even when we spoke to him, he was like, well, I didn't know, you know, I just.
[00:35:06.697 --> 00:35:07.018]  Right.
[00:35:07.058 --> 00:35:14.861]  I mean, it's, you know, it's funny cause I, you know, I'm always like the guy, maybe because I'm a Libra who gets caught in the middle of people.
[00:35:14.901 --> 00:35:18.243]  Like I got caught in between Alex Jones and Peter Joseph of Zeitgeist.
[00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:21.105]  And I got caught in between Alex Jones and Mike Rupert.
[00:35:22.365 --> 00:35:29.612]  You know, Mike Rupert was like the LAPD guy that said the CIA was trying to pay him to do that.
[00:35:29.692 --> 00:35:34.597]  And Gary Webb died and then Mike Rupert just committed suicide.
[00:35:34.657 --> 00:35:39.882]  So it's like you see these whistleblowers committing suicide one after another.
[00:35:40.843 --> 00:35:45.186]  And, you know, there's part of you that says, like, oh, it's got to be the CIA killing him.
[00:35:45.206 --> 00:35:47.528]  And then there's another part of you that's like, well, I knew that guy.
[00:35:47.608 --> 00:35:52.131]  He was a little, like, off and depressed and maybe drank too much and all that.
[00:35:53.012 --> 00:35:58.496]  And sometimes I wonder if there's, like, a fine line on there where people just allow these things to get to them.
[00:35:58.596 --> 00:36:03.020]  I think maybe that's why Alex, Alex just seems to be kind of like this bullish character who just
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.843]  Can just keep going whether you love him or hate him.
[00:36:06.523 --> 00:36:11.830]  He just has this, you know, this ability to kind of like roll it off at the end of the night and enjoy life, you know, so.
[00:36:12.785 --> 00:36:18.369]  You know, if I could say that to all the Alex Jones viewers out there, don't take anything too seriously.
[00:36:19.129 --> 00:36:24.553]  If you allow yourself to get too bummed out or too freaked out by any of this, then they're winning.
[00:36:24.593 --> 00:36:25.393]  Yeah, they've won.
[00:36:25.473 --> 00:36:26.114]  And they've won.
[00:36:26.734 --> 00:36:33.859]  So no matter how scary or messed up the world seems, it's all just a ride, like Bill used to say.
[00:36:34.099 --> 00:36:34.779]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:36:34.819 --> 00:36:40.642]  That's what Alex told me when I first started working here was just go dance, go have fun, go out to dinner with your friends.
[00:36:40.662 --> 00:36:41.722]  That's how you win.
[00:36:42.042 --> 00:36:49.325]  Yeah, don't stay up all night like reading conspiracy books and like think, you know, just you gotta, you gotta just... That's what they want.
[00:36:49.345 --> 00:36:50.205]  Yeah, you gotta have balance.
[00:36:50.245 --> 00:36:51.986]  Keep your mind trapped in that fear.
[00:36:52.406 --> 00:36:53.927]  And to make people like us seem crazy.
[00:36:54.447 --> 00:36:55.427]  Absolutely.
[00:36:56.368 --> 00:36:59.529]  I know you were here speaking with Alex on the radio show today.
[00:37:00.229 --> 00:37:04.871]  Is there anything you can tell me about your top secret projects?
[00:37:04.891 --> 00:37:05.351]  I don't know.
[00:37:05.451 --> 00:37:06.632]  It's not that top secret.
[00:37:06.912 --> 00:37:08.952]  I've got a couple of documentaries underway.
[00:37:09.172 --> 00:37:12.294]  One is really serious and the other one is more comical.
[00:37:12.314 --> 00:37:13.194]  The serious one is
[00:37:16.556 --> 00:37:26.461]  It's going to be a look at how governments have been staged in elections and have been rigged throughout history to create the history of the world.
[00:37:26.681 --> 00:37:39.508]  It's a story that Alex Jones has told many times before, but the difference between this one is that we're going to be going over to a former Soviet country and telling a lot of the film from there.
[00:37:40.248 --> 00:37:45.251]  And so I'd like to give a shout out to everybody in Sofia, Bulgaria, who's watching this interview.
[00:37:45.911 --> 00:37:47.193]  That will be coming over there soon.
[00:37:47.233 --> 00:38:03.270]  And so we've got a very rare, amazing thing to have like a stronghold, a base of operations with SWAT-style security the whole bit to be able to go to some former Soviet places and do some journalism that would have never been possible before.
[00:38:03.991 --> 00:38:04.431]  Yeah.
[00:38:04.471 --> 00:38:05.732]  So that's that's one film.
[00:38:06.332 --> 00:38:09.553]  The other film is going to be another pot doc because I just can't stay off of it.
[00:38:09.614 --> 00:38:09.974]  I don't know.
[00:38:10.154 --> 00:38:10.574]  I just can't.
[00:38:10.594 --> 00:38:13.615]  It's just too fun and easy to make pot docs when you're surrounded by it.
[00:38:13.795 --> 00:38:14.336]  People love it.
[00:38:14.596 --> 00:38:16.677]  You know, as long as they're buying, I'm selling.
[00:38:18.737 --> 00:38:23.139]  But this one is going to be a look at all these publicly traded companies that are out there right now.
[00:38:23.179 --> 00:38:29.462]  There's over 130 publicly traded marijuana companies and a lot of them are all fraudulent.
[00:38:29.522 --> 00:38:36.265]  And it's become, it's become a way for, like it's a, it's, I'm looking at it as almost a new shift in the drug war.
[00:38:36.485 --> 00:38:42.108]  And, and you've got people out there that are making millions of dollars off of drugs that are never even touching drugs.
[00:38:42.748 --> 00:38:45.990]  And it's actually drug dealing has moved on to the stock market now.
[00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:46.350]  Yeah.
[00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:49.291]  And, you know, and a lot of it's penny stocks.
[00:38:49.672 --> 00:38:49.952]  Yeah.
[00:38:50.252 --> 00:38:57.316]  You know, and we're talking to people like Jordan Belford, who was actually cellmates with Tommy Chong when I visited Tommy in prison for the first Drug War film.
[00:38:58.796 --> 00:39:09.942]  Tommy was writing his book in prison at the time called Tao of Chong, and he had this Wall Street guy in prison with him, and he convinced this guy, hey, you should write a book.
[00:39:09.962 --> 00:39:11.543]  Well, it turned out to be The Wolf of Wall Street.
[00:39:12.063 --> 00:39:12.763]  Wow!
[00:39:12.863 --> 00:39:13.643]  How crazy is that?
[00:39:13.703 --> 00:39:17.825]  Yeah, I was going to say those guys are probably used to that sort of thing on there.
[00:39:17.965 --> 00:39:40.111]  Yeah, so Jordan Belford and so there's just a whole another layer right now going on in the marijuana industry that I don't think a lot of people are aware of that I think is absolutely fascinating and some Ponzi schemes that are in just crazy money-making schemes of people pulling millions of dollars out of thin air because
[00:39:41.152 --> 00:39:44.037]  A lot of people will just think like, hey, I'll invest in marijuana.
[00:39:44.097 --> 00:39:45.319]  It sounds like a good investment.
[00:39:45.339 --> 00:39:48.925]  Well, they're not realizing, you know, they better look at who they're really investing in.
[00:39:49.372 --> 00:40:03.218]  Right, well because there's all sorts of things that they can just kind of put out there, and then, oh, no, we've decided we're not going to legalize it in this state, or, I mean, but now we've got the PayPal founder just coming out, becoming one of marijuana's biggest investors.
[00:40:03.618 --> 00:40:07.880]  So we're seeing that, you know, the cat's kind of out of the bag on cannabis here.
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.540]  It's just, which way is it going to go?
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:16.063]  I personally think, you know, Monsanto and companies like this are trying to figure out how they can, you know,
[00:40:17.711 --> 00:40:21.054]  Turn it into a genetically modified thing to control.
[00:40:21.094 --> 00:40:29.821]  There's been conspiracies ever since I've been in the pop movement about how companies are trying to put genetics into the marijuana thing.
[00:40:29.841 --> 00:40:36.387]  When you get into these high-end marijuana people, they're all about their genetics and owning proprietary genetics and all this.
[00:40:36.527 --> 00:40:38.028]  Yeah, certain strains.
[00:40:38.148 --> 00:40:39.149]  All these strains.
[00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:51.000]  Uh, um, and like being able to trademark or copyright or patent these strains and, and, you know, it'll be interesting to see if that's ever really able to be fought out in court or not, you know?
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:52.541]  So it's, it's interesting.
[00:40:52.701 --> 00:40:54.923]  Well, they can do it with corn and tomatoes.
[00:40:55.003 --> 00:40:55.404]  Yeah, I know.
[00:40:55.424 --> 00:40:57.105]  So I'm sure they, I'm sure they will in the future.
[00:40:57.185 --> 00:41:00.509]  So it's, it's going to be a, it'll be a crazy future, you know?
[00:41:01.169 --> 00:41:01.509]  I think so.
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:26.745]  And yeah, there are similarities to that, but then at the other end, people weren't able to grow great alcohol in their backyard.
[00:41:26.765 --> 00:41:30.127]  So marijuana is a different animal.
[00:41:30.147 --> 00:41:38.533]  It really lends itself to the do-it-yourselfers and the people who are not going to sign up to be a part of some big thing.
[00:41:38.573 --> 00:41:47.018]  Marijuana almost breeds a very loner, individualistic kind of thing in some regards compared to alcohol.
[00:41:47.386 --> 00:41:53.570]  Yeah, it already has been kind of thriving in the underground for all of this time.
[00:41:54.251 --> 00:41:54.491]  Right.
[00:41:54.511 --> 00:42:06.439]  I mean, when alcohol prohibition ended, people were like, okay, I want to get Bacardi rum, or I want to get, you know, when marijuana prohibition ends, people, they just, they're going to get whatever they can, wherever they can, and do it however they can.
[00:42:07.379 --> 00:42:12.920]  And they're going to try to spend as little money as possible, and there's just no way they can control it.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.341]  That's what's so amazing about pot.
[00:42:14.381 --> 00:42:15.841]  They just can't control it.
[00:42:15.901 --> 00:42:17.022]  They can't stop it.
[00:42:17.542 --> 00:42:20.062]  It's like a little weed that beat the government, you know?
[00:42:20.082 --> 00:42:20.362]  Yeah.
[00:42:20.382 --> 00:42:26.744]  That's what's great, because the more the government tried to, like, beat down this weed, actually, the stronger it got, you know?
[00:42:26.804 --> 00:42:31.325]  I mean, yeah, they complain about how there's so much more THC today.
[00:42:31.405 --> 00:42:33.926]  It's like, well, thanks to you guys, you know what I mean?
[00:42:35.049 --> 00:42:35.590]  That's right.
[00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:43.116]  You guys, because of what you guys, yeah, because of what you did, like the pot is better than ever because like people are out there perfecting that stuff, you know?
[00:42:43.336 --> 00:42:43.517]  Yeah.
[00:42:43.757 --> 00:42:54.546]  I mean, I've heard some of the best vegetables you're ever going to find are inside of prisons because where there's marijuana growers that are in prison because these guys are in there like making tomatoes and onions.
[00:42:54.606 --> 00:42:57.429]  They're like these little perfect, you know, things.
[00:42:57.509 --> 00:43:00.411]  And so Tommy Chong was telling me the best vegetables of all time are
[00:43:01.492 --> 00:43:06.254]  We want to make sure their scientific expertise doesn't lose that.
[00:43:06.314 --> 00:43:10.735]  Yeah, it's like this whole breed out there of people that are, you know.
[00:43:10.815 --> 00:43:20.859]  And so it's interesting to see this PayPal guy, this Peter Thiel, who I guess he's the one that they based that Silicon Valley show on, that HBO show, the Mike Judd show was based on him.
[00:43:20.879 --> 00:43:25.180]  So that's fascinating though that he's getting into this for sure.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:29.602]  Yeah, I think a lot of investors and people obviously watching the stock market are
[00:43:30.783 --> 00:43:37.751]  Like you said, trying to figure out how they can get in on this and maybe not in the penny stocks because we saw that in exactly the Wolf of Wall Street.
[00:43:37.791 --> 00:43:41.455]  It's funny how it all comes around, but that's how people are kind of losing out in this.
[00:43:42.356 --> 00:43:45.479]  Well, anything else you didn't get to talk about on the Alex Jones Show today?
[00:43:48.341 --> 00:43:49.961]  No, I feel pretty good.
[00:43:50.041 --> 00:43:51.982]  It was great coming to Austin and being here.
[00:43:52.042 --> 00:43:56.924]  We're glad to be a part of your upcoming top secret project.
[00:43:57.064 --> 00:43:58.565]  We're looking forward to it.
[00:43:58.625 --> 00:44:01.225]  Alex already did a great interview for it.
[00:44:01.386 --> 00:44:03.566]  I'm sure it's going to be a year or so before this thing comes out.
[00:44:03.586 --> 00:44:04.467]  There's a lot of work to do.
[00:44:05.447 --> 00:44:07.930]  Appreciate you guys having us here and you guys have been great.
[00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:09.892]  Well, we appreciate you and everything you've done.
[00:44:09.932 --> 00:44:13.936]  Documentary is obviously one of the best ways to break open minds.
[00:44:14.296 --> 00:44:14.877]  Alright, thanks so much.
[00:44:14.897 --> 00:44:16.638]  Shatter through the lies and illusion.
[00:44:16.658 --> 00:44:18.661]  Alright, alright, thank you.
[00:44:20.399 --> 00:44:21.780]  And that's it for the show tonight.

[00:44:56.908 --> 00:44:57.248]  Central.
[00:45:02.839 --> 00:45:06.641]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[00:45:07.061 --> 00:45:08.261]  I can taste dirt in it.
[00:45:08.321 --> 00:45:09.442]  God knows what's in this.
[00:45:09.602 --> 00:45:10.582]  This has an aftertaste.
[00:45:10.622 --> 00:45:12.203]  Tastes like Austin water?
[00:45:12.443 --> 00:45:13.303]  Yeah, it does.
[00:45:13.363 --> 00:45:17.525]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:45:17.765 --> 00:45:23.888]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:45:23.968 --> 00:45:24.828]  High quality H2O.
[00:45:24.848 --> 00:45:26.389]  That one is better.
[00:45:26.469 --> 00:45:27.469]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:45:27.729 --> 00:45:29.130]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.690]  It's good water.
[00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:38.338]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, Monsanto's deadly pesticide, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:45:38.759 --> 00:45:46.246]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[00:45:46.546 --> 00:45:49.049]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[00:45:49.609 --> 00:45:51.952]  Yeah, it has that processed flavor to it.
[00:45:52.292 --> 00:46:01.862]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances and many more, leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:46:02.383 --> 00:46:03.644]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:46:03.724 --> 00:46:04.385]  It's good water.
[00:46:05.083 --> 00:46:05.483]  Refreshing?
[00:46:05.503 --> 00:46:06.303]  It's good!
