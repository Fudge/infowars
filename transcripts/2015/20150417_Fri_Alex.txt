[00:00:01.788 --> 00:00:04.374]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:11.232 --> 00:00:13.792]  It's called an IMSI catcher or Stingray.
[00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:19.093]  A fake cell phone tower that sends your cell phone signal to it rather than a real cell phone tower.
[00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:23.874]  Netting suspected criminals and innocents alike to pinpoint their location.
[00:00:23.894 --> 00:00:28.295]  This is not about the content of people's communications or collecting every number that they dial.
[00:00:29.035 --> 00:00:34.776]  To me it's about we are using some equipment, appropriately in my view, to find bad guys.
[00:00:35.256 --> 00:00:38.297]  I don't want to say too much about that because I don't want the bad guys to know.
[00:00:39.195 --> 00:00:39.355]  Right?
[00:00:39.516 --> 00:00:40.738]  How we might be able to find them.
[00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:47.029]  And so one of the reasons that we ask local authorities who are working with us and using our equipment not to talk about it.
[00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.754]  It's not because I got something to hide from good people.
[00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:51.077]  I got a lot to hide from bad people.
[00:00:52.503 --> 00:00:55.906]  The FBI has bent over backwards to keep their public awareness secret.
[00:00:56.246 --> 00:01:01.671]  The provisions required by local and state police are straight out of a George Orwell novel.
[00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:10.278]  Police are not allowed to talk about the technology in press releases and court documents during judicial hearings or during other public forums or proceedings.
[00:01:10.698 --> 00:01:26.441]  If a district prosecutor intends to use details about how the Stingray works during a court case, police must alert the FBI in order to allow sufficient time for the FBI to intervene to protect the equipment, technology, and information from disclosure and potential compromise.
[00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:35.725]  If the agency receives a court order demanding release of the information, the agency must notify the FBI in order to allow sufficient time for the FBI to intervene.
[00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:46.970]  If the agency receives a FOIA request seeking information about the stingrays, it must alert the FBI to allow sufficient time for the FBI to seek to prevent disclosure through appropriate channels.
[00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.393]  A dystopian tug-of-war caused the FBI to have cases thrown out to protect the technology.
[00:01:52.773 --> 00:01:53.673]  2012, Buffalo, New York.
[00:01:53.833 --> 00:02:07.700]  Judge Patrick H. Niemeyer detailed against the FBI's orders how a deal was struck between the FBI and the Erie County Sheriff's Office to drop criminal charges rather than reveal any information concerning the cell site simulator or its use.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:17.245]  The record showed that of the 47 times the Sheriff's Office used stingrays in the past four years, it apparently only once obtained a court order, contradicting the Sheriff's own remarks.
[00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:28.111]  Stingrays are an advanced surveillance technology that can sweep up very private information, including information on innocent people, said NYCLU Western Region Director John Kerr III.
[00:02:28.512 --> 00:02:32.234]  If the FBI can command the Sheriff's Office to dismiss criminal cases,
[00:02:32.654 --> 00:02:41.175]  To protect its secret stingrays, it is not clear how the $350,000 we are spending on stingray equipment is keeping the people of Buffalo safe.
[00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:55.378]  They were more dedicated to the lawless, unconstitutional violation of civil liberties by spying on people without getting search warrants than they were to developing legitimate intelligence which would help secure our freedom or our safety.
[00:02:55.478 --> 00:03:02.619]  These records confirm some of the very worst fears about local law enforcement's use of this expensive and intrusive surveillance equipment.
[00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.083]  Said NYCLU staff attorney Mariko Haros.
[00:03:06.684 --> 00:03:19.640]  Not only did the sheriff's office promise the FBI breathtaking secrecy to keep information about stingrays as hidden as possible, it implemented almost no privacy protections for the Erie County residents it is sworn to protect and serve.
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:27.825]  It was revealed last year that the federal government is using dirt box devices similar to the stingray device to collect data on the unsuspecting population.
[00:03:28.105 --> 00:03:34.390]  The ACLU has identified 50 agencies in 21 states and the District of Columbia that own stingrays.
[00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:52.403]  Again, that warrant requirement.
[00:03:52.423 --> 00:04:06.497]  In a letter to Homeland Security Chief Jay Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder, Senators Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont expressed their concern that no search warrants are obtained when FBI agents use the devices in public.
[00:04:06.798 --> 00:04:09.661]  Police scanner audio obtained by the hacktivist group Anonymous
[00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:15.944]  appeared to reveal that the Chicago police were using a Stingray to intercept phone calls from an Eric Garner protester.
[00:04:16.024 --> 00:04:23.788]  Police departments are now lobbying to get the more powerful $460,000 4G cell phone upgrade known as Hailstorm.
[00:04:24.108 --> 00:04:32.593]  Blocking the current 2G Stingray technology requires you to find the device information in your phone known as WCDMA preferred.
[00:04:32.913 --> 00:04:37.115]  Change that to WCDMA only and the Stingray can't track you.
[00:04:37.455 --> 00:04:41.758]  It's open season on our privacy and Fourth Amendment rights, and we're all paying for it.
[00:04:42.158 --> 00:04:49.342]  We have before us the opportunity to forge, for ourselves and for future generations, a new world order.
[00:04:50.102 --> 00:04:55.926]  A world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations.
[00:04:57.239 --> 00:05:11.316]  When we are successful, and we will be, we have a real chance at this new world order, an order in which a credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the U.S.
[00:05:11.336 --> 00:05:11.496]  founders.
[00:05:11.516 --> 00:05:14.820]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90%
[00:05:16.121 --> 00:05:20.864]  Of what millions of Americans see, hear and read every single day.
[00:05:21.324 --> 00:05:23.045]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:05:23.245 --> 00:05:23.785]  Think about it.
[00:05:24.005 --> 00:05:29.788]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:05:30.028 --> 00:05:30.929]  But on the other hand,
[00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.631]  The Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:05:35.991 --> 00:05:47.755]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:05:48.016 --> 00:05:50.797]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:05:50.977 --> 00:05:53.478]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:05:53.778 --> 00:05:58.220]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.220]  Think about it.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:06.305]  This is Darren McBreen, and I want you to break the matrix at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:06.545 --> 00:06:10.708]  And listen to the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on through your mind.
[00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:18.094]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:07:11.294 --> 00:07:12.295]  The experts are clear.
[00:07:12.615 --> 00:07:19.581]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:07:19.741 --> 00:07:25.987]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:26.007 --> 00:07:29.590]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.631]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:07:33.931 --> 00:07:38.992]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:07:39.253 --> 00:07:40.153]  Not our iodine.
[00:07:40.273 --> 00:07:43.854]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[00:07:44.074 --> 00:07:46.414]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:08:23.001 --> 00:08:27.122]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government.
[00:08:27.442 --> 00:08:33.364]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:36.805]  You still think that jet fuel brought down the World Trade Center?
[00:08:39.945 --> 00:08:41.346]  Does anybody else see a problem here?
[00:08:42.026 --> 00:08:48.107]  If the government has nothing to hide, why are they so afraid to answer a few questions?
[00:08:48.127 --> 00:08:50.108]  This story does not add up.
[00:09:09.747 --> 00:09:14.609]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, the 17th day of April 2015.
[00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:24.352]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and what we're being fed is a steady, massive diet of lies, lies, and still more lies.
[00:09:28.654 --> 00:09:31.235]  And we're putting together a compilation right now.
[00:09:31.335 --> 00:09:32.175]  Rob Dew is.
[00:09:32.195 --> 00:09:34.616]  We're going to be playing coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:09:35.797 --> 00:09:49.008]  of an Indiana, Washington State, and other areas when the police are asked why do you have these MRAPs, these armored vehicles from the Pentagon, they say we need to be able to fight sovereign citizens or libertarians or the Tea Party.
[00:09:51.210 --> 00:10:01.659]  Now just add that to all the training manuals and all the admissions and then we start getting footage from Florida and California and other states this week that we've been airing
[00:10:02.819 --> 00:10:11.741]  And every time we get footage, they're training to attack and beat and arrest and shoot and kill patriots.
[00:10:13.161 --> 00:10:24.764]  And then now we have chilling footage of armed army forces, National Guard, blocking roads in California and marching around, basically commanding the public.
[00:10:24.804 --> 00:10:28.464]  This is what a slow motion martial law scenario looks like.
[00:10:28.504 --> 00:10:29.404]  And I want to explain something.
[00:10:29.945 --> 00:10:31.805]  It isn't that martial law is coming.
[00:10:33.305 --> 00:10:38.053]  We're under a form of martial law when the feds seize the airports and started searching everyone.
[00:10:38.333 --> 00:10:41.899]  We're under martial law when the president dissolves the borders outside of law.
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.063]  We're under tyranny.
[00:10:45.475 --> 00:10:51.819]  When they sign us on to over half the global derivatives debt that is private and not ours.
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.501]  It's 2.2 quadrillion worldwide.
[00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:54.982]  Do the math.
[00:10:55.282 --> 00:11:00.225]  That's over 100 trillion, excuse me, 1,000 trillion.
[00:11:00.245 --> 00:11:03.888]  These numbers are so huge that they say we owe that we have no connection to.
[00:11:04.708 --> 00:11:06.549]  Our real debt is 19 trillion.
[00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:07.510]  That's our debt.
[00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:08.371]  Not
[00:11:09.734 --> 00:11:11.755]  1,100 trillion.
[00:11:12.055 --> 00:11:14.616]  That's half of the 2.2 quadrillion.
[00:11:15.096 --> 00:11:22.218]  Just five years ago, USA Today said that we owed 660-something trillion.
[00:11:22.238 --> 00:11:22.999]  That was our percentage.
[00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:25.179]  But derivatives have only gotten bigger.
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.841]  But our share was 600-plus trillion.
[00:11:30.621 --> 00:11:33.302]  We talk about trillions now where we just round off a few hundred.
[00:11:34.382 --> 00:11:38.864]  This is the world being maneuvered towards total and absolute enslavement
[00:11:40.236 --> 00:11:54.845]  And we have the military in the RAND Corporation and in all their high-level documents that are public admitting they're preparing to take over the states, preparing to basically nationalize labor, preparing to bring us into a North American Union security zone, as it's called.
[00:11:55.705 --> 00:12:01.969]  And they say in the Banff Canada meetings from 2007 that they would have this global transformation by stealth and by crisis.
[00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:09.612]  So, used to we'd have a military drill every week that we would have in the news.
[00:12:09.732 --> 00:12:12.014]  Now it's 20, 30, 40, 50 a day.
[00:12:13.335 --> 00:12:14.496]  It's tanks rolling around.
[00:12:14.616 --> 00:12:15.537]  It's checkpoints.
[00:12:15.657 --> 00:12:17.658]  It's citizens being drug out of cars.
[00:12:17.899 --> 00:12:26.405]  It's National Guard and Army and Marines marching around very aggressively with their hands on their M-16s.
[00:12:26.425 --> 00:12:30.589]  We have the latest footage shot
[00:12:31.852 --> 00:12:34.414]  In Ontario, California by Felipe Soto.
[00:12:34.434 --> 00:12:36.535]  I'd like to get him on and get his take about that.
[00:12:36.555 --> 00:12:49.063]  We've got another California citizen reporter joining us today that shot the footage of the drills that we were told we were barred from, where they're screaming, I'm a citizen, I have rights, I'm a sovereign citizen, then they're clubbed to the ground.
[00:12:51.124 --> 00:13:03.412]  Do you understand every other country in history has ended up falling to criminal elements inside the government that militarize the police and merge the military with the police?
[00:13:03.752 --> 00:13:07.754]  The military fights and kills and breaks things.
[00:13:09.095 --> 00:13:11.677]  The military fights a foreign enemy.
[00:13:12.277 --> 00:13:19.982]  Police keep the peace and are peace officers and report to the local government and bring people in who have been indicted or who there's an arrest warrant out for.
[00:13:21.854 --> 00:13:40.723]  But in this new third world system that we're going into, there is a massive program, no exaggeration, it's got to be 50 times bigger than the Manhattan Project, that they've been keeping quasi-secret because they don't want to have a public debate about militarization of police and all that's happening, and the NSA spying.
[00:13:40.743 --> 00:13:42.704]  So they just deny it, deny it, deny it.
[00:13:42.944 --> 00:13:44.125]  That was in the Guardian yesterday.
[00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.134]  That federal agencies have a policy of lying.
[00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:49.396]  There's no stingray.
[00:13:49.616 --> 00:13:50.617]  There's no NSA.
[00:13:50.838 --> 00:13:52.200]  There's no plan to take your guns.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.403]  There's no gun confiscations happening.
[00:13:54.983 --> 00:13:55.885]  This is not an assault.
[00:13:56.065 --> 00:13:56.806]  This is not an attack.
[00:13:57.227 --> 00:14:00.231]  So we're always debating with them whether it's happening or not.
[00:14:00.251 --> 00:14:01.853]  And they have this moral authority.
[00:14:02.654 --> 00:14:03.875]  There's no helicopters.
[00:14:03.995 --> 00:14:04.936]  There's no drills.
[00:14:04.956 --> 00:14:07.658]  Remember that going on 20 years ago, 15 years ago?
[00:14:07.919 --> 00:14:08.719]  We'd get the footage.
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:17.867]  I'd be attacked on hard copy, on Extra, on CNN, on Fox News, in the Associated Press, local papers.
[00:14:19.889 --> 00:14:30.858]  I would go to these drills and have them break in my hotel room, harass me, try to set me up, just because they didn't want the public to know that they were there federalizing police and training them with the military.
[00:14:31.854 --> 00:14:38.018]  But now it's, of course we are, and we come in peace, but InfoWars, you can't come to our drill.
[00:14:38.158 --> 00:14:41.781]  Well, citizen reporters still go, and you're trying to take on the Tea Party.
[00:14:42.121 --> 00:14:45.864]  Well, I mean, sure, duh, we have all your manuals.
[00:14:47.105 --> 00:14:59.494]  We know, two years ago it comes out, the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp, the Emergency Centers Establishment Act, and the internment resettlement operations for inside the U.S.
[00:15:00.538 --> 00:15:07.461]  You just type in internment resettlement inside the US, re-education camps for Americans, army document, and it was declassified.
[00:15:08.002 --> 00:15:10.163]  They didn't even hide the document.
[00:15:10.343 --> 00:15:20.948]  And it said we'll process you by social security number, we'll put you in a re-education camp, try to give you a job on the outside, this is during collapse, and the troublemakers will be sent to a higher security facility.
[00:15:22.585 --> 00:15:24.605]  But everyone will be sent for re-education.
[00:15:25.286 --> 00:15:29.667]  I mean, that is so over-the-top, ultra-epic.
[00:15:29.807 --> 00:15:32.527]  It's Army Regulation 210-35.
[00:15:35.448 --> 00:15:36.948]  Summary of change.
[00:15:37.528 --> 00:15:40.569]  And then it goes through, your social security numbers, how to break the families up.
[00:15:41.129 --> 00:15:47.771]  And they went on National News, they went, Alex Jones is wrong, it's not for America, thinking you're lazy and won't read the long document.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.381]  Unclassified.
[00:15:49.421 --> 00:15:49.801]  There it is.
[00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:51.642]  On screen for TV viewers.
[00:15:51.983 --> 00:15:53.064]  I'm not trying to scare you.
[00:15:53.084 --> 00:15:53.924]  I want to explain something.
[00:15:55.405 --> 00:15:56.667]  This is already going on.
[00:15:57.387 --> 00:15:59.229]  We already have the biggest prison population in the world.
[00:15:59.469 --> 00:16:00.590]  The borders have been imploded.
[00:16:02.765 --> 00:16:14.355]  I drove through East Austin yesterday and there were just swarms of out-of-work people, of whites, blacks, Hispanics, all looking like zombies, just wandering around with plastic bags in their hands.
[00:16:14.756 --> 00:16:16.958]  Old, young, sitting at bus stops with no jobs.
[00:16:17.458 --> 00:16:18.739]  Guaranteed all on welfare.
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.302]  We have a hundred plus million people on welfare.
[00:16:21.642 --> 00:16:23.824]  The country is a ticking time bomb.
[00:16:25.256 --> 00:16:26.237]  A time bomb!
[00:16:26.737 --> 00:16:28.659]  And you'll say, yeah, good thing the troops are training.
[00:16:28.839 --> 00:16:29.539]  Absolutely!
[00:16:29.799 --> 00:16:33.702]  The globalists create the atmosphere, the economic conditions, the breakdown.
[00:16:34.823 --> 00:16:39.466]  Just shutting down now over a thousand coal power plants in the last ten years.
[00:16:39.947 --> 00:16:43.029]  The acceleration under Obama has more than doubled energy prices.
[00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:46.412]  That one move kept anybody from moving here to build factories.
[00:16:46.652 --> 00:16:49.054]  That one move decimated savings.
[00:16:49.274 --> 00:16:51.916]  That one move bankrupted countless businesses.
[00:16:52.196 --> 00:16:52.696]  That one move
[00:16:56.425 --> 00:16:57.706]  We're under military attack.
[00:16:57.967 --> 00:16:58.888]  We've been conquered.
[00:16:59.128 --> 00:17:00.029]  We've been taken over.
[00:17:00.369 --> 00:17:02.892]  Now you're about to see the mop-up operation.
[00:17:04.533 --> 00:17:13.843]  And how are they going to have troops in every city and town that have already formed relationships with the police chief, the sheriff, and the local government through these Jade Helm operations?
[00:17:14.524 --> 00:17:15.585]  There's a big announcement there.
[00:17:19.286 --> 00:17:21.609]  How are they going to do that?
[00:17:21.689 --> 00:17:32.520]  They're going to stage false flags to demonize us, put the internet selective kill switch in to shut down the blogs, they're in Congress calling anyone on the blog who opposes corruption a terrorist.
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:33.902]  We played the clips yesterday.
[00:17:34.242 --> 00:17:35.683]  You cannot make it up.
[00:17:36.184 --> 00:17:38.787]  We've expected it, we knew it was coming, it appears.
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:40.941]  And I never said this.
[00:17:41.001 --> 00:17:42.702]  I never thought Obama would try to stay in office.
[00:17:43.323 --> 00:17:45.985]  I never said that it would go this quick, because they've already got us.
[00:17:46.766 --> 00:17:49.568]  But they know that people are waking up, so they want to finish us.
[00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:57.555]  And everything I'm seeing shows that they may actually stage imminent false flags and start the Civil War.
[00:17:58.757 --> 00:18:04.882]  Now, if we get really freaked out about this, and really upset about this, and speak out against this, they may be forced to go slower and back off.
[00:18:05.703 --> 00:18:06.784]  But they're testing right now.
[00:18:07.642 --> 00:18:09.843]  The military has the lowest morale ever recorded.
[00:18:10.303 --> 00:18:14.264]  Army morale low despite six-year optimism program.
[00:18:15.364 --> 00:18:19.865]  USA Today, Christians are leaving the military in droves because they've been told they're not welcome.
[00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:21.425]  That's in the news today.
[00:18:22.985 --> 00:18:26.986]  This is a purge, ladies and gentlemen, of anyone that is not a criminal.
[00:18:27.146 --> 00:18:29.507]  You need to understand, this is a takeover.
[00:18:30.629 --> 00:18:35.770]  And I've studied him in Russia, I've studied him in Germany, I've studied him in Cuba, I've studied him going back with Julius Caesar.
[00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:39.371]  And every other mainline historian says we're in deep trouble.
[00:18:39.971 --> 00:18:44.811]  Top Nobel laureate just died and said he's afraid of global fascism and World War III.
[00:18:44.911 --> 00:18:49.612]  I mean, it is red level, people.
[00:18:50.392 --> 00:18:51.733]  Red level.
[00:18:54.293 --> 00:18:55.753]  I have never been more concerned.
[00:18:55.853 --> 00:18:59.134]  I have never been more freaked out.
[00:19:00.544 --> 00:19:01.284]  I mean, this is it.
[00:19:01.885 --> 00:19:08.168]  They are, they have the safety off, their fingers on the trigger for a total takeover, and they are in the final phases of doing it.
[00:19:09.089 --> 00:19:11.950]  I can tell you right now, this is not a drill what we see going on.
[00:19:13.451 --> 00:19:18.234]  Every piece of humet we get in from the citizens out there, you wonderful patriots,
[00:19:19.298 --> 00:19:21.960]  Black, white, hispanic, old, young are sending us video.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:26.284]  It's so wonderful to see us working as a team that is not commanded from any central zone.
[00:19:26.664 --> 00:19:29.166]  It's basically unstoppable without them totally unplugging the internet.
[00:19:29.606 --> 00:19:31.388]  Every move they make, we're tracking it.
[00:19:31.868 --> 00:19:35.871]  But the problem is, every piece of intel comes in and they're trying to take us on.
[00:19:36.212 --> 00:19:37.713]  They're trying to come to our houses and kill us.
[00:19:38.634 --> 00:19:39.214]  If we resist.
[00:19:39.614 --> 00:19:41.196]  If not, we're going to be handed off to
[00:19:42.876 --> 00:19:45.058]  Socialist re-educators in camps.
[00:19:45.198 --> 00:19:46.359]  And I'm just not going, man.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:52.464]  For those people to come in there and try to turn me and make me serve them and make me go out and, you know, lie to people.
[00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:53.205]  I'm just not doing it.
[00:19:54.305 --> 00:19:56.027]  And my name, my family, everything's on the line.
[00:19:56.047 --> 00:19:56.587]  I hope you know that.
[00:19:57.888 --> 00:19:59.350]  But I'm not selling out to these people.
[00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:00.330]  But I'm telling you, it's real.
[00:20:00.671 --> 00:20:01.952]  They're getting ready to go operational.
[00:20:03.837 --> 00:20:05.258]  And you notice the economy's imploding.
[00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:06.758]  They're starting wars.
[00:20:06.818 --> 00:20:08.899]  I mean, all of it's going to hit the fan at once.
[00:20:08.919 --> 00:20:10.179]  It's going to be spectacular.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.360]  We could stop it, though.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:21.884]  From the producers of the multi-award-winning documentary on Noble Lie, Oklahoma City 1995, Freemind Films is proud to announce the release of their third film, Shadow Ring.

[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.400]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:20.242]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds, I lifted weights five days a week, I could swim two, three miles.
[00:21:20.602 --> 00:21:23.503]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[00:21:23.763 --> 00:21:25.324]  I started an access television show.
[00:21:25.724 --> 00:21:30.505]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[00:21:31.105 --> 00:21:33.946]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[00:21:34.486 --> 00:21:40.215]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a Jabba the Hutt.
[00:21:40.555 --> 00:21:45.402]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[00:21:45.823 --> 00:21:50.710]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:58.058]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Group for InfoWarsLife.com, the results were incredible.

[00:22:47.937 --> 00:22:53.880]  And I'm thinking, yeah, 1992 presidential campaign, oh my god, a gun grabber in the White House.

[00:24:33.281 --> 00:24:50.855]  In a moment, I'm going to play the clip from Spokane, Washington.
[00:24:50.895 --> 00:24:52.917]  Another clip from an Indiana Sheriff's Department.
[00:24:54.125 --> 00:24:55.066]  Where they say two things.
[00:24:55.106 --> 00:25:00.351]  They say the NRAPs and the federal training are for veterans and sovereign citizens.
[00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:02.533]  Now, again, I don't need you to tell me that.
[00:25:03.073 --> 00:25:06.777]  I know what your ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, federal brainwashing is.
[00:25:07.397 --> 00:25:12.222]  We've been blowing their operation from the beginning, 20 years on air.
[00:25:13.311 --> 00:25:20.578]  First, we're going to play the clip from Morgan County, Indiana, because I'm glad a listener called in yesterday and said, Alex, they're denying all this is for the patriots.
[00:25:21.378 --> 00:25:23.781]  The police, when they get asked, say, no, it's for you.
[00:25:24.802 --> 00:25:26.743]  We got a lot of people with guns around here.
[00:25:28.145 --> 00:25:29.466]  Do you understand, folks?
[00:25:30.086 --> 00:25:31.808]  They're preparing to implode the economy.
[00:25:31.828 --> 00:25:32.769]  I mean, you think it's bad now.
[00:25:32.829 --> 00:25:33.770]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:25:35.708 --> 00:25:38.830]  But again, they won't implode it unless they think we'll go along with it.
[00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:40.230]  It's not inevitable.
[00:25:40.631 --> 00:25:41.751]  We can still pull out of this.
[00:25:42.331 --> 00:25:46.694]  But the globalists are all moving to a distance before they blow the country up.
[00:25:47.974 --> 00:25:58.260]  Most billionaires have been evacuating to Switzerland, to Iceland of all places, to the Cook Islands, to New Zealand.
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.001]  I've been telling you this for six years, every day.
[00:26:01.461 --> 00:26:04.763]  Now it's in the London Guardian, now it's in the New York Times, now it's in the Jerusalem Post.
[00:26:06.451 --> 00:26:08.171]  All the billionaires have left Israel.
[00:26:09.252 --> 00:26:09.632]  All of them.
[00:26:09.852 --> 00:26:15.573]  Some still have small homes there, but they've officially moved out to Switzerland and England and New Zealand.
[00:26:16.093 --> 00:26:22.035]  The top, I told you, the top movie stars, before it even happened, I told you they were moving by name.
[00:26:24.115 --> 00:26:27.176]  The maker of Titanic, you name it, have moved to New Zealand.
[00:26:28.036 --> 00:26:30.997]  They're all getting back before they blow the country up.
[00:26:34.448 --> 00:26:45.500]  And that's why they're willing to have a civil war here, because they're going to sit offshore while we're in the fire and they're going to roast hot dogs like it's a camp out.
[00:26:46.061 --> 00:26:47.342]  It's funny to the globalists.
[00:26:47.642 --> 00:26:48.844]  They never get their hands dirty.
[00:26:50.367 --> 00:26:55.372]  They're going to sit here while the police and military destroy themselves fighting the American people!
[00:26:55.892 --> 00:27:00.577]  Can you imagine what the patriots, if 1% stand up, are going to do to the military and police?
[00:27:01.338 --> 00:27:03.720]  I hear this military line that we've tracked their ISPs.
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.101]  It's a megaphone.
[00:27:05.482 --> 00:27:06.623]  It's a sock puppet.
[00:27:07.243 --> 00:27:08.525]  Israelis call it megaphone.
[00:27:08.585 --> 00:27:09.846]  Pentagon calls it sock puppet.
[00:27:10.186 --> 00:27:10.967]  Fake computer.
[00:27:11.467 --> 00:27:14.611]  It'll be posted 20 times every 5 seconds on different pages.
[00:27:15.748 --> 00:27:20.733]  And the sock puppet, private companies have them, you know, they'll say, I made a lot of money doing this, working for Google.
[00:27:21.313 --> 00:27:23.696]  Most of it's corporate spam, but a lot of it's government.
[00:27:24.176 --> 00:27:26.498]  And we can track it even back to the PR firms that are doing it.
[00:27:26.518 --> 00:27:27.699]  We've done reports on it.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.863]  And they're in there going, we got hellfire missiles and Apaches, we'll take you all out.
[00:27:32.183 --> 00:27:32.504]  Really?
[00:27:33.064 --> 00:27:34.666]  Did you take the Iraqis out?
[00:27:35.587 --> 00:27:36.568]  How about the Afghanis?
[00:27:38.049 --> 00:27:40.730]  That's a tiny fighting force compared to the American people.
[00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:41.810]  And I'm not looking for this war.
[00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:46.031]  Because if we have this war, we've lost the first major phase.
[00:27:46.391 --> 00:27:47.731]  Winning is not having the war.
[00:27:48.212 --> 00:27:53.973]  Winning is having the states take things back and doing it peacefully, and letting the globalists try a few false flags, but exposing those.
[00:27:54.833 --> 00:27:55.413]  We can beat them.
[00:27:56.654 --> 00:28:05.036]  But I'm telling you, I'm telling you, they want to have the false flag, and then when they try to come get our guns,
[00:28:06.175 --> 00:28:08.175]  They know people are going to start resisting.
[00:28:09.136 --> 00:28:10.116]  And I can't blame people.
[00:28:10.196 --> 00:28:12.156]  You know, they're trying to take you to re-education camp.
[00:28:14.116 --> 00:28:19.037]  And right now they're just coming to talk to you about your guns with knock and talk from Dallas to Boston.
[00:28:19.777 --> 00:28:20.457]  From L.A.
[00:28:20.497 --> 00:28:22.618]  to Miami.
[00:28:22.638 --> 00:28:24.198]  They come and, we want to talk about your guns.
[00:28:24.318 --> 00:28:25.518]  We know, we've seen your Facebook.
[00:28:25.538 --> 00:28:27.359]  You're a libertarian and a veteran.
[00:28:28.199 --> 00:28:30.439]  Now it's, we want you to come down to the thing and talk to us.
[00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:32.479]  They're just getting used to getting in the car and going.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.260]  And then pretty soon the truck pulls up.
[00:28:37.441 --> 00:28:41.064]  And a bunch of 20-year-olds get off with their guns and stack up to come in your house.
[00:28:41.985 --> 00:28:43.486]  Let me tell all those young boys something.
[00:28:44.147 --> 00:28:47.209]  Only in the first phase are you going to have fun killing the vets and people.
[00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:51.693]  Within one day of you pulling this stuff, there's going to be major retaliation.
[00:28:52.454 --> 00:28:52.934]  Major!
[00:28:54.555 --> 00:28:57.398]  When they bust a cap in my head, can you imagine what's going to happen?
[00:28:58.564 --> 00:28:59.304]  That's their plan.
[00:28:59.324 --> 00:29:05.927]  And these pieces of crap are going to sit offshore and laugh the whole time as America tears itself apart.
[00:29:05.947 --> 00:29:07.228]  I'm sick of this crap!
[00:29:08.649 --> 00:29:11.450]  This is serious, people, and we've got to stop it right now!
[00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:13.571]  Are we this dumb?
[00:29:14.793 --> 00:29:20.415]  I'm trying to be controlled here, but let's go out to break with the county in Indiana talking about how it's for veterans.
[00:29:20.435 --> 00:29:20.975]  Here it is.
[00:29:21.015 --> 00:29:24.516]  We really didn't have the violence that we see today.
[00:29:25.317 --> 00:29:30.138]  The weaponry is totally different now than it was in the beginning of my career.
[00:29:30.899 --> 00:29:39.001]  Plus, you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[00:29:39.141 --> 00:29:40.742]  Oregon County Sheriff's Department Commander
[00:29:40.882 --> 00:29:41.562]  That's enough.
[00:29:41.602 --> 00:29:42.283]  We're going to go to break.
[00:29:42.323 --> 00:29:48.044]  Folks, everything he said is a direct Southern Poverty Law Center, globalist, Ford Foundation written script.
[00:29:48.625 --> 00:29:50.745]  There's been no IDs from veterans.
[00:29:50.765 --> 00:29:52.106]  Veterans have one of the lowest crime rates.
[00:29:52.366 --> 00:29:53.386]  They've done nothing wrong.
[00:29:53.886 --> 00:29:57.127]  And there isn't heavier weaponry than there was when he got in law enforcement.
[00:29:57.288 --> 00:29:58.748]  It's all lies.
[00:29:59.248 --> 00:29:59.848]  Lies.
[00:30:00.128 --> 00:30:00.749]  You liar.
[00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:01.649]  We're on the march.
[00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:03.750]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:07.351]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:11.408 --> 00:30:15.772]  We all know of the countless cases where young black men had drugs or guns planted on them by police.
[00:30:16.452 --> 00:30:20.536]  Now the tables have turned by former black police officer Jeffrey Walker from Daily Mail.
[00:30:20.876 --> 00:30:29.783]  A disgraced ex-police officer testifying against his drug squad colleagues acknowledged on Tuesday that he stole drug money, planted evidence, and lied on paperwork too many times to count.
[00:30:29.923 --> 00:30:35.508]  His victims, in his own words, were white college boy khaki pants types who were easy to intimidate.
[00:30:35.768 --> 00:30:39.351]  Now that Mr. Walker is out of a job, maybe he should try his hand at the DEA.
[00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:45.096]  Apparently having wild sex parties and accepting gifts from drug dealers and working with the Sinaloa cartel is no big deal.
[00:30:45.217 --> 00:31:00.350]  DEA head Michelle Leonhardt said, I can't fire, I can't recommend a penalty when asked why she has not fired or revoked the security clearance of agents named in the March 2015 OIG report which included an account of an agent hitting a prostitute in the face with a glass over a money dispute.
[00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:01.251]  So Mr. Walker,
[00:31:01.531 --> 00:31:05.875]  You can probably get a job with the biggest drug dealers on earth and continue your disreputable ways.
[00:31:06.215 --> 00:31:10.740]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com, InfoWars Nightly News, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:15.764]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[00:31:15.924 --> 00:31:19.888]  Introducing the new InfoWarsLife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[00:31:20.068 --> 00:31:23.071]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms
[00:31:23.351 --> 00:31:23.791]  We're good.
[00:31:41.318 --> 00:31:41.918]  Alex Jones here.
[00:31:42.338 --> 00:31:51.360]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.081]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:31:55.381 --> 00:32:03.402]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.

[00:32:11.264 --> 00:32:12.946]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[00:32:13.226 --> 00:32:16.969]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[00:32:17.449 --> 00:32:21.793]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[00:32:21.933 --> 00:32:28.659]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[00:32:29.199 --> 00:32:38.310]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:43.856]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA force, just one of the key compounds.
[00:32:44.056 --> 00:32:51.321]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed listed published studies.

[00:33:14.483 --> 00:33:19.928]  I see a bad moon rising.
[00:33:20.168 --> 00:33:21.349]  I see trouble.
[00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:27.134]  I'll take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:27.475 --> 00:33:32.119]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.144]  It's hard to believe we're here watching the takeover and fall of the republic.
[00:33:38.204 --> 00:33:39.025]  Borders are gone.
[00:33:40.106 --> 00:33:41.207]  Dollars being devalued.
[00:33:42.501 --> 00:33:53.306]  Our tax money is being used to train the military with billions of rounds of ammunition with the police and HUMET citizens on the ground to take on the American people.
[00:33:54.007 --> 00:33:59.829]  We now have the most incredible footage coming up after Joe Biggs leaves us who has his own amazing reports from the Texas border.
[00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:11.435]  They're in the hot zone in El Paso and he's been over the border successfully yesterday finding a large mosque barbed-wired walled compound near where they say there's the ISIS training camp.
[00:34:13.427 --> 00:34:14.207]  And it is a mosque.
[00:34:15.028 --> 00:34:15.748]  It is Middle Eastern.
[00:34:15.788 --> 00:34:16.409]  It has domes.
[00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:19.711]  It has a little prayer tower.
[00:34:22.092 --> 00:34:22.953]  It has a parapet.
[00:34:23.953 --> 00:34:24.894]  That's just on one corner.
[00:34:24.934 --> 00:34:25.634]  It's very large.
[00:34:25.774 --> 00:34:27.375]  Mosque found near reported ISIS base.
[00:34:27.876 --> 00:34:28.816]  Here's the other headlines.
[00:34:28.896 --> 00:34:35.040]  Cameras on southern border capture daily streams of illegals sneaking into U.S., startling images of immigrants with drugs and guns.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.562]  Jeb says legal status for aliens rational and thoughtful.
[00:34:39.323 --> 00:34:41.424]  Yeah, it's part of your dad's New World Order.
[00:34:44.798 --> 00:34:45.639]  Simply amazing.
[00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:58.326]  And then now we have, out of Big Spring City Council, the most amazing group of clips, where they admit that foreign troops in the future will be involved in Jade Helm, that Jade Helm will now happen every year.
[00:35:00.842 --> 00:35:08.625]  They need civilian cooperation to let them secretly stay in barns and houses and to transport them in secret operations.
[00:35:08.865 --> 00:35:17.528]  This is all about creating safe houses and identifying who will work with them during takeovers of different areas that have been identified as resistance zones.
[00:35:17.548 --> 00:35:22.029]  And it's to see which police chiefs and others are going to work with them, which mayors and others are going to work with them.
[00:35:22.369 --> 00:35:23.270]  And I know this because I...
[00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:26.172]  I found out about it from the Chief of Police of San Antonio.
[00:35:26.772 --> 00:35:27.813]  It's in my Police State film.
[00:35:27.833 --> 00:35:28.774]  The interview is online.
[00:35:28.814 --> 00:35:29.675]  The whole film's online.
[00:35:30.095 --> 00:35:30.456]  For free.
[00:35:30.816 --> 00:35:31.296]  Police State 2000.
[00:35:32.297 --> 00:35:33.618]  Where they tried to bribe the police chief.
[00:35:33.638 --> 00:35:35.220]  And they were able to buy off the rest of the city.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.483]  The mayor, the fire department, everybody else took the money.
[00:35:38.503 --> 00:35:39.403]  $200,000 apiece.
[00:35:41.385 --> 00:35:42.186]  And they were corrupted.
[00:35:42.366 --> 00:35:45.048]  And then the next wave came in and they paid them off too.
[00:35:45.929 --> 00:35:46.950]  And that was the big cities.
[00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:48.812]  Now they're getting down to the small towns.
[00:35:50.322 --> 00:35:54.305]  And this is how you take over a third world country, is you come in and buy folks off beforehand.
[00:35:54.566 --> 00:35:57.628]  It's a Nazi model how they took over France with the Vichy.
[00:36:01.712 --> 00:36:03.894]  They were asked how often they have operations like this.
[00:36:03.934 --> 00:36:05.795]  They say it's the first and that'll be every year.
[00:36:05.875 --> 00:36:07.797]  Foreign troops, NATO and DHS.
[00:36:09.278 --> 00:36:13.502]  They go on to say they're going to have people in civilian attire.
[00:36:15.558 --> 00:36:18.660]  The local police are going to be involved, as if this is for overseas.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.082]  And they'll have some dual use in that, but no, it's for America.
[00:36:22.603 --> 00:36:30.267]  And the MRAPs are for America, and I want to go to that clip out of Spokane, where there's the admission that the MRAPs are for the sovereign citizens.
[00:36:30.307 --> 00:36:35.131]  You just heard them in Indiana say it's for the veterans, because they're so violent now with IEDs.
[00:36:35.211 --> 00:36:40.734]  And the feds are telling every department for six years, you will be bombed by veterans, you will fight them, they're the enemy.
[00:36:41.675 --> 00:36:44.697]  So when you get bombed, do you think it's the veterans?
[00:36:47.543 --> 00:36:49.165]  Or the people that told you it was going to happen?
[00:36:49.305 --> 00:36:50.766]  I mean, how obvious is this a frame-up?
[00:36:50.966 --> 00:36:51.527]  Now, don't worry.
[00:36:51.867 --> 00:36:59.534]  Once the Civil War starts, and you've drug veterans' brothers off in people, and killed them in camps, oh, oh yeah!
[00:37:02.057 --> 00:37:03.758]  Then you better be in cattle trailers.
[00:37:03.798 --> 00:37:05.200]  You better be in civilian clothes.
[00:37:07.506 --> 00:37:11.292]  Because the American people are going to come after you, and I have no wish for this to happen.
[00:37:11.913 --> 00:37:15.257]  George Soros and others are going to sit offshore and laugh the whole time.
[00:37:15.638 --> 00:37:17.020]  But we have huge breaking news.
[00:37:17.341 --> 00:37:17.821]  Documents.
[00:37:17.841 --> 00:37:18.262]  This is CNN!
[00:37:21.437 --> 00:37:25.219]  National Guard ordered to consider Americans as enemy forces and adversaries.
[00:37:25.279 --> 00:37:27.560]  Internal briefings read like a strategy for going to war.
[00:37:28.021 --> 00:37:29.161]  What do you think's going on?
[00:37:29.201 --> 00:37:30.062]  That's CNN.
[00:37:30.322 --> 00:37:33.224]  Steve Watson has an article on InfoWars.com breaking it down.
[00:37:33.284 --> 00:37:33.684]  Video.
[00:37:34.144 --> 00:37:37.986]  Armed National Guard troops patrol residential streets of California aggressively.
[00:37:38.006 --> 00:37:48.012]  I mean, they're marching around an aggressive battle formation, blocking traffic arrogantly, with M-16s slung across their breasts, with their hands near the trigger.
[00:37:48.592 --> 00:37:50.053]  They're not slung over their backs, folks.
[00:37:55.461 --> 00:38:05.306]  Man, once a civil war starts, a whole phalanx of 100 National Guard, Marchand, Mill Street, 1776 Lexington and Concord.
[00:38:05.726 --> 00:38:07.507]  My God, it's getting ready to kick off.
[00:38:07.907 --> 00:38:10.629]  And they're going to kick it off, folks, just like Lexington and Concord.
[00:38:11.709 --> 00:38:22.555]  And the National Guard is given the same memos that we got from the Coast Guard yesterday, where they said, prepare for veterans on Veterans Day to start attacking federal installations.
[00:38:26.704 --> 00:38:29.148]  The kickoff will be by them false flagging us.
[00:38:29.889 --> 00:38:32.813]  Then when they attack the Patriots, the Patriots will have to defend.
[00:38:33.173 --> 00:38:36.919]  It'll be spun that we've killed kids and police officers and all this.
[00:38:37.339 --> 00:38:38.621]  Then it all kicks off.
[00:38:38.941 --> 00:38:40.103]  All hell breaks loose.
[00:38:40.464 --> 00:38:42.607]  You will see the rest of the elite leave the country.
[00:38:45.905 --> 00:38:46.845]  Or hide in D.C.
[00:38:47.446 --> 00:38:49.287]  Or hide in the Ozarks in those command bases.
[00:38:49.827 --> 00:38:50.987]  This is the takedown of America.
[00:38:51.007 --> 00:38:53.208]  Look, they're willing to go to war to take over Russia.
[00:38:53.448 --> 00:38:55.169]  Of course they're willing to go to war to take us over.
[00:38:55.469 --> 00:38:56.970]  You're seeing history right now.
[00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:01.232]  Now, former Staff Sergeant of the Army Joe Biggs, who was stationed down
[00:39:02.298 --> 00:39:12.788]  There at Fort Bliss at his last duty station, had great contacts, I'll just leave it at that, was able to get into Mexico with local guides into the most dangerous area, arguably, of Mexico.
[00:39:13.208 --> 00:39:21.676]  There's one area by the Guatemalan border that may be even more dangerous from the maps I've had top university scientists, professors on about the most dangerous areas and written books on it.
[00:39:22.057 --> 00:39:23.958]  That area across from
[00:39:25.678 --> 00:39:30.460]  El Paso has had more than a hundred large mass graves found just the last five years.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.721]  They've been having mass graves going back since I was a kid.
[00:39:32.741 --> 00:39:36.103]  It is probably one of the most dangerous places in the world.
[00:39:37.023 --> 00:39:39.124]  And Joe Biggs was able to get in there for a few hours.
[00:39:39.144 --> 00:39:41.645]  He was able to fly over the day before that.
[00:39:42.205 --> 00:39:42.926]  He was able to get in.
[00:39:44.247 --> 00:39:50.952]  And we have the HD footage up on Infowars.com, also the live stream he did of some very suspicious things.
[00:39:51.273 --> 00:39:58.499]  Just flying over once, we caught white trucks with men marching in black uniforms by what looks like combat simulation areas.
[00:39:59.099 --> 00:40:06.246]  Right down the street, a big pink and green Arabic-style deal, which is very rare in Mexico.
[00:40:07.793 --> 00:40:14.098]  You could say Mexico is almost Islamophobic, obviously because that's from a Spanish culture who dealt with the Moors invading repeatedly.
[00:40:14.118 --> 00:40:21.003]  And that was what the La Reconquista originally was, was the Spanish taking Spain back with a big European force that came in to help them.
[00:40:22.904 --> 00:40:25.485]  That's why the Spanish used to be blonde-haired, blue-eyed, looked like Germans.
[00:40:25.505 --> 00:40:31.689]  They were basically almost a Germanic group, basically, until they got taken over by North Africans, so it's now an interesting hybrid.
[00:40:32.269 --> 00:40:33.450]  But that's just some history for you.
[00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:50.299]  We're showing HD footage, Joe Big's shot, of the, what is that, about a 12, 14-foot wall, barbed wire up on the top, spikes, looks like minarets, watchtowers, Constantino wire,
[00:40:51.752 --> 00:40:53.213]  We need to investigate this further.
[00:40:53.253 --> 00:40:54.274]  Joe Biggs joins us.
[00:40:54.574 --> 00:40:56.115]  Great job, compadre.
[00:40:56.875 --> 00:40:58.376]  Break down what happened, Joe Biggs.
[00:40:58.396 --> 00:40:59.257]  Tell us where you're at right now.
[00:41:00.231 --> 00:41:01.632]  Joe Biggs here, InfoWars.com.
[00:41:01.652 --> 00:41:05.953]  We're actually at the base of the Franklin Mountains, the far west side of El Paso, Texas.
[00:41:06.613 --> 00:41:08.934]  Yeah, yesterday was pretty intense, to say the least.
[00:41:08.994 --> 00:41:19.557]  I've done some crazy things in my life, and going into Annapurna, which is probably one of the most dangerous cities in the world, without a gun, without any kind of protection, in a truck with U.S.
[00:41:19.597 --> 00:41:24.179]  plates that was a pretty shiny truck that sticks out like a sore thumb.
[00:41:24.739 --> 00:41:28.040]  If I would have sat on a lump of coal, it would have been a diamond pretty quick.
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.761]  Well, did y'all break down Moababla?
[00:41:31.541 --> 00:41:32.822]  Break down Moababla, what happened?
[00:41:34.182 --> 00:41:39.685]  So we get over the border and when you get over the border it's like you completely just flip and go to the other side of the world.
[00:41:40.225 --> 00:41:46.067]  I mean as soon as I was 200 yards away from the border I've never felt so far away from America in my entire life.
[00:41:46.127 --> 00:41:51.930]  I mean Juarez is just this crazy booming little city where everyone's just moving a million miles an hour.
[00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.271]  And it's not what you would expect.
[00:41:54.331 --> 00:42:01.435]  I mean, the cartel wars have definitely simmered down in Juarez, but as we made our way into Annapurna, that's a whole different story.
[00:42:01.495 --> 00:42:08.059]  That is completely ran by the cartels, the Mexican military, and there's five different types of police in that area.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:13.583]  From what my buddy Anthony was telling me, the guy who drove me in, and you don't know who's bought out by the cartels.
[00:42:13.883 --> 00:42:27.343]  You see spotters standing on the side of the road just hanging out in the middle of nowhere with a cell phone and they're just watching and the biggest thing you have to do when you're out there is not raise any kind of suspicion because as soon as one of those spotters sees you, calls it in as suspicious, the cartel's gonna...
[00:42:28.804 --> 00:42:35.550]  So it was very intense, and once we got on the ground, you're able to see a lot of these compound-style buildings that I saw over in Iraq.
[00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:38.953]  I mean, the entire place itself looks much like Iraq.
[00:42:39.014 --> 00:42:40.795]  Trash everywhere, desolate.
[00:42:40.835 --> 00:42:42.217]  I mean, it's just horrible.
[00:42:42.277 --> 00:42:46.441]  Dead animals with rigor mortis just all over the side of the road, puddles of blood.
[00:42:46.461 --> 00:42:52.647]  I mean, it was a very intense atmosphere to be in, and it's definitely an area that ISIS would feel comfortable in.
[00:42:53.007 --> 00:42:54.107]  Let's get into this facility.
[00:42:54.147 --> 00:43:01.589]  I know you found some other interesting areas, but you pointed out yesterday that in Afghanistan you didn't know that a mile away was a major Taliban
[00:43:17.475 --> 00:43:21.277]  Training base that was launching attacks on you because it had these big walls around it.
[00:43:21.297 --> 00:43:21.557]  Exactly.
[00:43:21.597 --> 00:43:22.877]  Until there was reconnaissance flights.
[00:43:23.238 --> 00:43:24.358]  So it's really hard.
[00:43:24.778 --> 00:43:27.940]  People are like expecting you who went in to instantly find it.
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:39.225]  We're just trying to draw attention so that government and others get involved to actually, you know, force people to look into this because the FBI, South Com have all said Al Qaeda, ISIS is in the area.
[00:43:40.523 --> 00:43:41.103]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:41.123 --> 00:43:45.786]  I mean, it would take multiple trips to get in there and try to find out what's going on.
[00:43:45.826 --> 00:43:49.968]  I mean, we spoke to one gentleman yesterday who worked for the city of Waterloo.
[00:43:49.988 --> 00:43:51.469]  He had a little emblem up on his shirt.
[00:43:51.969 --> 00:43:55.211]  And we asked him if he knew any Muslims and he's like, no, no, no, I don't know anything about that.
[00:43:55.611 --> 00:43:57.592]  And then as we started to pull away, he laughed.
[00:43:57.612 --> 00:43:59.493]  He goes, if I did, I wouldn't tell you.
[00:44:00.614 --> 00:44:05.076]  So, you know, there's some people who are acting a little strange over there, but, you know, that's expected.
[00:44:06.331 --> 00:44:11.538]  I didn't expect to see any, like, large ISIS flags waving around in the area because that would definitely set off, uh...
[00:44:12.694 --> 00:44:18.715]  You know, suspicion for the locals in that area as well, and I don't really see them being very welcoming to that kind of activity.
[00:44:18.795 --> 00:44:32.018]  Well, I've been in Juarez, you know, 20 years ago before it really got bad, and I've been around that area as well, and I've been, you know, Boquillas, I mean, just all over the entire border, Brownsville, into Mexico, across there.
[00:44:32.038 --> 00:44:35.259]  I've never seen something that looks like a mosque.
[00:44:35.779 --> 00:44:37.159]  Did you ask locals anything?
[00:44:37.199 --> 00:44:38.999]  I mean, what did your guides say?
[00:44:39.019 --> 00:44:39.960]  I mean, that looked Arabic 100%.
[00:44:42.569 --> 00:44:43.770]  Oh yeah, I mean, that's what my guide said.
[00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:46.313]  I mean, he spotted it and he goes, whoa, that's weird.
[00:44:46.333 --> 00:44:46.754]  That's weird.
[00:44:46.794 --> 00:44:47.594]  And he drove over there.
[00:44:47.614 --> 00:44:56.244]  I mean, when he was a teenager, for them to try to prove that they were, uh, like really tough or hard, they would try to drive into an opera and stay there the longest.
[00:44:56.524 --> 00:45:00.548]  And whoever stayed there the longest was deemed, you know, like a really hardcore type of kid.
[00:45:00.568 --> 00:45:02.270]  So that kind of gives you the atmosphere of that place.
[00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:03.872]  And he said, that's something that's very.
[00:45:04.312 --> 00:45:06.694]  Well, it looks like there's cameras on the building as well.
[00:45:06.714 --> 00:45:07.394]  Yeah, yeah, I saw that.
[00:45:07.414 --> 00:45:09.415]  And then it looks like they're building some more minarets.
[00:45:09.435 --> 00:45:10.636]  I see constructions going on inside.
[00:45:27.162 --> 00:45:27.782]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:27.822 --> 00:45:29.263]  I definitely saw some cameras out there.
[00:45:29.663 --> 00:45:30.984]  That area is just so desolate.
[00:45:31.024 --> 00:45:38.588]  I mean, if someone wanted to go in there and infiltrate that area and stay low-key in those areas and set up a base camp, it would be 100% possible, without a doubt.
[00:45:39.889 --> 00:45:47.494]  How many square foot would you say the building is, just guesstimating, and versus, it looks like there's a larger compound around it, and it looked like the walls are 12 to 14 feet?
[00:45:47.534 --> 00:45:49.695]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:45:49.715 --> 00:45:51.316]  Somewhere around that size.
[00:45:51.416 --> 00:45:54.978]  It's about the size of, like, three
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:57.701]  Nice size homes in Austin.
[00:45:58.001 --> 00:45:59.182]  I mean, it's a pretty big area.
[00:46:01.624 --> 00:46:03.205]  It's very, very bizarre.
[00:46:04.406 --> 00:46:06.287]  Well, Joe, great job going in there.
[00:46:06.967 --> 00:46:08.708]  They're continuing to try to whitewash the whole thing.
[00:46:08.729 --> 00:46:20.797]  I know you're going to the New Mexico area, you may already be there, and you're going to investigate those mountains where the Mexican authorities have told the federal government and Judicial Watch that they have spotted ISIS with spotters
[00:46:21.698 --> 00:46:24.341]  Who are now doing coyote operations, which are very lucrative.
[00:46:24.382 --> 00:46:29.749]  We know ISIS is involved in all sorts of criminal operations, trafficking in the Middle East and Africa.
[00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:34.837]  They're reportedly trafficking Arabs just to make money into the country, not even so much terrorists.
[00:46:35.862 --> 00:46:44.544]  Well, the interesting thing about the part where we're at yesterday, Josh was on the other side of the border, and he was at the Crystal Ray Mountain Range, where there's a big cross on top.
[00:46:45.124 --> 00:46:59.607]  On the other side of that is Annapurna, and we spoke to the Border Patrol yesterday, or he did, I should say, and he said that in that area, there was, it was probably the largest crossing point for illegals from that area into here.
[00:47:00.547 --> 00:47:02.707]  And he said there's these deep crevices everywhere.
[00:47:02.727 --> 00:47:05.728]  You can see an officer just gave us a ticket for parking on the side of the road right here.
[00:47:06.653 --> 00:47:10.556]  This guy just came up and gave us a ticket and a second ago a cop just went by and said we were okay.
[00:47:13.218 --> 00:47:14.799]  Wait a minute, he actually gave you a ticket?
[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:15.780]  Yeah, he just sat there.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:16.441]  He didn't say anything.
[00:47:16.481 --> 00:47:19.263]  He just put a ticket on the front dashboard of the vehicle.
[00:47:19.283 --> 00:47:27.009]  So in America, they order the Border Patrol to let the illegals come across and to give them vouchers and to pay for everything, let them drunk drive.
[00:47:27.029 --> 00:47:28.570]  That's mainstream news, CBS News.
[00:47:29.531 --> 00:47:33.255]  Was that federal or was that park service?
[00:47:33.675 --> 00:47:35.197]  He's like a park police officer.
[00:47:35.237 --> 00:47:36.378]  I'm just going to take it and throw it up.
[00:47:36.498 --> 00:47:37.459]  I mean, that's just ridiculous.
[00:47:37.539 --> 00:47:40.022]  I would follow him and I bet they flip out and say, what are you doing?
[00:47:40.062 --> 00:47:42.644]  Give me a ticket for parking on the side of a dirt road.
[00:47:42.724 --> 00:47:44.326]  I mean, what planet are these people on?
[00:47:46.007 --> 00:47:50.272]  You see, you're a citizen, though, with plates.
[00:47:50.772 --> 00:47:53.375]  I mean, the border patrol was down here yesterday telling Josh that, hey,
[00:47:54.181 --> 00:47:59.803]  There's tons of illegals who come through in this one area where I was at on the other side because there's no border fence whatsoever.
[00:48:00.083 --> 00:48:05.065]  They come through these deep crevices and walk through hideouts, easy to not be seen.
[00:48:05.085 --> 00:48:10.367]  And he said it's not unusual that at night time you'll hear gunfire out there and just tons of people coming through in that area.
[00:48:10.387 --> 00:48:13.488]  He said that is the most crawled spot in all of the border.
[00:48:14.128 --> 00:48:18.612]  That's right, and when they don't pay up fully, the coyotes kill them and put them in a mass grave.
[00:48:19.093 --> 00:48:23.977]  And then Robert Rodriguez makes a movie where white people are the ones killing them and putting them in mass graves.
[00:48:24.017 --> 00:48:24.818]  But you know what?
[00:48:24.858 --> 00:48:26.039]  It wasn't any white people.
[00:48:26.059 --> 00:48:27.140]  It wasn't Don Johnson.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.922]  It's the coyotes killing the people and putting them in the graves.
[00:48:29.942 --> 00:48:31.363]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:32.064 --> 00:48:33.685]  But Robert Rodriguez says it's not.
[00:48:33.705 --> 00:48:34.806]  He says it's you, Joe, basically.
[00:48:35.467 --> 00:48:36.148]  Yeah, it's me.
[00:48:36.208 --> 00:48:36.868]  I'm the bad guy.
[00:48:37.549 --> 00:48:38.330]  I'm the veteran.
[00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:39.751]  You just got given a ticket.
[00:48:41.613 --> 00:48:43.755]  What do you make now of even CNN?
[00:48:43.995 --> 00:48:44.415]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:48:45.256 --> 00:48:49.259]  And apparently, because I used to be in the military, I know how to make IEDs.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.181]  That's pretty much preposterous.
[00:48:51.621 --> 00:48:54.624]  I mean, I have just as much knowledge in building IEDs as
[00:48:55.185 --> 00:48:56.846]  You know, Martha Stewart does.
[00:48:56.886 --> 00:48:58.847]  I mean, that's something I didn't do in the military.
[00:48:59.167 --> 00:49:00.728]  That's something the EOD would do.
[00:49:00.748 --> 00:49:02.629]  Well, they're not branding you as Al Qaeda.
[00:49:02.989 --> 00:49:07.831]  And CNN's even come out and said National Guard ordered to consider Americans as enemy forces.
[00:49:08.251 --> 00:49:14.094]  And I just played clips where they're saying they need to have armored vehicles to fight veterans, Joe.
[00:49:15.074 --> 00:49:15.915]  Because you're going to bomb them.
[00:49:16.877 --> 00:49:21.444]  Yeah, like I said, it's just so mind-blowing to hear something like that.
[00:49:21.464 --> 00:49:23.087]  I have no intentions of ever doing that.
[00:49:23.447 --> 00:49:28.495]  I don't know any men who ever served in the military or women who have those kind of intentions.
[00:49:28.695 --> 00:49:32.000]  I'm a proud American, but I am definitely disappointed with my government, I'll say that.
[00:49:32.481 --> 00:49:47.737]  Well it's an illegitimate government 110% and Jade Helm, we have major intel now from city council meetings where they admitted that it's going to be every year they plan on foreign troops later and that they're going to be basically in cattle trailers and working with citizens and police
[00:49:48.337 --> 00:49:57.662]  This is just to prepare us to have permanent military forces in plain clothes, involved in seek-and-destroy and snatch-and-grab operations, Joe.
[00:49:57.682 --> 00:50:06.246]  We have this from Florida, Texas, and California, and now National Guard, with their M-16s, marching aggressively through the streets of California, directing traffic.
[00:50:07.267 --> 00:50:08.487]  I mean, just think about this, Alex.
[00:50:08.547 --> 00:50:12.789]  If we wouldn't have brought this to the attention of the American people, where would we be at right now?
[00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:17.792]  Most people wouldn't even know this Jade Helm exercise even existed, except for a small little group of people
[00:50:18.379 --> 00:50:28.306]  You know, looking at that stuff on the internet, very small, now this is nationwide, worldwide, people know about this, we brought attention to this, and now all this information is starting to come to the service.
[00:50:28.326 --> 00:50:40.414]  I mean, this is mind-blowing to find out that all these different National Guard units are saying they're doing dirty bomb exercises, when in actuality they're trying to take on, you know, constitutionalist sovereign citizens, patriots.
[00:50:40.434 --> 00:50:43.256]  I mean, this is just mind-blowing to know that
[00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:49.404]  This 1083 program, they're bringing in all these MRAPs to patrol the streets.
[00:50:49.464 --> 00:50:50.705]  I mean, this is just crazy!
[00:50:51.165 --> 00:50:53.426]  They're getting ready for something ultra-gigantic.
[00:50:54.007 --> 00:50:58.369]  Joe, we'll get updates on the nightly news and the live reports you're filing at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:58.789 --> 00:50:59.870]  Godspeed, great job.
[00:51:01.131 --> 00:51:04.653]  We're going to come back with some of these city council clips from Big Spring, Texas.
[00:51:04.673 --> 00:51:09.796]  I mean, this is the biggest military operation domestically ever, folks, and it's to take on the Patriots.
[00:51:11.431 --> 00:51:20.677]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:51:20.737 --> 00:51:21.477]  This capitalism?
[00:51:21.537 --> 00:51:27.641]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[00:53:10.501 --> 00:53:13.903]  Last year, in the Nevada desert, one family took a stand for freedom.
[00:53:14.344 --> 00:53:18.627]  Numana Food Storage was the first and only company to support the rights of the Bundys.
[00:53:18.847 --> 00:53:24.731]  While others stood down, Numana took donations and provided storable foods to the men at Bunkerville.

[00:53:41.893 --> 00:53:46.135]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:53:47.275 --> 00:53:49.657]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:53:50.217 --> 00:53:53.279]  You can prevent being the next victim of a break-in.

[00:54:13.973 --> 00:54:15.355]  I don't live in a fantasy world.
[00:54:16.197 --> 00:54:18.961]  You go watch Star Wars and see rebels fighting an evil empire.
[00:54:19.582 --> 00:54:23.729]  We're in the real world with foreign megabanks who are eugenicists taking over this country.
[00:54:25.732 --> 00:54:26.233]  Next hour...
[00:54:27.273 --> 00:54:39.763]  I'm going to go through a city council meeting in Big Spring and play these clips where you begin to learn exactly what's happening with the new annual exercises that will just phase us into a permanent military on the street with the citizen spies working with them.
[00:54:40.444 --> 00:54:46.969]  Rob Dewey put together a compilation of government admitting that the MRAPs and all of this are for the American people.
[00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.490]  Here it is.
[00:54:48.433 --> 00:54:55.478]  Well, conspiracy theories are running wild tonight about the Army's plan for a multi-state training exercise this summer called Jade Helm 15.
[00:54:56.038 --> 00:55:02.742]  While the military says it's just training soldiers for the realities of war, critics say the Army is preparing for modern-day martial law.
[00:55:02.923 --> 00:55:06.505]  We really didn't have the violence that we see today.
[00:55:07.285 --> 00:55:07.926]  The weaponry is
[00:55:08.166 --> 00:55:12.170]  It's totally different now than it was in the beginning of my career.
[00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:12.851]  That's Indiana.
[00:55:12.911 --> 00:55:18.537]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs.
[00:55:18.577 --> 00:55:19.638]  They've done nothing and you blame them?
[00:55:19.659 --> 00:55:21.080]  And to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:26.466]  In video of them two days ago, training to attack sovereign citizens.
[00:55:36.301 --> 00:55:38.463]  I'm a sovereign citizen.
[00:55:38.543 --> 00:55:40.404]  I refuse to recognize you guys.
[00:55:40.625 --> 00:55:42.846]  That was interesting.
[00:55:48.817 --> 00:55:58.824]  The nice thing about this piece of equipment is that if somebody is directing fire toward a team that's trying to get in, they can safely pull right up to a friend.
[00:55:58.944 --> 00:56:04.568]  I don't think you can take enemy fire and still try to address a threat without being sure you're getting shot.
[00:56:04.828 --> 00:56:09.472]  So I'm thinking that is totally appropriate in Iraq, but what kind of a situation in the U.S.
[00:56:09.512 --> 00:56:10.512]  would you see that happening?
[00:56:10.573 --> 00:56:15.796]  I mean, we've got a lot of constitutionalists, a lot of people that stockpile weapons, a lot of ammunition.
[00:56:17.277 --> 00:56:21.578]  I mean, we've got a lot of constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[00:56:22.278 --> 00:56:23.278]  A lot of ammunition.
[00:56:23.338 --> 00:56:26.679]  They have weapons here locally.
[00:56:26.939 --> 00:56:28.559]  So what happens if the PLR take over?
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:30.880]  A country run by terrorists ain't good.
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:34.901]  Bro, America was founded by terrorists for terrorists.
[00:56:34.941 --> 00:56:37.941]  What do you think the revolutionary war was?
[00:56:38.321 --> 00:56:41.642]  The mystery is determined by the victim.
[00:56:41.682 --> 00:56:43.402]  How did you even get into the Marines?
[00:56:43.662 --> 00:56:46.023]  Who was the first terrorist organization in the United States?
[00:56:55.129 --> 00:56:56.050]  George Washington?
[00:56:56.650 --> 00:56:57.291]  Paul McGarrett?
[00:56:58.332 --> 00:57:02.375]  These guys right here, can we ask you something?
[00:57:02.415 --> 00:57:04.917]  Did they try to scare people?
[00:57:05.517 --> 00:57:07.539]  They tried to intimidate the press?
[00:57:07.619 --> 00:57:09.701]  Did they use acts of violence?
[00:57:09.741 --> 00:57:15.165]  Your founding fathers, my founding fathers, were involved in acts of terrorism against British officials.
[00:57:16.226 --> 00:57:19.647]  Jade Helm troops to operate undetected amongst civilian population.
[00:57:20.187 --> 00:57:22.668]  And of course, the military people and the vets are not buying any of it.
[00:57:22.688 --> 00:57:23.288]  They're not stupid.
[00:57:23.608 --> 00:57:29.330]  You can read about how it's to get the hearts and minds and how to get the public used to working and the local police working with the military.
[00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:35.692]  I mean, everybody who's been in the military knows about the secret EOD program going on for 18 years.
[00:57:36.113 --> 00:57:40.254]  Their whole ordinance disposal, you know, quote, the army is going to show up to defuse a bomb.
[00:57:41.075 --> 00:57:43.036]  But then you get the internal agreements.
[00:57:43.156 --> 00:57:50.798]  It's for everything from warrant service to checkpoints with military personnel in nondescript blue jumpsuits.
[00:57:50.958 --> 00:57:55.619]  Just like the Army Ranger called in and said they were wearing EPA blue jumpsuits.
[00:57:55.719 --> 00:57:58.480]  It's always blue or tan jumpsuits.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:00.941]  And it might say EPA.
[00:58:01.061 --> 00:58:02.241]  It might say police.
[00:58:03.261 --> 00:58:04.562]  It might say park sergeants.
[00:58:05.542 --> 00:58:23.921]  Training with the police, training with locals, in plain clothes, quote, doing suspicious activities, is to train the police to work with the military in covert operations, and to condition the military to accept it, and to condition the public to accept it, and then when we cover it and talk about it, they practice the PSYOP in real time, putting out this information.
[00:58:23.981 --> 00:58:25.702]  I can see the script from Army Times.
[00:58:26.872 --> 00:58:35.341]  To Military.com, to Stars and Stripes, to Bloomberg, to Daily Beast, to Vice, to the Houston Chronicle, and no exaggeration today.
[00:58:37.343 --> 00:58:39.205]  You go search Jade Helm.
[00:58:42.113 --> 00:58:46.796]  There are now hundreds of articles, and in almost all of them, yours truly is being demonized.
[00:58:47.136 --> 00:58:54.040]  Jones, who's warned of an imminent takeover for decades, keeps claiming it's going to happen, but of course it never does.
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:55.781]  No, it never does!
[00:58:56.181 --> 00:58:56.921]  Checkpoints!
[00:58:57.201 --> 00:58:58.082]  TSA!
[00:58:58.462 --> 00:58:59.143]  Open spy!
[00:58:59.163 --> 00:58:59.603]  We'll be back!

[01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:24.591]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:25.231 --> 01:00:28.853]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:29.433 --> 01:00:33.515]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.735 --> 01:00:37.357]  Alright, we're into the second hour.
[01:00:39.298 --> 01:00:46.682]  I had a bunch of guests scheduled today, but I just moved one of them to the Sunday broadcast because there's just too much news to cover.
[01:00:48.404 --> 01:00:49.865]  You already had Joe Biggs on from the border.
[01:00:51.506 --> 01:01:07.375]  Keith Johnson, citizen reporter, is going to be joining us at the start of the next hour, who's been shooting video of the hundreds and hundreds, almost a thousand people showing up at the Statehouse, saying no to forced inoculation and then stopping the vote for a while.
[01:01:08.996 --> 01:01:11.418]  Walter E. Williams, who's only been on the show one time,
[01:01:12.844 --> 01:01:15.265]  He's scheduled to be on today for 30 minutes.
[01:01:15.545 --> 01:01:22.326]  He's hosted Rush Limbaugh's program, best-selling author, really an amazing libertarian slash conservative philosopher.
[01:01:22.366 --> 01:01:28.728]  Look forward to Walter E. Williams joining us to talk about what's happening with race relations in America.
[01:01:30.288 --> 01:01:34.089]  So, Keith Johnson and Walter E. Williams are coming up.
[01:01:35.249 --> 01:01:39.410]  This next hour, I want to really drill into Jade Helm.
[01:01:41.383 --> 01:01:43.565]  And explain the continuum of what's happening.
[01:01:44.225 --> 01:01:46.667]  I'm going to do that in the next segment of the City Council Clips.
[01:01:46.747 --> 01:01:52.252]  Then I'm going to shift gears and get into all the news that's on InfoWars.com and DrudgeReport.com.
[01:01:52.853 --> 01:01:53.773]  And there is a lot.
[01:01:53.813 --> 01:02:09.987]  I say Drudge Report because it's what I'm looking at right now and it is just jam-packed with over-the-top developments with the stock market, with the former head of the IMF indicted for tax evasion.
[01:02:12.699 --> 01:02:15.141]  I mean, it's just so much stuff is happening.
[01:02:15.962 --> 01:02:16.602]  Look at these headlines.
[01:02:16.662 --> 01:02:18.704]  Local police launch drones into the skies.
[01:02:18.744 --> 01:02:20.446]  You're not going to detect because it's so quiet.
[01:02:20.466 --> 01:02:23.749]  Remember, they said, oh, we'll never have drones just four years ago, and I was a liar.
[01:02:23.769 --> 01:02:26.411]  There's nothing going on.
[01:02:26.471 --> 01:02:27.051]  Don't listen to him.
[01:02:27.071 --> 01:02:28.132]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:02:31.095 --> 01:02:36.279]  Shock, new videos of Michelle O food that's even worse than prisoner food.
[01:02:37.108 --> 01:02:38.349]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:40.991]  Jitters as World Stock Index is rocked.
[01:02:41.592 --> 01:02:44.053]  Looming Greek crunch threatens fresh global crisis.
[01:02:45.314 --> 01:02:47.476]  Greece starts asset sales.
[01:02:47.696 --> 01:02:51.539]  IRS, Texas businessman, brother, owe more than $3 billion in taxes.
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:54.201]  Former IMF head arrested for tax fraud.
[01:02:55.662 --> 01:02:58.605]  Former TSA screener says Grop plot was just a game.
[01:03:02.577 --> 01:03:06.819]  Physicians demand removal of Dr. Oz from Columbia U facility.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.982]  Saying he's a quack because he's criticized vaccines and Monsanto.
[01:03:11.102 --> 01:03:12.002]  That's the persecution.
[01:03:13.063 --> 01:03:13.723]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:03:13.743 --> 01:03:15.124]  There's a battle for people's free speech.
[01:03:15.444 --> 01:03:16.544]  The force is awakening.
[01:03:16.565 --> 01:03:17.305]  We have a new trailer.
[01:03:19.486 --> 01:03:20.907]  All the real wars going on around us.
[01:03:23.468 --> 01:03:25.689]  DC restaurant pairs menu with pot.
[01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:27.250]  This is big news.
[01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:29.752]  Citibank economists time to abolish cash.
[01:03:29.872 --> 01:03:30.192]  Oh yeah.
[01:03:31.209 --> 01:03:34.191]  Walmart suddenly closes five stores, lays off thousands of workers.
[01:03:34.731 --> 01:03:37.914]  Same stores that protested for higher pay.
[01:03:37.994 --> 01:03:39.154]  Yeah, I think Drudge gets it.
[01:03:39.194 --> 01:03:40.015]  I said that on Monday.
[01:03:40.215 --> 01:03:45.779]  I think this is a shot across the bow to the unions.
[01:03:46.219 --> 01:03:47.880]  Trying to unionize Gawker right now.
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:48.981]  Hey, you're social.
[01:03:49.001 --> 01:03:49.782]  Let's go ahead and unionize.
[01:03:51.643 --> 01:03:53.384]  That's just some of the news right there.
[01:03:54.465 --> 01:03:55.926]  Look at this video I want to play.
[01:03:56.606 --> 01:03:59.068]  Students support Hillary just because she's a woman.
[01:04:00.896 --> 01:04:05.760]  And let's go ahead and play that disgusting video at the University of Washington.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.180]  Here it is.
[01:04:06.561 --> 01:04:12.546]  Don't you someday want to see a woman president of the United States of America?
[01:04:12.566 --> 01:04:13.586]  Are you really a woman?
[01:04:13.747 --> 01:04:17.209]  Well... I think she's a transgender.
[01:04:17.530 --> 01:04:18.590]  Are you ready for Hillary?
[01:04:19.271 --> 01:04:20.352]  Yes, all the way.
[01:04:20.372 --> 01:04:21.473]  Hillary Clinton, 2016.
[01:04:21.513 --> 01:04:22.874]  Look at those helpless people.
[01:04:22.974 --> 01:04:24.195]  Are you ready for Hillary?
[01:04:25.296 --> 01:04:25.596]  Yes.
[01:04:26.137 --> 01:04:26.557]  You are?
[01:04:26.877 --> 01:04:27.137]  Yes.
[01:04:27.538 --> 01:04:28.779]  Okay, why are you ready for Hillary?
[01:04:30.362 --> 01:04:32.605]  We need a woman president.
[01:04:32.925 --> 01:04:36.029]  So you're voting for the president based on sex?
[01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:37.491]  Alone?
[01:04:37.591 --> 01:04:37.791]  No.
[01:04:38.051 --> 01:04:39.333]  Okay.
[01:04:39.373 --> 01:04:41.355]  That was a simple answer.
[01:04:41.375 --> 01:04:41.756]  Okay.
[01:04:41.796 --> 01:04:42.997]  Give me the more intelligent answer.
[01:04:43.378 --> 01:04:45.280]  Now that's good advice.
[01:04:46.161 --> 01:04:49.105]  Tell me the one reason why you would support Hillary Clinton presidency.
[01:04:50.246 --> 01:04:51.547]  Um, she's a woman, so.
[01:04:51.807 --> 01:04:53.188]  They asked, why would you support Obama?
[01:04:53.228 --> 01:04:53.688]  He's black!
[01:04:53.708 --> 01:04:54.149]  He's black!
[01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:55.229]  Hashtag diversity.
[01:04:55.369 --> 01:04:55.750]  Yes.
[01:04:56.410 --> 01:04:59.892]  What is the number one reason why you support Hillary Clinton's presidency?
[01:05:00.593 --> 01:05:03.235]  Um, to be honest, it's because she's a female.
[01:05:03.335 --> 01:05:04.495]  I know that's like kind of nice.
[01:05:04.515 --> 01:05:05.876]  That's just incredibly shallow.
[01:05:05.956 --> 01:05:06.757]  He's like not different.
[01:05:06.797 --> 01:05:07.597]  You're the boyfriend nod.
[01:05:07.657 --> 01:05:10.199]  Biggest reason you're going to be voting for Hillary in 2016.
[01:05:10.259 --> 01:05:11.000]  Pathetic.
[01:05:12.601 --> 01:05:17.344]  There's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now.
[01:05:18.078 --> 01:05:22.919]  And if you're wondering how on earth we ever got in this situation, well I'll tell you how.
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:28.961]  When the Democrats showed their true colors, you got angry and you elected Republicans.
[01:05:29.481 --> 01:05:34.723]  And then when the Republicans showed their true colors, you got angry and elected Democrats.
[01:05:35.163 --> 01:05:45.251]  And when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt and that neither side were looking out for your best interest, you acted like they were crazy.
[01:05:45.832 --> 01:05:53.558]  But the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
[01:05:54.058 --> 01:05:59.863]  That's why it is vitally important that you wake up, America, and break the matrix.
[01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:05.248]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:05.688 --> 01:06:08.090]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:06:11.373 --> 01:06:20.621]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[01:06:20.861 --> 01:06:25.465]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[01:06:25.546 --> 01:06:27.067]  It is produced by extracting oil.
[01:06:27.227 --> 01:06:27.387]  I think?
[01:06:46.886 --> 01:06:47.566]  I want more candy!
[01:06:47.627 --> 01:06:48.727]  I want more video games!
[01:06:48.968 --> 01:06:49.068]  Why?
[01:06:49.108 --> 01:06:49.208]  Why?
[01:06:49.268 --> 01:06:49.388]  Why?
[01:07:14.326 --> 01:07:23.710]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:26.591]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:07:26.751 --> 01:07:30.133]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:07:30.313 --> 01:07:36.336]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[01:07:36.636 --> 01:07:41.478]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:47.943]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:07:48.143 --> 01:07:55.630]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:07:55.890 --> 01:08:03.176]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[01:08:03.436 --> 01:08:06.879]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:08:07.039 --> 01:08:10.001]  That's ChildEase exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:20.022]  What's his name?
[01:08:21.382 --> 01:08:31.529]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[01:08:40.997 --> 01:08:43.138]  It's a military mission in North St.
[01:08:43.178 --> 01:08:43.538]  Louis.
[01:08:43.818 --> 01:08:50.881]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[01:08:51.061 --> 01:08:55.563]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[01:08:55.843 --> 01:08:56.704]  Guns will be taken.
[01:08:56.744 --> 01:08:57.944]  No one will be able to be armed.
[01:08:58.245 --> 01:08:59.225]  We will take all weapons.
[01:08:59.425 --> 01:09:01.746]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[01:09:01.806 --> 01:09:06.128]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:09:06.368 --> 01:09:06.648]  Enough.
[01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:07.489]  Enough.
[01:09:08.029 --> 01:09:08.289]  Enough.
[01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:09.310]  Enough.
[01:09:09.450 --> 01:09:13.933]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[01:09:14.033 --> 01:09:18.096]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[01:09:18.376 --> 01:09:25.361]  NSK SLA News 12's Jeff Farrell discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[01:09:25.561 --> 01:09:33.466]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:09:33.606 --> 01:09:36.108]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[01:09:37.171 --> 01:09:38.852]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:09:39.593 --> 01:09:45.597]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the Journal of Pediatrics.
[01:09:45.897 --> 01:09:50.540]  Blackhawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:55.544]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[01:10:03.283 --> 01:10:08.290]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:09.853]  You're in your apartment!
[01:10:09.953 --> 01:10:11.115]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[01:10:11.275 --> 01:10:12.156]  Go back inside right now!
[01:10:12.316 --> 01:10:13.037]  I am inside.
[01:10:13.057 --> 01:10:14.399]  I have two words for you.
[01:10:15.241 --> 01:10:16.082]  Predator groans.
[01:10:17.063 --> 01:10:18.065]  You will never see it coming.
[01:10:22.091 --> 01:10:24.893]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[01:10:24.953 --> 01:10:34.101]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[01:10:34.201 --> 01:10:39.445]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[01:10:39.666 --> 01:10:44.450]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down!
[01:10:44.730 --> 01:10:46.772]  If you want them, come and take them!
[01:10:48.516 --> 01:10:49.857]  We are on the march.
[01:10:50.198 --> 01:10:52.720]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:10:53.061 --> 01:10:57.725]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:11:12.461 --> 01:11:20.283]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[01:11:20.463 --> 01:11:24.644]  This is the heart of 1776.
[01:11:24.724 --> 01:11:29.205]  We are the heart of 1776, not because we want to be, but because we are.
[01:11:30.145 --> 01:11:32.146]  We saw what was happening 20 years ago.
[01:11:32.286 --> 01:11:33.006]  We took action.
[01:11:33.746 --> 01:11:37.767]  I listened to the patriots in and out of government that warned us of what was going on.
[01:11:37.807 --> 01:11:39.588]  We held back the globalist takeover.
[01:11:39.648 --> 01:11:40.548]  We slowed it down.
[01:11:41.513 --> 01:11:43.074]  But now, worldwide, they're moving.
[01:11:43.774 --> 01:11:44.634]  They're moving fast.
[01:11:46.095 --> 01:12:06.443]  The amount of military training, I was thinking about this this morning, that has been done to take on the gun owners, the veterans, the patriots, is conservatively 200 times what it was when I first got on air.
[01:12:07.794 --> 01:12:08.334]  200 times.
[01:12:08.774 --> 01:12:16.957]  It's going on in every city and in major sub-city on a monthly basis now that we know of in the news.
[01:12:17.637 --> 01:12:19.778]  I mean, there's military crawling all over the place.
[01:12:20.958 --> 01:12:24.480]  In Army Times, they said that when they finally get ready to take over the U.S.
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.981]  or secure it, that they would want in Brigade Homeland 487,000 trips.
[01:12:32.290 --> 01:12:34.091]  in their transition back into life.
[01:12:34.511 --> 01:12:39.373]  And those are the troops that are given questionnaires and trained that said they would fire on U.S.
[01:12:39.413 --> 01:12:42.655]  citizens in all of those tests they were given.
[01:12:44.135 --> 01:12:45.156]  A lot of military is listening.
[01:12:45.316 --> 01:12:46.336]  Army, Navy, Marines.
[01:12:46.377 --> 01:12:54.300]  You go, yeah, we were given digital tests because they kept sneaking out the paper copies back in the 80s and 90s, especially the 90s under Clinton.
[01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:56.081]  Would you fire on citizens?
[01:12:56.141 --> 01:12:57.161]  Would you round people up?
[01:12:57.462 --> 01:12:59.222]  I mean, there's always been civil unrest training.
[01:12:59.483 --> 01:13:00.203]  You've got to have that.
[01:13:01.698 --> 01:13:03.899]  But this is how you deal with riot control, people burning down a city.
[01:13:04.079 --> 01:13:12.561]  Not, oh, veterans are the number one enemy, they're terrorists, we need to practice rounding them up and practice clandestine dressing as civilians and snatching grabs.
[01:13:14.342 --> 01:13:23.024]  And that's why Cuban refugees, some famous ones, have been in the news going, no, we saw the footage in Miami where it showed them practicing putting bags over people's heads in their houses at night.
[01:13:23.304 --> 01:13:24.685]  This is what Fidel Castro did.
[01:13:25.025 --> 01:13:25.525]  Yeah!
[01:13:27.637 --> 01:13:31.020]  America is here, this type of behavior is the opposite direction.
[01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:31.240]  It's 180.
[01:13:33.642 --> 01:13:37.425]  This is flaming, 200 proof tyranny.
[01:13:40.407 --> 01:13:43.489]  If whiskey's 200 proof, it's not whiskey, it's moonshine.
[01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:44.490]  It's pure alcohol.
[01:13:45.351 --> 01:13:48.774]  So when I say it's 200 proof, I mean it is bonafide
[01:13:49.755 --> 01:13:53.620]  You know, you think a 15-foot alligator you can catch in Louisiana is as big as they are.
[01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:55.042]  This is like a 20-foot one.
[01:13:55.282 --> 01:13:55.342]  A 25.
[01:13:55.863 --> 01:14:04.914]  I mean, there's never been anything this systematic, this big, this nasty, this evil, growing anywhere.
[01:14:05.899 --> 01:14:21.143]  They've taken our money, our treasure, our strength, our honor, and built a giant, stinking monstrosity, and then used the world as a battle laboratory to train up the troops to take on the American people, backed up by drones and robots, in the near future.
[01:14:22.423 --> 01:14:23.844]  And who's their first enemy to take out?
[01:14:24.824 --> 01:14:26.385]  If you were this takeover, who's your enemy?
[01:14:26.685 --> 01:14:27.705]  The last HUMET.
[01:14:27.805 --> 01:14:28.985]  The last men.
[01:14:29.325 --> 01:14:31.406]  The last patriots who understand what's happening.
[01:14:32.375 --> 01:14:37.456]  So they bad mouth the... I mean, just this week we've seen an avalanche of mainstream news.
[01:14:38.076 --> 01:14:47.058]  Fox News, Daily Caller, New York newspapers with... We can put them on screen for TV viewers.
[01:14:48.478 --> 01:14:54.080]  Army program teaches that Founding Fathers, Constitution, Bill of Rights, and Christians are sexist and racist.
[01:15:00.381 --> 01:15:00.901]  It's crazy.
[01:15:02.813 --> 01:15:14.097]  And then we have countless clips, we just played a bunch of them last hour, of Indiana counties with the head of the SWAT team going, yeah, we need to have this because the increase of attacks by veterans is getting real bad.
[01:15:14.297 --> 01:15:14.557]  What?
[01:15:16.538 --> 01:15:17.078]  He's lying.
[01:15:18.979 --> 01:15:21.300]  But they know it's self-fulfilling.
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:25.021]  When they start the Civil War, what are veterans going to do?
[01:15:26.954 --> 01:15:36.701]  Because see, they're going to drag a lot of veterans in, question them, they'll get scared, and then they'll say, okay, go out and tell us just like they did at Ruby Ridge.
[01:15:38.562 --> 01:15:39.503]  He was a Green Beret.
[01:15:41.864 --> 01:15:43.045]  Gotta get him back on the show.
[01:15:45.967 --> 01:15:49.489]  And they went to him and they said, we want you to go around setting up other groups in the air.
[01:15:49.509 --> 01:15:50.510]  And he said, I'm not doing that.
[01:15:51.851 --> 01:15:52.591]  So they assaulted him.
[01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:56.054]  He said, I just want to live up here on this mountain and be left alone.
[01:16:01.917 --> 01:16:03.378]  It's the same thing over and over again.
[01:16:03.398 --> 01:16:19.288]  I mean, I remember, they haven't tried it in like 15 years, but, you know, they'd have some guys try to beat me up, and then set me up, and then get me thrown off the radio, and then they'd approach me and say, you know, you really ought to work with us.
[01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:23.731]  Then they have the Democratic Party call me and go, listen, you want to meet Bill Clinton?
[01:16:23.771 --> 01:16:25.012]  You want to really be powerful?
[01:16:25.052 --> 01:16:25.573]  Join us.
[01:16:26.033 --> 01:16:27.494]  I mean, you don't know what it's like, folks.
[01:16:27.534 --> 01:16:29.955]  They do this to the police chiefs and sheriffs and mayors.
[01:16:29.975 --> 01:16:30.676]  They roll over.
[01:16:36.912 --> 01:16:39.693]  Stuff I've had police chiefs tell me off-record is just unbelievable.
[01:16:40.574 --> 01:16:42.775]  I just can't believe how pathetic we've gotten.
[01:16:43.235 --> 01:16:45.476]  It's so criminal what's going on.
[01:16:45.496 --> 01:16:50.859]  And I mean, it's not a challenge at all to not sell out.
[01:16:50.879 --> 01:16:53.220]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.201]  How could you sell out to the takedown of the country?
[01:16:57.862 --> 01:16:58.902]  For tyrants!
[01:16:59.803 --> 01:17:02.424]  But so many people just do what they want to get ahead.
[01:17:02.984 --> 01:17:04.165]  You notice it's killing the country.
[01:17:05.692 --> 01:17:06.633]  So much dishonor.
[01:17:07.754 --> 01:17:13.499]  But more than dishonor, the average man and woman in the military, in the police, in the bureaucracy is compartmentalized.
[01:17:13.859 --> 01:17:14.840]  They just want to pay the bills.
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:16.622]  They just want to go and watch a basketball game.
[01:17:16.982 --> 01:17:17.903]  They just want to go to the movies.
[01:17:17.983 --> 01:17:19.665]  And hey, they want to go drink a six-pack.
[01:17:19.705 --> 01:17:20.786]  And bro, I get it.
[01:17:21.706 --> 01:17:22.127]  I get it.
[01:17:24.669 --> 01:17:27.011]  But you're going to lose everything if you don't stand up now.
[01:17:28.442 --> 01:17:29.943]  There's a way to stop this takeover.
[01:17:29.983 --> 01:17:40.248]  We've been holding it back, slowing it down, but it's kind of like we're, you know, the bus is pushing us towards the cliff and we're holding it back and the tires are spinning, but it's still pushing us and now we're like a foot from the cliff.
[01:17:41.228 --> 01:17:44.470]  And then we're going to be six inches, then we're going to be an inch and it's all going to go over.
[01:17:47.182 --> 01:17:51.706]  And the complainers are up in the front of the bus going, Alex, I thought the bus was going to go off.
[01:17:52.326 --> 01:17:53.107]  Where's the tyranny?
[01:17:53.167 --> 01:17:55.669]  As it gets closer and closer, you can see all the signs around us.
[01:17:56.490 --> 01:17:57.931]  It's all hell starting to break loose.
[01:17:58.871 --> 01:18:04.496]  And then all these idiots are just sitting on their butts in the bus, laughing at us, trying to stop the bus going over.
[01:18:05.056 --> 01:18:12.162]  Or another allegory is you've got the big castle walls and there's arrows coming over and holes blown on the side and enemies cramming over on their
[01:18:14.172 --> 01:18:22.676]  They've got siege machines and they're ladders and there's people standing around all the middle of the fortress, not picking their swords up, going, where's the threat?
[01:18:22.876 --> 01:18:23.677]  Where's the problem?
[01:18:24.137 --> 01:18:26.698]  And then now you look and the gate is on fire.
[01:18:26.738 --> 01:18:27.559]  It's starting to crumble.
[01:18:27.759 --> 01:18:29.820]  You can just see a huge horde right through the flames.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:31.741]  And I'm like, rally, rally!
[01:18:31.781 --> 01:18:32.461]  Warn everybody!
[01:18:32.621 --> 01:18:33.882]  My God, they're trading everywhere!
[01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:35.263]  They're trading to take the Patriots!
[01:18:35.383 --> 01:18:36.023]  They got lifts!
[01:18:36.203 --> 01:18:37.003]  It's all happening!
[01:18:37.023 --> 01:18:39.265]  And it's like, oh yeah, really, trader?
[01:18:40.447 --> 01:18:54.040]  As the President dissolves the border, as they sign on to world government treaties, and won't even let Congress see it, as the FCC grab the internet, start doing alert takeovers of all the media, I mean, man, they are in attack position right now.
[01:18:55.381 --> 01:18:57.883]  They are, the Death Star is cleared to fire.
[01:18:57.903 --> 01:19:03.428]  I mean, they are aimed, they got their technicians in there, turning it up.
[01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:05.971]  They're powered up, they're aimed right at us.
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:13.485]  And I guess they say ignorance is bliss, but man, I can't even cover 5% of the intel coming in.
[01:19:13.845 --> 01:19:22.073]  I mean, it's just over the... Every video we get is... They say the drill's for one thing, it's to take on patriots.
[01:19:23.094 --> 01:19:25.476]  Let's play the Indiana guy again, then I'll come back and play the city council.
[01:19:25.516 --> 01:19:25.836]  Here it is.
[01:19:26.056 --> 01:19:29.599]  We really didn't have the violence that we see today.
[01:19:29.719 --> 01:19:30.360]  Oh, really?
[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:32.162]  The weaponry is... Violent crimes down 51%, liar.
[01:19:33.908 --> 01:19:34.668]  Nope, same stuff.
[01:19:34.688 --> 01:19:35.289]  Oh, yeah.
[01:19:35.849 --> 01:19:36.609]  Oh, that's enough.
[01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:41.252]  Okay, so, so, because of the military might be terrorists, now you've got to be the military.
[01:19:41.272 --> 01:19:48.075]  Oh, well, then I guess the police might be terrorists then, because they have the knowledge, so they have to be watched, and that's next.
[01:20:00.933 --> 01:20:07.450]  You look at this little soft SWAT guy, he's a bureaucrat, guaranteed a democrat, and he just cannot wait, folks, to take on the veterans.
[01:20:08.675 --> 01:20:10.377]  Look, the veterans are going to take you on in your vehicle.
[01:20:10.397 --> 01:20:11.157]  They're going to find you.
[01:20:11.678 --> 01:20:21.866]  From the producers of the multi-award-winning documentary, A Noble Lie, Oklahoma City 1995, Freemind Films is proud to announce the release of their third film, Shadow Ring.
[01:20:22.487 --> 01:20:35.758]  Narrated by award-winning Hollywood actor Kevin Sorbo, Shadow Ring will review the history of America's hidden oligarchy and their hidden agendas, such as the Council on Foreign Relations, the United Nations, and the Federal Reserve Bank.

[01:20:41.522 --> 01:20:42.703]  You know about RVs.
[01:20:42.903 --> 01:20:44.164]  You've heard about bunkers.
[01:20:44.365 --> 01:20:46.927]  But surviving is not recreation.
[01:20:47.127 --> 01:20:49.649]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[01:21:14.416 --> 01:21:23.798]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:21:24.138 --> 01:21:26.678]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.

[01:21:30.399 --> 01:21:36.420]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:41.081]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[01:21:41.161 --> 01:21:41.921]  I think so.
[01:21:59.366 --> 01:22:03.229]  Like chamomile and lemon balm, and essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:24:27.292 --> 01:24:37.707]  You know, Matt Bellamy, a muse, about six, seven years ago, would wear t-shirts with Infowars.com, with Terror Storm t-shirts, promoting my films.
[01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:39.750]  He's been on the show before.
[01:24:41.013 --> 01:24:42.814]  And a lot of his music is influenced by us.
[01:24:43.314 --> 01:24:50.878]  The official Muse website for years only had a link to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as their news sources.
[01:24:51.718 --> 01:25:02.203]  And then Bellamy's given interviews since then that he was basically approached by the establishment and had his views partially changed so that he could basically continue on with what he does.
[01:25:02.883 --> 01:25:04.104]  And see, that's what they do.
[01:25:04.204 --> 01:25:07.526]  They come to you and say, do you want to keep being successful or do you want us to shut you up?
[01:25:07.546 --> 01:25:09.927]  And I'm not attacking Matt Bellamy.
[01:25:11.092 --> 01:25:12.793]  It's just, I love the music of Muse.
[01:25:12.933 --> 01:25:13.553]  Excellent band.
[01:25:13.573 --> 01:25:20.577]  And if I didn't like their music, I could care less if the guy was, you know, a listener or not.
[01:25:20.997 --> 01:25:29.041]  I appreciate the courage of people like Billy Corrigan, who's been threatened to not make political statements or they'll try to shut him down, and then he just keeps going.
[01:25:29.661 --> 01:25:30.562]  Or a Dave Mustaine.
[01:25:31.902 --> 01:25:37.005]  Or even a Charlie Sheen, despite all his baggage and problems, at least he is a guy that wants to be good.
[01:25:37.725 --> 01:25:38.786]  And has courage.
[01:25:40.014 --> 01:25:42.278]  Now, there's like nine of these clips.
[01:25:42.298 --> 01:25:43.760]  In fact, there's exactly nine of them.
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:46.624]  It'll take 20 minutes to air them all, but it's over-the-top important.
[01:25:46.724 --> 01:25:49.929]  Mr. Meade is the spokesman for Jade Helm.
[01:25:49.949 --> 01:25:53.355]  It's being carried out in 18 towns we know of in Texas.
[01:25:53.875 --> 01:25:55.177]  Big Springs City Council
[01:25:57.190 --> 01:25:59.711]  Basically told the truth on a lot of stuff, but not on others.
[01:25:59.731 --> 01:26:01.072]  You'll hear a lot of contradiction here.
[01:26:01.592 --> 01:26:02.612]  Who's participating?
[01:26:02.652 --> 01:26:03.753]  Why'd you choose Texas?
[01:26:04.573 --> 01:26:06.314]  We need civilian cooperation and help.
[01:26:06.394 --> 01:26:11.336]  People who are willing to allow the use of personnel and land and business for secret meetings to be conducted.
[01:26:11.376 --> 01:26:17.858]  See, this is about creating their little takeover cult, HUMET.
[01:26:17.958 --> 01:26:23.841]  I mean, I told you under Clergy Response and under InfraGard, they've recruited basically, or tried to recruit everybody I know.
[01:26:25.506 --> 01:26:30.268]  I mean, every business owner that's, you know, got a major business that I've talked to, they've approached them.
[01:26:30.929 --> 01:26:33.050]  Doctors, lawyers, most of them have been approached.
[01:26:33.070 --> 01:26:34.450]  This is a huge operation.
[01:26:35.751 --> 01:26:37.932]  And it's to identify who will go along.
[01:26:38.832 --> 01:26:40.633]  The globalists have got a problem, though.
[01:26:40.673 --> 01:26:43.215]  A lot of people they've approached have gone ahead and played along.
[01:26:44.935 --> 01:26:47.277]  And they're smart enough not to give me any information.
[01:26:47.297 --> 01:26:49.798]  Because we're decompartmentalized.
[01:26:50.658 --> 01:26:51.899]  And we are not centralized.
[01:26:51.919 --> 01:26:53.199]  There's not even a cellular structure.
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:54.100]  We love freedom.
[01:26:55.472 --> 01:26:57.975]  We've got the enemy so infiltrated it'll make their head spin.
[01:27:00.759 --> 01:27:02.101]  You guys are in a lot of trouble.
[01:27:02.181 --> 01:27:03.963]  That's all I can tell you.
[01:27:03.983 --> 01:27:05.705]  A lot of governors know what's going on.
[01:27:07.508 --> 01:27:09.831]  When you nuke a city and blame it on us, it's not going to fly.
[01:27:12.573 --> 01:27:13.414]  Pieces of crap.
[01:27:14.134 --> 01:27:15.895]  I can't believe I'm living in the real deal here.
[01:27:15.915 --> 01:27:18.356]  I just, I cannot believe how evil this is.
[01:27:18.397 --> 01:27:26.981]  And that you people, the Melissa Harris Perry's of the world, the Michael Moore's and all, you think you're going to play civil war, black op commando with America?
[01:27:27.402 --> 01:27:30.123]  You're at, you have been successful because you were incremental.
[01:27:30.563 --> 01:27:32.064]  Now you want to push to the next level.
[01:27:32.645 --> 01:27:33.905]  And this is incremental.
[01:27:34.205 --> 01:27:37.027]  Just slowly escalating martial law, frog in the pot.
[01:27:37.227 --> 01:27:40.109]  The problem is it's getting so intense and people know now.
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:44.161]  So at a certain point, incremental's not incremental anymore.
[01:27:44.361 --> 01:27:54.244]  You put a piece of paper on top of a stove, and say it's one of those, you know, hot top heaters, and it'll brown, it'll yellow, it'll brown, and suddenly it'll go pffft in the flame.
[01:27:55.004 --> 01:27:58.285]  You put it on top of a flame, it'll light and burn incrementally.
[01:27:59.726 --> 01:28:09.569]  But you put it on top of a hot plate, it'll heat up a lot slower, and won't burst in the flame as fast, but when it does, pffft, this piece of paper's dark brown.
[01:28:10.603 --> 01:28:11.824]  It's smoking all over.
[01:28:11.884 --> 01:28:16.307]  It's about to go... And I'm just going to keep my head down.
[01:28:16.327 --> 01:28:17.788]  I mean, a bunch of stuff.
[01:28:17.808 --> 01:28:18.528]  People get shot.
[01:28:18.588 --> 01:28:19.409]  Stuff gets blown up.
[01:28:19.529 --> 01:28:22.371]  I had nothing to do with it because that doesn't help the Liberty Movement.
[01:28:24.397 --> 01:28:28.781]  But you better believe every time there's a terrorist attack or a cop gets shot, they blame me with no evidence.
[01:28:29.321 --> 01:28:31.984]  We're going to go to break and come back and play these clips one after the other.
[01:28:32.324 --> 01:28:36.748]  I've been so focused for an hour and thirty minutes of broadcast, I haven't plugged any products or anything.
[01:28:37.769 --> 01:28:39.110]  We're under massive attack.
[01:28:39.150 --> 01:28:40.371]  We need your prayers, number one.
[01:28:40.391 --> 01:28:42.413]  We need you to spread the word about the broadcast, number two.
[01:28:42.453 --> 01:28:46.777]  We need you to support our local MNF affiliates, number three, and their sponsors, or become a sponsor.
[01:28:47.297 --> 01:28:50.040]  And number four, we need you to understand
[01:28:51.546 --> 01:28:59.757]  This is a Paul Revere operation and we need people to give our horse, this is a long ride, a place to be put up at night, blankets, food, stuff like that.
[01:28:59.777 --> 01:29:01.359]  We need to be taken care of.
[01:29:01.439 --> 01:29:03.441]  We don't come and take money from you at gunpoint.
[01:29:03.722 --> 01:29:04.482]  We ask you to be
[01:29:06.732 --> 01:29:13.316]  We've got fellow travelers with us in a libertarian way, not in a socialist way, and understand we're all in this together, and we've got great products at great prices.
[01:29:13.356 --> 01:29:14.017]  Shop with us.

[01:29:47.537 --> 01:29:51.661]  And then we get a free bottle of Fluoride Shield with two bottles of Survival Shield X2.
[01:29:52.962 --> 01:29:55.545]  It's all available at Infowarslife.com.

[01:30:00.829 --> 01:30:01.670]  We're on the march.
[01:30:02.170 --> 01:30:03.732]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.752 --> 01:30:04.633]  It's up to you.
[01:30:04.713 --> 01:30:06.715]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:06.735 --> 01:30:08.176]  It's up to you to energize us.
[01:30:08.196 --> 01:30:08.957]  We need the energy.
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:11.760]  U.S.
[01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:17.401]  recruited entertainment corporations to help in propaganda war against Islamic State and Russia.
[01:30:17.761 --> 01:30:27.324]  A search through the leaked Sony email archive shows a close relationship between CEO Michael Linton and President Obama, as well as officials at the State Department.
[01:30:27.644 --> 01:30:32.125]  In total, there were nearly 100 government email addresses in the archive.
[01:30:32.285 --> 01:30:37.166]  WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Julian Assange said, this archive shows the inner workings
[01:30:37.486 --> 01:30:41.811]  Of an influential multinational corporation, it belongs in the public domain.
[01:30:42.191 --> 01:30:44.413]  WikiLeaks will ensure it stays there.
[01:30:44.674 --> 01:30:58.088]  WikiLeaks also notes, Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Michael Linton is on the board of trustees at the RAND Corporation, an organization specializing in research and development for the United States military and intelligence sector.
[01:30:58.348 --> 01:31:07.364]  With this close tie to the military-industrial complex, it is no surprise that Sony reached out to Rand for advice regarding its North Korean film, The Interview.
[01:31:07.665 --> 01:31:10.610]  See the full article at InfoWars.com.
[01:31:11.738 --> 01:31:12.699]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:12.859 --> 01:31:20.545]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds, I lift weights 5 days a week, I can swim 2-3 miles.
[01:31:20.885 --> 01:31:23.808]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[01:31:24.048 --> 01:31:25.629]  I started an access television show.
[01:31:26.029 --> 01:31:30.813]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[01:31:31.413 --> 01:31:34.256]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[01:31:34.776 --> 01:31:40.498]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut.
[01:31:40.859 --> 01:31:45.701]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[01:31:46.101 --> 01:31:50.983]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[01:31:51.263 --> 01:31:58.351]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Group for InfoWarsLife.com, the results were incredible.
[01:31:58.672 --> 01:32:03.818]  Take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call.

[01:32:11.656 --> 01:32:17.819]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:32:17.899 --> 01:32:20.541]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:32:20.581 --> 01:32:27.344]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:32:27.624 --> 01:32:30.466]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:32:30.626 --> 01:32:33.547]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:32:33.567 --> 01:32:35.548]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:32:35.588 --> 01:32:38.390]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:32:38.490 --> 01:32:44.012]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:32:44.232 --> 01:32:47.713]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:32:47.733 --> 01:32:50.714]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:32:50.814 --> 01:32:57.916]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[01:32:58.136 --> 01:33:01.197]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[01:33:07.759 --> 01:33:08.879]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:33:08.939 --> 01:33:34.204]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:34.304 --> 01:33:35.684]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.150 --> 01:33:38.010]  I'll say it again.
[01:33:38.571 --> 01:33:40.191]  Anybody wants to understand what's happening?
[01:33:40.231 --> 01:33:56.899]  Study how the Nazis basically had 99% of the French military stand down when the Germans ran over the Maginot Line and invaded France and took the country in just two short weeks.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:00.341]  And that was only battling the British Expeditionary Force.
[01:34:02.702 --> 01:34:04.663]  Then forcing them out at Dunkirk, at the sea.
[01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:22.986]  And then if you want to go further, you can see how twice, not once, most of Saddam Hussein's generals were paid off in both Gulf Wars previously to stand down.
[01:34:23.006 --> 01:34:30.570]  And that's because before that, for over a decade, Saddam's military was trained in the U.S.
[01:34:30.630 --> 01:34:32.931]  and were allies from the Iran-Iraq War.
[01:34:34.691 --> 01:34:43.716]  Same program, the Pentagon even wrote after the fact, it wasn't widely published but it was in Defense Quarterly and publications like that, how they use the German tactic.
[01:34:44.936 --> 01:34:48.258]  So I'm not telling you something that's my theory, I know what's going on.
[01:34:50.459 --> 01:35:00.024]  Under Clinton, still under Bush, exploding under Clinton, it went on during Bush, same program but quieter, just metastasized under Obama.
[01:35:01.966 --> 01:35:11.931]  They are out basically probing every community leader they can, every person of influence they can, radio stations, TV stations, journalists, you name it.
[01:35:11.951 --> 01:35:14.193]  They legalized domestic propaganda last year.
[01:35:14.213 --> 01:35:16.254]  They've already been doing it.
[01:35:18.595 --> 01:35:27.800]  And they're now, quote, having the Pentagon, as they reported last year in that press conference, the headline of the article was, Pentagon promises to stop lying because of drudge.
[01:35:29.079 --> 01:35:34.004]  And then it goes on to show the hour-long press conference by the Undersecretary of the Army.
[01:35:34.024 --> 01:35:36.867]  No, it was at the Defense Department.
[01:35:38.909 --> 01:35:46.596]  And they're there with hundreds of military in the room and PSYOPs people, the heads of departments, and they say, we'll now go out and help the local media report accurately.
[01:35:46.616 --> 01:35:48.358]  We're going to be embedded with you.
[01:35:48.878 --> 01:35:51.161]  And the military gets up and goes, does this mean we're going to stop lying?
[01:35:51.201 --> 01:35:52.342]  He's like, well, not exactly.
[01:35:53.373 --> 01:35:57.276]  We're going to be involved everywhere to make sure we tell the truth and get their trust back.
[01:35:57.396 --> 01:36:02.780]  I mean, and you look at the morale of the people in the room, they look like they have just been seeing their child die.
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:11.167]  I love how the flags even have the don't tread on me snakes behind him, but now they're phasing that out in the military and saying it's politically incorrect.
[01:36:12.568 --> 01:36:13.749]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[01:36:17.331 --> 01:36:20.414]  Because they all know the PSYOP is they're now going to triple the lying.
[01:36:22.096 --> 01:36:26.562]  The good news is the military, it's in USA Today, has the lowest morale ever.
[01:36:26.582 --> 01:36:31.228]  I'm not saying it's because they have bad morale, it's good that they're good people!
[01:36:32.281 --> 01:36:34.343]  That's why they say, and when they get out, they're the enemy.
[01:36:34.523 --> 01:36:38.426]  I mean, imagine, they're teaching the army and the military, your number one enemy is veterans.
[01:36:38.446 --> 01:36:40.087]  They're like, that's my brother and my dad and me.
[01:36:41.108 --> 01:36:42.329]  Well, they're going to blow stuff up.
[01:36:42.389 --> 01:36:42.710]  What?
[01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:47.954]  I'm going to go ride my motorcycle, get a job, have some kids and take care of my kids.
[01:36:47.974 --> 01:36:49.535]  What do you mean I'm going to blow up cops?
[01:36:49.855 --> 01:36:50.816]  What are you talking about?
[01:36:50.836 --> 01:36:53.418]  It's like Joe Biggs is on TV earlier with us.
[01:36:53.438 --> 01:36:54.099]  He's going, what?
[01:36:54.159 --> 01:36:56.361]  I'm going to blow... I mean, what is this crud?
[01:37:01.721 --> 01:37:06.787]  He wants to go water surfing, wake surfing on the back of the boat with some girls.
[01:37:08.409 --> 01:37:10.091]  You want to kill people in America?
[01:37:10.111 --> 01:37:12.794]  This is the biggest stinking frame-up I've ever seen.
[01:37:13.951 --> 01:37:18.394]  I predicted you'd start hearing that patriots have committed crimes with Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[01:37:18.814 --> 01:37:25.237]  This week they came out twice and said patriot groups are hacking government servers and then claiming ISIS has done it with no proof.
[01:37:25.557 --> 01:37:33.542]  Kind of like they released the Sony stuff, the Pentagon and the Cyber Security and then blamed it on that idiot Kim Jong-un that can't even tie his shoelaces.
[01:37:35.163 --> 01:37:37.564]  Although they admit he gets his shoelaces tied for him.
[01:37:39.765 --> 01:37:42.387]  So, it's the most helter-skelter program
[01:37:43.496 --> 01:37:44.117]  But here's the deal.
[01:37:44.157 --> 01:37:45.118]  There's a method to it.
[01:37:45.178 --> 01:37:50.843]  They want to anger the military and get the Christians and the Patriots, people that are awake, out.
[01:37:51.464 --> 01:37:57.629]  And then rotate in all their bureaucrats and the new commandos.
[01:37:58.190 --> 01:38:00.532]  And it's not that the new commandos will pretty much all be gay.
[01:38:00.552 --> 01:38:02.314]  I'm not saying they're bad because they're gay.
[01:38:02.334 --> 01:38:04.816]  That's in the news today.
[01:38:04.916 --> 01:38:06.037]  It's that politically
[01:38:09.642 --> 01:38:21.385]  They just are a bunch of America-hating, freedom-hating, property-hating, gun-hating, control freaks who dream of some glorious civil war with the American bitter clingers.
[01:38:22.185 --> 01:38:26.166]  I mean, once you actually attack the bitter clingers, it's all over, dummy!
[01:38:27.026 --> 01:38:30.707]  It's like going up to a full-grown grizzly bear and punching it in the nose.
[01:38:34.248 --> 01:38:35.208]  You're such idiots.
[01:38:36.403 --> 01:38:42.286]  You really have taken our restraint as a sign of weakness, instead of extreme control.
[01:38:43.507 --> 01:38:45.048]  Extreme control.
[01:38:47.089 --> 01:38:55.413]  Because every passing day, the power of the Liberty Movement grows, and more people wake up, and every passing day your tyranny bleeds to death.
[01:38:56.033 --> 01:38:58.315]  We're killing you by tens of millions of cuts.
[01:38:59.295 --> 01:39:04.378]  Writing websites on money, on walls, telling people, calling into radio, running for office.
[01:39:05.765 --> 01:39:16.228]  Voting with our dollars, supporting independent media, citizen journalists everywhere documenting what you're really doing, not what you say until your PR machines ground to a halt.
[01:39:16.789 --> 01:39:20.190]  You want to have a war with the American people?
[01:39:20.710 --> 01:39:24.191]  And you think you're going to win that when you come out in the open?
[01:39:24.671 --> 01:39:27.112]  I don't care how many false flags you pull, it's over!
[01:39:29.875 --> 01:39:30.616]  But they know that.
[01:39:31.356 --> 01:39:45.230]  They want their failed system to bring the country down, and then that will break the country regardless, and then they come in after the long winter, the long depression, and buy everything up for pennies on the dollar.
[01:39:47.592 --> 01:39:49.073]  After we've all wiped each other out.
[01:39:49.714 --> 01:39:50.294]  That's the plan.
[01:39:51.736 --> 01:39:54.959]  You see, you couldn't take America down from outside.
[01:39:56.394 --> 01:40:00.157]  There'd be a rifle behind every blade of grass to quote Admiral Yamamoto.
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:04.902]  A fear we've awakened a sleeping giant.
[01:40:08.725 --> 01:40:09.846]  He had to try to convince them.
[01:40:10.126 --> 01:40:15.271]  No, we don't want to try to land in Oregon with troop ships.
[01:40:15.411 --> 01:40:16.452]  It's not going to go well.
[01:40:18.311 --> 01:40:25.573]  Nowadays, if they landed in troop ships wearing peak uniforms, going, uh-uh, tranny, tranny, tranny, literally everyone would just kneel and go, oh!
[01:40:25.953 --> 01:40:27.274]  And just, here are our children!
[01:40:27.294 --> 01:40:29.274]  If it's politically correct, don't be racist!
[01:40:30.095 --> 01:40:30.695]  Shooting everybody.
[01:40:31.075 --> 01:40:32.855]  I mean, that's what political correctness is.
[01:40:33.176 --> 01:40:36.977]  Drink your fluoride, take your Obamacare, open your borders, pay for everything or you're a racist.
[01:40:38.477 --> 01:40:40.858]  It's just a psychological war.
[01:40:42.591 --> 01:40:50.235]  But once the trance is lifted, and the sleeping giant is starting to wake up, once the trance is lifted, people have a very fast learning curve.
[01:40:52.477 --> 01:40:54.398]  Once they're broken, the mind control.
[01:40:55.178 --> 01:40:56.059]  I want to go to these clips.
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:00.661]  But basically all hell is now breaking loose.
[01:41:00.701 --> 01:41:04.263]  The only way to take over is from within, as Cicero said about Rome.
[01:41:06.965 --> 01:41:08.926]  The outside invader comes with their banner openly.
[01:41:09.764 --> 01:41:11.665]  It's the traitor within that infiltrates.
[01:41:11.985 --> 01:41:15.648]  We've been taken over like Vichy France, like Iraq.
[01:41:16.268 --> 01:41:20.591]  We've been infiltrated with a classic CIA, Rand Corporation takeover program.
[01:41:21.311 --> 01:41:24.133]  And it's a big nut to crack, but man, they're doing it.
[01:41:25.254 --> 01:41:31.918]  Off the spree decor of the military, getting all these wannabes, all these guys, you know, that are like 70-something years old, nothing against that.
[01:41:32.554 --> 01:41:39.460]  But I, you know, who want to be, you know, insurance salesmen that make $300,000 a year and they want to be a cop and then they think it's a taser and it's their gun.
[01:41:40.301 --> 01:41:47.387]  Imagine the Feds approaching and going, we're going to give you an InfraGard card or a Homeland Security card to even pay you and go out and recruit other people.
[01:41:48.448 --> 01:41:53.112]  And here's your gun and you're even licensed to kill when you're given the code on your smartphone.
[01:41:53.713 --> 01:41:59.638]  And man, these guys are walking on air that they're now InfraGard.
[01:42:02.341 --> 01:42:08.410]  I've had him walk up to me and McBrain and others on the street, and Leon McAdoo once, going, you're not allowed to film in America, we're gonna get you soon.
[01:42:08.430 --> 01:42:09.251]  The guy's wearing like a $2,000 suit.
[01:42:11.169 --> 01:42:12.549]  He's like, that's right, I'm part of it.
[01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:14.390]  And we're like, oh, you're part of the InfraGard?
[01:42:14.430 --> 01:42:15.130]  How do you know that?
[01:42:15.370 --> 01:42:19.232]  I mean, you give them an armband, you give them a button, it's all over.
[01:42:19.452 --> 01:42:20.812]  But we need our own buttons.
[01:42:20.852 --> 01:42:21.873]  We need our own symbols.
[01:42:22.433 --> 01:42:24.674]  So people know, hey, we're here to help.
[01:42:24.794 --> 01:42:35.137]  We just want basic, low taxes, sovereignty, freedom, a border, and our five-year-olds not to be taught how to, you know, give oral sex.
[01:42:35.978 --> 01:42:36.518]  Pretty reasonable.
[01:42:39.548 --> 01:42:40.108]  They're like, no!
[01:42:40.748 --> 01:42:42.729]  Because they have a will to conquer.
[01:42:43.129 --> 01:42:44.250]  We just have a will to be free.
[01:42:44.690 --> 01:42:46.970]  They have a will to conquer, just like I can't stop fighting them.
[01:42:48.371 --> 01:42:50.312]  I guarantee you folks, they could torture me and I couldn't stop.
[01:42:50.592 --> 01:42:51.632]  I can't stop!
[01:42:53.393 --> 01:42:56.614]  It burns in my bones to quote some passage from the Bible, I forget where.
[01:42:58.334 --> 01:42:59.955]  Can you find the burning in the bones passage?
[01:43:01.135 --> 01:43:01.775]  It's Old Testament.
[01:43:03.136 --> 01:43:03.756]  Is it Ezekiel?
[01:43:03.776 --> 01:43:05.797]  I mean, I burn!
[01:43:06.892 --> 01:43:09.874]  Because, I mean, just like I'd burn if I caught a burglar in my house!
[01:43:09.914 --> 01:43:11.455]  I mean, we're being gang-raped!
[01:43:12.316 --> 01:43:13.196]  I want to go to these clips.
[01:43:14.517 --> 01:43:16.559]  This is Big Spring City Council.
[01:43:16.899 --> 01:43:24.344]  And remember, this is in a backdrop of video in the last week, and headlines everywhere at these drills to take on the Tea Party and gun owners.
[01:43:24.404 --> 01:43:25.425]  I mean, I can play you the clips.
[01:43:25.685 --> 01:43:27.286]  Veterans, gun owners, Tea Party.
[01:43:28.207 --> 01:43:30.849]  They say, we're going to start killing everybody imminently.
[01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:33.150]  With no evidence.
[01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:40.111]  It'd be like if I called the cops 20 times over the years saying, my neighbor, my neighbor's, you know, gonna kill somebody.
[01:43:40.151 --> 01:43:41.412]  My neighbor's gonna kill the other neighbor.
[01:43:41.772 --> 01:43:45.513]  When the other neighbor gets killed, the first person they're gonna come to suspect is me.
[01:43:47.813 --> 01:43:51.934]  And the globalists, the Democrats especially, the Republicans go along with it, that's why they're scared.
[01:43:53.114 --> 01:43:57.576]  They keep telling them, you know, the Patriots are gonna blow up buildings, the Patriots are gonna kill cops, the Patriots, the Patriots.
[01:43:57.836 --> 01:43:59.316]  I mean, this is such an obvious frame-up.
[01:44:00.353 --> 01:44:05.958]  But now they're going operational with this, which makes me think they're not going to let Obama leave office before they pull this.
[01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:11.162]  Because America is being conquered right now.
[01:44:11.422 --> 01:44:15.606]  The treaties are all being signed, the borders are being dissolved, our military is being put under NATO.
[01:44:16.046 --> 01:44:16.847]  It's all happening.
[01:44:19.209 --> 01:44:21.130]  Because if you run this empire, you run it all.
[01:44:22.751 --> 01:44:24.053]  While the stock market implodes.
[01:44:25.066 --> 01:44:26.266]  All right, let's go to clip number three.
[01:44:26.286 --> 01:44:28.747]  We need civilian cooperation and help.
[01:44:29.387 --> 01:44:34.988]  This is Mr. Meade in Big Spring City Council meeting just three days ago.
[01:44:35.028 --> 01:44:35.308]  Here it is.
[01:44:35.328 --> 01:44:44.731]  Special Operations Command, being the director of the exercise, desires to have a very rural area for us to be able to operate in.
[01:44:45.931 --> 01:44:50.552]  Because the last few years, these guys have, in Afghanistan and Iraq,
[01:44:51.730 --> 01:44:56.636]  They receive aerial resupply by helicopter about once a week.
[01:44:56.676 --> 01:44:57.837]  They live in buildings.
[01:44:57.877 --> 01:45:04.445]  They have connectivity to the internet to be able to talk to their command, but also being able to talk to home.
[01:45:05.442 --> 01:45:10.544]  Um, when they come out here to Martin and Howard County, they're not going to have those luxuries.
[01:45:11.184 --> 01:45:24.629]  In the scenario that we've built, they're going to have to operate outside of those normal, uh, support mechanisms, and rely on the folks, the civilians that are in the area to be able to support them.
[01:45:25.009 --> 01:45:26.730]  As if training with people in West Texas is like Afghanistan.
[01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:29.832]  We have a backside support element that actually will replicate that.
[01:45:29.972 --> 01:45:31.693]  The Afghan war is over too, I thought.
[01:45:31.973 --> 01:45:36.476]  We also ask for, we can't do the exercise without the public's help.
[01:45:37.837 --> 01:45:53.266]  Things that we look for from that perspective is we look for people that are willing to be a role player, to just be someone who goes and gives a little nugget of information for them to build an intelligence picture to understand the scenario better and be able to operate better.
[01:45:53.786 --> 01:46:00.928]  We look for people that are willing to transport our guys because they want the relationship before the Civil War starts.
[01:46:01.508 --> 01:46:06.329]  For example, in the back of a horse trailer, in the middle of the night, so nobody can see them.
[01:46:06.849 --> 01:46:08.169]  These are ways that they... Rewind that.
[01:46:08.249 --> 01:46:09.110]  Rewind it 30 seconds.
[01:46:09.330 --> 01:46:11.310]  I should have talked over that.
[01:46:11.370 --> 01:46:11.550]  Yeah.
[01:46:12.050 --> 01:46:15.251]  We need... This is for Afghanistan, so we need you in a cattle trailer.
[01:46:15.831 --> 01:46:17.151]  We need to have that relationship with you.
[01:46:17.211 --> 01:46:19.392]  This is building the cadres in every city.
[01:46:20.883 --> 01:46:28.905]  Well, I guess they had to take, you know, Johnson away.
[01:46:29.345 --> 01:46:33.466]  He was training with them terrorists, part of the ones that nuked Chicago.
[01:46:33.486 --> 01:46:35.087]  I tell ya, I can't believe it.
[01:46:35.147 --> 01:46:35.787]  We gotta do it.
[01:46:35.827 --> 01:46:36.947]  We're allowed to have our guns.
[01:46:37.407 --> 01:46:38.748]  We got badges.
[01:46:39.208 --> 01:46:40.888]  Nobody else can, but we can.
[01:46:42.569 --> 01:46:43.269]  You trash.
[01:46:44.326 --> 01:46:47.410]  But again, these people aren't trash right now, they mean well.
[01:46:47.710 --> 01:46:50.774]  You mean you need training for Afghanistan in my cattle trailer?
[01:46:50.794 --> 01:46:52.115]  It's secret meat?
[01:46:52.215 --> 01:46:52.896]  Absolutely!
[01:46:53.297 --> 01:46:55.099]  While I was in the military myself!
[01:46:55.579 --> 01:46:57.642]  Here's 5,000 for helping me.
[01:46:58.423 --> 01:47:00.605]  Brown or Gonzales, here you go.
[01:47:04.931 --> 01:47:06.031]  You're a Vichy now.
[01:47:09.032 --> 01:47:10.032]  That was so sick.
[01:47:11.072 --> 01:47:11.972]  Look at this spokesman.
[01:47:12.653 --> 01:47:15.193]  I didn't know they could stack crap that high, I gotta tell you.
[01:47:15.473 --> 01:47:17.734]  That's a lying sack of crud right there.
[01:47:18.054 --> 01:47:19.474]  And he doesn't like his job either.
[01:47:20.834 --> 01:47:21.374]  He knows.
[01:47:22.114 --> 01:47:23.695]  Lying to everybody, you fool.
[01:47:24.275 --> 01:47:24.995]  Let's go ahead.
[01:47:25.055 --> 01:47:28.296]  I mean, you want to see the enemy, folks, that's the enemy right there, not the troops.
[01:47:28.756 --> 01:47:30.576]  But sacks of crap like that guy.
[01:47:32.631 --> 01:47:33.312]  I'll tell you what.
[01:47:34.233 --> 01:47:50.147]  Uh, things that we look for, uh, from that perspective is we look for people that are willing to be a role player, to just be someone who goes and gives a little nugget of information for them to build an intelligence picture to understand the scenario and be able to... Rewind it again.
[01:47:51.649 --> 01:47:51.969]  Thank you.
[01:47:52.450 --> 01:47:52.950]  Ten seconds.
[01:47:54.690 --> 01:48:08.676]  Yeah, we have footage going back under Clinton in Hebron, Maryland, where they came over with guns and told us to turn our cameras off, in Alabama, in Florida, all over, where they trained to take on the militia, and they have the Boy Scouts telling them where the guns are.
[01:48:08.916 --> 01:48:13.218]  And then I have the New York Times admitting that the kids are trained to take on the veterans.
[01:48:13.818 --> 01:48:14.738]  So let me explain something.
[01:48:14.778 --> 01:48:22.862]  They, down to the Girl Scouts, USA Today, look it up, Girl Scouts train to spot terrorists and more.
[01:48:24.056 --> 01:48:29.120]  Your daughter, when you send her off to that, if there's a HUMET involved, and now most of them do.
[01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:37.165]  I mean, imagine, in America, the Boy and Girl Scouts, down to Brownies, they ask the Brownies, what's in the medicine cabinet?
[01:48:38.126 --> 01:48:40.407]  There it is, Scouts trained to fight terrorists and more, first line.
[01:48:41.088 --> 01:48:43.169]  They train to take out veterans, and they do.
[01:48:43.929 --> 01:48:48.272]  Okay, let's go back to him saying, just give us little nuggets for Afghanistan.
[01:48:48.813 --> 01:48:50.054]  No, you're creating HUMET
[01:48:51.164 --> 01:48:56.987]  And the new mission, 400,000 troops, is the public plan, RAND Corporation, Army Times, Brigade Homeland.
[01:48:58.948 --> 01:49:10.934]  The cadre was 4,000, now it's up to about 100,000 or so, and they're now creating their domestic army to then command their basic HUMET National Guard teams that are in plain clothes.
[01:49:12.494 --> 01:49:19.358]  And let me tell you, these people that are in this listening right now, the HUMET, the rest of you guys,
[01:49:21.044 --> 01:49:25.005]  I know most of you aren't bad, but you can't handle the peer pressure that you've been inducted into this now.
[01:49:25.245 --> 01:49:26.265]  You're on a power trip now.
[01:49:26.725 --> 01:49:29.225]  You should just now give us all the intel you've got.
[01:49:29.285 --> 01:49:29.846]  I know you will.
[01:49:30.526 --> 01:49:33.046]  You need to put up YouTube videos anonymously.
[01:49:33.066 --> 01:49:34.206]  You need to release it or go public.
[01:49:35.287 --> 01:49:37.247]  Like the Marine Corps Colonel did and others.
[01:49:38.127 --> 01:49:39.407]  And just expose the whole thing.
[01:49:40.888 --> 01:49:43.908]  So don't get out, if you didn't understand this, you're now decompartmentalized.
[01:49:44.248 --> 01:49:44.948]  Give us everything.
[01:49:45.488 --> 01:49:47.829]  I mean, we know it's going to be, you're trying to take on the vets.
[01:49:47.849 --> 01:49:48.389]  We understand that.
[01:49:49.448 --> 01:49:51.789]  And then they're going to have some operatives that come out and claim it was for Afghanistan.
[01:49:51.809 --> 01:49:53.029]  We'll know who they are immediately.
[01:49:53.049 --> 01:49:55.890]  Because they have that look of dishonor in their eye.
[01:49:56.611 --> 01:49:57.451]  Let's go back to the clip.
[01:49:57.671 --> 01:49:58.451]  The public's help.
[01:49:59.792 --> 01:50:05.954]  Things that we look for from that perspective is we look for people that are willing to be a role player.
[01:50:05.994 --> 01:50:12.877]  To just be someone who goes and gives a little nugget of information for them to build an intelligence picture to understand the scenario.
[01:50:12.897 --> 01:50:13.817]  To fight West Texas?
[01:50:13.837 --> 01:50:15.198]  And be able to operate better.
[01:50:15.778 --> 01:50:22.845]  We look for people that are willing to transport our guys, because they have to move around in a clandestine manner.
[01:50:23.465 --> 01:50:28.349]  For example, in the back of a horse trailer, in the middle of the night, when nobody can see them.
[01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:36.617]  These are ways that they have to operate in foreign countries, when they're not supposed to be in those countries.
[01:50:38.150 --> 01:50:41.736]  You're not supposed to be in America under posse comitatus and common sense like that.
[01:50:41.756 --> 01:50:43.458]  Let's skip this network break.
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:45.421]  Let's go to the next clip.
[01:50:45.622 --> 01:50:46.062]  Number five.
[01:50:46.122 --> 01:50:48.686]  What to expect in the involvement of local PD?
[01:50:51.230 --> 01:50:52.091]  What can you expect?
[01:50:54.009 --> 01:51:03.171]  Now, understand that this slideshow is our standard slideshow that we use to brief the counties and the cities.
[01:51:03.191 --> 01:51:05.472]  That Southern Poverty Law Center font, that was made by them.
[01:51:05.492 --> 01:51:08.573]  Within the cities, you won't see most of this, I would tell you.
[01:51:09.853 --> 01:51:11.894]  For example, increased aircraft in the area.
[01:51:11.914 --> 01:51:12.514]  Pause for a moment.
[01:51:13.394 --> 01:51:25.145]  That's the good part of this, because the enemy's smart, but you've got to understand, it's a bunch of ADL, Southern Primary Law Center types that command all this from above the Pentagon, and they just give the scenarios to them, who then put the battle planning into it.
[01:51:25.445 --> 01:51:28.328]  That's kind of the disconnect here, though, when you're reading and seeing this stuff.
[01:51:29.008 --> 01:51:33.673]  It's just incredibly sickening to have foreign registered groups basically operating inside the U.S.
[01:51:34.093 --> 01:51:34.673]  But this is us.
[01:51:34.713 --> 01:51:37.436]  We're a captured country, and we killed 50-something million babies.
[01:51:37.496 --> 01:51:38.757]  I mean, we kind of deserve it.
[01:51:38.797 --> 01:51:39.518]  Here, let's go back to it.
[01:51:39.778 --> 01:51:41.439]  You'll see that out in the rural area.
[01:51:41.879 --> 01:51:53.062]  We have a resupply, an aerial drop that will occur, and then some paratroopers as well will jump into Martin County in early August.
[01:51:53.882 --> 01:51:56.903]  It won't happen within the city limits.
[01:51:57.443 --> 01:51:58.184]  Noise complaints.
[01:51:58.684 --> 01:52:04.305]  If my guys are noisy here in the city, they're really doing something wrong, is what I would tell you.
[01:52:06.406 --> 01:52:09.347]  That third bullet, conducting suspicious activities.
[01:52:10.908 --> 01:52:22.458]  That's where, here in the city, we're looking at using the city from an aspect of conducting clandestine... She's trying to turn the troops into CIA commandos inside America.
[01:52:22.479 --> 01:52:24.000]  There will be no kinetic activity.
[01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:25.822]  There won't be gunfire going on.
[01:52:25.842 --> 01:52:26.882]  No, it's assassination teams.
[01:52:26.902 --> 01:52:27.623]  Things like that.
[01:52:28.024 --> 01:52:34.029]  Our footprints within the cities are probably five to six people at the most when we do these meetings.
[01:52:34.049 --> 01:52:34.529]  Hit teams, yeah.
[01:52:35.450 --> 01:52:41.913]  But one of the most important things, and I know I've said it previously, is we link in with the law enforcement officers.
[01:52:42.293 --> 01:52:45.974]  They know when and where we're conducting activity.
[01:52:46.074 --> 01:52:46.654]  The linking in.
[01:52:46.674 --> 01:52:47.295]  See, getting the cops in.
[01:52:47.315 --> 01:52:51.136]  That way, we actually invite the police department to be near the activity.
[01:52:51.536 --> 01:52:55.017]  That way, they're able to answer constituent calls on that.
[01:52:55.418 --> 01:52:57.898]  The other thing that we do... They have the cover story where they kill the patriots.
[01:52:57.999 --> 01:53:01.160]  Prior to the activity going on, that way,
[01:53:02.776 --> 01:53:18.325]  The police chief can let the dispatch know that this is occurring so that when they field phone calls from concerned citizens, they're able to cut that off at the pass, so to say.
[01:53:19.146 --> 01:53:29.852]  And the other thing that we do as well is we make sure that it tries to get out at the morning and evening roll call so the officers that are on duty know what's going on and know where it's occurring.
[01:53:30.979 --> 01:53:31.980]  And this just goes on.
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:44.889]  I mean, I've got a whole bunch of other clips, but just look at CNN even reporting documents, Army National Guard, ordered to consider Americans as enemy forces and adversaries, internal briefings, read like a strategy for war.
[01:53:44.909 --> 01:53:53.616]  And that was in Missouri with the situation in Ferguson, which was Soros sponsored as the simulant to then legitimize that.
[01:53:56.007 --> 01:54:03.172]  Video armed National Guard troops patrol residential streets in California with their guns at the ready, blocking traffic.
[01:54:04.073 --> 01:54:05.474]  See, this is all just coming out.
[01:54:05.754 --> 01:54:06.775]  All of this unfolding.
[01:54:08.316 --> 01:54:10.778]  Let's go to weapons and ammunition, civilian attire.
[01:54:12.952 --> 01:54:16.535]  They will be carrying weapons, but it won't be live ammunition.
[01:54:16.595 --> 01:54:18.037]  It'll all be blank ammunition.
[01:54:18.077 --> 01:54:19.698]  They always say that when they have trash.
[01:54:19.719 --> 01:54:28.807]  Just to correct one thing that was in the newspaper on Sunday, that I read, was they'll have blank ammunition, but there will not be any explosions.
[01:54:29.868 --> 01:54:34.133]  We won't be setting off live demolition out here.
[01:54:35.754 --> 01:54:36.554]  That's for 9-11?
[01:54:36.574 --> 01:54:39.776]  The guys will be wearing civilian attire or a mixed uniform.
[01:54:39.816 --> 01:54:44.559]  They may be wearing, um, fatigue bottoms and a t-shirt.
[01:54:44.579 --> 01:54:45.279]  Yeah, that's what they wear.
[01:54:45.919 --> 01:54:48.821]  But, that's not normally anything out of the ordinary.
[01:54:48.841 --> 01:54:50.062]  When they got kids, they'll wear white t-shirts.
[01:54:50.142 --> 01:54:53.403]  In West Texas, from what I've seen, especially during hunting season.
[01:54:53.764 --> 01:54:54.584]  Hunting season!
[01:54:54.744 --> 01:54:57.085]  Um, and they may be driving civilian vehicles.
[01:54:57.105 --> 01:54:58.306]  That's a real infiltrator right there.
[01:54:58.326 --> 01:54:58.846]  That's what you're seeing.
[01:54:58.866 --> 01:54:59.366]  That is an infiltrator.
[01:54:59.386 --> 01:55:03.889]  So really, within the city limits, if you notice my guys, they're probably really doing something wrong.
[01:55:09.968 --> 01:55:10.929]  Man, we're in trouble.
[01:55:11.109 --> 01:55:11.930]  Man, we're conquered.
[01:55:17.196 --> 01:55:19.098]  Now let's go to clear marking of the participants.
[01:55:19.138 --> 01:55:20.980]  First they're not going to be marked, now they're going to be marked.
[01:55:21.442 --> 01:55:23.083]  Let's go to that clip.
[01:55:23.123 --> 01:55:24.844]  For us, that's one of the big things.
[01:55:24.924 --> 01:55:28.686]  We make sure that all of our guys have some type of marking.
[01:55:28.706 --> 01:55:35.990]  That they'll all be wearing an armband with a marking that identifies them as part of the exercise.
[01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:37.491]  I'm not going to play any more of that.
[01:55:37.571 --> 01:55:39.432]  And CJ just pointed something out that I was thinking.
[01:55:39.992 --> 01:55:44.375]  He moves and acts and has that nelliness of a Baptist preacher to set you at ease.
[01:55:44.475 --> 01:55:48.417]  I mean, this guy makes you want to cry, actually, that we fall this far.
[01:55:48.557 --> 01:55:49.298]  God Almighty!
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:54.102]  I can't believe how much trouble we're in, Jesus Christ!
[01:55:55.263 --> 01:55:57.005]  I'm not kidding, I just can't handle this anymore.
[01:55:57.025 --> 01:56:02.770]  This country is so gone, they're planning something really bad, folks, and these people are just such traitors.
[01:56:07.274 --> 01:56:10.677]  Let's go to, uh, how often will you do operations like this?
[01:56:10.697 --> 01:56:11.318]  Let's go to that clip.
[01:56:12.777 --> 01:56:15.800]  How often do you do an operation like this?
[01:56:16.861 --> 01:56:18.523]  Is this done annually?
[01:56:19.143 --> 01:56:19.504]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:19.544 --> 01:56:27.932]  So, the Jade Helm project is a new project that has come along from General Cleveland, from his staff.
[01:56:27.952 --> 01:56:29.814]  Which comes out of the U.N., boys.
[01:56:33.774 --> 01:56:37.077]  This exercise is planned to be conducted yearly.
[01:56:38.678 --> 01:56:51.107]  We conduct an exercise that's similar to this, and I say similar because the scope and the breadth of the exercise is nowhere comparable to what we do here.
[01:56:51.428 --> 01:56:55.130]  They conduct that exercise six times a year in North Carolina.
[01:56:57.692 --> 01:57:04.615]  By the way, twice cops have killed military personnel when they try to rob cars and stuff, not knowing what's happening, during the stuff they do outside Fort Bragg.
[01:57:05.216 --> 01:57:14.680]  Which started 30 years ago, so folks go, that's no big deal, they did it there, now it's all over the country, and in the actual drills, it's to take patriots on, and to create the relationships.
[01:57:15.261 --> 01:57:18.502]  This year they'll do a bunch of stuff for the public saying it's for overseas, we already told you that.
[01:57:18.942 --> 01:57:20.223]  Next year it'll be for everybody.
[01:57:20.863 --> 01:57:22.644]  And then the next year it'll be for real.
[01:57:22.704 --> 01:57:24.265]  I mean, I'm just saying, that's how they work.
[01:57:26.291 --> 01:57:27.012]  Listen to this one.
[01:57:27.873 --> 01:57:30.797]  How do the FBI and DEA work with the military on the operation?
[01:57:30.837 --> 01:57:31.197]  Here's that.
[01:57:43.052 --> 01:57:48.733]  I mean, while you guys ship all the drugs in with the DEA, what a group of crooks!
[01:57:48.753 --> 01:57:49.774]  Let's go back and play it.
[01:58:12.079 --> 01:58:23.749]  Working with us here is in Arizona they will actually do some questioning for us at one of the airports in Arizona.
[01:58:23.869 --> 01:58:25.570]  When you're flying people out to see where they go?
[01:58:27.365 --> 01:58:33.789]  And, uh, do y'all use any personnel from NATO, UN, or DHS?
[01:58:34.249 --> 01:58:37.691]  No sir, not currently for Jade Helm it is U.S.
[01:58:37.871 --> 01:58:38.131]  only.
[01:58:38.892 --> 01:58:44.575]  We, uh, that has been one of the discussions that, um, I'm not sure if it has occurred yet.
[01:58:44.595 --> 01:58:46.336]  Better believe that's a lie, by the way.
[01:58:46.356 --> 01:58:48.197]  Jade Helm 15, it will be U.S.
[01:58:48.257 --> 01:58:49.178]  personnel only.
[01:58:50.410 --> 01:58:52.573]  Look, I guarantee you that council knows what's going on.
[01:58:52.633 --> 01:58:54.115]  Alright, we'll be back.
[01:58:54.435 --> 01:58:55.456]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:56.037 --> 01:58:56.938]  This really hurts me.
[01:58:57.018 --> 01:58:57.979]  I mean, it's...
[01:59:01.229 --> 01:59:01.809]  I want more candy!
[01:59:01.829 --> 01:59:02.669]  I want more video games!
[01:59:02.809 --> 01:59:02.909]  Mine!
[01:59:02.969 --> 01:59:03.109]  Mine!
[01:59:03.169 --> 01:59:03.349]  Mine!
[01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:13.891]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:59:14.231 --> 01:59:16.752]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:59:16.932 --> 01:59:20.272]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:59:20.472 --> 01:59:26.493]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:59:26.814 --> 01:59:29.334]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down.
[01:59:29.534 --> 01:59:31.656]  And then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:59:31.936 --> 01:59:38.120]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:59:38.321 --> 01:59:45.806]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:59:46.066 --> 01:59:53.352]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[01:59:53.612 --> 01:59:57.055]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:57.215 --> 01:59:58.916]  That's ChildEase exclusively.
[01:59:59.136 --> 02:00:03.347]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:17.270 --> 02:00:17.911]  Big Brother.
[02:00:18.572 --> 02:00:19.593]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:20.334 --> 02:00:21.456]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:22.097 --> 02:00:22.898]  You want answers?
[02:00:23.679 --> 02:00:24.600]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:25.241 --> 02:00:28.846]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:29.427 --> 02:00:33.492]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.915 --> 02:00:42.782]  You know, just like Al Sharpton owes between two and a half and five million dollars to the Internal Revenue Service, he doesn't really owe it.
[02:00:42.802 --> 02:00:44.684]  It's all fraud, but we all gotta pay it.
[02:00:45.204 --> 02:00:45.905]  Doesn't have to pay it.
[02:00:45.945 --> 02:00:48.908]  Well now, Melissa Harris Perry that says your kids belong to her?
[02:00:51.021 --> 02:00:59.003]  With her arrogant, slack-jawed look, tax-loving lib, and was Erin Perry really a big-time tax delinquent, social media erupts.
[02:00:59.203 --> 02:01:00.563]  Yeah, what a piece of trash.
[02:01:00.583 --> 02:01:03.284]  I'm so sick of these filthy scum.
[02:01:03.304 --> 02:01:05.044]  I gotta be honest with you.
[02:01:06.285 --> 02:01:06.805]  I'm sick of it.
[02:01:06.825 --> 02:01:07.225]  I can't even.
[02:01:07.245 --> 02:01:08.265]  Just get her off the screen.
[02:01:08.305 --> 02:01:08.585]  I can't.
[02:01:08.665 --> 02:01:09.145]  Please!
[02:01:09.245 --> 02:01:10.486]  God, I can't handle it anymore.
[02:01:11.106 --> 02:01:11.666]  Documents.
[02:01:11.846 --> 02:01:15.867]  National Guard ordered to consider Americans as enemy forces and adversaries.
[02:01:16.267 --> 02:01:17.027]  Oh, where's that from?
[02:01:17.127 --> 02:01:17.747]  CNN!
[02:01:19.208 --> 02:01:20.208]  Thought I was crazy!
[02:01:23.058 --> 02:01:24.719]  I am swimming in documentation.
[02:01:24.839 --> 02:01:27.420]  It's pathetic how much proof we've got of this treason.
[02:01:30.522 --> 02:01:30.822]  U.S.
[02:01:30.882 --> 02:01:31.422]  recruitment.
[02:01:33.804 --> 02:01:37.486]  Entertainment corporations to help in propaganda war against Islamic State and Russia.
[02:01:37.506 --> 02:01:43.849]  So while they run Islamic State, they just use that to get more funding.
[02:01:44.790 --> 02:01:49.012]  Scary Big Spring residents report tanks, helicopters arriving before Jade Helm.
[02:01:52.219 --> 02:01:55.662]  Reporters infiltrate cartel-run border town in search of ISIS camp.
[02:01:55.722 --> 02:01:56.582]  Amazing video.
[02:01:59.064 --> 02:02:02.047]  Secret agreement to make corporations unstoppable moves forward.
[02:02:02.087 --> 02:02:02.968]  An amazing article.
[02:02:03.568 --> 02:02:04.008]  Video.
[02:02:04.068 --> 02:02:07.371]  Armed National Guard troops patrol residential streets in California.
[02:02:07.391 --> 02:02:09.973]  That's got 5,500 plus comments.
[02:02:12.215 --> 02:02:13.576]  Food chain catastrophe.
[02:02:13.636 --> 02:02:15.778]  Emergency shutdown of West Coast fisheries.
[02:02:16.198 --> 02:02:17.479]  Populations have crashed. 91%.
[02:02:20.188 --> 02:02:21.369]  I got two guests coming up.
[02:02:21.469 --> 02:02:23.712]  I canceled one guest because there's just so much to cover.
[02:02:25.834 --> 02:02:30.278]  But I wanted to get Keith Johnson from Courage Sewers on.
[02:02:30.979 --> 02:02:33.141]  Couragesewers.com.
[02:02:34.262 --> 02:02:40.569]  He's a citizen reporter that just keeps putting powerful footage of the military training to attack veterans.
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:52.847]  Patriots a few days ago, more footage that nobody was reporting on, that they didn't vote it out on the final committee because of upwards of close to a thousand people showing up and saying they don't want forced inoculations.
[02:02:54.588 --> 02:02:59.611]  That was on nightly news last night because the day before he shot it.
[02:02:59.651 --> 02:03:01.191]  I mean, we don't have the money for journalists.
[02:03:01.472 --> 02:03:02.892]  We don't have the money to coordinate all that.
[02:03:02.932 --> 02:03:05.654]  He just went and did it and now it's being heard and seen by millions.
[02:03:07.395 --> 02:03:07.975]  That's what you can do.
[02:03:07.995 --> 02:03:08.616]  You're unstoppable.
[02:03:09.738 --> 02:03:12.219]  It doesn't matter if it gets picked up by somebody else, it'll get picked up.
[02:03:13.579 --> 02:03:15.019]  They take us out, it'll still get picked up.
[02:03:15.059 --> 02:03:16.120]  They can't shut this down.
[02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:20.601]  They want you as HUMET for the takeover.
[02:03:20.901 --> 02:03:23.341]  They want us to give the military the idea that this is okay.
[02:03:23.721 --> 02:03:24.021]  We're not.
[02:03:24.041 --> 02:03:25.082]  We're going to reach out to the military.
[02:03:25.382 --> 02:03:26.562]  And I'm going to tell you something again.
[02:03:27.002 --> 02:03:29.203]  I was telling the military about this 18 years ago.
[02:03:29.223 --> 02:03:30.223]  I didn't know the first two years.
[02:03:31.643 --> 02:03:32.583]  Fully, what was going on.
[02:03:33.624 --> 02:03:35.624]  And I was told by military, retired and current.
[02:03:36.304 --> 02:03:37.065]  But I had a show.
[02:03:37.765 --> 02:03:38.685]  It's like a V for Vendetta.
[02:03:40.677 --> 02:03:42.758]  When he says to me, why didn't you fight this before?
[02:03:42.778 --> 02:03:45.040]  And he goes, I was waiting for you, Inspector.
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:46.301]  I was waiting for you.
[02:03:46.901 --> 02:03:53.545]  I'd say to these former generals, you name it, colonels, people like Benton Parton on air, but others off air, famous people.
[02:03:53.565 --> 02:03:58.768]  I mean, I even interviewed Admiral Moore, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and he talked about all this.
[02:03:59.149 --> 02:03:59.969]  I talked to him off air.
[02:04:00.410 --> 02:04:01.450]  He died a couple months later.
[02:04:02.691 --> 02:04:04.132]  Not probably natural causes, heart failure.
[02:04:06.169 --> 02:04:07.470]  And I said, why haven't you been fighting this?
[02:04:07.490 --> 02:04:08.311]  Because we've been fighting it.
[02:04:08.331 --> 02:04:09.752]  We've been waiting for people like you.
[02:04:10.112 --> 02:04:11.053]  We haven't had media.
[02:04:11.954 --> 02:04:15.737]  And so many times, I've had people tell me, I was waiting on people like you.
[02:04:15.757 --> 02:04:17.278]  I'm nobody.
[02:04:18.199 --> 02:04:21.662]  Everything I know was brought to me by the insiders, people.
[02:04:22.322 --> 02:04:24.604]  And now I'm telling you the whole plan!
[02:04:25.405 --> 02:04:26.405]  And risking my life!
[02:04:26.846 --> 02:04:27.847]  But that's nothing.
[02:04:27.887 --> 02:04:29.788]  You gotta do it in the face of this evil.
[02:04:30.869 --> 02:04:32.891]  And it's people like Keith Johnson.
[02:04:34.249 --> 02:04:38.733]  And you, man, woman, old, young, I don't care what color you are!
[02:04:38.753 --> 02:04:41.155]  You can be an albino from North Korea!
[02:04:42.656 --> 02:04:44.298]  You got the spark of God in your heart?
[02:04:44.338 --> 02:04:46.320]  Now get out there and expose these liars!
[02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:54.647]  They will fall like all the other arrogant crud like Lenin and Stalin and Hitler and Mao and all of them!
[02:04:55.568 --> 02:04:56.709]  We're gonna beat them!
[02:04:57.549 --> 02:04:58.690]  They're gonna fall!
[02:04:59.451 --> 02:05:00.312]  And they know it!
[02:05:01.536 --> 02:05:04.477]  And they bit off more than they can chew, and they can feel it!
[02:05:04.817 --> 02:05:05.917]  We're coming for them!
[02:05:06.637 --> 02:05:08.938]  With the light of truth, the info war.
[02:05:09.478 --> 02:05:10.198]  That's what they hate.
[02:05:11.319 --> 02:05:13.859]  Let's talk about the real war on women.
[02:05:14.359 --> 02:05:16.800]  First wave feminism was a noble cause.
[02:05:17.180 --> 02:05:18.321]  But modern feminists?
[02:05:18.681 --> 02:05:18.841]  Ha!
[02:05:19.201 --> 02:05:27.123]  Well, instead of fighting for, say, paid and protected maternity leave, they want to ban words, shirts, and manspreading.
[02:05:27.583 --> 02:05:28.244]  Come on!
[02:05:28.604 --> 02:05:35.789]  That's cultural Marxism, which asserts that culture and language is responsible for oppressing women, and not the state.
[02:05:36.129 --> 02:05:39.472]  The truth is, the state encourages gender wars.
[02:05:39.812 --> 02:05:43.815]  It's a divide-and-conquer tactic designed to keep us fighting amongst ourselves.
[02:05:44.215 --> 02:05:48.799]  In fact, the feminist movement was hijacked by the political class to exploit women.
[02:05:49.099 --> 02:05:53.102]  As the late Aaron Russo revealed, the Rockefellers bankrolled feminism.
[02:05:53.562 --> 02:05:59.990]  Not because they had any interest in women's rights, but because women in the workforce was the ultimate trifecta.
[02:06:00.190 --> 02:06:07.378]  The state collects more tax dollars, children are indoctrinated at an earlier age, and the traditional family structure destroyed.
[02:06:07.738 --> 02:06:10.542]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com

[02:07:11.314 --> 02:07:12.255]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:12.415 --> 02:07:20.101]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds, I lift weights five days a week, I could swim two, three miles.
[02:07:20.441 --> 02:07:23.384]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[02:07:23.604 --> 02:07:25.185]  I started an access television show.
[02:07:25.565 --> 02:07:30.369]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[02:07:30.949 --> 02:07:33.812]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[02:07:34.332 --> 02:07:40.054]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut.
[02:07:40.395 --> 02:07:45.237]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[02:07:45.657 --> 02:07:50.539]  I started taking super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[02:07:50.819 --> 02:07:57.904]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Group for InfoWarsLife.com, the results were incredible.
[02:07:58.225 --> 02:08:03.368]  Take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call.
[02:08:03.548 --> 02:08:06.531]  They can answer all your questions or tell you about any of the specials at 888-253-3139.
[02:08:25.319 --> 02:08:31.663]  You are a programmable guy that goes and watches Olympus is Falling and believes all this and really thinks you're a hero.
[02:08:31.903 --> 02:08:32.504]  G.I.
[02:08:32.564 --> 02:08:34.585]  Joe, Great American Hero!
[02:08:34.845 --> 02:08:35.205]  Joe!
[02:08:35.285 --> 02:08:35.686]  Joe!
[02:08:36.046 --> 02:08:37.287]  You don't work for Joe.
[02:08:37.487 --> 02:08:38.648]  Joe got taken over.
[02:08:39.528 --> 02:08:40.049]  The G.I.
[02:08:40.089 --> 02:08:42.450]  Joe command base is run by Cobra.
[02:08:42.510 --> 02:08:44.311]  Do you understand that?
[02:08:44.692 --> 02:08:49.655]  And I use a child analogy to get through to you because that's your main programming template in North America.
[02:08:49.875 --> 02:08:50.815]  They're on record with that.
[02:08:51.236 --> 02:08:52.697]  That was all Pentagon directed.
[02:08:53.297 --> 02:08:54.857]  You understand you work for Cobra.
[02:08:55.137 --> 02:08:56.438]  You dress like Cobra.
[02:08:56.598 --> 02:08:58.038]  You have the tactics of Cobra.
[02:08:58.258 --> 02:08:59.418]  You are Cobra.
[02:08:59.539 --> 02:09:00.619]  Hail Cobra!
[02:09:01.479 --> 02:09:02.539]  You want to be little boys?
[02:09:02.559 --> 02:09:04.960]  Or do you want to really join the Republic?
[02:09:05.460 --> 02:09:10.381]  They know what's going on at the Bundy Ranch, and they won't even let a police information officer give us any information.
[02:09:10.601 --> 02:09:11.341]  That's a bunch of bull****.
[02:09:11.821 --> 02:09:13.182]  It's all these stupid G.I.
[02:09:13.242 --> 02:09:15.902]  Joe movies and stuff, where the White House is attacked.
[02:09:16.102 --> 02:09:17.823]  The White House is run by Cobra!
[02:09:18.343 --> 02:09:26.172]  When I went through the process of becoming Press Secretary, one of the first things they told me was, you're not even to acknowledge the drone program.
[02:09:26.432 --> 02:09:28.814]  You're not even to discuss that it exists.
[02:09:29.375 --> 02:09:30.556]  It's run by chaos!
[02:09:31.017 --> 02:09:32.178]  It's run by Spectre!
[02:09:32.899 --> 02:09:37.484]  Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, Extortion.
[02:09:38.337 --> 02:09:39.338]  They run little kids.
[02:09:39.378 --> 02:09:40.459]  They run the snuff films.
[02:09:40.620 --> 02:09:41.400]  They run the drugs.
[02:09:41.420 --> 02:09:42.021]  They run it all.
[02:09:42.161 --> 02:09:46.826]  And because you act like a bunch of naive chumps, this whole thing's gonna come down on us!
[02:09:47.186 --> 02:09:52.932]  Very much concerns me, considering that they have all this bulk ammunition that they're shooting targets of children.
[02:09:53.453 --> 02:09:55.535]  Would you like to tell me who it is that is doing that?
[02:09:56.075 --> 02:09:57.937]  It is the Department of Homeland Security, sir.
[02:09:58.638 --> 02:09:58.798]  Oh.
[02:09:59.139 --> 02:09:59.959]  Thank you for calling.
[02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:06.262]  To every police officer in this country, to every FBI agent, to every Secret Service agent, you work for Spectre.
[02:10:06.702 --> 02:10:07.782]  You work for Chaos.
[02:10:08.022 --> 02:10:13.023]  You work for Cobra.
[02:10:13.083 --> 02:10:13.944]  How do they get power?
[02:10:14.124 --> 02:10:18.585]  They stage a terror attack using Spectre, using Cobra.
[02:10:22.881 --> 02:10:23.581]  Go f*** yourself.
[02:10:24.102 --> 02:10:24.702]  Who is COBRA?
[02:10:24.882 --> 02:10:28.403]  Arms dealing, drug dealing, money laundering group, wearing masks.
[02:10:28.683 --> 02:10:32.625]  They wear masks, ladies and gentlemen, because they're the corporate CEOs.
[02:10:33.225 --> 02:10:35.486]  And they're manipulating the governments against each other.
[02:10:36.027 --> 02:10:37.307]  COBRA runs the Muslims.
[02:10:37.547 --> 02:10:39.108]  COBRA runs the CIA.
[02:10:39.388 --> 02:10:40.528]  COBRA runs it all.
[02:10:40.769 --> 02:10:41.789]  COBRA is real.
[02:10:42.249 --> 02:10:43.750]  You can call it whatever you want.
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:46.881]  Cobra is in control of America.
[02:10:47.162 --> 02:10:53.026]  And Cobra says the veterans and the gun owners, they're saying that we're the bad guys.
[02:10:53.187 --> 02:10:58.011]  These people who hold themselves down to be patriots are not.
[02:10:58.531 --> 02:11:00.693]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[02:11:01.033 --> 02:11:02.434]  That's what Cobra would say.
[02:11:02.654 --> 02:11:04.055]  That's what Specter would say.
[02:11:04.396 --> 02:11:05.957]  That's what Goldfinger would say.
[02:11:06.197 --> 02:11:08.199]  Because that's who those people are.
[02:11:08.899 --> 02:11:13.282]  I am Supreme Cobra Commander!
[02:11:13.302 --> 02:11:18.344]  You call your petty bureaucrats officials and authorities?
[02:11:18.825 --> 02:11:23.307]  You will kneel before Cobra or face my wrath!
[02:11:25.009 --> 02:11:28.551]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:11:29.032 --> 02:11:30.933]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:11:31.593 --> 02:11:34.475]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Cobra Leader.
[02:11:34.635 --> 02:11:36.756]  You pathetic little worm!
[02:11:36.937 --> 02:11:39.578]  How dare you call me Mr. Cobra!
[02:11:45.825 --> 02:11:47.506]  Spectre, Cub, recall it what you want.
[02:11:47.546 --> 02:11:59.236]  It's criminal influences infiltrating governments, sowing chaos, which they then respond to, having 360 control of the initiation, and then the response, and then the final outcome.
[02:12:00.296 --> 02:12:01.898]  That's full spectrum dominance.
[02:12:03.527 --> 02:12:14.737]  Walter Williams, the fill-in host of Rush Limbaugh, and of course, best-selling author, is going to be joining us to look at how they're trying to balkanize the country, look at race relations in America and more.
[02:12:15.738 --> 02:12:25.787]  His new book deals with American contempt for liberty, set for release just next month.
[02:12:27.930 --> 02:12:29.431]  We'll be talking to him coming up.
[02:12:29.491 --> 02:12:30.331]  I'm very excited about that.
[02:12:30.351 --> 02:12:32.593]  I've only had Walter Williams on one other time like 10 years ago.
[02:12:32.953 --> 02:12:33.693]  Very hard to get on.
[02:12:33.713 --> 02:12:39.177]  If I cross our fingers, I'm really... I'll be honest, I'd like to hear him host a lot better than Rush Limbaugh.
[02:12:39.937 --> 02:12:41.438]  It's hard to turn off when he's on there.
[02:12:41.838 --> 02:12:43.399]  I'm not in competition with Rush Limbaugh, by the way.
[02:12:43.639 --> 02:12:44.760]  I never wanted this time slot.
[02:12:44.980 --> 02:12:46.721]  This is what the radio network in 1998 would give me.
[02:12:49.827 --> 02:12:50.988]  And I said, no, I want to be on at night.
[02:12:51.188 --> 02:12:52.329]  I've been on at night for years.
[02:12:52.429 --> 02:12:53.169]  I want to be on at night.
[02:12:53.189 --> 02:12:55.771]  And they said, no, you're going to be on 11 a.m.
[02:12:55.791 --> 02:12:56.331]  to 2 p.m.
[02:12:56.631 --> 02:12:59.593]  because no one will go up against Rush, and we have stations right now ready to turn you on.
[02:12:59.973 --> 02:13:00.373]  And you know what?
[02:13:00.393 --> 02:13:00.834]  They were right.
[02:13:01.554 --> 02:13:03.195]  Right away, about 100 stations put us on.
[02:13:05.596 --> 02:13:06.997]  So, Ted Anderson was right.
[02:13:07.497 --> 02:13:08.018]  I was wrong.
[02:13:08.598 --> 02:13:11.540]  But this is not some egomania thing to go up against Rush Limbaugh.
[02:13:12.060 --> 02:13:13.121]  It was a network decision.
[02:13:17.543 --> 02:13:24.187]  I know in the radio industry they say if I would just be nicer to the GOP that, you know, that I'm the heir apparent for Rush Limbaugh when he retires.
[02:13:24.247 --> 02:13:24.767]  Yeah, right.
[02:13:25.468 --> 02:13:26.869]  I don't even think about such things.
[02:13:27.109 --> 02:13:38.535]  I just want to stop the global takeover and our biggest success is getting real talking points of liberty and what's really happening into the Republican Party.
[02:13:38.575 --> 02:13:41.077]  The Democrats talk about this on CNN, MSNBC, they hate it.
[02:13:41.897 --> 02:13:47.940]  You tune in to Glenn Becker Rush Limbaugh now, you will hear them talking about what we initiate and the stories we break.
[02:13:48.380 --> 02:13:49.480]  A lot of the time without credit.
[02:13:49.961 --> 02:13:50.701]  I don't care.
[02:13:51.081 --> 02:13:52.102]  I want to beat the globalists.
[02:13:52.162 --> 02:13:53.182]  I don't care about the credit.
[02:13:54.943 --> 02:13:57.584]  It's very liberating to not be in competition with these people.
[02:13:57.984 --> 02:14:01.506]  I'm all for competition in life, but I'm in competition against the globalists.
[02:14:01.606 --> 02:14:02.486]  I want to defeat them.
[02:14:04.967 --> 02:14:05.728]  That's what it's all about.
[02:14:06.696 --> 02:14:09.478]  I haven't taken the money, because it's the radio show that makes money.
[02:14:09.538 --> 02:14:10.819]  It's the huge, big audience.
[02:14:10.919 --> 02:14:12.360]  Millions and millions every hour.
[02:14:14.382 --> 02:14:17.344]  And bought a private jet for millions a year.
[02:14:18.505 --> 02:14:19.445]  Or a huge mansion.
[02:14:20.266 --> 02:14:21.006]  I built this.
[02:14:21.927 --> 02:14:23.308]  I hired all the reporters and writers.
[02:14:23.488 --> 02:14:24.729]  This is what I'm into.
[02:14:26.070 --> 02:14:27.031]  I want to fight these people.
[02:14:27.871 --> 02:14:31.174]  I would give every ounce of blood in my veins right now to defeat the globalists.
[02:14:32.304 --> 02:14:37.609]  If God appeared and said, alright, say you'll die right now and we'll defeat the New World Order, I would say do it.
[02:14:38.890 --> 02:14:40.332]  Then that's not even really a big deal.
[02:14:40.352 --> 02:14:41.033]  Of course I would.
[02:14:41.053 --> 02:14:43.675]  I would lay down my life for all these innocents.
[02:14:44.496 --> 02:14:46.698]  That's the type of attitude that builds civilization.
[02:14:47.879 --> 02:14:50.081]  But I will not lay down and die just to be a slave.
[02:14:50.101 --> 02:14:53.485]  So here's the thing, you'll end up dying and being enslaved going along with them.
[02:14:53.725 --> 02:14:54.646]  Why not stand up?
[02:14:59.261 --> 02:15:00.722]  Well, what's on your family crest?
[02:15:00.802 --> 02:15:02.243]  Is it, I'd rather die than be a slave?
[02:15:02.263 --> 02:15:04.726]  Because I don't really have a family crest.
[02:15:04.746 --> 02:15:13.513]  I mean, I've got our old English crest, but if I'd met a new family crest, it'd be, live free or die, like New Hampshire, and their slogan.
[02:15:15.054 --> 02:15:19.558]  We have our guest, Keith Johnson and other Paul Revere, CourageSewers.com.
[02:15:19.918 --> 02:15:26.744]  CourageSewers.com represents our shift out of typical American philosophy into a courageous world of mindful, creative living.
[02:15:27.554 --> 02:15:31.119]  We focus on what's important in developing a way of living that works for our family.
[02:15:31.599 --> 02:15:34.003]  We are those crazy people with chickens in the urban neighborhood.
[02:15:34.403 --> 02:15:38.389]  Urban farmers, free thinkers, who choose to analytically evaluate everything we read and hear.
[02:15:40.848 --> 02:15:44.029]  Convinced abundance is not a circumstance, it's an attitude.
[02:15:44.469 --> 02:15:45.669]  CourageSowers.com.
[02:15:46.029 --> 02:15:46.589]  Very exciting.
[02:15:46.629 --> 02:15:53.770]  All I know is this guy continues to churn out citizen journalism in California, catching them at a dirty bomb drill, blaming it on the patriots.
[02:15:54.171 --> 02:15:58.831]  Catching them covering up the fact that we're beating the forced inoculation bill right now.
[02:15:59.352 --> 02:16:01.212]  That's not on the news out in California, folks.
[02:16:01.292 --> 02:16:04.072]  It's only on the internet because they won't cover it.
[02:16:04.552 --> 02:16:06.833]  So we've got what all of you should do.
[02:16:08.243 --> 02:16:09.723]  You don't know how to do a YouTube?
[02:16:09.803 --> 02:16:10.224]  It's easy.
[02:16:10.264 --> 02:16:11.924]  Get your son or daughter or neighbor to show you.
[02:16:12.364 --> 02:16:13.805]  Or partner with them to upload it.
[02:16:14.845 --> 02:16:15.265]  Go out.
[02:16:15.545 --> 02:16:16.445]  Go to city councils.
[02:16:16.485 --> 02:16:17.086]  Go to events.
[02:16:17.146 --> 02:16:18.006]  Go to Jade Helm.
[02:16:18.346 --> 02:16:18.546]  Pick.
[02:16:18.766 --> 02:16:19.386]  Go to the border.
[02:16:19.926 --> 02:16:20.587]  Cover news.
[02:16:20.627 --> 02:16:21.947]  Just all of you have a voice.
[02:16:23.067 --> 02:16:25.408]  And then we'll all be targeting and tracking everything.
[02:16:25.788 --> 02:16:29.089]  So when the globalists pull something big, they'll know we're watching.
[02:16:29.189 --> 02:16:29.769]  Or even better.
[02:16:30.789 --> 02:16:31.270]  Even better.
[02:16:32.670 --> 02:16:33.170]  Even better.
[02:16:33.590 --> 02:16:36.111]  They'll be so afraid of our human everywhere.
[02:16:38.095 --> 02:16:41.919]  Our human intelligence people everywhere, not under any group or name, just there.
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:43.520]  That they can't track.
[02:16:44.521 --> 02:16:45.422]  That they can't stop.
[02:16:45.803 --> 02:16:47.945]  They're trying to get Hume out right now with all these drills.
[02:16:48.485 --> 02:16:50.107]  They're trying to get their forces in place.
[02:16:51.768 --> 02:16:54.251]  The military, about 90% of them are totally awake.
[02:16:56.144 --> 02:16:57.385]  I mean, we're in a war, folks.
[02:16:57.405 --> 02:17:01.148]  We're not just going to sit here and let the New World Order gang rape us ahead of this takeover.
[02:17:01.529 --> 02:17:03.430]  We're already in the trenches.
[02:17:03.691 --> 02:17:06.153]  We've already infiltrated our own country against you.
[02:17:06.913 --> 02:17:08.815]  You built these corrupt takeover systems.
[02:17:08.935 --> 02:17:09.816]  We infiltrated them.
[02:17:10.176 --> 02:17:11.938]  See, Valkyrie works both ways.
[02:17:13.019 --> 02:17:14.860]  And you know it, don't you, scum?
[02:17:15.381 --> 02:17:16.522]  Let's go to Keith Johnson.
[02:17:16.562 --> 02:17:17.402]  Keith, we salute you.
[02:17:17.422 --> 02:17:17.883]  Great job.
[02:17:19.079 --> 02:17:19.999]  Oh, thank you, Alex.
[02:17:20.119 --> 02:17:21.520]  May you live an interesting time.
[02:17:22.020 --> 02:17:22.600]  Well, we do.
[02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:24.940]  I mean, look, you are the example.
[02:17:24.980 --> 02:17:27.381]  You're out there constantly engaging citizen journalists.
[02:17:27.801 --> 02:17:30.002]  Tell us about some of your latest exploits.
[02:17:31.762 --> 02:17:36.843]  Well, actually, what I want to say, and this could actually encourage a lot of people that are on the fence thinking about it.
[02:17:38.144 --> 02:17:43.885]  Monday, I was on the Nightly News with David Knight, and that was my first time ever typing.
[02:17:44.425 --> 02:17:44.645]  Ever.
[02:17:46.186 --> 02:17:47.226]  A week ago today,
[02:17:47.970 --> 02:17:54.252]  We were excited about getting 20 or 30 hits on like a Saving Rainwater article or something like that.
[02:17:54.932 --> 02:17:56.172]  And I went out to Richmond.
[02:17:56.293 --> 02:17:56.813]  I woke up.
[02:17:56.833 --> 02:18:01.194]  I was thinking, I don't really feel like getting up and doing this and driving out there.
[02:18:01.214 --> 02:18:02.114]  It's an hour and a half.
[02:18:02.614 --> 02:18:03.695]  You know, no one else can make it.
[02:18:03.715 --> 02:18:04.635]  I was by myself.
[02:18:05.295 --> 02:18:07.416]  I had a little video camera, but I thought, you know what?
[02:18:08.336 --> 02:18:09.116]  Just in case.
[02:18:10.017 --> 02:18:12.978]  And they wouldn't let you in, but through the fence, you got it on tape.
[02:18:14.118 --> 02:18:17.419]  Yeah, actually, one of the cops there from El Cerrito, that's the
[02:18:18.194 --> 02:18:18.954]  No, no, no.
[02:18:18.974 --> 02:18:20.994]  I did not have press credentials, so therefore, no.
[02:18:48.632 --> 02:18:50.414]  But, you know, I got so close.
[02:18:51.575 --> 02:18:58.363]  I went down there thinking it was going to be in the city, where they have city streets shut down, people laying all over, helping people, you know.
[02:18:58.684 --> 02:19:02.648]  You'd think if there was a drill, number one, you want to pick your evidence, you want to help people.
[02:19:02.728 --> 02:19:04.050]  Yeah, Dirty Bomb was just the cover.
[02:19:05.071 --> 02:19:05.752]  Yes, yes.
[02:19:06.292 --> 02:19:09.476]  It was actually in the National Guard compound there.
[02:19:10.569 --> 02:19:12.630]  And there's a little apartment complex next to it.
[02:19:12.650 --> 02:19:14.890]  It's a retired citizen's little place there.
[02:19:15.491 --> 02:19:18.532]  I walked in there, and the only thing separating it was a wrought iron fence.
[02:19:18.612 --> 02:19:21.993]  So I stood there, and the cop said, you can film whatever you want.
[02:19:22.013 --> 02:19:22.513]  So I did.
[02:19:24.153 --> 02:19:31.256]  And now it's getting millions of views, and now your other videos are getting views, and now you've launched your own media operation, my friend.
[02:19:31.496 --> 02:19:34.057]  You took your first step into a wider world.
[02:19:35.297 --> 02:19:37.858]  Yeah, and I want people to know I was on Nightly News.
[02:19:38.656 --> 02:19:50.303]  Um, yesterday my wife did about 35 minutes on the Power Hour with Jack Blood hosting, and now I'm on your show, and like I said, a week ago, none of this.
[02:19:50.323 --> 02:19:56.006]  We're getting a few hits here and there, and you know, Courage Flowers is kind of shaking that shit.
[02:19:56.706 --> 02:20:00.769]  That's right, and now other people need to do it, and the good thing is, you had an effect.
[02:20:01.773 --> 02:20:02.935]  And you're continuing.
[02:20:02.955 --> 02:20:04.277]  I want to come back and talk about the big news.
[02:20:04.957 --> 02:20:05.618]  Straight ahead.
[02:20:06.139 --> 02:20:09.964]  And that is the Statehouse footage you got that is amazing.
[02:20:11.653 --> 02:20:21.839]  From the producers of the multi-award-winning documentary, A Noble Lie, Oklahoma City 1995, Free Mind Films is proud to announce the release of their third film, Shadow Ring.
[02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:35.788]  Narrated by award-winning Hollywood actor Kevin Sorbo, Shadow Ring will review the history of America's hidden oligarchy and their hidden agendas, such as the Council on Foreign Relations, the United Nations, and the Federal Reserve Bank.

[02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:46.320]  And they're getting worse.
[02:20:46.781 --> 02:20:50.003]  That's why Infidel Body Armor introduces Infidel Fridays.

[02:21:11.363 --> 02:21:12.263]  Hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:21:12.423 --> 02:21:20.105]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I weighed 180 pounds, I lifted weights 5 days a week, I could swim 2-3 miles.
[02:21:20.465 --> 02:21:23.386]  Then I discovered the New World Order, the globalists, their agenda.
[02:21:23.626 --> 02:21:25.187]  I started an access television show.
[02:21:25.587 --> 02:21:30.368]  I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I began drinking.
[02:21:30.968 --> 02:21:33.809]  I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes.
[02:21:34.349 --> 02:21:40.071]  I transformed from looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a Jabba the Hutt.
[02:21:40.412 --> 02:21:45.254]  So I began a journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds.
[02:21:45.674 --> 02:21:50.556]  I started taking Super Mel Vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks.
[02:21:50.836 --> 02:21:57.920]  When I added to the mix the key products developed by Dr. Group for InfoWarsLife.com, the results were incredible.

[02:22:41.753 --> 02:22:46.074]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:46.254 --> 02:22:51.816]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:51.936 --> 02:22:55.337]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:24:09.269 --> 02:24:18.772]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing.
[02:24:19.653 --> 02:24:21.893]  Until they got a hold of me.
[02:24:23.214 --> 02:24:24.174]  I used to...
[02:24:26.184 --> 02:24:28.365]  Couple little old ladies, across the street.
[02:24:31.187 --> 02:24:35.809]  You know, I am nicer than I've ever been, but I'm not backing down, and I'm not nice to globalist or Minions.
[02:24:35.869 --> 02:24:37.310]  And I just call it like it is.
[02:24:37.330 --> 02:24:43.853]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing till they got a hold of me.
[02:24:43.873 --> 02:24:49.016]  I opened doors for little old ladies.
[02:24:49.236 --> 02:24:50.777]  I helped the blind to see.
[02:24:56.865 --> 02:24:59.689]  They can't be seen with me.
[02:25:01.490 --> 02:25:06.676]  And I'm feeling mean.
[02:25:06.956 --> 02:25:09.719]  Most people can't sing along to the song and have it actually happen to them.
[02:25:12.683 --> 02:25:17.368]  I'm in hundreds of papers every week lying about me and attacking me because
[02:25:18.422 --> 02:25:20.764]  They can sit there and regurgitate whatever the government tells them to say.
[02:25:20.804 --> 02:25:21.284]  That's fine.
[02:25:21.964 --> 02:25:24.746]  That's why the show gets bigger and bigger, because you're discredited.
[02:25:25.227 --> 02:25:26.187]  No one listens to you.
[02:25:26.287 --> 02:25:26.968]  Very few do.
[02:25:27.929 --> 02:25:31.051]  Going back to Keith Johnson, and then we've got Walter Williams scheduled to be on with us.
[02:25:31.071 --> 02:25:31.811]  I'm really looking forward to that.
[02:25:32.432 --> 02:25:35.614]  Keith, great job, and we really appreciate your citizen journalism.
[02:25:35.654 --> 02:25:36.534]  Keep doing your videos.
[02:25:36.554 --> 02:25:37.255]  Keep sending them to us.
[02:25:37.755 --> 02:25:39.616]  The article's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:25:39.636 --> 02:25:40.657]  I want to finish up with that.
[02:25:41.117 --> 02:25:42.879]  It's got your amazing video of
[02:25:43.956 --> 02:25:56.041]  You said 500, 600, who, I mean, wrapped around the block at the Statehouse, people testifying against forced inoculations, and it hardly made the news locally.
[02:25:56.101 --> 02:25:59.602]  It didn't really make it nationally, but now it is because of your report.
[02:26:00.002 --> 02:26:02.043]  People saying we will not be forcibly inoculated.
[02:26:02.423 --> 02:26:06.284]  By the way, that's a good-looking crowd of parents and folks there to testify against it.
[02:26:06.604 --> 02:26:09.465]  So for now, they're shelving it when there's not opposition.
[02:26:09.486 --> 02:26:10.406]  But you know they'll be back.
[02:26:10.466 --> 02:26:12.507]  But, I mean, just amazing footage.
[02:26:12.527 --> 02:26:13.167]  Tell us about that.
[02:26:14.952 --> 02:26:36.553]  Yeah, well, I was actually at work, and all the stuff with the Richmond drill had just gone off, and I saw they were having the Senate Education Committee hearing down there, and a bunch of parents were going down there to let them know if this passes, I'll be pulling my kids out of school, public school, because it affects private schools, it affects
[02:26:37.543 --> 02:26:40.844]  Homeschooling, some of the curriculum, they got that worded in there.
[02:26:40.884 --> 02:26:42.044]  I haven't flushed that out yet.
[02:26:42.104 --> 02:26:44.265]  And next they'll leave the whole state and then the whole country.
[02:26:44.285 --> 02:26:49.106]  I mean, they need to understand we're going to withdraw our money from their dirty system if they want to brain damage our kids.
[02:26:50.386 --> 02:26:53.367]  Yeah, and there's another law in there too about adults.
[02:26:54.127 --> 02:26:55.707]  There's a mandatory vaccine law.
[02:26:56.087 --> 02:26:56.508]  That's right.
[02:26:56.608 --> 02:26:57.848]  Yeah, tell folks about that.
[02:26:57.908 --> 02:26:58.328]  Exactly.
[02:26:58.368 --> 02:27:00.869]  I mean, this had to be over a thousand people.
[02:27:00.889 --> 02:27:01.549]  I'm looking at the footage.
[02:27:01.589 --> 02:27:02.129]  It's incredible.
[02:27:03.268 --> 02:27:11.392]  Well, I told my wife, I said, why don't you grab the camera, go down there, we'll just do all this over, you know, your turn, you know, hand it on to her, your turn to go down there.
[02:27:12.112 --> 02:27:16.935]  And she sent me a message back and saying, this is incredible, the place is packed.
[02:27:16.975 --> 02:27:18.115]  She goes, I'm going to get in line.
[02:27:18.656 --> 02:27:19.676]  And she had the camera.
[02:27:20.176 --> 02:27:24.799]  And what I did is I found, it's called like Cal Channel or something like that.
[02:27:24.819 --> 02:27:29.601]  And what it is, is they have television cameras in all these buildings and all these rooms.
[02:27:30.686 --> 02:27:34.008]  And you can literally sit there and watch it, or listen to it.
[02:27:34.028 --> 02:27:36.789]  You know, I was at work, so I just put it on, I could just hear the audio.
[02:27:37.710 --> 02:27:41.832]  And all they let him say is name, city, and if you're for or opposed.
[02:27:43.012 --> 02:27:44.833]  And I haven't had time to go through the video.
[02:27:44.853 --> 02:27:50.476]  We tried uploading the video, break that down so we can edit it, and put in, you know, just pieces.
[02:27:51.197 --> 02:27:53.218]  Three hours and 41 minutes long.
[02:27:53.278 --> 02:27:56.179]  Yeah, I just get the highlights, but you were saying the vast majority are against it.
[02:27:56.460 --> 02:27:57.400]  What percentage would you say? 100.
[02:28:00.208 --> 02:28:03.070]  So you're saying there wasn't one person for it?
[02:28:04.111 --> 02:28:04.391]  No.
[02:28:04.731 --> 02:28:06.312]  None that I saw.
[02:28:06.332 --> 02:28:07.213]  That's the headline.
[02:28:08.013 --> 02:28:10.355]  Over a thousand testify, no one for it.
[02:28:10.715 --> 02:28:15.458]  And that's why they're trying to make it mandatory because they know the sleeping giant is awakening.
[02:28:15.478 --> 02:28:16.218]  They're panicking.
[02:28:16.579 --> 02:28:18.320]  I can't wait till we rout these people.
[02:28:19.180 --> 02:28:22.122]  I don't care if I even make it through all this.
[02:28:22.162 --> 02:28:23.423]  I just want to defeat this scum.
[02:28:23.443 --> 02:28:23.743]  Go ahead.
[02:28:23.763 --> 02:28:24.063]  Sorry.
[02:28:24.924 --> 02:28:25.464]  No, no, no.
[02:28:25.504 --> 02:28:27.085]  You got to make that decision going in.
[02:28:27.486 --> 02:28:29.267]  That's just the way it is.
[02:28:30.487 --> 02:28:35.850]  If someone actually wants to sit there and watch that entire video, it's three and a half hours.
[02:28:36.711 --> 02:28:46.797]  But if you go to the last five minutes, even one of the co-authors from San Diego, I believe Michael Block, even he looked nervous because the room was packed.
[02:28:47.157 --> 02:28:55.202]  They just sat there for about two hours and watched person after person after person say, this is my name, this is where I'm from, I'm a teacher, I'm opposed.
[02:28:55.808 --> 02:28:59.730]  Many people are saying, I represent my entire school of 6,000 people.
[02:29:00.351 --> 02:29:01.752]  I represent 100 people.
[02:29:01.772 --> 02:29:04.113]  I represent... And these people were shaken.
[02:29:04.713 --> 02:29:08.736]  They did not like what they heard, and they were supposed to have it.
[02:29:08.756 --> 02:29:14.099]  Now, I know the sin is, in committees, there's always questions.
[02:29:14.179 --> 02:29:15.980]  There's always things to get worked out.
[02:29:16.020 --> 02:29:17.001]  There's always bugs.
[02:29:17.281 --> 02:29:21.003]  You know, we always delay for information for our questions, and that is true.
[02:29:22.256 --> 02:29:33.943]  However, the question is, and even what these Senators were saying, the problem is if they refuse vaccination, what happens to these kids when they're not in school?
[02:29:34.444 --> 02:29:38.626]  Are we going to have thousands of kids that aren't eligible for school?
[02:29:39.827 --> 02:29:41.068]  We have a right to education.
[02:29:42.580 --> 02:29:44.740]  So it was looking a little hairy in there.
[02:29:45.101 --> 02:29:45.721]  Absolutely.
[02:29:45.741 --> 02:29:51.662]  Well, brother, you've done a great job and everybody's going to go through that video and actually get some of those clips together soon.
[02:29:52.202 --> 02:29:52.762]  Keep it up.
[02:29:52.802 --> 02:29:57.523]  Well, I'm sure we'll hear more from you as a great California correspondent to the people of the world.
[02:29:57.883 --> 02:29:58.383]  Take care.
[02:29:58.483 --> 02:29:59.663]  CourageSewers.com.
[02:29:59.703 --> 02:30:00.284]  Keith Johnson.
[02:30:00.664 --> 02:30:01.684]  Walter Williams coming up.
[02:30:02.064 --> 02:30:03.644]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:04.564 --> 02:30:07.245]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:11.710 --> 02:30:15.033]  The vaccination lies and hysteria continue to ramp up in California.
[02:30:15.333 --> 02:30:18.975]  The Temecula Valley School District recently sent a letter home to parents stating the following.
[02:30:19.296 --> 02:30:24.980]  To help protect your children and others from whooping cough, a new California law now requires students to be vaccinated against whooping cough.
[02:30:25.220 --> 02:30:29.804]  This applies to all students entering the seventh grade and any student transferring from out of state.
[02:30:30.564 --> 02:30:35.129]  But they fail to mention the exemption that exists by law that covers medical or personal beliefs.
[02:30:35.510 --> 02:30:47.483]  In fact, you can find it in the California Health and Safety Code 120325, and the particulars of the exemption can be found in California Health and Safety Code 120360, which is specifically about the exemptions.
[02:30:48.104 --> 02:30:56.748]  It's letters like these that continue to push Big Pharma's agenda to inject you and your young children with toxins, heavy metals, live viruses, and DNA from insects.
[02:30:57.009 --> 02:30:58.890]  Don't be intimidated by vaccine pushers.
[02:30:59.150 --> 02:31:01.771]  Do your own research and read the damn insert.
[02:31:02.191 --> 02:31:05.253]  This is Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:31:05.713 --> 02:31:09.415]  For more reports like these, subscribe to the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[02:31:11.172 --> 02:31:12.072]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:31:12.132 --> 02:31:12.533]  Good, brother.
[02:31:12.693 --> 02:31:14.353]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:31:14.413 --> 02:31:16.174]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:31:16.354 --> 02:31:20.356]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:31:20.376 --> 02:31:22.957]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:31:22.997 --> 02:31:25.238]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:31:25.258 --> 02:31:33.302]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:31:33.602 --> 02:31:36.707]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[02:31:36.847 --> 02:31:38.349]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:41.274]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:31:41.414 --> 02:31:42.796]  Saving a ton of money there.
[02:31:43.076 --> 02:31:45.560]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[02:31:45.800 --> 02:31:48.885]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated.
[02:31:49.125 --> 02:31:50.746]  Or maximum potency.
[02:31:50.907 --> 02:32:01.075]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience where stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[02:32:01.135 --> 02:32:02.876]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[02:32:40.848 --> 02:32:41.448]  Alex Jones here.
[02:32:41.869 --> 02:32:50.914]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.

[02:33:22.629 --> 02:33:26.575]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:33:27.136 --> 02:33:28.498]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:35.503 --> 02:33:40.827]  Well, I tell you, the gentleman we have joining us doesn't need any prompting on talk radio.
[02:33:41.307 --> 02:33:45.430]  He is the longest continual fill-in host for Rush Limbaugh, 20 years.
[02:33:46.050 --> 02:33:57.538]  I was in college listening to Walter Williams, 20 plus years, and I've read some of his books, I've seen clips of his documentary shown on PBS, Suffer No Fools.
[02:33:58.618 --> 02:34:00.039]  He's just an amazing individual.
[02:34:00.059 --> 02:34:01.600]  He has a new book coming out next month.
[02:34:02.061 --> 02:34:05.263]  Everybody should pre-order at Amazon.com, American Contempt for Liberty.
[02:34:06.263 --> 02:34:07.103]  Comes out May 1st.
[02:34:07.504 --> 02:34:08.844]  A strike, I guess, at the Socialist.
[02:34:09.264 --> 02:34:17.646]  I'm not going to go through all of his lawyer degrees and PhDs in economics and all the rest of it, I mean, because it would take too long to go over all his degrees.
[02:34:18.086 --> 02:34:22.668]  But I gotta say, and I said it earlier, I like it when he hosts the Rush Limbaugh Show better than Rush.
[02:34:23.648 --> 02:34:24.588]  It's more hardcore.
[02:34:25.108 --> 02:34:28.929]  But I'm going to quit kissing his butt and just get right to the actual meat and potatoes.
[02:34:29.610 --> 02:34:33.231]  We have Martin Luther King coming out to paraphrase in the 60s, and I agree with it.
[02:34:33.531 --> 02:34:34.531]  We should judge someone on the
[02:34:35.091 --> 02:34:36.253]  character of their deeds.
[02:34:36.293 --> 02:34:37.334]  In fact, here's the quote.
[02:34:37.654 --> 02:34:44.542]  I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by color of their skin, but by the content of their character.
[02:34:45.183 --> 02:34:52.792]  How did we get from there, something that's so Veritas, Dr. Williams, to the inverse where everything is about the color or the sex
[02:34:53.613 --> 02:34:56.074]  And with these hate laws, other people are more protected.
[02:34:56.615 --> 02:35:05.120]  And the Democratic Party has just gone race crazy and admits they're trying to divide and conquer to the point of just absurd.
[02:35:05.180 --> 02:35:06.500]  I mean, you're the expert on this.
[02:35:07.401 --> 02:35:08.101]  Are they winning?
[02:35:08.221 --> 02:35:08.962]  Are they losing?
[02:35:09.022 --> 02:35:10.963]  Where is this insanity going, Doctor?
[02:35:11.913 --> 02:35:14.513]  Well, I'm not sure whether they're winning.
[02:35:14.894 --> 02:35:16.374]  They're fairly strong.
[02:35:16.414 --> 02:35:24.555]  But I think that what has happened is that after the Civil Rights Movement, people found that they can hustle.
[02:35:24.595 --> 02:35:26.555]  They can become poverty pimps.
[02:35:26.595 --> 02:35:30.176]  They can make a lot of money.
[02:35:30.296 --> 02:35:32.356]  Al Sharpton, he gets a lot of money.
[02:35:32.717 --> 02:35:33.757]  Or Jesse Jackson.
[02:35:34.357 --> 02:35:41.258]  And I think, I don't know how wise it is of us to ask Al Sharpton to go out and get a real job.
[02:35:42.338 --> 02:35:43.619]  And make much less money.
[02:35:43.639 --> 02:35:54.906]  He just makes money on, you know, hustling and exploiting whatever problems that might exist among blacks and whites.
[02:35:55.466 --> 02:36:03.131]  But I think one of the things that goes unnoticed and is not said enough, and that is black Americans as a group,
[02:36:04.534 --> 02:36:05.075]  I don't think so.
[02:36:21.485 --> 02:36:24.367]  We would be the 17th or richest nation on the face of this earth.
[02:36:25.508 --> 02:36:28.711]  There are few black Americans who are among the world's richest people.
[02:36:29.351 --> 02:36:34.275]  There was one black American who was the head of the world's mightiest military, Colin Powell.
[02:36:36.537 --> 02:36:41.621]  And some black Americans are some of the world's most famous personalities.
[02:36:42.001 --> 02:36:47.165]  Now, the significance of this is that in 1865, neither a slave nor a slave owner
[02:36:50.140 --> 02:36:50.620]  We're good to go.
[02:37:08.235 --> 02:37:10.677]  In the world, except United States of America.
[02:37:10.697 --> 02:37:20.365]  Now, just because these gains have been made, it doesn't mean that they're not major problems, but the problems are not civil rights problems.
[02:37:20.445 --> 02:37:28.912]  That is, many people look at the problems in many black communities as civil rights problems, and the civil rights struggle is over and is won.
[02:37:29.432 --> 02:37:33.895]  That is, at one time, black Americans did not have the constitutional guarantees of everybody else.
[02:37:34.355 --> 02:37:35.076]  Now we do.
[02:37:35.536 --> 02:37:41.820]  But the fact that civil rights problems are over does not mean that they're not problems, but they're not civil rights problems.
[02:37:42.100 --> 02:37:48.764]  And the point is, is that if we view them as civil rights problems, the solutions will be elusive forever.
[02:37:49.926 --> 02:37:50.626]  Well, that's right.
[02:37:50.666 --> 02:37:57.811]  And it seems like the Democratic poverty pimps, the Democratic Party, they don't want their old paradigm to end.
[02:37:57.831 --> 02:38:04.175]  And so now they're just hyping up any slight they can to create division, to create hate.
[02:38:05.075 --> 02:38:08.317]  They're promoting all this, what I call reverse racism.
[02:38:08.357 --> 02:38:09.438]  It just goes on and on.
[02:38:09.458 --> 02:38:11.760]  And it's cartoonish when you see it.
[02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:14.702]  But it's not just with black folks it's happening.
[02:38:14.722 --> 02:38:26.874]  The political entitlement of how they're trying to make women think that men somehow have, you know, tried to screw them over or that anybody with any money is bad and that capitalism is bad.
[02:38:26.994 --> 02:38:32.980]  It just seems like there's a death wish for the country coming out of the whole Soros funded combine.
[02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:37.004]  What do you think's behind this as an economist and a lawyer, Mr. Williams?
[02:38:37.523 --> 02:38:45.889]  Well, I always say follow the money, and so there's a lot of money and a lot of jobs to be had for people who are involved in this hustle.
[02:38:46.449 --> 02:38:53.874]  And I think that when you look, you were mentioning, you used the term cartoonish, and it is indeed cartoonish.
[02:38:53.914 --> 02:39:03.901]  That is, when you find these marches around the country as a result of the shooting in Ferguson, Missouri.
[02:39:04.634 --> 02:39:08.601]  Or the shooting in New York, a black man shot by police.
[02:39:09.602 --> 02:39:14.771]  And if you say, well look, if policemen became angels tomorrow...
[02:39:15.780 --> 02:39:18.723]  It will not have done very much for the murder of blacks.
[02:39:18.763 --> 02:39:23.207]  That is, there's an average of 7,000 blacks murdered each year.
[02:39:23.227 --> 02:39:30.094]  And in places like Chicago, it's sometimes, some years, it's been one black murdered per day.
[02:39:30.614 --> 02:39:33.958]  And it's not the Klan coming and doing that.
[02:39:34.338 --> 02:39:37.201]  And then there's other cartoonish type things that is
[02:39:38.195 --> 02:39:42.677]  People are blaming discrimination for many problems that blacks face.
[02:39:43.598 --> 02:39:50.962]  However, if you look at the illegitimacy rate among blacks, that is 75% of black babies are born out of wedlock.
[02:39:51.562 --> 02:39:56.465]  Now, I'm not a prude, but it's not the best start on life.
[02:39:56.845 --> 02:40:02.588]  If you're born, you find your mother is 16, your grandmother is 30, and you'll know who or where your father is.
[02:40:02.648 --> 02:40:03.268]  That's not a very good
[02:40:03.889 --> 02:40:07.494]  As you know, your four to five towns who are likely to be in prison are on drugs.
[02:40:07.535 --> 02:40:11.781]  The Democratic Party promotes that, I believe, to create a system of dependency.
[02:40:12.442 --> 02:40:14.746]  And, I mean, is it not the modern plantation?
[02:40:15.086 --> 02:40:17.951]  These places like Chicago and other areas are more like a reservation?
[02:40:18.818 --> 02:40:19.278]  That's right.
[02:40:19.298 --> 02:40:19.979]  You're absolutely right.
[02:40:20.179 --> 02:40:27.883]  But see, the thing that people don't have very little appreciation for is that all of this is new among black people.
[02:40:27.943 --> 02:40:34.847]  That is, in 1940, the illegitimacy rate among blacks was 13 or 14 percent.
[02:40:35.208 --> 02:40:36.809]  Wasn't it lower than even whites?
[02:40:37.769 --> 02:40:44.433]  Well, in the 19-teens, the illegitimacy rate among black teenagers was less than that among white teenagers.
[02:40:44.493 --> 02:40:46.094]  So now it's been totally inverted.
[02:40:46.721 --> 02:40:47.322]  Oh, that's right.
[02:40:49.064 --> 02:40:55.251]  I have in my book a race and economics, and I give these statistics, and in 1870s, 1880s,
[02:40:59.111 --> 02:41:03.255]  75% of black kids lived in two-parent families, and in some cities higher.
[02:41:03.515 --> 02:41:07.618]  I'm talking about cities like Detroit, Chicago, Philadelphia, New York.
[02:41:07.819 --> 02:41:15.805]  As a matter of fact, in New York, in Harlem, New York, Harlem's New York's Harlem, 85% of black kids lived in two-parent families in 1925.
[02:41:15.885 --> 02:41:16.266]  Now, today,
[02:41:19.328 --> 02:41:22.311]  It's around 30% of black kids live in two-parent families.
[02:41:22.552 --> 02:41:35.164]  So the point that I'm making is that much of the pathology that we're seeing among black Americans is entirely new, and moreover, I believe that it's the result of the welfare state.
[02:41:35.871 --> 02:41:42.313]  Well, I mean, it's got to be undoubtedly, and you go through all the statistics as an economist in your books, the Democrats have to know this then.
[02:41:42.453 --> 02:41:44.114]  What is the endgame strategy?
[02:41:44.914 --> 02:41:46.615]  Where do you think they're wanting to take people?
[02:41:46.655 --> 02:41:58.720]  Because the same paradigm that we've seen with them, quote, helping blacks with the Great Society, has now been deployed to every other community, and we see the same slide towards illegitimacy, drugs, crime, the thug culture.
[02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:00.960]  I mean, where did this come from?
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:01.581]  I mean, I know MTV...
[02:42:03.072 --> 02:42:06.895]  Well, you know, you mentioned the spread of this culture.
[02:42:08.196 --> 02:42:19.566]  When Patrick Moynihan was writing about the decline of the black family in the 1960s, the illegitimacy rate among black Americans at that time was close to 30%.
[02:42:19.626 --> 02:42:23.249]  The illegitimacy among whites today
[02:42:24.069 --> 02:42:26.791]  Is where it was for blacks in 18 and 1965.
[02:42:27.052 --> 02:42:31.395]  That is the illegitimacy rate among whites is over 30% today.
[02:42:31.415 --> 02:42:32.776]  It's all going the same direction.
[02:42:33.617 --> 02:42:37.179]  Yeah, we're all going to say and it's and it's the welfare state.
[02:42:37.300 --> 02:42:47.968]  I mean that is look if you know, I don't I don't care whether an economist is a conservative or liberal, but he'll tell you that if you tax something you're going to get less of it.
[02:42:48.619 --> 02:42:51.581]  And if you subsidize something, you're going to get more of it.
[02:42:51.901 --> 02:42:55.504]  And what we've been doing is subsidizing sloppily behavior.
[02:42:55.804 --> 02:42:58.166]  That is, there's no cost.
[02:42:58.506 --> 02:43:02.289]  There's very little cost for people to engage in sloppily behavior.
[02:43:03.274 --> 02:43:06.075]  Does a girl have a baby out of wedlock?
[02:43:06.275 --> 02:43:08.436]  No, she doesn't pay, really, the cost.
[02:43:08.836 --> 02:43:09.917]  It's the taxpayer.
[02:43:10.197 --> 02:43:14.919]  That is, the government will give them a subsized housing, food stamp, welfare, etc., etc.
[02:43:15.899 --> 02:43:21.901]  And so it makes it very cheap to behave in self-destructive ways.
[02:43:23.502 --> 02:43:26.363]  What do you think is behind this clear social engineering?
[02:43:28.124 --> 02:43:30.445]  Well, I think that it gets people's votes.
[02:43:31.306 --> 02:43:37.912]  I mean, any politician talking the way that I am would get run out of town.
[02:43:37.972 --> 02:43:40.375]  He would not get voted.
[02:43:42.296 --> 02:43:51.065]  Forget the material things I'm saying about race, but just any politician who would promise, who would act,
[02:43:51.505 --> 02:43:57.091]  To uphold and defend the United States Constitution, he would get run out of town by the American people.
[02:43:57.432 --> 02:44:06.642]  Because increasingly, and it's sad to say, increasingly Americans are having more and more contempt for the United States Constitution.
[02:44:07.423 --> 02:44:07.723]  Wow!
[02:44:08.183 --> 02:44:09.925]  Walter E. Williams is our guest.
[02:44:11.135 --> 02:44:14.038]  What do you think the legacy of Obama is going to be?
[02:44:14.058 --> 02:44:30.698]  I mean, I really was concerned about the centralization of power under Clinton and Bush, and now, Dr. Williams, we see the borders totally wide open, paying with vouchers to bring the illegal children in, above the law, power plants getting shut off outside of law,
[02:44:31.478 --> 02:44:34.480]  Our military being put under UN-NATO command outside of law.
[02:44:35.441 --> 02:44:38.023]  Obama ignoring FOIA requests.
[02:44:38.063 --> 02:44:41.466]  The IRS not getting in trouble for stuff that makes Nixon look like an angel.
[02:44:41.926 --> 02:44:44.448]  I mean, is this not real totalitarianism?
[02:44:45.168 --> 02:44:48.190]  How would you as a political scientist quantify
[02:44:49.278 --> 02:44:57.722]  What we've now become, because I expect the Republicans, when they get in power, to not be as vitriolic against America as much, but still they lack power.
[02:44:58.282 --> 02:45:01.243]  I mean, I fear the direction, the trajectory of this country.
[02:45:02.444 --> 02:45:04.285]  What do you think Obama's legacy is going to be?
[02:45:05.020 --> 02:45:16.707]  Well, I predicted in 2008 in one of my columns, and I was predicting that Obama administration would be a failed administration, a failed president, just like Jimmy Carter is.
[02:45:16.787 --> 02:45:22.490]  But some people are saying that Obama is beginning to make Jimmy Carter look good.
[02:45:23.851 --> 02:45:30.295]  But the point is that Obama is following a trend in our country.
[02:45:31.122 --> 02:45:33.183]  And he's just accelerated that trend.
[02:45:33.243 --> 02:45:40.165]  That is, you found during the Bush administration, you found all kinds of ignoring the Constitution.
[02:45:40.445 --> 02:45:43.186]  You found, you know, the No Child Left Behind.
[02:45:43.587 --> 02:45:50.169]  You found the prescription drugs and all these other programs that happened during the Bush administration.
[02:45:50.609 --> 02:45:52.630]  So we've been on this path.
[02:45:53.602 --> 02:45:57.825]  Away from the Constitution, away from personal liberty for quite a while.
[02:45:59.245 --> 02:46:05.629]  And so the real challenge is, the real question for the future of our country is, can we reverse it?
[02:46:06.029 --> 02:46:08.751]  And there's some question whether it's reversible.
[02:46:10.230 --> 02:46:11.210]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:46:11.230 --> 02:46:13.691]  I want to get into your new book, American Contempt for Liberty.
[02:46:14.271 --> 02:46:22.853]  If we don't, studying history as you've done, if we don't reverse the course we're on, how long do you think this country has left?
[02:46:22.934 --> 02:46:24.454]  Because it's degenerating fast.
[02:46:25.094 --> 02:46:26.595]  Well, I don't know.
[02:46:26.655 --> 02:46:30.436]  But, you know, people have asked me, you know, what can we do?
[02:46:30.536 --> 02:46:37.377]  And I asked them, well, are Americans anyway basically different as human beings from the Romans?
[02:46:38.278 --> 02:46:38.958]  From the French?
[02:46:39.764 --> 02:46:42.387]  From the Spanish, from the Portuguese, from the British.
[02:46:42.728 --> 02:46:48.314]  Now these are great empires of the past, powerful empires of the past, but they went down the tubes.
[02:46:48.795 --> 02:46:59.068]  And so, and they went down the tubes for precisely the kind of things that we're doing, that is bread and circuses, big government spending programs.
[02:47:00.126 --> 02:47:05.288]  So, there's a real question whether Americans will find a different fate.
[02:47:05.648 --> 02:47:07.829]  You find a country just like Argentina.
[02:47:07.969 --> 02:47:15.051]  Argentina is a basket case, but in 1940, or the 1930s, it was among the 10 richest countries in the world.
[02:47:15.111 --> 02:47:16.271]  It was, absolutely.
[02:47:16.331 --> 02:47:19.733]  And then they got into big government, they got into deficits, and now it's a hellhole.
[02:47:20.453 --> 02:47:21.013]  That's right.
[02:47:21.213 --> 02:47:21.753]  That's right.
[02:47:21.793 --> 02:47:23.394]  They got into socialism.
[02:47:23.494 --> 02:47:26.475]  A lot of the decline, it was accelerated during the Perons.
[02:47:28.270 --> 02:47:33.930]  And socialism is, when socialism takes over, a country does not have much hope.
[02:47:34.810 --> 02:47:38.692]  The saying was, as rich as in Argentina, and now people don't even know what that means.
[02:47:38.732 --> 02:47:41.254]  It is so sad to see them wreck this.
[02:47:41.274 --> 02:47:51.079]  And I saw statistics today that even the middle class is shrinking fast, and that even the ultra-wealthy are paying so many taxes that they're having trouble saving.
[02:47:51.479 --> 02:47:58.143]  And then France now has a 100% tax, Forbes reported, on their wealthier people, forcing them to leave the country.
[02:47:58.583 --> 02:48:01.424]  What are the socialist things going to happen when they're all gone, Dr. Williams?
[02:48:01.785 --> 02:48:04.126]  Well, you know, the rather remarkable thing
[02:48:04.884 --> 02:48:13.748]  For throughout our entire history, we've been the place where people have run to, to avoid high taxes, to avoid oppression.
[02:48:14.208 --> 02:48:16.369]  Now, people are leaving the United States.
[02:48:16.549 --> 02:48:29.134]  That is, wealthy money is leaving the United States, going to the islands, banking in other countries, and going to Liechtenstein and other places to put their money.
[02:48:30.623 --> 02:48:39.138]  So we're going in the direction, I don't know at what speed, but we're going in the direction of other countries that have adopted socialistic policies.
[02:48:39.369 --> 02:48:41.890]  Walter E. Williams, I know you support law and order.
[02:48:41.950 --> 02:48:43.491]  I support the rule of law as well.
[02:48:43.931 --> 02:48:47.233]  But the over-militarization accelerated under Obama now.
[02:48:47.794 --> 02:48:53.016]  All these training manuals where they say the big enemy of the Pentagon is the Tea Party, veterans, gun owners.
[02:48:53.056 --> 02:48:53.957]  I'm sure you're aware of that.
[02:48:53.997 --> 02:49:00.841]  If not, I can play you some news clips where they say, we need the MRAP tanks for the veterans, when the veterans aren't out there doing anything.
[02:49:01.261 --> 02:49:06.944]  What do you think of this attempt by the Democrats to basically turn the military into a domestic tool?
[02:49:07.799 --> 02:49:13.002]  Yeah, well, that's what socialism needs.
[02:49:13.322 --> 02:49:20.586]  In order for government to be able to impose its will, it needs force, because a lot of people will not go along with it voluntarily.
[02:49:20.886 --> 02:49:27.510]  And then also, if you notice, the very people in our country who are the most
[02:49:28.270 --> 02:49:37.235]  Anti, you know, anti-gun, or anti-Second Amendment, they are the very people who are trying to take over our lives.
[02:49:37.415 --> 02:49:42.738]  They're the ones armed into the teeth, they're the ones with bodyguards like Michael Moore, but you and I, we can't have a gun.
[02:49:43.795 --> 02:49:44.836]  That's absolutely right.
[02:49:45.036 --> 02:49:55.842]  And the point is, what a lot of Americans do not know is that the founders of our nation, they did not give us the Second Amendment in order for us to go deer and duck hunting.
[02:49:56.242 --> 02:50:12.371]  They explicitly said, and it's in my column this week, they explicitly said that we want the American people to be armed as a last resort against the betrayal of their freedom by their representatives and rulers.
[02:50:13.496 --> 02:50:16.857]  Wow, we got one final segment after this quick break with Walter E. Williams.
[02:50:16.897 --> 02:50:18.138]  Walterewilliams.com.
[02:50:18.458 --> 02:50:19.698]  His books are all bestsellers.
[02:50:20.258 --> 02:50:23.739]  They're complex, they're historical, but they're also an easy read.
[02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:26.000]  I'd give them to your high school kids, you name it.
[02:50:26.841 --> 02:50:28.341]  It's just so important.
[02:50:28.801 --> 02:50:37.464]  I just gave Rush's book to my daughter, who's 10, The Brave Pilgrims, to get a more accurate perspective on what's going on.
[02:50:37.744 --> 02:50:39.585]  There's an attack on any type of Americana.
[02:50:40.885 --> 02:50:45.989]  Certainly America's got a lot of bad in our past, but our ideals were the greatest, and we made the greatest strides.
[02:50:46.029 --> 02:50:47.430]  That's why the system's attacking it.
[02:50:47.830 --> 02:50:51.872]  What they're replacing it with, as Dr. Williams said, is a bunch of rum and bread and circuses.
[02:50:52.333 --> 02:50:53.954]  I'm going to have a wild card here.
[02:50:54.014 --> 02:50:58.036]  I'm going to have him come back in the last six minutes and kind of cover whatever he wants to cover.
[02:50:58.076 --> 02:50:59.517]  I've been asking the questions so far.

[02:51:11.132 --> 02:51:14.293]  Finally, a hard rock album that actually says something.
[02:51:14.513 --> 02:51:16.574]  Envy, the self-titled senior.
[02:51:17.294 --> 02:51:20.415]  We all live in a world today where things aren't what they seem.
[02:51:20.615 --> 02:51:29.218]  And if you think the news is real, you're living in a dream.
[02:51:29.358 --> 02:51:34.260]  I can't stand this no more.

[02:53:41.658 --> 02:53:42.399]  Hey, Boomer!
[02:53:42.659 --> 02:53:45.981]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:53:46.101 --> 02:53:47.682]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[02:53:47.762 --> 02:53:49.523]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:53:49.724 --> 02:53:55.207]  Mom says it's because the Berkey Filtration System cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:53:55.567 --> 02:53:56.308]  I know, right?
[02:53:56.388 --> 02:53:57.328]  You love it, too!
[02:53:57.709 --> 02:53:59.030]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[02:53:59.150 --> 02:54:00.050]  Let's go get some!

[02:54:28.177 --> 02:54:30.779]  Well, he's Professor Dr. Walter E. Williams.
[02:54:30.879 --> 02:54:32.220]  Walterewilliams.com.
[02:54:32.980 --> 02:54:35.903]  And he's on with us broadcasting worldwide.
[02:54:36.223 --> 02:54:44.749]  In the six minutes we've got left, sir, there's so many subjects we can cover, but I'd like to give you the floor to host the show here for a moment and get into what you think is the heart of the matter.
[02:54:45.666 --> 02:54:51.548]  Well, one of the things I think that I always tell people is, people say, well, what do you try to do, Walter?
[02:54:51.568 --> 02:55:01.812]  Well, I say, I'm trying to sell our fellow Americans on the moral superiority of individual freedom and personal liberty and its main ingredient, limited government.
[02:55:02.472 --> 02:55:06.533]  And it's rather surprising what has happened to our country.
[02:55:06.913 --> 02:55:08.834]  And just let me give you an idea.
[02:55:08.874 --> 02:55:14.236]  When I say that there's a lot of contempt for the United States Constitution and contempt for the ideas of liberty,
[02:55:15.962 --> 02:55:21.789]  In 1794, Congress appropriated $15,000 to help some French refugees.
[02:55:22.830 --> 02:55:26.935]  James Madison, the acknowledged father of the Constitution, and a former president,
[02:55:30.962 --> 02:55:47.345]  He stood on the floor of the House I rate, and he said, and I'm virtually quoting him, he says, I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article in the Constitution that authorizes Congress to spend the money of their constituents for the purposes of benevolence.
[02:55:48.462 --> 02:55:54.923]  Now, if you look at the federal budget today, two-thirds to three-quarters of it is for the purpose of benevolence.
[02:55:55.463 --> 02:56:00.364]  And you ask the question, and also Madison said, charity is not a function of government.
[02:56:00.844 --> 02:56:15.047]  Now, anybody, any person running for the presidency today who would make the same statement that James Madison, as well as other founders made, the American people would run them out of town on the rail.
[02:56:15.663 --> 02:56:26.830]  That is, the American people have contempt for the great ideas and the great ideas of liberty that made us the richest and the freest country in the world.
[02:56:27.862 --> 02:56:42.047]  And to give you another example, if I'm running for the Senate in Texas, and I go back and forth across the state, and I say, look, my fellow Texans, I've read the United States Constitution.
[02:56:42.627 --> 02:56:44.348]  I know what the Constitution authorizes.
[02:56:44.408 --> 02:56:48.529]  I know what Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution says.
[02:56:50.086 --> 02:56:59.949]  If you elect me to the Senate, don't expect for me to bring back aid to higher education, highway construction, prescription drugs, and all these other programs.
[02:57:01.089 --> 02:57:05.211]  The question is, do you think the people of Texas would elect me to the United States Senate?
[02:57:06.991 --> 02:57:11.933]  Texas might, but probably only two or three other states, but it'd be a fight.
[02:57:12.013 --> 02:57:19.555]  I think Texas understands that we would just keep all of our money here and decide what we would want to do instead of giving the feds all the control.
[02:57:20.287 --> 02:57:22.189]  Most states should be voted out, though.
[02:57:22.910 --> 02:57:33.741]  Well, see, I think that if I as senator don't bring back money to Texans, it doesn't mean that Texans will pay a lower federal income tax.
[02:57:34.322 --> 02:57:37.605]  All that it means is that the money will go to Oklahoma instead.
[02:57:38.066 --> 02:57:42.991]  That is, once legalized theft begins, it pays for everybody to participate.
[02:57:43.297 --> 02:57:43.858]  No, you're right.
[02:57:43.898 --> 02:57:46.562]  We can't get out of it because our money will just go somewhere else.
[02:57:47.524 --> 02:57:48.585]  That is absolutely right.
[02:57:48.645 --> 02:57:54.495]  And so, that's the tragedy in our country, that it pays for people...
[02:57:55.313 --> 02:57:57.195]  To engage in legalized theft.
[02:57:57.255 --> 02:58:07.883]  That is, it pays for people to use the power of their office, it pays for people to elect people who will use the power of their office to take what belongs to one American and bring it back to them.
[02:58:07.983 --> 02:58:11.706]  They have wired fraud into the system and now they're just expanding it.
[02:58:11.987 --> 02:58:14.589]  What about Obama saying he may raise taxes by executive power?
[02:58:15.339 --> 02:58:19.522]  Well, he has no constitutional authority to do that.
[02:58:19.862 --> 02:58:28.109]  And then, you know, a lot of people say, well, look, the Bush tax cuts, the Bush tax increases, the Obama increases, Obama tax increases.
[02:58:29.430 --> 02:58:33.933]  According to the Constitution, the president has no taxing and spending authority.
[02:58:33.953 --> 02:58:34.213]  That's right.
[02:58:34.554 --> 02:58:39.798]  Only the Article 1 gives Congress the taxing and spending authority.
[02:58:40.018 --> 02:58:43.040]  That is, the president cannot spend one dime on Congress.
[02:58:44.335 --> 02:58:45.557]  Walter Williams, amazing.

[02:58:46.919 --> 02:58:47.880]  Hope you'll come back soon.
[02:58:47.920 --> 02:58:48.841]  Have a great weekend, sir.
[02:58:49.262 --> 02:58:49.582]  Thank you.
[02:59:02.376 --> 02:59:03.437]  In the near future.
[02:59:03.737 --> 02:59:07.899]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:59:08.219 --> 02:59:09.260]  Security alert.
[02:59:09.460 --> 02:59:11.201]  This is Homeland Security.

[02:59:15.163 --> 02:59:17.944]  But the worst people get controlled and tell us that we
[02:59:17.964 --> 02:59:20.005]  We are the ones responsible.
[02:59:20.045 --> 02:59:20.986]  Prime Directive.
[02:59:21.086 --> 02:59:22.446]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:59:22.606 --> 02:59:25.408]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:59:25.468 --> 02:59:28.510]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:59:28.710 --> 02:59:30.931]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:59:31.011 --> 02:59:32.532]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:59:32.552 --> 02:59:34.913]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:59:35.373 --> 02:59:37.054]  They're never going to stop.
[02:59:37.314 --> 02:59:41.276]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
