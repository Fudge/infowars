[00:00:19.673 --> 00:00:21.675]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:25.478]  It is Friday, December 18, 2015, and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:26.619]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:36.368]  Tonight, the House approves a $1 trillion spending bill.
[00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.932]  Then, Bernie Sanders and the drama of the DNC.
[00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:46.865]  And Obama continues to state there is no credible threat to the U.S.
[00:00:47.626 --> 00:00:48.287]  That's next.
[00:00:48.807 --> 00:00:54.072]  You realize what degenerate, cultural, oxymorons these people are?
[00:00:54.212 --> 00:00:55.433]  These are power grabbers.
[00:00:55.714 --> 00:01:00.058]  These are people who just want to lecture us all day and tell us how to live and guilt us.
[00:01:00.098 --> 00:01:06.324]  Well, I'm not guilty, you fascist, evil, slug Obama.
[00:01:09.517 --> 00:01:16.240]  Your family out of Kenya, funding and literally running jihad operations all over the Middle East and Africa?
[00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:18.541]  I'll give Obama this, he's bold.
[00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:22.904]  I could never have imagined an Islamic radical sleeper cell becoming president.
[00:01:23.144 --> 00:01:25.185]  I mean, I can't believe the CIA did this.
[00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:31.580]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.161]  You can't survive without it.
[00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:34.261]  But where do you get it?
[00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:40.325]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:46.268]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:01:46.468 --> 00:02:03.329]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.850]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.390]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.450]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.331]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:11.451]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:02:33.298 --> 00:02:45.807]  Well earlier this week we told you about a billion, no trillion dollar spending bill and tax break bill that was set to pass through the house with flying colors and lo and behold that has happened today.
[00:02:46.187 --> 00:02:48.109]  The house approved a 1.1 trillion dollar
[00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.792]  Spending bill that had a majority Democrat vote.
[00:02:52.832 --> 00:02:57.636]  And this is despite the fact that the Republicans are the majority in both the House and the Senate.
[00:02:58.097 --> 00:03:02.240]  Now, their conservatives said this omnibus bill frustrated them.
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:10.786]  They said the bill failed to address many of the Obama's controversial initiatives and ceded a lot of power to Democratic demands.
[00:03:11.307 --> 00:03:11.447]  But
[00:03:11.547 --> 00:03:14.408]  But nevertheless, they went ahead and signed it anyway.
[00:03:14.508 --> 00:03:18.130]  So this is just further evidence of the fact that this is a total failure.
[00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.913]  On behalf of the American people, we made our intentions clear with giving them the majority in both the House and the Senate.
[00:03:26.074 --> 00:03:34.677]  And once again, just like they ceded control to the Democrats for the entire fiscal year of 2015, that's going to now continue on into probably 2017.
[00:03:36.238 --> 00:03:37.019]  So there you go.
[00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.381]  They're kind of sleeping on the job.
[00:03:38.521 --> 00:03:41.725]  And oh yeah, by the way, they passed this right before their Christmas break.
[00:03:42.226 --> 00:03:45.409]  So they're your public servants, your elected representatives.
[00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.016]  And of course, just like Obama came out yesterday sort of gloating about the fact that these two bills were
[00:03:52.478 --> 00:03:54.040]  Putting the ball in their court, so to speak.
[00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.784]  Harry Reid comes out gloating as well.
[00:03:57.545 --> 00:04:02.411]  He said it's been a very successful year for the Democrats and he's gloating there on the House floor.
[00:04:02.431 --> 00:04:07.477]  He said months ago, Democrats called on Republicans to work with us to craft a budget agreement.
[00:04:08.018 --> 00:04:09.679]  We wanted to get rid of sequestration.
[00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.280]  We were able to do that.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.141]  All three goals we had, we accomplished.
[00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:24.787]  So he's just basically sitting out there saying how amazing they are and saying how this legislation caps off a successful year for Senate Democrats.
[00:04:25.587 --> 00:04:36.150]  So, it clearly has not been a successful year for Republicans, other than the fact that they got the majority of the votes of the American people that they promptly threw away.
[00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.030]  So, this is just further proof of the whole left-right paradigm.
[00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.071]  All it is, is to paralyze voters.
[00:04:42.451 --> 00:04:49.093]  Meanwhile, behind closed doors, they're working together to go ahead and cede their power to the one master.
[00:04:49.633 --> 00:04:53.694]  Now, something else that happened, the Fed finally raised interest rates.
[00:04:54.534 --> 00:04:59.959]  This is actually America's first interest rate hike in nearly a decade and of course this was expected to happen.
[00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:04.082]  They raised key interest rates from a range of 0% to 0.25% to the range of 0.25% to 0.5%.
[00:05:10.487 --> 00:05:18.837]  So it's a very small rate hike, but it's going to affect millions of Americans, especially those who are investors or homebuyers and savers.
[00:05:19.137 --> 00:05:25.084]  You know, of course, you're going to see a teeny tiny little bit of increase their interest in your deposit to the bank.
[00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:33.733]  But they say that this move is a good indicator of how the economy has turned around and healed since the Great Recession.
[00:05:34.154 --> 00:05:36.836]  And Obama was actually quite confident of this fact as well.
[00:05:36.916 --> 00:05:43.103]  He mentioned this as one of his achievements today in his final speech of the year.
[00:05:43.503 --> 00:05:47.928]  Now, we had economist Peter Schiff on the show and, you know, he was singing a different tune.
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:06:00.055]  The Fed was talking about the fact that it was going to raise rates later in the year, that they thought the economy would be strong enough so that it would be appropriate to raise rates before year end.
[00:06:00.476 --> 00:06:04.302]  And of course, the analysts were expecting the rate hikes to come a lot sooner.
[00:06:04.682 --> 00:06:08.106]  They were people thought they would have done it at least two or three times by now.
[00:06:08.486 --> 00:06:11.950]  But the Fed kept passing and kept talking about how they were data dependent.
[00:06:12.451 --> 00:06:13.973]  All of a sudden they got to December.
[00:06:13.993 --> 00:06:15.294]  There's two weeks left of the year.
[00:06:15.314 --> 00:06:17.016]  Rates are still at zero.
[00:06:17.516 --> 00:06:22.502]  And I think they thought that if they didn't raise them now, they would lose their credibility.
[00:06:22.622 --> 00:06:23.944]  It would prove that the economy
[00:06:24.304 --> 00:06:26.286]  Was too weak to withstand a rate hike.
[00:06:26.666 --> 00:06:40.019]  So I think to try to create a false sense of confidence and to try to save some of their credibility, they raised interest rates by a token amount in a symbolic gesture to try to save face and create confidence.
[00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:40.980]  And you know what?
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.102]  It's backfiring on them, as I thought.
[00:06:43.122 --> 00:06:45.224]  You know, the market is down substantially.
[00:06:45.264 --> 00:06:48.387]  We're down, Dow's down, what, about 250 points as we speak.
[00:06:48.407 --> 00:06:49.048]  It was down almost 300.
[00:06:49.768 --> 00:06:54.613]  It dropped 250 points yesterday, but the real carnage is going on beneath the scenes.
[00:06:55.213 --> 00:06:57.756]  Look at what's happening in the high-yield bond market.
[00:06:58.036 --> 00:07:00.158]  Look what's happening in some of these leveraged funds.
[00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:03.321]  We're seeing all sorts of things blowing up.
[00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:10.488]  It looks very much like the way the markets were looking in the months leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.
[00:07:12.332 --> 00:07:22.900]  Well, today we learned that an audit showed that Bernie Sanders' campaign was repeatedly accessing sensitive voter information that belonged to Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:29.606]  Now, it was this breach of sensitive voter information that led Sanders to fire his National Data Director.
[00:07:30.186 --> 00:07:36.447]  And now the DNC is clearly taking a very heavy-handed response to that.
[00:07:37.247 --> 00:07:44.349]  They are basically blocking Bernie Sanders' entire campaign from being able to access their own information.
[00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:51.650]  So they can't even get in there and access the information that they've collected on their voters with their large grassroots effort.
[00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.271]  And now Bernie Sanders is threatening to sue the DNC.
[00:07:56.091 --> 00:08:01.075]  And his top aide Jeff Weaver said they are not going to sabotage our campaign.
[00:08:01.876 --> 00:08:13.844]  They've suspended their access to the National Voter Database and this is actually right before voting is set to take place in Iowa and New Hampshire so this could be a huge blow to Bernie Sanders' campaign.
[00:08:14.645 --> 00:08:31.853]  Now even though the campaign admitted its staffers had inappropriately reviewed and saved Clinton's campaign data, it was made available via a software error, but they're emphatically accusing the DNC of sabotage and of blatantly favoring
[00:08:32.213 --> 00:08:33.073]  Hillary Clinton.
[00:08:33.113 --> 00:08:34.094]  And of course they are.
[00:08:34.154 --> 00:08:35.915]  They are all in for Clinton.
[00:08:36.355 --> 00:08:44.638]  So hopefully what's going on with this election season will help to expose the con game that is the election process.
[00:08:44.678 --> 00:08:48.840]  Now obviously on the Republican side we had Ben Carson and Donald Trump calling out
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.060]  I think so.
[00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:10.827]  Not allowing them to access these.
[00:09:10.887 --> 00:09:12.768]  And they've never done anything like this before.
[00:09:13.468 --> 00:09:18.431]  This is a very heavy-handed move that they make that could potentially sabotage Bernie Sanders' campaign.
[00:09:18.451 --> 00:09:22.273]  And of course, in Iowa and New Hampshire, he's very close to Hillary Clinton there.
[00:09:22.893 --> 00:09:28.796]  But also, you can look and see how the DNC has swung the debate schedule itself.
[00:09:29.297 --> 00:09:33.479]  That right there is a blatant expose of how they are all in for Clinton.
[00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:42.482]  And Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders have both been coming out recently in weeks saying, why are you holding debates on the weekends?
[00:09:42.862 --> 00:09:44.443]  So they've had two debates.
[00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:47.464]  This one coming up will be the second debate on a Saturday.
[00:09:48.044 --> 00:09:49.745]  There's another one being held on a Sunday.
[00:09:49.765 --> 00:09:53.566]  Of course, there's going to be some big time football games going on at the same time.
[00:09:53.586 --> 00:09:54.907]  So no one's going to be watching.
[00:09:55.227 --> 00:10:01.769]  And of course, that's going to swing the votes in favor of Hillary because she could win potentially on her last name alone.
[00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.010]  So they don't want to have
[00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.452]  O'Malley or Bernie Sanders getting any airtime.
[00:10:06.632 --> 00:10:16.217]  So, of course, you know, this is quite sneaky little tactics that are being exposed in this election season, which is pretty comforting to know, actually.
[00:10:16.557 --> 00:10:23.260]  Now, Obama has come out yesterday reassuring Americans there is no credible threat of terror.
[00:10:23.721 --> 00:10:26.762]  Even so, he wants us all to remain vigilant.
[00:10:26.902 --> 00:10:29.864]  He says he's got his teams working overtime 24 hours a day.
[00:10:32.305 --> 00:10:38.008]  Now, this is at the same time, of course, he's saying that his security experts are constantly hard at work.
[00:10:38.048 --> 00:10:41.530]  They're putting up safeguards to prevent terrorists from entering the country.
[00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:51.876]  But this is at the same time that they just passed that $1.1 trillion omnibus bill that allows an additional 300,000 refugees to enter the country.
[00:10:52.296 --> 00:10:57.518]  With a failed vetting system, as they could say, those federal background checks do not work.
[00:10:58.278 --> 00:11:05.882]  And check this out, the Obama administration has no idea where thousands of potential terrorists are.
[00:11:06.302 --> 00:11:10.023]  They do not know the whereabouts of thousands of people.
[00:11:10.463 --> 00:11:18.467]  There were more than 100,000, in fact, that have had their visas revoked since 2001 over terror concerns and for other reasons.
[00:11:18.847 --> 00:11:21.148]  Now, this is according to a State Department official.
[00:11:22.528 --> 00:11:28.412]  And they said they have no clue where more than 100,000 of these people are.
[00:11:28.532 --> 00:11:39.538]  So they revoked their visas, they're roaming around the United States, and they had their visas revoked due to terrorism concerns, and they have absolutely no idea where they are.
[00:11:39.838 --> 00:11:49.463]  Now, of course, this admission comes as members of this committee were pressing the administration on what safeguards are in place to reduce the risk from would-be extremists.
[00:11:49.823 --> 00:11:50.844]  And so then it comes out that
[00:11:51.184 --> 00:11:54.606]  Yeah, well, lo and behold, we have no idea where these people are.
[00:11:54.666 --> 00:11:56.667]  So, I mean, just a total failure.
[00:11:57.348 --> 00:11:58.689]  And the U.S.
[00:11:58.709 --> 00:12:05.653]  government, of course, they're trying to explain how they examine the backgrounds of people who are seeking entry to the country.
[00:12:06.013 --> 00:12:14.358]  But while they're doing all of this, they're passing the Omnibus Bill that is allowing hundreds of thousands of people who will not be vetted properly into the country.
[00:12:14.779 --> 00:12:17.600]  So it's just a huge cluster there.
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.161]  Now, here is one when.
[00:12:20.362 --> 00:12:24.885]  This is a win for people who are fighting back against mandatory vaccinations.
[00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:26.306]  This is in Indiana.
[00:12:26.907 --> 00:12:31.270]  Parents were able to stop the state's unethical HPV vaccine push.
[00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.671]  Now this is a Jeffrey Jackson article.
[00:12:34.412 --> 00:12:48.982]  He reports that it took exactly one month to the day for an activated Indiana population to turn back efforts by their state's health department to coerce and pressure parents into having this potentially dangerous HPV vaccine.
[00:12:49.503 --> 00:12:49.683]  Now,
[00:12:50.504 --> 00:12:51.405]  We reported on this.
[00:12:51.485 --> 00:12:52.186]  I interviewed him.
[00:12:52.246 --> 00:12:59.675]  It was because parents were alerted to this because their children were put on this vaccine tracker list that the parents never consented to.
[00:12:59.995 --> 00:13:05.161]  They were very upset about this breach of privacy there and so of course they flooded
[00:13:05.982 --> 00:13:17.169]  Those offices made phone calls protesting the intrusion by the state's government and eventually the state officials came and they were forced to comply with these parents who were extremely concerned.
[00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:21.251]  You have to remember vaccines are a corporate product.
[00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:28.913]  Okay, and the fact that they make them mandatory is quite scary, especially considering that HPV, the vaccine, it only treats certain strains of it.
[00:13:29.093 --> 00:13:32.954]  It makes you three times more susceptible to other strains of HPV.
[00:13:32.974 --> 00:13:39.616]  HPV is known to go away on its own with a healthy immune system and with regular checkups at your doctor.
[00:13:40.036 --> 00:13:43.837]  So the fact that it's mandatory is quite frightening, but take a look at this.
[00:13:44.617 --> 00:13:53.304]  The author of a mandatory meningitis vaccine bill that was going on in New York State was busted having his hand in the pot, so to speak.
[00:13:53.965 --> 00:13:57.648]  He has investments in pharmaceutical and health companies to at least $100,000.
[00:13:57.708 --> 00:14:04.813]  And it's being alleged he has received more than $400,000 from the same interest group.
[00:14:04.853 --> 00:14:05.494]  So there you go.
[00:14:05.534 --> 00:14:10.418]  He makes it mandatory for your children to get a vaccine that he knows he's going to get a cut of.
[00:14:10.878 --> 00:14:12.920]  And that's the new world order for you folks.
[00:14:22.875 --> 00:14:36.446]  Newsweek, an 82-year-old magazine that has changed hands over the years and is now barely scratching at a profit, has, like many desperate publications in print media, become a regurgitation of elitist propaganda.
[00:14:36.586 --> 00:14:45.053]  So it comes as no surprise that Newsweek would produce an article of arrogant swill such as this, Star Wars Class Wars.
[00:14:47.754 --> 00:15:03.404]  While many dream of escaping Earth to settle on Mars, billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are working to make it possible.
[00:15:03.664 --> 00:15:14.771]  But finding a new home on the red planet will likely only be for the rich, leaving the poor to suffer as Earth's environment collapses and conflict breaks out.
[00:15:15.131 --> 00:15:17.212]  Well, good riddance, super rich.
[00:15:17.532 --> 00:15:22.394]  If you need help packing, there are millions of Americans that would be happy to oblige.
[00:15:22.694 --> 00:15:27.036]  Earth is in turmoil because of the super rich.
[00:15:27.376 --> 00:15:33.099]  Not the average citizen working 9 to 5, unyielding war, race division propaganda.
[00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:35.319]  Centralized banking systems.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.301]  Mega-corporations raking in huge profits while destroying the middle class.
[00:15:40.721 --> 00:15:41.621]  Income inequality.
[00:15:41.641 --> 00:15:43.581]  This is something I think we've all thought about.
[00:15:44.001 --> 00:15:47.942]  You know, I was working on that topic when I was still at Goldman Sachs.
[00:15:48.202 --> 00:15:50.483]  And, uh... And, uh... In which direction?
[00:15:50.503 --> 00:15:51.743]  Well, you're working on increasing it.
[00:15:51.823 --> 00:15:52.503]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:52.644 --> 00:15:53.584]  Make it wider.
[00:15:53.644 --> 00:15:57.665]  But, but... But, I think... Yeah, but...
[00:15:59.085 --> 00:16:09.594]  Carbon tax madness regulated in the name of phony climate science and terrorists funded by a black budget so the elite can win at their little global board game of risk.
[00:16:09.754 --> 00:16:19.783]  Not to mention the protected heroin industry, disappearing children, and sex slave trade as a result of the Luciferian doctrine many of the elite openly subscribe to.
[00:16:19.983 --> 00:16:26.808]  Plus, your Frankenstein monster ISIS would be left holding the bag if you rocketed off to another planet.
[00:16:27.068 --> 00:16:31.551]  Trust me, ISIS doesn't want to deal with 300 plus million angry Americans.
[00:16:31.771 --> 00:16:34.593]  The ISIS threat would be gone in a heartbeat.
[00:16:34.814 --> 00:16:37.536]  And please, save a seat for everyone in Congress.
[00:16:37.716 --> 00:16:47.943]  With those idiots gone, and our Constitution and rights fully adhered to and represented, we would plot a course for thousands of years of happiness, prosperity, and liberty.
[00:16:48.303 --> 00:16:50.866]  On Spaceship Earth, Manny continues.
[00:16:51.127 --> 00:16:56.473]  This is the unspoken flip side of Musk's SpaceX and Bezos' Blue Origin.
[00:16:56.693 --> 00:17:03.782]  The space travel companies say they are creating a way for the human species to endure by populating other planets.
[00:17:04.082 --> 00:17:08.763]  But the bottom line is that only the wealthy will have the means to move to Mars.
[00:17:09.183 --> 00:17:15.044]  Musk's target ticket price is $500,000 a person in 2015 dollars.
[00:17:15.304 --> 00:17:16.724]  And that's just to get there.
[00:17:17.004 --> 00:17:21.145]  Imagine the new outfits you'll have to buy to go with that space helmet.
[00:17:21.465 --> 00:17:22.405]  Seriously, Manny?
[00:17:22.725 --> 00:17:23.246]  What is this?
[00:17:23.406 --> 00:17:25.286]  Lifestyles of the rich and brainless?
[00:17:25.606 --> 00:17:30.707]  We all know the real reason the super-rich want to leave with their tails between their legs.
[00:17:31.107 --> 00:17:33.588]  The sleeping giant's eyes are opening.
[00:17:33.848 --> 00:17:41.011]  The wealthy are purchasing secret hideaways in remote locations in order to escape social upheaval and possible riots.
[00:17:41.191 --> 00:17:46.233]  Sign this little scrap of paper and you get your bottle absolutely free!
[00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:57.297]  I hereby turn over to ISM Incorporated everything I have including my freedom and the freedom of my children and my children's children
[00:17:58.058 --> 00:18:02.285]  In return for which, said ism promises to take care of me forever.
[00:18:03.486 --> 00:18:10.116]  So from myself and the exponentially growing InfoWars audience, I have one question for the super-rich.
[00:18:10.597 --> 00:18:11.338]  When's your flight?
[00:18:11.739 --> 00:18:13.361]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.246]  Shane Steiner's involvement with InfoWarsLife.com truly happened in an organic way.
[00:18:21.386 --> 00:18:24.109]  I went to high school with Shane, his brother, knew his parents well.
[00:18:24.309 --> 00:18:29.995]  And he was visiting the office once, hadn't been to the office in years, and said, wow, I notice you're making and selling supplements.
[00:18:30.015 --> 00:18:30.776]  Do these really work?
[00:18:30.816 --> 00:18:35.862]  Because I've tried a lot of supplements as a workout enthusiast, and I really think most of them are hype.
[00:18:35.902 --> 00:18:37.403]  And I said, here, take some home, try it.
[00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:44.048]  Well, a few weeks later, he came in, blown away, and said, I want to buy three boxes of this stuff to give my friends and family.
[00:18:44.468 --> 00:18:45.969]  It's simply amazing.
[00:18:46.009 --> 00:18:47.290]  He said, why does it work so well?
[00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:51.854]  And I said, listen, go to Infowarslife.com, watch the informational videos with Dr. Group and others.
[00:18:52.074 --> 00:18:53.575]  They understand how it all works.
[00:18:53.855 --> 00:18:55.436]  I know that it works for me.
[00:18:55.556 --> 00:18:56.697]  That's all I understand.
[00:18:56.957 --> 00:19:02.001]  The science, the facts, the research, people's testimonials, they're all on Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:02.021 --> 00:19:03.002]  You can check it out for yourself.
[00:19:03.602 --> 00:19:04.683]  I wanted to go to the gym.
[00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:14.788]  I wanted to push myself and work out harder, and that led to me being able to come out and do stuff like the barefooting and the surfing and stuff like that, which I would have never done.
[00:19:14.808 --> 00:19:17.329]  I never would have done that two years ago.
[00:19:17.929 --> 00:19:21.551]  Shane has said over and over again, more than just libido and energy,
[00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:23.873]  It made him want to get into the gym more.
[00:19:24.214 --> 00:19:25.675]  It made him want to get in better shape.
[00:19:25.715 --> 00:19:28.338]  And believe me, the Steiners have amazing genetics.
[00:19:28.879 --> 00:19:31.322]  His brother is a world champion steer wrestler.
[00:19:31.662 --> 00:19:35.647]  His dad, Bobby Steiner, is a famous world champion bull rider.
[00:19:35.847 --> 00:19:37.509]  They've got natural genetics.
[00:19:37.949 --> 00:19:42.675]  But when you added this to the mix, in Shane's own words, it took him to the next level.
[00:19:54.972 --> 00:19:56.673]  Shane noticed the mental clarity.
[00:19:57.134 --> 00:20:00.616]  Bobby was able to work out longer and gain muscle mass.
[00:20:00.736 --> 00:20:02.037]  He's already completely shredded.
[00:20:02.237 --> 00:20:04.899]  I gotta admit, for me, the biggest effect has been libido.
[00:20:05.259 --> 00:20:11.303]  Now, I've never claimed to have a body like some beach model, but back when I was 20, 22 years old and worked out every day, I looked great.
[00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:17.368]  But over the years and being married, having three kids, working 18 hours a day, I gained basically 100 pounds.
[00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:20.650]  And it's been a long process of losing that weight in the last four years.
[00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.392]  But if you look at the photos and the videos,
[00:20:23.752 --> 00:20:24.112]  We're good to go.
[00:20:42.837 --> 00:20:52.901]  This has actually made me feel so good that here lately, about a year ago, I started training jiu-jitsu and that kind of led to doing some boxing and kickboxing.
[00:20:52.921 --> 00:21:05.407]  I mean, it's amazing that two years ago I was on the couch and couldn't even tie my shoes and now I'm training with MMA fighters and just doing stuff that I never thought that I would be doing ever again.
[00:21:05.667 --> 00:21:07.528]  So, Supermail Vitality has
[00:21:08.408 --> 00:21:08.929]  I don't know.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.140]  You'll love it.
[00:22:03.065 --> 00:22:12.428]  Bottom line folks, you want to discover the power of super male vitality and super female vitality for yourself by visiting InfoWarsLife.com today or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.182]  My guest today is Joy Brighton.
[00:22:21.282 --> 00:22:26.049]  She's the author of Shariaism is Here, The Battle to Control Women and Everyone Else.
[00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:34.280]  Now Joy is a former Wall Street trader as well as a longtime champion of women's rights and it was out of this growing concern for a
[00:22:35.181 --> 00:22:37.842]  So, Joy, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:22:37.862 --> 00:22:42.442]  Now, you wrote this book in 2014, but it seems to be ever more prevalent and growing concern with this topic.
[00:22:42.502 --> 00:22:44.163]  Where did your concern with Shariaism begin?
[00:23:04.389 --> 00:23:08.332]  My concern began with September 11th, frankly, living in New York City.
[00:23:08.948 --> 00:23:18.574]  And I've always been very keen on women's rights, equal rights, and I started really learning about Sharia law and about the treatment of women across the globe.
[00:23:18.874 --> 00:23:26.538]  And as we learned more, as the internet became more globalized, I really started to see what was happening and the oppression of women in that part of the world.
[00:23:27.219 --> 00:23:30.561]  And I started noticing that coming into, actually, America.
[00:23:31.181 --> 00:23:35.603]  Many of our viewers probably have already seen women walking around in burkas and things like this.
[00:23:35.684 --> 00:23:36.384]  And the question is,
[00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:38.991]  Is that really appropriate?
[00:23:39.071 --> 00:23:41.875]  I mean, are these women, is this a choice that they have?
[00:23:41.955 --> 00:23:42.956]  Are they truly equal?
[00:23:43.017 --> 00:23:46.742]  How can you be treated equally when you're basically invisible in a tent?
[00:23:48.345 --> 00:23:49.846]  Yes, I do agree with that.
[00:23:50.427 --> 00:24:01.935]  You know, obviously we have, just like with Christianity or any religion, you'll have different levels, different ways of interpreting those religious texts, and so there is sort of a difference with that.
[00:24:02.136 --> 00:24:09.441]  So, what do you see with, like, maybe American Muslims versus their foreign counterparts that is maybe raising alarms?
[00:24:11.263 --> 00:24:15.526]  Well, surprisingly, we're actually seeing a lot of similarity.
[00:24:16.289 --> 00:24:22.850]  I mean, we're seeing, I mean, of course there are many Muslims who come to this country looking for freedoms and things like this.
[00:24:23.291 --> 00:24:33.713]  But what we're seeing that's very different about this particular immigrant group is that most immigrant groups, when they come over, the parents who come over still have their foot in their home countries.
[00:24:33.973 --> 00:24:40.134]  And the children grow up in America really understanding and embracing individual liberties.
[00:24:40.634 --> 00:24:42.855]  What we're seeing in this country is the reverse.
[00:24:43.115 --> 00:24:44.215]  We are seeing Muslims
[00:24:44.585 --> 00:24:55.349]  Parents coming to this country looking for freedom of religion and individual liberties, but what we're seeing is that their children, actually, are embracing a more fundamental Islam.
[00:24:55.829 --> 00:25:10.314]  And it has to do with a kind of Muslim-Islamic pride that's going on, which is good, and at the same time, it's not clear that these young people really understand the fundamental Islam.
[00:25:10.534 --> 00:25:12.655]  They're just proud of their Islamic heritage,
[00:25:13.328 --> 00:25:24.073]  But they're being educated in various places, which we can talk about, which is influencing them to maybe be more a little bit of accommodating to the fundamental side.
[00:25:24.093 --> 00:25:27.635]  And that's what we're kind of seeing this homegrown radicalism going on in this country.
[00:25:28.837 --> 00:25:35.782]  Sure, I would love to get into that because that's sort of, you know, one of the questions people have is where is this radicalization coming from?
[00:25:35.822 --> 00:25:36.742]  Is it from the mosques?
[00:25:36.822 --> 00:25:43.667]  Is it purely from social media, which is what Obama would like us to believe, that that's how we need to counter this?
[00:25:44.367 --> 00:25:46.369]  So yeah, where is this coming from?
[00:25:47.069 --> 00:25:48.650]  Well, I can tell you where it's not coming from.
[00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:52.533]  It generally is not coming from the parents who have emigrated here.
[00:25:53.033 --> 00:25:54.234]  It is not coming from them.
[00:25:55.093 --> 00:26:02.638]  Because we, you know, there's a pipeline in Minnesota, as an example, of many young people who have gone, at least two dozen, who have gone over to fight ISIS.
[00:26:03.179 --> 00:26:14.606]  And we know that their family members are afraid for them and had no idea that this was going on until they actually received a phone call from some of them in Somalia or Pakistan saying, here's where I am.
[00:26:14.626 --> 00:26:16.747]  So it's not coming from the families.
[00:26:17.108 --> 00:26:20.450]  Yes, there's a social media component of this.
[00:26:21.551 --> 00:26:23.592]  And at the same time, it's coming through the mosque.
[00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:30.593]  Not all mosques, but we do know that 80% of the mosques in this country are owned by Saudi Arabia.
[00:26:30.753 --> 00:26:41.899]  The title is actually owned by Saudi Arabia, and we're seeing this influx of this very radical, fundamental, what's called Wahhabi type of radical Islam being supported in a mosque network.
[00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:51.803]  And so, just for some Muslims out there that you say maybe they don't understand necessarily the roots, where do the lines get blurry?
[00:26:51.823 --> 00:26:55.749]  Or where should they even pay attention to where it could cross into extremism?
[00:26:57.199 --> 00:27:04.465]  Well, for example, we're seeing a lot of young black women and Latino women converting to Islam.
[00:27:04.845 --> 00:27:13.233]  Because the idea of having a community, of being part of something, a lot of these women are single, they have children, they're single mothers, they're looking for a family to join.
[00:27:13.813 --> 00:27:20.559]  And so they are wooed by some of these Muslim men who are very attractive, very Westernized, into
[00:27:21.272 --> 00:27:21.712]  I think?
[00:27:39.768 --> 00:27:40.289]  I think so.
[00:27:54.256 --> 00:27:56.417]  And of course, we know what her husband did.
[00:27:57.457 --> 00:27:57.617]  Right.
[00:27:57.657 --> 00:28:06.160]  And of course, we see that with just victims of domestic violence in general, how they say it's not as easy as people think to just leave, to get out.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.461]  Obviously, there's sort of a mental component there as well.
[00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:14.043]  So why do you think that this Shari'ism is a form of control?
[00:28:15.763 --> 00:28:23.586]  Well, Shari'ism is a form of control because if you think about religion, religion has rules for its members to follow, whatever religion you have.
[00:28:24.167 --> 00:28:28.773]  And so, for example, we'll take the religion of Islam, which should be protected under the First Amendment.
[00:28:28.793 --> 00:28:34.860]  So Islam has a rule, for example, that a Muslim must not criticize his prophet for sin.
[00:28:35.901 --> 00:28:36.862]  That's religion.
[00:28:37.483 --> 00:28:43.731]  But then when you cross the line and you say to me as a Muslim that I cannot criticize your prophet under fear of death,
[00:28:44.338 --> 00:28:46.558]  That all of a sudden has crossed the line.
[00:28:46.598 --> 00:28:50.579]  Now you're forcing your way of life on my way of life, and that's control.
[00:28:51.199 --> 00:28:55.200]  That is the difference, and the line that you cross is actually the Constitution.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:05.582]  So faith is rules that you voluntarily decide to follow on your own for your own personal benefit, and control is when you start forcing me to follow some rules.
[00:29:06.002 --> 00:29:09.803]  In this case, because those rules have some kind of religious basis to them,
[00:29:10.743 --> 00:29:14.186]  It's kind of getting a free pass as, well, maybe this is just religion.
[00:29:14.326 --> 00:29:15.807]  And no, this is not religion.
[00:29:15.827 --> 00:29:19.791]  This is political control, something which I and others are calling Shariaism.
[00:29:21.272 --> 00:29:25.656]  And so why do you think that it's been so successful in rooting itself here in the West?
[00:29:26.957 --> 00:29:38.726]  That's a good question, and because if you look at Nazism or Communism or Maoism, these were all also very much political movements of control that didn't grow the kind of roots that we're seeing here with Shariaism.
[00:29:38.746 --> 00:29:40.107]  And the reason for that is a couple.
[00:29:40.147 --> 00:29:44.730]  First of all, you've got this false cover of religion, the fact that this is a religion.
[00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:48.473]  And of course, if we think it's a religion, we're not going to be very sensitive about that.
[00:29:49.894 --> 00:29:55.298]  You have Muslim Brotherhood groups
[00:29:55.768 --> 00:30:00.169]  In this country that are that are saying, well, wait a minute, you know, this is these are social action groups.
[00:30:00.189 --> 00:30:01.430]  This is political action groups.
[00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:04.111]  This is this is this is again our religions.
[00:30:04.131 --> 00:30:05.611]  You've got the false cover of religion.
[00:30:06.311 --> 00:30:12.933]  You've got a lot of dollars, tremendous amount of oil dollars, as you know, are fueling this terrorism and fueling this movement.
[00:30:12.973 --> 00:30:17.755]  You've got a lot of money behind this and you have got this political correctness where we're kind of
[00:30:18.422 --> 00:30:19.983]  I'm stepping on eggshells a little bit.
[00:30:20.023 --> 00:30:24.486]  You know, we're tiptoeing around this issue because we don't want to insult anybody.
[00:30:24.806 --> 00:30:36.074]  And so that cocktail of political correctness, of a lot of money driving this, of strong messaging driving this, and the cover of religion is enough to bring this over here in full force and in Europe.
[00:30:37.153 --> 00:30:37.713]  Absolutely.
[00:30:38.113 --> 00:30:39.334]  And of course we're seeing that.
[00:30:39.414 --> 00:30:42.074]  We saw that here with the last Democratic debate.
[00:30:42.094 --> 00:30:45.315]  They were so afraid to say those words, radical Islam.
[00:30:45.775 --> 00:30:49.216]  Why do you think there is such an issue here with uttering those words?
[00:30:52.136 --> 00:30:57.657]  I think that there's a real lack of understanding of what the difference between a radical Islam and Islam is.
[00:30:57.817 --> 00:30:59.658]  And there's such a sensitivity about this.
[00:31:00.438 --> 00:31:00.838]  Which is,
[00:31:03.263 --> 00:31:21.374]  Surprising and shocking because the amount of information that we have, the proof that we have, that the Muslim Brotherhood is a network that operates in this country and other countries, just like it operates in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates and elsewhere, which is the brains and the strategy and the funding mechanism for radical Islam.
[00:31:21.454 --> 00:31:24.116]  And yet no one will say Muslim Brotherhood in this country.
[00:31:24.176 --> 00:31:25.697]  No one will say radical Islam.
[00:31:27.718 --> 00:31:31.080]  If I can take a minute and I can say this, our coalition
[00:31:31.852 --> 00:31:32.773]  Thank you so much.
[00:31:48.132 --> 00:31:51.434]  Very difficult move for Saudi Arabia and for the Emirates to ban the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:31:51.474 --> 00:31:52.934]  Of course, we know Egypt did it as well.
[00:31:53.434 --> 00:31:56.576]  However, in this country, we're not willing to do that.
[00:31:56.616 --> 00:32:05.960]  So if we're part of a coalition and we see our coalition allies taking certain tactics, shouldn't we be looking at this and saying, why have you banned the Muslim Brotherhood?
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.862]  What is the relationship between that and ISIS?
[00:32:09.402 --> 00:32:11.703]  And we should be taking their lead, which we are not.
[00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.831]  Absolutely.
[00:32:13.211 --> 00:32:15.595]  Well, now, Joy, I want you to just hang on just a moment.
[00:32:15.615 --> 00:32:16.796]  We're going to take a quick break.
[00:32:17.157 --> 00:32:19.159]  When we get back, I want you to break it down.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.604]  What can we possibly do to halt this here in our country?
[00:32:22.644 --> 00:32:24.687]  What can we do to protect ourselves?
[00:32:25.148 --> 00:32:25.788]  So we'll be right back.
[00:32:27.146 --> 00:32:36.409]  You guys have the exclusive for which is a product called Deep Cleanse and why I'm so excited about it is it's a unique formula almost like the iodine crystals.
[00:32:36.509 --> 00:32:40.270]  We have two unique products that nobody in the world has.
[00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:52.434]  One of the most amazing ingredients in the world and it's called Shilajit and it's actually known as blood of the mountain or rock sweat because thousands of years ago as a matter of fact this ingredient
[00:32:52.634 --> 00:32:59.038]  Was only given to the elite of the elite thousands of years ago up in the Himalayan mountains and in Tibet.
[00:32:59.078 --> 00:33:02.901]  And we wanted to put this in stuff for a couple years, but we couldn't get an organic form.
[00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:03.301]  Right.
[00:33:03.401 --> 00:33:04.422]  I mean, let's explain.
[00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:07.624]  I mean, this stuff's so good, we couldn't put it out for years.
[00:33:07.904 --> 00:33:16.353]  Right, so I had to actually, it's kind of like the iodine crystals, finding a source deep in the earth that we could get the cleanest source available.
[00:33:16.793 --> 00:33:26.363]  But in Tibet and in Nepal and in the Himalayan mountains, thousands of years ago they found, they watched these monkeys and during the summer months the monkeys would go up into the mountains.
[00:33:26.384 --> 00:33:27.625]  Now you're being racist against monkeys.
[00:33:27.665 --> 00:33:28.306]  And they would pick
[00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:31.207]  This black substance from the mountains.
[00:33:31.668 --> 00:33:38.171]  And so in Russia, they actually, it grows in Russia and the mountains and in the Himalayas and only in the summer.
[00:33:38.272 --> 00:33:46.476]  And shilajit is actually the decomposition of seven, up to 7,000 different medicinal herbs.
[00:33:46.536 --> 00:33:53.200]  So it decomposes, all these different herbs decompose in the Himalayan mountains and the volcanic soil up there.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.483]  And what happens in the summertime... So it's almost like an oil from
[00:33:58.343 --> 00:34:01.046]  Yes, it's high in fulvic acid, it's high in humic acid.
[00:34:01.086 --> 00:34:05.411]  Because they're always claiming oil is really from decomposed animals and plants.
[00:34:05.972 --> 00:34:10.417]  There is some oil that is based from fossils, but most of it's really abiotic.
[00:34:10.818 --> 00:34:14.823]  So this is a true fossil source?
[00:34:14.843 --> 00:34:15.583]  I mean, explain it to me.
[00:34:16.284 --> 00:34:16.624]  It is.
[00:34:17.024 --> 00:34:22.345]  It's really the decomposition, like I said, of over 7,000 different medicinal herbs and plants.
[00:34:22.505 --> 00:34:26.306]  And with the rocks and the pressure deep in the mountains, it freezes.
[00:34:26.386 --> 00:34:31.327]  And during the summertime and the pressures build it up, it oozes out.
[00:34:31.427 --> 00:34:33.007]  So it literally oozes out of the mountain.
[00:34:33.027 --> 00:34:33.827]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:34.187 --> 00:34:35.188]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:35.228 --> 00:34:38.348]  It's black and it's highly nutritious.
[00:34:39.188 --> 00:34:41.809]  Even in the 1980s, when the Olympic
[00:34:42.529 --> 00:34:44.850]  Athletes in Russia were accused of being on steroids.
[00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:52.231]  They found out that they were actually been given Shilajit because it works as an anabolic as well and it builds muscles.
[00:34:52.431 --> 00:34:53.491]  It's a big dose in there.
[00:34:53.511 --> 00:35:03.234]  The second big main ingredient in there is a volcanic zeolite concentrate and what this formula is designed to do, the Shilajit and the zeolites have a real strong negative charge.
[00:35:03.694 --> 00:35:08.615]  All the metals and chemicals and PCBs and VOCs have positive charges.
[00:35:09.415 --> 00:35:17.522]  So these go in, they grab it, and then they safely eliminate it through the body so you can become healthy.
[00:35:17.563 --> 00:35:21.506]  I mean, this is an amazing formula.
[00:35:21.646 --> 00:35:27.512]  I wish I actually had it, but because this was an exclusive InfoWars Life product, you're the only one in the world that has.
[00:35:28.132 --> 00:35:36.039]  This formula now and, you know, there is going to be a limited supply available when you sell out because you can only harvest this once a year.
[00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:37.260]  How do people take it?
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.622]  How is it recommended that this be done?
[00:35:39.722 --> 00:35:41.424]  Just a daily dose?
[00:35:41.704 --> 00:35:43.446]  Yeah, daily dose.
[00:35:43.526 --> 00:35:44.907]  The instructions are on the label.
[00:35:44.927 --> 00:35:48.330]  You know, of course, I kind of modify it for each individual.
[00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:49.931]  It depends on what your lifestyle is.
[00:35:49.971 --> 00:35:55.076]  I mean, honestly, the best thing to do is for you to avoid all these chemicals and toxins in your environment.
[00:35:55.376 --> 00:35:55.456]  Yeah.
[00:36:17.495 --> 00:36:18.396]  These aren't just great products.
[00:36:18.416 --> 00:36:20.198]  This is how we fund this independent operation.
[00:36:20.218 --> 00:36:25.424]  We're not taxpayer-funded like MSNBC or NPR, and neither is your local station, so support them, folks.
[00:36:25.624 --> 00:36:26.245]  This is a war.
[00:36:30.461 --> 00:36:30.941]  Welcome back.
[00:36:31.001 --> 00:36:32.262]  I'm speaking with Joy Brighton.
[00:36:32.342 --> 00:36:37.166]  She is the author of Shariaism is Here, The Battle to Control Women and Everyone Else.
[00:36:37.606 --> 00:36:45.852]  Now, right before we went to break, you were speaking about the Muslim Brotherhood and how the first thing Saudi Arabia did was, you know, kick the Muslim Brotherhood out of their country.
[00:36:45.952 --> 00:36:47.353]  Why have we not done that here?
[00:36:47.513 --> 00:36:49.815]  Why are we so afraid to even utter those words?
[00:36:50.315 --> 00:36:56.540]  What do you think about other organizations that are here, such as CARE, that purport to represent American Muslims?
[00:36:57.745 --> 00:36:59.166]  Well, you know, it's interesting.
[00:36:59.186 --> 00:37:05.948]  As I said, the Emirates also banned the Muslim Brotherhood, and they went so far as to actually list 82 Muslim Brotherhood front groups.
[00:37:06.428 --> 00:37:10.330]  Two of them were the largest Muslim civil liberties groups in America.
[00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:17.673]  One was CARE, Council of American Islamic Relations, and one was Muslim American Society, MAS, were on the list.
[00:37:17.993 --> 00:37:22.095]  The Obama administration said, wait a minute, Emirates, you've made a mistake.
[00:37:22.375 --> 00:37:23.435]  These are not terror groups.
[00:37:23.775 --> 00:37:25.116]  These are just political action groups.
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:26.342]  In the United States.
[00:37:26.522 --> 00:37:29.470]  And the Emirates said, oh no, you've got it wrong.
[00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:30.713]  This is Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:37:31.482 --> 00:37:31.762]  Wow.
[00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:45.450]  And so now we have reports where there are actual Muslims, a lot of women as well, that are fighting back against honor killings and some of these more extreme views that you will have with Islam.
[00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:51.874]  And these Muslims are being called out by the regressive left, saying that that's hate speech.
[00:37:52.414 --> 00:37:57.517]  So they're not even allowed to speak about their own religion or things that are going on within their own community.
[00:37:59.793 --> 00:38:07.196]  Yeah, well this is, you know, Shariaism, movement of political control, okay, is like communism and Nazism.
[00:38:07.416 --> 00:38:12.018]  What is the most important element to control someone is to shut down political debate.
[00:38:12.378 --> 00:38:13.639]  You want to shut down debate.
[00:38:13.919 --> 00:38:19.581]  So if you say, well, what you're saying is hate speech and I'm going to criminalize that, that shuts the debate down.
[00:38:19.661 --> 00:38:20.862]  So what you're speaking about is
[00:38:21.882 --> 00:38:26.123]  There's women who are trying to talk about honor killings in this country.
[00:38:26.143 --> 00:38:34.285]  Ayaan Hirsi Ali is one of them, went to Brandeis, was supposed to be keynote speaker at the very end, and she is a women's rights activist and has been.
[00:38:35.666 --> 00:38:42.387]  Brandeis University said, well, you're very critical of Islam and we think this is hate speech, therefore we don't want you on campus.
[00:38:42.968 --> 00:38:44.448]  So this is censorship?
[00:38:44.844 --> 00:38:46.665]  This is control of information.
[00:38:46.726 --> 00:38:48.347]  This is control of free speech.
[00:38:48.727 --> 00:38:59.035]  And again, once you start controlling the information that people have, the only information that then we then hear about is coming from a side that's basically has a point of view.
[00:38:59.576 --> 00:39:04.640]  And so shutting down free speech and free political debate is very, very dangerous and very powerful.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.182]  Right, and this is something that's going on here in America.
[00:39:08.262 --> 00:39:09.323]  It's going on in the UK.
[00:39:09.363 --> 00:39:13.285]  We have actually these Sharia courts that are working in tandem.
[00:39:13.986 --> 00:39:21.491]  Women are going to these courts rather than the justice system that's set up in our country, and much to their detriment.
[00:39:21.991 --> 00:39:33.873]  They're getting advice from men, in most instances, that are going to probably take their husband's side and, you know, go with the more thousands-year-old rules with their religion.
[00:39:33.893 --> 00:39:35.293]  So why do you think that is?
[00:39:35.353 --> 00:39:41.094]  Why do you think young women involved here are so, I don't know, willing to submit?
[00:39:41.774 --> 00:39:50.656]  Well, remember, you know, these women, women who are women who end up going to Sharia court are women, by definition, who are involved in a fundamental household.
[00:39:51.736 --> 00:39:58.779]  And they are very much trapped and their only outlet is to go, they can't, if they go to an outside U.S.
[00:39:58.839 --> 00:40:06.962]  court, they will be threatened if not actually killed.
[00:40:06.982 --> 00:40:09.222]  We actually have honor killings in this country as well.
[00:40:09.603 --> 00:40:12.504]  So they're going to go, the only place that they know is the Sharia courts.
[00:40:13.786 --> 00:40:17.287]  The problem in this country is that we're saying that Sharia courts are okay.
[00:40:17.667 --> 00:40:26.289]  We've got to show young women that there is an alternative, and if this generation doesn't have the strength to go outside and go into the U.S.
[00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:28.030]  courts, maybe their daughters will.
[00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:36.232]  But if this generation of young women who are still going to their Sharia courts feels like they're not going to be protected anymore in a U.S.
[00:40:36.292 --> 00:40:42.454]  court of law, because people are going to say that this is just their religion and it's a domestic violence issue, then
[00:40:43.237 --> 00:40:47.000]  Then they're going to teach their daughters to go to Sharia courts also.
[00:40:48.021 --> 00:40:49.722]  So we really need to be the safety net.
[00:40:49.762 --> 00:40:52.564]  If these women are not using Sharia, not using U.S.
[00:40:52.604 --> 00:40:56.648]  courts now, we have to show them that should they choose to go to U.S.
[00:40:56.688 --> 00:40:58.869]  courts in the future, we will protect them.
[00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:08.437]  And we will not say that this is religious freedom, but we will actually say that this is oppression of women and it's against our Constitution and it's against equal rights.
[00:41:08.925 --> 00:41:09.505]  Absolutely.
[00:41:10.106 --> 00:41:12.487]  And now, what do you think about Donald Trump's calls?
[00:41:13.248 --> 00:41:18.851]  He was saying, let's put a temporary ban on bringing Muslims in the country until we can fix our vetting system.
[00:41:21.073 --> 00:41:22.794]  Well, I don't agree with that.
[00:41:23.374 --> 00:41:28.458]  However, I can offer up solutions to what I think is a better tactic.
[00:41:28.818 --> 00:41:36.743]  And what I'm very frustrated with is that everyone is so quick to jump on Trump and say, this is unconstitutional, left, right, and center.
[00:41:37.202 --> 00:41:40.064]  But what they're not saying, we're not hearing from any presidential candidate.
[00:41:40.104 --> 00:41:42.025]  Well, what would you propose?
[00:41:42.945 --> 00:41:44.426]  And I think it's very important.
[00:41:44.446 --> 00:41:46.247]  Let's not shoot the messenger here.
[00:41:46.327 --> 00:41:47.888]  We have a problem in this country.
[00:41:48.208 --> 00:41:49.769]  We've been unwilling to deal with it.
[00:41:50.209 --> 00:41:51.410]  And okay, fine.
[00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:52.891]  You don't want to ban on Muslims?
[00:41:53.211 --> 00:41:55.812]  Nor do I. Here's what I would propose.
[00:41:56.653 --> 00:41:57.173]  Are you ready?
[00:41:58.334 --> 00:41:58.854]  Give it to me.
[00:41:58.874 --> 00:42:01.876]  So what I would propose is, first of all,
[00:42:02.608 --> 00:42:07.211]  Deporting the entire extended family of a terrorist.
[00:42:07.771 --> 00:42:11.713]  Because these terrorists do not care about life or death.
[00:42:11.813 --> 00:42:16.236]  And as I mentioned before, generally their families are not involved in terrorism.
[00:42:16.256 --> 00:42:19.718]  And I can tell you that many of their extended families are not involved.
[00:42:20.158 --> 00:42:26.102]  However, they probably know that this particular family member is becoming radicalized.
[00:42:26.222 --> 00:42:27.362]  They are seeing that.
[00:42:28.043 --> 00:42:31.925]  And so they have a first view into saying something is happening.
[00:42:32.287 --> 00:42:34.388]  And they can police their own family members.
[00:42:34.628 --> 00:42:48.996]  If there's something at stake, if there is a risk that they themselves will be deported, unless they take that family member and put him back on the right track, then this is going to continue to be happening.
[00:42:49.836 --> 00:42:53.098]  And this is a very humane way of doing it.
[00:42:54.399 --> 00:42:56.120]  It's a very effective way of doing that.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:00.562]  We know Israel is revoking citizenship at this point also.
[00:43:01.061 --> 00:43:01.281]  Mm-hmm.
[00:43:02.002 --> 00:43:06.764]  And so that's one thing that you say that we could do to protect this country, protect ourselves.
[00:43:07.144 --> 00:43:08.205]  Any other suggestions?
[00:43:08.825 --> 00:43:26.375]  Well, the other suggestion is that we need to be, as Egypt, as Saudi Arabia, as the Emirates have done, we need to be looking into organizations that are, according to the Emirates themselves, are Muslim Brotherhood front groups, because these groups are the funding and the strategic network of ISIS.
[00:43:26.815 --> 00:43:27.795]  We need to be doing that.
[00:43:29.535 --> 00:43:37.065]  And, you know, it's hard to say this, but the fact of the matter is that we have a network in our mosques.
[00:43:37.365 --> 00:43:40.008]  Okay, there is a network of mosques that are radical mosques.
[00:43:40.549 --> 00:43:43.653]  Unfortunately, some of these mosques are not houses of prayer.
[00:43:43.933 --> 00:43:46.897]  They are Sharia, what I say, Sharia command and control centers.
[00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:49.391]  And we've got to face the facts on this.
[00:43:49.772 --> 00:43:52.574]  The Boston Marathon, why did it happen there?
[00:43:52.614 --> 00:43:55.576]  Because there is a radicalization hub within the mosque system there.
[00:43:55.856 --> 00:44:06.002]  We're seeing radical mosques throughout this country and we're going to have to, as France has been doing, is going and surveilling mosques and actually deporting some of these imams that are very fundamental.
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:09.660]  Well just about, we've got about two minutes left.
[00:44:09.721 --> 00:44:12.021]  So what do you want to say out there to Americans?
[00:44:12.101 --> 00:44:15.202]  Because obviously we have seen some hate crimes happening.
[00:44:15.262 --> 00:44:21.363]  People are going and spray painting mosques or throwing coffee on women who are wearing the headscarves and things.
[00:44:21.403 --> 00:44:23.444]  I mean that's not right, obviously.
[00:44:24.024 --> 00:44:33.526]  So what do you want to say to Americans out there as well as Muslim Americans to just be wary but also to kind of curtail this political correctness run amok?
[00:44:34.434 --> 00:44:42.681]  Well, listen, the more we talk about this openly, the less there is this tension, okay, to just throw coffee at someone, which is a horrible thing.
[00:44:43.042 --> 00:44:45.384]  We've got to talk about it like civilized people.
[00:44:45.444 --> 00:44:57.855]  We have to have a heated political debate, and heated political debates are very, very ugly, and there's a lot of mudslinging, and people call people bad names, but I'd rather be called a bad name than have coffee thrown in my face.
[00:44:58.215 --> 00:44:58.736]  Thank you.
[00:45:13.897 --> 00:45:27.288]  Absolutely, and that's why it is so important and why we do need to hold on to those values like the First Amendment that protects our political speech rather than, you know, Saudi Arabia is set to execute someone who was a teenager at a protest.
[00:45:27.528 --> 00:45:31.892]  And so, you know, that's what happens when we get rid of the First Amendment, things like that.
[00:45:32.292 --> 00:45:34.554]  Well, Joy Brayton, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:45:34.674 --> 00:45:41.080]  Obviously, this information is key, especially now, and I agree, you know, we need to be having some real discourse about this.
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:44.021]  The book is available on Amazon.com.
[00:45:44.381 --> 00:45:47.883]  It is Shariaism is Here, The Battle to Control Women and Everyone Else.
[00:45:48.343 --> 00:45:50.204]  Joy Brighton with joybrighton.com.
[00:45:50.604 --> 00:45:51.224]  Thank you so much.
[00:45:52.125 --> 00:45:54.666]  Stick around because we got more news coming up right after this.
[00:46:01.189 --> 00:46:01.889]  Qualifications.
[00:46:02.789 --> 00:46:04.770]  Rape, murder, arson and rape.
[00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:06.711]  You said rape twice.
[00:46:07.927 --> 00:46:08.548]  I like grape.
[00:46:09.309 --> 00:46:09.689]  Charming.
[00:46:09.729 --> 00:46:10.570]  Sign right here.
[00:46:37.981 --> 00:46:38.982]  Brain Force is here.
[00:46:39.523 --> 00:46:41.806]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:46:42.086 --> 00:46:49.936]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:46:50.714 --> 00:46:54.295]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:46:54.335 --> 00:46:56.675]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:46:57.035 --> 00:47:00.576]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:00.616 --> 00:47:03.757]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:04.257 --> 00:47:09.058]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:09.598 --> 00:47:11.458]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:47:11.818 --> 00:47:16.239]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:16.419 --> 00:47:18.440]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.520]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:20.920]  Exactly.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.762]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:25.262 --> 00:47:33.306]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:47:38.197 --> 00:47:43.202]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:47:43.443 --> 00:47:49.549]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:47:49.749 --> 00:47:56.717]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:47:57.057 --> 00:48:07.003]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:07.563 --> 00:48:13.486]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:13.726 --> 00:48:16.408]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:17.108 --> 00:48:17.568]  We're good.
[00:48:43.143 --> 00:48:44.064]  I think so.
[00:49:06.602 --> 00:49:13.487]  Back when I was a teenager in the 1980s, the first time I heard of cryo was on a news piece dealing with the Olympics.
[00:49:13.827 --> 00:49:20.052]  How the Russians would put their athletes in chambers and then bring it down over 200 degrees below zero.
[00:49:20.652 --> 00:49:22.033]  And then I kind of forgot about it.
[00:49:22.053 --> 00:49:28.035]  Then, about three years ago, my good friend Joe Rogan was visiting town, and he said, man, you've got to try this Cryo thing.
[00:49:28.515 --> 00:49:30.096]  I just went over to the first place in the U.S.
[00:49:30.116 --> 00:49:31.396]  that had it and tried it.
[00:49:31.516 --> 00:49:32.136]  It's amazing.
[00:49:32.717 --> 00:49:37.939]  Well, I kind of forgot about that, and then finally, a few weeks ago, was driving by the first Cryo.
[00:49:38.459 --> 00:49:39.679]  And I went in and started doing it.
[00:49:39.959 --> 00:49:40.319]  I love it.
[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:41.260]  And then it clicked.
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:57.714]  Well, I don't really do stories on sports stuff or fitness so much, but I do report on entrepreneurial ideas, innovations, medical innovations, stuff like that, especially if it ties into cultural memes like Star Wars.
[00:49:58.494 --> 00:50:03.137]  Kind of the global fairy tale narrative that George Lucas designed it to be.
[00:50:03.597 --> 00:50:12.282]  Because we do see Han Solo in the 1980 mega-hit Empire Strikes Back being basically frozen in a carbonite chamber.
[00:50:12.862 --> 00:50:15.744]  So I was thinking, did they get that idea from the Russians?
[00:50:16.104 --> 00:50:17.965]  Or did the Russians get that idea from them?
[00:50:18.506 --> 00:50:19.526]  Somebody should investigate that.
[00:50:19.546 --> 00:50:22.188]  It's an interesting factoid that I don't think we know the answer to.
[00:50:22.528 --> 00:50:27.211]  But regardless, they named the whole space-based weapons system to shoot down missiles
[00:50:28.011 --> 00:50:28.691]  Star Wars.
[00:50:28.731 --> 00:50:30.252]  That influenced Ronald Reagan and others.
[00:50:30.872 --> 00:50:45.916]  If you expand on that now, they are launching whole fleets of ships and whole squadrons of jets and larger aircraft with high-powered lasers that can vaporize tanks, shoot down missiles, shoot aircraft out of the sky from hundreds of miles away.
[00:50:46.297 --> 00:50:54.299]  So, InfoWars.com is here, investigating the link between Cryo and Star Wars, The Force Awakens.
[00:50:55.976 --> 00:51:00.678]  Or is it that life imitates art?
[00:51:29.995 --> 00:51:30.756]  Welcome!
[00:51:31.716 --> 00:51:32.476]  Oh my gosh.
[00:51:32.897 --> 00:51:36.538]  Life is definitely imitating art way too much.
[00:51:37.999 --> 00:51:38.980]  Has he arrived?
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.120]  Yes, Lord.
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:41.641]  He has arrived.
[00:51:42.021 --> 00:51:46.724]  This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze this rebel-fought criminal.
[00:51:47.564 --> 00:51:47.884]  Yes.
[00:51:48.424 --> 00:51:49.065]  Yes, Lord.
[00:51:50.225 --> 00:51:52.147]  I was just going to do a report on Cryo.
[00:51:52.368 --> 00:51:53.249]  I talked to the owner.
[00:51:53.369 --> 00:51:54.270]  They said it was cool the other day.
[00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:58.014]  Is this part of the new Star Wars movie promotion or something?
[00:51:58.054 --> 00:52:01.658]  Can I still go Cryo and shoot a report with my crew?
[00:52:02.119 --> 00:52:02.639]  Is that cool?
[00:52:02.679 --> 00:52:03.580]  I mean, what is this?
[00:52:03.841 --> 00:52:04.461]  Who are you?
[00:52:05.002 --> 00:52:05.743]  Yes, please.
[00:52:05.803 --> 00:52:07.225]  The chamber is this way.
[00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:09.971]  Well, thank you, Mr. Pig Creature.
[00:52:10.031 --> 00:52:13.632]  I mean, uh, sir, uh, Mr. Ooganaut.
[00:52:14.372 --> 00:52:21.955]  I, uh, guess I'll just go on in there and wait for you to come pull the lever for the carbonite or whatever they... It's kind of scary.
[00:52:36.527 --> 00:52:38.168]  Well, I guess it's safe.
[00:52:38.968 --> 00:52:42.610]  Kind of feels refreshing, but... Are you an exchange student?
[00:52:43.951 --> 00:52:45.532]  Are you one of those Syrian refugees, or...?
[00:52:45.592 --> 00:52:48.573]  I don't... I come from the same world as your president.
[00:52:48.993 --> 00:52:50.314]  You know it as your anus.
[00:52:51.134 --> 00:52:57.698]  Was this really imported from Russia, or... somewhere actually a long time ago in a... galaxy far, far away?
[00:53:10.285 --> 00:53:16.207]  Mr. Pink Creature, did you come here on a student visa, or are you a refugee from the Galactic War?
[00:53:16.227 --> 00:53:18.368]  I don't know, it's kind of hard to figure out.
[00:53:19.089 --> 00:53:23.710]  Did the CIA actually start the sectarian wars that brought the Empire in?
[00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:24.951]  Oh wait, that was episode three.
[00:53:25.031 --> 00:53:27.512]  Oh no, that was Iraq and Syria.
[00:53:27.532 --> 00:53:32.834]  I just keep mixing actual reality and Machiavellian stuff with fiction.
[00:53:34.855 --> 00:53:37.556]  Alright, thank you so much, Mr. Pink Creature.
[00:53:37.576 --> 00:53:39.037]  That was quite the experience.
[00:53:39.077 --> 00:53:39.637]  Thank you very much.
[00:53:43.257 --> 00:53:45.558]  You are free to use any means necessary.
[00:53:45.799 --> 00:53:46.739]  Is he undamaged?
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:52.522]  He seemed to enjoy it.
[00:53:54.063 --> 00:54:01.588]  Alright folks, we just had some fun.
[00:54:01.828 --> 00:54:04.930]  And I was five years old when Star Wars came out in the late 70s.
[00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:06.871]  So I know it's a big part of our culture.
[00:54:07.011 --> 00:54:07.431]  I like it.
[00:54:07.491 --> 00:54:08.012]  It's cheesy.
[00:54:08.072 --> 00:54:08.372]  It's fun.
[00:54:09.468 --> 00:54:21.775]  But we are going to live up to the title of this video that InfoWars is going to expose and basically leak Star Wars The Force Awakens.
[00:54:21.855 --> 00:54:23.976]  No, we're not going to leak to you the plot.
[00:54:23.996 --> 00:54:27.638]  We're not going to tell you what happens to Luke Skywalker or Chewbacca.
[00:54:28.098 --> 00:54:30.960]  We're going to tell you what the film now is really all about.
[00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:32.891]  David Knight's seen it.
[00:54:32.931 --> 00:54:33.671]  My crew's seen it.
[00:54:34.252 --> 00:54:35.753]  I've read the online synopsis of it.
[00:54:35.773 --> 00:54:36.894]  May not even bother seeing it.
[00:54:37.674 --> 00:54:45.941]  It is nothing but 110% pure Pentagon propaganda to get women to join the U.S.
[00:54:46.001 --> 00:54:46.481]  military.
[00:54:46.901 --> 00:54:49.784]  Just this month, the Pentagon came out and said, in all combat roles,
[00:54:50.464 --> 00:54:52.725]  They also admit it'll basically wreck the military.
[00:54:53.225 --> 00:54:59.949]  But they're coming in with machines to replace combat troops and replace pilots so they want to screw up the military.
[00:55:00.289 --> 00:55:02.030]  This is social engineering.
[00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:10.153]  Listen folks, I'm all for women having equal opportunity, but every Hollywood film that comes out that's an action movie or science fiction, the women are all the heroes.
[00:55:10.514 --> 00:55:14.055]  They are waging war against gender roles and against the family.
[00:55:14.575 --> 00:55:19.218]  You'd think World War III with Russia isn't important because all you hear about is Caitlyn Jenner.
[00:55:20.154 --> 00:55:21.795]  This is PC brainwashing.
[00:55:21.976 --> 00:55:22.916]  Look at the cover!
[00:55:23.577 --> 00:55:30.282]  And you don't have to see the film, where all the bad guys, the good guys, the heroes, the warriors that no one can beat are women!
[00:55:31.223 --> 00:55:31.403]  Really?
[00:55:31.443 --> 00:55:32.064]  Well, that was the truth.
[00:55:32.084 --> 00:55:33.385]  They'd be the top NFL players.
[00:55:33.405 --> 00:55:34.606]  They'd be the top boxers.
[00:55:34.666 --> 00:55:35.707]  It wouldn't be Muhammad Ali.
[00:55:36.387 --> 00:55:38.009]  It wouldn't be folks in the UFC.
[00:55:38.749 --> 00:55:39.250]  It's crazy.
[00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:40.251]  Men can't have babies!
[00:55:41.713 --> 00:55:44.555]  And women can't carry 100-pound packs on average, statistically.
[00:55:44.756 --> 00:55:46.377]  Most men can't perform at that level.
[00:55:47.217 --> 00:55:50.440]  It's like women aren't the top long-distance runners in the world up against men.
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:52.161]  It's black Kenyan men.
[00:55:52.522 --> 00:55:54.864]  It's because people and groups are different.
[00:55:55.811 --> 00:55:57.452]  We're all humans, but we have different skills.
[00:55:58.213 --> 00:56:01.456]  And there is a major agenda to screw up our society, bottom line.
[00:56:01.656 --> 00:56:11.625]  Now, David Knight is hosting the show live right now, but he saw it last night, and I wanted just to come in here, because he's about to come off break, and give us his take on the situation.
[00:56:11.645 --> 00:56:13.366]  David, you just heard my review of it.
[00:56:13.386 --> 00:56:14.447]  Oh yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:56:14.487 --> 00:56:15.628]  That's exactly what you saw.
[00:56:16.009 --> 00:56:19.532]  It's pushing this agenda of women in combat, and of course, the key
[00:56:20.132 --> 00:56:20.833]  We're good to go.
[00:56:50.012 --> 00:56:51.534]  David, you're back in about 30 seconds.
[00:56:51.554 --> 00:56:52.455]  I'm gonna let you get back on.
[00:56:52.495 --> 00:56:52.915]  Thank you.
[00:56:53.236 --> 00:56:55.578]  David Knight, with his son, also shot a report.
[00:56:55.918 --> 00:56:57.340]  That's at InfoWars.com.
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:59.442]  But listen, this is what this comes down to.
[00:56:59.883 --> 00:57:01.564]  This is a driven agenda.
[00:57:01.765 --> 00:57:02.605]  Every movie you see.
[00:57:03.697 --> 00:57:09.019]  We're not supposed to live in a country where Hollywood's completely controlled with total agenda-driven brainwashing.
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:10.800]  It's called totalitarianism.
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.021]  It's very, very dangerous.
[00:57:12.381 --> 00:57:13.541]  People should look into it.
[00:57:14.042 --> 00:57:19.924]  And your culture is freedom and liberty and the planet we're on and all this incredible beauty and mystery.
[00:57:20.344 --> 00:57:21.645]  The mystery isn't Star Wars.
[00:57:21.685 --> 00:57:23.946]  The mystery is the mystery of life and the universe.
[00:57:24.406 --> 00:57:25.587]  This is a false reality.
[00:57:25.647 --> 00:57:30.469]  Star Wars and all this to seduce us into a second life instead of the real life we have.

[00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:35.591]  There's a real war going on and it's not at Star Wars.
[00:57:35.931 --> 00:57:37.472]  It's going on for the future of humanity.
[00:57:37.712 --> 00:57:41.514]  Because if you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:57:45.916 --> 00:57:47.437]  Thank you for watching the show tonight.
[00:57:47.517 --> 00:57:49.818]  We'll see you again here Monday at 7 p.m.
[00:57:49.878 --> 00:57:50.218]  Central.
[00:57:55.973 --> 00:58:05.540]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[00:58:06.001 --> 00:58:07.742]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:58:07.902 --> 00:58:08.463]  Think about it.
[00:58:08.663 --> 00:58:14.447]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:58:14.707 --> 00:58:20.272]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:58:20.652 --> 00:58:32.422]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:58:32.682 --> 00:58:35.465]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:58:35.645 --> 00:58:38.127]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:58:38.447 --> 00:58:42.911]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:58:43.331 --> 00:58:43.892]  Think about it.
[00:58:48.823 --> 00:58:49.964]  Knockout is back.
[00:58:50.304 --> 00:59:01.411]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[00:59:01.831 --> 00:59:03.532]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:03.993 --> 00:59:13.158]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:13.539 --> 00:59:15.320]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.761]  It's the same price
[00:59:17.481 --> 00:59:23.364]  As leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece, it has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult.
[00:59:23.904 --> 00:59:30.148]  It's got the GABA, so it would probably cost $50 to take all this as separate pills.
[00:59:30.648 --> 00:59:30.768]  It's $19.95.
[00:59:31.488 --> 00:59:33.830]  You take one or two of these,
[00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:38.213]  And it just is really clean restful sleep is what the reviews are.
[00:59:38.554 --> 00:59:42.477]  It's what I've experienced and it just synergistically puts everything in there.
