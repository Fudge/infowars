[00:00:11.308 --> 00:00:14.131]  Hi, I'm Rex Jones, reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:23.179]  I'm here at the Greenbelt in Austin, where most people here think that pollution, such as littering and runoff, are the two biggest problems in our world today.
[00:00:23.459 --> 00:00:25.541]  And if you look around here, that's easy to see.
[00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:33.529]  There are things such as empty beer cans, beer bottles, abandoned shirts, abandoned pants, styrofoam cups, all sorts of pollutants.
[00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:36.652]  We've picked up a little bit of garbage from our surrounding area.
[00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:44.986]  But this is just a small version of the landfills and dirty creeks and rivers that the government likes to paint in our head as an idea of pollution.
[00:00:45.586 --> 00:00:49.628]  What they're really trying to cover up is much bigger than a little landfill.
[00:00:49.848 --> 00:00:52.209]  In fact, it is starting to consume the whole world.
[00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:53.149]  What is it?
[00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:54.470]  You're about to find out.
[00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:03.394]  We've talked about garbage on the ground.
[00:01:03.754 --> 00:01:05.695]  What about the garbage in our rivers and streams?
[00:01:06.738 --> 00:01:20.566]  This garbage is called runoff, and it drifts through our whole planet's water system of rivers, lakes, and oceans to form a giant trash continent in the Pacific Ocean, which I'm gonna coin Gargia.
[00:01:21.087 --> 00:01:23.688]  Is Gargia the biggest threat to the environment today?
[00:01:24.048 --> 00:01:24.669]  I think not.
[00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.276]  But before we leave the water, let's separate the facts and myths of the Pacific Island Garbage Patch.
[00:01:34.757 --> 00:01:38.821]  First, it's not a giant island of garbage as depicted in this picture here.
[00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:50.753]  It's actually made up of very small and microscopic pieces of plastic that covers 5,000 square kilometers in the North Pacific Gyre, where the Jet Stream and Southern Trade Winds create a giant circling region of water.
[00:01:51.213 --> 00:01:53.874]  Another myth is that plastic is killing animals.
[00:01:54.214 --> 00:02:01.835]  While it's true that plastic is being found in the stomachs of dead birds and fish, it's not yet known if the plastic is the actual cause of death.
[00:02:02.095 --> 00:02:09.457]  Also, small water insects, crabs, and barnacles have thrived on the particles and are now found in abundance across the ocean.
[00:02:09.737 --> 00:02:16.458]  In addition to being an eyesore and potentially deadly to marine life, runoff is not the biggest problem we face in our environment.
[00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:19.499]  Now let's take to the skies and cover a different kind of pollution.
[00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:29.172]  Air pollution has been with us since humans first learned how to harness fire.
[00:02:29.272 --> 00:02:38.801]  In 1952, pollutants from factories and home fireplaces mixed with air condensation killed at least 4,000 people in London over the course of several days.
[00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:48.789]  A few years earlier, in 1948, severe industrial air pollution created a deadly smog that asphyxiated 20 people in Denora, Pennsylvania and made 7,000 more sick.
[00:02:50.891 --> 00:02:56.574]  Acid rain, first discovered in the 1850s, was another problem resulting from coal-powered plants.
[00:02:56.854 --> 00:03:05.877]  Regulations and technology have helped clean up most of these problems, so now pollution is not as much of a problem in developed first world nations.
[00:03:06.338 --> 00:03:11.600]  In China and other emerging countries, air pollution is a huge problem and it's spread through the jet stream.
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:21.167]  Mercury, black carbon, dust, and ozone are just a few of the pollutants that are carried by the jet stream over the Pacific Ocean and are being dumped in the United States.
[00:03:21.527 --> 00:03:30.194]  Currently, China is building up to four dirty coal-burning power plants a month and consumes over four times the coal than the United States.
[00:03:30.494 --> 00:03:40.442]  Obama led EPA regulations that will shutter most of our coal-burning plants by 2030 so you can look forward to the higher power prices and breathing the dirty air produced by China.
[00:03:41.181 --> 00:03:45.904]  Another environmental danger is called CCD or Colony Collapse Disorder.
[00:03:46.344 --> 00:03:49.846]  This happens when a hive of bees is unexplainably wiped out.
[00:03:50.126 --> 00:03:57.611]  Nearly all CCD is being caused by either RFID radiation or Monsanto pollen that bees carry to other normal crops.
[00:03:58.511 --> 00:04:04.234]  Albert Einstein once said that if the bees were wiped out, all of humanity would vanish within four years.
[00:04:05.094 --> 00:04:16.419]  Recently, Harvard researchers linked pesticide use, specifically neonicotinoid insecticides, to act as nerve poisons and mimic the effects of nicotine as a major cause of colony collapse disorder.
[00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:21.441]  Over the last six years, American beekeepers have lost 30% of their hives each winter on average.
[00:04:23.382 --> 00:04:29.386]  And as companies like Monsanto keep producing neonicotinoid insecticides, future colony collapses are guaranteed.
[00:04:31.527 --> 00:04:34.869]  Now let's look at an unseen pollutant, nuclear radiation.
[00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:49.297]  We don't know what the exact full fallout from the nuclear bomb testing and leaks from nuclear power plants are, but the issue was brought to the forefront when the Fukushima power plant reactors melted down after a tsunami hit Japan on March 11, 2011.
[00:04:57.048 --> 00:05:02.436]  Since that time, countless gallons of radioactive cooling water has poured into the Pacific Ocean.
[00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:10.868]  Radiation spikes have been found along West Coast beaches, and there are more and more reports about massive sea life die-offs and dead zones being created in the ocean.
[00:05:10.948 --> 00:05:12.511]  You can't see the radiation.
[00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:17.115]  But the effects and the rise of cancers and birth defects in Japan is a direct result.
[00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:25.081]  It's disasters like Fukushima, Chernobyl, and Three Mile Island are a full-scale nuclear war that could potentially end all life on Earth.
[00:05:25.221 --> 00:05:27.123]  But it is not the biggest threat to our environment.
[00:05:28.416 --> 00:05:40.203]  Now that we've covered litter, runoff, CCD, particulates coming in through the jet stream, and nuclear radiation coming from places like Fukushima, I'm about to tell you what I consider the biggest threat to humanity is.
[00:05:40.884 --> 00:05:41.464]  GMOs.
[00:05:42.024 --> 00:05:44.486]  The real danger is not what is seen, but what is unseen.
[00:05:45.126 --> 00:05:58.397]  Not only have GMOs been linked to numerous health problems, but the pollen blow-off from Monsanto farms to other normal farms is causing unseen and unprecedented mutation within the normal biosphere.
[00:05:59.017 --> 00:06:03.241]  Everything that we've talked about before this, we knew the dangers and we knew how to deal with it.
[00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:06.843]  But with GMO crops, the answer still remains a mystery.
[00:06:07.064 --> 00:06:12.228]  Because we don't know what's going to happen within these mutations after three or four generations have passed.
[00:06:12.768 --> 00:06:15.851]  Here's our friend Jeffrey Smith to talk about GMOs and their dangers.
[00:06:16.811 --> 00:06:23.797]  Of all of the toxins that are released into the environment, GMOs are of a special class.
[00:06:24.778 --> 00:06:29.562]  You see, with genetic engineering, you have pollution of the gene pool.
[00:06:30.322 --> 00:06:32.804]  It's a self-propagating genetic pollution.
[00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:39.410]  The genes that we released in this generation already can outlast nuclear waste.
[00:06:40.396 --> 00:06:41.717]  They can go on forever.
[00:06:41.757 --> 00:06:45.920]  We have no technology to fully clean up this type of pollution.
[00:06:46.741 --> 00:06:55.308]  Certainly we can reduce it dramatically, but until we have some technique to identify GMOs at a distance, we are stuck with GMOs possibly forever.
[00:06:55.908 --> 00:07:03.914]  Imagine being hired by a company that says, we have a little problem, we'd like you to organize the recall of our salmon from the ocean.
[00:07:04.835 --> 00:07:07.857]  There's a company that wants to introduce genetically modified mosquitoes.
[00:07:08.518 --> 00:07:10.039]  Imagine trying to do a recall there.
[00:07:10.862 --> 00:07:15.504]  GM pollen has already contaminated the indigenous corn varieties of Mexico.
[00:07:16.305 --> 00:07:18.526]  And we have no technology to clean that up.
[00:07:19.006 --> 00:07:21.747]  What we've done is irreversible damage.
[00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:26.229]  And this is something that is highly irresponsible, unconscionable.
[00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.512]  And it was done over the objections of scientists, over the objections of science.
[00:07:32.364 --> 00:07:34.806]  A collusion between government and industry.
[00:07:35.186 --> 00:07:38.248]  There are two main reasons why people genetically modify foods.
[00:07:38.928 --> 00:07:41.410]  They either drink poison or produce poison.
[00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.292]  The poison drinkers are called herbicide tolerant.
[00:07:45.792 --> 00:07:47.853]  Most popular variety is Roundup Ready.
[00:07:48.474 --> 00:07:49.154]  Let me explain.
[00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:57.259]  Monsanto scientists found bacteria growing in a chemical waste dump near their factory, surviving in the presence of their herbicide called Roundup.
[00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:00.241]  So they had the brilliant idea, let's put it in the food supply.
[00:08:00.894 --> 00:08:09.456]  So they took the gene from the bacterium that allowed it to survive applications of Roundup, and put it into soybean, corn, cotton, canola, etc.
[00:08:09.956 --> 00:08:18.559]  So now you can spray the field with Roundup, and it kills all of the other plant biodiversity in the field, but not the Roundup-ready soy and Roundup-ready corn.
[00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:22.920]  The other variety of genetically modified crops produces a poison.
[00:08:23.673 --> 00:08:38.919]  They take a gene from a soil bacterium that produces a natural insecticide and put it into the DNA of the plant so every single cell of every single plant in millions of acres has its own little spray bottle that can kill an insect by destroying its digestive system.
[00:08:39.359 --> 00:08:48.663]  What these changes mean is that the plant might produce more allergens, more toxins, more anti-nutrients, more carcinogens, or even less of these.
[00:08:48.703 --> 00:08:49.244]  We don't know.
[00:08:49.304 --> 00:08:50.224]  It's a genetic roulette.
[00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:56.953]  In fact, the process of approval of these GM crops do not evaluate these type of changes.
[00:08:57.353 --> 00:09:14.339]  In Monsanto's own studies, which they conveniently left out of their published paper, which we will cover later, they found that in cooked GM soy, there was as much as seven times more of a known allergen called trypsin inhibitor, and about a doubling of an anti-nutrient called soy lectin, which blocks the absorption of certain nutrients.
[00:09:15.077 --> 00:09:22.462]  In fact, when they looked at that corn variety they found 43 different proteins that had significantly changed their levels of expression because of the genetic insertion.
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:43.447]  So these could be caught wreaking havoc with our health or the environment, but no one has evaluated them.
[00:09:43.467 --> 00:09:49.793]  Genetically modified foods and crops are one of the most dangerous health and environmental catastrophes we're facing.
[00:09:50.514 --> 00:09:52.136]  And yet very few people know about it.
[00:09:52.997 --> 00:09:57.262]  Now you know why we here at InfoWars believe that GMOs are the biggest threat to our planet today.
[00:09:58.149 --> 00:10:02.933]  We know the true dangers of a cigarette butt left flying out unattended in a field.
[00:10:03.374 --> 00:10:05.596]  But do we really know the dangers of GMOs?
[00:10:06.016 --> 00:10:07.537]  And can we trust our government to tell us?
[00:10:08.138 --> 00:10:10.280]  I'm Rex Jones reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:10:21.243 --> 00:10:29.106]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:10:29.366 --> 00:10:31.426]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:10:31.586 --> 00:10:34.227]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:10:34.287 --> 00:10:38.389]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment, and pushes Obamacare.
[00:10:38.709 --> 00:10:41.870]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:49.152]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:10:49.332 --> 00:10:53.456]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:10:53.656 --> 00:10:55.297]  We are the true media.
[00:10:55.457 --> 00:10:58.060]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.803]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
