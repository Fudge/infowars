[00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:21.286]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.686 --> 00:00:23.670]  Today is August 27, 2015.
[00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.494]  I'm your host Rob Doo, and here's a look at what's coming up.
[00:00:33.112 --> 00:00:40.414]  Now today at five o'clock our time here on East Coast Standard Time, we're going to have a press conference right over here across the street.
[00:00:40.434 --> 00:00:44.735]  They're going to actually bring us over and let us walk around, talk, ask questions.
[00:00:45.235 --> 00:00:47.676]  And I've got a few questions I'm going to ask too as well.
[00:00:47.696 --> 00:00:48.796]  So we're prepared for that.
[00:00:49.136 --> 00:00:54.778]  But one of the things that we know today is they found the LGBT flag in Flanagan's apartment.
[00:00:55.197 --> 00:01:02.022]  So what this means is, since he has the flag, that means he represents all gay, lesbian people.
[00:01:02.403 --> 00:01:04.404]  So I think he speaks for them all.
[00:01:04.484 --> 00:01:05.465]  It's a hate flag now.
[00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:10.249]  I think we should call for a full-out ban on that flag, just like they did in Charleston, Alex.
[00:01:10.589 --> 00:01:15.152]  I agree, because the Confederate battle flag, Robert E. Lee flag, was there.
[00:01:15.212 --> 00:01:19.896]  Historically it has nothing to do with oppressing black people, even though they say it does.
[00:01:21.097 --> 00:01:25.380]  Let's ban the rainbow flag now, and let's ban the Confederate flag.
[00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:06.667]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:07.028 --> 00:02:08.508]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:09.909]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:11.309]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.611]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:20.833]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:21.213 --> 00:02:22.693]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:22.713 --> 00:02:24.054]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:24.094 --> 00:02:26.215]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:43.274]  Well, our top story was going to be the fallout that has happened after the Virginia News shooting with all the anti-gunners and gun grabbers coming out of the woodwork calling to ban firearms from people.
[00:02:43.634 --> 00:02:49.975]  But earlier this afternoon we had, it looks like, a nationwide internet outage from Time Warner Cable.
[00:02:50.015 --> 00:02:59.438]  If you take a look at the Time Warner outage map here that I pulled up on my phone, you can see, wow, it's covering all of North America into Mexico, going into, looks like, Northern Columbia.
[00:03:00.498 --> 00:03:02.059]  But that is not the case.
[00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:05.541]  Actually, when you start zooming in on this, you can see a different story.
[00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:11.164]  The map actually gets a lot smaller, but they do really scare you with all the outages.
[00:03:11.204 --> 00:03:14.026]  And in fact, here's Jakari Jackson with a little more.
[00:03:15.206 --> 00:03:18.468]  There's been an Internet outage reported across the nation.
[00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.971]  And if you go to Downdetector.com, you can see the service area.
[00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.029]  affected in the United States.
[00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:33.272]  Now I'm not exactly sure how many different carriers are affected at this point but I know Time Warner Cable is definitely experiencing some problems.
[00:03:33.693 --> 00:03:48.518]  So if you were to look at this map you'd say wow that service area is quite intimidating but if you zoom in you can notice just from one zoom to the next the affected area decreased quite a bit and it continues to decrease the further and further in you go.
[00:03:48.838 --> 00:03:51.939]  Now there are cities like Austin Texas that are experiencing some problems
[00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:54.223]  Other areas of the country as well.
[00:03:54.683 --> 00:03:59.307]  So if you have a way to get a hold of us, if you have a way to leave a comment on this YouTube video.
[00:03:59.327 --> 00:04:04.631]  Like I said, your Time Warner cable may not work, but your phone may work or some other service provider.
[00:04:05.252 --> 00:04:08.655]  Give us a tip and let us know what's going on in your area.
[00:04:09.075 --> 00:04:11.337]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:04:13.621 --> 00:04:20.286]  And as a result of that nationwide Time Warner cable outage, some of the websites were not able to even pull up here in the studio.
[00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:25.189]  We're having our own little issues here, so we may be doing a little bit more overhead camera than normal.
[00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.410]  Let's get right into the news.
[00:04:26.911 --> 00:04:35.857]  Of course, we're going to start off with the tragedy that happened yesterday in Virginia with that guy who went off the rails and basically went postal on some former co-workers.
[00:04:35.897 --> 00:04:37.178]  Here we are from the Daily Mail.
[00:04:37.638 --> 00:04:39.680]  Exclusive, he was a human tape recorder.
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:47.404]  How TV murder was criticized by bosses for appalling journalistic standards and reprimanded for wearing an Obama badge to report on elections.
[00:04:48.284 --> 00:05:00.911]  Warped TV reporter Vester Lee Flanagan exasperated bosses with his stiff and nervous delivery, his inability to use a teleprompter, and by wearing a President Obama badge during an election report Daily Mail Online can reveal.
[00:05:01.491 --> 00:05:10.880]  Management at WDBJ dubbed the failed newsman the human tape recorder because he frequently parroted what interviews had told him rather than doing his own journalism.
[00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:19.129]  Flanagan 41 clashed repeatedly with photojournalists, belittling them in public and intimidating them with his violent temper according to eternal reports.
[00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:24.294]  He was also censored for wearing an Obama sticker while recording a segment at a polling booth during a 2012
[00:05:25.735 --> 00:05:25.995]  U.S.
[00:05:26.035 --> 00:05:30.517]  presidential election, a clear breach of journalistic impartiality.
[00:05:30.657 --> 00:05:44.921]  I would totally agree, and actually, if you go a couple more pages in the article, and here we can look at that November 9, 2012, I guess disciplinary report from, to Bryce Williams, which was his pseudonym he went by, from Dan Dennison.
[00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:51.083]  It has come to our attention that while standing in line Tuesday preparing to vote, you were wearing a President Obama sticker on your clothing.
[00:05:51.423 --> 00:05:51.864]  We're good to go.
[00:06:10.586 --> 00:06:21.215]  I guess nobody told that to George Stephanopoulos because he was actually admitted to giving Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation $50,000 and then was going to start running these debates.
[00:06:21.776 --> 00:06:26.340]  It took public pressure to get him to stop doing that, saying, hey, this guy is impartial.
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:35.944]  Journalists should be held impartial, especially when they're supposedly from this mainstream media and they're supposed to be impartial, even though we see them goading for certain candidates all the time.
[00:06:36.225 --> 00:06:39.546]  We wear our emotions here on our sleeve and who we root for.
[00:06:39.886 --> 00:06:43.048]  Definitely not for Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, or any of those ilk.
[00:06:43.088 --> 00:06:45.949]  And a lot of the Republicans aren't looking too good either.
[00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:48.530]  I just had to tweet somebody yesterday about Ben Carson.
[00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.411]  They're like, he's great.
[00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:51.232]  And I'm like, yeah, except for forced vaccination.
[00:06:51.812 --> 00:06:56.994]  You know, none of these people have freedom as their main signpost, and that's what we have to keep in mind.
[00:06:57.554 --> 00:07:01.535]  Speaking of people who not keep freedom as their signpost, here we have Obama.
[00:07:01.815 --> 00:07:04.356]  Here was his reaction to the shooting yesterday.
[00:07:04.696 --> 00:07:08.497]  It breaks my heart every time you read about or hear about these kinds of incidents.
[00:07:08.597 --> 00:07:13.579]  What we know is that the number of people who die from
[00:07:16.112 --> 00:07:23.598]  That's right, Obama.
[00:07:23.918 --> 00:07:24.579]  Blame the gun.
[00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:32.024]  You know, don't blame Fast and Furious, which was responsible for the deaths of, you know, several people in Mexico and the United States that we know of.
[00:07:33.125 --> 00:07:35.526]  Don't blame ISIS, the group that you're funding.
[00:07:35.907 --> 00:07:36.567]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:07:36.767 --> 00:07:38.668]  No, blame the inanimate object, the gun.
[00:07:39.088 --> 00:07:49.673]  Well, somebody with a little more sense, Donald Trump, actually had, you know, reason and logic behind what he said, not just behind this emotion that all guns are bad, except, you know, the President has his armed bodyguards.
[00:07:49.993 --> 00:07:52.235]  But that's okay, because you're not the President.
[00:07:53.115 --> 00:07:56.437]  In fact, here's what Donald Trump had to say when he was questioned about the incident.
[00:07:56.957 --> 00:07:59.138]  This isn't a gun problem, this is a mental problem.
[00:08:00.032 --> 00:08:07.223]  And frankly, you know, a case like this, he snuck up on him, whether it was a gun or a knife or whatever it would have been, it would have been something.
[00:08:07.964 --> 00:08:10.548]  But, you know, you're not going to get rid of all guns.
[00:08:10.628 --> 00:08:14.294]  So I know one thing, if you tried to do it, the bad guys would have them.
[00:08:18.936 --> 00:08:23.759]  He said more also.
[00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:27.861]  You can look at the article by Kurt Nemo, Trump, the problem is not guns, it's mental illness.
[00:08:27.901 --> 00:08:36.526]  Here he also says, in the old days they had mental institutions for people like this because he was really definitely borderline and definitely would have and should have been institutionalized.
[00:08:36.906 --> 00:08:38.287]  At some point somebody should have seen that.
[00:08:38.347 --> 00:08:40.328]  I mean people close to him should have seen it.
[00:08:40.928 --> 00:08:42.409]  But what else is going on here?
[00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:48.254]  There's also a new offensive against the Second Amendment because the victims of the people who died are now going to come out.
[00:08:48.594 --> 00:08:49.335]  They are goaded.
[00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:52.437]  They are trained to come out and say, hey, now we have to come after guns.
[00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:57.301]  And the father of the slain reporter told Fox News, the government has to do something about guns.
[00:08:57.802 --> 00:08:58.963]  At least he mentioned mental illness.
[00:08:59.483 --> 00:09:02.845]  I'm not going to let this issue drop, Andy Parker told Megyn Kelly of Fox News.
[00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:06.066]  We've got to do something about crazy people getting guns.
[00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:08.487]  And how do they propose to do that?
[00:09:08.627 --> 00:09:12.169]  Well, one way they're going to do it is label everybody crazy using the DSM.
[00:09:12.689 --> 00:09:15.070]  Anybody who doesn't believe what the government says is going to have a problem.
[00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.431]  If you don't believe in vaccinations, you're going to have a problem.
[00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:21.813]  If you were a veteran coming back in a PTSD, you're going to have a problem getting a gun.
[00:09:22.093 --> 00:09:24.194]  That is their idea, is to take everybody
[00:09:24.754 --> 00:09:28.716]  Uh, exclude everybody from the gun list so that nobody is eligible for a gun.
[00:09:28.736 --> 00:09:30.497]  They're just going to slowly tighten the noose.
[00:09:30.677 --> 00:09:34.660]  That is their philosophy and that is what they're going for.
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.522]  That is their strategy, to go after the guns in that way.
[00:09:38.922 --> 00:09:41.283]  Now, if you look at the article from Steve Watson, Race War.
[00:09:41.584 --> 00:09:45.126]  Shooter passed government background check, used legal firearm.
[00:09:45.406 --> 00:09:48.908]  Majority of mass shooters in recent memory passed background checks.
[00:09:49.508 --> 00:10:04.114]  Buzzfeed reports that it has spoken to Thomas Faison, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, who confirmed that Flanagan's Glock 19 pistol was bought weeks ago and that Flanagan had successfully passed all the required background checks.
[00:10:04.694 --> 00:10:07.115]  Faison also noted that Flanagan had purchased a second gun.
[00:10:07.595 --> 00:10:12.157]  The finding again makes void the argument made by those calling for universal background checks.
[00:10:12.839 --> 00:10:20.901]  One such person was Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe, who within three hours of the killings was calling for new gun legislation to assure checks for all gun purchases.
[00:10:21.202 --> 00:10:27.083]  The same argument was made in the Dillon Roof case in June, until it emerged that the weapon Roof used was legally acquired.
[00:10:29.804 --> 00:10:42.248]  In fact, if you look at all the shooters, we had the Virginia Tech shooter, the Aurora Colorado shooter, Fort Hood, Isla Vista, the Washington Navy Yard, even Arapahoe High School, all of these people passed background checks.
[00:10:43.499 --> 00:10:45.981]  So maybe it's not background checks.
[00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:49.343]  Maybe it's something like the types of medication these people are on.
[00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:52.785]  Maybe it's other types of things that we have.
[00:10:53.166 --> 00:11:00.050]  Maybe it's the fact that other people aren't armed like the Navy, not the Navy Yard Shooter, but the ones at the recruiting center that Donald Trump mentioned.
[00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.292]  Those four guys could have fought back.
[00:11:02.532 --> 00:11:05.194]  They are trained to know how to use firearms to defend themselves.
[00:11:05.933 --> 00:11:07.594]  But yet, they aren't allowed to be armed.
[00:11:07.894 --> 00:11:11.697]  That's a President Obama decision that he has kept going from others.
[00:11:11.737 --> 00:11:15.679]  I think Bill Clinton first put that in place at the recruiting centers.
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.621]  And that's something that the Pentagon is standing by.
[00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:19.222]  They're saying, we've got to keep these guys unarmed.
[00:11:20.256 --> 00:11:21.237]  It just doesn't make sense.
[00:11:21.357 --> 00:11:22.318]  It really doesn't make sense.
[00:11:22.618 --> 00:11:30.444]  An armed population is a polite population, as we saw in Ferguson when we had the Oath Keepers walking around with Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson.
[00:11:30.745 --> 00:11:31.766]  Nothing happened that night.
[00:11:32.106 --> 00:11:33.447]  Wow, isn't that amazing?
[00:11:34.168 --> 00:11:35.909]  Moving on, this is from Kit Daniels.
[00:11:36.109 --> 00:11:40.733]  White House pushes race war, then blames guns for Flanagan's race war.
[00:11:41.093 --> 00:11:41.594]  There it is.
[00:11:43.834 --> 00:11:51.910]  The Obama administration is blaming guns for the WBDJ TV shooting, even though the shooter, Vester Hannigan, was influenced by the White House's race baiting.
[00:11:53.021 --> 00:12:03.383]  And this article goes into how back, you know, since Trayvon Martin, this has started with the President and the Attorney General weighing in personally on their own issues.
[00:12:03.843 --> 00:12:07.604]  They're the ones who come in and say, hey, look, Trayvon looked like my son.
[00:12:08.504 --> 00:12:18.925]  Then the Attorney General jumps in, and they always weigh in on these issues when it's politically convenient for them to try to demonize gun ownership in general, because that is what their main mission is, is to go after guns.
[00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:22.106]  And I hope we've proved it going through some of these articles here.
[00:12:22.466 --> 00:12:30.975]  Now, today on the show, Joe Biggs, the Alex Jones Show, Joe Biggs was interviewed by Alex Jones, and we actually put this into an article.
[00:12:31.096 --> 00:12:36.782]  Unlike Confederate flag, liberals won't ban gay flag linked to WDBJ shooting.
[00:12:37.062 --> 00:12:39.485]  Rainbow flag was found in the shooter's apartment.
[00:12:39.845 --> 00:12:41.447]  And here is Joe Biggs with more on that.
[00:12:42.611 --> 00:12:44.212]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:12:44.232 --> 00:12:47.273]  Now I'm standing right across the street from the Beardwater Plaza.
[00:12:47.573 --> 00:12:55.115]  Now over to my left, over here we'll pan across, this is the actual location where Flanagan came in and shot the two journalists.
[00:12:55.195 --> 00:12:58.116]  We still have another person critically injured in the hospital.
[00:12:58.356 --> 00:13:05.659]  Now today at five o'clock our time here on East Coast Standard Time, we're going to have a press conference right over here across the street.
[00:13:05.679 --> 00:13:09.960]  They're going to actually bring us over and let us walk around, talk, ask questions.
[00:13:10.481 --> 00:13:14.042]  And I've got a few questions I'm going to ask, too, as well, so we're prepared for that.
[00:13:14.383 --> 00:13:20.045]  But one of the things that we know today is they found the LGBT flag in Flanagan's apartment.
[00:13:20.445 --> 00:13:27.268]  So what this means is, since he has the flag, that means he represents all gay, lesbian people.
[00:13:27.628 --> 00:13:29.649]  So I think he speaks for them all.
[00:13:29.729 --> 00:13:30.709]  It's a hate flag now.
[00:13:30.989 --> 00:13:35.491]  I think we should call for a full-out ban on that flag, just like they did in Charleston, Alex.
[00:13:35.851 --> 00:13:40.394]  I agree, because the Confederate battle flag, Robert E. Lee flag, was there.
[00:13:40.454 --> 00:13:45.157]  Historically it has nothing to do with oppressing black people, even though they say it does.
[00:13:46.318 --> 00:13:50.680]  Let's ban the rainbow flag now, and let's ban the Confederate flag.
[00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:55.143]  And then if somebody's wearing a Coca-Cola shirt when they kill somebody, I want Coca-Cola banned.
[00:13:55.624 --> 00:13:59.646]  And if somebody runs over somebody in a Ford F-150 on purpose, ban Ford.
[00:14:00.146 --> 00:14:01.527]  Because it is the fault of Ford.
[00:14:01.567 --> 00:14:02.268]  That's a great idea.
[00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:10.282]  And you can read about the hypocrisy in Unlike Confederate Flag, Liberals Won't Ban Gay Flag linked to WDBJ shooting.
[00:14:10.522 --> 00:14:16.893]  And now I want to go to a quick report by David Knight talking about this shooting being Obama's first domestic drone strike.
[00:14:18.237 --> 00:14:21.038]  David Knight for InfoWars.com here with Joe Biggs.
[00:14:21.058 --> 00:14:22.899]  We're in front of the Bridgewater Plaza.
[00:14:22.919 --> 00:14:23.820]  This is a new area.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.420]  Beautiful area here as you pull up.
[00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:27.761]  Wonderful lake, mountains.
[00:14:28.021 --> 00:14:30.342]  They just opened up some new hotel facilities here.
[00:14:30.362 --> 00:14:31.363]  That's what they're reporting on.
[00:14:31.383 --> 00:14:33.384]  It was just kind of a fluff report.
[00:14:33.424 --> 00:14:34.884]  Of course, this is the shooting.
[00:14:34.925 --> 00:14:37.366]  But behind me, you see what the guy was really after.
[00:14:37.926 --> 00:14:39.407]  He really wanted the press coverage.
[00:14:40.107 --> 00:14:42.588]  It was only a couple of weeks ago that he created his Twitter account.
[00:14:43.379 --> 00:14:47.322]  He had an entire media campaign about himself that he had planned.
[00:14:47.342 --> 00:14:50.585]  The guy was a total narcissist, a total racist.
[00:14:51.285 --> 00:14:58.751]  He had bought into the Obama Democrat Party talking points, the way they have used the shooting, especially the one in Charleston.
[00:14:59.557 --> 00:15:00.898]  Creating a race war.
[00:15:00.938 --> 00:15:02.038]  He bought into that totally.
[00:15:02.058 --> 00:15:04.239]  Of course, he's been buying into this for a very long time.
[00:15:04.659 --> 00:15:07.820]  Every time he failed with anything, he used it as an excuse.
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:11.622]  The fact that it was because of racism or the fact that he was gay.
[00:15:12.062 --> 00:15:13.142]  He has a long history.
[00:15:13.502 --> 00:15:17.104]  At least one other station where he couldn't get along with anybody at work.
[00:15:17.124 --> 00:15:18.184]  He had a chip on his shoulder.
[00:15:18.224 --> 00:15:20.605]  He was constantly violent and confrontational with people.
[00:15:21.701 --> 00:15:25.583]  He was written up for incompetence, but of course, it was all about racism.
[00:15:26.324 --> 00:15:30.967]  Now he says in his manifesto, and I think it's interesting that ABC has not released the entire manifesto yet.
[00:15:31.007 --> 00:15:37.851]  They've only given us a couple of quotes that you can see these couple of paragraphs repeated by everybody in the media, but there's 23 pages there.
[00:15:39.403 --> 00:15:57.115]  And what came out of the lawsuit, the depositions that were there, the reasons why they fired him, what we learned from that was that the guy was an adamant Obama supporter, even to the extent that in the last election cycle, he was covering the election with an Obama sticker on his coat.
[00:15:57.155 --> 00:15:58.016]  He was written up for that.
[00:15:58.036 --> 00:15:59.817]  He said, we're not allowed to do that.
[00:15:59.877 --> 00:16:00.958]  We want to try to appear.
[00:16:01.474 --> 00:16:02.435]  At least to be objective.
[00:16:18.248 --> 00:16:19.128]  Who they're lined up with.
[00:16:19.168 --> 00:16:23.530]  I'd like to see John Boehner with his corporate logos on him, just like he was at a NASCAR event.
[00:16:23.971 --> 00:16:26.312]  Nevertheless, he was written up for that partisanship.
[00:16:26.372 --> 00:16:35.736]  He was so heavily into the Obama narrative that once it stepped up, as we saw after the Charleston shooting, that, he said, incentivized him.
[00:16:35.776 --> 00:16:38.157]  He said that happened on the 17th of June.
[00:16:38.257 --> 00:16:40.518]  On the 19th of June, he ordered his gun.
[00:16:41.258 --> 00:16:51.841]  Now, that's important because Terry McAuliffe, who himself is nothing but a Democrat Party operative, this is somebody who, just like Treasury Secretary Lew, has absolutely no clue about what he's doing.
[00:16:51.881 --> 00:16:54.022]  He's merely a Democrat operative.
[00:16:54.062 --> 00:17:00.984]  Terry McAuliffe, who was a Democrat National Committee Chairman, and he was high up in the campaigns of the two Clintons.
[00:17:01.024 --> 00:17:03.865]  Bill Clinton, he was an assistant campaign manager.
[00:17:03.905 --> 00:17:05.885]  He was the campaign manager for Hillary Clinton.
[00:17:06.205 --> 00:17:08.166]  That's his sole qualification for being governor.
[00:17:08.906 --> 00:17:11.910]  But I guess it's a good qualification because it's a constant campaign.
[00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:13.252]  It's about nothing but campaigning.
[00:17:13.512 --> 00:17:14.814]  So what is he campaigning for now?
[00:17:14.874 --> 00:17:16.356]  He's campaigning for more gun control.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:30.843]  In spite of the fact that Vester Flanagan ordered his gun, went through retail channels, would have a background check on him, we have Governor McAuliffe saying that this shows that we need to have universal background checks.
[00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:36.664]  And what he means by that is background checks even for private sales, for gun sales, they want to control everything.
[00:17:36.704 --> 00:17:38.885]  That's just the next incremental step.
[00:17:39.745 --> 00:17:41.546]  That and the race war that we see.
[00:17:41.646 --> 00:17:44.508]  This is the fruition of the race war that everybody is putting into.
[00:17:44.548 --> 00:17:48.910]  He bought into it totally and he became an Obama killing drone.
[00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:50.471]  That's precisely what happened with this.
[00:17:50.771 --> 00:17:51.772]  We're going to have more reports.
[00:17:51.792 --> 00:17:52.612]  I'm here with Joe Biggs.
[00:17:52.632 --> 00:17:56.074]  We're going to be on the radio show today live with Alex Jones with an update.
[00:17:56.455 --> 00:17:56.935]  Stay with us.
[00:17:57.075 --> 00:17:58.035]  Infowars.com.
[00:17:58.096 --> 00:17:58.656]  I'm David Knight.
[00:18:00.384 --> 00:18:00.944]  Well, there you go.
[00:18:00.984 --> 00:18:02.385]  The drone strikes have begun.
[00:18:02.706 --> 00:18:03.346]  Now, stay tuned.
[00:18:03.366 --> 00:18:07.849]  When we come back, we're going to have Joe Biggs live on the scene in Virginia, where the shooting took place yesterday.
[00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.032]  And we're also going to look at some new vaccination news that's coming.
[00:18:11.072 --> 00:18:11.372]  That's right.
[00:18:11.392 --> 00:18:13.073]  They want to push the universal flu shot.
[00:18:13.133 --> 00:18:14.954]  All that and more on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:18:15.014 --> 00:18:16.115]  I'm your host, Rob Dube.
[00:18:16.275 --> 00:18:17.276]  BrainForce is here.
[00:18:17.616 --> 00:18:19.898]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:18:20.178 --> 00:18:25.882]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports.
[00:18:26.383 --> 00:18:28.024]  And it's because of BrainForce.
[00:18:28.692 --> 00:18:33.514]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:18:34.034 --> 00:18:35.895]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:18:36.235 --> 00:18:40.677]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:18:40.837 --> 00:18:42.897]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:44.998]  This is what you're actually designed to run on?
[00:18:45.118 --> 00:18:45.358]  Exactly.
[00:18:45.378 --> 00:18:49.180]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:18:49.704 --> 00:18:57.129]  And that's the principle of InfoWarsLife as far as I understand that you've always had is that it's not about synthetic chemicals and forcing actions.
[00:18:57.329 --> 00:19:05.474]  It's about letting your body do its own thing and giving your body the tools it needs to create these different compounds that are super valuable and super beneficial.
[00:19:05.774 --> 00:19:12.078]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:19:16.189 --> 00:19:19.531]  I wanted to bring Weldon Henson in here briefly, because we have a great sponsor.
[00:19:19.871 --> 00:19:22.573]  Boy, I've sure been enjoying the firearms that I've gotten from them.
[00:19:23.034 --> 00:19:24.775]  HDFirearms.com.
[00:19:25.015 --> 00:19:26.256]  That's Head Down Firearms.
[00:19:26.516 --> 00:19:30.338]  They have super high quality .223s, .308, you name it.
[00:19:30.519 --> 00:19:34.421]  It's called .556, technically, in the .223, that are guns that would be $3,000 or $1,500.
[00:19:34.721 --> 00:19:35.622]  Guns that would be $1,500 or $900.
[00:19:40.265 --> 00:19:48.051]  Well, the important thing to remember is that if you're not in the market to buy a brand new rifle, you have an AR-15, you have an AR-10 platform 308 rifle.
[00:19:48.331 --> 00:19:50.033]  They've got everything you need to upgrade it.
[00:19:50.193 --> 00:19:53.716]  Buy a new part, buy a new trigger, buy a new muzzle brake, buy a new handrail.
[00:19:54.456 --> 00:19:59.080]  It's all an upgrade for your rifle because these are all superior, top-of-the-line quality products made in America.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.801]  Tell folks about their low-profile series.
[00:20:01.921 --> 00:20:03.362]  Well, this is an important thing to have.
[00:20:03.522 --> 00:20:04.902]  This is untraceable.
[00:20:05.362 --> 00:20:07.083]  Anybody can get this kit right here.
[00:20:07.143 --> 00:20:10.384]  You don't have to go through a federal firearms license place.
[00:20:11.185 --> 00:20:12.385]  You can have it shipped right to your house.
[00:20:12.405 --> 00:20:14.086]  This is what the traders have been trying to shut down?
[00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:14.706]  Absolutely.
[00:20:14.826 --> 00:20:20.928]  So you basically have everything you need besides a lower receiver, because that's what's traceable, that's what's serialized, and that's what the federal government's after.
[00:20:22.589 --> 00:20:23.510]  You can get this right here.
[00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.471]  Get your own lower receiver any way you want.
[00:20:25.491 --> 00:20:26.511]  There's different programs.
[00:20:26.531 --> 00:20:31.374]  All you gotta do is your own research and you can find out how to get a lower receiver so that you can put it on this.
[00:20:31.794 --> 00:20:36.417]  Maybe you already have a lower receiver from an AR from way back that you just don't quite use anymore.
[00:20:36.477 --> 00:20:37.438]  It's old, something like that.
[00:20:37.638 --> 00:20:38.338]  You can throw it on this.
[00:20:38.358 --> 00:20:44.522]  You basically have a brand new rifle and you saved money by putting it together yourself and buying this kit right here, which is cheaper than the actual rifle.
[00:20:44.582 --> 00:20:47.764]  And they've got the highest quality barrels, the highest quality triggers.
[00:20:48.204 --> 00:20:49.144]  We're not just saying that.
[00:20:49.185 --> 00:20:50.605]  Go look at the third-party reviews.
[00:20:50.825 --> 00:20:54.087]  Tell them about the new rifle they're producing that's getting amazing reviews.
[00:20:54.467 --> 00:20:55.608]  And then I just got one, this .308.
[00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:58.450]  Yes, that is very... Arcadius.
[00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:59.150]  Arcadius.
[00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.030]  That's very exciting.
[00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:09.275]  They just came out with their own line of AR-10 platforms, which is basically an AR-15, but instead of it being a .556, it shoots a .308 round, which I know you personally like shooting a .308.
[00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:11.116]  I like them both.
[00:21:11.376 --> 00:21:15.058]  I mean, just to be clear, they've always, for years, been making this for the big manufacturers, the high-end.
[00:21:15.298 --> 00:21:16.738]  They're just now not private-labeling.
[00:21:16.758 --> 00:21:17.718]  They're putting out their own guns.
[00:21:17.898 --> 00:21:18.118]  Yes.
[00:21:18.539 --> 00:21:20.359]  Well, the one they sent you, I'm actually jealous of.
[00:21:20.399 --> 00:21:21.239]  It's a beautiful gun.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.841]  It's set up and configured for long-range shooting, marksmanship-type things.
[00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:29.223]  Just the scope alone is something to snuggle with.
[00:21:29.283 --> 00:21:33.846]  Yeah, it's a Vortex 4x16 scope, which you can get at Head Down as well, their distributor.
[00:21:35.007 --> 00:21:39.891]  And things for people to remember is that if you want a 308, you don't have to get the 18-inch barrel.
[00:21:39.911 --> 00:21:41.252]  You don't have to get the 22-inch barrel.
[00:21:41.272 --> 00:21:42.993]  You don't have to get it set up for marksmanship.
[00:21:43.493 --> 00:21:49.077]  You can get one with a 16-inch barrel that's set up for more of an assault weapon type, you know, configuration.
[00:21:49.437 --> 00:21:53.380]  So anything you want, people just call head down, you can get anything you want made there.
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:22:01.065]  And any configuration you might want on your rifle, they're able to do that and they have 100% perfect customer service ratings there.
[00:22:01.693 --> 00:22:03.916]  Bottom line, it's not just firearms.
[00:22:04.216 --> 00:22:08.202]  A ton of accessories, very affordable, and it supports the Info War.
[00:22:08.622 --> 00:22:12.727]  If you're not shopping at HDFirearms.com, you're not helping the Info War.
[00:22:12.807 --> 00:22:13.989]  I mean, this is a win-win.
[00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:15.231]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:22:15.271 --> 00:22:15.891]  Check them out today.
[00:22:15.932 --> 00:22:16.392]  Thank you, Weldon.
[00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.531]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:22:21.611 --> 00:22:22.492]  I'm your host, Rob Dew.
[00:22:22.912 --> 00:22:28.136]  Coming up, we're going to look at some new vaccine news and some immigration news that's happening in Europe, but also pertains to here.
[00:22:28.236 --> 00:22:38.223]  And joining us now from Minetta, Virginia, the site of yesterday's news shooting killings that took place where two people were shot by a disgruntled employee, is Joe Biggs joining us via Skype.
[00:22:38.303 --> 00:22:41.505]  Joe, I understand you guys just finished a press conference.
[00:22:41.545 --> 00:22:42.105]  How did that go?
[00:22:42.125 --> 00:22:47.349]  Well, it was a press conference with the owner of this facility at the Bridgewater Plaza.
[00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:54.253]  Coming out and saying that, you know, due to the shooting, they're not going to open businesses for another 24 hours out of respect for what's going on.
[00:22:54.553 --> 00:22:56.274]  And I'm going to walk around real quick over here to the front.
[00:22:56.294 --> 00:23:00.396]  You can see the memorial that they have set up for the victims.
[00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:11.481]  Now, this is what's set up out front right now at this moment in time.
[00:23:11.501 --> 00:23:13.182]  I don't know how good you guys can see this, but
[00:23:15.154 --> 00:23:15.694]  No, we can see it.
[00:23:15.714 --> 00:23:16.375]  There's flowers.
[00:23:16.415 --> 00:23:18.956]  It looks like you're also showing us some footage.
[00:23:19.096 --> 00:23:24.498]  It looks like they've replaced floorboards there in the in the area immediately around you.
[00:23:24.518 --> 00:23:25.459]  Describe what that looks like.
[00:23:25.479 --> 00:23:26.299]  All right.
[00:23:26.399 --> 00:23:31.882]  So this is the area, the path of the killer that Flanagan took now.
[00:23:32.382 --> 00:23:34.743]  Right down this area right here is where they were reporting.
[00:23:34.883 --> 00:23:36.204]  He walked down here casually.
[00:23:37.304 --> 00:23:43.407]  And just like I heard in the news conference earlier at the actual news station,
[00:23:44.138 --> 00:23:47.579]  You know, when you're doing a live feed, you focus on doing the story.
[00:23:47.619 --> 00:23:53.741]  You don't really pay attention to people around you because you're always going to get sightseers, people who want to stop in and see what's going on whenever they see someone reporting on the news.
[00:23:54.482 --> 00:23:59.984]  So they think that's why there was really no alarm and why no one really broke what was going on.
[00:24:00.024 --> 00:24:03.205]  They didn't look away until the cameraman panned over.
[00:24:03.445 --> 00:24:07.086]  And then that's when Mr. Flanagan, he walked up this way, as you can see.
[00:24:07.106 --> 00:24:12.608]  And this is the area where the cameraman was standing right here.
[00:24:13.831 --> 00:24:16.192]  He had his back to the killer.
[00:24:16.372 --> 00:24:18.913]  And this is where you see the chest cam go up.
[00:24:19.373 --> 00:24:21.734]  And this is where Allison Parker was standing interviewing.
[00:24:22.435 --> 00:24:24.176]  And this is where you see the shooting happen.
[00:24:24.536 --> 00:24:26.657]  The camera drops down like so.
[00:24:28.377 --> 00:24:29.958]  And everyone was wondering what was going on.
[00:24:30.058 --> 00:24:35.320]  Well, this is the area where she took from as she was shot.
[00:24:36.601 --> 00:24:38.382]  And then panned across and came through here.
[00:24:38.402 --> 00:24:41.643]  And now you can see here where they replaced the boards as well.
[00:24:41.683 --> 00:24:43.344]  This is where she stopped and laid to rest.
[00:24:43.905 --> 00:24:50.947]  On the other, on the underside, on the second floor, the first floor I should say, you can see how they replaced more boards where the blood had dripped through.
[00:24:51.368 --> 00:24:53.648]  But they've replaced all this where she laid to rest.
[00:24:54.129 --> 00:25:04.012]  And like you said, this is a tragic accident that happened, or a tragic incident that happened by a deranged, racist man who decided to go on a spree.
[00:25:05.137 --> 00:25:09.318]  Yeah, and you know, people were saying, well, she ran after she was shot.
[00:25:09.398 --> 00:25:13.159]  That's the it's flight or fight is what it's called.
[00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:17.000]  The mechanism where your brain triggers and you're either going to run for your life.
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.700]  Are you going to fight for your life?
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:20.721]  Well, yeah, she didn't make it that far.
[00:25:20.741 --> 00:25:21.501]  It looks like so.
[00:25:21.781 --> 00:25:25.102]  Eventually, whatever whatever she was shot with, they said was a Glock 19.
[00:25:26.482 --> 00:25:29.083]  It took her down not too far from forever.
[00:25:29.123 --> 00:25:30.023]  She was initially shot.
[00:25:30.523 --> 00:25:31.463]  Yeah, so this is the board.
[00:25:31.503 --> 00:25:34.684]  This is right where she was standing and then right there.
[00:25:36.327 --> 00:25:37.368]  Yeah.
[00:25:38.008 --> 00:25:43.992]  And there's one more victim that's still in the hospital, is that correct?
[00:25:44.492 --> 00:25:48.014]  Yeah, that was one of the people who work for the Chamber of Commerce, the lady.
[00:25:48.034 --> 00:25:50.796]  She's in critical or stable condition at this point in time.
[00:25:51.116 --> 00:25:51.957]  That's all I've heard of.
[00:25:52.337 --> 00:25:58.681]  But you know, you have everybody across the country, you know, from Piers Morgan over in the UK tooting his gun control horn.
[00:25:58.701 --> 00:26:03.243]  I've actually been in tweet battles with him all day where he's calling for more gun control.
[00:26:04.548 --> 00:26:07.070]  Americans need to be tired of senseless gun violence.
[00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:09.792]  I told him he needs to be done with his senseless reporting.
[00:26:10.232 --> 00:26:11.333]  You know, this guy's a joke.
[00:26:11.373 --> 00:26:12.854]  He keeps barking into our affairs.
[00:26:13.515 --> 00:26:15.436]  You know, I think he has Second Amendment envy.
[00:26:16.037 --> 00:26:22.541]  But this guy is completely out of control, just like much of the mainstream media who are running around and all of a sudden wanting to blame a gun.
[00:26:22.922 --> 00:26:29.346]  Now, if I were to lay a gun down here on this table over here to my left and leave it here, people would walk by it all day.
[00:26:29.367 --> 00:26:31.708]  Not one person would be shot by it.
[00:26:31.748 --> 00:26:33.970]  Not one person would be attacked by that gun.
[00:26:34.261 --> 00:26:36.583]  It's not going to get up, grow legs, and start pulling the trigger.
[00:26:36.864 --> 00:26:38.605]  It takes a deranged person to pick it up.
[00:26:38.966 --> 00:26:40.867]  Now, back in biblical times, they didn't have guns.
[00:26:41.208 --> 00:26:42.129]  They still killed people.
[00:26:42.189 --> 00:26:45.072]  They used rocks, they used arrows, they used anything they could get their hands on.
[00:26:45.412 --> 00:26:49.536]  If you have evil in your heart, and you intend on doing harm, you'll figure out a way to do it.
[00:26:49.876 --> 00:26:52.419]  So, banning guns, gun control is not the answer.
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:27:02.803]  Yeah, and we covered an article earlier that Kit Daniels just put up, and it was something you said, talking to Alex today, about how they found an LGBT flag in his apartment.
[00:27:03.263 --> 00:27:10.105]  Therefore, we can just go ahead and paint everybody with a broad brush, just like they're doing with anybody who owns a Confederate flag.
[00:27:10.425 --> 00:27:11.365]  So, talk about that a little bit.
[00:27:12.085 --> 00:27:12.686]  Well, exactly.
[00:27:12.706 --> 00:27:18.747]  You know, they found this racist flag that promotes killing, and like I said, I think they should ban it on all levels.
[00:27:18.787 --> 00:27:20.028]  We should not have to see that again.
[00:27:20.068 --> 00:27:21.168]  It should be taken down everywhere.
[00:27:21.921 --> 00:27:32.289]  Uh, these bakeries that have been forced to make cakes that go with that, they should not have to be forced to make these cakes anymore because it promotes violence, it promotes racism, and it promotes the murder of people.
[00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:37.933]  I mean, plain and simply, I mean, if that's how they're going to project it with another flag, let's do the same thing.
[00:27:37.973 --> 00:27:43.978]  Let's take a guy who is an African American who is a homosexual, and let's just paint everyone to be exactly like he is from here on out.
[00:27:44.321 --> 00:27:45.642]  And Joe, it's like what you just said.
[00:27:46.022 --> 00:28:00.128]  When you paint everybody with one broad brush, good things can't happen, which is why, you know, I understand you're making the point facetiously that, hey, because he had this LGBT flag, we've got to go ahead and ban the flags, anything to do with this.
[00:28:00.408 --> 00:28:01.809]  That's not the point here.
[00:28:01.849 --> 00:28:12.574]  The point is, when they did it to people who were holding Confederate flags, people who were just celebrating their Southern heritage, they were called racist, they were called violent, and there was this purge of
[00:28:13.254 --> 00:28:14.795]  Southern culture and southern history.
[00:28:15.575 --> 00:28:16.856]  And it's wrong to do that.
[00:28:16.896 --> 00:28:18.197]  It's wrong to do that on both angles.
[00:28:18.857 --> 00:28:19.417]  Don't you agree?
[00:28:20.098 --> 00:28:20.758]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:20.798 --> 00:28:24.840]  I mean, you don't see any of us sitting there blaming it on black people as a whole.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.882]  You don't see us blaming it on gay people as a whole.
[00:28:27.962 --> 00:28:35.726]  Like I said, that's purely just a point to make that when something happens, you can't, like you said, paint that broad stroke and say that everyone's that way.
[00:28:35.806 --> 00:28:36.566]  I'm my own person.
[00:28:36.806 --> 00:28:37.807]  I make my own decisions.
[00:28:38.107 --> 00:28:40.028]  I put my own pants on in the morning and I decide
[00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:42.211]  Whether or not I'm gonna do the right thing every day.
[00:28:42.251 --> 00:28:44.773]  That's my choice as a human being to do the right thing.
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.162]  Some kind of wrong that was done to him.
[00:29:12.743 --> 00:29:16.367]  But then again, I'm not going to blame the entire African American community.
[00:29:16.407 --> 00:29:18.830]  I'm not going to blame the entire LGBT community.
[00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:25.798]  I'm going to blame the individual who made that individual choice to make that bad decision to come out and do something like this.
[00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:28.072]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[00:29:28.112 --> 00:29:33.840]  I just hope that people understand that, you know, when a crazy white person does something, it's a crazy white person.
[00:29:33.901 --> 00:29:36.444]  When it's a crazy black person, it's a crazy black person.
[00:29:36.865 --> 00:29:38.167]  And it's not everybody's fault.
[00:29:38.247 --> 00:29:39.449]  It's not every gun owner's fault.
[00:29:39.929 --> 00:29:42.693]  And just to show that these background checks don't really work,
[00:29:43.334 --> 00:29:47.095]  Almost every mass shooting that has happened, all these guys passed a background check.
[00:29:47.455 --> 00:29:51.495]  So either they're not running the system right, or the system just doesn't work.
[00:29:51.575 --> 00:29:57.556]  I mean, either way, you still have people being able to get guns, and if they made guns illegal, people would still be getting guns.
[00:29:57.676 --> 00:29:58.877]  Criminals would still be getting guns.
[00:29:58.957 --> 00:30:00.077]  Criminals would still be shooting people.
[00:30:00.157 --> 00:30:01.137]  They don't care about the law.
[00:30:01.397 --> 00:30:03.037]  There's a law that says you don't rob banks.
[00:30:03.357 --> 00:30:04.338]  People still rob banks.
[00:30:05.078 --> 00:30:07.418]  I mean, there's laws against drugs, and people still do it every day.
[00:30:07.478 --> 00:30:08.718]  People are still dying from heroin.
[00:30:08.958 --> 00:30:12.139]  People still die from cocaine overdoses, and these drugs are outlawed.
[00:30:12.759 --> 00:30:13.459]  So it doesn't work.
[00:30:13.519 --> 00:30:14.960]  You can outlaw things every day.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:20.101]  What it comes down to are individual responsibilities and making the right choice or not.
[00:30:20.581 --> 00:30:21.361]  And that's what happened.
[00:30:21.681 --> 00:30:22.481]  Yeah.
[00:30:22.521 --> 00:30:24.502]  What has the press's response been to all this?
[00:30:24.542 --> 00:30:26.282]  How are they trying to spin this?
[00:30:26.722 --> 00:30:29.063]  Are they working on trying to make this an anti-gun story?
[00:30:29.923 --> 00:30:30.463]  Oh, of course.
[00:30:30.503 --> 00:30:31.323]  I mean, that's all you can see.
[00:30:31.443 --> 00:30:35.204]  Get on Twitter, get on Facebook, and look at all the comments and stuff and all the posts from people.
[00:30:35.665 --> 00:30:37.525]  Ban the guns, ban the guns, ban the guns.
[00:30:37.545 --> 00:30:39.545]  Just blame a tool or something like that.
[00:30:39.565 --> 00:30:41.766]  But like I said, if you lay a gun down on this rail right here,
[00:30:42.199 --> 00:30:45.366]  It takes a person picking it up, pulling the trigger to make it go off.
[00:30:45.406 --> 00:30:48.913]  It'd be like me blaming forks for obesity across the world.
[00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:51.671]  Some people would like to blame Forks.
[00:30:51.691 --> 00:30:53.832]  There's always somebody looking to blame something.
[00:30:54.413 --> 00:31:05.319]  One thing we never really look at in these shootings, and we don't know if this guy was on any type of medication, but psychotropic drugs, which seem to be the common denominator with most of these guys in their shootings.
[00:31:05.559 --> 00:31:12.724]  They were on some sort of drug that either kicked them over the edge, or they were coming off of it and it kicked them over the edge, or they were on it and completely out of their gourd.
[00:31:13.304 --> 00:31:16.546]  And we never ever see the mainstream media look at those issues.
[00:31:16.886 --> 00:31:18.787]  Joe, I know you're going to be filing more reports.
[00:31:18.807 --> 00:31:20.668]  I appreciate you going out there, you and David Knight.
[00:31:21.008 --> 00:31:23.129]  Be safe, and let us know if anything else breaks.
[00:31:23.829 --> 00:31:27.631]  Well, coming up, we're going to look at the new universal flu jab and what it means to you.
[00:31:27.911 --> 00:31:38.256]  And also, in the studio, joining me will be Jakari Jackson, talking about the new documentary about the Silk Road founder, Ross Ulbricht, and what happens when you cut in on the government's drug-running business.
[00:31:38.656 --> 00:31:39.657]  All that and more, stay tuned.
[00:31:39.677 --> 00:31:42.318]  It's the InfoWars Nightly News, and I'm your host, Rob Doo.
[00:31:43.458 --> 00:31:47.599]  You traitors claiming I'm a Ruski agent, say it to my face and I'll break your nose.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.480]  I'm sick of it.
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.761]  I will stomp your head in the ground, you traitorous maggots.
[00:31:51.981 --> 00:32:05.185]  While we go under Obamacare, North American Union, conquered by European banks, announcing our kids don't belong to us, total bondage, total surveillance, and you want to shoot your mouth off about me being a Ruski agent, I will stomp your head in the ground.
[00:32:05.425 --> 00:32:11.169]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 proof.
[00:32:11.609 --> 00:32:15.511]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:32:17.012 --> 00:32:22.856]  I wish we'd go back to the days, I'm telling you, of getting my satisfaction out in the street.
[00:32:23.696 --> 00:32:26.398]  You pick a sword or something else, drink on out in the street.
[00:32:27.327 --> 00:32:28.547]  Another major health threat.
[00:32:28.587 --> 00:32:33.469]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:32:33.549 --> 00:32:36.190]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:42.992]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:32:43.272 --> 00:32:46.133]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:32:46.273 --> 00:32:49.194]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:32:49.214 --> 00:32:51.214]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:32:51.234 --> 00:32:54.075]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:32:54.155 --> 00:32:59.678]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:32:59.878 --> 00:33:03.379]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:33:03.399 --> 00:33:06.401]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:33:06.501 --> 00:33:13.604]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:33:13.805 --> 00:33:16.706]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[00:33:17.186 --> 00:33:23.330]  Hi, I'm Shane Steiner.
[00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:31.536]  A lot of you have been following my progress using Supermail Vitality.
[00:33:31.756 --> 00:33:34.437]  The last 19 weeks has been an incredible experience.
[00:33:34.818 --> 00:33:39.881]  I was feeling a little down and lethargic during the holidays, and none of the supplements that I was taking were doing any good.
[00:33:40.041 --> 00:33:44.644]  That's when my longtime friend from high school, Alex Jones, introduced me to Supermail Vitality.
[00:33:44.904 --> 00:33:46.105]  I was a little skeptical at first.
[00:33:46.465 --> 00:33:55.153]  Not only would I have the energy to work out and go to the gym, but it was actually the changes were happening to my body a lot more rapidly.
[00:33:55.293 --> 00:33:59.257]  My whole mood, my libido, everything had completely changed.
[00:33:59.698 --> 00:34:06.304]  The concentrated organic herbs, they stimulate your natural systems to produce the natural hormones that you need.
[00:34:06.664 --> 00:34:18.028]  I just really wanted to bulk up and hit it hard and I went in for about the first five weeks and was lifting heavy weight and just really hitting it hard and I gained 20 pounds of muscle immediately.
[00:34:18.188 --> 00:34:20.889]  Since that, I've decided I was going to lose some weight and slim down.
[00:34:20.969 --> 00:34:24.030]  I just changed up my workout a little bit and 35 pounds came off.
[00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:25.390]  Folks, this is not a joke.
[00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:26.351]  This is not a gimmick.
[00:34:26.451 --> 00:34:26.951]  It's real.
[00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:28.131]  Super Male Vitality.
[00:34:28.411 --> 00:34:29.932]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:34:34.306 --> 00:34:39.311]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:34:39.551 --> 00:34:45.676]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:34:45.857 --> 00:34:52.843]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:34:53.163 --> 00:35:03.107]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:35:03.687 --> 00:35:09.610]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:13.011]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and
[00:35:13.311 --> 00:35:14.412]  Adenosylcobalamin.
[00:35:14.672 --> 00:35:18.013]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:35:18.274 --> 00:35:19.874]  No needles, no injections.
[00:35:20.155 --> 00:35:21.615]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:35:21.635 --> 00:35:22.836]  Try it for yourself.

[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.101]  Our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:35:36.923 --> 00:35:39.064]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:35:39.284 --> 00:35:44.485]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:35:44.645 --> 00:35:49.747]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:35:49.887 --> 00:35:52.988]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:35:53.288 --> 00:35:57.169]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew link to numerous conditions.
[00:35:57.409 --> 00:36:01.712]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:36:01.792 --> 00:36:11.939]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:36:12.159 --> 00:36:23.087]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:36:23.227 --> 00:36:25.689]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:30.609 --> 00:36:32.369]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:41.392]  Now, coming up, we're going to look at the stories that you're being distracted from with this TV news shooting, and also some very important vaccine news that is coming down the pike.
[00:36:41.632 --> 00:36:46.353]  But first, I want to analyze and critique some clips from the spinoff series to The Walking Dead.
[00:36:46.393 --> 00:36:51.234]  It's called Fear the Walking Dead, and it premiered on Sunday, this past Sunday.
[00:36:51.314 --> 00:36:56.035]  It was one of the largest cable ratings ever, 10.1 million viewers there.
[00:36:56.055 --> 00:36:57.636]  You can see that on the BBC News.
[00:36:59.096 --> 00:37:01.678]  When I read that, I was like, well, I gotta watch it.
[00:37:01.738 --> 00:37:07.521]  Not because I wanted to jump on the bandwagon, because I wanted to see what type of propaganda they were going to slip into this.
[00:37:07.861 --> 00:37:13.044]  Because TV shows like this that get real popular, they always like to slip in social conditioning.
[00:37:13.364 --> 00:37:16.126]  Now, this first clip, it's gonna speak for itself, so I'm gonna let it roll.
[00:37:20.468 --> 00:37:22.370]  Yeah, you know, I don't think any of this is gonna happen before lunch.
[00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:23.850]  Talk to me around 2.30.
[00:37:24.731 --> 00:37:25.331]  Morning, Maddie.
[00:37:25.912 --> 00:37:26.272]  Marty.
[00:37:26.292 --> 00:37:26.872]  Thanks.
[00:37:26.892 --> 00:37:27.432]  Five bucks, okay?
[00:37:27.513 --> 00:37:27.953]  Here you go.
[00:37:29.329 --> 00:37:30.350]  A lot of kids out sick today.
[00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:31.631]  I thought you were another victim.
[00:37:32.311 --> 00:37:33.673]  No, I got my flu shot.
[00:37:34.633 --> 00:37:35.094]  You alright?
[00:37:35.114 --> 00:37:40.698]  I'm good.
[00:37:40.718 --> 00:37:41.339]  Hold on there, son.
[00:37:41.719 --> 00:37:42.380]  I'm okay, I'm okay.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.160]  Now I'm glad to hear it.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.201]  Empty your pockets.
[00:37:44.581 --> 00:37:45.962]  Stop running, Tobias.
[00:37:46.383 --> 00:37:47.504]  Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.
[00:37:47.764 --> 00:37:48.504]  Empty your pockets, son.
[00:37:49.685 --> 00:37:50.606]  Listen up, Tobias.
[00:37:50.666 --> 00:37:51.867]  Do what Mr. Costa says.
[00:37:52.888 --> 00:37:53.809]  Check your pockets.
[00:37:56.806 --> 00:37:58.107]  Wow, nothing weird about that.
[00:37:58.167 --> 00:38:00.029]  You got officials just digging in your pockets.
[00:38:00.429 --> 00:38:01.910]  Violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:38:02.311 --> 00:38:04.172]  You've got the school set up like a prison.
[00:38:04.813 --> 00:38:07.255]  You've got flu shot propaganda being inserted.
[00:38:07.475 --> 00:38:11.719]  All that, all in the span of just two short little clips that we put together.
[00:38:12.439 --> 00:38:30.934]  Now, carrying on this conversation here, the counselor and the student then go in to talk about what's going on, and he's reading stuff on the internet that's really bad, sort of like stuff we might put out, you know, about a virus or this and that, stuff that the mainstream media is not going to report on, and she tells him, you stop looking at that internet.
[00:38:30.974 --> 00:38:32.255]  Here's that clip.
[00:38:35.255 --> 00:38:37.396]  They say that, but I don't believe them.
[00:38:38.597 --> 00:38:38.797]  It is.
[00:38:39.337 --> 00:38:43.680]  Reports in five states, they don't know if it's a virus or a microbe.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:46.321]  They don't know, but it's spreading.
[00:38:46.381 --> 00:38:47.302]  People are killing!
[00:38:47.582 --> 00:38:50.044]  You need to spend less time online, okay?
[00:38:50.764 --> 00:38:52.745]  If there's a problem, we're gonna know about it.
[00:38:54.286 --> 00:38:55.647]  The authorities would tell us.
[00:38:56.886 --> 00:38:57.727]  That's right, man.
[00:38:58.327 --> 00:38:59.268]  Just chill out.
[00:38:59.308 --> 00:39:00.809]  The authorities are going to tell you everything.
[00:39:01.189 --> 00:39:03.170]  Right now they're running around saying the economy's fine.
[00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:03.731]  Don't worry.
[00:39:03.931 --> 00:39:04.831]  Don't worry about anything.
[00:39:05.272 --> 00:39:05.792]  Oh, oh.
[00:39:06.413 --> 00:39:09.575]  And then I like his response here, which I thought was pretty telling.
[00:39:10.115 --> 00:39:12.677]  And it's sort of like, yeah, I'm going to give in to you, but not really.
[00:39:13.317 --> 00:39:14.598]  I'm going to go on and prep.
[00:39:14.998 --> 00:39:15.519]  So here it is.
[00:39:21.163 --> 00:39:21.443]  Yeah.
[00:39:22.984 --> 00:39:23.244]  Sure.
[00:39:25.245 --> 00:39:25.886]  You're right, Missy.
[00:39:29.175 --> 00:39:30.056]  Can I go now, please?
[00:39:31.337 --> 00:39:32.237]  Yeah.
[00:39:32.297 --> 00:39:35.019]  Great acting job from the pimple-faced nerd.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.803]  You know, he goes online, he finds his own information, but it's not what the authorities are telling him.
[00:39:40.223 --> 00:39:46.788]  And here's one final bit of flu shot mind control that they like to insert in these pieces.
[00:39:46.828 --> 00:39:47.189]  Here it is.
[00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.530]  Five?
[00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:51.472]  Did you miss a few stops?
[00:39:54.489 --> 00:39:55.790]  I hope you guys got your flu shots.
[00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:56.851]  That's right.
[00:39:56.911 --> 00:39:58.012]  We always get our flu shots.
[00:39:58.252 --> 00:40:00.053]  Every day, we always get our flu shots.
[00:40:00.713 --> 00:40:01.214]  That's right.
[00:40:01.294 --> 00:40:05.497]  So that was just some interesting propaganda that was thrown into Fear the Walking Dead.
[00:40:05.537 --> 00:40:11.521]  Of course, they don't really tell you how the people become zombies or whatever, and I guess maybe we'll find that out.
[00:40:11.561 --> 00:40:12.141]  Maybe we won't.
[00:40:12.461 --> 00:40:13.642]  But let's get into some real news.
[00:40:13.682 --> 00:40:18.746]  I just wanted to share that with you just to show you different ways propaganda is inserted into these TV shows.
[00:40:19.646 --> 00:40:22.408]  We've shown you plenty of other instances throughout the years.
[00:40:22.448 --> 00:40:23.289]  That's just the latest.
[00:40:23.749 --> 00:40:27.910]  And this is out of the American Free Press and it has to do with mandatory HPV vaccines.
[00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:31.671]  Uprising against HPV vaccine mandate sweeps Rhode Island.
[00:40:31.892 --> 00:40:34.032]  You may remember this from a couple weeks ago.
[00:40:34.072 --> 00:40:39.454]  We had a Dan Badondi report where he actually went and interviewed some of the parents who don't want this to come down.
[00:40:39.494 --> 00:40:40.994]  They were fighting with the Department of Health.
[00:40:41.034 --> 00:40:42.775]  They were like, we're not going to vaccinate our kids.
[00:40:43.095 --> 00:40:46.836]  One guy even talked about how his kid became blind after receiving the vaccine.
[00:40:47.476 --> 00:40:49.757]  Rhode Island health bureaucrats are facing an uprising
[00:40:50.057 --> 00:40:50.437]  I'm good to go.
[00:41:08.035 --> 00:41:19.658]  Now, leading the charge is a grassroots group called Rhode Islanders Against Mandatory HPV, and their co-leader, Amy Gardner, co-leader of the organization, said the goal is to protect parental and civil rights.
[00:41:19.998 --> 00:41:27.160]  Mandating a vaccine that is attached to school attendance, that is not a public health threat or transferable in the classroom is not okay, she said.
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:31.861]  It's bad public policy and it's bad use of power from the Rhode Island Department of Health.
[00:41:32.581 --> 00:41:44.738]  And what is really interesting, when you go back to where they were having that meeting, Dan showed the picture of the head of the Rhode Island Department of Health, and he's got a giant syringe and he's chasing a pilgrim to try and give him an injection in the buttocks.
[00:41:45.532 --> 00:41:46.713]  Very disgusting.
[00:41:47.033 --> 00:41:52.315]  Now, in other health news dealing with vaccines, this is out of Yahoo just a few days ago.
[00:41:52.475 --> 00:41:55.197]  Major step towards universal flu vaccine.
[00:41:55.597 --> 00:41:57.558]  And this is being studied right now.
[00:41:58.318 --> 00:42:02.580]  And what they want to do is create a vaccine that will get all forms of flu.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:06.202]  And the way they're going to do that is to attach it to a specific protein.
[00:42:06.522 --> 00:42:10.564]  It's a nano-sized protein called ferritin, which they're going to
[00:42:11.364 --> 00:42:20.228]  Use gene technology, who knows, but they're going to implement this into the vaccine and it's supposed to help you against all forms of the flu virus.
[00:42:20.828 --> 00:42:25.430]  No way I'm taking that vaccine with the aluminum and thimerosal and all the other stuff they want to put into it.
[00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:34.254]  And now for all the other issues that you might have missed while you're being glued to the TV with this TV news shooting, it's Jon Bowen with a report on all the distractions.
[00:42:35.649 --> 00:42:41.455]  The economy began its rollercoaster ride on Monday, nosediving a historic 1,000 points.
[00:42:41.796 --> 00:42:46.961]  Some called for preparation, while weaponized media told us there was nothing to worry about.
[00:42:47.201 --> 00:42:53.909]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton slowly careens off the campaign highway, staring an FBI investigation in the face.
[00:42:54.269 --> 00:43:12.389]  While Donald Trump is leaving poll bureaus flabbergasted with the numbers resulting from his frank, populist talk, Planned Parenthood is unmasked for the baby factory that it is, and the Pentagon quietly begins investigating whistleblower reports that CENTCOM is allegedly hiding the expansion of ISIS.
[00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:14.652]  And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:43:14.972 --> 00:43:20.317]  For roughly 48 hours, the narrative is clearly a raw nerve exposing itself to the masses.
[00:43:20.657 --> 00:43:26.823]  A diversion was sorely needed in order to push all of those skeletons back into the jammed closet.
[00:43:27.304 --> 00:43:34.691]  Wednesday morning, the world woke up to the sick, premeditated, cold-blooded, on-air murder of a journalist and her cameraman.
[00:43:35.151 --> 00:43:35.632]  We're good to go.
[00:43:58.354 --> 00:43:59.235]  This is the main issue.
[00:43:59.255 --> 00:44:05.218]  The media is going to turn this into an absolute spectacle and a call to restrict the Second Amendment, whether it's CNN, whether it's MSNBC, or even Fox News.
[00:44:23.427 --> 00:44:37.150]  That is what is now being pushed, right as Obama promises a bunch of executive action to restrict the Second Amendment, even of Social Security recipients, using VA algorithms applied by the FBI.
[00:44:37.991 --> 00:44:50.674]  So a massive anti-gun move is being launched, and you've got this individual who looks like he's in a first-person shoot-'em-up video game like Doom or Call of Duty.
[00:44:51.784 --> 00:45:02.991]  Up front, with the gun in his hand, with his phone, recording the video of when he shoots the poor reporter and the cameraman.
[00:45:03.291 --> 00:45:05.132]  This is unprecedented.
[00:45:05.472 --> 00:45:11.496]  Now, there's tons of video of ISIS, funded by our government and others, openly killing hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:45:12.276 --> 00:45:15.978]  There's all sorts of footage of Saudi Arabia chopping people's heads off.
[00:45:16.358 --> 00:45:23.841]  You don't see that getting played because they don't want to get you upset about our ally ISIS and our ally Saudi Arabia.
[00:45:24.878 --> 00:45:37.449]  The only person in the arena even mentioning the epidemic of SSRI drugs and the possibility of this incident being once again directly related to the pharmaceutical giants was, of course, Donald Trump and Infowars.
[00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:42.354]  As usual, the illegal invasion of Syria, Europe, and our own borders are underway.
[00:45:42.714 --> 00:45:53.044]  Foreign military is stationed all over the United States, while PSYOP operations, similar to Jade Helm, quietly test the infiltration and data collection of American communities.
[00:45:53.284 --> 00:46:03.014]  Billionaires, replete with inside information, are fleeing the sinking ship for greener pastures, identical to the in-the-know absences during the 9-11 spectacle.
[00:46:03.454 --> 00:46:05.917]  Something wicked this way comes.
[00:46:06.417 --> 00:46:11.882]  The ominous, occultic date of September 23rd is just weeks away.
[00:46:12.202 --> 00:46:13.203]  Are you prepared?
[00:46:13.523 --> 00:46:24.612]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com Fool me once, shame on you.
[00:46:25.473 --> 00:46:27.955]  Fool me twice, shame on me.
[00:46:29.135 --> 00:46:29.916]  Vote for Jeb?
[00:46:29.936 --> 00:46:32.118]  Boy, you're just f***ing stupid.
[00:46:36.274 --> 00:46:37.515]  We can't get fooled again.
[00:46:37.875 --> 00:46:43.679]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:46:44.139 --> 00:46:53.825]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:46:54.165 --> 00:46:57.928]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:46:58.468 --> 00:47:03.151]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:47:03.532 --> 00:47:09.756]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:47:10.076 --> 00:47:12.358]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:47:38.576 --> 00:47:40.218]  The knowledge of the ancients.
[00:47:40.558 --> 00:47:44.101]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:47:44.361 --> 00:47:46.963]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:47:47.304 --> 00:47:50.707]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:47:50.927 --> 00:47:55.611]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge
[00:47:55.751 --> 00:47:56.532]  We're good to go!
[00:48:23.993 --> 00:48:24.774]  We're good to go.
[00:48:46.072 --> 00:48:48.633]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News, I'm your host Rob Dew.
[00:48:48.913 --> 00:48:58.498]  Joining me in the studio now is Jakari Jackson, who last night went to see a showing, sort of a fundraiser for Ross Ulbricht, and this is on the documentary Deep Web, which was directed by Alex Winter.
[00:48:58.558 --> 00:49:01.059]  You may remember him from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.
[00:49:01.779 --> 00:49:04.060]  Jakari, what are your thoughts on the film?
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:05.401]  It was a really good film.
[00:49:05.821 --> 00:49:09.123]  I knew of Silk Road, but I didn't know too much about it.
[00:49:09.463 --> 00:49:11.624]  So for me, it was very much a learning experience.
[00:49:11.644 --> 00:49:12.605]  There are other people there.
[00:49:12.785 --> 00:49:15.286]  Julia, who joined us yesterday on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:49:15.346 --> 00:49:18.188]  Also, local Austin activists as well.
[00:49:18.268 --> 00:49:19.288]  Kit Daniels was out there.
[00:49:19.769 --> 00:49:21.449]  Mikhail Thelin.
[00:49:21.469 --> 00:49:28.033]  And basically, for the people who aren't familiar with the story, Ross Ulbricht was a guy who, you know, somewhat
[00:49:28.533 --> 00:49:38.736]  Unique to me, you know, they document how he was an engineer, he went to school for all these things, but eventually when it comes to his trial, he admits that he is the creator and operator of the Silk Road.
[00:49:39.056 --> 00:49:49.879]  Now a lot of people will talk about the Silk Road and how illegal drugs and other illicit activities happen on there, now that you can go out to some street corner and sell your drugs anyway, but the feds want to come down on him, Chuckie Schumer,
[00:49:50.339 --> 00:49:51.800]  Yeah, and that's what Alex Winter pointed out.
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:57.982]  He was like, I really think one of the reasons that they came down on him so hard is because they gave him a platform to do it outside of government jurisdiction.
[00:49:58.022 --> 00:50:01.263]  They were using bitcoins or some other type of currency that wasn't so easy to trace.
[00:50:01.303 --> 00:50:03.364]  Also, the government wasn't getting any cut off of it.
[00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:25.654]  So of course they had to come in and kick in the guy's door and make a whole big show out of it to scare anybody from doing anything like this in the near future.
[00:50:25.955 --> 00:50:34.160]  And something interesting about this that I didn't know, after they took down Silk Road, there were many other similar or copycat sites that sprung up to take its place.
[00:50:35.021 --> 00:50:48.070]  And one of the points they make in the film, even if it is used for illicit activity, they made the point that while you have drug dealers and gangbangers killing each other out in the streets, if you're exchanging your stuff over bitcoins and through the mail, nobody's getting shot, nobody's getting hurt.
[00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:51.511]  You know, so it's a very good point as to that.
[00:50:51.571 --> 00:50:52.111]  Well, that too.
[00:50:52.291 --> 00:50:57.814]  And just because somebody is using a website for illegal purposes, you can't ban the website or ban the person.
[00:50:57.834 --> 00:50:58.754]  It's the same thing with guns.
[00:50:59.074 --> 00:51:00.675]  Somebody's going to use a gun to do something illegal.
[00:51:00.955 --> 00:51:03.776]  Well, you can't take that right away from everybody who's not doing anything.
[00:51:04.896 --> 00:51:06.117]  Yeah, that's exactly the point.
[00:51:06.477 --> 00:51:12.040]  So now there's some controversy as to whether Ross Ulbricht is the dread Pirate Roberts.
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:17.642]  And we don't get too much into this in the report, but anybody who's interested, you can go see the film and find out what I'm talking about.
[00:51:17.662 --> 00:51:19.883]  Basically, it is a mantle.
[00:51:21.284 --> 00:51:24.426]  A Dread Pirate Roberts, when he drops out, the new guy comes, the new guy comes.
[00:51:24.947 --> 00:51:30.670]  And they were questioning whether or not Ross Ulbricht was the Dread Pirate Roberts who was putting out hits on people.
[00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:30.971]  Right.
[00:51:31.031 --> 00:51:39.956]  So that was the big controversy, even though it's my understanding he was never convicted or even formally charged as doing these horrible actions.
[00:51:40.016 --> 00:51:43.559]  It's really more or less something that convicted him in the court of public opinion.
[00:51:43.639 --> 00:51:47.762]  Well, and as far as I know, nothing really happened and you had government agents
[00:51:48.649 --> 00:51:52.471]  Posing as fake people, setting up fake accounts, embezzling money.
[00:51:52.651 --> 00:51:54.051]  Some of this money, they don't even know where it went.
[00:51:54.091 --> 00:51:54.891]  Some of the bitcoins and stuff.
[00:51:54.972 --> 00:52:02.154]  At the end of the film, they point out how a couple of these federal agents were suspected of having stolen over a million dollars in bitcoins.
[00:52:02.334 --> 00:52:02.895]  Oh, no big deal.
[00:52:03.075 --> 00:52:15.280]  And other things, they were wondering, this didn't ever make it to the trial, but they were wondering if these federal agents were actually breaking the law to go about this, like if they were hacking into people's computers and using other illegal activities.
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.200]  If you and I did it,
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.500]  Right.
[00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:18.561]  We'd be in prison right now.
[00:52:18.601 --> 00:52:19.761]  We wouldn't even be talking about this.
[00:52:20.181 --> 00:52:21.681]  So it goes over all that stuff.
[00:52:22.141 --> 00:52:25.022]  As far as the film itself, this is a more condensed version.
[00:52:25.042 --> 00:52:30.223]  We had a chance to speak to the director, Alex Winter, and also a few other people who were there at the screening.
[00:52:30.443 --> 00:52:35.985]  Alright, well let's go to that interview now, and this will pretty much be the end of the show, so we'll wrap it up right after this.
[00:52:38.885 --> 00:52:41.827]  We're here with Alex Winter, the director of Deep Web.
[00:52:42.388 --> 00:52:43.148]  It was a great film.
[00:52:43.189 --> 00:52:43.869]  I really enjoyed it.
[00:52:43.969 --> 00:52:48.453]  It educated me on a lot of things I didn't really know about Silk Road or Mr. Ross.
[00:52:48.993 --> 00:52:51.595]  And briefly, can you just tell our viewers what the film's about?
[00:52:52.196 --> 00:52:58.301]  It's mostly about the rise and fall of the Silk Road and the Ross Ulbricht trial.
[00:52:58.561 --> 00:53:01.183]  I am Chris of The Crypto Show on 89.1 as well.
[00:53:02.702 --> 00:53:04.083]  And how are you involved with this screening?
[00:53:05.544 --> 00:53:10.847]  Well, we actually did a fundraiser for Ross Ulbricht two weeks ago, raised over $3,500.
[00:53:11.247 --> 00:53:17.010]  And Alex Winter, the creator of Deep Web, actually Skyped in and did an interview with us.
[00:53:17.531 --> 00:53:22.894]  I'm Danny Sessom and I do, basically I book all the shows and kind of pick the themes and what we're going to do.
[00:53:22.974 --> 00:53:28.117]  And I basically organized the whole fundraiser here and got this whole thing set up.
[00:53:28.237 --> 00:53:46.468]  Hi, my name is Julia Taransky from bravetheworld.com and I was at the Ross Ulbrich trial for almost every single day of the month-long occurrence and it was abhorrently orchestrated and predetermined and this was obvious in the way that
[00:53:47.068 --> 00:54:01.414]  The judge held up all of the prosecution's issues with the defense, meanwhile completely censoring the defense as far as denying witnesses from even going on the stand.
[00:54:02.555 --> 00:54:09.078]  I think that Judge Forrest gave Chuck Schumer a happy ending with the sentencing.
[00:54:09.358 --> 00:54:19.026]  Now, one of the more prominent figures in the film is Senator Chuckie Schumer, who is spearheading a, I guess, campaign to take down the Silk Road, saying that it was being used for all types of illegal activities.
[00:54:19.066 --> 00:54:24.091]  Of course, we know any drug dealer can go buy, you know, a pound of heroin on the street corner with a $100 bill.
[00:54:24.571 --> 00:54:31.337]  So, with that in mind, how big of an issue do you think the Silk Road was as far as facilitating the drug trade?
[00:54:32.133 --> 00:54:42.583]  I think that the Silk Road was certainly frightening to law enforcement because of what it did and because of what they were afraid it could do.
[00:54:43.564 --> 00:54:50.451]  I think that the idea of a free market that was unregulated using an unregulated currency
[00:54:51.352 --> 00:55:06.366]  Um, that was moving, uh, drugs, um, you know, essentially tax free, um, around the world, uh, is you, you can count the ways that that's threatening to government and law enforcement.
[00:55:06.907 --> 00:55:13.093]  Um, I think from Schumer's perspective and this is, you know, just hypothesis, um, I think it probably
[00:55:14.105 --> 00:55:17.392]  Uh, it probably, uh, threatened him on three levels, primary.
[00:55:17.532 --> 00:55:18.314]  One is the drug war.
[00:55:18.334 --> 00:55:20.078]  He's always been a very big proponent of the drug war.
[00:55:20.499 --> 00:55:24.527]  Two was financial regulation, which is something else the Southern District of New York is very...
[00:55:25.649 --> 00:55:51.637]  involved in obviously it's where Wall Street is and Schumer's very involved in Wall Street and Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are have been on the radar of Wall Street and financial regulations people so you know I'm sure they were calling Schumer up to saying what's going on and would you please shut this down as quickly as humanly possible and the third is cyber and this whole notion of the internet is this big boogeyman that is teeming with you know
[00:55:52.173 --> 00:55:56.315]  Anarchist, hoodie-wearing hackers out to destroy the world.
[00:55:57.456 --> 00:56:04.660]  It's terrifying to a lot of people, especially of a certain age who probably don't know much about technology or really understand technology.
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:14.926]  So I think they looked at the Silk Road and it was just, it hit all three of these issues and they thought, oh my god, this is like, this is a tsunami of illegality and it must be destroyed.
[00:56:15.936 --> 00:56:24.121]  I think, unfortunately, a lot of the fight against the Silk Road, whatever you think of it, even if you think it's horrible, and you think everything they did was wrong, it lacked nuance.
[00:56:24.321 --> 00:56:31.105]  It was sort of like attacking a problem with a sledgehammer with a blindfold on, as opposed to using surgical tools.
[00:56:31.425 --> 00:56:36.968]  And the movie attempts to really deconstruct, actually, what the Silk Road was, whether you like it or not.
[00:56:37.028 --> 00:56:42.572]  It's not a big film saying that it was all great, but it is saying,
[00:56:43.697 --> 00:56:44.658]  Here's what their motives were.
[00:56:45.739 --> 00:56:46.420]  Here's how it worked.
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:47.101]  Here's what it did.
[00:56:47.161 --> 00:56:48.182]  Here's what it didn't do.
[00:56:48.443 --> 00:56:49.644]  Now, go make up your mind.
[00:56:50.024 --> 00:56:56.432]  Final thoughts regarding this is, you know, really the Silk Road story, Ross's story, the story of the Darknet is just beginning.
[00:56:56.872 --> 00:56:59.215]  This is a movie that was about the beginning of something, not the end.
[00:56:59.235 --> 00:57:01.217]  So people should educate themselves.
[00:57:01.237 --> 00:57:02.138]  They should get involved.
[00:57:02.939 --> 00:57:08.607]  And then for me, I'm making a documentary about Frank Zappa now, so I'm doing something completely different.
[00:57:08.968 --> 00:57:17.961]  The Zappa movie I'm making is really about this amazing artist at the end of the 20th century who embodied a lot of different things.
[00:57:18.962 --> 00:57:22.926]  He was a great musician, you know, sort of pop-cultural rock jazz musician.
[00:57:23.226 --> 00:57:24.848]  He was a great classical composer.
[00:57:25.409 --> 00:57:30.894]  He was, you know, super anti-drug, which is really interesting for that era and for the type of music that he made.
[00:57:30.994 --> 00:57:35.639]  He was very suspicious of institutional malfeasance, you know, coming out of the 60s and 70s.
[00:57:35.659 --> 00:57:36.280]  How couldn't you be?
[00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:39.203]  I am always very interested in paradoxical
[00:57:40.484 --> 00:57:49.325]  historical characters who aren't so easily defined, who are very liberty or freedom-minded, because they end up being very fascinating and dramatic.
[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:51.860]  Alex and Wynter, thank you for your time, sir.
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:52.901]  Thank you.
[00:57:52.961 --> 00:57:53.821]  Well, there you go.
[00:57:53.921 --> 00:57:58.882]  You build a website that cuts in on the government's drug dealing action, you too could end up with life in prison.
[00:57:59.522 --> 00:58:00.503]  So that's our show tonight.
[00:58:00.543 --> 00:58:02.643]  We'll be here every weekday, 7 p.m.

[00:58:39.586 --> 00:58:39.846]  Central.
[00:58:40.026 --> 00:58:40.467]  It's Rob Dew.
[00:58:40.547 --> 00:58:40.747]  Thanks.
[00:58:48.456 --> 00:58:49.457]  Brain Force is here.
[00:58:49.997 --> 00:58:52.299]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:58:52.559 --> 00:59:00.444]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:59:00.884 --> 00:59:05.707]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:59:06.228 --> 00:59:08.109]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:59:08.449 --> 00:59:12.852]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:59:13.052 --> 00:59:15.114]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:59:15.695 --> 00:59:17.196]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:59:17.316 --> 00:59:17.457]  Exactly.
[00:59:17.477 --> 00:59:21.381]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:59:21.906 --> 00:59:29.329]  And that's the principle of InfoWarsLife as far as I understand that you've always had is that it's not about synthetic chemicals and forcing actions.
[00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:37.673]  It's about letting your body do its own thing and giving your body the tools it needs to create these different compounds that are super valuable and super beneficial.
[00:59:37.973 --> 00:59:44.276]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
