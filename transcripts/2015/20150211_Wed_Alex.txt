[00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.058]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.200]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:17.902]  Mainstream Media.
[00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:19.743]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:21.204]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:22.865]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:27.167]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:31.830]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:41.517]  People do not seem to understand
[00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:51.403]  That so many people come to government knowing that they're not going to make the kind of money that they would make in the private sector.
[00:00:52.604 --> 00:01:00.790]  But they come to government to feed their souls, to help other people, to lift them up, to make their lives better.
[00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:04.072]  And that's you and you and you and you.
[00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:04.393]  And so
[00:01:06.184 --> 00:01:09.988]  And so the state is God under the New World Order.
[00:01:10.148 --> 00:01:14.773]  You joined the priesthood and gave up everything because you wanted to feed your soul.
[00:01:15.453 --> 00:01:17.876]  You wanted to join with God.
[00:01:19.197 --> 00:01:20.899]  The New World Order is the state is God.
[00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:25.744]  There are some people that do join government because they want to make a difference and help people.
[00:01:25.784 --> 00:01:26.705]  That is certainly true.
[00:01:26.745 --> 00:01:27.746]  But overall,
[00:01:29.482 --> 00:01:43.108]  The claim that the majority of people are doing it to, quote, feed their soul shows the sickening disconnect from an incredibly corrupt congressman who's been defending the IRS, persecuting the Tea Party, Christians, and Libertarian and Conservative groups.
[00:01:44.908 --> 00:01:47.209]  He is a perennial abomination.
[00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.751]  And I've seen the different metrics.
[00:01:50.771 --> 00:01:53.712]  In fact, we should do a story countering this, because I know the numbers are out there.
[00:01:53.732 --> 00:01:54.432]  I've seen it many times.
[00:01:55.293 --> 00:01:58.354]  That government workers, for the degrees they have,
[00:01:59.412 --> 00:02:02.753]  Make more money than people in the private sector and have better benefits.
[00:02:03.753 --> 00:02:11.235]  So that's another lie that people in government make less than their counterparts in the private sector.
[00:02:12.455 --> 00:02:22.138]  Yes, on the high end, CEO-type things, of course the CEO makes more than, say, the head of the Justice Department, which is a major position over hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:02:23.248 --> 00:02:32.930]  But when you become the head of the Justice Department, when you leave it in four to eight years, you then get millions a year for another decade or longer on different boards.
[00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:46.793]  Or you get put on the board or made part owner of the naked body scanner company that makes four billion dollars in one year, and you personally get twenty-something million dollars like Chertoff, the head of Homeland Security, got.
[00:02:47.853 --> 00:02:50.354]  It was twenty-three million smackers he got?
[00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:58.510]  He made the order for the naked body scanners while the head of Homeland Security left, and a year later got a nice payday.
[00:03:00.331 --> 00:03:08.937]  If that isn't a conflict of interest, if that isn't a revolving door, if that isn't a payoff, giving yourself the contract, I don't know what is.
[00:03:10.498 --> 00:03:14.641]  But now in government, that is basically ubiquitous.
[00:03:15.141 --> 00:03:17.983]  Stuff that people would get in trouble for a long time ago, they don't.
[00:03:24.096 --> 00:03:34.322]  If you go back 50 years ago, the media would not report on, and people would not get in trouble, if they were, say, in Congress, for cheating on their wife or visiting a hooker.
[00:03:34.642 --> 00:03:35.442]  Not saying that's good.
[00:03:37.103 --> 00:03:40.005]  But that was an issue that affected the general population.
[00:03:40.745 --> 00:03:46.188]  If you got caught stealing, or you got caught giving yourself contracts, you would go to jail.
[00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:48.490]  Not anymore!
[00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:50.270]  Not anymore.
[00:03:50.391 --> 00:03:52.532]  Oh, but they will prosecute you
[00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.287]  If you're the governor in New York visiting a hooker.
[00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:02.971]  See, that's like they went after Clinton for sex in the White House.
[00:04:04.372 --> 00:04:05.513]  And it's fine to cover that.
[00:04:05.613 --> 00:04:06.853]  I mean, Clinton's a terrible guy.
[00:04:06.873 --> 00:04:07.394]  He lied about it.
[00:04:07.874 --> 00:04:09.095]  I did not have sex with that woman.
[00:04:09.615 --> 00:04:10.476]  Drudge broke all that.
[00:04:12.008 --> 00:04:29.720]  But the only reason the media picked up on it is because they could burn him for that, but not get into Iridium Satellite, and Laura Allen Hughes, missile technology, and the Chinese, and cattle futures, and dead members of the cabinet like Vince Foster, on and on and on.
[00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:33.022]  Because the Republicans were knee-deep in that as well.
[00:04:33.303 --> 00:04:37.886]  Ken Starr, the special prosecutor's law firm, was the big law firm for the Communist Chinese in missile deals.
[00:04:39.224 --> 00:04:40.404]  So you can believe that never got touched.
[00:04:40.445 --> 00:04:47.007]  So this is the philosophy, the system they're using of control.
[00:04:47.507 --> 00:04:49.148]  CNBC anchors stunned.
[00:04:49.168 --> 00:04:50.589]  There is no economic recovery.
[00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:51.589]  That clip's coming up.
[00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.913]  We've got a new, some new breaking news that we're codifying right now on the nuke perhaps going off in Ukraine.
[00:05:01.373 --> 00:05:08.076]  Now there's film footage Rob Dew's getting me of folks filming it and then their camera cuts out, which would be an EMP and more.
[00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:13.467]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[00:05:14.227 --> 00:05:20.491]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.

[00:05:39.656 --> 00:05:43.157]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:43.298 --> 00:05:47.279]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:49.040]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:56.943]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[00:07:09.366 --> 00:07:12.430]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[00:07:12.751 --> 00:07:16.036]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[00:07:16.256 --> 00:07:22.265]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[00:07:22.345 --> 00:07:23.527]  I'm all about human potential.
[00:07:23.727 --> 00:07:25.870]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.431]  The establishment is the opposite.
[00:07:27.511 --> 00:07:32.032]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[00:07:32.293 --> 00:07:36.674]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[00:07:36.894 --> 00:07:39.235]  How we can come together and win the human race.

[00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.918]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.809]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:41.044 --> 00:08:43.745]  Careful what you wish, you just might get it.
[00:08:44.386 --> 00:08:52.430]  You just might get a planetary world government run by psychopathic tyrants who believe they're gonna merge with machines and become God.
[00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:58.653]  But only after they have exterminated the scourge from the face of the Earth they call Homo Sapien Sapien.
[00:09:00.274 --> 00:09:03.636]  Yes, that sounds like the byline for a science fiction movie, but it's not.
[00:09:04.956 --> 00:09:05.917]  It's reality.
[00:09:07.765 --> 00:09:15.069]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this Wednesday, the 11th day of February, 2015, worldwide transmission.
[00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.611]  I am now 41 years old!
[00:09:19.532 --> 00:09:25.936]  And the only thing I ask on my birthday is that no one wish me happy birthday, and that we just move on from it.
[00:09:27.197 --> 00:09:30.479]  Just move on, because, you know, I'm not upset I'm 41.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:37.043]  But at the same time, it is very interesting to see how fast life does go by.
[00:09:38.567 --> 00:09:39.607]  It just accelerates.
[00:09:40.327 --> 00:09:59.512]  As you get older, I'd always heard that from my parents and grandparents and great-grandparents, and it's certainly, certainly true that when I was a little kid, I mean, it seemed like Christmas would take a million years to get there, or my birthday would take a thousand years to get there, and sitting there in church would be incredibly boring, and two hours felt like 20 years.
[00:10:00.212 --> 00:10:05.193]  Well, now, I just kind of enjoy something coming up in a month or two.
[00:10:06.193 --> 00:10:11.056]  I enjoy it when I'm not in a hurry and it takes an hour for them to bring out the food at a restaurant.
[00:10:12.557 --> 00:10:35.431]  I enjoy just sitting on a dock fishing and letting the time go by as slowly as possible because however the brain works it's just it's the years are going by like weeks went by when I was 10 years old and I guess it just goes faster and faster from here on out but you know it's not just individually as we get older things seem to move quicker
[00:10:37.438 --> 00:10:41.741]  Technological developments are moving faster and faster.
[00:10:42.201 --> 00:10:43.762]  Inventions are increasing.
[00:10:44.303 --> 00:10:46.924]  Technologies are integrating together faster and faster.
[00:10:47.184 --> 00:10:59.433]  There are so many amazing opportunities in all of this, but let's not blink and then our lives go by and we've had our whole culture, our whole civilization, our whole genetic code turned over to the technocrats.
[00:10:59.933 --> 00:11:02.695]  This is about free will in the final equation.
[00:11:04.346 --> 00:11:07.387]  Dan Cofall has a show out of Dallas.
[00:11:07.627 --> 00:11:09.168]  He's interviewed the Federal Reserve head there.
[00:11:09.688 --> 00:11:12.089]  He's done a really great job over the years.
[00:11:12.229 --> 00:11:13.369]  I'm a listener of the show.
[00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:22.153]  We're going to have Dan on with us for 30 minutes at the bottom of the hour to talk about a host of issues.
[00:11:22.913 --> 00:11:30.016]  We're going to be getting into global financial metrics and how those metrics tell the future, Greek exit from the EU, Russia and China both want the U.S.
[00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:32.517]  materially weakened, EMPs
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:47.182]  Our lose-lose, dollar weakness, Baltic Dry Index lowest it's ever been, oil demand dropping, Great Depression, food lines now called EBT cards, derivatives at risk over Greece, about 30 trillion, enough to sink the world.
[00:11:48.573 --> 00:11:50.015]  And he's not a very alarmist guy.
[00:11:50.035 --> 00:11:54.981]  Those are pretty alarmist talking points he wants to go over today with us.
[00:11:55.141 --> 00:12:02.649]  And then, Vani Hari, the food babe has really broken into the big time and is now all over the news.
[00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:03.530]  General Mills,
[00:12:06.408 --> 00:12:12.133]  Has now capitulated and says they'll remove BHT from cereals and a bunch of other dangerous additives.
[00:12:12.233 --> 00:12:13.114]  That's a major victory.
[00:12:13.454 --> 00:12:15.917]  I'd like to be able to buy General Mills cereal.
[00:12:15.977 --> 00:12:17.938]  I mean, I'm not a food snob here.
[00:12:17.999 --> 00:12:20.321]  I just don't want a bunch of GMO and a bunch of glyphosates.
[00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:27.487]  Also, companies are backing out of more and more milk that's connected to Monsanto and has glyphosate in it.
[00:12:27.887 --> 00:12:32.492]  I mean, there is a lot of positive stuff happening in what we've got left of a market.
[00:12:33.254 --> 00:12:35.315]  Where you can truly vote is in a free market.
[00:12:35.896 --> 00:12:40.339]  And that's why the globalists are at war with free markets, while scapegoating capitalism.
[00:12:41.099 --> 00:12:55.369]  But, um... Breyers drops milk... Yeah, Breyers drops milk, tainted with Monsanto's R-B-S-T.
[00:12:55.869 --> 00:12:57.190]  Of course, that's the growth hormone.
[00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:59.972]  Yet another victory in the battle for proper health.
[00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:10.384]  How about for not having daughters that are 8 feet tall and who go into puberty at age 7 and who are having babies at 12 and then are dead of cancer at 36?
[00:13:10.424 --> 00:13:22.791]  Because if you look at the studies, that growth hormone, just like glyphosate, accelerates growth in tissues for whatever reason, especially in women.
[00:13:23.564 --> 00:13:31.708]  That's why there's a phenomenon, and you'll go to the mall or any public place, you'll see two parents that are obviously the biological parents of girls.
[00:13:32.248 --> 00:13:34.429]  They'll have a son there that's a little bit taller than them.
[00:13:34.709 --> 00:13:38.911]  They'll have a daughter that's like six and a half feet tall, and the parents are 5'10", 5'7".
[00:13:39.051 --> 00:13:41.953]  And it's growth hormone.
[00:13:42.313 --> 00:13:49.036]  We are now 30 years plus into this synthetic growth hormone that is in the milk.
[00:13:49.917 --> 00:13:52.018]  And maybe you want to take growth hormone when you're 50.
[00:13:53.317 --> 00:13:56.300]  It's got risk associated with it, but it does make you look younger.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.401]  I've seen studies on that.
[00:13:58.222 --> 00:14:01.986]  But no, we're not talking about human identical growth hormone in low levels.
[00:14:02.326 --> 00:14:07.932]  We're talking about cheap, mass-produced, bovine growth hormone in the milk.
[00:14:09.614 --> 00:14:10.275]  It's not good.
[00:14:11.396 --> 00:14:13.878]  And you want to accelerate aging?
[00:14:14.844 --> 00:14:20.226]  When you're old, growth hormone, they can argue, can slow aging or reverse it, but then it'll also grow cancers.
[00:14:20.487 --> 00:14:21.327]  It's been connected to that.
[00:14:21.667 --> 00:14:34.053]  But you give it to somebody that's already fast-growing, already in the middle of their youth, you take anabolic steroids when you're 14 years old, it's gonna start your growth and accelerate your aging, and warp your organs, expand your heart.
[00:14:34.333 --> 00:14:36.294]  Well, you take GH, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:37.304 --> 00:14:39.045]  Bovine GH and other chemicals.
[00:14:39.726 --> 00:14:43.228]  When you are a teenager or going through puberty, you're going to be messed up.
[00:14:43.769 --> 00:14:46.991]  And that's why we got a country full of messed up looking people.
[00:14:48.192 --> 00:14:49.553]  And I'm not trying to be mean here.
[00:14:49.573 --> 00:14:51.714]  We're all messed up from the fluoride, the GMO.
[00:14:51.955 --> 00:14:54.096]  We're all kind of walking dead at one level or another.
[00:14:54.316 --> 00:14:57.579]  We can still fight back and stop it being done to the next generation.
[00:15:00.541 --> 00:15:01.501]  But that's what's going on.
[00:15:01.582 --> 00:15:06.205]  I mean, if you're wondering why your parents are both average height and you're a foot taller than them, well,
[00:15:07.423 --> 00:15:15.906]  You didn't have acromegalia, naturally, or the disease of giants.
[00:15:15.966 --> 00:15:25.089]  You were given it because they added growth hormone to the cattle so that they would produce double or triple the milk.
[00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.351]  And then you ended up drinking that en masse.
[00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:31.632]  In fact, we should probably even do another report on that.
[00:15:31.672 --> 00:15:32.692]  It's such a big deal.
[00:15:33.592 --> 00:15:34.553]  The companies are
[00:15:35.638 --> 00:15:40.823]  Uh, testing now for glyphosates in milk that bioaccumulate, and then refusing it from suppliers that have it.
[00:15:41.203 --> 00:15:50.612]  They're now testing, because you can't trust these companies, uh, to make sure they don't have the human, uh, equivalent bovine growth hormone, and they're now refusing that.
[00:15:50.652 --> 00:15:54.596]  I mean, every day we're seeing major companies make these announcements.
[00:15:54.856 --> 00:15:56.238]  There is a stampede
[00:15:58.314 --> 00:16:07.097]  In companies, in food producers away from poison, because you are checking the labels and voting with your dollars, and a revolution is happening.
[00:16:12.358 --> 00:16:25.062]  And that's again, while the New World Order says competition is a sin and monopolies are king, because they cannot allow things to be labeled, they cannot allow you to have a choice, they cannot allow you to be educated, or it's over for them.
[00:16:28.615 --> 00:16:29.916]  Now let me get into the other news.
[00:16:31.798 --> 00:16:34.681]  By the end of the show, the last 30 minutes, we should have this ready.
[00:16:35.041 --> 00:16:47.553]  I've got Rob Dew doing a whole piece getting the videos together, getting the English translations with Joe Biggs, and getting the videos clipped together, the different videos.
[00:16:47.573 --> 00:16:48.594]  But there is video.
[00:16:49.976 --> 00:16:53.119]  We've been sent by listeners out of Ukraine.
[00:16:54.226 --> 00:17:04.670]  But again, it's in Ukrainian and Russian, but they're videotaping the explosion that appears to look like an atomic blast, and the camera cuts out.
[00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:13.293]  And we've got other reports in Ukraine, in newspapers, that for miles around, the power is off and electronics don't work.
[00:17:14.093 --> 00:17:21.616]  And it was CJ at the end of the show yesterday said, Alex, there's an easy way to know if this was really a tactical nuke or tactical A-bomb that went off.
[00:17:22.756 --> 00:17:24.998]  Because again, a lot of the tacticals tend to be just atomic.
[00:17:25.018 --> 00:17:30.923]  It's hydrogen are bigger and more complex and tend to fail more, but that's a side issue.
[00:17:32.464 --> 00:17:33.605]  There'd be an EMP.
[00:17:37.568 --> 00:17:38.849]  I'm not a nuclear physicist.
[00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:51.220]  I've just read books written by them, but to understand what causes the EMP, it's that blast of electrons and radiation that goes out that you see first
[00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:57.876]  And then you see the mushroom cloud form, and you see that in this explosion that they claim is a chemical plant.
[00:17:58.317 --> 00:18:04.384]  Well, on Russian and Ukrainian television, we showed this yesterday, they show the supposed crater.
[00:18:04.424 --> 00:18:06.466]  There's no wreckage, no equipment.
[00:18:06.747 --> 00:18:09.390]  You see about two miles off what looks like to be a refinery.
[00:18:11.044 --> 00:18:12.865]  It looks like a oil and gas refinery.
[00:18:13.466 --> 00:18:17.889]  But you're talking about the woods here with blown over trees and a big black crater in the ground.
[00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.112]  And there's somewhat of a news blackout on this.
[00:18:21.972 --> 00:18:24.814]  So, I'm not saying an atomic bomb went off.
[00:18:25.295 --> 00:18:29.078]  I'm saying it looked like tactical nuke test I've seen.
[00:18:29.898 --> 00:18:34.801]  On TV shows that I've watched over and over again like Trinity and Beyond with William Shatner that's all about nukes.
[00:18:35.321 --> 00:18:37.862]  And a lot of other shows I've watched, I've always been fascinated with them.
[00:18:38.203 --> 00:18:40.764]  I mean anybody fascinated with warfare or science would be.
[00:18:41.564 --> 00:18:43.566]  And it just looks unlike any explosion I've ever seen.
[00:18:43.946 --> 00:18:45.707]  And this new footage, it looks just like a nuke.
[00:18:46.307 --> 00:18:48.108]  It's up closer and then the camera cuts out.
[00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:51.110]  So...
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:19:00.406]  We've got the old footage, we're going to get over here, because they're over there, they've got it, the new footage, and again, get to all of that.
[00:19:01.407 --> 00:19:17.561]  And the reason this is important is, the Russians have said in state-run media last year and this year, that they would use tactical nuclear weapons if NATO armored columns or armored brigades, they said if brigade-level weapons
[00:19:19.355 --> 00:19:23.478]  We're talking about 4,000 men, 100 tanks, whatever the numbers are.
[00:19:24.038 --> 00:19:28.981]  If we see something like that, we see that as a major invasion, we're going to hit you with a tactical nuke.
[00:19:29.922 --> 00:19:34.505]  And we know that this Donetsk area is where a lot of the major battles have been going on.
[00:19:34.845 --> 00:19:36.226]  It would be a major signal.
[00:19:37.079 --> 00:19:38.240]  to the west to back off.
[00:19:38.781 --> 00:19:46.247]  Now they did threaten on state-run TV in 2008 to use tactical nukes on US forces in Georgia and NATO forces.
[00:19:46.908 --> 00:19:47.609]  That was on the news.
[00:19:48.169 --> 00:19:51.372]  Didn't get reported here, but it was all over the British and German and Russian news.
[00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:53.955]  So the Russians are threatening.
[00:19:54.395 --> 00:20:00.561]  So we have to look at these explosions and understand that if there was a tactical nuclear weapon used, we're not going to be told about it.
[00:20:01.141 --> 00:20:02.504]  It's a message between governments.
[00:20:03.706 --> 00:20:07.293]  This is starting to lean towards it could be an atomic device.
[00:20:08.495 --> 00:20:08.956]  This is big.
[00:20:09.642 --> 00:20:14.686]  It's no secret that government and big business buy in bulk and get huge discounts, not available to the little guy.

[00:21:10.326 --> 00:21:13.527]  The Feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[00:21:13.947 --> 00:21:17.129]  In January, a newly introduced bill, H.R.
[00:21:17.369 --> 00:21:21.031]  378, will take away your right to buy level 3 and higher body armor.

[00:22:12.892 --> 00:22:17.614]  Some of the founders of our modern holistic health thinking state that disease begins in a toxic colon.
[00:22:17.734 --> 00:22:21.616]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease.

[00:22:35.763 --> 00:22:39.684]  Within a few days of taking One World Whey, I noticed a dramatic change.
[00:22:39.925 --> 00:22:43.786]  Also, in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[00:22:44.006 --> 00:22:47.448]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar, and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[00:22:47.568 --> 00:22:51.533]  But I've noticed in the past week or so, I'm not feeling bad anymore, and the foot pain is gone.
[00:22:51.713 --> 00:22:55.918]  I'm just finishing up a five-pound tub I ordered and just got off the phone ordering more.
[00:22:56.078 --> 00:22:56.979]  I love your product.

[00:24:29.168 --> 00:24:39.230]  At infowars.com forward slash show you can find the free video and audio feeds.
[00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:41.050]  So many stories here to get to.
[00:24:42.904 --> 00:24:43.965]  So many reports.
[00:24:44.945 --> 00:24:46.166]  Look at this little jewel.
[00:24:46.706 --> 00:24:51.930]  Elizabeth Warren opposes congressional meddling and audit the Fed bill.
[00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:56.052]  Oh, she's the darling that was going to crack down on the big mega bankers.
[00:24:56.472 --> 00:24:58.133]  She was the classy Hillary.
[00:25:00.035 --> 00:25:02.896]  It would appear the powers that be are getting nervous.
[00:25:04.958 --> 00:25:11.602]  So we're going to be breaking that down and playing that clip of the former head of the Federal Reserve saying they're above the law when Dan Cofall joins us.
[00:25:13.046 --> 00:25:14.006]  We're also going to look at this story.
[00:25:14.166 --> 00:25:15.167]  Our House of Cards.
[00:25:16.247 --> 00:25:20.029]  Those who have rigged the system know that it's a House of Cards.
[00:25:20.069 --> 00:25:25.851]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and Dave Krasler.
[00:25:26.671 --> 00:25:31.793]  And it breaks down the fact that a lot of the elites are pulling their money out and heading for the hills.
[00:25:33.694 --> 00:25:35.594]  Here's another interesting little headline.
[00:25:35.614 --> 00:25:39.996]  90% of big pharma money spent on marketing than research.
[00:25:43.066 --> 00:25:44.787]  That's just some of the news on that front.
[00:25:46.689 --> 00:25:52.013]  Video of the day, John Oliver on Pharma Company, marketing to doctors.
[00:25:52.254 --> 00:25:55.536]  70% of all Americans take at least one prescription medication.
[00:25:56.297 --> 00:26:00.400]  They want to make it mandatory through the New Freedom Initiative in public schools.
[00:26:01.001 --> 00:26:01.621]  The New Freedom.
[00:26:03.303 --> 00:26:07.846]  But shifting gears, Brian Williams is out for six months.
[00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:11.770]  They hope you'll forget that he is a congenital liar about Katrina.
[00:26:13.027 --> 00:26:24.495]  And about the helicopter that he was in being shot down, and then, oh, he was behind a helicopter that got shot down, and then in front of a helicopter that got shot down, and then he was right behind it, and then he was never there, and then it was an hour and a half.
[00:26:26.096 --> 00:26:27.977]  He is a lying scumbag.
[00:26:28.918 --> 00:26:30.039]  But he's not lying to us.
[00:26:30.079 --> 00:26:35.142]  I mean, he did lie to us about guns and about Obamacare, but, I mean, those are the big lies.
[00:26:35.742 --> 00:26:39.085]  Why are we mad at him lying about stolen heroics?
[00:26:40.219 --> 00:26:41.520]  Because it's something simple.
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:42.841]  It's something cut and dry.
[00:26:44.221 --> 00:26:46.303]  Like Gruber saying, you know what?
[00:26:47.923 --> 00:26:49.424]  It's good the American people are stupid.
[00:26:50.025 --> 00:26:54.747]  And it's good that we were able to deceive them that Obamacare really increases their prices and has death panels.
[00:26:54.947 --> 00:26:56.728]  And then he laughs with the other academics.
[00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:59.610]  This is the attitude of these people.
[00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:01.511]  But they still go too far.
[00:27:01.771 --> 00:27:02.612]  They're not invincible.
[00:27:03.786 --> 00:27:15.294]  But if Tom Brokaw and others want him fired, which effectively they're starting to phase him out in a face-saving way, with us out for six months, then he'll be brought back with occasional reports, little side things.
[00:27:15.874 --> 00:27:17.035]  This is the end of Brian Williams.
[00:27:18.656 --> 00:27:25.700]  But then is it the end of Hillary Clinton, who lied even bigger about being shot at on a trip to Bosnia?
[00:27:27.061 --> 00:27:32.025]  Or what about the Pentagon working with Bruckheimer to stage the heroic
[00:27:33.692 --> 00:27:38.675]  Rescue of Private Lynch, or the lies about Pat Tillman, or the lies in American Sniper.
[00:27:39.156 --> 00:27:46.160]  I mean, if we're mad at Brian Williams lying about being a hero, what about Chris Kyle lying about knocking out Jesse Ventura?
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.601]  I mean, it isn't true.
[00:27:50.443 --> 00:27:51.844]  It's been found so in court.
[00:27:52.824 --> 00:27:54.465]  And a bunch of this book is bull.
[00:27:56.527 --> 00:27:59.669]  I love a story about a Texan being the toughest guy around, believe me.
[00:28:01.018 --> 00:28:04.059]  I know a lot of people that act and look and sound just like Chris Kyle.
[00:28:04.919 --> 00:28:08.360]  I'm sure Chris Kyle was a tough guy and a great shot and all these things.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.521]  The point is, is that his story is full of bull.
[00:28:13.661 --> 00:28:16.102]  And Pat Tillman wouldn't go along with the bull, so they killed him.
[00:28:16.122 --> 00:28:21.183]  A bunch of private lynch's team wouldn't go along with it, so they killed them.
[00:28:21.523 --> 00:28:23.624]  That's the point, is they lie to us.
[00:28:23.984 --> 00:28:26.805]  So why are we so upset about Brian Williams?
[00:28:28.231 --> 00:28:30.173]  I can't stand Brian Williams.
[00:28:30.373 --> 00:28:32.474]  I can't stand his condescension.
[00:28:32.554 --> 00:28:41.902]  I can't stand his fake Boy Scout blue eyes when he stares at the camera and demonizes families and the Tea Party and the Second Amendment and basic liberty.
[00:28:42.002 --> 00:28:46.385]  Listen, I love seeing a lying sack of garbage like him fall.
[00:28:48.006 --> 00:28:52.550]  And it's certainly a good thing in the final equation.
[00:28:55.836 --> 00:29:00.258]  To see people get in trouble for bald-faced, naked lies.
[00:29:05.281 --> 00:29:10.203]  But it needs to continue, it needs to expand, they need to go after other liars.
[00:29:11.464 --> 00:29:15.566]  Other people that create fables.
[00:29:15.646 --> 00:29:20.949]  Because the reason he was so comfortable, and Hillary's so comfortable, and so many others are so comfortable, to lie,
[00:29:23.487 --> 00:29:25.709]  Is because they have protected each other.
[00:29:25.989 --> 00:29:30.733]  They've gotten away with so much, why not tell bigger and bigger and bigger lies?
[00:29:31.073 --> 00:29:32.654]  Now, here's the key to the whole thing.
[00:29:33.075 --> 00:29:34.596]  Why did Brian Williams fall?
[00:29:35.597 --> 00:29:46.005]  Because the military, who he tried to have on his TV show and say, join me in the lie, said, listen buddy, you weren't there, you weren't in the crashed helicopter, you're a liar.
[00:29:47.166 --> 00:29:47.607]  That's why.
[00:29:47.927 --> 00:29:50.389]  Because they wouldn't go along with his fraud, he's in trouble.
[00:29:51.638 --> 00:29:52.279]  You understand that?
[00:29:52.359 --> 00:29:56.426]  Again, good people in the system saying no is what will bring down these criminals.
[00:29:57.067 --> 00:29:58.629]  I'm telling you, Brian Williams is just the beginning.
[00:29:58.729 --> 00:29:59.611]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:01.734]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.655 --> 00:30:05.340]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.842 --> 00:30:15.609]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[00:30:15.949 --> 00:30:20.254]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[00:30:20.535 --> 00:30:28.264]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[00:30:28.484 --> 00:30:33.705]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:30:34.005 --> 00:30:39.587]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[00:30:39.947 --> 00:30:44.768]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[00:30:44.908 --> 00:30:48.488]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:30:48.849 --> 00:30:55.050]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[00:30:55.450 --> 00:31:00.436]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[00:31:00.616 --> 00:31:04.140]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.242]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:31:10.247 --> 00:31:12.447]  February is all about Valentine's Day.
[00:31:12.788 --> 00:31:16.008]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[00:31:16.288 --> 00:31:22.269]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[00:31:22.369 --> 00:31:23.550]  I'm all about human potential.
[00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:25.930]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:27.490]  The establishment is the opposite.
[00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:32.091]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[00:31:32.331 --> 00:31:36.712]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[00:31:36.932 --> 00:31:39.233]  How we can come together and win the human race.
[00:31:40.233 --> 00:31:40.593]  We're good.
[00:32:09.247 --> 00:32:17.780]  What disaster is so powerful it unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots all at the same time?
[00:32:18.161 --> 00:32:24.750]  NASA has already set the countdown timer and right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[00:32:25.271 --> 00:32:28.692]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S.
[00:32:28.732 --> 00:32:29.952]  population could perish.
[00:32:30.392 --> 00:32:33.393]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[00:32:33.853 --> 00:32:35.634]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[00:32:36.114 --> 00:32:37.374]  Mass riots will follow.
[00:32:37.735 --> 00:32:39.475]  Ancient diseases will reemerge.
[00:32:39.935 --> 00:32:43.456]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?
[00:32:43.996 --> 00:32:49.678]  Go to darkestdays.info to find out proven methods of protecting yourself, your loved ones,
[00:32:49.938 --> 00:32:51.259]  Zack, this is Crystal Palace.
[00:32:51.319 --> 00:32:51.499]  Inc.
[00:32:51.519 --> 00:32:52.820]  NORAD has declared DEF CON 3.
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.641]  Scramble all alert aircraft.
[00:32:54.661 --> 00:32:57.462]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[00:33:20.011 --> 00:33:23.974]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War III.
[00:33:24.494 --> 00:33:25.955]  Target selection complete.
[00:33:25.995 --> 00:33:29.077]  Time-on-target sequence complete.
[00:33:29.257 --> 00:33:34.761]  22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning south out of Nordkapp, bearing 095 degrees.
[00:33:35.041 --> 00:33:40.405]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan Air Defense Zone.
[00:33:40.905 --> 00:33:47.270]  From the front lines of the Information War... Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:48.711]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[00:33:51.119 --> 00:33:53.360]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.000]  You bet!
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.662]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:58.822 --> 00:34:01.783]  We'll keep control but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[00:34:02.483 --> 00:34:06.945]  Three, two, one, impact.
[00:34:07.225 --> 00:34:09.146]  Shall we play a game?
[00:34:09.306 --> 00:34:09.886]  How about
[00:34:15.231 --> 00:34:19.776]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34:20.077 --> 00:34:22.099]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[00:34:22.379 --> 00:34:23.200]  Awaiting launch codes.
[00:34:23.961 --> 00:34:25.143]  We are on a launch mode.
[00:34:25.583 --> 00:34:29.127]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[00:34:29.528 --> 00:34:33.432]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:34:33.893 --> 00:34:34.193]  We're in!
[00:34:35.375 --> 00:34:36.717]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[00:34:37.118 --> 00:34:39.743]  We have Soviet submarine watch detection.
[00:34:39.763 --> 00:34:41.366]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:43.009]  I wish I was like anybody else.
[00:34:43.029 --> 00:34:44.051]  Games end.
[00:34:45.293 --> 00:34:48.259]  The only winning move is not to play.
[00:34:58.464 --> 00:34:59.765]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:59.825 --> 00:35:01.867]  Welcome back to the World Wide Broadcast.
[00:35:01.907 --> 00:35:05.370]  We have John McCain this week and last week calling for open U.S.
[00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:11.014]  military forces backing NATO to engage the Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.
[00:35:12.856 --> 00:35:15.919]  I'm not Ukrainian, I'm not Russian, but I do know the history of the region.
[00:35:16.219 --> 00:35:18.621]  Both sides have been killing each other for 500 years.
[00:35:18.981 --> 00:35:21.523]  The Russians have controlled Crimea for 500 years.
[00:35:22.704 --> 00:35:25.707]  It's basically like Mexico trying to take Texas or something.
[00:35:27.984 --> 00:35:32.208]  There are political interests that are basically running this country into the ground.
[00:35:32.708 --> 00:35:37.612]  Here's the headline, Elizabeth Warren opposes congressional meddling of audit the Fed bill.
[00:35:37.672 --> 00:35:42.997]  It would appear that the powers that be are getting nervous at Zero Hedge up on Infowars.com.
[00:35:44.438 --> 00:35:48.601]  And joining us to cover the waterfront is Dan Cofall.
[00:35:49.659 --> 00:35:51.880]  He's a talk show host out of Dallas.
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.521]  I've been on his broadcast many times.
[00:35:54.001 --> 00:36:00.864]  He's been with us out there at our In The Fed rallies in Dallas to cover it for Dallas Radio.
[00:36:01.324 --> 00:36:11.789]  And I wanted to get him on our broadcast today to look at the world economy and to break down from different angles what his sources are saying and what he thinks is coming as well.
[00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:13.670]  Dan, thank you so much for coming on.
[00:36:14.311 --> 00:36:16.151]  Oh, man, I appreciate the invitation, Alex.
[00:36:16.191 --> 00:36:16.852]  Thank you so much.
[00:36:17.597 --> 00:36:18.659]  Where do you want to go first?
[00:36:18.679 --> 00:36:19.781]  There's so much to get into.
[00:36:20.663 --> 00:36:30.027]  Well, first, I just want to say that I've listened to you for years, and that you do more good for the American people in your one show than all the rest of the media combined.
[00:36:30.067 --> 00:36:33.388]  I know you don't like people just, you know, praising you like that, but it's true.
[00:36:33.448 --> 00:36:34.288]  I listened to you for years.
[00:36:34.708 --> 00:36:43.992]  Long story short, I got into radio in 2007 to a great extent because of your show and what I had heard.
[00:36:44.012 --> 00:36:46.893]  A friend of mine is the Chief Economist of the Federal Reserve.
[00:36:47.073 --> 00:36:48.974]  He and I would have lunch, argue about
[00:36:49.614 --> 00:36:50.114]  Back and forth.
[00:36:50.415 --> 00:36:51.155]  I was so right.
[00:36:51.175 --> 00:36:52.736]  He suddenly got so upset with me.
[00:36:52.796 --> 00:36:54.677]  He said, I'm going to find a station to put you on.
[00:36:55.358 --> 00:36:57.019]  And the rest was history.
[00:36:59.436 --> 00:37:04.541]  My specialty was always economics and what's going on in the world.
[00:37:04.581 --> 00:37:09.165]  So that's kind of how involved I have, but I have it all because of you.
[00:37:09.665 --> 00:37:12.347]  Well, Dan, please don't talk about me anymore.
[00:37:12.387 --> 00:37:17.411]  I'm just glad that you and so many other people have been spurred because of this broadcast to start your own radio shows.
[00:37:17.732 --> 00:37:26.459]  Because I know you've gotten pretty good ratings up there in Dallas, been on several different stations, and we salute you for that work you're doing covering these issues.
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.760]  Where do you want to go first?
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:34.142]  Because, I mean, obviously the economy's not as good as they're claiming.
[00:37:34.482 --> 00:37:37.242]  What is your view on the state of the U.S.
[00:37:37.403 --> 00:37:38.703]  and world economy in general?
[00:37:39.143 --> 00:37:44.424]  Well, here's where I start out, and it's the fact that people talk about how the economy is recovering.
[00:37:44.684 --> 00:37:50.366]  They talk about all these wonderful numbers, employment numbers, and everything, it's rosy, and none of it's rosy.
[00:37:50.746 --> 00:37:54.587]  I believe you cannot possibly have a good analysis if you're working off of bad facts.
[00:37:54.947 --> 00:38:02.816]  We're intentionally being fed bad facts by the Federal Reserve, the BEA, the BLS, all the people who give us these key numbers.
[00:38:03.136 --> 00:38:06.159]  These numbers aren't anything of what they look like.
[00:38:06.579 --> 00:38:12.366]  The inflation numbers, it's impossible to assume there's a 1.5-2% inflation number.
[00:38:12.886 --> 00:38:16.230]  I know you and I share a friend in John Williams at Shadow Stats.
[00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:19.053]  And his numbers are spot on.
[00:38:19.353 --> 00:38:27.962]  So what you've got is, you've got people in the investment world making decisions and they're developing their whole narrative off of horrible financial numbers.
[00:38:28.022 --> 00:38:29.884]  I'll give you one in particular, Alex.
[00:38:30.284 --> 00:38:32.506]  I know you were joking about this before the show.
[00:38:33.207 --> 00:38:35.409]  Something called the Baltic Dry Index.
[00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:39.352]  Such an obscure thing, but it's so meaningful to the whole world.
[00:38:39.772 --> 00:38:46.435]  It measures how many goods are being shipped back and forth between countries around the world.
[00:38:46.815 --> 00:38:53.279]  It has never been, never, this is almost 40 years this index has been around, it's never, ever been lower.
[00:38:53.319 --> 00:38:58.381]  That means never has there been less product moving around the world than there is right now.
[00:38:58.982 --> 00:39:01.183]  That's a horrifying number, but you don't see it anymore.
[00:39:01.203 --> 00:39:05.285]  Is that why the Chinese are selling steel at cheaper than it is to produce?
[00:39:05.965 --> 00:39:15.096]  Yeah, and also another good indication is when you look at China and the amount of electricity usage that they're using, that's a very good indication of how strong an economy is.
[00:39:15.236 --> 00:39:19.421]  And their usage of electricity has been steadily declining, not growing.
[00:39:19.481 --> 00:39:21.063]  You can't have that growing economy.
[00:39:22.389 --> 00:39:25.894]  So what is the real state of the economy globally then in your view?
[00:39:26.816 --> 00:39:28.759]  Alright, you touched on derivatives.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:36.891]  I think the next conflict in this world, even though it looks horrible in Ukraine, nuclear weapons maybe, maybe not.
[00:39:37.812 --> 00:39:41.836]  It's the financial world where the next major conflict will occur.
[00:39:41.876 --> 00:39:42.917]  We talk about derivatives.
[00:39:43.217 --> 00:39:50.803]  There's somewhere between one and two quadrillion, which is a thousand, you know what that is, it's a thousand trillion in derivatives out there.
[00:39:51.424 --> 00:39:54.866]  Twenty-five trillion roughly linked to the euro.
[00:39:55.107 --> 00:39:58.910]  Twenty-five trillion roughly are linked to oil and gas.
[00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:06.136]  If you have oil dropping to twenty-five dollars a barrel, you will effectively make roughly twenty-five
[00:40:06.636 --> 00:40:08.119]  A trillion dollars' worth of derivatives.
[00:40:20.993 --> 00:40:27.975]  Either one of them is $25 trillion, and that roughly represents one-third of the world's total GDP.
[00:40:28.435 --> 00:40:34.037]  Well, imagine, Alex, if you make $100,000 a year, that's your income.
[00:40:34.077 --> 00:40:35.217]  That's GDP.
[00:40:35.697 --> 00:40:43.599]  So now imagine that all of a sudden, $20,000 out of that just disappears.
[00:40:43.639 --> 00:40:44.720]  Your life would change.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:45.560]  Everything would change.
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.380]  And that's what the world is facing right now.
[00:40:47.821 --> 00:40:49.061]  And it's the domino effect.
[00:40:49.401 --> 00:40:49.801]  I agree.
[00:40:49.841 --> 00:40:55.505]  I want to get into that, but your Skype is sort of deteriorating, so we're going to reconnect with you, Dan, right now up in Dallas.
[00:40:55.785 --> 00:40:56.926]  We're here in Austin, Texas.
[00:40:56.946 --> 00:40:59.088]  If you just joined us, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:40:59.448 --> 00:41:02.430]  And while we're reconnecting with Dan, I'm going to air this clip.
[00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:04.251]  CNBC anchor stunned.
[00:41:04.632 --> 00:41:06.353]  There is no economic recovery.
[00:41:06.393 --> 00:41:13.458]  Investor launches into breathless rant about real financial system.
[00:41:14.278 --> 00:41:25.962]  This is one of the chief financial strategists, Rajudo, a managing director of M-I-Z-U-H-O Securities, which is a pretty big firm.
[00:41:26.862 --> 00:41:31.663]  And this is not just him saying this, but John Williams, the list goes on and on.
[00:41:31.924 --> 00:41:33.544]  They're all pretty much saying the same thing.
[00:41:34.024 --> 00:41:34.764]  Here is that clip.
[00:41:35.024 --> 00:41:38.586]  If you look at the domestic economic conditions, I hear all this discussion about the U.S.
[00:41:38.606 --> 00:41:39.666]  economy accelerating.
[00:41:40.106 --> 00:41:49.812]  If you look at the GDP number that we're probably going to have in the revised report for the fourth quarter, combine that with the negative report in the first quarter, average growth for all of 2014 is about 2.3%.
[00:41:50.892 --> 00:41:52.853]  Fourth quarter over fourth quarter growth will be about 2.2%.
[00:41:53.134 --> 00:41:56.796]  That's really where the economy's been growing over the last five years.
[00:41:56.836 --> 00:41:59.777]  There is no acceleration in underlying economic activity.
[00:42:00.158 --> 00:42:03.760]  Nominal GDP growth is running approximately around 4% where it's been growing.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.442]  Now we've had a nice pickup in employment in the last couple of months, there's no doubt about that.
[00:42:07.842 --> 00:42:09.143]  That's squeezing productivity.
[00:42:09.483 --> 00:42:18.329]  The squeeze in productivity is not going to be allowed to go on very long by corporate America, who needs very strong earnings to justify the multiples that they're getting in the stock market.
[00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:26.235]  So either we're going to have a decline in the earnings numbers, or we're going to have multiples be maintained by stronger earnings, which is going to mean a slowdown in employment going forward.
[00:42:26.575 --> 00:42:34.701]  And I think that's really going to be the limiting factor on the Fed, as well as the deflationary forces that are taking place overseas, that we could also import on a stronger dollar.
[00:42:38.644 --> 00:42:39.965]  And then the anchors are stunned.
[00:42:39.985 --> 00:42:40.906]  You can watch the full clip.
[00:42:40.926 --> 00:42:45.250]  There's a couple more minutes left at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:52.436]  You dovetail this attitude with Elizabeth Warren, who's opposing congressional, quote, meddling.
[00:42:52.896 --> 00:43:01.084]  Well, Congress controls the power of the purse, so shouldn't they be able to audit the so-called Federal Reserve?
[00:43:01.104 --> 00:43:02.245]  What do you say about that, Dan?
[00:43:03.488 --> 00:43:05.249]  Absolutely.
[00:43:05.269 --> 00:43:08.850]  The Federal Reserve is a one-man show.
[00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:10.091]  It's loyal to nobody.
[00:43:10.111 --> 00:43:16.153]  Never once, by the way, in the history of the Federal Reserve have they ever said America or Americans are their priority.
[00:43:16.493 --> 00:43:22.416]  It's always been the banking system of America or the banking system of the world is their priority.
[00:43:22.856 --> 00:43:25.857]  We don't even exist on their list of priorities.
[00:43:26.397 --> 00:43:31.179]  Well, that's right, and most of the banker bailout money ended up going to foreign banks.
[00:43:31.199 --> 00:43:35.300]  I mean, we could have given, in the bailout, $30,000 to every family in America.
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.561]  We would have had inflation, but at least it would have done something for the economy.
[00:43:38.601 --> 00:43:46.524]  Instead, it just went into derivatives, which you're sort of getting into the domino effect when you're Skype cut out of derivatives if they get triggered.
[00:43:47.224 --> 00:43:50.445]  From your research, I know you have a lot of top experts on your show, and you're a pretty
[00:43:50.825 --> 00:43:51.945]  Smart guy in your own right.
[00:43:52.185 --> 00:43:57.626]  How big are the derivatives overhang, and where do you expect the next bubble to pop?
[00:43:58.667 --> 00:44:01.947]  Well, the derivatives overhang, you can't really get an exact number.
[00:44:01.967 --> 00:44:12.169]  It's somewhere between 1 quadrillion and 2 quadrillion, and roughly 25 trillion relate to oil, and another 25 trillion relate to the euro.
[00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:19.591]  So if Greece pulls out of the EU, that will significantly affect the euro, and it could make 25 trillion.
[00:44:20.051 --> 00:44:20.551]  I think so.
[00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:57.026]  You know, Dan, my grandmother's brother, worked at the Dallas Federal Reserve once he got out of the Navy, and we would have debates about the Federal Reserve, but before he died six, seven years ago, he listened to the show, my Uncle Billy, and he said, Billy Pope was his name, he said, you know, you really are right about this, and a lot of the people in the Federal Reserve were upset,
[00:44:57.566 --> 00:45:01.109]  So it's not just like the Federal Reserve's been monolithic the whole time.
[00:45:01.149 --> 00:45:05.592]  I mean, it was a quasi-private banking group that took over in 1913 with some robber barons.
[00:45:05.672 --> 00:45:09.154]  It's had some policies that were for the cabal, not the American people.
[00:45:09.495 --> 00:45:18.881]  But I think it's clear now there is a major split in the Federal Reserve with the head of the Dallas and Kansas City Fed becoming very, very critical of the New York Fed.
[00:45:19.162 --> 00:45:23.865]  So for folks that don't know the inside baseball, you know some of the folks pretty high level at the Federal Reserve.
[00:45:24.205 --> 00:45:26.167]  What are they telling you and what's really going on?
[00:45:26.727 --> 00:45:27.971]  I mean, I looked at the history of the Federal Reserve.
[00:45:27.991 --> 00:45:33.768]  I've never seen these unprecedented statements by different Fed branches against the New York Fed.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.762]  Well, my friend used to be Chief Economist for the entire Federal Reserve.
[00:45:37.802 --> 00:45:40.083]  He happened to office out of Dallas.
[00:45:40.103 --> 00:45:43.164]  When he was with the Federal Reserve, he was this internal optimist.
[00:45:43.204 --> 00:45:44.125]  GDP is right.
[00:45:44.185 --> 00:45:44.925]  Inflation is right.
[00:45:44.985 --> 00:45:45.665]  Everything is right.
[00:45:46.005 --> 00:45:57.331]  And I would talk to him about things like the substitution effect and all those things that are something that he had worked on personally and came up with, which was there to goose the GDP to make Alan Greenspan happy.
[00:45:57.351 --> 00:46:03.794]  Because Greenspan's philosophy always was that GDP is understated because we're more productive than we are.
[00:46:04.434 --> 00:46:12.980]  The Fed had to come up with a set of metrics that said, oh, we really are more productive to justify Alan Greenspan's low interest rates and high growth assumptions.
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:16.783]  When he was with the Federal Reserve, he had one set of opinions.
[00:46:16.943 --> 00:46:26.829]  When he left the Federal Reserve, he's still my close friend, he is so much, he's so much come more my way and your way and the reality of what's happening out there.
[00:46:26.909 --> 00:46:30.332]  And, you know, you're inside looking out and you tow the company line.
[00:46:30.713 --> 00:46:33.464]  But a smart guy and I like him a lot.
[00:46:33.545 --> 00:46:35.553]  And I especially like him since he's now on our side.
[00:46:36.513 --> 00:46:37.753]  Well, there's the Wall Street Journal.
[00:46:37.773 --> 00:46:40.094]  A Fed insider calls for reform.
[00:46:40.655 --> 00:46:46.277]  Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, believes there's too much power concentrated in the New York Fed.
[00:46:46.297 --> 00:46:49.018]  I mean, that's an amazing statement from this year.
[00:46:49.798 --> 00:46:53.059]  In fact, ladies and gentlemen, that's today, February 11th.
[00:46:53.099 --> 00:47:03.043]  So, I mean, there's a major fissure in the power structure because a lot of these bankers, they like the power to issue unlimited currency and to control that.
[00:47:04.045 --> 00:47:18.409]  But when it's done to bring in a world government that's parenthetically against a free society, I think this New World Order has gotten so mature now that people on the inside are being forced to make a choice which side they're going to be on.
[00:47:18.609 --> 00:47:23.311]  Can you give us any intel from your sources about how serious the infighting is in the Federal Reserve?
[00:47:24.311 --> 00:47:24.711]  I can't.
[00:47:24.771 --> 00:47:29.312]  That I don't get into because a lot of the folks I know inside wouldn't comment.
[00:47:29.592 --> 00:47:32.813]  My folks on the outside don't have a good perspective.
[00:47:32.833 --> 00:47:35.854]  But keep in mind, people's positions change all the time.
[00:47:35.914 --> 00:47:37.474]  Dick Fisher's position changes.
[00:47:37.934 --> 00:47:39.294]  Dudley's position changes.
[00:47:39.654 --> 00:47:43.115]  They all fit into a story that looks current.
[00:47:43.135 --> 00:47:45.256]  And there's some dissension, but the dissension rotates.
[00:47:45.296 --> 00:47:46.196]  Sometimes they're positive.
[00:47:46.616 --> 00:47:47.417]  Sometimes they're negative.
[00:47:47.477 --> 00:47:55.521]  I will say this, when you've talked about this a lot on your show, the key to this world working right this very minute is the strength of the U.S.
[00:47:55.541 --> 00:47:55.862]  dollar.
[00:47:56.242 --> 00:47:59.784]  Not that I think it should be stronger or weaker, but think about this.
[00:48:00.364 --> 00:48:00.965]  The U.S.
[00:48:01.005 --> 00:48:01.845]  has a printing press.
[00:48:02.225 --> 00:48:02.686]  The U.S.
[00:48:02.726 --> 00:48:05.727]  can do whatever it wants to with world reserve currency.
[00:48:06.128 --> 00:48:06.528]  The U.S.
[00:48:06.548 --> 00:48:09.570]  has gone to war every time the dollar has been threatened.
[00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:11.631]  We can just pick the latest three.
[00:48:11.711 --> 00:48:13.332]  We have Iran, Iraq, and Libya.
[00:48:13.672 --> 00:48:17.854]  They all threaten to create a gold-backed dinar, a gold-backed currency.
[00:48:18.674 --> 00:48:21.616]  Anybody that creates a gold-backed currency is going to pose a threat to the United States.
[00:48:21.636 --> 00:48:29.700]  And now the Russians are trying to create their own system based on petrol bricks or something, and so that's why we're starting a war with Russia.
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:34.562]  Well, BRICS is Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.
[00:48:34.862 --> 00:48:37.383]  It's a coalition of those countries.
[00:48:37.743 --> 00:48:40.644]  And now they've added many, many more countries to the coalition.
[00:48:40.664 --> 00:48:47.587]  The whole purpose of BRICS was to trade among themselves and not have to use dollars, not have to convert to dollars first.
[00:48:48.007 --> 00:48:48.847]  It's very effective.
[00:48:48.867 --> 00:48:52.228]  And the number of countries, Canada is involved in this.
[00:48:52.528 --> 00:48:53.809]  Mexico's involved in this.
[00:48:54.509 --> 00:48:58.372]  As the dollar becomes less important in the world markets, the U.S.'
[00:48:58.272 --> 00:49:01.214]  's significance becomes less important.
[00:49:01.514 --> 00:49:02.594]  And that's what everybody wants.
[00:49:02.674 --> 00:49:04.296]  Everybody around the world wants the U.S.
[00:49:04.396 --> 00:49:05.636]  weakened, but not dead.
[00:49:05.997 --> 00:49:11.820]  They want us to still consume, but they don't want us to be a blockade to their political strategies.
[00:49:12.081 --> 00:49:16.443]  They just want us weakened, and I think the currency is the way that they will do it.
[00:49:17.284 --> 00:49:19.187]  Sure, and the globalists are playing both sides.
[00:49:19.227 --> 00:49:24.935]  They're heavily invested in BRICS and want to segue into that with a China-centered world system.
[00:49:25.215 --> 00:49:31.884]  But China is so fundamentally weak, when you look at their real numbers, that it just seems like a crazy plan they've cooked up.
[00:49:31.904 --> 00:49:32.685]  I don't see it working.
[00:49:33.126 --> 00:49:36.468]  Well, and I've had a lot of close friends in finance that say the same thing.
[00:49:36.708 --> 00:49:38.669]  But think about China and Russia together.
[00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:40.130]  You know, normally they're mortal enemies.
[00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:42.411]  They're not mortal enemies right now.
[00:49:42.751 --> 00:49:43.652]  Russia has oil.
[00:49:43.792 --> 00:49:46.013]  China has production capacity.
[00:49:46.033 --> 00:49:46.613]  They have gold.
[00:49:46.973 --> 00:49:49.114]  Admittedly, both those economies are very weak.
[00:49:49.475 --> 00:49:52.616]  But, truth be told, the United States economy is weak.
[00:49:53.077 --> 00:49:56.959]  And we're strapped with $18 trillion worth of debt that Russia doesn't have.
[00:49:56.979 --> 00:49:58.679]  So, I mean, everything balances out.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.341]  But Russia and China have created, through BRICS,
[00:50:01.661 --> 00:50:03.562]  They've created their own federal reserve system.
[00:50:03.902 --> 00:50:12.066]  They've created their own SWIFT system, which is what we use to clear money in essentially Western world finance.
[00:50:12.306 --> 00:50:16.868]  They've created their own system, which is parallel to everything in the West, just so they can't
[00:50:17.008 --> 00:50:19.211]  They don't have to be intimidated by the United States.
[00:50:19.231 --> 00:50:19.631]  Sure, sure.
[00:50:19.671 --> 00:50:35.130]  I mean, I don't romanticize the Russians and people, but the establishment running the United States and Europe has abused the dollar hegemony and has really done some dangerous things and is forcing the world to try to build a life raft because it's so scary what's happening.
[00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:36.552]  I mean, I think that's what's really going on.
[00:50:37.168 --> 00:50:51.676]  Yeah, and once you get countries, think of this, once you get countries trading between themselves, let's say Brazil and India have commodities to trade, what in the world should make them convert to dollars first without trading directly the commodities?
[00:50:51.716 --> 00:50:57.699]  And if they trade a commodity for a currency, why shouldn't they trade for the Brazilian real?
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:50:58.300]  Exactly.
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:50:59.961]  Stay there, Mr. Kofal.
[00:51:00.621 --> 00:51:01.583]  Think about that, folks.
[00:51:02.043 --> 00:51:06.971]  The West is doing things that are going to kill the dollar, but if you try to leave it, then they attack you.
[00:51:07.451 --> 00:51:08.213]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:51:09.557 --> 00:51:10.898]  Attention Alex Jones listeners.
[00:51:11.038 --> 00:51:19.221]  When you're on the road or have limited data or Wi-Fi, now you can listen to Alex Jones unfiltered and untapped at no extra charge on this non-federal phone number.
[00:51:19.241 --> 00:51:19.861]  1-605-562-5136.
[00:51:20.361 --> 00:51:24.963]  Try it now to listen to Alex Jones 24-7 at no extra cost or data charges.
[00:51:25.083 --> 00:51:26.343]  These are not on federal lines.
[00:51:26.523 --> 00:51:29.044]  These are lines located on Indian reservations off the grid.
[00:51:29.164 --> 00:51:30.345]  Call 1-605-562-5136.
[00:51:32.145 --> 00:51:33.586]  No smartphones or internet needed.
[00:51:33.726 --> 00:51:36.287]  To hear Alex Jones untapped and off the grid, just call 1-605-562-5136.
[00:51:39.668 --> 00:51:40.228]  Hear that?
[00:51:40.869 --> 00:51:45.170]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:51:46.251 --> 00:51:48.532]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:51:49.012 --> 00:51:52.313]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[00:51:52.613 --> 00:51:59.796]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[00:52:00.177 --> 00:52:04.578]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[00:52:04.778 --> 00:52:06.759]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[00:52:07.219 --> 00:52:07.640]  Faketv.com
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.323]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:11.603 --> 00:52:16.469]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:16.729 --> 00:52:24.558]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed, and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:24.838 --> 00:52:29.143]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:29.363 --> 00:52:33.188]  By Patriots Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:33.348 --> 00:52:39.054]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:39.295 --> 00:52:39.735]  It is rare to
[00:52:39.735 --> 00:52:40.335]  We're good to go.
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:13.684]  It's unbelievable that an herbal formula can work so fast and so powerfully!
[00:53:37.978 --> 00:53:38.799]  This is an alert.
[00:53:39.079 --> 00:53:43.042]  If your business or church is building this year, you're about to pay more than you should.
[00:53:43.162 --> 00:53:47.244]  This could mean thousands of dollars more for your office, retail space, church, or warehouse.
[00:53:47.384 --> 00:53:52.668]  A General Steel building can save you as much as half the cost and time of similar conventional construction.
[00:53:52.768 --> 00:53:56.190]  And we're offering rebates of up to $20,000 to help you build today.
[00:53:56.290 --> 00:53:59.333]  Call General Steel for free information that could save you thousands.
[00:53:59.513 --> 00:53:59.933]  Call 866-91-STEEL.
[00:53:59.953 --> 00:54:00.213]  866-91-STEEL.
[00:54:00.233 --> 00:54:00.553]  That's 866-917-8335.
[00:54:30.092 --> 00:54:34.453]  DanCofall.com is his website.
[00:54:34.493 --> 00:54:36.894]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:54:36.914 --> 00:54:40.014]  And he's got a show out of Dallas here at GCN.
[00:54:40.234 --> 00:54:43.235]  The network that carries my broadcast is going to work with him on The Syndicate.
[00:54:43.275 --> 00:54:43.895]  So that's exciting.
[00:54:43.915 --> 00:54:44.636]  He's got a great show.
[00:54:44.976 --> 00:54:46.076]  DanCofall.com.
[00:54:46.136 --> 00:54:47.957]  He'll be with us in the rest of this short segment.
[00:54:48.337 --> 00:54:49.057]  The next segment...
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:54.701]  And then we are going to go into the second hour.
[00:54:54.721 --> 00:54:57.042]  I'm going to cover news and open the phones up.
[00:54:57.082 --> 00:55:02.603]  Then Vani Hari is going to be joining us, the food babe, for 30 minutes at the start of the third hour.
[00:55:03.043 --> 00:55:08.445]  And then Joe Biggs will be joining us on the Ukraine situation and more coming up.
[00:55:09.105 --> 00:55:11.486]  in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today.
[00:55:11.886 --> 00:55:19.290]  Then, InfoWars Nightly News, of course, premieres every night, 7 o'clock Central, weeknights, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:55:19.730 --> 00:55:23.392]  If you're not a member of PrisonPlanet.tv, I gotta say, why not?
[00:55:23.412 --> 00:55:25.253]  20 people can use the same membership.
[00:55:25.593 --> 00:55:26.734]  It's $5.95 a month.

[00:55:41.665 --> 00:55:42.005]  $5.95 a month.
[00:55:42.165 --> 00:55:43.586]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:55:43.606 --> 00:55:45.668]  Sign up for a year and it's even less money.
[00:55:45.688 --> 00:55:49.151]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:55:49.171 --> 00:55:53.834]  It's just like voting for organic food or voting for local produce.
[00:55:53.854 --> 00:55:56.336]  You vote with your dollars and word of mouth.
[00:55:56.356 --> 00:55:57.778]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:55:58.198 --> 00:56:00.500]  We are running several specials.
[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:05.844]  We've got a human empowerment special running in the month of February for Valentine's.
[00:56:06.344 --> 00:56:08.466]  And that's super male and super female vitality.
[00:56:08.526 --> 00:56:10.368]  Just concentrated organic herbs.
[00:56:10.928 --> 00:56:12.428]  That will knock your socks off.
[00:56:12.468 --> 00:56:14.449]  I mean, I take it every single day.
[00:56:14.989 --> 00:56:15.950]  It truly is amazing.
[00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:21.791]  We've got 20% off the already discounted high-quality product at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:56:22.231 --> 00:56:32.975]  We also have a free bottle of Herbal Defense, Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Booster that's so key during this time of the year when you get it with two bottles of the Super Nascent Iodine X2.

[00:56:35.996 --> 00:56:36.096]  Dan,
[00:56:40.837 --> 00:56:59.030]  Briefly looking at this, how can the people running the West devalue the dollar, do all this to other people's currencies, and then get mad at them when they start devaluing their currencies, and then if someone tries to create an alternative system, then they get militarily or economically attacked?
[00:56:59.450 --> 00:57:04.614]  I mean, it really is a sinister program of arrogance I see coming out of the West.
[00:57:04.894 --> 00:57:06.275]  Do you think it'll go on forever?
[00:57:07.194 --> 00:57:08.155]  Nothing can go on forever.
[00:57:08.435 --> 00:57:11.237]  But I do agree with what you just said completely.
[00:57:11.537 --> 00:57:17.161]  When we call the Chinese currency manipulators, what the heck do you call the Federal Reserve?
[00:57:17.221 --> 00:57:18.362]  What do you call the U.S.
[00:57:18.402 --> 00:57:18.862]  Treasury?
[00:57:20.063 --> 00:57:22.305]  What do you call them if they're not currency manipulators?
[00:57:22.345 --> 00:57:22.985]  Of course they are!
[00:57:23.346 --> 00:57:25.887]  And every country has the right to manipulate their own currency.
[00:57:25.947 --> 00:57:28.849]  Every country has the right to change their own trade policies.
[00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:29.490]  But the U.S.
[00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:32.472]  doesn't like it when it affects the dollar.
[00:57:32.572 --> 00:57:33.633]  Any challenge to the dollar
[00:57:34.013 --> 00:57:36.294]  We'll bring out the threats of war.
[00:57:36.314 --> 00:57:39.656]  Remember when Obama said he was going to pivot to Southeast Asia?
[00:57:39.996 --> 00:57:45.659]  Well, he did pivot to Southeast Asia because of China and Russia's and the BRICS alliance.
[00:57:45.939 --> 00:57:50.042]  You've also got Russia and Ukraine having an issue.
[00:57:50.222 --> 00:57:53.704]  One reason the US is in Ukraine is to fight back against Russia.
[00:57:54.004 --> 00:57:56.005]  The US can't let Russia and China
[00:57:57.086 --> 00:58:02.792]  Get a toehold with establishing their own BRICS currency or their own financial systems.
[00:58:03.092 --> 00:58:05.275]  That would be such a huge challenge to the dollar.
[00:58:05.755 --> 00:58:08.659]  The dollar would be effectively finita.
[00:58:10.046 --> 00:58:14.549]  But this bullying is still forcing them to move forward with that.
[00:58:14.569 --> 00:58:15.910]  So it seems almost inevitable.
[00:58:16.171 --> 00:58:23.716]  Instead of just trading with Russia, trading with China like Ron Paul says, and really being the good guys, I think we lose the moral authority to play on these games.
[00:58:23.736 --> 00:58:25.557]  I have no doubt about it.
[00:58:25.657 --> 00:58:27.139]  And it concerns me a lot.
[00:58:27.859 --> 00:58:29.300]  I used to be a Republican.
[00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:33.022]  I used to have all these strong thoughts, much like you did, about the United States.
[00:58:33.582 --> 00:58:35.684]  Now I'm not a Republican.
[00:58:35.704 --> 00:58:36.384]  I'm not a Democrat.
[00:58:36.424 --> 00:58:37.164]  I'm not anything.
[00:58:37.485 --> 00:58:39.446]  And I'm as conservative as they come.
[00:58:39.486 --> 00:58:46.170]  And I'm extremely concerned what our country must look like to other countries around the world.
[00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:46.670]  Dan, stay there.
[00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:52.733]  I want to come back in 70 seconds and have you finish up and talk about our government working with Islamic extremists against Russia as well.
[00:58:54.515 --> 00:58:55.615]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:59.437 --> 00:59:02.459]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[00:59:02.799 --> 00:59:06.081]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[00:59:06.322 --> 00:59:12.306]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[00:59:12.406 --> 00:59:13.566]  I'm all about human potential.
[00:59:13.787 --> 00:59:15.948]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[00:59:16.008 --> 00:59:17.529]  The establishment is the opposite.
[00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:22.112]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[00:59:22.372 --> 00:59:26.735]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[00:59:26.975 --> 00:59:29.257]  How we can come together and win the human race.
[00:59:29.537 --> 00:59:29.977]  We're good.
[01:00:01.972 --> 01:00:04.580]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:19.776]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:20.436 --> 01:00:21.237]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.017 --> 01:00:22.938]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.559 --> 01:00:27.182]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.762 --> 01:00:31.826]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:36.556 --> 01:00:42.258]  Dan Cofall, radio host out of Dallas, about to be syndicated via GCNlive.com, is our guest.
[01:00:42.318 --> 01:00:43.398]  I've been ranting here.
[01:00:43.759 --> 01:00:45.799]  You've got the last five minutes, you've got the floor.
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:49.441]  What do you think about what's happening with the EU, with Greece?
[01:00:50.341 --> 01:00:53.082]  I mean, just, what's the next big shoe to drop?
[01:00:53.834 --> 01:01:01.759]  Well, the reason that Greece is such a problem is not that it's such a huge economy, but the EU is not designed to have countries come and go from it.
[01:01:02.179 --> 01:01:09.244]  The Greeks are really saying to hell with you, excuse me, to heck with you, about your debt and your austerity.
[01:01:09.284 --> 01:01:11.025]  We don't plan to honor the debt.
[01:01:11.045 --> 01:01:20.211]  Well, the problem is, once Greece says we're not going to honor the debt, then Italy says the same thing, then Spain says the same thing, and now you have this cascading effect.
[01:01:20.231 --> 01:01:21.411]  Then Portugal, then Ireland.
[01:01:21.752 --> 01:01:21.972]  That's it.
[01:01:23.097 --> 01:01:25.410]  And the Germans aren't going to sit there and put up with this forever.
[01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:35.038]  No, and the Euro, as we know it, will diminish in significance, which is kind of good for the U.S., but that's the reason that the Greeks are so important.
[01:01:35.458 --> 01:01:38.419]  And this new Greek government, they call themselves leftists.
[01:01:38.519 --> 01:01:46.702]  They look a lot like people from the right years ago, saying we're not going to put up with this forced austerity because it's not in our best interest.
[01:01:47.262 --> 01:01:51.964]  Even if the Federal Reserve puts up the money for the Greeks, people will find that out.
[01:01:52.004 --> 01:01:54.905]  They'll know, and they can't continue to back Greece forever.
[01:01:55.205 --> 01:02:00.967]  So this is a real, no kidding problem that can and probably will cascade through.
[01:02:00.987 --> 01:02:03.788]  And the problem is, real quick on the derivatives.
[01:02:04.129 --> 01:02:08.490]  The derivatives are so dangerous and so damaging, there's not a nickel behind those derivatives.
[01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:17.874]  It's like you going to a crap table in Las Vegas and saying, I want to put $50 on a hard 8, but you don't put any money down.
[01:02:18.294 --> 01:02:20.275]  Well, that's what derivatives are like.
[01:02:20.295 --> 01:02:22.796]  You're making bets without any equity behind the bets.
[01:02:23.396 --> 01:02:25.777]  The only equity is the faith and credit of the United States, i.e.
[01:02:26.157 --> 01:02:26.778]  the taxpayer.
[01:02:27.098 --> 01:02:30.919]  Westin, you've been right for a long time when it says that the U.S.
[01:02:30.939 --> 01:02:34.881]  has now agreed to back $700 billion worth of derivatives.
[01:02:34.901 --> 01:02:40.323]  When you first said that, I had to spend some time researching that to figure out where you got that from.
[01:02:40.403 --> 01:02:52.969]  And then I saw the introduction of the language in that bill that said that financial institutions can now invest from their banks, which are guaranteed by the FBI.
[01:02:53.929 --> 01:03:07.174]  Well, I was just going off what a bunch of financial experts who were reading the bill said, so I was just going off.
[01:03:07.494 --> 01:03:10.235]  I could go to the subsection of the bill and see they were doing that.
[01:03:10.275 --> 01:03:15.697]  I mean, look at how Obama now wants to take over the education IRAs to protect them and tax them.
[01:03:16.337 --> 01:03:18.818]  I mean, if we let them do that, they're going to go after everything.
[01:03:18.858 --> 01:03:19.398]  That's the plan.
[01:03:19.898 --> 01:03:20.838]  Absolutely.
[01:03:20.878 --> 01:03:22.259]  401Ks, IRAs.
[01:03:23.519 --> 01:03:35.143]  It's been in Congress since about 2005 when Democrats first started to make it known that we're not worried about the debt because it's just coincidental that there happens to be just about the same size of the U.S.
[01:03:35.183 --> 01:03:38.164]  debt, roughly, right now, $19 trillion.
[01:03:38.464 --> 01:03:43.205]  There happens to be roughly $20 trillion in 401Ks and IRAs.
[01:03:43.566 --> 01:03:44.846]  What a wonderful coincidence.
[01:03:45.106 --> 01:03:49.589]  Which is the only place you can keep a little bit of after-tax money and maybe have a retirement.
[01:03:49.809 --> 01:04:00.815]  They're going to rob the very baby boomers and people that are putting them in power while the Democrats constantly claim that it's conservatives that want to loot Social Security when they want to loot the private Social Security.
[01:04:01.235 --> 01:04:05.559]  Well, I'm just shocked that you'd use the phrase rob, because they're not going to rob you, Alex.
[01:04:05.579 --> 01:04:19.150]  They're going to take everything you've got, and then they're going to turn right around and give you a piece of paper that says, hold this piece of paper for 30 years, we'll pay you 3% interest, and hopefully you'll get your money back, because it's backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.
[01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:26.576]  They're going to give you that piece of paper back, even after they've taken all of your assets, all of your hard assets, all of your paper assets.
[01:04:27.156 --> 01:04:30.700]  You know, I'm trying to be a little humorous there, but yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:31.781]  They're robbing America.
[01:04:31.901 --> 01:04:40.711]  Well, Dan, I'd like to invite you down sometime when I'm out of town to co-host with David Knight or some of the other crew, and I really appreciate you being on with us.
[01:04:40.731 --> 01:04:41.512]  Thank you so much.
[01:04:42.113 --> 01:04:42.833]  I enjoyed it, Alex.
[01:04:42.933 --> 01:04:44.654]  I've listened to you for years.
[01:04:44.754 --> 01:04:46.375]  You're just a pleasure to listen to.
[01:04:46.395 --> 01:04:47.195]  Oh, please stop it.
[01:04:47.235 --> 01:04:48.335]  You're a pleasure to listen to.
[01:04:48.375 --> 01:04:48.916]  You're awesome.
[01:04:49.456 --> 01:04:50.176]  All right, folks.
[01:04:50.196 --> 01:04:51.617]  That's it with Dan Cofall.
[01:04:51.957 --> 01:04:55.098]  We've got a link to his website up on Infowars.com.
[01:04:55.538 --> 01:04:56.799]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:56.859 --> 01:05:00.320]  On the other side, I'm going to give the number out, Cover News, and take your calls.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.200]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:05.302]  Never forget, if you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:05:09.369 --> 01:05:16.312]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[01:07:08.905 --> 01:07:11.967]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[01:07:12.307 --> 01:07:15.569]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:21.794]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[01:07:21.894 --> 01:07:23.054]  I'm all about human potential.
[01:07:23.275 --> 01:07:25.436]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[01:07:25.496 --> 01:07:26.997]  The establishment is the opposite.
[01:07:27.077 --> 01:07:31.600]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:36.223]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[01:07:36.463 --> 01:07:38.745]  How we can come together and win the human race.
[01:07:39.245 --> 01:07:40.026]  We're good to go.
[01:08:09.741 --> 01:08:15.484]  This is the most transparent administration in history, and I can document how that is the case.
[01:08:16.064 --> 01:08:19.105]  American journalists at a media event have criticized the U.S.
[01:08:19.205 --> 01:08:21.947]  administration over transparency issues.
[01:08:22.287 --> 01:08:24.868]  We cover what we are allowed to cover.
[01:08:25.088 --> 01:08:27.389]  Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.
[01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:33.512]  Information management has become so sophisticated, every administration learns from the previous.
[01:08:33.912 --> 01:08:34.753]  I've got a pen.
[01:08:35.633 --> 01:08:36.254]  And I've got a phone.
[01:08:36.594 --> 01:08:39.597]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as President.
[01:08:39.757 --> 01:08:44.300]  What do you say to someone who believes the President took action to change the law?
[01:08:44.741 --> 01:08:45.722]  We did not change the law.
[01:08:45.902 --> 01:08:46.803]  We acted within the law.
[01:08:47.123 --> 01:08:52.888]  What you're not paying attention to is the fact that I just took an action to change the law.
[01:09:18.223 --> 01:09:23.426]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:09:28.351 --> 01:09:42.077]  Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means basically that there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[01:09:43.478 --> 01:09:51.982]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else
[01:09:53.082 --> 01:09:55.363]  In the Fed, ladies and gentlemen, talk about breaking the law.
[01:09:55.403 --> 01:09:57.004]  Well, what if you say that you're above the law?
[01:09:57.724 --> 01:10:00.926]  And that Congress just has nothing to say?
[01:10:17.403 --> 01:10:22.988]  Period, on the power of the purse, which in the Constitution is the main power of the Congress, the purse strings.
[01:10:23.588 --> 01:10:35.738]  Elizabeth Warren, who the Democrats praise as this pure as the driven snow, super Hillary who will defeat the big mega banks and redistribute the wealth and save us all, a la the Davos plan.
[01:10:36.438 --> 01:10:41.322]  Elizabeth Warren opposes congressional meddling, close quote, of Audit the Fed bill.
[01:10:41.643 --> 01:10:44.085]  It would appear the powers that be are getting nervous.
[01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:45.640]  That's right.
[01:10:45.980 --> 01:11:02.780]  Yesterday, Fed Governor Jerome Powell stepped up to the central bank's push against the term congressional efforts to extend political influence over monetary policy, calling them misguided and in violent conflict with the facts.
[01:11:04.261 --> 01:11:18.677]  Today we have Elizabeth Warren, the senator, trying to sound supportive of transparency, but proclaiming that she opposes Rand Paul's audit of the Fed bill because it promotes congressional meddling in the Fed's monetary policy decisions.
[01:11:19.037 --> 01:11:22.541]  The Fed's monetary policy decisions.
[01:11:25.546 --> 01:11:32.529]  Desperate to appear a huge opponent of Wall Street and the Fed, Warren begins, as Bloomberg reports, by criticizing it.
[01:11:32.890 --> 01:11:38.112]  That she strongly supports greater congressional oversight over the Fed's regulatory and supervisory responsibilities.
[01:11:38.733 --> 01:11:42.374]  Then, retraces and hinders the efforts to bring transparency.
[01:11:42.775 --> 01:11:49.498]  Warren, quote, opposes current versions of the Fed audit legislation because it promotes congressional meddling.
[01:11:50.643 --> 01:11:55.607]  She goes on to say there's dangerous implications for financial stability and the health of the global economy.
[01:11:55.627 --> 01:11:58.690]  This is from someone who supported the Obamacare Act.
[01:12:17.691 --> 01:12:31.990]  The Affordable Care Screwjob Act that at least doubles your prices, creates giant death panels, and they admit is a transfer of wealth, but thank God the American people are so stupid to quote Gruber because they wrote it to confuse the public.
[01:12:35.458 --> 01:12:41.103]  And the case for killing Granny, one week after they passed Obamacare, Newsweek came out and said, yeah, we're going to kill your grandmother.
[01:12:41.564 --> 01:12:41.964]  Guess what?
[01:12:41.984 --> 01:12:42.945]  It was in there, suckers.
[01:12:43.345 --> 01:12:44.627]  And Zuckerberg says the same thing.
[01:12:44.867 --> 01:12:46.729]  You know, my users are dumb effers.
[01:12:47.349 --> 01:12:48.110]  Quote, close quote.
[01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:49.651]  They think they can trust us.
[01:12:51.393 --> 01:12:53.755]  See, it's the reveling in the slavery.
[01:12:55.157 --> 01:12:56.618]  Just like Brian Williams is up there.
[01:12:56.678 --> 01:12:59.441]  Oh yeah, I got shot down by an RPG in a helicopter.
[01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:01.750]  Oh, I meant, I was flying right behind it.
[01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:04.871]  Oh, I meant, uh, uh, blue blood, hour and a half before.
[01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:07.232]  I saw dead bodies all over the place floating by.
[01:13:07.672 --> 01:13:09.853]  Katrina, I was there, uh, not true.
[01:13:11.794 --> 01:13:14.035]  Lies, lies, lies.
[01:13:14.695 --> 01:13:15.495]  Lies, lies.
[01:13:15.515 --> 01:13:18.196]  In fact, can we cue some ministry up for the intro of the next segment?
[01:13:18.857 --> 01:13:19.677]  The, uh, lie song?
[01:13:23.424 --> 01:13:24.385]  Because this is lies.
[01:13:24.945 --> 01:13:34.575]  And so I want to ask the listeners, where do we start or stop if Brian Williams thought about doing a skit
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:46.005]  Everybody's making jokes, you know, Obama said you didn't build that, so everybody made these memes of kids building blocks, or people cutting their yard, or somebody, you know, writing a book.
[01:13:46.386 --> 01:13:47.066]  You didn't do that!
[01:13:47.106 --> 01:13:47.827]  You didn't build that!
[01:13:48.227 --> 01:13:54.731]  Well, now they're putting out all these different memes, uh, that Brian Williams was with the 300, uh, at Gallipoli.
[01:13:54.751 --> 01:13:59.535]  Uh, Brian Williams actually wrote the speech for Martin Luther King, in fact he was Martin Luther King.
[01:13:59.555 --> 01:14:02.917]  Uh, and uh, continuing, uh, he's
[01:14:05.868 --> 01:14:11.931]  Was actually there with Babe Ruth whenever he knocked all those balls out of the park.
[01:14:13.793 --> 01:14:14.433]  He did everything.
[01:14:16.474 --> 01:14:24.899]  And because this has now happened, he's been exposed, it is endangering Hillary because she pulled the exact same type of scam.
[01:14:28.123 --> 01:14:32.385]  So there we were at this bridge, and Frodo says to me, here, you take the ring.
[01:14:32.745 --> 01:14:34.605]  He also has the ring of power.
[01:14:34.785 --> 01:14:37.767]  Of course, if he mentions that at a public school, he'll be kicked out of school or arrested.
[01:14:39.127 --> 01:14:42.068]  Brian Williams also said it was an honor to be the first man to walk on the moon.
[01:14:42.108 --> 01:14:43.709]  It wasn't Neil Armstrong.
[01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:49.511]  He won his fifth Wimbledon championship.
[01:14:49.591 --> 01:14:51.472]  I figured it was time to give someone else a chance.
[01:14:52.072 --> 01:14:52.712]  Brian Williams.
[01:14:53.812 --> 01:14:55.053]  He was also Mary Lou Retton.
[01:14:58.338 --> 01:15:01.039]  President Lincoln had him as a top general.
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:17.066]  But see, everybody's making jokes about this, that he survived the Titanic, and that he was there at the Last Supper, and that he's the man that stood in front of the tanks in Tiananmen Square, and that, well, he also was Ernie to Bert.
[01:15:18.766 --> 01:15:24.691]  And then he walked ashore, of course, with General MacArthur in the Philippines when he said, I shall return.
[01:15:25.391 --> 01:15:29.434]  And he was the American sniper, most deadly sniper ever as well.
[01:15:29.454 --> 01:15:32.157]  Of course, that'd be someone copying another poser.
[01:15:32.957 --> 01:15:37.641]  One does not simply misremember being shot down by an RPG in Iraq.
[01:15:41.909 --> 01:15:42.689]  That's really funny.
[01:15:43.169 --> 01:15:50.311]  There's a graphic cartoon where he's talking to Hillary Clinton in a bar, Brian Williams is, and he says, see this scar?
[01:15:50.691 --> 01:15:55.712]  Got that in Iraq when my copter was shot down by an imaginary rocket.
[01:15:56.932 --> 01:16:05.834]  And then Hillary points at her face that's seen more skirt than a toilet seat and says, that's nothing!
[01:16:05.954 --> 01:16:06.514]  I almost
[01:16:08.228 --> 01:16:15.612]  Lost the pleat in my pantsuit while dodging imaginary sniper fire in Bosnia.
[01:16:17.953 --> 01:16:29.380]  Hey, how are they going to square that with Hillary, that Bill got in trouble for cheating on her with women, and that Hillary admittedly has more girlfriends than Errol Flynn?
[01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:33.302]  I mean, I'm not attacking Hillary that she thinks women are beautiful.
[01:16:33.442 --> 01:16:34.543]  I think they're beautiful as well.
[01:16:35.463 --> 01:16:36.784]  I'm just wondering, you know,
[01:16:37.574 --> 01:16:40.216]  That, uh, is she going to have a first lady in the White House?
[01:16:40.236 --> 01:16:42.577]  Because the word is, her and Clinton may get divorced.
[01:16:45.419 --> 01:16:49.281]  I mean, it doesn't matter if she's a criminal, as long as she's a lesbian, that's trendy, right?
[01:16:50.762 --> 01:16:55.745]  I mean, will the fact that Hillary is a lesbian have any bearing in the 2016 elections?
[01:16:55.966 --> 01:16:56.566]  I'm just wondering.
[01:16:56.966 --> 01:16:58.267]  I'm just throwing that out there as well.
[01:17:01.749 --> 01:17:04.271]  This is what this country has come to, an absolute joke.
[01:17:05.708 --> 01:17:07.490]  And these are the people starting war with Russia.
[01:17:07.770 --> 01:17:09.692]  Remember that FBI agent we had him on many times?
[01:17:09.712 --> 01:17:10.793]  I forget his name.
[01:17:10.813 --> 01:17:16.819]  Google the FBI agent that released the photos of the crack pipes and Mao Zedong ornaments on the Christmas tree.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.942]  And he had like a, I think it was called the Paul Revere Society.
[01:17:20.483 --> 01:17:22.605]  And they audited and tried to shut it down in D.C.
[01:17:22.725 --> 01:17:23.185]  I've had him on.
[01:17:23.205 --> 01:17:24.106]  We need to get him back on.
[01:17:25.708 --> 01:17:26.829]  He released that stuff like in 97.
[01:17:27.009 --> 01:17:28.511]  I had him on the show.
[01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:32.021]  And he got in trouble for, you know, daring to expose it.
[01:17:32.521 --> 01:17:34.423]  Who would just... You run the White House.
[01:17:34.443 --> 01:17:35.583]  You've taken the country over.
[01:17:36.524 --> 01:17:41.327]  Why would you want to hang up crack pipes and Mao Tse Tung stuff on the Christmas tree?
[01:17:42.731 --> 01:17:44.672]  It's because they're deviants, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:45.072 --> 01:17:47.253]  They're into just screwing everything over.
[01:17:47.853 --> 01:17:51.175]  Just like Gruber said, you're a bunch of idiots, aha!
[01:17:51.255 --> 01:17:53.676]  And these other globalists laugh at everybody.
[01:17:53.756 --> 01:17:56.197]  It's all part of rubbing our noses in it.
[01:17:56.697 --> 01:17:59.679]  These are weirdos that hate normal people.
[01:17:59.879 --> 01:18:02.240]  And by normal, I'm not even talking about your sexual preference.
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:04.841]  I mean, people that just don't want to run other people's lives.
[01:18:05.061 --> 01:18:06.702]  People that just like a normal Christmas tree.
[01:18:07.582 --> 01:18:10.844]  White House Christmas decor featuring Mao Zedong comes under fire.
[01:18:12.644 --> 01:18:24.809]  Yeah, that was back in 2009 because they're doing it again, but I'm talking about 1996 or 7 Who was the White House FBI agent that exposed the Clinton?
[01:18:25.469 --> 01:18:34.612]  He exposed a bunch of other weird stuff, and I just I can't remember his name right now Point is he's being properly persecuted And whatever happened to Bongino, how's he doing these days?
[01:18:35.733 --> 01:18:36.773]  We need to check in on him
[01:18:39.488 --> 01:18:43.190]  Which 90s Hillary Clinton hater will Fox host next?
[01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:49.231]  Gary Aldrich, that's right, his 1996 book about inside the White House.
[01:18:49.552 --> 01:18:53.413]  And we need to get Aldrich back on because he's getting audited and harassed by the IRS right now.
[01:18:53.713 --> 01:18:59.395]  And they admit it in Congress because he dares talk bad about our Lord and Savior, Barack Hussein Obama.
[01:18:59.455 --> 01:19:09.478]  I mean, what type of country is this where the CIA guy gets a couple years in jail for exposing illegal torture and then the people that did the torture don't get in trouble?
[01:19:10.018 --> 01:19:11.619]  The torture was advertised.
[01:19:11.659 --> 01:19:12.419]  They admitted it.
[01:19:14.005 --> 01:19:16.867]  So you can't send him to prison for exposing it.
[01:19:16.907 --> 01:19:19.890]  You can't send the guys that tortured to prison for following orders.
[01:19:19.930 --> 01:19:32.920]  I'm not saying they're innocent, but you've got to first prosecute the people that gave the illegal orders, like John Yoo, who admits he wrote the memos for the CIA saying you're authorized to bury people alive, to tear their fingernails out.
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:35.082]  People go, well good, these are Muslim extremists we're fighting.
[01:19:35.382 --> 01:19:39.085]  No, ladies and gentlemen, they're fighting anybody that resisted them.
[01:19:39.305 --> 01:19:41.387]  The actual terrorists are working for the West.
[01:19:43.334 --> 01:19:46.575]  And all we do is lose the moral high ground when you torture somebody.
[01:19:46.835 --> 01:19:53.356]  I don't care how many Jack Bauer 24s you watch, there's a reason that we'd never torture.
[01:19:55.076 --> 01:19:57.837]  You don't torture because you lose the moral high ground.
[01:19:58.677 --> 01:20:01.418]  Besides, the real way to get somebody to talk is to offer them a suitcase of cash.
[01:20:01.738 --> 01:20:02.498]  Everybody knows that.
[01:20:04.878 --> 01:20:05.699]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:05.739 --> 01:20:06.279]  Stay with us.
[01:20:06.359 --> 01:20:07.079]  InfoWars.com.
[01:20:09.754 --> 01:20:11.475]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:20:11.695 --> 01:20:15.016]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:20:15.316 --> 01:20:16.297]  A pair of scissors.
[01:20:16.677 --> 01:20:22.179]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:27.122]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[01:20:27.382 --> 01:20:28.202]  The phone line.
[01:20:28.362 --> 01:20:33.284]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:20:33.624 --> 01:20:37.366]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:20:37.526 --> 01:20:40.427]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[01:20:40.847 --> 01:20:43.088]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[01:20:43.308 --> 01:20:47.509]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[01:20:47.650 --> 01:20:48.550]  Scissors can't cut it.
[01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:50.971]  And that means your home stays safe.
[01:20:50.991 --> 01:20:54.792]  24-7 professional monitoring is under $15 a month with no contract.
[01:20:55.012 --> 01:20:58.354]  SimpliSafe home security keeps you safer than the other guys.

[01:21:09.262 --> 01:21:11.824]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:21:12.104 --> 01:21:13.885]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk.
[01:21:14.045 --> 01:21:16.947]  ...and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:21:17.207 --> 01:21:25.092]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed, and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:21:25.332 --> 01:21:29.635]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:21:29.855 --> 01:21:33.657]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:21:33.817 --> 01:21:39.521]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:21:39.761 --> 01:21:42.543]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:21:42.923 --> 01:21:48.147]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:21:48.307 --> 01:21:56.432]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[01:22:03.697 --> 01:22:04.218]  We're good to go.
[01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:11.105]  What good is a Big Berkey water filter?
[01:22:11.725 --> 01:22:14.967]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:22:15.247 --> 01:22:17.049]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[01:22:17.409 --> 01:22:26.435]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.
[01:22:26.715 --> 01:22:32.359]  Plus, Big Berkey water filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.
[01:22:32.719 --> 01:22:38.703]  Tested by multiple independent NSF EPA certified labs, they are the gold standard in water purification.
[01:22:39.063 --> 01:22:43.526]  At only 1.7 cents a gallon, a single set of filters can last for 5 to 10 years.
[01:22:43.906 --> 01:22:45.367]  That means big savings.
[01:22:45.667 --> 01:22:49.850]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[01:23:38.035 --> 01:23:42.236]  Have you ever wondered if you could make electric, light, or heat in your home for free?
[01:23:42.597 --> 01:23:43.857]  It is now a new day.
[01:23:44.197 --> 01:23:46.738]  How about a motor that charges batteries at the same time?
[01:23:47.318 --> 01:23:50.899]  What if this also restores useless batteries and saves you lots of money?
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:55.861]  Come to our Renaissance Charge Conference Workshop on March 7th and 8th in Chicago.
[01:23:56.261 --> 01:23:58.042]  Visit r-charge.com.
[01:23:58.322 --> 01:24:00.503]  That's r-charge.com for details.
[01:24:00.923 --> 01:24:01.243]  Or call 208-304-2954.
[01:24:01.263 --> 01:24:01.303]  208-304-2954.
[01:24:19.674 --> 01:24:23.855]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government.
[01:24:24.135 --> 01:24:30.037]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:24:30.938 --> 01:24:33.498]  You still think that jet fuel brought down the World Trade Center?
[01:24:35.319 --> 01:24:38.040]  Does anybody else see a problem here?
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:43.862]  If the government has nothing to hide, why are they so afraid to answer a few questions?
[01:24:44.822 --> 01:24:46.783]  This story does not add up.
[01:24:50.091 --> 01:24:50.551]  Lies.
[01:24:50.571 --> 01:24:54.253]  9-11 was a coup against our republic.
[01:24:55.754 --> 01:24:58.936]  Gentlemen, we called you here together to overthrow the United States government.
[01:25:03.018 --> 01:25:07.240]  That's why I oppose classical secession by the states.
[01:25:08.061 --> 01:25:10.202]  We're not seceding from the federal government.
[01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:15.985]  We need to secede from the occupied crime syndicate that's taken over.
[01:25:17.246 --> 01:25:19.547]  To re-upload the republic.
[01:25:21.547 --> 01:25:26.208]  It's like you come home after a month-long trip and people moved into your house, you have them thrown out.
[01:25:26.889 --> 01:25:29.429]  You throw them out, or if you don't wanna get your hands dirty, you call the police.
[01:25:31.530 --> 01:25:34.831]  And that's what we gotta do, is police our country and throw the criminals out.
[01:25:35.291 --> 01:25:39.072]  They've gotten away with so much because people can't believe the evil we're facing.
[01:25:40.753 --> 01:25:43.574]  But finally, with somebody like Brian Williams, it clicks.
[01:25:43.634 --> 01:25:45.014]  Or somebody like Gruber, it clicks.
[01:25:45.154 --> 01:25:47.675]  Wow, you're an arrogant, lying sack of garbage.
[01:25:50.868 --> 01:25:58.313]  Well, Al Gore says he invented the Internet when two different guys have won Nobel Prizes for it.
[01:25:58.473 --> 01:26:02.776]  One American, one English, for developing what became the Internet in the 1960s.
[01:26:04.677 --> 01:26:06.418]  Al Gore had nothing to do with it.
[01:26:06.458 --> 01:26:13.103]  He voted in the Senate on some legislation on Internet rules in the early 90s.
[01:26:15.933 --> 01:26:22.895]  So he could say, I was involved in legislation with standardization right before the Internet became ubiquitous.
[01:26:24.855 --> 01:26:27.296]  Instead, he says he invented the Internet.
[01:26:27.316 --> 01:26:28.176]  You can pull the clip up.
[01:26:29.196 --> 01:26:30.096]  Everybody knows he said it.
[01:26:31.516 --> 01:26:33.117]  This is the mental illness of these people.
[01:26:35.157 --> 01:26:38.278]  After all, Al Gore, I invented it and everybody knows it.
[01:26:40.481 --> 01:26:40.961]  I'm joking.
[01:26:41.321 --> 01:26:42.102]  I did not invent the internet.
[01:26:42.122 --> 01:26:44.262]  Everybody knows I didn't.
[01:26:44.362 --> 01:26:47.343]  But this Brian Williams thing is the type of issue that can bring them down.
[01:26:47.723 --> 01:26:48.544]  Here's another example.
[01:26:49.524 --> 01:26:53.325]  I can show you the Journal of Bioethics calling for killing babies up to age three.
[01:26:53.365 --> 01:26:58.167]  I can show you the legislation to put troops on death list and hold people on death list.
[01:26:59.427 --> 01:27:00.307]  It's all admitted now.
[01:27:00.848 --> 01:27:03.528]  People were in denial every step of the way it was happening.
[01:27:03.608 --> 01:27:05.169]  A feminist website had an article
[01:27:06.758 --> 01:27:10.921]  About how this woman aborted her male baby because males are inherently bad.
[01:27:11.302 --> 01:27:14.584]  And there are a lot of species where the female kills the male after mating, I guess.
[01:27:14.864 --> 01:27:16.906]  Well, now this is just kill the male before it's born.
[01:27:18.747 --> 01:27:24.412]  There are some species where males kill males under them, even their own offspring, because they don't want genetic competition.
[01:27:25.052 --> 01:27:28.335]  But this is not something we've seen in humans, and it's not healthy.
[01:27:30.171 --> 01:27:36.435]  And people are in the YouTube video from yesterday's show, the clip, Sexist Feminazi Aborts Male Baby.
[01:27:36.815 --> 01:27:39.537]  That's a good headline, but it needs to be deranged.
[01:27:40.818 --> 01:27:42.839]  Woman kills her son for feminism.
[01:27:43.759 --> 01:27:44.120]  That's it.
[01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:46.721]  Woman kills her male baby for feminism.
[01:27:47.422 --> 01:27:49.723]  Woman sacrifices male child to feminism.
[01:27:50.263 --> 01:27:55.146]  And she says she got power out of it, this is for feminism, and that women need to do more of this.
[01:27:56.567 --> 01:27:57.288]  People are
[01:27:59.221 --> 01:28:02.182]  On the website, saying this is a made up article.
[01:28:03.902 --> 01:28:06.382]  Really, is Peter Singer at Princeton saying similar things?
[01:28:06.402 --> 01:28:07.022]  Is that made up?
[01:28:07.203 --> 01:28:11.083]  Is... Is all the stuff on the news where they push this made up?
[01:28:11.163 --> 01:28:11.383]  No!
[01:28:12.003 --> 01:28:15.684]  You're in denial about how sick these people are!
[01:28:16.104 --> 01:28:17.024]  That's what's going on!
[01:28:21.085 --> 01:28:25.326]  I can play a BBC clip from last week where they're now making people in Europe get chips to have jobs.
[01:28:28.749 --> 01:28:32.453]  TSA announced last week you're gonna have to have their authorization to get a job in the future.
[01:28:33.635 --> 01:28:34.155]  Or travel.
[01:28:34.676 --> 01:28:35.537]  I mean, this is here.
[01:28:35.637 --> 01:28:36.118]  You understand?
[01:28:36.698 --> 01:28:37.479]  This is happening.
[01:28:37.519 --> 01:28:38.480]  This is planned out.
[01:28:38.981 --> 01:28:40.403]  All this stuff's going to happen.
[01:28:40.643 --> 01:28:47.050]  We're here trying to hold it back, and people are complaining, going, hadn't gotten really horrible yet, what's your problem?
[01:28:47.210 --> 01:28:48.392]  Meanwhile, it is getting horrible.
[01:28:49.718 --> 01:29:15.929]  We're trying to hold the gate up while arrows are shooting over, and rocks are being thrown on us, and we're battling as hard as we can, and there's all these slack-jawed folks going, there's no crisis, so what if 100 million people are on welfare, 50 million on food stamps, so what if there's 2 quadrillion in derivatives, so what if we're having a war with Russia, so what if we're funding Al-Qaeda, so what if they're opening the borders up and ignoring the law, so what if they shut off our power plants, so what if they carry all this out, I don't care, why don't you quit being so alarmist all day long?
[01:29:17.868 --> 01:29:18.728]  Okay, scum!
[01:29:19.008 --> 01:29:21.829]  Don't come to me when it all... Oh, you already are coming to me.
[01:29:22.209 --> 01:29:23.990]  You want government-guaranteed tuition.
[01:29:24.210 --> 01:29:25.190]  You want more welfare.
[01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:26.650]  You want more corporate welfare.
[01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:29.851]  You love the system because you've never done anything.
[01:29:31.212 --> 01:29:32.052]  I'm talking to our enemies.
[01:29:32.652 --> 01:29:35.193]  So go ahead, just know this from the... You know what?
[01:29:35.233 --> 01:29:36.273]  It's the oscillating fan.
[01:29:38.106 --> 01:29:42.967]  Those of us that know what's going on are going to be the people that stand out and the people that reconstitute society.
[01:29:43.207 --> 01:29:47.948]  And you're going to be known as the trash, garbage, scum that wrecks society.
[01:29:48.148 --> 01:29:51.568]  We're going to take your calls, 800-259-9231.
[01:29:51.888 --> 01:29:52.849]  On any of these issues, 800-259-9231.
[01:29:52.889 --> 01:29:54.489]  The phones are open!
[01:29:54.589 --> 01:29:58.610]  I'm Alex Jones, baby!
[01:29:58.890 --> 01:29:59.790]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:01.870]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.810 --> 01:30:05.491]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.451 --> 01:30:12.515]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[01:30:12.835 --> 01:30:16.119]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[01:30:16.359 --> 01:30:22.346]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[01:30:22.426 --> 01:30:23.607]  I'm all about human potential.
[01:30:23.827 --> 01:30:24.308]  I'm all about...
[01:30:24.448 --> 01:30:25.949]  The individual being empowered.
[01:30:26.029 --> 01:30:27.550]  The establishment is the opposite.
[01:30:27.610 --> 01:30:32.133]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[01:30:32.393 --> 01:30:36.756]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[01:30:36.977 --> 01:30:41.820]  How we can come together and win the human race and to celebrate the kickoff of Human Empowerment Month.

[01:31:09.666 --> 01:31:15.448]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.

[01:32:09.437 --> 01:32:12.938]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:32:13.078 --> 01:32:17.039]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:32:17.359 --> 01:32:18.819]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:32:19.139 --> 01:32:26.721]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:32:27.001 --> 01:32:27.842]  But for how long?
[01:32:28.142 --> 01:32:34.403]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:32:34.783 --> 01:32:37.584]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:32:38.956 --> 01:32:42.178]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:32:42.479 --> 01:32:50.484]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:32:50.725 --> 01:32:55.748]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:58.430]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:33:14.129 --> 01:33:15.109]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.170 --> 01:33:16.970]  Because there is a war on.
[01:33:17.070 --> 01:33:17.830]  Or you're mine.
[01:33:18.131 --> 01:33:19.971]  Even your emotions had an echo.
[01:33:19.991 --> 01:33:21.052]  So much space.
[01:33:21.072 --> 01:33:23.632]  Yeah, you gotta be crazy to know what the brother's talking about.
[01:33:50.487 --> 01:33:51.827]  Does that make me crazy?
[01:33:51.847 --> 01:33:55.348]  I think it does.
[01:33:55.368 --> 01:33:56.629]  Thank God I'm crazy.
[01:33:57.709 --> 01:34:04.111]  Because all these people going along with this tyranny, if that's normal, I don't want to be normal.
[01:34:07.213 --> 01:34:08.433]  Thank God I'm crazy.
[01:34:08.453 --> 01:34:10.974]  Let's let Narls Barkley roll a little bit more.
[01:34:19.625 --> 01:34:22.786]  That's my only advice.
[01:34:23.206 --> 01:34:26.666]  You think you're in control?
[01:34:27.206 --> 01:34:28.047]  Bless your soul.
[01:34:28.067 --> 01:34:30.107]  All you new old order people are idiots.
[01:34:48.413 --> 01:34:51.176]  If you had any connection to God, you wouldn't be doing what you're doing.
[01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:56.641]  Possibly.
[01:34:56.661 --> 01:35:01.725]  Best part of the song's right here.
[01:35:03.267 --> 01:35:04.007]  My heroes.
[01:35:04.127 --> 01:35:06.289]  So I'm gonna be like them.
[01:35:17.745 --> 01:35:19.166]  Monday through Friday, we're here live.
[01:35:19.186 --> 01:35:30.672]  I want to go to your phone calls, Stephen, Kevin, John, Mike, Steve, and others that are patiently holding, and then we'll get into a ton of other good, the bad, and the ugly news.
[01:35:30.693 --> 01:35:33.034]  A lot of good news as well, a lot of positive news.
[01:35:33.454 --> 01:35:44.941]  Watching this lying scumbag, anti-gun, pro-open border, anti-family, Obama-loving, New World Order-loving, George Bush war-loving propagandists.
[01:35:46.141 --> 01:35:54.728]  This state-loving, this tyranny-worshipping, little pretty boy garbage head, Brian Williams' fall, is a very nice sight.
[01:35:55.048 --> 01:35:59.472]  Because it could be a domino effect for people like Al Gore, Hillary Clinton, and the rest of them.
[01:36:00.753 --> 01:36:08.419]  Before I go any further, the ritual of me occasionally taking vitamins and nutraceuticals on air is not a marketing ploy.
[01:36:09.406 --> 01:36:11.048]  At least it didn't originate like that.
[01:36:11.069 --> 01:36:13.812]  It is a marketing ploy in the most sincere form.
[01:36:14.413 --> 01:36:23.607]  I tend to forget to take my InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsHealth.com nutraceuticals, whether it's Pion, Tengi, Tangerine 2.0 from InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:36:24.884 --> 01:36:43.617]  Or it's our encapsulated, organic, for the Mediterranean type, oil of oregano, that's so much more easy on the tongue and the stomach, or DNA Force, or Super Metal Vitality, or the Secret 12 Methylcobalamin, truly organic, super absorbable, Vitamin B12, or the Survival Shield X2.
[01:36:44.138 --> 01:36:45.159]  I just tend to forget.
[01:36:45.179 --> 01:36:49.722]  And I've been getting to where I take it two times a day, three times a day, and I don't forget.
[01:36:50.202 --> 01:36:52.504]  And let me tell you, when I don't forget, things are good.
[01:36:54.045 --> 01:36:58.066]  I gave my children some colloidal silver this morning, Secret 12 and Ancient Defense.
[01:36:58.106 --> 01:36:59.366]  In fact, can I have an Ancient Defense?
[01:36:59.386 --> 01:37:01.647]  I know all the bottles he put in there for display.
[01:37:01.667 --> 01:37:04.568]  I keep opening them and getting into them, and then I end up taking those home.
[01:37:05.548 --> 01:37:16.091]  But I'm kind of proud of myself, because I ran out of Secret 12 and Ancient Defense at home today, because I've been having my children, every morning, with water, take, you know, a squirt of it.
[01:37:17.351 --> 01:37:19.832]  And then I realized, wait a minute, I forgot to do it myself.
[01:37:20.372 --> 01:37:22.653]  So I have not gotten my dosages yet today.
[01:37:25.253 --> 01:37:26.013]  Got the iodine.
[01:37:26.053 --> 01:37:27.634]  This is not like the iodine at the store, folks.
[01:37:27.654 --> 01:37:28.895]  Don't do this with regular iodine.
[01:37:29.295 --> 01:37:30.155]  Consult your physician.
[01:37:30.195 --> 01:37:31.416]  This is true nascent iodine.
[01:37:32.376 --> 01:37:34.077]  Take a shot of the vitamin B12.
[01:37:34.117 --> 01:37:37.218]  Put it in the glass of filtered water.
[01:37:38.078 --> 01:37:39.259]  Super male vitality.
[01:37:39.279 --> 01:37:41.440]  I'm going to take a couple squirts of that.
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:43.440]  Oh, you're not supposed to take this much, but I'm sorry.
[01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:44.821]  I don't know.
[01:37:44.981 --> 01:37:46.562]  A little secret sauce in there.
[01:37:46.582 --> 01:37:51.304]  And then I'm going to stir this bad boy up.
[01:37:53.204 --> 01:37:54.185]  Oh, there's my ancient defense.
[01:37:55.563 --> 01:37:56.524]  I knew I was forgetting something.
[01:37:56.544 --> 01:37:58.847]  A whole bunch of key herbs to boost immunity.
[01:38:00.569 --> 01:38:01.290]  Put that in there.
[01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:07.257]  And I alternate this, but sometimes I put cloyal silver in and won't put ancient defense in.
[01:38:08.438 --> 01:38:09.639]  And then I drink a glass of this.
[01:38:09.699 --> 01:38:10.901]  And let me tell you, it's awesome.
[01:38:14.122 --> 01:38:15.003]  Actually tastes good too.
[01:38:16.144 --> 01:38:19.927]  This could be a new soda line, but all natural and good for you.
[01:38:20.027 --> 01:38:22.208]  I mean, that tastes better than vitamin water.
[01:38:22.248 --> 01:38:23.669]  That tastes better than Gatorade.
[01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:25.331]  That tastes awesome.
[01:38:25.391 --> 01:38:27.192]  I'm telling you, we need to look into that.
[01:38:27.693 --> 01:38:31.796]  Coming out with bottles that are like basically five or six ounces
[01:38:33.507 --> 01:38:39.611]  So you can get it in three or four gulps that are the true energy drink, but it's just vitamin B12 and herbs and things like that.
[01:38:39.951 --> 01:38:44.695]  I mean, believe me, if they sold this at stores, this is what I'd be buying bottled right here.
[01:38:50.339 --> 01:38:53.220]  It's the ancient defense in the vitamin B12 that makes it taste so good.
[01:38:53.581 --> 01:38:56.403]  And my kids think it's candy, because it is.
[01:38:57.896 --> 01:38:59.737]  They're in really good moods once they take it.
[01:39:00.298 --> 01:39:04.080]  So I don't give them the Super Mill Vitality, I give them everything but that.
[01:39:04.801 --> 01:39:18.451]  So again, InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com to get all the products that we produce, that you got my pledge, are the highest quality, the most concentrated.

[01:39:48.033 --> 01:39:49.293]  helps fund the operation.
[01:39:49.533 --> 01:39:51.194]  So I want to thank you all for doing that.
[01:39:52.054 --> 01:40:03.097]  Now continuing here, let me take my oil of oregano from Infowarslife.com and one of the caplets of DNA Force.
[01:40:08.599 --> 01:40:10.059]  The circle is now complete.
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:13.240]  And I will have a much better day now.
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:14.761]  So there you go.
[01:40:14.861 --> 01:40:15.681]  Please join me
[01:40:17.677 --> 01:40:21.339]  Check it out, take the challenge, and find out that it's no brag, it's just fact.
[01:40:21.639 --> 01:40:27.963]  By the grace of God, we have been able to develop truly trailblazing proprietary nutraceuticals.
[01:40:28.583 --> 01:40:31.565]  It's a win-win-win-win-win to also fund this operation.
[01:40:31.645 --> 01:40:32.685]  It's a match made in heaven.
[01:40:32.705 --> 01:40:33.406]  Thank you, Jesus.
[01:40:36.067 --> 01:40:37.328]  We just continue to be blessed.
[01:40:37.828 --> 01:40:39.629]  No weapon formed against us has prospered.
[01:40:40.069 --> 01:40:44.431]  I cannot tell you the attacks, the dirty tricks, the enemy operations against us.
[01:40:44.571 --> 01:40:48.973]  And I just have learned, I'm not confident, I've just learned to lay back and say, God, you handle it.
[01:40:49.233 --> 01:40:52.254]  And I can't believe what happens to everybody that messes with this operation.
[01:40:53.334 --> 01:40:55.455]  It is biblical, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:56.096 --> 01:40:58.257]  And I've been watching this for 20 years.
[01:40:58.277 --> 01:41:00.558]  20 years.
[01:41:02.478 --> 01:41:03.499]  I've never seen anything like it.
[01:41:04.571 --> 01:41:07.113]  George Washington talked about Providence, you name it.
[01:41:09.274 --> 01:41:14.457]  It's incredible what happens to people that do things to us, the evil demons that try to bring this operation down.
[01:41:15.258 --> 01:41:17.419]  I cannot describe what happens to people.
[01:41:22.182 --> 01:41:26.124]  Just everything they, every weapon they use against us fails.
[01:41:27.225 --> 01:41:29.946]  Everything the enemy does ends up being turned against them.
[01:41:30.026 --> 01:41:30.647]  It's amazing.
[01:41:30.967 --> 01:41:32.128]  I just want to thank God
[01:41:33.317 --> 01:41:40.262]  Right now, for the blessings this operation has had on the Hedge of Protection, as I know, I'm a dirty rat in the presence of God.
[01:41:40.382 --> 01:41:42.444]  I'm like dirty rags, the best I can offer.
[01:41:42.984 --> 01:41:44.445]  I do not deserve any of this.
[01:41:45.546 --> 01:41:52.611]  But God knows that I'm committed against evil, and that I do want justice, and I do care about innocence and the unborn, and I hate bullies.
[01:41:53.472 --> 01:41:57.534]  And so, for all my problems, I know that's why God has supported me this far.
[01:41:57.975 --> 01:41:59.156]  And, you know, it's like Job.
[01:41:59.196 --> 01:42:01.738]  If God ever removed the hedge, and I was destroyed,
[01:42:02.659 --> 01:42:04.702]  That's all just part of life.
[01:42:04.902 --> 01:42:07.085]  I would not ever blame God, and God knows that.
[01:42:08.727 --> 01:42:09.428]  God knows that.
[01:42:10.670 --> 01:42:12.051]  And so thank you all for your prayers.
[01:42:12.111 --> 01:42:14.254]  I mean, I have no doubt it's your prayers that help.
[01:42:15.123 --> 01:42:18.567]  As the Bible says, helps give us that edge of protection.
[01:42:19.548 --> 01:42:28.477]  But my life has been like a James Bond movie, and we don't get into some of the stuff that goes on, some of the things that happen, some of the things that people try on us.
[01:42:28.497 --> 01:42:29.599]  I mean, can you imagine?
[01:42:30.339 --> 01:42:33.463]  The White House-run Media Matters has articles about us every day.
[01:42:35.294 --> 01:42:37.815]  Uh, can you imagine the type of crap that goes on?
[01:42:38.476 --> 01:42:42.298]  And I've just learned that it's all part of this Matrix-like bizarreness.
[01:42:42.338 --> 01:42:47.901]  I mean, I just put up with it, uh, and quite frankly, I've just learned to take it in stride as entertaining.
[01:42:47.921 --> 01:42:49.982]  Uh, but, um...
[01:42:52.139 --> 01:42:55.203]  It truly is the promises of the good book fulfilled.
[01:42:56.024 --> 01:43:00.529]  And I just wish other people out there realized that the danger is in not fighting evil.
[01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:02.672]  The danger is in not standing up.
[01:43:02.952 --> 01:43:06.196]  The danger is in giving in to fear and submitting to this world system.
[01:43:07.538 --> 01:43:11.282]  There are so many straight and strong, pure, good people out there.
[01:43:12.352 --> 01:43:16.134]  That if you would just stand up, you could have a great effect in the fight against tyranny.
[01:43:16.414 --> 01:43:23.518]  And I want to salute all our listeners that spread the word about the broadcast, that support our local AM and FM affiliates and those sponsors, and that pray for us and everything.
[01:43:23.818 --> 01:43:26.360]  Because what you're doing is just as important as what I do.
[01:43:27.324 --> 01:43:40.150]  And it is humbling when I run into the families and I run into the old people and the young people and the black, white, Hispanic, Asian, doesn't matter, who just are in awe when they see me out in public or something.
[01:43:40.250 --> 01:43:45.612]  And it's obscene because I'm in awe of you, not of myself.
[01:43:45.672 --> 01:43:46.773]  We are all in this together.
[01:43:49.454 --> 01:43:52.275]  We're fighting against the beast system.
[01:43:54.236 --> 01:43:55.096]  And I'm now digressing.
[01:43:55.136 --> 01:43:56.077]  I said I'd go to phone calls.
[01:43:59.637 --> 01:44:06.643]  I'm in awe of the fighting human spirit that refuses to submit to the devilish designs of these globalists.
[01:44:08.004 --> 01:44:10.306]  And I'm in awe of you taking action.
[01:44:11.487 --> 01:44:18.072]  This morning I was lifting weights and working out, and it just hit me.
[01:44:18.132 --> 01:44:19.473]  This is an all-out war.
[01:44:19.513 --> 01:44:20.754]  This is really real.
[01:44:20.834 --> 01:44:21.735]  And I know it's real.
[01:44:22.215 --> 01:44:24.017]  I've always known it's real, but it's real.
[01:44:25.179 --> 01:44:35.923]  I mean, we're really fighting enemies that are empowered, that are possessed, that are driven, that are fulfilled by a desire to hurt innocent people and a desire to hurt beautiful people.
[01:44:35.943 --> 01:44:40.885]  And I mean beautiful in your art, your soul, your love of innocence, your love of justice.
[01:44:40.945 --> 01:44:41.606]  They hate us!
[01:44:42.766 --> 01:44:43.527]  Do you understand that?
[01:44:45.287 --> 01:44:49.029]  They absolutely hate those of us because they're scared of us.
[01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:50.910]  They've stolen the world through fraud.
[01:44:51.210 --> 01:44:54.151]  Of course they're scared of those that have chivalry and honor.
[01:44:55.509 --> 01:44:56.710]  And those that they can't buy.
[01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:58.151]  They're scared of us.
[01:44:58.231 --> 01:45:03.214]  They know good men are much more vicious and powerful than evil men.
[01:45:04.135 --> 01:45:08.297]  We just aren't wired like they are, so we don't do the things they do.
[01:45:09.858 --> 01:45:10.939]  And so we're blind.
[01:45:10.979 --> 01:45:11.900]  We have blind spots.
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:14.061]  But the enemy has blind spots as well.
[01:45:14.842 --> 01:45:18.084]  They're arrogant, and they can't help but declare their victory over us.
[01:45:19.380 --> 01:45:23.502]  Because they think celebrating the downfall of civilization will give them power.
[01:45:23.782 --> 01:45:27.383]  The downfall of civilization will bring down their world government.
[01:45:28.184 --> 01:45:31.045]  And on its rubble, we'll build the new civilization.
[01:45:35.503 --> 01:45:36.144]  Okay, I'm ranting.
[01:45:36.164 --> 01:45:36.864]  I apologize.
[01:45:37.245 --> 01:45:39.707]  Steven, thank you for putting up with me.
[01:45:39.727 --> 01:45:40.949]  You're calling from New York.
[01:45:42.010 --> 01:45:50.659]  You want to talk about feminists that I should say are anti-human, anti-women, degenerate, hateful control freaks that want to attack the human species.
[01:45:51.139 --> 01:45:52.801]  So let's just call them cancer bots.
[01:45:53.161 --> 01:45:54.663]  What do you want to say about the cancer bots?
[01:45:55.936 --> 01:45:56.857]  Yeah, I'm kidding.
[01:45:57.077 --> 01:45:58.479]  It's actually seven, but it's alright.
[01:45:58.679 --> 01:46:03.064]  Yeah, this cancer bot, uh, how did this cancer bot even get pregnant?
[01:46:03.084 --> 01:46:05.346]  I feel like no one's talking about the husband that knocked her up.
[01:46:05.386 --> 01:46:06.748]  I mean, I thought she hates men.
[01:46:07.208 --> 01:46:07.869]  You know what I mean?
[01:46:08.109 --> 01:46:10.992]  Well, she probably went to a fertility clinic and then made a mistake or something.
[01:46:11.032 --> 01:46:11.333]  I don't know.
[01:46:12.484 --> 01:46:13.385]  Oh, what do you expect?
[01:46:13.405 --> 01:46:15.326]  She did something real unnatural.
[01:46:16.186 --> 01:46:16.707]  Look at that.
[01:46:17.107 --> 01:46:19.568]  Well, um, I was just curious about that.
[01:46:19.888 --> 01:46:27.073]  I mean, I know this is a huge, you know, disgusting feminist story coming from these cancer bots, but uh... And Stefan, I'm sorry, I got your name wrong.
[01:46:28.073 --> 01:46:29.554]  No, no, no, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
[01:46:29.894 --> 01:46:37.259]  But, um, yeah, I mean, like I'm saying, these cancer bots, I mean, I'm surprised they're even having sex with men.
[01:46:37.299 --> 01:46:39.140]  I'm surprised they even think about that, you know what I mean?
[01:46:40.097 --> 01:46:49.724]  Well, I just don't get how when they, I mean, men and women of the same species were totally interconnected, how they've gotten us to be at war with our own species.
[01:46:49.984 --> 01:46:50.964]  It's a total joke.
[01:46:51.005 --> 01:46:53.066]  It's like a science fiction plot line.
[01:46:54.147 --> 01:46:54.867]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:46:55.027 --> 01:47:07.676]  I mean, my theory of it is just they got to the head of these, you know, big organizations, and I'm sure they threw them some sort of grant and told them, listen, nudge, nudge, this is, you know, this is the new ideology that's going to come out of these feminist groups.
[01:47:08.243 --> 01:47:12.994]  And, you know, a lot of these feminists, they're already lost in their mindset to begin with.
[01:47:13.636 --> 01:47:16.703]  And these feminists, they're kind of like the answer.
[01:47:17.236 --> 01:47:22.859]  You know, the ones running the organization are the answer to, you know, these lost minds.
[01:47:22.939 --> 01:47:29.002]  So that's why these lost minds end up settling, you know, doing things like this, thinking that they're actually doing something.
[01:47:29.022 --> 01:47:33.904]  Well, normal people go off and have a business or work in the community and have a husband, a wife and kids.
[01:47:34.625 --> 01:47:38.807]  And then you've got feminists, quite frankly, are just women that want to dominate women.
[01:47:39.207 --> 01:47:44.490]  Everybody knows that women fight with women and that women don't like to be bossed around by other women.
[01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:48.531]  And that women dress up for women, and that it's all about women.
[01:47:48.852 --> 01:47:51.633]  And men have always competed with men, and then women compete with women.
[01:47:52.173 --> 01:47:58.116]  It's totally unnatural to have men and women fighting with each other, but we've been taught it through movies, culture, everything.
[01:47:59.216 --> 01:48:00.697]  And it's just a total joke.
[01:48:01.619 --> 01:48:04.080]  And these people are not going to sit here and lecture me.
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:06.481]  These people do not care about women.
[01:48:06.781 --> 01:48:08.341]  That's why they don't want women to be armed.
[01:48:08.621 --> 01:48:14.423]  They want the state to be the armed alpha male, men to be emasculated, and women to be the drones.
[01:48:14.763 --> 01:48:16.303]  And it just isn't going to work that way.
[01:48:16.363 --> 01:48:17.484]  I appreciate your call.
[01:48:20.505 --> 01:48:23.986]  From a biological sense, ladies and gentlemen, it's men that are the drones.
[01:48:24.766 --> 01:48:27.467]  But again, they don't want anybody to even know these truths.
[01:48:27.927 --> 01:48:29.928]  Let's go to Kevin in West Virginia.
[01:48:29.968 --> 01:48:30.668]  You're on the air.
[01:48:30.708 --> 01:48:31.088]  Go ahead.
[01:48:31.994 --> 01:48:34.316]  Hi Alex, how's Bizarro World today?
[01:48:34.836 --> 01:48:36.658]  I tell you, we are living in Bizarro World.
[01:48:36.698 --> 01:48:40.661]  I've got a whole stack of people being microchipped and your appliances watching you.
[01:48:40.701 --> 01:48:41.622]  It's all being announced.
[01:48:42.443 --> 01:48:44.584]  Well, I have a TSA story for you.
[01:48:44.644 --> 01:48:51.410]  I just went to Haiti and went to Jamaica and I, you know, this was last week and came back last week.
[01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:55.173]  My story is involved with Fort Lauderdale Airport.
[01:48:55.620 --> 01:48:58.441]  I'm coming back into America, back into this country.
[01:48:58.921 --> 01:48:59.942]  Um, now I'm blind.
[01:49:00.182 --> 01:49:03.723]  They took my cane away from me, ran it through an x-ray machine.
[01:49:04.104 --> 01:49:06.765]  Why they wanted to x-ray my cane is beyond me.
[01:49:07.205 --> 01:49:09.666]  And then tried to herd me like cattle without my cane.
[01:49:09.686 --> 01:49:10.906]  I had no idea where to go.
[01:49:11.327 --> 01:49:16.769]  I'm holding on to my girlfriend and, you know, obviously you can tell I have a vision impairment because I'm holding on to my girlfriend.
[01:49:16.789 --> 01:49:18.169]  And they said, hey, she can't go with you.
[01:49:18.370 --> 01:49:18.930]  Hands off!
[01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:24.052]  Well, yeah, and then the best part about it, I'm holding on to her and there's
[01:49:24.645 --> 01:49:30.179]  Weird looking lady walked up and goes, oh well you two have been randomly selected for...
[01:49:31.239 --> 01:49:44.845]  I mean, I'm telling you, if they see a 95-year-old man with medical devices hanging off of him, they go crazy, like piranha, to a big ol' piece of meat.
[01:49:45.625 --> 01:49:49.727]  And it's just, it's all going to be the new troops on the streets, shaking us all down.
[01:49:49.767 --> 01:49:54.488]  They're going to be the new domestic police force, and then the illegal aliens will be above the law.
[01:49:54.809 --> 01:49:57.049]  So, how'd this end up taking place?
[01:49:57.069 --> 01:49:58.290]  What ended up happening?
[01:49:58.390 --> 01:50:00.791]  It ended up taking place in Florida.
[01:50:01.172 --> 01:50:04.053]  They separated me and my girlfriend and everything.
[01:50:04.753 --> 01:50:08.075]  They ran a bomb-sniffing dog all over me, grabbed my junk.
[01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:10.497]  I told them, you know what, this is unconstitutional.
[01:50:10.577 --> 01:50:13.998]  And they looked at me and they said, oh, you must be one of them paper people.
[01:50:14.079 --> 01:50:16.560]  Well, we're definitely going to screen you some more.
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:24.562]  No, they admit it's come out in congressional filings that the main group they demonize is patriots that know about the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:50:24.822 --> 01:50:25.882]  Because we are the enemy.
[01:50:26.543 --> 01:50:30.704]  We remember basic due process, basic freedom, so we've got to be demonized.
[01:50:31.004 --> 01:50:33.885]  So how did this all end with the new domestic security force?
[01:50:34.825 --> 01:50:46.188]  Well, after I started ranting and going off saying, you know what, I need to speak to a lawyer, this is unconstitutional, you're screwing with my rights, the whole airport started looking at me and started chanting,
[01:50:46.730 --> 01:50:53.016]  You know, USA, USA, and after they stopped doing that, the TSA just totally left the group I was with alone.
[01:50:53.637 --> 01:51:06.449]  Just totally, and after I told them... Well, the people were chanting USA because when they're scared, and they see tyranny, they go USA, USA, like a cult deal saying submit, submit, and they do that out of fear because they know they're living in a tyranny.
[01:51:07.209 --> 01:51:08.591]  But yeah, that's a scary group of zombies.

[01:52:08.891 --> 01:52:11.935]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[01:52:12.275 --> 01:52:15.519]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:21.767]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[01:52:21.847 --> 01:52:23.049]  I'm all about human potential.
[01:52:23.249 --> 01:52:25.372]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[01:52:25.452 --> 01:52:26.953]  The establishment is the opposite.
[01:52:27.033 --> 01:52:31.555]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers and the rest of the garbage.
[01:52:31.755 --> 01:52:36.117]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.

[01:54:32.992 --> 01:54:36.154]  I saw the photograph.
[01:55:03.018 --> 01:55:04.198]  We're here, folks, live.
[01:55:05.798 --> 01:55:11.420]  And don't forget the Sunday broadcast as well, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:11.860]  Central.
[01:55:15.361 --> 01:55:28.505]  I want to go right back to your calls, but I want to do a rant on air so that Rob Jacobson or Darren McBreen or one of our great video editors who make these amazing montage videos that go viral.
[01:55:30.384 --> 01:55:39.387]  So we can illustrate how earth-shattering stuff comes out, like your television is watching and listening to you and is being recorded back to the major telecoms to the government.
[01:55:40.147 --> 01:55:42.508]  And yes, your OnStar is listening to you without warrants.
[01:55:43.108 --> 01:55:44.308]  And yes, it's all been announced.
[01:55:44.388 --> 01:55:46.969]  And yes, fluoride in the water does lower IQ.
[01:55:47.129 --> 01:55:50.310]  And yes, the government was caught putting cancer viruses in vaccines.
[01:55:50.330 --> 01:55:51.010]  Here's an example.
[01:55:52.371 --> 01:55:55.752]  And yes, our government got caught arming Al-Qaeda
[01:55:58.075 --> 01:56:13.339]  In the Syrian Civil War, and now they've turned him loose and renamed him, and it's like the 1950s body snatcher, where at the end he's running out of the town, and he gets out on the highway and runs up the back of an army truck, and there's more of the pods, and he's like, oh my gosh, they're everywhere!
[01:56:13.579 --> 01:56:14.740]  You've got to warn everyone!
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:16.180]  I mean, that's how I feel.
[01:56:19.901 --> 01:56:26.623]  When there's a worldwide standardized program, where the television's watching and listening to you, and Samsung and others admit it,
[01:56:28.507 --> 01:56:35.754]  We knew this 10 years ago, or longer, but now it's all being admitted and then nothing happens!
[01:56:35.894 --> 01:56:36.995]  Nobody gets in trouble!
[01:56:39.718 --> 01:56:41.359]  Can you imagine what's going to happen next?
[01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:44.963]  They're setting up incrementally Homeland Security to just start disappearing people.
[01:56:45.003 --> 01:56:45.723]  It's already going on.
[01:56:46.064 --> 01:56:47.065]  NDAA, all of it.
[01:56:47.605 --> 01:56:49.507]  Emergency Centers Establishment Act, all of it.
[01:56:50.528 --> 01:56:52.370]  I mean, what person in their right mind
[01:56:54.167 --> 01:56:59.750]  Why on earth would so-called conservative talk show host cover up the FEMA camps and do hit pieces on us saying it isn't true?
[01:57:00.891 --> 01:57:07.554]  Why on earth would Brian Williams be for Obamacare when he knows full well it's got death panels, was written by insurance companies, is a giant screw job?
[01:57:09.635 --> 01:57:14.698]  Why on God's green earth would we be starting a war with Russia right now?
[01:57:15.918 --> 01:57:16.719]  And be the bad guys?
[01:57:18.717 --> 01:57:19.017]  Why?
[01:57:19.037 --> 01:57:22.980]  I mean, I really feel like running around the street, jumping in front of cars, trying to warn people.
[01:57:23.180 --> 01:57:25.081]  I mean, somebody's got to get hysterical here.
[01:57:25.421 --> 01:57:28.943]  And look, I didn't do this in a psychological warfare manipulation on purpose.
[01:57:29.503 --> 01:57:32.465]  I'm just organically successful because I really am concerned.
[01:57:32.745 --> 01:57:33.826]  I really am freaked out.
[01:57:34.446 --> 01:57:35.707]  I really have seen the tyranny.
[01:57:36.888 --> 01:57:38.769]  I really have learned to not trust the system.
[01:57:40.239 --> 01:57:43.420]  And I know it's getting worse because I've grown up seeing it.
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:48.502]  And so I am running around, freaking out, trying to warn people as best I can.
[01:57:49.602 --> 01:57:54.304]  And I'm going to keep doing it so that as things get worse, people remember, oh, hey, that guy was right.
[01:57:54.844 --> 01:57:56.265]  Maybe he'll be right about the next thing.
[01:57:56.365 --> 01:57:57.385]  Oh, he is right about that.
[01:57:57.725 --> 01:57:59.806]  And then we'll listen to me about solutions.
[01:58:00.976 --> 01:58:06.761]  The New World Order running our society might as well be a deep space alien invasion.
[01:58:07.281 --> 01:58:10.343]  And I've been sent emails and calls going, are you really trying to say it's aliens?
[01:58:10.744 --> 01:58:11.404]  No, I'm not.
[01:58:11.524 --> 01:58:14.367]  I'm saying the globalists are that big an enemy.
[01:58:15.242 --> 01:58:18.203]  Okay, and they operate and act like they're aliens.
[01:58:18.663 --> 01:58:22.544]  They say they're another species, they're super sapien, they're gonna get rid of us.
[01:58:22.804 --> 01:58:25.084]  They've already decided they're taking over, okay?
[01:58:25.305 --> 01:58:26.865]  This is like a war we've never seen.
[01:58:27.445 --> 01:58:31.066]  It's a cultural, scientific, rewrite, takeover.
[01:58:34.487 --> 01:58:35.647]  And so, we gotta warn people!
[01:58:37.868 --> 01:58:42.729]  It's like... Clockwork Orange meets... Blade Runner...
[01:58:44.511 --> 01:58:47.014]  Meet Soylent Green meets Idiocracy.
[01:58:47.054 --> 01:58:50.317]  We'll be right back with your phone calls and our number three.
[01:58:50.518 --> 01:58:51.579]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:51.659 --> 01:58:54.222]  Mike and Steve and visit GCN Live.
[01:58:54.442 --> 01:58:57.105]  Elizabeth and Truth and Mesha.
[01:58:57.125 --> 01:58:57.946]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:59:00.538 --> 01:59:01.579]  In the near future.
[01:59:01.859 --> 01:59:05.502]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:59:05.522 --> 01:59:06.002]  Security alert.
[01:59:06.362 --> 01:59:07.383]  Security alert.
[01:59:07.603 --> 01:59:09.345]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:59:09.605 --> 01:59:10.225]  Analysis.
[01:59:10.485 --> 01:59:11.126]  InfoWars.
[01:59:11.206 --> 01:59:13.288]  Building independent media operations.
[01:59:13.308 --> 01:59:18.151]  But the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:59:18.191 --> 01:59:19.152]  Prime Directive.
[01:59:19.232 --> 01:59:20.613]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:59:20.773 --> 01:59:23.555]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:59:23.635 --> 01:59:26.698]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:59:26.878 --> 01:59:29.099]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:59:29.159 --> 01:59:29.880]  These people are a
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:35.184]  They're never going to stop.
[01:59:35.464 --> 01:59:39.348]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:59:39.528 --> 01:59:53.899]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:55.521]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:59:55.541 --> 01:59:56.301]  You can feel it.
[02:00:01.932 --> 02:00:04.518]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:15.512 --> 02:00:19.674]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:20.334 --> 02:00:21.135]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.915 --> 02:00:22.816]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.456 --> 02:00:27.098]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.658 --> 02:00:31.760]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.242 --> 02:00:43.626]  Finishing up what I was trying to say earlier, I've been hysterical about what's happening with the globalist takeover for 23 years or so, 20 years on air.
[02:00:46.215 --> 02:00:54.363]  And people have genuinely heard the concern, seen the information, because it is hysteria meets facts.
[02:00:56.545 --> 02:01:00.869]  And so we get people interested, they look at the facts, they find out we're telling the truth, they say, then what do we do about it?
[02:01:02.090 --> 02:01:04.693]  Well, I'm just here trying to warn the public so we can figure out what to do.
[02:01:08.596 --> 02:01:11.199]  But we are really faced with a scientific takeover.
[02:01:12.227 --> 02:01:24.834]  But there's seven and a half billion of us, if we just collectively wake up to the globalist takeover, the conspiracy theory that doesn't exist, and we admit it exists, and start changing our worldview around battling that, we win!
[02:01:24.854 --> 02:01:36.981]  It'd be like the pod people taking over, and then the doctor runs over to warn a family, and it's a bunch of feminists, and they go, we don't want to listen to you, you're a man, and aliens are taking over.
[02:01:38.427 --> 02:01:46.853]  Or a white guy, you know, a black guy runs over to a bunch of white people and says, help me, help me, you know, there's criminals coming over the hill, and they're like, shut up, we're white, we don't listen to you.
[02:01:46.873 --> 02:01:49.614]  I mean, it's the same stupid mindlessness.
[02:01:52.796 --> 02:01:53.377]  It's pointless.
[02:01:56.741 --> 02:01:59.622]  And the globalist argument is the public is stupid and deserves this.
[02:02:00.422 --> 02:02:08.005]  And that we are just a bunch of useless eaters that won't stand up for ourselves, and so we deserve to be poisoned, dumbed down, and basically expunged from history to save the earth.
[02:02:08.465 --> 02:02:09.265]  And that's the argument?
[02:02:09.285 --> 02:02:10.846]  That's the excuse for total takeover?
[02:02:13.747 --> 02:02:21.450]  And if you don't stand up and say no, the globalists consider you meat on the table.
[02:02:22.810 --> 02:02:24.050]  Let's go to Stephen Ohio.
[02:02:24.090 --> 02:02:25.271]  Steve, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:02:27.165 --> 02:02:32.711]  Hi Alex, I just had a few quick things that I wanted to bring up.
[02:02:33.271 --> 02:02:36.314]  I was in the service for 9 years.
[02:02:36.355 --> 02:02:38.317]  I was on active duty for 9 years in the Navy.
[02:02:41.319 --> 02:02:48.865]  While I was in, I've been out for about 15 years now, more than 15 years, but they had me give a sample.
[02:02:48.885 --> 02:02:54.108]  They had everybody within our group, or well, our duty station, I should say, everybody there.
[02:02:54.188 --> 02:02:55.670]  There was probably 150 people.
[02:02:56.030 --> 02:03:03.435]  They had everybody give a sample, a tissue sample, a blood sample, and a saliva sample,
[02:03:11.976 --> 02:03:22.603]  I've seen those reports over the years and heard that from veterans that they are creating an illegal DNA database of the military.
[02:03:23.404 --> 02:03:25.145]  Did you guys ask what it was for at the time?
[02:03:36.574 --> 02:03:41.415]  Asking for a copy, because you can get a copy of all your medical records, your service records.
[02:03:41.575 --> 02:03:43.155]  And let me guess, that wasn't in there?
[02:03:44.156 --> 02:03:44.776]  Exactly.
[02:03:45.376 --> 02:03:50.457]  I asked the lady who worked in the, basically the military checkout.
[02:03:50.857 --> 02:03:56.038]  I mean, I'm a nobody, but I asked, I said, well where's that little 3x5 cart?
[02:03:56.418 --> 02:04:00.099]  It had three little black squares on it, and it was a DOD number.
[02:04:00.619 --> 02:04:05.080]  Obviously the cart doesn't have the two whole punch stamps, but military people know what I'm talking about.
[02:04:07.594 --> 02:04:14.718]  They put the samples, they put each one in one of the little squares, and they covered it with like a clear piece of packing tape type of a thing.
[02:04:15.158 --> 02:04:15.859]  And it wasn't there.
[02:04:15.879 --> 02:04:19.862]  And a lady looked at me like I had three heads when I asked her where it was.
[02:04:21.403 --> 02:04:23.124]  And she just said, I have no idea.
[02:04:23.184 --> 02:04:25.385]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[02:04:25.745 --> 02:04:28.567]  But it was that incident, and I have one other quick one that's brief.
[02:04:28.667 --> 02:04:34.251]  And I just want to tell this to the people out there who don't think that nothing can be hidden.
[02:04:35.311 --> 02:04:36.012]  I was on a ship.
[02:04:36.750 --> 02:04:38.411]  I was on it for five years.
[02:05:09.508 --> 02:05:13.369]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.

[02:05:43.144 --> 02:05:47.106]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:47.426 --> 02:05:48.887]  Can you put two and two together?

[02:06:18.212 --> 02:06:24.797]  NASA has already set the countdown timer, and right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[02:06:25.317 --> 02:06:28.758]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S.

[02:06:36.161 --> 02:06:37.421]  Mass riots will follow.
[02:06:37.802 --> 02:06:39.502]  Ancient diseases will reemerge.

[02:08:23.636 --> 02:08:25.397]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:27.098 --> 02:08:40.364]  When the night has come and the land is dark and the moon is the only light we'll see.
[02:08:43.165 --> 02:08:46.086]  No, I won't be afraid.
[02:08:46.227 --> 02:08:46.427]  No.
[02:08:56.676 --> 02:09:01.299]  Well, Vani Hari is going to be joining us in about two minutes, the author of The Food Babe Way.
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:02.760]  We are selling the book.
[02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:05.603]  It has now just now officially come out.
[02:09:05.663 --> 02:09:07.944]  We have it available at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:09:08.905 --> 02:09:09.906]  I can't wait to read the book.
[02:09:09.926 --> 02:09:10.746]  I've not had time.
[02:09:10.787 --> 02:09:11.907]  It just came in last week.
[02:09:12.748 --> 02:09:14.629]  It is a plan, very easy to follow.
[02:09:15.770 --> 02:09:19.513]  To lose a lot of weight, look years younger, and get healthy in just 21 days.
[02:09:20.414 --> 02:09:23.896]  And I intend to read the book and try to apply as much of it as I can.
[02:09:23.997 --> 02:09:25.097]  By that, nobody's perfect.
[02:09:25.798 --> 02:09:27.799]  But it's really changed her life following this.
[02:09:28.340 --> 02:09:33.524]  And now, we've got all these headlines where, you know, she's getting General Mills to do that.
[02:09:33.604 --> 02:09:34.785]  She's getting this company to do this.
[02:09:35.365 --> 02:09:41.908]  Because the listeners of this show and other programs she goes on on the internet are responding and taking action, victory after victory.
[02:09:42.269 --> 02:09:44.490]  Foodbabe gets General Mills to pull preservatives.
[02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:52.174]  General Mills said, let me go back to the headline, General Mills said BHT was FDA approved.
[02:09:53.223 --> 02:09:53.803]  But it wasn't.
[02:09:54.104 --> 02:09:57.526]  So that's all coming up with The Food Babe in just a moment.
[02:09:57.546 --> 02:10:01.048]  But finishing up, Steve, in Ohio, a Navy veteran.
[02:10:01.548 --> 02:10:04.190]  You were saying people that don't think you can cover something up.
[02:10:04.590 --> 02:10:05.891]  Well, I was on a ship.
[02:10:05.911 --> 02:10:07.011]  You started to tell the story.
[02:10:07.492 --> 02:10:08.592]  Please tell us that story.
[02:10:10.580 --> 02:10:14.383]  Okay, briefly, I'll make it quick because I know you're time-constrained.
[02:10:14.864 --> 02:10:20.148]  Alright, during the first Gulf War, that's when I was in, and my ship was detached to go down to Panama.
[02:10:20.168 --> 02:10:21.669]  A lot of people don't remember Panama.
[02:10:21.889 --> 02:10:23.491]  There was a coup attempt that went on down there.
[02:10:24.071 --> 02:10:30.677]  Anyway, my ship was detached down there, and it was myself, and like I said, I'm a nobody, just a regular sailor.
[02:10:31.057 --> 02:10:38.063]  Anyhow, I was pulled back there, the back of the ship, because I worked on some aviation equipment.
[02:10:38.523 --> 02:10:42.727]  On our smaller ship, it was a... I'm not even going to get into the type of ship.
[02:10:42.807 --> 02:10:48.252]  Anyway, it's a combatant ship, but it's not a helo or normally carries aircraft.
[02:10:48.692 --> 02:10:50.294]  But we work with helos all the time.
[02:10:50.734 --> 02:10:55.378]  And where people talk about this bin Laden raid and everything and silent helicopters.
[02:10:55.811 --> 02:11:10.965]  I can tell you that back in 1991, when we were down in Panama, we had those things land on our ship, and they didn't allow anybody past midships except myself, the flood, the flight officer, and the commo, the communications officer.
[02:11:11.285 --> 02:11:20.534]  They only allowed the three of us back there, and they had me back there only because of the landing equipment, because it was a nighttime land, and I can tell you that we were running a dark ship
[02:11:21.272 --> 02:11:24.754]  Out in the gulf there, there's two gulfs on both sides of the Panama Canal.
[02:11:25.114 --> 02:11:28.136]  Anyway, we're running dark ship, which you're not supposed to do.
[02:11:28.256 --> 02:11:36.721]  Anyway, we landed dark ship, and all I can say is, there was nothing there, and then all of a sudden, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:11:37.121 --> 02:11:38.182]  The helo come in.
[02:11:38.202 --> 02:11:40.383]  I mean, I've been on so many landings.
[02:11:40.944 --> 02:11:46.087]  I mean, you can hear the helos come in, but there was nothing until this thing was literally on top of us.
[02:11:46.487 --> 02:11:48.628]  I looked at the commo and the flight officer.
[02:11:48.688 --> 02:11:49.849]  I said, what the heck is that?
[02:11:50.612 --> 02:11:58.816]  Doors open, all I saw was red lights, guys without themselves dogged it down to the deck of the ship, and then they shut it down.
[02:11:59.396 --> 02:12:05.739]  No sooner did they do that, I mean we waited there for a period of time, next thing you know you saw doors open on both sides,
[02:12:06.681 --> 02:12:12.583]  Men jump out, remove their own, unchalk their own helo, and then just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and it was gone.
[02:12:13.083 --> 02:12:31.971]  When I was about seven, eight years old, my father and I, driving back from East Texas to Dallas, saw four, I guess that'd be a formation, where there's, yeah, four, four what looked exactly like stealth fighters, but they were
[02:12:33.001 --> 02:12:41.964]  Painted up kind of silver gray with kind of a green camo pattern on them, flying at about 200 feet off the ground just right over cornfields.
[02:12:43.004 --> 02:12:48.606]  And my dad remembered as a kid seeing what looked like B-2 bombers fly over when he was a little kid back in the 50s.
[02:12:48.666 --> 02:12:50.826]  So that's exactly what I'm talking about.
[02:12:50.986 --> 02:12:56.348]  I've had private conversations with Buzz Aldrin, second guy to walk on the moon.
[02:12:57.481 --> 02:13:00.764]  And he's been on air and said stuff that became international news.
[02:13:01.445 --> 02:13:03.346]  In fact, I'm not even going to say what Buzz Aldrin told me.
[02:13:03.406 --> 02:13:08.811]  It's just all too... I'm just saying the public has no idea what's really going on.
[02:13:09.231 --> 02:13:12.815]  And this is 1989, I guess, if it was the Panama Invasion, correct?
[02:13:14.216 --> 02:13:15.577]  Yeah, it was 89-90, that time frame.
[02:13:17.348 --> 02:13:18.088]  I can say this.
[02:13:18.508 --> 02:13:19.749]  I got in in the late 80s.
[02:13:19.789 --> 02:13:20.509]  That's when I was in.
[02:13:20.529 --> 02:13:24.870]  I signed up when I was 16, early, but I never actually got to go until I was 17.
[02:13:25.470 --> 02:13:29.571]  My dad actually had to sign with me when I signed in when I was 16.
[02:13:29.951 --> 02:13:31.351]  So I'm in my mid-40s now.
[02:13:31.411 --> 02:13:32.752]  But I can say this.
[02:13:33.152 --> 02:13:41.854]  There are so many things that military people see and don't even realize, or they do, and they just know nobody will ever believe them when they tell them.
[02:13:42.344 --> 02:13:51.067]  I could tell you of one other thing, I'm not going to do it now, but I could tell you off air about the law of threes, and it's not the normal law of threes, the rule of threes that people talk about.
[02:13:51.508 --> 02:13:53.748]  And why they taught me it, I do not know.
[02:13:53.929 --> 02:13:56.069]  To save my life, I don't know why they told it to me.
[02:13:56.089 --> 02:13:58.270]  Well, listen, Vani Hari's about to be our guest.
[02:13:58.290 --> 02:13:59.691]  She leaves at about 40 after.
[02:14:00.091 --> 02:14:03.012]  If you can hold, or I'll call you back, give us your number.
[02:14:03.092 --> 02:14:05.093]  I want you to finish the story, okay?
[02:14:06.215 --> 02:14:06.475]  Okay.
[02:14:06.975 --> 02:14:10.437]  Alright, John Harmon, get Steve a number if he wants, or he can hold.
[02:14:10.917 --> 02:14:16.340]  And I appreciate Vani Hari holding while I took that call, but that's the type of interesting calls that we get.
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:17.861]  Here's an example.
[02:14:18.401 --> 02:14:27.826]  They declassified in 1989 the Stealth Bomber, and then a few years later the Stealth Fighter.
[02:14:29.198 --> 02:14:32.721]  And they admitted that it had been in service for about 20 years before it was seen.
[02:14:33.362 --> 02:14:36.044]  The SR-71 Blackbird was in service by 1950.
[02:14:36.985 --> 02:14:40.148]  They still claim it's the fastest aircraft in the world.
[02:14:40.168 --> 02:14:41.289]  It can go like Mach 5.
[02:14:42.871 --> 02:14:43.752]  Probably even faster.
[02:14:45.017 --> 02:14:47.820]  Do you believe a plane in 1950 is still the fastest plane?
[02:14:48.181 --> 02:14:51.044]  By the way, it wasn't admitted to be around until the 70s.
[02:14:51.605 --> 02:14:55.409]  So, I'm telling you, the space program you see is just the front.
[02:14:56.030 --> 02:14:57.071]  All of it is a front.
[02:14:57.111 --> 02:15:01.476]  There is a huge, 20 times the size of the Manhattan Project.
[02:15:02.057 --> 02:15:05.119]  I'm being conservative from the intel I have.
[02:15:05.479 --> 02:15:06.300]  Space program.
[02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:07.861]  I mean, it's just huge.
[02:15:08.681 --> 02:15:10.602]  And see, it's a breakaway civilization.
[02:15:11.243 --> 02:15:12.643]  They feed us what they want.
[02:15:12.804 --> 02:15:14.264]  They put in the water what they want.
[02:15:14.545 --> 02:15:15.625]  They give us the media.
[02:15:15.645 --> 02:15:17.186]  They tell us Obamacare is free.
[02:15:17.606 --> 02:15:19.488]  They tell us GMO isn't bad for us.
[02:15:19.548 --> 02:15:22.089]  In every study, it's killing the animals or deforming them.
[02:15:22.149 --> 02:15:23.110]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[02:15:23.590 --> 02:15:26.052]  There's no bad side effects from vaccines.
[02:15:26.112 --> 02:15:28.173]  And then, it's just a laundry list.
[02:15:28.253 --> 02:15:29.734]  It says on the insert, it can kill you.
[02:15:30.848 --> 02:15:31.849]  Give you diabetes!
[02:15:32.970 --> 02:15:33.850]  Eat your pancreas!
[02:15:34.491 --> 02:15:35.912]  You can read the insert!
[02:15:36.372 --> 02:15:40.576]  See, if I can't get people to read the insert, how will I get them to admit the other stuff?
[02:15:40.676 --> 02:15:46.441]  Like, in guinea pig studies, a BT corn, or these GMO potatoes.
[02:15:46.701 --> 02:15:48.442]  Joining us is Vani Hari.
[02:15:48.743 --> 02:15:54.367]  We're selling her book, so you support her, support yourself, and support InfoWars when you buy it from infowarsstore.com.
[02:15:54.687 --> 02:15:59.651]  Break free from the hidden toxins in your food, and lose weight, look years younger, and get healthy in just 21 days.
[02:16:00.612 --> 02:16:23.072]  I for my 41st birthday giving myself this book and I'm gonna try to read it over the next week and I'm gonna try to put quite a bit of this into action because I've already gotten a lot healthier I want to go the rest of the way and her testimony and what she's done is really amazing she's a go-getter but also look what she's done with activist help all over the news they're announcing
[02:16:24.540 --> 02:16:27.442]  What the media and food industry won't tell you, that's one headline.
[02:16:27.482 --> 02:16:31.864]  I saw one, The Food Babe, Enemy of Chemicals, The Atlantic.
[02:16:32.624 --> 02:16:37.287]  I saw another one about, you know, all the amazing things she's doing.
[02:16:37.307 --> 02:16:42.529]  I've been seeing all these headlines about the big victories she's been having across the board.
[02:16:43.230 --> 02:16:45.531]  General Mills just announced they're pulling a bunch of chemicals.
[02:16:45.951 --> 02:16:56.699]  So, she takes action, she tells the public, it's a smart, good-looking, well-spoken woman, showing them the documents, people are listening, they're reacting, and these companies are removing it.
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:03.784]  So, we've reached a tipping point, and she's one focal point in that larger war for health, transparency, and choice.
[02:17:04.085 --> 02:17:12.191]  So, Vani Hari, thank you so much, and again, congratulations on another human success story taking action for justice.
[02:17:13.390 --> 02:17:16.954]  Thank you so much for having me here, Alex, and happy early or late birthday.
[02:17:16.994 --> 02:17:17.775]  When's your birthday?
[02:17:17.956 --> 02:17:20.519]  It's my birthday today, so I was just... Exactly, okay.
[02:17:20.719 --> 02:17:21.881]  Oh my gosh, happy birthday.
[02:17:21.921 --> 02:17:24.003]  I'm so honored to be on your birthday show.
[02:17:24.023 --> 02:17:24.704]  Oh, you're so sweet.
[02:17:24.724 --> 02:17:25.505]  Awesome.
[02:17:26.126 --> 02:17:26.927]  That is so awesome.
[02:17:26.947 --> 02:17:28.288]  Well listen, where do you want to go first?
[02:17:28.349 --> 02:17:30.191]  All these latest victories that we've been having?
[02:17:30.431 --> 02:17:30.892]  And then the book?
[02:17:31.638 --> 02:17:32.659]  Yeah, I think it's important.
[02:17:32.679 --> 02:17:34.360]  Let's talk about what happened last week.
[02:17:34.961 --> 02:17:39.225]  I was absolutely stunned to find out what happened, and it happened so quickly.
[02:17:39.305 --> 02:17:50.935]  You know, about a month ago, I started reaching out to General Mills and Kellogg's and asking them about an ingredient they use in their cereals here in the United States, but not in other countries.
[02:17:50.975 --> 02:17:57.081]  And that ingredient is called BHT, otherwise known as butylated hydroxytululene.
[02:17:57.481 --> 02:18:12.379]  And it's labeled BHT on the label of different cereals, it's added to the packaging, and its purpose is actually to leach into the food, to preserve the food longer so it can stay on shelves up to 18 months at your grocery store.
[02:18:12.759 --> 02:18:20.423]  Now, this is a chemical that's been invented just for the food industry to make things preserved longer.
[02:18:20.743 --> 02:18:24.505]  They don't add really a health benefit to consumers.
[02:18:24.785 --> 02:18:32.949]  And actually, the studies show that this chemical is linked to cancer in animal studies and can be an endocrine disruptor.
[02:18:33.009 --> 02:18:34.549]  And this is not me saying this.
[02:18:34.609 --> 02:18:41.153]  This is scientists at the Environmental Working Group, other medical professionals that have reviewed these studies and data.
[02:18:42.313 --> 02:18:42.834]  I don't know.
[02:18:59.259 --> 02:19:04.721]  Earlier this year to say, hey, you know, I really want to see a change here.
[02:19:04.781 --> 02:19:06.962]  I want to see that this chemical be removed.
[02:19:06.982 --> 02:19:11.824]  I was asking them, why do you use this chemical in American cereals and not in your UK cereals?
[02:19:11.964 --> 02:19:15.485]  And these are the exact same cereals that are being sold, Alex.
[02:19:15.505 --> 02:19:23.148]  This is a box of Rice Krispies with BHT here in the United States and a box of Rice Krispies without it in Europe.
[02:19:23.408 --> 02:19:24.228]  How is that fair?
[02:19:24.588 --> 02:19:25.609]  How is that ethical?
[02:19:25.869 --> 02:19:36.477]  It is completely immoral that these companies are allowed to make their products safer for other citizens and they don't have the moral and ethical obligation to do the same here in the United States.
[02:19:36.597 --> 02:19:41.681]  And so when I asked them these questions, they wrote me back a standard reply and said, BHT is safe.
[02:19:42.221 --> 02:19:47.145]  It is, you know, it actually has some controversial chemicals.
[02:19:47.265 --> 02:19:47.705]  Excuse me.
[02:19:47.725 --> 02:19:51.108]  I just need a sip of water here.
[02:19:52.615 --> 02:19:58.499]  While you're getting that sip of water, expanding on this, these are petrochemicals.
[02:19:59.620 --> 02:20:04.923]  And they're grandfathered in, thousands of them, that are sprinkled through processed foods.
[02:20:05.644 --> 02:20:07.685]  And quite frankly, we know what's going on.
[02:20:08.225 --> 02:20:10.507]  A lot of poisonous chemicals are highly addictive.
[02:20:11.598 --> 02:20:20.200]  They also stimulate people to want to even eat more, and that's why they don't want to pull them out, because we're all in a giant Petri dish.
[02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:36.183]  That's why they don't want to take... I mean, I've seen the cases where they're trying to change the name of Aspartame, or they're trying to change the name to confuse people of MSG, where they're trying to change all these different names of mercury in the vaccines to confuse the public.
[02:20:36.223 --> 02:20:36.863]  So if they can't
[02:20:37.731 --> 02:20:42.335]  Keep us from not reading the labels.
[02:20:42.635 --> 02:20:43.836]  They're just going to change the name.
[02:20:43.856 --> 02:20:45.338]  I mean, a great example of that is what?
[02:20:46.118 --> 02:20:48.520]  They're now going to change the name of high fructose corn syrup.
[02:20:50.442 --> 02:20:56.567]  Yeah, that is really scary that they're just going to take off the high fructose and just, you know, use a different name for it.
[02:20:56.587 --> 02:21:02.272]  And I tell you, you know, these food manufacturers are really going to be held accountable now.
[02:21:02.292 --> 02:21:03.573]  The public is waking up.
[02:21:04.134 --> 02:21:04.914]  And I tell you,
[02:21:05.615 --> 02:21:13.581]  Because I received such a misleading message from General Mills and Kellogg's when I reached out to them, you know, I wanted to start a petition.
[02:21:13.621 --> 02:21:22.067]  So I launched a petition last Thursday on my blog, foodbabe.com slash cereal, to really require these food manufacturers to
[02:21:23.348 --> 02:21:41.100]  You know, finally remove this chemical for Americans, and I tell you, hours afterwards, it was so amazing, after thousands of Facebook posts, thousands of phone calls, thousands of signatures, over 17,000 signatures or something like that, in the first few hours, General Mills started tweeting to random people.
[02:21:41.180 --> 02:21:41.601]  Not me!
[02:21:41.641 --> 02:21:42.922]  They won't talk to me, Alex.
[02:21:42.942 --> 02:21:47.245]  You know, I try to reach out to these companies ahead of time to ask them questions.
[02:21:47.305 --> 02:21:48.986]  I mean, I wish they would really, like,
[02:21:49.406 --> 02:21:49.667]  Oh, no.
[02:22:08.650 --> 02:22:10.091]  Well, it's simple.
[02:22:10.151 --> 02:22:12.652]  Humans aren't supposed to eat processed petrochemicals.
[02:22:30.043 --> 02:22:36.470]  I mean, these come out of oil refineries as distillates, as junk that they'd have to process and get rid of.
[02:22:36.510 --> 02:22:46.560]  Instead, it gets pumped into the food industry, just like the aluminum industry and the phosphate industry can't use the fluoride, so they get cities to pay to put the fluoride in the water.
[02:22:47.161 --> 02:22:50.684]  I mean, it's simply amazing what a scam they've set up, but the good news is,
[02:22:51.605 --> 02:22:58.617]  Like dominoes, every time you inspire people to sign your petitions and contact these companies, they change.
[02:22:58.998 --> 02:23:03.385]  Which is a testament to when the public takes action, they get results.
[02:23:05.233 --> 02:23:12.001]  They really do, and it was so amazing because really taking these two giant cereal manufacturers and asking them to do this.
[02:23:12.061 --> 02:23:16.667]  I know if one said they're going to do it, the other one has to in a way to even survive.
[02:23:17.047 --> 02:23:22.974]  And so Kellogg's a few hours later said, okay, we're going to put a team in place to look for natural alternatives.
[02:23:23.335 --> 02:23:24.997]  Here's the question I want to ask.
[02:23:25.137 --> 02:23:29.021]  Let's just logically use our brains here and use some common sense.
[02:23:29.341 --> 02:23:35.747]  If they're already doing this for their serials overseas, what team needs to be in place to make this change?
[02:23:36.027 --> 02:23:39.491]  Can't they just email their colleagues, like send them a basic email?
[02:23:39.531 --> 02:23:40.752]  Hey, how do you do this?
[02:23:41.072 --> 02:23:41.833]  And implement it?
[02:23:42.053 --> 02:23:46.077]  It's absolutely ludicrous that even today millions of children
[02:23:46.337 --> 02:23:48.479]  Are still eating this BHT chemical.
[02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:55.146]  It needs to be out of our food, needs to be out of our cereals, and we need to demand a timeline from General Mills and Kellogg's.
[02:23:55.166 --> 02:24:00.031]  So if you're listening to this broadcast, call them at their corporate headquarters, ask them for a timeline.
[02:24:00.292 --> 02:24:01.173]  This needs to stop.
[02:24:01.690 --> 02:24:04.533]  And let's expand, though, on the establishment striking back.
[02:24:04.673 --> 02:24:15.544]  NPR, this national petroleum radio, fake liberal radio in my experience, pro-war, fake liberal system, has come out and says, is the food babe a fear monger?
[02:24:16.144 --> 02:24:17.485]  Scientists are speaking.
[02:24:18.246 --> 02:24:36.147]  So, Europe and everybody else has this band, and you're just simply saying, list your ingredients, take the stuff out, take the silly putty ingredients out of your Chicken McNuggets McDonald's, and they're freaking out, acting like you're a ten-headed monster, that you would dare do this, but they're really scared that you're having success.
[02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:39.701]  Oh, very, very scared, and it's so interesting.
[02:24:39.741 --> 02:24:41.542]  That article was very one-sided.
[02:24:41.963 --> 02:24:45.184]  Interviewed the most vocal scientists against me.
[02:24:45.224 --> 02:24:53.209]  I mean, these are people, if you go to their Facebook pages, and you go to their sites, and go to their blogs, every other article sometimes is about me.
[02:24:53.489 --> 02:24:58.872]  Why are these people spending so much time writing about me versus trying to help people?
[02:24:58.892 --> 02:25:01.193]  Because they're PR flacks for the chemical companies.
[02:25:02.366 --> 02:25:14.763]  Well, you know, I don't know exactly all of the industry ties, but I do know this, is that I'm a regular, everyday person trying to change the food industry with other... No, you're a bad person.
[02:25:15.063 --> 02:25:18.267]  We shouldn't... We should have a growth hormone in the milk.
[02:25:19.048 --> 02:25:23.892]  And cigarettes are good for you too, and the doctors told us back in the 60s they were good for us.
[02:25:24.233 --> 02:25:25.994]  I think you're a conspiracy theorist about that.
[02:25:26.655 --> 02:25:31.319]  And I think it's wrong to even, you know, want to know if chemicals are in the food.
[02:25:31.419 --> 02:25:33.161]  How dare you?
[02:25:33.968 --> 02:25:39.973]  They want to make us feel stupid by saying that you have to be a scientist or nutritionist to know how to eat.
[02:25:40.494 --> 02:25:46.118]  My new book, The Food Babe Way, teaches you how you can become your own nutritionist.
[02:25:50.074 --> 02:25:51.616]  GMO, I don't feel good.
[02:25:51.656 --> 02:25:53.858]  I mean, if I eat aspartame, I get a headache.
[02:25:53.978 --> 02:25:59.744]  Or MSG, I mean, I don't need to be a rocket scientist to know I'm allergic to honeybees, because I swell up if I get stung by one.
[02:26:00.144 --> 02:26:01.265]  Same thing with MSG.
[02:26:01.505 --> 02:26:04.048]  I get a horrible headache for two days if I eat it.
[02:26:04.428 --> 02:26:06.530]  So I've been staying away from it my whole life.
[02:26:06.671 --> 02:26:10.474]  I learned not to eat Doritos when I was a kid, because they gave me a headache.
[02:26:10.514 --> 02:26:11.696]  Does that make me a bad person?
[02:26:12.967 --> 02:26:14.387]  No, it doesn't, Alex.
[02:26:14.428 --> 02:26:15.048]  You're smart.
[02:26:15.148 --> 02:26:23.250]  But like, really, we have to start paying attention to what's in our food, and I want to give people the habits on how to live this lifestyle.
[02:26:23.610 --> 02:26:25.931]  You know it's hard to live in this over-processed world.
[02:26:26.011 --> 02:26:32.873]  We're always so busy, going so fast in our lives, and we don't have time to check all the ingredients and do all this legwork and homework.
[02:26:33.113 --> 02:26:34.914]  And that's why I want to do it for you.
[02:26:34.974 --> 02:26:41.698]  And here comes a troublemaker like you having great success getting major beer companies to list what additives they have and getting them to remove them.
[02:26:41.958 --> 02:26:44.279]  How dare you want people to have pure healthy beer?
[02:26:44.619 --> 02:26:45.640]  How dare you?
[02:26:46.060 --> 02:26:49.742]  How dare you try to get GMO labeling so people can make their own choices?
[02:26:50.083 --> 02:26:51.203]  You are a monster!
[02:26:51.603 --> 02:26:56.046]  No one should order your book at Infowarsstore.com or Amazon or wherever else.
[02:26:56.306 --> 02:26:56.866]  The Food Babe.
[02:26:57.086 --> 02:27:03.130]  Why don't you tell us about the Food Babe way, just absolute monstrosity of evil.
[02:27:03.690 --> 02:27:05.151]  How do folks get this evil book?
[02:27:07.092 --> 02:27:10.775]  That's what they're saying on Amazon in their one-star reviews.
[02:27:10.875 --> 02:27:11.675]  It's really funny.
[02:27:11.715 --> 02:27:22.582]  So if you do read this book and you have your hands on it and you get it from either the InfoWare store or somewhere else, please take the time and read and leave an honest review on this book.
[02:27:22.662 --> 02:27:23.282]  Because this is
[02:27:41.510 --> 02:27:41.730]  Believe it.
[02:27:41.850 --> 02:27:42.211]  Believe it.
[02:27:42.311 --> 02:27:43.351]  This is in this book.
[02:27:43.411 --> 02:27:44.192]  This is research.
[02:27:44.232 --> 02:27:45.093]  I went undercover.
[02:27:45.433 --> 02:28:01.165]  I found out this information so you can protect yourself and your family, and you can find out what to eat at these places if you find yourself there, and how to eat at any restaurant in America, whether it's a Thai restaurant, a Chinese restaurant, Italian restaurant, or a Japanese restaurant.
[02:28:01.465 --> 02:28:10.631]  Just finding the right things to eat at each place with the least amount of toxic load and the least amount of food additives within those substances.
[02:28:10.691 --> 02:28:13.874]  And so, it's a practical guide.
[02:28:13.954 --> 02:28:19.798]  It is a 21-day plan, 21 habits that I taught myself on how to live this lifestyle.
[02:28:20.218 --> 02:28:21.279]  I didn't always look like this.
[02:28:21.519 --> 02:28:25.401]  I never actually felt like this for a very long part of my life.
[02:28:25.881 --> 02:28:43.711]  I was walking around like a zombie and it wasn't until I started putting these principles into place and habits that allowed me to live this way, live a way where I didn't have to always be on a diet, that I could maintain my ideal weight, that I could actually go and enjoy foods that I love in the right way.
[02:28:44.231 --> 02:28:46.512]  And I tell you, it's not about being on a diet.
[02:28:46.532 --> 02:28:49.474]  There's a whole section in this book that talks about popular diets.
[02:28:49.594 --> 02:28:53.636]  The paleo, the vegan, the vegetarian, the low-fat, the low-calorie, the gluten-free.
[02:28:54.056 --> 02:28:58.918]  And I show you, if you don't follow these principles, you will have pitfalls if you're on one of those diets.
[02:28:59.198 --> 02:29:14.164]  And I show you exactly what to look out for, where you can be exposed to some of these... Well, I've only scanned over your book, but I mean, as I was saying, I cannot wait to read it, because it's got all these graphs, all these documents, all the facts, really easy to follow.
[02:29:15.256 --> 02:29:19.417]  How things work, warning about food dyes, artificial natural flavors.
[02:29:19.437 --> 02:29:21.157]  It's got a huge bibliography.
[02:29:21.217 --> 02:29:23.618]  I mean, you've really done yeoman's work here.
[02:29:24.178 --> 02:29:27.899]  Everyone should get the food, babe, because here's the bottom line.
[02:29:29.099 --> 02:29:34.260]  The fact that they're coming out of the woodwork against you is because the system is striking back.
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:35.881]  But I'm here to tell the establishment something.
[02:29:36.361 --> 02:29:38.481]  The revolution of markets is here.
[02:29:39.021 --> 02:29:41.542]  People know how to vote with their dollars, their euros.
[02:29:42.643 --> 02:29:49.188]  They're yens, they're yans, they're rubles, and they're not voting for your GMO poison food.
[02:29:49.208 --> 02:29:54.131]  And we have a right to eat the food we want, and so go ahead and try to destroy the food, babe.
[02:29:54.391 --> 02:29:55.552]  It'll only make her bigger.
[02:29:55.792 --> 02:29:57.994]  We've all got to stick together or hang separate.
[02:29:58.014 --> 02:29:58.494]  Stay with us.
[02:29:58.854 --> 02:29:59.755]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.235 --> 02:30:01.836]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.757 --> 02:30:05.439]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.014 --> 02:30:13.056]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[02:30:13.396 --> 02:30:16.658]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[02:30:16.899 --> 02:30:22.883]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[02:30:22.983 --> 02:30:24.143]  I'm all about human potential.
[02:30:24.364 --> 02:30:26.505]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[02:30:26.525 --> 02:30:28.106]  The establishment is the opposite.
[02:30:28.166 --> 02:30:32.709]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[02:30:32.949 --> 02:30:37.312]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[02:30:37.552 --> 02:30:39.834]  How we can come together and win the human race.

[02:31:10.044 --> 02:31:13.245]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[02:33:15.540 --> 02:33:21.165]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[02:33:21.625 --> 02:33:22.606]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:33:22.987 --> 02:33:29.933]  Infowars.com, yeah.
[02:33:30.153 --> 02:33:36.458]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:36.819 --> 02:33:40.322]  I tell you, you gotta listen to Alex Jones.
[02:33:41.983 --> 02:33:43.904]  We first aired that like two years ago.
[02:33:44.004 --> 02:33:46.605]  We interviewed Mike Judge for the TV show.
[02:33:48.566 --> 02:33:51.388]  People thought that it was it was it was fake.
[02:33:51.728 --> 02:33:52.628]  It's just just hilarious.
[02:33:53.289 --> 02:33:54.429]  No, I'm good friends with Mike Judge.
[02:33:54.449 --> 02:33:57.271]  He's a listener and it just shows he's been a listener for
[02:33:58.803 --> 02:34:00.424]  Twenty years since I was first on air.
[02:34:00.984 --> 02:34:02.846]  It just shows how popular freedom is.
[02:34:03.326 --> 02:34:07.789]  I've known Judge for over a decade, but we just, the last few years, got him to go on air.
[02:34:07.809 --> 02:34:09.110]  I'm going to get him back on air soon.
[02:34:09.130 --> 02:34:13.072]  And again, he can be called a liberal, a conservative, whatever.
[02:34:13.112 --> 02:34:14.273]  He's just somebody that wants to be free.
[02:34:15.523 --> 02:34:18.164]  King of the Hill, all those other big shows.
[02:34:19.664 --> 02:34:21.305]  And again, freedom is popular.
[02:34:21.345 --> 02:34:30.708]  That's why I just played that intro, is to remind people how many prominent, famous people know what's going on and are speaking out about the New World Order.
[02:34:31.815 --> 02:34:32.756]  About globalism.
[02:34:33.097 --> 02:34:34.278]  About social engineering.
[02:34:34.739 --> 02:34:45.733]  And let me tell you, if they can force inoculations in you, if they can lie and say there's no side effects of vaccines, if they can lie and say GMO is safe and effective and there's no problems, it's not true!
[02:34:47.015 --> 02:34:49.077]  And then Vani Hari, the food babe, comes along...
[02:34:50.222 --> 02:34:50.802]  She's smart.
[02:34:51.183 --> 02:34:51.983]  She's well-spoken.
[02:34:53.084 --> 02:35:03.210]  She's just been doing this particular operation just a few years from my memory, but she's doing it professionally, and so they're coming out of the woodwork against her because she's having victory on every front.
[02:35:03.691 --> 02:35:09.774]  Vani, how many companies have you gotten to list their ingredients or take known toxins out of their food?
[02:35:09.814 --> 02:35:11.936]  I mean, the list is huge now, isn't it?
[02:35:12.406 --> 02:35:13.207]  Yeah, it's dozens.
[02:35:13.367 --> 02:35:14.028]  It's dozens.
[02:35:14.268 --> 02:35:23.196]  And, um, you know, again, I don't want to take all the credit because the credit, and as you say, Alex, the credit belongs to the people, the people out there that are carrying this message.
[02:35:23.216 --> 02:35:25.578]  But you're the facilitator, the initiator.
[02:35:25.598 --> 02:35:28.501]  I mean, you're kicking the ball off is the point.
[02:35:28.601 --> 02:35:30.983]  And so you're a focal point, a spokesperson.
[02:35:31.244 --> 02:35:32.265]  And so they're going to come after you.
[02:35:32.861 --> 02:35:33.862]  Yes, they are.
[02:35:34.042 --> 02:35:35.283]  And you know what's really interesting?
[02:35:35.323 --> 02:35:39.967]  I was talking last night, I had my book launch party here in New York City and it was an amazing night.
[02:35:40.007 --> 02:35:46.912]  It was a full crowd and so packed and I got to meet so many members of the Food Babe Army that are out there fighting for a better food system.
[02:35:47.013 --> 02:35:52.437]  And while I was there, you know, someone had asked me a question like, what can we do if we're a blogger
[02:35:52.517 --> 02:35:54.258]  If we're out there, we're trying to support you.
[02:35:54.298 --> 02:35:56.960]  What can we do when we encounter these attacks?
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:02.684]  Because so many people are attacking my personal friends, their Facebook pages, their articles.
[02:36:02.824 --> 02:36:09.149]  Even on your site, on InfoWars' Facebook page, I saw them attacking me again in there.
[02:36:09.549 --> 02:36:18.376]  And so what I want... Oh, it's a definite paid campaign, just like they attack anybody that denies their other propaganda operations.
[02:36:18.396 --> 02:36:18.676]  Go ahead.
[02:36:19.451 --> 02:36:25.255]  Well, you know, they're organized and they share things on their pages and they go, look at this, go there now.
[02:36:25.415 --> 02:36:31.239]  And so they leave like 16 comments in a row that are all negative saying basically the same thing about me.
[02:36:31.279 --> 02:36:31.919]  And you know what?
[02:36:32.340 --> 02:36:42.326]  This is not something that I'm going to stay quiet about because for so long, women especially have stayed quiet about being trolled and being cyberbullied and getting death threats and rape threats.
[02:36:42.646 --> 02:36:44.588]  And I'm tired of staying quiet about it.
[02:36:44.688 --> 02:36:45.208]  And you know what?
[02:36:45.288 --> 02:36:46.209]  It needs to stop.
[02:36:46.269 --> 02:36:49.291]  And I'm going to be speaking about it even more as it continues to happen.
[02:36:49.471 --> 02:36:49.971]  Absolutely!
[02:36:50.051 --> 02:37:00.215]  I mean, take their attacks and show what bullies and scum they are, that we simply want a right to know what's in our food, and they're trying to bully activists and women into submission.
[02:37:00.255 --> 02:37:12.880]  The answer is to support you and then to post links to facts backing you up, but then to redouble sending your links and our links and this video out to people not responding to the trolls.
[02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:27.503]  Because they just want to change the subject into a debate about you and how you're bad, instead of, hey, look at the documents about what GMO did, or look at the success we're having, you know, getting labeling, or they are scared of the success.
[02:37:27.543 --> 02:37:30.444]  They want to shut the success down and change the subject.
[02:37:30.684 --> 02:37:35.805]  So I would advise you, folks, just put out positive comments and share our information and her information.
[02:37:36.265 --> 02:37:39.066]  Don't even respond to the trolls, is what I've experienced.
[02:37:39.622 --> 02:37:45.484]  That's right, and I also want people to have enough courage not to be share-shamed by these people.
[02:37:45.824 --> 02:37:54.226]  You know, one of the things that's really upset me about this movement is there's so many great leaders in this movement that are really bringing the forefront of information.
[02:37:54.366 --> 02:37:58.087]  Our friend, Dr. Mercola, the people at Natural News, all of these people.
[02:37:58.127 --> 02:38:02.109]  When I share links from some of these sites, people share-shame me.
[02:38:02.189 --> 02:38:03.549]  They say, why are you doing this?
[02:38:03.609 --> 02:38:05.810]  I can't believe you like Dr. Mercola.
[02:38:05.870 --> 02:38:06.350]  You know what?
[02:38:06.770 --> 02:38:10.532]  I like him because he's not scared to tell the truth when it needs to be told.
[02:38:11.012 --> 02:38:20.016]  And he also is, it doesn't mean that I believe everything he believes, and it doesn't mean that you believe everything I believe, Alex, for having me on your show.
[02:38:20.396 --> 02:38:26.359]  You are supportive of this message that I'm talking about today, and I'm supportive of messages that I share.
[02:38:26.459 --> 02:38:29.701]  What they want to do is break up any unity, any groups getting together.
[02:38:29.961 --> 02:38:31.302]  They want to keep it left-right.
[02:38:31.623 --> 02:38:32.903]  They want to keep it balkanized.
[02:38:33.284 --> 02:38:43.611]  They want to set the parameters of who can talk to who because they have tiny audiences, their coalitions are shrinking, they're losing the war because we have justice on our side.
[02:38:44.127 --> 02:38:46.568]  Yeah, and you know, I'm tired of the share-shaming.
[02:38:46.628 --> 02:38:58.995]  So you can use that as a hashtag, share-shame anybody, but like stop the share-shaming because really it is about making sure that we are comfortable and we're courageous and we stand up for the truth no matter what.
[02:38:59.295 --> 02:39:04.597]  And I tell you right now, if you're going to share-shame me, you're not going to be a member of the Food Babe Army because you know what?
[02:39:04.617 --> 02:39:11.341]  The information that I'm going to share and put out there on my Facebook pages and on my blog are meant to help the world.
[02:39:11.561 --> 02:39:11.661]  Well...
[02:39:27.930 --> 02:39:35.234]  Because most of them are paid or part of coalitions that are paid by industry to keep this whole program going on.
[02:39:35.534 --> 02:39:46.620]  If we ever demand to see what's in our food, if we ever demand to know what's in the vaccines, if we ever demand to know what's going on with serious issues like pollution, it's game over for the establishment.
[02:39:46.660 --> 02:39:53.464]  They want to change the subject to carbon dioxide and tax that, but not worry about GMO or overfishing or
[02:39:54.464 --> 02:39:56.227]  Nanotech, or any of the real threats.
[02:39:56.708 --> 02:40:00.034]  And so, you're a really sweet person, you're a smart person.
[02:40:00.074 --> 02:40:01.135]  How many years have you been doing this?
[02:40:02.581 --> 02:40:03.602]  Um, less than four.
[02:40:03.862 --> 02:40:05.262]  Okay, less than four.
[02:40:05.963 --> 02:40:21.049]  So you, you're smart, you're beautiful, you're well-spoken, they're scared of you, and so just some advice from somebody who's been doing this for 20 years, and I can learn a lot from you as well, I would just ignore the detractors or I would really try to stir them up.
[02:40:21.109 --> 02:40:21.870]  I'd go either way.
[02:40:22.250 --> 02:40:28.073]  Either ignore them or love it and try to stir them up because any publicity is good publicity and
[02:40:29.073 --> 02:40:34.016]  They're going to lose criticizing somebody that just wants people to have choices and to know what's in their food.
[02:40:34.197 --> 02:40:41.141]  Everybody knows we're the most obese, most unhealthy, and that America's circling the toilet bowl, and I hate to use a gross analogy.
[02:40:41.621 --> 02:40:45.764]  And so, I found being attacked is a badge of courage.
[02:40:46.144 --> 02:40:48.146]  These people don't control the narrative anymore.
[02:40:48.466 --> 02:40:51.628]  So I just personally don't let it get to you.
[02:40:52.008 --> 02:40:58.653]  Feel good about this, because they have an old saying from bombardiers in World War II and B-17s and other bombers.
[02:40:59.093 --> 02:40:59.173]  Yes.
[02:41:16.130 --> 02:41:27.473]  Celebrating the fact that they're threatening to rape you, showing how desperate and afraid they are, and then just saying, I'm not afraid of you, we're having victory, and we salute everyone that's taking action.
[02:41:27.773 --> 02:41:33.975]  They're scared, and the fact that you're getting that much flack is a real badge, blue ribbon, of victory.
[02:41:34.949 --> 02:41:38.031]  And you know, the thing is, I'm not the only person getting it.
[02:41:38.111 --> 02:41:40.173]  There are other people in this movement that are getting it.
[02:41:40.253 --> 02:41:43.476]  And if you're one of the people listening out there and you're getting it, I want to hear from you.
[02:41:43.536 --> 02:41:44.236]  Because you know what?
[02:41:45.217 --> 02:41:49.801]  I want to help support other people in this industry that are trying to fight for a healthier world.
[02:41:50.161 --> 02:41:53.343]  I'm not about censoring my message.
[02:41:54.224 --> 02:41:54.384]  I don't
[02:42:12.039 --> 02:42:13.040]  Really amazing stories.
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:18.703]  One of the ones that you just linked to earlier in the show was Living Maxwell's article.
[02:42:19.163 --> 02:42:24.846]  He encourages the media to start talking to the scientists that are speaking out about these food chemicals.
[02:42:25.186 --> 02:42:31.790]  He's listed all the research on the major chemicals that we've discussed on foodbabe.com and all the science behind it.
[02:42:32.370 --> 02:42:39.818]  It really, really is interesting when the media decides to only interview the people who are the most vocal and not the people who are the most concerned.
[02:42:40.158 --> 02:42:50.969]  And really, there are a lot of concerned scientists about what's happening with these food chemicals, how they've gone largely unregulated, how they've gone from 800 to 10,000 now, and we need to take a step back
[02:42:51.049 --> 02:42:52.690]  Well sure, let's expand on this.
[02:42:53.191 --> 02:42:56.633]  Cigarettes, we now know, it's come out in all the court cases.
[02:42:56.693 --> 02:42:58.234]  Some of them had over 300 additives.
[02:42:58.814 --> 02:43:00.356]  It was designed to addict you.
[02:43:00.736 --> 02:43:01.777]  The chemicals were there.
[02:43:01.797 --> 02:43:06.120]  Well obviously if they're putting hundreds of chemicals in tobacco, it's a drug.
[02:43:06.540 --> 02:43:07.441]  It's like crack.
[02:43:07.501 --> 02:43:09.042]  It's not classical tobacco.
[02:43:10.479 --> 02:43:13.440]  And it all came out that it was a conspiracy.
[02:43:13.540 --> 02:43:14.601]  It was premeditated.
[02:43:15.121 --> 02:43:19.722]  Well, the very same lawyers that worked for Big Tobacco now work for Big GMO and Big Oil.
[02:43:20.603 --> 02:43:23.424]  And there is a program to put this in our food.
[02:43:23.544 --> 02:43:24.964]  Nobody else puts up with this.
[02:43:25.364 --> 02:43:27.345]  It's killing us, and we're sorry.
[02:43:27.865 --> 02:43:29.146]  Killing us is over.
[02:43:29.186 --> 02:43:34.488]  We're not going to drink your GMO milk so that our kids are a foot taller than they should be and get cancer when they're 20.
[02:43:35.745 --> 02:43:38.067]  We're going to expose the tainted vaccines.
[02:43:38.387 --> 02:43:39.809]  We're going to expose fluoride.
[02:43:39.829 --> 02:43:41.550]  It's in Harvard Studies, brain damaging people.
[02:43:41.790 --> 02:43:43.912]  You can put tenfold hats on us all day.
[02:43:44.272 --> 02:43:45.774]  It doesn't work anymore.
[02:43:46.094 --> 02:43:47.315]  So that's what it comes down to.
[02:43:47.355 --> 02:43:51.078]  Everybody should vote for food safety.
[02:43:51.599 --> 02:43:54.401]  Look, they're scared of you because you're smart and a good spokesperson.
[02:43:54.501 --> 02:43:57.203]  If your book hits it big, it could be the
[02:43:58.579 --> 02:44:02.101]  New Jungle, you know, that changes food processing and child welfare.
[02:44:02.482 --> 02:44:09.266]  It could be the new Uncle Tom's Cabin that changed people's minds about slavery in the North.
[02:44:10.466 --> 02:44:11.327]  But it might not be you.
[02:44:11.387 --> 02:44:18.251]  It could be some other activist, some other person taking action, or someone that takes things we've done to be successful and duplicates it, or what you've done.
[02:44:18.451 --> 02:44:23.815]  They're scared of independent PR people guided by truth and justice
[02:44:24.515 --> 02:44:32.247]  Not by corporate money like you and I. So they're scared of our archetype more than they're scared of us.
[02:44:32.607 --> 02:44:38.055]  So they want to destroy us so that they discourage other people from ever taking the field.
[02:44:39.454 --> 02:44:40.755]  Yeah, they really do.
[02:44:41.055 --> 02:44:41.876]  And you know what?
[02:44:42.056 --> 02:44:42.776]  Thank goodness.
[02:44:42.856 --> 02:44:53.543]  I don't know where I got all this courage and this passion, but I think it's really because of my health story and knowing that I don't want anybody to ever feel like I used to.
[02:44:53.563 --> 02:44:56.305]  I want to do whatever I can to prevent that.
[02:44:56.505 --> 02:45:10.737]  Well, I know you have tears in your eyes right now because you're on a good crusade, a healthy crusade, and I just want to say you should be ashamed having free speech in America and losing all that weight and getting healthy and having all the success getting toxic chemicals out of children's food.
[02:45:10.757 --> 02:45:21.086]  You know, how dare people like you, moms mainly, that exposed bisphenol A hurting their children, you can now go to Walmart or Target and find plastic and things that don't have it.
[02:45:21.427 --> 02:45:24.029]  How dare you people be part of the
[02:45:24.489 --> 02:45:25.970]  Organic food revolution.
[02:45:26.210 --> 02:45:31.975]  How dare people like you be part of local farm revolution that's helping bring back farming in some areas?
[02:45:32.335 --> 02:45:34.717]  How dare you engage in free speech?
[02:45:35.257 --> 02:45:41.001]  You just need to shut up and people need to not read your book The Food Babe Way and Infowarsstore.com.
[02:45:41.401 --> 02:45:43.263]  I want you to apologize right now.
[02:45:43.463 --> 02:45:44.864]  What do you think this is a free country?
[02:45:45.044 --> 02:45:45.925]  How dare you?
[02:45:49.281 --> 02:45:50.582]  That's what they're saying, Alex.
[02:45:50.882 --> 02:45:52.823]  Well, it's because they're good people and you're bad.
[02:45:53.083 --> 02:45:55.124]  Listen, seriously, great job, Vani Hari.
[02:45:55.324 --> 02:45:56.625]  Hope to talk to you again soon.
[02:45:56.645 --> 02:45:57.225]  God bless you.
[02:45:58.085 --> 02:45:58.726]  Thank you so much.
[02:45:59.046 --> 02:46:00.587]  Alright, there she goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:00.727 --> 02:46:01.747]  Very nice lady.
[02:46:02.127 --> 02:46:02.888]  And they're scared of her.
[02:46:03.608 --> 02:46:05.449]  She's very beautiful and very well spoken.
[02:46:05.749 --> 02:46:06.870]  And she's got the truth on her side.
[02:46:07.290 --> 02:46:08.811]  And she's another light in the darkness.
[02:46:08.831 --> 02:46:12.453]  Just one more person that notice we're standing beside and behind.
[02:46:13.653 --> 02:46:15.994]  Just like we expect to be defended when we're attacked.
[02:46:16.134 --> 02:46:17.115]  But I'll be quite frank with you.
[02:46:19.699 --> 02:46:31.400]  I don't want people attacking me in YouTube and Infowars and CNN and everywhere else from below and above and from all sides to make you run off and defend me because that's just meant to get you diverted off mission.
[02:46:32.799 --> 02:46:35.842]  Get our videos about serious topics out to everybody.
[02:46:36.342 --> 02:46:37.783]  Get our articles out.
[02:46:38.164 --> 02:46:39.144]  That's what you promote.
[02:46:39.184 --> 02:46:40.205]  You don't defend me.
[02:46:40.566 --> 02:46:41.867]  I'm here to be attacked.
[02:46:42.187 --> 02:46:44.149]  I'm here to be destroyed, if need be.
[02:46:44.429 --> 02:46:44.729]  Okay?
[02:46:45.049 --> 02:46:46.711]  I mean, don't think I don't know that.
[02:46:47.551 --> 02:46:51.975]  I'm here, though, to take the flak, and then behind that, we can roll the info in.
[02:46:51.995 --> 02:46:52.516]  You understand that?
[02:46:52.856 --> 02:46:58.761]  I'm here to say things that I know are true, but said in a way that the enemy will take it like bait and attack.
[02:46:59.521 --> 02:46:59.982]  You understand?
[02:47:01.351 --> 02:47:04.254]  I'm meant to go in, take enemy fire to show their positions.
[02:47:04.834 --> 02:47:09.298]  And then you just roll in behind that and just keep waking people up and taking action.
[02:47:09.678 --> 02:47:11.500]  You can see the divide and conquer tactics.
[02:47:11.820 --> 02:47:12.521]  Black, black, black.
[02:47:12.561 --> 02:47:13.182]  White, white, white.
[02:47:13.222 --> 02:47:13.962]  Jew, Jew, Jew.
[02:47:14.363 --> 02:47:14.963]  This, this, this.
[02:47:15.043 --> 02:47:17.125]  Balkanize, balkanize, balkanize everywhere.
[02:47:18.286 --> 02:47:19.167]  Man versus woman.
[02:47:19.187 --> 02:47:20.428]  On and on and on and on again.
[02:47:20.908 --> 02:47:22.670]  Balkanize, balkanize, confuse.
[02:47:23.070 --> 02:47:24.612]  That's all the enemy's got.
[02:47:26.349 --> 02:47:28.571]  Most people in the system are compartmentalized.
[02:47:29.051 --> 02:47:32.834]  Once they hear this broadcast and go, yeah, I don't want to be part of this, it's game over.
[02:47:34.235 --> 02:47:39.358]  So, again, I wouldn't even spend, you can defend her if you want or whatever.
[02:47:39.579 --> 02:47:41.040]  She's been doing this four years, she's smart.
[02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:46.644]  I think she should just keep putting scientific facts out and say, I'm glad I'm being attacked, it means I'm having a big effect.
[02:47:47.024 --> 02:47:51.427]  Now, I want to go to Mesha, Aaron, Elizabeth, Michael, get to all of you.
[02:47:51.467 --> 02:47:53.468]  Mike's up next, but first, Steve.
[02:47:54.617 --> 02:47:57.700]  Holding over, we gotta combine his call back with the earlier part.
[02:47:58.620 --> 02:48:02.723]  Amazing stories about secret helicopters, silent helicopter aircraft.
[02:48:03.704 --> 02:48:08.388]  Used to people would see the Night Stalkers out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky flying around the neighborhoods.
[02:48:08.408 --> 02:48:09.529]  The media would say it didn't exist.
[02:48:09.569 --> 02:48:10.850]  Now they admit all that goes on.
[02:48:11.671 --> 02:48:13.972]  But he had another story about the Rule of Three.
[02:48:14.373 --> 02:48:16.294]  So go ahead and tell us what you were told in the Navy.
[02:48:16.334 --> 02:48:16.654]  Go ahead.
[02:48:17.815 --> 02:48:18.776]  Okay.
[02:48:18.976 --> 02:48:20.477]  Briefly, I'll mention it.
[02:48:21.567 --> 02:48:22.608]  The Rule of Threes.
[02:48:22.668 --> 02:48:24.549]  Why they taught me this, I have no idea.
[02:48:24.609 --> 02:48:28.551]  But most military people will talk about the Rule of Threes.
[02:48:28.591 --> 02:48:37.876]  Three minutes without air, three hours without shelter, three days without water, three weeks without food, three months without human interaction, and any one of those will kill you.
[02:48:38.217 --> 02:48:45.181]  But what they taught me in addition was three days to... It's very complex.
[02:48:45.261 --> 02:48:49.183]  I will say that it's very extensive, but I'll just mention a couple of them.
[02:48:49.642 --> 02:48:52.885]  Three days to establish a perimeter, and I'll just give one example of it.
[02:48:53.265 --> 02:48:55.347]  I remember when the Boston bombing went off.
[02:48:56.488 --> 02:49:01.313]  I was leaving work, and I heard about it actually at work.
[02:49:02.089 --> 02:49:11.135]  And, uh, when I got home, my wife and I, we rarely watch television, but, uh, we were watching TV that night because I was, uh, wanted to see what had happened.
[02:49:11.575 --> 02:49:17.820]  And as I had seen it, um, I sat there and, and while it was going on, I told my wife about the rule of threes.
[02:49:17.920 --> 02:49:21.702]  I told her, I said, they're going to establish a permit around Boston within three days.
[02:49:22.163 --> 02:49:24.384]  And I just sat there and decided it all off.
[02:49:24.444 --> 02:49:28.627]  And she looked at me from the other side of the sofa, like, who is this guy beside me?
[02:49:29.247 --> 02:49:31.729]  And, um, the first rule is this the first day.
[02:49:32.129 --> 02:49:36.090]  The main three ways, or travel ways, are shut down.
[02:49:36.150 --> 02:49:40.891]  Freeways, airports, ports of call, and rail.
[02:49:41.211 --> 02:49:44.972]  The second day they shut down secondary escape routes and natural barriers.
[02:49:45.052 --> 02:49:52.214]  That's right, when the major collapse comes, or a nuke goes off in a major city and they bring in martial law, you got three days to get out of Dodge.
[02:49:53.274 --> 02:49:56.314]  No, you actually have two, because by the third day it's shut down.
[02:49:59.005 --> 02:50:01.247]  And it goes even more thorough.
[02:50:01.287 --> 02:50:07.432]  It talks about, you know, like, evasion, predator-prey, like, how a deer runs.
[02:50:07.872 --> 02:50:21.903]  A deer will run until it's exhausted, whereas a rabbit will return to its home or return wherever... I mean, if you've ever gone hunting... I'm a hillbilly from Ohio, so I mean, when we go hunting, I mean, different animals react different ways.
[02:50:22.363 --> 02:50:23.684]  So, you hunt them differently.
[02:50:24.044 --> 02:50:27.727]  And most people have lost that skill or have no idea about it.
[02:50:28.331 --> 02:50:33.129]  But I mean, I mean, like, an example would be freeway.
[02:50:34.830 --> 02:50:37.671]  But the rule of three goes into three perimeters being set.
[02:50:37.731 --> 02:50:42.292]  And if you look on any freeway that you go on, you have a fence on both sides.
[02:50:42.732 --> 02:50:45.413]  Whether people realize it or not, most people think they're private.
[02:50:45.493 --> 02:50:48.014]  It's all been set up to control everything.
[02:50:48.034 --> 02:50:48.494]  Yeah.
[02:50:48.594 --> 02:50:49.955]  Listen, you're an interesting fella.
[02:50:49.995 --> 02:50:56.137]  I'd like to make contact with you, document who you say you are, and then have you on to talk about those secret aircrafts and things.
[02:50:56.417 --> 02:50:59.878]  There's a lot of that's now been released and open, but not fully, fully talked about.
[02:51:00.238 --> 02:51:03.259]  I'm going to get your name and number if you like and get you on the nightly news sometime.
[02:51:03.299 --> 02:51:03.899]  Thank you so much.
[02:51:04.120 --> 02:51:07.416]  We're going to come back and talk to Mike, Elizabeth, Aaron, Mesha and others.

[02:52:11.618 --> 02:52:20.041]  I was concerned about my cholesterol readings because I knew that high cholesterol is related to clogging of the arteries and increases the risk for heart attack and stroke.
[02:52:20.481 --> 02:52:26.142]  One day, I heard an ad for Heart and Body Extract and I was skeptical, but I decided to give it a try.

[02:54:12.319 --> 02:54:18.363]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:54:18.983 --> 02:54:21.985]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:23.005 --> 02:54:25.247]  We've had many YouTube channels and still do.
[02:54:25.267 --> 02:54:27.188]  I never thought to call on the Alex Jones Channel.
[02:54:27.748 --> 02:54:37.574]  But it was back in February 11, 2008, that a fella out in Oregon decided to create the channel and start posting clips of the show.
[02:54:38.871 --> 02:54:40.153]  Dave Thomas is his name.
[02:54:40.213 --> 02:54:42.595]  No, he's not the deceased guy from Wendy's.
[02:54:43.817 --> 02:54:55.750]  And now, I don't know, four, five, six years later, 2015 hasn't really elapsed much yet, so that's four years, five, about six years ago, we started the Alex Jones Channel.
[02:54:57.220 --> 02:54:57.560]  474,454,879 views.
[02:54:57.920 --> 02:55:09.364]  Now if you count all of our other official channels together, it's about 600 million views.
[02:55:09.844 --> 02:55:19.928]  Then if you add some major fan channels together, we're talking about... I don't know, what is that?
[02:55:20.068 --> 02:55:22.529]  I mean, do the math on that, over a billion views?
[02:55:25.029 --> 02:55:29.791]  That's just one platform, YouTube, that's probably 10% of our audience?
[02:55:31.972 --> 02:55:33.393]  That's the fact.
[02:55:34.173 --> 02:55:35.894]  We are the real media.
[02:55:36.614 --> 02:55:37.914]  The old media is collapsing.
[02:55:37.934 --> 02:55:39.495]  Brian Williams is just a sign of that.
[02:55:39.795 --> 02:55:44.457]  That's why movies and drama shows, cop shows and stuff, that's where the real propaganda's at.
[02:55:45.538 --> 02:55:53.221]  And I've told my crew, and myself is included, I haven't really done it yet, we need to focus more on entertainment and analyzing it, and propaganda.
[02:55:54.346 --> 02:55:56.027]  Thanks Alex, how are you today?
[02:56:21.128 --> 02:56:23.530]  So yeah, I wanted to talk about education and debt.
[02:56:24.911 --> 02:56:25.931]  I'm in law school right now.
[02:56:26.432 --> 02:56:28.493]  I want to just tell you briefly my story.
[02:56:28.993 --> 02:56:32.456]  I had to take out a lot of loans just to pay for undergrad.
[02:56:32.816 --> 02:56:36.538]  Credit cards just to cover costs, you know, stealing from Peter to pay Paul.
[02:56:37.599 --> 02:56:46.925]  I ended up graduating with my degree in political science, but after that it was a struggle because nothing was hiring, so I had the options of
[02:56:47.580 --> 02:56:50.263]  You know, going to work for a bank, which I obviously didn't want to do.
[02:56:50.283 --> 02:56:53.426]  So I had to take low-paying jobs just to, like, get by.
[02:56:54.387 --> 02:56:57.170]  So I said, you know, I have to just make some moves here.
[02:56:57.231 --> 02:57:00.955]  So I decided to go to law school because it was really my only option.
[02:57:02.156 --> 02:57:09.404]  And so the problem is, though, that after I graduate, I'm finding that I'm going to end up having close to a quarter of a million dollars in student debt.
[02:57:09.984 --> 02:57:13.187]  And, you know, this is a big deal because a lot of my friends are the same way.
[02:57:13.527 --> 02:57:14.568]  Well, here's another problem.
[02:57:14.588 --> 02:57:24.217]  There's such a mega-massive glut of lawyers and other people now that they're now passing laws just to give the lawyers a chance to sue everybody, and it's just destroying the economy.
[02:57:26.505 --> 02:57:28.126]  Yeah, I mean, I'm going for different reasons.
[02:57:28.146 --> 02:57:32.169]  I'm going for, like, environmental and, you know, trying to actually do some good public interest.
[02:57:32.449 --> 02:57:34.110]  Oh, I'm not saying every lawyer is bad.
[02:57:34.130 --> 02:57:39.794]  I mean, the fact that we've got all these lawyers is an expression of our society, and you certainly need a lawyer to battle the other bad lawyers.
[02:57:39.834 --> 02:57:43.776]  So, I'm not saying you're bad to want to go into the law, but I hear you.
[02:57:43.817 --> 02:57:46.058]  The whole thing's a bubble designed to screw everybody over.
[02:57:46.538 --> 02:57:49.500]  Imagine what healthcare has turned into with government involvement.
[02:57:49.820 --> 02:57:51.702]  Now it's going to be expanded under Obamacare.
[02:57:51.982 --> 02:57:53.323]  Imagine what healthcare is going to be like.
[02:57:55.544 --> 02:57:56.625]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:57:56.725 --> 02:58:05.913]  And you know, and the thing is, too though, is that I'm finding that when people are so in debt, I'm finding that it's like a debt slavery that I'm finding myself going to be in.
[02:58:06.234 --> 02:58:08.276]  Especially looking at the payments that I'm going to have to make.
[02:58:08.836 --> 02:58:11.659]  And you know, it's going to be... Well, you know what my answer is?
[02:58:11.699 --> 02:58:12.900]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[02:58:12.940 --> 02:58:17.644]  Whenever I'm challenged with anything that's real or factual, exposing the system, it doesn't exist.
[02:58:18.185 --> 02:58:19.426]  Educations are a great deal.
[02:58:19.446 --> 02:58:20.386]  They're not overpriced.
[02:58:21.267 --> 02:58:31.663]  And football's all that matters, and Obama loves us, and you should turn your guns in, and you should take all the vaccines, eat all the GMO, and eat all the preservatives.
[02:58:32.123 --> 02:58:32.804]  It's good for you.
[02:58:33.664 --> 02:58:36.525]  Giving your kid a bunch of preservatives, they act real bad afterwards and get sick?
[02:58:36.565 --> 02:58:37.546]  Well, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:58:38.206 --> 02:58:40.507]  Give your kid a shot, they have a convulsion, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:58:40.907 --> 02:58:42.788]  In fact, any opinion is racist.
[02:58:43.348 --> 02:58:46.930]  We're gonna go to break, come back with Elizabeth and others straight ahead in overdrive.
[02:58:47.250 --> 02:58:49.551]  InfoWars.com.org slash show to find the free feed.

[02:58:59.528 --> 02:59:03.030]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:59:03.190 --> 02:59:07.152]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:59:07.472 --> 02:59:08.933]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:59:09.253 --> 02:59:16.837]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[02:59:32.547 --> 02:59:40.553]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[03:00:08.738 --> 03:00:14.499]  This transmission is coming to you.
[03:00:14.580 --> 03:00:16.680]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:18.920 --> 03:00:24.662]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:25.622 --> 03:00:29.023]  There's a lot of crazy stuff I didn't get to, like this headline.
[03:00:29.063 --> 03:00:35.264]  China may arm Hawaiian independence movement, possible overture in response to US arming Taiwan.
[03:00:36.144 --> 03:00:37.886]  That's Bill Gertz reporting on that.
[03:00:38.687 --> 03:00:39.868]  The Washington Free Beacon.
[03:00:40.328 --> 03:00:41.749]  Stories on Infowars.com.
[03:00:41.809 --> 03:00:43.031]  Curt Nemo elaborates on it.
[03:00:43.471 --> 03:00:45.453]  I mean, stuff's just getting Twilight Zone right now.
[03:00:45.993 --> 03:00:48.536]  Elizabeth in California, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:00:50.109 --> 03:00:57.913]  Hi Alex, I ran across some astonishing information on YouTube regarding the Ukrainian explosion, and I don't think it's received enough publicity.
[03:00:58.053 --> 03:01:11.659]  And what it is, is that about five hours after the explosion, if you slow down the video during Madonna's Grammy performance, there's an image of a nuclear explosion that looks like eerily like the images of the Ukrainian explosion.
[03:01:12.579 --> 03:01:30.789]  And I'm not saying that Americans are responsible for the explosion, but for those of us researchers who are aware of the history of occultic and ritualistic aspects of the nuclear program, it does appear that Western occultists may have been aware of this event in advance and that Madonna's performance was part of the ritual.
[03:01:31.610 --> 03:01:35.852]  And I also don't think it was any coincidence that Annie Lennox sang, I Put a Spell on You.
[03:01:37.216 --> 03:01:44.022]  Well, I mean, that sounds crazy to a new listener, but the Globalists do like to do big public rituals showing what they're going to do later.
[03:01:44.102 --> 03:01:45.303]  They believe it gives them more power.
[03:01:45.323 --> 03:01:46.324]  They're really into it.
[03:01:47.465 --> 03:01:48.646]  It's ritualistic magic.
[03:01:48.726 --> 03:01:50.107]  Lesser magic is what they call it.
[03:01:50.908 --> 03:01:56.833]  They do the lesser magic before the official event, and stranger things have happened, but I'll have to look into it.
[03:01:56.853 --> 03:01:57.653]  Thank you so much.
[03:01:58.354 --> 03:02:05.320]  There's no doubt every Super Bowl event I've seen for over a decade is an occultic ritual at halftime.
[03:02:06.690 --> 03:02:09.072]  I mean it just goes on and on and on.
[03:02:09.512 --> 03:02:11.194]  The people running things are mentally ill.
[03:02:12.254 --> 03:02:14.516]  Mesha in Illinois, thanks for holding, you're on the air.
[03:02:14.536 --> 03:02:17.839]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:02:18.439 --> 03:02:33.972]  I'm calling about a report I saw from Nevada in a local news station where the Nevada DMV was saying they're calling for a national ID to fly domestically.
[03:02:35.586 --> 03:02:40.230]  Well, that's what our ID cards are, and now they're coming out with a North American Hemisphere card.
[03:02:40.270 --> 03:02:43.753]  Well, they already have it out, but they're saying they're going to basically do away with IDs.
[03:02:44.354 --> 03:02:47.736]  State IDs are already federal IDs, basically.
[03:02:48.637 --> 03:02:55.923]  But the TSA is just basically going to expand down and is expanding down to be basically political minders.
[03:02:56.906 --> 03:03:01.629]  And you'll have to go through them to get an authorization, even have an ID, or to travel, period.
[03:03:02.009 --> 03:03:03.450]  Had to have a driver's license, anything.
[03:03:03.770 --> 03:03:08.674]  That'll be the federal, kind of janitorial level, control freak system.
[03:03:11.315 --> 03:03:15.178]  I have another comment concerning, I don't want to, you know,
[03:03:16.092 --> 03:03:20.054]  Yeah, what's wrong with having army PSYOP commanders that are running satanic ops?
[03:03:20.094 --> 03:03:20.614]  He's a good guy.
[03:03:45.185 --> 03:03:45.485]  Question.
[03:03:45.725 --> 03:03:45.985]  Yeah.
[03:03:46.065 --> 03:03:46.465]  Helpful.
[03:03:46.665 --> 03:03:46.865]  Yeah.
[03:03:48.046 --> 03:03:50.726]  And, um, there was, I was on his web center.
[03:03:50.746 --> 03:04:06.049]  Fortunately, I didn't save the photo or the, uh, the drawing, but you know, when you're reporting earlier or before about the, um, unregistered, uh, cell phone towers and how they, uh, how they have the same, uh, they put up a similar frequency to, uh, you know, the human mind.
[03:04:06.069 --> 03:04:10.050]  Um, there's a, there's a drawing with a demonic,
[03:04:10.839 --> 03:04:14.620]  Well, that's what good guys are into.
[03:04:14.680 --> 03:04:17.861]  He's a very helpful, loving individual.
[03:04:35.900 --> 03:04:37.182]  I'm being sarcastic, of course.
[03:04:37.242 --> 03:04:38.964]  No, I mean, it's all about ending free will.
[03:04:39.345 --> 03:04:41.968]  That's what all the smart meters and all this garbage is about.
[03:04:42.028 --> 03:04:42.769]  I read DARPA.
[03:04:43.650 --> 03:04:45.192]  It was in an article in the...
[03:04:46.861 --> 03:04:56.169]  In a Maryland paper, the Baltimore Sun, like 16, 17 years ago, read it on air a bunch, saying, oh yeah, we are practicing with cell towers to put out waves to calm the public.
[03:04:56.209 --> 03:04:57.370]  I mean, this is all going on.
[03:04:57.850 --> 03:04:59.612]  We're living in a twilight zone.
[03:04:59.712 --> 03:05:01.933]  Jim and Aaron, I'm sorry I'm out of time.
[03:05:01.993 --> 03:05:03.475]  Call back, I'll put you to the head of the line.
[03:05:03.855 --> 03:05:04.636]  God bless you all.
[03:05:04.716 --> 03:05:05.516]  Great job to the crew.
