[00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:09.684]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.684 --> 00:00:11.286]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.286 --> 00:00:12.827]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.827 --> 00:00:17.030]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.073]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.904 --> 00:00:45.309]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live 26 day of August transmission.
[00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:56.077]  We are going to be here for the next three hours broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:56.077 --> 00:01:11.003]  There has obviously been a dramatic, horrifying murder caught in Virginia on a live TV feed of a reporter and a cameraman by a disgruntled
[00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:20.521]  Employee or former employee who had been involved in racism lawsuits at another TV station in Florida.
[00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:23.164]  We have the research up on InfoWars.com.
[00:01:23.164 --> 00:01:27.069]  He has now reportedly just committed suicide in the last 10 minutes.
[00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:30.133]  He goes by the name Bryce Williams.
[00:01:31.363 --> 00:01:40.548]  But his real name is Vester Flanagan, and he reportedly, the police say, turned the gun on himself after a dramatic chase.
[00:01:40.548 --> 00:01:52.876]  This is just like the Charleston shooting that killed nine people, where a racist, whacked out, white person who thought a race war was beginning, was trying to start a race war, Helter Skelter style, went in and killed those people.
[00:01:53.997 --> 00:01:59.531]  This gentleman says that there was racism at this TV station because he hadn't been promoted.
[00:01:59.531 --> 00:02:01.616]  He has been tweeting that out.
[00:02:03.443 --> 00:02:05.584]  And he wanted to be an anchor on TV.
[00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:07.544]  I mean, the guy looks completely whacked out.
[00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:14.566]  He doesn't look like he could be a janitor at a TV station, much less an anchor at a TV station.
[00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:22.088]  And I'm just telling you that as a TV radio guy, he looks completely out of his mind in his Twitter photos and stuff from weeks ago.
[00:02:22.088 --> 00:02:25.009]  And he shot these people on live television.
[00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.509]  Now we have
[00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:29.711]  Footage that Fox, CNN and others aren't showing.
[00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:33.312]  I'm going to play it here because this is a culture loves violence.
[00:02:33.312 --> 00:02:36.254]  Well, it's nothing compared to shoot-em-up games.
[00:02:36.254 --> 00:02:51.381]  And he shot this footage, I guess wanting to be famous, with his cell phone, I guess an iPhone or Droid, in first-person point of view with the gun out in front of him, just like the video game Doom developed by the Pentagon to get people to dehumanize folks and shoot them.
[00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:55.868]  I'm not demonizing video games, I'm just saying that's what this culture is.
[00:02:55.868 --> 00:03:00.752]  And so many times these people are obsessed with shoot-em-up video games.
[00:03:00.752 --> 00:03:04.015]  Turns out the guy from the Charleston situation was.
[00:03:04.015 --> 00:03:11.301]  Almost all the mass shooters, they're almost always on psychotropics or amnesiacs, which we predicted with the Charleston situation, turned out he was.
[00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:17.283]  If this guy wasn't seeing a psychologist or psychiatrist, I'll eat my hat.
[00:03:17.283 --> 00:03:22.447]  It's all it takes to get rid of the inhibition and send people over the edge.
[00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:25.997]  In a big, big way.
[00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:30.198]  So we are going to be breaking all of this down.
[00:03:30.198 --> 00:03:35.159]  But right now, let's go to the footage that he was uploading live to Twitter.
[00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:39.020]  They've taken down the Twitter account, but we've saved all of his tweets.
[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.761]  One of his last tweets was, Allison made racist comments.
[00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:48.642]  And EEOC filed a report.
[00:03:48.642 --> 00:03:50.683]  So, he filed a report with the EEOC!
[00:03:51.946 --> 00:03:57.449]  That will try to fine a business for turning the lights on.
[00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:01.350]  I mean, just an unbelievable organization in my view.
[00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.571]  Unconstitutional.
[00:04:02.571 --> 00:04:08.014]  But don't worry, he filed it with them and he was exposing her
[00:04:10.165 --> 00:04:11.445]  Her racism!
[00:04:11.445 --> 00:04:25.709]  And now, how is the controlled left on CNN, MSNBC, that's been pushing organizations and groups saying, kill the cops, kill the white people, all these tweets we reported on, thousands of folks saying, time to start killing crackers.
[00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:30.790]  And don't worry, crackers are getting shot, they're getting beat up, they're getting killed, they're getting robbed, they're getting beat up in church.
[00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.031]  It's okay because they're white!
[00:04:32.811 --> 00:04:34.752]  So will this be defended?
[00:04:34.752 --> 00:04:36.253]  That he says she was racist?
[00:04:36.253 --> 00:04:37.594]  No judge, no jury.
[00:04:37.594 --> 00:04:40.616]  She gets executed, so does the... so does the cameraman.
[00:04:40.616 --> 00:04:42.678]  Because they're trying to blame the Second Amendment right now.
[00:04:42.678 --> 00:04:44.239]  This is the next big push.
[00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:46.000]  But they've got a problem.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.841]  A big problem.
[00:04:47.841 --> 00:04:55.866]  Because this guy is basically a creation, and was guaranteed pushed over the edge by the mainstream media, inciting all of this.
[00:04:55.866 --> 00:04:56.907]  I mean, they're guilty!
[00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:06.384]  The United States has called in airstrikes to stop the Taliban from taking control of opium fields in Afghanistan.
[00:05:06.384 --> 00:05:13.088]  Over the weekend, the airstrikes were called in after the Taliban seized weapons and vehicles from Afghan soldiers.
[00:05:13.088 --> 00:05:22.614]  Helmand province is said to be one of the world's largest opium-producing regions, larger than the whole of Burma, which is the second largest producer of opium.
[00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:27.336]  Production of opium reached an all-time high under the military control of the U.S.
[00:05:27.336 --> 00:05:27.877]  and NATO.
[00:05:28.997 --> 00:05:39.183]  According to a report issued in 2013 by the Afghanistan Opium Survey of the United Nations, cultivation of poppy increased 36% in 2013.
[00:05:39.183 --> 00:05:46.087]  Total opium production amounted to 5,500 tons of nearly half since 2012.
[00:05:46.087 --> 00:05:53.071]  And prior to the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan, the Taliban had successfully blocked production of opium.
[00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:55.992]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[00:06:58.736 --> 00:07:04.660]  Supermail Vitality is InfoWarsLife.com's number one selling product for a good reason.

[00:07:16.928 --> 00:07:28.880]  It is concentrated herbs and natural organic compounds known to energize the body's natural processes that are blocked by estrogen mimickers and other toxic elements in the food chain.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.925]  Super Mill Vitality from Infowarslife.com has sold out multiple times in the last three months.
[00:07:34.065 --> 00:07:34.425]  We're good.
[00:08:16.087 --> 00:08:22.592]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:22.592 --> 00:08:29.738]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.738 --> 00:08:44.330]  Well this morning when the news came out just a few hours ago that there'd been a tragic shooting on live television, the first thing I thought was disgruntled employee on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor or similar drug.
[00:08:45.487 --> 00:09:01.470]  Only reason is, is that most the time it's a disgruntled employee and almost all the time, whether it's disgruntled or not, they're on some type of psychotropic drug where the inserts say it can make you do this.
[00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.931]  You'll have a thought when you're a normal person and think that's a crazy thought.
[00:09:04.931 --> 00:09:08.472]  You'll have it when you're on these drugs and think that's an imperative to go out and do it.
[00:09:10.538 --> 00:09:12.262]  But another wrinkle was added.
[00:09:12.262 --> 00:09:18.235]  I knew that the system, the controlled media would come out and apply guilt to all gun owners.
[00:09:18.235 --> 00:09:19.678]  Almost 200 million people now.
[00:09:21.148 --> 00:09:22.569]  It's over 170 million.
[00:09:22.569 --> 00:09:24.689]  More people are buying guns all the time.
[00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:32.732]  It's causing crime rates to go down across the nation, except for areas where guns have been restricted, and the crime rates are exploding there.
[00:09:32.732 --> 00:09:40.095]  We've got a report Rob Dew is putting together with all the official Justice Department graphs, the latest numbers, to show that and prove that.
[00:09:41.095 --> 00:09:46.460]  As the economy degenerates, though, crime is going to naturally go up.
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:58.492]  That's why having guns and security and locking your doors and having neighborhood watch and basic things like that are going to be more important than ever in this climate.
[00:10:00.379 --> 00:10:05.201]  And then he started tweeting live until he killed himself about 15 minutes ago.
[00:10:05.201 --> 00:10:14.924]  As of air time, 1110 Central, he killed himself about 5 to 11 Central time, 5 to noon, Eastern time.
[00:10:14.924 --> 00:10:18.745]  After the police had chased him and cornered him.
[00:10:18.745 --> 00:10:20.726]  He went by Bryce Williams.
[00:10:20.726 --> 00:10:28.789]  Paul Watson's done the research, found that years ago, more than a decade ago, he sued a TV station he worked for in Florida.
[00:10:29.873 --> 00:10:32.876]  And now we're digging up more intel that this is just the same M.O.
[00:10:32.876 --> 00:10:40.264]  Every TV station, he went to EEOC filings, everyone's racist, everyone's out to get him.
[00:10:40.264 --> 00:10:45.189]  I've been looking at photos and videos of him, whacked out of his mind.
[00:10:45.189 --> 00:10:51.316]  Not hired to be a reporter, not hired to be anchor, but wanting to be an anchor, wanting to be a reporter.
[00:10:53.971 --> 00:10:55.352]  Gets on psychotropic drugs.
[00:10:55.352 --> 00:10:57.233]  You know that's coming out.
[00:10:57.233 --> 00:10:58.194]  You can guarantee it.
[00:10:58.194 --> 00:11:01.536]  Just like I said with the Charleston shooting.
[00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:04.578]  That hasn't been established yet, but I bet money within two days.
[00:11:04.578 --> 00:11:05.459]  Bet money.
[00:11:05.459 --> 00:11:07.920]  I've never seen it not be.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.901]  People don't do this normally.
[00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:12.943]  White, black, roll the same as what you do when you're on these things.
[00:11:12.943 --> 00:11:17.947]  And then you've got MSNBC, CNN, and the thousands of tweets polls reported on per article.
[00:11:18.632 --> 00:11:25.277]  Where it's kill wives, let's start killing, let's beat them up, let's shoot them, let's go in their neighborhoods, let's burn down their houses, let's kill cops.
[00:11:25.277 --> 00:11:31.382]  MSNBC having guests on that say, deck the halls with dead cops, fa-la-la-la-la-la.
[00:11:31.382 --> 00:11:37.707]  These are Soros-funded groups, led by Nancy Pelosi's top staffer, Hillary Clinton's involved.
[00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.131]  Does that mean there aren't some out-of-control cops and some problems?
[00:11:42.131 --> 00:11:46.453]  Absolutely, but the answer is don't go out and just randomly shoot cops.
[00:11:46.453 --> 00:11:55.256]  The answer isn't just go out and randomly... Some lady's at a Catholic church going to pray for her mom, you know, who's dying, and so, hey, a white lady went in that church.
[00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:55.957]  Nobody's in there.
[00:11:55.957 --> 00:11:56.817]  It's open.
[00:11:56.817 --> 00:12:01.159]  Let's go beat her up and rob her, because she's white, because it's okay, because she's white.
[00:12:02.338 --> 00:12:03.498]  It's like the Klan.
[00:12:03.498 --> 00:12:07.020]  Let's go lynch this black person and rob them, because they're black.
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:07.700]  They deserve it.
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.721]  It's the same gang mentality.
[00:12:09.721 --> 00:12:23.366]  So you had Charleston, which was fully blamed on the Second Amendment, and then the guilt was applied to white people in general, and you had all these black organizations and groups saying, it's time to start killing whites.
[00:12:23.366 --> 00:12:30.429]  And then I said, if this starts getting triggered, you're going to have other unstable, mentally ill black people
[00:12:31.383 --> 00:12:39.028]  Go out and kill white people, and then other mentally unstable white people are going to go out and start killing black people.
[00:12:39.028 --> 00:12:48.595]  And then if it really starts kicking off, you're going to get a full-bore shooting war in this country, and there's going to be dead people all over the place, chief amongst them the police.
[00:12:48.595 --> 00:12:57.181]  And that will be the destabilization the feds use to come in and fully federalize, which is what Obama told his cousin Odinga, the Muslim leader,
[00:12:57.961 --> 00:13:04.224]  When he lost the presidency of Kenya, he said, have people go out and riot and start burning stuff.
[00:13:04.224 --> 00:13:13.788]  And Odinga did it for two months, and they gave him the prime ministership, created a new level of government, basically co-president.
[00:13:13.788 --> 00:13:16.149]  And did the Muslims, the radical Islamists, stop then?
[00:13:16.149 --> 00:13:19.470]  No, they started attacking malls, police stations, all of it.
[00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.711]  I mean, these people know what they're doing.
[00:13:21.414 --> 00:13:41.588]  And I'm not saying it's a Muslim takeover here, I'm saying, when George Soros spends over $100 million, $33 million in Ferguson alone, to stir up and to try to get a race war going, and MSNBC and CNN and others promote it like it's normal and good, they plan on doing this.
[00:13:41.588 --> 00:13:47.272]  They hope Charleston, when Dylan Roof, the drug out of his mind on amnesics,
[00:13:48.325 --> 00:13:50.106]  From his psychiatrist.
[00:13:50.106 --> 00:13:50.986]  Amnesics, folks.
[00:13:50.986 --> 00:13:52.527]  That's what Sirhan Sirhan was on.
[00:13:52.527 --> 00:14:02.031]  I'm not saying this is staged, but it's staged in that you're just giving people, it'd be like if you went and gave a bunch of high school kids in the prom punch PCP.
[00:14:02.031 --> 00:14:14.396]  You're not going to order some of them to drive off cliffs or cut their arms off or murder people, but you basically did it knowing statistically you give 500 people at a prom PCP, there's going to be probably 20-30 deaths that night.
[00:14:16.192 --> 00:14:17.213]  It's the same thing.
[00:14:17.213 --> 00:14:19.675]  You put 20% of the U.S.
[00:14:19.675 --> 00:14:28.924]  public on psychotropics and other hardcore drugs, you're going to have side effects in a percentage of them, and it's not going to be pretty.
[00:14:28.924 --> 00:14:31.766]  They're suicide mass murder pills.
[00:14:31.766 --> 00:14:33.248]  That's what you blame.
[00:14:33.248 --> 00:14:39.734]  As I told Piers Morgan two, three years ago, they were going to have me three segments, and they came in and said, sponsors, sponsors.
[00:14:41.721 --> 00:14:48.468]  And I know that meant don't attack the fact that they actually had Prozac-type drug ads on that very broadcast.
[00:14:48.468 --> 00:14:51.511]  And I said, Piers, you got Prozac-type ads on here.
[00:14:51.511 --> 00:14:56.877]  Stop blaming the Second Amendment for what's going on here.
[00:14:56.877 --> 00:14:59.479]  Almost every mass shooter is on them.
[00:15:00.216 --> 00:15:02.457]  And they're all whacked out of their brains.
[00:15:02.457 --> 00:15:07.360]  If you look at Adam Lanza, any of these puppets, the Batman shooter, James Holmes.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.541]  You look at these people, white, black, I don't care.
[00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:12.083]  They're whacked out of their minds.
[00:15:12.083 --> 00:15:16.185]  You look at the new shooter.
[00:15:16.185 --> 00:15:18.567]  Let's put this up on screen, this article.
[00:15:18.567 --> 00:15:23.830]  Virginia shooter who killed two journalists in live broadcast commits suicide report.
[00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:24.250]  You look.
[00:15:25.327 --> 00:15:31.172]  At the photos of him, the same million yard stare.
[00:15:31.172 --> 00:15:36.717]  That stare, I only see that in people who are whacked out of their brains on drugs.
[00:15:36.717 --> 00:15:39.639]  I see meth heads that look like that too.
[00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:44.764]  Who haven't slept properly in six months.
[00:15:44.764 --> 00:15:48.027]  And that's what is to blame here with a cocktail
[00:15:49.716 --> 00:15:51.117]  Of media brainwashing.
[00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:56.882]  And by the way, I've told this story hundreds of times, I'll say it again, you can look it up in Criminology.
[00:15:56.882 --> 00:16:05.950]  Until they put fences up, 20 foot fences, and walled in the Empire State's building, the World Trade Centers before they were destroyed in 91, 2001, excuse me.
[00:16:10.026 --> 00:16:22.173]  Every time someone jumped off and committed suicide, they'd have 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 people show up in an hour of the news reporting it to jump off so they'd station police there to stop them.
[00:16:22.173 --> 00:16:35.481]  The New York police are stationing police outside newsrooms across New York City right now because their criminology shows they'll probably have somebody try to go kill more reporters.
[00:16:36.311 --> 00:16:59.119]  And that's the thing about giving so much attention to mass shootings is the media knows that mentally ill people who would just commit suicide or would do suicide by cop, they'll think, no, I'll go kill somebody I don't like or I'll go shoot up a bunch of kids and then you don't even have to have somebody in a government MKUltra laboratory and have a mind control to go do it like Sirhan Sirhan.
[00:17:00.151 --> 00:17:13.178]  You simply put it out there with enough of a drugged out, suggestible, mesmerized, hypnotized population, and they're going to go out and they're going to commit these acts guaranteed.
[00:17:13.178 --> 00:17:15.340]  They've got metrics, they've got an analysis.
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:22.724]  And as the economy implodes, as society gets crazy, as things degenerate, you can bet all the tea in China.
[00:17:25.785 --> 00:17:28.247]  That the world is going to get crazy.
[00:17:28.247 --> 00:17:40.114]  And you know, we've had the great statistics that since 92, because of gun ownership increasing and police forces expanding in size, they basically tripled.
[00:17:40.114 --> 00:17:44.857]  It's both those, but even the police groups admit it's the guns more than the police.
[00:17:44.857 --> 00:17:47.239]  Going out, crime rates have dropped 52%.
[00:17:47.239 --> 00:17:48.660]  Some estimates are over 60% using guns.
[00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.477]  Now, because of the economy imploding?
[00:17:57.372 --> 00:18:00.193]  And the whole gang culture getting pushed across the board?
[00:18:00.193 --> 00:18:03.394]  I think you're going to see crime massively increase.
[00:18:03.394 --> 00:18:09.497]  I don't know if it'll be as bad as the 80s, but this is the time to have guns to protect your family.
[00:18:09.497 --> 00:18:13.559]  This is the time to start legally and lawfully check your local laws to carry guns.
[00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:25.944]  This is the time not to go out and hate the police, but to try to get control of your local departments, get good people elected, good sheriffs in, good police chiefs in, for the community to work together, try to stabilize this nation.
[00:18:26.684 --> 00:18:29.286]  Because the globalists want to destabilize it.
[00:18:29.286 --> 00:18:31.067]  They want to get us at each other's throats.
[00:18:31.067 --> 00:18:32.488]  That is not the answer.
[00:18:32.488 --> 00:18:52.883]  The answer is to come together around the Bill of Rights, Constitution, due process, private property, and it's time for police, who are getting evil orders I know in many departments, to just quietly do the right thing and help this country and not get into the globalist culture of being thugs or being paramilitary and to be true peace officers and to be honorable
[00:18:53.263 --> 00:18:54.184]  Honorable men and women.
[00:18:54.184 --> 00:18:55.846]  And I know most of you want to do that.
[00:18:55.846 --> 00:19:03.957]  So that's why I'm counting on you to do that because this is a premeditated takedown of America and the rest of the world we're about to go into.
[00:19:03.957 --> 00:19:07.942]  And this guy shooting these white people because he was whacked out and racist.
[00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:22.602]  Doesn't need to cause any retaliation by white people, just like when, whacked out of his mind, Dylan Roof went and shot these poor nine people who'd done nothing to him, cold-bloodedly.
[00:19:22.602 --> 00:19:28.227]  That community came together, and the people that wanted a race war on both sides didn't get what they wanted.
[00:19:28.227 --> 00:19:34.953]  So we should really say a prayer for these two dead people, this reporter and this cameraman, and just realize that
[00:19:35.874 --> 00:19:37.915]  You cannot blame the Second Amendment for this.
[00:19:37.915 --> 00:19:41.158]  What psychos do is their fault.
[00:19:41.158 --> 00:19:43.639]  They're going to try to use this on the Second Amendment.
[00:19:43.639 --> 00:19:44.960]  They're already doing it.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:50.063]  Obama's writing a bunch of executive action that's so draconian, I have trouble believing how bold it is.
[00:19:50.063 --> 00:19:53.005]  So things are only intensifying.
[00:19:53.005 --> 00:19:56.688]  And we can't let this distract us from all the other big news as well.
[00:19:59.295 --> 00:20:05.437]  Virtually anyone can hack your cell phone and track your calls, your texts, your emails, your every movement.
[00:20:05.437 --> 00:20:07.538]  But only if they can detect a signal.
[00:20:07.538 --> 00:20:11.519]  Stay one step ahead of hackers and Big Brother with a BlockIt Pocket.

[00:20:28.777 --> 00:20:29.477]  Okay.
[00:20:29.477 --> 00:20:31.439]  Open your mouth and say, ah.
[00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:32.019]  Ah.
[00:20:32.019 --> 00:20:34.680]  When your child has a sore throat, you need to know when to get help.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.081]  The doctor recommended Say Ah!
[00:20:36.081 --> 00:20:37.902]  Sore Throat Exam is your solution.

[00:21:17.049 --> 00:21:19.711]  They just don't have enough nutrition to do the job.

[00:21:28.345 --> 00:21:34.147]  So I say to Mark at lunch, look, you know, I keep hearing from the government that, you know, they're worried someday ISIS may get here.
[00:21:34.147 --> 00:21:40.289]  Then I go, duh, Garland, Texas, Mohammed cartoon shooting, ISIS is already here.
[00:21:40.289 --> 00:21:42.509]  I'm not waiting for these people to defend me.
[00:21:42.509 --> 00:21:46.831]  If they don't know ISIS is here already, they got no clue, I'm taking care of myself.
[00:21:46.831 --> 00:21:53.393]  Guns80.com, AR-15 kits, 30 shot magazines, great prices, they've even got the Hillary special.

[00:21:58.888 --> 00:22:00.089]  That's disgusting!
[00:22:00.089 --> 00:22:01.130]  What's that smell?
[00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:03.171]  Roll down your window before I pass out!
[00:22:03.171 --> 00:22:05.613]  It's those nasty fish oil pills I've been taking.
[00:22:05.613 --> 00:22:08.315]  Why won't you just switch to Nutrigold fish oil like I did?
[00:22:08.315 --> 00:22:09.696]  It's fish oil!
[00:22:09.696 --> 00:22:10.816]  What's the difference?
[00:22:10.816 --> 00:22:15.380]  Well, my Nutrigold fish oil is sourced and manufactured right here in the USA.
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.581]  What's so special about that?
[00:22:16.581 --> 00:22:17.261]  Aren't they all?
[00:22:17.261 --> 00:22:17.841]  Are you kidding?
[00:22:17.841 --> 00:22:19.162]  Of course not!
[00:22:19.162 --> 00:22:22.084]  Only Nutrigold fish oil is 100% USA made, which is why it's so fresh.
[00:22:25.329 --> 00:22:27.490]  100% product of USA and fresh?
[00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:28.871]  I like the sound of that.
[00:22:28.871 --> 00:22:30.391]  So, no more fish burps?
[00:22:30.391 --> 00:22:31.452]  No more fish burps.
[00:22:31.452 --> 00:22:32.552]  And that's not all.
[00:22:32.552 --> 00:22:39.555]  If you go to www.fishoil.fest and enter my fish oil, you can save $5 like I did.
[00:22:39.555 --> 00:22:40.496]  That won't be necessary.
[00:22:40.496 --> 00:22:41.956]  We can just share your bottle.
[00:22:41.956 --> 00:22:42.756]  Nice try.
[00:22:42.756 --> 00:22:46.298]  Get your own at www.fishoil.fest.
[00:22:47.239 --> 00:22:47.679]  Sorry.
[00:22:47.679 --> 00:22:49.260]  Get rid of those fish burps for good.

[00:22:57.966 --> 00:22:58.947]  Hey, Berky Guy here.
[00:22:58.947 --> 00:23:00.668]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[00:23:00.668 --> 00:23:02.530]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:04.491]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?
[00:23:04.491 --> 00:23:10.495]  The Berky Guy is here to help you remove these and other potential contaminants from your water, thus helping you drink clean, purified water.
[00:23:10.495 --> 00:23:13.097]  We offer Berky water purification systems at the lowest available
[00:23:13.157 --> 00:23:13.678]  I think so.
[00:23:28.354 --> 00:23:28.854]  I think so.
[00:24:02.529 --> 00:24:07.615]  They don't want to see us tonight.
[00:24:07.615 --> 00:24:16.805]  All they want us to do is keep on fussing and fighting.
[00:24:16.805 --> 00:24:19.528]  They don't want to see us leave.
[00:24:33.147 --> 00:24:39.470]  All they want us to do is to keep on killing one another.
[00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:58.737]  Whether it's the Charleston church shooting motivated by racism, media hype, race war, or whether it's the Virginia TV shooting, this is the mainstream media influencing big pharma hits.
[00:24:58.737 --> 00:25:02.239]  And I said that days before it came out on the Virginia
[00:25:04.065 --> 00:25:12.632]  Situation I said that days before it came out on the Charleston situation and I'm saying that that I believe it will come out with this Virginia situation.
[00:25:15.987 --> 00:25:17.988]  But here's what we know if you just joined us.
[00:25:17.988 --> 00:25:23.050]  This is now the number one big story in the world.
[00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:28.413]  I've had BBC call me, emails from Al Jazeera.
[00:25:28.413 --> 00:25:35.196]  I mean my phone is ringing off the hook with mainstream media wanting to talk to me.
[00:25:35.196 --> 00:25:40.499]  This morning I came out of the gym and the BBC was on the phone.
[00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:47.113]  They're like, well, what do you say as a promoter of the Second Amendment now that this has happened?
[00:25:47.113 --> 00:25:49.294]  And I said, it's probably just grown old mentally old person.
[00:25:49.294 --> 00:25:51.035]  That's why you need guns to protect yourself.
[00:25:51.035 --> 00:25:53.797]  But you can't ever protect yourself completely and bad things just happen.
[00:25:53.797 --> 00:25:58.120]  But overall, crime is down with guns because good people have guns.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.582]  But if the media hypes this up, there'll be a bunch of copycats.
[00:26:03.991 --> 00:26:04.491]  Oh, really?
[00:26:04.491 --> 00:26:06.073]  That's really what you think?
[00:26:06.073 --> 00:26:13.598]  Yeah, that's why as soon as I got in the car, it was on the news that the New York Police stationed cops out front the TV news stations.
[00:26:13.598 --> 00:26:22.184]  Because other mentally ill people who are highly suggestible, there's a good chance they're going to go attack the TV stations.
[00:26:22.184 --> 00:26:31.871]  Don't you think I've thought about this, somebody that does live broadcast, that has reporters out in the field, that goes out without bodyguards and gives speeches, like I did last weekend?
[00:26:31.871 --> 00:26:32.752]  There's no security there.
[00:26:34.019 --> 00:26:35.420]  You just gut up and you do it.
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.701]  You make the decision.
[00:26:36.701 --> 00:26:44.508]  Just like I get my kids every morning when I take them to school or the nanny takes them to school and put them in the car.
[00:26:44.508 --> 00:26:47.891]  That's the number one cause of death until they're about 60 years of age.
[00:26:47.891 --> 00:26:49.833]  It's playing Frogger.
[00:26:49.833 --> 00:26:50.894]  My kids are the frog.
[00:26:50.894 --> 00:26:55.878]  And we're out there driving around with big 18 wheelers, 70 miles an hour right beside us.
[00:26:55.878 --> 00:26:57.880]  There could be a blowout, a jackknife.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:58.921]  We're all dead.
[00:26:59.889 --> 00:27:01.570]  But I accept it.
[00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:03.332]  I go past the fear.
[00:27:03.332 --> 00:27:04.512]  I'm aware it's part of life.
[00:27:04.512 --> 00:27:07.335]  I try to drive safe.
[00:27:07.335 --> 00:27:14.760]  And it's much more dangerous to drive a car than it is to swim in a lake or anything.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:21.065]  And way down the line, one of the rarest ways to get killed, if it's not by your own hand, is somebody shooting you with a gun.
[00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:28.392]  And you hear about the national numbers of 15,000 people who got, you know, killed with guns last year in the United States.
[00:27:28.392 --> 00:27:28.933]  Yeah!
[00:27:28.933 --> 00:27:37.417]  And 13,000 plus of them were gangbangers and criminals and people breaking into houses and people shooting at the police!
[00:27:37.417 --> 00:27:41.758]  Only a couple thousand were innocent!
[00:27:41.758 --> 00:27:44.340]  Then you look at those numbers.
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.061]  Most of them committed suicide!
[00:27:48.345 --> 00:27:50.426]  Aren't you for a right to die out there in the left?
[00:27:50.426 --> 00:27:51.527]  No, you're not.
[00:27:51.527 --> 00:27:53.148]  So, how are they going to spin this?
[00:27:53.148 --> 00:28:12.379]  They're going to show the dramatic footage that we're about to roll right now of him in first person, point of view, with the gun, this Vester Flanagan, we'll start rolling that video, with the gun out front as he goes and shoots the reporter.
[00:28:14.221 --> 00:28:20.583]  And he's got the gun for like a minute or more, walking around her, menacing.
[00:28:20.583 --> 00:28:26.044]  And she's so focused, doing the interview about tourism, that they have no idea.
[00:28:26.044 --> 00:28:28.705]  Then there's the cameraman.
[00:28:28.705 --> 00:28:31.805]  I guess he hadn't followed an EEOC thing on him, but I guess he still deserves it.
[00:28:31.805 --> 00:28:32.185]  He is white.
[00:28:32.185 --> 00:28:36.866]  Alright, guns her down, she's dead.
[00:28:36.866 --> 00:28:38.907]  And then turns the gun and shoots the cameraman.
[00:28:42.068 --> 00:28:46.770]  And they are going to sit there and hammer that and push that and promote that.
[00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:52.592]  And if you go to the front page of Infowars.com, guns don't kill people, psychos kill people.
[00:28:52.592 --> 00:28:54.893]  That's an Alex Jones quote.
[00:28:54.893 --> 00:28:56.553]  That's a variant of the famous quote.
[00:28:56.553 --> 00:28:59.274]  No one knows who first said it.
[00:28:59.274 --> 00:29:02.676]  People don't kill people.
[00:29:02.676 --> 00:29:08.198]  If you're the view of the Brady Center, it's guns that come out of their cases at night and go out and kill people on their own.
[00:29:08.198 --> 00:29:08.898]  No, the truth is
[00:29:10.356 --> 00:29:11.597]  Guns don't kill people.
[00:29:11.597 --> 00:29:12.898]  People kill people.
[00:29:12.898 --> 00:29:14.620]  Well, there's the Alex Jones version.
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:15.981]  Guns don't kill people.
[00:29:15.981 --> 00:29:17.523]  Psychos kill people.
[00:29:17.523 --> 00:29:30.114]  And if you look at the image of his face from the TV cameraman's camera on the live feed as he drops the camera after being shot in the back, there is the gunman who they said was dead.
[00:29:30.114 --> 00:29:33.938]  Now they're saying he's got a pulse and is in critical condition.
[00:29:35.211 --> 00:29:37.052]  After trying to take his own life.
[00:29:37.052 --> 00:29:39.772]  So, the narrative is changing.
[00:29:39.772 --> 00:29:44.854]  We're gonna go over all the news on this front, open the phones up for you to respond straight ahead.
[00:29:44.854 --> 00:29:49.555]  But what are the odds he was on mind-altering pharmacological drugs?
[00:29:49.555 --> 00:29:52.076]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.076 --> 00:29:54.777]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:58.959 --> 00:30:04.827]  We now know why StemXpress was so desperate to censor the undercover Planned Parenthood video featuring its CEO.
[00:30:04.827 --> 00:30:16.643]  The law prohibits organ and tissue donors from selling for profit, yet solicitation materials from StemXpress repeatedly tout how financially profitable and rewarding and beneficial it can be to the fiscal growth for abortion clinics.
[00:30:16.803 --> 00:30:24.114]  And when asked what they can do to help clinics that aren't profiting, the CEO is astonished and says she doesn't know any who aren't profiting.
[00:30:24.114 --> 00:30:25.797]  You want to say this is about women's health?
[00:30:25.797 --> 00:30:32.067]  She talks about the contamination of samples with staff due to unsanitary clinic conditions being a repeated problem.
[00:30:32.307 --> 00:30:37.533]  And the Stem Express CEO talks about the stigma of delivering butchered baby parts to labs.
[00:30:37.533 --> 00:30:38.474]  How they freak out.
[00:30:38.474 --> 00:30:40.516]  How they have meltdowns when they get a whole head.
[00:30:40.516 --> 00:30:45.201]  How they'll request hands and feet to be removed from limbs so they don't have to confront what it is.
[00:30:45.201 --> 00:30:47.964]  But then she comments, but we know what it is.
[00:30:47.964 --> 00:30:52.569]  For that reason, she says, many are turning to adult stem cells or bone marrow.
[00:30:52.569 --> 00:30:53.250]  And she concludes,
[00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:55.311]  You're either in the closet or not.
[00:30:55.311 --> 00:30:55.671]  Yeah.
[00:30:55.671 --> 00:30:58.793]  This is David Knight, reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:30:58.793 --> 00:31:03.937]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life Vitamin B12 formulation.

[00:31:14.844 --> 00:31:18.426]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[00:31:29.756 --> 00:31:31.978]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:31:31.978 --> 00:31:36.963]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:31:36.963 --> 00:31:40.266]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:31:40.266 --> 00:31:43.749]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:31:43.749 --> 00:31:45.431]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:31:45.691 --> 00:31:46.631]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:31:46.631 --> 00:31:47.831]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:31:47.831 --> 00:31:49.812]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:31:49.812 --> 00:31:57.093]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:31:57.093 --> 00:32:05.634]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:33:20.879 --> 00:33:23.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:38.809 --> 00:33:47.396]  If you go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, you can see the latest articles, a truly sickening one, by Steve Watson.
[00:33:47.396 --> 00:33:51.219]  Anti-gunners jump on tragic TV cruise shooting.
[00:33:51.219 --> 00:33:56.322]  They're flooding Twitter with anti-gun diatribes before bodies are cold.
[00:33:56.322 --> 00:34:02.407]  And it's the same leftist, anti-American scum, literal scum, social engineers.
[00:34:02.407 --> 00:34:03.508]  These people are fascist.
[00:34:03.508 --> 00:34:04.269]  I know them.
[00:34:04.269 --> 00:34:06.610]  They know they are engineers.
[00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:08.532]  They know they're manipulating gullible people.
[00:34:09.252 --> 00:34:10.954]  They're not liberals like Thomas Jefferson.
[00:34:10.954 --> 00:34:12.375]  They're scum of the earth.
[00:34:12.375 --> 00:34:14.437]  Look at Hillary Clinton.
[00:34:14.437 --> 00:34:15.538]  Heartbroken and angry.
[00:34:15.538 --> 00:34:19.442]  We must act to stop gun violence and we cannot wait any longer.
[00:34:19.442 --> 00:34:21.964]  Praying for the victims' families in Virginia.
[00:34:21.964 --> 00:34:23.145]  I want to send a tweet out.
[00:34:23.145 --> 00:34:25.807]  I was trying to do it during the break, but ran out of time.
[00:34:25.807 --> 00:34:27.689]  Doing five things at once.
[00:34:27.689 --> 00:34:31.412]  At Hillary, saying, listen, witch!
[00:34:31.412 --> 00:34:34.035]  You turned Libya over to Al-Qaeda and killed over 50,000 people.
[00:34:35.598 --> 00:34:37.540]  Shut up about violence!
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.881]  And I want to hit her with another tweet.
[00:34:39.881 --> 00:34:42.783]  Listen, witch!
[00:34:42.783 --> 00:34:47.327]  It's your White House pushing race war and now blaming the Second Amendment.
[00:34:47.327 --> 00:34:48.528]  I want her hit with all that.
[00:34:49.471 --> 00:35:10.059]  It's time to hit these people on Twitter, on Facebook, all of you, because they are up there arrogantly blaming the Second Amendment and almost 200 million gun owners in this country that protect ourselves as if we are guilty for the Charleston shooting and this Virginia shooting that two whacked out nuts carried out.
[00:35:10.059 --> 00:35:14.321]  When statistically, there's less mass shootings than there were.
[00:35:14.321 --> 00:35:16.702]  And Hillary knows that full well, she's got bodyguards.
[00:35:17.671 --> 00:35:20.433]  Hey Hillary, you got bodyguards.
[00:35:20.433 --> 00:35:22.314]  Are their guns bad too?
[00:35:22.314 --> 00:35:26.336]  Why can't I have a gun to protect myself, you bitch?
[00:35:26.336 --> 00:35:32.059]  I mean, I am sick of these people, and excuse me using my French, but, cause that's mean to a female dog.
[00:35:32.059 --> 00:35:34.441]  That, that, that pejorative.
[00:35:34.441 --> 00:35:37.983]  But you know what, when a guy's a jerk, we call him a bastard or whatever.
[00:35:39.062 --> 00:35:40.803]  Nothing wrong with a lot of friends that are bastards.
[00:35:40.803 --> 00:35:49.330]  The point is, why can't we call a woman when she's as hard as nails, mean, lying, criminal?
[00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:53.393]  A political whore for the New World Order.
[00:35:53.393 --> 00:35:54.253]  So is Bill Clinton.
[00:35:54.253 --> 00:35:56.475]  He's just a gigolo for the New World Order.
[00:35:56.475 --> 00:35:58.977]  A prostitute.
[00:35:58.977 --> 00:36:01.599]  Now that goes around in the media pushing his propaganda.
[00:36:01.599 --> 00:36:05.202]  Why aren't we supposed to call these monsters out for what they are?
[00:36:06.047 --> 00:36:16.974]  A hypocrite with a whole bunch of bodyguards and guns, just like Dianne Feinstein, just like Michael Moore who's got bodyguards, and then she sits there and says, heartbroken and angry.
[00:36:16.974 --> 00:36:18.856]  Oh, you're so heartbroken.
[00:36:18.856 --> 00:36:28.942]  I came to Libya, I saw Qaddafi died, the country fell apart, tens of thousands more died, it's a failed country.
[00:36:28.942 --> 00:36:31.244]  We used the IRS to persecute tens of thousands.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.801]  We shipped guns into Mexico that killed thousands to blame the Second Amendment?
[00:36:35.801 --> 00:36:39.722]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:36:39.722 --> 00:36:40.402]  And here's the problem.
[00:36:40.402 --> 00:36:41.703]  I've taken my filters off.
[00:36:41.703 --> 00:36:42.823]  It's a family show.
[00:36:42.823 --> 00:36:44.503]  I'm going to stop talking like that on air.
[00:36:44.503 --> 00:36:45.224]  I apologize.
[00:36:45.224 --> 00:36:49.885]  It's just I've gotten so real that I can't look at her anymore without saying what I think of her.
[00:36:51.055 --> 00:37:01.945]  She is a joker-faced, arrogant, lying criminal that flaunts it in our face, and I'm sick of her, and I'm sick of Barack Obama.
[00:37:01.945 --> 00:37:06.189]  Barack Obama's got a new quote out in a speech on InfoWars.com.
[00:37:06.189 --> 00:37:11.093]  I'll read the actual quote in a moment, but it basically says, it's time to just ignore people that don't agree with us.
[00:37:11.093 --> 00:37:12.875]  We're going to do what we want regardless.
[00:37:12.875 --> 00:37:13.756]  Yeah, we know that!
[00:37:15.868 --> 00:37:17.609]  You are destroying this country.
[00:37:17.609 --> 00:37:19.270]  You're destroying America's name.
[00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:24.133]  You're bankrupting us on purpose to be your slaves.
[00:37:24.133 --> 00:37:26.474]  And then you're trying to start a race war.
[00:37:26.474 --> 00:37:27.995]  There's the headline, Obama.
[00:37:27.995 --> 00:37:35.660]  We can't pay attention to folks whose ideologies run counter to where we need to go.
[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:40.383]  And that graphic is so powerful.
[00:37:41.943 --> 00:37:45.887]  I was saying, whoever in the office made that graphic, it's a gold star.
[00:37:45.887 --> 00:37:54.355]  I see it's not ours, but, I mean, that really captures in that photo of him how evil, just how out of control, I mean, we're going into real tyranny, folks.
[00:37:54.355 --> 00:37:57.798]  We're in the grasp of really bad people that want to dominate us.
[00:37:58.519 --> 00:38:08.707]  They're the equivalent, again, of serial killers that want to grab a five-year-old out of a playground and torture him for a month in a subterranean dungeon because they love to terrorize him and have him beg for mommy.
[00:38:08.707 --> 00:38:13.952]  You hear a child beg for mommy and sob in disdain for five seconds, you want to tear your guts out.
[00:38:13.952 --> 00:38:19.256]  To them, it's like apple pie and mama's milk, baby!
[00:38:19.256 --> 00:38:19.856]  You understand?
[00:38:19.856 --> 00:38:21.918]  Ugh, these people are evil!
[00:38:21.918 --> 00:38:23.779]  They're evil!
[00:38:23.779 --> 00:38:24.060]  Evil!
[00:38:24.813 --> 00:38:30.137]  If you just got your mind around them, they are the filth of the planet!
[00:38:30.137 --> 00:38:35.241]  Oh, Hillary's broken-hearted and angry!
[00:38:35.241 --> 00:38:39.424]  We must act to stop gun violence and we cannot wait any longer.
[00:38:39.424 --> 00:38:42.086]  Praying for the victims' families in Virginia.
[00:38:42.086 --> 00:38:51.273]  Paul Watson tweeted back at the witch and said, absolutely shameful, they used to wait at least a few hours before politicizing tragedy, now it's instantaneous, absolutely.
[00:38:51.273 --> 00:38:51.773]  And now,
[00:38:52.839 --> 00:39:03.305]  It comes out that he is basically a Black Lives Matter obsessed, all the white people are out to get me, constantly filing EEOC complaints.
[00:39:03.305 --> 00:39:05.666]  He was tweeting, he goes, yeah, she was racist.
[00:39:05.666 --> 00:39:07.407]  She made a racist comment.
[00:39:07.407 --> 00:39:09.888]  I reported to the EEOC.
[00:39:09.888 --> 00:39:14.670]  I bet the EEOC will try to do a $100,000 fine on the dead people.
[00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:20.814]  I wonder if they'll fine them and maybe burn their dead bodies at the stake in front of the White House.
[00:39:23.428 --> 00:39:24.169]  I mean, who knows?
[00:39:24.169 --> 00:39:28.413]  Because that's the whole religion that's pushed here.
[00:39:28.413 --> 00:39:33.617]  And the chip-on-the-shoulder attitude that is basically going around.
[00:39:33.617 --> 00:39:41.964]  And then it creates this chip-on-the-shoulder by people like Dylan Roof, who also buys in from the other angle of the whole race war that's getting pushed.
[00:39:43.643 --> 00:39:47.146]  Let's go ahead and play one more time that first-person video from the start.
[00:39:47.146 --> 00:39:54.771]  If you're an InfoWars visitor, you go to InfoWars.com forward slash show and find the free video and audio feeds.
[00:39:54.771 --> 00:40:02.176]  Radio listeners, of course, out there listening can go online to InfoWars.com if they have time and see the free feed or we have the video posted.
[00:40:02.176 --> 00:40:05.759]  They've been pulling it down, though some of the media is showing it.
[00:40:05.759 --> 00:40:07.941]  And we've got his tweets, which they admit was his Twitter.
[00:40:08.721 --> 00:40:12.344]  He reportedly shot himself live on air and is now in critical condition.
[00:40:12.344 --> 00:40:12.984]  Maybe dead.
[00:40:12.984 --> 00:40:15.566]  They're going back and forth.
[00:40:15.566 --> 00:40:23.913]  But certainly dramatic and tailor-made, except for the fact in his tweets he says, EEOC report filed.
[00:40:23.913 --> 00:40:27.996]  Ooh, my goodness.
[00:40:27.996 --> 00:40:30.418]  Allison made racist comments.
[00:40:30.418 --> 00:40:31.839]  Oh, well she's dead now.
[00:40:31.839 --> 00:40:34.101]  You shot a woman in the back.
[00:40:35.049 --> 00:40:48.817]  And of course, in fairness to him, he was trying to get the cameraman, you can clearly look at it on the video, the camera person, let me be politically correct, excuse me, boy and girl is a bad term too, let's not use that, purple penguins.
[00:40:48.817 --> 00:40:52.819]  I went to a school today to drop my purple penguins off.
[00:40:52.819 --> 00:40:59.823]  We're not in a culture or anything in this country, excuse me, the cameraman got shot in the back.
[00:41:01.582 --> 00:41:05.644]  And he's trying to get her to turn around and look at him before he shoots her.
[00:41:05.644 --> 00:41:16.109]  And he's right there about two feet away with a gun aimed right at her.
[00:41:16.109 --> 00:41:19.110]  And of course, you know, the news business is competitive.
[00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:19.751]  People are rude.
[00:41:19.751 --> 00:41:20.311]  They're mean.
[00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:23.232]  It's a long way to the top if you want to rock and roll.
[00:41:23.232 --> 00:41:26.134]  And a lot of folks just can't handle it.
[00:41:26.134 --> 00:41:27.935]  And so now in the new modern age...
[00:41:31.274 --> 00:41:37.118]  And then shoot the cameraman in the back because you followed the EOC report.
[00:41:37.118 --> 00:41:42.761]  You know, I guess if Clarence Thomas talks about a pubic hair on his coke, he deserves to not have his job either.
[00:41:42.761 --> 00:41:44.702]  Maybe Anita Hill was supposed to go shoot him.
[00:41:44.702 --> 00:41:46.003]  I mean, I don't know.
[00:41:46.003 --> 00:41:47.604]  In this freaked out land, you know.
[00:41:47.604 --> 00:41:49.665]  Hey, there's a pubic hair on my coke.
[00:41:49.665 --> 00:41:52.027]  Oh my gosh, let's have a national investigation.
[00:41:52.027 --> 00:41:55.148]  He must be sexually harassing me.
[00:41:55.148 --> 00:41:59.211]  That's what was so crazy about that was that was the extent of the harassment.
[00:41:59.211 --> 00:42:00.332]  Was the pubic hair on the coke.
[00:42:00.332 --> 00:42:00.872]  Can you imagine?
[00:42:02.657 --> 00:42:30.978]  This is our country where Hillary can ship guns into Mexico, persecute people, give guns to foreign dictators, take money illegally, order a Benghazi stand down, be caught lying about it, and we're busy indicting the Texas Attorney General because he was an investment advisor and at a dinner party told two people about a good investment but didn't disclose that he was a member of the organization.
[00:42:30.978 --> 00:42:31.679]  Not ethical,
[00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:35.799]  But my gosh, they got so many laws now you can't even follow.
[00:42:35.799 --> 00:42:38.080]  I mean, maybe he's bad, maybe he's evil.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:47.527]  All I know is I have mountainous corruption hanging out in my face, in your face, in our collective face, and nothing's being done about it.
[00:42:47.527 --> 00:42:55.132]  So to recap, there was a shooting at WDBJ television in Virginia.
[00:42:55.132 --> 00:43:00.636]  Vester Flanagan was at the affiliate.
[00:43:01.977 --> 00:43:02.437]  We're good to go.
[00:43:23.354 --> 00:43:41.388]  And he's a guy that worked his way into TV from the bottom, ended up being able to be a reporter, ended up being able to do it at TV stations across the country, but continually had to leave those stations after he filed EEOC reports and lawsuits.
[00:43:41.388 --> 00:43:45.131]  And you look at him ten years ago, he looked like a pretty normal guy, looked like reporter material.
[00:43:46.065 --> 00:43:46.345]  I don't
[00:44:05.638 --> 00:44:08.779]  Psychoactive, psychotropic, slash anti-psychotic drugs.
[00:44:08.779 --> 00:44:09.840]  Probably more than that.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:13.261]  How did I just magically say, I bet he was on an amnesiac?
[00:44:13.261 --> 00:44:16.442]  Because I saw how Serhan Serhan looked in photos and film.
[00:44:16.442 --> 00:44:23.925]  I've seen how most of these people look, and when they're on an amnesiac, you really better look out.
[00:44:23.925 --> 00:44:28.007]  And that always points towards it being staged as well, because people won't remember.
[00:44:28.007 --> 00:44:31.808]  You can tell them, oh, you did the crime.
[00:44:31.808 --> 00:44:33.809]  McVeigh was given amnesiacs in prison.
[00:44:34.667 --> 00:44:42.295]  That's why he'd tell people next to his jail, I'm innocent, I'm former special forces, secret operations, which we got all the documents on, we know he was set up.
[00:44:42.295 --> 00:44:46.039]  I was infiltrating right wing groups, I didn't want to be part of the bombing.
[00:44:46.039 --> 00:44:51.685]  He told Larry Nichols that, we've had Larry Nichols, the guy from the cell next to him on, from death row.
[00:44:51.685 --> 00:44:57.110]  And it's the same story, and then it came out that Roof,
[00:44:58.413 --> 00:45:01.914]  Was on a very strong amnesia.
[00:45:01.914 --> 00:45:05.215]  So I don't know what the truth is in that case.
[00:45:05.215 --> 00:45:09.756]  But regardless, it's mind control.
[00:45:09.756 --> 00:45:19.539]  Because as a culture, you put 20% of 330 million people on drugs that the drug insert says can make you go out and have psychotic breaks.
[00:45:19.539 --> 00:45:23.920]  And then you're obsessed with video games, shoot-em-ups, which most of the real shooters are.
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:27.641]  Not blaming video games, I'm saying you put a mentally ill person on drugs
[00:45:30.299 --> 00:45:37.465]  On mind control drugs, with shoot-em-up games, this is how you get a whack job, par excellence.
[00:45:37.465 --> 00:45:41.308]  They all have the same look in their eyes.
[00:45:41.308 --> 00:45:45.832]  And the drugs flip a switch in the brain that does it.
[00:45:45.832 --> 00:45:47.093]  Very simple.
[00:45:47.093 --> 00:45:49.615]  And they may take the drugs for five years and not have a problem.
[00:45:49.615 --> 00:45:54.498]  They take too much, take too little, mix something with it, and it's cuckoo land!
[00:45:54.498 --> 00:45:56.880]  It's crazy town!
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.342]  I've done methamphetamine
[00:45:59.622 --> 00:46:08.511]  Twice in high school, you're at a party, good-looking girl says, oh, try it, you'll love it, we can go drive to the beach, you know, you can stay up all night, it's gonna be great.
[00:46:08.511 --> 00:46:14.376]  And a day later, I'm at the beach doing bad things.
[00:46:14.376 --> 00:46:17.980]  Nothing really horrible, but, you know, not being a very nice person.
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:23.725]  Some of the few things I've done in my life that weren't very, and I'll tell you, I put cigarettes out on my hands.
[00:46:24.902 --> 00:46:27.765]  We're all sitting there on methamphetamine, putting cigarettes out.
[00:46:27.765 --> 00:46:32.570]  I have burns from those now, when I was like 15 years old.
[00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:33.771]  I would never do that.
[00:46:33.771 --> 00:46:36.673]  That's what hardcore drugs do, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:36.673 --> 00:46:38.875]  Did it twice.
[00:46:38.875 --> 00:46:40.317]  Twice.
[00:46:40.317 --> 00:46:42.159]  There's people that have done it thousands of times.
[00:46:42.159 --> 00:46:43.900]  They look like space aliens.
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:45.702]  I don't care if you're black or white or Hispanic.
[00:46:45.702 --> 00:46:49.746]  Walking down the street, I can go, that's a meth head, that's a meth head, that's a meth zombie.
[00:46:52.722 --> 00:46:56.504]  And it is the pharmacological system that's causing this.
[00:46:56.504 --> 00:46:58.185]  It's the main cause.
[00:46:58.185 --> 00:47:13.612]  Society generation, family unraveling, guns everywhere, that obviously adds to it, but you can't take my guns because there's a bunch of whacked out, drugged out people running around.
[00:47:13.612 --> 00:47:17.534]  It comes down to that.
[00:47:17.534 --> 00:47:20.055]  That's what hardcore drugs do.
[00:47:20.055 --> 00:47:21.796]  And I only share these stories to try to help people.
[00:47:22.751 --> 00:47:31.556]  I want to open the phones up on the Charleston situation that ties into the Virginia situation.
[00:47:31.556 --> 00:47:33.076]  They're trying to push a race war.
[00:47:33.076 --> 00:47:37.018]  This is clearly part of that with highly suggestible people.
[00:47:37.018 --> 00:47:46.003]  Obama is coming in with massive executive pushes outside of law where they're just announcing for more than a hundred reasons they're going to look at
[00:47:47.675 --> 00:47:56.282]  All the Social Security recipients, and if you're paralyzed from the chest down, or you do automatic money transfer, you're going to be declared incompetent.
[00:47:56.282 --> 00:48:05.388]  Outside of law, you used to have to have a big court hearing and a trial for that, but they're just going to declare you incompetent, and there's no judge, no jury.
[00:48:05.388 --> 00:48:10.793]  They just come and take your guns, or you can't buy guns, and it's happening to veterans all over the country.
[00:48:10.793 --> 00:48:15.816]  Now what they've done to veterans is going to be moved on to the older folks in America, 65 and up.
[00:48:18.226 --> 00:48:19.888]  And then it's going to move on to everybody else.
[00:48:19.888 --> 00:48:20.969]  This is how Tierney works.
[00:48:20.969 --> 00:48:23.111]  It targets certain groups and slices.
[00:48:23.111 --> 00:48:27.195]  And he's promising a whole bunch of other initiatives.
[00:48:27.195 --> 00:48:29.337]  And you can believe it's coming.
[00:48:29.337 --> 00:48:31.078]  You can believe it's here.
[00:48:31.078 --> 00:48:36.644]  You can believe this is the big push.
[00:48:36.644 --> 00:48:39.446]  And I predict there's going to be white people go out and kill black folks.
[00:48:39.446 --> 00:48:41.028]  There's going to be black folks killing white people.
[00:48:42.654 --> 00:48:45.581]  There's going to be more knockout games, there's going to be more cops getting shot.
[00:48:45.581 --> 00:48:49.209]  I mean, every couple days you hear about a cop getting shot sitting in their patrol car.
[00:48:50.248 --> 00:49:13.406]  And in almost every case, it's in a black inner city area, and the person does it because of the Black Lives Matter, or two dumb white kids come into Detroit to buy crack, and the guy takes them to a field and tortures them to death after he ties them up and says in court, because they're white, and Black Lives Matter, as if it's going to help black people to go out and kill two stupid crackhead white kids.
[00:49:13.406 --> 00:49:19.211]  As if those stupid crackheads were doing anything to you but trying to put money in your stupid pocket.
[00:49:20.814 --> 00:49:26.475]  But that's how whacked out this is.
[00:49:26.475 --> 00:49:27.315]  800-259-9231.
[00:49:27.315 --> 00:49:27.515]  800-259-9231.
[00:49:27.515 --> 00:49:35.777]  In any emergency, in any crisis, in any type of situation, the number one thing you need is to be prepared.
[00:49:35.777 --> 00:49:38.778]  And one of the best ways to do that is with colloidal silver.
[00:49:38.778 --> 00:49:49.500]  We have the best colloidal silver, already at the lowest price, 30 parts per million, made by the top lab in the country, private labeled for us, normally $30 when competitors sell the exact same thing.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.601]  We have it for $19.95.
[00:49:52.601 --> 00:49:54.682]  Sometimes it's $24.95.
[00:49:54.682 --> 00:49:59.444]  You can get 30% off when you buy one bottle or you can buy two bottles and get two free.
[00:49:59.444 --> 00:50:03.906]  This deal will end by Friday because I'm not going to allow it to sell out.
[00:50:03.906 --> 00:50:10.749]  It's going to go back to regular price and you won't be able to buy two and get two free on Friday.
[00:50:10.749 --> 00:50:12.310]  But I'm going to, again,
[00:50:13.632 --> 00:50:21.956]  Keep this deal up until Friday, and then I'm going to keep what we have left so we can not sell out until the next group comes in in October.
[00:50:21.956 --> 00:50:25.538]  Because it's a problem selling out of stuff, because I offer so many specials.
[00:50:26.644 --> 00:50:29.785]  Super Mel Vitality is back in stock.
[00:50:29.785 --> 00:50:33.707]  Back in stock is Secret 12, the best vitamin B12 out there.
[00:50:33.707 --> 00:50:38.109]  Methylcobalamin, pharmacological, pharmaceutical grade.
[00:50:38.109 --> 00:50:39.310]  Absolutely amazing.

[00:50:58.948 --> 00:51:05.032]  So I say to Mark at lunch, look, you know, I keep hearing from the government that, you know, they're worried someday ISIS may get here.
[00:51:05.032 --> 00:51:10.875]  Then I go, duh, Garland, Texas, Mohammed cartoon shooting, ISIS is already here.
[00:51:10.875 --> 00:51:13.097]  I'm not waiting for these people to defend me.
[00:51:13.097 --> 00:51:17.439]  If they don't know ISIS is here already, they got no clue, I'm taking care of myself.
[00:51:17.439 --> 00:51:23.983]  Guns80.com, AR-15 kits, 30 shot magazines, great prices, they've even got the Hillary special.

[00:51:58.317 --> 00:52:02.558]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:52:02.558 --> 00:52:03.179]  It's true.
[00:52:03.179 --> 00:52:07.320]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.701]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:52:09.701 --> 00:52:14.502]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[00:52:14.502 --> 00:52:21.865]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA.

[00:53:34.228 --> 00:53:38.569]  You're probably frustrated because your children don't listen to your words of warning.

[00:54:25.735 --> 00:54:29.759]  DrudgeReport.com is linked to the video that we've posted.
[00:54:29.759 --> 00:54:41.331]  The video is getting pulled down, but we'll have copies of it go up so they're not able to keep the public from seeing it, where he in first person shoots a woman.
[00:54:41.331 --> 00:54:43.393]  And you don't see any blood.
[00:54:43.393 --> 00:54:46.076]  It's really not even that graphic, but it shows how cold-blooded it is.
[00:54:47.849 --> 00:54:52.914]  And I wonder if the media is going to point out that he said he did it because they were racist.
[00:54:52.914 --> 00:54:56.817]  This is basically a Black Lives Matter spillover.
[00:54:56.817 --> 00:54:58.298]  I mean, this is what the media is pushing.
[00:54:58.298 --> 00:55:00.420]  This is what gets promoted on Twitter.
[00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:04.643]  Whites are being dehumanized as these monsters that deserve to die.
[00:55:04.643 --> 00:55:12.470]  And then DrudgeReport.com links to Infowars.com where you can see the video for yourself.
[00:55:13.632 --> 00:55:26.855]  And again, we're showing this not to be macabre, we're showing it because in the 60s we saw footage of kids being napalmed in Vietnam.
[00:55:26.855 --> 00:55:35.717]  So we have a right to see this, but yes, warning, it is graphic video.
[00:55:35.717 --> 00:55:41.839]  And we should probably also point out, and we do point out in the article, that this is being
[00:55:44.861 --> 00:55:54.423]  Pushed out of the news that he did this saying that she was racist and basically deserved it.
[00:55:54.423 --> 00:56:03.625]  Because they want to make it all about the Second Amendment and blame all gun owners, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, Native American, immigrant, whatever.
[00:56:03.625 --> 00:56:07.806]  They want to blame gun owners as if we collectively, it'd be like if somebody
[00:56:09.133 --> 00:56:11.796]  Ran over their neighbor's foot with a riding lawnmower.
[00:56:11.796 --> 00:56:17.583]  And they went on TV and went, you people that have riding lawnmowers, you are all to blame.
[00:56:17.583 --> 00:56:19.105]  How do you feel?
[00:56:19.105 --> 00:56:21.488]  Somebody killed somebody with a riding lawnmower.
[00:56:21.488 --> 00:56:25.593]  Hundreds of people a year get killed when psychos run over them with cars.
[00:56:25.593 --> 00:56:27.054]  Do we blame?
[00:56:27.054 --> 00:56:28.116]  There was a Toyota.
[00:56:30.618 --> 00:56:31.179]  Truck.
[00:56:31.179 --> 00:56:33.180]  A Toyota Tundra.
[00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:35.242]  And he ran over his wife with it.
[00:56:35.242 --> 00:56:37.884]  How do you truck owners feel, huh?
[00:56:37.884 --> 00:56:39.386]  You want to apologize?
[00:56:39.386 --> 00:56:41.768]  Want to pay some reparations?
[00:56:41.768 --> 00:56:43.069]  No.
[00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:46.172]  I am individually responsible for what I do.
[00:56:46.172 --> 00:56:54.579]  And the hallmark of a totalitarian society in every case is that you're collectively blamed for what individuals do.
[00:56:54.579 --> 00:56:55.379]  In Russia.
[00:56:55.379 --> 00:56:57.161]  In Nazi Germany.
[00:56:57.161 --> 00:56:58.102]  You would be blamed.
[00:57:00.427 --> 00:57:10.651]  In every case, for what your neighbor did, so that you could then be pressured to put cultural pressure on people to go along with the party.
[00:57:10.651 --> 00:57:17.394]  Oh, if your neighbor got caught doing something anti-Hitler, and you didn't know about it, you didn't report it, you're now under suspicion.
[00:57:17.394 --> 00:57:21.976]  You might get picked up, you might get arrested.
[00:57:21.976 --> 00:57:29.619]  We're gonna go to break, and we're gonna come back and talk to Ben, and Buckley, and Kavik, Robert,
[00:57:30.598 --> 00:57:33.159]  Rob and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:57:33.159 --> 00:57:36.660]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:48.165]  We have Steve Quayle scheduled today, but I was going to try to move him to another day because he's going to cover a bunch of geopolitical issues, but unable to get a hold of him, so I'm not sure what's going to be happening with that.
[00:57:49.085 --> 00:57:59.255]  We do have a guest popping in in studio as well, but regardless, I'm going to be taking a lot of your phone calls, so please have your point and your comment ready on this whole situation.
[00:57:59.255 --> 00:58:04.800]  While we're busy focused in on this, a lot of other things are happening as well.
[00:58:05.595 --> 00:58:14.779]  And of course we also need to remember that the economy is in a designed, contrived, engineered meltdown.
[00:58:14.779 --> 00:58:27.646]  And that pretty much everything else being promoted and pushed is a distraction from the fact that TPP and these other global government systems are being expanded right in front of us.
[00:58:27.646 --> 00:58:33.849]  But there's no doubt the next big launch to come after our guns from executive action outside of law
[00:58:35.097 --> 00:58:35.959]  Is now coming.
[00:58:35.959 --> 00:58:36.980]  So brace for that.
[00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:40.285]  The battle for the republic is now.
[00:58:40.285 --> 00:58:43.690]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:45.913]  Visit GCNlive.com today.

[00:58:59.907 --> 00:59:04.688]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:59:04.688 --> 00:59:08.269]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[00:59:18.451 --> 00:59:19.571]  BrainForce is here.
[00:59:19.571 --> 00:59:21.792]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:59:21.792 --> 00:59:26.794]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:59:26.794 --> 00:59:30.095]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:59:30.095 --> 00:59:33.556]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:59:33.556 --> 00:59:35.536]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:59:35.536 --> 00:59:39.637]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean.
[00:59:39.637 --> 00:59:45.239]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:50.723 --> 00:59:53.331]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.693 --> 01:00:05.994]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.994 --> 01:00:07.776]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.776 --> 01:00:09.537]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.537 --> 01:00:11.118]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.118 --> 01:00:12.660]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:16.863]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:28.733]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.733 --> 01:00:32.296]  How long until the news comes out that the Virginia shooter
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:37.463]  Was on psychotropic-type drugs.
[01:00:37.463 --> 01:00:40.505]  I think it'll come out in the next two days.
[01:00:40.505 --> 01:00:42.107]  Or they might be successful in suppressing it.
[01:00:42.107 --> 01:00:44.608]  Sometimes it comes out in a year.
[01:00:44.608 --> 01:00:46.130]  He's in critical condition.
[01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:47.190]  They said he was dead.
[01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:50.233]  At about 10.55, the police had him surrounded.
[01:00:50.233 --> 01:00:52.415]  Reportedly shot himself in the head.
[01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:59.020]  Bryce Williams was the name of the reporters who reportedly did this after losing his job.
[01:01:00.543 --> 01:01:07.024]  Vester Flanagan was his real name, worked at WDBJ.
[01:01:07.024 --> 01:01:16.666]  And I've already shown the footage, I'm not going to show it again, of him in first person, like a video game, going around shooting people.
[01:01:16.666 --> 01:01:29.609]  Shooting the cameraman, shooting the woman, waiting until the camera pans back to the reporter so it'd be on tape, trying to get her to turn around so she would see him, and he just has that typical whacked-out look in his eye of these type of shooters.
[01:01:31.784 --> 01:01:37.128]  And the truth is, you can't stop people like this.
[01:01:37.128 --> 01:01:40.650]  You will have a small percentage of people that go out and kill people.
[01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:51.658]  Every week or so in Japan and China, we hear about, you know, 15 killed, 5 killed, 7 killed by a man with a homemade knife, or a man with machete, or a man with sword.
[01:01:51.658 --> 01:01:53.579]  I mean, that's what happens.
[01:01:53.579 --> 01:02:01.105]  A whacked out person who's got the will to kill people with a samurai sword, you can go into a room of 15, 20 people and kill them.
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:09.245]  In fact, a lot of cases, swords, per whack, can be more deadly than a gun.
[01:02:09.245 --> 01:02:16.670]  Because a gun sometimes, the bullet goes in a weird direction, but with a sword, chop an arm right off, a lot of folks will die from that, because it's a clean cut.
[01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:23.996]  It's one thing if your arm gets mangled in a car or something, and then you're bleeding, but it's able to clot up.
[01:02:23.996 --> 01:02:29.620]  But a clean cut, or get stabbed in the stomach by a big old sword, or a big old butcher knife,
[01:02:32.022 --> 01:02:33.404]  You're dead.
[01:02:33.404 --> 01:02:37.449]  Just as often or more so from the numbers I've seen than with a firearm.
[01:02:37.449 --> 01:02:42.997]  Now if I shoot you with my 500 Smith & Wesson, it might be a little bit different.
[01:02:44.116 --> 01:02:47.558]  Okay, this is a short little No Man's Land segment.
[01:02:47.558 --> 01:02:54.322]  I'm going to come back at the beginning of the next segment and go right to... Did you pronounce that Kavik in Canada?
[01:02:54.322 --> 01:02:56.844]  Buckley, Robert, Kivick.
[01:02:56.844 --> 01:03:02.207]  Kivick, Buckley, Robert, Rob, Ben, and others that are patiently holding.
[01:03:02.207 --> 01:03:08.451]  And I want to ask the listeners, am I wrong saying that we shouldn't land the Second Amendment?
[01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:11.533]  I mean, obviously we shouldn't.
[01:03:11.533 --> 01:03:12.814]  Crime with guns is way down.
[01:03:14.468 --> 01:03:16.830]  But the mainstream media is predictably doing that.
[01:03:16.830 --> 01:03:27.398]  Well then how do we force the discussion of the fact that White House controlled media, from Media Matters to CNBC to MSNBC to CNN,
[01:03:29.551 --> 01:03:48.700]  Not so much CNBC, but they do some of it, are pushing racial division narratives and acting like all the stress and all the problems in America isn't the economy, isn't the GMO, isn't all the screen time, isn't 20% of the public on hardcore big pharma drugs, mass murder, suicide pills.
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.381]  No!
[01:03:50.381 --> 01:03:57.084]  You're not getting ahead because racist white people are conspiring against you because you're black.
[01:03:57.084 --> 01:03:57.424]  And then,
[01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:03.796]  White people that aren't doing too good, generally, they hear this and think it's ridiculous.
[01:04:03.796 --> 01:04:05.639]  They've been treated racially bad.
[01:04:05.639 --> 01:04:07.621]  They've been beaten up in high school.
[01:04:07.621 --> 01:04:09.323]  That's the classic MO.
[01:04:09.323 --> 01:04:13.489]  They decide to get a gun and go shoot a bunch of black people.
[01:04:13.489 --> 01:04:14.570]  And it's just so stupid.
[01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:15.611]  It's like we're two bulls.
[01:04:16.778 --> 01:04:42.470]  in the arena and you've got the matador with a red cape or two red capes manipulating us both to run into each other but instead of being one bull the matador's got a sword behind it that he pulls the cape out of the way and the bull goes on to the sword instead he's got two capes like this when he pulls them back the bulls ram straight into each other head-on
[01:04:43.882 --> 01:04:45.444]  They're killing themselves.
[01:04:45.444 --> 01:04:56.174]  Because make no mistake, this whole Black Lives Matter, Race War, George Soros situation is a matador with a cape driving us onto the sword.
[01:04:58.735 --> 01:05:04.599]  We now know why StemXpress was so desperate to censor the undercover Planned Parenthood video featuring its CEO.
[01:05:04.599 --> 01:05:16.407]  The law prohibits organ and tissue donors from selling for profit, yet solicitation materials from StemXpress repeatedly tout how financially profitable and rewarding and beneficial it can be to the fiscal growth for abortion clinics.
[01:05:16.587 --> 01:05:23.894]  And when asked what they can do to help clinics that aren't profiting, the CEO is astonished and says she doesn't know any who aren't profiting.
[01:05:23.894 --> 01:05:25.576]  You want to say this is about women's health?
[01:05:25.576 --> 01:05:31.842]  She talks about the contamination of samples with staff due to unsanitary clinic conditions being a repeated problem.
[01:05:32.102 --> 01:05:37.328]  And the StemXpress CEO talks about the stigma of delivering butchered baby parts to labs.
[01:05:37.328 --> 01:05:38.249]  How they freak out.
[01:05:38.249 --> 01:05:40.311]  How they have meltdowns when they get a whole head.
[01:05:40.311 --> 01:05:44.996]  How they'll request hands and feet to be removed from limbs so they don't have to confront what it is.
[01:05:44.996 --> 01:05:47.739]  But then she comments, but we know what it is.
[01:05:47.739 --> 01:05:52.344]  For that reason, she says, many are turning to adult stem cells or bone marrow.
[01:05:52.344 --> 01:05:53.025]  And she concludes,
[01:05:53.345 --> 01:05:55.466]  You're either in the cause or you're not.
[01:05:55.466 --> 01:05:58.507]  This is David Knight reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:05:58.507 --> 01:06:04.430]  Supermail Vitality is InfoWarsLife.com's number one selling product for a good reason.

[01:06:58.482 --> 01:06:59.723]  Another major health threat.
[01:06:59.723 --> 01:07:04.705]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:07:04.705 --> 01:07:07.387]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:07:07.387 --> 01:07:14.430]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:17.412]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:07:17.412 --> 01:07:20.373]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:07:20.373 --> 01:07:22.394]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:07:22.394 --> 01:07:25.216]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:07:25.316 --> 01:07:31.038]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:07:31.038 --> 01:07:34.540]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:37.641]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[01:07:56.211 --> 01:08:03.342]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.342 --> 01:08:06.668]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:15.181]  Well, the controlled globalist media is at it again.
[01:08:15.181 --> 01:08:18.482]  They're trying to create unified mass guilt.
[01:08:18.482 --> 01:08:36.668]  No matter what color you are or where you're from, that if you own a gun, a firearm, protect yourself, protect your family, in these uncertain times, that it's your fault that another whack job went postal and went and killed a cameraman and a female reporter in Virginia.
[01:08:38.206 --> 01:08:41.888]  And this guy was live tweeting himself up until the time he shot himself.
[01:08:41.888 --> 01:08:43.849]  He's now in critical condition.
[01:08:43.849 --> 01:08:45.390]  Vester Flanagan was his real name.
[01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:52.154]  Bryce Williams was his TV reporter name.
[01:08:52.154 --> 01:08:56.216]  And predictably, the media is saying, restrict the Second Amendment.
[01:08:56.216 --> 01:08:58.898]  Obama, do something with executive action.
[01:08:58.898 --> 01:09:00.499]  Gun owners, this is all your fault.
[01:09:03.203 --> 01:09:09.824]  Projecting guilt on the general public and covering up the fact he sent out tweets saying she made racist comments.
[01:09:09.824 --> 01:09:12.025]  I reported her to the EEOC.
[01:09:12.025 --> 01:09:17.346]  And now some people are saying, well, if she was racist, you know, she deserved to die.
[01:09:17.346 --> 01:09:19.526]  That type of stuff's on Twitter.
[01:09:19.526 --> 01:09:23.007]  You can see the graphic video at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:23.007 --> 01:09:27.247]  The easiest place to find it is DrudgeReport.com.
[01:09:27.247 --> 01:09:29.108]  The shooter himself shot video.
[01:09:29.108 --> 01:09:29.928]  Pretty good camera guy.
[01:09:29.928 --> 01:09:31.028]  He'd done that first in media.
[01:09:32.941 --> 01:09:56.992]  As he holds the gun out in front of him and videotapes, and then he shoots her and then shoots the cameraman, identified Vester L. Flanagan, post video of shooting, warning, very graphic, Allison made racist comments, he went on to say, update, shooter himself in critical condition, NYPD beefing up security at all media outlets after news shootings.
[01:09:59.244 --> 01:10:08.238]  Meanwhile, San Francisco has the same problem that government buildings have.
[01:10:08.238 --> 01:10:10.722]  How to solve the city's public pooping problem.
[01:10:11.567 --> 01:10:16.850]  They're not sure why the more liberal a city it is, the more public pooping there is.
[01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:18.851]  And I'm not trying to be funny here.
[01:10:18.851 --> 01:10:20.852]  This is part of the mass mental illness.
[01:10:20.852 --> 01:10:34.279]  Of why is there more homeless people, more degradation, more ugliness, more sickeningness, and it's just all part of people that are spoiled brats, want to get weirder and weirder, and just society starts to collapse.
[01:10:34.279 --> 01:10:41.003]  And I'm telling you, San Francisco is a beautiful city, but since I was there as a young child and then as a young man, it is a pit.
[01:10:42.079 --> 01:10:43.420]  Compared to what it used to be like.
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:48.546]  It is really gross and it is really going downhill and California is really rotting.
[01:10:48.546 --> 01:10:55.393]  And then you go to nice areas like Santa Cruz or places like Newport Beach down in the south.
[01:10:55.393 --> 01:10:57.555]  Beautiful, beautiful, nice people.
[01:10:57.555 --> 01:11:04.603]  But then you get around the liberal degradation and it's like an open sore on a dog with maggots dripping out.
[01:11:05.163 --> 01:11:09.944]  And I'm not trying to be gross here, but I mean, these people are a curse!
[01:11:09.944 --> 01:11:12.024]  I mean, you just start realizing it.
[01:11:12.024 --> 01:11:13.445]  They jack up taxes.
[01:11:13.445 --> 01:11:16.545]  They fund the most degenerate people.
[01:11:16.545 --> 01:11:19.466]  They fund degradation because they love it.
[01:11:19.466 --> 01:11:20.826]  They are aberrant.
[01:11:20.826 --> 01:11:22.266]  They are a problem.
[01:11:22.266 --> 01:11:23.266]  They are hypocrites.
[01:11:23.266 --> 01:11:25.847]  Hillary Clinton has all these guns and all these bodyguards.
[01:11:25.847 --> 01:11:29.868]  She's out in the news saying, restrict the Second Amendment and all this other garbage.
[01:11:29.868 --> 01:11:31.828]  It makes my blood boil.
[01:11:34.246 --> 01:11:36.289]  We told you this was coming six, seven years ago.
[01:11:36.289 --> 01:11:38.331]  They said we were conspiracy theorists.
[01:11:38.331 --> 01:11:46.682]  North Dakota, first state to legalize armed drones for the police.
[01:11:46.682 --> 01:11:50.167]  Man indicted for firing a shotgun and a drone hovering near his home.
[01:11:55.165 --> 01:11:56.066]  That's some of the news.
[01:11:56.066 --> 01:11:58.607]  You go to Infowars.com.
[01:11:58.607 --> 01:12:02.170]  Clinton exploits Virginia shooting to call for gun legislation.
[01:12:02.170 --> 01:12:02.811]  Curtin MO.
[01:12:02.811 --> 01:12:03.631]  Graphic.
[01:12:03.631 --> 01:12:07.634]  Shocking complete video shot from Virginian gunman's point of view.
[01:12:07.634 --> 01:12:11.317]  Hey guys, Dew has the graphics from the Justice Department.
[01:12:11.317 --> 01:12:13.318]  I know you have them as a package as well.
[01:12:13.318 --> 01:12:16.560]  Can we find and play the numbers from 92 to 2012?
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.903]  They haven't done new numbers since with the 51% drop.
[01:12:21.946 --> 01:12:25.211]  That's what Fox says it's a 51% drop.
[01:12:25.211 --> 01:12:29.296]  Professor Lott, one of the top statisticians in the world, says it's 61.
[01:12:29.296 --> 01:12:32.380]  Whatever, I'll take 51 and not argue.
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:33.382]  51% drop in crime.
[01:12:33.382 --> 01:12:36.927]  We need to just keep hammering that and show how they're creating the perception.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:40.882]  That there's all this increased crime with guns.
[01:12:40.882 --> 01:12:43.865]  The truth is good people are stopping the bad people.
[01:12:43.865 --> 01:12:44.886]  We're scaring them.
[01:12:44.886 --> 01:12:47.828]  After you pass concealed carry in a state, look at the numbers.
[01:12:47.828 --> 01:12:52.393]  Massive drop between 25 and 50 plus percent within a couple years.
[01:12:53.504 --> 01:12:57.426]  In Texas, in Florida, and other states, Africans still carry one in.
[01:12:57.426 --> 01:13:03.289]  It works like a charm, because a criminal is going to carjack you and doesn't care if there's laws against guns.
[01:13:03.289 --> 01:13:11.733]  Law-abiding citizens won't carry a gun most of the time, unless they've already been mugged or attacked, then they'll break the law, statistics show, to protect themselves.
[01:13:11.733 --> 01:13:16.955]  So after you legalize it, the carjackings stop very quick, because people get blown away.
[01:13:16.955 --> 01:13:20.817]  I love the fact that women jog with fanny packs in parks where they get robbed.
[01:13:21.738 --> 01:13:26.300]  And then after a few women shoot a few thugs, it stops.
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:30.103]  And my daughters are getting good with guns.
[01:13:30.103 --> 01:13:31.423]  That's what it's all about.
[01:13:31.423 --> 01:13:32.544]  Your wife.
[01:13:32.544 --> 01:13:35.545]  That's true feminism, but they don't want that.
[01:13:35.545 --> 01:13:38.027]  Now, I mentioned this before the break that I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[01:13:39.485 --> 01:13:39.945]  And that's it.
[01:13:39.945 --> 01:13:50.731]  If you see George Soros in the White House funding Black Lives Matter, trying to act like black people are being targeted, and that's the number one issue in the country, don't get mad at the corrupt central government.
[01:13:50.731 --> 01:13:51.812]  Don't get mad at the Federal Reserve.
[01:13:51.812 --> 01:13:54.674]  Don't get mad at Obama and the doubling of black unemployment.
[01:13:54.674 --> 01:13:57.855]  The problem is police, and there are some problems.
[01:13:57.855 --> 01:14:00.037]  That's part of the government, but they focus only on the bottom.
[01:14:00.777 --> 01:14:06.041]  And then act like rioting and shooting and attacking and burning is going to fix something.
[01:14:06.041 --> 01:14:11.545]  And then imply whites are inherently racist, whites are inherently bad.
[01:14:11.545 --> 01:14:12.485]  They're a problem.
[01:14:12.485 --> 01:14:16.628]  So, knockout games, shootings, all of this intensifies.
[01:14:16.628 --> 01:14:19.410]  Then a crazy white person feels like he's under attack.
[01:14:19.410 --> 01:14:21.191]  He buys into it.
[01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:24.794]  The Dylan Ruff character at the Charleston shooting goes in and shoots people.
[01:14:26.772 --> 01:14:33.456]  Now you've got this guy who's filing EEOC things left and right and leaving TV stations in Florida and other parts of the country.
[01:14:33.456 --> 01:14:42.901]  He lands in Virginia, becomes successful, has some type of problems, leaves the TV station.
[01:14:42.901 --> 01:14:44.241]  Now there are the statistics.
[01:14:44.241 --> 01:14:45.582]  Massive drop.
[01:14:45.582 --> 01:14:47.783]  As guns increase, crime drops.
[01:14:47.783 --> 01:14:52.746]  And then suddenly, whether she said something racist or not, did she deserve to get shot in the back?
[01:14:54.488 --> 01:15:00.052]  If I claim a black person said something racist to me, do I get to shoot him in the back?
[01:15:00.052 --> 01:15:05.897]  No, it's inherently very similar to what Roof did.
[01:15:05.897 --> 01:15:11.641]  And will they be able to hype further escalations out of this?
[01:15:11.641 --> 01:15:15.244]  And I used the analogy earlier.
[01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:21.168]  The globalist will put a political football issue out there that's the red cape.
[01:15:21.168 --> 01:15:22.049]  The bull sees it.
[01:15:23.803 --> 01:15:40.315]  Tries to attack it, and the Matador might spend 20-30 minutes, depending on how good he is, risking his life to barely turn out of the way as the sharpened horns with the multi-thousand pound creature runs right by him.
[01:15:40.315 --> 01:15:42.937]  Many Matadors have been killed, obviously, every year.
[01:15:42.937 --> 01:15:46.159]  11 people died in the running of the Bulls this year in Spain alone.
[01:15:48.052 --> 01:15:50.717]  And I like the fact they can't ban it because it's pure political correctness.
[01:15:50.717 --> 01:15:55.025]  It's an ancient cultural sport, thousands of years old, really going back to the Colosseum in Rome.
[01:15:55.025 --> 01:15:59.312]  And I'm not endorsing all the things that happened in Rome, but, you know, this is somebody putting their life on the line.
[01:15:59.991 --> 01:16:03.533]  We're showing some footage of one of Spain's most famous matadors right now.
[01:16:03.533 --> 01:16:09.436]  And then they start throwing little barbed hooks into the bull's back to infuriate him even more.
[01:16:09.436 --> 01:16:12.537]  And then finally they put a sword behind the red cape.
[01:16:12.537 --> 01:16:18.100]  And when the bull charges in, the matador drives the sword all the way into the bull's heart.
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:29.244]  Which is incredibly skillful, incredibly hard to stab through a foot of meat and bone and ribs with perfect targeting, a true work of art to get it into the heart.
[01:16:29.244 --> 01:16:33.085]  Then the meat's given to poor people.
[01:16:33.085 --> 01:16:35.286]  This is just ancient human hunting.
[01:16:35.286 --> 01:16:40.068]  Because ancients would drive spears into the chest of bulls.
[01:16:40.068 --> 01:16:44.430]  That's how far back this goes, tens of thousands of years into human history.
[01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:47.751]  And the matador turns his back on the bull, enticing him to come in.
[01:16:49.008 --> 01:16:54.594]  Now, the globalists do this all the time, try to bait people into things, and that's what Black Lives Matter is.
[01:16:54.594 --> 01:16:55.414]  But it's more than that.
[01:16:55.414 --> 01:17:02.121]  It's like a matador with two red capes getting two bulls to run into each other, killing themselves.
[01:17:02.121 --> 01:17:06.966]  This is, all this is, is divide-and-conquer manipulation.
[01:17:06.966 --> 01:17:12.752]  And the black races, the white races, from their perspectives, they see real stuff that's going on, real problems.
[01:17:14.445 --> 01:17:37.866]  But it's a false paradigm in that it's been manipulated, and statistically, even if you got real beefs with white people, or real beefs with black people, or real beefs with Hispanics, or vice versa, overall, the globalists are geoengineering, they're putting poison in the water, they're force-feeding us GMO, they won't let us label stuff, they're opening up the borders, they're launching all these wars, they're funding Al-Qaeda,
[01:17:38.567 --> 01:17:47.256]  They're funding Fast and Furious, they're cold-blooded, they're evil, and they're pushing all this because it helps them have us at each other's throats.
[01:17:47.256 --> 01:17:50.700]  And I know that's elementary.
[01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:54.264]  But that's why I reached out to the racist black groups and have been told to go to Hades.
[01:17:55.666 --> 01:18:03.777]  It's why I've reached out to people like David Duke and tried to actually have a real discussion with him and not just get in a fight with him, but try to explain to him the larger paradigm.
[01:18:03.777 --> 01:18:06.861]  And because I didn't agree with him, his acolytes now hate my guts.
[01:18:06.861 --> 01:18:08.423]  Well, don't worry, I won't talk to him again.
[01:18:09.423 --> 01:18:13.706]  I won't reach out to try to, you know, just do the right thing and be chivalrous here.
[01:18:13.706 --> 01:18:15.087]  Okay, fine.
[01:18:15.087 --> 01:18:18.149]  The point is if people want their ignorance, they're going to have it.
[01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:23.353]  But if you want to stop most of the mass shootings, get people off the suicide mass murder pills.
[01:18:23.353 --> 01:18:25.515]  We're going to go to break with this clip from Piers Morgan.
[01:18:25.515 --> 01:18:26.756]  Haven't played this in a while.
[01:18:26.756 --> 01:18:28.977]  We're going to come back with your call straight ahead.
[01:18:28.977 --> 01:18:34.981]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:18:34.981 --> 01:18:38.404]  And then after we play this clip, we will, uh,
[01:18:40.441 --> 01:18:43.182]  Got a break.
[01:18:43.182 --> 01:18:44.262]  How about Prozac?
[01:18:44.262 --> 01:18:46.543]  You know the number one... Oh, that's a big sponsor, isn't it?
[01:18:46.543 --> 01:18:47.583]  Or that whole class of drugs.
[01:18:47.583 --> 01:18:48.323]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:18:48.323 --> 01:18:49.983]  Oh, whoa, gotta cut that off, don't you?
[01:18:49.983 --> 01:18:51.984]  Don't want to talk about the U.S.
[01:18:51.984 --> 01:18:57.685]  number one cause of death is suicide now because they give people suicide mass murder pills.
[01:18:57.685 --> 01:18:58.045]  Calm down.
[01:18:58.045 --> 01:19:03.347]  Your answer is get more money of a psychiatrist or psychologist to put more crazy people on drugs that make them kill people, Pierce.
[01:19:03.347 --> 01:19:04.567]  Let's try and have a debate here.
[01:19:04.867 --> 01:19:05.367]  Yeah.
[01:19:05.367 --> 01:19:06.308]  Answer me this question.
[01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:08.070]  I'm sick of the same old script here, bud.
[01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:09.111]  It's fine, bud.
[01:19:09.111 --> 01:19:10.191]  How about Prozac?
[01:19:10.191 --> 01:19:12.473]  You know the number one... Oh, that's a big sponsor, isn't it?
[01:19:12.473 --> 01:19:13.514]  Or that whole class of drugs.
[01:19:13.514 --> 01:19:14.235]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:19:14.235 --> 01:19:16.016]  Oh, whoa, gotta cut that off, don't you?
[01:19:16.016 --> 01:19:17.918]  Don't want to talk about the U.S.
[01:19:17.918 --> 01:19:23.622]  number one cause of death is suicide now because they give people suicide mass murder pills.
[01:19:23.622 --> 01:19:23.983]  Calm down.
[01:19:23.983 --> 01:19:29.227]  Your answer is give more money to the psychiatrists and psychologists to put more crazy people on drugs that make them kill people, Pierce.
[01:19:29.227 --> 01:19:30.528]  Let's try and have a debate here.
[01:19:30.788 --> 01:19:31.288]  Yeah.
[01:19:31.288 --> 01:19:32.289]  Answer me this question.
[01:19:32.289 --> 01:19:33.849]  I'm sick of the same old script here, bud.
[01:19:33.849 --> 01:19:37.370]  It's fine, bud.
[01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:38.511]  And that says it all.
[01:19:38.511 --> 01:19:41.812]  Our little TriCaster seized up in there, not the fault of the crew.
[01:19:41.812 --> 01:19:50.215]  We'll be right back on the other side, and I promise, I'm going to callers in Canada, Missouri, Maine, Missouri, Missouri, Missouri, a lot of calls from Missouri.
[01:19:50.215 --> 01:19:50.795]  We'll be back.
[01:19:50.795 --> 01:19:52.355]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:19:52.355 --> 01:19:56.397]  What are they diverting us with right now, though, making this the number one story?
[01:19:56.397 --> 01:19:57.217]  What are they diverting us?
[01:20:01.198 --> 01:20:03.258]  We are a survival company.
[01:20:03.258 --> 01:20:07.619]  We manufacture our own line of level 3 and level 3A body armor.
[01:20:07.619 --> 01:20:11.500]  We proudly make our armor 100% in America.

[01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:16.861]  About $125 cheaper than our nearest competitor.

[01:21:58.266 --> 01:22:02.472]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:02.472 --> 01:22:03.113]  It's true.
[01:22:03.113 --> 01:22:07.259]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:07.259 --> 01:22:09.642]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.

[01:23:59.687 --> 01:24:05.490]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:05.490 --> 01:24:14.616]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:14.616 --> 01:24:16.497]  Obviously I'm wound up.
[01:24:16.497 --> 01:24:19.659]  This season of craziness has really got me on edge.
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:27.504]  There's a battle going on in the controlled media right now to blame the Second Amendment and collectively blame all of us.
[01:24:27.504 --> 01:24:34.649]  I've had a whole bunch of different TV networks, newspapers, you name it, are calling, emailing, saying, we want comment from Alex Jones.
[01:24:34.649 --> 01:24:37.552]  What does he say now?
[01:24:37.552 --> 01:24:40.293]  It'd be like if I raised cattle.
[01:24:40.293 --> 01:24:43.596]  Cattle kill hundreds of people a year, speaking of bulls, in the U.S.
[01:24:43.596 --> 01:24:44.556]  alone.
[01:24:44.556 --> 01:24:49.160]  And somebody had a bull get out of their pen and kill a five-year-old kid.
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:50.621]  That happened in Texas just last year.
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:53.881]  You got cows too!
[01:24:53.881 --> 01:24:55.962]  How you feeling after that cow did that?
[01:24:55.962 --> 01:24:57.543]  It's like, well, that happens.
[01:24:57.543 --> 01:24:58.384]  That's part of life.
[01:24:58.384 --> 01:25:01.185]  I'm sad, but it's not my fault.
[01:25:01.185 --> 01:25:02.326]  It's not my bull.
[01:25:02.326 --> 01:25:09.430]  I mean, it's the same thing that they sit there with a straight face and collectively blame gun owners.
[01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:10.771]  It's just crazy.
[01:25:10.771 --> 01:25:13.253]  It's time to get back in their faces.
[01:25:13.253 --> 01:25:17.015]  Then meanwhile, this is obviously some mentally unstable whack job
[01:25:18.493 --> 01:25:21.756]  Who said that she was racist so she deserved it.
[01:25:21.756 --> 01:25:31.624]  So clearly you've got a lot stronger link there than blaming gun owners to say the media pushing racial division as a distraction, they're to blame.
[01:25:31.624 --> 01:25:41.172]  So I'm going to say MSNBC, CNN and others pushing race war are to blame for the Virginia TV shooting.
[01:25:41.172 --> 01:25:43.213]  I want to tweet that out right now.
[01:25:43.213 --> 01:25:46.977]  MSNBC and CNN
[01:25:50.137 --> 01:25:55.599]  contributed to this shooting by pushing race war, not the Second Amendment.
[01:25:55.599 --> 01:25:58.720]  I don't know how you put that all into a tweet.
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.381]  The problem is condensing it.
[01:26:01.381 --> 01:26:16.747]  MSNBC and Dinosaur Media are responsible for pushing race war and causing this latest shooting, not the Second Amendment.
[01:26:17.441 --> 01:26:21.284]  I want to tweet that at real Alex Jones, because that's what this comes down to.
[01:26:21.284 --> 01:26:23.446]  Okay, I'm ranting.
[01:26:23.446 --> 01:26:24.547]  Who's up first here, John?
[01:26:24.547 --> 01:26:27.769]  Who's been holding the longest?
[01:26:27.769 --> 01:26:29.551]  Kaivik in Canada, you're up first.
[01:26:29.551 --> 01:26:30.632]  Thank you for calling in today.
[01:26:30.632 --> 01:26:33.494]  Hi, Alex.
[01:26:33.494 --> 01:26:34.275]  Can you hear me?
[01:26:34.275 --> 01:26:35.095]  I sure can.
[01:26:35.095 --> 01:26:35.456]  Go ahead.
[01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:38.692]  Well, greetings once again from Canada, Alex.
[01:26:38.692 --> 01:26:42.835]  Thanks for taking my call again, and thanks to you and your whole crew for all your good works.
[01:26:42.835 --> 01:26:44.597]  Thank you.
[01:26:44.597 --> 01:26:47.239]  And I'm glad you enjoyed Toronto Island.
[01:26:47.239 --> 01:26:48.780]  It is a beautiful place, isn't it?
[01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:50.141]  I'm gonna bring my kids back up there.
[01:26:50.141 --> 01:26:50.742]  Very beautiful.
[01:26:50.742 --> 01:26:52.903]  I really like Toronto.
[01:26:52.903 --> 01:26:54.184]  Yeah, it's a great town.
[01:26:54.184 --> 01:26:55.625]  It really is.
[01:26:55.625 --> 01:27:03.552]  Now, talking about the shooting, as a Canadian, I can assure you that handgun restrictions will not stop crazy or stupid people from shooting other people.
[01:27:04.381 --> 01:27:11.064]  It's almost impossible in Canada to get a CCW, and yet there's still handgun shootings every single week up here.
[01:27:11.064 --> 01:27:16.946]  Wait a minute, are you saying that spoons don't make people fat?
[01:27:16.946 --> 01:27:22.128]  You know, and alcohol doesn't make people crash into trees.
[01:27:22.128 --> 01:27:22.568]  Apparently.
[01:27:24.855 --> 01:27:28.797]  I mean, it's so obvious that Rosie O'Donnell's not to blame for being fat.
[01:27:28.797 --> 01:27:33.340]  It is the fact that spoons in her cupboard made her eat all that food.
[01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:35.501]  Same thing with Michael Moore.
[01:27:35.501 --> 01:27:36.422]  Absolutely.
[01:27:36.422 --> 01:27:47.448]  And you know, I think this became such a big story so quickly because it's the first time since Bud Dwyer and Christine Chubbett killed themselves on live TV and we now have the internet to stoke the flames.
[01:27:48.539 --> 01:27:52.302]  Oh yeah, this is going to be the biggest news story for a few weeks and it's going to distract.
[01:27:52.302 --> 01:27:57.587]  That's why I'm sending Joe Biggs and David Knight right now on an airplane.
[01:27:57.587 --> 01:28:01.390]  The problem is, it takes two hours once they get to an airport to get out there.
[01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:03.912]  So they won't be out there until like 10 o'clock tonight.
[01:28:03.912 --> 01:28:06.654]  But the rest of the mainstream media won't get there until this afternoon.
[01:28:06.654 --> 01:28:11.478]  So we're going to be there covering the media spectacle and their propaganda.
[01:28:12.299 --> 01:28:19.764]  And also getting questions in on real issues, like was he on psychotropic drugs?
[01:28:19.764 --> 01:28:21.725]  Because the cops will want to tell us.
[01:28:21.725 --> 01:28:23.467]  We're going to be there talking to the police.
[01:28:23.467 --> 01:28:28.230]  That's what Joe Biggs is being sent to do, along with David Knight, and to really do real journalism.
[01:28:28.230 --> 01:28:35.314]  Cover what the media is doing, cover what the Democratic operatives are doing, and then talk to the police and others and get the scoop.
[01:28:35.314 --> 01:28:37.836]  Was this guy on psychotropic drugs?
[01:28:37.836 --> 01:28:40.398]  Do bears go to the bathroom in the woods?
[01:28:40.398 --> 01:28:41.499]  Do Tweety Birds sing?
[01:28:42.359 --> 01:28:46.245]  I mean, every time I predict they're on it, they always are.
[01:28:46.245 --> 01:28:51.192]  What do you think the chances are this guy wasn't on some drugs?
[01:28:51.192 --> 01:28:51.552]  Oh, no.
[01:28:51.552 --> 01:28:54.497]  All you gotta do is look at his pictures and read his tweets and whatnot.
[01:28:54.497 --> 01:28:55.638]  This guy was unhinged.
[01:28:55.638 --> 01:28:56.740]  He was completely unhinged.
[01:28:57.150 --> 01:29:04.355]  You know, as this was going on, there was a bunch of me and a whole bunch of InfoWarriors in an InfoWars IRC chat room.
[01:29:04.355 --> 01:29:13.921]  Which, by the way, I think you should get rid of the comment sections on the articles and put a live chat or a login to Planet InfoWars so we can have real-time conversations.
[01:29:13.921 --> 01:29:18.404]  The comment sections have just become chaos since the David Duke interview.
[01:29:18.404 --> 01:29:20.345]  It's just complete nonsense.
[01:29:20.345 --> 01:29:21.726]  Well, that's actually good, though.
[01:29:21.726 --> 01:29:25.288]  That just brings us more traffic, and I like that controversy.
[01:29:27.481 --> 01:29:32.182]  I mean, if people think me giving somebody two hours on air to put out their ideas of censorship, good.
[01:29:32.182 --> 01:29:35.382]  I mean, I want to have that type of mental illness attack me.
[01:29:35.382 --> 01:29:38.343]  They don't understand how the internet works or how metrics work.
[01:29:38.343 --> 01:29:42.084]  It's really helping the site, so I'm actually quite thankful for it.
[01:29:42.084 --> 01:29:43.824]  I hope it intensifies, actually.
[01:29:43.824 --> 01:29:47.965]  The traffic's really helping us with our click rates with our sponsors.
[01:29:47.965 --> 01:29:49.365]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.365 --> 01:29:51.905]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.905 --> 01:29:54.586]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.843 --> 01:30:04.710]  We now know why StemXpress is so desperate to censor the undercover Planned Parenthood video featuring its CEO.
[01:30:04.710 --> 01:30:16.524]  The law prohibits organ and tissue donors from selling for profit, yet solicitation materials from StemXpress repeatedly tout how financially profitable and rewarding and beneficial it can be to the fiscal growth for abortion clinics.
[01:30:16.704 --> 01:30:24.034]  And when asked what they can do to help clinics that aren't profiting, the CEO is astonished and says she doesn't know any who aren't profiting.
[01:30:24.034 --> 01:30:25.696]  You want to say this is about women's health?
[01:30:25.696 --> 01:30:31.945]  She talks about the contamination of samples with staff due to unsanitary clinic conditions being a repeated problem.
[01:30:32.225 --> 01:30:37.429]  And the Stem Express CEO talks about the stigma of delivering butchered baby parts to labs.
[01:30:37.429 --> 01:30:38.349]  How they freak out.
[01:30:38.349 --> 01:30:40.411]  How they have meltdowns when they get a whole head.
[01:30:40.411 --> 01:30:45.094]  How they'll request hands and feet to be removed from limbs so they don't have to confront what it is.
[01:30:45.094 --> 01:30:47.856]  But then she comments, but we know what it is.
[01:30:47.856 --> 01:30:52.440]  For that reason, she says, many are turning to adult stem cells or bone marrow.
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:55.602]  And she concludes... We're either in the cause or not.
[01:30:55.602 --> 01:30:57.583]  This is David Knight reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:30:58.784 --> 01:31:02.866]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[01:31:02.866 --> 01:31:13.330]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[01:31:13.330 --> 01:31:16.251]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[01:31:16.391 --> 01:31:25.539]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[01:31:25.539 --> 01:31:27.040]  This is the good halogen.
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:30.123]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.
[01:31:30.123 --> 01:31:42.134]  Now we at InfoWarsLife.com are bringing you the only source of clean, pure 99.99 Ultra Pure Deep Earth Crystals from more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:31:42.134 --> 01:31:43.395]  Watch the informational videos

[01:31:58.490 --> 01:32:08.600]  Most of the InfoWars radio listening audience is aware of the high quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at htfirearms.com.
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:14.746]  One of the most exciting things about htfirearms.com is the ability to upgrade your AR-15 platform today.
[01:32:14.746 --> 01:32:16.848]  They call it their low profile platform.

[01:33:02.592 --> 01:33:03.573]  Big Brother.
[01:33:03.573 --> 01:33:05.254]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:05.254 --> 01:33:06.635]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:06.635 --> 01:33:07.936]  You want answers?

[01:33:09.958 --> 01:33:12.901]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:20.713 --> 01:33:28.321]  Rob in Maine.
[01:33:28.321 --> 01:33:29.702]  Ben in Missouri.
[01:33:29.702 --> 01:33:31.724]  Robert, Missouri.
[01:33:31.724 --> 01:33:32.825]  Buckley in Missouri.
[01:33:32.825 --> 01:33:33.826]  Missouri, Missouri, Missouri.
[01:33:33.826 --> 01:33:37.689]  We're going to be going to all of you.
[01:33:37.689 --> 01:33:38.790]  800-259-9231 here in just a moment.
[01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:41.153]  But I've got to mention this news.
[01:33:41.153 --> 01:33:43.415]  You can probably find, I don't want to exaggerate,
[01:33:45.719 --> 01:34:02.598]  5,000 news articles, sort of like 3,000 in one week one time, because AP got republished everywhere, saying that there was no plan to use drones to surveil you, no plan to weaponize drones, even as it was being announced by law enforcement federally, state, and local.
[01:34:04.181 --> 01:34:06.001]  In the last five, six years.
[01:34:06.001 --> 01:34:09.782]  They would have articles going, Alex Jones and Infowars.com are liars.
[01:34:09.782 --> 01:34:15.424]  There is no plan to surveil you, no plan to surveil farmers and what they're planting or what they do with drones.
[01:34:15.424 --> 01:34:16.964]  No plan to weaponize them.
[01:34:16.964 --> 01:34:22.865]  Matt Drudge then ran the lying article of Infowars and put out the horrible disinformation.
[01:34:22.865 --> 01:34:25.926]  And that's because they didn't want to debate about it before they rolled it out.
[01:34:27.622 --> 01:34:29.785]  They've since had Houston crash drones.
[01:34:29.785 --> 01:34:32.750]  They've tested armed drones.
[01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:39.640]  And look, it makes perfect sense if you've got a suspect held up or whatever, and to not send cops in to get killed, to send in a drone.
[01:34:41.172 --> 01:34:54.880]  The problem is, then they'll get rid of humans altogether and have nothing but drones, and then that doesn't have human decision-making in it, and the globalists that have a technocracy, they can program and control, and that's why they're going there.
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:35:00.163]  When I flew to Canada, they gave us on the airplane the National Post on Canada Air.
[01:35:01.377 --> 01:35:17.107]  And that's the big national paper of Canada, obviously, and the cover story was, and I meant to bring it back but I left it on the plane, maybe you guys can pull it up, that the headline was, as roads go driverless, insurance companies may be a thing of the past.
[01:35:17.107 --> 01:35:22.391]  And the article's like, yeah, it's going to save you money and there's going to be, because of the insurance, there's still going to be insurance.
[01:35:23.527 --> 01:35:30.330]  They're just going to phase you out of your car, having it be higher, because you're quote, not as good a driver as the driverless car.
[01:35:30.330 --> 01:35:32.011]  They've said this a decade ago.
[01:35:32.011 --> 01:35:36.393]  And then there'll be a lower tax and fees and all the rest of it.
[01:35:36.393 --> 01:35:40.254]  It's the insurance companies owned by the big banks that are running this.
[01:35:40.254 --> 01:35:41.595]  So again, try to pull that up.
[01:35:41.595 --> 01:35:50.259]  Nationalpost.com, just say National Post in the search box, and then type in driverless vehicles will lower insurance rates.
[01:35:51.408 --> 01:35:53.089]  And that should pull it up.
[01:35:53.089 --> 01:35:54.670]  Or I can try.
[01:35:54.670 --> 01:35:58.053]  But the reason I get into that is, here's this new article.
[01:35:58.053 --> 01:36:05.037]  First state legalizes taser drones for cops, thanks to a lobbyist.
[01:36:05.037 --> 01:36:08.179]  North Dakota, the Daily Beast.
[01:36:08.179 --> 01:36:10.141]  So it's crowd control, folks.
[01:36:10.141 --> 01:36:11.882]  Here's one out of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:36:11.882 --> 01:36:13.303]  This will illustrate everything.
[01:36:13.303 --> 01:36:17.065]  Before a robot takes your job, you'll be working side by side.
[01:36:17.065 --> 01:36:17.646]  So cops,
[01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:22.844]  Before a robot or a drone takes your job, you'll be working side-by-side.
[01:36:22.844 --> 01:36:23.965]  Fighter pilots.
[01:36:23.965 --> 01:36:27.848]  Before a drone takes your job, you'll be working side-by-side.
[01:36:27.848 --> 01:36:33.854]  And again, people can say, well that's just the natural move of technology, and technology usually empowers, not enslaves.
[01:36:33.854 --> 01:36:42.182]  I agree with that, except now, under the technocracy, this is being done specifically.
[01:36:42.182 --> 01:36:43.543]  You guys found that National Post story?
[01:36:45.563 --> 01:36:47.684]  I get an obsession with this, I've got to find it.
[01:36:47.684 --> 01:36:49.345]  You guys are awesome, you usually find stuff so quick.
[01:36:49.345 --> 01:36:51.106]  Let me see if I can do it.
[01:36:51.106 --> 01:36:54.128]  Are you searching, where are you searching news?
[01:36:54.128 --> 01:36:57.010]  Alright, I would try to search news.
[01:36:57.010 --> 01:36:59.511]  Let me try to give you the exact headline.
[01:36:59.511 --> 01:37:01.833]  Sometimes it's different in the paper than online.
[01:37:01.833 --> 01:37:05.675]  And sometimes the stories that are in the paper aren't online.
[01:37:05.675 --> 01:37:10.138]  As roads go driverless, it's just a foregone conclusion.
[01:37:13.954 --> 01:37:17.717]  Insurance companies may be obsolete.
[01:37:17.717 --> 01:37:21.280]  National Post.
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:27.805]  Or just do driverless cars, National Post, Click News.
[01:37:27.805 --> 01:37:30.827]  Doesn't matter, I'm just putting it out for everybody else so they can find it as well.
[01:37:30.827 --> 01:37:32.148]  So, that's where this is going.
[01:37:32.148 --> 01:37:36.251]  This is being done to displace humanity.
[01:37:36.251 --> 01:37:39.854]  This is being done as a decision, as a planned architecture.
[01:37:39.854 --> 01:37:40.835]  Like you build a big building.
[01:37:42.598 --> 01:37:44.519]  It's being built in that we're obsolete.
[01:37:44.519 --> 01:37:45.600]  That's a crime.
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:48.102]  This gives incredible centralized control.
[01:37:48.102 --> 01:37:49.343]  That's why it's a problem.
[01:37:49.343 --> 01:37:52.805]  Of course there's arguments for all of it.
[01:37:52.805 --> 01:37:58.389]  But you notice they're trying to get laws passed to restrict citizens from having drones, where again only the system has it.
[01:37:58.389 --> 01:37:59.910]  So there's that as well.
[01:37:59.910 --> 01:38:01.691]  Let's go to Rob in Maine.
[01:38:01.691 --> 01:38:04.453]  Rob, you're on the air.
[01:38:04.453 --> 01:38:06.154]  Hi Alex.
[01:38:06.154 --> 01:38:07.695]  I want to make a couple of points here.
[01:38:09.096 --> 01:38:14.959]  This guy, the shooter, and the mind control drugs that have been used.
[01:38:14.959 --> 01:38:22.204]  But first, I'd like to say thank God for Larry Nichols and the Clinton Chronicles.
[01:38:22.204 --> 01:38:29.248]  As a public access TV producer, I have read that film three or four times over the years.
[01:38:29.248 --> 01:38:31.409]  I've done this for 12 years.
[01:38:31.409 --> 01:38:38.153]  And I'd like to say, Mr. and Mrs. America, you've got to see that film, the Clinton Chronicles.
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:44.024]  So I loved your rant on Hillary this morning or earlier.
[01:38:44.024 --> 01:38:45.044]  That was great.
[01:38:45.044 --> 01:38:50.848]  I can't stand seeing those people in the bushes coming back to these two dynasties.
[01:38:50.848 --> 01:38:53.030]  It just makes me sick.
[01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:57.773]  But this shooter definitely looks like a Manchurian candidate.
[01:38:57.773 --> 01:39:04.317]  All the hallmarks of it, you know, the way they worked in the race angle, as well as the, you know, the random shooting.
[01:39:04.317 --> 01:39:08.260]  And yes, she'll be on a psychotropic drug or something, but
[01:39:08.905 --> 01:39:11.466]  There is one point that has kind of been bothering me.
[01:39:11.466 --> 01:39:16.188]  The Suboxone, there was a picture of it earlier in one of the articles that you were showing.
[01:39:16.188 --> 01:39:17.369]  It's Suboxone.
[01:39:17.369 --> 01:39:21.671]  And that, I don't believe that is really in that class of drugs.
[01:39:21.671 --> 01:39:30.035]  I had to use that myself for a couple of years to get off of pills that I got hooked when I went to the dentist on Vicodin and stuff.
[01:39:30.035 --> 01:39:34.037]  And they use that to wean people off of opiates.
[01:39:36.047 --> 01:39:39.830]  So, it's like an opiate, but they tell you you can't get high on it.
[01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:44.173]  But it has an amnesic effect for a lot of people.
[01:39:44.173 --> 01:39:45.094]  I really couldn't say.
[01:39:45.094 --> 01:39:54.021]  That may be true, but I'm pretty sure it's not in the same class as these other things like the serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[01:39:54.021 --> 01:39:55.422]  No, it's not.
[01:39:55.422 --> 01:39:56.623]  So, yeah.
[01:39:56.623 --> 01:39:58.124]  It's more like an opiate itself.
[01:39:58.124 --> 01:40:03.348]  It's kind of like it replaced the old methadone.
[01:40:03.348 --> 01:40:04.009]  So, yeah.
[01:40:04.717 --> 01:40:06.178]  Uh, that was my point on that.
[01:40:06.178 --> 01:40:07.819]  Suboxone.
[01:40:07.819 --> 01:40:09.740]  I think there's a little confusion about that.
[01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:17.345]  But, yeah, this guy looks like a Manchurian candidate all the way, because, uh, I think 95% of these guys are.
[01:40:17.345 --> 01:40:20.447]  Well, we know that the shooter in Colorado was.
[01:40:20.447 --> 01:40:21.368]  We have all the proof.
[01:40:21.368 --> 01:40:24.290]  It's stunning they did it, just like Sirhan Sirhan.
[01:40:24.290 --> 01:40:25.411]  He told the jailers that.
[01:40:25.411 --> 01:40:27.672]  He told people in Solnex that I'm drugged.
[01:40:27.672 --> 01:40:29.173]  I'm part of a secret government program.
[01:40:29.173 --> 01:40:30.414]  I don't know what happened.
[01:40:30.414 --> 01:40:31.574]  Help me.
[01:40:31.574 --> 01:40:32.735]  And then the feds grabbed him.
[01:40:34.926 --> 01:40:37.447]  And then he was in a secret government program that came out.
[01:40:37.447 --> 01:40:39.448]  He was given almost $100,000 a year by the Feds.
[01:40:39.448 --> 01:40:41.949]  His dad was in a super secret program.
[01:40:41.949 --> 01:40:44.731]  He was under a top Air Force psychiatrist.
[01:40:44.731 --> 01:40:46.452]  They knew what was going to happen.
[01:40:46.452 --> 01:40:47.632]  He was totally set up.
[01:40:47.632 --> 01:40:49.073]  I don't think he was even the shooter.
[01:40:49.073 --> 01:40:49.893]  Thank you for the call.
[01:40:49.893 --> 01:40:50.874]  Great points.
[01:40:50.874 --> 01:40:54.736]  By the way, let me add one more chapter to this and I'm going back to your calls.
[01:40:54.736 --> 01:41:00.078]  Before a robot takes your job, you will be working side by side with one.
[01:41:00.078 --> 01:41:00.839]  Wall Street Journal.
[01:41:00.839 --> 01:41:03.360]  And it goes through the studies from Foster Research.
[01:41:06.676 --> 01:41:12.718]  Breaking all of this down in an Oxford paper and a bunch of other major studies.
[01:41:12.718 --> 01:41:15.139]  Well, here's Lancaster Online.
[01:41:15.139 --> 01:41:19.900]  Uber to work with U of A on mapping self-driving cars.
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:26.182]  Uber to work with them to basically phase out their own drivers.
[01:41:26.182 --> 01:41:29.503]  See, when Uber first came out a few years ago,
[01:41:31.511 --> 01:41:40.616]  I didn't think it through because I didn't know that Rahm Emanuel's brother Ezekiel Emanuel has a $100 million investment in it and has already made $2 billion.
[01:41:40.616 --> 01:41:42.857]  That hadn't happened yet.
[01:41:42.857 --> 01:41:46.780]  I didn't know that they were exempt from all the laws.
[01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:54.584]  But what they do, all over the world, in mainly liberal or socialist cities, with mayors, is they come in and give them massive money.
[01:41:54.584 --> 01:41:56.065]  They give money to the local political group.
[01:41:57.537 --> 01:42:04.401]  They keep all the regulations on the taxi drivers for multi-hundred-thousand-dollar-a-year medallions to be able to operate.
[01:42:04.401 --> 01:42:11.925]  All the regulations, all the controls, can only drive 10 hours a day, have to pay these huge fees when you go to the airport.
[01:42:11.925 --> 01:42:17.049]  But then Uber is allowed to bypass all of that.
[01:42:17.049 --> 01:42:19.550]  So see, it's not privatization.
[01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:20.711]  It's not competition.
[01:42:21.795 --> 01:42:26.377]  Even though I can't stand a lot of the cab drivers and how corrupt they are and the mafia connections there.
[01:42:26.377 --> 01:42:30.538]  But that's a smaller, older mafia generally.
[01:42:30.538 --> 01:42:46.884]  They are set there to not be able to make profits, to still pay all the taxes, and then insider groups that own Uber, they are allowed to do things that the other companies, like Uber, aren't allowed to either.
[01:42:46.884 --> 01:42:48.704]  They're the designated winner.
[01:42:48.704 --> 01:42:50.925]  They're the ones that get left alone everywhere but
[01:42:51.906 --> 01:42:56.070]  Paris, France, San Francisco, you name it.
[01:42:56.070 --> 01:43:15.889]  They come in, they're above the law, they don't have to pay the taxes, they don't have to pay the regulations, but then the cab drivers do, and then you hear from the owner, the CEO, the founder of Uber that, oh, we're going to have all the cars be Uber, we want a monopoly, and we're going to dominate Google, and we're going to have driverless cars.
[01:43:16.684 --> 01:43:18.086]  And then you understand what it's about.
[01:43:18.086 --> 01:43:34.264]  You find out governments are involved with them as the knighted, bespoke, touched, above the law group that is then going to be given the driverless car franchise.
[01:43:35.469 --> 01:43:39.131]  And there'll be a few other subsidiaries owned by the very same people.
[01:43:39.131 --> 01:43:43.193]  Then there's the war over your future driverless car service has begun.
[01:43:43.193 --> 01:43:49.817]  Uber's acquisition of 100 Microsoft mapping engineers puts Google in the crosshairs.
[01:43:49.817 --> 01:43:53.099]  You see, they want to be the new Google.
[01:43:53.099 --> 01:43:54.260]  They've said that.
[01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:58.922]  But it won't be a person opening the car door for you.
[01:43:58.922 --> 01:44:01.124]  And they're allowed to make super massive profits
[01:44:02.148 --> 01:44:10.713]  Because they are exempt from all the other rules that they themselves, their controllers, have put in place.
[01:44:10.713 --> 01:44:17.698]  And then no matter what you do, they stay above the law because billions are rolling in to the insiders.
[01:44:17.698 --> 01:44:20.780]  And then the Uber drivers themselves go out, buy a new car, do this.
[01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:21.820]  They can be dismissed.
[01:44:21.820 --> 01:44:26.923]  They'll say, oh, we found out three years ago you had a speeding ticket.
[01:44:26.923 --> 01:44:28.324]  You didn't tell us about that.
[01:44:30.043 --> 01:44:33.625]  Revoking for a year or for two years.
[01:44:33.625 --> 01:44:35.306]  Oh, and they don't have to pay taxes.
[01:44:35.306 --> 01:44:37.107]  They don't have to pay insurance.
[01:44:37.107 --> 01:44:41.870]  All their workers are contractors at Uber.
[01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:45.252]  And so again, the taxis have to be part of a union.
[01:44:45.252 --> 01:44:47.594]  They have to have all this bonding.
[01:44:47.594 --> 01:44:49.175]  They have to pay for everything.
[01:44:49.175 --> 01:44:50.235]  They have to be on the hook.
[01:44:50.235 --> 01:44:51.136]  They get written the tickets.
[01:44:52.196 --> 01:44:56.880]  But then when it comes to Uber, again, like Walmart, it's screwing everybody over.
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:45:00.123]  So, Uber may be a great alternative to taxis.
[01:45:00.123 --> 01:45:05.708]  It does bring some competition to taxis, but it's not level playing field, and it's very unfair.
[01:45:05.708 --> 01:45:14.515]  And Uber itself is a very draconian, anti-free market, monopolistic, fascistic company, in my humble view.
[01:45:14.515 --> 01:45:15.996]  Let's go to the phone calls.
[01:45:15.996 --> 01:45:17.638]  Ben in Missouri, you're on the air.
[01:45:19.122 --> 01:45:21.904]  Hey Alex, um, I agree with you completely about Uber.
[01:45:21.904 --> 01:45:40.679]  They'll, uh, incrementally, you know, they'll designate more and more roads to be, you know, driverless cars only, and then they'll give those areas the tax breaks, and they'll build up those areas until anybody who doesn't want to be on a driverless car system won't even be able to live and work
[01:45:41.608 --> 01:45:44.130]  They admit that's their plan.
[01:45:44.130 --> 01:45:45.110]  They admit that's their plan.
[01:45:45.110 --> 01:45:46.051]  That's what's so frustrating.
[01:45:46.051 --> 01:45:49.753]  People think I keep predicting stuff, you know, a decade or two before.
[01:45:49.753 --> 01:45:50.233]  I'm not.
[01:45:50.233 --> 01:45:52.494]  They have an admitted rollout plan.
[01:45:52.494 --> 01:46:02.240]  I mean, I remember 10 years ago or more reading that they would just raise insurance on driver cars, human cars, until we go bankrupt, just like coal power plants.
[01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:04.021]  And they're just going to do it.
[01:46:04.021 --> 01:46:09.824]  And then Uber and a few other companies like Google are going to have the monopoly or the oligopoly on it.
[01:46:09.824 --> 01:46:11.204]  It's highway robbery.
[01:46:11.204 --> 01:46:19.389]  And then it brings total control, centralization, everything's automated and run by the central computers, controlled by the technocracy.
[01:46:19.389 --> 01:46:25.972]  That's why the globalists at Club of Rome in the 60s and Zbigniew Brzezinski in the 70s, in the technotronic era,
[01:46:26.332 --> 01:46:32.075]  Say, we're going to build a world government run by a technocracy controlled by computers.
[01:46:32.075 --> 01:46:41.299]  Then they sell the idea through Zeitgeist and the rest of it, the New York Times endorses, that, oh, we're doing all this because it empowers humanity.
[01:46:41.299 --> 01:46:42.099]  No, it doesn't.
[01:46:42.099 --> 01:46:43.580]  And computers, they're
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:45.681]  They're not racist.
[01:46:45.681 --> 01:46:47.802]  Computers just do the right thing.
[01:46:47.802 --> 01:46:48.503]  No, they don't.
[01:46:48.503 --> 01:46:50.824]  They do as they're programmed.
[01:46:50.824 --> 01:46:57.649]  But see, in the new political correctness thing, the computers will make all the decisions so that there's no racism involved.
[01:46:57.649 --> 01:46:58.369]  You understand?
[01:46:58.369 --> 01:47:05.354]  And now they're saying it's racist against computers if you warn of the bad uses of technology.
[01:47:05.354 --> 01:47:06.114]  How do you like that?
[01:47:06.114 --> 01:47:11.397]  So there's going to be laws when they start claiming computers are sentient that you can't criticize them.
[01:47:11.397 --> 01:47:12.018]  How's that sound?
[01:47:13.717 --> 01:47:23.202]  Well, I certainly wouldn't want to be racist against the computer, and I certainly wouldn't think that any of the loving insurance companies would want to make anybody go broke.
[01:47:23.202 --> 01:47:27.065]  They've been so good for the country so far.
[01:47:27.065 --> 01:47:34.349]  As far as the shooting goes, I mean, there's not much that I can really say that hasn't already been covered here ad nauseum.
[01:47:34.349 --> 01:47:36.950]  I mean, it fits the narrative.
[01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:38.151]  It pushes the racial division.
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:42.702]  And they know now that Charleston has settled down.
[01:47:42.702 --> 01:47:47.063]  You know, maybe we can get all these people to turn in their guns if the shoe's on the other foot.
[01:47:47.063 --> 01:47:53.946]  Maybe we'll have this guy shoot a white person, and now you'll see the black on white violence.
[01:47:53.946 --> 01:47:56.927]  And maybe that'll get the white people to turn in their guns.
[01:47:56.927 --> 01:48:02.469]  And, you know, obviously, like I said, pushing the racial division, it completely fits the narrative.
[01:48:02.469 --> 01:48:06.191]  And in my opinion, something really stinks about this entire situation.
[01:48:06.929 --> 01:48:17.594]  I don't, I can't even really think of a mass shooting, quote-unquote, or a high-profile shooting like this that didn't seem like there was something more going on.
[01:48:17.594 --> 01:48:21.536]  Well, there's been some of them that we caught red-handed being staged.
[01:48:21.536 --> 01:48:27.719]  Sirhan Sirhan with RFK, the situation a few years ago with the Aurora shooting.
[01:48:27.719 --> 01:48:29.780]  I mean, those were staged.
[01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:31.061]  We caught them.
[01:48:31.061 --> 01:48:32.661]  We know exactly what they did.
[01:48:32.661 --> 01:48:33.382]  It's unbelievable.
[01:48:34.402 --> 01:48:37.803]  And then you look at Sandy Hook, it just isn't real.
[01:48:37.803 --> 01:48:43.185]  I don't know what specifically happened, but the official story is a fairy tale.
[01:48:43.185 --> 01:49:00.512]  I mean, Jack of the Beanstalk isn't real, Santa Claus isn't real, and that is a giant theater operation complete with blue screens, and now even Rob Dues' uncle, who's a Navy SEAL, retired FBI, works for a big company,
[01:49:01.633 --> 01:49:06.656]  We have a reporter up there and it's like, that's Rob Dues' uncle.
[01:49:06.656 --> 01:49:08.296]  And he's like, yeah, it doesn't add up.
[01:49:08.296 --> 01:49:08.717]  Something's going on.
[01:49:08.717 --> 01:49:10.157]  I've never seen anything like this.
[01:49:10.157 --> 01:49:11.038]  There's no paperwork.
[01:49:11.038 --> 01:49:12.238]  They're covering something up.
[01:49:12.238 --> 01:49:12.799]  I can't talk.
[01:49:12.799 --> 01:49:14.059]  I gotta get out of here.
[01:49:14.059 --> 01:49:25.385]  So, I mean, that's how Twilight Zone this has gotten that there's like Navy SEAL FBI agents looking into this and informers top school safety heads.
[01:49:27.253 --> 01:49:30.454]  Are investigating it and saying, this isn't real.
[01:49:30.454 --> 01:49:32.495]  This isn't real.
[01:49:32.495 --> 01:49:34.316]  This isn't real.
[01:49:34.316 --> 01:49:35.717]  I appreciate your call.
[01:49:35.717 --> 01:49:37.577]  And look, it shows how bold they are.
[01:49:37.577 --> 01:49:40.479]  Planned Parenthood said, we don't sell the body parts and make money.
[01:49:40.479 --> 01:49:43.380]  Now they've been caught making money on the new videos.
[01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:47.321]  A month or two ago, they said the videos weren't real.
[01:49:47.321 --> 01:49:50.823]  They finally found the headline, the coming age of self driverless cars.
[01:49:54.369 --> 01:49:58.197]  What will auto insurers do when there are no drivers left to insure?
[01:49:58.197 --> 01:50:02.467]  And see, it sells it like, oh, it's gonna stop wrecks, it's gonna stop...
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:18.687]  No, they're going to have a tax, and they're going to have a highway safety fund, and they're going to still have problems with the machines, and they're going to be busy in the next decade or two jacking up rates on people that are drivers.
[01:50:18.687 --> 01:50:22.729]  That's where the money's going to be, saying that the computers are safer.
[01:50:22.729 --> 01:50:27.151]  And we as consumers have to say, no, we're not going to be socially engineered.
[01:50:27.151 --> 01:50:28.872]  Good job finding that.
[01:50:28.872 --> 01:50:30.153]  Just a search tip.
[01:50:30.153 --> 01:50:32.234]  We finally thought, hey, put the date in
[01:50:33.689 --> 01:50:37.511]  And asked for the cover, and I believe that's how they found it.
[01:50:37.511 --> 01:50:39.512]  But we'll print that article and cover it more.
[01:50:39.512 --> 01:50:49.477]  When I return, Robert in Missouri, Buckley in Missouri, Doug in Minnesota, Joshua in California, and more.
[01:50:49.477 --> 01:50:55.881]  And then at the bottom of the next hour, we're going to have a special guest in studio who joins us from Toronto, Canada.
[01:50:55.881 --> 01:50:56.401]  Stay with us.
[01:50:58.695 --> 01:51:02.657]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:02.657 --> 01:51:05.719]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:05.719 --> 01:51:07.279]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:07.279 --> 01:51:10.521]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[01:53:29.014 --> 01:53:32.755]  The Electronic Frontier Foundation Privacy Report says it's AT&T.
[01:53:32.755 --> 01:53:38.997]  AT&T customers need to know this when calling the Alex Jones 24-7 listen line at 1-605-562-9000.

[01:53:48.759 --> 01:53:51.760]  For everyone else, bookmark Alex Jones listen line number today, 1-605-562-9000.
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:51.960]  That's 1-605-562-9000.
[01:54:02.961 --> 01:54:05.244]  She's Hillary Clinton in disguise.
[01:54:25.247 --> 01:54:27.989]  I didn't mean to go off into a rant about driverless cars.
[01:54:27.989 --> 01:54:34.214]  It just shows how those of us that love innovation, love competition, see something like Uber.
[01:54:34.214 --> 01:54:39.118]  And I didn't research Uber the last few years, I just said, hey, it comes quicker, they're nicer, I love it.
[01:54:39.118 --> 01:54:50.486]  And then I found out, oh my gosh, it's above the law, gets to do whatever it wants, and it's anti-driver.
[01:54:50.486 --> 01:54:53.949]  And they won't let the taxi companies out of the control they're under.
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:57.162]  That's how the New World Order operates.
[01:54:57.162 --> 01:54:58.944]  They're always exempt from everything.
[01:54:58.944 --> 01:55:00.986]  They're above the law.
[01:55:00.986 --> 01:55:02.688]  They get to do whatever they want.
[01:55:02.688 --> 01:55:04.850]  And then the globalists get the profits.
[01:55:04.850 --> 01:55:08.274]  And it's all about basically making humans obsolete.
[01:55:08.274 --> 01:55:10.016]  How about we make globalists obsolete?
[01:55:12.130 --> 01:55:17.891]  I've got huge financial news that I need to get to, politics news, all the things we're getting distracted from right now.
[01:55:17.891 --> 01:55:21.092]  But this shooting's important because it's about survival.
[01:55:21.092 --> 01:55:32.915]  If we don't expose the fact that this was racially motivated and all part of the race war hype coming out of the White House, we will be collectively blamed for this.
[01:55:32.915 --> 01:55:38.156]  And that's why I get so angry, is I am sick of being blamed for what somebody else does.
[01:55:38.156 --> 01:55:41.537]  If some white guy goes and kills nine black people, I didn't do it.
[01:55:43.021 --> 01:55:49.183]  And if some black guy goes and shoots two white people, black people didn't do that either.
[01:55:49.183 --> 01:55:58.707]  But the folks that are hyping it up collectively that when a black person kills a white person, or a black person kills a white person, vice versa, that it's the group's fault.
[01:56:00.216 --> 01:56:05.639]  Well yeah, I mean, if you're part of ISIS, and ISIS goes around killing people, you share responsibility.
[01:56:05.639 --> 01:56:13.183]  But if I'm part of a racial ethnic group, and someone in my quote group does something, they're their own person!
[01:56:13.183 --> 01:56:26.309]  And I know our audience gets that, but we have to explain this to all the leftist followers, who really mean well, but have bought into the guilt as children, that they've done something wrong.
[01:56:26.309 --> 01:56:29.631]  And separately, the minorities then get a chip on their shoulder, some of them,
[01:56:31.144 --> 01:56:36.970]  And their whole world is through those goggles, through that distortion, that everybody's out to get them.
[01:56:36.970 --> 01:56:40.873]  I mean, if you go work somewhere and you act like people are out to get you, you're going to have a big problem.
[01:56:40.873 --> 01:56:49.161]  If you just are optimistic, have a good attitude, nine times out of ten, even if you're working with a bunch of jerks, you'll end up being successful.
[01:56:49.161 --> 01:56:51.984]  And that's what it comes down to.
[01:56:51.984 --> 01:56:54.466]  I mean, I've run into plenty of racists in my life against white people.
[01:56:54.466 --> 01:56:55.227]  I just laugh about it.
[01:56:57.856 --> 01:57:00.718]  And I know a lot of quote minorities that are very successful.
[01:57:00.718 --> 01:57:04.000]  Everybody wants to hang around with them and stuff because they're just cool people.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.843]  They're not obsessed like the media wants them to be with a chip on their shoulder.
[01:57:08.843 --> 01:57:13.146]  Now, we're going to start the next hour and I'm going to go directly to Robert who's been holding everybody else.
[01:57:13.146 --> 01:57:21.212]  I briefly need to just remind you that Infowarslife.com has 30% off the colloidal silver at its already discounted price.
[01:57:21.212 --> 01:57:24.434]  Absolutely essential what it does for me and my family when I've been sick.
[01:57:25.336 --> 01:57:28.518]  Well, I've had a chest cold that antibiotics couldn't knock out.
[01:57:28.518 --> 01:57:30.139]  It knocked it out for me.
[01:57:30.139 --> 01:57:31.160]  Same thing for my dad.
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:34.382]  The same chest cold killed my uncle last year.
[01:57:34.382 --> 01:57:37.804]  And I don't recommend you drink as much of it as I do.
[01:57:37.804 --> 01:57:40.826]  Talk to your doctor first, but it's serious stuff.
[01:57:40.826 --> 01:57:45.209]  30% off one bottle, 50% off if you buy two bottles, get two free.
[01:57:45.209 --> 01:57:46.509]  Best deal out there.
[01:57:46.509 --> 01:57:51.673]  Super Male Vitality is the most concentrated, natural, purified, organic
[01:57:52.193 --> 01:58:01.315]  Herbs and compounds known to boost male and female vitality, super male and super female vitality are pretty similar formulas.
[01:58:01.315 --> 01:58:04.156]  I like the female vitality on me, it works even better.
[01:58:04.156 --> 01:58:10.978]  It's not because I'm like a woman, it's just the particular herbs that it has added supercharge things.
[01:58:10.978 --> 01:58:12.618]  You can read all the incredible reviews

[01:58:57.598 --> 01:59:05.705]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:59:06.005 --> 01:59:10.868]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:59:10.868 --> 01:59:17.673]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:17.673 --> 01:59:24.858]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:59:24.858 --> 01:59:31.703]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:59:31.863 --> 01:59:36.346]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:59:46.033 --> 01:59:51.136]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:51.136 --> 01:59:53.738]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:04.878 --> 02:00:06.800]  Let's go to Robert in Missouri.
[02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:09.702]  Thank you for holding like a trooper, sir.
[02:00:09.702 --> 02:00:10.463]  You're on the air.
[02:00:10.463 --> 02:00:11.283]  Go ahead.
[02:00:11.283 --> 02:00:17.108]  What do you think of this tragic shooting in Virginia, now the number one news story in the world?
[02:00:29.258 --> 02:00:30.459]  Two people dead.
[02:00:30.459 --> 02:00:31.781]  ISIS kills 300,000.
[02:00:31.781 --> 02:00:32.822]  Nobody cares.
[02:00:32.822 --> 02:00:36.966]  The media decides what to make the big story, though the footage is dramatic.
[02:00:36.966 --> 02:00:39.068]  They're now demonizing the Second Amendment.
[02:00:39.068 --> 02:00:40.209]  What do you expect to happen?
[02:00:40.209 --> 02:00:43.312]  What's your take?
[02:00:43.312 --> 02:00:45.534]  Let me cover a couple subjects with you, Alex.
[02:00:45.534 --> 02:00:48.497]  It's hard to get through with you, and so just give me a couple minutes.
[02:00:48.497 --> 02:00:49.658]  I'm going to cover a few things.
[02:00:49.658 --> 02:00:50.819]  First, that shooting.
[02:00:50.819 --> 02:00:51.961]  I watched the footage once.
[02:00:52.839 --> 02:00:57.087]  It looked like something between a 9mm and a 40 or a 45.
[02:00:57.087 --> 02:00:59.411]  The 110 pound woman, probably.
[02:00:59.411 --> 02:01:02.096]  He pops her three times and she can still run off.
[02:01:02.096 --> 02:01:05.182]  I'm questioning the validity of the footage, number one.
[02:01:05.757 --> 02:01:08.759]  Number two, Charleston.
[02:01:08.759 --> 02:01:22.630]  If everybody would go to incendiaryarchive.com, I did a show four days after Charleston with Kyle Hunt from Renegade Broadcasting, renegadetribune.com, and we deconstructed Charleston every way from Sunday.
[02:01:22.630 --> 02:01:30.736]  Hillary Clinton happened to be in town that day giving a campaign speech at the Trident Technical College.
[02:01:30.736 --> 02:01:33.318]  There was a photographer with her named David Goldman.
[02:01:33.778 --> 02:01:36.601]  Took all the photos of her at the Trident College.
[02:01:36.601 --> 02:01:38.202]  Guess where he was that night?
[02:01:38.202 --> 02:01:41.304]  He got all those nice prayer circle pictures.
[02:01:41.304 --> 02:01:44.087]  David Goldman got all that footage.
[02:01:44.087 --> 02:01:51.613]  Federal law enforcement training centers, active shooter drills in Charleston from the 15th to the 19th.
[02:01:51.613 --> 02:01:53.895]  The hit went down on the 17th.
[02:01:53.895 --> 02:02:02.422]  Mayor Riley of Charleston, which sits on the 33rd parallel by the way, Mayor Riley sits on the Mayors Against Gun Violence with
[02:02:03.226 --> 02:02:08.208]  Mayor Tom Menino of Boston, the Boston Hopes bombing, and guess who else?
[02:02:08.208 --> 02:02:09.528]  Michael Bloomberg.
[02:02:09.528 --> 02:02:13.550]  That guy's been in the mayorship of Charleston since the 70s.
[02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:20.352]  I got four pages worth of notes that deconstruct that as another Gladio-style false flag operation.
[02:02:20.352 --> 02:02:25.054]  The body of Senator Pinckney laying in that casket was a joke.
[02:02:25.054 --> 02:02:28.415]  It looked like a wax figure out of Madame Tussauds.
[02:02:28.915 --> 02:02:31.877]  And so Charleston, I think, was a false flag.
[02:02:31.877 --> 02:02:37.700]  You know, there's so much research out there on the internet on Charleston being a hoax.
[02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:45.005]  Now, I'm not saying anybody wasn't killed, but, you know, they'll kill 3,000 people in the World Trade Center.
[02:02:45.005 --> 02:02:46.566]  They'll kill nine people in a church.
[02:02:46.566 --> 02:02:47.806]  It's not a big deal to these people.
[02:02:47.806 --> 02:02:49.487]  They're a bunch of statinists.
[02:02:49.487 --> 02:02:56.952]  Well, clearly, though, if they're staged it, why would they mix the racial thing in unless they're trying to trigger whites to go out and start killing blacks?
[02:02:58.447 --> 02:03:05.353]  Well no, they were trying to stir up blacks because look at the war on the confederacy, the confederate symbol.
[02:03:05.353 --> 02:03:08.676]  I know the shooting in Charleston was, if it was staged.
[02:03:08.676 --> 02:03:11.478]  I mean I know he wanted to start a race war, he supposedly said.
[02:03:11.478 --> 02:03:20.206]  I'm talking about why would they have an anti-gun event like this and then make it basically have a narrative that makes Black Lives Matter look bad.
[02:03:22.256 --> 02:03:26.958]  Here's the thing Alex, that kid was wearing a thousand dollar ballistic vest.
[02:03:26.958 --> 02:03:31.240]  I did a show with Dr. Jim Fesser where we deconstructed Charleston.
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:37.122]  It looks very, very bad and there's a ton of research on YouTube and the internet about Charleston.
[02:03:37.122 --> 02:03:38.103]  Now let me move on to
[02:03:39.143 --> 02:03:40.864]  9-11 real quick.
[02:03:40.864 --> 02:03:44.645]  I've been hearing you say lately, the Saudis quarterback 9-11.
[02:03:44.645 --> 02:03:49.086]  Well, I've got a stack of books that say the Israelis quarterback 9-11.
[02:03:49.086 --> 02:03:55.929]  There's 50 times more evidence that the Israelis, who are joined at the hip with the Saudis, by the way.
[02:03:55.929 --> 02:04:00.050]  Wayne Madsen's book really kind of covers that, the sword and the star.
[02:04:00.050 --> 02:04:08.173]  But I've got books upon books about the Israelis, the same people that hit us on the Levan Affair, the USS Liberty, the sick Jonathan Pollard on us.
[02:04:08.673 --> 02:04:14.935]  They did 9-11, Victor Thorne, Christopher Bolin, Edward Hendry's books.
[02:04:14.935 --> 02:04:21.216]  I mean, if you read those books, any of those books from any of those authors, you're going to know that the Israelis hit us on 9-11.
[02:04:21.216 --> 02:04:23.417]  And then, ISIS.
[02:04:23.417 --> 02:04:25.797]  Greater Israel is the plan for ISIS.
[02:04:25.797 --> 02:04:31.159]  They're creating a fake Sunni caliphate to sit on top of the Greater Israel.
[02:04:31.159 --> 02:04:35.900]  And I would suggest people look at Moshe Dayan and, what's his name?
[02:04:37.661 --> 02:04:40.022]  All right, very interesting, Robert.
[02:04:40.022 --> 02:04:40.602]  Very interesting.
[02:04:40.602 --> 02:04:41.723]  I gotta go here.
[02:04:41.723 --> 02:04:43.504]  I appreciate your call.
[02:04:43.504 --> 02:04:57.630]  We have exposed Israel being involved with Turkey and NATO and others with ISIS, but Saudi Arabia is involved as well, so the whole crowd that hates Israel always says that only Israel's running stuff and never anybody else.
[02:04:57.630 --> 02:04:58.190]  That's my problem.
[02:04:58.730 --> 02:05:06.713]  Comedian Bill Burr recently shattered the left-right paradigm of Conan O'Brien's audience and left them sitting in a stunned silence.
[02:05:06.713 --> 02:05:08.513]  I mean, I don't think it matters who's president.
[02:05:08.513 --> 02:05:09.894]  I'm one of those people.
[02:05:09.894 --> 02:05:10.974]  I don't think it matters.
[02:05:10.974 --> 02:05:11.454]  It doesn't.
[02:05:11.454 --> 02:05:12.755]  It doesn't.
[02:05:12.755 --> 02:05:13.575]  It doesn't matter at all.
[02:05:13.575 --> 02:05:15.556]  Dude, Hillary Clinton goes to those Bilderberg meetings.
[02:05:17.125 --> 02:05:18.686]  It's like the Illuminati stuff, right?
[02:05:18.686 --> 02:05:27.129]  She probably hooked up with some guy wearing like a goat's head and then she goes out on TV and she's talking to people who drive snowplows like she can relate to them.
[02:05:27.129 --> 02:05:30.811]  Burr also praised Trump for his political incorrectness.
[02:05:30.811 --> 02:05:39.314]  And regardless of what you think about Trump as a presidential contender, I think you very much should pay attention to what he said about how he's gained the system in the past.
[02:05:39.634 --> 02:05:42.136]  Before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman.
[02:05:42.136 --> 02:05:43.137]  I give to everybody.
[02:05:43.137 --> 02:05:44.519]  When they call, I give.
[02:05:44.519 --> 02:05:45.400]  And you know what?
[02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:49.904]  When I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them.
[02:05:49.904 --> 02:05:51.525]  They are there for me.
[02:05:51.525 --> 02:05:53.347]  And that's a broken system.
[02:05:53.347 --> 02:05:56.750]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com

[02:06:58.053 --> 02:07:02.155]  Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for InfoWars listeners.
[02:07:02.155 --> 02:07:12.601]  We've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting to resupply Survival Shield X2 Deep Earth Crystals that elite corporations are buying up the supplies all over the world.
[02:07:12.601 --> 02:07:15.523]  So prices are going up and it's very hard to secure it.
[02:07:15.643 --> 02:07:24.830]  We have been able to secure a limited supply of the Pure Deep Earth Crystals and have now been able to produce more Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[02:07:24.830 --> 02:07:26.331]  This is the good halogen.
[02:07:26.331 --> 02:07:29.394]  This is the opposite of the bad halogens like fluoride.

[02:08:10.805 --> 02:08:11.866]  How about Prozac?
[02:08:11.866 --> 02:08:14.147]  You know the number one... Oh, that's a big sponsor, isn't it?
[02:08:14.147 --> 02:08:15.167]  Or that whole class of drugs.
[02:08:15.167 --> 02:08:15.927]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:08:15.927 --> 02:08:17.928]  Oh, whoa, gotta cut that off, don't you?
[02:08:17.928 --> 02:08:19.589]  Don't want to talk about the U.S.
[02:08:19.589 --> 02:08:25.292]  number one cause of death is suicide now because they give people suicide mass murder pills.
[02:08:25.292 --> 02:08:25.672]  Calm down.
[02:08:25.672 --> 02:08:30.895]  Your answer is give more money to the psychiatrists and psychologists to put more crazy people on drugs that make them kill people, Pierce.
[02:08:30.895 --> 02:08:32.495]  Let's try and have a debate here.
[02:08:32.495 --> 02:08:32.976]  Yeah.
[02:08:32.976 --> 02:08:33.956]  Answer me this question.
[02:08:33.956 --> 02:08:35.677]  I'm sick of the same old script here, bud.
[02:08:35.677 --> 02:08:36.517]  It's fine, bud.
[02:08:43.214 --> 02:08:47.157]  Don't tread on me!
[02:08:47.157 --> 02:08:48.338]  Don't tread on me!
[02:08:48.338 --> 02:08:48.658]  So be it!
[02:08:48.658 --> 02:08:53.602]  Fret no more!
[02:08:53.602 --> 02:08:57.245]  To secure the pieces!
[02:08:57.245 --> 02:09:02.028]  To prepare for war!
[02:09:02.028 --> 02:09:03.149]  So be it!
[02:09:03.149 --> 02:09:05.691]  Settle the score!
[02:09:08.257 --> 02:09:12.420]  The globalists are preparing for war with the patriots of America.
[02:09:12.420 --> 02:09:16.284]  The hard-working veterans of every race, color, and creed.
[02:09:16.284 --> 02:09:21.027]  The patriots, the people that want to keep taxes low, the people that want government to not be corrupt.
[02:09:21.027 --> 02:09:24.710]  People that don't want foreign corporations and special interests running our nation.
[02:09:24.710 --> 02:09:29.574]  Armored vehicles, paramilitaries, FEMA camps, re-education centers.
[02:09:29.574 --> 02:09:32.496]  They even use those terms in official army manuals.
[02:09:33.337 --> 02:09:38.279]  Just type in Army Manual admits re-education camps in U.S.
[02:09:38.279 --> 02:09:40.620]  It's declassified.
[02:09:40.620 --> 02:09:43.901]  The babies being sold is public.
[02:09:43.901 --> 02:09:47.463]  The cancer viruses in the vaccine is public.
[02:09:47.463 --> 02:09:51.264]  They admit 100 plus million people got cancer from the polio vaccine.
[02:09:51.264 --> 02:09:52.105]  Just type that in.
[02:09:52.105 --> 02:09:54.826]  You'll read CDC documents from the 80s.
[02:09:54.826 --> 02:10:02.169]  100 million people got cancer.
[02:10:02.169 --> 02:10:02.809]  It isn't a game.
[02:10:05.555 --> 02:10:07.857]  It isn't a joke!
[02:10:07.857 --> 02:10:11.359]  These people mean business!
[02:10:11.359 --> 02:10:15.222]  And you ask, why do they then hate the military if the military has empowered this new world order?
[02:10:15.222 --> 02:10:17.984]  Because the age of man's over.
[02:10:17.984 --> 02:10:19.765]  The new technocracy's here.
[02:10:19.765 --> 02:10:21.306]  We're being phased out.
[02:10:21.306 --> 02:10:23.708]  The elite don't need us anymore, in their view.
[02:10:23.708 --> 02:10:24.328]  Well, guess what?
[02:10:24.328 --> 02:10:29.772]  We need us, and we don't want to die fighting with each other over what color we are.
[02:10:29.772 --> 02:10:31.954]  We want to unify and build a better world.
[02:10:31.954 --> 02:10:34.856]  Doesn't mean we're perfect, but we got goodwill for humanity.
[02:10:36.533 --> 02:10:53.964]  And another sour, mentally ill, probably narcissistic, big baby, just like the roof guy, has gone in on video and shot two white people dramatically.
[02:10:53.964 --> 02:10:55.645]  And yes, of course it could be staged.
[02:10:55.645 --> 02:10:57.166]  The Globalist staged all sorts of stuff.
[02:10:59.577 --> 02:11:00.778]  I don't know.
[02:11:00.778 --> 02:11:07.585]  All I know is they're coming after the guns, blaming us all collectively for the Second Amendment, and it's a load of baloney.
[02:11:07.585 --> 02:11:17.655]  And we need to explain and push back that gun crime is down, despite the fact that other crime is going up, because guns are scaring violent criminals.
[02:11:20.484 --> 02:11:23.867]  And all hell's starting to break loose as the economy melts down.
[02:11:23.867 --> 02:11:25.948]  We need our guns now more than ever.
[02:11:25.948 --> 02:11:36.275]  And the globalists know full well if they actually try to implement all these executive actions that are clearly unconstitutional, nakedly tyrannical by Obama, it's going to start an event.
[02:11:36.275 --> 02:11:38.597]  And that's why they're pushing us and baiting us.
[02:11:38.597 --> 02:11:49.225]  And that's why I've said and been called a traitor by some of the infiltrated militia groups that I believe if gun confiscation starts,
[02:11:52.111 --> 02:11:59.224]  At first, at least, we need to not get in firefights with the idiots that come to take the guns.
[02:11:59.224 --> 02:12:01.087]  Because they want to start a civil war.
[02:12:03.522 --> 02:12:29.857]  If we can control ourselves and not get in a civil war when they come to take the guns, which they're already doing to veterans and others, it'll be such a political backlash that things will change, state governments will line up and say no, then the feds will have to invade, and then we'll have governmental legitimacy and leaders like 1776 in front of us if they really want to have a civil war to win it and then to reconstitute the republic.
[02:12:29.857 --> 02:12:31.278]  The plan is to bring down the country.
[02:12:32.321 --> 02:12:45.367]  I'm going to say this, before you shoot your mouth off about killing cops and military that come and take the guns, you ought to be thinking about ways to hit them with information now so they have a debate first and won't take part in it.
[02:12:45.367 --> 02:12:47.748]  And believe me, they're already having that debate.
[02:12:47.748 --> 02:12:59.833]  But it's easy to sit around and talk about civil war all day and we're going to shoot anybody that does this or that, and the folks that talk about that all day, they're going to be hiding or they're working for the other side when this thing kicks off.
[02:13:01.044 --> 02:13:04.947]  I'll say this, I'm not going to any re-education camp, and neither is my family.
[02:13:04.947 --> 02:13:06.268]  And that's all I gotta say, folks.
[02:13:06.268 --> 02:13:08.709]  I'm not gonna sit here and shoot my mouth off.
[02:13:08.709 --> 02:13:16.935]  To prepare for peace, and to secure peace, you must prepare for war.
[02:13:16.935 --> 02:13:19.156]  And everything we do is an info war.
[02:13:19.156 --> 02:13:20.777]  That's my role.
[02:13:20.777 --> 02:13:25.861]  And yes, people have listened, and folks have spoken out, and the public is armed to the teeth.
[02:13:29.028 --> 02:13:31.169]  And I just want to say this again.
[02:13:31.169 --> 02:13:37.713]  If they start persecuting us and physically trying to drag folks off, just remember who's really responsible.
[02:13:37.713 --> 02:13:40.774]  It's the big bank heads, the big foundation heads.
[02:13:40.774 --> 02:13:41.535]  They're the enemy.
[02:13:41.535 --> 02:13:42.936]  They run it all.
[02:13:42.936 --> 02:13:45.777]  They're the ones that did it.
[02:13:45.777 --> 02:13:46.918]  You will not hurt them.
[02:13:50.427 --> 02:13:51.247]  Killing their minions.
[02:13:51.247 --> 02:13:52.788]  They want to destroy the U.S.
[02:13:52.788 --> 02:13:55.329]  military and police in the first wave.
[02:13:55.329 --> 02:14:08.895]  Normally in a war you'd want to degrade their forces and you may have to just to survive and to make them go into an armored type situation where they hunker down.
[02:14:08.895 --> 02:14:14.078]  But what will really make the new world order stop is if their own people at the top get in trouble.
[02:14:14.078 --> 02:14:14.918]  I don't mean Obama.
[02:14:14.918 --> 02:14:16.919]  Don't turn him into some type of martyr.
[02:14:18.237 --> 02:14:25.621]  But if they launch all this stuff, the people running the show, the actual bureaucrats, the actual corporate heads, they're the enemy.
[02:14:25.621 --> 02:14:40.029]  And what scares me more than anything, what concerns me more than anything, so I wouldn't really call it even fear, what makes me brace, is the actual head people are resigning and leaving the last three, four years and moving out and hiding out and changing their names.
[02:14:40.029 --> 02:14:41.610]  Because they know that.
[02:14:41.610 --> 02:14:44.092]  They know we're coming for them if they actually pull all this.
[02:14:45.169 --> 02:14:55.113]  And it's not something because I want to come for people or I want any of this to happen, but you hurt us, you put our people in camps, you kill us!
[02:14:55.113 --> 02:14:58.375]  I'll quote Iron Maiden, you fire musket, but I'm going to run you through.
[02:14:58.375 --> 02:15:00.736]  And I don't need guns to get that done.
[02:15:00.736 --> 02:15:03.697]  And I'm not talking about me individually.
[02:15:03.697 --> 02:15:07.559]  This spirit is going to tear you into pieces once you start a fight with it.
[02:15:11.141 --> 02:15:12.242]  And they know that, actually.
[02:15:12.242 --> 02:15:23.851]  They want to kill freedom so bad, they're willing to actually go up against the most vicious armed people the world's ever seen!
[02:15:23.851 --> 02:15:26.153]  Because they're evil.
[02:15:26.153 --> 02:15:27.574]  Let's go to Buckley in Missouri.
[02:15:27.574 --> 02:15:28.434]  Buckley, welcome.
[02:15:28.434 --> 02:15:31.016]  Thank you for holding her on the air.
[02:15:31.016 --> 02:15:32.277]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[02:15:32.277 --> 02:15:38.282]  Apparently, I must not be the only Prison Planet subscriber or regular listener to the show, because I've tried for two years to get through
[02:15:38.962 --> 02:15:41.143]  Well, you're here, and thank you for putting up with me.
[02:15:41.143 --> 02:15:41.463]  Go ahead.
[02:15:41.463 --> 02:15:46.805]  Yeah, earlier you just mentioned the term controlled globalist media.
[02:15:46.805 --> 02:15:48.006]  Perfect.
[02:15:48.006 --> 02:15:51.287]  Dinosaur media, you mentioned that a few minutes ago.
[02:15:51.287 --> 02:15:57.990]  But a couple weeks ago, and I'm giving you credit for coining this term, you said weaponized media.
[02:15:57.990 --> 02:15:59.310]  That's my favorite.
[02:15:59.310 --> 02:16:00.711]  That's perfect.
[02:16:00.711 --> 02:16:01.952]  It is weaponized media.
[02:16:01.952 --> 02:16:04.833]  I mean, they are sworn enemies of the people.
[02:16:05.660 --> 02:16:10.827]  I mean, the folks running this want to kill us.
[02:16:10.827 --> 02:16:20.799]  And you were right earlier when you said the weaponized media could, if they could get away with it, they would never report that this shooter was on pharmaceutical lobotomy drugs.
[02:16:20.799 --> 02:16:21.180]  That's right.
[02:16:22.407 --> 02:16:25.969]  I was born February 10th, the day before you were, plus 20 years.
[02:16:25.969 --> 02:16:28.450]  So I've got 20 years and a day on you.
[02:16:28.450 --> 02:16:31.131]  I know that you choose your own bumper music.
[02:16:31.131 --> 02:16:32.691]  I've heard you say that before.
[02:16:32.691 --> 02:16:40.815]  But I'd like to quote, if you have time, the lyrics of a song written and published by the late, great Francis Vincent Zappa in 1973.
[02:16:40.815 --> 02:16:43.576]  Oh, I love Frank Zappa.
[02:16:43.576 --> 02:16:44.797]  Boy, was he ahead of his time.
[02:16:44.797 --> 02:16:45.137]  Go ahead.
[02:16:46.109 --> 02:16:48.651]  He was, he was.
[02:16:48.651 --> 02:16:53.133]  The song published on, it was on the Overnight Sensation album 1973.
[02:16:53.133 --> 02:16:56.415]  The title of the song is I Am The Slime.
[02:16:56.415 --> 02:16:57.876]  Here's how it goes.
[02:16:57.876 --> 02:16:59.397]  I am gross and perverted.
[02:16:59.397 --> 02:17:00.938]  I'm obsessed and deranged.
[02:17:00.938 --> 02:17:03.580]  I have existed for years, but very little has changed.
[02:17:04.241 --> 02:17:10.448]  I'm the tool of the government and industry, too, for I am destined to rule and regulate you.
[02:17:10.448 --> 02:17:13.472]  I may be vile and pernicious, but you can't look away.
[02:17:13.472 --> 02:17:16.695]  I make you think I'm delicious with the stuff that I say.
[02:17:16.695 --> 02:17:18.237]  I'm the best you can get.
[02:17:18.237 --> 02:17:19.819]  Have you guessed me yet?
[02:17:19.819 --> 02:17:22.642]  I'm the slime oozing out from your TV set.
[02:17:23.405 --> 02:17:25.327]  You will obey me while I lead you.
[02:17:25.327 --> 02:17:27.249]  Eat the garbage that I feed you.
[02:17:27.249 --> 02:17:28.810]  Until the day that we don't need you.
[02:17:28.810 --> 02:17:29.731]  Don't go for help.
[02:17:29.731 --> 02:17:31.092]  No one will heed you.
[02:17:31.092 --> 02:17:33.094]  Your mind is totally controlled.
[02:17:33.094 --> 02:17:35.236]  It has been stuffed into my mold.
[02:17:35.236 --> 02:17:39.279]  And you will do as you were told until the rights to you are sold.
[02:17:39.279 --> 02:17:40.060]  That's right, folks.
[02:17:40.060 --> 02:17:40.941]  Don't touch that dot.
[02:17:41.678 --> 02:17:47.341]  Well, I am the son from the video, who's doing a long on the living room floor.
[02:17:47.341 --> 02:17:55.945]  You know what, I love that song, and my problem is, I do choose like 98% of the bumper music, and then so many times I write down songs I want to play.
[02:17:55.945 --> 02:18:05.169]  I've had Frank Zappa's Why Fine, I think I had Dweezil on too, yeah, they're listeners, his son, and I wanted to play that then and just never got around to it.
[02:18:05.169 --> 02:18:06.670]  What's the name of that song again?
[02:18:08.127 --> 02:18:09.147]  Uh, I Am The Slime.
[02:18:09.147 --> 02:18:11.308]  It was on the Overnight Sensation album 1973.
[02:18:11.308 --> 02:18:13.848]  We're gonna get the I Am The Slime.
[02:18:13.848 --> 02:18:16.809]  Try to play that at the bottom of the hour for you, if we're able to do it.
[02:18:16.809 --> 02:18:19.069]  With that particular, uh, lyrics piece.
[02:18:19.069 --> 02:18:20.749]  Yeah, his dad was a chemical engineer.
[02:18:20.749 --> 02:18:23.610]  He was super smart in his own right.
[02:18:23.610 --> 02:18:26.911]  Way ahead of his time, transcending the left-right paradigm.
[02:18:26.911 --> 02:18:29.251]  And, uh, you know, died of cancer very, very young.
[02:18:29.251 --> 02:18:32.572]  They say the good die young.
[02:18:32.572 --> 02:18:33.972]  Bob Marley died of cancer young.
[02:18:36.286 --> 02:18:37.267]  And it's just a real bummer.
[02:18:37.267 --> 02:18:37.867]  You gotta wonder.
[02:18:37.867 --> 02:18:39.088]  I mean, we know they killed John Lennon.
[02:18:39.088 --> 02:18:41.409]  I mean, I know for a fact.
[02:18:41.409 --> 02:18:45.511]  But the stuff I was told... And then this is Eye on the Slime.
[02:18:45.511 --> 02:18:47.312]  We're gonna come back to the lyrics later.
[02:18:47.312 --> 02:18:53.636]  The things I've been told about John Lennon, what happened to him, I'm not allowed to tell anybody.
[02:18:53.636 --> 02:18:59.639]  And that's part of being a journalist, is you get told really dangerous, really scary stuff.
[02:18:59.639 --> 02:19:01.060]  And then you're not allowed to talk about it.
[02:19:02.734 --> 02:19:18.159]  And I, you know, I don't blame people that know all this for not speaking out, though, because, you know, when the government sits in your living room and tells you if you talk about it, they're going to kill you, and they've already killed people close to you, you have a tendency to listen to them.
[02:19:19.090 --> 02:19:23.292]  You wonder why so many wives of people like Gary Webb that was shot twice in the head, he was killed.
[02:19:23.292 --> 02:19:25.112]  He told people, they're after me, they're following me.
[02:19:25.112 --> 02:19:26.133]  He had his book coming out.
[02:19:26.133 --> 02:19:26.893]  I was talking to him.
[02:19:26.893 --> 02:19:27.613]  He was vindicated.
[02:19:27.613 --> 02:19:29.934]  And they said, you're not going to vindicate Jack Crapper.
[02:19:29.934 --> 02:19:35.936]  We're going to come to your house and have you write out a deal that, you know, a suicide note or we're going to kill your family.
[02:19:35.936 --> 02:19:37.357]  Then they go to your wife and threaten her.
[02:19:37.357 --> 02:19:41.218]  You know, that's the thing that happened with Michael Hastings.
[02:19:41.218 --> 02:19:43.979]  You know, his wife, Biggs, was at the funeral.
[02:19:43.979 --> 02:19:45.000]  She said, oh, go after him.
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:45.400]  They killed him.
[02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:45.840]  It was horrible.
[02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:47.541]  A little bit later, she went on Piers Morgan and said,
[02:19:48.783 --> 02:19:51.408]  You know, no, it was all a big accident.
[02:19:51.408 --> 02:19:57.501]  So if they car bomb me and my family starts saying it was an accident, no it's not.
[02:19:57.501 --> 02:19:58.042]  We'll be right back.

[02:20:58.769 --> 02:21:08.077]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:21:08.077 --> 02:21:08.857]  This capitalism?
[02:21:08.857 --> 02:21:15.042]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:21:15.042 --> 02:21:18.725]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[02:21:28.453 --> 02:21:34.534]  So I say to Mark at lunch, look, you know, I keep hearing from the government that, you know, they're worried someday ISIS may get here.
[02:21:34.534 --> 02:21:40.375]  Then I go, duh, Garland, Texas, Mohammed cartoon shooting, ISIS is already here.
[02:21:40.375 --> 02:21:42.536]  I'm not waiting for these people to defend me.
[02:21:42.536 --> 02:21:46.937]  If they don't know ISIS is here already, they got no clue, I'm taking care of myself.

[02:22:18.821 --> 02:22:26.886]  The term best of all worlds has been belabored to death, and yet I've just discovered a whey protein powder that truly deserves to be called best of all worlds.

[02:24:27.238 --> 02:24:34.382]  ABC News, CNN, they're all reporting the gunman has now died after a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
[02:24:34.382 --> 02:24:37.804]  We're going to be going over all of that.
[02:24:37.804 --> 02:24:40.405]  We're going to continue with your phone calls.
[02:24:40.405 --> 02:24:47.969]  We have a special guest who's down here visiting from Canada, who has a lot of commentary on the controlled leftist paradigm and feminism.
[02:24:47.969 --> 02:24:52.271]  She'll be popping in studio with us as well.
[02:24:52.271 --> 02:24:56.253]  I want to go to as many of your phone calls as I can before the broadcast ends.
[02:25:00.455 --> 02:25:04.739]  Like, Bill in Tennessee, I love people that disagree with me.
[02:25:04.739 --> 02:25:09.504]  He says, Alex Jones predictions not happening.
[02:25:09.504 --> 02:25:11.106]  He's a WBCR listener.
[02:25:11.106 --> 02:25:16.891]  I may have to go to him in overdrive because there's other folks that have been holding longer, but we'll see what happens.
[02:25:16.891 --> 02:25:21.456]  And I love how most of what we've said has come true, unfortunately.
[02:25:24.298 --> 02:25:26.180]  We've been able to hold back some stuff.
[02:25:26.180 --> 02:25:36.168]  You know, like, they're going to register all your guns and then try to ban semi-autos and their bills fail by like two or three votes and people go, who wants my guns?
[02:25:36.168 --> 02:25:37.569]  The prediction didn't come true.
[02:25:37.569 --> 02:25:45.455]  Or, you know, this bubble could go any minute and then it doesn't go and then it's a year later it starts to go.
[02:25:45.455 --> 02:25:51.560]  I mean, the CBO is in the news today, Congressional Budget Office, saying that it's unsustainable debt
[02:25:55.606 --> 02:25:59.088]  That's in the Chicago Tribune.
[02:25:59.088 --> 02:26:00.069]  That's all we're saying.
[02:26:00.069 --> 02:26:04.652]  I mean, I don't know when the time bomb's going to go off, but it's crazy.
[02:26:04.652 --> 02:26:13.058]  There's hundreds of times the global debt with derivatives that we actually have money.
[02:26:13.058 --> 02:26:14.299]  People say, oh really?
[02:26:14.299 --> 02:26:16.020]  You know, fear mongering.
[02:26:16.020 --> 02:26:19.823]  So I want to go to him just to find out what the predictions are that didn't come true.
[02:26:23.049 --> 02:26:28.651]  You know, people call predictions what I'm saying I believe is coming if we don't stop it.
[02:26:28.651 --> 02:26:33.152]  And then we're here trying to put the fire out, and they're going, I thought you said it would burn the house down.
[02:26:33.152 --> 02:26:34.853]  Only part of the house is burned.
[02:26:34.853 --> 02:26:36.254]  We've got fire hoses trying to put out.
[02:26:36.254 --> 02:26:38.474]  We're like, we know, we know.
[02:26:38.474 --> 02:26:43.176]  We're saying if we don't stop all this, I mean, I told you they'd weaponize drones.
[02:26:43.176 --> 02:26:46.637]  It's in the news today.
[02:26:46.637 --> 02:26:50.278]  I told you they'd try to pass laws banning GMO labeling.
[02:26:50.278 --> 02:26:51.839]  Look, I know their agenda.
[02:26:54.252 --> 02:26:55.975]  I know what their plan is.
[02:26:55.975 --> 02:26:56.937]  I'm not perfect.
[02:26:56.937 --> 02:26:58.319]  I'm trying to stop it.
[02:26:58.319 --> 02:27:00.844]  I'm trying to get you involved and take action.
[02:27:00.844 --> 02:27:02.386]  So I can't wait till we talk to that caller.
[02:27:02.386 --> 02:27:04.630]  I want to go to Doug and others here in a moment.
[02:27:04.630 --> 02:27:06.754]  Briefly, I've not been talking enough lately.
[02:27:07.876 --> 02:27:10.858]  About survival shield nascent iodine x2.
[02:27:10.858 --> 02:27:12.600]  There's no other iodine like it.
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:13.981]  It's absolutely pure.
[02:27:13.981 --> 02:27:18.925]  It comes from a deep earth sourced, not stuff that has to be processed out of seaweed.
[02:27:18.925 --> 02:27:23.989]  It is in pure form and it just goes through grabbing bad halogens in your body and dragging them out.
[02:27:23.989 --> 02:27:29.153]  It blocks it in some of the glands like the thyroid to the bad halogens like fluoride and chlorine.
[02:27:30.233 --> 02:27:32.335]  That is just filling our environment.
[02:27:32.335 --> 02:27:33.937]  Can't get into it.
[02:27:33.937 --> 02:27:36.100]  And massive energy increases.
[02:27:36.100 --> 02:27:37.962]  Massive libido increases.
[02:27:37.962 --> 02:27:40.064]  My skin is so much healthier.
[02:27:40.064 --> 02:27:41.445]  It really is amazing.
[02:27:41.445 --> 02:27:44.829]  But it can have some serious effects if your thyroid's already in trouble and stuff.
[02:27:44.829 --> 02:27:48.874]  You need to talk to a physician before you do this or before you take larger dosages of it.
[02:27:48.874 --> 02:27:50.415]  If you don't have iodine, you'll die.
[02:27:51.246 --> 02:27:55.328]  And most of it's contaminated or not pure and can't be absorbed.
[02:27:55.328 --> 02:27:59.310]  Nascent supposedly can be absorbed, but most nascent we found is not really nascent.
[02:27:59.310 --> 02:28:02.952]  This is what I call true nascent iodine.
[02:28:02.952 --> 02:28:07.234]  Infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com
[02:28:10.623 --> 02:28:13.244]  And it really is essential that you try it.
[02:28:13.244 --> 02:28:15.265]  Bottom line, you're helping the broadcast.
[02:28:15.265 --> 02:28:16.466]  You're fighting the operation.
[02:28:16.466 --> 02:28:18.747]  But you can read the Ray Reviews.
[02:28:18.747 --> 02:28:21.288]  It has a 4.9 review.
[02:28:21.288 --> 02:28:23.389]  The overall products have a 4.8.
[02:28:23.389 --> 02:28:25.971]  Thousands of them.
[02:28:25.971 --> 02:28:26.891]  Look, the first review is 4.8.
[02:28:29.993 --> 02:28:32.474]  840 reviews of the nascent iodine alone.
[02:28:32.474 --> 02:28:37.038]  Thousands and thousands on the site itself by a major third-party site.
[02:28:37.038 --> 02:28:40.080]  Power Reviews, one of the most respected out there.
[02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:42.662]  Texas Steve-O in Austin, Texas.
[02:28:42.662 --> 02:28:45.604]  I bought five of the old survival shields at M4 Wars first sold.
[02:28:46.184 --> 02:28:55.247]  And I have to say, the first bottles were good, but over time, the color and taste faded, and the others, the six months, were older.
[02:28:55.247 --> 02:28:57.908]  The new X2s are way, way better.
[02:28:57.908 --> 02:29:00.048]  You can sure tell it's full of iodine.
[02:29:00.048 --> 02:29:02.209]  Tastes much stronger so far.
[02:29:02.209 --> 02:29:03.789]  Has not faded a bit.
[02:29:03.789 --> 02:29:06.790]  So, I talk about half of what AJ recommends.
[02:29:06.790 --> 02:29:09.291]  I also recommend doing the liver cleanse.
[02:29:09.291 --> 02:29:10.271]  First, the deep cleanse.
[02:29:10.271 --> 02:29:12.392]  You will feel fantastic afterwards.
[02:29:13.272 --> 02:29:14.253]  That's just the first review.
[02:29:14.253 --> 02:29:15.715]  I didn't even look at it before I read it.
[02:29:15.715 --> 02:29:17.017]  Five stars.
[02:29:17.017 --> 02:29:19.419]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:29:19.419 --> 02:29:26.307]  And most of the reviews we can't allow, and we block them ourselves because of the claims people are making.
[02:29:26.307 --> 02:29:27.568]  It's just too dramatic.

[02:29:39.977 --> 02:29:44.960]  We'll talk to these callers and more and have our guest in studio straight ahead.
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:48.262]  But bottom line, the new offensive's being launched, they're coming after our guys.
[02:29:48.262 --> 02:29:52.004]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.004 --> 02:29:54.686]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.905 --> 02:30:06.368]  The United States has called in airstrikes to stop the Taliban from taking control of opium fields in Afghanistan.
[02:30:06.368 --> 02:30:13.070]  Over the weekend, the airstrikes were called in after the Taliban seized weapons and vehicles from Afghan soldiers.
[02:30:13.070 --> 02:30:22.593]  Helmand province is said to be one of the world's largest opium-producing regions, larger than the whole of Burma, which is the second largest producer of opium.
[02:30:22.593 --> 02:30:27.295]  Production of opium reached an all-time high under the military control of the U.S.
[02:30:27.295 --> 02:30:27.835]  and NATO.
[02:30:28.975 --> 02:30:39.157]  According to a report issued in 2013 by the Afghanistan Opium Survey of the United Nations, cultivation of poppy increased 36% in 2013.
[02:30:39.157 --> 02:30:46.059]  Total opium production amounted to 5,500 tons, up nearly half since 2012.
[02:30:46.059 --> 02:30:53.040]  And prior to the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan, the Taliban had successfully blocked production of opium.
[02:30:53.040 --> 02:30:56.001]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[02:32:28.141 --> 02:32:29.281]  BrainForce is here.
[02:32:29.281 --> 02:32:31.502]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:32:31.502 --> 02:32:36.484]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:32:36.484 --> 02:32:38.185]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[02:32:38.185 --> 02:32:39.765]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:32:39.765 --> 02:32:43.267]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:32:43.267 --> 02:32:45.247]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:32:45.247 --> 02:32:46.168]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:32:46.168 --> 02:32:47.348]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:32:47.348 --> 02:32:49.349]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[02:32:49.349 --> 02:32:54.951]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:32:58.012 --> 02:32:59.333]  We've got it.
[02:32:59.333 --> 02:33:05.118]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:33:05.118 --> 02:33:09.481]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:09.481 --> 02:33:17.067]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:17.067 --> 02:33:18.328]  We've got it.
[02:33:28.209 --> 02:33:29.090]  We're good.
[02:33:54.584 --> 02:34:02.510]  September and October 2015 could be looked back on in years to come as the most tumultuous in generations.
[02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:08.194]  The Chinese economic meltdown is in full swing and its impact on the rest of the world is painful.
[02:34:08.194 --> 02:34:12.157]  The economies of developing countries were the first to take the hit.
[02:34:12.737 --> 02:34:18.102]  And now stock markets in 23 different countries around the world are crashing.
[02:34:18.102 --> 02:34:21.284]  Now it's our turn, and it's going to be painful.
[02:34:21.284 --> 02:34:26.589]  The Dow Jones just lost 6% in a week, tumbling more than 1,000 points, the worst since 2008.
[02:34:30.732 --> 02:34:36.818]  Expect a short-term rally in response, but the long-term picture is potentially devastating.
[02:34:36.818 --> 02:34:42.984]  In fact, some indications show that the Dow has to drop to as low as 5,000 before it reaches the bottom.
[02:34:42.984 --> 02:34:48.730]  And even as investors resort to panic selling, some sectors of the establishment financial media
[02:34:49.210 --> 02:34:53.054]  Are still peddling this delusion that we're in a bull market.
[02:34:53.054 --> 02:34:59.139]  Analysts are still bullish on Apple, despite shares plummeting 20% from their all-time high.
[02:34:59.139 --> 02:35:07.386]  CNBC is encouraging people to pour more money into the stock market, claiming that the collapse is merely a dull year.
[02:35:07.386 --> 02:35:09.588]  Others are calling it a correction.
[02:35:09.588 --> 02:35:15.914]  When this kind of blind faith begins to take hold, you know that the bottom is about to drop out.
[02:35:16.354 --> 02:35:20.497]  This is exactly what we saw back in 2006.
[02:35:20.497 --> 02:35:21.558]  Remember this.
[02:35:21.558 --> 02:35:24.580]  There's no tax increase coming in the next couple of years.
[02:35:24.580 --> 02:35:26.741]  Monetary policy is spectacular.
[02:35:26.741 --> 02:35:28.923]  We have freer trade than ever before.
[02:35:28.923 --> 02:35:32.385]  And not only that, but there are no incomes policies things here.
[02:35:32.385 --> 02:35:37.829]  I think Peter's just totally off base, and I don't think it's going to be... I mean, I just don't know where he's getting his stuff.
[02:35:37.829 --> 02:35:41.151]  Well, one of us is off base, but it's definitely not me.
[02:35:41.511 --> 02:35:43.893]  I mean, it's not wealth that's increased in the last few years.
[02:35:43.893 --> 02:35:46.295]  We haven't increased our productive capacity.
[02:35:46.295 --> 02:35:50.178]  All that's increased is the paper values of our stocks and real estate.
[02:35:50.178 --> 02:35:53.900]  But that's not real wealth, no more than Nasdaq was wealth.
[02:35:53.900 --> 02:35:59.484]  When you see the stock market come down and the real estate bubble burst, all that phony wealth is going to evaporate.
[02:35:59.484 --> 02:36:02.687]  And all that's going to be left is all the debt that we accumulated to foreigners.
[02:36:02.927 --> 02:36:04.968]  Peter, I'm going to take a bet with you on this one.
[02:36:04.968 --> 02:36:13.190]  I'll bet you a penny on this one that if you'll sign a letter saying that if you're wrong, you'll sign a letter that you were wrong to me in this, but you're just way off base.
[02:36:13.190 --> 02:36:17.352]  There is nothing out there that tells us we're going to have a nice slowdown, but it's not going to be a crash.
[02:36:17.352 --> 02:36:18.572]  All right, let me ask you this.
[02:36:18.572 --> 02:36:19.912]  I'll bet you a lot more than a penny.
[02:36:19.912 --> 02:36:31.356]  And just as they laughed at Peter Schiff back in 2006, those warning of a coming collapse have been mocked into silence, despite the fact that they're already being proven right.
[02:36:31.756 --> 02:36:39.101]  Oil prices, which signal true economic health, just suffered the longest streak of losses since 1986.
[02:36:39.101 --> 02:36:42.544]  Gold is soaring again as investors flee to safety.
[02:36:42.544 --> 02:36:44.905]  The crisis is truly global.
[02:36:44.905 --> 02:36:56.374]  The Chinese meltdown has wrecked emerging economies with reduced demand causing currencies to plunge, setting the stage for what the AP predicts could be a crippling fall.
[02:36:56.914 --> 02:37:04.640]  But as Peter Schiff explains, the Chinese meltdown may be to blame for the latest downturn, but they're not telling you the whole story.
[02:37:04.640 --> 02:37:09.885]  Which is that this stock market bubble was not based on a real economic recovery.
[02:37:09.885 --> 02:37:16.350]  It was based on the hot air of quantitative easing and artificially low interest rates.
[02:37:16.350 --> 02:37:19.973]  Once QE3 was tapered, stocks went sideways.
[02:37:20.433 --> 02:37:24.474]  And as soon as an interest rate rise was on the horizon, they tanked.
[02:37:24.474 --> 02:37:27.415]  Because none of those gains were real.
[02:37:27.415 --> 02:37:33.917]  It wasn't because the economy improved, because we became more productive, because of a genuine increase in corporate earnings.
[02:37:33.917 --> 02:37:36.937]  It was all about Fed engineering.
[02:37:36.937 --> 02:37:40.899]  It was quantitative easing and 0% interest rates.
[02:37:40.899 --> 02:37:42.099]  Those were the two props.
[02:37:42.679 --> 02:37:42.959]  That's right.
[02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:07.201]  But the markets have still been teetering on the second prop, which is 0% interest rates.
[02:38:07.201 --> 02:38:09.862]  But now everybody thinks the Fed's going to remove that prop.
[02:38:09.862 --> 02:38:13.403]  Well then there's nothing beneath the market but a bunch of air, right?
[02:38:13.403 --> 02:38:15.203]  And the market is going to tank.
[02:38:15.203 --> 02:38:24.306]  We're seeing a global currency war emerge as developing countries desperately try to make their exports more attractive by devaluing their currencies.
[02:38:24.306 --> 02:38:28.527]  September and October are really shaping up to be pivotal moments.
[02:38:52.134 --> 02:38:56.201]  That's Frank Zappa bringing us in with the slime.
[02:39:05.996 --> 02:39:12.880]  Guys, you did a great job grabbing it quickly off the internet, but to that cost, kind of a glitch coming in, so we aired part of a Paul Watson report here.
[02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:20.185]  This is live, three hours of radio slash TV to counter the establishment media.
[02:39:20.185 --> 02:39:26.369]  We didn't have any train wrecks today, but our crew does a great job compared to folks getting shot, obviously, in Virginia.
[02:39:26.369 --> 02:39:29.611]  Very tragic, I'm very sad for their two deaths.
[02:39:29.611 --> 02:39:34.394]  The video, first person point of view shooting by a deranged
[02:39:35.134 --> 02:39:37.375]  Apparently racist black guy.
[02:39:37.375 --> 02:39:43.099]  Very similar to the shooting situation that happened in Charleston.
[02:39:43.099 --> 02:39:50.804]  Except that was even more cold-blooded because the young man in question didn't know eight of the nine people he shot.
[02:39:53.223 --> 02:40:02.889]  But it's this whole race war where the problems in our life are people of other colors, not the economic policies, not what's actually happening in the world.
[02:40:02.889 --> 02:40:09.533]  Julia Toriansky is a very interesting documentary filmmaker, radio TV host, bravetheworld.com.
[02:40:09.533 --> 02:40:11.274]  We've been covering her stuff for years.
[02:40:11.274 --> 02:40:13.756]  You know, as Paul Watson's interviewed her quite a bit.
[02:40:13.756 --> 02:40:15.737]  She's been here in Austin the last week.
[02:40:15.737 --> 02:40:20.880]  And so I thought, well, why not have her in studio to talk about feminism and some of the topics that are
[02:40:21.801 --> 02:40:25.245]  Taking place, but now we have this big mass shooting that's happened.
[02:40:25.245 --> 02:40:28.108]  I promised to go to your calls, but now they're about five minutes behind.
[02:40:28.108 --> 02:40:36.358]  I'm going to have to do a little bit of overdrive to be able to finish those, so we'll do that as well for Doug and others that have been patiently holding.
[02:40:36.358 --> 02:40:38.120]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:40:38.120 --> 02:40:40.742]  There is a big push to demonize the Second Amendment.
[02:40:41.303 --> 02:40:45.426]  There is a big push, obviously, to demonize people being able to defend themselves.
[02:40:45.426 --> 02:40:47.867]  Julia, what do you want to tackle first?
[02:40:47.867 --> 02:40:49.709]  I know there's a lot of issues, a lot of news.
[02:40:49.709 --> 02:40:52.050]  You cover a lot of different angles.
[02:40:52.050 --> 02:40:59.415]  You try to get off of the paradigm and get off the left-right reservation.
[02:40:59.415 --> 02:41:00.536]  Where do you see the world going?
[02:41:01.294 --> 02:41:09.478]  Well, I just came from San Francisco to Austin, which has been a really incredible culture shock and kind of a positive direction.
[02:41:09.478 --> 02:41:21.163]  And as you mentioned, San Francisco has this incredible homelessness problem, and it's just an example of how governments compound and augment problems that they claim to have been fixing.
[02:41:21.163 --> 02:41:23.464]  So what happens in San Francisco specifically is
[02:41:24.404 --> 02:41:35.629]  They ship, places like New York give homeless people a one-way ticket to a bus and ship them to a warmer place like San Francisco and they all go there because San Francisco spends $167 million a year.
[02:41:39.611 --> 02:41:41.031]  On their homeless.
[02:41:41.031 --> 02:41:49.274]  But then they take away basic services like public toilets because of the fear of drug use and confined private spaces.
[02:41:49.274 --> 02:41:56.816]  So they shipple the homeless there, they make the illusion of providing services and taking care of them, and then they take away public toilets.
[02:41:56.816 --> 02:41:58.316]  And then you get what you get.
[02:41:58.316 --> 02:42:04.438]  Drudge has the image, it's an epidemic of people defecating on the streets.
[02:42:04.438 --> 02:42:04.738]  It is.
[02:42:04.738 --> 02:42:06.159]  I've been there.
[02:42:06.159 --> 02:42:06.679]  I've seen it.
[02:42:09.278 --> 02:42:12.380]  I mean, the last few times I went to San Francisco, it's really creepy now.
[02:42:12.380 --> 02:42:20.507]  It looks like a zombie apocalypse with just bombed out of their brain or mentally ill homeless people wandering around everywhere, basically crapping on themselves.
[02:42:20.507 --> 02:42:22.268]  And I guess this is the liberal heaven?
[02:42:22.268 --> 02:42:24.030]  Yeah, and the entirety of California.
[02:42:24.030 --> 02:42:28.534]  I mean, I can't speak for each individual, but they're all hypocrites.
[02:42:28.534 --> 02:42:32.797]  You look at, they're all claiming to be anti-racist, but they,
[02:42:33.658 --> 02:42:41.663]  They totally back Planned Parenthood, which is an anti-black eugenist program, originally.
[02:42:41.663 --> 02:42:43.824]  You can look that up.
[02:42:43.824 --> 02:42:44.525]  Margaret Sanger.
[02:42:44.525 --> 02:42:45.726]  It's out there.
[02:42:45.726 --> 02:42:47.086]  It's not even conspiracy theory.
[02:42:47.086 --> 02:42:55.131]  They claim to be tolerant, but if you disagree with them, they just get infuriated, start yelling at you.
[02:42:56.312 --> 02:43:08.982]  Feminists, yet they don't support gun rights, and gun rights and gun ownership is actually congruent with feminism, and I think gun ownership is actually a contingent of true equality, not sameness, but true equality.
[02:43:08.982 --> 02:43:09.502]  Absolutely!
[02:43:09.502 --> 02:43:15.907]  Why does government and rich people and elites get to have guns and bodyguards, but then we don't individually get to have them?
[02:43:15.907 --> 02:43:16.928]  That's just outrageous!
[02:43:17.228 --> 02:43:21.413]  And how dare Hillary with all these armed guards say that you or I can't have guns.
[02:43:21.413 --> 02:43:23.075]  Now tell folks a little bit about yourself.
[02:43:23.075 --> 02:43:29.823]  As we Google your name, we can see you there posing with guns and that's always exciting to see folks doing that.
[02:43:29.823 --> 02:43:31.485]  I mean it's just so no-brainer.
[02:43:31.485 --> 02:43:32.746]  If you want to empower women,
[02:43:33.584 --> 02:43:34.005]  We're good to go.
[02:43:49.622 --> 02:43:57.824]  Yeah, Alex, they run all these anti-rape campaigns and vilify men and think there's a, you know, one out of every three men is a rapist.
[02:43:57.824 --> 02:43:59.385]  And then they take your guns away.
[02:43:59.385 --> 02:44:02.266]  As a woman, I'm like 120 pounds.
[02:44:02.266 --> 02:44:16.450]  If I'm at home alone, especially with my little kids or my family, you know, people who are dependent on me for protection, and someone breaks into my home, I am almost, I'm very likely to be less physically
[02:44:18.150 --> 02:44:21.932]  Uh, able to protect myself than a man, than a grown man.
[02:44:21.932 --> 02:44:23.994]  Most men can physically take me.
[02:44:23.994 --> 02:44:26.175]  I need a gun to equalize me.
[02:44:26.175 --> 02:44:26.795]  I need it.
[02:44:26.795 --> 02:44:31.138]  Because if I don't, even if he has a gun, at least we're on an even playing field.
[02:44:31.138 --> 02:44:32.659]  Guns are an incredible liberator.
[02:44:32.659 --> 02:44:33.239]  Right.
[02:44:33.239 --> 02:44:34.500]  And people don't understand that.
[02:44:34.500 --> 02:44:36.761]  And to me, the whole gun debate is over.
[02:44:36.761 --> 02:44:41.564]  You can print a gun, you can, even before you could print a gun, you can just make a gun at home.
[02:44:41.564 --> 02:44:44.186]  This is why places like D.C.
[02:44:44.186 --> 02:44:47.488]  have the highest gun crime, because they get guns illegally anyways.
[02:44:47.748 --> 02:44:48.489]  Let me ask you this.
[02:44:48.489 --> 02:45:01.366]  Why do you think, because the statistics show this, that the gun culture, not just here but worldwide, is so popular and people don't believe the propaganda anymore, and even the left, I know, are out quietly buying guns the last six, seven years.
[02:45:01.366 --> 02:45:02.488]  Why do you think that's happening?
[02:45:03.257 --> 02:45:14.700]  I think even the progressives, when they go out there and experience life and experience the real world, they will have the state step on them in some way or another.
[02:45:14.700 --> 02:45:22.682]  And maybe even deep down inside on a dinosaur level, their dinosaur brain tells them to protect themselves.
[02:45:22.682 --> 02:45:27.843]  Because at some point, unless you're a total vegetable, you'll realize that nobody's gonna protect you.
[02:45:28.343 --> 02:45:30.324]  You have to protect yourself.
[02:45:30.324 --> 02:45:33.786]  And I don't care how they sell it or how they wrap it up.
[02:45:33.786 --> 02:45:41.691]  At the end of the day, even the best, most well-run, most funded government will not protect you fast enough.
[02:45:41.691 --> 02:45:42.991]  Yeah, where was the government?
[02:45:42.991 --> 02:45:45.533]  Where were the cops to protect these news reporters?
[02:45:45.533 --> 02:45:47.254]  And the message is, it's not their job.
[02:45:47.254 --> 02:45:48.334]  They can't do it.
[02:45:48.334 --> 02:45:49.115]  It's impossible.
[02:45:49.355 --> 02:45:58.120]  Yeah, there's been cases of fires burning and people screaming and the cops standing around waiting for orders not knowing what to do.
[02:45:58.120 --> 02:46:04.984]  And meanwhile you're funding them with your tax dollars for protection and your family burns alive or is getting murdered in your house.
[02:46:04.984 --> 02:46:09.807]  And that's because the cops are told you only do stuff when you're ordered or you'll be fired.
[02:46:09.807 --> 02:46:14.890]  In the past the cops would just go in but now it's so compartmentalized they wait and follow their orders.
[02:46:14.890 --> 02:46:17.472]  Like when there's a mass shooting the cops would sit around for hours.
[02:46:18.248 --> 02:46:18.928]  Oh my god.
[02:46:18.928 --> 02:46:22.030]  In some cases, depending on the jurisdiction, because it's their orders.
[02:46:22.030 --> 02:46:24.492]  So where's all this money going to?
[02:46:24.492 --> 02:46:26.073]  Where's all our tax dollars going to?
[02:46:26.073 --> 02:46:33.317]  You know, the state, I think what's happened now is the state is obsessed with preventing events from occurring.
[02:46:33.317 --> 02:46:34.577]  It's all about control.
[02:46:34.577 --> 02:46:44.243]  So they want to create the illusion of preventative measures, which is impossible, because people will go crazy, there are bad people in the world, and they will do bad things.
[02:46:44.243 --> 02:46:45.664]  You cannot prevent that.
[02:46:45.964 --> 02:46:48.965]  Well sure, there's discussions about banning tubing in Texas.
[02:46:48.965 --> 02:46:52.466]  They've actually discussed it because so many hundreds of ankles get broken.
[02:46:52.466 --> 02:46:56.268]  Well big deal, I know going over waterfalls in an inner tube I could break my ankle.
[02:46:56.268 --> 02:46:57.608]  I know my kids could get hurt.
[02:46:57.608 --> 02:46:59.509]  That's part of life on this planet.
[02:46:59.509 --> 02:47:02.610]  I mean, you don't get stronger unless you go through stuff like that.
[02:47:02.610 --> 02:47:04.991]  I don't send them over white rapids, but I mean...
[02:47:06.431 --> 02:47:11.636]  I'll go to the beach, and people will say, there could be jellyfish out there, don't let your kids go in.
[02:47:11.636 --> 02:47:17.541]  And there'll be like hundreds of kids playing, and I go, well I know it's not perfectly safe, but it's this weird culture.
[02:47:17.541 --> 02:47:19.523]  Like I was going down to the hike and bike trail with my kids.
[02:47:20.578 --> 02:47:23.822]  About a month ago, and it had been flooding like a week before.
[02:47:23.822 --> 02:47:24.803]  It's totally safe now.
[02:47:24.803 --> 02:47:26.385]  It wasn't even going fast.
[02:47:26.385 --> 02:47:28.267]  Got down there, there were people swimming and everything.
[02:47:28.267 --> 02:47:29.929]  Some rainstorms were blowing over.
[02:47:29.929 --> 02:47:32.933]  I'd looked on my phone, knew they were blowing over, were going to be gone.
[02:47:32.933 --> 02:47:37.759]  It was raining, and this guy on a mountain bike goes, hey, you going down there with those kids?
[02:47:37.759 --> 02:47:38.300]  It's flooding.
[02:47:38.300 --> 02:47:38.941]  It's not safe.
[02:47:38.941 --> 02:47:39.621]  Storms are coming.
[02:47:40.365 --> 02:47:41.986]  And I didn't even say anything.
[02:47:41.986 --> 02:47:44.568]  I didn't say, hey, I looked on my phone beforehand.
[02:47:44.568 --> 02:47:45.609]  It's safe.
[02:47:45.609 --> 02:47:47.671]  Hey, it's about to get sunny, which it did five minutes later.
[02:47:47.671 --> 02:47:50.373]  I mean, the radar tells the truth.
[02:47:50.373 --> 02:47:51.694]  I just ignored the guy.
[02:47:51.694 --> 02:47:53.515]  I didn't even say, hey, mind your business.
[02:47:53.515 --> 02:47:55.296]  But I mean, it's a nanny state interview.
[02:47:55.296 --> 02:47:56.357]  It's sick, though.
[02:47:56.357 --> 02:47:56.998]  What do you make of that?
[02:47:57.486 --> 02:48:19.464]  Well, you know we live in a world of systematic surveillance, aerial strikes, ground drills, everything is watched, everything is attempted to be controlled, and the worst, the resulting thing that happens is society becomes very flaccid and jellyfish-like.
[02:48:19.844 --> 02:48:21.646]  So now instead of... Stagnant.
[02:48:21.646 --> 02:48:33.600]  Yeah, and soft, too, because now instead of people confronting their issues with others, they call the police, or they call a service, or they, you know, they go... My hamburger's not hot, I'm calling the police.
[02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:34.381]  Yeah, and there's this...
[02:48:34.721 --> 02:48:44.227]  There's this apotheosis of the state, and we think they're God, but if the state is God, then it's a sacrificial God, and where are the people who are being sacrificed to it?
[02:48:44.227 --> 02:48:52.212]  Because if you call a higher authority, which the state is now a higher power to most people, then you are not an individual anymore.
[02:48:52.212 --> 02:48:53.713]  You are relying on somebody else.
[02:48:53.713 --> 02:48:59.016]  It's like if you're a 40-year-old man, and you still call your mommy to make you lunch.
[02:48:59.016 --> 02:49:00.577]  I mean, it's just that on an extreme.
[02:49:00.677 --> 02:49:04.120]  No, they're saying children, dreamers, are up to age 30.
[02:49:04.120 --> 02:49:07.564]  And they're saying that's the new, you become a man or a woman at 30.
[02:49:07.564 --> 02:49:11.988]  And that stemmed from making child work illegal, right?
[02:49:11.988 --> 02:49:17.314]  What was the point of making children under a certain age illegal to work?
[02:49:17.314 --> 02:49:19.796]  It was to keep them children until they were like 25.
[02:49:20.697 --> 02:49:40.175]  I was about to say, there were certainly abuses covered in the Jungle and other publications that the Rockefellers were doing, but now they want to ban your kids taking the trash out or getting eggs out of a chicken coop, and they admit that is so they're a bunch of babbling idiots and aren't confident, when in truth what you did in the old days is you apprenticed your sons, mainly, but daughters as well,
[02:49:40.816 --> 02:49:41.557]  We're good to go.
[02:49:55.794 --> 02:49:57.015]  They can't build anything.
[02:49:57.015 --> 02:49:58.376]  They can't fix anything.
[02:49:58.376 --> 02:50:02.418]  They have to call somebody for anything that needs to be done.
[02:50:02.418 --> 02:50:04.800]  And my father comes from that same generation.
[02:50:04.800 --> 02:50:06.061]  He grew up in the Soviet Union.
[02:50:06.061 --> 02:50:07.282]  You can't call anybody.
[02:50:07.282 --> 02:50:09.603]  You got to do everything by yourself.
[02:50:09.603 --> 02:50:12.245]  And in a system like that, you have to use black markets.
[02:50:12.245 --> 02:50:14.827]  And now it's like, oh, the toilet breaks.
[02:50:14.827 --> 02:50:18.289]  I have to pay someone because I don't have a license to do this.
[02:50:18.289 --> 02:50:22.111]  So it's and it's a deterioration of everybody.
[02:50:22.111 --> 02:50:22.912]  And I mean,
[02:50:23.012 --> 02:50:26.115]  I'm going to skip this break because we're low on time and I came in a few minutes late.
[02:50:26.115 --> 02:50:27.296]  I apologize for that.
[02:50:27.296 --> 02:50:28.277]  Should have told you guys that.
[02:50:28.277 --> 02:50:28.597]  Absolutely.
[02:50:28.597 --> 02:50:34.083]  Let's take some calls and we'll do some overdrive into the next hour so we have more time to flesh all this out.
[02:50:34.083 --> 02:50:36.345]  We have our guest joining us here from Toronto, Canada.
[02:50:36.345 --> 02:50:39.208]  So I was up in Toronto and I came to Austin to give a speech.
[02:50:39.628 --> 02:50:49.470]  And then you were down here, and I remember first seeing you reporting with Paul Watson about three years ago in Copenhagen and Bilderberg, and I've seen some of you guys' joint work, so it's good to have you here joining us.
[02:50:49.470 --> 02:50:50.190]  Thank you.
[02:50:50.190 --> 02:50:53.350]  Let's go ahead and talk to Doug in Minnesota.
[02:50:53.350 --> 02:50:54.171]  Thank you for holding, Doug.
[02:50:54.171 --> 02:50:54.911]  You're a real trooper.
[02:50:54.911 --> 02:50:56.471]  Go ahead.
[02:50:56.471 --> 02:50:57.951]  Hey, how are you guys doing today?
[02:50:57.951 --> 02:51:00.992]  Good, brother.
[02:51:00.992 --> 02:51:07.033]  It's a terrible thing what happened at that news station, but what's even a worse thing
[02:51:07.915 --> 02:51:17.861]  Because all the cemeteries that we've filled with our soldiers and our police have fought for the freedoms and the rights of people in this country.
[02:51:17.861 --> 02:51:21.162]  And it appears as though a lot of people are forgetting about that.
[02:51:21.162 --> 02:51:23.964]  They're forgetting how we got to this point.
[02:51:23.964 --> 02:51:27.246]  And they're so willing to just give it up and throw it away.
[02:51:27.246 --> 02:51:32.689]  You know, and I'm for taking the guns away, but not from the people.
[02:51:32.689 --> 02:51:36.071]  I'm for taking it away from Al Qaeda, ISIS, ISIL.
[02:51:36.761 --> 02:51:37.402]  We're good to go.
[02:51:58.740 --> 02:52:09.955]  Sure, he talks about a domestic security force just as big, just as strong as our military, and that is his Akron Youth Brigade's classic, you know, Mussolini-style garbage.
[02:52:09.955 --> 02:52:13.660]  By the way, now they're reporting that Vester had
[02:52:15.168 --> 02:52:17.270]  Vester Flanagan had a manifesto.
[02:52:17.270 --> 02:52:21.793]  So we're going to go into overdrive in the next hour, continue your calls and break some of that down.
[02:52:21.793 --> 02:52:24.635]  But this thing is looking more and more bizarre.
[02:52:24.635 --> 02:52:28.798]  And this guy looks like one of the fruitiest nutballs.
[02:52:28.798 --> 02:52:34.142]  I mean, all these mass shooters that have weird questionable government connections look like they come from Mars.
[02:52:34.142 --> 02:52:36.944]  But this guy looks like a Muppet or something.
[02:52:36.944 --> 02:52:39.766]  I mean, does anyone in their mind, he used to be handsome.
[02:52:40.346 --> 02:52:41.328]  And a pretty good reporter.
[02:52:41.328 --> 02:52:43.070]  We found some of his old reports.
[02:52:43.070 --> 02:52:45.773]  Now he looks like he's been on something.
[02:52:45.773 --> 02:52:47.695]  I think this guy was in somebody's clutches.
[02:52:47.695 --> 02:52:48.997]  I'm not sure of that.
[02:52:48.997 --> 02:52:53.943]  He just looks like he's been in a mental ward for five years on Thorazine.
[02:52:53.943 --> 02:52:55.524]  Something is wrong with this guy.
[02:52:55.524 --> 02:52:58.468]  I bet money he was on some type of psychotropic.
[02:52:58.468 --> 02:52:59.029]  What do you guess?
[02:53:00.280 --> 02:53:01.701]  I'll take another direction.
[02:53:01.701 --> 02:53:04.362]  So let's say he's not drugged, let's say he's not crazy.
[02:53:04.362 --> 02:53:06.643]  I've never seen them when they are drugged.
[02:53:06.643 --> 02:53:08.984]  But let's say they're not.
[02:53:08.984 --> 02:53:22.750]  This could be a direct result of how American people, especially the left progressives, they have chosen to internalize racism instead of actually putting things out on the table and being straightforward about it.
[02:53:22.750 --> 02:53:24.591]  And this goes back to what Malcolm X would say.
[02:53:25.311 --> 02:53:35.906]  And if you look at one of the speeches he did, he talked about how there's this consensus that the South is racist and the North is anti-racist.
[02:53:35.906 --> 02:53:41.034]  Guess which people moved out of their neighborhoods when the blacks came into their neighborhoods?
[02:53:41.494 --> 02:53:47.898]  The Democrat Northerners moved out of their neighborhoods immediately as soon as black populations came in.
[02:53:47.898 --> 02:53:56.323]  The Southerners lived alongside with their black neighbors and vetted their frustrations and found a way to co-live and get along.
[02:53:56.323 --> 02:53:59.205]  So when you... Well yeah, that's the cultures are pretty much the same in the South.
[02:53:59.804 --> 02:54:10.086]  Yeah, but it shows that the way to deal with racist mentality is to have it out in the open, not internalize it and censor people.
[02:54:10.086 --> 02:54:13.226]  Because, like today, we have nothing on the book burners.
[02:54:13.226 --> 02:54:14.727]  We have nothing on the Third Reich.
[02:54:14.727 --> 02:54:18.067]  We have nothing on the socialist censorship.
[02:54:18.067 --> 02:54:20.307]  Oh, the left now is hardcore censors.
[02:54:20.307 --> 02:54:24.068]  Yeah, in America today, we have nothing on the book burners.
[02:54:24.068 --> 02:54:27.249]  We are just as bad, maybe to a different extreme.
[02:54:27.249 --> 02:54:29.129]  And the Canadians are even worse.
[02:54:29.429 --> 02:54:30.130]  Oh, the Canadians.
[02:54:30.130 --> 02:54:33.413]  You can't even have a legitimate conversation with a Canadian person.
[02:54:33.413 --> 02:54:34.974]  They're scared to voice any opinion.
[02:54:34.974 --> 02:54:37.316]  And that's the goal.
[02:54:37.316 --> 02:54:39.018]  We said they'd ban Old Glory next.
[02:54:39.018 --> 02:54:41.921]  Now schools are banning all flags.
[02:54:41.921 --> 02:54:44.183]  Then soon all images are evil.
[02:54:44.383 --> 02:54:56.597]  Yeah, I know a man who lost his entire career and has been totally discredited and slandered because he used the term House Negro, describing a situation where it actually happened.
[02:54:56.597 --> 02:54:58.940]  And we had Cynthia McKinney, the first
[02:54:59.540 --> 02:55:04.425]  A black female congresswoman from Georgia support this man and she's a black woman.
[02:55:04.425 --> 02:55:17.458]  She said yes, what he said was true and that the Canadian government and specific schools censored him and sued him and used two million dollars of student money to get this guy out.
[02:55:17.938 --> 02:55:18.758]  Well, that's what it is.
[02:55:18.758 --> 02:55:22.339]  They want to be able to arrest people or ruin them for their speech.
[02:55:22.339 --> 02:55:25.100]  This is very, very dangerous totalitarianism.
[02:55:25.100 --> 02:55:27.540]  Again, a lot of stations leave us when we start the next hour.
[02:55:27.540 --> 02:55:32.001]  Infowars.com forward slash show to find the free feeds.
[02:55:32.001 --> 02:55:34.441]  This is going to be pushed because it is dramatic.
[02:55:34.441 --> 02:55:38.402]  I mean, it deserves to be a big story because the footage is so horrific.
[02:55:38.402 --> 02:55:39.583]  We played some of it earlier.
[02:55:39.583 --> 02:55:42.023]  I don't want to continue to play it anymore.
[02:55:42.023 --> 02:55:45.664]  The raw video is on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:55:45.664 --> 02:55:46.224]  But understand,
[02:55:48.106 --> 02:55:52.592]  Just because we see this makes it personable and makes it personal and makes it hurt.
[02:55:52.592 --> 02:55:59.480]  Imagine all the innocent people being killed by Al Qaeda and other globalist forces being funded by our government.
[02:55:59.480 --> 02:56:02.284]  Or what's happening in Ukraine, started by our government again.
[02:56:02.284 --> 02:56:05.368]  You can say what you want about the Russians, but our government started it.
[02:56:05.368 --> 02:56:06.409]  You look at all this,
[02:56:07.469 --> 02:56:16.092]  This is a very, very, very dangerous time and this whole thing is becoming a distraction from the huge crimes that are taking place.
[02:56:16.092 --> 02:56:21.134]  And Alex, we should also acknowledge the black-on-black crime that has been engineered by the government.
[02:56:21.134 --> 02:56:25.535]  Between 75 and 90 percent of all crime against blacks is by other blacks.
[02:56:25.595 --> 02:56:36.759]  And they've been engineered to turn on each other and to have these gangs and the wars and even the hip hop culture has become, has been engineered to turn on itself.
[02:56:36.759 --> 02:56:42.721]  And you can listen to artists like Kendrick Lamar, who's like one of the only people who acknowledges this issue.
[02:56:42.721 --> 02:56:47.482]  Like, why are we, we can't criticize anybody until we stop killing ourselves.
[02:56:47.482 --> 02:56:54.045]  And this is again a direct result of state intervention in their neighborhoods and the way people have been programmed to
[02:56:57.746 --> 02:56:58.447]  Absolutely.
[02:56:58.447 --> 02:56:59.807]  Let's go to another caller here.
[02:56:59.807 --> 02:57:00.568]  Thanks for holding.
[02:57:00.568 --> 02:57:01.508]  Matt.
[02:57:01.508 --> 02:57:02.609]  Matt in Washington.
[02:57:02.609 --> 02:57:03.229]  You're on the air.
[02:57:03.229 --> 02:57:05.570]  Thanks for holding.
[02:57:05.570 --> 02:57:06.291]  Hello, Alex.
[02:57:06.291 --> 02:57:06.571]  Yes, sir.
[02:57:06.571 --> 02:57:08.452]  Go ahead.
[02:57:08.452 --> 02:57:11.213]  I just wanted to comment on Bill and Hillary for a second.
[02:57:11.213 --> 02:57:12.314]  Is that okay?
[02:57:12.314 --> 02:57:14.015]  Sir, I'm not going to screen your call live on air.
[02:57:14.015 --> 02:57:14.795]  I mean, you're live.
[02:57:14.795 --> 02:57:16.977]  Of course you can talk about whatever you want.
[02:57:16.977 --> 02:57:19.558]  Okay, so when Hillary and Obama disappeared,
[02:57:20.350 --> 02:57:22.012]  On their little meeting and they ditched the press.
[02:57:22.012 --> 02:57:28.017]  Do you think that Hillary was given a deal to like back out and she'd be promised the election in 2016?
[02:57:28.017 --> 02:57:29.999]  I don't know what happened inside that Vildenberg meeting.
[02:57:29.999 --> 02:57:31.020]  I just know they were there.
[02:57:31.020 --> 02:57:32.001]  It was a huge story.
[02:57:32.001 --> 02:57:33.262]  We knew they were there.
[02:57:33.262 --> 02:57:34.243]  The Secret Service was there.
[02:57:34.243 --> 02:57:37.747]  They aimed guns at us and no dinosaur media would come out.
[02:57:37.747 --> 02:57:43.031]  The Epoch Times, the Falun Gong publication came out and covered it.
[02:57:43.031 --> 02:57:44.213]  Drudge linked to it.
[02:57:45.273 --> 02:57:46.294]  That was it.
[02:57:46.294 --> 02:57:52.218]  No coverage of the huge event of them disappearing for a day in a secret meeting.
[02:57:52.218 --> 02:57:56.582]  And the media was so controlled, when we called them, they knew they were there.
[02:57:56.582 --> 02:57:59.144]  But they knew not to cover it.
[02:57:59.144 --> 02:57:59.944]  So that's amazing.
[02:57:59.944 --> 02:58:01.666]  But how the worm has turned.
[02:58:01.666 --> 02:58:03.407]  I saw a mainstream news article.
[02:58:03.407 --> 02:58:05.509]  I meant to cover it last week.
[02:58:05.509 --> 02:58:08.931]  I forget where it was, but... I think it was Newsweek.
[02:58:08.931 --> 02:58:10.673]  Yeah, it was Newsweek.
[02:58:10.673 --> 02:58:13.215]  The Daily Beast saying that
[02:58:14.694 --> 02:58:18.317]  A leader had gone to their own Bilderberg-type meeting.
[02:58:18.317 --> 02:58:20.238]  And so, now that term is out in the open.
[02:58:20.238 --> 02:58:21.859]  Now it's safer than to report on it.
[02:58:21.859 --> 02:58:22.520]  Stay there, Matt.
[02:58:22.520 --> 02:58:23.260]  I'm back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:23.260 --> 02:58:26.022]  I'm gonna have you finish up the Neal and others.
[02:58:26.022 --> 02:58:30.846]  Stay with us.
[02:58:30.846 --> 02:58:34.829]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[02:59:31.396 --> 02:59:33.837]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:59:50.808 --> 02:59:57.439]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:59:57.439 --> 03:00:00.443]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:09.190 --> 03:00:23.679]  Julia Toriansky is our guest, bravetheworld.com, and she's been part of InfoWars Reports off and on for about three years or so, and she's reaching a lot of people, and that's what's so exciting.
[03:00:23.679 --> 03:00:29.303]  Young women, old women, young men, old men, middle-aged, whatever, they tell you you're supposed to be a kid now until you're 30.
[03:00:30.615 --> 03:00:34.878]  If you're a man, if you're a woman, you've got to be a successful businesswoman by 15.
[03:00:34.878 --> 03:00:42.264]  They want to arrest the development of men, end that culture, not to empower women, but to get ready to bring down the entire society.
[03:00:42.264 --> 03:00:44.926]  And this is all admitted by the globalists.
[03:00:44.926 --> 03:00:46.667]  We're going to do 30 minutes of overdrive.
[03:00:46.667 --> 03:00:56.275]  In the next few weeks, we're going to start doing the whole fourth hour live every day and reactivating all the affiliates that are already coming back on board.
[03:00:57.383 --> 03:01:00.704]  That's why at least once a week, I'm doing the whole fourth hour live.
[03:01:00.704 --> 03:01:07.646]  I'll be in here most days for the fourth hour, but I'll always have a roundtable of guests and my other reporters for us.
[03:01:07.646 --> 03:01:11.326]  So we're bringing the fourth hour back.
[03:01:11.326 --> 03:01:13.867]  Let's go back to Matt.
[03:01:13.867 --> 03:01:16.408]  In Washington, you got to make one point.
[03:01:16.408 --> 03:01:17.468]  What was your other point, Matt?
[03:01:18.584 --> 03:01:22.165]  Well, Mike Fitzsimmons up here in Spokane just worships Ozzy Knezevich.
[03:01:22.165 --> 03:01:26.047]  I called his show and he basically said, oh, it's much ado about nothing.
[03:01:26.047 --> 03:01:27.187]  It's a big deal.
[03:01:27.187 --> 03:01:31.089]  And, you know, I told him, I told him it is a big deal.
[03:01:31.089 --> 03:01:33.350]  He basically hung up on me.
[03:01:33.350 --> 03:01:34.410]  But they just worship that guy.
[03:01:34.410 --> 03:01:39.072]  Another point I wanted to make was that if Trump keeps going, let's say he's elected president.
[03:01:39.594 --> 03:01:41.556]  How is he going to get everything done?
[03:01:41.556 --> 03:01:43.038]  The government is not a corporation.
[03:01:43.038 --> 03:01:46.382]  He can't just go in there and start signing executive orders.
[03:01:46.382 --> 03:01:49.986]  And if he does, are people going to accept it because it's Trump and it's the right thing to do?
[03:01:49.986 --> 03:01:50.927]  Thirdly, music.
[03:01:52.876 --> 03:02:01.840]  I love your diversity in music, and I was just kind of curious on how you came to like so many different styles of music, because I'm the same way, but I'm a musician.
[03:02:01.840 --> 03:02:15.947]  Well, I just listen to whatever I hear, and it doesn't matter whether I'm listening to Indian music, or Middle Eastern music, or African music, or Mexican music, or South American music, or classical, rock and roll, hard rock.
[03:02:16.727 --> 03:02:18.429]  Uh, old-fashioned country.
[03:02:18.429 --> 03:02:25.354]  Only thing I don't like is modern country and modern hip-hop, pop crap.
[03:02:25.354 --> 03:02:30.498]  I mean, a lot of it's got a catchy tune or whatever, but it's just, it's just, it's just modern stuff.
[03:02:30.498 --> 03:02:32.080]  It's not because I'm old.
[03:02:32.080 --> 03:02:33.981]  I hear a lot of new stuff the young people are doing.
[03:02:33.981 --> 03:02:36.503]  It's not establishment, and I really love it.
[03:02:36.503 --> 03:02:43.048]  Uh, but the stuff put out purposefully by the music industry just does not really ever float my boat.
[03:02:43.048 --> 03:02:44.510]  I appreciate your call.
[03:02:44.510 --> 03:02:46.071]  Uh, your take on music as a weapon?
[03:02:47.348 --> 03:03:02.391]  Well, there's just, I think a lot of these artists start out with pure intentions and real spirit and real talent and then they make it and they see also, first of all, they have the influences by the companies after they make it.
[03:03:02.391 --> 03:03:09.253]  Second of all, they have the influence by the herd of the millions of viewers online and the people that listen to them who have been
[03:03:09.893 --> 03:03:20.805]  So intellectually destroyed that all they want to hear is over-sexualized songs with undertones of an aggressive undertone.
[03:03:20.805 --> 03:03:23.448]  It's very adolescent.
[03:03:23.448 --> 03:03:25.010]  It's for little boys that actually haven't...
[03:03:25.771 --> 03:03:29.913]  I watched plenty of interviews with artists who have said that.
[03:03:29.913 --> 03:03:41.979]  They said, well, I put out a music video with a naughty word in the title and I get 15 million views and I put out a piece of music that has depth to it and I get 500,000.
[03:03:41.979 --> 03:03:42.859]  So right now, you know,
[03:03:46.161 --> 03:03:48.202]  Life is imitating art.
[03:03:48.202 --> 03:03:51.063]  Art isn't driving life right now, and we need to reverse that.
[03:03:51.063 --> 03:03:58.945]  I think art and music is a very powerful tool, and we need good art and music to kind of remodel the way that we're thinking.
[03:03:58.945 --> 03:04:08.488]  That's a great point, because they had a really good front line like a decade ago about the feedback loop, and they studied it with experts, and it wasn't that MTV was following what people wanted.
[03:04:08.488 --> 03:04:11.709]  They were force-feeding it to control the agenda.
[03:04:11.769 --> 03:04:13.150]  And that's kind of my tagline.
[03:04:13.150 --> 03:04:17.252]  I have a whole video dedicated to saying, let's escape the feedback loop.
[03:04:17.252 --> 03:04:18.713]  Let's just break away.
[03:04:18.713 --> 03:04:21.615]  And that goes back to the caller's comments about Trump.
[03:04:21.615 --> 03:04:24.036]  We're not going to have a better world with Trump as president.
[03:04:24.036 --> 03:04:24.817]  He's still president.
[03:04:24.817 --> 03:04:26.397]  He's still controlled by the same powers.
[03:04:26.397 --> 03:04:26.898]  Doesn't matter.
[03:04:27.518 --> 03:04:28.639]  But man is he slick.
[03:04:28.639 --> 03:04:29.659]  I watched his two minute response.
[03:04:29.659 --> 03:04:31.080]  I do like watching him.
[03:04:31.080 --> 03:04:37.342]  I watched his response to the Univision reporter and just the way he handled that reporter and kept making him look stupid.
[03:04:37.342 --> 03:04:39.123]  I mean Trump is something else.
[03:04:39.123 --> 03:04:41.164]  He does open eyes because he's been in there.
[03:04:41.164 --> 03:04:42.905]  He's bribed the politicians.
[03:04:42.905 --> 03:04:43.845]  He's seen the favor.
[03:04:43.845 --> 03:04:46.506]  Well see he could get in trouble for that so he owns it.
[03:04:46.506 --> 03:04:47.207]  He's really smart.
[03:04:47.207 --> 03:04:47.607]  We'll be back.
[03:04:48.840 --> 03:04:51.441]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[03:04:51.441 --> 03:04:52.521]  Get back to nature.

[03:05:58.087 --> 03:06:04.572]  One of the most exciting things about HDFirearms.com is the ability to upgrade your AR-15 platform today.
[03:06:04.572 --> 03:06:06.833]  They call it their low-profile platform.

[03:06:11.457 --> 03:06:14.219]  6061 billet material with Type 3 hard coating.

[03:06:47.722 --> 03:06:47.817]  Yeah.
[03:06:48.737 --> 03:06:49.738]  Gold isn't for you?
[03:06:49.738 --> 03:06:55.260]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[03:06:55.260 --> 03:06:55.821]  I get it.
[03:06:55.821 --> 03:07:05.405]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[03:07:05.405 --> 03:07:06.806]  That's not what's happening.
[03:07:06.806 --> 03:07:15.270]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[03:07:15.270 --> 03:07:18.492]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[03:07:18.632 --> 03:07:22.876]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[03:07:22.876 --> 03:07:24.477]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[03:07:24.477 --> 03:07:27.860]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[03:07:27.860 --> 03:07:32.224]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[03:07:32.224 --> 03:07:33.125]  You should, too.
[03:07:33.125 --> 03:07:34.265]  Find out what they know.
[03:07:34.265 --> 03:07:37.588]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.

[03:07:37.949 --> 03:07:38.149]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:07:49.522 --> 03:07:54.926]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:54.926 --> 03:07:57.228]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:13.007 --> 03:08:15.549]  Julia Taransky is our guest.
[03:08:15.549 --> 03:08:21.153]  BraveTheWorld.com is her website and she is, I guess, would you call yourself an anarchist, a libertarian?
[03:08:21.153 --> 03:08:32.441]  An anarchist, and when people ask me what I do, I generally say something like, my only goal is to disenfranchise people from their assumed power structures.
[03:08:32.441 --> 03:08:34.603]  So you're an individualist anarchist, what is that?
[03:08:35.267 --> 03:08:42.813]  That means I don't believe in any centralized authority that works by force ruling us.
[03:08:42.813 --> 03:08:48.096]  That doesn't mean you can't have organization or some sort of cooperation.
[03:08:48.096 --> 03:08:56.142]  That just means that if that exists, you can leave and you can opt out and nobody will hunt you down, make you pay your taxes or, you know, put you in jail.
[03:08:56.142 --> 03:08:57.003]  Absolutely.
[03:08:57.003 --> 03:09:03.368]  And there's a conspiracy by the big foundations to have communists go out and just scum, devil whispers, you name it,
[03:09:04.369 --> 03:09:14.496]  Literally, and wear black, and then they say they're anarchists, but then they have communist tattoos, and they just say they're anarchists, because they don't want to be honest about their communism.
[03:09:14.496 --> 03:09:16.297]  That's the opposite of anarchy.
[03:09:16.297 --> 03:09:22.381]  Yeah, Tights Sue was an anarchist, Leo Tolstoy was an anarchist, Anselm Belger-Gue was an anarchist.
[03:09:22.381 --> 03:09:28.144]  These, you know, 1800s philosophers, there's a whole rich body of work.
[03:09:28.144 --> 03:09:30.306]  And they got taken over by the communists.
[03:09:30.586 --> 03:09:37.131]  Yeah, it's all got compounded and actually there's strands and strands of thought just like any philosophy.
[03:09:37.131 --> 03:09:41.835]  So it's like anything today, it's a word that triggers.
[03:09:41.835 --> 03:09:47.739]  But all that anarchy means is the absence of government.
[03:09:47.739 --> 03:09:51.342]  So they have hammer and sickle flags saying we're anarchists.
[03:09:51.342 --> 03:09:52.923]  That shows how dumb these kids are.
[03:09:53.143 --> 03:09:54.424]  It's insane.
[03:09:54.424 --> 03:09:56.306]  They're reconstructing language, right?
[03:09:56.306 --> 03:09:57.387]  That's what they do.
[03:09:57.387 --> 03:10:01.011]  And when you capture language in society, you capture the people.
[03:10:02.406 --> 03:10:03.387]  And they really are.
[03:10:03.387 --> 03:10:06.109]  Political correctness is a war on language.
[03:10:06.109 --> 03:10:06.730]  It really is.
[03:10:06.730 --> 03:10:08.251]  I had an idea.
[03:10:08.251 --> 03:10:15.317]  I ran by, you know, everyone's saying, oh, keep the keep the Mexican, so put the border, put the put the fences up.
[03:10:15.317 --> 03:10:25.946]  What about putting a giant fence around California and filming them like self cannibalizing there with their PC thoughts and their PC culture?
[03:10:25.946 --> 03:10:28.929]  And just make it a giant running man meets a reality.
[03:10:29.409 --> 03:10:33.391]  TV show and wall the Californians in to kill each other.
[03:10:33.391 --> 03:10:33.992]  Wall them in.
[03:10:33.992 --> 03:10:35.252]  We don't want them anywhere here.
[03:10:35.252 --> 03:10:39.595]  They're all moving to Austin because of the regulations happening in California.
[03:10:39.595 --> 03:10:41.576]  And then they want to put the same regulations here.
[03:10:41.576 --> 03:10:42.737]  And they poison the land.
[03:10:42.737 --> 03:10:44.038]  They want public pooping, all of the stuff.
[03:10:45.339 --> 03:10:47.240]  Keep the Californians in.
[03:10:47.240 --> 03:10:50.143]  I think that would solve more problems than keeping the Mexicans in.
[03:10:50.143 --> 03:10:53.145]  I think that should be the new California flag as a homeless guy cramping.
[03:10:53.145 --> 03:10:54.026]  I think so.
[03:10:54.026 --> 03:10:55.367]  I'm sorry.
[03:10:55.367 --> 03:10:56.147]  I've seen this.
[03:10:56.147 --> 03:10:58.769]  I was there for only a month and I've witnessed that.
[03:10:58.769 --> 03:11:00.251]  It's terrible.
[03:11:00.251 --> 03:11:02.772]  And it's again the direct result of government intervention.
[03:11:02.772 --> 03:11:04.053]  Why are you being hateful?
[03:11:04.053 --> 03:11:05.254]  That's discriminatory.
[03:11:05.254 --> 03:11:06.395]  I'm white so I can't help it.
[03:11:06.395 --> 03:11:07.396]  That's part of the culture.
[03:11:07.396 --> 03:11:12.220]  I am white privileged, you know, like how my family died in communist Russia, but I have privilege.
[03:11:13.456 --> 03:11:15.497]  Well, you're responsible for slavery.
[03:11:15.497 --> 03:11:16.298]  Of course.
[03:11:16.298 --> 03:11:17.899]  You know, that was one thing about Ferguson and St.
[03:11:17.899 --> 03:11:18.239]  Louis.
[03:11:18.239 --> 03:11:33.067]  A bunch of Eastern European immigrants got killed because they're poor, they're moving into poorer areas, and racist black groups beat them to death with hammers, shoot them, and they'll say, well, they're white, as if Eastern Europeans had anything to do with Africa, transatlantic slavery.
[03:11:33.067 --> 03:11:34.188]  It's just so stupid.
[03:11:34.528 --> 03:11:35.749]  It's totally insane.
[03:11:35.749 --> 03:11:37.569]  It's totally insane.
[03:11:37.569 --> 03:11:43.452]  And again, it goes back to no one, you know, it's another contradiction of the progressive mind.
[03:11:43.452 --> 03:11:52.856]  Because if you're white, you're responsible for your people's history, but you're not responsible for yourself as an individual, so you can't have a gun.
[03:11:52.856 --> 03:11:54.517]  I mean, it doesn't make any sense.
[03:11:54.517 --> 03:11:58.838]  Or airline pilots that could crash the whole plane and kill tens of thousands, they
[03:12:00.279 --> 03:12:01.700]  Can't have a gun in the cockpit.
[03:12:01.700 --> 03:12:02.280]  Or cars.
[03:12:02.280 --> 03:12:11.787]  I mean, cars are like this libertarian, utopian success of human intellect and individualism.
[03:12:11.787 --> 03:12:14.269]  People generally drive cars safely.
[03:12:14.269 --> 03:12:19.653]  You're wielding a machine of tons of force that could kill anybody if you choose to.
[03:12:19.653 --> 03:12:23.435]  But we let people get a license over the weekend and drive a car.
[03:12:23.435 --> 03:12:24.836]  I mean, that's insane.
[03:12:24.836 --> 03:12:26.117]  We should ban the cars.
[03:12:26.117 --> 03:12:27.538]  You can kill a whole family.
[03:12:27.538 --> 03:12:28.419]  And that's where they're going.
[03:12:28.619 --> 03:12:32.221]  That's where they're going with turning it all into a present.
[03:12:32.221 --> 03:12:35.922]  And people ask, well, how's the insurance companies going to make money when it's driverless cars?
[03:12:35.922 --> 03:12:40.644]  The long phase-out, they're going to double and triple charge people that don't drive driverless cars.
[03:12:40.644 --> 03:12:46.706]  They're going to phase in the driverless cars with Mercedes, Audi, and others that have them where they automatically start slowing down.
[03:12:46.706 --> 03:12:48.387]  You think you're going to hit somebody.
[03:12:48.387 --> 03:12:52.769]  And sure, that's probably good in and of itself, except it's AI.
[03:12:52.769 --> 03:12:55.330]  It's taking control, just like calculators.
[03:12:56.090 --> 03:13:03.296]  In 30 years from Texas Instruments have made us going from being good with arithmetic in our heads to not even knowing how to do it.
[03:13:03.296 --> 03:13:04.597]  Or spell checkers.
[03:13:04.597 --> 03:13:08.621]  This stuff has a side effect of dumbing us down.
[03:13:08.621 --> 03:13:16.287]  We should make the conscious decision to not go in this direction and develop technological applications and use
[03:13:17.228 --> 03:13:18.629]  That empowers humanity.
[03:13:18.629 --> 03:13:20.111]  There should at least be a debate about it.
[03:13:20.111 --> 03:13:22.032]  And there's a lot of things that do do that.
[03:13:22.032 --> 03:13:26.496]  And again, being an individualist anarchist goes back to taking responsibility.
[03:13:26.496 --> 03:13:29.158]  So, as a woman, I own a gun.
[03:13:29.158 --> 03:13:32.101]  Because that is... As a purple penguin.
[03:13:32.101 --> 03:13:33.782]  The word woman might hurt somebody's feelings.
[03:13:33.902 --> 03:13:40.244]  Oh yeah, soon natural birth will be illegal because transgender people can't give natural birth.
[03:13:40.244 --> 03:13:41.104]  And by the way, don't joke.
[03:13:41.104 --> 03:13:42.305]  They're actually talking about that.
[03:13:42.305 --> 03:13:43.425]  Now say I'm a purple penguin.
[03:13:43.425 --> 03:13:44.405]  I'm not joking.
[03:13:44.405 --> 03:13:45.166]  Say I'm a purple penguin.
[03:13:45.166 --> 03:13:49.587]  I'm a purple penguin who owns a gun and I think all women should own guns.
[03:13:49.587 --> 03:13:50.327]  Oh, sorry.
[03:13:50.327 --> 03:13:52.408]  All purple penguins should own guns.
[03:13:52.408 --> 03:13:57.590]  And I think there's a clip that you guys can show and I've really summarized why quite well.
[03:13:57.590 --> 03:13:59.590]  Let's go to this purple penguin clip.
[03:13:59.590 --> 03:14:01.051]  This is a purple penguin with a gun.
[03:14:01.831 --> 03:14:05.034]  Women's rights and gun rights are congruent.
[03:14:05.034 --> 03:14:08.677]  Most females are physiologically smaller than most males.
[03:14:08.677 --> 03:14:13.782]  This puts women at a great disadvantage in a life-threatening situation against a man.
[03:14:13.782 --> 03:14:15.483]  A gun is an equalizer.
[03:14:15.483 --> 03:14:18.366]  Without it, the equality between sexes is a joke.
[03:14:19.531 --> 03:14:28.336]  But wait a minute, to even say that women on average aren't as strong as men is sexist and is part of the hierarchy of male oppression that you're defending and helping.
[03:14:28.336 --> 03:14:31.157]  I've never heard such thought crime.
[03:14:31.157 --> 03:14:31.698]  It's crazy.
[03:14:31.698 --> 03:14:32.818]  Are you saying I can't have a baby?
[03:14:32.818 --> 03:14:37.781]  Because you're claiming I'm not as equal to you in a reproductive way.
[03:14:37.781 --> 03:14:39.482]  That's sexist as well.
[03:14:39.482 --> 03:14:40.423]  I'm a purple penguin.
[03:14:40.423 --> 03:14:41.223]  I can lay eggs.
[03:14:41.423 --> 03:14:45.065]  I think the Olympics shouldn't be broken up into sexes anymore.
[03:14:45.065 --> 03:14:53.790]  We should all have the Olympics as one gender, and if women can't keep up and compete with the men, then that's sexist, and they should be executed.
[03:14:53.790 --> 03:14:57.813]  Well, actually, you should give the men hormones to turn them into women.
[03:14:57.813 --> 03:14:58.153]  Oh, yeah.
[03:14:58.153 --> 03:14:59.294]  Well, we're already doing that.
[03:14:59.294 --> 03:15:02.756]  All the estrogen from the birth control pill, you're drinking that every day.
[03:15:02.756 --> 03:15:03.476]  No big deal.
[03:15:03.476 --> 03:15:05.537]  Let's not worry about the social engineering, though.
[03:15:05.537 --> 03:15:08.159]  Let's just worship Rachel Maddow.
[03:15:09.338 --> 03:15:10.339]  Is she even a woman?
[03:15:10.339 --> 03:15:18.425]  I'm going to be honest, I'm actually gay and I'm dating a man named Rachel Maddow.
[03:15:18.425 --> 03:15:20.446]  This is never going to end, this joke.
[03:15:20.446 --> 03:15:21.447]  Oh my gosh.
[03:15:21.447 --> 03:15:23.729]  They're going to take that out of context and loop it.
[03:15:23.729 --> 03:15:24.169]  No, seriously.
[03:15:24.169 --> 03:15:24.890]  I have a picture.
[03:15:26.581 --> 03:15:27.902]  It's true.
[03:15:27.902 --> 03:15:30.364]  Well, I'm dating Rachel Maddow.
[03:15:30.364 --> 03:15:31.045]  She's a man.
[03:15:31.045 --> 03:15:34.187]  And if they attack that on there, give me a break.
[03:15:34.187 --> 03:15:35.448]  It's humor.
[03:15:35.448 --> 03:15:37.610]  Well, she's a public figure.
[03:15:37.610 --> 03:15:39.191]  She should anticipate.
[03:15:39.191 --> 03:15:40.512]  I'm going to be honest, Rachel.
[03:15:40.512 --> 03:15:43.414]  I want to date you.
[03:15:43.414 --> 03:15:45.076]  Well, they say tastes change as you get older.
[03:15:45.076 --> 03:15:48.498]  And I mean, I think, I think he's a good looking stud.
[03:15:48.498 --> 03:15:51.681]  She has nice suits.
[03:15:51.681 --> 03:15:54.643]  I mean, look, admit that she's a good looking guy.
[03:15:54.643 --> 03:15:55.544]  I admit it.
[03:15:56.320 --> 03:16:00.281]  You know, she is the only... I can't watch her because I get a bit, you know, hot.
[03:16:00.281 --> 03:16:01.361]  So I have to leave the room.
[03:16:01.361 --> 03:16:01.881]  Really?
[03:16:01.881 --> 03:16:03.201]  You're attracted to Mr. Mano?
[03:16:03.201 --> 03:16:03.782]  Oh my god.
[03:16:03.782 --> 03:16:05.762]  We're gonna have to compete.
[03:16:05.762 --> 03:16:07.242]  You are actually attracted to him too?
[03:16:07.242 --> 03:16:07.722]  Yeah.
[03:16:07.722 --> 03:16:09.003]  He's taking me out for steaks later.
[03:16:09.003 --> 03:16:13.024]  Uh oh.
[03:16:13.024 --> 03:16:15.644]  Oh my gosh.
[03:16:15.644 --> 03:16:16.804]  We gotta get serious here.
[03:16:16.804 --> 03:16:19.425]  Okay, let's get serious with Bill and then Neil.
[03:16:19.425 --> 03:16:22.165]  Bill is calling from Tennessee.
[03:16:22.165 --> 03:16:24.266]  Alex Jones predictions not happening.
[03:16:24.266 --> 03:16:24.546]  Go ahead.
[03:16:25.768 --> 03:16:26.749]  Afternoon.
[03:16:26.749 --> 03:16:34.476]  Um, I've listened to you off and on for a couple of years now, and so far, I mean, let's see, um, where are the FEMA camps, Alex?
[03:16:34.476 --> 03:16:36.517]  Who's gunning for your guns, Alex?
[03:16:36.517 --> 03:16:38.159]  Jade Helm, you've hyped that.
[03:16:38.159 --> 03:16:39.860]  Nothing happened.
[03:16:39.860 --> 03:16:43.083]  I'm sorry, I mean, you just consistently fearmonger and fail us.
[03:16:43.083 --> 03:16:46.366]  And, and, no, Bilderberg, nothing happens.
[03:16:46.366 --> 03:16:49.129]  You're, you're a continuous failure, and nothing ever happens.
[03:16:49.129 --> 03:16:51.471]  And before you say you're trying to stop it, that's just the easy way out.
[03:16:54.716 --> 03:16:59.499]  Are you a joke caller trying to make me look good, or are you serious?
[03:16:59.499 --> 03:17:01.380]  I'm serious.
[03:17:01.380 --> 03:17:04.682]  Well, we never said... Let me talk.
[03:17:04.682 --> 03:17:05.382]  You made some statements.
[03:17:05.382 --> 03:17:06.903]  Just excuse me for a moment.
[03:17:06.903 --> 03:17:09.464]  You said... I'm going to skip this network break coming up.
[03:17:09.464 --> 03:17:10.065]  You said...
[03:17:11.089 --> 03:17:15.312]  That I was saying Jade Helm is going to be a takeover, or you imply that.
[03:17:15.312 --> 03:17:15.972]  I never said that.
[03:17:15.972 --> 03:17:20.075]  That's a construct of my boyfriend, Mr. Maddow.
[03:17:20.075 --> 03:17:24.998]  You expand upon that with a bunch of other statements about where's the FEMA camps.
[03:17:24.998 --> 03:17:40.228]  Since I first started exposing emergency centers in the mid 90s, when we were confirmed it through classified sources about the re-education camps under the different programs, like a civilian inmate labor camp program that was declassified in 99.
[03:17:42.490 --> 03:17:55.175]  Now they have released the Army manuals for the emergency centers establishment system where it admits the plans under emergency to round up political dissidents and put us basically in forced labor camps.
[03:17:55.175 --> 03:17:56.756]  You can read that at army.mil.
[03:17:56.756 --> 03:17:58.317]  We wrote articles about it, linked.
[03:17:58.857 --> 03:18:01.058]  We're trying to fight them getting the guns.
[03:18:01.058 --> 03:18:04.760]  They've taken the guns everywhere else in the world but a handful of nations.
[03:18:04.760 --> 03:18:06.661]  They admit they want our guns.
[03:18:06.661 --> 03:18:10.783]  They're talking about taking the guns away from social security recipients now.
[03:18:10.783 --> 03:18:12.785]  That's mainstream news.
[03:18:12.785 --> 03:18:14.806]  The borders are wide open outside of law.
[03:18:14.806 --> 03:18:17.327]  They're shutting off power plants outside of law.
[03:18:17.327 --> 03:18:20.729]  They're signing us on to trillions in derivatives outside of law.
[03:18:20.729 --> 03:18:22.130]  They're delivering armored vehicles.
[03:18:22.130 --> 03:18:25.291]  A local department saying it's for the veterans and gun owners.
[03:18:25.291 --> 03:18:27.953]  And I mean, look, we've stalemated the enemy.
[03:18:30.356 --> 03:18:30.436]  95%.
[03:18:30.436 --> 03:18:34.717]  They're kind of still winning in a few places, but we're in a death battle.
[03:18:34.717 --> 03:18:40.080]  And they've done mass confiscation, illegal confiscation of guns in Canada as well.
[03:18:40.080 --> 03:18:49.824]  Absolutely, but this guy calls in and says nothing's happening and laughs in a satisfied way like I've been proven wrong.
[03:18:49.824 --> 03:18:53.426]  I mean, it's like declaring that Mark Twain was dead when he wasn't.
[03:18:53.426 --> 03:18:54.806]  I mean, you're a joke, Bill.
[03:18:54.806 --> 03:18:55.727]  I mean, are you for real?
[03:18:56.877 --> 03:18:57.537]  Are you for real?
[03:18:57.537 --> 03:19:01.620]  Who can deny we're descending into tyranny?
[03:19:01.620 --> 03:19:03.300]  Descending into tyranny?
[03:19:03.300 --> 03:19:05.061]  Yeah Alex, everywhere is tyranny.
[03:19:05.061 --> 03:19:06.462]  Look behind you is tyranny.
[03:19:06.462 --> 03:19:08.703]  Again, FEMA camps.
[03:19:08.703 --> 03:19:10.304]  Where are they Alex?
[03:19:10.304 --> 03:19:11.945]  Who's been put in FEMA camps Alex?
[03:19:13.676 --> 03:19:15.158]  You say you've been listening for years.
[03:19:15.158 --> 03:19:28.511]  You can type in reeducationcampsmanualinfowars.com and then you can link through to army.mil and read it and then you can read mainstream news articles that came out a month after confirming our report.
[03:19:28.511 --> 03:19:34.997]  We broke the secret documents from the FBI, State Police, Federal Marshals seven years ago.
[03:19:36.437 --> 03:19:40.720]  About the plan to put and demonize and go after patriots.
[03:19:40.720 --> 03:19:42.661]  And people still say that's fake.
[03:19:42.661 --> 03:19:45.323]  I mean, the truth is, we're not lying here.
[03:19:45.323 --> 03:19:48.545]  You're hoping people don't go look up these army manuals.
[03:19:48.545 --> 03:19:51.887]  You're just targeting people you think are stupid.
[03:19:51.887 --> 03:19:53.228]  Let me give you the field manual.
[03:19:53.228 --> 03:19:55.289]  Let me just give you one of the field manuals.
[03:19:55.289 --> 03:19:56.110]  Okay, FM3-39.40.
[03:19:56.110 --> 03:19:57.531]  Are you able to write stuff down?
[03:20:01.195 --> 03:20:02.836]  Shut up!
[03:20:02.836 --> 03:20:04.217]  Shut up and answer my questions!
[03:20:04.217 --> 03:20:07.618]  I'm going to put up, because this is serious stuff, okay?
[03:20:07.618 --> 03:20:09.099]  Don't act like a weasel punk.
[03:20:09.099 --> 03:20:12.821]  Put it back on screen for me, please.
[03:20:12.821 --> 03:20:18.804]  FM3-39.40, Interment Resettlement Operations, February 2010, leaked in 2012.
[03:20:18.804 --> 03:20:25.247]  The Army first denied it, then confirmed it two weeks later, and said that we shouldn't have it.
[03:20:25.247 --> 03:20:27.028]  It was covered by major newspapers.
[03:20:27.028 --> 03:20:28.309]  Are you saying that isn't real?
[03:20:29.961 --> 03:20:32.421]  Every time you have something like that, I research it.
[03:20:32.421 --> 03:20:38.903]  You take a small bit of truth, a small bit of information, and turn it into a huge thing, and it usually ends up being wrong.
[03:20:38.903 --> 03:20:40.443]  That is total bull.
[03:20:40.443 --> 03:20:45.804]  Just like Planned Parenthood said, none of the videos were real, then they were edited, then they weren't selling the body parts.
[03:20:45.804 --> 03:20:50.085]  Oh, the Planned Parenthood isn't selling the baby parts?
[03:20:50.085 --> 03:20:53.925]  If you're talking about research, then yes, they do.
[03:20:53.925 --> 03:20:57.406]  Let me ask you this, why would they sell body parts?
[03:20:57.406 --> 03:20:58.226]  Because they make money?
[03:21:00.265 --> 03:21:02.448]  Uh, no, they don't sell body parts.
[03:21:02.448 --> 03:21:06.514]  They research, research, insurance, they pay for storage and transportation, sure.
[03:21:06.514 --> 03:21:09.919]  Bill, are you a social worker?
[03:21:09.919 --> 03:21:11.141]  That's irrelevant, Alex.
[03:21:11.141 --> 03:21:11.842]  That's my question.
[03:21:11.842 --> 03:21:12.623]  Why would they sell body parts?
[03:21:12.623 --> 03:21:14.145]  I'm going to ask you one more time.
[03:21:14.145 --> 03:21:15.087]  Are you a social worker?
[03:21:15.899 --> 03:21:16.679]  That's irrelevant.
[03:21:16.679 --> 03:21:18.200]  That's irrelevant, Alex.
[03:21:18.200 --> 03:21:18.841]  That's irrelevant.
[03:21:38.652 --> 03:21:39.513]  That's irrelevant, Alex.
[03:21:39.513 --> 03:21:40.434]  It's not irrelevant.
[03:21:40.434 --> 03:21:41.054]  You know what Alex does.
[03:21:41.054 --> 03:21:44.337]  Hey, let's just see if I'm right with my little hunch here.
[03:21:44.337 --> 03:21:50.603]  Tell me right now, Mr. Big Brain, are you or have you ever been a social worker?
[03:21:50.603 --> 03:21:52.344]  Nope.
[03:21:52.344 --> 03:21:54.746]  So you're not a government worker?
[03:21:54.746 --> 03:21:56.208]  Nope.
[03:21:56.208 --> 03:21:56.708]  I'm interested.
[03:21:56.708 --> 03:21:59.030]  What is your profession?
[03:21:59.030 --> 03:22:00.912]  Why is that relevant?
[03:22:00.912 --> 03:22:02.814]  Because I just wonder how stupid you can be.
[03:22:05.279 --> 03:22:16.807]  That's a lie to target new listeners, people listening on WBCR, to then think we're not telling the truth.
[03:22:16.807 --> 03:22:25.494]  No, we put up the full manual that talks about processing people with their social security numbers and families, and I've got footage myself shot
[03:22:25.914 --> 03:22:27.135]  Are you referring to training exercises they do?
[03:22:27.135 --> 03:22:34.378]  Yeah, if they're training to take on veterans and gun owners and they say the armored vehicles are for us, what does that mean, jackass?
[03:22:50.763 --> 03:22:56.250]  I'll quote Satoshi Nakamoto who invented Bitcoin and he said, if you don't get it, I don't have time for you.
[03:22:56.250 --> 03:22:56.650]  That's it.
[03:23:11.773 --> 03:23:13.977]  I mean, I think that guy was for real.
[03:23:13.977 --> 03:23:14.718]  Oh, of course.
[03:23:14.718 --> 03:23:18.785]  I mean, there's loads of people who feel that way, and it's a defense mechanism.
[03:23:18.785 --> 03:23:20.708]  And, I mean, people don't have to...
[03:23:23.373 --> 03:23:27.395]  No, they used to tell me that there was no such thing as the NSA 20 years ago.
[03:23:27.395 --> 03:23:28.456]  No such thing as Echelon.
[03:23:28.456 --> 03:23:33.919]  I'd have major whistleblowers on and people would say, that wasn't the former producer of Nightline.
[03:23:33.919 --> 03:23:36.480]  That wasn't the former NSA officer.
[03:23:36.480 --> 03:23:38.301]  And you don't have to believe everything.
[03:23:38.301 --> 03:23:39.702]  But now it's all out in the open!
[03:23:39.702 --> 03:23:40.502]  Proven right again!
[03:23:40.502 --> 03:23:41.443]  Proven right again!
[03:23:42.043 --> 03:23:54.853]  You don't have to believe everything that anybody says, but there must be... If you don't understand that there's something deeply wrong with most things that we are told, then you are living in a fog of your own illusion.
[03:23:54.853 --> 03:23:55.394]  Okay?
[03:23:55.394 --> 03:23:55.574]  Sure.
[03:23:55.574 --> 03:23:57.135]  Well, I mean, I don't need to call him names.
[03:23:57.135 --> 03:23:59.417]  I mean, I'm intellectual enough to come up with terms for it.
[03:23:59.417 --> 03:24:04.101]  But when somebody acts like a baby and just puts out this info, he is a jackass.
[03:24:04.101 --> 03:24:07.384]  I still think he's a social worker just from the way he was speaking.
[03:24:07.384 --> 03:24:07.644]  Oh, I'm...
[03:24:08.144 --> 03:24:11.947]  That's why he didn't answer the question, because you don't want to say yes, you'd rather say no.
[03:24:11.947 --> 03:24:15.610]  Yeah, I think he was lying, I think he's a social worker.
[03:24:15.610 --> 03:24:26.119]  I've just learned the self-satisfied, and they're not all like that, some of them are nice, but I've run into that, I've just learned the little self-satisfied thing, like they're in control, they talk real soft to you, like you're a joke, it's all condescension.
[03:24:26.119 --> 03:24:27.580]  You know, whatever, buddy.
[03:24:27.580 --> 03:24:33.946]  You don't control reality, and I'll say boy or girl, father, mother, husband, wife, I'll never say purple penguin.
[03:24:34.451 --> 03:24:36.933]  Yeah, well there's something deeply wrong.
[03:24:36.933 --> 03:24:40.137]  They want to control everything like cult leaders!
[03:24:40.137 --> 03:24:43.820]  There's a man... Because they're building a giant crap hole!
[03:24:43.820 --> 03:24:53.509]  You people produce, you know what, and we're sick of you, we don't want to be led by you, we don't like you, we don't like your labels, go to hell!
[03:24:53.509 --> 03:24:54.330]  Sorry.
[03:24:54.330 --> 03:24:54.691]  Go ahead.
[03:24:55.291 --> 03:25:12.606]  When America's throwing people like Ross Ulbrich in jail for starting a website and giving him a harsher sentence than people who have killed multiple people or raped multiple people, we know that there's an agenda of oppression and control in America and the government is scared of independent thought.
[03:25:12.606 --> 03:25:15.629]  Look at how Canada extradites people that say the Holocaust didn't happen.
[03:25:15.629 --> 03:25:22.395]  Now, I may not agree with what they're saying, but the point is these people get put in solitary confinement for decades in Germany
[03:25:23.689 --> 03:25:30.975]  Aren't Zundel and people, because someone said something political that Canada didn't agree with, that's a tyranny!
[03:25:30.975 --> 03:25:31.555]  Yep.
[03:25:31.555 --> 03:25:40.722]  And the interesting thing is Israel themselves denied the Holocaust for the first few years after it occurred because they were embarrassed.
[03:25:40.722 --> 03:25:46.567]  So there was a whole portion of Jews who just denied that it ever happened.
[03:25:46.567 --> 03:25:48.729]  And nobody was prosecuted for that.
[03:25:48.729 --> 03:25:51.791]  I mean, this is, we still have to adhere to, even if you want to hear it.
[03:25:51.791 --> 03:25:52.812]  Well, once they set the precedent,
[03:25:52.912 --> 03:26:00.156]  That they can arrest you for saying the Holocaust didn't happen, for saying 5,999,000 died, then they can start arresting you for everything!
[03:26:00.156 --> 03:26:01.176]  Free speech is dead!
[03:26:01.176 --> 03:26:02.417]  Free speech is dead!
[03:26:02.417 --> 03:26:03.177]  You don't say that?
[03:26:03.177 --> 03:26:03.978]  Yeah, it's terrible.
[03:26:03.978 --> 03:26:05.078]  It's dead in Canada.
[03:26:05.078 --> 03:26:06.159]  It's happening.
[03:26:06.159 --> 03:26:14.523]  You guys still have the Constitution and the Bill of Rights protecting you in some cases, but it's being degregated to a huge extent.
[03:26:14.523 --> 03:26:16.124]  Hey, you want to host the next segment?
[03:26:16.124 --> 03:26:20.126]  I've got to go to a business meeting, but you're leaving back to Toronto tomorrow.
[03:26:20.546 --> 03:26:24.709]  You can come in in the next segment and actually take these phone calls.
[03:26:24.709 --> 03:26:26.290]  Yeah, I'll just take phone calls.
[03:26:26.290 --> 03:26:28.331]  And then Cover News is an 18-minute segment.
[03:26:28.331 --> 03:26:30.853]  But right now, let's go to Neil in Ohio.
[03:26:30.853 --> 03:26:31.874]  Neil, you're on the air.
[03:26:31.874 --> 03:26:33.435]  Or, I'm sorry, that's a male name.
[03:26:33.435 --> 03:26:35.596]  Purple Penguin in Ohio, you're on the air.
[03:26:35.596 --> 03:26:37.918]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[03:26:37.918 --> 03:26:38.378]  It's an honor.
[03:26:39.534 --> 03:26:57.526]  Hey, you mentioned earlier that for us to get the information out before anything kicks off and I just wanted to remind your listeners that when these shooting events happen that we need to be taking notes to catch changing stories like in Aurora and Sandy Hook.
[03:26:57.526 --> 03:27:05.591]  And also today I was been watching the news of this shooting of this Flanagan character and they're making a big deal about how he had a social media account.
[03:27:05.591 --> 03:27:07.192]  I just was wondering your thoughts on
[03:27:08.178 --> 03:27:14.787]  Obviously this is going to impact the gun control push, but do you think it could open the door for some sort of social media background checks?
[03:27:14.787 --> 03:27:20.214]  I mean, Obama did just say, ignore ideologies that run counter to where we need to go.
[03:27:20.214 --> 03:27:25.461]  Sure, they're going to use this for cyber security as well, but really it's a Black Lives Matter
[03:27:26.943 --> 03:27:35.270]  Looks like a mentally ill person, similar to the guy that shot up the black people there in Charleston, so I think it's the same thing.
[03:27:35.270 --> 03:27:43.117]  It's just all part of the media making our problems about somebody's skin color as a diversion from the big mega banks screwing us over.
[03:27:43.117 --> 03:27:45.038]  Neal, thank you so much for the call.
[03:27:45.038 --> 03:27:46.680]  Denise in Illinois, thanks for holding.
[03:27:46.680 --> 03:27:47.220]  You're on the air.
[03:27:47.220 --> 03:27:50.523]  Hi, thanks for taking my call.
[03:27:50.523 --> 03:27:53.666]  I wanted to agree with you strongly about these
[03:27:54.985 --> 03:28:01.930]  Antidepressants, psychotropic drugs, I was prescribed them in the late 90s to control chronic pain.
[03:28:01.930 --> 03:28:04.712]  I didn't have depression, history of it.
[03:28:04.712 --> 03:28:08.035]  They're pushing it on people that have car wrecks now.
[03:28:08.035 --> 03:28:10.837]  And I wound up overdosing on those pills.
[03:28:10.837 --> 03:28:12.438]  So then they put me on a different one.
[03:28:12.438 --> 03:28:13.078]  Same thing.
[03:28:13.078 --> 03:28:17.001]  I won't touch those with a 10-foot pole.
[03:28:17.001 --> 03:28:18.142]  What was the experience like?
[03:28:20.154 --> 03:28:21.556]  It was horrible.
[03:28:21.556 --> 03:28:30.965]  I finally was able to, you know, I fired my doctor basically and I saw another doctor and he said, you know, it's the pills.
[03:28:30.965 --> 03:28:32.107]  Just don't take the pills.
[03:28:32.107 --> 03:28:33.088]  I said, you know what?
[03:28:33.088 --> 03:28:35.931]  So I went against medical advice.
[03:28:35.931 --> 03:28:37.092]  I still have chronic pain.
[03:28:37.874 --> 03:28:39.575]  I'm able to deal with it.
[03:28:39.575 --> 03:28:41.477]  Some days I have to lay down and whatnot.
[03:28:41.477 --> 03:28:46.520]  I'd rather have the pain and have my brain and be able to think clearly.
[03:28:46.520 --> 03:28:48.241]  God bless you ma'am for that testimony.
[03:28:48.241 --> 03:28:49.922]  We gotta jump.
[03:28:49.922 --> 03:28:57.528]  Joe Biggs, this even came out in the news, they would order combat troops to just take painkillers to get them addicted and then they would fly in masses of it.
[03:28:58.268 --> 03:29:02.910]  And then afterwards, they would try to use that to take their rights away and things once they got out of the military.
[03:29:02.910 --> 03:29:06.252]  I mean, this is all part of setting people up, controlling people.
[03:29:06.252 --> 03:29:07.813]  It's social engineering.
[03:29:07.813 --> 03:29:09.633]  People should just be aware of it.
[03:29:09.633 --> 03:29:17.617]  Well, BraveTheWorld.com, Julia, stay there, because there's an 18-minute segment coming up, and if that goes well, you can do the last segment in six minutes.
[03:29:17.617 --> 03:29:19.358]  So you've got the next 30 minutes here on air.
[03:29:19.358 --> 03:29:22.159]  I often do this with a guest that joins us in the fourth hour.
[03:29:22.159 --> 03:29:23.560]  I just walk off and leave you in there.
[03:29:24.480 --> 03:29:27.421]  In the TV studio, so that's coming up.
[03:29:27.421 --> 03:29:28.901]  I'm sorry for those that died today.
[03:29:28.901 --> 03:29:34.123]  I'm sorry for the hundreds of thousands killed by Hillary Clinton's ISIS people too.
[03:29:34.123 --> 03:29:35.723]  Thank you so much for coming into town.
[03:29:35.723 --> 03:29:37.043]  Good to meet you in person.

[03:31:39.181 --> 03:31:52.246]  Friends, this is Alex Jones for MidasResources.com.
[03:31:52.246 --> 03:31:57.828]  For more than 15 years, I have exclusively used Midas Resources for all my precious metal needs.
[03:31:57.828 --> 03:32:03.450]  Whether it's bullion or collectibles you're looking for, Midas Resources is simply the best.
[03:32:03.450 --> 03:32:05.511]  I own my gold as a hedge against inflation.
[03:32:06.051 --> 03:32:12.376]  This Federal Reserve fiat currency could go the way of the Deutsche Mark and the Weimar Republic anytime.
[03:32:12.376 --> 03:32:17.260]  In these historically dangerous times, it makes sense to physically hold gold and silver.
[03:32:17.260 --> 03:32:20.143]  Midas already has some of the best deals in the industry.
[03:32:20.143 --> 03:32:25.707]  But if you give them a call and mention the radio special, they will give you a list of the day's super specials.
[03:32:25.707 --> 03:32:29.050]  Midas brokers are standing by to answer all your questions at 800-686-2237.
[03:32:31.912 --> 03:32:38.354]  They also have a lot of informative free literature explaining the opportunities and risk of holding precious metals.
[03:32:38.354 --> 03:32:43.556]  They are ready to answer your questions at 800-686-2237.
[03:32:43.556 --> 03:32:50.938]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[03:32:50.938 --> 03:32:57.580]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:32:57.580 --> 03:33:00.561]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:07.529 --> 03:33:10.111]  Hi there, I'm filling in for Alex Jones.
[03:33:10.111 --> 03:33:35.746]  My name is Julia Tvansky of Brave the World, and we're going to take some calls, but first I want to plug a little local event happening in Austin, Texas, and it's happening at the Draft House on Lamar Street, and we are doing a screening of the Deep Web Movie, which is the coverage of the Ross Ulbrich trial and the issues of free speech in America.
[03:33:36.566 --> 03:33:36.887]  I'm good.
[03:33:53.687 --> 03:34:01.289]  So, we'll be doing a live broadcast from 8 o'clock to maybe midnight and the movie starts at 7 p.m.
[03:34:01.289 --> 03:34:18.212]  and all proceeds go to Lynn Ulbrich who was a previous guest on the Alex Jones Show and to help bring about the appeal of her son who committed a non-violent crime and basically starting a website where free trade was facilitated.
[03:34:19.112 --> 03:34:24.857]  So, come out and support us and watch a great movie and meet the director at the Drafthouse tonight at 7pm.
[03:34:24.857 --> 03:34:28.700]  So, we're going to do a caller.
[03:34:28.700 --> 03:34:32.363]  Maybe let's take Brent from Texas.
[03:34:32.363 --> 03:34:34.224]  Hi Brent, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:34:34.224 --> 03:34:37.406]  Hi, thank you for taking my call.
[03:34:37.406 --> 03:34:45.733]  I was actually hoping to get in after the joke caller or the somewhat serious caller they called earlier regarding
[03:34:46.397 --> 03:34:49.699]  Stating no things had happened that Alex had predicted.
[03:34:49.699 --> 03:35:05.228]  Now, you know, he says there's no FEMA camps, but it wasn't, you know, but two or three weeks ago we were reading articles about how there were secret detention facilities in Detroit where people were being held without trial for indefinite periods of time.
[03:35:05.228 --> 03:35:09.651]  Now, you can call it a FEMA camp, call it tomato, it doesn't really matter now.
[03:35:11.112 --> 03:35:32.406]  Regarding the FM3-39 document, if you read in that document, it states that people will be processed by their social security numbers and that the prisoners, or I guess the citizens is what we would call them, are not going to be eligible to become any kind of trustee or have any job inside the prison.
[03:35:32.406 --> 03:35:38.950]  So basically, if you're a citizen, you'll have no kind of say-so in these detention camps.
[03:35:39.452 --> 03:35:43.613]  And if I may, I'd like to say one more thing, the original reason why I called in.
[03:35:43.613 --> 03:35:44.554]  Yeah, go ahead, of course.
[03:35:44.554 --> 03:35:46.934]  All right, thank you.
[03:35:46.934 --> 03:36:02.079]  Around April the 20th, I had called into the Alex Jones Show, and I had ran across information that said Jade Helms stood for the Joint Assistant for Deployment and Execution Homeland Eradication of Local Militias.
[03:36:02.079 --> 03:36:04.840]  Now, when I called in and said that, you know, David Knight,
[03:36:05.579 --> 03:36:08.322]  Uh, was the person taking calls at the time.
[03:36:08.322 --> 03:36:17.450]  He actually chastised me a bit stating, you know, that we need hard evidence with claims such as these, which is totally understandable.
[03:36:17.450 --> 03:36:23.615]  But since that time, I've heard callers call in stating that Alex Jones has said this himself.
[03:36:23.615 --> 03:36:25.737]  Now, that is totally not true.
[03:36:25.737 --> 03:36:30.361]  And the only thing that I've heard Alex Jones mention on this, I believe it was around April 23rd or 24th,
[03:36:32.307 --> 03:36:43.812]  He stated there was a man that used to have a radio station or a radio program in Austin named Sergeant Sam or something along those lines that he had got that information from.
[03:36:43.812 --> 03:36:51.196]  But at no point in time did Alex say this was his information that he had got or that it was set in stone.
[03:36:51.196 --> 03:37:00.040]  So this is just, once again, people trying to play words off of each other to fit their agenda instead of looking at the actual picture and seeing the truth in things.
[03:37:00.507 --> 03:37:09.249]  Right, and we have this kind of mentality where we run a narrative in our own minds and it's like a stage play.
[03:37:09.249 --> 03:37:18.332]  You have a character that you've been programmed to play and you do it because your overlords are watching and they reward you when you play your role properly.
[03:37:18.912 --> 03:37:39.378]  And what is this hypocrisy about, you know, I understand the full legitimate proof, but the government is all about preventative action and they don't have full legitimate proof of a lot of things that they claim to be protecting us against, yet they get to do the preemptive and the preventative systematic action against us to protect us.
[03:37:39.998 --> 03:37:42.122]  Yet, we're not allowed to do the same.
[03:37:42.122 --> 03:37:50.575]  I mean, we can't own guns because, you know, everyone's okay and everything, you know, we're paranoid and everything's alright and everything's safe.
[03:37:50.575 --> 03:37:51.456]  Well, what if it isn't?
[03:37:51.456 --> 03:37:54.721]  Why can't we have the option of this preventative self-defense?
[03:37:55.462 --> 03:38:00.944]  And I come from the former Soviet Union and we invented FEMA cams.
[03:38:00.944 --> 03:38:06.305]  We had the largest Gulag system ever and we still have it.
[03:38:06.305 --> 03:38:10.827]  And it's actually... I'll tie this into the fluoride debate.
[03:38:10.827 --> 03:38:14.248]  I don't need any proof about whether fluoride is good or bad for you.
[03:38:14.248 --> 03:38:18.709]  The only fact I need to know is that the first time fluoridation was used in water was
[03:38:19.649 --> 03:38:20.169]  Yeah, I wonder, like,
[03:38:47.150 --> 03:38:50.853]  Pose a question to all the people out there who are listening.
[03:38:50.853 --> 03:38:54.977]  I'd say, who's to blame for this, for the shooting?
[03:38:54.977 --> 03:38:57.179]  Choice A, the guns.
[03:38:57.179 --> 03:38:59.621]  B, the Second Amendment.
[03:38:59.621 --> 03:39:01.162]  C, the individual.
[03:39:01.162 --> 03:39:04.325]  D, SSRI drugs.
[03:39:04.325 --> 03:39:08.709]  E, our culture that they put, the agenda that our culture pushes.
[03:39:08.709 --> 03:39:14.774]  Or choice F, both C and D. It's the individual,
[03:39:15.600 --> 03:39:17.781]  And the SSRI drugs.
[03:39:17.781 --> 03:39:20.421]  Right, because the individual is not an island.
[03:39:20.421 --> 03:39:24.122]  The individual is influenced and sculpted by factors.
[03:39:24.122 --> 03:39:25.843]  So of course it has to be more than one.
[03:39:25.843 --> 03:39:44.948]  Yeah, and you know, it's just like how they culturally and collectively and selectively, the gatekeepers decide what's going to be reported on and what's not going to be reported on to push their agenda to destroy the Bill of Rights and our Constitution.
[03:39:45.908 --> 03:40:02.952]  As humanity is manipulated into a global order, and as we're bought off by the institutions, as the globalists buy off the institutions, our sheriffs, our mayors, our politicians.
[03:40:02.952 --> 03:40:11.094]  It's like, are we going to selectively blame Alex for driving his Dodge Hellcat through an intersection and killing a family?
[03:40:11.094 --> 03:40:14.195]  Are we going to now ban all the Dodge Hellcats that are out there?
[03:40:15.973 --> 03:40:24.399]  That's why I don't trust Trump because, you know, he pays for all his favors, you know, he buys off corporations and whatnot.
[03:40:24.399 --> 03:40:37.067]  Versus like, um, what, uh, Rand Paul, you know, he asked for contributions from, he asked for favors, he asked for contributions from his boss.
[03:40:37.067 --> 03:40:41.450]  Right, well, it's interesting when a crook admits he's a crook because the system allows him to be, right?
[03:40:42.802 --> 03:40:43.784]  Very good points.
[03:40:43.784 --> 03:40:45.928]  Thank you, Eric.
[03:40:45.928 --> 03:40:48.052]  Let's go to Dave.
[03:40:48.052 --> 03:40:50.035]  Dave, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:40:51.092 --> 03:40:51.812]  Hi, Julia.
[03:40:51.812 --> 03:40:54.174]  I think you're going to be a good guest host.
[03:40:54.174 --> 03:40:54.854]  Keep it up.
[03:40:54.854 --> 03:40:55.555]  Thank you.
[03:40:55.555 --> 03:40:56.936]  I'd like to move here.
[03:40:56.936 --> 03:41:08.343]  You know, I'm sorry to interrupt your call, but I just really want to point out my love for Austin because as soon as I got here, I go to a gas station and a 16-year-old boy opens the door for me.
[03:41:08.343 --> 03:41:10.464]  And I walk through and I say, thank you very much.
[03:41:10.464 --> 03:41:13.626]  And he says, yes, ma'am.
[03:41:13.626 --> 03:41:17.889]  Living in San Francisco for a month, nothing even came close to that.
[03:41:17.889 --> 03:41:19.270]  So I just I love it here.
[03:41:19.270 --> 03:41:19.750]  But go on.
[03:41:19.750 --> 03:41:20.531]  What would you like to say?
[03:41:21.303 --> 03:41:22.624]  OK, well, a couple of things.
[03:41:22.624 --> 03:41:26.105]  One is I think they should put a fence around Washington, D.C.
[03:41:26.105 --> 03:41:30.086]  Actually, parts of northern California are really nice and old fashioned.
[03:41:30.086 --> 03:41:31.347]  And I've lived here a long time.
[03:41:31.347 --> 03:41:37.149]  I mean, I'm basically a California redneck, so we're not all like like that.
[03:41:37.149 --> 03:41:46.233]  And my comment was specific to the film that you did a long time ago on feminism, which was my first real exposure to feminism.
[03:41:46.233 --> 03:41:47.213]  Thank you for watching.
[03:41:47.213 --> 03:41:49.374]  And I took that film and I posted links to it.
[03:41:49.890 --> 03:41:53.691]  In Cindy Sheehan's, uh, Cindy Sheehan for President site.
[03:41:53.691 --> 03:41:54.951]  Because I liked Cindy Sheehan.
[03:41:54.951 --> 03:41:56.091]  I liked a lot of what she said.
[03:41:56.091 --> 03:41:58.772]  In particular, her anti-war stance.
[03:41:58.772 --> 03:42:00.712]  And boy did I get clobbered for that.
[03:42:00.712 --> 03:42:01.612]  I got booted out of her.
[03:42:01.612 --> 03:42:03.513]  You know what I mean?
[03:42:03.513 --> 03:42:05.553]  It was, it was... Well, you're a man.
[03:42:05.553 --> 03:42:07.974]  You're not allowed to have a voice on, uh, feminism.
[03:42:07.974 --> 03:42:08.874]  Boy, yeah.
[03:42:08.874 --> 03:42:10.634]  Anyway, no great loss.
[03:42:10.634 --> 03:42:14.095]  But, uh, I have a question for you and then I'll take the answer off air if you don't mind.
[03:42:15.199 --> 03:42:16.059]  Uh, Canada.
[03:42:16.059 --> 03:42:18.042]  Could you talk about Canada a little bit more?
[03:42:18.042 --> 03:42:19.904]  You seem to have quite a bit of experience.
[03:42:19.904 --> 03:42:22.366]  It's been really nice talking to you.
[03:42:22.366 --> 03:42:23.467]  Okay.
[03:42:23.467 --> 03:42:24.368]  Uh, Canada.
[03:42:24.368 --> 03:42:24.769]  Alright.
[03:42:24.769 --> 03:42:28.873]  Well, I guess I can start with some of our gun laws.
[03:42:28.873 --> 03:42:30.975]  I mean, Canada has a really bad one where
[03:42:31.756 --> 03:42:32.056]  If you
[03:42:48.210 --> 03:42:57.913]  And I don't file to my overlords and get that piece of paper renewed, then I am a criminal and I can go to jail for having an expired gun license.
[03:42:57.913 --> 03:43:03.214]  So that's one thing that's quite sad about the state of affairs there.
[03:43:03.214 --> 03:43:06.975]  Canada has very rich gun ownership, very rich hunting community.
[03:43:07.615 --> 03:43:16.884]  And, aside from the major cities, you drive out a little bit, and the people are actually very American in mentality, if I can say that.
[03:43:16.884 --> 03:43:21.248]  Because Canadians in cities tend to have this bigotry against Americans.
[03:43:21.248 --> 03:43:32.317]  You know, I've used the term America to encompass the whole continent, and they say things like, oh, don't put us in the same category as the United States.
[03:43:32.317 --> 03:43:32.998]  Like, we're better.
[03:43:34.359 --> 03:43:39.161]  Canada is America's hat.
[03:43:39.161 --> 03:43:48.545]  Harper panders to America and our government officials take the blueprint of America and do a lot of things in Canada with it.
[03:43:48.545 --> 03:43:52.767]  And apart from our socialist health care, it's not that different.
[03:43:52.767 --> 03:43:56.009]  I mean, of course, the people are different, but it's not that different.
[03:43:57.009 --> 03:44:02.473]  I don't know, the healthcare thing, people bring up, we have really wonderful healthcare.
[03:44:02.473 --> 03:44:08.498]  Canada has amazing healthcare if your bone is sticking out and you're visibly bleeding and in pain.
[03:44:08.498 --> 03:44:15.944]  If something's wrong with you chronically, internally, something's undiagnosed, you need a specialist, there's a very high chance that you will die.
[03:44:15.944 --> 03:44:19.646]  And we have one of the highest rates of deaths in waiting rooms.
[03:44:20.907 --> 03:44:23.988]  What else can I say about Canada?
[03:44:23.988 --> 03:44:33.230]  Beautiful country, passive people, very, you know, again, in the major cities, like in most places, very liberal and progressive.
[03:44:33.230 --> 03:44:42.352]  And because we have such a high standard of living, people don't really pay attention to the realities that others face.
[03:44:42.352 --> 03:44:47.413]  Although there are so many cases in Canada that go overlooked.
[03:44:48.774 --> 03:44:53.264]  In terms of rights and freedom of speech, I have something on my website about our...
[03:44:54.665 --> 03:44:57.828]  Anti-defamation law, and that's pretty terrible.
[03:44:57.828 --> 03:45:06.094]  Basically, if you say anything about anybody in Canada, they can sue you dry for anti-defamation.
[03:45:06.094 --> 03:45:18.745]  And the funniest thing about that law, you don't even have to prove that the person's reputation or career or persona was hurt or damaged in any way.
[03:45:19.265 --> 03:45:25.867]  When you file an anti-defamation lawsuit, it is presupposed that defamation occurred.
[03:45:25.867 --> 03:45:28.988]  So that's the unique thing about Canada as well.
[03:45:28.988 --> 03:45:35.529]  And I guess I'll end on the most tragic one of our... It's not even a law, it's a lack of law.
[03:45:35.529 --> 03:45:41.771]  Canada is one of the three countries that has abortion to the moment of birth.
[03:45:41.771 --> 03:45:47.153]  So we're in the same category as North Korea, China and Canada.
[03:45:47.153 --> 03:45:48.373]  You can abort a baby
[03:45:49.173 --> 03:45:51.515]  Um, as long, like up to the moment of birth.
[03:45:51.515 --> 03:45:56.140]  So it's not a human being until it fully exits the birth canal.
[03:45:56.140 --> 03:46:04.667]  And I know they even use that kind of, um, they use that as an out for, in Planned Parenthood, for legal late-term abortion, like post-abortion.
[03:46:04.667 --> 03:46:11.153]  So if the head is out, they can kill the child because the head, because the rest of the body is still in the mother.
[03:46:11.153 --> 03:46:13.395]  So that's quite a sad thing about my country.
[03:46:14.516 --> 03:46:15.857]  Let's take another caller.
[03:46:15.857 --> 03:46:25.045]  Steve from Virginia, you're on the air on the Alex Jones Show with Julia Transke of Brave the World.
[03:46:25.045 --> 03:46:29.528]  Hey Sam, it's nice to meet you, Julia.
[03:46:29.528 --> 03:46:38.516]  I live in Linden, Virginia, apparently the shooter who killed those people in Norfolk shot himself over near my neighborhood.
[03:46:38.516 --> 03:46:42.559]  Now, a couple strange things that have been going on.
[03:46:44.673 --> 03:46:50.255]  First of all, they've had the highway locked down, Route 66 eastbound.
[03:46:50.255 --> 03:47:10.421]  I live off of Route 55 here, and there have been trucks, semi-trucks, and a lot more traffic on 55 because they, I guess they maybe cut out 66 between the Markham exit, that's exit 18, and exit 13, the Linden exit, for the crime scene investigation dealing with this issue.
[03:47:12.168 --> 03:47:31.671]  The strangest thing that me and my neighbors and I noticed was that over an hour and a half after the announcement that the gunman had shot himself, there were several helicopters in the area here, and a couple of them were really close, that they were flying at treetop level.
[03:47:31.671 --> 03:47:39.353]  It seemed to be that they were looking for someone or something, and yet, an hour and a half before that,
[03:47:40.930 --> 03:47:43.732]  I mean, they were flying low and all over the place.
[03:47:43.732 --> 03:47:48.915]  They were looking for something after the press announced that he had shot himself.
[03:47:48.915 --> 03:47:49.996]  Over an hour and a half.
[03:47:49.996 --> 03:47:52.698]  Now, we had up to 10 helicopters here today.
[03:47:52.698 --> 03:47:54.519]  They're all gone now.
[03:47:54.519 --> 03:48:00.603]  But I don't think that this situation, I don't think what they're telling us is all of the story.
[03:48:00.603 --> 03:48:06.526]  I'm not going to say for sure that I don't know if there was an accomplice or something.
[03:48:06.526 --> 03:48:08.107]  But something is not right.
[03:48:08.107 --> 03:48:10.269]  You should write all that up and try to submit it
[03:48:14.805 --> 03:48:16.405]  I'm sorry, I pulled you out.
[03:48:16.405 --> 03:48:17.846]  I pulled the sound out for a second.
[03:48:17.846 --> 03:48:23.207]  You should write all that up and try to submit it to maybe any kind of media outlet that would take you.
[03:48:23.207 --> 03:48:25.928]  Get it out there.
[03:48:25.928 --> 03:48:29.628]  Well, I mean, I think a great place is calling into InfoWars.
[03:48:29.628 --> 03:48:30.489]  Yeah, for sure.
[03:48:30.489 --> 03:48:33.349]  I've never called in before.
[03:48:33.349 --> 03:48:34.310]  I'm a tradesman.
[03:48:34.310 --> 03:48:36.010]  You know, I got my own business, whatever.
[03:48:36.010 --> 03:48:36.850]  I got a job.
[03:48:36.850 --> 03:48:38.390]  I'm a tradesman.
[03:48:38.390 --> 03:48:40.611]  I happened to be off today when this happened.
[03:48:41.871 --> 03:49:09.729]  I think it would be, I think it'd be a great idea to just send in your observation to all of the kind of more main, like more of the mainstream dinosaur media too, because we do have a specific audience and it would be, like I always comment even about my own channel, like how do you escape the petri dish of libertarianism and anarchism and people who are into freedom in general, so that people like you who observe things, you know, firsthand and actually getting out, you know, journalists
[03:49:10.149 --> 03:49:13.310]  You know, they have an agenda, but at the end of the day, they need something to report.
[03:49:13.310 --> 03:49:15.111]  They always want to get some new information.
[03:49:15.111 --> 03:49:20.353]  So I would highly recommend just trying to get through to them a little bit.
[03:49:20.353 --> 03:49:22.654]  Let me just say this in reference to that.
[03:49:22.654 --> 03:49:24.815]  We had a situation out here.
[03:49:24.815 --> 03:49:32.378]  I live next to the train tracks, and they've been blocking us in for years now, for hours on end, hundreds of times.
[03:49:32.378 --> 03:49:35.780]  And finally, we got seven on your side.
[03:49:35.780 --> 03:49:37.140]  That's WJLA.
[03:49:37.140 --> 03:49:38.781]  That's the local news service.
[03:49:39.520 --> 03:49:43.421]  They sent out a reporter, Steven Cheetah, to do the report here.
[03:49:43.421 --> 03:49:46.982]  He used to work for Fairfax Channel 8 News, but here's what happened.
[03:49:46.982 --> 03:49:50.323]  I called him today about it and they said, thanks, we're not interested.
[03:49:50.323 --> 03:49:56.706]  So I did make an effort just calling him today and reference the train track situation.
[03:49:56.706 --> 03:49:59.186]  Yeah, that's the problem with those guys, right?
[03:49:59.186 --> 03:50:01.647]  They can be very selective with their information.
[03:50:01.647 --> 03:50:04.168]  But thank you so much for sharing on the air.
[03:50:06.867 --> 03:50:14.109]  Let's go to Zach from Kansas and then we'll go to Jason from Florida after.
[03:50:14.109 --> 03:50:17.751]  Hi Zach, you're on the air with on the Alex Jones Show with Julia.
[03:50:17.751 --> 03:50:22.372]  Hi Julia, I just had a quick question here.
[03:50:22.372 --> 03:50:25.813]  You have a short time but we'll get back to you.
[03:50:25.813 --> 03:50:26.894]  So go ahead quickly.
[03:50:26.894 --> 03:50:30.455]  What are your thoughts on Bitcoin Core versus Bitcoin XT?
[03:50:31.536 --> 03:50:31.816]  Yeah.
[03:50:31.816 --> 03:50:37.399]  I will give you my thoughts right after the break and we'll be back on the Alex Jones Show in a few minutes.
[03:50:48.274 --> 03:50:52.256]  I'm Kaye Swirling from KSCO Radio in Santa Cruz.
[03:50:52.256 --> 03:51:02.082]  I'm 93 years old and I'm a big fan of Alex Jones because he has the courage to speak his mind more than just about anyone I know.
[03:51:02.082 --> 03:51:11.828]  Alex is just as bothered as I am about all the advertising you hear for toxic prescription drugs that make you sicker, not healthy.
[03:51:12.248 --> 03:51:20.733]  I prefer to give my body all 90 essential nutrients it needs for life to prevent disease, not compound it.
[03:51:20.733 --> 03:51:32.361]  My favorite complete supplement is Beyond Tangy Tangerine from Young Jeopardy, which I take every day along with EFA Plus and Beyond Osteo FX.
[03:51:33.061 --> 03:51:33.301]  Thank you.

[03:54:00.109 --> 03:54:02.231]  Hi there, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:02.231 --> 03:54:09.017]  My name is Julie Taransky and I am from BraveTheWorld.com filling in for Alex.
[03:54:09.017 --> 03:54:15.763]  The previous caller just asked me about what I think the block increase debate for Bitcoin.
[03:54:15.763 --> 03:54:26.033]  So there is XT, which is being pushed by Hearn and Gavin Andreessen, who has self-coined himself as chief engineer of Bitcoin.
[03:54:26.813 --> 03:54:28.835]  And they've been pushing this for over a year.
[03:54:28.835 --> 03:54:30.216]  Like this is a new news to me.
[03:54:30.216 --> 03:54:32.478]  This has been a problem in the community for a while.
[03:54:32.478 --> 03:54:35.521]  It's just new news because it's become very mainstream.
[03:54:35.521 --> 03:54:44.368]  And basically they've discredited themselves and they, you know, HERN, everything HERN has pushed throughout the years has been very,
[03:54:45.849 --> 03:54:46.209]  I think so.
[03:55:01.258 --> 03:55:01.559]  I don't
[03:55:22.099 --> 03:55:25.123]  You know, just become the cult of personality in Bitcoin.
[03:55:25.123 --> 03:55:29.910]  And you know, when you have a benevolent leader, they're benevolent until they're not.
[03:55:29.910 --> 03:55:33.415]  And nobody really accepted him as their leader anyways.
[03:55:33.415 --> 03:55:37.962]  It was all publicly constructed through the numerous interviews he's done.
[03:55:38.482 --> 03:55:56.435]  So XT is a terrible idea and I would take all the other core developers much more seriously who are organizing an event in Montreal this coming September to have an open dialogue about the changes and how we can maybe implement them incrementally and what is the best way of going about it.
[03:55:56.975 --> 03:56:16.467]  So, that's my opinion on that, and I actually had a boy from Blockstream, which is a company that employs these core devs, be on The Crypto Show the other day, so if you want to look up that episode on thecryptoshow.com, he really lays down the technical aspect and the political aspect very well.
[03:56:16.467 --> 03:56:17.448]  His name's Johnny Dilley.
[03:56:18.588 --> 03:56:20.630]  I can't go to the next caller.
[03:56:20.630 --> 03:56:22.032]  We don't have that much time left.
[03:56:22.032 --> 03:56:26.276]  I'm so sorry, Jason, but please call back next time.
[03:56:26.276 --> 03:56:33.923]  So I want to maybe wrap up with, since it's quite topical now with Planned Parenthood leaks, the abortion debate.
[03:56:34.783 --> 03:56:40.305]  And I mentioned that in Canada we have abortion up to the moment of birth.
[03:56:40.305 --> 03:56:48.927]  And I have a great video that I put forth that doesn't take any kind of approach from an agenda perspective.
[03:56:48.927 --> 03:56:53.108]  And if you guys want to just play the start of it.
[03:56:53.108 --> 03:56:57.249]  Most of us have a very strong opinion about abortion.
[03:56:57.249 --> 03:57:00.890]  This video is going to show you just how baseless that opinion is.
[03:57:04.235 --> 03:57:07.156]  It's easy to pick a side and never reconsider it.
[03:57:07.156 --> 03:57:10.957]  We don't really like to think about heavy things for too long.
[03:57:10.957 --> 03:57:16.198]  But this is a disgrace to logic, and in the case of abortion, it's unforgivable.
[03:57:16.198 --> 03:57:23.120]  Now, I won't be arguing whether abortion is okay based on religion, feminism, or what your president says.
[03:57:23.120 --> 03:57:26.421]  Abortion is a purely ethical issue.
[03:57:26.421 --> 03:57:29.082]  So, I'm gonna just elaborate on that.
[03:57:31.838 --> 03:57:40.708]  The whole debate has been hijacked with the political distinction between pro-life and pro-choice.
[03:57:40.708 --> 03:57:47.435]  And now the liberals are taking this new term, saying anti-choice, which is radicalizing the issue even further.
[03:57:47.435 --> 03:57:48.516]  Anti-choice.
[03:57:48.516 --> 03:57:51.860]  Whereas the pro-lifers are not anti-choice because
[03:57:52.981 --> 03:57:56.104]  Pro-choice is anti-choice.
[03:57:56.104 --> 03:58:00.528]  All the women that are aborted every year, where is their choice?
[03:58:00.528 --> 03:58:01.869]  They didn't have a choice in life.
[03:58:01.869 --> 03:58:09.296]  They're killed before they're allowed to make that choice because they're still human beings by every definition or non-definition that we have.
[03:58:09.296 --> 03:58:10.758]  It's all arbitrary.
[03:58:10.758 --> 03:58:11.859]  So check out that video.
[03:58:11.859 --> 03:58:12.980]  You can find all my work on
[03:58:13.340 --> 03:58:15.261]  BraveTheWorld.com.
