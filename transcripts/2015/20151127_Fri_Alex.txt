[00:00:04.915 --> 00:00:06.216]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.216 --> 00:00:07.976]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.976 --> 00:00:09.737]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.737 --> 00:00:11.338]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.338 --> 00:00:12.858]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.858 --> 00:00:17.060]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.122]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.121]  Friday, November 27th.
[00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:29.142]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:00:29.142 --> 00:00:30.843]  We will be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:30.843 --> 00:00:33.105]  I'll be your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:37.727]  And of course, Black Friday madness has descended upon America.
[00:00:37.727 --> 00:00:48.894]  We're going to show you some of the much-expected brawling and rioting over Darth Vader toasters and vegetable steamers that we're seeing in malls and stores across America today.
[00:00:49.755 --> 00:00:53.458]  We're also going to be taking your calls at 800-259-9231.
[00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:56.700]  That's 800-259-9231.
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.084]  Two guests lined up as well, and these will be extremely interesting interviews.
[00:01:02.084 --> 00:01:04.046]  First up, Christopher Murphy.
[00:01:04.046 --> 00:01:10.671]  This is the lawyer for Gregory Allen Elliott, who is the artist from Toronto, and we've talked about this story before.
[00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:17.275]  Who faces six months in prison for disagreeing with feminists on Twitter.
[00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:19.396]  That was the sum of his crime.
[00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:21.858]  His life has been completely ruined.
[00:01:21.858 --> 00:01:27.062]  He's desperately trying to raise money to pay this $100,000 court bill.
[00:01:27.062 --> 00:01:34.166]  And this has got huge implications for free speech, not just in Canada, but on the internet in general for everyone.
[00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:40.731]  They're trying to create the precedent where harassing a feminist, which in their mind is disagreeing with them,
[00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:47.553]  It's a form of harassment that you can be put away for for six months, so that's going to be a huge interview.
[00:01:47.553 --> 00:01:52.594]  Also, CJ Pearson, you've probably seen him in the media before over the past few months.
[00:01:52.594 --> 00:02:02.417]  This is the black teen conservative activist who has already been making waves with his vehement criticism of President Obama and Black Lives Matter.
[00:02:03.092 --> 00:02:06.153]  He's had a plethora of viral videos.
[00:02:06.153 --> 00:02:18.519]  He's been attacked directly by White House aides because they can't pigeonhole him into these politically correct boxes because he's a young black conservative and he doesn't go along with Black Lives Matter.
[00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.520]  So it's going to be interesting to get his take on affairs.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.961]  Absolute ton of news, of course.
[00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:29.223]  We're going to delve into the geopolitical stuff with a shoot-down of the Russian fighter jet.
[00:02:29.223 --> 00:02:31.264]  But first up, we're going to talk about Black Friday.
[00:02:32.182 --> 00:02:49.959]  Because it seems to be declining in influence, which is a good thing, and yet still within hours of it beginning, and in fact beforehand yesterday, these videos were pouring out on the internet of people beating each other up over gods that they don't need and they can't afford anyway.
[00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.764]  And in fact, one of the top stories on Drudge Report right now is an InfoWars.com article.
[00:02:55.764 --> 00:02:57.945]  I'm going to play this video after the break.
[00:02:57.945 --> 00:02:58.746]  Black Friday!
[00:02:58.746 --> 00:03:01.408]  Americans brawl over vegetable steamers.
[00:03:01.408 --> 00:03:08.735]  Now what's interesting about this video, which isn't the case with the other videos that are embedded on this page, some people are saying that this is fake.
[00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:22.578]  So now the desire, the lust to get a viral video, to get it featured on a show like, you know, Jimmy Kimmel or whatever, is so vehement that people seem to be now staging the Black Friday brawl videos.
[00:03:22.578 --> 00:03:25.899]  And this is the one that's gone viral, so we're going to look into it.
[00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:36.801]  Also, again, a ton of others that are not staged and feature basically people punching the hell out of each other to get access to these cheap slave goods made in China that they don't need and can't afford.
[00:03:37.461 --> 00:03:40.744]  But there's a whole psychology behind Black Friday.
[00:03:40.744 --> 00:03:47.469]  It's not just about getting the deals, because as we will delve into, Black Friday is a complete scam.
[00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:59.359]  The retailers raise their prices in the months before Black Friday to then, in comparison, make the Black Friday deals seem like a bargain, seem like a discount, a great deal.
[00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:01.679]  It's a complete scam.
[00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:03.940]  So why do people still do it?
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:12.202]  Why do they brave these aggressive mob crowds to try and get their hands on these products which don't even offer much of a discount?
[00:04:12.202 --> 00:04:18.683]  And there's a psychological, well there's a couple of psychological reasons behind it which we will touch upon.
[00:04:18.683 --> 00:04:27.765]  Yesterday Donald Trump came out and tweeted Infowars and the liberals, the regressive progressives, went into a complete meltdown.
[00:04:28.795 --> 00:04:51.543]  Based on the very fact that he merely tweeted out a link to Infowars.com, he then quoted yours truly, and the butthurt crybaby meltdown amongst the Liberals continued, and of course that surrounded a couple of controversies that have been swirling around Donald Trump this week regarding so-called Muslims celebrating 9-11, and of course his treatment of this disabled reporter.
[00:04:51.543 --> 00:04:53.864]  We'll get back on it after the break.
[00:04:53.864 --> 00:04:55.505]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:04:55.505 --> 00:04:56.065]  Stay tuned.
[00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:01.992]  All you pro-vaccine people should rejoice at this news!
[00:05:01.992 --> 00:05:07.474]  Anti-vaccine parents to stop receiving child care benefits under Australian no-jab-no-pay law.
[00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:15.717]  The new changes that will take effect on January 1st, 2016 are projected to save the Australian government over $500 million over four years.
[00:05:15.717 --> 00:05:18.458]  And how many children are not receiving their vaccines?
[00:05:18.458 --> 00:05:21.339]  According to the Australian Childhood Immunization Register, it's 1.77%.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.283]  I thought all you needed was 90% to have herd immunity.
[00:05:27.283 --> 00:05:33.509]  The government believes that by removing the non-medical exemption, it will reinforce the importance of immunization and protecting public health.
[00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:37.953]  But what this is really about is the government wants to put anything in your body that they want.
[00:05:37.953 --> 00:05:40.235]  And they want to make sure you bend over and take it.
[00:05:40.235 --> 00:05:44.899]  A footnote in the article is that by 2020, childless couples will overtake those with children.
[00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:48.142]  Now I know where the next Muslim migrant invasion is going to take place.
[00:05:48.342 --> 00:05:51.928]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars Nightly News and InfoWars.com.

[00:08:11.264 --> 00:08:14.846]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:14.846 --> 00:08:19.009]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:29.192 --> 00:08:33.055]  It's the Alex Jones Show Live Black Friday edition!
[00:08:33.055 --> 00:08:37.298]  And one of our artists is up at the top of drudgereport.com right now.
[00:08:37.298 --> 00:08:41.041]  Black Friday, Americans crawl over vegetable steamers.
[00:08:41.041 --> 00:08:53.730]  A video out of Saginaw, Michigan shows a Black Friday shopper crawling over vegetable steamers as one woman steals an item from a child before being physically attacked by the kid's mother.
[00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:54.851]  Let's go to this clip.
[00:08:59.269 --> 00:09:14.537]  So, basically, they pile into this, uh, these boxes of vegetable steamers, then you look, the woman tries to grab it, she grabs it from the child, then gets in a fight with the child's mother, and there's a slow-mo of this coming up where you can see it again.
[00:09:14.537 --> 00:09:18.759]  So the lady in red grabs the box there from the child,
[00:09:19.665 --> 00:09:22.067]  The mother then gets into a fight with her.
[00:09:22.067 --> 00:09:27.212]  But some people have watched this video, and if you look at the comments on YouTube, it's quite convincing.
[00:09:27.212 --> 00:09:37.901]  They're saying that it's staged, because the black lady with the child appears to have the boxes in hand before the mob rushes towards the pile of them.
[00:09:37.901 --> 00:09:41.524]  And then you have this incident with the other lady grabbing the box off the child.
[00:09:42.406 --> 00:09:44.947]  So some people are saying that this is staged.
[00:09:44.947 --> 00:09:47.147]  Why would they need to stage it?
[00:09:47.147 --> 00:09:53.489]  Well, simply because these videos go viral every single year, and this is the one that has gone viral so far.
[00:09:53.489 --> 00:09:58.311]  They're routinely played on all the evening shows, Jimmy Kimmel and so forth.
[00:09:58.311 --> 00:10:07.953]  So if somebody wants to get a few million views on a YouTube video, and you can get some decent ad commission off that, then it's certainly worthwhile doing.
[00:10:07.953 --> 00:10:09.174]  So the jury's still out.
[00:10:10.534 --> 00:10:29.260]  If you then look at this article and scroll down, there are probably five or six other videos, which are definitely not staged, of Black Friday shoppers, and again this started yesterday, the day before, basically ploughing into each other, brawling, fighting, screaming, punching each other.
[00:10:30.052 --> 00:10:38.661]  Over these goods, again, which they probably don't need, probably can't afford, getting into more mountains of debt simply to get their hands on them.
[00:10:38.661 --> 00:10:42.244]  So whereas that video might be staged, the others certainly aren't.
[00:10:42.244 --> 00:10:50.593]  And we put out the article yesterday, as we make this point every single year, Black Friday is a complete scam.
[00:10:51.792 --> 00:11:03.922]  It's proven now that the biggest retailers raise their prices in the months before Black Friday to then, in comparison, make it look as if people are getting a discount when they're not.
[00:11:03.922 --> 00:11:06.304]  And if you look at the stats which are linked in this article,
[00:11:07.324 --> 00:11:09.265]  Why Black Friday is a complete scam.
[00:11:09.265 --> 00:11:21.250]  Bloomberg Businessweek reports that among the 15 largest US retailers operating margins in the holiday quarter, this is 2013, were 11% compared with 9% in the preceding nine months.
[00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:26.152]  So they don't take a hit for Black Friday, these large retailers.
[00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:29.973]  They actually make more profit on Black Friday.
[00:11:29.973 --> 00:11:30.634]  A, because
[00:11:31.494 --> 00:11:36.975]  These so-called discounts aren't really discounts, they're just in comparison to the previous price rises.
[00:11:36.975 --> 00:11:42.097]  And then B, they put a 98% markup on other items.
[00:11:42.097 --> 00:11:53.659]  So when people are getting the flat screen TV or whatever they want, they're then on the way to buying this product, picking up another item that's been marked up by 98%.
[00:11:53.659 --> 00:11:56.140]  So the retailer still makes a huge profit.
[00:11:56.832 --> 00:12:08.516]  This has been known for years and yet people are still camping outside, you know, Walmarts and Sears and wherever else to get these so-called discounts, these bargains, that aren't even bargains.
[00:12:08.516 --> 00:12:15.898]  And then the other factor is, and you can look at this for Amazon.com for example, you can get the same product
[00:12:16.684 --> 00:12:21.148]  For the same price on Amazon.com two days before Black Friday.
[00:12:21.148 --> 00:12:24.010]  There was a big thing about Darth Vader toasters.
[00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.033]  This was the must-have item that everybody wanted.
[00:12:27.033 --> 00:12:34.960]  People were camping out for hours, in some cases more than 24 hours, to be the first to get their hands on this, you know, this rare...
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:41.902]  Item, which everybody really, really must have and is vitally important for the quality of their life.
[00:12:41.902 --> 00:12:47.944]  A Darth Vader toaster, which I don't remember the exact figure, but they were going to get it for about, you know, $40.
[00:12:47.944 --> 00:13:00.228]  They could have gone on Amazon two days before, not wasted their time on Thanksgiving camping outside the store, and got it for the exact same price.
[00:13:00.228 --> 00:13:02.529]  And this is why we draw attention to this every year, because
[00:13:03.547 --> 00:13:12.090]  These so-called discounts, they don't just begin on Black Friday anymore, they begin on the Wednesday, the Thursday, Thanksgiving, one, two days before.
[00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:24.235]  People are literally sacrificing crucial family time that they wouldn't get at any other time of year to camp out and buy these worthless products, which they could just sit at home and order on Amazon.
[00:13:25.003 --> 00:13:27.944]  It's complete insanity, and we're gonna get into why they do that.
[00:13:27.944 --> 00:13:30.145]  It's not just this idea of getting a discount.
[00:13:30.145 --> 00:13:44.551]  But as he does on an annual basis now, Mark Dice was out there in San Diego, I believe it was, trolling these people who sacrificed crucial family time to camp outside to buy a Darth Vader toaster.
[00:13:44.551 --> 00:13:45.692]  Here's the clip.
[00:13:45.692 --> 00:13:50.214]  Santa Claus here to shame the Thanksgiving shoppers.
[00:13:52.338 --> 00:14:06.147]  The Center of Disease Control, the CDC, has discovered that tens of millions of turkeys were infected by a dangerous parasite, quickly devouring the brains of millions of Americans after Thanksgiving dinner.
[00:14:06.147 --> 00:14:20.937]  No longer having any brain cells left, the television took over, leading them to retail establishments, leading them outside of their families, outside of their homes, ruining the Thanksgiving holiday.
[00:14:20.937 --> 00:14:21.137]  Now,
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.943]  Waiting in line to buy more electronic goods.
[00:14:25.943 --> 00:14:29.126]  To detach themselves further from reality.
[00:14:29.126 --> 00:14:31.267]  Going deeper into debt.
[00:14:31.267 --> 00:14:33.549]  Spending money you don't have on things you don't need.
[00:14:33.549 --> 00:14:35.591]  Merry Christmas to you too!
[00:14:35.591 --> 00:14:37.813]  Happy Thanksgiving brother.
[00:14:37.813 --> 00:14:39.714]  Planting seeds of sanity.
[00:14:39.714 --> 00:14:41.295]  I hope they take root.
[00:14:41.295 --> 00:14:43.177]  Ho ho ho!
[00:14:43.177 --> 00:14:46.039]  Tonight on The Walking Dead.
[00:14:46.039 --> 00:14:49.262]  The zombies have congregated near retail establishments.
[00:14:50.254 --> 00:14:53.755]  In quest of new televisions.
[00:14:53.755 --> 00:14:58.257]  The vast majority of America now a complete zombie wasteland.
[00:14:58.257 --> 00:15:00.238]  Of corporate debt slaves.
[00:15:00.238 --> 00:15:04.140]  Ruining Thanksgiving unaware of their own idiocy.
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:09.362]  Waiting hours in line to spend money that they don't have on things they don't need.
[00:15:09.362 --> 00:15:13.784]  To go deeper into debt that you will probably regret.
[00:15:13.784 --> 00:15:14.424]  Shame on you all.
[00:15:15.683 --> 00:15:20.235]  These walkers confused that the doors are closed.
[00:15:20.235 --> 00:15:22.982]  Unaware of how to gain access to the building.
[00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:45.822]  So far, no signs of walkers at Barnes & Noble.
[00:15:45.822 --> 00:15:52.267]  Zombies congregating towards places that carry electronic devices.
[00:15:52.267 --> 00:15:53.989]  Allergic to books and knowledge.
[00:15:55.086 --> 00:15:59.930]  A lone security guard patrolling for the possibility of any zombies.
[00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:05.534]  Have you seen any zombies out here today, sir?
[00:16:05.534 --> 00:16:07.715]  Any zombies today?
[00:16:07.715 --> 00:16:10.857]  You're gonna ask me to leave?
[00:16:10.857 --> 00:16:12.018]  I'm disrupting.
[00:16:12.018 --> 00:16:12.619]  Okay.
[00:16:12.619 --> 00:16:16.962]  Happy Thanksgiving.
[00:16:16.962 --> 00:16:23.887]  Again, I am the one disrupting the hordes of zombies loved by Americans.
[00:16:25.947 --> 00:16:34.112]  Now, the lone voice of sanity being expelled from the shopping center.
[00:16:34.112 --> 00:16:36.014]  Subscribe to the Montez YouTube channel!
[00:16:37.451 --> 00:16:37.912]  Stay tuned!
[00:16:37.912 --> 00:16:41.895]  Alright, that's Mark Dice with his annual crawling of Black Friday shoppers again.
[00:16:41.895 --> 00:16:44.317]  He was kicked out via security.
[00:16:44.317 --> 00:16:50.843]  Basically making the point that the zombie hordes weren't lined up outside Barnes & Noble.
[00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:53.305]  But it's interesting if you delve into this.
[00:16:53.305 --> 00:16:56.668]  As I just mentioned, they're not even getting a good deal.
[00:16:56.668 --> 00:16:58.749]  And a lot of people probably know that by now.
[00:16:58.749 --> 00:17:04.734]  They probably know that they can just sit at home and buy the exact same item for the same price, if not less.
[00:17:05.535 --> 00:17:07.199]  From Amazon.com.
[00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:16.157]  Yet they choose to engage in this annual mob rush to get these items and as of this morning there are numerous videos of people brawling, punching,
[00:17:16.841 --> 00:17:18.242]  Obviously more to come.
[00:17:18.242 --> 00:17:26.250]  But The Independent came out with an article which was interesting called Black Friday, the science behind why people kill each other over TVs.
[00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:29.753]  And it turns out that this is not just about competition.
[00:17:29.753 --> 00:17:34.077]  Of course, now that people are more sedentary, they're not involved in as much sports.
[00:17:34.077 --> 00:17:36.640]  This is basically the only kind of competition they get.
[00:17:37.395 --> 00:17:48.765]  The competition to, you know, try to find resources that would normally be scarce if you believe the propaganda about artificial scarcity, which the media pumps up in advance of Black Friday.
[00:17:48.765 --> 00:17:55.090]  But they actually create the conditions, the retailers do, for this mob violence.
[00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:59.934]  Because they make people conform to social norms by queuing up, okay?
[00:17:59.934 --> 00:18:05.419]  So people think, I'm after you in the queue, this is when I get in, this is when I get my turn.
[00:18:05.419 --> 00:18:05.559]  So,
[00:18:06.522 --> 00:18:17.648]  They've already created that condition where this social norm is in place, and if anyone deviates from that, they're going to attract the hate of the mob justice.
[00:18:17.648 --> 00:18:21.770]  So when they open the actual door on Black Friday, what do they do?
[00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:25.051]  They don't let people in one by one who have queued up in order.
[00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:27.492]  They let everybody in at once!
[00:18:27.492 --> 00:18:32.675]  And in fact, they placed the most highly sought-after discounted goods at the very front of the store.
[00:18:33.448 --> 00:18:43.737]  Again, ensuring that the mob will rush in to grab those, you know, discounts, those items that have been, that have had artificial scarcity produced around them.
[00:18:43.737 --> 00:18:48.582]  So the retailers create the very conditions for this violent behavior which we see every year.
[00:18:49.122 --> 00:18:58.571]  By making people queue up and conform to this social norm and then instantly breaking it and allowing the mob to all rush in at once.
[00:18:58.571 --> 00:19:08.559]  So that's why people get enraged with this kind of injustice that they saw the product first or they grabbed the product first or they were first in the line before that person.
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.341]  And then it's completely tribal.
[00:19:11.341 --> 00:19:18.905]  If you drill down into it, it's the tribal rush for resources that are scarce in the minds of these brainwashed zombies.
[00:19:19.881 --> 00:19:35.916]  So it's not really their fault, it's the fault of the retailers, it's the fault of the media who gin this up beforehand to create this very kind of violence which then of course produces great copy, great video footage for the evening news.
[00:19:35.916 --> 00:19:39.139]  The good news is that Black Friday is becoming less and less popular.
[00:19:39.139 --> 00:19:41.521]  There's an article out of Reuters which details that today.
[00:19:42.282 --> 00:19:54.175]  Because people are finally beginning to realize that A, it's a scam, they're not getting the discount they think they're getting, and they can buy the same product anyway on Amazon.com without camping outside and wasting Thanksgiving.
[00:19:54.175 --> 00:19:56.077]  We'll be back with more news.
[00:19:56.077 --> 00:19:57.478]  It's the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:19:57.478 --> 00:19:57.979]  Stay tuned.
[00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:06.191]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[00:20:06.191 --> 00:20:10.472]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[00:20:10.472 --> 00:20:11.852]  We typically do the same thing.
[00:20:11.852 --> 00:20:14.892]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[00:20:14.892 --> 00:20:17.093]  But have you considered heat storage?
[00:20:17.093 --> 00:20:19.293]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[00:20:19.293 --> 00:20:21.593]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[00:20:21.593 --> 00:20:23.234]  How will I keep my family warm?
[00:20:23.234 --> 00:20:25.714]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[00:20:25.714 --> 00:20:29.775]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[00:20:30.595 --> 00:20:31.716]  Another concern?
[00:20:31.716 --> 00:20:35.699]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[00:20:35.699 --> 00:20:38.281]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[00:20:38.281 --> 00:20:42.264]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[00:20:42.264 --> 00:20:45.066]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[00:20:45.066 --> 00:20:49.730]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.

[00:20:51.731 --> 00:20:53.373]  FortressClothing.com.
[00:20:53.373 --> 00:20:54.714]  You'll never be cold again.

[00:22:03.875 --> 00:22:07.438]  That's why Infidel Body Armor introduces Infidel Fridays.

[00:22:57.751 --> 00:23:01.054]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[00:23:01.054 --> 00:23:06.558]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[00:23:06.558 --> 00:23:08.820]  But they're about to lose control.
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:14.144]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[00:23:14.144 --> 00:23:18.747]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:23:18.747 --> 00:23:20.789]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:24.612]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[00:23:24.952 --> 00:23:29.474]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[00:23:29.474 --> 00:23:35.196]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves, but this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:23:35.196 --> 00:23:37.036]  This will affect us all.
[00:23:37.036 --> 00:23:40.518]  I've posted a free video at DollarDanger.com.
[00:23:41.778 --> 00:23:48.168]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.
[00:23:48.168 --> 00:23:54.276]  You can watch the video for free right now by going to DollarDanger.com.
[00:23:54.276 --> 00:23:56.279]  Again, that's DollarDanger.com.
[00:24:12.779 --> 00:24:16.962]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show, Black Friday edition.
[00:24:16.962 --> 00:24:20.104]  Another amazing video clip has emerged out of Germany now.
[00:24:20.104 --> 00:24:34.155]  Bearing in mind, Germany has just announced that they will begin bombing ISIS in Syria while allowing potential ISIS jihadists into Germany via the migrant program, of course.
[00:24:34.155 --> 00:24:36.256]  Potentially up to millions of migrants.
[00:24:37.017 --> 00:24:40.981]  Which, you know, ISIS has promised, hidden amongst them will be these jihadists.
[00:24:40.981 --> 00:24:43.143]  Again, completely insane policy.
[00:24:43.143 --> 00:24:48.109]  Some checks have gone in place now, at least, but the insanity still continues.
[00:24:48.109 --> 00:24:50.851]  And there's an article up on Infowars.com today.
[00:24:50.851 --> 00:24:56.938]  Pro-migrant politician celebrates demographic suicide of German population.
[00:24:57.958 --> 00:25:01.819]  And I'm going to narrate over this video clip because it's absolutely astounding.
[00:25:01.819 --> 00:25:20.565]  A video clip shows German Green Party politician, and it's always these left-wingers of course, Stephanie von Berg giving a speech in which she celebrates the fact that mass migration will bring an end to German majority populations in cities within a few decades.
[00:25:20.565 --> 00:25:21.125]  Here's the clip.
[00:25:23.732 --> 00:25:27.193]  So this is a speech in front of the German poll, and they're actually playing safe.
[00:25:27.193 --> 00:25:31.355]  I'll preface this by talking about Gregor Geise, you know, what you're hearing now is...
[00:25:39.397 --> 00:25:49.764]  Another German leftist politician who back in July started basically celebrating the fact that the German population was being replaced by these migrants.
[00:25:49.764 --> 00:25:55.528]  He labeled opposition to those migrants as Nazis and he basically said
[00:25:56.283 --> 00:25:59.564]  Quote, every year more native Germans die than are born.
[00:25:59.564 --> 00:26:00.845]  That is very fortunate.
[00:26:00.845 --> 00:26:04.586]  And he smacked his lips and looked very smug while he was saying this.
[00:26:04.586 --> 00:26:07.767]  Quote, it's because the Nazis are not very good at having offspring.
[00:26:07.767 --> 00:26:11.109]  So in Germany now, according to this leftist politician, Gregor Geisse...
[00:26:11.949 --> 00:26:22.773]  Anyone who opposes these German villagers, in some cases of, you know, a hundred people being flooded by a hundred up to a thousand migrants who aren't integrated into the population.
[00:26:22.773 --> 00:26:29.156]  Anyone who has a problem with that is a Nazi and he's happy about it because German people aren't having children.
[00:26:29.156 --> 00:26:34.618]  These migrants will be having children and of course they'll become dependent on the state and vote for his party.
[00:26:34.618 --> 00:26:36.639]  That's why he's so pleased about it.
[00:26:36.639 --> 00:26:39.400]  Now the other clip, which is at the top of this news article,
[00:26:40.379 --> 00:26:45.362]  is the female German Green Party politician, Stephanie von Berg.
[00:26:45.362 --> 00:26:51.165]  She gave a speech in front of Parliament, and this came out just a few days ago, where she basically said the same thing.
[00:26:52.924 --> 00:26:54.505]  Our society will change.
[00:26:54.505 --> 00:26:56.507]  Our city will change radically.
[00:26:56.507 --> 00:27:03.633]  I hold that in 20-30 years there will no longer be a German majority in our city.
[00:27:03.633 --> 00:27:07.216]  We have plenty of people and live in a super-cultural society.
[00:27:07.216 --> 00:27:08.958]  This is what we have in the future.
[00:27:08.958 --> 00:27:12.120]  And I want to make it very clear, especially to those right-wingers,
[00:27:12.981 --> 00:27:14.922]  This is a good thing.
[00:27:14.922 --> 00:27:21.847]  So again, she's celebrating the fact that the German population will be replaced by non-Germans.
[00:27:21.847 --> 00:27:25.369]  Demographic suicide, she's saying it's a good thing.
[00:27:25.369 --> 00:27:29.712]  So presumably she also thinks that the wave of crime and rape
[00:27:30.942 --> 00:27:36.524]  Which is documented that these migrants are already bringing to these German villages, towns and cities.
[00:27:36.524 --> 00:27:40.026]  We've exhaustively documented that over the past several months.
[00:27:40.026 --> 00:27:45.428]  The German authorities are covering it up so as not to legitimize critics of mass migration.
[00:27:45.428 --> 00:27:54.152]  They're going after people on Facebook who have concerns about this with the ex-Stasi official involved in that censorship program.
[00:27:54.152 --> 00:27:56.593]  And now this German Green Party politician
[00:27:57.825 --> 00:28:09.076]  ...gets up in front of the German Parliament and says it's a good thing that in 20 to 30 years Germans will be a minority in their own cities.
[00:28:09.076 --> 00:28:16.464]  And quite why they think that is a complete mystery, especially given the fact, well we know why it is because they're going to get votes from all the people dependent on government,
[00:28:17.406 --> 00:28:30.715]  But even Angela Merkel herself, the Chancellor of Germany, came out in 2010 and said that multiculturalism has utterly failed because immigrants do not integrate into German society.
[00:28:30.715 --> 00:28:33.257]  Alex Jones is on the phone right now with a comment on this.
[00:28:33.257 --> 00:28:33.978]  Alex, go ahead.
[00:28:33.978 --> 00:28:35.459]  That's right, Paul.
[00:28:35.459 --> 00:28:37.180]  I want to comment on this as I drive.
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.902]  Take care of business today on Black Friday.
[00:28:40.561 --> 00:28:40.882]  I don't know.
[00:28:51.949 --> 00:29:05.626]  But again, a twisted form of it where any culture, no matter if it's Japanese, German, whatever it is, has to have other populations brought in to be put at odds in classic, great game, divide and conquer strategy.
[00:29:05.626 --> 00:29:07.748]  Brzezinski admits this.
[00:29:07.748 --> 00:29:10.091]  All of them basically admit this.
[00:29:10.091 --> 00:29:11.253]  This is a real
[00:29:11.793 --> 00:29:13.134]  We're good to go.
[00:29:34.293 --> 00:29:37.956]  Stay there Alex, I'll be back after the break with more from Alex Jones.
[00:29:37.956 --> 00:29:39.418]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:58.857 --> 00:30:08.340]  Global warming advocates are now blaming luxury condominiums for man-made climate change, despite the record-breaking snowfall which recently pounded the northern U.S.
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:15.922]  The Climate Words for All coalition released a report claiming that luxury apartment buildings are the largest climate change offenders in New York City.
[00:30:15.922 --> 00:30:17.963]  These are New York City's largest buildings.
[00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:27.271]  Over 50,000 square feet in size, which primarily consists of a mixture of luxury apartments, commercial buildings, and multi-family housing developments, the report stated.
[00:30:27.271 --> 00:30:32.196]  The report was released just as New York was being pounded by heavy snowstorms.
[00:30:32.196 --> 00:30:43.426]  Global warming advocates, however, will attempt to blame this record snowfall on man-made climate change, even though a few years ago, they were predicting that the Earth's ice caps would have dramatically melted by now.
[00:30:43.766 --> 00:30:49.429]  But they really want you to live in a tiny apartment so they can cram more people into your neighborhood and tax the area.
[00:30:49.429 --> 00:30:57.833]  Keep up with our latest news and information on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:30:58.692 --> 00:30:59.632]  Alex Jones here.
[00:30:59.632 --> 00:31:16.319]  InfoWarsStore.com is now partnering with the top-of-the-line storable food company, My Patriot Supply, to bring you the highest quality, freshest, longest-lasting, most affordable storable foods, private-labeled, from InfoWarsSelect.com, at the lowest price you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:31:16.319 --> 00:31:18.040]  The globalists want us dependent.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.641]  We need to be self-sufficient.
[00:31:19.641 --> 00:31:24.803]  And if you don't have high-quality, long-lasting, storable foods, I believe you're making a huge mistake.
[00:31:25.003 --> 00:31:27.686]  My goal is to find the best deals and bring it to you.
[00:31:27.686 --> 00:31:32.913]  Now is the time to take action and to secure your pantry for any emergency.
[00:31:32.913 --> 00:31:36.737]  You can buy all the great MyPatriotSupply products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:36.737 --> 00:31:40.281]  They're the exact same products inside InfoWarsSelect.com.

[00:31:44.286 --> 00:31:47.868]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:31:47.868 --> 00:31:52.511]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[00:32:07.159 --> 00:32:07.819]  We're good to go.
[00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:29.711]  BrainForce is here.
[00:32:29.711 --> 00:32:31.913]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:32:31.913 --> 00:32:36.917]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:32:36.917 --> 00:32:38.598]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[00:32:38.598 --> 00:32:40.199]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:32:40.199 --> 00:32:43.682]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:32:43.682 --> 00:32:45.664]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:32:45.664 --> 00:32:46.545]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:32:46.545 --> 00:32:47.746]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:32:47.746 --> 00:32:49.787]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:32:49.787 --> 00:32:55.372]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:33:11.821 --> 00:33:17.848]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:23.803 --> 00:33:25.504]  We're back, it's the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:33:25.504 --> 00:33:30.925]  We've got our guest coming up, Christopher Murthy, who is the lawyer for Gregory Allen Elliott.
[00:33:30.925 --> 00:33:37.687]  Of course, he's the artist from Toronto who faces six months in prison for disagreeing with feminists on Twitter.
[00:33:37.687 --> 00:33:46.110]  This is a huge story that we've been covering for a few months now, and we've got the guest, the lawyer for Gregory Allen Elliott, coming on to talk about it here in a few minutes.
[00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:48.351]  But Alex Jones is still on the line.
[00:33:48.351 --> 00:33:52.072]  Of course, there was a huge meltdown yesterday over Donald Trump.
[00:33:52.572 --> 00:33:54.916]  Daring to tweet out an InfoWars link.
[00:33:54.916 --> 00:33:59.603]  The crybabies basically wet themselves in, uh, they were triggered.
[00:33:59.603 --> 00:34:03.148]  Triggered beyond words that he would even link, dare link to InfoWars.
[00:34:03.148 --> 00:34:04.571]  That was a huge story.
[00:34:04.571 --> 00:34:05.973]  And more on Black Friday.
[00:34:05.973 --> 00:34:06.554]  Alex Jones.
[00:34:07.895 --> 00:34:17.522]  That's right, and I'm going to get off here and let you go to your guest just in a moment, but look, InfoWars reaches 3 million people a day, rated, on AM and FM stations across the country.
[00:34:17.522 --> 00:34:20.864]  We reach several million a day just on our one YouTube channel a day.
[00:34:20.864 --> 00:34:26.828]  We have over 600, 700,000 that listen to the podcast every day.
[00:34:26.828 --> 00:34:29.910]  Hundreds of thousands that watch our free video feeds every day.
[00:34:29.910 --> 00:34:33.113]  We reach about 20 million people a week in the total aggregate.
[00:34:33.113 --> 00:34:35.094]  That's a very conservative number.
[00:34:35.094 --> 00:34:37.376]  And so MSNBC, with a couple million viewers,
[00:34:37.957 --> 00:34:41.627]  Makes fun of us and acts like we're not legitimate.
[00:34:41.627 --> 00:34:42.930]  They're jokes.
[00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:43.351]  Just like...
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:48.002]  I saw CNBC when they got laughed at a few months ago at the Republican debate.
[00:34:48.002 --> 00:34:48.982]  They're out of bullets.
[00:34:48.982 --> 00:34:50.283]  They don't have the moral authority.
[00:34:50.283 --> 00:34:56.146]  And from Europe to Canada to the United States, they're trying to arrest people that deny man-made global warming.
[00:34:56.146 --> 00:34:58.787]  They're trying to arrest people that criticize feminists.
[00:34:58.787 --> 00:35:03.929]  The new Facebook rules say if you disagree with someone, it's hate speech.
[00:35:03.929 --> 00:35:05.930]  And it's all selectively important.
[00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:09.432]  These are desperate totalitarians.
[00:35:09.432 --> 00:35:10.112]  And that's why
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:18.967]  In Germany, you have the two Green Party leaders in the Bundestag, in the Reichstag, saying the end of Germans is good, and they're both white Germans.
[00:35:18.967 --> 00:35:20.928]  These are racist against their own people.
[00:35:20.928 --> 00:35:22.689]  They say they're fighting Nazis.
[00:35:22.689 --> 00:35:24.931]  Well, Nazis are just race-based politicians.
[00:35:24.931 --> 00:35:34.579]  They are the race-based politicians bringing in the third world populations who might even not be bad people, and then turning them into race-based or religious-based haters.
[00:35:34.579 --> 00:35:35.980]  So that's what they're doing with this huge
[00:35:36.793 --> 00:35:39.297]  I'm against the police state.
[00:35:39.297 --> 00:35:42.241]  I criticize the bad police, the cops that are bad every day.
[00:35:42.241 --> 00:35:45.766]  It doesn't mean I support Soros saying go out and
[00:35:52.515 --> 00:35:58.161]  Blow up and kill the cops, and just blame some random cop, and just shoot them in the back of the head at a gas station.
[00:35:58.161 --> 00:36:04.207]  That is literal Red Terror style putsch, like we saw in Ukraine two years ago.
[00:36:04.207 --> 00:36:06.389]  We know their playbook, folks.
[00:36:06.389 --> 00:36:07.050]  We can beat them.
[00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:08.091]  Now, continuing.
[00:36:08.091 --> 00:36:09.132]  We're the real liberals.
[00:36:09.132 --> 00:36:11.174]  We're the libertarians.
[00:36:11.174 --> 00:36:12.636]  Shifting gears into Black Friday.
[00:36:14.358 --> 00:36:22.882]  Shifting gears into that situation, you were so eloquent earlier about how it's tribalism, it's the hunter-gathering, it's the only way you're allowed to compete.
[00:36:22.882 --> 00:36:25.083]  They psychologically set it up.
[00:36:25.083 --> 00:36:30.565]  Jim Morrison wrote his thesis at UCLA Film School about how to cause riots at stores.
[00:36:31.145 --> 00:36:37.929]  And how to do it where you put people, everybody at the door, and then open it up with the key items up front.
[00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:42.371]  It's funny that Jim Morrison of The Doors actually wrote about that in How to Start Riots.
[00:36:42.371 --> 00:36:43.632]  Folks can look into it.
[00:36:43.632 --> 00:36:49.736]  So this is done to create hysteria, to create mindlessness, and then it's not even the best deal.
[00:36:49.736 --> 00:36:54.018]  One of the worst years, one of the worst days of the year to buy products.
[00:36:54.018 --> 00:36:57.320]  But as you said, it's becoming unpopular because people are becoming
[00:36:58.378 --> 00:37:01.421]  Why is it they can shop online at places like Infowarsstore.com?
[00:37:01.421 --> 00:37:04.343]  So now I'm going to do a brief plug with Rob Duke.
[00:37:04.343 --> 00:37:05.704]  Let him elaborate on it.
[00:37:05.704 --> 00:37:10.107]  He said I ride shotgun with you at the studios in Austin, Texas on television and radio.
[00:37:10.107 --> 00:37:15.211]  I'm here driving down the highway taking care of business with the family, but here's the deal.
[00:37:15.211 --> 00:37:16.913]  We actually offer real deals.
[00:37:16.913 --> 00:37:23.978]  We take globalist frauds, we turn them into good things, into win-wins, into educational events.
[00:37:23.978 --> 00:37:27.481]  Free shipping through this weekend on everything at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:29.467]  We're good to go.
[00:37:49.122 --> 00:37:57.288]  And when people vote to support the Infowar, and get really good specials, they with their free will are funding a cultural change.
[00:37:57.288 --> 00:38:16.041]  When they buy a Hillary for Prison shirt, or when they buy a pro-Second Amendment Moanwabe shirt, or when they buy an Infowar's coffee cup as a gift, or when they get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, they are building this organization that's now multinational, in our reach, breaking huge news every day, and countering the globalists.
[00:38:16.041 --> 00:38:16.842]  So please folks,
[00:38:17.582 --> 00:38:18.603]  Continue your support.
[00:38:18.603 --> 00:38:19.864]  We want to thank you for your support.
[00:38:19.864 --> 00:38:22.526]  We count on sales like this to fund our operation.
[00:38:22.526 --> 00:38:27.030]  We make less money per item, but obviously we sell more.
[00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:30.193]  That's what sales are really about, and you can look at our prices.
[00:38:30.193 --> 00:38:32.875]  They're consistently the lowest of the year right now.
[00:38:32.875 --> 00:38:37.699]  You may have a few more specials like this right before Christmas, but we only do this two or three times a year.
[00:38:37.699 --> 00:38:41.242]  Infowarsstore.com, pre-shipping right now.
[00:38:41.242 --> 00:38:44.004]  And I get back to the Donald Trump situation and then to your guests.
[00:38:45.276 --> 00:38:49.721]  Donald Trump told the truth about radical Muslims celebrating on 9-11.
[00:38:49.721 --> 00:38:52.184]  Muslim kids said those towers won't be there next week.
[00:38:52.184 --> 00:38:52.884]  That was in.
[00:38:52.884 --> 00:38:53.585]  Thanks for your news.
[00:38:53.585 --> 00:38:54.626]  You can look that up.
[00:38:54.626 --> 00:38:56.048]  Then the towers were gone.
[00:38:56.048 --> 00:38:58.370]  People celebrated in Palestine.
[00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:00.613]  Other groups were caught celebrating.
[00:39:00.613 --> 00:39:03.316]  Look at the two stadium events, at the soccer games.
[00:39:04.537 --> 00:39:10.601]  Channing Hallaogbaar got us great during the one minute of silence for the 130 plus dead people in France.
[00:39:10.601 --> 00:39:17.266]  So for them to claim that radical Muslims don't celebrate terror and to claim Trump is a fraud and a kook is another inversion of reality.
[00:39:17.266 --> 00:39:20.848]  I know you're going to write an article on this today, boiling it all down, Paul.
[00:39:20.848 --> 00:39:23.089]  But super job on this Black Friday.
[00:39:23.089 --> 00:39:24.871]  Super job to Rob Duke.
[00:39:24.871 --> 00:39:28.433]  Rob Duke spent 60 seconds telling folks about the Black Friday specials.
[00:39:28.433 --> 00:39:32.136]  Then we'll go to this lawyer who's fighting for free speech in Canada.
[00:39:32.136 --> 00:39:32.896]  It's here.
[00:39:32.896 --> 00:39:34.057]  They're coming for our free speech.
[00:39:34.377 --> 00:39:35.314]  By Ford Illusion.
[00:39:37.281 --> 00:39:38.061]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:39:38.061 --> 00:39:43.564]  And one thing that I want to point out, the $9.95 special for Silver Bullet.
[00:39:43.564 --> 00:39:48.287]  If you don't have Silver Bullet in your medicine cabinet, I don't know what you're thinking.
[00:39:48.287 --> 00:39:53.270]  I use it, right now we've got a couple of the kids with stuffed up noses.
[00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:56.912]  Shoot a little Silver Bullet up the nose, blow it out.
[00:39:56.912 --> 00:40:01.414]  I mean, it's an amazing, amazing product for my family.
[00:40:01.414 --> 00:40:03.856]  And right now it's $9.95 and we're free shipping.
[00:40:04.736 --> 00:40:06.517]  You're never going to see a better price than that.
[00:40:06.517 --> 00:40:08.878]  I can't believe that it's that low.
[00:40:08.878 --> 00:40:11.359]  Plus, we've got some scorable food specials for the next 24 hours.
[00:40:11.359 --> 00:40:13.540]  Secret 12, 30% off.
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:17.481]  We've also got some 99-cent DVDs if you really want to educate some people out there in your life.
[00:40:17.481 --> 00:40:20.122]  Follow the Republic, in-game, Reflections and Warnings.
[00:40:20.122 --> 00:40:26.825]  That's with Aaron Russo, who talks about the whole microchip society that has been predicted by the Rockefellers.
[00:40:27.245 --> 00:40:28.826]  And how they're going to circumvent it.
[00:40:28.826 --> 00:40:30.927]  Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:40:30.927 --> 00:40:37.171]  I also have 25% off Supermail Vitality, 30% off Brain Force, 25% off ProPure units.
[00:40:37.171 --> 00:40:40.053]  So if you want to get some water filters, clean water in your life.
[00:40:40.053 --> 00:40:42.855]  Also, 33% off DNA Force.
[00:40:42.855 --> 00:40:44.336]  I mean, we've got amazing specials.
[00:40:44.336 --> 00:40:46.077]  Go to InfowarsStore.com.
[00:40:46.077 --> 00:40:48.258]  You can check out the new store that we've launched.
[00:40:48.258 --> 00:40:50.140]  We launched it, I guess, late last week.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.741]  And the feedback has been great.
[00:40:52.741 --> 00:40:54.702]  It's really intuitive.
[00:40:54.702 --> 00:40:58.705]  It's a lot quicker than our old store.
[00:40:58.705 --> 00:41:01.646]  Our old store is still there, too, if you still like shopping in the old store.
[00:41:01.646 --> 00:41:03.027]  But check out the new store.
[00:41:03.027 --> 00:41:04.168]  Give it a try.
[00:41:04.168 --> 00:41:07.930]  And check out some of these deals we have, especially that $9.95 Silver Bullet.
[00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:10.792]  We also have free shipping store-wide.
[00:41:10.792 --> 00:41:12.473]  So don't forget that.
[00:41:12.473 --> 00:41:14.073]  And with that, I will throw it back to Paul.
[00:41:14.073 --> 00:41:15.134]  But let me just say this.
[00:41:15.134 --> 00:41:16.475]  If you guys have my computer pulled up,
[00:41:16.935 --> 00:41:33.590]  Here's from at Conspiracy Watch, nothing says I love you like cheap crap made in China by slave labor sold by a company owned by billionaires benefiting from corporate welfare paying slave wages to employees kept from enjoying Thanksgiving with their families.
[00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:36.633]  And I think that kind of sums it up what's going on in Black Friday.
[00:41:36.633 --> 00:41:40.356]  We are offering you real deals here at InfowarsStore.com and we thank you for your support.
[00:41:40.356 --> 00:41:42.778]  Without your support we would not be here right now.
[00:41:42.778 --> 00:41:43.719]  So back to you Paul.
[00:41:44.841 --> 00:41:49.584]  Okay, thanks Rob and Alex, and we're going to go to our guest now, and I thank him for holding.
[00:41:49.584 --> 00:41:52.726]  This was a story that came to my attention probably back in July.
[00:41:52.726 --> 00:41:57.448]  I think it was Christine Blatchford out of the National Post in Canada.
[00:41:57.448 --> 00:41:59.630]  She made a video about this trial.
[00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:00.911]  I uploaded her comments.
[00:42:00.911 --> 00:42:03.992]  It ended up getting about 600,000 views on YouTube.
[00:42:03.992 --> 00:42:06.374]  It was viral, basically, at the time.
[00:42:07.338 --> 00:42:21.268]  And it was pertaining to an artist out of Toronto called Gregory Alan Elliot, who faced, at the time, and we'll get an update and see if it's the same situation now, six months in prison for harassment.
[00:42:21.268 --> 00:42:25.551]  His crime was apparently disagreeing with feminists on Twitter.
[00:42:25.551 --> 00:42:28.793]  And at first it was like, this is, you know, this is too shocking to be true.
[00:42:29.413 --> 00:42:32.196]  Surely he made some kind of violent threat against them.
[00:42:32.196 --> 00:42:36.600]  Surely he just didn't disagree with them on their politics.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:42.126]  But I actually drilled down into the tweets into what Mr. Elliott said and that's exactly how it appeared.
[00:42:42.126 --> 00:42:49.153]  It appeared as if he was being charged with a crime of harassment simply for disagreeing with someone's political opinion.
[00:42:49.793 --> 00:43:01.461]  But here to tell us more about this and how it has massive implications for free speech, not just in Canada, but on the internet as a whole, is Christopher Murphy, the lawyer for Gregory Alan Elliot.
[00:43:01.461 --> 00:43:03.382]  Christopher, welcome to the show.
[00:43:03.382 --> 00:43:05.324]  Thank you, Paul.
[00:43:05.324 --> 00:43:06.625]  Good to have you here.
[00:43:06.625 --> 00:43:06.765]  Now,
[00:43:07.603 --> 00:43:10.364]  This began, as far as I can remember, back in 2012.
[00:43:10.364 --> 00:43:17.525]  So, for the audience, explain how it began and what led to this charge of criminal harassment against Mr. Elliott.
[00:43:17.525 --> 00:43:17.865]  Sure.
[00:43:17.865 --> 00:43:28.888]  So, in November of 2012, the police came to Mr. Elliott's house in Toronto, Ontario, and essentially asked him to turn himself in.
[00:43:28.888 --> 00:43:33.829]  Mr. Elliott, my understanding was, at the time, did not know the reason for the police's visit.
[00:43:36.099 --> 00:43:50.504]  Mr. Elliott attended at the police detachment and he was placed under arrest at that point for criminally harassing a single complainant named Stephanie Guthrie.
[00:43:50.504 --> 00:43:59.507]  And so he was held in custody at that point and was taken the following day to the courthouse for a bail hearing.
[00:44:00.439 --> 00:44:13.896]  At the bail hearing, the prosecutor tendered essentially what I would describe as the most inflammatory tweets that Mr. Guthrie had sent on Twitter.
[00:44:13.896 --> 00:44:17.100]  They had nothing to do, actually, with the complainant in the case.
[00:44:19.483 --> 00:44:23.526]  Mr. Elliott, I think, had sent approximately 50,000 tweets by that point.
[00:44:23.526 --> 00:44:40.037]  So just randomly plucked out of those 50,000 tweets the worst tweets, and of course they weren't in any kind of context whatsoever, so the justice of the peace who was hearing the bail hearing would have no idea to whom these tweets had been sent and what the context was.
[00:44:40.037 --> 00:44:47.242]  And the Crown sought Mr. Elliott's detention, which means that Mr. Elliott would have sat in jail waiting for his trial.
[00:44:48.062 --> 00:44:55.069]  So they wanted to deny him bail, even though he put over some tweets when he obviously wasn't even a threat to anyone, right?
[00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.689]  Right, yes.
[00:44:55.689 --> 00:45:00.974]  So he actually spent three days in custody waiting for this bail hearing to be reached.
[00:45:00.974 --> 00:45:06.760]  And then the Crown sought to detain him, so not give him bail until his trial.
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.781]  And his trial is still ongoing, it's three years later.
[00:45:10.603 --> 00:45:13.485]  It's coming down on January 22nd, 2016.
[00:45:13.485 --> 00:45:27.895]  So once Mr. Elliott got bail back in November 2012, two further complainants came forward and Mr. Elliott was eventually charged with criminally harassing three individuals.
[00:45:29.035 --> 00:45:36.498]  Each of whom was extremely active in a Toronto political organization called Women in Toronto Politics.
[00:45:36.498 --> 00:45:37.618]  The original complainant, Ms.
[00:45:37.618 --> 00:45:41.060]  Guthrie, was actually the founder of this political organization.
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:48.222]  And so, the trial lasted, I think it was 15 actual court days.
[00:45:48.222 --> 00:45:50.223]  That's just the evidence portion.
[00:45:50.223 --> 00:45:54.204]  I've done two murder trials that took less time, and I'm not exaggerating.
[00:45:56.673 --> 00:45:59.955]  And then there are applications that were brought.
[00:45:59.955 --> 00:46:05.157]  I believe there are 18 or 19 total court days spent on this case.
[00:46:05.157 --> 00:46:21.425]  And at the end of the day, what the defense's position was, clearly, was that Mr. Elliott, and this was admitted by the officer in charge of the case and the Crown Attorney, the prosecutor, Mr. Elliott had never sent a tweet that was threatening in nature.
[00:46:22.563 --> 00:46:28.105]  Mr. Elliott never used any sexualized language with the three complainants.
[00:46:28.105 --> 00:46:43.150]  And Mr. Elliott had never seen any of the three complainants in person except on one occasion when, months before the alleged transgressions occurred, Mr. Elliott was actually volunteering as an artist.
[00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:45.350]  He volunteered to make posters for Ms.
[00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:46.711]  Guthrie's political organization.
[00:46:47.231 --> 00:46:53.216]  Right, so he was actually helping the feminists with their cause in the beginning and they turned against him.
[00:46:53.216 --> 00:46:57.580]  And then the other thing is this video game, this was part of it, wasn't it?
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:04.886]  Because there was an individual who made an online video game based around punching Anita Sarkeesian, who is a prominent feminist.
[00:47:05.806 --> 00:47:08.189]  In the face, in this online video game.
[00:47:08.189 --> 00:47:08.670]  That's right.
[00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:17.740]  So feminists, as far as I understand it now, you know, the complainants against Mr. Elliott, they basically wanted to wreck this young kid's life.
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.022]  Elliott complained about that.
[00:47:19.022 --> 00:47:23.147]  He said it probably wasn't the best course of action and that's part of the case, correct?
[00:47:23.607 --> 00:47:25.989]  Yes, so now I can take you through the timeline.
[00:47:25.989 --> 00:47:31.293]  So Mr. Elliott is charged with criminally harassing the three complainants from August 1st, 2012, essentially until November 16th, 2012.
[00:47:39.161 --> 00:47:42.662]  From April, the time that Mr. Elliott met with Ms.
[00:47:42.662 --> 00:47:53.025]  Guthrie to provide art for her organization, from April to July, there are a number of tweets that were in evidence and they're both on each other at the same side.
[00:47:53.025 --> 00:47:56.426]  They're both helping one another out.
[00:47:56.426 --> 00:47:59.867]  Mr. Elliott's clearly a booster for this organization.
[00:48:00.367 --> 00:48:04.973]  He's attempting to get other women to join the organization at one point.
[00:48:04.973 --> 00:48:12.501]  At one point, he takes a female friend of his to one of their functions to get her involved, right?
[00:48:12.501 --> 00:48:17.547]  So he's involved with the organization to a limited degree, but he's clearly a booster of it.
[00:48:18.408 --> 00:48:24.876]  Then in July of 2012, this person, this is a small town in Northern Ontario called Sault Ste.
[00:48:24.876 --> 00:48:25.858]  Marie.
[00:48:25.858 --> 00:48:30.183]  So there's a 24-year-old kid named Bendelon Spur up in Sault Ste.
[00:48:30.183 --> 00:48:36.611]  Marie, Ontario, who had, I think at the time, he had something like six or eight Twitter followers.
[00:48:37.492 --> 00:48:50.211]  He makes this face punch game wherein if you hit the space bar on your computer, there would be a simulation of Anita Sarkeesian being punched in the face.
[00:48:50.905 --> 00:48:53.947]  Now, this is not the first face punch game this young man had made.
[00:48:53.947 --> 00:49:01.050]  He'd made one about a male just a few months earlier, but didn't get really any media attention or any attention at all.
[00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:10.855]  So, he makes this Anita Sarkeesian face punch game, and you know, I mean, I certainly wouldn't advocate people doing that, but to each his own.
[00:49:12.956 --> 00:49:14.337]  So, at that point, Ms.
[00:49:14.337 --> 00:49:24.763]  Guthrie does some investigative legwork and tracks down who this person is, his real name, in Sault Ste.
[00:49:24.763 --> 00:49:26.704]  Marie, this small town.
[00:49:26.704 --> 00:49:28.845]  So, what happens at that point is Ms.
[00:49:28.845 --> 00:49:41.393]  Guthrie, who is, again, the founder of this political organization, literally asks her followers whether or not she should sic the internet on this Mr. Spur.
[00:49:42.682 --> 00:49:47.746]  And she indicated that the overwhelming response was yes.
[00:49:47.746 --> 00:49:54.192]  So at that point, she does, this is the defense's position, does attempt to sic the internet on Mr. Spurr.
[00:49:55.851 --> 00:50:03.375]  And the course that that took was Mr. Spurr, actually, the local newspapers were contacted.
[00:50:03.375 --> 00:50:09.699]  There were a number of suggestions that people should not hire Mr. Spurr for any work.
[00:50:09.699 --> 00:50:10.359]  And Ms.
[00:50:10.359 --> 00:50:21.085]  Guthrie testified at the trial that she was attempting to have real world consequences visited upon Mr. Spurr for making this face punch game.
[00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:30.810]  In other words, they were trying to ruin his life as they're now trying to ruin Mr. Elliott's life and indeed have done over the past couple of years or so.
[00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:37.054]  We're going to get more into it after the break with Christopher Murphy and we're going to explain why this is so crucial.
[00:50:37.054 --> 00:50:49.201]  This is not just a Canadian issue, this is an internet free speech issue because now we have top feminists getting in front of UN panels and basically making the same argument that harassment
[00:50:50.181 --> 00:50:52.403]  ...is disagreeing with them on the internet.
[00:50:52.403 --> 00:50:54.564]  That's what they actually want to create as the precedent.
[00:50:54.564 --> 00:50:56.165]  We'll get more into it after the break.
[00:50:56.165 --> 00:50:57.986]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.

[00:54:09.266 --> 00:54:22.448]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show with me, your host, Paul Joseph Watson, and we're talking to Christopher Murphy, who is the lawyer for Gregory Alan Elliot, who faces six months in jail in Canada for, quote, criminal harassment.
[00:54:23.513 --> 00:54:27.777]  Which is in fact sending tweets to feminists disagreeing with them.
[00:54:27.777 --> 00:54:29.098]  Why is this important?
[00:54:29.098 --> 00:54:44.631]  Well, as I made a video about a couple of months ago, Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe Quinn, who are two prominent feminists on YouTube, on the internet, they got up in front of this UN panel and basically tried to make the argument that saying, you suck,
[00:54:45.311 --> 00:55:04.029]  Those are the words that Anita Sarkeesian used saying you suck to a feminist on Twitter constitutes quote cyber violence and that the UN should put pressure on national governments to then put pressure on ISPs to censor people to kick people off the internet for saying this.
[00:55:04.029 --> 00:55:09.034]  Another example given by Quinn was calling Caitlyn Jenner Bruce
[00:55:09.614 --> 00:55:22.730]  She said that people who call transgender people by their pre-transition names should be put under this same category of having committed cyber violence and basically be censored and kicked off the internet.
[00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:24.832]  Now we have this trial in Canada.
[00:55:24.832 --> 00:55:25.893]  So we've basically got
[00:55:26.806 --> 00:55:35.853]  This young kid who had his life ruined by these feminists, or they attempted to ruin his life, because he made a simulated face punch game.
[00:55:35.853 --> 00:55:51.904]  So then an artist from Toronto, Gregory Allen Elliott, who had been friendly with these feminists and tried to work with them before, basically came forward and tried to defend this kid, said that it's probably not the best idea to ruin his life over an online video game.
[00:55:51.904 --> 00:55:54.006]  Christopher Murphy, pick up the story for us.
[00:55:54.525 --> 00:56:03.049]  Right, so yeah, so just before the break, so what happened was Miss Guthrie, the complainant, asked if she should stick the internet on Mr. Spurr.
[00:56:03.049 --> 00:56:04.829]  There was an overwhelming response.
[00:56:04.829 --> 00:56:06.570]  She says that was yes.
[00:56:06.570 --> 00:56:21.036]  So then Mr. Elliott, as the tweets started piling on Mr. Spurr, this young kid up north in Ontario, Mr. Elliott said, listen, and these are the tweets that he sent out essentially, he said, listen, if this guy ends up killing himself,
[00:56:21.656 --> 00:56:29.438]  This is going to do serious damage to this feminist political organization because there's going to be some blowback.
[00:56:29.438 --> 00:56:33.539]  So that's when the relationship started to go south.
[00:56:33.539 --> 00:56:36.500]  And that was in July of 2012.
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:38.941]  So now we fast forward to August 2012.
[00:56:38.941 --> 00:56:48.584]  Now Mr. Elliott is being bombarded by a number of different people who, in my submission, were close to this
[00:56:50.164 --> 00:56:55.187]  The feminist political organization, including the complainants themselves.
[00:56:55.187 --> 00:57:02.611]  And he started, sometimes people in his position when they're getting bombarded, and I think the correct word is bullied.
[00:57:02.611 --> 00:57:03.812]  He was being bullied.
[00:57:03.812 --> 00:57:06.093]  Sometimes the bullies just backed out.
[00:57:06.093 --> 00:57:07.514]  But Mr. Elliott didn't.
[00:57:07.514 --> 00:57:09.915]  So he defended himself.
[00:57:09.915 --> 00:57:11.556]  He wrote back to the bullies.
[00:57:12.376 --> 00:57:15.937]  And he would tweet about their political comments.
[00:57:15.937 --> 00:57:27.319]  So if they made a political statement about the slut walk, for instance, Mr. Elliott would tweet a very politically valid point.
[00:57:27.319 --> 00:57:29.099]  And so the tweets are going back and forth.
[00:57:29.099 --> 00:57:31.539]  This wasn't a one-sided thing.
[00:57:31.539 --> 00:57:40.421]  And what really was important is that when the complainants came forward to the police, eventually in November of 2012, they brought in a selected portion of tweets.
[00:57:41.161 --> 00:57:45.363]  The police go out, arrest Mr. Elliott, try to keep him in jail.
[00:57:45.363 --> 00:57:56.649]  It wasn't until his trial in 2013, or sorry, 2014, that the other tweets that they were sending out about Mr. Elliott came to light.
[00:57:56.649 --> 00:58:00.972]  And so there is some terrible types of tweets that were being sent about him, just making fun of him.
[00:58:02.032 --> 00:58:03.213]  I think so.
[00:58:17.208 --> 00:58:19.128]  Is Mr. Elliott, in your view, Ms.
[00:58:19.128 --> 00:58:23.769]  Guthrie, allowed to defend himself against all of your tweets?
[00:58:23.769 --> 00:58:31.371]  And she said something to the effect of, he's allowed to defend himself, he's just not allowed to defend himself to me.
[00:58:31.371 --> 00:58:33.631]  Okay, we'll get back to it with more after the break.

[01:00:07.925 --> 01:00:09.686]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.686 --> 01:00:11.266]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.266 --> 01:00:12.827]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.827 --> 01:00:17.008]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.008 --> 01:00:24.551]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.551 --> 01:00:29.853]  We're back, second now of the Alex Jones Show Live, this Friday, 27th of November edition.
[01:00:30.493 --> 01:00:39.397]  We're talking to Christopher Murphy, the lawyer for Gregory Ellen Elliott, who of course faces jail time in Canada for disagreeing with a feminist on Twitter.
[01:00:39.397 --> 01:00:42.959]  So we have these feminists who, again, they're cry-bullies.
[01:00:42.959 --> 01:00:45.680]  This is the new term that's being coined for these kind of people.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:51.622]  These feminists and social justice warriors who alternate between playing the victim and playing the aggressor.
[01:00:51.622 --> 01:00:57.185]  So they've already publicly shamed this young man for making an online video game simulation.
[01:00:57.865 --> 01:01:03.248]  Now they go after Gregory Allen Elliott for trying to defend him.
[01:01:03.248 --> 01:01:17.256]  Mr. Murphy, isn't it the case, this is what I read, that they actually, as part of this public shaming campaign, they tried to frame him as a paedophile, or at least that was in the works as one of the ideas to publicly shame Mr. Elliott, correct?
[01:01:17.256 --> 01:01:25.980]  Well, so what happened is, this is now later in November of 2012, Mr. Elliott literally has not sent a tweet about any of the complaints for over a month.
[01:01:29.339 --> 01:01:35.100]  A woman in Toronto tweets something to the effect of, I've got a 100 square foot apartment.
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:38.681]  Mr. Elliott writes back to her, I'd like to see it sometime.
[01:01:38.681 --> 01:01:45.643]  She writes back something to the effect of, screw you, I'm 13 years old, you're a pedophile.
[01:01:45.643 --> 01:01:46.343]  Okay?
[01:01:46.343 --> 01:01:49.644]  So, that had nothing to do with the complainants.
[01:01:49.644 --> 01:01:55.265]  But the complainants somehow became aware of this series of tweets very quickly, within minutes.
[01:01:55.865 --> 01:02:00.268]  And all of a sudden, they started, to one of the complainants, Ms.
[01:02:00.268 --> 01:02:14.658]  Guthrie didn't actually send the tweet out herself, but contributed to some of the conversation, sent out a tweet wherein Mr. Elias identified as a pedophile, and that starts going viral, okay?
[01:02:14.658 --> 01:02:23.885]  Now what happens is then, within an hour of that, they find out that this person was not actually a minor, but was an adult.
[01:02:24.861 --> 01:02:27.582]  But they don't do anything to correct the record.
[01:02:27.582 --> 01:02:41.447]  And in fact, when they come into the police a few days later with the select tweets, bring in the pedophilia tweets and give them to the police, even though they knew by that point this person was an adult.
[01:02:41.447 --> 01:02:47.670]  And Mr. Elliott, of course, attempts to defend himself against these pedophilia accusations.
[01:02:48.752 --> 01:03:01.578]  And those tweets wherein he's defending himself against false pedophilia accusations were tenured by the prosecution at Mr. Elliott's trial as evidence that he was criminally harassing the complainants.
[01:03:01.578 --> 01:03:02.938]  And I'm not making that up.
[01:03:02.938 --> 01:03:09.021]  So defending yourself against charges, fake charges of pedophilia, now constitutes harassment?
[01:03:10.438 --> 01:03:11.919]  That's completely ridiculous.
[01:03:11.919 --> 01:03:18.384]  They were part of the prosecution's case that Mr. Elliott was contacting the complainants.
[01:03:18.384 --> 01:03:23.428]  And obviously he was contacting the complainants to say, listen, I'm not a pedophile.
[01:03:23.428 --> 01:03:25.870]  And he was merely tagging them in the tweets, correct?
[01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:27.611]  Yes, exactly, yes.
[01:03:27.611 --> 01:03:32.615]  He wasn't mailing them, he wasn't calling them up on the phone, he was tagging them in a tweet, for God's sake.
[01:03:32.615 --> 01:03:33.476]  Yes, exactly.
[01:03:34.196 --> 01:03:49.534]  And so the precedent, from what I understand it, they're trying to create this precedent where if you, as a feminist or as whoever, fear for your safety, that that constitutes proof that someone is threatening your safety if you just merely claim it, correct?
[01:03:50.074 --> 01:03:55.437]  Well, yeah, I mean, I believe that somebody can be criminally harassed on Twitter.
[01:03:55.437 --> 01:04:13.449]  So, Paul, if I, for instance, were sending a tweet out every few minutes tracking your location and telling the internet what you're wearing, then whenever you go out of your house, you might look over your shoulder wondering whether or not this person is following you, and you might ultimately feel fearful about that.
[01:04:13.929 --> 01:04:20.356]  So I don't think that it's impossible to criminally harass somebody on Twitter, but that's not the case for Mr. Elliott.
[01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:24.581]  He had never seen these people, other than the one dinner six months earlier.
[01:04:24.581 --> 01:04:29.026]  He never indicated that he was watching them.
[01:04:29.026 --> 01:04:32.189]  This was just political dialogue on Twitter.
[01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:42.555]  And everyone obviously follows, they're subject to the rules on Twitter, and actually one of the complainants asked Twitter to suspend Mr. Elliott's account.
[01:04:42.555 --> 01:04:44.796]  Twitter wrote back and said, forget it.
[01:04:44.796 --> 01:04:52.280]  The examples you've provided us do not violate the Twitter rules, and in fact, the examples you've provided us show us that it's a two-way conversation.
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:52.900]  Amazing.
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:53.881]  Welcome back.
[01:04:53.881 --> 01:04:56.142]  Long segment with Christopher Murphy after the break.
[01:04:56.142 --> 01:04:57.723]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[01:04:57.723 --> 01:04:58.323]  Don't go away.
[01:04:58.817 --> 01:04:59.457]  The D.C.
[01:04:59.457 --> 01:05:04.460]  Police Chief urges citizens to fight back against Paris-style attackers.
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:07.802]  Speaking with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Washington, D.C.
[01:05:07.802 --> 01:05:18.087]  Police Chief Kathy Lanier urged residents to do what's necessary to save lives in the event of a terror attack or mass shooting, whether it means run, hide, or fight.
[01:05:18.087 --> 01:05:24.831]  If you're in a position to try to take the gunman out, it's the best option for saving lives before police can get there, Lanier said.
[01:05:25.071 --> 01:05:38.757]  While acknowledging her latest suggestion was counterintuitive to previous tactics the police have advised, Lanier claimed that taking action may be essential to prevent another massacre like the attack in Paris, which left over 120 people dead.
[01:05:38.757 --> 01:05:41.238]  We always tell people, don't take action.
[01:05:41.238 --> 01:05:42.338]  Call 911.
[01:05:42.338 --> 01:05:44.799]  Don't intervene in the robbery, Lanier said.
[01:05:44.799 --> 01:05:46.960]  We've never told people, take action.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.901]  But, it's a different scenario.

[01:07:01.832 --> 01:07:11.556]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:07:11.556 --> 01:07:14.257]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:07:14.257 --> 01:07:17.799]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:07:17.799 --> 01:07:20.540]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:21.480]  We're good to go.
[01:07:43.368 --> 01:07:50.935]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:07:58.022 --> 01:08:03.988]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.988 --> 01:08:06.790]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.810 --> 01:08:14.678]  Yeah.
[01:08:21.067 --> 01:08:28.413]  We're back live from the Alex Jones Show, Black Friday edition, talking to Christopher Murphy, the lawyer for Gregory Allen Elliott.
[01:08:28.413 --> 01:08:34.098]  And this case is crucial, and yet it's had relatively little mainstream media attention.
[01:08:34.098 --> 01:08:38.161]  I know Christine Blatchford with the National Post has been covering it.
[01:08:38.161 --> 01:08:49.551]  Apart from that, there's not really a lot of information out there in the mainstream media about this case, despite the fact that it could have fundamental implications for free speech on the internet.
[01:08:50.211 --> 01:09:08.920]  And again, before the break we were talking about the definition of harassment, what these feminists were claiming constituted harassment, was Mr. Elliott defending himself against accusations, false accusations of paedophilia, and tagging them in tweets, simply tagging their name in tweets, no direct contact whatsoever.
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:11.521]  They used that, they said that was harassment.
[01:09:11.521 --> 01:09:13.902]  So, Mr. Murphy, pick up the story.
[01:09:13.902 --> 01:09:17.724]  At what point was Mr. Elliott banned from using the internet entirely?
[01:09:18.641 --> 01:09:23.765]  So one of his bail conditions were that he was not able to use the internet.
[01:09:23.765 --> 01:09:36.194]  So you have to appreciate that at his bail hearing, the evidence that was led was kind of one-sided because the complainants had brought in just a select number of tweets and
[01:09:36.934 --> 01:09:42.898]  Because Mr. Elliott was in custody, we weren't able to access the remaining number of tweets.
[01:09:42.898 --> 01:09:46.760]  We accessed some of them for the bail hearing, but not all of them, obviously.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:51.203]  And so, one of his bail conditions was that he could not access the internet.
[01:09:51.203 --> 01:09:54.265]  That ended up being changed a couple years later.
[01:09:54.265 --> 01:10:02.250]  In Canada, anyway, you have to get the prosecution's consent to change bail conditions.
[01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:08.174]  Unless you go to Superior Court and bring what's a relatively expensive application.
[01:10:08.174 --> 01:10:09.655]  So that wasn't done.
[01:10:09.655 --> 01:10:19.001]  We had to ultimately get the prosecution to consent to change the bail conditions to allow him to use the internet for... Because he's an artist, right?
[01:10:19.001 --> 01:10:21.283]  He can't promote his book without the internet.
[01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:21.843]  Right, yes.
[01:10:21.843 --> 01:10:31.810]  So about a year and a half, two years later, he was allowed to use the internet for work and to mount a defense for his trial.
[01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:32.311]  And that was it.
[01:10:34.577 --> 01:10:37.558]  So he couldn't use social media, basically?
[01:10:37.558 --> 01:10:44.641]  Oh no, he's still not, to this day, he's still not permitted to use social media until the judgement comes down on January 22nd.
[01:10:44.641 --> 01:10:46.322]  Amazing.
[01:10:46.322 --> 01:10:50.764]  Then there's this other aspect to this, I don't know whether this is true or not, this is what I read.
[01:10:52.119 --> 01:11:01.323]  Supposedly, there was some evidence uncovered of one of Elliot's accusers, I don't know which one, being friendly with someone within the Toronto Police Department.
[01:11:01.323 --> 01:11:05.605]  Do you think that that, if true, had any impact on his treatment?
[01:11:05.605 --> 01:11:06.285]  I don't know.
[01:11:06.285 --> 01:11:10.828]  So, I've heard some rumblings about that as well.
[01:11:10.828 --> 01:11:18.111]  There was a third complainant that was named just after Mr. Elliot's bail hearing.
[01:11:18.111 --> 01:11:19.792]  The Crown withdrew
[01:11:21.041 --> 01:11:23.262]  The charge against Mr. Elliott in relation to her.
[01:11:23.262 --> 01:11:25.604]  So she never got called as a witness.
[01:11:25.604 --> 01:11:26.764]  So I don't know.
[01:11:26.764 --> 01:11:32.488]  I don't know the reason why the prosecution withdrew the charge against that individual.
[01:11:34.294 --> 01:11:42.740]  So, obviously, if she would have been called as a witness, she would have been subjected to cross-examination by me on some of those points you just mentioned.
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:48.664]  But I never got to cross-examine her because that charge was dropped just before she was supposed to testify.
[01:11:48.664 --> 01:11:49.324]  So I don't know.
[01:11:49.324 --> 01:11:51.466]  I don't know the answers to that question.
[01:11:52.947 --> 01:11:56.713]  So this starts to get real media attention this summer.
[01:11:56.713 --> 01:12:00.098]  It was the first time I heard about it and most people heard about it.
[01:12:00.098 --> 01:12:03.863]  Then a couple of months later we had this incident at the coffee shop.
[01:12:03.863 --> 01:12:04.904]  Tell us what happened there.
[01:12:05.464 --> 01:12:09.268]  Right, so this is just about a month ago.
[01:12:09.268 --> 01:12:16.016]  So Mr. Elliott, he's an artist, and so he frequents this area of Toronto.
[01:12:16.016 --> 01:12:22.864]  It's kind of a hippie neighborhood, lots of public markets, coffee shops.
[01:12:22.864 --> 01:12:25.426]  He's been frequenting that neighborhood for years.
[01:12:26.804 --> 01:12:28.565]  He hangs some of his art.
[01:12:28.565 --> 01:12:29.926]  And the art, it's not paintings.
[01:12:29.926 --> 01:12:32.267]  These were just statements.
[01:12:32.267 --> 01:12:38.171]  I believe one of them related to the Court of Public Opinion, one of the pieces of art.
[01:12:38.171 --> 01:12:49.938]  So a woman comes into the coffee shop and orders a cup of coffee, turns around and throws the coffee on two of Mr. Elliott's posters.
[01:12:51.326 --> 01:12:55.089]  And this is after, sorry, I kind of stepped ahead.
[01:12:55.089 --> 01:13:14.005]  This is after there had been a backlash against the coffee shop on Twitter and on Facebook, basically demanding that this art be taken off the walls because it made the environment unsafe for women to attend.
[01:13:15.443 --> 01:13:19.528]  And it wasn't even anti-feminist or anything, right?
[01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:20.509]  No, no, no.
[01:13:20.509 --> 01:13:26.696]  There's nothing in the posters that could be construed in any way to be anti-feminist or threatening.
[01:13:26.696 --> 01:13:27.738]  Nothing.
[01:13:27.738 --> 01:13:32.022]  And so the coffee shop wrote a very reasoned response on Facebook.
[01:13:32.603 --> 01:13:37.166]  Saying essentially, listen, Mr. Elliott is innocent until proven guilty.
[01:13:37.166 --> 01:13:38.467]  He's an artist.
[01:13:38.467 --> 01:13:43.249]  We are not going to censure artists because they've got some charges against them.
[01:13:43.249 --> 01:13:50.074]  And then a couple days after that, a woman comes in, throws the coffee on the art, and I would have thought,
[01:13:50.974 --> 01:13:59.021]  That would have been received negatively by the people who have been kind of bullying Mr. Elliott all along, but the opposite was true.
[01:13:59.021 --> 01:14:07.808]  This was a criminal offense that this person committed by throwing the coffee on the artwork, the offense of mischief.
[01:14:07.808 --> 01:14:13.453]  This was being trumpeted afterwards as some sort of accomplishment that
[01:14:14.958 --> 01:14:20.062]  Committing a criminal offense defacing an artist's work was somehow a good thing.
[01:14:20.062 --> 01:14:26.966]  And that, to me, that was when, for me, I just decided this whole thing is just ridiculous.
[01:14:26.966 --> 01:14:40.196]  Because if this is what is lauded on the internet, and Mr. Elliott expressing his right to... In Canada, there's a constitutional right to freedom of expression, much like there is in the United States.
[01:14:40.896 --> 01:14:48.223]  Mr. Elliott is discussing political opinions on the Internet, some of which he agrees with, some of which he doesn't.
[01:14:48.223 --> 01:14:56.070]  He gets charged criminally for that, but a person who goes in and commits a criminal offense by defacing an artist's work is lauded on the Internet.
[01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:58.853]  And it just says, up is down, black is white.
[01:15:00.234 --> 01:15:05.495]  And again, it goes to the point, I mean, we saw it with Protein World, those ads being defaced.
[01:15:05.495 --> 01:15:11.197]  Of course, the company simply used it to their advantage and made millions more as a result.
[01:15:11.197 --> 01:15:14.118]  But again, it's the intolerance of free expression.
[01:15:14.118 --> 01:15:17.999]  This artwork couldn't even be construed as offensive to anyone.
[01:15:17.999 --> 01:15:22.700]  Like that was, you know, something to consider in the first place.
[01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:27.441]  What was offensive to this group was the fact that his name was on the bottom of it.
[01:15:27.941 --> 01:15:41.410]  That's what made it unsafe for them to go into this coffee shop because Gregory Alan Elliot's name was literally written on the bottom of his own artwork and so therefore you can't go into that coffee shop because you feel unsafe.
[01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:51.777]  Right, and because it was basically him standing up for himself and saying you can't ruin my entire life, you can't ruin my, you know, my career with these public shaming tactics.
[01:15:51.777 --> 01:15:56.260]  They didn't like that and so they went, as they did with Protein World, and defaced the artwork.
[01:15:56.986 --> 01:15:57.927]  Let's finish up.
[01:15:57.927 --> 01:16:07.672]  Let's talk about how we can help with the crowdfunding, but what will the consequences potentially be for free speech on the internet if Mr. Elliott is found guilty?
[01:16:07.672 --> 01:16:15.837]  I personally believe that if Mr. Elliott is found guilty, there could be significant consequences because like I said before, he didn't do anything that was threatening.
[01:16:16.863 --> 01:16:20.386]  There are a lot of threats made on the internet that don't go investigated by the police.
[01:16:20.386 --> 01:16:21.407]  Death threats.
[01:16:21.407 --> 01:16:22.648]  Those should be investigated.
[01:16:22.648 --> 01:16:28.854]  If you threaten to kill somebody on Twitter, you should expect the police to knock on your door and arrest you for threatening to kill somebody.
[01:16:28.854 --> 01:16:32.758]  But if Mr. Elliott is convicted for
[01:16:34.059 --> 01:16:42.781]  Defending himself, A, and commenting on someone else's politics, B, then people have got to be very careful about what they say.
[01:16:42.781 --> 01:16:47.222]  And then if you're very careful about what you say, all of a sudden you're censuring yourself.
[01:16:47.222 --> 01:16:50.463]  You're not able to freely express your own opinions.
[01:16:50.463 --> 01:16:55.664]  And then that starts to detract away from what Canada and the U.S.
[01:16:55.664 --> 01:16:56.684]  is supposed to be all about.
[01:16:57.384 --> 01:17:10.335]  So I think it can have a very significant impact because people who express their opinions without threatening can now be subject to criminal prosecution.
[01:17:10.335 --> 01:17:12.217]  And that's a very scary concept.
[01:17:13.769 --> 01:17:16.191]  And that's why people should be up in arms about this.
[01:17:16.191 --> 01:17:24.756]  Tell us about how people can donate to the crowdfunding campaign for Mr. Elliott, because this has run up a hundred grand bill so far, right?
[01:17:24.756 --> 01:17:25.076]  Right.
[01:17:25.076 --> 01:17:28.758]  You know, I don't actually know much about the crowdfunding campaign.
[01:17:28.758 --> 01:17:33.161]  I'm not involved in that, so I don't believe I can give you any answers to that.
[01:17:33.161 --> 01:17:34.382]  I'm sorry.
[01:17:34.382 --> 01:17:36.743]  I know that there is a crowdfunding... That's fine.
[01:17:36.743 --> 01:17:37.664]  I've got a link.
[01:17:37.664 --> 01:17:39.305]  I'm going to put a link up on Twitter.
[01:17:39.705 --> 01:17:40.406]  Well, I think that
[01:17:59.389 --> 01:18:09.175]  It's important that the public be made aware of these issues and that Mr. Elliott and people like him are stuck up for.
[01:18:09.175 --> 01:18:15.559]  Because, again, this is not something that I believe should be criminalized in any democratic country.
[01:18:16.479 --> 01:18:22.423]  And the more people that become aware of the facts of this case, the better from my perspective.
[01:18:22.423 --> 01:18:27.186]  Because the facts of this case are on Mr. Elliott's side.
[01:18:27.186 --> 01:18:32.590]  And if that could help Mr. Elliott get on with his life, then I think that's good.
[01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:37.813]  Because there has been a fair amount of media attention to this in Canada.
[01:18:39.674 --> 01:18:47.859]  A lot of the social media coming from the same complainants in this case and their group is very, very negative.
[01:18:47.859 --> 01:18:52.442]  And it's had a very detrimental effect on Mr. Elliott's life, his mental health.
[01:18:52.442 --> 01:18:53.603]  It's been three years now.
[01:18:53.603 --> 01:18:56.325]  He's been fighting this for over three years.
[01:18:56.325 --> 01:19:00.928]  And he hasn't worked since these charges were laid.
[01:19:00.928 --> 01:19:02.769]  It's had a real impact on his life.
[01:19:05.595 --> 01:19:07.956]  And this all comes to a head in January, correct?
[01:19:07.956 --> 01:19:12.819]  January 22nd, the judgment comes down, yes.
[01:19:12.819 --> 01:19:16.320]  Okay, we'll be sure to check in with updates as we get them.
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:19.322]  Christopher Murphy, thanks for joining us on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:19.322 --> 01:19:20.783]  Thank you for having me, Paul.
[01:19:20.783 --> 01:19:21.083]  Thank you.
[01:19:21.889 --> 01:19:23.871]  Again, everybody should be up in arms about this.
[01:19:23.871 --> 01:19:26.733]  Massive implications for free speech on the internet.
[01:19:26.733 --> 01:19:32.177]  This is what the radicals, the social justice warriors want, the regressive left.
[01:19:32.177 --> 01:19:41.603]  They want to silence and censor people for daring to disagree with them under the banner of cyber violence, under the banner of harassment.
[01:19:41.603 --> 01:19:46.007]  And if this court in Canada, which should have thrown out this ludicrous case within minutes,
[01:19:46.527 --> 01:19:49.693]  If it goes along with it, it's going to have massive implications.
[01:19:49.693 --> 01:19:52.578]  It's a massive threat to free speech on the internet.
[01:19:52.578 --> 01:19:56.525]  We'll be back with more news and CJ Pearson on the Alex Jones Show Live.
[01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:57.086]  Stay tuned.

[01:23:29.807 --> 01:23:35.249]  My buddy Mark, he overhears the management team at Guns80.com.
[01:23:35.249 --> 01:23:44.812]  And what they're saying is that between now and Black Friday, they're going to put a special on the website at Guns80.com every day.
[01:23:44.812 --> 01:23:52.795]  What that means is that you have to go to Guns80.com every day to check out the specials between now and Black Friday.
[01:23:52.795 --> 01:23:56.236]  Go to Guns80.com, but don't tell them you heard it from me.
[01:23:58.933 --> 01:24:00.918]  We're good.
[01:24:10.234 --> 01:24:13.875]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:13.875 --> 01:24:15.935]  I'm your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:24:15.935 --> 01:24:20.356]  Just tweeted out the link for you to support Gregory Ellen Elliott.
[01:24:20.356 --> 01:24:27.598]  This is the artist out of Toronto, we just spoke to his lawyer, who faces six months in jail for disagreeing with feminists.
[01:24:27.598 --> 01:24:35.820]  Again, let's emphasize, he did not send a threatening tweet or any kind of message that was threatening in nature at all.
[01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:37.680]  He immediately disagreed with feminists
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:45.745]  In saying they shouldn't shame and ruin a young kid's life for making an online video game simulation.
[01:24:45.745 --> 01:24:54.551]  That was his crime and for that he faces six months in jail simply because these feminists claimed that they were threatened by him disagreeing with them.
[01:24:54.551 --> 01:24:57.534]  Again, this could set an absolutely horrible precedent.
[01:24:57.534 --> 01:25:00.095]  So go and support Gregory Allen Elliott.
[01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:01.977]  The link is on my Twitter at Prison Planet.
[01:25:01.977 --> 01:25:05.859]  Now we're going to go to this special Black Friday report from Alex Jones.
[01:25:05.859 --> 01:25:06.420]  Here's the video.
[01:25:07.791 --> 01:25:10.178]  I obsess over win-wins.
[01:25:10.178 --> 01:25:14.269]  And so I think I've got four different wins here that I'm going to break down on Black Friday.
[01:25:15.583 --> 01:25:25.907]  You can get incredible deals and free shipping store-wide at InfoWarsTore.com through Black Friday, through the weekend, and until next Monday.
[01:25:25.907 --> 01:25:34.551]  And at the same time, you can get informed by watching this video on the fact that most Black Friday sales are a scam.
[01:25:34.551 --> 01:25:39.853]  Companies simply raise prices the week before and then lower them the week of to normal prices.
[01:25:39.853 --> 01:25:42.874]  And some stores do give better deals on Black Friday.
[01:25:43.334 --> 01:25:46.295]  But it's one of the worst days of the year to shop.
[01:25:46.295 --> 01:25:52.017]  And this is just a classic example of how people get screwed over because of lack of knowledge.
[01:25:52.017 --> 01:25:53.738]  Because they're not informed.
[01:25:53.738 --> 01:26:03.041]  But by going to Infowarsstore.com, you fund the very tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and defending all of our basic freedoms and exposing globalist criminal operations.
[01:26:03.041 --> 01:26:04.962]  And we're having an effect on their operations.
[01:26:04.962 --> 01:26:09.164]  You're getting great deals, and you're getting free shipping, and at the same time,
[01:26:09.944 --> 01:26:15.426]  We're exposing the fact that Black Friday itself is a big hoax.
[01:26:15.426 --> 01:26:23.049]  Black Friday itself is just a great time to get in traffic jams and to watch people acting like mindless consumer zombies.
[01:26:23.049 --> 01:26:34.314]  Now some people, when I talk about Black Friday, say, hey wait, you're criticizing the consumer zombies rushing Walmart or Target for video games or whatever, fighting over toilet paper, but then you're
[01:26:35.327 --> 01:26:37.349]  Talking about your own Black Friday.
[01:26:37.349 --> 01:26:38.470]  Well, yeah, that's what we do.
[01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:49.378]  We hijack globalist operations, try to educate people about them, and then try to take the attention that their scams are creating and siphon it off to wake people up.
[01:26:49.378 --> 01:26:50.900]  It's like culture jamming.
[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:53.702]  It's like when I cover Miley Cyrus or Kim Kardashian.
[01:26:53.702 --> 01:26:55.723]  It's not because I'm trying to cover fluff.
[01:26:55.723 --> 01:27:00.868]  It's because I'm hijacking it, using their names to then expose the whole agenda.
[01:27:01.548 --> 01:27:25.094]  So free shipping right through to next week, next Monday, and huge deals like 30% off Brain Force, 25% off Super Male and Female Vitality, 99 cent DVDs, over 20% off storable food, 30% off Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine, 33% off DNA Force, deep discounts on preparedness gear, and store-wide free shipping.
[01:27:25.094 --> 01:27:27.535]  The power you have to vote with your dollar is incredible.
[01:27:28.055 --> 01:27:33.759]  And you've seen what we've built here at InfoWars over the years because of the great work you've done supporting us.
[01:27:33.759 --> 01:27:35.780]  You don't stand behind us or beside us.
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:37.882]  You stand at the heart of our operation.
[01:27:37.882 --> 01:27:39.082]  You are the resistance.
[01:27:39.082 --> 01:27:42.285]  And it's great to have an audience that is free market that understands that.
[01:27:42.285 --> 01:27:44.346]  So I want to salute you and thank you.
[01:27:44.346 --> 01:27:57.795]  Because whether it's a Hillary for Prison t-shirt to stand up for the First Amendment, or whether it's a water filtration system to cut off the glyphosate and fluoride out of your family's water, whether it's the incredible deep cleanse or oxy powder, whatever it is,
[01:27:58.295 --> 01:28:03.100]  They're all amazing game changers because people perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:22.758]  This is a free will universe this is a universe of free association and Tyranny can never trump the free will and the actions you take so I salute you on this Black Friday week We are hijacking it we are exposing it and we're helping take the info war into the black So we have the funding we need
[01:28:23.519 --> 01:28:37.408]  To continue on and hopefully even add a few more reporters and cover more of the election on the ground and really, really, really cover the news, really break big stories and really change the narrative away from globalist control to people-based information.
[01:28:37.408 --> 01:28:39.409]  This is teleprompter-free news, folks.
[01:28:39.409 --> 01:28:41.891]  This is teleprompter-free liberty.
[01:28:41.891 --> 01:28:44.313]  This is from the heart, directly to you.
[01:28:44.313 --> 01:28:48.795]  I'm Alex Jones signing off for InfoWars.com and InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:28:48.795 --> 01:28:50.697]  From myself and the rest of the InfoWars crew,
[01:28:51.297 --> 01:28:52.359]  You are family.
[01:28:52.359 --> 01:28:53.440]  We salute you.
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:55.383]  You built this operation.
[01:28:55.383 --> 01:28:56.685]  You are the InfoWar.
[01:29:07.415 --> 01:29:14.405]  And supporters, of course, you help us build this platform, you help us grow this platform to reach many, many more people.
[01:29:14.405 --> 01:29:16.027]  We're going to go to your calls after the break.
[01:29:16.027 --> 01:29:17.889]  We're going to get some more calls in at 800-259-9231.
[01:29:17.889 --> 01:29:23.417]  We're talking about Putin, we're talking about the jet shootdown, we're talking about Turkey.
[01:29:23.937 --> 01:29:30.124]  We're talking about the War on Freedom of Speech, so we're going to go to John, Steve, Antoine and other calls 800-259-9231.
[01:29:30.124 --> 01:29:37.411]  This is the Alex Jones Show live, breaking news on this Black Friday at InfoWars.com.
[01:29:37.411 --> 01:29:39.313]  Get your calls in and stay tuned.
[01:29:39.313 --> 01:29:39.874]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:48.095 --> 01:29:51.100]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:54.705]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.693 --> 01:30:00.934]  Who do you prefer?
[01:30:00.934 --> 01:30:04.516]  Barack Obama or George W. Bush?
[01:30:04.516 --> 01:30:09.480]  Well, if you haven't figured it out by now, these guys are corporate spokesmen.
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:10.541]  They're not leaders.
[01:30:10.541 --> 01:30:13.203]  I mean, they both started illegal wars.
[01:30:13.203 --> 01:30:15.024]  Hell, they both tortured people.
[01:30:15.024 --> 01:30:18.807]  They bailed out criminal corporations and they spied on you.
[01:30:18.807 --> 01:30:23.190]  They both violated the Constitution and they even committed war crimes.
[01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:24.670]  So what's it gonna take?
[01:30:24.670 --> 01:30:27.431]  I mean, what will it take to finally wake you up?
[01:30:27.431 --> 01:30:28.251]  Think about it.
[01:30:28.251 --> 01:30:37.373]  If Joseph Stalin ran for president as a Democrat, and Adolf Hitler ran as a Republican, one of them would end up leading our country.
[01:30:37.373 --> 01:30:41.314]  It's elephants and asses screwing the masses.
[01:30:41.314 --> 01:30:44.915]  And your choice between the two parties is a myth.
[01:30:44.915 --> 01:30:49.776]  Because in reality, it is a two-party tyranny with one ideology.
[01:30:49.776 --> 01:30:51.276]  Divide and conquer.
[01:30:51.556 --> 01:30:56.500]  So join the revolution and break the false left versus right paradigm.
[01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:59.143]  Infowars.com.
[01:30:59.143 --> 01:31:02.406]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[01:33:20.342 --> 01:33:21.965]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:26.841]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:26.841 --> 01:33:29.403]  We're going to go through your calls here in a few minutes.
[01:33:29.403 --> 01:33:31.885]  We've got Rob Dew as well with news popping in.
[01:33:31.885 --> 01:33:39.131]  Now, of course, one of the top stories on InfoWars.com yesterday was Donald Trump tweeting out a link to InfoWars.
[01:33:39.131 --> 01:33:43.435]  Now, of course, that's not a huge story in and of itself.
[01:33:43.435 --> 01:33:45.817]  I've disagreed with Trump on some issues in the past.
[01:33:46.357 --> 01:33:53.587]  For example, you know, he gave a speech a couple of days ago saying how great waterboarding was and that we should torture terrorists.
[01:33:53.587 --> 01:33:58.334]  Of course, we know for a fact that waterboarding and torture doesn't work.
[01:33:58.334 --> 01:34:00.357]  It only extracts false confessions.
[01:34:01.383 --> 01:34:04.525]  But then he said we should do it anyway because look at what they're doing to us.
[01:34:04.525 --> 01:34:07.407]  Well, we've been through that argument a million times.
[01:34:07.407 --> 01:34:17.434]  America does not stand for torturing people, especially given the fact that most of those people who came out of Gitmo were basically goat herders and taxi drivers.
[01:34:17.434 --> 01:34:22.097]  I think it was like 90% of them were proven to have no connections to terrorism whatsoever.
[01:34:22.097 --> 01:34:24.059]  And anyway, it doesn't work.
[01:34:24.059 --> 01:34:27.021]  So why would you sacrifice the national reputation of a country
[01:34:28.158 --> 01:34:31.542]  On that premise, I mean, does America want to turn into North Korea?
[01:34:31.542 --> 01:34:34.825]  So I've disagreed with Trump on a lot of issues.
[01:34:34.825 --> 01:34:43.835]  I still find the fact that he had a phone call with Bill Clinton two weeks before he announced his run for the Republican candidacy very odd indeed.
[01:34:43.835 --> 01:34:44.996]  So it's not as if we've been
[01:34:45.839 --> 01:34:50.801]  You know, in this full-on worship fest for Trump, as many conservatives have.
[01:34:50.801 --> 01:35:05.746]  But he did send out this tweet, because there's been a controversy surrounding him over the past few days, which is, he basically came out and said there were thousands of Muslims celebrating 9-11 in New York, in New Jersey, on September 11, 2001.
[01:35:07.547 --> 01:35:13.789]  The media came out and fact-checked him and said that this never happened, there was no evidence of this.
[01:35:13.789 --> 01:35:30.572]  So then Trump pointed to a Washington Post article which was published on September 18th, which did make reference to Middle Easterners celebrating 9-11, basically, you know, cheering and hollering on top of a building as the plane went into the World Trade Center.
[01:35:30.572 --> 01:35:36.574]  Now, of course, people who have studied that kind of information for the past 14 years know that those
[01:35:37.254 --> 01:35:39.675]  Individuals weren't Muslims, they were Israelis.
[01:35:39.675 --> 01:35:42.897]  This was the infamous case of the Israeli art students.
[01:35:42.897 --> 01:35:51.981]  Of course, speculation at the time was that they were spies, they had advanced knowledge of the plot, and you can debate that ad infinitum, but they weren't Muslims.
[01:35:52.541 --> 01:36:06.109]  So Trump was wrong in that regard, but it's not wrong to say that there's a ton of anecdotal evidence to suggest that there were Muslims celebrating 9-11 in New York and in New Jersey on that fateful day.
[01:36:06.109 --> 01:36:19.297]  In fact, there was a hashtag that Trump drew attention to where people were giving their stories, people who lived in New Jersey, who said they personally saw crowds of people, up to a hundred people, Muslims celebrating 9-11.
[01:36:20.746 --> 01:36:35.762]  So then, InfoWars.com publishes this story out of BizPacReview, which is basically the writer's story of how she also personally saw Muslims celebrating 9-11 on the day of the attacks.
[01:36:35.762 --> 01:36:39.425]  Trump tweets it out, tweets a link to InfoWars.com.
[01:36:40.677 --> 01:36:42.398]  But of course, that's not the story.
[01:36:42.398 --> 01:36:55.183]  The story is the crybaby, butthurt, frothing meltdown in the immediate aftermath, which was, oh my god, Donald Trump tweeted out the discredited InfoWars.com.
[01:36:55.183 --> 01:36:59.224]  You know, like we haven't been on the Drudge Report for five, six years.
[01:36:59.224 --> 01:37:02.205]  Like we haven't been picked up by all these massive publications.
[01:37:02.205 --> 01:37:03.866]  The fact that Trump did it.
[01:37:03.866 --> 01:37:07.167]  This is surely going to be the final straw for Trump.
[01:37:07.167 --> 01:37:08.308]  This is going to sink him.
[01:37:09.168 --> 01:37:15.097]  Of course, complete baloney, and yet the likes of Gawker came out with a headline.
[01:37:15.097 --> 01:37:15.298]  I mean,
[01:37:16.272 --> 01:37:21.677]  How short for news do you have to be to write about the fact that Trump tweeted InfoWars?
[01:37:21.677 --> 01:37:23.218]  He's talked about us before.
[01:37:23.218 --> 01:37:28.303]  We had the drug smuggling footage out of Mexico with Josh Owens and Joe Biggs.
[01:37:28.303 --> 01:37:30.725]  Trump mentioned that in a live speech.
[01:37:30.725 --> 01:37:37.430]  And again, people got butthurt over that, like that didn't happen or that was discredited when we got the exclusive footage.
[01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:39.012]  So then you have the likes of Gawker
[01:37:39.472 --> 01:37:48.876]  Who of course routinely try and ruin people's lives and abuse inside sources and the whole nine yards like they're the paragon of credibility.
[01:37:48.876 --> 01:37:54.559]  Trump tweeted an InfoWars.com link and the election is still 348 days away.
[01:37:54.559 --> 01:37:56.420]  Like it was some kind of cardinal sin.
[01:37:57.625 --> 01:38:15.458]  The article reads, the text of this tweet is the headline of an article published on conspiracy theory suppository InfoWars.com in which a New Jersey resident argues that Donald Trump's claims about Muslim Americans celebrating the destruction of the World Trade Center are not fear-mongering, crypto-fascist lies.
[01:38:15.458 --> 01:38:15.858]  So again,
[01:38:16.713 --> 01:38:18.194]  They're making light of it.
[01:38:18.194 --> 01:38:30.821]  They've devoted an entire article to the fact that Trump tweeted InfoWars, God forbid, and of course the crybaby butthurt meltdown from liberals on Twitter then commenced.
[01:38:30.821 --> 01:38:38.866]  You also had the likes of ThinkProgress coming out with this headline, Trump cites 9-11 truther website to support his false claims about 9-11.
[01:38:38.866 --> 01:38:39.186]  Of course,
[01:38:41.471 --> 01:38:43.172]  The claims weren't false.
[01:38:43.172 --> 01:38:50.677]  There are numerous anecdotal reports from individuals who were in New Jersey on that day who saw Muslims celebrating 9-11.
[01:38:50.677 --> 01:38:51.978]  So that's not false.
[01:38:51.978 --> 01:38:55.281]  I mean, maybe to claim that there were thousands is an exaggeration.
[01:38:55.281 --> 01:39:01.745]  But the fact is, numerous people now in the aftermath of this controversy are coming out and saying they saw the same thing.
[01:39:01.745 --> 01:39:02.906]  But isn't it interesting
[01:39:03.775 --> 01:39:15.238]  That Think Progress comes out and immediately writes a headline about this, similar to how Media Matters, which is one of their affiliated organizations, basically writes an article.
[01:39:15.238 --> 01:39:21.780]  They don't do it anymore because it became too ridiculous, but they used to write an article every time Drudge linked to InfoWars.
[01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:32.804]  Like that was evidence of some dark, seedy collusion, and like that discredited Drudge simply because he was linking to us, which, you know, he has done probably over a thousand times in the years since.
[01:39:33.544 --> 01:39:40.911]  And of course, ThinkProgress, which we documented before, is basically an Obama White House front group.
[01:39:40.911 --> 01:39:44.635]  They have weekly meetings with the Obama administration.
[01:39:44.635 --> 01:39:57.308]  And in fact, the Center for American Progress Director, which is the group behind ThinkProgress, Jennifer Palmieri, said the organization is focused around, quote, driving the White House's message and agenda.
[01:39:58.126 --> 01:40:05.393]  These are the people that are attacking InfoWars, that are attacking Trump, merely for tweeting out an InfoWars link.
[01:40:05.393 --> 01:40:16.904]  An Obama front group, an admitted Obama front group, headed up by Bill Clinton's former Chief of Staff John Podesta, who of course was also head of Barack Obama's presidential transition team.
[01:40:17.544 --> 01:40:21.648]  So this is not an independent media organisation.
[01:40:21.648 --> 01:40:34.178]  This is a mouthpiece for the White House and now once again they're attacking us because they're all butthurt and crying over the fact that, God forbid, Donald Trump tweeted out InfoWars.
[01:40:34.798 --> 01:40:38.519]  Paul, Paul, I just want to jump in here.
[01:40:38.519 --> 01:40:44.041]  You've got this Washington Post article from 2001, and here's a quote from it, which we put in our article.
[01:40:44.041 --> 01:41:04.009]  In Jersey City, within two hours, within hours of two jetliners plowing into the World Trade Center, law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties, tailgate-style parties, on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river.
[01:41:04.997 --> 01:41:08.038]  Yeah, and that's the article that Trump drew attention to.
[01:41:08.038 --> 01:41:15.020]  And then the writer of that article, who is a disabled reporter, tried to back away from it.
[01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:24.723]  So as soon as Trump was getting on the offensive and the media was starting to backpedal as a result, this reporter said, oh, I don't remember writing that, I don't know whether that's accurate or not.
[01:41:24.723 --> 01:41:28.304]  He actually threw himself under the bus as part of this process.
[01:41:28.304 --> 01:41:30.325]  So then they shift the controversy
[01:41:31.045 --> 01:41:37.990]  And claim that Trump was doing an insensitive impression of this disabled reporter.
[01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:39.551]  We've got the video now actually.
[01:41:39.551 --> 01:41:40.351]  Play the video.
[01:41:40.351 --> 01:41:45.835]  This is the huge new controversy about Trump that's not going to sink him like the previous 15 haven't.
[01:41:45.835 --> 01:41:46.796]  Let's go ahead with the video.
[01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:49.015]  Written by a nice reporter.
[01:41:49.015 --> 01:41:50.296]  Now the poor guy, you gotta see this guy.
[01:41:50.296 --> 01:41:51.996]  Oh, I don't know what I said.
[01:41:51.996 --> 01:41:53.317]  Oh, I don't remember.
[01:41:53.317 --> 01:41:55.518]  He's going like, I don't remember.
[01:41:55.518 --> 01:41:57.498]  Oh, maybe that's what I said.
[01:41:57.498 --> 01:41:58.879]  This is 14 years ago.
[01:41:58.879 --> 01:42:01.840]  He still, they didn't do a retraction.
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:06.162]  That reporter he is talking about is Serge Kovaleski, who now works for the New York Times.
[01:42:06.162 --> 01:42:11.383]  As you can see right there, he suffers from a chronic condition that impairs movement of his arms.
[01:42:11.383 --> 01:42:15.525]  A Times spokesman says they find it outrageous that Trump would ridicule the man's appearance.
[01:42:16.761 --> 01:42:18.342]  So that's CNN talking about it.
[01:42:18.342 --> 01:42:21.465]  So basically they flipped the controversy into something else.
[01:42:21.465 --> 01:42:24.487]  Well it sounds like he was ridiculing his mind, Paul.
[01:42:24.487 --> 01:42:26.349]  I don't remember 14 years ago.
[01:42:26.349 --> 01:42:29.592]  That's what it sounded like to me, what he was doing to this reporter.
[01:42:29.592 --> 01:42:30.512]  Exactly.
[01:42:30.512 --> 01:42:36.637]  So then Trump came out with this statement and said he didn't even remember the physical appearance or the disability of this reporter.
[01:42:36.637 --> 01:42:40.481]  He was ridiculing him for what he said, saying he was stupid.
[01:42:41.521 --> 01:42:46.926]  And yet they're still trying to double down on this controversy to try and, you know, catch Trump out.
[01:42:46.926 --> 01:42:49.068]  Haven't they learned their lesson by now?
[01:42:49.068 --> 01:42:53.091]  I mean, there's an article out in the Daily Caller.
[01:42:53.091 --> 01:42:58.456]  15 times Donald Trump said something people thought would damage his campaign, and it didn't.
[01:42:58.456 --> 01:43:03.180]  And this goes back to July where he said that basically John McCain was not a war hero.
[01:43:04.306 --> 01:43:21.150]  Everybody said this would be the end of Trump, this was the end of his campaign, because they seem to be under the false delusion that people who vote for Trump, Trump supporters, actually care about Trump making politically incorrect statements, if you can even call them that.
[01:43:21.150 --> 01:43:22.671]  They don't care!
[01:43:22.671 --> 01:43:31.573]  So how, in any way, is this going to sink his campaign when his campaign is supported by people who don't give a damn, when he talks about illegal immigrants?
[01:43:32.313 --> 01:43:34.058]  That was supposed to sink his campaign.
[01:43:34.058 --> 01:43:36.224]  How dare he be so racist?
[01:43:36.224 --> 01:43:39.913]  You know, eventually most of his support came from that stance.
[01:43:39.913 --> 01:43:40.675]  Build the wall.
[01:43:41.741 --> 01:43:45.142]  He was talking about, you know, giving out Lindsey Graham's phone number.
[01:43:45.142 --> 01:43:52.225]  That was supposedly a dastardly act that would publicly shame and end his campaign in tatters.
[01:43:52.225 --> 01:43:53.586]  Absolutely nothing happened.
[01:43:53.586 --> 01:43:59.228]  The whole Megyn Kelly thing, you know, you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.
[01:43:59.228 --> 01:44:01.889]  Oh my God, how dare Donald Trump, the misogynistic pig.
[01:44:02.509 --> 01:44:04.512]  This is surely going to sink him.
[01:44:04.512 --> 01:44:06.675]  Talking about Carly Fiorina's face.
[01:44:06.675 --> 01:44:08.357]  Again, nothing happened.
[01:44:08.357 --> 01:44:10.220]  He only got more popular.
[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:14.586]  So, I don't know why they think that this controversy is going to end him because it's clearly not.
[01:44:14.586 --> 01:44:18.932]  He's gone on the offensive again against the New York Times and basically said,
[01:44:19.818 --> 01:44:21.479]  You owe me an apology.
[01:44:21.479 --> 01:44:25.722]  So again, he's learned the lesson, which is what I tweeted out last night.
[01:44:25.722 --> 01:44:32.487]  Never apologize for fake controversies whipped up by the perpetually offended drive-by media.
[01:44:32.487 --> 01:44:33.827]  That's what it's all about.
[01:44:33.827 --> 01:44:35.909]  This public shaming culture.
[01:44:35.909 --> 01:44:46.476]  The only people who become victims of it are the ones who back down, the ones who show weakness, roll over in a fetal position and apologize for something that they shouldn't even apologize for.
[01:44:46.476 --> 01:44:49.338]  And what was interesting about that was last night,
[01:44:49.998 --> 01:44:55.661]  Trump didn't just retweet that, he actually quoted me and sent it out to all his followers.
[01:44:55.661 --> 01:45:02.144]  And then that caused more crybaby butthurt from the Liberals and from the mainstream media.
[01:45:02.144 --> 01:45:05.246]  And there was even Matt Taibbi out of the Rolling Stone.
[01:45:05.826 --> 01:45:09.447]  Again, criticising Trump merely for quoting me.
[01:45:09.447 --> 01:45:11.808]  So again, it's controversy after controversy.
[01:45:11.808 --> 01:45:13.088]  He's the Teflon candidate.
[01:45:13.088 --> 01:45:19.370]  I don't even agree with him on everything, but it's just funny how these fake controversies only seem to make him stronger.
[01:45:19.370 --> 01:45:21.091]  Have you got any more comments on that, Rob?
[01:45:21.531 --> 01:45:25.597]  Well, you know, he said some things like, I think we should put monitor bracelets on Muslims.
[01:45:25.597 --> 01:45:28.020]  And he said some things that I don't agree with.
[01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:29.682]  I don't think a wall is going to solve anything.
[01:45:29.682 --> 01:45:36.230]  I think what you have to do is look at the policies that make people want to come to the United States and stop giving away so many freebies.
[01:45:36.230 --> 01:45:36.731]  And, you know,
[01:45:37.765 --> 01:45:41.666]  We got to do something with the millions of people that are here illegally.
[01:45:41.666 --> 01:45:44.767]  You're either going to, and you know, he says he wants to ship them back.
[01:45:44.767 --> 01:45:49.748]  It just seems it's turning into this prophecy that Alex Jones talked about, about these FEMA camps.
[01:45:49.748 --> 01:45:52.448]  And that is going to happen, I think, in the next presidency.
[01:45:52.448 --> 01:45:58.890]  They're either going to create camps for the Muslims that are coming in, or they're going to create them for the immigrants that they want to ship out.
[01:45:58.890 --> 01:46:02.911]  And then once those camps are built, look out people, because they're going to be coming for you next.
[01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:07.522]  Alright, let's go to some of these calls now because they've been holding a while.
[01:46:07.522 --> 01:46:09.643]  Let's go to Steve in Pennsylvania.
[01:46:09.643 --> 01:46:10.504]  You're on the air, Steve.
[01:46:10.504 --> 01:46:13.185]  Go ahead.
[01:46:13.185 --> 01:46:15.347]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:46:15.347 --> 01:46:32.417]  I'm a housekeeper from Pennsylvania and currently in Pennsylvania we have a governor that does not want to listen to the constituents elected in by bringing in these Syrian refugees
[01:46:35.229 --> 01:46:38.291]  And we the people have put out a petition.
[01:46:38.291 --> 01:46:43.655]  70,000 people signed it.
[01:46:43.655 --> 01:46:46.597]  70,000 people from Pennsylvania signed it.
[01:46:46.597 --> 01:46:58.745]  And our governor still hasn't passed the budget with the legislature, still won't listen to the people, so we'll plan a rally likely next week, sometime next week.
[01:47:01.562 --> 01:47:04.984]  I'm trying to get people organized here in Pennsylvania.
[01:47:04.984 --> 01:47:08.205]  I'm trying to get governors organized, constitutionalists, veterans.
[01:47:08.205 --> 01:47:12.107]  I'm going on yards because we all need to come together.
[01:47:12.107 --> 01:47:13.827]  We can't be fighting amongst ourselves.
[01:47:13.827 --> 01:47:24.652]  We have to come together and act like Americans instead of being this butthurt, myanomical tool that the government's been using to divide and conquer.
[01:47:27.145 --> 01:47:28.366]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[01:47:28.366 --> 01:47:31.529]  Yeah, but I mean, didn't you hear what Obama said yesterday?
[01:47:31.529 --> 01:47:38.214]  He said, the Syrian Muslim migrants are just like the pilgrims on the Mayflower, right?
[01:47:38.214 --> 01:47:47.402]  Of course, then he had liberals saying on the same day that the pilgrims were genocidal religious extremists, that they, you know, scalped American Indians and whatever.
[01:47:47.402 --> 01:47:51.906]  So they couldn't quite line up what was politically correct and what wasn't, but
[01:47:52.646 --> 01:48:00.356]  You know, Obama said that he's going to forget about, you know, these ISIS jihadists who are going to sneak in via the refugee wave.
[01:48:00.356 --> 01:48:02.338]  Obama's already got that fixed.
[01:48:02.338 --> 01:48:11.789]  He's going to the Paris Climate Conference to waffle on about global warming and he said that that would be a stunning rebuke to ISIS.
[01:48:12.850 --> 01:48:15.352]  Merely because he was going there to talk about global warming.
[01:48:15.352 --> 01:48:22.417]  I'm sure the ISIS rob-do are quaking in their boots that Obama's going to waffle on about global warming for a few days, right?
[01:48:22.417 --> 01:48:23.178]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:48:23.178 --> 01:48:26.381]  And that climate change is causing terrorism in this world.
[01:48:26.381 --> 01:48:27.922]  Like, we didn't have terrorism before.
[01:48:28.582 --> 01:48:38.291]  And, you know, I had arguments with my family about climate change last night, and they start talking about the polar bears, stuff that's been discredited, the ice melting.
[01:48:38.291 --> 01:48:43.195]  You know, we're looking at Antarctica, the ice is getting bigger, there's more ice coming up there now.
[01:48:43.195 --> 01:48:47.159]  And I just pulled up that change.org petition for the Refused Refugees.
[01:48:47.159 --> 01:48:48.560]  71,000 people have signed it.
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:49.301]  They need 3,700 people to
[01:48:53.945 --> 01:48:54.045]  to
[01:49:12.745 --> 01:49:19.210]  For bringing in Syrian refugees, she seems to be like an Obama mouthpiece that has been elected over there.
[01:49:19.210 --> 01:49:22.873]  And it was an amazing cross-section of people he interviewed.
[01:49:22.873 --> 01:49:30.719]  Talked to a lot of state reps who were informed, talking about how the FBI is not allowing these, has admitted that they can't vet these people.
[01:49:30.719 --> 01:49:31.379]  They've admitted it.
[01:49:31.379 --> 01:49:34.241]  The head of the FBI said, we cannot vet these people.
[01:49:34.241 --> 01:49:36.763]  We're not sure if they are going to be terrorists or not.
[01:49:38.124 --> 01:49:43.065]  All the uninformed people who were for this, and mostly they were Syrians who were saying, look, we got to bring these in.
[01:49:43.065 --> 01:49:44.105]  These people are vetted.
[01:49:44.105 --> 01:49:46.826]  It's mostly women and children.
[01:49:46.826 --> 01:49:49.306]  I mean, it's a it's a it's definitely a conundrum.
[01:49:49.306 --> 01:49:50.907]  But what is what is happening?
[01:49:50.907 --> 01:49:57.768]  What is what are the policies that our government has done that has put this sort of in motion, this migrant crisis that is going on?
[01:49:57.768 --> 01:50:03.049]  And if you look at let's see, I believe it was headed up here a second ago.
[01:50:03.049 --> 01:50:07.210]  There that ringleader of the of the terrorist group.
[01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.970]  Yeah, they bragged about it.
[01:50:28.397 --> 01:50:31.578]  So, those are the policies that are allowing this stuff to happen.
[01:50:31.578 --> 01:50:33.199]  It's open borders.
[01:50:33.199 --> 01:50:38.341]  It's favorable conditions to give people freebies to entice them to come.
[01:50:38.341 --> 01:50:45.243]  And then also, it's our foreign policy of creating wars in areas and trying to destabilize governments around the world.
[01:50:45.243 --> 01:50:47.124]  Okay, we'll be back with more of your calls.
[01:50:47.124 --> 01:50:49.605]  Sean, Sherry, Robert, that's one deal.
[01:50:49.605 --> 01:50:53.426]  Call the Alex Jones Show live, breaking news at infowars.com.
[01:50:53.426 --> 01:50:54.147]  Don't go away.
[01:50:54.147 --> 01:50:55.027]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:58.925 --> 01:51:01.986]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:51:01.986 --> 01:51:04.606]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:51:04.606 --> 01:51:05.347]  Croix River.
[01:51:05.347 --> 01:51:07.587]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:51:07.587 --> 01:51:10.548]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:51:10.548 --> 01:51:11.428]  His excuse?
[01:51:11.428 --> 01:51:12.748]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:51:12.748 --> 01:51:14.369]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:51:14.369 --> 01:51:20.130]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[01:53:57.190 --> 01:54:04.432]  I can see for miles and miles and miles.
[01:54:09.090 --> 01:54:17.236]  We're back live from the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:17.236 --> 01:54:19.698]  Huge developments in Turkey and Syria.
[01:54:19.698 --> 01:54:23.421]  Of course, we had the shoot-down of the Russian jet earlier this week.
[01:54:23.421 --> 01:54:30.607]  Now we've got even more evidence of Turkey being complicit in selling ISIS oil, funding ISIS, arming ISIS.
[01:54:30.607 --> 01:54:33.069]  We're going to get into those stories subsequently.
[01:54:33.069 --> 01:54:34.890]  But Alex Jones is about to comment on this.
[01:54:34.890 --> 01:54:35.471]  Alex, go ahead.
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:45.308]  In between getting chores done for the company and the family today while you're taking over on Black Friday, I read Kurt Nemo's article at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:45.308 --> 01:54:51.535]  Airgun promises war with Russia if Russia shoots down planes over Syria.
[01:54:52.386 --> 01:55:02.713]  Because we know that Airgun, for the last three years, has said more than 14 times, we wrote a story about it two days ago, that, hey, we're allowed to fly into Syrian airspace.
[01:55:02.713 --> 01:55:08.036]  They even have used artillery in the Syrian territory, claiming that it's in their strategic rights.
[01:55:08.036 --> 01:55:10.558]  So, total hypocrisy.
[01:55:10.558 --> 01:55:12.939]  And now, he says, because of these 250-mile range,
[01:55:14.781 --> 01:55:18.247]  Uh, supersonic plane-destroying missiles.
[01:55:18.247 --> 01:55:24.057]  We're talking fifth-generation, super high-tech, anti-aircraft missiles the size of an aircraft.
[01:55:24.057 --> 01:55:25.941]  I mean, these are super hardcore missiles.
[01:55:26.468 --> 01:55:30.971]  Basically, they're just supersonic giant cruise missiles that the Russians have brought in.
[01:55:30.971 --> 01:55:33.852]  I mean, these are usually nuclear-tipped.
[01:55:33.852 --> 01:55:35.753]  These are super hardcore.
[01:55:35.753 --> 01:55:53.223]  Of course, they're not nuclear-tipped right now that they go and fire a bunch of missiles out the front or a bunch of shrapnel, but long story short, Russia has moved in super high-tech weapons, decided to take on NATO in the United States, into the area there in Syria right on the border with Turkey and saying,
[01:55:54.102 --> 01:55:57.844]  Next time you fly over Syrian airspace, we're blowing you out of the sky.
[01:55:57.844 --> 01:56:00.645]  Hey, tit for tat, and here God has shed.
[01:56:00.645 --> 01:56:03.927]  Basically, this will cause the unthinkable.
[01:56:03.927 --> 01:56:06.028]  We're going to respond with full war.
[01:56:06.028 --> 01:56:09.630]  So, Turkey wouldn't have done this with our full NATO backing.
[01:56:10.768 --> 01:56:17.149]  He's been given NATO backing, just like they told Saddam, you know, back in 1990, go ahead and invade Kuwait on record.
[01:56:17.149 --> 01:56:18.910]  So they're setting Turkey up.
[01:56:18.910 --> 01:56:23.511]  I mean, I don't think NATO's going to stand with Turkey if he goes along with this.
[01:56:23.511 --> 01:56:27.652]  You see him in the news saying, Iraq may have destroyed NATO and all this stuff.
[01:56:27.652 --> 01:56:29.592]  This is over the top.
[01:56:29.592 --> 01:56:38.054]  In fact, I feel guilty not even being there today, even though I was in this morning until like 11, even though I'm working on a bunch of stuff for the company and get the word out.
[01:56:39.011 --> 01:56:40.292]  I feel guilty.
[01:56:40.292 --> 01:56:43.856]  Like, I should be there, but you're doing an incredible job, so is Ram Dude.
[01:56:43.856 --> 01:56:51.604]  But this is so crazy when you realize that this is from the official Turkish news.
[01:56:51.604 --> 01:56:59.132]  These quotes that Kurt Nemo has in his article are linked to the official presidential ministry making these statements.
[01:56:59.132 --> 01:57:00.193]  He actually says, quote,
[01:57:01.423 --> 01:57:07.625]  If our planes fly over Turkish airspace and are shot down, it is an act of war, and we're going to war with Russia.
[01:57:07.625 --> 01:57:10.926]  And I will not even tell you, it's unspeakable.
[01:57:10.926 --> 01:57:12.947]  And Turkey, to have U.S.
[01:57:12.947 --> 01:57:19.870]  nuclear weapons and medium-range missiles be able to hit Moscow, it's only 500, 600 miles away, right there.
[01:57:19.870 --> 01:57:23.451]  So this is all World War III-type level garbage.
[01:57:23.451 --> 01:57:25.171]  And extreme news is saying that.
[01:57:25.171 --> 01:57:26.732]  This is so evil.
[01:57:27.546 --> 01:57:30.847]  Because here's our government backing ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[01:57:30.847 --> 01:57:35.709]  Paul Watson, I just want to add again, funding this operation now more than ever is so key.
[01:57:35.709 --> 01:57:36.910]  We're having a big effect.
[01:57:36.910 --> 01:57:39.211]  Our news is getting out trying to stop this.
[01:57:39.211 --> 01:57:41.732]  That's why we have free shipping until next Monday.
[01:57:41.732 --> 01:57:45.914]  And $9.95 colloidal silver, normally $19.95.
[01:57:45.914 --> 01:57:47.454]  In stores it's $25.95.
[01:57:47.454 --> 01:57:53.137]  The exact same colloidal silver, we private label it for the biggest manufacturer in the country.
[01:57:53.137 --> 01:57:56.438]  Silver bullet, $9.95 at import or store.
[01:57:57.459 --> 01:58:03.203]  And I throw in this on Black Friday because I don't think this will be the end of the world, but it could become that.
[01:58:03.203 --> 01:58:10.148]  The point is, the elites are getting more and more reckless every day, and it's totally insane, and I can't believe that more media in the U.S.
[01:58:10.148 --> 01:58:15.492]  isn't opposing this homicidal, genocidal, over-the-top idiocy.
[01:58:15.492 --> 01:58:22.357]  Look, if Turkey can sit down Russian aircraft that fly into airspace for nine seconds max and keep violating
[01:58:22.937 --> 01:58:24.798]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:59:50.729 --> 01:59:53.336]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:04.827 --> 02:00:09.651]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.651 --> 02:00:11.252]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.252 --> 02:00:12.794]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.794 --> 02:00:16.997]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.997 --> 02:00:21.041]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.269 --> 02:00:27.972]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show, special Black Friday edition.
[02:00:27.972 --> 02:00:30.154]  We've got Alex Jones on the line, of course.
[02:00:30.154 --> 02:00:39.122]  We put out the report that Turkey warned Russia to stop bombing ISIS, otherwise it would have serious consequences.
[02:00:39.122 --> 02:00:43.265]  That came out before the downing of this Russian fighter jet.
[02:00:43.265 --> 02:00:48.750]  Now Vladimir Putin is out saying, US new flight path of plane downed by Turkey.
[02:00:49.290 --> 02:00:59.540]  President Vladimir Putin said, Russia had given prior information to the United States of the flight path of the plane downed by Turkey on the Syrian border.
[02:00:59.540 --> 02:01:03.784]  They're now calling this a planned provocation, Alex.
[02:01:03.784 --> 02:01:07.227]  Well of course it's planned, of course it's planned.
[02:01:07.227 --> 02:01:10.030]  Our government is run by sworn enemies of America.
[02:01:12.472 --> 02:01:20.458]  They are literal sworn enemies of George Washington, of our Second Amendment, of private property, of the incredible renaissance that is America.
[02:01:20.458 --> 02:01:22.480]  They are sworn enemies.
[02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:23.661]  All people with your head.
[02:01:23.661 --> 02:01:25.983]  The people that run our country have hijacked it.
[02:01:25.983 --> 02:01:27.904]  They want to extinguish liberty.
[02:01:27.904 --> 02:01:30.166]  Russia is trying to build up a sovereignty.
[02:01:30.166 --> 02:01:31.747]  It's slated for destruction.
[02:01:31.747 --> 02:01:34.590]  They blew up the main power to Ukraine last week.
[02:01:34.590 --> 02:01:39.754]  George Soros, a raving psychopath demon, is always trying to destroy the dollar.
[02:01:40.894 --> 02:01:42.995]  Is running around thumbing at the mouth.
[02:01:42.995 --> 02:01:44.555]  And they knew where those planes were.
[02:01:44.555 --> 02:01:45.796]  They set them up.
[02:01:45.796 --> 02:01:46.896]  They were ready.
[02:01:46.896 --> 02:01:52.158]  I mean, it took a minute for those missiles to get to them, but they admit they were only in airspace nine seconds.
[02:01:52.158 --> 02:01:54.738]  This is total horse manure.
[02:01:54.738 --> 02:02:02.761]  And the truth is, Turkey has been bombarding for four years with heavy artillery.
[02:02:02.761 --> 02:02:09.143]  The Turkish, the Syrian military, fighting back against the al-Qaeda and al-Nusra garbage bins.
[02:02:09.859 --> 02:02:19.443]  Uh, so, all of this is going on, and now Turkey has said, we're going to fly into your country whenever we want, and if you shoot us down, we're going to war with Russia.
[02:02:19.443 --> 02:02:21.884]  And this is how the scum operates.
[02:02:21.884 --> 02:02:26.046]  This is what they're up to, this is what they do, this is who runs our country.
[02:02:26.046 --> 02:02:27.766]  And, uh, just God help us.
[02:02:27.766 --> 02:02:36.150]  God help us that we're run by such psychopathic scum that has run this New World Order, who are hell-bent on destroying the whole planet if we don't stop them.
[02:02:36.150 --> 02:02:38.611]  And that's why the globalists are coming after us.
[02:02:39.528 --> 02:02:44.311]  They're demonizing us, they're attacking us in the news because we're effective and we're telling the truth.
[02:02:44.311 --> 02:02:58.640]  That's why it's imperative when you sign off on Facebook, or your email, or on YouTube, or on Twitter, or on any other platform, on comment boards, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.com, free speech.
[02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:05.504]  Because they're coming after our free speech, they're coming after the Liberty Movement, they're coming after those of us who stand up for truth.
[02:03:05.504 --> 02:03:08.426]  They are demonizing us, they're calling for us to be shut down.
[02:03:09.466 --> 02:03:26.276]  They've got infiltrators, stalkers, operators all over us because we're effective but your prayers are sustaining us and it's so important that you not take independent true media, there's not much of it out there like Drugs Report and InfoWars, that you don't take these organizations for granted and that on
[02:03:26.989 --> 02:03:42.163]  Days like Black Friday, you take that day back, it's been a fraud, with free shipping and some of the biggest discounts, $9.95, 2-ounce bottle of 30 parts per million, colloidal silver, $19.95 normally, and that's even a deal.
[02:03:42.163 --> 02:03:44.405]  The leading competitor, private labels in Texas, $24.95.
[02:03:44.405 --> 02:03:45.386]  We have it $9.95 at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:03:49.529 --> 02:03:55.611]  And the $2 we make on that, that's what it costs us, because Coal Silver is helping get you high quality.
[02:03:55.611 --> 02:04:09.716]  It funds our operation, the books, the videos, the super metal vitality, huge discounts today, the brain force, the DNA force, all of it, the huge discounts on affordable foods, the huge discounts and 20% off on Alexa Pure Pro.

[02:04:13.678 --> 02:04:20.131]  And we just need the funding to have the reporters, the investigative journalists, and to go against this enemy as hardcore as we can.
[02:04:20.131 --> 02:04:23.779]  Paul Joseph Watson, God bless you and the whole crew, and Rob Dewe, throwing it back to you.
[02:04:25.074 --> 02:04:25.955]  OK, thanks Alex.
[02:04:25.955 --> 02:04:27.956]  We've got 30 seconds left in the segment.

[02:04:29.297 --> 02:04:35.742]  Continuing to talk about this geopolitical meltdown that's happened in the aftermath of the Russian jet shoot-down.
[02:04:35.742 --> 02:04:38.423]  We're going to talk more about the oil.
[02:04:38.423 --> 02:04:40.945]  Who's in control of selling that oil in Turkey?
[02:04:40.945 --> 02:04:47.230]  Now a deluge of information has come out suggesting that it's the son of the Turkish president.
[02:04:47.230 --> 02:04:49.431]  We're going to get into that after the break and take your calls at 800-259-9231.

[02:07:56.130 --> 02:08:10.939]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:08:10.939 --> 02:08:12.499]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:08:12.499 --> 02:08:16.181]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:26.075 --> 02:08:31.179]  The Black Live final hour of the Alex Jones Show will be going to your calls here in this segment.
[02:08:31.179 --> 02:08:33.540]  Breaking news up on the Drudge Report.
[02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:38.604]  Black Friday protest, a police shooting shuts down Main Chicago Shopping Street.
[02:08:38.604 --> 02:08:46.689]  They're out during Black Friday, the Black Lives Matter protesters demonstrating against the shooting of Laquan McDonald.
[02:08:46.689 --> 02:08:52.834]  Of course, unlike Michael Brown and some of these other shootings, which were, the evidence suggests, justified.
[02:08:53.354 --> 02:09:07.384]  If you watch the video of the Laquan McDonald shooting, which has caused outrage over the past few days, he was basically gunned down 16 bullets, gunned down like a dog, and from the video footage posed no threat to the officers.
[02:09:07.384 --> 02:09:13.549]  So this is one of these cases like Eric Garner, where you can understand the outrage.
[02:09:13.549 --> 02:09:19.513]  But of course the solution to that, given the fact that the cop responsible has been charged with first-degree murder,
[02:09:20.033 --> 02:09:28.519]  Is not to go out and loot and burn down your own communities as the mainstream media would support Black Lives Matter in doing so.
[02:09:28.519 --> 02:09:34.583]  We had the Time Magazine article back during the Ferguson protests in defense of rioting.
[02:09:34.583 --> 02:09:39.786]  And of course, then we had the Baltimore riots, these people going out burning down their own communities.
[02:09:40.226 --> 02:09:57.020]  Only causing damage to other black-owned businesses, which of course is not the right way to respond, even though, in my belief in this case, the Laquan McDonald shooting, that outrage is justified, because it was a clear example of police brutality.
[02:09:57.020 --> 02:10:00.463]  But we've got huge changes at the Infowars store right now.
[02:10:00.463 --> 02:10:01.944]  Rob Dew is here to explain them.
[02:10:01.944 --> 02:10:02.445]  Rob, go ahead.
[02:10:02.785 --> 02:10:12.869]  Yeah, if you go to our new store, people watching online at InfoWars.com forward slash show, you could pull up, here you go, click here to access the mega savings.
[02:10:12.869 --> 02:10:20.232]  If you want to see what we have in store for you today on the Black Friday, our holiday mega deals, and these will be going through the weekend as well.
[02:10:20.612 --> 02:10:23.734]  So if you can't make it in today, you got the rest of the weekend.

[02:10:34.181 --> 02:10:35.502]  I have got one for my son.
[02:10:35.502 --> 02:10:38.264]  He likes to, you know, whittle, among other things.
[02:10:38.264 --> 02:10:41.126]  I'm trying to get him not to stab the ground as much.
[02:10:42.126 --> 02:10:44.688]  We've got Father Republic, 99 cents.
[02:10:44.688 --> 02:10:47.229]  Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, in-game.
[02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:49.551]  Some Molan Labe koozies, only $3.95.
[02:10:49.551 --> 02:10:53.273]  And then, here's the film that really woke me up.
[02:10:53.273 --> 02:10:58.696]  I mean, I was already awake to what was going on, but this really woke me up to government-sponsored terror, 9-11, Road to Tyranny.
[02:10:58.696 --> 02:11:03.419]  He's got some amazing footage from the Oklahoma City bombing, in addition to the information covered on 9-11.
[02:11:04.279 --> 02:11:09.985]  Also have some InfoWars Life Selects, so great deals on the four-week supply, the three-month supply.

[02:11:16.170 --> 02:11:20.875]  And Paul, as we were going to break, you were talking about how the nepotism involved in Turkey
[02:11:21.375 --> 02:11:35.047]  You know, apparently the Prime Minister's son, it's his oil company that's benefiting from all this cheap oil being produced by ISIS and they seem to be buying it left and right and funding this ongoing terror operation.
[02:11:36.448 --> 02:11:39.090]  Yeah, that's right, and we've got headlines today about that.
[02:11:39.090 --> 02:11:44.813]  And again, this is not just the Syrians saying this, it's not just RT, it's not the Kremlin saying this.
[02:11:44.813 --> 02:11:50.377]  Zero Hedge did a big report on this the other day, which I tweeted out, which I encourage people to check out.
[02:11:50.377 --> 02:11:52.918]  Basically, there's a headline out of Sputnik today, though.
[02:11:52.918 --> 02:11:59.383]  Erdogan downed Su-24, that's the Russian fighter jet, to revenge son's disrupted oil business.
[02:12:00.143 --> 02:12:09.612]  Turkey shot down Russia's bomber as revenge for the destruction of oil smuggling business that belongs to Risa Erdogan's son, a Syrian minister stated.
[02:12:09.612 --> 02:12:12.075]  And again, it's not just the Syrians saying this.
[02:12:12.075 --> 02:12:14.137]  People have dug in, they've done the research.
[02:12:14.137 --> 02:12:20.323]  The son of the Turkish president owns these oil companies, these big tankers that ship the oil out.
[02:12:20.914 --> 02:12:22.655]  He's sending it to Japan.
[02:12:22.655 --> 02:12:28.819]  Obviously he's buying it at half the price of the normal market rate because this is black market.
[02:12:28.819 --> 02:12:29.699]  This is ISIS.
[02:12:29.699 --> 02:12:32.761]  They've stolen the oil from Syria and Iraq.
[02:12:32.761 --> 02:12:41.386]  They're selling it to Turkey at half the normal rate and of course buying weapons to carry out the kind of massacres that we saw in Paris.
[02:12:41.386 --> 02:12:46.749]  This is all happening with the full guarantee and approval of the Turkish government.
[02:12:46.749 --> 02:12:48.811]  This is another article out of Spicer.com.
[02:12:49.764 --> 02:12:52.766]  Look who's helping ISIS trade oil illegally.
[02:12:52.766 --> 02:12:56.488]  The main source of income for ISIS is illegal sale of oil.
[02:12:56.488 --> 02:13:01.270]  This finance war and terror in Syria and Iraq and terrorism abroad like in Beirut and Paris.
[02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:08.014]  To achieve this sale they must have help and it's fairly obvious that Turkey is the main guarantor of this.
[02:13:08.014 --> 02:13:19.220]  And so basically it's come out that this, the son of the Turkish President, in pursuit of this Neo-Ottoman Empire which the Turkish President is now trying to build again by allying with ISIS,
[02:13:20.103 --> 02:13:23.926]  He's in control of these shipping companies, these maritime companies.
[02:13:23.926 --> 02:13:28.830]  He's made agreements with companies in Europe, in Asia, he's shipping it to Japan.
[02:13:29.628 --> 02:13:36.810]  He's taking the stolen, looted ISIS oil, putting it on these ships and sending it off to Asia.
[02:13:36.810 --> 02:13:45.232]  He's making a profit, ISIS is making a profit, and of course they're using the money to buy bombs and ammunition to kill European citizens.
[02:13:45.232 --> 02:13:49.173]  This is just another example of Turkey being allied with ISIS.
[02:13:49.173 --> 02:13:54.334]  And again, it's not just Bashar al-Assad saying that, it's not just Vladimir Putin saying that.
[02:13:55.054 --> 02:14:05.539]  We had Wesley Clark, the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, come out on CNN a couple of days ago and say that Turkey is allied with ISIS.
[02:14:05.539 --> 02:14:07.260]  We had the report from Nafeez Ahmed.
[02:14:08.109 --> 02:14:21.793]  The large cache of intelligence documents that were recovered from an ISIS safehouse raid in Turkey that found, quote, direct dealings between Turkish officials and ranking ISIS members.
[02:14:21.793 --> 02:14:23.994]  We also had the quote out of Newsweek.
[02:14:23.994 --> 02:14:35.778]  A former ISIS communications technician said that part of his job was to, quote, connect ISIS field captains and commanders from Syria with people in Turkey
[02:14:36.358 --> 02:14:44.424]  On innumerable occasions, ISIS commanders told us to fear nothing because there was full cooperation with the Turks.
[02:14:44.424 --> 02:14:53.572]  So, reams and reams of evidence about how Turkey is allied with ISIS, and of course the rebel jihadists, the so-called moderate rebels that aren't moderate,
[02:14:54.520 --> 02:14:56.282]  They're also defecting to ISIS.
[02:14:56.282 --> 02:14:58.024]  They're giving their weapons to ISIS.
[02:14:58.024 --> 02:14:59.626]  Turkey supports them as well.
[02:14:59.626 --> 02:15:10.938]  Because Turkey, like the United States, like NATO, is more concerned about destabilizing and toppling the government of Bashar al-Assad than it is about getting rid of ISIS.
[02:15:11.519 --> 02:15:18.803]  We had the Defense Intelligence Agency documents where the Pentagon foresaw the rise of a Salafist principality.
[02:15:18.803 --> 02:15:26.948]  They knew their actions in Syria, destabilizing the government, arming these jihadist groups, would lead to the rise of ISIS.
[02:15:26.948 --> 02:15:30.750]  And of course ISIS is now fighting against Bashar al-Assad.
[02:15:30.750 --> 02:15:37.955]  So all along, and in their own documents, it's been in their interest to keep ISIS in the field, to not destroy ISIS,
[02:15:38.655 --> 02:15:50.986]  Which is why Obama waited 15 months before bombing ISIS oil fields and ISIS oil tankers, whereas the Russians did it almost immediately.
[02:15:50.986 --> 02:15:54.629]  In fact, there's another article on that today out of Gateway Pundit.
[02:15:55.490 --> 02:16:01.915]  Former CIA Director, Obama didn't bomb ISIS oil because of environmental impact.
[02:16:01.915 --> 02:16:09.981]  Former CIA Director Michael Morrell said Obama did not bomb ISIS's oil infrastructure because of environmental concerns.
[02:16:09.981 --> 02:16:11.943]  And if you believe that, you believe anything.
[02:16:11.943 --> 02:16:23.972]  Of course, we also had the report, they were dropping leaflets to these people working with ISIS, driving the oil tankers, giving them 45 minutes warning to flee from the scene.
[02:16:24.838 --> 02:16:27.179]  Russia didn't give them the same warning.
[02:16:27.179 --> 02:16:31.000]  They're wiping out ISIS's oil infrastructure to some effect.
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:40.002]  And of course, the Obama administration waited 15 months because again, it's in their interest to have ISIS in the region to destabilize Assad.
[02:16:40.002 --> 02:16:45.203]  Not my words, the words of the Pentagon who foresaw that in the first place.
[02:16:45.203 --> 02:16:47.363]  Let's go to one of these calls.
[02:16:47.363 --> 02:16:49.564]  Antoine, you've been waiting the longest, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:16:51.474 --> 02:16:53.995]  Hi, Paul.
[02:16:53.995 --> 02:16:57.776]  Yeah, I was thinking about what you were saying about the war and all this stuff.
[02:16:57.776 --> 02:16:58.857]  And it is insane.
[02:16:58.857 --> 02:17:05.479]  I think that, you know, I don't feel safe, but it's not really about who feels safe or not.
[02:17:05.479 --> 02:17:10.260]  And this war is, yeah, it's crazy.
[02:17:10.260 --> 02:17:15.122]  I was thinking like, you know, you guys got so much information, you and Alex,
[02:17:16.107 --> 02:17:22.311]  And I was thinking, you know, if all of this is as bad as you say it is, somebody should cash it, you know, take it to the bank, you know.
[02:17:22.311 --> 02:17:26.774]  And then some of this stuff is dangerous, like, like the terrorist attack stuff.
[02:17:26.774 --> 02:17:31.477]  You can't really put out the information, you know, about a new terrorist attack that may happen.
[02:17:31.477 --> 02:17:33.279]  But, you know, stuff is gonna happen.
[02:17:33.279 --> 02:17:34.880]  You guys know this stuff.
[02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:37.481]  And like, it's threatening that, you know,
[02:17:38.829 --> 02:17:47.001]  We're out here in this world and there's nothing we can do about it as small people, but together we can at least put a voice in.
[02:17:47.848 --> 02:17:54.815]  And try and get behind somebody or something, that's a good idea.
[02:17:54.815 --> 02:18:05.365]  One thing we can do is, and thanks for the call, we can prevent Obama from importing 100,000 Syrian refugees, as the media calls them, into America.
[02:18:05.365 --> 02:18:12.632]  Given the fact that we know, and the Paris massacre mastermind bragged about the fact that he exploited this program,
[02:18:13.536 --> 02:18:18.880]  This refugee red carpet to get into Europe to carry out that attack.
[02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:20.481]  So you can oppose it on that level.
[02:18:20.481 --> 02:18:39.116]  Of course, there's a massive backlash in Europe now of people who are being called Nazis by their own government, who are simply trying to preserve their communities and who are opposed to bringing in potential jihadists who will kill them while they're sitting in cafes, while they're in theatres, as we saw in Paris.
[02:18:39.116 --> 02:18:40.937]  Dion, in Illinois, you're on the air.
[02:18:40.937 --> 02:18:41.478]  Go ahead, Dion.
[02:18:43.355 --> 02:18:58.751]  Yeah, Paul, after the Russian jet was shut down, a day after the Russians, they did an airstrike on a Turkish convoy in northern Syria headed to ISIS city.
[02:18:58.751 --> 02:18:59.792]  Did you hear about that?
[02:18:59.792 --> 02:19:00.633]  It killed seven.
[02:19:02.068 --> 02:19:04.028]  Yeah, that was one of the reprisal attacks.
[02:19:04.028 --> 02:19:09.070]  It wasn't really reported widely in the media, but it did happen that Russia took that action.
[02:19:09.070 --> 02:19:12.330]  They're also cutting off economic ties with Turkey.
[02:19:12.330 --> 02:19:17.571]  There was a big gas pipeline deal, I believe, and a big nuclear power plant deal.
[02:19:17.571 --> 02:19:20.172]  So Russia and Putin are taking these measures.
[02:19:20.172 --> 02:19:25.093]  Of course, China came out the day after the shoot-down of the Russian jet and said,
[02:19:25.859 --> 02:19:30.262]  The Kremlin may take the decision to attack Turkish airliners.
[02:19:30.262 --> 02:19:39.588]  And of course, as Alex was talking about in the last segment, now Erdogan has come out and said he's pledged to start a war over Russian anti-aircraft system in Syria.
[02:19:39.588 --> 02:19:43.951]  Basically said that if Turkish jet fighters are targeted in Syria,
[02:19:44.631 --> 02:19:46.492]  He will declare war on Russia.
[02:19:46.492 --> 02:19:48.553]  That's basically the context of his statement.
[02:19:48.553 --> 02:19:50.515]  So, Wild Times indeed.
[02:19:50.515 --> 02:19:54.557]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show with more of your calls in the next segment.

[02:20:28.769 --> 02:20:33.031]  With a new year coming, it's time for a new way to look at weapon storage.
[02:20:33.031 --> 02:20:36.272]  Safes can't be accessed quickly, and racks are unsafe for children.
[02:20:36.272 --> 02:20:38.813]  Covert Cabinets are the next level in home defense.

[02:22:23.598 --> 02:22:25.899]  My name is Jonathan Wright, and I'm 40 years old.
[02:22:25.899 --> 02:22:28.761]  I recently went from a desk job to a manual labor job.
[02:22:28.761 --> 02:22:29.882]  Normally, I'm worn out.
[02:22:29.882 --> 02:22:35.685]  With Energy Enhanced One World Way, I now recover so quickly that I can perform very hard work all day long.
[02:22:35.685 --> 02:22:41.049]  I use Energy Enhanced One World Way for breakfast and lunch, and I experience less hunger throughout the day.
[02:22:41.049 --> 02:22:44.150]  I have a 30% increase in energy, and I just feel better.

[02:22:59.682 --> 02:23:07.685]  Thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day and the home security industry wants you to believe that's your only option.
[02:23:07.685 --> 02:23:13.166]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.
[02:23:13.166 --> 02:23:18.068]  You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.
[02:23:18.068 --> 02:23:21.589]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.
[02:23:21.589 --> 02:23:24.010]  But there's a better way to protect your home.

[02:24:16.980 --> 02:24:19.362]  I obsess over win-wins.
[02:24:19.362 --> 02:24:23.425]  And so I think I've got four different wins here that I'm going to break down on Black Friday.
[02:24:24.764 --> 02:24:35.094]  You can get incredible deals and free shipping storewide at InfoWareStore.com through Black Friday, through the weekend, and until next Monday.
[02:24:35.094 --> 02:24:43.723]  And at the same time, you can get informed by watching this video on the fact that most Black Friday sales are a scam.
[02:24:43.723 --> 02:24:48.828]  Companies simply raise prices the week before and then lower them the week of to normal prices.
[02:24:48.968 --> 02:24:49.168]  Yes.
[02:24:49.168 --> 02:24:52.510]  And some stores do give better deals on Black Friday.
[02:24:52.510 --> 02:24:55.472]  But it's one of the worst days of the year to shop.
[02:24:55.472 --> 02:25:01.176]  And this is just a classic example of how people get screwed over because of lack of knowledge.
[02:25:01.176 --> 02:25:02.917]  Because they're not informed.
[02:25:02.917 --> 02:25:12.224]  But by going to Infowarsstore.com, you fund the very tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and defending all of our basic freedoms and exposing globalist criminal operations.
[02:25:12.224 --> 02:25:14.545]  And we're having an effect on their operations.
[02:25:14.545 --> 02:25:18.348]  You're getting great deals, and you're getting free shipping, and at the same time,
[02:25:19.108 --> 02:25:24.613]  We're exposing the fact that Black Friday itself is a big hoax.
[02:25:24.613 --> 02:25:32.220]  Black Friday itself is just a great time to get in traffic jams and to watch people acting like mindless consumer zombies.
[02:25:32.220 --> 02:25:43.510]  Now some people, when I talk about Black Friday, say, hey wait, you're criticizing the consumer zombies rushing Walmart or Target for video games or whatever, fighting over toilet paper, but then you're
[02:25:44.511 --> 02:25:46.513]  Talking about your own Black Friday.
[02:25:46.513 --> 02:25:47.634]  Well, yeah, that's what we do.
[02:25:47.634 --> 02:25:58.542]  We hijack globalist operations, try to educate people about them, and then try to take the attention that their scams are creating and siphon it off to wake people up.
[02:25:58.542 --> 02:26:00.064]  It's like culture jamming.
[02:26:00.064 --> 02:26:10.032]  It's like when I cover Miley Cyrus or Kim Kardashian, it's not because I'm trying to cover fluff, it's because I'm hijacking it, using their names to then expose the whole agenda.
[02:26:10.712 --> 02:26:34.261]  So, free shipping right through to next week, next Monday, and huge deals like 30% off Brain Force, 25% off Super Male and Female Vitality, 99-cent DVDs, over 20% off Storable Food, 30% off Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine, 33% off DNA Force, deep discounts on preparedness gear, and store-wide free shipping.
[02:26:34.261 --> 02:26:36.702]  The power you have to vote with your dollar is incredible.
[02:26:37.222 --> 02:26:42.946]  And you've seen what we've built here at InfoWars over the years because of the great work you've done supporting us.
[02:26:42.946 --> 02:26:44.947]  You don't stand behind us or beside us.
[02:26:44.947 --> 02:26:47.049]  You stand at the heart of our operation.
[02:26:47.049 --> 02:26:48.249]  You are the resistance.
[02:26:48.249 --> 02:26:51.452]  And it's great to have an audience that is free market, that understands that.
[02:26:51.452 --> 02:26:53.513]  So I want to salute you and thank you.
[02:26:53.513 --> 02:27:06.962]  Because whether it's a Hillary for Prison t-shirt to stand up for the First Amendment, or whether it's a water filtration system to cut off the glyphosate and fluoride out of your family's water, whether it's the incredible deep cleanse or oxy powder, whatever it is,
[02:27:07.482 --> 02:27:12.265]  They're all amazing game changers because people perish for lack of knowledge.
[02:27:12.265 --> 02:27:14.427]  This is a free will universe.
[02:27:14.427 --> 02:27:21.972]  This is a universe of free association and tyranny can never trump the free will and the actions you take.
[02:27:21.972 --> 02:27:25.154]  So I salute you on this Black Friday week.
[02:27:25.154 --> 02:27:26.515]  We are hijacking it.
[02:27:26.515 --> 02:27:30.438]  We are exposing it and we're helping take the info war into the black.
[02:27:30.438 --> 02:27:31.919]  So we have the funding we need.
[02:27:32.688 --> 02:27:46.596]  To continue on and hopefully even add a few more reporters and cover more of the election on the ground and really, really, really cover the news, really break big stories and really change the narrative away from globalist control to people-based information.
[02:27:46.596 --> 02:27:48.577]  This is teleprompter-free news, folks.
[02:27:48.577 --> 02:27:51.059]  This is teleprompter-free liberty.
[02:27:51.059 --> 02:27:53.480]  This is from the heart, directly to you.
[02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:57.983]  I'm Alex Jones signing off for InfoWars.com and InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:27:57.983 --> 02:27:59.864]  From myself and the rest of the InfoWars crew,
[02:28:00.484 --> 02:28:01.524]  You are family.
[02:28:01.524 --> 02:28:02.624]  We salute you.
[02:28:02.624 --> 02:28:04.545]  You built this operation.
[02:28:04.545 --> 02:28:05.565]  You are the Infowar.
[02:28:05.565 --> 02:28:11.786]  All right, that's Alex Jones telling you about the great deals at the Infowar store.
[02:28:11.786 --> 02:28:13.366]  We're back live now.
[02:28:13.366 --> 02:28:14.606]  We've been talking about Turkey.
[02:28:14.606 --> 02:28:17.187]  We've been talking about the shoot-down of the Russian fighter jet.
[02:28:17.187 --> 02:28:19.807]  And actually, we've got a caller from Turkey.
[02:28:19.807 --> 02:28:22.588]  So we'll go to him now and hold him over for the next segment.
[02:28:22.588 --> 02:28:24.308]  Bora in Turkey, you're on the air.
[02:28:24.308 --> 02:28:25.948]  Go ahead.
[02:28:25.948 --> 02:28:27.609]  Hello, Paul.
[02:28:27.609 --> 02:28:28.389]  Hey, how's it going?
[02:28:28.389 --> 02:28:29.169]  What's on your mind today?
[02:28:30.109 --> 02:28:30.789]  Going good.
[02:28:30.789 --> 02:28:34.871]  Okay, I was going to talk about the Turkish President Erdogan.
[02:28:34.871 --> 02:28:39.473]  The Turkish President, he was in prison.
[02:28:39.473 --> 02:28:42.234]  I think it was in 1998 or so.
[02:28:42.234 --> 02:28:44.955]  He was in prison for provoking the citizens.
[02:28:44.955 --> 02:28:51.318]  He's the only Turkish President who was in the prison.
[02:28:51.738 --> 02:28:52.199]  Yeah.
[02:29:09.056 --> 02:29:30.420]  He had a lawsuit pending on him because he forged the theater, the city's theater ticket and like a few months ago I think they had another lawsuit pending on him for high treason and he destroys all the lawsuits
[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:34.341]  And he does not allow anybody to file a lawsuit on him.
[02:29:34.341 --> 02:29:41.103]  And recently, today, he locked up two journalists in Turkey.
[02:29:41.103 --> 02:29:42.663]  Yeah, we're going to get into that after the break.
[02:29:42.663 --> 02:29:43.163]  Stay there.
[02:29:43.163 --> 02:29:44.383]  I've got more questions for you.
[02:29:44.383 --> 02:29:45.924]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[02:29:45.924 --> 02:29:46.764]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:46.764 --> 02:29:48.084]  Stay tuned.
[02:29:48.084 --> 02:29:49.485]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.485 --> 02:29:52.025]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.025 --> 02:29:54.706]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.820 --> 02:30:06.123]  In the second Democrat debate this last weekend, it was last-minute change the day before to talk about foreign policy because of the terrorist attacks.
[02:30:06.123 --> 02:30:08.624]  The Sanders campaign was furious.
[02:30:08.624 --> 02:30:11.485]  Bernie wasn't ready to talk about terrorism.
[02:30:11.485 --> 02:30:16.127]  The moderator asked him if he still thought the greatest threat to national security was climate change.
[02:30:16.127 --> 02:30:16.867]  Absolutely.
[02:30:16.867 --> 02:30:19.948]  In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.
[02:30:20.168 --> 02:30:21.810]  Do you understand what Sanders is saying?
[02:30:21.810 --> 02:30:25.253]  Climate change is directly related to terrorism.
[02:30:25.253 --> 02:30:28.476]  Terrorism has nothing to do with wars for oil and power.
[02:30:28.476 --> 02:30:30.118]  It's not about a clash of cultures.
[02:30:30.118 --> 02:30:34.001]  And as every liberal will tell you, it has nothing to do with Islam.
[02:30:34.001 --> 02:30:36.023]  So it must be climate change.
[02:30:36.023 --> 02:30:36.784]  Bernie!
[02:30:36.784 --> 02:30:40.628]  Al Qaeda and ISIS were not created to fight climate change!
[02:30:41.048 --> 02:30:42.510]  But there is an indirect link.
[02:30:42.510 --> 02:30:45.474]  Bernie Sanders won't tell you, however, if he even sees it.
[02:30:45.474 --> 02:30:55.807]  Al Qaeda and ISIS are a creation of the same governments and multinational corporations that are trying to create a global government using terrorism and climate change as an excuse.
[02:30:55.807 --> 02:30:57.510]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:30:58.649 --> 02:31:04.395]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[02:31:04.395 --> 02:31:18.850]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:27.095]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[02:31:27.095 --> 02:31:32.678]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[02:31:32.678 --> 02:31:36.240]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[02:31:36.240 --> 02:31:40.363]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[02:31:40.363 --> 02:31:44.245]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[02:31:44.685 --> 02:31:48.806]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.
[02:31:48.806 --> 02:31:53.868]  Secure your Liver Shield today exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com for the lowest price available.

[02:31:57.469 --> 02:32:01.910]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:32:01.910 --> 02:32:06.712]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[02:32:06.812 --> 02:32:07.192]  We're good.
[02:32:28.320 --> 02:32:29.800]  Attention InfoWarriors!

[02:33:10.965 --> 02:33:13.587]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:13.587 --> 02:33:21.313]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:21.313 --> 02:33:27.157]  Former CIA operative get ready for World War 3.
[02:33:27.157 --> 02:33:29.659]  This is a top story up on Infowars.com.
[02:33:29.659 --> 02:33:37.045]  Bob Bair, a former CIA operative, believes the situation in the Middle East is out of control and shaping up to look like the beginning of World War 3.
[02:33:38.010 --> 02:33:42.632]  Quote, this mosaic in the Middle East of conflict is getting out of control.
[02:33:42.632 --> 02:33:44.213]  Bare told CNN.
[02:33:44.213 --> 02:33:50.896]  So more prominent officials coming forward with these quite apocalyptic quotes about World War 3.
[02:33:50.896 --> 02:33:54.178]  We're talking about the downing of the Russian fighter jet.
[02:33:54.178 --> 02:33:55.899]  We're talking about how it's come to light.
[02:33:56.809 --> 02:34:09.917]  That the son of the President in Turkey is basically the main guy running the looted ISIS oil shipments from Syria and Iraq into Turkey and then out into Europe and Japan.
[02:34:09.917 --> 02:34:15.041]  Of course we've had these accusations and in fact concrete evidence that ISIS is allied with Turkey.
[02:34:15.925 --> 02:34:28.972]  Now it's been revealed that the guy running the stolen, looted ISIS oil supplies, which funds at least half, if not more, of their terror network, is the son of the President of Turkey, Bilal Erdogan.
[02:34:28.972 --> 02:34:32.074]  This has come out not just out of Syrian-Russian sources.
[02:34:32.074 --> 02:34:33.895]  Zero Hedge did a big article on it.
[02:34:34.455 --> 02:34:40.660]  And in fact we're talking to Bora in Turkey and in fact I think it was Shirin in Texas wanted to talk about Trump.
[02:34:40.660 --> 02:34:45.443]  Call back in because I want to touch on Donald Trump once again and that whole controversy.
[02:34:45.443 --> 02:34:56.652]  But Bora in Turkey, how is the public sentiment, what's the reaction to Turkey's downing of this Russian fighter jet and their sentiment towards the government in general?
[02:34:58.186 --> 02:35:02.570]  Okay, there are like three types of people in this country.
[02:35:02.570 --> 02:35:07.834]  The first type, they're the Erdogan supporters, like Obama supporters.
[02:35:07.834 --> 02:35:16.701]  We call them the sheeple, and they have to confirm with his actions, and so they're cool with it.
[02:35:16.701 --> 02:35:17.342]  They even make jokes.
[02:35:20.228 --> 02:35:32.077]  When you mention about Russia cutting off the natural gas, they just cannot even... They have no answer to that.
[02:35:32.077 --> 02:35:36.040]  Because if Russia cuts the natural gas, we're fucked.
[02:35:36.420 --> 02:35:42.890]  Because it's going to be winter soon and, excuse my language, but we are all screwed.
[02:35:42.890 --> 02:35:52.544]  And the third, the second type of people are the people, educated people, and those people know what's going on in this country and our country has been hijacked.
[02:35:53.805 --> 02:35:54.285]  I think so.
[02:36:13.299 --> 02:36:26.189]  Unemployment is so high and there are other problems in this country and apparently his supporters are making a fortune out of this.
[02:36:26.189 --> 02:36:33.354]  There are car rental companies who can give you a car plus the gas for $750 a month.
[02:36:35.095 --> 02:36:45.182]  Which is really cheap in here, and God knows where the gas is coming from, and if you're his people... It's coming from stolen ISIS supplies, presumably.
[02:36:45.182 --> 02:36:56.690]  But another point that you mentioned, and of course again this is a completely corrupt dictatorship we've now got in Turkey, you mentioned the fact that these journalists who report on these ties between the Turkish government and ISIS
[02:36:57.210 --> 02:37:02.073]  Are either finding themselves killed in mysterious circumstances or put in prison.
[02:37:02.073 --> 02:37:04.374]  We got an Associated Press article today.
[02:37:04.374 --> 02:37:10.598]  Two Turkish journalists have been jailed for reporting that Turkey was smuggling arms to Syrian rebels.
[02:37:10.598 --> 02:37:12.799]  We got another story out of The Independent.
[02:37:12.799 --> 02:37:17.882]  Journalist reporting on ISIS dies in Turkey in suspicious circumstances.
[02:37:17.882 --> 02:37:23.926]  Again, another one of these reporters who was doing reports, writing articles about the fact that
[02:37:24.466 --> 02:37:28.328]  Turkish government, Erdogan, was tied in, allied with ISIS.
[02:37:28.328 --> 02:37:33.770]  We have another article here, two Syrian journalists beheaded in Turkey's southeast.
[02:37:33.770 --> 02:37:36.751]  Again, beheaded by ISIS within Turkey.
[02:37:36.751 --> 02:37:42.354]  So, how do people who make this connection get treated in Turkey, judging by these headlines?
[02:37:45.018 --> 02:37:48.140]  Well, they are threatened indeed.
[02:37:48.140 --> 02:37:55.224]  As a matter of fact, a typical citizen is threatened indeed in this country on a daily basis.
[02:37:55.224 --> 02:38:03.528]  From your workplace to public transportation, the cops harass you all the time, and you have no rights to sue anybody.
[02:38:04.228 --> 02:38:04.949]  You have no rights.
[02:38:04.949 --> 02:38:06.710]  You have no civil rights.
[02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:10.433]  You cannot make complaints on anything.
[02:38:10.433 --> 02:38:12.955]  You cannot complain to the government.
[02:38:12.955 --> 02:38:15.898]  You cannot file complaints about the government.
[02:38:15.898 --> 02:38:17.880]  You cannot be against the government.
[02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:20.662]  And if you're not Muslim, you're screwed.
[02:38:21.222 --> 02:38:38.606]  And furthermore, I believe that he's being threatened because I was working on an internet show, like a cartoon show, and after I was promoting about that show, I also got threatened too.
[02:38:38.606 --> 02:38:42.607]  It had some footage about Recep Tayyip Erdogan and some footage about him.
[02:38:43.388 --> 02:38:44.008]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:38:58.662 --> 02:38:59.703]  Yeah.
[02:38:59.703 --> 02:39:00.003]  Yeah.
[02:39:28.682 --> 02:39:31.145]  It's completely lawless and corrupt.
[02:39:31.145 --> 02:39:31.986]  Thanks for the call.
[02:39:31.986 --> 02:39:33.408]  Really fascinating stuff, Bora.
[02:39:33.408 --> 02:39:39.134]  Be sure to call in when Alex is hosting on future issues because we'll be sure to revisit this topic.
[02:39:39.134 --> 02:39:42.397]  But thanks for the call, Bora from Turkey.
[02:39:42.397 --> 02:39:43.318]  Sean in Canada.
[02:39:43.318 --> 02:39:46.322]  We're going to go to Cherie, but Sean in Canada, you've been holding the longest.
[02:39:46.322 --> 02:39:46.882]  You're on the air.
[02:39:46.882 --> 02:39:47.363]  Go ahead, Sean.
[02:39:49.489 --> 02:39:52.712]  Hi Paul, great to speak with you.
[02:39:52.712 --> 02:39:54.254]  Thanks for letting me on.
[02:39:54.254 --> 02:40:04.003]  I was just wanting to comment about this ridiculous free speech Twitter criminal harassment case going on up here.
[02:40:04.003 --> 02:40:04.404]  I've never
[02:40:05.248 --> 02:40:14.292]  Perhaps never been more ashamed of the laws in this country and lengths that people take them to to stifle free expression and speech.
[02:40:14.292 --> 02:40:16.433]  It's just shameful.
[02:40:16.433 --> 02:40:22.636]  That's Gregory Allen Elliott, the defendant, the poor guy.
[02:40:22.636 --> 02:40:32.681]  I really hope that once this is all done, he's given reparations because these creatures that are setting out to destroy his life have no remorse, it seems, and they're using the state
[02:40:33.567 --> 02:40:33.848]  I'm good.
[02:40:43.386 --> 02:40:44.687]  I think it's just incredible.
[02:40:44.687 --> 02:40:49.150]  I mean, it's amazing the fact that it wasn't thrown out within minutes.
[02:40:49.150 --> 02:40:56.875]  But the good news is, you know, from this having basically no attention a few months ago, there were a few reports about it, now he's raised over $52,000.
[02:40:56.875 --> 02:41:01.958]  This court case has cost him over $100,000 already.
[02:41:01.958 --> 02:41:05.880]  Again, his life has been completely ruined by these insane
[02:41:06.900 --> 02:41:21.090]  Repressive, cry-bully feminists over-tagging them in some tweets, over-defending himself over fake charges that he was a paedophile, over-defending a young kid whose life they tried to ruin because he made an online computer game.
[02:41:21.090 --> 02:41:22.891]  And this is how these feminists act.
[02:41:22.891 --> 02:41:25.693]  And they're not just ruining individual people's lives.
[02:41:25.693 --> 02:41:27.894]  They want to ruin free speech on the internet.
[02:41:27.894 --> 02:41:28.895]  They want to make it
[02:41:29.651 --> 02:41:36.895]  A criminal harassment, a form of criminal harassment and a form of cyber violence if you merely disagree with them on Twitter.
[02:41:36.895 --> 02:41:41.097]  That's what they got up in front of the UN and said with Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe Quinn.
[02:41:41.097 --> 02:41:44.059]  But Sean, thanks for the call, really appreciate it.
[02:41:44.059 --> 02:41:46.620]  Cherie in Texas, you wanted to talk about Trump, go ahead.
[02:41:47.876 --> 02:41:48.877]  Thank you, Paul.
[02:41:48.877 --> 02:41:51.519]  This is the Media vs. Trump.
[02:41:51.519 --> 02:42:00.926]  Because of the media's divisiveness and their misinformation that's been going on for I don't know how long, the media, as far as I'm concerned, has shut themselves in the foot.
[02:42:00.926 --> 02:42:08.412]  And way before Trump came on the scene, and they don't see, they don't get it, or maybe they do, I don't know, that it's us against the media.
[02:42:08.952 --> 02:42:11.853]  And then Trump comes along and he's on our side.
[02:42:11.853 --> 02:42:32.760]  So now, every time the media picks on him or films him under this jauntous yellow light, seems to be popular now, or every time they quote him out of context, all they're doing really is strengthening our resolve to stand by him, and then they wonder why his numbers keep going up, you know?
[02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:38.042]  Well, they need to look to themselves, because they lost our respect a long time ago.
[02:42:39.299 --> 02:42:40.679]  Here's what's interesting about this.
[02:42:41.823 --> 02:42:45.666]  The Hill has come out with an article, GOP in panic over Trump.
[02:42:45.666 --> 02:42:49.870]  The Republican establishment is nearing full-blown panic about Donald Trump.
[02:42:49.870 --> 02:42:56.955]  The demise of Trump's candidacy has been predicted by centrist Republicans and the media alike virtually since the day it began.
[02:42:56.955 --> 02:43:02.140]  But there's no empirical evidence at all to suggest it's happening, as you just said.
[02:43:02.140 --> 02:43:07.584]  Last month, ThinkProgress collated more than 30 predictions of the business mogul's imminent demise.
[02:43:07.584 --> 02:43:10.807]  One typical example was the Washington Post's Jonathan Capehart,
[02:43:11.408 --> 02:43:19.513]  Who said, quote, the beginning of the end of Trump in mid-July, soon after the mogul criticized the Vietnam War record of Senator John McCain.
[02:43:19.513 --> 02:43:28.559]  So more than 30 predictions from these mainstream journalists stretching back nearly six months ago that these fake scandals would result in the demise of Trump.
[02:43:29.139 --> 02:43:41.108]  And again, you had this panic, which makes no sense to me, within the Republican Party, that if Trump gets the domination for the Republicans, he can't possibly beat Hillary Clinton.
[02:43:41.108 --> 02:43:56.780]  And while that may have been true, as recently as a few weeks ago, if you actually look, and this is out of real clear politics, general election Trump versus Clinton, this is a hypothetical matchup between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, if they went head to head.
[02:43:57.577 --> 02:44:02.362]  The polls from a couple of weeks ago show that Clinton was ahead at one point.
[02:44:02.362 --> 02:44:05.265]  She had a 15 point lead over Trump.
[02:44:05.265 --> 02:44:07.968]  That suddenly collapsed to one point.
[02:44:07.968 --> 02:44:18.599]  And now in the aftermath of the Paris Massacre, which of course went a long way to proving Trump's point about these refugees, three of them at least, slipped into Europe via this migrant red carpet.
[02:44:19.259 --> 02:44:26.124]  Now a Fox News poll shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head with Hillary Clinton, Trump would come out on top.
[02:44:26.124 --> 02:44:32.489]  He's now plus 5 compared to Clinton being plus 15 as little as a month ago.
[02:44:32.489 --> 02:44:41.676]  So this whole idea that, you know, Donald Trump can't beat Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head is beginning to be proven wrong by the polls.
[02:44:41.676 --> 02:44:44.579]  Whether that continues remains to be seen, but I think it's
[02:44:45.427 --> 02:44:48.531]  Completely inaccurate to say that he has no chance whatsoever.
[02:44:48.531 --> 02:45:01.044]  And that is the reason given by these establishment Republicans as to why they're trying to sink Trump and why they're in such a panic about him and why they try to hijack these fake controversies.
[02:45:01.044 --> 02:45:02.246]  It's not just the left wing.
[02:45:02.924 --> 02:45:05.768]  You know, to try and demonise Trump over and over again.
[02:45:05.768 --> 02:45:07.871]  There's a Daily Caller article which I mentioned before.
[02:45:07.871 --> 02:45:14.099]  15 times Donald Trump said something people thought would damage his campaign, and it didn't.
[02:45:14.099 --> 02:45:17.664]  Again, example after example, he is the Teflon candidate.
[02:45:17.664 --> 02:45:18.946]  I don't agree with him on everything.
[02:45:19.631 --> 02:45:27.514]  But the mere act of him daring to tweet Infowars.com or quote me caused another major meltdown like that was going to sink him.
[02:45:27.514 --> 02:45:29.876]  Again, already blown over.
[02:45:29.876 --> 02:45:36.238]  But we're going to see more and more controversies manufactured about Donald Trump in the weeks and months to come.
[02:45:36.238 --> 02:45:39.080]  Let's go to more of these callers who's been holding the longest.
[02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:40.480]  We got Robert in Missouri.
[02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:41.040]  Go ahead, Robert.
[02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:44.922]  You're on the air.
[02:45:44.922 --> 02:45:48.784]  Yeah, my question was about this whole attack on language.
[02:45:49.776 --> 02:46:09.255]  Now, when I was in college, I learned that the scientific name for language in English is argument, and then they... I said something about it, and then I was quickly shut up by the teacher, and, oh, that's okay, and, you know, everything, but...
[02:46:10.530 --> 02:46:18.677]  My question was, who is the authority on making, revising, and editing the English language?
[02:46:18.677 --> 02:46:25.402]  Because I've asked that question so many times and tried to look it up, but I haven't got any answer.
[02:46:25.402 --> 02:46:35.070]  And I think one of the core things of tyranny is a control over language, and not only the censorship,
[02:46:35.842 --> 02:46:47.138]  The control, the creation, the revision, the editing of it, and I don't know if you know who has control over our English language.
[02:46:48.208 --> 02:46:51.830]  Well, of course, the dictionary itself is not going to shrink.
[02:46:51.830 --> 02:47:06.599]  It's not going to be like Orwell's 1984, where they had the annual Newspeak Dictionary, where they removed words for the express purpose of constraining people's ability to think and be critical and dissent against the state.
[02:47:07.259 --> 02:47:15.163]  What we're seeing is this politically correct move to denounce certain words and say that you can't use certain words such as the word retarded.
[02:47:15.163 --> 02:47:22.006]  I mean for years these feminists, these social justice warriors have been on Twitter saying you can't use the word retarded for anything.
[02:47:22.006 --> 02:47:25.348]  Of course if you ask most disabled people they don't really care.
[02:47:25.348 --> 02:47:29.930]  It's these social justice warriors getting offended on behalf of other people
[02:47:30.530 --> 02:47:33.532]  And then they try and redefine the meaning of words.
[02:47:33.532 --> 02:47:39.034]  So if you talk about feminism, people say, oh, how could you dare to disagree with feminism?
[02:47:39.034 --> 02:47:40.835]  It just means equality, right?
[02:47:40.835 --> 02:47:42.556]  Just look it up in the dictionary.
[02:47:42.556 --> 02:47:45.017]  It means equality of the sexes.
[02:47:45.017 --> 02:47:47.798]  It doesn't matter what it says in the dictionary.
[02:47:47.798 --> 02:47:53.741]  If you're taking that word, that concept, and applying it in a completely different way, then you're changing the meaning.
[02:47:53.741 --> 02:47:56.903]  So feminists take feminism, turn it into radical feminism.
[02:47:57.623 --> 02:47:59.865]  And it becomes about the supremacy of women.
[02:47:59.865 --> 02:48:03.127]  It becomes about misandry, man-hating.
[02:48:03.127 --> 02:48:05.829]  So it doesn't matter what it says in the dictionary.
[02:48:05.829 --> 02:48:15.856]  Modern third-wave feminism is not about equality based on the way feminists behave themselves and how they apply third-wave radical feminism.
[02:48:15.856 --> 02:48:21.720]  So that's how they're changing the meaning of words, dumbing us down, telling us we can't say certain things.
[02:48:21.720 --> 02:48:24.762]  And that's the new breed of political correctness that threatens free speech.
[02:48:25.849 --> 02:48:27.830]  We've got Justin in Pennsylvania.
[02:48:27.830 --> 02:48:28.350]  You're on the air.
[02:48:28.350 --> 02:48:31.091]  Go ahead, Justin.
[02:48:31.091 --> 02:48:32.191]  Hello?
[02:48:32.191 --> 02:48:32.952]  Yeah, you're on the air.
[02:48:32.952 --> 02:48:34.913]  Go ahead.
[02:48:34.913 --> 02:48:37.954]  Yes, I was just talking about a serious situation.
[02:48:37.954 --> 02:48:46.137]  As far as Putin, what are you guys' view on Putin?
[02:48:46.137 --> 02:48:50.458]  Is he in with a new world order?
[02:48:50.458 --> 02:48:51.879]  I read these New American magazines.
[02:48:54.458 --> 02:49:09.972]  There were a number of statements I believe a couple of years ago from top elitists within America, I think I remember writing an article about this, that Putin's actions in Crimea and towards Ukraine meant that he had been basically severed, kicked out of the quote
[02:49:10.592 --> 02:49:13.615]  You know, New World Order, the Anglo-American establishment.
[02:49:13.615 --> 02:49:27.105]  So I genuinely believe that he's trying to lead this multipolar world in opposition to the unipolar world and that's why there's such a big clash with regard to Syria, with regard to Turkey and the downing of this jet.
[02:49:27.105 --> 02:49:29.988]  So no, I don't think Putin's part of the New World Order.
[02:49:29.988 --> 02:49:36.093]  I think he, not that he's a good guy obviously, but he stands steadfast against that based on his actions over the past
[02:49:36.673 --> 02:49:37.994]  A couple of years.
[02:49:37.994 --> 02:49:43.136]  We're going to go to more of your calls, maybe squeeze in another one after the break.
[02:49:43.136 --> 02:49:56.843]  Again, we were talking about these Syrian journalists, these Turkish journalists, who are being put in prison, beheaded, killed in mysterious circumstances for criticising the corrupt government of Turkey.
[02:49:56.843 --> 02:50:04.007]  The son of the President of Turkey is the main guy running the ISIS, the looted ISIS oil supplies.
[02:50:04.007 --> 02:50:04.988]  That's now coming out.
[02:50:06.008 --> 02:50:07.929]  So it's basically a deluge now.
[02:50:07.929 --> 02:50:18.995]  I mean, this was rumbling before the shoot-down of the Russian jet, but now it's pouring out in waves the fact how deep this alliance runs between Turkey and ISIS.
[02:50:18.995 --> 02:50:25.318]  Another article out of the Telegraph, Barack Obama plans to defeat ISIS dismissed by US intelligence experts.
[02:50:25.318 --> 02:50:32.581]  President Barack Obama's attempts to destroy ISIL has been derided by Western diplomats and his own former intelligence officials.
[02:50:32.581 --> 02:50:33.702]  And again, it goes to the point,
[02:50:34.222 --> 02:50:42.505]  And the New York Times came out and said that they basically tried to cover up the fact for 15 months that it was never designed to destroy ISIS.
[02:50:42.505 --> 02:50:47.986]  They held back on bombing the oil tankers, the oil fields, for 15 months.
[02:50:47.986 --> 02:50:52.107]  Specifically because they wanted to keep ISIS in the region to overthrow Assad.
[02:50:52.107 --> 02:50:52.868]  We'll be back.
[02:50:52.868 --> 02:50:56.509]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show live in fogforce.com.
[02:50:56.509 --> 02:50:57.049]  Stay tuned.

[02:51:30.066 --> 02:51:31.847]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:51:31.847 --> 02:51:33.488]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:51:33.488 --> 02:51:36.309]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:51:36.309 --> 02:51:38.610]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:51:38.610 --> 02:51:43.111]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[02:53:00.612 --> 02:53:05.253]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[02:53:05.253 --> 02:53:09.534]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[02:53:09.534 --> 02:53:10.915]  We typically do the same thing.
[02:53:10.915 --> 02:53:13.936]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[02:53:13.936 --> 02:53:16.156]  But have you considered heat storage?
[02:53:16.156 --> 02:53:18.357]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[02:53:18.357 --> 02:53:20.658]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[02:53:20.658 --> 02:53:22.298]  How will I keep my family warm?
[02:53:22.298 --> 02:53:24.779]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[02:53:24.779 --> 02:53:28.840]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[02:53:29.660 --> 02:53:30.781]  Another concern?
[02:53:30.781 --> 02:53:34.763]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[02:53:34.763 --> 02:53:37.344]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[02:53:37.344 --> 02:53:41.326]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[02:53:41.326 --> 02:53:44.128]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[02:53:44.128 --> 02:53:48.770]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[02:53:48.770 --> 02:53:50.771]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[02:53:50.771 --> 02:53:52.432]  FortressClothing.com.
[02:53:52.432 --> 02:53:53.773]  You'll never be cold again.
[02:54:13.270 --> 02:54:16.531]  On the Alex Jones Show, we've got the fourth hour coming up.
[02:54:16.531 --> 02:54:19.091]  Breaking news though, up on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:54:19.091 --> 02:54:20.212]  Red-linked.
[02:54:20.212 --> 02:54:24.632]  Active shooter situation reported near Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs.
[02:54:24.632 --> 02:54:27.013]  Reports of multiple people shot.
[02:54:27.737 --> 02:54:31.901]  An active shooter was reported near a Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs.
[02:54:31.901 --> 02:54:35.724]  The office is 3480 Centennial Boulevard.
[02:54:35.724 --> 02:54:43.110]  Scanner traffic indicated at least two officers were down, one near a dumpster and another taken by ambulance to hospital.
[02:54:43.110 --> 02:54:52.078]  A dispatcher said one patient was wounded and basically several wounded at least in this shooting, officers down.
[02:54:52.078 --> 02:54:54.020]  That report is just coming out of course.
[02:54:54.935 --> 02:55:00.599]  If this pans out to what it looks like it's going to be, the left is going to be gleefully rubbing its hands together.
[02:55:00.599 --> 02:55:19.952]  We've had the whole debate about defunding Planned Parenthood for months now in the aftermath of this series of videos produced by the Center for Medical Progress, which of course have completely demolished the reputation of Planned Parenthood and led to this drive in Congress to defund the organization.
[02:55:19.952 --> 02:55:22.453]  Rob, I'm sure you'll be picking up on that in the fourth hour.
[02:55:22.453 --> 02:55:24.595]  What else do you have for us in the fourth hour?
[02:55:25.095 --> 02:55:27.156]  Yeah, I just saw that as well during the break.
[02:55:27.156 --> 02:55:32.979]  I started printing out the articles from that shooting in Colorado Springs.
[02:55:32.979 --> 02:55:39.042]  It looks like Planned Parenthood is going to get a chance to play the victim out of this saying, see look at what the horrible gun owners have done.
[02:55:39.042 --> 02:55:40.982]  So we'll see how that all plays out.
[02:55:40.982 --> 02:55:48.266]  And we'll end up seeing if it's a white male that everybody's warning us about who was the shooter or if they'll ever even find the shooter.
[02:55:48.946 --> 02:55:51.448]  But I'm also going to look at a couple other things.
[02:55:51.448 --> 02:55:53.970]  We're going to be playing some Black Friday reports.
[02:55:53.970 --> 02:55:58.954]  John Bowne just put one up in my email, so we're going to be playing that one.
[02:55:58.954 --> 02:56:01.976]  It's a new one about the complete idiocy of Black Friday.
[02:56:01.976 --> 02:56:06.500]  And we played this report a few days ago, and I might revisit part of it again.
[02:56:06.500 --> 02:56:16.768]  We went out, Liam McAdoo went out and talked to people about Black Friday and if we should change it to something more hospitable like Gift Purchasing Friday, and a lot of people were thinking that
[02:56:17.068 --> 02:56:19.410]  Black Friday is racist and should be changed.
[02:56:19.410 --> 02:56:20.811]  The name should be changed.
[02:56:20.811 --> 02:56:24.794]  So I'm also going to be showing you guys some Hillary Clinton.
[02:56:24.794 --> 02:56:27.436]  We're having this Hillary Clinton contest to make fun of Hillary.
[02:56:27.436 --> 02:56:31.580]  Because if we don't exercise our right to free speech, we are going to lose it.
[02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:39.006]  As you can see with the guest that we had earlier today, the guy who made a tweet just saying he didn't agree with feminists is now being attacked and sued.
[02:56:39.566 --> 02:56:40.986]  And could face prison time.
[02:56:40.986 --> 02:56:45.988]  So we're having this Hillary, make fun of Hillary Clinton contest to defend the First Amendment.
[02:56:45.988 --> 02:56:50.009]  I'm going to have three examples of the contests that people have sent in.
[02:56:50.009 --> 02:56:52.590]  I've been checking my email for that all weekend.
[02:56:52.590 --> 02:56:54.410]  And some pretty funny entries.
[02:56:54.410 --> 02:56:58.231]  So we're going to show them to you guys and then I'll take some calls.
[02:56:58.231 --> 02:56:59.732]  So that's what we'll be looking at.
[02:56:59.732 --> 02:57:03.553]  I'll definitely be on this active shooter in Colorado Springs situation.
[02:57:03.553 --> 02:57:04.353]  We'll see what's going on there.
[02:57:05.540 --> 02:57:09.103]  Yeah, obviously we hope that no one was seriously hurt.
[02:57:09.103 --> 02:57:21.034]  If there are fatalities, that's going to blow up into a huge media narrative about how anyone who criticises Planned Parenthood sides with this maniacal shooter, whoever he turns out to be.
[02:57:21.995 --> 02:57:23.756]  So again, I hope no one's seriously hurt.
[02:57:23.756 --> 02:57:26.078]  We'll continue to monitor that.
[02:57:26.078 --> 02:57:27.880]  Final story here out of the Daily Caller.
[02:57:27.880 --> 02:57:36.548]  Persian Muslim Gulf states have accepted no Syrian refugees, while the United States and Europe argue over how many Syrian refugees to allow in.
[02:57:36.548 --> 02:57:43.755]  The richest Persian Gulf states have accepted exactly zero, still to this day.
[02:57:43.755 --> 02:57:46.898]  In fact, you had Saudi Arabia had the recent Hajj pilgrimage.
[02:57:47.558 --> 02:57:55.009]  They've got tents that can house 300,000 people that are empty for 51 weeks of the year and they're not using them.
[02:57:55.009 --> 02:58:03.782]  And the reasons given for not allowing these refugees into these Gulf Arab states, which are wealthy and rich and can take care of them, is that they fear terrorism
[02:58:04.282 --> 02:58:07.664]  They fear that they won't be integrated into society.
[02:58:07.664 --> 02:58:16.669]  Meanwhile, even as Germany's top police chief warns that ISIS is hiding among refugees entering Europe, we have to accept them.
[02:58:16.669 --> 02:58:20.992]  We have to roll out the red carpet without any questions whatsoever.
[02:58:20.992 --> 02:58:28.216]  And people who criticize that are now being hunted down as thought criminals on Facebook by the German ex-Stasi.
[02:58:28.216 --> 02:58:29.416]  That's the situation.
[02:58:29.416 --> 02:58:30.197]  That's how bad it's got.
[02:58:30.777 --> 02:58:32.940]  Fourth hour with Rob Jew coming up.
[02:58:32.940 --> 02:58:33.520]  Stay tuned.
[02:58:33.520 --> 02:58:34.762]  That's going to wrap it up.
[02:58:34.762 --> 02:58:39.407]  Again, breaking news at InfoWars.com.

[02:59:41.091 --> 02:59:43.112]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:59.915 --> 03:00:05.331]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:05.331 --> 03:00:07.617]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:00:13.047 --> 03:00:13.627]  We are back.
[03:00:13.627 --> 03:00:14.848]  It's the 4th Hour of Overdrive.
[03:00:14.848 --> 03:00:15.808]  I'm your host, Rob Dew.
[03:00:15.808 --> 03:00:17.529]  I'll be with you for the next hour.
[03:00:17.529 --> 03:00:23.471]  I'm going to be explaining, I guess, bringing you up to date on what's going on with the shooting situation in Colorado Springs.
[03:00:23.471 --> 03:00:29.153]  It appears as if the shooter has barricaded in Planned Parenthood and has multiple victims.
[03:00:29.153 --> 03:00:30.714]  That's Mike Violette.
[03:00:31.474 --> 03:00:32.235]  Tweeting that.
[03:00:32.235 --> 03:00:34.897]  I'm going to be pulling all these tweets up and showing them to you.
[03:00:34.897 --> 03:00:36.137]  That's from the Independent guys.
[03:00:36.137 --> 03:00:37.098]  If y'all can pull that one up.
[03:00:37.098 --> 03:00:43.383]  Independent Colorado Springs shoots multiple people including police officer at Planned Parenthood Clinic.
[03:00:43.383 --> 03:00:57.613]  Now what was funny, not funny about this, but when we went to a Planned Parenthood Clinic to protest, which is what we are obligated to do in defense of the unborn child, children out there, we were attacked by this pack of communists that
[03:00:57.913 --> 03:00:58.373]  I don't
[03:01:24.252 --> 03:01:25.293]  Grabbing microphones.
[03:01:25.293 --> 03:01:29.815]  They ripped a microphone out of Alex Jones' hand and then proceeded to run away.
[03:01:29.815 --> 03:01:31.697]  But just distasteful tactics.
[03:01:31.697 --> 03:01:41.383]  And of course, something like this, a shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic is distasteful and we definitely don't agree with that here at InfoWars.
[03:01:41.383 --> 03:01:48.087]  And hopefully nobody is seriously hurt, but it appears that the gunman may be barricaded inside and we'll be bringing you more information about this.
[03:01:48.667 --> 03:01:49.087]  I think?
[03:02:05.601 --> 03:02:08.822]  The Army is testing remote-controlled weapons towers.
[03:02:08.822 --> 03:02:17.845]  So all these devices being built are going to have their own type of command system, which will either, you know, it's going to look at things.
[03:02:17.845 --> 03:02:24.127]  If you don't have the right biometric, if you don't have the right walk, if they perceive any type of threat, they may open fire on you.
[03:02:24.887 --> 03:02:28.668]  Whether you're, you know, whether you need to be open fire on or not.
[03:02:28.668 --> 03:02:37.092]  So that is really concerning and that just brings to mind these Terminator robot scenarios that we've seen movies about and just this is the beginning of it.
[03:02:37.092 --> 03:02:42.554]  We're now seeing like, I guess this is the first inning of this robot situation we're in.
[03:02:42.554 --> 03:02:44.855]  I'm going to be playing a report also from John Bowne.
[03:02:44.855 --> 03:02:48.096]  Why celebrating Black Friday means you're a complete idiot?
[03:02:49.161 --> 03:02:50.282]  No.
[03:02:50.282 --> 03:02:56.407]  I don't think you're an idiot if you go to InfoWarsStore.com and check out the Black Friday deals we have because they are real deals.
[03:02:56.407 --> 03:03:10.319]  We've got $9.95 silver bullets, storable food at some amazingly low prices, Secret 12, Brain Force both at 30% off, Super Male and Super Female Vitality at 25% off, and DNA Force at 33% off.
[03:03:10.319 --> 03:03:12.021]  Plus, we're going to have free shipping.
[03:03:12.481 --> 03:03:14.342]  All this is going through the weekend.
[03:03:14.342 --> 03:03:17.884]  Some amazing stocking stuffers and some 99 cent DVDs.
[03:03:17.884 --> 03:03:25.828]  If you haven't given the gift of an Alex Jones DVD to one of your relatives, you should do so and then watch their reaction.
[03:03:25.828 --> 03:03:27.229]  Amazing reaction.
[03:03:27.229 --> 03:03:28.290]  Also, I'm going to be playing some
[03:03:30.091 --> 03:03:37.056]  Some entries into the Hillary Clinton video contest we're having here at Infowars.com.
[03:03:37.056 --> 03:03:39.398]  $6,000 in cash prizes.
[03:03:39.398 --> 03:03:47.064]  $5,000 first place, $1,000 second place, and third place receives a Hillary for Prison t-shirt along with the Hillary laughing pin.
[03:03:49.105 --> 03:03:55.949]  Certainly that prize is worth worth its weight in gold, but we have a video there You can watch Alex Jones telling you all about the contest.
[03:03:55.949 --> 03:04:02.712]  We have the list of Rules right here is the official rules, so we're gonna be playing some of those today and
[03:04:04.153 --> 03:04:05.094]  I think that's about it.
[03:04:05.094 --> 03:04:06.596]  Maybe I'll take some of your phone calls.
[03:04:06.596 --> 03:04:08.318]  I think in the next segment I'll start with that.
[03:04:08.318 --> 03:04:11.142]  We're going to get into Jon Bowne's video about Black Friday.
[03:04:11.142 --> 03:04:12.764]  And also I'll take some of your calls.
[03:04:12.764 --> 03:04:20.793]  We'll be discussing this robot war that we're going to be launching, not hopefully soon in the near future, but man, it really does concern me.
[03:04:22.065 --> 03:04:28.611]  That the armies of the world are creating robot drones that have guns.
[03:04:28.611 --> 03:04:31.474]  It's definitely disconcerting out there.
[03:04:31.474 --> 03:04:37.159]  So, all that and more on today's 4th Hour of the InfoWars.com Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:37.159 --> 03:04:38.040]  I'm your host Rob Dood.
[03:04:38.040 --> 03:04:39.641]  This is the 4th Hour of Overdrive.
[03:04:39.641 --> 03:04:40.082]  Stay tuned.
[03:04:58.681 --> 03:05:09.349]  The latest rich person who lives a life of luxury in one of their many houses, travels in private jets, but is telling you that you have to cut out every modern convenience in your life, is the King of Sweden.
[03:05:09.349 --> 03:05:10.169]  That's right.
[03:05:10.169 --> 03:05:20.717]  King Carl Gustaf, who has a reputation of being quite a ladies' man, has now called for a ban on bass, and admits he is ashamed to run one after realizing how much energy they use.
[03:05:20.717 --> 03:05:22.278]  I am laughing while I'm reading this.
[03:05:22.278 --> 03:05:22.738]  That is right.
[03:05:22.898 --> 03:05:27.360]  To show how eco-friendly he is, he also drives a hybrid car.
[03:05:27.360 --> 03:05:30.421]  And he's using low-energy light bulbs.
[03:05:30.421 --> 03:05:31.941]  Now that's where it gets absurd.
[03:05:31.941 --> 03:05:38.344]  Back in Canada, anyone who admits carbon will pay, Alberta says, as it releases tough climate change policies.
[03:05:38.344 --> 03:05:43.986]  Which includes a mandate that two-thirds of coal-fired electricity generation be replaced with renewables by 2030.
[03:05:43.986 --> 03:05:47.547]  The Guardian is reporting, no pets, no kids, no flights.
[03:05:47.547 --> 03:05:50.048]  How readers are reducing their carbon footprint.
[03:05:50.208 --> 03:05:53.990]  Yes, in fact, there are some people out there that actually believe this garbage.
[03:05:53.990 --> 03:05:58.513]  Rob Dew, reporting for InfoWars Nightly News, thanks for watching.

[03:08:01.579 --> 03:08:08.208]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:08.208 --> 03:08:11.191]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:16.781 --> 03:08:19.862]  We are back live with the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:08:19.862 --> 03:08:20.762]  Happy Black Friday.
[03:08:20.762 --> 03:08:21.863]  Hope you had a great Thanksgiving.
[03:08:21.863 --> 03:08:23.303]  I'm your host, Rob Dew.
[03:08:23.303 --> 03:08:24.784]  I'm going to be taking your calls later.
[03:08:24.784 --> 03:08:28.966]  Tell me what you're thankful for, or what you're not thankful for.
[03:08:28.966 --> 03:08:36.108]  Maybe it's the intruding government that wants to control every aspect of your life and tax the bejesus out of you in the process.
[03:08:36.108 --> 03:08:40.750]  I've got a caller from Paris I'm going to go to right after we play this video, so stay tight.
[03:08:40.750 --> 03:08:42.170]  I think it's Waleed in Paris.
[03:08:42.170 --> 03:08:43.471]  He wants to talk about the Paris attacks.
[03:08:44.091 --> 03:08:45.737]  Stay on the line with us, buddy.
[03:08:45.737 --> 03:08:47.603]  We will be with you right after this report.
[03:08:51.440 --> 03:08:57.301]  Some Black Friday deals, there they are opening the floodgates and everybody's mobbing in to get their free goodies.
[03:08:57.301 --> 03:08:59.182]  We have a report coming up from John Bowne.
[03:08:59.182 --> 03:09:01.783]  Black Friday is now unofficially a global holiday phenomenon.
[03:09:01.783 --> 03:09:10.105]  The day after Thanksgiving, that harkens the beginning of the month-long celebration of consumerism, regardless of the fact that Americans can't even afford the holiday system.
[03:09:10.105 --> 03:09:13.225]  62% have less than $1,000 in savings and 21% don't have any savings at all.
[03:09:16.252 --> 03:09:25.754]  And for instance, the mega soul-sucking Walmart chains deliver Chinese goods to the most depleted American population, while slave-wage Walmart employees are subsidized by our tax dollars.
[03:09:25.754 --> 03:09:31.636]  And he talks about the history of this as well, how it goes back to the 19th century gold swindling conspiracy.
[03:09:31.636 --> 03:09:33.076]  So we're going to get into all that.
[03:09:33.076 --> 03:09:41.538]  And he ends it with, of course, Merry Christmas zombies, because there they are right there looking for their free goods, our cheap goods.
[03:09:41.538 --> 03:09:44.799]  I mean, this is just crazy what we've become and how this is all
[03:09:45.796 --> 03:09:52.962]  Just meant to condition us to buy these products that have little or no significance in your life overall.
[03:09:52.962 --> 03:09:59.868]  So that is, you can watch more of that, just type in Black Friday Madness in YouTube and you can find other people that have put up videos.
[03:09:59.868 --> 03:10:02.510]  So let's go now to Jon Bowne's report and then we're gonna go to our caller from Paris.
[03:10:07.699 --> 03:10:12.200]  Black Friday is now unofficially a global holiday phenomenon.
[03:10:12.200 --> 03:10:17.542]  The day after Thanksgiving that harkens the beginning of the month-long celebration of consumerism.
[03:10:17.542 --> 03:10:23.103]  Regardless of the fact that most Americans can't even afford the holiday season.
[03:10:23.103 --> 03:10:27.164]  62% of Americans have less than a thousand dollars in savings.
[03:10:27.164 --> 03:10:30.465]  And 21% don't have savings at all.
[03:10:30.465 --> 03:10:33.666]  Sales expected to reach 80 billion dollars in the U.S.
[03:10:35.489 --> 03:10:36.270]  We made it!
[03:10:36.270 --> 03:10:40.274]  The average American spending close to $400 throughout the holiday weekend.
[03:10:40.274 --> 03:10:46.761]  While the mega soul-sucking Walmart chains deliver Chinese goods to most of the depleted American population.
[03:10:46.761 --> 03:10:51.807]  While slave wage Walmart employees are subsidized by our tax dollars.
[03:10:51.807 --> 03:10:57.433]  Allowing the Scrooge Walton family to rip out the heart of America and crush small business.
[03:10:57.833 --> 03:11:03.995]  The irony is that Black Friday stems from a 19th century gold swindling conspiracy.
[03:11:03.995 --> 03:11:12.398]  And now, in the name of almighty consumerism, Americans are being swindled out of their last dimes, ethics, and common sense.
[03:11:12.398 --> 03:11:13.679]  I'm a heavy consumer.
[03:11:13.679 --> 03:11:18.680]  And you know, I'm concerned about what my children consume.
[03:11:18.680 --> 03:11:24.182]  I'd like to consume the barrel of a 12-gauge shotgun right now, if I could.
[03:11:24.182 --> 03:11:25.923]  Thank you, because I'm in hell.
[03:11:26.463 --> 03:11:38.786]  Black Friday is a complete scam based around the manifestly provable hoax that consumers are getting huge discounts on products that would normally be more expensive at any other time of year.
[03:11:38.786 --> 03:11:46.888]  In reality, stores enjoy higher profit margins during the holiday period because retailers artificially inflate prices of goods
[03:11:47.288 --> 03:11:54.054]  In the months before Black Friday, in order to make the subsequent discounts look good in comparison.
[03:11:54.054 --> 03:12:03.363]  As the Wall Street Journal highlights, the idea of Black Friday discounts is a complete hoax, achieved via the process of price massaging throughout the rest of the year.
[03:12:03.983 --> 03:12:10.245]  The scam also relies on shoppers' impulse, buying another product that has a 98% markup value.
[03:12:10.245 --> 03:12:19.227]  So even if the first item represents a genuine discount, the vastly inflated price of the impulse purchase more than makes up for it.
[03:12:19.227 --> 03:12:27.470]  In many cases, the supposedly great deals that people will sacrifice endless hours of their time camping outside stores to take advantage of
[03:12:28.070 --> 03:12:34.615]  Are already available online anyway and can be found for even cheaper in January.
[03:12:34.615 --> 03:12:43.323]  But hey, nothing says Christmas like braving the cold on Thanksgiving night to rip a vegetable steamer out of the hands of an innocent little kid.
[03:12:53.638 --> 03:13:04.102]  What is behind the horrifying phenomenon of Black Friday and other extreme consumerist riots?
[03:13:04.102 --> 03:13:07.544]  What is behind it is the madness of a lost society.
[03:13:07.544 --> 03:13:09.925]  People that believe in hype.
[03:13:09.925 --> 03:13:13.106]  People that believe in mainstream media lies.
[03:13:13.106 --> 03:13:17.968]  Folks that don't know that Black Friday is one of the worst days of the year to go out and find sales.
[03:13:17.968 --> 03:13:20.649]  These are the same type of crowds that believe in Obamacare.
[03:13:21.570 --> 03:13:24.193]  And thought that it would really be a free ride.
[03:13:24.193 --> 03:13:26.496]  Or who go and buy lottery tickets.
[03:13:26.496 --> 03:13:29.159]  That's their future business plan.
[03:13:29.159 --> 03:13:31.022]  That's their retirement plan.
[03:13:31.022 --> 03:13:33.585]  These are born suckers.
[03:13:33.585 --> 03:13:36.648]  And statistically, there are more and more of them.
[03:13:36.648 --> 03:13:38.791]  Merry Christmas, zombies.
[03:13:38.791 --> 03:13:40.934]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[03:13:46.949 --> 03:13:54.673]  And of course we ended that report with the evil, racist, misogynist saying of Merry Christmas, which I think is another report we're going to go out and do.
[03:13:54.673 --> 03:13:56.574]  Talk to people about, do they say Merry Christmas?
[03:13:56.574 --> 03:13:57.695]  Do they say Happy Holidays?
[03:13:57.695 --> 03:13:59.075]  Do they say Happy Kwanzaa?
[03:13:59.075 --> 03:14:00.176]  Do they say Happy Hanukkah?
[03:14:00.176 --> 03:14:01.396]  What do they say?
[03:14:01.396 --> 03:14:10.721]  And if someone approaches them with something that's not of their faith, do they freak out and recoil and basically melt in a pool of their own ooze?
[03:14:10.721 --> 03:14:15.364]  It just really makes you wonder all the political correctness we're going on and
[03:14:16.284 --> 03:14:16.584]  I am.
[03:14:16.584 --> 03:14:17.985]  How are you, Rob?
[03:14:17.985 --> 03:14:20.207]  Hey, well, I'm so happy to talk to you.
[03:14:20.207 --> 03:14:24.230]  I mean, I've never talked to you personally, and I've seen that you're a great guy.
[03:14:24.230 --> 03:14:32.917]  But I'll just say that I called the other day when it was just the next day after the Paris attacks, and I talked to Alex.
[03:14:32.917 --> 03:14:33.818]  He was running the show.
[03:14:45.933 --> 03:14:55.910]  And we were just talking about gun control in Paris and all that stuff, and Alex brought up Albert Pike and the planned war between Jews, Christians, and Muslims.
[03:14:55.910 --> 03:14:59.416]  So first, I wanted to ask you, Rob, are you a believer in the God of Abraham?
[03:15:00.734 --> 03:15:03.016]  Am I a believer of the God of Abraham?
[03:15:03.016 --> 03:15:06.120]  Are you talking about the Christian God?
[03:15:06.120 --> 03:15:08.122]  Is that what you're referring to?
[03:15:08.122 --> 03:15:11.025]  Are you a believer in God?
[03:15:11.025 --> 03:15:14.308]  Yes, definitely.
[03:15:14.308 --> 03:15:20.095]  I've been listening to you guys for more than 7 years now, since I was a college student.
[03:15:20.975 --> 03:15:31.241]  And I'm a listener and a very frequent customer of InfoWars Life and I know how close you and Alex are, specifically you two.
[03:15:31.241 --> 03:15:39.125]  So just please allow me to state something related to this topic of Albert Pike's and the war between religions.
[03:15:39.125 --> 03:15:42.947]  Rob, I'm 100% certain, I've been following this and I'm 100% certain
[03:15:44.228 --> 03:15:48.130]  That Paul Joseph Watson is leading an anti-Islam propaganda.
[03:15:48.130 --> 03:15:50.650]  He loves to cite verses out of their context.
[03:15:50.650 --> 03:15:54.532]  And just Rob, just please go and check the translation of the word Islam.
[03:15:54.532 --> 03:15:55.632]  Just check it out.
[03:15:55.632 --> 03:15:58.153]  It means peace and it means submission to God.
[03:15:58.153 --> 03:16:03.835]  So I don't know what is making him and what is making Alex letting him do this.
[03:16:03.835 --> 03:16:07.857]  I would love to hear an answer from you because I know that you could speak on behalf of Alex.
[03:16:07.857 --> 03:16:08.197]  Thank you.
[03:16:08.757 --> 03:16:11.678]  Well, I cannot speak on behalf of Alex.
[03:16:11.678 --> 03:16:15.900]  Alex speaks on behalf of himself, and I will say this about Islam.
[03:16:15.900 --> 03:16:18.341]  Somebody sent me a video, and it was made in 2014.
[03:16:18.341 --> 03:16:27.605]  You guys might even be able to pull it up, but it was in Norway, and it's at a Muslim, I don't know if it's a prayer meeting or get-together, whatever they're having.
[03:16:27.605 --> 03:16:38.250]  It was a room full of people who claim to be Muslims, and they're being led by a guy, and he says, you know, how many of you are moderate, consider yourselves moderate Muslims, and 90% of them raise their hands.
[03:16:38.530 --> 03:16:41.892]  And then he talks about the punishments that are listed in the Quran.
[03:16:41.892 --> 03:16:48.495]  He talks about stoning, cutting off limbs, how many people believe in those, and they raise their hands.
[03:16:48.495 --> 03:16:48.955]  Every one of them.
[03:16:48.955 --> 03:16:55.498]  He goes, so see, you know, people always complain that when we have these talks that we're bringing up extremists and radicals.
[03:16:55.498 --> 03:16:58.440]  And he goes, these people aren't extremists and radical.
[03:16:58.440 --> 03:17:02.142]  And so that's what he's saying that their religion believes in.
[03:17:02.142 --> 03:17:03.422]  I tweeted that out.
[03:17:03.422 --> 03:17:05.903]  Yeah, there's actually the video right there.
[03:17:05.903 --> 03:17:06.964]  What's the title of that video?
[03:17:08.732 --> 03:17:10.393]  Yeah, the moderate Muslim.
[03:17:10.393 --> 03:17:12.134]  And it, I guess, took place in 2014.
[03:17:12.134 --> 03:17:22.119]  And I like to value people and look at people based on their actions and somewhat their words.
[03:17:22.119 --> 03:17:26.842]  I know a lot of people say stuff either that they don't mean or, you know, in the heat of the moment.
[03:17:26.842 --> 03:17:30.944]  But actions is really what I really, you know, judge people on.
[03:17:30.944 --> 03:17:31.825]  So when people
[03:17:33.243 --> 03:17:38.887]  Like the Islamic State are throwing people off roofs for their sexual orientation.
[03:17:38.887 --> 03:17:39.787]  I think that's wrong.
[03:17:39.787 --> 03:17:41.609]  And I don't think we should be doing that.
[03:17:41.609 --> 03:17:42.950]  I don't think anybody should be doing that.
[03:17:42.950 --> 03:17:49.734]  I think we should all be working together to make the species of man as good as it can be.
[03:17:49.734 --> 03:17:57.079]  And really launching ourselves into areas like better technologies, free energy even.
[03:17:57.079 --> 03:17:59.601]  You know, that's the areas that I think we should be working towards.
[03:17:59.601 --> 03:18:02.543]  Not about ninnying each other over our religious beliefs.
[03:18:03.503 --> 03:18:18.195]  And, um, so, but I don't speak for Alex, I don't speak for Paul Joseph Watson, but when I see videos like that, the moderate Muslim and these people are saying, you know, they believe in stoning, they believe in death for adultery, um, you know, I don't agree with that at all.
[03:18:18.195 --> 03:18:20.337]  And, uh, so that's, I guess that's where I stand on that.
[03:18:20.337 --> 03:18:23.840]  And thanks for calling, uh, Waleed in Paris.
[03:18:23.840 --> 03:18:27.603]  Uh, next we have Dogleg in Idaho wants to talk about Fukushima.
[03:18:27.603 --> 03:18:29.885]  Do you have some new news about Fukushima, Dogleg?
[03:18:31.334 --> 03:18:33.295]  Well, I kind of wanted to bring attention to it.
[03:18:33.295 --> 03:18:35.417]  First, I'd like to give a shout out to the people in Turkey.
[03:18:35.417 --> 03:18:36.497]  That was an amazing caller.
[03:18:36.497 --> 03:18:38.979]  And it's good to hear that they're awake.
[03:18:38.979 --> 03:18:40.280]  Just tell them, hang in there.
[03:18:40.280 --> 03:18:41.881]  We're winning.
[03:18:41.881 --> 03:18:44.542]  But I'd like to bring attention to Fukushima.
[03:18:44.542 --> 03:18:50.106]  There's a man named Dana Durnford, excuse me, in Canada.
[03:18:50.106 --> 03:18:58.671]  And Dana has recently been arrested for online threats to some scientists.
[03:19:02.284 --> 03:19:03.585]  And what are the nature of the threats?
[03:19:03.585 --> 03:19:07.507]  Are they saying, is Dana a guy or a girl?
[03:19:07.507 --> 03:19:08.228]  Dana's a guy.
[03:19:08.228 --> 03:19:16.853]  He spent his whole life on the ocean and he went and mapped the entire BC coastline here recently and he says the entire ocean's dead.
[03:19:18.157 --> 03:19:19.898]  I've been seeing a lot of reports about that.
[03:19:19.898 --> 03:19:24.541]  The melting starfish, the dead sea life that's washing up, especially on the west coast.
[03:19:24.541 --> 03:19:29.544]  People are going out to the beaches and they're saying they're not seeing the same wildlife that they used to see.
[03:19:29.544 --> 03:19:32.807]  There was a guy who was taking a sailboat across the Pacific.
[03:19:33.607 --> 03:19:35.808]  And he said, you know, that I'm in these dead zones.
[03:19:35.808 --> 03:19:37.449]  I don't know what's going on.
[03:19:37.449 --> 03:19:40.730]  So a lot of people are very concerned about what's going on.
[03:19:40.730 --> 03:19:43.071]  So this guy's been, I'm going to hold you over and let you finish up.
[03:19:43.071 --> 03:19:45.232]  This is the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:19:45.232 --> 03:19:46.553]  Thanks for joining us, Dogleg.
[03:19:46.553 --> 03:19:54.256]  And we'll be back right after this to talk about more about the, I guess, the fear mongering and whatnot that, uh, that I guess, I don't know.
[03:19:54.256 --> 03:19:56.337]  What, what is going on with Fukushima?
[03:19:56.337 --> 03:19:56.797]  We're going to find out.

[03:22:55.576 --> 03:22:57.277]  SupernaturalSilver.com.
[03:23:00.834 --> 03:23:05.478]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[03:23:05.478 --> 03:23:09.761]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[03:23:09.761 --> 03:23:11.143]  We typically do the same thing.
[03:23:11.143 --> 03:23:14.165]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[03:23:14.165 --> 03:23:16.387]  But have you considered heat storage?
[03:23:16.387 --> 03:23:18.589]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[03:23:18.589 --> 03:23:20.891]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[03:23:20.891 --> 03:23:22.532]  How will I keep my family warm?
[03:23:22.532 --> 03:23:25.014]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[03:23:25.014 --> 03:23:29.077]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[03:23:29.878 --> 03:23:30.999]  Another concern?
[03:23:30.999 --> 03:23:34.982]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[03:23:34.982 --> 03:23:37.564]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[03:23:37.564 --> 03:23:41.548]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[03:23:41.548 --> 03:23:44.350]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[03:23:44.350 --> 03:23:48.994]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[03:23:48.994 --> 03:23:51.015]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[03:23:51.015 --> 03:23:52.657]  FortressClothing.com.
[03:23:52.657 --> 03:23:53.998]  You'll never be cold again.
[03:24:13.860 --> 03:24:20.402]  So an issue we haven't looked at in a while is Fukushima and the radioactive fallout.
[03:24:20.402 --> 03:24:27.043]  I guess the seawater that they're using to cool down the meltdown rods is just being poured back into the ocean.
[03:24:27.043 --> 03:24:28.323]  It's leaking.
[03:24:28.323 --> 03:24:29.344]  We've seen the plumes.
[03:24:29.344 --> 03:24:30.784]  We've seen the animations of the plumes.
[03:24:30.784 --> 03:24:35.185]  We had a caller, Dogleg from Idaho, was talking about a man named Dana Dernford.
[03:24:36.005 --> 03:24:37.426]  And I did a quick search.
[03:24:37.426 --> 03:24:41.929]  Here's an update from 2015 of August.
[03:24:41.929 --> 03:24:46.813]  200 kilometers of Canadian Pacific coastline dead zone, devoid of 99% of all life.
[03:24:46.813 --> 03:24:51.036]  Almost all tidal zone species missing entirely.
[03:24:51.036 --> 03:24:52.737]  And Dogleg, I'm going to let you finish up.
[03:24:52.737 --> 03:24:56.020]  So this guy is being harassed by other scientists.
[03:24:56.020 --> 03:24:59.322]  They're claiming he's threatening them.
[03:24:59.322 --> 03:25:02.344]  Well, these so-called scientists, they've been downplaying it.
[03:25:02.344 --> 03:25:03.885]  You know, huge cover-up.
[03:25:03.885 --> 03:25:04.506]  We all know this.
[03:25:05.371 --> 03:25:14.505]  And they've, you know, kind of selectively taken some things he said online and used that to pretty much shut down his whole site and make him take down everything.
[03:25:14.505 --> 03:25:17.048]  He's facing some pretty serious charges now.
[03:25:18.632 --> 03:25:20.333]  Well, that's the problem with Canada.
[03:25:20.333 --> 03:25:26.658]  If you don't say the right things in Canada, they will throw the book at you and they'll allow other people to attack you if they don't like what you say.
[03:25:26.658 --> 03:25:37.806]  We just had the guest earlier, the lawyer for the man who's just disagreed with some feminists on Facebook and now he's being slammed and looking at jail time and fines.
[03:25:37.806 --> 03:25:42.570]  I mean, it's ridiculous what's going on with not being able to present two sides of an opinion.
[03:25:42.570 --> 03:25:45.953]  Why can't people disagree with other people and we still
[03:25:46.653 --> 03:25:51.214]  You know, get along and not have to do all this nonsense.
[03:25:51.214 --> 03:25:51.674]  Oh, yes.
[03:25:51.674 --> 03:25:56.335]  Many, many issues they're trying to shut down speech about worldwide, you know.
[03:25:56.335 --> 03:25:56.995]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[03:25:56.995 --> 03:25:59.795]  Do you have anything else you wanted to add?
[03:25:59.795 --> 03:26:05.016]  Uh, it's just, you know, the greatest lie Obama told was Fukushima when he got on TV.
[03:26:05.016 --> 03:26:12.017]  His family had already been flown to the Southern Hemisphere and he got on TV and told us it was all safe and he'd keep us informed.
[03:26:12.017 --> 03:26:15.758]  And then himself and Secretary Chu, the Energy Secretary,
[03:26:16.631 --> 03:26:23.016]  And, uh, the, uh, G, uh, G, uh, CEO, uh, what's his name?
[03:26:24.791 --> 03:26:30.713]  They all flew down there right afterwards, right after he gave that speech and, you know, stayed in the southern hemisphere until he got the all-clear.
[03:26:30.713 --> 03:26:31.353]  See you later.
[03:26:31.353 --> 03:26:32.173]  Everything's fine.
[03:26:32.173 --> 03:26:32.894]  We'll be back.
[03:26:32.894 --> 03:26:34.374]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:26:34.374 --> 03:26:35.594]  It's just crazy.
[03:26:35.594 --> 03:26:48.838]  And the thing with radiation is you don't know if it affects you unless you're wearing, you know, one of those little dosometers or you're next to a, you know, some sort of counter that could measure the radiation that you're being affected with.
[03:26:48.838 --> 03:26:50.699]  You're not going to know if that stuff's affecting you until
[03:26:51.039 --> 03:26:51.219]  I don't
[03:27:07.413 --> 03:27:12.455]  And these kids were playing in the creek, and everyone around them in their neighborhoods is winding up with cancer.
[03:27:12.455 --> 03:27:14.536]  They're having autoimmune disorders.
[03:27:14.536 --> 03:27:16.557]  So radiation is serious.
[03:27:16.557 --> 03:27:27.842]  And if Fukushima, you know, is really dumping millions of gallons of toxic radiation water into our Pacific Ocean, and it's the currents are carrying it this way.
[03:27:27.842 --> 03:27:29.182]  They're carrying it to Canada.
[03:27:29.182 --> 03:27:30.663]  They're carrying it to the coast of Alaska.
[03:27:30.663 --> 03:27:32.504]  They're carrying it to our West Coast.
[03:27:32.504 --> 03:27:34.625]  And if we're not straight with the people,
[03:27:35.305 --> 03:27:36.986]  About how dangerous this really is.
[03:27:36.986 --> 03:27:46.794]  We're doing everybody a disservice and that's why we sent a group of reporters out there when we were seeing high readings on some beaches in, I believe it was right around the San Francisco area.
[03:27:46.794 --> 03:27:48.396]  Appreciate the call, Dogleg.
[03:27:48.396 --> 03:27:51.158]  Ken in Washington, InfoWars Christmas.
[03:27:51.158 --> 03:27:54.060]  You want to talk about the true meaning of Christmas?
[03:27:54.060 --> 03:28:00.525]  Yeah, there's a really good documentary I've seen on YouTube over 10-12 years ago.
[03:28:00.525 --> 03:28:03.788]  It's by a Christian ministry called Jeremiah Films.
[03:28:04.608 --> 03:28:14.613]  And the DVD or the YouTube video, when he uploaded the DVD to YouTube, it's called The Unwrapping of Christmas.
[03:28:14.613 --> 03:28:16.694]  Okay.
[03:28:16.694 --> 03:28:18.936]  And it's totally satanic.
[03:28:18.936 --> 03:28:23.678]  Christmas is not, the word Christmas is pronounced Christ-mas.
[03:28:23.678 --> 03:28:30.982]  We see a big fat Catholic Santa Claus, Santa Claus in the corner of the street or inside the mall saying, ho ho ho, Merry Christmas.
[03:28:30.982 --> 03:28:32.983]  He's basically saying, mocking Jesus, he's saying,
[03:28:33.499 --> 03:28:36.380]  Ha, ha, ha, happy is Christ's death.
[03:28:36.380 --> 03:28:37.580]  Mass means the death of Christ.
[03:28:37.580 --> 03:28:40.161]  It does not mean the birth of Christ.
[03:28:40.161 --> 03:28:41.001]  It's satanic.
[03:28:41.001 --> 03:28:41.922]  It's always been satanic.
[03:28:41.922 --> 03:28:43.122]  It's Catholic.
[03:28:43.122 --> 03:28:45.883]  It's Antichrist.
[03:28:45.883 --> 03:28:52.445]  Also, there's a creature called Swartz Pete, also known as Krumpus.
[03:28:52.445 --> 03:28:57.006]  Krumpus is a little devil that follows this Catholic saint around.
[03:28:57.006 --> 03:28:58.967]  It's satanic.
[03:28:58.967 --> 03:29:03.128]  I understand that people want to share love and care about their kids and all that, but
[03:29:03.689 --> 03:29:09.194]  The Bible clearly says all on earth will be deceived by Satan.
[03:29:09.194 --> 03:29:14.738]  And I quit celebrating Christmas about 10-12 years ago because I'm not going to mock Jesus Christ.
[03:29:14.738 --> 03:29:17.280]  Jesus Christ is my King and Lord and Savior.
[03:29:17.280 --> 03:29:20.443]  I'm not going to celebrate these pagan, satanic holidays.
[03:29:20.443 --> 03:29:21.804]  It's Antichrist.
[03:29:21.804 --> 03:29:24.486]  What do they say?
[03:29:24.486 --> 03:29:26.728]  That little jingle that they sing?
[03:29:26.728 --> 03:29:28.109]  He knows when you're good or bad.
[03:29:28.109 --> 03:29:29.690]  It's like the NSA.
[03:29:29.690 --> 03:29:30.631]  He knows when you've been sleeping.
[03:29:30.631 --> 03:29:31.412]  He knows when you're awake.
[03:29:33.177 --> 03:29:38.380]  The Catholic Pope, or the Saint, or Santa Claus, is a replacement for Jesus Christ.
[03:29:38.380 --> 03:29:39.340]  He is anti-Christ.
[03:29:39.340 --> 03:29:41.421]  He is satanic.
[03:29:41.421 --> 03:29:44.662]  And he's supposed to be this man on Earth that's supposed to know when you're good or bad.
[03:29:44.662 --> 03:29:47.264]  Hey Ken, thanks for calling the Unwrapping of Christmas.
[03:29:47.264 --> 03:29:48.504]  We'll be back with more after this break.
[03:29:48.504 --> 03:29:49.244]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.244 --> 03:29:51.766]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.766 --> 03:29:54.447]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.364 --> 03:30:05.994]  While ISIS threatens to attack the U.S., a record number of illegal immigrants are flooding into the country thanks to lax enforcement by federal authorities.
[03:30:05.994 --> 03:30:10.100]  Barely a week after the November 2015 ISIS attacks in Paris, France, the U.S.
[03:30:10.100 --> 03:30:15.528]  Border Patrol revealed that nearly 3,000 unaccompanied children were caught crossing the border in the weeks leading up to the attacks.
[03:30:15.948 --> 03:30:19.813]  But just think of how many more illegal immigrants were able to slip into the country without getting caught.
[03:30:19.813 --> 03:30:21.675]  It's probably at least 10 times more.
[03:30:21.675 --> 03:30:29.323]  Speaking on the subject, House Representative Duncan Hunter said, quote, the greatest existential threat to this nation right now is this administration's open border policy.
[03:30:29.323 --> 03:30:30.765]  Hunter is speaking the truth.
[03:30:30.765 --> 03:30:36.632]  ISIS is likely already exploiting President Obama's open border policy to smuggle their own militants into the country.
[03:30:37.032 --> 03:30:38.673]  Here's something else you may not realize.
[03:30:38.673 --> 03:30:45.939]  Human traffickers are also taking advantage of Obama's open borders to enslave women around the world and import them as sex slaves into the U.S.
[03:30:45.939 --> 03:30:50.182]  In other words, Obama's lax enforcement of immigration laws is fueling a war on women.
[03:30:50.182 --> 03:30:56.867]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com and be sure to check back at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv for more reports.
[03:30:58.499 --> 03:31:02.022]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:31:02.022 --> 03:31:10.267]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:31:10.267 --> 03:31:15.691]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:31:15.691 --> 03:31:18.213]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[03:31:18.213 --> 03:31:20.334]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[03:31:28.453 --> 03:31:29.554]  BrainForce is here.
[03:31:29.554 --> 03:31:31.775]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:31:31.775 --> 03:31:36.758]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[03:31:36.758 --> 03:31:40.060]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:31:40.060 --> 03:31:43.542]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:31:43.542 --> 03:31:45.523]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:31:45.523 --> 03:31:47.645]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:31:47.645 --> 03:31:49.626]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[03:31:49.626 --> 03:31:55.229]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:31:58.942 --> 03:32:10.616]  My fellow patriots, anyone that listens to my broadcast for any length of time knows that I can't stand Black Friday, a mindless, idiotic exercise in pure blind consumerism.
[03:32:10.616 --> 03:32:11.838]  I'm for prosperity.
[03:32:11.838 --> 03:32:18.546]  I'm for having good products that make our lives better, but I don't just mindlessly worship the holiday where we're supposedly getting the best deal ever.
[03:32:18.746 --> 03:32:21.187]  And statistics show it's one of the worst days to shop.
[03:32:21.187 --> 03:32:28.891]  That's why we are taking the InfoWars to the next level and actually making InfoWarsStore.com Black Friday a super deal.
[03:32:28.891 --> 03:32:36.534]  Everything in the store gets free shipping right through the weekend on Black Friday and into next week.
[03:32:36.534 --> 03:32:43.677]  Storewide free shipping on everything and we're offering some of the best deals ever on nutraceuticals like DNA Force 33% off.
[03:32:44.858 --> 03:32:49.663]  You're getting super high quality products at the lowest prices and you're getting free shipping.
[03:32:49.663 --> 03:32:51.685]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:32:51.685 --> 03:32:55.909]  Check it out today or call 888-253-3139.
[03:32:55.909 --> 03:33:03.918]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:33:03.918 --> 03:33:06.700]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:12.555 --> 03:33:14.959]  I obsess over win-wins.
[03:33:14.959 --> 03:33:19.024]  And so I think I've got four different wins here that I'm going to break down on Black Friday.
[03:33:20.367 --> 03:33:30.693]  You can get incredible deals and free shipping storewide at InfoWareStore.com through Black Friday, through the weekend, and until next Monday.
[03:33:30.693 --> 03:33:39.317]  And at the same time, you can get informed by watching this video on the fact that most Black Friday sales are a scam.
[03:33:39.317 --> 03:33:44.440]  Companies simply raise prices the week before and then lower them the week of to normal prices.
[03:33:44.620 --> 03:33:44.840]  I think?
[03:34:14.720 --> 03:34:20.204]  We're exposing the fact that Black Friday itself is a big hoax.
[03:34:20.204 --> 03:34:27.810]  Black Friday itself is just a great time to get in traffic jams and to watch people acting like mindless consumer zombies.
[03:34:27.810 --> 03:34:39.098]  Now some people, when I talk about Black Friday, say, hey wait, you're criticizing the consumer zombies rushing Walmart or Target for video games or whatever, fighting over toilet paper, but then you're
[03:34:40.109 --> 03:34:42.110]  Talking about your own Black Friday.
[03:34:42.110 --> 03:34:43.251]  Well, yeah, that's what we do.
[03:34:43.251 --> 03:34:54.138]  We hijack globalist operations, try to educate people about them, and then try to take the attention that their scams are creating and siphon it off to wake people up.
[03:34:54.138 --> 03:34:55.259]  It's like culture jamming.
[03:34:55.259 --> 03:35:05.626]  It's like when I cover Miley Cyrus or Kim Kardashian, it's not because I'm trying to cover fluff, it's because I'm hijacking it, using their names to then expose the whole agenda.
[03:35:06.306 --> 03:35:29.858]  So, free shipping right through to next week, next Monday, and huge deals like 30% off Brain Force, 25% off Super Male and Female Vitality, 99-cent DVDs, over 20% off Storable Food, 30% off Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine, 33% off DNA Force, deep discounts on preparedness gear, and store-wide free shipping.
[03:35:29.858 --> 03:35:32.319]  The power you have to vote with your dollar is incredible.
[03:35:32.819 --> 03:35:38.543]  And you've seen what we've built here at InfoWars over the years because of the great work you've done supporting us.
[03:35:38.543 --> 03:35:40.544]  You don't stand behind us or beside us.
[03:35:40.544 --> 03:35:42.666]  You stand at the heart of our operation.
[03:35:42.666 --> 03:35:43.846]  You are the resistance.
[03:35:43.846 --> 03:35:47.049]  And it's great to have an audience that is free market, that understands that.
[03:35:47.049 --> 03:35:49.110]  So I want to salute you and thank you.
[03:35:49.110 --> 03:36:02.299]  Because whether it's a Hillary for Prison t-shirt to stand up for the First Amendment, or whether it's a water filtration system to cut out the glyphosate and fluoride out of your family's water, whether it's the incredible deep cleanse or oxy powder, whatever it is,
[03:36:03.079 --> 03:36:07.881]  They're all amazing game changers because people perish for lack of knowledge.
[03:36:07.881 --> 03:36:10.022]  This is a free will universe.
[03:36:10.022 --> 03:36:17.565]  This is a universe of free association and tyranny can never trump the free will and the actions you take.
[03:36:17.565 --> 03:36:20.746]  So I salute you on this Black Friday week.
[03:36:20.746 --> 03:36:22.107]  We are hijacking it.
[03:36:22.107 --> 03:36:26.028]  We are exposing it and we're helping take the info war into the black.
[03:36:26.028 --> 03:36:27.509]  So we have the funding we need.
[03:36:28.289 --> 03:36:42.175]  To continue on and hopefully even add a few more reporters and cover more of the election on the ground and really, really, really cover the news, really break big stories and really change the narrative away from globalist control to people-based information.
[03:36:42.175 --> 03:36:44.176]  This is teleprompter-free news, folks.
[03:36:44.176 --> 03:36:46.657]  This is teleprompter-free liberty.
[03:36:46.657 --> 03:36:49.078]  This is from the heart, directly to you.
[03:36:49.078 --> 03:36:53.580]  I'm Alex Jones signing off for InfoWars.com and InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:36:53.580 --> 03:36:55.481]  From myself and the rest of the InfoWars crew,
[03:36:56.081 --> 03:36:57.122]  You are family.
[03:36:57.122 --> 03:36:58.222]  We salute you.
[03:36:58.222 --> 03:37:00.163]  You built this operation.
[03:37:00.163 --> 03:37:03.565]  You are the Infowar.
[03:37:03.565 --> 03:37:15.531]  Let me tell you, I have seen the support grow and the audience grow since I've been here February 2009 when I first started as a producer for the show doing some basic editing.
[03:37:15.531 --> 03:37:19.533]  And I've moved up here in the ranks going on location to different areas.
[03:37:19.993 --> 03:37:23.856]  And we really, we could not send all the reporters out like we do without your support.
[03:37:23.856 --> 03:37:28.380]  So really do appreciate you supporting us and definitely check out the deals.
[03:37:28.380 --> 03:37:29.620]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:37:29.620 --> 03:37:33.924]  If you click in the center, there is a bar right there underneath the main menu bar.
[03:37:33.924 --> 03:37:35.785]  It says click here to access Mega Savings.
[03:37:35.785 --> 03:37:36.486]  It lists all of our
[03:37:37.046 --> 03:37:38.747]  Our prices, I'll go back and show you that again.
[03:37:38.747 --> 03:37:41.569]  For those of you watching Infowars.com forward slash show, there it is.
[03:37:41.569 --> 03:37:43.050]  You click on it, boom.
[03:37:43.050 --> 03:37:46.452]  Silver Bullet 995, Secret 12, 30% off.
[03:37:46.452 --> 03:37:48.413]  Got some amazing stocking stuffers.
[03:37:48.413 --> 03:37:53.257]  Check it out, it funds everything we do here and we're having free shipping all through the weekend.
[03:37:53.257 --> 03:37:55.278]  So you cannot beat some of these deals.
[03:37:55.278 --> 03:37:58.360]  Survival Shield X2, an amazing product.
[03:37:58.360 --> 03:38:04.124]  I take it several times a week, a drop or full, and just the energy that it's provided me.
[03:38:04.844 --> 03:38:10.673]  Helping keep the beer gut at bay, especially as you get up in my age.
[03:38:10.673 --> 03:38:13.276]  I want to do a quick update of what's going on in Colorado.
[03:38:13.276 --> 03:38:18.824]  Apparently the government has, they say, shot multiple people, including at least three police officers.
[03:38:18.824 --> 03:38:19.706]  This is out of the Independent.
[03:38:20.266 --> 03:38:23.789]  And he's barricaded himself inside the Planned Parenthood clinic.
[03:38:23.789 --> 03:38:27.972]  The last check 15 minutes ago, he was still inside.
[03:38:27.972 --> 03:38:35.458]  I'm sure there's going to be a giant SWAT team build up and they're going to launch in and hopefully no one else gets hurt in this.
[03:38:35.458 --> 03:38:39.561]  And I just can't wait to see how this story unravels.
[03:38:39.561 --> 03:38:48.587]  I mean, this is obviously sickening for somebody to go on a shooting rampage, especially when we really had Planned Parenthood up against the ropes, exposing him.
[03:38:49.808 --> 03:38:59.279]  Non-violently through video through their own words destroying Planned Parenthood and what they stand for just showing them as baby part merchants That's what these people are now.
[03:38:59.279 --> 03:39:04.925]  We have the Hillary Clinton free speech contest and I want to play this is a short video I'm going to play it's a
[03:39:05.626 --> 03:39:10.692]  Actually 31 seconds long, but it just goes to how short you can make a video to make a point.
[03:39:10.692 --> 03:39:15.517]  And then I'm going to show you some that are in the longer five minute range because five minutes is the cutoff for that.
[03:39:15.517 --> 03:39:16.679]  But let's go to this first one.
[03:39:16.679 --> 03:39:19.222]  Hillary Clinton, I think I am American.
[03:39:19.222 --> 03:39:19.882]  Infowars.com.
[03:39:23.667 --> 03:39:28.770]  Alright, there's the countdown going down and it's going to hit one and then it's going to start.
[03:39:28.770 --> 03:39:38.677]  I think I'm an American.
[03:39:38.677 --> 03:39:39.698]  I'm running for president.
[03:39:44.946 --> 03:39:45.486]  There it is.
[03:39:45.486 --> 03:39:47.887]  That's how quickly you can make a point.
[03:39:47.887 --> 03:39:50.929]  And it's not about either winning or losing the contest.
[03:39:50.929 --> 03:39:59.933]  It's about making these videos and putting them out on YouTube and having other people click on them and start deprogramming, because that's what we have to do.
[03:39:59.933 --> 03:40:01.453]  Let's go to Pete in Michigan.
[03:40:01.453 --> 03:40:02.994]  He wants to tell us what he's thankful for.
[03:40:02.994 --> 03:40:05.175]  Pete, how are you doing today?
[03:40:05.175 --> 03:40:05.755]  Good, good.
[03:40:05.755 --> 03:40:10.477]  I just wanted to say that the thing I'm most thankful for now is you guys there at InfoWars.
[03:40:10.477 --> 03:40:12.038]  I've been a listener for eight years.
[03:40:12.998 --> 03:40:15.557]  And you guys have really opened my eyes to a lot of things.
[03:40:16.684 --> 03:40:17.585]  Well, thank you.
[03:40:17.585 --> 03:40:18.585]  We appreciate that.
[03:40:18.585 --> 03:40:26.812]  And let me tell you, my eyes are opened every day here just seeing the news, the vast variety of tips that we get from around the world.
[03:40:26.812 --> 03:40:33.257]  People like you out there calling in, emailing, just doing your part and keeping everybody informed, especially on local issues.
[03:40:33.257 --> 03:40:42.444]  Because when we see stuff going on locally, we can see where it's being either funded federally or how it's going to be a trend coming up in, you know, say the next few months or so.
[03:40:42.444 --> 03:40:43.605]  So thank you, Pete.
[03:40:43.605 --> 03:40:44.165]  Thank you for that.
[03:40:44.165 --> 03:40:45.606]  We got Chris in Indiana.
[03:40:45.606 --> 03:40:46.227]  How are you doing today?
[03:40:47.711 --> 03:40:48.512]  I am doing great.
[03:40:48.512 --> 03:40:49.673]  God bless you for taking my call.
[03:40:49.673 --> 03:40:51.874]  I'm going to spit some stuff out so you can go to your next caller.
[03:40:51.874 --> 03:40:54.036]  All right.
[03:40:54.036 --> 03:40:57.278]  First of all, I'd like to be thankful for our amazing God.
[03:40:57.278 --> 03:40:58.899]  He gives us challenges.
[03:40:58.899 --> 03:41:02.682]  He presents things to us and shows us.
[03:41:02.682 --> 03:41:08.486]  And He brought Jesus here to show us that amazing love that He has.
[03:41:08.486 --> 03:41:11.208]  And I'm just so thankful for that.
[03:41:11.208 --> 03:41:14.951]  First of all, the North American Islamic Society is in our town.
[03:41:16.232 --> 03:41:18.714]  It looks like a freaking fortress.
[03:41:18.714 --> 03:41:21.855]  And they have a stance on their website.
[03:41:21.855 --> 03:41:29.519]  If you go onto their website, ISNA.net, it shows their stance and their position on it.
[03:41:29.519 --> 03:41:33.021]  Second of all, my drum circles, I want to get some drum circles going every Saturday.
[03:41:33.021 --> 03:41:36.003]  People need to be getting up and standing up for America.
[03:41:37.091 --> 03:41:39.833]  God bless our country, and I am so proud of our country.
[03:41:39.833 --> 03:41:44.397]  We need to be having drum circles and get everybody together underneath that banner, that American flag.
[03:41:44.397 --> 03:41:45.457]  Get excited about this.
[03:41:45.457 --> 03:41:48.540]  I want to thank my governor, Mike Pence.
[03:41:48.540 --> 03:41:53.103]  I sent him an email, and I thank him for securing our way of life, our culture, our freedom.
[03:41:53.103 --> 03:41:56.666]  He put his life on the line to stand up for our state.
[03:41:57.666 --> 03:41:58.667]  That's where the power lies.
[03:41:58.667 --> 03:41:59.628]  It's in the people.
[03:41:59.628 --> 03:42:00.748]  Fiscal responsibility.
[03:42:00.748 --> 03:42:03.910]  I asked him for fiscal responsibility and the refugees will stop that.
[03:42:03.910 --> 03:42:04.850]  Controlled dialogue.
[03:42:04.850 --> 03:42:07.172]  The social media has been controlling dialogue.
[03:42:07.172 --> 03:42:08.973]  People are scared to stand up.
[03:42:08.973 --> 03:42:09.913]  They're controlling that.
[03:42:09.913 --> 03:42:12.014]  They are censoring it.
[03:42:12.014 --> 03:42:13.315]  And they make you feel guilty.
[03:42:13.315 --> 03:42:14.476]  There's hypocrisy.
[03:42:14.476 --> 03:42:18.198]  You know, because we need to keep our families safe and our country safe.
[03:42:18.198 --> 03:42:19.479]  They didn't even talk about it.
[03:42:19.479 --> 03:42:21.560]  They bullied these refugees.
[03:42:21.560 --> 03:42:22.920]  The prayer is working, guys.
[03:42:22.920 --> 03:42:23.501]  Keep praying.
[03:42:23.501 --> 03:42:24.301]  God bless you.
[03:42:24.301 --> 03:42:24.842]  Thank you.
[03:42:24.842 --> 03:42:25.122]  I'm done.
[03:42:25.862 --> 03:42:35.007]  Well, I guarantee you some of these refugees that are coming across are going to be carrying some sickness, parasites, who knows what they're going to be bringing across.
[03:42:35.007 --> 03:42:39.029]  And our FBI chief has said we can't vet these people properly.
[03:42:39.029 --> 03:42:43.612]  So it's a crazy situation that we're dealing with now.
[03:42:43.612 --> 03:42:45.193]  And it's a situation that we helped start.
[03:42:45.373 --> 03:42:49.995]  Why with all this regime change and going into different countries and bombing the heck out of them.
[03:42:49.995 --> 03:42:57.238]  So we definitely are responsible for people wanting to leave their countries right now, whether it's because of these wars or not.
[03:42:57.238 --> 03:43:03.741]  They're definitely using the excuse of our bombing activities to jump ship and go into other places.
[03:43:03.741 --> 03:43:06.682]  And ISIS is definitely taking advantage of that.
[03:43:06.682 --> 03:43:11.705]  Let's go to our, I don't know if this will be our final caller, but for a little bit, this is Douglas in California.
[03:43:12.905 --> 03:43:17.266]  From sheeple to awake, did you just recently go through that transition?
[03:43:17.266 --> 03:43:28.609]  No, it's been a four year unbelievable awakening from CNN, work your job, do what you're told, believe everything you're fed, and get in line.
[03:43:28.609 --> 03:43:30.590]  To, who's Alex Jones?
[03:43:30.590 --> 03:43:31.370]  What?
[03:43:31.370 --> 03:43:35.531]  Wait, and then you have that deep sense of, oh no.
[03:43:36.354 --> 03:43:39.075]  This fear that you can't control.
[03:43:39.075 --> 03:43:40.896]  In other words, you're going, I've been lied to.
[03:43:40.896 --> 03:43:42.336]  I've been what?
[03:43:42.336 --> 03:43:42.856]  What?
[03:43:42.856 --> 03:43:44.797]  This can't be real.
[03:43:44.797 --> 03:43:46.497]  I'm telling everyone out there.
[03:43:46.497 --> 03:43:56.080]  I didn't even know I ended up on this list that the government has called the Office of Foreign Asset Control by mistake because my name was Douglas.
[03:43:56.080 --> 03:44:00.722]  I have been fighting in court for four years to have my assets unlocked.
[03:44:01.786 --> 03:44:10.777]  To actually work, to be able to work legally in the United States, because my middle name was Douglas, and I'm on the internet, so I know who's ever listening.
[03:44:10.777 --> 03:44:13.380]  They can always do a search for people that are on this OFAC list.
[03:44:13.380 --> 03:44:15.122]  You'll see my name there.
[03:44:15.122 --> 03:44:16.284]  And just recently,
[03:44:16.964 --> 03:44:26.612]  Just recently, the Supreme Court took up my court case only because I got on my hands and knees and started looking for God, seeking God with all my heart, with all my soul.
[03:44:26.612 --> 03:44:29.654]  And that's what it's going to take to get through these evil times.
[03:44:29.654 --> 03:44:31.736]  We don't fight against flesh and blood.
[03:44:31.736 --> 03:44:33.618]  We fight against principalities and powers.
[03:44:33.618 --> 03:44:36.920]  These people, they may not even know what they're doing.
[03:44:36.920 --> 03:44:40.183]  But it's putting God first in our life over other things.
[03:44:40.183 --> 03:44:44.046]  That's how, you know, I'd like to kind of, you know, wake people up
[03:44:44.682 --> 03:45:12.957]  You've got to be awake because there's so many schemes going on out there, our government, I don't know what it's all about, but I know one thing, that there is a living God, Jesus is Christ, you know, and even in the Surah, I read the Qur'an, and it says, in the Qur'an, okay, it says, O Muhammad, this is Surah 33, O Muhammad, the Book of Truth has been sent down to you, confirming what was before, is revealed to you, the Torah and the Gospel, they had the Book of Truth,
[03:45:14.019 --> 03:45:17.285]  And like men do, they change things.
[03:45:17.285 --> 03:45:18.206]  Okay?
[03:45:18.206 --> 03:45:19.688]  And that's what's happened.
[03:45:19.688 --> 03:45:20.930]  We need to get back to the Bible.
[03:45:21.854 --> 03:45:26.998]  Yeah, they change things to suit themselves at that particular time in history.
[03:45:26.998 --> 03:45:28.099]  Thank you for that call, Douglas.
[03:45:28.099 --> 03:45:30.601]  And send me some information on your case.
[03:45:30.601 --> 03:45:32.342]  Anybody can email me your tips out there.
[03:45:32.342 --> 03:45:35.104]  robd, r-o-b-d, at infowars.com.
[03:45:35.104 --> 03:45:36.565]  Put hey rob in the subject line.
[03:45:36.565 --> 03:45:39.247]  I do read 90% of my emails.
[03:45:39.247 --> 03:45:40.428]  I do get a ton of them.
[03:45:40.428 --> 03:45:44.351]  And I can't always reply to you out there, but I do look at your links.
[03:45:44.351 --> 03:45:45.412]  I look at everything.
[03:45:45.412 --> 03:45:47.413]  And I want to go to one more of these.
[03:45:48.594 --> 03:45:50.036]  Uh, contest.
[03:45:50.036 --> 03:45:54.402]  This is, uh, Hillary Clinton supporter destroysinfowars.com.
[03:45:54.402 --> 03:45:57.466]  This one's, uh, about, it's right, it's four minutes, 59 seconds.
[03:45:57.466 --> 03:45:59.568]  So right under that five minute mark.
[03:45:59.568 --> 03:46:01.331]  And, uh, this guy does some great stuff.
[03:46:01.331 --> 03:46:02.692]  We've played his videos in the past.
[03:46:02.692 --> 03:46:04.174]  It's no more news.
[03:46:04.935 --> 03:46:07.736]  Which is no, K-N-O-W, no more.
[03:46:07.736 --> 03:46:09.016]  And that's what we all need to do.
[03:46:09.016 --> 03:46:11.917]  And it's kind of what our caller just alluded to back there.
[03:46:11.917 --> 03:46:13.177]  We have to know more.
[03:46:13.177 --> 03:46:19.278]  And you know, you suddenly are awakened to what the system is when you have a confrontation with the system.
[03:46:19.278 --> 03:46:22.039]  And you realize that it's not what it's all meant to be.
[03:46:22.039 --> 03:46:23.379]  It's not all mom and apple pie.
[03:46:23.379 --> 03:46:25.400]  These people are predators coming after us.
[03:46:25.400 --> 03:46:26.520]  So let's go to that video now.
[03:46:28.137 --> 03:46:35.399]  The right-wing nutjob conspiracy theorist Alex Jones from InfoWars.com is such a racist, sexist, homophobic, bigoted Republican.
[03:46:35.399 --> 03:46:43.042]  You've probably seen his lunatic conspiracy theories exposed by various reputable media outlets such as Salon, Raw Story, Media Matters, or MSNBC.
[03:46:43.302 --> 03:46:45.784]  But his latest stunt has taken things way too far.
[03:46:45.784 --> 03:46:54.830]  He just announced a contest to get his cult minion followers to create hateful, intolerant YouTube videos, making fun of the next President of the United States, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[03:46:54.830 --> 03:46:58.572]  Just because the Hillary campaign threatened the Laugh Factory for making jokes about Ms.
[03:46:58.572 --> 03:47:00.694]  Clinton, doesn't give him the right to criticize her.
[03:47:00.834 --> 03:47:04.959]  What makes him think he can invade her safe space with his disgusting hate speech anyway?
[03:47:04.959 --> 03:47:07.322]  Alex Jones and InfoWars are totally irrelevant.
[03:47:07.322 --> 03:47:08.703]  They're just a vocal minority.
[03:47:08.703 --> 03:47:16.072]  If you Google top political websites and click on the first link, they're only the 7th biggest website on the list with 13 million unique visitors to their website per month.
[03:47:16.192 --> 03:47:17.453]  But look at who is above them.
[03:47:17.453 --> 03:47:19.795]  HuffPo number one and Salon number six.
[03:47:19.795 --> 03:47:20.756]  Hashtag winning!
[03:47:20.756 --> 03:47:24.259]  What can InfoWars and their fringe followers possibly say about Hillary anyway?
[03:47:24.259 --> 03:47:25.680]  That she's too good of a role model?
[03:47:25.680 --> 03:47:26.501]  Too beautiful?
[03:47:26.501 --> 03:47:28.023]  That her hair is too fabulous?
[03:47:28.023 --> 03:47:29.464]  Or that she's too inspirational?
[03:47:29.464 --> 03:47:30.965]  She's never done anything wrong!
[03:47:30.965 --> 03:47:33.387]  So I have a message for you, Mr. Alex Jones.
[03:47:33.387 --> 03:47:36.670]  None of the venomous hate you spew towards Hillary will phase her at all.
[03:47:36.670 --> 03:47:39.373]  She will just laugh it off with her contagious, majestic laugh.
[03:47:40.973 --> 03:47:42.334]  Doesn't she sound like an angel?
[03:47:42.334 --> 03:47:46.215]  I can't wait to see the hate and lies that these info warriors come up with.
[03:47:46.215 --> 03:47:52.917]  They will probably try to say that she can't even keep her man satisfied because her husband Bill Clinton cheated on her all the time with tons of women.
[03:47:52.917 --> 03:47:58.679]  She stood by her man and viciously attacked and ridiculed all the women who came forward about Bill's aggressive sexual abuse.
[03:47:58.679 --> 03:48:01.199]  Did you call her a narcissistic looney tune?
[03:48:01.199 --> 03:48:04.140]  I am not going to comment on what I did or did not say.
[03:48:04.140 --> 03:48:06.381]  Isn't she just a strong, independent woman?
[03:48:06.581 --> 03:48:09.224]  Just look at her recent tweet about the sexual abuse of women.
[03:48:09.224 --> 03:48:11.106]  She totally cares about the rape victims.
[03:48:11.106 --> 03:48:14.891]  Like when she defended a child rapist she knew was guilty in 1975 and laughed about it.
[03:48:14.891 --> 03:48:18.355]  Mrs. Clinton seems to admit she knew the defendant was guilty.
[03:48:18.355 --> 03:48:21.538]  The whole Monica Lewinsky scandal was just a right-wing conspiracy theory.
[03:48:21.538 --> 03:48:23.020]  Hillary Clinton totally debunked it.
[03:48:24.301 --> 03:48:30.966]  God, I hate the stupid, mouth-breathing, knuckle-dragging Republicans.
[03:48:30.966 --> 03:48:38.472]  They're always trying to say Hillary and Bill Clinton's foundation took millions of dollars for private jets, and that the foundation is full of Monsanto and giant corporate connections.
[03:48:38.632 --> 03:48:39.173]  Alright, that'll do.
[03:48:56.232 --> 03:48:59.094]  That was awesome there, and that's from No More News.
[03:48:59.094 --> 03:49:01.255]  You can watch the rest of that.
[03:49:01.255 --> 03:49:05.218]  I'm going to get the writers to post that one up along with a couple others.
[03:49:05.218 --> 03:49:13.383]  We have another one of a young lady, Jenna Marbles, who actually embodies Hillary Clinton, and I'll play that one in a second here.
[03:49:13.383 --> 03:49:16.125]  I think we've got a little bit of time left.
[03:49:16.125 --> 03:49:17.926]  What time we go out to break?
[03:49:17.926 --> 03:49:18.206]  Yeah.
[03:49:19.707 --> 03:49:21.308]  I might not have time for this one.
[03:49:21.308 --> 03:49:23.569]  But I'll get them to post all three of these.
[03:49:23.569 --> 03:49:26.430]  Jenna, I just want to let you know, put InfoWars.com in the title.
[03:49:26.430 --> 03:49:30.632]  In order to be eligible to win, you have to have InfoWars.com in the title for these.
[03:49:30.632 --> 03:49:38.956]  And $5,000 is at stake for first prize, $1,000 for second prize, third prize gets the Hillary for prison t-shirt and the laughing Hillary pin.
[03:49:39.896 --> 03:49:46.359]  And everybody wins by participating in this, by putting these videos out there, by spreading them around.
[03:49:46.359 --> 03:49:51.362]  We can show people, especially that video right there that No More News produced.
[03:49:51.362 --> 03:49:55.343]  I mean, that is just, it's filled with all this...
[03:49:57.247 --> 03:50:10.785]  You know, it's so funny, you know, he's acting like a Hillary supporter but basically showing everything that we've said and proven in the past about Hillary Clinton and how much of a demon she really is and how we need to get rid of this nepotism, this...
[03:50:12.247 --> 03:50:16.652]  It's just this king and queen lineage that we now have, you know, going in through the White House.
[03:50:16.652 --> 03:50:26.604]  If you look at Bush and the Bushes and the Clintons and how Obama's kind of a hybrid of both of them and, you know, we're looking at maybe a Jeb Bush or a Clinton, Hillary Clinton for president.
[03:50:26.604 --> 03:50:29.708]  Although I think Jeb is really just circling the toilet bowl at this point.
[03:50:30.869 --> 03:50:33.351]  So we're gonna be back and actually we come back from break.
[03:50:33.351 --> 03:50:37.273]  We're gonna answer the question is Black Friday racist.
[03:50:37.273 --> 03:50:42.897]  This is a report Josh Owens and Liam McAdoo put together and That'll be it for the fourth hour.
[03:50:42.897 --> 03:50:44.398]  That's our Black Friday edition.
[03:50:44.398 --> 03:50:49.681]  Sorry to the other callers out there Sorry, I didn't get to get to you, but you know call back.
[03:50:49.681 --> 03:50:50.442]  I guess on Monday.
[03:50:50.442 --> 03:50:54.624]  We'll be back here Infowars.com We got still got one segment left is Black Friday racist.
[03:50:54.624 --> 03:50:55.485]  We're gonna answer that question
[03:50:58.999 --> 03:51:01.502]  Don't take a cold or flu lying down.

[03:53:03.338 --> 03:53:18.543]  As many of you have come to know, IDStronghold.com is the number one name in quality RFID blocking wallets that actually do as they say and prevent electronic pickpocketing of the new RFID chips found in credit cards, room keys, subway passes, and more.
[03:53:19.043 --> 03:53:28.665]  Last year, due to the extreme popularity of giving ID Stronghold wallets and clutches as unique gifts at Christmastime, we ran out of our most popular styles and colors early.
[03:53:28.665 --> 03:53:33.007]  The good news is, we now have our holiday inventory ready for same-day shipping.
[03:53:33.007 --> 03:53:44.509]  We have added many more designs of beautiful leather wallets and clutches, all with state-of-the-art built-in electronic pickpocket shielding from the most respected name in RFID protection, IDStronghold.com.
[03:53:44.509 --> 03:53:46.990]  Don't wait and limit your choices of these great gifts.
[03:53:47.350 --> 03:53:49.551]  We are expecting another sellout season.
[03:53:49.551 --> 03:53:51.832]  These wallets aren't available in stores.
[03:53:51.832 --> 03:53:54.633]  So visit IDStronghold.com today.
[03:53:54.633 --> 03:53:58.995]  That's IDStronghold.com.
[03:53:58.995 --> 03:54:08.619]  There's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway.
[03:54:25.812 --> 03:54:30.355]  Black Friday has a racist connotation.
[03:54:30.355 --> 03:54:31.455]  Not really.
[03:54:31.455 --> 03:54:32.516]  Honestly, yeah.
[03:54:32.516 --> 03:54:36.619]  Thinking about that, I'd never really thought about it in that way with racist connotations.
[03:54:36.619 --> 03:54:42.482]  I can see how it could be definitely offensive to people.
[03:54:42.482 --> 03:54:45.244]  I don't know where my opinion stands on it.
[03:54:45.244 --> 03:54:49.346]  As far as that goes... Sorry, I'm just kidding.
[03:54:49.346 --> 03:54:53.909]  I'm not familiar with the historical connotations of Black Friday.
[03:54:55.018 --> 03:54:57.999]  So, I'm not sure if that question even applies or not.
[03:54:57.999 --> 03:54:59.840]  Like, it could, it could not, but I just don't know.
[03:54:59.840 --> 03:55:03.201]  I don't even know what the beginning of Black... What is, like, the beginnings of Black Friday?
[03:55:03.201 --> 03:55:04.781]  What is, like, the origin of it?
[03:55:04.781 --> 03:55:22.166]  Well, no one really knows, but there are a lot of things that people are alleging, and it's kind of like a Black Lives Matter concern with this, that it had something to do with slavery, and that they would sell their slaves at a discount in order to, you know, get the plantations filled with workers for the harsh winter.
[03:55:22.166 --> 03:55:24.307]  I think I did hear that before.
[03:55:25.208 --> 03:55:29.353]  But I mean, now they do it for discount items.
[03:55:29.353 --> 03:55:32.977]  Every year, people get a little bit offended by it.
[03:55:32.977 --> 03:55:33.557]  Really?
[03:55:34.392 --> 03:55:36.113]  I didn't even know that, dude.
[03:55:36.113 --> 03:55:38.074]  Okay, the problem is who is being offended?
[03:55:38.074 --> 03:55:41.255]  Like, is it, like, the non-black community or is it the black community?
[03:55:41.255 --> 03:55:47.558]  Because if the black community is offended, then I would be more for changing it than if, like, someone who wasn't black was offended.
[03:55:47.558 --> 03:55:52.000]  You know, because they're the only ones who get to decide whether or not something has offensive connotations to them.
[03:55:52.000 --> 03:55:55.242]  Because their community has lived through the historical implications.
[03:55:55.242 --> 03:55:57.963]  Do you think we should rename Black Friday?
[03:55:57.963 --> 03:56:00.384]  No.
[03:56:00.384 --> 03:56:01.805]  No?
[03:56:01.805 --> 03:56:02.886]  No.
[03:56:02.886 --> 03:56:03.426]  Why is that?
[03:56:05.086 --> 03:56:07.967]  Have you checked your privilege?
[03:56:07.967 --> 03:56:11.789]  Well, actually, I'm gonna reverse that statement now that I actually thought it through.
[03:56:11.789 --> 03:56:13.969]  I can see where racism would come up.
[03:56:13.969 --> 03:56:15.790]  There should definitely be a new name for it.
[03:56:15.790 --> 03:56:19.311]  Um... I'm not sure, but... Any ideas?
[03:56:19.311 --> 03:56:27.275]  Something that would be more color neutral, or... I mean, I wouldn't go color then, since that's still, like, race implied, I guess.
[03:56:27.275 --> 03:56:32.336]  No, if people agree with that opinion, then yeah, of course, it's... It's not right, but what would they change it to?
[03:56:32.336 --> 03:56:33.377]  Do you have any ideas?
[03:56:34.608 --> 03:56:35.949]  African American Friday.
[03:56:35.949 --> 03:56:37.590]  Okay.
[03:56:37.590 --> 03:56:38.551]  That's a good potential.
[03:56:38.551 --> 03:56:40.612]  You gotta have something that has a ring to it.
[03:56:40.612 --> 03:56:42.033]  Yeah, that's the thing.
[03:56:42.033 --> 03:56:44.294]  You can't think of anything that has a ring to it.
[03:56:44.294 --> 03:56:46.696]  At least they didn't use the N word.
[03:56:46.696 --> 03:56:49.618]  The annual Walmart Brawl.
[03:56:49.618 --> 03:56:50.098]  How about that?
[03:57:09.652 --> 03:57:21.418]  Showing now some massive hordes of zombies pouring into a Walmart.
[03:57:21.418 --> 03:57:22.438]  There's a man crying.
[03:57:22.438 --> 03:57:25.519]  He didn't get his Black Friday gift.
[03:57:25.519 --> 03:57:27.080]  It sounds like an awful way to spend a day.
[03:57:27.080 --> 03:57:29.201]  Getting beat up.
[03:57:29.201 --> 03:57:33.683]  Maybe they call it Black Friday because you have to be like a black belt in karate to, you know.
[03:57:33.683 --> 03:57:34.384]  That could be it.
[03:57:34.384 --> 03:57:35.104]  Discount day.
[03:57:36.147 --> 03:57:39.349]  Don't kill each other day, please.
[03:57:39.349 --> 03:57:40.569]  That's not for me to decide.
[03:57:40.569 --> 03:57:45.172]  That's for the community to decide what is and isn't offensive to them and what's a suitable replacement.
[03:57:45.172 --> 03:57:47.253]  Racist or not racist?
[03:57:47.253 --> 03:57:47.933]  Not racist.
[03:57:47.933 --> 03:57:51.976]  I think people would have to speak up.
[03:57:51.976 --> 03:57:59.760]  And if people were to say something, if it was something that was heard by the population, I think people would sympathize with it if it was something that they felt was racist.
[03:58:00.967 --> 03:58:08.672]  So even if it's not necessarily true, though, I see a lot on college campuses right now, a lot of things are happening because of the way people feel.
[03:58:08.672 --> 03:58:14.936]  Because they're offended, because it's... Alright, you can watch the rest of that at InfoWars.com or check out the Alex Jones Channel.
